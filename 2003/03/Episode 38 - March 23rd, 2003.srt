1
00:00:06,624 --> 00:00:10,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

2
00:00:12,131 --> 00:00:17,178
[SPEAKER_03]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

3
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:23,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:30,531

00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:33,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

7
00:00:34,752 --> 00:00:35,152
[SPEAKER_28]: Just kidding.

8
00:00:35,352 --> 00:00:36,952
[SPEAKER_28]: Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

9
00:00:37,172 --> 00:00:44,594
[SPEAKER_37]: In this episode... Hey, are there any balls down there?

10
00:00:44,894 --> 00:00:47,355
[SPEAKER_37]: That's the biggest bear you've ever seen, Jingleberry.

11
00:00:47,435 --> 00:00:49,175
[SPEAKER_37]: What's your favorite scary movie?

00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Showgirls.

13
00:00:52,073 --> 00:00:53,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolute fright.

14
00:00:53,494 --> 00:00:54,275
[SPEAKER_05]: What's yours?

15
00:00:54,315 --> 00:00:56,777
[SPEAKER_05]: There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

16
00:00:56,837 --> 00:00:58,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't torture yourself.

17
00:00:58,738 --> 00:00:59,759
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my job.

18
00:00:59,779 --> 00:01:01,460
[SPEAKER_37]: Now's the time our sprockets made me dogs!

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,144
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too!

20
00:01:06,564 --> 00:01:07,425
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Kung Fu.

21
00:01:07,845 --> 00:01:10,447
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

22
00:01:10,507 --> 00:01:12,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Why did they have to take the word gang?

23
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,412
[SPEAKER_13]: No one expects a Spanish exposition!

24
00:01:16,872 --> 00:01:17,713
[SPEAKER_13]: It's Kendo.

25
00:01:17,773 --> 00:01:18,153

[SPEAKER_28]: We hope it stays this way through the whole show.

30
00:01:51,555 --> 00:01:58,200

35
00:02:19,538 --> 00:02:20,799
[SPEAKER_15]: I still think it's Versace.

36
00:02:21,179 --> 00:02:27,062
[SPEAKER_24]: In that corner wearing a lovely Calvin Klein garb is Loki.

37
00:02:27,562 --> 00:02:29,803

45
00:02:57,028 --> 00:02:59,009
[SPEAKER_18]: He's the... No, he's the key grip.

00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:01,730
[SPEAKER_28]: Fuck you, man.

[SPEAKER_28]: It's okay to talk on the mic.

52
00:03:15,475 --> 00:03:16,977
[SPEAKER_28]: Quit giving head to the propel and talk.

53
00:03:17,537 --> 00:03:20,160
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not going to hurt you.

54
00:03:20,521 --> 00:03:21,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, it's cute.

00:03:21,622 --> 00:03:22,363

00:03:33,498 --> 00:03:34,599
[SPEAKER_28]: They're just not here yet.

60
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:39,383
[SPEAKER_28]: A rice princess is somewhere in the house, but she must be... Oh, she went to get food.

61
00:03:39,483 --> 00:03:40,463
[SPEAKER_28]: We have DDRholic coming.

00:03:45,868 --> 00:03:46,368
[SPEAKER_28]: That'll be fun.

67
00:03:46,388 --> 00:03:46,708
[SPEAKER_28]: If they get here.

68
00:03:47,048 --> 00:03:47,569
[SPEAKER_28]: If they get here.

69
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:48,950
[SPEAKER_28]: Hopefully they didn't get lost.

70
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,391
[SPEAKER_28]: You did draw them a good map, right?

71
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:51,131
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course.

72
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:51,592
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course.

73
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:54,734
[SPEAKER_18]: I gave written directions and then I drew a map that said which house it was.

74
00:03:55,315 --> 00:03:56,716
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I didn't remember your house number.

75
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:58,792
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, okay.

76
00:03:59,893 --> 00:04:03,375
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob lives at blank, blank, blank, blankity, blank, blank.

77
00:04:03,435 --> 00:04:03,955
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, you know what?

78
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:07,137
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm moving in a month, so it won't matter.

79
00:04:08,418 --> 00:04:09,279
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, he probably don't.

80
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,900
[SPEAKER_28]: He thinks Pomani's weird enough as it is.

81
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,901
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my god, it's this guy's house.

82
00:04:12,921 --> 00:04:14,002
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my god, oh my god.

83
00:04:15,481 --> 00:04:22,330
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, we'll be talking about tons of stuff a little bit more later, including announcing the March Madness 2DX qualifiers.

84
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,015
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll talk to Mike Ngo, we'll talk to everybody, but first, Daikin Kai, the long version.

85
00:04:27,076 --> 00:04:27,816
[SPEAKER_28]: Enjoy, we'll be back.

86
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:13,791

[SPEAKER_37]: I'm just a boy, I got beat!

00:06:32,668 --> 00:06:33,749
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm just a boy, I got beat!

[SPEAKER_28]: Live here for episode number 38.

100
00:09:52,173 --> 00:09:53,394
[SPEAKER_28]: Whatever happened to SoCalKicks?

101
00:09:53,414 --> 00:09:57,216
[SPEAKER_28]: I hardly ever see him in the chair anymore.

102
00:09:57,377 --> 00:09:58,117
[SPEAKER_28]: Quit eating everybody.

103
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:58,637
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm just kidding.

104
00:09:59,718 --> 00:09:59,938
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway.

105
00:10:00,178 --> 00:10:02,480
[SPEAKER_28]: No, my fur!

106
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,921
[SPEAKER_28]: It's kind of a crazy house tonight.

107
00:10:03,941 --> 00:10:03,981
[SPEAKER_28]: No!

108
00:10:04,241 --> 00:10:04,421
[SPEAKER_18]: No!

109
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:10,323
[SPEAKER_28]: Everybody's all hyper.

110
00:10:11,343 --> 00:10:13,164
[SPEAKER_28]: Everybody's all hyper about the Oscars.

111
00:10:13,204 --> 00:10:18,247
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, because Spirited Away fucking won.

112
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:19,448
[SPEAKER_30]: That's all that matters.

113
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:23,010
[SPEAKER_18]: I have to make a new ad.

114
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,631
[SPEAKER_30]: What are they called again?

115
00:10:24,651 --> 00:10:25,831
[SPEAKER_18]: They came up with the best name.

116
00:10:26,372 --> 00:10:26,792
[SPEAKER_29]: Shingles.

117
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:28,393
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, the Pringles.

118
00:10:28,413 --> 00:10:29,673
[SPEAKER_18]: That tastes like shit.

119
00:10:30,754 --> 00:10:32,095
[SPEAKER_18]: Everybody, go to this address.

120
00:10:32,175 --> 00:10:32,655
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob, type it up.

121
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:42,133
[SPEAKER_18]: www.sakuramani.com slash scattles.

122
00:10:42,453 --> 00:10:43,113
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I take that back.

123
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:43,513
[SPEAKER_18]: They're not there.

124
00:10:44,213 --> 00:10:44,534
[SPEAKER_18]: Go back.

125
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:45,674
[SPEAKER_18]: Go back.

126
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:48,775
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not www anything.

127
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:57,818
[SPEAKER_18]: Members.aol.com slash darksakura slash scattles dot jpg.

128
00:10:58,818 --> 00:10:59,419
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's it.

129
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,639
[SPEAKER_18]: I might want to click it to see if it works.

130
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:06,915
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what I do when I'm bored, is I take products and then make, like, foul approximates of them.

131
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:09,415
[SPEAKER_18]: It's either .jpg or .gif.

132
00:11:12,196 --> 00:11:12,496
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

133
00:11:12,776 --> 00:11:14,097
[SPEAKER_18]: But that's what I do when I get bored.

134
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:15,477
[SPEAKER_18]: I find neat products.

135
00:11:16,037 --> 00:11:16,918
[SPEAKER_18]: It is .jpg.

136
00:11:19,158 --> 00:11:20,099
[SPEAKER_18]: No, not neat.

137
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:23,700
[SPEAKER_18]: I find products and then I make them, um, a little bit different.

138
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,001
[SPEAKER_28]: You should have made them all brown, though, instead of, like... What?

139
00:11:29,262 --> 00:11:29,982
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm being summoned.

140
00:11:30,746 --> 00:11:31,268
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura.com

141
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,180
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

142
00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:39,322
[SPEAKER_28]: Question from the chat room.

143
00:11:39,362 --> 00:11:42,623
[SPEAKER_28]: Did the Disney version of Spirited Away win or did the original Japanese one?

144
00:11:42,683 --> 00:11:44,725
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, it would be the Disney one.

145
00:11:44,845 --> 00:11:48,407
[SPEAKER_28]: But that's because... Well, I don't really know why that is.

146
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:52,269
[SPEAKER_28]: I think that's just because to the Oscars it's the same movie.

147
00:11:52,669 --> 00:11:53,809
[SPEAKER_28]: Just a different language track.

148
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,890
[SPEAKER_28]: But it's still the same visual.

149
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:55,310
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

150
00:11:55,671 --> 00:11:56,571
[SPEAKER_28]: But yeah, the Disney one won.

151
00:11:59,252 --> 00:11:59,673
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway.

152
00:12:00,013 --> 00:12:02,334
[SPEAKER_28]: Wow, what a busy week.

153
00:12:02,454 --> 00:12:03,395
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm so exhausted.

154
00:12:03,635 --> 00:12:04,555
[SPEAKER_18]: I was impressed.

155
00:12:04,715 --> 00:12:05,636
[SPEAKER_18]: She pronounced his name right.

156
00:12:06,698 --> 00:12:07,839
[SPEAKER_28]: She probably had a lot of training.

157
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:09,721
[SPEAKER_28]: Cameron Diaz probably had to be coached backstage.

158
00:12:09,741 --> 00:12:12,124
[SPEAKER_28]: Can I just give somebody heads?

159
00:12:12,384 --> 00:12:12,745
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway.

160
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:39,999
[SPEAKER_28]: This is going to be the second tournament I've done that's been around times of unemployment for me.

161
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,680
[SPEAKER_18]: Give me a job!

162
00:12:44,601 --> 00:12:45,501
[SPEAKER_18]: That lion is demonic.

163
00:12:45,661 --> 00:12:46,341
[SPEAKER_28]: The lion is demonic.

164
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:52,623
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, we have March Madness coming up, which by the way means there will be no live show next Sunday because...

165
00:12:53,723 --> 00:12:56,245
[SPEAKER_28]: will be live all day, Saturday and Sunday.

166
00:12:56,365 --> 00:12:57,706
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll be all over the freaking place.

167
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:58,567
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh my god.

168
00:12:59,227 --> 00:13:02,710
[SPEAKER_18]: It's gonna be like Shaft was, except I get to do it for two days.

169
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:07,564
[SPEAKER_28]: And Loki, once again, gets to head up taking the reins all by himself.

170
00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:09,605
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, what are you guys doing?

171
00:13:10,345 --> 00:13:16,227
[SPEAKER_28]: I will be helping you 90% of the time, but I have to emcee the 2DX tournament.

172
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:19,628
[SPEAKER_28]: And then I'm going to be participating in one event, but I can't say what.

173
00:13:19,648 --> 00:13:20,588
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm doing everything else.

174
00:13:21,729 --> 00:13:22,569
[SPEAKER_18]: You're doing everything else?

175
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:23,609
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, just on the admin side.

176
00:13:23,689 --> 00:13:23,849
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

177
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:25,510
[SPEAKER_18]: But you'll be by to say hello, right?

178
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:29,311
[SPEAKER_18]: Getting volunteers, offering them potato chips and not paying anybody.

179
00:13:30,915 --> 00:13:32,777
[SPEAKER_28]: You'll say hi on the show, right?

180
00:13:32,797 --> 00:13:34,418
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course.

181
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:37,019
[SPEAKER_18]: It'll be like this.

182
00:13:41,923 --> 00:13:46,386
[SPEAKER_28]: What's going to be really cool about March Madness is that the machine's going to be set up outside, from what I understand.

183
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:49,388
[SPEAKER_28]: For those of you that are worried about glare, don't worry about it.

184
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:51,389
[SPEAKER_28]: The staff's already thought about it.

185
00:13:51,409 --> 00:13:55,472
[SPEAKER_28]: They're going to set it up in this tent thing with a lot of tarp, and they're going to set it perpendicular to the sun.

186
00:13:55,732 --> 00:13:57,973
[SPEAKER_28]: They have this all worked out, so don't worry.

187
00:13:58,194 --> 00:14:00,275
[SPEAKER_28]: You won't be able to get any glare on that.

188
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:07,939
[SPEAKER_28]: So, but what's cool about that, this is the machines outside, we're going to be, for any of those that have ever been to Scandia before, we're going to be out in the gazebo.

189
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:10,460
[SPEAKER_28]: So, you can't miss us.

190
00:14:10,821 --> 00:14:13,602
[SPEAKER_28]: This is what's cool about Scandia, letting us do that tournament there.

191
00:14:13,642 --> 00:14:16,664
[SPEAKER_28]: They cancelled all the parties, so we could have the party room and the gazebo.

192
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,645
[SPEAKER_28]: And Orange Lounge gets the gazebo, so that's pretty cool.

193
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:23,708
[SPEAKER_28]: Children, screw your birthday, we're having a DDR tournament.

194
00:14:24,508 --> 00:14:32,271
[SPEAKER_28]: Word of advice, if you're coming down to the tournament at Sacramento Scandia, and we hope you are, come early, because it's going to fill up fast.

195
00:14:32,311 --> 00:14:38,874
[SPEAKER_28]: Like the parking lot I'm talking about, because there's a lot of people expected to show up next Saturday between the normal patrons and the DDR tournament.

196
00:14:39,334 --> 00:14:42,315
[SPEAKER_28]: So come early to be sure that you can actually park nearby.

197
00:14:43,756 --> 00:14:44,696
[SPEAKER_28]: What are you mewing about?

198
00:14:44,756 --> 00:14:46,677
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to see what you noticed.

199
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:51,143
[SPEAKER_28]: So how was your week?

200
00:14:51,163 --> 00:14:51,984
[SPEAKER_28]: What'd you do this week, Jamie?

201
00:14:54,245 --> 00:14:54,886
[SPEAKER_28]: Screwed cats?

202
00:14:54,986 --> 00:14:55,246
[SPEAKER_28]: What?

203
00:14:56,787 --> 00:14:57,788
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't do shit.

204
00:14:59,029 --> 00:14:59,589
[SPEAKER_33]: What's that, Jamie?

205
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:00,410
[SPEAKER_33]: Timmy's caught in a well?

206
00:15:08,316 --> 00:15:09,316
[SPEAKER_24]: What's that, Timmy?

207
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:11,098
[SPEAKER_24]: Timmy?

208
00:15:12,859 --> 00:15:13,820
[SPEAKER_24]: Fuck it, I fucked it up!

209
00:15:15,862 --> 00:15:16,242
[SPEAKER_28]: What's that?

210
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:17,344
[SPEAKER_28]: Timmy's caught in your ass?

211
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:17,684
[SPEAKER_28]: What?

212
00:15:19,405 --> 00:15:19,806
[SPEAKER_28]: Gotcha.

213
00:15:20,446 --> 00:15:21,427
[SPEAKER_28]: Do anything fun this week, Jamie?

214
00:15:22,108 --> 00:15:22,869
[SPEAKER_18]: Went to a party.

215
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:23,830
[SPEAKER_18]: Watched Battle Royale.

216
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,253
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, last night was the big party at Zero's house.

217
00:15:27,353 --> 00:15:28,174
[SPEAKER_18]: We watched Battle Royale.

218
00:15:28,214 --> 00:15:29,355
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I still miss the beginning.

219
00:15:29,415 --> 00:15:35,541
[SPEAKER_18]: Every time I start to watch that movie, I either catch it in parts because I have to go to the bathroom and do the whole thing, or I miss the very beginning.

220
00:15:36,241 --> 00:15:37,362
[SPEAKER_18]: And I miss the beginning again.

221
00:15:37,923 --> 00:15:38,884
[SPEAKER_18]: Was that the special edition?

222
00:15:39,264 --> 00:15:40,045
[SPEAKER_18]: Or just the normal?

223
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:45,401
[SPEAKER_18]: I need a special edition now because there's a bunch of scenes that they cut out.

224
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:47,302
[SPEAKER_28]: Was this the song from the credits?

225
00:15:47,522 --> 00:15:49,203
[SPEAKER_28]: This song that you had very first on pre-show night?

226
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,424
[SPEAKER_28]: Because somebody recognized it.

227
00:15:52,905 --> 00:15:54,726
[SPEAKER_28]: Somebody in the chat room recognized it when it first played.

228
00:15:54,806 --> 00:15:56,868
[SPEAKER_18]: I downloaded it last night when I got home.

229
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:04,391
[SPEAKER_18]: Very cool.

230
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:08,033
[SPEAKER_28]: I didn't even know what to expect when I saw that movie.

231
00:16:08,053 --> 00:16:09,733
[SPEAKER_28]: Did you know about it?

232
00:16:09,933 --> 00:16:11,094
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I didn't even know anything about it.

233
00:16:11,194 --> 00:16:16,095
[SPEAKER_28]: I didn't even drink last night, so I was actually perfectly sober watching the movie, which at a party is actually a pretty rarity for me.

234
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,416
[SPEAKER_28]: But I'm just kind of sitting there going, I don't know.

235
00:16:18,576 --> 00:16:20,297
[SPEAKER_28]: Everybody was arguing about what movie you want to watch.

236
00:16:20,317 --> 00:16:21,317
[SPEAKER_28]: Some people want to watch Battle Royale.

237
00:16:21,337 --> 00:16:23,217
[SPEAKER_28]: Some people want to watch, what was it called, The Swimmers?

238
00:16:23,658 --> 00:16:24,378
[SPEAKER_28]: The Water Boys.

239
00:16:25,578 --> 00:16:36,504
[SPEAKER_18]: If you want to know more about Battle Royale, now the site does have a good bit of spoilers, but it's a very in-depth site, one of the best I found.

240
00:16:37,005 --> 00:16:40,707
[SPEAKER_18]: Go to BattleRoyaleOnline.com

241
00:16:42,308 --> 00:16:46,610
[SPEAKER_18]: and it actually is R-O-Y-A-L-E You know what?

242
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:54,374
[SPEAKER_30]: I was curious because in the background of the training video how they had www.br.com I'm wondering if that's... I went to that site.

243
00:16:54,434 --> 00:16:54,895
[SPEAKER_18]: It wasn't there.

244
00:16:55,475 --> 00:16:57,056
[SPEAKER_30]: How about br.co.jp?

245
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:57,956
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't try that.

246
00:16:58,277 --> 00:16:59,837
[SPEAKER_18]: Try br.co.jp.

247
00:17:00,558 --> 00:17:01,138
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, br.co.jp.

248
00:17:01,158 --> 00:17:02,179
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh-huh.

249
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:03,559
[SPEAKER_18]: Because there was not a br.com.

250
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:03,920
[SPEAKER_18]: I looked.

251
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,001
[SPEAKER_30]: Uh, probably not.

252
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:08,602
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

253
00:17:09,243 --> 00:17:09,703
[SPEAKER_18]: But, um...

254
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:11,085
[SPEAKER_18]: Nope.

255
00:17:11,826 --> 00:17:15,169
[SPEAKER_18]: But try that site, BattleRoyaleOnline.com.

256
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:15,689
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

257
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,692
[SPEAKER_28]: Explain the premise of Battle Royale, because we're talking about this movie.

258
00:17:18,712 --> 00:17:20,493
[SPEAKER_28]: We haven't talked about what it's about, for those that don't know.

259
00:17:20,553 --> 00:17:23,696
[SPEAKER_18]: Children do not respect their elders, and the world is thrown into chaos.

260
00:17:26,118 --> 00:17:34,125
[SPEAKER_18]: So they enact this thing called the Battle Royale Act, where they take a randomly pulled class of students... And put them in Iraq.

261
00:17:34,835 --> 00:17:44,723
[SPEAKER_18]: and put them on a deserted island and have them kill each other until there's one left and they have these little collars that make their necks explode in cool bloody ways

262
00:17:45,991 --> 00:17:47,292
[SPEAKER_18]: That was cool, but I like that guy.

263
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:48,653
[SPEAKER_28]: It was a really violent movie.

264
00:17:48,753 --> 00:17:55,358
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, if you like young children and violence... I like the guy that joined up for fun.

265
00:17:55,598 --> 00:17:57,059
[SPEAKER_30]: That guy kicked ass.

266
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:57,960
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh my god.

267
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,262
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I like the fact that... Sorry, Misako was the best one.

268
00:18:00,482 --> 00:18:02,263
[SPEAKER_15]: I like the fact that they're in 8th grade.

269
00:18:02,904 --> 00:18:04,885
[SPEAKER_15]: The slut was the coolest person.

270
00:18:05,506 --> 00:18:14,092
[SPEAKER_30]: I nominate for best student on the island for the males is gonna go to the guy that joined up for fun, and then of course, you know, best female would be the slut, yeah.

271
00:18:15,492 --> 00:18:17,093
[SPEAKER_28]: I was going to say something profound about the movie.

272
00:18:17,113 --> 00:18:18,013
[SPEAKER_18]: She got six kills.

273
00:18:18,594 --> 00:18:23,417
[SPEAKER_18]: That site that I just told you about, it has character profiles for like six of them.

274
00:18:24,677 --> 00:18:29,100
[SPEAKER_18]: And it actually has the cool slut girl's profile, including her family history and everything.

275
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,061
[SPEAKER_18]: She was a prostitute.

276
00:18:31,661 --> 00:18:32,802
[SPEAKER_18]: And she was pimping out other girls.

277
00:18:35,844 --> 00:18:39,826
[SPEAKER_18]: And she got six kills in the movie.

278
00:18:41,338 --> 00:19:06,397
[SPEAKER_28]: and actually this site is really cool because it has pictures of all of the scorecards so that's really cool and you know what's interesting about that movie what makes it a lot more fun if you imagine it being like 8th graders from your local Roseville Golf Land or your local arcade that pisses you off and then every time they run in front of that area between the pad and the machine that little necklace goes off and they explode hey I'd join up for fun to kill them

279
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,702
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, the best thing about that movie, it had the whole 90210 effect.

280
00:19:10,923 --> 00:19:12,224
[SPEAKER_29]: You have eighth graders that are like 30.

281
00:19:14,745 --> 00:19:15,646
[SPEAKER_18]: And you have your different types.

282
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,187
[SPEAKER_18]: You have the slut, you have the prep.

283
00:19:17,828 --> 00:19:20,009
[SPEAKER_29]: Then you have the loner guy, and you have the nerds.

284
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,771
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, the nerds were the best.

285
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:22,952
[SPEAKER_18]: The nerds were so cool.

286
00:19:22,972 --> 00:19:25,894
[SPEAKER_29]: I want a pot lid to kill people with, because that would be so cool.

287
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:26,695
[SPEAKER_18]: The pot lid saved him.

288
00:19:27,075 --> 00:19:28,296
[SPEAKER_29]: I know, that was the coolest part.

289
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:32,079
[SPEAKER_30]: I still think Gak did the best, he kicked ass.

290
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:32,259
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh yeah.

291
00:19:33,308 --> 00:19:37,852
[SPEAKER_28]: You might want to talk about Battle Royale 2, because you're given the website for it in the chatroom right now by Jazz.

292
00:19:37,892 --> 00:19:40,253
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, if you can get the link out of my live journal and post it in there.

293
00:19:40,354 --> 00:19:40,554
[SPEAKER_28]: Sure.

294
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:43,036
[SPEAKER_28]: Actually, Jazz just posted it in the chatroom for our convenience.

295
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:44,577
[SPEAKER_18]: Ah, thank you.

296
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:53,725
[SPEAKER_18]: Battle Royale 2 is set after, of course, Battle Royale, about three years afterwards, with the survivor.

297
00:19:54,265 --> 00:19:57,487
[SPEAKER_18]: And actually the other, I don't want to go into detail.

298
00:19:57,587 --> 00:19:57,848
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

299
00:19:57,968 --> 00:20:00,650
[SPEAKER_18]: There's another character who makes an important cameo, as far as I know.

300
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,751
[SPEAKER_18]: On that side, though, there's a cool thing.

301
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,033
[SPEAKER_18]: They have scenes of their rehearsal.

302
00:20:06,854 --> 00:20:08,075
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to play with your pussy.

303
00:20:09,436 --> 00:20:11,597
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie, please stop playing with Irene's pussy on the show.

304
00:20:11,617 --> 00:20:12,438
[SPEAKER_28]: Ooh, can I fist your pussy?

305
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:12,658
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

306
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:18,230
[SPEAKER_28]: Can you describe what the pussy is here, for those that are shocked and amazed right now?

307
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,430
[SPEAKER_14]: Dead cat.

308
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,531
[SPEAKER_14]: Where did you get that from?

309
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:21,591
[SPEAKER_14]: Hot gothic.

310
00:20:22,131 --> 00:20:23,572
[SPEAKER_14]: A long time ago, like three years ago.

311
00:20:23,632 --> 00:20:24,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, man.

312
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:24,492
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I know.

313
00:20:24,532 --> 00:20:25,432
[SPEAKER_14]: It's so cute.

314
00:20:25,772 --> 00:20:26,693
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and it's dead.

315
00:20:26,753 --> 00:20:29,294
[SPEAKER_14]: It's got X's for eyes, and it's got a pink tongue.

316
00:20:29,694 --> 00:20:31,754
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a panda for you at my house, by the way.

317
00:20:32,495 --> 00:20:33,635
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, thank you.

318
00:20:34,075 --> 00:20:36,896
[SPEAKER_14]: It's got an opening where the pussy is.

319
00:20:37,296 --> 00:20:38,216
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's pink inside.

320
00:20:38,296 --> 00:20:40,017
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, the interior is pink.

321
00:20:40,397 --> 00:20:41,357
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really cool.

322
00:20:42,238 --> 00:20:42,698
[SPEAKER_14]: Or whatever.

323
00:20:45,256 --> 00:20:46,937
[SPEAKER_28]: That was a lovely image, I'm sure.

324
00:20:47,297 --> 00:20:49,799
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sure our listeners are happy that we could share that with all of you.

325
00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:50,559
[SPEAKER_18]: There's my cell phone.

326
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,460
[SPEAKER_18]: Here, somebody talk.

327
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:54,621
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, I bet that's my... Oh, we're lost.

328
00:20:57,883 --> 00:21:02,926
[SPEAKER_28]: So anyway, we need to fill a little more time here.

329
00:21:03,046 --> 00:21:04,687
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's look at this profile, this one chick.

330
00:21:04,927 --> 00:21:10,411
[SPEAKER_28]: I guess the chick that makes a cameo in the beginning of Battle Royale 1 has a full part in the second movie.

331
00:21:10,431 --> 00:21:11,011
[SPEAKER_28]: That should be fun.

332
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:13,700
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, they are.

333
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,801
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, what the hell is this?

334
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:19,282
[SPEAKER_28]: There's some chick that looks like a Barbie doll that Chaz put in the chatroom.

335
00:21:20,022 --> 00:21:21,223
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, it looks like Christina Aguilera.

336
00:21:22,703 --> 00:21:23,403
[SPEAKER_28]: That's scary.

337
00:21:24,624 --> 00:21:24,924
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway.

338
00:21:25,664 --> 00:21:27,184
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, enough about Battle Royale.

339
00:21:27,405 --> 00:21:28,145
[SPEAKER_28]: Somebody wants to take the mic.

340
00:21:28,185 --> 00:21:28,385
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi.

341
00:21:28,405 --> 00:21:30,285
[SPEAKER_30]: You should have Dragon Ash in the next one.

342
00:21:33,026 --> 00:21:34,647
[SPEAKER_28]: So, how was your week, Loki?

343
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:35,007
[SPEAKER_28]: What'd you do?

344
00:21:35,737 --> 00:21:37,078
[SPEAKER_30]: I worked on the website.

345
00:21:37,138 --> 00:21:41,019
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, I know, there's nothing on there new right now.

346
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:44,540
[SPEAKER_30]: But trust me, tomorrow you're going to be seeing differently.

347
00:21:45,281 --> 00:21:47,381
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, I was busy downloading shit.

348
00:21:47,401 --> 00:21:51,683
[SPEAKER_30]: I was actually trying to organize all my sim files because now I'm up to 2446.

349
00:21:53,524 --> 00:22:01,387
[SPEAKER_30]: And I was just putting them in the official categories and CD tagging them and all that kind of stuff.

350
00:22:01,547 --> 00:22:01,847
[SPEAKER_30]: So...

351
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,881
[SPEAKER_30]: That's what I've been working on.

352
00:22:06,061 --> 00:22:12,565
[SPEAKER_30]: So there should be a huge update, and then I'll finally start doing more regular updates, but they'll be obviously much smaller than this.

353
00:22:13,906 --> 00:22:25,614
[SPEAKER_30]: But what will be coming up hopefully tomorrow, if I am able to zip everything up tonight, would be all the official sets for DDR, everything from first through extreme.

354
00:22:25,934 --> 00:22:27,475
[SPEAKER_30]: So everything that's done so far.

355
00:22:28,615 --> 00:22:28,756
[SPEAKER_28]: Nope.

356
00:22:28,776 --> 00:22:28,836
[SPEAKER_28]: God.

357
00:22:57,114 --> 00:23:26,250
[SPEAKER_30]: and a lot of times people just either make heavy steps or they'll just make basic steps and really annoying shit like that so you have to go back and fix them so that's what I'm hoping to do also with releasing files on my site is it'll allow me to go in and check these files and be able to fix them because you know obviously put them on the internet I want to make sure that they're nice and fixed they have nice backgrounds you know with artists named in the banners and all that wonderful stuff so that's what I'll be working on and

358
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:34,939
[SPEAKER_30]: You know, just to forewarn everyone, because obviously I'm sure people will be noticing this, all the sim files, you know, the official sets, are not created by me.

359
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:49,414
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, I know, shocker, I didn't have the time to create, thousands and thousands of sim files are already done, and already synced, so, you know, I'm just sticking them on my website in case some of these other websites go down, or it's just another place to find them, you know, bandwidth-wise or whatever.

360
00:23:51,047 --> 00:23:52,228
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, welcome back, DarkSakura.

361
00:23:52,408 --> 00:23:58,497
[SPEAKER_30]: But there will be some official stuff that will be exclusive to my site, such as the solo non-stops.

362
00:23:58,957 --> 00:24:03,824
[SPEAKER_30]: Those are going to be all done by me, and those are not anywhere to be found on the internet.

363
00:24:03,904 --> 00:24:05,085
[SPEAKER_27]: Very cool, very cool.

364
00:24:05,746 --> 00:24:06,286
[SPEAKER_30]: That's about it.

365
00:24:06,406 --> 00:24:14,011
[SPEAKER_30]: But if you're looking for DDR Extreme stuff and pretty much anything else right now, two sites you can look at would be Abomani Style.

366
00:24:14,211 --> 00:24:16,132
[SPEAKER_30]: They've got a lot of the stuff on there.

367
00:24:16,472 --> 00:24:24,837
[SPEAKER_30]: Or DDR UK, they've just opened their download section again to everyone instead of just level 2 members or whatever like that.

368
00:24:25,258 --> 00:24:26,738
[SPEAKER_30]: So you can go download everything.

369
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:35,182
[SPEAKER_30]: I swear by Lawrence on that site because he thinks files better than anyone.

370
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:44,766
[SPEAKER_30]: But I took his files and put the CD tags for Bomani, so I just like their CD tags better.

371
00:24:44,826 --> 00:24:45,206
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't know.

372
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:46,467
[SPEAKER_30]: This is picky, but.

373
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:51,074
[SPEAKER_30]: They're all up, or they will be all up tomorrow as soon as I upload them.

374
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,136
[SPEAKER_30]: And there's going to be a change with how you download them.

375
00:24:53,556 --> 00:24:57,138
[SPEAKER_30]: It's going to be all through FTP now instead of just through the website.

376
00:24:57,178 --> 00:24:59,600
[SPEAKER_30]: Because one, it'll allow me to update it faster.

377
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:05,764
[SPEAKER_30]: And two, the FTP's unregulated as far as bandwidth-wise and the website.

378
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,426
[SPEAKER_30]: Normally, you have unlimited bandwidth.

379
00:25:09,726 --> 00:25:13,867
[SPEAKER_30]: They do watch if your site uses a lot of bandwidth, they're going to close you down.

380
00:25:14,047 --> 00:25:19,109
[SPEAKER_30]: And unfortunately, my site is shared with Stepmania.com and a bunch of other ones.

381
00:25:19,489 --> 00:25:23,370
[SPEAKER_30]: So I don't want those going down, so I'm going to take measures to prevent that.

382
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,171
[SPEAKER_27]: Very cool.

383
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:27,211
[SPEAKER_27]: Question from the chat room.

384
00:25:27,231 --> 00:25:29,392
[SPEAKER_27]: Brack2000 wants to know, are you going to post announcer files?

385
00:25:31,233 --> 00:25:32,733
[SPEAKER_30]: No, actually, I could probably do that.

386
00:25:33,233 --> 00:25:33,753
[SPEAKER_30]: I have those.

387
00:25:34,434 --> 00:25:35,454
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, he wants them.

388
00:25:36,004 --> 00:25:37,465
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, maybe.

389
00:25:38,045 --> 00:25:38,886
[SPEAKER_30]: Maybe later this week.

390
00:25:39,006 --> 00:25:40,106
[SPEAKER_28]: What does it feel to want?

391
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:40,687
[SPEAKER_30]: I made a tower.

392
00:26:00,672 --> 00:26:01,193
[SPEAKER_28]: Another call?

393
00:26:02,013 --> 00:26:03,214
[SPEAKER_28]: People, turn your phones off!

394
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:04,435
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm just kidding.

395
00:26:04,675 --> 00:26:05,056
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm kidding.

396
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:07,218
[SPEAKER_18]: I had my phone off, but Mike would not know where we were.

397
00:26:07,498 --> 00:26:08,519
[SPEAKER_18]: Was Mike here?

398
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:09,199
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

399
00:26:09,439 --> 00:26:10,020
[SPEAKER_18]: But he's not here.

400
00:26:11,181 --> 00:26:12,102
[SPEAKER_28]: He got ice cream?

401
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:13,863
[SPEAKER_28]: Did he get me?

402
00:26:14,344 --> 00:26:15,244
[SPEAKER_28]: Did he get me ice cream?

403
00:26:15,625 --> 00:26:17,006
[SPEAKER_30]: Know what else I did this week?

404
00:26:17,026 --> 00:26:18,127
[SPEAKER_18]: We need something sweet.

405
00:26:19,443 --> 00:26:21,444
[SPEAKER_30]: I went and saw Dreamcatcher.

406
00:26:22,044 --> 00:26:22,625
[SPEAKER_22]: Was that any good?

407
00:26:23,065 --> 00:26:25,506
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, the final flight of Osiris was kick-ass.

408
00:26:25,886 --> 00:26:34,871
[SPEAKER_30]: Dreamcatcher, well, Dreamcatcher was a lot of fart jokes, bad acting, and a giant worm alien that speaks with a British accent.

409
00:26:38,109 --> 00:26:39,810
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't understand that at all.

410
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,871
[SPEAKER_28]: Good night, Angel.

411
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,472
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. Grey, he speaks to the British.

412
00:26:42,692 --> 00:26:47,435
[SPEAKER_30]: But it's hilarious, they've got one part in the movie, because obviously all the aliens look like these giant worm things.

413
00:26:47,915 --> 00:26:55,120
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, they make themselves look like, you know, the traditional looking alien, the grey humanoid thing with the weird eyes.

414
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:04,746
[SPEAKER_30]: So, basically there's one scene in the movie where they're going to destroy the alien ship, and you see all these aliens going, No, don't hurt us, we don't... What was it like, though?

415
00:27:05,026 --> 00:27:06,007
[SPEAKER_35]: We're not infected.

416
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:06,788
[SPEAKER_35]: Don't hurt us.

417
00:27:06,828 --> 00:27:07,609
[SPEAKER_35]: We're not... Right.

418
00:27:26,089 --> 00:27:29,673
[SPEAKER_30]: But yeah, Dreamcatcher, it was decent.

419
00:27:30,174 --> 00:27:31,235
[SPEAKER_30]: I wouldn't go see it again.

420
00:27:31,976 --> 00:27:34,519
[SPEAKER_30]: And, well, actually, it kind of sucked ass.

421
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:44,550
[SPEAKER_30]: But, next week, The Core comes out, and that is going to really suck ass, so don't go see that one.

422
00:27:47,006 --> 00:27:53,490
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, um, why don't we go to a quick break, I guess, unless, or is there any other sim news you want to talk about, Loki?

423
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:54,831
[SPEAKER_28]: Things going on in the sim world?

424
00:27:55,651 --> 00:28:01,695
[SPEAKER_30]: Uh, well, just, that made me as, you know, obviously the CS, watch for the CSV updates for that.

425
00:28:02,075 --> 00:28:07,058
[SPEAKER_30]: Last one they had was from the 6th, so it's a couple weeks old, but they're working on it.

426
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:16,023
[SPEAKER_30]: And Bomani sells, you know, if you're looking for, like, other sim file stuff, like, you know, for 2DX and that kind of thing, Bomani sells got some, uh, you know, Bomani,

427
00:28:16,424 --> 00:28:18,954
[SPEAKER_30]: They're really working on their Bomani

428
00:28:22,435 --> 00:28:23,656
[SPEAKER_30]: on their Bomani sim files.

429
00:28:23,676 --> 00:28:26,917
[SPEAKER_30]: They've got like a lot of 2DX stuff on there and Beatmania 3 and whatnot.

430
00:28:26,977 --> 00:28:33,101
[SPEAKER_30]: So check them out for everything else because they will have like one of the most complete sim file collections.

431
00:28:33,741 --> 00:28:39,004
[SPEAKER_30]: But DDRUK will probably have the best synced DDR DWIs.

432
00:28:39,104 --> 00:28:40,144
[SPEAKER_30]: So, I don't know.

433
00:28:41,085 --> 00:28:43,966
[SPEAKER_30]: Then of course there's my site which will have just a lot of shit.

434
00:28:44,126 --> 00:28:45,407
[SPEAKER_30]: A whole bunch of stuff on there.

435
00:28:46,668 --> 00:28:46,808
[SPEAKER_30]: So...

436
00:28:47,748 --> 00:28:48,248
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, cool.

437
00:28:48,468 --> 00:28:52,610
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to go to a break, and we'll be back in a little bit.

438
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:57,372
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to do this break, we'll do... I don't know, what song can we do?

439
00:28:58,133 --> 00:28:59,193
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's do something... Wait, wait, wait!

440
00:28:59,213 --> 00:28:59,353
[SPEAKER_10]: I know!

441
00:28:59,373 --> 00:28:59,493
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

442
00:29:00,033 --> 00:29:00,874
[SPEAKER_28]: Play my song.

443
00:29:01,214 --> 00:29:01,794
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, scary.

444
00:29:01,834 --> 00:29:04,055
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, we'll play something that Loki wants us to play.

445
00:29:06,336 --> 00:29:06,656
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

446
00:29:07,377 --> 00:29:07,557
[SPEAKER_30]: Here.

447
00:29:08,437 --> 00:29:10,078
[SPEAKER_28]: Da-da-da-da-da.

448
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:18,968
[SPEAKER_30]: We're loading up a really cool remix I just found on Monty Sims a while ago.

449
00:31:13,362 --> 00:31:16,589
[SPEAKER_32]: Kala kala kuta kuta kuta eh oh eh oh

450
00:33:21,762 --> 00:33:22,344
[SPEAKER_32]: Carameldansen

451
00:34:19,438 --> 00:34:21,862
[SPEAKER_10]: I am a taxi driver man I am a taxi driver man

454
00:36:08,412 --> 00:36:08,953
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello.

455
00:36:08,973 --> 00:36:09,933
[SPEAKER_18]: That woman is scary.

456
00:36:10,033 --> 00:36:10,594
[SPEAKER_18]: I saw her.

457
00:36:10,614 --> 00:36:11,294
[SPEAKER_18]: Who's scary?

458
00:36:11,695 --> 00:36:13,616
[SPEAKER_18]: The, um, the, uh, Ganguro.

459
00:36:13,776 --> 00:36:14,077
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

460
00:36:14,537 --> 00:36:15,978
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, the chick we were just looking at from Battle Royale 2?

461
00:36:16,018 --> 00:36:16,198
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

462
00:36:16,439 --> 00:36:16,959

00:36:19,861 --> 00:36:20,622
[SPEAKER_18]: She is scary.

469
00:36:20,642 --> 00:36:21,483
[SPEAKER_18]: She's gonna be in Battle Royale 2.

470
00:36:22,324 --> 00:36:23,524
[SPEAKER_28]: She looks like Christina Aguilera.

471
00:36:24,545 --> 00:36:28,186
[SPEAKER_18]: She's what's referred to as Ganguro.

472
00:36:30,347 --> 00:36:33,448
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, the super tan, the uber blonde in the panda makeup.

473
00:36:34,589 --> 00:36:34,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah.

474
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,071
[SPEAKER_18]: Which, from what I understand, are now a dying breed.

475
00:36:41,712 --> 00:36:41,972
[SPEAKER_10]: So.

476
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,212

00:36:43,232 --> 00:36:44,913

[SPEAKER_18]: Let's.

479
00:36:45,693 --> 00:36:46,673
[SPEAKER_18]: We got that to throw it, Rob.

480
00:36:48,914 --> 00:36:49,114
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh.

481
00:36:49,755 --> 00:36:49,995

[SPEAKER_28]: Doing alright.

[SPEAKER_28]: Could you possibly be here to promote anything tonight?

488
00:37:05,485 --> 00:37:06,265
[SPEAKER_28]: Is my microphone on?

489
00:37:06,365 --> 00:37:06,865
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I think it is.

490
00:37:06,885 --> 00:37:07,346
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, it is on.

491
00:37:07,766 --> 00:37:07,986
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

492
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:11,967
[SPEAKER_28]: Because if yours is off, then this one's off too, and that would be bad.

493
00:37:12,668 --> 00:37:15,389
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, so I'll turn it off.

494
00:37:18,855 --> 00:37:21,196

524
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:37,670
[SPEAKER_26]: It's been that long.

525
00:39:39,151 --> 00:39:42,532
[SPEAKER_26]: But back on topic, yeah, it costs $18,000 a play.

526
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:45,854
[SPEAKER_28]: Are you here promoting anything tonight, DJ Chow?

527
00:39:47,795 --> 00:39:51,176
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm promoting that right now I'm still, most of the way, single.

528
00:39:51,957 --> 00:39:53,998
[SPEAKER_20]: So, yeah, I'm promoting myself.

529
00:39:54,018 --> 00:39:54,418
[SPEAKER_20]: Most of the way?

00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,239

532
00:39:57,259 --> 00:39:59,900
[SPEAKER_20]: Her name's Susie, but there's nothing official yet, so I don't know.

533
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,981
[SPEAKER_20]: I think I'm still single.

534
00:40:02,779 --> 00:40:04,219
[SPEAKER_28]: So if you want to come on down to March Madness.

535
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:06,860
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

536
00:40:09,461 --> 00:40:11,701
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright, there's a tournament coming up, March Madness.

537
00:40:13,441 --> 00:40:16,902
[SPEAKER_26]: If any of you watch NCAA college basketball, you already know the format.

538
00:40:17,522 --> 00:40:18,903
[SPEAKER_26]: If not, let me break it down for you.

539
00:40:19,743 --> 00:40:23,744
[SPEAKER_26]: It's like the WWF, 64 Hell in a Cell match.

540
00:40:24,044 --> 00:40:24,624
[SPEAKER_26]: No, not really.

541
00:40:25,184 --> 00:40:27,625
[SPEAKER_26]: It's going to be 64 people, all in bracketed play.

542
00:40:29,465 --> 00:40:33,227
[SPEAKER_26]: and basically you score off head to head against each other.

543
00:40:33,327 --> 00:40:35,448
[SPEAKER_26]: You will be seeded like the NCAA tournament.

544
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:42,731
[SPEAKER_26]: So basically if you're from SoCal and NorCal or any other state, we're going to try to keep you guys separate from one another.

545
00:40:44,511 --> 00:40:48,753
[SPEAKER_26]: We're basically going to take your abilities and we're going to rank you accordingly.

546
00:40:50,994 --> 00:40:53,515
[SPEAKER_26]: and every match will be one song only.

547
00:40:54,135 --> 00:40:56,615
[SPEAKER_26]: And the person with more perfects will advance to the next round.

548
00:40:57,415 --> 00:41:02,697
[SPEAKER_26]: And the winner must win six grueling matches because I will make it especially tough for you.

549
00:41:05,317 --> 00:41:08,838
[SPEAKER_26]: As a hint, I guess I'll... Okay, there's 64 matches.

550
00:41:08,998 --> 00:41:11,618
[SPEAKER_26]: I will tell you one song in the tournament you guys should practice.

551
00:41:12,419 --> 00:41:13,199
[SPEAKER_26]: Practice bag.

552
00:41:15,299 --> 00:41:15,759
[SPEAKER_28]: Tee hee.

553
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,600
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I hate that song.

554
00:41:21,363 --> 00:41:21,644
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

555
00:41:22,124 --> 00:41:23,507
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm being told about freestyle.

556
00:41:23,527 --> 00:41:24,989
[SPEAKER_28]: You want to talk about freestyle?

557
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:25,650
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

558
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,932
[SPEAKER_28]: The way freestyle's going to go down?

559
00:41:28,054 --> 00:41:28,675
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

560
00:41:28,795 --> 00:41:30,658
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm also taking freestyle to a new level.

561
00:41:30,858 --> 00:41:33,162
[SPEAKER_26]: I want to get some reality DDR going.

562
00:41:34,156 --> 00:41:37,159
[SPEAKER_26]: So we're basing it off American Idol with DDR Idol.

563
00:41:39,261 --> 00:41:43,345
[SPEAKER_26]: I haven't released this yet, but I will tell you guys the judges now since we're only one week away.

564
00:41:43,605 --> 00:41:44,766
[SPEAKER_26]: Ooh, okay, let's hear it.

565
00:41:45,527 --> 00:41:49,150
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright, of course you guys all know Simon, Paula, and Randy.

00:41:52,213 --> 00:41:54,435
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll start with... Randy.

00:41:55,536 --> 00:42:04,961
[SPEAKER_26]: He is someone that has the GDR credentials, he's someone that has won tournaments, and he's someone that uses dog in every sentence.

569
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:13,385
[SPEAKER_28]: So, we can't go wrong, it's Mel B. Oh, yes, wait, wait, I think we might have a little clip of Mel B here somewhere.

570
00:42:15,026 --> 00:42:16,326
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, this is Mel B of our team.

571
00:42:16,346 --> 00:42:17,127
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, there we go.

572
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:18,910
[SPEAKER_28]: That's right.

573
00:42:19,651 --> 00:42:20,212
[SPEAKER_26]: That's right.

574
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:23,815
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright, on to Paula.

575
00:42:24,135 --> 00:42:25,856
[SPEAKER_26]: Some of you might know her, some of you might not.

576
00:42:26,837 --> 00:42:28,278
[SPEAKER_26]: She's a SoCal DDR player.

577
00:42:28,459 --> 00:42:29,299
[SPEAKER_26]: I know Paula Abdul.

578
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,441
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

579
00:42:32,642 --> 00:42:34,584
[SPEAKER_26]: She also goes by the handle...

[SPEAKER_26]: She also goes by the handle GoodAttackGirl Her name is Angela Is she sweet?

581
00:42:39,983 --> 00:42:50,835
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, she is Okay That's all that's important Yeah She'll try to keep Simon in check Alright, good Alright, many of you have been wondering Who is Simon gonna be?

582
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:55,900
[SPEAKER_28]: Many people have wanted to be Simon, including our own Loki kept begging.

583
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,421
[SPEAKER_28]: We got people in the chatroom begging.

584
00:42:58,141 --> 00:42:59,861
[SPEAKER_28]: But it's already been sealed, right?

585
00:42:59,881 --> 00:43:01,442
[SPEAKER_28]: The deal's been sealed a long time ago, right?

586
00:43:01,622 --> 00:43:01,822
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

587
00:43:02,022 --> 00:43:03,542
[SPEAKER_28]: You signed a deal with the devil.

588
00:43:03,642 --> 00:43:07,544
[SPEAKER_26]: Basically, before the tournament even started, I secured my Simon.

589
00:43:08,284 --> 00:43:11,625
[SPEAKER_26]: Because if I would have gotten this person a Simon, I think this tournament would have been on hold.

590
00:43:13,486 --> 00:43:17,388
[SPEAKER_26]: This is someone that won't be afraid to tell you to your face that you suck shit.

591
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:22,872
[SPEAKER_26]: He'll tell you to your face that he'll never want to see you on the DDR platform ever again.

592
00:43:24,314 --> 00:43:29,878
[SPEAKER_26]: This person will also tell you not to ever put a quarter in the machine.

593
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:31,939
[SPEAKER_26]: He'll tell you that you're ugly.

594
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,521
[SPEAKER_26]: He'll tell you that your routine was ugly.

595
00:43:35,382 --> 00:43:36,562
[SPEAKER_26]: He'll tell you you can't dance.

596
00:43:37,543 --> 00:43:39,825
[SPEAKER_26]: He'll tell you you're the worst dancer in America.

597
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:45,924
[SPEAKER_26]: He might even tell you he might be the worst DDR player in the world, or even the universe.

598
00:43:48,426 --> 00:43:51,048
[SPEAKER_26]: But I don't think I'll tell you guys, because I want to keep the suspense for a week.

599
00:43:52,269 --> 00:43:52,789
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, come on.

600
00:43:53,169 --> 00:43:53,610

603
00:43:58,473 --> 00:44:01,456
[SPEAKER_26]: He's none other than... Josh.

604
00:44:01,896 --> 00:44:02,416
[SPEAKER_26]: Failure.

605
00:44:02,737 --> 00:44:04,898
[SPEAKER_26]: Be afraid.

606
00:44:05,299 --> 00:44:06,640
[SPEAKER_24]: Be very afraid.

607
00:44:09,289 --> 00:44:09,890
[SPEAKER_24]: That will be fun.

608
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:12,171
[SPEAKER_18]: Hide your egos.

609
00:44:15,733 --> 00:44:18,775
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, so that should be interesting.

610
00:44:18,835 --> 00:44:19,976
[SPEAKER_28]: Sounds like a good group of judges.

611
00:44:20,036 --> 00:44:24,198
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, are you going to be announcing America or is that a wait until the next week?

612
00:44:25,077 --> 00:44:27,337
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, so we don't give away everything.

613
00:44:27,377 --> 00:44:28,898
[SPEAKER_26]: We're not going to have America announced.

614
00:44:29,298 --> 00:44:29,818
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, okay.

615
00:44:30,578 --> 00:44:31,118
[SPEAKER_26]: Sounds fair enough.

616
00:44:31,698 --> 00:44:36,379
[SPEAKER_26]: And also, um, just to let you know, Ryan Seacrest, uh, we're going to have two co-hosts.

617
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:38,559
[SPEAKER_26]: So you got Dunkleman back.

618
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,900
Yeah.

619
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,680
[SPEAKER_26]: We're going to have two co-hosts, so it's going to be fun.

620
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:44,700
[SPEAKER_22]: Definitely fun.

621
00:44:45,781 --> 00:44:46,121
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

622
00:44:46,841 --> 00:44:48,901
[SPEAKER_22]: You going to talk about who that is, or is that a surprise to you?

623
00:44:50,381 --> 00:44:52,602
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's better if you find out next week.

624
00:44:52,642 --> 00:44:53,482
[SPEAKER_22]: Many surprises.

625
00:44:55,054 --> 00:44:56,015
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, you have to come to figure it out.

626
00:44:56,055 --> 00:45:03,420
[SPEAKER_28]: Or if you're too far away, like if you're on the East Coast and something can't make it out here, you have to tune in live because we'll be broadcasting it live and you'll find all that out because we'll tell you.

627
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,223
[SPEAKER_18]: I think all those people on the East Coast should just, you know, bite the bullet and get a plane ticket.

628
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:13,727
[SPEAKER_18]: Ride the Amtrak, use a Greyhound, hitchhike, sell yourself to be at this tournament.

629
00:45:15,308 --> 00:45:19,331
[SPEAKER_30]: And don't worry, Sacramento doesn't really have any large skyscrapers, so you're still good.

630
00:45:21,112 --> 00:45:21,913
[SPEAKER_18]: Folsom has a dam.

631
00:45:23,959 --> 00:45:25,160
[SPEAKER_26]: What about nuclear power plants?

632
00:45:26,281 --> 00:45:28,002
[SPEAKER_28]: They shut down Rancho Sego years ago, right?

633
00:45:29,804 --> 00:45:31,485
[SPEAKER_20]: What about all the Air Force bases we have here?

634
00:45:31,765 --> 00:45:31,945
[SPEAKER_20]: Shh!

635
00:45:34,327 --> 00:45:36,389
[SPEAKER_28]: They all keep getting bought out and privatized.

636
00:45:39,051 --> 00:45:39,271
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

637
00:45:40,072 --> 00:45:43,695
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, so, any other things about March Madness we gotta talk about?

638
00:45:44,035 --> 00:45:45,256
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my god, oh my god, we should bomb RBGL.

639
00:45:45,296 --> 00:45:45,776
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my god.

640
00:45:47,335 --> 00:45:48,756
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, that's the only thing you have to worry about.

641
00:45:49,076 --> 00:45:49,857
[SPEAKER_26]: I second that notion.

642
00:45:50,197 --> 00:45:59,724
[SPEAKER_26]: But I will have to say, this is one of the tournaments that you actually want to participate in because last year was so much fun.

643
00:46:01,405 --> 00:46:07,809
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, going through the 64 people and 32 matches, who really gives a shit about the 7-10 matchup, right?

644
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:11,952
[SPEAKER_26]: So it ended up being one of the most exciting matches in the first round.

645
00:46:11,992 --> 00:46:15,194
[SPEAKER_26]: Hyperbroken versus Liquid Blue.

646
00:46:15,914 --> 00:46:23,799
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just a little blast from the past, but what happened was Hyperbroken was the number 10 seed, Liquid Blue was the 7th seed.

647
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,782
[SPEAKER_26]: And Liquid Blue was lucky enough to get his song, La Señorita.

648
00:46:29,782 --> 00:46:34,285
[SPEAKER_26]: But Hyperbroken won by one great, and everyone in the building was chanting Upset.

649
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:35,466
[SPEAKER_26]: Upset.

650
00:46:38,058 --> 00:46:41,559
[SPEAKER_26]: and who couldn't forget Chubbs taking out the number one, Enoan.

651
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:45,461
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, I think this year there's going to be much more upsets.

652
00:46:47,061 --> 00:46:50,762
[SPEAKER_26]: The way it's structured, one win all the way throughout, so nothing is guaranteed.

653
00:46:50,842 --> 00:46:53,003
[SPEAKER_26]: You can get your song and run the table.

654
00:46:54,063 --> 00:46:56,944
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyways, you want to say anything, DarkShark?

655
00:46:58,425 --> 00:46:58,765
[SPEAKER_26]: Nah.

656
00:46:59,545 --> 00:47:01,746
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm wondering if we're going to have our great white ninja.

657
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:04,061
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know.

658
00:47:04,842 --> 00:47:06,684
[SPEAKER_26]: The Great White Ninja's in Wisconsin right now.

659
00:47:06,984 --> 00:47:09,686
[SPEAKER_26]: It's kind of hard to get a ninja, you know, magically appear here.

660
00:47:10,106 --> 00:47:20,755
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, I have been asked to let it be known to the Asian innovation that the Caucasian innovation, 23rd Magus, will do a max unlimited routine with DDR Idol.

661
00:47:24,438 --> 00:47:27,261
[SPEAKER_26]: Be prepared to have your statements on videotape.

662
00:47:29,262 --> 00:47:29,883
[SPEAKER_26]: Let it be known.

663
00:47:32,572 --> 00:47:42,916
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright, by the way, we will be producing a DVD eventually with this tournament, so if you guys miss it, you will be able to relive all the moments again with commentary.

664
00:47:45,797 --> 00:47:47,338
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm on DVD, sweet.

665
00:47:48,878 --> 00:47:50,579
[SPEAKER_26]: Trust me, this will be just like Jackass.

666
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,281
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey, could my double trick paranoia routine be a special feature?

667
00:47:57,216 --> 00:47:58,197
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, baby, yeah.

668
00:47:59,437 --> 00:47:59,718
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, yeah.

669
00:48:00,058 --> 00:48:01,038
[SPEAKER_26]: This is how Dick Vitale does it.

670
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:02,319
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, baby, yeah!

671
00:48:02,399 --> 00:48:03,320
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe we should get the bats.

672
00:48:06,001 --> 00:48:09,023
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, maybe Jamie and I will do a reprise of our middle two routine.

673
00:48:09,504 --> 00:48:09,964
[SPEAKER_28]: That'll be fun.

674
00:48:10,684 --> 00:48:12,946
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm actually half-tempted to auction off my orange pad on Sunday.

675
00:48:14,127 --> 00:48:14,947
[SPEAKER_28]: Nice, nice.

676
00:48:15,567 --> 00:48:17,048
[SPEAKER_18]: Auction the bat for charity or something.

677
00:48:18,609 --> 00:48:19,630
[SPEAKER_18]: All five cents it's worth.

678
00:48:20,598 --> 00:48:21,018
[SPEAKER_28]: Fried Twinkies

679
00:48:39,381 --> 00:48:45,084
[SPEAKER_28]: One very cool thing that's going to be run on the side of March Madness is a 2DX tournament.

680
00:48:46,265 --> 00:48:50,908
[SPEAKER_28]: I believe, am I not correct, this is NorCal's first big 2DX tournament, correct?

681
00:48:51,568 --> 00:48:52,309
[SPEAKER_26]: I think so, yeah.

682
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:52,749
[SPEAKER_28]: I think so.

683
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:57,952
[SPEAKER_28]: So the very first 2DX tournament will be this weekend.

684
00:48:58,332 --> 00:48:58,932
[SPEAKER_28]: And guess what?

685
00:48:59,252 --> 00:49:03,035
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to announce the qualifying songs here live, but we'll do that after the FUs.

686
00:49:03,775 --> 00:49:04,355
[SPEAKER_28]: You want to do it right now?

687
00:49:05,256 --> 00:49:05,636
[SPEAKER_28]: Right now?

688
00:49:06,396 --> 00:49:07,296
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, let's talk about it.

689
00:49:07,976 --> 00:49:16,119
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, what's funny about this, only like four people in the whole world know about the 2DX qualifiers right now.

690
00:49:16,419 --> 00:49:17,219
[SPEAKER_28]: Mike doesn't even know.

691
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:22,961
[SPEAKER_28]: It's his dang tournament, the March Madness, but he doesn't know.

692
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,662
[SPEAKER_28]: But you're going to be competing in 2DX, right?

693
00:49:24,922 --> 00:49:25,442
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, I will.

694
00:49:25,702 --> 00:49:28,743
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, so it would be good to get some reactions from some contestants here live on air.

695
00:49:28,783 --> 00:49:31,324
[SPEAKER_28]: So let's talk about what those qualifiers are going to be.

696
00:49:34,918 --> 00:49:35,660
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, here we go.

697
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,664
[SPEAKER_28]: I've got to bring them up, so fill time.

698
00:49:38,386 --> 00:49:40,110
[SPEAKER_28]: Tell us more about how the 2DX tournament will work, Jamie.

699
00:49:42,135 --> 00:49:48,340
[SPEAKER_18]: You hit the keys, turn the slidey thing, and you make a song.

700
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:49,921
[SPEAKER_18]: That's how 2DX works.

701
00:49:50,421 --> 00:49:54,824
[SPEAKER_18]: Really, the way it's going to work is qualifiers are going to have two songs that they have to play.

702
00:49:54,905 --> 00:49:56,686
[SPEAKER_18]: Higher score moves on, basically.

703
00:49:57,907 --> 00:49:59,208
[SPEAKER_18]: And the rest of it's going to go like that.

704
00:49:59,248 --> 00:50:05,372
[SPEAKER_18]: However, for anyone who went to Shaft, the rest of the tournament is going to work very much like Shaft worked, where we have the categories with the songs.

705
00:50:05,893 --> 00:50:07,114
[SPEAKER_18]: And the categories, by the way...

706
00:50:08,357 --> 00:50:10,378
[SPEAKER_18]: In our minds, they're associated with the songs.

707
00:50:10,418 --> 00:50:12,418
[SPEAKER_18]: They may not necessarily be that way in your mind.

708
00:50:13,499 --> 00:50:15,999
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's going to be challenging.

709
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:16,860
[SPEAKER_18]: We can put it that way.

710
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:17,620
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to be challenging.

711
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:25,562
[SPEAKER_18]: But it'll be a fun tournament, and I don't think anyone's going to walk away from that being really unsatisfied.

712
00:50:26,702 --> 00:50:28,683
[SPEAKER_26]: Unless you start with the qualifiers with V and other.

713
00:50:29,783 --> 00:50:31,364
[SPEAKER_18]: We're not going to go that hard.

714
00:50:31,924 --> 00:50:32,024
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

715
00:50:34,429 --> 00:50:35,929
[SPEAKER_18]: It might get harder though in the later rounds.

716
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:37,690
[SPEAKER_18]: Definitely would get harder in the later rounds.

717
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:43,671
[SPEAKER_10]: But we're not going to say anything about that.

718
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:46,132
[SPEAKER_18]: What about squeezing crotch?

719
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:47,653
[SPEAKER_20]: Dude, this ferret.

720
00:50:47,713 --> 00:50:48,793
[SPEAKER_20]: These noises he's making.

721
00:50:49,113 --> 00:50:51,574
[SPEAKER_20]: You have to squeeze his crotch to make these noises.

722
00:50:52,354 --> 00:50:55,015
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd be making noises if someone squeezed my crotch.

723
00:50:58,196 --> 00:50:59,916
[SPEAKER_18]: Last week on Orange Lounge.

724
00:51:00,637 --> 00:51:01,757
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't do those anymore, you know?

725
00:51:02,941 --> 00:51:04,981
[SPEAKER_28]: I got lazy, so I stopped doing those flashback clicks.

726
00:51:05,241 --> 00:51:07,342
[SPEAKER_28]: And yes, we will be announcing qualifiers here in just a second.

727
00:51:07,362 --> 00:51:08,342
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm just killing some stuff up.

728
00:51:09,902 --> 00:51:11,503
[SPEAKER_30]: I'll do them when we get in our new place.

729
00:51:12,363 --> 00:51:13,063
[SPEAKER_30]: I'll make them evil.

730
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:14,763
[SPEAKER_26]: And we're sponsored by Pringles.

731
00:51:14,803 --> 00:51:15,183
[SPEAKER_18]: God.

732
00:51:15,983 --> 00:51:20,464
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sponsored by Propel and the letter Z. Yeah.

733
00:51:20,784 --> 00:51:22,084
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought that was what they said about sex.

734
00:51:22,164 --> 00:51:25,685
[SPEAKER_26]: No, once you pop it.

735
00:51:26,425 --> 00:51:27,305
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, you don't stop it.

736
00:51:28,806 --> 00:51:30,406
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, too bad these Pringles taste like shit.

737
00:51:32,251 --> 00:51:35,232
[SPEAKER_26]: Actually, sex tastes like shit too, depending on what kind you do.

738
00:51:36,432 --> 00:51:38,072
[SPEAKER_20]: Dude, I don't know who you're having sex with.

739
00:51:38,132 --> 00:51:39,172
[SPEAKER_20]: It shouldn't taste like that.

740
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:48,794
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, it depends on how you... Wrong end.

741
00:51:49,574 --> 00:51:52,635
[SPEAKER_30]: That was a cartoon too.

742
00:51:55,155 --> 00:51:57,756
[SPEAKER_26]: We have an unpaid sponsor now, www.rotten.com

743
00:52:00,849 --> 00:52:09,737
[SPEAKER_19]: www.styleproject.com That's S-T-I-L-E styleproject.com Alright, you guys ready to hear those qualifiers for 2DX?

744
00:52:09,977 --> 00:52:10,217
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

745
00:52:10,478 --> 00:52:10,758
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

746
00:52:11,439 --> 00:52:14,922
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, as you know, or may not know, the 2DX qualifiers are in pairs.

747
00:52:15,282 --> 00:52:18,965
[SPEAKER_28]: So you have to play two songs, and you can't pick two songs on the list.

748
00:52:19,025 --> 00:52:21,087
[SPEAKER_28]: Each song has a partner song that must be played with it.

749
00:52:21,487 --> 00:52:21,948
[SPEAKER_28]: So here it is.

750
00:52:22,488 --> 00:52:25,191
[SPEAKER_28]: The first pair of qualifiers is Deadline.

751
00:52:25,311 --> 00:52:26,131
[SPEAKER_28]: Fucking shit!

752
00:52:26,472 --> 00:52:26,552
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh.

753
00:52:29,144 --> 00:52:33,055
[SPEAKER_28]: Followed by, oh I should say Deadline 7 Key, followed by the Safari, Light 7

754
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:42,826
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, it's the first pair, Deadline and Safari Light 7.

755
00:52:42,866 --> 00:52:47,550
[SPEAKER_28]: The second pair that you can pick from is Airflow, 7Key.

756
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:49,232
[SPEAKER_28]: That song sucks.

757
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:53,916
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry, I pulled these really quickly.

758
00:52:54,196 --> 00:52:57,939
[SPEAKER_28]: And the partner song to that is Kochiwo Muteo from 6Style.

759
00:53:01,508 --> 00:53:03,349
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, I know I'm not going to be picking that pair.

760
00:53:05,889 --> 00:53:06,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Just shoot me.

761
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:10,310
[SPEAKER_28]: Third pair that you can pick from.

762
00:53:10,891 --> 00:53:11,751
[SPEAKER_28]: This is the third pair.

763
00:53:11,811 --> 00:53:12,731
[SPEAKER_28]: It's Cheer Train.

764
00:53:13,391 --> 00:53:14,672
[SPEAKER_28]: What the hell is Cheer Train?

765
00:53:18,753 --> 00:53:19,593
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

766
00:53:22,054 --> 00:53:23,394
[SPEAKER_28]: And that's partnered with Abyss.

767
00:53:32,731 --> 00:53:59,720
[SPEAKER_28]: And the third pair is Indigo Vision And that's partnered with Spooky And the last pair is Alien World Well, that's an easy one, but it's partnered with Rizlem

768
00:54:05,462 --> 00:54:06,323
[SPEAKER_28]: All these suck.

769
00:54:06,824 --> 00:54:09,988
[SPEAKER_28]: So... So there they are.

770
00:54:10,609 --> 00:54:12,672
[SPEAKER_28]: Those are the qualifying songs for the 2DX tournament.

771
00:54:12,692 --> 00:54:13,993
[SPEAKER_28]: What the fuck is Cheer Train?

772
00:54:15,075 --> 00:54:16,216
[SPEAKER_28]: You want to hear Cheer Train one more time?

773
00:54:16,297 --> 00:54:18,039
[SPEAKER_28]: Wasn't that a side quest of Final Fantasy VIII?

774
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:19,120
[SPEAKER_28]: No, it's from VII Style.

775
00:54:23,195 --> 00:54:26,757
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll play some of those during the breaks, so you can get refreshed with those songs.

776
00:54:27,217 --> 00:54:29,178
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, songs were kind of picked on purpose.

777
00:54:29,538 --> 00:54:31,739
[SPEAKER_28]: Half songs people play and half people don't play.

778
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,100
[SPEAKER_28]: Let me run down those one more time.

779
00:54:34,581 --> 00:54:38,202
[SPEAKER_28]: These are the pairs you can pick from to qualify with for the 2DX Tournament of March Madness.

780
00:54:38,242 --> 00:54:41,324
[SPEAKER_28]: First pair, Deadline, 7Key, and Safari, Light 7.

781
00:54:42,304 --> 00:54:45,946
[SPEAKER_28]: Second pair is Airflow, and pronounce that for me because I'm too white.

782
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:47,487
[SPEAKER_18]: Where?

783
00:54:47,507 --> 00:54:47,687
[SPEAKER_18]: Where?

784
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:55,825
[SPEAKER_28]: and the third set is Cheer Train and Abyss.

785
00:54:56,465 --> 00:54:57,346
[SPEAKER_28]: It's both seven key.

786
00:54:57,366 --> 00:55:02,230
[SPEAKER_28]: The fourth pair is Indigo Vision and Spooky, both seven key.

787
00:55:02,731 --> 00:55:03,311
[SPEAKER_24]: Four key!

788
00:55:03,531 --> 00:55:04,993
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, I love this tournament already!

789
00:55:06,274 --> 00:55:10,117
[SPEAKER_28]: And the fifth pair is Alien World and Rizlem, seven key.

790
00:55:10,657 --> 00:55:11,118
[SPEAKER_28]: So there you go.

791
00:55:11,818 --> 00:55:15,662
[SPEAKER_28]: Now you can start practicing and picking which pair you think is the best one.

792
00:55:15,962 --> 00:55:17,103
[SPEAKER_26]: These choices suck.

793
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:18,985
[SPEAKER_26]: Literally, they suck.

794
00:55:19,645 --> 00:55:20,466
[SPEAKER_26]: These songs suck.

795
00:55:22,608 --> 00:55:23,409
[SPEAKER_26]: I already know what I'm doing.

796
00:55:23,449 --> 00:55:25,231
[SPEAKER_26]: We're going by expert score, so I already know what I'm doing.

797
00:55:26,272 --> 00:55:26,552
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright.

798
00:55:28,354 --> 00:55:29,655
[SPEAKER_26]: I think I'm not entering this song.

799
00:55:29,675 --> 00:55:30,937
[SPEAKER_18]: I can pass half of those songs.

800
00:55:31,457 --> 00:55:32,979
[SPEAKER_18]: And the other half I can't.

801
00:55:32,999 --> 00:55:33,940
[SPEAKER_18]: Which one's the one with your train?

802
00:55:34,861 --> 00:55:35,261
[SPEAKER_18]: Abyss.

803
00:55:35,862 --> 00:55:37,984
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I failed Abyss with like a vengeance today.

804
00:55:38,004 --> 00:55:38,785
[SPEAKER_18]: I got a 12 on it.

805
00:55:42,269 --> 00:55:42,969
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, so...

806
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:44,727
[SPEAKER_28]: Hooray for that.

807
00:55:46,888 --> 00:55:53,872
[SPEAKER_28]: As promised during this segment, we would get to the FUs of the week, so if we're done talking about March Madness now... You guys done?

808
00:55:54,672 --> 00:55:56,013
[SPEAKER_28]: Is there anything else we need to say about March Madness?

809
00:55:58,774 --> 00:56:09,880
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, well let's do... Let's do the FUs of the week, and you know, since Asian Innovation and Dark Child have never been here for the FUs of the week, Jamie, you wanted to explain to them how it works.

810
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:11,981
[SPEAKER_18]: Busy opening my Propel, fuck you.

811
00:56:12,641 --> 00:56:13,182
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, oh wait.

812
00:56:13,722 --> 00:56:13,762
[SPEAKER_18]: Um...

813
00:56:14,768 --> 00:56:15,649
[SPEAKER_18]: That is exactly it.

814
00:56:16,369 --> 00:56:19,171
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck yous of the week are where you talk about shit you're pissed off about.

815
00:56:20,471 --> 00:56:20,871
[SPEAKER_18]: That's it.

816
00:56:22,052 --> 00:56:25,574
[SPEAKER_18]: Anything that you want to give a fuck you to, just tell them right now on the air.

817
00:56:25,614 --> 00:56:26,875
[SPEAKER_18]: They may not be listening, but oh well.

818
00:56:26,895 --> 00:56:27,955
[SPEAKER_18]: It feels better to get it out.

819
00:56:29,016 --> 00:56:32,258
[SPEAKER_26]: I fucking hate the fucking gas prices fucking going on fucking right now.

820
00:56:32,338 --> 00:56:33,198
[SPEAKER_26]: You gotta wait your turn.

821
00:56:33,899 --> 00:56:34,619
[SPEAKER_26]: You gotta wait your turn.

822
00:56:34,739 --> 00:56:35,119
[SPEAKER_26]: Fuck!

823
00:56:37,801 --> 00:56:41,583
[SPEAKER_28]: So, with that being said, let's get started, shall we, Jamie?

824
00:56:48,922 --> 00:56:50,123
[SPEAKER_08]: This is fucked up!

825
00:56:51,164 --> 00:56:53,186
[SPEAKER_18]: My first fuck you of the week goes for being unemployed.

826
00:56:54,287 --> 00:57:05,217
[SPEAKER_18]: But also being unemployed is a good thing because my life is much more enjoyable since I can go wake up at 2 in the afternoon and go to Scandia, play 2DX for three hours and then go back home and sleep.

827
00:57:06,238 --> 00:57:10,502
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, fuck you to my car still not being tuned up, although they're doing everything they can.

828
00:57:10,623 --> 00:57:12,024
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm being patient about it.

829
00:57:13,485 --> 00:57:13,986
[SPEAKER_18]: But, um...

830
00:57:15,334 --> 00:57:16,615
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just been a while, okay?

831
00:57:16,655 --> 00:57:18,295
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just been a while.

832
00:57:18,876 --> 00:57:20,877
[SPEAKER_18]: Also goes for people who can't drive.

833
00:57:21,517 --> 00:57:26,459
[SPEAKER_18]: And goes toward the particular exit from the Boston Market parking lot.

834
00:57:27,139 --> 00:57:28,940
[SPEAKER_18]: And for the woman who looked like a troll.

835
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:29,761
[SPEAKER_18]: You remember her?

836
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:36,223
[SPEAKER_18]: The woman in the white car who I seriously thought... You've seen that movie Troll, right?

837
00:57:37,364 --> 00:57:39,125
[SPEAKER_18]: She looked like Troll.

838
00:57:39,285 --> 00:57:40,665
[SPEAKER_18]: Except she was not great.

839
00:57:41,306 --> 00:57:41,366
[SPEAKER_18]: Um...

840
00:57:42,569 --> 00:57:43,630
[SPEAKER_29]: She was going to live under a bridge.

841
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:45,372
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, she was driving to a bridge.

842
00:57:47,414 --> 00:57:56,542
[SPEAKER_18]: And then my other fuck you goes toward not being able to think of anything else to say fuck you to.

843
00:57:57,002 --> 00:57:59,444
[SPEAKER_18]: I wasn't going to say it.

844
00:58:00,505 --> 00:58:01,026
[SPEAKER_18]: Hire me.

845
00:58:01,747 --> 00:58:02,087
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

846
00:58:10,171 --> 00:58:12,352
[SPEAKER_30]: There's a big, huge, like, knot in the cord here.

847
00:58:12,432 --> 00:58:14,932
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, we're talking, like, massive knot here.

848
00:58:17,533 --> 00:58:19,373
[SPEAKER_30]: That's a big, huge knot.

849
00:58:20,093 --> 00:58:22,214
[SPEAKER_30]: FU to Rob for keeping his cords all knotted.

850
00:58:22,254 --> 00:58:25,034
[SPEAKER_30]: Of course, I can't really say much about that because you should see it on my computer.

851
00:58:25,054 --> 00:58:27,055
[SPEAKER_30]: It's like a giant, massive cord.

852
00:58:28,095 --> 00:58:29,776
[SPEAKER_30]: Anyways, um, let's see.

853
00:58:29,996 --> 00:58:30,776
[SPEAKER_30]: I know I had... Oh, yeah!

854
00:58:32,905 --> 00:58:37,689
[SPEAKER_30]: F you to McDonald's for putting their freaking condiments and everything under the cheese.

855
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:45,756
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't like pickles on my fucking cheeseburgers if I ever ask for them to take them off because that takes extra time and they're slow as it is.

856
00:58:46,257 --> 00:58:54,104
[SPEAKER_30]: So this dumb bitch puts the fucking pickles underneath the cheese where you cannot get at the pickles because they're under the cheese and melted over, you know.

857
00:58:54,704 --> 00:58:57,347
[SPEAKER_30]: So it pissed me off because I was biting into the hamburger.

858
00:58:57,387 --> 00:58:59,849
[SPEAKER_30]: First I looked at it and go, oh look, no pickles on this.

859
00:59:00,189 --> 00:59:01,210
[SPEAKER_30]: and they didn't put any condiments.

860
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:04,211
[SPEAKER_30]: I bite into it, taste pickle, and then get pissed.

861
00:59:04,231 --> 00:59:07,512
[SPEAKER_30]: So, you're so stupid, you can't even... You fucked up a burger!

862
00:59:07,872 --> 00:59:08,813
[SPEAKER_30]: How easy is that?

863
00:59:09,493 --> 00:59:10,333
[SPEAKER_30]: Fucking a burger?

864
00:59:11,094 --> 00:59:11,954
[SPEAKER_30]: Put this shit together.

865
00:59:13,054 --> 00:59:14,315
[SPEAKER_20]: You're fucking a burger?

866
00:59:15,355 --> 00:59:16,356
[SPEAKER_30]: They're fucking a burger.

867
00:59:16,776 --> 00:59:17,917
[SPEAKER_30]: They're fucking up a burger.

868
00:59:18,697 --> 00:59:19,557
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, that explains a lot.

869
00:59:19,577 --> 00:59:20,478
[SPEAKER_30]: What the hell?

870
00:59:20,978 --> 00:59:24,519
[SPEAKER_18]: You weren't complaining, I fixed it.

871
00:59:24,619 --> 00:59:27,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, anyways.

872
00:59:27,841 --> 00:59:27,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

873
00:59:33,473 --> 00:59:34,033
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't know that much.

874
00:59:34,053 --> 00:59:35,554
[SPEAKER_26]: Fuck you to microphones that aren't low.

875
00:59:35,574 --> 00:59:42,177
[SPEAKER_30]: F you to my stupid, your remix, DarkSakura, that's not coming along because it's just, I don't know, not good.

876
00:59:43,297 --> 00:59:47,299
[SPEAKER_30]: F you to me for having a headache and I don't know where it's coming from.

877
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,481
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't know.

878
00:59:51,621 --> 01:00:00,426
[SPEAKER_30]: Damn, you know, it sucks because I was really angsty earlier this morning, but then after hearing that Miyazaki screwed way one, I just kind of forgot about everything.

879
01:00:00,446 --> 01:00:01,106
[SPEAKER_30]: It's okay.

880
01:00:01,846 --> 01:00:07,730
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't give a fuck about watching an explosion that happened six hours ago, numerous times,

881
01:00:18,517 --> 01:00:19,278
[SPEAKER_30]: all day long.

882
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:20,659
[SPEAKER_30]: Look, it's bombing.

883
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:21,960
[SPEAKER_30]: Look, there's bombing going on.

884
01:00:22,161 --> 01:00:22,741
[SPEAKER_30]: No shit.

885
01:00:22,801 --> 01:00:23,922
[SPEAKER_30]: What do you think they're doing over there?

886
01:00:23,962 --> 01:00:24,803
[SPEAKER_30]: Having a rave?

887
01:00:24,883 --> 01:00:25,604
[SPEAKER_30]: Having a party?

888
01:00:25,924 --> 01:00:26,765
[SPEAKER_30]: Is everyone getting along?

889
01:00:26,885 --> 01:00:29,847
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't care about your fucking bombing and seeing the little explosions.

890
01:00:30,108 --> 01:00:32,270
[SPEAKER_30]: If I wanted to see explosions, I'd watch fireworks.

891
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:33,210
[SPEAKER_30]: You know...

892
01:00:34,091 --> 01:00:37,596
[SPEAKER_30]: It's stupid, and I don't give a crap about half the stuff they have on there.

893
01:00:37,816 --> 01:00:43,503
[SPEAKER_30]: Yahoo News now, there's like, the print is so small because there's so many stupid, you know, headlines on there.

894
01:00:43,984 --> 01:00:44,965
[SPEAKER_30]: I can't read any of it.

895
01:00:45,005 --> 01:00:51,294
[SPEAKER_30]: It's like, uh, soldiers something, something.

896
01:00:52,755 --> 01:00:53,236
[SPEAKER_30]: It's annoying.

897
01:00:53,436 --> 01:00:57,058
[SPEAKER_30]: I just really wish... If I wanted to watch 24-hour news, I'd tune into CNN.

898
01:00:57,138 --> 01:01:04,763
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't want CNN on another station because I'm trying to watch, you know, some other show like American Idol or something like that.

899
01:01:06,524 --> 01:01:08,865
[SPEAKER_30]: My girlfriend watches American Idol, I just watch it with her.

900
01:01:10,226 --> 01:01:10,506
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm done.

901
01:01:19,177 --> 01:01:20,678
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh, my FUs of the week.

902
01:01:20,698 --> 01:01:22,238
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, I haven't even really thought about these.

903
01:01:22,618 --> 01:01:26,980
[SPEAKER_28]: Um, FU to having nothing to really rant about.

904
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,720
[SPEAKER_28]: FU to still being single.

905
01:01:29,281 --> 01:01:30,881
[SPEAKER_28]: FU to six months without sex.

906
01:01:30,961 --> 01:01:31,621
[SPEAKER_28]: That sucks.

907
01:01:34,802 --> 01:01:35,703
[SPEAKER_28]: FU to being tired.

908
01:01:35,783 --> 01:01:40,624
[SPEAKER_28]: I got tired way too easy the other, uh, I got tired way too easy that last night.

909
01:01:40,784 --> 01:01:41,805
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm feeling old.

910
01:01:41,885 --> 01:01:42,545
[SPEAKER_28]: I wasn't even drunk.

911
01:01:42,605 --> 01:01:43,465
[SPEAKER_28]: There's no excuse for that.

912
01:01:44,246 --> 01:01:45,566
[SPEAKER_28]: And, uh, FU to Anita.

913
01:01:45,706 --> 01:01:46,586
[SPEAKER_28]: Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

914
01:01:47,047 --> 01:01:48,127
[SPEAKER_28]: Just like I did at Faces, baby.

915
01:01:49,102 --> 01:01:52,945
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I'm older than you, and if you feel older than me, then you suck.

916
01:01:54,205 --> 01:01:54,566
[SPEAKER_28]: F that.

917
01:01:56,107 --> 01:01:57,708
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, moving on, let's go around the room.

918
01:01:58,108 --> 01:01:58,888
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh, who wants to start?

919
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:01,470
[SPEAKER_28]: Start with Zero?

920
01:02:04,492 --> 01:02:05,433
[SPEAKER_29]: My baby's mama.

921
01:02:05,613 --> 01:02:08,355
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm not even gonna say anything.

922
01:02:09,035 --> 01:02:14,739
[SPEAKER_29]: But about, like, watching fireworks, bombs are really, really big fireworks that blow up people's houses and buildings.

923
01:02:16,249 --> 01:02:24,716
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, but I didn't see any bodies flying in the air, nothing happening, they're all... Like earlier today, they just had a picture of the night sky, they're all... They're all now... Hold on, hold on, hold on.

924
01:02:24,736 --> 01:02:25,096
[SPEAKER_30]: Hear that?

925
01:02:25,276 --> 01:02:25,857
[SPEAKER_30]: In the distance?

926
01:02:26,077 --> 01:02:28,899
[SPEAKER_30]: There's bombing going on... FALL AWAY WHERE WE CAN'T SEE IT!

927
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,941
[SPEAKER_30]: BUT WE'RE STILL SHOWING THE GODDAMN CITY!

928
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:32,202
[SPEAKER_30]: WHO CARES?

929
01:02:32,302 --> 01:02:33,002
[SPEAKER_30]: TURN IT OFF!

930
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:34,924
[SPEAKER_30]: DO SOME OTHER NEWS!

931
01:02:34,964 --> 01:02:38,386
[SPEAKER_30]: I'M SURE THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENING IN THE WORLD OTHER THAN THIS STUPID BOMBING!

932
01:02:38,627 --> 01:02:39,787
[SPEAKER_30]: NO, EVERYTHING'S STOPPED!

933
01:02:40,868 --> 01:02:41,529
[SPEAKER_30]: Just for the bombing.

934
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:49,930
[SPEAKER_29]: No, but I gotta, like, the only thing I really like about watching those is when they make you listen to all the gunfire and all the stuff.

935
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:55,434
[SPEAKER_29]: You know somebody's dying somewhere, or someone just got blown up, and that's the coolest part about the reward.

936
01:02:55,714 --> 01:03:01,437
[SPEAKER_18]: Fox News showed the caravan, and then they showed camels and goats following the tanks.

937
01:03:01,597 --> 01:03:06,920
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, after some stupid fucking guy says, yeah, we see camels out here, and they're very distressed.

938
01:03:07,461 --> 01:03:07,981
[SPEAKER_29]: It's like, whatever.

939
01:03:08,021 --> 01:03:09,242
[SPEAKER_29]: But anyways, back to my FUs.

940
01:03:10,016 --> 01:03:13,143
[SPEAKER_29]: One, I have an F you to, well, kind of war related.

941
01:03:13,384 --> 01:03:16,010
[SPEAKER_29]: There's a stupid guy in the UK and I know he's listening.

942
01:03:17,313 --> 01:03:18,476
[SPEAKER_29]: Stop sending me fucking...

943
01:03:19,742 --> 01:03:27,967
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, or IMs over MSN Messenger telling me to go on busy for 15 minutes to, to like, grieve the 15 UK soldiers who died.

944
01:03:28,567 --> 01:03:33,330
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm not gonna go on 15, on a 15 minute busy every damn 15 fucking minutes.

945
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:41,514
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, you might be an absolute sort of stupid loser, and who the hell cares, get a life, and get off the internet and go do something.

946
01:03:42,355 --> 01:03:42,435
[SPEAKER_29]: Um...

947
01:03:45,745 --> 01:03:47,385
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh my god, say that again.

948
01:03:48,006 --> 01:03:52,107
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, because Dreamcatcher told me that British people are aliens anyways.

949
01:03:52,947 --> 01:03:53,947
[SPEAKER_30]: Giant worm aliens.

950
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:55,167
[SPEAKER_30]: They're shit weasels.

951
01:03:55,727 --> 01:03:57,108
[SPEAKER_30]: They fly out of your ass.

952
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:58,648
[SPEAKER_25]: Like Sam Cassell.

953
01:03:59,148 --> 01:04:00,689
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.

954
01:04:01,249 --> 01:04:02,489
[SPEAKER_29]: My other FU is to my computer.

955
01:04:02,509 --> 01:04:08,290
[SPEAKER_29]: I just got a new webcam, and it'll install it, and then give me a fucking warning every damn time I try to open the stupid program.

956
01:04:09,071 --> 01:04:10,311
[SPEAKER_18]: Give me your webcam, you can have mine.

957
01:04:12,397 --> 01:04:14,924
[SPEAKER_29]: If it works, I mean, mine's just stupid.

958
01:04:14,964 --> 01:04:15,225
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

959
01:04:17,137 --> 01:04:18,958
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, well, I might have to reinstall the thing.

960
01:04:19,078 --> 01:04:31,265
[SPEAKER_29]: But anyways, um, another FU is to, like, the friggin', whatchacallit, like, not having money sucks, but I got money yesterday, though, so I'm okay with that.

961
01:04:31,585 --> 01:04:44,373
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, an FU is to the stupid bastard who decided it'd be a good idea to take off the damn yard sale signs at my mom's yard sale, so I had to go and fucking put up all ten of them again, and if I ever see you again, because I know who you are, I swear to God I will kill you.

962
01:04:45,873 --> 01:04:52,965
[SPEAKER_29]: Another F you is to these stupid shrimp chips because they're too addicting and they make me sick.

963
01:04:53,226 --> 01:04:53,446
[SPEAKER_29]: What?

964
01:04:54,848 --> 01:04:55,750
[SPEAKER_25]: Sponsored by Kelby.

965
01:04:58,158 --> 01:05:00,340
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, that's all I really got right now.

966
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:08,406
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh yeah, stupid, um, fuck you to the stupid road to perdition, getting the best cinematography, uh, just winning for cinematography.

967
01:05:08,786 --> 01:05:16,031
[SPEAKER_29]: It should have gone to, um, uh, what is it, Gangs of New York, because they actually did really well, and that's all I gotta say, so I'm done.

968
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:18,253
[SPEAKER_29]: One last thing, you are cool.

969
01:05:19,614 --> 01:05:25,398
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright, first off, um, I wanna give some fuck you's out to everyone that is listening.

970
01:05:26,459 --> 01:05:26,840
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

971
01:05:27,708 --> 01:05:28,429
[SPEAKER_26]: Very, very much.

972
01:05:29,289 --> 01:05:34,833
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright, the next fuck you goes out to the Tomahawk Missiles, the Cruise Missiles, and the Patriot Missiles.

973
01:05:35,733 --> 01:05:38,435
[SPEAKER_26]: Each missile costs us about 1 and 2 million each.

974
01:05:38,755 --> 01:05:41,457
[SPEAKER_26]: We're launching billions of missiles on the air atmosphere.

975
01:05:41,937 --> 01:05:50,402
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, all that money that we've been spending on these fucking missiles could be going to the Somalians so we can be feeding the Somalians, giving them food, and building future terrorists.

976
01:05:50,743 --> 01:05:51,043
[SPEAKER_26]: You know?

977
01:05:51,963 --> 01:05:54,245
[SPEAKER_26]: So I think we're killing two birds with one stone right now, aren't we?

978
01:05:55,200 --> 01:06:20,858
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright, yeah, yeah, my next fuck you goes out to Windows XP, today I was trying to, you guys shouldn't do this, I was trying to install a pirated copy of Windows XP, but I tried to get a Windows update and it wouldn't let me because it was pirated, what the fuck, why would I even, I got a corporate version for you if you want it.

979
01:06:22,699 --> 01:06:25,621
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright, uh, fuck you to professional Windows XP.

980
01:06:26,582 --> 01:06:27,843
[SPEAKER_26]: Amen to the corporate versions.

981
01:06:36,709 --> 01:06:42,814
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright, fuck, okay, my next fuck you goes out to all these people on the freeways that speed, that don't know how to drive.

982
01:06:43,314 --> 01:06:46,256
[SPEAKER_26]: Cause on my way to Sacramento today, I was stuck in traffic.

983
01:06:46,877 --> 01:06:48,358
[SPEAKER_26]: No, not because traffic was slow.

984
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:52,102
[SPEAKER_26]: But some idiots decided to get into a car accident.

985
01:06:52,322 --> 01:06:56,965
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, they did decide to get into it because they were driving probably 150 miles an hour in a 70 zone.

986
01:06:57,445 --> 01:07:00,607
[SPEAKER_26]: But it's alright because they're on stretchers now and they're feeling the pain.

987
01:07:01,468 --> 01:07:02,048
[SPEAKER_26]: Hint, hint.

988
01:07:02,348 --> 01:07:03,049
[SPEAKER_26]: Don't be stupid.

989
01:07:04,830 --> 01:07:06,971
[SPEAKER_26]: Let me see, where does my next fuck you go to?

990
01:07:07,872 --> 01:07:08,772
[SPEAKER_26]: I had it a second ago.

991
01:07:08,872 --> 01:07:09,573
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, come back to me.

992
01:07:10,453 --> 01:07:11,654
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll pass it on until I get it back.

993
01:07:12,775 --> 01:07:14,376
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm going to use this mic because it's a bit better.

994
01:07:15,325 --> 01:07:16,526
[SPEAKER_20]: I got a lot of fuck you's.

995
01:07:17,406 --> 01:07:27,430
[SPEAKER_20]: First off, fuck you to all your stupid, high horse, prissy little DDR players that make fun of all those people who are just beginning or you think are just beginning.

996
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:29,171
[SPEAKER_20]: I know who you motherfuckers are.

997
01:07:29,551 --> 01:07:31,512
[SPEAKER_20]: You guys were laughing at me when I was playing.

998
01:07:31,592 --> 01:07:33,413
[SPEAKER_20]: You have no idea who the hell I am.

999
01:07:33,713 --> 01:07:34,933
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm coming after you fools.

1000
01:07:35,974 --> 01:07:37,074
[SPEAKER_20]: Next big fuck you.

1001
01:07:37,594 --> 01:07:39,095
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to get a lot of shit for this one.

1002
01:07:40,315 --> 01:07:42,156
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck you, President Bush.

1003
01:07:42,676 --> 01:07:44,817
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck you and this goddamn war.

1004
01:07:45,117 --> 01:07:50,900
[SPEAKER_20]: Spending $400 billion on this goddamn war.

1005
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:53,821
[SPEAKER_20]: $161 billion would solve all the problems with our education system.

1006
01:07:54,301 --> 01:07:55,342
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck you, Bush.

1007
01:07:56,762 --> 01:07:57,663
[SPEAKER_20]: Or free the Somalians.

1008
01:07:59,063 --> 01:08:01,024
[SPEAKER_20]: Another big fuck you involved in the war.

1009
01:08:01,624 --> 01:08:05,826
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck you, American media and all your goddamn lies.

1010
01:08:06,787 --> 01:08:07,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, we're the media.

1011
01:08:08,612 --> 01:08:09,112
[SPEAKER_20]: We're indie.

1012
01:08:09,813 --> 01:08:10,694
[SPEAKER_20]: Not American press.

1013
01:08:11,774 --> 01:08:12,575
[SPEAKER_20]: Indie press is cool.

1014
01:08:12,615 --> 01:08:13,335
[SPEAKER_20]: Indie press is cool.

1015
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:14,356
[SPEAKER_20]: I ain't got nothing against them.

1016
01:08:15,217 --> 01:08:17,198
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see, what other big fuck yous?

1017
01:08:18,379 --> 01:08:22,642
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, media needs to just stop telling us that they know shit, but then say, oh, but we don't know that for sure.

1018
01:08:25,845 --> 01:08:31,529
[SPEAKER_30]: Whatever happened to that shuttle crash that, I don't know, took place a while back and then all of a sudden, oh, hey, war!

1019
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:35,337
[SPEAKER_20]: Whatever happened to, uh, what was that guy's name again?

1020
01:08:35,538 --> 01:08:37,724
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, what was it?

1021
01:08:38,205 --> 01:08:39,449
[SPEAKER_20]: Osama bin Laden.

1022
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:40,271
[SPEAKER_20]: Where's he?

1023
01:08:41,218 --> 01:08:43,699
[SPEAKER_20]: But anyways, another big fuck you.

1024
01:08:43,839 --> 01:08:44,579
[SPEAKER_20]: Gas prices.

1025
01:08:44,699 --> 01:08:47,419
[SPEAKER_28]: What about stories about how ugly Rosie O'Donnell is?

1026
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:48,700
[SPEAKER_28]: Why don't I see those anymore?

1027
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:51,080
[SPEAKER_28]: Because the lesbians gave up on that one.

1028
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:54,241
[SPEAKER_30]: And did Michael Jackson just stop molesting kids all of a sudden, you know?

1029
01:08:54,801 --> 01:08:55,021
[SPEAKER_30]: Huh?

1030
01:08:55,361 --> 01:08:59,362
[SPEAKER_26]: And we've tried so hard to get Rosie O'Donnell out of our minds, so yeah.

1031
01:08:59,882 --> 01:09:01,123
[SPEAKER_30]: You know what's funny about this whole thing?

1032
01:09:01,283 --> 01:09:02,663
[SPEAKER_30]: They're never going to catch Saddam.

1033
01:09:02,883 --> 01:09:04,363
[SPEAKER_30]: He's just going to slip through again.

1034
01:09:04,384 --> 01:09:06,584
[SPEAKER_30]: And we're going to have this all in like another ten years.

1035
01:09:07,064 --> 01:09:07,844
[SPEAKER_30]: All over again.

1036
01:09:08,584 --> 01:09:10,385
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that he exists in a virtual reality.

1037
01:09:11,781 --> 01:09:15,862
[SPEAKER_29]: Osama Bin Laden's hand is up Saddam's ass, that's where he is.

1038
01:09:16,422 --> 01:09:18,623
[SPEAKER_26]: Saddam's been dead for 20 years, haven't you guys known that?

1039
01:09:18,683 --> 01:09:19,763
[SPEAKER_26]: He's been using one of his doubles.

1040
01:09:22,104 --> 01:09:22,904
[SPEAKER_28]: But he has a live journal.

1041
01:09:23,645 --> 01:09:32,867
[SPEAKER_26]: So there's one post, because there's one computer that's actually connected to the internet.

1042
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:33,828
[SPEAKER_26]: Good job!

1043
01:09:37,856 --> 01:09:39,558
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, another fuck you.

1044
01:09:40,218 --> 01:09:41,279
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't remember your name.

1045
01:09:41,299 --> 01:09:43,141
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't remember what you look like.

1046
01:09:43,662 --> 01:09:46,564
[SPEAKER_20]: It was at Asian Innovation's birthday party.

1047
01:09:46,965 --> 01:09:49,627
[SPEAKER_20]: You showed up uninvited, but with Hyperbroken.

1048
01:09:50,268 --> 01:09:51,549
[SPEAKER_20]: No beef against Hyperbroken.

1049
01:09:51,589 --> 01:09:53,010
[SPEAKER_20]: Hyperbroken, you're cool, alright?

1050
01:09:53,511 --> 01:09:59,176
[SPEAKER_20]: But this motherfucker, tall ass, lanky white dude, he's about 6'3", you might know who he is.

1051
01:09:59,417 --> 01:10:00,297
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh shit, it's Brad.

1052
01:10:02,294 --> 01:10:03,775
[SPEAKER_20]: I only know his call name, I'm sorry.

1053
01:10:04,155 --> 01:10:08,777
[SPEAKER_20]: But this motherfucker, alright, I send money out with Hyperbroken to pick up some drinks.

1054
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:14,660
[SPEAKER_20]: That does not mean this motherfucker can then go and spend some of my goddamn money on his own personal drink.

1055
01:10:15,061 --> 01:10:17,142
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what tall, lanky-ass white boy did.

1056
01:10:17,662 --> 01:10:19,163
[SPEAKER_20]: If you know who he is, let me know.

1057
01:10:19,203 --> 01:10:20,083
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to find his ass.

1058
01:10:20,103 --> 01:10:21,364
[SPEAKER_20]: He still owes me two bucks.

1059
01:10:23,354 --> 01:10:24,174
[SPEAKER_20]: Motherfuck you.

1060
01:10:25,455 --> 01:10:32,317
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck you to the people who are unemployed and can go to bed and stay asleep till 2 in the goddamn afternoon.

1061
01:10:33,038 --> 01:10:35,258
[SPEAKER_20]: I envy all you guys, so fuck you.

1062
01:10:35,799 --> 01:10:37,139
[SPEAKER_18]: But I want to have a job.

1063
01:10:37,659 --> 01:10:38,419
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I need money.

1064
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,560
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not getting unemployment.

1065
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,061
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, that sucks.

1066
01:10:42,081 --> 01:10:46,362
[SPEAKER_18]: I could, but I'm not because my man makes enough to support us both, which is enough.

1067
01:10:47,403 --> 01:10:49,323
[SPEAKER_18]: But... Hey!

1068
01:10:49,864 --> 01:10:50,784
[SPEAKER_18]: Tell someone to hire me!

1069
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:53,241
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

1070
01:10:54,381 --> 01:10:57,024
[SPEAKER_28]: Chat room is demanding we get to their FUs, so here we go.

1071
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:58,084
[SPEAKER_28]: Fuck you!

01:10:58,184 --> 01:10:59,485
[SPEAKER_28]: Here we go.

1073
01:10:59,525 --> 01:11:02,468
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck the chat room FUs for breaking up my fuck you.

1074
01:11:02,488 --> 01:11:03,388
[SPEAKER_28]: What were you doing?

1075
01:11:03,428 --> 01:11:04,449
[SPEAKER_28]: Did you have anything else you wanted to add?

1076
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:09,053
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck you, the crazy-ass women giving us double signals.

1077
01:11:09,753 --> 01:11:11,855
[SPEAKER_20]: One minute they hot, one minute they cold.

1078
01:11:11,875 --> 01:11:13,877
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't know what the fuck is going on.

1079
01:11:15,117 --> 01:11:16,358
[SPEAKER_18]: That just means they're in menopause.

1080
01:11:18,359 --> 01:11:18,419
[SPEAKER_20]: At 22?

1081
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:18,780
[SPEAKER_20]: Shit.

1082
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:21,321
[SPEAKER_28]: I was thinking exactly.

1083
01:11:22,062 --> 01:11:27,986
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, I got a fuck you to Sacramento because I cannot find a bank anywhere.

1084
01:11:28,086 --> 01:11:30,548
[SPEAKER_26]: When you need money, you cannot find a bank anywhere on the road.

1085
01:11:30,588 --> 01:11:31,268
[SPEAKER_26]: Who do you bank at?

1086
01:11:31,748 --> 01:11:32,269
[SPEAKER_28]: Wells Fargo.

1087
01:11:32,569 --> 01:11:33,550

[SPEAKER_28]: They have a Wells Fargo in them.

1092
01:11:39,823 --> 01:12:03,441

01:12:40,931 --> 01:12:41,973
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you a male or a female?

1106
01:12:42,253 --> 01:12:42,513
[SPEAKER_20]: Male.

1107
01:12:42,934 --> 01:12:43,575
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, nevermind.

1109
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:51,844
[SPEAKER_28]: I started out with a sore throat that developed into a cold, then went away, then came back.

1110
01:12:52,305 --> 01:12:52,525
[SPEAKER_28]: Also...

1111
01:12:53,286 --> 01:12:57,508
[SPEAKER_28]: My left foot hurt at the beginning of the week and then stopped hurting and now my right foot hurts.

1112
01:12:57,908 --> 01:13:01,170
[SPEAKER_28]: It also kept me from getting anything accomplished this week since I didn't want to go out at all.

1113
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:05,511
[SPEAKER_28]: Fuck you to tailgaters who can't see that you can't move up any farther in traffic.

1114
01:13:05,551 --> 01:13:06,132
[SPEAKER_28]: Fucking idiots.

01:13:10,794 --> 01:13:12,354
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck you goddamn pneumonia.

1117
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:16,376
[SPEAKER_20]: Once you get rid of a cold, this motherfucker kicks in and it doesn't go away.

1118
01:13:18,497 --> 01:13:20,258
[SPEAKER_26]: Fuck you to bad Chinese immigration.

[SPEAKER_28]: F you to, or I'm sorry, Subdisciplinary says he's angsty this week.

1120
01:13:25,862 --> 01:13:31,825
[SPEAKER_28]: So a big fat fuck you goes out to all the people at Fry's for not having metal pads when I really wanted them and had the money to buy them.

1121
01:13:31,885 --> 01:13:33,046
[SPEAKER_28]: I call, they say they have them.

1122
01:13:33,346 --> 01:13:35,247
[SPEAKER_28]: I get there and they're like, oh, you mean the metal ones?

1123
01:13:35,287 --> 01:13:36,268
[SPEAKER_28]: We don't have those anymore.

1124
01:13:36,648 --> 01:13:39,890
[SPEAKER_28]: So fuck them for being fucking retarded cousin-humping cock gobblers.

[SPEAKER_28]: Also, fuck you to my current pads for sucking so much.

[SPEAKER_28]: I can't pass any onis on these fucking steaming piles of monkey doo that have arrows scrawled in them.

1127
01:13:47,838 --> 01:13:50,441
[SPEAKER_28]: Fuck those poo pads.

01:13:53,204 --> 01:13:54,325
[SPEAKER_18]: Cock Gobbler.

01:13:55,066 --> 01:13:55,606
[SPEAKER_18]: That's cool.

1130
01:13:56,487 --> 01:13:57,768
[SPEAKER_18]: That's almost as cool as ass meat.

1131
01:13:57,788 --> 01:13:59,530
[SPEAKER_28]: No, you missed this.

1132
01:13:59,690 --> 01:14:00,872
[SPEAKER_28]: Fuck those poo pads.

1133
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:08,001
[SPEAKER_28]: Also, fuck my new shoes for not being dusty and frippy and shit.

1134
01:14:08,121 --> 01:14:11,242
[SPEAKER_28]: I get like 47 greats on Matsuri Japan yesterday and that's too many.

1135
01:14:11,282 --> 01:14:14,883
[SPEAKER_28]: I miss my old DCs because they weren't flaming pieces of lemur shit.

1136
01:14:15,403 --> 01:14:18,223
[SPEAKER_28]: I can PA about as well as a mouse sphincter now.

1137
01:14:19,924 --> 01:14:20,664
[SPEAKER_28]: Wow, that's all.

01:14:20,824 --> 01:14:25,405
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh wait, fuck you to not being able to go to the Bomani party last night because I wanted to show off my edits in Step Mania Files.

1139
01:14:27,774 --> 01:14:33,517
[SPEAKER_29]: It's okay, I'm going to have more, so you have to promise to at least come to one of my upcoming ones.

1140
01:14:33,718 --> 01:14:37,620
[SPEAKER_28]: Ness151 says, can I F you DDR Coralville again for DDR extremage?

1141
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:38,821
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, sure.

01:14:40,502 --> 01:14:44,184
[SPEAKER_28]: SkylineDC505 says, F you to Starbucks for being so damn expensive.

1143
01:14:47,867 --> 01:14:52,592
[SPEAKER_28]: Japan Man says, fuck all the hair cutters in my city for doing a lousy ass job every time I get a haircut.

1144
01:14:52,632 --> 01:14:55,975
[SPEAKER_28]: Fuck the mall for throwing you out for just carrying a skateboard.

1145
01:14:56,576 --> 01:14:59,859
[SPEAKER_28]: Fuck my dad for bitching about me doing stuff that I didn't do, plain and simple.

1146
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:01,701
[SPEAKER_28]: No, screw my dad one, oops.

1147
01:15:02,542 --> 01:15:02,842
Oops!

1148
01:15:03,703 --> 01:15:06,986
[SPEAKER_28]: Fuck the poppin' music non-stop for making me get one good three times in a row.

1149
01:15:08,327 --> 01:15:12,010
[SPEAKER_28]: That guy was so stupid, he was in the middle of Madison on a bike.

1150
01:15:33,974 --> 01:15:35,217
[SPEAKER_18]: In the middle, crossing traffic.

1151
01:15:35,618 --> 01:15:36,259
[SPEAKER_29]: For no reason.

1152
01:15:36,279 --> 01:15:37,261
[SPEAKER_18]: What a moron.

1153
01:15:37,421 --> 01:15:39,245
[SPEAKER_18]: And that, and he looked like a troll too.

1154
01:15:39,706 --> 01:15:41,409
[SPEAKER_29]: You should have gotten another kid's nil.

1155
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:42,692
[SPEAKER_29]: Maybe you would have felt better.

1156
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:49,618
[SPEAKER_28]: Rice, RYC3, says F you to AOL and I'll leave it at that.

1157
01:15:50,118 --> 01:15:52,340
[SPEAKER_28]: F you to dumb people, F you to stupid kids at CGL.

1158
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:54,461
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright, I have a fucky.

1159
01:15:54,481 --> 01:15:55,742
[SPEAKER_26]: Fucky for all these kids.

1160
01:15:56,202 --> 01:16:01,947
[SPEAKER_26]: There are, like, probably 12 to 15 that are thinking that AOL is the only way you can connect to the internet.

1161
01:16:02,887 --> 01:16:07,951
[SPEAKER_20]: Big fuck you to all you kids who post comments saying fuck you to other kids when you're a kid yourself.

1162
01:16:09,338 --> 01:16:13,779
[SPEAKER_30]: F you to frickin' AOL for ruining the whole theme to the Six Million Dollar Man.

1163
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:15,660
[SPEAKER_30]: You suck.

1164
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:19,101
[SPEAKER_30]: Their new commercial is the Six Million Dollar Man theme, and they fucked it up.

1165
01:16:19,501 --> 01:16:23,542
[SPEAKER_18]: See, I don't watch TV, so I don't know these things.

1166
01:16:24,022 --> 01:16:27,983
[SPEAKER_18]: I still have AOL, but that's just because I don't want to get rid of my DarkSakura and Killmilder.

1167
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:42,161
[SPEAKER_26]: I have a sentimental attachment, I've had that name for like 9 years now Another fuck you to AOL for being so complicated now, you can't sign on without a fucking GPS system

1168
01:16:44,763 --> 01:16:47,966
[SPEAKER_28]: EOSFVB says, fuck you to war, if you can even call it that.

1169
01:16:48,087 --> 01:16:50,709
[SPEAKER_28]: It's more like an assault, seeing as how Iraq can't do shit.

1170
01:16:50,949 --> 01:16:54,193
[SPEAKER_28]: They've got like three anti-aircraft water balloons and a Nerf gun.

1171
01:16:54,493 --> 01:16:54,993
[SPEAKER_28]: Who cares?

1172
01:16:55,474 --> 01:16:56,815
[SPEAKER_28]: Saddam gasses his own people.

1173
01:16:57,576 --> 01:16:59,518
[SPEAKER_28]: Those people suck dick, so fuck them too.

1174
01:16:59,938 --> 01:17:02,400
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, yeah, fuck that shit.

1175
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:06,044
[SPEAKER_18]: One thing about that, BBC.com has actually a really good breakdown of...

1176
01:17:07,915 --> 01:17:13,425
[SPEAKER_18]: What the average quality of life is as far as what people make, how much things cost.

1177
01:17:13,826 --> 01:17:15,810
[SPEAKER_30]: They wear pink scarves, goddammit!

1178
01:17:17,034 --> 01:17:21,198
[SPEAKER_18]: I just kind of, I mean, I understand what they think the reasons are.

1179
01:17:21,238 --> 01:17:23,740
[SPEAKER_18]: My brother's actually in the Marines over in Kuwait right now.

1180
01:17:24,741 --> 01:17:27,684
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you going to trust the media that's ran by Tony Blair?

1181
01:17:28,605 --> 01:17:32,869
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, apart from that, though, I mean, you can go look anywhere and find the same stats.

1182
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:40,516
[SPEAKER_18]: But I find it very funny that the average doctor makes $45 a month, whereas how much does the average doctor make a year per month?

1183
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:44,552
[SPEAKER_18]: They maybe make $45 a half hour?

1184
01:17:52,678 --> 01:17:54,319
[SPEAKER_30]: You know, Iraq doesn't really exist.

1185
01:17:54,399 --> 01:18:00,904
[SPEAKER_30]: It's just a giant pool for all the money that Bush is spending right now to go to the Area 51 and Alien Projects things.

1186
01:18:01,384 --> 01:18:02,825
[SPEAKER_30]: Really, this whole war does not exist.

1187
01:18:02,885 --> 01:18:04,266
[SPEAKER_30]: It's a big, giant cover-up.

1188
01:18:05,147 --> 01:18:06,168
[SPEAKER_30]: You heard it here first!

1189
01:18:09,778 --> 01:18:11,960
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, I think he's trying to compensate for something.

1190
01:18:13,701 --> 01:18:16,343
[SPEAKER_28]: It's actually all taking place in the studio in New Mexico.

1191
01:18:16,363 --> 01:18:20,907
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright, I want to give a fuck you out to France, Montreal, and Quebec.

1192
01:18:21,667 --> 01:18:28,152
[SPEAKER_26]: First of all, yeah, it's not French fries anymore, it's American fries, and call everything Freedom Fries on American toast.

1193
01:18:28,272 --> 01:18:29,213
[SPEAKER_18]: They're from Belgium.

1194
01:18:30,034 --> 01:18:32,055
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, about France real quick.

1195
01:18:32,916 --> 01:18:37,760
[SPEAKER_20]: How can we say fuck you, because they were going to just go against one of our security resolutions that we proposed.

1196
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:39,160
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, come on, the U.S.

1197
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:42,642
[SPEAKER_20]: has vetoed over 24 U.S.

1198
01:18:42,702 --> 01:18:47,183
[SPEAKER_20]: resolutions that were going to reprimand Israel for what they've done to the Palestinians.

1199
01:18:47,343 --> 01:18:49,224
[SPEAKER_20]: And we get pissed off because of one veto.

1200
01:18:49,944 --> 01:18:52,245
[SPEAKER_15]: How about Calvin's Quet de Mer?

1201
01:18:53,926 --> 01:18:54,506
[SPEAKER_15]: Out of shit.

1202
01:18:54,726 --> 01:18:59,888
[SPEAKER_26]: Speaking of head of state, that's going to be a good movie.

1203
01:19:04,891 --> 01:19:09,315
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm looking at a picture that Jazz posted in the chatroom.

1204
01:19:09,515 --> 01:19:11,777
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all greats on Happy Wedding, and thank you.

1205
01:19:21,047 --> 01:19:22,428
[SPEAKER_28]: And that'll get you a C, yeah.

1206
01:19:22,628 --> 01:19:23,008
[SPEAKER_28]: Interesting.

1207
01:19:23,368 --> 01:19:24,649
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, anyway, let's finish up the FUs.

1208
01:19:25,049 --> 01:19:26,830
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not done yet.

1209
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:31,312
[SPEAKER_28]: Manikinigo Jazz says, FU to having no money because now I can't go to March Madness.

1210
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:32,713
[SPEAKER_28]: Cry, sniff.

1211
01:19:32,873 --> 01:19:33,753
[SPEAKER_28]: You need to get up here somehow.

1212
01:19:34,954 --> 01:19:36,575
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'm going to jump the bandwagon.

1213
01:19:36,775 --> 01:19:37,495
[SPEAKER_28]: FU to being single.

1214
01:19:43,792 --> 01:19:46,256
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm white, what do you expect, babe?

1215
01:19:47,238 --> 01:19:53,407
[SPEAKER_28]: That's it, oh, I have to check the mailbag, but as far as I know, that's it, so Does DDRholic have something?

1216
01:19:56,212 --> 01:20:01,116
[SPEAKER_30]: Once again, continuing FU to the DDR Extreme Roulette System.

1217
01:20:01,516 --> 01:20:02,176
[SPEAKER_30]: God damn it!

1218
01:20:02,817 --> 01:20:03,497
[SPEAKER_30]: Fucking A!

1219
01:20:03,677 --> 01:20:06,840
[SPEAKER_30]: Every fucking time I do Roulette, I get one away from Legend of Max!

1220
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:09,521
[SPEAKER_30]: And you taunt me with your goddamn shifting!

1221
01:20:09,902 --> 01:20:11,623
[SPEAKER_30]: It goes to Legend of Max, and it's like, Ha!

1222
01:20:12,003 --> 01:20:12,724
[SPEAKER_30]: You can't have that!

1223
01:20:12,784 --> 01:20:15,205
[SPEAKER_30]: You can have 2D Chaser Morning Mix instead!

1224
01:20:15,546 --> 01:20:16,126
[SPEAKER_30]: Asshole!

1225
01:20:16,927 --> 01:20:18,748
[SPEAKER_30]: So, FU to the freaking Roulette System.

1226
01:20:19,033 --> 01:20:22,577
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, I could go on and on with fuck yous for the whole entire night.

1227
01:20:23,157 --> 01:20:35,409
[SPEAKER_20]: If anyone wants to hear the rest of my fuck yous, you can catch me on AIM under darkchild999, that's C-H-Y-L-D-E-9-9-9, or on Yahoo on dchild999, or on ICQ at 110960221.

[SPEAKER_20]: or you can email me at darkchild999 at hotmail, dchild999 at yahoo, jwilson at wowdy.net, wilsonjason at acmsystems.com, and I could go on and on, but that's enough.

1230
01:20:51,922 --> 01:20:55,687
[SPEAKER_30]: I wonder if I should make a Bomani player singles page on my website.

1231
01:20:59,383 --> 01:21:00,083
[SPEAKER_26]: That would be funny.

1232
01:21:00,443 --> 01:21:00,724
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright.

1233
01:21:01,304 --> 01:21:05,506
[SPEAKER_26]: I want to give a fuck you out to Singular Wireless for only having reception when your phone is off.

1234
01:21:06,206 --> 01:21:12,508
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know why what you said just gave me flashbacks to that thing posted on DDR Freak that J-Dog posted.

1235
01:21:13,069 --> 01:21:15,030
[SPEAKER_18]: The hi, please date me thing.

1238
01:21:23,153 --> 01:21:25,674
[SPEAKER_28]: Can I elaborate on that as long as we're going to be controversial here?

1239
01:21:26,943 --> 01:21:38,378
[SPEAKER_20]: fuck you for being a whiny little bitch because some people made fun of your little slide, slide, slide AM3P routine made fun of it, had a good time and you had a little hissy fit about it oh poor baby

[SPEAKER_28]: Address those cards and letters to D. Okay, so I think we're finally done.

1241
01:21:50,977 --> 01:21:53,579
[SPEAKER_28]: Is everybody feeling a little less angsty now that we were able to get that off?

1242
01:21:53,599 --> 01:21:54,460
[SPEAKER_18]: I always feel angsty.

1243
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:55,181

01:30:33,625 --> 01:30:37,267
[SPEAKER_18]: The one that you were playing over last night had them doing Butterfly, but you could hear the background music.

1294
01:30:37,307 --> 01:30:38,208
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's how they do it.

1295
01:30:38,228 --> 01:30:43,992
[SPEAKER_30]: He just did Felice 100 Seconds and some other one, I forget, with some other song.

01:30:44,232 --> 01:30:44,873
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob, you should play that.

1297
01:30:44,893 --> 01:30:47,595

[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I have it.

1303
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:08,405
[SPEAKER_18]: I think Rob has it, because Rob, we have to play, um... Which one were you looking for?

1304
01:31:09,566 --> 01:31:10,047
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

1305
01:31:10,067 --> 01:31:11,028
[SPEAKER_28]: You guys took over.

1306
01:31:11,788 --> 01:31:12,609
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't do anything.

1307
01:31:12,649 --> 01:31:13,170
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sitting here.

1308
01:31:17,173 --> 01:31:20,895
[SPEAKER_18]: We have dead airspace.

1309
01:31:21,015 --> 01:31:22,296
[SPEAKER_18]: Dead airspace.

1310
01:31:23,917 --> 01:31:25,198
[SPEAKER_18]: Here, Anita's going to talk.

1311
01:31:25,278 --> 01:31:25,958
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, sing for us.

1312
01:31:27,019 --> 01:31:29,380
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, so we can't really find the Coutinho stuff right now.

1313
01:31:29,701 --> 01:31:30,081
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll look.

1314
01:31:30,641 --> 01:31:32,242
[SPEAKER_28]: Maybe we'll look and see if we can get it later.

1315
01:31:33,423 --> 01:31:36,245
[SPEAKER_16]: What's new at tonight's farmer's market?

1316
01:31:36,265 --> 01:31:36,805
[SPEAKER_16]: An auction.

1317
01:31:38,486 --> 01:31:38,946
[SPEAKER_28]: What the hell?

1318
01:31:38,986 --> 01:31:40,487
[SPEAKER_28]: When did this turn into karaoke night?

1319
01:31:42,588 --> 01:31:44,810
[SPEAKER_28]: You want to serenade us with some DDR karaoke?

1320
01:31:45,570 --> 01:31:46,831
[SPEAKER_17]: Sing for us some DDR karaoke.

1321
01:31:47,796 --> 01:31:49,077
[SPEAKER_28]: You want some background music?

1322
01:31:49,117 --> 01:31:50,738
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if I know the words to anything.

1323
01:31:50,798 --> 01:31:56,262
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, aye, aye, aye, I'm your little butterfly.

1324
01:31:56,742 --> 01:32:00,005
[SPEAKER_16]: Green, black, and blue, paint like flowers in the sky.

1325
01:32:00,645 --> 01:32:01,546
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye, aye, aye.

1326
01:32:03,848 --> 01:32:04,928
[SPEAKER_18]: And he just voiced the game.

1327
01:32:08,071 --> 01:32:11,213
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's wait for DWI to come out for that.

1328
01:32:17,383 --> 01:32:18,304
[SPEAKER_20]: The whole Barry White thing?

1329
01:32:18,964 --> 01:32:21,105
[SPEAKER_20]: It's called pneumonia, that's what it's called, not Barry White.

1330
01:32:22,265 --> 01:32:24,026
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, I'll sing the words of one good song.

1331
01:32:24,586 --> 01:32:27,188
[SPEAKER_20]: Mommy, play this song, trip machine.

1332
01:32:27,408 --> 01:32:28,208
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, that's the whole song.

1333
01:32:31,430 --> 01:32:32,570
[SPEAKER_20]: Asian Innovations turn.

1334
01:32:32,730 --> 01:32:36,732
[SPEAKER_20]: I remember we used to have some kind of really good butterfly rethink that we did for it.

1335
01:32:36,752 --> 01:32:38,533
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think he remembers it though.

1336
01:32:45,635 --> 01:32:47,456
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah, I can, I guess.

1337
01:32:48,896 --> 01:32:53,718
[SPEAKER_26]: I can't think of anything I want to sing about.

1338
01:32:53,738 --> 01:33:01,221
[SPEAKER_23]: I can see the stars, cause I'm in the sky, wherever you are, I'm gonna see you fly.

1339
01:33:02,462 --> 01:33:03,442
That was perfect.

1340
01:33:04,383 --> 01:33:07,104
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, if you also think Japanese, what?

1341
01:33:08,664 --> 01:33:09,405
[SPEAKER_16]: We have ferret mix.

1342
01:33:15,922 --> 01:33:20,185
[SPEAKER_28]: They're suggesting in the chat room that we actually have a karaoke contest at Mountain Mike's.

1343
01:33:21,947 --> 01:33:23,268
[SPEAKER_16]: March Madness, David!

1344
01:33:23,888 --> 01:33:24,729
[SPEAKER_16]: March Madness.

1345
01:33:26,670 --> 01:33:28,212
[SPEAKER_16]: Kick that frecky fresh beat.

1346
01:33:30,729 --> 01:33:32,790
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, am I playing this other Kutimu clip here that we wanted to hear?

1347
01:33:32,810 --> 01:33:32,970
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

1348
01:33:58,365 --> 01:33:59,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1349
01:34:24,873 --> 01:34:26,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1350
01:34:53,195 --> 01:34:54,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Tirole, Tirole, Tirole, Tirole

1351
01:35:26,239 --> 01:35:30,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.

1352
01:35:31,545 --> 01:35:33,248
[SPEAKER_20]: Dude, that shit rocks.

1353
01:35:34,189 --> 01:35:35,590
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the first time I heard that.

1354
01:35:36,732 --> 01:35:40,016
[SPEAKER_28]: So, now is it true this guy's got a CD coming out, or what's the deal with this?

1355
01:35:40,652 --> 01:35:41,892
[SPEAKER_30]: It's not really a CD.

1356
01:35:41,952 --> 01:35:46,414
[SPEAKER_30]: He just makes supposed CDs, but they're just a bunch of MP3s that he has.

1357
01:35:47,294 --> 01:35:51,175
[SPEAKER_30]: He's doing a non-stop of his songs, and he's doing some new ones.

1358
01:35:51,235 --> 01:35:53,696
[SPEAKER_30]: I forget what was on the list of stuff to be done.

1359
01:35:54,416 --> 01:35:59,277
[SPEAKER_30]: If you could pull up our forums again, we can check that, because I actually wrote it down on there.

1360
01:36:06,701 --> 01:36:08,622
[SPEAKER_30]: But, uh, let's see here.

1361
01:36:09,182 --> 01:36:12,323
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, oh shit, I can't remember offhand what he was doing.

1362
01:36:12,343 --> 01:36:13,403
[SPEAKER_30]: There's some good ones.

1363
01:36:13,463 --> 01:36:16,144
[SPEAKER_30]: I think a lot of stuff from Beat Mania, if I remember correctly.

1364
01:36:16,764 --> 01:36:19,305
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, ah shit.

1365
01:36:20,346 --> 01:36:21,626
[SPEAKER_30]: Let me see here.

1366
01:36:21,826 --> 01:36:21,906
[SPEAKER_30]: Uh...

1367
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:32,661
[SPEAKER_30]: Let's see, he was going to be doing... Oh, here's some of the new tracks he's going to be doing.

1368
01:36:33,041 --> 01:36:37,923
[SPEAKER_30]: He's going to be doing another version of TTR.

1369
01:36:37,943 --> 01:36:40,963
[SPEAKER_30]: I guess that was... I have no idea.

1370
01:36:41,824 --> 01:36:46,765
[SPEAKER_30]: I think that's the Dance Dance Revolution song, the bonus song.

1371
01:36:47,605 --> 01:36:54,308
[SPEAKER_30]: Then he's going to be doing Y31, and he's also doing Butterfly as some of the other tracks coming out soon.

1372
01:36:55,228 --> 01:36:57,649
[SPEAKER_30]: So, yeah, that's it.

1373
01:36:58,749 --> 01:36:58,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1374
01:37:00,962 --> 01:37:02,603
[SPEAKER_30]: and his new CD, The Power of Mouth.

1375
01:37:03,424 --> 01:37:07,407
[SPEAKER_30]: Which also will be a pack of DWIs coming out soon.

1376
01:37:07,947 --> 01:37:08,167
[SPEAKER_30]: Maybe.

1377
01:37:09,348 --> 01:37:11,249
[SPEAKER_18]: The Power of Mouth sounds like an erotic title.

1378
01:37:11,290 --> 01:37:15,392
[SPEAKER_28]: I know, it sounds like pretty... That should have been one of those rejected erotic songs.

1379
01:37:16,833 --> 01:37:17,914
[SPEAKER_28]: We talked about it a couple weeks ago.

1380
01:37:20,716 --> 01:37:23,278
[SPEAKER_28]: Speaking of CD releases, topic change.

1381
01:37:24,499 --> 01:37:27,041
[SPEAKER_28]: Dance Mania is putting out a whole shitload of albums this month.

1382
01:37:28,330 --> 01:37:29,070
That series still exists?

1383
01:37:29,631 --> 01:37:30,611
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, believe it or not.

1384
01:37:31,051 --> 01:37:35,953
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, there's no... There's actually... No, the last one that came out was Dance Mania EX2.

1385
01:37:35,973 --> 01:37:38,674
[SPEAKER_28]: It was the last one that came out in the actual Dance Mania line.

1386
01:37:38,694 --> 01:37:44,476
[SPEAKER_28]: But a lot of these sister compilations... Well, let's think.

1387
01:37:44,536 --> 01:37:44,816
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's think.

1388
01:37:44,876 --> 01:37:45,476
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, there's been 10.

1389
01:37:46,136 --> 01:37:46,837
[SPEAKER_28]: There were 10 of them.

1390
01:37:46,917 --> 01:37:52,979
[SPEAKER_28]: No, there were 9 plus another 9, 18, were all the Xs and the ones without the X. And then...

1391
01:37:57,185 --> 01:38:03,008
[SPEAKER_28]: Right, okay, so there's 20, okay, right, yeah, there's 20, and then two more, 24, you're right.

1392
01:38:05,249 --> 01:38:11,692
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, so anyone, these are the new ones that are coming out very soon, or are already out in Japan, they're just not over here yet.

1393
01:38:12,692 --> 01:38:18,134
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, there's Base 11 Hyper Best, which is... Huh?

1394
01:38:18,355 --> 01:38:21,836
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't think there's any samples for this one, I... Where?

1395
01:38:22,076 --> 01:38:22,556
[SPEAKER_28]: Where's sample?

1396
01:38:22,937 --> 01:38:24,177
[SPEAKER_28]: No, it wasn't sample.

1397
01:38:24,918 --> 01:38:25,078
[SPEAKER_28]: Um...

1398
01:38:26,505 --> 01:38:30,406
[SPEAKER_28]: It has my baby mama on it, so you know this is more of like a best.

1399
01:38:30,726 --> 01:38:35,828
[SPEAKER_28]: There's Like A Virgin and Billie Jean.

1400
01:38:35,908 --> 01:38:36,928
[SPEAKER_28]: Best of Hardcore.

1401
01:38:37,428 --> 01:38:39,028
[SPEAKER_28]: Speed presents the Best of Hardcore.

1402
01:38:39,048 --> 01:38:40,029
[SPEAKER_18]: Now that has to be mine.

1403
01:38:40,929 --> 01:38:51,812
[SPEAKER_28]: It starts off with Triple J, Follow The Sun, and then goes into some other tracks, Let It Be, Time After Time, 99 Red Balloons, Heaven, Here Come The Noise.

1404
01:38:53,152 --> 01:38:54,693
[SPEAKER_28]: And then we have Trancemania 3.

1405
01:38:57,266 --> 01:38:58,507
[SPEAKER_28]: It has all sorts of interesting stuff.

1406
01:38:58,527 --> 01:38:59,909
[SPEAKER_28]: It has a group called the Porn Kings on it.

1407
01:39:00,169 --> 01:39:01,190
[SPEAKER_18]: Cool, I like them already.

1408
01:39:01,550 --> 01:39:04,552
[SPEAKER_28]: And then, of course, one more time we get Lasco is something.

1409
01:39:05,193 --> 01:39:08,696
[SPEAKER_28]: Jeez.

1410
01:39:09,016 --> 01:39:13,499
[SPEAKER_28]: Dance Dance Revolution Extreme, the official soundtrack, just came out on the 26th.

1411
01:39:15,821 --> 01:39:16,262
[SPEAKER_28]: March 26th?

1412
01:39:16,762 --> 01:39:18,263
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh yeah, how's it going?

1413
01:39:18,343 --> 01:39:19,144
[SPEAKER_18]: Gee, Rob.

1414
01:39:19,664 --> 01:39:21,206
[SPEAKER_18]: Get your chronology correct.

1415
01:39:21,506 --> 01:39:25,429
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, because I said that because I thought I had heard reports that it was released this week.

1416
01:39:27,970 --> 01:39:28,190
[SPEAKER_28]: I want!

1417
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:28,590
[SPEAKER_28]: I want!

1418
01:39:28,610 --> 01:39:32,551
[SPEAKER_28]: I want!

1419
01:39:53,536 --> 01:39:53,936
[SPEAKER_18]: I want.

1420
01:39:54,376 --> 01:39:55,457
[SPEAKER_28]: And it has my fire again.

1421
01:39:55,477 --> 01:39:56,577
[SPEAKER_28]: It has my fire on it twice.

1422
01:39:56,837 --> 01:39:57,077
[SPEAKER_18]: Gimme.

1423
01:39:57,237 --> 01:39:58,157
[SPEAKER_28]: No, no, it was just once.

1424
01:39:58,217 --> 01:39:58,537
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry.

1425
01:39:58,917 --> 01:39:59,237
[SPEAKER_18]: Gimme.

1426
01:40:00,258 --> 01:40:02,358
[SPEAKER_28]: You gotta go to Dance Media and get some.

1427
01:40:03,158 --> 01:40:03,578
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't care.

1428
01:40:03,658 --> 01:40:04,579
[SPEAKER_18]: My birthday is next month.

1429
01:40:04,599 --> 01:40:05,279
[SPEAKER_18]: Someone buy that for me.

1430
01:40:05,299 --> 01:40:07,419
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, and that comes out on the 29th.

1431
01:40:07,479 --> 01:40:08,840
[SPEAKER_18]: I want actually Best of Hardcore instead.

1432
01:40:08,900 --> 01:40:09,320
[SPEAKER_28]: And what's this?

1433
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:10,060
[SPEAKER_28]: Disco Party 2.

1434
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:11,140
[SPEAKER_28]: I guess it's a video.

1435
01:40:11,160 --> 01:40:11,980
[SPEAKER_18]: Super Disco Party.

1436
01:40:13,381 --> 01:40:16,061
[SPEAKER_28]: So is disco replacing Parapar or something?

1437
01:40:16,101 --> 01:40:18,102
[SPEAKER_28]: Is that why they got all these new videos and shit coming out?

1438
01:40:20,307 --> 01:40:28,393
[SPEAKER_18]: How to Disco, you shake your ass I need to download that

1439
01:40:42,304 --> 01:40:47,148
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm actually downloading Battle Royale, but I'm trying to find the special edition online.

1440
01:40:48,229 --> 01:40:49,870
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I need a special edition.

1441
01:40:50,411 --> 01:40:52,152
[SPEAKER_18]: I need, you know, extra scenes of death.

1442
01:40:54,594 --> 01:40:55,095
[SPEAKER_18]: That's it.

1443
01:40:55,175 --> 01:40:59,338
[SPEAKER_18]: Someone needs to do a music video to Battle Royale.

1444
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:05,824
[SPEAKER_18]: And then do, for the song, is Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.

1445
01:41:08,996 --> 01:41:16,260
[SPEAKER_30]: You know, not to like, you know, travel back in time here, but, um, I don't know, DWI contest?

1446
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:19,421
[SPEAKER_30]: We just kind of, poof, forgot about?

1447
01:41:19,921 --> 01:41:21,702
Yes, speak on this.

1448
01:41:22,782 --> 01:41:24,163
[SPEAKER_30]: I ain't speaking shit on this.

1449
01:41:24,263 --> 01:41:28,805
[SPEAKER_30]: I got enough stuff to do with Rain and Website and doing God knows what other stuff.

1450
01:41:30,186 --> 01:41:32,607
[SPEAKER_20]: This DWI contest, does that involve alcohol?

1451
01:41:34,551 --> 01:41:48,737
[SPEAKER_18]: For Stepmania, we are having a contest where pick a TV song, not a remixed version, not a long version, just a TV theme song, and make steps for it.

1452
01:41:52,258 --> 01:41:59,481
[SPEAKER_30]: We have one for Mr. Rogers, and it's kind of stupid.

1453
01:42:01,542 --> 01:42:03,463
[SPEAKER_18]: I personally want to see one for Two Stupid Dogs.

1454
01:42:06,292 --> 01:42:09,454
[SPEAKER_18]: You've seen Two Super Dogs, right?

1455
01:42:09,614 --> 01:42:10,355
[SPEAKER_18]: That shit was cool.

1456
01:42:11,695 --> 01:42:15,077
[SPEAKER_18]: I want one for Two Super Dogs.

1457
01:42:15,337 --> 01:42:18,539
[SPEAKER_18]: And for Freakazoid.

1458
01:42:19,099 --> 01:42:20,180
[SPEAKER_29]: I made one for Funky Brewster.

1459
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:21,721
[SPEAKER_29]: It's so slow.

1460
01:42:23,422 --> 01:42:24,242
[SPEAKER_18]: So do it in double speed.

1461
01:42:27,133 --> 01:42:30,594
[SPEAKER_30]: No, she's not.

1462
01:42:30,634 --> 01:42:31,734
[SPEAKER_29]: She got her reduction.

1463
01:42:36,576 --> 01:42:39,577
[SPEAKER_29]: She looked pretty hot in the Pumpkinhead movies, though.

1464
01:42:40,617 --> 01:42:52,100
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, first of all, I want to know what you think is more attractive, having really huge boobs and walking with a hunch, or having not as big boobs but still big and walking upright?

1465
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:52,460
Big.

1466
01:42:53,856 --> 01:42:56,037
[SPEAKER_30]: This is where you think you're going to get me, but you're wrong.

1467
01:42:56,477 --> 01:42:58,137
[SPEAKER_30]: I didn't say big boobs at all.

1468
01:42:58,317 --> 01:42:59,317
[SPEAKER_30]: I said she got boobs.

1469
01:43:00,057 --> 01:43:01,938
[SPEAKER_30]: Firm breasts are what's good.

1470
01:43:02,258 --> 01:43:03,958
[SPEAKER_30]: Firm breasts are the greatest.

1471
01:43:04,238 --> 01:43:06,939
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't care if they have to be huge or what, but firm.

1472
01:43:07,239 --> 01:43:10,099
[SPEAKER_30]: Firm breasts are what is awesome, okay?

1473
01:43:11,199 --> 01:43:13,420
[SPEAKER_20]: If I'm allowed to touch them, it doesn't matter.

1474
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:18,501
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, were you breastfed as a baby or not?

1475
01:43:20,313 --> 01:43:23,297
[SPEAKER_30]: Wasn't, like, practically everyone on the face of the earth, pretty much.

1476
01:43:23,458 --> 01:43:23,638
[SPEAKER_30]: No.

1477
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:25,340
[SPEAKER_30]: We'll see.

1478
01:43:25,521 --> 01:43:27,043
[SPEAKER_30]: We know how you... Yeah.

1479
01:43:28,265 --> 01:43:29,186
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you an 80s child?

1480
01:43:30,548 --> 01:43:31,890
[SPEAKER_18]: I was when my mom used to cloth diapers.

1481
01:43:34,233 --> 01:43:35,415
[SPEAKER_18]: I was a natural child.

1482
01:43:38,234 --> 01:43:41,196
[SPEAKER_16]: I was told I was breastfed, but I refused it.

1483
01:43:43,278 --> 01:43:51,884
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, but... My sister, they tried to breastfeed her and she was allergic to natural milk.

1484
01:43:53,004 --> 01:43:53,865
[SPEAKER_18]: So it would make her sick.

1485
01:43:56,107 --> 01:43:56,947
[SPEAKER_18]: How does that suck?

1486
01:43:58,448 --> 01:43:59,049
[SPEAKER_29]: Like a baby.

1487
01:44:01,050 --> 01:44:05,473
[SPEAKER_29]: Like, um, basically when it comes to a girl, I don't want knee slappers, you know?

1488
01:44:06,094 --> 01:44:07,815
[SPEAKER_29]: I want them to sit where they're supposed to sit.

1489
01:44:10,322 --> 01:44:11,183
[SPEAKER_18]: What on your face?

1490
01:44:12,545 --> 01:44:14,927
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, that seemed a bit too serious for me.

1491
01:44:14,947 --> 01:44:15,928
[SPEAKER_29]: What, what on your face?

1492
01:44:18,071 --> 01:44:20,053
[SPEAKER_29]: Alright, or anywhere else they need to sit.

1493
01:44:20,595 --> 01:44:23,917
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, since he was being us, no, size does matter a little bit.

1494
01:44:24,157 --> 01:44:25,138
[SPEAKER_20]: No knee slappers.

1495
01:44:25,218 --> 01:44:27,880
[SPEAKER_20]: They need to kind of have somewhat of a firmness.

1496
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:30,602
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, you don't want them going below the belly button, right?

1497
01:44:30,742 --> 01:44:33,023
[SPEAKER_29]: No, really, actually, size is the huge thing.

1498
01:44:33,123 --> 01:44:37,106
[SPEAKER_29]: I just don't want, like, when you're going to be 60, they're going to be hanging down to your knees.

1499
01:44:38,127 --> 01:44:42,970
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't want you looking like some freaking huge freak with these giant breasts that look like God knows what.

1500
01:44:43,751 --> 01:44:48,454
[SPEAKER_30]: And I also don't want you looking like a little boy, so... No, a little boy in J-Cups.

1501
01:44:51,278 --> 01:44:52,139
[SPEAKER_30]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1502
01:45:08,035 --> 01:45:11,756
[SPEAKER_20]: And the Spice Channel presents the brand new Double O Size Bra

1503
01:45:26,974 --> 01:45:46,945
[SPEAKER_30]: But you know what's weird, though, is, like, okay, because I took a picture with these two chicks when we went to the Easy Rider Bike Show, and they're, like, some of the models, and they basically, for the pictures, they sit in your lap, which is really sweet, but their breasts were, like, up against my chest, and it just, like, felt weird, because it was, like, unnaturally firm.

1504
01:45:46,985 --> 01:45:47,425
[SPEAKER_30]: It was, like...

1505
01:45:48,712 --> 01:45:58,235
[SPEAKER_30]: Not rocks, but like, it's like, they're these like, um, balls I've seen where they're kind of like, you know, those inflatable beach ball type things.

1506
01:45:59,435 --> 01:46:03,836
[SPEAKER_30]: But they're like, they're a little bit firm, but it feels like an over-inflated beach ball.

1507
01:46:03,936 --> 01:46:05,756
[SPEAKER_20]: I think they need to have their sailing changed.

1508
01:46:06,557 --> 01:46:06,797
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.

1509
01:46:07,617 --> 01:46:15,039
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, what I think is incredibly stupid is there's these, um, and they're mostly novelty models, it's true.

1510
01:46:15,914 --> 01:46:20,916
[SPEAKER_18]: This was a lot back when I was still in high school, watching Geraldo or something, one of those talk shows.

1511
01:46:21,856 --> 01:46:26,318
[SPEAKER_18]: And they had these women on there who had had their chests enlarged to G-size and up.

1512
01:46:27,278 --> 01:46:31,100
[SPEAKER_18]: And seriously, each boob was like the size of a small country.

1513
01:46:32,100 --> 01:46:36,702
[SPEAKER_18]: It was like the size of a... They could have dropped those boobs on Iraq.

1514
01:46:37,142 --> 01:46:41,444
[SPEAKER_18]: Not quite as big as Quaid, I'm thinking more like... Like Nixon's sign.

1515
01:46:43,718 --> 01:46:45,759
[SPEAKER_18]: But they were huge.

1516
01:46:45,779 --> 01:46:49,681
[SPEAKER_18]: They're going to need back braces when they're 50.

1517
01:46:49,761 --> 01:47:02,088
[SPEAKER_08]: If they had their spine out of steel, then maybe that might work.

1518
01:47:03,069 --> 01:47:08,052
[SPEAKER_28]: Usually I would be surprised that y'all could talk about her breasts for so long, but then I remember what show I'm on.

1519
01:47:14,042 --> 01:47:15,883
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't you have a fascination with boobs?

1520
01:47:15,923 --> 01:47:16,884
[SPEAKER_28]: Boobs are interesting.

1521
01:47:18,284 --> 01:47:19,645
[SPEAKER_28]: I wouldn't want them for myself.

1522
01:47:21,806 --> 01:47:22,987
[SPEAKER_28]: But yeah, boobs are funny.

1523
01:47:24,088 --> 01:47:25,769
[SPEAKER_28]: Boobs are the punchline to a good joke.

1524
01:47:26,789 --> 01:47:27,690
[SPEAKER_28]: Knock, knock, who's there?

1525
01:47:27,730 --> 01:47:28,130
[SPEAKER_28]: Boobs!

1526
01:47:29,031 --> 01:47:29,511
[SPEAKER_20]: Sweet.

1527
01:47:32,372 --> 01:47:34,574
[SPEAKER_28]: On that note, why don't we get to this week's cage match?

1528
01:47:34,594 --> 01:47:35,294
[SPEAKER_28]: What do you guys think?

1529
01:47:38,076 --> 01:47:38,856
[SPEAKER_18]: I won last week.

1530
01:47:39,056 --> 01:47:39,837
[SPEAKER_20]: What's a cage match?

1531
01:47:40,517 --> 01:47:41,418
[SPEAKER_18]: We pick songs.

1532
01:47:42,818 --> 01:47:43,659
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, I'm a noob.

1533
01:47:45,431 --> 01:47:48,872
[SPEAKER_18]: Not me!

1534
01:47:51,732 --> 01:47:55,033
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, the cage match is where we each pick a song.

1535
01:47:56,153 --> 01:48:00,054
[SPEAKER_18]: And since we've been into it, one of us will have won last week, so our song remains over.

1536
01:48:00,954 --> 01:48:02,755
[SPEAKER_18]: So the other two people will bring in a new song.

1537
01:48:03,235 --> 01:48:07,816
[SPEAKER_18]: And chatroom votes on what they think is the best song, but we go around and rate it, sort of, you know, American Idol style.

1538
01:48:09,236 --> 01:48:12,797
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, usually with our generous person here.

1539
01:48:13,517 --> 01:48:14,097
[SPEAKER_18]: This, the...

1540
01:48:15,629 --> 01:48:18,391
[SPEAKER_18]: Bipolar Person here, and the Super Cynic.

1541
01:48:20,292 --> 01:48:22,013
[SPEAKER_18]: So, um, yeah, Cynic, you.

1542
01:48:24,855 --> 01:48:26,897
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and then our chatroom gets to vote.

1543
01:48:27,277 --> 01:48:28,298
[SPEAKER_18]: We vote after all the songs are played.

1544
01:48:28,638 --> 01:48:30,339
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm special because I won last week.

1545
01:48:30,619 --> 01:48:33,861
[SPEAKER_18]: But they hated my song from the week before, so we voted it off the island, and I picked a new one.

1546
01:48:35,062 --> 01:48:38,965
[SPEAKER_28]: So... Alright, so we're getting to this week?

1547
01:48:39,565 --> 01:48:40,306
[SPEAKER_30]: Alright, real quick.

1548
01:48:40,566 --> 01:48:40,786
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

1549
01:48:40,946 --> 01:48:43,428
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck you with obscure Survivor references.

1550
01:48:43,728 --> 01:48:44,569
[SPEAKER_20]: Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1551
01:48:46,201 --> 01:48:50,665
[SPEAKER_30]: So, uh, like, um, yeah, I've got my track and everything, but I've got two.

1552
01:48:51,105 --> 01:48:54,548
[SPEAKER_30]: So do you guys want to hear a house track or a trance track?

1553
01:48:54,949 --> 01:48:56,670
[SPEAKER_28]: A house track or a trance?

1554
01:48:56,690 --> 01:49:00,153
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you want to let the chat room decide?

1555
01:49:00,173 --> 01:49:01,014
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you want to let us decide?

1556
01:49:01,034 --> 01:49:01,434
[SPEAKER_28]: Opera trance.

1557
01:49:02,575 --> 01:49:09,922
[SPEAKER_30]: We have, we have, we have either, like, sort of disco-y, but really hard house, um, track, or we've got opera trance.

1558
01:49:10,582 --> 01:49:10,903
[SPEAKER_10]: Mmm.

1559
01:49:10,923 --> 01:49:11,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Mmm.

1560
01:49:14,737 --> 01:49:17,679
[SPEAKER_28]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1561
01:49:39,727 --> 01:49:40,728
[SPEAKER_28]: Thanks for watching!

1562
01:50:38,902 --> 01:50:39,843
[SPEAKER_28]: Beatbox with What A Wonderful World

1563
01:51:10,283 --> 01:51:11,063
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, enjoy.

1564
01:51:11,103 --> 01:51:12,784
[SPEAKER_28]: This is Loki's pick.

1565
01:51:12,804 --> 01:51:13,584
[SPEAKER_28]: The title one more time?

1566
01:51:13,724 --> 01:51:14,685
[SPEAKER_30]: Spente La Style.

1567
01:51:14,765 --> 01:51:15,605
[SPEAKER_28]: Spente La Style.

1568
01:51:15,645 --> 01:51:18,327
[SPEAKER_28]: Or if you just want to vote for it, you can call it Opera Trance.

1569
01:51:18,387 --> 01:51:20,728
[SPEAKER_28]: But remember, you can't vote until we've played all three songs.

1570
01:51:20,768 --> 01:51:22,029
[SPEAKER_28]: So here's the Opera Trance song.

1571
01:53:11,488 --> 01:53:15,710
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

1572
01:54:52,185 --> 01:54:57,086
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, that was Spente Le Stelle from Opera Trance.

1573
01:54:58,927 --> 01:55:02,328
[SPEAKER_28]: And by the way, that song is also on Dance Mania 20, did you know that?

1574
01:55:03,128 --> 01:55:03,508
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, it is.

1575
01:55:04,208 --> 01:55:05,629
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway, that's kind of neat.

1576
01:55:06,569 --> 01:55:07,589
[SPEAKER_28]: So, goodnight.

1577
01:55:08,810 --> 01:55:09,890
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, so here we go.

1578
01:55:10,470 --> 01:55:11,150
[SPEAKER_28]: What did you guys think of that?

1579
01:55:11,190 --> 01:55:11,671
[SPEAKER_28]: Go around the room.

1580
01:55:12,071 --> 01:55:13,611
[SPEAKER_18]: It's cool, and I liked it once it picked up.

1581
01:55:13,691 --> 01:55:14,251
[SPEAKER_18]: It gives an 8.

1582
01:55:16,752 --> 01:55:17,312
[SPEAKER_16]: I like it.

1583
01:55:17,372 --> 01:55:18,412
[SPEAKER_16]: I give it a 9.

1584
01:55:18,593 --> 01:55:19,953
[SPEAKER_16]: I like opera stuff like that.

1585
01:55:21,405 --> 01:55:25,667
[SPEAKER_30]: It reminds me of like techno mafia music, so I give it a 10.

1586
01:55:27,707 --> 01:55:29,828
[SPEAKER_20]: I second that techno mafia stuff.

1587
01:55:30,288 --> 01:55:31,209
[SPEAKER_20]: I give it 10 as well.

1588
01:55:32,649 --> 01:55:34,830
[SPEAKER_29]: I was severely disappointed so much I gave it a 10.

1589
01:55:37,461 --> 01:55:38,521
[SPEAKER_28]: It was okay, seven.

1590
01:55:41,882 --> 01:55:42,222
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

1591
01:55:42,842 --> 01:55:48,243
[SPEAKER_28]: I have a little bit of backstory to my pick, because I know I'm going to get shit for this, but I don't care.

1592
01:55:48,463 --> 01:55:55,805
[SPEAKER_28]: Because everybody tells me I never can pick a song that wins, so I figure, fine, I'm going to go over the deep end this week.

1593
01:55:56,625 --> 01:56:00,866
[SPEAKER_28]: But I decided that, you know, everybody says, oh, you've got to pick something from SyFam.

1594
01:56:00,886 --> 01:56:01,806
[SPEAKER_28]: That's how you're going to win this.

1595
01:56:01,846 --> 01:56:02,987
[SPEAKER_28]: You pick something from SyFam.

1596
01:56:03,407 --> 01:56:03,627
[SPEAKER_28]: So...

1597
01:56:04,467 --> 01:56:32,240
[SPEAKER_28]: I asked JB, oh give me a song from Syafam that's sure to win it And he said, you know what Rob, this song's very you And I think you'll like it, so I'm going to put this in the cage match tonight And this is DJ Speedo featuring Wild Side And Wild Side is, as you know, the group that did Irresistible Mint from DDR Extreme And the song is called Asoreje But you might know it as a different name And I'm so going to die, but I don't care

1598
01:56:33,543 --> 01:56:35,014
[SPEAKER_28]: So, enjoy!

1599
01:59:48,621 --> 01:59:50,444
DarkSakura.com

1600
02:01:16,144 --> 02:01:18,146
[SPEAKER_28]: That song makes me want to go to RBGL and murder children.

1601
02:01:18,186 --> 02:01:18,846
[SPEAKER_28]: I give it a minus 58.

1602
02:01:18,886 --> 02:01:19,527
[SPEAKER_28]: I give it shit.

1603
02:01:39,994 --> 02:01:43,617
[SPEAKER_17]: Aw, that song was pretty poofy, pretty poofy.

1604
02:01:43,657 --> 02:01:46,018
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, hey, haha, let's give it a two.

1605
02:01:48,656 --> 02:01:52,857
[SPEAKER_17]: Wait, we've got a little... Oh, okay, we've got a curling event.

1606
02:01:53,597 --> 02:01:54,657
[SPEAKER_17]: MoCap curling!

1607
02:01:56,077 --> 02:01:57,098
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello, Cage Match song.

1608
02:01:57,458 --> 02:02:08,540
[SPEAKER_17]: Jason has got a vacuum cleaner head thing, and we've got a little ball rolling, and Mike's rolling the ball, and Jason is vacuuming the floor ahead of the ball.

1609
02:02:09,700 --> 02:02:10,360
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.

1610
02:02:10,480 --> 02:02:12,660
[SPEAKER_17]: Back to Cage Match, Loki.

1611
02:02:12,801 --> 02:02:14,301
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, here's Loki.

1612
02:02:16,252 --> 02:02:18,513
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, this song violated so many rules.

1613
02:02:18,573 --> 02:02:21,194
[SPEAKER_30]: Number one, being a ketchup song, it sucked ass.

1614
02:02:21,394 --> 02:02:23,975
[SPEAKER_30]: Number two, it was a speed mix, which really sucks ass.

1615
02:02:24,495 --> 02:02:27,577
[SPEAKER_30]: And number three, I'm mad at Syfan right now, so that also sucked ass.

1616
02:02:28,477 --> 02:02:30,618
[SPEAKER_30]: So I give the song an A for 100, but the curling gets a 10.

1617
02:02:35,908 --> 02:02:49,475
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, um, I hate that song just because it sounds too much like Happy Hardcore to me, and I can't stand Little Candy Kids, so I'm gonna give it a 3, because it had a decent beat to it, so 3.

1618
02:02:52,156 --> 02:02:53,296
[SPEAKER_28]: Asian innovation.

1619
02:02:55,498 --> 02:02:58,019
[SPEAKER_26]: Seeing that I left the room because the song sucks so much...

1620
02:02:59,105 --> 02:03:02,308
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll give it a, out of a scale of 1 to 10, I'll give it a suck.

1621
02:03:04,149 --> 02:03:08,833
[SPEAKER_24]: And, uh, of course, my pick, um, I thought it was wonderful, a 10, alright.

1622
02:03:11,335 --> 02:03:12,696
[SPEAKER_24]: That balance is out to suck, doesn't it?

1623
02:03:12,716 --> 02:03:14,538
[SPEAKER_28]: And fuck all you who can't take a joke, alright.

1624
02:03:14,558 --> 02:03:16,159
[SPEAKER_29]: You sure are a damn liar.

1625
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:16,600
[SPEAKER_29]: And...

1626
02:03:17,220 --> 02:03:20,261
[SPEAKER_28]: and Jamie gets a zero for hitting me in the nose with a ball.

1627
02:03:21,101 --> 02:03:21,701
[SPEAKER_29]: I gave it a ten.

1628
02:03:21,721 --> 02:03:23,861
[SPEAKER_28]: Now I have to get a new nose like Cher, Jesus.

1629
02:03:23,961 --> 02:03:24,761
[SPEAKER_29]: I gave that a ten.

1630
02:03:24,861 --> 02:03:25,141
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

1631
02:03:25,822 --> 02:03:29,122
[SPEAKER_17]: Ron, I thought you'd be happy by getting me hit in the nose with a ball.

1632
02:03:29,142 --> 02:03:31,623
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's review what you can pick tonight, shall we?

1633
02:03:32,483 --> 02:03:39,824
[SPEAKER_28]: The first one that you can pick, and I have to I have to queue it up because I accidentally got rid of the CD.

1634
02:03:39,844 --> 02:03:41,564
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, here's the first one you can vote for.

1635
02:03:41,644 --> 02:03:42,144
[SPEAKER_28]: Here's a clip.

1636
02:03:42,524 --> 02:03:44,785
[SPEAKER_28]: Beatbox with What a Wonderful World, last week's winner.

1637
02:03:44,805 --> 02:03:45,645
[SPEAKER_28]: And now the

1638
02:03:55,248 --> 02:03:59,313
[SPEAKER_28]: Second one you can vote for, this is Spente La Stelle, also known as Opera Trance.

1639
02:03:59,673 --> 02:04:00,314
[SPEAKER_28]: You can vote for that.

1640
02:04:10,086 --> 02:04:15,172
[SPEAKER_28]: Also you can vote for DJ Speedo featuring Wild Side with Asareje, also known as the Catch-Up Song.

1641
02:04:25,089 --> 02:04:26,611
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, you can vote for any one of those three.

1642
02:04:26,692 --> 02:04:30,838
[SPEAKER_28]: Just send your votes right now over private message in the chat room to Sky.

1643
02:04:31,299 --> 02:04:32,681
[SPEAKER_28]: If you vote for that, we will kill you.

1644
02:04:32,701 --> 02:04:36,166
[SPEAKER_28]: And then we'll tally up those votes and let you know who wins a little later in the show.

1645
02:04:36,206 --> 02:04:37,849
[SPEAKER_28]: And goddamn, I hope I win finally.

1646
02:04:40,791 --> 02:04:43,452
[SPEAKER_28]: I think there's a lot of people vote for me just because they feel sorry for me.

1647
02:04:43,993 --> 02:04:45,153
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't feel sorry for Rob.

1648
02:04:45,293 --> 02:04:46,774
[SPEAKER_28]: This is the week I want to win.

1649
02:04:47,634 --> 02:04:49,896
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't feel sorry for Rob.

1650
02:04:49,936 --> 02:04:55,538
[SPEAKER_18]: Just keep in mind, if you vote for that song, you have to hear it for two weeks.

1651
02:04:55,678 --> 02:04:57,739
[SPEAKER_24]: That's right, because there's no show next week.

1652
02:04:58,039 --> 02:05:00,841
[SPEAKER_24]: So whatever wins tonight is two weeks.

1653
02:05:02,142 --> 02:05:04,385
[SPEAKER_18]: So choose wisely.

1654
02:05:04,505 --> 02:05:05,907
[SPEAKER_18]: Or we'll kill you.

1655
02:05:05,927 --> 02:05:06,128
[SPEAKER_28]: My ball.

1656
02:05:06,148 --> 02:05:06,368
[SPEAKER_18]: My ball.

1657
02:05:06,388 --> 02:05:06,708
[SPEAKER_18]: My ball.

1658
02:05:06,728 --> 02:05:06,989
[SPEAKER_18]: My ball.

1659
02:05:19,705 --> 02:05:25,173
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, your song sucked so horribly we had to entertain ourselves and everyone else who was suffering in this room.

1660
02:05:25,793 --> 02:05:26,474
[SPEAKER_20]: So we were curling.

1661
02:05:27,396 --> 02:05:28,978
[SPEAKER_20]: It's an Olympic sport.

1662
02:05:29,258 --> 02:05:35,727
[SPEAKER_26]: It doesn't get as much recognition as the other sports, but it's pretty hard because...

1663
02:05:37,208 --> 02:05:39,670
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, you have to be really athletic to be a curler.

1664
02:05:40,430 --> 02:05:43,153
[SPEAKER_26]: Especially in the Olympics, because you have this broom, right?

1665
02:05:44,133 --> 02:05:45,935
[SPEAKER_26]: And you kind of need to know how to skate.

1666
02:05:47,096 --> 02:05:50,679
[SPEAKER_20]: And then you also... They have the ice shoes on, but it's still hard.

1667
02:05:50,779 --> 02:05:59,886
[SPEAKER_21]: And you have to, like, you know... You gotta keep ahead of whatever... You have to keep ahead of the mallet ball thingy, hockey puck thing they do.

1668
02:05:59,966 --> 02:06:00,126
[SPEAKER_26]: Right.

1669
02:06:01,227 --> 02:06:03,829
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, and pretty much it's like a big lead weight.

1670
02:06:04,049 --> 02:06:11,054
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, for all you curling fans out there, you have to, you know, depending on how fast, you have to get this target at the end.

1671
02:06:11,474 --> 02:06:14,296
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sweating my ass off and we just curled twice and it was only like 10 feet.

1672
02:06:14,476 --> 02:06:19,820
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, and you know, you basically have to use the broom to reduce or increase the friction.

1673
02:06:19,900 --> 02:06:21,001
[SPEAKER_26]: It's kind of weird, you know.

1674
02:06:21,421 --> 02:06:22,061
[SPEAKER_26]: Simple point.

1675
02:06:22,101 --> 02:06:27,325
[SPEAKER_26]: But yeah, the brooms are, only if hockey was played with brooms.

1676
02:06:28,050 --> 02:06:29,892
[SPEAKER_26]: Man, the puck would go so much faster.

1677
02:06:30,312 --> 02:06:32,415
[SPEAKER_29]: Simple point, it's a Canadian sport.

1678
02:06:33,456 --> 02:06:37,059
[SPEAKER_20]: Just remember, look for me in Asian Innovation in the next Winter Olympics.

1679
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:40,102
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll be trying to represent Sacramento.

1680
02:06:40,403 --> 02:06:45,167
[SPEAKER_21]: Team Sacramento, curling, 2008, in Beijing when they have no ice.

1681
02:06:47,049 --> 02:06:47,450
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's go.

1682
02:06:47,990 --> 02:06:49,892
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, you missed the show a couple weeks ago.

1683
02:06:49,912 --> 02:06:53,075
[SPEAKER_28]: We were talking about different mocap games that they can make.

1684
02:06:53,315 --> 02:06:54,276
[SPEAKER_28]: Mocap curling!

1685
02:06:54,296 --> 02:06:55,497
[SPEAKER_28]: Mocap curling.

1686
02:06:55,537 --> 02:06:55,597
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes!

1687
02:06:55,617 --> 02:06:56,518
[SPEAKER_28]: That was brought up.

1688
02:06:58,039 --> 02:07:00,822
[SPEAKER_28]: We did a list list, which we'll hopefully get to a list list segment tonight.

1689
02:07:00,842 --> 02:07:01,122
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

1690
02:07:01,442 --> 02:07:05,026
[SPEAKER_28]: Although I'm thinking, you know, instead of list lists, you know what we haven't done in a long time?

1691
02:07:05,726 --> 02:07:06,967
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's do a Bomani match game tonight.

1692
02:07:06,987 --> 02:07:07,488
[SPEAKER_28]: What do you guys think?

1693
02:07:10,034 --> 02:07:10,655
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, you wanna do that?

1694
02:07:10,815 --> 02:07:12,096
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, we'll do my money match game tonight.

1695
02:07:12,476 --> 02:07:13,697
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm a noob, you'll have to explain again.

1696
02:07:13,717 --> 02:07:15,298
[SPEAKER_28]: That's alright, I can explain it to you guys.

1697
02:07:16,279 --> 02:07:16,819
[SPEAKER_28]: I can do that.

1698
02:07:17,620 --> 02:07:20,782
[SPEAKER_20]: If I can find match game theme on my computer somewhere, I hope so.

1699
02:07:23,704 --> 02:07:26,947
[SPEAKER_20]: I could just come up with some porn themes off the top of my head.

1700
02:07:28,228 --> 02:07:29,729
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll end the show with Ask Orange Lounge.

1701
02:07:30,049 --> 02:07:30,670
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll do that later.

1702
02:07:33,252 --> 02:07:35,473
[SPEAKER_28]: So, but we'll get to that in a little bit.

1703
02:07:36,254 --> 02:07:38,816
[SPEAKER_27]: Because I have to have time to write up questions, so we have to take a break before we go to that.

1704
02:07:40,732 --> 02:07:43,255
[SPEAKER_27]: I think he's going to want a filler because he's typing stuff right now.

1705
02:07:43,275 --> 02:07:44,156
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, we need a filler.

1706
02:07:44,456 --> 02:07:46,839
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, let's go more porn music.

1707
02:07:46,959 --> 02:07:47,840
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm too white for this.

1708
02:08:03,186 --> 02:08:30,375
[SPEAKER_30]: I'M GERMAN FOR GOD'S SAKE WE DON'T MAKE PEOPLE LAUGH THIS REMINDS ME EXCUSIVE REMIX, REMIX FREAKIN' MOVIE, MALMOO'S MOST WANTED SUCKS ASS THAT MOVIE SUCKS ASS WHAT IS THE MOST IMPLICATING STUPID PIECE THAT SUCKS ASS BUT NOT THE GOOD MOVIES LIKE BUBBA HOTEP FUCK YOU, FUCK YOU ASIAN BEATBOXERS THAT CAN'T DO IT RIGHT

1709
02:08:32,199 --> 02:08:35,722
[SPEAKER_28]: That was the beauty of silence, um, Fox Remix.

1710
02:08:35,782 --> 02:08:38,284
[SPEAKER_28]: They're having, they have a request for some impromptu tumu.

1711
02:08:39,004 --> 02:08:40,045
[SPEAKER_28]: You wanna do, want some?

1712
02:08:41,606 --> 02:08:43,047
[SPEAKER_28]: The, the, you know, talking.

1713
02:08:46,630 --> 02:08:56,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

1714
02:09:00,579 --> 02:09:01,519
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, my dear good Lord.

1715
02:09:03,720 --> 02:09:06,161
[SPEAKER_28]: I think now would be a very good time to take a break.

1716
02:09:06,201 --> 02:09:09,122
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, if you haven't sent in your votes already, there's not that many votes.

1717
02:09:10,062 --> 02:09:17,564
[SPEAKER_23]: There's not that many votes in right now for Cage Match.

1718
02:09:18,984 --> 02:09:23,145
[SPEAKER_28]: There's not that many votes in right now for Cage Match, which is, you know what happens when nobody votes?

1719
02:09:23,426 --> 02:09:25,246
[SPEAKER_28]: The underdog wins.

1720
02:09:28,007 --> 02:09:28,287
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

1721
02:09:29,093 --> 02:09:31,374
[SPEAKER_18]: When no one votes, we gang up on Robin, then we win.

1722
02:09:31,394 --> 02:09:41,801
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, if the underdog wins, I put zero votes, zero points for that opera trance, because it sucked ass, and I give ten to that crappy ass, sappy, hardcore wannabe shit.

1723
02:09:42,421 --> 02:09:48,264
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, so we'll be back after this quick break, and we'll talk about some Babani Match Game and your cage match winner.

1724
02:09:48,384 --> 02:09:49,205
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll be back!

1725
02:10:15,339 --> 02:10:17,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Where were you to hold my hand?

1726
02:10:18,023 --> 02:10:28,938
[SPEAKER_10]: To the things that we have planned Yes, I need you by my side When things go crazy I just need to know you care

1727
02:11:31,756 --> 02:11:32,257
Thanks for watching!

1728
02:12:43,842 --> 02:12:44,417
Thanks for watching!

1729
02:13:14,719 --> 02:13:15,160
Thanks for watching!

1730
02:18:04,461 --> 02:18:08,704
[SPEAKER_30]: Welcome to Orange Lunch Radio, where love is orange.

1731
02:18:09,605 --> 02:18:11,085
[SPEAKER_30]: Shaving monkeys is always permitted.

1732
02:18:12,226 --> 02:18:12,666
[SPEAKER_30]: Just kidding.

1733
02:18:12,946 --> 02:18:21,371
[SPEAKER_18]: But... But it's... You scare the monkey, you don't come in.

1734
02:18:21,471 --> 02:18:23,593
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no, I'll just bring Shermie.

1735
02:18:26,280 --> 02:18:27,921
[SPEAKER_31]: If Shermie doesn't like you, leave.

1736
02:18:28,282 --> 02:18:31,824
[SPEAKER_31]: A proceeding, as always, was brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.

1737
02:18:33,045 --> 02:18:34,666
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello again.

1738
02:18:35,707 --> 02:18:36,247
[SPEAKER_28]: We're back.

1739
02:18:36,367 --> 02:18:37,448
[SPEAKER_18]: The monkey sling poo.

1740
02:18:38,008 --> 02:18:40,570
[SPEAKER_28]: And I bet you'd love to know who won the cage match.

1741
02:18:42,611 --> 02:18:43,772
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, it was very close.

1742
02:18:43,812 --> 02:18:44,552
[SPEAKER_28]: And you know what's funny?

1743
02:18:44,612 --> 02:18:46,374
[SPEAKER_28]: We had a vote for Oprah Trance.

1744
02:18:47,816 --> 02:18:49,318
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I bet Oprah's glad to hear that.

1745
02:18:49,378 --> 02:18:50,339
[SPEAKER_18]: She needs to listen.

1746
02:18:50,359 --> 02:18:55,765
[SPEAKER_28]: But, I hate to say this, but it did win by one vote.

1747
02:18:56,386 --> 02:19:00,490
[SPEAKER_28]: It won by one stinking vote.

1748
02:19:00,711 --> 02:19:02,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Ha ha, ha ha.

1749
02:19:04,174 --> 02:19:05,996
[SPEAKER_28]: The chatroom conspired again.

1750
02:19:06,097 --> 02:19:07,138
[SPEAKER_28]: Oprah Trance won it.

1751
02:19:09,008 --> 02:19:11,369
[SPEAKER_28]: by one vote over the catch-up song.

1752
02:19:11,409 --> 02:19:12,149
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm so mad.

1753
02:19:12,909 --> 02:19:13,749
[SPEAKER_28]: Damn you, people.

1754
02:19:16,790 --> 02:19:17,630
[SPEAKER_29]: See, they planned it out.

1755
02:19:17,670 --> 02:19:21,151
[SPEAKER_29]: They wanted you to make you think you were going to win and then slide in that last vote.

1756
02:19:21,632 --> 02:19:21,992
[SPEAKER_28]: I know.

1757
02:19:22,012 --> 02:19:24,012
[SPEAKER_28]: They need to make the Big Fat Pickle song.

1758
02:19:24,032 --> 02:19:25,613
[SPEAKER_28]: You're plotting against me, I cry.

1759
02:19:26,053 --> 02:19:27,013
[SPEAKER_18]: The Big Fat Pickle song.

1760
02:19:28,173 --> 02:19:29,754
[SPEAKER_18]: Someone make me a Big Fat Pickle song.

1761
02:19:33,636 --> 02:19:41,702
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm a cucumber, I'm a cucumber, I'm a cucumber, I'm a cucumber, I'm a cucumber

1762
02:19:59,574 --> 02:20:03,158
[SPEAKER_30]: I have a suggestion because I've been noticing that this game is kind of flawed in a way.

1763
02:20:04,820 --> 02:20:14,731
[SPEAKER_30]: What we need to do is we need to get the answers from the contestants, but don't read them off and then get the answers from us first, then we get the contestants' answers.

1764
02:20:17,153 --> 02:20:18,515
[SPEAKER_30]: You know what I'm saying?

1765
02:20:18,795 --> 02:20:21,358
[SPEAKER_30]: Because then that way we're not influenced by their answers.

1766
02:20:25,302 --> 02:20:26,202
[SPEAKER_28]: What are you doing?

1767
02:20:28,723 --> 02:20:32,665
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry, Darkchild's using the air duster on his head.

1768
02:20:34,646 --> 02:20:35,726
[SPEAKER_28]: Seven people match game, that's fine.

1769
02:20:35,766 --> 02:20:39,568
[SPEAKER_29]: We should do it like how we did it with Loaded Crescents and just show each other who brought our answers.

1770
02:20:39,988 --> 02:20:40,448
[SPEAKER_28]: I agree.

1771
02:20:40,788 --> 02:20:42,849
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, we'll do that different this week and see how that works.

1772
02:20:42,869 --> 02:20:44,350
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll read the contestants' answers last.

1773
02:20:44,810 --> 02:20:50,973
[SPEAKER_28]: But, in order to get contestants, we have to have them answer a simple trivia question.

1774
02:20:52,234 --> 02:20:55,096
[SPEAKER_28]: What is the formula for a mole?

1775
02:20:55,176 --> 02:20:56,257
[SPEAKER_28]: I haven't been in school for a while.

1776
02:21:21,019 --> 02:21:21,879
[SPEAKER_29]: She said a bunch of stuff.

1777
02:21:21,899 --> 02:21:22,360
[SPEAKER_29]: How about this?

1778
02:21:23,480 --> 02:21:24,481
[SPEAKER_20]: What's 75 squared?

1779
02:21:27,562 --> 02:21:28,322
[SPEAKER_20]: What's 85 squared?

1780
02:21:31,444 --> 02:21:35,666
[SPEAKER_18]: The only thing that I learned when I was in school was how to avoid people and what a mole is.

1781
02:21:37,606 --> 02:21:40,428
[SPEAKER_18]: Which, by the way, is 6.02 times 10 to the negative 23rd power.

1782
02:21:41,708 --> 02:21:42,489
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, how about this?

1783
02:21:42,509 --> 02:21:43,369
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll make it really easy.

1784
02:21:43,389 --> 02:21:44,389
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, Kogan's boot size was a 16 in 1985.

1785
02:21:44,429 --> 02:21:44,890
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I don't think so.

1786
02:21:44,910 --> 02:21:45,010
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry.

1787
02:21:49,560 --> 02:21:56,202
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, whoever is the first two people to tell me what the fifth digit of pi is.

1788
02:22:02,103 --> 02:22:05,504
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, the first two people who tell me, and you've got to send it over a private message or it doesn't count.

1789
02:22:05,824 --> 02:22:06,845
[SPEAKER_28]: The fifth digit of pi.

1790
02:22:08,265 --> 02:22:11,246
[SPEAKER_28]: Because that was a big topic on DDR Freak earlier this week.

1791
02:22:13,046 --> 02:22:13,486
[SPEAKER_28]: It's I, right?

1792
02:22:13,506 --> 02:22:14,387
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, here we go, let's see.

1793
02:22:14,407 --> 02:22:14,427
[SPEAKER_28]: I.

1794
02:22:18,752 --> 02:22:23,335
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, the fifth digit of pie is... I think the fifth digit of pie is pie.

1795
02:22:24,696 --> 02:22:27,879
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the letter E. P-I-E-E-E.

1796
02:22:29,380 --> 02:22:29,620
[SPEAKER_24]: Right?

1797
02:22:30,521 --> 02:22:31,101
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, let's see.

1798
02:22:31,321 --> 02:22:33,123
[SPEAKER_24]: The fifth digit of me is my pinky.

1799
02:22:33,163 --> 02:22:34,924
[SPEAKER_28]: The fifth digit of pie.

1800
02:22:36,145 --> 02:22:37,026
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, here we go, here we go.

1801
02:22:37,066 --> 02:22:37,586
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see who got it.

1802
02:22:37,606 --> 02:22:38,287
[SPEAKER_28]: We got our winners.

1803
02:22:38,567 --> 02:22:42,270
[SPEAKER_28]: So we got three, one, four, one, five.

1804
02:22:42,990 --> 02:22:43,551
[SPEAKER_28]: So it's five.

1805
02:22:44,511 --> 02:22:45,032
[SPEAKER_28]: Jazz...

1806
02:22:45,973 --> 02:22:49,255
[SPEAKER_28]: Jazz said, well, he did say five, but he said four first.

1807
02:22:49,315 --> 02:22:49,715
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry.

1808
02:22:51,236 --> 02:22:52,957
[SPEAKER_28]: JB got it, so JB's in.

1809
02:22:53,117 --> 02:22:53,757
[SPEAKER_28]: He was next.

1810
02:22:54,778 --> 02:22:55,378
[SPEAKER_28]: And let's see.

1811
02:22:57,219 --> 02:22:59,660
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, it looks like we got 23rd Magus, so there you go.

1812
02:23:00,460 --> 02:23:02,942
[SPEAKER_20]: I thought you were counting from the end of Pi.

1813
02:23:02,982 --> 02:23:04,342
[SPEAKER_20]: No, sorry, I was not counting from the end of Pi.

1814
02:23:04,362 --> 02:23:04,703
[SPEAKER_28]: So there you go.

1815
02:23:08,188 --> 02:23:11,369
[SPEAKER_20]: That's why I said it, dumbass.

1816
02:23:11,929 --> 02:23:13,109
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, here we go.

1817
02:23:13,149 --> 02:23:14,170
[SPEAKER_28]: We got our two contestants.

02:23:14,190 --> 02:23:15,690
[SPEAKER_28]: We have JB and 23rd Magus.

1819
02:23:15,750 --> 02:23:16,390
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, here we go.

1820
02:23:16,670 --> 02:23:20,591
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, the way the match name works, because you guys, not everybody's been here before.

1821
02:23:20,771 --> 02:23:24,632
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to read questions, and they'll have a blank in them, and we have to fill in the blank.

1822
02:23:24,692 --> 02:23:28,834
[SPEAKER_28]: And if the contestants match what you say, then they get a point.

1823
02:23:29,334 --> 02:23:31,154
[SPEAKER_28]: And what does our fabulous winner tonight get?

1905
02:28:53,139 --> 02:28:53,820

[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, can I change my answer to hump the coin slot?

1910
02:29:01,785 --> 02:29:03,025

[SPEAKER_28]: He came back out of the darkness to see what was new in the scene, and he was surprised that the thing that had changed most in the scene was blank.

1917
02:29:36,656 --> 02:29:39,498
Wow, that sound of silence is like deep thought.

1918
02:29:39,518 --> 02:29:40,659
Okay, read it again.

1919
02:30:07,389 --> 02:30:10,131
[SPEAKER_28]: Darkchild has been out of the Bomani scene a long time.

1920
02:30:10,211 --> 02:30:17,516
[SPEAKER_28]: He came back out of the darkness to see what was new in the scene, and he was surprised that the thing that had changed most in the scene was blank.

1921
02:30:23,960 --> 02:30:25,140
[SPEAKER_28]: Be very, very quiet.

1922
02:30:25,181 --> 02:30:26,041
[SPEAKER_28]: People are thinking.

1923
02:30:28,683 --> 02:30:30,344
[SPEAKER_28]: Is there all the celebrities about walked in?

1924
02:30:31,204 --> 02:30:31,925
[SPEAKER_28]: A couple still writing.

1925
02:30:36,556 --> 02:30:37,897
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm waiting on one contestant.

1926
02:30:42,520 --> 02:30:43,040
[SPEAKER_28]: Any day now.

1927
02:30:43,741 --> 02:30:45,942
[SPEAKER_28]: The thing that changed most in the scene was blank.

1928
02:30:49,504 --> 02:30:50,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Jamie.

1929
02:30:57,349 --> 02:30:58,210
[SPEAKER_28]: Come on, contestant.

1930
02:30:59,431 --> 02:30:59,851
[SPEAKER_28]: Hurry it up.

1931
02:31:07,878 --> 02:31:08,718
[SPEAKER_28]: Are all the celebrities done?

1932
02:31:08,738 --> 02:31:09,579
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, all the celebrities done.

1933
02:31:09,859 --> 02:31:11,219
[SPEAKER_28]: We're waiting on a contestant.

1934
02:31:13,300 --> 02:31:14,240
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, I think we got it.

1935
02:31:16,901 --> 02:31:17,141
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

1936
02:31:18,241 --> 02:31:18,641
[SPEAKER_28]: Beautiful.

1937
02:31:19,642 --> 02:31:20,782
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie, your answer.

1938
02:31:22,782 --> 02:31:24,663
[SPEAKER_18]: The only thing that had changed was the stench.

1939
02:31:24,903 --> 02:31:27,064
[SPEAKER_18]: No one bothered to shower after still trying to PA Paranoia.

1940
02:31:27,084 --> 02:31:28,064
[SPEAKER_18]: The stench.

1941
02:31:33,468 --> 02:31:34,008
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

1942
02:31:35,369 --> 02:31:42,533
[SPEAKER_16]: Anita, the thing that had changed most in the scene was... Was all the DDR players were now wearing one white glove.

1943
02:31:44,575 --> 02:31:48,337
[SPEAKER_28]: All the DDR players were now wearing one white glove.

1944
02:31:50,418 --> 02:31:54,980
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki, the thing that had changed most in the scene was... I gotta follow that.

1945
02:31:55,621 --> 02:31:55,881
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

1946
02:31:57,142 --> 02:31:57,262
[SPEAKER_30]: Um...

1947
02:31:59,053 --> 02:32:05,559
[SPEAKER_30]: I didn't really come up with anything funny, so all the DDR players are little kids that are really stupid and should die.

1948
02:32:06,039 --> 02:32:08,521
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, all the DDR players are little kids that are stupid and should die.

1949
02:32:08,882 --> 02:32:09,522
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, zero.

1950
02:32:10,903 --> 02:32:15,707
[SPEAKER_29]: I couldn't come up with anything, so I figured the thing that changed the most was the child molesting gangbangers.

1951
02:32:16,028 --> 02:32:17,769
[SPEAKER_28]: The child molesting gangbangers.

1952
02:32:18,570 --> 02:32:19,190
[SPEAKER_20]: Dark Child!

1953
02:32:21,012 --> 02:32:24,555
[SPEAKER_20]: I couldn't think of anything, so the number of white boys playing.

1954
02:32:24,795 --> 02:32:26,657
[SPEAKER_28]: The number of white boys playing, thank you, thank you.

1955
02:32:28,382 --> 02:32:31,765
[SPEAKER_34]: Alright, Butterfly is number two instead of number one on Player's Best now.

1956
02:32:33,467 --> 02:32:34,148
[SPEAKER_28]: That's a good answer.

1957
02:32:35,069 --> 02:32:40,935
[SPEAKER_28]: I put, the thing that changed most in the scene is that kids thought they could actually be cool by doing an online radio show.

1958
02:32:45,799 --> 02:32:48,042
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway, let's see what the contestants said if we have any matches.

1959
02:32:49,283 --> 02:32:52,086
[SPEAKER_28]: 23rd Magus says the thing that changed most in the scene was mocap golf.

1960
02:32:55,959 --> 02:33:01,162
[SPEAKER_28]: JB says, the dirty little children at Roseville Golf Land had gotten a new soup called Cup of Child.

1961
02:33:01,823 --> 02:33:03,043
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, going for an inside joke.

1962
02:33:03,083 --> 02:33:03,424
[SPEAKER_28]: Beautiful.

1963
02:33:04,684 --> 02:33:05,285
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry.

1964
02:33:07,506 --> 02:33:08,547
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know if that counts.

1965
02:33:08,707 --> 02:33:09,387
[SPEAKER_28]: What do you guys think?

1966
02:33:09,888 --> 02:33:11,108
[SPEAKER_28]: Who said the RVGL thing?

1967
02:33:11,469 --> 02:33:12,529
[SPEAKER_28]: Somebody said something about RVGL.

1968
02:33:12,549 --> 02:33:13,030
[SPEAKER_28]: Was that zero?

1969
02:33:14,911 --> 02:33:15,151
[SPEAKER_28]: No.

1970
02:33:15,551 --> 02:33:15,811
[SPEAKER_28]: Nobody.

1971
02:33:15,871 --> 02:33:16,312
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, okay.

1972
02:33:18,813 --> 02:33:19,714
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry.

1973
02:33:19,794 --> 02:33:20,534
[SPEAKER_28]: I say zero.

1974
02:33:21,755 --> 02:33:21,975
[SPEAKER_28]: None.

1975
02:33:22,776 --> 02:33:23,156
[SPEAKER_28]: Zip, zip.

1976
02:33:23,296 --> 02:33:23,956
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, still tied.

1977
02:33:23,976 --> 02:33:24,237
[SPEAKER_28]: Here we go.

1978
02:33:24,277 --> 02:33:24,677
[SPEAKER_28]: Next question.

1979
02:33:26,343 --> 02:33:30,304
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie one day found herself on a deserted island with a shiny necklace on.

1980
02:33:33,505 --> 02:33:36,887
[SPEAKER_28]: She noticed that she was surrounded by children from Roseville Golf Land.

1981
02:33:37,647 --> 02:33:39,608
[SPEAKER_28]: The first thing she reached for was her blank.

1982
02:33:54,537 --> 02:33:58,321
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie one day found herself on a deserted island with a shiny necklace on.

1983
02:33:58,381 --> 02:34:01,485
[SPEAKER_28]: She noticed that she was surrounded by children from Roseville Golf Land.

1984
02:34:01,505 --> 02:34:03,167
[SPEAKER_28]: The first thing she reached for was her blank.

1985
02:34:04,829 --> 02:34:07,031
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, we have both our contestants in.

1986
02:34:07,372 --> 02:34:08,173
[SPEAKER_28]: How about the celebrities?

1987
02:34:16,568 --> 02:34:18,571
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, working on it.

1988
02:34:19,472 --> 02:34:20,494
[SPEAKER_28]: How are you doing, Anita?

1989
02:34:20,854 --> 02:34:21,255
[SPEAKER_28]: About ready?

1990
02:34:21,475 --> 02:34:21,996
[SPEAKER_28]: Almost done.

1991
02:34:22,777 --> 02:34:24,399
[SPEAKER_28]: Anita doing another marathon answer.

1992
02:34:26,582 --> 02:34:26,922
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

1993
02:34:30,828 --> 02:34:31,469
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, Jamie.

1994
02:34:32,882 --> 02:34:35,284
[SPEAKER_28]: woke up on a deserted island with a shiny necklace on.

1995
02:34:35,324 --> 02:34:37,566
[SPEAKER_28]: She noticed she was surrounded by children from Roseville Golf Land.

1996
02:34:37,586 --> 02:34:39,828
[SPEAKER_28]: The first thing she reached for was her blank.

1997
02:34:40,248 --> 02:34:40,489
[SPEAKER_28]: Ready?

1998
02:34:40,969 --> 02:34:42,991
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie, what was the first thing Jamie reached for?

1999
02:34:43,451 --> 02:34:43,871
[SPEAKER_18]: Propel.

2000
02:34:44,632 --> 02:34:46,173
[SPEAKER_18]: RPGL children are easy targets.

2001
02:34:47,875 --> 02:34:53,820
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, Anita, the first thing she reached for was her... Was her coconut nunchakus to open up a can of whoop-ass.

2002
02:34:54,520 --> 02:34:55,741
[SPEAKER_28]: Her coconut nunchakus.

2003
02:34:56,902 --> 02:34:57,723
Loki.

2004
02:34:59,665 --> 02:34:59,965
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki.

2005
02:35:00,973 --> 02:35:01,853
[SPEAKER_30]: It should be obvious.

2006
02:35:02,114 --> 02:35:02,694
[SPEAKER_30]: Orange bat.

2007
02:35:03,234 --> 02:35:04,515
[SPEAKER_28]: Her orange bat!

2008
02:35:05,215 --> 02:35:05,435
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh!

2009
02:35:05,555 --> 02:35:06,335
[SPEAKER_28]: Good answer!

2010
02:35:07,376 --> 02:35:08,116
[SPEAKER_28]: Good answer!

2011
02:35:08,636 --> 02:35:17,460
[SPEAKER_29]: Zero, the first thing she reached for was her... Well, with Jamie being surrounded by RVGL kids with their shiny new necklace on, I say, she reached for her necklace to take it off.

2012
02:35:22,203 --> 02:35:27,425
[SPEAKER_28]: Being surrounded by Rosal Goughland children, I'm... You know, I reached for my own.

2013
02:35:31,018 --> 02:35:33,639
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, I just ripped theirs off.

2014
02:35:35,920 --> 02:35:36,440
[SPEAKER_20]: Dark Child.

2015
02:35:37,120 --> 02:35:38,180
[SPEAKER_20]: God, my mind is dirty.

2016
02:35:39,781 --> 02:35:41,861
[SPEAKER_20]: A jizz rag to wipe off that shiny necklace.

2017
02:35:42,201 --> 02:35:46,302
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to stay off the internet.

2018
02:35:53,587 --> 02:35:54,167
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh my lord.

2019
02:35:54,267 --> 02:35:55,648
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, Asian Invasion.

2020
02:35:55,808 --> 02:36:00,909
[SPEAKER_24]: After that happened, the first thing she reached for was her... Immediately after that, she reached for her crack pipe.

2021
02:36:03,990 --> 02:36:04,510
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie!

2022
02:36:05,211 --> 02:36:06,071
[SPEAKER_28]: You have a crack pipe?

2023
02:36:07,111 --> 02:36:07,411
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

2024
02:36:08,092 --> 02:36:10,692
[SPEAKER_28]: I said the first thing she reached for was her fan.

2025
02:36:11,533 --> 02:36:12,193
[SPEAKER_28]: Remember the movie?

2026
02:36:12,713 --> 02:36:13,413
[SPEAKER_28]: The guy with the fan?

2027
02:36:13,533 --> 02:36:15,234
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, alright.

2028
02:36:17,054 --> 02:36:17,314
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

2029
02:36:18,315 --> 02:36:21,276
[SPEAKER_28]: JB said the first thing she reached for... Let's check for a match.

2030
02:36:21,296 --> 02:36:21,976
[SPEAKER_28]: I said the fan was cool.

2031
02:36:24,184 --> 02:36:25,345
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to check for a match.

2032
02:36:26,425 --> 02:36:28,687
[SPEAKER_28]: JB said the first thing she reached for was a fork.

2033
02:36:28,987 --> 02:36:30,088
[SPEAKER_28]: I almost said that.

2034
02:36:30,408 --> 02:36:31,969
[SPEAKER_18]: I almost said fork.

2035
02:36:31,989 --> 02:36:36,011
[SPEAKER_18]: But then again, RPGL children have herpes.

2036
02:36:36,091 --> 02:36:39,273
[SPEAKER_28]: 23rd Magus said the first thing she reached for was her boomstick.

2037
02:36:42,035 --> 02:36:42,896
[SPEAKER_33]: Good movie reference.

2038
02:36:43,676 --> 02:36:44,697
[SPEAKER_33]: Very good movie reference.

2039
02:36:45,257 --> 02:36:46,298
[SPEAKER_33]: Sam Raimi is God.

2040
02:36:46,958 --> 02:36:48,079
[SPEAKER_24]: It's still tied up.

2041
02:36:51,553 --> 02:36:53,315
[SPEAKER_28]: It's still tied up at nothing, nothing.

2042
02:36:53,355 --> 02:36:54,997
[SPEAKER_34]: Alright, let's go on to the next one.

2043
02:36:55,277 --> 02:36:55,597
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

2044
02:36:56,398 --> 02:36:56,819
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki!

2045
02:36:59,041 --> 02:37:02,945
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki was really excited to be moving into a new apartment very soon.

2046
02:37:04,227 --> 02:37:06,929
[SPEAKER_28]: A couple days before the move, though, he started to worry.

2047
02:37:07,790 --> 02:37:10,954
[SPEAKER_28]: What am I going to do about packing my massive collection of blank?

2048
02:37:15,810 --> 02:37:17,231
[SPEAKER_28]: It doesn't have to be the obvious.

2049
02:37:17,312 --> 02:37:18,152
[SPEAKER_28]: Do whatever you want.

2050
02:37:18,212 --> 02:37:20,054
[SPEAKER_28]: You've got to want to match the contestants.

2051
02:37:20,434 --> 02:37:21,595
[SPEAKER_28]: Do say what the contestants would say.

2052
02:37:22,576 --> 02:37:25,318
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki was really excited to be moving into a new apartment very soon.

2053
02:37:25,858 --> 02:37:27,820
[SPEAKER_28]: A couple days before the move, though, he started to worry.

2054
02:37:27,860 --> 02:37:31,262
[SPEAKER_28]: What am I going to do about packing my massive collection of blank?

2055
02:37:35,866 --> 02:37:37,267
[SPEAKER_18]: I came up with an answer very quickly.

2056
02:37:43,212 --> 02:37:44,493
[SPEAKER_28]: We have one contestant locked in.

2057
02:37:46,824 --> 02:37:48,065
[SPEAKER_28]: I think that's both contestants.

2058
02:37:49,906 --> 02:37:50,207
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

2059
02:37:52,929 --> 02:37:54,050
[SPEAKER_28]: Are all the celebrities ready?

2060
02:37:59,554 --> 02:38:00,895
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I'm almost ready.

2061
02:38:01,235 --> 02:38:01,695
[SPEAKER_15]: Almost.

2062
02:38:01,915 --> 02:38:02,236
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

2063
02:38:02,676 --> 02:38:04,737
[SPEAKER_15]: How do you spell... Never mind.

2064
02:38:06,899 --> 02:38:08,020
[SPEAKER_15]: How do you spell V?

2065
02:38:08,040 --> 02:38:08,060
[SPEAKER_18]: V?

2066
02:38:10,737 --> 02:38:11,598
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, here we go, Jamie.

2067
02:38:12,259 --> 02:38:15,241
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki had to pack his massive collection of... Corpses.

2068
02:38:15,562 --> 02:38:16,302
[SPEAKER_28]: Corpses!

2069
02:38:17,624 --> 02:38:18,665
[SPEAKER_18]: Good idea.

2070
02:38:20,406 --> 02:38:25,371
[SPEAKER_28]: Anita said, what am I going to do about packing my massive collection of... Of Barbie dolls.

2071
02:38:25,511 --> 02:38:26,852
[SPEAKER_28]: Barbie dolls.

2072
02:38:27,133 --> 02:38:27,973
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, so cute.

2073
02:38:30,356 --> 02:38:31,477
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay.

2074
02:38:32,718 --> 02:38:33,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

2075
02:38:33,699 --> 02:38:34,259
[SPEAKER_30]: Dead babies.

2076
02:38:34,700 --> 02:38:35,661
[SPEAKER_30]: Dead babies!

2077
02:38:39,068 --> 02:38:39,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Zero.

2078
02:38:39,949 --> 02:38:40,750
[SPEAKER_28]: I said shit.

2079
02:38:42,512 --> 02:38:43,894
[SPEAKER_28]: Massive collection of shit.

2080
02:38:43,934 --> 02:38:44,354
[SPEAKER_28]: How nice.

2081
02:38:44,455 --> 02:38:44,815
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

2082
02:38:46,737 --> 02:38:47,418
[SPEAKER_28]: Dark Child.

2083
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:49,701
[SPEAKER_20]: Real dolls.

2084
02:38:50,942 --> 02:38:51,643
[SPEAKER_28]: Real dolls.

2085
02:38:52,544 --> 02:38:52,765
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh!

2086
02:38:53,285 --> 02:38:54,587
[SPEAKER_28]: You know the... The...

2087
02:38:55,011 --> 02:38:59,996
[SPEAKER_20]: For those who don't know, they're really high-end, non-blow-up girlfriends.

2088
02:39:00,116 --> 02:39:02,459
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, fully articulate, they look realistic.

2089
02:39:03,020 --> 02:39:06,744
[SPEAKER_18]: On Real Sex, a guy's girlfriend... And they have men ones, too, with, like, big cocks.

2090
02:39:07,084 --> 02:39:08,285
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't care about the men ones.

2091
02:39:08,425 --> 02:39:10,447
[SPEAKER_18]: And they said that they were working on ones that actually came.

2092
02:39:10,728 --> 02:39:11,248
[SPEAKER_20]: RealDoll.com

2093
02:39:13,211 --> 02:39:14,112
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, not a match.

2094
02:39:14,132 --> 02:39:19,777
[SPEAKER_28]: I said, Loki, what is he going to do about packing his massive collection of cock rings?

2095
02:39:19,817 --> 02:39:20,657
[SPEAKER_28]: Cock rings, God.

2096
02:39:20,717 --> 02:39:24,100
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, let's see what the contestants said.

2097
02:39:41,317 --> 02:39:42,598
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see if we get a match.

2098
02:39:42,718 --> 02:39:46,341
[SPEAKER_28]: 23rd Magus says, What is Loki going to do about packing his massive collection of porn?

2099
02:39:49,204 --> 02:39:53,167
[SPEAKER_28]: JB says, What is he going to do about packing his massive collection of porn?

2100
02:39:53,568 --> 02:39:55,209
[SPEAKER_28]: Both contestants said porn.

2101
02:39:55,710 --> 02:39:56,250
[SPEAKER_28]: No match.

2102
02:39:56,951 --> 02:39:58,952
[SPEAKER_18]: It's funny that all the underage people think of porn.

2103
02:40:00,213 --> 02:40:01,615
[SPEAKER_28]: Shame on all of you perverts.

2104
02:40:02,595 --> 02:40:03,897
[SPEAKER_18]: We think of murder, right?

2105
02:40:05,379 --> 02:40:07,520
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't have a massive collection of porn.

2106
02:40:07,640 --> 02:40:10,241
[SPEAKER_30]: It's way outweighed by the massive collection of dead babies.

2107
02:40:10,582 --> 02:40:11,522
[SPEAKER_20]: Last question.

2108
02:40:11,562 --> 02:40:13,143
[SPEAKER_20]: This is your chance to shine.

2109
02:40:13,543 --> 02:40:17,525
[SPEAKER_20]: Just to be fair, I was going to say porn, but I thought someone else in the group would have already taken it.

2110
02:40:19,026 --> 02:40:21,707
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, well, it's still tied up.

2111
02:40:21,767 --> 02:40:22,207
[SPEAKER_18]: Nothing, nothing.

2112
02:40:22,227 --> 02:40:23,348
[SPEAKER_18]: Here's your last question.

2113
02:40:28,197 --> 02:40:32,239
[SPEAKER_28]: Rob got made a lot of fun of for playing the catch-up song on Orange Lounge Radio.

2114
02:40:32,939 --> 02:40:36,500
[SPEAKER_28]: After the show was over, the room decided that his punishment should be blank.

2115
02:40:57,379 --> 02:41:01,422
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, Rob got made a lot of fun of for playing the catch-up song on Orange Lounge Radio.

2116
02:41:01,962 --> 02:41:04,805
[SPEAKER_28]: After the show was over, the room decided that his punishment should be blank.

2117
02:41:08,707 --> 02:41:10,609
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, we have both our contestants locked in.

2118
02:41:10,669 --> 02:41:12,410
[SPEAKER_28]: Is everybody else in the room?

2119
02:41:13,251 --> 02:41:13,511
[SPEAKER_28]: Anita?

2120
02:41:17,394 --> 02:41:19,115
I'm just writing my chapters.

2121
02:41:20,231 --> 02:41:20,972
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, here we go.

2122
02:41:21,292 --> 02:41:22,833
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie, his punishment should be?

2123
02:41:23,233 --> 02:41:24,334
[SPEAKER_18]: To drink his weight in ketchup.

2124
02:41:24,794 --> 02:41:26,315
[SPEAKER_28]: To drink his weight in ketchup.

2125
02:41:26,335 --> 02:41:27,296
[SPEAKER_28]: That's a lot of ketchup.

2126
02:41:28,637 --> 02:41:30,098
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I didn't get quite as creative.

2127
02:41:31,599 --> 02:41:35,501
[SPEAKER_16]: Your punishment shall be to watch 24 hours of the Playboy channel.

2128
02:41:40,069 --> 02:41:41,630
[SPEAKER_28]: God, and softcore at that.

2129
02:41:41,690 --> 02:41:42,071
[SPEAKER_28]: Jesus.

2130
02:41:42,091 --> 02:41:43,192
[SPEAKER_28]: At least it was hardcore.

2131
02:41:43,232 --> 02:41:44,052
[SPEAKER_28]: It's somewhat exciting.

2132
02:41:44,072 --> 02:41:45,633
[SPEAKER_30]: You would fall asleep after about two minutes.

2133
02:41:45,653 --> 02:41:46,114
[SPEAKER_28]: I would seriously.

2134
02:41:46,134 --> 02:41:48,816
[SPEAKER_30]: I would fall asleep after about, like, a few minutes of that.

2135
02:41:49,336 --> 02:41:50,137
[SPEAKER_30]: It's awful.

2136
02:41:50,177 --> 02:41:51,238
[SPEAKER_28]: About five minutes for Loki?

2137
02:41:51,678 --> 02:41:53,219
[SPEAKER_30]: Uh, serious.

2138
02:41:53,380 --> 02:41:54,841
[SPEAKER_35]: It's just like, look at me.

2139
02:41:55,121 --> 02:41:56,162
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm rubbing my breasts.

2140
02:41:56,322 --> 02:41:58,484
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, it's just like, who cares?

2141
02:41:58,944 --> 02:42:02,607
[SPEAKER_30]: It's so, why are you, like, sneaking into some person's house to rub your breasts?

2142
02:42:02,627 --> 02:42:03,648
[SPEAKER_30]: It makes no sense.

2143
02:42:05,509 --> 02:42:08,770
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, but it makes no sense when you're just standing there going, oh, look at me.

2144
02:42:08,910 --> 02:42:13,871
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm standing here in the wind, exotic location, rubbing my breasts for no reason.

2145
02:42:14,391 --> 02:42:15,472
[SPEAKER_30]: Just standing there.

2146
02:42:15,612 --> 02:42:16,632
[SPEAKER_30]: She's not having sex.

2147
02:42:16,672 --> 02:42:19,633
[SPEAKER_30]: She's not, like, you know, getting it on or anything.

2148
02:42:19,673 --> 02:42:22,514
[SPEAKER_30]: She's just standing there saying, look at me.

2149
02:42:23,214 --> 02:42:24,694
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm sexy looking.

2150
02:42:25,194 --> 02:42:27,635
[SPEAKER_20]: If you had the Playboy channel on my house, I'd end up turning it to CNN.

2151
02:42:28,055 --> 02:42:32,296
[SPEAKER_30]: Dude, let's put it this way, I get every single Playboy movie that comes out, and they all suck ass.

2152
02:42:32,576 --> 02:42:41,539
[SPEAKER_30]: They're all regurgitated clips from older Playboy movies, and it's just, it's awful, they try to think... Girl's gone boring.

2153
02:42:42,099 --> 02:42:45,840
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, my answer was, punishment would be Rob would have to go straight.

2154
02:42:47,300 --> 02:42:48,141
[SPEAKER_29]: I almost said that.

2155
02:42:49,481 --> 02:42:53,062
[SPEAKER_29]: And by the way, they probably rub their breasts because it's cold on the beach, they gotta get warm.

2156
02:42:53,669 --> 02:42:56,011
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't understand how their nipples stick out all the time.

2157
02:42:56,872 --> 02:42:57,873
[SPEAKER_30]: How is that possible?

2158
02:42:58,514 --> 02:43:00,376
[SPEAKER_30]: Ice cubes, but... No, I don't want them.

2159
02:43:06,482 --> 02:43:08,404
[SPEAKER_29]: I said... It's called airbrushing.

2160
02:43:09,425 --> 02:43:13,689
[SPEAKER_29]: I said... I said at the end of the show, Rob would have to fuck... the ferret.

2161
02:43:16,966 --> 02:43:17,466
[SPEAKER_28]: How lovely.

2162
02:43:18,027 --> 02:43:18,507
[SPEAKER_28]: Dark Child.

2163
02:43:19,388 --> 02:43:22,549
[SPEAKER_20]: Rob's punishment should be... Jesus Christ, I am a child of the internet.

2164
02:43:23,190 --> 02:43:25,491
[SPEAKER_20]: Go down on everyone in the room and swallow.

2165
02:43:26,652 --> 02:43:26,832
[SPEAKER_28]: Ah!

2166
02:43:27,252 --> 02:43:28,793
[SPEAKER_28]: That is punishment, Jesus.

2167
02:43:29,994 --> 02:43:31,315
[SPEAKER_28]: That's punishment for everybody.

2168
02:43:41,561 --> 02:43:43,462
[SPEAKER_28]: You get to sell popcorn, there'll be plenty of salt.

2169
02:43:43,602 --> 02:43:43,942
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

2170
02:43:45,423 --> 02:43:46,384
[SPEAKER_28]: It's an innovation.

2171
02:43:48,550 --> 02:43:49,851
[SPEAKER_18]: Porn is the funniest thing ever.

2172
02:43:50,631 --> 02:43:51,972
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not exciting or anything.

2173
02:43:52,072 --> 02:43:52,772
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just funny.

2174
02:43:55,113 --> 02:43:55,794
[SPEAKER_22]: Easy and innovation.

2175
02:43:55,854 --> 02:43:58,415
[SPEAKER_28]: Rob's punishment should be the ketchup song.

2176
02:44:02,077 --> 02:44:02,297
[SPEAKER_28]: Good.

2177
02:44:02,377 --> 02:44:02,817
[SPEAKER_28]: Good answer.

2178
02:44:03,858 --> 02:44:08,200
[SPEAKER_28]: And my answer would be that Rob's punishment should be to have sex with lots of hot people.

2179
02:44:13,823 --> 02:44:15,243
[SPEAKER_28]: It sounds like a great punishment to me.

2180
02:44:15,664 --> 02:44:15,964
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob.

2181
02:44:16,084 --> 02:44:17,645
[SPEAKER_18]: I agree.

2182
02:44:17,665 --> 02:44:18,105
[SPEAKER_18]: Say that again.

2183
02:44:19,795 --> 02:44:20,756
[SPEAKER_30]: Who have leprosy?

2184
02:44:22,737 --> 02:44:23,557
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob, hand.

2185
02:44:27,360 --> 02:44:28,921
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see if we actually got a match.

2186
02:44:29,561 --> 02:44:32,323
[SPEAKER_28]: JB said Rob's punishment should be to be spanked.

2187
02:44:35,465 --> 02:44:37,446
[SPEAKER_28]: That's a reward, babe.

2188
02:44:37,526 --> 02:44:38,627
[SPEAKER_28]: It depends who by.

2189
02:44:38,967 --> 02:44:41,429
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, if we're talking like, you know, never mind.

2190
02:44:44,436 --> 02:44:47,920
[SPEAKER_28]: 23rd Magus said his punishment should be to be beaten with orange bats.

2191
02:44:48,180 --> 02:44:49,461
[SPEAKER_29]: Nobody said go straight.

2192
02:44:49,802 --> 02:44:52,224
[SPEAKER_29]: You guys could not have said go straight.

2193
02:44:52,584 --> 02:44:53,805
[SPEAKER_29]: That was the most obvious answer.

2194
02:44:54,266 --> 02:44:55,387
[SPEAKER_29]: Why do you think I'm kidding?

2195
02:44:56,968 --> 02:44:57,589
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know.

2196
02:44:58,390 --> 02:44:59,110
[SPEAKER_29]: You tell me.

2197
02:45:00,351 --> 02:45:05,596
[SPEAKER_18]: It's okay because boys are stupid anyway, except present company.

2198
02:45:08,217 --> 02:45:08,737
[SPEAKER_28]: on that note.

2199
02:45:09,378 --> 02:45:10,938
[SPEAKER_28]: So, we have our big finish.

2200
02:45:11,279 --> 02:45:12,579
[SPEAKER_28]: The big scores, here they are.

2201
02:45:12,659 --> 02:45:13,640
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's total it up.

2202
02:45:15,300 --> 02:45:17,481
[SPEAKER_28]: JB has a score of zero.

2203
02:45:18,582 --> 02:45:20,823
[SPEAKER_28]: And 23 Magus has a score of zero.

2204
02:45:21,904 --> 02:45:22,924
[SPEAKER_18]: You win nothing.

2205
02:45:23,444 --> 02:45:24,505
[SPEAKER_18]: Nothing at all.

2206
02:45:24,825 --> 02:45:25,785
[SPEAKER_18]: Good day, sir.

2207
02:45:25,865 --> 02:45:26,286
[SPEAKER_24]: Wow.

2208
02:45:26,406 --> 02:45:28,066
[SPEAKER_24]: You couldn't even get a magazine.

2209
02:45:28,106 --> 02:45:28,687
[SPEAKER_24]: That's pretty sad.

2210
02:45:28,747 --> 02:45:29,767
[SPEAKER_24]: So, this is what happens.

2211
02:45:30,468 --> 02:45:31,168
[SPEAKER_24]: As punishment,

2212
02:45:31,917 --> 02:45:34,758
[SPEAKER_24]: You two get all of the punishments that were mentioned earlier.

2213
02:45:34,838 --> 02:45:35,478
[SPEAKER_28]: So there you go.

2214
02:45:36,118 --> 02:45:37,039
[SPEAKER_28]: Live at March Madness.

2215
02:45:37,699 --> 02:45:42,500
[SPEAKER_18]: They get to be spanked, anally raped, and then get hot people.

2216
02:45:43,080 --> 02:45:44,281
[SPEAKER_20]: And then go down on all of us.

2217
02:45:44,861 --> 02:45:47,682
[SPEAKER_20]: They're underage!

2218
02:45:48,142 --> 02:45:55,144
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey, but remember, one of your punishments was... Hey Rob, one of the punishments was getting to have sex with a bunch of hot people.

2219
02:45:57,064 --> 02:45:57,704
[SPEAKER_20]: That's true!

2220
02:45:57,825 --> 02:45:58,945
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd throw the game for that one.

2221
02:46:00,885 --> 02:46:01,546
[SPEAKER_28]: That's very true.

2222
02:46:01,686 --> 02:46:03,647
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah, but I'll take the game back for the fair.

2223
02:46:03,667 --> 02:46:03,907
[SPEAKER_34]: No.

2224
02:46:04,267 --> 02:46:04,928
[SPEAKER_34]: That ain't happening.

2225
02:46:06,309 --> 02:46:06,649
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

2226
02:46:07,410 --> 02:46:10,432
[SPEAKER_28]: So, um... They're demanding a tiebreaker, but you know what?

2227
02:46:10,472 --> 02:46:11,072
[SPEAKER_28]: We don't have much time.

2228
02:46:11,092 --> 02:46:13,594
[SPEAKER_28]: Because we have to take a quick break, and then we're going to come back and wrap up the show.

2229
02:46:18,938 --> 02:46:19,338
[SPEAKER_18]: Take a break.

2230
02:46:19,378 --> 02:46:21,060
[SPEAKER_18]: Take a small break, but we'll come back for our special.

2231
02:46:24,442 --> 02:46:27,965
[SPEAKER_28]: Small break, one song, and this is your chance to ask Orange Lounge.

2232
02:46:28,205 --> 02:46:29,826
[SPEAKER_28]: Or, tonight, you can ask...

2233
02:46:31,240 --> 02:46:32,143
[SPEAKER_27]: Who's fucking with the mic?

2234
02:46:34,335 --> 02:46:36,537
[SPEAKER_18]: or tonight... I have the mic.

2235
02:46:36,937 --> 02:46:39,299
[SPEAKER_18]: Or tonight, you get alienly raped by the ferret.

2236
02:46:40,239 --> 02:46:45,623
[SPEAKER_28]: No, tonight you can either ask Orange Lounge or you can ask Dark Child or you can ask Asian Innovation.

2237
02:46:45,643 --> 02:46:47,985
[SPEAKER_28]: Just send those to the chat room.

2238
02:46:48,265 --> 02:46:50,367
[SPEAKER_28]: And if you're not in our chat room, fucking get in there.

2239
02:46:50,467 --> 02:46:55,270
[SPEAKER_28]: Go to KaliBamani.com and then click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.

2240
02:46:55,330 --> 02:46:56,511
[SPEAKER_28]: It's super duper easy.

2241
02:46:56,531 --> 02:46:57,412
[SPEAKER_28]: Why aren't you here already?

2242
02:46:58,493 --> 02:46:59,773
[SPEAKER_28]: What do you guys think for a break song?

2243
02:47:00,354 --> 02:47:01,114
[SPEAKER_28]: Something from DDR, something from GDX.

2244
02:47:01,134 --> 02:47:01,855
[SPEAKER_18]: Something annoying.

2245
02:47:02,255 --> 02:47:03,036
[SPEAKER_28]: Something annoying?

2246
02:47:03,544 --> 02:47:04,245
[SPEAKER_18]: Play Orion.

2247
02:47:05,926 --> 02:47:06,767
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, play Blue Moon Dollar.

2248
02:47:06,947 --> 02:47:11,551
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, so it'll be a quick break, and we'll be right back after Ask Orange Lounge.

2249
02:47:11,571 --> 02:47:13,233
[SPEAKER_28]: So send your questions to Sky in the chat room.

2250
02:47:48,971 --> 02:47:49,717
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

2251
02:48:37,691 --> 02:48:40,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.

2252
02:48:41,512 --> 02:48:43,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio.

2253
02:48:45,654 --> 02:48:46,094
[SPEAKER_28]: Ha ha.

2254
02:48:46,794 --> 02:48:47,095
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

2255
02:48:48,975 --> 02:48:49,816
[SPEAKER_28]: Oops.

2256
02:48:50,056 --> 02:48:51,116
[SPEAKER_28]: Nope, we're not doing Match Game anymore.

2257
02:48:51,136 --> 02:48:52,196
[SPEAKER_28]: I have to queue up the other music.

2258
02:48:52,517 --> 02:48:56,758
[SPEAKER_28]: So this is a little segment we do when we need some time filler.

2259
02:48:57,358 --> 02:49:01,200
[SPEAKER_28]: Because our chat room is very creative, so we allow them to ask Orange Lounge.

2260
02:49:02,640 --> 02:49:03,441
[SPEAKER_28]: So here we go.

2261
02:49:05,762 --> 02:49:06,802
[SPEAKER_28]: Show's ten minutes longer.

2262
02:49:08,414 --> 02:49:09,415
[SPEAKER_15]: Ask us questions.

2263
02:49:09,435 --> 02:49:10,215
[SPEAKER_15]: Here we go.

2264
02:49:12,596 --> 02:49:18,318
[SPEAKER_28]: Ask Orange Lounge, or tonight you can ask Dark Child or Asian Innovation.

2265
02:49:18,498 --> 02:49:24,261
[SPEAKER_28]: 23rd Magus says, seriously though, if I beg and plead enough, will Orange Lounge sponsor me for March Madness?

2266
02:49:24,301 --> 02:49:26,182
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm already making my Orange Lounge shirt.

2267
02:49:29,203 --> 02:49:32,124
[SPEAKER_28]: If I endure all punishments mentioned, will I get sponsored?

2268
02:49:33,204 --> 02:49:34,085
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be amusing.

2269
02:49:36,646 --> 02:49:37,006
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a guy.

2270
02:49:40,816 --> 02:49:42,598
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, should we consider it?

2271
02:49:43,238 --> 02:49:44,099
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll consider it.

2272
02:49:45,360 --> 02:49:45,981
[SPEAKER_28]: We have to see.

2273
02:49:46,001 --> 02:49:46,321
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see.

2274
02:49:46,341 --> 02:49:48,183
[SPEAKER_18]: Keep in mind that one of us is unemployed.

2275
02:49:50,806 --> 02:49:54,749
[SPEAKER_20]: If you could out-drink me on Bacardi 151, I will sponsor you.

2276
02:49:56,231 --> 02:49:57,332
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll pay your win.

2277
02:49:57,532 --> 02:50:00,255
[SPEAKER_28]: Come to think of it, I think it would be worth it to see his freestyle.

2278
02:50:03,516 --> 02:50:04,117
[SPEAKER_30]: I'll do it.

2279
02:50:04,197 --> 02:50:05,038
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, one of us will do it.

2280
02:50:05,238 --> 02:50:05,818
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll figure it out.

2281
02:50:06,139 --> 02:50:10,663
[SPEAKER_28]: But you need to try and come up with the money yourself, because if we have to sponsor you, we're making you do something humiliating.

2282
02:50:14,467 --> 02:50:14,968
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

2283
02:50:19,830 --> 02:50:23,511
[SPEAKER_28]: Justin S, your jazz, sorry, I just gave you a real name over the air, my bad.

2284
02:50:23,972 --> 02:50:26,753
[SPEAKER_28]: To everyone, can I have about $100 and a ride to March Madness?

2285
02:50:26,893 --> 02:50:27,073
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

2286
02:50:27,213 --> 02:50:29,294
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll bring Clock Tower 3 and bad horror movies.

2287
02:50:29,955 --> 02:50:33,296
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I can't give you a ride, but you can, like, hang out.

2288
02:50:33,776 --> 02:50:37,939
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, um, you can certainly stay at the Orange Lounge World Headquarters, a.k.a.

2289
02:50:37,979 --> 02:50:40,580
[SPEAKER_28]: my house, if you can, uh, find a ride here.

2290
02:50:40,680 --> 02:50:42,661
[SPEAKER_28]: If you just post on DDR Freak, you might be able to find something.

2291
02:50:45,293 --> 02:50:51,599
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkTetsuya says, are we, me slash 23Maggots, still on for hosting Orange Lounge Radio next weekend?

2292
02:50:52,040 --> 02:50:53,261
[SPEAKER_28]: No, you fool!

2293
02:50:53,842 --> 02:50:57,886
[SPEAKER_28]: Me, DarkSakura, and Loki are the hosts of Orange Lounge Radio, but you guys can guest.

2294
02:50:58,326 --> 02:50:59,507
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, you get to help.

2295
02:51:00,368 --> 02:51:00,869
[SPEAKER_28]: You can help.

2296
02:51:04,730 --> 02:51:14,539
[SPEAKER_28]: John Fields wants to know, how much of a hero would someone be if he or she created a DWI of a DDR non-stop megamix all custom steps?

2297
02:51:14,879 --> 02:51:15,760
Oh my god!

2298
02:51:17,101 --> 02:51:18,863
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm so excited!

2299
02:51:20,484 --> 02:51:23,347
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be long and I would fall over dead.

2300
02:51:24,562 --> 02:51:25,023
[SPEAKER_30]: No!

2301
02:51:25,583 --> 02:51:26,044
[SPEAKER_30]: Stop!

2302
02:51:26,584 --> 02:51:27,825
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, here's what people are doing, though.

2303
02:51:27,845 --> 02:51:31,728
[SPEAKER_30]: They're making steps for tracks off of the non-stop.

2304
02:51:32,188 --> 02:51:34,590
[SPEAKER_30]: Single tracks, okay, as long as the steps are good.

2305
02:51:35,170 --> 02:51:38,012
[SPEAKER_30]: Full non-stop, that's the stupidest idea ever.

2306
02:51:38,272 --> 02:51:40,594
[SPEAKER_30]: What do you think you are, DWI Insanity or something?

2307
02:51:41,174 --> 02:51:45,757
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, it's not... I mean, they're the ones that make the 45-minute long ones.

2308
02:51:45,857 --> 02:51:46,318
[SPEAKER_30]: Stop it.

2309
02:51:46,398 --> 02:51:49,240
[SPEAKER_30]: Don't try to be... Come up with something original.

2310
02:51:54,529 --> 02:51:55,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I got mail!

2311
02:51:55,330 --> 02:51:56,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

2312
02:51:56,772 --> 02:51:57,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I got mail!

2313
02:51:57,673 --> 02:51:58,594
[SPEAKER_02]: I got mail!

2314
02:51:58,834 --> 02:51:59,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

2315
02:52:04,881 --> 02:52:07,665
[SPEAKER_28]: We have a question for Asian Innovation from DDR Mike.

2316
02:52:08,606 --> 02:52:09,547
[SPEAKER_28]: We have two questions.

2317
02:52:12,562 --> 02:52:15,044
[SPEAKER_28]: How much weight did you put on from yesterday's party?

2318
02:52:16,325 --> 02:52:17,406
[SPEAKER_24]: I only had two ribs.

2319
02:52:18,607 --> 02:52:19,667
[SPEAKER_24]: But, yeah.

2320
02:52:21,309 --> 02:52:24,711
[SPEAKER_24]: And then, how was that horrible, wonderful job at Jack in the Box?

2321
02:52:26,733 --> 02:52:28,374
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know, I gave most of the food to you.

2322
02:52:32,438 --> 02:52:32,838
[SPEAKER_28]: Beautiful.

2323
02:52:33,438 --> 02:52:37,120
[SPEAKER_28]: And that's all the questions I've gotten so far for Ask Orange Lounge.

2324
02:52:37,140 --> 02:52:38,921
[SPEAKER_28]: So we'll give them a couple more minutes.

2325
02:52:39,581 --> 02:52:41,082
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not funny, Mike.

2326
02:52:41,122 --> 02:52:41,722
[SPEAKER_28]: Quit laughing.

2327
02:52:44,983 --> 02:52:47,424
[SPEAKER_28]: Does anybody have a question for someone else here in the room?

2328
02:52:49,825 --> 02:52:50,646
[SPEAKER_18]: Will someone hire me?

2329
02:52:52,146 --> 02:52:52,446
[SPEAKER_18]: Please.

2330
02:52:53,667 --> 02:52:54,967
[SPEAKER_20]: What are your job qualifications?

2331
02:52:56,048 --> 02:52:57,589
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, my resume is on Rob's computer.

2332
02:53:03,428 --> 02:53:06,929
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that resume in MPEG or QuickTime?

2333
02:53:07,029 --> 02:53:09,530
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, Rob, you sat and watched Ally McFeel with me.

2334
02:53:10,870 --> 02:53:11,771
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh my god, you are gay.

2335
02:53:11,791 --> 02:53:15,932
[SPEAKER_18]: That was the funniest porn ever.

2336
02:53:17,432 --> 02:53:18,753
[SPEAKER_28]: Ally McFeel had fucking Ron Jeremy in it.

2337
02:53:18,793 --> 02:53:19,333
[SPEAKER_28]: It was awesome.

2338
02:53:20,693 --> 02:53:21,153
[SPEAKER_20]: Sweet.

2339
02:53:21,854 --> 02:53:22,894
[SPEAKER_20]: Ron Jeremy is a god.

2340
02:53:24,754 --> 02:53:26,675
[SPEAKER_28]: Have you seen Porn Star, The Legend of Ron Jeremy?

2341
02:53:27,315 --> 02:53:27,895
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I have not.

2342
02:53:27,915 --> 02:53:28,575
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a sweet movie.

2343
02:53:29,096 --> 02:53:29,356
[SPEAKER_28]: Rent it.

2344
02:53:29,596 --> 02:53:30,016
[SPEAKER_20]: Is it porn?

2345
02:53:30,518 --> 02:53:36,761
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not actually porn, but I mean, they have like little clips and things, but it's still kind of, it's NC-17, but not really like porn.

2346
02:53:36,861 --> 02:53:37,942
[SPEAKER_20]: What's this word, rent?

2347
02:53:38,522 --> 02:53:40,003
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't understand this word, rent.

2348
02:53:40,363 --> 02:53:40,684
[SPEAKER_20]: Rent.

2349
02:53:41,264 --> 02:53:42,324
[SPEAKER_20]: I have Kazaa.

2350
02:53:42,404 --> 02:53:42,965
[SPEAKER_20]: What's rent?

2351
02:53:44,125 --> 02:53:45,706
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that when I delete it after I watch it?

2352
02:53:46,367 --> 02:53:47,067
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, yes.

2353
02:53:47,347 --> 02:53:50,449
[SPEAKER_28]: That's when you, you only have 24 hours after downloading this.

2354
02:53:51,950 --> 02:53:52,190
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

2355
02:53:52,490 --> 02:53:53,090
[SPEAKER_28]: More questions.

2356
02:53:54,031 --> 02:53:55,111
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a question for the chat room.

2357
02:53:56,452 --> 02:53:59,954
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyone in there, find me Battle Royale Special Edition and buy it for me.

2358
02:54:01,232 --> 02:54:02,513
[SPEAKER_20]: I have a question for the chat room.

2359
02:54:02,793 --> 02:54:03,074
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh-huh?

2360
02:54:03,674 --> 02:54:05,256
[SPEAKER_20]: Do I know anyone in the chat room?

2361
02:54:05,556 --> 02:54:05,836
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know.

2362
02:54:05,856 --> 02:54:06,417
[SPEAKER_27]: Want to come look?

2363
02:54:06,877 --> 02:54:07,217
[SPEAKER_28]: The list?

2364
02:54:07,718 --> 02:54:07,978
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, no.

2365
02:54:07,998 --> 02:54:08,959
[SPEAKER_28]: They might have changed their names.

2366
02:54:09,499 --> 02:54:10,020
[SPEAKER_28]: That's very true.

2367
02:54:11,421 --> 02:54:13,263
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, John Fields has a follow-up project.

2368
02:54:14,093 --> 02:54:18,436
[SPEAKER_28]: He says, let me plug, oh, this isn't the plug segment, this is the ask segment, but fine, I'll let you get away with it.

2369
02:54:18,897 --> 02:54:29,004
[SPEAKER_28]: Let me plug a project I'm working on then, http://www.squaredancedance.tk That's a little scary, let's look at the site real fast.

2370
02:54:29,224 --> 02:54:30,325
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki, what do you think of this?

2371
02:54:31,926 --> 02:54:33,147
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, wait, I think I've heard of this.

2372
02:54:33,715 --> 02:54:39,518
[SPEAKER_30]: SquareDance is just those remixed Final Fantasy and Square songs.

2373
02:54:40,959 --> 02:54:44,821
[SPEAKER_30]: And I know there's a guy that's been releasing DWIs for them.

2374
02:54:45,702 --> 02:54:46,662
[SPEAKER_28]: I think I played one of those.

2375
02:54:46,682 --> 02:54:48,624
[SPEAKER_28]: I have a splitting headache and it hurts!

2376
02:54:49,724 --> 02:54:51,185
[SPEAKER_28]: Didn't I play one of those the other night?

2377
02:54:52,005 --> 02:54:52,526
[SPEAKER_28]: At your party?

2378
02:54:52,566 --> 02:54:53,907
[SPEAKER_28]: I think you have all these already.

2379
02:54:54,547 --> 02:54:55,568
[SPEAKER_23]: I think I played one of them.

2380
02:54:55,828 --> 02:54:56,128
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I...

2381
02:54:57,526 --> 02:54:58,687
[SPEAKER_20]: I think Squaresoft Rocks.

2382
02:54:59,428 --> 02:55:00,468
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll go to that page a lot.

2383
02:55:02,010 --> 02:55:03,691
[SPEAKER_20]: But that's not Orange Line talking, that's just me.

2384
02:55:04,592 --> 02:55:08,055
[SPEAKER_28]: DDR Mike, by the way, says, Her, her, shut up, squinty-eyed Asian hoe.

2385
02:55:14,320 --> 02:55:15,240
[SPEAKER_34]: Why did he call you a hoe?

2386
02:55:17,748 --> 02:55:18,908
[SPEAKER_34]: I'll be over at your house tonight at 11.

2387
02:55:21,969 --> 02:55:22,349
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

2388
02:55:22,749 --> 02:55:23,590
[SPEAKER_28]: You other hoe.

2389
02:55:24,470 --> 02:55:28,191
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkTetsuya wants to know, how come more females don't come in the chat room?

2390
02:55:28,231 --> 02:55:28,551
[SPEAKER_28]: Cry.

2391
02:55:30,972 --> 02:55:32,792
[SPEAKER_18]: That's because there's no one there who excites them enough.

2392
02:55:33,552 --> 02:55:34,513
[SPEAKER_28]: They're too busy cooking.

2393
02:55:36,833 --> 02:55:39,734
[SPEAKER_18]: Are there females coming in the chat room right now?

2394
02:55:40,459 --> 02:55:44,622
[SPEAKER_18]: First of all, they don't come in the chatroom because it'll make a big stinky mess.

2395
02:55:45,202 --> 02:55:46,543
[SPEAKER_27]: They don't come because you haven't found the G-spot.

2396
02:55:46,784 --> 02:55:48,044
[SPEAKER_20]: It's because I haven't been here yet.

2397
02:55:48,665 --> 02:55:51,887
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I can't come when you fuck me.

2398
02:55:52,628 --> 02:55:54,889
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, if a girl was coming, she wouldn't be in the chatroom.

2399
02:55:57,351 --> 02:55:57,731
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

2400
02:55:59,873 --> 02:56:00,753
[SPEAKER_28]: Last one.

2401
02:56:01,214 --> 02:56:01,674
[SPEAKER_28]: Last one.

2402
02:56:01,714 --> 02:56:02,034
[SPEAKER_28]: Here we go.

2403
02:56:02,094 --> 02:56:05,957
[SPEAKER_28]: Last question from Justin Circuit says, can you give me money?

2404
02:56:08,019 --> 02:56:09,039
[SPEAKER_18]: Depends on what you'll do for me.

2405
02:56:09,279 --> 02:56:09,920
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll give you a dollar.

2406
02:56:10,680 --> 02:56:11,600
[SPEAKER_28]: Can you give me stuff?

2407
02:56:12,981 --> 02:56:13,821
[SPEAKER_28]: Can you give me head?

2408
02:56:15,482 --> 02:56:16,202
[SPEAKER_28]: From Justin?

2409
02:56:17,522 --> 02:56:18,263
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll close my eyes.

2410
02:56:20,983 --> 02:56:21,384
[SPEAKER_29]: Alright.

2411
02:56:24,665 --> 02:56:26,225
[SPEAKER_29]: I'll give him money from Argentina.

2412
02:56:27,406 --> 02:56:30,467
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, so, on that note, that's the end of Ask Orange Lounge.

2413
02:56:30,487 --> 02:56:32,067
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, one more, there's one more, there's one more.

2414
02:56:33,808 --> 02:56:34,908
[SPEAKER_28]: One more, this is the last question.

2415
02:56:34,928 --> 02:56:37,209
[SPEAKER_28]: This is a good one to end it on because it kind of relates to March Madness.

2416
02:56:37,229 --> 02:56:37,269
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh!

2417
02:56:38,220 --> 02:56:44,301
[SPEAKER_28]: Skyline DC505 wants to know, would doing bag five speed for the qualifier be noobish?

2418
02:56:46,542 --> 02:56:47,602
[SPEAKER_28]: Go ahead, I don't care.

2419
02:56:48,642 --> 02:56:50,162
[SPEAKER_25]: Just do it on one speed later on.

2420
02:56:50,342 --> 02:56:50,783
[SPEAKER_25]: Have fun.

2421
02:56:53,423 --> 02:56:56,764
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, and now's that time of the show where we have to wrap it up.

2422
02:56:56,984 --> 02:56:59,424
[SPEAKER_28]: But first, we go around the room and get everyone's final thoughts.

2423
02:57:00,544 --> 02:57:02,205
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob, can we wrap it up in ribbon and bows?

2424
02:57:03,725 --> 02:57:04,285
[SPEAKER_20]: And confetti.

2425
02:57:04,805 --> 02:57:05,205
[SPEAKER_18]: And leather.

2426
02:57:06,566 --> 02:57:07,046
[SPEAKER_18]: And chains.

2427
02:57:07,506 --> 02:57:07,886
[SPEAKER_18]: And whips.

2428
02:57:09,713 --> 02:57:10,853
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, now I'm getting into this.

2429
02:57:13,054 --> 02:57:15,295
[SPEAKER_18]: And, and, like, playing hot pokers.

2430
02:57:18,277 --> 02:57:25,059
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have much to say, how about... Pikachu!

2431
02:57:25,099 --> 02:57:31,842
[SPEAKER_30]: All I gotta say is, uh, unfortunately there will not be an update to my site tonight or tomorrow because I have a headache and I'll probably be going to sleep.

2432
02:57:33,283 --> 02:57:34,263
[SPEAKER_30]: So maybe Tuesday.

2433
02:57:38,365 --> 02:57:38,705
[SPEAKER_30]: What?! !

2434
02:57:40,896 --> 02:57:42,077
[SPEAKER_30]: What the hell's your problem, man?

2435
02:57:43,898 --> 02:57:47,161
[SPEAKER_11]: You're a savior because you don't have one of those live doll things.

2436
02:57:47,201 --> 02:57:50,384
[SPEAKER_11]: Real dolls, whatever it is.

2437
02:57:54,987 --> 02:57:59,711
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, I accept this award on the behalf of myself because you all suck.

2438
02:58:00,832 --> 02:58:02,413
[SPEAKER_29]: And one last thing, you are cool.

2439
02:58:05,155 --> 02:58:05,976
[SPEAKER_18]: You're so cute.

2440
02:58:06,877 --> 02:58:08,318
[SPEAKER_18]: You're the coolest girl in the world.

2441
02:58:10,713 --> 02:58:13,114
[SPEAKER_20]: I declare war on Iraq because I'm a Texan.

2442
02:58:13,194 --> 02:58:13,874
[SPEAKER_20]: Bang, bang, bang.

2443
02:58:13,954 --> 02:58:14,514
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm a Texan.

2444
02:58:14,594 --> 02:58:15,094
[SPEAKER_20]: Bang, bang.

2445
02:58:19,776 --> 02:58:21,897
[SPEAKER_30]: April 15th, go buy your Miyazaki films.

2446
02:58:21,937 --> 02:58:26,739
[SPEAKER_30]: Castle in the Sky, Spirited Away, and Kiki's Delivery Service come out on DVD in English.

2447
02:58:28,320 --> 02:58:30,481
[SPEAKER_18]: And April 19th is my birthday, so give me stuff.

2448
02:58:32,962 --> 02:58:33,762
[SPEAKER_34]: Your final thought, Mike?

2449
02:58:34,127 --> 02:58:35,449
[SPEAKER_34]: Go to March Madness, please.

2450
02:58:35,549 --> 02:58:37,032
[SPEAKER_34]: I don't want to turn on, like, five people.

2451
02:58:37,152 --> 02:58:37,412
[SPEAKER_34]: All right.

2452
02:58:37,452 --> 02:58:37,733
[SPEAKER_34]: Thanks.

2453
02:58:37,793 --> 02:58:38,073
[SPEAKER_34]: Bye.

2454
02:58:39,055 --> 02:58:41,860
[SPEAKER_28]: My final thought is Zelda comes out tomorrow.

2455
02:58:42,160 --> 02:58:42,941
[SPEAKER_28]: Is anyone moist?

2456
02:58:44,844 --> 02:58:45,866
[SPEAKER_18]: Has anyone already played it?

2457
02:58:47,989 --> 02:58:48,290
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

2458
02:58:49,946 --> 02:58:50,447
[SPEAKER_28]: That's it.

2459
02:58:50,807 --> 02:58:51,448
[SPEAKER_28]: End of show.

2460
02:58:51,548 --> 02:58:57,454
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't forget, no show next week because we're live all day long, Saturday and Sunday.

2461
02:58:57,654 --> 02:59:01,017
[SPEAKER_28]: Listen, for God's sake, or at least come to the tournament.

2462
02:59:01,097 --> 02:59:03,300
[SPEAKER_28]: Because if nobody listens, we'll never do it again.

2463
02:59:03,320 --> 02:59:03,800
[SPEAKER_28]: Just kidding.

2464
02:59:03,820 --> 02:59:07,043
[SPEAKER_28]: We're already planning on doing it at B3 as well, but not after that.

2465
02:59:07,204 --> 02:59:08,785
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

2466
02:59:08,825 --> 02:59:09,746
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you very much for listening.

2467
02:59:09,906 --> 02:59:10,967
[SPEAKER_28]: It's 44 Times Radio.

2468
02:59:11,248 --> 02:59:11,708
[SPEAKER_28]: We love you.

2469
02:59:12,049 --> 02:59:13,270
[SPEAKER_03]: The system is down.

2470
02:59:14,620 --> 02:59:15,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Go, go, Power Rangers!

2471
02:59:41,468 --> 02:59:41,868
[SPEAKER_36]: Hey, dude!

2472
02:59:41,888 --> 02:59:42,549
[SPEAKER_36]: Hey, you just changed!

2473
02:59:42,569 --> 02:59:43,790
[SPEAKER_36]: Yeah, I know, we always change characters every day.

2474
02:59:43,810 --> 02:59:44,170
[SPEAKER_36]: Oh, okay.

2475
02:59:44,210 --> 02:59:45,451
[SPEAKER_36]: Hey, I'm a little kid and I'm gonna join the Power Rangers.

2476
02:59:45,471 --> 02:59:45,992
[SPEAKER_36]: How do you know about us?

2477
02:59:46,012 --> 02:59:46,832
[SPEAKER_36]: Because I watch the show every day.

2478
02:59:46,872 --> 02:59:47,133
[SPEAKER_36]: Oh, okay.

2479
02:59:47,273 --> 02:59:52,697
[SPEAKER_36]: Hey, guys, look, it's those three teenagers that exactly match the Power Rangers personalities and their voices and every single thing about them.

2480
02:59:52,797 --> 02:59:53,318
[SPEAKER_36]: Let's go harass them.

2481
02:59:53,518 --> 02:59:54,218
[SPEAKER_36]: Okay, Bull, come on.

2482
02:59:54,358 --> 02:59:54,959
[SPEAKER_36]: Okay, cool.

2483
02:59:55,179 --> 02:59:56,220
[SPEAKER_36]: Hey, we know praying mantis.

2484
02:59:56,240 --> 02:59:59,663
[SPEAKER_36]: Hey, you're not supposed to kick around, Bull.

2485
02:59:59,683 --> 03:00:02,285
[SPEAKER_36]: What's that?

2486
03:00:02,305 --> 03:00:03,126
[SPEAKER_36]: Rangers, Rangers, what?

2487
03:00:03,146 --> 03:00:04,887
[SPEAKER_36]: Power Rangers, what do you know?

2488
03:00:06,008 --> 03:00:06,949
[SPEAKER_36]: Fire teenagers with attitude.

2489
03:00:07,813 --> 03:00:08,113
[SPEAKER_36]: What's wrong?

2490
03:00:08,173 --> 03:00:08,833
[SPEAKER_36]: What's going on?

2491
03:00:08,853 --> 03:00:10,254
[SPEAKER_36]: There's a bunch of disturbances going on.

2492
03:00:10,474 --> 03:00:10,734
[SPEAKER_36]: Oh, really?

2493
03:00:10,754 --> 03:00:11,274
[SPEAKER_36]: You better check it out.

2494
03:00:11,854 --> 03:00:14,115
[SPEAKER_36]: Oh, no, it's a monster that's terrorizing the city.

2495
03:00:14,135 --> 03:00:15,275
[SPEAKER_36]: What are you doing here?

2496
03:00:15,595 --> 03:00:16,256
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm the master of the world.

2497
03:00:16,296 --> 03:00:16,876
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm a giant pig.

2498
03:00:17,056 --> 03:00:18,596
[SPEAKER_36]: I eat stuff.

2499
03:00:18,776 --> 03:00:22,998
[SPEAKER_36]: Oh, no, we need to destroy him.

2500
03:00:23,018 --> 03:00:23,458
[SPEAKER_36]: Posing.

2501
03:00:23,498 --> 03:00:24,118
[SPEAKER_36]: Moving around.

2502
03:00:24,238 --> 03:00:30,880
[SPEAKER_36]: We are the Avengers, and we are going... Oh, yeah, well, uh, yeah, well, you weren't smart enough to call upon your Megazords now.

2503
03:00:30,900 --> 03:00:31,500
[SPEAKER_36]: Whoa, what the heck?

2504
03:00:31,640 --> 03:00:35,261
[SPEAKER_36]: Oh, no, we need to call upon the Megazord Megazord.

2505
03:00:35,281 --> 03:00:35,401
[SPEAKER_36]: Fusion.

2506
03:00:38,796 --> 03:00:40,877
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.
