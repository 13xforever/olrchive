WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
message for you sir, attention!

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

00:10.000 --> 00:19.000
you're listening to orange lounge radio, the monty talk and then some

00:19.000 --> 00:26.000
orange lounge may contain adult content, orange lounge may contain many four letter words

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
orange lounge may contain a scene of nudity

00:29.000 --> 00:32.500
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

00:32.500 --> 00:36.000
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex. In this episode...

00:41.000 --> 00:42.500
Hey, are there any balls down there?

00:42.500 --> 00:45.000
About the biggest berry you ever seen, Diggleberry.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
What's your favorite scary movie?

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
Showgirls. Absolutely frightening. What's yours?

00:52.000 --> 00:54.500
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

00:54.500 --> 00:57.500
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.

00:57.500 --> 01:00.500
Now's the time on Shrock, it's going to be dogs!

01:00.500 --> 01:04.000
I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.500
I know Kung Fu.

01:05.500 --> 01:08.000
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Why did they have to take the word day?

01:11.500 --> 01:15.500
No! What I expect for punishing positions is gentle.

01:15.500 --> 01:18.000
Hey!

01:18.000 --> 01:19.500
Dark Sakura.

01:19.500 --> 01:23.000
Shut up! Where's my gun? This is my boomstick.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Sky.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Come on, girls, it's time to drop the bomb.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Loki.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex with me.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
What kind of warped human being would find that funny?

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Orange Lounge Radio

01:38.000 --> 01:45.000
We are live, and this is episode number 37 for March 9th. No, it's not the 9th, it's the 16th of 2003.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Rob's doing the time warp again.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
Hello. You're tuned into Mamani Scene's most buzzin' radio station of all things Mamani.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Sounds like a fart.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.040
Heim is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

01:56.040 --> 01:59.160
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts. In this corner, the happiest bunny on the

01:59.160 --> 02:01.560
farm is Jamie Summers. You know her better as Dark Sakura.

02:01.560 --> 02:04.840
I'm not happy. In that corner, say hello to our Tech Masoloki.

02:04.840 --> 02:08.800
Hello. And with us here also in the studio tonight,

02:08.800 --> 02:10.040
we have? Here!

02:10.040 --> 02:15.600
Nobody! This is amazing! There is nobody else here tonight. It is just the three of us.

02:15.600 --> 02:19.360
This is craziness. Zero's not even here. He was supposed to be here tonight.

02:19.360 --> 02:20.360
Yeah, I guess.

02:49.360 --> 02:52.120
subwoofer and then we won't hear anything but I think they still get the

02:52.120 --> 02:58.180
buzzing even subwoofers off but I don't know so life sucks and you'll just have

02:58.180 --> 03:03.740
to bear with us tonight we'll do what we can but in the meantime we're gonna play

03:03.740 --> 03:07.700
some break songs and what songs are we gonna hear this break these are songs

03:07.700 --> 03:14.700
songs that no one listens to, but you're gonna do now, so enjoy. We'll be back.

05:37.700 --> 05:41.700
are

05:41.700 --> 05:45.700
are

05:45.700 --> 05:49.700
are

05:49.700 --> 05:53.700
are

05:53.700 --> 05:57.700
are

05:57.700 --> 06:01.700
are

06:01.700 --> 06:05.700
are

06:35.700 --> 06:36.700
Hey!

06:36.700 --> 06:37.700
Hey!

06:37.700 --> 06:38.700
Hey!

06:38.700 --> 06:39.700
Hey!

06:39.700 --> 06:40.700
Hey!

07:10.700 --> 07:17.700
Now let's go, now we're free

09:10.700 --> 09:36.380
Hello, hello, is this thing on testing?

09:36.380 --> 09:37.380
Testing one, two.

09:37.380 --> 09:41.380
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

09:41.380 --> 09:45.380
Hello? I don't understand this. This thing works.

09:45.380 --> 09:47.380
This thing reads like stereo instructions.

09:47.380 --> 09:48.380
Is this on?

09:48.380 --> 09:49.380
What the hell?

09:50.380 --> 09:54.380
Orange Lounge Radio. Broke-down ghetto bimani radio.

09:54.380 --> 09:56.380
WHAT THE F***

10:54.380 --> 10:57.860
I'm a

10:57.860 --> 11:00.860
I'm

11:00.860 --> 11:02.580
I'm

11:02.580 --> 11:05.700
we're supposed to be back before that was over positive about that now it is

11:05.700 --> 11:07.060
is that irony or what

11:07.060 --> 11:10.180
that you know broke down ghetto ass radio and then we can't even get our

11:10.180 --> 11:11.380
fuckin' volume to work

11:11.380 --> 11:13.180
We can't get it up! We're impotent!

11:13.180 --> 11:17.000
we actually what's funny is that during the break I was trying to fix the buzzing

11:17.000 --> 11:18.380
problem we've got tonight

11:18.380 --> 11:21.580
and I went behind the computer and kinda unplugged the splitter cuz

11:21.580 --> 11:25.260
Loki said, hey, look at the splitter, maybe something's wrong with that, and lo and behold,

11:25.260 --> 11:27.820
I went and I plugged it back in the wrong hole.

11:27.820 --> 11:29.380
I stuck it in the wrong hole!

11:29.380 --> 11:33.940
Okay, Rob, do you have hole priorities here?

11:33.940 --> 11:35.340
Yeah, I have hole problems.

11:35.340 --> 11:37.380
I think I'm dyslexic!

11:37.380 --> 11:42.740
Anyway, in that break of little-played Bimani songs, pretty controversial in the chat room,

11:42.740 --> 11:46.940
because every time one of them would play something, they'd go, hey, I play that!

11:46.940 --> 11:47.940
We had Changma...

11:47.940 --> 11:49.460
How many people really play Minimillion?

11:49.460 --> 11:50.540
Thank you.

11:50.540 --> 11:54.880
We had Chang Ma, would love this feelin', and then Minna Melon from 4th Style, which

11:54.880 --> 11:58.220
was also the background music in 3rd Style, if I'm not mistaken, blink blink.

11:58.220 --> 11:59.340
Yes, I think so.

11:59.340 --> 12:04.100
And then after that, the sampling masters with tablets, from 5th Style.

12:04.100 --> 12:07.380
And then Usama Kaboto with Presto, which is somewhat debatable, because actually a lot

12:07.380 --> 12:11.420
of people play that song, but what happened is I was actually looking for Five Regrets,

12:11.420 --> 12:12.820
and I couldn't find it.

12:12.820 --> 12:17.740
So then I tried to find, I was gonna put 1989 in, but a lot of people would have beat me

12:17.740 --> 12:29.500
up if I played 1989? And then we played about half of Sanctus before we decided to spare

12:29.500 --> 12:36.120
you all and come back. Which is interesting because Sanctus is in Dance Maniacs. If there

12:36.120 --> 12:41.220
was ever a song that just doesn't make sense in a Bomani game, Sanctus in Dance Maniacs

12:41.220 --> 12:52.540
I don't get every Kubota song could have been in keyboard mania yes presto was

12:52.540 --> 12:55.820
you are listening to Orange House radio and again we apologize for having some

12:55.820 --> 12:59.020
buzzing issues tonight we don't know what's causing it we've dissected

12:59.020 --> 13:03.900
everything going on about the only way I think I'd be a bee is angry for you know

13:03.900 --> 13:10.140
you to facing its song so I don't know what we can do about it we'll just have

13:40.140 --> 13:43.180
zero the orange lounge intern had a little get-together at his house

13:43.180 --> 13:47.580
and we decided to do a little bit drinking because it was mostly older folks who were

13:47.580 --> 13:48.780
there over 21 so we

13:48.780 --> 13:52.660
we decided to bust out a little bit of liquor. I had my one triple shot of

13:52.660 --> 13:56.460
that imported tequila. I had about half a glass of aftershock

13:56.460 --> 14:01.660
not a shot but half a glass. I had half a glass of aftershock. I had whatever it was that Irene

14:01.660 --> 14:04.900
made me do. Irene knew, you know,

14:04.900 --> 14:09.300
what I've been needing for about the past year and Irene made me a cocksucker which is

14:09.300 --> 14:14.860
Irish cream mixed with butterscotch schnapps and again, she didn't make me a shot. It's supposed to be a shot drink

14:14.860 --> 14:17.040
I was made a full glass

14:18.400 --> 14:21.440
Yeah, and I drank just about the whole thing except for a couple sips

14:21.500 --> 14:25.820
So needless to say after half a glass aftershock and that I was pretty fucked up

14:26.300 --> 14:30.520
So, I don't know. I was running around the house yelling things. I don't know what I was doing

14:31.520 --> 14:35.280
And then I fell asleep too after about 45 minutes

14:35.280 --> 14:37.280
And that was it.

14:37.280 --> 14:39.280
It wasn't long at all.

14:39.280 --> 14:41.280
I'm like, Rob's drunk, and I'm like, oh, ready?

14:41.280 --> 14:43.280
Shit, man.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.280
I didn't even finish sitting at the pads yet, and you're already drunk.

14:45.280 --> 14:47.280
Hey, wait a minute.

14:47.280 --> 14:49.280
Wait a minute.

14:49.280 --> 14:51.280
That's not fair, because you guys ran to the store.

14:51.280 --> 14:53.280
They did.

14:53.280 --> 14:55.280
Poor Ice Queen spent a bunch on liquor.

14:55.280 --> 14:57.280
Which reminds me, he's not here, and he's supposed to be.

14:57.280 --> 14:59.280
I need to call him and see where he's at.

14:59.280 --> 15:01.280
What did I do with my phone?

15:01.280 --> 15:03.280
You dropped it over the side of the desk.

15:03.280 --> 15:04.280
Did I?

15:04.280 --> 15:05.280
Oh, I sure did.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.280
Yes, you did.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.280
Let's call Ice Queen and see where he's at.

15:07.280 --> 15:08.280
On the air.

15:08.280 --> 15:09.280
We're not Broke-Ass Ghetto.

15:09.280 --> 15:11.280
Well, we've got nothing else to talk about tonight.

15:11.280 --> 15:12.280
Yeah, we do.

15:12.280 --> 15:15.280
We don't really ever do phone calls on the air because myself...

15:15.280 --> 15:16.280
We have two weeks till tournament.

15:16.280 --> 15:18.800
Do you want to talk about tournament while I call Matt?

15:18.800 --> 15:21.880
There's nothing going on at all.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.320
It's just dead.

15:23.320 --> 15:26.200
It's been like this for like the last three months.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.200
Nothing is happening.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.000
Well, March Madness isn't for two weeks.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.040
Yeah, I mean, we can talk about that next week because nothing's going to happen next

15:32.040 --> 15:33.040
week anyways.

15:33.040 --> 15:35.040
If one were you, Diggy?

15:35.040 --> 15:37.040
Sad. Nothing is happening.

15:37.040 --> 15:39.040
Shit, it went out. My phone sucks in here.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.040
Mine got three bars.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.040
You call Matt then.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.040
No. You can use my phone.

15:45.040 --> 15:47.040
Okay.

15:47.040 --> 15:49.040
Rob's gonna use my phone.

15:49.040 --> 15:51.040
I'm gonna use the phone.

15:51.040 --> 15:53.040
What else is new in your sim this week, Matt?

15:53.040 --> 15:55.040
That we were all playing on last night?

15:55.040 --> 15:58.040
Uh, just more stuff I downloaded.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.040
I've been trying to work on it.

16:00.040 --> 16:08.340
and stuff, but yeah. I've got up through Fifth Mix all ready to go. So, you know, it's ready

16:08.340 --> 16:12.740
for Monday. I'll probably upload this Monday. So, up through Fifth Mix. Pretty much everything

16:12.740 --> 16:18.620
you'd see in Bimani is stellar right now. I'm trying to get Max and Max2 done before

16:18.620 --> 16:24.220
maybe tonight. Have those up and maybe submit everything else. But, yeah, I ran into some

16:24.220 --> 16:28.800
problems with the DDR Extreme files because not just one person's making them, but actually

16:28.800 --> 16:34.420
a whole bunch of different people are making them and they're all out of sync or just awful

16:34.420 --> 16:39.880
and so I have to like, you know, fix those two and that sucks and I don't really want

16:39.880 --> 16:45.560
to and I probably won't, but yeah, there'll be more stuff and you know what, I don't have

16:45.560 --> 16:50.520
like no, I don't have a hidden page this week because I'm lazy and I just didn't get around

16:50.520 --> 16:52.400
to it and you know what, I don't care.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.400
Here's a shot.

16:54.400 --> 16:57.040
and uh...

16:57.040 --> 16:58.480
well shit man i mean

16:58.480 --> 17:02.760
well oh let's go to make let's make a hidden page of one sim file or uh... i

17:02.760 --> 17:06.080
don't know i'll release release like three hundred tomorrow

17:06.080 --> 17:08.040
yeah decisions

17:08.040 --> 17:13.240
so you can have the one or the three hundred one

17:13.240 --> 17:17.920
fine that's all i know what sim file i'm going to upload then let them move and that's it

17:17.920 --> 17:20.640
yay just to be the single sim file

17:20.640 --> 17:24.160
no i don't know i've got more stuff

17:24.160 --> 17:29.080
What else has been going on this week?

17:29.080 --> 17:33.860
Loki and I are planning a move and we decided on the apartment we want to go to, so the

17:33.860 --> 17:35.760
show is going to be moving.

17:35.760 --> 17:39.080
Yes, we have an orgasmic fountain at the new complex.

17:39.080 --> 17:40.080
Multiple orgasms.

17:40.080 --> 17:42.520
Yeah, it's like a multiple orgasm fountain.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.460
It flickers a little bit of water and then all of a sudden it's like gush, gush, gush

17:45.460 --> 17:49.180
and then back to a little bit.

17:49.180 --> 17:52.620
I lost my job.

17:52.620 --> 17:53.620
That sucks.

17:53.620 --> 18:01.820
Like Sierra Pacific Mortgage, there are 11,000 Olson Drive Rancho Cordova, CA, Suite 202.

18:01.820 --> 18:09.900
Go there with a grenade launcher aimed at the office of the shipping department.

18:09.900 --> 18:11.540
Why did you lose your job?

18:11.540 --> 18:12.540
I don't know.

18:12.540 --> 18:13.540
They never told me.

18:13.540 --> 18:15.480
It's a temp assignment.

18:15.480 --> 18:20.220
I think it's because I was being paid more than the other temps because I'm cooler than

18:20.220 --> 18:21.220
they are.

18:21.220 --> 18:23.100
So like, we don't want to pay her.

18:23.100 --> 18:25.100
She costs too much money and she's too damn good.

18:53.100 --> 18:54.100
Megamix?

18:54.100 --> 18:55.100
I've never heard of it.

18:55.100 --> 18:58.340
What the hell are you talking about?

18:58.340 --> 18:59.340
Let's see.

18:59.340 --> 19:01.700
I've never heard of what you're talking about here.

19:01.700 --> 19:02.940
There's a link, I think.

19:02.940 --> 19:03.940
I don't know.

19:03.940 --> 19:05.940
I don't know what the hell they're talking about.

19:05.940 --> 19:06.940
Megamix.

19:06.940 --> 19:10.140
Is this it?

19:10.140 --> 19:11.140
Here we go!

19:11.140 --> 19:15.900
Konami is, in fact, hard at work with a new dancing stage game, and this time it's for

19:15.900 --> 19:16.900
the PS2.

19:16.900 --> 19:21.380
They have licensed new songs for it, and the data is set to a May release in Europe.

19:21.380 --> 19:24.700
There are ten licensed songs in the mix, some of them are as follows.

19:24.700 --> 19:29.060
Ms. Dynamite, It Takes More Elvis, A Little Less Conversation

19:29.060 --> 19:33.420
Kylie Minogue, Love at First Sight The Sugar Babes, Freak Like Me

19:33.420 --> 19:37.820
Christina Milian, When You Look at Me The Cure, Love Cats

19:37.820 --> 19:38.820
That's crazy.

19:38.820 --> 19:42.940
It will also feature twenty original tracks created by the Konami development team.

19:42.940 --> 19:46.420
It will also have the normal features like Arcade Mode, Practice Mode, and Workout Mode.

19:46.420 --> 19:49.460
It will also feature a tutorial mode for beginners.

19:49.460 --> 19:54.660
Once again, I've been saying this before, it really sucks that Euromix stuff gets better

19:54.660 --> 19:58.860
music than our fucking U.S. mixes.

19:58.860 --> 20:03.860
They started putting licensed tracks in our first one, but ever since the get-go for Dancing

20:03.860 --> 20:07.940
Stage they've had licensed tracks that are exclusive to them, and I think that sucks

20:07.940 --> 20:08.940
ass.

20:08.940 --> 20:14.540
But yeah, the one day I'm not on the internet, there's stuff happening, and I hate that.

20:14.540 --> 20:19.540
It's like I'm on the internet all the fucking time. All day long on the fucking internet.

20:19.540 --> 20:27.540
Waiting for something to happen. Nothing ever happens. Then I turn it off, boom! Something happens. I hate that.

20:27.540 --> 20:33.540
Let's see what else. We're just leeching news right now from ddrmaniax.net.

20:33.540 --> 20:35.540
Oh yeah, DDR Big Brother.

20:35.540 --> 20:39.540
Giving a little credit where credit's due. What'd you have? You had a suggestion, Jamie?

20:39.540 --> 20:44.540
Failing lists work. I have their address. That's what I should do.

20:44.540 --> 20:47.540
Never mind. I was thinking of ways of getting revenge against that woman.

20:47.540 --> 20:49.540
Oh, Jamie's plotting revenge on her work.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.540
Former work.

20:51.540 --> 20:52.540
Former work.

20:52.540 --> 20:57.540
Also, DDR Media X is reporting, and this is kind of neat.

20:57.540 --> 20:59.540
DDR was on Big Brother.

20:59.540 --> 21:00.540
Oh, Dancing Stage.

21:00.540 --> 21:02.540
I'm sorry, Dancing Stage was on Big Brother.

21:02.540 --> 21:07.540
Not Big Brother in the U.S., but Big Brother because Big Brother in the U.S. only airs in the summer.

21:07.540 --> 21:12.160
but it was on Big Brother in Norway.

21:12.160 --> 21:18.360
They had their very own dancing stage machine, and they have this little picture here when

21:18.360 --> 21:23.640
they're all playing on the machine, and one chick in the back says, fuck the machine,

21:23.640 --> 21:25.240
I'm going to play on the Nordic track.

21:25.240 --> 21:26.240
That's what she's doing.

21:26.240 --> 21:31.320
And then there's this bald guy looking on going, what are they doing?

21:31.320 --> 21:34.540
And then there's these two chicks kind of dancing, and it's obvious that they're...

22:34.540 --> 22:38.540
It sucked, and then coming onto message boards today, guess what? It sucked.

22:40.540 --> 22:44.540
Shock? MTV programming sucks? Wow.

22:44.540 --> 22:45.540
Shock of shocks.

22:45.540 --> 22:46.540
Oh my god.

22:47.540 --> 22:48.540
When did that happen?

22:48.540 --> 22:54.540
Who knows? Maybe y'all. And knowing MTV, don't worry. If you didn't see it, they'll re-run it 50 times.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.540
So just, you know, look in your TV guide.

22:56.540 --> 23:00.540
The downfall of MTV began with the banishment of Martha Quinn.

23:00.540 --> 23:03.540
The loss of Kennedy, I concur.

23:30.540 --> 23:36.140
You know what sucks about Road Rules though?

23:36.140 --> 23:37.140
It's old.

23:37.140 --> 23:38.140
It's fucking old.

23:38.140 --> 23:40.380
They do the same thing every year.

23:40.380 --> 23:42.500
Same shit, new location.

23:42.500 --> 23:47.300
There's some fag, there's some bitch, there's some black guy, and they all fight all the

23:47.300 --> 23:48.300
time.

23:48.300 --> 23:49.300
That's what they do.

23:49.300 --> 23:50.300
The show's getting old.

23:50.300 --> 23:52.780
And then there's like the one person who goes, okay.

23:52.780 --> 23:53.780
Yeah.

23:53.780 --> 23:54.780
And then there's the virgin.

23:54.780 --> 23:58.780
You know, the chick that's like, oh, I'm a Mormon and I'm never going to do anything

23:58.780 --> 23:59.780
bad.

23:59.780 --> 24:02.180
And she gets fucked three ways from, you know, yesterday.

24:02.180 --> 24:04.740
I still want to be on the real world.

24:04.740 --> 24:06.860
I want to be on the real world, so I should be on the real world.

24:06.860 --> 24:10.700
See, I wouldn't start fights with anyone, but I'd just be totally strange.

24:10.700 --> 24:12.100
I'd just be the weird guy.

24:12.100 --> 24:16.260
The guy that sits in the corner like, dude, that guy's weird, man.

24:16.260 --> 24:18.060
I don't know what it is, but it's weird.

24:18.060 --> 24:21.660
Like, they come to talk to me, and you just, like, start screaming, you know, weird shit

24:21.660 --> 24:22.660
like that.

24:22.660 --> 24:26.220
Anybody that listens to this show knows that you'd be the crazy racist and homophobe.

24:26.220 --> 24:29.220
I'm not the crazy racist, homo-folk guy.

24:29.220 --> 24:30.220
Fucking A man.

24:30.220 --> 24:33.220
Hello man, I'm going to be living with you.

24:33.220 --> 24:34.220
Shit man.

24:34.220 --> 24:37.220
That's why they have auditions for these shows.

24:37.220 --> 24:41.220
See, if I were on any of these programs, I would be sitting in the back of my Game Boy.

24:41.220 --> 24:44.220
And the Game Boy reading a book.

24:44.220 --> 24:45.220
We should do something though.

24:45.220 --> 24:48.220
We should do our own reality show.

24:48.220 --> 24:51.220
Orange Lounge Reality Radio.

24:51.220 --> 24:55.220
This kind of is reality radio because it's not like we talk about Bimani ever.

24:55.220 --> 25:02.020
No, I mean we should get a video camera and go on a weekend road trip or something and

25:02.020 --> 25:04.780
videotape it and post it on the internet.

25:04.780 --> 25:06.260
This is what we do.

25:06.260 --> 25:10.860
This is the thing is I tried to do that for Cyberbeat and it came out really really bad.

25:10.860 --> 25:11.860
Did you have a video camera?

25:11.860 --> 25:13.460
I don't even think it ever aired.

25:13.460 --> 25:15.180
No, I didn't have a video camera.

25:15.180 --> 25:17.180
See if we can get a video camera and go.

25:45.180 --> 25:46.180
I'm so excited.

25:46.180 --> 25:47.180
So we'll see.

25:47.180 --> 25:51.740
Well, you realize that if we get to go, you know who else is going to be there?

25:51.740 --> 25:52.740
Who?

25:52.740 --> 25:54.740
Dan is going because he's a manager.

25:54.740 --> 25:55.740
Woohoo!

25:55.740 --> 25:56.740
Well, that's cool.

25:56.740 --> 25:57.740
Then you'll get to go.

25:57.740 --> 26:00.980
For all the people who remember my fiance on our lovely radio show here, you get the

26:00.980 --> 26:02.460
Dan experience.

26:02.460 --> 26:03.460
Very cool.

26:03.460 --> 26:10.260
So if that happens, we will do an E3 reality show, but we're still kind of hanging out

26:10.260 --> 26:11.700
to see if it's going to happen or not.

26:11.700 --> 26:12.700
I mean, I don't know.

26:12.700 --> 26:16.300
I don't know, that sounds hopeful but I'm kind of like I don't know, but we might have

26:16.300 --> 26:17.300
an in.

26:17.300 --> 26:22.980
And it's very exciting so I'm moist with anticipation, as should all of you, because the E3 rules.

26:22.980 --> 26:24.860
Why are you messing with my shoes you're like-

26:24.860 --> 26:29.240
So yeah, DDR on Big Brother.

26:29.240 --> 26:30.900
I think you should try out for Big Brother.

26:30.900 --> 26:32.180
I would try out for Big Brother.

26:32.180 --> 26:33.900
I think I'd be awesome on the show.

26:33.900 --> 26:37.080
I'd f***ing win Big Brother.

26:37.080 --> 26:42.140
Big Brother is the one where they have no computers, no news, no TVs or nothing.

26:42.140 --> 26:46.340
just in a house with cameras watching them 24 hours a day, and they just all have to

26:46.340 --> 26:47.340
like co-exist.

26:47.340 --> 26:50.500
I would do nothing but read the whole time.

26:50.500 --> 26:51.500
I'd have withdrawals.

26:51.500 --> 26:52.500
Ahh!

26:52.500 --> 26:53.500
Shaky!

26:53.500 --> 26:56.180
They don't let you bring books.

26:56.180 --> 26:57.180
So...

26:57.180 --> 26:58.180
I'll bring a book somehow.

26:58.180 --> 26:59.180
I'll write a book.

26:59.180 --> 27:02.180
You sneak a book in your bra.

27:02.180 --> 27:03.180
I'll write a book.

27:03.180 --> 27:05.340
I draw the arrows on the ground.

27:05.340 --> 27:08.020
What are you doing, man?

27:08.020 --> 27:11.860
You know, and what's funny about Big Brother, at least in the U.S. anyway, Big Brother in

27:11.860 --> 27:17.620
the US, the first season was shit. It was absolute shit because it was totally not cast

27:17.620 --> 27:18.620
well at all.

27:18.620 --> 27:19.620
Interviewer2. Did they make them do anything?

27:19.620 --> 27:22.460
Man 2. Yeah, they have to do stupid little challenges every week, but like in the first

27:22.460 --> 27:28.700
season some of their challenges were having to make papier-mâché. It was shit. But then

27:28.700 --> 27:31.560
the second season it started to get a little better. I didn't watch the second season because

27:31.560 --> 27:34.600
the first season was so bad that I wouldn't watch the second season. But I heard that's

27:34.600 --> 27:38.220
what started getting better. And then this last season was really good, last season was

27:38.220 --> 27:39.220
good.

27:39.220 --> 27:46.220
finally got some... you're a bitch! You made Pippi Longstocking out of my shoes! Anyway,

27:46.220 --> 27:49.780
yeah, the last season of Big Brother was pretty good. And I could see, totally see them doing

27:49.780 --> 27:52.740
something like this, where they bring it, then that's what they do, is they just kind

27:52.740 --> 27:57.620
of drop a toy on them, like, and then in the next week, they would probably have to do

27:57.620 --> 28:01.500
like whoever's the best at DDR gets to win, gets to go out for dinner.

28:01.500 --> 28:05.660
Oh man, I would love that. It's like they do the same thing for that show and you're

28:05.660 --> 28:08.620
on the show. Dude, NC, I would... They're all playing in there all, okay, who's the

28:08.620 --> 28:13.840
best of all start busting up like oh my god I just don't even try you know I'd

28:13.840 --> 28:17.560
fake it like for that whole week I'd fake it that I really suck at DDR and

28:17.560 --> 28:22.660
then like the last day of it I just go fucking nuts win the dinner and

28:22.660 --> 28:25.460
everybody would hate me and I'd get voted out suddenly dawned on to me as

28:25.460 --> 28:29.780
you're there you know paying back yeah it's like it just clicked I don't know

28:29.780 --> 28:35.600
oh my god it's not like I don't play this oh oh yeah Jamie's gonna fix my

28:35.600 --> 28:43.480
shoes. I have some more really important Bahmani news, or Bahmani related news. It's not really

28:43.480 --> 28:47.900
directly Bahmani news, but it's about a Bahmani artist. I have some really important Bahmani

28:47.900 --> 28:55.040
news that we need to take care of. And it's about a lady who is in Max 2, and you probably

28:55.040 --> 29:00.040
know this song. She's Ginger Spice, and she did a song called It's Rainin' Men. You all

29:00.040 --> 29:05.380
know that song. She's not a Spice girl, but she used to be. But there was big revelations

29:05.380 --> 29:08.360
about Jerry Halliwell this week.

29:08.360 --> 29:10.320
And this is the way the story goes.

29:10.320 --> 29:17.600
Ex Spice Girl Jerry admits she had a lesbian fling.

29:17.600 --> 29:21.280
So former Spice Girl Jerry Halliwell says she has had a brief encounter with another

29:21.280 --> 29:24.560
woman but denies she's a lesbian.

29:24.560 --> 29:26.360
So she's not joining tattoo or anything.

29:26.360 --> 29:29.040
Remember, try it but don't like it.

29:29.040 --> 29:33.440
The singer who was dated, fellow pop star Robbie Williams, told Thursday's Sun tabloid

29:33.440 --> 29:36.560
that after the fling she quickly realized that she was not gay.

29:36.560 --> 29:40.320
I had a little lesbian thing, she said, adding the encounter with an unnamed woman had been

29:40.320 --> 29:42.560
part of experimenting.

29:42.560 --> 29:46.540
She refused to pinpoint the date, but said it was somewhere between the ages of sixteen

29:46.540 --> 29:47.540
and thirty.

29:47.540 --> 29:53.160
Yeah, it's sometime between now and never.

29:53.160 --> 29:56.180
It was just a drunken moment.

29:56.180 --> 30:00.840
She also says, you wanna go home and have sex with me?

30:00.840 --> 30:08.680
The singer also said she was not in a relationship but present.

30:08.680 --> 30:12.560
I would like to be in a loving relationship, but it has to be with someone who is trustworthy

30:12.560 --> 30:15.840
and kind and sweet, and also my equal, she said.

30:15.840 --> 30:18.000
And a man.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.340
Halliwell or Ginger Spice, as she was known during her time with the band, left the Spice

30:21.340 --> 30:26.380
Girls in 1998 amid reports- Or the only cute Spice Girl that wasn't Butch.

30:26.380 --> 30:27.380
Amid reports of her squabbling.

30:27.380 --> 30:29.280
She looked like a drag queen.

30:29.280 --> 30:30.280
Whatever.

30:30.280 --> 30:33.640
The 30-year-old singer is currently hosting the U.S. television beauty and talent show

30:33.640 --> 30:38.280
All-American Girl, which, by the way, funny enough, All-American Girl was the name of

30:38.280 --> 30:43.500
Margaret Cho's show, a much, much different program, also on ABC.

30:43.500 --> 30:47.980
Can you believe they blatantly just took that name, especially after Margaret Cho's movie

30:47.980 --> 30:50.180
about the hell she went through on that show?

30:50.180 --> 30:52.460
Well, you know what's funny is they're having a...

30:52.460 --> 30:53.820
There's a microphone in my face.

30:53.820 --> 30:56.940
Howard Stern is actually, you know that show Are You Hot?

30:56.940 --> 30:57.940
Yes.

30:57.940 --> 31:03.020
the producers of that show because it was his idea.

31:03.020 --> 31:08.260
If you go to SmokingGun.com, which is my favorite website on the entire internet, you can read

31:08.260 --> 31:14.960
the court documents of Howard Stern filing the lawsuit with ABC because apparently he

31:14.960 --> 31:18.860
used to do this bit on his show and it's been a long time since I've listened to Howard

31:18.860 --> 31:19.860
Stern in it.

31:19.860 --> 31:20.860
I never even saw that.

31:20.860 --> 31:23.580
I used to watch the E-Show and I used to listen to it in the morning, but I never saw this

31:23.580 --> 31:24.580
segment.

31:24.580 --> 31:25.580
But I guess it's been on for a while.

31:25.580 --> 31:31.220
Was the Examiners or the Examiners, what was it called, the, I don't know, but they would

31:31.220 --> 31:34.260
I think it was called the same thing, actually No, it wasn't called Are You Hot, it had something

31:34.260 --> 31:36.580
else Still, I even thought that they were ripping

31:36.580 --> 31:39.740
that off of that website, Are You Hot or Not, I mean, it's exactly

31:39.740 --> 31:44.540
They suit them too, because they have that, I've never watched the show because I don't

31:44.540 --> 31:49.420
watch crap, but like, they have this big sign from a picture I saw that says hot or not,

31:49.420 --> 31:52.380
and then the contestant is standing under it and I guess it lights up if they're hot

31:52.380 --> 31:58.020
or not, and I guess, uh, uh, what's his name, that one guy, oh god, what's his fucking name,

31:58.020 --> 32:04.020
that guy, he was on chips or something I think? Eric Estrada? I think he's a judge. I don't

32:04.020 --> 32:08.780
know. Well they have, uh, Lorenzo Lamas as a judge. Oh, him, nevermind, I'm getting Eric

32:08.780 --> 32:12.380
Estrada mixed up with Lorenzo Lamas. I don't know how or why, but I do. Yeah, I don't like

32:12.380 --> 32:18.740
women with fake breasts. Uh, wait, wait, hold on, let's flashback for a second here. Uh,

32:18.740 --> 32:25.740
Weren't you just, weren't you dating, or say, married to a Playboy model, uh, you know,

32:25.740 --> 32:26.740
just to fill you in?

32:26.740 --> 32:27.740
Guess what?

32:27.740 --> 32:29.740
They weren't real.

32:29.740 --> 32:30.740
Not real.

32:30.740 --> 32:31.740
Fake breasts.

32:31.740 --> 32:34.740
Breasts aren't supposed to be like solid plastic.

32:34.740 --> 32:39.740
I mean, when she hits the wall, they're supposed to kind of like give a little bit, not like

32:39.740 --> 32:41.740
crush through them.

32:41.740 --> 32:42.740
So-

32:42.740 --> 32:44.740
It's a surgical flotation device.

32:44.740 --> 32:46.740
It's a bath toy.

32:46.740 --> 32:54.220
In case of Wanderlanding, the bosom may be used as a flotation device.

32:54.220 --> 33:00.060
So this begs the topic that we need to do a new segment here on OrangeLawnsRadio, called

33:00.060 --> 33:01.060
DDR Hot or Not.

33:01.060 --> 33:04.180
And basically the way this would work is you're going to send a picture, but it has to be

33:04.180 --> 33:06.540
a picture of you playing DDR.

33:06.540 --> 33:10.100
Not just a generic picture, it has to be a picture of you playing DDR, or any bimani

33:10.100 --> 33:11.100
I guess would work.

33:11.100 --> 33:14.900
And no, I don't know.

33:14.900 --> 33:18.180
Are we not accepting any nude photos of people playing DDR?

33:18.180 --> 33:22.300
I don't want to see that shit unless you really are hot.

33:22.300 --> 33:26.300
Only if you're really, really hot, and people tell you that on a daily basis.

33:26.300 --> 33:27.780
Then nude photos are okay.

33:27.780 --> 33:31.340
But if you don't get told that every day, don't send it.

33:31.340 --> 33:37.380
So you're just going to send it to orangeloungeradioatyahoo.com, and we'll let you know how you rank, okay?

33:37.380 --> 33:41.100
And Howard Stern can sue us if he wants, but you know, you can't get blood out of a turnip.

33:41.100 --> 33:45.580
So send your photos, graphs of you playing DDR and we'll let you know if you're hot or

33:45.580 --> 33:46.580
not.

33:46.580 --> 33:52.700
And what we'll do, huh?

33:52.700 --> 33:56.600
And remember that all pictures submitted become the property of Orange Lounge Radio.

33:56.600 --> 33:59.480
We say that because we're going to put your pictures on our website.

33:59.480 --> 34:03.660
Because this is radio, obviously, other people are going to need to see these somehow.

34:03.660 --> 34:07.740
So we're going to put your pictures up on the site so that people can access them.

34:07.740 --> 34:09.860
Brilliant, huh?

34:09.860 --> 34:20.980
And Jamie says, it reminds us of an old segment from Undersedation Live, the kind of show

34:20.980 --> 34:21.980
that came before this.

34:21.980 --> 34:24.380
Have anybody ever listened to Undersedation Live?

34:24.380 --> 34:26.480
You need to listen or we'll shoot you.

34:26.480 --> 34:29.300
There was an old segment that also included pictures submitting.

34:29.300 --> 34:30.980
Oh, excellent question.

34:30.980 --> 34:35.060
USFVB asks, what if he whips his cock out at the end of the routine?

34:35.060 --> 34:36.060
Good question.

34:36.060 --> 34:37.060
You want to know what?

34:37.060 --> 34:38.060
What?

34:38.060 --> 34:45.940
No offense to any of our guys listening, but I think that as far as organs go, that the

34:45.940 --> 34:47.900
penis is the weirdest looking thing ever.

34:47.900 --> 34:48.900
Why do you think that?

34:48.900 --> 34:51.300
They just start ugly.

34:51.300 --> 34:52.940
Just because they're just like there?

34:52.940 --> 34:57.700
I don't want someone to whip out their cock on film, I'm sorry.

34:57.700 --> 35:03.740
Well what if somebody whipped out their cock and then in an amazing yaoi fetish film another

35:03.740 --> 35:04.740
guy started sucking it.

35:04.740 --> 35:05.740
Would that be okay?

35:05.740 --> 35:06.740
Okay.

35:06.740 --> 35:07.740
Okay.

35:07.740 --> 35:11.740
Oh, you hypocrite!

35:11.740 --> 35:13.740
What?

35:13.740 --> 35:16.740
What?

35:16.740 --> 35:18.740
If you want...

35:18.740 --> 35:22.740
Okay, so send those pictures to orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.

35:22.740 --> 35:23.740
They have to be of you playing DDR.

35:23.740 --> 35:26.740
And no nudes unless you're told that you're hot every single day.

35:26.740 --> 35:30.740
And you have to have proof. Somebody has to send us an affidavit.

35:30.740 --> 35:35.740
I am not retarded. I think that it's the strangest looking...

35:35.740 --> 35:38.740
I didn't say I didn't like cock.

35:38.740 --> 35:40.740
It's just funny looking.

35:40.740 --> 35:42.740
I can just see it now.

35:42.740 --> 35:44.740
You know, that's really weird looking.

35:44.740 --> 35:48.740
Oh yeah, thanks. Whoa, that does it for me.

35:48.740 --> 35:52.740
Oh come on, even Dan agrees with me.

35:52.740 --> 35:54.740
It's like Carrot Top.

35:54.740 --> 35:56.740
He's funny looking, but everybody loves Carrot Top.

35:56.740 --> 35:58.740
No wait, nobody loves Carrot Top.

35:58.740 --> 36:00.740
How about Yahoo Serious?

36:00.740 --> 36:02.740
Yahoo Serious funny looking.

36:02.740 --> 36:04.740
But everybody loves Yahoo Serious.

36:04.740 --> 36:09.740
I like it because he's Australian. He's funny. He plays with the Tasmanian Devils.

36:09.740 --> 36:12.740
It's funny Australian stuff.

36:12.740 --> 36:15.740
Excellent question. What if you tell yourself you're hot every day?

36:15.740 --> 36:17.740
No, it doesn't work. Sorry, dumb fly.

36:17.740 --> 36:19.740
It's just like those people that tell themselves they can sing.

36:19.740 --> 36:22.740
Alright, so that's something we'll look forward to doing either next week.

36:22.740 --> 36:27.740
Probably not until next week because we'll have to upload those photos, but, you know, something you guys should do.

36:27.740 --> 36:31.740
Yeah, if anyone actually sends them. I think we'll get a couple.

36:31.740 --> 36:36.740
I'll post on the forums that we're doing it to. That's always a good way of getting people to participate.

36:36.740 --> 36:41.740
So, moving along. What else do we have to talk about?

36:41.740 --> 36:46.740
I don't know. I'm just not happy today.

36:46.740 --> 36:51.740
You're just not happy today? What's up, Logan?

36:51.740 --> 36:56.740
Ah, there's microphones coming every which way. Well, actually, in two weeks,

36:56.740 --> 37:01.740
We're probably going to see the last, I think, of the DER Extreme Unlocks.

37:01.740 --> 37:03.740
I think. I can't remember our off-hand.

37:03.740 --> 37:10.740
I think there's thirty, well, number-wise, as far as the unlocks go, there's a total of thirty different unlocks.

37:10.740 --> 37:16.740
I mean, even though, like, number thirty is, like, three different songs or three different whatever.

37:16.740 --> 37:20.740
But there's only, like, thirty total, and we're up to twenty-four right now.

37:20.740 --> 37:24.740
So, in two weeks, we're going to have the rest of the songs, supposedly.

37:24.740 --> 37:29.740
So, which ought to make it very interesting because in two weeks from now is March Madness.

37:29.740 --> 37:31.740
Yes, March Madness.

37:31.740 --> 37:36.740
So, I wonder if we're going to see any last minute routines to some of these new songs.

37:36.740 --> 37:40.740
March Madness will be broadcasting live, by the way, on Orange Lawn's radio.

37:40.740 --> 37:44.740
For those of you not in NorCal or SoCal driving up here or whatever,

37:44.740 --> 37:48.740
if you're too far away to come to the tournament in person, you can attend online.

37:48.740 --> 37:53.740
Just visit our website and we'll be doing a live broadcast all day long, both days.

37:53.740 --> 37:57.580
So that does mean in two weeks, the normal live program here on Orange Lounge will be

37:57.580 --> 38:00.700
preempted by that coverage, so we won't be on live.

38:00.700 --> 38:04.940
And chances are we're actually going to finish up over there probably around seven o'clock,

38:04.940 --> 38:06.220
so there won't be a show in two weeks.

38:06.220 --> 38:09.140
But we'll be here next week, of course.

38:09.140 --> 38:10.140
Yeah.

38:10.140 --> 38:14.340
If anyone expects me to do a fuck off afterwards, you can fuck off.

38:14.340 --> 38:18.100
Because I'm going to be dead.

38:18.100 --> 38:22.820
Had a tournament here last night, says Ninjosakekoi.

38:22.820 --> 38:25.940
It was interesting.

38:25.940 --> 38:28.100
Was that the tournament in Albany by chance?

38:28.100 --> 38:30.940
Because I know there was a big one that was supposed to go on the East Coast yesterday

38:30.940 --> 38:32.580
and I haven't heard anything about that.

38:32.580 --> 38:33.940
I'm wondering how it went.

38:33.940 --> 38:36.340
If somebody wants to tell me about how that went.

38:36.340 --> 38:37.340
Certainly.

38:37.340 --> 38:39.420
I'll fill you all in on that.

38:39.420 --> 38:42.860
This particular tournament was in Hickory, North Carolina.

38:42.860 --> 38:44.560
Cool.

38:44.560 --> 38:49.700
You know, if any of you folks out there on the East Coast, other places, mid coast, basically

38:49.700 --> 38:55.140
anywhere outside of California you want to do some tournament coverage you want

38:55.140 --> 38:58.620
to maybe take a tape recorder over and talk to some people there talk to the

38:58.620 --> 39:02.020
winners talk about the tournament put together a little bit like 10 minutes

39:02.020 --> 39:06.300
long little package about the tournament well we'll air it here on the Orange

39:06.300 --> 39:10.660
Lawns radio we put a call out a while back on live journal but nobody sent us

39:10.660 --> 39:17.660
anything, so fuck em!

39:40.660 --> 39:46.660
The last time I actually looked at GameFacts.com was back in April when they had Xbox.com.

39:46.660 --> 39:48.660
XboxFacts.com.

39:48.660 --> 39:58.660
Oh, the April Fools joke? I think right after that, during the summer, they did the top 64 characters of all time.

39:58.660 --> 40:07.840
No, what I don't like is this new show on Tech TV, it's like this Microsoft-only show,

40:07.840 --> 40:13.100
it's like all Microsoft propaganda, stupid Nazis.

40:13.100 --> 40:14.100
What is it about?

40:14.100 --> 40:15.100
I've never seen this.

40:15.100 --> 40:20.920
It's like extra tips for Microsoft products and Microsoft this and Microsoft that, and

40:20.920 --> 40:27.040
it's all about Microsoft and how wonderful Microsoft is and how Microsoft heals the world

40:27.040 --> 40:34.040
and what not and it sucks ass. Remember that parody they put out by the Microshaft corporation

40:34.120 --> 40:41.120
Whimblows? Yeah. They suck. Anyways, I think what we're going to do is go to a quick break

40:44.680 --> 40:48.480
and then we're going to come back and get to the FUs of the week. And it will definitely

40:48.480 --> 40:53.560
be short this week because there's only three of us here in studio. There's lots of you.

40:53.560 --> 40:57.400
But there's lots of you, so you can go ahead and send those FUs over to Sky via private

40:57.400 --> 41:00.320
message in the channel.

41:00.320 --> 41:01.320
Let's see.

41:01.320 --> 41:03.200
Question, we have another Hot or Not question.

41:03.200 --> 41:06.160
I only have a video of me playing Legend of Max.

41:06.160 --> 41:07.160
Is that acceptable?

41:07.160 --> 41:08.160
Sure.

41:08.160 --> 41:09.800
Sure, but please don't email that.

41:09.800 --> 41:14.040
If you could put that on the web somewhere and give us a link and email us the link,

41:14.040 --> 41:15.040
that would be great.

41:15.040 --> 41:16.320
Don't send us...

41:16.320 --> 41:21.080
Or there's programs out there that take screen caps of videos that can cut a frame right

41:21.080 --> 41:22.080
out of it.

41:22.080 --> 41:23.080
You can use that too.

41:23.080 --> 41:34.080
Yeah, so please don't email us video, but email us like a link to the video or take a screencap of it, because we don't want any files over like 200k or something or else our email box will fill out too damn quick!

41:35.080 --> 41:38.080
Alright. What do we want to hear this break? What do you guys think?

41:38.080 --> 41:39.080
Entrance.

41:39.080 --> 41:44.080
Entrance. And we already... No, we didn't do entrance. Entrance is the one you said I should have played that we didn't do.

41:44.080 --> 41:45.080
Okay?

41:48.080 --> 41:52.080
Evan is the metallic 57 gray? I don't even know if I can find that one. I'll see if I can find it.

41:52.080 --> 41:57.080
What style was Entrance on?

41:57.080 --> 42:02.080
I think someone else might have just showed up. We had the door go. Let's see who opens up the door in a little bit.

42:02.080 --> 42:09.080
Tengo no kis, Tengoku.

42:32.080 --> 42:35.440
All right, we'll be back in a little bit. Send us your FUs please

43:02.080 --> 43:07.080
Make me do it any way

43:11.080 --> 43:17.080
I don't know what to do

43:17.080 --> 43:23.080
I don't know what to do

43:23.080 --> 43:30.080
I don't know what to do

43:30.080 --> 43:36.080
Kishine ga takigatou gozaimasu

43:36.080 --> 43:42.080
Kissing the heavens, kumono hanenu

43:42.080 --> 43:50.080
Kissing the heavens, no te deii tenemori

47:20.080 --> 47:49.080
Please

47:49.080 --> 47:56.080
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

48:49.080 --> 48:51.080
That's the coolest thing ever.

48:51.080 --> 48:53.080
I haven't seen a Bjork video.

48:53.080 --> 48:55.080
We can fix that after the show.

48:55.080 --> 48:56.080
Oh, great. Thanks.

48:59.080 --> 49:00.080
Human behavior, the one with the bear.

49:00.080 --> 49:03.080
I saw the one where she's jumping around and just being stupid, though.

49:03.080 --> 49:07.080
It's like, she's just bouncing off her couch or something like that.

49:07.080 --> 49:09.080
I don't remember a Bjork video with a couch in it.

49:09.080 --> 49:10.080
I don't know. We'll see.

49:10.080 --> 49:11.080
Like, I know.

49:12.080 --> 49:16.080
Okay, so, also here we have DDRholic. Say hello.

49:16.080 --> 49:17.080
Say hello.

49:17.080 --> 49:20.760
Hello, good evening everybody and always fashionably late, here I am.

49:20.760 --> 49:24.280
It's alright we forgive you because we know it was a lot of partying the night, or last

49:24.280 --> 49:26.280
night there was a little bit of a party.

49:26.280 --> 49:27.560
No, it was so cool, it was great.

49:27.560 --> 49:29.000
How late did the party go till?

49:29.000 --> 49:30.600
Because we left about 3.30.

49:30.600 --> 49:34.520
It probably went till about 4, 4 o'clock.

49:34.520 --> 49:35.520
Yeah.

49:35.520 --> 49:36.520
Okay, cool.

49:36.520 --> 49:37.520
Yeah.

49:37.520 --> 49:40.520
I would have stayed by 4 this morning.

49:40.520 --> 49:46.040
I got cold because his house has no heating at the time.

49:46.040 --> 49:48.040
There is a little story to this.

49:48.040 --> 49:57.040
Oh, okay. The heater was on last night at like 100 degrees, so I went and turned it down and then I wake up this morning and somebody turned it all the way off.

49:57.040 --> 50:05.040
It was comfortable and I turned it down to like 80 and then I wake up and it's just totally off because some stupid moron turned it off.

50:05.040 --> 50:07.040
Probably one of the jerks in the back.

50:07.040 --> 50:11.040
Yeah, because it doesn't help that the heater is in the back of the house and there's none in the front.

50:11.040 --> 50:15.160
And you know when you're at a party, you know when you're at a real party, when like all

50:15.160 --> 50:18.240
these people are showing up that you don't fucking know.

50:18.240 --> 50:20.040
That was happening last night.

50:20.040 --> 50:24.320
All these people were showing up, and what's even weirder, they know you, but you don't

50:24.320 --> 50:25.320
know them.

50:25.320 --> 50:26.320
Oh, that's weird.

50:26.320 --> 50:27.320
I took a nap.

50:27.320 --> 50:28.320
Sorry.

50:28.320 --> 50:29.320
Oh, no problem.

50:29.320 --> 50:32.720
I think most everybody took a nap at some point.

50:32.720 --> 50:35.560
I took like a three hour nap.

50:35.560 --> 50:40.720
I like took over that that love seat and didn't move for a while except like to

50:40.720 --> 50:44.320
wake up every so often and when I woke up I'd be fully awake and then I'd be

50:44.320 --> 50:50.640
certainly tired again. Well like okay it was it was kind of retarded at the end

50:50.640 --> 50:56.720
because all the kids in the back were screaming and being dumb and coming over

50:56.720 --> 50:59.760
and taking the couch so none of the adults had places to sit like Shane

50:59.760 --> 51:04.020
slept on the damn couch after you left so nobody could sit there and then Loki

51:04.020 --> 51:09.220
had his spot and I had my couch and that was it and it was they were still yelling at five

51:09.220 --> 51:17.020
o'clock in the morning those damn kids and then that was funny that call it preceded

51:17.020 --> 51:23.580
the party from that stupid bitch oh yeah hold on okay this is like the best thing which

51:23.580 --> 51:28.260
is actually pretty funny that Loki bitched it up okay Matt and Loki are at my house we're

51:28.260 --> 51:33.180
We're setting up Lucky's Pads for a sim, and this girl calls.

51:33.180 --> 51:38.340
I won't say her name, but she knows who she is because I know she's listening right now.

51:38.340 --> 51:41.980
She calls, and she's just trying to lay these guilt trips on me, and I'm like, I want to

51:41.980 --> 51:42.980
get off the phone right now.

51:42.980 --> 51:45.980
And she's all, no, I don't want to let you.

51:45.980 --> 51:50.580
Then she tells me about how some truck drove by her and threw porn at her or something.

51:50.580 --> 51:53.860
That's a bad thing?

51:53.860 --> 51:55.860
I want someone to throw porn at me.

51:55.860 --> 52:04.860
And so I'm like, okay, and then she's like starting to get mad at me so I just flat-call her a bitch on the phone like four times and they're over there laughing.

52:04.860 --> 52:05.860
Language, now now.

52:05.860 --> 52:06.860
I'm sorry.

52:06.860 --> 52:08.860
Bitch.

52:08.860 --> 52:09.860
Thank you.

52:09.860 --> 52:15.860
Anyways, so they're over there laughing and I'm trying not to laugh and then she's, and I'm like, I just want to go.

52:15.860 --> 52:16.860
So you get annoyed with me.

52:16.860 --> 52:19.860
I said, I want to go because I'm about to have a party and I need to get ready for it.

52:19.860 --> 52:21.860
So you can hang up anytime.

52:21.860 --> 52:22.860
And I said, oh, I can?

52:22.860 --> 52:24.860
And I just hung the phone up.

52:24.860 --> 52:30.220
That sounds worthy of me.

52:30.220 --> 52:33.940
That's interesting because it's like really mean, yet kind of humorous at the same time.

52:33.940 --> 52:34.940
I don't know.

52:34.940 --> 52:40.300
Also here, hiding in the corner, snacking on food, eating a lot, getting really fat.

52:40.300 --> 52:46.180
Eating a lot, getting really fat, of course, well, I have some catching up to do with that.

52:46.180 --> 52:48.580
Say hello to the ice queen, cold as always.

52:48.580 --> 52:49.580
That's right.

52:49.580 --> 52:51.500
Or as I should say, frigid as always.

52:51.500 --> 52:52.500
Well, that too.

52:52.500 --> 53:01.500
Of course, you know, it's odd though because I don't really seem to remember much about last night except getting home at like 5 o'clock in the morning. Go figure that.

53:01.500 --> 53:06.500
He picked up a prostitute on the way home.

53:06.500 --> 53:12.500
I was very interested in driving while I was asleep.

53:12.500 --> 53:19.500
So, we're going to catch you guys. Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead for your shot.

53:19.500 --> 53:26.100
We're going to catch you guys up on what you missed so far.

53:26.100 --> 53:29.180
There's not a whole lot of Bahmani news this week, so we don't have a lot to talk about,

53:29.180 --> 53:30.180
surprise, surprise.

53:30.180 --> 53:34.000
However, it did come out in the news that Jerry Halliwell, who did It's Raining Men

53:34.000 --> 53:39.420
from Max 2, admitted she had a lesbian fling.

53:39.420 --> 53:40.420
Ooh.

53:40.420 --> 53:46.740
It's Raining Boobs and the ever-important Dancing Sage Megamix coming out for the PS2.

53:46.740 --> 53:48.740
This, The Cure.

54:16.740 --> 54:39.740
Joe, by the way, we have to offer a word to our sponsors.

54:39.740 --> 54:53.740
This episode of Orange Jones Radio is brought to you by Propel, by Pizzeria Pretzel Combos, and the El Sebroso Guata Chip, Guacamole Chips.

54:53.740 --> 54:56.740
They're tortilla chips with guacamole already in them.

54:56.740 --> 54:58.740
They're chips that are the color of boogers.

54:58.740 --> 55:02.740
For those of you... What did you say? Loki made it funny.

55:02.740 --> 55:04.740
It's the guacamole-dilt chip.

55:04.740 --> 55:09.740
For those of you too lazy to dip your chips, that's amazing. Only in America.

55:09.740 --> 55:12.740
We will play Gamelan a couple in a little while.

55:12.740 --> 55:16.740
Alright, let's do the FUs of the Week. You guys ready?

55:16.740 --> 55:20.740
Alright, we got a whole bunch. Chat room sent me a whole bunch.

55:20.740 --> 55:25.740
So, plenty of things to rant about tonight. Let's get it started.

55:25.740 --> 55:45.740
My first recipe of the week is for what I mentioned earlier towards Sierra, Pacific Mortgage, and in particular, Shanda, who is the supervisor. Her name is Shanda Ramsey-Wallace and I don't care, I'm not a professional.

55:45.740 --> 55:48.740
She can go burn in hell.

55:48.740 --> 55:50.740
Because I had been asking for feedback.

55:50.740 --> 55:51.740
How am I doing?

55:51.740 --> 55:53.740
What do you need me to do differently?

55:53.740 --> 55:55.740
What can I do to improve what I'm doing?

55:55.740 --> 55:57.740
She's like, oh, no, you're doing fine.

55:57.740 --> 55:59.740
No, no, no, no, no.

55:59.740 --> 56:01.740
Just like that, by the way.

56:01.740 --> 56:05.740
And then I get a call at 9 a.m. today

56:05.740 --> 56:08.740
saying that I lost my assignment with my job.

56:08.740 --> 56:11.740
And I'm going through 10 pages to see if there's anything new.

56:11.740 --> 56:13.740
And the other thing about this,

56:13.740 --> 56:18.740
I need to go to the doctor really bad, and I've needed to go for practically a year now.

56:18.740 --> 56:27.740
And I was really, you know, counting on being made permanent this week so that I could go to the doctor and get all that crap taken care of.

56:27.740 --> 56:36.740
But no. So, you know, I have to say this, is that what I'm going to do when I finally find out what's wrong is I'm going to send her my medical reports and I'm going to say,

56:36.740 --> 56:50.740
You can pay for half of this. I should probably sue her for, uh, you know, for damages. And, you know, with our current court system, I'd probably win. But, um, I'm not that petty. Um, but no.

56:50.740 --> 56:53.740
I like how you add that in there, but P.S. I'm not that petty.

56:53.740 --> 56:56.740
No, I'm not petty and fake like she is.

56:56.740 --> 57:06.740
But anyway, her office is toward the front on the opposite side where the UC Davis Medical Center is at 11000 Olson Drive in Rancho Cordova.

57:06.740 --> 57:12.740
It's upstairs on the right side of the building, and her office is the window office.

57:12.740 --> 57:14.740
She can go in there and set it on fire.

57:14.740 --> 57:22.740
Although I am intentional making a bunch of those very bot-speed, like her vomit flavor, and dirt, and sardine, on her desk.

57:22.740 --> 57:25.740
I am going at five in the morning to pick up my stuff.

57:25.740 --> 57:29.740
Of course she's there, so that I don't have to see her ugly, lying face.

57:29.740 --> 57:30.740
But guess what?

57:30.740 --> 57:35.740
They said the temperature apparently likes me so much they're giving me another salmon instantly.

57:35.740 --> 57:36.740
Yay.

57:36.740 --> 57:37.740
They're done shaking back.

57:37.740 --> 57:39.740
Next?

57:39.740 --> 57:43.740
Moving on, uh, Loki, what do you have to say?

57:43.740 --> 57:53.900
I had some dumb bitch in front of me today, actually I don't know who it was, but it was

57:53.900 --> 58:00.900
some dumb bitch driving a 30 and a 45, and there was no red lights or anything, it's

58:00.900 --> 58:04.940
not like you're slowing down for anything, you're just slowing down for the hell of it.

58:04.940 --> 58:11.340
So I got pissed, and drove by them and flipped them off, and yelled at them and stuff because

58:11.340 --> 58:13.340
I couldn't hear you, but it felt good.

58:13.340 --> 58:18.340
Um, have you the stupid teenagers that were at this gandhi last night?

58:18.340 --> 58:20.340
Um, okay, let's see.

58:20.340 --> 58:22.340
Number one, you're a nerd.

58:22.340 --> 58:24.340
Okay, yeah, that's acceptable, okay?

58:24.340 --> 58:26.340
Number two, you're not goth.

58:26.340 --> 58:27.340
Don't try to be...

58:27.340 --> 58:31.340
I don't know what the hell they think, but what's the step of coolness?

58:31.340 --> 58:35.340
Okay, let's see here. I'm at the bottom rung, so the next thing I gotta be is goth.

58:35.340 --> 58:40.340
Oh, wait, um, you know, the whole goth trend, you know, that was so ten years ago.

58:40.340 --> 58:44.560
And now you're just annoying and you look stupid and then the guy with the wannabe mohawk

58:44.720 --> 58:51.960
I'm gonna spike up my hair in the middle and it's gonna look like shit, and I'm gonna be all coop because I yeah

58:51.960 --> 58:54.920
So there's all these kids there are like wannabe punk

58:54.920 --> 59:00.160
which is sad because it doesn't take much to be punk, but they're not quite there yet

59:00.160 --> 59:04.460
And then they're playing DDR, and you'd think okay these wannabe punk guys

59:04.460 --> 59:08.300
Maybe they listen to rock maybe they're you know trying to get through the whole punk thing and that kind of thing

59:08.300 --> 59:14.440
They start playing nori nori nori and fucking like, you know shit like that. It makes no sense

59:14.720 --> 59:17.900
I'm just you're annoying and you're in my way

59:17.900 --> 59:21.800
So then I had my turn coming up on the machine to get a coin line of all fucked up

59:21.880 --> 59:27.640
So I have my turn this dump this dump dumbass kid comes up to me. He's like, you know, what's my turn?

59:27.680 --> 59:32.460
I'm like, fuck you, man. I was waiting for people. I you know, I counted it and everything

59:32.460 --> 59:36.480
Well, I don't know if I've been on here waiting here for two minutes of 15 minutes

59:36.480 --> 59:41.480
I'm like, oh, it was my fucking turn, get out of here.

59:41.480 --> 59:43.480
So, it was annoying.

59:43.480 --> 59:46.480
So basically just stupid people at Scandiac because they suck.

59:46.480 --> 59:48.480
Um, F you to...

59:48.480 --> 59:52.480
Would you like to take a nap, by the way, because you're a stupid kid in that place with your hair.

59:52.480 --> 59:58.480
F you to the stupid bastard that was there also last night that wanted to do some improv turning.

59:58.480 --> 01:00:02.480
He's like, dude, let's have a turning man for people. Yeah!

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:17.480
I know that kid, and he used to try to hang out with me because he thought I was so cool because I played PDR, and I was teaching him little stuff, and now he thinks he likes PDR guys because they're trying to get tournament going everywhere he goes, even if he's by himself. He'll ask random people.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:36.640
what else we've got on the list here i know there's a bunch of shit um

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:40.560
at the police because i don't know why it takes about eight people to you know

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:41.960
if you uh...

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:44.280
patrol the fucking like

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:47.320
greenback lane i was driving here and i thought the police cars

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:52.040
drive-by not take after anything

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:58.800
what he's doing thank you for giving out my address on there

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:00.160
I'm kidding, God.

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.080
I took a street.

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:04.480
What the hell, man?

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:06.720
Fucking A, dude. It's stupid.

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:08.120
Yeah, so, so they're just...

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:15.120
I don't understand, they're like complaining, we don't have enough money to, you know, support our police force, and it's understaffed, and...

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:21.440
What the fuck? You have like eight people traveling around here, you know, pulling over speeders in a traffic area.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:24.940
You're not gonna speed up those cars in front of you, you dumbasses.

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:28.780
want to do something important like stop robberies or drive-by punchings or

01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:30.780
something like that

01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:32.060
something like

01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:33.160
do something

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.780
uh...

01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:39.780
at the my website

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:42.780
that's close

01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:45.220
and uh...

01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:52.220
uh... i don't know that that's all i have right now because my memory

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:54.700

01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:06.020
smoky simp

because last night the party i didn't play at all

01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:11.420

01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:15.740

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:31.420
F you the cypher game pads because they suck ass

01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:34.720
okay what the hell's the point of putting frickin

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:40.840
they've got not even no kind of gauge of sheet metal they have underneath them but there's no fucking way it's gonna hold any sort of weight whatsoever

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:45.740
I took the feet off the bottom of these things so they wouldn't bend and they still fucking bend

01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:48.500
and the wires are coming out of what you know it's it's like

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:51.840
jim and my i'd thought might have to build really shitty

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:56.220
i mean i look at that point all my god man with i'd just fully fuck those up

01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:59.660
but now these are just really fucked up so

01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:04.100
yet don't buy safer game pads if you're going to buy my mind by anyone else is

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:08.580
not there

01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:11.940
uh... a quick question in the chat room wonder what someone would like trying to

01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:14.580
play d r when they're really really drunk

01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:18.460
last time i was in vegas i did that a circus circus i got really fucked up at

01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:22.380
the star trek experience

01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:25.200
which i know it's like the nerdiest thing i've ever said on the show but i

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:26.660
swear to god it's true

01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:29.900
i got drunk at the star trek experience then walked back

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:31.380
to the circus circus

01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:33.380
and then played uh...

01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:34.900
played afro-nova

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:38.260
afro-nova trick i remember the song even though which is amazing is there no

01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:38.980
struck

01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:41.960
i played afro-nova trek on the machine that's right in the middle of like the

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:43.260
little kid area

01:03:43.260 --> 01:04:02.260
No, I realized when I was in Reno and I was at the Atlantis and I played their Max 2 machine. I play better when I'm drunk than when I'm not drunk.

01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:14.260
I was, uh, I was, it was the DDR Freak Moderator strip. Me, an iguana girl, an islander. All three of us and two of my friends were there who lived in Las Vegas.

01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:23.260
At the Star Trek experience, between the three of us, we had three warp core breaches. And, uh, no, two and a half. Two and a half.

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:40.260
And we went on the ride, went on the ride again, and then we took a cab over to Circus Circus and played on the USA machine that was up there with the broken, I mean broken arrows on the left side, I'm sorry, on the right side, and I was trying to do love to me.

01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:45.260
And then, like, we called, um, Understanding Live, the voicemail, because we were drunk.

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:48.260
And, um, one more after you, just remember it again.

01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:51.260
Fuck you to the stupid DDR stream roulette.

01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:57.260
Seven times yesterday, I got one away from the Legend of Max, and it wouldn't fucking give it to me.

01:04:57.260 --> 01:05:01.260
I've got the timing down perfect, yet you won't give it to me.

01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:04.260
Why even fucking have it in the roulette if you're not gonna give it to me?

01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:08.260
You stupid assholes, I can't wait two weeks to play this damn song.

01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:10.260
I wanna play it now!

01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:17.240
I wouldn't play roulette so you know I can get cutie chaser five times for freaking white lovers or whatever the fuck that stupid

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:19.240
Song is it sucks ass

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:21.280
Shouldn't be in there

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:23.720
Tell us what you really think logy. Oh

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:28.040
Yeah, cutie chaser morning mix. Why did they take anything from OHA?

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:34.200
You know DDR. It's just dumb, but did you say Omaha DDR? Oh, hi dumbass

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:43.200
That's not Omaha. I swear to God, I thought you said Omaha. I'm like, hey, we got friends there.

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:49.200
Yeah, do you know of a DDR Omaha mix? Do you know of one? Because, you know, I'm...

01:05:49.200 --> 01:06:00.200
That's what I thought you said, and I'm like, in my mind, I'm like, God Loki's a retard. There's no Omaha mix.

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:06.200
Rob's still drunk in his head, like, Rob's still drunk. I'm taking over.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:09.200
No, Rob's too drunk to be over her host.

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:13.200
No, I'm, uh, I'm not doing my FUs yet, lady.

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:16.200
If you even think about it, I can hear you.

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:24.200
Also, um, I forgot to finish that story. When you play DDR drunk, it's like, every time you jump, I remember,

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:37.720
I remember you jump up and it's like, I'm flying and then you come down like a rock.

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:39.120
That's how it's different when you're drunk.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.120
That's all I remember.

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:46.160
When I do this, I always spin on them and I get really dizzy.

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:48.480
I played drunk on your old pads.

01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:52.360
I would also like to give a nephew the lack of sex.

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:53.360
Thank you.

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:57.360
by the way, I played drunk on my pads and he fell over and that was funny.

01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:02.360
Alright, let's get to the rest of the room, shall we?

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:04.360
Who's first?

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:06.360
Who else is first?

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:08.360
You're first, go.

01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:13.360
Okay, a couple of FUs, one of them is to these guac-a-chips because they taste like guac-a-shit.

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:18.360
I don't care if anybody else likes them, I think they taste like crap.

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:25.360
Combos are fucking good. Eat one! Okay, eat like eight, okay?

01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:31.360
No, anyways, another F.U. I have is, of course, to the little punk, wannabe punk brigade over at Scandia.

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:35.360
They're stupid and annoying. They don't know what the hell a coin system is.

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:39.360
And they think they're really cool because they can pass, like, exotic ethnic on light.

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:43.360
Are you trying to get Legend of Max on roulette?

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:46.360
No, not at all.

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:53.360
And yeah, especially that little mohawk kid comes up to me four fucking times after I tell him every new time.

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:55.360
So how does a token line work?

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:57.360
I'm like, just put your damn token up.

01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:01.360
And the fourth time, I just walked off. I didn't even say anything.

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:05.360
Whose tokens are those? Because I want to take them.

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:08.360
And I just said there were some guys who didn't take them.

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:13.360
Another F.U. I have is to, we'll call them drunk kids.

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:19.360
last night. I've already seen kids are trying to get drunk and stupid and I'm going to kill

01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:26.360
them whenever I find them. And another one is those fucking pads because they should

01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:33.360
be registered as lethal weapons. I moved the fucking pad twice and I got cut four times

01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:38.360
because the sheet metal is so sharp on the side. I was sitting there on the pad and all

01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:42.360
of a sudden I just noticed I was bleeding off my hands for no reason. Not to mention

01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:47.360
Not to mention that, but the fact that the pads are bent in half, that the one side doesn't really work too well.

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:52.360
It got bent in half just from one game of playing on them.

01:08:52.360 --> 01:08:59.360
And then that and the fact that the wires are coming out, and yeah, that's up.

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:07.360
And one last one is to Bel Air for having fucking two things left of the Sharanov Triple Black,

01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:13.360
And one of them is missing a fucking bottle, and so we can only get one and have to resort to, like, substituting.

01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:15.360
That was the worst thing ever.

01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:18.360
And that's all, because I don't want to talk no more.

01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:22.360
Next.

01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:24.360
Okay, it's my turn.

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:27.360
Uh, first, hi DarkSessia, thanks for saying hello.

01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:30.360
Uh, hi Irene, how are you? Are you out there?

01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:32.360
Not angsty enough.

01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:38.360
Okay, my fuck yous aren't that great, but here we go.

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:41.360
Well, yeah, okay, we'll start with that.

01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:46.360
Fuck yous to Laundromat, because going to Laundromat is not fun.

01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:51.360
Today was my first experience in years to go to a Laundromat, and it wasn't too bad.

01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:57.360
I was in a hurry, though, so it just kind of sucks having to share your laundry with the whole world.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:00.360
So anyway, back to other things.

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:02.360
Uh, fuck you to my computer.

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:04.360
It's not working properly.

01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:07.360
I can't get it to work hardly at all.

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:11.360
Oh, yeah, okay, thanks to me.

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.360
I did my good deed for the week.

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:19.360
I gave 0x my extra 32 megabytes of RAM for this computer,

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:23.360
which only had 32 megabytes of RAM,

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:26.360
so I gave him an extra one, and now it has 64 megabytes of RAM,

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:28.360
and now it works nicely.

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:31.860
So, that's my good deed for the week.

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:34.860
I know, it was like, yeah, it was extra.

01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:37.360
What's that?

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:39.860
You have 512 megabytes of RAM.

01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:41.360
512 of my old computer.

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:44.860
My current one's like 80-something DDR RAM now.

01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:46.860
Whoa, that's nice.

01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:49.360
This is how it came.

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:50.860
Yeah.

01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:53.860
Well, yeah, right now my computer is not functioning,

01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:56.360
and I think there's a virus on it, and I can't tell,

01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:59.360
I can't get online yet, but I don't know, I'll have to figure it out.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.360
Your computer has never had a virus scanner?

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:11.360
Yeah, I think I got something stupid on there, but I'll have to figure it out.

01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:19.360
Anyway, and fuck you to the Kmart on Stockton Avenue, because they have... Stockton Boulevard, excuse me.

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:26.360
There are people that work there that really suck. They can't do anything, and they never have enough people at the cash register.

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:28.360
It's a Kmart.

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:33.360
Yes, I know. It's a Kmart. It's going downhill fast.

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:44.360
And fuck you to guys, and I won't say why. I just hate guys. You know, guys suck. Sorry to all you guys out there who are decent guys.

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:48.360
But guys who really suck, fuck you.

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:51.360
And yeah, fuck you to lack of sex.

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:54.360
Guys who suck, here's my number.

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:59.360
And I'm done. Let's see your fucking math.

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:03.360
I have to agree with Rob, fuck you to lack of sex.

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:09.360
It's been so long I don't even remember what a penis looks like, except my own.

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:15.360
Oh, great, that's lovely. Thank you.

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:26.360
Also, I have to back up Jamie's fuck you to her boss, because bosses everywhere suck, and they should all be frickin' tarred and feathered and thrown out into a street naked.

01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:36.360
Well, with the exception of Lokai's boss, because I guess Lokai's boss is wrong, but other than that, fuck not having a computer and fuck not having...

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:38.360
Well, actually, fuck having a job, period.

01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:40.360
Having to have a job to make money.

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:44.360
And that's about it this week.

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:52.360
You say fuck having a job. Can I say fuck not having a job?

01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:55.360
I should rephrase that. Fuck having to have a job to have money.

01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:57.360
Or say fuck having your job.

01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:59.360
Well, that too. That works.

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:01.360
People need to pay me because I'm cool.

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:05.360
Pay me for the privilege of being in my presence.

01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:09.440
I'm just going to become a porn star. You know why? Because you're getting paid to have

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:14.200
sex. That's two of my big problems right there.

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:24.200
I don't want to go buy porn to see Robin. Well, you'd see my dick on the cover, so you

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:27.760
know, you'd be all, I better stay away from this. Rob's naked on the cover.

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:32.080
What if you're one of the extras? And you're not on the cover.

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:39.080
I am much better than a fluff boi.

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:06.080
We're gonna start with Ninja Usagi Koe.

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:11.080
Our first F.U. goes to rocks in the woods that aren't fat people friendly.

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:15.080
The second will go to Namco for no free play. They suck.

01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:23.080
The third will go to all politicians for being so fucking stupid and sending us to war and just ignoring other possibilities because they're so fucking power hungry.

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:25.080
Arigato ho hanemate.

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:27.080
F.U. to Freedom Fries.

01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:04.080
what that used to be like.

01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:04.080
people who get in Jamie's way when she drives.

01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:36.040
I'm sorry, this is from Skyline DC-505.

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:41.360
Fuck you to the DMV for failing me during the drive test for a dangerous maneuver.

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:45.000
Stupid, stupid bitches, and fuck you to little kids in Scandia.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:49.160
I would like to request more information on what that dangerous maneuver was.

01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:51.040
So send that over, please.

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.480
Dr. Tuya says, continued F.U. to being single.

01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:54.520
I need a date, dammit.

01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:57.820
Fuck banging my foot on the vacuum, it freaking hurts.

01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:03.320
And fuck the United States Postal Service, Angel Snail Mail didn't arrive yesterday.

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:06.140
I haven't gotten any either.

01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:10.960
Oh, God, here comes Snub Dispenoid.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.640
Okay!

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:16.340
First off, fuck drivers training once again, fuck it up the peehole.

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:20.140
I'm fucking sick of Red Asphalt 3 and that sick fuck that treated human beings

01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:21.780
like they were fucking toys.

01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:25.080
I swear to God, I don't want to hear some child-raping 40-year-old say,

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:29.780
Oh, what a waste, when the person's fucking brains are plastered on the freeway.

01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:32.780
I thought it was hilarious. I was laughing my ass off during that video.

01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:34.780
Well, you're a sick fuck.

01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:37.780
If you ever want to see a good comedy, watch any of the Red Ass Waltz.

01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:40.780
It's, like, better than Spike and Mike.

01:17:40.780 --> 01:17:42.780
They're all, Oh my God, it's so horrible!

01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:48.780
And they just show a dead person on, like, me, not a steering wheel.

01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:49.780
True.

01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:53.660
little kids who told the people at my table to shut up. The only person that can tell

01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:57.700
me to shut up is the fucking teacher, not some stuck-up, cousin-humping piece of shit

01:17:57.700 --> 01:18:02.180
that lives in Natomas. Fuck them. Also, fuck you to that stupid shitwad that thinks Judo

01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:05.900
is kicking someone in the nuts as hard as you can and throwing their limp body over

01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:10.260
you. That's not Judo, that's fucking mental retardation. That's ghetto Judo, man. My ball

01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:16.540
still fucking hurts, so fuck you, buddy. And fuck you to the fucking asshole bassoon player

01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:20.800
that left me all alone in my orchestra. I have to play all of my parts alone and I can't

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:23.880
play contrabassoon because we won't have a regular bassoon if I did.

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:28.520
Hey, if your band has a contrabassoon clarinet, I'll play it. I'll volunteer.

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:31.680
Fuck him right in his little bitch-ass ear. I fucking hate his worthless ass. Fucking

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:37.680
shack of shit. Fuck it. Fuck it all. Fuck. Like bloody fucking hell, fuck it all.

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:44.660
23rd Magus says, Fuck you to being broke. Probably can't enter March Madness. I cry.

01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:48.940
you to Angel being in Japan and not here in SAC. I cry again. Fuck you to my parents not

01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:55.060
getting me and having their heads stuck up their asses. I cries more.

01:18:55.060 --> 01:19:01.420
Rice says, fuck you bad mic with buzzing. I agree. Fuck you slow, weak, move faster.

01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:08.020
Fuckity fuck fuck fuck, that is all. Black Lab says, more FUs. Did I even get the

01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:13.140
first ones? I don't remember reading Black Lab FUs. Well, he says number six. I don't

01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:15.140
Remember seeing one through five, but whatever

01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:22.520
Fuck the shitty internet connection in the dorms and fuck chipotle burritos. They're damn too. Damn good. I had them four times this week

01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:26.300
Like this whole chipotle trend, okay

01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:33.540
I like the chipotle burritos, but you know what they make me sick every time I eat them. Isn't it pronounced chipotle?

01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:37.060
Chipotle or something like that, okay

01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:41.000
Anybody seen that um that one check in the box commercial great

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:48.000
D.D.R. Mike would like to say, fuck you to Concord.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Skyline says that his dangerous maneuver was that he messed up in a left turn.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:01.000
What did you do, you turned right in a left turn or something?

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Or did you try to turn left from the right turn lane?

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:11.000
When you turn left and you're with a driving instructor, you're not supposed to powerslide.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Yeah, I would just like to remind everybody out there that real-life driving is not like Initial D. You don't want to drift.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:28.000
You know what? Everything that I learned, it was funny the whole time I was taking JB home, I'm like, okay, what I just did, don't do that.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:35.000
that

01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:41.020
jonah sent us some uh... lovely a fuse

01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:42.340
over e-mail

01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:43.400
explicit

01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:50.400
might know by the show forces fuck you too

01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:55.480
yes definitely

01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:59.820
But he would like to help console himself through that by doing a little bit of venting.

01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:03.760
He says, F.U. to my Calc teacher, and he draws a little asky middle finger.

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:07.180
She does not understand what I was going through and told me there's no chance I have to pass

01:21:07.180 --> 01:21:09.180
the class, so I decided to withdraw.

01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:10.180
I can't believe this.

01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:14.900
This is just sick to fail a person whose, well I guess this is what I'll say, whose

01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:18.340
dad just passed away and missed a midterm, so fuck her for that.

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:22.820
And another F.U. to the asshole who was pissing me off so badly at a situation like this.

01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:26.240
Like I told him I wasn't in the mood to get pissed off that he intended to do so anyway.

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:27.560
That's just disgraceful.

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:31.440
As much as I want to rip his skull so bad the teacher was there and I don't want to

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:32.440
get in trouble from the cops.

01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:35.880
Oh yeah, F you to the cops because they won't let me rip this asshole apart.

01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:38.480
Saying I'd be arrested.

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:40.360
He'll be gone for a little while but not retired.

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:46.560
Well you know what the whole deal with midterm is, I'm assuming that's college courses.

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:53.560
take that up with the dean of that particular college and they should take care of it.

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:59.360
Alright, some good advice from Jamie because Jamie knows how to kick ass and take names.

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:04.060
Flak Lab, we got the other FUs. He says, Fuck my upcoming finals, they suck. Fuck legal

01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:08.320
battles. My girlfriend's plans to visit me during her spring break are currently fucked

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:12.020
over because her aunt is in legal trouble with her business. Fuck the engineering two

01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:16.240
building computer labs for closing at 10pm on Friday nights. I had a project due at midnight

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:21.880
that I couldn't finish because they closed early.

01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:25.880
Fuck flat bike tires. I got one on Friday night and on my way home from working on my

01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:29.540
project thus forcing me to walk a good distance in the rain and dark.

01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:35.260
Fuck power outages. One happened Friday night and it screwed up my computer and iPod settings.

01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:42.260
Oh and Skyline says he didn't see the oncoming traffic when he made the left turn.

01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:50.940
justin circuit wants to add FU to comcast for still not fixing my email if this next

01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:52.020
request doesn't fix it

01:22:52.020 --> 01:23:00.260
i told you what you need to do with them you just let me call them okay i'll get your email

01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:03.680
back let me call them

01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:08.900
and last but certainly not least we have uh mennequin ego jazz for saying fuck you to

01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:15.900
teachers who complain about noise in the hallways. If you want quiet, close your fucking door.

01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:22.900
Yeah, if you don't like noise, you probably shouldn't be teaching because you're loud.

01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:26.060
Well, that remark about teachers not teaching, if they didn't teach, they wouldn't be able

01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:29.100
to do anything because you figured there are teachers because they can't make it doing

01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:32.140
what it is that they teach. Oh, my God. One of my high school teachers,

01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:39.080
She would always go, this is so chaotic, didn't you have any Christmas the whole time?

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:42.360
And she would always, every time anyone would say anything, and someone in the back of the

01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:45.640
hall said something, she always blamed it on the front three people in the row, but

01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:49.160
the funniest thing happened like two years after I left.

01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:54.400
She left the classroom, okay, and see everyone really didn't care for her just because she

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:58.800
was so nuts already, but she left the classroom to go take care of something, and when she

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:02.800
When she got back, all the students had turned their desks around backwards.

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:06.800
And if I remember correctly, they even moved her desk to the opposite side.

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:09.800
When she came in, she had a breakdown.

01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:11.800
And apparently went on hiatus.

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:15.800
No, it's funny. I've never really had any teaching experience, even though I think that'd be fun.

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:20.800
But I used to do marshaling for Cuzar, which is obviously pretty much no work at all.

01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:23.800
But you have to do a little brief, which is kind of funny.

01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:28.800
I did one for this one girl who was losing her voice. This is after I quit working there.

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:34.800
But my favorite way I entered the brief, because everyone was talking, was,

01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:36.800
Shut the fuck up!

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.800
And then everyone was like, Huh? What?

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:42.800
And then I did my brief, yelling at them.

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:46.800
It was cool because I couldn't get fired because I never worked.

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:51.800
The best teacher thing I ever did was when I was in eighth grade.

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:56.800
You knew she was a big drug, you could only tell because she would eat sunflower seeds

01:24:56.800 --> 01:25:00.480
in class and then just fall asleep.

01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:05.440
One time we made a big old packaging tape, we made a big ball out of it, threw it at

01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:08.360
the chalkboard right behind her head.

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:12.160
She jumped like 10 feet and my friend and I personally made it our mission to get her

01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:15.480
out of the class and we drove her to rehab.

01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:19.960
We drove her nuts and we found her drug buddy one day in class and that was all the evidence

01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:20.960
we needed.

01:25:50.960 --> 01:26:02.960
This one, I don't know what prompted me to do this, but some girl in 4th grade that I used to talk to, I would only talk to her, no one else, I'd talk to her with a fake Spanish accent.

01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:07.960
And then at the very last day of the year I'd talk to her and she'd be like, what happened to your voice? What are you talking about?

01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:09.960
It was hilarious.

01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:12.960
That's so stupid.

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:19.960
the

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:24.000
you're telling me about this yesterday back in late sixth grade when i was like

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.280
parent even

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:26.920
he was sixth grade

01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:29.960
are very late it was like after they built this one is going to raise the

01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:31.880
risk of being like bright

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:36.120
neon like god-awful i don't even know what was on them

01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:37.080
sixties

01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:41.560
and things they're almost like empty air pants with his role i kind of like

01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:45.040
Silk, so they weren't like silk or anything, but I used to wear those all the time

01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:48.760
I think they were like the coolest thing and I used to be awesome at German dodgeball

01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:53.440
I was just like yeah, look at me in my pants

01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:57.840
I remember

01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:00.720
In 11th grade I took advanced English

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:06.240
And I laid my, I would sleep all day in my classes and my teacher wouldn't care

01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:12.320
there, because I would always pass my tests, and I never read the book. I just happened

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:18.760
to retain everything that she said in class while I was asleep. Proof that the subliminal

01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:24.200
learning tapes might actually have worked. Of course, I could learn in my sleep, and

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:30.360
again high school is a joke. In Spanish class, when we'd watch a movie, we'd steal the tests

01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:33.520
for the next two or three months, and we stole midterm and sold it at the beginning of the

01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:40.080
In chemistry class, I took the later afternoon chemistry class, and we would go whenever

01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:43.640
we had substitute teachers and were left busy work to do, you know, just those forms fill

01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:44.640
out.

01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:50.600
We would go into the assignment box, because we would have to, we had this little stack

01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:54.780
of inboxes that we would put in our papers, we would take the early, the morning class

01:27:54.780 --> 01:28:00.020
as papers, and take the person who we know always got the answer right, and copy off

01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:12.700
The only thing I can remember from high school that was funny was one time, this is a very

01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:19.700
short story, I was in class, I was in ROTC in high school and my best friend Becky, she

01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:24.100
gave me, she was like, come here Anita, come here, come here, let me show you something.

01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:28.300
She had a Playgirl magazine.

01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:32.140
So we were looking at this in class and we were both sat in the back of the classroom

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:35.860
and we were all giggling and everything and checking it out and one of the other girls

01:28:35.860 --> 01:28:38.020
that was sitting in front of me, she was like, what are you guys doing?

01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:41.620
She's all checking it out and she saw me and she was like, ooh, I'm going to tell, I'm

01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:42.620
going to tell, I'm going to tell.

01:28:42.620 --> 01:28:45.660
And we started making those big ruckus because I was trying so hard not to get caught because

01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:49.040
I was one of those kids that never got in trouble.

01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:53.580
And here I am with a Playgirl magazine in ROTC class.

01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:55.700
Well luckily our teacher...

01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:56.980
What grade was this again?

01:28:56.980 --> 01:28:58.980
This was like, I was a sophomore in high school.

01:28:58.980 --> 01:29:00.980
I'm gonna tell him, I'm gonna tell him, I'm gonna tell him.

01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:03.980
Dude, that bitch should have fucking gotten slapped aside.

01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:07.980
I'm gonna tell him, cause I'm the teacher's pet 911.

01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:10.980
I want to be the teacher's best friend.

01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:14.980
And if she would ask me, I would sleep with her.

01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:19.980
Oh my god, I don't know if it was quite like that, but she was just acting up.

01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:24.980
If she bent over to kiss my ass, I would be sold there.

01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:37.980
Well, anyway, what happened was nothing. I didn't get caught. The teacher came close to check him what was going on, but he looked, and I think he realized what was going on, and he was like, I don't want to go there, and he just walked away.

01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:42.980
He walked up to the girl and was like, let me tell him, let me tell him!

01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:46.980
I used to read comic books and geometry.

01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:54.220
I have a story about a geometry teacher, and I have a picture of him actually with me,

01:29:54.220 --> 01:29:55.220
not here with me.

01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:57.220
I should guess they're in the car, I can't find them.

01:29:57.220 --> 01:30:01.700
My teacher looked like a treasure troll with no hair.

01:30:01.700 --> 01:30:04.780
What color was the hair?

01:30:04.780 --> 01:30:05.780
Oh, no hair.

01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:07.980
Well, he had, you know, he was bald on top.

01:30:07.980 --> 01:30:09.820
Well, how do you look like a treasure troll?

01:30:09.820 --> 01:30:12.060
He had the face of a treasure troll.

01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:13.060
Same shape.

01:30:13.060 --> 01:30:14.060
And the other class called him Jolly.

01:30:14.060 --> 01:30:15.060
Jolly?

01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:16.060
No, his name was Mr. Jolly.

01:30:16.060 --> 01:30:20.060
The other classes either called him Dolly or they called him Elmer.

01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:22.060
Like Elmer Fudd.

01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:25.060
That was the one but ugly man.

01:30:25.060 --> 01:30:30.580
But I would just read comic books because I didn't care.

01:30:30.580 --> 01:30:35.240
And then there was the one time in class where, to confuse him, I asked him, can you truly

01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:40.440
square infinity because any number, the only numbers that you can multiply, you've said

01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:43.660
this yourself, it's a proven mathematical fact that the only numbers that you can square

01:30:43.660 --> 01:30:47.420
and have them equal themselves are one and zero.

01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:48.220
Right?

01:30:48.220 --> 01:30:49.140
Right.

01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:51.740
Well, you can't square infinity, because if the only two

01:30:51.740 --> 01:30:55.420
things that can equal themselves are zero and one,

01:30:55.420 --> 01:30:57.940
infinity squared cannot equal infinity.

01:30:57.940 --> 01:31:00.900
That just disproves that, though, because infinity is not

01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:01.820
even a number, though.

01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:03.780
So I guess it doesn't disprove anything.

01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:05.700
It's not a number.

01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:06.500
It's an idea.

01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:07.180
Exactly.

01:31:07.180 --> 01:31:09.300
But I was using it in mathematical terms,

01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:10.920
and he was like, oh, of course you can.

01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:25.160
I feel like I'm in school right now.

01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:28.240
Can we stop?

01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:29.240
Okay we can stop.

01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:31.520
I was a little brat.

01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:37.680
Okay then we're school.

01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:40.680
We're going to take a quick break and then we're going to come back and I think we want

01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:41.680
You are listless when we come back for the break?

01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:42.680
Sure.

01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:43.680
Okay.

01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:44.680
Tonight's listless.

01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:46.320
So, who wants to participate tonight?

01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:47.320
Okay.

01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:48.320
Oh, everybody?

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:49.320
Six?

01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:50.320
We could do it.

01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:51.320
Yeah.

01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:52.320
Okay.

01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:53.320
But this is the interesting thing.

01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:54.320
Okay, the list tonight.

01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:56.920
Top three things that Konami needs to apologize for.

01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:58.280
Okay.

01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:03.280
So think about that during the break, and we'll be back.

01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:10.280
alright

01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:51.280
Come on, shake your body, baby, do the come down, no You can't control yourself any longer

01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:10.280
Everybody makes a deal that comes out Don't you pick a choice that's in it

01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:12.280
All you're building up are the music getting stronger

01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:14.280
Don't you fight it, please, let the deal that comes out

01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:30.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:37.280
Everybody gather round now, let your body feel the heat

01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:45.280
Don't you worry if you can't dance, let the music move your feet

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:53.280
Put the bread down on the island, and like sugar cane so sweet

01:34:53.280 --> 01:35:01.860
But if you want to do the contest, you've got to listen to the beat

01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:03.680
Come you, shake your body, baby, do the combo

01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:05.560
No hit the charges, can you come along?

01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:07.600
Come on, shake your body, baby, do the combo

01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:09.620
No hit the charges, can you come along?

01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:11.460
Come you, shake your body, baby, do the gunfire

01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:13.320
No hit the charges, can you come along?

01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:17.920
Come on, shake your body, baby, do the combo

01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:51.920
We are what we're supposed to be

01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:54.920
Illusions of our capacity

01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:57.920
Out of the light you speak and face

01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:00.920
What you do is what you wish to do

01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:02.920
We are the god of symphony

01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:05.920
We do the things you want to see

01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:08.920
Bring my friends to the extreme

01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:11.920
Our friends are so unreasonable

01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:14.920
They do the unpredictable

01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:17.520
I don't like to speak and say

01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:20.720
What we do is what you wish to do

01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:23.320
That's all I know, that's my friend

01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:25.720
Going on a little bit

01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:28.520
Bring my friend to the extreme

01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:31.520
One by one, we're making it fun

01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:34.320
We are the actual heroes of the world

01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:37.120
We are the ones who've gone there forever

01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:39.320
You say bye-bye, crazy-bye

01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:42.720
Oh, the ones that'll never be forever

01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:48.220
You can fly fast, or I can hold your hand We're going to go to the party

01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:53.720
We're going to the party We're going to go to the party

01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:10.720
That's a long way to go, huh?

01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:15.720
I know, but I'm afraid I'll be going.

01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:19.720
into the dark black forest.

01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:44.920
Into the dark black forest.

01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:51.920
easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:21.360
So, you just want to duplicate something because you really believe it's true, then fine, do

01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:22.360
it.

01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:25.760
With all due respect to Konami, because of course the show wouldn't exist without DDR,

01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:27.760
but you know, there are a few things they could fix.

01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:28.760
I would find another reason.

01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:29.760
There are a few things they could fix.

01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:32.760
If it was not for Paraparaparadise.

01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:35.520
Alright, go for it, Jamie, you want to start?

01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:40.400
Oh, let me, I'm sorry, I have to bring up the list, my word document where I can actually

01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:42.280
make lists here.

01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:45.780
I noticed how I've never erased that Erotic one, because that was the greatest one we ever did.

01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:47.780
Alright, Jamie, your number three pick.

01:39:47.780 --> 01:39:51.780
They have not done any more Super Konami World games.

01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:57.780
Super Konami World, they had done two of them on the Nintendo.

01:39:57.780 --> 01:40:01.780
And you could, like, play as Boy or Girl and go to the Castlevania universe,

01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:07.280
and then go to the Gradius universe, and then it's like a bunch of Konami games in one, and it was neat.

01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:09.780
And they haven't done any since.

01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:11.780
We need more Super Konami World!

01:40:39.780 --> 01:40:46.780
One I just put basically was shitty steps for hella good songs on Xtreme.

01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:53.780
Sink steps suck, Frozen Ray sucks, V sucks.

01:40:53.780 --> 01:40:57.780
I mean, the list could just go on. Colors sucks.

01:40:57.780 --> 01:41:01.780
I mean, I'd even need to say more about that.

01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:03.780
shitty steps for good songs on Xtreme.

01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:38.780
They should have had... I think it sucked that they didn't have any Korean songs on there, because that was what made...

01:41:38.780 --> 01:41:45.780
Yeah, well, I know. That made the first, second, and third mixes fast, though, I thought.

01:41:45.780 --> 01:41:47.780
They didn't? Whoops.

01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:49.780
Maybe the first ones you played or something.

01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:56.780
Yeah. Okay. Well, I just like Korean songs. Okay, thanks.

01:41:56.780 --> 01:41:57.780
Okay, Ice Queen.

01:41:57.780 --> 01:42:00.780
I'd say they need to apologize for not making any more keyboard mania.

01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:26.300
The number three thing they should apologize for, you know I actually had DDRPC on my list,

01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:32.800
So I'm going to say the number three thing that Konami should apologize for, and I apologize

01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:35.740
in advance to some folks in our chat room because they're really going to hate me for

01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:38.840
saying this, but they need to apologize for the whistle song.

01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:41.800
Yes, that song fucking sucks.

01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:45.880
And I know there's fans of it in the chat room, but you need to understand, I had no

01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:53.360
problem with the song until other people ruined it for me by like chanting along to it and

01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:59.520
all that stuff it's now ruined and now it needs to be apologized for so all

01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:07.560
right my number two pick is they should apologize for the bad voice acting in

01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:10.920
Castlevania Symphony of the night

01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:18.160
they came had atrocious voice acting in comparison to the Japanese version it

01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:22.160
It was not by my hand that I was once again given flesh.

01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:26.160
Die, monster! You don't belong in this world!

01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:31.160
Oh yeah? Well die, Richter voice actor! You don't belong in this game! Ha ha!

01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:34.160
Alright. Loki, your number two pick.

01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:40.160
Um, let's see. I would have to say they need to apologize.

01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:45.160
This should almost be a number one, but they need to apologize for B4U.

01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:53.160
I hate the group. I hate the group B4U that can all die, okay? All of them.

01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:57.160
Jamie had that written as her number one, now she's thinking.

01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:01.160
All right.

01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:03.160
Your number two pick, zero.

01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:06.160
Um, basically fucking over the U.S.

01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:10.160
When it comes to any DDR releases, or pretty much any Beemani releases,

01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:13.160
we get, like, the total shit end of the stick.

01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:20.160
The Japanese one was good but the US one was totally just raped.

01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:50.160
They know they have the following here now, so why don't they do something about it instead of keep screwing us over?

01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:52.160
Okay.

01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:55.160
Oh, I guess it's my turn. Okay.

01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:57.160
Let's see, where am I here?

01:44:57.160 --> 01:45:07.160
Oh, I think we should apologize for not making more mixes of Para Para Paradise arcade game.

01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:14.000
I mean, I know Para Para Para itself kind of died in Japan, but shoot, you know, it's

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000
one game, huh?

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Yeah.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Was it?

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Really?

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Is it getting big here?

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:25.240
The Para Para craze is actually starting to pick up here a few places, like about places.

01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:27.760
Like in the dance clubs kind of thing?

01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:31.680
Well, they've had Para Para All Stars Touring in the US.

01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:32.680
You're kidding me.

01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:37.680
At the Anime Expo, they had them giving out flyers and doing instructions at Anime Expo last year.

01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:40.680
That's fly! Awesome.

01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:44.680
Don't go to Anime Expo, by the way, because it's the worst convention ever.

01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:47.680
So, yeah.

01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:50.680
Well, more Para-Para, please.

01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:53.680
Anyway, I'll pass the microphone.

01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:54.680
Yes.

01:45:54.680 --> 01:46:02.680
Okay, Konami really needs to apologize, and this is kind of an addition to Zero's earlier statement.

01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:06.680
Just, they need to apologize for Konami USA, period.

01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:10.680
I'm just, I'm elaborating on his, that was my original idea.

01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:16.680
Konami America is just, I'm sorry, it is just not limited to Konami.

01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:22.680
Everything they made in Japan that has been transferred over to the US through Konami USA

01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:28.680
Sucks! They raped it up the ass and started punching it. What is that, donkey punching?

01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:35.680
Yeah. I'm like, I'm sorry, but that's just it. Period. Next.

01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:47.680
Alright, my number two pick that Konami needs to apologize for. I would say Castlevania 64.

01:46:47.680 --> 01:47:02.680
When I first started playing that game, I thought it almost started off as a good game and then like halfway through the first level I was like ehh.

01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:15.680
They need to apologize for the Super Nintendo version of Dracula X because I have the PC Engine version.

01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:37.680
And you know what? Where I actually really like the Super Nintendo one, if ever you've played the PC Engine version, then that's like, where the PC Engine version is like eating a feast, the SNES version is like vomit. So, yeah.

01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:40.680
So Dracula V gets a...

01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:41.680
Five!

01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:43.680
Isn't that what they called it here?

01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:44.680
No, it was Dracula X on the Super Nintendo.

01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:48.680
I thought they called it Dracula V. Or Castlevania V or something.

01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:49.680
No, it's Dracula X.

01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:50.680
Oh, okay. My bad. My bad.

01:47:50.680 --> 01:47:54.680
So it's actually cool because, you know, actually Symphony of the Night was Dracula X2.

01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:56.680
All right.

01:47:56.680 --> 01:48:00.680
So you're Loki. I'm sorry. Loki's number one pick.

01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:03.680
Okay.

01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:07.680
Um, they need to apologize.

01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:10.680
Propolitary.

01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:29.680
Because, uh, you know what, she wouldn't have a career if it weren't for DDR, and I would hope that she wouldn't have a career if it weren't for DDR, and, you know, I wish she would just go, you know what, uh, yeah, we were hoping that you would get better, you never did, so bye.

01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:32.680
Zero, your number one pick?

01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:01.680
All right.

01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:03.680
Anita.

01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:06.680
I have a question, Zero. How come you named your cat, Naoki, then?

01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:08.680
Ha ha ha! Touché!

01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:13.680
Because I was actually drunk when I named my cat.

01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:16.680
And I just got too lazy trying to think of something else.

01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:19.680
And my cat makes the name Naoki sound cool.

01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:23.680
Well, your cat was also answering to Nao-chan, too.

01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:28.760
Anita, you're number one.

01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:31.880
Okay, my number one. They should apologize for

01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:36.200
let them move!

01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:40.440
Excellent suggestion.

01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:44.040
Matt, or Ice Queen, your number one pick. They need to apologize.

01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:47.240
Oh yes, yes.

01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:52.640
Is that your answer or what do you want to say? You know what, I had something in mind, but I'm going to change it to Loki's.

01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:55.640
Bag. Period.

01:49:55.640 --> 01:50:00.640
Who wants to hear a freakin' bagpipe screeching as loud as you can get it?

01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:05.640
Oh my god, Jamie. Oh my god. No comment.

01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:08.640
They really need to apologize for that.

01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:13.640
Okay, very controversial topic in the chat where we have a lot of people arguing with this. This is interesting.

01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:17.640
Alright, but my number one, and I'm surprised nobody's said this yet,

01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:47.600
No New Super Konami World Games, DDRPC, Shitty Steps for Good Songs on Extreme, Not Making DDR USA Arcade Better, Discontinuing Keyboard Mania, The Whistle Song, Bad Voice Act 2 in Castlevania 2 The Night,

01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:52.600
fucking over the U.S. No new Parpar games, konami USA,

01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:56.600
Castlevania 64, SNES version of Dracula X,

01:50:56.600 --> 01:51:01.600
Politary, Naoki and his 150 aliases. Let them move, bag, and new logo.

01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:07.600
Probably Naoki.

01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:15.600
Because before I had heard many tac things, I really liked Naoki's mixes.

01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:22.600
Remember, I was a big fan of Brilliant To You O.D. That was my favorite song ever.

01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:27.040
I would agree to some extent because some of the Naoki aliases are bad, like Naoki

01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:34.040
featuring Politary and Naoki NMR, like Let Them Move and stuff, those are bad, but Naoki

01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:39.080
Underground who did Insertion, that's pretty cool. Although I do agree he needs to get

01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:46.880
over the identity crisis okay uh next yeah loki what are you taking off um i'm gonna

01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:51.600
take off not making ddr usa arcade better because you know what i just don't care if

01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:54.760
that machine doesn't exist to me anymore so whatever

01:51:54.760 --> 01:52:02.200
you know the other i almost took off that one but for one reason it sort of opened the

01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:08.200
door for all the new stuff we're getting now, so, yeah.

01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:14.800
It's red and has Konami on it. It's okay. Okay. Zero, what's coming off the list?

01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:19.800
Even though I totally agree, I would say let them move. Take that off. Even though I, I

01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:24.800
mean, I absolutely agree with it because it's horrible, but the other ones are better.

01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:28.800
The song sucks.

01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:32.800
Anita.

01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:34.800
Uh...

01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:37.800
Jeez. Where does the list begin?

01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:39.800
I'm sorry. It starts with...

01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:41.800
Ladies Night to Get Out was from a couple weeks ago.

01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:43.800
It starts here. There we go.

01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:45.800
Okay. Um...

01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:48.800
Ah, gosh.

01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:52.800
Alright, I'll just say shitty steps for a good song sitting straight.

01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:54.800
Okay.

01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:59.800
Yes, exactly. That is the reason I am attacking Zero.

01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:09.800
I don't know, I just think you have a very good point, but it just doesn't seem like as much of a bitch as the rest of the stuff.

01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:12.800
Alright.

01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:15.800
Decision's final. Matt, what comes off the list?

01:53:15.800 --> 01:53:20.800
I'll have to take off the new logo just because, you know, there's so many other things on there that are so much better.

01:53:20.800 --> 01:53:24.800
It sucks, but it's lesser of evil.

01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:30.800
I'm going to get slapped for this, but it's so bad that it's good.

01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:33.800
I'm taking off the bad voice acting in Castlevania 6 days at night.

01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:35.800
No!

01:53:35.800 --> 01:53:41.800
Because, you know what, it's one of those things where it's like, I love mimicking it.

01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:44.800
Die, monster! You don't belong in this world!

01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:48.800
And I mean, it's so bad that I love to mimic it, so for that it's redeemable.

01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:55.800
and it said true of all religions. Dan and I used to quote that game.

01:53:56.800 --> 01:54:00.880
And I'm not doing that because Brad is jumping in the chatroom up and down asking me to,

01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:07.880
but I really do think that it's so bad it's good, so there you go.

01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:15.720
Alright, so I have to close out all the windows first before I can start taking votes here.

01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:20.720
Somebody had suggested, because of no new remixes by the T-word...

01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:23.720
What were some of the suggestions? I missed them. Oh well.

01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:28.720
I find it funny that he's been reduced to a four-letter word.

01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:31.720
Alright. We're going to post that list and you guys can send in your...

01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:32.720

Don't wanna play a game

01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:12.040
I apologize because that was mislabeled, so that wasn't the old school one, but I found

01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:17.080
labeled so that wasn't the old-school one but I found the right one so enjoy a double shot

01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:45.040
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:52.040

Ah!

01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:02.040
Ah!

01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:03.040
Ah!

01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:18.040
Get up, stand up, stretch up on your suction bowl

01:59:18.040 --> 01:59:22.040
How you gonna be the attraction?

01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:26.040
And why don't you, if you wanna stay to the wall

01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:29.040
Ride yourself a piece of reaction

01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:32.040
Got you, get out, let's make big fails

01:59:32.040 --> 01:59:34.040
Get up, you know when you got to go

01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:36.040
Get up, get up, dancing all the time, come on

01:59:36.040 --> 01:59:37.040
Here we go, here we go

01:59:37.040 --> 01:59:39.040
Get up, stand up

01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:41.040
Stretch your body, stretch your neck

01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:43.040
Get up, stand up

01:59:44.040 --> 01:59:47.040
Let's just use it there in a corner

01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:51.040
Sitting by yourself in the top

01:59:51.040 --> 01:59:54.040
You don't really wanna be no, no, no

01:59:54.040 --> 01:59:56.040
Come on now, get up and dance, dance, dance, dance

01:59:56.040 --> 01:59:58.040
Dance, dance, dance, come on, get your feet

01:59:58.040 --> 02:00:00.040
Wreck my feet, you the most it's gon' be

02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:16.040
Get up, stand up, touch up from the shoulder

02:00:18.040 --> 02:00:26.040
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF. Looking for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.

02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:32.540
But hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great?

02:00:32.540 --> 02:00:35.060
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

02:00:35.060 --> 02:00:41.260
Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

02:00:41.260 --> 02:00:45.260
Howdy, kids! We're back, and we're being a little slow

02:00:45.260 --> 02:00:50.900
because the listless votes aren't fully tallied yet, so we're going to go right into this week's cage match.

02:00:50.900 --> 02:00:55.840
Uh, last week... oh, I've got to get all this stuff cued up, though. I'm not even ready.

02:00:55.840 --> 02:00:57.460
Is there anything, uh...

02:00:57.460 --> 02:01:00.660
Wait, wait, wait, but you said you wanted to make a stipulation before this week's cage...

02:01:00.660 --> 02:01:03.660
Are you pulling out about what you wanted to do in your song last week?

02:01:03.660 --> 02:01:07.660
If I withdrew mine, I'd want to put in a new one, which means I have to go to my car real quick.

02:01:07.660 --> 02:01:09.660
Oh, so you have last week's winner in here.

02:01:09.660 --> 02:01:13.660
I put it in there, but I kind of want to withdraw it and put in something new if I can.

02:01:13.660 --> 02:01:16.660
What do you guys think? Well, let's ask the chat room what they think.

02:01:16.660 --> 02:01:19.660
Let's hear a little bit of last week's winner.

02:01:19.660 --> 02:01:20.660
Because Jamie's having second thoughts.

02:01:20.660 --> 02:01:22.660
I hated it. Okay.

02:01:22.660 --> 02:01:23.660
Jamie doesn't really like that song.

02:01:23.660 --> 02:01:25.660
I picked it because it was hyper.

02:01:25.660 --> 02:01:26.660
Okay, then we're going to play a little clip of it.

02:01:26.660 --> 02:01:30.720
This is Link's theme, the Heave Dance Remix.

02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:35.580
And if the chat room says it's okay to bend the rules a little bit this week and let Jamie

02:01:35.580 --> 02:01:39.820
take it out and give us something new, then we'll do it.

02:01:39.820 --> 02:01:46.820
so here we go

02:02:09.820 --> 02:02:16.820
Alright, by an overwhelming vote in the chat room, it's out of here. It's gone.

02:02:16.820 --> 02:02:19.820
Alright, I'm going to go get a CD out of the car. I'll be right back.

02:02:19.820 --> 02:02:25.820
Alright, so I'm getting suggestions for what to put in this week, too. That's great.

02:02:25.820 --> 02:02:31.820
Okay, so we're going to start this week's cage match, except I'm short a few songs.

02:02:31.820 --> 02:02:37.820
So, Clean Slate. We have no winners coming over from last week because we're deleting that because it sucked.

02:02:37.820 --> 02:02:45.820
I don't know how it won. I guess the other two songs. I put in Fable, and everybody has something against that song.

02:02:45.820 --> 02:02:54.820
Alright, so I guess I'll start. This is the way, since we're starting with a clean slate tonight, let's refresh everybody on how the cage match works.

02:02:54.820 --> 02:03:06.820
We have this little segment that reoccurs on the show called the Orange Lounge Cage Match. The way it works, each of the hosts puts in one song that they want to put in there.

02:03:06.820 --> 02:03:10.820
And the chat room votes on which is their favorite.

02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:16.820
And the winner gets to go into regular rotation on the station during the Bamani Music & More program.

02:03:16.820 --> 02:03:23.820
So, I'm getting votes for stuff. This is interesting. Oh no. Don't tell me what to put in.

02:03:25.820 --> 02:03:29.820
And like half the ones you're mentioning either suck ass or have already been in there.

02:03:30.820 --> 02:03:34.820
No, actually another song by that artist is in there. I get what she was saying.

02:03:34.820 --> 02:03:38.180
I already have I already have a song for this week, but I'll do that for next week. Oh

02:03:39.140 --> 02:03:44.020
I'm so tempted to put that song in just J or whatever you're called this week, Justin

02:03:44.020 --> 02:03:48.580
I really want to put that first song in there you sent me, but I'm not ready to yet

02:03:48.580 --> 02:03:51.900
We'll do that next week. Okay, because I really want to do this song this week. So I'll start

02:03:52.500 --> 02:03:59.180
My song this week that I'm going to do is by a group that you know from 2dx

02:03:59.180 --> 02:04:02.680
They were in seventh style and they have a pretty popular song in there

02:04:02.680 --> 02:04:08.040
the song they did in there was called the beauty of silence and the group is

02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:13.880
svenson and guilin and this this is another song by them i have this song

02:04:13.880 --> 02:04:17.480
well cool this is uh my pick for tonight's cage match this is a song

02:04:17.480 --> 02:04:20.600
called twisted by the same group that did beauty of silence svenson and

02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:27.600
leland enjoyed

02:06:20.600 --> 02:06:43.240
that kind of has an abrupt ending oops that's because it came off a non-stop mix that was

02:06:43.240 --> 02:06:47.200
the actually that was the energy mix of Twisted by Svensson and Geedle in the same group the

02:06:47.200 --> 02:06:49.200
beauty of silence and what y'all think

02:06:49.200 --> 02:06:51.200
beauty of silence it ain't

02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:53.200
sorry that was really boring

02:06:53.200 --> 02:06:55.200
what do you give it on 110?

02:06:55.200 --> 02:06:57.200
well poop on you

02:06:57.200 --> 02:06:59.200
i give it a 5

02:06:59.200 --> 02:07:01.200
right down the middle

02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:03.200
zero

02:07:03.200 --> 02:07:05.200
i kind of give it

02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:07.200
i have to mix it up

02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:09.200
i guess i give it a 6

02:07:09.200 --> 02:07:11.200
because i really like beauty of silence

02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:13.200
and that seemed to have been really well

02:07:13.200 --> 02:07:15.200
more real repetitive

02:07:15.200 --> 02:07:20.200
I've heard better cuts of that same song, and that was a pretty bad cut of it.

02:07:20.200 --> 02:07:29.200
Like you said, it's repetitive, and it does kind of, you know, do something ill with the middle, because in the beginning, it might make you feel bad, but it's not good for the core.

02:07:29.200 --> 02:07:31.200
On all of you.

02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:32.200
You're really not gonna like it.

02:07:32.200 --> 02:07:33.200
Ice clean.

02:07:33.200 --> 02:07:34.200
Yeah.

02:07:35.200 --> 02:07:42.200
I don't like repetitive notes, and that was all that was, and I've never heard any other version of that, so that's all I have to go on. I have to give it a three.

02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:50.200
I can't really do too much of a judgment as far as cast history on this one goes.

02:07:50.200 --> 02:07:52.200
I feel like this one's gonna be with stylists.

02:07:52.200 --> 02:08:00.200
But this one was like, well I'm just going by an overall judgment and I have to give it about a 5 because it was kind of repetitive.

02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:03.200
But I kind of liked it too.

02:08:03.200 --> 02:08:05.200
It just sounded kind of nice.

02:08:05.200 --> 02:08:10.200
Alright, and personally I give that a 150 so that way it averages all your votes to a 10.

02:08:10.200 --> 02:08:11.200
Yeah, that's great.

02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:46.160
you saw next week that if you will see i'm gonna come back i'm gonna save this clip of the show

02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:51.040
and after i play what he sent me next week i'm gonna remind you all that you asked me to play

02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:59.120
that okay that's all i have to say all right come on and all your balls need to yeah i don't have

02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:01.500
All right, Jamie, what's your pick tell us about it?

02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:32.620
of people calling my eyes

02:09:32.620 --> 02:09:35.620
they're praying to shake it down

02:09:35.620 --> 02:09:39.620
saying, oh, dear, dear

02:09:39.620 --> 02:09:43.620
they're really saying, I'm

02:09:46.620 --> 02:09:47.120
hi

02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:49.620
I don't know what happened

02:09:49.620 --> 02:09:51.620
I don't know what happened, let me have a sip, sorry.

02:10:08.620 --> 02:10:13.620
Okay, I'm going to abort this real fast because we're going to try switching it around a little bit.

02:10:13.620 --> 02:10:14.620
We're having issues with that CD.

02:10:14.620 --> 02:10:16.620
I burned this like three days ago.

02:10:16.620 --> 02:10:18.620
Let's see, I'm going to put it in the other drive and see what happens.

02:10:18.620 --> 02:10:22.620
It's a pretty big scratch right there.

02:10:22.620 --> 02:10:26.620
Yeah, it's a pretty big scratch right in the middle.

02:10:26.620 --> 02:10:30.620
Well, let's try it.

02:10:30.620 --> 02:10:34.620
Okay, we're going to restart this.

02:10:34.620 --> 02:10:38.620
This is the burner.

02:10:38.620 --> 02:10:42.620
Sorry about that.

02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:46.620
I don't have the three of that with me.

02:10:46.620 --> 02:10:48.620
Thank you everybody.

02:11:16.620 --> 02:11:18.620
Oh

02:11:46.620 --> 02:11:47.620
Now what?

02:12:17.620 --> 02:12:43.620
I see trees of green, red-rooted tombs I see them bloom, poor me and you

02:12:43.620 --> 02:12:54.620
And I think to myself what a wonderful world

02:12:56.620 --> 02:13:01.620
I wanna see the skies of blue

02:13:01.620 --> 02:13:04.620
And clouds of white

02:13:04.620 --> 02:13:07.620
The brightest light of day

02:13:07.620 --> 02:13:11.620
The dark state of night

02:13:11.620 --> 02:13:14.620
I've got things in my hand

02:13:16.620 --> 02:13:20.620
What a wonderful way

02:13:20.620 --> 02:13:27.620
What a wonderful land

02:13:27.620 --> 02:13:53.620
What a wonderful land

02:14:53.620 --> 02:14:56.620
I'm also a little lazy

02:14:56.620 --> 02:14:59.620
Of people going by

02:14:59.620 --> 02:15:03.620
I can feel shaking hands

02:15:03.620 --> 02:15:07.620
Staying for the reason

02:15:07.620 --> 02:15:10.620
That everything is being

02:15:10.620 --> 02:15:14.620
All I love is

02:15:14.620 --> 02:15:18.620
I hear a baby cry

02:15:18.620 --> 02:15:21.620
One second cry

02:15:21.620 --> 02:15:27.620
There ain't much more that I ever know

02:15:28.620 --> 02:15:30.620
The things in my head

02:15:32.620 --> 02:15:38.620
They're a wonderful world

02:15:38.620 --> 02:15:45.620
But I don't want you to go away

02:16:08.620 --> 02:16:18.620
kostjamrh Alrighty, that was Beatbox from The What A Wonderful World.

02:16:18.620 --> 02:16:25.620
Alrighty, tell us what you thought, give it a scale of 110. Jamie?

02:16:25.620 --> 02:16:32.620
Oh wait, oops, I have the volume way up too loud. Sorry about that. Jamie, tell us again. Sorry, I had the volume way too loud on that. Tell us what's out of that.

02:16:32.620 --> 02:16:33.620
Twenty-four.

02:16:33.620 --> 02:16:34.620
Okay.

02:16:34.620 --> 02:16:48.620
Um... I didn't like it very much. I... It was... I'm sorry, I don't like club mixes of, like, songs like that. It's just... it just doesn't fit.

02:16:48.620 --> 02:16:53.620
Everyone thinks that the formula for a dance song is let's put a beat to it and add lyrics from an old song.

02:16:53.620 --> 02:16:54.620
No, it's not gonna work.

02:16:54.620 --> 02:16:56.620
So, um...

02:16:56.620 --> 02:17:01.620
And then that part in the end where it starts kinda doing this little thing where it starts changing the pitch a little bit,

02:17:01.620 --> 02:17:05.620
where it starts getting way out of key and then coming back in, I don't know what the hell that was either.

02:17:05.620 --> 02:17:07.620
So I go to six.

02:17:07.620 --> 02:17:09.620
Better than the other song, but still.

02:17:09.620 --> 02:17:11.620
Alright, zero.

02:17:11.620 --> 02:17:14.620
Generally, I don't really care what it is.

02:17:14.620 --> 02:17:21.620
I personally liked that song. I liked the variety, I liked how it wasn't the same goddamn beat the whole way through.

02:17:44.620 --> 02:17:47.620
So they'd be faded out, in a faded bag, different kind.

02:17:47.620 --> 02:17:52.620
And yes, I like this one too, the original, so I'm going to have to give that one a 10.

02:17:52.620 --> 02:17:54.620
Just because that's a happy song.

02:17:54.620 --> 02:17:57.620
This one's a happy song. Very, very happy, happy.

02:17:57.620 --> 02:18:03.620
I liked it. I wasn't too crazy about how the rhythm kind of reminded me of Beauty and Silence

02:18:03.620 --> 02:18:05.620
and there's a little hint to that.

02:18:05.620 --> 02:18:11.620
But overall, it's a very nice sounding song, a little on the long side, but not too bad.

02:18:11.620 --> 02:18:14.620
I'll give it an 8. It's nice.

02:18:32.620 --> 02:18:35.620
That song makes my heart happy whenever I'm in a rotten room.

02:18:35.620 --> 02:18:38.620
That's one of the few songs that just makes me happy all over.

02:19:05.620 --> 02:19:15.620
Night Angel Mix, it's Loki vs. Steve Reiner, featuring a Solaris or something like that.

02:19:15.620 --> 02:19:17.620
Okay, here you go

02:20:15.620 --> 02:20:43.620
It's a long way to go, honey It's a long way to go, honey

02:20:43.620 --> 02:20:45.620
It's a long way to go, honey.

02:20:46.620 --> 02:20:50.620
I know. But I'm awake. How are we going?

02:20:50.620 --> 02:20:54.620
Into the dark, black forest.

02:21:50.620 --> 02:22:16.060
Okay, what did y'all think of that one?

02:22:16.060 --> 02:22:21.060
How is Steve Rider vs Loki featuring Solaris with Dark Black Forest?

02:22:21.060 --> 02:22:26.060
Keep in mind that I'm trying to bypass my bias against Dark Black Forest.

02:22:26.060 --> 02:22:29.060
Because I'm utterly sick and disgusted with that song.

02:22:29.060 --> 02:22:32.060
However, it was nicely done.

02:22:32.060 --> 02:22:36.060
So I'm trying to bypass my bias with that song.

02:22:36.060 --> 02:22:42.060
I give it a seven, plain, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, eight, eight.

02:22:42.060 --> 02:22:45.060
Okay.

02:22:45.060 --> 02:22:47.060
Loki?

02:22:47.060 --> 02:22:51.060
As mentioned in the chatroom, it doesn't sound very remixed.

02:22:51.060 --> 02:22:58.060
There's actually a lot of subtle stuff, and there's a few more synth things added to the actual main synth of the song.

02:22:58.060 --> 02:23:01.060
So it's kind of hard to detect that there.

02:23:01.060 --> 02:23:08.060
It was a mix between one song by Sinaris, I don't remember exactly what the song was called,

02:23:08.060 --> 02:23:18.060
And uh, Dark Black Forest, uh, long trip, so there's a lot of stuff that sounds the same, but you know, overall it is really mixed, not just like, oh, here's Dark Black Forest, I'm just going through that.

02:23:18.060 --> 02:23:25.060
But um, I give it an 8 because the Legend of Trance is way better, but you know, I'm getting better, working on it.

02:23:25.060 --> 02:23:27.060
Alright, Zero?

02:23:27.060 --> 02:23:34.060
I don't know how many more trips to the dark black forest we need to take, but it was pretty good.

02:23:34.060 --> 02:23:38.060
And look, he's right, there's a lot of slow stuff, so for you people who didn't hear it, turn your

02:23:38.060 --> 02:23:42.060
stereos or headphones up really really loud and you'll be able to hear it.

02:23:42.060 --> 02:23:46.060
But I guess I'll give it an 8 because I still did enjoy it.

02:23:49.060 --> 02:23:55.060
I have to agree with the last two clips, I give it an 8 just because I liked it.

02:23:55.060 --> 02:24:05.060
The beginning was kind of a little bit slow, but it was very repetitive.

02:24:05.060 --> 02:24:08.060
But then it picked up and I liked it again.

02:24:08.060 --> 02:24:13.060
I think I'll give it an 8, because I...

02:24:13.060 --> 02:24:19.060
Oh, wait a minute. I'm thinking backwards. I'm giving it a 7, because...

02:24:19.060 --> 02:24:32.060
The previous song, I thought that was a bit better. I like that one. This one is good, but it does sound a little bit like the original, so I like the first or second entry the best.

02:24:49.060 --> 02:24:53.060
It was just Dark Black Forest's long trip with some subtle synth.

02:24:53.060 --> 02:24:57.060
The next one is going to be totally different than the trance remixes I've been doing.

02:24:57.060 --> 02:25:01.060
It's going to be an even more hardcore version of Sligo Works.

02:25:01.060 --> 02:25:03.060
You're going to love it.

02:25:03.060 --> 02:25:04.060
Okay, let's recap.

02:25:04.060 --> 02:25:06.060
I'm getting happy thinking about that.

02:25:06.060 --> 02:25:07.060
Quick recap, here we go.

02:25:07.060 --> 02:25:08.060
These are the three things you can vote for.

02:25:08.060 --> 02:25:11.060
You can send your votes now over private messages to Sky in the chat room.

02:25:11.060 --> 02:25:13.060
First one you can vote for,

02:25:13.060 --> 02:25:28.780
Second one you can vote for, Beatbox, right, is that Beatbox?

02:25:28.780 --> 02:25:33.300
Beatbox with What a Wonderful World is the other one you can vote for.

02:25:33.300 --> 02:25:34.300
CD Fire's out.

02:25:34.300 --> 02:25:56.160
All right, and the third song you can vote for, Steve Reiner vs. Loki featuring Solaris

02:25:56.160 --> 02:26:15.760
Cenaris with Dark Black Forest.

02:26:15.760 --> 02:26:21.680
Alright, again, first song was Svensson and Gleelan with Twisted, second song was Beatbox

02:26:21.680 --> 02:26:26.040
with A Wonderful World, third song was Steve Reiner vs Loki featuring Cenaris with What

02:26:26.040 --> 02:26:30.040
I just thought of my next week's song. Damn it, that sucks.

02:26:30.040 --> 02:26:32.040
Oh, you just thought of the song you really wanted to do?

02:26:32.040 --> 02:26:35.040
I just thought it was in my car, too. It was like, ehh, next week.

02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:39.040
Alright. So, there you go. Send your votes in now to Sky.

02:26:39.040 --> 02:26:42.040
In the meantime, we don't want to go right to a break, because we just played a bunch of music.

02:26:42.040 --> 02:26:46.040
So, let's try to chat it up a little bit, shall we?

02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:49.040
Who has something they want to talk about?

02:26:49.040 --> 02:26:50.040
Loki.

02:26:50.040 --> 02:26:54.040
Well, let's see. Uh, Jackie? Wait.

02:26:54.040 --> 02:27:00.800
I haven't made a racial comment this week yet. Oh dear god. Okay, good, because I'm

02:27:00.800 --> 02:27:05.680
not going to. I'm not going to, but I was just thinking back to when we were talking

02:27:05.680 --> 02:27:16.280
over food at TJ Friday's about my blank owner's club game where you have to train your people

02:27:16.280 --> 02:27:28.520
I still like mocap bakery.

02:27:28.520 --> 02:27:34.520
And then what was yours, mocap hansel and gretel, where you shove the little children

02:27:34.520 --> 02:27:36.520
into an oven?

02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:46.440
Well, let's see, big news, this week opening up was Dreamcatcher, and for all the, yeah,

02:27:46.440 --> 02:27:50.800
yeah, I agree Dreamcatcher looked like ass, but you know what was before it? It was the

02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:56.680
Final Play of Osiris, and that kicks ass. I would go see it just for that.

02:27:56.680 --> 02:28:05.680
I would pay matinee prices just to go see that, that, and I'd just walk out of the movie.

02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:20.560
Q. Ever since Puppy introduced me to BitTorrent, I've been loving downloading things for free,

02:28:20.560 --> 02:28:21.560
like movies.

02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:26.880
And I downloaded that movie Foam Booth, which Brad and I were telling me that it was actually

02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:38.820
just a rip-off of an old movie with Wesley Snipes in it. I was getting that and what

02:28:38.820 --> 02:28:43.960
sucked is I left it on for about 18 hours to get the goddamn movie and then it wouldn't

02:28:43.960 --> 02:28:48.440
even burn because it told me I had the wrong type of burner to do it. I'm so mad. I'm gonna

02:28:48.440 --> 02:28:51.900
just burn off those files and take it to someone else's house. But I'm like, how cool. I can

02:28:51.900 --> 02:28:55.840
have like a movie like two weeks before it's out in the theater and then I was

02:28:55.840 --> 02:29:02.960
getting phone booth it's um this new program it's called bit torrent and if

02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:08.560
black lab has a link to that site he gave me that would be cool it's this

02:29:08.560 --> 02:29:13.800
it's I I would say it's like win MX or something like that but it's not it's a

02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:17.760
little different because it's not a separate client it's a download tool you

02:29:17.760 --> 02:29:25.700
install into your browser, so when you start downloading a file with a.torrent extension,

02:29:25.700 --> 02:29:30.160
what you do is you start downloading this file from, I guess, I don't know, it tells

02:29:30.160 --> 02:29:35.040
you where everybody else has the file, and you start downloading from people, and then

02:29:35.040 --> 02:29:38.080
as you're downloading it, when new people start downloading, they start downloading

02:29:38.080 --> 02:29:42.640
from you. So the key is to make it work, you have to leave your thing on for like a couple

02:29:42.640 --> 02:29:46.200
hours after you finish so other people can finish their stuff too. But it's a way of

02:29:46.200 --> 02:29:50.720
just basically file distribution. It's mass leeching and seeding and all that. But it's

02:29:50.720 --> 02:30:02.000
cool. How I've used it so far, I've gotten like a couple CDs in a movie, and I'm working

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:05.160
on getting Final Fantasy Origins, but it's not finished yet. And I had to stop it because

02:30:05.160 --> 02:30:13.080
we had to start the show. The Final Fantasy I and II for America? Yep. That'll be fun.

02:30:13.080 --> 02:30:17.080
Okay, so what else is on y'all's minds? How was your week? How was your week, Anita?

02:30:17.080 --> 02:30:24.080
My week was pretty good. On Saturday, we went out to the store, did a little browsing at a game shop.

02:30:24.080 --> 02:30:27.080
I bought.hack, the new PlayStation 2 game.

02:30:27.080 --> 02:30:28.080
And how's that? How'd you like it?

02:30:28.080 --> 02:30:32.080
I haven't started yet, but it looks really, really cool. I just got it.

02:30:32.080 --> 02:30:38.080
But if anybody out there has any advice or any experience playing.hack,

02:30:38.080 --> 02:30:48.080
Well, actually, I think Ice Princess has many good comments on the series, right? No? Yeah,.hack? No?

02:30:48.080 --> 02:30:51.080
Who was that? Some people are saying that this series was great.

02:30:51.080 --> 02:30:52.080
I don't remember.

02:30:52.080 --> 02:30:53.080
Loki.

02:30:53.080 --> 02:31:03.080
I heard it was good. I've never seen it. Actually, to be honest, to be honest, looking at the game from the screenshots I've seen, it looks like ass, but, you know, I don't know.

02:31:03.080 --> 02:31:06.080
It's good enough to spawn two more sequels.

02:31:06.080 --> 02:31:08.080
Whoopity-doo!

02:31:36.080 --> 02:31:41.560
I'm sure the summoner did have one good thing about it and that was that

02:31:41.560 --> 02:31:46.040
previous thing that they did based on the attention to dragons thing got any

02:31:46.040 --> 02:31:52.340
dr. pepper no Mountain Dew got any Mountain Dew like yeah it's in the

02:31:52.340 --> 02:31:59.900
fridge am I in the tavern yet no why cuz if there's any hot chicks there I want

02:31:59.900 --> 02:32:01.900
You have to do them!

02:32:29.900 --> 02:32:45.900
of their original tension, but it's a lot more realistic, and the cutscenes when you stealthily kill somebody is awesome. Their heads just pop right off. You jab them and you can kick cats and dogs. All kinds of stuff. It's actually pretty good.

02:32:59.900 --> 02:33:04.740
somebody get cut in the throat and you see like ten gallons of blood squirt out.

02:33:04.740 --> 02:33:09.900
The bloodshed is the whole point of that game. The bloodshed is the point of that game as

02:33:09.900 --> 02:33:15.620
to Resident Evil or anything else. It's just really really cool. It's like asking why anime

02:33:15.620 --> 02:33:20.620
chicks have such big breasts. They just do. That is the point.

02:33:20.620 --> 02:33:31.020
Why does Saga Frontier suck? Let's see here. Not only do you get 1 shitty quest, but no,

02:33:31.020 --> 02:33:36.060
you get 12 shitty quests that you get to go on there almost exactly the same. Plus, the

02:33:36.060 --> 02:33:39.220
graphics sucked ass, and the game was just boring as hell.

02:33:39.220 --> 02:33:40.220
And the title's crappy.

02:33:40.220 --> 02:33:42.860
The end. I ended up buying it, playing it for a week, and selling it back.

02:33:42.860 --> 02:33:46.580
And for the record, graphics do not equal gameplay.

02:33:46.580 --> 02:33:53.580
But the gameplay wasn't anything good either, so I was like, well, maybe the graphics...no, no, sorry.

02:33:53.580 --> 02:34:02.580
I'm serious, if they had a role-playing game that was like just the regular text scrolling ones that were from way back in the day, I can enjoy those more if they had a good story.

02:34:02.580 --> 02:34:08.580
No, what was freaking awesome is they're making this new side-scrolling game that's just like Contra, but you get to make your own levels.

02:34:08.580 --> 02:34:09.580
Oh, that's cool.

02:34:09.580 --> 02:34:10.580
It's got a level editor in it.

02:34:10.580 --> 02:34:14.580
That's cool. Now, I've been hearing that Unlimited Saga's supposed to be pretty redeeming.

02:34:14.580 --> 02:34:17.580
Yeah, see, well, it has about time.

02:34:17.580 --> 02:34:20.580
Because it's technically in the series.

02:34:20.580 --> 02:34:24.580
They've got like all sorts of neat limited box sets and blah blah blah.

02:34:26.580 --> 02:34:31.580
Yes, we're going to come back after a quick break with the results for both list lists, because we never did those.

02:34:31.580 --> 02:34:35.580
And the cage match, so it's going to be a whole results set when we come back from break.

02:34:35.580 --> 02:34:39.580
But first, Chat Room would like to request no Saga Frontier bashing.

02:34:41.580 --> 02:34:43.580
It sucks ass.

02:34:43.580 --> 02:34:49.580
In fact, Square should denounce, you know, Soccer Patiers being part of their, you know, whole lineup.

02:34:49.580 --> 02:34:56.580
You know what game that Square needs to denounce? Is, uh, freakin', um, uh, Legend of Mana, not, not...

02:34:56.580 --> 02:35:00.580
No, not Secret of Mana, Legend of Mana. That game was shit.

02:35:00.580 --> 02:35:06.580
Okay, I was thinking, I went ahead and got the import of that because I was like, oh, you know, it's Legend of Mana, what the hell?

02:35:06.580 --> 02:35:11.580
You know, I was thinking it was, you know, more Seiken than Sezu. But that was ass.

02:35:11.580 --> 02:35:16.580
I was about to think that you were about to say the Secret of Mana, and I would have bit-stopped you in a TomorrowCade.

02:35:16.580 --> 02:35:23.580
No, dude, I have my copy, okay, with my character named after me, although I hate to really like the blonde girl, but...

02:35:23.580 --> 02:35:25.580
Okay, so I don't have to bit-stop you.

02:35:25.580 --> 02:35:32.580
And then I have Senka Densetsu, but I need to re-get the ROM for Senka Densetsu 3, the one that's fully translated down to the graphics.

02:35:32.580 --> 02:35:37.580
Very nice. Or just, you know, borrow my friend's cartridge for Super Nintendo.

02:35:37.580 --> 02:35:43.500
I bashed soccer frontier in my sleep that it was a horrible game and anyone who likes

02:35:43.500 --> 02:35:49.900
it play it again yeah if soccer frontier happens to sneak into my dreams you know then suddenly

02:35:49.900 --> 02:35:57.420
i wake up with the urge to vomit good i'm done with one club damn it there's more one

02:35:57.420 --> 02:36:05.420
thing in this favor it had good music it had some good music it's like that rap city musical

02:36:05.420 --> 02:36:12.420
the first village before we package that shit up and turn it back in. We did not even go

02:36:12.420 --> 02:36:18.420
That game sucked, right slide. Um, Ephemeral Fantasia, that game sucked.

02:36:18.420 --> 02:36:25.420
Is the game, it was a put out, it was a RPG put out by Konami, and apparently you can use your guitar for each controller with it?

02:36:25.420 --> 02:36:32.420
That game is ass. Dan and I barely, we didn't even get past the first village before we packaged that shit up and turned it back in.

02:36:32.420 --> 02:36:38.420
We did not even go as far to see if our controllers would work with the US version. We took that shit back.

02:36:38.420 --> 02:36:40.420
More like effeminate fantasia.

02:38:08.420 --> 02:38:10.420
I

02:38:38.420 --> 02:38:52.420
When you're coming down, you'll be alive

02:38:52.420 --> 02:38:55.420
You don't have to believe, you can call yourself

02:38:55.420 --> 02:38:59.420
When it comes time to find things you wanted to do

02:38:59.420 --> 02:39:03.420
So you don't start this city no fair

02:39:03.420 --> 02:39:06.420
If you love me baby, you can call yourself

02:39:06.420 --> 02:39:09.420
Before it won't give in

02:39:09.420 --> 02:39:12.420
While you listen to the song

02:39:12.420 --> 02:39:14.420
It's too much for me to ask

02:39:14.420 --> 02:39:17.420
Do you write a song so hard on my side?

02:39:17.420 --> 02:39:19.420
Lead up, talk to me

02:39:19.420 --> 02:39:21.420
Do you feel like I'm gonna last

02:39:21.420 --> 02:39:24.420
I'm in it all day

02:39:24.420 --> 02:39:28.420
Do you wanna be fine?

02:39:28.420 --> 02:39:30.420
If I look at you

02:39:30.420 --> 02:39:31.420
I'll be right with you

02:39:31.420 --> 02:39:33.420
Ready, ready, ready

02:40:03.420 --> 02:40:10.420
Who's on the turntables tonight, my son?

02:41:03.420 --> 02:41:31.420
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

02:41:31.420 --> 02:41:33.420
Do we want to be accepted by Hollywood?

02:41:33.420 --> 02:41:35.420
No!

02:41:35.420 --> 02:41:37.420
Do we care what people think of us?

02:41:37.420 --> 02:41:39.420
No!

02:41:39.420 --> 02:41:41.420
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

02:41:41.420 --> 02:41:43.420
Yeah!

02:41:43.420 --> 02:41:45.420
Yeah!

02:41:45.420 --> 02:41:47.420
Extreme Babati Radio

02:41:47.420 --> 02:41:51.420
That's us, Orange Lounge Radio

02:41:51.420 --> 02:41:53.420
Alright, we're back

02:41:53.420 --> 02:41:57.420
Featuring the buzz, episode number 37

02:41:57.420 --> 02:41:59.420
Episode number 37

02:41:59.420 --> 02:42:00.420
Thank you.

02:42:00.420 --> 02:42:01.420
Of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:42:01.420 --> 02:42:02.420
We're back.

02:42:02.420 --> 02:42:04.220
And we have results, results, results for you people.

02:42:04.220 --> 02:42:06.140
And then we're going to whore a few things out.

02:42:06.140 --> 02:42:11.420
We're going to give, we're going to open it up to the chat room to plug anything they

02:42:11.420 --> 02:42:12.420
want.

02:42:12.420 --> 02:42:13.940
Anything they want to plug.

02:42:13.940 --> 02:42:16.580
You got 15 minutes left to show to do it.

02:42:16.580 --> 02:42:17.580
What?

02:42:17.580 --> 02:42:20.340
Don't be afraid of people plugging stuff in public.

02:42:20.340 --> 02:42:23.660
Anything you guys want to plug, send it to me over a private message and we'll plug it.

02:42:23.660 --> 02:42:24.660
Live on air.

02:42:24.660 --> 02:42:25.660
Alright.

02:42:25.660 --> 02:42:26.900
And we got a few plugs of our own we want to do.

02:42:26.900 --> 02:42:29.260
So we're going to have plug mania in a minute.

02:42:29.260 --> 02:42:34.640
In the meantime, let's announce, first, the winners of our listless segment.

02:42:34.640 --> 02:42:38.500
Top three things that Konami needs to apologize for.

02:42:38.500 --> 02:42:39.540
Number three.

02:42:39.540 --> 02:42:40.540
Number three.

02:42:40.540 --> 02:42:41.540
Bag.

02:42:41.540 --> 02:42:42.540
Yay!

02:42:42.540 --> 02:42:44.240
Please apologize.

02:42:44.240 --> 02:42:47.740
You can send those cards and letters care of all Bomani players.

02:42:47.740 --> 02:42:48.740
Bag.

02:42:48.740 --> 02:42:49.740
Number two.

02:42:49.740 --> 02:42:50.740
Castlevania 64.

02:42:50.740 --> 02:42:51.740
Indeed.

02:42:51.740 --> 02:42:54.780
And you can write that to all of America for Castlevania 64.

02:42:54.780 --> 02:42:55.780
Apologies.

02:42:55.780 --> 02:43:01.780
The number one thing that Sami needs to apologize for is fucking Polteri.

02:43:04.780 --> 02:43:05.780
By quite a bit of a margin.

02:43:05.780 --> 02:43:07.780
She seems like she's being fucked.

02:43:07.780 --> 02:43:10.780
That's why she keeps going off key and rhythm.

02:43:10.780 --> 02:43:11.780
Alright.

02:43:12.780 --> 02:43:15.780
Moving on, now let's announce the winner of the cage match.

02:43:15.780 --> 02:43:17.780
The cage match had a lot of votes tonight, you guys.

02:43:17.780 --> 02:43:21.780
I'm very happy and it was actually kind of close.

02:43:21.780 --> 02:43:22.780
I was very surprised.

02:43:22.780 --> 02:43:45.780
What a wonderful world wins the cage match this week.

02:43:45.780 --> 02:43:47.780
I'm full of happy feelings right now.

02:43:47.780 --> 02:43:50.780
So, enjoy.

02:43:50.780 --> 02:43:53.780
Now, let's see.

02:43:53.780 --> 02:43:55.780
We're going to plug stuff.

02:43:55.780 --> 02:43:58.780
So, first thing we want to plug. There's tournaments we have to plug.

02:43:58.780 --> 02:44:05.780
In two weeks, we will be broadcasting live from March Madness.

02:44:05.780 --> 02:44:06.780
It's going to be a huge tournament.

02:44:06.780 --> 02:44:09.780
DDR Freestyle Idol is a part of that.

02:44:09.780 --> 02:44:11.780
PA 64 person bracket.

02:44:11.780 --> 02:44:14.780
So even if you suck at PA, come because you're going to qualify.

02:44:14.780 --> 02:44:16.780
With 64 people, that's awesome.

02:44:16.780 --> 02:44:20.780
Not to mention, I think the first NorCal 2DX tournament, right?

02:44:20.780 --> 02:44:24.780
Yes, the very first NorCal official 2DX tournament.

02:44:24.780 --> 02:44:28.780
I think there might have been some impromptu ones, but this is the first official 2DX tournament.

02:44:28.780 --> 02:44:30.780
That one's only on Saturday, by the way.

02:44:30.780 --> 02:44:32.780
Yes, that's Saturday night, only Saturday night.

02:44:32.780 --> 02:44:36.780
And Saturday and Sunday, both days, is the tournament.

02:44:36.780 --> 02:44:40.780
We'll be broadcasting live both days, all day long.

02:44:40.780 --> 02:44:42.780
So that's something else.

02:44:42.780 --> 02:44:47.300
Join us in the channel and all that fun stuff.

02:44:47.300 --> 02:44:51.160
Another tournament we're going to be at in May, and I'm sure I've already gotten private

02:44:51.160 --> 02:44:54.700
messages asking me to plug this, so I'll get to those in a little bit.

02:44:54.700 --> 02:45:00.680
But B3, going to be huge, Pier 39, two days, I believe it's May, and I'm going to get killed

02:45:00.680 --> 02:45:04.740
if it's the wrong date, but I'm going off the top of my head, May 17th and 18th, yes?

02:45:04.740 --> 02:45:05.740
I think.

02:45:05.740 --> 02:45:06.740
Look at the calendar.

02:45:06.740 --> 02:45:08.020
I'm going to look at the calendar, because I think I might be wrong.

02:45:08.020 --> 02:45:11.200
I have this really bad feeling I'm wrong, but somebody, I'm sure somebody asked me to

02:45:11.200 --> 02:45:12.200
plug it anyway.

02:45:12.200 --> 02:45:14.120
I'm right, it is 17th and 18th, woohoo!

02:45:14.120 --> 02:45:17.180
Okay, so we'll be broadcasting live from there, too.

02:45:17.180 --> 02:45:20.540
And then, season three of Orange Lounge Radio

02:45:20.540 --> 02:45:23.280
starts also in May, and that's gonna be a big deal,

02:45:23.280 --> 02:45:25.200
because we have a new toy

02:45:25.200 --> 02:45:26.800
that we're gonna be bringing with us.

02:45:26.800 --> 02:45:28.020
We can't say anything about it,

02:45:28.020 --> 02:45:30.160
because we don't know for sure we're gonna have it yet,

02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:31.400
but we're trying very hard.

02:45:31.400 --> 02:45:35.280
And we're gonna have a lot more wonderful interaction

02:45:35.280 --> 02:45:37.640
with audio-wise movement,

02:45:37.640 --> 02:45:41.960
hook the hell out of TVs hooked up to the sound system,

02:45:41.960 --> 02:45:46.280
other things. We get to play porn on air and all that wonderful stuff.

02:45:46.280 --> 02:45:48.840
It's going to be very interesting. Also, the other thing that's going to be different about

02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:50.920
Season 3 is that we're going to have a much larger studio.

02:45:50.920 --> 02:45:53.200
Oh, hell yeah. So that should be interesting too.

02:45:53.200 --> 02:46:00.200
Hopefully we won't suffocate to that. Okay, so let's see what the chat room wanted

02:46:01.320 --> 02:46:04.880
us to plug. Because they do this on late night talk shows. You know, they get to plug whatever

02:46:04.880 --> 02:46:07.760
they want when the guests come on. So, is there anything in here anyone would like to

02:46:07.760 --> 02:46:10.880
plug? It doesn't even have to be Monty related. Something you want to plug. That you need

02:46:10.880 --> 02:46:19.080
to date, do you need any money? As always, of course, it's going to be www.willddr4food.net

02:46:19.080 --> 02:46:24.640
slash leech from Loki. Can't forget that. Tomorrow, there will be an update. A couple

02:46:24.640 --> 02:46:29.480
hundred files will be coming up online. It's going to be the official stuff. Right now,

02:46:29.480 --> 02:46:38.720
we've got prepped, let's see, most of DDR Extreme, all of DDR First through Fifth Mix,

02:46:38.720 --> 02:46:50.720
DDR Solo and I'm going to try to get Max and Max 2 done tonight as well as the other smaller ones like OHA and all those. I think I should be able to get those done tonight. We'll see.

02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:52.720
So those will be coming out tomorrow.

02:46:54.720 --> 02:46:56.720
Anybody else want to plug something in here?

02:46:58.720 --> 02:47:00.720
I need SEX!

02:47:01.720 --> 02:47:04.720
And if they want to fuck the shit out of you, where should they email?

02:47:04.720 --> 02:47:09.720
9-1-6, go cheap.

02:47:09.720 --> 02:47:14.720
Or just look for him on the corner of 27th and J.

02:47:14.720 --> 02:47:19.720
1-900-FUCK-ASS

02:47:19.720 --> 02:47:24.720
Alright, let's go through the shower and see what they want to plug.

02:47:24.720 --> 02:47:29.720
Justin's Circuit would like us all to pay a visit to www.sifam.com

02:47:29.720 --> 02:47:57.720

Uh... 23rd Magus says he would like to plug and chug

02:48:34.960 --> 02:48:39.040
www.unglued.tk

02:48:39.040 --> 02:48:42.920
or ungluedbamani.tk. I'm not sure if they're two different sites or the same

02:48:42.920 --> 02:48:44.120
site, but visit them both.

02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:50.360
unglued.tk and ungluedbamani.tk. Fear some more and fear him the most.

02:48:50.360 --> 02:48:53.720
That's alright. And they're having a cake versus pie

02:48:53.720 --> 02:48:57.320
argument in the chat room right now. Quick, quick everybody, cake or pie?

02:48:57.320 --> 02:49:01.320
Pie. Cake. Cake. 3.14

02:49:01.320 --> 02:49:06.520
Cake. I say pie. But you know what? Cheesecake

02:49:06.520 --> 02:49:10.080
owns them both. I like cake though. I like cake better than pie.

02:49:10.080 --> 02:49:13.640
Cheesecake owns them both, end of story.

02:49:13.640 --> 02:49:17.240
Ice cream cake.

02:49:17.240 --> 02:49:21.680
Alright. Cake pie. Yes, cake flavored pie.

02:49:21.680 --> 02:49:29.680
For my birthday, I want an ice cream cake. I want a cold-stead one that's cake batter flavored with brownies in it.

02:49:29.680 --> 02:49:34.680
I want an erotic cake for my birthday. No, just like in the end of that Simpsons episode.

02:49:34.680 --> 02:49:35.680
A cake with boobies?

02:49:35.680 --> 02:49:42.680
My dad, for his 50th birthday, had a booby cake. And it was a couple of big boobs that was a cake, and then it had a little bra on it.

02:49:42.680 --> 02:49:44.680
And it had a skier, skiing down one of the boobs.

02:49:44.680 --> 02:49:46.680
Oh, slopes.

02:49:46.680 --> 02:49:49.520
Okay, enough of cake versus pie, we're done.

02:49:49.520 --> 02:49:50.520
Alright.

02:49:50.520 --> 02:49:55.080
AZHP wants us to plug NBOR3.

02:49:55.080 --> 02:49:56.080
Very good opportunity.

02:49:56.080 --> 02:50:00.480
I try to plug these occasionally, we all try to talk about our forums, but not enough people

02:50:00.480 --> 02:50:01.480
are going there.

02:50:01.480 --> 02:50:02.960
You need to visit our forums.

02:50:02.960 --> 02:50:07.560
They're at calibomani.com slash NBOR3.

02:50:07.560 --> 02:50:09.560
Or you know what, even quicker?

02:50:09.560 --> 02:50:12.720
Just go to calibomani.com and then click on forums.

02:50:12.720 --> 02:50:13.720
Awesome.

02:50:13.720 --> 02:50:16.320
Or go to the Orange Lounge website and click on forums.

02:50:16.320 --> 02:50:20.120
They go to the same place, visit the forums, post, they're the best damn forums anywhere.

02:50:20.120 --> 02:50:21.120
They're good.

02:50:21.120 --> 02:50:23.440
Except for the Gold Club Centerfolds forums, which are better.

02:50:23.440 --> 02:50:24.440
Oh my gosh.

02:50:24.440 --> 02:50:26.440
That's a strip club, by the way.

02:50:26.440 --> 02:50:33.320
If they get so much more activity on the forums, I'm like, what are you doing posting on a

02:50:33.320 --> 02:50:34.440
forum about a strip club?

02:50:34.440 --> 02:50:39.080
How sad is that that people just constantly visit strip clubs, then they go post about

02:50:39.080 --> 02:50:40.080
it on a forum.

02:50:40.080 --> 02:50:42.880
I'll tell you what else is funny, the Gold Club Centerfolds forum, which is a strip bar

02:50:42.880 --> 02:50:56.880
I would also like to plug Neopets.com. Go there, earn lots of Neopoints, and give them

02:50:56.880 --> 02:50:57.880
to me.

02:50:57.880 --> 02:51:03.480
Snub Dispenoid would like to say, Paranoid survivor MaxoniSteps has a max combo of 641

02:51:03.480 --> 02:51:07.240
and has slides inside the final runs. How the hell can anyone pass that? Just thought

02:51:07.240 --> 02:51:08.240
I would share slash ask.

02:51:08.240 --> 02:51:10.240
This is not Ask Orange Lounge.

02:51:10.240 --> 02:51:12.240
Yes, this is NASCAR. I'm sorry

02:51:14.320 --> 02:51:19.200
Because slowly over time playing DVR you will slowly become Asian

02:51:20.120 --> 02:51:26.640
Once you've achieved the ultimate Asian status, you will be able to pass that song but only then

02:51:27.320 --> 02:51:31.480
Will you be able to pass that song and not before then the machine must choose you

02:51:32.080 --> 02:51:34.360
Then you'll become the last starfighter

02:51:34.360 --> 02:51:40.440
Japan Man wants me to plug a site that's like a two-year-old internet joke, so when you

02:51:40.440 --> 02:51:49.440
find something funny that's new, let me know, because Goat Sei is like two years old, okay?

02:51:49.440 --> 02:51:54.880
Dark Tetsuya says that look out for his DWI for love and the angel, it's in the making.

02:51:54.880 --> 02:51:56.960
And will he be hosting that on Leech and Wookie?

02:51:56.960 --> 02:51:57.960
Who knows?

02:51:57.960 --> 02:51:58.960
I hope so.

02:51:58.960 --> 02:52:03.040
Yeah, that's another thing about my site, pretty soon it's going to be really easy to

02:52:03.040 --> 02:52:08.800
upload files, like, really, really, really easy. So, yeah.

02:52:08.800 --> 02:52:14.120
Okay, morethanjake543 says, I need someone to do something that will make Rio shut down

02:52:14.120 --> 02:52:21.120
for a day. That's his school. Oh, ratemyhuck.com. Uh-oh, I'm scared to know what a huck is.

02:52:21.120 --> 02:52:23.600
I don't know what a huck is. Let's see what a huck is.

02:52:23.600 --> 02:52:26.480
Is that like a pecker? I don't know. Let's find out. I hope so.

02:52:26.480 --> 02:52:31.280
Is that a cog? It's a cog. Let's see, we're going to ratemyhuck. I wonder

02:52:31.280 --> 02:52:32.280
I wonder if it's vomit.

02:52:32.280 --> 02:52:33.280
Hux kind of sounds like vomit.

02:52:33.280 --> 02:52:38.120
No, because I'm going to rate my huck.

02:52:38.120 --> 02:52:39.120
Here it is.

02:52:39.120 --> 02:52:40.600
It's a Norwegian thing.

02:52:40.600 --> 02:52:43.200
If this is poop or something, I'm going to be pissed.

02:52:43.200 --> 02:52:45.080
Oh, it's biking.

02:52:45.080 --> 02:52:46.080
Okay.

02:52:46.080 --> 02:52:47.080
Okay.

02:52:47.080 --> 02:52:48.080
Alright.

02:52:48.080 --> 02:52:49.080
Okay.

02:52:49.080 --> 02:52:50.080
That I can do.

02:52:50.080 --> 02:52:51.080
That I can deal with.

02:52:51.080 --> 02:52:52.080
Rate my...

02:52:52.080 --> 02:52:53.080
Do they have RateMyCock.com?

02:52:53.080 --> 02:52:55.600
It's like a bicycle thing.

02:52:55.600 --> 02:52:56.600
Okay.

02:52:56.600 --> 02:52:57.600
That's fine.

02:52:57.600 --> 02:52:58.600
RateMyHuck is acceptable.

02:52:58.600 --> 02:52:59.600
Rob, see if they have RateMyCock.

02:52:59.600 --> 02:53:17.600
ratemycock.com

02:53:17.600 --> 02:53:23.300
Okay, let's see. We're going to enter.

02:53:23.300 --> 02:53:26.100
There is a RaidMyCock.com.

02:53:26.100 --> 02:53:30.400
Uh, yeah!

02:53:30.400 --> 02:53:32.200
What do you guys think?

02:53:32.200 --> 02:53:35.700
I still think that the penis is the funniest looking thing in the world.

02:53:35.700 --> 02:53:38.200
Praise God for internet porn.

02:53:38.200 --> 02:53:42.000
I would give that, oh, I'd say about a five on size.

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:43.500
Style?

02:53:43.500 --> 02:53:45.000
No, okay, I'll give it a seven.

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:50.000
Okay, let's go to the next cock. Let's look at the next one.

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:55.000
Okay, we're going to look at one more cock, then we're done.

02:53:55.000 --> 02:54:00.000
They have their name, and then they have the cock.

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:05.000
Oh, I want him.

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:10.000
Okay, you have to log in to vote, and I'm not going to log in.

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:13.000
I don't know if you want to rape people's cock.

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:14.000
This is great.

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:17.320
The greatest thing about the site, even if you're straight, this is funny.

02:54:17.320 --> 02:54:20.720
I swear, if you're a straight guy, this is still funny because it has their name and

02:54:20.720 --> 02:54:21.720
then their cock's name.

02:54:21.720 --> 02:54:23.720
That is so photoshopped, okay?

02:54:23.720 --> 02:54:27.120
God, I hope the neighbors aren't listening.

02:54:27.120 --> 02:54:28.120
More plugging.

02:54:28.120 --> 02:54:36.760
Sautome Ron Mo would like to plug www.starmen.net as well as my huge, huge penis.

02:54:36.760 --> 02:54:38.760
How many Neopoints do you need, Jamie?

02:54:38.760 --> 02:54:42.760
I'm actually about 30,000 away from my next bank account.

02:54:42.760 --> 02:54:44.760
I'll take whatever I can get.

02:54:44.760 --> 02:54:48.760
My Neopets name is DJ underscore Celica.

02:54:48.760 --> 02:54:53.760
Yes, we got a lot of cool new listeners from Starman.net, so go visit them.

02:54:53.760 --> 02:54:57.760
Especially if you like Earthbound, which you should because it was the greatest Super Nintendo game ever.

02:54:57.760 --> 02:55:02.760
23rd Magus would like to plug Pi, American Pi style.

02:55:02.760 --> 02:55:08.760
We don't need to know about your secret nighttime activities involving pies.

02:55:08.760 --> 02:55:13.760
And Rice would like to... This is the greatest site. Okay, in all seriousness, this is the greatest site.

02:55:13.760 --> 02:55:18.760
Rice is having us plug the greatest site. RYC3 would like us to plug RateMyKitten.com.

02:55:18.760 --> 02:55:22.760
It is the cutest site. No, let's go. Let's go. Let's visit it. Let's visit it. Okay.

02:55:22.760 --> 02:55:24.760
I should put pictures of Shermie on there.

02:55:24.760 --> 02:55:27.760
Let's visit. It's pussy that's actually good!

02:55:27.760 --> 02:55:33.760
I want to see more kitties!

02:55:33.760 --> 02:55:37.760
I love doing this because all I...you just hear this be ahhh!

02:55:37.760 --> 02:55:38.760
I want to see more kitties!

02:55:38.760 --> 02:55:39.760
We're like one big girl.

02:55:39.760 --> 02:55:41.760
Okay, what do we rate this kitten?

02:55:41.760 --> 02:55:42.760
He has the cans up the kitten's ass.

02:55:42.760 --> 02:55:43.760
Yeah, he has the cans up the kitten's ass.

02:55:43.760 --> 02:55:44.760
Okay, here's another kitten.

02:55:44.760 --> 02:55:45.760
Okay, here's another kitten.

02:55:45.760 --> 02:55:46.760
Ahhhh!

02:55:46.760 --> 02:55:54.760
Yes, I like doing this just for the sound effects, okay?

02:55:54.760 --> 02:55:55.760
This is great radio.

02:55:55.760 --> 02:56:02.760
radio. This Indian's home has dinner already for tonight. Okay, okay, one more just for

02:56:02.760 --> 02:56:10.760
the sound effect. Here we go. Ready? One more just for the sound effect. That one looked

02:56:10.760 --> 02:56:14.760
kind of mean, so it didn't get quite the reaction we were hoping for. Okay, let's try this.

02:56:14.760 --> 02:56:24.760
Okay, it's getting old. Okay. Okay. Okay, go to this side. All right, Rob. Okay, okay,

02:56:24.760 --> 02:56:39.760
This is my cat, who owns all cats.

02:56:39.760 --> 02:56:43.760
This is Shermy sleeping in a pizza box.

02:56:43.760 --> 02:56:49.760
Shermy is a big cat. You've got to realize that when this cat is standing up and walking around, it looks like a soccer ball.

02:56:49.760 --> 02:56:51.760
But Shermy is cute.

02:56:51.760 --> 02:56:56.760
Very cute, very cuddly, very nice, very sweet and all that. But oh my god, I have never seen a cat get so big.

02:56:56.760 --> 02:57:02.760
It's because she doesn't do anything but lay around. I tried to chase her back and forth to make her hop over my legs, chasing the feather.

02:57:02.760 --> 02:57:06.760
And then she sat down and was like, you can be the feather to me, bitch.

02:57:06.760 --> 02:57:09.760
That's my baby. Isn't she cute?

02:57:09.760 --> 02:57:17.760
And by the way, you'll also see a few neat things in the background, like a 32X and an activator.

02:57:17.760 --> 02:57:19.760
Some of Jamie's toys.

02:57:19.760 --> 02:57:23.760
And you're a keyboard mania controller.

02:57:23.760 --> 02:57:30.760
Okay, uh, me and my friend were playing Vice City His Place. Then what happens? He starts firing at some cops when this black man just jumps on the bike.

02:57:30.760 --> 02:57:33.760
I think he came from this hole.

02:57:33.760 --> 02:57:34.760
What?

02:57:34.760 --> 02:57:38.760
So, he found a man whore in Vice City, I guess. It's like some big deal.

02:57:38.760 --> 02:57:40.760
Huh.

02:57:40.760 --> 02:57:42.760
That's beautiful.

02:57:42.760 --> 02:57:43.760
Wow.

02:57:43.760 --> 02:57:50.760
More thanjake would like us to plug collegehumor.com and mycathateyou.com

02:57:50.760 --> 02:57:52.760
Ooh, the other side of it. Let's see, let's have a look at it.

02:57:52.760 --> 02:57:55.760
mycathateyou.com

02:57:55.760 --> 02:57:58.760
How's the mean little kitty?

02:57:58.760 --> 02:57:59.760
Oh no!

02:57:59.760 --> 02:58:01.760
I've seen that picture over e-mail.

02:58:01.760 --> 02:58:03.760
I know about that.

02:58:03.760 --> 02:58:04.760
About the line.

02:58:04.760 --> 02:58:06.760
Oh, these are all like, mean cats.

02:58:06.760 --> 02:58:07.760
Oh, that's a cool one.

02:58:07.760 --> 02:58:12.760
Okay, okay. This is an awesome site. It's, uh, hctp dot, alright, it's actually, um,

02:58:12.760 --> 02:58:18.760
madox, m-a-d-d-o-x dot xmission dot com.

02:58:20.760 --> 02:58:21.760
Uh, oops.

02:58:21.760 --> 02:58:22.760
No WWE.

02:58:22.760 --> 02:58:23.760
No WWE.

02:58:25.760 --> 02:58:26.760
Okay, here we go.

02:58:27.760 --> 02:58:31.760
The best page in the universe. Oh, is this the one where he rips on the little kid's

02:58:31.760 --> 02:58:32.760
arms and stuff?

02:58:32.760 --> 02:58:34.760
Yeah, but he, there's much more of that. Let's see here.

02:58:34.760 --> 02:58:39.760
Oh, who would make a better President Bush or a box of Tic Tacs?

02:58:39.760 --> 02:58:41.760
That's beautiful.

02:58:41.760 --> 02:58:43.760
Wait, wait, look at this picture. This is the best.

02:58:43.760 --> 02:58:45.760
Um...

02:58:45.760 --> 02:58:47.760
Oh, here we go.

02:58:49.760 --> 02:58:51.760
Wonderful.

02:58:51.760 --> 02:58:53.760
All right, so I'll, uh...

02:58:53.760 --> 02:58:58.760
I'm gonna post that to the chat room if they'd like to check out that little ball of joy.

02:58:58.760 --> 02:59:03.760
Let's see what, uh, Sharkscroll wanted us to plug.

02:59:03.760 --> 02:59:08.760
Oh, she says to tell Jamie that I will send her, Shermie, and horse pics.

02:59:08.760 --> 02:59:09.760
Very cool.

02:59:09.760 --> 02:59:13.760
Yes, go ahead and email that to me so I can have my tiger horsey.

02:59:13.760 --> 02:59:16.760
Callie Bamani wants us to plug topromin.com.

02:59:16.760 --> 02:59:17.760
It's a porn site.

02:59:17.760 --> 02:59:18.760
Is it?

02:59:18.760 --> 02:59:20.760
I wouldn't have guessed.

02:59:20.760 --> 02:59:21.760
I like it.

02:59:21.760 --> 02:59:23.760
I like porn.

02:59:23.760 --> 02:59:24.760
Matt's saying, I like ramen.

02:59:24.760 --> 02:59:26.760
I like porn.

02:59:26.760 --> 02:59:28.760
Okay, it is a porn site.

02:59:28.760 --> 02:59:29.760
Beautiful.

02:59:29.760 --> 02:59:45.760
I would also like to plug cospa.co.jp for any cosplayers, it's a site that sells pre-made cosplay pieces, but also it's very good images on things that you can make for your own costumes.

02:59:45.760 --> 02:59:53.760
And also tokyostreets.com for anyone who's into the whole fruits fashion, it has pictures of street fashion in Tokyo.

02:59:53.760 --> 02:59:57.760
Okay, 23rd Magus would like a way to plug my BWC.

02:59:58.760 --> 02:59:59.760
Big white cock?

02:59:59.760 --> 03:00:00.760
I don't know.

03:00:00.760 --> 03:00:01.760
Okay.

03:00:01.760 --> 03:00:03.760
These are the last plugs, you guys, and we're going to end the show.

03:00:03.760 --> 03:00:05.760
Get the final thoughts, end the show.

03:00:05.760 --> 03:00:08.760
Brack2000 wants to plug emotioneric.com.

03:00:08.760 --> 03:00:09.760
Yes, this site is very cool.

03:00:09.760 --> 03:00:10.760
Thank you.

03:00:10.760 --> 03:00:11.760
Thank you for plugging this.

03:00:11.760 --> 03:00:12.760
This is a great site.

03:00:12.760 --> 03:00:18.760
This is this guy, and all he does is he emotes things.

03:00:18.760 --> 03:00:19.760
So let me show you.

03:00:19.760 --> 03:00:20.760
Like here.

03:00:20.760 --> 03:00:22.760
God damn, these fucking pop-up ads.

03:00:22.760 --> 03:00:27.960
all

03:00:27.960 --> 03:00:30.720
for love

03:00:30.720 --> 03:00:33.560
mode icon for drunk

03:00:33.560 --> 03:00:37.960
and then we get to like kill number three

03:00:37.960 --> 03:00:41.080
finding dead body in the trunk

03:00:41.080 --> 03:00:42.120
but

03:00:42.120 --> 03:00:46.160
uh... freedom

03:00:46.160 --> 03:00:50.680
so you motion eric dot com great uh... many as pending requests

03:00:50.680 --> 03:00:53.840
he also takes requests like yoga, fire, and things like that.

03:00:53.840 --> 03:00:57.040
Okay, uh, what is the request?

03:00:57.040 --> 03:00:58.000
Home Star Runner!

03:00:58.000 --> 03:00:59.760
Rise Princess, Home Star Runner.

03:00:59.760 --> 03:01:00.880
Yes!

03:01:00.880 --> 03:01:03.040
I'm sure everybody on the internet has seen that.

03:01:03.040 --> 03:01:05.560
Alrighty, late late, ending late, yeah big deal.

03:01:05.560 --> 03:01:08.000
So what, it's our show.

03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:12.600
Oh, Cali Bamani says, I would never go to a site like that, Sean found it.

03:01:12.600 --> 03:01:16.200
Sure.

03:01:16.200 --> 03:01:20.360
Alright, that's it, we got all the plugs in, so

03:01:20.360 --> 03:01:22.360
Thank you for helping to participate.

03:01:22.360 --> 03:01:30.360
I want Loki to read on air the article Maddox wrote about vegetarianism for morals on the Maddox.xmission.com.

03:01:30.360 --> 03:01:32.360
You up for it?

03:01:32.360 --> 03:01:34.360
I've read all of his articles, so...

03:01:34.360 --> 03:01:36.360
Where's the vegetarian one?

03:01:36.360 --> 03:01:38.360
Let me find it.

03:01:38.360 --> 03:01:41.360
That's the continuity one with Daredevil, the movie.

03:01:41.360 --> 03:01:43.360
Let's see here.

03:01:43.360 --> 03:01:45.360
Oh, this one's funny too, but I'm not going to read that one.

03:01:45.360 --> 03:01:48.360
PETA, preventing suffering.

03:01:48.360 --> 03:01:52.360
Wait, that's hate mail, I think.

03:01:52.360 --> 03:01:55.360
That might be the one.

03:01:55.360 --> 03:01:59.360
It's about the guiltless grill.

03:01:59.360 --> 03:02:01.360
Make it quick, we've got to end the show.

03:02:01.360 --> 03:02:02.360
Long fucking article.

03:02:02.360 --> 03:02:03.360
First paragraph.

03:02:03.360 --> 03:02:07.360
PETA stands for People Before the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

03:02:07.360 --> 03:02:09.360
Let's ignore that for a moment.

03:02:09.360 --> 03:02:12.360
That implies that there exists a universal set of ethics

03:02:12.360 --> 03:02:15.360
instead of let's focus on the meat of this email.

03:02:15.360 --> 03:02:18.660
that is primarily concerned with preventing and suffering of living animals.

03:02:18.660 --> 03:02:19.660
Oh really?

03:02:19.660 --> 03:02:22.420
As opposed to preventing and suffering of dead animals?

03:02:22.420 --> 03:02:26.500
Good thing they clarified that because I was confused and couldn't infer that they were

03:02:26.500 --> 03:02:30.660
saying animals that they didn't mean dead animals.

03:02:30.660 --> 03:02:31.660
Glad we have cleared that up.

03:02:31.660 --> 03:02:32.660
Let's move on.

03:02:32.660 --> 03:02:33.660
Alright, that's enough.

03:02:33.660 --> 03:02:37.700
Anyways, to basically summarize that, he's just telling that more animals get killed

03:02:37.700 --> 03:02:40.300
in the harvesting of grain than by a sin.

03:02:40.300 --> 03:02:46.300
So what he says is, for every one piece of, like, or every steak that they're not going to eat, he's going to eat three.

03:02:46.300 --> 03:02:49.300
That's awful.

03:02:49.300 --> 03:02:52.300
All right.

03:02:52.300 --> 03:02:59.300
And I'm getting asked to play the second song that JB sent me, which I will do after the show is over.

03:02:59.300 --> 03:03:01.300
So, let's get to those final thoughts.

03:03:01.300 --> 03:03:04.300
Guess first. Zero?

03:03:04.300 --> 03:03:05.300
Is he here?

03:03:05.300 --> 03:03:06.300
Somewhere, he's hiding.

03:03:06.300 --> 03:03:07.300
No, I ran away.

03:03:07.300 --> 03:03:20.300
No, um, I guess my final thought is pretty much, um, yeah, have as many parties as you possibly can because they're really fun and you can get drunk and you can make an ass out of yourself.

03:03:25.300 --> 03:03:28.300
I have to say in that motion, ass is good but then so is boobs.

03:03:31.300 --> 03:03:35.300
Um, okay, I don't think you said ass is good and so are boobs.

03:03:35.300 --> 03:03:41.300
I'm sorry, let me clarify. Ass is good, and so is booze. That's an alcohol.

03:03:41.300 --> 03:03:48.300
Okay, glad we clarified that. My final thought? Be happy. That's all I got to say.

03:03:48.300 --> 03:03:52.300
My final thought is black CDRs are really red.

03:03:52.300 --> 03:04:04.300
Vegetarians suck. You should eat all the meat that's possible, otherwise cows go to waste. You care to counter that?

03:04:04.300 --> 03:04:11.300
That sucks.

03:04:11.300 --> 03:04:15.300
For those of you who don't know, I am a vegetarian.

03:04:15.300 --> 03:04:19.300
I don't eat cows or pigs because I don't want a heart attack.

03:04:19.300 --> 03:04:21.300
I say we just eat the vegetarians.

03:04:21.300 --> 03:04:24.300
I say we kill you and waste your meat.

03:04:24.300 --> 03:04:26.300
Cannibalism.

03:04:26.300 --> 03:04:29.300
I could go into this, it's just too long.

03:04:29.300 --> 03:04:31.300
And then we trap your soul and make you watch your body rot.

03:04:31.300 --> 03:04:34.300
Let's see, salad or BEEF!

03:04:34.300 --> 03:04:35.300
How's that?

03:04:35.300 --> 03:04:36.300
Beef it is!

03:04:36.300 --> 03:04:38.300
Sausage is always good for me.

03:04:38.300 --> 03:04:41.300
Stop it with the gay references!

03:04:41.300 --> 03:04:44.300
Did everybody get to do the final thought except me?

03:04:44.300 --> 03:04:48.300
Well, I want to know if Loki would kill his own cow to get his beef.

03:04:48.300 --> 03:04:50.300
Oh damn, that'd be fun!

03:04:50.300 --> 03:04:53.300
It's all, oof, oof, oof, oof, oof!

03:04:53.300 --> 03:05:00.300
In reference to that, Dennis Leary did have the funniest thing regarding being pro meat eating.

03:05:00.300 --> 03:05:04.300
and that was, bring out a live cow, I'll carve off what I want and ride the rest home.

03:05:04.300 --> 03:05:11.300
And if one of the meat eaters had a heart attack and fell over, we'd just throw him in the pit too. More meat for the meat eaters!

03:05:11.300 --> 03:05:18.300
I wouldn't kill my cow, I would get a guy cow and make them have more cows, and then I would kill them and eat them.

03:05:18.300 --> 03:05:24.300
Beautiful. My final thought for the day is, uh, Kuntai. Good night!

03:05:24.300 --> 03:05:29.740

03:05:56.380 --> 03:05:59.860
Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.

03:05:59.860 --> 03:06:03.300
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.

03:06:03.300 --> 03:06:08.780
Yo, G, I'll be here to see why your homies ain't working their booties off.

I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.

03:06:12.220 --> 03:06:18.220
We be seein' if they get this ride goin' with 60 foot 7 of black staring down him.

03:06:18.220 --> 03:06:21.220
I tell you if this station will be operational, it's not.

03:06:21.220 --> 03:06:26.220
Man, don't think of any of you cruisin' down here to check out this ride.

03:06:26.220 --> 03:06:28.220
The Emperor's coming here?

03:06:28.220 --> 03:06:31.220
Yeah, and he gonna put a cap in your white ass.

03:06:31.220 --> 03:06:33.220
We shall double our efforts.

03:06:33.220 --> 03:06:40.220
