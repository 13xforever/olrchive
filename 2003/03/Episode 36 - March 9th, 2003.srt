00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Oh! Message for you sir! Attention!

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,300
which may contain hot monkey sex.

3
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,300
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

4
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,300
In this episode...

5
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,300
Hey, is any gold down there?

6
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,800
That's the biggest berry I've ever seen, Jingleberry.

7
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,300
What's your favorite security movie?

8
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,300
Showgirls. Absolutely frightening.

9
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,300
What's yours?

10
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,300
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

11
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,300
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.

12
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:04,300
I don't get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too!

13
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,300
I know kung-fu.

14
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,300
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

15
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,300
Why did they have to take the word gay?

16
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,300
No! What I expect for Spanish exposition is handsome.

17
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,300
Hey!

18
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,300
Dark Sakurai.

19
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,300
Shut up!

20
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,300
Where's my gun? This is my boomstick.

21
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,300
Sky.

22
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,300
Come on, girls, it's time to drop the bomb.

23
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,300
Loki.

24
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,800
I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex and wait.

25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,800
What kind of warped human being would find that funny?

26
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,800

I killed twenty so far.

90
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,960
The last time you played Animal Crossing was when Joe was on the show last, I think.

91
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,620
No, it was like a month ago.

92
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,540
Did you like what I did with your house?

93
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:35,280
I gave you a matching floor and wall and some furniture that went with that set. It's the cabana set.

94
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,260
Like trading spaces.

95
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,200
Have you ever watched that show?

96
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,080
My mom watches that.

97
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,080
They're the best of season one of that stupid show on DVD now. Sad.

98
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,080
I'm waiting for the gay wedding's DVD. That show's the shit.

99
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,080
Oh, God. What?

100
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,080
We're giving a shout-out. Shout-out!

101
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,080
Do shout-outs, Jamie.

102
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,080
Yo! All you people who want shout-outs, yo, I'm just not gonna name anybody.

103
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,080
What's up, Jerry?

104
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,080
Yo.

105
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,080
What's up? Okay.

106
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,080
Anyway, I say we go to a break.

107
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,080
Hello to our chat room. If you want to join our chat room, go to orangelounge.skie.cx and come chat.

108
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,080
and then you should also post in our forums, because our forums have been kind of dead, and we need people to post in them.

109
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,080
Not in the quote forum, my god.

110
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,080
No, not the quote forum.

111
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,080
Whoa, but everything else has been dead.

112
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,080
So we need people to go there and post love letters, if you wouldn't mind.

113
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,080
I need a lot of attention, and so does Jamie.

114
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:35,080
Jamie likes attention, so go post your love and affection letters to Jamie, and then Loki, tell him what a dick he is.

115
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,080
Jerk.

116
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,080
Tell him you don't appreciate those racial slurs and homophobic comments, and what else has he said on this show?

117
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,080
Yeah, you porn-monger you.

118
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,080
What the hell? I'm like totally opposite from everyone I'm perceiving me as.

119
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,080
Like some crazy racist guy out there.

120
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,080
I should just shave my head and join the Ku Klux Klan and shit, man.

121
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,080
I don't know what the problem is.

122
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,080
You were saying, Loki?

123
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
All I have to say is you should have been there last night.

124
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,080
We were playing this game, loaded questions.

125
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,080
And Brad had to answer this question,

126
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,360
What's the problem that you would fix in America and he said well we should get rid of all the I'll just leave the rest

127
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,960
Of your imagination, but he got a lot of stuff thrown at him

128
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,680
All right

129
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,940
Yeah deprivation and now you had a lot to draw we'll talk about drinking

130
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,280
We got to drink I was tired yeah, that stuff's pretty strong. That stuff was weak

131
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,800
No, you wonder what's worse than right? You have what three shots, and you were giggling on the floor rolling around

132
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,520
I feel like stuff that you and you didn't move

133
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,520
I don't have to be drunk to do that.

134
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,520
I don't have to be drunk to do that.

135
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,520
You put peanut butter cups on your head, too.

136
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,520
I put one in your ear.

137
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,520
No, wait, wait, hold on.

138
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,520
I got one thing to say.

139
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,520
You want to know what's worse than writing what was written?

140
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,520
Was being the one who had to read it out loud

141
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,520
and being afraid everyone's going to attack you

142
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,520
instead of the person who wrote it.

143
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,520
Because everyone knew who wrote it.

144
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,520
Who tried to balance this bottle of Smirnoff black on me

145
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,520
while I was sleeping?

146
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,520
Was that you?

147
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,520
That wasn't fun.

148
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,520
Wasn't fun.

149
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,520
I was turned upside down.

150
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,520
Can we go to break now?

151
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,520
Yeah, let's go to break.

152
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,520
Alright, bye.

153
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,520
We'll be back.

154
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:17,480
Okay, I guess we're going to do one more, because I've got these much better parody

155
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,760
lyrics for Bumblebee than that shit I did a little bit ago, so we're going to do this

156
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,760
one instead.

157
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,960
This comes from DDR Angel and Stressa.

158
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,440
This is much better, so enjoy.

159
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:51,440
I know I'm going to fuck this up, I apologize, I'm late.

160
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,440
Just a four-sex fantasy

161
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
My foot kicks your ass when you walk in the room

162
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,940
I go boom-boom-boom, you go zoom-zoom-zoom

I'll shove my foot right up your ass

166
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,440
To help you see it's true

167
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,440
I don't like you, can't you see?

168
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,440
Now get the fuck away from me!

169
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,440
Sweet little Bumblebee, get the fuck away from me!

170

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I see you how I'm feeling My hustle far away, so clean

Hangin' a dream in the rain

175
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,180
Hangin' a shadow more clear

176
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,180
It's time to say goodnight to my friend

177
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,180
I'm the true love

178
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,180
I'm ready to be happy

179
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,180
It's my time for me to say goodnight

180
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,180
Goodnight for you

181
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,680
You don't have to love me

182
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,680
You can't just leave me

183
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,180
Don't you do that

184
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,180
Goodnight for you

185
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,180
I can't take it over

186
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,860
I don't need anyone

187
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,420
I'm sorry, I'm sorry I kon failing

188
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:46,800
There's no reason I don't need any of this

189
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,560
I still can't find

190
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,560
But you mustn't need that light

191
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,560
Don't let it in your reality

192
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,560
I'm gonna lose you

193
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,560
Cause I have made up my mind

194
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,560
For it's part of my to say

195
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,560
That that's it for you

196
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,560
You don't have to love me again

197
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,560
To say I'm gonna lose you

198
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,560
That that's it for you

199
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,560
I can't take it no more

200
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,560
I don't want you anymore

201
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:24,560
I say for you, you don't have to love me, can you say you're going to love me?

202
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,560
I say for you, I can't take you over, I don't want you anymore

203
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,560
I think being is so smart

204
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:24,560
The Orange Lounge Radio with the Bing Pong Ball!

205
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,560
Yay, we're back!

206
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,560
Yay, we are back!

207
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,560
Did you miss us?

208
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,560
Bork, bork, bork!

209
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,440
Enough of that, Brick, we have bumbled these guys' moisture mixtures just for the fact

210
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,720
that I wanted to annoy Rob with it.

211
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,720
Thank you, by the way, Jamie, for embarrassing me, because I had no idea she was going to be playing that.

212
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:48,720
And, surprisingly enough, a lot of people in the chat room have not heard that before, and a lot of people want to get an MP3 of that.

213
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,720
I'm not sure I should be advertising this. I find that thing quite embarrassing. I don't know why you guys like it so much.

214
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,720
Who wants it? PM me.

215
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,720
No, I'll tell you. I'll tell you what, even better.

216
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:03,720
Talk to Stressa. I don't know if he's awake right now or active in chat. I'm not sure. I can't really see the chat room from where I'm sitting.

217
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,320
Jamie's in the chat tonight, but Stressa if you're awake, Stressa has a DWI for it

218
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,340
with the background and steps and the mp3 and everything and it's this really

219
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:17,520
horrible picture of me doing this, you know I'm doing that pussy eating face

220
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:26,580
where I'm like making a V with my fingers. Anyway, if you want if you want

221
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:31,560
DWIs go and ask Stressa who's, is he in chat? He's not even in chat right now is

222
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:37,260
I guess he's out, but when he's when he's around ask him about it, and I think some other folks might have it

223
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,440
DDR angel I know has it, but she's on vacation right now in Japan

224
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:47,840
Well, we'll figure we'll find a way for you folks yet. I'm sure Loki will put it up speaking of DW eyes and Loki

225
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:55,360
Farm pretzels right now man. Oh his mouth is full my bad. Well. How was your week, Jamie?

226
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,760
We'll get back to that. I wish is everybody gonna eat, so I have to just sit here and just talk to myself

227
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,760
How are you Zero?

228
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,760
I'm fine.

229
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,760
Fine.

230
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,760
I have new horses.

231
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,760
You have new horses?

232
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,760
Oh, let's talk about yesterday's trip.

233
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,760
That was fun.

234
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,760
We went to Las Vegas yesterday.

235
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,760
That was fun.

236
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,600
To go play Derby Owner's Crack.

237
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,800
For those that don't know what Derby Owner's Crack is, it's called Derby Owner's Crack,

238
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,960
and it's a game where you race horsies, and it's a lot of fun.

239
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,440
It's like initial D, but horses, but you don't actually ride the horses like you drive the

240
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,440
car.

241
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,440
You just whip them.

242
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,920
You have a big button for your whip, and you just beat your horse to get them to run faster,

243
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,360
and you breed them.

244
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,280
And then if you do well in the races, people give you things.

245
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:38,060
I have a horse named Polteri, and she gets chicks and pussies.

246
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,560
Every time I win a race, a chick will come to the table, or a cat.

247
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,080
So Polteri gets the chicks and gets the pussy.

248
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,080
What can you say?

249
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,080
Hi.

250
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,080
We're doing a show.

251
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,080
Hi.

252
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,080
Hello.

253
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,080
What's up?

254
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,080
What's going on?

255
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,080
Hey, wait.

256
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,080
Anita, Anita, Anita.

257
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,080
Come back.

258
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,080
Anita, come say hi.

259
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,080
Hi.

260
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,080
Hi, everybody.

261
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,080
How are you?

262
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,080
We don't get women on this show very often, and poor Jamie's starting to...

263
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,080
Hey!

264
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,880
were bitching about this the other day that you're like

265
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,080
i'm the only woman on that whole show

266
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,380
it only takes like a few because women rule

267
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:15,140
oh is it going to be one of those nights? Every one of us is at least worth a thousand of you

268
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,300
is this going to be one of those nights where it sounds like we're at some like

269
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:24,000
women's rights march and my vagina is a vortex from which all life

270
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,320
explodes

271
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,860
uh... lastly got orange out

272
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,100
uh... by the way and i did find a site for derby owners club so you can see what the

273
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,680
machine looks like

274
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,380
go to

275
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:42,660
expert doc dot flex dot com and you'll post that in the chat room won't you i just did

276
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,460
already okay

277
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,480
that is derby owners club

278
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,180
it's very casino like it's very very casino it's purposely looking like that

279
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,020
i made

280
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:58,220
I made 40 horses, one of them was called This is a Horse, and the other one was called Happy

281
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:01,180
Bunny which won a bunch of races.

282
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:07,980
And then I made Hot Petutti, bless my soul, I really love that, rock and roll.

283
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,240
And then Mel and Melody let me use two other horses to breed a horse because I used one

284
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,720
called Vanilla Ice, it was all albino.

285
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:21,740
And then Saved by the Bell, as in B-E-L-L-E, the front part was black and the back was

286
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:27,500
white, and I bred a tiger horse. Gold and white with tiger stripes and gold eyes and

287
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,620
a tiger tail and everything.

288
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:33,820
It looks like a tiger, but it's a horse! What's up with that?

289
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,860
I thought it was going to be a boy, because I've been breeding nothing but boys lately,

290
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,460
and this one was a girl, so I couldn't get the name I originally wanted.

291
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,980
Last week on Orange Lounge, I've been breeding nothing but boys lately.

292
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,980
So I named it Strong Badette.

293
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,060
Very nice.

294
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,260
And my other horse's name is for people who have missed it.

295
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,980
My first horse was Slytherin Chaser.

296
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,820
Because you're a Harry Potter whore.

297
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,940
And then I had, um, I Like Cheese.

298
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,180
And then Hot Man Sex, S-E-C-H-S.

299
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,580
Because the machine will try to censor you.

300
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:12,100
And then I had, um, Mmm Fajitas.

301
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,380
And Jin Kazama, because I'm a Tekken whore.

302
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,380
Very nice.

303
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,540
I made two new horses yesterday.

304
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,100
I made a horse dedicated to one of my favorite Animal Crossing characters, Elmer.

305
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,020
So I made Elmer the horse, and then I made a horse called Sir Mix-a-Lot.

306
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,260
My next horse I'm gonna make is called Glue Factory.

307
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,620
Glue Factory? Glue Factory. Very nice.

308
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:35,300
Rob is the funny. I'm just reading that I'm trying to catch up on chat room, so...

309
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,580
Horsey sex is bad, I want to make a law about that. HORSEYS HAVE TO HAVE SEX TOO!

310
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,780
Have you ever seen a horse? No, that's the thing about Derby Owners Club.

311
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,600
ok Derby owners club has this like really explicit birthing scene to it

312
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,200
like when you make when you make a new horse for the first time

313
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,200
they go on a date they send off the horses and they trot off

314
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,000
and then like if they go to a tree and it fades out so you don't have to see

315
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,720
horsey sex

316
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,240
but in the next scene is like them in a stable and then like you see the male

317
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,780
horse like you know being all like

318
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,080
nurturing or whatever. The male horse is there kinda lookin

319
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,280
the male horse is just kinda lookin. No the mare is laying down. All I know is that you see the

320
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,300
female horse and all of a sudden it looks like she's gonna take a giant crap

321
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:22,380
and then all of a sudden there's a little baby I swear to God that's what I saw

322
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:28,200
no yes yes thank you the mare is laying down and the foal is laying beside her and the

323
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,640
foal gets up and goes you know it's like suddenly there's another horse and then

324
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,880
suddenly it's an adult oh then my happy bunny is still childish that horse sure

325
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,420
looks like mister garrison

326
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,320
i would not want to be mister

327
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,200
the chat rooms referencing a movie called freddy got finger which i never

328
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,000
bothered to watch

329
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,680
because you have to explain to me because uh...

330
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,480
i've ever found tom green funny i don't know if it's just me but

331
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,920
he masturbates a horse

332
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,600
so that i could do it but i can do it but i can do it

333
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,520
really a comedy

334
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,040
but anyway that site that I just linked in the chat room

335
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,720
there are screen captures of a... see look, there's the mayor

336
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,960
and there's the free component. I swear to god I had one where the chick was squatting

337
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,400
and then out comes baby

338
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,560
that is not what happened to me. It's a hit and I got an Easter egg

339
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:26,080
boy was it, boy was it ever an egg

340
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,560
okay chat room look at this, does that look

341
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,520
like the mayor is giving birth? No.

342
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,920
it's a vicious lie that's photoshopped

343
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:39,420
Although, one thing that's in here that makes me a little bit wondering, is there's a picture of the horse walking on a path.

344
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:44,420
That's the one, okay, there's, uh, the exercises you can do to the horse, there's one where you can rest it.

345
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:51,420
The item all the way on the right is just, like, rest your horse, and it goes on a trot through the forest, and it's like, your horse is relaxing.

346
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,420
So where'd you get attacked by a bear and dies?

347
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,420
Hey!

348
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,420
Now that would be cool!

349
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,420
Is it true that there's a Derby Owners Club 2 coming out?

350
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,920
Um, yeah, let me find the site again. Someone hold the microphone.

351
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,600
okay

352
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,520
hi any else you ever played to be on the track

353
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,160
nobody else

354
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,680
i have four horses

355
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,200
i've got

356
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,740
is doing

357
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,200
i got uh... i have a horse called mister stanky

358
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,980
uh... i know to be a

359
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,320
character from the era easy

360
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,920
uh... that one called big black

361
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,240
which was that

362
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:30,840
it was a inside joke on the show so uh... i have that and then i've got uh...

363
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,680
one called uh...

364
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,640
and i've got one

365
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,580
i've got one called cloud

366
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,360
and that was the uh...

367
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,340
that was the one i stole from the little girl

368
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,100
and then uh...

369
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,320
uh... was it

370
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:50,240
loki is not lying he did steal that card from a little girl

371
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,640
she had another one too

372
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,920
i can't was called

373
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,820
that's why all the kids run across the panels

374
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:01,820
They're just stupid, those kids, but I'll go into them later.

375
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,940
Okay.

376
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,400
I want to talk about what pissed me off yesterday, though.

377
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,000
This kind of goes into that view of the week, but not really.

378
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,220
Because this is video game related. Okay.

379
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,380
The Derby Owners Club,

380
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,620
the way it works is you have one giant monitor,

381
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,020
and there's eight little stations that you can sit at to play, so theoretically eight

382
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,620
people can play the game at once.

383
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:24,100
And if you visited the website that was given out in the chatroom, you saw a picture, so you know what I'm talking about.

384
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,260
Well, at Milpitas Golf Land on a Saturday, it's pretty busy, so there's a lot of people

385
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,940
that kind of want to play, and it's kind of full.

386
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,220
Well, you know, so I'm sitting there kind of waiting, I'm waiting for a game, and there's

387
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:37,320
freaking people just sitting there at the stations not doing anything, and they're just

388
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,680
like, they just have all their crap there, and they're dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, and like,

389
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,700
you can try and like, wave at them, you know, go, hi, I want to play, and they just totally

390
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,700
ignore you.

391
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,700
They're totally oblivious to you.

392
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,460
Some of the people there were actually waiting on particular races.

393
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,260
And see, I think that, personally, I think that's bullshit.

394
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:58,260
If you're going to do that, where you're just going to sit on the game and wait for particular races, you need to do that on weeknight when no one's there.

395
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:03,260
You need not do that on the middle of a Saturday. So, poo on you, you derby squatters.

396
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:08,260
I guess that's happened to me with Initial D before.

397
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:17,260
It's the difference between having two, where there's big lines of people, and then one with eight terminals, and people are just sitting there.

398
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,260
There's a difference between Initial D and Derby Owners Club.

399
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,260
You haven't even played the horsey guy.

400
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,260
Ooh, you got admonished, Mr. Loki.

401
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:49,260
Ninja Usagi-Koi says bad stealing from kids.

402
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,260
Ninja Usagi-Koi.

403
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:56,260
Well, I didn't technically steal it. She was dumb and left it there, so I took it.

404
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:00,260
Okay, taking advantage of other people's stupidity is okay.

405
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:05,260
Should we actually try to have FUs of the week?

406
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:09,260
Loki wanted to actually talk about something Bamani, so I'm going to figure I'll give him...

407
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:15,260
I'm going to give them a chance to present a Bomani-related topic, and we'll all talk about it and see how long that lasts.

408
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,260
Have fun.

409
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:22,260
Alright. Well, obviously, there's Poppy Music 8 is coming out for the home version.

410
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,260
Hey, there's people that play Poppy Music, so shut the hell up.

411
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,260
Yeah, I play Poppy Music 8.

412
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:38,260
Okay, Poppy Music 8 is coming out, and it's going to be, they've estimated that it's going to have over 100 songs on it, plus a new mode that's called Live Mode, which has something to do with these live videos of them playing.

413
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:43,340
I don't know what the fuck it is. I don't play pop music. I played it once and I didn't like it, so there.

414
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,700
Yeah, great. Where's 2DX7's style?

415
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:52,700
Why do they keep cranking out the pop music? Hello! 2DX7's style has already been announced.

416
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,620
When? When? I thought it was coming out in April.

417
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,900
I think that's just a rumor. Whatever.

418
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,380
We're going to research this a little bit.

419
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:06,700
You know, I should really pay attention to all this news since I read it all the time.

420
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,720
pop music it's okay i mean i like it it's cool and i think backing reason a

421
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,260
lot of people like it a lot seriously is because

422
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,560
they don't have it many places so like having played it is like a special club

423
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,560
like your leader if you play pop music or whatever

424
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,340
problem is is going on and i have some good tunes makes me freaking hands hurt

425
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,780
my politics rebel

426
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,640
aerobics revolution

427
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,400
uh... land and next year for the uh...

428
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,160
the japanese home version max to

429
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,640
oh i'm sorry i'm sorry uh... matt the uh... ice princess has a question arms

430
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,600
and ice queen

431
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,120
all that you have to speak in the mike signal

432
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,160
all right so why don't you go ahead and enlighten all of us idiots out here who

433
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,320
don't know what the hell you're talking about when you talk about pop music

434
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,560
i'll let you do it

435
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,040
music like to the x

436
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,940
we have big buttons around

437
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,360
you know it's not like this you've got the uh... buttons big round buttons

438
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,340
and you just

439
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:05,680
and yelling trouble yes it's like non problematic bubbles to get into music

440
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,680
That's an excellent way of describing it. Thank you, Bombay.

441
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:14,680
It's almost like if you were to take 2DX and turn it into a Saturday morning cartoon, that's what it would be.

442
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,680
It's all nice and stuff, but it's still kind of difficult like 2DX.

443
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:23,680
And they have pop and stage, which looks like pump it up with buttons.

444
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,680
But yeah, pop and music is pretty popular.

445
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,680
They have a pretty good selection of music.

446
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,680
I mean, hello, Daikin and Ty. That's a really popular song on DDR Extreme and stuff.

447
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,680
and people are like, oh, hey, whoa, there's actual good music in there?

448
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,680
Overplay!

449
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,680
Yeah.

450
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But still, there's a lot of stuff on pop music that no one's really heard of.

451
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,680
I mean, pop music even has a Star Trek theme. Hello, that's pretty funny.

452
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:53,680
But yeah, that's pretty much what it is.

453
00:26:53,680 --> 00:27:00,680
It's like 2DX, they've got some weird shit, weird modifiers on there and stuff, but it's pretty much like 2DX.

454
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,960
And it's more like happy and rainbowy and gay because like the buttons are these big

455
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,960
right yeah I knew that would make you cheer.

456
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,800
Yeah it's got these big like red and yellow and blue and green buttons and they all flash

457
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,560
and little things that fall it's falling pancakes that's what they look like they're big falling

458
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,260
pancakes that have big eyes on them they go hi meet me and then you hit the button when

459
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:22,280
they hit the blind and they go oh excellent.

460
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,640
But like sometimes you have to hit four buttons at once so you're playing the game like this

461
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,280
with your elbows.

462
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,280
Well, that's good radio. No one can see that.

463
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,280
I know. Okay.

464
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,280
You all did, though. Imagine...

465
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,280
Imagine doing the Tran dance in the stoic video.

466
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,280
That's kind of like what playing some popin' music is.

467
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,280
Anyways...

468
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,280
And the only place I know of anywhere that has popin' music...

469
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,280
I think they have a machine in Portland.

470
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,280
Yes, Bombay.

471
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,280
Yeah, I found one in Orange County, actually.

472
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,280
At Camelot Golf Land.

473
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,280
And...

474
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,280
Oh, I'll be damned!

475
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,280
In Orange County.

476
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,280
That's the one near Disneyland.

477
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,280
Camelot.

478
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,280
Yeah, CMGO.

479
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,280
It's pretty tight.

480
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,280
I didn't get a chance to play.

481
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,600
There was actually a lot of people playing, so.

482
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,120
And then, of course, AI has one.

483
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,280
They have Pop Music 9, which I did get to play when I was down there.

484
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,280
Well, yeah.

485
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,600
When we went down there, they had that shitty M-whatever-that-is-stupid anime low.

486
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,600
See, now that's one of Jamie's favorites.

487
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,240
That one sucked ass.

488
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,120
If you like anime, it's gonna have all the songs you like in it.

489
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,080
Mambo Go-Go was, like, better than that.

490
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,080
Leave me alone.

491
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:35,920
I can't pronounce shit tonight, leave me alone.

492
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,640
But uh, yeah, um, let's see here.

493
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,480
Other than that, you know, just like, it's just a lot of home versions coming out, pretty

494
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,280
much everyone's waiting for Max 2 to come out, as uh, we talked about that a little

495
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,000
bit last week, and then there's Aerobics Revolution.

496
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I'm so moist from excitement about Max 2.

497
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
That no one gives a shit about.

498
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Have they figured out if there's going to be anything special in it yet?

499
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Have they announced any features or anything like that?

500
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
They announced how many songs they're supposed to be.

501
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
How many? How many?

502
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I don't remember!

503
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
It's like 60 or 70.

504
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
You're fired.

505
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
You don't do anything.

506
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Loki, you're supposed to remember these things.

507
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Yeah, when I'm busy running a couple sites and doing shit for my work.

508
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Listen, my job on this show is to be cute, and I fulfill that.

509
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
So, what's your job? Bring us news.

510
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Are you bringing us news?

511
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,340
fuck

512
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,640
that's messed up man

513
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:31,640
you're bringing us like half the news you're like msnbc jesus

514
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,800
okay

515
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,680
no on microsoft no

516
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,560
try think

517
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:44,480
i don't really know much about that and i have like gossip news okay

518
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,140
as reported on the air mania acts in one of their like random topic things

519
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:49,980
money ruler

520
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:56,980
backgrounds, he didn't make them. He stole them. Gossip! Oh my god! So who did? Who cares?

521
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,180
Who did? Who did? He just got them off some sites. It doesn't really matter. So like he

522
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:07,400
downloaded the artwork and just added the text or what? Yeah, pretty much. That doesn't

523
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,560
make sense though, because like, a lot of the backgrounds, at least the ones I saw had

524
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,520
some really elaborate text to them, so it's not like somebody just went and laid down

525
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:26,520
I've never been to, like, um, there's a bunch of art sites out there that people do, um, you know, the digital cultures or whatever like that, but, um, ooh.

526
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:35,520
So, um, yeah, but who really gives a shit? I mean, I thought, I thought you didn't, I thought for whatever reason you had a grudge against him or something and you, you would have liked that news.

527
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,520
I don't have a grudge against him.

528
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,520
I do not have a grudge against him!

529
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,520
The only thing I was saying was that his step files are too hard.

530
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,520
You cannot possibly play them on the feet.

531
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,520
I mean, try playing stoic on a pad that's like...

532
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,520
Hot living is not a ham.

533
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,520
You're hot living, whatever.

534
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,520
No, I'm just talking...

535
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,520
It's just...

536
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,520
I don't know, his stuff's hard.

537
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,520
I don't like it. Everyone calls it four-key beatmania.

538
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,520
Yeah, I'd say that's pretty accurate.

539
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,520
But, um...

540
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:09,520
So wait, how do you get news like that? So a site actually ran a news story saying,

541
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,520
guess what? Actually it was a forum post, so...

542
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:17,520
Oh, it was a forum post. I thought it was like front page. I'm like, that's pretty sad.

543
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,520
You know it's a slow news day when the front page news is, uh-uh, bitch didn't do his own art.

544
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:29,520
Who gives a shit anyways? It's like, art isn't really a big- well yeah, it makes your file look nice,

545
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,020
It has nothing to do with the steps at all.

546
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,020
And I think the only thing was just because he's...

547
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:37,520
Maybe, okay, maybe because Turnimix, they insisted that you make your own backgrounds, right?

548
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,520
And didn't he, wasn't he a judge for that?

549
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,520
I don't know.

550
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:46,020
Well, he was a judge in the last one, but whatever.

551
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:52,520
Well, I invite him for an interview on this show to clear the air, if he or any of his cohorts are listening.

552
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:58,020
I don't really even know what half the story is, because obviously I'm only reporting half the story since that's what she said.

553
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:02,100
I don't even know I just think I think he might have been claiming that he did all the artwork

554
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:06,020
Instead of just saying hey, I got this from here. I had the text done

555
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:10,940
I mean if that's if he just came forward and said that everything would be fine. That's all this but

556
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:16,580
Yeah, it was really fucking slow as far as nudes goes. There's nothing. You know what I want him on the show

557
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:20,580
How can we make that happen? I want to get him on the show and have him explain what happened

558
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:25,720
That's never gonna happen. So isn't that your job, you know getting guests on the show. I'll see what I can do

559
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,720
I thought we were going to fucking happen.

560
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,720
It doesn't matter.

561
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,720
Who cares?

562
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,720
So what's coming up?

563
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,720
What's 4.15?

564
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:45,720
According to Bi-Rite, I beat many of CDX7's styles coming out on April 15th of 2003.

565
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,720
But Bi-Rite is a shitty ass place to order games from anyway.

566
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,720
Because they cheated me with my Tekken 4 and they suck and need to die.

567
00:32:53,720 --> 00:33:00,280
Bitter are we? Bitter? Party of one? Your table's ready? Bitter?

568
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,240
I don't bite my ass. But, I mean,

569
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:09,440
I don't know, if anyone can find any, if anyone can look on Konami's

570
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,020
Japanese site and find me proof that they have something up for BeatMania

571
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,600
TDX7 style to be out and

572
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,160
on home or from any reliable place, send me a PM in the chat room, please.

573
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,160
DarkSakuraSSX

574
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,920
uh... you know you'd be surprised like uh...

575
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,280
all the stuff that i do during the week is that basically my job for those who don't

576
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,000
know i'm entering phones and

577
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,540
talking to people and i have my

578
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:04,960
i have my internet explorer open all the time you know browsing web pages because we're on T1 and i

579
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,800
download about five hundred megs worth of files every

580
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,300
every week and you know so

581
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,120
that's what i do all day so i read about eight

582
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,940
forums at the same time

583
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,260
all day long

584
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,300
and uh...

585
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:25,600
You'd think that I would know more what's going on, but really, to be honest, for the last three months, there has been nothing going on in the news.

586
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:30,400
It's like, our show's just been just kinda like, okay, just find some new shit to talk about.

587
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,900
Ah, nothing there.

588
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:44,900
So, there really isn't that much going on right now, other than waiting for the home version of Maxu to come, which is probably gonna have, you know, the same rehash shit from DDR, you know, Max USA, which, you know, some of those songs.

589
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:50,900
But at least we'll be able to make edits for it and maybe a few new songs for Extreme 2 and whatnot.

590
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:58,900
And then, obviously, probably later on this year, we'll have some news about DDR Extreme 2 and its development and all that stuff.

591
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:09,900
And then, you know, that kind of stuff. But right now, there's not too much. New Guitar Freaks, obviously, is being, I think, playtested right now.

592
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:15,900
I want it to be available somewhere else besides like where you know it will go.

593
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:21,900
Let's talk about Mocap Golf because we just got to NDS and that game looks really fun.

594
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:32,900
Before we get on the Mocap Golf tangent I just wanted to say I'm looking at BamaniX.com and they have 2DX 7th style coming out in August for the PS2.

595
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:41,900
So take that will. However, they say that BeatMe is seventh mix plus the finals coming on PS2 and March, but I haven't heard anything about that yet seeing as, hmm, it's March.

596
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,900
Uh, yeah, it's kind of surprising.

597
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,900
My memory serves me right. I think it was the 24th or 25th.

598
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:52,900
Yeah, I thought I heard that was going to be late March. Yeah, like last week.

599
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:57,900
Well, gee, Konami of Japan's doing a great job promoting it.

600
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,900
Well, they do a great job with everything. Like, you know.

601
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:05,900
Now wasn't it supposed to come out, oh I don't know, Christmas Eve last year?

602
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:11,900
Well, if I remember right, what they said about Christmas Eve was that that was just supposed to be 7th mix for the PS1.

603
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,900
And now they're doing 7th mix plus the final PS2, whatever.

604
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,900
Eh, who cares? Can we get on to boat camp golf now?

605
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,900
And like an open layer to like, frickin', um, Konami.

606
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,900
Why are you ignoring Dead End?

607
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,900
I mean that song back in 3rd mix is a pretty cool song, you haven't remixed it at all.

608
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:33,220
remix it at all. You've like, remixed the hell out of Trip Machine and Paranoia and

609
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,020
all this be brilliant to you and shit.

610
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,820
I wanna see Dead End in 2DX.

611
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,460
Yeah.

612
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,380
That would be kinda cool.

613
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,420
Alright, Mocap Golf.

614
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,400
Okay, Mocap Golf, yes.

615
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,820
Greatest motion capture game ever.

616
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,900
It is so cool.

617
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,020
It is damn cool, don't say that.

618
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:56,840
It frickin' rules. Dude, what other game can you hit a golf ball off the top of a

619
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,940
building

620
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,920
onto another one

621
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,440
you'd give a microphone second picture

622
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,680
the only reason it's the only reason i'm mad is because

623
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,480
over at skidio we're supposed to have so colorado already but instead i went

624
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,980
into work today and saw a golf game

625
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,880
now that we will have a bad

626
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,640
i think a lot of other so far she's been out for a while i think i know about

627
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,360
i'm waiting for it like

628
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,520
so he has really

629
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,980
awesome system for it and I'm really excited about it, but he just needs the software.

630
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:34,720
Okay, yes, broaden your horizons, that's all I need to say. Golf, man, golf!

631
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:39,000
I like Soulcalibur, but I don't know, I tend to want to play other things now.

632
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,400
You know what game? It's not Golf's Better, it's just Good.

633
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,920
It needs a goodie. The sword game?

634
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,440
It was called in America, Blade of Honor or something.

635
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,440
You can play it in, like, different sword styles and everything, too.

636
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,440
That would be cool.

637
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,440
And, like, you can cut people in half.

638
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,440
And I played it in, um, in Vegas.

639
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,440
Vegas?

640
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,440
Because they actually had the, uh, it's a goodie one.

641
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,440
It was at New York, New York.

642
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,440
I am going there.

643
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:09,440
But, I, I, I paid four bucks, no, two dollars, four bucks, actually,

644
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,440
to play that game and have a replay.

645
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,440
Because it's Vegas.

646
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,440
No one can hear what you're saying, by the way.

647
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:21,440
I played it in Orange County and there was only 8 nickels.

648
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,440
Well, there, but I was in Vegas and everything cost more in Vegas.

649
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,440
That was the only place I had ever seen it.

650
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,440
But that game takes mocap golf, bends it over, and says,

651
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,440
Hey, here's a sword. Guess where it is?

652
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,440
Yeah, but usually golf clubs are longer than swords.

653
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,440
Swords hurt more.

654
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,440
They're sharper.

655
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,440
Have you ever been hit with a golf ball before?

656
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,440
Have you ever been anally raped by a sword?

657
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,440
Have you?

658
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,440
I read a lot.

659
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,440
That's all you can come up with? Have you?

660
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,440
Yes, that's all I can come up with right now.

661
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,440
This is like another Dave over here.

662
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,440
I'm like open all night.

663
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,440
Yeah, he's like CCL Dave.

664
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,440
Lightning Dave. I will just OB on the attack all night.

665
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,440
I'm just kidding.

666
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,440
cap golf

667
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,920
and you can play on the beach

668
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,480
and for the record by the way i have been hit with a golf ball in the neck

669
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,320
so yeah

670
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,120
where at

671
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,460
i mean no not

672
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:27,920
no where is it where is it someone actually hit it

673
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,760
no she threw it at herself into my neck

674
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:38,120
at themselves in the throat kind of an idiot are you

675
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,120
I'm gonna throw the phone at myself!

676
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,120
Oh!

677
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,120
I'm so mad!

678
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,120
That sounds so likey-dokey.

679
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:50,120
Rob's drinking nuclear waste.

680
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,120
It's this stuff that, um...

681
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,120
Oh.

682
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:56,120
This green drink that I'm drinking is Hawaiian Punch Green Blaster.

683
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,120
What's it called?

684
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,120
Something.

685
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,120
It's like...

686
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,120
Hawaiian Punch Greenship flavor.

687
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,120
But they used to, um...

688
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:05,120
I think they only had it in SoCal and now they have it at the Rob's by my house.

689
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,120
Yes.

690
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,120
It's very nice.

691
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,840
And like, I blame Melody for getting me hooked to that.

692
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,560
I'm gonna share my accomplishment with everyone on the radio here.

693
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,000
I am nine days without soda. I haven't had a soda in nine days, so...

694
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,280
Who's running a 12-step program? Soda drinkers are not a mess.

695
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,280
She crack open a Pepsi. Fuck off.

696
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,000
So yeah, I...

697
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,800
And then now, this is a big deal for me because I usually

698
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,200
have a Mountain Dew in the morning just to wake up, and then like, you know,

699
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:38,800
I drink like three vanilla cokes when I get home. So it's a pretty big deal. So of course Hawaiian punch

700
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,020
Really isn't that much better for you than soda, but you know, so it's a special day

701
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,360
You know, you know what it's a special day so eat shit

702
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,640
Okay, so

703
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,120
Should we should we take a break for a minute?

704
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,800
Should we take a break for a minute? You want to do the f-use when we come back?

705
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:06,640
Sure, prepare yourself for the FUs that are coming up when we get back.

706
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,940
If you would like to submit an FU, remember, tonight we're at Jamie's, so don't send them

707
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,940
to me.

708
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,240
You'll see my name in the chat room says I'm out, out in the boot.

709
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,460
So you want to send them to Jamie.

710
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:20,920
Her nickname is DarkSakuraSSF, so send your FUs of the week to Jamie.

711
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,360
And we'll try to keep it short this week, we promise.

712
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,360
Everybody in the room is going to keep them short tonight, yes?

713
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,200
FUs will be short tonight, yes?

714
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:34,920
no all right so some short f-use night okay so we'll be back in a little bit

715
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:40,240

718
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,000
click on chat that URL is a little hard to remember I got a much easier one for

719
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,880
you to remember just go to Cali Bamani calm c-a-l-i Bamani calm and we're an

720
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:03,880
the affiliate of callebomani.com, so they got a link right there on the front page to the radio station.

721
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:09,880
You should do a TK, uh, like, uh, register a TK, um, you know, one of those.

722
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,880
No.

723
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,880
FINE!

724
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,880
.coms are better!

725
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,880
Yeah, but they cost money!

726
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:22,880
Actually, yeah, when I get a little more money, I'm gonna purchase a.org on behalf of the station, sir,.com or.org, so we'll be at Orange Lounge Radio or Orange Lounge.

727
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,880
How about.tv? Because all the good websites have.tv.

728
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,160
and then we could say as seen on t-v even though you know we've never been on

729
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,180
t-v well i i was on t-v for understation live

730
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:35,340
and dark dark by jamie's name was in the chat room

731
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,220
so i want to do i

732
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,160
take our recordings of the show

733
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:43,140
actually broadcast among public access radio

734
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:46,860

735
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:47,980

right sensor out there with her

737
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:57,120
If they sent you this show, there'd be like three episodes worth of time.

738
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:01,120
Shit, fuck, damn, cock, pussy.

739
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,120
Cut!

740
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:08,120
That's my favorite. Little known fact, I actually was a public access celebrity.

741
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,120
Beep!

742
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,120

743
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,120
Okay, we're going to break.

744
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,120

But we can do it now, you're such a fangirl scholar

759
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,120
You can't do a race to take that fall

760
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,120
And it's up to you to make that call

761
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,120

You can't drop that ball

763
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,120
You can't drop that ball

764
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,120
They dropped their ball!

765
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,120

Well it's time to take a man and watch him back

774
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:35,120
I'm gonna kick your ass and beat him, kill him all

775
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:41,120
Down, what am I gonna do?

776
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:47,120
Have you ever think of a game like this?

777
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,120
I know it here

778
00:49:49,120 --> 00:50:00,120
Oh, ass!

779
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:06,520
This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

780
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,080
I'm eating a taquito.

781
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:11,080
We are eating taquitos.

782
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,080
Taquitos!

783
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,880
I love taquitos.

784
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,520
The official food of Orange Lounge?

785
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,160
I don't know.

786
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:21,140
thank you uh... ice cream for getting to get to keep us there delicious

787
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:23,520
i hate them good

788
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,240
that like me

789
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,640
doesn't make you poop

790
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:31,720
now i just don't like that

791
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:35,280
their food sucks ass that's what i have against it

792
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,020
but but uh...

793
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:39,520
look you forgot the water too

794
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,380
but i'm pleasantly surprised that uh... what was it uh...

795
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,240
chevy's they have

796
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,400
hot wings

797
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:52,000
and they were damn good. That was the only thing I ate last night at Chevy's. Chevy's was damn good fajitas because they had that cornmeal stuff.

798
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:59,200
For me, I'm allergic to corn, but I will eat that cornmeal stuff like all day. I had them give me an extra thing of it and I did nothing to eat that cornmeal one day.

799
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:06,200
Um, Amanda, one of the official lesbians of Orange Launch Radio who was here a couple weeks ago, we were at Chevy's the other day and she kept threatening to tell them it was my birthday.

800
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:11,600
And that got me to thinking, you know, how would the restaurants know? Like, you know, if you go in there every time you eat and tell them it's your birthday,

801
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,600
They'd never know, huh? And you can get, like, free ice cream!

802
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,600
Well, okay, as long as you didn't go to the same Chevy's every week, okay?

803
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,600
Then they'd probably catch on. But you know, if you go a different...

804
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,600
Well, then again, they'd probably, like, keep track of it.

805
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,600
They'd, like, take pictures of you, like...

806
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,600
They don't take pictures! Have you ever seen them snap a camera as they're singing Happy Birthday?

807
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,600
No, they put the sombrero on your head, sing their verse, they leave.

808
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,600
If you don't tip them, then they'll still not know who you are.

809
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:42,600
That's the thing we should do, just like, send you out to as many places and see how many places you get a birthday at a day.

810
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,600
For like a week, and just see what you can do.

811
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,600
Okay, okay, we can do it.

812
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,600
See how well you can pull that off.

813
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,600
You're the intern though, you have to do the embarrassing stuff. We'll tell them it's your birthday.

814
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,600
I have to do the embarrassing stuff? Oh, thank you.

815
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:55,600
See, I love my birthday-

816
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,600
And then we'll give me the ice cream.

817
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:02,600
My birthday kicks ass because I get to be cheerful and everyone's like so sad.

818
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:08,600
I love it. That was the best gift anyone could give me was the death of thousands and thousands of people on my birthday.

819
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:20,600
Let's see. Unpolitically correct statement took less than an hour this time into the show. Congratulations.

820
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,600
I think we should get to the fuck yous of the week, right?

821
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,600
Yeah, sure.

822
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:31,600
Okay, um, well we don't have, we can't play music in the background because my mixer sucks and I need a new sound card.

823
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,600
Anyone wants to give me a new sound card? Thank you.

824
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:38,600
Anyway, first fuck you of the week goes to my sound card.

825
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:43,600
I'm sorry, tack you ain't. Okay.

826
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:47,600
This is fucked up.

827
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:52,600
Um, also goes toward having no money right now because I'm paying for my car.

828
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:55,320
Also it goes toward um

829
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:02,600
Not being able to go by myself like more socks because I have this a natural sock collection

830
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:08,840
My socks look like a big pink of like barcode anyway

831
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,800
Said you were two dollars and thirty seven cents

832
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,160
Okay, I actually only have eleven dollars

833
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:25,160
Um, thank you to bandwidth, and I really am not angsty about much of anything else.

834
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,160
Cool.

835
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,160
Thank you to work tomorrow, I don't want to go.

836
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,160
Next.

837
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,160
Oh, no.

838
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:40,200
Um, let's see, um, my FUs of the week are, um, FU to those people that squat on Derby

839
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:46,640
Owners Club, that sucks, FU to gas prices, oh my god, even the cheap shit's two bucks

840
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:51,240
a gallon

841
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:54,880
what else do i want to say if you too

842
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,100
and uh...

843
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,400
i don't know if you to uh...

844
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:04,360
the fact that i haven't got laid six months that sucks

845
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,560
loki stern

846
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:10,720
cuz we're all keeping quick tonight i a m

847
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,040
let's see well if you see bill kids

848
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,400
just everywhere

849
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,400
still mother young

850
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,600
Effie, there's a stupid, slow-ass van that was in front of me on my way here.

851
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:24,920
I understand that you like going 25 miles an hour in a 35, and the fact that all the

852
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:31,040
people in your van are disabled, probably blind or deaf or something, you know, seriously,

853
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:35,960
if I had any sort of, you know, rocker-propelled explosive, that van would be gone.

854
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:41,120
And you know, I almost attempted to push him into traffic because I figured, you know,

855
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,440
who's going to miss them?

856
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,440
No one's going to miss them.

857
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,880
So Effie, either that.

858
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:53,500
And F.E. to my site for being stupid because FTP went link right and that sucked because

859
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:56,160
all the files are down for like all day.

860
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,920
But I fixed that and that was cool.

861
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:03,880
And F.E. to me for having so much work because I'm like busy all the time and I can't enjoy

862
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:04,880
anything.

863
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,240
Just work, work, work, work, work.

864
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:12,040
And oh, F.E. to gas prices because they suck.

865
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:15,780
I just know because all the gas station tenants are just gels that were bombing their country.

866
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:20,620
So uh, that's it, I'm done.

867
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:21,620
Oh my god.

868
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:25,300
Alright, I only got a few FUs.

869
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:29,060
One is to those people who get on the bus in the wheelchairs but manage to get up and

870
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:31,220
walk when they get off the bus.

871
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:35,220
I always wondered like to slow these people who just look absolutely normal, if you push

872
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:39,460
them out to traffic I bet you anything they would get up and run.

873
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:43,580
They would leave the wheelchair at the middle of the road and get up and fucking run.

874
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:46,340
Another one is to my lack of concentration.

875
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:52,540
Today I almost full comboed Can't Stop Falling in Love on Light 7 on 2DX and I missed the

876
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:59,340
last fucking note and so I almost killed the machine as I jumped up in circles.

877
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:03,980
Another one is the little bastards over at Scandia, the little kids who just think it's

878
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:07,980
a really good idea to try to get in your way when you're playing 2DX, you just want to

879
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:09,820
reach over and kick them.

880
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:14,820
Yeah, that's pretty much about it, because I haven't had much of a week.

881
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:17,820
Fuck you to dead people, because it sucks.

882
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:20,820
What? No, I have a mic.

883
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:29,820
Fuck you to the assholes that were getting in my way while I was trying to pass Dyken Kai Light yesterday at Country Club Lanes.

884
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:32,820
You couldn't pass it anyway. Xam's deaths are gay.

885
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,820
No, I know, but still...

886
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:38,820
They're getting in my way, getting on the machine, and giving me shit.

887
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:42,820
Fuckin' A, man.

888
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:45,820
What were they doing? Were they standing between you and the machine going,

889
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:46,820
What are you doing? What are you doing?

890
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,820
No, they're stepping on the arrows.

891
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:50,820
She just stepped on their foot.

892
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:51,820
I was.

893
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:52,820
With spiked heels.

894
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:54,820
I know. I need to...

895
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:56,820
I know you own a pair.

896
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:59,820
Definitely. Cleats, indeed, yes.

897
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:13,820
You know, one of these days on the show, I'm just going to be myself and be nice. Seriously. Because I'm like a really nice person. I mean, I'm a really nice person. I just have weird strangers.

898
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:14,820
Really?

899
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:19,820
I am nice. You guys have all made me out to be like this crazy racist guy.

900
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:21,820
I'm not that person.

901
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,820
What did you get for hanging out with Rob?

902
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:27,820
I love everybody except the disabled and stupid people.

903
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:32,820
That would have fallen under stupid people.

904
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,820
Actually, disabled people are cool if they're smart.

905
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:39,820
It's just the stupid people I hate. I hate stupid people all about.

906
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:41,820
I hate humanity.

907
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:14,300

00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:17,820

00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:59,120
we need to take a moment so we can let some very special people say hi

935
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:02,480

my life's been good

941
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:17,260
So your life's good so you can't say hi to us anymore?

942
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:20,260
I'm just so excited!

943
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:24,260
I don't know, I've been poking around Scandia lately after work, but I get off work at 1.30, so...

944
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:25,260
Oh, poopy.

945
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:27,260
So nobody gets to see me over there myself.

946
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:29,260
You're just a mystery now.

947
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:30,260
I am?

948
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,260
Well, I mean, you know, because we don't see you.

949
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:33,260
Oh, I'm sorry.

950
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:35,260
You know what, I've really gone down in skill, too.

951
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:39,260
I mean, I was doing just a standard little one, and then all of a sudden my legs stopped working.

952
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,260
Me too, and I've gotten fat, see?

953
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:43,260
Uh-huh.

954
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:47,020
you're expecting to yeah i don't know so what what do you want to take all the

955
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:50,660
listeners the worldwide listeners of orange lounge radio

956
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:53,520
play lots of the d r and try to lose your belly

957
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:58,900
for god's sake you're embarrassing yourself

958
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:02,440
we want to talk about embarrassing yourselves and we saw the guy today holy

959
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,240
crap

960
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:06,520
did he suck asset freestyle

961
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:10,120
and he's just like getting up on their doubles he had no sense of you know

962
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:14,280
coordination, balance, rhythm, or anything. I don't even know why he's... I don't even

963
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,360
know how he's able to do doubles to begin with.

964
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:17,200
Robin, I don't know anything about that.

965
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:21,920
He was just up there, like, doing his thing, like, holding the bar, and he, he tried jumping...

966
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:27,800
Okay, first he started off his first stomp, plain, light, uh, little, with no freeze arrows,

967
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:33,880
and he jumped up over the bar, totally off cue, and totally missed the first step, nearly,

968
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:36,280
like, broke his ankle. It was hilarious.

969
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:36,800
Woo-hoo!

970
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,360
Bye!

971
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:37,880
Bye!

972
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:38,880
Bye!

973
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:39,880
Bye!

974
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:42,680
Did you ever get to do your FUs, Nita?

975
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:43,680
Too much chaos.

976
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,000
Um, I didn't really have an FU.

977
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,800
Why are all the women nice today except Jamie?

978
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:48,800
Jamie's always mean, though.

979
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:49,800
We expect that of her.

980
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:50,800
Yeah.

981
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,800
My week's been going okay, so I guess I don't really have an FU.

982
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:53,800
Oh.

983
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:54,800
So...

984
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,800
I mean, all of this is made of furniture.

985
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:57,800
Yes, okay.

986
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:01,720
Furniture made by what we assume to be communists.

987
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,280
Dude, it sucked.

988
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,960
It took like four hours to put a fucking desk together.

989
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,280
Yes, this desk.

990
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:13,480
of all, weighed like 200 pounds just to carry it. Yeah, this is a desk, a wooden desk, a

991
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:18,240
computer desk. Nothing worked right, nothing fit together the way it was supposed to. Oh,

992
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:21,960
and what about the drawer thing you're making now? The drawers don't even fit right. I'm

993
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:27,080
putting together a four dresser drawer that's not like another six million pieces. It sucks.

994
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:30,960
It's communist. So fuck you to furniture that you have to put together. How do you like

995
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,960
It's like my desk, it has all these extra pieces.

996
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,960
You have to put each individual screw together.

997
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:40,960
A lot of screwing going on.

998
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,960
If anybody doesn't know what that's from, watch the clerk's part.

999
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:45,960
It is the best thing ever.

1000
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,960
So that's it. Anybody else have any fuck yous?

1001
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:54,960
Give me microphone.

1002
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:57,960
Time for puppy to bitch.

1003
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:58,960
Bitch.

1004
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,480
Hey, wait a minute.

1005
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,080
Like a bitch is a dog?

1006
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,080
Get it?

1007
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,080
That's funny.

1008
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,080
Haha, yeah.

1009
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,080
Shut up.

1010
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:07,080
Okay.

1011
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:10,320
Damn, why y'all be such a bitch?

1012
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,320
Shit.

1013
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:14,800
I'm gonna catch you.

1014
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,800
Okay.

1015
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:17,800
What the?

1016
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:18,800
Who?

1017
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:19,800
Who the hell?

1018
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,800
Okay.

1019
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:21,800
Okay, look out.

1020
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:25,240
Jamie needs to get through.

1021
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:27,240
Do your ad views, puppy.

1022
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:38,240
First of all, I'd like to give a fuck you to my toilet in my bathroom, because the toilet seat broke a couple days ago, and now I cannot sit on it.

1023
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:41,240
Given the term, I'm going to cut your ass up in a whole new meeting.

1024
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:52,240
Yes, indeed. And then, let's see, fuck the smell of weed, because it stinks, and it doesn't come out of carpeting very well.

1025
01:03:52,240 --> 01:04:01,240
Yes. Because I can smell it in the other room when nobody ever smokes it besides in the room next door. It sucks.

1026
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,240
Ah, to be in a college dorm again.

1027
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:16,240
Yeah. Fuck dorm food, which I no longer call real food. I spell it differently now. I spell it with two u's instead of two o's because it's not worthy of being called real food.

1028
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,240
I think you should use an umlaut.

1029
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:24,240
I could do that, yes, but I was too lazy to try and figure out what key that is.

1030
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:28,240
Alright, now we get to the chat rooms I've used. Has everyone gone?

1031
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:33,240
Okay, first one comes from Japan Man.

1032
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:37,240
Fuck you little kids who get on when he plays Cool 7.

1033
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:40,240
And fuck you to people who don't like my baby mama.

1034
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,240
Agreed.

1035
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:45,240
I think we should play that during the next break.

1036
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:54,240
The next one is from JB, or Justin Circuit, in the name.

1037
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,240
Jenny's bitch.

1038
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:56,240
Yeah, Jenny's bitch.

1039
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:01,240
FU to ATCBI Comcast, they canceled the account due to a server glitch and couldn't get it

1040
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:05,240
on for three days when it did work, emails didn't work, and hasn't gotten two of the

1041
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:09,240
secondary accounts and called customer service 18 times and been on the line with them for

1042
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,240
five hours total.

1043
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,240
You know what?

1044
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,240
There's a solution to that.

1045
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,240
It's called Better Business Bureau.

1046
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:14,240
You should write them.

1047
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:20,120
I have an F.U. for my computer.

1048
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:25,200
F.U. to Microsoft because their Windows XP thinks it wants to try to connect to the

1049
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,960
internet all the time even though I click the

1050
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,360
options that says do not connect to the internet and instead it's like

1051
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:34,160
oh I want to connect to the internet. J.B. by the way talk to me later and I'll let you

1052
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,440
know how you can get them in

1053
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:40,000
in legal trouble with the federal government. Go frivolous lawsuits

1054
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,120
and tell them to suck your dick

1055
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:49,600
Um, John Field says FU'd assholes in his dorm that let the air out of his two rear tires

1056
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:50,960
and forced him to call AAA.

1057
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:51,960
Yes, that sucks.

1058
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,960
Um, next one goes...

1059
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:54,960
Oh, oh, oh!

1060
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,040
Fuck AAA for having such high insurance rates.

1061
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,040
What the fuck is that?

1062
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,040
Yeah, but AAA...

1063
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:04,220
I don't have AAA and my friend's AAA let me unlock my car door when I let my keys in.

1064
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:05,220
That is pretty cool.

1065
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:06,220
But AAA can still blow me.

1066
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:07,220
Okay, next...

1067
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:08,220
Ooh, we need to get through these.

1068
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:09,220
That's California.

1069
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:10,840
Next is Ninja Usagi Koi.

1070
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:14,780
I want to send an F.U. to our mall for not letting us put the DDR machines outside for

1071
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:18,740
a tournament and now all the people are going to die from heat stroke and yeah an F.U. to

1072
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:22,740
her dad and for not letting her hang out with Yogi, dad, love you.

1073
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:27,220
I know that situation about not moving a machine outside for a tournament, yeah.

1074
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:29,700
Oh yes, DVGL.

1075
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:32,940
Yes, I know that situation, I feel ya.

1076
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:36,300
Muheimer, first of all, hello to Darketia.

1077
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:37,820
Hi Muheimer.

1078
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:39,460
Hi, Muheimer.

1079
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:42,140
And so now, fuck this dumbass lifeguard and structure bitch

1081
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:46,540
Smelly cat.

1082
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:49,740
Smelly cat.

1083
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:54,060
She told us she had to go potty three times.

1084
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:55,900
Was it number one or number two?

1085
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:57,620
Yeah, she should have gone in the pool.

1086
01:06:57,620 --> 01:06:59,980
Maybe I'll be swimming in pee.

1087
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:02,080
Fuck that feeling when you have 800 different food

1088
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,500
items in your house and you can't find the one unknown thing

1089
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:05,860
you're craving.

1090
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:13,420

The second activity goes to a DDR Extreme OST for apparently not being released.

1108
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:04,900
They're not going to release it?

1109
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:08,900
It's not going to be out for a while. However, talk to me later.

1113
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:22,900
You know what? For the Alabama ones, they just gave it to us while we were in class.

1114
01:08:22,900 --> 01:08:24,900
There's an exit exam now in high school?

1115
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:27,900
And, like, I got a hundred on it.

1116

Believe it or not, on this show, we're going to talk about Bahmani.

1165
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:38,080
Yes, break time.

01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:41,080

Man, fuck over guys, you're just making yourself look worse, you know?

1177
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:14,640
I mean, everybody's just gonna feel sorry for you.

1178
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:21,640
I do.

1179
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:51,640
Ma ke oishak shikate nusai basu forai shou shou

1180
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:59,640
Tashite nana tona ke oshu de nune nichi okou itte noa

1181
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:05,640
Omejou sukonjou toa senbei tari hunde

1182
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:09,640
Taijou daijou naikou naikou totsukimu

1183
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:44,640
So that I'm feeling all agronomied

1184
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,640
Baby, do you want the juice?

1185
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,640
Baby, do you want it?

1186
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,640
Baby, do you want the juice?

1187
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:05,920
Dad if you want it

1188
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:18,540
Oh, you better, even if it's easy for someone to want to

1189
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:26,620
Oh, you better, even if it's easy for someone to want to

1190
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:33,620
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because Real Radio makes Captain Jack cry.

1191
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:58,660
horrible, too bad about that. Okay, let's hear it again.

1192
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:02,080
First off, fuck driver's training in the poop shoot. I would honestly rather have a duck

1193
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:05,180
shoot down my throat than to have to sit through that boring-ass shit. Everyone in the class

1194
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:08,100
is a total bitch, even the teacher. It's not like if you have a penis in test schools I

1195
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:11,740
hate you. I love special test schools because they're sensitive bad men. Or men bad, I should

1196
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:15,820
say. Respect women because we spit you out our baby holes. Indeed. Fuck driver's training

1197
01:20:15,820 --> 01:20:19,460
only, fuck it so exclusively so that all of my horrible negative energy can be used to

1198
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:24,140
destroy driver's training forever. That fucking school can suck my ass. I haven't slept more

1199
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:33,140
than 4 hours each night this past week and I won't get enough sleep this week. Fuck that bullshit, fuck it up the nosehole. Yes, the nosehole. But you missed the fuckity fuck fuck fuck. That was the best.

1200
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:35,140
Fuck fuckity fuck fuck. Fuck you, you fuckin' fuck.

1201
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:36,140
Yeah.

1202
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:37,140
Alright.

1203
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:38,140
Shit.

1204
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:47,140
So, we wanted to do another, we wanted to do another song really fast, but it's something that Loki has to introduce, and why is that, Mr. Loki?

1205
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:49,140
It's another remix I did.

1206
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:52,140
You know, it's not as good as my last one.

1207
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:54,140
It kinda sucked.

1208
01:20:54,140 --> 01:21:00,140
But, I think the problem was because I ended too fast, because I was trying to get it at about three minutes.

1209
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:05,140
And, um, it kinda just, it builds up slowly and then ends kinda quickly.

1210
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:07,140
So, that's kinda the bad thing.

1211
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:10,140
But anyways, um, it's another remix.

1212
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:14,140
It's called, um, Dark Black Force, the Midnight Angel Mix.

1213
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:21,140
And since you're all such big Loki fanboys and girls, here you go.

1214
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:51,140
It's a long way to go, honey.

1215
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:54,140
I know, but I'm away.

1216
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:56,140
Where are we going?

1217
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:59,140
The dark, black forest.

1218
01:23:56,140 --> 01:24:17,060
That was pretty good.

1219
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:18,300
I was really impressed with that.

1220
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:19,300
That was pretty neat.

1221
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:20,300
It was very subtle.

1222
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:24,860
The modem stream probably doesn't do that justice, because a lot of it's very subtle.

1223
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:53,860
But, as, okay, well we probably should go into Symphon News since this is Symphon News, um, okay, obviously Symphon News, the big news, well for me at least, is Leech from Loki 2.0 has finally, finally, two month delay launched, um, it's got, right now, the initial update had the 2DX DWI project files for 2DX second style through fifth style.

1224
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:59,700
5th style, and so there's about, I'd say about 50-some files up there at the moment. I'm

1225
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:05,700
uploading more probably later this week as I get to work on them. I went ahead and...

1226
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:17,400
Oh, man, it looks ugly on that. Okay, anyways. So, I went ahead and, as promised, exclusive

1227
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:22,380
to Orange Launch Radio, if you're a wonderful listener of the show, you get access to a

1228
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:27,520
special page every week and now I was kind of bad and didn't really hide the

1229
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:31,800
page well enough this time but next time the files will be more hidden but

1230
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:38,340
anyways this page exclusively you guys is gonna be the release of my two remixes

1231
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:45,600
the legend of trance and the dark black forest midnight angel mix and so to

1232
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:52,320
access this page what you want to do is go to my site which is www.willddr.com

1233
01:25:52,320 --> 01:26:00,720
rforfood.net slash leechfromloki and then what you want to do once you get to that and

1234
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:08,640
you want to type in also the special HTML page which is going to be hotmonkeysex.html

1235
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:15,240
and that will bring you up to the wonderful page with my two links for my MP3s.

1236
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:18,480
It's a secret page and what are the special MP3s that they can download this week?

1237
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:24,080
Legend of Trance, which is a remix of the Legend of Max, which is just fucking awesome.

1238
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,960
That's my favorite remix so far.

1239
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:33,280
That's Legend of Trance, Loki versus ZZ, featuring Sun Decade.

1240
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:40,980
Then we have Dark Black Forest, Midnight Angel Mix, Steve Reiner versus Loki, featuring Cenaris.

1241
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:45,000
So those are exclusive remixes to Orange Lounge listeners, and we just posted the link in

1242
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,680
the chat room if you didn't get it.

1243
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:51,680
So go leech away and you can listen to those, but don't listen to them now, wait until after the show, because we need our listeners.

1244
01:26:51,680 --> 01:27:01,680
Yeah, so we'll have, um, well as far as DWI's going, you know, for Legend of Trance, as mentioned on the page, um, thinking about that one for Attorney Mix 4.

1245
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:10,680
So, um, that'll be that one, but Dark Black Forest, Midnight Angel Mix is up for grabs, so. It's just a steady 140 bpm.

1246
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:28,680
Well, speaking of your mixes, how about something that was your choice? How about the cage matches?

1247
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:37,680
I don't have Holic, but it won't play the background because of my stupid sound card. Fuck my sound card!

1248
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:40,280
do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.

1249
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:44,160
You sound like Hee Haw!

1250
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:45,160
Not like Ten.

1251
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:46,160
Ah, maybe Pearl!

1252
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:49,480
And this is Hee Haw!

1253
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:54,440
But no, we're going to go ahead and play, um, basically the way that our cage match

1254
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:59,480
works is each of us picks a song, and one of us will have won the previous week, so

1255
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:02,460
that's the song that should be in rotation right now, but really isn't right now.

1256
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:03,500
It isn't right now.

1257
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:11,500
Well, we'll figure it out. We'll put them both in or something, the last week's winner, unless it wins again, which it may. It may win again, but I don't think it will.

1258
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:20,500
But anyway, you, our chat room, votes over private message whether or not, you know, which one that you think should win.

1259
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:28,500
So, as for right now, I'm closing all of these open windows, even though I'm having a conversation with somebody.

1260
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:35,000
Wait till all of the songs are over and though the we you know much like our lovely friends on American Idol

1261
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,400
We'll give our own opinions of these songs and rate them

1262
01:28:38,040 --> 01:28:43,960
But I don't like it. I think it stunk, but don't let don't let us influence you or better yet. Just let me influence you

1263
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:51,580
Gonna play a clip of last week's winner, right? Yeah, I'll play a decent clip of it because actually I actually have like that three

1264
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:58,580
This is Sasha with Xpander, this is last week's winner.

1265
01:29:21,580 --> 01:29:43,860
That was a little bit of an expander.

1266
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:46,420
Anyway, this is Rob's pick of the week.

1267
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:47,420
You want to tell us about it?

1268
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:48,420
Hi, yeah.

1269
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:49,420
Actually, we should write that song.

1270
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:50,420
It's cool.

1271
01:29:50,420 --> 01:29:51,420
I give it a 7.

1272
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:56,260
weeks usually because we already ranked it last week all right and we said it

1273
01:29:56,260 --> 01:30:00,220
shouldn't win and it did because our chat room hate this okay my song and I

1274
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:03,000
had to kind of come up with this at the last minute this really isn't what I

1275
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,640
would have usually picked I completely forgot that like hi we're moving the

1276
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:10,020
show tonight so I actually have to burn a CD off my song but luckily I have a CD

1277
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:13,660
in my car and this is actually a pretty good song and I got turned on to this

1278
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:18,300
song a couple years ago because I love Drew Barrymore and she was in a movie

1279
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:22,180
called Ever After, and this song was in the trailer, and I love this song, and I think

1280
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:26,340
y'all will dig it too. So, it's a couple years old, but it's still classic. Robert Miles

1281
01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:33,340
with fable.

1282
01:30:56,340 --> 01:31:10,340
Talk to me tenderly, so reality fantasy, we'll melt together only in one thing.

1283
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:17,340
Talk to me, tenderly So reality and disease

1284
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:24,340
We'll match together in one thing

1285
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:51,340
Save our own fun

1286
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:57,340
Save our own fun

1287
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:04,340
Save our own fun

1288
01:34:07,340 --> 01:34:11,340
Save our own fun

1289
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:16,340
Tell me a fable

1290
01:34:16,340 --> 01:34:20,340
Tell me a fable

1291
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:23,340
A fable

1292
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:26,340
A fable

1293
01:34:26,340 --> 01:34:31,340
A fable that will never end

1294
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:35,340
And now I dream

1295
01:34:35,340 --> 01:34:37,340
Dream

1296
01:34:37,340 --> 01:34:42,340
One, two, three

1297
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:14,340
Oh

1298
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:44,340
Oh

1299
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:57,300
That was Robert Miles of Fable.

1300
01:36:57,300 --> 01:36:59,780
The big plop at the end is the best.

1301
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:10,140
As far as my opinion of that song, he's done better, so it gets a six.

1302
01:37:10,140 --> 01:37:14,200
Microphones are going every which way.

1303
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:15,600
The song is alright.

1304
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:18,560
Yeah, like, he could have done better, but, um,

1305
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:20,740
Ever After really sucked ass.

1306
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:21,820
So, uh,

1307
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:23,820
that's gonna affect my decision.

1308
01:37:23,820 --> 01:37:29,540
Um, I'm gonna have to give it a six.

1309
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:32,780
That song rocks and you don't. Ten.

1310
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:37,300
Oh wow, that's a real biased opinion there.

1311
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:40,540
i have a really bad experience with that movie

1312
01:37:40,540 --> 01:37:42,860
care to explain?

1313
01:37:42,860 --> 01:37:45,500
go there with the chick who cheats on you and gets pregnant

1314
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:47,720
that's all i gotta say

1315
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:49,620
seriously? it's about the song not the movie

1316
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:51,960
i know that's why i just said

1317
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:53,280
people tell me to explain

1318
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:54,420
no um...

1319
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:57,360
honestly i really didn't like that song

1320
01:37:57,360 --> 01:37:59,700
so i'll give it like a four

1321
01:37:59,700 --> 01:38:04,780
and that's being really really really nice

1322
01:38:04,780 --> 01:38:09,580
For those people that are listening, Rob's is giving raspberries to Zero right now.

1323
01:38:09,580 --> 01:38:12,540
Many times.

1324
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:16,180
I don't know, I thought it was nice.

1325
01:38:16,180 --> 01:38:17,860
Honestly?

1326
01:38:17,860 --> 01:38:19,660
That song would put me to sleep

1327
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:25,020
if I weren't in here talking to other people right now.

1328
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:28,860
Six. I could probably see it in, like, keyboard mania or something.

1329
01:38:28,860 --> 01:38:34,920
okay i like that song okay so i have a new if you to all you bitches in here

1330
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:41,920
i give that's under ten because that's like my kind of song i like it

1331
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:47,400
i'd have to give it like a nine it's it's a pretty good time i like it back

1332
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:48,280
yet

1333
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:51,960
uh... i'd like any trends just about that

1334
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:52,840
any soft

1335
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:59,840
hard anything

1336
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:03,700
okay i'll say that again i give that's on the nine

1337
01:39:03,700 --> 01:39:04,100
it's not

1338
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:08,260
point think that it's pretty damn good

1339
01:39:08,260 --> 01:39:11,940
all right well i have to give it a second i heard a uh... deejay epic

1340
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:13,700
version that's about like

1341
01:39:13,700 --> 01:39:17,660
that's twice as good as that so i'll do it

1342
01:39:17,660 --> 01:39:21,500
so the average scores and remember i'm not very good at math nine so

1343
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:24,760
uh...

1344
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:27,180
okay

1345
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:29,280
it's my turn now

1346
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:32,920
and i don't know who did this because i downloaded it by accident one day

1347
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:36,920
But this is Link's theme. Heave dance remix. Here you go.

1348
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:48,800
Okay, I know it's not the best and I didn't put it in there with an intention of winning,

1349
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:54,320
but when I first downloaded it, it made me really bouncy and hyper, so I give it a 7.

1350
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:55,320
I'll go ahead.

1351
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:58,920
Um, like when I'm listening to that, I like bounce up and down a lot, and then like I

1352
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:02,240
want to take a really big shit.

1353
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:09,240
So I give it eight rolls of toilet paper.

1354
01:42:32,240 --> 01:42:36,240
We'll put that there. Look, I made a remix! Woohoo! Look at me go!

1355
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:38,240
I got a big bass. Wanna come over?

1356
01:42:41,240 --> 01:42:49,240
So, um, yeah, I'm gonna have to give that, like, a two, and, uh, and Robert Miles' song, well, is better now.

1357
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:57,240
Having, having, having, you know, it's like, it's like if you have the ugly chick and you stand next to her and it makes you look better.

1358
01:42:57,240 --> 01:43:00,240
That's what this song was. This song was the ugly chick.

1359
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:05,240
And the rest of the room roasts and groans with that comment.

1360
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:08,240
Oh, come on. Was it really that bad?

1361
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:10,240
Yes.

1362
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:12,240
Uh, eight.

1363
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:14,240
I...

1364
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:17,240
Oh, come on. Loki can do better than that.

1365
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:19,240
Anyways, uh...

1366
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:21,240
I like it. It's short!

1367
01:43:21,240 --> 01:43:24,240
It's short. That's a good thing about a song. It's short. It doesn't drag out.

1368
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:27,240
I give it an eight and a half.

1369
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:30,780
Okay, so I like the fact that it was bouncy it was bouncy

1370
01:43:30,780 --> 01:43:35,680
So there's a couple of points there and it had links theme which a couple of other points

1371
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:38,240
But other than that, it sucked ass. I'm giving it to

1372
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:42,680
Real real real quick if it's going that fast. How fuck are you gonna dance to that?

1373
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:52,880
I know it's a little fast little too bouncy little too happy happy. I don't think I like it that much

1374
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:59,160
I give it like a seven or a six but I give Loki's commentary a ten. I love that

1375
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:03,940
Okay, I just want to say really fast. So Loki you don't dance to it. You have sex to it

1376
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:11,920
Freaking blow vessel doing that man

1377
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:15,200
hahaha

1378
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:18,880
your god thank god for you people that we don't have video attached to that

1379
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:19,920
don't tell the girls that

1380
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:23,680
pull out the master sword baby yeah

1381
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:26,040
no! oh god bad thought

1382
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:28,760
I thought it was too repetitive I gave it a six

1383
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:31,280
I just don't want to tell Dan that Rob did humping

1384
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:33,680
motions in his chair

1385
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:37,680
you know what I say if the FUs were still going I would say fuck you to all who gave it lower

1386
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:40,200
than at least a seven

1387
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:41,320
if you don't have any like...

1388
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:43,320
Well, the fuck you do over there?

1389
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:44,900
Fuck you, buddy!

1390
01:44:44,900 --> 01:44:49,340
Fuck you too!

1391
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:52,320
Here's an idea, okay? Here's an idea.

1392
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:56,720
I've heard better Final Fantasy remixes, okay? Better Final Fantasy remixes, they

1393
01:44:56,720 --> 01:45:00,760
need to just do a decent remix of it, then we'll give it a decent score.

1394
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:06,680
Alright, well let's just go ahead and get voting out of the way. We're gonna play a little bitty clip to the songs one more time.

1395
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:09,600
We're going to name them all, and here's a little bit of it.

1396
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:11,400
This one is Sasha with Expander.

1397
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:26,840
OK, that's enough.

1398
01:45:26,840 --> 01:45:31,280
Next one is Robert Miles with Fable.

1399
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:32,520
Yay.

1400
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:38,760
Okay, that's enough of that.

1401
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:41,760
And then leak, and then leak, same.

1402
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:44,640
Okay, that's enough of that.

1403
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:45,640
Vote!

1404
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:46,640
Vote now!

1405
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:50,880
In the meantime, we're gonna hand the microphone to Loki to go angst on us again while I pull

1406
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:51,880
up the next break.

1407
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:55,640
Well, I'm gonna do the Monty news, because we promised it like, we promised it like an

1408
01:45:55,640 --> 01:46:00,760
hour ago and we never did it, so you've all been sitting there getting moist, your panties

1409
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:03,760
to be getting moist in anticipation of this hot, hot...

1410
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:04,760
I'm drying up my...

1411
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:09,760
I can't believe Puppy just said that!

1412
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:10,760
Say that again!

1413
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:12,760
Things dried up by now!

1414
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:14,760
Never, Krusty!

1415
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:15,760
God!

1416
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:18,760
Things I did not need to know.

1417
01:46:18,760 --> 01:46:19,760
Alright.

1418
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:21,760
I am stealing this news.

1419
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:24,760
I will quote my source because a lot of people don't.

1420
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:27,760
I was just surfing around the net during one of the breaks and I found this news.

1421
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:29,760
It was posted on the LiveJournal community for Bamani.

1422
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:35,160
So, it's just username Bemani on the LiveJournal community, livejournal.com slash tilde Bemani.

1423
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:39,600
And by the way, I'll take this opportunity to plug that Orange Lounge also has a LiveJournal

1424
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:40,600
community.

1425
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:44,000
So, if you go to livejournal.com slash tilde Orange Lounge, there's our community.

1426
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,800
So, if you use LiveJournal, add us to your friends list because we like it when people

1427
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:48,800
add us to their friends list.

1428
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:53,800
I had a LiveJournal once, then I never posted and they got rid of it for me.

1429
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:56,120
All right, here we go.

1430
01:46:56,120 --> 01:46:57,440
I don't think they deleted Council again.

1431
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:58,840
I think you just forgot your password.

1432
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:02,300
alright or somebody hacked it all of them he had stored your account is

1433
01:47:02,300 --> 01:47:04,540
holding a real bastard alright

1434
01:47:04,540 --> 01:47:07,020
here we go raises raster here we go

1435
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:10,360
that this was up i'm in a credit and actually i think this person's on the

1436
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:13,680
orange launch community which makes them that much cooler this is posted by

1437
01:47:13,680 --> 01:47:15,560
hata hata maybe that's

1438
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:16,960
at the heart are something

1439
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:17,700
yeah i have not

1440
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:20,760
it was a hater to me

1441
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:22,620
that's in our community too

1442
01:47:22,620 --> 01:47:25,060
that's what i thought

1443
01:47:25,060 --> 01:47:28,300
very nice news and i love the icon she even though she is nice she doesn't

1444
01:47:28,300 --> 01:47:33,340
need to like not misspell things on purpose whatever it looks like hater

1445
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:41,980
anyway posted about a 2d x night style location test so again I don't know how

1446
01:47:41,980 --> 01:47:45,140
reliable this new source is take it with a grain of salt but this is this is just

1447
01:47:45,140 --> 01:47:49,780
all in fun right so finally Konami will launch the location test for Bahmani 2d

1448
01:47:49,780 --> 01:47:54,100
x night style on May 5th we have rumors saying that this is going to be the last

1449
01:47:54,100 --> 01:47:57,340
Last installment, but it has not been confirmed yet.

1450
01:47:57,340 --> 01:48:00,380
On the official site, they announced a few songs that will be brought back, however,

1451
01:48:00,380 --> 01:48:01,380
that is not all.

1452
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:04,700
We all know that Beatmania has closed its history last year with the release of Beatmania

1453
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:05,700
the Final.

1454
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:06,700
It was not over yet.

1455
01:48:06,700 --> 01:48:09,540
They are also bringing back some songs that was on Beatmania.

1456
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:15,100
The songs include LED Hellscaper, Tack with Release Your Mind, Pink Pong with Pink Dream,

1457
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:20,740
The Bald Heads Scagogo, DJ Naguro with Miriam, featuring Believe Again.

1458
01:48:20,740 --> 01:48:23,860
Just to name a few, I'm pretty sure that some of those songs would be remixed by our favorite

1459
01:48:23,860 --> 01:48:27,580
artists due to massive resurrection of classic Beatmania songs, it is possible that they

1460
01:48:27,580 --> 01:48:32,420
may have to take out many 2DX songs as well.

1461
01:48:32,420 --> 01:48:37,140
Of course, we will have new songs brought to us by DJ Taka, Tack, Ram and many other

1462
01:48:37,140 --> 01:48:38,140
familiar names.

1463
01:48:38,140 --> 01:48:43,780
Some songs that would definitely catch our heart include Taka with Natural Principle,

1464
01:48:43,780 --> 01:48:51,340
Aya with Death Wind, Tack with Irrational, Yamato with X49, and Akira Yamaka with Electric

1465
01:48:51,340 --> 01:48:52,340
Wave.

1466
01:48:52,340 --> 01:49:04,340
I also scoured several of my downloading places and I haven't found that anywhere.

1467
01:49:22,340 --> 01:49:27,780
Konami in Japan paid attention, but I'm sure as popular as it is in Japan, they wouldn't

1468
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:28,780
cut it off now.

1469
01:49:28,780 --> 01:49:32,580
Just don't let 2DX get in the hands of, uh, Konami of America, holy crap.

1470
01:49:32,580 --> 01:49:34,580
Oh god, that's a scary thought!

1471
01:49:34,580 --> 01:49:36,780
And Rob almost fell out of his chair.

1472
01:49:36,780 --> 01:49:40,540
Unless they're gonna give us, like, you know, 9-Key 2DX or something, I don't know.

1473
01:49:40,540 --> 01:49:42,440
That'd be weird.

1474
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:45,440
But then it'd be Popping DX!

1475
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:46,440
Resurrect...

1476
01:49:46,440 --> 01:49:50,820
Resurrect frickin', um, what was it, Kraken DJ.

1477
01:49:50,820 --> 01:49:51,820
Kraken DJ's the shit.

1478
01:49:51,820 --> 01:49:52,900
I like that game a lot.

1479
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:54,380
Anybody else want to say anything about night style,

1480
01:49:54,380 --> 01:49:55,480
night style being the last things

1481
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:57,620
they want to see on night style?

1482
01:49:57,620 --> 01:49:59,940
I don't know, more talking.

1483
01:49:59,940 --> 01:50:05,860
If this were the last 2DX, say if they do a BeatMania 4,

1484
01:50:05,860 --> 01:50:07,500
a fourth series or whatever.

1485
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:09,940
What do you think they should do in it?

1486
01:50:09,940 --> 01:50:12,420
I was actually talking about this earlier today with Zero.

1487
01:50:12,420 --> 01:50:15,340
I was saying that they should add, much like BeatMania 3

1488
01:50:15,340 --> 01:50:19,460
had the foot pedal effector thing, which didn't do shit,

1489
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:23,860
Crossfader. Like, we were talking about, what was it we were talking about? Oh, Healing

1490
01:50:23,860 --> 01:50:27,340
Vision Angelic, where that one part where it's just all da-na-na-na, they have that

1491
01:50:27,340 --> 01:50:31,500
be like a Crossfader part on there. Something like that, I don't know. A little bit more

1492
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:37,500
elaborate. I was thinking also, you know, like in Keyboard Mania, how you have the wheel.

1493
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:43,140
Something like that, yeah. Yeah. Here's my suggestion, this is the same thing they need

1494
01:50:43,140 --> 01:50:47,940
to do to DDR. Like, when they bring DDR to a new series, if they're gonna do a DDR, 2DX

1495
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:53,940
or whatever. They need to do a... Well, Freeze Notes is one thing, because Easy to DJ has

1496
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:55,940
that, but it's kind of overrated.

1497
01:50:55,940 --> 01:51:03,580
They do have that. It's pretty cool. It's very few songs have it. I would suggest some

1498
01:51:03,580 --> 01:51:08,180
kind of more elaborate battle mode. Like, imagine if they had the thing in Disney's

1499
01:51:08,180 --> 01:51:10,620
Rave to 2DX. That would be cool.

1500
01:51:10,620 --> 01:51:21,620
Oh yeah, yes, exactly. They have all these characters that they don't use anymore because they're the total background.

1501
01:51:21,620 --> 01:51:27,620
I think the new versions of DDR and 2DX need to have more competitive modes because DDR has always been a co-op game till now.

1502
01:51:27,620 --> 01:51:31,620
They need freaking Dance Battle again. That was in Second Mix.

1503
01:51:31,620 --> 01:51:37,620
Exactly. If it elaborated a little more on competition, I think it would be a kick-ass game.

1504
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:42,620
Well, actually, what I would like to see again is another Link version.

1505
01:51:42,620 --> 01:51:46,620
I think that would be a really good idea.

1506
01:51:46,620 --> 01:51:50,620
So you think maybe it's a coincidence they're ending DDR and 2DX at the same time?

1507
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:55,620
To bring them back as this big, sub-stream resurrection?

1508
01:51:55,620 --> 01:51:57,620
Maybe. Maybe not.

1509
01:51:57,620 --> 01:52:05,620
You know what I'd like to see? I'd like to see Beatmania's song selection on DDR.

1510
01:52:05,620 --> 01:52:12,620
Just get rid of all that shit that they're ripping from like Dance Mania, like all these speed mixes, anything from Wild Side, no.

1511
01:52:12,620 --> 01:52:20,620
I say the Dance Mania stuff is the best stuff in DDR. It always is. Except, they do a little, sometimes not, but nine times less.

1512
01:52:20,620 --> 01:52:24,620
As in the Queen songs that they horribly rape and destroy.

1513
01:52:24,620 --> 01:52:26,620
The most freestyle of the songs.

1514
01:52:26,620 --> 01:52:28,620
Always the most freestylable songs out of anything in DDR.

1515
01:52:28,620 --> 01:52:36,620
So you're saying that you would rather take Senorita's Speedy Mix versus The Sound of Goodbye or Never Look Back...

1516
01:52:36,620 --> 01:52:39,620
But See, The Sound of Goodbye and Never Look Back are licensed songs as well.

1517
01:52:39,620 --> 01:52:40,620
Fly Away...

1518
01:52:40,620 --> 01:52:44,620
Those are all licensed songs you're naming. They're not Konami originals. They're all licensed songs.

1519
01:52:44,620 --> 01:52:49,620
Alright, fine. General Relativity, 19 November. How about WOWL70?

1520
01:52:49,620 --> 01:52:52,620
I'm not saying to get rid of those, but don't get rid of the Dance Mania stuff because that's some of the best stuff.

1521
01:52:52,620 --> 01:52:55,620
Oh, what am I talking about anyways? They just fuck up the steps in the first place.

1522
01:52:55,620 --> 01:52:56,620
Exactly.

1523
01:52:56,620 --> 01:53:01,620
Yeah, most of the dance weenie stuff is fine, but I got one word for you. JOGA.

1524
01:53:01,620 --> 01:53:06,620
Okay. I got one word for you.

1525
01:53:06,620 --> 01:53:09,620
I got one word for you, bitch. Politary.

1526
01:53:09,620 --> 01:53:12,620
No, JOGA. Also known as Ban for Moore's Lounge.

1527
01:53:12,620 --> 01:53:17,620
Cause they do, they're nothing but the same damn song every time.

1528
01:53:17,620 --> 01:53:20,620
Oh god, look, he just said he wants to make a remix.

1529
01:53:20,620 --> 01:53:22,620
Please do a JOGA remix. Please, please, please.

1530
01:53:22,620 --> 01:53:25,620
Rob, by the way, I warned you, that's the trap chair. Don't fall.

1531
01:53:25,620 --> 01:53:28,620
And Rob almost fell out of it again. That's like the second time in five minutes.

1532
01:53:55,620 --> 01:54:00,620
Yeah, like, uh, We Are The Champions, because that song just played so much.

1533
01:54:00,620 --> 01:54:02,620
I mean, I can't tell you how many times they tell people,

1534
01:54:02,620 --> 01:54:07,620
Stop playing We Are The Champions, keep hearing that song over and over.

1535
01:54:07,620 --> 01:54:11,620
They took Queen and made it gay.

1536
01:54:11,620 --> 01:54:12,620
That's, that's...

1537
01:54:12,620 --> 01:54:15,620
And for the record, I play that song.

1538
01:54:15,620 --> 01:54:18,620
And for the record, Queen was gay.

1539
01:54:18,620 --> 01:54:20,620
I know that, dammit!

1540
01:54:20,620 --> 01:54:22,620
But the music wasn't until that.

1541
01:54:22,620 --> 01:54:25,620
I think we just made JB have a cry because it's SyFam.

1542
01:54:25,620 --> 01:54:28,620
Ice Queen, by the way, just got his name with that.

1543
01:54:28,620 --> 01:54:32,620
Even still, you know, there's better stuff that's come from SyFam.

1544
01:54:32,620 --> 01:54:36,620
Look at freakin' DDR USA. Those songs were awesome.

1545
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:38,620
You know, take it to the morning light, you know...

1546
01:54:38,620 --> 01:54:41,620
Ooh, nah nah nah nah nah, yeah!

1547
01:54:41,620 --> 01:54:44,620
Yeah! Seriously, better than...

1548
01:54:44,620 --> 01:54:46,620
We are the champions!

1549
01:54:46,620 --> 01:54:49,620
Ooh, nah nah nah nah nah, yeah!

1550
01:54:49,620 --> 01:54:52,620
Dark Black Forest, I mean, that was awesome.

1551
01:54:52,620 --> 01:54:55,620
Ooh, and SADSTORM!

1552
01:54:55,620 --> 01:54:57,620
We can RAVE!

1553
01:54:57,620 --> 01:55:01,620
You know what, I think we're gonna probably have to take a break.

1554
01:55:01,620 --> 01:55:03,620
I have one more story that needs to be read.

1555
01:55:03,620 --> 01:55:05,620
Needs to be read, because actually some people were alluding to this.

1556
01:55:05,620 --> 01:55:06,620
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

1557
01:55:06,620 --> 01:55:08,620
We have to also tell you the truth.

1558
01:55:08,620 --> 01:55:10,620
Yeah, we have to tell you the truth. We'll do that during the break.

1559
01:55:10,620 --> 01:55:12,620
But I have to read this news.

1560
01:55:12,620 --> 01:55:15,620
And now, again, as with the last story,

1561
01:55:15,620 --> 01:55:32,820
Konami of Japan told that they are thinking about introducing Beatmania 2DX to the USA.

1562
01:55:32,820 --> 01:55:36,580
After gaining so much popularity by their release of DDR USA Mix, they said they are

1563
01:55:36,580 --> 01:55:38,940
considering the release of the 2DX series as well.

1564
01:55:38,940 --> 01:55:43,940
The Konami of Japan says DDR USA was a big success, the number of players are still increasing

1565
01:55:43,940 --> 01:55:47,620
and we also get several emails asking if we are going to release the American version

1566
01:55:47,620 --> 01:55:52,020
of 2DX. Konami of America is excited about this as well. One of the spokesmen said the

1567
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:58,900
DJ scene is probably more popular in America than Japan. I am sure that the game will catch

1568
01:55:58,900 --> 01:56:05,900
the heart of both real DJs, not yet Loki, and the people who want to be one. So want

1569
01:56:06,620 --> 01:56:13,580
to be a DJ, just start playing 2DX, that's exactly what they're saying here. The music

1570
01:56:13,580 --> 01:56:18,100
is great for audience too, and I don't see why this can't be a success. It is rumored

1571
01:56:18,100 --> 01:56:23,940
that the new machine will be revealed to E3 2003. Depending on the schedule, it might

1572
01:56:23,940 --> 01:56:31,480
be postponed to 2004. Unlike DDR, instead of the home controller, the entire machine

1573
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:35,380
will be brought in and it will be on free play. They are also thinking about bringing

1574
01:56:35,380 --> 01:56:39,540
guest players from Japan to show us how the game is played. That's where I start to think

1575
01:56:39,540 --> 01:56:42,380
the story's bullshit i think the story's bullshit right there they don't need to

1576
01:56:42,380 --> 01:56:43,940
go to cg daily city

1577
01:56:43,940 --> 01:56:46,900
that well you know that'll be cool all they don't need to do that

1578
01:56:46,900 --> 01:56:50,100
there's very good players here locally yet

1579
01:56:50,100 --> 01:56:52,620
i mean when i say locally in california

1580
01:56:52,620 --> 01:56:56,000
they don't acknowledge any of those people mean hello look at drop the bomb

1581
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:56,900
system at that

1582
01:56:56,900 --> 01:56:57,780
but six

1583
01:56:57,780 --> 01:57:01,380
what will i go i don't think the i'm talking about bringing in the players is

1584
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:04,380
that that's what they did last year you do they have all u s players and i know

1585
01:57:04,380 --> 01:57:07,020
mel is down there it makes it it would make sense

1586
01:57:07,020 --> 01:57:10,900
that they would use local players if they know that there's a local scene.

1587
01:57:10,900 --> 01:57:13,940
Well, anyway, let me finish and give the rest of his comments.

1588
01:57:13,940 --> 01:57:17,820
One more exciting news about this is that they will have some songs that's

1589
01:57:17,820 --> 01:57:20,540
only featured on the USA version of 2DX only.

1590
01:57:20,540 --> 01:57:23,400
However, it may not satisfy some expert players, so this is going to be the

1591
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:24,900
first release of 2DX in America.

1592
01:57:24,900 --> 01:57:28,260
It may be aimed at beginner players so they can get into the game easily.

1593
01:57:28,260 --> 01:57:31,220
It's possible that the new feature is included like the beginner mode in DDR

1594
01:57:31,220 --> 01:57:35,500
USA, possibly similar to the drill mode that's featured in 2DX 5th, 6th

1595
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:36,620
homestyle version.

1596
01:57:36,620 --> 01:57:39,300
this might be a good chance for people who live outside of california to try

1597
01:57:39,300 --> 01:57:41,640
this game out

1598
01:57:41,640 --> 01:57:44,840
i'm actually going to um...

1599
01:57:44,840 --> 01:57:49,060
take those to uh... a source and see if i can find any legitimacy but i doubt

1600
01:57:49,060 --> 01:57:50,360
that it is

1601
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:53,480
we'll find out but just take it with a grain of salt that's a new story going

1602
01:57:53,480 --> 01:57:57,240
around we're gonna report it

1603
01:57:57,240 --> 01:57:58,880
the only

1604
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:02,720
the only way this is going to work is if they actually do a good job on this and

1605
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:03,660
you know

1606
01:58:03,660 --> 01:58:05,240
good music for this

1607
01:58:05,240 --> 01:58:05,880
um...

1608
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:12,880
However, looking at, you know, Konami of America's past track record, it's not looking good, folks.

1609
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:14,880
It's not looking good at all.

1610
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:17,880
I think they're gonna, I think they're gonna take 2DX and go,

1611
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:21,880
you know what? I think these players, because these players haven't played the Japanese songs,

1612
01:58:21,880 --> 01:58:24,880
so let's take a bunch of stuff from first style, and then we're gonna take a shit on it,

1613
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:26,880
and then we're gonna add some new songs, too.

1614
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:28,880
No, no, wait, I'm gonna, I'm gonna disagree.

1615
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:33,880
Because if they, now, if they don't screw it, if they don't try to do this,

1616
01:58:33,880 --> 01:58:38,040
We're going to do it on a learning curve. We're going to start easy with DDR USA, and then we're going to go to economics

1617
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:41,880
And then we're going to go to max USA which max USA if that had been the first one

1618
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:44,860
We would never have people bitching people would have been happy with that

1619
01:58:44,860 --> 01:58:48,460
And you know what people wouldn't bitch about how Konami messes it up, so

1620
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:53,280
You know what Konami which you need to do even though you want to milk the sales if you want to keep the fans

1621
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:58,640
Happy put it all encompassing into one game something that the beginners can pick up have your beginner mode

1622
01:58:58,680 --> 01:59:02,720
But have those and others that will murder us to the expert stuff and good songs

1623
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:06,720
Well, not just Light 7, I'm talking like the Beginner 1, 2, where every song's a one-star.

1624
01:59:06,720 --> 01:59:10,720
The Japanese ones have that, no one complains, it's pretty nice, it helps you learn how to play.

1625
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:15,720
Do that, don't just, don't give us a game that's only the 1, 2, and 3 stars, or people are gonna bitch.

1626
01:59:15,720 --> 01:59:16,720
That would be ugly.

1627
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:19,720
If you don't learn how to play, Light 7, leave it there.

1628
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:21,720
Keep your Light 7, keep your 7 key.

1629
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:24,720
That way you have room for people to get better.

1630
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:39,720
I'll just put it this way, you put Vincent DeMure's Eternity on there, I don't care what the fuck you do, you can put a big gay-ass character in the opening logo, I don't give a crap at all, I'll play the game if you have Eternity on there.

1631
01:59:39,720 --> 01:59:53,720
Hello, this is DJ Spanky, saying everybody should play 2DX USA. I endorse this fully. It has such wonderful songs in it, like Justify My Love by Madonna.

1632
01:59:53,720 --> 02:00:01,560
So Mr. Spanky, does the nice, booming subwoofer make you feel special?

1633
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:05,240
This is what I would suggest you do when 2DX comes to the USA.

1634
02:00:05,240 --> 02:00:10,080
Get your subwoofer and mount it really high so it comes up to the bar, then when you play,

1635
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:11,080
straddle the subwoofer.

1636
02:00:11,080 --> 02:00:12,080
It's much funner.

1637
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:13,080
Oh, God.

1638
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:14,080
Oh, God.

1639
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:15,080
Oh, God.

1640
02:00:15,080 --> 02:00:18,780
oh god

1641
02:00:18,780 --> 02:00:24,620
it'll make your balls bounce

1642
02:00:24,620 --> 02:00:25,680
okay

1643
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:26,660
that was

1644
02:00:26,660 --> 02:00:31,300
that was a little too much information

1645
02:00:31,300 --> 02:00:32,920
and the room falls silent

1646
02:00:32,920 --> 02:00:36,400
i think that we should go to break while we tally the votes for a cage about which actually

1647
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:37,500
i've already done

1648
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:42,280
but uh... we'll go to break, we'll play a few songs, especially one by request

1649
02:00:42,280 --> 02:00:43,520
and then uh...

1650
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:49,520
I will announce the winner for the cage match, which I tabulated while Noah was looking.

1651
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:52,760
Anyway, yeah, here you go

1652
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:51,520
Come on!

1653
02:02:54,520 --> 02:02:56,520
Woo hoo!

1654
02:02:56,520 --> 02:02:57,020
Woo-hoo!

1655
02:03:56,520 --> 02:04:20,200
I said don't go, back it up again, you're never gonna keep me down

1656
02:05:20,200 --> 02:05:24,200
Ooh, ooh, ooh, can we sing it?

1657
02:06:50,200 --> 02:07:00,760
CH Theatre

1658
02:07:30,760 --> 02:07:34,760
I can feel the rhythm, ooh yeah

1659
02:07:34,760 --> 02:07:37,760

02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:05,760
Gotta get rid of the one, oh yeah

1665
02:09:05,760 --> 02:09:13,760
Gotta get rid of the one, follow the one

1666
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:29,760
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join

1667
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:31,640
us on all the fun together.

1668
02:09:31,640 --> 02:09:35,400
Hey, hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs

1669
02:09:35,400 --> 02:09:38,880
absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great?

1670
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:41,400
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

1671
02:09:41,400 --> 02:09:48,400
Take it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

02:10:25,040 --> 02:10:28,680
god i thought my tackling was that the ice queen's tackling with that

1676
02:10:28,680 --> 02:10:30,580
uh...

1677
02:10:30,580 --> 02:10:31,860
all right

1678
02:10:31,860 --> 02:10:34,860
what we got to do now though we're gonna set up for a listless redo listless

1679
02:10:34,860 --> 02:10:37,600
tonight right yes and what is the listless topic

1680
02:10:37,600 --> 02:10:40,000
the topic is

1681
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,760
What mocap game do we want to see?

1682
02:10:42,760 --> 02:10:44,520
You've had mocap boxing,

1683
02:10:44,520 --> 02:10:45,720
mocap golf,

1684
02:10:45,720 --> 02:10:49,680
and now what should the next mocap game be? What would we want to see here

1685
02:10:49,680 --> 02:10:50,480
in the studio?

1686
02:10:50,480 --> 02:10:51,940
That's tonight's list list.

1687
02:10:51,940 --> 02:10:53,360
So can we

1688
02:10:53,360 --> 02:10:57,040
can we queue up a quick song to give us time to think? I'm going to do a few songs.

1689
02:10:57,040 --> 02:10:59,820
Just do like, maybe like...

1690
02:10:59,820 --> 02:11:03,440
We hate to play so many songs in a row, but we just need the time to think here.

1691
02:11:03,440 --> 02:11:06,580
So we're going to do like maybe one or two quick songs,

1692
02:11:06,580 --> 02:11:09,280
and then we'll be back.

1693
02:11:09,280 --> 02:11:12,760
when it is a couple quick songs

1694
02:11:12,760 --> 02:11:15,900
little it in a chance to do it and i think that over well

1695
02:11:15,900 --> 02:11:18,420
that overwhelming response

1696
02:11:18,420 --> 02:11:24,260
so it is a transfer will come back and uh... do mocap

1697
02:11:24,260 --> 02:11:26,280
we're loading it up

1698
02:11:26,280 --> 02:11:28,320

so we're gonna play Legend of the Trance

1705
02:11:46,020 --> 02:11:50,180
if uh... we can get it

1706
02:11:50,180 --> 02:11:51,100
with an L

1707
02:11:51,100 --> 02:11:53,840
unfortunately not everybody in the studio is going to be able to help with

1708
02:11:53,840 --> 02:11:55,520
listless tonight but we'll uh...

1709
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:57,600
we'll let them break any ties we have

1710
02:11:57,600 --> 02:12:00,840
which we usually do to people who

1711
02:12:00,840 --> 02:12:01,780
it's not working

1712
02:12:01,780 --> 02:12:03,240
okay

1713
02:12:03,240 --> 02:12:06,740
we're having technical difficulties so we're trying again

1714
02:12:06,740 --> 02:12:07,840
I mean, it's not reading the CD.

1715
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:09,260
In the mean time...

1716
02:12:09,260 --> 02:12:15,540
That's the CD.

1717
02:12:15,540 --> 02:12:17,840
What else were you talking about during the break?

1718
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:21,520
Um...

1719
02:12:21,520 --> 02:12:26,580
Okay.

1720
02:12:26,580 --> 02:12:32,900
Uh, we're looking for the... There it is. Okay, yay, we got it. So we're gonna, uh, play Legend of the Trance and prepare our list list and we'll be right back.

1721
02:12:32,900 --> 02:12:39,900
you are listening to Orange Launch Radio.

1722
02:15:02,900 --> 02:15:22,620
Okay, we are back and we're ready.

1723
02:15:22,620 --> 02:15:23,620
We're going to do the list list.

1724
02:15:23,620 --> 02:15:24,620
Here we go.

1725
02:15:24,620 --> 02:15:28,220
So the way list list works, in case you're a new listener to the show, what we're going

1726
02:15:28,220 --> 02:15:29,980
to do, we're all going to name our top three.

1727
02:15:29,980 --> 02:15:35,060
We have six people in studio participating, the three hosts, interns Zero, Puppy, and

1728
02:15:35,060 --> 02:15:36,660
Artistry are all participating tonight.

1729
02:15:36,660 --> 02:15:37,660
Top three mocap games.

1730
02:15:37,660 --> 02:15:39,900
By the way, for the record, mocap stands for motion capture.

1731
02:15:39,900 --> 02:15:45,380
Yes, and you may have seen games like mocap boxing, golf, and another one, Tsuguri, which

1732
02:15:45,380 --> 02:15:46,380
is the sword game.

1733
02:15:46,380 --> 02:15:47,380
Very good.

1734
02:15:47,380 --> 02:15:53,900
Also, if you've never, if you've, police 911 is kind of a mocap game, you can kind of count

1735
02:15:53,900 --> 02:15:57,900
Para Para, whatever, you know, if you've never seen an actual mocap game, those are kind

1736
02:15:57,900 --> 02:15:58,900
of rough estimates of what it is.

1737
02:15:58,900 --> 02:16:00,500
It's a censor for your movement.

1738
02:16:00,500 --> 02:16:01,500
Exactly.

1739
02:16:01,500 --> 02:16:05,140
So, and then once we all name our top three, then we're going to do the elimination round,

1740
02:16:05,140 --> 02:16:06,140
which is always fun.

1741
02:16:06,140 --> 02:16:10,540
Each of us gets to take one off the list of somebody else's picks, or your own, if you

1742
02:16:10,540 --> 02:16:11,540
so choose.

1743
02:16:11,540 --> 02:16:14,060
I just kind of burped a little, that was good.

1744
02:16:14,060 --> 02:16:17,700
And then the chat room has the ultimate vote.

1745
02:16:17,700 --> 02:16:19,500
They're going to vote on their top three.

1746
02:16:19,500 --> 02:16:23,020
And Ice Queen and DDRHolic, they're not doing lists, but they'll help us break ties.

1747
02:16:23,020 --> 02:16:25,620
And Bombay's in the back there too, but he's digging through things.

1748
02:16:25,620 --> 02:16:28,660
Are you, oh you look like you were hunched over looking at something.

1749
02:16:28,660 --> 02:16:31,780
Are you gonna hurl? Do you need a barf bag? Are you okay?

1750
02:16:31,780 --> 02:16:34,700
Do you need a donkey bag? Alright. Alright, here we go.

1751
02:16:34,700 --> 02:16:38,820
My first choice for a mocap game

1752
02:16:38,820 --> 02:16:42,420
is mocap horse racing. Mocap horse racing, yay!

1753
02:16:42,420 --> 02:16:46,340
Where you're suspended on a giant saddle and have to spank.

1754
02:16:46,340 --> 02:16:51,140
I almost had one like that on my list. Almost like that horse humping game that Namco put out, but not.

1755
02:16:51,140 --> 02:16:57,540
Oh, uh, final furlong? Yeah.

1756
02:16:57,540 --> 02:16:59,180
that would be fun now

1757
02:16:59,180 --> 02:17:00,900
uh... vocab horse racing

1758
02:17:00,900 --> 02:17:03,100
would it be will complete with initial be like arts

1759
02:17:03,100 --> 02:17:04,540
yeah okay

1760
02:17:04,540 --> 02:17:10,100
all right moving on was next next

1761
02:17:10,100 --> 02:17:12,820
first choice is vocab drug dealing

1762
02:17:12,820 --> 02:17:15,260
but without a drug dealing how would that work

1763
02:17:15,260 --> 02:17:17,220
and i at least i want to reverse

1764
02:17:17,220 --> 02:17:21,000
pretty much like you have a certain type period to get your product out on the

1765
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,420
street as much as possible

1766
02:17:23,420 --> 02:17:25,420
What exactly is being mocapped?

1767
02:17:25,420 --> 02:17:27,420
You've run from cops.

1768
02:17:30,420 --> 02:17:32,420
You've actually got to hand it to people and stuff.

1769
02:17:33,420 --> 02:17:36,420
So are you on a treadmill when you do the running part?

1770
02:17:36,420 --> 02:17:38,420
How fast can you whip out a ten?

1771
02:17:39,420 --> 02:17:41,420
How fast can you take the money and do the drop and the drop?

1772
02:17:41,420 --> 02:17:43,420
Catch the dime bags!

1773
02:17:46,420 --> 02:17:50,420
Well, I'm just going to kind of expand on one of them that I had.

1774
02:17:50,420 --> 02:17:52,420
I originally had put down mocap dancing.

1775
02:17:52,420 --> 02:17:58,420
But instead, I'm going to put down Mocap Raivar.

1776
02:17:58,420 --> 02:18:01,420
No, that's just Para Para, I thought.

1777
02:18:01,420 --> 02:18:13,420
No, see, Para Para is more organized. Mocap Raivar is more of like, you're kind of just, yeah, more flailing involved.

1778
02:18:13,420 --> 02:18:17,420
You got special bonus rounds where you get to massage people on E.

1779
02:18:17,420 --> 02:18:21,420
Yeah, like the first thing, right, when you put in your money, it drops out an e-pill.

1780
02:18:21,420 --> 02:18:23,420
You have to take it and wait five minutes.

1781
02:18:23,420 --> 02:18:25,420
Exactly.

1782
02:18:25,420 --> 02:18:27,420
It has little glow sticks on strings.

1783
02:18:27,420 --> 02:18:30,420
It has little glow sticks on strings.

1784
02:18:30,420 --> 02:18:32,420
That's beautiful. Alright.

1785
02:18:32,420 --> 02:18:33,420
I think the lights flicker, too.

1786
02:18:33,420 --> 02:18:34,420
Mocap Rayvar.

1787
02:18:34,420 --> 02:18:37,420
Uh, moving on to Dark Tetsuya.

1788
02:18:39,420 --> 02:18:41,420
Mocap Murder Simulator.

1789
02:18:41,420 --> 02:18:43,420
Mocap Murder!

1790
02:18:43,420 --> 02:18:47,420
So would it just be just like stabbing people or shooting them?

1791
02:18:47,420 --> 02:18:49,420
I guess, yeah.

1792
02:18:49,420 --> 02:18:52,420
What kind of people would you be murdering?

1793
02:18:52,420 --> 02:18:53,420
Terrorists.

1794
02:18:53,420 --> 02:18:56,420
Oh, terrorists. Aw, what an American answer.

1795
02:18:56,420 --> 02:18:57,420
Go down.

1796
02:18:57,420 --> 02:18:58,420
All right.

1797
02:18:58,420 --> 02:19:00,420
Uh, puppy.

1798
02:19:00,420 --> 02:19:01,420
Okay.

1799
02:19:01,420 --> 02:19:03,420
Mocap binge drinking.

1800
02:19:03,420 --> 02:19:05,420
Mocap?

1801
02:19:05,420 --> 02:19:08,420
That's kinda like last night.

1802
02:19:08,420 --> 02:19:10,420
Mocap binge drinking.

1803
02:19:10,420 --> 02:19:15,060
I don't think anyone was binging.

1804
02:19:15,060 --> 02:19:16,640
That was great, yeah. Anyway.

1805
02:19:16,640 --> 02:19:20,220
Okay, mocap binging. How would that work? Would you have to, like, would it have, like, a floating keg?

1806
02:19:20,220 --> 02:19:22,060
You'd have to...

1807
02:19:22,060 --> 02:19:24,900
You'd probably have to, like, run...

1808
02:19:24,900 --> 02:19:27,380
Yeah.

1809
02:19:27,380 --> 02:19:28,420
Okay.

1810
02:19:28,420 --> 02:19:30,680
Kind of along those same lines.

1811
02:19:30,680 --> 02:19:37,700
Um, my number three choice, I said, is mocap girls gone wild.

1812
02:19:37,700 --> 02:19:42,020
or what it does is it motion caps the girls lifting their shirts

1813
02:19:42,020 --> 02:19:46,460
and showing their hooters to the uh... like boobies to mocap

1814
02:19:46,460 --> 02:19:50,740
and then

1815
02:19:50,740 --> 02:19:53,820
yeah i can see it now a bunch of little eight-year-old kids lighting up around

1816
02:19:53,820 --> 02:19:59,060
this machine and seeing this chick just lifting up her shirt

1817
02:19:59,060 --> 02:20:05,280
and all and mocap girls gone wild would have internet ranking of course

1818
02:20:05,280 --> 02:20:08,020

1853
02:21:27,780 --> 02:21:29,660

1854
02:21:29,660 --> 02:21:32,400

1858
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:42,980

1859
02:21:42,980 --> 02:21:45,640
do you have like the from the trunk level

1860
02:21:45,640 --> 02:21:49,580

mocha game because

1864
02:21:55,440 --> 02:21:58,200
I don't know if you guys have heard, but here in Sacramento we have this guy who's famous

1865
02:21:58,200 --> 02:22:02,560
for riding around on a bike in the middle of the night and punching women in the face.

1866
02:22:02,560 --> 02:22:07,840
Which sounds funny, but it's a horrible crime, I mean, but, just, it's, it's weird. That's

1867
02:22:07,840 --> 02:22:11,040
the only way you can describe it. What kind of guy just goes around and punches people

1868
02:22:11,040 --> 02:22:13,760
in the face? Anyway.

1869
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:15,400
I don't think it's a guy, I think I'm doing it.

1870
02:22:15,400 --> 02:22:23,280
You know, like, DC Sniper, you would, like, actually have to get in different positions,

1871
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:27,480
like the prone position and hiding in bushes and stuff and then you'd have to

1872
02:22:27,480 --> 02:22:34,800

1883
02:23:23,720 --> 02:23:25,840
Mocap line dancing.

1884
02:23:25,840 --> 02:23:26,840

I want to do the electric slide.

1888
02:23:30,480 --> 02:23:31,480
That would be beautiful.

1889
02:23:31,480 --> 02:23:32,480
Okay.

1890
02:23:32,480 --> 02:23:34,560
You get it complete with a ten-gallon hat.

1891
02:23:34,560 --> 02:23:36,560
And boots.

1892
02:23:36,560 --> 02:23:37,560

02:23:41,480 --> 02:23:47,980
My number two, mocap donkey punch.

1897
02:23:47,980 --> 02:23:50,980
What exactly would you be doing in that game?

1898
02:23:50,980 --> 02:23:57,980
Anita, how does a donkey punch work?

1899
02:23:57,980 --> 02:24:02,980
Well, how come you think I know so much about it?

1900
02:24:02,980 --> 02:24:05,980
Because you brought it up last night.

1901
02:24:05,980 --> 02:24:09,980
Okay, when, um, everybody knows what donkey punching is.

1902
02:24:09,980 --> 02:24:16,460
We don't we need you to could you please explain it. Okay, if you are doing a person in the

1903
02:24:18,140 --> 02:24:20,140
Yes, yes, like well, okay

1904
02:24:22,180 --> 02:24:25,980
Okay, freaking donkey punching is when you're like taking chick from behind me

1905
02:24:25,980 --> 02:24:29,140
You just you take your fist and you smack it in the back of her head

1906
02:24:30,340 --> 02:24:35,220
As hard as you can as hard you can so that she clenches. Yeah

1907
02:24:35,220 --> 02:24:41,220
So you're fucking so many abs and then you start striking him in the back of the head.

1908
02:24:41,220 --> 02:24:43,220
It can also be applied to men.

1909
02:24:48,220 --> 02:24:49,220
Okay.

1910
02:24:49,220 --> 02:24:50,220
Right, okay.

1911
02:24:50,220 --> 02:24:52,220

02:25:02,220 --> 02:25:13,220
Where it records your movements of like stage one is writing your name in the snow, and then like you know mocap you know like just peeing things in the snow. Be beautiful.

1917
02:25:13,220 --> 02:25:14,220
Only guys could play that.

1918
02:25:14,220 --> 02:25:15,220
Okay, you know like Mario Party 4?

1919
02:25:15,220 --> 02:25:17,220
It came from every woman who wishes she had a penis.

1920
02:25:17,220 --> 02:25:23,220
Well now you can! Now you can! And you know what, I know women that do the same damn thing. They pee in the snow.

1921
02:25:23,220 --> 02:25:24,220
Maybe I should be playing a guitar.

1922
02:25:24,220 --> 02:25:28,220
I'm trying to run. They write their name by running.

1923
02:25:28,220 --> 02:25:32,220
I've heard stories.

1924
02:25:32,220 --> 02:25:36,220
They write their name really big by running.

1925
02:25:36,220 --> 02:25:40,220
For the people who are not here watching, Rob just turned purple.

1926
02:25:40,220 --> 02:25:44,220
My turn!

1927
02:25:44,220 --> 02:25:48,220
And actually, mine is not a funny one. Mine is actually a legitimate thing that I wish that they would make.

1928
02:25:48,220 --> 02:25:52,220
We can't have that.

1929
02:25:52,220 --> 02:25:53,220
Whoa!

1930
02:25:53,220 --> 02:25:54,220
Whoa!

1931
02:25:54,220 --> 02:25:58,960
Were you like, you know, you play the, you play, you play the, um, the District of Tron

1932
02:25:58,960 --> 02:26:00,300
and you had your light cycle level.

1933
02:26:00,300 --> 02:26:01,300
I don't even know what an 80's movie is, shit.

1934
02:26:01,300 --> 02:26:02,300
Just trying to win?

1935
02:26:02,300 --> 02:26:03,300
Yeah.

1936
02:26:03,300 --> 02:26:04,300
I don't know, I'm serious.

1937
02:26:04,300 --> 02:26:07,860
And this actually came, comes from a dream that I had a couple nights ago after I watched

1938
02:26:07,860 --> 02:26:11,700
Tron where I dreamt that I was playing like this, a virtual Tron simulator game.

1939
02:26:11,700 --> 02:26:12,700
It was so cool.

1940
02:26:12,700 --> 02:26:13,700
That actually...

1941
02:26:13,700 --> 02:26:15,020
And I like woke up all disappointed and then was trying.

1942
02:26:15,020 --> 02:26:17,900
Tron is one of those 80 games that everybody like remembers, I think.

1943
02:26:17,900 --> 02:26:18,900
I do anyway.

1944
02:26:18,900 --> 02:26:20,900
By the way, Tron 2.0 needs to hurry up and come out.

1945
02:26:20,900 --> 02:26:21,900
Yeah.

1946
02:26:21,900 --> 02:26:23,900
mocap zanadu

1947
02:26:23,900 --> 02:26:25,900
oh god

1948
02:26:25,900 --> 02:26:27,900
we were back? hello

1949
02:26:27,900 --> 02:26:29,900
i hope they got the mocap

1950
02:26:29,900 --> 02:26:31,900
did they get mocap-tron? i hope so

1951
02:26:31,900 --> 02:26:33,900
we'll see

1952
02:26:33,900 --> 02:26:35,900
alright keep going

1953
02:26:35,900 --> 02:26:37,900
one i got is for the most

1954
02:26:37,900 --> 02:26:39,900
worth of sport in the world

1955
02:26:39,900 --> 02:26:41,900
and it would be mocap curling

1956
02:26:41,900 --> 02:26:43,900
so i just see someone like

1957
02:26:43,900 --> 02:26:45,900
shaking their head

1958
02:26:45,900 --> 02:26:47,900
and they're like

1959
02:26:47,900 --> 02:26:49,900
like

1960
02:26:49,900 --> 02:26:58,900
So I just see someone shuffling a disc, and then you can have a friend play, and you're both running in front with these little brooms trying to scrape out imaginary ice.

1961
02:26:58,900 --> 02:27:00,900
Greatest Olympic sport ever.

1962
02:27:00,900 --> 02:27:05,900
Because you can thank the Canadians for the greatest sport in history.

1963
02:27:05,900 --> 02:27:08,900
You're throwing 40,000 rocks at me.

1964
02:27:08,900 --> 02:27:17,900
Yes. Imagine it now. The game about the thing that most people spies. The worst form of life on the face of the earth. That's right.

1965
02:27:17,900 --> 02:27:19,900
Mocap Panamime.

1966
02:27:19,900 --> 02:27:24,900
Oh, that's great. Mocap Mime. Alright.

1967
02:27:25,900 --> 02:27:27,900
If you kicked a mime in the nuts, would you scream?

1968
02:27:30,900 --> 02:27:33,900
Alright. Dark Tetsuya says, for his number one.

1969
02:27:33,900 --> 02:27:36,900
Three words. Mocap Mud Wrestling.

1970
02:27:36,900 --> 02:27:38,900
Mocap Mud Wrestling, beautiful.

1971
02:27:38,900 --> 02:27:39,900
I wonder where that came from.

1972
02:27:39,900 --> 02:27:41,900
Would the sequel be Mocap Cream Corn Wrestling?

1973
02:27:43,900 --> 02:27:44,900
K.Y. Wrestling.

1974
02:27:47,900 --> 02:27:49,900
There's a scene for that in that movie Old School.

1975
02:27:49,900 --> 02:27:50,900
Anyway...

1976
02:27:57,900 --> 02:28:00,900
I realized that my number one choice sucks.

1977
02:28:00,900 --> 02:28:04,900
I'm trying to think of a new one so Rob can go ahead of me for...

1978
02:28:04,900 --> 02:28:08,800
Cuz I have any socks. Yes. Well, just read it anyway. No

1986
02:28:40,500 --> 02:28:43,500
MoCap Quidditch.

1987
02:28:43,500 --> 02:28:48,500
Well, there already is, there was that motion sensing Tekken 3 thing before.

1988
02:28:48,500 --> 02:28:50,500
Um, no.

1989
02:28:50,500 --> 02:28:52,500
Yeah.

1990
02:28:52,500 --> 02:28:54,500
Keep going.

1991
02:28:54,500 --> 02:28:57,500
MoCap Friday the 13th.

1992
02:28:57,500 --> 02:29:04,500

1993
02:29:05,380 --> 02:29:08,900

i have it from a

1996
02:29:16,820 --> 02:29:23,820
you can't really motion capture that

1997
02:29:23,820 --> 02:29:27,820
I want mocap shopping.

1998
02:29:27,820 --> 02:29:31,820
You know what, actually, I'll go with that one that Loki recommends here.

1999
02:29:31,820 --> 02:29:33,820
Mocap pole dancing.

2000
02:29:33,820 --> 02:29:36,820
Mocap pole dancing, beautiful.

2001
02:29:36,820 --> 02:29:38,820
Be your own, be the stripper.

2002
02:29:38,820 --> 02:29:40,820
I like that mocap shopping, though.

2003
02:29:40,820 --> 02:29:43,820
That could be, like, they could have snow art on one side and shopping on the other.

2004
02:29:43,820 --> 02:29:44,820
Something for the guys and the girls.

2005
02:29:44,820 --> 02:29:49,820
Mocap supermarket sweep.

2006
02:29:49,820 --> 02:29:51,820
You wanna change your answer?

2007
02:29:51,820 --> 02:29:52,820
Yes.

2008
02:29:52,820 --> 02:29:54,820
I want to change my answer.

2009
02:29:54,820 --> 02:29:56,820
Probably changes from pole dancing to supermarket sweep.

2010
02:29:56,820 --> 02:29:59,820
That show is cool beyond belief.

2011
02:30:02,820 --> 02:30:07,820
Alright, my number one answer, and I can't believe this hasn't already been named, but I think it's the obvious.

2012
02:30:07,820 --> 02:30:09,820
Mocap spanking.

2013
02:30:11,820 --> 02:30:14,820
I thought there was that one game where you actually had this slap.

2014
02:30:14,820 --> 02:30:16,820
Yeah, that one.

2015
02:30:16,820 --> 02:30:19,820
No, you actually shove your finger up your ass. Well, not your ass, but the guy's ass.

2016
02:30:19,820 --> 02:30:21,820
I thought it was actually just me.

2017
02:30:21,820 --> 02:30:23,580
whatever i don't know

2018
02:30:23,580 --> 02:30:27,960
i said well you know what is in the mocap game in any mocap spanking

2019
02:30:27,960 --> 02:30:29,620
well i think we should start voting shit off the list

2020
02:30:29,620 --> 02:30:33,500
do you want to read what we have so far? so far we have mocap horse racing, mocap drug

02:30:58,960 --> 02:31:00,660
Donkey Punch.

2030
02:31:00,660 --> 02:31:04,820
Awwww.

2031
02:31:04,820 --> 02:31:08,540
I just, I don't think you can get the same sensation from a mocap game that you

2032
02:31:08,540 --> 02:31:10,020
could in real life.

2033
02:31:10,020 --> 02:31:13,540
Because...

2034
02:31:13,540 --> 02:31:18,380
unless there's like a strap-on attachment to play, it wouldn't be any fun.

2035
02:31:18,380 --> 02:31:22,040
so next

2036
02:31:22,040 --> 02:31:26,420

02:31:26,420 --> 02:31:28,860
mocap mud wrestling

2038
02:31:28,860 --> 02:31:31,980
how could you really motion capture that though

2039
02:31:31,980 --> 02:31:35,300

02:31:35,300 --> 02:31:40,540

just because

2075
02:33:19,640 --> 02:33:23,040
just because that's kind of what part of the reason why is kinda like dancing so

2076
02:33:23,040 --> 02:33:30,040
so they already have it as far as i can see otherwise there

2077
02:33:41,380 --> 02:33:43,240
anyway that there

2078
02:33:43,240 --> 02:33:46,840

2079
02:33:46,840 --> 02:33:48,480

2080
02:33:48,480 --> 02:33:52,760

2099
02:34:51,120 --> 02:34:52,120
he leaves.

2100

2101
02:34:56,440 --> 02:34:57,720

Party after party, beauty and money

2154
02:41:13,300 --> 02:41:15,300
I closed my eyes

2155
02:41:15,300 --> 02:41:19,300

Alright, so, now we're going to do, we're going to Ask Orange Lounge, we're going to close out this with a couple quick questions for Ask Orange Lounge.

2174
02:42:59,060 --> 02:43:01,060
Yeah, let's do Ask Orange Lounge.

Send your question over private message to DarkSakura, remember we have a ton of guests in studio tonight.

2177
02:43:08,060 --> 02:43:12,060
By the way, by the way, bad grammar, it's not should of, it should have.

2178
02:43:12,060 --> 02:43:14,060
Hey, you're guilty of that too!

2179
02:43:14,060 --> 02:43:16,060
I am, so what?

2180
02:43:16,060 --> 02:43:21,220
You still knew what I was saying. Hey, I went off on that on one of my fuckies of the week.

2181
02:43:21,220 --> 02:43:25,620
Where? Well, let's see if we have our first question. Here's a big

2182
02:43:25,620 --> 02:43:30,520
ball of Kleenex just for you, dear. First question comes from

2183
02:43:30,520 --> 02:43:33,740
Maneki Neko Jass. Oh, yay! Are you gay?

2184
02:43:33,740 --> 02:43:38,140
Are you gay? If you scream, you call,

2185
02:43:38,140 --> 02:43:42,700
you gay. So, wait, are we gonna go around and find out who's gay? Is he directing that one

2186
02:43:42,700 --> 02:43:43,540
person, or...

2187
02:43:43,540 --> 02:43:45,540
Is this a Margaret Cho quote?

2188
02:43:45,540 --> 02:43:47,540
Oh, it's just a Margaret Cho quote?

2189
02:43:47,540 --> 02:43:48,540
Are you gay?

2190
02:43:48,540 --> 02:43:50,540
Oh, well then, if it's not a real question, forget it.

2191
02:43:50,540 --> 02:43:53,540
I have a response to that. I actually have a response to that.

2192
02:43:55,540 --> 02:43:57,540
Oh, wait, I'm sorry.

2193
02:43:57,540 --> 02:44:01,540
Mommy think everybody little bit gay.

2194
02:44:08,540 --> 02:44:10,540
I don't know, I like boobs sometimes.

2195
02:44:10,540 --> 02:44:12,540
I'm a lesbian trapped in a man's body.

2196
02:44:12,540 --> 02:44:16,500
yeah how many times we've heard that one before we're you gonna play a response

2197
02:44:16,500 --> 02:44:20,820
to that or yeah okay all right then let's hear it

2198
02:44:20,820 --> 02:44:27,980
I inherited my father's eyes and my mother's on one

2199
02:44:32,300 --> 02:44:35,740
I'll eat pussy

2200
02:44:35,740 --> 02:44:45,420
It's just not my first choice.

2201
02:44:45,420 --> 02:44:51,380
I'll eat pussy if they run out of what I really want.

2202
02:44:51,380 --> 02:44:55,060
Interesting, okay.

2203
02:44:55,060 --> 02:44:56,060
Moving on.

2204
02:44:56,060 --> 02:44:58,260
The next question comes from JB.

2205
02:44:58,260 --> 02:45:01,900
When will my sci-fem CD get here?

2206
02:45:01,900 --> 02:45:02,900
That's great grammar.

2207
02:45:02,900 --> 02:45:03,900
You get to criticize him about that too?

2208
02:45:03,900 --> 02:45:06,020
No, I said, when will my second CD get here?

2209
02:45:06,020 --> 02:45:07,340
Oh, I thought you said gets here.

2210
02:45:07,340 --> 02:45:08,260
I was coughing.

2211
02:45:08,260 --> 02:45:08,760
Oh, OK.

2212
02:45:11,500 --> 02:45:18,300
It will get here on next Thursday.

2213
02:45:18,300 --> 02:45:20,660
Oh, let's see if Rob's right.

2214
02:45:20,660 --> 02:45:22,900
Our next one comes from Japan Man.

2215
02:45:22,900 --> 02:45:24,820
Anyone looking for a good time?

2216
02:45:24,820 --> 02:45:25,320
Yes.

2217
02:45:25,320 --> 02:45:25,820
Not from you.

2218
02:45:25,820 --> 02:45:27,060
That's why we're here.

2219
02:45:27,060 --> 02:45:28,780
That's why we're here.

2220
02:45:28,780 --> 02:45:29,820
That's a very good answer.

2221
02:45:29,820 --> 02:45:31,440
Do you have a phone number we can call?

2222
02:45:31,440 --> 02:45:32,900
Hey, baby.

2223
02:45:32,900 --> 02:45:38,740
By the way, just between you and me, that's what I'm aiming for for season 3, is the debut

2224
02:45:38,740 --> 02:45:39,740
of the phones.

2225
02:45:39,740 --> 02:45:40,740
Yes.

2226
02:45:40,740 --> 02:45:41,740
Woohoo!

2227
02:45:41,740 --> 02:45:45,160
So when Loki and I move into, because then we'll be able to dedicate a home line, because,

2228
02:45:45,160 --> 02:45:49,820
you know, who cares if Orange Lounge people are calling during the middle of the day?

2229
02:45:49,820 --> 02:45:54,680
The next question comes from 23rd Bank, it's actually for DarkTetia.

2230
02:45:54,680 --> 02:45:59,340
I never asked you if you had to collide Japanese girls in a bucket of chocolate ready whip,

2231
02:45:59,340 --> 02:46:00,340
what would you do?

2232
02:46:00,340 --> 02:46:03,940
Oh my god, I don't know.

2233
02:46:03,940 --> 02:46:09,740
Yeah. What would I not do? That's a good one.

2234
02:46:09,740 --> 02:46:16,580
Our next question comes from Chubbs. Will you be hosting Orange Downs Radio during March Madness, and can I be a guest?

2235
02:46:16,580 --> 02:46:20,060
Yes and yes. When's your next junk show?

2236
02:46:20,060 --> 02:46:24,300
When we have a three-day weekend? Um, probably the Saturday night...

2237
02:46:24,300 --> 02:46:28,620
I got it! I got it! Sunday night after March Madness! Oh, that's right, because you and me have Monday off!

2238
02:46:28,620 --> 02:46:32,420
drunk you and me well the thing is okay this is the interesting thing in two

2239
02:46:32,420 --> 02:46:37,980
weeks orange lounge will be preempted by the live running coverage of March

2240
02:46:37,980 --> 02:46:40,940
madness please help us spread the promotion we want this to be a huge

2241
02:46:40,940 --> 02:46:44,820
internet event we know a lot of you guys aren't in California we know a lot of

2242
02:46:44,820 --> 02:46:48,300
times this show is kind of very localized to California events and stuff

2243
02:46:48,300 --> 02:46:50,900
but if you guys want to get in on this those of you abroad we know we have a

2244
02:46:50,900 --> 02:46:55,420
lot of listeners out on the East Coast Midwest if you want to get in on this

2245
02:46:55,420 --> 02:47:05,420
Listen to our live tournament coverage. It's going to go all day long, and it's just for you guys who are far away, because we figure most people from California are going to be here at the tournament. You'll get to hear everybody.

2246
02:47:05,420 --> 02:47:09,420
And our next trunk show is probably going to be right after that, because we're going to be like, fuck this and get drunk.

2247
02:47:09,420 --> 02:47:14,420
We will probably do a live fuck-off show immediately following the March Madness coverage.

2248
02:47:14,420 --> 02:47:21,420
Well, our next question comes from SkylineDC505. It says, will I pass my drive test this Thursday? Sure.

2249
02:47:21,420 --> 02:47:24,320
I you will pass it with an 80 like I did

2250
02:47:24,920 --> 02:47:26,560
It was the fee

2251
02:47:26,560 --> 02:47:32,640
What type of questions can ask people to make them think I'm interested? I'm sorry. What was it? What type of questions?

2252
02:47:32,640 --> 02:47:34,640
Can I ask people to make them think I'm interested?

2253
02:47:35,640 --> 02:47:37,720
What color panties are you wearing? I?

2254
02:47:39,080 --> 02:47:41,080
Like peanut butter what a fuck

2255
02:47:41,240 --> 02:47:47,720
There you go. That's a great question. Yes, I like peanut butter. Do you want to fuck question mark?

2256
02:47:47,720 --> 02:47:54,720
More Than Jake asks, why won't anybody pick up the phone, because we're not there?

2257
02:47:55,720 --> 02:47:57,720
Send an email, welcome to the new millennium, hi.

2258
02:47:57,720 --> 02:48:01,720
23rd Magus, have any of you actually called 867-5309?

2259
02:48:01,720 --> 02:48:03,720
No, I never have.

2260
02:48:03,720 --> 02:48:04,720
Everybody in their lives?

2261
02:48:04,720 --> 02:48:11,720
But I have called, hey for those of you local in Sacramento in the 916 area code, I have called 332-2222.

2262
02:48:11,720 --> 02:48:13,720
That's all I'm going to say.

2263
02:48:13,720 --> 02:48:20,320
I'll have you know that actually because of that song right there. That's why in every single movie all the phone numbers are five five five

2264
02:48:21,400 --> 02:48:22,920
Yes

2265
02:48:22,920 --> 02:48:28,880
Because five five five no one can have a number with that on it because those are dedicated

2266
02:48:29,080 --> 02:48:34,960
Straight for like the movies and stuff because people like that call that number and in some guy just got knowing

2267
02:48:35,560 --> 02:48:40,560
Totally pissed off at that. You know yeah, I mean really don't you guys watch pop-up video. They said it like 80 times now

2268
02:48:40,560 --> 02:48:44,840
actually I believe if any of you saw the movie punch drunk love

2269
02:48:44,840 --> 02:48:48,000
there's a scene where Adam Sandler's calling like a porn sex line or something and they

2270
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:49,240
use like a real number

2271
02:48:49,240 --> 02:48:53,160
what they did is that Hollywood bought like that 800 number and then like put

2272
02:48:53,160 --> 02:48:54,640
an advertisement for the movie on it

2273
02:48:54,640 --> 02:49:00,720
so that's kinda funny. JB asks can I talk on the order of March Madness I will hypnotize you I will

2274
02:49:00,720 --> 02:49:02,000
stife him talk more hahaha

2275
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:05,300
yes any okay this is the interesting thing

2276
02:49:05,300 --> 02:49:09,120
if March Madness gets set up like we hope it does

2277
02:49:09,120 --> 02:49:12,720
we're not gonna be like tucked away in the corner like way the back we will be

2278
02:49:12,720 --> 02:49:13,360
able to see us

2279
02:49:13,360 --> 02:49:17,280
we're hoping that we're gonna have if if the tourney is outdoors like we're

2280
02:49:17,280 --> 02:49:19,160
thinking it's going to be provided it's not raining

2281
02:49:19,160 --> 02:49:22,660
we're hoping that the gazebo is going to be orange lounge and if any of you have been to

2282
02:49:22,660 --> 02:49:25,600
Scandia and see the gazebo out back it's huge you won't miss us

2283
02:49:25,600 --> 02:49:28,920
so come on by it's gonna be open open door all day so

2284
02:49:28,920 --> 02:49:32,720
nobody else needs to ask that yes you can be on the show just come on by and say hi

2285
02:49:32,720 --> 02:49:36,720
will you guys be here in the summer for CBN too so can I be a guest that's from Rice?

2286
02:49:36,720 --> 02:49:46,720
Give me some dates, as long as I can afford it. I don't see why not. Yeah, I have not heard anything about CBN2.

2287
02:49:46,720 --> 02:49:56,720
Because we already know there's going to be B3 May 17th and 18th, and definitely going to be there, so you should be there too.

2288
02:49:56,720 --> 02:50:12,720
May is a little before summer, though. I imagine Cyberbeat, they wouldn't want to do that more than twice a year, if even that, so I would think that January, probably July would be the earliest they'd want to do that. So, I don't know. Give us dates, we'll see.

2289
02:50:12,720 --> 02:50:19,920
and another one from a jazz what are each of our favorite extreme songs first

2290
02:50:19,920 --> 02:50:25,260
and I don't really play extreme that much but and and because I would

2291
02:50:25,260 --> 02:50:29,900
normally name anything that tack does I'm actually gonna go with guacamole del

2292
02:50:29,900 --> 02:50:37,320
taco contrary to what a lot of people see me play I actually seem to like be

2293
02:50:37,320 --> 02:50:44,320
a lot more than I put on. I always play A on doubles only because the steps are fun.

2294
02:50:49,200 --> 02:50:53,840
And people like watching you run around the pad really fast. They're like, ooh, arrows

2295
02:50:53,840 --> 02:51:00,840
going up the screen

2296
02:51:02,920 --> 02:51:06,980
okay and so what's the make a comment on

2297
02:51:06,980 --> 02:51:09,920

02:51:24,700 --> 02:51:27,040
i love it

2304
02:51:27,040 --> 02:51:30,380
it's like

2305
02:51:30,380 --> 02:51:31,760
uh...

2306
02:51:31,760 --> 02:51:33,460
i'm stuck between

2307
02:51:33,460 --> 02:51:35,100
mobile again

2308
02:51:35,100 --> 02:51:38,280
uh...

2309
02:51:38,280 --> 02:51:40,460
evictions

2310
02:51:40,460 --> 02:51:42,300
rhythm police of those days

2311
02:51:42,300 --> 02:51:43,700
rule

2312
02:51:43,700 --> 02:51:45,460
you pick sides

2313
02:51:45,460 --> 02:51:47,180
uh... i

2314
02:51:47,180 --> 02:51:50,720
I'm gonna call me Fag, but I do, I do, I do. I love that song.

2315
02:51:50,720 --> 02:51:52,920
Fag?

2316
02:51:52,920 --> 02:51:55,160
He said so!

2317
02:51:55,160 --> 02:51:59,600
Okay, and Rob, can he stay at your house with your mic?

2318
02:51:59,600 --> 02:52:03,720
Uh, I think so, yeah, I still haven't run that by Brian for sure, but I have told

2319
02:52:03,720 --> 02:52:06,560
him there is a tournament and people will probably be here.

2320
02:52:06,560 --> 02:52:10,360
Yeah, I'm pretty sure, let's just say yes, if there's a change that I'll let you know.

2321
02:52:10,360 --> 02:52:15,380
And then... He's pretty cool with stuff like that. If he wants to know if I can legally become his cousin,

2322
02:52:15,380 --> 02:52:17,180
We could try.

2323
02:52:17,180 --> 02:52:18,500
I'm adopting you anyway, so...

2324
02:52:18,500 --> 02:52:22,260
Interesting. How would that work?

2325
02:52:22,260 --> 02:52:24,780
Your aunt would have to adopt me.

2326
02:52:24,780 --> 02:52:28,900
What about, could your aunt adopt him? Do you have an aunt?

2327
02:52:28,900 --> 02:52:30,340
I have a bunch of aunts, but...

2328
02:52:30,340 --> 02:52:33,660
Could one of them, you don't want them to adopt J.B.? You'd rather be adopted by J.B.

2329
02:52:33,660 --> 02:52:37,820
I'm scared of my family, so...

2330
02:52:37,820 --> 02:52:39,420
Okay, so you'll try.

2331
02:52:39,420 --> 02:52:42,700
Maybe, maybe you can go on the People's Court and make that happen.

2332
02:52:42,700 --> 02:52:46,140
Let's go to people's court and have them legally make us cousins.

2333
02:52:46,140 --> 02:52:49,700
This is the plaintiff.

2334
02:52:49,700 --> 02:52:51,180
And then...

2335
02:52:51,180 --> 02:52:58,180
And then, can I kill A.T.T. Comcast? No, A.T.T. can go, but Comcast is actually doing good service for me.

2336
02:52:58,580 --> 02:53:00,620
You can come over here and use my cable.

2337
02:53:00,620 --> 02:53:01,980
23 Megas.

2338
02:53:01,980 --> 02:53:05,520
Can I put a big sign on the gazebo that says Orange Doms Temple of Butt?

2339
02:53:05,520 --> 02:53:06,500
No.

2340
02:53:06,500 --> 02:53:09,900
No, because it's Scandia Family Fun Center.

2341
02:53:09,900 --> 02:53:12,900
If we shake hands at marshmallows, does that make one of us outface?

2342
02:53:12,900 --> 02:53:16,900
And that's the DT.

2343
02:53:16,900 --> 02:53:18,900
Um, no.

2344
02:53:18,900 --> 02:53:20,900
Yeah, sure.

2345
02:53:20,900 --> 02:53:23,900
Ask us more questions, we have one more minute.

2346
02:53:23,900 --> 02:53:25,900
Waste time, waste time, waste time.

2347
02:53:25,900 --> 02:53:31,900
Does anybody in the room have a question for anyone else that they want to ask live on air?

2348
02:53:31,900 --> 02:53:34,900
I didn't mean to say that, but yeah.

2349
02:53:34,900 --> 02:53:36,900
I was answering a question, yeah.

2350
02:53:36,900 --> 02:53:38,900
That's why I said the evil name.

2351
02:53:38,900 --> 02:53:42,520
hey we have question from Japan and yay

2352
02:53:42,520 --> 02:54:07,420

Japan Man. Back to Japan Man.

2354
02:54:11,420 --> 02:54:15,420
Does 1, 2, 3, 4 Max 300's owner suck?

2355
02:54:15,420 --> 02:54:19,420
Really? Bad. Awful piece of shit.

2356
02:54:19,420 --> 02:54:20,420
It was created in the Temple of Butt.

2357
02:54:20,420 --> 02:54:22,420
Worse than T-word.

2358
02:54:22,420 --> 02:54:23,420

2359
02:54:23,420 --> 02:54:25,420

You know what? That does it.

2373
02:55:03,820 --> 02:55:05,820
Let's get to the last question. We'll cut it off.

2374
02:55:05,820 --> 02:55:07,820
Oh, we'll get to the last question.

2375
02:55:07,820 --> 02:55:09,820
Then I don't know. It was just a moment.

2376
02:55:09,820 --> 02:55:11,820
Are you in joy?

2377
02:55:11,820 --> 02:55:13,820
Yes.

2378
02:55:13,820 --> 02:55:15,820
Are we in joy?

2379
02:55:15,820 --> 02:55:17,820
Final thoughts? Time.

2380
02:55:17,820 --> 02:55:19,820
Final thoughts?

2381
02:55:19,820 --> 02:55:21,820
I'm still going to play that song anyway.

2382
02:55:21,820 --> 02:55:25,820
Don't fall down and hurt yourself.

2383
02:55:25,820 --> 02:55:27,820
I don't have any.

2384
02:55:27,820 --> 02:55:29,820
I'm sorry. I don't have any.

2385
02:55:29,820 --> 02:55:31,820
How about you?

2386
02:55:31,820 --> 02:55:36,820
I have to go homework on my website and my anime ezine that I have to do for my work.

2387
02:55:36,820 --> 02:55:42,820
Full peanut butter cups are harder to throw than just wrappers.

2388
02:55:42,820 --> 02:55:46,820
I have to go to work tomorrow and I really don't want to.

2389
02:55:46,820 --> 02:55:54,820
I don't know nothing.

2390
02:55:54,820 --> 02:55:58,820
If you ever go to Chico, beware the sheep, they're all sluts.

2391
02:55:58,820 --> 02:56:02,820
