1
00:00:04,993 --> 00:00:08,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

2
00:00:10,518 --> 00:00:15,562
[SPEAKER_25]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

3
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,981
[SPEAKER_25]: Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

4
00:00:22,302 --> 00:00:25,484
[SPEAKER_25]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

5
00:00:26,065 --> 00:00:28,787
[SPEAKER_25]: Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

6
00:00:29,327 --> 00:00:32,230
[SPEAKER_25]: Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

7
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,451
[SPEAKER_17]: Just kidding.

8
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:35,232
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

9
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:42,898
[SPEAKER_30]: In this episode... Hey, is there any balls down there?

10
00:00:43,058 --> 00:00:45,660
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the biggest bear you've ever seen, Jingleberry.

11
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,442
[SPEAKER_11]: What's your favorite scary movie?

12
00:00:48,928 --> 00:00:49,488
[SPEAKER_31]: Showgirls.

13
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:51,550
[SPEAKER_31]: Absolutely frightening.

14
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:52,611
[SPEAKER_31]: What's yours?

15
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:55,093
[SPEAKER_31]: There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

16
00:00:55,153 --> 00:00:57,034
[SPEAKER_31]: Don't torture yourself.

17
00:00:57,054 --> 00:00:57,855
[SPEAKER_31]: That's my job.

18
00:00:58,055 --> 00:00:59,796
[SPEAKER_31]: Now's the time when Sprockets made me dogs!

19
00:00:59,876 --> 00:01:02,939
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll get you, my pretty.

20
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:04,520
[SPEAKER_07]: And your little dog, too.

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,801
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Kung Fu.

22
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:08,583
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

23
00:01:08,843 --> 00:01:10,685
[SPEAKER_31]: Why did they have to take the word gay?

24
00:01:12,326 --> 00:01:14,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody expects us to punish acquisitions.

25
00:01:15,248 --> 00:01:16,089
[SPEAKER_07]: It's handover.

26
00:01:18,922 --> 00:01:20,722
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura Shut up!

27
00:01:20,902 --> 00:01:21,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's my gun?

28
00:01:21,723 --> 00:01:23,683
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my boom stick!

29
00:01:24,163 --> 00:01:26,684
[SPEAKER_18]: Sky Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!

30
00:01:26,944 --> 00:01:30,685
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.

31
00:01:30,745 --> 00:01:33,565
[SPEAKER_12]: What kind of warping being would find that funny?

32
00:01:33,805 --> 00:01:42,107
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge Radio We are live and this is episode number 36 for March 9th of 2003.

[SPEAKER_17]: Tech Master?

42
00:02:06,676 --> 00:02:07,837
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I need to change the title.

43
00:02:08,877 --> 00:02:09,298
[SPEAKER_24]: Like what?

44
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:14,060

00:02:19,029 --> 00:02:19,669
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, where's our intern?

48
00:02:19,729 --> 00:02:22,069
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody say hello to the asshole, Loki!

49
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,830
[SPEAKER_17]: That'll do.

00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,290
[SPEAKER_17]: How are you today, asshole Loki?

51
00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:28,451
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm fine.

52
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:32,111

53
00:02:33,012 --> 00:02:35,352
[SPEAKER_21]: I am not Orange Launch's bitch.

00:02:38,213 --> 00:02:38,353
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

56
00:02:39,053 --> 00:02:39,813
[SPEAKER_17]: Like interns do.

57
00:02:41,973 --> 00:02:42,294
[SPEAKER_18]: Never mind.

58
00:02:42,314 --> 00:02:44,214
[SPEAKER_18]: I was going to be mean, but never mind.

59
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:45,671
[SPEAKER_17]: Be mean!

[SPEAKER_17]: How are you doing?

65
00:02:55,817 --> 00:02:56,498
[SPEAKER_17]: How are you, gentlemen?

66
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:57,498
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

67
00:02:57,999 --> 00:02:58,619
[SPEAKER_17]: How's your week been?

68
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:01,541
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, just waiting on my FUs.

69
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:08,725
[SPEAKER_17]: Wait a minute, it's been about, well, I don't know, probably about 25 weeks since we've had you on the show, so how's the past, like, four months been?

70
00:03:09,826 --> 00:03:11,587
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, well, long story.

71
00:03:11,947 --> 00:03:13,048
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, fair enough.

72
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:14,529
[SPEAKER_18]: Also with us...

73
00:03:18,217 --> 00:03:19,438
[SPEAKER_18]: 25 weeks on the show.

74
00:03:19,738 --> 00:03:22,939
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's about, I don't know, six months?

75
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,480
[SPEAKER_17]: I can do math.

76
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,441
[SPEAKER_17]: This is what happens when you drop out of college.

77
00:03:30,481 --> 00:03:31,021
[SPEAKER_17]: Stay in school.

78
00:03:31,081 --> 00:03:31,381
[SPEAKER_17]: Be cool.

79
00:03:31,641 --> 00:03:31,901
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

80
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:34,902
[SPEAKER_17]: And also with us tonight, say hello to Sunya Bunya.

81
00:03:35,222 --> 00:03:35,622
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi.

82
00:03:36,242 --> 00:03:36,582
[SPEAKER_17]: How are you?

83
00:03:36,602 --> 00:03:37,623
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm okay.

84
00:03:37,683 --> 00:03:38,543
[SPEAKER_17]: Did I pronounce that okay?

85
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,361
[SPEAKER_17]: Soonja, Soonja Boonja.

86
00:03:42,001 --> 00:03:44,122
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanted to make it rhyme with Boonya, so I said Soonja.

87
00:03:46,302 --> 00:03:49,664
[SPEAKER_17]: And Bombay, I called him by his nickname tonight so he wouldn't cut me.

88
00:03:49,884 --> 00:03:50,704
[SPEAKER_20]: Good job.

89
00:03:50,984 --> 00:03:51,404
[SPEAKER_17]: How are you?

90
00:03:51,544 --> 00:03:52,165
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate it.

91
00:03:52,325 --> 00:03:53,385
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm doing okay.

92
00:03:53,405 --> 00:03:56,266
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm a little tired from Scandia, but other than that, I'm pretty good.

93
00:03:57,047 --> 00:03:58,287
[SPEAKER_20]: I see you're wearing your uniform.

94
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,808
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I just got off about two hours ago.

95
00:04:01,188 --> 00:04:03,269
[SPEAKER_17]: Very nice.

96
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:04,730
[SPEAKER_17]: Jamie said you got off.

97
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,711
[SPEAKER_17]: Also with us, say hello to Puppy.

98
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:08,091
[SPEAKER_17]: Woof.

99
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:09,547
[SPEAKER_17]: How are you?

100
00:04:09,748 --> 00:04:11,169
[SPEAKER_17]: You just came from downstairs.

101
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:12,090
[SPEAKER_17]: You were playing Animal Crack.

102
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:12,530
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

103
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,391
[SPEAKER_17]: Killing roaches.

104
00:04:13,411 --> 00:04:14,732
[SPEAKER_17]: Because you haven't played in about a month.

105
00:04:14,752 --> 00:04:15,873
[SPEAKER_19]: There's like tons of them.

106
00:04:16,794 --> 00:04:18,936
[SPEAKER_19]: I know, but there's like tons of them.

107
00:04:19,256 --> 00:04:20,297
[SPEAKER_19]: I killed 20 so far.

108
00:04:21,057 --> 00:04:24,480
[SPEAKER_19]: The last time you played Animal Crossing was when Joe was on this show last, I think.

109
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,323
[SPEAKER_19]: No, it was like a month ago.

110
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,084
[SPEAKER_24]: Did you like what I did with your house?

111
00:04:29,545 --> 00:04:32,768
[SPEAKER_24]: I gave you matching floor and wall and some furniture that went with that set.

112
00:04:32,868 --> 00:04:33,708
[SPEAKER_24]: It's the Kadana set.

113
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,757
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like trading spaces.

114
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:39,279
[SPEAKER_19]: Anybody ever watch that shit?

115
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,200
[SPEAKER_19]: My mom watches that.

116
00:04:43,982 --> 00:04:46,924
[SPEAKER_18]: They have the best of season one of that stupid show on DVD now.

117
00:04:47,424 --> 00:04:47,824
[SPEAKER_18]: Sad.

118
00:04:49,465 --> 00:04:51,206
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm waiting for the Gay Weddings DVD.

119
00:04:51,326 --> 00:04:52,207
[SPEAKER_17]: That shows the shit.

120
00:04:52,747 --> 00:04:53,108
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

121
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:56,109
[SPEAKER_17]: We're giving a shout-out.

122
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:56,550
[SPEAKER_17]: Shout-out.

123
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,951
[SPEAKER_17]: Do shout-outs, Jamie.

124
00:04:59,392 --> 00:04:59,792
[SPEAKER_24]: Yo!

125
00:05:00,392 --> 00:05:02,974
[SPEAKER_24]: All you people who want shout-outs, yo, I'm just not gonna name anybody.

126
00:05:04,175 --> 00:05:04,375
[SPEAKER_24]: Yo.

127
00:05:05,655 --> 00:05:06,175
[SPEAKER_17]: What's up?

128
00:05:06,536 --> 00:05:07,176
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

129
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:09,318
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello to our chat room.

130
00:05:09,358 --> 00:05:13,321
[SPEAKER_17]: If you want to join our chat room, go to orangelounge.skie.cx and click on chat.

131
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:17,884
[SPEAKER_17]: And then you should also post in our forums, because our forums have been kind of dead, and we need people to post in them.

132
00:05:18,105 --> 00:05:20,046
[SPEAKER_24]: Not in the quote forum, my God.

133
00:05:20,106 --> 00:05:21,167
[SPEAKER_17]: No, not the quote forum.

134
00:05:21,327 --> 00:05:22,648
[SPEAKER_17]: Whoa, but everything else has been dead.

135
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:25,490
[SPEAKER_17]: So we need people to go there and post love letters, if you wouldn't mind.

136
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:27,992
[SPEAKER_17]: I need a lot of attention, and so does Jamie.

137
00:05:28,032 --> 00:05:32,055
[SPEAKER_17]: Jamie likes attention, so go post your love and affection letters to Jamie.

138
00:05:32,075 --> 00:05:34,297
[SPEAKER_17]: And then Loki, tell him what a dick he is.

139
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:35,198
[SPEAKER_14]: Jerk.

140
00:05:37,054 --> 00:05:41,959
[SPEAKER_17]: Tell him you don't appreciate those racial slurs and homophobic comments, and what else has he said on this show, Nox?

141
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:43,501
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, you porn monger, you.

142
00:05:44,341 --> 00:05:44,922
[SPEAKER_24]: The hell?

143
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:51,068
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm like totally opposite from everyone perceiving me as, like some crazy racist guy out there.

144
00:05:51,388 --> 00:05:55,052
[SPEAKER_18]: I should just like shave my head, join the Ku Klux Klan and shit, man.

145
00:05:56,293 --> 00:05:57,254
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what the problem is.

146
00:05:59,577 --> 00:06:00,718
[SPEAKER_17]: You were saying, Loki?

147
00:06:02,131 --> 00:06:04,393
[SPEAKER_17]: All I have to say is you should have been there last night.

148
00:06:04,413 --> 00:06:06,134
[SPEAKER_17]: We were playing this game, loaded questions.

149
00:06:06,915 --> 00:06:08,476
[SPEAKER_17]: And Brad had to answer this question.

150
00:06:08,516 --> 00:06:11,238
[SPEAKER_17]: What's the problem that you would fix in America?

151
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,442
[SPEAKER_17]: And he said, well, we should get rid of all the... I'll just leave the rest to your imagination.

152
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:17,023
[SPEAKER_17]: But he got a lot of stuff thrown at him.

153
00:06:18,204 --> 00:06:18,564
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

154
00:06:18,684 --> 00:06:20,426
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that's when I was sort of passing out.

155
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:22,247
[SPEAKER_17]: Deprivation and alcohol.

156
00:06:22,267 --> 00:06:23,028
[SPEAKER_17]: You had a lot to drink.

157
00:06:23,068 --> 00:06:24,429
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll talk about drinking when we get back.

158
00:06:24,489 --> 00:06:25,610
[SPEAKER_24]: I didn't have a lot to drink.

159
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,230
[SPEAKER_17]: I was just tired.

160
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,491
[SPEAKER_17]: That stuff's pretty strong.

161
00:06:27,511 --> 00:06:28,392
[SPEAKER_24]: That stuff was weak.

162
00:06:29,042 --> 00:06:30,243
[SPEAKER_21]: No, you want to know what's worse than writing it?

163
00:06:30,263 --> 00:06:33,065
[SPEAKER_24]: You had, what, three shots and you were giggling on the floor rolling around?

164
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:35,688
[SPEAKER_24]: I threw, like, stuff at you and you didn't move.

165
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:36,668
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have to be drunk to do that.

166
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:38,430
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have to be drunk to do that.

167
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,071
[SPEAKER_21]: You put peanut butter cups on your head, too.

168
00:06:40,612 --> 00:06:41,393
[SPEAKER_24]: I put one in your ear.

169
00:06:41,673 --> 00:06:42,594
[SPEAKER_21]: No, wait, wait, hold on.

170
00:06:42,634 --> 00:06:43,394
[SPEAKER_21]: I got one thing to say.

171
00:06:43,414 --> 00:06:45,436
[SPEAKER_21]: You want to know what's worse than writing what was read?

172
00:06:46,177 --> 00:06:52,462
[SPEAKER_21]: Writing what was written was being the one who had to read it out loud and being afraid everyone's going to attack you instead of the person who wrote it.

173
00:06:53,592 --> 00:06:54,513
[SPEAKER_17]: Because everyone knew who wrote it.

174
00:06:55,274 --> 00:06:59,239
[SPEAKER_17]: And then somebody said, who tried to balance this bottle of Smirnoff Black on me while I was sleeping?

175
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:00,019
[SPEAKER_17]: Was that you?

176
00:07:04,344 --> 00:07:04,985
[SPEAKER_17]: That wasn't fun.

177
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:08,069
[SPEAKER_17]: Can we go to break now?

178
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:08,770
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, bye.

179
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:09,951
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll be back.

180
00:07:14,378 --> 00:07:22,341
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I guess we're going to do one more, because I got these much better parody lyrics for Bumblebee than that shit I did a little bit ago, so we're going to do this one instead.

181
00:07:22,361 --> 00:07:26,342
[SPEAKER_17]: This comes from DDR Angel and Stress, this is much better, so enjoy.

182
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:31,063
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I'm going to fuck this up, I apologize.

183
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:31,304
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck you.

184
00:07:31,324 --> 00:07:31,584
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck you.

185
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:47,341
[SPEAKER_11]: Sweet little bumblebee Get the fuck away from me Sweet little bumblebee

186
00:07:58,405 --> 00:08:22,320
[SPEAKER_11]: My foot kicks your ass when you walk in the room I go boom, boom, boom, you go zoom, zoom, zoom You're my format, dance pad, killable friend I wanna kick your ass until you're dead I'll shove my foot right up your ass To help you see it's true I don't like you, can't you see?

187
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Now get the fuck away from me

188
00:08:26,454 --> 00:08:26,994
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck you!

189
00:08:58,681 --> 00:08:58,922
What?

190
00:13:17,702 --> 00:13:23,846
[SPEAKER_23]: with Orange Lounge Radio with the Ping Pong Boys.

191
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:28,349
[SPEAKER_24]: Yay, we're back.

192
00:13:28,629 --> 00:13:29,530
[SPEAKER_17]: Yay, we are back.

193
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,530
[SPEAKER_24]: Did you miss us?

194
00:13:31,251 --> 00:13:32,071
[SPEAKER_17]: Bork, bork, bork.

195
00:13:32,392 --> 00:13:35,794
[SPEAKER_24]: No, for that break we had Bumblebee's Sky's Wizard Mixer.

196
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,655
[SPEAKER_24]: Just for the fact that I wanted to annoy Rob with it.

197
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:41,217
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, by the way, Jamie, for embarrassing me because I had no idea she was going to be playing.

198
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:53,792
[SPEAKER_17]: And surprisingly enough, a lot of people in the chatroom have not heard that before And a lot of people want to get an mp3 of that I'm not sure I should be advertising this I find that thing quite embarrassing I don't know why you guys like it so much Who wants it?

199
00:13:53,812 --> 00:14:05,336
[SPEAKER_17]: PM me No, I'll tell you I'll tell you what, even better Talk to Stressa I don't know if he's awake right now or active in chat I'm not sure I can't really see the chatroom from where I'm sitting Jamie's in the chat tonight

200
00:14:05,876 --> 00:14:06,697
[SPEAKER_17]: RobEatingPussy

201
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,080
[SPEAKER_17]: Ew.

202
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:24,802
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead, Jeremy.

203
00:14:26,143 --> 00:14:29,245
[SPEAKER_17]: If you want DWIs, go and ask Dressa.

204
00:14:29,806 --> 00:14:30,386
[SPEAKER_17]: Is he in chat?

205
00:14:30,406 --> 00:14:31,747
[SPEAKER_17]: He's not even in chat right now, is he?

206
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:32,108
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

207
00:14:32,148 --> 00:14:32,808
[SPEAKER_17]: So I guess he's out.

208
00:14:33,088 --> 00:14:35,030
[SPEAKER_17]: But when he's around, ask him about it.

209
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,292
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think some other folks might have it.

210
00:14:38,072 --> 00:14:40,474
[SPEAKER_17]: DDR Angel, I know, has it, but she's on vacation right now.

211
00:14:40,494 --> 00:14:41,175
[SPEAKER_17]: She's in Japan.

212
00:14:41,195 --> 00:14:41,575
[SPEAKER_17]: Japan.

213
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,597
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll find a way for you folks to get it.

214
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:45,798
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure Loki will put it up.

215
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,860
[SPEAKER_17]: Speaking of DWIs and Loki...

216
00:14:50,117 --> 00:14:51,878
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm eating fucking pretzels right now, man.

217
00:14:52,218 --> 00:14:53,258
[SPEAKER_17]: Ooh, his mouth is full.

218
00:14:53,338 --> 00:14:53,858
[SPEAKER_17]: My bad.

219
00:14:54,438 --> 00:14:55,439
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, how was your week, Jamie?

220
00:14:55,499 --> 00:14:56,119
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll get back to that.

221
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:58,940
[SPEAKER_17]: How was... Is everybody going to eat?

222
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,901
[SPEAKER_17]: So I have to just sit here and just talk to myself.

223
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:01,641
[SPEAKER_17]: How are you, Zero?

224
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:02,821
[SPEAKER_17]: Fine.

225
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:03,901
[SPEAKER_24]: I have new horses.

226
00:15:04,382 --> 00:15:04,882
[SPEAKER_17]: You have new horses?

227
00:15:04,962 --> 00:15:06,322
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, let's talk about yesterday's trip.

228
00:15:06,342 --> 00:15:06,842
[SPEAKER_17]: That was fun.

229
00:15:07,002 --> 00:15:08,163
[SPEAKER_17]: That was fun.

230
00:15:08,523 --> 00:15:10,003
[SPEAKER_24]: To go play Derby Owner's Crack.

231
00:15:10,063 --> 00:15:10,364
[SPEAKER_17]: Mm-hmm.

232
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:11,404
[SPEAKER_24]: Um...

233
00:15:12,592 --> 00:15:18,158
[SPEAKER_17]: For those that don't know what Derby Owner's Crack is, it's a game where you race horsies, and it's a lot of fun.

234
00:15:18,878 --> 00:15:20,660
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like Initial D, but horses.

235
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,783
[SPEAKER_17]: But you don't actually ride the horses like you drive the car.

236
00:15:24,043 --> 00:15:24,724
[SPEAKER_17]: You just whip them.

237
00:15:24,764 --> 00:15:28,327
[SPEAKER_17]: You have a big button for your whip, and you just beat your horse to get them to run faster.

238
00:15:28,868 --> 00:15:29,829
[SPEAKER_17]: And you breed them.

239
00:15:30,289 --> 00:15:32,932
[SPEAKER_17]: And then if you do well in the races, people give you things.

240
00:15:33,112 --> 00:15:34,834
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a horse named Politary.

241
00:15:35,618 --> 00:15:37,181
[SPEAKER_17]: and she gets chicks and pussies.

242
00:15:37,581 --> 00:15:41,348
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, every time I win a race, a chick will come to the stable, or a cat.

243
00:15:41,528 --> 00:15:43,832
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, Politary gets the chicks and gets the pussy.

244
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:44,493
[SPEAKER_17]: What can you say?

245
00:15:47,924 --> 00:15:49,205
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, we're doing a show, hi.

246
00:15:49,286 --> 00:15:50,947
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello, what's up, what's going on?

247
00:15:51,047 --> 00:15:52,729
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, wait, Anita, Anita, Anita, come back.

248
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:53,790
[SPEAKER_17]: Anita, come say hi.

249
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,130
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi.

250
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,832
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, everybody, how are you?

251
00:15:55,912 --> 00:16:04,801
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't get women on this show very often, and poor Jamie's starting to... Well, I mean, Jamie, you were bitching about this the other day, that you're like, I'm the only woman on that whole show.

252
00:16:05,202 --> 00:16:05,863
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm all for you.

253
00:16:06,703 --> 00:16:10,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, it only takes like a few because women rule.

254
00:16:10,545 --> 00:16:11,926
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, is it going to be one of those nights?

255
00:16:11,946 --> 00:16:14,847
[SPEAKER_24]: Every one of us is at least worth a thousand of you.

256
00:16:15,187 --> 00:16:24,831
[SPEAKER_17]: Is this going to be one of those nights where it sounds like we're at some women's rights march and my vagina is a vortex from which all life explodes.

257
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,013
[SPEAKER_24]: Lastly got Orange Lounge.

258
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:34,942
[SPEAKER_24]: By the way, I did find a site for Derby Owners Club, so you can see what the machine looks like.

259
00:16:35,822 --> 00:16:42,266
[SPEAKER_24]: Go to expertdoc.flex.com And you'll post that in the chat room, won't you?

260
00:16:42,286 --> 00:16:43,607
[SPEAKER_17]: I just did already.

261
00:16:43,747 --> 00:16:44,768
[SPEAKER_24]: That is Derby Owners Club.

262
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,250
[SPEAKER_17]: It's very casino-like.

263
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,652
[SPEAKER_17]: It's purposely looking like that.

264
00:16:51,672 --> 00:16:53,613
[SPEAKER_24]: I made four new horses.

265
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:55,014
[SPEAKER_24]: One of them was called This is a Horse.

266
00:16:57,355 --> 00:16:59,577
[SPEAKER_24]: The other one was called Happy Bunny, which won a bunch of races.

267
00:17:01,071 --> 00:17:19,157
[SPEAKER_24]: and then Mel and Melody let me use two of their horses to breed a horse because I used one called Vanilla Ice that was all albino and then Saved by the Bell as in B-E-L-L-E That horse rules.

268
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:21,919
[SPEAKER_24]: The front part was black and the back was white.

269
00:17:22,739 --> 00:17:23,780
[SPEAKER_24]: And I bred a tiger horse.

270
00:17:25,001 --> 00:17:28,484
[SPEAKER_24]: Gold and white with tiger stripes and gold eyes and a tiger tail and everything.

271
00:17:28,584 --> 00:17:30,645
[SPEAKER_17]: It looks like a tiger, but it's a horse.

272
00:17:30,945 --> 00:17:31,766
[SPEAKER_17]: What's up with that?

273
00:17:33,047 --> 00:17:36,329
[SPEAKER_24]: And I thought it was going to be a boy because I've been breeding nothing but boys lately.

274
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,752
[SPEAKER_24]: And this one was a girl, so I couldn't get the name I originally wanted.

275
00:17:40,232 --> 00:17:42,754
[SPEAKER_17]: Last week on Orange Lounge, I've been breeding nothing but boys lately.

276
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:47,077
[SPEAKER_24]: So I named it Strong Badette.

277
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:49,209
[SPEAKER_17]: Very nice.

278
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:53,210
[SPEAKER_24]: And my other horse's name is for people who's missed it.

279
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,831
[SPEAKER_24]: My very first horse was Slytherin Chaser.

280
00:17:55,411 --> 00:17:56,491
[SPEAKER_17]: Because you're a Harry Potter whore.

281
00:17:57,711 --> 00:18:00,452
[SPEAKER_24]: And then I had, I like cheese.

282
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:04,953
[SPEAKER_24]: And then Hot Man Sex, S-E-C-H-S.

283
00:18:05,013 --> 00:18:06,574
[SPEAKER_17]: Because the machine will try to censor you.

284
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:13,831
[SPEAKER_24]: and then I had Fajitas and Jin Kazama because I'm a Tekken whore.

285
00:18:14,251 --> 00:18:14,691
[SPEAKER_17]: Very nice.

286
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:16,192
[SPEAKER_17]: I made two new horses yesterday.

287
00:18:16,613 --> 00:18:20,015
[SPEAKER_17]: I made a horse dedicated to one of my favorite Animal Crossing characters, Elmer.

288
00:18:20,675 --> 00:18:21,436
[SPEAKER_17]: So I made Elmer the horse.

289
00:18:21,456 --> 00:18:22,997
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I made a horse called Sir Mix-a-Lot.

290
00:18:23,517 --> 00:18:26,199
[SPEAKER_24]: My next horse I'm going to make is called Glue Factory.

291
00:18:27,781 --> 00:18:28,321
[SPEAKER_17]: Glue Factory?

292
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:29,041
[SPEAKER_17]: Glue Factory.

293
00:18:29,081 --> 00:18:29,482
[SPEAKER_17]: Very nice.

294
00:18:30,623 --> 00:18:31,483
[SPEAKER_24]: Rob is da funny.

295
00:18:33,024 --> 00:18:33,625
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just reading.

296
00:18:33,825 --> 00:18:35,146
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm trying to catch up on chat room, so...

297
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,864
[SPEAKER_24]: Horsey sex is bad, I want to make a law about that.

298
00:18:38,044 --> 00:18:39,445
[SPEAKER_24]: Horses have to have sex too!

299
00:18:39,465 --> 00:18:43,067
[SPEAKER_24]: Have you ever seen a horse that has got any... That's the thing about Derby Owners Club.

300
00:18:43,087 --> 00:18:46,510
[SPEAKER_17]: Derby Owners Club has this really explicit birthing scene to it.

301
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:50,133
[SPEAKER_17]: Like when you make a new horse for the first time... They go on a date.

302
00:18:50,573 --> 00:18:51,354
[SPEAKER_17]: They go on a date.

303
00:18:51,394 --> 00:18:53,495
[SPEAKER_17]: They send off the horses and they trot off.

304
00:18:54,476 --> 00:18:58,659
[SPEAKER_17]: And then they go to a tree and it fades out so you don't have to see horsey sex.

305
00:18:58,879 --> 00:19:04,003
[SPEAKER_17]: But then the next scene is them in a stable and then you see the male horse being all nurturing or whatever.

306
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:05,064
[SPEAKER_17]: The male horse isn't even there.

307
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:06,965
[SPEAKER_17]: The male horse is there, kind of looking.

308
00:19:06,985 --> 00:19:08,206
[SPEAKER_17]: The male horse is just kind of looking.

309
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:09,847
[SPEAKER_24]: No, the mare is laying down.

310
00:19:11,048 --> 00:19:15,470
[SPEAKER_17]: All I know is that you see the female horse, and all of a sudden it looks like she's going to take a giant crap.

311
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,131
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it doesn't.

312
00:19:16,151 --> 00:19:18,032
[SPEAKER_17]: And then all of a sudden there's a little baby.

313
00:19:18,272 --> 00:19:20,334
[SPEAKER_24]: No, that's not how it happens.

314
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,455
[SPEAKER_17]: I swear to God that's what I saw.

315
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:22,795
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

316
00:19:23,356 --> 00:19:24,476
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, thank you for that.

317
00:19:24,536 --> 00:19:27,438
[SPEAKER_24]: The mare is laying down, and the foal is laying beside her.

318
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:33,282
[SPEAKER_24]: And the foal gets up and goes, you know, it's like suddenly there's another horse, and then suddenly it's an adult.

319
00:19:34,452 --> 00:19:35,612
[SPEAKER_24]: Happy Bunny is still childish.

320
00:19:37,433 --> 00:19:39,113
[SPEAKER_18]: That horse sort of looks like Mr. Garrison.

321
00:19:42,453 --> 00:19:44,334
[SPEAKER_24]: I would not want to be Mr. Hat and have a hand on my ass.

322
00:19:44,354 --> 00:19:47,974
[SPEAKER_17]: The chat room is referencing a movie called Freddy Got Fingered, which I never bothered to watch.

323
00:19:49,015 --> 00:19:54,195
[SPEAKER_17]: Because, you're going to have to explain this to me, because I never found Tom Green funny.

324
00:19:54,215 --> 00:19:58,376
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if it's just me, but... He masturbates a horse in that.

325
00:19:58,936 --> 00:19:59,736
[SPEAKER_18]: So look what I can do!

326
00:19:59,896 --> 00:20:00,616
[SPEAKER_18]: Look what I can do!

327
00:20:00,737 --> 00:20:01,457
[SPEAKER_18]: Look what I can do!

328
00:20:02,597 --> 00:20:03,477
[SPEAKER_17]: Brilliant comedy.

329
00:20:04,076 --> 00:20:04,476
[SPEAKER_17]: Brilliant.

330
00:20:05,577 --> 00:20:14,022
[SPEAKER_24]: But anyway, that site that I just linked in the chatroom, there are screen captures of a... See, look, there's the mayor and there's the freaking pony.

331
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:18,145
[SPEAKER_17]: I swear to God, I had one where the chick was squatting and then out comes baby.

332
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,346
[SPEAKER_24]: That is not what happened.

333
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:20,987
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a hidden... I got an Easter egg.

334
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,368
[SPEAKER_17]: Boy, was it ever an egg.

335
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,331
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, chatroom, look at this.

336
00:20:27,371 --> 00:20:30,153
[SPEAKER_24]: Does that look like the mayor is giving birth?

337
00:20:30,974 --> 00:20:31,234
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

338
00:20:31,554 --> 00:20:32,375
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a vicious lie.

339
00:20:32,415 --> 00:20:33,255
[SPEAKER_17]: That's photoshopped.

340
00:20:34,036 --> 00:20:39,059
[SPEAKER_24]: Although one thing that's in here that makes me a little bit wondering is there's a picture of the horse walking on a path.

341
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:40,460
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the one.

342
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,061
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, there's the exercises you can do to the horse.

343
00:20:43,101 --> 00:20:44,302
[SPEAKER_17]: There's one where you can rest it.

344
00:20:44,382 --> 00:20:50,446
[SPEAKER_17]: The item all the way on the right is just like rest your horse and it goes on a trot through the forest and it's like your horse is relaxing.

345
00:20:51,486 --> 00:20:53,047
[SPEAKER_17]: To which it gets attacked by a bear and dies.

346
00:20:53,547 --> 00:20:54,048
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey!

347
00:20:54,808 --> 00:20:55,669
[SPEAKER_17]: Now that would be cool.

348
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,832
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it true that there's a Derby Owners Club 2 coming out?

349
00:20:59,412 --> 00:21:00,573
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, yeah, let me find the site again.

350
00:21:00,873 --> 00:21:01,614
[SPEAKER_24]: Someone hold the microphone.

351
00:21:01,954 --> 00:21:02,194
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

352
00:21:04,095 --> 00:21:04,295
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

353
00:21:04,636 --> 00:21:04,856
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi.

354
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:06,697
[SPEAKER_18]: Anybody else in here ever played Derby Owners Crack?

355
00:21:07,598 --> 00:21:08,218
[SPEAKER_18]: Nobody else has played?

356
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:10,320
[SPEAKER_18]: I have four horses.

357
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,721
[SPEAKER_18]: I've got... What are you guys doing?

358
00:21:13,162 --> 00:21:13,522
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, anyways.

359
00:21:13,802 --> 00:21:16,184
[SPEAKER_18]: I got, um... I have a horse called Mr. Spanky.

360
00:21:17,525 --> 00:21:20,687
[SPEAKER_18]: An ode to the stupid character from DDR PC.

361
00:21:21,588 --> 00:21:28,432
[SPEAKER_18]: We've got one called Big Black Cock, which was an inside joke on the show, so I have that.

362
00:21:28,492 --> 00:21:40,959
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I've got one called... I've got one called Cloud, and that was the one I stole from the little girl.

363
00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:41,740
[SPEAKER_18]: And then...

364
00:21:43,586 --> 00:21:44,047
[SPEAKER_18]: What was it?

365
00:21:45,348 --> 00:21:46,248
[SPEAKER_17]: Loki is not lying.

366
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:47,790
[SPEAKER_17]: He did steal that card from a little girl.

367
00:21:50,312 --> 00:21:51,372
[SPEAKER_18]: Shit, I have another one too.

368
00:21:51,673 --> 00:21:52,673
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't remember what it was called.

369
00:21:52,934 --> 00:21:55,095
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why all the kids run across the panels on you.

370
00:21:55,135 --> 00:21:56,697
[SPEAKER_18]: They attack you for stealing cards.

371
00:21:56,797 --> 00:21:58,358
[SPEAKER_18]: They're just stupid, those kids.

372
00:21:58,418 --> 00:21:59,218
[SPEAKER_18]: But I'll go into it later.

373
00:21:59,419 --> 00:21:59,779
[SPEAKER_18]: Trip them.

374
00:22:01,901 --> 00:22:02,141
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

375
00:22:03,001 --> 00:22:04,903
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to talk about what pissed me off yesterday, though.

376
00:22:05,463 --> 00:22:07,425
[SPEAKER_17]: This kind of goes into an FU of the week, but not really.

377
00:22:09,031 --> 00:22:10,611
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, because this is video game related.

378
00:22:10,671 --> 00:22:19,134
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, the Derby Owners Club, the way it works is you have one giant monitor, and there's eight little stations that you can sit at to play, so theoretically eight people can play the game at once.

379
00:22:19,694 --> 00:22:23,035
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you visited the website that was given out in the chatroom, you saw a picture, so you know what I'm talking about.

380
00:22:23,595 --> 00:22:28,696
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, well, at Milpitas Golf Land on a Saturday, it's pretty busy, so there's a lot of people that kind of want to play, and it's kind of full.

381
00:22:29,796 --> 00:22:31,537
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, you know, so I'm sitting there kind of waiting.

382
00:22:31,697 --> 00:22:32,578
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm waiting for a game.

383
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,900
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's freaking people just sitting there at the stations not doing anything.

384
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,361
[SPEAKER_17]: And they're just like, they just have all their crap there.

385
00:22:39,381 --> 00:22:43,863
[SPEAKER_17]: And like you can try and like wave at them, you know, go, hi, I want to play.

386
00:22:43,923 --> 00:22:45,244
[SPEAKER_17]: And they just totally ignore you.

387
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:46,124
[SPEAKER_17]: They're totally oblivious to you.

388
00:22:46,144 --> 00:22:48,025
[SPEAKER_24]: Some of the people there were actually waiting on particular races.

389
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,807
[SPEAKER_17]: And see, I think that, personally, I think that's bullshit.

390
00:22:51,187 --> 00:22:52,808
[SPEAKER_17]: Like if you're going to do that, if you're going to...

391
00:22:53,394 --> 00:22:57,895
[SPEAKER_17]: If you're going to do that where you're just going to sit on the game and wait for particular races, you need to do that on weeknight when no one's there.

392
00:22:58,315 --> 00:22:59,775
[SPEAKER_17]: You need not do that in the middle of a Saturday.

393
00:22:59,855 --> 00:23:03,116
[SPEAKER_17]: So, poo on you, you derby squatters.

394
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:07,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Guess that's happened to me with the initial D before.

395
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:17,119
[SPEAKER_24]: It's the difference between having two, where people are taking, where there's big lines of people, and then one with eight terminals, and people are just sitting there.

396
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:19,720
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a difference between initial D and Derby Owners Club.

397
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:20,480
[SPEAKER_17]: Mm-hmm.

398
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:24,262
[SPEAKER_17]: Initial D is not better.

399
00:23:24,822 --> 00:23:25,944
[SPEAKER_17]: Initial D is smelly.

400
00:23:26,064 --> 00:23:26,484
[SPEAKER_17]: Come on.

401
00:23:29,568 --> 00:23:30,970
[SPEAKER_17]: Johnny's fighting.

402
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:31,351
[SPEAKER_17]: Whatever.

403
00:23:33,774 --> 00:23:34,254
[SPEAKER_20]: Whatever.

404
00:23:40,976 --> 00:23:41,457
[SPEAKER_24]: Who?

405
00:23:41,657 --> 00:23:44,199
[SPEAKER_24]: You got admonished, Mr. Loki.

406
00:23:46,502 --> 00:23:49,084
[SPEAKER_24]: Ninja Usagi Koi says, bad, stealing from kids.

407
00:23:49,284 --> 00:23:50,385
[SPEAKER_24]: Who said that?

408
00:23:50,406 --> 00:23:50,806
[SPEAKER_24]: Ninja Usagi Koi.

409
00:23:50,886 --> 00:23:52,608
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I didn't technically steal it.

410
00:23:52,668 --> 00:23:54,930
[SPEAKER_18]: She was dumb and left it there, so I took it.

411
00:23:56,712 --> 00:23:59,014
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, taking advantage of other people's stupidity is okay.

412
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:02,778
[SPEAKER_24]: Should we actually try to have FUs of the week?

413
00:24:03,218 --> 00:24:03,619
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, let's...

414
00:24:05,472 --> 00:24:06,072
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for watching!

415
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:38,234
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, Poppin' Music 8 is coming out, and they've estimated that it's going to have over 100 songs on it, plus a new mode that's called Live Mode, which has something to do with these live videos of them playing.

416
00:24:38,274 --> 00:24:40,395
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what the fuck it is, because I don't play Poppin' Music.

417
00:24:40,595 --> 00:24:42,556
[SPEAKER_18]: I played it once, and I didn't like it, so there.

418
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:43,976
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, great.

419
00:24:44,017 --> 00:24:45,217
[SPEAKER_17]: Where's 2DX7Style?

420
00:24:46,658 --> 00:24:48,899
[SPEAKER_17]: Why do they keep cranking out the Poppin' Music?

421
00:24:48,939 --> 00:24:50,980
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello, 2DX7Style has already been announced.

422
00:24:51,903 --> 00:24:52,203
[SPEAKER_17]: When?

423
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:53,084
[SPEAKER_18]: When?

424
00:24:53,144 --> 00:24:54,265
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought it was coming out in April.

425
00:24:54,665 --> 00:24:55,406
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's just a rumor.

426
00:24:56,026 --> 00:24:56,487
[SPEAKER_18]: Whatever.

427
00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:01,370
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to research this a little bit.

428
00:25:02,351 --> 00:25:05,734
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I should really pay attention to all this news since I read it all the time.

429
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,054
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what?

430
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:07,655
[SPEAKER_17]: Poppin' Music, it's okay.

431
00:25:07,695 --> 00:25:08,416
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I like it.

432
00:25:08,516 --> 00:25:08,976
[SPEAKER_17]: It's cool.

433
00:25:08,996 --> 00:25:15,681
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think the reason a lot of people like it a lot, seriously, is because they don't have it many places.

434
00:25:15,721 --> 00:25:18,403
[SPEAKER_17]: So, like, having played it is like a special club.

435
00:25:18,603 --> 00:25:20,645
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, your leader, if you've played Poppin' Music or whatever...

436
00:25:21,579 --> 00:25:25,100
[SPEAKER_17]: Poppin' Music's cool and all, and it has some good tunes, but it makes my freaking hands hurt.

437
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,461
[SPEAKER_18]: What about Aerobics Revolution, huh, huh?

438
00:25:29,741 --> 00:25:33,923
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, and Max 2 for the Japanese home version, Max 2.

439
00:25:36,223 --> 00:25:40,344
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Matt the Ice Princess has a question, or I'm sorry, the Ice Queen.

440
00:25:40,604 --> 00:25:44,085
[SPEAKER_17]: Hold on, you have to speak into the mic so they can all hear you.

441
00:25:44,105 --> 00:25:49,507
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, so why don't you go ahead and enlighten all of us idiots out here who don't know what the hell you're talking about when you talk about Poppin' Music.

442
00:25:51,325 --> 00:25:51,965
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll let Loki do it.

443
00:25:53,506 --> 00:26:02,269
[SPEAKER_18]: Pop music is like 2DX, but you have big buttons that are round, you know, kind of like the bishy-boshy buttons, big round buttons, and you just, yeah, like trouble.

444
00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:05,430
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, it's like nine pop-o-matic bubbles that you have to hit in tune to music.

445
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,910
[SPEAKER_17]: That's an excellent way of describing it.

446
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:07,330
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Bombay.

447
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:14,333
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just, it's like, it's almost like if you were to take 2DX and turn it into like a Saturday morning cartoon, that's what it would be.

448
00:26:14,493 --> 00:26:17,694
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just like all nice and stuff, but it's still kind of difficult like 2DX.

449
00:26:19,199 --> 00:26:19,399
[SPEAKER_18]: Overplay

450
00:26:37,546 --> 00:26:39,447
[SPEAKER_18]: POPPING MUSIC

451
00:26:56,019 --> 00:27:04,245
[SPEAKER_18]: They've got some weird shit, weird modifiers on there and stuff, but it's pretty much like... But it's more like happy and rainbow-y and gay, because like the buttons are these big, right?

452
00:27:04,325 --> 00:27:05,586
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, yeah, I knew that would make you cheer.

453
00:27:05,866 --> 00:27:09,429
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it's got these big like red and yellow and blue and green buttons and they all flash.

454
00:27:09,849 --> 00:27:12,151
[SPEAKER_17]: And little things that fall, it's falling pancakes.

455
00:27:12,271 --> 00:27:12,932
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what they look like.

456
00:27:12,952 --> 00:27:15,033
[SPEAKER_17]: They're big falling pancakes that have big eyes on them.

457
00:27:15,053 --> 00:27:16,174
[SPEAKER_17]: They go, hi, meet me.

458
00:27:16,454 --> 00:27:19,917
[SPEAKER_17]: And they hit the button when they hit the blind and they go, ooh, excellent.

459
00:27:22,153 --> 00:27:49,909
[SPEAKER_17]: But like, sometimes you have to hit four buttons at once So you're playing the game like this with your elbows Well, that's good radio, no one can see that I know, okay You all did though Imagine doing the Tran Dance in the Stoic video That's kind of like what playing some poppin' music is Anyways And the only place I know of anywhere that has poppin' music I think they have a machine in Portland Yes, Bombay

460
00:27:50,552 --> 00:27:55,454
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I found one in Orange County, actually, at Camelot Golfland.

461
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:56,815
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, I'll be damned.

462
00:27:56,915 --> 00:27:57,635
[SPEAKER_17]: In Orange County.

463
00:27:58,335 --> 00:27:59,196
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the one near Disneyland.

464
00:27:59,376 --> 00:28:00,536
[SPEAKER_20]: Camelot, yeah, CMGO.

465
00:28:01,016 --> 00:28:01,537
[SPEAKER_20]: It's pretty tight.

466
00:28:01,837 --> 00:28:02,857
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't get a chance to play.

467
00:28:02,897 --> 00:28:04,318
[SPEAKER_20]: There's actually a lot of people playing, so.

468
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:05,938
[SPEAKER_17]: And then, of course, AI has one.

469
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,299
[SPEAKER_17]: They have Pop Music 9, which I did get to play when I was down there.

470
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:12,701
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, yeah, when we went down there, they had that shitty M, whatever that is, stupid MLO.

471
00:28:12,761 --> 00:28:13,902
[SPEAKER_17]: See, now that's one of Janie's favorites.

472
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:17,565
[SPEAKER_17]: That one sucked ass.

473
00:28:17,585 --> 00:28:20,387
[SPEAKER_17]: If you like anime, it's going to have all the songs you like in it.

474
00:28:21,088 --> 00:28:23,990
[SPEAKER_18]: Mambo Go Go was better than that.

475
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,291
[SPEAKER_17]: Leave me alone, I'm white.

476
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:33,198
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't pronounce shit tonight, leave me alone.

477
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,901
[SPEAKER_18]: But, uh, yeah.

478
00:28:37,622 --> 00:28:38,443
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, let's see here.

479
00:28:39,548 --> 00:28:43,311
[SPEAKER_18]: Other than that, it's just a lot of home versions coming out.

480
00:28:43,352 --> 00:28:46,274
[SPEAKER_18]: Pretty much everyone's waiting for Max 2 to come out.

481
00:28:46,314 --> 00:28:47,896
[SPEAKER_18]: We talked about that a little bit last week.

482
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:49,057
[SPEAKER_18]: And then there's Aerobics Revolution.

483
00:28:49,077 --> 00:28:50,678
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm so moist from excitement about Max 2.

484
00:28:50,718 --> 00:28:51,739
[SPEAKER_17]: That no one gives a shit about.

485
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,003
[SPEAKER_17]: Have they figured out if there's going to be anything special in it yet?

486
00:28:56,023 --> 00:28:57,824
[SPEAKER_17]: Have they announced any features or anything like that?

487
00:28:57,844 --> 00:28:59,626
[SPEAKER_17]: They announced how many songs there's supposed to be.

488
00:28:59,766 --> 00:29:00,006
[SPEAKER_17]: How many?

489
00:29:00,026 --> 00:29:00,267
[SPEAKER_17]: How many?

490
00:29:00,387 --> 00:29:00,727
[SPEAKER_17]: How many?

491
00:29:01,187 --> 00:29:02,008
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't remember!

492
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:03,670
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like 60 or 70.

493
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:04,931
[SPEAKER_18]: You're fired.

494
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:07,194
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't do anything.

495
00:29:08,215 --> 00:29:09,876
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, you're supposed to remember these things.

496
00:29:09,937 --> 00:29:19,125
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, when I'm like busy running a couple sites and doing shit for my work and... Listen, my job on this show is to be cute, and I fulfill that, so... What's your job?

497
00:29:19,165 --> 00:29:19,825
[SPEAKER_17]: Bring us news.

498
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:20,786
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you bringing us news?

499
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:22,528
[SPEAKER_17]: The fuck?

500
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:25,270
[SPEAKER_17]: That's messed up, man.

501
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,891
[SPEAKER_17]: You're bringing us like half the news.

502
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,493
[SPEAKER_17]: You're like MSNBC, Jesus.

503
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:31,876
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, oh, okay.

504
00:29:33,746 --> 00:29:35,007
[SPEAKER_18]: No, on Microsoft.

505
00:29:35,127 --> 00:29:35,547
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

506
00:29:36,548 --> 00:29:36,888
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see.

507
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:38,008
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm trying to think.

508
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:39,989
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't really know much about that.

509
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:42,211
[SPEAKER_18]: I have, like, gossip news.

510
00:29:42,451 --> 00:29:42,851
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, okay.

511
00:29:44,438 --> 00:29:51,600
[SPEAKER_18]: As reported on DDR Mania X in one of their random topic things, Monty Ruler, his backgrounds, he didn't make them.

512
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:52,940
[SPEAKER_18]: He stole them.

513
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,080
[SPEAKER_18]: Gossip!

514
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,001
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my god.

515
00:29:55,141 --> 00:29:55,781
[SPEAKER_17]: So who did?

516
00:29:56,221 --> 00:29:56,861
[SPEAKER_17]: Who cares?

517
00:29:57,181 --> 00:29:57,601
[SPEAKER_14]: Who did?

518
00:29:59,081 --> 00:29:59,442
[SPEAKER_17]: Who did?

519
00:29:59,622 --> 00:30:00,642
[SPEAKER_17]: He just got them off some sites.

520
00:30:00,702 --> 00:30:01,402
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't really matter.

521
00:30:01,582 --> 00:30:04,703
[SPEAKER_17]: So like he downloaded the artwork and just added the text or what?

522
00:30:04,763 --> 00:30:05,323
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, pretty much.

523
00:30:07,028 --> 00:30:07,849
[SPEAKER_17]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

524
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:35,663
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought for whatever reason you had a grudge against him or something and you would have liked that news.

525
00:30:35,723 --> 00:30:37,324
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't have a grudge against him.

526
00:30:38,204 --> 00:30:39,966
[SPEAKER_18]: I do not have a grudge against him.

527
00:30:41,067 --> 00:30:43,448
[SPEAKER_18]: The only thing I was saying was that his step-files are too hard.

528
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,670
[SPEAKER_18]: You cannot possibly play them on the feet.

529
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:48,312
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, try playing Stoic on a pad.

530
00:30:48,352 --> 00:30:50,814
[SPEAKER_18]: That's like... Hot Limit's not a ham.

531
00:30:52,115 --> 00:30:53,036
[SPEAKER_18]: You're Hot Limit, whatever.

532
00:30:54,316 --> 00:30:57,359
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I'm just talking... It's just... I don't know, his stuff's hard.

533
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:58,239
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't like it.

534
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,301
[SPEAKER_18]: Everyone calls it 4-key beat mania.

535
00:31:01,229 --> 00:31:02,150
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'd say it's pretty accurate.

536
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,271
[SPEAKER_18]: But, um, yeah.

537
00:31:04,311 --> 00:31:06,272
[SPEAKER_17]: So wait, how do you get news like that?

538
00:31:06,352 --> 00:31:10,475
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, so a site actually ran a news story saying, guess what?

539
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:12,476
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, it was a forum post, so.

540
00:31:12,576 --> 00:31:13,717
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, it was a forum post.

541
00:31:13,757 --> 00:31:15,838
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I thought it was like, I thought it was like front page.

542
00:31:16,078 --> 00:31:17,059
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm like, that's pretty sad.

543
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:22,002
[SPEAKER_17]: You know it's a slow news day when the front page news is, uh-uh, bitch didn't do his own art.

544
00:31:24,295 --> 00:31:25,616
[SPEAKER_18]: Who gives a shit anyways?

545
00:31:25,636 --> 00:31:31,420
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like art isn't really a big... Well, yeah, it makes your file look nice, but it has nothing to do with the steps at all.

546
00:31:32,101 --> 00:31:37,544
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think the only thing was is because... Maybe, okay, maybe because TourneyMix, they insisted that you make your own backgrounds, right?

547
00:31:37,624 --> 00:31:39,606
[SPEAKER_17]: And didn't he... Wasn't he a judge for that?

548
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:41,087
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

549
00:31:41,707 --> 00:31:43,889
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, he was a judge in the last one, but...

550
00:31:44,795 --> 00:31:46,135
[SPEAKER_18]: Whatever.

551
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:52,537
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I invite him for an interview on this show to clear the air, if he or any of his cohorts are listening.

552
00:31:52,557 --> 00:31:56,759
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't really know half the stories, because obviously I'm only reporting half the stories, since that's what you said.

553
00:31:57,399 --> 00:32:06,081
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't even know, I just think he might have been claiming that he did all the artwork, instead of just saying, hey, I got this from here, I have the text, done.

554
00:32:06,262 --> 00:32:09,522
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, if he just came forward and said that, everything would be fine.

555
00:32:10,023 --> 00:32:11,003
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all it is, but...

556
00:32:11,761 --> 00:32:14,583
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it was really fucking slow as far as nudes goes.

557
00:32:14,663 --> 00:32:15,403
[SPEAKER_18]: There's nothing.

558
00:32:15,443 --> 00:32:15,743
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what?

559
00:32:15,843 --> 00:32:16,684
[SPEAKER_17]: I want him on the show.

560
00:32:16,784 --> 00:32:17,724
[SPEAKER_17]: How can we make that happen?

561
00:32:17,965 --> 00:32:20,626
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to get him on the show and have him explain what happened.

562
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:23,768
[SPEAKER_18]: That's never going to happen, so isn't that your job?

563
00:32:24,048 --> 00:32:25,009
[SPEAKER_18]: Getting guests on the show?

564
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:25,769
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll see what I can do.

565
00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:27,950
[SPEAKER_18]: It's never going to fucking happen.

566
00:32:28,611 --> 00:32:29,491
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't matter.

567
00:32:29,511 --> 00:32:30,652
[SPEAKER_18]: Who cares?

568
00:32:34,794 --> 00:32:35,515
[SPEAKER_18]: So what's coming up?

569
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:38,817
[SPEAKER_18]: What's 4.15? 4.15?

570
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:45,081
[SPEAKER_24]: According to BuyRight, Beatmania 2DX7 style is coming out on April 15th of 2003.

571
00:32:46,241 --> 00:32:49,523
[SPEAKER_24]: But BuyRight is a shitty-ass place to order games from anyway.

572
00:32:50,503 --> 00:32:53,444
[SPEAKER_24]: Because they cheated me with my Tekken 4 and they suck and need to die.

573
00:32:53,945 --> 00:32:54,645
[SPEAKER_24]: Bitter, are we?

574
00:32:58,246 --> 00:33:00,167
[SPEAKER_17]: Bitter, party of one, your table's ready, bitter.

575
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:01,027
[SPEAKER_24]: Don't bite my ass.

576
00:33:01,788 --> 00:33:02,228
[SPEAKER_24]: But, um...

577
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:20,053
[SPEAKER_24]: But I mean, I don't know if anyone can find any... If anyone can look on Konami's Japanese site and find me proof that they have something up for Beatmania TDX7 style to be out and on home, or from any reliable place, send me a PM in the chatroom, please.

578
00:33:20,753 --> 00:33:22,294
[SPEAKER_24]: DarkSakura, SSF.

579
00:33:22,314 --> 00:33:23,715
[SPEAKER_17]: Speaking of chatroom, what's going on in there?

580
00:33:24,355 --> 00:33:25,616
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm talking about NCSX.

581
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:27,857
[SPEAKER_24]: I was just looking at NCSX and I didn't see any pre-order stuff.

582
00:33:28,437 --> 00:33:30,698
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to actually check NCSX right now.

583
00:33:33,699 --> 00:33:35,541
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so what else is going on?

584
00:33:36,763 --> 00:33:37,504
[SPEAKER_17]: MSNB Loki?

585
00:33:39,306 --> 00:33:39,646
[SPEAKER_18]: Damn right!

586
00:33:49,707 --> 00:34:11,319
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, you know, you'd be surprised, like, all the stuff that I do during the week, because basically my job, for those who don't know, I'm answering phones and talking to people, and I have my, you know, I have my Internet Explorer open all the time, you know, browsing webpages, because we're on T1, and I download about 500 megs worth of files every week, and, you know, so that's what I do all day.

587
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:16,922
[SPEAKER_18]: So I read about eight forums at the same time, all day long, and, um,

588
00:34:19,311 --> 00:34:25,878
[SPEAKER_18]: You'd think that I would know more what's going on, but really, to be honest, for the last three months, there has been nothing going on in the news.

589
00:34:26,078 --> 00:34:30,183
[SPEAKER_18]: Our shows have been just kind of like, okay, just find some new shit to talk about.

590
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:31,485
[SPEAKER_18]: Nothing there.

591
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:32,146
[SPEAKER_18]: So...

592
00:34:33,186 --> 00:34:44,495
[SPEAKER_18]: It really isn't that much going on right now, other than waiting for the home version of Max to come, which is probably going to have the same rehashed shit from DDR Max USA, which, you know, some of those songs.

593
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:50,860
[SPEAKER_18]: But at least we'll be able to make edits for it and stuff, and maybe a few new songs for Extreme 2 and whatnot.

594
00:34:51,061 --> 00:34:58,387
[SPEAKER_18]: And then, obviously, probably later on this year we'll have some news about DDR Extreme 2 and its development and all that stuff.

595
00:35:00,688 --> 00:35:02,170
[SPEAKER_18]: and then, you know, that kind of stuff.

596
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,271
[SPEAKER_18]: But right now, there's not too much.

597
00:35:04,591 --> 00:35:09,555
[SPEAKER_18]: New Guitar Freaks, obviously, is being, I think, playtested right now.

598
00:35:11,117 --> 00:35:15,620
[SPEAKER_18]: I want it to be available somewhere else besides, like, where you know it'll go to RPGL.

599
00:35:16,741 --> 00:35:21,385
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's talk about MoCap Golf, because we just got it at Sandia, and that game looks really fun.

600
00:35:23,202 --> 00:35:32,305
[SPEAKER_17]: Before we get on the mocap golf tangent, I just wanted to say, I'm looking at BimaniX.com, and they have 2DX 7th style coming out in August for the PS2.

601
00:35:32,325 --> 00:35:33,885
[SPEAKER_17]: So take that in your will.

602
00:35:33,925 --> 00:35:41,828
[SPEAKER_17]: However, they said that Beat Me is 7th mix, plus the finals coming out on PS2 in March, but I haven't heard anything about that yet, seeing as, hmm, it's March.

603
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:45,009
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, yeah, it's kind of surprising.

604
00:35:45,689 --> 00:35:47,730
[SPEAKER_18]: If my memory serves me right, I think it was the 24th or 25th.

605
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,330
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I thought I heard that was going to be late March.

606
00:35:51,131 --> 00:35:52,451
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, like last week.

607
00:35:53,766 --> 00:35:56,628
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, gee, Konami of Japan's doing a great job promoting it.

608
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,671
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, they do a great job with everything, like, you know.

609
00:36:02,232 --> 00:36:05,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, wasn't it supposed to come out, oh, I don't know, Christmas Eve last year?

610
00:36:05,675 --> 00:36:11,700
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, if I remember right, what they said about Christmas Eve was that that was just supposed to be 7th Mix for the PS1.

611
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,202
[SPEAKER_17]: And now they're doing 7th Mix plus the final PS2, whatever.

612
00:36:15,843 --> 00:36:16,723
[SPEAKER_17]: Eh, who cares?

613
00:36:16,743 --> 00:36:18,845
[SPEAKER_19]: Could you get on the boat, CapGolf, now?

614
00:36:20,007 --> 00:36:22,789
[SPEAKER_18]: And, like, an open letter to, like, frickin', um, Konami.

615
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,391
[SPEAKER_18]: Why are you ignoring Dead End?

616
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:28,452
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, that song back in third mix is a pretty cool song.

617
00:36:28,492 --> 00:36:29,513
[SPEAKER_18]: You haven't remixed it at all.

618
00:36:29,553 --> 00:36:35,016
[SPEAKER_18]: You've, like, remixed the hell out of Trip Machine and Paranoia and all those brilliant tunes and shit.

619
00:36:35,056 --> 00:36:36,718
[SPEAKER_24]: I wanna see Dead End in 2DX.

620
00:36:37,838 --> 00:36:38,178
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

621
00:36:39,419 --> 00:36:40,260
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be kinda cool.

622
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,301
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, MoCapGolf.

623
00:36:42,521 --> 00:36:43,782
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, MoCapGolf, yes.

624
00:36:45,423 --> 00:36:47,164
[SPEAKER_19]: Greatest motion capture game ever.

625
00:36:47,864 --> 00:36:48,565
[SPEAKER_21]: It is so cool.

626
00:36:50,938 --> 00:36:52,519
[SPEAKER_21]: It is damn cool, don't say that.

627
00:36:52,539 --> 00:36:53,959
[SPEAKER_21]: It freaking rules.

628
00:36:54,259 --> 00:36:58,840
[SPEAKER_21]: Dude, what other game can you hit a golf ball off the top of a building onto another one?

629
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,321
[SPEAKER_19]: Give him a microphone so I can bitch at him.

630
00:37:04,341 --> 00:37:12,363
[SPEAKER_20]: The only reason I'm mad is because over at Scandio, we're supposed to have Soul Calibur already, but instead I went into work today and saw a golf game.

631
00:37:13,044 --> 00:37:14,604
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, that made me kind of mad.

632
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:18,365
[SPEAKER_20]: I think a lot of other people... Soul Calibur 2's been out for a while now.

633
00:37:18,685 --> 00:37:20,226
[SPEAKER_20]: I know, but I'm waiting for it.

634
00:37:20,286 --> 00:37:26,212
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, Keith said he has this really, really awesome system for it, and I'm really excited about it.

635
00:37:26,373 --> 00:37:27,374
[SPEAKER_20]: But he just needs the software.

636
00:37:28,034 --> 00:37:28,595
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, yes.

637
00:37:28,715 --> 00:37:30,076
[SPEAKER_20]: Broaden your horizons.

638
00:37:30,156 --> 00:37:31,237
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all I need to say.

639
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:32,138
[SPEAKER_19]: Golf, man.

640
00:37:32,279 --> 00:37:32,599
[SPEAKER_19]: Golf.

641
00:37:34,781 --> 00:37:36,682
[SPEAKER_18]: I like Soul Calibur, but I don't know.

642
00:37:36,702 --> 00:37:38,642
[SPEAKER_18]: I tend to want to play other things now.

643
00:37:39,082 --> 00:37:41,823
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what game... It's not golf's better, it's just good.

644
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:44,364
[SPEAKER_24]: They need Tsuguri, the sword game.

645
00:37:46,024 --> 00:37:48,085
[SPEAKER_24]: It was called in America Blade of Honor or something.

646
00:37:48,905 --> 00:37:52,166
[SPEAKER_24]: And you can play it in like different sword styles and everything too.

647
00:37:52,526 --> 00:37:53,167
[SPEAKER_24]: That would be cool.

648
00:37:53,367 --> 00:37:54,787
[SPEAKER_24]: And like you can cut people in half.

649
00:37:55,547 --> 00:37:57,168
[SPEAKER_24]: And I played it in Vegas.

650
00:37:57,228 --> 00:37:57,688
[SPEAKER_24]: Vegas?

651
00:37:58,408 --> 00:38:01,369
[SPEAKER_24]: Because they actually had the Tsuguri one.

652
00:38:01,569 --> 00:38:02,389
[SPEAKER_24]: It was at New York.

653
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:03,510
[SPEAKER_18]: I am going there.

654
00:38:04,391 --> 00:38:10,642
[SPEAKER_24]: I paid four bucks actually to play that game and have a replay.

655
00:38:12,686 --> 00:38:13,628
[SPEAKER_24]: It's Vegas.

656
00:38:13,648 --> 00:38:14,650
[SPEAKER_24]: No one can hear what you're saying, by the way.

657
00:38:18,772 --> 00:38:20,973
[SPEAKER_20]: I played it in Orange County and it was only eight nickels.

658
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:24,694
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, there, but I was in Vegas and everything costs more in Vegas.

659
00:38:25,254 --> 00:38:27,135
[SPEAKER_24]: That was the only place I had ever seen it.

660
00:38:27,915 --> 00:38:34,537
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, but that game kicks mocap, you know, takes mocap golf, bends it over and says, hey, here's a sword, guess where it is?

661
00:38:37,138 --> 00:38:39,138
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, but usually golf clubs are longer than swords.

662
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:41,639
[SPEAKER_24]: Swords hurt more.

663
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:42,779
[SPEAKER_19]: They're sharper.

664
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,340
[SPEAKER_19]: Have you ever been hit with a golf ball before?

665
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,761
[SPEAKER_24]: Have you ever been anally raped by a sword?

666
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:50,121
[SPEAKER_19]: Have you?

667
00:38:52,922 --> 00:38:53,522
[SPEAKER_24]: I read a lot.

668
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:55,082
[SPEAKER_21]: That's all you could come up with?

669
00:38:55,202 --> 00:38:55,602
[SPEAKER_21]: Have you?

670
00:38:56,823 --> 00:38:58,263
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, that's all I could come up with right now.

671
00:38:58,283 --> 00:38:59,904
[SPEAKER_21]: This is like another Dave over here.

672
00:39:00,144 --> 00:39:01,404
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm like open all night.

673
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:03,965
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, he's like CCL Dave.

674
00:39:04,185 --> 00:39:05,005
[SPEAKER_18]: Lightning Dave.

675
00:39:05,165 --> 00:39:06,985
[SPEAKER_18]: I will just be on the attack all night.

676
00:39:07,585 --> 00:39:08,126
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just kidding.

677
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:09,986
[SPEAKER_18]: Because you play mocap golf.

678
00:39:10,426 --> 00:39:12,067
[SPEAKER_18]: And you can play on the beach.

679
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:17,168
[SPEAKER_24]: And for the record, by the way, I have been hit with a golf ball in the neck.

680
00:39:17,548 --> 00:39:17,968
[SPEAKER_24]: So, yeah.

681
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:24,927
[SPEAKER_19]: We're at, oh, I mean, no, not, no, where is it, where is it, someone actually hit it?

682
00:39:27,048 --> 00:39:28,249
[SPEAKER_24]: Someone hit a golf ball.

683
00:39:28,269 --> 00:39:29,730
[SPEAKER_19]: No, she threw it at herself.

684
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:30,610
[SPEAKER_24]: Into my neck.

685
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:33,691
[SPEAKER_24]: At themselves?

686
00:39:33,932 --> 00:39:34,432
[SPEAKER_18]: In the throat.

687
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:35,552
[SPEAKER_18]: You're kind of an idiot, aren't you?

688
00:39:38,054 --> 00:39:40,635
[SPEAKER_23]: They're gonna throw the ball at my throat!

689
00:39:41,215 --> 00:39:41,635
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh!

690
00:39:41,795 --> 00:39:42,496
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, man!

691
00:39:43,296 --> 00:39:44,857
[SPEAKER_23]: It sounds so like you, Loki.

692
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:47,198
[SPEAKER_24]: Rob's drinking nuclear waste.

693
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:58,205
[SPEAKER_17]: This green drink that I'm drinking is Hawaiian Punch Green Blast, or what's it called?

694
00:39:58,225 --> 00:39:59,886
[SPEAKER_17]: Hawaiian Punch Green Shit Flavor.

695
00:40:00,586 --> 00:40:04,147
[SPEAKER_24]: I think they only had it in SoCal, and now they have it at the Ralph's by my house.

696
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:06,868
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, it's very nice.

697
00:40:07,468 --> 00:40:09,728
[SPEAKER_24]: I blame Melody for getting me hooked to that.

698
00:40:10,148 --> 00:40:12,429
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to share my accomplishment with everyone on the radio here.

699
00:40:12,909 --> 00:40:15,170
[SPEAKER_17]: I am nine days without soda.

700
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:16,830
[SPEAKER_17]: I haven't had a soda in nine days.

701
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:19,231
[SPEAKER_24]: We're starting a 12-step program, Soda Drinkers Anonymous.

702
00:40:22,342 --> 00:40:48,387
[SPEAKER_17]: I should crack open a Pepsi, fuck off So yeah, now this is a big deal for me Because I usually have a Mountain Dew in the morning just to wake up And then like, you know, I drink like three vanilla Cokes when I get home So it's a pretty big deal, so Of course, Hawaiian Punch really isn't that much better for you than soda But eh, you know, it's a special day You know what, it's a special day, so eat shit

703
00:40:51,513 --> 00:40:55,256
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so should we take a break for a minute?

704
00:40:56,176 --> 00:40:56,997
[SPEAKER_17]: Should we take a break for a minute?

705
00:40:57,698 --> 00:40:58,818
[SPEAKER_17]: You want to do the FUs when we come back?

706
00:41:02,621 --> 00:41:06,104
[SPEAKER_17]: Prepare yourself for the FUs that are coming up when we get back.

707
00:41:06,584 --> 00:41:11,508
[SPEAKER_17]: If you would like to submit an FU, remember, tonight we're at Jamie's, so don't send them to me.

708
00:41:11,808 --> 00:41:14,470
[SPEAKER_17]: You'll see my name in the chatroom says I'm out, out and about.

709
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,320
[SPEAKER_17]: So you want to send them to Jamie.

710
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,601
[SPEAKER_17]: Her nickname is DarkSakuraSSF.

711
00:41:18,761 --> 00:41:20,362
[SPEAKER_17]: So send your FUs of the week to Jamie.

712
00:41:20,802 --> 00:41:23,022
[SPEAKER_17]: And we'll try to keep it short this week, we promise.

713
00:41:23,082 --> 00:41:25,303
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody in the room is going to keep them short tonight, yes?

714
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,104
[SPEAKER_17]: FUs will be short tonight, yes?

715
00:41:29,124 --> 00:41:29,404
[SPEAKER_17]: No?

716
00:41:30,645 --> 00:41:32,365
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, so short FUs tonight.

717
00:41:32,465 --> 00:41:34,906
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so we'll be back in a little bit.

718
00:41:35,206 --> 00:41:37,567
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, we'll stretch a little more.

719
00:41:38,576 --> 00:41:39,537
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me plug the website.

720
00:41:39,557 --> 00:41:40,458
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me plug the chat room.

721
00:41:40,478 --> 00:41:44,561
[SPEAKER_17]: If you want to be able to submit those FUs, you've got to get to our chat room, and the chat room's at our website.

722
00:41:44,861 --> 00:41:48,944
[SPEAKER_17]: Just orange line, skie.cx, and then click on chat.

723
00:41:49,304 --> 00:41:50,866
[SPEAKER_17]: That URL's a little hard to remember.

724
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:52,427
[SPEAKER_17]: I've got a much easier one for you to remember.

725
00:41:52,707 --> 00:42:01,574
[SPEAKER_17]: Just go to calibamani.com, C-A-L-I-B-A-M-A-N-I dot com, and we're an affiliate of calibamani.com, so they've got a link right there on the front page to the radio station.

726
00:42:03,712 --> 00:42:09,017
[SPEAKER_18]: You should do a TK, like register a TK, you know, one of those.

727
00:42:10,078 --> 00:42:10,218
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

728
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:12,860
[SPEAKER_18]: Fine!

729
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,081
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, but they cost money.

730
00:42:16,281 --> 00:42:22,723
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, yeah, when I get a little more money, I'm going to purchase a .org on behalf of the stations, or .com or .org, so we'll be at Orange Lounge Radio or Orange Lounge.

731
00:42:22,763 --> 00:42:23,304
[SPEAKER_18]: How about .tv?

732
00:42:23,484 --> 00:42:25,665
[SPEAKER_18]: Because all the good websites have .tv.

733
00:42:25,925 --> 00:42:29,547
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we could say, as seen on TV, even though, you know, we've never been on TV.

734
00:42:29,627 --> 00:42:34,469
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I was on TV for Understation Live, and Jamie's name was in the chat room.

735
00:42:34,489 --> 00:42:41,612
[SPEAKER_18]: My friend Sean wants us to take our recordings of the show and actually broadcast them on public access radio.

736
00:42:43,175 --> 00:42:45,096
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you say shit and fuck on public access radio?

737
00:42:45,136 --> 00:42:45,697
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think so.

738
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:52,962
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure you can, they just might censor, I don't know, whatever.

739
00:42:53,022 --> 00:42:56,504
[SPEAKER_19]: If they censored this show, there'd be like three episodes worth of time.

740
00:42:57,845 --> 00:42:59,446
[SPEAKER_24]: Shit, fuck, damn, cock, pussy.

741
00:43:00,967 --> 00:43:01,367
[SPEAKER_24]: Cut!

742
00:43:03,589 --> 00:43:04,289
[SPEAKER_17]: That's my favorite.

743
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:07,592
[SPEAKER_17]: Little known fact, I actually was a public access celebrity.

744
00:43:11,275 --> 00:43:12,177
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, we're going to break.

745
00:43:12,197 --> 00:43:12,918
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, we're going to break.

746
00:43:12,938 --> 00:43:13,178
[SPEAKER_24]: Bye.

747
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,883
[SPEAKER_24]: We're playing our fuck you songs, so stay tuned.

748
00:43:49,481 --> 00:43:50,161
Rock'n'roll!

749
00:43:50,181 --> 00:43:50,561
Junkie!

750
00:43:50,581 --> 00:43:50,882
JoJo!

751
00:44:18,379 --> 00:44:23,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Miyato, Konoha, Tosuke, Jojo

752
00:46:43,228 --> 00:46:43,589
Yeah, Dr. Bob!

753
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:28,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Solid Snake Can you hear what I'm saying?

754
00:49:28,574 --> 00:49:36,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this damn sicko man's in a wheelchair bag I'm gonna kick your ass, beat him, kill him, oh Don't, what am I gonna do?

755
00:49:36,501 --> 00:49:38,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't, don't, what am I gonna do?

756
00:49:39,283 --> 00:49:40,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't, what am I gonna do?

757
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:46,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't, don't Have you ever seen a cool game like this?

758
00:49:52,898 --> 00:49:59,483
[SPEAKER_30]: Niko Meow, Niko Meow, Niko Meow, Meow, Meow, Meow Oh, ass!

759
00:50:00,003 --> 00:50:02,705
[SPEAKER_30]: This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

760
00:50:06,608 --> 00:50:07,929
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm eating a taquito.

761
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,811
[SPEAKER_24]: We are eating taquitos.

762
00:50:10,951 --> 00:50:12,171
[SPEAKER_24]: Taquito!

763
00:50:12,191 --> 00:50:13,813
[SPEAKER_24]: I love taquitos.

764
00:50:13,853 --> 00:50:15,234
[SPEAKER_15]: The official food of Orange Lounge?

765
00:50:15,254 --> 00:50:15,594
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

766
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:19,176
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Ice Queen, for getting the taquitos.

767
00:50:19,196 --> 00:50:19,897
[SPEAKER_17]: They're delicious.

768
00:50:21,232 --> 00:50:22,132
[SPEAKER_18]: I hate them good.

769
00:50:22,532 --> 00:50:22,793
[SPEAKER_18]: Why?

770
00:50:23,513 --> 00:50:24,593
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I don't like Mexican food.

771
00:50:25,193 --> 00:50:26,014
[SPEAKER_17]: Because it makes you poop?

772
00:50:26,694 --> 00:50:27,994
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I just don't like Mexican food.

773
00:50:31,736 --> 00:50:33,136
[SPEAKER_18]: Their food sucks ass!

774
00:50:33,216 --> 00:50:36,377
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what I have against them.

775
00:50:37,077 --> 00:50:38,138
[SPEAKER_17]: Loki, you forgot the water, too.

776
00:50:39,542 --> 00:50:47,265
[SPEAKER_18]: But I'm pleasantly surprised that, what was it, Chevys, they have hot wings and they were damn good.

777
00:50:47,665 --> 00:50:49,406
[SPEAKER_18]: That was the only thing I ate last night at Chevys.

778
00:50:49,426 --> 00:50:51,986
[SPEAKER_24]: Chevys has damn good fajitas because they have that cornmeal stuff.

779
00:50:53,147 --> 00:50:56,468
[SPEAKER_24]: And me, I'm allergic to corn, but I will eat that cornmeal stuff like all day.

780
00:50:56,508 --> 00:50:59,149
[SPEAKER_24]: I had them give me an extra thing of it and I did nothing but eat that cornmeal one day.

781
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:06,074
[SPEAKER_17]: Amanda, one of the official lesbians of Orange Launch Radio who was here a couple weeks ago, we were at Chevy's the other day and she kept threatening to tell them it was my birthday.

782
00:51:06,414 --> 00:51:08,835
[SPEAKER_17]: And that got me to thinking, you know, how would the restaurants know?

783
00:51:08,975 --> 00:51:12,758
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, you know, if you go in there every time you eat and tell them it's your birthday, they'd never know, huh?

784
00:51:12,978 --> 00:51:14,299
[SPEAKER_17]: And you can get, like, free ice cream.

785
00:51:14,619 --> 00:51:19,041
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, okay, as long as you didn't go to the same Chevy's every week, okay, then they'd probably catch on.

786
00:51:19,281 --> 00:51:23,604
[SPEAKER_19]: But, you know, if you go a different... Then again, they'd probably, like, keep track of it.

787
00:51:23,624 --> 00:51:25,085
[SPEAKER_19]: They'd, like, take pictures of you, like...

788
00:51:25,405 --> 00:51:26,346
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't take pictures.

789
00:51:26,366 --> 00:51:28,727
[SPEAKER_17]: Have you ever seen them snap a camera as they're singing happy birthday?

790
00:51:28,787 --> 00:51:31,148
[SPEAKER_17]: No, they put the sombrero on your head, sing their verse, they leave.

791
00:51:32,709 --> 00:51:35,130
[SPEAKER_17]: If you don't tip them, then they'll know who you are.

792
00:51:37,391 --> 00:51:38,412
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a thing we should do.

793
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:42,754
[SPEAKER_21]: Just, like, send you out to as many places and see how many places you get a birthday at a day.

794
00:51:43,174 --> 00:51:45,756
[SPEAKER_21]: For, like, a week and just see what you can do.

795
00:51:45,776 --> 00:51:46,896
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, okay, we can do it.

796
00:51:47,256 --> 00:51:48,517
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, well, you can pull that off.

797
00:51:50,245 --> 00:51:50,965
[SPEAKER_17]: You're the intern, though.

798
00:51:50,985 --> 00:51:52,006
[SPEAKER_17]: You have to do the embarrassing stuff.

799
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:52,726
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll tell them it's your birthday.

800
00:51:52,747 --> 00:51:53,727
[SPEAKER_18]: I have to do the embarrassing stuff?

801
00:51:53,947 --> 00:51:54,648
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, thank you.

802
00:51:55,208 --> 00:51:56,148
[SPEAKER_18]: See, I love my birthday.

803
00:51:56,168 --> 00:51:57,229
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we'll give me the ice cream.

804
00:51:57,709 --> 00:52:02,312
[SPEAKER_18]: My birthday kicks ass because I get to be cheerful and everyone's, like, so sad.

805
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:03,193
[SPEAKER_18]: I love it.

806
00:52:03,413 --> 00:52:07,875
[SPEAKER_18]: That was the best gift anyone could give me was the death of thousands and thousands of people on my birthday.

807
00:52:14,219 --> 00:52:14,839
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see.

808
00:52:14,979 --> 00:52:18,681
[SPEAKER_17]: Unpolitically correct statement took less than an hour this time into the show.

809
00:52:18,742 --> 00:52:19,442
[SPEAKER_17]: Congratulations.

810
00:52:21,141 --> 00:52:23,082
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we should get to the fuck you's of the week, right?

811
00:52:23,462 --> 00:52:24,563
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, good idea.

812
00:52:24,603 --> 00:52:24,903
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure.

813
00:52:25,524 --> 00:52:25,844
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

814
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:31,527
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, but we don't have, we can't play music in the background because my mixer sucks and I need a new sound card.

815
00:52:31,928 --> 00:52:33,168
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyone wants to get me a new sound card?

816
00:52:33,629 --> 00:52:33,949
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

817
00:52:34,549 --> 00:52:34,809
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyway.

818
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:37,451
[SPEAKER_24]: First fuck you of the week goes to my sound card.

819
00:52:41,293 --> 00:52:42,374
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry, Cacuaint.

820
00:52:42,774 --> 00:52:43,034
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

821
00:52:43,394 --> 00:52:44,734
[SPEAKER_18]: This is fucked up.

822
00:52:47,676 --> 00:52:51,837
[SPEAKER_24]: Um... Also, it goes toward having no money right now because I'm paying for my car.

823
00:52:52,777 --> 00:53:02,621
[SPEAKER_24]: Um... Also... It goes toward, um... Not being able to go buy myself, like, more socks because I have this unnatural sock collection.

824
00:53:02,641 --> 00:53:03,501
[SPEAKER_24]: Look at my socks.

825
00:53:03,521 --> 00:53:03,942
[SPEAKER_24]: They're cool.

826
00:53:05,742 --> 00:53:07,663
[SPEAKER_24]: My socks look like a big pink and black barcode.

827
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:08,883
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyway.

828
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:10,184
[SPEAKER_24]: Um...

829
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:12,550
[SPEAKER_21]: I said you are $2.37.

830
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:13,230
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

831
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:17,852
[SPEAKER_24]: I actually only have $11 I make right now.

832
00:53:18,813 --> 00:53:20,673
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, fuck you to bandwidth.

833
00:53:22,054 --> 00:53:24,875
[SPEAKER_24]: And I really am not angsty about much of anything else.

834
00:53:25,876 --> 00:53:26,096
[SPEAKER_24]: Cool.

835
00:53:26,476 --> 00:53:27,376
[SPEAKER_24]: Fuck you to work tomorrow.

836
00:53:27,396 --> 00:53:27,956
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't want to go.

837
00:53:28,957 --> 00:53:29,257
[SPEAKER_24]: Next.

838
00:53:34,702 --> 00:53:52,817
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see, my FUs of the week are FU to those people that squat on Derby Owners Club, that sucks FU to gas prices, oh my god Even the cheap shit's two bucks a gallon, F that What else do I want to say FU to?

839
00:53:55,139 --> 00:54:01,625
[SPEAKER_17]: And, I don't know, FU to the fact that I haven't gotten laid in six months, that sucks

840
00:54:03,829 --> 00:54:04,950
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, Loki's turn.

841
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:07,072
[SPEAKER_17]: Cause we're all keeping him quick tonight, yeah, yeah?

842
00:54:09,394 --> 00:54:13,577
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, let's see, well, F you to the stupid little kids, just everywhere.

843
00:54:14,443 --> 00:54:15,243
[SPEAKER_18]: Kill them while they're young.

844
00:54:15,984 --> 00:54:35,073
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, if it was a stupid slow-ass van that was in front of me on my way here, um, I understand that you like going 25 miles an hour in a 35, and the fact that all the people in your van are disabled, probably blind or deaf or something, um, you know, seriously, if I had any sort of, you know, rocker-propelled explosive, that van would be gone.

845
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:42,496
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, I almost, I was almost tempted to push them into traffic, because I figure, you know, who's gonna miss them?

846
00:54:42,556 --> 00:54:43,517
[SPEAKER_18]: No one's gonna miss them, so...

847
00:54:44,663 --> 00:54:45,204
[SPEAKER_18]: F you to that.

848
00:54:45,744 --> 00:54:55,232
[SPEAKER_18]: And F you to my site for being stupid because FTP went link right and that sucked because all the files are down for like all day.

849
00:54:56,053 --> 00:54:57,454
[SPEAKER_18]: But I fixed that and that was cool.

850
00:54:57,774 --> 00:55:04,160
[SPEAKER_18]: And F you to me for having so much work because I'm like busy all the time and I can't enjoy anything.

851
00:55:04,997 --> 00:55:06,658
[SPEAKER_18]: Just work, work, work, work, work.

852
00:55:09,321 --> 00:55:11,162
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, F you the gas prices because they suck.

853
00:55:12,103 --> 00:55:15,226
[SPEAKER_18]: I just know because all the gas station tenants are just jealous that we're bombing their country.

854
00:55:15,686 --> 00:55:17,948
[SPEAKER_18]: So, that's it.

855
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:18,649
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm done.

856
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:21,131
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my god.

857
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:24,811
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, I only got a few FUs.

858
00:55:25,252 --> 00:55:30,736
[SPEAKER_21]: One is to those people who get on the bus in the wheelchairs but manage to get up and walk when they get off the bus.

859
00:55:31,236 --> 00:55:37,421
[SPEAKER_21]: I always wondered, like, to some of these people who just look absolutely normal, if you push them out to traffic, I bet you anything they would get up and run.

860
00:55:39,403 --> 00:55:41,925
[SPEAKER_21]: They would leave the wheelchair at the middle of the road and get up and fucking run.

861
00:55:43,371 --> 00:55:45,832
[SPEAKER_21]: Another one is to my lack of concentration.

862
00:55:46,153 --> 00:55:57,077
[SPEAKER_21]: Today I almost full combo cancelled off Falling in Love on Light 7 on 2DX and I missed the last fucking note and so I almost killed the machine as I jumped up in circles.

863
00:55:59,251 --> 00:55:59,351
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

864
00:55:59,371 --> 00:55:59,972
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I have a mic.

865
00:56:21,533 --> 00:56:29,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck you to the assholes that were getting in my way while I was trying to pass Daikin Kai Light yesterday at Country Club Lanes.

866
00:56:30,364 --> 00:56:31,425
[SPEAKER_18]: You couldn't pass it anyway.

867
00:56:31,945 --> 00:56:34,228
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I know, but still.

868
00:56:35,189 --> 00:56:39,054
[SPEAKER_13]: They're getting in my way, getting on the machine and giving me shit.

869
00:56:41,366 --> 00:56:42,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

870
00:57:03,177 --> 00:57:06,099
[SPEAKER_18]: And one of these days on the show, I'm just going to be myself and be nice.

871
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:07,960
[SPEAKER_18]: Seriously.

872
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,861
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I'm, like, a really nice person.

873
00:57:10,262 --> 00:57:11,682
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I'm a really nice person.

874
00:57:11,763 --> 00:57:13,183
[SPEAKER_18]: I just have, like, weird strangers.

875
00:57:13,203 --> 00:57:13,484
[SPEAKER_18]: Really?

876
00:57:14,344 --> 00:57:14,744
[SPEAKER_18]: I am!

877
00:57:14,825 --> 00:57:15,605
[SPEAKER_18]: I am nice!

878
00:57:15,845 --> 00:57:19,367
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys have all made me out to be, like, this crazy racist guy.

879
00:57:20,388 --> 00:57:20,908
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not that person.

880
00:57:20,928 --> 00:57:22,229
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what you get for hanging out with Rob.

881
00:57:22,249 --> 00:57:22,830
[SPEAKER_18]: I love everybody.

882
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:23,550
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

883
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:25,251
[SPEAKER_18]: Except that... Forget the porn addicts.

884
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:27,613
[SPEAKER_18]: I love everybody except the disabled and stupid people.

885
00:57:28,133 --> 00:57:28,473
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey.

886
00:57:31,055 --> 00:57:32,496
[SPEAKER_18]: That would fall under stupid people.

887
00:57:33,343 --> 00:57:35,804
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, disabled people are cool if they're smart.

888
00:57:35,964 --> 00:57:37,065
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just the stupid people I hate.

889
00:57:37,105 --> 00:57:38,865
[SPEAKER_18]: I hate stupid people all about.

890
00:57:38,886 --> 00:57:39,506
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay?

891
00:57:41,627 --> 00:57:42,567
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I hate humanity.

892
00:57:43,407 --> 00:57:45,128
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, well, I guess, you know, I can't win.

893
00:57:47,409 --> 00:57:49,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck the shit I've been having and fuck being single.

894
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:50,531
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

895
00:57:55,873 --> 00:58:01,756
[SPEAKER_20]: If you had Scandia still for nobody ever giving me my watch back still, it's been a week and I still don't have my watch back.

896
00:58:02,316 --> 00:58:02,676
[SPEAKER_20]: That's all.

897
00:58:05,663 --> 00:58:06,624
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck you to cunt.

898
00:58:07,425 --> 00:58:08,786
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck you to stupid people.

899
00:58:08,887 --> 00:58:11,049
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck you to pussy everywhere.

900
00:58:13,171 --> 00:58:14,132
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's about it right now.

901
00:58:14,453 --> 00:58:20,039
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and fuck you to big ass on the fucking sliding glass window.

902
00:58:29,895 --> 00:58:30,695
[SPEAKER_15]: Check, one, two.

903
00:58:30,935 --> 00:58:31,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Are we still up?

904
00:58:31,855 --> 00:58:32,396
[SPEAKER_15]: Check our level.

905
00:58:32,436 --> 00:58:33,056
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we're going.

906
00:58:33,596 --> 00:58:33,896
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

907
00:58:34,736 --> 00:58:36,757
[SPEAKER_15]: Give your F you one more time, Matt, because they're so great.

908
00:58:36,777 --> 00:58:40,158
[SPEAKER_22]: I said, fuck you to pussy and fuck you to cunt and just pussy everywhere.

909
00:58:40,238 --> 00:58:40,958
[SPEAKER_22]: Just fuck you.

910
00:58:43,818 --> 00:58:46,439
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, yeah, I am stupid, people, but that kind of falls in the same category.

911
00:58:47,439 --> 00:58:48,100
[SPEAKER_32]: You've spickled.

912
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,680
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, okay.

913
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:50,440
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, you're too nice.

914
00:58:52,521 --> 00:58:53,401
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't like nice.

915
00:58:53,501 --> 00:58:53,961
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I'm just kidding.

916
00:58:54,665 --> 00:58:58,386
[SPEAKER_18]: and fuck you, the Oprah, because who are you trying to fool reading British lit?

917
00:58:58,506 --> 00:59:00,307
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, like you're reading British lit.

918
00:59:14,211 --> 00:59:16,292
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm talking loudly.

919
00:59:16,692 --> 00:59:20,093
[SPEAKER_02]: I think somebody's shooting a machine gun out front.

920
00:59:20,353 --> 00:59:22,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we have firecrackers outside or something.

921
00:59:23,425 --> 00:59:24,145
[SPEAKER_17]: Jamie's going to run away.

922
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:25,546
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to see if I hear a yell.

923
00:59:25,826 --> 00:59:26,847
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to see if she yells something.

924
00:59:28,408 --> 00:59:29,288
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, hold on, hold on.

925
00:59:29,308 --> 00:59:30,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody was knocking on the door.

926
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:32,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, bye-bye.

927
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:32,910
[SPEAKER_32]: They're leaving?

928
00:59:33,311 --> 00:59:35,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunja and Johnny are leaving?

929
00:59:35,352 --> 00:59:36,712
[SPEAKER_02]: No, okay, Johnny's not leaving.

930
00:59:40,492 --> 00:59:42,333
[SPEAKER_21]: I gotta say, fuck book clubs.

931
00:59:42,373 --> 00:59:43,713
[SPEAKER_21]: You can say fuck book clubs.

932
00:59:43,793 --> 00:59:45,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in a book club.

933
00:59:45,634 --> 00:59:46,415
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck book clubs.

934
00:59:46,455 --> 00:59:47,135
[SPEAKER_21]: They're stupid.

935
00:59:48,736 --> 00:59:51,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Not Oprah's book club, but it's like Oprah's book club.

936
00:59:51,937 --> 00:59:59,000
[SPEAKER_24]: We need to take a moment so we can let some very special people say hi.

937
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,601
[SPEAKER_24]: She eats books and craps cash.

938
01:00:02,522 --> 01:00:05,463
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi, this is Rick.

939
01:00:06,183 --> 01:00:06,384
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi.

940
01:00:06,764 --> 01:00:09,045
[SPEAKER_32]: And fuck you to Rick for never being around anymore.

941
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:12,740
[SPEAKER_32]: My life's been good.

942
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:13,621
[SPEAKER_32]: My week's been good.

943
01:00:14,421 --> 01:00:19,544
[SPEAKER_17]: So your life's good, so you can't say hi to us anymore?

944
01:00:19,564 --> 01:00:25,027
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know, I've been poking around Scandia lately after work, but I get off work at 1.30, so... Oh, poopy.

945
01:00:25,227 --> 01:00:26,948
[SPEAKER_17]: So nobody gets to see me over there by myself.

946
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:28,728
[SPEAKER_17]: You're just a mystery now.

947
01:00:29,329 --> 01:00:29,629
[SPEAKER_17]: I am?

948
01:00:30,369 --> 01:00:32,550
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I mean, you know, because we don't see you.

949
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:34,772
[SPEAKER_32]: You know what, I've really gone down in skill, too.

950
01:00:34,812 --> 01:00:39,394
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, I was doing just a standard little one, and then all of a sudden my legs stopped working.

951
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:41,231
[SPEAKER_17]: Me too, and I've gotten fat, see?

952
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:41,931
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh-huh.

953
01:00:43,632 --> 01:00:44,632
[SPEAKER_17]: You're expecting to.

954
01:00:44,692 --> 01:00:45,372
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I know.

955
01:00:45,972 --> 01:00:49,114
[SPEAKER_17]: So what do you want to say to all the listeners, the worldwide listeners of Orange Lounge Radio?

956
01:00:50,534 --> 01:00:52,495
[SPEAKER_32]: Play lots of DDR and try to lose your belly.

957
01:00:53,495 --> 01:00:55,496
[SPEAKER_32]: For God's sake, you're embarrassing yourself.

958
01:00:55,996 --> 01:00:56,336
[SPEAKER_32]: That's all.

959
01:00:58,897 --> 01:01:00,938
[SPEAKER_18]: We want to talk about embarrassing yourselves.

960
01:01:00,978 --> 01:01:02,079
[SPEAKER_18]: We saw this guy today.

961
01:01:02,139 --> 01:01:02,879
[SPEAKER_18]: Holy crap.

962
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:05,280
[SPEAKER_18]: Did he suck ass at freestyle?

963
01:01:06,656 --> 01:01:08,617
[SPEAKER_18]: Man, he was just, like, getting up on their doubles.

964
01:01:08,657 --> 01:01:12,620
[SPEAKER_18]: He had no sense of, you know, coordination, balance, rhythm, or anything.

965
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,682
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't even know why he was... I don't even know how he was able to do doubles to begin with.

966
01:01:15,702 --> 01:01:16,663
[SPEAKER_24]: Robin, I don't know anything about that.

967
01:01:17,163 --> 01:01:35,495
[SPEAKER_18]: He was just up there, like, doing his thing, like, holding the bar, and he tried jumping... Okay, first he started off his first song playing light, little, with no free zeros, and he jumped up over the bar, totally off cue, and totally missed the first step, nearly, like, broke his ankle.

968
01:01:35,655 --> 01:01:36,356
[SPEAKER_18]: It was hilarious.

969
01:01:37,538 --> 01:01:38,400
[SPEAKER_18]: Bye!

970
01:01:38,741 --> 01:01:39,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye!

971
01:01:41,306 --> 01:01:42,569
[SPEAKER_17]: Did you ever get to do your FUs, Nita?

972
01:01:43,651 --> 01:01:44,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really have an FU.

973
01:01:45,973 --> 01:01:47,835
[SPEAKER_17]: Why are all the women nice today except Jamie?

974
01:01:47,855 --> 01:01:48,655
[SPEAKER_17]: Jamie's always mean, though.

975
01:01:48,675 --> 01:01:49,276
[SPEAKER_17]: We expect that of her.

976
01:01:49,296 --> 01:01:52,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my week's been going okay, so I guess I don't really have enough you.

977
01:01:52,639 --> 01:01:52,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

978
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:54,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you always just made furniture?

979
01:01:55,681 --> 01:01:56,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, okay.

980
01:01:57,603 --> 01:02:00,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Furniture made by what we assume to be communists.

981
01:02:02,447 --> 01:02:05,970
[SPEAKER_21]: Dude, it took like four hours to put a fucking desk together.

982
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:08,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, this desk, first of all, weighed like 200 pounds.

983
01:02:10,013 --> 01:02:10,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to carry it.

984
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:14,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was a desk, a wooden desk, a computer desk.

985
01:02:14,176 --> 01:02:17,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing worked right, nothing fit together the way it was supposed to.

986
01:02:18,078 --> 01:02:20,499
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, and what about the drawer thing you're making now?

987
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:21,820
[SPEAKER_21]: The drawers don't even fit right.

988
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:26,383
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm putting together a four-dresser drawer that's got another six million pieces.

989
01:02:26,523 --> 01:02:26,923
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks.

990
01:02:27,023 --> 01:02:27,523
[SPEAKER_02]: It's communist.

991
01:02:27,563 --> 01:02:30,545
[SPEAKER_02]: So fuck you to furniture that you have to put together.

992
01:02:30,565 --> 01:02:31,586
[SPEAKER_18]: How do you like my desk?

993
01:02:31,646 --> 01:02:32,907
[SPEAKER_18]: It has all these extra pieces.

994
01:02:33,827 --> 01:02:39,292
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to put each individual screw together.

995
01:02:39,312 --> 01:02:41,053
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of screwing going on.

996
01:02:41,734 --> 01:02:44,856
[SPEAKER_21]: If anybody doesn't know what that's from, watch the Clerks cartoon.

997
01:02:44,916 --> 01:02:46,237
[SPEAKER_21]: It is the best VIG ever.

998
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:50,361
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's it.

999
01:02:50,441 --> 01:02:52,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody else have any fuck yous?

1000
01:02:54,304 --> 01:02:55,264
[SPEAKER_19]: Give me microphone.

1001
01:02:56,826 --> 01:02:58,087
[SPEAKER_19]: Time for puppy to bitch.

1002
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:00,160
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, wait a minute.

1003
01:03:00,401 --> 01:03:01,521
[SPEAKER_19]: Like a bitch is a dog?

1004
01:03:01,962 --> 01:03:02,202
[SPEAKER_17]: Get it?

1005
01:03:02,222 --> 01:03:02,762
[SPEAKER_17]: That's funny.

1006
01:03:03,182 --> 01:03:03,343
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1007
01:03:03,563 --> 01:03:03,843
[SPEAKER_19]: Shut up.

1008
01:03:05,864 --> 01:03:06,104
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1009
01:03:08,246 --> 01:03:09,647
[SPEAKER_18]: Damn, why you gotta be such a bitch?

1010
01:03:11,028 --> 01:03:11,348
[SPEAKER_19]: Shit.

1011
01:03:12,068 --> 01:03:12,929
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me catch you.

1012
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:14,950
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1013
01:03:16,651 --> 01:03:20,274
[SPEAKER_19]: What the... Who the hell... Okay.

1014
01:03:21,635 --> 01:03:22,155
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, look out.

1015
01:03:22,195 --> 01:03:22,936
[SPEAKER_19]: Jamie needs to get through.

1016
01:03:25,197 --> 01:03:25,998
[SPEAKER_19]: Do your abs, Bobby.

1017
01:03:26,318 --> 01:03:26,558
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1018
01:03:28,359 --> 01:03:29,020
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, first of all...

1019
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:37,998
[SPEAKER_19]: Fuck, uh, I'd like to give a fuck you to my toilet in my bathroom, because the toilet seat broke a couple days ago, and now I cannot sit on it.

1020
01:03:38,978 --> 01:03:41,160
[SPEAKER_17]: Given the term, I'm gonna cut your ass up in a whole new meeting.

1021
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:43,663
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, indeed.

1022
01:03:44,363 --> 01:03:52,371
[SPEAKER_19]: And then, uh, let's see, um, fuck the smell of weed, because it stinks, and it doesn't come out of carpeting very well.

1023
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:56,881
[SPEAKER_19]: I think you should use an umlaut.

1024
01:03:56,902 --> 01:03:59,904
[SPEAKER_19]: I could do that, yes, but I was too lazy to try and figure out what key that is.

1025
01:04:25,968 --> 01:04:27,409
[SPEAKER_24]: Now we get to the chatroom Zephius.

1026
01:04:27,469 --> 01:04:28,109
[SPEAKER_24]: Has everyone gone?

1027
01:04:29,469 --> 01:04:32,810
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, first one comes from Japanman.

1028
01:04:34,571 --> 01:04:36,771
[SPEAKER_24]: Fuck you little kids who get on when he plays Cool 7.

1029
01:04:37,852 --> 01:04:39,692
[SPEAKER_24]: And fuck you people who don't like my baby mama.

1030
01:04:40,372 --> 01:04:41,653
[SPEAKER_24]: Agreed.

1031
01:04:42,073 --> 01:04:42,733
[SPEAKER_17]: Now who that is?

1032
01:04:42,793 --> 01:04:43,193
[SPEAKER_17]: My baby mama.

1033
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:44,534
[SPEAKER_24]: We should play that during the next break.

1034
01:04:44,574 --> 01:04:45,474
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, but you need to play it.

1035
01:04:48,191 --> 01:04:49,112
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, I'm killing JB.

1036
01:04:49,132 --> 01:04:52,895
[SPEAKER_24]: The next one is from JB, or Justin Circuit in the name.

1037
01:04:54,236 --> 01:04:54,876
[SPEAKER_24]: Jenny's bitch.

1038
01:04:55,296 --> 01:04:56,037
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, Jenny's bitch.

1039
01:04:57,038 --> 01:05:02,922
[SPEAKER_24]: FU to ATTBI Comcast to cancel the account due to a server glitch and couldn't get on for three days when it did work.

1040
01:05:02,942 --> 01:05:03,603
[SPEAKER_24]: The emails didn't work.

1041
01:05:04,283 --> 01:05:09,767
[SPEAKER_24]: And hasn't gotten two of his secondary accounts and called the customer service 18 times and been on the line with them for five hours total.

1042
01:05:10,128 --> 01:05:10,528
[SPEAKER_24]: You know what?

[SPEAKER_24]: There's a solution to that.

01:05:12,149 --> 01:05:13,490
[SPEAKER_24]: It's called Better Business Bureau.

1045
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:14,091
[SPEAKER_24]: You should write them.

1046
01:05:14,111 --> 01:05:15,472
[SPEAKER_24]: That doesn't do shit.

1047
01:05:15,652 --> 01:05:15,912

[SPEAKER_17]: What the fuck is that?

[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, but AAA, I don't have AAA and my friend's AAA let me unlock my car door when I let my keys in.

1054

[SPEAKER_14]: That is pretty cool.

1055
01:06:05,163 --> 01:06:06,484
[SPEAKER_24]: But AAA can still blow me.

01:06:06,764 --> 01:06:07,505

[SPEAKER_17]: Was it number one or number two?

01:06:55,897 --> 01:06:57,038
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, she should have gone to the pool.

1079
01:06:57,618 --> 01:06:58,839
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe I'll be swimming in pee.

1080
01:06:59,992 --> 01:07:04,475
[SPEAKER_24]: Fuck that feeling when you have 800 different food items in your house and you can't find the one unknown thing you're craving.

1081
01:07:05,976 --> 01:07:07,637
[SPEAKER_24]: And... Aww.

[SPEAKER_24]: Next is Sautome Ranma.

1088
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:32,747
[SPEAKER_24]: Fuck you to dead air.

1089
01:07:32,767 --> 01:07:33,808
[SPEAKER_24]: We don't have dead air.

1090
01:07:33,848 --> 01:07:34,909
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know what you're talking about.

1091
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:38,252
[SPEAKER_17]: It might be rebuffers or something.

1092
01:07:39,012 --> 01:07:42,796
[SPEAKER_24]: But it's not us, because as far as I can see, we're still broadcasting just fine.

1093
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:45,818
[SPEAKER_24]: One problem with my microphone is that everyone here is going to have to do that.

1094
01:07:45,838 --> 01:07:48,100
[SPEAKER_24]: Talk into the microphone and talk loudly.

1095
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:48,581
[SPEAKER_24]: Project.

1096
01:07:49,141 --> 01:07:50,503

[SPEAKER_24]: La la la la.

1098
01:07:52,865 --> 01:07:53,185
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, anyway.

1099
01:07:53,792 --> 01:07:58,536
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, yeah, and anyway, um, PsyQ of the Week goes to Hormones, enough said.

1100
01:07:58,556 --> 01:08:03,540
[SPEAKER_24]: PsyQ of the Week goes to a DDR Extreme OST for apparently not being released.

1101
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:04,721
[SPEAKER_17]: They're not going to release it?

1102
01:08:05,382 --> 01:08:06,363
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not going to be out for a while.

1103
01:08:06,763 --> 01:08:07,924
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, however, talk to me later.

1104
01:08:09,705 --> 01:08:11,267
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, SkylineDC505.

1105
01:08:11,867 --> 01:08:13,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we might be able to hook you up anyway.

1106
01:08:14,109 --> 01:08:18,713
[SPEAKER_24]: F you to the California High School exit exam for making me come to school while three-fourths of the whole school got to sleep in.

1107
01:08:20,003 --> 01:08:20,523
[SPEAKER_24]: You know what?

1108
01:08:20,583 --> 01:08:22,985
[SPEAKER_24]: For the Alabama ones, they just gave it to us while we were in class.

1109
01:08:23,105 --> 01:08:24,466
[SPEAKER_17]: There's an X exam now in high school?

1110
01:08:24,486 --> 01:08:25,846
[SPEAKER_24]: And, like, I got a hundred on it.

1111
01:08:28,708 --> 01:08:29,649
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't remember that.

1112
01:08:30,109 --> 01:08:31,089
[SPEAKER_24]: Holy shit!

1113
01:08:32,590 --> 01:08:33,851
[SPEAKER_24]: Snub dyspnoid.

1114
01:08:34,631 --> 01:08:35,312
[SPEAKER_24]: Long F you.

1115
01:08:35,632 --> 01:08:36,252
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh my god.

1116
01:08:36,753 --> 01:08:40,435
[SPEAKER_24]: First off... First off... Hey, let me read!

1117
01:08:40,555 --> 01:08:40,975
[SPEAKER_24]: Shut up!

1118
01:08:42,034 --> 01:08:44,135
[SPEAKER_24]: First off, fuck driver's training school and the poop shoot.

1119
01:08:44,776 --> 01:08:49,759
[SPEAKER_24]: I would honestly rather have a duck shit down my throat than to sit through that boring ass shit.

1120
01:08:49,819 --> 01:08:50,579
[SPEAKER_24]: Everyone in the class.

1121
01:08:55,302 --> 01:08:55,822
[SPEAKER_15]: This one was off.

1122
01:08:55,842 --> 01:08:56,543
[SPEAKER_24]: We had a mic off.

1123
01:08:58,178 --> 01:09:01,140
[SPEAKER_24]: Everybody, don't touch the on-off switch on the microphone.

1124
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:01,720
[SPEAKER_24]: Guys, we're sorry.

1125
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:03,622
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1126
01:09:05,643 --> 01:09:08,865
[SPEAKER_24]: And actually, then, we probably didn't get DCB's post.

1127
01:09:09,045 --> 01:09:09,305
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1128
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:17,590
[SPEAKER_24]: DCB, send me yours again.

1129
01:09:20,112 --> 01:09:21,853
[SPEAKER_17]: What was the last thing you guys heard?

1130
01:09:23,447 --> 01:09:25,148
[SPEAKER_17]: We didn't know what the chatroom, the last thing they heard.

1131
01:09:25,168 --> 01:09:26,408
[SPEAKER_24]: I was reading the thank you, so I'm sorry.

1132
01:09:26,728 --> 01:09:28,129
[SPEAKER_24]: Bitch, you did miss the whole big thing about 24.

1133
01:09:30,549 --> 01:09:32,390
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that's okay if you missed the whole thing about 24.

1134
01:09:32,430 --> 01:09:32,970
[SPEAKER_17]: That was nothing.

1135
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:33,910
[SPEAKER_24]: Because we don't give a shit.

1136
01:09:34,871 --> 01:09:35,271
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry, Rob.

1137
01:09:35,691 --> 01:09:35,971
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1138
01:09:38,232 --> 01:09:39,032
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, then.

1139
01:09:39,932 --> 01:09:40,573
[SPEAKER_24]: That's a while.

1140
01:09:41,353 --> 01:09:41,853
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

1141
01:09:43,134 --> 01:09:44,254
[SPEAKER_24]: DCB, send me yours again.

1142
01:09:44,830 --> 01:09:45,130
[SPEAKER_17]: There it is.

1143
01:09:45,190 --> 01:09:47,171
[SPEAKER_17]: It just came in at the land there.

1144
01:09:47,291 --> 01:09:49,432
[SPEAKER_24]: Fuck you to Photoshop7 for taking 7 minutes to load.

1145
01:09:49,572 --> 01:09:51,273
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry, Photoshop7 for taking 7 minutes to load.

1146
01:09:51,553 --> 01:09:53,394
[SPEAKER_24]: Fuck his dad for buying lots of food and not letting him eat it.

1147
01:09:53,434 --> 01:09:56,715
[SPEAKER_24]: And fuck you to the green card manager for telling him to get off the horse ride at MGL.

1148
01:09:58,936 --> 01:09:59,876
[SPEAKER_24]: Brad, LankyStyle.

1149
01:10:00,757 --> 01:10:01,737
[SPEAKER_24]: This fuck you goes to Racist.

1150
01:10:01,817 --> 01:10:02,617
[SPEAKER_24]: I hate you all equally.

1151
01:10:02,637 --> 01:10:03,058
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1152
01:10:07,044 --> 01:10:08,445
[SPEAKER_24]: Next is Jazz.

[SPEAKER_24]: Die, die, die.

1155
01:10:10,146 --> 01:10:12,027
[SPEAKER_24]: And I laugh at all the exit exam people.

1156
01:10:12,387 --> 01:10:14,689
[SPEAKER_24]: They just started that this year, so I missed it by a year, so I laugh.

1157
01:10:14,729 --> 01:10:18,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1158
01:10:18,171 --> 01:10:26,837
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought they started the exit exams, like, last year, because I heard about it, that they were giving it out in my school, but I didn't have to take it.

1159
01:10:27,037 --> 01:10:29,559
[SPEAKER_24]: By the way, it died at duck shit down the throat.

1160
01:10:29,659 --> 01:10:30,159
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

1161
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:34,442
[SPEAKER_24]: If you want to send me that again, but you did say fuckity, fuck, fuck, fuck, and fuck him up the nose hole.

1162
01:10:35,177 --> 01:10:37,619
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, we missed that whole thing with Snub Disanoids, FU?

1163
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:39,059
[SPEAKER_17]: We've been down that long?

1164
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:40,220
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.

1165
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:40,920
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, that sucks.

1166
01:10:40,940 --> 01:10:41,621
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, guys.

1167
01:10:42,201 --> 01:10:46,964
[SPEAKER_17]: Send that again, because I nom- What you also missed is I nominated that as one of the top three FUs ever.

1168
01:10:47,004 --> 01:10:47,704
[SPEAKER_17]: That was beautiful.

1169
01:10:53,848 --> 01:10:56,709
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, as long as they heard Fuck Em Up the Nosehole, that was the best.

1170
01:10:56,890 --> 01:10:57,130
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1171
01:10:57,650 --> 01:10:59,251
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, Muhymer, Dead Air.

[SPEAKER_17]: Break time?

1176
01:11:09,295 --> 01:11:15,079
[SPEAKER_17]: When we come back from break, believe it or not, when we come back from break, I have big Bomani news.

1177
01:11:15,139 --> 01:11:17,921
[SPEAKER_17]: It might be rumors, but I went and looked up news.

1178
01:11:18,342 --> 01:11:21,744
[SPEAKER_17]: So, we're going to talk about Bomani.

[SPEAKER_00]: I asked my friend Joe, I asked my friend Jake, they said it was Fuhogwa Guys.

1192
01:12:50,517 --> 01:12:54,538
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, come on, Fuhogwa Guys, I said, come on, Fuhogwa Guys.

1193
01:12:54,558 --> 01:12:55,998
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's it to the limit?

1194
01:12:56,018 --> 01:12:58,819
[SPEAKER_00]: Say me, I'm to the limit, everybody come on, Fuhogwa Guys.

1195
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:10,594
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching!

1196
01:13:48,599 --> 01:13:50,400
[SPEAKER_10]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1197
01:14:20,778 --> 01:14:22,339
[SPEAKER_10]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1198
01:15:12,572 --> 01:15:13,713
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1199
01:15:46,668 --> 01:15:48,058
Thanks for watching!

1200
01:16:13,263 --> 01:16:14,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1201
01:19:31,414 --> 01:19:37,137
[SPEAKER_26]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

1202
01:19:44,727 --> 01:19:45,448
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, we're back.

1203
01:19:45,548 --> 01:19:51,331
[SPEAKER_24]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and... By popular request, actually, we do need to give a mention of this.

1204
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:52,372
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, what's this?

1205
01:19:52,392 --> 01:19:55,314
[SPEAKER_24]: We're going to do... The F2 that everyone missed from Subdisfinoid.

1206
01:19:55,674 --> 01:19:56,935
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, that was so horrible.

1207
01:19:56,975 --> 01:19:57,456
[SPEAKER_17]: Too bad about that.

1208
01:19:57,476 --> 01:19:58,536
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, let's hear it again.

1209
01:19:58,696 --> 01:20:00,778
[SPEAKER_24]: First off, fuck driver's training in the poop chute.

1210
01:20:01,018 --> 01:20:04,480
[SPEAKER_24]: I would honestly rather have a duck shit down my throat than to have to sit through that boring-ass shit.

1211
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:06,261
[SPEAKER_24]: Everyone in the class is a total bitch, even the teacher.

1212
01:20:06,622 --> 01:20:08,423
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not like if you have a penis and testicles, I hate you.

1213
01:20:08,443 --> 01:20:09,884
[SPEAKER_24]: I will smash your testicles because they're sensitive.

1214
01:20:09,924 --> 01:20:11,665
[SPEAKER_24]: Bad men... Or men bad, I should say.

1215
01:20:11,985 --> 01:20:13,786
[SPEAKER_24]: Respect women because we spit you out our baby holes.

1216
01:20:14,207 --> 01:20:14,467
[SPEAKER_24]: Indeed.

1217
01:20:15,187 --> 01:20:20,909
[SPEAKER_24]: Fuck driver's training only, fuck it so exclusively so that all of my horrible negative energy can be used to destroy driver's training forever.

1218
01:20:21,969 --> 01:20:23,410
[SPEAKER_24]: That fucking school can suck my ass.

1219
01:20:23,450 --> 01:20:26,451
[SPEAKER_24]: I haven't slept more than four hours each night this past week and I won't get enough sleep this week.

1220
01:20:26,691 --> 01:20:28,211
[SPEAKER_24]: Fuck that bullshit, fuck it up the nose hole.

1221
01:20:28,711 --> 01:20:29,572
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, the nose hole.

1222
01:20:30,052 --> 01:20:31,812
[SPEAKER_24]: But you missed the fuckity fuck fuck fuck.

1223
01:20:31,852 --> 01:20:32,573
[SPEAKER_24]: That was the best.

1224
01:20:33,353 --> 01:20:34,153
[SPEAKER_17]: Fuck fuckity fuck fuck.

1225
01:20:34,253 --> 01:20:35,294
[SPEAKER_17]: Fuck you, you fucking fuck.

1226
01:20:35,634 --> 01:20:36,014
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1227
01:20:36,874 --> 01:20:37,174
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

1228
01:20:37,254 --> 01:20:37,474
[SPEAKER_17]: Shit.

1229
01:20:37,934 --> 01:20:39,375
[SPEAKER_17]: So, we wanted to do...

1230
01:20:41,027 --> 01:20:44,513
[SPEAKER_17]: We wanted to do another song really fast, but it's something that Loki has to introduce.

1231
01:20:44,553 --> 01:20:46,316
[SPEAKER_17]: And why is that, Mr. Loki?

1232
01:20:47,798 --> 01:20:49,241
[SPEAKER_18]: It's another remix I did.

1233
01:20:50,002 --> 01:20:52,126
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, it's not as good as my last one.

1234
01:20:52,839 --> 01:20:57,962
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1235
01:22:53,737 --> 01:22:54,299
Are we coming?

1236
01:22:54,359 --> 01:22:55,322
Into the dark, black forest.

1237
01:24:15,469 --> 01:24:16,510
[SPEAKER_24]: That was pretty good.

1238
01:24:17,171 --> 01:24:18,172
[SPEAKER_24]: I was really impressed with that.

1239
01:24:18,192 --> 01:24:18,712
[SPEAKER_17]: That was pretty neat.

1240
01:24:18,732 --> 01:24:19,473
[SPEAKER_17]: It was very subtle.

1241
01:24:19,613 --> 01:24:24,218
[SPEAKER_17]: The modem stream probably doesn't do that justice because a lot of it's very subtle.

1242
01:24:24,558 --> 01:24:24,859
[SPEAKER_17]: But...

1243
01:24:25,799 --> 01:24:31,102
[SPEAKER_18]: But, as, okay, well we probably should go into SimCon news since this is SimCon news.

1244
01:24:32,062 --> 01:24:44,308
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, okay, obviously SimCon news, the big news, well for me at least, is Leech from Loki 2.0 has finally, finally, two month delay launched.

1245
01:24:44,929 --> 01:24:45,029
[SPEAKER_18]: Um.

1246
01:24:46,049 --> 01:24:54,417
[SPEAKER_18]: It's got, right now, the initial update had the 2DX DWI project files for 2DX 2nd style through 5th style.

1247
01:24:55,117 --> 01:24:59,541
[SPEAKER_18]: And so there's about, I'd say about 50-some files up there at the moment.

1248
01:24:59,641 --> 01:25:03,805
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm uploading more probably later this week as I get to work on them.

1249
01:25:04,385 --> 01:25:08,008
[SPEAKER_18]: I went ahead and... Oh man, that looks ugly on that.

1250
01:25:08,288 --> 01:25:08,669
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, anyways.

1251
01:25:08,689 --> 01:25:09,369
[SPEAKER_18]: So...

1252
01:25:11,978 --> 01:25:23,848
[SPEAKER_18]: I went ahead and, as promised, exclusive to Orange Launch Radio, if you're a wonderful listener of the show, you get access to a special page every week.

1253
01:25:24,749 --> 01:25:31,694
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, I was kind of bad and didn't really hide the page well enough this time, but next time the files will be more hidden.

1254
01:25:31,714 --> 01:25:32,055
[SPEAKER_18]: But anyways...

1255
01:25:32,695 --> 01:25:42,924
[SPEAKER_18]: This page, exclusive to you guys, is going to be the release of my two remixes, The Legend of Trance and the Dark Black Forest Midnight Angel mix.

1256
01:25:43,764 --> 01:25:56,455
[SPEAKER_18]: And so, to access this page, what you want to do is go to my site, which is www.willddrforfood.net slash leechfromloki.com

1257
01:25:57,432 --> 01:26:15,080
[SPEAKER_18]: and then what you want to do once you get to that and you want to type in also the special HTML page which is going to be hotmonkeysex.html and that will bring you up to the wonderful page with my two links for my MP3s.

1258
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:18,282
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a secret page and what are the special MP3s that they can download this week?

1259
01:26:18,422 --> 01:26:23,164
[SPEAKER_18]: The Legend of Trance which is a remix of The Legend of Max which is just fucking awesome.

1260
01:26:23,904 --> 01:26:25,365
[SPEAKER_18]: That's my favorite remix so far.

1261
01:26:26,225 --> 01:26:32,811
[SPEAKER_18]: and that's Legend of Trance, Loki vs. ZZ featuring Sundecade.

1262
01:26:33,151 --> 01:26:39,576
[SPEAKER_18]: Then we have the Dark Black Forest, Midnight Angel mix, Steve Reiner vs. Loki featuring Sonaris.

1263
01:26:40,897 --> 01:26:48,804
[SPEAKER_17]: So those are exclusive remixes to Orange Lounge listeners and we just posted the link in the chat room if you didn't get it and so go leech away and you can listen to those.

1264
01:26:48,824 --> 01:26:51,246
[SPEAKER_17]: But don't listen to them now, wait until after the show because we need our listeners.

1265
01:26:51,366 --> 01:26:52,507
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, so we'll have...

1266
01:26:54,318 --> 01:27:06,744
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, as far as DWIs going, you know, for Legend of Trance, as mentioned on the page, I'm thinking about that one for Tourney Mix 4, so that'll be that one, but Dark Black Forest, Midnight Angel Mix is up for grabs, so.

1267
01:27:07,824 --> 01:27:10,085
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just a steady 140 BPM.

1268
01:27:10,165 --> 01:27:16,748
[SPEAKER_17]: In other words, you're basically saying, you can't, or basically you're telling the listeners, don't do a DWI for Legend of Trance, because you claim it for Tourney Mix 4.

1269
01:27:16,788 --> 01:27:18,689
[SPEAKER_17]: You peed on it and made it your territory.

1270
01:27:20,269 --> 01:27:20,929
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

1271
01:27:21,310 --> 01:27:26,151
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, well, speaking of your mixes, how about something that was your choice?

1272
01:27:27,231 --> 01:27:28,431
[SPEAKER_24]: How about the, uh, Cage Matches?

1273
01:27:28,451 --> 01:27:29,552
[SPEAKER_24]: You wanna do that?

1274
01:27:29,572 --> 01:27:29,712
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1275
01:27:29,732 --> 01:27:30,372
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's do Cage Match.

1276
01:27:30,752 --> 01:27:30,992
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

1277
01:27:31,572 --> 01:27:36,173
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, um, I don't have Holic, I have Holic, but it won't play a background because of my stupid sound card.

1278
01:27:36,273 --> 01:27:37,033
[SPEAKER_24]: Fuck my sound card!

1279
01:27:37,073 --> 01:27:37,954
[SPEAKER_03]: You sound like Hee-Haw.

1280
01:27:37,974 --> 01:27:39,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Not like, Ah, Mamie Pearl, this is Hee-Haw!

1281
01:27:50,448 --> 01:28:02,535
[SPEAKER_24]: But no, we're going to go ahead and play, basically the way that our cage match works is that each of us picks a song, and one of us will have won the previous week, so that's the song that should be in rotation right now, but really isn't right now.

1282
01:28:02,555 --> 01:28:05,897
[SPEAKER_17]: It isn't right now, but we'll figure it out.

1283
01:28:05,917 --> 01:28:09,400
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll put them both in or something, the last week's winner, unless it wins again, which it may.

1284
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,241
[SPEAKER_17]: It may win again, but I don't think it will.

1285
01:28:11,841 --> 01:28:13,501
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't like it.

1286
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:14,982
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it stunk.

1287
01:28:40,780 --> 01:28:43,984
[SPEAKER_24]: Don't let us influence you, or better yet, just let me influence you.

1288
01:28:45,126 --> 01:28:47,068
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're just going to play a clip of last week's winner, right?

1289
01:28:47,489 --> 01:28:51,654
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I'll play a decent-sized clip of it, because I actually have Life Out 3.

1290
01:28:53,256 --> 01:28:54,998
[SPEAKER_24]: This is, what was that track again?

1291
01:28:55,018 --> 01:28:55,819
[SPEAKER_17]: Sasha with Expander.

1292
01:28:55,859 --> 01:28:57,041
[SPEAKER_18]: Sasha with Expander.

1293
01:28:57,361 --> 01:28:58,022
[SPEAKER_17]: This is last week's winner.

1294
01:29:40,504 --> 01:29:43,687
[SPEAKER_24]: That was a little bit of an expander.

1295
01:29:44,288 --> 01:29:46,430
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyway, this is Rob's pick of the week.

1296
01:29:46,650 --> 01:29:47,371
[SPEAKER_24]: You want to tell us about it?

1297
01:29:47,511 --> 01:29:49,013
[SPEAKER_24]: Actually, we should rate that song.

1298
01:29:49,113 --> 01:29:49,533
[SPEAKER_24]: It's cool.

1299
01:29:49,733 --> 01:29:50,334
[SPEAKER_24]: I give it a 7.

1300
01:29:50,554 --> 01:29:51,595
[SPEAKER_17]: No, we don't do last week's.

1301
01:29:51,695 --> 01:29:52,276
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't do last week's.

1302
01:29:52,777 --> 01:29:52,997
[SPEAKER_17]: Usually.

1303
01:29:53,197 --> 01:29:54,578
[SPEAKER_17]: Because we already ranked it last week.

1304
01:29:54,658 --> 01:29:54,879
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

1305
01:29:55,473 --> 01:29:58,374
[SPEAKER_17]: And we said it shouldn't win, and it did, because our chatroom hates us.

1306
01:29:58,834 --> 01:30:02,115
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, my song, and I had to kind of come up with this at the last minute.

1307
01:30:02,155 --> 01:30:08,777
[SPEAKER_17]: This really isn't what I would have usually picked, but I completely forgot that, like, hi, we're moving the show tonight, so I actually have to burn a CD off my song.

1308
01:30:09,077 --> 01:30:12,118
[SPEAKER_17]: But luckily I have a CD in my car, and this is actually a pretty good song.

1309
01:30:12,618 --> 01:30:15,419
[SPEAKER_17]: And I got turned on to this song a couple years ago because I...

1310
01:30:16,451 --> 01:30:18,172
[SPEAKER_17]: Tell me a fable, a fable Tell me a fable

1311
01:30:43,037 --> 01:30:54,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me a fake, tell me the fake one A fake, tell me the fake one Talk to me, tenderly, so reality and fantasy Will meld together, only in one thing

1312
01:31:11,221 --> 01:31:13,702
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

1313
01:33:53,326 --> 01:33:54,589
Thanks for watching!

1314
01:34:17,366 --> 01:34:18,087
Tell me a fable.

1315
01:34:18,127 --> 01:34:18,427
A fable.

1316
01:34:18,627 --> 01:34:19,047
A fable.

1317
01:34:19,167 --> 01:34:20,609
A fable that will never end.

1318
01:34:20,729 --> 01:34:21,489
And now, I dream.

1319
01:34:21,529 --> 01:34:22,050
Dream.

1320
01:34:46,013 --> 01:34:47,054
Thanks for watching!

1321
01:36:54,246 --> 01:36:56,668
[SPEAKER_24]: That was Robert Miles of Fable.

1322
01:36:57,249 --> 01:36:59,170
[SPEAKER_17]: The big plop at the end is the best.

1323
01:36:59,771 --> 01:37:02,333
[SPEAKER_24]: As far as my opinion of that song, he's done better.

1324
01:37:02,974 --> 01:37:03,955
[SPEAKER_24]: So it gets a six.

1325
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:11,502
[SPEAKER_18]: Microphones are going every which way.

1326
01:37:14,195 --> 01:37:15,215
[SPEAKER_18]: The song is alright.

1327
01:37:15,636 --> 01:37:16,996
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, like, he could have done better.

1328
01:37:17,336 --> 01:37:20,077
[SPEAKER_18]: But, um, Ever After really sucked ass.

1329
01:37:20,958 --> 01:37:23,159
[SPEAKER_18]: So, uh, that's gonna affect my decision.

1330
01:37:23,999 --> 01:37:25,139
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I'm gonna have to give it a 6.

1331
01:37:29,581 --> 01:37:30,822
[SPEAKER_17]: That song rocks and you don't, 10.

1332
01:37:32,922 --> 01:37:35,203
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, wow, that's a real biased opinion there.

1333
01:37:36,124 --> 01:37:39,185
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I have a really bad experience with that movie.

1334
01:37:39,725 --> 01:37:41,466
[SPEAKER_18]: And, honestly... Care to explain?

1335
01:37:42,879 --> 01:37:45,039
[SPEAKER_21]: Go there with the chick who cheats on you and gets pregnant.

1336
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:46,520
[SPEAKER_21]: That's all I gotta say.

1337
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:48,360
[SPEAKER_21]: Seriously.

1338
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:49,540
[SPEAKER_21]: It's about the song, not the movie.

1339
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:52,961
[SPEAKER_21]: I know, that's why I just said, people tell me to explain.

1340
01:37:53,341 --> 01:37:58,662
[SPEAKER_18]: No, honestly, I really didn't like that song, so I'll give it like a four.

1341
01:37:59,743 --> 01:38:01,923
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's being really, really, really nice.

1342
01:38:04,784 --> 01:38:09,225
[SPEAKER_19]: For those people that are listening, Rob's just giving raspberries to Zero right now.

1343
01:38:09,665 --> 01:38:10,565
[SPEAKER_19]: Many times.

1344
01:38:12,597 --> 01:38:14,817
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, I think it's nice.

1345
01:38:16,238 --> 01:38:21,859
[SPEAKER_19]: Honestly, that song would put me to sleep if I weren't in here talking to other people right now.

1346
01:38:22,699 --> 01:38:22,999
[SPEAKER_19]: Three.

1347
01:38:25,019 --> 01:38:25,359
[SPEAKER_13]: Six.

1348
01:38:25,459 --> 01:38:28,120
[SPEAKER_13]: I could probably see it in, like, Keyboard Mania or something.

1349
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:30,780
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, I like that song, okay?

1350
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:33,721
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I have a new FU to all of you bitches in here.

1351
01:38:34,981 --> 01:38:37,781
[SPEAKER_22]: I give that song a ten, because that's, like, my kind of song.

1352
01:38:38,041 --> 01:38:38,541
[SPEAKER_22]: I liked it.

1353
01:38:39,141 --> 01:38:39,582
Damn right!

1354
01:38:42,668 --> 01:38:43,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to give it like a 9.

1355
01:38:44,329 --> 01:38:47,790
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty good song, I like it, yeah.

1356
01:38:48,610 --> 01:38:53,692
[SPEAKER_02]: I like any trance just about, so I mean, soft, hard, anything.

1357
01:39:00,234 --> 01:39:02,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'll say that again, I'd give that song a 9.

1358
01:39:03,695 --> 01:39:06,136
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not perfect, but it's pretty damn good.

1359
01:39:08,277 --> 01:39:14,899
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, well, I'd have to give it a 7, because I heard a DJ Epic version that's about, like, that's twice as good as that.

1360
01:39:14,999 --> 01:39:15,599
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I'll give it a 7.

1361
01:39:17,719 --> 01:39:20,540
[SPEAKER_17]: So, the average score is, and remember, I'm not very good at math, 9.

1362
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:26,401
[SPEAKER_24]: So... Okay.

1363
01:39:27,282 --> 01:39:28,022
[SPEAKER_24]: It's my turn now.

1364
01:39:29,462 --> 01:39:35,684
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, I don't know who did this, because I downloaded it by accident one day, but this is Link's theme, Heave Dance Remix.

1365
01:39:36,024 --> 01:39:36,364
[SPEAKER_24]: Here you go.

1366
01:39:46,252 --> 01:39:46,893
Thanks for watching!

1367
01:40:29,837 --> 01:40:30,498
Thanks for watching!

1368
01:41:00,905 --> 01:41:01,525
Thanks for watching!

1369
01:41:42,631 --> 01:41:51,976
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, I know it's not the best and I didn't put it in there with an intention of winning, but when I first downloaded it, it made me really bouncy and hyper, so I give it a seven.

1370
01:41:54,337 --> 01:41:54,918
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll go ahead.

1371
01:41:55,578 --> 01:42:00,441
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, when I'm listening to that, I bounce up and down a lot, and then I want to take a really big shit.

1372
01:42:02,161 --> 01:42:04,843
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I give it eight rolls of toilet paper.

1373
01:42:08,715 --> 01:42:10,656
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, um, let's see here.

1374
01:42:11,216 --> 01:42:12,816
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, let's see here, it violated so many rules.

1375
01:42:13,016 --> 01:42:13,776
[SPEAKER_18]: What's a speed mix?

1376
01:42:13,816 --> 01:42:15,857
[SPEAKER_18]: And speed mixes all suck ass.

1377
01:42:16,497 --> 01:42:16,817
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay?

1378
01:42:17,077 --> 01:42:20,738
[SPEAKER_18]: Two, if... What the hell, they make it with mod trackers, some shit like that?

1379
01:42:20,778 --> 01:42:22,159
[SPEAKER_18]: Sounds like it's eight years old.

1380
01:42:22,699 --> 01:42:25,720
[SPEAKER_18]: Fucking, the song had no... Oh, it had big bass.

1381
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:27,380
[SPEAKER_18]: People like big bass, I'll put big bass in there.

1382
01:42:27,580 --> 01:42:29,221
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, drum beats, drum beats sound good.

1383
01:42:29,381 --> 01:42:30,361
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's throw those in there, too.

1384
01:42:30,381 --> 01:42:32,301
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, and let's get a MIDI of Link's theme.

1385
01:42:32,461 --> 01:42:33,042
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll put that there.

1386
01:42:33,302 --> 01:42:34,562
[SPEAKER_18]: Look, I made a remix!

1387
01:42:34,842 --> 01:42:35,382
[SPEAKER_18]: Woohoo!

1388
01:42:35,402 --> 01:42:36,182
[SPEAKER_18]: Look at me go!

1389
01:42:36,743 --> 01:42:37,963
[SPEAKER_17]: I got a big bass, wanna come over?

1390
01:42:41,681 --> 01:42:49,503
[SPEAKER_18]: So, um, yeah, I'm gonna have to give that, like, a two, and, uh, and Robert Miles' song, well, is better now.

1391
01:42:49,843 --> 01:42:58,545
[SPEAKER_18]: Having, having, having, you know, it's like, it's like if you have the ugly chick and you stand next to her and it makes you look better, that's what this song was.

1392
01:42:58,645 --> 01:43:00,125
[SPEAKER_18]: This song was the ugly chick.

1393
01:43:01,886 --> 01:43:04,686
[SPEAKER_19]: And the rest of the group moans and groans with that comment.

1394
01:43:05,887 --> 01:43:08,247
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, come on, is, was it really that bad?

1395
01:43:08,407 --> 01:43:08,687
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1396
01:43:10,448 --> 01:43:10,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, eight.

1397
01:43:12,478 --> 01:43:16,421
[SPEAKER_19]: I... Oh, come on, Loki could do better than that.

1398
01:43:17,202 --> 01:43:19,183
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyways, uh... Yeah.

1399
01:43:19,804 --> 01:43:20,164
[SPEAKER_19]: I like it.

1400
01:43:20,264 --> 01:43:20,865
[SPEAKER_19]: It's short!

1401
01:43:21,265 --> 01:43:21,705
[SPEAKER_19]: It's short.

1402
01:43:21,725 --> 01:43:22,786
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the good thing about this song.

1403
01:43:22,826 --> 01:43:23,226
[SPEAKER_19]: It's short.

1404
01:43:23,286 --> 01:43:24,067
[SPEAKER_19]: It doesn't drag out.

1405
01:43:24,567 --> 01:43:25,748
[SPEAKER_19]: I give it an 8.5.

1406
01:43:27,510 --> 01:43:30,052
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, so I like the fact that it was bouncy.

1407
01:43:30,072 --> 01:43:30,872
[SPEAKER_22]: It was bouncy.

1408
01:43:31,092 --> 01:43:32,473
[SPEAKER_22]: So there's a couple of points there.

1409
01:43:33,074 --> 01:43:37,537
[SPEAKER_22]: And it had Link's theme, which... A couple of other points, but other than that, it sucked ass.

1410
01:43:37,577 --> 01:43:38,018
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm giving it a 2.

1411
01:43:39,292 --> 01:43:40,133
[SPEAKER_22]: Real, real, real quick.

1412
01:43:40,473 --> 01:43:42,714
[SPEAKER_22]: If it's going that fast, how the fuck are you going to dance to that?

1413
01:43:43,534 --> 01:43:45,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo, it's fast, I mean, I mean.

1414
01:43:45,856 --> 01:43:51,159
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, it's a little fast, a little too bouncy, a little too happy, happy.

1415
01:43:51,399 --> 01:43:53,080
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I like it that much.

1416
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:58,283
[SPEAKER_02]: I give it like a seven or a six, but I give Loki's commentary a ten.

1417
01:43:58,663 --> 01:43:59,403
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.

1418
01:43:59,824 --> 01:44:04,046
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I just want to say really fast, though, Loki, you don't dance to it, you have sex to it.

1419
01:44:05,413 --> 01:44:07,694
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't want to tell Dan that Rob did humping motions in his chair.

1420
01:44:33,655 --> 01:44:39,020
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I say, if the FUs were still going, I would say fuck you to all who gave it lower than at least a 7.

1421
01:44:39,701 --> 01:44:42,543
[SPEAKER_21]: Cause, if you don't have any, like, $8,000... Well, the fuck yous are over.

1422
01:44:43,324 --> 01:44:44,064
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck you, buddy.

1423
01:44:44,905 --> 01:44:45,806
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck you, too!

1424
01:44:46,767 --> 01:44:49,029
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1425
01:44:49,349 --> 01:44:50,470
[SPEAKER_18]: Here's an idea, okay?

1426
01:44:50,650 --> 01:44:51,191
[SPEAKER_18]: Here's an idea.

1427
01:44:52,412 --> 01:44:55,034
[SPEAKER_18]: I've heard better Final Fantasy remixes, okay?

1428
01:44:55,375 --> 01:44:59,999
[SPEAKER_18]: Better Final Fantasy remixes, they need to just do a decent remix of it, then we'll give it a decent score.

1429
01:45:00,751 --> 01:45:02,392
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, well let's just go ahead and get voting out of the way.

1430
01:45:02,412 --> 01:45:05,355
[SPEAKER_24]: We're going to play a little bitty clip to the songs one more time.

1431
01:45:05,815 --> 01:45:06,296
Name them all.

1432
01:45:06,736 --> 01:45:09,138
[SPEAKER_24]: We're going to name them all, and here's like a little bit of it.

1433
01:45:09,638 --> 01:45:11,400
[SPEAKER_24]: This one is Sasha with Expander.

1434
01:45:13,281 --> 01:45:14,202
Okay, that's enough.

1435
01:45:26,963 --> 01:45:30,605
[SPEAKER_24]: Next one is Robert Miles with Fable.

1436
01:45:31,285 --> 01:45:32,506
[SPEAKER_24]: Yay.

1437
01:45:35,808 --> 01:45:39,409
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, that's enough of that.

1438
01:45:39,770 --> 01:45:40,550
[SPEAKER_24]: And then Link's theme.

1439
01:45:43,191 --> 01:45:43,992
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, that's enough of that.

1440
01:45:44,912 --> 01:45:45,272
[SPEAKER_24]: Vote!

1441
01:45:45,673 --> 01:45:46,093
[SPEAKER_24]: Vote now!

1442
01:45:47,077 --> 01:45:51,699
[SPEAKER_24]: In the meantime, we're going to hand the microphone to Loki to go angst on us again while I pull up the next sub break.

1443
01:45:52,140 --> 01:45:56,782
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I'm going to do Bimani News because we promised it like an hour ago and we never did it.

1444
01:45:56,842 --> 01:46:09,709
[SPEAKER_17]: So you've all been sitting there getting moist, your panties have been getting moist in anticipation of this hot, hot... I can't believe puppy just said that.

1445
01:46:09,769 --> 01:46:10,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Say that again.

1446
01:46:10,909 --> 01:46:12,290
[SPEAKER_17]: Things dried up by now.

1447
01:46:12,610 --> 01:46:13,351
[SPEAKER_24]: Now they're crusty.

1448
01:46:14,807 --> 01:46:17,543
[SPEAKER_17]: God, things I did not need to know

1449
01:46:18,781 --> 01:46:21,363
[SPEAKER_17]: I am stealing this news.

1450
01:46:21,383 --> 01:46:24,265
[SPEAKER_17]: I will quote my source because a lot of people don't.

1451
01:46:24,285 --> 01:46:27,127
[SPEAKER_17]: I was just surfing around the net during one of the weeks and I found this news.

1452
01:46:27,547 --> 01:46:30,009
[SPEAKER_17]: It was posted on the LiveJournal community for Bomani.

1453
01:46:30,249 --> 01:46:32,770
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's just username Bomani on the LiveJournal community.

1454
01:46:33,351 --> 01:46:35,052
[SPEAKER_17]: LiveJournal.com slash tilde Bomani.

1455
01:46:35,092 --> 01:46:39,695
[SPEAKER_17]: And by the way, I'll take this opportunity to plug that Orange Lounge also has a LiveJournal community.

1456
01:46:39,715 --> 01:46:43,898
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you go to LiveJournal.com slash tilde Orange Lounge, there's our community.

1457
01:46:44,158 --> 01:46:48,521
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you use LiveJournal, add us to your friends list because we like it when people add us to their friends list.

1458
01:46:48,781 --> 01:46:53,448
[SPEAKER_18]: I had a live journal once, then I never posted, and they got rid of it for me.

1459
01:47:04,574 --> 01:47:04,934
[SPEAKER_17]: Here we go.

1460
01:47:05,054 --> 01:47:06,335
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not a racist, bastard.

1461
01:47:06,395 --> 01:47:06,716
[SPEAKER_17]: Here we go.

1462
01:47:07,336 --> 01:47:12,500
[SPEAKER_17]: This was, I'm going to credit, and actually I think this person's on the Orange Lounge community, which makes them that much cooler.

1463
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:16,683
[SPEAKER_17]: This was posted by Hata, H-A-T-A, maybe that's Hata or something.

1464
01:47:17,003 --> 01:47:17,544
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, Hata.

1465
01:47:17,804 --> 01:47:18,784
[SPEAKER_17]: It looks like Hata to me.

1466
01:47:20,686 --> 01:47:21,847
[SPEAKER_24]: She's also in our community, too.

1467
01:47:22,611 --> 01:47:23,672
[SPEAKER_17]: 2DX Night Style Location Test

1468
01:47:39,768 --> 01:47:45,792
[SPEAKER_17]: So, again, I don't know how reliable this news source is, take it with a grain of salt, but this is just all in fun, right?

1469
01:47:46,333 --> 01:47:51,376
[SPEAKER_17]: So, finally, Konami will launch the location test for Bomani 2DX 9th Style on May 5th.

1470
01:47:51,797 --> 01:47:55,039
[SPEAKER_17]: We have rumors saying that this is going to be the last installment.

1471
01:47:55,539 --> 01:47:56,980
[SPEAKER_17]: But it has not been confirmed yet.

1472
01:47:57,300 --> 01:47:59,902
[SPEAKER_17]: On the official site, they announced a few songs that will be brought back.

1473
01:47:59,962 --> 01:48:00,963
[SPEAKER_17]: However, that is not all.

1474
01:48:01,283 --> 01:48:05,166
[SPEAKER_17]: We all know that Beatmania has closed its history last year with the release of Beatmania the Final.

1475
01:48:05,466 --> 01:48:06,367
[SPEAKER_17]: It was not over yet.

1476
01:48:06,427 --> 01:48:09,189
[SPEAKER_17]: They are also bringing back some songs that was on Beatmania.

1477
01:48:09,509 --> 01:48:19,757
[SPEAKER_17]: The songs include LED Hellscaper, Tack with Release Your Mind, Pink Pong with Pink Dream, The Bald Head, Ska Go Go, DJ Naguro with Miriam featuring Believe Again.

1478
01:48:20,597 --> 01:48:24,199
[SPEAKER_17]: Just to name a few, I'm pretty sure that some of those songs would be remixed by our favorite artists.

1479
01:48:24,259 --> 01:48:30,561
[SPEAKER_17]: Due to massive resurrection of classic Beatmania songs, it is possible that they may have to take out many 2DX songs as well.

1480
01:48:31,262 --> 01:48:31,582
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh-oh.

1481
01:48:32,382 --> 01:48:33,883
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, we will have new songs.

1482
01:48:34,063 --> 01:48:37,744
[SPEAKER_17]: We will have new songs brought to us by DJ Taka, Tak, Ram, and many other familiar names.

1483
01:48:37,784 --> 01:48:47,629
[SPEAKER_17]: Some songs that would definitely catch our heart include Taka with Natural Principle, Aya with Death Wind, Tak with Irrational, Yamato with X-49,

1484
01:48:49,202 --> 01:48:51,585
[SPEAKER_17]: and Akira Yamaoka with Electric Wave.

1485
01:48:51,605 --> 01:48:53,747
[SPEAKER_24]: First of all, I went to Tac's site and Irrational's not on there.

1486
01:48:55,029 --> 01:48:56,951
[SPEAKER_17]: Ah, so maybe... No, it's Tac.

1487
01:48:57,051 --> 01:48:57,731
[SPEAKER_17]: It says Tac here.

1488
01:48:57,792 --> 01:48:58,432
[SPEAKER_17]: Tac with Irrational.

1489
01:48:58,532 --> 01:49:03,898
[SPEAKER_24]: I also scoured several of my downloading places and I haven't found that anywhere.

1490
01:49:04,759 --> 01:49:06,641
[SPEAKER_17]: So, might be a little bit of bullshit, but there you go.

1491
01:49:07,282 --> 01:49:10,005
[SPEAKER_17]: So, what do you guys think about 2DX9's style possibly being the last?

1492
01:49:11,721 --> 01:49:12,481
[SPEAKER_24]: Fuck you, Konami.

1493
01:49:13,141 --> 01:49:14,002
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think they would do that.

1494
01:49:14,022 --> 01:49:15,682
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry, but that series makes way too much money.

1495
01:49:15,842 --> 01:49:17,283
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1496
01:49:17,403 --> 01:49:28,487
[SPEAKER_19]: Even with as rare as some machines are in here in the US, it could make a lot more money here if Konami in Japan paid attention, but I'm sure as popular as it is in Japan, they wouldn't cut it off now.

1497
01:49:28,507 --> 01:49:31,868
[SPEAKER_18]: Just don't let 2DX get in the hands of Konami of America.

1498
01:49:31,888 --> 01:49:32,588
[SPEAKER_18]: Holy crap.

1499
01:49:32,708 --> 01:49:34,309
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh god, that's a scary thought!

1500
01:49:36,769 --> 01:49:40,330
[SPEAKER_24]: Unless they're going to give us 9-key 2DX or something, I don't know.

1501
01:49:40,390 --> 01:49:41,130
[SPEAKER_24]: That'd be weird.

1502
01:49:42,331 --> 01:49:45,012
[SPEAKER_19]: But then it'd be Poppin' DX!

1503
01:49:45,272 --> 01:49:49,713
[SPEAKER_18]: Resurrect, freaking, what was it, Kraken DJ.

1504
01:49:50,773 --> 01:49:52,593
[SPEAKER_17]: Kraken DJ's the shit, I like that game a lot.

1505
01:49:52,914 --> 01:49:56,434
[SPEAKER_17]: Anybody else want to say anything about Night Style, Night Style being the last things they want to see on Night Style?

1506
01:49:57,615 --> 01:49:58,535
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know, more Taka.

1507
01:50:00,035 --> 01:50:01,336
[SPEAKER_17]: If this were the last 2DX...

1508
01:50:03,346 --> 01:50:08,870
[SPEAKER_17]: Say if they do a Beatmania 4, a fourth series or whatever, what do you think they should do in it?

1509
01:50:09,931 --> 01:50:12,373
[SPEAKER_18]: I was actually talking about this earlier today with Zero.

1510
01:50:12,493 --> 01:50:20,019
[SPEAKER_18]: I was saying that they should add, much like Beatmania 3 had the foot pedal effector thing, which didn't do shit, Crossfader.

1511
01:50:20,940 --> 01:50:22,761
[SPEAKER_18]: Like we were talking about, what was it we were talking about?

1512
01:50:23,481 --> 01:50:26,784
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, Healing Vision Angelic, where that one part where it's just all din-din-din-din.

1513
01:50:27,044 --> 01:50:28,785
[SPEAKER_18]: Have that be like a Crossfader part on there.

1514
01:50:29,326 --> 01:50:29,906
[SPEAKER_18]: Something like that.

1515
01:50:29,926 --> 01:50:30,287
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

1516
01:50:30,387 --> 01:50:32,008
[SPEAKER_18]: A little bit more elaborate.

1517
01:50:34,086 --> 01:50:36,607
[SPEAKER_19]: I was thinking also, you know, like in Keyboard Mania, how you have the wheel?

1518
01:50:37,367 --> 01:50:38,327
[SPEAKER_19]: Something like that.

1519
01:50:39,128 --> 01:50:40,248
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1520
01:50:41,128 --> 01:50:42,008
[SPEAKER_17]: Here's my suggestion.

1521
01:50:42,028 --> 01:50:44,129
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the same thing they need to do to DDR.

1522
01:50:44,369 --> 01:50:48,330
[SPEAKER_17]: Like when they bring DDR to a new series, if they're going to do a DDR 2DX or whatever.

1523
01:50:49,831 --> 01:50:55,612
[SPEAKER_17]: They need to do a... Well, Freeze Notes is one thing, because Easy to DJ has that, but it's kind of overrated.

1524
01:50:55,632 --> 01:50:58,953
[SPEAKER_24]: Beatmania, the final, does have the full rotational... They do have that.

1525
01:50:59,073 --> 01:50:59,594
[SPEAKER_17]: It's pretty cool.

1526
01:50:59,754 --> 01:51:00,694
[SPEAKER_17]: They haven't done that in 2DX yet.

1527
01:51:01,904 --> 01:51:05,427
[SPEAKER_17]: I would suggest some kind of more elaborate battle mode.

1528
01:51:05,607 --> 01:51:09,791
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, imagine if they had the thing in Disney's Rave to 2DX.

1529
01:51:10,031 --> 01:51:13,274
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be cool.

1530
01:51:13,314 --> 01:51:14,375
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, exactly.

1531
01:51:16,277 --> 01:51:17,698
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they have all these characters.

1532
01:51:19,212 --> 01:51:21,833
[SPEAKER_24]: That they don't use anymore because they're the total background.

1533
01:51:22,133 --> 01:51:28,454
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the new versions of DDR and 2DX need to have more competitive modes, because DDR's always been a co-op game till now.

1534
01:51:28,474 --> 01:51:30,234
[SPEAKER_24]: They need freakin' Dance Battle again.

1535
01:51:30,334 --> 01:51:32,115
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, if it were... That was the second mix.

1536
01:51:32,175 --> 01:51:38,256
[SPEAKER_17]: Exactly, if it had more, if it elaborated a little more on competition, like, I think it would be a kick-ass game.

1537
01:51:38,296 --> 01:51:42,517
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, actually, what I would like to see again is an actual, another Link version.

1538
01:51:44,552 --> 01:51:46,815
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that would be a really good idea.

1539
01:51:47,336 --> 01:51:50,280
[SPEAKER_19]: So you think maybe it's coincidence they're ending DDR and 2DX at the same time?

1540
01:51:51,862 --> 01:51:52,563
[SPEAKER_17]: To bring them back?

1541
01:51:52,623 --> 01:51:55,607
[SPEAKER_17]: It's this big, substream resurrection?

1542
01:51:55,627 --> 01:51:56,108
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe, I don't know.

1543
01:51:56,509 --> 01:51:58,071
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe, maybe not.

1544
01:51:58,609 --> 01:52:00,309
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what I'd like to see?

1545
01:52:00,349 --> 01:52:05,451
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to see Beat Mania's song selections on DDR.

1546
01:52:05,871 --> 01:52:10,552
[SPEAKER_18]: Just get rid of all that shit that they're ripping from like Dance Mania, like all these speed mixes.

1547
01:52:10,973 --> 01:52:16,174
[SPEAKER_17]: Anything from Wild Side, I say the Dance Mania stuff is the best stuff in DDR.

1548
01:52:16,354 --> 01:52:16,954
[SPEAKER_17]: It always is.

1549
01:52:18,055 --> 01:52:19,635
[SPEAKER_17]: A little, sometimes not.

1550
01:52:21,699 --> 01:52:24,424
[SPEAKER_19]: As in the Queen songs that they horribly rape and destroy.

1551
01:52:24,464 --> 01:52:26,067
[SPEAKER_17]: The most freestyling songs.

1552
01:52:26,288 --> 01:52:28,452
[SPEAKER_17]: Always the most freestyling songs out of anything in DDR.

1553
01:52:29,406 --> 01:52:37,229
[SPEAKER_18]: So you're saying that you would rather take Scenarius Speedy Mix versus The Sound of Goodbye or Never Look Back.

1554
01:52:37,249 --> 01:52:39,449
[SPEAKER_16]: But Sound of Goodbye and Never Look Back are licensed songs as well.

1555
01:52:39,529 --> 01:52:40,250
[SPEAKER_17]: Fly Away.

1556
01:52:40,570 --> 01:52:42,210
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are all licensed songs you're naming.

1557
01:52:42,250 --> 01:52:43,271
[SPEAKER_17]: They're not Konami originals.

1558
01:52:43,291 --> 01:52:44,231
[SPEAKER_17]: They're all licensed songs.

1559
01:52:44,331 --> 01:52:45,011
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, fine.

1560
01:52:45,071 --> 01:52:47,012
[SPEAKER_18]: General Relativity, 19 November.

1561
01:52:47,772 --> 01:52:49,273
[SPEAKER_18]: How about Wow Wow 70s?

1562
01:52:49,293 --> 01:52:52,754
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not saying to get rid of those, but don't get rid of the Dance Meeting stuff because that's some of the best stuff.

1563
01:52:52,774 --> 01:52:53,574
[SPEAKER_18]: What am I talking about?

1564
01:52:53,614 --> 01:52:55,415
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, say just fuck up the steps in the first place.

1565
01:52:55,435 --> 01:52:55,835
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

1566
01:52:58,160 --> 01:53:01,021
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, most of the Dance We Need stuff is fine, but I got one word for you.

1567
01:53:01,381 --> 01:53:01,782
[SPEAKER_13]: Joga.

1568
01:53:03,963 --> 01:53:04,303
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1569
01:53:05,663 --> 01:53:06,644
[SPEAKER_17]: I got one word for you.

1570
01:53:06,924 --> 01:53:08,325
[SPEAKER_17]: I got one word for you, bitch.

1571
01:53:08,485 --> 01:53:09,165
[SPEAKER_17]: Politary.

1572
01:53:09,645 --> 01:53:12,066
[SPEAKER_24]: No, Joga, also known as Ban For More's Lounge.

1573
01:53:12,406 --> 01:53:17,729
[SPEAKER_24]: Because they do nothing but the same damn song every time.

1574
01:53:18,385 --> 01:53:20,327
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh god, Loki just said he wants to make a remix.

1575
01:53:20,387 --> 01:53:21,428
[SPEAKER_24]: Please do a Joker remix.

1576
01:53:21,488 --> 01:53:22,369
[SPEAKER_17]: Please, please, please.

1577
01:53:22,389 --> 01:53:24,551
[SPEAKER_24]: Rob, by the way, I've warned you, that's the trap chair.

1578
01:53:24,591 --> 01:53:24,991
[SPEAKER_24]: Don't fall.

1579
01:53:25,692 --> 01:53:27,013
[SPEAKER_19]: Rob almost fell out of it again.

1580
01:53:27,053 --> 01:53:28,455
[SPEAKER_19]: That's like the second time in five minutes.

1581
01:53:29,721 --> 01:53:36,545
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, one thing I like about Extreme is how you're seeing more music that you wouldn't expect to see on DDR at all.

1582
01:53:36,966 --> 01:53:47,973
[SPEAKER_18]: I would hope to see that, like, even if they did have, like, a next version or whatever, or didn't, I would just hope that they would, like, keep going with the evolution of music that they're finally doing in Extreme.

1583
01:53:48,733 --> 01:53:56,158
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, how they have, like, rock beat music and they actually have real stuff instead of all that same annoying crap that they had from the past.

1584
01:53:56,218 --> 01:54:00,361
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, like, uh, We Are The Champions, because that song's just played so much.

1585
01:54:00,901 --> 01:54:06,405
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I can't tell you how many times I tell people, stop playing We Are The Champions, keep hearing that song over and over.

1586
01:54:09,247 --> 01:54:11,208
[SPEAKER_17]: They took Queen and made it gay.

1587
01:54:11,548 --> 01:54:14,330
[SPEAKER_17]: And for the record, I play that song.

1588
01:54:15,671 --> 01:54:17,012
[SPEAKER_19]: And for the record, Queen was gay.

1589
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:20,100
[SPEAKER_19]: I know that, dammit!

1590
01:54:21,081 --> 01:54:23,101
[SPEAKER_17]: But the music wasn't until that.

1591
01:54:23,121 --> 01:54:25,642
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we just made JB have a cry because it's SyFam.

1592
01:54:25,882 --> 01:54:27,602
[SPEAKER_17]: Ice Queen, by the way, just got a zing with that.

1593
01:54:29,503 --> 01:54:32,423
[SPEAKER_18]: Even still, you know, there's better stuff that's come from SyFam.

1594
01:54:32,664 --> 01:54:34,264
[SPEAKER_18]: Look at freaking DDR USA.

1595
01:54:34,284 --> 01:54:36,064
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, those songs were awesome.

1596
01:54:36,605 --> 01:54:38,585
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, Take It To The Morning Light, you know.

1597
01:54:41,766 --> 01:54:42,166
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah!

1598
01:54:43,362 --> 01:54:46,547
[SPEAKER_18]: Seriously, we are the champions!

1599
01:54:47,008 --> 01:54:48,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, na-na-na-na-na, yeah!

1600
01:54:50,354 --> 01:54:52,497
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkBlackForest, I mean, that was awesome.

1601
01:54:53,018 --> 01:54:54,741
[SPEAKER_19]: Ooh, and Sandstorm!

1602
01:54:56,266 --> 01:54:57,547
[SPEAKER_19]: We can rave!

1603
01:54:58,147 --> 01:54:58,628
[SPEAKER_24]: You know what?

1604
01:54:59,108 --> 01:55:00,909
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we're going to probably have to take a break.

1605
01:55:01,650 --> 01:55:03,331
[SPEAKER_17]: I have one more story that needs to be read.

1606
01:55:03,471 --> 01:55:04,051
[SPEAKER_17]: Needs to be read.

1607
01:55:04,091 --> 01:55:05,852
[SPEAKER_17]: Because actually some people were alluding to this.

1608
01:55:06,133 --> 01:55:07,253
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, what were we saying?

1609
01:55:07,313 --> 01:55:08,274
[SPEAKER_24]: We have to also tally the votes.

1610
01:55:08,294 --> 01:55:08,914
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we have to tally the votes.

1611
01:55:08,934 --> 01:55:09,655
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll do that during the break.

1612
01:55:10,496 --> 01:55:13,037
[SPEAKER_17]: But I have to read this news.

1613
01:55:13,117 --> 01:55:19,922
[SPEAKER_17]: And now, again, as with the last story, as with the last story, take this as a rumor.

1614
01:55:20,522 --> 01:55:21,783
[SPEAKER_17]: Take this as a rumor.

1615
01:55:22,103 --> 01:55:22,363
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay?

1616
01:55:22,484 --> 01:55:25,726
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just a rumor until we know more about it.

1617
01:55:26,746 --> 01:55:31,630
[SPEAKER_17]: Konami of Japan told that they are thinking about introducing Beatmania 2DX to the USA.

1618
01:55:32,631 --> 01:55:38,876
[SPEAKER_17]: After gaining so much popularity by their release of DDR USA Mix, they said they are considering the release of the 2DX series as well.

1619
01:55:38,896 --> 01:55:42,198
[SPEAKER_17]: The Konami of Japan says DDR USA was a big success.

1620
01:55:42,498 --> 01:55:48,283
[SPEAKER_17]: The number of players is still increasing and we also get several emails asking if we are going to release the American version of 2DX.

1621
01:55:49,183 --> 01:55:51,125
[SPEAKER_17]: Konami of America is excited about this as well.

1622
01:55:51,205 --> 01:55:54,868
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the spokesmen said the DJ scene is probably more popular in America than Japan.

1623
01:55:57,329 --> 01:56:07,413
[SPEAKER_17]: I am sure that the game will catch the heart of both real DJs Not yet, Loki And the people who want to be one So, want to be a DJ?

1624
01:56:07,433 --> 01:56:09,894
[SPEAKER_17]: Just start playing 2DX That's exactly what they're saying here

1625
01:56:13,135 --> 01:56:16,778
[SPEAKER_17]: The music is great for audience, too, and I don't see why this can't be a success.

1626
01:56:16,898 --> 01:56:22,321
[SPEAKER_17]: It is rumored that the new machine will be revealed at E3 2003.

1627
01:56:22,982 --> 01:56:24,603
[SPEAKER_17]: Depending on the schedule, it might be postponed to 2004.

1628
01:56:25,824 --> 01:56:26,384
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanna go!

1629
01:56:26,944 --> 01:56:27,885
[SPEAKER_17]: Nope, nope, not done yet.

1630
01:56:28,125 --> 01:56:33,429
[SPEAKER_17]: Unlike DDR, instead of the home controller, the entire machine will be brought in and it will be on free play.

1631
01:56:33,949 --> 01:56:38,015
[SPEAKER_17]: They are also thinking about bringing guest players from Japan to show us how the game is played.

1632
01:56:38,316 --> 01:56:40,358
[SPEAKER_17]: That's where I start to think the story is bullshit.

1633
01:56:40,519 --> 01:56:41,720
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the story is bullshit right there.

1634
01:56:42,021 --> 01:56:44,064
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to see DJ Lee too.

1635
01:56:44,104 --> 01:56:46,768
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, you know, that would be cool and all, but they don't need to do that.

1636
01:56:46,908 --> 01:56:49,491
[SPEAKER_17]: There's very good players here locally that they could get.

1637
01:56:50,132 --> 01:56:52,154
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, when I say locally, I mean California.

1638
01:56:52,594 --> 01:56:54,175
[SPEAKER_18]: They don't acknowledge any of those people.

1639
01:56:54,215 --> 01:56:57,037
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, hello, look at DropTheBombSystemSMF.

1640
01:56:57,137 --> 01:56:58,058
[SPEAKER_18]: Six foot!

1641
01:56:58,278 --> 01:56:59,779
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my god, not six feet!

1642
01:56:59,899 --> 01:57:01,540
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm talking about bringing in the players and stuff.

1643
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:02,661
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what they did last year, D2.

1644
01:57:02,681 --> 01:57:03,722
[SPEAKER_17]: They had all US players.

1645
01:57:04,242 --> 01:57:05,223
[SPEAKER_17]: I know Mel was down there.

1646
01:57:05,323 --> 01:57:10,407
[SPEAKER_19]: It would make sense that they would use local players if they know that there's a local scene.

1647
01:57:10,967 --> 01:57:13,529
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, anyway, let me finish and Loki can give the rest of his comments.

1648
01:57:14,089 --> 01:57:20,173
[SPEAKER_17]: One more exciting news about this is that they will have some songs that's only featured on the USA version of 2DX only.

1649
01:57:20,553 --> 01:57:22,634
[SPEAKER_17]: However, it may not satisfy some expert players.

1650
01:57:22,794 --> 01:57:24,856
[SPEAKER_17]: This is going to be the first release of 2DX in America.

1651
01:57:24,876 --> 01:57:28,218
[SPEAKER_17]: It may be aimed at beginner players so they can get into the game easily.

1652
01:57:28,258 --> 01:57:36,243
[SPEAKER_17]: It's possible that the new features included like the beginner mode in DDR USA, possibly similar to the drill mode that's featured in 2DX 5th, 6th homestyle version.

1653
01:57:36,623 --> 01:57:39,825
[SPEAKER_17]: This might be a good chance for people who live outside of California to try this game out.

1654
01:57:40,986 --> 01:57:41,286
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1655
01:57:41,686 --> 01:57:42,527
[SPEAKER_24]: Have at it, Loki.

1656
01:57:42,667 --> 01:57:49,431
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm actually going to take those to a source and see if I can find any legitimacy, but I doubt that it is.

1657
01:57:50,372 --> 01:57:52,753
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll find out, but just take it with a grain of salt.

1658
01:57:52,773 --> 01:57:53,814
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a new story going around.

1659
01:57:53,834 --> 01:57:54,475
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to report it.

1660
01:57:56,016 --> 01:57:56,316
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1661
01:57:57,276 --> 01:57:57,717
[SPEAKER_18]: The only...

1662
01:57:58,883 --> 01:58:04,586
[SPEAKER_18]: The only way this is going to work is if they actually do a good job on this and pick good music for this.

1663
01:58:05,947 --> 01:58:12,810
[SPEAKER_18]: However, looking at Konami of America's past track record, it's not looking good, folks.

1664
01:58:13,230 --> 01:58:14,571
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not looking good at all.

1665
01:58:15,091 --> 01:58:18,333
[SPEAKER_18]: I think they're going to take 2DX and go, you know what?

1666
01:58:18,773 --> 01:58:26,657
[SPEAKER_18]: I think these players haven't played the Japanese songs, so let's take a bunch of stuff from first style, and then we're going to take a shit on it, and then we're going to add some new songs too.

1667
01:58:27,137 --> 01:58:28,678
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to disagree.

1668
01:58:29,078 --> 01:58:35,421
[SPEAKER_17]: Because if they don't try to do this, we're going to do it on a learning curve.

1669
01:58:35,441 --> 01:58:39,262
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to start easy with DDR USA, and then we're going to go to Canomics, and then we're going to go to Max USA.

1670
01:58:39,302 --> 01:58:43,724
[SPEAKER_17]: Which Max USA, if that had been the first one, we would never have people bitching.

1671
01:58:43,764 --> 01:58:46,245
[SPEAKER_17]: People would have been happy with that, and you know what?

1672
01:58:46,325 --> 01:58:48,246
[SPEAKER_17]: People wouldn't bitch about how Konami messes it up.

1673
01:58:49,449 --> 01:58:50,150
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what, Konami?

1674
01:58:50,170 --> 01:58:56,034
[SPEAKER_17]: What you need to do, even though you want to milk the sales, if you want to keep the fans happy, put it all encompassing into one game.

1675
01:58:56,094 --> 01:58:57,635
[SPEAKER_17]: Something that the beginners can pick up.

1676
01:58:57,755 --> 01:59:01,158
[SPEAKER_17]: Have your beginner mode, but have those and others that will murder us too.

1677
01:59:01,238 --> 01:59:02,839
[SPEAKER_17]: The expert stuff and good songs.

1678
01:59:03,420 --> 01:59:04,300
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, not just Light Seven.

1679
01:59:04,340 --> 01:59:06,942
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm talking like the beginner one, two, where every song is one star.

1680
01:59:07,142 --> 01:59:08,343
[SPEAKER_17]: The Japanese ones have that.

1681
01:59:08,383 --> 01:59:08,924
[SPEAKER_17]: No one complains.

1682
01:59:08,964 --> 01:59:09,484
[SPEAKER_17]: It's pretty nice.

1683
01:59:09,564 --> 01:59:10,525
[SPEAKER_17]: It helps you learn how to play.

1684
01:59:11,165 --> 01:59:11,626
[SPEAKER_17]: Do that.

1685
01:59:11,746 --> 01:59:16,009
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't just, don't give us a game that's only the one, two, and three stars or people are going to bitch.

1686
01:59:16,664 --> 01:59:17,204
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be ugly.

1687
01:59:17,224 --> 01:59:19,586
[SPEAKER_24]: If you want to learn how to play, Light 7, leave it there.

1688
01:59:20,106 --> 01:59:21,887
[SPEAKER_24]: Keep your Light 7, keep your 7 key.

1689
01:59:22,448 --> 01:59:24,509
[SPEAKER_24]: That way you have room for people to get better.

1690
01:59:25,069 --> 01:59:25,790
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's just put it this way.

1691
01:59:25,890 --> 01:59:30,613
[SPEAKER_18]: You put Vincent DeMora's Eternity on there, I don't care what the fuck you do with it, you can put big gay-ass...

1692
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:45,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, this is DJ Spanky, saying everybody should play 2DX USA.

1693
01:59:46,574 --> 01:59:47,895
[SPEAKER_03]: I endorse this fully.

1694
01:59:48,515 --> 01:59:52,980
[SPEAKER_03]: It has such wonderful songs in it, like Justify My Love by Madonna.

1695
01:59:54,632 --> 01:59:59,934
[SPEAKER_24]: So Mr. Spanky, does the nice booming subwoofer make you feel special?

1696
02:00:01,434 --> 02:00:04,715
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what I would suggest you do when 2DX comes to the USA.

1697
02:00:05,135 --> 02:00:08,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Get your subwoofer and mount it really high so it comes up to the bar.

1698
02:00:08,896 --> 02:00:11,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Then when you play, straddle the subwoofer.

1699
02:00:11,177 --> 02:00:15,598
[SPEAKER_03]: It's much funner.

1700
02:00:18,859 --> 02:00:20,019
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll make your balls bounce.

1701
02:00:24,770 --> 02:00:28,132
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, that was a little too much information.

1702
02:00:31,394 --> 02:00:32,274
[SPEAKER_19]: And the room falls silent.

1703
02:00:32,995 --> 02:00:37,077
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that we should go to break while we tally the votes for Cage Match, which actually I've already done.

1704
02:00:37,537 --> 02:00:48,383
[SPEAKER_24]: But we'll go to break, we'll play a few songs, especially one by request, and then we'll announce the winner for the Cage Match, which I tabulated while Noah was looking.

1705
02:00:49,804 --> 02:00:52,806
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyway, yeah, here you go.

1706
02:01:14,122 --> 02:01:14,926
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

1707
02:02:00,306 --> 02:02:01,986
[SPEAKER_12]: If I can't get a D, round down to a D

1708
02:02:47,088 --> 02:02:48,131
Thanks for watching!

1709
02:03:15,677 --> 02:03:16,339
Thanks for watching!

1710
02:05:09,447 --> 02:05:09,509
and

1711
02:06:35,621 --> 02:06:36,244
Thank you for watching!

1712
02:07:50,345 --> 02:07:51,986
Thank you for watching!

1713
02:08:25,013 --> 02:08:27,454
Lyrics, Lyrics, Lyrics, Lyrics

1714
02:09:24,761 --> 02:09:31,627
[SPEAKER_30]: Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.

1715
02:09:32,348 --> 02:09:38,474
[SPEAKER_29]: But hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to, and still the fun is just as great.

1716
02:09:38,794 --> 02:09:40,696
[SPEAKER_29]: It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.

1717
02:09:41,276 --> 02:09:45,661
[SPEAKER_29]: Kick it with me, and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

1718
02:09:46,761 --> 02:09:49,122
[SPEAKER_24]: That's one of some of my regular guests.

1719
02:09:49,862 --> 02:09:53,304
[SPEAKER_17]: Miss Starmelby, who we saw yesterday at Derby Owner's Crack.

1720
02:09:53,604 --> 02:09:54,224
[SPEAKER_17]: That was a lot of fun.

1721
02:09:54,725 --> 02:09:55,345
[SPEAKER_17]: He's good people.

1722
02:09:55,825 --> 02:10:00,647
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, anyway, we're going to go ahead and make the announcement then of... Oh, shit, I actually deleted all their songs.

1723
02:10:00,827 --> 02:10:01,588
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll have to find it again.

1724
02:10:01,968 --> 02:10:03,789
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, we're not even going to play it.

1725
02:10:03,809 --> 02:10:11,492
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, anyway, the winner is, by a pretty big vote, is the Zelda mix.

1726
02:10:11,512 --> 02:10:11,993
[SPEAKER_17]: Goodie, goodie.

1727
02:10:12,053 --> 02:10:13,893
[SPEAKER_17]: Not a damn person voted for Fable.

1728
02:10:13,913 --> 02:10:14,834
[SPEAKER_17]: You people made me cry.

1729
02:10:16,417 --> 02:10:17,418
[SPEAKER_24]: You people made me laugh.

1730
02:10:18,478 --> 02:10:24,101
[SPEAKER_10]: I laughed with Jamie.

1731
02:10:25,041 --> 02:10:26,662
[SPEAKER_17]: God, I thought my cackling was bad.

1732
02:10:26,702 --> 02:10:28,163
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought Ice Queen's cackling was bad.

1733
02:10:28,283 --> 02:10:28,543
[SPEAKER_17]: Jesus.

1734
02:10:30,624 --> 02:10:34,206
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, so what we got to do now though, we're going to set up for a list list.

1735
02:10:34,226 --> 02:10:35,546
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to do a list list tonight, right?

1736
02:10:35,726 --> 02:10:35,966
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1737
02:10:36,166 --> 02:10:37,307
[SPEAKER_17]: And what is the list list topic?

1738
02:10:37,667 --> 02:10:38,848
[SPEAKER_24]: Tonight's list list topic is...

1739
02:10:40,137 --> 02:10:42,339
[SPEAKER_24]: What mocap game do we want to see?

1740
02:10:42,799 --> 02:10:47,984
[SPEAKER_17]: You've had mocap boxing, mocap golf, and now what should the next mocap game be?

1741
02:10:48,605 --> 02:10:50,186
[SPEAKER_17]: What would we want to see here in the studio?

1742
02:10:50,486 --> 02:10:51,487
[SPEAKER_17]: That's tonight's list list.

1743
02:10:52,028 --> 02:10:55,110
[SPEAKER_17]: So can we cue up a quick song to give us time to think?

1744
02:10:55,150 --> 02:10:56,371
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to do a few songs.

1745
02:10:57,072 --> 02:11:03,117
[SPEAKER_17]: Just do like, maybe like, we hate to play so many songs in a row, but we just need the time to think here.

1746
02:11:03,558 --> 02:11:07,081
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're going to do like maybe one or two quick songs, and then we'll be back.

1747
02:11:08,641 --> 02:11:10,582
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, we're going to do just a couple quick songs.

1748
02:11:12,724 --> 02:11:13,704
[SPEAKER_18]: Play the Legend of Trance.

1749
02:11:13,764 --> 02:11:15,505
[SPEAKER_18]: You want to do Legend of Trance?

1750
02:11:15,905 --> 02:11:17,106
[SPEAKER_18]: I got an overwhelming response.

1751
02:11:17,867 --> 02:11:21,249
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so we're going to do Legend of Trance and we'll come back and do mocap.

1752
02:11:23,810 --> 02:11:24,911
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, we're loading it up.

1753
02:11:26,331 --> 02:11:37,160
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so if you haven't downloaded it yet, the secret website so you can get to this is willddrforfood.net slash leechfromloki, and that's the secret page where you can download these songs.

1754
02:11:37,180 --> 02:11:40,022
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, the show never contained hot monkey sex, so now... Now it does.

1755
02:11:40,803 --> 02:11:41,063
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1756
02:11:41,843 --> 02:11:42,084
[SPEAKER_18]: So.

1757
02:11:42,664 --> 02:11:43,064
[SPEAKER_17]: Enjoy.

1758
02:11:43,084 --> 02:11:44,946
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're going to play Legend of Trance?

1759
02:11:45,246 --> 02:11:45,446
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes?

1760
02:11:46,087 --> 02:11:46,907
[SPEAKER_17]: If we can get it?

1761
02:11:46,927 --> 02:11:47,368
[SPEAKER_17]: Do-do-do-do-do!

1762
02:11:48,792 --> 02:12:00,294
[SPEAKER_17]: So, it's with an L. Unfortunately, not everybody in the studio is going to be able to help with listless tonight, but we'll let them break any ties we have, which we usually do to people who... What?

1763
02:12:00,814 --> 02:12:01,434
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not working.

1764
02:12:01,834 --> 02:12:02,154
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1765
02:12:02,174 --> 02:12:02,915
[SPEAKER_17]: What do you mean?

1766
02:12:03,235 --> 02:12:05,915
[SPEAKER_17]: We're having technical difficulties, so we're trying again.

1767
02:12:05,935 --> 02:12:07,775
[SPEAKER_17]: What do you mean it's not reading the CD?

1768
02:12:08,015 --> 02:12:09,896
[SPEAKER_17]: In the meantime... That's the CD.

1769
02:12:15,557 --> 02:12:16,637
[SPEAKER_17]: What else were we talking about during the break?

1770
02:12:21,590 --> 02:12:21,971
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1771
02:12:26,835 --> 02:12:27,515
[SPEAKER_17]: We're looking for that.

1772
02:12:27,555 --> 02:12:27,896
[SPEAKER_17]: There it is.

1773
02:12:27,996 --> 02:12:28,896
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, yay, we got it.

1774
02:12:28,956 --> 02:12:32,079
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're going to play Legend of Trance and prepare our list list and we'll be right back.

1775
02:12:32,900 --> 02:12:34,001
[SPEAKER_17]: You are listening to Orange Launch Radio.

1776
02:15:20,501 --> 02:15:22,402
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, we are back and we're ready.

1777
02:15:22,503 --> 02:15:23,423
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to do the list list.

1778
02:15:23,443 --> 02:15:23,824
[SPEAKER_17]: Here we go.

1779
02:15:24,384 --> 02:15:29,888
[SPEAKER_17]: So, the way this list works, in case you're a new listener to the show, what we're going to do, we're all going to name our top three.

1780
02:15:29,928 --> 02:15:36,433
[SPEAKER_17]: We have six people in studio participating, the three hosts, Intern Zero, Puppy, and DarkTest Studio are all participating tonight.

1781
02:15:36,473 --> 02:15:37,353
[SPEAKER_17]: Top three mo-cap games.

1782
02:15:37,373 --> 02:15:39,695
[SPEAKER_24]: By the way, for the record, mo-cap stands for motion capture.

1783
02:15:40,316 --> 02:15:40,896
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, very good.

1784
02:15:40,916 --> 02:15:43,938
[SPEAKER_17]: And you may have seen games like mo-cap, boxing, golf.

1785
02:15:44,219 --> 02:15:46,040
[SPEAKER_24]: And another one, Tsuguri, which is the sword game.

1786
02:15:46,383 --> 02:15:46,783
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

1787
02:15:47,564 --> 02:15:58,789
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, if you've never, if you've policed 9-1-1's kind of a mocap game, you can kind of count Parapara, whatever, you know, if you've never seen an actual mocap game, those are kind of rough estimates of what it is.

1788
02:15:58,809 --> 02:16:00,430
[SPEAKER_17]: It basically uses a sensor for your movement.

1789
02:16:00,470 --> 02:16:00,971
[SPEAKER_17]: Exactly.

1790
02:16:01,471 --> 02:16:05,873
[SPEAKER_17]: So, and then once we all name our top three, then we're going to do the elimination round, which is always fun.

1791
02:16:05,893 --> 02:16:10,956
[SPEAKER_17]: Each of us gets to take one off the list of somebody else's picks, or your own, if you so choose.

1792
02:16:12,036 --> 02:16:12,937
[SPEAKER_17]: I just kind of verped a little.

1793
02:16:12,977 --> 02:16:13,357
[SPEAKER_17]: That was good.

1794
02:16:13,937 --> 02:16:17,578
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the chat room has the ultimate vote.

1795
02:16:17,598 --> 02:16:18,939
[SPEAKER_17]: They're going to vote on their top three.

1796
02:16:19,379 --> 02:16:23,020
[SPEAKER_17]: And Ice Queen and DDRholic, they're not doing lists, but they'll help us break ties.

1797
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:24,961
[SPEAKER_17]: And Bombay's in the back there too, but he's digging through things.

1798
02:16:26,121 --> 02:16:28,122
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, you look like you were hunched over looking at something.

1799
02:16:29,202 --> 02:16:30,162
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you going to hurl?

1800
02:16:30,202 --> 02:16:30,943
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you need a barf bag?

1801
02:16:31,283 --> 02:16:31,683
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you okay?

1802
02:16:31,983 --> 02:16:33,223
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you need a donkey bag?

1803
02:16:34,064 --> 02:16:34,644
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, here we go.

1804
02:16:35,824 --> 02:16:40,226
[SPEAKER_24]: My first choice for a mocap game is mocap horse racing.

1805
02:16:40,842 --> 02:16:42,363
[SPEAKER_17]: MoCap Horse Racing, yay!

1806
02:16:42,423 --> 02:16:44,764
[SPEAKER_24]: Where you're suspended on a giant saddle and have to spank.

1807
02:16:45,945 --> 02:16:48,527
[SPEAKER_17]: I almost had one like that on my list.

1808
02:16:48,567 --> 02:16:51,108
[SPEAKER_24]: Almost like that horse humping game that Namco put out, but not.

1809
02:16:51,609 --> 02:16:52,529
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, Final Furlong?

1810
02:16:53,350 --> 02:16:53,650
Yeah.

1811
02:16:57,572 --> 02:16:58,132
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be fun.

1812
02:16:59,733 --> 02:17:00,654
[SPEAKER_17]: MoCap Horse Racing.

1813
02:17:00,894 --> 02:17:02,695
[SPEAKER_17]: Would it be complete with initial delight cards?

1814
02:17:03,135 --> 02:17:03,376
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1815
02:17:03,516 --> 02:17:04,036
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, cool.

1816
02:17:04,536 --> 02:17:05,117
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, moving on.

1817
02:17:05,377 --> 02:17:05,857
[SPEAKER_17]: Who's next?

1818
02:17:05,997 --> 02:17:06,217
[SPEAKER_14]: Next...

1819
02:17:08,275 --> 02:17:12,200
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, my first choice is mocap drug dealing.

1820
02:17:12,961 --> 02:17:14,963
[SPEAKER_18]: Mocap drug dealing, how would that work?

1821
02:17:15,304 --> 02:17:16,865
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that like Police 911 in reverse?

1822
02:17:17,206 --> 02:17:17,726
[SPEAKER_21]: Pretty much.

1823
02:17:18,127 --> 02:17:22,392
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, you have a certain time period to get your product out on the street as much as possible.

1824
02:17:23,453 --> 02:17:25,095
[SPEAKER_21]: What exactly is being mocapped?

1825
02:17:26,216 --> 02:17:30,340
[SPEAKER_21]: You run from cops.

1826
02:17:30,360 --> 02:17:32,841
[SPEAKER_21]: You actually gotta hand it to people and stuff.

1827
02:17:33,462 --> 02:17:35,864
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you on a treadmill when you do the running part?

1828
02:17:36,144 --> 02:17:37,725
[SPEAKER_17]: How fast can you whip out a ten?

1829
02:17:39,306 --> 02:17:41,048
[SPEAKER_17]: How fast can you take the money and do the drop and run?

1830
02:17:41,068 --> 02:17:42,089
[SPEAKER_17]: Catch the dime bags.

1831
02:17:46,112 --> 02:17:49,975
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I'm just gonna kind of expand on one of them that I had.

1832
02:17:50,755 --> 02:17:55,519
[SPEAKER_18]: I originally had put down mo-cap dancing, but instead I'm gonna put down mo-cap

1833
02:17:56,218 --> 02:17:56,758
[SPEAKER_18]: Rayvar.

1834
02:17:58,979 --> 02:18:00,980
[SPEAKER_18]: No, that's just Parapara, I thought.

1835
02:18:01,400 --> 02:18:06,843
[SPEAKER_18]: No, see, Parapara is more organized.

1836
02:18:06,963 --> 02:18:13,266
[SPEAKER_18]: MoCap Rayvar is more of like, you're kind of just, yeah, more flailing involved.

1837
02:18:13,926 --> 02:18:20,809
[SPEAKER_18]: You got special bonus rounds where you get to massage people on E. Yeah, like the first thing, right, when you put in your money, it drops out an E pill.

1838
02:18:21,249 --> 02:18:22,930
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to take it and wait five minutes.

1839
02:18:23,771 --> 02:18:24,311
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.

1840
02:18:25,595 --> 02:18:26,737
He'll have little glow sticks on strings.

1841
02:18:27,618 --> 02:18:29,460
[SPEAKER_17]: He'll have little glow sticks on strings.

1842
02:18:30,762 --> 02:18:31,483
[SPEAKER_15]: That's beautiful.

1843
02:18:31,744 --> 02:18:32,024
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1844
02:18:32,064 --> 02:18:33,185
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the lights flicker, too.

1845
02:18:33,206 --> 02:18:34,127
[SPEAKER_17]: MoCap Rayvar.

1846
02:18:35,148 --> 02:18:36,630
[SPEAKER_17]: Moving on to Dark Tetsuya.

1847
02:18:39,094 --> 02:18:40,556
[SPEAKER_17]: MoCap Murder Simulator.

1848
02:18:41,116 --> 02:18:42,078
[SPEAKER_17]: MoCap Murder.

1849
02:18:43,829 --> 02:18:47,271
[SPEAKER_17]: So would it just be just like stabbing people or shooting them?

1850
02:18:47,351 --> 02:18:48,512
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess, yeah.

1851
02:18:50,073 --> 02:18:51,754
[SPEAKER_17]: What kind of people would you be murdering?

1852
02:18:52,715 --> 02:18:54,076
[SPEAKER_13]: Terrorists.

1853
02:18:54,156 --> 02:18:55,157
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, terrorists.

1854
02:18:55,397 --> 02:18:56,538
[SPEAKER_13]: What an American answer.

1855
02:18:56,698 --> 02:18:57,138
[SPEAKER_14]: Go down.

1856
02:18:57,398 --> 02:18:57,698
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1857
02:18:59,179 --> 02:18:59,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Puppy.

1858
02:19:01,781 --> 02:19:03,242
[SPEAKER_19]: Mocap binge drinking.

1859
02:19:04,663 --> 02:19:06,624
[SPEAKER_17]: Mocap?

1860
02:19:07,105 --> 02:19:08,325
[SPEAKER_17]: That's kind of like last night.

1861
02:19:09,086 --> 02:19:10,407
[SPEAKER_17]: Mocap binge drinking.

1862
02:19:10,487 --> 02:19:11,888
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think anyone was binging.

1863
02:19:15,086 --> 02:19:16,067
[SPEAKER_17]: That was great, yeah.

1864
02:19:16,207 --> 02:19:16,427
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway.

1865
02:19:16,687 --> 02:19:17,468
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, mocap binge.

1866
02:19:17,488 --> 02:19:17,988
[SPEAKER_17]: How would that work?

1867
02:19:18,008 --> 02:19:20,010
[SPEAKER_17]: Would you have to, like, would it have, like, a floating keg?

1868
02:19:20,791 --> 02:19:30,399
[SPEAKER_19]: You'd probably have to, like, run... Okay, kind of along those same lines.

1869
02:19:31,159 --> 02:19:34,362
[SPEAKER_17]: My number three choice, I said, is mocap Girls Gone Wild.

1870
02:19:37,785 --> 02:19:45,128
[SPEAKER_17]: or what it does is it motion caps the girls lifting their shirts and showing their hooters to the mocap.

1871
02:19:50,790 --> 02:19:51,751
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I can see it now.

1872
02:19:51,851 --> 02:19:56,813
[SPEAKER_21]: A bunch of little 8-year-old kids lighting up around this machine and seeing this chick just lifting up her shirt.

1873
02:19:59,174 --> 02:20:02,815
[SPEAKER_17]: And mocap girls gone wild would have internet ranking, of course.

1874
02:20:05,316 --> 02:20:07,357
[SPEAKER_17]: Co-sponsored by AreYouHotOrNot.com

1875
02:20:08,061 --> 02:20:09,902
[SPEAKER_17]: Seriously, they've got a site.

1876
02:20:10,102 --> 02:20:11,883
[SPEAKER_18]: It's called RateMyBoobs.com.

1877
02:20:14,565 --> 02:20:18,688
[SPEAKER_17]: And of course, if Girls Gone Wild does well, we get the sequel, Guys Gone Crazy.

1878
02:20:20,909 --> 02:20:31,676
[SPEAKER_19]: You have to have, you have to have, the versions would have to be like the Snoop Dogg, the doggy style one, and then the door room fantasies.

1879
02:20:32,176 --> 02:20:32,817
[SPEAKER_19]: No, we want penis.

1880
02:20:34,458 --> 02:20:36,140
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to see the cock.

[SPEAKER_17]: Whip it out.

1882
02:20:38,702 --> 02:20:39,823
[SPEAKER_17]: How fast can you whip it out?

1883
02:20:40,003 --> 02:20:44,708
[SPEAKER_24]: I want initial pee.

1884
02:20:44,728 --> 02:20:46,269
[SPEAKER_17]: What's the chatroom say about all this crap?

1885
02:20:46,789 --> 02:20:47,070
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.

1886
02:20:47,090 --> 02:20:48,711
[SPEAKER_24]: I haven't been paying attention.

1887
02:20:48,811 --> 02:20:49,712
[SPEAKER_24]: Fucking pump it up.

1888
02:20:51,774 --> 02:20:52,775
[SPEAKER_24]: No mocap, Mardi Gras.

1889
02:20:54,039 --> 02:21:12,732
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, um, so now We just, we are just now checking the chatroom by the way, so we didn't steal any answers, so So now for a, I say we go to mine Alright, your number two My number two, MoCap Kama Sutra MoCap Kama Sutra, oh Once again, eight year old children What would be the last level of MoCap Kama Sutra?

1890
02:21:14,233 --> 02:21:19,797
[SPEAKER_24]: One where you have to, you know, dislocate your hip and your shoulders to get into the position And then hop around like a drunk monkey

1891
02:21:21,717 --> 02:21:23,338
[SPEAKER_21]: As I said before, eight-year-old children.

1892
02:21:24,218 --> 02:21:26,539
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just problems right now.

1893
02:21:26,839 --> 02:21:27,600
[SPEAKER_18]: Next one, I changed.

1894
02:21:27,780 --> 02:21:29,140
[SPEAKER_18]: It'll be MoCap DC Sniper.

1895
02:21:29,741 --> 02:21:31,481
[SPEAKER_17]: MoCap DC Sniper.

1896
02:21:32,482 --> 02:21:33,382
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, that's bad.

1897
02:21:33,922 --> 02:21:37,604
[SPEAKER_17]: How is this... No, see this whole thing, though?

1898
02:21:37,644 --> 02:21:44,947
[SPEAKER_24]: This has, like... No, you'd have, like, the From the Trunk level.

1899
02:21:45,700 --> 02:21:48,881
[SPEAKER_24]: And then you'd have, like, the building level, and you'd have to, like, run up the stairs to get the building.

1900
02:21:49,402 --> 02:21:50,242
[SPEAKER_17]: Bombay was in the back.

1901
02:21:50,282 --> 02:21:54,884
[SPEAKER_17]: He was saying, for those that didn't hear it, the downtown bike puncher mocap game.

1902
02:21:54,924 --> 02:22:01,187
[SPEAKER_17]: Because, I don't know if you guys have heard, but here in Sacramento we have this guy who's famous for riding around on a bike in the middle of the night and punching women in the face.

1903
02:22:02,467 --> 02:22:07,630
[SPEAKER_17]: Which sounds funny, but it's a horrible crime, I mean, but... Just, it's weird.

1904
02:22:07,650 --> 02:22:08,970
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the only way you can describe it.

1905
02:22:09,010 --> 02:22:12,872
[SPEAKER_17]: What kind of guy just goes around and punches people in the... Anyway...

1906
02:22:13,820 --> 02:22:15,380
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think it's a guy, I think I'm doing it.

1907
02:22:15,801 --> 02:22:17,801
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

1908
02:22:18,121 --> 02:22:26,284
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, like, DC Sniper, you would, like, actually have to get in different positions, like the prone position and hiding in bushes and stuff.

1909
02:22:26,824 --> 02:22:30,905
[SPEAKER_21]: And then you'd have to, like, trek your way across the country to try to get away.

1910
02:22:33,206 --> 02:22:34,826
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so, moving on, Loki.

1911
02:22:35,447 --> 02:22:38,587
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, I've been changing mine, like, as I'm thinking here, sitting here.

1912
02:22:38,948 --> 02:22:41,428
[SPEAKER_18]: I was gonna stop with, uh, mocap surgery, but no.

1913
02:22:41,788 --> 02:22:43,129
[SPEAKER_18]: We're not doing mocap surgery.

1914
02:22:43,329 --> 02:22:43,429
[SPEAKER_18]: Um...

1915
02:22:44,722 --> 02:22:46,663
[SPEAKER_18]: Instead, it's going to be mo-cap vandalism.

1916
02:22:46,903 --> 02:22:53,225
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, this could include, like, freaking mailbox baseball, you know, classic, spray painting.

1917
02:22:53,625 --> 02:22:54,065
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude!

1918
02:22:54,585 --> 02:22:54,765
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait.

1919
02:22:55,285 --> 02:22:57,466
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, we're going to limit it now.

1920
02:22:57,806 --> 02:23:00,187
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to be mo-cap graffiti.

1921
02:23:01,067 --> 02:23:02,268
[SPEAKER_18]: Mo-cap graffiti.

1922
02:23:04,888 --> 02:23:06,969
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, like you've got to, like, you know, tag shit.

1923
02:23:07,389 --> 02:23:10,250
[SPEAKER_18]: It's got skill and, you know, it's cool.

1924
02:23:12,802 --> 02:23:13,242
[SPEAKER_17]: Wonderful.

1925
02:23:13,322 --> 02:23:13,643
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1926
02:23:14,163 --> 02:23:14,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, Joe's next.

1927

[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yes.

1928
02:23:18,005 --> 02:23:22,808
[SPEAKER_13]: I think, for this one, I'm pretty sure that Kat and I, Joe, would probably in it.

02:23:30,360 --> 02:23:31,301
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be beautiful.

[SPEAKER_17]: Anita, could you explain this?

1941
02:23:55,821 --> 02:23:56,982
[SPEAKER_17]: How does the donkey punch work?

1942
02:23:57,856 --> 02:24:02,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how come you think I know so much about it?

1943
02:24:02,859 --> 02:24:04,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you brought it up last night.

1944
02:24:05,480 --> 02:24:09,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, everybody knows what donkey punching is.

1945
02:24:09,822 --> 02:24:10,322
[SPEAKER_17]: No, we don't.

1946
02:24:11,303 --> 02:24:12,343

[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes, let Loki do it.

1949
02:24:22,543 --> 02:24:29,244
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, freakin' donkey punching is when you're, like, taking a chick from behind, and then you just, you take your fist and you smack it in the back of her head.

1950
02:24:30,904 --> 02:24:31,604
[SPEAKER_02]: As hard as you can.

1951
02:24:31,644 --> 02:24:32,364
[SPEAKER_02]: As hard as you can.

1952
02:24:32,924 --> 02:24:34,205
[SPEAKER_02]: So that she clenches?

1953
02:24:35,065 --> 02:24:35,345
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1954
02:24:37,905 --> 02:24:41,006
[SPEAKER_22]: So you're fucking somebody else, and then you start slapping him in the back of the head.

1955
02:24:41,766 --> 02:24:42,846
[SPEAKER_02]: It can also be applied to men.

1956
02:24:48,266 --> 02:24:48,566
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1957
02:24:49,306 --> 02:24:49,726

[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, my number two is, uh, MoCap Snow Art, where, uh, it records your movements of, like, like stage one is writing your name in the snow.

02:25:09,386 --> 02:25:12,590
[SPEAKER_17]: and then like, you know, mocap, you know, like just peeing things in the snow.

[SPEAKER_18]: MoCap Mud Wrestling, because how could you really motion capture that, though?

2059
02:31:32,034 --> 02:31:33,635
[SPEAKER_18]: Unless there's two players, you know?

2060
02:31:36,677 --> 02:31:37,818
[SPEAKER_17]: Ice Queen's offering to demonstrate.

2061
02:31:37,978 --> 02:31:39,158
[SPEAKER_13]: I have had a cry.

2062
02:31:39,178 --> 02:31:39,899
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2063
02:31:39,939 --> 02:31:41,059
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, Dark Tetsuya.

2064
02:31:41,920 --> 02:31:43,080
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, no, I'm sorry, Loki's next.

2065
02:31:43,100 --> 02:31:43,641
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, Loki.

2066
02:31:43,661 --> 02:31:45,162
[SPEAKER_17]: Whatever, go ahead.

2067
02:31:45,182 --> 02:31:46,022
[SPEAKER_17]: Dark Tetsuya's going instead.

2068
02:31:46,823 --> 02:31:47,643
[SPEAKER_17]: Binge drinking.

2069
02:31:48,684 --> 02:31:49,664
[SPEAKER_17]: MoCap binge, I agree.

2070
02:31:49,704 --> 02:31:50,945
[SPEAKER_17]: I was going to take that off.

2071
02:31:50,985 --> 02:31:54,547
[SPEAKER_17]: Just because you can't really get liquor from the machine, so it kind of sucks.

2072
02:31:55,379 --> 02:31:57,280
[SPEAKER_19]: We should have done mocap praying.

2073
02:31:57,300 --> 02:31:58,140
[SPEAKER_19]: Mocap for God.

2074
02:31:58,540 --> 02:31:59,301
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh well.

2075
02:32:00,061 --> 02:32:06,704
[SPEAKER_19]: No, it's actually going to be... We're taking off... Drug dealing, because...

2076
02:32:22,655 --> 02:32:28,537
[SPEAKER_18]: It's... It's just like... It's... No, it's... It's kinda... You need something simpler than that.

2077
02:32:28,957 --> 02:32:34,579
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, mocap, uh... Yeah, or something.

2078
02:32:35,379 --> 02:32:35,720
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

2079
02:32:35,840 --> 02:32:36,200
[SPEAKER_14]: Puppy.

2080
02:32:38,200 --> 02:32:38,600
[SPEAKER_14]: Puppy.

2081
02:32:38,861 --> 02:32:40,341
[SPEAKER_19]: Mocap.

2082
02:32:41,682 --> 02:32:48,404
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh... Uh... What?

2083
02:32:50,484 --> 02:32:50,885
[SPEAKER_19]: Shut up.

2084
02:32:50,945 --> 02:32:51,825
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm trying to decide here.

2085
02:32:52,843 --> 02:32:55,125
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh... You gonna fucking cap somebody?

2086
02:32:57,387 --> 02:32:58,788
[SPEAKER_19]: Bust a cap in your ass!

2087
02:32:59,509 --> 02:33:00,590
[SPEAKER_19]: We're almost done, don't worry.

2088
02:33:00,650 --> 02:33:00,810
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

2089
02:33:01,530 --> 02:33:05,293
[SPEAKER_19]: I will get rid of mocap mine, because it'd be all black and white.

2090
02:33:06,034 --> 02:33:06,635
[SPEAKER_19]: And it'd suck.

2091
02:33:07,155 --> 02:33:07,876
[SPEAKER_17]: Aw, alright.

2092
02:33:08,116 --> 02:33:09,337
[SPEAKER_17]: It should've been mocap charades.

2093
02:33:10,498 --> 02:33:12,639
[SPEAKER_17]: This is hard, because I like all of these.

2094
02:33:12,940 --> 02:33:18,084
[SPEAKER_17]: Um... I'm gonna have to take off with a little bit of... I have to take off mocap line dancing.

2095
02:33:18,104 --> 02:33:18,144
[SPEAKER_17]: Aw.

2096
02:33:18,832 --> 02:33:21,373
[SPEAKER_17]: Just because that's kind of what Parapara is.

2097
02:33:21,633 --> 02:33:24,495
[SPEAKER_17]: Parapara is kind of line dancing, so they already have it, as far as I can see.

2098
02:33:24,575 --> 02:33:26,316
[SPEAKER_17]: Otherwise, they're... Anyway, they're...

2099
02:33:43,223 --> 02:33:46,206
[SPEAKER_17]: We're having a little bit of dead air right now.

2100
02:33:48,488 --> 02:33:49,930
[SPEAKER_17]: So what are we going to do?

2101
02:33:49,950 --> 02:33:50,790
[SPEAKER_17]: Are we going to read the list?

2102
02:33:52,732 --> 02:33:53,433
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll read the list.

2103
02:33:53,833 --> 02:34:07,767
[SPEAKER_24]: The first one is MoCap Horse Racing, MoCap Ravar, MoCap Murder, Girls Gone Wild, Kama Sutra, DC Sniper, Graffiti, Snow Art, Tron, Curling, Supermarket Sweep, and Spanking.

2104
02:34:10,098 --> 02:34:10,919
[SPEAKER_03]: and Spanking.

2105
02:34:12,120 --> 02:34:13,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, Spanking.

2106
02:34:15,462 --> 02:34:16,442
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, sorry.

2107
02:34:16,963 --> 02:34:17,723
[SPEAKER_18]: Nobody else took it off.

2108
02:34:18,624 --> 02:34:20,605
[SPEAKER_18]: MoCap UPS delivery driver.

2109
02:34:20,805 --> 02:34:24,148
[SPEAKER_18]: Just like frickin' Ace Ventura, the opening scene there.

2110
02:34:25,288 --> 02:34:26,409
[SPEAKER_18]: Sounds a little broken.

2111
02:34:28,751 --> 02:34:29,771
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what else?

2112
02:34:29,811 --> 02:34:34,454
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just, you know MoCap UPS driver, you just walk up to the door and then like hot women jump on you and try to fuck you.

2113
02:34:35,275 --> 02:34:39,478
[SPEAKER_17]: Because like everybody, like a bunch of women I know get really horny over the UPS driver for whatever reason.

2114
02:34:45,590 --> 02:34:47,392
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the fact that he comes and he goes.

2115
02:34:47,732 --> 02:34:51,755
[SPEAKER_02]: He comes to the place, he brings a package, and he leaves.

2116
02:34:52,696 --> 02:34:53,656
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it is.

2117
02:34:56,358 --> 02:34:57,139
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the track.

2118
02:34:57,439 --> 02:34:58,720
[SPEAKER_13]: People love the track.

2119
02:35:00,822 --> 02:35:02,683
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyway, we're accepting your votes right now.

2120
02:35:02,703 --> 02:35:04,365
[SPEAKER_24]: We're going to go to break while you send in your votes.

2121
02:35:05,125 --> 02:35:07,687
[SPEAKER_24]: And we'll have a response when we come back.

2122
02:35:08,228 --> 02:35:08,488
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

2123
02:35:31,545 --> 02:35:32,186
and many more.

2124
02:36:43,758 --> 02:36:44,544
Thanks for watching!

2125
02:37:53,853 --> 02:37:54,498
Thanks for watching!

2126
02:39:16,076 --> 02:39:18,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes you do, yes you do, you do my faction

2127
02:39:44,026 --> 02:40:08,426
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, try me, take a chance on my passion We'll be together all the time I said, try me, take a chance on emotions From now and ever, into my heart I said, try me, take a chance on my passion We'll be together till the morning light Don't stand so, don't stand so, don't stand so close to me

2128
02:41:14,241 --> 02:41:38,419

2129
02:42:00,738 --> 02:42:02,579
[SPEAKER_24]: Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

2130
02:42:02,739 --> 02:42:05,240
[SPEAKER_28]: Because Bongo demands it.

2131
02:42:07,201 --> 02:42:07,641
[SPEAKER_24]: We're back.

2132
02:42:08,401 --> 02:42:09,642
[SPEAKER_24]: And we have a winner.

2133
02:42:10,182 --> 02:42:10,682
[SPEAKER_24]: A few of them.

2134
02:42:11,613 --> 02:42:18,456
[SPEAKER_24]: Number three for Best MoCap Game is MoCap Snow Art.

2135
02:42:19,676 --> 02:42:25,879
[SPEAKER_24]: Hooray for P. Number two winner is MoCap Rayvar.

2136
02:42:26,779 --> 02:42:27,660
Whee!

2137
02:42:28,780 --> 02:42:33,362
[SPEAKER_24]: And the number one is MoCap Kama Sutra.

2138
02:42:34,522 --> 02:42:36,063
[SPEAKER_24]: Because, dammit, we like the nookie.

2139
02:42:36,883 --> 02:42:37,344
[SPEAKER_17]: Yay!

2140
02:42:39,528 --> 02:42:42,789
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, another fabulous list list comes to a close.

2141
02:42:43,489 --> 02:42:43,769
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

2142
02:42:45,650 --> 02:42:45,990
[SPEAKER_17]: What happened?

2143
02:42:46,010 --> 02:42:47,270
[SPEAKER_24]: I meant to save it and I closed it.

2144
02:42:47,550 --> 02:42:47,830
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh well.

2145
02:42:48,651 --> 02:42:49,111
[SPEAKER_17]: Life goes on.

2146
02:42:49,391 --> 02:42:51,872
[SPEAKER_24]: Somebody in the chat room posted on Yusuf Osaka Forest.

2147
02:42:51,892 --> 02:42:52,172
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2148
02:42:52,192 --> 02:42:52,472
[SPEAKER_24]: The end.

2149
02:42:52,672 --> 02:42:52,912
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

2150
02:42:53,432 --> 02:42:56,173
[SPEAKER_17]: So, now we're going to do, we're going to Ask Orange Lounge.

2151
02:42:56,193 --> 02:42:58,714
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to close out this with a couple quick questions for Ask Orange Lounge.

2152
02:42:58,734 --> 02:43:00,394
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, let's do Ask Orange Lounge.

2153
02:43:00,494 --> 02:43:00,954
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so.

2154
02:43:00,974 --> 02:43:01,635
[SPEAKER_17]: We've got ten minutes.

2155
02:43:01,675 --> 02:43:02,875
[SPEAKER_17]: Send your question over PM.

2156
02:43:03,115 --> 02:43:05,616
[SPEAKER_17]: Send your question over private message to DarkSakura.

2157
02:43:05,636 --> 02:43:07,716
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember, we have a ton of guests in studio tonight.

2158
02:43:07,736 --> 02:43:09,737
[SPEAKER_24]: By the way, by the way, bad grammar.

2159
02:43:09,837 --> 02:43:11,217
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not should of, it's should have.

2160
02:43:12,757 --> 02:43:13,958
[SPEAKER_24]: And you're guilty of that, too.

2161
02:43:14,358 --> 02:43:14,738
[SPEAKER_16]: So what?

2162
02:43:17,639 --> 02:43:19,059
[SPEAKER_24]: You still knew what I was saying.

2163
02:43:19,099 --> 02:43:21,059
[SPEAKER_24]: I went off on that on one of my fuckies of the week.

2164
02:43:21,940 --> 02:43:24,880
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, let's see if we have our first question.

2165
02:43:24,900 --> 02:43:27,601
[SPEAKER_17]: Here's a big ball of Kleenex just for you, dear.

2166
02:43:28,877 --> 02:43:31,818
[SPEAKER_24]: First question comes from ManekiNekoJass.

2167
02:43:32,118 --> 02:43:32,538
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, yay!

2168
02:43:32,938 --> 02:43:33,618
[SPEAKER_24]: Are you gay?

2169
02:43:36,838 --> 02:43:38,759
[SPEAKER_24]: If you scream, you call, you gay.

2170
02:43:39,459 --> 02:43:41,779
[SPEAKER_17]: So wait, are we going to go around and find out who's gay?

2171
02:43:41,859 --> 02:43:43,160
[SPEAKER_17]: Is he directing that one person?

2172
02:43:43,660 --> 02:43:45,260
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a Margaret Cho quote.

2173
02:43:45,700 --> 02:43:47,300
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, it's just a Margaret Cho quote?

2174
02:43:47,400 --> 02:43:48,080
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you gay?

2175
02:43:48,361 --> 02:43:50,521
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, well then, if it's not a real question, forget it.

2176
02:43:50,601 --> 02:43:51,761
[SPEAKER_24]: I have a response to that.

2177
02:43:52,021 --> 02:43:53,181
[SPEAKER_24]: I actually have a response to that.

2178
02:43:55,602 --> 02:43:56,142
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, wait, I'm sorry.

2179
02:43:57,691 --> 02:44:01,132
[SPEAKER_17]: Mommy think everybody little bit gay.

2180
02:44:01,153 --> 02:44:06,595
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a lesbian trapped in a man's body.

2181
02:44:08,315 --> 02:44:09,496
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know, I like boobs sometimes.

2182
02:44:09,516 --> 02:44:10,957
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a lesbian trapped in a man's body.

2183
02:44:12,157 --> 02:44:13,077
[SPEAKER_24]: I like boobs sometimes.

2184
02:44:13,097 --> 02:44:14,438
[SPEAKER_18]: How many times have we heard that one before?

2185
02:44:15,298 --> 02:44:16,799
[SPEAKER_17]: Were you going to play a response to that?

2186
02:44:17,079 --> 02:44:17,899
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I am.

2187
02:44:18,120 --> 02:44:18,920
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, then let's hear it.

2188
02:44:22,902 --> 02:44:25,643
[SPEAKER_02]: I inherited my father's eyes and my mother's...

2189
02:44:29,468 --> 02:44:29,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

2190
02:44:32,869 --> 02:44:33,869
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll eat pussy.

2191
02:44:38,271 --> 02:44:40,231
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not my first choice.

2192
02:44:45,513 --> 02:44:50,235
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll eat pussy if they run out of what I really want.

2193
02:44:52,775 --> 02:44:53,276
[SPEAKER_17]: Interesting.

2194
02:44:53,436 --> 02:44:53,716
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

2195
02:44:55,036 --> 02:44:55,616
[SPEAKER_17]: Moving on.

2196
02:44:56,137 --> 02:44:57,257
[SPEAKER_24]: Next question comes from JB.

2197
02:44:58,101 --> 02:44:59,742
[SPEAKER_24]: When will my SciFam CD get here?

2198
02:44:59,762 --> 02:45:02,124
[SPEAKER_17]: It will get here on next Thursday.

2199
02:45:18,443 --> 02:45:19,424
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, let's see if Rob's right.

2200
02:45:20,245 --> 02:45:22,006
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, our next one comes from Japan Man.

2201
02:45:22,907 --> 02:45:24,148
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyone looking for a good time?

2202
02:45:24,808 --> 02:45:25,048
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2203
02:45:25,309 --> 02:45:25,789
[SPEAKER_24]: Not from you.

2204
02:45:27,050 --> 02:45:28,131
[SPEAKER_24]: That's why we're here.

2205
02:45:28,912 --> 02:45:30,753
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you have a phone number we can call?

2206
02:45:31,153 --> 02:45:31,734
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey, baby.

2207
02:45:32,900 --> 02:45:39,323
[SPEAKER_17]: By the way, just between you and me, that's what I'm aiming for for Season 3, is the debut of the phones.

2208
02:45:40,003 --> 02:45:40,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2209
02:45:41,404 --> 02:45:49,267
[SPEAKER_17]: When Loki and I move, because then we'll be able to dedicate a home line, because, you know, who cares if Orange Lounge people are calling during the middle of the day?

2210
02:45:49,807 --> 02:45:53,148
[SPEAKER_24]: The next question comes from 23rd Magnus, actually for DarkTessia.

2211
02:45:54,769 --> 02:45:59,831
[SPEAKER_24]: I never asked you, if you had to collide Japanese girls in a bucket of chocolate, what would you do?

2212
02:46:02,503 --> 02:46:04,165
[SPEAKER_13]: Our next question comes from Chubbs.

2213
02:46:04,185 --> 02:46:08,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Will you be hosting Orange Dome's radio during March Madness and can I be a guest?

2214
02:46:17,603 --> 02:46:18,203
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes and yes.

2215
02:46:19,024 --> 02:46:19,985
[SPEAKER_24]: When's your next drunk show?

2216
02:46:20,765 --> 02:46:22,106
[SPEAKER_24]: When we have a three-day weekend.

2217
02:46:22,566 --> 02:46:23,947
[SPEAKER_17]: Probably the Saturday night.

2218
02:46:24,007 --> 02:46:24,247
[SPEAKER_24]: I got it.

2219
02:46:24,367 --> 02:46:24,828
[SPEAKER_24]: I got it.

2220
02:46:25,028 --> 02:46:26,729
[SPEAKER_24]: Sunday night after March Madness.

2221
02:46:26,829 --> 02:46:28,310
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, that's right, because you and me have Monday off.

2222
02:46:28,330 --> 02:46:29,231
[SPEAKER_17]: We should do a fuck-up drunk.

2223
02:46:29,831 --> 02:46:30,151
[SPEAKER_17]: You and me.

2224
02:46:30,251 --> 02:46:31,772
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, the thing is, okay, this is the interesting thing.

2225
02:46:32,132 --> 02:46:35,855
[SPEAKER_17]: In two weeks, Orange Lounge will be preempted by the live running.

2226
02:46:36,515 --> 02:46:37,336
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for watching!

2227
02:46:54,551 --> 02:46:58,174
[SPEAKER_17]: If you want to get in on this, listen to our live tournament coverage.

2228
02:46:58,194 --> 02:47:04,458
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to go all day long, and it's just for you guys who are far away, because we figure most people from California are going to be here at the tournament.

2229
02:47:04,478 --> 02:47:05,278
[SPEAKER_17]: You'll get to hear everybody.

2230
02:47:05,839 --> 02:47:09,641
[SPEAKER_24]: And our next drunk show is probably going to be right after that, because we're going to be like, fuck this, and get drunk.

2231
02:47:09,901 --> 02:47:14,905
[SPEAKER_17]: We will probably do a live fuck-off show immediately following the March Madness coverage.

2232
02:47:15,005 --> 02:47:17,206
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, our next question comes from SkylineDC505.

2233
02:47:17,626 --> 02:47:20,849
[SPEAKER_24]: It says, will I pass my drive test this Thursday?

2234
02:47:21,729 --> 02:47:22,350
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure.

2235
02:47:22,690 --> 02:47:24,311
[SPEAKER_17]: You will pass it with an 80 like I did.

2236
02:47:25,391 --> 02:47:29,832
[SPEAKER_24]: AOSFE, what type of questions can I ask people to make them think I'm interested?

2237
02:47:30,472 --> 02:47:31,172
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, what was it?

2238
02:47:31,813 --> 02:47:34,453
[SPEAKER_24]: What type of questions can I ask people to make them think I'm interested?

2239
02:47:35,993 --> 02:47:37,534
[SPEAKER_24]: What color panties are you wearing?

2240
02:47:39,334 --> 02:47:40,574
[SPEAKER_17]: I like peanut butter, what the fuck?

2241
02:47:41,595 --> 02:47:43,135
[SPEAKER_17]: There you go, that's a great question.

2242
02:47:43,475 --> 02:47:44,215
[SPEAKER_17]: More than Jake.

2243
02:47:45,015 --> 02:47:47,776
[SPEAKER_17]: I like peanut butter, do you want to fuck?

2244
02:47:48,736 --> 02:47:51,517
[SPEAKER_24]: More than Jake asks, why won't anybody pick up the phone?

2245
02:47:51,557 --> 02:47:52,257
[SPEAKER_24]: Because we're not there.

2246
02:47:55,535 --> 02:47:56,215
[SPEAKER_17]: Send an email.

2247
02:47:56,255 --> 02:47:57,175
[SPEAKER_17]: Welcome to the new millennium.

2248
02:47:57,215 --> 02:47:57,376
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi.

2249
02:47:57,636 --> 02:47:58,116
[SPEAKER_24]: 23rd Magus.

2250
02:47:58,956 --> 02:48:00,316
[SPEAKER_24]: Have any of you actually called 867-5309?

2251
02:48:00,917 --> 02:48:03,397
[SPEAKER_24]: No, I never have.

2252
02:48:03,477 --> 02:48:04,177
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody in their lives.

2253
02:48:04,197 --> 02:48:04,958
[SPEAKER_17]: But I have called.

2254
02:48:05,198 --> 02:48:08,939
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, for those of you local in Sacramento in the 916 area code, I have called 332-2222.

2255
02:48:08,979 --> 02:48:12,440
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all I'm going to say.

2256
02:48:13,620 --> 02:48:19,502
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I'll have you know that actually because of that song right there, that's why in every single movie all the phone numbers are 555.

2257
02:48:21,727 --> 02:48:21,988
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2258
02:48:23,069 --> 02:48:37,527
[SPEAKER_18]: Because 555, no one can have a number with that on it because those are dedicated straight for like the movies and stuff because people like that call that number and then some guy just got, I mean, totally pissed off at that, you know?

2259
02:48:37,587 --> 02:48:39,349
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I mean, really, don't you guys watch Pop-Up Video?

2260
02:48:39,509 --> 02:48:40,631
[SPEAKER_21]: They said it like 80 times now.

2261
02:48:41,645 --> 02:48:49,116
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, I believe if any of you saw the movie Punch Drunk Love, there's a scene where Adam Sandler's calling a porn sex line or something and they use a real number.

2262
02:48:49,397 --> 02:48:54,624
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, what they did is that Hollywood bought that 800 number and then put an advertisement for the movie on it.

2263
02:48:55,565 --> 02:48:56,106
[SPEAKER_17]: That's kind of funny.

2264
02:48:57,108 --> 02:48:59,791
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, JBS, can I talk on the air during March Madness?

2265
02:48:59,831 --> 02:49:01,993
[SPEAKER_24]: I will hypnotize you all with sci-fi and talk mohahaha.

2266
02:49:02,073 --> 02:49:05,237
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, any- Okay, this is the interesting thing.

2267
02:49:05,257 --> 02:49:13,287
[SPEAKER_17]: If March Madness gets set up like we hope it does, we're not gonna be, like, tucked away in the corner, like, way in the back where you won't be able to see us.

2268
02:49:13,943 --> 02:49:21,665
[SPEAKER_17]: We are hoping that we're going to have, if the tourney is outdoors, like we're thinking it's going to be, provided it's not raining, we're hoping that the gazebo is going to be Orange Lounge.

2269
02:49:21,925 --> 02:49:24,646
[SPEAKER_17]: And if any of you have been to Scandia and see the gazebo out back, it's huge.

2270
02:49:24,666 --> 02:49:25,506
[SPEAKER_17]: You won't miss us.

2271
02:49:25,686 --> 02:49:26,506
[SPEAKER_17]: So come on by.

2272
02:49:26,566 --> 02:49:28,547
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to be open door all day.

2273
02:49:28,627 --> 02:49:30,507
[SPEAKER_17]: So nobody else needs to ask that.

2274
02:49:30,567 --> 02:49:31,608
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, you can be on the show.

2275
02:49:31,708 --> 02:49:32,668
[SPEAKER_17]: Just come on by and say hi.

2276
02:49:32,848 --> 02:49:35,409
[SPEAKER_24]: Will you guys be here in the summer for CBN too?

2277
02:49:35,489 --> 02:49:36,669
[SPEAKER_24]: So can I be a guest that's from Rice?

2278
02:49:38,773 --> 02:49:46,640
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, give me some dates, as long as it's, I can afford it, I don't see why not, yeah, I've, I've not heard anything about CBM2.

2279
02:49:48,522 --> 02:49:55,809
[SPEAKER_19]: Cause there, we already know there's gonna be B3, uh, May 17th and 18th, and definitely gonna be there, so, you should be there too!

2280
02:49:57,125 --> 02:49:58,386
[SPEAKER_17]: May is a little before summer though.

2281
02:49:58,406 --> 02:50:04,294
[SPEAKER_17]: I imagine CyberBeat, they wouldn't want to do that more than twice a year, if even that.

2282
02:50:04,394 --> 02:50:08,760
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would think that January, probably July would be the earliest they'd want to do that.

2283
02:50:08,840 --> 02:50:10,622
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I don't know.

2284
02:50:11,163 --> 02:50:12,265
[SPEAKER_17]: Give us dates, we'll see.

2285
02:50:13,346 --> 02:50:20,032
[SPEAKER_24]: And another one from Jas, what are each of our favorite extreme songs first?

2286
02:50:20,933 --> 02:50:26,878
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't really play extreme that much, because I would normally name anything that Tack does.

2287
02:50:28,139 --> 02:50:30,221
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm actually going to go with Guacamole Del Taco.

2288
02:50:33,684 --> 02:50:40,150
[SPEAKER_18]: Contrary to what a lot of people see me play, I actually seem to like B-11 a lot more than I put on.

2289
02:50:43,740 --> 02:50:48,884
[SPEAKER_18]: I always play A on doubles only because the steps are fun.

2290
02:50:49,144 --> 02:50:51,666
[SPEAKER_18]: And people like watching you run around the pad really fast.

2291
02:50:52,226 --> 02:50:55,188
[SPEAKER_18]: They're like, ooh, arrows going up the screen.

2292
02:50:56,129 --> 02:50:56,609
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, so.

2293
02:51:03,013 --> 02:51:04,695
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so who wants to make a comment?

2294
02:51:04,715 --> 02:51:04,995
[SPEAKER_18]: Come on.

2295
02:51:05,015 --> 02:51:05,695
[SPEAKER_18]: I will.

2296
02:51:06,976 --> 02:51:08,397
[SPEAKER_13]: V, definitely.

2297
02:51:08,417 --> 02:51:09,418
[SPEAKER_13]: V or Butterfly.

2298
02:51:09,918 --> 02:51:10,599
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, that's on Extreme.

2299
02:51:10,639 --> 02:51:10,939
[SPEAKER_13]: Right on.

2300
02:51:14,209 --> 02:51:15,650
[SPEAKER_20]: Le Copa De La Vida.

2301
02:51:16,411 --> 02:51:16,791
[SPEAKER_20]: Amen.

2302
02:51:18,332 --> 02:51:19,333
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay, don't laugh.

2303
02:51:19,473 --> 02:51:20,353
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay, don't laugh.

2304
02:51:20,433 --> 02:51:20,734
[SPEAKER_33]: All right.

2305
02:51:21,334 --> 02:51:24,256
[SPEAKER_33]: Jeanne, Jeanne, Doubles Heavy.

2306
02:51:24,817 --> 02:51:25,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

2307
02:51:25,737 --> 02:51:26,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's cool.

2308
02:51:27,078 --> 02:51:27,979
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fly.

2309
02:51:30,681 --> 02:51:31,041
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see.

2310
02:51:31,821 --> 02:51:36,124
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm stuck between Mobile Logan, Golden Decouple.

2311
02:51:36,965 --> 02:51:37,305
[SPEAKER_19]: Ice Queen?

2312
02:51:38,306 --> 02:51:38,987
[SPEAKER_19]: Favorite extreme song?

2313
02:51:40,501 --> 02:51:41,802
[SPEAKER_22]: Rhythm of Police on Devil's Heavy.

2314
02:51:43,744 --> 02:51:44,684
[SPEAKER_17]: You big stud.

2315
02:51:46,326 --> 02:51:49,648
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to call me fag, but I do, I do, I do.

2316
02:51:49,768 --> 02:51:50,269
[SPEAKER_17]: I love that song.

2317
02:51:50,749 --> 02:51:51,029
[SPEAKER_24]: Fag.

2318
02:51:53,031 --> 02:51:54,492
[SPEAKER_24]: He said so.

2319
02:51:55,253 --> 02:51:59,236
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, and Rob, can he sit at your house with your mic?

2320
02:52:00,597 --> 02:52:01,458
[SPEAKER_17]: I think so, yeah.

2321
02:52:01,538 --> 02:52:05,561
[SPEAKER_17]: I still haven't run that by Brian for sure, but I have told him there is a tournament and people will probably be here.

2322
02:52:05,881 --> 02:52:07,502
[SPEAKER_17]: I just, yeah, I'm pretty sure.

2323
02:52:07,522 --> 02:52:08,303
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's just say yes.

2324
02:52:08,343 --> 02:52:09,504
[SPEAKER_17]: If there's a change to that, I'll let you know.

2325
02:52:10,622 --> 02:52:11,863
[SPEAKER_17]: He's pretty cool with stuff like that.

2326
02:52:11,883 --> 02:52:13,685
[SPEAKER_24]: JB wants to know if I can legally become his cousin.

2327
02:52:15,386 --> 02:52:15,906
[SPEAKER_24]: We could try.

2328
02:52:15,926 --> 02:52:19,209
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm adopting you anyway, so... Interesting.

2329
02:52:19,289 --> 02:52:20,049
[SPEAKER_17]: How would that work?

2330
02:52:22,311 --> 02:52:23,572
[SPEAKER_24]: Your aunt would have to adopt me.

2331
02:52:24,873 --> 02:52:26,554
[SPEAKER_17]: What about, could your aunt adopt him?

2332
02:52:26,715 --> 02:52:27,215
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you have an aunt?

2333
02:52:28,956 --> 02:52:32,359
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a bunch of aunts, but... You don't want them to adopt JB?

2334
02:52:32,399 --> 02:52:34,961
[SPEAKER_24]: You'd rather be adopted by JB's... I'm scared of my family, so...

2335
02:52:37,927 --> 02:52:39,127
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so you'll try.

2336
02:52:40,088 --> 02:52:42,268
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe you can go on the people's court and make that happen.

2337
02:52:42,788 --> 02:52:45,169
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's go on people's court and have them legally make us cousins.

2338
02:52:47,990 --> 02:52:48,750
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the plaintiff.

2339
02:52:50,150 --> 02:52:53,671
[SPEAKER_24]: And then, can I kill ATT, Comcast?

2340
02:52:53,992 --> 02:52:57,112
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, ATT can go, but Comcast is actually doing good service for me.

2341
02:52:58,673 --> 02:52:59,953
[SPEAKER_24]: You can come over here and use my cable.

2342
02:53:02,014 --> 02:53:05,015
[SPEAKER_24]: Can I put a big sign on the gazebo that says Orange Lounge Temple of Butt?

2343
02:53:05,635 --> 02:53:05,835
[SPEAKER_24]: No.

2344
02:53:06,593 --> 02:53:09,214
[SPEAKER_17]: No, because it's Scandia Family Fun Center.

2345
02:53:09,994 --> 02:53:12,756
[SPEAKER_24]: If we shake hands at March Madness, does that make one of us outface?

2346
02:53:13,596 --> 02:53:14,436
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's the DT.

2347
02:53:17,097 --> 02:53:17,517
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, no.

2348
02:53:18,858 --> 02:53:19,558
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, sure.

2349
02:53:20,959 --> 02:53:21,699
[SPEAKER_24]: Ask us more questions.

2350
02:53:21,739 --> 02:53:22,479
[SPEAKER_24]: We have one more minute.

2351
02:53:23,720 --> 02:53:25,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Wasting time, wasting time, wasting time.

2352
02:53:25,601 --> 02:53:28,882
[SPEAKER_16]: Does anybody in the room have a question for anyone else that they want to ask live on air?

2353
02:53:32,503 --> 02:53:36,624
