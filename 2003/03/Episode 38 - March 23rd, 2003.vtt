00:31.340 --> 00:34.940

00:35.940 --> 00:37.220
Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

00:37.220 --> 00:38.220
In this episode...

00:38.220 --> 00:39.220
Hey, are there any balls down there?

00:39.220 --> 00:40.220
That's the biggest bear you've ever seen, Jingle Bear.

00:40.220 --> 00:41.220
What's your favorite scary movie?

00:41.220 --> 00:42.220
Showgirls.

00:42.220 --> 00:43.220
Absolutely frightening.

00:43.220 --> 00:44.220
What's yours?

00:44.220 --> 00:56.140
There are no stupid questions.

00:56.140 --> 00:57.140
Just stupid people.

00:57.140 --> 00:59.640
Torture yourself? That's my job.

00:59.640 --> 01:01.640

01:07.640 --> 01:10.140
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

01:10.140 --> 01:12.640
Why did they have to take the word gang?

01:13.640 --> 01:17.640
No! What I expect for punishing physicians is kendo.

01:17.640 --> 01:20.640
Hey!

01:20.640 --> 01:21.640

01:28.640 --> 01:29.140
Lowkey.

01:29.140 --> 01:32.140
I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex with me.

03:46.980 --> 03:47.980
If they get here.

03:47.980 --> 03:51.700
Hopefully they didn't get lost. You did draw them a good map, right?

03:51.700 --> 03:54.980
Of course. I gave written directions and then I drew a map that showed which house you chose.

03:54.980 --> 03:57.580

09:22.680 --> 09:27.000
And I could be in the dark alone

10:07.660 --> 10:11.660
Everybody's all hyper.

10:11.660 --> 10:15.660
Everybody's all hyper about the Oscars.

10:15.660 --> 10:19.660
Yeah cause Spirited Away fucking won. That's all that matters.

10:19.660 --> 10:23.660
I have to make a new ad.

10:23.660 --> 10:24.660
What are they called again?

10:24.660 --> 10:25.660
They came up with the best name.

10:25.660 --> 10:26.660
Shingles.

10:26.660 --> 10:27.660
Yes.

10:27.660 --> 10:28.660
The Pringles.

10:28.660 --> 10:29.660
That tastes like shit.

10:29.660 --> 10:30.660
Like Skattles?

10:30.660 --> 10:32.660
Everybody go to this address.

10:32.660 --> 10:36.660
Rob, type it up.

10:36.660 --> 10:41.660
www.sackofaimani.com slash Skattles.

10:41.660 --> 10:42.660
No, I take that back.

10:42.660 --> 10:43.660
They're not there.

10:43.660 --> 10:44.660
Go back.

10:44.660 --> 10:45.660
Go back.

10:45.660 --> 10:48.660
It's not www anything.

10:48.660 --> 11:01.260
members.al.com slash dark Sakura slash scattles dot jpg I think that's it

11:01.420 --> 11:05.820
that's what I do when I'm bored is I take products and then make like foul

11:05.820 --> 11:13.300
approximates of them it's either dot jpg or dot gif I don't know that's what I do

11:13.300 --> 11:21.380
do when I get bored, I find meat products. It is.jpg. No, not meat. I find products

11:21.380 --> 11:26.300
and then I make them a little bit different. You should have made them all brown though,

11:26.300 --> 11:31.900
instead of like, what? I'm being summoned. They're meant. They're supposed to give your

11:31.900 --> 11:40.720
ass a minty fresh taste. Yes. Question from the chat room. Did the Disney version of Spirited

11:40.720 --> 11:44.920
away win or did the original Japanese one well it would be the Disney one but

11:44.920 --> 11:49.280
that's because well I don't really know why that is I think that's just because

11:49.280 --> 11:54.040
it's a to the Oscars it's the same movie just a different language track but it's

11:54.040 --> 12:00.320
still the same visual I don't know but yeah the Disney one won anyway wow what

12:00.320 --> 12:05.120
a busy busy week I'm so exhausted after this and I was impressed she pronounced

12:05.120 --> 12:08.760
his name right she probably had a lot of training Cameron Diaz probably had to be

12:08.760 --> 12:15.760
coach

12:16.320 --> 12:20.800
cool can i just get somebody had

12:20.800 --> 12:23.600
anyway

12:23.600 --> 12:27.360
for her to give me a little bit

12:27.360 --> 12:28.520
anyway

12:28.520 --> 12:29.520
uh...

12:29.520 --> 12:32.280
kind of a crazy weekend just to think that next week's even gonna be crazy

12:32.280 --> 12:34.400
reason march madness is coming up

12:34.400 --> 12:36.720
at the end of the week he the second

12:36.720 --> 12:38.360
tournament i've done

12:38.360 --> 12:40.360
that's been around times of unemployment for me.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.360
Give me a job!

12:44.360 --> 12:45.360
That lion is demonic.

12:45.360 --> 12:46.360
That lion is demonic.

12:46.360 --> 12:47.360
Um...

12:47.360 --> 12:49.360
Yes, we have March Madness coming up,

12:49.360 --> 12:53.360
which, by the way, means there will be no live show next Sunday, because...

12:53.360 --> 12:56.360
We'll be live all day Saturday and Sunday.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.360
I'll be all over the freakin' place.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.360
Oh my God.

12:58.360 --> 13:02.360
It's gonna be like, like Shaft was, except I get to do it for two days.

13:02.360 --> 13:07.360
And Loki, once again, gets to, uh, head up taking the reins all by himself.

13:07.360 --> 13:10.360
Hey, what are you guys doing?

13:10.360 --> 13:13.360
I will be helping you 90% of the time.

13:13.360 --> 13:16.360
But I have to emcee the 2DX tournament.

13:16.360 --> 13:19.360
And then I'm going to be participating in one event, but I can't say what.

13:19.360 --> 13:21.360
I'm doing everything else.

13:21.360 --> 13:23.360
Well, at least on the admin side.

13:23.360 --> 13:24.360
Yes.

13:24.360 --> 13:25.360
But you'll be by to say hello, right?

13:25.360 --> 13:30.360
Getting volunteers, offering them potato chips and not paying anybody.

13:30.360 --> 13:32.360
You'll say hi on the show, right?

13:32.360 --> 13:33.360
Of course.

13:33.360 --> 13:43.640
I think it'll be like this what's gonna be really cool about March Madness is

13:43.640 --> 13:46.520
that the machines gonna be set up outside from what I understand but

13:46.520 --> 13:48.960
they're gonna don't worry for those of you they're worried about glare don't

13:48.960 --> 13:52.200
worry about it staffs already thought about it they're gonna just kind of set

13:52.200 --> 13:54.680
it up in like this tent thing with a lot of tarp and they're gonna set it

13:54.680 --> 13:58.520
perpendicular to Sun they have this all worked out so don't worry you won't be

13:58.520 --> 14:02.800
able to get any glare on that so but what's cool about that this is the

14:02.800 --> 14:06.680
machines outside, we're gonna be, for any of those that have ever been to Scandia before,

14:06.680 --> 14:11.320
we're gonna be out in the gazebo. So, you can't miss us. They can't, this is what's

14:11.320 --> 14:14.920
cool about Scandia and letting us do that tournament there. They cancelled all the parties

14:14.920 --> 14:18.280
so we could have the party room and the gazebo, and Orange Lounge gets the gazebos, that's

14:18.280 --> 14:25.200
pretty cool. Word children, screw your birthday, we're having a DDR tournament. Word of advice,

14:25.200 --> 14:28.320
word of advice, if you're coming down to the tournament at Sacramento Scandia, and we hope

14:28.320 --> 14:33.520
come early because it's gonna fill up fast like the parking lot I'm talking

14:33.520 --> 14:36.320
about because there's a lot of people expected to show up next Saturday

14:36.320 --> 14:40.960
between the normal patrons and the DDR tournament so come early to be sure that

14:40.960 --> 14:51.120
you can actually like park nearby what are you mewing about how was your week

14:51.120 --> 14:54.120
What did you do this week, Timmy?

14:54.120 --> 14:56.640
Screwed cats, what?

14:56.640 --> 14:59.000
I didn't do shit.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
What's that, Timmy? Timmy's caught in a whale?

15:08.280 --> 15:12.840
What's that, Timmy?

15:12.840 --> 15:15.800
Fuck it, I fucked it up!

15:15.800 --> 15:19.200
What's that, Timmy's caught in your ass, what?

15:19.200 --> 15:20.420
Gotcha.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.100
Do anything fun this week, Jamie?

15:22.100 --> 15:24.020
Went to a party, watched Battle Royale.

15:24.020 --> 15:28.180
Yes, last night was the big party at Zero's house, and we watched Battle Royale.

15:28.180 --> 15:29.340
You know, I still miss the beginning.

15:29.340 --> 15:31.940
Every time I start to watch that movie, I either catch it in parts

15:31.940 --> 15:34.180
because I have to go to the bathroom and do the whole thing,

15:34.180 --> 15:37.860
or I miss the very beginning, and I miss the beginning again.

15:37.860 --> 15:42.140
Was that a special edition or just the normal?

15:42.140 --> 15:44.820
Because I need a special edition now because there's like a bunch of scenes

15:44.820 --> 15:45.620
that they cut out.

15:45.620 --> 15:48.660
Was this the song from the credits, this song that you had very first

15:48.660 --> 15:53.460
pre-show night because somebody recognized it somebody in the chatroom

15:53.460 --> 15:56.660
recognized it when it first played

15:59.420 --> 16:08.020
very cool I had never I didn't even know what to expect when I saw that movie I

16:08.020 --> 16:10.700
was just kind of sitting about it we didn't know I didn't even know anything

16:10.700 --> 16:13.380
about it I didn't even drink last night so I was actually perfectly sober

16:13.380 --> 16:16.100
watching the movie which you know at a party is actually pretty rarity for me

16:16.100 --> 16:20.100
But I'm just kind of sitting there going, I don't know, everybody was arguing about what movie you want to watch.

16:20.100 --> 16:23.100
Some people want to watch Battle Royale, some people want to watch, what was it called, The Swimmers?

16:23.100 --> 16:24.100
The Water Boys.

16:24.100 --> 16:30.100
Which I thought somebody said The Water Boy, and I'm like, I don't need to see a bad Adam Sandler movie again.

16:30.100 --> 16:36.100
If you want to know more about Battle Royale, now the site does have a good bit of spoilers, but it's a very in-depth site, one of the best I found.

16:36.100 --> 16:46.340
I found, go to battleroyalonline.com and it's actually R-O-Y-A-L-E.

16:46.340 --> 16:47.340
You know what?

16:47.340 --> 16:53.100
I was curious because in the background, you know, when training video, how they had www.br.com.

16:53.100 --> 16:54.100
I'm wondering if that's...

16:54.100 --> 16:55.100
I went to that site.

16:55.100 --> 16:56.100
It wasn't there.

16:56.100 --> 16:57.100
How about br.co.jp?

16:57.100 --> 16:58.100
I didn't try that.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.100
Try br.co.jp.

16:59.100 --> 17:00.100
Oh, br.co.jp.

17:00.100 --> 17:01.100
Uh-huh.

17:01.100 --> 17:02.100
Because there was not a br.com.

17:02.100 --> 17:03.100
I looked.

17:03.100 --> 17:04.100
I looked.

17:04.100 --> 17:05.100
Probably not.

17:05.100 --> 17:06.100
No.

17:06.100 --> 17:07.100
But, um, nope.

17:07.100 --> 17:08.100
But, um, try that site, battleroyalonline.com.

17:08.100 --> 17:09.100
Okay.

17:09.100 --> 17:10.100
Explain the premise of Battle Royale, because we're talking about this movie.

17:10.100 --> 17:11.100
We haven't talked about what it's about, for those that don't know.

17:11.100 --> 17:26.180
In the future, children do not respect their elders, and the world is thrown into chaos.

17:26.180 --> 17:31.820
So they enact this thing called the Battle Royale Act, where they take a randomly-pooled

17:31.820 --> 17:39.060
class of students, and put them in Iraq, and put them on a deserted island, and have them

17:39.060 --> 17:43.260
kill each other until there's one left. And they have these little collars that make their

17:43.260 --> 17:47.820
necks explode in cool, bloody ways. That was cool, but I liked that guy. It was a really

17:47.820 --> 17:54.700
violent movie. Like, if you like young children and violence... I liked the guy that joined

17:54.700 --> 17:59.380
up for fun. That guy kicked ass. Oh my God. Yeah, I liked the fact that... Right, Mexico

17:59.380 --> 18:04.300
was the best one. I liked how the guy taught there in 8th grade. The slut was the coolest

18:04.300 --> 18:09.940
person. I nominate for best student on the island for the males is going to go to the

18:09.940 --> 18:14.100
guy that joined them for fun and then of course you know best female would be the slut, yeah.

18:14.100 --> 18:18.740
I was going to say something profound about the movie I forgot. She got six kills. That

18:18.740 --> 18:25.540
site that I just told you about, it has character profiles for like six of them and it actually

18:25.540 --> 18:29.800
She has the cool slut girls profile, including her family history and everything.

18:29.800 --> 18:39.800
She was a prostitute, and she was pimping out other girls, and she got six kills in

18:39.800 --> 18:40.800
the movie.

18:40.800 --> 18:44.320
It has her body, and actually this site is really cool because it has pictures of all

18:44.320 --> 18:48.260
of the scorecards, so that's really cool.

18:48.260 --> 18:51.260
You know what's interesting about that movie, what makes it a lot more fun?

18:51.260 --> 18:56.340
If you imagine it being like 8th graders from your local Roosevelt Golf Land or your local

18:56.340 --> 19:01.740
arcade that pisses you off, and then every time they run in front of that area between

19:01.740 --> 19:04.900
the pad and the machine, that little necklace goes off and they explode.

19:04.900 --> 19:07.100
Hey, I'd join up for fun to kill them.

19:07.100 --> 19:11.020
Yeah, the best thing about that movie, it had the whole 90210 effect.

19:11.020 --> 19:12.980
You have 8th graders that are like 30.

19:12.980 --> 19:15.740
And you have your different types.

19:15.740 --> 19:17.940
You have the slut, you have the prep.

19:17.940 --> 19:20.860
Then you have the loner guy and you have the nerds.

19:20.860 --> 19:21.860
The nerds were the best.

19:21.860 --> 19:22.860
The nerds were so cool.

19:22.860 --> 19:25.860
I want a pot lid to kill people with, because that would be so cool.

19:25.860 --> 19:26.860
The pot lid saved him.

19:26.860 --> 19:28.860
I know, that was the coolest part.

19:28.860 --> 19:32.420
I still think Jack did the best and kicked ass.

19:32.420 --> 19:33.420
Oh yeah.

19:33.420 --> 19:36.860
You might want to talk about Battle Royale 2, because we're given the website for it

19:36.860 --> 19:37.860
in the chat room right now by Jazz.

19:37.860 --> 19:40.860
Actually, if you can get the link out of my live journal and post it in there.

19:40.860 --> 19:43.860
Sure, actually Jazz just posted it in the chat room for our convenience.

19:43.860 --> 19:47.340
Ah, thank you.

19:47.340 --> 19:52.980
Battle Royale 2 is set after, of course, Battle Royale, about three years afterwards, with

19:52.980 --> 19:58.660
the survivor, and actually the other, I don't want to go into detail, there's another character

19:58.660 --> 20:01.340
who makes an important cameo, as far as I know.

20:01.340 --> 20:05.100
On that side, though, there's a cool thing, they have scenes of their rehearsal.

20:05.100 --> 20:09.100
I want to play with your pussy, ooh, ooh.

20:09.100 --> 20:12.780
Jamie, please stop playing with Irene's pussy on the show, ooh, can I fish your pussy?

20:12.780 --> 20:13.780
Yeah.

20:13.780 --> 20:14.780
Oh, oh, oh.

20:14.780 --> 20:15.780
Meow.

20:15.780 --> 20:18.540
Pussy is here for those that are shocked and amazed right now.

20:18.540 --> 20:20.780
Where did you get that from?

20:20.780 --> 20:21.780
Hot Gothic.

20:21.780 --> 20:23.660
A long time ago, like three years ago.

20:23.660 --> 20:24.660
Oh man.

20:24.660 --> 20:25.660
Yeah, I know.

20:25.660 --> 20:26.660
It's so cute.

20:26.660 --> 20:27.660
Yeah, and it's dead.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.660
It's got X's for eyes, and it's got a pink tongue.

20:29.660 --> 20:33.540
I have a panda for you at my house, by the way.

20:33.540 --> 20:34.540
Oh, thank you.

20:34.540 --> 20:38.380
It's got an opening where the pussy is, and it's pink inside.

20:38.380 --> 20:39.380
Yeah.

20:39.380 --> 20:40.380
The interior is pink.

20:40.380 --> 20:45.380
It's really cool, or whatever.

20:45.380 --> 20:49.220
That was a lovely image I'm sure, I'm sure our listeners are happy that we could share

20:49.220 --> 20:50.220
that with all of you.

20:50.220 --> 20:51.220
There's my cell phone.

20:51.220 --> 20:52.220
Here, somebody talk.

20:52.220 --> 20:54.140
Oh, I bet that's mine.

20:54.140 --> 20:56.140
We're lost.

20:56.140 --> 20:57.920
Hi.

20:57.920 --> 21:03.140
So anyway, we need to fill a little more time here.

21:03.140 --> 21:04.740
Let's look at this profile, this one chick.

21:04.740 --> 21:09.660
I guess the chick that makes a cameo in the beginning of Battle Royale 1 has a full part

21:09.660 --> 21:10.660
in the second movie.

21:10.660 --> 21:11.660
That should be fun.

21:11.660 --> 21:12.660
Oh, there they are.

21:12.660 --> 21:13.660
Yes they are.

21:13.660 --> 21:19.660
Oh, what the hell is this? There's some chick that looks like a Barbie doll that Chaz put in the chat room.

21:19.660 --> 21:22.660
Yeah, it looks like Christina Aguilera.

21:22.660 --> 21:25.660
That's scary. Anyway.

21:25.660 --> 21:28.660
Alright, enough about Battle Royale. Somebody wants to take the mic. Hi.

21:28.660 --> 21:32.660
You should have Dragon Ash in the next one.

21:32.660 --> 21:35.660
So, how was your week, Logie? What did you do?

21:35.660 --> 21:41.660
I worked on the website. Yes, I know there's nothing on there new right now.

21:41.660 --> 21:43.660
If you trust me tomorrow, you're going to be seeing differently.

22:11.660 --> 22:19.020
What will be coming up hopefully tomorrow, if I am able to zip everything up tonight,

22:19.020 --> 22:26.860
would be all the official sets for DDR, everything from First through Xtreme, so everything that's

22:26.860 --> 22:27.860
done so far.

22:27.860 --> 22:31.940
I have a question for you, Loki, because I was able to play your sim last night, and

22:31.940 --> 22:33.380
I actually got to play some songs.

22:33.380 --> 22:36.220
Usually there's so many people there that I never get to actually play the damn sim,

22:36.220 --> 22:37.220
I only get to watch it.

22:37.220 --> 22:38.460
I got to play it last night.

22:38.460 --> 22:43.720
Why are so many DWIs really badly synced, like the ones you get off the internet?

22:43.720 --> 22:46.440
Why are they so bad, sync-wise?

22:46.440 --> 22:47.900
Because people are stupid.

22:47.900 --> 22:50.620
Well, how are those allowed to be distributed?

22:50.620 --> 22:53.420
It's like, ugh, pisses me off.

22:53.420 --> 22:55.220
Don't people check their files?

22:55.220 --> 22:56.220
Nope.

22:56.220 --> 22:57.220
God.

22:57.220 --> 23:02.300
And a lot of times people just either make heavy steps or just make basic steps and really

23:02.300 --> 23:05.020
annoying shit like that, so you have to go back and fix them.

23:05.020 --> 23:14.020
So that's what I'm hoping to do also with releasing files on my site is it'll allow me to go in and check these files and be able to fix them.

23:14.020 --> 23:24.020
Because, you know, obviously put them on the internet, I want to make sure that they're nice and fixed, they have nice backgrounds, you know, with the artist name in the banners and all that wonderful stuff.

23:24.020 --> 23:26.020
So that's what I'll be working on.

23:26.020 --> 23:31.020
And, you know, just to forewarn everyone because obviously I'm sure people will be noticing this.

23:31.020 --> 23:35.020
All the sim files, you know, the official sets, are not created by me.

23:35.020 --> 23:38.020
Yes, I know, shocker, I didn't have the time to create.

23:38.020 --> 23:42.020
Thousands and thousands of sim files are already done and already synced.

23:42.020 --> 23:48.020
So, you know, I'm just sticking them on my website in case some of these other websites go down or it's just another place to find them.

23:48.020 --> 23:50.020
You know, bandwidth-wise or whatever.

23:50.020 --> 23:52.020
Hi, welcome back.

23:52.020 --> 23:59.020
But there will be some official stuff that will be exclusive to my site, such as the solo non-stops.

23:59.020 --> 24:04.100
Those are going to be all done by me and those are not anywhere to be found on the internet.

24:04.100 --> 24:05.100
Very cool.

24:05.100 --> 24:06.100
Very cool.

24:06.100 --> 24:07.100
That's about it.

24:07.100 --> 24:11.700
But, if you're looking for DDR Extreme stuff and pretty much anything else right now, two

24:11.700 --> 24:14.380
sites you can look at would be AmaniStyle.

24:14.380 --> 24:16.540
They've got a lot of the stuff on there.

24:16.540 --> 24:17.680
Or DDR UK.

24:17.680 --> 24:23.620
They've just opened their download section again to everyone instead of just level two

24:23.620 --> 24:25.340
members or whatever like that.

24:25.340 --> 24:30.700
you can go download everything and you know I swear by Lawrence you know on the

24:30.700 --> 24:37.100
website because he can just he sinks files better than anyone so but you know

24:37.100 --> 24:43.660
I took his files and put the CD tags for the money so I just like their

24:43.660 --> 24:48.700
tags better I don't know this is picky but they're all up there already will be

24:48.700 --> 24:52.420
all up tomorrow as soon as I upload them and there's gonna be a change with how

24:52.420 --> 24:57.120
you download them, it's going to be all through FTP now instead of just through the website

24:57.120 --> 25:03.420
because one, it will allow me to update it faster and two, the FTPs on regulated as far

25:03.420 --> 25:10.320
as bandwidth wise and the website, while normally you have unlimited bandwidth, they do watch

25:10.320 --> 25:14.640
if your site uses a lot of bandwidth, they're going to close you down and unfortunately

25:14.640 --> 25:20.560
my site is shared with stepmania.com and a bunch of other ones, so I don't want those

25:20.560 --> 25:24.280
is going down, so I'm going to take measures to prevent that.

25:24.280 --> 25:26.240
Very cool.

25:26.240 --> 25:28.320
Question from the chat room, Brak2000 wants to know,

25:28.320 --> 25:31.200
are you going to post announcer files?

25:31.200 --> 25:33.240
No, actually, I could probably do that.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.440
I have those.

25:34.440 --> 25:36.080
Well, he wants them.

25:36.080 --> 25:39.080
Well, maybe later this week.

25:39.080 --> 25:39.680
All right.

25:39.680 --> 25:47.480
If you want to join in the chat, just go to the website,

25:47.480 --> 25:50.960
calibomani.com because we're part of the calibomani family

25:50.960 --> 25:53.860
and then uh... orange lounge is right there on the front page click on orange lounge

25:53.860 --> 25:55.500
and you'll get another menu click on chat

25:55.500 --> 25:57.100
it's that easy

25:57.100 --> 26:00.640
you made a tower of pringles i'm so proud of you

26:00.640 --> 26:02.000
another call

26:02.000 --> 26:04.640
people turn your phones off

26:04.640 --> 26:07.440
i'm kidding

26:07.440 --> 26:08.800
was michael is mike here

26:08.800 --> 26:11.080
yeah but he's not here

26:11.080 --> 26:13.360
he got ice cream

26:13.360 --> 26:14.340
did he get me

26:14.340 --> 26:15.580
did he get me ice cream

26:15.580 --> 26:19.400
know it no one else i didn't usually

26:19.400 --> 26:22.040
i went and saw uh... dreamcatcher

26:22.040 --> 26:23.080
was any good

26:23.080 --> 26:24.880
all the file plan the sardis is

26:24.880 --> 26:25.840
kick-ass

26:25.840 --> 26:27.320
dreamcatcher well

26:27.320 --> 26:29.440
three pictures a lot of part jokes

26:29.440 --> 26:31.760
bad acting and uh...

26:31.760 --> 26:36.200
a giant worm alien it speaks with the british accent

26:36.200 --> 26:38.040
uh...

26:38.040 --> 26:40.080
actual understand that at all

26:40.080 --> 26:41.560
goodnight angel ray

26:41.560 --> 26:42.680
he speaks to the british

26:42.680 --> 26:45.800
but hilarious they've got one part in the movie because obviously all the

26:45.800 --> 26:48.740
aliens look like these giant worm pigs

26:48.740 --> 26:53.120
they make themselves look like you know the traditional looking alien

26:53.120 --> 26:55.560
gray humanoid thing with the weird eyes

26:55.560 --> 26:59.920
so basically there's one scene in the movie where they're going to destroy the alien ship

26:59.920 --> 27:01.640
and you see all these aliens going

27:01.640 --> 27:03.760
no don't hurt us

27:03.760 --> 27:05.040
well it's like uh...

27:05.040 --> 27:09.360
we're not infected don't hurt us we're not infected because there's this virus thing that's like

27:09.360 --> 27:11.000
pretty much killing these people

27:11.000 --> 27:19.000
And so, um, but as they start getting close, because, you know, obviously the military knows better, they start turning into these worm things and running away.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
I just thought it was funny that they were, like, gunning down all these aliens and that was happening.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
Right.

27:26.000 --> 27:35.000
But, yeah. Dreamcatcher, um, it was decent. I wouldn't go see it again. And, well, actually, it actually kind of sucked ass.

27:35.000 --> 27:45.000
But, next week, the core comes out, and that's who's going to really suck ass, so don't go see that one.

27:47.000 --> 27:55.000
Alright. Why don't we go to a quick break, I guess? Or is there any other Sim news you want to talk about, Logan? Things going on in the Sim world?

27:55.000 --> 28:07.000
The last one they had was from the 6th, so it's a couple weeks old, but they're working on it.

28:07.000 --> 28:27.000
Not in Bumani's cells, no. If you're looking for like other sim files, stuff like, you know, for 2DX and that kind of thing, Bumani's cells got some, you know, they're really working on their Bumani, on their Bumani sim files, they've got like a lot of 2DX stuff on there and BeatMania 3 and whatnot.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.040
So check them out for everything else, because they

28:30.040 --> 28:33.760
will have one of the most complete sym file collections.

28:33.760 --> 28:39.040
But DDR UK will probably have the best synced DDR DWIs.

28:39.040 --> 28:41.120
So I don't know.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.360
Then, of course, there's my site, which will have just a

28:43.360 --> 28:46.640
lot of shit, a whole bunch of stuff on there.

28:46.640 --> 28:47.780
So yeah.

28:47.780 --> 28:48.560
All right, cool.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.680
We're going to go to a break, and we'll be

28:51.680 --> 28:53.040
back in a little bit.

28:53.040 --> 28:54.320
We're going to do this break.

28:54.320 --> 28:58.280
We'll do, I don't know, what song can we do?

28:58.280 --> 28:59.280
Let's do something...

28:59.280 --> 29:00.280
Wait, wait, wait!

29:00.280 --> 29:01.280
I know!

29:01.280 --> 29:02.280
We'll play my song.

29:02.280 --> 29:03.280
Oh, scary.

29:03.280 --> 29:08.280
Okay, we'll play something that Loki wants us to play.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.280
Okay.

29:09.280 --> 29:10.280
Here.

29:10.280 --> 29:11.280
Da-da-da-da.

29:11.280 --> 29:13.800
What are we loading up here, Loki?

29:13.800 --> 29:18.560
We're loading up a really cool remix I just found on Monty Sims a while ago.

29:18.560 --> 29:19.920
Oh, that was cool!

29:19.920 --> 29:20.920
Okay, we'll play that.

29:20.920 --> 29:23.160
We're going to play the absolute happy mix.

29:23.160 --> 29:29.380
And then, I have a request for Calcutta, and a request for Guacamole Del Taco, I'll get

29:29.380 --> 29:32.700

29:32.700 --> 29:35.760
And we're gonna do the FUs of the week when we come back, so send those over to me by

29:35.760 --> 29:38.800
private message in the chatroom, but we'll also talk about some Amani news, we have that

29:38.800 --> 29:39.800
too.

29:39.800 --> 29:40.800
So, we'll be back!

29:40.800 --> 29:47.800
Thanks for listening to Orange Lawns Radio.

31:10.800 --> 31:39.800
One day when I got some weed, I told them who to help, I got some weed.

31:39.800 --> 31:43.800
I like to be shit and fat and be hooliching cause I'm fat now

31:43.800 --> 31:46.800
Uncle Dandie, he is rich, he's a sexy fat man

31:46.800 --> 31:50.800
And I know that he will help me as much as he can

31:50.800 --> 31:53.800
A sexy fat man is what I want to be

31:53.800 --> 31:57.800
But you're all over him but you want to ride with me

31:57.800 --> 32:00.800
I don't know why it's okay that I'm on my body

32:00.800 --> 32:04.800
But every speed in Calcutta is a fight

32:04.800 --> 32:07.800
Calcutta, I am a sexy starboy

32:07.800 --> 32:11.200

I love to fly the kashy

32:34.600 --> 32:36.000
I like it very much

32:36.000 --> 32:39.500
Even though I have no license, I always panic, but

32:39.500 --> 32:43.000
I can find me at my end, I can find me at my feet

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
And I have no problem getting very ugly

32:47.000 --> 32:50.500

Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

35:58.460 --> 36:02.540
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

36:02.540 --> 36:08.420
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

36:08.420 --> 36:09.420
Hello.

36:09.420 --> 36:10.420
That woman is scary.

36:10.420 --> 36:11.420
I saw her.

36:11.420 --> 36:12.420
Who's scary?

36:12.420 --> 36:13.420
The ganguro.

36:13.420 --> 36:14.420
Okay.

36:14.420 --> 36:16.180
Oh, the two we were just looking at from Battle Royale 2?

36:16.180 --> 36:16.680
Yeah.

36:16.680 --> 36:17.180
Oh, OK.

36:17.180 --> 36:18.180
No, shoot that picture.

36:18.180 --> 36:18.680
Go back.

36:18.680 --> 36:19.180
All right.

36:19.180 --> 36:19.680
Show her.

36:19.680 --> 36:20.180
Here we go.

36:20.180 --> 36:20.680
She is scary.

36:20.680 --> 36:22.180
She's going to be in Battle Royale 2.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.260
She looks like Christina Aguilera.

36:24.260 --> 36:30.260
She's what she's referred to as ganguro.

36:30.260 --> 36:33.920
You know, the super tan, the uber blonde, and the panda makeup.

36:33.920 --> 36:34.420
Ah.

36:37.180 --> 36:41.260
Which, from what I understand, are now a dying breed.

36:41.260 --> 36:41.940
So.

36:41.940 --> 36:43.940
I've got a long time to go home.

36:44.940 --> 36:46.940
We've got that to throw at Rob.

36:50.940 --> 36:52.940
Say hello, we've got some new guests in the house.

36:53.940 --> 36:55.940
Say hello to Asian Innovation.

36:56.940 --> 36:58.940
Word up fo' shizzle, my gizzle.

36:59.940 --> 37:00.940
How you doin'?

37:00.940 --> 37:01.940
Doin' alright.

37:01.940 --> 37:04.940
Could you possibly be here to promote anything tonight?

37:04.940 --> 37:06.940
Is my microphone on? Yeah, I think it is.

37:06.940 --> 37:07.940
Yeah, it is on.

37:07.940 --> 37:12.940
Alright, because if yours is off, then this one's off too, and that would be bad.

37:12.940 --> 37:17.940
Okay, so I'll turn it off.

37:17.940 --> 37:18.940
That's right.

37:18.940 --> 37:21.940
Are you here to promote anything tonight, by chance?

37:21.940 --> 37:25.940
Yeah, I'm here to promote Orange Lounge.

37:25.940 --> 37:26.940
Woo!

37:26.940 --> 37:27.940
Definitely.

37:27.940 --> 37:33.940
We're sponsored by Pringles Original, Potato Chris.

37:33.940 --> 37:47.300
For you who speak Spanish, papitas cuyen tes, and three flavors, original sour cumin onion

37:47.300 --> 37:52.540
and cheese-ums, not to confuse with Cheez-Its.

37:52.540 --> 37:59.660
Also we are also sponsored by Kelby, shrimp flavored chips, remember they're always baked,

37:59.660 --> 38:00.660
not fried.

38:00.660 --> 38:03.380
They taste like Long John Silver, I don't like them.

38:03.380 --> 38:07.900
I don't know why they're, we're sponsored by them, but we're sponsored by Propel, which

38:07.900 --> 38:11.780
is, yeah.

38:11.780 --> 38:13.980
We're also sponsored by Triple Black.

38:13.980 --> 38:20.040
By Triple Black, Smirnoff Ice, which I'm going to get about ten of those later.

38:20.040 --> 38:21.040
And the guacamole chips!

38:21.040 --> 38:24.540
I don't even have to tell the brand, because you know how good it is.

38:24.540 --> 38:28.500
Alright, on to the real topics.

38:28.500 --> 38:31.020
Next week, there's going to be a tournament.

38:31.020 --> 38:32.020
No.

38:32.020 --> 38:35.020
Yeah, there isn't. It's off. It's cancelled. Sorry.

38:37.020 --> 38:38.020
Haha, fooled you.

38:38.020 --> 38:41.020
Not really. I'm serious. We're not having a tournament...

38:41.020 --> 38:45.020
Oh, wait. I was thinking about the home run derby. My bad.

38:48.020 --> 38:50.020
Do that again.

38:54.020 --> 38:56.020
That's pretty kinky.

38:58.020 --> 39:01.020
Also, we have another special guest in the house.

39:01.020 --> 39:03.020
Many of you guys maybe have heard him before.

39:03.020 --> 39:05.020
Give it up for...

39:05.020 --> 39:10.020
This is Dchild, the dark child in the heezy pacheezy.

39:10.020 --> 39:14.020
Otherwise known as MGL player number three.

39:14.020 --> 39:18.020
Yes, he's been around longer since...

39:18.020 --> 39:22.020
Since any of you guys were fucking playing this game.

39:22.020 --> 39:25.020
Yeah, he's been around since 1910 and um...

39:25.020 --> 39:27.020
I think in those days I was probably going,

39:27.020 --> 39:31.520
What's this DDR crap? I'll play Busta Move.

39:31.520 --> 39:37.020
Yeah, I'll remind you, he's been playing since DDR used to cost $18,000 a machine.

39:37.020 --> 39:39.020
It's been that long.

39:39.020 --> 39:43.520
But back on topic, yeah, it costs $18,000 a play.

39:43.520 --> 39:47.520
Are you here promoting anything tonight? Teach out.

39:47.520 --> 39:54.020
I'm promoting that right now I'm still most of the way single, so yeah, I'm promoting myself.

39:54.020 --> 39:56.020
Most of the way? Who's got your other part?

39:56.020 --> 39:57.020
Got your back cover?

39:57.020 --> 40:00.020
Her name's Susie, but there's nothing official yet, so I don't know.

40:00.020 --> 40:02.020
I think I still see you go.

40:02.020 --> 40:05.020
So if you want to come on down to March Madness.

40:05.020 --> 40:06.020
Yeah.

40:06.020 --> 40:12.020
All right, there's a tournament coming up, March Madness.

40:12.020 --> 40:17.020
If any of you watch NCAA college basketball, you already know the format.

40:17.020 --> 40:19.020
If not, let me break it down for you.

40:19.020 --> 40:24.020
It's like the WWF, 64, Hell in a Cell match.

40:24.020 --> 40:25.020
No, not really.

40:25.020 --> 40:29.100
This is going to be 64 people all in bracketed play.

40:29.100 --> 40:30.780
And

40:30.780 --> 40:34.420
basically you screw off head to head against each other. You will be seated

40:34.420 --> 40:36.140
like the NCAA tournament.

40:36.140 --> 40:40.660
So basically if you're from SoCal or NorCal or any other state

40:40.660 --> 40:44.220
we're going to try to keep you guys separate from one another.

40:44.220 --> 40:47.060
We're basically going to take your abilities

40:47.060 --> 40:50.700
and we're going to rank you accordingly.

40:50.700 --> 40:54.120
And every match will be one song only

40:54.120 --> 40:57.340
and the person with more perfects will advance to the next round

40:57.340 --> 41:00.600
and the winner must win six grueling matches

41:00.600 --> 41:05.220
because i will make it especially tough for you

41:05.220 --> 41:07.880
as a hint i guess i'll

41:07.880 --> 41:11.200
there's sixty four matches i will tell you one song in the tournament you guys should

41:11.200 --> 41:12.420
practice

41:12.420 --> 41:13.680
practice bag

41:13.680 --> 41:17.540
haha

41:17.540 --> 41:21.880
no i hate that song

41:21.880 --> 41:25.340
i'm being told about freestyle well we'll talk about freestyle

41:25.340 --> 41:28.060
yeah ourselves

41:28.060 --> 41:31.620
yeah uh... i'm also taking freestyle to new level i want to get some uh...

41:31.620 --> 41:34.080
reality dvd are going

41:34.080 --> 41:38.780
so we're basing it off american idol with the idol

41:38.780 --> 41:42.380
uh... i have a releases yet but i will tell you guys the judges now since we're

41:42.380 --> 41:46.540
only one week away ok let's hear it

41:46.540 --> 41:49.900
of course you guys almost simon paula and randy

41:49.900 --> 41:52.200
our versions of simon pollard mandy

41:52.200 --> 41:53.960
i'll start with

41:53.960 --> 41:55.460
randy

41:55.460 --> 41:56.920
he is

41:56.920 --> 42:00.060
someone that has your credentials

42:00.060 --> 42:04.400
he's someone that has won tournaments and he's someone that uses dog in every

42:04.400 --> 42:06.260
sentence

42:06.260 --> 42:08.800
we can't go wrong it's melby

42:08.800 --> 42:12.880
all yes lately i think i think we we might have a little clip of melby here

42:12.880 --> 42:15.040
somewhere

42:15.040 --> 42:18.360
by this will be a part of the area

42:18.360 --> 42:22.560
That's right! That's right!

42:22.560 --> 42:26.300
Alright, on to Paula. Some of you might know her, some of you might not.

42:26.300 --> 42:29.960
She's a SoCal DDR player. I know Paula Abdul.

42:29.960 --> 42:35.500
Yeah. She also goes by the handle

42:35.500 --> 42:38.980
She also goes by the handle GoodAttackGirl. Her name is Angela.

42:38.980 --> 42:39.940
Is she sweet?

42:39.940 --> 42:41.400
Yeah, she is.

42:41.400 --> 42:42.540
That's awesome.

42:42.540 --> 42:47.780
She'll try to keep Simon in check.

42:47.780 --> 42:52.240
Alright, many of you have been wondering, who is Simon gonna be?

42:52.240 --> 42:58.140
Well, many people have wanted to be Simon, including our own Loki, kept begging. We got people in the chatroom begging.

42:58.140 --> 43:01.580
But it's already been sealed, right? The deal's been sealed a long time ago, right?

43:01.580 --> 43:08.280
Yes. You signed a deal with the devil. Basically, before the tournament even started, I secured my Simon.

43:08.280 --> 43:12.840
Because if I would have gotten this person a Simon, I think this tournament would have been on hold.

43:12.840 --> 43:18.100
This is someone that won't be afraid to tell you to your face that you suck shit.

43:18.100 --> 43:23.840
He'll tell you to your face that he'll never want to see you on the DDR platform ever again.

43:23.840 --> 43:28.220
This person will also tell you, you know,

43:28.220 --> 43:30.860
not to ever put a quarter in the machine.

43:30.860 --> 43:33.020
He'll tell you that you're ugly.

43:33.020 --> 43:35.360
He'll tell you that your routine was ugly.

43:35.360 --> 43:37.540
He'll tell you you can't dance.

43:37.540 --> 43:41.300
He'll tell you you're the worst dancer in America.

43:41.300 --> 43:45.020
He won't even tell you he might be the worst DDR player in the world

43:45.020 --> 43:48.400
or even the universe.

43:48.400 --> 43:52.240
But I don't think I'll tell you guys, because I want to keep the suspense for a week.

43:52.240 --> 43:54.780
Oh, come on. Just a hint?

43:54.780 --> 43:58.940
Okay, I think you guys should know. Alright, yeah, yeah, tell us.

43:58.940 --> 44:01.060
He's none other than...

44:01.060 --> 44:05.280
Josh, failure, be afraid.

44:05.280 --> 44:08.780
Be very afraid.

44:08.780 --> 44:11.260
uh... that will be fun

44:11.260 --> 44:15.660
had your egos

44:15.660 --> 44:17.900
all right so um...

44:17.900 --> 44:20.460
that should be interesting something a good group of judges now

44:20.460 --> 44:23.780
are you going to be announcing america hours that wait till the

44:23.780 --> 44:24.500
next week

44:24.500 --> 44:26.560
uh... so we don't

44:26.560 --> 44:30.500
give away everything we're not going to have america announced

44:30.500 --> 44:31.600
sounds fair

44:31.600 --> 44:35.780
and also arm just so you know ryan seacrest uh... we're gonna have to

44:35.780 --> 44:37.180
co-hosts

44:37.180 --> 44:39.580
So you got Dunkleman back?

44:39.580 --> 44:44.100
We're going to have co-hosts, so it's going to be fun.

44:44.100 --> 44:47.020
Definitely fun.

44:47.020 --> 44:50.340
You going to talk about who that is, or is that a surprise to you?

44:50.340 --> 44:52.620
I think it's better if you find out next week.

44:52.620 --> 44:55.020
Many surprises.

44:55.020 --> 44:58.060
Yeah, you have to come to figure it out. Or if you're too far away, like if you're on the east

44:58.060 --> 44:59.620
coast and something can't make it out here,

44:59.620 --> 45:04.180
you have to tune in live, because we'll be broadcasting it live, and you'll find all that out, because we'll tell you.

45:04.180 --> 45:07.980
I think all those people on the East Coast should just, you know, bite the bullet and get a plane ticket.

45:07.980 --> 45:15.180
Ride the Amtrak, use a Greyhound, hitchhike, sell yourself to be at this tournament.

45:15.180 --> 45:21.080
And don't worry, Sacramento doesn't really have any large skyscrapers, so you're still good.

45:21.080 --> 45:23.880
Folsom has a dam.

45:23.880 --> 45:25.980
What about nuclear power plants?

45:25.980 --> 45:29.780
Uh, they shut down Rancho Sego years ago, right?

45:29.780 --> 45:31.780
What about all the Air Force bases we have here?

45:31.780 --> 45:32.780
Shh!

45:33.780 --> 45:36.780
They all keep getting bought out and privatized.

45:38.780 --> 45:39.780
Yeah.

45:39.780 --> 45:43.780
Alright, so, are there any other things about March Madness we gotta talk about?

45:43.780 --> 45:45.780
Oh my god, oh my god, we should bomb RBGL.

45:46.780 --> 45:48.780
Yeah, that's the only thing you have to worry about.

45:48.780 --> 45:49.780
I second that notion.

45:49.780 --> 45:56.780
But, I will have to say, this is one of the tournaments that you actually want to participate in,

45:56.780 --> 46:04.660
in because last year was so much fun I mean going through the 64 people and 32

46:04.660 --> 46:09.980
matches who really gives a shit about the 7-10 matchup right so it ended up being

46:09.980 --> 46:14.880
one of the most exciting matches in the first round hyperbroken versus liquid

46:14.880 --> 46:19.940
blue it's a it's just a little blast from the past but uh what happened was

46:19.940 --> 46:25.180
hyperbroken was the number 10 seed liquid blue was the seventh seed and

46:25.180 --> 46:31.360
And Liquid Blue was lucky enough to get his song, La Señorita, but Hyperbroken won by

46:31.360 --> 46:38.100
one great and everyone in the building was chanting, upset, upset.

46:38.100 --> 46:43.380
And who could forget Chubz taking out the number one Inuan.

46:43.380 --> 46:47.020
I think this year there's going to be much more upsets.

46:47.020 --> 46:50.900
The way it's structured, one win all the way throughout so nothing is guaranteed.

46:50.900 --> 46:53.900
You can get your song and run the table.

46:53.900 --> 46:56.900
Anyways, you want to say anything? Darkshot?

46:59.100 --> 47:02.020
I'm wondering if we're going to have our great white ninja.

47:03.340 --> 47:10.260
I don't know. The great white ninja's in Wisconsin right now. It's kind of hard to get a ninja, you know, magically appear here.

47:10.260 --> 47:18.180
Well, I have been asked to let it be known to the Asian innovation that the Caucasian innovation, 23rd Magus,

47:18.180 --> 47:24.500
will do a max unlimited routine, a DDR idol.

47:24.500 --> 47:29.380
Be prepared to have your statements on video tape.

47:29.380 --> 47:32.660
Let it be known.

47:32.660 --> 47:37.380
Alright, by the way, we will be producing a DVD eventually with this tournament, so

47:37.380 --> 47:44.380
if you guys miss it, you will be able to relive all the moments again with commentary.

47:44.380 --> 47:48.380
I'm on DVD. I'm on DVD. Sweet.

47:48.380 --> 47:52.380
Trust me, this'll be just like Jackass.

47:52.380 --> 47:56.380
Hey, could my double-trick paranoia routine be a special feature?

47:56.380 --> 48:00.380
Yeah, baby, yeah.

48:00.380 --> 48:04.380
This is how Dick Vitale does it. Yeah, baby, yeah!

48:04.380 --> 48:08.380
Maybe we should get the bats.

48:08.380 --> 48:12.380
Yeah, maybe Jamie and I will do a reprise of our Miggle II routine. That'll be fun.

48:12.380 --> 48:19.380
and

48:20.580 --> 48:23.700
we're trying to give a little side thing we do like the bake sale was a big hit

48:23.700 --> 48:26.260
it's after trying to get a sighted Twinkies

48:26.260 --> 48:28.020
and we're thinking it's which

48:28.020 --> 48:30.940
we're just gonna sell fried Twinkies the hell with everything else to be a fried

48:30.940 --> 48:33.380
Twinkie sale I don't know no I don't even know if that's gonna happen we'll

48:33.380 --> 48:34.220
see

48:34.220 --> 48:39.180
we're trying to figure out something cute that we drive Twinkies

48:39.180 --> 48:46.220
One very cool thing that's going to be run on the side of March Madness is a 2DX tournament.

48:46.220 --> 48:51.520
I believe, am I not correct, this is NorCal's first big 2DX tournament, correct?

48:51.520 --> 48:52.520
I think so, yeah.

48:52.520 --> 48:54.120
I think so.

48:54.120 --> 48:58.440
So the very first 2DX tournament will be this weekend.

48:58.440 --> 48:59.440
And guess what?

48:59.440 --> 49:03.200
We're going to announce the qualifying songs here live, but we'll do that after the FUs.

49:03.200 --> 49:05.400
You want to do it right now?

49:05.400 --> 49:06.400
Right now?

49:06.400 --> 49:08.040
Alright, let's talk about it.

49:08.040 --> 49:15.240
Now, what's funny about this, only like four people in the whole world know about the 2DX

49:15.240 --> 49:16.480
qualifiers right now.

49:16.480 --> 49:18.240
Mike doesn't even know.

49:18.240 --> 49:23.080
It's his dang tournament, the March Madness, but he doesn't know.

49:23.080 --> 49:24.920
But you're going to be competing in 2DX, right?

49:24.920 --> 49:25.920
Yes, I will.

49:25.920 --> 49:28.440
All right, so it would be good to get some reactions from some contestants here live

49:28.440 --> 49:29.440
on air.

49:29.440 --> 49:32.720
So let's talk about what those qualifiers are going to be.

49:32.720 --> 49:36.000
All right, here we go.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.160
I gotta bring them up, so fill time.

49:38.160 --> 49:42.120
Tell us more about how the 2DX tournament will work, Jamie.

49:42.120 --> 49:44.000
You hit the keys,

49:44.000 --> 49:47.240
and turn the slidey thing,

49:47.240 --> 49:48.940
and you make a song.

49:48.940 --> 49:50.440
That's how 2DX works.

49:50.440 --> 49:54.040
Really, the way it's going to work is qualifiers are going to have two songs

49:54.040 --> 49:57.720
that they have to play, higher score moves on, basically.

49:57.720 --> 50:01.440
And the rest of it's going to go like that. However, for anyone who went to Shaft,

50:01.440 --> 50:04.240
the rest of the tournament is going to work very much like Shaft worked, where we have the

50:04.240 --> 50:05.800
categories with the songs.

50:05.800 --> 50:08.240
and the categories by the way

50:08.240 --> 50:11.560
in our minds they're associated with the songs they may not necessarily be that

50:11.560 --> 50:12.840
way in your mind

50:12.840 --> 50:15.000
uh... and uh...

50:15.000 --> 50:16.200
it's going to be challenging

50:16.200 --> 50:18.400
we can put it that way it's going to be challenging

50:18.400 --> 50:22.340
but it's uh... it'll be it'll be a fun tournament and

50:22.340 --> 50:24.660
i don't think anyone's going to walk away from that being

50:24.660 --> 50:26.620
really unsatisfied

50:26.620 --> 50:29.720
unless you start qualifying to be another

50:29.720 --> 50:34.100
we're not going to get that

50:34.100 --> 50:38.100
It might get harder though in the later rounds. Definitely would get harder in the later rounds.

50:38.100 --> 50:40.100
But we're not going to say anything about that.

50:44.100 --> 50:46.100
What about squeezing crotch?

50:46.100 --> 50:52.100
Dude, this ferret, these noises he's making. You have to squeeze his crotch to make these noises.

50:52.100 --> 50:55.100
I'd be making noises if someone squeezed my crotch.

50:58.100 --> 51:00.100
Last week on Orange Lounge.

51:00.100 --> 51:02.100
We don't do those anymore, you know?

51:02.100 --> 51:05.100
I got lazy, so I stopped doing those flashback clicks.

51:05.100 --> 51:09.100
And yes, we will be announcing qualifiers here in just a second. I'm just queuing some stuff up.

51:09.100 --> 51:13.100
I'll do them when we get in our new place. I'll make them evil.

51:13.100 --> 51:15.100
And we're sponsored by Pringles.

51:15.100 --> 51:19.100
I'm sponsored by Propel and the letter Z.

51:19.100 --> 51:23.100
I thought that was what they said about sex.

51:23.100 --> 51:28.100
Once you pop it. Yeah, you don't stop it.

51:28.100 --> 51:31.100
Too bad these Pringles taste like shit.

51:31.100 --> 51:35.220
Yeah, actually sex tastes like shit too depending on what kind you do

51:36.100 --> 51:39.100
Dude, I don't know who you're having sex with it should it taste like that

51:40.500 --> 51:42.500
well depends on how you

51:47.660 --> 51:49.660
Wrong end

51:51.140 --> 51:53.140
That was a cartoon too

51:54.740 --> 51:58.140
We have an unpaid sponsor now www.rotten.com

51:58.140 --> 52:06.140
www.styleproject.com

52:28.140 --> 52:33.140
Followed by, oh I should say deadline 7 key, followed by the safari light 7.

52:40.140 --> 52:47.140
Alright that's the first pair, deadline and safari light 7. The second pair that you can pick from is air flow 7 key.

52:48.140 --> 52:49.140
That song sucks.

52:49.140 --> 52:54.300
Sorry, I pulled these really quickly.

52:54.300 --> 53:00.340
And the partner song to that is Kotei wo Muteo from 6th- I'm sorry, Kotei wo Muteo from 6th

53:00.340 --> 53:01.340
Style.

53:01.340 --> 53:08.900
Okay, I know I'm not going to be picking that pair.

53:08.900 --> 53:13.140
Third pair that you can pick from, this is the third pair, is Cheer Train.

53:13.140 --> 53:15.140
The hell is Cheer Train?

53:18.740 --> 53:23.400
Okay, and that's partnered with Abyss

53:29.820 --> 53:35.340
And the third pair is Indigo Vision

53:35.340 --> 53:57.900
one. And that's partnered with Spooky. The last pair is Alien World. Well, that's an

53:57.900 --> 54:04.900
It's an easy one, but it's partnered with Rizlim.

54:09.300 --> 54:10.760
So there they are.

54:10.760 --> 54:12.780
Those are the qualifying songs for the 2DX tournament.

54:12.780 --> 54:15.140
What the fuck is Cheer Train?

54:15.140 --> 54:16.420
You want to hear Cheer Train one more time?

54:16.420 --> 54:18.220
Was that a side quest of Final Fantasy VIII?

54:18.220 --> 54:23.100
No, it's from 7th Style.

54:23.100 --> 54:27.140
I'll play some of those during the breaks so you can get refreshed with those songs.

54:27.140 --> 54:31.540
Yes, songs were kind of picked on purpose, half songs people play and half people don't

54:31.540 --> 54:36.380
play. Let me run down those one more time. These are the pairs you can pick from to qualify

54:36.380 --> 54:40.940
with for the 2DX Tournament of March Madness. First pair are Deadline, Seven Key, and Safari,

54:40.940 --> 54:45.940
Light Seven. Second pair is Airflow, and pronounce that for me because I'm too white.

54:45.940 --> 54:47.940
Where?

54:47.940 --> 54:49.940
Uh...

54:49.940 --> 54:51.940
Thank you very much.

55:19.940 --> 55:32.940
p0k3smot42o I can pass half of those songs and the other half I can't pass

55:32.940 --> 55:34.940
p0k3smot42o Which one is the one with your train?

55:34.940 --> 55:35.940
p0k3smot42o Abyss

55:35.940 --> 55:38.940
p0k3smot42o I failed Abyss with a vengeance today, I got a 12 on it

55:38.940 --> 55:46.940
Okay, so, hooray for that.

55:46.940 --> 55:51.180
As promised, during this segment we would get to the FUs of the Week, so if we're done

55:51.180 --> 55:54.740
talking about March Madness now, you guys done?

55:54.740 --> 55:58.940
Is there anything else we need to say about March Madness?

55:58.940 --> 56:06.520
Okay well let's do the FUs of the Week, and you know, since Asian Innovation and Dark

56:06.520 --> 56:09.280
Your child has never been here for the Effie's of the Week, Jamie, why don't you explain

56:09.280 --> 56:10.560
to them how it works?

56:10.560 --> 56:12.520
Busy opening my propel, fuck you.

56:12.520 --> 56:16.520
Um, oh wait, um, that is exactly it.

56:16.520 --> 56:20.680
Fuck yous of the week are where you talk about shit you're pissed off about.

56:20.680 --> 56:22.360
That's it.

56:22.360 --> 56:25.680
Anything that you want to give a fuck you to, just tell them right now on the air.

56:25.680 --> 56:29.000
They may not be listening, but oh well, it feels better to get it out.

56:29.000 --> 56:32.440
I fucking hate the fucking gas prices fucking going on fucking right now.

56:32.440 --> 56:33.440
You gotta wait your turn.

56:33.440 --> 56:35.440
You gotta wait your turn.

56:35.440 --> 56:36.440
Fuck!

56:36.440 --> 56:49.000
So, with that being said, let's get started, shall we, Jamie?

56:49.000 --> 56:50.000
This is fucked up.

56:50.000 --> 56:55.440
My first lecture of the week goes for being unemployed, but also being unemployed is a

56:55.440 --> 57:00.080
good thing because my life is much more enjoyable since I can go wake up at two in the afternoon

57:00.080 --> 57:06.360
and go to Scandinavia, play 2DX for three hours, and then go back home and sleep.

57:06.360 --> 57:10.360
My car is still not being tuned up, although they're doing everything they can.

57:10.360 --> 57:12.360
I'm being patient about it.

57:12.360 --> 57:17.360
But, um, it's been a while, okay? It's just been a while.

57:17.360 --> 57:20.360
Um, also it goes toward people who can't drive.

57:20.360 --> 57:25.360
And it goes toward, um, the particular exit from the Boston Market parking lot.

57:25.360 --> 57:26.360
So you can see the light.

57:26.360 --> 57:28.360
And for the woman who looked like a troll.

57:28.360 --> 57:29.360
You remember her?

57:29.360 --> 57:31.360
Oh yeah, she looked kind of funny.

57:31.360 --> 57:33.360
The woman in the white car who...

57:33.360 --> 57:34.360
I seriously thought...

57:34.360 --> 57:37.360
You've seen that movie Troll, right?

57:37.360 --> 57:39.360
She looked like Troll.

57:39.360 --> 57:42.360
Except she was not great.

57:42.360 --> 57:44.360
She was going to live under a bridge.

57:44.360 --> 57:47.360
Yeah, she was driving through a bridge.

57:47.360 --> 57:52.360
And then my other Bucky goes toward...

57:52.360 --> 57:56.360
Toward not being able to get anything else to say about you two.

57:56.360 --> 58:00.360
I wasn't going to say it.

58:00.360 --> 58:07.360
Hire me! Thank you.

58:10.160 --> 58:16.840
There's a big huge, like, knot in the cord here. I mean, we're talking, like, massive knot here.

58:16.840 --> 58:19.920
That's a f*** you. That is a big huge knot.

58:19.920 --> 58:25.560
If you didn't rob for keeping his cords all knotted. Of course, I can't really say much about that because you should see it on my computer.

58:25.560 --> 58:28.000
It's like a giant, massive cord.

58:28.000 --> 58:29.960
anyways uh...

58:29.960 --> 58:32.700
and i had only a

58:32.700 --> 58:36.840
at the mcdonald's for putting their breaking uh... condiments and everything

58:36.840 --> 58:38.100
under the cheese

58:38.100 --> 58:40.720
i was sure i don't like people that i thought you know

58:40.720 --> 58:41.820
cheeseburgers

58:41.820 --> 58:45.040
if i never asked for him to take off because i think that the time in their

58:45.040 --> 58:46.140
slow as it is

58:46.140 --> 58:48.360
so this dumb bitch with it

58:48.360 --> 58:50.260
fucking people underneath

58:50.260 --> 58:53.720
where you can i get at people's because they're under the season melted over

58:53.720 --> 58:54.600
enough

58:54.600 --> 58:58.500
So, it pissed me off because I was biting into the hamburger, and at first I looked at it and go,

58:58.500 --> 59:00.100
Oh look, no pickles on this!

59:00.100 --> 59:04.200
And they didn't put any condiments. I bite into it, taste pickle, and get pissed.

59:04.200 --> 59:07.800
So, you're so stupid, you can't even- you fucked up a burger!

59:07.800 --> 59:09.500
How easy is that?

59:09.500 --> 59:11.000
Fucking a bur-

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Put the shit together!

59:13.000 --> 59:15.300
You're fucking a burger?

59:15.300 --> 59:16.800
They're fucking a burger!

59:16.800 --> 59:18.700
They're fucking up a burger!

59:18.700 --> 59:20.000
Well, that explains a lot.

59:20.000 --> 59:23.200
What the hell?

59:23.200 --> 59:30.200
You were complaining, I fixed it.

59:33.680 --> 59:37.240
Fuck you two, uh, microphones are already low.

59:37.240 --> 59:44.480
Your remix, uh, Darksacker, that's not coming along because it's just, I don't know, not good.

59:44.480 --> 59:51.480
I feed him aim for having a headache. I don't know what's coming from. I don't know.

59:51.480 --> 59:55.880
damn you know it sucks because i was really angsty earlier this morning but then after

59:55.880 --> 01:00:00.280
hearing that miyazaki's uh screwed away one i just kind of forgot about everything

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:08.600
uh i guess we could just cover the regular stuff gas print oh oh oh this is this is a major one

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:14.040
fb did a stupid war in cnn for cutting in on my favorite favorite stations i don't give a

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:19.880
fuck about watching an explosion that happened six hours ago numerous times all day long look

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:23.240
it's bombing look there's bombing going on no shit what do you think they're

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:27.080
doing over there having a rave having a party is everyone getting along i don't

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:30.360
care about your fucking bombing and seeing the little explosion if i wanted

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:35.640
to see explosions i'd watch fireworks you know it's stupid and i don't give a

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:39.080
crap about half the stuff they have on there yahoo news now there's like the

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:43.800
print is so small because there's so many stupid you know headlines on there

01:00:43.800 --> 01:01:03.800
I can't read any of it. It's like, uhhh, soldiers, something, something. It's annoying. I just really wish. If I wanted to watch 24 hour news, I'd tune in to CNN. I don't want CNN on another station because I'm trying to watch, you know, some other show like American Idol or something like that.

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:31.080
p0k3smot42o

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:34.760
That sucks.

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:35.760
F you to being tired.

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:38.760
I got tired way too easy the other...

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:41.120
I got tired way too easy last night.

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:42.120
I'm feeling old.

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:43.120
I wasn't even drunk.

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:44.320
There's no excuse for that.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:45.720
And F you to Anita.

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.720
Wink wink nudge nudge.

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:48.720
Just like I did at faces, baby.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:54.200
Okay, I'm older than you, and if you feel older than me, then you suck.

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.200
F that.

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:57.000
Alright, moving on.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Let's go around the room.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Who wants to start?

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.520
there was zero

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:07.440
my baby's mama

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:09.000
i'm not even saying anything

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.400
but about

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:13.200
watching fireworks bombs are really really big fireworks

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:16.320
that blow up people's houses and buildings

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:19.480
but i didn't see any bodies flying in the air nothing happening there

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:22.560
like earlier today they just had a picture of the night sky there

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.760
no no hold on hold on

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:27.320
hear that in the distance there's bombing going on

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:34.120
where we can't see it! But we're still showing the goddamn city! Who cares? Turn it off!

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:37.420
Do some other news! I'm sure there's something else happening in the world other than the

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:41.420
stupid bombing. You know, everything's stopped. Just for the bombing.

01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:47.920
No, but I gotta, like, the only thing I really like about watching those is when they make

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:51.840
you listen to all the gunfire and all the stuff, you know somebody's dying somewhere,

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:55.920
or someone just got blown up, and that's the coolest part about the world.

01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:01.360
news showed the caravan and then they showed camels and goats following following the tanks

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:07.280
yeah after some stupid fucking guy says yeah we see camels out here and they're very distressed

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:13.440
it's like whatever but anyways back to my fus one i have an fu two well kind of war related

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:20.720
there's a stupid guy in the uk and i know he's listening stop sending me fucking yeah or ims

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:27.500
over MSN messenger telling me to go on busy for 15 minutes to like grieve the 15 UK soldiers

01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:34.500
who died. I'm not going to go on a 15 minute busy every damn 15 fucking minutes. You know,

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:40.280
you might be an absolute sort of stupid loser and who the hell cares. Get a life and get

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:47.280
off the internet and go do something. Oh my god. Say that again. Well because Dreamcatcher

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:52.280
Well, because Dreamcatcher told me that British people are aliens anyways.

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:57.280
Giant worm aliens. They're shit weasels. They fly out of your ass.

01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:59.280
Like Sam Cassell.

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.280
Yeah.

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:08.280
My other F.U. is to my computer. I just got a new webcam, and it'll install it, and then give me a fucking warning every damn time I try to open a stupid program.

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.280
Give me your webcam. You can have mine.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:15.280
If it works, I mean, mine's just stupid.

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:31.280
Yeah, okay, well I might have to re-install the whole thing, but anyways, um, another F.U. is to like, the friggin', whatchya call it, like, not having money sucks, but I got money yesterday though, so I'm okay with that.

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:40.280
Um, an F.U. is to the stupid bastard who decided it'd be a good idea to take off the damn yard sale signs at my mom's yard sale, so I had to go and fucking put up all ten of them again.

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:44.280
And if I ever see you again, because I know who you are, I swear to God I will kill you.

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:53.280
Another F.U. is to the stupid shrimp chips, because they're too addicting and they make me sick. What?

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:56.280
Sponsored by Kelby.

01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:01.280
That's all I really got right now. Oh yeah, stupid.

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:08.280
Fuck you to the stupid Road to Perdition getting the best cinematog- just winning for cinematography.

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:15.280
It should have gone to the games of New York because they actually did really well and that's all I got to say, Sanda.

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:18.280
Why? One last thing, you are cool.

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:28.280
Alright, first off, I want to give some fuck yous out to everyone that is listening. Thank you very, very much.

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:35.280
Alright, the next fuck you goes out to the tomahawk missiles, the cruise missiles, and the patriot missiles.

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:41.440
Each missile costs us about one to two million each. We're launching billions of missiles on the air atmosphere

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:46.080
You know all that money that we've been spending on these fucking missiles could be going to the Somalians

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:50.960
So we can be feeding the Somalians give them the food and building future terrorists, you know

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:54.240
So what I think we're killing two birds in one store right now, aren't we?

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:56.760
alright

01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:01.960
Yeah, yeah my next fuck you goes out to Windows XP

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:15.960
Today, I was trying to install a pirated copy of Windows XP, but I tried to get a Windows update, and it won't let me because it was pirated.

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:17.960
What the fuck? Why would I even?

01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:20.960
I got a corporate version for you if you want it.

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:27.960
Alright, uh, fuck you to Professional Windows XP. Amen to the corporate versions.

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:42.960
Alright, fuck, okay, my next fuck you goes out to all these people on the freeway to that speed that don't know how to drive.

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:48.320
Cuz on my way to Sacramento today, I was stuck in traffic. No, not because traffic was slow

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:51.840
But because some idiots decided to get into a car accident

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:56.880
Yes, they did decide to get into it cuz they were driving probably 150 miles an hour in a 70 zone

01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:00.520
But it's alright cuz they're on stretchers now and they're feeling the pain

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:03.400
Intense, don't be stupid

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:09.560
Let me see, what is my next fuck you go to? I had it a second ago. Oh come back to me

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:11.960
I'll pass it on until I get it back

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:17.560
I'm gonna use this mic cuz it's a bit better I got a lot of fuck yous first

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:23.780
off fuck you to all your stupid high horse prissy little DDR players that

01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:27.000
make fun of all those people who are just beginning or you think are just

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.820
beginning I know who you motherfuckers are you guys were laughing at me when I

01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:35.200
was playing you have no idea who the hell I am I'm coming after you fools

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:41.940
next big fuck you I'm gonna get a lot of shit for this fuck you President Bush

01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:48.940
Bush. Fuck you and this goddamn war. Spending $400 billion on this goddamn war. $161 billion

01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:58.340
would solve all the problems with our education system. Fuck you, Bush. Or free the Somalians.

01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:04.940
Another big fuck you involved in the war. Fuck you, American media, and all your goddamn

01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:11.940
We're the media. We're indie, not American press. Indie press is cool. I ain't got nothing

01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:16.940
against them. Let's see, what other big fuck yous?

01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:21.460
Yeah, media needs to just stop telling us that they know shit, but then say, oh, but

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:27.900
we don't know that for sure. Whatever happened to that shuttle crash that,

01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:32.980
I don't know, took place a while back and then all of a sudden, oh, hey, war!

01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:39.980
What ever happened to, uh, what was that guy's name again? Um, what was it? Osama Bin Laden.

01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:44.980
Where's he? But anyways, another big fuck you. Gas prices.

01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:48.980
What about stories about how ugly Rosie O'Donnell is? Why don't I see those anymore?

01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:50.980
Because the lesbians gave up on that one.

01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:54.980
And did Michael Jackson just stop molesting kids all of a sudden, you know? Huh?

01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:59.980
And, uh, we've tried so hard to get Rosie O'Donnell out of her mind, so yeah.

01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:07.980
You know what's funny about this whole thing? They're never going to catch Sadam. He's just going to slip through again, and we're going to have this all in like another ten years, all over again.

01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:10.980
I think that he exists in a virtual reality.

01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:15.980
Osama bin Laden's hand is up Sadam's ass, that's where he is.

01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:19.980
Sadam's been dead for twenty years, how many of you guys know that? He's been using one of those doubles.

01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:23.980
But he has a live journal.

01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:32.980
So there's one post, because there's one computer that's actually connected to the internet.

01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:37.980
Good job!

01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:42.980
Okay, another fuck you. I don't remember your name. I don't remember what you look at.

01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:49.980
It was at Asian Innovations' birthday party. You showed up uninvited, but with Hyperbroken.

01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:52.980
You're not beef against HyperBroken. HyperBroken, you're cool, alright?

01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:58.980
But this motherfucker, tall ass, lanky white dude, he's about six foot three, you might know who he is.

01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:00.980
Oh shit, it's Brad.

01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:03.980
I only know his call name, I'm sorry.

01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:08.980
But this motherfucker, alright, I send money out with HyperBroken to pick up some drinks.

01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:14.980
That does not mean this motherfucker can then go and spend some of my goddamn money on his own personal drink.

01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:17.580
That's what tall, lanky-ass white boy did.

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:23.280
If you know who he is, let me know. I want to find his ass. He still owes me two bucks.

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:25.380
Mother fuck you.

01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:32.880
Fuck you to the people who are unemployed and can go to bed and stay asleep till two in the goddamn afternoon.

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:35.780
I envy all you guys, so fuck you.

01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:39.480
But I want to have a job, because I need money.

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:41.180
I'm not getting unemployment.

01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:42.780
Oh, that sucks.

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:47.280
I could, but I'm not, because my man makes enough to support us both, which is enough.

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:48.280
But...

01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:52.280
Hey, tell someone to hire me!

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:54.280
Alright.

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:56.780
Chat room is demanding we get to their FUs, so here we go.

01:10:56.780 --> 01:10:58.780
Fuck you!

01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:02.780
Fuck the chat room FUs for breaking up my fuck you.

01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:05.780
Oh, were you done? Did you have anything else you wanted to add?

01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:09.280
Fuck you to crazy ass women giving us double signals.

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:13.660
One minute they hot what bit if they cold you don't know what the fuck is going on

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:19.800
At 22

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.300
Exactly all right

01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:24.980
I got a fuck you to Sacramento because

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:30.480
Because I cannot find a pink anywhere when you need money you cannot find a pink anywhere on the road

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:32.480
Who do you think at Wells Fargo?

01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:38.140
Jesus go to any store go to this. There's a safe way up the street. They have their 24 hours. They have Wells Fargo

01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:45.140
Okay, based on my last fuck you about women, I'm sorry Susie, if you're listening somehow, I didn't mean it.

01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:12.140
poppin' into the chatroom right when Angel leaves, FU to not having a routine for Mt. Mikes

01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:14.140
er, Mt. Mikes, March Madness

01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:18.140
I keep thinking M.M. means Mt. Mikes

01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:31.140
FU to having two essays due tomorrow and not having started, oh my god what the fuck

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:38.140
DarkTartuya says, F U 2 being single still. Someone date me dammit!

01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:42.120
I think that's it. Are you a male or a female?

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:43.940
Male. Oh, never mind.

01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:48.680
Arkadian42 says, F U 2 my body for being in bad shape this week. I started out with a

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:54.160
sore throat, then developed into a cold, then went away, then came back. Also, my left foot

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:57.820
hurt at the beginning of the week, and then stopped hurting, and now my right foot hurts.

01:12:57.820 --> 01:13:01.480
It also kept me from getting anything accomplished this week, since I didn't want to go out at all.

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:08.320
Fuck you to tailgaters who can't see that you can't move up any farther in traffic. Fucking idiots.

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:10.720
That reminds me of a fuck you.

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.840
Fuck you, goddamn pneumonia.

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:18.480
Once you get rid of a cold, this motherfucker kicks in, and it doesn't go away.

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:21.940
Fuck you to bad Chinese immigration.

01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:31.940
FU2, or I'm sorry, a sub-discipline says he's angsty this week, so a big fat fuck you goes out to all the people at Fry's for not having metal pads when I really wanted them and had the money to buy them.

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:39.940
I call, they say they have them, I get there, and they're like, oh, you mean the metal ones? We don't have those anymore. So fuck them for being fucking retarded cousin humping cock gobblers.

01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:50.940
Also, fuck you to my current pads for sucking so much. I can't pass any Oni's on these fucking steaming piles of monkey do that have arrows scrawled on them. Fuck those, fuck those poo pads.

01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:55.340
I- that's cool.

01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:58.780
That's almost as cool as ass meat.

01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:03.580
No, you missed this one, fuck those poohpads.

01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:08.060
Also fuck my new shoes for not being dusty and frip and shite.

01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:11.300
I get like 47 grates on Metsuuri Japan yesterday and that's too many.

01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:15.320
I miss my old DCs because they weren't flaming pieces of lemur shit.

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:19.000
I could PA about as well as a mouse-finker now.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:25.000
It's okay. I'm gonna have more, so you have to promise to at least enter one of my upcoming ones.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:52.760
Fuck all the haircutters in my city for doing a lousy ass job every time I get a haircut.

01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:56.680
Fuck the mall for throwing you out for just carrying a skateboard.

01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:00.400
Fuck my dad for bitching about me doing stuff that I didn't do, plain and simple.

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:02.000
No, screw my dad one.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Oops.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Oops.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.460
Fuck the pop and music nonstop for making me get one good three times in a row.

01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:10.880
Fuck you for being that shitty.

01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:15.200
Justin Serkis says, F you to my mom for making me come home from Orange Lounge early.

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:16.520
F you to the troll lady too.

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:20.180
Oh, and f you to kids meals for not making me any less hungry at Boston Market

01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:23.780
F you to my Shenmue backpack for being small

01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:28.500
F you to the guy who is riding his bike in the middle of the road around the place to turn into scandia

01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:31.140
That guy was so stupid

01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:36.220
He was in the middle of Madison on a bike in the middle crossing traffic for no reason

01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:42.580
What a moron and that and he looked like a troll too. You should have gotten another kids meal. Maybe you would have felt better

01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:49.580
FU to AOL and I'll leave it at that. FU to dumb people, FU to stupid kids at CGL.

01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:58.460
Alright, I have a fuck you. Fuck you for all these kids. There are probably twelve to fifteen

01:15:58.460 --> 01:16:01.860
that are thinking that AOL is the only way you can connect to the internet.

01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:07.200
Big fuck you to all you kids who post comments saying fuck you to other kids when you're

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:09.300
a kid yourself.

01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:15.180
Fuck you to freaking AOL for ruining the whole theme to the Six Million Dollar Man.

01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:16.180
You suck.

01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:18.460
Their new commercial is the Six Million Dollar Man theme.

01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:19.460
They fucked it up.

01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:23.900
See, I don't watch TV, so I don't know these things.

01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:28.220
I still have AOL, but that's just because I don't want to get rid of my Doc's chocolate

01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:29.220
milk.

01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:37.380
I have the sentimental attachment I've had that theme for like nine years now.

01:16:37.380 --> 01:17:00.380
Fuck you to war if you can even call it that. It's more like an assault, saying it's how Iraq can't do shit. They've got like three anti-aircraft water balloons and a Nerf gun. Who cares? Saddam gasses his own people, all those people suck dick, so fuck them too.

01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:02.380
Yeah, fuck that shit.

01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:13.380
One thing about that, BBC.com has actually a really good breakdown of what the average quality of life is as far as what people make, how much things cost.

01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:16.380
They wear pink scarves, goddammit!

01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:24.380
I just kinda, I mean, I understand what they think the reasons are. My brother's actually in the Marines, over in Kuwait right now.

01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:28.380
Are you gonna trust the media that's ran by Tony Blair?

01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:33.380
Well, apart from that, though, I mean, you could go look anywhere and find the same stats.

01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:38.380
But, um, I find it very funny that the average doctor makes $45 a month.

01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:41.380
Whereas, how much does the average doctor make per month?

01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:45.380
They maybe make $45 a half hour.

01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:52.380
As for old Tony Blair, I really don't like him, but I do like the fact that he was right up there with this raid to go to war with this one.

01:17:52.380 --> 01:18:01.380
Uh, you know, Iraq doesn't really exist. It's just a giant pool for all the money, you know, that Bush is spending right now to go to the Area 51 and Alien Project things.

01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:05.380
Really, this whole war does not exist. It's a big, giant cover-up.

01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:09.380
You heard it here first!

01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:13.380
Yeah, I think he's trying to compensate for something.

01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:17.380
It's actually all taking place in a studio in New Mexico.

01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:21.380
Alright, I wanna give a fuck you out to France, Montreal and Quebec.

01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:25.580
First of all, yeah, it's not French fries anymore, it's American fries, and call everything

01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:26.580
Freedom Fries and American toast.

01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:27.580
Oh, you mean French fries aren't French?

01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:28.580
They're Belgian.

01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:29.580
They're from Belgium.

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:34.580
Okay, about France real quick, how can we say, fuck you, because they were going to

01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:37.580
just go against one of our security resolutions that we proposed.

01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:45.300
I mean, come on, the U.S. has vetoed over 24 U.S. resolutions that were going to reprimand

01:18:45.300 --> 01:18:49.580
Israel for what they've done to the Palestinians, and we get pissed off because of one veto.

01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:52.580
How about Calvin, uh, Quete de Merde?

01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:55.580
Head of shit.

01:18:56.580 --> 01:19:00.580
Speaking of head of state, that's gonna be a good movie.

01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:07.580
I'm getting so hot, I'm gonna be fine.

01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:17.780
I'm looking at a picture that Jazz posted in the chatroom, it's all greats on Happy

01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:19.780
Wedding in that queue.

01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:23.060
That'll get you a C, yeah, interesting.

01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:25.260
Alright, anyway, let's finish up the FUs.

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:27.060
Not done yet.

01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:31.260
Mannequin Ego Jazz says, F you to having no money because now I can't go to March Madness.

01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:35.020
Christ, man, you need to get up here somehow.

01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:42.020
And now I'm going to jump the bandwagon, F.U. to being single.

01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:47.260
I'm white, what do you expect, babe?

01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:51.300
That's it. Oh, I have to check the mailbag, but as far as I know that's it, so...

01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:56.080
Does DDRHolic have something?

01:19:56.080 --> 01:20:01.540
Once again, continuing F.U. to the DDR Extreme Roulette system.

01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:02.860
God dammit!

01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:09.860
Fucking A, every fucking time I do roulette, I get one away from Legend of Max, and you taunt me with your god damn shifting!

01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:16.860
It goes to Legend of Max, and it's like, HAH! You can't have that! You can have 2D Chaser Morning Mix instead, asshole!

01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:18.860
So, F you through the freaking roulette system.

01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:22.860
Alright, I could go on and on with fuck yous for the whole entire night.

01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:31.860
If anyone wants to hear the rest of my fuck yous, you can catch me on AIM under DarkChild999, that's C-H-Y-L-D-E-999,

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:43.380
or on Yahoo on dchild999, or on ICQ at 110960221. Or you can email me at darkchild999 at hotmail

01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:50.860
dchild999 at Yahoo, jwilson at wowedy.net, wilsonjason at acmsystems.com, and I could

01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:51.860
go on and on, but that's enough.

01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:59.720
I wonder if I should make a Bomani Player Singles page on my website. That would be

01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:05.720
I want to give a fuck you out to Singular Wireless for only having reception when your phone is off.

01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:12.720
I don't know why what you said just gave me flashbacks to that thing posted on DDR Freak that J-Dog posted.

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:14.720
The hi please date me thing.

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:16.720
J-Dog sucks.

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:22.720
Fuck you, J-Dog. Fuck you, Jason Ko.

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:26.720
Care to elaborate on that as long as we're going to be controversial here?

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:38.720
Fuck you for being a whiny little bitch because some people made fun of your little slide-slide-slide AM3P routine, made fun of it, had a good time, and you had a little hissy fit about it. Oh, poor baby.

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:42.720
Address those cards and letters to D.

01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:46.720
Alright. G-town, yeah, yeah. We already gave up.

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:53.720
Okay, so, I think we're finally done. Is everybody feeling a little less angsty now that we were able to get that off?

01:21:53.720 --> 01:21:56.720
I'm still angsty, I'm female!

01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:59.720
You didn't have any FUs, dear holly, do you have anything you want to say?

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:01.720
She's playing with the ferret.

01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:03.720
One more, this one's a big one.

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:08.720
Fuck you, U.S. Army, for still having me under obligation until August 23rd.

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:11.720
I pray this war doesn't go bad.

01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:13.720
Eek!

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:15.720
Alright, we're gonna take-

01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:20.720
We can put you on a boat in the cargo hold and send you to Taiwan.

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:26.720
We're going to take a quick break and we'll be back.

01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:28.720
And when we come back from the break.

01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:29.720
Cheer train.

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:30.720
What?

01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:31.720
Cheer train.

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:32.720
Oh, you want to cheer train this.

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:34.720
This is great.

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:35.720
Just for.

01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:37.720
We want dancer.

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:40.720
Dancer.

01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:41.720
Anything else?

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:42.720
Dancer and that's it?

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:43.720
Dancer and cheer train?

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:45.720
And...

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:47.720
Dude, play Paranoia Clean Mix.

01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:49.720
Alright, I'll see what I can dig up for you guys.

01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:50.720
Uh...

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:51.720
No, play old stuff.

01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:52.720
Some old stuff after dancer?

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:53.720
Yeah, old stuff.

01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:57.720
Alright, some old school stuff after dancer, and then we'll be back to talk about shit.

01:22:57.720 --> 01:22:59.720
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:36.720
Run out, I'm not fucking with you, I'm not fucking with you, I'm not fucking with you,

01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:09.720
Jojo, D.M.O. Rocka, the King. Jojo, D.M.O. Rocka.

01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:36.720
Roll the tape!

01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:01.720
Now

01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:10.720
Now

01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:13.720
Now

01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:16.720
Now

01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:19.720
Now

01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:21.720
What the hell?

01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:23.720
Let's go!

01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:28.720
Come on, come on, come on!

01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:30.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:35.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:42.720
Fuck you

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:44.720
And the sun is shining

01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:03.120
Jeff one, Jeff one

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:06.120
When I come down, I come down right to the sun

01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:08.720
And right down, you're right down the bend

01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:11.420
But I'm the loudest, who's my ghost in love?

01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:15.220
Tipped to the surface, got to the best, calm down, yeah

01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:18.720
Keep the head, nevertheless I'm the best of the best

01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:23.720
Get to the feelin', I'm stickin' the pose until nobody knows

01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:27.220
When I come, I'm runnin' from the ground to the head, no sound

01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:30.720
Yeah, get right down to a dip

01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:36.220
I said one, two, three, four, c'mon y'all, I get all this more

01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:41.220
Can't write down, look right down a chair I was round and round, stoop like a finger

01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:46.220
Come down, come down, sweet banana Get to the beaver

01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:49.220
I'm kickin' the floor, go to it right down a hill

01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:51.220
This is a ride when I kick it to the floor

01:28:51.220 --> 01:28:54.220
Come down, come down, sweet banana

01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:56.220
Never the less I'm impressed at the best

01:28:56.220 --> 01:28:58.220
Move it to two

01:29:28.220 --> 01:29:42.220
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:50.220
Hi, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:51.220
We're back.

01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:53.660
Looks like you got horse crack.

01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:54.660
More derby again?

01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:55.660
Yeah.

01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:58.940
And my voice is pretty.

01:29:58.940 --> 01:30:02.940
So there's all new Bamani CDs or Bamani-related CDs coming out, I thought we could talk about

01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:03.940
a few of them.

01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:07.020
Loki, you might know more about this than I do, but I mean, the chat room's kind of

01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:11.740
been talking about this guy on and off tonight, and I thought maybe we'd bring him up.

01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:12.740
The Koutimou guy?

01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:13.740
Yeah.

01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:18.740
Yeah, he's got a CD coming out.

01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:30.740
You can sync up your VBMS to the Catimo V. And it works! It works!

01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:37.740
It feels cool. The one that you were playing over last night had them doing butterfly, but you can hear the background music. I think that's how they do it.

01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:43.740
He just did at least 100 seconds and some other one, I forget, with some other song.

01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:44.740
Rob, you should play that.

01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:46.740
I tried to find them all.

01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:19.740
We have dead air space.

01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:24.740
Dead air space.

01:31:24.740 --> 01:31:29.740
We can't really find the continuous stuff right now.

01:31:29.740 --> 01:31:34.740
Maybe we'll look and see if we can get it later.

01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:39.740
What's new at the nice farmer's market?

01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:42.560
karaoke night

01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:45.560
you want to see you want to serenade us with some ddr karaoke

01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:47.800
sing for us in ddr

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:52.560
you want some background music i don't know if i know the words to anything

01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:53.060
oh

01:31:53.060 --> 01:31:56.740
aye aye aye and your little butterfly

01:31:56.740 --> 01:32:00.500
green black and blue paint like flowers in the sky

01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:03.780
aye aye aye

01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:08.040
and he just voiced the game

01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:31.600
Let's wait for D.W.I. to come out for that.

01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:34.900
innovation's turn. I remember we used to have some kind of really good butterfly

01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:40.440
rethink that we did for it. I don't think he remembers it though.

01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:51.960
Yeah, I can, I guess. I can't sing anything on a singer, though.

01:32:51.960 --> 01:33:00.960
I can see the star, cause I'm in the sky. Wherever you are, I'm gonna see you fry.

01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:03.960
That was perfect.

01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:05.960
Okay, if you want something Japanese?

01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:07.960
What?

01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:09.960
We have ferret mix.

01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:10.960
I'm gonna die.

01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:24.120
Sounds kind of like, when that parrot when it makes that like really like freaky sound,

01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:26.680
it's like, sounds kind of like corn-holio.

01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:28.480
See if I can get it.

01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:30.600
No, that's the sneeze.

01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:32.320
No, that's the sneeze.

01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:33.320
That's the sneeze.

01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:37.320
That freaky sound sounds kind of like Cornholio.

01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:41.320
Let's see if I can get it. No, that's the sneeze. No, that's not it either.

01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:45.320
I keep messing with this thing because it's not saying the right thing.

01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:49.320
No.

01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:53.320
There it is. Damn, Cornholio!

01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:57.320
Alright, am I playing this other Kootemu clip here that we wanted to hear?

01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:31.520

01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:40.460
so is it true this guy's got a CD coming out or what's the deal with this

01:35:40.460 --> 01:35:43.400
it's not really a CD he just makes

01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:46.800
supposed CDs but they're just a bunch of MP3's that he has

01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:50.580
uh... he's doing like a non-stop of his songs and he's doing

01:35:50.580 --> 01:35:54.180

01:35:54.180 --> 01:35:57.080
uh... if you could pull up our forums again

01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:59.080
We can check that because I actually wrote it down on there.

01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:00.080
Come on, come on.

01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:00.580

Does the TVWI contest, does that involve alcohol?

01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:43.280
For StepMania, we are having a contest where pick a TV song, not a remixed version, not

01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:52.320
a long version, just a TV theme song and make steps for it.

01:41:52.320 --> 01:42:01.480
We have one for Mr. Rogers, and it's kind of, uh, stupid.

01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:03.640
I personally want to see one for two stupid dogs.

01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:09.720
You've seen two stupid dogs, right?

01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:13.720
That shit was cool.

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:19.040
I want one for two stupid dogs, and for Freaky Soy.

01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:20.040
I made one for Funky Brewster.

01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:24.260
It's so slow to do it in double speed

01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:31.480
No, she's not she got her reduction

01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:39.540
She looked pretty hot in the in the pumpkinhead movies though

01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:41.360
Okay, first of all

01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:46.800
I want to know what you think is more attractive having really huge boobs and walking with a hunch or

01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:48.720
having

01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:52.000
Not as big boobs, but still big and walking upright

01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:58.040
Wait, this is where you think you're gonna get me but you're wrong. I didn't say big boobs at all

01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:03.920
I said she got boobs firm breasts are what's good firm breasts are the greatest

01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:10.020
I don't care if they have to be huge or what but firm firm breasts or what is awesome. Okay?

01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:13.340
If I'm allowed to touch them, it doesn't matter

01:43:13.340 --> 01:43:19.340
Loki, were you breastfed as a baby, or not?

01:43:19.340 --> 01:43:23.340
Wasn't practically everyone on the face of the earth, pretty much.

01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:24.340
No.

01:43:24.340 --> 01:43:26.340
We'll see, we know how you...

01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:27.340
Yeah.

01:43:27.340 --> 01:43:30.340
Are you an 80's child?

01:43:30.340 --> 01:43:33.340
I was, and my mom used cloth diapers.

01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:37.340
I was a natural child.

01:43:37.340 --> 01:43:38.340
I'm sorry...

01:43:38.340 --> 01:43:42.340
I was told I was breastfed, but I refused it.

01:43:42.340 --> 01:43:51.040
I'm sorry but my sister they tried to breastfeed her and she was allergic to

01:43:51.040 --> 01:44:01.440
natural milk so it would make her sick how does that suck like a baby like um

01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:06.340
basically when it comes to a girl I don't want knee slappers you know I want

01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:08.340
to sit where they're supposed to sit.

01:44:36.340 --> 01:44:38.100
down to your knees.

01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:41.780
I don't want you looking like some freaking huge freak with these giant breasts that look

01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:44.180
like god knows what.

01:44:44.180 --> 01:44:46.380
And I also don't want you looking like a little boy, so uh...

01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:47.380
No, Bellaboy!

01:44:47.380 --> 01:44:48.380
In J-Cups!

01:44:48.380 --> 01:44:54.460
No, no, the ones that are really scary, the ones that have like these gigantic breasts

01:44:54.460 --> 01:44:59.420
and they are firm, but they're so ungodly huge that it's freakish.

01:44:59.420 --> 01:45:00.420
That's weird.

01:45:00.420 --> 01:45:02.780
No, I think what's weird is when you have those chicks with like the super huge, I mean

01:45:02.780 --> 01:45:08.260
like double F triple F whatever and then they have the super tiny nipples like

01:45:08.260 --> 01:45:12.460
super tidy boy nipples that is scary no but like look you would say about like

01:45:12.460 --> 01:45:16.220
the whole firm and big thing you don't want them to look like that punching bag

01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:21.200
game at scandia you just want to walk up and just get like a full swig and just

01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:26.180
sock em or something and this my channel presents the brand new double o size bra

01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:30.740
but no it's weird though is like okay cuz I took these I took a picture with

01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:34.260
these two chicks when we went to the easy rider bike show and they're like

01:45:34.260 --> 01:45:37.580
some of the models anywhere they basically they for the pictures they sit

01:45:37.580 --> 01:45:41.700
in your lap which is really sweet but their breasts were like up against my

01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:47.060
chest it it's just like felt weird because it was like unnaturally firm it

01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:54.620
was like not rocks but like it's like dirt there these like um balls I've seen

01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:58.140
where they're kind of like you know those inflatable beach ball type things

01:45:58.140 --> 01:46:03.640
But they're like, they're a little bit firm, but it feels like an over-inflated beach ball.

01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:06.140
I think they need to have their sailing changed.

01:46:06.140 --> 01:46:07.140
Yeah.

01:46:07.140 --> 01:46:14.380
All right, what I think is incredibly stupid is there's these, and they're mostly novelty

01:46:14.380 --> 01:46:15.380
models, it's true.

01:46:15.380 --> 01:46:20.320
This was a lot back when I was still in high school watching Geraldo or something, one

01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:21.920
of those talk shows.

01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:27.340
And they had these women on there who had had their chest enlarged to G size and up.

01:46:27.340 --> 01:46:34.020
seriously each boob was like the size of a small country it was like the size of

01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:38.180
they could have dropped those boobs on Iraq not quite as big as quit I'm

01:46:38.180 --> 01:46:48.220
thinking more like like Dixon sign but they were you know you think they're

01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:53.060
They're going to need back braces when they're 50.

01:46:53.060 --> 01:46:57.060
What if they made their spine out of steel?

01:46:57.060 --> 01:47:03.300
If they had their spine out of steel, then maybe that might work.

01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:06.980
Usually I would be surprised that y'all could talk about for breasts for so long, but then

01:47:06.980 --> 01:47:10.220
I remember what show I'm on.

01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:16.140
Don't you have a fascination with boobs?

01:47:16.140 --> 01:47:24.420
are interesting. I wouldn't want them for myself. But yeah, boobs are funny. Boobs are

01:47:24.420 --> 01:47:33.100
the punchline to a good joke. Knock knock, who's there? Boobs! Sweet. On that note, why

01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:39.180
don't we get to this week's cage match? What do you guys think? I won last week. What's

01:47:39.180 --> 01:47:40.180
It's a cage match.

01:47:40.180 --> 01:47:41.180
We pick songs.

01:47:41.180 --> 01:47:42.180
I'm sorry, I'm a noob.

01:47:42.180 --> 01:47:43.180
Not me!

01:47:43.180 --> 01:47:44.180
I'm day off.

01:47:44.180 --> 01:47:57.540
Anyway, the cage match is where we each pick a song, and since we've been into it, one

01:47:57.540 --> 01:48:00.420
of us will have won last week, so our song remains over.

01:48:00.420 --> 01:48:04.280
So the other two people will bring in a new song, and chat room votes on what they think

01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:08.700
is the best song, but we go around and rate it, sort of, you know, American Idol style.

01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:17.940
You know, usually with our generous person here, the bipolar person here, and the super

01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:18.940
cynic.

01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:20.940
So, yeah, cynic, you.

01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:28.700
And then our chat room gets to vote, and we vote after all the songs we've played.

01:48:28.700 --> 01:48:32.180
And I'm special because I won last week, but they hated my song from the week before so

01:48:32.180 --> 01:48:35.140
we voted it off the island and I picked a new one.

01:48:35.140 --> 01:48:36.140
So...

01:48:36.140 --> 01:48:39.180
Alright, so we're getting to this week?

01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:40.580
Alright, real quick.

01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:41.580
Yes.

01:48:41.580 --> 01:48:46.260
Fuck you with obscure survivor references.

01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:51.780
So uh, like um, yeah I've got my track and everything, but I've got two, so do you guys

01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:54.820
want to hear a house track, or a trance track?

01:48:54.820 --> 01:48:56.860
A house track, or a trance?

01:48:56.860 --> 01:48:57.860
A trance.

01:48:57.860 --> 01:49:02.620
Do you want to let the chatroom decide, or do you want to let us decide?

01:49:02.620 --> 01:49:16.740
We have either a sort of disco-y, but really hardhouse track, or we've got opera trance.

01:49:16.740 --> 01:49:19.940
How about you use one this week and use the other one next week?

01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:20.940
Fine!

01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:21.940
Fine!

01:49:21.940 --> 01:49:22.940
Fine!

01:49:22.940 --> 01:49:23.940
We get opera trance.

01:49:23.940 --> 01:49:27.660
While Loki shows me where the opera trance song is, why don't you listen to a clip of

01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:31.240
last week's winner because we only play we only play a clip of the one that won

01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:35.400
last week because you're already hearing it on the station because it won so last

01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:42.060
week in the cage match Jamie brought to us a song by a group called beatbox and

01:49:42.060 --> 01:49:46.000
they do this trance cover of a song called what a wonderful world give it a

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:53.000
try

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Don't you watch the brightest, blessed days, the dark, sacred nights, and things in my face.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:37.000
What a wonderful world

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:02.860
It's the vocal club mix, it's actually a little bit different than the one that you might have seen

01:51:02.860 --> 01:51:08.860
Bamani Ruhler's edit for, it's more vocals in it, and it's Opera Trance featuring Emma Sheplin.

01:51:10.220 --> 01:51:13.740
Alright, enjoy, this is Loki's pick. The title one more time?

01:51:13.740 --> 01:51:14.820
Spente Lestalle.

01:51:14.820 --> 01:51:18.380
Spente Lestalle, or if you just want to vote for it, you can call it Opera Trance.

01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:22.380
But remember, you can't vote until we've played all three songs, so here's the opera trance song.

01:52:18.380 --> 01:52:20.380
When you're with me

01:52:25.380 --> 01:52:27.380
You are never there to see

01:52:31.380 --> 01:52:35.380
Even if you go

01:52:35.380 --> 01:52:49.380
La dónde, la dónde, la dónde dónde

01:53:35.380 --> 01:53:36.380
Hey!

01:53:36.380 --> 01:53:37.380
Hey!

01:53:37.380 --> 01:53:38.380
Hey!

01:53:38.380 --> 01:53:39.380
Hey!

01:54:39.380 --> 01:54:59.060
All right, that was Spente Listele from Opera Trance.

01:54:59.060 --> 01:55:01.900
And by the way, that song is also on Dance Mania 20.

01:55:01.900 --> 01:55:02.900
Did you know that?

01:55:02.900 --> 01:55:03.900
Yeah, it is.

01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:06.660
Anyway, yeah, it's kind of neat.

01:55:06.660 --> 01:55:08.540
So good night.

01:55:08.540 --> 01:55:11.540
Okay, so here we go. What do you guys think of that? Go around the room.

01:55:11.540 --> 01:55:14.540
It's cool and I liked it once it picked up. I'd give it an 8.

01:55:16.540 --> 01:55:20.540
I like it. I'd give it a 9. I like opera stuff like that.

01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:26.540
It reminds me of techno mafia music, so I'd give it a 10.

01:55:27.540 --> 01:55:31.540
I second that of techno mafia stuff. I'd give it a 10 as well.

01:55:32.540 --> 01:55:35.540
I was severely disappointed so much I gave it a 10.

01:55:35.540 --> 01:55:45.900
it was okay seven okay I have a little bit of backstory to my pick because I

01:55:45.900 --> 01:55:49.940
know I'm gonna get shit for this but I don't care because everybody tells me

01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:54.700
everybody tells me I never can pick a song that wins so I figure fine I'm

01:55:54.700 --> 01:55:59.340
gonna go over the deep end this week but I'm I decided that you know everybody

01:55:59.340 --> 01:56:01.780
says oh you gotta pick something from sci-fam that's how you're gonna win this

01:56:01.780 --> 01:56:05.980
He picked something from PsyFam, so I told, I asked JB,

01:56:05.980 --> 01:56:08.280
Oh, give me a song from PsyFam that's sure to win it, and he said,

01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:12.280
You know what, Rob? This song's very you, and I think you'll like it.

01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:14.380
So I'm gonna, uh, put this in the cage mess tonight.

01:56:15.180 --> 01:56:20.380
And this is DJ Speedo featuring Wildside, and Wildside is, uh, as you know,

01:56:20.380 --> 01:56:23.980
the group that did Irresistible Mint from DDR Extreme.

01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:29.680
And the song is called Assoneejay, but you might notice a different name.

01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:34.860
And I'm so gonna die, but I don't care so enjoy

02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:33.040
Baby, to baby, baby, you know I'mma be happy

02:00:36.020 --> 02:00:39.920
Baby, to baby, baby, you know I'mma be happy

02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:43.920
Oh, that song was pretty boofy, pretty boofy.

02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:48.920
Hey, hey, haha, let's give it a two.

02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:53.920
Wait, wait, wait, we got a little, oh, okay, we got a curling event.

02:01:53.920 --> 02:01:55.920
MoCap Curling!

02:01:55.920 --> 02:01:57.920
Hello, Cage Match song.

02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:03.920
Jason has got a vacuum cleaner head thing, and we got a little ball rolling.

02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:08.920
And Mike's throwing the ball, and Jason is vacuuming the floor ahead of the ball.

02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:15.920
Hello! Back to cage match, Loki!

02:02:16.180 --> 02:02:21.360
Okay, this song violated so many rules. Number one, being a ketchup song, it sucked ass.

02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:24.400
Number two, it's a speed mix, which really sucks ass.

02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:28.460
And number three, I'm mad at Syfan right now, so that also sucked ass.

02:02:28.460 --> 02:02:35.460
So I give this song a native of 100, but the Kirlin gets a 10.

02:02:35.860 --> 02:02:37.520
Alright, uh...

02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:41.720
I hate that song just because it sounds too much like Happy Hardcore to me

02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:44.040
and I can't stand little candy kids

02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:47.480
so I'm gonna give it a three

02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:52.080
because it had a decent beat to it, so three

02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:55.520
Asian innovation

02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:59.080
seeing that I left the room because the song sucks so much

02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:03.980
I'll give it a, out of a scale of one to ten, I'll give it a suck

02:03:03.980 --> 02:03:06.680
and uh... of course my pick

02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:11.320
uh... i thought it was wonderful is that correct

02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:14.520
that balances out the side of the rock all you can't take a joke all right

02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:17.120
uh... are a damn liar

02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:21.080
and jimmy gets a zero for hitting me in the nose with the ball

02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:24.800
i gave it it's not have to get a new those like share jesus i give that a ten

02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:25.800
all right

02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:29.400
well i thought you'd be happy that i didn't get in the nose of the forest

02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:31.100
review what you can pick tonight

02:03:31.100 --> 02:03:32.480
shall we

02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:36.360
the first one you can pick and i have to uh...

02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:39.840
I have to cue it up, because I accidentally got rid of the CD.

02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:41.600
All right, here's the first one you can vote for.

02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:42.520
Here's a clip.

02:03:42.520 --> 02:03:44.840
Beat Fox with What a Wonderful World, last week's winner.

02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:46.320
And now, the winner.

02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:46.820
The world.

02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:56.320
Second one you can vote for.

02:03:56.320 --> 02:03:59.680
This is Spente La Stelle, also known as Opera Trance.

02:03:59.680 --> 02:04:00.760
You can vote for that.

02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:14.360
Also, you can vote for DJ Speedo featuring Wildside with Asaregé, also known as the

02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:16.160
catch-up song.

02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:26.920
All right, you can vote for any one of those three.

02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:29.000
send your votes right now over

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.220
private message in the chat room to sky

02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:34.700
if you vote for that we will end and i will tally up those votes and let you

02:04:34.700 --> 02:04:38.460
know who wins a little later in the show and god damn i hope i win finally

02:04:38.460 --> 02:04:40.720
uh...

02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:43.720
i think there's a lot of people vote for me just cuz they feel sorry for me

02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:49.280
uh... and i think that i don't know we got a little and i don't feel sorry

02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:53.800
for robs keep in mind that i think that for that song you have to hear it

02:04:53.800 --> 02:04:59.920
for two weeks. That's right, because there's no show next week, so whatever wins tonight

02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:06.920
is two weeks. So choose wisely. God, I hope I win. Or we'll kill you. Alright. My ball.

02:05:10.240 --> 02:05:14.760
My ball. Moving on, any other topics you guys want to discuss? What was this curling thing

02:05:14.760 --> 02:05:20.120
you guys were doing with the vacuum? My ball. They're playing with their balls and sticks.

02:05:20.120 --> 02:05:24.640
Your song sucked so horribly, we had to entertain ourselves and everyone else who was suffering

02:05:24.640 --> 02:05:25.860
in this room.

02:05:25.860 --> 02:05:26.860
So we were curling.

02:05:26.860 --> 02:05:27.860
It's an Olympic sport.

02:05:27.860 --> 02:05:37.160
It doesn't get as much recognition as the other sports, but it's pretty hard because,

02:05:37.160 --> 02:05:41.780
I mean, you have to be really athletic to be a curler, especially in the Olympics, because

02:05:41.780 --> 02:05:44.240
you have this broom, right?

02:05:44.240 --> 02:05:48.620
And you kind of need to know how to skate, and then you also...

02:05:48.620 --> 02:05:50.900
They have the ice shoes on, but it's still hard.

02:05:50.900 --> 02:05:54.080
And you have to sweep the floor.

02:05:54.080 --> 02:05:55.820
You got to keep ahead of whatever things are called.

02:05:55.820 --> 02:06:00.740
You have to keep ahead of the mallet ball thingy hockey puck thing that they do.

02:06:00.740 --> 02:06:01.740
Yeah.

02:06:01.740 --> 02:06:02.740
And pretty much it's...

02:06:02.740 --> 02:06:04.300
It's like a big lead weight with a handle.

02:06:04.300 --> 02:06:05.300
Yeah.

02:06:05.300 --> 02:06:09.860
For all you curling fans out there, you have to, depending on how fast, you have to get

02:06:09.860 --> 02:06:11.300
this target at the end.

02:06:11.300 --> 02:06:15.620
I'm sweating my ass off and we just curled twice and it was only like 10 feet.

02:06:15.620 --> 02:06:16.620
Yeah.

02:06:16.620 --> 02:06:19.860
Basically, you have to use the broom to reduce or increase the friction.

02:06:19.860 --> 02:06:21.340
It's kind of weird, you know?

02:06:21.340 --> 02:06:22.100
Simple point.

02:06:22.100 --> 02:06:28.020
But yeah, the brooms are only if hockey was played with brooms.

02:06:28.020 --> 02:06:30.220
Man, the puck would go so much faster.

02:06:30.220 --> 02:06:31.220
Simple point.

02:06:31.220 --> 02:06:32.980
It's a Canadian sport.

02:06:32.980 --> 02:06:35.420
Well, just remember, look for me in Asian Innovation

02:06:35.420 --> 02:06:37.660
in the next Winter Olympics.

02:06:37.660 --> 02:06:40.820
We'll be trying to represent Sacramento and the Bay Area.

02:06:40.820 --> 02:06:45.340
Team Sacramento curling 2008 in Beijing when they have no ice.

02:06:45.340 --> 02:06:47.340
Let's go.

02:06:47.340 --> 02:06:53.340
You know, you missed a show a couple weeks ago, we were talking about different mocap games that they could make.

02:06:53.340 --> 02:06:55.340
MOCAP CURLY!

02:06:55.340 --> 02:06:57.340
Yes!

02:06:57.340 --> 02:07:01.340
We did a list list, which we'll hopefully get to a list list segment tonight, I don't know.

02:07:01.340 --> 02:07:05.340
Although I'm thinking, you know, instead of list lists, you know what we haven't done in a long time?

02:07:05.340 --> 02:07:09.340
Let's do a Maimani match game tonight, what do you guys think?

02:07:09.340 --> 02:07:12.340
Alright, you wanna do that? We'll do a Maimani match game tonight.

02:07:12.340 --> 02:07:14.340
I'm a noob, you'll have to explain again.

02:07:14.340 --> 02:07:18.340
I can explain it to you guys. I can do that.

02:07:18.340 --> 02:07:23.340
If I can find Matt's theme on my computer somewhere, I hope so.

02:07:23.340 --> 02:07:28.340
I could just come up with some porn themes off the top of my head.

02:07:28.340 --> 02:07:33.340
We'll end the show with Ask Orange Lounge. We'll do that later.

02:07:33.340 --> 02:07:36.340
So, but we'll get to that in a little bit.

02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:41.340
Because I have to have time to write up questions so we have to take a break before we go to that.

02:08:11.340 --> 02:08:12.900
to keep

02:08:12.900 --> 02:08:14.700
do you think it's going to be

02:08:14.700 --> 02:08:15.580
malibu's

02:08:15.580 --> 02:08:17.980
but what is that

02:08:17.980 --> 02:08:20.340
there's money now

02:08:20.340 --> 02:08:24.320
that would be such at whether or not it might seem to be the suck s but not the

02:08:24.320 --> 02:08:25.340
good news

02:08:25.340 --> 02:08:26.620
like baba hotep

02:08:26.620 --> 02:08:28.200

02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:32.200
fuck you asian beat boxes that can't do it right

02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:35.020
now if you go to be yourself some

02:08:35.020 --> 02:08:39.020
box rooms they're having but they have a request for some prompt you to move

02:08:39.020 --> 02:08:46.020
you want to see

02:08:46.660 --> 02:08:53.660
there

02:08:54.740 --> 02:09:00.340
or or or or or or or or or or or or

02:09:00.340 --> 02:09:02.500
home under your door

02:09:02.500 --> 02:09:03.620
uh...

02:09:03.620 --> 02:09:07.180
i think now would be a very good time to take a break if you have a sending your

02:09:07.180 --> 02:09:12.060
votes already. There's not that many votes. There's not that many votes in right now for

02:09:12.060 --> 02:09:21.780
Cage Match. There's not that many votes in right now for Cage Match, which is, you know

02:09:21.780 --> 02:09:30.080
what happens when nobody votes? The underdog wins. All right. When no one votes, we gang

02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:35.060
up on Robin, then we win. Okay, if the underdog wins, I put zero votes, zero points for that

02:09:35.060 --> 02:09:41.380
opera trance because it sucked ass and I give 10 to that crappy ass happy hardcore wannabe

02:09:41.380 --> 02:09:42.380
shit.

02:09:42.380 --> 02:09:46.540
Alright, so we'll be back after this quick break and we'll talk about some of the Monty

02:09:46.540 --> 02:09:48.540
match game and your cage match winner.

02:09:48.540 --> 02:09:55.540
We'll be back!

02:10:18.540 --> 02:10:23.540

02:10:28.540 --> 02:10:34.540
Guarantee that you'll be there When I wake up in the night

02:10:34.540 --> 02:10:40.540
Will you be my guiding light? I don't care how far I'll take a place

Welcome to Orange Lunch Radio, where love is orange!

02:18:09.540 --> 02:18:12.220
Shaving monkeys is always permitted.

02:18:12.220 --> 02:18:12.940
Just kidding.

02:18:12.940 --> 02:18:14.060
But...

02:18:14.060 --> 02:18:15.100
But, yes.

02:18:15.100 --> 02:18:17.180
Technical plans. Look who's on your face.

02:18:17.180 --> 02:18:22.180
You scare the monkey, you don't come in.

02:18:22.180 --> 02:18:26.180
No, no. I'll just bring Shermy.

02:18:26.180 --> 02:18:28.340
If Shermy doesn't like you, leave.

02:18:28.340 --> 02:18:33.020
For cheating, as always, I'm brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.

02:18:33.020 --> 02:18:35.680
Hello again.

02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:37.860
We're back. The monkeys sling poo.

02:18:37.860 --> 02:18:42.540
and uh... i bet you'd love to know who won the cage match

02:18:42.540 --> 02:18:46.700
well it was very close to you know it's funny we had a vote for oprah trance

02:18:46.700 --> 02:18:51.180
yeah i think that she's the

02:18:51.180 --> 02:18:55.340
i hate to say this but it did win by one

02:18:55.340 --> 02:18:57.420
votes

02:18:57.420 --> 02:18:59.380
by one

02:18:59.380 --> 02:19:04.140
stinking boats haha

02:19:04.140 --> 02:19:08.980
The chatroom conspired to go over trans wanted it.

02:19:08.980 --> 02:19:12.900
By one vote over the catch up song. I'm so mad.

02:19:12.900 --> 02:19:16.060
Damn you people.

02:19:16.060 --> 02:19:19.960
See they planned it out. They wanted you to make you think you were going to win.

02:19:19.960 --> 02:19:21.580
And then slide in that last vote.

02:19:21.580 --> 02:19:26.040
I know. You all got together. You're plotting against me I cried.

02:19:26.040 --> 02:19:28.060
The big fat pickle song.

02:19:28.060 --> 02:19:33.000
Someone make me a big fat pickle song.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:40.000
I'm a cute cover, I'm a cute cover, I'm a cute cover, I'm a cute cover, I'm a cute cover,

02:19:42.160 --> 02:19:45.360
We need some paper, we need some paper for this next segment, do we have some paper in

02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:50.360
here? Do we have paper? We need paper. Do you have sheets you can share with the rest

02:19:50.360 --> 02:19:54.920
of us? Paper, paper. Oh I have one, I have a page. Okay, somebody can use the back of

02:19:54.920 --> 02:20:01.920
this. Yes? I have a suggestion, because I've been noticing that this game is kind of flawed

02:20:01.920 --> 02:20:13.920
What we need to do is we need to get the answers from the contestants, but don't read them off and then get the answers from us first, then we get the contestants' answers.

02:20:13.920 --> 02:20:20.920
You know what I'm saying? Because in that way we're not influenced by their answers.

02:20:20.920 --> 02:20:25.920
What are you doing?

02:20:25.920 --> 02:20:32.360
Uh, yeah, I, I, sorry, there's somebody, uh, Darchild's using the, uh, air duster on his

02:20:32.360 --> 02:20:36.800
head. Um, seven people match me this time. We should, we should do it like how we did

02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:39.640
it with loaded crescents and just show each other how we wrote our answers.

02:20:39.640 --> 02:20:42.840
Um, I, I agree. We'll do, okay, we'll do that different this week and see how that works.

02:20:42.840 --> 02:20:47.720
We'll read the contestants' answers last. But, in order to get contestants, we have

02:20:47.720 --> 02:20:54.160
to get the, we have to have them answer a simple trivia question. Let's see, um.

02:20:54.160 --> 02:20:59.320
What do you think? What's a good trivia question for them to answer?

02:20:59.320 --> 02:21:01.640
The penis mightier.

02:21:01.640 --> 02:21:05.560
No, it's got to be something gettable. It's got to be something easy. It's got to be something stupid.

02:21:05.560 --> 02:21:10.360
What is the square of pi?

02:21:10.360 --> 02:21:16.040
What is the formula for a mole if you're in school? You should know this.

02:21:16.040 --> 02:21:20.920
I haven't been in school for a while.

02:21:20.920 --> 02:21:21.920
She said a bunch of stuff.

02:21:21.920 --> 02:21:22.920
How about this?

02:21:22.920 --> 02:21:23.920
What's 75 squared?

02:21:23.920 --> 02:21:24.920
What's 85 squared?

02:21:24.920 --> 02:21:25.920
Who is the artist?

02:21:25.920 --> 02:21:35.360
The only thing that I learned when I was in school is how to avoid people and what a mole

02:21:35.360 --> 02:21:36.360
is.

02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:40.920
Which, by the way, is 6.02 times 10 to the negative 23rd power.

02:21:40.920 --> 02:21:42.520
All right, how about this?

02:21:42.520 --> 02:21:43.520
We'll make it really easy.

02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:46.080
Well, Colgan's boot size was a 16 in 1985.

02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:48.160
No, I don't think so.

02:21:48.160 --> 02:21:49.160
Sorry.

02:21:49.160 --> 02:21:56.160
Okay, whoever is the first two people to tell me what the fifth digit of Pi is.

02:22:02.160 --> 02:22:07.160
Okay, the first two people who tell me, and you've got to send their own private message or it doesn't count, the fifth digit of Pi.

02:22:08.160 --> 02:22:12.160
Because that was a big topic on DDR Freak earlier this week, so.

02:22:13.160 --> 02:22:14.160
It's I, right?

02:22:14.160 --> 02:22:15.160
Okay, here we go, let's see.

02:22:15.160 --> 02:22:16.160
I.

02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:20.640
okay the fifth digit of pi

02:22:20.640 --> 02:22:25.280
I think the fifth digit of pi is pi

02:22:25.280 --> 02:22:28.040
it's the letter E P I E E E

02:22:28.040 --> 02:22:31.200
right? okay let's see

02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:35.000
the fifth digit of me is my pinky

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:38.360
alright here we go here we go let's see who got it we got our winners

02:22:38.360 --> 02:22:41.800
so we got three one four one

02:22:41.800 --> 02:22:45.320
five so it's five

02:22:45.320 --> 02:22:53.080
Jazz said, well, he did say five, but he said four first. Sorry. JB got it, so JB's in.

02:22:53.080 --> 02:23:00.360
He was next. And let's see. Well, it looks like we got 23rd Magus, so there you go.

02:23:00.360 --> 02:23:02.200
I thought you were counting from the end of pi.

02:23:02.200 --> 02:23:04.680
No, sorry, I was not counting from the end of pi. So there you go.

02:23:04.680 --> 02:23:11.720
It's the end of pi. That's why I said it so fast.

02:23:11.720 --> 02:23:16.720
Alright, here we go. We got our two contestants. We have JB and 23rd Magus. Alright, here we go.

02:23:16.720 --> 02:23:20.720
Oh, the way the match game works, because you guys, not everybody's been here before.

02:23:20.720 --> 02:23:24.720
We're going to read questions and they'll have a blank in them, and we have to fill in the blank.

02:23:24.720 --> 02:23:28.720
And if the contestants match what you say, then they get a point.

02:23:28.720 --> 02:23:34.720
And what does our fabulous winner tonight get? Now they're both local, so they can actually get a prize tonight.

02:23:34.720 --> 02:23:37.720
They get nothing. Absolutely nothing.

02:23:37.720 --> 02:23:42.720
You get a free magazine at March Madness.

02:23:42.720 --> 02:23:47.720
Ooh, a magazine for the winner. Okay, here we go.

02:23:47.720 --> 02:23:52.720

02:25:34.420 --> 02:25:37.340
I know you love me!

02:25:37.340 --> 02:25:42.440
And then of course me.

02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:45.220
Because I'm beautiful, dammit. Alright, let's get started.

02:25:45.220 --> 02:25:49.160
First question!

02:25:49.160 --> 02:25:51.520
Here we go.

02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:57.600
Mr. Mike Ngo, also known as Asian Innovation.

02:25:57.600 --> 02:25:59.480
And what do you know, he's here.

02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:03.740
He was already to practice, I'm sorry, he was already to participate in the 2DX

02:26:03.740 --> 02:26:05.280
tournament in Sacramento

02:26:05.280 --> 02:26:06.880
at March Madness.

02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:11.480
When he heard that he didn't like any of the qualifier songs, he got so angry

02:26:11.480 --> 02:26:18.060
that he ran over to Scandia and decided to blank.

02:26:18.060 --> 02:26:21.440
Mike was already to participate in the 2DX tournament in Sacramento, but when he

02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:25.680
he heard that he didn't like any of the qualifier songs, he got so angry that he ran over to

02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:48.680
Scandinavia and decided to blank. I have one contestant locked in. And we have both of

02:26:48.680 --> 02:26:55.680
the

02:27:03.860 --> 02:27:05.040
that's okay

02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:12.040
it's a very own personal reference you know

02:27:12.040 --> 02:27:19.040
Alright, you ready? Bang, Anita! You don't have to write no novel!

02:27:20.040 --> 02:27:25.600
Alright, here we go. Let's first, now we're doing a different this week, so we have the

02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:28.400
contestants locked in, let's see what the celebrities said.

02:27:28.400 --> 02:27:33.880
Jamie, Mike got so angry that he decided to go to Scandia and...

02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:39.080
Play prop cycle instead. Play prop cycle instead.

02:27:39.080 --> 02:27:42.720
Anita, Mike got so angry he decided to...

02:27:42.720 --> 02:27:44.920
Yodel at the top of his lungs.

02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:47.760
Yodel at the top of his lungs!

02:27:47.760 --> 02:27:52.040
Loki, got so mad he decided to...

02:27:52.040 --> 02:27:55.920
Start curling.

02:27:55.920 --> 02:27:58.240
Zero.

02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:02.960
He got so mad he mistakenly killed the Scandia kids instead of the RPGL kids.

02:28:02.960 --> 02:28:05.320
Darchau?

02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:12.320
I got so angry he decided to kill my mom.

02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:15.800
Mike got so angry he decided to

02:28:15.800 --> 02:28:19.920
Kill DJ Syndrome and make a fake song list.

02:28:19.920 --> 02:28:22.560
Kill DJ Syndrome and make a fake song list. Beautiful.

02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:29.560
I said Mike got so angry that he decided to go to Scandinavia and defecate on a child.

02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:41.120
Alright, let's see what the contestants said. JB said, roll on the ground. No, I'm sorry,

02:28:41.120 --> 02:28:48.840
that is not a match. 23 Magus said, hump the coin slot. He decided to run the Scandi and

02:28:48.840 --> 02:28:53.600
hump the coin slot. Wow, they actually had to get on the machine then. That's a good

02:28:53.600 --> 02:28:59.920
one. I like that one. Oh, can I change my answer to the quick one? No, you cannot change

02:28:59.920 --> 02:29:07.920
your answer. Alright. So, no points. That's okay. It's still a tie. Let's go to the next

02:29:07.920 --> 02:29:13.440
question. Question number two. Darkchild has been out of the Bamani scene a long time.

02:29:13.440 --> 02:29:18.720
He came back out of the darkness to see what was new in the scene, and he was surprised

02:29:18.720 --> 02:29:25.720
the thing that had changed most in the scene was blank.

02:29:48.720 --> 02:30:03.680
Wow, that sound of silence is like a deep thought.

02:30:03.680 --> 02:30:07.640
Okay read it again.

02:30:07.640 --> 02:30:10.240
Dark Child has been out of the Bamani scene a long time.

02:30:10.240 --> 02:30:14.180
He came back out of the darkness to see what was new in the scene and he was surprised

02:30:14.180 --> 02:30:21.180
that the thing that had changed most in the scene was blank.

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:30.280
Be very, very quiet. People are thinking. Is there all the celebrities about walked

02:30:30.280 --> 02:30:37.280
in? A couple still writing. I'm waiting on one contestant. Any day now.

02:30:37.280 --> 02:30:49.660
contestant any day now the thing that changed most in the scene was blank yes

02:30:49.660 --> 02:30:56.660

02:30:57.380 --> 02:31:07.380
come on contestants

02:31:07.380 --> 02:31:13.180
are all the celebrities done? Yes, all the celebrities done. We're waiting on a contestant

02:31:13.180 --> 02:31:18.180
I think we got it

02:31:18.180 --> 02:31:22.740
Beautiful. Jamie, your answer.

02:31:22.740 --> 02:31:25.900
The only thing that had changed was the stench. No one bothered to shower after

02:31:25.900 --> 02:31:30.260
still trying to PA paranoia.

02:31:30.260 --> 02:31:33.260
The stench.

02:31:33.260 --> 02:31:35.260
Alright.

02:31:35.260 --> 02:31:38.580
Anita, the thing that had changed most in the scene was...

02:31:38.580 --> 02:31:43.260
Was all the DDR players were now wearing one white glove.

02:31:43.260 --> 02:31:50.260
All the DDR players were now wearing one white glove.

02:31:50.260 --> 02:31:53.260
Loki, the thing that had changed most in the scene was?

02:31:53.260 --> 02:31:55.260
I gotta follow that.

02:31:55.260 --> 02:31:56.260
Yes.

02:31:56.260 --> 02:31:58.260
Um...

02:31:58.260 --> 02:32:01.260
I didn't really come up with anything funny, so...

02:32:01.260 --> 02:32:05.260
All the DDR players are little kids that are really stupid and should die.

02:32:05.260 --> 02:32:08.260
Okay, all the DDR players are little kids that are stupid and should die.

02:32:08.260 --> 02:32:10.260
Okay, zero.

02:32:10.260 --> 02:32:16.260
I couldn't come up with anything, so I figured the thing that changed the most was the child molesting gangbangers.

02:32:40.260 --> 02:33:09.940
I don't know if that counts, what do you guys think?

02:33:09.940 --> 02:33:11.620
Who said the RVGL thing?

02:33:11.620 --> 02:33:12.620
Somebody said something about RVGL.

02:33:12.620 --> 02:33:13.620
Was that zero?

02:33:13.620 --> 02:33:14.620
No.

02:33:14.620 --> 02:33:15.620
Okay.

02:33:15.620 --> 02:33:16.620
Sorry.

02:33:16.620 --> 02:33:17.620
Zero.

02:33:17.620 --> 02:33:18.620
Zero.

02:33:18.620 --> 02:33:19.620
None.

02:33:19.620 --> 02:33:20.620
Zip.

02:33:20.620 --> 02:33:21.620
Zip.

02:33:21.620 --> 02:33:22.620
Okay.

02:33:22.620 --> 02:33:23.620
It's still tied.

02:33:23.620 --> 02:33:24.620
Here we go.

02:33:24.620 --> 02:33:25.620
Next question.

02:33:25.620 --> 02:33:33.580
Jamie one day found herself on a deserted island with a shiny necklace on.

02:33:33.580 --> 02:33:37.660
She noticed that she was surrounded by children from Roseville Golf Land.

02:33:37.660 --> 02:33:54.500
The first thing she reached for was her blank.

02:33:54.500 --> 02:33:58.460
Jamie one day found herself on a deserted island with a shiny necklace on.

02:33:58.460 --> 02:34:01.500
She noticed that she was surrounded by children from Roseville Golf Land.

02:34:01.500 --> 02:34:05.080
The first thing she reached for was her blank.

02:34:05.080 --> 02:34:12.080
We have both our contestants in. How about the celebrities?

02:34:13.160 --> 02:34:20.160
Okay. Working on it. How you doing, Anita? About ready. Almost done. Anita doing another

02:34:23.480 --> 02:34:30.480
marathon answer. Okay. Alright, Jamie woke up on a deserted island

02:34:30.480 --> 02:34:35.400
Alright, Jamie woke up on a deserted island with a shiny necklace on.

02:34:35.400 --> 02:34:37.600
She noticed she was surrounded by children from Roseau Golf Land.

02:34:37.600 --> 02:34:40.200
The first thing she reached for was her blank.

02:34:40.200 --> 02:34:41.200
Ready?

02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:43.560
Jamie, what was the first thing Jamie reached for?

02:34:43.560 --> 02:34:44.560
Propel.

02:34:44.560 --> 02:34:46.920
RVGL children are easy targets.

02:34:46.920 --> 02:34:50.480
Alright, Anita, the first thing she reached for was her...

02:34:50.480 --> 02:34:55.120
Was her coconut nunchakus to open up a can of whoop-ass.

02:34:55.120 --> 02:34:57.120
Coconut nunchakus.

02:34:57.120 --> 02:34:59.120
Who's going to get that one?

02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:34.120
my own. Dude, I just ripped theirs off.

02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:43.160
Dark child. God, my mind is dirty. A jizz rack to wipe off that shiny necklace. I need

02:35:49.720 --> 02:35:56.000
to stay off the internet. Oh, my lord. Okay, Asian invasion.

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
The first thing she reached for was her...

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:01.000
Immediately after that, she reached for a crack pipe.

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:06.000
Jamie! You have a crack pipe?

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:11.000
Alright. I said the first thing she reached for was her fan!

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Remember the movie? The guy with the fan? Yeah, alright.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:21.000
Okay. JB said the first thing she reached for was check for a match.

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:22.000
The Fam was cool.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:26.000
We're going to check for a match.

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:29.000
JB said the first thing she reached for was her fork.

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:30.000
I almost said that.

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:35.000
I almost said fork, but then again, RBGL children have herpes.

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:42.000
23rd Magus said the first thing she reached for was her boom stick.

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:43.000
Good movie reference.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:44.000
Boom stick!

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:45.000
Very good movie reference.

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
Sam Raimi is God.

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:51.560
still tied up

02:36:51.560 --> 02:36:56.320
still tied up at nothing nothing or at least one of the one wins right

02:36:56.320 --> 02:36:58.920
low-key

02:36:58.920 --> 02:37:04.160
low-key was really excited to be moving into a new apartment very soon

02:37:04.160 --> 02:37:07.680

02:37:07.680 --> 02:37:14.680
what am i going to do about packing my massive collection of blank

02:37:14.680 --> 02:37:21.680
It doesn't have to be the obvious. Do whatever you want. You gotta want to match the contestants. Do say what the contestants would say.

02:37:21.680 --> 02:37:31.680
Loki was really excited to be moving into a new apartment very soon. A couple days before the move, though, he started to worry. What am I going to do about packing my massive collection of blank?

02:37:35.680 --> 02:37:37.680
I came up with an answer very quickly.

02:37:37.680 --> 02:37:46.640
Oh, we have one contestant locked in.

02:37:46.640 --> 02:37:50.000
I think that's both contestants.

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:54.120
All right, are all the celebrities ready?

02:37:54.120 --> 02:38:07.520
Okay, I'm almost ready, almost, okay, how do you spell, never mind, how do you spell

02:38:20.360 --> 02:38:24.120

02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:42.480
Zero. I said shit.

02:38:42.480 --> 02:38:46.560
Massive collection of shit, how nice, okay.

02:38:46.560 --> 02:38:48.840
Dark child.

02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:50.720
Real dolls.

02:38:50.720 --> 02:38:53.280
Real dolls. Oh!

02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:55.040
You know the...

02:38:55.040 --> 02:38:57.080
For those who don't know, um...

02:38:57.080 --> 02:39:01.560
they're really high-end, non-blow-up girlfriends. I mean, fully articulate, they

02:39:01.560 --> 02:39:02.920
look realistic.

02:39:02.920 --> 02:39:07.480
on real sex a guy's girlfriend. They had men ones too with like big cocks. I don't care

02:39:07.480 --> 02:39:10.800
about the men ones. And they said that they were working on the ones that actually came.

02:39:10.800 --> 02:39:17.800
ReelBell.com. I knew he was all excited. Okay, recent innovation is massive collection. Toenail

02:39:19.720 --> 02:39:26.720
clippings. Of toenail clippings. Aw, sorry, not a match. I said, Loki, what is he going

02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:29.960
what am I getting what is he going to do about packing his massive collection of

02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:32.800
cok rings

02:39:33.080 --> 02:39:41.600
cock rings Scott all right let's see what the contestants said let's see if

02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:44.980
we get a match 23rd Maggots says what is Loki going to do about packing his

02:39:44.980 --> 02:39:51.480
massive collection of porn JB says what is he going to do about packing his

02:39:51.480 --> 02:39:56.480
his massive collection of porn. Both contestants said porn, no match.

02:39:56.480 --> 02:40:00.480
It's funny that all the underage people think of porn.

02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:03.480
Shame on all of you perverts. We think of murder, right?

02:40:03.480 --> 02:40:07.480
Alright, last question. I don't have a massive collection of porn.

02:40:07.480 --> 02:40:10.480
It's way outweighed by the massive collection of dead babies.

02:40:10.480 --> 02:40:15.480
Last question, this is your chance to shine. Just to be fair, I was going to say porn,

02:40:15.480 --> 02:40:18.480
but I thought someone else in the group would have already taken it.

02:40:18.480 --> 02:40:25.480
Rob got made a lot of fun of for playing the catch-up song on Orange Lounge Radio. After

02:40:25.480 --> 02:40:31.480
Rob got made a lot of fun of for playing the catch-up song on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:40:31.480 --> 02:40:35.960
lounge radio. After the show was over, the room decided that his punishment should be

02:40:35.960 --> 02:40:42.960
blank. Alright, Rob got made a lot of fun of for playing the catch-up song on Orange

02:40:42.960 --> 02:41:02.120
Rob got made a lot of fun of for playing the catch-up song on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:41:02.120 --> 02:41:09.200
After the show was over, the room decided that this punishment should be blank.

02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:10.580
We have both our contestants locked in.

02:41:10.580 --> 02:41:20.140

Okay, here we go. Jamie, his punishment should be? To drink his weight in ketchup. To drink

02:41:25.140 --> 02:41:31.680
his weight in ketchup. That's a lot of ketchup. Anita. Oh, I didn't get quite as creative.

02:41:31.680 --> 02:41:38.680

02:41:40.060 --> 02:41:44.180

02:41:48.100 --> 02:41:49.260
minutes of that

02:41:49.260 --> 02:41:51.540
it's awful about five minutes for looking

02:41:51.540 --> 02:41:52.980
uh...

02:41:52.980 --> 02:41:54.220
it's it's like

02:41:54.220 --> 02:41:56.260
what do you mean i'm moving my best

02:41:56.260 --> 02:41:58.580
I mean, it's just like, who cares?

02:41:58.580 --> 02:42:02.540
It's so- why are you, like, sneaking into some person's house to rub your breasts?

02:42:02.540 --> 02:42:03.760
It makes no sense!

02:42:03.760 --> 02:42:05.440
I thought you liked breasts!

02:42:05.440 --> 02:42:07.840
Yeah, but it makes no sense when you're just standing there going,

02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:12.080
Oh, look at me, I'm standing here in the wind, exotic location,

02:42:12.080 --> 02:42:14.080
rubbing my breasts for no reason!

02:42:14.080 --> 02:42:17.900
Just standing there- she's not having sex, she's not, like, you know,

02:42:17.900 --> 02:42:18.700
sponsored by the algorithm.

02:42:18.700 --> 02:42:21.800
In and on or anything, she's just standing there saying,

02:42:21.800 --> 02:42:24.700
Look at me, I'm sexy looking!

02:42:24.700 --> 02:42:28.000
If you had the Playboy channel at my house, I'd end up turning it to CNN.

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:32.500
Dude, let's just put it this way. I get every single Playboy movie that comes out, and they all suck ass.

02:42:32.500 --> 02:42:37.500
They're all regurgitated clips from older Playboy movies, and it's just, it's awful. They try to think-

02:42:37.500 --> 02:42:40.200
Oh my God, are you out of gear?

02:42:40.200 --> 02:42:41.900
Girls Gone Boring.

02:42:41.900 --> 02:42:47.200
Okay, my answer was, punishment would be Rob would have to go straight.

02:42:47.200 --> 02:42:49.400
I almost said that.

02:42:49.400 --> 02:42:53.500
And by the way, they probably rub their breasts because it's cold on the beach. They gotta get warm.

02:42:53.500 --> 02:43:01.500
I don't understand how their nipples stick out all the time. How is that possible? Ice cubes? No, I don't want them.

02:43:01.500 --> 02:43:05.500
Alright, I'm done.

02:43:05.500 --> 02:43:07.500
I said...

02:43:07.500 --> 02:43:09.500
It's called airbrushing.

02:43:09.500 --> 02:43:16.500
I said at the end of the show Rob would have to fuck the ferret.

02:43:16.500 --> 02:43:17.500
How lovely.

02:43:17.500 --> 02:43:20.500
Dark child. Rob's punishment should be...

02:43:20.500 --> 02:43:23.180
Jesus Christ, I am a child of the internet.

02:43:23.180 --> 02:43:25.940
Go down on everyone in the room and swallow.

02:43:25.940 --> 02:43:27.220
Ah!

02:43:27.220 --> 02:43:29.980
That is punishment, Jesus.

02:43:29.980 --> 02:43:31.380
That's punishment for everybody.

02:43:41.380 --> 02:43:43.580
You get to sell popcorn, there'll be plenty of salt.

02:43:43.580 --> 02:43:45.340
All right.

02:43:45.340 --> 02:43:48.540
It's an invasion.

02:43:48.540 --> 02:43:50.620
porn is the funniest thing ever

02:43:50.620 --> 02:43:55.100
it's not exciting or anything it's just funny

02:43:55.100 --> 02:43:57.500
using innovation rob's punishment should be

02:43:57.500 --> 02:43:59.240
the catch-up song

02:43:59.240 --> 02:44:02.060
uh...

02:44:02.060 --> 02:44:03.720
good a good answer

02:44:03.720 --> 02:44:07.180
and uh... my answer would be that robs punishment should be to have sex with

02:44:07.180 --> 02:44:12.180
lots of hot people

02:44:12.180 --> 02:44:13.780
uh...

02:44:13.780 --> 02:44:15.620
uh... it sounds like treatment

02:44:15.620 --> 02:44:17.300
rob

02:44:17.300 --> 02:44:19.820
i think that

02:44:19.820 --> 02:44:22.740
who have leprosy

02:44:22.740 --> 02:44:27.380
rock and

02:44:27.380 --> 02:44:29.540
let's see if we actually got a match

02:44:29.540 --> 02:44:33.620
jb said robs punishment should be to be spent

02:44:33.620 --> 02:44:35.060
who

02:44:35.060 --> 02:44:37.300
that's that's a reward that

02:44:37.300 --> 02:44:38.980
twenty-third depends who by

02:44:38.980 --> 02:44:43.860
i mean if we're talking like you know

02:44:43.860 --> 02:44:45.700
uh... twenty-third bag is said

02:44:45.700 --> 02:44:49.820
his punishment should be to be beaten with orange bats nobody said go straight

02:44:49.820 --> 02:44:51.620
you guys cannot have said

02:44:51.620 --> 02:44:52.620
go straight

02:44:52.620 --> 02:44:56.940
that was the most obvious answer

02:44:56.940 --> 02:44:58.340
i don't know

02:44:58.340 --> 02:45:03.340
you tell me

02:45:03.340 --> 02:45:06.340
Okay, cause boys are stupid anyway. Except for the company.

02:45:08.340 --> 02:45:09.340
On that note...

02:45:09.340 --> 02:45:11.340
So, we have our big finish.

02:45:11.340 --> 02:45:14.340
The big scores, here they are, let's total it up.

02:45:15.340 --> 02:45:18.340
JB has a score of zero!

02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:21.340
And 23Magus has a score of zero!

02:45:21.340 --> 02:45:23.340
You win nothing!

02:45:23.340 --> 02:45:26.340
Nothing at all! Good day, sir!

02:45:26.340 --> 02:45:29.340
Wow, you couldn't even get a magazine, that's pretty fair.

02:45:29.340 --> 02:45:30.340
So, this is what happens.

02:45:30.340 --> 02:45:34.940
As punishment, you two get all of the punishments that were mentioned earlier.

02:45:34.940 --> 02:45:36.340
So there you go.

02:45:36.340 --> 02:45:37.340
Live at March Madness.

02:45:37.340 --> 02:45:42.620
So they get to be spanked, anally raped, and then get hot people.

02:45:42.620 --> 02:45:44.860
And then go down on all of us.

02:45:44.860 --> 02:45:45.860
They're underage!

02:45:45.860 --> 02:45:52.980
Hey, but remember, one of your punishments was, uh, hey Rob, one of the punishments,

02:45:52.980 --> 02:45:57.300
though, is get to have sex with a bunch of hot people.

02:45:57.300 --> 02:45:58.300
That's true!

02:45:58.300 --> 02:46:04.240
for that one. That's very true. Yeah, but I'll take the game back for the ferret. No,

02:46:04.240 --> 02:46:10.640
it ain't happening. Alright, so they're demanding a tiebreaker, but you know what, we don't

02:46:10.640 --> 02:46:12.720

Oops. No, we're not doing match game anymore. I have to queue up the other music.

02:48:52.560 --> 02:48:57.940
So this is a little segment we do when we need some time filler because our chat room

02:48:57.940 --> 02:49:02.700
is very creative so we allow them to ask Orange Lounge.

02:49:02.700 --> 02:49:05.940
So here we go.

02:49:05.940 --> 02:49:07.260
Shows ten minutes longer.

02:49:07.260 --> 02:49:08.260
Yes.

02:49:08.260 --> 02:49:09.260
Alright.

02:49:09.260 --> 02:49:10.260
Ask us questions.

02:49:10.260 --> 02:49:12.720
Here we go.

02:49:12.720 --> 02:49:18.060
Ask Orange Lounge or tonight you can ask Jart Child or Asian Innovation.

02:49:18.060 --> 02:49:22.420

02:49:36.360 --> 02:49:41.720
uh... it's a guy

02:49:41.720 --> 02:49:43.220

02:49:43.220 --> 02:49:45.340
we'll consider it

02:49:45.340 --> 02:49:50.820
We have to see. Keep in mind that one of us is unemployed.

02:49:50.820 --> 02:49:56.140
If you could out-treat me on Bacardi 151, I will sponsor you.

02:49:56.140 --> 02:49:59.740
I'll pay your way in. Come to think of it, I think it would be worth it to see his

02:49:59.740 --> 02:50:03.460
freestyle.

02:50:03.460 --> 02:50:07.420
I'll do it. Yeah, one of us will do it. We'll figure it out. But you need to try and come up with the money

02:50:07.420 --> 02:50:10.020
yourself, because if we have to sponsor you, we're making you do something

02:50:10.020 --> 02:50:14.340
humiliating.

02:50:14.340 --> 02:50:16.700
okay

02:51:48.060 --> 02:51:49.860
comfort of the original

02:51:54.460 --> 02:51:56.740

02:52:08.580 --> 02:52:12.500
We have two questions.

02:52:12.500 --> 02:52:16.300
How much weight did you put on from yesterday's party?

02:52:16.300 --> 02:52:18.620
I only had two ribs.

02:52:18.620 --> 02:52:21.220
But, yeah.

02:52:21.220 --> 02:52:26.700
And then, how is that horrible, wonderful job at Jack in the Box?

02:52:26.700 --> 02:52:32.420
I don't know, I give most of the food to you.

02:52:32.420 --> 02:52:33.300
Beautiful.

02:52:33.300 --> 02:52:37.380
And that's all the questions I've gotten so far for Ask Orange Lounge, so we'll

02:52:37.380 --> 02:52:39.380
We'll give him a couple more minutes.

02:52:39.380 --> 02:52:44.380
You're not funny, Mike. Quit laughing.

02:52:44.380 --> 02:52:49.380
Does anybody have a question for someone else here in the room?

02:52:49.380 --> 02:52:52.380
Will someone hire me? Please?

02:52:52.380 --> 02:52:53.380
I got a job.

02:52:53.380 --> 02:52:55.380
What are your job qualifications?

02:52:55.380 --> 02:53:03.380
Well, my resume is on Rob's computer.

02:53:03.380 --> 02:53:05.380
Oh my God, I love this porn!

02:53:05.380 --> 02:53:07.380
Is that resume in MPEG or TwitchCon?

02:53:07.380 --> 02:53:09.380
Okay, Rob, you said watch Ally McFeel with me.

02:53:09.380 --> 02:53:11.380
Oh my God, you are gay.

02:53:14.380 --> 02:53:16.380
That was the funniest porn ever.

02:53:16.380 --> 02:53:19.380
Ally McFeel had fucking Ron Jeremy in it, it was awesome.

02:53:20.380 --> 02:53:21.380
Sweet.

02:53:21.380 --> 02:53:22.380
God, Jeremy is a god.

02:53:22.380 --> 02:53:24.380
He can't suck his own penis anymore.

02:53:24.380 --> 02:53:26.380
Have you seen Pornstar, The Legend of Ron Jeremy?

02:53:26.380 --> 02:53:27.380
No, I have not.

02:53:27.380 --> 02:53:28.380
It's a sweet movie.

02:53:28.380 --> 02:53:29.380
Ran it.

02:53:29.380 --> 02:53:30.380
Is it porn?

02:53:30.380 --> 02:53:36.380
It's not actually porn, but I mean, they have like little clips and things, but it's still kind of, it's NC-17, but not really porn.

02:53:36.380 --> 02:53:40.380
What's this word, rent? I don't understand this word, rent.

02:53:40.380 --> 02:53:41.380
Rent.

02:53:41.380 --> 02:53:46.380
I have kazah, what's rent? Is that when I delete it after I watch it?

02:53:46.380 --> 02:53:51.380
Yes, yes, that's when you, you only have 24 hours after downloading this.

02:53:51.380 --> 02:53:54.380

02:54:49.920 --> 02:54:52.080
did not play one of those the other night

02:54:52.080 --> 02:54:54.160
your party I think I do have all these already

02:54:54.160 --> 02:54:57.500
I think I played one of them, they're alright

02:54:57.500 --> 02:55:02.080
I think Squaresoft rocks, I'll go to that page

02:55:02.080 --> 02:55:04.580
but that's not Orange when I'm talking, that's just me

02:55:04.580 --> 02:55:11.580
DDR Mike by the way says her her shut up squinty eyed Asian hoe

02:55:14.240 --> 02:55:17.700
why did he call you a hoe?

02:55:17.700 --> 02:55:20.080
I'll be over at your house tonight at eleven

02:55:20.080 --> 02:55:21.880
ba dum bum

02:55:21.880 --> 02:55:28.880
Alright, the other hoe, DarkTetsuyu wants to know, how come more females don't come in the chat room? Cry.

02:55:28.880 --> 02:55:32.880
That's because there's no one there who excites them enough.

02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:34.880
They're too busy cooking.

02:55:34.880 --> 02:55:39.880
Are there females coming in the chat room right now?

02:55:39.880 --> 02:55:44.880
First of all, they don't come in the chat room because it'll make a big stinky mess.

02:55:44.880 --> 02:55:46.880
Yeah, they don't come because you haven't found G-Spot.

02:55:46.880 --> 02:55:48.880
It's because I haven't been here yet.

02:55:48.880 --> 02:55:52.880
Because I can't come when you fuck me.

02:55:52.880 --> 02:55:56.880
Yeah, if a girl was coming, she wouldn't be in the chat room.

02:55:56.880 --> 02:56:00.880
Alright. Last one.

02:56:00.880 --> 02:56:04.880
Last one. Here we go. Last question from Justin Circuit.

02:56:04.880 --> 02:56:08.880
Can you give me money?

02:56:08.880 --> 02:56:12.880
Depends on what you'll do for me. I'll give you a dollar.

02:56:12.880 --> 02:56:16.880
Can you give me stuff? Can you give me head?

02:56:16.880 --> 02:56:20.880
I'll close my eyes.

02:56:20.880 --> 02:56:24.880
Alright.

02:56:24.880 --> 02:56:28.880
I'll give him money from Argentina.

02:56:28.880 --> 02:56:32.880
Okay, so, on that note, that's the end of Ask Orange Lounge. Alright, one more, there's one more, there's one more.

02:56:32.880 --> 02:56:36.880
One more, this is the last question, this is a good one to end it on, because it kind of relates to March Madness.

02:56:36.880 --> 02:56:40.880
SkylineDC505 wants to know,

02:56:40.880 --> 02:56:44.880
would doing bag 5-speed for the qualifier be noobish?

02:56:44.880 --> 02:56:50.880
Go ahead, I don't care. Just do it on one speed later on. Have fun.

02:56:50.880 --> 02:56:56.880
Okay, and now's that time of the show where we have to wrap it up.

02:56:56.880 --> 02:56:59.880
But first, we go around the room and get everyone's final thoughts.

02:56:59.880 --> 02:57:02.880
Rob, can we wrap it up in ribbon and bows?

02:57:02.880 --> 02:57:04.880
And confetti.

02:57:04.880 --> 02:57:05.880
And leather.

02:57:05.880 --> 02:57:08.880
And chains. And whips.

02:57:08.880 --> 02:57:11.880
Okay, now I'm getting into this.

02:57:11.880 --> 02:57:18.080
And, and, like, playing hot pokers.

02:57:18.080 --> 02:57:21.560
I don't have much to say, how about, pika-choo!

02:57:21.560 --> 02:57:29.740
All I gotta say is, unfortunately, there will not be an update to my site tonight or tomorrow

02:57:29.740 --> 02:57:33.320
because I have a headache and I'll probably be going to sleep.

02:57:33.320 --> 02:57:35.320
So maybe Tuesday.

02:57:35.320 --> 02:57:36.760
What?

02:57:36.760 --> 02:58:01.760
I accept this award on the behalf of myself, because you all suck. And one last thing,

02:58:01.760 --> 02:58:12.400
are cool. You're so cute. You're the coolest girl in the world. I declare war on Iraq because

02:58:12.400 --> 02:58:21.460
I'm a Texan. Bang, bang, bang. I'm a Texan. Bang, bang. April 15th, go buy your Miyazaki

02:58:21.460 --> 02:58:26.320
films Castle in the Sky, Spirited Away, and Kiki's Delivery Service come out on DVD in

02:58:26.320 --> 02:58:33.060
And April 19th is my birthday, so give me stuff.

02:58:33.060 --> 02:58:34.060
Your final thought, Mike?

02:58:34.060 --> 02:58:35.060
Go to March Madness, please.

02:58:35.060 --> 02:58:37.180
I don't want to turn out like five people.

02:58:37.180 --> 02:58:38.180
All right, thanks.

02:58:38.180 --> 02:58:39.180
Bye.

02:58:39.180 --> 02:58:42.180
My final thought is Zelda comes out tomorrow.

02:58:42.180 --> 02:58:44.940
Is anyone moist?

02:58:44.940 --> 02:58:47.220
Has anyone already played it?

02:58:47.220 --> 02:58:50.200
All right.

02:58:50.200 --> 02:58:51.200
That's it.

02:58:51.200 --> 02:58:52.200
End of show.

02:58:52.200 --> 02:58:58.020
NO SHOW NEXT WEEK BECAUSE WE'RE LIVE ALL DAY LONG SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.

02:58:58.020 --> 02:58:59.020
LISTEN FOR GOD'S SAKE.

02:58:59.020 --> 02:59:00.020
Or at least come to the tournament.

02:59:00.020 --> 02:59:01.020
As if COVID lessons will never do it again.

02:59:01.020 --> 02:59:02.020
Just kidding.

02:59:02.020 --> 02:59:03.020
We're already planning on doing it at V3 as well.

02:59:03.020 --> 02:59:04.020
But not after that.

02:59:04.020 --> 02:59:05.020
Alright.

02:59:05.020 --> 02:59:06.020
Thank you very much for listening.

02:59:06.020 --> 02:59:11.280
It's Corey from RTSRADIO.

02:59:11.280 --> 02:59:12.280
We love you.

02:59:12.280 --> 02:59:14.780
The system is down.

02:59:14.780 --> 02:59:18.180

And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

02:59:38.180 --> 02:59:41.180
Go, go, Power Rangers!

02:59:41.180 --> 02:59:44.180
Hey, dudes! Hey, you just changed! Yeah, I know, we always change characters every day.

02:59:44.180 --> 02:59:46.180
Hey, I'm a little kid and I'm going to join the Power Rangers. How do you know about us?

02:59:46.180 --> 02:59:48.180
How can I watch the show every day? Oh, OK.

02:59:48.180 --> 02:59:50.180
Hey, guys, look, it's those three teenagers that...

02:59:50.180 --> 02:59:52.180
Exactly match the Power Rangers personalities and their voices and every single thing about them.

02:59:52.180 --> 02:59:53.180
Let's go harass them.

02:59:53.180 --> 02:59:54.180
Oh, OK, well, come on.

02:59:54.180 --> 02:59:55.180
OK, go.

02:59:55.180 --> 02:59:56.180
Hey, we don't train that, just...

02:59:56.180 --> 02:59:57.180
Come on, you know...

02:59:58.180 --> 03:00:00.180
Yay, you're not supposed to get on board with that!

03:00:02.180 --> 03:00:03.180
Rangers, Rangers, what?

03:00:04.180 --> 03:00:05.180
What do you know?

03:00:06.180 --> 03:00:07.180
Five teenagers without a tube.

03:00:07.180 --> 03:00:08.180
What's wrong? What's going on?

03:00:08.180 --> 03:00:10.180
There's a bunch of disturbances going on.

03:00:10.180 --> 03:00:11.180
Oh, really? You'd better check it out.

03:00:11.180 --> 03:00:12.180
Ah!

03:00:12.180 --> 03:00:13.180
Ah!

03:00:13.180 --> 03:00:14.180
Oh, no, it's a monster! The terrorizing city!

03:00:14.180 --> 03:00:15.180
Rawr! What are you doing here?

03:00:15.180 --> 03:00:17.180
I'm the last of the world to have a giant pig!

03:00:17.180 --> 03:00:18.180
Oh, I eat stuff!

03:00:18.180 --> 03:00:19.180
Oh no, we need to destroy him!

03:00:19.180 --> 03:00:20.180
Snap it on!

03:00:20.180 --> 03:00:21.180
Give it back!

03:00:21.180 --> 03:00:22.180
I'm trying to save the dragon!

03:00:22.180 --> 03:00:23.180
Destroy the sword!

03:00:23.180 --> 03:00:24.180
Posing!

03:00:24.180 --> 03:00:25.180
Moving around!

03:00:25.180 --> 03:00:26.180
We are the Avengers!

03:00:26.180 --> 03:00:27.180
And we are going...

03:00:27.180 --> 03:00:28.180
Oh yeah?

03:00:28.180 --> 03:00:29.180
Well, uh, yeah, well.

03:00:29.180 --> 03:00:31.180
You weren't smart enough to call upon your megazords now.

03:00:31.180 --> 03:00:33.180
We're not supposed to grow!

03:00:33.180 --> 03:00:34.180
What the heck grew?

03:00:34.180 --> 03:00:36.180
Oh no, we need to call upon the megazord!

03:00:36.180 --> 03:00:37.180
Fusion!

03:00:38.180 --> 03:00:39.180
Megazord!

03:00:39.180 --> 03:00:40.180
We can't beat him!

03:00:40.180 --> 03:00:41.180
Sword!

03:00:42.180 --> 03:00:43.180
We need a leg!

03:00:43.180 --> 03:00:57.940
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
