26065	28787	Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

33030	33451	Just kidding.
33631	35232	Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.
35452	42898	In this episode... Hey, is there any balls down there?
43058	45660	That's the biggest bear you've ever seen, Jingleberry.
45740	47442	What's your favorite scary movie?
48928	49488	Showgirls.
50389	51550	Absolutely frightening.
51810	52611	What's yours?
52631	55093	There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.
55153	57034	Don't torture yourself.
57054	57855	That's my job.
58055	59796	Now's the time when Sprockets made me dogs!
59876	62939	I'll get you, my pretty.
63179	64520	And your little dog, too.
64920	65801	I know Kung Fu.
66181	68583	I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
68843	70685	Why did they have to take the word gay?
72326	74908	Nobody expects us to punish acquisitions.
75248	76089	It's handover.
78922	80722	DarkSakura Shut up!
80902	81603	Where's my gun?
81723	83683	This is my boom stick!
84163	86684	Sky Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!
86944	90685	Loki I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.
90745	93565	What kind of warping being would find that funny?
93805	102107	Orange Lounge Radio We are live and this is episode number 36 for March 9th of 2003.
105006	107147	We're live from La Casa de Jamie tonight!
107427	110889	So with me... Fuck my mixer, it won't let me play Waves in the background.
111349	113370	Well, with me, of course, she needs no introduction.
113410	115411	Say hello to DarkSakura, also known as Jamie.
115971	116892	Welcome to my house.
117652	118592	Welcome to hell.
118612	120253	Get the fuck out my house, bitch!
121874	124775	And joining us as usual, say hello to the Tech Master, Loki!
126176	126656	Tech Master?
126676	127837	I think I need to change the title.
128877	129298	Like what?
129538	134060	Welcome, everybody, say hello to the show's bitch, Loki!
135188	135608	Hey, bitch!
137008	138509	I thought that was someone else.
139029	139669	Yeah, where's our intern?
139729	142069	Everybody say hello to the asshole, Loki!
143430	143830	That'll do.
145090	146290	How are you today, asshole Loki?
147891	148451	I'm fine.
149971	152111	And joining us, of course, our intern, say hello to Zero.
153012	155352	I am not Orange Launch's bitch.
157333	158093	No, you just give head.
158213	158353	No.
159053	159813	Like interns do.
161973	162294	Never mind.
162314	164214	I was going to be mean, but never mind.
165151	165671	Be mean!
165731	167152	Come on, this is Orange Lounge, you can be mean.
168153	168933	Oh, fine.
170634	173656	Also joining us in studio, say hello to DarkTetsuya.
173876	174757	Yeah, hey.
175137	175757	How are you doing?
175817	176498	How are you, gentlemen?
177218	177498	Okay.
177999	178619	How's your week been?
179039	181541	Oh, just waiting on my FUs.
182381	188725	Wait a minute, it's been about, well, I don't know, probably about 25 weeks since we've had you on the show, so how's the past, like, four months been?
189826	191587	Oh, well, long story.
191947	193048	Okay, fair enough.
193708	194529	Also with us...
198217	199438	25 weeks on the show.
199738	202939	I think that's about, I don't know, six months?
205639	206480	I can do math.
208740	210441	This is what happens when you drop out of college.
210481	211021	Stay in school.
211081	211381	Be cool.
211641	211901	All right.
212281	214902	And also with us tonight, say hello to Sunya Bunya.
215222	215622	Hi.
216242	216582	How are you?
216602	217623	I'm okay.
217683	218543	Did I pronounce that okay?
220200	221361	Soonja, Soonja Boonja.
222001	224122	I wanted to make it rhyme with Boonya, so I said Soonja.
226302	229664	And Bombay, I called him by his nickname tonight so he wouldn't cut me.
229884	230704	Good job.
230984	231404	How are you?
231544	232165	I appreciate it.
232325	233385	I'm doing okay.
233405	236266	I'm a little tired from Scandia, but other than that, I'm pretty good.
237047	238287	I see you're wearing your uniform.
238447	240808	Yes, I just got off about two hours ago.
241188	243269	Very nice.
243789	244730	Jamie said you got off.
245110	247711	Also with us, say hello to Puppy.
247871	248091	Woof.
249207	249547	How are you?
249748	251169	You just came from downstairs.
251189	252090	You were playing Animal Crack.
252290	252530	Yes.
252750	253391	Killing roaches.
253411	254732	Because you haven't played in about a month.
254752	255873	There's like tons of them.
256794	258936	I know, but there's like tons of them.
259256	260297	I killed 20 so far.
261057	264480	The last time you played Animal Crossing was when Joe was on this show last, I think.
264500	267323	No, it was like a month ago.
267583	269084	Did you like what I did with your house?
269545	272768	I gave you matching floor and wall and some furniture that went with that set.
272868	273708	It's the Kadana set.
275316	276757	It's like trading spaces.
278178	279279	Anybody ever watch that shit?
280199	281200	My mom watches that.
283982	286924	They have the best of season one of that stupid show on DVD now.
287424	287824	Sad.
289465	291206	I'm waiting for the Gay Weddings DVD.
291326	292207	That shows the shit.
292747	293108	What?
295209	296109	We're giving a shout-out.
296129	296550	Shout-out.
297630	298951	Do shout-outs, Jamie.
299392	299792	Yo!
300392	302974	All you people who want shout-outs, yo, I'm just not gonna name anybody.
304175	304375	Yo.
305655	306175	What's up?
306536	307176	Okay.
308417	309318	Hello to our chat room.
309358	313321	If you want to join our chat room, go to orangelounge.skie.cx and click on chat.
313501	317884	And then you should also post in our forums, because our forums have been kind of dead, and we need people to post in them.
318105	320046	Not in the quote forum, my God.
320106	321167	No, not the quote forum.
321327	322648	Whoa, but everything else has been dead.
322908	325490	So we need people to go there and post love letters, if you wouldn't mind.
325811	327992	I need a lot of attention, and so does Jamie.
328032	332055	Jamie likes attention, so go post your love and affection letters to Jamie.
332075	334297	And then Loki, tell him what a dick he is.
334918	335198	Jerk.
337054	341959	Tell him you don't appreciate those racial slurs and homophobic comments, and what else has he said on this show, Nox?
341979	343501	Yeah, you porn monger, you.
344341	344922	The hell?
345062	351068	I'm like totally opposite from everyone perceiving me as, like some crazy racist guy out there.
351388	355052	I should just like shave my head, join the Ku Klux Klan and shit, man.
356293	357254	I don't know what the problem is.
359577	360718	You were saying, Loki?
362131	364393	All I have to say is you should have been there last night.
364413	366134	We were playing this game, loaded questions.
366915	368476	And Brad had to answer this question.
368516	371238	What's the problem that you would fix in America?
371759	375442	And he said, well, we should get rid of all the... I'll just leave the rest to your imagination.
375462	377023	But he got a lot of stuff thrown at him.
378204	378564	All right.
378684	380426	I think that's when I was sort of passing out.
381466	382247	Deprivation and alcohol.
382267	383028	You had a lot to drink.
383068	384429	We'll talk about drinking when we get back.
384489	385610	I didn't have a lot to drink.
385650	386230	I was just tired.
386290	387491	That stuff's pretty strong.
387511	388392	That stuff was weak.
389042	390243	No, you want to know what's worse than writing it?
390263	393065	You had, what, three shots and you were giggling on the floor rolling around?
393926	395688	I threw, like, stuff at you and you didn't move.
395708	396668	I don't have to be drunk to do that.
397389	398430	I don't have to be drunk to do that.
398470	400071	You put peanut butter cups on your head, too.
400612	401393	I put one in your ear.
401673	402594	No, wait, wait, hold on.
402634	403394	I got one thing to say.
403414	405436	You want to know what's worse than writing what was read?
406177	412462	Writing what was written was being the one who had to read it out loud and being afraid everyone's going to attack you instead of the person who wrote it.
413592	414513	Because everyone knew who wrote it.
415274	419239	And then somebody said, who tried to balance this bottle of Smirnoff Black on me while I was sleeping?
419259	420019	Was that you?
424344	424985	That wasn't fun.
426627	428069	Can we go to break now?
428169	428770	Alright, bye.
429550	429951	We'll be back.
434378	442341	Okay, I guess we're going to do one more, because I got these much better parody lyrics for Bumblebee than that shit I did a little bit ago, so we're going to do this one instead.
442361	446342	This comes from DDR Angel and Stress, this is much better, so enjoy.
446362	451063	I know I'm going to fuck this up, I apologize.
451083	451304	Fuck you.
451324	451584	Fuck you.
462970	467341	Sweet little bumblebee Get the fuck away from me Sweet little bumblebee
478405	502320	My foot kicks your ass when you walk in the room I go boom, boom, boom, you go zoom, zoom, zoom You're my format, dance pad, killable friend I wanna kick your ass until you're dead I'll shove my foot right up your ass To help you see it's true I don't like you, can't you see?
502740	504361	Now get the fuck away from me
506454	506994	Fuck you!
538681	538922	What?
797702	803846	with Orange Lounge Radio with the Ping Pong Boys.
807809	808349	Yay, we're back.
808629	809530	Yay, we are back.
809570	810530	Did you miss us?
811251	812071	Bork, bork, bork.
812392	815794	No, for that break we had Bumblebee's Sky's Wizard Mixer.
815814	817655	Just for the fact that I wanted to annoy Rob with it.
817775	821217	Thank you, by the way, Jamie, for embarrassing me because I had no idea she was going to be playing.
822188	833792	And surprisingly enough, a lot of people in the chatroom have not heard that before And a lot of people want to get an mp3 of that I'm not sure I should be advertising this I find that thing quite embarrassing I don't know why you guys like it so much Who wants it?
833812	845336	PM me No, I'll tell you I'll tell you what, even better Talk to Stressa I don't know if he's awake right now or active in chat I'm not sure I can't really see the chatroom from where I'm sitting Jamie's in the chat tonight
845876	846697	RobEatingPussy
862900	863080	Ew.
863521	864802	Go ahead, Jeremy.
866143	869245	If you want DWIs, go and ask Dressa.
869806	870386	Is he in chat?
870406	871747	He's not even in chat right now, is he?
872067	872108	No.
872148	872808	So I guess he's out.
873088	875030	But when he's around, ask him about it.
875710	877292	And I think some other folks might have it.
878072	880474	DDR Angel, I know, has it, but she's on vacation right now.
880494	881175	She's in Japan.
881195	881575	Japan.
883016	884597	We'll find a way for you folks to get it.
884617	885798	I'm sure Loki will put it up.
886399	887860	Speaking of DWIs and Loki...
890117	891878	I'm eating fucking pretzels right now, man.
892218	893258	Ooh, his mouth is full.
893338	893858	My bad.
894438	895439	Well, how was your week, Jamie?
895499	896119	We'll get back to that.
896799	898940	How was... Is everybody going to eat?
899000	900901	So I have to just sit here and just talk to myself.
900981	901641	How are you, Zero?
902501	902821	Fine.
903161	903901	I have new horses.
904382	904882	You have new horses?
904962	906322	Oh, let's talk about yesterday's trip.
906342	906842	That was fun.
907002	908163	That was fun.
908523	910003	To go play Derby Owner's Crack.
910063	910364	Mm-hmm.
911344	911404	Um...
912592	918158	For those that don't know what Derby Owner's Crack is, it's a game where you race horsies, and it's a lot of fun.
918878	920660	It's like Initial D, but horses.
920800	923783	But you don't actually ride the horses like you drive the car.
924043	924724	You just whip them.
924764	928327	You have a big button for your whip, and you just beat your horse to get them to run faster.
928868	929829	And you breed them.
930289	932932	And then if you do well in the races, people give you things.
933112	934834	I have a horse named Politary.
935618	937181	and she gets chicks and pussies.
937581	941348	Like, every time I win a race, a chick will come to the stable, or a cat.
941528	943832	So, you know, Politary gets the chicks and gets the pussy.
944012	944493	What can you say?
947924	949205	Hi, we're doing a show, hi.
949286	950947	Hello, what's up, what's going on?
951047	952729	Hey, wait, Anita, Anita, Anita, come back.
953009	953790	Anita, come say hi.
953990	954130	Hi.
954150	955832	Hi, everybody, how are you?
955912	964801	We don't get women on this show very often, and poor Jamie's starting to... Well, I mean, Jamie, you were bitching about this the other day, that you're like, I'm the only woman on that whole show.
965202	965863	I'm all for you.
966703	970025	Hey, it only takes like a few because women rule.
970545	971926	Oh, is it going to be one of those nights?
971946	974847	Every one of us is at least worth a thousand of you.
975187	984831	Is this going to be one of those nights where it sounds like we're at some women's rights march and my vagina is a vortex from which all life explodes.
987833	989013	Lastly got Orange Lounge.
991139	994942	By the way, I did find a site for Derby Owners Club, so you can see what the machine looks like.
995822	1002266	Go to expertdoc.flex.com And you'll post that in the chat room, won't you?
1002286	1003607	I just did already.
1003747	1004768	That is Derby Owners Club.
1008110	1009250	It's very casino-like.
1009330	1011652	It's purposely looking like that.
1011672	1013613	I made four new horses.
1013733	1015014	One of them was called This is a Horse.
1017355	1019577	The other one was called Happy Bunny, which won a bunch of races.
1021071	1039157	and then Mel and Melody let me use two of their horses to breed a horse because I used one called Vanilla Ice that was all albino and then Saved by the Bell as in B-E-L-L-E That horse rules.
1040318	1041919	The front part was black and the back was white.
1042739	1043780	And I bred a tiger horse.
1045001	1048484	Gold and white with tiger stripes and gold eyes and a tiger tail and everything.
1048584	1050645	It looks like a tiger, but it's a horse.
1050945	1051766	What's up with that?
1053047	1056329	And I thought it was going to be a boy because I've been breeding nothing but boys lately.
1056750	1059752	And this one was a girl, so I couldn't get the name I originally wanted.
1060232	1062754	Last week on Orange Lounge, I've been breeding nothing but boys lately.
1064896	1067077	So I named it Strong Badette.
1068789	1069209	Very nice.
1069929	1073210	And my other horse's name is for people who's missed it.
1073270	1074831	My very first horse was Slytherin Chaser.
1075411	1076491	Because you're a Harry Potter whore.
1077711	1080452	And then I had, I like cheese.
1081873	1084953	And then Hot Man Sex, S-E-C-H-S.
1085013	1086574	Because the machine will try to censor you.
1087466	1093831	and then I had Fajitas and Jin Kazama because I'm a Tekken whore.
1094251	1094691	Very nice.
1094851	1096192	I made two new horses yesterday.
1096613	1100015	I made a horse dedicated to one of my favorite Animal Crossing characters, Elmer.
1100675	1101436	So I made Elmer the horse.
1101456	1102997	And then I made a horse called Sir Mix-a-Lot.
1103517	1106199	My next horse I'm going to make is called Glue Factory.
1107781	1108321	Glue Factory?
1108501	1109041	Glue Factory.
1109081	1109482	Very nice.
1110623	1111483	Rob is da funny.
1113024	1113625	I'm just reading.
1113825	1115146	I'm trying to catch up on chat room, so...
1115782	1117864	Horsey sex is bad, I want to make a law about that.
1118044	1119445	Horses have to have sex too!
1119465	1123067	Have you ever seen a horse that has got any... That's the thing about Derby Owners Club.
1123087	1126510	Derby Owners Club has this really explicit birthing scene to it.
1126810	1130133	Like when you make a new horse for the first time... They go on a date.
1130573	1131354	They go on a date.
1131394	1133495	They send off the horses and they trot off.
1134476	1138659	And then they go to a tree and it fades out so you don't have to see horsey sex.
1138879	1144003	But then the next scene is them in a stable and then you see the male horse being all nurturing or whatever.
1144043	1145064	The male horse isn't even there.
1145544	1146965	The male horse is there, kind of looking.
1146985	1148206	The male horse is just kind of looking.
1148446	1149847	No, the mare is laying down.
1151048	1155470	All I know is that you see the female horse, and all of a sudden it looks like she's going to take a giant crap.
1155490	1156131	No, it doesn't.
1156151	1158032	And then all of a sudden there's a little baby.
1158272	1160334	No, that's not how it happens.
1161034	1162455	I swear to God that's what I saw.
1162595	1162795	No.
1163356	1164476	Yes, thank you for that.
1164536	1167438	The mare is laying down, and the foal is laying beside her.
1168079	1173282	And the foal gets up and goes, you know, it's like suddenly there's another horse, and then suddenly it's an adult.
1174452	1175612	Happy Bunny is still childish.
1177433	1179113	That horse sort of looks like Mr. Garrison.
1182453	1184334	I would not want to be Mr. Hat and have a hand on my ass.
1184354	1187974	The chat room is referencing a movie called Freddy Got Fingered, which I never bothered to watch.
1189015	1194195	Because, you're going to have to explain this to me, because I never found Tom Green funny.
1194215	1198376	I don't know if it's just me, but... He masturbates a horse in that.
1198936	1199736	So look what I can do!
1199896	1200616	Look what I can do!
1200737	1201457	Look what I can do!
1202597	1203477	Brilliant comedy.
1204076	1204476	Brilliant.
1205577	1214022	But anyway, that site that I just linked in the chatroom, there are screen captures of a... See, look, there's the mayor and there's the freaking pony.
1214103	1218145	I swear to God, I had one where the chick was squatting and then out comes baby.
1218425	1219346	That is not what happened.
1219386	1220987	It's a hidden... I got an Easter egg.
1221587	1223368	Boy, was it ever an egg.
1226190	1227331	Okay, chatroom, look at this.
1227371	1230153	Does that look like the mayor is giving birth?
1230974	1231234	No.
1231554	1232375	It's a vicious lie.
1232415	1233255	That's photoshopped.
1234036	1239059	Although one thing that's in here that makes me a little bit wondering is there's a picture of the horse walking on a path.
1239779	1240460	That's the one.
1240520	1243061	Okay, there's the exercises you can do to the horse.
1243101	1244302	There's one where you can rest it.
1244382	1250446	The item all the way on the right is just like rest your horse and it goes on a trot through the forest and it's like your horse is relaxing.
1251486	1253047	To which it gets attacked by a bear and dies.
1253547	1254048	Hey!
1254808	1255669	Now that would be cool.
1256770	1258832	Is it true that there's a Derby Owners Club 2 coming out?
1259412	1260573	Um, yeah, let me find the site again.
1260873	1261614	Someone hold the microphone.
1261954	1262194	Okay.
1264095	1264295	What?
1264636	1264856	Hi.
1265056	1266697	Anybody else in here ever played Derby Owners Crack?
1267598	1268218	Nobody else has played?
1269199	1270320	I have four horses.
1270740	1272721	I've got... What are you guys doing?
1273162	1273522	Okay, anyways.
1273802	1276184	I got, um... I have a horse called Mr. Spanky.
1277525	1280687	An ode to the stupid character from DDR PC.
1281588	1288432	We've got one called Big Black Cock, which was an inside joke on the show, so I have that.
1288492	1300959	And then I've got one called... I've got one called Cloud, and that was the one I stole from the little girl.
1301419	1301740	And then...
1303586	1304047	What was it?
1305348	1306248	Loki is not lying.
1306309	1307790	He did steal that card from a little girl.
1310312	1311372	Shit, I have another one too.
1311673	1312673	I can't remember what it was called.
1312934	1315095	That's why all the kids run across the panels on you.
1315135	1316697	They attack you for stealing cards.
1316797	1318358	They're just stupid, those kids.
1318418	1319218	But I'll go into it later.
1319419	1319779	Trip them.
1321901	1322141	Okay.
1323001	1324903	I want to talk about what pissed me off yesterday, though.
1325463	1327425	This kind of goes into an FU of the week, but not really.
1329031	1330611	Okay, because this is video game related.
1330671	1339134	Okay, the Derby Owners Club, the way it works is you have one giant monitor, and there's eight little stations that you can sit at to play, so theoretically eight people can play the game at once.
1339694	1343035	And if you visited the website that was given out in the chatroom, you saw a picture, so you know what I'm talking about.
1343595	1348696	Okay, well, at Milpitas Golf Land on a Saturday, it's pretty busy, so there's a lot of people that kind of want to play, and it's kind of full.
1349796	1351537	Well, you know, so I'm sitting there kind of waiting.
1351697	1352578	I'm waiting for a game.
1353018	1356900	And there's freaking people just sitting there at the stations not doing anything.
1356920	1359361	And they're just like, they just have all their crap there.
1359381	1363863	And like you can try and like wave at them, you know, go, hi, I want to play.
1363923	1365244	And they just totally ignore you.
1365264	1366124	They're totally oblivious to you.
1366144	1368025	Some of the people there were actually waiting on particular races.
1368366	1370807	And see, I think that, personally, I think that's bullshit.
1371187	1372808	Like if you're going to do that, if you're going to...
1373394	1377895	If you're going to do that where you're just going to sit on the game and wait for particular races, you need to do that on weeknight when no one's there.
1378315	1379775	You need not do that in the middle of a Saturday.
1379855	1383116	So, poo on you, you derby squatters.
1385017	1387397	Guess that's happened to me with the initial D before.
1388597	1397119	It's the difference between having two, where people are taking, where there's big lines of people, and then one with eight terminals, and people are just sitting there.
1397439	1399720	There's a difference between initial D and Derby Owners Club.
1400220	1400480	Mm-hmm.
1402259	1404262	Initial D is not better.
1404822	1405944	Initial D is smelly.
1406064	1406484	Come on.
1409568	1410970	Johnny's fighting.
1410990	1411351	Whatever.
1413774	1414254	Whatever.
1420976	1421457	Who?
1421657	1424199	You got admonished, Mr. Loki.
1426502	1429084	Ninja Usagi Koi says, bad, stealing from kids.
1429284	1430385	Who said that?
1430406	1430806	Ninja Usagi Koi.
1430886	1432608	Well, I didn't technically steal it.
1432668	1434930	She was dumb and left it there, so I took it.
1436712	1439014	Okay, taking advantage of other people's stupidity is okay.
1440816	1442778	Should we actually try to have FUs of the week?
1443218	1443619	Well, let's...
1445472	1446072	Thank you for watching!
1466708	1478234	Okay, Poppin' Music 8 is coming out, and they've estimated that it's going to have over 100 songs on it, plus a new mode that's called Live Mode, which has something to do with these live videos of them playing.
1478274	1480395	I don't know what the fuck it is, because I don't play Poppin' Music.
1480595	1482556	I played it once, and I didn't like it, so there.
1483416	1483976	Yeah, great.
1484017	1485217	Where's 2DX7Style?
1486658	1488899	Why do they keep cranking out the Poppin' Music?
1488939	1490980	Hello, 2DX7Style has already been announced.
1491903	1492203	When?
1492784	1493084	When?
1493144	1494265	I thought it was coming out in April.
1494665	1495406	I think that's just a rumor.
1496026	1496487	Whatever.
1499909	1501370	We're going to research this a little bit.
1502351	1505734	You know, I should really pay attention to all this news since I read it all the time.
1505754	1506054	You know what?
1506714	1507655	Poppin' Music, it's okay.
1507695	1508416	I mean, I like it.
1508516	1508976	It's cool.
1508996	1515681	But I think the reason a lot of people like it a lot, seriously, is because they don't have it many places.
1515721	1518403	So, like, having played it is like a special club.
1518603	1520645	Like, your leader, if you've played Poppin' Music or whatever...
1521579	1525100	Poppin' Music's cool and all, and it has some good tunes, but it makes my freaking hands hurt.
1525400	1528461	What about Aerobics Revolution, huh, huh?
1529741	1533923	Oh, and Max 2 for the Japanese home version, Max 2.
1536223	1540344	Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Matt the Ice Princess has a question, or I'm sorry, the Ice Queen.
1540604	1544085	Hold on, you have to speak into the mic so they can all hear you.
1544105	1549507	Alright, so why don't you go ahead and enlighten all of us idiots out here who don't know what the hell you're talking about when you talk about Poppin' Music.
1551325	1551965	I'll let Loki do it.
1553506	1562269	Pop music is like 2DX, but you have big buttons that are round, you know, kind of like the bishy-boshy buttons, big round buttons, and you just, yeah, like trouble.
1562409	1565430	Yes, it's like nine pop-o-matic bubbles that you have to hit in tune to music.
1565710	1566910	That's an excellent way of describing it.
1566930	1567330	Thank you, Bombay.
1567370	1574333	It's just, it's like, it's almost like if you were to take 2DX and turn it into like a Saturday morning cartoon, that's what it would be.
1574493	1577694	It's just like all nice and stuff, but it's still kind of difficult like 2DX.
1579199	1579399	Overplay
1597546	1599447	POPPING MUSIC
1616019	1624245	They've got some weird shit, weird modifiers on there and stuff, but it's pretty much like... But it's more like happy and rainbow-y and gay, because like the buttons are these big, right?
1624325	1625586	Yeah, yeah, I knew that would make you cheer.
1625866	1629429	Yeah, it's got these big like red and yellow and blue and green buttons and they all flash.
1629849	1632151	And little things that fall, it's falling pancakes.
1632271	1632932	That's what they look like.
1632952	1635033	They're big falling pancakes that have big eyes on them.
1635053	1636174	They go, hi, meet me.
1636454	1639917	And they hit the button when they hit the blind and they go, ooh, excellent.
1642153	1669909	But like, sometimes you have to hit four buttons at once So you're playing the game like this with your elbows Well, that's good radio, no one can see that I know, okay You all did though Imagine doing the Tran Dance in the Stoic video That's kind of like what playing some poppin' music is Anyways And the only place I know of anywhere that has poppin' music I think they have a machine in Portland Yes, Bombay
1670552	1675454	Yeah, I found one in Orange County, actually, at Camelot Golfland.
1675474	1676815	Oh, I'll be damned.
1676915	1677635	In Orange County.
1678335	1679196	That's the one near Disneyland.
1679376	1680536	Camelot, yeah, CMGO.
1681016	1681537	It's pretty tight.
1681837	1682857	I didn't get a chance to play.
1682897	1684318	There's actually a lot of people playing, so.
1684518	1685938	And then, of course, AI has one.
1686059	1688299	They have Pop Music 9, which I did get to play when I was down there.
1688319	1692701	Well, yeah, when we went down there, they had that shitty M, whatever that is, stupid MLO.
1692761	1693902	See, now that's one of Janie's favorites.
1694542	1697565	That one sucked ass.
1697585	1700387	If you like anime, it's going to have all the songs you like in it.
1701088	1703990	Mambo Go Go was better than that.
1704030	1705291	Leave me alone, I'm white.
1711577	1713198	I can't pronounce shit tonight, leave me alone.
1715720	1716901	But, uh, yeah.
1717622	1718443	Um, let's see here.
1719548	1723311	Other than that, it's just a lot of home versions coming out.
1723352	1726274	Pretty much everyone's waiting for Max 2 to come out.
1726314	1727896	We talked about that a little bit last week.
1727916	1729057	And then there's Aerobics Revolution.
1729077	1730678	I'm so moist from excitement about Max 2.
1730718	1731739	That no one gives a shit about.
1732159	1736003	Have they figured out if there's going to be anything special in it yet?
1736023	1737824	Have they announced any features or anything like that?
1737844	1739626	They announced how many songs there's supposed to be.
1739766	1740006	How many?
1740026	1740267	How many?
1740387	1740727	How many?
1741187	1742008	I don't remember!
1742949	1743670	It's like 60 or 70.
1744330	1744931	You're fired.
1746013	1747194	You don't do anything.
1748215	1749876	Loki, you're supposed to remember these things.
1749937	1759125	Yeah, when I'm like busy running a couple sites and doing shit for my work and... Listen, my job on this show is to be cute, and I fulfill that, so... What's your job?
1759165	1759825	Bring us news.
1759845	1760786	Are you bringing us news?
1761847	1762528	The fuck?
1764149	1765270	That's messed up, man.
1765550	1766891	You're bringing us like half the news.
1766931	1768493	You're like MSNBC, Jesus.
1770635	1771876	Oh, oh, okay.
1773746	1775007	No, on Microsoft.
1775127	1775547	No.
1776548	1776888	Let's see.
1776908	1778008	I'm trying to think.
1778609	1779989	I don't really know much about that.
1780009	1782211	I have, like, gossip news.
1782451	1782851	Oh, okay.
1784438	1791600	As reported on DDR Mania X in one of their random topic things, Monty Ruler, his backgrounds, he didn't make them.
1792140	1792940	He stole them.
1793200	1794080	Gossip!
1794180	1795001	Oh my god.
1795141	1795781	So who did?
1796221	1796861	Who cares?
1797181	1797601	Who did?
1799081	1799442	Who did?
1799622	1800642	He just got them off some sites.
1800702	1801402	It doesn't really matter.
1801582	1804703	So like he downloaded the artwork and just added the text or what?
1804763	1805323	Yeah, pretty much.
1807028	1807849	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1831019	1835663	I thought for whatever reason you had a grudge against him or something and you would have liked that news.
1835723	1837324	I don't have a grudge against him.
1838204	1839966	I do not have a grudge against him.
1841067	1843448	The only thing I was saying was that his step-files are too hard.
1844009	1845670	You cannot possibly play them on the feet.
1846170	1848312	I mean, try playing Stoic on a pad.
1848352	1850814	That's like... Hot Limit's not a ham.
1852115	1853036	You're Hot Limit, whatever.
1854316	1857359	No, I'm just talking... It's just... I don't know, his stuff's hard.
1857839	1858239	I don't like it.
1858920	1860301	Everyone calls it 4-key beat mania.
1861229	1862150	Yeah, I'd say it's pretty accurate.
1863190	1864271	But, um, yeah.
1864311	1866272	So wait, how do you get news like that?
1866352	1870475	I mean, so a site actually ran a news story saying, guess what?
1870495	1872476	Actually, it was a forum post, so.
1872576	1873717	Oh, it was a forum post.
1873757	1875838	Oh, I thought it was like, I thought it was like front page.
1876078	1877059	I'm like, that's pretty sad.
1877359	1882002	You know it's a slow news day when the front page news is, uh-uh, bitch didn't do his own art.
1884295	1885616	Who gives a shit anyways?
1885636	1891420	It's like art isn't really a big... Well, yeah, it makes your file look nice, but it has nothing to do with the steps at all.
1892101	1897544	And I think the only thing was is because... Maybe, okay, maybe because TourneyMix, they insisted that you make your own backgrounds, right?
1897624	1899606	And didn't he... Wasn't he a judge for that?
1900466	1901087	I don't know.
1901707	1903889	Well, he was a judge in the last one, but...
1904795	1906135	Whatever.
1906155	1912537	Well, I invite him for an interview on this show to clear the air, if he or any of his cohorts are listening.
1912557	1916759	I don't really know half the stories, because obviously I'm only reporting half the stories, since that's what you said.
1917399	1926081	I don't even know, I just think he might have been claiming that he did all the artwork, instead of just saying, hey, I got this from here, I have the text, done.
1926262	1929522	I mean, if he just came forward and said that, everything would be fine.
1930023	1931003	That's all it is, but...
1931761	1934583	Yeah, it was really fucking slow as far as nudes goes.
1934663	1935403	There's nothing.
1935443	1935743	You know what?
1935843	1936684	I want him on the show.
1936784	1937724	How can we make that happen?
1937965	1940626	I want to get him on the show and have him explain what happened.
1940666	1943768	That's never going to happen, so isn't that your job?
1944048	1945009	Getting guests on the show?
1945029	1945769	I'll see what I can do.
1945789	1947950	It's never going to fucking happen.
1948611	1949491	It doesn't matter.
1949511	1950652	Who cares?
1954794	1955515	So what's coming up?
1958657	1958817	What's 4.15? 4.15?
1960399	1965081	According to BuyRight, Beatmania 2DX7 style is coming out on April 15th of 2003.
1966241	1969523	But BuyRight is a shitty-ass place to order games from anyway.
1970503	1973444	Because they cheated me with my Tekken 4 and they suck and need to die.
1973945	1974645	Bitter, are we?
1978246	1980167	Bitter, party of one, your table's ready, bitter.
1980187	1981027	Don't bite my ass.
1981788	1982228	But, um...
1983666	2000053	But I mean, I don't know if anyone can find any... If anyone can look on Konami's Japanese site and find me proof that they have something up for Beatmania TDX7 style to be out and on home, or from any reliable place, send me a PM in the chatroom, please.
2000753	2002294	DarkSakura, SSF.
2002314	2003715	Speaking of chatroom, what's going on in there?
2004355	2005616	I'm talking about NCSX.
2005636	2007857	I was just looking at NCSX and I didn't see any pre-order stuff.
2008437	2010698	I'm going to actually check NCSX right now.
2013699	2015541	Okay, so what else is going on?
2016763	2017504	MSNB Loki?
2019306	2019646	Damn right!
2029707	2051319	Now, you know, you'd be surprised, like, all the stuff that I do during the week, because basically my job, for those who don't know, I'm answering phones and talking to people, and I have my, you know, I have my Internet Explorer open all the time, you know, browsing webpages, because we're on T1, and I download about 500 megs worth of files every week, and, you know, so that's what I do all day.
2051559	2056922	So I read about eight forums at the same time, all day long, and, um,
2059311	2065878	You'd think that I would know more what's going on, but really, to be honest, for the last three months, there has been nothing going on in the news.
2066078	2070183	Our shows have been just kind of like, okay, just find some new shit to talk about.
2070944	2071485	Nothing there.
2071945	2072146	So...
2073186	2084495	It really isn't that much going on right now, other than waiting for the home version of Max to come, which is probably going to have the same rehashed shit from DDR Max USA, which, you know, some of those songs.
2084916	2090860	But at least we'll be able to make edits for it and stuff, and maybe a few new songs for Extreme 2 and whatnot.
2091061	2098387	And then, obviously, probably later on this year we'll have some news about DDR Extreme 2 and its development and all that stuff.
2100688	2102170	and then, you know, that kind of stuff.
2102210	2104271	But right now, there's not too much.
2104591	2109555	New Guitar Freaks, obviously, is being, I think, playtested right now.
2111117	2115620	I want it to be available somewhere else besides, like, where you know it'll go to RPGL.
2116741	2121385	Let's talk about MoCap Golf, because we just got it at Sandia, and that game looks really fun.
2123202	2132305	Before we get on the mocap golf tangent, I just wanted to say, I'm looking at BimaniX.com, and they have 2DX 7th style coming out in August for the PS2.
2132325	2133885	So take that in your will.
2133925	2141828	However, they said that Beat Me is 7th mix, plus the finals coming out on PS2 in March, but I haven't heard anything about that yet, seeing as, hmm, it's March.
2142708	2145009	Uh, yeah, it's kind of surprising.
2145689	2147730	If my memory serves me right, I think it was the 24th or 25th.
2147910	2150330	Yeah, I thought I heard that was going to be late March.
2151131	2152451	Yeah, like last week.
2153766	2156628	Well, gee, Konami of Japan's doing a great job promoting it.
2158430	2160671	Well, they do a great job with everything, like, you know.
2162232	2165655	Now, wasn't it supposed to come out, oh, I don't know, Christmas Eve last year?
2165675	2171700	Well, if I remember right, what they said about Christmas Eve was that that was just supposed to be 7th Mix for the PS1.
2172500	2175202	And now they're doing 7th Mix plus the final PS2, whatever.
2175843	2176723	Eh, who cares?
2176743	2178845	Could you get on the boat, CapGolf, now?
2180007	2182789	And, like, an open letter to, like, frickin', um, Konami.
2183750	2185391	Why are you ignoring Dead End?
2185851	2188452	I mean, that song back in third mix is a pretty cool song.
2188492	2189513	You haven't remixed it at all.
2189553	2195016	You've, like, remixed the hell out of Trip Machine and Paranoia and all those brilliant tunes and shit.
2195056	2196718	I wanna see Dead End in 2DX.
2197838	2198178	Yeah.
2199419	2200260	That would be kinda cool.
2201420	2202301	Alright, MoCapGolf.
2202521	2203782	Okay, MoCapGolf, yes.
2205423	2207164	Greatest motion capture game ever.
2207864	2208565	It is so cool.
2210938	2212519	It is damn cool, don't say that.
2212539	2213959	It freaking rules.
2214259	2218840	Dude, what other game can you hit a golf ball off the top of a building onto another one?
2219920	2224321	Give him a microphone so I can bitch at him.
2224341	2232363	The only reason I'm mad is because over at Scandio, we're supposed to have Soul Calibur already, but instead I went into work today and saw a golf game.
2233044	2234604	Now, that made me kind of mad.
2235942	2238365	I think a lot of other people... Soul Calibur 2's been out for a while now.
2238685	2240226	I know, but I'm waiting for it.
2240286	2246212	Like, Keith said he has this really, really awesome system for it, and I'm really excited about it.
2246373	2247374	But he just needs the software.
2248034	2248595	Okay, yes.
2248715	2250076	Broaden your horizons.
2250156	2251237	That's all I need to say.
2251458	2252138	Golf, man.
2252279	2252599	Golf.
2254781	2256682	I like Soul Calibur, but I don't know.
2256702	2258642	I tend to want to play other things now.
2259082	2261823	You know what game... It's not golf's better, it's just good.
2261843	2264364	They need Tsuguri, the sword game.
2266024	2268085	It was called in America Blade of Honor or something.
2268905	2272166	And you can play it in like different sword styles and everything too.
2272526	2273167	That would be cool.
2273367	2274787	And like you can cut people in half.
2275547	2277168	And I played it in Vegas.
2277228	2277688	Vegas?
2278408	2281369	Because they actually had the Tsuguri one.
2281569	2282389	It was at New York.
2282750	2283510	I am going there.
2284391	2290642	I paid four bucks actually to play that game and have a replay.
2292686	2293628	It's Vegas.
2293648	2294650	No one can hear what you're saying, by the way.
2298772	2300973	I played it in Orange County and it was only eight nickels.
2301593	2304694	Well, there, but I was in Vegas and everything costs more in Vegas.
2305254	2307135	That was the only place I had ever seen it.
2307915	2314537	Um, but that game kicks mocap, you know, takes mocap golf, bends it over and says, hey, here's a sword, guess where it is?
2317138	2319138	Yeah, but usually golf clubs are longer than swords.
2321079	2321639	Swords hurt more.
2322059	2322779	They're sharper.
2323360	2325340	Have you ever been hit with a golf ball before?
2325360	2327761	Have you ever been anally raped by a sword?
2329761	2330121	Have you?
2332922	2333522	I read a lot.
2334042	2335082	That's all you could come up with?
2335202	2335602	Have you?
2336823	2338263	Yes, that's all I could come up with right now.
2338283	2339904	This is like another Dave over here.
2340144	2341404	I'm like open all night.
2341424	2343965	Yeah, he's like CCL Dave.
2344185	2345005	Lightning Dave.
2345165	2346985	I will just be on the attack all night.
2347585	2348126	I'm just kidding.
2348546	2349986	Because you play mocap golf.
2350426	2352067	And you can play on the beach.
2353267	2357168	And for the record, by the way, I have been hit with a golf ball in the neck.
2357548	2357968	So, yeah.
2360325	2364927	We're at, oh, I mean, no, not, no, where is it, where is it, someone actually hit it?
2367048	2368249	Someone hit a golf ball.
2368269	2369730	No, she threw it at herself.
2369850	2370610	Into my neck.
2372791	2373691	At themselves?
2373932	2374432	In the throat.
2374472	2375552	You're kind of an idiot, aren't you?
2378054	2380635	They're gonna throw the ball at my throat!
2381215	2381635	Oh!
2381795	2382496	Oh, man!
2383296	2384857	It sounds so like you, Loki.
2385917	2387198	Rob's drinking nuclear waste.
2391823	2398205	This green drink that I'm drinking is Hawaiian Punch Green Blast, or what's it called?
2398225	2399886	Hawaiian Punch Green Shit Flavor.
2400586	2404147	I think they only had it in SoCal, and now they have it at the Ralph's by my house.
2405167	2406868	Yes, it's very nice.
2407468	2409728	I blame Melody for getting me hooked to that.
2410148	2412429	I'm going to share my accomplishment with everyone on the radio here.
2412909	2415170	I am nine days without soda.
2415410	2416830	I haven't had a soda in nine days.
2416850	2419231	We're starting a 12-step program, Soda Drinkers Anonymous.
2422342	2448387	I should crack open a Pepsi, fuck off So yeah, now this is a big deal for me Because I usually have a Mountain Dew in the morning just to wake up And then like, you know, I drink like three vanilla Cokes when I get home So it's a pretty big deal, so Of course, Hawaiian Punch really isn't that much better for you than soda But eh, you know, it's a special day You know what, it's a special day, so eat shit
2451513	2455256	Okay, so should we take a break for a minute?
2456176	2456997	Should we take a break for a minute?
2457698	2458818	You want to do the FUs when we come back?
2462621	2466104	Prepare yourself for the FUs that are coming up when we get back.
2466584	2471508	If you would like to submit an FU, remember, tonight we're at Jamie's, so don't send them to me.
2471808	2474470	You'll see my name in the chatroom says I'm out, out and about.
2475180	2476320	So you want to send them to Jamie.
2476400	2478601	Her nickname is DarkSakuraSSF.
2478761	2480362	So send your FUs of the week to Jamie.
2480802	2483022	And we'll try to keep it short this week, we promise.
2483082	2485303	Everybody in the room is going to keep them short tonight, yes?
2485583	2487104	FUs will be short tonight, yes?
2489124	2489404	No?
2490645	2492365	Alright, so short FUs tonight.
2492465	2494906	Okay, so we'll be back in a little bit.
2495206	2497567	Okay, we'll stretch a little more.
2498576	2499537	Let me plug the website.
2499557	2500458	Let me plug the chat room.
2500478	2504561	If you want to be able to submit those FUs, you've got to get to our chat room, and the chat room's at our website.
2504861	2508944	Just orange line, skie.cx, and then click on chat.
2509304	2510866	That URL's a little hard to remember.
2510926	2512427	I've got a much easier one for you to remember.
2512707	2521574	Just go to calibamani.com, C-A-L-I-B-A-M-A-N-I dot com, and we're an affiliate of calibamani.com, so they've got a link right there on the front page to the radio station.
2523712	2529017	You should do a TK, like register a TK, you know, one of those.
2530078	2530218	No.
2532440	2532860	Fine!
2535000	2536081	Yeah, but they cost money.
2536281	2542723	Actually, yeah, when I get a little more money, I'm going to purchase a .org on behalf of the stations, or .com or .org, so we'll be at Orange Lounge Radio or Orange Lounge.
2542763	2543304	How about .tv?
2543484	2545665	Because all the good websites have .tv.
2545925	2549547	And then we could say, as seen on TV, even though, you know, we've never been on TV.
2549627	2554469	Well, I was on TV for Understation Live, and Jamie's name was in the chat room.
2554489	2561612	My friend Sean wants us to take our recordings of the show and actually broadcast them on public access radio.
2563175	2565096	Can you say shit and fuck on public access radio?
2565136	2565697	I don't think so.
2566898	2572962	Sure you can, they just might censor, I don't know, whatever.
2573022	2576504	If they censored this show, there'd be like three episodes worth of time.
2577845	2579446	Shit, fuck, damn, cock, pussy.
2580967	2581367	Cut!
2583589	2584289	That's my favorite.
2584410	2587592	Little known fact, I actually was a public access celebrity.
2591275	2592177	Okay, we're going to break.
2592197	2592918	Alright, we're going to break.
2592938	2593178	Bye.
2593359	2595883	We're playing our fuck you songs, so stay tuned.
2629481	2630161	Rock'n'roll!
2630181	2630561	Junkie!
2630581	2630882	JoJo!
2658379	2663605	Miyato, Konoha, Tosuke, Jojo
2803228	2803589	Yeah, Dr. Bob!
2963550	2968214	Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Solid Snake Can you hear what I'm saying?
2968574	2976481	Well, this damn sicko man's in a wheelchair bag I'm gonna kick your ass, beat him, kill him, oh Don't, what am I gonna do?
2976501	2978262	Don't, don't, what am I gonna do?
2979283	2980324	Don't, what am I gonna do?
2980344	2986529	Don't, don't Have you ever seen a cool game like this?
2992898	2999483	Niko Meow, Niko Meow, Niko Meow, Meow, Meow, Meow Oh, ass!
3000003	3002705	This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.
3006608	3007929	I'm eating a taquito.
3009089	3010811	We are eating taquitos.
3010951	3012171	Taquito!
3012191	3013813	I love taquitos.
3013853	3015234	The official food of Orange Lounge?
3015254	3015594	I don't know.
3017215	3019176	Thank you, Ice Queen, for getting the taquitos.
3019196	3019897	They're delicious.
3021232	3022132	I hate them good.
3022532	3022793	Why?
3023513	3024593	Because I don't like Mexican food.
3025193	3026014	Because it makes you poop?
3026694	3027994	No, I just don't like Mexican food.
3031736	3033136	Their food sucks ass!
3033216	3036377	That's what I have against them.
3037077	3038138	Loki, you forgot the water, too.
3039542	3047265	But I'm pleasantly surprised that, what was it, Chevys, they have hot wings and they were damn good.
3047665	3049406	That was the only thing I ate last night at Chevys.
3049426	3051986	Chevys has damn good fajitas because they have that cornmeal stuff.
3053147	3056468	And me, I'm allergic to corn, but I will eat that cornmeal stuff like all day.
3056508	3059149	I had them give me an extra thing of it and I did nothing but eat that cornmeal one day.
3059990	3066074	Amanda, one of the official lesbians of Orange Launch Radio who was here a couple weeks ago, we were at Chevy's the other day and she kept threatening to tell them it was my birthday.
3066414	3068835	And that got me to thinking, you know, how would the restaurants know?
3068975	3072758	Like, you know, if you go in there every time you eat and tell them it's your birthday, they'd never know, huh?
3072978	3074299	And you can get, like, free ice cream.
3074619	3079041	Well, okay, as long as you didn't go to the same Chevy's every week, okay, then they'd probably catch on.
3079281	3083604	But, you know, if you go a different... Then again, they'd probably, like, keep track of it.
3083624	3085085	They'd, like, take pictures of you, like...
3085405	3086346	They don't take pictures.
3086366	3088727	Have you ever seen them snap a camera as they're singing happy birthday?
3088787	3091148	No, they put the sombrero on your head, sing their verse, they leave.
3092709	3095130	If you don't tip them, then they'll know who you are.
3097391	3098412	That's a thing we should do.
3098512	3102754	Just, like, send you out to as many places and see how many places you get a birthday at a day.
3103174	3105756	For, like, a week and just see what you can do.
3105776	3106896	Okay, okay, we can do it.
3107256	3108517	Yeah, well, you can pull that off.
3110245	3110965	You're the intern, though.
3110985	3112006	You have to do the embarrassing stuff.
3112026	3112726	We'll tell them it's your birthday.
3112747	3113727	I have to do the embarrassing stuff?
3113947	3114648	Oh, thank you.
3115208	3116148	See, I love my birthday.
3116168	3117229	And then we'll give me the ice cream.
3117709	3122312	My birthday kicks ass because I get to be cheerful and everyone's, like, so sad.
3122752	3123193	I love it.
3123413	3127875	That was the best gift anyone could give me was the death of thousands and thousands of people on my birthday.
3134219	3134839	Let's see.
3134979	3138681	Unpolitically correct statement took less than an hour this time into the show.
3138742	3139442	Congratulations.
3141141	3143082	I think we should get to the fuck you's of the week, right?
3143462	3144563	Yeah, good idea.
3144603	3144903	Sure.
3145524	3145844	Okay.
3146644	3151527	Um, but we don't have, we can't play music in the background because my mixer sucks and I need a new sound card.
3151928	3153168	Anyone wants to get me a new sound card?
3153629	3153949	Thank you.
3154549	3154809	Anyway.
3155890	3157451	First fuck you of the week goes to my sound card.
3161293	3162374	I'm sorry, Cacuaint.
3162774	3163034	Okay.
3163394	3164734	This is fucked up.
3167676	3171837	Um... Also, it goes toward having no money right now because I'm paying for my car.
3172777	3182621	Um... Also... It goes toward, um... Not being able to go buy myself, like, more socks because I have this unnatural sock collection.
3182641	3183501	Look at my socks.
3183521	3183942	They're cool.
3185742	3187663	My socks look like a big pink and black barcode.
3188643	3188883	Anyway.
3190104	3190184	Um...
3192130	3192550	I said you are $2.37.
3192710	3193230	Okay.
3193290	3197852	I actually only have $11 I make right now.
3198813	3200673	Um, fuck you to bandwidth.
3202054	3204875	And I really am not angsty about much of anything else.
3205876	3206096	Cool.
3206476	3207376	Fuck you to work tomorrow.
3207396	3207956	I don't want to go.
3208957	3209257	Next.
3214702	3232817	Let's see, my FUs of the week are FU to those people that squat on Derby Owners Club, that sucks FU to gas prices, oh my god Even the cheap shit's two bucks a gallon, F that What else do I want to say FU to?
3235139	3241625	And, I don't know, FU to the fact that I haven't gotten laid in six months, that sucks
3243829	3244950	Alright, Loki's turn.
3245550	3247072	Cause we're all keeping him quick tonight, yeah, yeah?
3249394	3253577	Um, let's see, well, F you to the stupid little kids, just everywhere.
3254443	3255243	Kill them while they're young.
3255984	3275073	Um, if it was a stupid slow-ass van that was in front of me on my way here, um, I understand that you like going 25 miles an hour in a 35, and the fact that all the people in your van are disabled, probably blind or deaf or something, um, you know, seriously, if I had any sort of, you know, rocker-propelled explosive, that van would be gone.
3275833	3282496	And, you know, I almost, I was almost tempted to push them into traffic, because I figure, you know, who's gonna miss them?
3282556	3283517	No one's gonna miss them, so...
3284663	3285204	F you to that.
3285744	3295232	And F you to my site for being stupid because FTP went link right and that sucked because all the files are down for like all day.
3296053	3297454	But I fixed that and that was cool.
3297774	3304160	And F you to me for having so much work because I'm like busy all the time and I can't enjoy anything.
3304997	3306658	Just work, work, work, work, work.
3309321	3311162	Oh, F you the gas prices because they suck.
3312103	3315226	I just know because all the gas station tenants are just jealous that we're bombing their country.
3315686	3317948	So, that's it.
3318348	3318649	I'm done.
3320630	3321131	Oh my god.
3323090	3324811	All right, I only got a few FUs.
3325252	3330736	One is to those people who get on the bus in the wheelchairs but manage to get up and walk when they get off the bus.
3331236	3337421	I always wondered, like, to some of these people who just look absolutely normal, if you push them out to traffic, I bet you anything they would get up and run.
3339403	3341925	They would leave the wheelchair at the middle of the road and get up and fucking run.
3343371	3345832	Another one is to my lack of concentration.
3346153	3357077	Today I almost full combo cancelled off Falling in Love on Light 7 on 2DX and I missed the last fucking note and so I almost killed the machine as I jumped up in circles.
3359251	3359351	What?
3359371	3359972	No, I have a mic.
3381533	3389803	Fuck you to the assholes that were getting in my way while I was trying to pass Daikin Kai Light yesterday at Country Club Lanes.
3390364	3391425	You couldn't pass it anyway.
3391945	3394228	No, I know, but still.
3395189	3399054	They're getting in my way, getting on the machine and giving me shit.
3401366	3402047	Thank you for watching!
3423177	3426099	And one of these days on the show, I'm just going to be myself and be nice.
3427440	3427960	Seriously.
3428480	3429861	Because I'm, like, a really nice person.
3430262	3431682	I mean, I'm a really nice person.
3431763	3433183	I just have, like, weird strangers.
3433203	3433484	Really?
3434344	3434744	I am!
3434825	3435605	I am nice!
3435845	3439367	You guys have all made me out to be, like, this crazy racist guy.
3440388	3440908	I'm not that person.
3440928	3442229	That's what you get for hanging out with Rob.
3442249	3442830	I love everybody.
3443210	3443550	Yeah.
3444191	3445251	Except that... Forget the porn addicts.
3445291	3447613	I love everybody except the disabled and stupid people.
3448133	3448473	Hey.
3451055	3452496	That would fall under stupid people.
3453343	3455804	Actually, disabled people are cool if they're smart.
3455964	3457065	It's just the stupid people I hate.
3457105	3458865	I hate stupid people all about.
3458886	3459506	Okay?
3461627	3462567	Yeah, I hate humanity.
3463407	3465128	Oh, well, I guess, you know, I can't win.
3467409	3469690	Fuck the shit I've been having and fuck being single.
3470190	3470531	Alright.
3475873	3481756	If you had Scandia still for nobody ever giving me my watch back still, it's been a week and I still don't have my watch back.
3482316	3482676	That's all.
3485663	3486624	Fuck you to cunt.
3487425	3488786	Fuck you to stupid people.
3488887	3491049	Fuck you to pussy everywhere.
3493171	3494132	And that's about it right now.
3494453	3500039	Yeah, and fuck you to big ass on the fucking sliding glass window.
3509895	3510695	Check, one, two.
3510935	3511575	Are we still up?
3511855	3512396	Check our level.
3512436	3513056	Yeah, we're going.
3513596	3513896	All right.
3514736	3516757	Give your F you one more time, Matt, because they're so great.
3516777	3520158	I said, fuck you to pussy and fuck you to cunt and just pussy everywhere.
3520238	3520958	Just fuck you.
3523818	3526439	Oh, yeah, I am stupid, people, but that kind of falls in the same category.
3527439	3528100	You've spickled.
3528240	3529680	Oh, okay.
3529820	3530440	Oh, you're too nice.
3532521	3533401	We don't like nice.
3533501	3533961	No, I'm just kidding.
3534665	3538386	and fuck you, the Oprah, because who are you trying to fool reading British lit?
3538506	3540307	Yeah, like you're reading British lit.
3554211	3556292	I'm talking loudly.
3556692	3560093	I think somebody's shooting a machine gun out front.
3560353	3562414	Yeah, we have firecrackers outside or something.
3563425	3564145	Jamie's going to run away.
3564185	3565546	I'm going to see if I hear a yell.
3565826	3566847	I'm going to see if she yells something.
3568408	3569288	Wait, hold on, hold on.
3569308	3570429	Somebody was knocking on the door.
3571550	3572230	Oh, bye-bye.
3572410	3572910	They're leaving?
3573311	3575051	Sunja and Johnny are leaving?
3575352	3576712	No, okay, Johnny's not leaving.
3580492	3582333	I gotta say, fuck book clubs.
3582373	3583713	You can say fuck book clubs.
3583793	3585494	I'm in a book club.
3585634	3586415	Fuck book clubs.
3586455	3587135	They're stupid.
3588736	3591917	Not Oprah's book club, but it's like Oprah's book club.
3591937	3599000	We need to take a moment so we can let some very special people say hi.
3599240	3601601	She eats books and craps cash.
3602522	3605463	Hi, this is Rick.
3606183	3606384	Hi.
3606764	3609045	And fuck you to Rick for never being around anymore.
3611820	3612740	My life's been good.
3612960	3613621	My week's been good.
3614421	3619544	So your life's good, so you can't say hi to us anymore?
3619564	3625027	I don't know, I've been poking around Scandia lately after work, but I get off work at 1.30, so... Oh, poopy.
3625227	3626948	So nobody gets to see me over there by myself.
3627248	3628728	You're just a mystery now.
3629329	3629629	I am?
3630369	3632550	Well, I mean, you know, because we don't see you.
3632570	3634772	You know what, I've really gone down in skill, too.
3634812	3639394	I mean, I was doing just a standard little one, and then all of a sudden my legs stopped working.
3639730	3641231	Me too, and I've gotten fat, see?
3641371	3641931	Uh-huh.
3643632	3644632	You're expecting to.
3644692	3645372	Yeah, I know.
3645972	3649114	So what do you want to say to all the listeners, the worldwide listeners of Orange Lounge Radio?
3650534	3652495	Play lots of DDR and try to lose your belly.
3653495	3655496	For God's sake, you're embarrassing yourself.
3655996	3656336	That's all.
3658897	3660938	We want to talk about embarrassing yourselves.
3660978	3662079	We saw this guy today.
3662139	3662879	Holy crap.
3663199	3665280	Did he suck ass at freestyle?
3666656	3668617	Man, he was just, like, getting up on their doubles.
3668657	3672620	He had no sense of, you know, coordination, balance, rhythm, or anything.
3672880	3675682	I don't even know why he was... I don't even know how he was able to do doubles to begin with.
3675702	3676663	Robin, I don't know anything about that.
3677163	3695495	He was just up there, like, doing his thing, like, holding the bar, and he tried jumping... Okay, first he started off his first song playing light, little, with no free zeros, and he jumped up over the bar, totally off cue, and totally missed the first step, nearly, like, broke his ankle.
3695655	3696356	It was hilarious.
3697538	3698400	Bye!
3698741	3699422	Bye!
3701306	3702569	Did you ever get to do your FUs, Nita?
3703651	3704453	I didn't really have an FU.
3705973	3707835	Why are all the women nice today except Jamie?
3707855	3708655	Jamie's always mean, though.
3708675	3709276	We expect that of her.
3709296	3712619	Yeah, my week's been going okay, so I guess I don't really have enough you.
3712639	3712679	Oh.
3713079	3714881	Have you always just made furniture?
3715681	3716622	Yes, okay.
3717603	3720946	Furniture made by what we assume to be communists.
3722447	3725970	Dude, it took like four hours to put a fucking desk together.
3726110	3728812	Yes, this desk, first of all, weighed like 200 pounds.
3730013	3730674	Just to carry it.
3731294	3734076	Yeah, it was a desk, a wooden desk, a computer desk.
3734176	3737177	Nothing worked right, nothing fit together the way it was supposed to.
3738078	3740499	Oh, and what about the drawer thing you're making now?
3740559	3741820	The drawers don't even fit right.
3741920	3746383	I'm putting together a four-dresser drawer that's got another six million pieces.
3746523	3746923	It sucks.
3747023	3747523	It's communist.
3747563	3750545	So fuck you to furniture that you have to put together.
3750565	3751586	How do you like my desk?
3751646	3752907	It has all these extra pieces.
3753827	3759292	You have to put each individual screw together.
3759312	3761053	A lot of screwing going on.
3761734	3764856	If anybody doesn't know what that's from, watch the Clerks cartoon.
3764916	3766237	It is the best VIG ever.
3769540	3770361	So that's it.
3770441	3772422	Anybody else have any fuck yous?
3774304	3775264	Give me microphone.
3776826	3778087	Time for puppy to bitch.
3779540	3780160	Hey, wait a minute.
3780401	3781521	Like a bitch is a dog?
3781962	3782202	Get it?
3782222	3782762	That's funny.
3783182	3783343	Yeah.
3783563	3783843	Shut up.
3785864	3786104	Okay.
3788246	3789647	Damn, why you gotta be such a bitch?
3791028	3791348	Shit.
3792068	3792929	Let me catch you.
3794670	3794950	Okay.
3796651	3800274	What the... Who the hell... Okay.
3801635	3802155	Okay, look out.
3802195	3802936	Jamie needs to get through.
3805197	3805998	Do your abs, Bobby.
3806318	3806558	Okay.
3808359	3809020	Uh, first of all...
3809810	3817998	Fuck, uh, I'd like to give a fuck you to my toilet in my bathroom, because the toilet seat broke a couple days ago, and now I cannot sit on it.
3818978	3821160	Given the term, I'm gonna cut your ass up in a whole new meeting.
3822902	3823663	Yes, indeed.
3824363	3832371	And then, uh, let's see, um, fuck the smell of weed, because it stinks, and it doesn't come out of carpeting very well.
3835260	3836881	I think you should use an umlaut.
3836902	3839904	I could do that, yes, but I was too lazy to try and figure out what key that is.
3865968	3867409	Now we get to the chatroom Zephius.
3867469	3868109	Has everyone gone?
3869469	3872810	Okay, first one comes from Japanman.
3874571	3876771	Fuck you little kids who get on when he plays Cool 7.
3877852	3879692	And fuck you people who don't like my baby mama.

3882073	3882733	Now who that is?
3882793	3883193	My baby mama.
3883213	3884534	We should play that during the next break.
3884574	3885474	Yes, but you need to play it.
3888191	3889112	Sorry, I'm killing JB.
3889132	3892895	The next one is from JB, or Justin Circuit in the name.

3910128	3910528	You know what?
3910568	3912129	There's a solution to that.
3912149	3913490	It's called Better Business Bureau.
3913530	3914091	You should write them.
3914111	3915472	That doesn't do shit.
3915652	3915912	I haven't...
3917634	3942991	I have an FU for my computer FU to Microsoft because their Windows XP thinks it wants to try to connect to the internet all the time even though I click the option that says do not connect to the internet and instead it's like oh I want to connect to the internet JB by the way talk to me later and I'll let you know how you can get them in legal trouble with the federal government Go frivolous lawsuits and tell them to suck your dick

3957926	3958687	What the fuck is that?
3959067	3963532	Yeah, but AAA, I don't have AAA and my friend's AAA let me unlock my car door when I let my keys in.
3964102	3964843	That is pretty cool.

3995682	3997744	Hi, Moohymer.
3997784	3998625	Hi, Moohymer.
3999485	4005089	And so now, fuck this dumbass lifeguard instructor bitch who looks and acts exactly like Phoebe from Friends.
4005309	4006270	Smelly cat!
4006630	4008151	Smelly cat!
4009792	4012755	She told us she had to go potty three times.
4014136	4015356	Was it number one or number two?
4015897	4017038	Yeah, she should have gone to the pool.
4017618	4018839	Maybe I'll be swimming in pee.
4019992	4024475	Fuck that feeling when you have 800 different food items in your house and you can't find the one unknown thing you're craving.
4025976	4027637	And... Aww.
4033201	4035563	And fuck gay people for not living near him and making him feel lonely.
4036443	4039005	You need to come to Frisco.
4039785	4042928	Next is Ness151.
4044569	4045829	Fuck DDR Coralville.
4046510	4047931	Because it's DDR crippled right now.
4050004	4051506	Next is Sautome Ranma.
4052006	4052747	Fuck you to dead air.
4052767	4053808	We don't have dead air.
4053848	4054909	I don't know what you're talking about.
4056950	4058252	It might be rebuffers or something.
4059012	4062796	But it's not us, because as far as I can see, we're still broadcasting just fine.
4063476	4065818	One problem with my microphone is that everyone here is going to have to do that.
4065838	4068100	Talk into the microphone and talk loudly.
4068140	4068581	Project.
4069141	4070503	Because... Oh, shut up.
4071864	4072745	La la la la.
4072865	4073185	Oh, anyway.
4073792	4078536	Um, yeah, and anyway, um, PsyQ of the Week goes to Hormones, enough said.
4078556	4083540	PsyQ of the Week goes to a DDR Extreme OST for apparently not being released.
4083720	4084721	They're not going to release it?
4085382	4086363	It's not going to be out for a while.
4086763	4087924	Um, however, talk to me later.
4089705	4091267	Um, SkylineDC505.
4091867	4093228	Yeah, we might be able to hook you up anyway.
4094109	4098713	F you to the California High School exit exam for making me come to school while three-fourths of the whole school got to sleep in.
4100003	4100523	You know what?
4100583	4102985	For the Alabama ones, they just gave it to us while we were in class.
4103105	4104466	There's an X exam now in high school?
4104486	4105846	And, like, I got a hundred on it.
4108708	4109649	I don't remember that.
4110109	4111089	Holy shit!
4112590	4113851	Snub dyspnoid.
4114631	4115312	Long F you.
4115632	4116252	Oh my god.
4116753	4120435	First off... First off... Hey, let me read!
4120555	4120975	Shut up!
4122034	4124135	First off, fuck driver's training school and the poop shoot.
4124776	4129759	I would honestly rather have a duck shit down my throat than to sit through that boring ass shit.
4129819	4130579	Everyone in the class.
4135302	4135822	This one was off.
4135842	4136543	We had a mic off.
4138178	4141140	Everybody, don't touch the on-off switch on the microphone.
4141160	4141720	Guys, we're sorry.
4141740	4143622	Okay.
4145643	4148865	And actually, then, we probably didn't get DCB's post.
4149045	4149305	Okay.
4156490	4157590	DCB, send me yours again.
4160112	4161853	What was the last thing you guys heard?
4163447	4165148	We didn't know what the chatroom, the last thing they heard.
4165168	4166408	I was reading the thank you, so I'm sorry.
4166728	4168129	Bitch, you did miss the whole big thing about 24.
4170549	4172390	Yeah, that's okay if you missed the whole thing about 24.
4172430	4172970	That was nothing.
4173030	4173910	Because we don't give a shit.
4174871	4175271	Sorry, Rob.
4175691	4175971	Okay.
4178232	4179032	Okay, then.
4179932	4180573	That's a while.
4181353	4181853	I'm sorry.
4183134	4184254	DCB, send me yours again.
4184830	4185130	There it is.
4185190	4187171	It just came in at the land there.
4187291	4189432	Fuck you to Photoshop7 for taking 7 minutes to load.
4189572	4191273	I'm sorry, Photoshop7 for taking 7 minutes to load.
4191553	4193394	Fuck his dad for buying lots of food and not letting him eat it.
4193434	4196715	And fuck you to the green card manager for telling him to get off the horse ride at MGL.
4198936	4199876	Brad, LankyStyle.
4200757	4201737	This fuck you goes to Racist.
4201817	4202617	I hate you all equally.
4202637	4203058	Thank you.
4207044	4208445	Next is Jazz.
4208505	4209105	Fuck school.
4209145	4209726	Die, die, die.
4210146	4212027	And I laugh at all the exit exam people.
4212387	4214689	They just started that this year, so I missed it by a year, so I laugh.
4214729	4218111	Ha, ha, ha, ha.
4218171	4226837	I thought they started the exit exams, like, last year, because I heard about it, that they were giving it out in my school, but I didn't have to take it.
4227037	4229559	By the way, it died at duck shit down the throat.
4229659	4230159	I'm sorry.
4230840	4234442	If you want to send me that again, but you did say fuckity, fuck, fuck, fuck, and fuck him up the nose hole.
4235177	4237619	Oh, we missed that whole thing with Snub Disanoids, FU?
4238079	4239059	We've been down that long?
4239820	4240220	Sorry.
4240280	4240920	Oh, that sucks.
4240940	4241621	I'm sorry, guys.
4242201	4246964	Send that again, because I nom- What you also missed is I nominated that as one of the top three FUs ever.
4247004	4247704	That was beautiful.
4253848	4256709	Okay, as long as they heard Fuck Em Up the Nosehole, that was the best.
4256890	4257130	Okay.
4257650	4259251	Um, Muhymer, Dead Air.
4261169	4263451	Okay, that ends our Fuck You's of the Week.
4263791	4265973	So to our Fuck You's of the Week, we say, fuck you.
4267033	4267514	Beautiful.
4267614	4268094	Break time?
4269295	4275079	When we come back from break, believe it or not, when we come back from break, I have big Bomani news.
4275139	4277921	It might be rumors, but I went and looked up news.
4278342	4281744	So, we're going to talk about Bomani.
4282164	4283866	We're going to talk about Bomani when we come back.
4283886	4286528	Believe it or not, on this show, we're going to talk about Bomani.
4295701	4296441	Yes, break time.
4297802	4300225	Come on forward dots.
4331391	4332712	Everybody to the limit, who's that?
4332752	4335154	It's to the limit, everybody come on, Fahogwa guys.
4336395	4337615	Come on, Fahogwa guys.
4338536	4343279	I see you jocking me, trying to play like you know me.
4344300	4346482	I'm like, come on, Fahogwa guys.
4346502	4348283	I said, come on, Fahogwa guys.
4348843	4352466	Everybody to the limit, the G is to the limit, everybody come on, Fahogwa guys.
4362235	4365896	I don't know who it is, but it probably is Fuhogwa Guys.
4366276	4370137	I asked my friend Joe, I asked my friend Jake, they said it was Fuhogwa Guys.
4370517	4374538	I said, come on, Fuhogwa Guys, I said, come on, Fuhogwa Guys.
4374558	4375998	Who's it to the limit?
4376018	4378819	Say me, I'm to the limit, everybody come on, Fuhogwa Guys.
4388490	4390594	Thanks for watching!
4428599	4430400	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4460778	4462339	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4512572	4513713	Thank you for watching!
4546668	4548058	Thanks for watching!
4573263	4574124	Thanks for watching!
4771414	4777137	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
4784727	4785448	Hi, we're back.
4785548	4791331	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and... By popular request, actually, we do need to give a mention of this.
4791912	4792372	Oh, what's this?
4792392	4795314	We're going to do... The F2 that everyone missed from Subdisfinoid.
4795674	4796935	Oh, that was so horrible.
4796975	4797456	Too bad about that.
4797476	4798536	Okay, let's hear it again.
4798696	4800778	First off, fuck driver's training in the poop chute.
4801018	4804480	I would honestly rather have a duck shit down my throat than to have to sit through that boring-ass shit.
4804540	4806261	Everyone in the class is a total bitch, even the teacher.
4806622	4808423	It's not like if you have a penis and testicles, I hate you.
4808443	4809884	I will smash your testicles because they're sensitive.
4809924	4811665	Bad men... Or men bad, I should say.
4811985	4813786	Respect women because we spit you out our baby holes.
4814207	4814467	Indeed.
4815187	4820909	Fuck driver's training only, fuck it so exclusively so that all of my horrible negative energy can be used to destroy driver's training forever.
4821969	4823410	That fucking school can suck my ass.
4823450	4826451	I haven't slept more than four hours each night this past week and I won't get enough sleep this week.
4826691	4828211	Fuck that bullshit, fuck it up the nose hole.
4828711	4829572	Yes, the nose hole.
4830052	4831812	But you missed the fuckity fuck fuck fuck.
4831852	4832573	That was the best.
4833353	4834153	Fuck fuckity fuck fuck.
4834253	4835294	Fuck you, you fucking fuck.
4835634	4836014	Yeah.
4836874	4837174	Alright.
4837254	4837474	Shit.
4837934	4839375	So, we wanted to do...
4841027	4844513	We wanted to do another song really fast, but it's something that Loki has to introduce.
4844553	4846316	And why is that, Mr. Loki?
4847798	4849241	It's another remix I did.
4850002	4852126	You know, it's not as good as my last one.
4852839	4857962	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4973737	4974299	Are we coming?
4974359	4975322	Into the dark, black forest.
5055469	5056510	That was pretty good.
5057171	5058172	I was really impressed with that.
5058192	5058712	That was pretty neat.
5058732	5059473	It was very subtle.
5059613	5064218	The modem stream probably doesn't do that justice because a lot of it's very subtle.
5064558	5064859	But...
5065799	5071102	But, as, okay, well we probably should go into SimCon news since this is SimCon news.
5072062	5084308	Um, okay, obviously SimCon news, the big news, well for me at least, is Leech from Loki 2.0 has finally, finally, two month delay launched.
5084929	5085029	Um.
5086049	5094417	It's got, right now, the initial update had the 2DX DWI project files for 2DX 2nd style through 5th style.
5095117	5099541	And so there's about, I'd say about 50-some files up there at the moment.
5099641	5103805	I'm uploading more probably later this week as I get to work on them.
5104385	5108008	I went ahead and... Oh man, that looks ugly on that.
5108288	5108669	Okay, anyways.
5108689	5109369	So...
5111978	5123848	I went ahead and, as promised, exclusive to Orange Launch Radio, if you're a wonderful listener of the show, you get access to a special page every week.
5124749	5131694	Now, I was kind of bad and didn't really hide the page well enough this time, but next time the files will be more hidden.
5131714	5132055	But anyways...
5132695	5142924	This page, exclusive to you guys, is going to be the release of my two remixes, The Legend of Trance and the Dark Black Forest Midnight Angel mix.
5143764	5156455	And so, to access this page, what you want to do is go to my site, which is www.willddrforfood.net slash leechfromloki.com
5157432	5175080	and then what you want to do once you get to that and you want to type in also the special HTML page which is going to be hotmonkeysex.html and that will bring you up to the wonderful page with my two links for my MP3s.
5175140	5178282	It's a secret page and what are the special MP3s that they can download this week?
5178422	5183164	The Legend of Trance which is a remix of The Legend of Max which is just fucking awesome.
5183904	5185365	That's my favorite remix so far.
5186225	5192811	and that's Legend of Trance, Loki vs. ZZ featuring Sundecade.
5193151	5199576	Then we have the Dark Black Forest, Midnight Angel mix, Steve Reiner vs. Loki featuring Sonaris.
5200897	5208804	So those are exclusive remixes to Orange Lounge listeners and we just posted the link in the chat room if you didn't get it and so go leech away and you can listen to those.
5208824	5211246	But don't listen to them now, wait until after the show because we need our listeners.
5211366	5212507	Yeah, so we'll have...
5214318	5226744	Well, as far as DWIs going, you know, for Legend of Trance, as mentioned on the page, I'm thinking about that one for Tourney Mix 4, so that'll be that one, but Dark Black Forest, Midnight Angel Mix is up for grabs, so.
5227824	5230085	It's just a steady 140 BPM.
5230165	5236748	In other words, you're basically saying, you can't, or basically you're telling the listeners, don't do a DWI for Legend of Trance, because you claim it for Tourney Mix 4.
5236788	5238689	You peed on it and made it your territory.
5240269	5240929	Exactly.
5241310	5246151	Alright, well, speaking of your mixes, how about something that was your choice?
5247231	5248431	How about the, uh, Cage Matches?
5248451	5249552	You wanna do that?
5249572	5249712	Okay.
5249732	5250372	Let's do Cage Match.
5250752	5250992	Alright.
5251572	5256173	Alright, um, I don't have Holic, I have Holic, but it won't play a background because of my stupid sound card.
5256273	5257033	Fuck my sound card!
5257073	5257954	You sound like Hee-Haw.
5257974	5259154	Not like, Ah, Mamie Pearl, this is Hee-Haw!
5270448	5282535	But no, we're going to go ahead and play, basically the way that our cage match works is that each of us picks a song, and one of us will have won the previous week, so that's the song that should be in rotation right now, but really isn't right now.
5282555	5285897	It isn't right now, but we'll figure it out.
5285917	5289400	We'll put them both in or something, the last week's winner, unless it wins again, which it may.
5289560	5291241	It may win again, but I don't think it will.
5291841	5293501	I don't like it.
5293521	5294982	I think it stunk.
5320780	5323984	Don't let us influence you, or better yet, just let me influence you.
5325126	5327068	So we're just going to play a clip of last week's winner, right?
5327489	5331654	Yeah, I'll play a decent-sized clip of it, because I actually have Life Out 3.
5333256	5334998	This is, what was that track again?
5335018	5335819	Sasha with Expander.
5335859	5337041	Sasha with Expander.
5337361	5338022	This is last week's winner.
5380504	5383687	That was a little bit of an expander.
5384288	5386430	Anyway, this is Rob's pick of the week.
5386650	5387371	You want to tell us about it?
5387511	5389013	Actually, we should rate that song.
5389113	5389533	It's cool.
5389733	5390334	I give it a 7.
5390554	5391595	No, we don't do last week's.
5391695	5392276	We don't do last week's.
5392777	5392997	Usually.
5393197	5394578	Because we already ranked it last week.
5394658	5394879	Alright.
5395473	5398374	And we said it shouldn't win, and it did, because our chatroom hates us.
5398834	5402115	Okay, my song, and I had to kind of come up with this at the last minute.
5402155	5408777	This really isn't what I would have usually picked, but I completely forgot that, like, hi, we're moving the show tonight, so I actually have to burn a CD off my song.
5409077	5412118	But luckily I have a CD in my car, and this is actually a pretty good song.
5412618	5415419	And I got turned on to this song a couple years ago because I...
5416451	5418172	Tell me a fable, a fable Tell me a fable
5443037	5454644	Tell me a fake, tell me the fake one A fake, tell me the fake one Talk to me, tenderly, so reality and fantasy Will meld together, only in one thing
5471221	5473702	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
5633326	5634589	Thanks for watching!
5657366	5658087	Tell me a fable.
5658127	5658427	A fable.
5658627	5659047	A fable.
5659167	5660609	A fable that will never end.
5660729	5661489	And now, I dream.
5661529	5662050	Dream.
5686013	5687054	Thanks for watching!
5814246	5816668	That was Robert Miles of Fable.
5817249	5819170	The big plop at the end is the best.
5819771	5822333	As far as my opinion of that song, he's done better.
5822974	5823955	So it gets a six.
5830160	5831502	Microphones are going every which way.
5834195	5835215	The song is alright.
5835636	5836996	Yeah, like, he could have done better.
5837336	5840077	But, um, Ever After really sucked ass.
5840958	5843159	So, uh, that's gonna affect my decision.
5843999	5845139	Um, I'm gonna have to give it a 6.
5849581	5850822	That song rocks and you don't, 10.
5852922	5855203	Oh, wow, that's a real biased opinion there.
5856124	5859185	Um, I have a really bad experience with that movie.
5859725	5861466	And, honestly... Care to explain?
5862879	5865039	Go there with the chick who cheats on you and gets pregnant.
5865480	5866520	That's all I gotta say.
5867820	5868360	Seriously.
5868420	5869540	It's about the song, not the movie.
5869720	5872961	I know, that's why I just said, people tell me to explain.
5873341	5878662	No, honestly, I really didn't like that song, so I'll give it like a four.
5879743	5881923	And that's being really, really, really nice.
5884784	5889225	For those people that are listening, Rob's just giving raspberries to Zero right now.
5889665	5890565	Many times.
5892597	5894817	I don't know, I think it's nice.
5896238	5901859	Honestly, that song would put me to sleep if I weren't in here talking to other people right now.
5902699	5902999	Three.
5905019	5905359	Six.
5905459	5908120	I could probably see it in, like, Keyboard Mania or something.
5908920	5910780	Okay, I like that song, okay?
5910920	5913721	So, I have a new FU to all of you bitches in here.
5914981	5917781	I give that song a ten, because that's, like, my kind of song.
5918041	5918541	I liked it.
5919141	5919582	Damn right!
5922668	5923528	I'd have to give it like a 9.
5924329	5927790	It's a pretty good song, I like it, yeah.
5928610	5933692	I like any trance just about, so I mean, soft, hard, anything.
5940234	5942375	Okay, I'll say that again, I'd give that song a 9.
5943695	5946136	It's not perfect, but it's pretty damn good.
5948277	5954899	Alright, well, I'd have to give it a 7, because I heard a DJ Epic version that's about, like, that's twice as good as that.
5954999	5955599	So, I'll give it a 7.
5957719	5960540	So, the average score is, and remember, I'm not very good at math, 9.
5961120	5966401	So... Okay.
5967282	5968022	It's my turn now.
5969462	5975684	Um, I don't know who did this, because I downloaded it by accident one day, but this is Link's theme, Heave Dance Remix.
5976024	5976364	Here you go.
5986252	5986893	Thanks for watching!
6029837	6030498	Thanks for watching!
6060905	6061525	Thanks for watching!
6102631	6111976	Okay, I know it's not the best and I didn't put it in there with an intention of winning, but when I first downloaded it, it made me really bouncy and hyper, so I give it a seven.
6114337	6114918	I'll go ahead.
6115578	6120441	Like, when I'm listening to that, I bounce up and down a lot, and then I want to take a really big shit.
6122161	6124843	So, I give it eight rolls of toilet paper.
6128715	6130656	Okay, um, let's see here.
6131216	6132816	Uh, let's see here, it violated so many rules.
6133016	6133776	What's a speed mix?
6133816	6135857	And speed mixes all suck ass.
6136497	6136817	Okay?
6137077	6140738	Two, if... What the hell, they make it with mod trackers, some shit like that?
6140778	6142159	Sounds like it's eight years old.
6142699	6145720	Fucking, the song had no... Oh, it had big bass.
6145760	6147380	People like big bass, I'll put big bass in there.
6147580	6149221	Okay, drum beats, drum beats sound good.
6149381	6150361	Let's throw those in there, too.
6150381	6152301	Oh, and let's get a MIDI of Link's theme.
6152461	6153042	We'll put that there.
6153302	6154562	Look, I made a remix!
6154842	6155382	Woohoo!
6155402	6156182	Look at me go!
6156743	6157963	I got a big bass, wanna come over?
6161681	6169503	So, um, yeah, I'm gonna have to give that, like, a two, and, uh, and Robert Miles' song, well, is better now.
6169843	6178545	Having, having, having, you know, it's like, it's like if you have the ugly chick and you stand next to her and it makes you look better, that's what this song was.
6178645	6180125	This song was the ugly chick.
6181886	6184686	And the rest of the group moans and groans with that comment.
6185887	6188247	Oh, come on, is, was it really that bad?
6188407	6188687	Yes.
6190448	6190968	Uh, eight.
6192478	6196421	I... Oh, come on, Loki could do better than that.
6197202	6199183	Anyways, uh... Yeah.
6199804	6200164	I like it.
6200264	6200865	It's short!
6201265	6201705	It's short.
6201725	6202786	That's the good thing about this song.
6202826	6203226	It's short.
6203286	6204067	It doesn't drag out.
6204567	6205748	I give it an 8.5.
6207510	6210052	Okay, so I like the fact that it was bouncy.
6210072	6210872	It was bouncy.
6211092	6212473	So there's a couple of points there.
6213074	6217537	And it had Link's theme, which... A couple of other points, but other than that, it sucked ass.
6217577	6218018	I'm giving it a 2.
6219292	6220133	Real, real, real quick.
6220473	6222714	If it's going that fast, how the fuck are you going to dance to that?
6223534	6225836	Woo, it's fast, I mean, I mean.
6225856	6231159	I know, it's a little fast, a little too bouncy, a little too happy, happy.
6231399	6233080	I don't think I like it that much.
6233120	6238283	I give it like a seven or a six, but I give Loki's commentary a ten.
6238663	6239403	I love that.
6239824	6244046	Okay, I just want to say really fast, though, Loki, you don't dance to it, you have sex to it.
6245413	6247694	I just don't want to tell Dan that Rob did humping motions in his chair.
6273655	6279020	You know, I say, if the FUs were still going, I would say fuck you to all who gave it lower than at least a 7.
6279701	6282543	Cause, if you don't have any, like, $8,000... Well, the fuck yous are over.
6283324	6284064	Fuck you, buddy.
6284905	6285806	Fuck you, too!
6286767	6289029	Okay.
6289349	6290470	Here's an idea, okay?
6290650	6291191	Here's an idea.
6292412	6295034	I've heard better Final Fantasy remixes, okay?
6295375	6299999	Better Final Fantasy remixes, they need to just do a decent remix of it, then we'll give it a decent score.
6300751	6302392	Alright, well let's just go ahead and get voting out of the way.
6302412	6305355	We're going to play a little bitty clip to the songs one more time.
6305815	6306296	Name them all.
6306736	6309138	We're going to name them all, and here's like a little bit of it.
6309638	6311400	This one is Sasha with Expander.
6313281	6314202	Okay, that's enough.
6326963	6330605	Next one is Robert Miles with Fable.
6331285	6332506	Yay.
6335808	6339409	Okay, that's enough of that.
6339770	6340550	And then Link's theme.
6343191	6343992	Okay, that's enough of that.
6344912	6345272	Vote!
6345673	6346093	Vote now!
6347077	6351699	In the meantime, we're going to hand the microphone to Loki to go angst on us again while I pull up the next sub break.
6352140	6356782	Well, I'm going to do Bimani News because we promised it like an hour ago and we never did it.
6356842	6369709	So you've all been sitting there getting moist, your panties have been getting moist in anticipation of this hot, hot... I can't believe puppy just said that.
6369769	6370469	Say that again.
6370909	6372290	Things dried up by now.
6372610	6373351	Now they're crusty.
6374807	6377543	God, things I did not need to know
6378781	6381363	I am stealing this news.
6381383	6384265	I will quote my source because a lot of people don't.
6384285	6387127	I was just surfing around the net during one of the weeks and I found this news.
6387547	6390009	It was posted on the LiveJournal community for Bomani.
6390249	6392770	So it's just username Bomani on the LiveJournal community.
6393351	6395052	LiveJournal.com slash tilde Bomani.
6395092	6399695	And by the way, I'll take this opportunity to plug that Orange Lounge also has a LiveJournal community.
6399715	6403898	So if you go to LiveJournal.com slash tilde Orange Lounge, there's our community.
6404158	6408521	So if you use LiveJournal, add us to your friends list because we like it when people add us to their friends list.
6408781	6413448	I had a live journal once, then I never posted, and they got rid of it for me.
6424574	6424934	Here we go.
6425054	6426335	I'm not a racist, bastard.
6426395	6426716	Here we go.
6427336	6432500	This was, I'm going to credit, and actually I think this person's on the Orange Lounge community, which makes them that much cooler.
6432520	6436683	This was posted by Hata, H-A-T-A, maybe that's Hata or something.
6437003	6437544	Yeah, Hata.
6437804	6438784	It looks like Hata to me.
6440686	6441847	She's also in our community, too.
6442611	6443672	2DX Night Style Location Test
6459768	6465792	So, again, I don't know how reliable this news source is, take it with a grain of salt, but this is just all in fun, right?
6466333	6471376	So, finally, Konami will launch the location test for Bomani 2DX 9th Style on May 5th.
6471797	6475039	We have rumors saying that this is going to be the last installment.
6475539	6476980	But it has not been confirmed yet.
6477300	6479902	On the official site, they announced a few songs that will be brought back.
6479962	6480963	However, that is not all.
6481283	6485166	We all know that Beatmania has closed its history last year with the release of Beatmania the Final.
6485466	6486367	It was not over yet.
6486427	6489189	They are also bringing back some songs that was on Beatmania.
6489509	6499757	The songs include LED Hellscaper, Tack with Release Your Mind, Pink Pong with Pink Dream, The Bald Head, Ska Go Go, DJ Naguro with Miriam featuring Believe Again.
6500597	6504199	Just to name a few, I'm pretty sure that some of those songs would be remixed by our favorite artists.
6504259	6510561	Due to massive resurrection of classic Beatmania songs, it is possible that they may have to take out many 2DX songs as well.
6511262	6511582	Uh-oh.
6512382	6513883	Of course, we will have new songs.
6514063	6517744	We will have new songs brought to us by DJ Taka, Tak, Ram, and many other familiar names.
6517784	6527629	Some songs that would definitely catch our heart include Taka with Natural Principle, Aya with Death Wind, Tak with Irrational, Yamato with X-49,
6529202	6531585	and Akira Yamaoka with Electric Wave.
6531605	6533747	First of all, I went to Tac's site and Irrational's not on there.
6535029	6536951	Ah, so maybe... No, it's Tac.
6537051	6537731	It says Tac here.
6537792	6538432	Tac with Irrational.
6538532	6543898	I also scoured several of my downloading places and I haven't found that anywhere.
6544759	6546641	So, might be a little bit of bullshit, but there you go.
6547282	6550005	So, what do you guys think about 2DX9's style possibly being the last?
6551721	6552481	Fuck you, Konami.
6553141	6554002	I don't think they would do that.
6554022	6555682	I'm sorry, but that series makes way too much money.
6555842	6557283	Yeah.
6557403	6568487	Even with as rare as some machines are in here in the US, it could make a lot more money here if Konami in Japan paid attention, but I'm sure as popular as it is in Japan, they wouldn't cut it off now.
6568507	6571868	Just don't let 2DX get in the hands of Konami of America.
6571888	6572588	Holy crap.
6572708	6574309	Oh god, that's a scary thought!
6576769	6580330	Unless they're going to give us 9-key 2DX or something, I don't know.
6580390	6581130	That'd be weird.
6582331	6585012	But then it'd be Poppin' DX!
6585272	6589713	Resurrect, freaking, what was it, Kraken DJ.
6590773	6592593	Kraken DJ's the shit, I like that game a lot.
6592914	6596434	Anybody else want to say anything about Night Style, Night Style being the last things they want to see on Night Style?
6597615	6598535	I don't know, more Taka.
6600035	6601336	If this were the last 2DX...
6603346	6608870	Say if they do a Beatmania 4, a fourth series or whatever, what do you think they should do in it?
6609931	6612373	I was actually talking about this earlier today with Zero.
6612493	6620019	I was saying that they should add, much like Beatmania 3 had the foot pedal effector thing, which didn't do shit, Crossfader.
6620940	6622761	Like we were talking about, what was it we were talking about?
6623481	6626784	Oh, Healing Vision Angelic, where that one part where it's just all din-din-din-din.
6627044	6628785	Have that be like a Crossfader part on there.
6629326	6629906	Something like that.
6629926	6630287	I don't know.
6630387	6632008	A little bit more elaborate.
6634086	6636607	I was thinking also, you know, like in Keyboard Mania, how you have the wheel?
6637367	6638327	Something like that.
6639128	6640248	Yeah.
6641128	6642008	Here's my suggestion.
6642028	6644129	This is the same thing they need to do to DDR.
6644369	6648330	Like when they bring DDR to a new series, if they're going to do a DDR 2DX or whatever.
6649831	6655612	They need to do a... Well, Freeze Notes is one thing, because Easy to DJ has that, but it's kind of overrated.
6655632	6658953	Beatmania, the final, does have the full rotational... They do have that.
6659073	6659594	It's pretty cool.
6659754	6660694	They haven't done that in 2DX yet.
6661904	6665427	I would suggest some kind of more elaborate battle mode.
6665607	6669791	Like, imagine if they had the thing in Disney's Rave to 2DX.
6670031	6673274	That would be cool.
6673314	6674375	Yes, exactly.
6676277	6677698	I mean, they have all these characters.
6679212	6681833	That they don't use anymore because they're the total background.
6682133	6688454	I think the new versions of DDR and 2DX need to have more competitive modes, because DDR's always been a co-op game till now.
6688474	6690234	They need freakin' Dance Battle again.
6690334	6692115	Yeah, if it were... That was the second mix.
6692175	6698256	Exactly, if it had more, if it elaborated a little more on competition, like, I think it would be a kick-ass game.
6698296	6702517	Well, actually, what I would like to see again is an actual, another Link version.
6704552	6706815	I think that would be a really good idea.
6707336	6710280	So you think maybe it's coincidence they're ending DDR and 2DX at the same time?
6711862	6712563	To bring them back?
6712623	6715607	It's this big, substream resurrection?
6715627	6716108	Maybe, I don't know.
6716509	6718071	Maybe, maybe not.
6718609	6720309	You know what I'd like to see?
6720349	6725451	I'd like to see Beat Mania's song selections on DDR.
6725871	6730552	Just get rid of all that shit that they're ripping from like Dance Mania, like all these speed mixes.
6730973	6736174	Anything from Wild Side, I say the Dance Mania stuff is the best stuff in DDR.
6736354	6736954	It always is.
6738055	6739635	A little, sometimes not.
6741699	6744424	As in the Queen songs that they horribly rape and destroy.
6744464	6746067	The most freestyling songs.
6746288	6748452	Always the most freestyling songs out of anything in DDR.
6749406	6757229	So you're saying that you would rather take Scenarius Speedy Mix versus The Sound of Goodbye or Never Look Back.
6757249	6759449	But Sound of Goodbye and Never Look Back are licensed songs as well.
6759529	6760250	Fly Away.
6760570	6762210	Those are all licensed songs you're naming.
6762250	6763271	They're not Konami originals.
6763291	6764231	They're all licensed songs.
6764331	6765011	Alright, fine.
6765071	6767012	General Relativity, 19 November.
6767772	6769273	How about Wow Wow 70s?
6769293	6772754	I'm not saying to get rid of those, but don't get rid of the Dance Meeting stuff because that's some of the best stuff.
6772774	6773574	What am I talking about?
6773614	6775415	Anyway, say just fuck up the steps in the first place.
6775435	6775835	Exactly.
6778160	6781021	Yeah, most of the Dance We Need stuff is fine, but I got one word for you.
6781381	6781782	Joga.
6783963	6784303	Okay.
6785663	6786644	I got one word for you.
6786924	6788325	I got one word for you, bitch.
6788485	6789165	Politary.
6789645	6792066	No, Joga, also known as Ban For More's Lounge.
6792406	6797729	Because they do nothing but the same damn song every time.
6798385	6800327	Oh god, Loki just said he wants to make a remix.
6800387	6801428	Please do a Joker remix.
6801488	6802369	Please, please, please.
6802389	6804551	Rob, by the way, I've warned you, that's the trap chair.
6804591	6804991	Don't fall.
6805692	6807013	Rob almost fell out of it again.
6807053	6808455	That's like the second time in five minutes.
6809721	6816545	You know, one thing I like about Extreme is how you're seeing more music that you wouldn't expect to see on DDR at all.
6816966	6827973	I would hope to see that, like, even if they did have, like, a next version or whatever, or didn't, I would just hope that they would, like, keep going with the evolution of music that they're finally doing in Extreme.
6828733	6836158	Like, how they have, like, rock beat music and they actually have real stuff instead of all that same annoying crap that they had from the past.
6836218	6840361	Yeah, like, uh, We Are The Champions, because that song's just played so much.
6840901	6846405	I mean, I can't tell you how many times I tell people, stop playing We Are The Champions, keep hearing that song over and over.
6849247	6851208	They took Queen and made it gay.
6851548	6854330	And for the record, I play that song.
6855671	6857012	And for the record, Queen was gay.
6858800	6860100	I know that, dammit!
6861081	6863101	But the music wasn't until that.
6863121	6865642	I think we just made JB have a cry because it's SyFam.
6865882	6867602	Ice Queen, by the way, just got a zing with that.
6869503	6872423	Even still, you know, there's better stuff that's come from SyFam.
6872664	6874264	Look at freaking DDR USA.
6874284	6876064	I mean, those songs were awesome.
6876605	6878585	You know, Take It To The Morning Light, you know.
6881766	6882166	Yeah!
6883362	6886547	Seriously, we are the champions!
6887008	6888951	Ooh, na-na-na-na-na, yeah!
6890354	6892497	DarkBlackForest, I mean, that was awesome.
6893018	6894741	Ooh, and Sandstorm!
6896266	6897547	We can rave!
6898147	6898628	You know what?
6899108	6900909	I think we're going to probably have to take a break.
6901650	6903331	I have one more story that needs to be read.
6903471	6904051	Needs to be read.
6904091	6905852	Because actually some people were alluding to this.
6906133	6907253	I'm sorry, what were we saying?
6907313	6908274	We have to also tally the votes.
6908294	6908914	Yeah, we have to tally the votes.
6908934	6909655	We'll do that during the break.
6910496	6913037	But I have to read this news.
6913117	6919922	And now, again, as with the last story, as with the last story, take this as a rumor.
6920522	6921783	Take this as a rumor.
6922103	6922363	Okay?
6922484	6925726	It's just a rumor until we know more about it.
6926746	6931630	Konami of Japan told that they are thinking about introducing Beatmania 2DX to the USA.
6932631	6938876	After gaining so much popularity by their release of DDR USA Mix, they said they are considering the release of the 2DX series as well.
6938896	6942198	The Konami of Japan says DDR USA was a big success.
6942498	6948283	The number of players is still increasing and we also get several emails asking if we are going to release the American version of 2DX.
6949183	6951125	Konami of America is excited about this as well.
6951205	6954868	One of the spokesmen said the DJ scene is probably more popular in America than Japan.
6957329	6967413	I am sure that the game will catch the heart of both real DJs Not yet, Loki And the people who want to be one So, want to be a DJ?
6967433	6969894	Just start playing 2DX That's exactly what they're saying here
6973135	6976778	The music is great for audience, too, and I don't see why this can't be a success.
6976898	6982321	It is rumored that the new machine will be revealed at E3 2003.
6982982	6984603	Depending on the schedule, it might be postponed to 2004.
6985824	6986384	I wanna go!
6986944	6987885	Nope, nope, not done yet.
6988125	6993429	Unlike DDR, instead of the home controller, the entire machine will be brought in and it will be on free play.
6993949	6998015	They are also thinking about bringing guest players from Japan to show us how the game is played.
6998316	7000358	That's where I start to think the story is bullshit.
7000519	7001720	I think the story is bullshit right there.
7002021	7004064	I want to see DJ Lee too.
7004104	7006768	Well, you know, that would be cool and all, but they don't need to do that.
7006908	7009491	There's very good players here locally that they could get.
7010132	7012154	I mean, when I say locally, I mean California.
7012594	7014175	They don't acknowledge any of those people.
7014215	7017037	I mean, hello, look at DropTheBombSystemSMF.
7017137	7018058	Six foot!
7018278	7019779	Oh my god, not six feet!
7019899	7021540	I'm talking about bringing in the players and stuff.
7021560	7022661	That's what they did last year, D2.
7022681	7023722	They had all US players.
7024242	7025223	I know Mel was down there.
7025323	7030407	It would make sense that they would use local players if they know that there's a local scene.
7030967	7033529	Well, anyway, let me finish and Loki can give the rest of his comments.
7034089	7040173	One more exciting news about this is that they will have some songs that's only featured on the USA version of 2DX only.
7040553	7042634	However, it may not satisfy some expert players.
7042794	7044856	This is going to be the first release of 2DX in America.
7044876	7048218	It may be aimed at beginner players so they can get into the game easily.
7048258	7056243	It's possible that the new features included like the beginner mode in DDR USA, possibly similar to the drill mode that's featured in 2DX 5th, 6th homestyle version.
7056623	7059825	This might be a good chance for people who live outside of California to try this game out.
7060986	7061286	All right.
7061686	7062527	Have at it, Loki.
7062667	7069431	I'm actually going to take those to a source and see if I can find any legitimacy, but I doubt that it is.
7070372	7072753	We'll find out, but just take it with a grain of salt.
7072773	7073814	That's a new story going around.
7073834	7074475	We're going to report it.
7076016	7076316	Okay.
7077276	7077717	The only...
7078883	7084586	The only way this is going to work is if they actually do a good job on this and pick good music for this.
7085947	7092810	However, looking at Konami of America's past track record, it's not looking good, folks.
7093230	7094571	It's not looking good at all.
7095091	7098333	I think they're going to take 2DX and go, you know what?
7098773	7106657	I think these players haven't played the Japanese songs, so let's take a bunch of stuff from first style, and then we're going to take a shit on it, and then we're going to add some new songs too.
7107137	7108678	I'm going to disagree.
7109078	7115421	Because if they don't try to do this, we're going to do it on a learning curve.
7115441	7119262	We're going to start easy with DDR USA, and then we're going to go to Canomics, and then we're going to go to Max USA.
7119302	7123724	Which Max USA, if that had been the first one, we would never have people bitching.
7123764	7126245	People would have been happy with that, and you know what?
7126325	7128246	People wouldn't bitch about how Konami messes it up.
7129449	7130150	You know what, Konami?
7130170	7136034	What you need to do, even though you want to milk the sales, if you want to keep the fans happy, put it all encompassing into one game.
7136094	7137635	Something that the beginners can pick up.
7137755	7141158	Have your beginner mode, but have those and others that will murder us too.
7141238	7142839	The expert stuff and good songs.
7143420	7144300	Well, not just Light Seven.
7144340	7146942	I'm talking like the beginner one, two, where every song is one star.
7147142	7148343	The Japanese ones have that.
7148383	7148924	No one complains.
7148964	7149484	It's pretty nice.
7149564	7150525	It helps you learn how to play.
7151165	7151626	Do that.
7151746	7156009	Don't just, don't give us a game that's only the one, two, and three stars or people are going to bitch.
7156664	7157204	That would be ugly.
7157224	7159586	If you want to learn how to play, Light 7, leave it there.
7160106	7161887	Keep your Light 7, keep your 7 key.
7162448	7164509	That way you have room for people to get better.
7165069	7165790	Let's just put it this way.
7165890	7170613	You put Vincent DeMora's Eternity on there, I don't care what the fuck you do with it, you can put big gay-ass...
7172480	7185673	Hello, this is DJ Spanky, saying everybody should play 2DX USA.
7186574	7187895	I endorse this fully.
7188515	7192980	It has such wonderful songs in it, like Justify My Love by Madonna.
7194632	7199934	So Mr. Spanky, does the nice booming subwoofer make you feel special?
7201434	7204715	This is what I would suggest you do when 2DX comes to the USA.
7205135	7208596	Get your subwoofer and mount it really high so it comes up to the bar.
7208896	7211097	Then when you play, straddle the subwoofer.
7211177	7215598	It's much funner.
7218859	7220019	It'll make your balls bounce.
7224770	7228132	Okay, that was a little too much information.
7231394	7232274	And the room falls silent.
7232995	7237077	I think that we should go to break while we tally the votes for Cage Match, which actually I've already done.
7237537	7248383	But we'll go to break, we'll play a few songs, especially one by request, and then we'll announce the winner for the Cage Match, which I tabulated while Noah was looking.
7249804	7252806	Anyway, yeah, here you go.
7274122	7274926	Thanks for watching!
7320306	7321986	If I can't get a D, round down to a D
7367088	7368131	Thanks for watching!
7395677	7396339	Thanks for watching!
7509447	7509509	and
7595621	7596244	Thank you for watching!
7670345	7671986	Thank you for watching!
7705013	7707454	Lyrics, Lyrics, Lyrics, Lyrics
7764761	7771627	Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
7772348	7778474	But hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to, and still the fun is just as great.
7778794	7780696	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
7781276	7785661	Kick it with me, and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
7786761	7789122	That's one of some of my regular guests.
7789862	7793304	Miss Starmelby, who we saw yesterday at Derby Owner's Crack.
7793604	7794224	That was a lot of fun.
7794725	7795345	He's good people.
7795825	7800647	Well, anyway, we're going to go ahead and make the announcement then of... Oh, shit, I actually deleted all their songs.
7800827	7801588	I'll have to find it again.
7801968	7803789	Well, we're not even going to play it.
7803809	7811492	Yeah, anyway, the winner is, by a pretty big vote, is the Zelda mix.
7811512	7811993	Goodie, goodie.
7812053	7813893	Not a damn person voted for Fable.
7813913	7814834	You people made me cry.
7816417	7817418	You people made me laugh.
7818478	7824101	I laughed with Jamie.
7825041	7826662	God, I thought my cackling was bad.
7826702	7828163	I thought Ice Queen's cackling was bad.
7828283	7828543	Jesus.
7830624	7834206	Alright, so what we got to do now though, we're going to set up for a list list.
7834226	7835546	We're going to do a list list tonight, right?
7835726	7835966	Yes.
7836166	7837307	And what is the list list topic?
7837667	7838848	Tonight's list list topic is...
7840137	7842339	What mocap game do we want to see?
7842799	7847984	You've had mocap boxing, mocap golf, and now what should the next mocap game be?
7848605	7850186	What would we want to see here in the studio?
7850486	7851487	That's tonight's list list.
7852028	7855110	So can we cue up a quick song to give us time to think?
7855150	7856371	I'm going to do a few songs.
7857072	7863117	Just do like, maybe like, we hate to play so many songs in a row, but we just need the time to think here.
7863558	7867081	So we're going to do like maybe one or two quick songs, and then we'll be back.
7868641	7870582	Okay, we're going to do just a couple quick songs.
7872724	7873704	Play the Legend of Trance.
7873764	7875505	You want to do Legend of Trance?
7875905	7877106	I got an overwhelming response.
7877867	7881249	Okay, so we're going to do Legend of Trance and we'll come back and do mocap.
7883810	7884911	Alright, we're loading it up.
7886331	7897160	Okay, so if you haven't downloaded it yet, the secret website so you can get to this is willddrforfood.net slash leechfromloki, and that's the secret page where you can download these songs.
7897180	7900022	Well, the show never contained hot monkey sex, so now... Now it does.
7900803	7901063	Yeah.
7901843	7902084	So.
7902664	7903064	Enjoy.
7903084	7904946	So we're going to play Legend of Trance?
7905246	7905446	Yes?
7906087	7906907	If we can get it?
7906927	7907368	Do-do-do-do-do!
7908792	7920294	So, it's with an L. Unfortunately, not everybody in the studio is going to be able to help with listless tonight, but we'll let them break any ties we have, which we usually do to people who... What?
7920814	7921434	It's not working.
7921834	7922154	Okay.
7922174	7922915	What do you mean?
7923235	7925915	We're having technical difficulties, so we're trying again.
7925935	7927775	What do you mean it's not reading the CD?
7928015	7929896	In the meantime... That's the CD.
7935557	7936637	What else were we talking about during the break?
7941590	7941971	Okay.
7946835	7947515	We're looking for that.
7947555	7947896	There it is.
7947996	7948896	Okay, yay, we got it.
7948956	7952079	So we're going to play Legend of Trance and prepare our list list and we'll be right back.
7952900	7954001	You are listening to Orange Launch Radio.
8120501	8122402	Okay, we are back and we're ready.
8122503	8123423	We're going to do the list list.
8123443	8123824	Here we go.
8124384	8129888	So, the way this list works, in case you're a new listener to the show, what we're going to do, we're all going to name our top three.
8129928	8136433	We have six people in studio participating, the three hosts, Intern Zero, Puppy, and DarkTest Studio are all participating tonight.
8136473	8137353	Top three mo-cap games.
8137373	8139695	By the way, for the record, mo-cap stands for motion capture.
8140316	8140896	Yes, very good.
8140916	8143938	And you may have seen games like mo-cap, boxing, golf.
8144219	8146040	And another one, Tsuguri, which is the sword game.
8146383	8146783	Very good.
8147564	8158789	Also, if you've never, if you've policed 9-1-1's kind of a mocap game, you can kind of count Parapara, whatever, you know, if you've never seen an actual mocap game, those are kind of rough estimates of what it is.
8158809	8160430	It basically uses a sensor for your movement.
8160470	8160971	Exactly.
8161471	8165873	So, and then once we all name our top three, then we're going to do the elimination round, which is always fun.
8165893	8170956	Each of us gets to take one off the list of somebody else's picks, or your own, if you so choose.
8172036	8172937	I just kind of verped a little.
8172977	8173357	That was good.
8173937	8177578	And then the chat room has the ultimate vote.
8177598	8178939	They're going to vote on their top three.
8179379	8183020	And Ice Queen and DDRholic, they're not doing lists, but they'll help us break ties.
8183040	8184961	And Bombay's in the back there too, but he's digging through things.
8186121	8188122	Oh, you look like you were hunched over looking at something.
8189202	8190162	Are you going to hurl?
8190202	8190943	Do you need a barf bag?
8191283	8191683	Are you okay?
8191983	8193223	Do you need a donkey bag?
8194064	8194644	All right, here we go.
8195824	8200226	My first choice for a mocap game is mocap horse racing.
8200842	8202363	MoCap Horse Racing, yay!
8202423	8204764	Where you're suspended on a giant saddle and have to spank.
8205945	8208527	I almost had one like that on my list.
8208567	8211108	Almost like that horse humping game that Namco put out, but not.
8211609	8212529	Oh, Final Furlong?
8213350	8213650	Yeah.
8217572	8218132	That would be fun.
8219733	8220654	MoCap Horse Racing.
8220894	8222695	Would it be complete with initial delight cards?
8223135	8223376	Yeah.
8223516	8224036	Okay, cool.
8224536	8225117	Alright, moving on.
8225377	8225857	Who's next?
8225997	8226217	Next...
8228275	8232200	Um, my first choice is mocap drug dealing.
8232961	8234963	Mocap drug dealing, how would that work?
8235304	8236865	Is that like Police 911 in reverse?
8237206	8237726	Pretty much.
8238127	8242392	Like, you have a certain time period to get your product out on the street as much as possible.
8243453	8245095	What exactly is being mocapped?
8246216	8250340	You run from cops.
8250360	8252841	You actually gotta hand it to people and stuff.
8253462	8255864	Are you on a treadmill when you do the running part?
8256144	8257725	How fast can you whip out a ten?
8259306	8261048	How fast can you take the money and do the drop and run?
8261068	8262089	Catch the dime bags.
8266112	8269975	Well, I'm just gonna kind of expand on one of them that I had.
8270755	8275519	I originally had put down mo-cap dancing, but instead I'm gonna put down mo-cap
8276218	8276758	Rayvar.
8278979	8280980	No, that's just Parapara, I thought.
8281400	8286843	No, see, Parapara is more organized.
8286963	8293266	MoCap Rayvar is more of like, you're kind of just, yeah, more flailing involved.
8293926	8300809	You got special bonus rounds where you get to massage people on E. Yeah, like the first thing, right, when you put in your money, it drops out an E pill.
8301249	8302930	You have to take it and wait five minutes.
8303771	8304311	Exactly.
8305595	8306737	He'll have little glow sticks on strings.
8307618	8309460	He'll have little glow sticks on strings.
8310762	8311483	That's beautiful.
8311744	8312024	All right.
8312064	8313185	I think the lights flicker, too.
8313206	8314127	MoCap Rayvar.
8315148	8316630	Moving on to Dark Tetsuya.
8319094	8320556	MoCap Murder Simulator.
8321116	8322078	MoCap Murder.
8323829	8327271	So would it just be just like stabbing people or shooting them?
8327351	8328512	I guess, yeah.
8330073	8331754	What kind of people would you be murdering?
8332715	8334076	Terrorists.
8334156	8335157	Oh, terrorists.
8335397	8336538	What an American answer.
8336698	8337138	Go down.
8337398	8337698	Alright.
8339179	8339540	Puppy.
8341781	8343242	Mocap binge drinking.
8344663	8346624	Mocap?
8347105	8348325	That's kind of like last night.
8349086	8350407	Mocap binge drinking.
8350487	8351888	I don't think anyone was binging.
8355086	8356067	That was great, yeah.
8356207	8356427	Anyway.
8356687	8357468	Okay, mocap binge.
8357488	8357988	How would that work?
8358008	8360010	Would you have to, like, would it have, like, a floating keg?
8360791	8370399	You'd probably have to, like, run... Okay, kind of along those same lines.
8371159	8374362	My number three choice, I said, is mocap Girls Gone Wild.
8377785	8385128	or what it does is it motion caps the girls lifting their shirts and showing their hooters to the mocap.
8390790	8391751	Yeah, I can see it now.
8391851	8396813	A bunch of little 8-year-old kids lighting up around this machine and seeing this chick just lifting up her shirt.
8399174	8402815	And mocap girls gone wild would have internet ranking, of course.
8405316	8407357	Co-sponsored by AreYouHotOrNot.com
8408061	8409902	Seriously, they've got a site.
8410102	8411883	It's called RateMyBoobs.com.
8414565	8418688	And of course, if Girls Gone Wild does well, we get the sequel, Guys Gone Crazy.
8420909	8431676	You have to have, you have to have, the versions would have to be like the Snoop Dogg, the doggy style one, and then the door room fantasies.
8432176	8432817	No, we want penis.
8434458	8436140	I want to see the cock.
8437181	8437781	Whip it out.
8438702	8439823	How fast can you whip it out?
8440003	8444708	I want initial pee.
8444728	8446269	What's the chatroom say about all this crap?
8446789	8447070	I don't know.
8447090	8448711	I haven't been paying attention.
8448811	8449712	Fucking pump it up.
8451774	8452775	No mocap, Mardi Gras.
8454039	8472732	Okay, um, so now We just, we are just now checking the chatroom by the way, so we didn't steal any answers, so So now for a, I say we go to mine Alright, your number two My number two, MoCap Kama Sutra MoCap Kama Sutra, oh Once again, eight year old children What would be the last level of MoCap Kama Sutra?
8474233	8479797	One where you have to, you know, dislocate your hip and your shoulders to get into the position And then hop around like a drunk monkey
8481717	8483338	As I said before, eight-year-old children.
8484218	8486539	It's just problems right now.
8486839	8487600	Next one, I changed.
8487780	8489140	It'll be MoCap DC Sniper.
8489741	8491481	MoCap DC Sniper.
8492482	8493382	Oh, that's bad.
8493922	8497604	How is this... No, see this whole thing, though?
8497644	8504947	This has, like... No, you'd have, like, the From the Trunk level.
8505700	8508881	And then you'd have, like, the building level, and you'd have to, like, run up the stairs to get the building.
8509402	8510242	Bombay was in the back.
8510282	8514884	He was saying, for those that didn't hear it, the downtown bike puncher mocap game.
8514924	8521187	Because, I don't know if you guys have heard, but here in Sacramento we have this guy who's famous for riding around on a bike in the middle of the night and punching women in the face.
8522467	8527630	Which sounds funny, but it's a horrible crime, I mean, but... Just, it's weird.
8527650	8528970	That's the only way you can describe it.
8529010	8532872	What kind of guy just goes around and punches people in the... Anyway...
8533820	8535380	I don't think it's a guy, I think I'm doing it.
8535801	8537801	Alright.
8538121	8546284	You know, like, DC Sniper, you would, like, actually have to get in different positions, like the prone position and hiding in bushes and stuff.
8546824	8550905	And then you'd have to, like, trek your way across the country to try to get away.
8553206	8554826	Okay, so, moving on, Loki.
8555447	8558587	Alright, I've been changing mine, like, as I'm thinking here, sitting here.
8558948	8561428	I was gonna stop with, uh, mocap surgery, but no.
8561788	8563129	We're not doing mocap surgery.
8563329	8563429	Um...
8564722	8566663	Instead, it's going to be mo-cap vandalism.
8566903	8573225	I mean, this could include, like, freaking mailbox baseball, you know, classic, spray painting.
8573625	8574065	Dude!
8574585	8574765	Wait.
8575285	8577466	Okay, we're going to limit it now.
8577806	8580187	It's going to be mo-cap graffiti.
8581067	8582268	Mo-cap graffiti.
8584888	8586969	Yeah, like you've got to, like, you know, tag shit.
8587389	8590250	It's got skill and, you know, it's cool.
8592802	8593242	Wonderful.
8593322	8593643	Okay.
8594163	8594943	Wait, Joe's next.
8595203	8595544	Oh, yes.
8598005	8602808	I think, for this one, I'm pretty sure that Kat and I, Joe, would probably in it.
8603228	8604749	MoCap line dancing.
8605289	8606850	MoCap line dancing.
8607498	8608439	Oh my lord, okay.
8608459	8609840	I wanna do the electric slide!
8610360	8611301	That would be beautiful.
8612762	8614124	Complete with a ten gallon hat.
8615344	8615905	And boots!
8617266	8618927	Okay.
8618987	8621069	Recycle your para para boots with your line dancing.
8621449	8623711	My number two, mocap donkey punch.
8627694	8629716	Um, what exactly would you be doing in that game?
8634380	8635601	Anita, could you explain this?
8635821	8636982	How does the donkey punch work?
8637856	8642839	Well, how come you think I know so much about it?
8642859	8644319	Because you brought it up last night.
8645480	8649302	Okay, everybody knows what donkey punching is.
8649822	8650322	No, we don't.
8651303	8652343	Could you please explain it?
8652884	8656566	Okay, if you are doing a person in the...
8658522	8660202	Yes, yes, let Loki do it.
8662543	8669244	Okay, freakin' donkey punching is when you're, like, taking a chick from behind, and then you just, you take your fist and you smack it in the back of her head.
8670904	8671604	As hard as you can.
8671644	8672364	As hard as you can.
8672924	8674205	So that she clenches?
8675065	8675345	Yeah.
8677905	8681006	So you're fucking somebody else, and then you start slapping him in the back of the head.
8681766	8682846	It can also be applied to men.
8688266	8688566	Okay.
8689306	8689726	Right.
8689846	8690167	Okay.
8690847	8691927	MoCap Donkey Punch, great.
8692327	8696448	My number two... Um, we have a comment, yay, more about Loki's sex life.
8698749	8699069	Okay.
8699929	8708372	Uh, my number two is, uh, MoCap Snow Art, where, uh, it records your movements of, like, like stage one is writing your name in the snow.
8709386	8712590	and then like, you know, mocap, you know, like just peeing things in the snow.
8713010	8713451	Be beautiful.
8713611	8714592	Only guys can play that.
8714792	8715994	Okay, you know like Mario Party 4?
8716034	8717916	The game for every woman who wishes she had a penis.
8718296	8719317	Well, now you can.
8719498	8720218	Now you can.
8720619	8721219	And you know what?
8721320	8722861	I know women that do the same damn thing.
8722881	8723943	They pee in the snow.
8723963	8724743	They kind of run.
8725284	8726826	They write their name by writing.
8730828	8732229	I've heard stories.
8732269	8735291	They write their name really big by running.
8736572	8738934	For the people who are not here watching, Rob just turned purple.
8739435	8739975	My turn.
8743678	8745499	And actually, mine is not a funny one.
8745579	8748141	Mine is actually a legitimate thing that I wish that they would make.
8748301	8749062	We can't have that.
8749582	8750403	Mocaptron.
8751206	8754969	By the way, Tron 2.0 needs to hurry up and come out.
8789809	8794215	Mocap Zanadu We were back?
8794335	8798981	Hello I hope they got the Mocap Did they get Mocap Tron?
8799161	8802025	I hope so We'll see Alright, keep going
8804526	8809469	Um, one I got is for the most worthless sport in the world, and it would be mocap curling.
8810810	8814392	So I just see someone, like, shuffling a disc, and then you have, you can have, like, a friend play.
8814532	8818234	You're both running in front with these little brooms, trying to scrape out imaginary ice.
8818254	8819575	Mocap curling.
8819655	8820835	Greatest Olympic sport ever.
8821556	8825078	Because you can, like, thank the Canadians for the greatest sport in history.
8829457	8829697	Yes.
8830357	8831078	Imagine it now.
8831398	8834379	The game about the thing that most people despise.
8834779	8837039	The worst form of life on the face of the earth.
8837139	8837720	That's right.
8838340	8839560	MoCap Panamime.
8843481	8844081	Oh, that's great.
8844121	8844762	MoCap Mime.
8844822	8845102	Alright.
8846242	8847743	If you kicked a mime in the nuts, would you scream?
8851437	8854060	Alright, DarkTetsuya says for his number one.
8854480	8855181	Three words.
8855521	8857043	MoCap Mud Wrestling.
8857303	8858625	MoCap Mud Wrestling.
8858905	8859265	Beautiful.
8859305	8859986	Wonder where that came from.
8860006	8862088	Would the sequel be MoCap Cream Corn Wrestling?
8864110	8865031	KY Wrestling.
8866012	8866173	Oh!
8867534	8870537	No, there's a scene for that in that movie Old School.
8870617	8873000	Anyway... It's...
8878814	8881875	I realized that my number one choice sucks.
8881895	8884536	I'm trying to think of a new one, so Rob can go ahead of me.
8885656	8886296	Number one sucks?
8886797	8887057	Yes.
8887617	8888677	Well, just read it anyway.
8888737	8888937	No.
8892039	8893479	But curling's legitimate!
8894600	8895380	Okay.
8895620	8896480	You want to give us some help?
8896580	8899261	Maybe read some things from the chatroom that the chatroom has suggested?
8903323	8903723	Shades?
8904383	8904983	Two words.
8905083	8906004	Mocap shades.
8907421	8916566	And now I shall put on my shades MoCap Rob's voice MoCap Volleyball MoCap Shell Military in Nigeria What?

8966638	8967638	I want mocap shopping.
8967778	8972080	You know what, actually, I'll go with that one that Loki recommends here.
8972420	8973540	Mocap pole dancing.
8974661	8975881	Mocap pole dancing.
8975941	8976361	Beautiful.
8977762	8978262	Be your own.
8978382	8978842	Be the strip.
8979102	8980642	I like that mocap shopping, though.
8980662	8984024	That could be, like, they could have snow art on one side and shopping on the other.
8984064	8985084	Something for the guys and the girls.
8985404	8987265	Mocap supermarket sweep.
8990686	8991526	You want to change your answer?
8993194	8994414	I want to change my answer.
8994434	8996575	Puppy Changes from Pole Dancing to Supermarket Sweep.
8996615	8999897	That show is cool beyond belief.
9002839	9007521	Alright, my number one answer, and I can't believe this hasn't already been named, but I think it's the obvious.
9007921	9008962	MoCap Spanking.
9012084	9018047	I thought there was that one game where you actually had to slap... You actually shove your finger up your ass.
9018367	9019868	Well, not your ass, but the guy's ass.
9021943	9022705	Whatever, I don't know.
9023708	9024752	I say, well, you know what?
9025093	9027299	It isn't a mo-cap game, and they need mo-cap spanking.
9028161	9029582	I think we should start voting shit off the list.
9029662	9031183	Do you want to read what we have so far?
9031403	9053614	So far we have MoCap Horse Racing, MoCap Drug Dealing, MoCap Brave R, spelled R4V4R, MoCap Murder, MoCap Binge Drinking, MoCap Girls Gone Wild, MoCap Kama Sutra, MoCap DC Sniper, MoCap Graffiti, MoCap Line Dancing, MoCap Donkey Punch, MoCap Snow Art, MoCap Tron, MoCap Curling, MoCap Mime, MoCap Mud Wrestling, MoCap Supermarket Suite, and MoCap Spanking.
9055155	9055895	I take out
9059231	9063194	I would have to take off the, um...
9086431	9090994	MoCap Mud Wrestling, because how could you really motion capture that, though?
9092034	9093635	Unless there's two players, you know?
9096677	9097818	Ice Queen's offering to demonstrate.
9097978	9099158	I have had a cry.
9099178	9099899	Thank you.
9099939	9101059	All right, Dark Tetsuya.
9101920	9103080	Oh, no, I'm sorry, Loki's next.
9103100	9103641	I'm sorry, Loki.
9103661	9105162	Whatever, go ahead.
9105182	9106022	Dark Tetsuya's going instead.
9106823	9107643	Binge drinking.
9108684	9109664	MoCap binge, I agree.
9109704	9110945	I was going to take that off.
9110985	9114547	Just because you can't really get liquor from the machine, so it kind of sucks.
9115379	9117280	We should have done mocap praying.
9117300	9118140	Mocap for God.
9118540	9119301	Oh well.
9120061	9126704	No, it's actually going to be... We're taking off... Drug dealing, because...
9142655	9148537	It's... It's just like... It's... No, it's... It's kinda... You need something simpler than that.
9148957	9154579	Like, mocap, uh... Yeah, or something.
9155379	9155720	Alright.
9155840	9156200	Puppy.
9158200	9158600	Puppy.
9158861	9160341	Mocap.
9161682	9168404	Uh... Uh... What?
9170484	9170885	Shut up.
9170945	9171825	I'm trying to decide here.
9172843	9175125	Uh... You gonna fucking cap somebody?
9177387	9178788	Bust a cap in your ass!
9179509	9180590	We're almost done, don't worry.
9180650	9180810	Okay.
9181530	9185293	I will get rid of mocap mine, because it'd be all black and white.
9186034	9186635	And it'd suck.
9187155	9187876	Aw, alright.
9188116	9189337	It should've been mocap charades.
9190498	9192639	This is hard, because I like all of these.
9192940	9198084	Um... I'm gonna have to take off with a little bit of... I have to take off mocap line dancing.
9198104	9198144	Aw.
9198832	9201373	Just because that's kind of what Parapara is.
9201633	9204495	Parapara is kind of line dancing, so they already have it, as far as I can see.
9204575	9206316	Otherwise, they're... Anyway, they're...
9223223	9226206	We're having a little bit of dead air right now.
9228488	9229930	So what are we going to do?
9229950	9230790	Are we going to read the list?
9232732	9233433	We'll read the list.
9233833	9247767	The first one is MoCap Horse Racing, MoCap Ravar, MoCap Murder, Girls Gone Wild, Kama Sutra, DC Sniper, Graffiti, Snow Art, Tron, Curling, Supermarket Sweep, and Spanking.

9252120	9253601	Ooh, Spanking.
9255462	9256442	Well, sorry.
9256963	9257723	Nobody else took it off.
9258624	9260605	MoCap UPS delivery driver.
9260805	9264148	Just like frickin' Ace Ventura, the opening scene there.
9265288	9266409	Sounds a little broken.
9268751	9269771	You know what else?
9269811	9274454	It's just, you know MoCap UPS driver, you just walk up to the door and then like hot women jump on you and try to fuck you.
9275275	9279478	Because like everybody, like a bunch of women I know get really horny over the UPS driver for whatever reason.
9285590	9287392	It's the fact that he comes and he goes.
9287732	9291755	He comes to the place, he brings a package, and he leaves.
9292696	9293656	That's what it is.
9296358	9297139	It's the track.
9297439	9298720	People love the track.
9300822	9302683	Anyway, we're accepting your votes right now.
9302703	9304365	We're going to go to break while you send in your votes.
9305125	9307687	And we'll have a response when we come back.
9308228	9308488	Okay.
9331545	9332186	and many more.
9403758	9404544	Thanks for watching!

9720738	9722579	Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
9722739	9725240	Because Bongo demands it.
9727201	9727641	We're back.
9728401	9729642	And we have a winner.
9730182	9730682	A few of them.
9731613	9738456	Number three for Best MoCap Game is MoCap Snow Art.
9739676	9745879	Hooray for P. Number two winner is MoCap Rayvar.
9746779	9747660	Whee!
9748780	9753362	And the number one is MoCap Kama Sutra.
9754522	9756063	Because, dammit, we like the nookie.
9756883	9757344	Yay!
9759528	9762789	Alright, another fabulous list list comes to a close.
9763489	9763769	Okay.
9765650	9765990	What happened?
9766010	9767270	I meant to save it and I closed it.
9767550	9767830	Oh well.
9768651	9769111	Life goes on.
9769391	9771872	Somebody in the chat room posted on Yusuf Osaka Forest.
9771892	9772172	Thank you.
9772192	9772472	The end.
9772672	9772912	Alright.
9773432	9776173	So, now we're going to do, we're going to Ask Orange Lounge.
9776193	9778714	We're going to close out this with a couple quick questions for Ask Orange Lounge.
9778734	9780394	Yeah, let's do Ask Orange Lounge.
9780494	9780954	Okay, so.
9780974	9781635	We've got ten minutes.
9781675	9782875	Send your question over PM.
9783115	9785616	Send your question over private message to DarkSakura.
9785636	9787716	Remember, we have a ton of guests in studio tonight.
9787736	9789737	By the way, by the way, bad grammar.
9789837	9791217	It's not should of, it's should have.
9792757	9793958	And you're guilty of that, too.
9794358	9794738	So what?
9797639	9799059	You still knew what I was saying.
9799099	9801059	I went off on that on one of my fuckies of the week.
9801940	9804880	Well, let's see if we have our first question.
9804900	9807601	Here's a big ball of Kleenex just for you, dear.
9808877	9811818	First question comes from ManekiNekoJass.
9812118	9812538	Oh, yay!
9812938	9813618	Are you gay?
9816838	9818759	If you scream, you call, you gay.
9819459	9821779	So wait, are we going to go around and find out who's gay?
9821859	9823160	Is he directing that one person?
9823660	9825260	This is a Margaret Cho quote.
9825700	9827300	Oh, it's just a Margaret Cho quote?
9827400	9828080	Are you gay?
9828361	9830521	Oh, well then, if it's not a real question, forget it.
9830601	9831761	I have a response to that.
9832021	9833181	I actually have a response to that.
9835602	9836142	Oh, wait, I'm sorry.
9837691	9841132	Mommy think everybody little bit gay.
9841153	9846595	I'm a lesbian trapped in a man's body.
9848315	9849496	I don't know, I like boobs sometimes.
9849516	9850957	I'm a lesbian trapped in a man's body.
9852157	9853077	I like boobs sometimes.
9853097	9854438	How many times have we heard that one before?
9855298	9856799	Were you going to play a response to that?
9857079	9857899	Yeah, I am.
9858120	9858920	Alright, then let's hear it.
9862902	9865643	I inherited my father's eyes and my mother's...
9869468	9869868	Here we go.
9872869	9873869	I'll eat pussy.
9878271	9880231	It's just not my first choice.
9885513	9890235	I'll eat pussy if they run out of what I really want.
9892775	9893276	Interesting.
9893436	9893716	Okay.
9895036	9895616	Moving on.
9896137	9897257	Next question comes from JB.
9898101	9899742	When will my SciFam CD get here?
9899762	9902124	It will get here on next Thursday.
9918443	9919424	Oh, let's see if Rob's right.
9920245	9922006	Okay, our next one comes from Japan Man.
9922907	9924148	Anyone looking for a good time?
9924808	9925048	Yes.
9925309	9925789	Not from you.
9927050	9928131	That's why we're here.
9928912	9930753	Do you have a phone number we can call?
9931153	9931734	Hey, baby.
9932900	9939323	By the way, just between you and me, that's what I'm aiming for for Season 3, is the debut of the phones.
9940003	9940203	Yes.
9941404	9949267	When Loki and I move, because then we'll be able to dedicate a home line, because, you know, who cares if Orange Lounge people are calling during the middle of the day?
9949807	9953148	The next question comes from 23rd Magnus, actually for DarkTessia.
9954769	9959831	I never asked you, if you had to collide Japanese girls in a bucket of chocolate, what would you do?
9962503	9964165	Our next question comes from Chubbs.
9964185	9968170	Will you be hosting Orange Dome's radio during March Madness and can I be a guest?
9977603	9978203	Yes and yes.
9979024	9979985	When's your next drunk show?
9980765	9982106	When we have a three-day weekend.
9982566	9983947	Probably the Saturday night.
9984007	9984247	I got it.
9984367	9984828	I got it.
9985028	9986729	Sunday night after March Madness.
9986829	9988310	Oh, that's right, because you and me have Monday off.
9988330	9989231	We should do a fuck-up drunk.
9989831	9990151	You and me.
9990251	9991772	Well, the thing is, okay, this is the interesting thing.
9992132	9995855	In two weeks, Orange Lounge will be preempted by the live running.
9996515	9997336	Thanks for watching!
10014551	10018174	If you want to get in on this, listen to our live tournament coverage.
10018194	10024458	It's going to go all day long, and it's just for you guys who are far away, because we figure most people from California are going to be here at the tournament.
10024478	10025278	You'll get to hear everybody.
10025839	10029641	And our next drunk show is probably going to be right after that, because we're going to be like, fuck this, and get drunk.
10029901	10034905	We will probably do a live fuck-off show immediately following the March Madness coverage.
10035005	10037206	Well, our next question comes from SkylineDC505.
10037626	10040849	It says, will I pass my drive test this Thursday?
10041729	10042350	Sure.
10042690	10044311	You will pass it with an 80 like I did.
10045391	10049832	AOSFE, what type of questions can I ask people to make them think I'm interested?
10050472	10051172	I'm sorry, what was it?
10051813	10054453	What type of questions can I ask people to make them think I'm interested?
10055993	10057534	What color panties are you wearing?
10059334	10060574	I like peanut butter, what the fuck?
10061595	10063135	There you go, that's a great question.
10063475	10064215	More than Jake.
10065015	10067776	I like peanut butter, do you want to fuck?
10068736	10071517	More than Jake asks, why won't anybody pick up the phone?
10071557	10072257	Because we're not there.
10075535	10076215	Send an email.
10076255	10077175	Welcome to the new millennium.
10077215	10077376	Hi.
10077636	10078116	23rd Magus.
10078956	10080316	Have any of you actually called 867-5309?
10080917	10083397	No, I never have.
10083477	10084177	Everybody in their lives.
10084197	10084958	But I have called.
10085198	10088939	Hey, for those of you local in Sacramento in the 916 area code, I have called 332-2222.
10088979	10092440	That's all I'm going to say.
10093620	10099502	Well, I'll have you know that actually because of that song right there, that's why in every single movie all the phone numbers are 555.
10101727	10101988	Yes.
10103069	10117527	Because 555, no one can have a number with that on it because those are dedicated straight for like the movies and stuff because people like that call that number and then some guy just got, I mean, totally pissed off at that, you know?
10117587	10119349	Yeah, I mean, really, don't you guys watch Pop-Up Video?
10119509	10120631	They said it like 80 times now.
10121645	10129116	Actually, I believe if any of you saw the movie Punch Drunk Love, there's a scene where Adam Sandler's calling a porn sex line or something and they use a real number.
10129397	10134624	Well, what they did is that Hollywood bought that 800 number and then put an advertisement for the movie on it.
10135565	10136106	That's kind of funny.
10137108	10139791	Um, JBS, can I talk on the air during March Madness?
10139831	10141993	I will hypnotize you all with sci-fi and talk mohahaha.
10142073	10145237	Yes, any- Okay, this is the interesting thing.
10145257	10153287	If March Madness gets set up like we hope it does, we're not gonna be, like, tucked away in the corner, like, way in the back where you won't be able to see us.
10153943	10161665	We are hoping that we're going to have, if the tourney is outdoors, like we're thinking it's going to be, provided it's not raining, we're hoping that the gazebo is going to be Orange Lounge.
10161925	10164646	And if any of you have been to Scandia and see the gazebo out back, it's huge.
10164666	10165506	You won't miss us.
10165686	10166506	So come on by.
10166566	10168547	It's going to be open door all day.
10168627	10170507	So nobody else needs to ask that.
10170567	10171608	Yes, you can be on the show.
10171708	10172668	Just come on by and say hi.
10172848	10175409	Will you guys be here in the summer for CBN too?
10175489	10176669	So can I be a guest that's from Rice?
10178773	10186640	Uh, give me some dates, as long as it's, I can afford it, I don't see why not, yeah, I've, I've not heard anything about CBM2.
10188522	10195809	Cause there, we already know there's gonna be B3, uh, May 17th and 18th, and definitely gonna be there, so, you should be there too!
10197125	10198386	May is a little before summer though.
10198406	10204294	I imagine CyberBeat, they wouldn't want to do that more than twice a year, if even that.
10204394	10208760	So I would think that January, probably July would be the earliest they'd want to do that.
10208840	10210622	So, I don't know.
10211163	10212265	Give us dates, we'll see.
10213346	10220032	And another one from Jas, what are each of our favorite extreme songs first?
10220933	10226878	I don't really play extreme that much, because I would normally name anything that Tack does.
10228139	10230221	I'm actually going to go with Guacamole Del Taco.
10233684	10240150	Contrary to what a lot of people see me play, I actually seem to like B-11 a lot more than I put on.
10243740	10248884	I always play A on doubles only because the steps are fun.
10249144	10251666	And people like watching you run around the pad really fast.
10252226	10255188	They're like, ooh, arrows going up the screen.
10256129	10256609	Yeah, so.
10263013	10264695	Okay, so who wants to make a comment?
10264715	10264995	Come on.
10265015	10265695	I will.
10266976	10268397	V, definitely.
10268417	10269418	V or Butterfly.
10269918	10270599	Hey, that's on Extreme.
10270639	10270939	Right on.
10274209	10275650	Le Copa De La Vida.
10276411	10276791	Amen.
10278332	10279333	Okay, don't laugh.
10279473	10280353	Okay, don't laugh.
10280433	10280734	All right.
10281334	10284256	Jeanne, Jeanne, Doubles Heavy.
10284817	10285677	I love it.
10285737	10286538	Yeah, it's cool.
10287078	10287979	It's fly.
10290681	10291041	Let's see.
10291821	10296124	I'm stuck between Mobile Logan, Golden Decouple.
10296965	10297305	Ice Queen?
10298306	10298987	Favorite extreme song?
10300501	10301802	Rhythm of Police on Devil's Heavy.
10303744	10304684	You big stud.
10306326	10309648	I'm going to call me fag, but I do, I do, I do.
10309768	10310269	I love that song.
10310749	10311029	Fag.
10313031	10314492	He said so.
10315253	10319236	Okay, and Rob, can he sit at your house with your mic?
10320597	10321458	I think so, yeah.
10321538	10325561	I still haven't run that by Brian for sure, but I have told him there is a tournament and people will probably be here.
10325881	10327502	I just, yeah, I'm pretty sure.
10327522	10328303	Let's just say yes.
10328343	10329504	If there's a change to that, I'll let you know.
10330622	10331863	He's pretty cool with stuff like that.
10331883	10333685	JB wants to know if I can legally become his cousin.
10335386	10335906	We could try.
10335926	10339209	I'm adopting you anyway, so... Interesting.
10339289	10340049	How would that work?
10342311	10343572	Your aunt would have to adopt me.
10344873	10346554	What about, could your aunt adopt him?
10346715	10347215	Do you have an aunt?
10348956	10352359	I have a bunch of aunts, but... You don't want them to adopt JB?
10352399	10354961	You'd rather be adopted by JB's... I'm scared of my family, so...
10357927	10359127	Okay, so you'll try.
10360088	10362268	Maybe you can go on the people's court and make that happen.
10362788	10365169	Let's go on people's court and have them legally make us cousins.
10367990	10368750	This is the plaintiff.
10370150	10373671	And then, can I kill ATT, Comcast?
10373992	10377112	Well, ATT can go, but Comcast is actually doing good service for me.
10378673	10379953	You can come over here and use my cable.
10382014	10385015	Can I put a big sign on the gazebo that says Orange Lounge Temple of Butt?
10385635	10385835	No.
10386593	10389214	No, because it's Scandia Family Fun Center.
10389994	10392756	If we shake hands at March Madness, does that make one of us outface?
10393596	10394436	And that's the DT.
10397097	10397517	Um, no.
10398858	10399558	Yeah, sure.
10400959	10401699	Ask us more questions.
10401739	10402479	We have one more minute.
10403720	10405581	Wasting time, wasting time, wasting time.
10405601	10408882	Does anybody in the room have a question for anyone else that they want to ask live on air?
10412503	10416624	I didn't mean to say that, but yeah, I was answering a question.
10416804	10418325	Yeah, that's why I said the evil.
10418885	10420266	Hey, we have a question from Japan Man.
10420326	10420606	Yay.
10420886	10421126	Hey.
10422486	10423326	That's what it says, hey.
10424307	10425187	What's up?
10425567	10425847	Yo.
10426067	10428028	More than Jake, how many questions can you ask in a minute?
10429285	10430286	Start asking, let's see.
10430306	10430586	At least 60.
10430626	10430686	Why?
10430706	10430806	Why?
10430826	10430966	Why?
10430986	10431106	Why?

10456761	10457221	Bad.
10457741	10458202	Awful.
10458222	10458982	Piece of shit.
10459002	10460563	It was created in the temple of butt.
10460623	10461664	Worse than T-word.
10463025	10463645	Hi, guys!
10464125	10464525	Hi!
10464645	10465086	Hi, guys!
10465626	10467427	And JB, what's your favorite SyFam song?
10468448	10470709	That track 16 one.
10472310	10473150	Ah, You Leave Me Alone.
10473170	10476973	The Jennifer song, it's too late to say goodbye or something.
10477953	10478774	You Leave Me Alone, Venus.
10479054	10479394	Easy.
10479494	10480935	Anybody else want to say favorite SyFam song?
10483106	10484368	Rob, you should probably know this one.
10485289	10485809	Love the Angel.
10488632	10490695	Boom, boom, boom.
10490715	10494119	That Irresistible Man or whatever, that one that's on the Darkstream.
10495020	10500426	I'm actually going to play the one that I really like after the credits, so stay tuned for a bit.
10501275	10502775	Um, you know what, that does it.
10503396	10504836	Let's get into the last question, we'll cut it off.
10504876	10506616	Oh, if it's Jennifer Rice and Scythe, then never mind.
10507956	10510437	Then I don't know, Irresistible Monk.
10511337	10512037	Are you in joy?
10512998	10513358	Yes.
10513458	10514058	Are we in joy?
10514578	10515398	Yes!
10515798	10516598	Final thoughts, time.
10517198	10518639	Um, final thoughts.
10519259	10520399	I'm still going to play that song anyway.
10522720	10524180	Um, don't fall down and hurt yourself.
10526912	10527653	I don't have any.
10528434	10529535	I'm sorry, I don't have any.
10529915	10530335	How about you?
10531757	10535420	I have to go home and work on my website and my anime ezine that I have to do for my work.
10537122	10540385	Full of peanut butter cups are harder to throw than just wrappers.
10542767	10544849	I have to go to work tomorrow and I really don't want to.
10547512	10548533	I don't know nothing.
10554992	10558536	If you ever go to Chico, beware the sheep, they're all sluts.
10561338	10563200	Will someone fuck me if I just lie there?
10567785	10568305	No comment.
10570687	10572349	Do you really want somebody to answer that, Rob?
10573490	10573830	Maybe.
