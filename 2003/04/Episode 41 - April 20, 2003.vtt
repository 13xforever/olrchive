00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Message for you, son!

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Do you want to hear the most annoying fan in the world?

00:10.000 --> 00:19.000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Togg and Ben sub.

00:19.000 --> 00:26.000
Orange Lounge may contain adult content. Orange Lounge may contain many four letter words.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.500
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.500
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

00:35.500 --> 00:36.500
In this episode...

00:41.500 --> 00:43.000
Hey, are there any balls down there?

00:43.000 --> 00:45.500
That's the biggest berry you've ever seen, Dingleberry.

00:45.500 --> 00:48.500
What's your favorite scary movie?

00:48.500 --> 00:51.500
Showgirls. Absolutely frightening.

00:51.500 --> 00:52.500
What's yours?

00:52.500 --> 00:55.000
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Now's the time on Sprockets and me dogs!

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too!

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
I know kung fu.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Why did they have to take the word gay?

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
No! What I expect from a funny situation is Hindu.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Hey!

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Dark sapphire.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
Shut up! Where's my gun? This is my boom stick.

01:24.000 --> 01:31.000
Skye. Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb. Loki. I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
What kind of what human being would find that funny? Orange Lounge Radio.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
We are live and this is episode number 41 for April the 20th of 2003.

01:43.000 --> 01:51.000
You're tuned into the Bimani scene's most egg-citing radio station of all things, Biiiiimani!

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
That was bad.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
I came up with that joke all by myself.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Hand.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Ow.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
Did everyone hear that? Here, I'll do it louder.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
Ow! Mommy.

02:06.000 --> 02:13.000
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner of the happy and most dominating bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
I have Battle Royale manga. Everybody must die.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
You know her better as Dark Sakura, the battle roy, Alhorn.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki!

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Hey everyone.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Guess what, kids? It's just us tonight.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
Yay!

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Feelers of love, going back to our roots.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Yay!

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Actually, that's not totally true.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Intern Zero is going to be by a little later, hopefully.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
And some other pals, too. I don't know who's all coming.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
But for the start of the show, it's just us.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Yay!

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
So, we'll be talking to everybody when they get here more a little bit later. We've got a little bit of the money.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
Dude, we talked about that last week.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
We have some things.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
That guy rocks, man. He rocks even more in frickin' manga.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
We're gonna start off with some 2DX music. We'll be back. Enjoy.

03:28.000 --> 03:49.000
Sometimes I am singing meaningful lines Sometimes I have to go to work, I have to leave

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
Oh, I feel the pressure on my mind

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
So I knew it might be right

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
But I can't wait for my memories

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
For this life

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
I go, I need it

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
I want to be around

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
I keep it, I touch it

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
I give you all my life

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
My life, my glory

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
I give you all my life

04:28.000 --> 04:35.000
All I want is to be free till the end

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
You're my baby, you're my making love with you

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
I will stay

05:36.000 --> 05:42.000
with you, with you

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
I love you and love

05:47.000 --> 05:53.000
with me too, with me too

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
One day, one day, two days, one day

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
With the sun a cold moon in the dark

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
I'll fly, fly, yeah, I'll stay

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
Every day, I'll fly, yeah, I'll stay

06:05.000 --> 06:23.000
Fade to black

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
Love you

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
Yeah, me too

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
Yeah, me too

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
Oh, you and me

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
Well, I do

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
.

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
.

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.000
.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
.

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
.

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
.

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Oh

11:02.000 --> 11:05.800
Bing pong balls!

11:05.800 --> 11:09.320
I think that's my favorite sound effect that Jamie ever did.

11:09.320 --> 11:13.120
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio episode number forty one, April the

11:13.120 --> 11:14.580
twentieth of two thousand three.

11:14.580 --> 11:18.680
Happy Easter to all you kids out there listening and if you aren't down with

11:18.680 --> 11:20.200
Easter, then happy Sunday to you.

11:20.200 --> 11:24.640
I totally forgot that was Easter, that's why the arcade was empty. You didn't do anything today?

11:24.640 --> 11:26.560
No. I didn't really...

11:26.560 --> 11:30.180
I went over to my parents' house and had a little ham, and that was it.

11:30.180 --> 11:32.180
We had a ham a week ago.

11:32.180 --> 11:34.620
So I just ate food.

11:34.620 --> 11:37.500
Just ate food.

11:37.500 --> 11:40.260
A late happy birthday wish to Jamie.

11:40.260 --> 11:42.820
She was one year older as of yesterday.

11:42.820 --> 11:44.940
Happy birthday wishes to you, because your

11:44.940 --> 11:47.660
birthday was yesterday.

11:47.660 --> 11:49.620
And how did you celebrate?

11:49.620 --> 11:50.860
I killed people.

11:54.460 --> 11:57.620
Went to the auction, and I got legendary acts for the

11:57.620 --> 11:58.860
TurboGrafx.

11:58.860 --> 12:01.860
Cool. I didn't know they made that for TurboGrafx.

12:01.860 --> 12:02.860
Yep.

12:02.860 --> 12:03.860
Neat.

12:03.860 --> 12:07.860
And I got, um, uh, what was it?

12:07.860 --> 12:12.860
Some game for the Atari adapter for the Colecovision.

12:12.860 --> 12:14.860
I don't remember what it was.

12:14.860 --> 12:15.860
Centipede.

12:15.860 --> 12:16.860
Oh, cool.

12:16.860 --> 12:19.860
Turns out I already had it.

12:19.860 --> 12:23.860
This lovely bit of, um, literature that you gave me.

12:23.860 --> 12:25.860
Ah, yes, my present, which are always the best.

12:25.860 --> 12:28.860
Which I'm busy trying to remember.

12:28.860 --> 12:33.860
It sucks because I'm so out of practice on my hiragana that I'm having problems reading some of these names.

12:33.860 --> 12:37.860
I haven't gotten you anything yet because I had to buy my mom something her birthday is tomorrow.

12:37.860 --> 12:38.860
That's fine.

12:38.860 --> 12:40.860
No priorities and all.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.860
And you gave me a gift certificate round.

12:42.860 --> 12:43.860
Mm-hmm.

12:43.860 --> 12:45.860
So I can go buy my Battle Royale novel in stock.

12:45.860 --> 12:49.860
So you can indulge more in that Battle Royale-ness.

12:49.860 --> 12:52.860
That big inside joke that just won't die.

12:52.860 --> 12:54.860
It's beyond an inside joke at this point.

12:54.860 --> 13:00.040
It's a lifestyle for some really cool card from Brad and Irene that has it's like one of my favorite

13:01.980 --> 13:07.100
One of my favorite far-side ones is the many expressions of the Irish Center which are all the same

13:09.420 --> 13:11.420
I've got money from grandma

13:11.540 --> 13:15.300
which I put in the bank to pay bills because I'm currently not working and

13:16.300 --> 13:18.300
I got lunch

13:18.300 --> 13:25.140
Jessica and she bought me a clip-on desk lamp so that I can like not go blind when I draw very cool

13:27.300 --> 13:29.860
You can maybe double and use it with your gameboy too if you wanted

13:34.220 --> 13:39.360
Burner I got lots of ice cream. Oh ice creams always good. Did you have cake and ice cream?

13:39.360 --> 13:41.360
No, no, cake. I'd brownie in my ice cream.

13:41.360 --> 13:43.360
Well, that's close enough to cake. Cake pie!

13:44.360 --> 13:45.360
Cake pie!

13:46.360 --> 13:47.360
I want, I want ice cream.

13:48.360 --> 13:49.360
Julie got me a boba.

13:50.360 --> 13:52.360
We can go get, let's get ice cream after tonight's show.

13:52.360 --> 13:52.360
Okay.

13:52.360 --> 13:53.360
I want ice cream too.

13:53.360 --> 13:54.360
Are you gonna get me ice cream?

13:54.360 --> 13:55.360
I guess I can.

13:55.360 --> 13:56.360
Woohoo! Cause I'm broke.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.360
Spoiler enough. That's alright.

13:58.360 --> 13:59.360
I gotta get more ice cream.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.360
I'm only looking for cake pie ice cream though.

14:02.360 --> 14:07.360
We should take, we should get some cake batter ice cream and some like pumpkin pie ice cream and mix them together.

14:07.360 --> 14:09.360
and mix them together. Voila! Cake pie ice cream!

14:09.360 --> 14:11.360
They don't have pumpkin pie ice cream.

14:11.360 --> 14:13.360
They don't have pumpkin pie ice cream?

14:13.360 --> 14:15.360
You know what my favorite is now? Is getting the cake batter ice cream.

14:15.360 --> 14:21.360
They have pumpkin ice cream, it's good enough, it's just like, you know the frickin jelly bellies,

14:21.360 --> 14:23.360
you know, you mix them together and you create some.

14:23.360 --> 14:30.360
You get some peanut butter flavored ice cream with some like strawberry flavored ice cream. Bam!

14:30.360 --> 14:32.360
Rob, you need to try the one I made for you.

14:32.360 --> 14:34.360
I made Dan. Dan said surprise him.

14:34.360 --> 14:36.360
Um, that's dangerous with me and Coldstone.

14:36.360 --> 14:36.860
Yes.

14:36.860 --> 14:40.860
I took cake batter ice cream, peanut butter cups, and caramel-

14:40.860 --> 14:42.860
Oh, I'm so fuckin' hungry!

14:45.360 --> 14:49.360
My favorite now is the cake batter ice cream with brownie and coconut.

14:49.360 --> 14:50.860
Mmm.

14:50.860 --> 14:54.360
I used to get cheesecake with graham cracker and cherries.

14:54.360 --> 14:57.860
This is like Iron Chef where the secret ingredient is Coldstone.

14:59.360 --> 15:00.860
Um, by the way-

15:00.860 --> 15:01.860
Yes?

15:01.860 --> 15:03.860
Um, do you wanna see a really painful way to die?

15:03.860 --> 15:05.860
Okay, cuz this'll be great radio.

15:05.860 --> 15:07.860
Isn't this a great picture of...

15:07.860 --> 15:12.860
That's... Oh my god, he looks like Nine in that pic- or are you talking about the other one?

15:12.860 --> 15:13.860
Oh, hello.

15:13.860 --> 15:14.860
Okay, I'm gonna scan this.

15:14.860 --> 15:15.860
He's sexy.

15:15.860 --> 15:19.860
And send pictures of this to everybody here, because this is like the best manga ever.

15:19.860 --> 15:26.860
It shows this guy here, I forgot which one he is, has this picture of him, of Mimura hugging the younger one to comfort him.

15:26.860 --> 15:28.860
And then these bullets going through his face.

15:28.860 --> 15:29.860
Aww.

15:29.860 --> 15:33.860
And, like, it has the bullet time trail, like, in, um, what was that game?

15:33.860 --> 15:34.860
On PC.

15:34.860 --> 15:36.860
Uh, Dead to Rights?

15:36.860 --> 15:37.860
No, no, no.

15:37.860 --> 15:40.860
Where he'd go into bullet time and they'd dodge all the bullets, and...

15:40.860 --> 15:41.860
Dead to Rights?

15:41.860 --> 15:42.860
Max Payne.

15:42.860 --> 15:43.860
Max Payne?

15:43.860 --> 15:44.860
Max Payne.

15:44.860 --> 15:45.860
Uh...

15:45.860 --> 15:46.860
You know what I have to say about that?

15:46.860 --> 15:47.860
He looks like Big Boy.

15:47.860 --> 15:48.860
That's the Frodo!

15:48.860 --> 15:49.860
That's who it looks like.

15:49.860 --> 15:50.860
Frodo!

15:50.860 --> 15:51.860
Oh my gosh!

15:51.860 --> 15:52.860
That's the Frodo.

15:52.860 --> 15:53.860
He does look like Frodo.

15:53.860 --> 15:59.860
And look, when he falls on the ground, his head busts open and there's brains all over the place.

15:59.860 --> 16:01.860
Ew!

16:01.860 --> 16:07.860
And he got shot across his belly and his intestines start coming out, so he freakin' duct tapes them back in.

16:07.860 --> 16:11.860
Aww, nasty. Are they ever going to make a battle royale video game? Why don't they?

16:11.860 --> 16:12.860
They should.

16:12.860 --> 16:13.860
Why don't they?

16:13.860 --> 16:15.860
Because we suck.

16:15.860 --> 16:18.860
They won't make a video game because we suck.

16:18.860 --> 16:22.860
Damn right, because the stupid Americans get offended by everything.

16:22.860 --> 16:27.360
Oh my god, it's red! Which is sinuous blood! Which is bad!

16:27.360 --> 16:30.860
As he's bleeding to death, he wires a bomb.

16:31.360 --> 16:32.860
This is so cool.

16:33.860 --> 16:37.860
I don't know if I'm gonna regret buying that for Jamie. She might come up with too many ideas.

16:37.860 --> 16:41.860
And then he tries to pull up Kiriyama. And Kiriyama, by the way, looks like the Uber-Bishonen.

16:42.360 --> 16:45.360
Instead of either looking like the Japanese guy who's not.

16:45.360 --> 16:50.920
If you hear of any large explosions in the Sacramento area, I've never met Jamie.

16:50.920 --> 16:57.840
Never knew her.

16:57.840 --> 17:00.520
So orders of business tonight.

17:00.520 --> 17:04.880
As you may or may not know, tonight, ladies and gentlemen, is the last episode of Orange

17:04.880 --> 17:07.740
Lounge Radio.

17:07.740 --> 17:11.080
In this studio.

17:11.080 --> 17:14.720
Just had to get him going for a minute, yes.

17:14.720 --> 17:19.080
It's the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio in this studio, in this lovely little house

17:19.080 --> 17:23.800
that I'm in right now, in Orange Lounge World Headquarters in Citrus Heights, to be specific.

17:23.800 --> 17:28.960
It's the last one here because we're going to have Battle Royale here tomorrow.

17:28.960 --> 17:32.800
We'll invite a bunch of people that I don't like and then I'll kill them.

17:32.800 --> 17:33.800
They'll all die.

17:33.800 --> 17:38.480
So, we had the chat room going for a minute, they're all, no!

17:38.480 --> 17:39.480
I love lag.

17:39.480 --> 17:40.480
Anyway, actually...

17:40.480 --> 17:41.480
I fooled you!

17:41.480 --> 17:51.720
Actually, what's happening next Saturday is the big move, and what's happening is I'm

17:51.720 --> 17:56.080
moving out of the house I'm in right now, and I've got to give a big thank you on the

17:56.080 --> 18:01.040
show, even though he's not listening right now to Brian, my current roommate, but he's

18:01.040 --> 18:08.400
put up with a lot of crap on this show through the past 40 some odd episodes that we've done

18:08.400 --> 18:14.000
here, and he basically lets me take over the house on Sunday nights, and so we appreciate

18:14.000 --> 18:15.000
that.

18:15.000 --> 18:18.600
Next week's show, however, since there's going to be so much going on between the move and

18:18.600 --> 18:21.600
Jamie and I have another commitment we've got to take care of on Sunday night, next

18:21.600 --> 18:22.600
week's show's going to be pre-taped.

18:22.600 --> 18:23.600
Maybe.

18:23.600 --> 18:24.600
Maybe?

18:24.600 --> 18:25.600
Maybe.

18:25.600 --> 18:26.600
What's your idea?

18:26.600 --> 18:32.360
I'll have my computer set up, that's like priority number one, I can't live without

18:32.360 --> 18:33.360
my computer.

18:33.360 --> 18:34.360
So we might not have the internet in time, that's the only problem.

18:34.360 --> 18:35.360
You don't have the computer set up, but there might not be an internet.

18:35.360 --> 18:36.360
Why?

18:36.360 --> 18:38.360
We had to call this week and get it set up.

18:38.360 --> 18:39.360
I know, I know.

18:39.360 --> 18:42.360
They might not come out till Monday or Tuesday, or if they're not open on the weekend.

18:42.360 --> 18:43.360
I have dial-up.

18:43.360 --> 18:44.360
I still have my internet.

18:44.360 --> 18:45.360
We'll figure something out.

18:45.360 --> 18:47.360
We'll figure something out.

18:47.360 --> 18:50.360
But bare minimum, there'll be a tape show next week.

18:50.360 --> 18:53.360
There'll be some kind of show, news show this Sunday.

18:53.360 --> 18:54.360
And then after that...

18:54.360 --> 18:55.360
Did you say a nude show?

18:55.360 --> 18:57.360
A nude show, that would be interesting.

18:57.360 --> 19:00.360
We'll get you a stripper.

19:00.360 --> 19:01.360
My birthday's coming up.

19:01.360 --> 19:03.360
We'll get you a stripper.

19:03.360 --> 19:06.360
This is a big'un, because I'm 25 this year.

19:06.360 --> 19:09.360
I can't believe I just gave my age over here, god.

19:09.360 --> 19:14.360
Now I'm like, I've just placed myself in that over-20 DDR player.

19:14.360 --> 19:17.360
I was very happy because the guy at Coldstone...

19:17.360 --> 19:21.360
First of all, Julie made them sing to me.

19:21.360 --> 19:23.360
I wanted to die.

19:23.360 --> 19:26.360
Secondly, the guy behind the counter...

19:26.360 --> 19:32.360
In all seriousness, because I look, to be sure, asked me if I was turning 18.

19:32.360 --> 19:36.360
Did you get carded to an R-rated movie?

19:36.360 --> 19:38.360
Hey, that's not funny.

19:38.360 --> 19:40.360
That's not funny at all!

19:40.360 --> 19:44.360
Stupid freaking dead man at Campus Chico Theater, you suck!

19:44.360 --> 19:46.360
At least he didn't ask for a...

19:46.360 --> 19:48.360
Hi, can I speak to your mommy?

19:48.360 --> 19:50.360
No, you can't fucking talk to my mommy, motherfucker!

19:50.360 --> 19:52.360
Why would the Cold Stone guy want to talk to your mommy?

19:52.360 --> 19:54.360
No!

19:54.360 --> 19:58.360
See, I don't mind when I'm looking face to face with someone and then...

19:58.360 --> 20:00.360
Hey little girl, I bet your mommy's pretty hot!

20:00.360 --> 20:03.360
What the hell? Why would he want to see your mommy?

20:03.360 --> 20:05.360
No, I'm talking to everyone in telemarketing.

20:05.360 --> 20:07.360
I know, I know.

20:07.360 --> 20:09.360
Wait, wait.

20:09.360 --> 20:12.360
I bet I told him to die, go to hell, and opt me off his mailing list.

20:12.360 --> 20:14.360
That'd be like, you know, some guy going,

20:14.360 --> 20:16.360
Hey, I bet your mom's pretty hot.

20:16.360 --> 20:18.360
Well, she's dead. Oh, good, then she can't say no.

20:18.360 --> 20:21.360
Oh, that's fucked up.

20:21.360 --> 20:22.360
Low-key sound politically correct.

20:22.360 --> 20:24.360
Statement of the night, thank you.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.360
I screw political correctness.

20:26.360 --> 20:28.360
It's an excuse. It's a crutch.

20:28.360 --> 20:34.360
Back to the story of the moving in Orange Launch Radio. So in two weeks, we'll be coming to you from our brand new studio.

20:34.360 --> 20:36.360
We'll be free-loading.

20:36.360 --> 20:39.360
Our brand new studio. If there's a problem, though, maybe we can...

20:39.360 --> 20:40.360
You can pay for my gas.

20:40.360 --> 20:47.360
If there happens to be a problem, maybe we can convince Jamie to do a studio Jamie for a night, which would be fine.

20:47.360 --> 20:49.360
Why? I'm going to be there, too.

20:49.360 --> 20:56.360
I know, but if something happens and our Internet's not up by then, we might have to do that show right...at your house.

20:56.360 --> 20:57.360
Oh, broadcast?

20:57.360 --> 20:59.360
If something happens, yes.

20:59.360 --> 21:03.360
Well, I guess no Xbox Live for Dan that night.

21:03.360 --> 21:04.360
Well, we'll figure something out.

21:04.360 --> 21:06.360
I'm pretty sure the internet will be up for us by then.

21:06.360 --> 21:08.360
Oh darn, I was gonna leave it on PSO.

21:08.360 --> 21:11.360
Bogged in, sitting there.

21:11.360 --> 21:16.360
It's really funny to go on PSO and just stand there and have people talk to you.

21:16.360 --> 21:19.360
Have you done that? Do you watch people talk to you?

21:19.360 --> 21:23.360
People come up, what level? Dot, dot, dot.

21:23.360 --> 21:25.360
Okay, dot, dot, dot.

21:25.360 --> 21:27.840
You know what people do on PSO that I find hilarious?

21:27.840 --> 21:31.520
Like, I went on PSO one night, and this guy was just running in a circle.

21:31.520 --> 21:33.720
He just ran in a circle around the lobby.

21:33.720 --> 21:35.720
He just kept running in a circle.

21:35.720 --> 21:38.200
And then, like, people would try to talk to him, and he just kept running.

21:38.200 --> 21:42.800
Like, he did that. I swear to God, I was sitting there for ten minutes and watched this guy just keep running in a circle.

21:42.800 --> 21:45.320
And then, finally, some guy started running behind him.

21:45.320 --> 21:51.960
And pretty soon, I got in on it, too, and then, like, six of us were all running in a giant circle.

21:51.960 --> 21:57.960
It was like a big fucking PSO conga line. It was like the nerdiest thing I'd ever seen in my entire life.

21:57.960 --> 22:04.960
Speaking of online games, and this only goes out to the smart people, which are basically all of our listeners are smart, because they're listening to us.

22:04.960 --> 22:16.960
If you go to squareenixusa.com, you can sign up, you can register to beta test Final Fantasy XI for PC or PS2.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.960
Uh, you're right.

22:18.960 --> 22:20.960
A PS2? That's funny.

22:20.960 --> 22:25.960
That's a hilarious joke. I signed up for the PC one.

22:25.960 --> 22:34.960
Because you know what? When Final Fantasy XI came out, first of all, my first impression was, this is the biggest pile of suck there could be.

22:34.960 --> 22:43.960
And then the other thing was, I want to play it. If I get Final Fantasy XI, I have to have a hard drive. Maybe I can convince Dan to work that into the villas, get a hard drive for my PC.

22:43.960 --> 22:57.960
Square should just say, okay, you know, this game really sucked ass. Maxis, what can we do to make this game better?

22:57.960 --> 23:08.960
Fucking... No, fucking, we need Sims mixed with, you know, Final Fantasy. It's awesome. Sims is addicting. People love it. You know, they love creating shit, making new skins and all that crap.

23:08.960 --> 23:15.960
But just, you know, with Final Fantasy, you have a little bit of fighting, a little bit of this, a little bit of that. It sounds good. I don't know.

23:15.960 --> 23:17.960
Final Fantasy X was good.

23:17.960 --> 23:23.960
Damn it, they're remaking all these Final Fantasy games, so why don't they remake Final Fantasy VI and CG Lock for me?

23:23.960 --> 23:26.960
That'd be cool. And Shadow.

23:26.960 --> 23:43.960
On a really random note, this kind of relates to Final Fantasy X, I was watching the new Christina Aguilera video last night, there's a new one, but it's like, it's really dark. Like, she had one of Marilyn Manson's video directors direct it, and now she's a slut in a corset, right?

23:43.960 --> 23:49.960
Yeah, but that has to explain it for me, because I'm TV-deprived.

23:49.960 --> 23:52.960
Is that the one where she turns in, like, a moth?

23:52.960 --> 23:54.960
She's like stuck to a wall and then all the butterflies attack her.

23:54.960 --> 23:56.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:56.960 --> 24:01.960
All I could think of was like, wow, she really does kind of look like Riku.

24:01.960 --> 24:04.960
I kind of have to see that if she dies. Did she die?

24:04.960 --> 24:06.960
I don't think she died in the video, no.

24:06.960 --> 24:07.960
But she gets attacked.

24:07.960 --> 24:09.960
She gets attacked by, like, butterflies.

24:09.960 --> 24:10.960
I might have to see that.

24:10.960 --> 24:15.040
I don't really she doesn't really get attacked. It's supposed to be her coming out for cocoon

24:16.440 --> 24:18.440
symbolic crack

24:20.640 --> 24:25.140
She's going in her cocoon she's going in this assistant crack whore and coming out crack whore

24:26.160 --> 24:32.940
No, she's going in as a crack whore. That means people pay for her. Uh-huh coming out as crack slut

24:33.240 --> 24:35.240
No one wants to pay for her

24:35.240 --> 24:42.240
You got to think of how many diseases you would catch.

24:43.240 --> 24:46.240
That's where the full body condom comes into play.

24:47.240 --> 24:50.240
Straight out of a freaking naked gun.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.240
I see that Aggie Vera has cuties.

24:53.240 --> 25:00.740
So yeah, Orange Lounge Radio is going to be a new studio in the new world headquarters

25:00.740 --> 25:06.900
in Folsom, California with a scenic view of Folsom State Prison.

25:06.900 --> 25:07.900
Coming to you in two weeks.

25:07.900 --> 25:10.140
Well, you can't really see the prison, but we're right next to the dam so we can laugh

25:10.140 --> 25:14.140
at them in case if the dam gets blown up and then they flood Sacramento, we can just go,

25:14.140 --> 25:15.140
ha ha!

25:15.140 --> 25:16.140
You're getting flooded, we're on the hill.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.140
Ha, you suck!

25:17.140 --> 25:19.980
Hey, if that happens, videotape it for me or just call me.

25:19.980 --> 25:20.980
I'll come over.

25:20.980 --> 25:21.980
Okay.

25:21.980 --> 25:22.980
I'll be there watching.

25:22.980 --> 25:26.980
And it'll be a great excuse to work the word damn into our show as many times.

25:26.980 --> 25:27.980
Damn that damn!

25:27.980 --> 25:30.980
We're actually right next to the damn road.

25:30.980 --> 25:33.980
Right by the damn nursery.

25:33.980 --> 25:37.980
Yeah, come over, we live right by the damn road.

25:37.980 --> 25:40.980
My brother was little when I went to Arizona to visit my mom.

25:40.980 --> 25:42.980
We went to Vegas.

25:42.980 --> 25:46.980
My brother seriously would call it the Hoover Darn.

25:46.980 --> 25:49.980
Because damn is a bad word.

25:49.980 --> 25:51.980
Oh! Oh, gee!

25:51.980 --> 25:53.980
Isn't that weird?

25:53.980 --> 25:56.980
We're gonna have so much stuff wired in that, um, new market.

25:56.980 --> 25:58.980
I have good news, by the way.

25:58.980 --> 25:59.980
Yes?

25:59.980 --> 26:01.980
I'm gonna say this right now because I brought up my brother.

26:01.980 --> 26:05.980
I got word that my brother who was in the, with the supply group with the Marines

26:05.980 --> 26:08.980
is coming back around June 21st.

26:08.980 --> 26:11.980
Which, cause they're the first to go and last to leave, so that'll...

26:11.980 --> 26:12.980
From where?

26:12.980 --> 26:14.980
From Iraq. He's in Iraq now, thank you.

26:14.980 --> 26:16.980
I don't know.

26:16.980 --> 26:24.500
yeah he's a marine stupid i love him anyway no i always thought the marines were like this elite

26:24.500 --> 26:28.180
fighting force yet you see keep hearing more and more and more and more and more of them

26:28.180 --> 26:33.780
you know being made i i don't know are they just like because they're on the front they're the

26:33.780 --> 26:41.060
front so they're they they're first operation getting first in first out i can't believe you

26:41.060 --> 27:01.060
What's interesting is that one goes out and another goes in. Our friend, the other Jamie, we know, is going in. As one goes out, one goes in. Hope they don't make her do too many push-ups, but you know, does the body good.

27:01.060 --> 27:02.060
uh...

27:02.060 --> 27:05.500
i think that's actually from the military and i'm glad that

27:05.500 --> 27:06.900
as horrible as it is

27:06.900 --> 27:10.020
to be run over at thirteen and have your leg put back on

27:10.020 --> 27:15.860
i'm glad that dam was run over and had his leg put back on because there's no possible way he could ever serve in the military

27:15.860 --> 27:18.460
you know it's interesting and this has absolutely nothing to do with our show

27:18.460 --> 27:20.580
but whatever who cares porn

27:20.580 --> 27:22.100
yeah porn no

27:22.100 --> 27:24.740
no this is not my dad not porn god

27:24.740 --> 27:28.620
my dad was not able to go to the korean my dad's a little bit older than

27:28.620 --> 27:33.660
probably a lot of your daddy's he was gonna go to the Korean War and they sent

27:33.660 --> 27:39.700
him home because he has an extra vertebrae whoa I would think he'd be in

27:39.700 --> 27:44.020
there it's like damn man if he gets hurt take one out he's normal it makes me

27:44.020 --> 27:46.980
wonder though if I got that like I need to have somebody count I've never had a

27:46.980 --> 27:50.180
doctor count like see if I have extra vertebrae have a certain amount I just

27:50.180 --> 27:51.180
I thought they were just there.

27:51.180 --> 27:52.180
Yeah.

27:52.180 --> 27:53.180
Crazy, huh?

27:53.180 --> 27:54.180
What?

27:54.180 --> 27:55.180
Yeah.

27:55.180 --> 27:56.180
Let's all count.

27:56.180 --> 27:57.180
Actually...

27:57.180 --> 27:58.180
Let me take my shirt off.

27:58.180 --> 28:01.340
I recommend that you do this while you're driving.

28:01.340 --> 28:03.340
It's just awesome.

28:03.340 --> 28:04.900
Rob, keep your shirt on.

28:04.900 --> 28:06.620
I've seen you in a corset.

28:06.620 --> 28:08.940
So have I, unfortunately.

28:08.940 --> 28:09.940
So have I.

28:09.940 --> 28:10.940
That was...

28:10.940 --> 28:14.980
Thank God it's a radio show, because I'm wearing it right now.

28:14.980 --> 28:18.980
I was bored one day, and I was just like browsing the area, and I was like, you know, I'll read

28:18.980 --> 28:23.980
I read live journals, read live journals, saw a link to the site, saw the pictures, I was like...

28:23.980 --> 28:27.980
But actually, you know what's funny? My friend Sean thinks he knows you.

28:27.980 --> 28:31.980
Because he used to do Rocky down at the Birdcage.

28:31.980 --> 28:32.980
You think you know him?

28:32.980 --> 28:34.980
And he thinks he knows you, too.

28:34.980 --> 28:36.980
I never did Rocky.

28:36.980 --> 28:41.980
Oh, you never did Rocky. Okay, he doesn't know you, then. He knows Jessica, maybe. I don't know.

28:41.980 --> 28:45.980
We'll talk off air, because I bet our listeners really don't give a shit.

28:45.980 --> 28:49.020
What do you mean? Who cares what they want? I did conventions!

28:49.020 --> 28:54.020
I'm a cosplayer! Yay!

28:54.020 --> 29:04.020
Okay. So? What was the point? What's the point? That means I'm gonna go around and kill people, because cosplayers eventually go psycho, because one little thing goes wrong, and they go around killing everyone! Not really.

29:10.020 --> 29:12.060
I need a machete.

29:12.060 --> 29:14.060
You need a machete? Why?

29:14.060 --> 29:16.060
I'm starting customer service.

29:16.060 --> 29:18.060
Oh, your job starts tomorrow, huh?

29:18.060 --> 29:20.060
No, it starts next Monday.

29:20.060 --> 29:26.060
Oh, good. We have another week of fuck-off shows on Orange Lounge Radio that go till five in the morning.

29:26.060 --> 29:41.060
No, no. See, me staying up till five in the morning, and then waking up at seven a.m., going back to sleep, getting up at ten a.m., going back to sleep...

29:41.060 --> 29:47.060
I can't do this business of staying up till eight in the morning. I was staying up till eight in the morning on average.

29:47.060 --> 29:52.060
You know what, last night I went to bed and the sun was coming up and I was like, God, I haven't done this in a long time.

29:52.060 --> 29:59.060
Rob, I went to bed when the sun was already high overhead, so I did something really stupid.

29:59.060 --> 30:08.060
I stayed up all day and all night, and I was inspired to write lots of fun stuff too.

30:08.060 --> 30:09.060
Really?

30:09.060 --> 30:21.060
I didn't write a damn thing because every time I start typing, I'd be like, why did I just type in Russian?

30:21.060 --> 30:29.060
That's the most entertaining thing to do is you start typing and you start writing something and you're really, really tired and then you go back and read it and you're like, what the hell?

30:29.060 --> 30:35.060
No, when I'm sleep deprived, I make the funniest typos. It's great. I started keeping a log of my typos.

30:35.060 --> 30:40.120
I have a breaking news announcement.

30:40.120 --> 30:43.960
Violent Hyper Girl, you may know her from Fremont II, she was the one, if you've seen

30:43.960 --> 30:47.200
pictures from the Fremont II tournament, she was whipping me.

30:47.200 --> 30:52.320
She is coming to Davis for college, which means puppy has someone to play with so he

30:52.320 --> 30:56.480
won't get so bored, and somebody to meet us for boba.

30:56.480 --> 30:57.560
But guess what?

30:57.560 --> 31:00.320
I am getting another breaking news.

31:00.320 --> 31:02.280
There's a Tap X in Sacramento now.

31:02.280 --> 31:03.280
Where?

31:03.280 --> 31:04.560
Pocket Road in a shopping center.

31:04.560 --> 31:11.560
Skyline, find the address and give it to us NOW.

31:11.560 --> 31:24.560
As Dark Tetsuya said earlier, is this going to be one of those shows? It's always one of those shows.

31:24.560 --> 31:28.120
All right, we can talk about Bomani news, and I'll make it quick. Oh

31:29.680 --> 31:35.320
Well, no, let's take a break before we do the news we got to tease the body of you tease the nice tease

31:43.280 --> 31:47.360

31:48.080 --> 31:50.080
Because we have a special one

31:50.080 --> 31:56.080
Okay, we can tease this. I'm gonna play... I don't know the quality of this MP3, I just got it.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.080
It's crap!

31:57.080 --> 32:00.080
But you can... yeah, it's MP3. It's crap, though.

32:00.080 --> 32:03.080
Okay, it's a crap one, but we'll try it. It's from Guitar Freaks. This is one of the Guitar Freaks.

32:03.080 --> 32:04.080
Oh, this is pretty good quality.

32:04.080 --> 32:09.080
Okay, good. This is the brand new B4U song from Guitar Freaks 9th of Drum Media 8th.

32:09.080 --> 32:14.080
We'll see if it's any good or not. Chikara, I haven't heard this yet. Is it bad? We'll see.

32:14.080 --> 32:15.080
We're gonna take a quick break.

32:15.080 --> 32:16.080
B4U, what do you expect?

32:16.080 --> 32:21.080
Okay, we'll be back after a quick break, and we're gonna talk about the Mani news, oh my God!

33:46.080 --> 34:01.720
Okay, Jamie has a quick announcement.

34:51.720 --> 34:52.720
24

34:52.720 --> 34:53.720
25

34:53.720 --> 34:54.720
26

34:54.720 --> 34:55.720
27

34:55.720 --> 34:56.720
28

34:56.720 --> 34:57.720

34:57.720 --> 34:58.720
30

34:58.720 --> 34:59.720
31

34:59.720 --> 35:00.720
32

35:30.720 --> 35:49.320
And now something I want to hear, Suffer.

Run, Go, Run Man 22,

35:59.660 --> 36:01.660
Now Go Go Go

36:11.680 --> 36:14.280
Careful like this is the word

36:14.300 --> 36:16.300
Don't risk your time

36:16.340 --> 36:18.340
Don't never stop

36:18.340 --> 36:24.340
Shouldn't know, God I'm strong Shouldn't know, God to the top

36:24.340 --> 36:28.340

37:39.840 --> 37:47.360
Yari koi, yari koi, ojigori karata nara o

37:49.360 --> 37:54.080
Yamanoda, are you a princess now?

38:24.080 --> 38:47.840
Okay, we've been getting a lot of requests for this this week, so I'm going to play this

38:47.840 --> 38:49.240
one more time.

38:49.240 --> 38:53.720
Loki's mix for Slagwerk called the Dark Sakura will fuck you up mix.

38:53.720 --> 38:55.120
And Loki, where can they download this?

38:55.120 --> 38:57.960
Fuck if I know, I forgot to put it online.

38:57.960 --> 38:58.960
Oops.

38:58.960 --> 39:01.360
People have been asking me for it when I randomly go in chat room.

39:01.360 --> 39:05.840
Yeah, if you beg Dark Sakura or myself, because I actually got a copy of it now in the chat

39:05.840 --> 39:07.320
room from Jamie, thank you.

39:07.320 --> 39:11.160
If you beg one of us for a copy, not during a show, not during a show because we're too

39:11.160 --> 39:14.720
busy doing the show to send files, but if you beg us for one outside of show hours,

39:14.720 --> 39:19.060
we will send you a copy of this lovely mix of Slagwerk by Loki.

39:19.060 --> 39:22.060
And this fucking rocks. Nice job, Loki.

39:22.060 --> 39:24.060
It's... it's... it's...

39:24.060 --> 39:27.060
It's definitely worthy of the name Dark Sacral Will Fuck You Up.

39:27.060 --> 39:30.060
It's the first good mix I've ever received.

39:30.060 --> 39:32.060
Dark Sacral, what will you fuck up today?

39:33.060 --> 39:35.060
What will I fuck up?

39:35.060 --> 39:37.060
Awww! Jamie needs a hug!

39:37.060 --> 39:40.060
I'll make your world up!

39:40.060 --> 39:42.060
You're supposed to say the Easter Bunny.

39:42.060 --> 39:44.060
I don't want to fuck the Easter Bunny!

39:44.060 --> 39:45.060
Not!

39:45.060 --> 39:46.060
I agree.

40:15.060 --> 40:22.060
This is fucked up.

40:22.060 --> 40:29.060
This is fucked up.

40:29.060 --> 40:39.060
This is fucked up.

40:39.060 --> 40:44.060
This is fucked up!

40:49.060 --> 40:51.060
This is fucked up!

40:51.060 --> 41:20.740
From the Step Squad to Orange Labs, this PDR sucks!

41:20.740 --> 41:34.300
And all those other acronyms I don't understand.

41:34.300 --> 41:35.300
Big hello to StepSquad.

41:35.300 --> 41:37.300
Any of you folks listening?

41:37.300 --> 41:38.300
Yes.

41:38.300 --> 41:43.760
A big hello to all of you listening because we love the people that listen to Orange Launch

41:43.760 --> 41:48.240
Radio and that means you.

41:48.240 --> 41:53.320
If you would like to join in the fun, the big gangbang orgy in our chatroom, I mean,

41:53.320 --> 41:57.080
well, it's a Mississippi orgy because nobody in there is wearing shoes right now.

41:57.080 --> 41:58.080
Yes.

41:58.080 --> 42:01.800
The law is no socks, no shoes, and people of multiple genders.

42:01.800 --> 42:04.040
All three or four or five of them.

42:04.040 --> 42:05.040
That's a Mississippi orgy.

42:05.040 --> 42:06.040
That's a Mississippi orgy.

42:06.040 --> 42:08.640
We had a Mississippi orgy at my house the other night.

42:08.640 --> 42:13.400
And then we kill each other with paper plates and magic markers and candles.

42:13.400 --> 42:17.780
If you want to join in the big Mississippi orgy that is our chatroom, head on over to

42:17.780 --> 42:24.780
www.calibomani.com

42:47.780 --> 42:52.780
That was so easy.

42:52.780 --> 42:55.780
I hate to say it, but you do get to sing for that.

42:55.780 --> 42:57.780
Bitch.

42:57.780 --> 42:59.780
Love you too.

42:59.780 --> 43:02.780
No, when I saw it for the first time, it was kind of close, actually.

43:02.780 --> 43:08.780
For the first time today, I saw G4 TV.

43:08.780 --> 43:11.780
Because my parents have it, believe it or not.

43:11.780 --> 43:12.780
Did it suck?

43:12.780 --> 43:14.780
It was interesting.

43:14.780 --> 43:21.660
You know we have game pro TV on a no game pro TV was not on I watched a show I watched something called

43:27.960 --> 43:29.960

43:35.500 --> 43:39.380
That's still laughing um I watched I watched a show called

43:39.380 --> 43:46.380
called, um, Blister, I think it was, with this guy who thought he was funny, who wasn't.

43:46.380 --> 43:50.380
And, um, what was the other show I watched? Something called Cheat. Yeah, it was Cheat.

43:50.380 --> 43:52.380
That's what it was called. And it was just them giving a lot of...

43:52.380 --> 43:55.380
Cheat is not dead!

43:55.380 --> 43:58.380
That's where Homestar Runner's gonna sell out to, G4.

43:58.380 --> 44:01.380
Just a glass! Just a glass, Dad!

44:01.380 --> 44:08.380
This is the funny thing, though. They didn't get a, um...

44:35.020 --> 44:36.020
You got me.

44:36.020 --> 44:37.020
You bitch.

44:37.020 --> 44:38.020
All right.

44:38.020 --> 44:43.020
Speak up my ass.

44:43.020 --> 44:44.020
Speak up my ass?

44:44.020 --> 44:45.020
We're running through the fucking mixing board.

44:45.020 --> 44:47.020
No one has to speak up.

44:47.020 --> 44:49.020
You turn your damn speakers up, okay?

44:49.020 --> 44:53.020
I don't want to speak up my ass.

44:53.020 --> 44:55.020
Anyway, oh, doorbell.

44:55.020 --> 44:58.020
G4, really quick, because I know we have news we want to get to.

44:58.020 --> 44:59.020
It was interesting.

44:59.020 --> 45:00.020
We do?

45:00.020 --> 45:02.020
Our show would work on G4.

45:02.020 --> 45:04.020
Because we don't suck.

45:04.020 --> 45:08.020
I wouldn't say G4 sucks. They're just new. They're in their infancy.

45:08.020 --> 45:10.020
We need the next channel, G5.

45:10.020 --> 45:11.020
We need...

45:11.020 --> 45:12.020
I want G69.

45:12.020 --> 45:13.020
We need...

45:13.020 --> 45:15.020
Irene!

45:15.020 --> 45:17.020
Oh, Irene's here.

45:17.020 --> 45:22.020
And how dare they name that channel after a really shitty Macintosh computer. That's what I want to know.

45:22.020 --> 45:24.020
You know...

45:24.020 --> 45:26.020
Is it just you, or is Brad with you?

45:26.020 --> 45:28.020
Brad's coming later. He's still up at G4.

45:28.020 --> 45:29.020
Oh, okay.

45:29.020 --> 45:34.020
You know, I could talk about Max, but that's getting into my fuck you of the week involving Julie's computer.

45:34.020 --> 45:42.020
Promises that we do Bomani news when we came in back to this break, so I'll hand it off to Loki because he always has something to say Bomani related.

45:42.020 --> 45:54.020
Gee, horrible surprise! We found out that DDR USA, or Max USA stuff, like, um, you know, Overblast, Peace Out, and, uh, there's one more, I think Jam of Marmalade.

45:54.020 --> 45:57.620
Marmalade. Guess what? Those are going to be Max 2. Oh, surprise! Didn't call that like

45:57.620 --> 46:03.700
a few weeks ago. Retards using old stuff again, but whatever. That's cool. We're going to

46:03.700 --> 46:07.420
hopefully see these in the next arcade version because I want to play Jam Marmalade on the

46:07.420 --> 46:13.780
arcade. But yeah, that's what's coming. Basically, you get an update every Thursday or Friday,

46:13.780 --> 46:17.700
I believe, on their Max 2 site. They update it every week. And supposedly, this coming

46:17.700 --> 46:23.420
up week, will be new codes for DDR Extreme. Supposedly, it will be the last codes, but

46:23.420 --> 46:26.860
Who really gives a shit?

46:26.860 --> 46:32.020
Fucking roulette! Fucking roulette! I hate you roulette!

46:32.020 --> 46:33.520
Well, I'll bit into that later.

46:33.520 --> 46:38.280
Yes, it's not time for the fuck use of a roulette.

46:38.280 --> 46:41.960
Jamming Marmalade? What?

46:41.960 --> 46:45.840
I didn't read anything. Oh yeah, it's rumored to be on there, I think. Or no, wait.

46:45.840 --> 46:48.480
Oh, more paranoia, yay!

46:48.480 --> 46:50.560
Yeah.

46:50.560 --> 46:54.000
paranoia survivors rumored to be an unlock on max 2

46:54.000 --> 46:55.560
but guess what

46:55.560 --> 46:58.040
guess what glacial is

46:58.040 --> 47:05.040
glacial is was a character in killer instinct

47:05.300 --> 47:07.080
no

47:07.080 --> 47:09.900
it's uh...

47:09.900 --> 47:11.320
uh...

47:11.320 --> 47:14.720
it's a cover song it's a cover song that might be for you it's an english song

47:14.720 --> 47:15.560
uh...

47:15.560 --> 47:17.960
i can't remember what the song is

47:17.960 --> 47:26.960
It's a B4U cover of A Song. I can't remember, I posted about it like a while ago, but it's just escaped my mind right now.

47:26.960 --> 47:29.960
Oh, if we go to the Max 2 side, I can tell you, because it says on it.

47:29.960 --> 47:35.960
That's a future listless topic and waiting. B4U, the song we'd like to see B4U ruin.

47:35.960 --> 47:40.960
I'll tell you what I'm worried about in the Mani news is freaking 9th Style.

47:40.960 --> 47:43.960
9th Style, it's funny you bring that up. There is some...

47:43.960 --> 47:46.960
I want more tack, and I want more tack now.

47:46.960 --> 47:50.140
There are some tracks that have been leaked to the internet.

47:50.140 --> 47:52.020
However, they're of a crappy quality.

47:52.020 --> 47:54.520
But I'm going to play some clips for you guys anyway.

47:54.520 --> 47:57.100
The reason why these are crappy quality is this is literally some guy

47:57.100 --> 48:00.460
with a tape recorder walking into a Japanese arcade

48:00.460 --> 48:03.300
to tape these for you guys and distribute them over the internet.

48:03.300 --> 48:06.380
And bimonistyle.com sent them out to everybody.

48:06.380 --> 48:08.780
And now everybody's got these, I think, by now.

48:08.780 --> 48:10.460
But we're going to play some just in case you don't have some.

48:10.460 --> 48:12.140
We'll play little clips.

48:12.140 --> 48:15.500
This first one is a song called Distress, which

48:15.500 --> 48:21.500
Is Taka remixed by Tack? We're just going to play a little clip of it.

48:21.500 --> 48:24.500
Is it Tack remixed by Tack? Well, either way, it's pretty much Outfazed.

48:24.500 --> 48:25.500
It's Outfazed-y.

48:25.500 --> 48:31.500
So, let's hear a little clip, because this is kind of bad quality. We apologize, but it's all we got right now, but you can get a feel for it.

48:31.500 --> 48:50.020
you can hear it you can hear that guitar sound in it that's in every tax on like a

48:50.020 --> 48:56.020
remix of like stoic mixed with like diamond jealousy and like Yamaoka I know

48:56.020 --> 48:57.860
But that's why I'm saying what it sounds like.

49:00.740 --> 49:03.660
My tack door went off.

49:03.660 --> 49:04.740
Tack door.

49:04.740 --> 49:08.820
I'm now, I have to clean up, excuse me.

49:08.820 --> 49:10.900
OK, while she's cleaning up, let's play a little bit of

49:10.900 --> 49:11.900
the Abyss remix.

49:11.900 --> 49:13.740
This is Abyss, the Heavens mix.

49:13.740 --> 49:16.940
And if you remember Ryu, who did Star Mine in fourth mix,

49:16.940 --> 49:18.300
he's the guy who remixed this.

49:18.300 --> 49:19.900
So we'll hear a little clip of this.

49:19.900 --> 49:37.300
It doesn't sound a goddamn thing like the original.

49:37.300 --> 49:43.900
Judging by the key presses, which I heard very loudly, that's either a five or six.

49:43.900 --> 49:45.740
Could have been light seven, just to throw you, though.

49:45.740 --> 49:48.140
In fact, if they're recording it, they probably did it in light seven.

49:48.140 --> 49:52.780
seven me trying to play a seven star song okay this one i'm really excited about this

49:52.780 --> 49:56.560
is the new ping pong song power dream and this song really kicks ass i'm looking forward

49:56.560 --> 50:07.560
to hearing the better quality version of this

50:07.560 --> 50:23.040
That just totally sounds like digital mind.

50:23.040 --> 50:24.040
A little bit.

50:24.040 --> 50:25.040
A little bit.

50:25.040 --> 50:28.120
But it's got its own happy carnival...

50:28.120 --> 50:30.520
If it's tack, it's not happy.

50:30.520 --> 50:31.720
Virtual mind.

50:31.720 --> 50:32.720
I'm sorry.

50:32.720 --> 50:33.720
Yes.

50:33.720 --> 50:34.720
There you go.

50:34.720 --> 50:35.720
Okay.

50:35.720 --> 50:36.720
Okay.

50:36.720 --> 50:39.720
If it's tack, it's not happy.

50:39.720 --> 50:40.800
Shit, what's that other one?

50:40.800 --> 50:42.040
Mind Parasite.

50:42.040 --> 50:44.360
I knew it had mind in it, god damn it.

50:44.360 --> 50:47.320
Mind Parasite, it sounds just like Mind Parasite.

50:47.320 --> 50:48.080
OK, you sure?

50:48.080 --> 50:49.080
You sure this time?

50:49.080 --> 50:50.440
Positive.

50:50.440 --> 50:52.240
No, wait, it's, it's.

50:52.240 --> 50:56.120
It's Mind Over Matter, I don't know.

50:56.120 --> 50:57.200
I've lost my mind.

50:57.200 --> 50:59.360
They're coming to take me away, ha ha.

50:59.360 --> 51:01.440
Next one we were going to preview for you, the last one

51:01.440 --> 51:02.960
we're going to preview for you, this is Prelude.

51:02.960 --> 51:04.400
And this is one I'm excited about.

51:04.400 --> 51:05.480
This is the new Naoki Underground song.

51:05.480 --> 51:07.480
I'm excited about the other one.

51:07.480 --> 51:08.480
What?

51:08.480 --> 51:10.480
About the Mime Parasite.

51:10.480 --> 51:12.480
No, well I am, I'm, whatever.

51:12.480 --> 51:13.480
Let's just hear this one.

51:13.480 --> 51:14.480
Oh, I remember! Hold on!

51:14.480 --> 51:16.480
Yeah, stop for a sec.

51:16.480 --> 51:17.480
Glacial.

51:17.480 --> 51:22.480
It was going to be a cover by Ryukosuka of Hyperurby.

51:22.480 --> 51:24.480
Oh, God.

51:24.480 --> 51:25.480
That's what it is.

51:25.480 --> 51:27.480
Now I remembered.

51:27.480 --> 51:28.480
I actually like Hyperurby.

51:28.480 --> 51:30.480
There's one song I'm less excited about.

51:30.480 --> 51:32.480
All right.

51:32.480 --> 51:34.480
The new System SF song, yay, okay.

51:34.480 --> 51:39.480
Uh, here we go. This is a little clip of Prelude by Naoki on the Ground. This is my favorite so far, I think.

51:39.480 --> 52:05.480
I was like, yay, it's another classical piece.

52:05.480 --> 52:06.480
Yay, another classical piece.

52:06.480 --> 52:12.400
Yeah, it's vanity angel all over again now. I'm going to preview for you prelude featuring Polteri

52:18.960 --> 52:25.880
Rob yes, Rob. I'm sorry, but now you have to die give me that I

52:27.720 --> 52:32.720
Have two microphones now. It's no no what that that should be is prelude featuring

52:32.720 --> 52:40.720
If it was Prelude featuring someone farting, it would sound better than Polteri.

52:40.720 --> 52:42.720
Anyway...

52:42.720 --> 52:48.720
Prelude featuring my ass! Where's the burrito?

52:48.720 --> 52:56.720
Prelude featuring my bunghole!

52:56.720 --> 53:06.720
Another interesting bit of news here. I was given a tip, a lead, from a fellow in our chat room, goes by the name John Fields.

53:06.720 --> 53:13.720
Project Majestic Mix. I have no idea who that is, but I think they're a band.

53:13.720 --> 53:17.720
However, they have a newsletter, and this is what their newsletter says.

53:17.720 --> 53:30.720
In light of our new dance album in the works, some of you may be interested to know that we have obtained permission and are working, planning to include our very own DDR PC Max CD-ROM game as part of the limited edition extra.

53:30.720 --> 53:33.720
Your computer fell apart!

53:33.720 --> 53:36.720
Rob, is your computer feeling really fresh?

53:36.720 --> 53:42.720
You're laughing at the computer, not the story. My computer is just ghetto. Okay, let me finish. Can I finish? Can I finish?

53:42.720 --> 53:44.720
And?

53:44.720 --> 53:48.720
Majestic. Oh, they did remixes of Final Fantasy music.

53:48.720 --> 53:53.720
Anyway, the whole graphics, sound effects, music, and announcer voices are planned to be 100% original.

53:53.720 --> 53:59.720
We not only plan on including DDR versions of some of the new album music, but some remixes from our other album releases.

53:59.720 --> 54:04.720
Gee, that sounds like step mania to me, ass. Freaking idiots.

54:04.720 --> 54:08.720
Wait a minute. This could be officially Konami endorsed, though. That's the big deal about this.

54:08.720 --> 54:10.720
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Sure.

54:10.720 --> 54:15.720
Wait a minute though, wait a minute though. Would somebody who's putting out like a bonafide real album be that risky?

54:15.720 --> 54:18.720
It's gotta be blessed by Konami if they're gonna rip off a DDR interval.

54:18.720 --> 54:23.720
I'll have you know that my next track will be in the next DDR Max 3 for the home version, yes.

54:23.720 --> 54:29.720
It's a new track. In fact, it's all my music. They're giving me all the proceeds from that, yes.

54:29.720 --> 54:35.720
Could you listen to this part again, Loki? We have obtained permission. Which would mean Konami, right?

54:35.720 --> 54:42.720
It means we've obtained permission to remix their music, saying that we won't permission to slap you.

54:42.720 --> 54:43.720
That's all it says.

54:43.720 --> 54:46.720
That means look for a press kit, look for the press releases.

54:46.720 --> 54:49.720
It means don't jack shit.

54:49.720 --> 54:50.720
It means jack shit, exactly.

54:50.720 --> 54:57.720
It means that they've obtained permission to remix the official songs that they made from the DDR home versions.

54:57.720 --> 54:59.720
That's all it is.

54:59.720 --> 55:01.720
Can I remix this song?

55:01.720 --> 55:04.720
Sure, son, why not?

55:04.720 --> 55:07.720
Yay! I get to read it!

55:08.720 --> 55:10.720
I was just thinking if there was anything on their site.

55:10.720 --> 55:16.720
Whatever, you know, fine. If it is, yay, you know, whatever. DDR PC sucks anyways.

55:16.720 --> 55:19.720
Mr. Spanky!

55:19.720 --> 55:23.720
Well, we shall see what happens. Oh, maybe it's DDR Ultra Mix.

55:23.720 --> 55:27.720
Alright, Majestic Mix, if you're listening, surprise the pants off a Loki, because that would be funny.

55:27.720 --> 55:29.720
Maybe it's DDR Meow Mix.

55:29.720 --> 55:31.720
DDR Meow Mix?

55:31.720 --> 55:33.720
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

55:33.720 --> 55:36.720
Did you tell everyone about the Will and Grace episode?

55:36.720 --> 55:40.720
No, that was the next bit I was going to mention about. Why don't you tell us about it, Irene, since you brought it up?

55:40.720 --> 55:42.720
Oh, there was DDR and Will and Grace.

55:42.720 --> 55:44.720
You saw DDR on TV? No way.

55:44.720 --> 55:46.720
Yeah, it was so cool.

55:46.720 --> 55:51.720
Why don't you describe it for those folks that may not watch Will and Grace, or any TV at all, like Jamie?

55:51.720 --> 55:56.720
Will and Grace is gay. Yeah, it's about, you know, a fag and his...

55:56.720 --> 55:59.720
No, not the show, the episode.

55:59.720 --> 56:05.720
Well, it's Grace's birthday, and Jack and Karen take her out to an arcade, and there's a fifth mix, and they play it.

56:05.720 --> 56:07.720
What song do they play?

56:07.720 --> 56:14.720
Well, they don't play songs that are really in DDRX. Well, Jack plays Holiday, but not like the DDR version.

56:14.720 --> 56:16.720
I thought someone played Abyss or something.

56:16.720 --> 56:20.720
Well, it has the background to Abyss, which is funny. Holiday has Abyss's background, apparently.

56:20.720 --> 56:24.720
Yeah, like on the screen, it says Abyss, and he's playing Holiday.

56:24.720 --> 56:30.320
Like when she's going to play another game there was like puzzle fighter 2 or something like it was playing abyss in the background and

56:30.320 --> 56:34.260
It played dynamite rave also while the kid was playing a little kid was playing dynamite rave

56:37.160 --> 56:40.680
And then grace it was so funny to watch grace dance

56:40.680 --> 56:45.680
You make it sound like my anti-TV stance is, like, total social deprivation.

56:45.680 --> 56:46.680
It is.

56:46.680 --> 56:47.680
Well...

56:47.680 --> 56:50.680
Shut up and ask yourself the wrong!

56:50.680 --> 56:57.040
My life is much more enriched through reading fanfiction!

56:57.040 --> 56:59.040
I mean, books.

56:59.040 --> 57:01.880
But is DDR in your fanfic episodes?

57:01.880 --> 57:02.880
Ha!

57:02.880 --> 57:03.880
They could be.

57:03.880 --> 57:04.880
I could...

57:04.880 --> 57:09.000
I will put DDR in my next story, how's that?

57:09.000 --> 57:10.000
Fair enough.

57:10.000 --> 57:14.000
Let's see who comes through the door now. Who's going to get it? Loki!

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Oh, Brian's got it.

57:16.000 --> 57:21.000
I have no idea who's coming through the door.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
It's our Intern Zero.

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Hello, do you have anybody with you?

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
Um, yeah. This is Jim.

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
Hi, Jim.

57:29.000 --> 57:30.000
He's from Fremont.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
Hi, Jim from Fremont.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Everyone can say hi.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.000
And who else is here?

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
Anita.

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
Hi, Anita.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
Johnny.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
Hey, everybody.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.000
And Jason.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
What the hell? There's a party all of a sudden.

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
Yeah, we all fit in the clown car.

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
I'm sitting here going,

57:45.000 --> 57:49.000
Gee, we've got like only the three of us here in house and then all of a sudden everybody's showing up.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Yeah, the clown car's showing up.

57:51.000 --> 57:52.000
Hello.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
Sup everyone, this is Jim. Nice to meet you all.

57:54.000 --> 57:55.000
Do you play DDR at all?

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
I'm afraid to say no.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
You'll fit right in. Alright, Anita.

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
Hi, DDRcaholic here. How is everybody?

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Good, how's your DDR addiction?

58:04.000 --> 58:12.000
Oh, well, I'm on step nine of the 12-step program. It's coming along. It's coming along fine.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Remember, Nyquil's the thirteenth step.

58:14.000 --> 58:22.000
Nyquil is the thirteenth step, and I am almost ready with my case of Nyquil. I'm just waiting to open it.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
And we have...

58:24.000 --> 58:28.000
It's the child. God, I'm so fucking tired right now.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Well, how late did you stay up?

58:30.000 --> 58:31.000
Uh...

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Did you stay up to greet the Easter Bunny?

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
Easter Bunny?

58:34.000 --> 58:35.000
Yeah.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.840
I greeted the Easter Bunny all right.

58:37.840 --> 58:40.560
Where's my damn candy?

58:40.560 --> 58:43.960
Yeah, so anyway, DDR on Will and Grace.

58:43.960 --> 58:46.960
Ha, that was funny.

58:46.960 --> 58:47.960
On Will and Grace?

58:47.960 --> 58:53.040
It was a vidmix, and it was showing singles on the screen, but they were playing doubles,

58:53.040 --> 58:54.040
both of them.

58:54.040 --> 58:55.440
Like, Jack was on the completely wrong side.

58:55.440 --> 58:58.160
He was on the right side, and it was supposed to be on the left side of the screen.

58:58.160 --> 59:00.920
I like it when idiots pretend to be cool on TV.

59:00.920 --> 59:24.920
Who else is here? Oh, there's somebody in the hall!

59:24.920 --> 59:26.920
Oh, this is Bombay.

59:26.920 --> 59:28.920
I'm also tired.

59:28.920 --> 59:30.920
Me too.

59:30.920 --> 59:33.920
I got to beat your character up today in Soul Calibur.

59:33.920 --> 59:37.920
Did you beat her hard?

59:37.920 --> 59:39.920
I beat her long and hard.

59:39.920 --> 59:42.920
With my lesbian character.

59:42.920 --> 59:44.920
With the big titties. They're all lesbians.

59:44.920 --> 59:48.920
This is the first time I played Soul Calibur 2 in a long, long time.

59:48.920 --> 59:52.920
She's the dyke of the game. She's also the dominatrix.

59:52.920 --> 59:54.920
But then suddenly I was, I was...

59:54.920 --> 59:56.920
Shaggy is, she does whatever. She's good for anything.

59:57.920 --> 01:00:00.920
And then Cassandra's the quick lay. She does everybody.

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:04.920
Conquest came up and suddenly I'm fighting D-child. I'm like...

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:10.920
Did you, did you fight F-Yo Mama?

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:14.920
Uh, I don't remember fighting F-Yo Mama.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:20.920
That's it. You're going to find an achillic named Dark Sakura in there.

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:24.920
Okay, news flash.

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.920
Yeah, his special attribute is cheap bitch power.

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:31.920
News flash, we have the address to the new Tap-X from Skyline.

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:34.920
There's a Tap-X in Sacramento now, in South Sac.

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:37.920
Oh, bitches, my dad was going to make one and then they brought one here.

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:38.920
Yep.

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:41.920
Yeah, there's one in South Sac now, so we might go after the show.

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:50.920
Alright, I'd just like to say, coming from the Bay Area where there's real Boba and real Pearl Tea, Tapioca Express is gay.

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:52.920
It's all we got!

01:00:52.920 --> 01:01:00.920
It's really not that bad, I mean, I've tried some of the, that Boba that we had at that one place in Fremont, was that real Boba?

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:03.920
Okay, their Boba is just as good.

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.920
What, like lollipop?

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:06.920
I don't know.

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:42.200
Which I must say that this car, while being in the movie, was stock, and it just had a

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:48.600
nice paint job, which was sort of getting shipped, and actually someone stole the exhaust

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:49.600
off of it.

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:54.040
They physically cut the exhaust off with a hacksaw, that was hilarious.

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:59.020
But yeah, it was really cool, and no one could tell, but I took my friend Andy, who's kind

01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:02.440
of a fanatic about the whole thing, and he took pictures of him taking the car off of

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:06.800
the trailer and stuff, and then I took a picture inside the car. So I thought it'd be really

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:11.600
funny, because, you know, I was really bored that day, to post pictures online of me sitting

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:15.800
in the car telling people that I bought the car off of eBay. Because if anyone knows me,

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:21.060
I am just been buying shit off of eBay like crazy. So it's slightly believable. But then

01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:22.060
again, yeah.

01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:27.280
I first started getting suspicious when I saw it was parked on a sidewalk. But then

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:31.480
just to check on how much they were, it went on eBay. And those cars aren't at that price.

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:36.960
I saw a beamer that was like fully tricked out for under 30 grand and I mean beamers for under 30 grand. That's pretty good

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:41.640
Yeah, so anyways I had a couple people go in there for like a little bit

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:46.400
I was waiting for Rob because Rob I was thinking you know I see now

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:52.040
It was so much for afterthought, but um I was gonna say you know I should have posted yeah, Rob

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:57.400
I need the bar like five hundred dollars because I spent too much money on this, but instead no

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.400
No, I didn't do that, so that kind of thing.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:00.400
Oh, you're so kind.

01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:04.400
And he saw right through, because he knew me better. He knew that I'd buy a DDR machine before I'd buy a nice car, so...

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.400
Yeah.

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.400
I got you!

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.400
I try.

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.400
I'm fucking great.

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.400
Uh, okay, so...

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:15.400
Hmm.

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:16.400
Oh!

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:17.400
Any other mind news, you think?

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:18.400
Uh, Ultramix.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:19.400
Is there new news on Ultramix?

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:21.400
Uh, no.

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:23.400
Well, thanks!

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.400
Bravo!

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:34.840
fair and limbo. Um, shit, um, not really anything else. Um, well there's some news, I guess.

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:40.120
Oh, what about Turnimix 4? Turnimix 4 has been announced. It's going to be on June 15th.

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:49.480
That's all. That's all I've got. This is the date. Just June 15th. And um, and uh, oh yeah,

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:53.400
we were still going to be doing a TV show DWI contest, but um, we got lazy and haven't

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:58.400
I haven't really planned for it yet, so look for a big announcement at B3.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.400
Okay.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:00.400
Yes.

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:01.400
Yes, look for that.

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:05.400
That'll give us plenty of time to get up off our ass and do something.

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:07.400
There's also, well, a couple things.

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:11.400
Bomani's style, they've opened up, well, they're going to be opening up.

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.400
I haven't gotten my email yet.

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:17.400
But opening up a Leech server for all those who contributed to them, which I did.

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:20.400
So I will get access to a Leech server with a bunch of cool shit on.

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:21.400
Ooh, you're special.

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:22.400
I know I am.

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:38.400
And then there's also, let's see, this guy Shuey, who I've been working with, he's starting a project called, was it the DWI History project or whatever, anyways, he has up to date every single sim file that's ever been made, pretty much.

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:46.400
Another question coming from the chatroom from Skyline, are we going to E3? Probably not. Unless someone gives us tickets really fast.

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.400
I've been asking that in, um...

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:52.400
I can get the time off work in Jiffy, but...

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:55.400
I've been asking that, but I don't know.

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:05.400
I don't know. I have tickets for The Matrix Reloaded that day, so it's a gimme.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:07.400
I was like, I wanna see The Matrix.

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:13.400
I don't know. To be honest, I don't think I have the money to go to E3, but I would like to anyway.

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:14.400
I do. I wanna go.

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:27.400
Let's go hang out on the street corner in front of BE3 and see if we can't get in.

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:29.400
Okay!

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:33.400
We can film it and do wacky shit and disguise ourselves like stuff.

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.400
Hey, where's the wacky media?

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:41.400
We can pretend we're bombs and then the bomb fight people will pay us to beat each other up and I'll kick your ass.

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:45.400
And you know, someone with some kind of military-based first-person shooter is bound to be there.

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:49.400
We can just rob up like a booth babe.

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.400
I can be Riku.

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:58.400
With all the military games, just dress in camel and walk right in like you're part of the show.

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:04.400
Okay, we wanted to do a list list pretty soon here, but we need time to think about it.

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:08.400
Yeah, we need to do FUs of the Week still, and we need to do the Cage Match.

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:10.400
So, what first? Ffuse or cage match?

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.400
Ffuse.

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:16.400
Ffuse. Alright, fine. We're gonna go to a quick break, and we'll come back and do the Ffuse of the Week.

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:23.400
Okay, kids? So, you can send them over a private message to Muah, my name is Sky High, and I'm in the chat room.

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:24.400
Sky High!

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.400
Yes, Sky High. Very cute.

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:29.400
I made a bunny!

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:36.400
Yeah, I'm in the chat room and just send me your FUs of the week over private message and we'll get to those right when we come back.

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:44.400
In the meantime, here's that new special little Paranoia that's going to be in Max 2, or so they say, the Japanese home release coming out this week.

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:50.400
This is Paranoia Sur- and I have it on order too, with the VRare soundtrack. Yay!

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:54.400
Here's a cookie. Here's Paranoia Survivor, enjoy.

01:06:54.400 --> 01:07:01.400
enjoy

01:08:54.400 --> 01:09:19.520
I feel, I feel, I feel You are the only one, let me feel this way

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:39.240
I feel, I feel, I feel You are the only one that should be on the

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:43.240
Go on the other way, boy, let's leave it on the way

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:34.240
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:39.240
This server made up it's minding head number. This server made up it's minding head number.

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:06.240
I call you Squeenix because you suck.

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:15.240
Fuck you for not listening to me and for not listening to Michelle because we had this discussion earlier today.

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:20.240
Damn you for sucking so bad for not making Kingdom Hearts the way we want you to.

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:28.240
First of all, thank you for waiting until 2004 to release Kingdom Hearts 2.

01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:30.240
Bitches.

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:37.240
Damn you, for not taking advantage of your other licensing.

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:45.240
And I can tell you this right now, that if you do not take advantage of the Enix Association, and go and bless the moon characters on Kingdom Hearts 2,

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:49.240
I will personally go to Tokyo in a tank, and run you all over.

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:56.240
I will put collars on your necks, and enact battle royale, and then whoever wins the battle royale,

01:12:56.240 --> 01:13:01.240
I'll go, okay, you can go. We'll take the collar off and then I'll stick a knife in your head.

01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:05.240
Gosh, Jamie, you're really mean.

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:14.240
No, no, no, no, no. Before I put the knife in their head, I'll shave their balls with a cheese grater and pour alcohol on it.

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:17.240
She's productive, okay?

01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:19.240
I get results, yes.

01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:20.240
That's right.

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:21.240
And then once I...

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:23.240
You'll feed them the flakes first.

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:30.240
and

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:38.760
not wasting one thing

01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:42.020
and

01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:42.840
first of all

01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:44.220
i'm gonna give it a cool name

01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:47.680
it'll be called

01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:48.980
spike

01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:55.980
It'll be called, um, Not Squee Mix, how's that?

01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:59.980
And then, once I've taken it over, I'm gonna make my own freakin' RPG,

01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:04.980
because I'm gonna take advantage of all those licenses, and because of the association with Sony,

01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:09.980
Sony's got their fingers in everything, I'm gonna have the ultimate RPG.

01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:14.980
I can think of one thing they don't have their fingers in.

01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:17.980
I'm just sayin'!

01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:25.980
And then, and then, and then, I'm going to make my own gaming system, because nothing that's out right now will be able to use it.

01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:30.980
And then I'm going to take over Gravity and make Ragnarok Online cool.

01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:33.980
I'm not making an Xbox.

01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:39.980
...for them, you know, they're like, fuck you all, we're making it for our system, you can't have it unless you buy our expensive system.

01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:43.980
All I heard Jamie say was I'm taking over Gravity.

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:47.980
Like, now she's taking out the force. Mother Nature, burn!

01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:53.980
Yeah, fuck you Nature. I'm rewriting physics, dammit. I've got the mole diver power.

01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:58.980
Anyway, my next budget of the week goes toward this troll who was on the road behind me.

01:14:58.980 --> 01:14:59.980
There's more?

01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:01.980
There's more.

01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:05.980
This... and it gets... and it gets...

01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:08.980
Again, I'm not a shallow person, usually.

01:15:08.980 --> 01:15:12.980
This person made me think that Trogdor was gorgeous.

01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:16.980
This person...

01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:20.980
This person made Corky in the Wonder Years.

01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:23.980
You mean, uh, Life Goes On?

01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:24.980
Life Goes On.

01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:26.980
Looked like a beauty queen.

01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:33.980
I missed America.

01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:35.980
And then this bitch...

01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:36.980
What?

01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:46.980
She decides to tailgate me, going from my apartment to Gero's, and then gets me out of the way and I'm like, yo, I'm gonna pass her?

01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:54.980
So, I start going, when she's right behind me, I start going five miles an hour on Gero's.

01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:58.980
She's these, I go 50.

01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:05.980
I was like, bless you, car, for having some acceleration this time. Let's hear it for high oxygen gas.

01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:08.540
my other fuck you of the week

01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:10.620
goes toward not having money

01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:15.620
until after i work some more

01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:19.620
we wouldn't have fuck yous of the week if it was for me

01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:24.340
it goes toward not having money so i couldn't go to the fact of the last three yesterday

01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:29.340

however i did get lots of neat stuff

01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:34.020

01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:41.020

My F.U. of the Week.

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:14.080
My F.U. of the Week goes to Madonna because Madonna, you bitch, that new video you have

01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:16.800
for American life sucks my balls.

01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:20.220
It is the worst, most unimaginative thing I've ever seen in my life.

01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:24.020
original video was better way way better you know it wasn't the best video you've

01:22:24.020 --> 01:22:27.340
done but it was way better than that piece of shit you put on vh1 you know

01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:29.980
if you don't want to ruffle feathers with the whole anti-war thing even

01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:35.260
though the video is an anti-war it's all like tongue-in-cheek anyway just spend

01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:39.980
$50 at least to make a decent video I did college projects that were better

01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:44.220
than that shit Madonna you suck but the album comes out Tuesday and I'm buying

01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:48.500

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:10.300
only focus

01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:11.780
on that one

01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:14.180
you the picture for

01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:22.180
that your brains are attached to, and your whole life depends on, and you have those social experiences, and you don't even see them, and you don't even have no idea what you're talking about. Next.

01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:28.180
Don't you do that when you play, um, the fantasy card, playing that fantasy card, is that a talent passing or not?

01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:34.180
First of all, I've gotten, um, maybe to, uh, the save point after you do the daibii thing.

01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:37.180
Yes. No, you're not there.

01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:43.180
Yeah, you were there. I got to the daibii card, and then I saved, and I haven't played since.

01:23:43.180 --> 01:23:45.180
The computer does it, too.

01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:48.180
Fuck Final Fantasy II International, by the way.

01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:51.180
For being easy. Oh my god.

01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:53.180
Let's move on to the rest of the room chatroom.

01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:54.180
Or, the rest of the room FUs.

01:23:54.180 --> 01:23:55.180
Zero!

01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:58.180
Oh, that's really cool. I have, like, a Madonna FU, too.

01:23:58.180 --> 01:23:59.180
Okay.

01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:03.180
It's pretty sad. No, today, I was watching... television!

01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:09.180
And, anyways, um, they were talking about how she's trying to make a, uh, uh, effort against...

01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:11.180
Okay, fuck TV.

01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:27.180
Anyways, yeah, like I was trying to say as she hops out of the room, she's trying to combat music piracy also, she had a bunch of people get online, and she has her actual voice, where you'll download the full length of the song, right?

01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:32.180
But it'll just start off the first six seconds, the only thing it'll say, what the fuck do you think you're doing?

01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:34.180
That was fucking great, actually.

01:24:34.180 --> 01:24:39.180
It's funny, but it's like, you really think you're gonna do something.

01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:43.180
You know, she's not the only one doing that, though. I tried to download the new JUUL single. Don't ask me why, I just was.

01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:45.180
And it did the same thing.

01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:48.180
Well, you see, if she wasn't going, what the fuck are you looking at? It just looped the chorus over and over.

01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:52.180
And I've got no doubts on it that people are doing that, all the stuff.

01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:56.180
Yeah, you know what? That's not going to stop anything. You can do whatever.

01:24:56.180 --> 01:25:02.180
Good luck, RIAA. You suck. You're never going to fucking stop us from pirating your music.

01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:05.180
I laugh at you wasting billions of dollars trying to try.

01:25:05.180 --> 01:25:08.180
Go ahead! We'll just go out and find a way around that.

01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:11.180
You go, boy.

01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:12.180
Zero.

01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:13.180
It's not very hard.

01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:14.180
No, um, another one.

01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:16.180
I gotta give an F key to my fucking computer.

01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:18.180
No, fuck you to cable, having a cable modem.

01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:21.180
I have to burn a fucking CD every goddamn day.

01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:26.180
Because, like, first of all, my fucking computer is a piece of shit and has a small hard drive.

01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:28.180
I fill it up with music, like, every day.

01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:31.180
I don't have the money for a new fucking hard drive.

01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:33.180
I don't have the money for that yet until I get a job.

01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:35.180
Wait, I have a job. I start tomorrow. All right.

01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:38.860
like I have to burn a CD I'm already out of fucking CDs because fucking music is

01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:43.980
I was sitting there and a stupid credit card bitch came and ran into me and knocked me into the

01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:47.340
bowl on the corner when I was walking up to get a calling card and she said

01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:51.340
that I was a bitch and she said she was going to cut me because I called her a credit card

Jim, did somebody have FUs for somebody else?

01:27:57.740 --> 01:27:59.740
Okay, Zero, give the FUs for somebody else.

01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:01.740
Okay, this is kind of like a battle FU between them.

01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:04.740
But, like, Darkchild, first off, he says,

01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:08.740
Fuck you to loud-ass bass at three o'clock in the morning as he's trying to sleep.

01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:12.740
I guess apparently Bombay was playing his music a little bit too loud at three o'clock in the morning.

01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:13.740
Kiss, kiss.

01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:17.740
Yes, well, yeah, that's right, we need to get him some boxes, huh?

01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:22.740
No, seriously, I'll come over and help this week and pack his stuff up for you.

01:28:23.740 --> 01:28:24.740
Can we put it on the driveway?

01:28:24.740 --> 01:28:26.740
Switchcone's a great place.

01:28:26.740 --> 01:28:28.740
Wait, we can do the whole strong, bad thing.

01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:34.740
Maybe we should put your stereo on the street and find more stuff you'd like to give to me.

01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:35.740
I mean, the people.

01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:37.740
I'll put it in the driveway back over it.

01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:39.740
Except I don't want all that stuff to get in my wheels.

01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:40.740
And views!

01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:42.740
Okay, but anyways, yeah. Back to that, yeah.

01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:43.740
He got pretty pissed off.

01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:44.740
I was talking about taking someone's life up.

01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:49.740
And he said that if he wasn't so tired, he would have got up and beat some ass.

01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:51.740
I wish he was awake.

01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:59.740
And then he says, fuck you to 80s... Hold on! Damn, fucking 80s, all of a sudden everyone fucks around and gets pissed off.

01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:01.740
What?!

01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:04.740
Fuck everyone. No, he says fuck you to 80s...

01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:06.740
What you talking about, Zero?

01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:09.740
Oh my God. Fuck you! I heard that shit.

01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:17.740
No, um, he said, um, fuck you to 80s techno beats and shit because they're all repetitive and looping and he says they suck ass.

01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:27.740
And then, and then the one from DDRchaholic, she decides to say fuck you to Darkchild because she thinks 80s techno is good.

01:29:27.740 --> 01:29:29.740
Anita's a goddess, what can I say?

01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:35.740
Yeah, but I kinda wish that, um, Darkchild was awake in the middle of the night, because that would've been funny to hear.

01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:40.740
At 3.30 in the morning, he gets up and runs out to, like, kill somebody for techno. That'd be cool.

01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:44.740
Rawr. Yeah, I'm done.

01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:45.740
I just have one.

01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:52.740
Speaking of the 80s, and that sort of reminding me of the conversation from earlier.

01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:54.740
Fuck you to Captain N, the Game Master.

01:29:54.740 --> 01:29:56.740
Holy shit, I downloaded a bunch of episodes.

01:29:56.740 --> 01:29:58.740
That show sucks ass.

01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:00.740
That show was the worst ever, because...

01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:03.740
And skewed so many of my viewpoints in video game history.

01:30:03.740 --> 01:30:07.740
Simon was a lot more, like, ballsier than it made him to be.

01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:09.740
Mega high!

01:30:09.740 --> 01:30:12.740
But yeah, fuck that show, I just had a memory of that show.

01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:15.740
Anyway, I'm gonna fuck all of them.

01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:17.740
Ah!

01:30:17.740 --> 01:30:18.740
I'll keep that one.

01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:20.740
Hi.

01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:21.740
This is Jim.

01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:22.740
Yes.

01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:27.740
Uh, you can call me Geist if you want, it's, uh, my handle, I kind of pick up myself.

01:30:27.740 --> 01:30:34.540
But I don't know. I'm kind of vague on my FUs, really. Can't think of many particular

01:30:34.540 --> 01:30:43.580
things. But, shit. I don't know. FU, really, to, hey, you mentioned reality shows and shit

01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:49.180
like that. And so, a fair amount of the people who actually watch that shit, who, you know,

01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:54.900
seems to have no real purpose in their lives to spend hours on end in the days to watch

01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:55.900
this shit all the time.

01:30:55.900 --> 01:31:00.540
talking about asshole

01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:03.320
i don't know if we can stand as a reality

01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:06.640
this because it's not exactly reality

01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:07.980
i mean i don't agree

01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:09.360
the reality movie

01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:10.760
that's too much

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:12.240
exactly

01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:13.400
don't even go there

01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:14.180
fucking

01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:16.580
that's the dumbest fucking thing i've ever seen

01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:18.080
god damn real world

01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:19.080
die!

01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:26.300
Dude, it went up into the yellow. That was cool. And your face is purple.

01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:28.300
My ears are bleeding and your face is purple, Jim?

01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:43.140
Oh, yeah. God, I've got a scatterbrain right now. I can't think of many FUs. This is my

01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:47.900
Dark Side talking. You know, fuck you to the entire human race because, you know, you are

01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:54.380
The plague that is eating this planet alive, like, hell, exactly, getting on a little Matrix

01:31:54.380 --> 01:32:05.380
show, exactly what Agent Smith said, we are a virus, we are a parasite to this planet.

01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:09.460
I mean, we're pretty much just going to do that shit to every other planet we meet up

01:32:09.460 --> 01:32:17.580
in along the way, but, eh, yeah, that's it.

01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:19.580
Alright, chat room FUs.

01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:21.580
Fuck the chat room FUs.

01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:28.580
DDR Angel, my first FU goes to those stupid people, companies, whatever, that send you those damn text messages to your phone wanting you to buy their shit.

01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:34.580
I don't care, I don't need your crap, and stop wasting my monthly 200 text messages there for my friends and not you. Grr.

01:32:34.580 --> 01:32:38.580
FU to my work schedule because I'm going to miss a lot of Orange Onch Radio this week. FU to that.

01:32:38.580 --> 01:32:41.580
You know what, you can just get free text messaging like I have.

01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:44.580
I would also recommend suing the companies that are sending that shit to you.

01:32:44.580 --> 01:32:46.580
You can!

01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:55.580
John Fields says, F you to people calling me a cult leader and trying to sue me for killing someone when that person is still alive and they know that person is alive.

01:32:55.580 --> 01:32:58.580
Huh? That was scary.

01:32:58.580 --> 01:33:05.580
F you to that person who caused it by faking their own death to get off the net.

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:07.580
Wow.

01:33:07.580 --> 01:33:13.580
One more, F you to not being able to DDR more than one game because of not having enough energy even after a full night of sleep.

01:33:13.580 --> 01:33:17.180
whole night of sleep. Wait, let me go back to this. Somebody faked their own death on

01:33:17.180 --> 01:33:21.420
the internet, and then this guy, our guy in the chatroom, John Peels, gets blamed as being

01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:24.780
a cult leader and gets sued for killing that person.

01:33:24.780 --> 01:33:25.860
Okay, first of all...

01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:27.500
How in the hell did that happen?

01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:31.260
First of all, the whole faking your whole death thing on the internet, if anyone falls

01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:38.060
for that bullshit, they're so stupid. You know? I've had people try to pull that stuff

01:33:38.060 --> 01:33:42.060
and then I just, you know, traced their IP and found other places that they're posting.

01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:47.060
That is so weird. Wow.

01:33:47.060 --> 01:33:48.060
That's so stupid.

01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:52.060
As the internet turns, as the world wide web turns.

01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:57.060
Alright, violenthypergirl would like to give a big F.U. to AP Practice Exams and Bitchy Club Advisors.

01:33:57.060 --> 01:34:04.060
Another F.U. to the Milpitas Golf Land AZN Idiots, who think they're good and then run away from the machine when I start freestyling.

01:34:06.060 --> 01:34:07.060
Yeah.

01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:10.380
Muhymer would like to say, fuck stupid friends again.

01:34:10.380 --> 01:34:15.020
Fuck almost going to Ocean City to play DDR, but then my parents are being like, uh, no,

01:34:15.020 --> 01:34:16.020
but I'm going Tuesday anyway.

01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:17.020
You know what's funny?

01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:18.020
Ocean City is that town.

01:34:18.020 --> 01:34:21.060
You ever drive through Sacramento and it's like where Highway 50 starts and they have

01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:25.100
like, oh, Sacramento's this far away and Lake Tahoe's this far away and Ocean City, Maryland

01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:27.780
is this far away because that's where Highway 50 ends.

01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:28.780
Isn't that funny?

01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:29.780
I don't know.

01:34:29.780 --> 01:34:31.780
I thought it was funny, I don't know.

01:34:31.780 --> 01:34:32.780
Well, Rob.

01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:36.820
Fuck online games for being so addicting, although I must say sissyfight.com is strangely

01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:40.000
fun

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.940
after this is that's like but back in the background

01:34:43.940 --> 01:34:47.640
hey i think that's that's what i would like to give an f you to all the spam i

01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:49.400
think getting lately

01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:52.000
the sculpture

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.200
that's why you

01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:54.520
market

01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:58.520
well at the end acuity chasers heavy steps on the extreme not matching your

01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:05.520
max's u s a

01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:11.520
I would like to say a big F U to boring, eventless spring breaks. Now I'm fat again.

01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:14.520
Oh, poor baby!

01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:18.520
Stop watching reality TV and go play some TDR.

01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:21.520
Fraternity life sucks also, I'd just like you to know.

01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:24.520
When someone hates reality TV, you're watching an awful lot of it.

01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:29.520
I was bored yesterday! It was all that was on! I was waiting for a show I'll talk about later.

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:33.520
Anyway, Japan Man would like to say fuck me for forgetting the show. That is all.

01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:38.540
Yeah, fuck you. Fuck you. No, just kidding. It's cool. It happened. Thank you, man. I almost forgot the show today

01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:43.780
Japan man would also like to say fuck certain people that make fun of me when I fail on bag

01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:45.780
And I'm 50 times better than them

01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:50.680
Fuck memories on now. Can you will neo standard? It's a bitch, but I finally beat it. Whoo and

01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:54.880
What the fuck fuck the test our state makes us take every fucking year die

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Oh, so Jimmy

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:03.000
it's alright. Bryce, R-Y-C 3, that's why I said that.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:07.000
R-Y-C 3 would like to say,

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:09.000
Fuck you dumb fucks and SoCal guys who have no chance on getting with the girls they want to get with, then later crying over it to me because they got rejected.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Fuck you to being single.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:18.000
Amen.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Fuck you to kids, free teens at work, testing my patience in the counter giving prizes for tickets.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Haha!

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:26.000
23rd Magus would like to say,

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Kentucky

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Fu to spending a week in Kentucky

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.580
Fu to the flight to Kentucky

01:36:29.580 --> 01:36:31.800
Fu to turbulence on the flight back to Kentucky

01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:34.640
Fu to having the leech money off mom to buy angel a ring in Kentucky

01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:35.800
Hands Angel a ring

01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:39.780
Fu to getting mom's I.P. ban from DJ Bad while I was in Kentucky

01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:41.740
Fu to missing Orange Line while I was in Kentucky

01:36:41.740 --> 01:36:43.560
Fu to having nothing to do in Kentucky

01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:50.560
but pretty much if you do kentucky

01:36:51.580 --> 01:36:58.580
i want to know if you brought back chicken

01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:01.860
more than jake five forty three

01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:03.300
if you to boring breaks

01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:06.140
false hope sports not being made out of metal

01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:07.860
that's a good one

01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:09.840
people who think punk is fashion

01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:11.020
and uh...

01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:14.140
When you send your FUs to the wrong person

01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:17.740
and the fact that I lost my battle royale in my hard drive crash of last week

01:37:17.740 --> 01:37:22.740
Oh yes, FU to american item

01:37:22.740 --> 01:37:25.660
You know what, actually I need to throw in one more fuck you

01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:27.900
Fuck you to 800 megabyte

01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:32.420
binq files that I don't have the disks that are capable of burning

01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:34.340
battle royale to right now

01:37:34.340 --> 01:37:35.780
Zip them up? Does it work?

01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:39.900
No, it's the file to burn to the binq

01:37:39.900 --> 01:37:41.940
And I can't copy the file off.

01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:43.540
That's weird.

01:37:43.540 --> 01:37:47.220
You know they do have things to rip being Q-Files.

01:37:47.220 --> 01:37:54.220
I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about the file itself being too big to burn to a CD.

01:37:54.820 --> 01:37:58.640
Vidpala would like to say, F you to school. I don't want to go back after vacation.

01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:03.640
And F you to myself for bringing all the things needed to play 2DX to the party, except the controller.

01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:06.240
That was funny. Who was that?

01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:08.600
Vidpala.

01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:49.200
F.U. to my stupid computer that likes to reset itself for no apparent reason. It's not even

01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:55.720
an old computer. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the one-hour-long F.U. of the Week. Congratulations.

01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:56.720
Yay!

01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:00.560
You know why your computer resets?

01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:01.560
Why?

01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:06.880
Because probably your fan on your heat sink is dirty and your computer's overheating.

01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:07.880
Check that.

01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:09.880
The computer is hot, what's going on?

01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:39.880
I'll start handing out paper.

01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:54.880
My week was unemployed. I didn't sleep much of the week.

01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:59.880
One. No, I may have done two.

01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:03.880
I'm going to be doing a fuck-off show, though, on Tuesday night, I'm sure.

01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:05.880
Cool. Good job.

01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:07.880
Yeah, that's one reason you've got to listen to that Orange Launch Radio all the time.

01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:09.880
The Urban Monty Museum War Program.

01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:13.880
I got 19 listeners on a fuck-off show.

01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:15.880
Not bad. Not bad.

01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:17.880
That's more than we get on some of these shows.

01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:22.880
Yeah, and I had nine listeners at 7 a.m. one day.

01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:24.880
Which, for internet radio, is amazingly good.

01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:31.880
Because I did a fuck-off show from 11.30pm until 8 in the morning.

01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:34.880
So are we ever going to be featured on a satellite radio?

01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:38.880
I still say we need to get on G4. With some of the crap they have on there, Orange Lounge will fit right in.

01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:40.880
Alright, cool.

01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:46.880
Let's go to this week's Cage Max, shall we, ladies? I just called it Cage Max.

01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:48.880
Max Max Max Max Max!

01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:50.880
Help me.

01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:53.880
Okay, here we go with tonight's Cage Max.

01:40:53.880 --> 01:41:04.880
Last week in the cage match, Loki won it with a song called Duck Toy by Hampenburg.

01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:07.880
And here is a clip of the way the cage match works.

01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:11.880
You can vote for either Loki's song, Dark Sakura's song, or my song.

01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:16.880
And the winning song gets to go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:20.880
Except Duck Toy never went into rotation because they never got a copy of the MP3.

01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:29.880
Oh well. So, here it is, though, one more time for you. It could still win tonight if you want to vote for it. The first entry in tonight's cage match. Here's a clip of Hampenburg with Ducktoy.

01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:49.200
Alright, that was Hamptonburg with Ducktoy, that was last week's winner in Orange Lounge

01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:50.200
Radio's Cage Match.

01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:56.520
for that that's the first song or you can vote for my pick this week uh i promised irene like four

01:42:56.520 --> 01:43:02.040
weeks ago i'd do this song and uh i didn't because i kept finding better stuff like freeze pop

01:43:04.040 --> 01:43:11.080
but i i you know what i'll put in superspro tonight i will don't push me all right

01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:16.040
no i want to do a different i want to do a different artist you should at least be happy

01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:17.040
You won that one.

01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:21.040
There's only because we got to go fight on air, but that was cool.

01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:50.000
They do still do stuff recently because I think this song was on the next best thing soundtrack

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:53.600
That's where it came from. This song is called. It's a cover of an old 70 song and

01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:58.600
And it's called I'm Not In Love. So enjoy. This song is cool.

01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:37.600
I'm not in love, so don't forget it It's just a silly phase I'm going through

01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:50.600
I'm just a cop, I'll call you up Don't get me wrong, I think you got it next

01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:55.600
I'm not in love, no, no

01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:09.600
I'd like to see you back there

01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:15.600
It doesn't mean it means much to me

01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:29.600
So if I call you, I think I'll make it first Don't tell your friends about the two of us

01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:34.600
I'm not in love, not in love

01:45:34.600 --> 01:46:03.600
I keep a picture of the one who had the best day

01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:06.600
I have to say, I'm not in it

01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:11.600
So don't trust me

01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:14.600
You can give it back

01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:17.600
I know the road doesn't mean

01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:20.600
That much to me

01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:44.120
Ooh, you wait a long time for me Ooh, you wait a long time

01:46:44.120 --> 01:47:00.120
Ooh, you wait a long time for me Ooh, you wait a long time

01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:07.120
I'm out of love, so don't forget it

01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:13.120
It's just a thing, don't you worry

01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:20.120
I'm just a card, I call you up

01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:26.120
Don't get me wrong, think about it, babe

01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:28.120
I'm not in love

01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:33.120
If I'm not alive

01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:27.800
Whoopies, oopies.

01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:31.200
I ended that one a little soon. That's alright. That was the end. Those last ten seconds of it.

01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:32.760
That was, uh...

01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:35.640
Olive with I'm...

01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:38.040
That was Olive with I'm not in love.

01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:45.040
What did you kids think of that one?

01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:50.800
Give it a ten on principle.

01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:54.720
I was able to block out most of the song.

01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:59.420
it looks like

01:48:59.420 --> 01:49:04.220
anyone

01:49:04.220 --> 01:49:07.180
what was the title of that song i'm not in love

01:49:07.180 --> 01:49:09.980
i'm not in love with that song

01:49:09.980 --> 01:49:11.420
you're so punny

01:49:11.420 --> 01:49:13.920
no i'm really not that was the worst song ever

01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:16.900
that was almost as bad as freeze pop

01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:18.700
i give it to you

01:49:18.700 --> 01:49:20.060
sucks you bitch

01:49:20.060 --> 01:49:24.260
it sucks you're never gonna like a song i put in cage match you could die yeah but i won

01:49:24.260 --> 01:49:30.180
one for you, didn't I? Whatever. Okay, fine. You didn't win that week either. You lost,

01:49:30.180 --> 01:49:37.180
if it wasn't for me and Kyle fighting. You suck. Tim, what did you think? One to ten

01:49:37.780 --> 01:49:44.780
scale. I don't like it that much. Okay. Well, what do you give it on a one to a ten? Will

01:49:44.780 --> 01:50:03.780
It's a decent song, actually. Some might actually pick, but I'd have to say I'd give it probably

01:50:03.780 --> 01:50:10.780
I give it a 9.9 because it's sexy but not as sexy as me.

01:50:10.780 --> 01:50:17.780
I know who I am. Sorry, I should have said not as sexy as Dr. J.

01:50:17.780 --> 01:50:20.780
Alright, one more pick.

01:50:20.780 --> 01:50:27.780
I'm going to give it a 9.9 because it's sexy but not as sexy as me.

01:50:27.780 --> 01:50:29.780
Okay, as I could have thought.

01:50:37.780 --> 01:50:40.780
This was a song that I... I don't... I was like,

01:50:40.780 --> 01:50:42.780
Oh my God, I need a song! I'll pick this one!

01:50:43.780 --> 01:50:44.780
But I really like it.

01:50:45.780 --> 01:50:46.780
What's it called?

01:50:46.780 --> 01:50:49.780
Phantom of the Opera something or other remix. I don't know.

01:50:49.780 --> 01:50:53.780
Alright, this is the Phantom of the Opera, something or other remix. Enjoy.

01:51:49.780 --> 01:51:53.780
And speaks my name

01:51:53.780 --> 01:51:57.780
And do I dream again?

01:51:57.780 --> 01:52:01.780
For now I find

01:52:01.780 --> 01:52:07.780
The future but the open heart is there

01:52:37.780 --> 01:52:51.780
Those who have seen your face draw back to me

01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:58.780
I am the mask you wear as you lay here

01:52:58.780 --> 01:53:06.780
Your spirit and my wife in one collide

01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:13.780
The future will be over, understand

01:53:13.780 --> 01:53:15.780
And each time you run away

01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:21.780
The future will be over

01:54:51.780 --> 01:55:13.180
Hi, we're back. That was the Phantom of the Opera techno remix. Going around the room,

01:55:13.180 --> 01:55:14.180
what'd you think, Jamie?

01:55:14.180 --> 01:55:20.580
Well, I could have found better if I had tried, so I'd give it an eight and a half.

01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:27.580
Okay, I absolutely love the Phantom of the Opera, but I really like the original a lot more than that.

01:55:27.580 --> 01:55:35.580
And so, even though it's a good remix, uh, techno-mix of it, I'll give it like an 8, because it's still pretty decent, even though it could have been better.

01:55:35.580 --> 01:55:37.580
You know.

01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:42.580
Well, I'm going to give it this rating mostly because my other friend back in Fremont, and

01:55:42.580 --> 01:55:49.580
I can't find him right now, he loves Phantom of the Opera, and I'd say he'd probably give

01:55:49.580 --> 01:55:56.580
it a 10 if he heard it, or a 9 at the least. But just for me, I'll probably give it like

01:55:56.580 --> 01:55:57.580
a 7.

01:55:57.580 --> 01:55:59.580
Lowkey, what'd you think?

01:55:59.580 --> 01:56:01.580
Logie, what did you think?

01:56:01.580 --> 01:56:09.580
Uh, I heard this a long ass time ago, way before I started doing this show. That's how old it is.

01:56:09.580 --> 01:56:11.580
Ooh, food!

01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:12.580
You went to McDonald's instead?

01:56:12.580 --> 01:56:14.580
Keep going, keep going, keep going.

01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:19.580
Oh, I don't give a shit. If you got me the two cheeseburger meals supersized, I love you.

01:56:19.580 --> 01:56:24.580
Order powder? Oh, still love you.

01:56:24.580 --> 01:56:26.580
Okay, cage match, cage match.

01:56:26.580 --> 01:56:45.580
Yeah, sorry. Anyways, the fact is, the song sounds like it came from a bargain CD that I'd find at Tower for five bucks. It was really cheesily done. It's got a good beat to it. I'll tell you what, vote for that song and not mine, because I have a better one next week anyways.

01:56:45.580 --> 01:56:50.580
I give it an 8 but vote for Michael.

01:57:15.580 --> 01:57:22.580
And don't vote for that one. Vote for someone else's. Vote for Rob's. You can vote for Olive with I'm Not in Love.

01:57:22.580 --> 01:57:34.580
Phantom of the Opera – Techno Mix

01:57:52.580 --> 01:57:57.580
There we go.

01:57:57.580 --> 01:58:01.580
Much better clip. There you go. All right, so send in your votes now.

01:58:01.580 --> 01:58:03.580
Be sure to let Rob win.

01:58:03.580 --> 01:58:07.580
Or Jamie. Her pick is pretty good.

01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:09.580
You've won, like, what? Won?

01:58:09.580 --> 01:58:11.580
Yeah. You can vote for me even as a pity pick.

01:58:11.580 --> 01:58:12.580
You deserve to win one.

01:58:12.580 --> 01:58:14.580
All votes productively go to Rob.

01:58:14.580 --> 01:58:16.580
I don't want that song to win.

01:58:16.580 --> 01:58:19.580
All right. Usually we don't go to a musical break right after cage match,

01:58:19.580 --> 01:58:22.260
cage match where there's a little chaotic because we just had food brought into the

01:58:22.260 --> 01:58:26.540
room so people are scrounging for food. So we're going to take a quick quickie break

01:58:26.540 --> 01:58:30.620
and we will be right back. And we're going to have tonight's list list when we get back.

01:58:30.620 --> 01:58:38.120
So we're going to go to a song that I think Jamie likes a lot this week because you had

01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:42.780
a good accomplishment with this song this week. Okay, we're going to hear the long version

01:58:42.780 --> 01:58:49.780
the last message and we'll be right back.

01:59:12.780 --> 01:59:14.780
How I'm feeling

01:59:14.780 --> 01:59:17.780
My hustle's around with no place

01:59:17.780 --> 01:59:20.780
Hang on the ceiling, stop me

01:59:20.780 --> 01:59:23.780
Hang on the shuttles, no more dealing

01:59:23.780 --> 01:59:27.780
It's time to say goodbye, goodbye, baby

01:59:27.780 --> 01:59:29.780
I want you to know

01:59:29.780 --> 01:59:32.780
I'm ready to be happy

01:59:32.780 --> 01:59:35.780
It's more time for me to say

01:59:35.780 --> 01:59:38.780
Baby, that's it for you

01:59:38.780 --> 01:59:40.780
You don't have to love me again

01:59:40.780 --> 01:59:42.780
It's only too bad

01:59:42.780 --> 01:59:44.780
That's it for you

01:59:44.780 --> 01:59:46.780
I can take you over

01:59:46.780 --> 01:59:48.780
I don't need you anymore

01:59:54.780 --> 01:59:57.780
That's right, that's right for you

01:59:57.780 --> 02:00:04.780
I'm feeling, you should've seen that me inside

02:00:04.780 --> 02:00:11.780
I don't need an eye, but you must believe that I

02:00:11.780 --> 02:00:18.780
I'm living in your reality, I'm the loser

02:00:48.780 --> 02:00:53.780
Who are you? So I can make you go where I don't want to go anymore

02:01:18.780 --> 02:01:27.780
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry for you

02:01:27.780 --> 02:01:35.780
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry for you

02:02:05.780 --> 02:02:11.780
With respect to the moon, I'm thinking of you, love

02:02:11.780 --> 02:02:16.780
Half a mile away, no matter where you may be

02:02:16.780 --> 02:02:20.780
My thoughts will travel to you

02:02:20.780 --> 02:02:26.780
Cause I think my message will come back on the moon

02:02:26.780 --> 02:02:30.780
Please give my stories to my love

02:02:30.780 --> 02:02:33.180
Mr. Luke, I love him so

02:02:33.180 --> 02:02:36.980
He's showing a change just to find out

02:02:36.980 --> 02:02:40.180
Mr. Luke, I love him so

02:02:40.180 --> 02:02:43.380
Now that we're through, baby

02:02:43.380 --> 02:02:45.780
I've got the moonlight skies

02:02:45.780 --> 02:02:51.980
Welcome to you

02:02:51.980 --> 02:02:58.580
Welcome with you

02:02:58.580 --> 02:03:05.580
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

02:03:20.580 --> 02:03:25.580
Extreme Bimani Radio. That's us. Orange Lounge Radio.

02:03:25.580 --> 02:03:31.340
We are back ladies and gentlemen, and I have tonight's winner of the cage match

02:03:32.660 --> 02:03:34.380
and

02:03:34.380 --> 02:03:36.060
by an amazing

02:03:36.060 --> 02:03:38.060
one vote

02:03:38.060 --> 02:03:43.380
One vote margin made this song win tonight's cage match winner is

02:03:47.540 --> 02:03:49.460
That's the way

02:03:49.460 --> 02:03:54.180
By why I tell you not to you do you bastard. That's it

02:03:54.180 --> 02:03:56.180
You're on the list!

02:03:56.180 --> 02:04:00.180
By one vote over Phantom of the Opera. One vote.

02:04:00.180 --> 02:04:01.180
Doesn't that mean Rob wins?

02:04:01.180 --> 02:04:04.180
If the one person who voted for Olive would have voted the other way around.

02:04:04.180 --> 02:04:06.180
I know! Only one person!

02:04:06.180 --> 02:04:08.180
Only one person voted for Olive.

02:04:08.180 --> 02:04:12.180
You're not speaking to English! I said don't vote for the damn song!

02:04:12.180 --> 02:04:14.180
Because that's something better next week.

02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:18.180
Which is funny because I could swear that the one person who voted for my song

02:04:18.180 --> 02:04:21.180
was also the one person who was hating on it in the chat room.

02:04:21.180 --> 02:04:23.180
Rob wins.

02:04:25.180 --> 02:04:28.180
So, Loki, congratulations, you win once again.

02:04:28.180 --> 02:04:33.180
However, I guess since Jamie did this a few weeks back, we will extend the same offer to you.

02:04:33.180 --> 02:04:38.180
You can pull the song Voluntary out next week and put in your own new song.

02:04:38.180 --> 02:04:40.180
Because we let Jamie do that with the Zelda thing, right?

02:04:40.180 --> 02:04:42.180
So, only to be fair.

02:04:42.180 --> 02:04:45.180
Now, I have, um, this is my new project thing I want to...

02:04:45.180 --> 02:04:48.180
I say, us as Americans should push this.

02:04:48.180 --> 02:04:55.540
this. Get rid of reality TV and instead put Japanese game shows. Why? Why? The greatest

02:04:55.540 --> 02:05:01.080
thing has happened yesterday, okay? TNN has brought this new show. Well, it's kind of

02:05:01.080 --> 02:05:06.060
an old Japanese TV show where they basically torture these people. Anyways, and they make

02:05:06.060 --> 02:05:10.760
them do ridiculous challenges. And the show is called Most Extreme Elimination Challenge.

02:05:10.760 --> 02:05:15.680
It's the greatest show ever and because it's all in Japanese, they have these people dubbing

02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:21.100
over the voices and making them sound really goofy and stupid. And it's that much better.

02:05:21.100 --> 02:05:26.620
Is the greatest show on earth. I... It would beat out any reality show. Fuck that. This

02:05:26.620 --> 02:05:32.980
is the best shit ever, okay? This is the best fucking... This is what game shows should

02:05:32.980 --> 02:05:39.660
aspire to be, okay? I mean, Price is Right is good, but nowhere... It does not come anywhere

02:05:39.660 --> 02:05:46.060
near this damn show. Best show ever. Speaking of reality shows, did you, uh, see any previews

02:05:46.060 --> 02:05:53.060
lately for that new Spring Break reality movie that's coming out? I already fucking talked

02:05:53.060 --> 02:05:58.420
about that. Okay, that fucking black guy in his fucking speedo, he can die. Yeah, this

02:05:58.420 --> 02:06:04.100
is a great idea. Let's take non-actors, give them no script, and just have them go wild

02:06:04.100 --> 02:06:08.780
on Spring Break, and we'll film it and call it a movie. Fuck that. I can go around yelling

02:06:08.780 --> 02:06:13.780
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Speaking of reality TV, I watched something that Islander had.

02:06:13.780 --> 02:06:18.780
The Blind Date DVD. The Uncensored Blind Date DVD.

02:06:18.780 --> 02:06:21.780
A really blind date. I've already seen that really blind date.

02:06:21.780 --> 02:06:28.780
Well, this one was great. I mean, besides, though, all the boobs and cock there was all over the place.

02:06:28.780 --> 02:06:35.780
They showed this one person who, like, by the end of the day, they were, like, already all over each other the whole date. It was funny.

02:06:35.780 --> 02:06:41.780
They just met the first time. Yeah, she unbuttoned her sweater.

02:06:41.780 --> 02:06:43.780
It was just like...

02:06:43.780 --> 02:06:47.780
I was like, these are your first dates. What's wrong with these stupid people?

02:06:47.780 --> 02:06:51.780
By the way, boys and girls, Orange Lounge the motion picture comes out at the end of the year.

02:06:51.780 --> 02:06:53.780
No, it doesn't.

02:06:53.780 --> 02:06:55.780
And that's all it is, is a moving picture.

02:06:55.780 --> 02:06:57.780
Yeah, it comes out and then it goes back in.

02:06:57.780 --> 02:07:00.780
Stupid MTV with their stupid reality shows.

02:07:00.780 --> 02:07:02.780
Fraternity Life is...

02:07:02.780 --> 02:07:12.780
Okay, fraternity life and sorority life are being filmed at the same time, you know, one falls obviously, the sorority, and the other one the fraternity, and their rival, you know, fraternity-sorority things.

02:07:12.780 --> 02:07:16.780
Biggest bunch of repressed homosexuals I've ever seen on television.

02:07:16.780 --> 02:07:21.780
Yeah, okay, so that show's really stupid. Fucking girls, like, totally schooled these guys.

02:07:21.780 --> 02:07:23.780
sorority life

02:07:51.780 --> 02:07:58.280
They're gonna have these girls sign this t-shirt for no reason whatsoever, and like, write that, like, you know, this fraternity sucks or some shit.

02:07:58.280 --> 02:08:01.780
And I mean, come on, if you're, if this, like, you know, fraternity comes up to you,

02:08:01.780 --> 02:08:05.780
Can you sign my shirt? You gotta be a little suspicious to what's going on there.

02:08:05.780 --> 02:08:14.780
Especially, it's like, so then they end up stealing the shirt, and then making them come over and clean their house, and then fuck up their house too, and I laugh at them, because they suck.

02:08:14.780 --> 02:08:23.900
What do they do? I ask for a big and tasty with no meat. I got a piece of bread, some

02:08:23.900 --> 02:08:31.540
onions and a tomato. Beautiful. You know why? You need to go to BK because they have the

02:08:31.540 --> 02:08:36.500
veggie burger there, which is pretty decent. We need to do listless. Yes, we do need to

02:08:36.500 --> 02:08:39.820
do listless. There was one other thing I was thinking of that I wanted to bring up before...

02:08:39.820 --> 02:08:44.220
But you forgot, so let's do listless. Alright, but I forgot, so let's do listless. Yay, a

02:08:44.220 --> 02:08:51.220
We don't have official theme music for Whistlers, I just realized. We don't really have any theme music. Do we want some theme music for Whistlers?

02:08:51.220 --> 02:08:53.220
Um...yeah, man.

02:08:53.220 --> 02:08:55.220
Sure.

02:08:55.220 --> 02:08:58.220
Uh...let's see.

02:08:58.220 --> 02:09:02.220
Uh...okay.

02:09:02.220 --> 02:09:04.220
Alright guys, it's time for...

02:09:04.220 --> 02:09:11.220
It is time, once again, for Orange Lounge Radio's Listless!

02:09:28.180 --> 02:09:32.100
It's inspired by an old television show that used to be on VH1.

02:09:32.100 --> 02:09:34.100
Stolen from, but inspired by.

02:09:35.100 --> 02:09:37.100
Alright, tonight's topic...

02:09:40.100 --> 02:09:42.100
Jamie is here to explain tonight's topic.

02:09:42.100 --> 02:09:43.100
I am? Oh.

02:09:43.100 --> 02:09:44.100
Yes.

02:09:44.100 --> 02:09:46.100
Tonight's topic is Chicken McNugget.

02:09:47.100 --> 02:09:48.100
No.

02:09:49.100 --> 02:09:52.100
This, again, is back on the Kingdom Hearts theme.

02:09:52.100 --> 02:09:59.100
It is what world that is associated with Disney, Miramax, Anix, or Square?

02:09:59.100 --> 02:10:00.100
ABC.

02:10:00.100 --> 02:10:03.100
Anix.

02:10:03.100 --> 02:10:05.100
Aenis.

02:10:05.100 --> 02:10:06.100
Squeenix.

02:10:06.100 --> 02:10:09.100
Squeenix, yep, Squeenix.

02:10:09.100 --> 02:10:13.100
Or for Loki, Squeenis.

02:10:13.100 --> 02:10:16.100
Would you like to see in the next Kingdom Hearts game?

02:10:16.100 --> 02:10:37.100
What world would you like to see in the new Kingdom Hearts game?

02:10:37.100 --> 02:10:41.100
Alright, here we go. Who's participating? Show of hands.

02:10:41.100 --> 02:10:45.320
This this whole thing you guys are at McDonald's sorry, okay, Jamie's first. Yes, Jamie

02:10:54.720 --> 02:11:01.160
All right, so Jamie says corner trigger chrono trust a particular reason any you want to say anything reasons why

02:11:01.160 --> 02:11:07.160
First of all, I think Michelle would kill me, because there needs to be a Dark Surge as a bad guy.

02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:15.160
And that, and I want, um, I want, um, Magus, and I want to play the game and have Magus be in my party.

02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:16.160
Okay.

02:11:16.160 --> 02:11:21.160
Because I couldn't ever bring myself to defeat him in battle, because I wanted him in my party.

02:11:21.160 --> 02:11:25.160
And I wanted to kick everybody's ass with that Dark Zone spell he has.

02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:26.160
Alright.

02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:27.160
Yeah.

02:11:27.160 --> 02:11:28.160
Okay.

02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:30.160
And it was the hair, you know, the hair.

02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:35.160
Fair enough, good reasons. Zero, what world would you most like to see in the next Kingdom Hearts?

02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:37.160
It would be funny to see Chasing Daisy.

02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:39.160
Chasing Daisy?

02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:46.160
I know, but if you wanted to mix it, it would be Chasing Amy, but you'd just call it Chasing Daisy.

02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:50.160
Any particular reason why we want this Chasing Amy slash Chasing Daisy thing?

02:11:50.160 --> 02:11:54.160
It would be funny to see Mickey, Donald, and Goofy going after a lesbian.

02:11:54.160 --> 02:11:56.160
You just want Daisy Duck to be a dyke.

02:11:56.160 --> 02:11:58.160
Cause she'll want Biddy.

02:11:58.160 --> 02:12:04.000
Dude, this burger's rare. What's a Nubian? Look at this. The burger is pink. Shut the

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:11.000
fuck up. The burger's raw. I'm gonna eat it and get poisoned. Is Jim? What was your online

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:15.040
name again? I'm sorry. Uh, Guice. That's not my online name. It's just kind of a handle

02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:22.040
of mine. Guys. Okay, Guice. Um, uh, kind of serious. Uh, in the style of Final Fighting

02:12:22.040 --> 02:12:26.040
Final Fighting Fantasy, actually.

02:12:26.040 --> 02:12:27.040
Any Final Fantasy?

02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:30.040
No, Final Fighting Fantasy, in Flash.

02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:35.040
Ah, okay.

02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:37.040
Final Fighting Fantasy.

02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:41.040
For those of you who don't know what Final Fighting Fantasy is,

02:12:41.040 --> 02:12:44.040
it's basically just a combination of all the Final Fantasy worlds

02:12:44.040 --> 02:12:47.040
with basically all the storylines intact.

02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:50.040
Like, whatever characters died in the games are still dead

02:12:50.040 --> 02:12:52.040
and various other things like that.

02:12:52.040 --> 02:12:59.040
First of all, they already have seven and eight and ten involved in Kingdom Hearts already.

02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:01.040
Well, you can combine the others.

02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:06.040
No, but we're actually picking established individual worlds.

02:13:06.040 --> 02:13:11.040
Well, basically involving one, two, three, four, five, and six as well.

02:13:11.040 --> 02:13:17.040
Well, that's the thing with this thing. It's like a saga created to combine all those worlds into one.

02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:19.040
Does it exist as a real square?

02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:20.040
Huh?

02:13:20.040 --> 02:13:21.040
I mean...

02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:25.040
Well, it's based off of square characters, though, so...

02:13:25.040 --> 02:13:27.040
All right.

02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:30.040
Final Fighting Fantasy.

02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:31.040
All right.

02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:33.040
Final Fighting Fantasy is the bomb, yo!

02:13:33.040 --> 02:13:36.040
All right, for those who may not have heard of it, there's your explanation.

02:13:36.040 --> 02:13:37.040
Let's go on.

02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:39.040
Logie, your number three pick.

02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:44.040
I'm gonna rain on someone's parade here, but Xenogears or Xenosaga...

02:13:44.040 --> 02:13:47.040
Xeno... Xenogears or Xenosaga? You gotta pick one.

02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:50.040
Xenogears is fucking... Well, Xenogears is only...

02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:52.040
It's the same fucking universe.

02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:53.040
Alright.

02:13:56.040 --> 02:13:58.040
Uh, any other particular reason why?

02:14:00.040 --> 02:14:06.040
Because that game rocks. It has giant robots to smash down Mickey because he sucks and he's gay.

02:14:06.040 --> 02:14:09.040
Alright, Irene. Your pick.

02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:15.040
Well, I'm incorporating both Anita and Jason's picks, so our number three is Star Ocean.

02:14:15.040 --> 02:14:16.040
Star Ocean.

02:14:16.040 --> 02:14:23.040
Yeah, I've never played it, but they said it, so I don't know.

02:14:23.040 --> 02:14:28.040
Alright, since we can pick anything, you know, Miramax, any of that, because they all are

02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:31.040
owned by the same group, my number three was Pulp Fiction Land.

02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:33.040
That would be funny.

02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:35.040
That would be funny.

02:14:36.040 --> 02:14:39.040
Here's the Keyblade. I had it up my ass.

02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:45.040
Give me back my Keyblade. Which Keyblade is it? Everyone says bad motherfucker on it.

02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:51.040
Lord will strike down upon thee with great vengeance. Alright.

02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:54.040
They don't call it a Keyblade. Here, you know what they call it?

02:14:55.040 --> 02:14:56.040
Alright.

02:14:56.040 --> 02:14:58.040
The Blade Royale.

02:14:58.040 --> 02:14:59.040
With cheese.

02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:00.040
The Battle Royale.

02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:02.040
The Battle Royale.

02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:04.040
Yes, Jamie, your number two pick?

02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:07.040
My number two pick is Bust-A-Move and Bust-A-Move 2.

02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:11.040
Cause I want heat in my party.

02:15:12.040 --> 02:15:13.040
To dance.

02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:15.040
And set people on fire.

02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:16.040
Alright.

02:15:16.040 --> 02:15:19.040
So you want Bust-A-Move so you can have heat lay down the wall.

02:15:19.040 --> 02:15:22.040
And no I'm not talking about Puzzle Bobble.

02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:26.040
And the name Bust-A-Groove is not really a name.

02:15:26.040 --> 02:15:30.040
It's what the 989 Studios has duped you into thinking it is.

02:15:30.040 --> 02:15:44.040
I think it would be cool to see all the characters from Kingdom Hearts have an air-guys type fighting game.

02:16:00.040 --> 02:16:04.040
Alright, Jim. Your number two pick.

02:16:04.040 --> 02:16:09.040
My number two pick would have to be the best thing to come out of Disney, Gargoyles.

02:16:09.040 --> 02:16:16.040
Gargoyles. Very good. Alright.

02:16:16.040 --> 02:16:23.040
I remember the old Gargoyles quest games on Game... Actually, I don't think they had anything... Did they have anything to do with the series? No, they weren't related, were they?

02:16:23.040 --> 02:16:26.040
Alright, Gargoyles. That's a good one. Alright.

02:16:26.040 --> 02:16:33.200
Loki you're number two pick the best fucking game for Squaresoft. Well, yeah what you the artists formerly known as Squaresoft

02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:36.920
Fergots are not

02:16:37.040 --> 02:16:41.040
No, wrong game wrong game. It gives Anita einhänder

02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:46.960
What one what one einhänder einhänder einhänder

02:16:47.360 --> 02:16:49.360
meaning one hander

02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:51.680
H A N D E R

02:16:52.520 --> 02:16:54.360
It's a shooter

02:16:54.360 --> 02:17:15.080
I don't even think this is related to Square or Disney or Miramax or anything, but I put

02:17:15.080 --> 02:17:16.080
Reading Rainbow!

02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:17.080
Reading Rainbow!

02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:24.000
Reading Rainbow World would be so awesome.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.280
Reading Rainbow is done by LeVar Burton, right?

02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:27.280
Yes, LeVar Burton.

02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:30.760
LeVar Burton is on Star Trek The Next Generation.

02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:33.400
Star Trek The Next Generation was sponsored by...

02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:36.680
Give me a help, Slayer.

02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:39.100
Okay, I'm trying to...

02:17:39.100 --> 02:17:40.880
Would he join your party at that point?

02:17:40.880 --> 02:17:41.880
2 plus 2 is 4.

02:17:41.880 --> 02:17:42.880
4 times 3 is 12.

02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:43.880
There are 12 inches in a ruler.

02:17:43.880 --> 02:17:47.880
Queen Elizabeth was a ruler, and so on and so forth.

02:17:47.880 --> 02:17:49.880
Yeah, anyway, so vote for Reading Rainbow.

02:17:49.880 --> 02:17:52.880
It says it was eel sex.

02:17:52.880 --> 02:17:54.880
Ah!

02:17:54.880 --> 02:17:55.880
Reading Rainbow.

02:17:55.880 --> 02:17:56.880
I used to have the theme song.

02:17:56.880 --> 02:17:57.880
I can't find it anymore.

02:17:57.880 --> 02:17:58.880
Oh, well.

02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:00.880
Butterfly in the sky.

02:18:03.880 --> 02:18:06.880
All right, anyway, my number two pick.

02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:09.880
Now, this is stretching it.

02:18:09.880 --> 02:18:11.880
I'm really stretching it here.

02:18:11.880 --> 02:18:21.880
Okay, so we looped it to Disney. Well, Disney not only owns Miramax, but they also own Touchstone Pictures, which put out a movie, Romeo and Michelle.

02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:28.880
So I said they need to be Romeo and Michelleville, because it would be 80s nostalgia galore.

02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:33.880
Oh, yeah? F you.

02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:36.880
Alright, my number one.

02:18:36.880 --> 02:18:38.880
Yes, your number one, Jamie.

02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:44.880
Because Disney now owns the rights to the dub version of Digimon, so that's my pick.

02:18:44.880 --> 02:18:46.880
Digimon.

02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:47.880
Because Pokemon sucks ass.

02:18:47.880 --> 02:18:50.880
Yeah, I just saw Pokemon 4 this week. It was cool.

02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:52.880
And Pokemon 5's coming out soon.

02:18:52.880 --> 02:18:58.880
Okay, first of all, if you watch Digimon in Japanese, it doesn't suck. I do agree, the dub is sort of ass.

02:19:03.880 --> 02:19:05.880
Zero, your number one pick.

02:19:05.880 --> 02:19:11.380
Okay, I had a tough time choosing between because but since you know Disney owns ABC because you know

02:19:11.380 --> 02:19:13.940
They're trying to be the Microsoft or television now. I

02:19:14.620 --> 02:19:17.820
Had to choose it would either be the Drew Carey show or whose line is it anyway?

02:19:17.820 --> 02:19:22.720
Because that would be hella funny. That would be funny. You have to like improv to make everyone laugh

02:19:22.720 --> 02:19:27.720
Is that your number one pick? Son of a bitch, you took mine.

02:19:27.720 --> 02:19:36.720
I just want to say for those who had their picks taken by somebody else, great minds think alike.

02:19:36.720 --> 02:19:40.720
I'm not getting you in the mic. Make sure it's on over there.

02:19:40.720 --> 02:19:41.720
Hello?

02:19:41.720 --> 02:19:44.720
Oh, there we go. Okay, it's back. Oh, whatever. That was weird.

02:19:44.720 --> 02:19:58.720
My number one pick would have to be, excluding those underdeveloped characters, unless there are some pedophiles in the audience, would have to be a Final Fantasy nudist colony.

02:19:58.720 --> 02:20:02.720
A Final Fantasy nudist colony.

02:20:02.720 --> 02:20:04.720
It's something anybody can like.

02:20:04.720 --> 02:20:09.720
Well, we had to get porn in the show somehow.

02:20:09.720 --> 02:20:11.720
Alright.

02:20:11.720 --> 02:20:13.720
Number one.

02:20:13.720 --> 02:20:21.560
All right number one from Loki, okay, right second, okay, it's gonna be

02:20:25.600 --> 02:20:28.800
Horrible theme park ride turned into movie Ville

02:20:33.800 --> 02:20:40.000
Horrible horrible theme park attraction turned into movie Ville because parts of the Caribbean you're in a mansion

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:41.000
mention

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:42.320
the country bears

02:20:42.320 --> 02:20:44.720
that has nothing to do with the subject of the

02:20:44.720 --> 02:20:46.040
keys match

02:20:46.040 --> 02:20:46.560
that

02:20:46.560 --> 02:20:49.720
parts of the caribbean's being made of

02:20:49.720 --> 02:20:52.280
you gotta pick what's over parts of the caribbean

02:20:52.280 --> 02:20:54.600
fine i'll pick a god damn universe then

02:20:54.600 --> 02:20:55.760
alright you know

02:20:55.760 --> 02:20:57.520
let's see here uh...

02:20:57.520 --> 02:21:00.080
we pull it out of my ass here uh...

02:21:00.080 --> 02:21:02.720
we're gonna pick they're gonna go to bears

02:21:02.720 --> 02:21:03.680
no

02:21:03.680 --> 02:21:05.840
they're gonna go to uh...

02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:09.360
i don't know let's see how about halloweenville because you know

02:21:09.360 --> 02:21:10.640
Halloween...

02:21:10.640 --> 02:21:13.120
Halloweenville's in the game, and Kingdom Hearts 1.

02:21:13.120 --> 02:21:16.240
HOLLOWEITHAFUCKINGMOVIEVILL, GODDAMMIT, YOU KNOW?

02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:21.480
Alright, alright, alright.

02:21:21.480 --> 02:21:23.600
Yeah, it is Miramax.

02:21:23.600 --> 02:21:25.520
Okay, if you would...

02:21:25.520 --> 02:21:26.680
Alright.

02:21:26.680 --> 02:21:31.000
This is Dchild, and since I'm not part of this list list, I'm just throwing one out there,

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.120
because I have to get this out. Alright.

02:21:33.120 --> 02:21:38.040
Because Kevin Smith was a whore for Miramax, I'd have to say the Quick Stop,

02:21:38.040 --> 02:21:41.960
Along with Jay and Simon, Bob, you must have them.

02:21:41.960 --> 02:21:44.420
Yeah, I was going to say, they already have it.

02:21:44.420 --> 02:21:47.640
Everybody else is going to see that, so it's exciting.

02:21:47.640 --> 02:21:48.720
All right, the quick stop.

02:21:48.720 --> 02:21:50.600
All right, Irene, what's your guys' number one?

02:21:50.600 --> 02:21:52.800
OK, this is that Anita's suggestion.

02:21:52.800 --> 02:21:53.920
Is it on?

02:21:53.920 --> 02:21:55.240
Yeah, OK.

02:21:55.240 --> 02:21:58.360
She suggested Spirited Awayville, or town,

02:21:58.360 --> 02:21:59.400
or something.

02:21:59.400 --> 02:22:00.400
It's a ghost.

02:22:00.400 --> 02:22:02.640
Because, yes, because I love Spirited Away.

02:22:02.640 --> 02:22:03.400
That's a good one.

02:22:03.400 --> 02:22:04.680
Spirited Away was a great film.

02:22:04.680 --> 02:22:06.920
So Spirited Away the Land, or whatever.

02:22:06.920 --> 02:22:10.920
My number one was Whose Line Is It Anyway, but it got taken, bastard.

02:22:10.920 --> 02:22:18.920
So I'm gonna change, I'm gonna do a ride as well, because the whole discussion about the ride got me thinking, and I would love to see a spinning teacup slam.

02:22:24.920 --> 02:22:28.920
Where you just spin round and round and you're in a giant teacup.

02:22:29.920 --> 02:22:34.920
Yeah, and then everybody vomits all over and it's just a big green pile of shit.

02:22:34.920 --> 02:22:37.920
You didn't do the faulty gondola ride, Ville.

02:22:38.920 --> 02:22:45.920
Alright, now is the part where we have to say goodbye to something that's on the list. Here we go, Jamie.

02:22:45.920 --> 02:22:50.920
There's a lot of these that I would take off the list because they have absolutely nothing to do with the subject of the list list, however...

02:22:50.920 --> 02:22:53.920
Yeah, you put urgent! Ein, hein, ein. Someone said urgent?

02:22:53.920 --> 02:22:54.920
Yeah, someone said urgent.

02:22:54.920 --> 02:22:56.920
And it's its own universe.

02:22:57.920 --> 02:22:58.920
Alright, alright.

02:22:58.920 --> 02:23:05.920
So, I'm gonna take off Final Fighting Fantasy because that's involving multiple universes, so it's trying to combine multiple things in one, so it's cheating.

02:23:05.920 --> 02:23:08.920
Alright, so Final Fighting Fantasy. Alright, he's off.

02:23:08.920 --> 02:23:15.920
If it isn't Final Fantasy VI or Final Fantasy V, I would have agreed with it. However, that's sort of cheating to take multiple answers in one.

02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:18.920
Alright, so on to technicality. There it goes. Alright, zero.

02:23:18.920 --> 02:23:20.920
She's gonna end up punching someone over him or something.

02:23:20.920 --> 02:23:25.920
No, I would take out probably the Final Fantasy nudist colony, because I don't think it would be...

02:23:25.920 --> 02:23:29.920
You could, like, look on the internet for that! You could look on the internet for that!

02:23:29.920 --> 02:23:31.920
Alright, get on the internet if you want to see some nudie.

02:23:31.920 --> 02:23:34.920
Because we know Cloud's in the gay porn, so, uh, yeah.

02:23:34.920 --> 02:23:38.920
Alright, I don't know if you can see the list all the way back there, Jim, but is there something on here? It's gotta go.

02:23:38.920 --> 02:23:58.920
Oh, I'm sorry. Since I wasn't that big of a fan of it, I'd have to say Romy and Michelleville.

02:23:58.920 --> 02:24:01.920
Aw, make me cry.

02:24:01.920 --> 02:24:05.920
This is the dial tone.

02:24:05.920 --> 02:24:07.920
Wokey.

02:24:07.920 --> 02:24:09.920
Uh...

02:24:09.920 --> 02:24:11.920
We're gonna take off...

02:24:11.920 --> 02:24:13.920
Um...

02:24:13.920 --> 02:24:15.920
Chasing Daisy.

02:24:15.920 --> 02:24:17.920
Chasing Daisy.

02:24:17.920 --> 02:24:19.920
You do have- the quickstop's a little better.

02:24:19.920 --> 02:24:21.920
Yeah, quickstop's a little better.

02:24:21.920 --> 02:24:23.920
Alright. I agree.

02:24:23.920 --> 02:24:25.920
Irene, what's coming down?

02:24:25.920 --> 02:24:27.920
Um...

02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:29.920
I...

02:24:29.920 --> 02:24:31.920
Shit. Um...

02:24:31.920 --> 02:24:38.920
I think I'm going to take off the spinning teacups because it's kind of lame.

02:24:38.920 --> 02:24:39.920
You suck.

02:24:39.920 --> 02:24:40.920
Yeah.

02:24:40.920 --> 02:24:41.920
Haha.

02:24:41.920 --> 02:24:42.920
All my picks are going.

02:24:42.920 --> 02:24:43.920
Okay, so yeah.

02:24:43.920 --> 02:24:44.920
Makes me sad.

02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:49.720
All right, then that leaves me.

02:24:49.720 --> 02:24:56.920
As tempting as I am to take off Chrono Trigger, because everybody knows I think it's overrated,

02:24:56.920 --> 02:25:00.160
but no, I'm going to keep it on there because I'd get killed by so many people if I did

02:25:00.160 --> 02:25:01.160
take that off.

02:25:01.160 --> 02:25:13.160
So... I don't know. I guess I have to take off Halloween, Michael Myers, because they already did the Nightmare Before Christmas land.

02:25:13.160 --> 02:25:18.160
Hellraiser I would have let you keep, but...

02:25:18.160 --> 02:25:25.160
Alright, so now you can vote for one of these lands that should be in the next Kingdom Hearts game.

02:25:25.160 --> 02:25:29.160
So here they are, they're in the chatroom, and Jamie's going to read them off for you.

02:25:29.160 --> 02:25:50.160
We have Chrono Trigger Chrono Cross, we have Xenogear Xenosaga, Star Ocean, Pulp Fiction Land, Bust and Move World, Air Guys, Gargoyles, Einhonder, Reading Rainbow, Digimon, Whose Line is it Anyway?, Quick Stop, and Spirited Away. Vote!

02:25:50.160 --> 02:25:54.160
You can send those votes right now over a private message to me.

02:25:54.160 --> 02:25:55.160
And you can send your complaints...

02:25:55.160 --> 02:25:57.160
Skye.

02:25:57.160 --> 02:26:01.160
In the chat room.

02:26:01.160 --> 02:26:02.160
All right.

02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:04.160
While you guys vote, we're going to take a quick break.

02:26:04.160 --> 02:26:07.160
And we're going to come back and just talk about...

02:26:07.160 --> 02:26:09.160
Are you ready to do a game review this week?

02:26:09.160 --> 02:26:11.160
I actually have a couple ideas.

02:26:11.160 --> 02:26:12.160
All right.

02:26:12.160 --> 02:26:13.160
Zenzero's game review when we come back.

02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:14.160
That'll be fun.

02:26:14.160 --> 02:26:16.160
You've got to get Darkchild in on this one, too.

02:26:16.160 --> 02:26:18.160
He's my cohort here.

02:26:18.160 --> 02:26:25.680
Okay, so, we're gonna listen to some more 2DX fun stuff music, and we'll be right back

02:26:25.680 --> 02:26:30.680
with zero and dark child's game review yay all right we'll be back

02:26:55.680 --> 02:27:00.680
Did we stand together, while it was not a waste of time?

02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:07.680
Let me settle my mind, girl, till you're walking away from me

02:27:09.680 --> 02:27:14.680
I'll just close my eyes and feel the pain that I have inside

02:27:15.680 --> 02:27:21.680
What is this pain? What is this pain? What is this pain inside?

02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:25.680
What is this thing? What is this thing?

02:27:25.680 --> 02:27:29.680
I thought that you were mine

02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:35.680
Well, it's time to say goodbye

02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:41.680
I can't even realize

02:27:41.680 --> 02:27:49.680
And I know you'll be the one in my own life

02:27:49.680 --> 02:27:56.180
I'll never forget the way that you kissed and the way that you smiled

02:27:56.180 --> 02:28:03.680
Forever, where did it come from?

02:28:03.680 --> 02:28:06.680
What is this baby? What is this baby?

02:28:06.680 --> 02:28:09.680
What is this baby?

02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:13.680
I can't find a home

02:29:09.680 --> 02:29:10.680
Oh!

02:29:10.680 --> 02:29:11.680
Oh!

02:29:11.680 --> 02:29:12.680
Oh!

02:29:12.680 --> 02:29:13.680
Oh!

02:30:13.680 --> 02:30:25.680
You must be, you must be, you must be

02:30:25.680 --> 02:30:28.680
You know you need a brother

02:30:28.680 --> 02:30:56.680
Can you make me feel that you're learning what's real?

02:30:56.680 --> 02:31:02.680
So make them feel that you're mine and you're mine

02:31:18.680 --> 02:31:22.680
You're mine and you're mine

02:31:22.680 --> 02:31:29.680
And if you can't consent

02:31:29.680 --> 02:31:36.680
Then you're gonna have to go out

02:31:36.680 --> 02:31:43.680
And if you can't consent

02:31:43.680 --> 02:32:00.360
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

02:32:00.360 --> 02:32:04.320
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

02:32:04.320 --> 02:32:09.600
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

02:32:09.600 --> 02:32:12.920
Well, you're just going to take a left at the Shell Station and then you're going to

02:32:12.920 --> 02:32:17.720
go about a mile anyway you listen you're listening to orange lounge radio and I

02:32:17.720 --> 02:32:25.680
bet you all want to know who won the list less segment so here we go the

02:32:25.680 --> 02:32:30.160
winning lands that we are going to see in Kingdom Hearts 2 if we had our way

02:32:30.160 --> 02:32:42.160
would be in third place, drum roll, Digimon! Digimon land! I forgot to be specific that I was referring to 0-2 because anything after that kind of sucks.

02:32:42.160 --> 02:32:55.160
So Digimon 0-2 land. Alright. Number 2, drum roll, is Spirited Away. Good pick, good pick. I like that one a lot.

02:32:55.160 --> 02:33:07.440
Alright, and in first place, Breath of Anticipation is Gargoyles is the winner for the land you'd

02:33:07.440 --> 02:33:09.440
most like to see in Kingdom Hearts 2.

02:33:09.440 --> 02:33:12.440
And you know the other one?

02:33:12.440 --> 02:33:13.440
No, I...

02:33:13.440 --> 02:33:14.440
Thank God.

02:33:14.440 --> 02:33:15.440
The other one that...

02:33:15.440 --> 02:33:16.440
Which kind of Chippendales are you talking about, Loki?

02:33:16.440 --> 02:33:17.440
The Rangers, man!

02:33:17.440 --> 02:33:18.440
The rest of the Rangers.

02:33:18.440 --> 02:33:21.440
No, my runner-up, my runner-up, though, was Duckburg.

02:33:21.440 --> 02:33:22.440
Duckburg?

02:33:22.440 --> 02:33:23.440
Oh, from DuckTales?

02:33:23.440 --> 02:33:24.440
DuckTales and Darkwing Duck.

02:33:24.440 --> 02:33:30.440
What about freaking, um, no, Doug? Hello? No one said Doug? He's...

02:33:30.440 --> 02:33:32.440
Patty Mayonnaise!

02:33:32.440 --> 02:33:38.440
Uh, Masorella has a good point. Chip and Dale were in Kingdom Hearts 1, just not their little land.

02:33:38.440 --> 02:33:41.440
But they were the guys on the ship, right?

02:33:41.440 --> 02:33:46.440
Yeah, they sent out the ship. You only saw them for, like, two seconds, and that was their shot.

02:33:46.440 --> 02:33:47.440
Alright.

02:33:47.440 --> 02:33:51.440
I wanna know, if it was the gummy ship, why were there no gummy bears?

02:33:51.440 --> 02:33:53.440
Dude, that would've been cool too!

02:33:53.440 --> 02:33:55.440
The gummy bear universe.

02:33:59.440 --> 02:34:03.440
But it wasn't gummy bear! It was the crappy ship!

02:34:03.440 --> 02:34:09.440
It was the, hi, we're really jealous, we have Star Fox Envy, so we're gonna pretend to be Star Fox but not. We suck.

02:34:11.440 --> 02:34:13.440
Damn you, Squeenix.

02:34:13.440 --> 02:34:18.440
You hope to trade for the, um, to get the damn warp drive so you don't have to go through shootin' every fuckin' thing.

02:34:18.440 --> 02:34:22.440
Okay, I'm not even there yet, cause I loaned you my game.

02:34:22.440 --> 02:34:24.440
What, you mean when you travel between worlds?

02:34:24.440 --> 02:34:26.440
I'm like right before Agrabah.

02:34:26.440 --> 02:34:28.440
Oops.

02:34:28.440 --> 02:34:30.440
I just beat it. But you get the warp drive.

02:34:30.440 --> 02:34:32.440
Give me my game back.

02:34:32.440 --> 02:34:34.440
I wanna beat the Hades Cup.

02:34:34.440 --> 02:34:35.440
Okay, thank you.

02:34:35.440 --> 02:34:37.440
Alright, moving on.

02:34:37.440 --> 02:34:41.440
We're gonna get to a new segment, a brand new segment tonight, yay!

02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:48.400
the new segment of Orange Launch Radio, this is where some of our new regulars get to shine.

02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:49.400
Oh my God!

02:34:49.400 --> 02:34:52.200
And it's the orgasm segment, everybody!

02:34:52.200 --> 02:34:53.200
Holy shit!

02:34:53.200 --> 02:34:54.200
Big orgasm, everybody!

02:34:54.200 --> 02:34:55.200
Oh, Rob!

02:34:55.200 --> 02:34:56.200
This is the best thing in the world!

02:34:56.200 --> 02:34:57.200
No, no.

02:34:57.200 --> 02:34:58.200
It's not the orgasm segment.

02:34:58.200 --> 02:34:59.200
No, that's not it.

02:34:59.200 --> 02:35:00.200
All right.

02:35:00.200 --> 02:35:01.200
It is zero...

02:35:01.200 --> 02:35:02.200
Hello, your turn.

02:35:02.200 --> 02:35:03.200
Oh, hi.

02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:10.200
It is zero and Dark Child's video game review.

02:35:10.200 --> 02:35:16.200
Holy shit, and this is a good song to choose.

02:35:16.200 --> 02:35:23.200
Zero and Dark Child's video game review here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:35:23.200 --> 02:35:28.200
I think BitMania would have just been good by itself.

02:35:28.200 --> 02:35:32.900
I just busted it not seeing that manga really and I haven't even seen the picture inside

02:35:33.540 --> 02:35:36.380
All right, Jamie's showing us battle royale manga right now

02:35:37.620 --> 02:35:39.060
Okay

02:35:39.060 --> 02:35:42.660
I'm about to take that book and drop my pants in the bathroom. Okay?

02:35:43.980 --> 02:35:45.980
I'm about to drop my pants right now

02:35:46.740 --> 02:35:48.740
Thank you. I would aim away

02:35:51.820 --> 02:35:53.820
Back to video games

02:35:53.820 --> 02:36:00.820
Okay, I've decided to make this one not as extensive as last time. It's just going to be a couple random games that we've played throughout the week.

02:36:00.820 --> 02:36:07.820
Number one is starting off with Midnight Club 2, which, if you haven't played it and you have a PS2, go out and rent it, or...

02:36:07.820 --> 02:36:09.820
Buy it. Buy it. Don't rent it. Buy it.

02:36:09.820 --> 02:36:12.820
Well, not everyone's a huge racing fan, so...

02:36:12.820 --> 02:36:14.820
It's still cool.

02:36:14.820 --> 02:36:16.820
What is this, Judgment Day? What the fuck?

02:36:16.820 --> 02:36:18.820
No, um, seriously, if you have a PS2...

02:36:18.820 --> 02:36:23.820
I'm on the 14th of July for the first midnight club racing because I'm SUCKED ASS!

02:36:23.820 --> 02:36:30.820
I want my $5 back!

02:36:53.820 --> 02:36:55.820
Yeah, you start off with an escort.

02:36:55.820 --> 02:36:57.820
Yeah, an escort. What is it they call that?

02:36:57.820 --> 02:36:59.820
Something SI is what they call that.

02:36:59.820 --> 02:37:04.820
Yeah, but it was pretty... The game is good, the graphics are fluid, the music is actually really decent.

02:37:04.820 --> 02:37:10.820
It has some pretty good tracks running through the background. I'm not familiar with artists, but you probably know more than I do.

02:37:10.820 --> 02:37:15.820
There's no one in particular that we really know. Looks like a lot of their own in-house people.

02:37:15.820 --> 02:37:20.020
One good thing about this game also is that, which is something they should have done with

02:37:20.020 --> 02:37:24.540
the first one, is there's a lot of shortcuts you can take to, you know, win races faster

02:37:24.540 --> 02:37:28.120
or hit checkpoints in different orders and stuff like that.

02:37:28.120 --> 02:37:29.860
And the game is fucking hard.

02:37:29.860 --> 02:37:30.860
Yeah, the game is a bitch.

02:37:30.860 --> 02:37:34.520
Alright, you win the first couple races pretty easy, and then like, all of a sudden it jumps

02:37:34.520 --> 02:37:37.580
up and you have to really race them perfectly.

02:37:37.580 --> 02:37:42.220
You wanna talk about a hard race, just race a, just get, drive the motorcycle.

02:37:42.220 --> 02:37:43.220
Oh shit, drive the motorcycle anywhere.

02:37:43.220 --> 02:37:44.220
And watch as you die.

02:37:44.220 --> 02:37:49.220
I thought it was cool because you actually had to lean in order to shift your weight in order to turn a motorcycle.

02:37:49.220 --> 02:37:54.220
So definitely this is a game to buy or rent, depending on how big of a racing fan you are.

02:37:54.220 --> 02:37:57.220
If you're kind of racy, just thinking about it, rent it.

02:37:57.220 --> 02:38:02.220
And if you don't have a PS2 and you have an Xbox, which I don't know why the fuck you'd have an Xbox.

02:38:02.220 --> 02:38:04.220
Maybe just throw it at kids or something.

02:38:04.220 --> 02:38:07.220
Hey, fuck Halo!

02:38:07.220 --> 02:38:09.220
Yeah, I'm going to go with Halo, buddy, I'd like that game.

02:38:09.220 --> 02:38:11.220
Halo sucks ass.

02:38:11.220 --> 02:38:13.220
And the mech game.

02:38:41.220 --> 02:38:45.220
There's no dick-measuring challenges here!

02:38:45.220 --> 02:38:49.220
Anyways, I'm trying to save for the last three minutes.

02:38:49.220 --> 02:38:59.220
If you have an Xbox for god knows what reasons, it's going to be out, I believe, next month for the Xbox with improved graphics and blah blah blah, and wait.

02:38:59.220 --> 02:39:02.220
Of course you need an Xbox! You won't play DDR Xbox!

02:39:02.220 --> 02:39:16.220
I got to play for a short period of time, which is actually really fun, it's at my house, I gotta start playing it more, is Panzer Dragoon Orta for the Xbox.

02:39:16.220 --> 02:39:26.220
That game owns me, and that is sad because I fucking hate the Xbox. But I have to speak unbiased, and that sucks ass.

02:39:26.220 --> 02:39:35.220
First of all, it's Panzer Dragoon Orta. It's SEGA. Microsoft has not tainted this game except to host the game.

02:39:35.220 --> 02:39:38.220
Well, they put their Xbox logo all over the fucking place.

02:39:38.220 --> 02:39:40.220
But besides that, it's SEGA.

02:39:40.220 --> 02:39:42.220
SEGA is now the whore of Xbox.

02:39:42.220 --> 02:39:45.220
You know, there's actual talks of SEGA merging with Namco.

02:39:45.220 --> 02:39:47.220
Yeah, but Xbox is also talking...

02:39:47.220 --> 02:39:54.220
Yeah, originally it wasn't supposed to be EA or Namco, and then Namco decided to put up more money.

02:39:54.220 --> 02:40:01.220
Yeah, it's definitely a good game, nice and smooth, and it's pretty much everything you remember from before.

02:40:01.220 --> 02:40:03.220
Just visually, like, amazing.

02:40:03.220 --> 02:40:08.220
Visually enhanced. You're still doing pretty much the same thing that you did in the very first Panzer Dragoon.

02:40:08.220 --> 02:40:09.220
It's a shooter.

02:40:09.220 --> 02:40:13.220
Yeah, but it's very fun. It's something that you will never get tired of until you beat it.

02:40:13.220 --> 02:40:19.220
And there's so much stuff to unlock. You can unlock the original Panzer Dragoon, also on Dreamcast, you can unlock that.

02:40:19.220 --> 02:40:23.220
There's a whole bunch of different Dragoons you can unlock for you to change to.

02:40:23.220 --> 02:40:25.980
You mean, why do you mean Dreamcast, you mean Saturn?

02:40:25.980 --> 02:40:26.980
Sorry, Saturn.

02:40:26.980 --> 02:40:27.980
Oh my god.

02:40:27.980 --> 02:40:34.140
But, um, yeah, definitely, she keeps showing me this fucking book and it's like, yeah.

02:40:34.140 --> 02:40:35.140
Anyways, and-

02:40:35.140 --> 02:40:36.140
Ugh!

02:40:36.140 --> 02:40:37.140
Ugh!

02:40:37.140 --> 02:40:38.140
Ugh!

02:40:38.140 --> 02:40:39.140
Ugh!

02:40:39.140 --> 02:40:40.140
Oh, that was good.

02:40:40.140 --> 02:40:45.660
Just to go back to old school, let's, let's take a trip back to TimeSplitters 2.

02:40:45.660 --> 02:40:46.660
This is-

02:40:46.660 --> 02:40:47.660
If we're traveling back in time to this one.

02:40:47.660 --> 02:40:48.660
The funniest game.

02:40:48.660 --> 02:40:52.200
We're not traveling back hell of far, but we're going back a little while.

02:40:52.200 --> 02:40:59.200
This game is hilarious except for the fact that you will probably never ever unlock absolutely

02:40:59.200 --> 02:41:00.480
everything in this game.

02:41:00.480 --> 02:41:04.600
I've been playing it since it came out and I still don't even have half the characters

02:41:04.600 --> 02:41:05.600
unlocked.

02:41:05.600 --> 02:41:09.300
The cool thing about this game is that, well the thing that Jim and I were playing last

02:41:09.300 --> 02:41:12.240
night is that you can have a fire extinguisher and brick fight.

02:41:12.240 --> 02:41:17.280
You sit there and throw bricks at each other.

02:41:17.280 --> 02:41:24.440
The coolest thing was, I was a monkey, and Jim was one of the sergeant guys.

02:41:24.440 --> 02:41:30.160
The monkey is a foot and a half tall, and then you got, the sergeant guy was like 6'6".

02:41:30.160 --> 02:41:33.120
So this guy's punching over your hand, I'm just walking up sucker punching him, and the

02:41:33.120 --> 02:41:35.960
monkey has hella power, but no stamina.

02:41:35.960 --> 02:41:42.320
Yeah, I'm having to look down all the time just to hit him, but for some reason he's

02:41:42.320 --> 02:41:47.120
just so goddamn quick, all my shots just constantly keep missing, and he's constantly getting

02:41:47.120 --> 02:41:53.200
and a good few sucker punches on me. And he kicked the crap out of me, and he's a frickin'

02:41:53.200 --> 02:41:54.200
monkey, so.

02:41:54.200 --> 02:41:57.400
Because I was a monkey. The monkey, it's all about monkey power. Anyways.

02:41:57.400 --> 02:41:59.040
That goddamn meekie!

02:41:59.040 --> 02:42:05.200
Yeah. Basically, the game, the graphics are really good. You gotta love the facial expressions.

02:42:05.200 --> 02:42:08.200
The facial expressions and the voice acting.

02:42:08.200 --> 02:42:13.120
The voice acting is probably one of the best that I've seen in a game in a long time.

02:42:13.120 --> 02:42:16.800
And I like the fact that they did, the facial expressions and everything was very cartoony,

02:42:16.800 --> 02:42:21.320
like it should be. They weren't trying to be realistic people who were over-exaggerated

02:42:21.320 --> 02:42:22.320
by counters.

02:42:22.320 --> 02:42:23.320
Yeah, they weren't trying to be serious. We're not trying to go fucking Half-Life or Counter-Strike,

02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:24.320
which is fun to play.

02:42:24.320 --> 02:42:27.860
And they had the big-breasted chicks, just like the first one.

02:42:27.860 --> 02:42:29.460
Dude, the Jungle Queen.

02:42:29.460 --> 02:42:30.460
Jungle Queen?

02:42:30.460 --> 02:42:31.460
Jungle Queen.

02:42:31.460 --> 02:42:32.460
Jungle Queen.

02:42:32.460 --> 02:42:36.300
Dude, okay. She has shit cover in the front, but her ass is totally exposed to the back.

02:42:36.300 --> 02:42:38.920
Yeah, it's a cheetah thong that doesn't really have a backstrap.

02:42:38.920 --> 02:42:41.500
Yeah, it's like velcro to her skin or something.

02:42:41.500 --> 02:42:42.500
Yeah.

02:42:42.500 --> 02:42:43.500
It's paint.

02:42:43.500 --> 02:42:44.500
It's paint or something.

02:42:44.500 --> 02:42:46.500
Maybe it's all natural. Who knows?

02:42:46.500 --> 02:42:54.500
Basically, if you want a game to eat up time, do time splitters. It's fun, and there's so much shit to unlock.

02:42:54.500 --> 02:43:01.500
Anna has a level editor, which is the greatest thing in the world. If you want to fuck around with your friends, make an insane level.

02:43:01.500 --> 02:43:12.500
Also, like I said before, you'll probably never unlock everything, and also you can unlock minigames like Snake. It's called Anaconda, though, and it's actually a lot better.

02:43:12.500 --> 02:43:16.500
Johnny just brought up something I should maybe ring up since it's video games.

02:43:16.500 --> 02:43:17.500
What?

02:43:17.500 --> 02:43:22.500
It's not out yet, but Far Cry. A demo I recommend everyone watch to see what this game's going to look like.

02:43:22.500 --> 02:43:25.500
And it's on PC, it's not a console game.

02:43:25.500 --> 02:43:27.500
Yeah, that would suck.

02:43:27.500 --> 02:43:30.500
Once it comes out though, I'll make sure I have a review for you guys.

02:43:30.500 --> 02:43:35.500
Right now there's not a whole lot going on on the PC front that's worth talking about game-wise.

02:43:35.500 --> 02:43:37.500
Vice City's coming out, that's about it.

02:43:37.500 --> 02:43:40.500
Who the hell cares? I mean, seriously, if you haven't fucking played Vice City by now...

02:43:40.500 --> 02:43:41.500
You suck.

02:43:41.500 --> 02:43:43.500
What the hell are you even doing on the face of the earth?

02:43:43.500 --> 02:43:44.500
I just showed up.

02:43:44.500 --> 02:43:45.500
Say hello to Brad.

02:43:45.500 --> 02:43:51.500
I just showed up and the reason why you wouldn't play Vice City on PS2 and you want to play on PC is because it looks like shit on PS2.

02:43:51.500 --> 02:43:53.500
And it's going to look really good on PC. There you go.

02:43:54.500 --> 02:43:55.500
And you're on MP3s too.

02:43:55.500 --> 02:43:56.500
There you go.

02:43:57.500 --> 02:43:58.500
Okay, well yeah, basically...

02:43:58.500 --> 02:43:59.500
And your own cars.

02:43:59.500 --> 02:44:01.500
Um, I don't know, unless you can think of...

02:44:03.500 --> 02:44:05.500
Dude! Okay, hold on. Everybody play the getaway.

02:44:05.500 --> 02:44:07.500
play the getaway

02:44:07.500 --> 02:44:09.340
played the fucking getaway okay

02:44:09.340 --> 02:44:14.460
you will hear the word fuck in the opening scene at least fifty fucking times

02:44:14.460 --> 02:44:17.720
and it's funny when you hear them random american guy in there

02:44:17.720 --> 02:44:20.700
like he crashed his car and goes hey i just painted that

02:44:20.700 --> 02:44:24.380
and fuck in the middle of fucking uk yeah

02:44:24.380 --> 02:44:25.820
there's okay

02:44:25.820 --> 02:44:27.420
i'm sitting here playing

02:44:27.420 --> 02:44:30.300
and cara's over my house and this guy says

02:44:30.300 --> 02:44:34.620
i need to get your details and someone thought he said i need my cheetos anyways

02:44:34.620 --> 02:44:36.620
I can't think of anything else. That's pretty much the end of it for this week.

02:44:36.620 --> 02:44:38.620
I can't think of another fucking bloody fucking thing.

02:44:38.620 --> 02:44:40.620
Play Counter-Strike online.

02:44:40.620 --> 02:44:42.620
Kill Johnny.

02:44:42.620 --> 02:44:44.620
Because he's really good at that.

02:44:44.620 --> 02:44:50.620
Kill anyone that says 9, the number 9, 1, and then the number 6 in their name.

02:44:50.620 --> 02:44:52.620
Because they suck and they all die.

02:44:52.620 --> 02:44:54.620
Hey, my first day playing I was killing people.

02:44:54.620 --> 02:44:58.620
And his name's Unstoppable. If you find 916, Unstoppable.

02:44:58.620 --> 02:45:00.620
And now I have my retro review.

02:45:00.620 --> 02:45:05.420
if you if you go after eighty team nine one six you will die trust me you after

02:45:05.420 --> 02:45:08.460
nine one six you will die

02:45:08.460 --> 02:45:11.500
that's the end of the game segment alright he wants to say something

02:45:11.500 --> 02:45:13.220
uh... yes loki

02:45:13.220 --> 02:45:17.400
uh... also being released they mentioned this weeks weeks months ago

02:45:17.400 --> 02:45:21.500
uh... is going to be one must fall battlegrounds the three d fighter

02:45:21.500 --> 02:45:23.900
ooh, did that come out?

02:45:23.900 --> 02:45:27.660
well anyways i couldn't beta test it because the fucking thing wouldn't work on dial-up

02:45:27.660 --> 02:45:29.480
yet they just gave it to me anyways

02:45:29.480 --> 02:45:33.280
I have a demo, a really early demo, and I'm not beta testing it anymore, unfortunately.

02:45:33.280 --> 02:45:35.120
But it's coming out, so look for it.

02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:36.120
It looks really sweet.

02:45:36.120 --> 02:45:37.120
They've got really kick-ass arenas.

02:45:37.120 --> 02:45:40.920
They reproduce all the robots, like, perfectly and added more, and it's really fun.

02:45:40.920 --> 02:45:43.680
They've got, like, a bunch of different modes you can play in.

02:45:43.680 --> 02:45:47.200
Like, they have, like, a sports-type thing where it's, like, some sort of soccer-type

02:45:47.200 --> 02:45:50.480
thing, and then, like, just death matches and crazy shit like that.

02:45:50.480 --> 02:45:51.960
All right, something...

02:45:51.960 --> 02:45:52.960
Oh.

02:45:52.960 --> 02:45:55.520
The Scatman needs to be the theme for this.

02:45:55.520 --> 02:45:57.120
No, it's listless now.

02:45:57.120 --> 02:45:58.120
Oh.

02:45:58.120 --> 02:45:59.120
All right.

02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:05.840
to bring to the table. Retro review. Retro review. Space Harrier on the 32X. It's the

02:46:05.840 --> 02:46:16.200
arcade version, end of story. Beautiful. Welcome to the fantasy zone, get ready. If you guys

02:46:16.200 --> 02:46:23.320
actually want us to review new games, be sure to tell me so that I can actually get out

02:46:23.320 --> 02:46:28.800
there and test them because seriously, I have no idea what you guys want to know about so

02:46:28.800 --> 02:46:33.960
Drop me a line either in the chat room or email me or something.

02:46:33.960 --> 02:46:35.400
Most people have my information.

02:46:35.400 --> 02:46:36.400
That's it.

02:46:36.400 --> 02:46:37.400
Alright.

02:46:37.400 --> 02:46:43.560
Hopefully, I don't know when they're shipping out the ship from, um, for DDR Max 2.

02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:47.160
Maybe not next week, but hopefully a week after we'll have a review on DDR Max 2.

02:46:47.160 --> 02:46:49.320
Uh, yes, because it's coming out this week, right?

02:46:49.320 --> 02:46:52.280
Yeah, I've got mine already preordered and everything, but I don't know if they ship

02:46:52.280 --> 02:46:55.400
them to arrive at your, like, house today.

02:46:55.400 --> 02:46:56.400
Yeah.

02:46:56.400 --> 02:46:59.400
I think they ship it on that date, so in which case I'll get it the week after.

02:46:59.400 --> 02:47:04.400
If we're able to get our hands on it this week, look for Orange Lounge Radio to go live the night we get it.

02:47:04.400 --> 02:47:09.400
Bring it over, we'll go live with it the night we get it, and we'll play the new stuff for you right off the bat.

02:47:09.400 --> 02:47:11.400
We'll unlock stuff on-air and play them.

02:47:11.400 --> 02:47:16.400
Yeah, I'll do the controller trick, man, and fucking unlock the whole fucking game in one night.

02:47:16.400 --> 02:47:30.520
Alright, while they drool over Battle Royale manga, we've only got ten minutes left in

02:47:30.520 --> 02:47:41.920
the show, but we're going to do a favorite segment of ours called Ask Orange Lounge.

02:47:41.920 --> 02:47:48.700
This is where you can ask us whatever you want, send us questions over a private message

02:47:48.700 --> 02:47:50.100
in the chat room.

02:47:50.100 --> 02:47:54.700
However, some of your questions in the past have really sucked.

02:47:54.700 --> 02:47:57.540
Like, will you give me money?

02:47:57.540 --> 02:47:58.540
Will you buy me this?

02:47:58.540 --> 02:47:59.540
Will you do this?

02:47:59.540 --> 02:48:00.540
No.

02:48:00.540 --> 02:48:03.540
Stupid questions are not getting asked anymore on the show, so please send us something that's

02:48:03.540 --> 02:48:04.540
worth answering.

02:48:04.540 --> 02:48:05.540
Thank you.

02:48:05.540 --> 02:48:09.540
If you ask a stupid question, you'll be kicked, didn't you?

02:48:09.540 --> 02:48:10.540
Yeah.

02:48:10.540 --> 02:48:11.540
Alright.

02:48:11.540 --> 02:48:20.540
I welcome your questions. We do like to say that there's no such question as a stupid question, but are you going to buy me this as a stupid question? I'm sorry.

02:48:20.540 --> 02:48:28.540
If you ask the question, am I stupid?, we're all going to have a nice, big yes for you. Have a nice day. That's from me.

02:48:28.540 --> 02:48:32.540
Here we go.

02:48:32.540 --> 02:48:36.540
Hmm, all right.

02:48:36.540 --> 02:48:41.540
23rd Magus has a question, and it's kind of a personal life question that nobody else

02:48:41.540 --> 02:48:45.540
that, or nobody that doesn't chat in Orange Lounge regularly is probably going to get.

02:48:45.540 --> 02:48:51.540
But he does want to ask, he does want to ask, who loaned him enough balls to get Angel a ring?

02:48:51.540 --> 02:48:52.540
He did.

02:48:52.540 --> 02:48:54.540
He did!

02:48:54.540 --> 02:48:57.540
I have a return question. Why are you even asking us?

02:48:57.540 --> 02:48:59.540
Yeah, you know who gave you the balls.

02:49:00.540 --> 02:49:10.540
I mean, I would say, um, I would say, uh, when you're up on the altar, that's gonna take, like, 50 times the balls.

02:49:10.540 --> 02:49:11.540
Because he gave them the balls!

02:49:11.540 --> 02:49:15.540
Not to jump to conclusions here, because, you know, these are long ways off in the future.

02:49:15.540 --> 02:49:21.540
I had a great idea for a mat that had different conclusions on it, and you would jump to them.

02:49:21.540 --> 02:49:23.540
Yeah, I'm kind of jumping to conclusions here.

02:49:23.540 --> 02:49:28.540
But it's just one small step. It's more of a case of money than balls.

02:49:28.540 --> 02:49:32.540
I mean, there's not really balls involved. You like a girl, you buy her something.

02:49:32.540 --> 02:49:35.540
There's really no balls involved in that. That's just money.

02:49:35.540 --> 02:49:36.540
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:49:36.540 --> 02:49:42.540
When we get into the longer-term commitment stuff, that's going to be the really ballsy stuff.

02:49:42.540 --> 02:49:43.540
That's what I'm trying to say.

02:49:43.540 --> 02:49:45.540
Stop patting your ego.

02:49:45.540 --> 02:49:48.540
Stop patting your ego.

02:49:48.540 --> 02:49:50.540
Stop. Right now.

02:49:50.540 --> 02:49:52.540
Darkchild has something to add?

02:49:52.540 --> 02:49:55.540
Someone wanted to get balls from someone and I wasn't asked to donate?

02:49:59.540 --> 02:50:00.540
Alright.

02:50:00.540 --> 02:50:02.540
I have a question. Why don't we have a panda mic?

02:50:04.540 --> 02:50:11.540
Jonas, if you're listening, I gave you $2 a long time ago at the tournament to get me a balls and you never got it for me.

02:50:12.540 --> 02:50:14.540
Okay, fine then. Since he procced up someone I want your money.

02:50:14.540 --> 02:50:19.540
RoboZ, if you're fucking listening, you still owe me $3 from fucking MGL2.

02:50:19.540 --> 02:50:22.540
I don't want my money, I want a ball, dammit.

02:50:49.540 --> 02:50:54.540
I found an MP3 that sounds good that would work with something else, and that's what I normally do.

02:50:54.540 --> 02:50:56.540
I don't really think of it beforehand.

02:50:56.540 --> 02:50:59.540
So nothing yet except maybe ghosts, maybe.

02:50:59.540 --> 02:51:01.540
Maybe, maybe ghosts. I tried it, it was alright.

02:51:01.540 --> 02:51:06.540
There was another one I heard that I thought I could mix with insertion, but I don't know.

02:51:06.540 --> 02:51:09.540
I might, yeah, we'll see.

02:51:11.540 --> 02:51:15.540
I have to wait until I get my vinyl, because my vinyl's coming, and then, yeah.

02:51:15.540 --> 02:51:29.540
Yeah, there's going to be, you know, obviously the show's going to be getting a new Thursday night event, well, at some point in season 3, or it's going to be the live mix show, in the mix vinyl on air.

02:51:29.540 --> 02:51:37.540
That's going to be pretty awesome. That'll be one to listen for. Okay, we're moving right along. I've got a lot of questions to get through in only a few more minutes.

02:51:37.540 --> 02:51:42.540
Okay, here we go. Zero. Question for Zero from 23rd Magus.

02:51:42.540 --> 02:51:43.540
I'm scared.

02:51:43.540 --> 02:51:47.540
Zero, what would you do with two Quai Jap girls, a bucket of Choco Ready Whip, and cake pie?

02:51:50.540 --> 02:51:57.540
Yeah, what wouldn't I do? Oh, fuck you, pal. No, first of all, they have to be of age. Thank you.

02:51:58.540 --> 02:52:04.540
He may say of age, but, you know, I will travel to the state where it is legal.

02:52:04.540 --> 02:52:05.540
La la la la la.

02:52:05.540 --> 02:52:10.540
Well, actually, unless it was the UK, because 16 is, you know, their...

02:52:10.540 --> 02:52:12.540
Hawaii, 14.

02:52:12.540 --> 02:52:13.540
Hawaii $5.00.

02:52:13.540 --> 02:52:16.540
Oh my lord, is that your answer? What wouldn't you do? Or do you have a better answer?

02:52:16.540 --> 02:52:25.540
No, okay, I would do pretty much everything within reason. I wouldn't go, like, pour them out to animals or something.

02:52:25.540 --> 02:52:30.540
And what about cake pie? You wouldn't make them eat the cake pie?

02:52:30.540 --> 02:52:32.540
Anyway...

02:52:32.540 --> 02:52:33.540
You wouldn't make them eat something.

02:52:33.540 --> 02:52:39.540
Hey Loki, about your Hawaii comment, they gotta have grass on the field before you can play ball.

02:52:42.540 --> 02:52:43.540
It's a, you know...

02:52:45.540 --> 02:52:48.540
Just because the grass grows does mean it needs to be there.

02:52:49.540 --> 02:52:51.540
Oh my fucking god.

02:52:54.540 --> 02:52:56.540
Moving right along.

02:52:57.540 --> 02:53:00.540
Akuma GM has a good question.

02:53:00.540 --> 02:53:05.540
Does Beatmania 2DX have a chance in the US?

02:53:05.540 --> 02:53:08.540
Why? Why no, Zero? Why no?

02:53:08.540 --> 02:53:12.540
Do we really want to let them ruin another good game?

02:53:12.540 --> 02:53:17.540
If a goat can sing in American Idol, anything's possible.

02:53:17.540 --> 02:53:23.540
Let them move! Let them move!

02:53:23.540 --> 02:53:27.540
If DDR US Mix was allowed, anything could happen.

02:53:27.540 --> 02:53:32.540
I second that notion. If DDR-US mix is allowed, 2DX-US mix can't be far behind.

02:53:32.540 --> 02:53:34.540
DDR-USA did not happen.

02:53:34.540 --> 02:53:39.540
Alright. I'm cutting off questions now. These last five questions I have are it.

02:53:39.540 --> 02:53:46.540
Okay. Vidpala, why does cereal cost so much, and what is your favorite cereal?

02:53:46.540 --> 02:53:52.540
I like Frosted Mini Wheats. I want to answer your other question.

02:53:52.540 --> 02:53:57.540
If you go to Bel Air or Safeway, they have two boxes of cereal for four dollars.

02:53:57.540 --> 02:54:03.540
All the Kellogg's brands. And besides, I like Apple Jacks. Because I just do.

02:54:03.540 --> 02:54:05.540
They don't taste like apples!

02:54:05.540 --> 02:54:07.540
They don't taste like apples, stupid!

02:54:07.540 --> 02:54:09.540
What's wrong with you?

02:54:09.540 --> 02:54:11.540
That's not an answer! They didn't really have an answer.

02:54:11.540 --> 02:54:12.540
I have another favorite.

02:54:12.540 --> 02:54:13.540
Crackle Jacks.

02:54:13.540 --> 02:54:14.540
I like Crackle and Oat Bran.

02:54:14.540 --> 02:54:16.540
Crackle and Oat Bran. Go for it.

02:54:18.540 --> 02:54:20.540
It doesn't crackle like Snap Crackle Pop.

02:54:20.540 --> 02:54:22.540
Alright, let's move on, because we've got a bunch of questions to get through.

02:54:22.540 --> 02:54:27.540
Alright, um, I like Special K and Fruity Pebbles in Captain Crunch.

02:54:27.540 --> 02:54:29.540
It depends what kind of mood I'm in.

02:54:29.540 --> 02:54:32.540
Healthy, you know, I go with Special K.

02:54:32.540 --> 02:54:34.540
Fruity, I go with Fruity Pebbles.

02:54:34.540 --> 02:54:39.540
And just damn Cavity, you know, juicing, I go with Captain Crunch.

02:54:39.540 --> 02:54:41.540
And why cereal so expensive? Because it's all the damn toys.

02:54:41.540 --> 02:54:43.540
And it sponsors terrorism.

02:54:43.540 --> 02:54:48.540
You know, actually, I used to name my stepbrother Special K.

02:54:48.540 --> 02:54:54.620
Now, why it costs so much, it's because it's somehow in some form controlled by the government.

02:54:54.620 --> 02:54:55.620
I don't know how.

02:54:55.620 --> 02:54:56.620
I'll figure that out later.

02:54:56.620 --> 02:54:59.500
But I like to eat what I have for breakfast this morning, but normally I'll just take

02:54:59.500 --> 02:55:04.620
any kind of cereal and just mix them all together and add sugar and a little bit of milk, just

02:55:04.620 --> 02:55:05.620
all the cereals together.

02:55:05.620 --> 02:55:06.620
That way you get the best of all.

02:55:06.620 --> 02:55:11.460
You get the marshmallows, the apple jacks that don't taste like apples, the crackling

02:55:11.460 --> 02:55:13.860
goat brain, and...

02:55:13.860 --> 02:55:19.860
Donnie Darko Rock, Cellar Door, Cellar Door!

02:55:19.860 --> 02:55:21.860
What you ate for breakfast this morning?

02:55:21.860 --> 02:55:23.860
Shut up!

02:55:30.860 --> 02:55:36.860
I had some of these little Japanese candies that have been sitting by the computer for a couple of days.

02:55:36.860 --> 02:55:43.180
Yeah, okay my favorite cereal. I don't need a lot of cereal, but when I do eat cereal my favorite is the Pop's

02:55:43.700 --> 02:55:45.700
Pop's Pop's

02:55:47.300 --> 02:55:49.300
The Pop's

02:55:49.500 --> 02:55:54.980
Corn Pop's yeah, but yeah Corn Pop's those are jamming okay, and the reason why?

02:55:55.820 --> 02:56:00.580
The reason why cereal is so expensive is because it's owned by Disney I

02:56:00.580 --> 02:56:06.620
I say, if you think it's expensive, just go buy it at Sam's Club or Costco and buy me

02:56:06.620 --> 02:56:09.140
a big box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, please. Thank you.

02:56:09.140 --> 02:56:14.580
All right. Quick questions. Here we go. No Styling wants to know, when will Orange Lounge

02:56:14.580 --> 02:56:18.860
be available for DVD or CD? Unfortunately, due to the music that we play during the show,

02:56:18.860 --> 02:56:26.100
we can't really sell it. As far as the content's concerns, we're still debating kind of the

02:56:26.100 --> 02:56:29.780
whole Internet distribution thing, especially now that some of our episodes are, get this,

02:56:29.780 --> 02:56:34.500
a year old, getting there. We're thinking about letting those get distributed on Loki's

02:56:34.500 --> 02:56:40.580
site later, so. But as far as, like, a CD stuff, it's not really a point. Maybe a clip

02:56:40.580 --> 02:56:44.940
CD or something. But fortunately, the quality of the show, since we, well, the problem is

02:56:44.940 --> 02:56:48.780
is that we're so, we're so low, because of the modem band, the quality of the show's

02:56:48.780 --> 02:56:55.640
really low, there wouldn't be much point to do an audio CD. It would kind of suck.

02:56:55.640 --> 02:57:03.640
Two questions. RYC3, this is kind of for Zero and Darkchild, wants to know, Rice wants to know if you will do a game review on Raven Shield.

02:57:03.640 --> 02:57:05.640
What is that on?

02:57:05.640 --> 02:57:09.640
We covered Raven Shield of Liberty, or I did, back at the tournament weekend.

02:57:09.640 --> 02:57:12.640
We didn't have much talk about it though. We can check it out again.

02:57:12.640 --> 02:57:20.640
Once they come out with a patch that allows it to be played on my computer, because it detects a back graphics card, then we'll review it.

02:57:20.640 --> 02:57:30.640
I just saw something. I wonder if we can actually dual record the show, like record an archive file and record a high resolution, like a high quality file.

02:57:30.640 --> 02:57:33.640
What if I had a really good computer?

02:57:33.640 --> 02:57:37.640
I've thought about it and there's a way to do it and maybe when we move. We'll see.

02:57:37.640 --> 02:57:47.640
I'll try to do one on Raven Shield for you. Give me a couple weeks to find it and get it set up and I'll have it taken care of.

02:57:47.640 --> 02:57:51.140
this is the style tone

02:57:51.140 --> 02:57:52.440
alright so here we go

02:57:52.440 --> 02:57:55.520
uh... last questions from snugdwarf

02:57:55.520 --> 02:57:59.340
last question from you OK

02:57:59.340 --> 02:58:03.640
is being my paradise not of the major ass suck? I personally hate that song the

02:58:03.640 --> 02:58:06.440
steps the fact that it's on DDR but i was wondering what you guys think of

02:58:06.440 --> 02:58:08.360
that stinky piece of elephant poop

02:58:08.360 --> 02:58:11.760
I love that song since i saw Wendell freestyle it

02:58:11.760 --> 02:58:14.480
uh... the song itself

02:58:14.480 --> 02:58:20.480
This sucks, um, I can't think of anything violent. It sucks Smegma.

02:58:22.480 --> 02:58:26.480
I thought it was time, but I like all the songs that nobody likes, so there you go.

02:58:26.480 --> 02:58:32.480
But you know, to be honest, a lot of the club mix stuff really sucks. I mean, the original Jam Jam Reggae sucks.

02:58:32.480 --> 02:58:33.480
Jam Jam Reggae sucks.

02:58:33.480 --> 02:58:35.480
Like, Emotion, Emotion sucks ass.

02:58:35.480 --> 02:58:36.480
Emotion sucks ass.

02:58:36.480 --> 02:58:42.480
Okay, Emotion sucks ass on there because it sounds like they just recorded someone doing just the key presses of it.

02:58:42.480 --> 02:58:46.560
even like recorded good or anything

02:58:46.560 --> 02:58:49.800
and uh... also but the my parents is all right

02:58:49.800 --> 02:58:53.620
this episode step suck ass is really slow

02:58:53.620 --> 02:58:56.760
and the new double steps they made for really suck because they're just

02:58:56.760 --> 02:58:58.140
trying to throw in a bunch of

02:58:58.140 --> 02:59:01.560
sixty note running for no apparent reason

02:59:01.560 --> 02:59:06.720
i'd like to see

02:59:06.720 --> 02:59:08.280
uh... be repaired arabic

02:59:08.280 --> 02:59:13.280
Mr. Wendell, like, did this badass freestyle to it, and big guy freestyles kick ass. I'm sorry.

02:59:13.280 --> 02:59:24.280
Yeah, my appreciation for Be My Paradise went up like tenfold when I saw Wendell humping Mel to it, so that was homoerotic. Wonderful.

02:59:24.280 --> 02:59:28.280
I appreciate Wendell. I don't appreciate the song.

02:59:28.280 --> 02:59:31.280
We love Wendell. We need Wendell on this show.

02:59:31.280 --> 02:59:36.680
Alright, one more question from Snubdismoid wants to know,

02:59:36.680 --> 02:59:38.880
Loki or anyone that makes edits in the room,

02:59:38.880 --> 02:59:42.560
I just recently made an Afro Nova edit, but when I put the steps in the DDR edit max,

02:59:42.560 --> 02:59:45.200
I was two measures short, too many steps.

02:59:45.200 --> 02:59:49.680
I have some extra steps before the normal steps start, so should I just eliminate those?

02:59:49.680 --> 02:59:54.120
No, because DDR edit max, a lot of the gaps that sit on there are wrong.

02:59:54.120 --> 02:59:58.680
I'm gonna fix that at some point, because there's a lot of steps that are out of sync,

02:59:58.680 --> 03:00:05.120
or you'll be in sync on ddr edit max

03:00:05.120 --> 03:00:07.560
you are loose anyways

03:00:07.560 --> 03:00:09.520
now there's a lot of uh...

03:00:09.520 --> 03:00:13.640
a lot of songs where you can make the steps on there i think what was it dynamite raver one of those

03:00:13.640 --> 03:00:17.560
was one of the ones that you make on ddr edit max and then

03:00:17.560 --> 03:00:21.380
he gets all fucked up when you play on the arcade it's like two bars short or something like that

03:00:21.380 --> 03:00:25.320
uh... just what i recommend doing is if you've got something to make an

03:00:55.320 --> 03:00:58.320
And just fix it that way. That's what I did.

03:00:58.320 --> 03:01:06.320
Yeah, that's pretty much it. I'm going to try to fix all of those so that I can, you know, that can be correct.

03:01:06.320 --> 03:01:11.320
But that will come later on. It's on the bottom of my list.

03:01:11.320 --> 03:01:14.320
All right, that's it. All the questions from Ask Orange Lounge have been asked.

03:01:14.320 --> 03:01:16.320
Thank you very much for submitting your questions. We love you.

03:01:16.320 --> 03:01:21.320
And now it's show end time and we ask everybody for their final thoughts.

03:01:21.320 --> 03:01:25.520
final thoughts. You want to go first, Jimmy? You want to wait and let her wait. Zero, final

03:01:25.520 --> 03:01:42.520
thought. Nice catch. I fit under a desk. Just like an intern to be fitting under a desk.

03:01:42.520 --> 03:01:46.600
Shut up, dick. While you're down there. Fuck your mama. I have dusting that needs to be

03:01:46.600 --> 03:01:47.600
be done while you're down there.

03:01:47.600 --> 03:01:48.600
All right.

03:01:48.600 --> 03:01:49.600
I'm on my ass.

03:01:49.600 --> 03:01:50.600
No.

03:01:50.600 --> 03:01:51.600
Jim, final thought.

03:01:51.600 --> 03:01:52.600
Final thought?

03:01:52.600 --> 03:01:58.760
Well, this is a pretty cool show for listening to it for my first time, and it kind of makes

03:01:58.760 --> 03:02:01.680
me wish I lived up here to listen to it every single week, so...

03:02:01.680 --> 03:02:02.680
We roll.

03:02:02.680 --> 03:02:03.680
Thanks.

03:02:03.680 --> 03:02:04.680
Yeah.

03:02:04.680 --> 03:02:05.680
Keep rocking.

03:02:05.680 --> 03:02:06.680
Welcome to the show.

03:02:06.680 --> 03:02:07.680
Listen to the show.

03:02:07.680 --> 03:02:08.680
Well...

03:02:08.680 --> 03:02:16.060
Hey, on your first show, you picked the listless thing that ended up winning, so that's not

03:02:16.060 --> 03:02:17.060
Not too shabby.

03:02:17.060 --> 03:02:20.060
I don't know how I did it, because my two other picks got knocked off.

03:02:20.060 --> 03:02:22.060
Yeah, you kind of had crappy ones out of that.

03:02:22.060 --> 03:02:24.060
But, you know, Garlic Rose was good.

03:02:24.060 --> 03:02:25.060
It's all right.

03:02:25.060 --> 03:02:26.060
It's all right, you're a noob.

03:02:26.060 --> 03:02:28.060
I'm just kind of having a bad day.

03:02:28.060 --> 03:02:32.060
What I want to come up with, you know, just isn't coming up.

03:02:32.060 --> 03:02:33.060
We love noobs on Orange Lounge.

03:02:33.060 --> 03:02:34.060
Noobs love us.

03:02:34.060 --> 03:02:35.060
All right.

03:02:35.060 --> 03:02:36.060
All right.

03:02:36.060 --> 03:02:37.060
Uh, Loki?

03:02:37.060 --> 03:02:41.060
Um, I'm starting to get a headache.

03:02:41.060 --> 03:02:43.060
I can fucking think my blood pressure's up or something.

03:02:43.060 --> 03:02:47.900
I, like, have bad cholesterol or something like that. I, I don't know what it is. I get

03:02:47.900 --> 03:02:55.720
a headache all the time when I come over here. I don't know why. I don't know what it is.

03:02:55.720 --> 03:03:01.240
I blame Rob. Maybe, maybe you have cat dander on you from your cat and then it's, I'm, that's

03:03:01.240 --> 03:03:07.440
why I have a mild headache. Oh, it's probably shirmy that I'm allergic to. Okay, fuck, okay.

03:03:07.440 --> 03:03:09.440
Alright.

03:03:09.440 --> 03:03:10.440
Sorry to hear that.

03:03:10.440 --> 03:03:11.440
Anita?

03:03:11.440 --> 03:03:18.120
Uh, let's see, um, Captain Picard is a better captain than Captain Kirk, because he rocks.

03:03:18.120 --> 03:03:21.960
He's smarter, and he holds his age better.

03:03:21.960 --> 03:03:22.960
Wow.

03:03:22.960 --> 03:03:28.840
Yeah, but he gets it on in Nemesis, and I really don't want to see that.

03:03:28.840 --> 03:03:29.840
I did.

03:03:29.840 --> 03:03:30.840
Dark child.

03:03:30.840 --> 03:03:32.600
yeah

03:03:32.600 --> 03:03:34.480
dark child

03:03:34.480 --> 03:03:38.400
uh... okay that just made me lose some interest

03:03:38.400 --> 03:03:45.400
uh... final thought

03:03:45.880 --> 03:03:47.780
I don't really have a final

03:03:47.780 --> 03:03:49.280
thought I guess

03:03:49.280 --> 03:03:54.280
I'll just throw out something or say everyone's the same

03:03:54.280 --> 03:03:55.680
What the hell did he just say?

03:03:55.680 --> 03:03:57.520
Bombay your final thought?

03:03:57.520 --> 03:04:01.520
My final thought... I don't have one. I don't have any thoughts right now.

03:04:01.520 --> 03:04:06.520
Alright, um, my final thought of the n-

03:04:06.520 --> 03:04:14.520
My final thought is, you voted, they voted off Legend of Trance after one week, and you fucking kept on, goddamn duck toy! What is wrong with you?

03:04:14.520 --> 03:04:18.520
What is wrong with America?

03:04:18.520 --> 03:04:19.520
Don't get me started.

03:04:19.520 --> 03:04:26.520
My final thought, uh, would be, um, God bless the USA!

03:04:26.520 --> 03:04:38.080
My final thought? Fuck you, Squeenix.

03:04:38.080 --> 03:04:45.160
Very well put. And the last word of tonight goes to...

03:04:45.160 --> 03:04:53.120
You had it before, and so did Anita. Let's give it to Jar-Child. Fine. We'll give it

03:04:53.120 --> 03:04:56.120
Last word!

03:04:56.120 --> 03:04:58.120
Excrement cranium.

03:04:58.120 --> 03:05:01.120

And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:05:22.120 --> 03:05:25.120
I will send a flood to wipe out all the bad things.

03:05:25.120 --> 03:05:30.120
I will save two of everything, but everything else goes, and there'll be a lot of umbrellas.

03:05:30.120 --> 03:05:34.120
You, Noah, stop what you're doing and build me an ark.

03:05:34.120 --> 03:05:37.120
And Noah, who was Sean Connery, who was...

03:05:37.120 --> 03:05:42.120
I'm working on a speedboat at the moment.

03:05:42.120 --> 03:05:47.120
Speedboat's much faster. I'll shoo across the water a lot faster.

03:05:47.120 --> 03:05:49.120
It'd be great photos for the Bible.

03:05:55.120 --> 03:05:58.120
No, I appreciate your sense of publicity, but...

03:05:59.120 --> 03:06:01.120
I want an ark with a big room for poo.

03:06:01.120 --> 03:06:02.120
It's going to be important.

03:06:05.120 --> 03:06:06.120
Speed boat. Let's go for a speed boat.

03:06:06.120 --> 03:06:08.120
We can get all the animals with long ears.

03:06:08.120 --> 03:06:10.120
They can sit along the side of their ears.

03:06:13.120 --> 03:06:14.120
Because I like that.

03:06:15.120 --> 03:06:16.120
No, you build me an ark.

03:06:16.120 --> 03:06:20.160
put a big motor in an arc if you want compromise

03:06:20.160 --> 03:06:23.360
so he started to build himself an arc, started sawing up timber

03:06:23.360 --> 03:06:27.640
hu hu hu hu hu hu, that's not actually how you start sawing is it?

03:06:27.640 --> 03:06:31.920
you start sawing by going hu hu hu hu hu

03:06:31.920 --> 03:06:35.120
that first bit where you

03:06:35.120 --> 03:06:41.160
hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu

03:06:41.160 --> 03:06:45.160
then you're into the middle bit of hu hu hu hu hu

03:06:45.160 --> 03:06:51.440
where you feel like your dad

03:06:51.440 --> 03:06:57.720
when your dad used to say, I'm off out to the garage to saw a plank of wood in our

03:06:57.720 --> 03:06:59.760
kiddo

03:06:59.760 --> 03:07:03.240
there we go

03:07:03.240 --> 03:07:05.360
no reason for it

03:07:05.360 --> 03:07:11.440
now let's see if Dr Banosky is still on television, the assentive man

03:07:11.440 --> 03:07:14.240
sundays with my dad that was

03:07:14.240 --> 03:07:17.880
so yes, so the middle bit of the song

03:07:17.880 --> 03:07:21.960
and then the end goes back into

03:07:21.960 --> 03:07:28.960
and after a while Noah realized he was actually punching a baboon

03:07:33.780 --> 03:07:35.440
get off me, stop telling me

03:07:35.440 --> 03:07:37.560
what have you got against baboons

03:07:37.560 --> 03:07:41.400
I'm not punching a baboon, I'm showing wood for an ark

03:07:41.400 --> 03:07:43.640
ah, a likely story

03:07:43.640 --> 03:07:50.640
Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.

03:08:13.640 --> 03:08:30.160
Alright, kids, we're back, Orange Lounge Radio, the afterbirth.

03:08:30.160 --> 03:08:31.160
Eeee!

03:08:31.160 --> 03:08:37.600
Oh, Dark Child has something to say, yes, Dark Child.

03:08:37.600 --> 03:08:41.280
Okay, since I wasn't here for Fuck You's, I need to say this.

03:08:41.280 --> 03:08:45.920
Fuck you to like 17 and 16 year old girls to try and pimp on like me and zero

03:08:45.920 --> 03:08:48.840
I mean first of all the freestyle is not that cool

03:08:49.560 --> 03:08:55.280
Especially when I'm up there doing it second of all once you find out that we're 22 and 23

03:08:55.840 --> 03:08:57.240
That means you're under age

03:08:57.240 --> 03:09:02.760
We can't do nothing about that then we call us and find out that we're both taken and have girlfriends

03:09:02.920 --> 03:09:07.040
That doesn't mean the next morning you wake my ass up at 10 o'clock in the morning to see what we want to do

03:09:07.040 --> 03:09:12.040
That means we're not available. That means back the fuck up off of us. Get off my jock.

03:09:12.040 --> 03:09:15.040
You know what? At least I was smart enough to give him a wrong phone number.

03:09:15.040 --> 03:09:22.040
What the fuck, man? No one fucking pips on me when I'm doing shit. What the hell is that?

03:09:22.040 --> 03:09:28.040
Oh, I see. I just know I'm not good enough for you.

03:09:28.040 --> 03:09:31.040
I'm not good enough for the underage preteens.

03:09:31.040 --> 03:09:34.040
Oh, I was good enough for you when I used to work pizza and give you a free...

03:09:34.040 --> 03:09:36.040
You want her number?

03:09:36.040 --> 03:09:43.320
I'm just saying it's the whole no ego building thing. You know. Hey, yeah, it's you don't me here. She's underage, but

03:09:43.840 --> 03:09:46.000
You know man a little bit younger

03:09:47.560 --> 03:09:52.440
But no, it's what the fuck that sucks say I guess way they're like

03:09:54.320 --> 03:09:56.320
Whatever

03:09:57.040 --> 03:09:59.040
Anybody else have something I want to say for after birth

03:10:00.120 --> 03:10:02.120
We're talking cosplay go away. I

03:10:02.120 --> 03:10:07.120
I need to start hanging out with you guys, man, because you get hit on by, like, the chicks and stuff.

03:10:07.120 --> 03:10:09.120
Why are you looking at Jamie Lee?

03:10:09.120 --> 03:10:13.120
I got hit on by girls. I was playing Angel's Sanctuary.

03:10:13.120 --> 03:10:14.120
Sweet.

03:10:14.120 --> 03:10:17.120
I had fan girls and fanboys because I was an it.

03:10:17.120 --> 03:10:19.120
I'm going to try and embarrass Rob.

03:10:19.120 --> 03:10:25.120
Another thought in Afterbirth, Rob looks hot with a collar on. I mean, if I was gay or even bi, I'd do him if he had that collar on.

03:10:25.120 --> 03:10:27.120
Oh, the one picture.

03:10:27.120 --> 03:10:38.280
If I was going out to the rage tonight I could get all gothy, but I'm not because I'm a dork.

03:10:38.280 --> 03:10:41.360
That's it, you guys. Thank you very much for listening to Orange Lawn Radio and the Afterbirth

03:10:41.360 --> 03:10:48.120
and the whole Nine Yards. After the show tonight is a whole lot of old music, Bamani music.

03:10:48.120 --> 03:10:52.240

03:10:52.240 --> 03:10:57.040

03:11:25.800 --> 03:11:29.480
before we get to the classical money stuff i had a quick request i am

03:11:29.480 --> 03:11:31.980
granting that she is not dead

03:11:31.980 --> 03:11:33.700
the attitude is not dead

03:11:33.700 --> 03:11:36.760
but that i don't have for what it does tell me but the system is down we're

03:11:36.760 --> 03:11:37.400

Boba anyway, so bye.

03:12:07.400 --> 03:12:31.400
The story's ending, like a fairy tale of a life

03:12:31.400 --> 03:12:35.400
It's raining soon and never

03:12:35.400 --> 03:12:38.400
Are fighting in my mind

03:12:38.400 --> 03:12:41.400
I'm losing you

03:12:41.400 --> 03:12:44.400
Believe me, I'm reaching for you

03:12:44.400 --> 03:12:46.400
Wish you loved me

03:12:46.400 --> 03:12:48.400
I hope we become one

03:12:48.400 --> 03:12:51.400
You expect me to fall in love with you

03:12:51.400 --> 03:12:54.400
Take me to my soul to discover

03:12:54.400 --> 03:12:56.400
The angels

03:12:56.400 --> 03:12:59.400
Like a blind light in my mind

03:12:59.400 --> 03:13:06.400
I'm taking my life to the top to feel alright

03:13:06.400 --> 03:13:32.520
I've found you deep I've been the angel of my heart

03:13:32.520 --> 03:13:34.520
I'm falling for the sense to

03:13:35.520 --> 03:13:37.520
Turn it over all my life

03:13:39.520 --> 03:13:40.520
I wish you love me

03:13:41.520 --> 03:13:43.520

03:14:05.520 --> 03:14:12.520
