00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,000

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,360

this episode.

5
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,660
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

6
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,660
Why did they have to take the word gay?

7
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,660
No! What I expect for Spanish acquisition is gay.

8
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,660
Hey, hey!

9
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,660

Loki.

14
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,660
I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.

15
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,660
What kind of war human being would find that funny?

16
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,700
Orange Lounge Radio.

17
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:43,340
We are live, and this is episode number 40 for April the 13th of 2003.

18
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:52,840
You're tuned into the B-Money scene's most interesting radio station of all things B-Money!

19
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,340

You know her better as Dark Sakura.

23
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,900

00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,440
our tech mass on loki

26
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,780

00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,900

28
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,240

30
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,240
this is great because you can see

31
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,240
with this new mixing board you can still hear me

32
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:41,240
The show is over the hill now.

33
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,800
I know! We're turning 40 tonight! We're over the hill!

34
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,480
You're like magical and stuff.

35
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,720
Does this mean we're going to have a mid-show crisis?

36
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,200
We just went after last week's breakdown mid-show.

37
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh my god! I feel old! I need to go to the first gate!

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,640
Remember how we almost like had a big crisis mid-show last week? Like a giant fight?

39
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,720
Starting with zero? It was so neat.

40
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,460
No, that was just going off on a stupid song. But see, I am

41
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:16,460
the mid-show crisis. Have a good day.

42
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,460
Ooh, we'll have to hear more about that when we come back from the first break.

43
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,460
Sounds like we have a lot to be thankful for this week.

44
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,460
I'm going to have to get rid of the FUs and do a happy segment.

45
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,460
Fuck that!

46
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,460
Okay, fuck that.

47
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,460
I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.

48
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,460
Lots of people saying hello to Zero in the chat room,

49
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,460
including Angel and the other folks here.

50
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:04,460
However, if you want to get in our chat room and say hello, it's easy.

51
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:11,460
It's easy, just go to www.calibomani.com, our friends over there, and click on Orange Lounge and click on Chat.

52
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,460
It's just not supposed to be.

53
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,460
Alright, we're gonna start off this break with what, Jamie?

54
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,460
Crap!

55
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,460
This isn't crap, I like this song.

56
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,460
We're gonna start off with old shit.

57
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:27,460
Old shit, okay, so we're gonna hear some old Bomani music, and we'll be back to talk about a lot of stuff.

58
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,460
There's a lot, a lot, a lot of stuff to talk about this week, and by the way, tonight, you guys, get your friends on the station,

59
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:39,460
tonight we have Kyle Snyder's new single live from March Madness. I'm moist with anticipation.

60
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:45,460
It's a miracle I actually convinced him to sing it a second time, because he kept getting

61
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,460
getting interrupted, he's like, I'm not gonna do it anymore.

62
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:23,460
Smoke it out, when nobody wants to beat anyone, and nobody's backing me

63
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:29,460
I wanna be with the creatures of frames, I'll stand by the lights, watch the rain fall and say

64
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,460
Grab what you can, we'll head for the wild past three

65
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:43,460
La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La

66
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:50,260
Now

67
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,460
Oh

68
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:50,460
When the time has still come, I'm gonna call your name

69
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,460
I don't want to die, you won't get it

70
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,460
Stay with me, Saturday, ladies

71
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:00,460
Stay close to me, cause I wanna see

72
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,460
Wanna see the color of the blue eyes, baby

73
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,460
This is the night, when you see the light

74
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,460
Of the fire burning in my heart for your big love

75
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,460

76
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,460

But you are getting so young, that goes in busy

00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,460
Scared heart attack, a lot of woman talk, a easy die

81
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,460
Took guy to E-Wake, a girl, straight like law

82
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,460
You are a loss of law

83
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,460
Dance with my mom and my money

84
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,460

I'm gonna do this to you

88
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,460
It's like you want, can't do it

89
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,460
You are the one who did everything

90
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,460
You're gonna be alright

91
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,460
I want to make you who you wanna be

92
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,460
Can't fake it now

93
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,460
I can't wait to go out

94
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,460
Just play with you with me all night

95
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,460
Yeah, everyday, everywhere

96
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,460
Come on, come on, make it so I can stay.

97
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,460
This is what, this is what.

98
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,460
I've been forced to pay, but who won?

99
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,460
You can't stay.

100
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,460
Now, I just can't, make it so I can stay.

101
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,460
This is what, this is what.

102
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,460
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here,

103
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,460
informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

104
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:04,460
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

105
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:10,460
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

106
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:42,460
Okay, Japan Man wants to know where in the hell he can get his hands on that new slagwork remix you did that we debuted last week.

107
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:47,460
Um, nowhere right now. I'll put it up later.

108
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,460
Well, where's it going to be?

109
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,460
It's going to be on my site.

110
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,460
Where is your site, for those that don't know?

111
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:57,460
It's going to be www.willddrforfood.net slash leech from Loki.

112
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:03,460
Beautiful. So that's where you can download this new slagwork single. Whenever Loki gets off his butt and puts it up.

113
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:17,160
it up. Yeah. Or you can get it from Dark Sakura because she's got it too. You can beg

114
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,840
one of us in chat and we'll give it to you. Just not during the show because we're trying

115
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,360
to do the show. You have to offer me favors. You have to buy me that hot rod toy. Oh, I

116
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,180
can do this later. Keep going for it, I don't care. You know what, we totally neglected

117
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,480
the sim update last week, so let's just start tonight with the sim update, shall we?

118
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,940
Well, I got ahold of this guy who goes, what the hell is that? Oh, he got food. Not for

119
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,940
me though. Anyways, this guy is shoey. He's just done a bunch of stuff. He's, right now,

120
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:48,620
what he's been doing is like the DDR Game Boy stuff. He has all the sim files for all

121
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:54,900
the DDR Game Boy tracks. So, we've got those. But, we're going to swap our collections.

122
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:59,740
And this guy's got 4,000. And I have 2,000.

123
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,100
well but uh... he has like one of everything he he he

124
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,240
collects like

125
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,560
everything up the site so

126
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,260
you know whereas i might have like one good one for uh... you know

127
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,160
slide work whatever you'll have everything one ever made first light

128
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,360
work with

129
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,960
obviously i don't want to do but

130
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,400
it's cool you know so we're gonna be trading those and that's awesome and i

131
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,680
can't wait to do that

132
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,300
and then uh...

133
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,080
i finally got up all my uh...

134
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,440
uh... job uh...

135
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,360
downloading scripts so that's all up so you can actually get files now pretty

136
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,260
easy just going through the site

137
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,920
and then uh... i'm hopefully trying to do some more updates but it's been kinda hard

138
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,940
because i've been getting ready to pack and stuff and

139
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,680
you're not really been concentrating on doing a site right now so

140
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,640
i don't know uh... right now i'm averaging about one update a month so that's about

141
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,400
you know what we're gonna have been

142
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,880
aside from all that uh...

143
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,240
let's see

144
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,360
definitely check out bamani symptoms because you can always get you know new

145
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,580
files there even though some of them are like rehash old shit but you know a lot

146
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:04,240
of new stuff especially uh utter dude and he he does some really awesome sim

147
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,400
files he's like my number one now only because healing vision doesn't do him

148
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,840
fast enough but he'd be he'd be net my number one if you know oh speaking of

149
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:19,320
healing vision I'm gonna have he's my first sim file creator interview II and

150
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,560
so I've got that coming up along with all of his files so that'll be later on

151
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:36,560
And then, I don't know, just not too much going on. There's, you know, what was it, Havok got a hold of the EuroMix 2 disc, so he's ripping the banners and stuff from that. So hopefully we'll have some clean banners for that.

152
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:52,560
And then, oh, just a bunch of minor stuff. Not really anything new with stepping in, no new releases or anything. Yeah, Zero's files are back up on BimaniSims and, oh, that's pretty much it, you know, not too much.

153
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:59,240
All right.

154
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,240
So happy 40th birthday everybody.

155
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,600
We are 40 weeks old.

156
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,760
Actually we're older than that because we did two pre-taped shows and a pre-empted week

157
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,200
so we're actually somewhere around 43 or 44 years old.

158
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:16,200
But it's the 40th actual show you guys.

159
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,840
Favorite memory from the past 40 episodes.

160
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,840
What do you think?

161
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,080
Favorite memory from the past 40 episodes?

162
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,680
Out of every single show we've done, what was the funniest or best memory that we did?

163
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,080
My debut.

164
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,400
Which was, do you remember what number that was?

165
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
32.

166
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:36,240
I don't remember shit.

167
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,160
You remember, Loki?

168
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,160
I'm thinking.

169
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,160
This should be a list list some week.

170
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,160
We'll do that for 50.

171
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:46,440
I'm thinking because I want to say there was one that I had you guys laughing really hard.

172
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,320
I can't remember what it was.

173
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,480
It was one of the FUs of the week.

174
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,560
I just can't remember.

175
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,440
Anytime I have food, because I'm hungry and I'm broke at

176
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,240
the moment, I haven't taken any money out from the bank.

177
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,520
So I need food, but.

178
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:10,000
I would say episode, probably, either episode number eight,

179
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,720
which was the one, it was a really early episode.

180
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,040
We had DDR Mike and Jazz here.

181
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,720
I remember that, because that's when we had got into the

182
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,760
whole discussion about pantsless rage and

183
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,040
three-titted Emmy.

184
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,040
That's a classic.

185
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,940
and uh... episode i think it was twenty seven that was the one when angel and

186
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,200
stress that there were those are first visit town

187
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200
that was the night

188
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,540
when i realized that orange long to take it over this house

189
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,340
because we're so damn many people here that night you remember that

190
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,500
it's crazy

191
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,620
and i quit myself

192
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,420
i don't know shit

193
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:43,420
some folks in the chat room say their favorite memory is all the poor talk

194
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,760
uh... i like when i had balls

195
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,720
What was that?

196
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,420
I don't know. It was the first time Jonas showed up.

197
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,560
Yeah, where's our balls? Jonas is supposed to bring some for us. We're still missing them.

198
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,300
You having trouble fighting your balls?

199
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,440
Yeah, because I paid him two dollars to go get them.

200
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:06,440
I hope he remembers to get food for me. Sending brainwaves, brainwaves, brainwaves, brainwaves.

201
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,060
Where's what? Video recorder?

202
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,320
Is that it on the ground? Okay. Actually, no. Jonas left stuff here.

203
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,320
My favorite thing was March Madness when I just went off.

204
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,320
I think it was so funny because I pissed people off. I don't know why.

205
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:29,320
Well, then I guess we could say my favorite thing was slowly becoming insane during Shaft.

206
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,320
Oh, yeah. That was classic.

207
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:38,320
I'm sick and I don't care. I want you to die. I'm hungry. Ooh, food.

208
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,320
Yes. I like that.

209
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:50,320
To avoid our coverage of Shaft and March Madness, we have B3 coming up, which B3 is the weekend of the 17th, I want to say.

210
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,320
God, I hope I'm not wrong. I'm not looking at a calendar, so forgive me if I messed up.

211
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,320
17th?

212
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,320
Isn't that right? Of May?

213
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,320
I hope not.

214
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,320
Why? What's that?

215
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,320
Because of E3?

216
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,320
Yeah, it's like right after E3. It's right after E3.

217
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,320
Is E3 the week before?

218
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,320
No, E3 is like Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and B3 is Saturday, Sunday.

219
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,320
Shit, I hope... God damn it, I'm gonna miss Matrix!

220
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,320
No! Can't have this!

221
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,320
We're trying to see who we have to blow to get B3 tickets, by the way.

222
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,320
E3. I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry, yeah. We don't have to worry about B3 tickets.

223
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,320
But if somebody there needs blown, whatever.

224
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,320
I'm sure people would mind getting blown for free.

225
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,320
We're trying to get tickets to E3 really, really badly.

226
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,000
Don't put that up in my mouth!

227
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,240
I was trying to make you practice.

228
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,640
Rob's trying to shove the microphone up my nose.

229
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,640
I don't have to really say anything because this thing picks up everything.

230
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:55,320
I'm holding the microphone across the room, and it's blinking.

231
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,320
Missy?

232
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,280
Rob's taking volunteers of people he can practice blowing.

233
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,280
No!

234
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,280
For E3.

235
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,280
No!

236
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,280
Not me.

237
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:09,280
Not me. That's why we have an intern.

238
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,280
Fuck you all.

239
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:20,280
I suppose we can talk about actual Bemani news tonight.

240
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:26,280
Alright, this is the one that's on everybody's mind and you know we have to bring this up, you guys.

241
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,280
The big, big news that comes out this week.

242
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:36,640
Electronics Boutique on their website is now taking pre-orders for Dance Dance Revolution

243
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,640
Xbox Mix.

244
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:44,720
This is Xbox, because you can't have an Xbox Mix, because that just sounds stupid.

245
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,720
What do you think of this DDR Xbox Mix?

246
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,400
Well, considering that it looks like it has characters again, obviously, so I'm wondering

247
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,120
if they're going to try to port the DDR PC version over to the Xbox, which I would like.

248
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,820
I'll read this story. This is the official story coming from GamingHorizon.com.

249
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,640
It was only a matter of time until we saw the popular Dance Dance Revolution franchise

250
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,560
scatter onto other consoles besides the PlayStation.

251
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,700
DDR first started in the arcades.

252
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,040
Electronic Boutique's website informs visitors of an upcoming DDR game from Konami entitled

253
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,760
Dance Dance Revolution Xbox.

254
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,800
The game is supposedly going to contain all new songs, exclusive tracks for North America,

255
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:30,800
Xbox Live integrations so gamers can download more songs, characters, and dance steps.

256
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,840
New game modes are also going to be implemented in that have never been seen before in other

257
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,420
DDR titles. Unfortunately, Economy of America hasn't sent out an official press release

258
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:45,800
yet concerning this recent news, but we can almost guarantee to see something during E3

259
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,320
in May.

260
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,420
Will we get stuck with another diet mode?

261
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:54,200
i think that this is it has as much a validity to it as uh... to yes you say

262
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,720
i don't know it's got picture

263
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,080
i can't i mean pictures are true great

264
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,000
they know is ever

265
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,520
take the picture of

266
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,200
i'm gonna dissent i think it's true

267
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,600
i i i really think this is true

268
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,260
because i just don't i don't see electronics boutique having that big a

269
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,800
balls

270
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:16,280
did you call me

271
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,140
you want to know what i think is absolutely stupid

272
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:23,420
DDRX or something, and so they call it Xbox.

273
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,340
As if it couldn't...

274
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,940
As if, where's the imagination there?

275
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,260
It could be a working title. Because it's only for the Xbox!

276
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,000
It's only for the Xbox!

277
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,300
And if you look at the box art, and I just posted a link in our chatroom

278
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,380
to this story,

279
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,820
it says, only for Xbox. But this is probably that fake art, you know how

280
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,540
sometimes the big gaming stores,

281
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:49,100
GameStop, EB, and all those. They do like the fake box art when they're doing it taking pre-orders?

282
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,300
I'm gonna go and draw

283
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,500
just DDR, Xbox, and put it up on the site and say this is the official art.

284
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,740
First of all,

285
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,940
it's DDR on a non-PlayStation system.

286
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,940
And I loved my Dreamcast ones, you know, they're great.

287
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,660
We can't make edits and take them with you.

288
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,580
And you can't use paint mode, I mean,

289
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,140
you know, paint

290
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:15,280
it was like the best thing about third mix

291
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,840
i think it's

292
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,400
a big pile of stinky dog poo

293
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,280
i guess we won't find out for sure till E3 but i don't know um...

294
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,000
i think

295
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,040
i think there's validity to it i just

296
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,600
it makes sense

297
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,520
microsoft's really straggling right now to get something that's going to be

298
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,060
successful for their system you get a really

299
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:38,200
popular kind of growing thing like DDR and there's going to be those

300
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,340
obsessive freaks that will buy an Xbox just for this mix.

301
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:45,220
I won't. I won't either, but there will be obsessive freaks that will.

302
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:51,500
Oh, I can't wait. I can't wait. I can't wait. Oh, wait. Oh, it sucks.

303
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:56,160
The Xbox is all about having Steel Battalion. So as the one person in this room who actually

304
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,700
owns an Xbox, Jamie, what games are worth playing on the Xbox?

305
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,340
The game of throwing the Xbox at children. Just Already a Future.

306
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,340
D.O.A. Beach Volleyball

307
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:12,340
There's nothing funnier than watching men

308
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,340
trying to accessorize a swimsuit

309
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,340
Fuck that, we're just trying to figure out how to take it off

310
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:24,340
D.O.A. 3 was good because I am a

311
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:28,340
fighting game heart

312
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:32,340
Fable, I'm looking forward to

313
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:39,380
club knockoff? Fable is an RPG where you start off with him as a child and you run through

314
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:45,140
this character's life and whatever decision that you make, like say you lose an eye, well

315
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:50,180
after a while the people might start calling you Winky or if you lose an arm you'll be

316
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:56,980
like Lefty or whatever. What if you are without arms and legs, what would they call you then?

317
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,560
target

318
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:04,160
but like um... they also have like if you you know kill um... like this whole

319
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,540
family and leave like a child alive

320
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,800
the child can make it their life's quest to kill you

321
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,420
or they'll be afraid of you or you know things like that it's like whatever

322
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:17,380
decision you make. So when your character goes and sexually molests other children and other families and then

323
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,040
they'll have issues later on in life

324
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,220
yes it would work that way

325
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,520
okay just checking

326
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,840
I don't know, I think it would be kind of neat, although I don't really like...

327
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:34,620
It's sort of like the typical American-looking art for RPGs and the like.

328
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,120
I don't really like how it looks.

329
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,200
But then again, I didn't like how Wind Waker looks in this neat game,

330
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,640
because, you know,

331
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,340
Link looks deformed and semi-retarded.

332
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:51,400
Because Link's in... Then again, it's not really Link, so it doesn't matter.

333
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,040
What game is this again?

334
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,440
win-waker

335
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,140
table

336
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,640
babu

337
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,320
japan

338
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,640
uh...

339
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,520
hill is pretty but it makes me throw up a lot of sucks act

340
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,400
hills hill so i think so

341
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,640
hill is not that bad it's good if you like a mindless

342
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,280
adventure shoot him up tight

343
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,120
where did you get them forever

344
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,320
Hello to the Ice Queen, by the way.

345
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,120
Oh yeah, hi.

346
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,620
No, I'm sorry, but Halo was alright, but I thought it got real repetitive after a while,

347
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:33,520
and Halo 2 is just gonna be just as bad, probably, except you can play it online supposedly, yes or no.

348
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,620
Who knows what they do anymore.

349
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,020
I want them to take the first Doom, and make it look really cool.

350
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:38,920
Yes.

351
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,620
Doom 3?

352
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,320
No, I don't want Doom 3. I want the first Doom done really cool.

353
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,120
I'm just waiting.

354
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,220
I want them to take Hexen, and not Hexen 2, I want Hexen.

355
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:59,900
I want them to do a sprite-based, first-person shooter collection, and I want it to work

356
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:06,140
with the Steel Battalion controller.

357
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:12,060
And I want them to have level editors so I can play Gachamon Quake.

358
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:15,140
They did a Gachamon skin for Quake.

359
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,540
I'm trying to figure out how to make a forest level for Counter Strike so I can have the

360
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,060
whole battle royale theme.

361
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,420
I have four characters made out of forty.

362
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,860
There's white cream on my shirt.

363
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,860
No comment!

364
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,860
No I would like to see...

365
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:33,540
All I'm waiting for is Return to Castle Wolfenstein on the PS2.

366
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,020
Why play it on PS2?

367
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:40,380
cuz i don't play on the computer soviet you can get all jagaty edges

368
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,720
and motion blur

369
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,880
most of my life jagaty edges in motion blur i'll have you know

370
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,740
you know everybody hates motion blur because of the bouncer it was nothing

371
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,100
but one big blur

372
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,200
or if there was a risk for people that there was to be

373
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,940
i wanted or tend to be a good day actually ended in have yet to play it

374
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,600
i wanted

375
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,600
Well, Dan got it for me because I'm a big Orphan fan. I love the anime.

376
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,600
I wasn't wondering about that, because I've played Orphan, the video game, and it was alright.

377
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,600
I mean, it was...

378
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,600
Well, I wouldn't say it completely sucked, just because I'm like...

379
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,600
I don't know. It was okay.

380
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,600
I slacked off on collecting the DVDs.

381
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,600
But is the DVD worth watching?

382
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,600
Oh God, the anime is awesome.

383
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,600
Really? Okay.

384
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,600
I've got like five laserdiscs of the second series, Orphan Revenge.

385
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,600
How many series are there?

386
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,600
Two.

387
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,600
And I think there's OAVs, I think.

388
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,600
Do they make the box sets?

389
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,600
That's...

390
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
Yes.

391
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,600
Yay!

392
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
Okay, now I have something to look forward to.

393
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,600
But, dude, well, Orphan's already...

394
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,480
I think the whole series should be out now, back on DVD, but I've only got the first three.

395
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,600
I totally slacked off on it, and I love Orphan.

396
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,860
Cool.

397
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:50,160
I've played stuff from, music from the series on one of my fuck-off shows before.

398
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,160
Buddha Me 2 is coming out, too.

399
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,160
Which one?

400
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,160
Buddha Me 2.

401
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,160
Oh.

402
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,160
This is...

403
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,160
Welcome to Anime Chat!

404
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,160
Hi.

405
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,160
EOSFBB says, remember Commander Keen?

406
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,160
That game was the shit.

407
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,160
That was the best game except there were like a million sequels and it got redundant.

408
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,160
Jazz the Jackrabbit.

409
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,160
No, I'm sorry.

410
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,160
Best Sonic ripoff ever.

411
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,160
Commander Keen 4 was like better than like Super Nintendo.

412
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,160
Leisure Suit Larry.

413
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,160
Anyway, back to DDR on Xbox.

414
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,160
Wait, it's all about the Crystal Caves.

415
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,160
Who in here remembers Phantasmagoria?

416
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,160
Okay.

417
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,160
A game I never got to play.

418
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,160
I know, I got to see the end of it.

419
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:34,520
of it but miss annoyed the hell out of me I have missed on Saturn I think I

420
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,800
still have the discs for phantasmagoria around here somewhere I'm gonna have to

421
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:49,000

422
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:57,760
access I have two patterns also one's modded we add two styles of Saturn's the

423
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,960
The only reason why Jamie always says, everybody who has this raise your hand, because she

424
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,360
has everything.

425
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,260
She will always win.

426
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,260
I don't have a Jaguar.

427
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,260
You don't have a game slave too.

428
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,680
You don't have a crappy Jaguar, good, save yourself.

429
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,920
I want a Jaguar for the version of Tempest 2000 on it.

430
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:20,360
Did you ever see Sean Baby's list of the 10 worst video games ever?

431
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,520
Like five of them are Jaguar games.

432
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,120
And then the others are the Zelda games on 3DO.

433
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:33,440
of them was it was a 3d or cdi i think the worst game was what gilligan's island or something

434
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,160
i don't know i'll pull up the list no the worst one the worst things ever is the version

435
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:43,840
of et that's on the atari 26 yes that's it that was it that was it it was the et on

436
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,200
their whole little rumor is that they had there's like 2300 cartridges buried out in

437
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:53,780
like mexico or something that is not a rumor it is it really and i would have buried it

438
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:58,920
forum for free. That was bad and I can't believe they're making another ET game like a million

439
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:03,020
years after ET came out and is done and gone. They're gonna make... No, they're gonna redo

440
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:08,020
them to take out the guns and put in cell phones. Return to the green planet or blue

441
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:13,060
planet or whatever. How about return to my butt? Okay. Let's... This is an... This is

Oh my gosh, I remember that.

451
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,700
My little cousin had that, and I like, threw the Game Boy halfway across the room.

452
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,700
That was the worst thing ever.

Number 19?

454
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:52,700

On the NES.

500
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,060
I don't remember Predator.

501
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,260
Oh, it was bad.

502
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,160
You couldn't even jump when you needed to.

503
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,160
You'd like jump on his own.

504
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,160
Do everything on his own.

505
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,160
Oh, my God.

506
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,880
Number 14, Rap Jam, volume one.

507
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,880
Oh, God.

508
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,540
My friend had this game.

509
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:40,540
You could play Queen Latifah versus Coolio, all in a big game of basketball.

510
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,660
Dude, I'd play as Queen Latifah.

511
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:46,780
And they say, it says here on Sean Baby's site, Queen Latifah looks like a 130-pound

512
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,180
Mexican boy.

513
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,540
Alright, next.

514
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,140
Number 13 was Air Cars for the Jaguar.

515
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,140
Um, no.

516
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,700
It looks like a piece of poo.

517
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,860
Number 12, I think Jamie owns this, Night Trap.

518
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,860
Yes.

519
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:03,420
I want the 32X one.

520
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:07,140
night trap started driving through state of play dole

521
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:11,300
start and i think it was me night trap was good it was like the first real

522
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,520
controversial game out there that night

523
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,900
chapel required intelligence to play it because you had to know

524
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,260
what you monitor your things and that we've actually been done and i think it

525
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,700
was a little like i really didn't know all this other stuff

526
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:28,220
i want a new version of maniac mansion yes

527
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:32,320
it says i always made the house exploded they have a medium as a cartoon

528
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,320
That was a live-action TV show.

529
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,320
I have the data tentacle, and that was funny.

530
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,320
Monster in My Pocket.

531
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,320
Yes.

532
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,320
Monster in My Pocket, before there was Pokemon.

533
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,320
Okay, we're going down Sean Baby's list of the 20 worst games of all time, except it's

534
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,320
a couple years old.

535
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,320
No!

536
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,320
It's Dragonlance!

537
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,320
Number 11 is Dragonlance, Heroes of the Lance.

538
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,320
I want that game.

539
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,320
I don't even remember this game.

540
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,320
Because I love the books.

541
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,320
I don't care if the game sucks.

542
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:05,320
It sucks. It makes a complete mockery of the books.

543
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,320
I had one of the Dragonlance PC games that came on the big ass floppy disks.

544
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,320
I've never seen the PC version. I've only seen that version and that... no.

545
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,320
Yeah, because I read all the Dragonlance...

546
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:21,320
Okay, this one I absolutely agree with, because the home versions, even down to the Saturn version,

547
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,320
suck so much ass, Revolution X.

548
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,320
Aerosmith, Stars in Revolution X.

549
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:39,320
That was only good in the arcade. I could get, I could pick which toilet stall he was in, and I could, because you have to watch, when you first start the game, the cat, the direction that the cat goes in is which way you have to pick the toilet. And then you get one of them.

550
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,320
And I would do the one in the warehouse too.

551
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:55,320
I just played it yesterday actually at Scandia. It was the best, but the Super Nintendo version was, I gotta say though, the Super NES version was better than the PC version. The PC version was worse.

552
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:02,320
Okay, number nine. Jamie, do you have this one? Custer's Revenge.

553
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,320
I have a ROM of this. Dan has a ROM of this.

554
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,320
Yeah, I think a lot of people have the ROM, but nobody has the actual cartridge that we know.

555
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:17,320
If you want to think of it, I may actually have, we have a ROM chip player for 2600, and I think we actually may have the ROM chip for this.

556
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:29,320
Now for those that don't know what Custer's Revenge is, the way it works is you play a Custer, and your job is to fuck this woman with a feather in her hat over and over again.

557
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,320
That's a dildo on her head.

558
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,320
Or it's a dildo on her head, I don't know.

559
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,320
I like that caption.

560
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,320
And you have to dodge the falling arrows.

561
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,320
I like the caption it says erotic imagery. I've masturbated to sexier Legos

562
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,960
Okay, dude x-man is not on this

563
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:48,720
What's x-man x-man was this one where you you play as this little he looks like scissors except

564
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,160
It's a guy with a big dick the size of his body

565
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,340
And you walk through a maze and then when you get to the center of the maze and avoid the traps

566
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,880
You like have to there's this woman on all fours and you have to bone her

567
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,640
number eight white men can't jump for the Jaguar

568
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,800
whoops there it is

569
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:13,280
I hate that game I haven't played it because I got flacked for my last name

570
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,960
because of that stupid movie

571
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,120
number seven superman 64

572
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:25,720
played it never got it I knew it had potential to be cool

573
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:32,720
6. Zelda, the Wand of Gamelon

574
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,720
This picture is about to give somebody head.

575
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,720
Dude, it's like, it's the designs from the costume series.

576
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,720
Oh, yeah, it's so good.

577
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,720
Well, excuse me, princess.

578
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,720
Why is Link being played by Prince?

579
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,720
That's all I want to know.

580
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,720
All right, number five.

581
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,720
He's not Link anymore, he's like, an ocarina is like what his symbol is.

582
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,720
A game for the 3DO called Virtuoso.

583
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,720
Virtuoso, oh my god, no.

584
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,720
Being played by, um...

585
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,720
A hairband guy.

586
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,720
It's Vince Neil.

587
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,720
It's a succeeded film.

588
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,720
4.

589
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,720
Captain Novolin.

590
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,720
No, what was it on?

591
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,720
It's a game about diabetes.

592
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:47,720
It was put together not to educate children about diabetes, but to blatantly taunt their

593
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,720
disease.

594
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:54,600
Okay, I've played better flash games than what this looks like.

595
00:38:54,600 --> 00:39:03,640
There's this flash game about sexually transmitted diseases, and you have to catch the jizz in

596
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,760
a condom.

597
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,680
This helpful nurse will come out and say, you need to check your blood sugar four times

598
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,520
a day, but you can check it more often if you like.

599
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,520
That's a helpful...

600
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,640
I don't want to stick a needle in my finger.

601
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,640
Here, let me do it 20 times a day.

602
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,640
No. Diabetes is nothing to joke about, but that's why this game is so bad.

603
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,640
I know it's not, but still, it's rather wrong.

604
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,640
That's why this game is bad.

605
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,640
Fight for life.

606
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,640
Number 3 is a game called Fight for Life from the Jaguar.

607
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,640
I think this game sucks.

608
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,640
Wow. It looks awful. Why is the sky green in there?

609
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,640
Wait a minute, that's one of my old nicknames.

610
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,640
Number 2 is...

611
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,640
Yes, Rob's old nickname is Why is the Sky Green Back There?

612
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,000
Number two is a game called Club Drive for the Jaguar.

613
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,480
It looks like, um, you remember Hard Drivin'?

614
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,480
Yes.

615
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,880
It looks like hard driving, like, but shittier.

616
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,800
Dude, I actually have a cool story about hard drivin'.

617
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,720
You know the deluxe one that had the chair that swung in and out and fell into the really

618
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,840
dark covered machine?

619
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,840
Mm-hmm.

620
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,960
Well, one time I was working at my arcade, and no one, I hadn't, didn't have any sleep

621
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:15,120
the night before, so I took a nap in one of those for four hours, and no one came in the

622
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,360
whole time

623
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,520
number one

624
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,120
as we mentioned earlier

625
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,160
the number one worst game of all time

626
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,340
e t the extra game and it's

627
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,120
all

628
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,920
pretty off me that

629
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,080
and and and and and the whole game

630
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:38,640
although i would actually and and and and and and and and and and and and and

631
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,560
with the e t sprite

632
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,860
and a big

633
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,920
anti

634
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,920
Don't be doggin' E.T.

635
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,920
Dude, I want a shirt with the dragon on it.

636
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,920
We should open up an Orange Lounge store that sells these things.

637
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,920
One of those crappy Cafe E-Press stores.

638
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,920
I've got one, too.

639
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,920
Well, let's just take a look.

640
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,920
All right.

641
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,920
I think what we're going to do at this point...

642
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:09,920
Did everybody get off their chest what they wanted to say about DDR on the Xbox and all?

643
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,920
I think that picked up on the mic.

644
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,280
quick question for you guys we're getting asked by the chat room about

645
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,120
this and I said yes because I know at least I'll be here next Sunday is Easter

646
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:26,520
are we still doing a show yeah anybody anybody have to celebrate Easter only if

647
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:31,560
I get to burn something I get Easter is really about the eggs who gives a crap

648
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:35,920
about this Jesus shit not going to be celebrating Easter we're gonna celebrate

649
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,920
Let's celebrate my birthday!

650
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:13,920
Oh, where did 420 come from? 420 is the police code. You know how there's all these police codes for different crimes? 420 is smoking marijuana.

651
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,920
I've got a 1337. I wonder what a 1337 is in police code.

652
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,920
I call a homestar runner break.

653
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:25,920
A homestar runner break? You want to do a homestar runner break? Did you bring some on your CD here?

654
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,920
And now more sounds of E.T.

655
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,920
In two weeks, however, we'll be taped.

656
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,920
Why are you sending me to Home Star Runner?

657
00:42:39,920 --> 00:43:00,920
I have no idea what Jamie's doing.

658
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,040
She just took over my computer and she's loading up stuff on her Star Runner.

659
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,320
On my computer, I have it loaded to where it'll start up.

660
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:11,320
Hello stupid and welcome to your crappy computer.

661
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,320
I want that.

662
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,320
I can send you the MP3 if you really want it.

663
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,320
Cool.

664
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:21,320
It's from, it's Strong Bad saying it so it's pretty cool.

665
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,320
Oh dear.

666
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:29,320
Loading, loading, loading.

667
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,320
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh.

668
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,320
I'm glad underscore v-mail dot v-x-e.

669
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,320
Answer.

670
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:40,320
Dear Strongback, why don't you and the Chief pull a caper of some sort?

671
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:44,320
It seems like there's been little cooperation between the two of you as of late.

672
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,320
James, Detroit mate.

673
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,320
Well, you're right.

674
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:54,320
It's no secret that the Chief and I haven't been getting along very well since he screwed up our last caper.

675
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:58,320
I don't care about the crosswords, man. Just the jumbles. The jumbles.

676
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,320
I don't know.

677
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,320
I don't know. Go look over there.

678
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,320
Look out!

679
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,320
Oh great man!

680
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,320
He's tall and sad.

681
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,320
Batman.

682
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,320
Who are you going to steal from my house?

683
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,320
We've been ID'd.

684
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,320
Every man for himself!

685
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,320
Thanks for stopping by you guys.

686
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,320
Thanks for breaking my cowlamp.

687
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,320
The cheat man.

688
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,320
Where did we go wrong?

689
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:33,320
Seems like just yesterday we were setting fire to Strong Sam's Underwears.

690
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,320
I was yesterday.

691
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,320
This one's for you.

692
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:39,320
I got mad at the cheat

693
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:45,320
For screwing up the jumbled paper

694
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,320
I hope I don't see his name in the paper

695
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:52,320
In the obituaries

696
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,320
His dad would mean he's dead

697
00:44:54,320 --> 00:45:00,860
I'm so glad to cheaters not dead, the cheaters not dead

698
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:08,740
I'm so glad to cheaters not dead, the cheaters not dead

699
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:17,380
I'm so glad to cheaters not, Just a clap, just a clap

700
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:18,880
I didn't know you had any rhythm.

701
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,380
Oh sure, I got tons of rhythm.

702
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:21,380
You got the clap.

703
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,880
Keep it rolling for me guys, keep it rolling.

704
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,880
The cheetah.

705
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,880
I just wanted to say that.

706
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,880
Uh huh.

707
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,880
Oh, I can't stay mad at you.

708
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,880
Oh, how about a little kick for old time's sake.

709
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,880
And I'll have these kids, man.

710
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,380
But I don't...

711
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,880
Who's that?

712
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,880
Whoa! Watch me now! I had you there!

713
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:52,880
Okay.

714
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,880
Dude, what the hell was that?

715
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,880
You guys are so cute!

716
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,880
I should probably get dressed or something.

717
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,880
What is it, like three in the afternoon?

718
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,880
Looking good, Homestar!

719
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:13,880
Yeah, what's the deal?

720
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,880
Here, I didn't know you had to shave.

721
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,880
Oh, I don't. It's Cinnamon.

722
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:51,880
for a long long time two weeks ago during March Madness we had the world

723
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:58,720
debut of Kyle Snyder's song I could never be Japanese and you guys tonight

724
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:08,000
here it is an opportunity to go poop so this is it this is it the world premiere

725
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,440
well the second second premiere I guess because we already did this once we're

726
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:21,440
This is a clip from March Madness of Kyle Snyder singing his new song, I Can Never Be Japanese. Enjoy, you guys.

727
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:29,440
I remember when I was young It would come every Saturday evening

728
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:36,440
I would watch some Japanese TV It never did get boring

729
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:44,440
It was all I cared about There was nothing else for me to do

730
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:51,440
Then I suddenly hit reality And a message came through

731
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:59,440
I could never be Japanese No matter what it would never be

732
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:05,440
Even though I never gave up hope I had to face reality

733
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:24,440
I thought it would all end there, but somehow I kept going on I'm so interested in Japanese culture and that is why I wrote this song

734
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:33,440
If it weren't for my brother, I wouldn't know much about your culture

735
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:39,440
I would be so ignorant, it would be pure torture

736
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:47,440
I'm sure there are others who are into Japanese culture too

737
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,240
I'm glad I'm not the only one

738
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:54,880
Otherwise I'd probably be a fool

739
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,040
I could never be Japanese

740
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:02,000
No matter what it would never be

741
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,480
Even though I never gave up hope

742
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:09,080
I had to face reality

743
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,640
I thought it would all end there

744
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,760
Yet somehow I kept going on

745
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,760
I'm so interested in Japanese culture

746
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:26,760
That is why I wrote this song

747
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,760
There was much I didn't know

748
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,760
That I learned as the time flew by

749
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:37,760
I was shocked about what I learned

750
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,760
I didn't know why

751
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,760
Then it started to come to me

752
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:51,760
Though I wasn't born in Japan, life would be too hard for me

753
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,760
It must be part of the Lord's plan

754
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,760
I could never be Japanese

755
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,760
No matter what it would never be

756
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:09,760
Even though I never gave up hope, I had to face reality

757
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:19,880
I thought it would all end there, but somehow I kept going on, I'm so interested in Japanese

758
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:27,280
culture, and that is why I wrote this song.

759
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:36,580
I could never be Japanese, no matter what it would never be, even though I never gave

760
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:40,580
I had to face reality

761
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:44,580
I thought it would all end there

762
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:48,580
Yet somehow I kept going on

763
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:52,580
I'm so interested in Japanese culture

764
00:50:52,580 --> 00:51:01,580
And that is why I wrote this song

765
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,580
This is fucked up

766
00:51:54,580 --> 00:52:00,080
Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is...

767
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,080
This is fucked up.

768
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,080
This is fucked up.

769
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:59,960
And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's

770
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:02,560
favorite perverse baumanni band, Erotic.

771
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,200
Do it all night.

772
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,720
Do it with me.

773
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,440
No, no, that was awful, bloody terrible.

774
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,440
Why don't you take vocal lessons? Kill your teacher!

775
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,440
In the heat of the night.

776
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,440
Oh god, I think my ears are bleeding.

777
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,440
I liked it.

778
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,440
Shut the bloody hell up, Paula. Next!

779
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:24,440
Oh, that was cool.

780
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:29,440
Do you even know why you're here? That was just bloody pathetic. Next!

781
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:34,440
Come on, baby. Come on, do it with me.

782
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:37,440
Yes, yes, that's it! We have a winner!

783
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,440
A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

784
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,240
while I was singing, and I'm trying not to laugh. My face is actually bright red.

785
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:14,920
He walks away, I drop the microphone, and burst it into laughter.

786
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:18,800
It was so bad. That's why he got interrupted the first time.

787
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,740
Alright, the studio's

788
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:27,120
just erupted into chaos because we just had arriving. We have Dark Child's in the house, yay!

789
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:31,440
D Child in the heezy pacheezy.

790
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:36,400
And also back there, DDR Hollie, say hello.

791
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,400
Hi everybody!

792
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,400
Look kids, we have a new mixing board, isn't it pretty?

793
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,400
Yes, knows how you do not hear, but...

794
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,400
Where's the mixing board?

795
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,400
Ow!

796
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,400
That's worse, I feel bad for the people at home.

797
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:50,400
Also in that break, if you enjoyed that fucked up mix of Schlagwerk...

798
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,400
Ooh, yummy, cookie.

799
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,400
If you enjoyed that fucked up mix of Schlagwerk, you can thank Loki for that.

800
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:59,400
That's the dark, uh, that's the Schlagwerk, Dark Sakura will fuck you up mix.

801
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,400
Everybody should fuck someone up for that last one.

802
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,400
Also Gamelan de Couple, which we're finally starting to get...

803
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:15,400
We're starting to get some feedback in the chatroom that you know what you guys? Maybe that's overplayed a little bit. Do you think so? Do you think that song is overplayed or what?

804
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,400
It's back all over again everybody!

805
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,400
I have never ever had one of these before. Do I push the marble in?

806
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,400
No. Did you take the plastic off?

807
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,400
I took the plastic thing off.

808
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,400
Well there should be a green thing in there.

809
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,400
Oh.

810
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:36,400
now it's not

811
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,600
oh yeah i'm getting a lesson you take your thingy off

812
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,400
yeah it's good

813
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,360
cool

814
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,920
yeah it's

815
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,580
they do

816
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:54,680
no i don't want to see that

817
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,680
What? I haven't thought of it for a season.

818
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,680
What is this?

819
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,680
Everybody use your imagination at home.

820
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,680
I stuck it in my mouth.

821
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:06,680
Or better not, don't use your imagination at home.

822
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:11,680
Rob just didn't want to get it on the floor.

823
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:15,680
You know I just had to lick that all up.

824
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,680
Better to let it shoot off in your mouth, right?

825
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:26,680
Oh my God, my friend Garrett, earlier this week he took me to, what's that Japanese store?

826
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,840
Oh, Toto's I think it's called?

827
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,220
I think that's what the place was called.

828
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:36,460
It's over on, and I apologize for those out of Sacramento who aren't going to get this,

829
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:41,700
it's on Fruit Ridge and, Fruit Ridge and what's the other after, Freeport and Fruit Ridge.

830
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:42,700
That's where it is.

831
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:43,700
That's like a mile away from my house.

832
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:44,700
Okay.

833
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:45,700
They have...

834
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:49,120
If you're not in a car, don't go throughout the area, you will die.

835
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,840
I'm done.

836
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:54,280
We went and we got that and there was a reason I was

837
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:54,760
telling this story.

838
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:58,640
Oh yes, he bought the explosive Hello Kitty drink.

839
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,520
And it's this drink and it has Hello Kitty on it.

840
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,920
And it tastes like, do you remember those fruit candies

841
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:07,000
Mamba from high school?

842
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,240
Mamba candies.

843
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:12,040
It tastes like a liquid version of Mamba candies.

844
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:15,440
But when you open it, it opens worse than a bottle of

845
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:15,840
champagne.

846
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:16,960
He has to point it away.

847
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,560
We open it in his backyard.

848
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:23,160
And when you open it, the plastic top flew 40 yards, and he didn't even shake it.

849
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,760
So that's why we call it the explosive Hello Kitty drink.

850
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:27,560
You should shake it.

851
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:31,160
Yo, watch this, pointy-handed bird.

852
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,880
Shake it and take it to RVGL.

853
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:34,600
Oh!

854
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:35,440
Oh my god!

855
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,800
That's a great idea. Who wants to take an exploding Hello Kitty drink to RVGL?

856
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,440
We can, like, shake it up, like... First of all, who wants to go to RVGL? Cricket noise.

857
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:49,200
you can hurt you know i think it's an rv g l

858
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:53,900
i dislike pick the crap out of some stupid little river kids

859
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:58,000
ideally funding for me to do it i'd be jealous to have people thrown out

860
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,400
which i do and that's one of these every time we go to another uh... he was

861
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,460
looking at me for a like him and he had else

862
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:06,160
now i do that can if i don't like people there

863
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,660
i haven't run out

864
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:10,480
and the people happen out of the people who are being disruptive and causing a

865
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,920
big thing anyway right

866
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,920
So, I have people throw it out all the time.

867
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:19,920
I'm eating.

868
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:23,920
You know, we kind of got it on a tangent.

869
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,420
We were talking about bimani news.

870
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:26,920
We had tons of it to cover.

871
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,920
And then I got my pillow back.

872
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:29,920
Kickass!

873
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:30,920
Everybody!

874
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:31,920
Everybody!

875
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:36,920
What do you want to talk about now then?

876
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:37,920
Sleepy time!

877
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,920
There's still plenty of bimani to talk about.

878
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:45,400
about something new? Sure. Let's talk about DDR Ultra Mix. I was about to say that. That

879
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:52,400
is the stupidest idea in the world. Why? It's DDR PC 2. No, it's Ultra Mix. Get it right.

880
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:58,880
It's Ultra Crack. I mean, ooh, what, are we going to have more lovely characters that

881
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:05,880
we're all going to drool all over? No. Trojan Man is the first unlocked, just so you know.

882
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:12,880
This is being leaked, by the way. Somebody had discovered this on the ratings board website.

883
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,880
There was this website that you go to to get the ratings.

884
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,880
How sad is it that people browse that site to look for new games that are coming out?

885
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:19,880
Huh?

886
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,880
Yeah, it worked.

887
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:32,880
This is something I brought up in the chat room a few nights ago when I mentioned this for no apparent reason.

888
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:39,880
It's like, probably about 85-90% of the Bimani community, probably worldwide, knows about

889
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:45,520
StepMania or knows about DWI. So it's like, why waste however much they're going to try

890
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:51,100
to charge you for this stupid-ass game and just go spend a few hours a day downloading

891
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:55,000
a bunch of songs and you'll be just fine? Or do you really want the most retarded characters

892
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
in the world?

893
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,960
Because it's all about the kick-ass characters and the possibility that there might be new

894
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:05,940
new stuff even though there will never be new stuff. Now, Jazz in the chat room makes

895
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:13,180
a good point. You can't judge it till you play it. Oh, okay. Sure. I'm going by track

896
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:19,200
record here. Well, I don't know. If I'm correct, I've heard that from plenty of people before

897
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:23,600
DDRPC came out. You know, oh, you can't judge it before you play it and then you play it

898
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,440
and they get mad at you for judging it

899
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:30,880
it sucked and they all suck

900
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,600
wait what am i sorry did you say i was a guy?

901
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,880
alright i heard that about anal sex one time but uh...

902
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:40,660
i'm not going to try it i'll judge it before i try it

903
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:45,000
you know we were doing really good with this show not going any type of porno way

904
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,720
and now all of a sudden ANAL SEX POP

905
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:54,720
the

906
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:59,000
the

907
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,680
the

908
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:06,300
house and i saw a seriously

909
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:09,240
the else has something they want to say about uh...

910
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,300
the role to mix

911
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:15,800
what new characters can we look forward to wonderful ideas will come out of

912
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,760
America come out with

913
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,200
ultra active

914
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,000
there's a list

915
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:26,000
will we get another paranoia

916
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,640
nope

917
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:29,240
did i'm so tired of her and i

918
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,360
may have one more time and i want to find someone

919
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,960
you know i don't think there are a lot of survival and i had

920
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,160
that was the only way

921
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,520
good one that in evolution

922
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:41,120
well marionette survivor max is so original to with it and if you think i

923
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:44,000
was led up

924
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,460
all rightly as far as i'm concerned

925
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:47,660
paranoid is done

926
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:49,360
now he needs to die

927
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:50,580
and

928
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:54,180
well though he died and there would be no songs for dvd art is every hour to

929
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:58,420
say but that may be good cool do all the music that we need to get me to cool

930
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:00,420
intact to do all the music

931
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:04,280
and talk at the

932
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,640
but no key

933
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:12,060
now he needs to go back and do more great music

934
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:14,660
it here you know that

935
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:16,660
and yet we need more young ok

936
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:17,740
uh...

937
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:19,260
but seriously though they were

938
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:20,860
what they need to do

939
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:24,360
didn't seem like everything with the action which is being lazy

940
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:27,460
but they're leading in the whole of my system they're lazy on the songs that

941
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:30,880
they put in there they're lazy on the soundtrack to be released

942
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,380
into the whole things like you know

943
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:37,860
i could have made this a good game but you know i just kinda want to sit down

944
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:39,780
and sleep

945
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:46,780
Here's something more fascinating than DDR, whatever that crap is, Ultimate Battle 22.

946
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:49,780
We went to extreme.

947
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:52,780
Meat eating Pucky is more amusing.

948
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:58,780
Here's the reason why I figured they didn't really care about how well they made extreme.

949
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:01,780
Because they know that they have the fan base, and they know that every-

950
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:04,780
That's wrong, I don't want to see that, thank you.

951
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:07,780
Anyways, they know that people are going to play a game no matter what.

952
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:10,780
For the record, Rob did something phallic.

953
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:48,780
Anyways, yeah, so Ultramix sucks ass, and I won't buy it, but I'll download it off of some site, I'm sure.

954
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:50,780
I have video game news.

955
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:51,780
Oh.

956
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:52,780
I got you something.

957
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:55,780
Hold on a minute. Jamie, everybody has an announcement.

958
01:04:55,780 --> 01:05:10,580
I have two announcements, and neither of them are related to Bivani, shock shock shock shock!

959
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:17,140
The first one is in a few weeks from now, in IRC, or possibly AIM if I'm feeling like

960
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:22,620
being, you know, nice to people who don't use IRC, I'm going to be running a battle

961
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:31,660
royale game stat-based like a tabletop game except on IRC and then I saw

962
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:36,820
something cool one of my friends online made me download something cool it was

963
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:41,980
the the teaser for Kingdom Hearts 2

964
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:51,340
it's it's really cool except there's all this like neat hardcore fighting and

965
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:58,020
It's like one of the people doing hardcore fighting, landing in cool poses while wearing lots of black is Mickey Mouse

966
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:03,440
So with all this hardcore fighting, is there any hardcore sex?

967
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:08,400
I don't want to know about that associated with Kingdom Hearts 2. Thank you very much

968
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:14,060
Yes, I do. You just do it with the Final Fantasy characters. You don't do with the Disney characters

969
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:31,260
this is the best fan art ever for anyone who remembers the race at the beginning of Kingdom

970
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:38,260
Kingdom Hearts. This is the best fanart ever.

971
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:44,060
What's the score now, Eric? Don't you agree?

972
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:49,060
Final Fuck X, yay! Kingdom Heart On.

973
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:56,060
I don't know, maybe that's the name of the doujinshi somewhere.

974
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:58,060
Kingdom hurts!

975
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:00,060
Kingdom hurts!

976
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:02,060
Oh my god.

977
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:04,060
This could like take up the whole show right here.

978
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:06,060
I'm fine with that.

979
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:08,060
RPG related

980
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:12,060
Like Secret of Mana, Secret of Flesh or something.

981
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:14,060
Welcome to the Temple of But.

982
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:16,060
Poking at Mana.

983
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:20,060
Ness151 in our chat room has an interesting motto for life.

984
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:24,060
When life gives you a lemon, toss it back and scream HENTAI!

985
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:26,060
Toss it back and scream, HENTAI!

986
01:07:54,060 --> 01:08:02,660
You know, my friend was telling me about this porn, about this lemon, but never mind.

987
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:06,180
When life gives me lemons, I poison the lemonade.

988
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:07,180
That's beautiful.

989
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:11,340
When life gives me lemons, I decide to talk about something else.

990
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:17,380
Okay, anyways, DDR Max 2 obviously is coming out in like two weeks, more information being

991
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:19,460
released by Konami.

992
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:24,060
Of course, we know we were, you know, assuming that there's going to be more stuff about

993
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:28,980
the being able to create Oni's and that is in there, that you can create your own Oni

994
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:29,980
courses.

995
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:30,980
So that's kind of cool.

996
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:34,060
Plus, as before, we were talking about previous songs from DDR Extreme which are going to

997
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:35,060
be in there.

998
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:43,700
Two confirmed songs from Konami right now are Level of Shine and Crash.

999
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:48,900
Stop it with the ninja cookie thingies, crackers.

1000
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:51,820
I am disappointed by this box of pokey.

1001
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:57,060
It does not have a special unit CD, but the words special unit are really funny.

1002
01:08:57,060 --> 01:09:00,700
I have a special unit.

1003
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:04,740
You and your special unit can go stand in the hall, sir.

1004
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:06,700
Will there be any good porno in the hall?

1005
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:10,380
Yeah, why don't you go see?

1006
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:13,540
Then I guess me and my special unit won't be working together today.

1007
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:16,700
Oh, there's a barcode.

1008
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:24,680
code I win a special unit CD I've been asked to play a movie that we got here

1009
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:28,280
in the chat room I don't know this might cause drops though so if this causes too

1010
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:31,200
many drops we're gonna have to cut we're gonna have to cut this segment but we'll

1011
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:34,940
try it because I have done movies on the show way back on episode number like

1012
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:38,300
three or something you remember that whole controversy I wasn't here I

1013
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:45,520
remember I remember ever the you know it's like a giant spaceship place oh

1014
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:47,520
Oh yeah, we did play that. You were here for that.

1015
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,520
We need to do that promo back in.

1016
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,520
We'll play that after the next break.

1017
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,520
Okay, but anyway, let's see if this will work.

1018
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:57,520
I don't know, we might have some dropouts, but we'll see if it works.

1019
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,520
Okay.

1020
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,520
Loading, loadingly.

1021
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,520
Here we go!

1022
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,520
Zelda, Duke Onkka is under attack by the evil forces of Ganon.

1023
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,520
I'm going to Gamelon to aid him.

1024
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,520
But father, what if something happens to you?

1025
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,520
I'll take the Triforce of Courage to protect me.

1026
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:19,520
If you don't hear from me in a month, send Link.

1027
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,520
Ampa!

1028
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:22,520
Don't worry, Zelda.

1029
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:26,520
The Triforce of Wisdom promises the king will safely return.

1030
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:29,520
Enough! My ship sails in the morning.

1031
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:32,520
I wonder what's for dinner?

1032
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:36,520
Oh boy! I'm so hungry, I could eat it off the rock!

1033
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:41,520
I'm so hungry, I could eat Zelda!

1034
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:48,520
he's Zelda. Shut up, you hippie!

1035
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:58,080
Dude, she's touching him erotically.

1036
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:00,080
Dude, Link is totally gay.

1037
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,080
Great, great.

1038
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,080
Wake up, Impa. We're going to Gamelon.

1039
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:08,080
Alright, dear. I'll get the Triforce of Wisdom.

1040
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:16,080
Beautiful. You wanna see another movie from that game?

1041
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,080
What's that Gamelon?

1042
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:18,080
Alright.

1043
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,080
One more.

1044
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:22,080
Since there's such a huge demand for it, let's see another movie.

1045
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:25,080
Rob, can you give me back those minutes of life you just wasted?

1046
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,080
No. In fact, I'm gonna take more.

1047
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:30,080
Gee, it sure is boring around here.

1048
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,080
My boy!

1049
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:32,080
Cuz I'm playing this game!

1050
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,080
I'm a true warrior strive for!

1051
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,080
I just wonder what Ganon's up to.

1052
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:36,080
He's wearing lipstick.

1053
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,080
No teeth.

1054
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:41,080
Your majesty, Ganon's up to the island of Koridai.

1055
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:42,080
Oh my god!

1056
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:44,080
A son of bin lion came to visit them!

1057
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:47,080
Hmm, how can we help?

1058
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:51,080
It is written, only Link can defeat Ganon.

1059
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:52,080
Great!

1060
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,080
I'll grab my stuff!

1061
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,080
There is no time.

1062
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,080
By Ganon we mean George Bush.

1063
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:03,520
enough how about a kiss for luck you've got to be kidding squatter that we are

1064
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:12,200

01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:22,000

1066
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:29,000

01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:37,980
are you violated one more quick one quick one

1068
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:46,700
oh i have to click play i forgot to click play

1069
01:12:46,700 --> 01:13:12,460
the game is not recognized as part of the Zelda universe.

1070
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:18,280
I don't know, did you play Majora's Mask?

1071
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:23,280
Yeah, Majora's Ass.

1072
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,460
Um...

1073
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:27,100
Yeah. So...

1074
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:30,560
Also in Bamani news this week, we can talk about this. This is big news.

1075
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,460
This has all the kids excited.

1076
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:34,140
2DX Night Style!

1077
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:37,940
Is location testing!

1078
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:45,140
I love the look on his face.

1079
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:50,020
Some of the songs that are going to be in 2DX9 style, I have to find the link to that

1080
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:52,460
page.

1081
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:53,460
They have it?

1082
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:56,340
I'm going, I'm trying that, but there was another, there was another site that also

1083
01:13:56,340 --> 01:14:00,500
had, there's a site, the Japanese site that had all the 8th style location tests that

1084
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,780
has it too, and I don't remember where that's at.

1085
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:10,780
I am two seconds behind Rob on Legend of Max.

1086
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:12,780
Since I could finally get back to the stage now.

1087
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:16,780
I don't remember where that one site was, the Japanese site.

1088
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:22,780
It's not coming up.

1089
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:23,780
Snore.

1090
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:25,780
Thank you, somebody gave me a good link.

1091
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:28,780
Thank you, Arcadian42, you gave me a good link here.

1092
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:31,780
That's the one I was looking for.

1093
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:03,780
They're going through the whole solar system.

1094
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:05,780
That'll be beautiful.

1095
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:08,780
Sampling Masters Aya, Sampling Masters Mega, both of them.

1096
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:09,780
Emotion 2003.

1097
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:13,780
Emotion 2003, which is EOS remixed by Taka.

1098
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:17,780
But I thought Taka did the Emotion remix that's in Core.

1099
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:18,780
BeatMania Core.

1100
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:20,780
Well, that was also called Romantic.

1101
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:22,780
So it might be the same damn song, for all we know.

1102
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:25,780
No, it's Emotion 2003. Get it right.

1103
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:30,780
Good Cool, featuring Andrea L. Hopkins, called Your Body.

1104
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:34,780
You got a grooved, extended joy style.

1105
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:37,780
A new Naoki Underground song called Prelude.

1106
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:41,780
Akira Yamaka with a song that's in Japanese.

1107
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:47,780
I think it's called Body, or that's the genre's body.

1108
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:50,780
Lion something.

1109
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:53,780
Lion something.

1110
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:57,780
No new Orange Lounge song in 2DX9 style, which is kinda spooky.

1111
01:15:57,780 --> 01:16:06,780
This is the Heavens remix by Ryu, the guy that won the remix contest back then who did Starmine.

1112
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:10,780
I believe he has a new song in this also.

1113
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:13,780
Ryu has a new song? I didn't see that listed.

1114
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:18,780
I thought. I looked the list really quickly.

1115
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:24,080
chat rooms, kind of making some observations, like there's a lot of collaborations. Oh,

1116
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:31,360
Arcadians got it. It's Lion Suki. That's it. No new Orange Lounge song listed as of yet,

1117
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:35,480
but if I remember right with eight styles test, the Orange Lounge song didn't show up

1118
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:41,200
until after, it didn't show up till later. I want Pocky.

1119
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:47,040
There was also two different ones. There's sampling masters Aya and I guess Aya, whatever,

1120
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:22,560
Okay, here we go. There's some screenshots of night style right there. Again, it's very

1121
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:27,840
blue and orange. It's got like the space station theme here. It's kind of interesting. But

1122
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:32,980
look at this. What do these look like?

1123
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:33,980
Looks like e-cards.

1124
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:35,600
They look like e-cards.

1125
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:44,100
Because they say E on the bottom. That's the whole... Okay, how much you want to bet? Okay,

1126
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:45,100
I'm going to...

1127
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:51,660
here first there will be e-cards for Extreme 2. Oh for the new DDR whatever it is? Oh I'll bet you

1128
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:58,540
I bet you there will be in fact it will get rid of the whole memory card thing. It seems to be the

1129
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:04,860
way where Konami is going between Guitar Freaks and Pop Music. I have this feeling that they're

1130
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:09,500
going to bring out some type of reader to use with your PlayStation 2 or whatever that reads

1131
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:14,900
those cards you know another system they tried to do that with the Neo Geo where

1132
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:19,980
the old MBS units you could take a card and put it on your Neo Geo system at home

1133
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:24,020
I've got I've actually got the Neo Geo with the slots open on it I just haven't

1134
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:30,880
found a machine with working MBS slots all of our slots are wide open you said

1135
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:43,700
it not mean well isn't that special I think now is a good time for us to take

1136
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:46,860
a quick break and we're gonna come back and do the F use of the week we have to

1137
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:51,740
play that one promo one promo oh yes right we'll play that when we come back

1138
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:56,140
so if you want to send it in over private message right now the F use of

1139
01:18:56,140 --> 01:19:00,520
the week you can send them over p.m. to me in the chat room hi I'm sky and to

1140
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:06,060
To get to our chat room, just go to callebomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, then click on Chat.

1141
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:08,800
It's just that simple.

1142
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:09,940
We'll take a quick break.

1143
01:19:09,940 --> 01:19:15,760
We're going to start it off with something from 8 style.

1144
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:21,440
We're going to play some tack.

1145
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:24,520
I only have the long mix of abstracts, is that cool?

1146
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:25,520
You want to hear A?

1147
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,160
Okay, we're going to play some A songs.

1148
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:36,160
We're gonna play abstract, the radical mix, and then we'll play A, and then we'll be right back with the FUs of the week, so send those over private message right now to me.

1149
01:23:57,160 --> 01:24:02,160
...

1150
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:07,160
...

1151
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:12,160
...

1152
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:17,160
...

1153
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:22,160
...

1154
01:26:52,160 --> 01:27:02,360
Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of

1155
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:04,640
the Orange Dance Baymara Music and More show?

1156
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:12,160
The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

1157
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:14,380
It's unearthly.

1158
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:22,140
It's like being in a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

1159
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:28,140
That sounds like a guy who must have been part of Heaven's Gate or something, talking about going to spaceships and shit.

1160
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:32,140
We're having fun opening Ramune.

1161
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:34,140
I don't have a...

1162
01:27:34,140 --> 01:27:36,140
Ra-moo-nay.

1163
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:38,140
Ra-moo-nay.

1164
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:40,140
Ramune.

1165
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:42,140
Ramune.

1166
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:44,140
Even if there's a Ramune named Ramune.

1167
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:46,140
Rob's a hick.

1168
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:48,140
Honky.

1169
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:50,140
Okay.

1170
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:54,140
Alright kids, shall we do the FUs of the Week now?

1171
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:57,140
No, because Jamie has to go watch her guys.

1172
01:27:57,140 --> 01:27:59,140
Dark Child 1 didn't know where that promo was from.

1173
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:02,140
That was that little clip where the guys talk about Dancing on Spaces.

1174
01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:04,140
That's from a movie. Do you remember the name of the movie?

1175
01:28:04,140 --> 01:28:08,140
Somebody entered it into some San Francisco film festival.

1176
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:14,140
It was in San Francisco. It was somewhere back east, like Rhode Island or some crap like that.

1177
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:15,140
Delaware, I don't know.

1178
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:22,140
Anyways, it was on the KOA site. Um, I don't know where it's at right now, but yeah.

1179
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:26,140
Okay, um...

1180
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:29,140
Alright.

1181
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:32,140
Okay. Are we ready for the interviews of the week now?

1182
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:34,140
No, I heard... Okay, really quickly, this needs to be really quick.

1183
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:35,140
Sure. Sure.

1184
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:38,140
Um, oh, and, and watch, watch, watch the board.

1185
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:41,140
Hey! It's a board!

1186
01:28:41,140 --> 01:28:48,980
I heard something about there was a rumor going around about karaoke karaoke revolution

1187
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:55,940
yeah that's also listed on EB's site if I'm not mistaken it was either on EB's site or

1188
01:28:55,940 --> 01:29:04,920
the yeah so now there was that there was that E3 press release that came out a couple weeks

1189
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:09,300
ago that started all these rumors because it said Konami will have you dancing and playing

1190
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:15,420
outdoors and singing in 2003. And that kind of made people go, what does that mean? And

1191
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:18,300
as far as I thought, I figured that meant that they were probably just going to bring

1192
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:22,140
karaoke mode back into DDR. You remember in third mix, you'd have the lyrics on the screen?

1193
01:29:22,140 --> 01:29:30,140
So you two could sit at home and go, oh, Nick, please, not so quick. You know I want it big.

1194
01:29:30,140 --> 01:29:35,220
That would be cool to come back, though. And then I believe there was a DDR machine

1195
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:38,340
that also had karaoke in it, if I'm not mistaking.

1196
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:41,620
Akuma GM says something like that. Very rare. Yeah, they're very rare.

1197
01:29:41,620 --> 01:29:45,140
But I think there was, there was a separate machine.

1198
01:29:45,140 --> 01:29:48,620
But then there was also, wasn't there a standalone? Okay, you were thinking about that.

1199
01:29:48,620 --> 01:29:52,340
I was thinking you were talking about the standalone karaoke game. Like the one they have at CyberZone?

1200
01:29:52,340 --> 01:29:56,420
Should I go to CyberZone? No, I've never been to CyberZone.

1201
01:29:56,420 --> 01:30:01,420
But you may have heard about it.

1202
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:05,020
Okay, like I like karaoke. You're pretending that I care about karaoke?

1203
01:30:05,020 --> 01:30:07,020
I think you just don't admit it.

1204
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:12,020
I just think it'd be awesome for a segment, okay? That's all I'm saying.

1205
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:13,020
Blink.

1206
01:30:14,020 --> 01:30:18,020
Karaoke is Japanese for tone deaf.

1207
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:24,020
Can we do the fuckies of the week now?

1208
01:30:24,020 --> 01:30:25,020
Yeah.

1209
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:26,020
go.

1210
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:27,020
Okay.

1211
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:28,020
Here is justice.

1212
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:29,020
Here is punishment.

1213
01:30:29,020 --> 01:30:30,020
Here is...

1214
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:31,020
Okay.

1215
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:49,780
My five year week goes toward onedollarhosting.com for having morons for techs who don't know

1216
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:54,780
I know that when I say moving to new server, that does mean moving to new host as well.

1217
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:57,780
If I say I'm moving to a server, you know what that means, right?

1218
01:30:57,780 --> 01:31:00,780
Okay, everybody knows what moving to a new server means.

1219
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:02,780
Apparently the techs at One Dollar Hosting do not.

1220
01:31:02,780 --> 01:31:06,780
So they're big morons built stupid heads.

1221
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:09,780
They're monkeys that fling poo at each other.

1222
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:12,780
Okay?

1223
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:13,780
And that's a lie.

1224
01:31:13,780 --> 01:31:14,780
Okay, I'm sorry.

1225
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:15,780
That's a lie too.

1226
01:31:15,780 --> 01:31:17,780
It's not really one dollar because you have to pay a membership fee.

1227
01:31:17,780 --> 01:31:24,780
paying one dollar a month.

1228
01:31:47,780 --> 01:31:51,780
I'm done. My angst is somewhat worn off.

1229
01:32:17,780 --> 01:32:24,740
on may 15th and not last friday and the fact that um um you suck

1230
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:30,740
yeah warner brothers they suck ass there's one more reason why i hated them but i can't remember

1231
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:37,460
what it is offhand yeah because they smell and um let's see there's also a big f-view for um

1232
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:47,460
Stupid people of Scandinavia, because that's so generic, and stupid spammers, and...

1233
01:32:47,460 --> 01:32:49,460
Damn it, I...

1234
01:32:49,460 --> 01:32:51,460
Bammers, you jackass!

1235
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:55,460
Spaniards, what fucking problem is...

1236
01:32:55,460 --> 01:32:56,460
Ugh.

1237
01:32:56,460 --> 01:32:58,460
Oh, let's see.

1238
01:32:58,460 --> 01:33:05,460
Oh, oh, oh, and also to the core, because that movie sucked ass and should have never been made, and it was a waste of time for anyone that went there.

1239
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:07,460
In fact, that movie probably slurred your soul, so, um...

1240
01:33:07,460 --> 01:33:08,460
Then why did you go?

1241
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:09,460
I didn't go.

1242
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:10,460
Oh.

1243
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:11,460
Hahahaha!

1244
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:12,460
Haha!

1245
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:17,460
Yes, I didn't go, but I can still base it on that.

1246
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:18,460
Um...

1247
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:23,460
Um, also a big eff you to New Line for releasing, uh, Kangaroo.

1248
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:24,460
Or, that stupid kangaroo.

1249
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:25,460
Kangaroo Jack.

1250
01:33:25,460 --> 01:33:26,460
Captain Jack.

1251
01:33:26,460 --> 01:33:30,460
See, now, that would be more entertaining if it was Captain Jack running around in the,

1252
01:33:30,460 --> 01:33:32,460
you know, the Outback, and, you know, two or three people shooting at him.

1253
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:35,460
Well, if it was Captain Jack, there would have been a wet t-shirt contest in there.

1254
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:06,460
I want to go see the movie! Now!

1255
01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:08,460
It will be there when you get back.

1256
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:10,460
E3 is not going to be there.

1257
01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:12,460
It will be all over the internet.

1258
01:34:12,460 --> 01:34:14,460
I don't want to see the movie opening day!

1259
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:15,460
You can see it down in L.A.

1260
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:17,460
I want to see it opening day! I already bought tickets!

1261
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:18,460
You can see it?

1262
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:21,460
Why would you want to go there opening day with all those stupid geeky guys dressed up like Neo?

1263
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:24,460
Because he is one of those geeky guys who dresses like Neo!

1264
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:28,460
I set that one up for you perfectly, Dara.

1265
01:34:28,460 --> 01:34:30,460
You're welcome.

1266
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:32,460
The glasses and the trench coat still sue me.

1267
01:34:32,460 --> 01:34:35,460
Did you see his dynamite rave routine at Scat?

1268
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:36,460
Did you see it?

1269
01:34:36,460 --> 01:34:39,460
You have all two seconds of it.

1270
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:40,460
Yeah.

1271
01:34:40,460 --> 01:34:42,460
I don't really have that much this week.

1272
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:46,460
I was pissed off during the week and then I just slowly cooled off.

1273
01:34:46,460 --> 01:34:47,460
I hate that.

1274
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:50,460
See, fuck off shows will be awesome when we move because

1275
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:59,460
I'll be able to spout off my dislike for society on a daily basis.

1276
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:14,460
kostjamrh My f-view of the week goes out to Pokemon Ruby, because ever since I bought that game, I can't stop playing it, and I feel really immature. But you know what, it's fun.

1277
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:16,460
How many Pokemon are in that one?

1278
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:18,460
Like, about 200. It's a lot.

1279
01:35:18,460 --> 01:35:20,460
Really quickly, this will only take a second.

1280
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:29,460
FU to the press, because they don't realize that all these Iraqi children that are killed in the street are probably from all the gunshots that people are firing in celebration of the fact that the regime is over.

1281
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:32,460
They don't realize that bullets go up and then they come down.

1282
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:34,460
Why are all my children dead? I do not know!

1283
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:41,460
so

1284
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:43,380
right

1285
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:47,380
I'm they fire off a gun and there's birds falling everywhere

1286
01:35:47,380 --> 01:35:51,300
squirrels little Iraqis suicide bombing squirrels

1287
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:55,380
you know I came up with a good idea for your Pokemon thing is if like they had

1288
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:56,460
like a fighting game

1289
01:35:56,460 --> 01:35:59,700
where the Pokemon actually had to fight each other. Pokemon stadium!

1290
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:03,220
no like to the death and like there would be three to

1291
01:36:03,220 --> 01:36:10,220
There'd be like different, yes, there'd be like different classes. There'd be adults, and then little ones, and then some of them have their stages.

1292
01:36:10,220 --> 01:36:20,220
Yeah, yeah, like, you know how you have like Pikachu becomes Rayachu, and that's all they have, but then there's ones where it's like Squirtle, and then I forget what he changes up to that, and then he becomes Blastoise?

1293
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:23,220
Yeah, Wartortle.

1294
01:36:23,220 --> 01:36:31,220
Anyways, there's one more thing really quickly. They're releasing a live version of Battle Angel.

1295
01:36:31,220 --> 01:36:36,220
Battle Angel. Remember the cybernetic chick that fights people and shit? A live action version.

1296
01:36:36,220 --> 01:36:40,220
Are they basing it off of a comic? Yes. Because the comic strolled.

1297
01:36:40,220 --> 01:36:47,220
Alright, I didn't really have any FUs of the Week outside of that, so I guess I'm done. Let's go around the room and hear from everyone else.

1298
01:36:47,220 --> 01:36:50,220
Zero.

1299
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:54,620
Okay, I actually have a couple, not a whole lot, and this is the worst music to choose.

1300
01:36:54,620 --> 01:36:55,520
What a feeling!

1301
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:57,920
Anyways, no, um, okay.

1302
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:00,420
One of them I realized at Arden Fair Mall.

1303
01:37:00,420 --> 01:37:04,220
To the stupid bastards who can't wash their hands after they go to the bathroom.

1304
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:07,820
I don't want to touch the fucking door handle after you touched it.

1305
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:10,420
I don't want your lemon juice all over my hands.

1306
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:11,620
Um...

1307
01:37:11,620 --> 01:37:13,420
After the stup-

1308
01:37:13,420 --> 01:37:16,120
I don't give a shit what it is, it's fucking gross.

1309
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:18,820
And then, like...

1310
01:37:18,820 --> 01:37:26,700
No, and then the next thing is, for the people who made those stupid hand dryers, make them

1311
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:30,860
warmer or something because make them actually fucking work.

1312
01:37:30,860 --> 01:37:34,460
You're not reading the directions, it says rub your hands together.

1313
01:37:34,460 --> 01:37:35,460
It works.

1314
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:36,460
Trust me.

1315
01:37:36,460 --> 01:37:37,460
No, you know what those hand dryers are for?

1316
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:38,460
No, I know.

1317
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:39,460
You have those in the men's restroom.

1318
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:40,460
In the men's restroom.

1319
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:41,460
You want to know why?

1320
01:37:41,460 --> 01:37:43,520
So they don't have to restock paper towels for us.

1321
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:44,520
Women have paper towels.

1322
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:47,660
They also have nice mirrors, nice toilets, everything's clean.

1323
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:54,660
is

1324
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:59,160
it's not like you're in in this one of the dumbest people in the universe

1325
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:03,080
and i water everywhere

1326
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:06,240
and like another f you don't go through the whole thing

1327
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:08,380
used to die quickly

1328
01:38:08,380 --> 01:38:10,900
is it's gone way too long

1329
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:15,740
followed by uh... you have a stupid lately because that's not to and you do

1330
01:38:15,740 --> 01:38:17,740
Yeah, bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

1331
01:38:17,740 --> 01:38:21,740
Magic cards were cool, like, I don't know, ten years ago, or whenever they came out.

1332
01:38:21,740 --> 01:38:23,740
And, um, exactly!

1333
01:38:23,740 --> 01:38:25,740
It's not pretty, Hashi, the old cartoons!

1334
01:38:25,740 --> 01:38:26,740
They weren't good, they-

1335
01:38:26,740 --> 01:38:27,740
Oh, ooh!

1336
01:38:27,740 --> 01:38:29,740
Oh, I mentioned this later. Never mind, that's alright, that's fine.

1337
01:38:29,740 --> 01:38:32,740
Oh, one more thing, uh, F.U. the Konami for not releasing the VR stream,

1338
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:34,740
because I'm starting to get bored with the VR stream.

1339
01:38:34,740 --> 01:38:36,740
I have another F.U.

1340
01:38:36,740 --> 01:38:38,740
I'm getting bored.

1341
01:38:38,740 --> 01:38:42,740
My other F.U. of the week goes toward not having money, because there's certain things that I need.

1342
01:38:42,740 --> 01:38:46,740
I need a tablet, a graphics tablet for my computer.

1343
01:38:46,740 --> 01:38:50,740
I need a light table to use for my art.

1344
01:38:50,740 --> 01:38:53,740
I cannot find...

1345
01:38:53,740 --> 01:38:56,740
Where do I get non-photo blue pencils?

1346
01:38:56,740 --> 01:38:58,740
I need non-photo blue pencils.

1347
01:38:58,740 --> 01:39:01,740
I know where you can get money for that stuff.

1348
01:39:01,740 --> 01:39:04,740
Put it on a wish list.

1349
01:39:04,740 --> 01:39:06,740
What?

1350
01:39:06,740 --> 01:39:09,740
You should do what those people do on the internet, like the ones who say,

1351
01:39:09,740 --> 01:39:14,500
my bills and people send them like five bucks just tell people help me help me

1356
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:38,800

1357
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:45,240
a proper drafting table and illumination because once I scan in all the stuff that I've drawn,

1358
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:50,160
I see all this crap that I missed because I don't have the proper light to do any of

1359
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:53,760
it. So yeah, fuck not having a drafting table with a built-in light.

1360
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:59,720
F you to not having money, okay? I have to get a fucking costume ready for the damn convention

1361
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:02,160
and I have no money. We're going thrift store shopping.

1362
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:05,760
I know, I found out the perfect idea for the number two is to-

1363
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:13,760
I figured it out. Actually, he helped me figure it out later. Anyways, I'm done with my F.U. because, just, fuck that.

1364
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:19,760
No! Some of us other people have fuck-yous too.

1365
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:21,760
Okay, fuck you then.

1366
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,760
No, don't fuck both of us. Anyway.

1367
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:30,760
Okay, come on, continue. Is Anita up next? I'm sorry.

1368
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:33,760
Okay, alright, I'll go next. Um, mine's not very long.

1369
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:39,760
Okay, first of all, fuck you to Roosevelt Golf Land for getting rid of the Para-Para-Para machine.

1370
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:42,760
I'm highly disappointed, now I have to- Huh?

1371
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:48,760
Yeah, fuck them in general, but fuck them especially, most especially because they got rid of Para-Para-Para.

1372
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:51,760
Now I have to go very, very far away to play Para-Para-Para.

1373
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:54,760
You should get the PS2 version.

1374
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:59,760
I don't have room, but I could try.

1375
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:03,760
It's not the same.

1376
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:08,760
Hey, it's fine. You can be even stupider in your own house instead of out in the shade with a bunch of people.

1377
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:13,760
Okay. Well, this leads into my next Fuck You of the Week, which is

1378
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:18,760
Fuck You to Milpitas Golf Land, because they have

1379
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:25,260
Okay, just Disney Disney mix that stupid Disney DDR. I hate that game because

1380
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:29,020
Because you can't see the damn arrows and when you start messing up

1381
01:41:29,020 --> 01:41:34,860
They start to flicker and you can't tell what the hell you're doing. Plus Milpitas has like big-ass fan in front of you

1382
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:40,500
So you feel like you're in a tornado while you're trying to play DDR. It really sucks. I can't breathe

1383
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:44,660
I can't see so I fail every time and also

1384
01:41:44,660 --> 01:41:51,660
Oh, I had one more from Milpitas. I forgot what it was. Oh, what's that place we went

1385
01:41:55,380 --> 01:42:01,020

That will teach you the pirate software, little boy.

1411
01:43:36,260 --> 01:43:39,260
You haven't come out for the PC yet.

Yeah, you tell that.

1413
01:43:40,260 --> 01:43:42,260
But there are, like, release betas out there.

1414
01:43:42,260 --> 01:43:45,260
Ah, that's what you get for trying to get that.

1415
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:49,260
See, I had the same thing where I tried to get Lord of the Rings 2, and I got Sorority

1416
01:43:49,260 --> 01:43:50,260
Boys.

1417
01:43:50,260 --> 01:43:53,260
I got Sorority Boys all the goddamn time.

1418
01:43:53,260 --> 01:43:55,260
Sorority Boys was, like, everywhere for a while.

1419
01:43:55,260 --> 01:43:57,260
Like, any movie you downloaded was Sorority Boys.

1420
01:43:57,260 --> 01:44:02,260
we're going to have an evil time once battle layout 2 is out

1421
01:44:02,260 --> 01:44:06,260

some, it wasn't porn but it was like some kiddie game

1424
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:15,260
it was like Mavis Beacon 2003 or something

1425
01:44:15,260 --> 01:44:18,260
as if, Mavis Beacon's the shit, I'm sorry

1426
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:19,260
as if it's a little

1427
01:44:19,260 --> 01:44:21,260
that's how I learned to type

1428
01:44:21,260 --> 01:44:25,260
I already know how to type, I learned how to type from playing on IRC

1429
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:26,260
on Mavis Beacon.

1430
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:27,260
Yeah!

01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:28,260
You're gay, dude.

1432
01:44:28,260 --> 01:44:37,820
If you didn't get that, Zero says Mavis Beacon is the city where the 50-pound black woman.

1433
01:44:37,820 --> 01:44:38,820
Is she really?

1434
01:44:38,820 --> 01:44:40,700
Mavis Beacon is the Oprah of computers.

1435
01:44:40,700 --> 01:44:45,100
Oprah's not 250 pounds.

1436
01:44:45,100 --> 01:44:46,100
She was.

1437
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:47,100
Maybe her breasts are.

1438
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:49,140
You know what's really, really, really scary?

1439
01:44:49,140 --> 01:44:51,140
She's gonna be posing nude.

1440
01:44:51,140 --> 01:44:52,140
No.

1441
01:44:52,140 --> 01:44:53,140
No.

1442
01:44:53,140 --> 01:44:54,140
Yes, serious.

1443
01:44:54,140 --> 01:44:55,140

1447
01:45:16,940 --> 01:45:21,100
don't want dr. Phil jacking off to her magazine Oprah needs to gain 200 pounds

1448
01:45:21,100 --> 01:45:28,100

01:45:28,220 --> 01:45:35,220
people

1450
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:40,820
that people lose personality when they lose weight they lose IQ too

1451
01:45:40,820 --> 01:45:43,120
they turn into hoes and lose IQ

1452
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:46,460
let's get through the last two people FUs in here please

1453
01:45:46,460 --> 01:45:49,040
okay my FU time

1454
01:45:49,040 --> 01:46:00,040
Fuck you, Anthony for kickin' my ass in Street Fighter II.

1455
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:03,040
That's the only fuck you I can think of because things have turned around.

1456
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:05,040
I can't really say fuck you to anything.

1457
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:07,040
I'm not pissed off anymore.

1458
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:10,040
Fuck you for me not being pissed off no more.

1459
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:12,040
Fuck all of you.

1460
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:18,040
Okay, uh, I have two fuck yous. One is to Zelda, the Wind Waker, okay?

1461
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:20,040
It's an awesome thing.

1462
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:24,040
Or you don't need to fuck you for having Zelda. I don't even have it. I can't get it because they're out of stock everywhere, I guess.

1463
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:27,040
Fuck you for telling him to fuck off because he has Zelda.

1464
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:38,040
Yeah. Anyway, fuck you to Zelda, because the story was so incredibly cool. I won't spoil the ending for any of you, but if you play it, you'll know what I mean, I think.

1465
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:40,040
Link wins.

1466
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:43,200
link does not win

1467
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:46,800
like i said i'm not spoiling it for anybody

1468
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:51,440
so fuck you to zelda because you'll see what i mean when you play it

1469
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:53,240
yeah and the fact that link looks like a monster

1470
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:59,000
and especially fuck you to that little kid with the booger hanging out his nose on your home island

1471
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,640
my second fuck you is fuck you to the world for not giving me anything to

1472
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:04,160
complain about this week except zelda i mean my god

1473
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:08,040
i'm actually happy this week and that's not okay

1474
01:47:08,040 --> 01:47:09,820
fuck you to this week

1475
01:47:09,820 --> 01:47:15,820
Because it seems like everyone who normally has lots of fuck yous has lame fuck yous because they're too goddamn fucking happy.

1476
01:47:16,820 --> 01:47:18,820
Yeah, Jamie's were cool, though.

1477
01:47:18,820 --> 01:47:20,820
Alright, let's see what the chat room has to say.

1478
01:47:20,820 --> 01:47:22,820
Let's get into the chat room.

1479
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:24,820
No, we're going to do the chat room fuck yous now. Here we go.

1480
01:47:24,820 --> 01:47:33,820
USFBB would like to say, um, fuck you to whoever decided that POWs are heroes. What the fuck? If you're a prisoner of war, that means you fucked up.

1481
01:47:33,820 --> 01:47:46,820
That was more politically incorrect than anything Loki's ever said.

1482
01:47:46,820 --> 01:47:48,820
Who said that fuck you?

1483
01:47:48,820 --> 01:47:49,820
Who said that fuck you?

1484
01:47:49,820 --> 01:47:51,820
What's the screen name? Who said that fuck you?

1485
01:47:51,820 --> 01:47:52,820
P.O.S. F.B.B.

1486
01:47:52,820 --> 01:47:55,820
U.S. F.B.B.?

1487
01:47:55,820 --> 01:47:57,820
Alright, well what the fuck is that?

1488
01:47:57,820 --> 01:48:01,820
Fuck you. P.O.W.s are fucking the shit.

1489
01:48:01,820 --> 01:48:05,720

1490
01:48:05,720 --> 01:48:08,920

You barely know who are friend of friends who don't leave you the fuck alone all night like they own you

1503
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:08,360
It was so bad in fact that I had to ponder using the I'm gay approach to get her the fuck away from me

1504
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:14,420
You know I just have to say this over air. What do you mean Jamie? You have a little bit of drool right side?

1505
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:17,560

1512
01:49:48,140 --> 01:49:50,780
Who needs free web space try my server in my friend's closet

01:49:54,260 --> 01:49:58,820

1516
01:50:10,580 --> 01:50:18,540
This is going to be Jamie being a bitch, and please forgive me for being a bitch.

1517
01:50:18,540 --> 01:50:19,540
Get over it!

1518
01:50:19,540 --> 01:50:23,020
Just go out there and do it, and stop being sorry for yourself.

1519
01:50:23,020 --> 01:50:24,020
Yeah, you know what?

1520
01:50:24,020 --> 01:50:25,020
That brings me to a fuck you I can remember.

1521
01:50:25,020 --> 01:50:26,020
I'm going to say it now.

1522
01:50:26,020 --> 01:50:27,740
I'm going to just jump in on these chat room ones.

1523
01:50:27,740 --> 01:50:28,740
Fuck you, Vaj.

1524
01:50:28,740 --> 01:50:30,860
Vaj, come on, man!

1525
01:50:30,860 --> 01:50:32,340

01:50:32,340 --> 01:50:35,420
Archaholic go up and pimp a chick for you.

1527
01:50:35,420 --> 01:50:36,980
Get some fucking balls, man!

1528
01:50:36,980 --> 01:50:38,380
It's just a girl!

1529
01:50:38,380 --> 01:50:39,540
Hey, hey, hey!

1530
01:50:39,540 --> 01:50:43,540
best advice ever. If you want to talk to women, go to a fucking strip club because they're

1531
01:50:43,540 --> 01:50:48,260
forced to come talk to you. They will carry on a conversation for long hours and you don't

1532
01:50:48,260 --> 01:50:52,020
have to pay them shit. They'll just come talk to you and then after you get done with the

1533
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:56,540
conversation, they'll be like, do you want a lap desk? No. See, it's perfect. You only

1534
01:50:56,540 --> 01:51:01,220
spend an initial $20 to get in, but talking to strippers is awesome and you'll just totally

1535
01:51:01,220 --> 01:51:05,700
get over the whole fact that you're intimidated by women because they're really hot. Or you

1536
01:51:05,700 --> 01:51:10,700
Maybe we can go to a hospital to ER where people are stuck there laying in their hospital beds and can't get away.

1537
01:51:10,700 --> 01:51:15,700
Oh my god.

1538
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:20,700
It's because when you're talking to hot, retarded women, it's not very intimidating.

1539
01:51:20,700 --> 01:51:25,700
When you're talking to hot, intelligent women, that's why I'm intimidated.

1540
01:51:25,700 --> 01:51:30,700
You must be going the city limits, man, because fucking me, dude.

1541
01:51:30,700 --> 01:51:37,700

1542
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:41,860

Also, fuck you to this thing, and he gives a couple flash things that I'm not gonna look at right now.

1552
01:52:04,820 --> 01:52:10,320
Uh, fuck you to the people who made those for not giving out any warnings to people who have heart problems.

1553
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:14,920
I don't personally, but those could either A, kill fat people, or B, scare the holy living shit out of kids.

1554
01:52:14,920 --> 01:52:17,620
Maybe some people, not even kids. I mean, those are just kind of fucked up.

1555
01:52:17,620 --> 01:52:21,620
There's some fucked up flashes that I'm not looking at right now.

1556
01:52:21,620 --> 01:52:24,920
Angel, I would like to say F you to whatever sickness everyone is getting,

1557
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:27,420
because I caught a bit of it too earlier in the week.

1558
01:52:27,420 --> 01:52:30,520
F you to Magus being away, and yeah, I'm better now.

1559
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:33,520
By the way, I haven't gotten sick yet, just letting everyone know.

1560
01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:12,520
The point is, it's not SARS because I know a lot of people who have gotten sick and they all got better within about three or four days.

1561
01:53:12,520 --> 01:53:17,520
Fuck you for being way too serious. God damn, it was a fucking joke.

1562
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:24,520
Well, it's because my better half is very sick right now and it would suck if that was SARS, okay? It wouldn't be a funny laughing matter.

1563
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:29,520
Yeah, I should've done that. I haven't been to Hong Kong in a while, but I got better.

1564
01:53:54,520 --> 01:53:56,520
Fuck, flat-faced on it, I have no idea.

1565
01:54:00,520 --> 01:54:04,520
Okay, SkylineDC505 says, F you to hormones, nuff said.

1566
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:05,520
Mm-hmm.

1567
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:06,520
Indeed.

1568
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:11,520
Shadow would like to say, right now the only F you I have right now, uh, the...

1569
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:14,520
I hate not being able to find a nice, quiet place with my girlfriend.

1570
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:18,520
Fuck people for being around to nose around and spoil the mood.

1571
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:21,520
That's how you go to your house.

1572
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:40,640
vidpower would like to say FU to my computer for not booting up Windows XP correctly, FU

1573
01:54:40,640 --> 01:54:44,000
to my monitor being all screwy whenever I turn on my computer, and FU to turning in

1574
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,080
homework during Spring Break.

1575
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:50,080
All right, FUs are over, yay.

1576
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:55,800
Now would be an excellent time.

1577
01:54:55,800 --> 01:55:04,880
I think now we're going to talk about the Orange Lounge cage match, yay.

1578
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:15,200
Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, quite a controversy breaks out over

1579
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:20,720
the song that won, which was a band called Freeze Pop, with a song called Science Genius

1580
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:24,280
Girl, and that was the song they did in frequency.

1581
01:55:24,280 --> 01:55:26,280
And Zero and T.A.W.

1582
01:55:26,280 --> 01:55:31,960
and S.H.I.V.E.M. got into it, and I made them hug when it was all over.

1583
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:34,080
Did you like that, Rob?

1584
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:39,160
turned me on little bit of man-on-man action I wrote in no I did not join in

1585
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:43,200
okay as for that whole little argument we got in we were actually talking in

1586
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:47,760
IRC and I admitted that yeah I do like some free spot song but I actually

1587
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:53,960
can't stand that and we made up and we're friends again ah you made out your

1590
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:06,080
For three songs, you can vote for the song that won last week or one of the two new songs.

1591
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:11,080
And this winning song goes into rotation on Orange Lounge Radio, Spelvani Museum, or forum.

1592
01:56:11,080 --> 01:56:16,280
Alright, here we go, last week's winner, here's a clip, Freeze Pop, Science Genius Girl, here

1593
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:17,280
on Orange Lounge Radio.

1594
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:24,280
The theorems stick to me, Microscope is in my hand

1595
01:56:24,280 --> 01:56:29,280
Fun, fun, fun, sweet, fun, in the street

1596
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:35,280
When I call the human being, It will walk to all my hands

1597
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:43,280
When I call the human being, It will be a member of my band

1598
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:47,280
It will be a member of my band

1599
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:51,280
It will be a member of my band

1600
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:55,280
When I go to do my wishing

1601
01:56:55,280 --> 01:56:58,280
Remember what my name is

1602
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:50,840
I'm sorry we were out just then we had dead air just there I had the stuff muted because

1603
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:53,840
people were talking over that last one you're gonna have to introduce the song again real

1604
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:54,840
Sorry about that.

1605
01:57:54,840 --> 01:57:55,840
Okay.

1606
01:57:55,840 --> 01:58:00,840
Let me run the title through one more time, because I need to give actually the name of

1607
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:01,840
the mix.

1608
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:03,840
It's M&M mixed by DJ Tripp.

1609
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:05,840
It's Without Me, Darktide, The Force mix.

1610
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:07,840
And where did you find this?

1611
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:12,840
Well, he brought the CD with it over to my house and I ripped it.

1612
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:18,840
DJ Tripp is one of my fiance's good friends, and he's a DJ in Santa Cruz.

1613
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:25,840
And apparently, it's just been played on a quad locally before, on the DJ David X show.

1614
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:30,840
And usually, we don't care for Eminem, but this is a remix.

1615
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:37,840
Alright, here we go. This is Eminem mixed by DJ Tripp with Without Me.

1616
01:59:00,840 --> 01:59:05,840
Two thread-apart girls go round the outside, round the outside, round the outside

1617
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:10,840
Guess who's back?

1618
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:12,840
Back again

1619
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:14,840
Shave his back

1620
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:16,840
She'll look free

1621
01:59:17,840 --> 01:59:18,840
Guess who's back?

1622
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:20,840
Guess who's back?

1623
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:22,840
Guess who's back?

1624
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:24,840
Guess who's back?

1625
01:59:24,840 --> 01:59:38,920
I created a monster, cause nobody wants to see Marcel no more, they want Jadie, I'm

1626
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:39,920
stop living.

1627
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:41,920
Well if you want Jadie, this is what I'll get ya.

1628
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:44,960
A little bit of weed, mixin' some hearts, they got some thoughts, da-da-da-dum, start

1629
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:48,440
my heart, quicker than the shots, when I get shocked at the hospital, while the doctor

1630
01:59:48,440 --> 01:59:52,440
when they're not cooperating, when I'm rockin' at table, while he's operating.

1631
01:59:52,440 --> 01:59:54,240
You waited too long to stop debating

1632
01:59:54,240 --> 01:59:56,440
Cause I'm back, I'm on the brag, and I'm ovulating

1633
01:59:56,440 --> 01:59:58,440
I know that you got a job, Miss Janie

1634
01:59:58,440 --> 02:00:00,440
But your husband's heart problem's complicating

1635
02:00:00,440 --> 02:00:02,440
So the FCC won't let me be

1636
02:00:02,440 --> 02:00:04,440
Or let me be me, so let me see

1637
02:00:04,440 --> 02:00:06,440
They try to shut me down on MTV

1638
02:00:06,440 --> 02:00:09,440
But it feels so instant without me, so

1639
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:11,440
Come on, shit, I'm on your list

1640
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:12,440
Fuck that, come on your list

1641
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:14,440
Put someone to taste and get ready

1642
02:00:14,440 --> 02:00:15,440
Cause this shit's about to get heavy

1643
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:16,440
I just settled on my lawsuit

1644
02:00:16,440 --> 02:00:17,440
Fuck you, damn, yeah

1645
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:19,440
This looks like a job to me

1646
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:21,440
So everybody just follow me

1647
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:23,440
Just follow me, cause we need a little, cause of mercy

1648
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:25,440
Cause it feels so empty, without me

1649
02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:27,440
I say, this looks like a job for me

1650
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:29,440
So everybody, just follow me

1651
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:31,440
Cause we need a little, cause of mercy

1652
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:33,440
Cause it feels so empty, without me

1653
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:35,440
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious

1654
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:37,440
Embarrassed, the parents still listen to Elvis

1655
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:39,440
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless

1656
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:41,440
Till someone comes along on a mission and yells BITCH!

1657
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:43,440
A visionary, vision is scary

1658
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:45,440
Can start a revolution, balloon the airwaves

1659
02:00:45,440 --> 02:00:47,440
A rebel, but just let me revel in that

1660
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:49,440
And the fact that I got everyone

1661
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:52,440
And the fact that I got every one kiss I'm a dastard, it's a disaster

1662
02:00:52,440 --> 02:00:55,440
Such a catastrophe, but you receive so damn much of my ass

1663
02:00:55,440 --> 02:00:58,440
You ask for me, well I'm back, nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

1664
02:00:58,440 --> 02:01:00,440
Bitch, you better send it to me, nah nah nah nah nah nah

1665
02:01:00,440 --> 02:01:02,440
I'm gonna enter in and out front of your skin like a splinter

1666
02:01:02,440 --> 02:01:05,440
The center of attention, back for the winner, I'm in a resting

1667
02:01:05,440 --> 02:01:07,440
The best thing since wrestling, investing

1668
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:10,440
In your kid's ears and nesting, testing and templates

1669
02:01:10,440 --> 02:01:12,440
Still attention, soon as someone mentions me

1670
02:01:12,440 --> 02:01:14,440
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free

1671
02:01:14,440 --> 02:01:17,440
And who sent, who sent, you sent for me?

1672
02:01:47,440 --> 02:01:49,940
You don't know me, it's too old, let's go, it's over

1673
02:01:49,940 --> 02:01:52,440
Nobody listen to techno, no, let's go

1674
02:01:52,440 --> 02:01:54,440
Just give me the signal, I'll be there with a hole

1675
02:01:54,440 --> 02:01:56,440
It's still a new impulse, I've been don't

1676
02:01:56,440 --> 02:02:00,440
Suspenseful with a pistol, ever since Prince sent himself into assembly

1677
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:04,440
But sometimes, as it just seems, everybody only wants to discuss me

1678
02:02:04,440 --> 02:02:06,440
So this must mean I'm disgusting

1679
02:02:06,440 --> 02:02:08,440
But it's just me, I'm just a scene

1680
02:02:08,440 --> 02:02:10,440
So I'm not the first king of controversy

1681
02:02:10,440 --> 02:02:12,440
I am the worst thing from hell, expressly

1682
02:02:12,440 --> 02:02:14,940
To do black music, I'm self-evident

1683
02:02:14,940 --> 02:02:17,680
Use it to get myself wealthy Hey!

1684
02:02:17,720 --> 02:02:21,220
It's a concept that works 20 million of the white rappers emerged

1685
02:02:21,240 --> 02:02:25,320
No matter how many fits in the sea It'd be so easy without me

1686
02:02:25,340 --> 02:02:29,680
Now this looks like a job for me So everybody, just follow me

1687
02:02:29,720 --> 02:02:33,820
Cause we need a little controversy Cause it feels so easy without me

1688
02:02:33,860 --> 02:02:36,160
I said This looks like a job for me

1689
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:40,360
So everybody, just follow me Cause we need a little controversy

1690
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:42,460
Cause it's been so easy without me

1691
02:02:42,460 --> 02:03:12,420
Alright, that was M&M Remix.

1692
02:03:12,420 --> 02:03:16,240
by DJ Tripp, a song called Without Me. Now we go around the room and see what everyone

1693
02:03:16,240 --> 02:03:17,240
Some thoughts, Jamie?

1694
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:25,240
I personally, I mean, I more or less really like it, just because he's a cool guy, you

1695
02:03:25,240 --> 02:03:26,240
know, fan friend.

1696
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:33,240
Um, that, I look at the overall presentation, because if you think about it, a lot of what,

1697
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:37,240
you know, rap that you hear nowadays is just, you know, more of the same specific surface.

1698
02:03:37,240 --> 02:03:43,240
I think it's kind of neat to hear it done a little differently, and I like how it flows

1699
02:03:43,240 --> 02:03:44,240
together.

1700
02:03:44,240 --> 02:03:49,240
You know, I give it a 9 per play.

1701
02:03:50,240 --> 02:03:51,240
Alright, 0.

1702
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:57,240
Actually, I am really not an M&M fan at all.

1703
02:03:57,240 --> 02:04:00,240
Everybody who knows me knows I absolutely hate them.

1704
02:04:00,240 --> 02:04:07,240
But I've actually seen DJ Trip one time in Underground and I thought it was really good and everything only gets better from this song.

1705
02:04:07,240 --> 02:04:13,240
On this song, based alone, I give it an 8 because it was done pretty well.

1706
02:04:13,240 --> 02:04:15,240
Moving on, Loki.

1707
02:04:43,240 --> 02:04:48,240
Even some of the most simplest stuff works, but I'm going to have to give it like a 7.

1708
02:04:50,240 --> 02:04:52,240
Did you get a Holocaust?

1709
02:04:52,240 --> 02:04:59,240
Hey, yeah. I'm going to give it like a pretty decent score. It sounded really cool.

1710
02:04:59,240 --> 02:05:05,240
Put together well, as far as I can tell, but I really don't know that much about putting those things together.

1711
02:05:05,240 --> 02:05:10,240
But if Lucky says it wasn't that difficult at all, I believe that too.

1712
02:05:10,240 --> 02:05:15,680
What I really like about it is that it put visions in my head of Darth Vader doing hip-hop

1713
02:05:15,680 --> 02:05:22,680
dancing with the Stormtroopers behind him, and titled like DJ Vader, and then the big

1714
02:05:23,120 --> 02:05:28,360
titty girls in the back with the Princess Leia hair going, oh yeah baby, DJ Vader, Hoochie

1715
02:05:28,360 --> 02:05:35,360
Mama Girls, and the Stormtroopers featuring DJ Jazzy, Emperor, Jeff, and all that kind

1716
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:41,360
and you know all that kind of stuff. And then the octopus headed race doing it. I haven't

1717
02:05:41,360 --> 02:05:48,120
seen the part two yet. But um. Blue nose guy. The guy with the blue nose plan descended

1718
02:05:48,120 --> 02:05:54,960
doing scratching in the background. Oh the band from Jabba the Hutt or yeah. Yeah the

1719
02:05:54,960 --> 02:06:01,960
blue nose guy. He looked like an elephant thing. Yeah so you know it could have maybe

1720
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:05,960
I've maybe done a little bit more with it, added some stuff to it, but it was pretty neat, I liked it.

1721
02:06:05,960 --> 02:06:07,960
Call it an 8. Give it an 8.

1722
02:06:35,960 --> 02:06:36,840
overall

1723
02:06:36,840 --> 02:06:38,380
that you want to make a right

1724
02:06:38,380 --> 02:06:41,960
yes it's wrong to make a right yes

1725
02:06:41,960 --> 02:06:47,780
three let's do

1726
02:06:47,780 --> 02:06:49,080
all right

1727
02:06:49,080 --> 02:06:53,040
three left that's what we have to say on eminem mixed by d j trip without me now

1728
02:06:53,040 --> 02:06:55,760
loki what we hear last

1729
02:06:55,760 --> 02:06:57,400
today here's song by

1730
02:06:57,400 --> 02:06:59,960
group called haven't heard

1731
02:06:59,960 --> 02:07:02,780
i was introduced to the song by uh...

1732
02:07:02,780 --> 02:07:05,120
our friend eric tonight

1733
02:07:05,120 --> 02:07:09,320
And it's called Duck Toy, and you'll see why.

1734
02:07:09,320 --> 02:07:10,720
I'm very scared, but here it is.

1735
02:07:10,720 --> 02:07:12,800
This is Hampenberg with Duck Toy.

1736
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:19,800
Enjoy!

1737
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:19,800
Oh you bastard I want it, I want it

1738
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:26,800
I need it, I need it Oh yeah, yeah

1739
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:34,800
I want it, I want it I need it, I need it

1740
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:38,800
Oh yeah, yeah

1741
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:40,800
I want it

1742
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:57,440
It gave me a headache, I mean it was cool, it was really neat, but it gave me a headache.

1743
02:10:57,440 --> 02:11:03,560
And then it was like, when that woman started talking and making moaning noises, my response

1744
02:11:03,560 --> 02:11:11,560
This was Meanwhile in another song, so yeah, it gets a 7, but it still gave me a headache.

1745
02:11:11,560 --> 02:11:12,560
Hi.

1746
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:17,560
Zero.

1747
02:11:17,560 --> 02:11:31,560
Okay, as we all stare at the bondage for it, I don't know, okay, the beginning of that song sounded like a bad bowel movement, and then it moved into making me laugh my ass off once the rubber ducky started going.

1748
02:11:31,560 --> 02:11:38,560
And then all of a sudden it just switched songs and started going into a chick, starting off with something that sounded like, you bastard.

1749
02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:48,560
Um, altogether, that song really confused me and it might as well have had the smell of the sound it started with. I would give it like, a pour.

1750
02:11:48,560 --> 02:12:04,560
It was hilarious. The first time I listened to it, it was hilarious. I don't know where that shit came from, but I think that was an edit for the same song, and I think it's longer, and I think it starts out with the chick, and then it goes into the duck, and so that would make more sense.

1751
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:10,560
But if it is funny, and I was just thinking when I heard it, I was like, what an ingenious idea.

1752
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:16,560
I wonder who was out there thinking, I wonder if I can make a song with this duck.

1753
02:12:16,560 --> 02:12:22,560
I'll make a techno song with this rubber ducky. I mean, it's just, it was funny.

1754
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:24,560
DDRholic?

1755
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:28,560
I thought it was really funny too. That's a killer, killer duck.

1756
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:34,560
What kind of people was really a duck? It sounds like a dog toy to me, but it could be a dog toy, duck, whatever.

1757
02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:42,560
The thing, I don't understand the girl thing either, but it's genius what they did with the duck.

1758
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:53,560
It's genius the way it mixed, it raps, it did, you know, it's scratching, and it sounded like it had an orgasm too, but that's okay.

1759
02:12:53,560 --> 02:12:56,560
So I don't know, it's pretty good, I'll give it an eight.

1760
02:12:56,560 --> 02:13:02,560
That song brought to mind erotic imagery of Bert and Ernie, and for that it gets a 6.9.

1761
02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:06,560
6.9? What does that mean?

1762
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:08,560
Alright.

1763
02:13:08,560 --> 02:13:11,560
That means it's gettin' some.

1764
02:13:11,560 --> 02:13:15,560
You can send in your votes now, and here are the three songs you can vote for in tonight's cage match.

1765
02:13:15,560 --> 02:13:18,560
Last week's winner, Freeze Pop, was Science Genius Girl.

1766
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:25,560
I want to roll my hands, when I call my name.

1767
02:13:25,560 --> 02:13:39,560
This is Eminem mixed by DJ Tripp with Without Me.

1768
02:13:39,560 --> 02:13:50,560
And Hamburg with Duct Toy.

1769
02:13:50,560 --> 02:13:55,300
alright uh... you can vote for either one of those three songs right now

1770

1772
02:14:02,500 --> 02:14:07,100
and uh... some folks in the chat room saying all three songs suck this week

1773
02:14:07,100 --> 02:14:10,700
and they're not voting

1774
02:14:10,700 --> 02:14:15,060
you'd be damn glad i was gonna play the Kyle Snyder song again okay

1775
02:14:15,060 --> 02:14:17,500
that's right you know what i said last week

1776
02:14:17,500 --> 02:14:20,920
if i didn't if i i wasn't planning on winning that last week i don't think i

1777
02:14:20,920 --> 02:14:22,220
was going to win with that

1778
02:14:22,220 --> 02:14:24,940
and i said i was going to play the house and i don't know i a m

1779
02:14:24,940 --> 02:14:26,700
to vote

1780
02:14:26,700 --> 02:14:28,860
or i will be angry with you

1781
02:14:28,860 --> 02:14:30,780
uh...

1782
02:14:30,780 --> 02:14:34,520
and you don't want me to be angry with you

1783
02:14:34,520 --> 02:14:35,820
uh... right

1784
02:14:35,820 --> 02:14:37,300
uh...

1785
02:14:37,300 --> 02:14:40,300
we're going to take well i don't i don't really want to take a break so we need

1786
02:14:40,300 --> 02:14:42,780
to talk about something else uh... what's that was a

1787
02:14:42,780 --> 02:14:43,820
Can I break something?

1788
02:14:43,820 --> 02:14:45,460
Okay.

1789
02:14:45,460 --> 02:14:48,140
I don't have anything to break. I can't break the bottle lid again.

1790
02:14:48,140 --> 02:14:50,860
Zero, do you want to talk about video games? Do you have a review you want to give us?

1791
02:14:50,860 --> 02:14:57,020
Oh, okay. I can try to throw something together here. I wasn't fully prepared, but

1792
02:14:57,020 --> 02:15:01,940
Kingdom Hearts 2 does actually sound decent. I can't wait to at least see like a

1793
02:15:01,940 --> 02:15:05,660
good demo of it.

1794
02:15:05,660 --> 02:15:07,140
Oh, finished Kingdom Hearts?

1795
02:15:07,140 --> 02:15:10,780
Okay, I'm almost done. I just beat Agrabah, but I've been playing the getaway lately,

1796
02:15:10,780 --> 02:15:15,780
Which is on my review list, even though it's not really a new game.

1797
02:15:15,780 --> 02:15:20,780
I don't know, the gameplay of that game is cool, it's kind of sketchy sometimes.

1798
02:15:20,780 --> 02:15:26,780
All the model of the character models is really good, until they start moving.

1799
02:15:26,780 --> 02:15:31,780
When they start moving, it looks like a bad epileptic seizure or something.

1800
02:15:31,780 --> 02:15:39,780
Sometimes it's really smooth, and the other times they start doing the whole classic PS1 movies where it's all really blocky and jittery.

1801
02:15:39,780 --> 02:15:46,780
The gameplay is good, the story is good, involving, nor have I ever heard a game use the word fuck so many times in ten minutes.

1802
02:15:46,780 --> 02:15:52,780
And so it's fucking this, fucking this, fucking that, and it's all in an English accent, so either way you'll get to laugh pretty well.

1803
02:15:52,780 --> 02:15:55,780
Yeah, they get away.

1804
02:15:55,780 --> 02:16:03,780
Some of the mission objectives are kind of hard to understand, but you can't understand what the fuck they're telling you to do.

1805
02:16:03,780 --> 02:16:06,780
It's because you're not speaking English English.

1806
02:16:06,780 --> 02:16:14,780
I talked to my friend in the UK and they said, and I was talking to him and he's all, I can't understand you so I want you to speak English, I said I am, you're not.

1807
02:16:14,780 --> 02:16:23,780
Anyways, another game is, oh yeah, a big one right now, Auto Modelista. I have a couple, did you just say Auto Molesta?

1808
02:16:23,780 --> 02:16:29,780
That's basically what, basically that's what Auto Modelista does to your wallet.

1809
02:16:29,780 --> 02:16:52,780
Basically, you pay $50 for a game that looks really good, but the game is basically nothing but drifting. You get a 3000GT, which is supposed to have one of the best handling capabilities ever, and it's a constant drift. You touch the joystick and your car goes into a spin. It's kind of pointless.

1810
02:16:52,780 --> 02:16:57,780
That means to be good at it, you don't play it.

1811
02:17:22,780 --> 02:17:27,720
It's kind of a hit-or-miss thing after the Xbox. I really don't have anything up my sleeve right now

1812
02:17:27,720 --> 02:17:29,720
I haven't had a chance to play anything

1813
02:17:30,140 --> 02:17:33,220
But Oh save up $200 get steel battalion

1814
02:17:34,340 --> 02:17:36,340
$200 mine just played at your house

1815
02:17:37,660 --> 02:17:40,220
Steel battalion will make anyone feel manly

1816
02:17:41,080 --> 02:17:45,860
When you sit in front of this gigantic controller, it makes you feel like you have the world's biggest penis

1817
02:17:45,860 --> 02:17:50,860
As Brad comes in and demonstrates!

1818
02:18:15,860 --> 02:18:30,860
Let's see. Metroid Prime, still play it, even if you haven't. That's about it for right now until I start playing more. Now that I have a job, I'll be able to actually play more games, but I've got to go over to your house and play games at your house because you have a bunch.

1819
02:18:30,860 --> 02:18:36,860
And then more of you need to play Phantasy Star Online with me and Rob.

1820
02:18:36,860 --> 02:18:40,860
Yes, and I need to get my broadband adapter thing back.

1821
02:18:40,860 --> 02:18:45,860
And I'll be able to play it as Rob's character when we move in.

1822
02:18:45,860 --> 02:18:50,860
Yeah, you can put up to four characters on one card.

1823
02:18:50,860 --> 02:18:55,860
My character for Phantasy Star Online looks like she's twelve and has these big pink pigtails.

1824
02:18:55,860 --> 02:19:00,860
Well, bless you.

1825
02:19:00,860 --> 02:19:05,860
I thought you were going to say big pink boobs, sorry.

1826
02:19:05,860 --> 02:19:17,860
Next week I have a few games that I'm going to get a hold of and play and see what they do, so next week we do it again. I'm going to have a lot better of a review.

1827
02:19:17,860 --> 02:19:19,860
still play clock tower 3

1828
02:19:47,860 --> 02:19:52,860
Every movie where they have dolls, they're always the biggest killers.

1829
02:19:53,860 --> 02:19:57,860
So, yeah, I can't wait. I'm going to have a doll.

1830
02:19:58,860 --> 02:20:01,860
It's going to be the Loki doll. It's going to be a monkey.

1831
02:20:02,860 --> 02:20:04,860
They're like, monkey, kill him.

1832
02:20:05,860 --> 02:20:16,860
Once again, I'd like to remind our listeners that probably in about a month or so, we're going to be running a battle royale tabletop style game over IRC.

1833
02:20:16,860 --> 02:20:23,860
We'll have stats, we'll have the details published somewhere soon, possibly on DarkSakura.com.

1834
02:20:23,860 --> 02:20:26,860
You still have to teach me how to play so I can join in?

1835
02:20:26,860 --> 02:20:29,860
Everyone will have to learn how to play, we're making up the rules.

1836
02:20:29,860 --> 02:20:30,860
Okay, good, then you'll have to teach me.

1837
02:20:30,860 --> 02:20:31,860
I win!

1838
02:20:31,860 --> 02:20:32,860
No, you don't win.

1839
02:20:32,860 --> 02:20:37,860
I will go ahead and reveal a couple of little tiny things that aren't major secrets.

1840
02:20:37,860 --> 02:20:38,860
Can I be the guy?

1841
02:20:38,860 --> 02:20:41,860
You know the guy that does the thing?

1842
02:20:41,860 --> 02:20:49,860
We will be allowed to have a proficiency, but some proficiencies will be assigned, and one of the proficiencies is lucky bitch power.

1843
02:20:49,860 --> 02:20:57,860
Yeah, and Darkchild and I will actually be playing a lot of games this week. He's kind of like the other guy behind my reviews and such.

1844
02:20:57,860 --> 02:21:02,860
So, this week we'll try to at least get eight games and try to run them and see what happens.

1845
02:21:02,860 --> 02:21:05,860
And that's all I got right now, but next week will be better.

1846
02:21:05,860 --> 02:21:12,860
I have a review for Dracula X for the PC Engine Duo. Best game ever. Go save up the $300 and buy it.

1847
02:21:12,860 --> 02:21:18,860
I have a review for E.T. for the $2600. Best game ever.

1848
02:21:18,860 --> 02:21:25,860
I have a five word review for that. Actually, no, an eight word review. Ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass.

1849
02:21:25,860 --> 02:21:29,860
Oh, Jimmy likes the ass.

1850
02:21:29,860 --> 02:21:32,860
I have two words for you. Attack.

1851
02:21:32,860 --> 02:21:37,860
Wait, for the new ET coming out, the best part is, it's not out.

1852
02:21:37,860 --> 02:21:39,860
But it will be.

1853
02:21:39,860 --> 02:21:44,860
The best part will be when you don't turn on your console to play it.

1854
02:21:44,860 --> 02:21:47,860
Okay, I think now's a good time to take a break.

1855
02:21:47,860 --> 02:21:50,860
Yeah.

1856
02:21:50,860 --> 02:21:57,860
Alright, this break, since the last break we did all these songs that start with A,

1857
02:21:57,860 --> 02:22:01,860
I thought it would be only appropriate to do songs that start with X, Y, and Z.

1858
02:22:01,860 --> 02:22:08,860
all sex. So here we go, we'll be right back.

1859
02:23:01,860 --> 02:23:03,860
Yeah

1860
02:27:03,860 --> 02:27:09,140
Alright, we're setting up now for Orange Lounge match game we're going to play tonight, but

1861
02:27:09,140 --> 02:27:12,300
we have to jot down some questions really fast and get all the celebrities prepped,

1862
02:27:12,300 --> 02:27:16,620
and we have to get some contestants, so the contestants that will be playing match game

1863
02:27:16,620 --> 02:27:21,020
tonight will be the first two folks in the chat room who can answer me this question.

1864
02:27:21,020 --> 02:27:25,820
Alright, Jamie's going to get good because I don't.

1865
02:27:25,820 --> 02:27:27,380
What is Jamie's favorite shooting game?

1866
02:27:27,380 --> 02:27:29,780
Will people be able to get that though?

1867
02:27:29,780 --> 02:27:32,500
Yeah, that's because I've said it a bajillion times.

1868
02:27:32,500 --> 02:27:33,500
What's your question?

1869
02:27:33,500 --> 02:27:39,500
Who's the artist that did Dead End, and the actual artist, not Naoki?

1870
02:27:39,500 --> 02:27:42,140
So you have to answer both those questions.

1871
02:27:42,140 --> 02:27:44,660
A, who is the artist that did Deadline?

1872
02:27:44,660 --> 02:27:45,620
No, not Deadline.

1873
02:27:45,620 --> 02:27:46,120
I'm sorry.

1874
02:27:46,120 --> 02:27:46,900
Dead End.

1875
02:27:46,900 --> 02:27:48,220
Dead End, OK.

1876
02:27:48,220 --> 02:27:51,180
A, who is the artist that did Dead End, not Deadline?

1877
02:27:51,180 --> 02:27:55,380
That's question A. And B, what is Jamie's favorite shooter?

1878
02:27:55,380 --> 02:27:57,300
She said it a million times on the show.

1879
02:27:57,300 --> 02:28:00,140
We don't have anyone that gets A and B right.

1880
02:28:00,140 --> 02:28:02,700
I think A's a little easier, so we'll use A as the answer

1881
02:28:02,700 --> 02:28:04,600
than B as a tiebreaker.

1882
02:28:04,600 --> 02:28:05,560
so

1883
02:28:05,560 --> 02:28:11,480
uh... jamie's favorite shooter and the artist of the dead end

1884
02:28:11,480 --> 02:28:15,560
and uh... in the meantime we're gonna play a nice little song to uh... prep us

1885
02:28:15,560 --> 02:28:17,440
all for match game

1886
02:28:17,440 --> 02:28:20,120
uh... and that's all will be

1887
02:28:20,120 --> 02:28:23,920
doctor bomb a because this show needs help and i think this is also an inside

1888
02:28:23,920 --> 02:28:27,600
joke with jamie american right now at least i pick up on that

1889
02:28:27,600 --> 02:28:30,480
it has nothing to do it but i mean that the name of the song if you say it is a

1890
02:28:30,480 --> 02:28:32,760
word does

1891
02:28:32,760 --> 02:28:39,760
little bit of dual meaning

1892
02:29:02,760 --> 02:29:04,760
I'm an indie anime

1893
02:29:04,760 --> 02:29:08,260
I used to walk around with the space in my hand

1894
02:29:08,260 --> 02:29:11,760
Dr. Pompei is my name and my father has the same

1895
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:15,260
But everything it changed here in Tigerland

1896
02:29:15,260 --> 02:29:18,760
It's always that Tiger took my father

1897
02:29:18,760 --> 02:29:22,260
It's always that Tiger took my brother

1898
02:29:22,260 --> 02:29:25,760
It's always that Tiger took my mother

1899
02:29:25,760 --> 02:29:29,760
It's always that Tiger took my family

1900
02:29:29,760 --> 02:29:49,760
I lived with my family and friends in one house But now they all are gone, and life is not so fun But what can you expect here in Tangerland?

1901
02:29:49,760 --> 02:30:03,760
It's so wet, that I just took my father

1902
02:30:03,760 --> 02:30:20,760
One day in the warm jungle, a tiger took my stake

1903
02:30:20,760 --> 02:30:23,760
It wasn't really fun, it was a big mistake

1904
02:30:23,760 --> 02:30:27,760
I took my brother's screenshot and chucked the tiger down

1905
02:30:27,760 --> 02:30:30,760
This is how we do it here in Tigerland

1906
02:31:30,760 --> 02:31:55,760
It's so wet, the tiger took my family

1907
02:32:00,760 --> 02:32:10,760
Orange Lounge Radio. If we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

1908
02:32:10,760 --> 02:32:25,760
Alright, we are back and let's get to the winner of the match, or not the match game, we don't know that yet, but the winner of the cage match tonight,

1909
02:32:25,760 --> 02:32:32,760
SAD BUT TRUE, YOU VOTED DUCK TOY AS THE WINNER OF TONIGHT'S CAGE MATCH.

1910
02:32:33,760 --> 02:32:40,760
Oh boy. Want us to say that again?

1911
02:32:41,760 --> 02:32:47,760
That sounds like some strange Vietnamese soup. DUCK TOY! I WANT DUCK TOY!

1912
02:32:47,760 --> 02:32:51,760
That's okay, because I can bring the other Freeze Pop song next week.

1913
02:32:51,760 --> 02:32:55,760
Alright.

1914
02:32:55,760 --> 02:32:59,760
Okay, so now let's talk about contestants for Match Game.

1915
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:03,760
Nobody got both questions right.

1916
02:33:03,760 --> 02:33:07,760
Right, but we have people that got one right, and we have people that got the other one right.

1917
02:33:07,760 --> 02:33:11,760
But nobody got them both right. So, first off, the person who got

1918
02:33:11,760 --> 02:33:15,760
Jamie's favorite shooter question correct, Jamie. What's the favorite suitor?

1919
02:33:15,760 --> 02:33:25,760
First of all, for you people who try to name Doom and Hexen, those are first-person shooters.

1920
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:26,760
Those are not shooting games.

1921
02:33:26,760 --> 02:33:27,760
Those are first-person shooters.

1922
02:33:27,760 --> 02:33:28,760
There's a difference.

1923
02:33:28,760 --> 02:33:35,160
A shooter is like Gradius or Parodius or Radiant Silver Gun.

1924
02:33:35,160 --> 02:33:36,160
And R-Type.

1925
02:33:36,160 --> 02:33:37,160
R-Type's awesome.

1926
02:33:37,160 --> 02:33:42,160
But Radiant Silver Gun is my favorite shooting game, followed closely by Osha Berry Parodius.

1927
02:33:42,160 --> 02:33:45,880
So Dark Tetsuya was the only one to name Radiant Silver Gun as Jamie's favorite shooter, so

1928
02:33:45,880 --> 02:33:47,400
he's in by default.

1929
02:33:47,400 --> 02:33:49,480
So we have Dark Tetsuya versus...

1930
02:33:49,480 --> 02:33:52,960
Nah, we decided to eliminate all the people that put Hexen in Doom, because that was a

1931
02:33:52,960 --> 02:33:55,980
pretty good amount of people.

1932
02:33:55,980 --> 02:34:04,520
And we were left with somebody who said Gradius, which is kind of like Proteus, but, oh well,

1933
02:34:04,520 --> 02:34:09,360
you win by default, so Justin's Circuit is contestant number two.

1934
02:34:09,360 --> 02:34:11,120
A lot of people got NNS.

1935
02:34:11,120 --> 02:34:14,380
I was talking to all the people who, a lot of people got NNS.

1936
02:34:14,380 --> 02:34:17,540
What's funny is Dark Tetsuya, that's the one question he didn't get.

1937
02:34:17,540 --> 02:34:18,820
But he got the Radiant Silvergon one.

1938
02:34:18,820 --> 02:34:22,860
So we got one person that got in one, and one person that got in the other.

1939
02:34:22,860 --> 02:34:25,660
So we have Dark Tetsuya versus Justin Circuit.

1940
02:34:25,660 --> 02:34:26,660
Yay!

1941
02:34:26,660 --> 02:34:27,660
No, the blue wire!

1942
02:34:27,660 --> 02:34:29,660
The blue wire!

1943
02:34:29,660 --> 02:34:33,820
Anyway, I'm still trying to come up with questions as we're going here, so actually you guys,

1944
02:34:33,820 --> 02:34:35,780
I am not going to participate in Match Game tonight.

1945
02:34:35,780 --> 02:34:37,460
I'm going to write the questions.

1946
02:34:37,460 --> 02:34:43,380
But we do have our other lovely celebrities, and they are.

1947
02:34:43,380 --> 02:34:48,100
Let's go around and say hello to our fabulous celebrities.

1948
02:34:48,100 --> 02:34:56,320
Celebrity number one, tell us who you are.

1949
02:34:56,320 --> 02:35:05,100
And what are you here to plug this week?

1950
02:35:05,100 --> 02:35:07,920
Contestant number two, say hello.

1951
02:35:07,920 --> 02:35:08,920
Your mom.

1952
02:35:08,920 --> 02:35:10,880
And what are you here to plug this week?

1953
02:35:10,880 --> 02:35:11,880
Likes cheese.

1954
02:35:11,880 --> 02:35:15,960
All right, contestant number three, what is your name?

1955
02:35:15,960 --> 02:35:16,960
Hello.

1956
02:35:16,960 --> 02:35:18,840
And what are you here to plug this week?

1957
02:35:18,840 --> 02:35:20,560
Iraqi Suicide Baby.

1958
02:35:20,560 --> 02:35:21,560
Fun.

1959
02:35:21,560 --> 02:35:23,920

Actually, you're not a contestant, you're a celebrity. Celebrity number five, say hello.

Would you like to have sex with B?

1971
02:35:55,920 --> 02:35:58,920
I have to actually think about that, it's been that long.

1972
02:35:58,920 --> 02:36:00,920
Alright, celebrity number six.

1973
02:36:00,920 --> 02:36:03,920
Oh, you're not participating. Okay, so we only have five celebrities.

1974
02:36:03,920 --> 02:36:13,920
The actual match game had 5 celebrities, and we do too now tonight.

1975
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:40,920
Question, Norman the newbie was so nude at DDR, but all the regulars were really getting

1976
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:53,620
fed up with his antics and wished he would really stop doing the blank every time he

1977
02:36:53,620 --> 02:37:08,380
played. Norman the newbie was so new to DDR but all the regulars were really

1978
02:37:08,380 --> 02:37:12,520
getting fed up with his antics and wish he would really stop doing the blank

1979
02:37:12,520 --> 02:37:19,520
every time he played

1980
02:37:42,520 --> 02:38:07,040
I don't remember what this song is, but there's a video done to Golden Boy where they have

1981
02:38:07,040 --> 02:38:09,040
I've heard the jiggling done in time with the music.

1982
02:38:09,040 --> 02:38:12,040
Okay, are all the celebrities in?

1983
02:38:12,040 --> 02:38:13,040
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

1984
02:38:21,040 --> 02:38:22,040
Everybody in? Everybody in?

02:38:28,040 --> 02:38:30,040
Okay, here we go.

1989
02:38:30,040 --> 02:38:37,360
dark Tetsuya says Norman the newbie was so new to DDR but all the

1990
02:38:37,360 --> 02:38:39,920
regulars were getting really fed up with his antics and really wish he would stop

1991
02:38:39,920 --> 02:38:49,480
doing the caution drop every time he played. Justin says Norman the newbie he

1992
02:38:49,480 --> 02:38:53,560
was really sick that Norman newbie would and wish Norman the newbie would stop

1993
02:38:53,560 --> 02:38:58,560
doing the pelvic thrust every time he played.

1994
02:38:58,560 --> 02:39:01,560
Alright. Jamie, what did you say?

1995
02:39:01,560 --> 02:39:02,560
The truffle shuffle.

02:39:02,560 --> 02:39:09,560
The truffle shuffle!

1997
02:39:09,560 --> 02:39:10,560
Zero.

02:39:10,560 --> 02:39:15,560
I said that he would quit head banging to Daiken Kai.

1999
02:39:15,560 --> 02:39:18,560
I'm tired of all seeing those damn bastards sit there while they're playing Daiken Kai

2000
02:39:18,560 --> 02:39:19,560
on Easygon.

2001
02:39:19,560 --> 02:39:21,560
They look like fucking morons.

2002
02:39:21,560 --> 02:39:22,560

02:39:22,560 --> 02:39:23,920

2006
02:39:29,560 --> 02:39:30,720

2010
02:39:42,760 --> 02:39:46,200
really see making noise music like uh...

2011
02:39:46,200 --> 02:39:52,040
known for the whistle song and clapping at odd times because you know newbies, they don't

2012
02:39:52,040 --> 02:39:57,040
have rhythm in the first place so they can't keep up with the song. They're all like whoo

2013
02:39:57,040 --> 02:40:04,040
whoo, oh. Yeah, it's like that. All right, Anita. Norman the newbie needs to stop doing.

2014
02:40:04,040 --> 02:40:06,040
Oh, I don't want to say mine.

2015
02:40:06,040 --> 02:40:10,040
Norman the Newbie needs to stop doing the watermelon crawl.

2016
02:40:10,040 --> 02:40:13,040
I know. I know it's sad.

2017
02:40:13,040 --> 02:40:18,040
That's fabulous.

2018
02:40:18,040 --> 02:40:24,040
Darkchild, I really wish Norman the Newbie would stop doing the coin slot.

2019
02:40:24,040 --> 02:40:27,040
It won't fit.

2020
02:40:27,040 --> 02:40:28,040
Oh, God.

2021
02:40:28,040 --> 02:40:28,540
I know.

2022
02:40:28,540 --> 02:40:30,080
You know, you might be small enough.

2023
02:40:30,080 --> 02:40:31,840
You might not have a problem with that.

2024
02:40:36,560 --> 02:40:38,640
In-house speakers are down.

2025
02:40:38,640 --> 02:40:39,120
All right.

2026
02:40:42,120 --> 02:40:42,680
OK.

2027
02:40:42,680 --> 02:40:43,200
So.

2028
02:40:43,200 --> 02:40:44,120
You're rapping cool.

2029
02:40:47,640 --> 02:40:50,520
Here we go, next question.

2030
02:40:50,520 --> 02:40:53,520
It's all tied up at 0-0, everybody.

2031
02:40:53,520 --> 02:40:54,840
Let's get to the next question.

2032
02:40:54,840 --> 02:40:57,320
You were close to my ass, you said.

2033
02:40:57,320 --> 02:41:04,320
not close enough. Alright, next question, here we go. Zero, intern Zero, was so happy

2034
02:41:05,160 --> 02:41:12,160
when he got his first extra stage on DDR Extreme that he blanked all over the machine. Zero

2035
02:41:16,240 --> 02:41:20,740
was so happy when he got his first extra stage on DDR Extreme that he blanked all over the

2036
02:41:20,740 --> 02:41:42,860
machine.

2037
02:41:42,860 --> 02:41:49,300

p0k3smot42o

2042
02:42:20,900 --> 02:42:27,900
0 was so happy when he got extra stage on ddr extreme for the first time that he spit

2043
02:42:37,940 --> 02:42:44,940
propel all over the machine. Justin Circuit said 0 was so happy when he got his extra

2044
02:42:44,940 --> 02:42:53,940
I was so happy when he got his extra stage on DDR Extreme for the first time that he blew up all over the machine.

2045
02:42:53,940 --> 02:42:58,940
Alright, I know that could have a lot of reference. I think he's trying to go for a gimme.

2046
02:42:58,940 --> 02:43:08,940
Jamie, he was so happy he had a violent bowel movement all over the DDR machine. Amazing.

2047
02:43:08,940 --> 02:43:12,940
Hey Zero! Zero was so happy, what did he do to the machine?

2048
02:43:12,940 --> 02:43:15,940
I was so happy that I basically shit all over the machine.

2049
02:43:15,940 --> 02:43:19,940
He shit all over the machine!

2050
02:43:19,940 --> 02:43:21,940
Figuratively shit.

2051
02:43:21,940 --> 02:43:26,940
Alright, and Loki. He was so happy that he...

2052
02:43:30,940 --> 02:43:33,940
There's nothing that has to do with suicide babies in this one!

2053
02:43:33,940 --> 02:43:36,940
Jeez! I know my timing!

2054
02:43:36,940 --> 02:43:43,940
Okay, alright, um, that he came all over the machine. There we go.

2055
02:43:43,940 --> 02:43:48,940
He came all over the machine. Alright.

2056
02:43:48,940 --> 02:43:53,940
Anita, what did he do? He was so happy when he got extra stage that he...

2057
02:43:53,940 --> 02:43:54,940
Urinated!

2058
02:43:54,940 --> 02:43:58,940
Urinated all over the DDR machine. Okay.

2059
02:43:58,940 --> 02:44:02,940
And last celebrity, Dark Child. He was so happy he...

2060
02:44:02,940 --> 02:44:07,940
busted a fat milky nut all over his man-juice coating the machine like a

2061
02:44:07,940 --> 02:44:10,940
Krispy Kreme glazed donut.

2062
02:44:12,940 --> 02:44:15,940
Hold on. Wait. Good answer! Good answer!

2063
02:44:15,940 --> 02:44:19,940
I have to respond to that. Do not defame the Krispy Kremes.

2064
02:44:19,940 --> 02:44:22,940
Can't you say like Bel-Air donuts or something?

2065
02:44:22,940 --> 02:44:25,940
I'm hungry now and I want Krispy Kremes.

2066
02:44:25,940 --> 02:44:27,940
I don't want those Krispy Kremes.

2067
02:44:27,940 --> 02:44:33,940
New flavor of the month!

2068
02:44:33,940 --> 02:44:34,940
Krispy Kreme Lemon

2069
02:44:34,940 --> 02:44:37,940
And you know how many they'll sell? Here's a hint, it's in his name.

2070
02:44:37,940 --> 02:44:44,940
Alright.

2071
02:44:44,940 --> 02:44:47,940
Alright.

2072
02:44:47,940 --> 02:44:49,940
Moving on, next question.

2073
02:44:49,940 --> 02:44:56,940
Jamie was so excited to walk into game land to find that they had a radiant silver gun machine.

2074
02:44:56,940 --> 02:45:00,200
The first thing she exclaimed was blank

2075
02:45:26,940 --> 02:45:37,460
I'm waiting on one more contestant.

2076
02:45:37,460 --> 02:45:39,660
Oh, I just changed keys.

2077
02:45:39,660 --> 02:45:40,660
Yep.

2078
02:45:40,660 --> 02:45:43,140
Jamie was so excited to walk into game land to find that they had a radiant silver gun

2079
02:45:43,140 --> 02:45:44,140
machine.

2080
02:45:44,140 --> 02:45:46,540
The first thing she exclaimed was blank.

2081
02:45:46,540 --> 02:45:49,780
Do we have all the contestants in?

2082
02:45:49,780 --> 02:45:50,780
Everyone in?

2083
02:45:50,780 --> 02:45:51,780
Zero?

2084
02:45:51,780 --> 02:45:52,780
I should go last.

2085
02:45:52,780 --> 02:45:53,780
Here we go.

2086
02:45:53,780 --> 02:45:54,780
Okay, if you want to go last, we'll go last.

2087
02:45:54,780 --> 02:45:55,780
All right.

2088
02:45:55,780 --> 02:46:20,540
p0k3smot42o

2089
02:46:20,540 --> 02:46:26,620
the first thing she exclaimed, Justin Circut says, the first thing she exclaimed was, this

2090
02:46:26,620 --> 02:46:33,620
game is mine! Dark Tetsuya said, the first thing she exclaimed was, squee! Alright, here

2091
02:46:37,780 --> 02:46:40,740
we go, around the room. Jamie wants to go last, so we'll start with zero. What was the

2092
02:46:40,740 --> 02:46:43,500
first thing? Oh, we're gonna go this way. Okay, we'll just go in backwards. Dark Child,

2093
02:46:43,500 --> 02:46:50,500
first thing she said was

2094
02:46:52,860 --> 02:46:54,140
okay Anita

2095
02:46:54,140 --> 02:47:01,140
first thing she exclaimed was

2096
02:47:02,380 --> 02:47:03,700
beautiful

2097
02:47:03,700 --> 02:47:05,420
oh my god

2098
02:47:05,420 --> 02:47:08,660
I just made my own Krispy Kreme glazed donut

2099
02:47:08,660 --> 02:47:11,940
I just made my own Krispy Kreme glazed donut

2100
02:47:11,940 --> 02:47:18,940
You're welcome.

2101
02:47:20,500 --> 02:47:22,000
First thing she exclaimed was?

2102
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:23,300
This is a hard one.

2103
02:47:23,300 --> 02:47:24,620
Squee, of course.

2104
02:47:24,620 --> 02:47:31,620
Alright, Squee, so we have a point for Dartsuya, hooray!

2105
02:47:33,500 --> 02:47:36,440
Next up, Zero. First thing she exclaimed was?

2106
02:47:36,440 --> 02:47:40,420
Why the fuck isn't anybody playing this game?

2107
02:47:40,420 --> 02:47:43,260
I actually did think that.

2108
02:47:43,260 --> 02:47:52,340
It was sitting there, beautiful, all alone, and for one credit, and I have to hold the

2109
02:47:52,340 --> 02:48:00,420
microphone away so everyone holds your ears, I went, Squeak, like that.

2110
02:48:00,420 --> 02:48:02,460
I actually made a mistake.

2111
02:48:02,460 --> 02:48:07,500
Justin Circuit's answer was actually, because I only saw the part that was in caps, he actually

2112
02:48:07,500 --> 02:48:12,140
said, Squeak, this game is mine. That was the full answer. So he actually got a point

2113
02:48:12,140 --> 02:48:19,140
too. And they both get two points. Yes. So. But I did a very high pitched Squeak. Okay,

2114
02:48:19,880 --> 02:48:26,880
so we are all tied up at 2-2. Oh my god, that game is beautiful. Okay. And Ikaruga is going

2115
02:48:28,360 --> 02:48:33,780
to be out on the GameCube soon. Alright, uh, one more, okay, two more questions. Here we

2126
02:50:02,580 --> 02:50:06,340
Justice circuit says pole dancing too much pole dancing

2127
02:50:08,220 --> 02:50:13,260
Dark Tetsuya says there will be too much humping the coin slots. All right, Jamie

2128
02:50:13,260 --> 02:50:19,880
What did you say nudist colony couldn't get it because there will be too much groin stank from sweaty balls groin stank from sweaty

2129
02:50:21,620 --> 02:50:23,620
Oh my god, I

2130
02:50:23,620 --> 02:50:29,620
I now have to save that to put into one of my future stories because I like that reference.

2131
02:50:29,620 --> 02:50:33,620
I've just mentally thrown up.

2132
02:50:33,620 --> 02:50:35,620
What?

2133
02:50:35,620 --> 02:50:37,620
I've just mentally thrown up.

2134
02:50:37,620 --> 02:50:40,620
Okay, but the nudist colony couldn't get it because there will be too much...

2135
02:50:40,620 --> 02:50:42,620
Old people body parts flopping around.

2136
02:50:42,620 --> 02:50:45,620
Old people body parts flopping around. Loki, I fear this answer.

2137
02:50:45,620 --> 02:50:49,620
Does the nudist colony refuse to get parapar because there's going to be too much?

2138
02:50:49,620 --> 02:51:00,620
Well, actually, you're going to have to rephrase it, because there's going to be too much of a nice fish market smell in the air.

2139
02:51:00,620 --> 02:51:04,620
So kind of the reverse of the Stank Balls answer.

2140
02:51:04,620 --> 02:51:06,620
Pubic Stank!

2141
02:51:06,620 --> 02:51:16,620
Oh, God! That's a phrase I never wanted to hear on this show. It took 40 episodes to hear Pubic Stank on this show, thank you.

2142
02:51:16,620 --> 02:51:21,620
Oh god, are we in kindergarten? We're making milestones every minute.

2143
02:51:21,620 --> 02:51:22,620
Absolutely.

2144
02:51:22,620 --> 02:51:28,620
Well, you know what my original answer was? My original answer was flying snake grenade.

2145
02:51:28,620 --> 02:51:31,620
The pub stings.

2146
02:51:31,620 --> 02:51:36,620
Anita, the nudist colony refused to get far apart because there would be too much...

2147
02:51:36,620 --> 02:51:42,620
I don't understand why this is so funny. There would just be too much testicular dryness.

2148
02:51:42,620 --> 02:51:46,420
this is a very serious subject we're talking about here I mean you don't do

2149
02:51:46,420 --> 02:51:51,140
you understand the incidence of testicular dryness in this country you

2150
02:51:51,140 --> 02:51:57,500
just don't even know how serious a problem it is Anita I think Anita just

2151
02:51:57,500 --> 02:52:01,900
wants to volunteer to go over there and lick everyone's balls I have testicular

2152
02:52:01,900 --> 02:52:11,900
If you want him to come faster, you need to lick his balls.

2153
02:52:11,900 --> 02:52:18,780
Wow. Wow. All I can say is wow. Let's see if we get a match on this last one with Dark

2154
02:52:18,780 --> 02:52:20,660
Child. Can I get the sound from Jamie, though?

2155
02:52:20,660 --> 02:52:26,900
Yeah, we can. Okay. There will be too much bootleg porn on

2156
02:52:26,900 --> 02:52:29,740
the internet. Bootleg porn on the internet. Good answer,

2157
02:52:29,740 --> 02:52:36,740
but not a match.

2158
02:52:59,740 --> 02:53:03,900
Robin was surprised that no one at the local gay bar knew what the DDR was

2159
02:53:03,900 --> 02:53:08,040
he thought the best way to explain it to them was to blank

2160
02:53:08,040 --> 02:53:15,040
however surprised that no one at the local gay bar knew what DDR was he

2161
02:53:17,980 --> 02:53:20,720
thought the best way to explain it to them was to play

2162
02:53:20,720 --> 02:53:23,340
0

2163
02:53:23,340 --> 02:53:42,340
Rob was surprised that no one at the local gay bar knew what DDR was, because DDR is such a gay game. He thought that the best way to explain it to them was to blank.

2164
02:53:42,340 --> 02:53:47,340
One contestant is locked in, I think. Let me just verify this answer.

2165
02:53:48,340 --> 02:53:53,340
Ah, brilliant answer. I'm waiting on one more contestant.

2166
02:53:53,340 --> 02:54:17,340
justincircuit says, we're going to have a tie, and there's not enough time for a tiebreaker.

2167
02:54:17,340 --> 02:54:19,340
Alright, everybody's in.

2168
02:54:19,340 --> 02:54:21,340
Okay, here we go.

2169
02:54:21,340 --> 02:54:23,340
Justin Circuit says,

2170
02:54:23,340 --> 02:54:25,340
Rob was surprised that no one at the local gay bar knew what DDR was.

2171
02:54:25,340 --> 02:54:28,340
He thought the best way to explain it to them was to

2172
02:54:28,340 --> 02:54:32,340
undress slowly while on the DDR machine.

2173
02:54:32,340 --> 02:54:33,340
Blink.

2174
02:54:33,340 --> 02:54:35,340
Except there's no DDR machine at the gay bar,

2175
02:54:35,340 --> 02:54:41,340
or else I, I just, wouldn't I just point and say that's DDR?

2176
02:54:41,340 --> 02:54:45,340
You, you, you point it, just not with your fingers.

2177
02:54:45,340 --> 02:54:46,340
Whatever.

2178
02:54:46,340 --> 02:54:54,340
Alright, DarkTetsuya says the best way to explain it to them was to grab the nearest chair and start stomping his feet wildly like he's playing Legend of Max.

2179
02:54:54,340 --> 02:54:56,340
There we go. Good answer.

2180
02:54:56,340 --> 02:54:58,340
Alright, let's see if it's either one of those two matches.

2181
02:54:58,340 --> 02:55:02,340
Jamie, Rob's best way to explain this at the gay bar was to...

2182
02:55:02,340 --> 02:55:04,340
Propel.

2183
02:55:06,340 --> 02:55:08,340
Oh my god.

2184
02:55:08,340 --> 02:55:11,340
That was a total, like, EOSFVB answer. Anyway...

2185
02:55:11,340 --> 02:55:15,340
It was zero. The best way to explain it to them was to...

2186
02:55:15,340 --> 02:55:18,340
Tell him DDR stood for Dick Dick Revolution.

2187
02:55:18,340 --> 02:55:22,340
Tell him DDR stood for Dick Dick Revolution.

2188
02:55:22,340 --> 02:55:28,340
And with some of the players, that's very true. In fact, if you go to this one arcade, it's called... never mind.

2189
02:55:28,340 --> 02:55:32,340
That's a match game question for next week.

2190
02:55:32,340 --> 02:55:37,340
Loki, Rob thought the best way to explain it to them was to...

2191
02:55:37,340 --> 02:55:42,340
Was to point out anybody that's doing White Boy Freestyle.

2192
02:55:42,340 --> 02:55:45,840
point out anybody that's doing white boy freestyle beautiful

2193
02:55:45,840 --> 02:55:50,240
Anita, the best way to explain what DDR was was to

2194
02:55:50,240 --> 02:55:53,920
I thought the best way was to strip butt naked

2195
02:55:53,920 --> 02:55:56,960
in country line dance in front of the karaoke machine while playing

2196
02:55:56,960 --> 02:56:01,280
It's Raining Men. I did that two weeks ago

2197
02:56:01,280 --> 02:56:07,360
at least that involved nudity which is exciting

2198
02:56:07,360 --> 02:56:20,360
The best way to explain DDR was to shimmy, sashay, pirouette, left cheek, right cheek, blow a kiss, pose. It's fabulous.

2199
02:56:20,360 --> 02:56:27,360
Oh my god!

2200
02:56:27,360 --> 02:56:34,360
Everybody wants to know how a dark child knows this.

2201
02:56:34,360 --> 02:56:38,360
Well, what was that from, dark child?

2202
02:56:38,360 --> 02:56:40,360
I don't know, it was from a bunch of two other things.

2203
02:56:40,360 --> 02:56:42,360
Oh, even worse!

2204
02:56:42,360 --> 02:56:46,360
It kind of reminds me, I think it's a scene in Dropkick Gorgeous, but anyway, doesn't matter.

2205
02:56:46,360 --> 02:56:49,480
doesn't matter

2206
02:56:49,480 --> 02:56:54,400
i was just thinking more of a priscilla queen of the desert ah there we go yes

2207
02:56:54,400 --> 02:56:58,120
uh... so it ended in the tide tonight two points for dark tetsuya and two

2208
02:56:58,120 --> 02:57:00,620
points for justin so that means we have

2209
02:57:00,620 --> 02:57:01,960
no winner

2210
02:57:01,960 --> 02:57:04,120
you can do we like it when there's no winner

2211
02:57:04,120 --> 02:57:05,440
no

2212
02:57:05,440 --> 02:57:06,640
uh...

2213
02:57:06,640 --> 02:57:08,040
get better next time

2214
02:57:08,040 --> 02:57:11,580
i think i like you to all the players who lost

2215
02:57:11,580 --> 02:57:14,680
i'd i'd like it when no one wins because then we don't have to think of prizes to

2216
02:57:14,680 --> 02:57:17,680
Well, what are some consolation prizes we should give these two for tying?

2217
02:57:17,680 --> 02:57:19,680
A box of Rice-A-Roni, the San Francisco treat.

2218
02:57:19,680 --> 02:57:22,680
Ding-ding.

2219
02:57:22,680 --> 02:57:25,680
How about their own personal home version of Deep Pick Revolution?

2220
02:57:25,680 --> 02:57:31,680
You two will personally get me explaining DDR to you in Anita Fashions.

2221
02:57:31,680 --> 02:57:36,680
How about you make them get the next PC version of DDR?

2222
02:57:36,680 --> 02:57:39,680
Mr. Spanky will come over and explain.

2223
02:57:39,680 --> 02:57:42,680
They get a hand in a bottle of Crisco.

2224
02:57:42,680 --> 02:57:44,680
That makes me a sad panda.

2225
02:57:44,680 --> 02:57:47,680
Did you see what I thought you said?

2226
02:57:47,680 --> 02:57:54,680
They get a hand in a can of Crisco.

2227
02:57:54,680 --> 02:57:57,680
Ha!

2228
02:57:57,680 --> 02:58:01,680
And it's time for the jingle.

2229
02:58:01,680 --> 02:58:03,680
Ready?

2230
02:58:03,680 --> 02:58:06,680
Rice-a-roni, the San Francisco treat.

2231
02:58:06,680 --> 02:58:13,680
no

2232
02:58:14,840 --> 02:58:19,640
by the way i have to give a public thank you over the air to uh... sharks girl

2233
02:58:19,640 --> 02:58:22,200

2234
02:58:22,200 --> 02:58:24,240
and then they

2235
02:58:24,240 --> 02:58:28,040
is the big pink one that they can do it in the test tube

2236
02:58:28,040 --> 02:58:32,520
nobody got me a filler bunny for my birthday

2237
02:58:32,520 --> 02:58:35,040
hahahaha

2238
02:58:35,040 --> 02:58:39,840

02:58:43,880 --> 02:58:45,840
final thought

2241
02:58:45,840 --> 02:58:47,440

2242
02:58:47,440 --> 02:58:52,040

2243
02:58:52,040 --> 02:58:54,040

02:58:54,040 --> 02:58:57,320
low-key needs food badly

2245
02:58:57,320 --> 02:58:59,680
anita final thought

2246
02:58:59,680 --> 02:59:05,980
I've just detected a fault in the AE-35 unit.

2247
02:59:05,980 --> 02:59:08,580
Ice Queen, final thought?

2248
02:59:08,580 --> 02:59:11,740
I need sex.

2249
02:59:11,740 --> 02:59:13,420
Dark Child, final thought?

2250
02:59:13,420 --> 02:59:17,060
Dark Child is about to die.

2251
02:59:17,060 --> 02:59:26,060
And my final thought is also, my final thought is also, I need sex, but not with Ice Queen.

2252
02:59:26,060 --> 02:59:38,360
The final word of the night.

2253
02:59:38,360 --> 02:59:39,360
Jamie got it last week.

2254
02:59:39,360 --> 02:59:40,360
The final word of the night.

2255
02:59:40,360 --> 02:59:43,200
Anita, what is tonight's final word of the night?

2256
02:59:43,200 --> 02:59:50,360
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2261
03:00:11,040 --> 03:00:15,480
Dungeons and dragons, Satan's game.

2262
03:00:15,480 --> 03:00:21,380
Your children, like it or not, are attracted in their weaker years to the occult.

2263
03:00:21,380 --> 03:00:26,880
and a game like D&D fuels their imagination and makes them feel special

2264
03:00:26,880 --> 03:00:31,880
while drawing them deeper and deeper into the bowels of El Diablo.

2265
03:00:31,880 --> 03:00:38,880
This afternoon, the Dead Ale Wives Watchtower invites you to sit in on an actual gaming session.

2266
03:00:38,880 --> 03:00:41,880
Observe the previously unobservable,

2267
03:00:41,880 --> 03:00:48,880
as a hidden camera takes you to the inner sanctum of Dungeons & Dragons.

2268
03:00:48,880 --> 03:00:54,060
Galstaff, you have entered the door to the north.

2269
03:00:54,060 --> 03:00:57,740
You are now by yourself, standing in a dark room.

2270
03:00:57,740 --> 03:01:01,680
The pungent stench of mildew emanates from the wet dungeon walls.

2271
03:01:01,680 --> 03:01:03,440
Where are the cheetos?

2272
03:01:03,440 --> 03:01:04,600
They're right next to you.

2273
03:01:04,600 --> 03:01:05,600
I cast a spell!

2274
03:01:05,600 --> 03:01:07,420
Where's the mountain dew?

2275
03:01:07,420 --> 03:01:08,960
In the fridge, duh!

2276
03:01:08,960 --> 03:01:09,960
I wanna cast a spell!

2277
03:01:09,960 --> 03:01:11,960
Can I have a mountain dew?

2278
03:01:11,960 --> 03:01:12,960
Yes!

2279
03:01:12,960 --> 03:01:14,640
You can have a mountain dew, just go get it!

2280
03:01:14,640 --> 03:01:16,200
I can cast any of these, right?

2281
03:01:16,200 --> 03:01:17,200
On the list?

2282
03:01:17,200 --> 03:01:18,200
Yes.

2283
03:01:18,200 --> 03:01:32,720
level one what room I want to cast magic missile he hasn't cast anything yet I

2284
03:01:32,720 --> 03:01:37,600
am though if you'd listen I'm casting magic missile why are you casting magic

2285
03:01:37,600 --> 03:01:46,880
missile there's nothing to attack here I'm attacking the darkness fine thanks

2286
03:01:46,880 --> 03:01:49,780
You attack the darkness. There's an elf in front of you.

2287
03:01:49,780 --> 03:01:51,580
Whoa! That's me, right?

2288
03:01:51,580 --> 03:01:57,080
He's wearing a brown tunic, and he has gray hair and blue eyes.

2289
03:01:57,080 --> 03:01:59,380
No, I don't. I have gray eyes.

2290
03:01:59,380 --> 03:02:00,280
Let me see that sheet.

2291
03:02:00,280 --> 03:02:04,280
Well, it says I have blue, but I decided I wanted gray eyes.

2292
03:02:04,280 --> 03:02:08,780
Whatever. Okay, you guys can talk to each other now if you want.

2293
03:02:08,780 --> 03:02:09,680
Hello.

2294
03:02:09,680 --> 03:02:10,680
Hello.

2295
03:02:10,680 --> 03:02:13,680
I am Galstaff, Sorcerer of Light.

2296
03:02:13,680 --> 03:02:15,680
Then how come you had to cast magic missiles?

2297
03:02:15,680 --> 03:02:20,680
You guys are being attacked.

2298
03:02:20,680 --> 03:02:22,680
Do I see that happening?

2299
03:02:22,680 --> 03:02:24,680
No, you're outside by the tavern.

2300
03:02:24,680 --> 03:02:26,680
Cool, I get drunk.

2301
03:02:26,680 --> 03:02:29,680
There are seven ogres surrounding you.

2302
03:02:29,680 --> 03:02:32,680
How could they surround us? I had Mordenkainen's magical watchdog cast.

2303
03:02:32,680 --> 03:02:33,680
No you didn't.

2304
03:02:33,680 --> 03:02:36,680
I'm getting drunk. Are there any girls there?

2305
03:02:36,680 --> 03:02:40,680
I totally did. You asked me if I wanted any equipment before this adventure and I said no.

2306
03:02:40,680 --> 03:02:43,680
But I need material components for all my spells.

2307
03:02:43,680 --> 03:02:48,020
So I cast Mordenkainen's faithful watchdog, but you never actually cast it

2308
03:02:51,140 --> 03:02:53,140
Yeah, you are

2309
03:02:53,820 --> 03:03:01,460
Yeah, I did though I completely fed when you asked me no you didn't you didn't actually say that you were casting the spell

2310
03:03:01,460 --> 03:03:03,460
So now there's ogres. Okay

2311
03:03:03,460 --> 03:03:08,460
Man, I got an ogre slaying knife! It's got a plus nine against ogres!

2312
03:03:08,460 --> 03:03:10,460
You're not there! You're getting drunk!

2313
03:03:10,460 --> 03:03:14,460
Okay, but if there's any girls there, I wanna do them!

2314
03:03:14,460 --> 03:03:19,460
There you have it. A frightening look into America's most frightening pastime.

2315
03:03:19,460 --> 03:03:26,460
Remember that it's not your children's fault that they're being drawn into a satanic world of nightmare.

2316
03:03:26,460 --> 03:03:32,460
It's their gym teacher's fault for making them feel outcast when they couldn't do one single pull-up.

2317
03:03:32,460 --> 03:03:43,420
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
