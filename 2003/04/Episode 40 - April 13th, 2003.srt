00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:02,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Message for you, son!

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Attention!

3
00:00:05,011 --> 00:00:08,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

4
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:15,554
[SPEAKER_32]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

5
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:22,161
[SPEAKER_32]: Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

6
00:00:22,482 --> 00:00:25,684
[SPEAKER_32]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

7
00:00:26,244 --> 00:00:28,966
[SPEAKER_32]: Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

00:00:29,507 --> 00:00:32,409
[SPEAKER_32]: Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

9
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:33,610
[SPEAKER_14]: Just kidding.

10
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,411
[SPEAKER_14]: Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

11
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:42,796
[SPEAKER_20]: In this episode... Hey, any balls down there?

12
00:00:42,836 --> 00:00:45,798
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the biggest bear you ever seen, Jingleberry.

13
00:00:45,918 --> 00:00:48,000
[SPEAKER_20]: What's your favorite scary movie?

14
00:00:49,073 --> 00:00:49,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Showgirls.

15
00:00:50,554 --> 00:00:51,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely frightful.

16
00:00:51,954 --> 00:00:52,535
[SPEAKER_03]: What's yours?

17
00:00:52,775 --> 00:00:55,256
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

18
00:00:55,316 --> 00:00:56,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't torture yourself.

19
00:00:57,197 --> 00:00:58,017
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my job.

20
00:00:58,117 --> 00:00:59,938
[SPEAKER_15]: Now's the time our sprockets bend me dogs!

21
00:00:59,998 --> 00:01:03,100
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll get you, my pretty.

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,640
[SPEAKER_18]: And your little dog, too.

23
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:05,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Kung Fu.

24
00:01:06,301 --> 00:01:08,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

25
00:01:08,962 --> 00:01:10,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did they have to take the word gay?

26
00:01:12,424 --> 00:01:15,065
[SPEAKER_17]: No one expects a Spanish exposition!

27
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,086
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Kendo.

28
00:01:19,036 --> 00:01:20,817
[SPEAKER_32]: DarkSakura Shut up!

29
00:01:21,017 --> 00:01:21,697
[SPEAKER_29]: Where's my gun?

30
00:01:21,817 --> 00:01:23,737
[SPEAKER_29]: This is my boomstick!

31
00:01:24,238 --> 00:01:26,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Sky Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!

32
00:01:27,058 --> 00:01:30,840
[SPEAKER_24]: Loki I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.

33
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,620
[SPEAKER_17]: What kind of warped human being would find that funny?

34
00:01:33,881 --> 00:01:35,301
[SPEAKER_32]: Orange Lounge Radio

35
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,581
[SPEAKER_14]: We are live, and this is episode number 40 for April the 13th of 2003.

36
00:01:41,661 --> 00:01:51,585
[SPEAKER_14]: You're tuned into the B-Money scene's most interesting radio station of all things B-Money.

37
00:01:52,805 --> 00:01:54,866
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Rob Roberts, and you might know me as Sky.

38
00:01:55,386 --> 00:01:57,347
[SPEAKER_14]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.

39
00:01:57,407 --> 00:01:59,848
[SPEAKER_14]: In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

40
00:01:59,888 --> 00:02:01,348
[SPEAKER_14]: You know her better as DarkSakura.

41
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:02,549
[SPEAKER_04]: You rappin' cool.

42
00:02:04,065 --> 00:02:07,849
[SPEAKER_14]: and in the back playing with our brand new mixing board, TEE.

43
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Say hello to our tech master, Loki.

44
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:12,393
[SPEAKER_14]: And just make sure it doesn't go into the yellow too much.

45
00:02:14,015 --> 00:02:17,378
[SPEAKER_14]: And also with us tonight... I think you'll be turning down Rob's channel a lot.

46
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:18,439
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey now.

47
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,522
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you saying that I have a voice that carries?

48
00:02:22,803 --> 00:02:25,886
[SPEAKER_14]: This is great because with this new mixing board you can still hear me.

49
00:02:26,127 --> 00:02:27,288
[SPEAKER_14]: Ewan, I'm all the way over here.

50
00:02:32,398 --> 00:02:32,698
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

51
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:36,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, oh yes, say hello to Intern Zero.

52
00:02:37,403 --> 00:02:40,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you know the show is like over the hill now?

53
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:41,767
[SPEAKER_11]: I know!

54
00:02:42,688 --> 00:02:44,450
[SPEAKER_11]: We're turning 40 tonight, we're over the hill.

55
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,432
[SPEAKER_11]: You're like magical and stuff.

56
00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:48,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Does this mean we're going to have a mid-show crisis?

57
00:02:50,135 --> 00:02:52,638
[SPEAKER_14]: It was just after last week's breakdown mid-show.

58
00:02:53,278 --> 00:02:53,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember?

59
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,962
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh my god, I feel old, I need to go to bed.

60
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,383
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember how we almost had a big crisis mid-show last week?

61
00:03:01,403 --> 00:03:03,485
[SPEAKER_14]: Like a giant fight starting with zero?

62
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,467
[SPEAKER_11]: It was so neat.

63
00:03:05,787 --> 00:03:08,370
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that was just going off on a stupid song.

64
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,592
[SPEAKER_11]: But see, I am the mid-show crisis.

65
00:03:11,413 --> 00:03:12,033
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a good day.

66
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:14,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Why are you so angry?

67
00:03:15,437 --> 00:03:15,957
[SPEAKER_11]: Why am I so angry?

68
00:03:15,977 --> 00:03:16,818
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't be angry.

69
00:03:16,858 --> 00:03:17,839
[SPEAKER_11]: That's Jamie's role.

70
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,761
[SPEAKER_11]: I can be angry, but I can't do that.

71
00:03:21,934 --> 00:03:26,858
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't be angry, though, because I am actually happy today, which is new and different.

72
00:03:27,618 --> 00:03:29,640
[SPEAKER_11]: He just threw a penny at me.

73
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,101
[SPEAKER_11]: A panty?

74
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:31,421
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

75
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:32,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, a penny.

76
00:03:32,402 --> 00:03:32,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, a penny.

77
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,403
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought you said a panty.

78
00:03:34,463 --> 00:03:35,624
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, wow, that's erotic.

79
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:39,127
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't need people to throw pennies at me anymore now that I got a damn job.

80
00:03:39,827 --> 00:03:42,909
[SPEAKER_14]: Ooh, we'll have to hear more about that when we come back from the first break.

81
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:45,892
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds like we have a lot to be thankful for this week.

82
00:03:45,912 --> 00:03:47,933
[SPEAKER_14]: We might have to get rid of the FUs and do a happy segment.

83
00:03:48,454 --> 00:03:49,134
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck that.

84
00:03:49,514 --> 00:03:50,275
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, fuck that.

85
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,358
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.

86
00:03:53,698 --> 00:03:58,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Lots of people saying hello to Zero in the chat room, including Angel and the other folks here.

87
00:04:01,063 --> 00:04:05,025
[SPEAKER_14]: However, if you want to get in our chat room and say hello, it's easy.

88
00:04:05,105 --> 00:04:11,589
[SPEAKER_14]: Just go to www.callybomani.com, our friends over there, and click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.

89
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:12,510
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just that simple.

90
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,732
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we're going to start off this break with what, Jamie?

91
00:04:17,901 --> 00:04:19,222
[SPEAKER_14]: This isn't crap, I like this song.

92
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:21,623
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we're gonna start it off with old shit.

93
00:04:22,004 --> 00:04:27,847
[SPEAKER_14]: Old shit, okay, so we're gonna hear some old Mamadi music, and we'll be back to talk about a lot of stuff.

94
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,548
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot, a lot, a lot of stuff to talk about this week.

95
00:04:29,609 --> 00:04:37,153
[SPEAKER_14]: And by the way, tonight, you guys, get your friends on the station, because tonight we have Kyle Snyder's new single, live from March Madness.

96
00:04:38,054 --> 00:04:39,215
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm moist with anticipation.

97
00:04:39,535 --> 00:04:46,940
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a miracle I actually got him, I convinced him to sing it a second time, because he kept getting interrupted, and he's like, I'm not gonna do it anymore.

98
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,500
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not gonna do it anymore.

99
00:05:08,366 --> 00:05:25,068
[SPEAKER_20]: And bring my wagons around, Mug it out, To the man in the sky of the bridge, Mug it out, When nobody wants to feed anyone, And nobody's backing me, I wanna be with the bridge,

100
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,151

[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for watching!

Thanks for watching!

107
00:10:55,256 --> 00:11:03,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

108
00:11:03,822 --> 00:11:09,726
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

109
00:11:11,888 --> 00:11:14,029
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we have to start tonight's show off.

110
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:20,073
[SPEAKER_04]: This episode is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the letter G, just like March Madness was.

111
00:11:20,093 --> 00:11:21,995
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, that's not it.

112
00:11:24,013 --> 00:11:26,394
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, March Madness was brought to you by the letter Sakura.

113
00:11:26,674 --> 00:11:30,615
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, I've got this music... I've got this music playing for a reason.

114
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:35,377
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to start tonight's show off with a quick Ask Orange Lounge segment, because we have a question for Loki, and this is important.

115
00:11:36,337 --> 00:11:36,657
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

116
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:37,197
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

117
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:42,859
[SPEAKER_14]: Japan Man wants to know, where in the hell he can get his hands on that new Schlagwerk remix you did that we debuted last week?

118
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,380
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, nowhere right now.

119
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,121
[SPEAKER_24]: But I'll put it up, I'll put it up later.

120
00:11:48,201 --> 00:11:48,981
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, where's it gonna be?

121
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:50,161
[SPEAKER_24]: It's gonna be on my site.

122
00:11:50,421 --> 00:11:51,822
[SPEAKER_14]: Where is your site, for those that don't know?

123
00:11:53,742 --> 00:11:58,664
[SPEAKER_24]: www.willddrforfood.net slash leechfromloki Beautiful.

124
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,946
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's where you can download this new Schlagwerk single.

125
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:03,647
[SPEAKER_14]: Whenever Loki gets off his butt and puts it up.

126
00:12:04,468 --> 00:12:06,349
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

127
00:12:12,252 --> 00:12:15,354
[SPEAKER_24]: Or you can get it from DarkSakura because she's got it too.

128
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:18,663
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can beg one of us in chat and we'll give it to you.

129
00:12:18,783 --> 00:12:19,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm stingy.

130
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:21,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Just not during the show because we're trying to do the show.

131
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,266
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to offer me favors.

132
00:12:22,286 --> 00:12:23,808
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to buy me that hot rod toy.

133
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:27,691
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, well, I can do this later if it's not on my site.

134
00:12:27,711 --> 00:12:28,111
[SPEAKER_14]: Go for it.

135
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:28,652
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't care.

136
00:12:28,852 --> 00:12:29,172
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

137
00:12:29,192 --> 00:12:33,356
[SPEAKER_14]: We totally neglected the sim update last week, so let's just start tonight with a sim update, shall we?

138
00:12:33,616 --> 00:12:36,139
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, I've got to hold this guy who goes...

139
00:12:36,906 --> 00:12:37,326
[SPEAKER_24]: What the hell is that?

140
00:12:37,427 --> 00:12:38,288
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, he got food.

141
00:12:38,748 --> 00:12:39,269
[SPEAKER_24]: Not for me though.

142
00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:40,930
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyways, this guy is Shuey.

143
00:12:41,131 --> 00:12:43,053
[SPEAKER_24]: He's done a bunch of stuff.

144
00:12:43,733 --> 00:12:46,476
[SPEAKER_24]: Right now what he's been doing is like the DDR Game Boy stuff.

145
00:12:46,496 --> 00:12:50,701
[SPEAKER_24]: He has all the sim files for all the DDR Game Boy tracks.

146
00:12:51,322 --> 00:12:52,163
[SPEAKER_24]: So we've got those.

147
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,946
[SPEAKER_24]: But we're going to swap our collections.

148
00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:55,847
[SPEAKER_24]: And this guy's got 4,000.

149
00:12:55,907 --> 00:12:56,327
[SPEAKER_24]: And I have 2,000.

150
00:12:59,835 --> 00:13:00,115
[SPEAKER_24]: Wow.

151
00:13:00,435 --> 00:13:01,976
[SPEAKER_24]: But he has, like, one of everything.

152
00:13:02,737 --> 00:13:05,238
[SPEAKER_24]: He collects, like, everything off the sites.

153
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:11,202
[SPEAKER_24]: So, you know, whereas I might have, like, one good one for, you know, Schlagwerk, whatever.

154
00:13:11,242 --> 00:13:15,445
[SPEAKER_24]: He'll have every single one ever made for Schlagwerk, which, you know, obviously I don't want to do.

155
00:13:15,505 --> 00:13:16,846
[SPEAKER_24]: But, hey, it's cool, you know.

156
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:20,328
[SPEAKER_24]: So we're going to be trading those, and that's awesome, and I can't wait to do that.

157
00:13:20,828 --> 00:13:23,730
[SPEAKER_24]: And then I finally got up all my...

158
00:13:25,311 --> 00:13:25,972
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.

159
00:13:25,992 --> 00:13:28,974
[SPEAKER_24]: Right now I'm averaging about one update a month, so that's about what we're going to have.

160
00:13:28,994 --> 00:13:30,295
[SPEAKER_24]: Aside from all that...

161
00:13:50,971 --> 00:13:51,512
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's see.

162
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:55,995
[SPEAKER_24]: Definitely check out Bomani Sims because you can always get new files there.

163
00:13:56,475 --> 00:13:58,897
[SPEAKER_24]: Even though some of them are like rehashed old shit.

164
00:13:58,937 --> 00:14:02,479
[SPEAKER_24]: But, you know, a lot of new stuff, especially UtterDude.

165
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:04,540
[SPEAKER_24]: He does some really awesome sim files.

166
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,781
[SPEAKER_24]: He's like my number one now.

167
00:14:06,682 --> 00:14:08,863
[SPEAKER_24]: Only because Healing Vision doesn't do them fast enough.

168
00:14:09,163 --> 00:14:11,265
[SPEAKER_24]: But he'd be my number one, you know.

169
00:14:12,306 --> 00:14:15,168
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, speaking of Healing Vision, I'm going to have... He's my first...

170
00:14:15,948 --> 00:14:23,830
[SPEAKER_24]: SimFileCreatorInterview, E, and so I've got that coming up along with all of his files, so that'll be later on.

171
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:27,572
[SPEAKER_24]: And then, um, I don't know, just not too much going on.

172
00:14:28,092 --> 00:14:37,055
[SPEAKER_24]: There's, you know, what was it, Havoc got a hold of the Euromix 2 disc, so he's ripping the banners and stuff from that, so hopefully we'll have some clean banners for that.

173
00:14:37,295 --> 00:14:43,537
[SPEAKER_24]: And then, um, oh, just a bunch of minor stuff, not really anything new with, um, set me in no new releases or anything.

174
00:14:44,397 --> 00:14:44,537
[SPEAKER_24]: Um...

175
00:14:47,392 --> 00:14:51,734
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, Zero's Files are back up on Bomani Sims and that's pretty much it.

176
00:14:51,914 --> 00:14:52,574
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, not too much.

177
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:55,775
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

178
00:14:59,117 --> 00:15:01,257
[SPEAKER_14]: So, happy 40th birthday everybody!

179
00:15:01,858 --> 00:15:02,778
Yay!

180
00:15:03,158 --> 00:15:04,298
[SPEAKER_14]: We are 40 weeks old.

181
00:15:04,378 --> 00:15:14,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, we're older than that because we did two pre-taped shows and a pre-empted week so we're actually somewhere around 43 or 44 years old but it's the 40th actual show, you guys.

182
00:15:15,854 --> 00:15:17,736
[SPEAKER_14]: Favorite memory from the past 40 episodes?

183
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:20,119
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think?

184
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:21,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Favorite memory from the past 40 episodes?

185
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:26,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Out of every single show we've done, what was the funniest or best memory that we did?

186
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:27,267
[SPEAKER_11]: My debut.

187
00:15:27,987 --> 00:15:29,149
[SPEAKER_14]: Which was, do you remember what number that was?

188
00:15:29,169 --> 00:15:29,149
32.

189
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,333
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't remember shit.

190
00:15:36,216 --> 00:15:36,717
[SPEAKER_14]: You remember, Loki?

191
00:15:38,211 --> 00:15:40,072
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm thinking... This should be a list list some week.

192
00:15:40,092 --> 00:15:40,633
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll do that for 50.

193
00:15:41,193 --> 00:15:46,396
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm thinking because I want to say there was one night I had you guys laughing really hard.

194
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:47,717
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't remember what it was.

195
00:15:48,337 --> 00:15:49,978
[SPEAKER_24]: It was one of the FUs of the week.

196
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:51,419
[SPEAKER_24]: I just can't remember.

197
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:57,803
[SPEAKER_24]: Anytime I have food because I'm hungry and I'm broke at the moment.

198
00:15:57,903 --> 00:15:59,624
[SPEAKER_24]: I haven't taken any money out from the bank.

199
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:01,886
[SPEAKER_24]: So, I need food.

200
00:16:04,687 --> 00:16:07,129
[SPEAKER_14]: I would say episode probably...

201
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:17,395
[SPEAKER_14]: either episode number 8, which was the one, it was a really early episode, we had DDR Mike and Jazz here, I remember that, because that's when we got into the whole discussion about Pantsless Rage and Three-Titted Emmy.

202
00:16:18,055 --> 00:16:18,715
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a classic.

203
00:16:19,216 --> 00:16:24,838
[SPEAKER_14]: And episode, I think it was 27, that was the one when Angel and Stressa, it was their first visit in town.

204
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:28,280
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the night when I realized that Orange Lounge had taken over this house.

205
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Because there were so damn many people here that night, you remember that?

206
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:31,862
[SPEAKER_14]: It was crazy.

207
00:16:33,523 --> 00:16:34,263
[SPEAKER_04]: And I quit myself.

208
00:16:34,283 --> 00:16:36,204
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember shit.

209
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:41,372
[SPEAKER_14]: Some folks in the chat room say their favorite memory is all the porn talk.

210
00:16:44,674 --> 00:16:45,814
[SPEAKER_04]: I like when I had balls.

211
00:16:46,815 --> 00:16:47,335
[SPEAKER_14]: When was that?

212
00:16:47,776 --> 00:16:48,276
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

213
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the first time Jonas showed up.

214
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:51,338
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, where's our balls?

215
00:16:51,438 --> 00:16:52,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Jonas was supposed to bring some for us.

216
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:53,699
[SPEAKER_11]: We're still missing them.

217
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,760
[SPEAKER_14]: You having trouble finding your balls?

218
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:58,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, because I paid him $2 to go get them.

219
00:16:59,502 --> 00:17:01,864
[SPEAKER_24]: I hope he remembers to get food for me.

220
00:17:02,144 --> 00:17:05,346
[SPEAKER_24]: Sending brainwaves, brainwaves, brainwaves, brainwaves.

221
00:17:08,621 --> 00:17:09,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Where's what?

222
00:17:09,121 --> 00:17:09,702
[SPEAKER_14]: Video recorder.

223
00:17:11,123 --> 00:17:12,004
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that it on the ground?

224
00:17:12,244 --> 00:17:12,644
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

225
00:17:12,924 --> 00:17:13,345
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, no.

226
00:17:13,485 --> 00:17:14,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Jonas left stuff here.

227
00:17:14,145 --> 00:17:17,468
[SPEAKER_11]: My favorite, like, thing was March Madness when I just went off.

228
00:17:18,149 --> 00:17:20,450
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was so funny because I pissed people off.

229
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:21,231
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know why.

230
00:17:22,772 --> 00:17:28,917
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, then I guess we could say my favorite thing was, like, slowly becoming insane during Shaft.

231
00:17:29,357 --> 00:17:29,998
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, yeah.

232
00:17:30,358 --> 00:17:31,639
[SPEAKER_24]: That was classic.

233
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,701
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sick and I don't care.

234
00:17:33,721 --> 00:17:35,522
[SPEAKER_24]: I want you to die.

235
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,043
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm hungry.

236
00:17:37,344 --> 00:17:37,504
[SPEAKER_24]: Food.

237
00:17:37,524 --> 00:17:37,744
[SPEAKER_24]: Food.

238
00:17:39,765 --> 00:17:45,389
[SPEAKER_14]: If you enjoyed our coverage of Shaft and March Madness, we have B3 coming up.

239
00:17:46,189 --> 00:17:50,112
[SPEAKER_14]: Which, B3 is the weekend of the 17th, I want to say?

240
00:17:50,432 --> 00:17:51,372
[SPEAKER_14]: God, I hope I'm not wrong.

241
00:17:51,633 --> 00:17:53,754
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not looking at a calendar, so forgive me if I'm messed up.

242
00:17:53,774 --> 00:17:54,034
[SPEAKER_14]: 17th?

243
00:17:54,434 --> 00:17:54,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Isn't that right?

244
00:17:55,015 --> 00:17:55,355
[SPEAKER_14]: Of May?

245
00:17:57,163 --> 00:17:57,864
[SPEAKER_24]: I hope not.

246
00:17:58,064 --> 00:17:59,125
[SPEAKER_14]: Why, what's that?

247
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,148
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's like right after E3.

248
00:18:01,168 --> 00:18:02,669
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like right after E3.

249
00:18:02,689 --> 00:18:03,670
[SPEAKER_14]: Is E3 the week before?

250
00:18:03,971 --> 00:18:08,215
[SPEAKER_14]: No, E3 is like Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and B3 is Saturday, Sunday.

251
00:18:09,377 --> 00:18:12,580
[SPEAKER_24]: Shit, I hope... Goddammit, I'm gonna miss Matrix!

252
00:18:13,381 --> 00:18:13,802
[SPEAKER_24]: No!

253
00:18:14,863 --> 00:18:15,544
[SPEAKER_24]: Can't have this!

254
00:18:16,647 --> 00:18:18,268
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll see what happens.

255
00:18:18,288 --> 00:18:22,931
[SPEAKER_14]: We're trying to see who we have to blow to get B3 tickets, by the way.

256
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:23,371
[SPEAKER_14]: E3.

257
00:18:23,651 --> 00:18:23,951
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

258
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:27,333
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have to worry about B3 tickets, but if somebody there needs blown, whatever.

259
00:18:27,793 --> 00:18:30,275
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sure people would like getting blown for free.

260
00:18:32,316 --> 00:18:35,758
[SPEAKER_14]: We're trying to get tickets to E3 really, really badly.

261
00:18:42,086 --> 00:18:43,347
[SPEAKER_14]: I was trying to make you practice.

262
00:18:43,828 --> 00:18:45,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob's trying to shove the microphone up my nose.

263
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,512
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to really say anything because this thing picks up everything.

264
00:18:49,932 --> 00:18:52,915
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm holding the microphone across the room and it's blinking.

265
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:54,236
[SPEAKER_04]: See?

266
00:18:56,618 --> 00:18:59,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob's taking volunteers of people he can practice blowing.

267
00:19:00,861 --> 00:19:01,282
[SPEAKER_29]: No!

268
00:19:01,422 --> 00:19:02,002
[SPEAKER_04]: For E3.

269
00:19:02,022 --> 00:19:05,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Not me.

270
00:19:06,366 --> 00:19:07,446
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we have an intern.

271
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:10,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you all.

272
00:19:14,678 --> 00:19:17,080
[SPEAKER_14]: I suppose we can talk about actual Bomani news tonight.

273
00:19:20,723 --> 00:19:22,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, this is the one that's on everybody's mind.

274
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:25,406
[SPEAKER_14]: You know we have to bring this up, you guys.

275
00:19:26,928 --> 00:19:29,249
[SPEAKER_14]: The big, big news that comes out this week.

276
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:37,436
[SPEAKER_14]: Electronics Boutique, on their website, is now taking pre-orders for Dance Dance Revolution Xbox Mix.

277
00:19:39,031 --> 00:19:42,716
[SPEAKER_24]: This is Xbox, because you can't have an Xbox mix, because that just sounds stupid.

278
00:19:44,598 --> 00:19:47,382
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think of this DDR Xbox mix?

279
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:56,294
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, considering that it looks like it has characters again, obviously, so I'm wondering if they're going to try to port the DDR PC version over to the Xbox, which I would like.

280
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,280
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll read this story.

281
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,321
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the official story coming from GamingHorizon.com.

282
00:20:03,322 --> 00:20:09,083
[SPEAKER_14]: It was only a matter of time until we saw the popular Dance Dance Revolution franchise scatter onto other consoles besides the PlayStation.

283
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:11,224
[SPEAKER_14]: DDR first started in the arcades.

284
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:17,826
[SPEAKER_14]: Electronic Boutique's website informs visitors of an upcoming DDR game from Konami entitled Dance Dance Revolution Xbox.

285
00:20:18,746 --> 00:20:28,794
[SPEAKER_14]: The game is supposedly going to contain all new songs, exclusive tracks for North America, Xbox Live integration so gamers can download more songs, characters, and dance steps.

286
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:29,435
[SPEAKER_14]: Characters!

287
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:37,494
[SPEAKER_14]: New game modes are also going to be implemented in that have never been seen before in other DDR titles.

288
00:20:38,274 --> 00:20:46,163
[SPEAKER_14]: Unfortunately, Economy of America hasn't sent out an official press release yet concerning this recent news, but we can almost guarantee to see something during E3 in May.

289
00:20:46,323 --> 00:20:48,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Will we get stuck with another diet mode?

290
00:20:48,525 --> 00:20:52,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that this has as much validity to it as 2DX USA.

291
00:20:54,258 --> 00:20:55,478
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know, it's got picture.

292
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:57,759
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't, I mean, pictures are truth, right?

293
00:20:58,079 --> 00:20:59,819
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, no one's ever faked a picture before.

294
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,800
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, wait.

295
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,740
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to dissent.

296
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,500
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's true.

297
00:21:04,701 --> 00:21:05,721
[SPEAKER_14]: I really think this is true.

298
00:21:06,621 --> 00:21:10,602
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I just don't, I don't see Electronics Boutique having that big of balls.

299
00:21:11,822 --> 00:21:12,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, did you fall on your head lately?

300
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:14,743
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

301
00:21:15,754 --> 00:21:17,615
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to know what I think is absolutely stupid?

302
00:21:18,135 --> 00:21:20,176
[SPEAKER_11]: DDR, Dance Dance Revolution, Xbox.

303
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,097
[SPEAKER_11]: They could have called it like DDRX or something.

304
00:21:22,137 --> 00:21:23,177
[SPEAKER_11]: So they call it Xbox.

305
00:21:23,478 --> 00:21:25,639
[SPEAKER_11]: As if it couldn't, as if, where's the imagination there?

306
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:26,939
[SPEAKER_14]: It could be a working title.

307
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's only for the Xbox.

308
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,661
[SPEAKER_14]: It's only for the Xbox.

309
00:21:32,068 --> 00:21:38,931
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you look at the box art, and I just posted a link in our chat room to this story, it says, only for Xbox.

310
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,791
[SPEAKER_14]: But this is probably that fake art.

311
00:21:40,851 --> 00:21:48,734
[SPEAKER_14]: You know how sometimes the big gaming stores, GameStop, EB, and all those, they do like the fake box art when they're taking pre-orders?

312
00:21:49,154 --> 00:21:55,137
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna go and draw just DDR Xbox and put it up on a site and say this is the official art.

313
00:21:55,517 --> 00:21:56,037
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all...

314
00:21:57,922 --> 00:22:01,244
[SPEAKER_04]: It's DDR on a non-PlayStation system.

315
00:22:02,024 --> 00:22:03,605
[SPEAKER_04]: And I loved my Dreamcast ones.

316
00:22:03,645 --> 00:22:04,345
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they're great.

317
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:07,206
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can't make edits and take them with you.

318
00:22:07,686 --> 00:22:08,987
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can't use paint mode.

319
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:10,688
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, paint.

320
00:22:11,168 --> 00:22:12,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Paint was like the best thing about Third Mix.

321
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:13,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.

322
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,051
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a big pile of stinky dog poo.

323
00:22:20,452 --> 00:22:23,153
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess we won't find out for sure until E3, but I don't know.

324
00:22:24,434 --> 00:22:26,615
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there's validity to it.

325
00:22:26,695 --> 00:22:26,975
[SPEAKER_14]: I just...

326
00:22:28,155 --> 00:22:28,915
[SPEAKER_14]: It makes sense.

327
00:22:29,736 --> 00:22:33,998
[SPEAKER_14]: Microsoft's really straggling right now to get something that's going to be successful for their system.

328
00:22:34,138 --> 00:22:41,101
[SPEAKER_14]: You get a really popular kind of growing thing like DDR, and there's going to be those obsessive freaks that will buy an Xbox just for this mix.

329
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:42,002
[SPEAKER_24]: I won't.

330
00:22:42,422 --> 00:22:45,323
[SPEAKER_14]: I won't either, but there will be obsessive freaks that will.

331
00:22:45,543 --> 00:22:46,084
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, I can't wait.

332
00:22:46,184 --> 00:22:46,944
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't wait.

333
00:22:47,544 --> 00:22:47,884
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't wait.

334
00:22:48,145 --> 00:22:48,425
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, wait.

335
00:22:48,585 --> 00:22:49,225
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, it sucks.

336
00:22:51,466 --> 00:22:53,167
[SPEAKER_04]: The Xbox is all about having Steel Battalion.

337
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:59,111
[SPEAKER_14]: So as the one person in this room who actually owns an Xbox, Jamie, what games are worth playing on the Xbox?

338
00:22:59,752 --> 00:23:01,872
[SPEAKER_11]: The game of throwing the Xbox at children.

339
00:23:03,573 --> 00:23:04,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Jet Set Radio Future.

340
00:23:04,353 --> 00:23:05,873
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

341
00:23:05,893 --> 00:23:06,734
[SPEAKER_04]: DOA Beach Volleyball.

342
00:23:07,194 --> 00:23:07,914
Boobie Ball.

343
00:23:07,934 --> 00:23:09,094
[SPEAKER_20]: I like the boobies.

344
00:23:09,114 --> 00:23:14,956
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing funnier than watching men decide trying to accessorize a swimsuit.

345
00:23:15,716 --> 00:23:18,017
[SPEAKER_24]: Fuck that, we're just trying to figure out how to take it off.

346
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:24,770
[SPEAKER_04]: DOA 3 was good, because I am a fighting game whore.

347
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, but like, let's look at some of their new games.

348
00:23:27,691 --> 00:23:28,931
[SPEAKER_11]: Fable, I'm looking forward to.

349
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:30,212
[SPEAKER_11]: Like Project Gotham Racing.

350
00:23:30,972 --> 00:23:31,572
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking forward to Fable.

351
00:23:31,632 --> 00:23:33,073
[SPEAKER_11]: If that wasn't a Midnight Club knockoff.

352
00:23:34,473 --> 00:23:47,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Fable is an RPG where you start off with him as a child, and you run through this character's life, and whatever decision that you make, like say you lose an eye, well after a while the people might start calling you Winky.

353
00:23:49,086 --> 00:23:49,588
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

354
00:23:52,927 --> 00:23:55,529
[SPEAKER_24]: What if you are without arms and legs?

355
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:56,770
[SPEAKER_24]: What would they call you then?

356
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:57,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Target.

357
00:23:59,692 --> 00:24:12,663
[SPEAKER_04]: But, like, they also have, like, if you, you know, kill, like, this whole family and leave, like, a child alive, the child can make it their life's quest to kill you, or they'll be afraid of you, or, you know, things like that.

358
00:24:12,803 --> 00:24:14,204
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, like, whatever decision that you make.

359
00:24:14,224 --> 00:24:19,288
[SPEAKER_24]: So can your priest character go and sexually molest other children and other families, and then they'll have issues later on in life?

360
00:24:20,129 --> 00:24:21,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it would work that way.

361
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:23,410
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, just checking.

362
00:24:24,591 --> 00:24:34,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I think it would be kind of neat, although I don't really like, you know, it's sort of like the typical American looking art for RPGs and the like.

363
00:24:34,713 --> 00:24:36,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really like how it looks.

364
00:24:37,213 --> 00:24:39,874
[SPEAKER_04]: But then again, I didn't like how Wind Waker looks in a sneak game.

365
00:24:40,154 --> 00:24:44,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, Link looks, you know, deformed and semi-retarded.

366
00:24:45,736 --> 00:24:48,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Then again, it's not really Link, so it doesn't matter.

367
00:24:51,438 --> 00:24:52,398
[SPEAKER_14]: What game is this again?

368
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:53,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Wind Waker.

369
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:55,399
[SPEAKER_14]: No, the one before that.

370
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:55,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Fable.

371
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:56,500
[SPEAKER_14]: Fable.

372
00:24:59,161 --> 00:24:59,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Fable.

373
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:05,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Japan Man, I think, said, what about Halo?

374
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo's pretty, but it makes me throw up.

375
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:10,902
[SPEAKER_24]: Halo sucks ass.

376
00:25:11,503 --> 00:25:12,724
[SPEAKER_24]: Halo sucks.

377
00:25:12,764 --> 00:25:13,665
[SPEAKER_24]: Because I say so.

378
00:25:14,426 --> 00:25:15,547
[SPEAKER_34]: Halo is not that bad.

379
00:25:15,727 --> 00:25:19,111
[SPEAKER_34]: It's good if you like a mindless adventure, shoot-em-up type.

380
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:20,452
[SPEAKER_14]: Where's my Duke Nukem Forever?

381
00:25:21,113 --> 00:25:22,314
[SPEAKER_14]: Say hello to the Ice Queen, by the way.

382
00:25:22,394 --> 00:25:22,854
[SPEAKER_34]: Oh yeah, hi.

383
00:25:24,249 --> 00:25:33,336
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm sorry, but Halo was alright, but I thought it got real repetitive after a while, and Halo 2 is just going to be just as bad, probably, except you can play it online, supposedly, yes or no.

384
00:25:33,856 --> 00:25:37,879
[SPEAKER_04]: I want them to take the first Doom and make it look really cool.

385
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:38,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

386
00:25:39,841 --> 00:25:40,742
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't want Doom 3.

387
00:25:41,162 --> 00:25:43,183
[SPEAKER_04]: I want the first Doom done really cool.

388
00:25:44,124 --> 00:25:45,585
[SPEAKER_04]: I want them to take Hexen.

389
00:25:46,706 --> 00:25:48,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Not Hexen 2, I want Hexen.

390
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:50,129
[SPEAKER_04]: I want them to do...

391
00:25:51,002 --> 00:25:55,523
[SPEAKER_04]: A sprite-based first-person shooter collection.

392
00:25:55,543 --> 00:25:56,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Chex Quest.

393
00:25:57,063 --> 00:25:58,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Best damn serial game ever.

394
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:01,384
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want it to work with the Steel Battalion controller.

395
00:26:02,044 --> 00:26:04,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Chex Quest.

396
00:26:04,745 --> 00:26:06,005
[SPEAKER_11]: He brought up Chex Quest.

397
00:26:06,085 --> 00:26:09,446
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want them to have level editors so I can play Gatchaman Quake.

398
00:26:11,986 --> 00:26:14,647
[SPEAKER_04]: They did a Gatchaman skin for Quake.

399
00:26:15,191 --> 00:26:20,752
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to figure out how to make a forest level for Counter-Strike so I can have the whole Battle Royale theme.

400
00:26:21,132 --> 00:26:22,873
[SPEAKER_11]: I have four characters made out of 40.

401
00:26:23,813 --> 00:26:25,013
[SPEAKER_04]: There's white cream on my shirt.

402
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:26,494
[SPEAKER_11]: No comment!

403
00:26:27,834 --> 00:26:33,075
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'd like to see... All I'm waiting for is the return to Castle Wolfenstein on the PS2.

404
00:26:33,095 --> 00:26:35,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Eh, why play it on PS2?

405
00:26:35,996 --> 00:26:37,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I don't want to play it on the computer.

406
00:26:37,536 --> 00:26:39,696
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll be... You can get all jaggedy edges!

407
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:41,517
[SPEAKER_04]: And motion blur!

408
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:46,317
[SPEAKER_24]: I like jaggedy edges in motion blur, I'll have you know.

409
00:26:47,938 --> 00:26:50,038
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, everybody hates motion blur because of the bouncer.

410
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:51,939
[SPEAKER_11]: It was nothing but one big blur.

411
00:26:53,219 --> 00:26:54,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Orphan was worse.

412
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Bouncer was stupid.

413
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,421
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted Orphan to be a good game.

414
00:26:58,461 --> 00:27:00,021
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually own it and have yet to play it.

415
00:27:01,042 --> 00:27:04,743
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted... Well, Dan got it for me because I'm a big Orphan fan.

416
00:27:04,943 --> 00:27:05,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the anime.

417
00:27:06,201 --> 00:27:11,246
[SPEAKER_34]: I was wondering about that, because I've played Orphan, the video game, and it was alright.

418
00:27:11,426 --> 00:27:15,611
[SPEAKER_34]: I mean, it was... Well, I wouldn't say it completely sucked, just because I'm like...

419
00:27:16,795 --> 00:27:18,236
[SPEAKER_34]: I don't know, it was okay.

420
00:27:18,396 --> 00:27:20,357
[SPEAKER_04]: I slacked off on collecting the DVDs.

421
00:27:20,517 --> 00:27:21,778
[SPEAKER_34]: But is the DVD worth watching?

422
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:22,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh god, the anime is awesome.

423
00:27:22,938 --> 00:27:23,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

424
00:27:23,178 --> 00:27:23,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

425
00:27:23,498 --> 00:27:27,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I've got like five Laserdiscs of the second series, Orphan Revenge.

426
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,001
[SPEAKER_04]: How many series are there?

427
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:28,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Two.

428
00:27:29,241 --> 00:27:30,682
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think there was OAVs, I think.

429
00:27:30,902 --> 00:27:31,802
[SPEAKER_34]: Did they make the box sets?

430
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:32,623
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes.

431
00:27:33,203 --> 00:27:33,683
[SPEAKER_34]: Yay!

432
00:27:33,763 --> 00:27:35,204
[SPEAKER_34]: Okay, now I have something to look forward to.

433
00:27:35,264 --> 00:27:41,027
[SPEAKER_04]: But, dude, well, Orphan's already, I think the whole series should be out now on DVD, but I've only got the first three.

434
00:27:41,567 --> 00:27:42,848
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally slacked off on it.

435
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:43,568
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Orphan.

436
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:44,709
[SPEAKER_19]: Cool.

437
00:27:45,925 --> 00:27:50,169
[SPEAKER_04]: I've played stuff from music from the series on one of my fuck-off shows before.

438
00:27:55,033 --> 00:27:56,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Anime Chat.

439
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:56,354
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi.

440
00:27:56,854 --> 00:27:58,916
[SPEAKER_14]: EOSFVB says, remember Commander Keen?

441
00:27:59,076 --> 00:28:00,077
[SPEAKER_14]: That game was the shit.

442
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:05,481
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the best game, except there were like a million sequels and it got redundant.

443
00:28:05,681 --> 00:28:06,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Jazz the Jackrabbit.

444
00:28:06,802 --> 00:28:07,323
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm sorry.

445
00:28:09,044 --> 00:28:12,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Commander Keen 4 was like better than like Super Nintendo.

446
00:28:12,907 --> 00:28:13,628
[SPEAKER_11]: Leisure Suit Larry.

447
00:28:15,257 --> 00:28:16,978
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, back to DDR on Xbox.

448
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:19,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, it's all about the crystal caves.

449
00:28:19,861 --> 00:28:21,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Who in here remembers Phantasmagoria?

450
00:28:23,303 --> 00:28:23,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

451
00:28:23,664 --> 00:28:26,266
[SPEAKER_04]: A game I never got to play.

452
00:28:27,947 --> 00:28:32,170
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I got to see the end of it, but Myst annoyed the hell out of me.

453
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,451
[SPEAKER_04]: I have Myst on Saturn.

454
00:28:34,172 --> 00:28:37,314
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I still have the discs for Phantasmagoria around here somewhere.

455
00:28:37,334 --> 00:28:38,355
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to have to find them for you.

456
00:28:42,029 --> 00:28:44,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone who has a Saturn, raise your hand.

457
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,771
[SPEAKER_04]: We own you.

458
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:46,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

459
00:28:48,712 --> 00:28:51,694
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll have access to... I have two Saturns also.

460
00:28:53,294 --> 00:28:53,775
[SPEAKER_04]: One's modded.

461
00:28:55,635 --> 00:28:56,756
[SPEAKER_04]: I have two styles of Saturns.

462
00:28:57,696 --> 00:29:03,939
[SPEAKER_11]: The only reason why Jamie always says, everybody who has this, raise your hand, because she has everything.

463
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:05,360
[SPEAKER_11]: She will always win.

464
00:29:06,374 --> 00:29:07,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a Jaguar.

465
00:29:07,935 --> 00:29:10,837
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have a crappy Jaguar, good, save yourself.

466
00:29:11,737 --> 00:29:15,739
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a Jaguar for the version of Tempest 2000 on it.

467
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you ever see Sean Baby's list of the 10 worst video games ever?

468
00:29:19,982 --> 00:29:20,182
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

469
00:29:20,262 --> 00:29:21,963
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, five of them are Jaguar games.

470
00:29:23,453 --> 00:29:26,535
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the others are the Zelda games on 3DO.

471
00:29:27,096 --> 00:29:29,257
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them was... It was the 3DO or CDI.

472
00:29:29,397 --> 00:29:32,740
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the worst game was, what, Gilligan's Island or something.

473
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:33,821
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

474
00:29:33,861 --> 00:29:34,601
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll pull up the list.

475
00:29:35,262 --> 00:29:37,763
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the worst one of the worst games ever is the version of E.T.

476
00:29:37,803 --> 00:29:38,664
[SPEAKER_04]: that's on the Atari 2600.

477
00:29:38,704 --> 00:29:39,405
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, that's it.

478
00:29:39,465 --> 00:29:39,945
[SPEAKER_14]: That was it.

479
00:29:40,225 --> 00:29:40,665
[SPEAKER_14]: That was it.

480
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:41,326
[SPEAKER_14]: It was the E.T.

481
00:29:41,386 --> 00:29:49,572
[SPEAKER_11]: on... Their whole little rumor is that there's like 2,300 cartridges buried out in like Mexico or something.

482
00:29:49,652 --> 00:29:50,533
[SPEAKER_14]: That is not a rumor.

483
00:29:51,673 --> 00:29:52,274
[SPEAKER_11]: It really isn't.

484
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:55,673
[SPEAKER_11]: Return to the green planet, or blue planet, or whatever it sounds like.

485
00:30:09,409 --> 00:30:12,010
[SPEAKER_04]: How about Return to My Butt?

486
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,971
[SPEAKER_14]: This is an interesting topic.

487
00:30:14,211 --> 00:30:17,393
[SPEAKER_14]: This is an interesting topic, so let's do this anyway.

488
00:30:17,433 --> 00:30:22,035
[SPEAKER_14]: This is Sean Baby's list of the 20 worst video games of all time.

489
00:30:22,095 --> 00:30:23,995
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to see if I own any of these.

490
00:30:24,716 --> 00:30:25,876
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on, we'll go through these one at a time.

491
00:30:27,337 --> 00:30:31,499
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm posting a link to SeanBaby.com slash NES slash EGM dot HTM.

492
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:32,459
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to run through these right now.

493
00:30:32,479 --> 00:30:32,459
20.

494
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,361
[SPEAKER_14]: Extreme Sports with the Bearstein Bears for Game Boy Color.

495
00:30:37,741 --> 00:30:37,882
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

496
00:30:39,282 --> 00:30:40,603
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my gosh, I remember that.

497
00:30:40,643 --> 00:30:44,525
[SPEAKER_11]: My little cousin had that, and I threw the Game Boy halfway across the room.

498
00:30:44,605 --> 00:30:46,246
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the worst thing ever.

499
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:52,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 19 is Bible Adventures for the NES.

500
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:57,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, in storage in Alabama, I do indeed own this game because I stole it.

501
00:30:57,923 --> 00:31:11,710
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just reading something in the back of the official PlayStation magazine, or I think it was PlayStation, or it was EGM, and they were talking about the Legend of Zelda that they converted into a Bible story.

502
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,671
[SPEAKER_11]: You didn't have a sword, you threw fruit.

503
00:31:14,531 --> 00:31:16,192
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're on this whole spiritual journey.

504
00:31:16,632 --> 00:31:16,993
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

505
00:31:17,133 --> 00:31:27,218
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a hack rom of the Zelda game on the Game Boy, the old Game Boy one, where he has a penis for a sword and goes around, you know, like Dildo Man or something.

506
00:31:28,832 --> 00:31:37,837
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, do remember that this article is probably about four years old that we're looking at, so I don't think it includes anything for GameCube, PlayStation 2, anything like that.

507
00:31:37,857 --> 00:31:38,398
[SPEAKER_04]: So next one.

508
00:31:38,698 --> 00:31:41,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Next one is, now this is great, and I think Jamie owns this.

509
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,441
[SPEAKER_04]: I do indeed own Criss Cross Make My Video.

510
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:46,742
[SPEAKER_04]: And you were there when I bought it.

511
00:31:46,762 --> 00:31:47,603
[SPEAKER_14]: I was there when she bought it.

512
00:31:47,963 --> 00:31:49,564
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought a brand new copy.

513
00:31:49,864 --> 00:31:50,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Toy Liquidators for $4.

514
00:31:50,945 --> 00:31:53,286
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, I thought that was the Marky Mark one I watched you buy.

515
00:31:53,766 --> 00:31:55,668
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that was the Marky Mark one, but I do own the Criss Cross one.

516
00:31:55,688 --> 00:31:55,968
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

517
00:31:55,988 --> 00:31:56,168
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

518
00:31:57,884 --> 00:31:59,465
[SPEAKER_24]: We need to play that on the show.

519
00:31:59,545 --> 00:32:00,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you gotta bring that in.

520
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:05,371
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I actually ended up giving the crisscross one to Dan's friend Eric, but... Get it back.

521
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:06,612
[SPEAKER_04]: He was way off in me.

522
00:32:06,932 --> 00:32:15,659
[SPEAKER_24]: We need to instate, like, Orange Lounge Extreme Challenge and have, like, you know, part of it to make the coolest video for, like... These are things we need to bring to B3.

523
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:22,287
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to go and buy all these games and see who can stand to play them.

524
00:32:22,347 --> 00:32:23,387
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll bring the Marky Mark one.

525
00:32:23,487 --> 00:32:25,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll bring my CDX and the Marky Mark one.

526
00:32:25,187 --> 00:32:25,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, God.

527
00:32:26,788 --> 00:32:29,849
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 17, Bubsy 3D for the PlayStation.

528
00:32:30,769 --> 00:32:32,570
[SPEAKER_14]: As if Bubsy 1 wasn't crap enough.

529
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:32,810
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

530
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:33,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyone ever play Bubsy?

531
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,150
[SPEAKER_24]: I played Bubsy.

532
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:35,791
[SPEAKER_24]: I played Bubsy.

533
00:32:35,931 --> 00:32:36,911
[SPEAKER_24]: And Bubsy 2.

534
00:32:37,471 --> 00:32:38,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Holy shit.

535
00:32:39,112 --> 00:32:40,252
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a fun game.

536
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:44,201
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 16 is Bad Street Brawler for the NES.

537
00:32:44,641 --> 00:32:47,283
[SPEAKER_14]: That game was shit.

538
00:32:47,444 --> 00:32:54,289
[SPEAKER_14]: The only game I can think of that was worse than Bad Street Brawler, and it's not on this list so I can say it, was that fucking Bayou Billy.

539
00:32:54,549 --> 00:32:55,830
[SPEAKER_14]: I did not like that game at all.

540
00:32:59,562 --> 00:33:01,803
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 15 is Total Recall for the NES.

541
00:33:02,003 --> 00:33:02,863
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to have that game.

542
00:33:03,943 --> 00:33:05,004
[SPEAKER_04]: I threw it down the stairs.

543
00:33:05,744 --> 00:33:08,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a picture of the three-titted chick here on SeanBaby's site.

544
00:33:09,745 --> 00:33:10,845
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll tell you the worst one.

545
00:33:11,105 --> 00:33:11,405
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on.

546
00:33:11,665 --> 00:33:12,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it on there?

547
00:33:12,606 --> 00:33:14,106
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to go through one.

548
00:33:14,146 --> 00:33:15,166
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I know before I say it.

549
00:33:15,546 --> 00:33:16,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, no.

550
00:33:16,147 --> 00:33:20,708
[SPEAKER_11]: The worst Arnold Schwarzenegger-based game was Predator on the NES.

551
00:33:20,768 --> 00:33:21,668
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember Predator.

552
00:33:21,808 --> 00:33:23,049
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, it was bad.

553
00:33:23,229 --> 00:33:24,869
[SPEAKER_11]: You couldn't even jump when you needed to.

554
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:26,249
[SPEAKER_11]: He'd, like, jump on his own.

555
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Do everything on his own.

556
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:28,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my God.

557
00:33:29,311 --> 00:33:37,764
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 14, Rap Jam, Volume 1 You could play Queen Latifah vs. Coolio

558
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:40,455
[SPEAKER_14]: all in a big game of basketball.

559
00:33:40,676 --> 00:33:41,937
[SPEAKER_30]: Dude, I'd play as Queen Latifah.

560
00:33:41,957 --> 00:33:42,577
[SPEAKER_30]: That's cool.

561
00:33:42,597 --> 00:33:47,461
[SPEAKER_14]: And they say, it says here on Sean Baby's site, Queen Latifah looks like a 130-pound Mexican boy.

562
00:33:47,481 --> 00:33:50,444
[SPEAKER_29]: Alright, next.

563
00:33:50,624 --> 00:33:53,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 13 was Air Cars for the Jaguar.

564
00:33:54,006 --> 00:33:54,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, no.

565
00:33:54,527 --> 00:33:55,468
[SPEAKER_14]: Looks like a piece of poo.

566
00:33:55,788 --> 00:33:58,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 12, I think Jamie owns this, Night Trap.

567
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:58,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

568
00:34:00,111 --> 00:34:02,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I want the 32X one.

569
00:34:03,554 --> 00:34:05,716
[SPEAKER_14]: Night Trap starring drug-induced Dana Plato.

570
00:34:05,776 --> 00:34:06,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, Night Trap is neat.

571
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:09,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Star Trap, I'm sorry, Night Trap was neat.

572
00:34:09,243 --> 00:34:13,025
[SPEAKER_11]: Night Trap was good, it was like the first real controversial game out there.

573
00:34:13,346 --> 00:34:24,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Night Trap required intelligence to play it, because you had to know what, you monitor your things and everything, but we've actually, you can download an FAQ that tells you when to watch each camera.

574
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,993
[SPEAKER_24]: I want a new version of Maniac Mansion.

575
00:34:27,234 --> 00:34:27,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes!

576
00:34:28,294 --> 00:34:29,895
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, I always made the house explode.

577
00:34:29,915 --> 00:34:31,376
[SPEAKER_14]: Didn't they have a Maniac Mansion cartoon?

578
00:34:32,318 --> 00:34:32,998
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a TV show.

579
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,679
[SPEAKER_24]: That was a TV, yeah, live action TV show.

580
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,340
[SPEAKER_04]: On the family.

581
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,901
[SPEAKER_24]: I have, I have the data tentacle and that was funny.

582
00:34:37,921 --> 00:34:40,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Monster in my pocket.

583
00:34:41,143 --> 00:34:41,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

584
00:34:41,244 --> 00:34:43,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Monster in my pocket before there was Pokemon.

585
00:34:43,725 --> 00:34:47,107
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, we're going down Sean Baby's list of the 20 worst games of all time.

586
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:47,227
[SPEAKER_14]: No!

587
00:34:47,287 --> 00:34:49,989
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a couple years old.

588
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:51,650
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Dragonlance.

589
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,952
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 11 is Dragonlance, Heroes of the Lance.

590
00:34:55,913 --> 00:34:56,833
[SPEAKER_04]: I want that game.

591
00:34:56,893 --> 00:34:58,254
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't even remember this game.

592
00:34:58,274 --> 00:34:59,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I love the books.

593
00:34:59,915 --> 00:35:01,176
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care if the game sucks.

594
00:35:02,593 --> 00:35:05,174
[SPEAKER_34]: It sucks, it makes a complete mockery of the books.

595
00:35:05,294 --> 00:35:09,035
[SPEAKER_04]: I had one of the Dragonlance PC games that came on, the big-ass floppy disks.

596
00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:12,696
[SPEAKER_34]: I've never seen the PC version, I've only seen that version and that, no.

597
00:35:14,336 --> 00:35:15,537
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah, because I read all the Dragonlance games.

598
00:35:15,597 --> 00:35:23,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this one I absolutely agree with, because the home versions, even down to the Saturn version, sucked so much ass, Revolution X.

599
00:35:24,548 --> 00:35:26,348
[SPEAKER_14]: Aerosmith, Stars in Revolution X

600
00:35:48,534 --> 00:35:52,760
[SPEAKER_11]: I gotta say though, the Super NES version was better than the PC version.

601
00:35:53,261 --> 00:35:54,662
[SPEAKER_11]: The PC version was worse.

602
00:35:58,462 --> 00:35:59,123
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 9.

603
00:36:00,344 --> 00:36:01,284
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie, do you have this one?

604
00:36:01,324 --> 00:36:02,285
[SPEAKER_14]: Custer's Revenge.

605
00:36:02,805 --> 00:36:03,666
[SPEAKER_04]: I have ROM of this.

606
00:36:03,686 --> 00:36:05,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan has ROM of this.

607
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:08,410
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think a lot of people have the ROM, but nobody has the actual cartridge that we know.

608
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:16,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Come to think of it, I may actually have, we have a ROM chip player for 2600, and I think we actually may have the ROM chip for this.

609
00:36:16,836 --> 00:36:21,700
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, for those that don't know what Custer's Revenge is, the way it works is you play Custer.

610
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,061
[SPEAKER_14]: You can fuck a skull.

611
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:27,344
[SPEAKER_14]: Your job is to fuck this woman with a feather in her hat.

612
00:36:28,525 --> 00:36:29,485
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, over and over again.

613
00:36:29,505 --> 00:36:30,426
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a dildo on her head.

614
00:36:30,846 --> 00:36:32,207
[SPEAKER_14]: Or it's a dildo on her head, I don't know.

615
00:36:32,227 --> 00:36:32,787
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that caption.

616
00:36:32,807 --> 00:36:34,287
[SPEAKER_14]: And you have to dodge the falling arrows.

617
00:36:34,528 --> 00:36:35,288
[SPEAKER_11]: I like the caption.

618
00:36:35,468 --> 00:36:38,409
[SPEAKER_11]: It says, erotic imagery, I've masturbated to sexier Legos.

619
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:41,530
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

620
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, X-Man is not on this.

621
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,321
[SPEAKER_14]: What's X-Man?

622
00:36:45,021 --> 00:36:51,308
[SPEAKER_04]: X-Man was this one where you play as this little, he looks like scissors except it's a guy with a big dick the size of his body.

623
00:36:52,029 --> 00:36:58,916
[SPEAKER_04]: And you walk through a maze and then when you get to the center of the maze and avoid the traps, you like have to, there's this woman on all fours and you have to bone her.

624
00:37:01,624 --> 00:37:04,566
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 8, White Men Can't Jump for the Jaguar.

625
00:37:04,746 --> 00:37:05,386
[SPEAKER_04]: God, no.

626
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:07,767
[SPEAKER_14]: Whoop, there it is.

627
00:37:09,548 --> 00:37:10,349
[SPEAKER_24]: I hate that game.

628
00:37:10,409 --> 00:37:15,131
[SPEAKER_24]: I haven't played it because I got flack for my last name because of that stupid movie.

629
00:37:16,152 --> 00:37:16,892
[SPEAKER_24]: God damn it.

630
00:37:19,054 --> 00:37:21,015
[SPEAKER_14]: Number 7, Superman 64.

631
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:23,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Played it, never got it.

632
00:37:24,377 --> 00:37:25,597
[SPEAKER_04]: It had potential to be cool.

633
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:28,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, that looks like Star Fox level, though.

634
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:30,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it looks like Star Fox.

635
00:37:31,261 --> 00:37:34,183
[SPEAKER_14]: Number six, Zelda, The Wand of Gamelon.

636
00:37:34,323 --> 00:37:34,943
[SPEAKER_14]: CDI!

637
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:43,609
[SPEAKER_14]: This was the one that they made for the CDI, where if you thought Link looked like shit in Wind Waker, you have not seen a shitty cartoon Link.

638
00:37:44,589 --> 00:37:47,471
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I just want to know who got fired for this.

639
00:37:48,412 --> 00:37:50,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Zelda looks rather wanton right there.

640
00:37:50,173 --> 00:37:51,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at her expression with her mouth open.

641
00:37:53,915 --> 00:37:57,217
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks like Princess Zelda in this picture is about to give somebody head.

642
00:37:58,138 --> 00:37:59,999
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the designs from the cartoon series.

643
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,982
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, yeah, it's so good.

644
00:38:03,002 --> 00:38:05,363
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, excuse me, princess.

645
00:38:05,704 --> 00:38:07,545
[SPEAKER_24]: Why is Link being played by Prince?

646
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:10,487
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all I want to know.

647
00:38:11,408 --> 00:38:13,009
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, number five.

648
00:38:13,029 --> 00:38:13,889
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not Link anymore.

649
00:38:13,949 --> 00:38:15,630
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like an ocarina.

650
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,731
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like what his symbol is.

651
00:38:16,831 --> 00:38:18,993
[SPEAKER_14]: A game for the 3DO called Virtuoso.

652
00:38:19,033 --> 00:38:19,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Virtuoso.

653
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:20,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God, no.

654
00:38:21,114 --> 00:38:23,936
[SPEAKER_24]: Being played by... Oh, shit.

655
00:38:24,036 --> 00:38:25,517
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, man, I don't know.

656
00:38:29,205 --> 00:38:30,626
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it says who did it.

657
00:38:31,486 --> 00:38:32,467
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess it was nobody famous.

658
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:36,650
[SPEAKER_14]: Number four is a game called Captain Novolin.

659
00:38:37,111 --> 00:38:37,411
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

660
00:38:37,731 --> 00:38:38,032
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it on?

661
00:38:38,052 --> 00:38:40,614
[SPEAKER_14]: Which is, it's a game about diabetes.

662
00:38:43,836 --> 00:38:48,220
[SPEAKER_14]: It was put together not to educate children about diabetes, but to blatantly taunt their disease.

663
00:38:51,087 --> 00:38:54,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I've played better flash games than what this looks like.

664
00:38:54,488 --> 00:39:04,170
[SPEAKER_04]: There's this flash game about sexually transmitted diseases, and you have to catch the jizz in a condom.

665
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,371
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a flash game.

666
00:39:07,651 --> 00:39:13,472
[SPEAKER_14]: This helpful nurse will come out and say, you need to check your blood sugar four times a day, but you can check it more often if you like.

667
00:39:14,386 --> 00:39:15,067
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a helpful point.

668
00:39:15,087 --> 00:39:16,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to stick a needle in my finger.

669
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:18,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, let me do it 20 times a day.

670
00:39:19,474 --> 00:39:19,594
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

671
00:39:19,834 --> 00:39:22,398
[SPEAKER_14]: Diabetes is nothing to joke about, but that's why this game is so bad.

672
00:39:22,499 --> 00:39:24,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's not, but still, it's rather wrong.

673
00:39:24,822 --> 00:39:25,924
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why this game is bad.

674
00:39:27,421 --> 00:39:28,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Fight4Life Fight4Life Fight4Life

675
00:39:58,792 --> 00:40:00,032
[SPEAKER_04]: I own this game and it's... Awesome, man!

676
00:40:28,151 --> 00:40:32,574
[SPEAKER_33]: Freakin' awesome, he just made the eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, the whole game.

677
00:40:34,176 --> 00:40:39,420
[SPEAKER_33]: Although I would actually... I'm gonna make a t-shirt with the E.T.

678
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:43,043
[SPEAKER_04]: sprite and a big anti-thing.

679
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,204
[SPEAKER_24]: Don't be dogging E.T.

680
00:40:45,224 --> 00:40:48,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a shirt with the dragon on it.

681
00:40:48,307 --> 00:40:51,609
[SPEAKER_14]: We should open up an Orange Lounge store that sells these things.

682
00:40:51,989 --> 00:40:53,751
[SPEAKER_14]: One of those crappy cafe e-press stores.

683
00:40:57,853 --> 00:40:58,153
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

684
00:40:58,954 --> 00:41:09,579
[SPEAKER_14]: I think what we're going to do at this point, did everybody get off their chest what they wanted to say about DDR on the Xbox and all?

685
00:41:09,919 --> 00:41:11,019
[SPEAKER_24]: I think they picked up on the mic.

686
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,881
[SPEAKER_14]: A quick question for you guys.

687
00:41:13,901 --> 00:41:18,643
[SPEAKER_14]: We're getting asked by the chat room about this, and I said yes, because I know at least I'll be here.

688
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:20,204
[SPEAKER_14]: Next Sunday is Easter.

689
00:41:20,424 --> 00:41:21,404
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we still doing a show?

690
00:41:21,764 --> 00:41:22,164
[SPEAKER_24]: Hell yeah.

691
00:41:22,184 --> 00:41:23,505
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't do anything for Easter.

692
00:41:23,685 --> 00:41:25,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Does anybody have to celebrate Easter?

693
00:41:26,269 --> 00:41:27,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Only if I get to burn something.

694
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:30,930
[SPEAKER_24]: Easter's really about the eggs.

695
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:32,751
[SPEAKER_24]: Who gives a crap about this Jesus shit?

696
00:41:32,771 --> 00:41:35,372
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to be celebrating Easter.

697
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:36,892
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to celebrate my birthday.

698
00:41:37,832 --> 00:41:38,133
[SPEAKER_14]: Huh?

699
00:41:38,613 --> 00:41:39,513
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right, you guys.

700
00:41:39,613 --> 00:41:41,073
[SPEAKER_14]: Next Sunday is Jamie's birthday.

701
00:41:41,093 --> 00:41:44,134
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not the day after my birthday.

702
00:41:44,214 --> 00:41:44,594
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, that's right.

703
00:41:44,614 --> 00:41:45,255
[SPEAKER_14]: Today's the 13th.

704
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:45,615
[SPEAKER_14]: Never mind.

705
00:41:45,895 --> 00:41:46,195
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.

706
00:41:47,035 --> 00:41:48,015
[SPEAKER_14]: But that means next week is 420!

707
00:41:48,055 --> 00:41:48,476
[SPEAKER_14]: Whoop-a-dee-doo.

708
00:41:54,327 --> 00:41:54,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Good for you.

709
00:41:55,067 --> 00:41:55,988
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you a pothead?

710
00:41:59,588 --> 00:42:00,809
[SPEAKER_14]: I know someone who is.

711
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:05,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, yeah, we'll be here next week.

712
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:08,351
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, where did 420 come from?

713
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:09,571
[SPEAKER_14]: 420 is the police code.

714
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:11,712
[SPEAKER_14]: You know how there's all these police codes for different crimes?

715
00:42:12,492 --> 00:42:14,092
[SPEAKER_14]: 420 is smoking marijuana.

716
00:42:14,112 --> 00:42:14,512
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got a 1337.

717
00:42:15,093 --> 00:42:18,573
[SPEAKER_14]: I wonder what a 1337 is in police code.

718
00:42:19,394 --> 00:42:20,594
[SPEAKER_04]: I call a homestar run or break.

719
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:22,311
[SPEAKER_14]: A Homestar Runner, right?

720
00:42:23,193 --> 00:42:24,235
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to do a Homestar Runner, right?

721
00:42:24,476 --> 00:42:25,999
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you bring some on your CD here?

722
00:42:31,494 --> 00:42:32,615
[SPEAKER_24]: And now, more sounds of E.T.

723
00:42:33,776 --> 00:42:35,337
[SPEAKER_14]: In two weeks, however, we'll be taped.

724
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,801
[SPEAKER_14]: Why are you sending me to Homestar Runner?

725
00:42:57,035 --> 00:42:58,396
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, okay.

726
00:42:59,698 --> 00:43:00,839
[SPEAKER_14]: I have no idea what Jamie's doing.

727
00:43:00,859 --> 00:43:03,581
[SPEAKER_14]: She just took over my computer and she's loading up stuff on the Star Runner.

728
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:07,204
[SPEAKER_11]: On my computer, I have it loaded to where it'll start up.

729
00:43:07,244 --> 00:43:09,987
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll say, Hello, stupid, and welcome to your crappy computer.

730
00:43:11,268 --> 00:43:11,848
[SPEAKER_11]: I want that.

731
00:43:12,629 --> 00:43:14,871
[SPEAKER_11]: I can send you the MP3 if you really want it.

732
00:43:15,031 --> 00:43:15,451
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool.

733
00:43:15,932 --> 00:43:18,174
[SPEAKER_11]: It's from, it's Strong Bad saying it, so it's pretty cool.

734
00:43:21,717 --> 00:43:21,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Um.

735
00:43:22,397 --> 00:43:22,758
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, dear.

736
00:43:22,778 --> 00:43:22,818
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh.

737
00:43:37,803 --> 00:43:40,105
[SPEAKER_28]: Why don't you and the Chief pull a caper of some sort?

738
00:43:40,506 --> 00:43:43,808
[SPEAKER_28]: It seems like there's been little cooperation between the two of you as of late.

739
00:43:44,209 --> 00:43:45,630
[SPEAKER_28]: James, Detroit me.

740
00:43:46,651 --> 00:43:47,431
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, you're right.

741
00:43:48,172 --> 00:43:54,057
[SPEAKER_28]: And it's no secret that the Chief and I haven't been getting along very well since he screwed up our last caper.

742
00:43:54,997 --> 00:43:56,539
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't care about the crosswords, man.

743
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:57,960
[SPEAKER_28]: Just the jumbles, the jumbles.

744
00:43:59,342 --> 00:44:00,483
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know, go look over there!

745
00:44:02,203 --> 00:44:02,604
[SPEAKER_28]: Look out!

746
00:44:03,204 --> 00:44:04,084
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, great, man!

747
00:44:06,845 --> 00:44:12,147
[SPEAKER_26]: He's too upset, Batman.

748
00:44:12,968 --> 00:44:14,188
[SPEAKER_26]: What are you guys doing in my house?

749
00:44:14,528 --> 00:44:15,329
[SPEAKER_28]: We've been ID'd!

750
00:44:15,649 --> 00:44:16,589
[SPEAKER_28]: Every man for himself!

751
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:19,951
[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks for stopping by, you guys.

752
00:44:21,351 --> 00:44:22,832
[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks for breaking my cowlamp.

753
00:44:24,152 --> 00:44:25,033
[SPEAKER_28]: The Chief, man.

754
00:44:26,913 --> 00:44:28,014
[SPEAKER_28]: Where did we go wrong?

755
00:44:30,069 --> 00:44:33,550
[SPEAKER_28]: Seems like just yesterday we were setting fire to Strong Sad's underwears.

756
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:34,370
[SPEAKER_28]: How was yesterday?

757
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:35,211
[SPEAKER_28]: This one's for you.

758
00:44:36,291 --> 00:44:42,753
[SPEAKER_28]: I got mad at the cheat for screwing up the jumbled paper.

759
00:44:46,054 --> 00:44:51,876
[SPEAKER_28]: I hope I don't see his name in the paper in the obituaries.

760
00:44:52,496 --> 00:44:56,338
[SPEAKER_28]: His dad would mean he's dead if he is not dead.

761
00:44:58,084 --> 00:45:24,673
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm so glad the cheetah's not dead, the cheetah's not dead Oh, I'm so glad the cheetah's not dead, the cheetah's not dead So glad the cheetah's not dead Just the claps, just the claps Wrong time, I didn't know you had any rhythm Oh sure, I got tons of rhythm You got the clap Keep it rollin' for me guys, keep it rollin'

762
00:45:29,173 --> 00:45:31,456
[SPEAKER_28]: DJ, I just wanted to say that.

763
00:45:32,136 --> 00:45:34,018
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, I can't stay mad at you.

764
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,882
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, how about a little kick for old time's sake?

765
00:45:38,203 --> 00:45:40,625
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'll have your skin, man.

766
00:45:41,626 --> 00:45:42,007
[SPEAKER_28]: What's that?

767
00:45:42,087 --> 00:45:43,228
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, what are we now?

768
00:45:43,328 --> 00:45:45,470
[SPEAKER_28]: I had you there.

769
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:54,943
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

770
00:45:57,064 --> 00:46:03,706
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so, uh, yeah, that was, that was HomestarRunner.com, and I'm still convinced they're gonna sell out to the car- You guys are so cute.

771
00:46:05,446 --> 00:46:07,507
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh- I could probably get dressed or something.

772
00:46:07,967 --> 00:46:10,007
[SPEAKER_26]: What is it, like, three in the afternoon?

773
00:46:11,008 --> 00:46:12,528
[SPEAKER_26]: Looking good, Homestar.

774
00:46:13,268 --> 00:46:14,128
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, what's the deal?

775
00:46:14,489 --> 00:46:15,709
[SPEAKER_26]: I didn't know you had to shave.

776
00:46:16,189 --> 00:46:16,769
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, I don't.

777
00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:17,950
[SPEAKER_26]: It's cinnamon.

778
00:46:21,571 --> 00:46:21,831
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

779
00:46:22,351 --> 00:46:23,051
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, um-

780
00:46:27,108 --> 00:46:28,068
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, yes, hi.

781
00:46:29,689 --> 00:46:34,471
[SPEAKER_14]: Strong Bad, I still say that they're going to sell out to Cartoon Network within a matter of months.

782
00:46:34,752 --> 00:46:35,332
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll bet you anything.

783
00:46:38,653 --> 00:46:40,294
[SPEAKER_14]: We are now going to take a break.

784
00:46:40,874 --> 00:46:42,975
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that was kind of a break, but we're going to take a real break here.

785
00:46:43,195 --> 00:46:48,058
[SPEAKER_14]: And you guys, I know you've been anticipating this for a long, long time.

786
00:46:48,898 --> 00:46:52,880
[SPEAKER_14]: Two weeks ago, during March Madness, we had the world debut of...

787
00:46:53,775 --> 00:46:57,318
[SPEAKER_14]: of Kyle Snyder's song, I Could Never Be Japanese.

788
00:46:57,378 --> 00:47:00,000
[SPEAKER_14]: And you guys, tonight, here it is again.

789
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:01,601
[SPEAKER_04]: I will take this as an opportunity to go poop.

790
00:47:04,203 --> 00:47:06,645
[SPEAKER_14]: So, this is it.

791
00:47:06,765 --> 00:47:07,206
[SPEAKER_14]: This is it.

792
00:47:07,246 --> 00:47:08,046
[SPEAKER_14]: The world premiere.

793
00:47:08,147 --> 00:47:11,329
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the second premiere, I guess, because we already did this once.

794
00:47:11,349 --> 00:47:11,869
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to do it again.

795
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:19,836
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a clip from March Madness of Kyle Snyder singing his new song, I Could Never Be Japanese.

796
00:47:20,596 --> 00:47:21,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Enjoy, you guys.

797
00:47:22,947 --> 00:47:51,016
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember when I was young It would come every Saturday evening I would watch some Japanese TV It never did get boring It was all I cared about There was nothing else for me to do Then I suddenly hit reality And a message came through

798
00:47:52,273 --> 00:48:17,462
[SPEAKER_12]: I could never be Japanese No matter what it would never be Even though I never gave up hope I had to face reality I thought it would all end there But somehow I kept going on I'm so interested in Japanese culture

799
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:42,804
[SPEAKER_12]: That is why I wrote this song If it weren't for my brother I wouldn't know much about your culture I would be so ignorant It would be pure torture I'm sure there are others

800
00:48:43,479 --> 00:49:11,862
[SPEAKER_12]: Who are into Japanese culture too I'm glad I'm not the only one Otherwise I'd probably be a fool I could never be Japanese No matter what it would never be Even though I never gave up hope I had to face reality I thought it would all end there

801
00:49:12,631 --> 00:49:40,570
[SPEAKER_12]: Yet somehow I kept going on I'm so interested in Japanese culture That is why I wrote this song There was much I didn't know That I learned as the time flew by I was shocked about what I learned I didn't know why

802
00:49:41,468 --> 00:50:08,579
[SPEAKER_12]: Then it started to come to me Why I wasn't born in Japan Life would be too hard for me It must be part of the Lord's plan I could never be Japanese No matter what, it would never be Even though I never gave up hope I had to face reality

803
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:37,298
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought it would all end there But somehow I kept going on I'm so interested in Japanese culture And that is why I wrote this song I could never be Japanese No matter what it would never be Even though I never gave up hope

804
00:50:38,035 --> 00:51:00,712
[SPEAKER_12]: I had to face reality I thought it would all end there Yet somehow I kept going on I'm still interested in Japanese culture And that is why I wrote this song

805
00:51:37,908 --> 00:51:39,009
[SPEAKER_23]: This is fucked up!

806
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:39,610
This is fucked up!

807
00:53:54,071 --> 00:54:03,053
[SPEAKER_32]: And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite perverse Bomani band, Erotic.

808
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:04,393
[SPEAKER_31]: Do it all night.

809
00:54:04,634 --> 00:54:05,514
[SPEAKER_31]: Do it with me.

810
00:54:05,954 --> 00:54:07,394
[SPEAKER_21]: No, no, that was awful.

811
00:54:07,474 --> 00:54:08,334
[SPEAKER_21]: Bloody terrible.

812
00:54:08,394 --> 00:54:09,735
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you take vocal lessons?

813
00:54:09,815 --> 00:54:10,795
[SPEAKER_21]: Kill your teacher.

814
00:54:11,275 --> 00:54:12,295
[SPEAKER_21]: In the heat of the night.

815
00:54:12,755 --> 00:54:14,856
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.

816
00:54:16,036 --> 00:54:16,696
[SPEAKER_19]: I liked it.

817
00:54:17,216 --> 00:54:18,757
[SPEAKER_21]: Shut the bloody hell up, Paula.

818
00:54:18,877 --> 00:54:19,297
[SPEAKER_21]: Next.

819
00:54:22,412 --> 00:54:24,154
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, that was cool.

820
00:54:24,994 --> 00:54:26,776
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you even know why you're here?

821
00:54:26,856 --> 00:54:28,558
[SPEAKER_21]: That was just bloody pathetic.

822
00:54:28,618 --> 00:54:29,099
[SPEAKER_21]: Next!

823
00:54:32,042 --> 00:54:33,484
[SPEAKER_25]: Come on, do it with me.

824
00:54:34,465 --> 00:54:35,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes, that's it!

825
00:54:36,066 --> 00:54:37,228
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a winner!

826
00:54:38,029 --> 00:54:41,893
[SPEAKER_32]: A Star is Born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

827
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:45,472
[SPEAKER_14]: A star is born on Orange Lounge Radio

828
00:55:05,436 --> 00:55:09,437
[SPEAKER_11]: He was sitting there, like, staring at me while I was singing, and I'm trying not to laugh.

829
00:55:09,497 --> 00:55:11,097
[SPEAKER_11]: My face is absolutely bright red.

830
00:55:11,658 --> 00:55:12,258
[SPEAKER_11]: And he walks away.

831
00:55:12,278 --> 00:55:14,798
[SPEAKER_11]: I dropped the microphone and bursted into laughter.

832
00:55:16,259 --> 00:55:16,919
[SPEAKER_11]: It was so bad.

833
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:18,679
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why he got interrupted the first time.

834
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,000
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

835
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,381
[SPEAKER_14]: The studio's just erupted into chaos because we just had arriving.

836
00:55:25,401 --> 00:55:26,641
[SPEAKER_14]: We have Dark Childs in the house.

837
00:55:26,681 --> 00:55:27,021
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay.

838
00:55:27,441 --> 00:55:29,222
[SPEAKER_06]: D-Child in the heezy-fush-heezy.

839
00:55:29,935 --> 00:55:31,276
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura will fuck you up, Mixx

840
00:56:00,317 --> 00:56:02,379
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody should fuck someone up for that last song.

841
00:56:02,439 --> 00:56:08,783
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, Gamlande Couple, which we're finally starting to get... We're starting to get some feedback in the chatroom that, you know what, you guys?

842
00:56:09,304 --> 00:56:10,765
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe that's overplayed a little bit.

843
00:56:10,925 --> 00:56:11,585
[SPEAKER_14]: You think so?

844
00:56:11,605 --> 00:56:13,847
[SPEAKER_14]: You think that song's overplayed or what?

845
00:56:14,207 --> 00:56:14,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

846
00:56:15,688 --> 00:56:17,490
[SPEAKER_11]: It's back all over again, everybody.

847
00:56:18,504 --> 00:56:20,625
[SPEAKER_14]: I have never, ever had one of these before.

848
00:56:20,645 --> 00:56:20,965
[SPEAKER_14]: What do I do?

849
00:56:20,985 --> 00:56:21,885
[SPEAKER_14]: Do I push the marble in?

850
00:56:22,405 --> 00:56:22,625
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

851
00:56:23,586 --> 00:56:25,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you take the plastic off?

852
00:56:25,506 --> 00:56:26,446
[SPEAKER_11]: I took the plastic thing off.

853
00:56:26,646 --> 00:56:28,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, there should be a green thing in there.

854
00:56:28,547 --> 00:56:28,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh.

855
00:56:28,887 --> 00:56:38,590
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, well, now it's not, but... Love the lovely stuff of Orange Lodge.

856
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:39,530
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm getting a lesson.

857
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:40,811
[SPEAKER_11]: You take your thingy off.

858
00:56:42,651 --> 00:56:43,211
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

859
00:56:43,251 --> 00:56:43,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool!

860
00:56:48,413 --> 00:56:53,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's... They do... No, I don't want to see that!

861
00:56:54,774 --> 00:56:55,014
[SPEAKER_31]: What?

862
00:56:55,094 --> 00:56:57,535
[SPEAKER_31]: I haven't followed it for a season.

863
00:56:57,575 --> 00:56:58,295
[SPEAKER_31]: What is this?

864
00:56:59,155 --> 00:57:01,215
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody use your imagination at home.

865
00:57:01,295 --> 00:57:02,415
[SPEAKER_11]: I stuck it in my mouth.

866
00:57:02,535 --> 00:57:05,476
[SPEAKER_11]: Or better not, don't use your imagination at home.

867
00:57:07,496 --> 00:57:09,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob just didn't want to get it on the floor.

868
00:57:12,317 --> 00:57:13,757
[SPEAKER_14]: You know I just had to lick that all up.

869
00:57:15,478 --> 00:57:17,178
[SPEAKER_24]: Better to let it shoot off in your mouth, right?

870
00:57:19,406 --> 00:57:20,046
[SPEAKER_14]: No, oh my god.

871
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:25,950
[SPEAKER_14]: My friend Garrett, earlier this week, he took me to... What's that Japanese store?

872
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:26,551
[SPEAKER_14]: It's in South Side.

873
00:57:26,611 --> 00:57:27,571
[SPEAKER_14]: Ototo's, I think it's called?

874
00:57:29,844 --> 00:57:30,985
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's what the place was called.

875
00:57:31,125 --> 00:57:35,987
[SPEAKER_14]: It's over on... And I apologize for those out of Sacramento who aren't going to get this.

876
00:57:36,367 --> 00:57:39,929
[SPEAKER_14]: It's on Fruit Ridge and... Fruit Ridge and what's the other after?

877
00:57:39,949 --> 00:57:40,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Freeport.

878
00:57:40,569 --> 00:57:41,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Freeport and Fruit Ridge.

879
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:43,391
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, that's like a mile away from my house.

880
00:57:43,511 --> 00:57:47,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, they have... If you're not in a car, don't go throughout the area.

881
00:57:47,813 --> 00:57:48,333
[SPEAKER_11]: You will die.

882
00:57:49,134 --> 00:57:49,514
[SPEAKER_14]: I am done.

883
00:57:51,055 --> 00:57:54,676
[SPEAKER_14]: We went and we got that and... There was a reason I was telling this story.

884
00:57:54,736 --> 00:57:57,818
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yes, he bought the explosive Hello Kitty drink.

885
00:57:58,698 --> 00:58:05,400
[SPEAKER_14]: and it's this drink and it has Hello Kitty on it and it tastes like, it tastes like, you remember those fruit candies Mamba from high school?

886
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:08,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Mamba candies.

887
00:58:08,341 --> 00:58:10,761
[SPEAKER_14]: It tastes like a liquid version of Mamba candies.

888
00:58:12,081 --> 00:58:15,862
[SPEAKER_14]: But when you open it, it opens worse than a bottle of champagne.

889
00:58:15,882 --> 00:58:16,723
[SPEAKER_14]: He has to point it away.

890
00:58:17,083 --> 00:58:22,624
[SPEAKER_14]: We opened it in his backyard and when you open it, the plastic top flew 40 yards and he didn't even shake it.

891
00:58:23,164 --> 00:58:24,845
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's why we call it the explosive Hello Kitty drink.

892
00:58:24,865 --> 00:58:25,545
[SPEAKER_14]: You should shake it.

893
00:58:27,594 --> 00:58:28,294
[SPEAKER_24]: Yo, what's this?

894
00:58:28,515 --> 00:58:29,195
[SPEAKER_24]: Pointing at the bird.

895
00:58:31,276 --> 00:58:32,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Shake it and take it to RVGL.

896
00:58:34,078 --> 00:58:34,198
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh!

897
00:58:34,658 --> 00:58:35,178
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god!

898
00:58:35,438 --> 00:58:35,999
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a great idea.

899
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:38,760
[SPEAKER_14]: Who wants to take exploding Hello Kitty drink to RVGL?

900
00:58:39,821 --> 00:58:42,783
[SPEAKER_04]: We can like shake it up like... First of all, who wants to go to RVGL?

901
00:58:42,903 --> 00:58:43,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Cricket noise.

902
00:58:43,503 --> 00:58:46,945
[SPEAKER_11]: You can hurt the kids in RVGL.

903
00:58:49,546 --> 00:58:52,228
[SPEAKER_06]: I do so I can kick the crap out of some stupid little raver kids.

904
00:58:53,971 --> 00:58:54,271
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm eating.

905
00:59:22,543 --> 00:59:23,943
[SPEAKER_24]: And you know, we kind of got on a tangent.

906
00:59:24,344 --> 00:59:25,584
[SPEAKER_24]: We were talking about Bomani news.

907
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:26,924
[SPEAKER_24]: We had tons of it to cover.

908
00:59:27,484 --> 00:59:29,045
[SPEAKER_24]: And then I got a cool little back.

909
00:59:29,385 --> 00:59:30,425
[SPEAKER_18]: Everybody!

910
00:59:31,065 --> 00:59:32,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody!

911
00:59:35,827 --> 00:59:38,428
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you want to talk about now, then?

912
00:59:38,488 --> 00:59:39,908
[SPEAKER_14]: There's still plenty of Bomani news to talk about.

913
00:59:39,928 --> 00:59:40,788
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to talk about something new?

914
00:59:41,868 --> 00:59:42,289
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

915
00:59:42,369 --> 00:59:44,249
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's talk about DDR Ultramix.

916
00:59:44,529 --> 00:59:45,329
[SPEAKER_14]: I was about to say that.

917
00:59:45,349 --> 00:59:46,830
[SPEAKER_11]: That is the stupidest idea in the world.

918
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:47,230
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

919
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:50,011
[SPEAKER_11]: It's DDR PC 2.

920
00:59:53,903 --> 00:59:55,024
[SPEAKER_11]: It's ultra crap!

921
00:59:55,744 --> 01:00:00,226
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, ooh, what, are we going to have more lovely characters that we're all going to drool all over?

922
01:00:00,927 --> 01:00:01,207
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

923
01:00:03,088 --> 01:00:05,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Trojan Man is the first unlock, just so you know.

924
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:07,990
[SPEAKER_14]: This is being leaked, by the way.

925
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:12,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody had discovered this on the ratings board website.

926
01:00:12,972 --> 01:00:15,414
[SPEAKER_14]: There was this website, you know, that you go to to get the ratings.

927
01:00:15,434 --> 01:00:19,055
[SPEAKER_24]: How sad is it that people browse that site to look for new games that are coming out?

928
01:00:19,896 --> 01:00:20,256
[SPEAKER_24]: It worked.

929
01:00:24,088 --> 01:00:32,076
[SPEAKER_11]: This is something I brought up in the chatroom a few nights ago when I mentioned this for no apparent reason.

930
01:00:32,997 --> 01:00:41,987
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, probably about 85-90% of the Bimani community, probably worldwide, knows about Stepmania or knows about DWI.

931
01:00:42,831 --> 01:00:53,213
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's like, why waste however much they're going to try to charge you for this stupid-ass game and just go spend a few hours a day downloading a bunch of songs and you'll be just fine?

932
01:00:53,293 --> 01:00:55,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Or do you really want the most retarded characters in the world?

933
01:00:56,614 --> 01:01:01,835
[SPEAKER_24]: Because it's all about the kick-ass characters and the possibility that there might be new stuff even though there will never be new stuff.

934
01:01:04,296 --> 01:01:06,496
[SPEAKER_14]: Now Jazz in the chatroom makes a good point.

935
01:01:06,937 --> 01:01:08,457
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't judge it till you play it.

936
01:01:10,075 --> 01:01:10,735
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, okay.

937
01:01:11,275 --> 01:01:11,876
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

938
01:01:12,436 --> 01:01:13,836
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going by track record here.

939
01:01:13,856 --> 01:01:15,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I don't know.

940
01:01:16,157 --> 01:01:20,678
[SPEAKER_11]: If I'm correct, I've heard that from plenty of people before DDRPC came out.

941
01:01:20,938 --> 01:01:25,200
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, oh, you can't judge me before you play it, and then you play it, and they get mad at you for judging it.

942
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,700
[SPEAKER_11]: It sucked, and they all sucked.

943
01:01:31,802 --> 01:01:33,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

944
01:01:33,662 --> 01:01:34,102
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

945
01:01:34,323 --> 01:01:37,804
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard that about anal sex one time, but I'm not going to try it.

946
01:01:37,844 --> 01:01:39,044
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll judge it before I try it.

947
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:47,032
[SPEAKER_11]: That... Well, you know, we were doing really good with this show, not going any type of porno way, and now all of a sudden, anal sex, pop!

948
01:01:49,034 --> 01:01:51,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly, you couldn't have summed it up better.

949
01:01:51,076 --> 01:01:52,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Anal sex, pop.

950
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:56,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

951
01:01:56,521 --> 01:01:58,463
[SPEAKER_11]: That's actually what Kyle Snyder songs sound like.

952
01:01:58,983 --> 01:02:03,867
[SPEAKER_24]: Does anybody else want to... I think people would have preferred anal sex over that Kyle Snyder song, seriously.

953
01:02:11,377 --> 01:02:13,518
[SPEAKER_24]: What new characters can we look forward to?

954
01:02:13,838 --> 01:02:16,780
[SPEAKER_24]: What wonderful ideas will Konami of America come out with?

955
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,222
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a listless topic.

956
01:02:21,222 --> 01:02:22,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Will we get another paranoia?

957
01:02:26,246 --> 01:02:26,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Nope.

958
01:02:27,608 --> 01:02:28,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Dude, I'm so tired of Paranoia.

959
01:02:29,170 --> 01:02:30,972
[SPEAKER_11]: If I hear one more Paranoia, I'm gonna punch someone.

960
01:02:31,393 --> 01:02:32,995
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I didn't think Paranoia was Survivor, was I?

961
01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:35,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Paranoia... That was the only, like, good one.

962
01:02:35,779 --> 01:02:36,920
[SPEAKER_11]: That and Evolution.

963
01:02:37,561 --> 01:02:41,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, Paranoia's Survivor Max was so original, too, with its extra few seconds fed up.

964
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:54,627
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, as far as I'm concerned, Paranoia needs to die, Naoki needs to die, and... Well, no, if he died, then there would be no songs for DDR, because he's every artist.

965
01:02:54,767 --> 01:02:55,387
[SPEAKER_24]: Fuck that, man!

966
01:02:55,427 --> 01:02:56,868
[SPEAKER_24]: Get Good Cool to do all the music!

967
01:02:56,888 --> 01:02:57,728
[SPEAKER_24]: That would kick ass!

968
01:02:57,748 --> 01:02:59,848
[SPEAKER_04]: We need Good Cool and Tack to do all the music.

969
01:03:00,508 --> 01:03:01,148
[SPEAKER_24]: And Taka, too.

970
01:03:04,289 --> 01:03:04,989
[SPEAKER_24]: Fuck Naoki.

971
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:09,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Naoki needs to go back and do more Gradius music.

972
01:03:12,131 --> 01:03:12,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Akira Yamaoka.

973
01:03:14,907 --> 01:03:17,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we need more Yamaoka songs.

974
01:03:17,888 --> 01:03:23,811
[SPEAKER_24]: But seriously though, what they need to do... Didn't it seem like everything with DDR Extreme was just being lazy?

975
01:03:24,391 --> 01:03:30,274
[SPEAKER_24]: Like they're lazy on the whole unlock system, they're lazy on the songs that they put in there, they're lazy on the soundtrack that they released.

976
01:03:30,934 --> 01:03:39,183
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just the whole thing is like, you know, I could have made this a good game, but, you know, I just kind of want to sit down and sleep.

977
01:03:39,743 --> 01:03:46,450
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something more fascinating than DDR, whatever that crap is, Ultimate Battle 22.

978
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:47,291
[SPEAKER_11]: We went too extreme.

979
01:03:49,728 --> 01:03:51,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Me eating Pocky is more amusing.

980
01:03:52,029 --> 01:03:53,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Go the record, Rob did something phallic.

981
01:04:10,771 --> 01:04:11,572
[SPEAKER_11]: He still is!

982
01:04:13,193 --> 01:04:13,954
[SPEAKER_11]: This is wrong.

983
01:04:14,915 --> 01:04:20,700
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, it's just, they're gonna do it because they know people are gonna play it anyway because it's the next new thing that's retarded.

984
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:23,062
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's how you lose your fanbase.

985
01:04:23,922 --> 01:04:24,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Right there.

986
01:04:25,083 --> 01:04:27,065
[SPEAKER_06]: You might wanna stop and get a little turned on over here.

987
01:04:29,227 --> 01:04:31,909
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, you lose your fanbase just about as well as Metallica did.

988
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:33,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice analogy.

989
01:04:36,953 --> 01:04:37,534
[SPEAKER_33]: Metallica who?

990
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:40,840
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyways.

991
01:04:41,401 --> 01:04:46,923
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, so Ultramix sucks ass, and I won't buy it, but I'll download it off of some site.

992
01:04:47,683 --> 01:04:48,004
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sure.

993
01:04:49,224 --> 01:04:52,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I have video game news.

994
01:04:52,866 --> 01:04:53,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

995
01:04:53,106 --> 01:04:53,666
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on a minute.

996
01:04:53,846 --> 01:04:55,767
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie, everybody has an announcement.

997
01:04:56,127 --> 01:05:00,829
[SPEAKER_29]: Fuck you.

998
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:04,371
[SPEAKER_04]: I have two announcements.

999
01:05:05,831 --> 01:05:07,312
[SPEAKER_04]: And neither of them are related to Bibani.

1000
01:05:07,912 --> 01:05:09,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Shock, shock, shock, shock.

1001
01:05:10,561 --> 01:05:20,749
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one is in a few weeks from now in IRC or possibly AIM if I'm feeling like being, you know, nice to people who don't use IRC.

1002
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:26,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Gonna be running a Battle Royale game, stat-based, like a tabletop game except on IRC.

1003
01:05:26,614 --> 01:05:29,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

1004
01:05:31,038 --> 01:05:32,339
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I saw something cool.

1005
01:05:33,219 --> 01:05:35,141
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my friends online made me download something cool.

1006
01:05:36,602 --> 01:05:39,885
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the teaser for Kingdom Hearts 2.

1007
01:05:43,899 --> 01:05:46,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up!

1008
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:58,203
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really cool, except there's all this neat hardcore fighting, and then it's like one of the people doing hardcore fighting, landing in cool poses while wearing lots of black, is Mickey Mouse.

1009
01:06:00,124 --> 01:06:03,244
[SPEAKER_11]: So with all this hardcore fighting, is there any hardcore sex?

1010
01:06:05,405 --> 01:06:08,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to know about that associated with Kingdom Hearts 2, thank you very much!

1011
01:06:09,969 --> 01:06:10,309
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I do.

1012
01:06:10,389 --> 01:06:12,470
[SPEAKER_11]: You just do it with the Final Fantasy characters.

1013
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:14,151
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't do it with the Disney characters.

1014
01:06:16,452 --> 01:06:18,013
[SPEAKER_11]: This was posted in Jamie's Life Journal.

1015
01:06:18,033 --> 01:06:23,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, actually, that was another thing I wanted to bring up.

1016
01:06:23,675 --> 01:06:24,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Post that in the chat room.

1017
01:06:24,696 --> 01:06:26,556
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the best fan art ever.

1018
01:06:27,077 --> 01:06:34,700
[SPEAKER_04]: For anyone who remembers the race at the beginning of Kingdom Hearts, this is the best fan art ever.

1019
01:06:36,627 --> 01:06:38,428
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the score now, eh, Riku?

1020
01:06:38,488 --> 01:06:43,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you agree?

1021
01:06:43,810 --> 01:06:45,711
[SPEAKER_14]: Final Fuck X, yay.

1022
01:06:47,672 --> 01:06:48,613
[SPEAKER_14]: Kingdom Hard-On.

1023
01:06:53,535 --> 01:06:55,816
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, maybe that's the name of the doujinshi somewhere.

1024
01:06:57,416 --> 01:06:58,117
[SPEAKER_11]: Kingdom Hurts.

1025
01:07:02,509 --> 01:07:05,530
[SPEAKER_11]: God, this could, like, take up the whole show right here.

1026
01:07:06,271 --> 01:07:06,871
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm fine with that.

1027
01:07:07,891 --> 01:07:13,514
[SPEAKER_04]: RPG-related, uh... Like, Secret of Mana, Secret of Flesh or something.

1028
01:07:14,774 --> 01:07:16,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the Temple of Butt.

1029
01:07:16,255 --> 01:07:17,015
[SPEAKER_11]: Poking at Mana.

1030
01:07:18,255 --> 01:07:22,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Ness151 in our chatroom has an interesting motto for life.

1031
01:07:22,757 --> 01:07:25,779
[SPEAKER_14]: When life gives you a lemon, toss it back and scream, HENTAI!

1032
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:53,984
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyways, we should move along here No, when life gives me lemons, I throw grenades back When life throws me lemons, I eat a lime, because limes are better When life throws me lemons, I just give myself glass of heifer bison

1033
01:07:58,126 --> 01:08:01,147
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, my friend was telling me about this porn without this lemon.

1034
01:08:01,907 --> 01:08:02,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

1035
01:08:02,548 --> 01:08:04,628
[SPEAKER_11]: When life gives me lemons, I poison the lemonade.

1036
01:08:05,929 --> 01:08:06,889
[SPEAKER_04]: That's beautiful.

1037
01:08:07,409 --> 01:08:08,770
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the best ever.

1038
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:09,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1039
01:08:09,370 --> 01:08:10,890
[SPEAKER_24]: I decided to talk about something else.

1040
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:11,490
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, anyways.

1041
01:08:12,411 --> 01:08:15,492
[SPEAKER_24]: DDR Max 2, obviously, is coming out in like two weeks.

1042
01:08:16,332 --> 01:08:18,493
[SPEAKER_24]: More information being released by Konami.

1043
01:08:19,453 --> 01:08:21,334
[SPEAKER_24]: Of course, we know we were, you know...

1044
01:08:22,114 --> 01:08:27,296
[SPEAKER_24]: Assuming that there's going to be more stuff about being able to create Onis, and that is in there.

1045
01:08:27,576 --> 01:08:30,177
[SPEAKER_24]: You can create your own Oni courses, so that's kind of cool.

1046
01:08:30,457 --> 01:08:34,458
[SPEAKER_24]: Plus, as before, we were talking about previous songs from DDR Extreme, which are going to be in there.

1047
01:08:35,118 --> 01:08:39,179
[SPEAKER_24]: Two confirmed songs from Konami right now are Level of Shine and Crash.

1048
01:08:43,401 --> 01:08:46,802
[SPEAKER_24]: Stop it with the ninja cookie thingies, crackers.

1049
01:08:49,102 --> 01:08:50,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I am disappointed by this box of Pokey.

1050
01:08:51,807 --> 01:08:53,768
[SPEAKER_04]: It does not have a special unit CD.

1051
01:08:54,308 --> 01:08:56,249
[SPEAKER_04]: But the words special unit are really funny.

1052
01:09:00,651 --> 01:09:02,792
[SPEAKER_04]: You and your special unit can go stand in the hall, sir.

1053
01:09:04,632 --> 01:09:06,133
[SPEAKER_11]: Will there be any good porno in the hall?

1054
01:09:08,094 --> 01:09:09,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, why don't you do it yourself?

1055
01:09:10,295 --> 01:09:12,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Then I guess me and my special unit won't be working together today.

1056
01:09:15,757 --> 01:09:16,717
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, there's a barcode.

1057
01:09:16,757 --> 01:09:19,138
[SPEAKER_30]: Could I win a special unit CD?

1058
01:09:20,199 --> 01:09:20,439
[SPEAKER_30]: Huh.

1059
01:09:21,098 --> 01:09:25,400
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been asked to play a movie that we got here in the chat room.

1060
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:31,522
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, this might cause drops though, so if this causes too many drops, we're going to have to cut this segment, but we'll try it.

1061
01:09:31,662 --> 01:09:35,623
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I have done movies on the show way back on episode number like three or something.

1062
01:09:35,643 --> 01:09:36,623
[SPEAKER_14]: You remember that whole controversy?

1063
01:09:36,663 --> 01:09:38,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I wasn't here!

1064
01:09:38,504 --> 01:09:39,324
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember, I remember.

1065
01:09:39,344 --> 01:09:45,327
[SPEAKER_24]: I remember the, you know, it's like a giant spaceship place.

1066
01:09:45,747 --> 01:09:47,287
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah, we did play that, you were here for that.

1067
01:09:47,347 --> 01:09:49,368
[SPEAKER_30]: We need to do that, put that promo back in.

1068
01:09:50,342 --> 01:09:51,543
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll play that after the next break.

1069
01:09:51,804 --> 01:09:53,185
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, but anyway, let's see if this will work.

1070
01:09:53,405 --> 01:09:55,488
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, we might drop, have some dropouts.

1071
01:09:55,508 --> 01:09:56,809
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see if it works.

1072
01:09:58,070 --> 01:09:58,411
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1073
01:10:00,633 --> 01:10:01,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Loading, loading, loading.

1074
01:10:01,694 --> 01:10:02,055
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we go!

1075
01:10:05,686 --> 01:10:09,407
[SPEAKER_27]: Zelda, Duke Onkled is under attack by the evil forces of Ganon.

1076
01:10:09,547 --> 01:10:11,428
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm going to Gamelon to aid him.

1077
01:10:11,788 --> 01:10:13,788
[SPEAKER_19]: But Father, what if something happens to you?

1078
01:10:14,249 --> 01:10:16,549
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll take the Triforce of Courage to protect me.

1079
01:10:16,609 --> 01:10:19,810
[SPEAKER_27]: If you don't hear from me in a month, send Link.

1080
01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:22,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Impa, don't worry, Zelda.

1081
01:10:23,271 --> 01:10:26,992
[SPEAKER_03]: The Triforce of Wisdom promises the king will safely return.

1082
01:10:27,532 --> 01:10:27,853
[SPEAKER_27]: Enough.

1083
01:10:28,293 --> 01:10:30,113
[SPEAKER_27]: My ship sails in the morning.

1084
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:32,354
[SPEAKER_27]: I wonder what's for dinner.

1085
01:10:33,181 --> 01:10:37,003
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh boy, I'm so hungry, I could eat an Octorok.

1086
01:10:40,665 --> 01:10:42,266
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so hungry, I could eat Zelda.

1087
01:10:42,386 --> 01:10:45,087
[SPEAKER_25]: A whole month gone, and still no word.

1088
01:10:45,307 --> 01:10:46,168
[SPEAKER_24]: Shut up, you hippie!

1089
01:10:46,348 --> 01:10:50,470
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, that old Ganon's no match for the king.

1090
01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:54,092
[SPEAKER_25]: Link, go to Gamelon and find my father.

1091
01:10:54,112 --> 01:10:57,194
[SPEAKER_25]: Great, I can't wait to bomb some Dodongos.

1092
01:10:58,094 --> 01:10:59,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, Link is totally gay.

1093
01:11:01,946 --> 01:11:02,889
[SPEAKER_25]: Wake up, Impa.

1094
01:11:03,090 --> 01:11:04,455
[SPEAKER_25]: We're going to Gammon.

1095
01:11:05,057 --> 01:11:06,020
[SPEAKER_29]: All right, dear.

1096
01:11:06,542 --> 01:11:08,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get the Triforce of Wisdom.

1097
01:11:13,564 --> 01:11:14,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Beautiful.

1098
01:11:14,164 --> 01:11:15,886
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to see another movie from that game?

1099
01:11:16,106 --> 01:11:17,587
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1100
01:11:18,488 --> 01:11:22,271
[SPEAKER_14]: Since there's such a huge demand for it, let's see another movie.

1101
01:11:22,451 --> 01:11:25,473
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob, can you give me back those minutes of life you just wasted?

1102
01:11:25,613 --> 01:11:25,753
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1103
01:11:26,113 --> 01:11:26,974
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, I'm going to take more.

1104
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:30,177
[SPEAKER_22]: Gee, it sure is boring around here.

1105
01:11:30,597 --> 01:11:32,338
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I'm playing this game.

1106
01:11:32,398 --> 01:11:33,379
[SPEAKER_27]: He's wearing lipstick.

1107
01:11:33,439 --> 01:11:33,699
[SPEAKER_27]: So is he.

1108
01:11:40,256 --> 01:11:45,078
[SPEAKER_25]: Your Majesty, Ganon and Link came to the island of paradise.

1109
01:11:45,099 --> 01:11:47,300
[SPEAKER_25]: Hmm, how can we help?

1110
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:51,122
[SPEAKER_25]: It is written, only Link can defeat Ganon.

1111
01:11:51,802 --> 01:11:53,543
[SPEAKER_25]: Great, I'll grab my stuff.

1112
01:11:53,863 --> 01:11:55,404
[SPEAKER_25]: There is no time, your sword is enough.

1113
01:11:55,424 --> 01:11:56,464
[SPEAKER_25]: By Ganon we mean George Bush.

1114
01:11:57,785 --> 01:11:58,705
[SPEAKER_25]: How about a kiss?

1115
01:11:59,086 --> 01:11:59,586
[SPEAKER_25]: For luck.

1116
01:11:59,846 --> 01:12:00,987
[SPEAKER_25]: You've got to be kidding.

1117
01:12:02,267 --> 01:12:03,928
[SPEAKER_25]: Squadala, we are off.

1118
01:12:04,769 --> 01:12:05,309
[SPEAKER_25]: Wow.

1119
01:12:05,996 --> 01:12:07,697
[SPEAKER_25]: What are all those heads?

1120
01:12:08,217 --> 01:12:11,199
[SPEAKER_25]: These are the faces of evil.

1121
01:12:11,499 --> 01:12:13,601
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a big map.

1122
01:12:14,421 --> 01:12:15,862
[SPEAKER_25]: I guess I better get going.

1123
01:12:16,362 --> 01:12:17,963
[SPEAKER_25]: Here is the map.

1124
01:12:18,544 --> 01:12:20,085
[SPEAKER_25]: Where do you wish to go?

1125
01:12:24,868 --> 01:12:25,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Amazing.

1126
01:12:26,769 --> 01:12:27,009
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1127
01:12:27,970 --> 01:12:29,651
[SPEAKER_14]: One more, come on, come on, come on.

1128
01:12:31,172 --> 01:12:32,072
[SPEAKER_04]: We violated the map.

1129
01:12:32,172 --> 01:12:33,393
[SPEAKER_14]: One more, a quick one, a quick one.

1130
01:12:39,804 --> 01:12:40,824
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I have to click play.

1131
01:12:41,385 --> 01:12:42,265
[SPEAKER_14]: I forgot to click play.

1132
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:52,289
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

1133
01:12:52,669 --> 01:12:53,249
[SPEAKER_14]: That music.

1134
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:55,730
[SPEAKER_11]: That sword noise.

1135
01:12:58,591 --> 01:13:02,313
[SPEAKER_11]: According to this video, he was playing the crisscross video game.

1136
01:13:02,853 --> 01:13:03,853
[SPEAKER_11]: He's like jumping a lot.

1137
01:13:03,993 --> 01:13:05,514
[SPEAKER_11]: That was just amazing.

1138
01:13:08,847 --> 01:13:11,668
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why that game is not recognized as part of the Zelda universe.

1139
01:13:11,688 --> 01:13:13,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, did you play Majora's Mask?

1140
01:13:15,689 --> 01:13:16,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Majora's what?

1141
01:13:16,989 --> 01:13:17,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1142
01:13:18,309 --> 01:13:19,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Majora's ass.

1143
01:13:23,551 --> 01:13:25,671
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, yeah.

1144
01:13:25,731 --> 01:13:29,552
[SPEAKER_14]: So, also in Bomani news this week, we can talk about this.

1145
01:13:29,592 --> 01:13:30,292
[SPEAKER_14]: This is big news.

1146
01:13:30,573 --> 01:13:31,693
[SPEAKER_14]: This has all the kids excited.

1147
01:13:32,633 --> 01:13:35,214
[SPEAKER_14]: 2DX Night Style is location testing.

1148
01:13:35,314 --> 01:13:36,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Need more tech.

1149
01:13:40,203 --> 01:13:41,364
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the look on his face.

1150
01:13:45,026 --> 01:13:47,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the songs that are going to be in 2DX9 style.

1151
01:13:47,427 --> 01:13:48,788
[SPEAKER_14]: That still makes me laugh.

1152
01:13:48,968 --> 01:13:50,449
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to find the link to that page.

1153
01:13:52,390 --> 01:13:52,850
[SPEAKER_14]: They have it?

1154
01:13:53,071 --> 01:13:54,291
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going, I'm trying that.

1155
01:13:54,772 --> 01:14:02,496
[SPEAKER_14]: But there was another, there was another site that also had, there's a site, the Japanese site that had all the 8th style location tests that has it too and I don't remember where that's at.

1156
01:14:02,716 --> 01:14:06,598
[SPEAKER_11]: Newbie Monty Muse, I am two seconds behind Rob on Legend of Max.

1157
01:14:10,101 --> 01:14:15,405
[SPEAKER_14]: Um... Shit, I don't... I don't remember where that one site was, the Japanese site.

1158
01:14:17,146 --> 01:14:17,787
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not coming up.

1159
01:14:22,219 --> 01:14:23,980
[SPEAKER_14]: It's called Jamie Orgasm.

1160
01:14:54,362 --> 01:14:54,842
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

1161
01:14:55,582 --> 01:14:56,983
[SPEAKER_14]: Power Dream by Pink Pong.

1162
01:14:57,864 --> 01:14:58,524
[SPEAKER_14]: That'll be interesting.

1163
01:14:58,925 --> 01:15:02,447
[SPEAKER_14]: Rotel the Mercury instead of Rotel the Sun.

1164
01:15:02,747 --> 01:15:04,528
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going through the whole solar system.

1165
01:15:04,628 --> 01:15:06,430
[SPEAKER_14]: That'll be beautiful.

1166
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:08,831
[SPEAKER_14]: Sampling Masters Aya, Sampling Masters Mega.

1167
01:15:09,131 --> 01:15:09,532
[SPEAKER_14]: Emotion 2003.

1168
01:15:10,532 --> 01:15:13,694
[SPEAKER_14]: Emotion 2003, which is EOS remixed by Taka.

1169
01:15:14,155 --> 01:15:17,497
[SPEAKER_14]: But I thought Taka did the Emotion remix that's in Core.

1170
01:15:18,398 --> 01:15:18,958
[SPEAKER_14]: Beatmania Core.

1171
01:15:18,978 --> 01:15:20,439
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, that was also called Romantic.

1172
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:23,361
[SPEAKER_14]: So it might be the same damn song for all we know.

1173
01:15:26,869 --> 01:15:46,574
[SPEAKER_14]: Good Cool featuring Andrea L. Hopkins called Your Body New Naoki Underground song called Prelude Akira Yamoka with a song that's in Japanese I think it's called Body or that's the genre is Body

1174
01:15:50,552 --> 01:15:51,112
[SPEAKER_14]: Lion something.

1175
01:15:53,573 --> 01:15:57,274
[SPEAKER_14]: No new Orange Lounge song in 2DX9 style, which is kind of spooky.

1176
01:15:57,314 --> 01:16:05,536
[SPEAKER_24]: There is Abyss the Heavens mix, remixed by Ryu, the guy that won the remix contest back then, who did Star Mine.

1177
01:16:06,416 --> 01:16:08,097
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe he has a new song in this also.

1178
01:16:11,098 --> 01:16:11,878
[SPEAKER_14]: Ryu has a new song?

1179
01:16:11,918 --> 01:16:12,938
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't see that listed.

1180
01:16:13,258 --> 01:16:16,339
[SPEAKER_24]: I thought, I don't know, I looked the list really quickly.

1181
01:16:18,462 --> 01:16:23,344
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, chat room's kind of making some observations, like there's a lot of collaborations.

1182
01:16:23,884 --> 01:16:25,885
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, Arcadian's got it, it's Lion Suki.

1183
01:16:26,765 --> 01:16:27,125
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

1184
01:16:29,086 --> 01:16:38,049
[SPEAKER_14]: No new Orange Lounge song listed as of yet, but if I remember right, with 8 styles test, the Orange Lounge song didn't show up until after... It didn't show up until later.

1185
01:16:38,069 --> 01:16:38,529
[SPEAKER_14]: I want Pocky.

1186
01:16:41,105 --> 01:16:42,546
[SPEAKER_24]: There was also two different ones.

1187
01:16:42,566 --> 01:16:45,088
[SPEAKER_24]: There was Sampling Masters, Aya, and... Right.

1188
01:16:45,669 --> 01:16:47,110
[SPEAKER_24]: I guess those are... Aya, whatever.

1189
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:47,710
[SPEAKER_24]: Aya, Aya.

1190
01:16:48,151 --> 01:16:48,831
[SPEAKER_24]: Tomato, tomato.

1191
01:16:49,051 --> 01:16:49,812
[SPEAKER_24]: Didn't give a fuck.

1192
01:16:50,532 --> 01:16:52,034
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyways, let's see here.

1193
01:16:52,934 --> 01:16:53,935
[SPEAKER_24]: Healing Hardcore?

1194
01:16:53,955 --> 01:16:54,816
[SPEAKER_24]: What the fuck is that?

1195
01:16:55,176 --> 01:16:56,277
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, I wanted to show you guys this.

1196
01:16:56,437 --> 01:16:58,418
[SPEAKER_14]: There's some pictures that I wanted to show you guys.

1197
01:16:59,439 --> 01:16:59,519
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

1198
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:08,006
[SPEAKER_14]: And I saw pictures on the, where I saw them first was the DJ Trunks Owned You board, which is a fun little site.

1199
01:17:08,847 --> 01:17:11,308
[SPEAKER_14]: And let's see, where was that thread on NightStyle?

1200
01:17:11,348 --> 01:17:11,769
[SPEAKER_14]: Here it is.

1201
01:17:12,449 --> 01:17:16,292
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll post this link in the chat room for all you folks.

1202
01:17:16,893 --> 01:17:17,453
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, here we go.

1203
01:17:18,314 --> 01:17:20,275
[SPEAKER_14]: There's some screenshots of NightStyle right there.

1204
01:17:20,295 --> 01:17:23,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, it's very blue and orange.

1205
01:17:23,858 --> 01:17:25,780
[SPEAKER_14]: It's got like the space station theme here.

1206
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:26,981
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of interesting.

1207
01:17:27,781 --> 01:17:28,422
[SPEAKER_14]: But look at this.

1208
01:17:28,942 --> 01:17:29,783
[SPEAKER_14]: What do these look like?

1209
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:33,976
[SPEAKER_14]: Looks like E-cards.

1210
01:17:34,196 --> 01:17:35,196
[SPEAKER_14]: They look like E-cards.

1211
01:17:35,676 --> 01:17:37,036
[SPEAKER_24]: Because they say E on the bottom.

1212
01:17:41,797 --> 01:17:43,738
[SPEAKER_24]: That's the whole... Okay, how much do you want to bet?

1213
01:17:44,658 --> 01:17:45,758
[SPEAKER_24]: And you heard this here first.

1214
01:17:46,118 --> 01:17:47,999
[SPEAKER_24]: There will be E-cards for Xtreme 2.

1215
01:17:49,319 --> 01:17:50,259
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, for the new DDR?

1216
01:17:50,339 --> 01:17:50,839
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever it is?

1217
01:17:51,239 --> 01:17:53,260
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I'll bet you there will be new E-cards.

1218
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:56,360
[SPEAKER_24]: In fact, it will get rid of the whole memory card thing.

1219
01:17:58,121 --> 01:17:59,641
[SPEAKER_14]: It seems to be the way where Konami's going.

1220
01:18:01,441 --> 01:18:11,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Between Guitar Freaks and Pop Music I have this feeling that they're going to bring out some type of reader With your Playstation 2 or whatever That reads those cards You know another system they tried to do that with?

1221
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:28,603
[SPEAKER_04]: The Neo Geo Where the old NBS units You could take a card and put it on your Neo Geo system at home I've actually got the Neo Geo with the slots open on it I just haven't found a machine with working NBS slots All of our slots are wide open

1222
01:18:30,482 --> 01:18:31,563
[SPEAKER_04]: You said it, not me.

1223
01:18:37,265 --> 01:18:38,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, isn't that special?

1248
01:27:04,614 --> 01:27:11,757
[SPEAKER_01]: The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

1249
01:27:12,098 --> 01:27:12,298
[SPEAKER_01]: It's...

1250
01:27:13,619 --> 01:27:14,080
[SPEAKER_01]: on Earthly.

1251
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:18,023
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like being at a club, except you don't have to, you know, actually ask someone to dance.

1252
01:27:22,146 --> 01:27:22,606
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're back.

1253
01:27:22,626 --> 01:27:27,890
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds like a guy who must have been part of Heaven's Gate or something, talking about going to spaceships and shit.

1254
01:27:29,972 --> 01:27:32,194
[SPEAKER_11]: We're having fun opening Ramune.

1256

[SPEAKER_14]: Ramune.

[SPEAKER_14]: Ramune.

1261
01:27:42,081 --> 01:27:42,302
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

1262
01:27:44,212 --> 01:27:44,812
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob's a hick.

01:27:44,833 --> 01:27:45,493
[SPEAKER_13]: Top Romany.

[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

01:27:51,037 --> 01:27:51,838
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, kids.

1268
01:27:51,858 --> 01:27:52,959
[SPEAKER_14]: Should we do the FUs of the week now?

1269
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:55,901
[SPEAKER_14]: No, because Jamie has to go watch her ass.

1270
01:27:56,902 --> 01:27:58,683
[SPEAKER_14]: Dark Child wanted to know where that promo's from.

1271
01:27:58,743 --> 01:28:01,786
[SPEAKER_14]: That was that little clip where the guy's talking about dancing on spaceships.

1272
01:28:01,806 --> 01:28:02,666
[SPEAKER_14]: That's from a movie.

1273
01:28:02,686 --> 01:28:03,567
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you remember the name of the movie?

1274
01:28:04,368 --> 01:28:08,031
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody entered it into some San Francisco film festival.

1275
01:28:08,171 --> 01:28:09,332
[SPEAKER_24]: It was in San Francisco.

1276
01:28:09,412 --> 01:28:13,175
[SPEAKER_24]: It was somewhere back east, like Rhode Island or some crap like that.

1277
01:28:14,375 --> 01:28:15,236
[SPEAKER_24]: Delaware, I don't know.

1278
01:28:15,496 --> 01:28:17,337
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyways, it was on the KOA site.

1279
01:28:18,357 --> 01:28:21,820
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know where it's at right now, but yeah.

1280
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,702
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1281
01:28:27,843 --> 01:28:28,183
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

1282
01:28:30,325 --> 01:28:30,625
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay.

1283
01:28:30,765 --> 01:28:31,845
[SPEAKER_33]: Are we ready for the end of the week now?

1284
01:28:32,066 --> 01:28:33,606
[SPEAKER_24]: No, I heard... Okay, really quickly.

1285
01:28:33,666 --> 01:28:33,807
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure.

1286
01:28:33,827 --> 01:28:34,627
[SPEAKER_24]: It has to be really quick.

1287
01:28:34,687 --> 01:28:34,947
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure.

1288
01:28:35,528 --> 01:28:36,608
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, and watch the board.

1289
01:28:36,628 --> 01:28:36,708
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey!

1290
01:28:36,788 --> 01:28:36,908
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey!

1291
01:28:44,479 --> 01:28:49,040
[SPEAKER_24]: I heard there was a rumor going around about Karaoke Karaoke Revolution.

1292
01:28:51,781 --> 01:28:54,922
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's also listed on EB's site if I'm not mistaken.

1293
01:28:54,962 --> 01:29:01,944
[SPEAKER_14]: It was either on EB's site or the... Yeah, so... Now, there was that...

1294
01:29:02,566 --> 01:29:11,291
[SPEAKER_14]: There was that E3 press release that came out a couple weeks ago that started all these rumors because it said Konami will have you dancing and playing outdoors and singing in 2003.

1295
01:29:11,652 --> 01:29:15,314
[SPEAKER_14]: And that kind of made people go, what does that mean?

1296
01:29:15,334 --> 01:29:19,917
[SPEAKER_14]: And as far as I thought, I figured that meant that they were probably just going to bring karaoke mode back into DDR.

1297
01:29:19,957 --> 01:29:21,918
[SPEAKER_14]: You remember in third mix, you'd have the lyrics on the screen?

1298
01:29:22,198 --> 01:29:24,900
[SPEAKER_14]: So you two could sit at home and go, Oh Nick, please not so quick.

1299
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,401
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I want it big.

1300
01:29:30,083 --> 01:29:31,304
[SPEAKER_24]: That would be cool to come back though.

1301
01:29:32,995 --> 01:29:33,696
[SPEAKER_14]: Did I go to CyberZone?

1302
01:29:33,716 --> 01:29:34,716
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I've never been to CyberZone.

1303
01:30:01,582 --> 01:30:02,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, like I like karaoke.

1304
01:30:03,203 --> 01:30:04,983
[SPEAKER_04]: You're pretending that I care about karaoke.

1305
01:30:05,964 --> 01:30:07,444
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you just don't admit it.

1306
01:30:08,385 --> 01:30:10,285
[SPEAKER_14]: I just think it'd be awesome for a segment.

1307
01:30:10,625 --> 01:30:12,086
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, that's all I'm saying.

1308
01:30:12,126 --> 01:30:12,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Blink.

1309
01:30:14,327 --> 01:30:18,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Karaoke is Japanese for tone deaf.

1310
01:30:22,510 --> 01:30:23,690
[SPEAKER_14]: Can we do the fuckies of the week now?

1311
01:30:23,890 --> 01:30:24,311
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1312
01:30:24,431 --> 01:30:25,131
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, here we go.

1313
01:30:25,151 --> 01:30:29,973
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1314
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:54,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, my fight kid of the week goes toward $1hosting.com for having morons for text who don't know that when I say moving to new server, that does mean moving to new host as well.

1315
01:30:55,366 --> 01:30:57,807
[SPEAKER_04]: If I say I'm moving to a server, you know what that means, right?

1316
01:30:58,328 --> 01:31:00,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, everybody knows what moving to a new server means.

1317
01:31:00,689 --> 01:31:02,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently the texts at $1hosting do not.

1318
01:31:03,510 --> 01:31:06,131
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're big moron built stupid heads.

1319
01:31:06,671 --> 01:31:08,912
[SPEAKER_04]: They're monkeys that fling poo at each other.

1320
01:31:09,733 --> 01:31:10,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay?

1321
01:31:12,808 --> 01:31:13,108
[SPEAKER_04]: and DuploWeb.

1322
01:31:13,128 --> 01:31:13,609
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lie.

1323
01:31:13,789 --> 01:31:14,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I'm sorry.

1324
01:31:14,309 --> 01:31:14,910
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a lie too.

1325
01:31:14,950 --> 01:31:17,191
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not really $1 because you have to pay a membership fee.

1326
01:31:17,331 --> 01:31:18,852
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're not really paying $1 a month.

1327
01:31:20,614 --> 01:31:22,215
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's DuploWeb.

1328
01:31:22,495 --> 01:31:27,198
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have known better a company named after knockoffs of Legos.

1329
01:31:28,359 --> 01:31:30,240
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?

1330
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,902
[SPEAKER_04]: They're out of business and now I can't do anything.

1331
01:31:33,142 --> 01:31:38,606
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I probably still upload to my DarkSakura.com space, but I can't move it to new service because my control panel is gone.

1332
01:31:38,886 --> 01:31:39,367
[SPEAKER_04]: They're gone.

1333
01:31:39,967 --> 01:31:41,268
[SPEAKER_04]: And ugh, it pisses me off.

1334
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:43,681
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I'm pissed.

1335
01:31:44,221 --> 01:31:48,084
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, um... Yeah, I'm done.

1336
01:31:48,685 --> 01:31:51,187
[SPEAKER_04]: My angst is somewhat worn off.

1337
01:31:55,030 --> 01:31:55,650
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, it's my turn.

1338
01:31:55,971 --> 01:31:56,731
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1339
01:31:57,032 --> 01:31:59,574
[SPEAKER_24]: Um... Mostly petty stuff this week.

1340
01:31:59,814 --> 01:32:01,875
[SPEAKER_24]: Um... Big F you...

1341
01:32:04,311 --> 01:32:24,937
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, big F for you, Warner Brothers, because I don't like you anymore, because you didn't give me a full screener for the Animatrix, you gave me some fucking trailer that I downloaded off the internet the week before, and also the fact that you're releasing The Matrix Reloaded on May 15th and not last Friday, and the fact that, um, um, you suck.

1342
01:32:26,278 --> 01:32:28,819
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, Warner Brothers, they suck ass.

1343
01:32:28,839 --> 01:32:31,659
[SPEAKER_24]: There's one more reason why I hated them, but I can't remember what it is offhand.

1344
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:33,520
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, because they smell.

1345
01:32:34,122 --> 01:32:55,110
[SPEAKER_24]: and um, let's see, there's also a big FDU for um, stupid people in Scandia, because that's so generic, and um, um, stupid spammers, and, come on, I, spammers, you jackass, spaniards, what fucking problem is

1346
01:32:55,812 --> 01:32:57,494
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, let's see.

1347
01:32:58,935 --> 01:32:59,376
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, oh, oh!

1348
01:32:59,636 --> 01:33:05,582
[SPEAKER_24]: And also to the core, because that movie sucked ass and should have never been made, and it was a waste of time for anyone that went there.

1349
01:33:05,602 --> 01:33:08,505
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, that movie probably slurred your soul, so, um... Then why did you go?

1350
01:33:08,525 --> 01:33:09,326
[SPEAKER_24]: I didn't go.

1351
01:33:09,706 --> 01:33:09,886
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh.

1352
01:33:10,287 --> 01:33:11,348
[SPEAKER_19]: Ha ha ha ha ha!

1353
01:33:11,768 --> 01:33:12,289
[SPEAKER_19]: Ha ha!

1354
01:33:14,191 --> 01:33:16,293
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, I didn't go, but I can still bitch about it.

1355
01:33:17,214 --> 01:33:17,374
[SPEAKER_24]: Um...

1356
01:33:20,016 --> 01:33:25,579
[SPEAKER_24]: Also a big FU to New Line for releasing Kangaroo, or that stupid Kangaroo move, Kangaroo Jack.

1357
01:33:26,479 --> 01:33:27,300
[SPEAKER_24]: Captain Jack.

1358
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:32,863
[SPEAKER_24]: See, now that would have been more entertaining if it was Captain Jack running around in the Outback and shooting people.

1359
01:33:32,903 --> 01:33:35,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if it was Captain Jack, there would have been a wet t-shirt contest in there.

1360
01:33:35,804 --> 01:33:37,965
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, exactly.

1361
01:33:41,107 --> 01:33:45,209
[SPEAKER_24]: God damn it for making the Matrix Reloaded look so cool and having me wait.

1362
01:33:46,278 --> 01:33:53,319
[SPEAKER_14]: and the fact that the Matrix Reloaded is coming out at the same time E3 is and so if we get tickets to E3 I'm not gonna be able to see it even though I bought tickets for it already!

1363
01:33:58,540 --> 01:33:59,981
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll be able to scalp those tickets.

1364
01:34:03,701 --> 01:34:05,202
[SPEAKER_24]: But I wanna go see the movie!

1365
01:34:06,102 --> 01:34:06,462
[SPEAKER_13]: Now!

1366
01:34:06,862 --> 01:34:08,682
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll be there when you get back, okay?

1367
01:34:08,803 --> 01:34:09,823
[SPEAKER_13]: E3's not gonna be there.

1368
01:34:09,963 --> 01:34:11,143
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll be all over the internet.

1369
01:34:12,844 --> 01:34:16,125
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to see the movie opening day!

1370
01:34:16,185 --> 01:34:18,886
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to see it opening day!

1371
01:34:18,966 --> 01:34:21,167
[SPEAKER_13]: I already bought tickets!

1372
01:34:21,647 --> 01:34:24,008
[SPEAKER_14]: Because he is one of those geeky guys who dresses like Neo.

1373
01:34:27,129 --> 01:34:28,730
[SPEAKER_13]: I set that one up for you perfectly though.

1374
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:29,290
[SPEAKER_14]: You're welcome.

1375
01:34:30,130 --> 01:34:32,231
[SPEAKER_14]: So I have the glasses and the trench coat, so sue me.

1376
01:34:32,691 --> 01:34:34,532
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you see his Dynamite Rave routine at SCAT?

1377
01:34:36,001 --> 01:34:36,622
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you see it?

1378
01:34:36,782 --> 01:34:38,143
[SPEAKER_14]: Did all two seconds of it.

1379
01:34:40,946 --> 01:34:42,487
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't really have that much this week.

1380
01:34:42,547 --> 01:34:46,031
[SPEAKER_24]: I was pissed off during the week and then I just slowly cooled off.

1381
01:34:46,371 --> 01:34:46,872
[SPEAKER_24]: I hate that.

1382
01:34:47,272 --> 01:34:56,821
[SPEAKER_24]: See, fuck off shows will be awesome when we move because I'll be able to spout off my dislike for society on a daily basis.

1383
01:35:00,084 --> 01:35:00,545
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, I'm done.

1384
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:06,202
[SPEAKER_14]: My FU of the week goes out to Pokemon Ruby.

1385
01:35:07,443 --> 01:35:09,605
[SPEAKER_14]: Because ever since I bought that game, I can't stop playing it!

1386
01:35:10,426 --> 01:35:11,667
[SPEAKER_14]: And I feel like really immature.

1387
01:35:12,968 --> 01:35:13,529
[SPEAKER_14]: But you know what?

1388
01:35:13,569 --> 01:35:13,989
[SPEAKER_14]: It's fun.

1389
01:35:14,670 --> 01:35:15,831
[SPEAKER_06]: How many Pokemon are in that one?

1390
01:35:16,551 --> 01:35:17,292
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, about 200.

1391
01:35:17,332 --> 01:35:17,612
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a lot.

1392
01:35:18,973 --> 01:35:21,195
[SPEAKER_24]: Really quickly, this will only take a second.

1393
01:35:21,375 --> 01:35:29,741
[SPEAKER_14]: F you to the press because they don't realize that all these Iraqi children that are killed in the street are probably from all the gunshots that people are firing in celebration of the fact that the regime is over.

1394
01:35:30,101 --> 01:35:32,362
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't realize that bullets go up and then they come down.

1395
01:35:32,563 --> 01:35:33,763
[SPEAKER_14]: Why are all my children dead?

1396
01:35:33,844 --> 01:35:34,564
[SPEAKER_14]: I do not know!

1397
01:35:35,425 --> 01:35:43,771
[SPEAKER_14]: So... Right, um...

1398
01:35:44,954 --> 01:35:47,220
[SPEAKER_04]: They fire off a gun and there's birds falling everywhere.

1399
01:35:47,781 --> 01:35:48,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Squirrels.

1400
01:35:48,844 --> 01:35:51,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Little Iraqi suicide bombing squirrels.

1401
01:35:51,741 --> 01:35:54,063
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I came up with a good idea for your Pokemon thing.

1402
01:35:54,543 --> 01:35:58,986
[SPEAKER_11]: It was if, like, they had, like, a fighting game where the Pokemon actually had to fight each other.

1403
01:35:59,006 --> 01:35:59,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Pokemon Stadium!

1404
01:35:59,906 --> 01:36:01,347
[SPEAKER_11]: No, like, to the death.

1405
01:36:02,068 --> 01:36:06,351
[SPEAKER_11]: And, like, there would be three, there would be, like, different, yes, there would be, like, different classes.

1406
01:36:06,451 --> 01:36:10,153
[SPEAKER_11]: There would be adults, and then little ones, and then there are some of them.

1407
01:36:10,474 --> 01:36:19,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like, you know how you have, like, Pikachu becomes Raichu, and that's all they have, but then there's ones where it's, like, Squirtle, and then I forget what he turns into after that, and then he becomes Blastoise.

1408
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:20,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1409
01:36:22,121 --> 01:36:34,690
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Wartortle Anyways, there's one more thing really quickly They're releasing a live version of Battle Angel Battle Angel Remember the cybernetic chick that fights people and shit?

1410
01:36:34,991 --> 01:36:37,392
[SPEAKER_04]: A live action version Are they basing it off of a comic?

1411
01:36:37,492 --> 01:36:47,760
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes The comic's ruled Alright, I didn't really have any FUs of the week outside of that So I guess I'm done Let's go around the room and hear from everyone else Zero

1412
01:36:50,242 --> 01:36:51,523
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I actually have a couple.

1413
01:36:51,563 --> 01:36:54,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Not a whole lot, and this is the worst music to choose.

1414
01:36:54,564 --> 01:36:55,465
[SPEAKER_11]: What a feeling!

1415
01:36:55,565 --> 01:36:55,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways.

1416
01:36:56,365 --> 01:36:57,606
[SPEAKER_11]: No, um, okay.

1417
01:36:58,046 --> 01:36:59,927
[SPEAKER_11]: One of them I realized at Art and Fair Mall.

1418
01:37:00,408 --> 01:37:03,950
[SPEAKER_11]: To the stupid bastards who can't wash their hands after they go to the bathroom.

1419
01:37:04,290 --> 01:37:07,432
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to touch the fucking door handle after you touched it.

1420
01:37:07,852 --> 01:37:09,853
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want your lemon juice all over my head.

1421
01:37:10,673 --> 01:37:15,616
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and for the stupid... I don't give a shit what it is, it's fucking gross.

1422
01:37:16,177 --> 01:37:16,677
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, like...

1423
01:37:20,335 --> 01:37:29,638
[SPEAKER_11]: No, and then the next thing is, for the people who made those stupid hand dryers, make them warmer or something, because make them actually fucking work.

1424
01:37:30,739 --> 01:37:35,680
[SPEAKER_24]: You're not reading the directions, it says rub your hands together, it works, trust me.

1425
01:37:35,740 --> 01:37:37,421
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you know what those hand dryers are for?

1426
01:37:37,821 --> 01:37:40,722
[SPEAKER_06]: You have those in the men's restroom, you want to know why?

1427
01:37:40,742 --> 01:37:42,763
[SPEAKER_06]: So they don't have to restock paper towels for us.

1428
01:37:43,223 --> 01:37:44,364
[SPEAKER_06]: The women have paper towels.

1429
01:37:44,464 --> 01:37:46,146
[SPEAKER_06]: They also have nice mirrors, nice toilets.

1430
01:37:46,706 --> 01:37:47,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's clean.

1431
01:37:47,367 --> 01:37:51,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the women are... See, have you been in the women's bathroom at Arden Fair Mall?

1432
01:37:51,870 --> 01:37:58,356
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, the whole place smells like... It smells like urine and it's full of the dumbest people in the universe.

1433
01:37:59,217 --> 01:38:00,297
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's water everywhere.

1434
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:06,162
[SPEAKER_11]: And, like, another FU goes to the whole Pokemon thing.

1435
01:38:06,182 --> 01:38:07,884
[SPEAKER_11]: It needs to die and die quickly.

1436
01:38:09,005 --> 01:38:10,246
[SPEAKER_11]: It's gone on way too long.

1437
01:38:10,902 --> 01:38:15,363
[SPEAKER_14]: Followed by, um, yeah, that stupid Beyblade, because that sucks, too, and Yu-Gi-Oh!

1438
01:38:15,723 --> 01:38:16,383
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, bye-bye.

1439
01:38:16,683 --> 01:38:17,103
[SPEAKER_24]: Bye-bye.

1440
01:38:17,263 --> 01:38:17,543
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye-bye.

1441
01:38:17,804 --> 01:38:23,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Magic cards were cool, like, I don't know, ten years ago, or whenever they came out, and, um... Exactly!

1442
01:38:24,245 --> 01:38:25,925
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop rehashing old cartoons!

1443
01:38:25,945 --> 01:38:27,126
[SPEAKER_24]: They weren't good, they... Oh!

1444
01:38:27,366 --> 01:38:27,506
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh!

1445
01:38:27,866 --> 01:38:28,526
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, I mentioned a statement.

1446
01:38:28,566 --> 01:38:29,426
[SPEAKER_24]: Never mind, that's alright, that's fine.

1447
01:38:29,846 --> 01:38:34,767
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, one more thing, uh, F you to Konami for not releasing the DDR stream, because I'm certainly bored of DDR streams.

1448
01:38:35,187 --> 01:38:36,048
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting bored.

1449
01:38:38,607 --> 01:38:39,487
[SPEAKER_04]: My other F.U.

1450
01:38:39,507 --> 01:38:42,609
[SPEAKER_04]: of the week goes toward not having money because there's certain things that I need.

1451
01:38:43,509 --> 01:38:45,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I need a tablet, a graphics tablet for my computer.

1452
01:38:47,231 --> 01:38:50,372
[SPEAKER_04]: I need a light table to use for my art.

1453
01:38:51,773 --> 01:38:56,575
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot find... Where do I get non-photo blue pencils?

1454
01:38:56,955 --> 01:38:58,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I need non-photo blue pencils.

1455
01:38:59,016 --> 01:39:00,237
[SPEAKER_06]: I know where you can get money for that stuff.

1456
01:39:01,617 --> 01:39:02,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Come to Camhar.

1457
01:39:02,618 --> 01:39:03,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Put it on a wish list.

1458
01:39:05,148 --> 01:39:06,068
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1459
01:39:06,168 --> 01:39:10,470
[SPEAKER_11]: No, you should do what those people do on the internet, like the ones who say, help me pay my bills.

1460
01:39:10,950 --> 01:39:15,431
[SPEAKER_11]: And people send them like five bucks, just tell people, help me, help me make my comic.

1461
01:39:16,151 --> 01:39:18,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Help me, help an aspiring, you know, comic artist.

1462
01:39:18,852 --> 01:39:22,213
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing is, is that my, my comic's gonna be all fucked up anyway.

1463
01:39:22,533 --> 01:39:22,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello?

1464
01:39:23,654 --> 01:39:24,894
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess fucked up comics sell.

1465
01:39:26,275 --> 01:39:27,035
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's the whole point.

1466
01:39:27,075 --> 01:39:29,796
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, would anyone in here buy it if I, like, published it?

1467
01:39:29,936 --> 01:39:30,536
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd buy it.

1468
01:39:31,252 --> 01:39:33,994
[SPEAKER_11]: because I like your writings as it is.

1469
01:39:34,755 --> 01:39:35,936
[SPEAKER_11]: You should make a comic of it.

1470
01:39:36,516 --> 01:39:50,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, my other big fuck you goes toward not having a proper drafting table and illumination because once I scan in all the stuff that I've drawn, I see all this crap that I missed because I don't have the proper light to do any of it.

1471
01:39:50,927 --> 01:39:53,749
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, fuck not having a drafting table with a built-in light.

1472
01:39:54,130 --> 01:39:55,671
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to not having money, okay?

1473
01:39:55,811 --> 01:39:58,093
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to get a fucking costume ready for the damn...

1474
01:39:58,993 --> 01:40:00,675
[SPEAKER_11]: and I have no money.

1475
01:40:00,695 --> 01:40:01,816
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going thrift store shopping.

1476
01:40:02,297 --> 01:40:02,637
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

1477
01:40:03,117 --> 01:40:05,760
[SPEAKER_11]: I found out the perfect idea for the number two.

1478
01:40:05,780 --> 01:40:06,521
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll talk about that later.

1479
01:40:08,783 --> 01:40:09,423
[SPEAKER_11]: I figured it out.

1480
01:40:09,563 --> 01:40:10,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, he helped me figure it out later.

1481
01:40:10,885 --> 01:40:13,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, I'm done with my FU because just fuck that.

1482
01:40:16,630 --> 01:40:16,810
No.

1483
01:40:17,851 --> 01:40:19,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of us other people have fuck you's too.

1484
01:40:19,973 --> 01:40:20,374
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1485
01:40:20,874 --> 01:40:21,435
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck you then.

1486
01:40:24,116 --> 01:40:25,020
[SPEAKER_13]: No, don't fuck both of us.

1487
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:25,280
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway.

1488
01:40:25,722 --> 01:40:28,552
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, come on, continue.

1489
01:40:28,592 --> 01:40:29,134
[SPEAKER_13]: Is Anita up next?

1490
01:40:30,211 --> 01:40:31,812
[SPEAKER_05]: You should get the PS2 version.

1491
01:40:31,912 --> 01:40:33,152
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have room, but I could try.

1492
01:41:01,935 --> 01:41:02,936
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the same.

1493
01:41:03,877 --> 01:41:05,259
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, it's fine.

1494
01:41:05,279 --> 01:41:08,562
[SPEAKER_13]: You can be even stupider in your own house instead of out in the game with a bunch of people.

1495
01:41:10,103 --> 01:41:10,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1496
01:41:10,944 --> 01:41:20,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this leads into my next Fuck You of the Week, which is Fuck You to Milpitas Golf Land, because they have... Okay.

1497
01:41:21,074 --> 01:41:23,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Disney Mix, that stupid Disney DDR.

1498
01:41:23,997 --> 01:41:25,539
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate that game because...

1499
01:41:26,323 --> 01:41:26,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Let her finish.

1500
01:41:50,143 --> 01:41:53,728
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, um, oh, I had one more from Milpitas, I forgot what it was.

1501
01:41:54,068 --> 01:41:57,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, what's that place we went to with all the video games and the alcohol?

1502
01:41:58,374 --> 01:41:59,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave and Buster's.

1503
01:42:00,083 --> 01:42:02,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you to Dave & Buster's for not having any bimani.

1504
01:42:03,185 --> 01:42:04,626
[SPEAKER_13]: Dave & Buster's doesn't have any bimani?

1505
01:42:04,886 --> 01:42:05,327
[SPEAKER_13]: None!

1506
01:42:05,967 --> 01:42:06,227
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1507
01:42:06,528 --> 01:42:07,268
[SPEAKER_05]: But they have alcohol.

1508
01:42:07,788 --> 01:42:08,889
[SPEAKER_05]: They have alcohol.

1509
01:42:08,929 --> 01:42:09,730
[SPEAKER_13]: They have pump it up.

1510
01:42:10,590 --> 01:42:10,971
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.

1511
01:42:10,991 --> 01:42:12,152
[SPEAKER_13]: Do they have horse crack at Dave & Buster's?

1512
01:42:12,772 --> 01:42:13,773
[SPEAKER_13]: They have horse crack.

1513
01:42:13,813 --> 01:42:15,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Drinking and playing horse crack.

1514
01:42:15,974 --> 01:42:17,535
[SPEAKER_13]: Drinking and playing horse crack is pretty cool.

1515
01:42:17,555 --> 01:42:19,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Why do they call it horse crack?

1516
01:42:19,537 --> 01:42:21,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was Derby Owners Club or something like that.

1517
01:42:21,418 --> 01:42:22,839
[SPEAKER_05]: It is Derby Owners Club, yes.

1518
01:42:23,319 --> 01:42:25,901
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, but no bimani around really sucks.

1519
01:42:26,402 --> 01:42:28,343
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, those are my fuck you's of the week.

1520
01:42:28,383 --> 01:42:29,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

1521
01:42:31,205 --> 01:42:31,625
[SPEAKER_13]: Hook me up.

1522
01:42:31,786 --> 01:42:32,166
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm next.

1523
01:42:32,306 --> 01:42:32,946
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a quick one.

1524
01:42:33,807 --> 01:42:34,667
[SPEAKER_13]: Give me a different song.

1525
01:42:36,848 --> 01:42:37,689
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't say no to me.

1526
01:42:38,409 --> 01:42:38,970
[SPEAKER_13]: I own you.

1527
01:42:42,712 --> 01:42:44,393
[SPEAKER_13]: Hit and slap on Vilemix.

1528
01:42:50,324 --> 01:42:50,784
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, whatever.

1529
01:42:50,964 --> 01:43:09,589
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, my fuck you goes to, I know this is like an old one or whatever, but people on the internet who don't want to label files correctly when they're sharing on PCPs and stuff, I downloaded a 712 megabyte file yesterday, and I've got DSL and it should go fast, but it's on Kazaa, so it was going at like, at the fastest 20.

1530
01:43:09,809 --> 01:43:12,870
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, it took like a day to do.

1531
01:43:13,451 --> 01:43:14,591
[SPEAKER_13]: I tried to install it, it's

1532
01:43:15,635 --> 01:43:18,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Return to Castle Wolfenstein, and it's supposed to be Grand Theft Auto Vice City.

1533
01:43:20,262 --> 01:43:24,888
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, yeah, yeah, exactly, wait, wait, I was like, exactly, Return to Castle Wolfenstein, fine, I'll play that.

1534
01:43:25,369 --> 01:43:30,236
[SPEAKER_13]: It gets all the way through the installation to 99%, this file is corrupt, please download it again.

1535
01:43:30,777 --> 01:43:31,458
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll give you that, King.

1536
01:43:32,645 --> 01:43:34,166
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool, hey, make a picture of it.

1537
01:43:34,426 --> 01:43:36,586
[SPEAKER_14]: That will teach you to pirate software, little boy.

1538
01:43:36,606 --> 01:43:39,847
[SPEAKER_14]: You haven't come out for the PC yet.

1539
01:43:39,887 --> 01:43:40,428
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you tell us.

1540
01:43:40,448 --> 01:43:43,128
[SPEAKER_13]: But there are, like, really great videos out there.

1541
01:43:43,609 --> 01:43:45,409
[SPEAKER_24]: Ah, that's what you get for trying to get that.

1542
01:43:45,829 --> 01:43:49,831
[SPEAKER_24]: See, I had the same thing where I tried to get Lord of the Rings 2, and I got Sorority Boys.

1543
01:43:50,471 --> 01:43:53,112
[SPEAKER_06]: I loved Sorority Boys all the goddamn time.

1544
01:43:53,892 --> 01:43:55,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorority Boys was, like, everywhere for a while.

1545
01:43:55,873 --> 01:43:57,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, any movie you downloaded was Sorority Boys.

1546
01:43:57,773 --> 01:43:59,614
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have an evil time when Battle Royale 2 is out.

1547
01:44:02,039 --> 01:44:02,799
[SPEAKER_13]: What was the other one?

1548
01:44:02,859 --> 01:44:10,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, there was another one I tried out a little bit, I said it was GTA Vice City, and it was like, uh, some, it wasn't porn, but it was like some kiddie game.

1549
01:44:11,142 --> 01:44:15,383
[SPEAKER_13]: It was like Mavis Beacon 2003 or something.

1550
01:44:15,683 --> 01:44:17,784
[SPEAKER_13]: Mavis Beacon's the shit, I'm sorry.

1551
01:44:19,045 --> 01:44:19,965
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how I learned to type.

1552
01:44:21,445 --> 01:44:24,106
[SPEAKER_13]: I already know how to type, I learned how to type from playing on IRC.

1553
01:44:24,466 --> 01:44:26,147
[SPEAKER_14]: God, not type on Mavis Beacon.

1554
01:44:28,088 --> 01:44:29,128
[SPEAKER_13]: You're gay, dude.

1555
01:44:32,084 --> 01:44:37,065
[SPEAKER_13]: If you didn't get that, Zero says Mavis Beacon is a 250-pound black woman.

1556
01:44:37,805 --> 01:44:38,345
[SPEAKER_13]: Is she really?

1557
01:44:38,565 --> 01:44:40,406
[SPEAKER_14]: Mavis Beacon is the Oprah of computers.

1558
01:44:42,006 --> 01:44:43,206
[SPEAKER_13]: Oprah's not 250 pounds.

1559
01:44:45,086 --> 01:44:45,507
[SPEAKER_14]: She was.

1560
01:44:45,547 --> 01:44:47,527
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe her breasts are.

1561
01:44:47,587 --> 01:44:49,367
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what's really, really, really scary?

1562
01:44:49,387 --> 01:44:50,608
[SPEAKER_14]: She's going to be posing nude.

1563
01:44:51,388 --> 01:44:51,668
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1564
01:44:52,328 --> 01:44:53,488
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, serious.

1565
01:44:53,548 --> 01:44:54,968
[SPEAKER_14]: She was looking for the right photographer.

1566
01:44:54,988 --> 01:44:57,109
[SPEAKER_24]: I guess the one who can shave off 300 pounds off of her, but...

1567
01:45:01,972 --> 01:45:02,613
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, really?

1568
01:45:02,693 --> 01:45:03,193
[SPEAKER_13]: This week?

1569
01:45:05,334 --> 01:45:08,836
[SPEAKER_13]: For a lady of her age, she looks pretty good.

1570
01:45:09,697 --> 01:45:11,178
[SPEAKER_13]: She's like 50-something.

1571
01:45:12,198 --> 01:45:13,959
[SPEAKER_13]: Or about 50, I don't know.

1572
01:45:14,119 --> 01:45:16,781
[SPEAKER_13]: But the point is, we don't need to see her naked.

1573
01:45:17,061 --> 01:45:19,403
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want Dr. Phil jacking off to her magazine.

1574
01:45:19,583 --> 01:45:22,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Oprah needs to gain 200 pounds and stay there because Fat Oprah's cool.

1575
01:45:24,446 --> 01:45:26,547
[SPEAKER_04]: She was in the color purple and she kicked ass.

1576
01:45:26,647 --> 01:45:29,048
[SPEAKER_13]: Fat Oprah good, skinny Oprah bad.

1577
01:45:31,144 --> 01:45:33,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, hey, hey, it's Rad Oprah!

1578
01:45:34,567 --> 01:45:38,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I have determined that people lose personality when they lose weight.

1579
01:45:38,230 --> 01:45:39,171
[SPEAKER_04]: They lose IQ, too.

1580
01:45:40,812 --> 01:45:42,434
[SPEAKER_04]: They turn into hoes and lose IQ.

1581
01:45:43,154 --> 01:45:45,717
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's get through the last two people FUs in here, please.

1582
01:45:46,337 --> 01:45:47,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, my FU time.

1583
01:45:49,039 --> 01:45:49,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you!

1584
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:51,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Not me.

1585
01:45:52,899 --> 01:45:55,562
[SPEAKER_06]: I have two fuck yous.

1586
01:45:55,602 --> 01:45:57,163
[SPEAKER_06]: One is to Zelda, the Wind Waker, okay?

1587
01:46:19,213 --> 01:46:20,513
[SPEAKER_34]: It's an awesome game.

1588
01:46:20,533 --> 01:46:21,634
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck you for having Zelda.

1589
01:46:21,694 --> 01:46:22,394
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't even have it.

1590
01:46:22,474 --> 01:46:24,355
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't get it because they're out of stock everywhere I go.

1591
01:46:24,595 --> 01:46:27,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you for telling him to fuck off because he has Zelda.

1592
01:46:27,436 --> 01:46:28,256
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah.

1593
01:46:28,336 --> 01:46:32,777
[SPEAKER_34]: Anyway, fuck you to Zelda because the story was so incredibly cool.

1594
01:46:32,797 --> 01:46:38,199
[SPEAKER_34]: I won't spoil the ending for any of you, but if you play it, you'll know what I mean, I think.

1595
01:46:38,339 --> 01:46:38,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Link wins.

1596
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:41,080
[SPEAKER_34]: Link does not win.

1597
01:46:43,226 --> 01:46:44,607
[SPEAKER_34]: Like I said, I'm not spoiling it for anything.

1598
01:46:44,667 --> 01:46:45,547
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm taking the mic away!

1599
01:46:46,407 --> 01:46:51,470
[SPEAKER_34]: Anyway, so fuck you to Zelda, because you'll see what I mean when you play it.

1600
01:46:51,490 --> 01:46:52,970
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah, and the fact that Link looks like a monkey.

1601
01:46:53,270 --> 01:46:56,292
[SPEAKER_34]: And especially fuck you to that little kid with the booger hanging out his nose on your home island.

1602
01:46:59,093 --> 01:47:03,195
[SPEAKER_34]: My second fuck you is fuck you to the world for not giving me anything to complain about this week except Zelda.

1603
01:47:03,215 --> 01:47:06,116
[SPEAKER_34]: I mean, my god, I'm actually happy this week, and that's not okay!

1604
01:47:08,068 --> 01:47:09,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you to this week.

1605
01:47:09,829 --> 01:47:15,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it seems like everyone who normally has lots of fuck you's has lame fuck you's because they're too goddamn fucking happy.

1606
01:47:17,070 --> 01:47:18,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Jamie's were cool though.

1607
01:47:18,250 --> 01:47:20,451
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's see what the chatroom has to say.

1608
01:47:21,491 --> 01:47:22,131
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's get into the chatroom.

1609
01:47:22,151 --> 01:47:22,711
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck the chatroom.

1610
01:47:23,052 --> 01:47:24,472
[SPEAKER_14]: No, we're going to do the chatroom fuck you's now.

1611
01:47:24,512 --> 01:47:25,012
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we go.

1612
01:47:25,592 --> 01:47:31,433
[SPEAKER_14]: USFVB would like to say, fuck you to whoever decided that POWs are heroes.

1613
01:47:31,513 --> 01:47:32,014
[SPEAKER_14]: What the fuck?

1614
01:47:32,034 --> 01:47:33,574
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're a prisoner of war, that means you fucked up.

1615
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,043
[SPEAKER_14]: That was very politically incorrect.

1616
01:47:41,326 --> 01:47:42,547
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck you.

1617
01:47:42,948 --> 01:47:46,613
[SPEAKER_14]: That was more politically incorrect than anything Loki's ever said.

1618
01:47:47,714 --> 01:47:48,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Who said that fuck you?

1619
01:47:49,296 --> 01:47:50,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Who said that fuck you?

1620
01:47:51,098 --> 01:47:52,781
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the screen name of who said that fuck you?

1621
01:47:52,841 --> 01:47:53,401
[SPEAKER_14]: USFBB.

1622
01:47:54,162 --> 01:47:55,024
[SPEAKER_06]: USFBB?

1623
01:47:57,402 --> 01:47:58,823
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, what the fuck is that?

1624
01:47:59,023 --> 01:47:59,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you.

1625
01:48:00,103 --> 01:48:02,244
[SPEAKER_06]: POWs are fucking the shit.

1626
01:48:02,564 --> 01:48:04,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know what kind of hell they have to go through?

1627
01:48:05,084 --> 01:48:07,085
[SPEAKER_06]: They fucking get tortured and all this shit.

1628
01:48:07,105 --> 01:48:09,506
[SPEAKER_06]: They are fucking heroes because they made it back alive.

1629
01:48:11,166 --> 01:48:19,569
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's because I'm an ex-military guy, so... I swear to God it's only irony that I have this background song.

1630
01:48:19,629 --> 01:48:20,589
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't plan that.

1631
01:48:23,340 --> 01:48:28,301
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow, okay, Ness151 says, FUs to me being poor and not being able to play DDR anymore.

1632
01:48:28,381 --> 01:48:29,501
[SPEAKER_14]: No tokens equal no life.

1633
01:48:31,182 --> 01:48:34,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Get a hookup at Golflands of Scandia, then you won't have to pay for tokens.

1634
01:48:34,822 --> 01:48:38,503
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember that we're an international show, so they don't have Golflands of Scandias everywhere.

1635
01:48:40,324 --> 01:48:40,764
[SPEAKER_14]: They should.

1636
01:48:42,704 --> 01:48:47,825
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Mooheimer says, fuck Xenon for having such sucky easy steps.

1637
01:48:48,965 --> 01:48:51,546
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck people for sucking and people all PMS-y.

1638
01:48:52,768 --> 01:48:55,830

1642
01:49:09,117 --> 01:49:10,958
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I just have to say this over air.

01:50:25,099 --> 01:50:25,639
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say it now.

01:50:38,326 --> 01:50:39,207
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey, hey, hey.

1670
01:50:39,527 --> 01:50:40,788
[SPEAKER_24]: Best advice ever.

1671
01:50:40,908 --> 01:50:41,868
[SPEAKER_24]: You want to talk to women?

1672
01:50:42,168 --> 01:50:44,870
[SPEAKER_24]: Go to a fucking strip club because they're forced to come talk to you.

1673
01:50:45,210 --> 01:50:45,450
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay?

1674
01:50:45,470 --> 01:50:49,292
[SPEAKER_24]: And they will carry on a conversation for long hours and you don't have to pay them shit.

1675
01:50:49,592 --> 01:50:49,812
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay?

1676
01:50:49,852 --> 01:50:52,534
[SPEAKER_24]: They'll just come talk to you and then after you get done the conversation, they're like,

1677
01:50:52,714 --> 01:50:53,474
[SPEAKER_24]: Do you want to laugh at this?

1678
01:50:53,694 --> 01:50:54,035
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, no.

1679
01:50:55,035 --> 01:50:55,935
[SPEAKER_14]: See, it's perfect.

1680
01:50:56,076 --> 01:51:04,379
[SPEAKER_14]: You only spend initial, like, $20 to get in, but talking to strippers is awesome, and you'll just totally get over the whole fact that you're, like, intimidated by women because they're really hot.

1681
01:51:05,540 --> 01:51:09,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you could go to, like, a hospital, to ER, where people are stuck there laying in their hospital beds and can't get away.

1682
01:51:14,336 --> 01:51:15,197
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, my God.

1683
01:51:15,857 --> 01:51:20,660
[SPEAKER_13]: It's because when you're talking to hot, like, retarded women, it's not very, you know, intimidating.

1684
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:23,902
[SPEAKER_13]: When you're talking to hot, intelligent women, that's when I'm intimidated.

1685
01:51:25,042 --> 01:51:28,604
[SPEAKER_24]: You must be going to the city limits, man, because fucking, fucking A, dude.

1686
01:51:28,864 --> 01:51:32,487
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, Showgirl's awesome, or Pure Gold, or wherever the fuck.

1687
01:51:32,867 --> 01:51:34,388
[SPEAKER_24]: Centerfold, that's it, Centerfold.

1688
01:51:35,628 --> 01:51:36,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, fuck yous, next, please.

1689
01:51:38,391 --> 01:51:52,663
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Snub Dissonoid likes to say, fuck you to the cat penis sucking, tree hugging, weed smoking hippies that thought it would be a very cool idea to take a perfectly good FD RX-7 twin turbo, rip out the motor, and slam in some weak ass electric piece of shit motor.

1690
01:51:52,703 --> 01:51:53,704
[SPEAKER_14]: How fucking dumb can you be?

1691
01:51:54,004 --> 01:51:59,729
[SPEAKER_14]: You take a rare, special, and very fast sports car and you turn it into some fucking tree hugger beacon that radiates pure shit.

1692
01:51:59,789 --> 01:52:00,169
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck you.

1693
01:52:00,710 --> 01:52:01,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, fuck you to this thing.

1694
01:52:02,031 --> 01:52:04,353
[SPEAKER_14]: And he gives a couple flash things that I'm not going to look up right now.

1695
01:52:05,213 --> 01:52:09,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck you to the people who made those for not giving out any warnings to people who have heart problems.

1696
01:52:10,415 --> 01:52:14,536
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't personally, but those could either A, kill fat people, or B, scare the holy living shit out of kids.

1697
01:52:14,957 --> 01:52:16,117
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe some people, not even kids.

1698
01:52:16,157 --> 01:52:17,257
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, those are just kind of fucked up.

1699
01:52:17,618 --> 01:52:19,918
[SPEAKER_14]: There's some fucked up flashes that I'm not looking at right now.

1700
01:52:21,819 --> 01:52:27,021
[SPEAKER_14]: Angel would like to say F you to whatever sickness everyone is getting, because I caught a bit of it too earlier in the week.

1701
01:52:27,641 --> 01:52:30,162
[SPEAKER_14]: F you to Magus being away, and yeah, I'm better now.

1702
01:52:30,542 --> 01:52:31,903
[SPEAKER_13]: By the way, I haven't gotten sick yet.

1703
01:52:31,923 --> 01:52:32,923
[SPEAKER_13]: Just letting everyone know.

1704
01:52:33,911 --> 01:52:37,771
[SPEAKER_13]: For those who think it's SARS, I mean, that's pretty fucked up because we'd all be dead.

1705
01:52:37,791 --> 01:52:38,374
[SPEAKER_13]: Hold on.

1706
01:52:38,925 --> 01:52:39,906
[SPEAKER_13]: Little fact about SARS.

1707
01:52:40,446 --> 01:52:44,588
[SPEAKER_13]: All the people, there's been like 400 something people who've gotten SARS, only like 12 of them have died.

1708
01:52:45,848 --> 01:52:49,650
[SPEAKER_13]: But all the people who got SARS, it's been from traveling to somewhere else.

1709
01:52:49,810 --> 01:52:57,294
[SPEAKER_13]: None of the actual disease or whatever it is, hasn't been from people sitting in their own house or going to like clubs or stuff.

1710
01:52:57,654 --> 01:53:01,196
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to go to somewhere where it's been, you know.

1711
01:53:01,736 --> 01:53:05,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Like people, somebody flew into LA and that's how somebody in LA got it.

1712
01:53:05,078 --> 01:53:06,619
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway.

1713
01:53:06,659 --> 01:53:06,939
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway.

1714
01:53:07,506 --> 01:53:12,068
[SPEAKER_13]: The point is, it's not SARS because I know a lot of people who've gotten sick and they all got better within about three or four days.

1715
01:53:13,688 --> 01:53:15,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you for being way too serious.

1716
01:53:15,569 --> 01:53:16,970
[SPEAKER_06]: God damn, it was a fucking joke.

1717
01:53:17,330 --> 01:53:22,011
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's because my better half is very sick right now and it would suck if that was SARS, okay?

1718
01:53:22,272 --> 01:53:23,812
[SPEAKER_13]: It wouldn't be a funny laughing matter.

1719
01:53:25,573 --> 01:53:28,634
[SPEAKER_14]: Has Irene been to Hong Kong lately?

1720
01:53:32,215 --> 01:53:33,396
[SPEAKER_14]: You know we're right, okay.

1721
01:53:33,856 --> 01:53:34,696
[SPEAKER_13]: That was my point.

1722
01:53:34,896 --> 01:53:36,457
[SPEAKER_14]: Japan Man would like to say...

[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck my computer.

1728
01:53:45,042 --> 01:53:47,463

01:53:52,164 --> 01:53:53,124

1732
01:53:54,384 --> 01:53:55,604
[SPEAKER_14]: And fuck flat-faced on it.

1733
01:53:55,684 --> 01:53:56,504
[SPEAKER_14]: I have no idea.

1734
01:53:57,264 --> 01:54:01,045
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1735
01:54:01,385 --> 01:54:03,766
[SPEAKER_14]: SkylineDC505 says, F you to hormones.

1736
01:54:03,886 --> 01:54:04,346
[SPEAKER_14]: Nuff said.

1737
01:54:04,846 --> 01:54:05,126
Mm-hmm.

1738
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:15,248
[SPEAKER_14]: Shadow would like to say, right now, the only FU I have right now, I hate not being able to find a nice, quiet place with my girlfriend.

1739
01:54:15,288 --> 01:54:18,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck people for being around to nose around and spoil the mood.

1740

[SPEAKER_04]: Until you go to your house.

1741
01:54:22,314 --> 01:54:23,815
[SPEAKER_14]: You live in a damn forest!

1742
01:54:24,335 --> 01:54:25,016
[SPEAKER_14]: Shit, man!

[SPEAKER_14]: Trees!

[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, there's roads that go nowhere.

1747
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:31,221
[SPEAKER_14]: The roads that parallel each other.

[SPEAKER_14]: All right, FUs are over, yay.

1751
01:54:50,045 --> 01:54:51,286
[SPEAKER_14]: Now would be an excellent time.

1752
01:54:55,927 --> 01:55:00,769
[SPEAKER_14]: I think now we're going to talk about the Orange Lounge cage match.

1755
01:55:04,588 --> 01:55:22,716
[SPEAKER_14]: Last week, last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, quite a controversy breaks out over the song that won, which was a band called Freeze Pop, with a song called Science Genius Girl, and that was the song they did in Frequency.

1756
01:55:24,136 --> 01:55:28,018
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, Zero and Tao, Shivam, got into it.

1757
01:55:28,638 --> 01:55:31,620
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, I made them hug when it was all over.

1758
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:33,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you like that, Rob?

1759
01:55:34,041 --> 01:55:34,681
[SPEAKER_14]: It turned me on.

1760
01:55:34,701 --> 01:55:35,882
[SPEAKER_14]: A little bit of man-on-man action there.

1761
01:55:35,902 --> 01:55:36,502
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you join in?

1762
01:55:37,162 --> 01:55:37,963
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I did not join in.

1763
01:55:39,984 --> 01:55:50,409
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, as for that whole little argument we got in, we were actually talking in IRC, and I admitted that, yeah, I do like some freeze-flop songs, but I absolutely can't stand that, and we made up and we're friends again.

1764
01:55:52,522 --> 01:55:52,682
[SPEAKER_14]: Aw.

1765
01:55:53,343 --> 01:55:54,423
[SPEAKER_14]: You made out in your friends again?

1766
01:55:54,563 --> 01:55:55,664
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you made out in your friends again.

[SPEAKER_14]: We had dead air just there.

1781
01:57:49,086 --> 01:57:52,273
[SPEAKER_14]: I had the stuff muted because people were talking over that last one.

1782
01:57:52,573 --> 01:57:54,157
[SPEAKER_14]: You're gonna have to introduce the song again real fast.

01:57:54,197 --> 01:57:54,638
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry about that.

1784
01:57:55,385 --> 01:58:01,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let me run the title through one more time, because I need to give actually the name of the mix.

1785
01:58:01,989 --> 01:58:03,930
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Eminem mixed by DJ Tripp.

1786
01:58:04,170 --> 01:58:06,171
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Without Me, Dark Side of the Force mix.

1787
01:58:06,611 --> 01:58:08,052
[SPEAKER_14]: And where did you find this?

1788
01:58:08,692 --> 01:58:13,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he brought the CD with it over to my house, and I ripped it.

1789
01:58:14,435 --> 01:58:19,538
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Tripp is one of my fiancé's good friends, and he's a DJ in Santa Cruz.

1790
01:58:19,638 --> 01:58:22,460
[SPEAKER_04]: And apparently his stuff's been played on Quad locally before.

1791
01:58:26,084 --> 01:58:29,769
[SPEAKER_14]: And usually we don't care for Eminem, but this is a remix.

1792
01:58:31,011 --> 01:58:32,473
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, here we go.

1793
01:58:32,733 --> 01:58:35,297
[SPEAKER_14]: This is Eminem mixed by DJ Tripp with Without Me.

1794
01:59:35,080 --> 02:00:03,962
[SPEAKER_15]: I created a monster, cause nobody wants to see Marcel no more, they want Shady, I'm top livin' Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor, some vodka that'll jumpstart my heart We'll get in a shock when I get stopped at the hospital by the doctor when I'm not cooperating When I'm rockin' at table while he's operating You waited this long to stop debating, cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating I know that you got a job, Miss Chaney, but your husband's heart problem's complicating So the FCC won't let me be, you'll let me be me, so

1795
02:00:39,670 --> 02:00:42,754
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1796
02:01:16,390 --> 02:01:44,610
[SPEAKER_15]: You said for me, now this looks like a job for me So everybody just follow me Cause we need a little controversy Cause it feels so empty without me I said this looks like a job for me So everybody just follow me Cause we need a little controversy Cause it feels so empty without me A biscuit, a tasket, I will sit the task with Anybody who's talking this shit, that shit Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked Worse in the middle than biscuit bastards And Moby, you can get stoned

1797
02:01:45,503 --> 02:01:47,524
[SPEAKER_15]: 36-year-old boy had a bag load.

1798
02:01:47,744 --> 02:01:50,064
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't know me, it's too old, let's go, it's over.

1799
02:01:50,224 --> 02:01:52,325
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody listen to techno, now let's go.

1800
02:01:52,625 --> 02:01:54,766
[SPEAKER_15]: Just give me the signal, I'll be there with a hold.

1801
02:01:54,846 --> 02:01:56,586
[SPEAKER_15]: It's full of new insults, I've been don't.

1802
02:01:56,746 --> 02:02:00,508
[SPEAKER_15]: Suspenseful with a pistol ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol.

1803
02:02:00,528 --> 02:02:04,369
But sometimes it just seems everybody only wants to discuss me.

1804
02:02:04,549 --> 02:02:06,469
So this must mean I'm disgusting.

1805
02:02:06,689 --> 02:02:08,410
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's just me, I'm just a scene.

1806
02:03:10,828 --> 02:03:14,356
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, that was Eminem remixed by DJ Trip, a song called Without Me.

1807
02:03:14,436 --> 02:03:16,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Now we go around the room and see what everyone thought.

1808
02:03:16,861 --> 02:03:17,122
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie?

1809
02:03:18,825 --> 02:03:18,845
[SPEAKER_04]: I...

1810
02:03:19,608 --> 02:03:25,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Personally, I mean, I more or less really like it just because he's a cool guy, you know, he's a fan friend.

1811
02:03:27,692 --> 02:03:44,700
[SPEAKER_04]: That, I look at the overall presentation, because if you think about it, a lot of what, you know, rap that you hear nowadays is just, you know, more of the same specific stuff, so I think it's kind of neat to hear it done a little differently, and I like how it flows together, so, you know.

1812
02:03:45,638 --> 02:03:49,159
[SPEAKER_04]: I give it a 9, personally.

1813
02:03:50,579 --> 02:03:51,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Zero?

1814
02:03:53,940 --> 02:03:57,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, I am really not an Eminem fan at all.

1815
02:03:57,721 --> 02:04:00,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody who knows me knows I absolutely hate him.

1816
02:04:00,902 --> 02:04:07,503
[SPEAKER_11]: But I've actually seen DJ Trip one time in Underground, and I thought he was really good, and everything only gets better from this song.

1817
02:04:07,983 --> 02:04:14,245
[SPEAKER_11]: But on this song, based alone, I give it an 8, because it was done pretty well.

1818
02:04:14,345 --> 02:04:15,005
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving on, Loki.

1819
02:04:15,700 --> 02:04:17,541
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I'd like to hear more of his stuff.

1820
02:04:18,402 --> 02:04:22,044
[SPEAKER_24]: I do like Eminem, but that remix was simple.

1821
02:04:22,584 --> 02:04:23,284
[SPEAKER_24]: It was simple.

1822
02:04:23,304 --> 02:04:24,245
[SPEAKER_24]: It was an acapella track.

1823
02:04:24,265 --> 02:04:28,627
[SPEAKER_24]: You take some stuff from the Star Wars soundtrack, and you take a breakbeat, and that's about it.

1824
02:04:29,708 --> 02:04:33,470
[SPEAKER_24]: It was put together a little hastily, it sounds like, and, I mean, it could have been better.

1825
02:04:33,490 --> 02:04:34,471
[SPEAKER_24]: It could have been better.

1826
02:04:34,491 --> 02:04:43,076
[SPEAKER_14]: He could have done some stuff to vocals, you know, maybe remix that a little bit, but it was pretty simple, and it sort of went... It was... Overall, I mean, you gotta have to understand...

1827
02:04:43,909 --> 02:04:47,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Even some of the most simplest stuff works, but I'm going to have to give it a 7.

1828
02:04:50,633 --> 02:04:51,373
[SPEAKER_14]: DDRholic?

1829
02:04:51,393 --> 02:04:54,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, yeah.

1830
02:04:54,955 --> 02:04:56,837
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to give it a pretty decent score.

1831
02:04:56,937 --> 02:04:58,578
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounded really cool.

1832
02:04:59,138 --> 02:05:01,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Put together well, as far as I can tell.

1833
02:05:02,020 --> 02:05:04,661
[SPEAKER_05]: I really don't know that much about putting those things together.

1834
02:05:05,522 --> 02:05:09,444
[SPEAKER_05]: But if Loki says it wasn't that difficult, then I'll believe that too.

1835
02:05:10,024 --> 02:05:17,966
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I really like about it is that it put visions in my head of Darth Vader doing hip-hop dancing with the stormtroopers behind him.

1836
02:05:18,567 --> 02:05:21,628
[SPEAKER_05]: And like titles like DJ Vader.

1837
02:05:21,748 --> 02:05:26,389
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the big-tittied girls in the back with the Princess Leia hair going, Oh yeah, baby!

1838
02:05:26,409 --> 02:05:32,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, with the DJ Vader, Hoochie Mama girls, and the stormtroopers featuring...

1839
02:05:33,411 --> 02:05:37,253
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Jazzy, Emperor Jeff, and you know, all that kind of stuff.

1840
02:05:37,293 --> 02:05:40,314
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the octopus-headed race doing stuff.

1841
02:05:41,034 --> 02:05:44,015
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen the part two yet.

1842
02:05:45,956 --> 02:05:46,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue Nose Guy.

1843
02:05:46,557 --> 02:05:49,098
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy with the blue nose playing the synth and doing scratching in the background.

1844
02:05:49,358 --> 02:05:51,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the band from Jabba the Hutt.

1845
02:05:52,039 --> 02:05:53,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1846
02:05:54,600 --> 02:05:55,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the Blue Nose Guy.

1847
02:05:55,820 --> 02:05:57,161
[SPEAKER_05]: They look like an elephant thing.

1848
02:05:59,969 --> 02:06:05,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so, you know, I could have maybe done a little bit more with it, added some stuff to it, but it was pretty neat.

1849
02:06:05,196 --> 02:06:05,696
[SPEAKER_05]: I liked it.

1850
02:06:05,937 --> 02:06:06,457
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll call it an 8.

1851
02:06:07,198 --> 02:06:07,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give it an 8.

1852
02:06:08,820 --> 02:06:09,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1853
02:06:10,282 --> 02:06:15,028
[SPEAKER_14]: As for me, I don't like Eminem, and I don't like Star Wars.

1854
02:06:15,248 --> 02:06:18,492
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they're two of the most overrated things in modern American culture.

1855
02:06:19,417 --> 02:06:22,738
[SPEAKER_14]: But, when they come together, it's not so bad.

1856
02:06:22,838 --> 02:06:24,459
[SPEAKER_14]: That really wasn't that bad.

1857
02:06:24,539 --> 02:06:26,219
[SPEAKER_14]: I kind of like it, actually.

1858
02:06:26,339 --> 02:06:30,200
[SPEAKER_14]: It's better than the original track.

1859
02:06:30,220 --> 02:06:32,101
[SPEAKER_14]: The music in Star Wars was actually always pretty good.

1860
02:06:32,121 --> 02:06:32,981
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just the movies I don't like.

1861
02:06:33,361 --> 02:06:36,282
[SPEAKER_14]: So, seven and a half, overall.

1862
02:06:36,902 --> 02:06:38,083
[SPEAKER_05]: So two wrongs make a right.

1863
02:06:38,423 --> 02:06:40,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so two wrongs in this case do make a right, yes.

1864
02:06:41,944 --> 02:06:42,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Three less do.

1865
02:06:47,973 --> 02:06:52,875
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, that's what we have to say on Eminem mixed by DJ Trip without me.

1866
02:06:52,975 --> 02:06:54,715
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, Loki, what did we hear last?

1867
02:06:55,815 --> 02:06:58,396
[SPEAKER_24]: We get to hear a song by this group called Hamperberg.

1868
02:07:00,097 --> 02:07:08,259
[SPEAKER_24]: I was introduced to this song by our friend Eric, Punk Knight, and it's called Duck Toy, and you'll see why.

1869
02:07:09,360 --> 02:07:10,640
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm very scared, but here it is.

1870
02:07:10,700 --> 02:07:12,401
[SPEAKER_14]: This is Hamperberg with Duck Toy.

1871
02:07:12,801 --> 02:07:13,121
[SPEAKER_14]: Enjoy.

1872
02:09:32,638 --> 02:09:43,024
[SPEAKER_19]: I want it, I need it, oh yeah, I want it

1873
02:10:42,366 --> 02:10:45,287
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, that was Hamperberg with Duck Toy.

1874
02:10:45,307 --> 02:10:47,808
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the last song you can vote for in tonight's cage match.

1875
02:10:47,828 --> 02:10:49,989
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go around and see what everyone thought about that one, Jamie.

1876
02:10:51,730 --> 02:10:52,390
[SPEAKER_04]: It gave me a headache.

1877
02:10:52,810 --> 02:10:53,610
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was cool.

1878
02:10:53,730 --> 02:10:54,411
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really neat.

1879
02:10:54,791 --> 02:10:55,511
[SPEAKER_04]: But it gave me a headache.

1880
02:10:56,764 --> 02:11:04,986
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and then there was like, when that woman started talking and making moaning noises, my response was, meanwhile, in another song.

1881
02:11:05,506 --> 02:11:09,067
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, um, I get the, I get the seven.

1882
02:11:10,647 --> 02:11:11,528
[SPEAKER_04]: But it still gave me headaches.

1883
02:11:11,948 --> 02:11:12,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

1884
02:11:16,229 --> 02:11:16,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero?

1885
02:11:16,769 --> 02:11:26,071
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, as we all stare at the bondage for it, um, I don't know, okay, the beginning of that song sounded like a bad bowel movement.

1886
02:11:26,798 --> 02:11:47,376
[SPEAKER_11]: and then it moved into making me laugh my ass off once the rubber duckie started going and then all of a sudden it just switched songs and started going into a chick started off with something that sounds like you bastard um, all together that song really confused me and it might as well have had the smell of the sound it started with I would give it like a 4

1887
02:11:49,824 --> 02:11:50,945
[SPEAKER_24]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network,

1888
02:12:12,509 --> 02:12:15,170
[SPEAKER_24]: I wonder if I can make a song with this duck.

1889
02:12:16,710 --> 02:12:19,031
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll make a techno song with this rubber ducky.

1890
02:12:19,111 --> 02:12:21,312
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, it's just, it was funny.

1891
02:12:22,292 --> 02:12:22,932
[SPEAKER_14]: DDRholic?

1892
02:12:24,013 --> 02:12:25,413
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was really funny too.

1893
02:12:25,453 --> 02:12:28,154
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a killer, killer duck.

1894
02:12:28,234 --> 02:12:30,315
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who, what kind of, if it was really a duck.

1895
02:12:30,355 --> 02:12:34,216
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like a dog toy to me, but it could have been a dog toy duck, whatever.

1896
02:12:35,416 --> 02:12:38,818
[SPEAKER_05]: That song brought to mind erotic imagery of Bert and Ernie, and for that it gets a 6.9.

1897
02:13:05,924 --> 02:13:06,925
[SPEAKER_05]: 6.9, what does that mean?

1898
02:13:07,185 --> 02:13:07,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1899
02:13:09,146 --> 02:13:10,546
[SPEAKER_05]: That means it's getting some.

1900
02:13:12,007 --> 02:13:16,129
[SPEAKER_14]: You can send in your votes now and here are the three songs you can vote for in tonight's cage match.

1901
02:13:16,209 --> 02:13:18,490
[SPEAKER_14]: Last week's winner, Freeze Pop with Science Genius Girl.

1902
02:13:24,432 --> 02:13:28,994
[SPEAKER_14]: This is Eminem mixed by DJ Trip with Without Me.

1903
02:13:40,229 --> 02:13:41,930
[SPEAKER_14]: and Hamperberg with DuckToy.

1904
02:13:50,893 --> 02:13:54,715
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, you can vote for either one of those three songs right now.

1905
02:13:55,375 --> 02:13:56,455
[SPEAKER_14]: Right freaking now.

1906
02:13:57,816 --> 02:14:01,497
[SPEAKER_14]: Send those votes to me, private message, Sky, in the chat room.

1907
02:14:02,778 --> 02:14:07,900
[SPEAKER_14]: And some folks in the chat room saying all three songs suck this week and they're not voting.

1908
02:14:10,807 --> 02:14:13,568
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll be damn glad I was going to play the Kyle Snyder song again, okay?

1909
02:14:15,069 --> 02:14:15,869
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right, you know what?

1910
02:14:15,989 --> 02:14:20,491
[SPEAKER_14]: I said last week, I wasn't planning on winning that last week.

1911
02:14:20,551 --> 02:14:21,592
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't think I was going to win with that.

1912
02:14:22,312 --> 02:14:23,733
[SPEAKER_14]: And I said I was going to play the Kyle Snyder song.

1913
02:14:23,753 --> 02:14:28,235
[SPEAKER_04]: You're required to vote, or I will be angry with you.

1914
02:14:29,005 --> 02:14:29,486
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh-oh.

1915
02:14:30,847 --> 02:14:32,429
[SPEAKER_04]: And you don't want me to be angry with you.

1916
02:14:33,971 --> 02:14:34,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay?

1917
02:14:34,791 --> 02:14:35,172
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1918
02:14:37,374 --> 02:14:41,259
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to take... Well, I don't really want to take a break, so we need to talk about something else.

1919
02:14:42,800 --> 02:14:43,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I break something?

1920
02:14:43,941 --> 02:14:44,182
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1921
02:14:45,752 --> 02:14:46,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have anything to break.

1922
02:14:46,613 --> 02:14:47,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't break the bottle lid again.

1923
02:14:48,394 --> 02:14:49,675
[SPEAKER_14]: Zero, do you want to talk about video games?

1924
02:14:49,695 --> 02:14:51,116
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have a review you want to give us?

1925
02:14:51,416 --> 02:14:52,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

1926
02:14:52,416 --> 02:14:54,037
[SPEAKER_11]: I can try to throw something together here.

1927
02:14:54,298 --> 02:14:59,561
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't fully prepared, but Kingdom Hearts 2 does actually sound decent.

1928
02:14:59,881 --> 02:15:02,843
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't wait to at least see a good demo of it.

1929
02:15:03,804 --> 02:15:03,964
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1930
02:15:05,800 --> 02:15:06,701
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, finish Kingdom Hearts?

1931
02:15:07,161 --> 02:15:07,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I'm almost done.

1932
02:15:07,961 --> 02:15:14,444
[SPEAKER_11]: I just beat Agrabah, but I've been playing The Getaway lately, which is on my review list, even though it's kind of not really a new game.

1933
02:15:14,544 --> 02:15:16,245
[SPEAKER_11]: But, um, I don't know.

1934
02:15:16,425 --> 02:15:18,006
[SPEAKER_11]: The gameplay of that game is cool.

1935
02:15:18,306 --> 02:15:19,687
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of sketchy sometimes.

1936
02:15:21,616 --> 02:15:25,699
[SPEAKER_11]: All the character models are really good until they start moving.

1937
02:15:26,459 --> 02:15:30,522
[SPEAKER_11]: When they start moving, it looks like a bad epileptic seizure or something.

1938
02:15:31,483 --> 02:15:39,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes it's really smooth, and the other times they start doing the whole classic PS1 movies where it's all real blotchy and jittery.

1939
02:15:39,648 --> 02:15:46,792
[SPEAKER_11]: The gameplay is good, the story is good, involving, nor have I ever heard a game use the word fuck so many times in 10 minutes.

1940
02:15:47,293 --> 02:15:52,035
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just fucking this, fucking that, and it's all in an English accent, so either way you'll get to laugh pretty well.

1941
02:15:53,036 --> 02:15:57,639
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they get away.

1942
02:15:58,699 --> 02:16:02,982
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the mission objectives are kind of hard to understand, you can't understand what the fuck they're telling you to do.

1943
02:16:03,826 --> 02:16:05,487
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you're not speaking English English.

1944
02:16:06,748 --> 02:16:13,232
[SPEAKER_11]: I talked to my friend in the UK, and they said, and I was talking to him, and he's all, I can't understand you, he's all, why don't you speak English?

1945
02:16:13,272 --> 02:16:13,813
[SPEAKER_11]: I said, I am.

1946
02:16:14,133 --> 02:16:14,453
[SPEAKER_11]: You're not.

1947
02:16:14,593 --> 02:16:14,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways.

1948
02:16:16,134 --> 02:16:18,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Another game is, oh yeah, a big one right now.

1949
02:16:19,156 --> 02:16:19,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Automodelista.

1950
02:16:20,977 --> 02:16:23,159
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a couple- Did you just say Automolesta?

1951
02:16:24,454 --> 02:16:25,555
[SPEAKER_11]: Santa Moleste Nente

1952
02:16:55,177 --> 02:16:56,998
[SPEAKER_11]: That means to be good at it, you don't play it.

1953
02:17:18,467 --> 02:17:22,951
[SPEAKER_11]: But you will get annoyed with it very quickly if you don't like the staring.

1954
02:17:23,031 --> 02:17:24,612
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of a hit or miss thing.

1955
02:17:25,173 --> 02:17:27,835
[SPEAKER_11]: As for the Xbox, I really don't have anything up my sleeve right now.

1956
02:17:28,255 --> 02:17:29,896
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't had a chance to play anything.

1957
02:17:31,498 --> 02:17:33,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Save up $200, get Steel Battalion.

1958
02:17:33,279 --> 02:17:33,259
$200?

1959
02:17:34,200 --> 02:17:36,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Why don't I just play it at your house?

1960
02:17:38,023 --> 02:17:40,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Steel Battalion will make anyone feel manly.

1961
02:17:41,505 --> 02:17:45,909
[SPEAKER_04]: When you sit in front of this gigantic controller, it makes you feel like you have the world's biggest penis.

1962
02:17:48,610 --> 02:18:15,885
[SPEAKER_11]: as Brad comes in and demonstrates um yeah another one for those of you who haven't played Xenos Saga go pick it up because you'll enjoy it there are really no good fighting games out right now except for all the classics um GameCube games still play Zelda it's a good quality game you'll kind of laugh at first when you see all the little cartoony figures and stuff um

1963
02:18:18,123 --> 02:18:21,524
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see, Metroid Prime, still play it, even if you haven't.

1964
02:18:22,884 --> 02:18:25,484
[SPEAKER_11]: That's about it for right now until I start playing more.

1965
02:18:25,544 --> 02:18:28,065
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that I have a job, I'll be able to actually play more games.

1966
02:18:28,085 --> 02:18:30,806
[SPEAKER_11]: But I gotta go over to your house and play games at your house because you have a bunch.

1967
02:18:33,506 --> 02:18:36,507
[SPEAKER_04]: And then more of you need to play Phantasy Star Online with me and Rob.

1968
02:18:37,507 --> 02:18:39,927
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, and I need to get my broadband adapter thing back.

1969
02:18:41,668 --> 02:18:44,908
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'll be able to play it as Rob's character when we move in.

1970
02:18:46,149 --> 02:18:47,909
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you can put up to four characters on one card.

1971
02:18:52,622 --> 02:18:56,624
[SPEAKER_04]: My character for Phantasy Star Online looks like she's 12 and has these big pink pigtails.

1972
02:18:59,506 --> 02:18:59,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Bless you.

1973
02:18:59,826 --> 02:19:02,348
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought you were going to say big pink boobs, sorry.

1974
02:19:03,368 --> 02:19:03,909
[SPEAKER_04]: That's you.

1975
02:19:05,489 --> 02:19:11,553
[SPEAKER_11]: But next week, this week I have a few games that I'm going to get a hold of and play and see what they do.

1976
02:19:11,613 --> 02:19:16,936
[SPEAKER_11]: So next week, or whatever week we do it again, I'm going to have a lot better of a review.

1977
02:19:17,962 --> 02:19:18,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Still play Clock Tower 3.

1978
02:19:19,824 --> 02:19:24,148
[SPEAKER_04]: If you haven't played Clock Tower 3, I'm going to come and like... Well, I'm not going to play it, but I just want to see all the cutscenes.

1979
02:19:24,688 --> 02:19:27,931
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to send that little bloody girl over to kill you.

1980
02:19:29,212 --> 02:19:32,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, you know, she was from Battle Royale and she'll kill you.

1981
02:19:32,415 --> 02:19:37,159
[SPEAKER_11]: If anyone's ever seen the actual article for it, it's got the survivor of the first game.

1982
02:19:37,219 --> 02:19:38,240
[SPEAKER_11]: I will send her over to kill you.

1983
02:19:38,600 --> 02:19:39,621
[SPEAKER_11]: Because she's pretty hardcore.

1984
02:19:40,622 --> 02:19:41,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and she has that creepy smile.

1985
02:19:42,549 --> 02:19:43,410
[SPEAKER_11]: And she has a bear.

1986
02:19:44,331 --> 02:19:45,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Or a little doll.

1987
02:19:45,412 --> 02:19:52,819
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know, every movie where they have dolls, they're always the biggest killers.

1988
02:19:53,360 --> 02:19:54,701
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, I can't wait.

1989
02:19:56,423 --> 02:19:57,224
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna have a doll.

1990
02:19:58,045 --> 02:19:58,986
[SPEAKER_11]: It's gonna be the Loki doll.

1991
02:19:59,206 --> 02:19:59,887
[SPEAKER_11]: It's gonna be a monkey.

1992
02:20:02,639 --> 02:20:04,560
[SPEAKER_11]: They're like, Monkey, kill him.

1993
02:20:05,400 --> 02:20:16,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, I'd like to remind our listeners that probably in about a month or so, we're going to be running a Battle Royale tabletop style game over IRC.

1994
02:20:16,565 --> 02:20:17,846
[SPEAKER_04]: You will have stats.

1995
02:20:18,586 --> 02:20:23,708
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have the details published somewhere soon, possibly on DarkSakura.com.

1996
02:20:24,089 --> 02:20:26,810
[SPEAKER_11]: You still have to teach me how to play so I can join in.

1997
02:20:27,510 --> 02:20:28,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone will have to learn how to play.

1998
02:20:28,571 --> 02:20:29,371
[SPEAKER_04]: We're making up the rules.

1999
02:20:29,451 --> 02:20:29,912
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, good.

2000
02:20:29,992 --> 02:20:30,712
[SPEAKER_11]: Then you'll have to teach me.

2001
02:20:30,732 --> 02:20:31,633
[SPEAKER_11]: I win.

2002
02:20:31,693 --> 02:20:32,473
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you don't win.

2003
02:20:33,274 --> 02:20:37,336
[SPEAKER_04]: I will go ahead and reveal a couple of little tiny things that aren't major secrets.

2004
02:20:37,757 --> 02:20:39,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I be the guy?

2005
02:20:39,418 --> 02:20:43,320
[SPEAKER_04]: You know the guy that does the thing?

2006
02:20:43,901 --> 02:20:49,104
[SPEAKER_04]: You will be allowed to have a proficiency, but some proficiencies will be assigned, and one of the proficiencies is lucky bitch power.

2007
02:20:49,966 --> 02:20:53,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and Dark Child and I will actually be playing a lot of games this week.

2008
02:20:54,209 --> 02:20:57,651
[SPEAKER_11]: He's kind of like the other guy behind my reviews and such.

2009
02:20:57,792 --> 02:21:01,954
[SPEAKER_11]: So this week we'll try to at least get eight games and try to run them and see what happens.

2010
02:21:02,855 --> 02:21:04,776
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's all I got right now, but next week will be better.

2011
02:21:05,997 --> 02:21:08,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a review for Dracula X for the PC Engine Duo.

2012
02:21:08,859 --> 02:21:09,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Best game ever.

2013
02:21:10,300 --> 02:21:12,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Go save up the $300 and buy it.

2014
02:21:12,902 --> 02:21:14,243
[SPEAKER_24]: I have a review for E.T.

2015
02:21:14,263 --> 02:21:14,443
[SPEAKER_24]: for the 2600.

2016
02:21:14,543 --> 02:21:15,104
[SPEAKER_24]: Best game ever.

2017
02:21:15,144 --> 02:21:15,284
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

2018
02:21:19,240 --> 02:21:20,801
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a five word review for that.

2019
02:21:21,321 --> 02:21:22,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, no, an eight word review.

2020
02:21:23,281 --> 02:21:25,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass.

2021
02:21:26,602 --> 02:21:28,663
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, Jamie likes the ass.

2022
02:21:29,823 --> 02:21:30,723
[SPEAKER_11]: I have two words for you.

2023
02:21:30,983 --> 02:21:31,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Attack.

2024
02:21:32,544 --> 02:21:32,864
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

2025
02:21:33,684 --> 02:21:34,624
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, for the new E.T.

2026
02:21:34,664 --> 02:21:37,025
[SPEAKER_11]: coming out, the best part is, it's not out.

2027
02:21:38,765 --> 02:21:39,306
[SPEAKER_11]: But it will be.

2028
02:21:41,626 --> 02:21:44,887
[SPEAKER_11]: The best part will be when you don't turn on your console to play it.

2029
02:21:46,374 --> 02:21:48,354
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I think now's a good time to take a break.

2030
02:21:48,875 --> 02:21:50,375
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2031
02:21:51,595 --> 02:21:52,075
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2032
02:21:53,976 --> 02:22:02,518
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, this break, since the last break we did all these songs that start with A, I thought it would be only appropriate to do songs that start with X, Y, and Z. Anal sex.

2033
02:22:03,198 --> 02:22:03,878
[SPEAKER_14]: So here we go.

2034
02:22:04,178 --> 02:22:04,798
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be right back.

2035
02:22:06,899 --> 02:22:07,359
Anal sex.

2036
02:22:50,742 --> 02:22:51,584
Thanks for watching!

2037
02:25:18,997 --> 02:25:19,862
Thanks for watching!

2038
02:27:04,284 --> 02:27:08,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we're setting up now for Orange Lounge match game we're going to play tonight.

2039
02:27:09,006 --> 02:27:12,046
[SPEAKER_14]: But we have to jot down some questions really fast and get all the celebrities prepped.

2040
02:27:12,206 --> 02:27:13,387
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have to get some contestants.

2041
02:27:13,447 --> 02:27:21,109
[SPEAKER_14]: So, the contestants that will be playing match game tonight will be the first two folks in the chat room who can answer me this question.

2042
02:27:21,849 --> 02:27:23,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Jamie's going to get good because I don't.

2043
02:27:25,731 --> 02:27:27,291
[SPEAKER_04]: What is Jamie's favorite shooting game?

2044
02:27:27,711 --> 02:27:28,632
[SPEAKER_14]: No, that's stupid.

2045
02:27:28,692 --> 02:27:29,952
[SPEAKER_14]: Will people be able to get that though?

2046
02:27:29,992 --> 02:27:31,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, because I've said it a bajillion times.

2047
02:27:32,353 --> 02:27:33,033
[SPEAKER_14]: What's your question?

2048
02:27:33,801 --> 02:27:36,143
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's the artist that did Dead End?

2049
02:27:36,163 --> 02:27:37,864
And the actual artist, not Naoki.

2050
02:27:39,246 --> 02:27:41,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so you have to answer both those questions.

2051
02:27:42,348 --> 02:27:44,510
[SPEAKER_14]: A. Who is the artist that did Deadline?

2052
02:27:46,951 --> 02:27:50,933
[SPEAKER_14]: Dead End A. Who is the artist that did Dead End, not Deadline?

2053
02:27:51,173 --> 02:27:55,296
[SPEAKER_14]: That's question A. And B. What is Jamie's favorite shooter?

2054
02:27:55,436 --> 02:27:57,017
[SPEAKER_14]: She's said it a million times on this show.

2055
02:27:57,298 --> 02:28:03,682
[SPEAKER_14]: If we don't have anyone that gets A and B right, I think A is a little easier, so we'll use A as the answer and B as a tiebreaker.

2056
02:28:04,682 --> 02:28:08,945
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Jamie's favorite shooter and the artist that did Dead End.

2057
02:28:09,606 --> 02:28:09,886
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

2058
02:28:11,702 --> 02:28:16,425
[SPEAKER_14]: And in the meantime, we're going to play a nice little song to prep us all for match game.

2059
02:28:18,146 --> 02:28:22,248
[SPEAKER_14]: And that song will be Dr. Bombay, because this show needs help.

2060
02:28:22,668 --> 02:28:25,230
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think this is also an inside joke with Jamie and Maren right now.

2061
02:28:25,270 --> 02:28:26,231
[SPEAKER_14]: At least I pick up on that.

2062
02:28:26,951 --> 02:28:27,291
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not?

2063
02:28:27,631 --> 02:28:28,332
[SPEAKER_14]: It has nothing to do with it.

2064
02:28:28,352 --> 02:28:31,033
[SPEAKER_14]: But I mean, the name of the song, if you say it as a word, does.

2065
02:28:32,734 --> 02:28:33,635
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of dual meaning.

2066
02:28:34,475 --> 02:28:35,016
Dr. Bombay

2067
02:29:06,929 --> 02:29:07,952

[SPEAKER_14]: Orange Lounge Radio.

2069
02:32:08,581 --> 02:32:10,723
[SPEAKER_14]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

2070
02:32:11,544 --> 02:32:15,707
[SPEAKER_14]: This server made a bit of money, yeah, number... This server made a bit of money, yeah, number...

2071
02:32:17,240 --> 02:32:32,091
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, we are back, and let's get to the winner of the match, or not the match game, we don't know that yet, but the winner of the cage match tonight, sad but true, you voted DuckToy as the winner of tonight's cage match.

2072
02:32:38,115 --> 02:32:38,635
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, boy.

2073
02:32:40,957 --> 02:32:41,858
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's just say that again.

2074
02:32:42,418 --> 02:32:44,220
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds like some strange Vietnamese soup.

2075
02:32:44,420 --> 02:32:45,741
[SPEAKER_05]: DuckToy, I want DuckToy.

2076
02:32:49,029 --> 02:32:51,830
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay, because I can bring the other Freeze Pop song next week.

2077
02:32:55,032 --> 02:32:55,352
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

2078
02:32:57,433 --> 02:32:59,774
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so now let's talk about contestants for match game.

2079
02:33:00,494 --> 02:33:03,216
[SPEAKER_14]: Nobody got both questions right.

2080
02:33:04,976 --> 02:33:09,298
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, but we have people that got one right, and we have people that got the other one right, but nobody got them both right.

2081
02:33:09,798 --> 02:33:14,160
[SPEAKER_14]: So, first off, the person who got Jamie's favorite shooter question correct, Jamie.

2082
02:33:14,240 --> 02:33:15,181
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the favorite shooter?

2083
02:33:15,201 --> 02:33:15,361
[SPEAKER_14]: Shooter.

2084
02:33:17,370 --> 02:33:17,730
[SPEAKER_14]: Shooter.

2085
02:33:18,471 --> 02:33:19,292
[SPEAKER_14]: Shooter.

2086
02:33:19,452 --> 02:33:20,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Radiant Silvergun.

2087
02:33:20,953 --> 02:33:25,616
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, for you people who try to name Doom and Hexen, those are first-person shooters.

2088
02:33:25,636 --> 02:33:26,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are not shooting games.

2089
02:33:26,577 --> 02:33:27,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are first-person shooters.

2090
02:33:27,718 --> 02:33:28,398
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a difference.

2091
02:33:29,159 --> 02:33:34,083
[SPEAKER_04]: A shooter is like Gradius or Parodius or Radiant Silvergun.

2092
02:33:35,083 --> 02:33:35,524
[SPEAKER_04]: And R-Type.

2093
02:33:35,604 --> 02:33:36,184
[SPEAKER_04]: R-Type's awesome.

2094
02:33:36,624 --> 02:33:39,106
[SPEAKER_04]: But Radiant Silvergun is my favorite shooting game.

2095
02:33:39,787 --> 02:33:41,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Followed closely by Osha Berry Parodius.

2096
02:33:42,068 --> 02:33:46,652
[SPEAKER_14]: So Dark Tetsuya was the only one to name Radiant Silvergun as Jamie's favorite shooter, so he's in by default.

2097
02:33:47,310 --> 02:33:53,853
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we have Dark Tetsuya versus, and we decided to eliminate all the people that put Hexen in Doom, because that was a pretty good amount of people.

2098
02:33:55,854 --> 02:34:00,536
[SPEAKER_14]: And we were left with somebody who said Gradius, which is kind of like Parodius.

2099
02:34:00,836 --> 02:34:02,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Parodius is a parody of Gradius.

2100
02:34:03,137 --> 02:34:07,239
[SPEAKER_14]: But, oh well, you win by default, so Justin Circuit is contestant number two.

2101
02:34:09,540 --> 02:34:10,600
[SPEAKER_14]: And no one got N and S?

2102
02:34:10,620 --> 02:34:16,643
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of people got N and S. I was talking all the people who, a lot of people got N and S. What's funny is Dark Tetsuya, that's the one question he didn't get.

2103
02:34:17,429 --> 02:34:18,690
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:36:35,137 --> 02:36:38,600
[SPEAKER_14]: Norman the Newbie was so new to DDR.

[SPEAKER_14]: Norman the Newbie was so new to DDR that all the regulars were really getting fed up with his antics and wish he would really stop doing the blank every time he played.

[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, once more.

2150
02:37:57,753 --> 02:38:04,758
[SPEAKER_14]: Norman the Newbie was so new to DDR, but all the regulars were really getting fed up with Xantix and wished he would stop doing the blank every time he played.

[SPEAKER_14]: Justin says,

2159
02:38:48,476 --> 02:38:56,348
[SPEAKER_14]: Norman the Newbie, he was really sick, and wished Norman the Newbie would stop doing the pelvic thrust every time he played.

[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

2161

[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie, what did you say?

2162
02:39:01,909 --> 02:39:02,690
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Truffle Shuffle.

2163
02:39:02,870 --> 02:39:04,192
[SPEAKER_14]: The Truffle Shuffle!

2164
02:39:09,217 --> 02:39:09,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Zero.

2165
02:39:10,979 --> 02:39:15,243
[SPEAKER_11]: I said that he would quit headbanging to Daiken Kai.

2166
02:39:15,664 --> 02:39:19,288
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm tired of all seeing those damn bastards sit there while they're playing Daiken Kai on Easygoing.

2167
02:39:20,734 --> 02:39:22,015
[SPEAKER_11]: It looked like fucking morons.

2168
02:39:22,295 --> 02:39:23,356
[SPEAKER_24]: That was great radio, by the way.

2169
02:39:23,717 --> 02:39:24,297
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I'm sorry.

2170
02:39:24,377 --> 02:39:30,242
[SPEAKER_11]: I was stamping in place and putting the little metal symbol up in the air and headbanging.

2171
02:39:30,582 --> 02:39:32,684
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the stupidest thing in the world, and knock it off.

2172
02:39:34,546 --> 02:39:34,866
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright.

2173

[SPEAKER_24]: Loki.

2174
02:39:39,028 --> 02:39:55,353
[SPEAKER_24]: I said that he would stop singing with the music, basically, actually not really singing, but making noise to the music, like going, woo, woo, to the whistle song, and clapping at odd times, because, you know, newbies, they don't have rhythm in the first place, so they can't keep up with the song.

2175
02:39:55,373 --> 02:39:57,294
[SPEAKER_24]: They're also, woo, woo, oh.

02:40:18,452 --> 02:40:24,396
[SPEAKER_14]: Dark Child... Really wish Norman the Newbie would stop... Doing the... Doing the... Coin slot.

2180
02:40:24,536 --> 02:40:25,076
[SPEAKER_14]: It won't fit.

2181
02:40:27,598 --> 02:40:28,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God.

2182
02:40:28,519 --> 02:40:31,801
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he might be small enough... He might not have a problem with that...

02:42:40,631 --> 02:42:41,252
[SPEAKER_14]: Spit propel.

2212
02:42:42,253 --> 02:42:51,361
[SPEAKER_14]: Justin Circuit said, Zero was so happy when he got his extra stage on DDR Extreme for the first time that he blew up all over the machine.

2213
02:42:53,934 --> 02:42:54,274
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

2214
02:42:55,354 --> 02:42:56,955
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, that could have a lot of reference.

2215
02:42:56,975 --> 02:42:58,455
[SPEAKER_14]: I think he's trying to go for a gimme.

2216
02:42:59,076 --> 02:42:59,516
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie.

2217
02:43:00,896 --> 02:43:03,437
[SPEAKER_04]: He was so happy he... Had a violent bowel movement.

2218
02:43:03,737 --> 02:43:07,518
[SPEAKER_14]: Had a violent bowel movement all over the DDR machine.

2219
02:43:08,498 --> 02:43:08,978
[SPEAKER_14]: Amazing.

2220
02:43:09,359 --> 02:43:09,939
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, Zero.

2221
02:43:10,579 --> 02:43:11,539
[SPEAKER_14]: Zero was so happy.

2222
02:43:11,599 --> 02:43:12,519
[SPEAKER_14]: What did he do to the machine?

2223
02:43:12,840 --> 02:43:15,900
[SPEAKER_11]: I was so happy that I basically shit all over the machine.

2224
02:43:16,220 --> 02:43:18,061
[SPEAKER_14]: He shit all over the machine.

2225
02:43:19,862 --> 02:43:21,222
[SPEAKER_14]: Figuratively shit.

2226
02:43:22,256 --> 02:43:23,537
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, and Loki.

2227
02:43:24,198 --> 02:43:33,645
[SPEAKER_14]: He was so happy that he... There's nothing that has to do with Suicide Babies in this one.

2228
02:43:34,025 --> 02:43:34,545
[SPEAKER_24]: Jeez.

2229
02:43:35,366 --> 02:43:36,387
[SPEAKER_24]: I know my timing.

2230
02:43:36,727 --> 02:43:37,167
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

2231
02:43:37,708 --> 02:43:38,088
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

2232
02:43:39,309 --> 02:43:42,391
[SPEAKER_24]: That he came all over the machine.

2233
02:43:42,431 --> 02:43:42,832
[SPEAKER_14]: There we go.

2234
02:43:44,353 --> 02:43:46,154
[SPEAKER_14]: He came all over the machine.

2235
02:43:46,955 --> 02:43:47,355
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2236
02:43:49,648 --> 02:43:50,048
[SPEAKER_14]: Anita.

2237
02:43:50,688 --> 02:43:51,309
[SPEAKER_14]: What did he do?

2238
02:43:51,829 --> 02:43:55,490
[SPEAKER_14]: He was so happy when he got an extra stage that he... Urinated!

2239
02:43:55,590 --> 02:43:58,331
[SPEAKER_14]: Urinated all over the DDR machine.

2240
02:43:58,431 --> 02:43:58,751
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2241
02:43:59,631 --> 02:44:01,692
[SPEAKER_14]: And last celebrity, Dark Child.

2242
02:44:01,772 --> 02:44:09,374
[SPEAKER_06]: He was so happy he... Busted a fat milky nut all over his man juice, coating the machine like a Krispy Kreme glazed donut.

2243
02:44:13,823 --> 02:44:14,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.

2244
02:44:14,543 --> 02:44:14,804
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait.

2245
02:44:14,884 --> 02:44:15,464
[SPEAKER_11]: Good answer.

2246
02:44:15,504 --> 02:44:16,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Good answer.

2247
02:44:16,164 --> 02:44:17,025
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to respond to that.

2248
02:44:17,585 --> 02:44:19,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Do not defame the Krispy Kremes.

2249
02:44:20,726 --> 02:44:22,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you say, like, Bel-Air Donuts or something?

2250
02:44:23,748 --> 02:44:25,849
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm hungry now and I want Krispy Kremes.

2251
02:44:27,010 --> 02:44:28,050
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want those Krispy Kremes.

2252
02:44:28,891 --> 02:44:30,031
[SPEAKER_04]: New flavor of the month.

2253
02:44:33,613 --> 02:44:34,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Krispy Kreme lemon.

2254
02:44:34,473 --> 02:44:35,754
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know how many they'll sell?

2255
02:44:36,474 --> 02:44:36,915
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's a hint.

2256
02:44:36,995 --> 02:44:37,595
[SPEAKER_14]: It's in his name.

2257
02:44:38,936 --> 02:44:39,496
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

2258
02:44:44,531 --> 02:44:48,713
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, moving on, next question.

2259
02:44:50,214 --> 02:44:56,636
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie was so excited to walk into game land to find that they had a radiant silver gun machine.

2260
02:44:57,357 --> 02:45:00,278
[SPEAKER_14]: The first thing she exclaimed was, blank.

2261
02:45:09,011 --> 02:45:11,333
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just gonna... There we go, hi!

2262

Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack I'm waiting on one more contestant

2263
02:45:38,430 --> 02:45:39,090
[SPEAKER_29]: Just change keys.

2264
02:45:39,611 --> 02:45:39,751
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

2265
02:45:40,031 --> 02:45:43,373
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie was so excited to walk into game land to find that they had a radiant silver gun machine.

2266
02:45:43,393 --> 02:45:46,115
[SPEAKER_14]: The first thing she exclaimed was blank.

2267
02:45:46,455 --> 02:45:47,636
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we have all the contestants in?

2268
02:45:49,517 --> 02:45:49,997
[SPEAKER_14]: Everyone in?

2269
02:45:50,017 --> 02:45:50,277
[SPEAKER_14]: Zero?

2270
02:45:51,058 --> 02:45:51,858
[SPEAKER_14]: I should go last.

2271
02:45:52,159 --> 02:45:52,699
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we go.

2272
02:45:52,819 --> 02:45:54,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, if you want to go last, we'll go last.

2273
02:45:54,760 --> 02:45:55,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

2274
02:46:01,545 --> 02:46:02,145
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, here we go.

2275
02:46:06,368 --> 02:46:06,468
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh...

2276
02:46:08,914 --> 02:46:10,975
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I know this waiting sucks, but you know what?

2277
02:46:11,696 --> 02:46:13,037
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the way the game worked, too.

2278
02:46:13,077 --> 02:46:14,838
[SPEAKER_14]: And they all, like, fiddled with each other.

2279
02:46:14,878 --> 02:46:16,119
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, here we go.

2280
02:46:18,841 --> 02:46:27,907
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie was so excited to walk into game land to find the Outer Radiance Overgun Machine, the first thing she exclaimed, Justin Circuit says, the first thing she exclaimed was, this game is mine!

2281
02:46:31,167 --> 02:46:35,109
[SPEAKER_14]: Dark Tetsuya said the first thing she exclaimed was, squee!

2282
02:46:36,630 --> 02:46:40,292
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, here we go, around the room, Jamie wants to go last, so we'll start with zero.

2283
02:46:40,432 --> 02:46:41,112
[SPEAKER_14]: What was the first thing?

2284
02:46:41,312 --> 02:46:42,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, we're gonna go this way, okay, we'll just go in backwards.

2285
02:46:42,953 --> 02:46:44,354
[SPEAKER_14]: Dark Child, first thing she said was, 37?

2286
02:46:44,894 --> 02:46:45,214
[SPEAKER_14]: In a row?

2287
02:46:50,205 --> 02:46:51,165
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, I got five.

2288
02:46:52,085 --> 02:46:52,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Save that for next week.

2289
02:46:52,785 --> 02:46:53,286
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Anita.

2290
02:46:54,006 --> 02:47:02,487
[SPEAKER_19]: First thing she exclaimed was... Beautiful.

2291
02:47:03,687 --> 02:47:04,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god.

2292
02:47:05,688 --> 02:47:08,008
[SPEAKER_06]: I just made my own Krispy Kreme glazed donut.

2293
02:47:08,668 --> 02:47:08,808
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2294
02:47:09,168 --> 02:47:11,129
[SPEAKER_06]: I just made my own Krispy Kreme glazed donut.

2295
02:47:11,909 --> 02:47:12,509
[SPEAKER_04]: New promo.

2296
02:47:13,469 --> 02:47:14,109
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.

2297
02:47:14,189 --> 02:47:14,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

2298
02:47:16,710 --> 02:47:18,250
[SPEAKER_24]: Orange Lunch Radio, it's orgasmic.

2299
02:47:18,812 --> 02:47:22,954
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, first thing she exclaimed was... This is a hard one.

2300
02:47:23,114 --> 02:47:24,295
[SPEAKER_24]: Squee, of course.

2301
02:47:24,715 --> 02:47:29,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Squee, so we have a point for Darkatsuya, hooray.

2302
02:47:31,218 --> 02:47:38,201
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, next up, Zero, first thing she exclaimed was... Why the fuck isn't anybody playing this game?

2303
02:47:40,542 --> 02:47:41,703
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually did think that.

2304
02:47:43,284 --> 02:47:45,965
[SPEAKER_04]: It was sitting there, beautiful.

2305
02:47:46,963 --> 02:47:49,084
[SPEAKER_04]: All alone and for one credit.

2306
02:47:50,225 --> 02:47:54,308
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I went, and I have to hold the microphone away so everyone holds your ears.

2307
02:47:54,848 --> 02:47:55,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2308
02:47:55,368 --> 02:47:57,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I went, squee!

2309
02:47:57,950 --> 02:47:58,330
Like that.

2310
02:47:58,869 --> 02:48:01,791
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, uh, I actually made a mistake.

2311
02:48:02,251 --> 02:48:06,413
[SPEAKER_14]: Justin Circuit's answer was actually, because I only saw the part that was in caps.

2312
02:48:07,034 --> 02:48:10,135
[SPEAKER_14]: He actually said, squee, this game is mine.

2313
02:48:10,315 --> 02:48:11,036
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the full answer.

2314
02:48:11,076 --> 02:48:12,296
[SPEAKER_14]: So he actually got a point too.

2315
02:48:12,536 --> 02:48:13,617
[SPEAKER_14]: And they both get two points.

2316
02:48:13,737 --> 02:48:13,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2317
02:48:14,177 --> 02:48:14,418
[SPEAKER_14]: So.

2318
02:48:15,498 --> 02:48:16,999
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did a very high pitched squee.

2319
02:48:19,477 --> 02:48:23,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so we are all tied up at 2-2.

2320
02:48:24,860 --> 02:48:26,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, that game is beautiful.

2321
02:48:27,161 --> 02:48:29,782
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ikaruga is going to be out on the GameCube soon.

2322
02:48:30,182 --> 02:48:33,164
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, two more questions, here we go.

2323
02:48:34,264 --> 02:48:38,486
[SPEAKER_14]: The nudist colony couldn't wait to get Para Para Paradise at their nude arcade.

2324
02:48:40,087 --> 02:48:42,228
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if you knew this, but the nudist colony has a nude arcade.

2325
02:48:43,354 --> 02:48:49,940
[SPEAKER_14]: But the arcade owner refused to get it because if I get that game, there will be too much blank.

2326
02:48:53,823 --> 02:48:57,286
[SPEAKER_14]: The nudist colony couldn't wait to get Para Para Paradise at their nude arcade.

2327
02:48:57,747 --> 02:49:02,371
[SPEAKER_14]: But the arcade owner refused to get it because if I get that game, there will be too much blank.

2328
02:49:11,275 --> 02:49:14,399
[SPEAKER_14]: We're playing Orange Lounge Match Game, Bomani Match Game.

02:49:25,931 --> 02:49:27,072
[SPEAKER_14]: Are all our celebrities locked in?

02:49:27,693 --> 02:49:28,634

[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

2336
02:49:38,194 --> 02:49:39,155
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I do need new socks.

2337
02:49:41,096 --> 02:49:41,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't look at my feet.

2338
02:49:46,440 --> 02:49:48,161
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not that I need new socks, I need to do laundry.

2339
02:49:52,204 --> 02:49:52,745
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving on.

2340
02:49:52,805 --> 02:49:53,685
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, is everybody in now?

2341
02:49:54,006 --> 02:49:54,186

[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, everybody's in.

2344
02:49:55,347 --> 02:49:55,707
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we go.

2345
02:49:56,367 --> 02:50:04,734
[SPEAKER_14]: Nudist Colony couldn't wait to get Para Para Paradise at their nude arcade, but the arcade owner refused to get it because if I get that game, there will be too much, Justice Circuit says, pole dancing.

2346
02:50:05,254 --> 02:50:06,455
[SPEAKER_14]: Too much pole dancing.

2347
02:50:08,536 --> 02:50:10,397
[SPEAKER_14]: Dark Tetsuya says there will be too much.

2348
02:50:10,818 --> 02:50:12,179
[SPEAKER_14]: Humping the coin slots.

2349
02:50:12,699 --> 02:50:13,900
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, Jamie, what did you say?

2350
02:50:14,260 --> 02:50:16,382
[SPEAKER_14]: Nudist Colony couldn't get it because there will be too much?

2351
02:50:16,782 --> 02:50:18,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Groin stank from sweaty balls.

2352
02:50:18,584 --> 02:50:20,645
[SPEAKER_14]: Groin stank from sweaty balls?

2353
02:50:22,326 --> 02:50:23,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god.

2354
02:50:25,709 --> 02:50:29,752
[SPEAKER_04]: I now have to save that to put into one of my future stories because I like that reference.

2355
02:50:31,794 --> 02:50:33,235
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just mentally thrown up.

2356
02:50:35,080 --> 02:50:35,320
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

2357
02:50:35,540 --> 02:50:36,801
[SPEAKER_10]: I've just mentally thrown up.

2358
02:50:36,961 --> 02:50:42,262
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, but the nudist colony couldn't get it because there will be too much... Old people body parts flopping around.

2359
02:50:42,862 --> 02:50:44,503
[SPEAKER_14]: Old people body parts flopping around.

2360
02:50:44,583 --> 02:50:45,763
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, I fear this answer.

2361
02:50:46,123 --> 02:50:58,387
[SPEAKER_24]: It says the nudist colony refused to get par par because there's going to be too much... Well, actually, you're going to have to rephrase it because there's going to be too much of a nice fish market smell in the air.

2362
02:51:01,208 --> 02:51:03,949
[SPEAKER_14]: So kind of the reverse of the stank balls answer.

2363
02:51:05,290 --> 02:51:06,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Pubic Stank.

2364
02:51:07,031 --> 02:51:07,712
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, God.

2365
02:51:08,572 --> 02:51:10,814
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a phrase I never wanted to hear on this show.

2366
02:51:12,475 --> 02:51:15,176
[SPEAKER_14]: It took 40 episodes to hear Pubic Stank on this show.

2367
02:51:15,236 --> 02:51:15,677
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2368
02:51:16,797 --> 02:51:17,518
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, God.

2369
02:51:17,998 --> 02:51:18,799
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we in kindergarten?

2370
02:51:19,059 --> 02:51:20,720
[SPEAKER_14]: We're making milestones every minute.

2371
02:51:21,600 --> 02:51:22,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

2372
02:51:23,041 --> 02:51:25,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what my original answer was?

2373
02:51:25,923 --> 02:51:28,365
[SPEAKER_04]: My original answer was Flying Snake Grenade.

2374
02:51:28,385 --> 02:51:30,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Pub Stank.

2375
02:51:32,246 --> 02:51:39,288
[SPEAKER_14]: Anita, the nudist colony refused to get Parapara because there would be too much... I don't understand why this is so funny.

2376
02:51:39,648 --> 02:51:42,489
[SPEAKER_05]: There would just be too much testicular dryness.

2377
02:51:42,529 --> 02:51:45,090
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is a very serious subject we're talking about here.

2378
02:51:45,570 --> 02:51:50,951
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, do you understand the incidence of testicular dryness in this country?

2379
02:51:51,051 --> 02:51:54,272
[SPEAKER_05]: You just don't even know how serious a problem it is.

2380
02:51:56,213 --> 02:51:59,654
[SPEAKER_14]: Anita, I think Anita just wants to volunteer to go over there and lick everyone's balls.

2381
02:52:01,334 --> 02:52:02,514
[SPEAKER_14]: I have testicular dryness.

2382
02:52:04,555 --> 02:52:04,735
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2383
02:52:05,736 --> 02:52:08,356
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want him to come faster, you need to lick his balls.

2384
02:52:12,598 --> 02:52:13,058
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

2385
02:52:13,818 --> 02:52:14,198
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

2386
02:52:14,278 --> 02:52:15,379
[SPEAKER_14]: All I can say is wow.

2387
02:52:16,819 --> 02:52:19,140
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see if we get a match on this last one with Dark Child.

2388
02:52:19,160 --> 02:52:20,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I get the sound from Jamie, though?

2389
02:52:20,701 --> 02:52:22,161
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we can.

2390
02:52:22,941 --> 02:52:23,341
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2391
02:52:23,642 --> 02:52:27,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, there will be too much bootleg porn on the internet.

2392
02:52:27,663 --> 02:52:29,283
[SPEAKER_14]: Bootleg porn on the internet.

2393
02:52:29,323 --> 02:52:30,684
[SPEAKER_14]: Good answer, but not a match.

2394
02:52:31,852 --> 02:52:32,172
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2395
02:52:33,634 --> 02:52:34,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we go.

2396
02:52:34,515 --> 02:52:35,235
[SPEAKER_14]: Last question.

2397
02:52:35,275 --> 02:52:35,876
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know what?

2398
02:52:37,457 --> 02:52:40,960
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a good sense of humor.

2399
02:52:41,321 --> 02:52:43,643
[SPEAKER_14]: I can be self-deprecating because this question is about me.

2400
02:52:46,085 --> 02:52:48,647
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob was surprised that no one at the gay bar knew.

2401
02:52:48,807 --> 02:52:50,969
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't know why I was at a gay bar.

2402
02:52:50,989 --> 02:52:51,830
[SPEAKER_14]: I just was, okay?

2403
02:52:51,850 --> 02:52:54,352
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's just assume, you know, hey, Rob went to a gay bar.

2404
02:52:56,414 --> 02:52:57,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Robby's still in my Animal Crossing village.

2405
02:52:59,849 --> 02:53:03,691
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob was surprised that no one at the local gay bar knew what DDR was.

2406
02:53:04,611 --> 02:53:07,813
[SPEAKER_14]: He thought the best way to explain it to them was to blank.

2407
02:53:13,896 --> 02:53:17,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob was surprised that no one at the local gay bar knew what DDR was.

2408
02:53:17,898 --> 02:53:20,619
[SPEAKER_14]: He thought the best way to explain it to them was to blank.

2409
02:53:21,700 --> 02:53:22,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Say whatever you want.

2410
02:53:22,460 --> 02:53:22,821
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't care.

2411
02:53:22,841 --> 02:53:23,341
[SPEAKER_14]: I've heard it all.

2412
02:53:30,143 --> 02:53:34,926
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob was surprised that no one at the local gay bar knew what DDR was, because DDR is such a gay game.

2413
02:53:35,586 --> 02:53:38,488
[SPEAKER_14]: He thought that the best way to explain it to them was to blink.

2414
02:53:42,371 --> 02:53:44,172
[SPEAKER_14]: One contestant's locked in, I think.

2415
02:53:44,752 --> 02:53:46,073
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me just verify this answer.

2416
02:53:48,815 --> 02:53:50,576
[SPEAKER_14]: Ah, brilliant answer.

2417
02:53:51,196 --> 02:53:52,537
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm waiting on one more contestant.

2418
02:54:02,194 --> 02:54:02,734
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2419
02:54:06,935 --> 02:54:08,896
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, we have both contestants locked in.

2420
02:54:08,936 --> 02:54:10,336
[SPEAKER_14]: Are all our celebrities locked in?

2421
02:54:10,376 --> 02:54:11,496
[SPEAKER_14]: Our fabulous, wonderful celebrities?

2422
02:54:11,916 --> 02:54:13,597
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all tied up, so it's got to come down to this.

2423
02:54:14,697 --> 02:54:16,998
[SPEAKER_14]: Or we're going to have a tie, and there's not enough time for a tiebreaker.

2424
02:54:18,058 --> 02:54:18,939
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, everybody's in.

2425
02:54:19,499 --> 02:54:19,999
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, here we go.

2426
02:54:21,903 --> 02:54:26,004
[SPEAKER_14]: Justin Circuit says, Rob was surprised that no one at the local gay bar knew what DDR was.

2427
02:54:26,044 --> 02:54:30,606
[SPEAKER_14]: He thought the best way to explain it to them was to undress slowly while on the DDR machine.

2428
02:54:32,867 --> 02:54:33,207
[SPEAKER_14]: Blink.

2429
02:54:34,087 --> 02:54:38,449
[SPEAKER_14]: Except there's no DDR machine at the gay bar, or else I just, wouldn't I just point and say that's DDR?

2430
02:54:45,586 --> 02:54:46,066
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever.

2431
02:54:46,366 --> 02:54:54,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, DarkTetsuya says, The best way to explain it to them was to grab the nearest chair and start stomping his feet wildly like he's playing Legend of Max.

2432
02:54:54,688 --> 02:54:55,148
[SPEAKER_14]: There we go.

2433
02:54:55,248 --> 02:54:55,708
[SPEAKER_14]: Good answer.

2434
02:54:56,208 --> 02:54:58,728
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's see if it's either one of those two matches.

2435
02:54:58,828 --> 02:55:03,389
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie, Rob's best way to explain this at the gay bar was to... Propel.

2436
02:55:04,389 --> 02:55:07,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god.

2437
02:55:08,393 --> 02:55:10,775
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a total, like, EOSFVB answer.

2438
02:55:10,835 --> 02:55:13,257
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, it was zero.

2439
02:55:13,317 --> 02:55:17,920
[SPEAKER_11]: The best way to explain it to them was to... Tell them DDR stood for Dick Dick Revolution.

2440
02:55:18,661 --> 02:55:21,243
[SPEAKER_14]: Tell them DDR stood for Dick Dick Revolution.

2441
02:55:23,265 --> 02:55:25,366
[SPEAKER_14]: And with some of the players, that's very true.

2442
02:55:25,406 --> 02:55:27,868
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, if you go to this one arcade, it's called... Never mind.

2443
02:55:29,409 --> 02:55:30,971
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a match game question for next week.

2444
02:55:33,192 --> 02:55:36,435
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, Rob thought the best way to explain it to them was to...

2445
02:55:37,541 --> 02:55:41,242
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, was to point out anybody that's doing white boy freestyle.

2446
02:55:42,823 --> 02:55:45,023
[SPEAKER_14]: Point out anybody that's doing white boy freestyle.

2447
02:55:45,303 --> 02:55:45,684
[SPEAKER_14]: Beautiful.

2448
02:55:46,204 --> 02:55:50,045
[SPEAKER_14]: Anita, the best way to explain what DDR was, was to?

2449
02:55:50,845 --> 02:55:57,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I thought the best way was to strip butt naked and country line dance in front of the karaoke machine while playing It's Raining Men.

2450
02:55:59,888 --> 02:56:01,048
[SPEAKER_14]: I did that two weeks ago.

2451
02:56:05,496 --> 02:56:07,217
[SPEAKER_14]: At least that involved nudity, which is exciting.

2452
02:56:07,738 --> 02:56:19,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Child, the best way, I can't wait to hear this, the best way to explain DDR was to shimmy, sashay, pirouette, left cheek, right cheek, blow a kiss, pose.

2453
02:56:19,587 --> 02:56:20,427
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fabulous.

2454
02:56:26,092 --> 02:56:27,373
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh my god!

2455
02:56:33,163 --> 02:56:35,646
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody wants to know how Dark Child knows this.

2456
02:56:37,569 --> 02:56:38,610
[SPEAKER_14]: Where was that from, Dark Child?

2457
02:56:38,630 --> 02:56:41,434
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know where it's from, I just came up with it.

2458
02:56:41,734 --> 02:56:42,756
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, even worse!

2459
02:56:43,236 --> 02:56:46,881
[SPEAKER_14]: It kind of reminds me, I think it's the scene in Drop Dead Gorgeous, but anyway, doesn't matter.

2460
02:56:47,281 --> 02:56:47,542
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway...

2461
02:56:49,842 --> 02:56:52,064
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just thinking more about Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.

2462
02:56:52,384 --> 02:56:53,185
[SPEAKER_14]: Ah, there we go, yes.

2463
02:56:53,625 --> 02:56:56,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so it ended in a tie tonight.

2464
02:56:56,588 --> 02:56:59,130
[SPEAKER_14]: Two points for Dark Tetsuya and two points for Justin.

2465
02:56:59,230 --> 02:57:01,652
[SPEAKER_14]: So that means we have no winner.

2466
02:57:02,172 --> 02:57:03,793
[SPEAKER_14]: And do we like it when there's no winner?

2467
02:57:04,194 --> 02:57:04,574
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

2468
02:57:04,694 --> 02:57:05,615
[SPEAKER_14]: Boo.

2469
02:57:05,715 --> 02:57:06,455
[SPEAKER_14]: You suck.

2470
02:57:06,656 --> 02:57:07,536
[SPEAKER_14]: Get better next time.

2471
02:57:08,297 --> 02:57:10,439
[SPEAKER_14]: A big fuck you to all the players who lost.

2472
02:57:12,098 --> 02:57:15,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it when no one wins because then we don't have to think of prizes to not give them.

2473
02:57:15,261 --> 02:57:17,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what are some consolation prizes we should give these two for tying?

2474
02:57:18,062 --> 02:57:19,984
[SPEAKER_04]: A box of rice-a-roni, the San Francisco treat.

2475
02:57:20,184 --> 02:57:20,584
[SPEAKER_14]: Ding, ding.

2476
02:57:23,026 --> 02:57:25,467
[SPEAKER_06]: How about their own personal home version of Deep Thick Revolution?

2477
02:57:26,668 --> 02:57:30,691
[SPEAKER_14]: You two will personally get me explaining DDR to you in Anita Fashions.

2478
02:57:32,512 --> 02:57:34,894
[SPEAKER_11]: How about you make them get the next PC version of DDR?

2479
02:57:42,014 --> 02:57:44,595
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes me a sad panda.

2480
02:57:47,116 --> 02:57:54,778
[SPEAKER_29]: They get a hand and a can of Crisco.

2481
02:57:56,778 --> 02:58:01,120
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's time for the jingle.

2482
02:58:02,580 --> 02:58:02,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Ready?

2483
02:58:03,320 --> 02:58:06,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Rice-a-roni, the San Francisco treat.

2484
02:58:06,661 --> 02:58:08,702
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.

2485
02:58:14,955 --> 02:58:20,418
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, I have to give a public thank you over the air to Sharks Girl for my filler bunny.

2486
02:58:22,360 --> 02:58:27,363
[SPEAKER_04]: I love my... Is the pink one that big in the test tube?

2487
02:58:28,103 --> 02:58:30,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Melody got me my filler bunny for my birthday.

2488
02:58:35,123 --> 02:58:37,104
[SPEAKER_14]: I've just detected a fault in the AE-35 unit.

2489
02:59:05,936 --> 02:59:06,936
[SPEAKER_14]: Ice Queen, final thought?

2490
02:59:08,677 --> 02:59:09,597
[SPEAKER_34]: I need sex.

2491
02:59:11,777 --> 02:59:12,897
[SPEAKER_14]: Dark Child, final thought?

2492
02:59:13,418 --> 02:59:15,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Child is about to die.

2493
02:59:16,998 --> 02:59:24,780
[SPEAKER_14]: And my final thought is also, my final thought is also, I need sex, but not with ice cream.

2494
02:59:35,039 --> 02:59:36,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, okay.

2495
02:59:36,181 --> 02:59:38,363
[SPEAKER_14]: The final, final word of the night.

2496
02:59:38,383 --> 02:59:39,344
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie got it last week.

2497
02:59:39,444 --> 02:59:40,104
[SPEAKER_14]: Final word of the night.

2498
02:59:40,164 --> 02:59:42,587
[SPEAKER_14]: Anita, what is tonight's final word of the night?

2499
02:59:44,108 --> 02:59:45,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Ka-dunk, ka-dunk, yeah!

2500
02:59:46,894 --> 02:59:47,454
[SPEAKER_32]: DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS

2501
03:00:13,496 --> 03:00:31,303
[SPEAKER_00]: Satan's Game Your children, like it or not, are attracted in their weaker years to the occult, and a game like D&D fuels their imagination and makes them feel special while drawing them deeper and deeper into the bowels of El Diablo.

2502
03:00:31,983 --> 03:00:38,387
[SPEAKER_00]: This afternoon, the Dead Ale Wives Watchtower invites you to sit in on an actual gaming session.

2503
03:00:39,028 --> 03:00:47,994
[SPEAKER_00]: Observe the previously unobservable as a hidden camera takes you to the inner sanctum of Dungeons and Dragons.

2504
03:00:50,335 --> 03:00:53,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Galstaff, you have entered the door to the north.

2505
03:00:53,998 --> 03:00:57,160
[SPEAKER_09]: You are now by yourself, standing in a dark room.

2506
03:00:57,700 --> 03:01:01,583
[SPEAKER_09]: The pungent stench of mildew emanates from the wet dungeon walls.

2507
03:01:03,336 --> 03:01:04,337
[SPEAKER_09]: They're right next to you.

2508
03:01:04,657 --> 03:01:05,799
[SPEAKER_09]: I cast a spell.

2509
03:01:05,939 --> 03:01:07,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's the Mountain Dew?

2510
03:01:07,380 --> 03:01:08,822
[SPEAKER_09]: In the fridge, duh.

2511
03:01:09,002 --> 03:01:10,323
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to cast a spell.

2512
03:01:12,003 --> 03:01:13,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you can have them out and do.

2513
03:01:13,685 --> 03:01:14,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Just go get it.

2514
03:01:14,685 --> 03:01:16,087
[SPEAKER_09]: I can cast any of these, right?

2515
03:01:16,247 --> 03:01:16,747
[SPEAKER_09]: On the list?

2516
03:01:16,807 --> 03:01:18,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, any of the first level ones.

2517
03:01:18,789 --> 03:01:19,850
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna get a soda.

2518
03:01:19,970 --> 03:01:21,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone want one?

2519
03:01:21,551 --> 03:01:23,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Cram, I'm not in the room, right?

2520
03:01:23,993 --> 03:01:24,794
[SPEAKER_09]: What room?

2521
03:01:25,255 --> 03:01:27,617
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanna cast Magic Missile.

2522
03:01:27,637 --> 03:01:30,559
[SPEAKER_07]: The room where he's casting all these spells from.

2523
03:01:30,619 --> 03:01:32,481
[SPEAKER_09]: He hasn't cast anything yet.

2524
03:01:32,861 --> 03:01:34,222
[SPEAKER_09]: I am, though, if you'd listen.

2525
03:01:34,362 --> 03:01:36,264
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm casting Magic Missile.

2526
03:01:36,404 --> 03:01:37,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are you casting Magic Missile?

2527
03:01:37,966 --> 03:01:39,307
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing to attack here.

2528
03:01:40,973 --> 03:01:42,434
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm attacking the darkness!

2529
03:01:45,755 --> 03:01:46,676
[SPEAKER_09]: Fine, fine.

2530
03:01:46,956 --> 03:01:48,176
[SPEAKER_09]: You attack the darkness.

2531
03:01:48,496 --> 03:01:49,837
[SPEAKER_09]: There's an elf in front of you.

2532
03:01:49,877 --> 03:01:50,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Whoa!

2533
03:01:50,637 --> 03:01:51,338
[SPEAKER_09]: That's me, right?

2534
03:01:51,658 --> 03:01:57,060
[SPEAKER_09]: He's wearing a brown tunic, and he has gray hair and blue eyes.

2535
03:01:57,180 --> 03:01:57,841
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't.

2536
03:01:57,901 --> 03:01:58,761
[SPEAKER_09]: I have gray eyes.

2537
03:01:59,421 --> 03:02:00,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me see that sheet.

2538
03:02:00,362 --> 03:02:04,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it says I have blue, but I decided I wanted gray eyes.

2539
03:02:04,324 --> 03:02:04,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

2540
03:02:04,924 --> 03:02:07,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, you guys can talk to each other now if you want.

2541
03:02:08,851 --> 03:02:09,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

2542
03:02:09,771 --> 03:02:10,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

2543
03:02:10,832 --> 03:02:13,353
[SPEAKER_08]: I am Galstaff, Sorcerer of Light.

2544
03:02:13,714 --> 03:02:16,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Then how come you had to cast magic missiles?

2545
03:02:18,956 --> 03:02:20,617
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are being attacked.

2546
03:02:20,677 --> 03:02:22,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I see that happening?

2547
03:02:22,678 --> 03:02:25,019
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you're outside by the tavern.

2548
03:02:25,099 --> 03:02:26,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool, I get drunk.

2549
03:02:27,781 --> 03:02:29,762
[SPEAKER_09]: There are seven ogres surrounding you.

2550
03:02:29,902 --> 03:02:30,903
[SPEAKER_08]: How could they surround us?

2551
03:02:31,043 --> 03:02:33,264
[SPEAKER_08]: I had Mordenkainen's magical watchdog cast.

2552
03:02:33,324 --> 03:02:34,024
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you didn't.

2553
03:02:34,144 --> 03:02:35,125
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting drunk!

2554
03:02:35,245 --> 03:02:36,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any girls there?

2555
03:02:36,625 --> 03:02:37,546
[SPEAKER_08]: I totally did!

2556
03:02:37,566 --> 03:02:41,007
[SPEAKER_08]: You asked me if I wanted any equipment before this adventure, and I said no.

2557
03:02:41,327 --> 03:02:46,390
[SPEAKER_08]: But I need material components for all my spells, so I cast Mordenkainen's faithful watchdog.

2558
03:02:46,430 --> 03:02:48,031
[SPEAKER_09]: But you never actually cast it.

2559
03:02:48,151 --> 03:02:50,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll the dice to see if I'm getting drunk!

2560
03:02:50,692 --> 03:02:50,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Ugh.

2561
03:02:51,488 --> 03:02:52,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you are.

2562
03:02:52,668 --> 03:02:54,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any girls there?

2563
03:02:54,169 --> 03:02:54,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2564
03:02:54,769 --> 03:02:55,550
[SPEAKER_09]: I did, though.

2565
03:02:55,670 --> 03:02:57,670
[SPEAKER_09]: I completely fed when you asked me.

2566
03:02:57,770 --> 03:02:58,551
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you didn't.

2567
03:02:58,851 --> 03:03:01,572
[SPEAKER_09]: You didn't actually say that you were casting the spell.

2568
03:03:01,632 --> 03:03:03,113
[SPEAKER_09]: So now there's ogres, okay?

2569
03:03:03,133 --> 03:03:03,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Ogres?

2570
03:03:04,193 --> 03:03:06,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, I got an ogre-slaying knife.

2571
03:03:06,154 --> 03:03:08,355
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got a plus nine against ogres.

2572
03:03:08,375 --> 03:03:09,355
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not there.

2573
03:03:09,395 --> 03:03:10,455
[SPEAKER_09]: You're getting drunk.

2574
03:03:10,595 --> 03:03:14,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, but if there's any girls there, I want to do them.

2575
03:03:14,697 --> 03:03:43,273
[SPEAKER_00]: there you have it a frightening look into America's most frightening pastime remember that it's not your children's fault that they're being drawn into a satanic world of nightmare it's their gym teacher's fault for making them feel outcast when they couldn't do one single pull up thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week
