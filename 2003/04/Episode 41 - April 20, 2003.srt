1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Message for you, son!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Do you want to hear the most annoying fan in the world?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Togg and Ben sub.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Orange Lounge may contain adult content. Orange Lounge may contain many four letter words.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,500
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,500
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,500
In this episode...

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,000
Hey, are there any balls down there?

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,500
That's the biggest berry you've ever seen, Dingleberry.

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,500
What's your favorite scary movie?

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,500
Showgirls. Absolutely frightening.

13
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,500
What's yours?

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,000
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Now's the time on Sprockets and me dogs!

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too!

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I know kung fu.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Why did they have to take the word gay?

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
No! What I expect from a funny situation is Hindu.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hey!

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Dark sapphire.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Shut up! Where's my gun? This is my boom stick.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Skye. Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb. Loki. I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What kind of what human being would find that funny? Orange Lounge Radio.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We are live and this is episode number 41 for April the 20th of 2003.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You're tuned into the Bimani scene's most egg-citing radio station of all things, Biiiiimani!

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That was bad.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I came up with that joke all by myself.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Hand.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Ow.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Did everyone hear that? Here, I'll do it louder.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Ow! Mommy.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner of the happy and most dominating bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I have Battle Royale manga. Everybody must die.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You know her better as Dark Sakura, the battle roy, Alhorn.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki!

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Hey everyone.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Guess what, kids? It's just us tonight.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yay!

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Feelers of love, going back to our roots.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yay!

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Actually, that's not totally true.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Intern Zero is going to be by a little later, hopefully.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And some other pals, too. I don't know who's all coming.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But for the start of the show, it's just us.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yay!

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So, we'll be talking to everybody when they get here more a little bit later. We've got a little bit of the money.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Dude, we talked about that last week.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We have some things.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That guy rocks, man. He rocks even more in frickin' manga.

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We're gonna start off with some 2DX music. We'll be back. Enjoy.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Sometimes I am singing meaningful lines Sometimes I have to go to work, I have to leave

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh, I feel the pressure on my mind

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So I knew it might be right

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But I can't wait for my memories

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
For this life

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I go, I need it

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I want to be around

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I keep it, I touch it

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I give you all my life

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
My life, my glory

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I give you all my life

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
All I want is to be free till the end

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You're my baby, you're my making love with you

67
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I will stay

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
with you, with you

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I love you and love

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
with me too, with me too

71
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
One day, one day, two days, one day

72
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
With the sun a cold moon in the dark

73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'll fly, fly, yeah, I'll stay

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Every day, I'll fly, yeah, I'll stay

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Fade to black

76
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Love you

77
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yeah, me too

78
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah, me too

79
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Oh, you and me

80
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Well, I do

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
.

82
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
.

83
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
.

84
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
.

85
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
.

86
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
.

87
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
.

88
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
.

89
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
.

90
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
.

91
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Oh

92
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,800
Bing pong balls!

93
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,320
I think that's my favorite sound effect that Jamie ever did.

94
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,120
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio episode number forty one, April the

95
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,580
twentieth of two thousand three.

96
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,680
Happy Easter to all you kids out there listening and if you aren't down with

97
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,200
Easter, then happy Sunday to you.

98
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,640
I totally forgot that was Easter, that's why the arcade was empty. You didn't do anything today?

99
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,560
No. I didn't really...

100
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,180
I went over to my parents' house and had a little ham, and that was it.

101
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,180
We had a ham a week ago.

102
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,620
So I just ate food.

103
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,500
Just ate food.

104
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,260
A late happy birthday wish to Jamie.

105
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,820
She was one year older as of yesterday.

106
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,940
Happy birthday wishes to you, because your

107
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,660
birthday was yesterday.

108
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,620
And how did you celebrate?

109
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,860
I killed people.

110
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,620
Went to the auction, and I got legendary acts for the

111
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,860
TurboGrafx.

112
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,860
Cool. I didn't know they made that for TurboGrafx.

113
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,860
Yep.

114
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,860
Neat.

115
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,860
And I got, um, uh, what was it?

116
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,860
Some game for the Atari adapter for the Colecovision.

117
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,860
I don't remember what it was.

118
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,860
Centipede.

119
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,860
Oh, cool.

120
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,860
Turns out I already had it.

121
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,860
This lovely bit of, um, literature that you gave me.

122
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,860
Ah, yes, my present, which are always the best.

123
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,860
Which I'm busy trying to remember.

124
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,860
It sucks because I'm so out of practice on my hiragana that I'm having problems reading some of these names.

125
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,860
I haven't gotten you anything yet because I had to buy my mom something her birthday is tomorrow.

126
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,860
That's fine.

127
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,860
No priorities and all.

128
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,860
And you gave me a gift certificate round.

129
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,860
Mm-hmm.

130
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,860
So I can go buy my Battle Royale novel in stock.

131
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,860
So you can indulge more in that Battle Royale-ness.

132
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,860
That big inside joke that just won't die.

133
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,860
It's beyond an inside joke at this point.

134
00:12:54,860 --> 00:13:00,040
It's a lifestyle for some really cool card from Brad and Irene that has it's like one of my favorite

135
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:07,100
One of my favorite far-side ones is the many expressions of the Irish Center which are all the same

136
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,420
I've got money from grandma

137
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,300
which I put in the bank to pay bills because I'm currently not working and

138
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,300
I got lunch

139
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:25,140
Jessica and she bought me a clip-on desk lamp so that I can like not go blind when I draw very cool

140
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,860
You can maybe double and use it with your gameboy too if you wanted

141
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:39,360
Burner I got lots of ice cream. Oh ice creams always good. Did you have cake and ice cream?

142
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,360
No, no, cake. I'd brownie in my ice cream.

143
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,360
Well, that's close enough to cake. Cake pie!

144
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,360
Cake pie!

145
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,360
I want, I want ice cream.

146
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,360
Julie got me a boba.

147
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,360
We can go get, let's get ice cream after tonight's show.

148
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:52,360
Okay.

149
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,360
I want ice cream too.

150
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,360
Are you gonna get me ice cream?

151
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,360
I guess I can.

152
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,360
Woohoo! Cause I'm broke.

153
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,360
Spoiler enough. That's alright.

154
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,360
I gotta get more ice cream.

155
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,360
I'm only looking for cake pie ice cream though.

156
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,360
We should take, we should get some cake batter ice cream and some like pumpkin pie ice cream and mix them together.

157
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
and mix them together. Voila! Cake pie ice cream!

158
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,360
They don't have pumpkin pie ice cream.

159
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,360
They don't have pumpkin pie ice cream?

160
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,360
You know what my favorite is now? Is getting the cake batter ice cream.

161
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,360
They have pumpkin ice cream, it's good enough, it's just like, you know the frickin jelly bellies,

162
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,360
you know, you mix them together and you create some.

163
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:30,360
You get some peanut butter flavored ice cream with some like strawberry flavored ice cream. Bam!

164
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,360
Rob, you need to try the one I made for you.

165
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,360
I made Dan. Dan said surprise him.

166
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,360
Um, that's dangerous with me and Coldstone.

167
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:36,860
Yes.

168
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,860
I took cake batter ice cream, peanut butter cups, and caramel-

169
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,860
Oh, I'm so fuckin' hungry!

170
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,360
My favorite now is the cake batter ice cream with brownie and coconut.

171
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,860
Mmm.

172
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,360
I used to get cheesecake with graham cracker and cherries.

173
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,860
This is like Iron Chef where the secret ingredient is Coldstone.

174
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,860
Um, by the way-

175
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,860
Yes?

176
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,860
Um, do you wanna see a really painful way to die?

177
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,860
Okay, cuz this'll be great radio.

178
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,860
Isn't this a great picture of...

179
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,860
That's... Oh my god, he looks like Nine in that pic- or are you talking about the other one?

180
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,860
Oh, hello.

181
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,860
Okay, I'm gonna scan this.

182
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,860
He's sexy.

183
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,860
And send pictures of this to everybody here, because this is like the best manga ever.

184
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:26,860
It shows this guy here, I forgot which one he is, has this picture of him, of Mimura hugging the younger one to comfort him.

185
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,860
And then these bullets going through his face.

186
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,860
Aww.

187
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,860
And, like, it has the bullet time trail, like, in, um, what was that game?

188
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,860
On PC.

189
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,860
Uh, Dead to Rights?

190
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,860
No, no, no.

191
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,860
Where he'd go into bullet time and they'd dodge all the bullets, and...

192
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,860
Dead to Rights?

193
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,860
Max Payne.

194
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,860
Max Payne?

195
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,860
Max Payne.

196
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,860
Uh...

197
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,860
You know what I have to say about that?

198
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,860
He looks like Big Boy.

199
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,860
That's the Frodo!

200
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,860
That's who it looks like.

201
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,860
Frodo!

202
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,860
Oh my gosh!

203
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,860
That's the Frodo.

204
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,860
He does look like Frodo.

205
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:59,860
And look, when he falls on the ground, his head busts open and there's brains all over the place.

206
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,860
Ew!

207
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:07,860
And he got shot across his belly and his intestines start coming out, so he freakin' duct tapes them back in.

208
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,860
Aww, nasty. Are they ever going to make a battle royale video game? Why don't they?

209
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,860
They should.

210
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,860
Why don't they?

211
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,860
Because we suck.

212
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,860
They won't make a video game because we suck.

213
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,860
Damn right, because the stupid Americans get offended by everything.

214
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:27,360
Oh my god, it's red! Which is sinuous blood! Which is bad!

215
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,860
As he's bleeding to death, he wires a bomb.

216
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,860
This is so cool.

217
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,860
I don't know if I'm gonna regret buying that for Jamie. She might come up with too many ideas.

218
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,860
And then he tries to pull up Kiriyama. And Kiriyama, by the way, looks like the Uber-Bishonen.

219
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,360
Instead of either looking like the Japanese guy who's not.

220
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,920
If you hear of any large explosions in the Sacramento area, I've never met Jamie.

221
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:57,840
Never knew her.

222
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,520
So orders of business tonight.

223
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,880
As you may or may not know, tonight, ladies and gentlemen, is the last episode of Orange

224
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,740
Lounge Radio.

225
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,080
In this studio.

226
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,720
Just had to get him going for a minute, yes.

227
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,080
It's the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio in this studio, in this lovely little house

228
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:23,800
that I'm in right now, in Orange Lounge World Headquarters in Citrus Heights, to be specific.

229
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,960
It's the last one here because we're going to have Battle Royale here tomorrow.

230
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,800
We'll invite a bunch of people that I don't like and then I'll kill them.

231
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,800
They'll all die.

232
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,480
So, we had the chat room going for a minute, they're all, no!

233
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,480
I love lag.

234
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,480
Anyway, actually...

235
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
I fooled you!

236
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:51,720
Actually, what's happening next Saturday is the big move, and what's happening is I'm

237
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,080
moving out of the house I'm in right now, and I've got to give a big thank you on the

238
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,040
show, even though he's not listening right now to Brian, my current roommate, but he's

239
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:08,400
put up with a lot of crap on this show through the past 40 some odd episodes that we've done

240
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,000
here, and he basically lets me take over the house on Sunday nights, and so we appreciate

241
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
that.

242
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,600
Next week's show, however, since there's going to be so much going on between the move and

243
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,600
Jamie and I have another commitment we've got to take care of on Sunday night, next

244
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
week's show's going to be pre-taped.

245
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,600
Maybe.

246
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
Maybe?

247
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Maybe.

248
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,600
What's your idea?

249
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:32,360
I'll have my computer set up, that's like priority number one, I can't live without

250
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,360
my computer.

251
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,360
So we might not have the internet in time, that's the only problem.

252
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,360
You don't have the computer set up, but there might not be an internet.

253
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,360
Why?

254
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,360
We had to call this week and get it set up.

255
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,360
I know, I know.

256
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,360
They might not come out till Monday or Tuesday, or if they're not open on the weekend.

257
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,360
I have dial-up.

258
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,360
I still have my internet.

259
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,360
We'll figure something out.

260
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,360
We'll figure something out.

261
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,360
But bare minimum, there'll be a tape show next week.

262
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,360
There'll be some kind of show, news show this Sunday.

263
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,360
And then after that...

264
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,360
Did you say a nude show?

265
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,360
A nude show, that would be interesting.

266
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,360
We'll get you a stripper.

267
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,360
My birthday's coming up.

268
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,360
We'll get you a stripper.

269
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,360
This is a big'un, because I'm 25 this year.

270
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,360
I can't believe I just gave my age over here, god.

271
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,360
Now I'm like, I've just placed myself in that over-20 DDR player.

272
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,360
I was very happy because the guy at Coldstone...

273
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,360
First of all, Julie made them sing to me.

274
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,360
I wanted to die.

275
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,360
Secondly, the guy behind the counter...

276
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:32,360
In all seriousness, because I look, to be sure, asked me if I was turning 18.

277
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,360
Did you get carded to an R-rated movie?

278
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,360
Hey, that's not funny.

279
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,360
That's not funny at all!

280
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,360
Stupid freaking dead man at Campus Chico Theater, you suck!

281
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,360
At least he didn't ask for a...

282
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,360
Hi, can I speak to your mommy?

283
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,360
No, you can't fucking talk to my mommy, motherfucker!

284
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,360
Why would the Cold Stone guy want to talk to your mommy?

285
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,360
No!

286
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,360
See, I don't mind when I'm looking face to face with someone and then...

287
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,360
Hey little girl, I bet your mommy's pretty hot!

288
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,360
What the hell? Why would he want to see your mommy?

289
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,360
No, I'm talking to everyone in telemarketing.

290
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,360
I know, I know.

291
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,360
Wait, wait.

292
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,360
I bet I told him to die, go to hell, and opt me off his mailing list.

293
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,360
That'd be like, you know, some guy going,

294
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,360
Hey, I bet your mom's pretty hot.

295
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,360
Well, she's dead. Oh, good, then she can't say no.

296
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,360
Oh, that's fucked up.

297
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,360
Low-key sound politically correct.

298
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,360
Statement of the night, thank you.

299
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,360
I screw political correctness.

300
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,360
It's an excuse. It's a crutch.

301
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:34,360
Back to the story of the moving in Orange Launch Radio. So in two weeks, we'll be coming to you from our brand new studio.

302
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,360
We'll be free-loading.

303
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,360
Our brand new studio. If there's a problem, though, maybe we can...

304
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,360
You can pay for my gas.

305
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:47,360
If there happens to be a problem, maybe we can convince Jamie to do a studio Jamie for a night, which would be fine.

306
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,360
Why? I'm going to be there, too.

307
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:56,360
I know, but if something happens and our Internet's not up by then, we might have to do that show right...at your house.

308
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,360
Oh, broadcast?

309
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,360
If something happens, yes.

310
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,360
Well, I guess no Xbox Live for Dan that night.

311
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,360
Well, we'll figure something out.

312
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,360
I'm pretty sure the internet will be up for us by then.

313
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,360
Oh darn, I was gonna leave it on PSO.

314
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,360
Bogged in, sitting there.

315
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,360
It's really funny to go on PSO and just stand there and have people talk to you.

316
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,360
Have you done that? Do you watch people talk to you?

317
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,360
People come up, what level? Dot, dot, dot.

318
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,360
Okay, dot, dot, dot.

319
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,840
You know what people do on PSO that I find hilarious?

320
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,520
Like, I went on PSO one night, and this guy was just running in a circle.

321
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,720
He just ran in a circle around the lobby.

322
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,720
He just kept running in a circle.

323
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,200
And then, like, people would try to talk to him, and he just kept running.

324
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,800
Like, he did that. I swear to God, I was sitting there for ten minutes and watched this guy just keep running in a circle.

325
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,320
And then, finally, some guy started running behind him.

326
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:51,960
And pretty soon, I got in on it, too, and then, like, six of us were all running in a giant circle.

327
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:57,960
It was like a big fucking PSO conga line. It was like the nerdiest thing I'd ever seen in my entire life.

328
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:04,960
Speaking of online games, and this only goes out to the smart people, which are basically all of our listeners are smart, because they're listening to us.

329
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:16,960
If you go to squareenixusa.com, you can sign up, you can register to beta test Final Fantasy XI for PC or PS2.

330
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,960
Uh, you're right.

331
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,960
A PS2? That's funny.

332
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,960
That's a hilarious joke. I signed up for the PC one.

333
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:34,960
Because you know what? When Final Fantasy XI came out, first of all, my first impression was, this is the biggest pile of suck there could be.

334
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:43,960
And then the other thing was, I want to play it. If I get Final Fantasy XI, I have to have a hard drive. Maybe I can convince Dan to work that into the villas, get a hard drive for my PC.

335
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:57,960
Square should just say, okay, you know, this game really sucked ass. Maxis, what can we do to make this game better?

336
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:08,960
Fucking... No, fucking, we need Sims mixed with, you know, Final Fantasy. It's awesome. Sims is addicting. People love it. You know, they love creating shit, making new skins and all that crap.

337
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:15,960
But just, you know, with Final Fantasy, you have a little bit of fighting, a little bit of this, a little bit of that. It sounds good. I don't know.

338
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,960
Final Fantasy X was good.

339
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:23,960
Damn it, they're remaking all these Final Fantasy games, so why don't they remake Final Fantasy VI and CG Lock for me?

340
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,960
That'd be cool. And Shadow.

341
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:43,960
On a really random note, this kind of relates to Final Fantasy X, I was watching the new Christina Aguilera video last night, there's a new one, but it's like, it's really dark. Like, she had one of Marilyn Manson's video directors direct it, and now she's a slut in a corset, right?

342
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:49,960
Yeah, but that has to explain it for me, because I'm TV-deprived.

343
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,960
Is that the one where she turns in, like, a moth?

344
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,960
She's like stuck to a wall and then all the butterflies attack her.

345
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

346
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,960
All I could think of was like, wow, she really does kind of look like Riku.

347
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,960
I kind of have to see that if she dies. Did she die?

348
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,960
I don't think she died in the video, no.

349
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,960
But she gets attacked.

350
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,960
She gets attacked by, like, butterflies.

351
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,960
I might have to see that.

352
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,040
I don't really she doesn't really get attacked. It's supposed to be her coming out for cocoon

353
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,440
symbolic crack

354
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,140
She's going in her cocoon she's going in this assistant crack whore and coming out crack whore

355
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:32,940
No, she's going in as a crack whore. That means people pay for her. Uh-huh coming out as crack slut

356
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,240
No one wants to pay for her

357
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:42,240
You got to think of how many diseases you would catch.

358
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,240
That's where the full body condom comes into play.

359
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,240
Straight out of a freaking naked gun.

360
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,240
I see that Aggie Vera has cuties.

361
00:24:53,240 --> 00:25:00,740
So yeah, Orange Lounge Radio is going to be a new studio in the new world headquarters

362
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:06,900
in Folsom, California with a scenic view of Folsom State Prison.

363
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,900
Coming to you in two weeks.

364
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,140
Well, you can't really see the prison, but we're right next to the dam so we can laugh

365
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:14,140
at them in case if the dam gets blown up and then they flood Sacramento, we can just go,

366
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,140
ha ha!

367
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,140
You're getting flooded, we're on the hill.

368
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,140
Ha, you suck!

369
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,980
Hey, if that happens, videotape it for me or just call me.

370
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,980
I'll come over.

371
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,980
Okay.

372
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,980
I'll be there watching.

373
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,980
And it'll be a great excuse to work the word damn into our show as many times.

374
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,980
Damn that damn!

375
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,980
We're actually right next to the damn road.

376
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,980
Right by the damn nursery.

377
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,980
Yeah, come over, we live right by the damn road.

378
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,980
My brother was little when I went to Arizona to visit my mom.

379
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,980
We went to Vegas.

380
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,980
My brother seriously would call it the Hoover Darn.

381
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,980
Because damn is a bad word.

382
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,980
Oh! Oh, gee!

383
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,980
Isn't that weird?

384
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,980
We're gonna have so much stuff wired in that, um, new market.

385
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,980
I have good news, by the way.

386
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,980
Yes?

387
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,980
I'm gonna say this right now because I brought up my brother.

388
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,980
I got word that my brother who was in the, with the supply group with the Marines

389
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,980
is coming back around June 21st.

390
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,980
Which, cause they're the first to go and last to leave, so that'll...

391
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,980
From where?

392
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,980
From Iraq. He's in Iraq now, thank you.

393
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,980
I don't know.

394
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:24,500
yeah he's a marine stupid i love him anyway no i always thought the marines were like this elite

395
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,180
fighting force yet you see keep hearing more and more and more and more and more of them

396
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:33,780
you know being made i i don't know are they just like because they're on the front they're the

397
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:41,060
front so they're they they're first operation getting first in first out i can't believe you

398
00:26:41,060 --> 00:27:01,060
What's interesting is that one goes out and another goes in. Our friend, the other Jamie, we know, is going in. As one goes out, one goes in. Hope they don't make her do too many push-ups, but you know, does the body good.

399
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,060
uh...

400
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:05,500
i think that's actually from the military and i'm glad that

401
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,900
as horrible as it is

402
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,020
to be run over at thirteen and have your leg put back on

403
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:15,860
i'm glad that dam was run over and had his leg put back on because there's no possible way he could ever serve in the military

404
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,460
you know it's interesting and this has absolutely nothing to do with our show

405
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,580
but whatever who cares porn

406
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,100
yeah porn no

407
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,740
no this is not my dad not porn god

408
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,620
my dad was not able to go to the korean my dad's a little bit older than

409
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:33,660
probably a lot of your daddy's he was gonna go to the Korean War and they sent

410
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:39,700
him home because he has an extra vertebrae whoa I would think he'd be in

411
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:44,020
there it's like damn man if he gets hurt take one out he's normal it makes me

412
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,980
wonder though if I got that like I need to have somebody count I've never had a

413
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,180
doctor count like see if I have extra vertebrae have a certain amount I just

414
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,180
I thought they were just there.

415
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,180
Yeah.

416
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,180
Crazy, huh?

417
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,180
What?

418
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,180
Yeah.

419
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,180
Let's all count.

420
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,180
Actually...

421
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,180
Let me take my shirt off.

422
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:01,340
I recommend that you do this while you're driving.

423
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,340
It's just awesome.

424
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,900
Rob, keep your shirt on.

425
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,620
I've seen you in a corset.

426
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,940
So have I, unfortunately.

427
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:09,940
So have I.

428
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,940
That was...

429
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,980
Thank God it's a radio show, because I'm wearing it right now.

430
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:18,980
I was bored one day, and I was just like browsing the area, and I was like, you know, I'll read

431
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:23,980
I read live journals, read live journals, saw a link to the site, saw the pictures, I was like...

432
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:27,980
But actually, you know what's funny? My friend Sean thinks he knows you.

433
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:31,980
Because he used to do Rocky down at the Birdcage.

434
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,980
You think you know him?

435
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,980
And he thinks he knows you, too.

436
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,980
I never did Rocky.

437
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:41,980
Oh, you never did Rocky. Okay, he doesn't know you, then. He knows Jessica, maybe. I don't know.

438
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:45,980
We'll talk off air, because I bet our listeners really don't give a shit.

439
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:49,020
What do you mean? Who cares what they want? I did conventions!

440
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:54,020
I'm a cosplayer! Yay!

441
00:28:54,020 --> 00:29:04,020
Okay. So? What was the point? What's the point? That means I'm gonna go around and kill people, because cosplayers eventually go psycho, because one little thing goes wrong, and they go around killing everyone! Not really.

442
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,060
I need a machete.

443
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,060
You need a machete? Why?

444
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,060
I'm starting customer service.

445
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,060
Oh, your job starts tomorrow, huh?

446
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,060
No, it starts next Monday.

447
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:26,060
Oh, good. We have another week of fuck-off shows on Orange Lounge Radio that go till five in the morning.

448
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:41,060
No, no. See, me staying up till five in the morning, and then waking up at seven a.m., going back to sleep, getting up at ten a.m., going back to sleep...

449
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:47,060
I can't do this business of staying up till eight in the morning. I was staying up till eight in the morning on average.

450
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:52,060
You know what, last night I went to bed and the sun was coming up and I was like, God, I haven't done this in a long time.

451
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:59,060
Rob, I went to bed when the sun was already high overhead, so I did something really stupid.

452
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:08,060
I stayed up all day and all night, and I was inspired to write lots of fun stuff too.

453
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,060
Really?

454
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:21,060
I didn't write a damn thing because every time I start typing, I'd be like, why did I just type in Russian?

455
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:29,060
That's the most entertaining thing to do is you start typing and you start writing something and you're really, really tired and then you go back and read it and you're like, what the hell?

456
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:35,060
No, when I'm sleep deprived, I make the funniest typos. It's great. I started keeping a log of my typos.

457
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:40,120
I have a breaking news announcement.

458
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,960
Violent Hyper Girl, you may know her from Fremont II, she was the one, if you've seen

459
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,200
pictures from the Fremont II tournament, she was whipping me.

460
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,320
She is coming to Davis for college, which means puppy has someone to play with so he

461
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,480
won't get so bored, and somebody to meet us for boba.

462
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,560
But guess what?

463
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,320
I am getting another breaking news.

464
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,280
There's a Tap X in Sacramento now.

465
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,280

466
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,560
Pocket Road in a shopping center.

467
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:11,560
Skyline, find the address and give it to us NOW.

468
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:24,560
As Dark Tetsuya said earlier, is this going to be one of those shows? It's always one of those shows.

469
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,120
All right, we can talk about Bomani news, and I'll make it quick. Oh

I thought you were gonna go in the song. You know we need to be you know oh

Because we have a special one

Okay, we can tease this. I'm gonna play... I don't know the quality of this MP3, I just got it.

476
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,080
It's crap!

477
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,080
But you can... yeah, it's MP3. It's crap, though.

478
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,080
Okay, it's a crap one, but we'll try it. It's from Guitar Freaks. This is one of the Guitar Freaks.

479
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,080
Oh, this is pretty good quality.

480
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:09,080
Okay, good. This is the brand new B4U song from Guitar Freaks 9th of Drum Media 8th.

481
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:14,080
We'll see if it's any good or not. Chikara, I haven't heard this yet. Is it bad? We'll see.

482
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,080
We're gonna take a quick break.

483
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,080
B4U, what do you expect?

484
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,080
Okay, we'll be back after a quick break, and we're gonna talk about the Mani news, oh my God!

485
00:33:46,080 --> 00:34:01,720

504
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,720
21

505
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,720
22

506
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,720
23

507
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,720
24

508
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,720
25

509
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,720
26

510
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,720
27

511
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,720

512
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,720

513
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,720

514
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,720

515
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,720
32

516
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:49,320
And now something I want to hear, Suffer.

517
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,960
Run, Go, Run Man 22,

518
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,620
Go, Go, Go

519
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:59,620
Go, Go, Go

520
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,660
Now Go Go Go

521
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,280
Careful like this is the word

522
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,300
Don't risk your time

523
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,340
Don't never stop

524
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:24,340
Shouldn't know, God I'm strong Shouldn't know, God to the top

525
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:28,340
Como que hice a vez, que su patido que

526
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:31,340

529
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:42,340
Como nuestra por ella, we want it

530
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:46,340
See, we go, ale, ale, ale

531
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,840
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

532
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,840
Ya, ya, ya, ya

533
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,840
Tutti, tutti, tutti

534
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,840
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

535
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:47,360
Yari koi, yari koi, ojigori karata nara o

536
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:54,080
Yamanoda, are you a princess now?

537
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:47,840
Okay, we've been getting a lot of requests for this this week, so I'm going to play this

538
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,240
one more time.

539
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,720
Loki's mix for Slagwerk called the Dark Sakura will fuck you up mix.

540
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,120
And Loki, where can they download this?

541
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,960
Fuck if I know, I forgot to put it online.

542
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,960
Oops.

543
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,360
People have been asking me for it when I randomly go in chat room.

544
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,840
Yeah, if you beg Dark Sakura or myself, because I actually got a copy of it now in the chat

545
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,320
room from Jamie, thank you.

546
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,160
If you beg one of us for a copy, not during a show, not during a show because we're too

547
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,720
busy doing the show to send files, but if you beg us for one outside of show hours,

548
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,060
we will send you a copy of this lovely mix of Slagwerk by Loki.

549
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:22,060
And this fucking rocks. Nice job, Loki.

550
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,060
It's... it's... it's...

551
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:27,060
It's definitely worthy of the name Dark Sacral Will Fuck You Up.

552
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:30,060
It's the first good mix I've ever received.

553
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,060
Dark Sacral, what will you fuck up today?

554
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,060
What will I fuck up?

555
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,060
Awww! Jamie needs a hug!

556
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,060
I'll make your world up!

557
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,060
You're supposed to say the Easter Bunny.

558
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,060
I don't want to fuck the Easter Bunny!

559
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,060
Not!

560
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,060
I agree.

561
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:22,060
This is fucked up.

562
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:29,060
This is fucked up.

563
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:39,060
This is fucked up.

564
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:44,060
This is fucked up!

565
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,060
This is fucked up!

566
00:40:51,060 --> 00:41:20,740
From the Step Squad to Orange Labs, this PDR sucks!

567
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:34,300
And all those other acronyms I don't understand.

568
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,300
Big hello to StepSquad.

569
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,300
Any of you folks listening?

570
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,300
Yes.

571
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:43,760
A big hello to all of you listening because we love the people that listen to Orange Launch

572
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,240
Radio and that means you.

573
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,320
If you would like to join in the fun, the big gangbang orgy in our chatroom, I mean,

574
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:57,080
well, it's a Mississippi orgy because nobody in there is wearing shoes right now.

575
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,080
Yes.

576
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,800
The law is no socks, no shoes, and people of multiple genders.

577
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,040
All three or four or five of them.

578
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,040
That's a Mississippi orgy.

579
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,040
That's a Mississippi orgy.

580
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,640
We had a Mississippi orgy at my house the other night.

581
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,400
And then we kill each other with paper plates and magic markers and candles.

582
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,780
If you want to join in the big Mississippi orgy that is our chatroom, head on over to

583
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:24,780
www.calibomani.com

584
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:52,780
That was so easy.

585
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:55,780
I hate to say it, but you do get to sing for that.

586
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,780
Bitch.

587
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,780
Love you too.

588
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,780
No, when I saw it for the first time, it was kind of close, actually.

589
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:08,780
For the first time today, I saw G4 TV.

590
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,780
Because my parents have it, believe it or not.

591
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:12,780
Did it suck?

592
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,780
It was interesting.

593
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:21,660
You know we have game pro TV on a no game pro TV was not on I watched a show I watched something called

594
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,960
That's sad that I know that

595
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,140
Man we've already gone over this

596
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:39,380
That's still laughing um I watched I watched a show called

597
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:46,380
called, um, Blister, I think it was, with this guy who thought he was funny, who wasn't.

598
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:50,380
And, um, what was the other show I watched? Something called Cheat. Yeah, it was Cheat.

599
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,380
That's what it was called. And it was just them giving a lot of...

600
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,380
Cheat is not dead!

601
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,380
That's where Homestar Runner's gonna sell out to, G4.

602
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,380
Just a glass! Just a glass, Dad!

603
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:08,380
This is the funny thing, though. They didn't get a, um...

00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:16,140

607
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:33,020

608
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:34,020
Pussy!

609
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,020
Sing!

610
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:36,020
You got me.

611
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,020
You bitch.

612
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,020
All right.

613
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:43,020
Speak up my ass.

614
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,020
Speak up my ass?

615
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:45,020
We're running through the fucking mixing board.

616
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,020
No one has to speak up.

617
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,020
You turn your damn speakers up, okay?

618
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:53,020
I don't want to speak up my ass.

619
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:55,020
Anyway, oh, doorbell.

620
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:58,020
G4, really quick, because I know we have news we want to get to.

621
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,020
It was interesting.

622
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,020
We do?

623
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:02,020
Our show would work on G4.

624
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,020
Because we don't suck.

625
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:08,020
I wouldn't say G4 sucks. They're just new. They're in their infancy.

626
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:10,020
We need the next channel, G5.

627
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,020
We need...

628
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,020
I want G69.

629
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:13,020
We need...

630
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,020
Irene!

631
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,020
Oh, Irene's here.

632
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:22,020
And how dare they name that channel after a really shitty Macintosh computer. That's what I want to know.

633
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,020
You know...

634
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,020
Is it just you, or is Brad with you?

635
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,020
Brad's coming later. He's still up at G4.

636
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,020
Oh, okay.

637
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:34,020
You know, I could talk about Max, but that's getting into my fuck you of the week involving Julie's computer.

638
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:42,020
Promises that we do Bomani news when we came in back to this break, so I'll hand it off to Loki because he always has something to say Bomani related.

639
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:54,020
Gee, horrible surprise! We found out that DDR USA, or Max USA stuff, like, um, you know, Overblast, Peace Out, and, uh, there's one more, I think Jam of Marmalade.

640
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:57,620
Marmalade. Guess what? Those are going to be Max 2. Oh, surprise! Didn't call that like

641
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:03,700
a few weeks ago. Retards using old stuff again, but whatever. That's cool. We're going to

642
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:07,420
hopefully see these in the next arcade version because I want to play Jam Marmalade on the

643
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:13,780
arcade. But yeah, that's what's coming. Basically, you get an update every Thursday or Friday,

644
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:17,700
I believe, on their Max 2 site. They update it every week. And supposedly, this coming

645
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:23,420
up week, will be new codes for DDR Extreme. Supposedly, it will be the last codes, but

646
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:26,860
Who really gives a shit?

647
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:32,020
Fucking roulette! Fucking roulette! I hate you roulette!

648
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,520
Well, I'll bit into that later.

649
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:38,280
Yes, it's not time for the fuck use of a roulette.

650
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,960
Jamming Marmalade? What?

651
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:45,840
I didn't read anything. Oh yeah, it's rumored to be on there, I think. Or no, wait.

652
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,480
Oh, more paranoia, yay!

653
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,560
Yeah.

654
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,000
paranoia survivors rumored to be an unlock on max 2

655
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,560
but guess what

656
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:58,040
guess what glacial is

657
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:05,040
glacial is was a character in killer instinct

658
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,080
no

659
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,900
it's uh...

660
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,320
uh...

661
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:14,720
it's a cover song it's a cover song that might be for you it's an english song

662
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,560
uh...

663
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,960
i can't remember what the song is

664
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:26,960
It's a B4U cover of A Song. I can't remember, I posted about it like a while ago, but it's just escaped my mind right now.

665
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,960
Oh, if we go to the Max 2 side, I can tell you, because it says on it.

666
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:35,960
That's a future listless topic and waiting. B4U, the song we'd like to see B4U ruin.

667
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:40,960
I'll tell you what I'm worried about in the Mani news is freaking 9th Style.

668
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,960
9th Style, it's funny you bring that up. There is some...

669
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,960
I want more tack, and I want more tack now.

670
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,140
There are some tracks that have been leaked to the internet.

671
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:52,020
However, they're of a crappy quality.

672
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:54,520
But I'm going to play some clips for you guys anyway.

673
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,100
The reason why these are crappy quality is this is literally some guy

674
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:00,460
with a tape recorder walking into a Japanese arcade

675
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,300
to tape these for you guys and distribute them over the internet.

676
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,380
And bimonistyle.com sent them out to everybody.

677
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:08,780
And now everybody's got these, I think, by now.

678
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,460
But we're going to play some just in case you don't have some.

679
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,140
We'll play little clips.

680
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:15,500
This first one is a song called Distress, which

681
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:21,500
Is Taka remixed by Tack? We're just going to play a little clip of it.

682
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,500
Is it Tack remixed by Tack? Well, either way, it's pretty much Outfazed.

683
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,500
It's Outfazed-y.

684
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:31,500
So, let's hear a little clip, because this is kind of bad quality. We apologize, but it's all we got right now, but you can get a feel for it.

685
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:50,020
you can hear it you can hear that guitar sound in it that's in every tax on like a

686
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:56,020
remix of like stoic mixed with like diamond jealousy and like Yamaoka I know

687
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,860
But that's why I'm saying what it sounds like.

688
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:03,660
My tack door went off.

689
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:04,740
Tack door.

690
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:08,820
I'm now, I have to clean up, excuse me.

691
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,900
OK, while she's cleaning up, let's play a little bit of

692
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:11,900
the Abyss remix.

693
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,740
This is Abyss, the Heavens mix.

694
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:16,940
And if you remember Ryu, who did Star Mine in fourth mix,

695
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:18,300
he's the guy who remixed this.

696
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:19,900
So we'll hear a little clip of this.

697
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:37,300
It doesn't sound a goddamn thing like the original.

698
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:43,900
Judging by the key presses, which I heard very loudly, that's either a five or six.

699
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,740
Could have been light seven, just to throw you, though.

700
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:48,140
In fact, if they're recording it, they probably did it in light seven.

701
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:52,780
seven me trying to play a seven star song okay this one i'm really excited about this

702
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:56,560
is the new ping pong song power dream and this song really kicks ass i'm looking forward

703
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:07,560
to hearing the better quality version of this

704
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:23,040
That just totally sounds like digital mind.

705
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,040
A little bit.

706
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,040
A little bit.

707
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,120
But it's got its own happy carnival...

708
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,520
If it's tack, it's not happy.

709
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,720
Virtual mind.

710
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,720
I'm sorry.

711
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,720
Yes.

712
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,720
There you go.

713
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:35,720
Okay.

714
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:36,720
Okay.

715
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,720
If it's tack, it's not happy.

716
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:40,800
Shit, what's that other one?

717
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,040
Mind Parasite.

718
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,360
I knew it had mind in it, god damn it.

719
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:47,320
Mind Parasite, it sounds just like Mind Parasite.

720
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,080
OK, you sure?

721
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,080
You sure this time?

722
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,440
Positive.

723
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,240
No, wait, it's, it's.

724
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:56,120
It's Mind Over Matter, I don't know.

725
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,200
I've lost my mind.

726
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,360
They're coming to take me away, ha ha.

727
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,440
Next one we were going to preview for you, the last one

728
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,960
we're going to preview for you, this is Prelude.

729
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,400
And this is one I'm excited about.

730
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,480
This is the new Naoki Underground song.

731
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,480
I'm excited about the other one.

732
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,480
What?

733
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,480
About the Mime Parasite.

734
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,480
No, well I am, I'm, whatever.

735
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,480
Let's just hear this one.

736
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,480
Oh, I remember! Hold on!

737
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,480
Yeah, stop for a sec.

738
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,480
Glacial.

739
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:22,480
It was going to be a cover by Ryukosuka of Hyperurby.

740
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,480
Oh, God.

741
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,480
That's what it is.

742
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,480
Now I remembered.

743
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,480
I actually like Hyperurby.

744
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,480
There's one song I'm less excited about.

745
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,480
All right.

746
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,480
The new System SF song, yay, okay.

747
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:39,480
Uh, here we go. This is a little clip of Prelude by Naoki on the Ground. This is my favorite so far, I think.

748
00:51:39,480 --> 00:52:05,480
I was like, yay, it's another classical piece.

749
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,480
Yay, another classical piece.

750
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:12,400
Yeah, it's vanity angel all over again now. I'm going to preview for you prelude featuring Polteri

751
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:25,880
Rob yes, Rob. I'm sorry, but now you have to die give me that I

752
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:32,720
Have two microphones now. It's no no what that that should be is prelude featuring

753
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:40,720
If it was Prelude featuring someone farting, it would sound better than Polteri.

754
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,720
Anyway...

755
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:48,720
Prelude featuring my ass! Where's the burrito?

756
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:56,720
Prelude featuring my bunghole!

757
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:06,720
Another interesting bit of news here. I was given a tip, a lead, from a fellow in our chat room, goes by the name John Fields.

758
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:13,720
Project Majestic Mix. I have no idea who that is, but I think they're a band.

759
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:17,720
However, they have a newsletter, and this is what their newsletter says.

760
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:30,720
In light of our new dance album in the works, some of you may be interested to know that we have obtained permission and are working, planning to include our very own DDR PC Max CD-ROM game as part of the limited edition extra.

761
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,720
Your computer fell apart!

762
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,720
Rob, is your computer feeling really fresh?

763
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:42,720
You're laughing at the computer, not the story. My computer is just ghetto. Okay, let me finish. Can I finish? Can I finish?

764
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,720
And?

765
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,720
Majestic. Oh, they did remixes of Final Fantasy music.

766
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:53,720
Anyway, the whole graphics, sound effects, music, and announcer voices are planned to be 100% original.

767
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:59,720
We not only plan on including DDR versions of some of the new album music, but some remixes from our other album releases.

768
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:04,720
Gee, that sounds like step mania to me, ass. Freaking idiots.

769
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:08,720
Wait a minute. This could be officially Konami endorsed, though. That's the big deal about this.

770
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,720
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Sure.

771
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:15,720
Wait a minute though, wait a minute though. Would somebody who's putting out like a bonafide real album be that risky?

772
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,720
It's gotta be blessed by Konami if they're gonna rip off a DDR interval.

773
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:23,720
I'll have you know that my next track will be in the next DDR Max 3 for the home version, yes.

774
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:29,720
It's a new track. In fact, it's all my music. They're giving me all the proceeds from that, yes.

775
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:35,720
Could you listen to this part again, Loki? We have obtained permission. Which would mean Konami, right?

776
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:42,720
It means we've obtained permission to remix their music, saying that we won't permission to slap you.

777
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,720
That's all it says.

778
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:46,720
That means look for a press kit, look for the press releases.

779
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,720
It means don't jack shit.

780
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:50,720
It means jack shit, exactly.

781
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:57,720
It means that they've obtained permission to remix the official songs that they made from the DDR home versions.

782
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:59,720
That's all it is.

783
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,720
Can I remix this song?

784
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,720
Sure, son, why not?

785
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,720
Yay! I get to read it!

786
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,720
I was just thinking if there was anything on their site.

787
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:16,720
Whatever, you know, fine. If it is, yay, you know, whatever. DDR PC sucks anyways.

788
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,720
Mr. Spanky!

789
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:23,720
Well, we shall see what happens. Oh, maybe it's DDR Ultra Mix.

790
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:27,720
Alright, Majestic Mix, if you're listening, surprise the pants off a Loki, because that would be funny.

791
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,720
Maybe it's DDR Meow Mix.

792
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,720
DDR Meow Mix?

793
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,720
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

794
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,720
Did you tell everyone about the Will and Grace episode?

795
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,720
No, that was the next bit I was going to mention about. Why don't you tell us about it, Irene, since you brought it up?

796
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,720
Oh, there was DDR and Will and Grace.

797
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,720
You saw DDR on TV? No way.

798
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,720
Yeah, it was so cool.

799
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:51,720
Why don't you describe it for those folks that may not watch Will and Grace, or any TV at all, like Jamie?

800
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:56,720
Will and Grace is gay. Yeah, it's about, you know, a fag and his...

801
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,720
No, not the show, the episode.

802
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:05,720
Well, it's Grace's birthday, and Jack and Karen take her out to an arcade, and there's a fifth mix, and they play it.

803
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,720
What song do they play?

804
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:14,720
Well, they don't play songs that are really in DDRX. Well, Jack plays Holiday, but not like the DDR version.

805
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,720
I thought someone played Abyss or something.

806
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:20,720
Well, it has the background to Abyss, which is funny. Holiday has Abyss's background, apparently.

807
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,720
Yeah, like on the screen, it says Abyss, and he's playing Holiday.

808
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:30,320
Like when she's going to play another game there was like puzzle fighter 2 or something like it was playing abyss in the background and

809
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:34,260
It played dynamite rave also while the kid was playing a little kid was playing dynamite rave

810
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,680
And then grace it was so funny to watch grace dance

811
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:45,680
You make it sound like my anti-TV stance is, like, total social deprivation.

812
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,680
It is.

813
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:47,680
Well...

814
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:50,680
Shut up and ask yourself the wrong!

815
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:57,040
My life is much more enriched through reading fanfiction!

816
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,040
I mean, books.

817
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,880
But is DDR in your fanfic episodes?

818
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:02,880
Ha!

819
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:03,880
They could be.

820
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:04,880
I could...

821
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:09,000
I will put DDR in my next story, how's that?

822
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Fair enough.

823
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Let's see who comes through the door now. Who's going to get it? Loki!

824
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Oh, Brian's got it.

825
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I have no idea who's coming through the door.

826
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
It's our Intern Zero.

827
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Hello, do you have anybody with you?

828
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Um, yeah. This is Jim.

829
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Hi, Jim.

830
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
He's from Fremont.

831
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Hi, Jim from Fremont.

832
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Everyone can say hi.

833
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
And who else is here?

834
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Anita.

835
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Hi, Anita.

836
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Johnny.

837
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Hey, everybody.

838
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
And Jason.

839
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
What the hell? There's a party all of a sudden.

840
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Yeah, we all fit in the clown car.

841
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I'm sitting here going,

842
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Gee, we've got like only the three of us here in house and then all of a sudden everybody's showing up.

843
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Yeah, the clown car's showing up.

844
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Hello.

845
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Sup everyone, this is Jim. Nice to meet you all.

846
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Do you play DDR at all?

847
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
I'm afraid to say no.

848
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
You'll fit right in. Alright, Anita.

849
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Hi, DDRcaholic here. How is everybody?

850
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Good, how's your DDR addiction?

851
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Oh, well, I'm on step nine of the 12-step program. It's coming along. It's coming along fine.

852
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Remember, Nyquil's the thirteenth step.

853
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Nyquil is the thirteenth step, and I am almost ready with my case of Nyquil. I'm just waiting to open it.

854
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
And we have...

855
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,000
It's the child. God, I'm so fucking tired right now.

856
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Well, how late did you stay up?

857
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Uh...

858
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Did you stay up to greet the Easter Bunny?

859
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Easter Bunny?

860
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Yeah.

861
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,840
I greeted the Easter Bunny all right.

862
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,560
Where's my damn candy?

863
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,960
Yeah, so anyway, DDR on Will and Grace.

864
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:46,960
Ha, that was funny.

865
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:47,960
On Will and Grace?

866
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:53,040
It was a vidmix, and it was showing singles on the screen, but they were playing doubles,

867
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,040
both of them.

868
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,440
Like, Jack was on the completely wrong side.

869
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,160
He was on the right side, and it was supposed to be on the left side of the screen.

870
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,920
I like it when idiots pretend to be cool on TV.

871
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:24,920
Who else is here? Oh, there's somebody in the hall!

872
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,920
Oh, this is Bombay.

873
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,920
I'm also tired.

874
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,920
Me too.

875
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:33,920
I got to beat your character up today in Soul Calibur.

876
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,920
Did you beat her hard?

877
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,920
I beat her long and hard.

878
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,920
With my lesbian character.

879
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,920
With the big titties. They're all lesbians.

880
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:48,920
This is the first time I played Soul Calibur 2 in a long, long time.

881
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:52,920
She's the dyke of the game. She's also the dominatrix.

882
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,920
But then suddenly I was, I was...

883
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:56,920
Shaggy is, she does whatever. She's good for anything.

884
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,920
And then Cassandra's the quick lay. She does everybody.

885
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,920
Conquest came up and suddenly I'm fighting D-child. I'm like...

886
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,920
Did you, did you fight F-Yo Mama?

887
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,920
Uh, I don't remember fighting F-Yo Mama.

888
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:20,920
That's it. You're going to find an achillic named Dark Sakura in there.

889
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:24,920
Okay, news flash.

890
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,920
Yeah, his special attribute is cheap bitch power.

891
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:31,920
News flash, we have the address to the new Tap-X from Skyline.

892
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,920
There's a Tap-X in Sacramento now, in South Sac.

893
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:37,920
Oh, bitches, my dad was going to make one and then they brought one here.

894
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:38,920
Yep.

895
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,920
Yeah, there's one in South Sac now, so we might go after the show.

896
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:50,920
Alright, I'd just like to say, coming from the Bay Area where there's real Boba and real Pearl Tea, Tapioca Express is gay.

897
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,920
It's all we got!

898
01:00:52,920 --> 01:01:00,920
It's really not that bad, I mean, I've tried some of the, that Boba that we had at that one place in Fremont, was that real Boba?

899
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,920
Okay, their Boba is just as good.

900
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,920
What, like lollipop?

901
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:06,920
I don't know.

902
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:42,200
Which I must say that this car, while being in the movie, was stock, and it just had a

903
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:48,600
nice paint job, which was sort of getting shipped, and actually someone stole the exhaust

904
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:49,600
off of it.

905
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:54,040
They physically cut the exhaust off with a hacksaw, that was hilarious.

906
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:59,020
But yeah, it was really cool, and no one could tell, but I took my friend Andy, who's kind

907
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:02,440
of a fanatic about the whole thing, and he took pictures of him taking the car off of

908
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:06,800
the trailer and stuff, and then I took a picture inside the car. So I thought it'd be really

909
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:11,600
funny, because, you know, I was really bored that day, to post pictures online of me sitting

910
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:15,800
in the car telling people that I bought the car off of eBay. Because if anyone knows me,

911
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:21,060
I am just been buying shit off of eBay like crazy. So it's slightly believable. But then

912
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:22,060
again, yeah.

913
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:27,280
I first started getting suspicious when I saw it was parked on a sidewalk. But then

914
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,480
just to check on how much they were, it went on eBay. And those cars aren't at that price.

915
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:36,960
I saw a beamer that was like fully tricked out for under 30 grand and I mean beamers for under 30 grand. That's pretty good

916
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:41,640
Yeah, so anyways I had a couple people go in there for like a little bit

917
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:46,400
I was waiting for Rob because Rob I was thinking you know I see now

918
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:52,040
It was so much for afterthought, but um I was gonna say you know I should have posted yeah, Rob

919
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:57,400
I need the bar like five hundred dollars because I spent too much money on this, but instead no

920
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,400
No, I didn't do that, so that kind of thing.

921
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,400
Oh, you're so kind.

922
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,400
And he saw right through, because he knew me better. He knew that I'd buy a DDR machine before I'd buy a nice car, so...

923
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,400
Yeah.

924
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,400
I got you!

925
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,400
I try.

926
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,400
I'm fucking great.

927
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,400
Uh, okay, so...

928
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,400
Hmm.

929
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,400
Oh!

930
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,400
Any other mind news, you think?

931
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,400
Uh, Ultramix.

932
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,400
Is there new news on Ultramix?

933
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,400
Uh, no.

934
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,400
Well, thanks!

935
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,400
Bravo!

936
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:34,840
fair and limbo. Um, shit, um, not really anything else. Um, well there's some news, I guess.

937
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:40,120
Oh, what about Turnimix 4? Turnimix 4 has been announced. It's going to be on June 15th.

938
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:49,480
That's all. That's all I've got. This is the date. Just June 15th. And um, and uh, oh yeah,

939
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:53,400
we were still going to be doing a TV show DWI contest, but um, we got lazy and haven't

940
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:58,400
I haven't really planned for it yet, so look for a big announcement at B3.

941
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,400
Okay.

942
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,400
Yes.

943
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:01,400
Yes, look for that.

944
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:05,400
That'll give us plenty of time to get up off our ass and do something.

945
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,400
There's also, well, a couple things.

946
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:11,400
Bomani's style, they've opened up, well, they're going to be opening up.

947
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,400
I haven't gotten my email yet.

948
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:17,400
But opening up a Leech server for all those who contributed to them, which I did.

949
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,400
So I will get access to a Leech server with a bunch of cool shit on.

950
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,400
Ooh, you're special.

951
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,400
I know I am.

952
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:38,400
And then there's also, let's see, this guy Shuey, who I've been working with, he's starting a project called, was it the DWI History project or whatever, anyways, he has up to date every single sim file that's ever been made, pretty much.

953
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:46,400
Another question coming from the chatroom from Skyline, are we going to E3? Probably not. Unless someone gives us tickets really fast.

954
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,400
I've been asking that in, um...

955
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:52,400
I can get the time off work in Jiffy, but...

956
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,400
I've been asking that, but I don't know.

957
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:05,400
I don't know. I have tickets for The Matrix Reloaded that day, so it's a gimme.

958
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,400
I was like, I wanna see The Matrix.

959
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:13,400
I don't know. To be honest, I don't think I have the money to go to E3, but I would like to anyway.

960
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:14,400
I do. I wanna go.

961
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:27,400
Let's go hang out on the street corner in front of BE3 and see if we can't get in.

962
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,400
Okay!

963
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:33,400
We can film it and do wacky shit and disguise ourselves like stuff.

964
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,400
Hey, where's the wacky media?

965
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:41,400
We can pretend we're bombs and then the bomb fight people will pay us to beat each other up and I'll kick your ass.

966
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:45,400
And you know, someone with some kind of military-based first-person shooter is bound to be there.

967
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:49,400
We can just rob up like a booth babe.

968
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,400
I can be Riku.

969
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:58,400
With all the military games, just dress in camel and walk right in like you're part of the show.

970
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:04,400
Okay, we wanted to do a list list pretty soon here, but we need time to think about it.

971
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:08,400
Yeah, we need to do FUs of the Week still, and we need to do the Cage Match.

972
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,400
So, what first? Ffuse or cage match?

973
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,400
Ffuse.

974
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:16,400
Ffuse. Alright, fine. We're gonna go to a quick break, and we'll come back and do the Ffuse of the Week.

975
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:23,400
Okay, kids? So, you can send them over a private message to Muah, my name is Sky High, and I'm in the chat room.

976
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:24,400
Sky High!

977
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,400
Yes, Sky High. Very cute.

978
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,400
I made a bunny!

979
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:36,400
Yeah, I'm in the chat room and just send me your FUs of the week over private message and we'll get to those right when we come back.

980
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:44,400
In the meantime, here's that new special little Paranoia that's going to be in Max 2, or so they say, the Japanese home release coming out this week.

981
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:50,400
This is Paranoia Sur- and I have it on order too, with the VRare soundtrack. Yay!

982
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,400
Here's a cookie. Here's Paranoia Survivor, enjoy.

983
01:06:54,400 --> 01:07:01,400
enjoy

984
01:08:54,400 --> 01:09:19,520
I feel, I feel, I feel You are the only one, let me feel this way

985
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:39,240
I feel, I feel, I feel You are the only one that should be on the

986
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:43,240
Go on the other way, boy, let's leave it on the way

987
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:34,240
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

988
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:39,240
This server made up it's minding head number. This server made up it's minding head number.

989
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,240
I call you Squeenix because you suck.

990
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:15,240
Fuck you for not listening to me and for not listening to Michelle because we had this discussion earlier today.

991
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:20,240
Damn you for sucking so bad for not making Kingdom Hearts the way we want you to.

992
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:28,240
First of all, thank you for waiting until 2004 to release Kingdom Hearts 2.

993
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:30,240
Bitches.

994
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:37,240
Damn you, for not taking advantage of your other licensing.

995
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:45,240
And I can tell you this right now, that if you do not take advantage of the Enix Association, and go and bless the moon characters on Kingdom Hearts 2,

996
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:49,240
I will personally go to Tokyo in a tank, and run you all over.

997
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:56,240
I will put collars on your necks, and enact battle royale, and then whoever wins the battle royale,

998
01:12:56,240 --> 01:13:01,240
I'll go, okay, you can go. We'll take the collar off and then I'll stick a knife in your head.

999
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:05,240
Gosh, Jamie, you're really mean.

1000
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:14,240
No, no, no, no, no. Before I put the knife in their head, I'll shave their balls with a cheese grater and pour alcohol on it.

1001
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:17,240
She's productive, okay?

1002
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:19,240
I get results, yes.

1003
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:20,240
That's right.

1004
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:21,240
And then once I...

1005
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:23,240
You'll feed them the flakes first.

1006
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:30,240
and

1007
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,760
not wasting one thing

1008
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:42,020
and

1009
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:42,840
first of all

1010
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:44,220
i'm gonna give it a cool name

1011
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:47,680
it'll be called

1012
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:48,980
spike

1013
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:55,980
It'll be called, um, Not Squee Mix, how's that?

1014
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:59,980
And then, once I've taken it over, I'm gonna make my own freakin' RPG,

1015
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:04,980
because I'm gonna take advantage of all those licenses, and because of the association with Sony,

1016
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:09,980
Sony's got their fingers in everything, I'm gonna have the ultimate RPG.

1017
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:14,980
I can think of one thing they don't have their fingers in.

1018
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:17,980
I'm just sayin'!

1019
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:25,980
And then, and then, and then, I'm going to make my own gaming system, because nothing that's out right now will be able to use it.

1020
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:30,980
And then I'm going to take over Gravity and make Ragnarok Online cool.

1021
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:33,980
I'm not making an Xbox.

1022
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:39,980
...for them, you know, they're like, fuck you all, we're making it for our system, you can't have it unless you buy our expensive system.

1023
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:43,980
All I heard Jamie say was I'm taking over Gravity.

1024
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:47,980
Like, now she's taking out the force. Mother Nature, burn!

1025
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:53,980
Yeah, fuck you Nature. I'm rewriting physics, dammit. I've got the mole diver power.

1026
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:58,980
Anyway, my next budget of the week goes toward this troll who was on the road behind me.

1027
01:14:58,980 --> 01:14:59,980
There's more?

1028
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:01,980
There's more.

1029
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:05,980
This... and it gets... and it gets...

1030
01:15:05,980 --> 01:15:08,980
Again, I'm not a shallow person, usually.

1031
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:12,980
This person made me think that Trogdor was gorgeous.

1032
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:16,980
This person...

1033
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:20,980
This person made Corky in the Wonder Years.

1034
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:23,980
You mean, uh, Life Goes On?

1035
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:24,980
Life Goes On.

1036
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:26,980
Looked like a beauty queen.

1037
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:33,980
I missed America.

1038
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:35,980
And then this bitch...

1039
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:36,980
What?

1040
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:46,980
She decides to tailgate me, going from my apartment to Gero's, and then gets me out of the way and I'm like, yo, I'm gonna pass her?

1041
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:54,980
So, I start going, when she's right behind me, I start going five miles an hour on Gero's.

1042
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:58,980
She's these, I go 50.

1043
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:05,980
I was like, bless you, car, for having some acceleration this time. Let's hear it for high oxygen gas.

1044
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:08,540
my other fuck you of the week

1045
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:10,620
goes toward not having money

1046
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:15,620
until after i work some more

1047
01:16:15,620 --> 01:16:19,620
we wouldn't have fuck yous of the week if it was for me

1048
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:24,340
it goes toward not having money so i couldn't go to the fact of the last three yesterday

for American life sucks my balls.

1148
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:20,220
It is the worst, most unimaginative thing I've ever seen in my life.

1149
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:24,020
original video was better way way better you know it wasn't the best video you've

1150
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:27,340
done but it was way better than that piece of shit you put on vh1 you know

1151
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:29,980
if you don't want to ruffle feathers with the whole anti-war thing even

1152
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:35,260
though the video is an anti-war it's all like tongue-in-cheek anyway just spend

1153
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:39,980
$50 at least to make a decent video I did college projects that were better

1154
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:44,220

01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:22,180
that your brains are attached to, and your whole life depends on, and you have those social experiences, and you don't even see them, and you don't even have no idea what you're talking about. Next.

1164
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:28,180
Don't you do that when you play, um, the fantasy card, playing that fantasy card, is that a talent passing or not?

1165
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:34,180
First of all, I've gotten, um, maybe to, uh, the save point after you do the daibii thing.

1166
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:37,180
Yes. No, you're not there.

1167
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:43,180
Yeah, you were there. I got to the daibii card, and then I saved, and I haven't played since.

1168
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:45,180
The computer does it, too.

1169
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:48,180
Fuck Final Fantasy II International, by the way.

1170
01:23:48,180 --> 01:23:51,180
For being easy. Oh my god.

1171
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:53,180
Let's move on to the rest of the room chatroom.

1172
01:23:53,180 --> 01:23:54,180
Or, the rest of the room FUs.

1173
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:55,180
Zero!

1174
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:58,180
Oh, that's really cool. I have, like, a Madonna FU, too.

1175
01:23:58,180 --> 01:23:59,180
Okay.

1176
01:23:59,180 --> 01:24:03,180
It's pretty sad. No, today, I was watching... television!

1177
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:09,180
And, anyways, um, they were talking about how she's trying to make a, uh, uh, effort against...

1178
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:11,180
Okay, fuck TV.

1179
01:24:11,180 --> 01:24:27,180
Anyways, yeah, like I was trying to say as she hops out of the room, she's trying to combat music piracy also, she had a bunch of people get online, and she has her actual voice, where you'll download the full length of the song, right?

1180
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:32,180
But it'll just start off the first six seconds, the only thing it'll say, what the fuck do you think you're doing?

1181
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:34,180
That was fucking great, actually.

1182
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:39,180
It's funny, but it's like, you really think you're gonna do something.

1183
01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:43,180
You know, she's not the only one doing that, though. I tried to download the new JUUL single. Don't ask me why, I just was.

1184
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:45,180
And it did the same thing.

1185
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:48,180
Well, you see, if she wasn't going, what the fuck are you looking at? It just looped the chorus over and over.

1186
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:52,180
And I've got no doubts on it that people are doing that, all the stuff.

1187
01:24:52,180 --> 01:24:56,180
Yeah, you know what? That's not going to stop anything. You can do whatever.

1188
01:24:56,180 --> 01:25:02,180
Good luck, RIAA. You suck. You're never going to fucking stop us from pirating your music.

1189
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:05,180
I laugh at you wasting billions of dollars trying to try.

1190
01:25:05,180 --> 01:25:08,180
Go ahead! We'll just go out and find a way around that.

1191
01:25:08,180 --> 01:25:11,180
You go, boy.

1192
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:12,180
Zero.

1193
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:13,180
It's not very hard.

1194
01:25:13,180 --> 01:25:14,180
No, um, another one.

1195
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:16,180
I gotta give an F key to my fucking computer.

1196
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:18,180
No, fuck you to cable, having a cable modem.

1197
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:21,180
I have to burn a fucking CD every goddamn day.

1198
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:26,180
Because, like, first of all, my fucking computer is a piece of shit and has a small hard drive.

1199
01:25:26,180 --> 01:25:28,180
I fill it up with music, like, every day.

1200
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:31,180
I don't have the money for a new fucking hard drive.

1201
01:25:31,180 --> 01:25:33,180
I don't have the money for that yet until I get a job.

1202
01:25:33,180 --> 01:25:35,180
Wait, I have a job. I start tomorrow. All right.

1203
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:38,860
like I have to burn a CD I'm already out of fucking CDs because fucking music is

1204
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:49,340

I was sitting there and a stupid credit card bitch came and ran into me and knocked me into the

1217
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:47,340
bowl on the corner when I was walking up to get a calling card and she said

1218
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:51,340
that I was a bitch and she said she was going to cut me because I called her a credit card

1219
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:55,340
but anyways that's all my FUs because that was fucking stupid and fuck you I'm not having any more FUs

1220
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:57,340

1226
01:27:53,740 --> 01:27:57,740
Jim, did somebody have FUs for somebody else?

1227
01:27:57,740 --> 01:27:59,740
Okay, Zero, give the FUs for somebody else.

1228
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:01,740
Okay, this is kind of like a battle FU between them.

1229
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:04,740
But, like, Darkchild, first off, he says,

1230
01:28:04,740 --> 01:28:08,740
Fuck you to loud-ass bass at three o'clock in the morning as he's trying to sleep.

1231
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:12,740
I guess apparently Bombay was playing his music a little bit too loud at three o'clock in the morning.

1232
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:13,740
Kiss, kiss.

1233
01:28:13,740 --> 01:28:17,740
Yes, well, yeah, that's right, we need to get him some boxes, huh?

1234
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:22,740
No, seriously, I'll come over and help this week and pack his stuff up for you.

1235
01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:24,740
Can we put it on the driveway?

1236
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:26,740
Switchcone's a great place.

1237
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:28,740
Wait, we can do the whole strong, bad thing.

1238
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:34,740
Maybe we should put your stereo on the street and find more stuff you'd like to give to me.

1239
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:35,740
I mean, the people.

1240
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:37,740
I'll put it in the driveway back over it.

1241
01:28:37,740 --> 01:28:39,740
Except I don't want all that stuff to get in my wheels.

1242
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:40,740
And views!

1243
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:42,740
Okay, but anyways, yeah. Back to that, yeah.

1244
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:43,740
He got pretty pissed off.

1245
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:44,740
I was talking about taking someone's life up.

1246
01:28:44,740 --> 01:28:49,740
And he said that if he wasn't so tired, he would have got up and beat some ass.

1247
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:51,740
I wish he was awake.

1248
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:59,740
And then he says, fuck you to 80s... Hold on! Damn, fucking 80s, all of a sudden everyone fucks around and gets pissed off.

1249
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:01,740
What?!

1250
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:04,740
Fuck everyone. No, he says fuck you to 80s...

1251
01:29:04,740 --> 01:29:06,740
What you talking about, Zero?

1252
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:09,740
Oh my God. Fuck you! I heard that shit.

1253
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:17,740
No, um, he said, um, fuck you to 80s techno beats and shit because they're all repetitive and looping and he says they suck ass.

1254
01:29:17,740 --> 01:29:27,740
And then, and then the one from DDRchaholic, she decides to say fuck you to Darkchild because she thinks 80s techno is good.

1255
01:29:27,740 --> 01:29:29,740
Anita's a goddess, what can I say?

1256
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:35,740
Yeah, but I kinda wish that, um, Darkchild was awake in the middle of the night, because that would've been funny to hear.

1257
01:29:35,740 --> 01:29:40,740
At 3.30 in the morning, he gets up and runs out to, like, kill somebody for techno. That'd be cool.

1258
01:29:43,740 --> 01:29:44,740
Rawr. Yeah, I'm done.

1259
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:45,740
I just have one.

1260
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:52,740
Speaking of the 80s, and that sort of reminding me of the conversation from earlier.

1261
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:54,740
Fuck you to Captain N, the Game Master.

1262
01:29:54,740 --> 01:29:56,740
Holy shit, I downloaded a bunch of episodes.

1263
01:29:56,740 --> 01:29:58,740
That show sucks ass.

1264
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:00,740
That show was the worst ever, because...

1265
01:30:00,740 --> 01:30:03,740
And skewed so many of my viewpoints in video game history.

1266
01:30:03,740 --> 01:30:07,740
Simon was a lot more, like, ballsier than it made him to be.

1267
01:30:07,740 --> 01:30:09,740
Mega high!

1268
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:12,740
But yeah, fuck that show, I just had a memory of that show.

1269
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:15,740
Anyway, I'm gonna fuck all of them.

1270
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:17,740
Ah!

1271
01:30:17,740 --> 01:30:18,740
I'll keep that one.

1272
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:20,740
Hi.

1273
01:30:20,740 --> 01:30:21,740
This is Jim.

1274
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:22,740
Yes.

1275
01:30:22,740 --> 01:30:27,740
Uh, you can call me Geist if you want, it's, uh, my handle, I kind of pick up myself.

1276
01:30:27,740 --> 01:30:34,540
But I don't know. I'm kind of vague on my FUs, really. Can't think of many particular

1277
01:30:34,540 --> 01:30:43,580
things. But, shit. I don't know. FU, really, to, hey, you mentioned reality shows and shit

1278
01:30:43,580 --> 01:30:49,180
like that. And so, a fair amount of the people who actually watch that shit, who, you know,

1279
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:54,900
seems to have no real purpose in their lives to spend hours on end in the days to watch

1280
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:55,900
this shit all the time.

1281
01:30:55,900 --> 01:31:00,540
talking about asshole

1282
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:03,320
i don't know if we can stand as a reality

1283
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:06,640
this because it's not exactly reality

1284
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:07,980
i mean i don't agree

1285
01:31:07,980 --> 01:31:09,360
the reality movie

1286
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:10,760
that's too much

1287
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:12,240
exactly

1288
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:13,400
don't even go there

1289
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:14,180
fucking

1290
01:31:14,180 --> 01:31:16,580
that's the dumbest fucking thing i've ever seen

1291
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:18,080
god damn real world

1292
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:19,080
die!

1293
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:26,300
Dude, it went up into the yellow. That was cool. And your face is purple.

1294
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:28,300
My ears are bleeding and your face is purple, Jim?

1295
01:31:28,300 --> 01:31:43,140
Oh, yeah. God, I've got a scatterbrain right now. I can't think of many FUs. This is my

1296
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:47,900
Dark Side talking. You know, fuck you to the entire human race because, you know, you are

1297
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:54,380
The plague that is eating this planet alive, like, hell, exactly, getting on a little Matrix

1298
01:31:54,380 --> 01:32:05,380
show, exactly what Agent Smith said, we are a virus, we are a parasite to this planet.

1299
01:32:05,380 --> 01:32:09,460
I mean, we're pretty much just going to do that shit to every other planet we meet up

1300
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:17,580
in along the way, but, eh, yeah, that's it.

1301
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:19,580
Alright, chat room FUs.

1302
01:32:19,580 --> 01:32:21,580
Fuck the chat room FUs.

1303
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:28,580
DDR Angel, my first FU goes to those stupid people, companies, whatever, that send you those damn text messages to your phone wanting you to buy their shit.

1304
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:34,580
I don't care, I don't need your crap, and stop wasting my monthly 200 text messages there for my friends and not you. Grr.

1305
01:32:34,580 --> 01:32:38,580
FU to my work schedule because I'm going to miss a lot of Orange Onch Radio this week. FU to that.

1306
01:32:38,580 --> 01:32:41,580
You know what, you can just get free text messaging like I have.

1307
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:44,580
I would also recommend suing the companies that are sending that shit to you.

1308
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:46,580
You can!

1309
01:32:46,580 --> 01:32:55,580
John Fields says, F you to people calling me a cult leader and trying to sue me for killing someone when that person is still alive and they know that person is alive.

1310
01:32:55,580 --> 01:32:58,580
Huh? That was scary.

1311
01:32:58,580 --> 01:33:05,580
F you to that person who caused it by faking their own death to get off the net.

1312
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:07,580
Wow.

1313
01:33:07,580 --> 01:33:13,580
One more, F you to not being able to DDR more than one game because of not having enough energy even after a full night of sleep.

1314
01:33:13,580 --> 01:33:17,180
whole night of sleep. Wait, let me go back to this. Somebody faked their own death on

1315
01:33:17,180 --> 01:33:21,420
the internet, and then this guy, our guy in the chatroom, John Peels, gets blamed as being

1316
01:33:21,420 --> 01:33:24,780
a cult leader and gets sued for killing that person.

1317
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:25,860
Okay, first of all...

1318
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:27,500
How in the hell did that happen?

1319
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:31,260
First of all, the whole faking your whole death thing on the internet, if anyone falls

1320
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:38,060
for that bullshit, they're so stupid. You know? I've had people try to pull that stuff

1321
01:33:38,060 --> 01:33:42,060
and then I just, you know, traced their IP and found other places that they're posting.

1322
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:47,060
That is so weird. Wow.

1323
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:48,060
That's so stupid.

1324
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:52,060
As the internet turns, as the world wide web turns.

1325
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:57,060
Alright, violenthypergirl would like to give a big F.U. to AP Practice Exams and Bitchy Club Advisors.

1326
01:33:57,060 --> 01:34:04,060
Another F.U. to the Milpitas Golf Land AZN Idiots, who think they're good and then run away from the machine when I start freestyling.

1327
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:07,060
Yeah.

1328
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:10,380
Muhymer would like to say, fuck stupid friends again.

1329
01:34:10,380 --> 01:34:15,020
Fuck almost going to Ocean City to play DDR, but then my parents are being like, uh, no,

1330
01:34:15,020 --> 01:34:16,020
but I'm going Tuesday anyway.

1331
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:17,020
You know what's funny?

1332
01:34:17,020 --> 01:34:18,020
Ocean City is that town.

1333
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:21,060
You ever drive through Sacramento and it's like where Highway 50 starts and they have

1334
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:25,100
like, oh, Sacramento's this far away and Lake Tahoe's this far away and Ocean City, Maryland

1335
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:27,780
is this far away because that's where Highway 50 ends.

1336
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:28,780
Isn't that funny?

1337
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:29,780
I don't know.

1338
01:34:29,780 --> 01:34:31,780
I thought it was funny, I don't know.

1339
01:34:31,780 --> 01:34:32,780
Well, Rob.

1340
01:34:32,780 --> 01:34:36,820
Fuck online games for being so addicting, although I must say sissyfight.com is strangely

1341
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:40,000
fun

1342
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,940
after this is that's like but back in the background

1343
01:34:43,940 --> 01:34:47,640
hey i think that's that's what i would like to give an f you to all the spam i

1344
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:49,400
think getting lately

1345
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:52,000
the sculpture

1346
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,200
that's why you

1347
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:54,520
market

1348
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:58,520
well at the end acuity chasers heavy steps on the extreme not matching your

1349
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:05,520
max's u s a

1350
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:11,520
I would like to say a big F U to boring, eventless spring breaks. Now I'm fat again.

1351
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:14,520
Oh, poor baby!

1352
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:18,520
Stop watching reality TV and go play some TDR.

1353
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:21,520
Fraternity life sucks also, I'd just like you to know.

1354
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:24,520
When someone hates reality TV, you're watching an awful lot of it.

1355
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:29,520
I was bored yesterday! It was all that was on! I was waiting for a show I'll talk about later.

1356
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:33,520
Anyway, Japan Man would like to say fuck me for forgetting the show. That is all.

1357
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:38,540
Yeah, fuck you. Fuck you. No, just kidding. It's cool. It happened. Thank you, man. I almost forgot the show today

1358
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:43,780
Japan man would also like to say fuck certain people that make fun of me when I fail on bag

1359
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:45,780
And I'm 50 times better than them

1360
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:50,680
Fuck memories on now. Can you will neo standard? It's a bitch, but I finally beat it. Whoo and

1361
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:54,880
What the fuck fuck the test our state makes us take every fucking year die

1362
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Oh, so Jimmy

1363
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:03,000
it's alright. Bryce, R-Y-C 3, that's why I said that.

1364
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:07,000
R-Y-C 3 would like to say,

1365
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Fuck you dumb fucks and SoCal guys who have no chance on getting with the girls they want to get with, then later crying over it to me because they got rejected.

1366
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Fuck you to being single.

1367
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Amen.

1368
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Fuck you to kids, free teens at work, testing my patience in the counter giving prizes for tickets.

1369
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Haha!

1370
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:26,000
23rd Magus would like to say,

1371
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Kentucky

1372
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Fu to spending a week in Kentucky

1373
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,580
Fu to the flight to Kentucky

1374
01:36:29,580 --> 01:36:31,800
Fu to turbulence on the flight back to Kentucky

1375
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:34,640
Fu to having the leech money off mom to buy angel a ring in Kentucky

1376
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:35,800
Hands Angel a ring

1377
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:39,780
Fu to getting mom's I.P. ban from DJ Bad while I was in Kentucky

1378
01:36:39,780 --> 01:36:41,740
Fu to missing Orange Line while I was in Kentucky

1379
01:36:41,740 --> 01:36:43,560
Fu to having nothing to do in Kentucky

1380
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:50,560
but pretty much if you do kentucky

1381
01:36:51,580 --> 01:36:58,580
i want to know if you brought back chicken

1382
01:37:00,180 --> 01:37:01,860
more than jake five forty three

1383
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:03,300
if you to boring breaks

1384
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:06,140
false hope sports not being made out of metal

1385
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:07,860
that's a good one

1386
01:37:07,860 --> 01:37:09,840
people who think punk is fashion

1387
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:11,020
and uh...

1388
01:37:11,020 --> 01:37:14,140
When you send your FUs to the wrong person

1389
01:37:14,140 --> 01:37:17,740
and the fact that I lost my battle royale in my hard drive crash of last week

1390
01:37:17,740 --> 01:37:22,740
Oh yes, FU to american item

1391
01:37:22,740 --> 01:37:25,660
You know what, actually I need to throw in one more fuck you

1392
01:37:25,660 --> 01:37:27,900
Fuck you to 800 megabyte

1393
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:32,420
binq files that I don't have the disks that are capable of burning

1394
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:34,340
battle royale to right now

1395
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:35,780
Zip them up? Does it work?

1396
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:39,900
No, it's the file to burn to the binq

1397
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:41,940
And I can't copy the file off.

1398
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:43,540
That's weird.

1399
01:37:43,540 --> 01:37:47,220
You know they do have things to rip being Q-Files.

1400
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:54,220
I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about the file itself being too big to burn to a CD.

1401
01:37:54,820 --> 01:37:58,640
Vidpala would like to say, F you to school. I don't want to go back after vacation.

1402
01:37:58,640 --> 01:38:03,640
And F you to myself for bringing all the things needed to play 2DX to the party, except the controller.

1403
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:06,240
That was funny. Who was that?

1404
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:08,600
Vidpala.

1405
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:49,200
F.U. to my stupid computer that likes to reset itself for no apparent reason. It's not even

1406
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:55,720
an old computer. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the one-hour-long F.U. of the Week. Congratulations.

1407
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:56,720
Yay!

1408
01:38:56,720 --> 01:39:00,560
You know why your computer resets?

1409
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:01,560
Why?

1410
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:06,880
Because probably your fan on your heat sink is dirty and your computer's overheating.

1411
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:07,880
Check that.

1412
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:09,880
The computer is hot, what's going on?

1413
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:39,880
I'll start handing out paper.

1414
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:54,880
My week was unemployed. I didn't sleep much of the week.

1415
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:59,880
One. No, I may have done two.

1416
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:03,880
I'm going to be doing a fuck-off show, though, on Tuesday night, I'm sure.

1417
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:05,880
Cool. Good job.

1418
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:07,880
Yeah, that's one reason you've got to listen to that Orange Launch Radio all the time.

1419
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:09,880
The Urban Monty Museum War Program.

1420
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:13,880
I got 19 listeners on a fuck-off show.

1421
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:15,880
Not bad. Not bad.

1422
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:17,880
That's more than we get on some of these shows.

1423
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:22,880
Yeah, and I had nine listeners at 7 a.m. one day.

1424
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:24,880
Which, for internet radio, is amazingly good.

1425
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:31,880
Because I did a fuck-off show from 11.30pm until 8 in the morning.

1426
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:34,880
So are we ever going to be featured on a satellite radio?

1427
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:38,880
I still say we need to get on G4. With some of the crap they have on there, Orange Lounge will fit right in.

1428
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:40,880
Alright, cool.

1429
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:46,880
Let's go to this week's Cage Max, shall we, ladies? I just called it Cage Max.

1430
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:48,880
Max Max Max Max Max!

1431
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:50,880
Help me.

1432
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:53,880
Okay, here we go with tonight's Cage Max.

1433
01:40:53,880 --> 01:41:04,880
Last week in the cage match, Loki won it with a song called Duck Toy by Hampenburg.

1434
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:07,880
And here is a clip of the way the cage match works.

1435
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:11,880
You can vote for either Loki's song, Dark Sakura's song, or my song.

1436
01:41:11,880 --> 01:41:16,880
And the winning song gets to go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.

1437
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:20,880
Except Duck Toy never went into rotation because they never got a copy of the MP3.

1438
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:29,880
Oh well. So, here it is, though, one more time for you. It could still win tonight if you want to vote for it. The first entry in tonight's cage match. Here's a clip of Hampenburg with Ducktoy.

1439
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:49,200
Alright, that was Hamptonburg with Ducktoy, that was last week's winner in Orange Lounge

1440
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:50,200
Radio's Cage Match.

1441
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:56,520
for that that's the first song or you can vote for my pick this week uh i promised irene like four

1442
01:42:56,520 --> 01:43:02,040
weeks ago i'd do this song and uh i didn't because i kept finding better stuff like freeze pop

1443
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:11,080
but i i you know what i'll put in superspro tonight i will don't push me all right

1444
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:16,040
no i want to do a different i want to do a different artist you should at least be happy

1445
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:17,040
You won that one.

1446
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:21,040
There's only because we got to go fight on air, but that was cool.

1447
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:50,000
They do still do stuff recently because I think this song was on the next best thing soundtrack

1448
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,600
That's where it came from. This song is called. It's a cover of an old 70 song and

1449
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:58,600
And it's called I'm Not In Love. So enjoy. This song is cool.

1450
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:37,600
I'm not in love, so don't forget it It's just a silly phase I'm going through

1451
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:50,600
I'm just a cop, I'll call you up Don't get me wrong, I think you got it next

1452
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:55,600
I'm not in love, no, no

1453
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:09,600
I'd like to see you back there

1454
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:15,600
It doesn't mean it means much to me

1455
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:29,600
So if I call you, I think I'll make it first Don't tell your friends about the two of us

1456
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:34,600
I'm not in love, not in love

1457
01:45:34,600 --> 01:46:03,600
I keep a picture of the one who had the best day

1458
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:06,600
I have to say, I'm not in it

1459
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:11,600
So don't trust me

1460
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:14,600
You can give it back

1461
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:17,600
I know the road doesn't mean

1462
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:20,600
That much to me

1463
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:44,120
Ooh, you wait a long time for me Ooh, you wait a long time

1464
01:46:44,120 --> 01:47:00,120
Ooh, you wait a long time for me Ooh, you wait a long time

1465
01:47:00,120 --> 01:47:07,120
I'm out of love, so don't forget it

1466
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:13,120
It's just a thing, don't you worry

1467
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:20,120
I'm just a card, I call you up

1468
01:47:20,120 --> 01:47:26,120
Don't get me wrong, think about it, babe

1469
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:28,120
I'm not in love

1470
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:33,120
If I'm not alive

1471
01:47:58,120 --> 01:48:27,800
Whoopies, oopies.

1472
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:31,200
I ended that one a little soon. That's alright. That was the end. Those last ten seconds of it.

1473
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:32,760
That was, uh...

1474
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:35,640
Olive with I'm...

1475
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:38,040
That was Olive with I'm not in love.

1476
01:48:38,040 --> 01:48:45,040
What did you kids think of that one?

1477
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:50,800
Give it a ten on principle.

1478
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:54,720
I was able to block out most of the song.

1479
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:59,420
it looks like

1480
01:48:59,420 --> 01:49:04,220
anyone

1481
01:49:04,220 --> 01:49:07,180
what was the title of that song i'm not in love

1482
01:49:07,180 --> 01:49:09,980
i'm not in love with that song

1483
01:49:09,980 --> 01:49:11,420
you're so punny

1484
01:49:11,420 --> 01:49:13,920
no i'm really not that was the worst song ever

1485
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:16,900
that was almost as bad as freeze pop

1486
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:18,700
i give it to you

1487
01:49:18,700 --> 01:49:20,060
sucks you bitch

1488
01:49:20,060 --> 01:49:24,260
it sucks you're never gonna like a song i put in cage match you could die yeah but i won

1489
01:49:24,260 --> 01:49:30,180
one for you, didn't I? Whatever. Okay, fine. You didn't win that week either. You lost,

1490
01:49:30,180 --> 01:49:37,180
if it wasn't for me and Kyle fighting. You suck. Tim, what did you think? One to ten

1491
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:44,780
scale. I don't like it that much. Okay. Well, what do you give it on a one to a ten? Will

1492
01:49:44,780 --> 01:50:03,780
It's a decent song, actually. Some might actually pick, but I'd have to say I'd give it probably

1493
01:50:03,780 --> 01:50:10,780
I give it a 9.9 because it's sexy but not as sexy as me.

1494
01:50:10,780 --> 01:50:17,780
I know who I am. Sorry, I should have said not as sexy as Dr. J.

1495
01:50:17,780 --> 01:50:20,780
Alright, one more pick.

1496
01:50:20,780 --> 01:50:27,780
I'm going to give it a 9.9 because it's sexy but not as sexy as me.

1497
01:50:27,780 --> 01:50:29,780
Okay, as I could have thought.

1498
01:50:37,780 --> 01:50:40,780
This was a song that I... I don't... I was like,

1499
01:50:40,780 --> 01:50:42,780
Oh my God, I need a song! I'll pick this one!

1500
01:50:43,780 --> 01:50:44,780
But I really like it.

1501
01:50:45,780 --> 01:50:46,780
What's it called?

1502
01:50:46,780 --> 01:50:49,780
Phantom of the Opera something or other remix. I don't know.

1503
01:50:49,780 --> 01:50:53,780
Alright, this is the Phantom of the Opera, something or other remix. Enjoy.

1504
01:51:49,780 --> 01:51:53,780
And speaks my name

1505
01:51:53,780 --> 01:51:57,780
And do I dream again?

1506
01:51:57,780 --> 01:52:01,780
For now I find

1507
01:52:01,780 --> 01:52:07,780
The future but the open heart is there

1508
01:52:37,780 --> 01:52:51,780
Those who have seen your face draw back to me

1509
01:52:51,780 --> 01:52:58,780
I am the mask you wear as you lay here

1510
01:52:58,780 --> 01:53:06,780
Your spirit and my wife in one collide

1511
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:13,780
The future will be over, understand

1512
01:53:13,780 --> 01:53:15,780
And each time you run away

1513
01:53:15,780 --> 01:53:21,780
The future will be over

1514
01:54:51,780 --> 01:55:13,180
Hi, we're back. That was the Phantom of the Opera techno remix. Going around the room,

1515
01:55:13,180 --> 01:55:14,180
what'd you think, Jamie?

1516
01:55:14,180 --> 01:55:20,580
Well, I could have found better if I had tried, so I'd give it an eight and a half.

1517
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:27,580
Okay, I absolutely love the Phantom of the Opera, but I really like the original a lot more than that.

1518
01:55:27,580 --> 01:55:35,580
And so, even though it's a good remix, uh, techno-mix of it, I'll give it like an 8, because it's still pretty decent, even though it could have been better.

1519
01:55:35,580 --> 01:55:37,580
You know.

1520
01:55:37,580 --> 01:55:42,580
Well, I'm going to give it this rating mostly because my other friend back in Fremont, and

1521
01:55:42,580 --> 01:55:49,580
I can't find him right now, he loves Phantom of the Opera, and I'd say he'd probably give

1522
01:55:49,580 --> 01:55:56,580
it a 10 if he heard it, or a 9 at the least. But just for me, I'll probably give it like

1523
01:55:56,580 --> 01:55:57,580
a 7.

1524
01:55:57,580 --> 01:55:59,580
Lowkey, what'd you think?

1525
01:55:59,580 --> 01:56:01,580
Logie, what did you think?

1526
01:56:01,580 --> 01:56:09,580
Uh, I heard this a long ass time ago, way before I started doing this show. That's how old it is.

1527
01:56:09,580 --> 01:56:11,580
Ooh, food!

1528
01:56:11,580 --> 01:56:12,580
You went to McDonald's instead?

1529
01:56:12,580 --> 01:56:14,580
Keep going, keep going, keep going.

1530
01:56:14,580 --> 01:56:19,580
Oh, I don't give a shit. If you got me the two cheeseburger meals supersized, I love you.

1531
01:56:19,580 --> 01:56:24,580
Order powder? Oh, still love you.

1532
01:56:24,580 --> 01:56:26,580
Okay, cage match, cage match.

1533
01:56:26,580 --> 01:56:45,580
Yeah, sorry. Anyways, the fact is, the song sounds like it came from a bargain CD that I'd find at Tower for five bucks. It was really cheesily done. It's got a good beat to it. I'll tell you what, vote for that song and not mine, because I have a better one next week anyways.

1534
01:56:45,580 --> 01:56:50,580
I give it an 8 but vote for Michael.

1535
01:57:15,580 --> 01:57:22,580
And don't vote for that one. Vote for someone else's. Vote for Rob's. You can vote for Olive with I'm Not in Love.

1536
01:57:22,580 --> 01:57:34,580
Phantom of the Opera – Techno Mix

1537
01:57:52,580 --> 01:57:57,580
There we go.

1538
01:57:57,580 --> 01:58:01,580
Much better clip. There you go. All right, so send in your votes now.

1539
01:58:01,580 --> 01:58:03,580
Be sure to let Rob win.

1540
01:58:03,580 --> 01:58:07,580
Or Jamie. Her pick is pretty good.

1541
01:58:07,580 --> 01:58:09,580
You've won, like, what? Won?

1542
01:58:09,580 --> 01:58:11,580
Yeah. You can vote for me even as a pity pick.

1543
01:58:11,580 --> 01:58:12,580
You deserve to win one.

1544
01:58:12,580 --> 01:58:14,580
All votes productively go to Rob.

1545
01:58:14,580 --> 01:58:16,580
I don't want that song to win.

1546
01:58:16,580 --> 01:58:19,580
All right. Usually we don't go to a musical break right after cage match,

1547
01:58:19,580 --> 01:58:22,260
cage match where there's a little chaotic because we just had food brought into the

1548
01:58:22,260 --> 01:58:26,540
room so people are scrounging for food. So we're going to take a quick quickie break

1549
01:58:26,540 --> 01:58:30,620
and we will be right back. And we're going to have tonight's list list when we get back.

1550
01:58:30,620 --> 01:58:38,120
So we're going to go to a song that I think Jamie likes a lot this week because you had

1551
01:58:38,120 --> 01:58:42,780
a good accomplishment with this song this week. Okay, we're going to hear the long version

1552
01:58:42,780 --> 01:58:49,780
the last message and we'll be right back.

1553
01:59:12,780 --> 01:59:14,780
How I'm feeling

1554
01:59:14,780 --> 01:59:17,780
My hustle's around with no place

1555
01:59:17,780 --> 01:59:20,780
Hang on the ceiling, stop me

1556
01:59:20,780 --> 01:59:23,780
Hang on the shuttles, no more dealing

1557
01:59:23,780 --> 01:59:27,780
It's time to say goodbye, goodbye, baby

1558
01:59:27,780 --> 01:59:29,780
I want you to know

1559
01:59:29,780 --> 01:59:32,780
I'm ready to be happy

1560
01:59:32,780 --> 01:59:35,780
It's more time for me to say

1561
01:59:35,780 --> 01:59:38,780
Baby, that's it for you

1562
01:59:38,780 --> 01:59:40,780
You don't have to love me again

1563
01:59:40,780 --> 01:59:42,780
It's only too bad

1564
01:59:42,780 --> 01:59:44,780
That's it for you

1565
01:59:44,780 --> 01:59:46,780
I can take you over

1566
01:59:46,780 --> 01:59:48,780
I don't need you anymore

1567
01:59:54,780 --> 01:59:57,780
That's right, that's right for you

1568
01:59:57,780 --> 02:00:04,780
I'm feeling, you should've seen that me inside

1569
02:00:04,780 --> 02:00:11,780
I don't need an eye, but you must believe that I

1570
02:00:11,780 --> 02:00:18,780
I'm living in your reality, I'm the loser

1571
02:00:48,780 --> 02:00:53,780
Who are you? So I can make you go where I don't want to go anymore

1572
02:01:18,780 --> 02:01:27,780
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry for you

1573
02:01:27,780 --> 02:01:35,780
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry for you

1574
02:02:05,780 --> 02:02:11,780
With respect to the moon, I'm thinking of you, love

1575
02:02:11,780 --> 02:02:16,780
Half a mile away, no matter where you may be

1576
02:02:16,780 --> 02:02:20,780
My thoughts will travel to you

1577
02:02:20,780 --> 02:02:26,780
Cause I think my message will come back on the moon

1578
02:02:26,780 --> 02:02:30,780
Please give my stories to my love

1579
02:02:30,780 --> 02:02:33,180
Mr. Luke, I love him so

1580
02:02:33,180 --> 02:02:36,980
He's showing a change just to find out

1581
02:02:36,980 --> 02:02:40,180
Mr. Luke, I love him so

1582
02:02:40,180 --> 02:02:43,380
Now that we're through, baby

1583
02:02:43,380 --> 02:02:45,780
I've got the moonlight skies

1584
02:02:45,780 --> 02:02:51,980
Welcome to you

1585
02:02:51,980 --> 02:02:58,580
Welcome with you

1586
02:02:58,580 --> 02:03:05,580
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

1587
02:03:20,580 --> 02:03:25,580
Extreme Bimani Radio. That's us. Orange Lounge Radio.

1588
02:03:25,580 --> 02:03:31,340
We are back ladies and gentlemen, and I have tonight's winner of the cage match

1589
02:03:32,660 --> 02:03:34,380
and

1590
02:03:34,380 --> 02:03:36,060
by an amazing

1591
02:03:36,060 --> 02:03:38,060
one vote

1592
02:03:38,060 --> 02:03:43,380
One vote margin made this song win tonight's cage match winner is

1593
02:03:47,540 --> 02:03:49,460
That's the way

1594
02:03:49,460 --> 02:03:54,180
By why I tell you not to you do you bastard. That's it

1595
02:03:54,180 --> 02:03:56,180
You're on the list!

1596
02:03:56,180 --> 02:04:00,180
By one vote over Phantom of the Opera. One vote.

1597
02:04:00,180 --> 02:04:01,180
Doesn't that mean Rob wins?

1598
02:04:01,180 --> 02:04:04,180
If the one person who voted for Olive would have voted the other way around.

1599
02:04:04,180 --> 02:04:06,180
I know! Only one person!

1600
02:04:06,180 --> 02:04:08,180
Only one person voted for Olive.

1601
02:04:08,180 --> 02:04:12,180
You're not speaking to English! I said don't vote for the damn song!

1602
02:04:12,180 --> 02:04:14,180
Because that's something better next week.

1603
02:04:14,180 --> 02:04:18,180
Which is funny because I could swear that the one person who voted for my song

1604
02:04:18,180 --> 02:04:21,180
was also the one person who was hating on it in the chat room.

1605
02:04:21,180 --> 02:04:23,180
Rob wins.

1606
02:04:25,180 --> 02:04:28,180
So, Loki, congratulations, you win once again.

1607
02:04:28,180 --> 02:04:33,180
However, I guess since Jamie did this a few weeks back, we will extend the same offer to you.

1608
02:04:33,180 --> 02:04:38,180
You can pull the song Voluntary out next week and put in your own new song.

1609
02:04:38,180 --> 02:04:40,180
Because we let Jamie do that with the Zelda thing, right?

1610
02:04:40,180 --> 02:04:42,180
So, only to be fair.

1611
02:04:42,180 --> 02:04:45,180
Now, I have, um, this is my new project thing I want to...

1612
02:04:45,180 --> 02:04:48,180
I say, us as Americans should push this.

1613
02:04:48,180 --> 02:04:55,540
this. Get rid of reality TV and instead put Japanese game shows. Why? Why? The greatest

1614
02:04:55,540 --> 02:05:01,080
thing has happened yesterday, okay? TNN has brought this new show. Well, it's kind of

1615
02:05:01,080 --> 02:05:06,060
an old Japanese TV show where they basically torture these people. Anyways, and they make

1616
02:05:06,060 --> 02:05:10,760
them do ridiculous challenges. And the show is called Most Extreme Elimination Challenge.

1617
02:05:10,760 --> 02:05:15,680
It's the greatest show ever and because it's all in Japanese, they have these people dubbing

1618
02:05:15,680 --> 02:05:21,100
over the voices and making them sound really goofy and stupid. And it's that much better.

1619
02:05:21,100 --> 02:05:26,620
Is the greatest show on earth. I... It would beat out any reality show. Fuck that. This

1620
02:05:26,620 --> 02:05:32,980
is the best shit ever, okay? This is the best fucking... This is what game shows should

1621
02:05:32,980 --> 02:05:39,660
aspire to be, okay? I mean, Price is Right is good, but nowhere... It does not come anywhere

1622
02:05:39,660 --> 02:05:46,060
near this damn show. Best show ever. Speaking of reality shows, did you, uh, see any previews

1623
02:05:46,060 --> 02:05:53,060
lately for that new Spring Break reality movie that's coming out? I already fucking talked

1624
02:05:53,060 --> 02:05:58,420
about that. Okay, that fucking black guy in his fucking speedo, he can die. Yeah, this

1625
02:05:58,420 --> 02:06:04,100
is a great idea. Let's take non-actors, give them no script, and just have them go wild

1626
02:06:04,100 --> 02:06:08,780
on Spring Break, and we'll film it and call it a movie. Fuck that. I can go around yelling

1627
02:06:08,780 --> 02:06:13,780
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Speaking of reality TV, I watched something that Islander had.

1628
02:06:13,780 --> 02:06:18,780
The Blind Date DVD. The Uncensored Blind Date DVD.

1629
02:06:18,780 --> 02:06:21,780
A really blind date. I've already seen that really blind date.

1630
02:06:21,780 --> 02:06:28,780
Well, this one was great. I mean, besides, though, all the boobs and cock there was all over the place.

1631
02:06:28,780 --> 02:06:35,780
They showed this one person who, like, by the end of the day, they were, like, already all over each other the whole date. It was funny.

1632
02:06:35,780 --> 02:06:41,780
They just met the first time. Yeah, she unbuttoned her sweater.

1633
02:06:41,780 --> 02:06:43,780
It was just like...

1634
02:06:43,780 --> 02:06:47,780
I was like, these are your first dates. What's wrong with these stupid people?

1635
02:06:47,780 --> 02:06:51,780
By the way, boys and girls, Orange Lounge the motion picture comes out at the end of the year.

1636
02:06:51,780 --> 02:06:53,780
No, it doesn't.

1637
02:06:53,780 --> 02:06:55,780
And that's all it is, is a moving picture.

1638
02:06:55,780 --> 02:06:57,780
Yeah, it comes out and then it goes back in.

1639
02:06:57,780 --> 02:07:00,780
Stupid MTV with their stupid reality shows.

1640
02:07:00,780 --> 02:07:02,780
Fraternity Life is...

1641
02:07:02,780 --> 02:07:12,780
Okay, fraternity life and sorority life are being filmed at the same time, you know, one falls obviously, the sorority, and the other one the fraternity, and their rival, you know, fraternity-sorority things.

1642
02:07:12,780 --> 02:07:16,780
Biggest bunch of repressed homosexuals I've ever seen on television.

1643
02:07:16,780 --> 02:07:21,780
Yeah, okay, so that show's really stupid. Fucking girls, like, totally schooled these guys.

1644
02:07:21,780 --> 02:07:23,780
sorority life

1645
02:07:51,780 --> 02:07:58,280
They're gonna have these girls sign this t-shirt for no reason whatsoever, and like, write that, like, you know, this fraternity sucks or some shit.

1646
02:07:58,280 --> 02:08:01,780
And I mean, come on, if you're, if this, like, you know, fraternity comes up to you,

1647
02:08:01,780 --> 02:08:05,780
Can you sign my shirt? You gotta be a little suspicious to what's going on there.

1648
02:08:05,780 --> 02:08:14,780
Especially, it's like, so then they end up stealing the shirt, and then making them come over and clean their house, and then fuck up their house too, and I laugh at them, because they suck.

1649
02:08:14,780 --> 02:08:23,900
What do they do? I ask for a big and tasty with no meat. I got a piece of bread, some

1650
02:08:23,900 --> 02:08:31,540
onions and a tomato. Beautiful. You know why? You need to go to BK because they have the

1651
02:08:31,540 --> 02:08:36,500
veggie burger there, which is pretty decent. We need to do listless. Yes, we do need to

1652
02:08:36,500 --> 02:08:39,820
do listless. There was one other thing I was thinking of that I wanted to bring up before...

1653
02:08:39,820 --> 02:08:44,220
But you forgot, so let's do listless. Alright, but I forgot, so let's do listless. Yay, a

1654
02:08:44,220 --> 02:08:51,220
We don't have official theme music for Whistlers, I just realized. We don't really have any theme music. Do we want some theme music for Whistlers?

1655
02:08:51,220 --> 02:08:53,220
Um...yeah, man.

1656
02:08:53,220 --> 02:08:55,220
Sure.

1657
02:08:55,220 --> 02:08:58,220
Uh...let's see.

1658
02:08:58,220 --> 02:09:02,220
Uh...okay.

1659
02:09:02,220 --> 02:09:04,220
Alright guys, it's time for...

1660
02:09:04,220 --> 02:09:11,220
It is time, once again, for Orange Lounge Radio's Listless!

1661
02:09:28,180 --> 02:09:32,100
It's inspired by an old television show that used to be on VH1.

1662
02:09:32,100 --> 02:09:34,100
Stolen from, but inspired by.

1663
02:09:35,100 --> 02:09:37,100
Alright, tonight's topic...

1664
02:09:40,100 --> 02:09:42,100
Jamie is here to explain tonight's topic.

1665
02:09:42,100 --> 02:09:43,100
I am? Oh.

1666
02:09:43,100 --> 02:09:44,100
Yes.

1667
02:09:44,100 --> 02:09:46,100
Tonight's topic is Chicken McNugget.

1668
02:09:47,100 --> 02:09:48,100
No.

1669
02:09:49,100 --> 02:09:52,100
This, again, is back on the Kingdom Hearts theme.

1670
02:09:52,100 --> 02:09:59,100
It is what world that is associated with Disney, Miramax, Anix, or Square?

1671
02:09:59,100 --> 02:10:00,100
ABC.

1672
02:10:00,100 --> 02:10:03,100
Anix.

1673
02:10:03,100 --> 02:10:05,100
Aenis.

1674
02:10:05,100 --> 02:10:06,100
Squeenix.

1675
02:10:06,100 --> 02:10:09,100
Squeenix, yep, Squeenix.

1676
02:10:09,100 --> 02:10:13,100
Or for Loki, Squeenis.

1677
02:10:13,100 --> 02:10:16,100
Would you like to see in the next Kingdom Hearts game?

1678
02:10:16,100 --> 02:10:37,100
What world would you like to see in the new Kingdom Hearts game?

1679
02:10:37,100 --> 02:10:41,100
Alright, here we go. Who's participating? Show of hands.

1680
02:10:41,100 --> 02:10:45,320
This this whole thing you guys are at McDonald's sorry, okay, Jamie's first. Yes, Jamie

1681
02:10:54,720 --> 02:11:01,160
All right, so Jamie says corner trigger chrono trust a particular reason any you want to say anything reasons why

1682
02:11:01,160 --> 02:11:07,160
First of all, I think Michelle would kill me, because there needs to be a Dark Surge as a bad guy.

1683
02:11:07,160 --> 02:11:15,160
And that, and I want, um, I want, um, Magus, and I want to play the game and have Magus be in my party.

1684
02:11:15,160 --> 02:11:16,160
Okay.

1685
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:21,160
Because I couldn't ever bring myself to defeat him in battle, because I wanted him in my party.

1686
02:11:21,160 --> 02:11:25,160
And I wanted to kick everybody's ass with that Dark Zone spell he has.

1687
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:26,160
Alright.

1688
02:11:26,160 --> 02:11:27,160
Yeah.

1689
02:11:27,160 --> 02:11:28,160
Okay.

1690
02:11:28,160 --> 02:11:30,160
And it was the hair, you know, the hair.

1691
02:11:30,160 --> 02:11:35,160
Fair enough, good reasons. Zero, what world would you most like to see in the next Kingdom Hearts?

1692
02:11:35,160 --> 02:11:37,160
It would be funny to see Chasing Daisy.

1693
02:11:37,160 --> 02:11:39,160
Chasing Daisy?

1694
02:11:42,160 --> 02:11:46,160
I know, but if you wanted to mix it, it would be Chasing Amy, but you'd just call it Chasing Daisy.

1695
02:11:46,160 --> 02:11:50,160
Any particular reason why we want this Chasing Amy slash Chasing Daisy thing?

1696
02:11:50,160 --> 02:11:54,160
It would be funny to see Mickey, Donald, and Goofy going after a lesbian.

1697
02:11:54,160 --> 02:11:56,160
You just want Daisy Duck to be a dyke.

1698
02:11:56,160 --> 02:11:58,160
Cause she'll want Biddy.

1699
02:11:58,160 --> 02:12:04,000
Dude, this burger's rare. What's a Nubian? Look at this. The burger is pink. Shut the

1700
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:11,000
fuck up. The burger's raw. I'm gonna eat it and get poisoned. Is Jim? What was your online

1701
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:15,040
name again? I'm sorry. Uh, Guice. That's not my online name. It's just kind of a handle

1702
02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:22,040
of mine. Guys. Okay, Guice. Um, uh, kind of serious. Uh, in the style of Final Fighting

1703
02:12:22,040 --> 02:12:26,040
Final Fighting Fantasy, actually.

1704
02:12:26,040 --> 02:12:27,040
Any Final Fantasy?

1705
02:12:27,040 --> 02:12:30,040
No, Final Fighting Fantasy, in Flash.

1706
02:12:30,040 --> 02:12:35,040
Ah, okay.

1707
02:12:35,040 --> 02:12:37,040
Final Fighting Fantasy.

1708
02:12:37,040 --> 02:12:41,040
For those of you who don't know what Final Fighting Fantasy is,

1709
02:12:41,040 --> 02:12:44,040
it's basically just a combination of all the Final Fantasy worlds

1710
02:12:44,040 --> 02:12:47,040
with basically all the storylines intact.

1711
02:12:47,040 --> 02:12:50,040
Like, whatever characters died in the games are still dead

1712
02:12:50,040 --> 02:12:52,040
and various other things like that.

1713
02:12:52,040 --> 02:12:59,040
First of all, they already have seven and eight and ten involved in Kingdom Hearts already.

1714
02:12:59,040 --> 02:13:01,040
Well, you can combine the others.

1715
02:13:01,040 --> 02:13:06,040
No, but we're actually picking established individual worlds.

1716
02:13:06,040 --> 02:13:11,040
Well, basically involving one, two, three, four, five, and six as well.

1717
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:17,040
Well, that's the thing with this thing. It's like a saga created to combine all those worlds into one.

1718
02:13:17,040 --> 02:13:19,040
Does it exist as a real square?

1719
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:20,040
Huh?

1720
02:13:20,040 --> 02:13:21,040
I mean...

1721
02:13:21,040 --> 02:13:25,040
Well, it's based off of square characters, though, so...

1722
02:13:25,040 --> 02:13:27,040
All right.

1723
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:30,040
Final Fighting Fantasy.

1724
02:13:30,040 --> 02:13:31,040
All right.

1725
02:13:31,040 --> 02:13:33,040
Final Fighting Fantasy is the bomb, yo!

1726
02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:36,040
All right, for those who may not have heard of it, there's your explanation.

1727
02:13:36,040 --> 02:13:37,040
Let's go on.

1728
02:13:37,040 --> 02:13:39,040
Logie, your number three pick.

1729
02:13:39,040 --> 02:13:44,040
I'm gonna rain on someone's parade here, but Xenogears or Xenosaga...

1730
02:13:44,040 --> 02:13:47,040
Xeno... Xenogears or Xenosaga? You gotta pick one.

1731
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:50,040
Xenogears is fucking... Well, Xenogears is only...

1732
02:13:50,040 --> 02:13:52,040
It's the same fucking universe.

1733
02:13:52,040 --> 02:13:53,040
Alright.

1734
02:13:56,040 --> 02:13:58,040
Uh, any other particular reason why?

1735
02:14:00,040 --> 02:14:06,040
Because that game rocks. It has giant robots to smash down Mickey because he sucks and he's gay.

1736
02:14:06,040 --> 02:14:09,040
Alright, Irene. Your pick.

1737
02:14:09,040 --> 02:14:15,040
Well, I'm incorporating both Anita and Jason's picks, so our number three is Star Ocean.

1738
02:14:15,040 --> 02:14:16,040
Star Ocean.

1739
02:14:16,040 --> 02:14:23,040
Yeah, I've never played it, but they said it, so I don't know.

1740
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:28,040
Alright, since we can pick anything, you know, Miramax, any of that, because they all are

1741
02:14:28,040 --> 02:14:31,040
owned by the same group, my number three was Pulp Fiction Land.

1742
02:14:31,040 --> 02:14:33,040
That would be funny.

1743
02:14:33,040 --> 02:14:35,040
That would be funny.

1744
02:14:36,040 --> 02:14:39,040
Here's the Keyblade. I had it up my ass.

1745
02:14:41,040 --> 02:14:45,040
Give me back my Keyblade. Which Keyblade is it? Everyone says bad motherfucker on it.

1746
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:51,040
Lord will strike down upon thee with great vengeance. Alright.

1747
02:14:51,040 --> 02:14:54,040
They don't call it a Keyblade. Here, you know what they call it?

1748
02:14:55,040 --> 02:14:56,040
Alright.

1749
02:14:56,040 --> 02:14:58,040
The Blade Royale.

1750
02:14:58,040 --> 02:14:59,040
With cheese.

1751
02:14:59,040 --> 02:15:00,040
The Battle Royale.

1752
02:15:00,040 --> 02:15:02,040
The Battle Royale.

1753
02:15:02,040 --> 02:15:04,040
Yes, Jamie, your number two pick?

1754
02:15:04,040 --> 02:15:07,040
My number two pick is Bust-A-Move and Bust-A-Move 2.

1755
02:15:08,040 --> 02:15:11,040
Cause I want heat in my party.

1756
02:15:12,040 --> 02:15:13,040
To dance.

1757
02:15:13,040 --> 02:15:15,040
And set people on fire.

1758
02:15:15,040 --> 02:15:16,040
Alright.

1759
02:15:16,040 --> 02:15:19,040
So you want Bust-A-Move so you can have heat lay down the wall.

1760
02:15:19,040 --> 02:15:22,040
And no I'm not talking about Puzzle Bobble.

1761
02:15:23,040 --> 02:15:26,040
And the name Bust-A-Groove is not really a name.

1762
02:15:26,040 --> 02:15:30,040
It's what the 989 Studios has duped you into thinking it is.

1763
02:15:30,040 --> 02:15:44,040
I think it would be cool to see all the characters from Kingdom Hearts have an air-guys type fighting game.

1764
02:16:00,040 --> 02:16:04,040
Alright, Jim. Your number two pick.

1765
02:16:04,040 --> 02:16:09,040
My number two pick would have to be the best thing to come out of Disney, Gargoyles.

1766
02:16:09,040 --> 02:16:16,040
Gargoyles. Very good. Alright.

1767
02:16:16,040 --> 02:16:23,040
I remember the old Gargoyles quest games on Game... Actually, I don't think they had anything... Did they have anything to do with the series? No, they weren't related, were they?

1768
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:26,040
Alright, Gargoyles. That's a good one. Alright.

1769
02:16:26,040 --> 02:16:33,200
Loki you're number two pick the best fucking game for Squaresoft. Well, yeah what you the artists formerly known as Squaresoft

1770
02:16:34,920 --> 02:16:36,920
Fergots are not

1771
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:41,040
No, wrong game wrong game. It gives Anita einhänder

1772
02:16:42,240 --> 02:16:46,960
What one what one einhänder einhänder einhänder

1773
02:16:47,360 --> 02:16:49,360
meaning one hander

1774
02:16:49,680 --> 02:16:51,680
H A N D E R

1775
02:16:52,520 --> 02:16:54,360
It's a shooter

1776
02:16:54,360 --> 02:17:15,080
I don't even think this is related to Square or Disney or Miramax or anything, but I put

1777
02:17:15,080 --> 02:17:16,080
Reading Rainbow!

1778
02:17:16,080 --> 02:17:17,080
Reading Rainbow!

1779
02:17:17,080 --> 02:17:24,000
Reading Rainbow World would be so awesome.

1780
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,280
Reading Rainbow is done by LeVar Burton, right?

1781
02:17:26,280 --> 02:17:27,280
Yes, LeVar Burton.

1782
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:30,760
LeVar Burton is on Star Trek The Next Generation.

1783
02:17:30,760 --> 02:17:33,400
Star Trek The Next Generation was sponsored by...

1784
02:17:33,400 --> 02:17:36,680
Give me a help, Slayer.

1785
02:17:36,680 --> 02:17:39,100
Okay, I'm trying to...

1786
02:17:39,100 --> 02:17:40,880
Would he join your party at that point?

1787
02:17:40,880 --> 02:17:41,880
2 plus 2 is 4.

1788
02:17:41,880 --> 02:17:42,880
4 times 3 is 12.

1789
02:17:42,880 --> 02:17:43,880
There are 12 inches in a ruler.

1790
02:17:43,880 --> 02:17:47,880
Queen Elizabeth was a ruler, and so on and so forth.

1791
02:17:47,880 --> 02:17:49,880
Yeah, anyway, so vote for Reading Rainbow.

1792
02:17:49,880 --> 02:17:52,880
It says it was eel sex.

1793
02:17:52,880 --> 02:17:54,880
Ah!

1794
02:17:54,880 --> 02:17:55,880
Reading Rainbow.

1795
02:17:55,880 --> 02:17:56,880
I used to have the theme song.

1796
02:17:56,880 --> 02:17:57,880
I can't find it anymore.

1797
02:17:57,880 --> 02:17:58,880
Oh, well.

1798
02:17:58,880 --> 02:18:00,880
Butterfly in the sky.

1799
02:18:03,880 --> 02:18:06,880
All right, anyway, my number two pick.

1800
02:18:06,880 --> 02:18:09,880
Now, this is stretching it.

1801
02:18:09,880 --> 02:18:11,880
I'm really stretching it here.

1802
02:18:11,880 --> 02:18:21,880
Okay, so we looped it to Disney. Well, Disney not only owns Miramax, but they also own Touchstone Pictures, which put out a movie, Romeo and Michelle.

1803
02:18:21,880 --> 02:18:28,880
So I said they need to be Romeo and Michelleville, because it would be 80s nostalgia galore.

1804
02:18:28,880 --> 02:18:33,880
Oh, yeah? F you.

1805
02:18:33,880 --> 02:18:36,880
Alright, my number one.

1806
02:18:36,880 --> 02:18:38,880
Yes, your number one, Jamie.

1807
02:18:38,880 --> 02:18:44,880
Because Disney now owns the rights to the dub version of Digimon, so that's my pick.

1808
02:18:44,880 --> 02:18:46,880
Digimon.

1809
02:18:46,880 --> 02:18:47,880
Because Pokemon sucks ass.

1810
02:18:47,880 --> 02:18:50,880
Yeah, I just saw Pokemon 4 this week. It was cool.

1811
02:18:50,880 --> 02:18:52,880
And Pokemon 5's coming out soon.

1812
02:18:52,880 --> 02:18:58,880
Okay, first of all, if you watch Digimon in Japanese, it doesn't suck. I do agree, the dub is sort of ass.

1813
02:19:03,880 --> 02:19:05,880
Zero, your number one pick.

1814
02:19:05,880 --> 02:19:11,380
Okay, I had a tough time choosing between because but since you know Disney owns ABC because you know

1815
02:19:11,380 --> 02:19:13,940
They're trying to be the Microsoft or television now. I

1816
02:19:14,620 --> 02:19:17,820
Had to choose it would either be the Drew Carey show or whose line is it anyway?

1817
02:19:17,820 --> 02:19:22,720
Because that would be hella funny. That would be funny. You have to like improv to make everyone laugh

1818
02:19:22,720 --> 02:19:27,720
Is that your number one pick? Son of a bitch, you took mine.

1819
02:19:27,720 --> 02:19:36,720
I just want to say for those who had their picks taken by somebody else, great minds think alike.

1820
02:19:36,720 --> 02:19:40,720
I'm not getting you in the mic. Make sure it's on over there.

1821
02:19:40,720 --> 02:19:41,720
Hello?

1822
02:19:41,720 --> 02:19:44,720
Oh, there we go. Okay, it's back. Oh, whatever. That was weird.

1823
02:19:44,720 --> 02:19:58,720
My number one pick would have to be, excluding those underdeveloped characters, unless there are some pedophiles in the audience, would have to be a Final Fantasy nudist colony.

1824
02:19:58,720 --> 02:20:02,720
A Final Fantasy nudist colony.

1825
02:20:02,720 --> 02:20:04,720
It's something anybody can like.

1826
02:20:04,720 --> 02:20:09,720
Well, we had to get porn in the show somehow.

1827
02:20:09,720 --> 02:20:11,720
Alright.

1828
02:20:11,720 --> 02:20:13,720
Number one.

1829
02:20:13,720 --> 02:20:21,560
All right number one from Loki, okay, right second, okay, it's gonna be

1830
02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:28,800
Horrible theme park ride turned into movie Ville

1831
02:20:33,800 --> 02:20:40,000
Horrible horrible theme park attraction turned into movie Ville because parts of the Caribbean you're in a mansion

1832
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:41,000
mention

1833
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:42,320
the country bears

1834
02:20:42,320 --> 02:20:44,720
that has nothing to do with the subject of the

1835
02:20:44,720 --> 02:20:46,040
keys match

1836
02:20:46,040 --> 02:20:46,560
that

1837
02:20:46,560 --> 02:20:49,720
parts of the caribbean's being made of

1838
02:20:49,720 --> 02:20:52,280
you gotta pick what's over parts of the caribbean

1839
02:20:52,280 --> 02:20:54,600
fine i'll pick a god damn universe then

1840
02:20:54,600 --> 02:20:55,760
alright you know

1841
02:20:55,760 --> 02:20:57,520
let's see here uh...

1842
02:20:57,520 --> 02:21:00,080
we pull it out of my ass here uh...

1843
02:21:00,080 --> 02:21:02,720
we're gonna pick they're gonna go to bears

1844
02:21:02,720 --> 02:21:03,680
no

1845
02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:05,840
they're gonna go to uh...

1846
02:21:05,840 --> 02:21:09,360
i don't know let's see how about halloweenville because you know

1847
02:21:09,360 --> 02:21:10,640
Halloween...

1848
02:21:10,640 --> 02:21:13,120
Halloweenville's in the game, and Kingdom Hearts 1.

1849
02:21:13,120 --> 02:21:16,240
HOLLOWEITHAFUCKINGMOVIEVILL, GODDAMMIT, YOU KNOW?

1850
02:21:16,240 --> 02:21:21,480
Alright, alright, alright.

1851
02:21:21,480 --> 02:21:23,600
Yeah, it is Miramax.

1852
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:25,520
Okay, if you would...

1853
02:21:25,520 --> 02:21:26,680
Alright.

1854
02:21:26,680 --> 02:21:31,000
This is Dchild, and since I'm not part of this list list, I'm just throwing one out there,

1855
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,120
because I have to get this out. Alright.

1856
02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:38,040
Because Kevin Smith was a whore for Miramax, I'd have to say the Quick Stop,

1857
02:21:38,040 --> 02:21:41,960
Along with Jay and Simon, Bob, you must have them.

1858
02:21:41,960 --> 02:21:44,420
Yeah, I was going to say, they already have it.

1859
02:21:44,420 --> 02:21:47,640
Everybody else is going to see that, so it's exciting.

1860
02:21:47,640 --> 02:21:48,720
All right, the quick stop.

1861
02:21:48,720 --> 02:21:50,600
All right, Irene, what's your guys' number one?

1862
02:21:50,600 --> 02:21:52,800
OK, this is that Anita's suggestion.

1863
02:21:52,800 --> 02:21:53,920
Is it on?

1864
02:21:53,920 --> 02:21:55,240
Yeah, OK.

1865
02:21:55,240 --> 02:21:58,360
She suggested Spirited Awayville, or town,

1866
02:21:58,360 --> 02:21:59,400
or something.

1867
02:21:59,400 --> 02:22:00,400
It's a ghost.

1868
02:22:00,400 --> 02:22:02,640
Because, yes, because I love Spirited Away.

1869
02:22:02,640 --> 02:22:03,400
That's a good one.

1870
02:22:03,400 --> 02:22:04,680
Spirited Away was a great film.

1871
02:22:04,680 --> 02:22:06,920
So Spirited Away the Land, or whatever.

1872
02:22:06,920 --> 02:22:10,920
My number one was Whose Line Is It Anyway, but it got taken, bastard.

1873
02:22:10,920 --> 02:22:18,920
So I'm gonna change, I'm gonna do a ride as well, because the whole discussion about the ride got me thinking, and I would love to see a spinning teacup slam.

1874
02:22:24,920 --> 02:22:28,920
Where you just spin round and round and you're in a giant teacup.

1875
02:22:29,920 --> 02:22:34,920
Yeah, and then everybody vomits all over and it's just a big green pile of shit.

1876
02:22:34,920 --> 02:22:37,920
You didn't do the faulty gondola ride, Ville.

1877
02:22:38,920 --> 02:22:45,920
Alright, now is the part where we have to say goodbye to something that's on the list. Here we go, Jamie.

1878
02:22:45,920 --> 02:22:50,920
There's a lot of these that I would take off the list because they have absolutely nothing to do with the subject of the list list, however...

1879
02:22:50,920 --> 02:22:53,920
Yeah, you put urgent! Ein, hein, ein. Someone said urgent?

1880
02:22:53,920 --> 02:22:54,920
Yeah, someone said urgent.

1881
02:22:54,920 --> 02:22:56,920
And it's its own universe.

1882
02:22:57,920 --> 02:22:58,920
Alright, alright.

1883
02:22:58,920 --> 02:23:05,920
So, I'm gonna take off Final Fighting Fantasy because that's involving multiple universes, so it's trying to combine multiple things in one, so it's cheating.

1884
02:23:05,920 --> 02:23:08,920
Alright, so Final Fighting Fantasy. Alright, he's off.

1885
02:23:08,920 --> 02:23:15,920
If it isn't Final Fantasy VI or Final Fantasy V, I would have agreed with it. However, that's sort of cheating to take multiple answers in one.

1886
02:23:15,920 --> 02:23:18,920
Alright, so on to technicality. There it goes. Alright, zero.

1887
02:23:18,920 --> 02:23:20,920
She's gonna end up punching someone over him or something.

1888
02:23:20,920 --> 02:23:25,920
No, I would take out probably the Final Fantasy nudist colony, because I don't think it would be...

1889
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:29,920
You could, like, look on the internet for that! You could look on the internet for that!

1890
02:23:29,920 --> 02:23:31,920
Alright, get on the internet if you want to see some nudie.

1891
02:23:31,920 --> 02:23:34,920
Because we know Cloud's in the gay porn, so, uh, yeah.

1892
02:23:34,920 --> 02:23:38,920
Alright, I don't know if you can see the list all the way back there, Jim, but is there something on here? It's gotta go.

1893
02:23:38,920 --> 02:23:58,920
Oh, I'm sorry. Since I wasn't that big of a fan of it, I'd have to say Romy and Michelleville.

1894
02:23:58,920 --> 02:24:01,920
Aw, make me cry.

1895
02:24:01,920 --> 02:24:05,920
This is the dial tone.

1896
02:24:05,920 --> 02:24:07,920
Wokey.

1897
02:24:07,920 --> 02:24:09,920
Uh...

1898
02:24:09,920 --> 02:24:11,920
We're gonna take off...

1899
02:24:11,920 --> 02:24:13,920
Um...

1900
02:24:13,920 --> 02:24:15,920
Chasing Daisy.

1901
02:24:15,920 --> 02:24:17,920
Chasing Daisy.

1902
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:19,920
You do have- the quickstop's a little better.

1903
02:24:19,920 --> 02:24:21,920
Yeah, quickstop's a little better.

1904
02:24:21,920 --> 02:24:23,920
Alright. I agree.

1905
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:25,920
Irene, what's coming down?

1906
02:24:25,920 --> 02:24:27,920
Um...

1907
02:24:27,920 --> 02:24:29,920
I...

1908
02:24:29,920 --> 02:24:31,920
Shit. Um...

1909
02:24:31,920 --> 02:24:38,920
I think I'm going to take off the spinning teacups because it's kind of lame.

1910
02:24:38,920 --> 02:24:39,920
You suck.

1911
02:24:39,920 --> 02:24:40,920
Yeah.

1912
02:24:40,920 --> 02:24:41,920
Haha.

1913
02:24:41,920 --> 02:24:42,920
All my picks are going.

1914
02:24:42,920 --> 02:24:43,920
Okay, so yeah.

1915
02:24:43,920 --> 02:24:44,920
Makes me sad.

1916
02:24:44,920 --> 02:24:49,720
All right, then that leaves me.

1917
02:24:49,720 --> 02:24:56,920
As tempting as I am to take off Chrono Trigger, because everybody knows I think it's overrated,

1918
02:24:56,920 --> 02:25:00,160
but no, I'm going to keep it on there because I'd get killed by so many people if I did

1919
02:25:00,160 --> 02:25:01,160
take that off.

1920
02:25:01,160 --> 02:25:13,160
So... I don't know. I guess I have to take off Halloween, Michael Myers, because they already did the Nightmare Before Christmas land.

1921
02:25:13,160 --> 02:25:18,160
Hellraiser I would have let you keep, but...

1922
02:25:18,160 --> 02:25:25,160
Alright, so now you can vote for one of these lands that should be in the next Kingdom Hearts game.

1923
02:25:25,160 --> 02:25:29,160
So here they are, they're in the chatroom, and Jamie's going to read them off for you.

1924
02:25:29,160 --> 02:25:50,160
We have Chrono Trigger Chrono Cross, we have Xenogear Xenosaga, Star Ocean, Pulp Fiction Land, Bust and Move World, Air Guys, Gargoyles, Einhonder, Reading Rainbow, Digimon, Whose Line is it Anyway?, Quick Stop, and Spirited Away. Vote!

1925
02:25:50,160 --> 02:25:54,160
You can send those votes right now over a private message to me.

1926
02:25:54,160 --> 02:25:55,160
And you can send your complaints...

1927
02:25:55,160 --> 02:25:57,160
Skye.

1928
02:25:57,160 --> 02:26:01,160
In the chat room.

1929
02:26:01,160 --> 02:26:02,160
All right.

1930
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:04,160
While you guys vote, we're going to take a quick break.

1931
02:26:04,160 --> 02:26:07,160
And we're going to come back and just talk about...

1932
02:26:07,160 --> 02:26:09,160
Are you ready to do a game review this week?

1933
02:26:09,160 --> 02:26:11,160
I actually have a couple ideas.

1934
02:26:11,160 --> 02:26:12,160
All right.

1935
02:26:12,160 --> 02:26:13,160
Zenzero's game review when we come back.

1936
02:26:13,160 --> 02:26:14,160
That'll be fun.

1937
02:26:14,160 --> 02:26:16,160
You've got to get Darkchild in on this one, too.

1938
02:26:16,160 --> 02:26:18,160
He's my cohort here.

1939
02:26:18,160 --> 02:26:25,680
Okay, so, we're gonna listen to some more 2DX fun stuff music, and we'll be right back

1940
02:26:25,680 --> 02:26:30,680
with zero and dark child's game review yay all right we'll be back

1941
02:26:55,680 --> 02:27:00,680
Did we stand together, while it was not a waste of time?

1942
02:27:02,680 --> 02:27:07,680
Let me settle my mind, girl, till you're walking away from me

1943
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:14,680
I'll just close my eyes and feel the pain that I have inside

1944
02:27:15,680 --> 02:27:21,680
What is this pain? What is this pain? What is this pain inside?

1945
02:27:21,680 --> 02:27:25,680
What is this thing? What is this thing?

1946
02:27:25,680 --> 02:27:29,680
I thought that you were mine

1947
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:35,680
Well, it's time to say goodbye

1948
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:41,680
I can't even realize

1949
02:27:41,680 --> 02:27:49,680
And I know you'll be the one in my own life

1950
02:27:49,680 --> 02:27:56,180
I'll never forget the way that you kissed and the way that you smiled

1951
02:27:56,180 --> 02:28:03,680
Forever, where did it come from?

1952
02:28:03,680 --> 02:28:06,680
What is this baby? What is this baby?

1953
02:28:06,680 --> 02:28:09,680
What is this baby?

1954
02:28:09,680 --> 02:28:13,680
I can't find a home

1955
02:29:09,680 --> 02:29:10,680
Oh!

1956
02:29:10,680 --> 02:29:11,680
Oh!

1957
02:29:11,680 --> 02:29:12,680
Oh!

1958
02:29:12,680 --> 02:29:13,680
Oh!

1959
02:30:13,680 --> 02:30:25,680
You must be, you must be, you must be

1960
02:30:25,680 --> 02:30:28,680
You know you need a brother

1961
02:30:28,680 --> 02:30:56,680
Can you make me feel that you're learning what's real?

1962
02:30:56,680 --> 02:31:02,680
So make them feel that you're mine and you're mine

1963
02:31:18,680 --> 02:31:22,680
You're mine and you're mine

1964
02:31:22,680 --> 02:31:29,680
And if you can't consent

1965
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:36,680
Then you're gonna have to go out

1966
02:31:36,680 --> 02:31:43,680
And if you can't consent

1967
02:31:43,680 --> 02:32:00,360
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

1968
02:32:00,360 --> 02:32:04,320
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

1969
02:32:04,320 --> 02:32:09,600
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

1970
02:32:09,600 --> 02:32:12,920
Well, you're just going to take a left at the Shell Station and then you're going to

1971
02:32:12,920 --> 02:32:17,720
go about a mile anyway you listen you're listening to orange lounge radio and I

1972
02:32:17,720 --> 02:32:25,680
bet you all want to know who won the list less segment so here we go the

1973
02:32:25,680 --> 02:32:30,160
winning lands that we are going to see in Kingdom Hearts 2 if we had our way

1974
02:32:30,160 --> 02:32:42,160
would be in third place, drum roll, Digimon! Digimon land! I forgot to be specific that I was referring to 0-2 because anything after that kind of sucks.

1975
02:32:42,160 --> 02:32:55,160
So Digimon 0-2 land. Alright. Number 2, drum roll, is Spirited Away. Good pick, good pick. I like that one a lot.

1976
02:32:55,160 --> 02:33:07,440
Alright, and in first place, Breath of Anticipation is Gargoyles is the winner for the land you'd

1977
02:33:07,440 --> 02:33:09,440
most like to see in Kingdom Hearts 2.

1978
02:33:09,440 --> 02:33:12,440
And you know the other one?

1979
02:33:12,440 --> 02:33:13,440
No, I...

1980
02:33:13,440 --> 02:33:14,440
Thank God.

1981
02:33:14,440 --> 02:33:15,440
The other one that...

1982
02:33:15,440 --> 02:33:16,440
Which kind of Chippendales are you talking about, Loki?

1983
02:33:16,440 --> 02:33:17,440
The Rangers, man!

1984
02:33:17,440 --> 02:33:18,440
The rest of the Rangers.

1985
02:33:18,440 --> 02:33:21,440
No, my runner-up, my runner-up, though, was Duckburg.

1986
02:33:21,440 --> 02:33:22,440
Duckburg?

1987
02:33:22,440 --> 02:33:23,440
Oh, from DuckTales?

1988
02:33:23,440 --> 02:33:24,440
DuckTales and Darkwing Duck.

1989
02:33:24,440 --> 02:33:30,440
What about freaking, um, no, Doug? Hello? No one said Doug? He's...

1990
02:33:30,440 --> 02:33:32,440
Patty Mayonnaise!

1991
02:33:32,440 --> 02:33:38,440
Uh, Masorella has a good point. Chip and Dale were in Kingdom Hearts 1, just not their little land.

1992
02:33:38,440 --> 02:33:41,440
But they were the guys on the ship, right?

1993
02:33:41,440 --> 02:33:46,440
Yeah, they sent out the ship. You only saw them for, like, two seconds, and that was their shot.

1994
02:33:46,440 --> 02:33:47,440
Alright.

1995
02:33:47,440 --> 02:33:51,440
I wanna know, if it was the gummy ship, why were there no gummy bears?

1996
02:33:51,440 --> 02:33:53,440
Dude, that would've been cool too!

1997
02:33:53,440 --> 02:33:55,440
The gummy bear universe.

1998
02:33:59,440 --> 02:34:03,440
But it wasn't gummy bear! It was the crappy ship!

1999
02:34:03,440 --> 02:34:09,440
It was the, hi, we're really jealous, we have Star Fox Envy, so we're gonna pretend to be Star Fox but not. We suck.

2000
02:34:11,440 --> 02:34:13,440
Damn you, Squeenix.

2001
02:34:13,440 --> 02:34:18,440
You hope to trade for the, um, to get the damn warp drive so you don't have to go through shootin' every fuckin' thing.

2002
02:34:18,440 --> 02:34:22,440
Okay, I'm not even there yet, cause I loaned you my game.

2003
02:34:22,440 --> 02:34:24,440
What, you mean when you travel between worlds?

2004
02:34:24,440 --> 02:34:26,440
I'm like right before Agrabah.

2005
02:34:26,440 --> 02:34:28,440
Oops.

2006
02:34:28,440 --> 02:34:30,440
I just beat it. But you get the warp drive.

2007
02:34:30,440 --> 02:34:32,440
Give me my game back.

2008
02:34:32,440 --> 02:34:34,440
I wanna beat the Hades Cup.

2009
02:34:34,440 --> 02:34:35,440
Okay, thank you.

2010
02:34:35,440 --> 02:34:37,440
Alright, moving on.

2011
02:34:37,440 --> 02:34:41,440
We're gonna get to a new segment, a brand new segment tonight, yay!

2012
02:34:41,440 --> 02:34:48,400
the new segment of Orange Launch Radio, this is where some of our new regulars get to shine.

2013
02:34:48,400 --> 02:34:49,400
Oh my God!

2014
02:34:49,400 --> 02:34:52,200
And it's the orgasm segment, everybody!

2015
02:34:52,200 --> 02:34:53,200
Holy shit!

2016
02:34:53,200 --> 02:34:54,200
Big orgasm, everybody!

2017
02:34:54,200 --> 02:34:55,200
Oh, Rob!

2018
02:34:55,200 --> 02:34:56,200
This is the best thing in the world!

2019
02:34:56,200 --> 02:34:57,200
No, no.

2020
02:34:57,200 --> 02:34:58,200
It's not the orgasm segment.

2021
02:34:58,200 --> 02:34:59,200
No, that's not it.

2022
02:34:59,200 --> 02:35:00,200
All right.

2023
02:35:00,200 --> 02:35:01,200
It is zero...

2024
02:35:01,200 --> 02:35:02,200
Hello, your turn.

2025
02:35:02,200 --> 02:35:03,200
Oh, hi.

2026
02:35:03,200 --> 02:35:10,200
It is zero and Dark Child's video game review.

2027
02:35:10,200 --> 02:35:16,200
Holy shit, and this is a good song to choose.

2028
02:35:16,200 --> 02:35:23,200
Zero and Dark Child's video game review here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2029
02:35:23,200 --> 02:35:28,200
I think BitMania would have just been good by itself.

2030
02:35:28,200 --> 02:35:32,900
I just busted it not seeing that manga really and I haven't even seen the picture inside

2031
02:35:33,540 --> 02:35:36,380
All right, Jamie's showing us battle royale manga right now

2032
02:35:37,620 --> 02:35:39,060
Okay

2033
02:35:39,060 --> 02:35:42,660
I'm about to take that book and drop my pants in the bathroom. Okay?

2034
02:35:43,980 --> 02:35:45,980
I'm about to drop my pants right now

2035
02:35:46,740 --> 02:35:48,740
Thank you. I would aim away

2036
02:35:51,820 --> 02:35:53,820
Back to video games

2037
02:35:53,820 --> 02:36:00,820
Okay, I've decided to make this one not as extensive as last time. It's just going to be a couple random games that we've played throughout the week.

2038
02:36:00,820 --> 02:36:07,820
Number one is starting off with Midnight Club 2, which, if you haven't played it and you have a PS2, go out and rent it, or...

2039
02:36:07,820 --> 02:36:09,820
Buy it. Buy it. Don't rent it. Buy it.

2040
02:36:09,820 --> 02:36:12,820
Well, not everyone's a huge racing fan, so...

2041
02:36:12,820 --> 02:36:14,820
It's still cool.

2042
02:36:14,820 --> 02:36:16,820
What is this, Judgment Day? What the fuck?

2043
02:36:16,820 --> 02:36:18,820
No, um, seriously, if you have a PS2...

2044
02:36:18,820 --> 02:36:23,820
I'm on the 14th of July for the first midnight club racing because I'm SUCKED ASS!

2045
02:36:23,820 --> 02:36:30,820
I want my $5 back!

2046
02:36:53,820 --> 02:36:55,820
Yeah, you start off with an escort.

2047
02:36:55,820 --> 02:36:57,820
Yeah, an escort. What is it they call that?

2048
02:36:57,820 --> 02:36:59,820
Something SI is what they call that.

2049
02:36:59,820 --> 02:37:04,820
Yeah, but it was pretty... The game is good, the graphics are fluid, the music is actually really decent.

2050
02:37:04,820 --> 02:37:10,820
It has some pretty good tracks running through the background. I'm not familiar with artists, but you probably know more than I do.

2051
02:37:10,820 --> 02:37:15,820
There's no one in particular that we really know. Looks like a lot of their own in-house people.

2052
02:37:15,820 --> 02:37:20,020
One good thing about this game also is that, which is something they should have done with

2053
02:37:20,020 --> 02:37:24,540
the first one, is there's a lot of shortcuts you can take to, you know, win races faster

2054
02:37:24,540 --> 02:37:28,120
or hit checkpoints in different orders and stuff like that.

2055
02:37:28,120 --> 02:37:29,860
And the game is fucking hard.

2056
02:37:29,860 --> 02:37:30,860
Yeah, the game is a bitch.

2057
02:37:30,860 --> 02:37:34,520
Alright, you win the first couple races pretty easy, and then like, all of a sudden it jumps

2058
02:37:34,520 --> 02:37:37,580
up and you have to really race them perfectly.

2059
02:37:37,580 --> 02:37:42,220
You wanna talk about a hard race, just race a, just get, drive the motorcycle.

2060
02:37:42,220 --> 02:37:43,220
Oh shit, drive the motorcycle anywhere.

2061
02:37:43,220 --> 02:37:44,220
And watch as you die.

2062
02:37:44,220 --> 02:37:49,220
I thought it was cool because you actually had to lean in order to shift your weight in order to turn a motorcycle.

2063
02:37:49,220 --> 02:37:54,220
So definitely this is a game to buy or rent, depending on how big of a racing fan you are.

2064
02:37:54,220 --> 02:37:57,220
If you're kind of racy, just thinking about it, rent it.

2065
02:37:57,220 --> 02:38:02,220
And if you don't have a PS2 and you have an Xbox, which I don't know why the fuck you'd have an Xbox.

2066
02:38:02,220 --> 02:38:04,220
Maybe just throw it at kids or something.

2067
02:38:04,220 --> 02:38:07,220
Hey, fuck Halo!

2068
02:38:07,220 --> 02:38:09,220
Yeah, I'm going to go with Halo, buddy, I'd like that game.

2069
02:38:09,220 --> 02:38:11,220
Halo sucks ass.

2070
02:38:11,220 --> 02:38:13,220
And the mech game.

2071
02:38:41,220 --> 02:38:45,220
There's no dick-measuring challenges here!

2072
02:38:45,220 --> 02:38:49,220
Anyways, I'm trying to save for the last three minutes.

2073
02:38:49,220 --> 02:38:59,220
If you have an Xbox for god knows what reasons, it's going to be out, I believe, next month for the Xbox with improved graphics and blah blah blah, and wait.

2074
02:38:59,220 --> 02:39:02,220
Of course you need an Xbox! You won't play DDR Xbox!

2075
02:39:02,220 --> 02:39:16,220
I got to play for a short period of time, which is actually really fun, it's at my house, I gotta start playing it more, is Panzer Dragoon Orta for the Xbox.

2076
02:39:16,220 --> 02:39:26,220
That game owns me, and that is sad because I fucking hate the Xbox. But I have to speak unbiased, and that sucks ass.

2077
02:39:26,220 --> 02:39:35,220
First of all, it's Panzer Dragoon Orta. It's SEGA. Microsoft has not tainted this game except to host the game.

2078
02:39:35,220 --> 02:39:38,220
Well, they put their Xbox logo all over the fucking place.

2079
02:39:38,220 --> 02:39:40,220
But besides that, it's SEGA.

2080
02:39:40,220 --> 02:39:42,220
SEGA is now the whore of Xbox.

2081
02:39:42,220 --> 02:39:45,220
You know, there's actual talks of SEGA merging with Namco.

2082
02:39:45,220 --> 02:39:47,220
Yeah, but Xbox is also talking...

2083
02:39:47,220 --> 02:39:54,220
Yeah, originally it wasn't supposed to be EA or Namco, and then Namco decided to put up more money.

2084
02:39:54,220 --> 02:40:01,220
Yeah, it's definitely a good game, nice and smooth, and it's pretty much everything you remember from before.

2085
02:40:01,220 --> 02:40:03,220
Just visually, like, amazing.

2086
02:40:03,220 --> 02:40:08,220
Visually enhanced. You're still doing pretty much the same thing that you did in the very first Panzer Dragoon.

2087
02:40:08,220 --> 02:40:09,220
It's a shooter.

2088
02:40:09,220 --> 02:40:13,220
Yeah, but it's very fun. It's something that you will never get tired of until you beat it.

2089
02:40:13,220 --> 02:40:19,220
And there's so much stuff to unlock. You can unlock the original Panzer Dragoon, also on Dreamcast, you can unlock that.

2090
02:40:19,220 --> 02:40:23,220
There's a whole bunch of different Dragoons you can unlock for you to change to.

2091
02:40:23,220 --> 02:40:25,980
You mean, why do you mean Dreamcast, you mean Saturn?

2092
02:40:25,980 --> 02:40:26,980
Sorry, Saturn.

2093
02:40:26,980 --> 02:40:27,980
Oh my god.

2094
02:40:27,980 --> 02:40:34,140
But, um, yeah, definitely, she keeps showing me this fucking book and it's like, yeah.

2095
02:40:34,140 --> 02:40:35,140
Anyways, and-

2096
02:40:35,140 --> 02:40:36,140
Ugh!

2097
02:40:36,140 --> 02:40:37,140
Ugh!

2098
02:40:37,140 --> 02:40:38,140
Ugh!

2099
02:40:38,140 --> 02:40:39,140
Ugh!

2100
02:40:39,140 --> 02:40:40,140
Oh, that was good.

2101
02:40:40,140 --> 02:40:45,660
Just to go back to old school, let's, let's take a trip back to TimeSplitters 2.

2102
02:40:45,660 --> 02:40:46,660
This is-

2103
02:40:46,660 --> 02:40:47,660
If we're traveling back in time to this one.

2104
02:40:47,660 --> 02:40:48,660
The funniest game.

2105
02:40:48,660 --> 02:40:52,200
We're not traveling back hell of far, but we're going back a little while.

2106
02:40:52,200 --> 02:40:59,200
This game is hilarious except for the fact that you will probably never ever unlock absolutely

2107
02:40:59,200 --> 02:41:00,480
everything in this game.

2108
02:41:00,480 --> 02:41:04,600
I've been playing it since it came out and I still don't even have half the characters

2109
02:41:04,600 --> 02:41:05,600
unlocked.

2110
02:41:05,600 --> 02:41:09,300
The cool thing about this game is that, well the thing that Jim and I were playing last

2111
02:41:09,300 --> 02:41:12,240
night is that you can have a fire extinguisher and brick fight.

2112
02:41:12,240 --> 02:41:17,280
You sit there and throw bricks at each other.

2113
02:41:17,280 --> 02:41:24,440
The coolest thing was, I was a monkey, and Jim was one of the sergeant guys.

2114
02:41:24,440 --> 02:41:30,160
The monkey is a foot and a half tall, and then you got, the sergeant guy was like 6'6".

2115
02:41:30,160 --> 02:41:33,120
So this guy's punching over your hand, I'm just walking up sucker punching him, and the

2116
02:41:33,120 --> 02:41:35,960
monkey has hella power, but no stamina.

2117
02:41:35,960 --> 02:41:42,320
Yeah, I'm having to look down all the time just to hit him, but for some reason he's

2118
02:41:42,320 --> 02:41:47,120
just so goddamn quick, all my shots just constantly keep missing, and he's constantly getting

2119
02:41:47,120 --> 02:41:53,200
and a good few sucker punches on me. And he kicked the crap out of me, and he's a frickin'

2120
02:41:53,200 --> 02:41:54,200
monkey, so.

2121
02:41:54,200 --> 02:41:57,400
Because I was a monkey. The monkey, it's all about monkey power. Anyways.

2122
02:41:57,400 --> 02:41:59,040
That goddamn meekie!

2123
02:41:59,040 --> 02:42:05,200
Yeah. Basically, the game, the graphics are really good. You gotta love the facial expressions.

2124
02:42:05,200 --> 02:42:08,200
The facial expressions and the voice acting.

2125
02:42:08,200 --> 02:42:13,120
The voice acting is probably one of the best that I've seen in a game in a long time.

2126
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:16,800
And I like the fact that they did, the facial expressions and everything was very cartoony,

2127
02:42:16,800 --> 02:42:21,320
like it should be. They weren't trying to be realistic people who were over-exaggerated

2128
02:42:21,320 --> 02:42:22,320
by counters.

2129
02:42:22,320 --> 02:42:23,320
Yeah, they weren't trying to be serious. We're not trying to go fucking Half-Life or Counter-Strike,

2130
02:42:23,320 --> 02:42:24,320
which is fun to play.

2131
02:42:24,320 --> 02:42:27,860
And they had the big-breasted chicks, just like the first one.

2132
02:42:27,860 --> 02:42:29,460
Dude, the Jungle Queen.

2133
02:42:29,460 --> 02:42:30,460
Jungle Queen?

2134
02:42:30,460 --> 02:42:31,460
Jungle Queen.

2135
02:42:31,460 --> 02:42:32,460
Jungle Queen.

2136
02:42:32,460 --> 02:42:36,300
Dude, okay. She has shit cover in the front, but her ass is totally exposed to the back.

2137
02:42:36,300 --> 02:42:38,920
Yeah, it's a cheetah thong that doesn't really have a backstrap.

2138
02:42:38,920 --> 02:42:41,500
Yeah, it's like velcro to her skin or something.

2139
02:42:41,500 --> 02:42:42,500
Yeah.

2140
02:42:42,500 --> 02:42:43,500
It's paint.

2141
02:42:43,500 --> 02:42:44,500
It's paint or something.

2142
02:42:44,500 --> 02:42:46,500
Maybe it's all natural. Who knows?

2143
02:42:46,500 --> 02:42:54,500
Basically, if you want a game to eat up time, do time splitters. It's fun, and there's so much shit to unlock.

2144
02:42:54,500 --> 02:43:01,500
Anna has a level editor, which is the greatest thing in the world. If you want to fuck around with your friends, make an insane level.

2145
02:43:01,500 --> 02:43:12,500
Also, like I said before, you'll probably never unlock everything, and also you can unlock minigames like Snake. It's called Anaconda, though, and it's actually a lot better.

2146
02:43:12,500 --> 02:43:16,500
Johnny just brought up something I should maybe ring up since it's video games.

2147
02:43:16,500 --> 02:43:17,500
What?

2148
02:43:17,500 --> 02:43:22,500
It's not out yet, but Far Cry. A demo I recommend everyone watch to see what this game's going to look like.

2149
02:43:22,500 --> 02:43:25,500
And it's on PC, it's not a console game.

2150
02:43:25,500 --> 02:43:27,500
Yeah, that would suck.

2151
02:43:27,500 --> 02:43:30,500
Once it comes out though, I'll make sure I have a review for you guys.

2152
02:43:30,500 --> 02:43:35,500
Right now there's not a whole lot going on on the PC front that's worth talking about game-wise.

2153
02:43:35,500 --> 02:43:37,500
Vice City's coming out, that's about it.

2154
02:43:37,500 --> 02:43:40,500
Who the hell cares? I mean, seriously, if you haven't fucking played Vice City by now...

2155
02:43:40,500 --> 02:43:41,500
You suck.

2156
02:43:41,500 --> 02:43:43,500
What the hell are you even doing on the face of the earth?

2157
02:43:43,500 --> 02:43:44,500
I just showed up.

2158
02:43:44,500 --> 02:43:45,500
Say hello to Brad.

2159
02:43:45,500 --> 02:43:51,500
I just showed up and the reason why you wouldn't play Vice City on PS2 and you want to play on PC is because it looks like shit on PS2.

2160
02:43:51,500 --> 02:43:53,500
And it's going to look really good on PC. There you go.

2161
02:43:54,500 --> 02:43:55,500
And you're on MP3s too.

2162
02:43:55,500 --> 02:43:56,500
There you go.

2163
02:43:57,500 --> 02:43:58,500
Okay, well yeah, basically...

2164
02:43:58,500 --> 02:43:59,500
And your own cars.

2165
02:43:59,500 --> 02:44:01,500
Um, I don't know, unless you can think of...

2166
02:44:03,500 --> 02:44:05,500
Dude! Okay, hold on. Everybody play the getaway.

2167
02:44:05,500 --> 02:44:07,500
play the getaway

2168
02:44:07,500 --> 02:44:09,340
played the fucking getaway okay

2169
02:44:09,340 --> 02:44:14,460
you will hear the word fuck in the opening scene at least fifty fucking times

2170
02:44:14,460 --> 02:44:17,720
and it's funny when you hear them random american guy in there

2171
02:44:17,720 --> 02:44:20,700
like he crashed his car and goes hey i just painted that

2172
02:44:20,700 --> 02:44:24,380
and fuck in the middle of fucking uk yeah

2173
02:44:24,380 --> 02:44:25,820
there's okay

2174
02:44:25,820 --> 02:44:27,420
i'm sitting here playing

2175
02:44:27,420 --> 02:44:30,300
and cara's over my house and this guy says

2176
02:44:30,300 --> 02:44:34,620
i need to get your details and someone thought he said i need my cheetos anyways

2177
02:44:34,620 --> 02:44:36,620
I can't think of anything else. That's pretty much the end of it for this week.

2178
02:44:36,620 --> 02:44:38,620
I can't think of another fucking bloody fucking thing.

2179
02:44:38,620 --> 02:44:40,620
Play Counter-Strike online.

2180
02:44:40,620 --> 02:44:42,620
Kill Johnny.

2181
02:44:42,620 --> 02:44:44,620
Because he's really good at that.

2182
02:44:44,620 --> 02:44:50,620
Kill anyone that says 9, the number 9, 1, and then the number 6 in their name.

2183
02:44:50,620 --> 02:44:52,620
Because they suck and they all die.

2184
02:44:52,620 --> 02:44:54,620
Hey, my first day playing I was killing people.

2185
02:44:54,620 --> 02:44:58,620
And his name's Unstoppable. If you find 916, Unstoppable.

2186
02:44:58,620 --> 02:45:00,620
And now I have my retro review.

2187
02:45:00,620 --> 02:45:05,420
if you if you go after eighty team nine one six you will die trust me you after

2188
02:45:05,420 --> 02:45:08,460
nine one six you will die

2189
02:45:08,460 --> 02:45:11,500
that's the end of the game segment alright he wants to say something

2190
02:45:11,500 --> 02:45:13,220
uh... yes loki

2191
02:45:13,220 --> 02:45:17,400
uh... also being released they mentioned this weeks weeks months ago

2192
02:45:17,400 --> 02:45:21,500
uh... is going to be one must fall battlegrounds the three d fighter

2193
02:45:21,500 --> 02:45:23,900
ooh, did that come out?

2194
02:45:23,900 --> 02:45:27,660
well anyways i couldn't beta test it because the fucking thing wouldn't work on dial-up

2195
02:45:27,660 --> 02:45:29,480
yet they just gave it to me anyways

2196
02:45:29,480 --> 02:45:33,280
I have a demo, a really early demo, and I'm not beta testing it anymore, unfortunately.

2197
02:45:33,280 --> 02:45:35,120
But it's coming out, so look for it.

2198
02:45:35,120 --> 02:45:36,120
It looks really sweet.

2199
02:45:36,120 --> 02:45:37,120
They've got really kick-ass arenas.

2200
02:45:37,120 --> 02:45:40,920
They reproduce all the robots, like, perfectly and added more, and it's really fun.

2201
02:45:40,920 --> 02:45:43,680
They've got, like, a bunch of different modes you can play in.

2202
02:45:43,680 --> 02:45:47,200
Like, they have, like, a sports-type thing where it's, like, some sort of soccer-type

2203
02:45:47,200 --> 02:45:50,480
thing, and then, like, just death matches and crazy shit like that.

2204
02:45:50,480 --> 02:45:51,960
All right, something...

2205
02:45:51,960 --> 02:45:52,960
Oh.

2206
02:45:52,960 --> 02:45:55,520
The Scatman needs to be the theme for this.

2207
02:45:55,520 --> 02:45:57,120
No, it's listless now.

2208
02:45:57,120 --> 02:45:58,120
Oh.

2209
02:45:58,120 --> 02:45:59,120
All right.

2210
02:45:59,120 --> 02:46:05,840
to bring to the table. Retro review. Retro review. Space Harrier on the 32X. It's the

2211
02:46:05,840 --> 02:46:16,200
arcade version, end of story. Beautiful. Welcome to the fantasy zone, get ready. If you guys

2212
02:46:16,200 --> 02:46:23,320
actually want us to review new games, be sure to tell me so that I can actually get out

2213
02:46:23,320 --> 02:46:28,800
there and test them because seriously, I have no idea what you guys want to know about so

2214
02:46:28,800 --> 02:46:33,960
Drop me a line either in the chat room or email me or something.

2215
02:46:33,960 --> 02:46:35,400
Most people have my information.

2216
02:46:35,400 --> 02:46:36,400
That's it.

2217
02:46:36,400 --> 02:46:37,400
Alright.

2218
02:46:37,400 --> 02:46:43,560
Hopefully, I don't know when they're shipping out the ship from, um, for DDR Max 2.

2219
02:46:43,560 --> 02:46:47,160
Maybe not next week, but hopefully a week after we'll have a review on DDR Max 2.

2220
02:46:47,160 --> 02:46:49,320
Uh, yes, because it's coming out this week, right?

2221
02:46:49,320 --> 02:46:52,280
Yeah, I've got mine already preordered and everything, but I don't know if they ship

2222
02:46:52,280 --> 02:46:55,400
them to arrive at your, like, house today.

2223
02:46:55,400 --> 02:46:56,400
Yeah.

2224
02:46:56,400 --> 02:46:59,400
I think they ship it on that date, so in which case I'll get it the week after.

2225
02:46:59,400 --> 02:47:04,400
If we're able to get our hands on it this week, look for Orange Lounge Radio to go live the night we get it.

2226
02:47:04,400 --> 02:47:09,400
Bring it over, we'll go live with it the night we get it, and we'll play the new stuff for you right off the bat.

2227
02:47:09,400 --> 02:47:11,400
We'll unlock stuff on-air and play them.

2228
02:47:11,400 --> 02:47:16,400
Yeah, I'll do the controller trick, man, and fucking unlock the whole fucking game in one night.

2229
02:47:16,400 --> 02:47:30,520
Alright, while they drool over Battle Royale manga, we've only got ten minutes left in

2230
02:47:30,520 --> 02:47:41,920
the show, but we're going to do a favorite segment of ours called Ask Orange Lounge.

2231
02:47:41,920 --> 02:47:48,700
This is where you can ask us whatever you want, send us questions over a private message

2232
02:47:48,700 --> 02:47:50,100
in the chat room.

2233
02:47:50,100 --> 02:47:54,700
However, some of your questions in the past have really sucked.

2234
02:47:54,700 --> 02:47:57,540
Like, will you give me money?

2235
02:47:57,540 --> 02:47:58,540
Will you buy me this?

2236
02:47:58,540 --> 02:47:59,540
Will you do this?

2237
02:47:59,540 --> 02:48:00,540
No.

2238
02:48:00,540 --> 02:48:03,540
Stupid questions are not getting asked anymore on the show, so please send us something that's

2239
02:48:03,540 --> 02:48:04,540
worth answering.

2240
02:48:04,540 --> 02:48:05,540
Thank you.

2241
02:48:05,540 --> 02:48:09,540
If you ask a stupid question, you'll be kicked, didn't you?

2242
02:48:09,540 --> 02:48:10,540
Yeah.

2243
02:48:10,540 --> 02:48:11,540
Alright.

2244
02:48:11,540 --> 02:48:20,540
I welcome your questions. We do like to say that there's no such question as a stupid question, but are you going to buy me this as a stupid question? I'm sorry.

2245
02:48:20,540 --> 02:48:28,540
If you ask the question, am I stupid?, we're all going to have a nice, big yes for you. Have a nice day. That's from me.

2246
02:48:28,540 --> 02:48:32,540
Here we go.

2247
02:48:32,540 --> 02:48:36,540
Hmm, all right.

2248
02:48:36,540 --> 02:48:41,540
23rd Magus has a question, and it's kind of a personal life question that nobody else

2249
02:48:41,540 --> 02:48:45,540
that, or nobody that doesn't chat in Orange Lounge regularly is probably going to get.

2250
02:48:45,540 --> 02:48:51,540
But he does want to ask, he does want to ask, who loaned him enough balls to get Angel a ring?

2251
02:48:51,540 --> 02:48:52,540
He did.

2252
02:48:52,540 --> 02:48:54,540
He did!

2253
02:48:54,540 --> 02:48:57,540
I have a return question. Why are you even asking us?

2254
02:48:57,540 --> 02:48:59,540
Yeah, you know who gave you the balls.

2255
02:49:00,540 --> 02:49:10,540
I mean, I would say, um, I would say, uh, when you're up on the altar, that's gonna take, like, 50 times the balls.

2256
02:49:10,540 --> 02:49:11,540
Because he gave them the balls!

2257
02:49:11,540 --> 02:49:15,540
Not to jump to conclusions here, because, you know, these are long ways off in the future.

2258
02:49:15,540 --> 02:49:21,540
I had a great idea for a mat that had different conclusions on it, and you would jump to them.

2259
02:49:21,540 --> 02:49:23,540
Yeah, I'm kind of jumping to conclusions here.

2260
02:49:23,540 --> 02:49:28,540
But it's just one small step. It's more of a case of money than balls.

2261
02:49:28,540 --> 02:49:32,540
I mean, there's not really balls involved. You like a girl, you buy her something.

2262
02:49:32,540 --> 02:49:35,540
There's really no balls involved in that. That's just money.

2263
02:49:35,540 --> 02:49:36,540
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2264
02:49:36,540 --> 02:49:42,540
When we get into the longer-term commitment stuff, that's going to be the really ballsy stuff.

2265
02:49:42,540 --> 02:49:43,540
That's what I'm trying to say.

2266
02:49:43,540 --> 02:49:45,540
Stop patting your ego.

2267
02:49:45,540 --> 02:49:48,540
Stop patting your ego.

2268
02:49:48,540 --> 02:49:50,540
Stop. Right now.

2269
02:49:50,540 --> 02:49:52,540
Darkchild has something to add?

2270
02:49:52,540 --> 02:49:55,540
Someone wanted to get balls from someone and I wasn't asked to donate?

2271
02:49:59,540 --> 02:50:00,540
Alright.

2272
02:50:00,540 --> 02:50:02,540
I have a question. Why don't we have a panda mic?

2273
02:50:04,540 --> 02:50:11,540
Jonas, if you're listening, I gave you $2 a long time ago at the tournament to get me a balls and you never got it for me.

2274
02:50:12,540 --> 02:50:14,540
Okay, fine then. Since he procced up someone I want your money.

2275
02:50:14,540 --> 02:50:19,540
RoboZ, if you're fucking listening, you still owe me $3 from fucking MGL2.

2276
02:50:19,540 --> 02:50:22,540
I don't want my money, I want a ball, dammit.

2277
02:50:49,540 --> 02:50:54,540
I found an MP3 that sounds good that would work with something else, and that's what I normally do.

2278
02:50:54,540 --> 02:50:56,540
I don't really think of it beforehand.

2279
02:50:56,540 --> 02:50:59,540
So nothing yet except maybe ghosts, maybe.

2280
02:50:59,540 --> 02:51:01,540
Maybe, maybe ghosts. I tried it, it was alright.

2281
02:51:01,540 --> 02:51:06,540
There was another one I heard that I thought I could mix with insertion, but I don't know.

2282
02:51:06,540 --> 02:51:09,540
I might, yeah, we'll see.

2283
02:51:11,540 --> 02:51:15,540
I have to wait until I get my vinyl, because my vinyl's coming, and then, yeah.

2284
02:51:15,540 --> 02:51:29,540
Yeah, there's going to be, you know, obviously the show's going to be getting a new Thursday night event, well, at some point in season 3, or it's going to be the live mix show, in the mix vinyl on air.

2285
02:51:29,540 --> 02:51:37,540
That's going to be pretty awesome. That'll be one to listen for. Okay, we're moving right along. I've got a lot of questions to get through in only a few more minutes.

2286
02:51:37,540 --> 02:51:42,540
Okay, here we go. Zero. Question for Zero from 23rd Magus.

2287
02:51:42,540 --> 02:51:43,540
I'm scared.

2288
02:51:43,540 --> 02:51:47,540
Zero, what would you do with two Quai Jap girls, a bucket of Choco Ready Whip, and cake pie?

2289
02:51:50,540 --> 02:51:57,540
Yeah, what wouldn't I do? Oh, fuck you, pal. No, first of all, they have to be of age. Thank you.

2290
02:51:58,540 --> 02:52:04,540
He may say of age, but, you know, I will travel to the state where it is legal.

2291
02:52:04,540 --> 02:52:05,540
La la la la la.

2292
02:52:05,540 --> 02:52:10,540
Well, actually, unless it was the UK, because 16 is, you know, their...

2293
02:52:10,540 --> 02:52:12,540
Hawaii, 14.

2294
02:52:12,540 --> 02:52:13,540
Hawaii $5.00.

2295
02:52:13,540 --> 02:52:16,540
Oh my lord, is that your answer? What wouldn't you do? Or do you have a better answer?

2296
02:52:16,540 --> 02:52:25,540
No, okay, I would do pretty much everything within reason. I wouldn't go, like, pour them out to animals or something.

2297
02:52:25,540 --> 02:52:30,540
And what about cake pie? You wouldn't make them eat the cake pie?

2298
02:52:30,540 --> 02:52:32,540
Anyway...

2299
02:52:32,540 --> 02:52:33,540
You wouldn't make them eat something.

2300
02:52:33,540 --> 02:52:39,540
Hey Loki, about your Hawaii comment, they gotta have grass on the field before you can play ball.

2301
02:52:42,540 --> 02:52:43,540
It's a, you know...

2302
02:52:45,540 --> 02:52:48,540
Just because the grass grows does mean it needs to be there.

2303
02:52:49,540 --> 02:52:51,540
Oh my fucking god.

2304
02:52:54,540 --> 02:52:56,540
Moving right along.

2305
02:52:57,540 --> 02:53:00,540
Akuma GM has a good question.

2306
02:53:00,540 --> 02:53:05,540
Does Beatmania 2DX have a chance in the US?

2307
02:53:05,540 --> 02:53:08,540
Why? Why no, Zero? Why no?

2308
02:53:08,540 --> 02:53:12,540
Do we really want to let them ruin another good game?

2309
02:53:12,540 --> 02:53:17,540
If a goat can sing in American Idol, anything's possible.

2310
02:53:17,540 --> 02:53:23,540
Let them move! Let them move!

2311
02:53:23,540 --> 02:53:27,540
If DDR US Mix was allowed, anything could happen.

2312
02:53:27,540 --> 02:53:32,540
I second that notion. If DDR-US mix is allowed, 2DX-US mix can't be far behind.

2313
02:53:32,540 --> 02:53:34,540
DDR-USA did not happen.

2314
02:53:34,540 --> 02:53:39,540
Alright. I'm cutting off questions now. These last five questions I have are it.

2315
02:53:39,540 --> 02:53:46,540
Okay. Vidpala, why does cereal cost so much, and what is your favorite cereal?

2316
02:53:46,540 --> 02:53:52,540
I like Frosted Mini Wheats. I want to answer your other question.

2317
02:53:52,540 --> 02:53:57,540
If you go to Bel Air or Safeway, they have two boxes of cereal for four dollars.

2318
02:53:57,540 --> 02:54:03,540
All the Kellogg's brands. And besides, I like Apple Jacks. Because I just do.

2319
02:54:03,540 --> 02:54:05,540
They don't taste like apples!

2320
02:54:05,540 --> 02:54:07,540
They don't taste like apples, stupid!

2321
02:54:07,540 --> 02:54:09,540
What's wrong with you?

2322
02:54:09,540 --> 02:54:11,540
That's not an answer! They didn't really have an answer.

2323
02:54:11,540 --> 02:54:12,540
I have another favorite.

2324
02:54:12,540 --> 02:54:13,540
Crackle Jacks.

2325
02:54:13,540 --> 02:54:14,540
I like Crackle and Oat Bran.

2326
02:54:14,540 --> 02:54:16,540
Crackle and Oat Bran. Go for it.

2327
02:54:18,540 --> 02:54:20,540
It doesn't crackle like Snap Crackle Pop.

2328
02:54:20,540 --> 02:54:22,540
Alright, let's move on, because we've got a bunch of questions to get through.

2329
02:54:22,540 --> 02:54:27,540
Alright, um, I like Special K and Fruity Pebbles in Captain Crunch.

2330
02:54:27,540 --> 02:54:29,540
It depends what kind of mood I'm in.

2331
02:54:29,540 --> 02:54:32,540
Healthy, you know, I go with Special K.

2332
02:54:32,540 --> 02:54:34,540
Fruity, I go with Fruity Pebbles.

2333
02:54:34,540 --> 02:54:39,540
And just damn Cavity, you know, juicing, I go with Captain Crunch.

2334
02:54:39,540 --> 02:54:41,540
And why cereal so expensive? Because it's all the damn toys.

2335
02:54:41,540 --> 02:54:43,540
And it sponsors terrorism.

2336
02:54:43,540 --> 02:54:48,540
You know, actually, I used to name my stepbrother Special K.

2337
02:54:48,540 --> 02:54:54,620
Now, why it costs so much, it's because it's somehow in some form controlled by the government.

2338
02:54:54,620 --> 02:54:55,620
I don't know how.

2339
02:54:55,620 --> 02:54:56,620
I'll figure that out later.

2340
02:54:56,620 --> 02:54:59,500
But I like to eat what I have for breakfast this morning, but normally I'll just take

2341
02:54:59,500 --> 02:55:04,620
any kind of cereal and just mix them all together and add sugar and a little bit of milk, just

2342
02:55:04,620 --> 02:55:05,620
all the cereals together.

2343
02:55:05,620 --> 02:55:06,620
That way you get the best of all.

2344
02:55:06,620 --> 02:55:11,460
You get the marshmallows, the apple jacks that don't taste like apples, the crackling

2345
02:55:11,460 --> 02:55:13,860
goat brain, and...

2346
02:55:13,860 --> 02:55:19,860
Donnie Darko Rock, Cellar Door, Cellar Door!

2347
02:55:19,860 --> 02:55:21,860
What you ate for breakfast this morning?

2348
02:55:21,860 --> 02:55:23,860
Shut up!

2349
02:55:30,860 --> 02:55:36,860
I had some of these little Japanese candies that have been sitting by the computer for a couple of days.

2350
02:55:36,860 --> 02:55:43,180
Yeah, okay my favorite cereal. I don't need a lot of cereal, but when I do eat cereal my favorite is the Pop's

2351
02:55:43,700 --> 02:55:45,700
Pop's Pop's

2352
02:55:47,300 --> 02:55:49,300
The Pop's

2353
02:55:49,500 --> 02:55:54,980
Corn Pop's yeah, but yeah Corn Pop's those are jamming okay, and the reason why?

2354
02:55:55,820 --> 02:56:00,580
The reason why cereal is so expensive is because it's owned by Disney I

2355
02:56:00,580 --> 02:56:06,620
I say, if you think it's expensive, just go buy it at Sam's Club or Costco and buy me

2356
02:56:06,620 --> 02:56:09,140
a big box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, please. Thank you.

2357
02:56:09,140 --> 02:56:14,580
All right. Quick questions. Here we go. No Styling wants to know, when will Orange Lounge

2358
02:56:14,580 --> 02:56:18,860
be available for DVD or CD? Unfortunately, due to the music that we play during the show,

2359
02:56:18,860 --> 02:56:26,100
we can't really sell it. As far as the content's concerns, we're still debating kind of the

2360
02:56:26,100 --> 02:56:29,780
whole Internet distribution thing, especially now that some of our episodes are, get this,

2361
02:56:29,780 --> 02:56:34,500
a year old, getting there. We're thinking about letting those get distributed on Loki's

2362
02:56:34,500 --> 02:56:40,580
site later, so. But as far as, like, a CD stuff, it's not really a point. Maybe a clip

2363
02:56:40,580 --> 02:56:44,940
CD or something. But fortunately, the quality of the show, since we, well, the problem is

2364
02:56:44,940 --> 02:56:48,780
is that we're so, we're so low, because of the modem band, the quality of the show's

2365
02:56:48,780 --> 02:56:55,640
really low, there wouldn't be much point to do an audio CD. It would kind of suck.

2366
02:56:55,640 --> 02:57:03,640
Two questions. RYC3, this is kind of for Zero and Darkchild, wants to know, Rice wants to know if you will do a game review on Raven Shield.

2367
02:57:03,640 --> 02:57:05,640
What is that on?

2368
02:57:05,640 --> 02:57:09,640
We covered Raven Shield of Liberty, or I did, back at the tournament weekend.

2369
02:57:09,640 --> 02:57:12,640
We didn't have much talk about it though. We can check it out again.

2370
02:57:12,640 --> 02:57:20,640
Once they come out with a patch that allows it to be played on my computer, because it detects a back graphics card, then we'll review it.

2371
02:57:20,640 --> 02:57:30,640
I just saw something. I wonder if we can actually dual record the show, like record an archive file and record a high resolution, like a high quality file.

2372
02:57:30,640 --> 02:57:33,640
What if I had a really good computer?

2373
02:57:33,640 --> 02:57:37,640
I've thought about it and there's a way to do it and maybe when we move. We'll see.

2374
02:57:37,640 --> 02:57:47,640
I'll try to do one on Raven Shield for you. Give me a couple weeks to find it and get it set up and I'll have it taken care of.

2375
02:57:47,640 --> 02:57:51,140
this is the style tone

2376
02:57:51,140 --> 02:57:52,440
alright so here we go

2377
02:57:52,440 --> 02:57:55,520
uh... last questions from snugdwarf

2378
02:57:55,520 --> 02:57:59,340
last question from you OK

2379
02:57:59,340 --> 02:58:03,640
is being my paradise not of the major ass suck? I personally hate that song the

2380
02:58:03,640 --> 02:58:06,440
steps the fact that it's on DDR but i was wondering what you guys think of

2381
02:58:06,440 --> 02:58:08,360
that stinky piece of elephant poop

2382
02:58:08,360 --> 02:58:11,760
I love that song since i saw Wendell freestyle it

2383
02:58:11,760 --> 02:58:14,480
uh... the song itself

2384
02:58:14,480 --> 02:58:20,480
This sucks, um, I can't think of anything violent. It sucks Smegma.

2385
02:58:22,480 --> 02:58:26,480
I thought it was time, but I like all the songs that nobody likes, so there you go.

2386
02:58:26,480 --> 02:58:32,480
But you know, to be honest, a lot of the club mix stuff really sucks. I mean, the original Jam Jam Reggae sucks.

2387
02:58:32,480 --> 02:58:33,480
Jam Jam Reggae sucks.

2388
02:58:33,480 --> 02:58:35,480
Like, Emotion, Emotion sucks ass.

2389
02:58:35,480 --> 02:58:36,480
Emotion sucks ass.

2390
02:58:36,480 --> 02:58:42,480
Okay, Emotion sucks ass on there because it sounds like they just recorded someone doing just the key presses of it.

2391
02:58:42,480 --> 02:58:46,560
even like recorded good or anything

2392
02:58:46,560 --> 02:58:49,800
and uh... also but the my parents is all right

2393
02:58:49,800 --> 02:58:53,620
this episode step suck ass is really slow

2394
02:58:53,620 --> 02:58:56,760
and the new double steps they made for really suck because they're just

2395
02:58:56,760 --> 02:58:58,140
trying to throw in a bunch of

2396
02:58:58,140 --> 02:59:01,560
sixty note running for no apparent reason

2397
02:59:01,560 --> 02:59:06,720
i'd like to see

2398
02:59:06,720 --> 02:59:08,280
uh... be repaired arabic

2399
02:59:08,280 --> 02:59:13,280
Mr. Wendell, like, did this badass freestyle to it, and big guy freestyles kick ass. I'm sorry.

2400
02:59:13,280 --> 02:59:24,280
Yeah, my appreciation for Be My Paradise went up like tenfold when I saw Wendell humping Mel to it, so that was homoerotic. Wonderful.

2401
02:59:24,280 --> 02:59:28,280
I appreciate Wendell. I don't appreciate the song.

2402
02:59:28,280 --> 02:59:31,280
We love Wendell. We need Wendell on this show.

2403
02:59:31,280 --> 02:59:36,680
Alright, one more question from Snubdismoid wants to know,

2404
02:59:36,680 --> 02:59:38,880
Loki or anyone that makes edits in the room,

2405
02:59:38,880 --> 02:59:42,560
I just recently made an Afro Nova edit, but when I put the steps in the DDR edit max,

2406
02:59:42,560 --> 02:59:45,200
I was two measures short, too many steps.

2407
02:59:45,200 --> 02:59:49,680
I have some extra steps before the normal steps start, so should I just eliminate those?

2408
02:59:49,680 --> 02:59:54,120
No, because DDR edit max, a lot of the gaps that sit on there are wrong.

2409
02:59:54,120 --> 02:59:58,680
I'm gonna fix that at some point, because there's a lot of steps that are out of sync,

2410
02:59:58,680 --> 03:00:05,120
or you'll be in sync on ddr edit max

2411
03:00:05,120 --> 03:00:07,560
you are loose anyways

2412
03:00:07,560 --> 03:00:09,520
now there's a lot of uh...

2413
03:00:09,520 --> 03:00:13,640
a lot of songs where you can make the steps on there i think what was it dynamite raver one of those

2414
03:00:13,640 --> 03:00:17,560
was one of the ones that you make on ddr edit max and then

2415
03:00:17,560 --> 03:00:21,380
he gets all fucked up when you play on the arcade it's like two bars short or something like that

2416
03:00:21,380 --> 03:00:25,320
uh... just what i recommend doing is if you've got something to make an

2417
03:00:55,320 --> 03:00:58,320
And just fix it that way. That's what I did.

2418
03:00:58,320 --> 03:01:06,320
Yeah, that's pretty much it. I'm going to try to fix all of those so that I can, you know, that can be correct.

2419
03:01:06,320 --> 03:01:11,320
But that will come later on. It's on the bottom of my list.

2420
03:01:11,320 --> 03:01:14,320
All right, that's it. All the questions from Ask Orange Lounge have been asked.

2421
03:01:14,320 --> 03:01:16,320
Thank you very much for submitting your questions. We love you.

2422
03:01:16,320 --> 03:01:21,320
And now it's show end time and we ask everybody for their final thoughts.

2423
03:01:21,320 --> 03:01:25,520
final thoughts. You want to go first, Jimmy? You want to wait and let her wait. Zero, final

2424
03:01:25,520 --> 03:01:42,520
thought. Nice catch. I fit under a desk. Just like an intern to be fitting under a desk.

2425
03:01:42,520 --> 03:01:46,600
Shut up, dick. While you're down there. Fuck your mama. I have dusting that needs to be

2426
03:01:46,600 --> 03:01:47,600
be done while you're down there.

2427
03:01:47,600 --> 03:01:48,600
All right.

2428
03:01:48,600 --> 03:01:49,600
I'm on my ass.

2429
03:01:49,600 --> 03:01:50,600
No.

2430
03:01:50,600 --> 03:01:51,600
Jim, final thought.

2431
03:01:51,600 --> 03:01:52,600
Final thought?

2432
03:01:52,600 --> 03:01:58,760
Well, this is a pretty cool show for listening to it for my first time, and it kind of makes

2433
03:01:58,760 --> 03:02:01,680
me wish I lived up here to listen to it every single week, so...

2434
03:02:01,680 --> 03:02:02,680
We roll.

2435
03:02:02,680 --> 03:02:03,680
Thanks.

2436
03:02:03,680 --> 03:02:04,680
Yeah.

2437
03:02:04,680 --> 03:02:05,680
Keep rocking.

2438
03:02:05,680 --> 03:02:06,680
Welcome to the show.

2439
03:02:06,680 --> 03:02:07,680
Listen to the show.

2440
03:02:07,680 --> 03:02:08,680
Well...

2441
03:02:08,680 --> 03:02:16,060
Hey, on your first show, you picked the listless thing that ended up winning, so that's not

2442
03:02:16,060 --> 03:02:17,060
Not too shabby.

2443
03:02:17,060 --> 03:02:20,060
I don't know how I did it, because my two other picks got knocked off.

2444
03:02:20,060 --> 03:02:22,060
Yeah, you kind of had crappy ones out of that.

2445
03:02:22,060 --> 03:02:24,060
But, you know, Garlic Rose was good.

2446
03:02:24,060 --> 03:02:25,060
It's all right.

2447
03:02:25,060 --> 03:02:26,060
It's all right, you're a noob.

2448
03:02:26,060 --> 03:02:28,060
I'm just kind of having a bad day.

2449
03:02:28,060 --> 03:02:32,060
What I want to come up with, you know, just isn't coming up.

2450
03:02:32,060 --> 03:02:33,060
We love noobs on Orange Lounge.

2451
03:02:33,060 --> 03:02:34,060
Noobs love us.

2452
03:02:34,060 --> 03:02:35,060
All right.

2453
03:02:35,060 --> 03:02:36,060
All right.

2454
03:02:36,060 --> 03:02:37,060
Uh, Loki?

2455
03:02:37,060 --> 03:02:41,060
Um, I'm starting to get a headache.

2456
03:02:41,060 --> 03:02:43,060
I can fucking think my blood pressure's up or something.

2457
03:02:43,060 --> 03:02:47,900
I, like, have bad cholesterol or something like that. I, I don't know what it is. I get

2458
03:02:47,900 --> 03:02:55,720
a headache all the time when I come over here. I don't know why. I don't know what it is.

2459
03:02:55,720 --> 03:03:01,240
I blame Rob. Maybe, maybe you have cat dander on you from your cat and then it's, I'm, that's

2460
03:03:01,240 --> 03:03:07,440
why I have a mild headache. Oh, it's probably shirmy that I'm allergic to. Okay, fuck, okay.

2461
03:03:07,440 --> 03:03:09,440
Alright.

2462
03:03:09,440 --> 03:03:10,440
Sorry to hear that.

2463
03:03:10,440 --> 03:03:11,440
Anita?

2464
03:03:11,440 --> 03:03:18,120
Uh, let's see, um, Captain Picard is a better captain than Captain Kirk, because he rocks.

2465
03:03:18,120 --> 03:03:21,960
He's smarter, and he holds his age better.

2466
03:03:21,960 --> 03:03:22,960
Wow.

2467
03:03:22,960 --> 03:03:28,840
Yeah, but he gets it on in Nemesis, and I really don't want to see that.

2468
03:03:28,840 --> 03:03:29,840
I did.

2469
03:03:29,840 --> 03:03:30,840
Dark child.

2470
03:03:30,840 --> 03:03:32,600
yeah

2471
03:03:32,600 --> 03:03:34,480
dark child

2472
03:03:34,480 --> 03:03:38,400
uh... okay that just made me lose some interest

2473
03:03:38,400 --> 03:03:45,400
uh... final thought

2474
03:03:45,880 --> 03:03:47,780
I don't really have a final

2475
03:03:47,780 --> 03:03:49,280
thought I guess

2476
03:03:49,280 --> 03:03:54,280
I'll just throw out something or say everyone's the same

2477
03:03:54,280 --> 03:03:55,680
What the hell did he just say?

2478
03:03:55,680 --> 03:03:57,520
Bombay your final thought?

2479
03:03:57,520 --> 03:04:01,520
My final thought... I don't have one. I don't have any thoughts right now.

2480
03:04:01,520 --> 03:04:06,520
Alright, um, my final thought of the n-

2481
03:04:06,520 --> 03:04:14,520
My final thought is, you voted, they voted off Legend of Trance after one week, and you fucking kept on, goddamn duck toy! What is wrong with you?

2482
03:04:14,520 --> 03:04:18,520
What is wrong with America?

2483
03:04:18,520 --> 03:04:19,520
Don't get me started.

2484
03:04:19,520 --> 03:04:26,520
My final thought, uh, would be, um, God bless the USA!

2485
03:04:26,520 --> 03:04:38,080
My final thought? Fuck you, Squeenix.

2486
03:04:38,080 --> 03:04:45,160
Very well put. And the last word of tonight goes to...

2487
03:04:45,160 --> 03:04:53,120
You had it before, and so did Anita. Let's give it to Jar-Child. Fine. We'll give it

2488
03:04:53,120 --> 03:04:56,120
Last word!

2489
03:04:56,120 --> 03:04:58,120
Excrement cranium.

2490
03:04:58,120 --> 03:05:01,120
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2491
03:05:01,120 --> 03:05:05,120

2492

2494
03:05:18,120 --> 03:05:22,120
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2495
03:05:22,120 --> 03:05:25,120
I will send a flood to wipe out all the bad things.

2496
03:05:25,120 --> 03:05:30,120
I will save two of everything, but everything else goes, and there'll be a lot of umbrellas.

2497
03:05:30,120 --> 03:05:34,120
You, Noah, stop what you're doing and build me an ark.

2498
03:05:34,120 --> 03:05:37,120
And Noah, who was Sean Connery, who was...

2499
03:05:37,120 --> 03:05:42,120
I'm working on a speedboat at the moment.

2500
03:05:42,120 --> 03:05:47,120
Speedboat's much faster. I'll shoo across the water a lot faster.

2501
03:05:47,120 --> 03:05:49,120
It'd be great photos for the Bible.

2502
03:05:55,120 --> 03:05:58,120
No, I appreciate your sense of publicity, but...

2503
03:05:59,120 --> 03:06:01,120
I want an ark with a big room for poo.

2504
03:06:01,120 --> 03:06:02,120
It's going to be important.

2505
03:06:05,120 --> 03:06:06,120
Speed boat. Let's go for a speed boat.

2506
03:06:06,120 --> 03:06:08,120
We can get all the animals with long ears.

2507
03:06:08,120 --> 03:06:10,120
They can sit along the side of their ears.

2508
03:06:13,120 --> 03:06:14,120
Because I like that.

2509
03:06:15,120 --> 03:06:16,120
No, you build me an ark.

2510
03:06:16,120 --> 03:06:20,160
put a big motor in an arc if you want compromise

2511
03:06:20,160 --> 03:06:23,360
so he started to build himself an arc, started sawing up timber

2512
03:06:23,360 --> 03:06:27,640
hu hu hu hu hu hu, that's not actually how you start sawing is it?

2513
03:06:27,640 --> 03:06:31,920
you start sawing by going hu hu hu hu hu

2514
03:06:31,920 --> 03:06:35,120
that first bit where you

2515
03:06:35,120 --> 03:06:41,160
hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu hu

2516
03:06:41,160 --> 03:06:45,160
then you're into the middle bit of hu hu hu hu hu

2517
03:06:45,160 --> 03:06:51,440
where you feel like your dad

2518
03:06:51,440 --> 03:06:57,720
when your dad used to say, I'm off out to the garage to saw a plank of wood in our

2519
03:06:57,720 --> 03:06:59,760
kiddo

2520
03:06:59,760 --> 03:07:03,240
there we go

2521
03:07:03,240 --> 03:07:05,360
no reason for it

2522
03:07:05,360 --> 03:07:11,440
now let's see if Dr Banosky is still on television, the assentive man

2523
03:07:11,440 --> 03:07:14,240
sundays with my dad that was

2524
03:07:14,240 --> 03:07:17,880
so yes, so the middle bit of the song

2525
03:07:17,880 --> 03:07:21,960
and then the end goes back into

2526
03:07:21,960 --> 03:07:28,960
and after a while Noah realized he was actually punching a baboon

2527
03:07:33,780 --> 03:07:35,440
get off me, stop telling me

2528
03:07:35,440 --> 03:07:37,560
what have you got against baboons

2529
03:07:37,560 --> 03:07:41,400
I'm not punching a baboon, I'm showing wood for an ark

2530
03:07:41,400 --> 03:07:43,640
ah, a likely story

2531
03:07:43,640 --> 03:07:50,640
Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.

2532
03:08:13,640 --> 03:08:30,160
Alright, kids, we're back, Orange Lounge Radio, the afterbirth.

2533
03:08:30,160 --> 03:08:31,160
Eeee!

2534
03:08:31,160 --> 03:08:37,600
Oh, Dark Child has something to say, yes, Dark Child.

2535
03:08:37,600 --> 03:08:41,280
Okay, since I wasn't here for Fuck You's, I need to say this.

2536
03:08:41,280 --> 03:08:45,920
Fuck you to like 17 and 16 year old girls to try and pimp on like me and zero

2537
03:08:45,920 --> 03:08:48,840
I mean first of all the freestyle is not that cool

2538
03:08:49,560 --> 03:08:55,280
Especially when I'm up there doing it second of all once you find out that we're 22 and 23

2539
03:08:55,840 --> 03:08:57,240
That means you're under age

2540
03:08:57,240 --> 03:09:02,760
We can't do nothing about that then we call us and find out that we're both taken and have girlfriends

2541
03:09:02,920 --> 03:09:07,040
That doesn't mean the next morning you wake my ass up at 10 o'clock in the morning to see what we want to do

2542
03:09:07,040 --> 03:09:12,040
That means we're not available. That means back the fuck up off of us. Get off my jock.

2543
03:09:12,040 --> 03:09:15,040
You know what? At least I was smart enough to give him a wrong phone number.

2544
03:09:15,040 --> 03:09:22,040
What the fuck, man? No one fucking pips on me when I'm doing shit. What the hell is that?

2545
03:09:22,040 --> 03:09:28,040
Oh, I see. I just know I'm not good enough for you.

2546
03:09:28,040 --> 03:09:31,040
I'm not good enough for the underage preteens.

2547
03:09:31,040 --> 03:09:34,040
Oh, I was good enough for you when I used to work pizza and give you a free...

2548
03:09:34,040 --> 03:09:36,040
You want her number?

2549
03:09:36,040 --> 03:09:43,320
I'm just saying it's the whole no ego building thing. You know. Hey, yeah, it's you don't me here. She's underage, but

2550
03:09:43,840 --> 03:09:46,000
You know man a little bit younger

2551
03:09:47,560 --> 03:09:52,440
But no, it's what the fuck that sucks say I guess way they're like

2552
03:09:54,320 --> 03:09:56,320
Whatever

2553
03:09:57,040 --> 03:09:59,040
Anybody else have something I want to say for after birth

2554
03:10:00,120 --> 03:10:02,120
We're talking cosplay go away. I

2555
03:10:02,120 --> 03:10:07,120
I need to start hanging out with you guys, man, because you get hit on by, like, the chicks and stuff.

2556
03:10:07,120 --> 03:10:09,120
Why are you looking at Jamie Lee?

2557
03:10:09,120 --> 03:10:13,120
I got hit on by girls. I was playing Angel's Sanctuary.

2558
03:10:13,120 --> 03:10:14,120
Sweet.

2559
03:10:14,120 --> 03:10:17,120
I had fan girls and fanboys because I was an it.

2560
03:10:17,120 --> 03:10:19,120
I'm going to try and embarrass Rob.

2561
03:10:19,120 --> 03:10:25,120
Another thought in Afterbirth, Rob looks hot with a collar on. I mean, if I was gay or even bi, I'd do him if he had that collar on.

2562
03:10:25,120 --> 03:10:27,120
Oh, the one picture.

2563
03:10:27,120 --> 03:10:38,280
If I was going out to the rage tonight I could get all gothy, but I'm not because I'm a dork.

2564
03:10:38,280 --> 03:10:41,360
That's it, you guys. Thank you very much for listening to Orange Lawn Radio and the Afterbirth

2565
03:10:41,360 --> 03:10:48,120
and the whole Nine Yards. After the show tonight is a whole lot of old music, Bamani music.

2566
03:10:48,120 --> 03:10:52,240
There's lots of five key stuff in here and really old stuff, so you guys want to stay

2567
03:10:52,240 --> 03:10:57,040
tuned. Tons of stuff you're not hearing right now currently in Bamani music and more, but

thank god

2580
03:11:25,800 --> 03:11:29,480
before we get to the classical money stuff i had a quick request i am

2581
03:11:29,480 --> 03:11:31,980
granting that she is not dead

2582
03:11:31,980 --> 03:11:33,700
the attitude is not dead

2583
03:11:33,700 --> 03:11:36,760
but that i don't have for what it does tell me but the system is down we're

2584
03:11:36,760 --> 03:11:37,400
going to get

2585
03:11:37,400 --> 03:11:44,400
Boba anyway, so bye.

2586
03:12:07,400 --> 03:12:31,400
The story's ending, like a fairy tale of a life

2587
03:12:31,400 --> 03:12:35,400
It's raining soon and never

2588
03:12:35,400 --> 03:12:38,400
Are fighting in my mind

2589
03:12:38,400 --> 03:12:41,400
I'm losing you

2590
03:12:41,400 --> 03:12:44,400
