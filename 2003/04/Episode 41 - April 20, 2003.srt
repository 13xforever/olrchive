00:00:10,472 --> 00:00:15,534
[SPEAKER_23]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

00:00:33,097 --> 00:00:33,517
[SPEAKER_16]: Just kidding.

8
00:00:33,717 --> 00:00:35,318
[SPEAKER_16]: Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

9
00:00:35,518 --> 00:00:42,961
[SPEAKER_28]: In this episode... Hey, are there any balls down there?

10
00:00:43,241 --> 00:00:45,722
[SPEAKER_22]: That's the biggest fairy you ever seen, Jingle Fairy.

00:00:50,435 --> 00:00:51,315
[SPEAKER_27]: Absolute fright.

00:00:51,835 --> 00:00:52,435
[SPEAKER_27]: What's yours?

00:00:52,675 --> 00:00:55,136
[SPEAKER_27]: There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

16
00:00:55,196 --> 00:00:56,497
[SPEAKER_27]: Don't torture yourself.

17
00:00:57,077 --> 00:00:57,957
[SPEAKER_27]: That's my job.

18
00:00:58,037 --> 00:01:00,018
[SPEAKER_28]: Now's the time when Sprockets made me dogs!

19
00:01:00,758 --> 00:01:04,540
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too.

20
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,820
[SPEAKER_27]: I know Kung Fu.

21
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,541
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

22
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:10,702
[SPEAKER_27]: Why did they have to take the word gang?

23
00:01:11,562 --> 00:01:14,763
[SPEAKER_04]: No one expects us to punish exposition!

24
00:01:15,063 --> 00:01:16,004

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:21,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's my gun?

27
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:23,669
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my boomstick!

28
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,650
[SPEAKER_16]: Sky, Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!

29
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,672
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.

30
00:01:30,752 --> 00:01:33,532
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of warping being would find that funny?

31
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,173

35
00:01:51,037 --> 00:01:52,138
[SPEAKER_04]: That was bad.

36
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:55,721
[SPEAKER_16]: I came up with that joke all by myself.

37
00:01:56,201 --> 00:01:56,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Hand.

38
00:01:58,063 --> 00:01:58,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Ow.

00:01:59,224 --> 00:02:00,044

[SPEAKER_16]: He rocks even more in freaking manga.

55
00:11:09,344 --> 00:11:13,545
[SPEAKER_16]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 41, April the 20th of 2003.

00:11:14,626 --> 00:11:19,908
[SPEAKER_16]: Happy Easter to all you kids out there listening, and if you aren't down with Easter, then happy Sunday to you.

57
00:11:20,248 --> 00:11:22,950
[SPEAKER_13]: I totally forgot it was Easter, that's why the arcade was empty.

58
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,010
[SPEAKER_16]: You didn't do anything today?

59
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:24,970
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

60
00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:29,552
[SPEAKER_16]: I went over to my parents' house and had a little ham, and that was it.

61
00:11:30,193 --> 00:11:34,054
[SPEAKER_13]: We had ham a week ago, so I just ate food.

62
00:11:34,655 --> 00:11:35,315
[SPEAKER_16]: Just ate food.

63
00:11:37,345 --> 00:11:39,366

00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:42,347

66
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:44,127
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

67
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:45,708
[SPEAKER_16]: Because your birthday was yesterday.

68
00:11:46,868 --> 00:11:47,268
Thank you.

69
00:11:47,728 --> 00:11:49,048
[SPEAKER_16]: And how did you celebrate?

70
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:50,289
[SPEAKER_06]: I killed people.

71
00:11:51,369 --> 00:11:51,929
Oh, wait.

72
00:11:52,289 --> 00:11:52,809
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

73
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:58,331
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to the auction, and I got Legendary Axe for the TurboGrafx.

74
00:11:58,851 --> 00:11:59,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

75
00:12:00,211 --> 00:12:01,872
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't know they made that for TurboGrafx.

76
00:12:02,112 --> 00:12:02,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

77
00:12:03,152 --> 00:12:07,299
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got, um, uh, what was it?

78
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:12,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Some game for the Atari adapter for the ColecoVision.

79
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:14,325
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember what it was.

80
00:12:14,905 --> 00:12:15,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Centipede.

81
00:12:15,906 --> 00:12:16,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, cool.

82
00:12:16,266 --> 00:12:17,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Turns out I already had it.

83
00:12:19,808 --> 00:12:23,151
[SPEAKER_06]: This lovely bit of literature that you gave me.

84
00:12:24,031 --> 00:12:25,973
[SPEAKER_16]: Ah, yes, my present, which are always the best.

85
00:12:25,993 --> 00:12:27,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I'm busy trying to remember.

86
00:12:28,975 --> 00:12:33,198
[SPEAKER_06]: It sucks because I'm so out of practice on my Hiragana that I'm having problems reading some of these names.

87
00:12:33,298 --> 00:12:37,160
[SPEAKER_19]: I haven't gotten anything yet because I had to buy my mom something her birthday's tomorrow.

88
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:38,261
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

89
00:12:38,281 --> 00:12:39,442
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, priorities and all.

90
00:12:40,804 --> 00:12:42,867
[SPEAKER_06]: And you gave me a gift certificate around here.

91
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:45,570
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can go buy my Battle Royale novel when it's in stock.

92
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,873
[SPEAKER_16]: So you can indulge more in that Battle Royale-ness.

93
00:12:50,195 --> 00:12:52,197
[SPEAKER_16]: That big inside joke that just won't die.

94
00:12:52,757 --> 00:12:54,239
[SPEAKER_16]: It's beyond an inside joke at this point.

95
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,041
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lifestyle for some.

96
00:12:56,061 --> 00:12:58,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a really cool card from Brad and Irene.

97
00:12:58,524 --> 00:13:00,406
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of my favorite first...

98
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,163
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my favorite Farside ones is the Many Expressions of the Irish Setter, which are all the same.

99
00:13:09,105 --> 00:13:14,769
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got money from Grandma, which I put in the bank to pay bills because I'm currently not working.

100
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,792
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got lunch from Jessica.

101
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:24,416
[SPEAKER_06]: And she bought me a clip-on desk lamp so that I can not go blind when I draw.

102
00:13:24,816 --> 00:13:25,297
[SPEAKER_16]: Very cool.

103
00:13:26,297 --> 00:13:29,860
[SPEAKER_16]: And I got... You can maybe double and use it with your Game Boy, too, if you want to.

104
00:13:30,498 --> 00:13:31,719
[SPEAKER_06]: My Game Boy has an afterburner.

105
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,782
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I've got an afterburner.

106
00:13:34,902 --> 00:13:36,003
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got lots of ice cream.

107
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,164
[SPEAKER_16]: Ooh, ice cream's always good.

108
00:13:38,345 --> 00:13:39,426
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you have cake and ice cream?

109
00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:40,386
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I didn't have cake.

110
00:13:40,647 --> 00:13:41,667
[SPEAKER_06]: I had brownie and my ice cream.

111
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,289
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, that's close enough to cake.

112
00:13:43,309 --> 00:13:43,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Cake pie!

113
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Cake pie!

114
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:47,973
[SPEAKER_06]: I want ice cream.

115
00:13:48,593 --> 00:13:49,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Julie got me boba.

116
00:13:50,322 --> 00:13:52,182
[SPEAKER_15]: We can go get, let's get ice cream after tonight's show.

117
00:13:52,302 --> 00:13:52,642
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

118
00:13:52,702 --> 00:13:53,403
[SPEAKER_15]: I want ice cream too.

119
00:13:53,423 --> 00:13:54,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to get me ice cream?

120
00:13:54,483 --> 00:13:55,063
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess I can.

121
00:13:55,243 --> 00:13:55,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Woohoo!

122
00:13:55,423 --> 00:13:56,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm broke.

123
00:13:56,343 --> 00:13:57,443
[SPEAKER_15]: See if I didn't spoil you enough.

124
00:13:58,063 --> 00:13:58,584
[SPEAKER_15]: That's alright.

125
00:13:58,804 --> 00:13:59,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I need more ice cream.

126
00:14:00,124 --> 00:14:02,064
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm only looking for cake pie ice cream though.

127
00:14:03,064 --> 00:14:08,065
[SPEAKER_16]: We should take, we should get some cake batter ice cream and some like pumpkin pie ice cream and mix them together.

128
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:08,485
[SPEAKER_16]: Voila!

129
00:14:08,565 --> 00:14:09,286
[SPEAKER_16]: Cake pie ice cream.

130
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,546
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have pumpkin pie ice cream.

131
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:12,386
[SPEAKER_16]: They don't have pumpkin pie ice cream?

132
00:14:12,406 --> 00:14:14,987
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what my favorite is now is getting the cake batter ice cream.

133
00:14:15,007 --> 00:14:15,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh?

134
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Get pumpkin ice cream.

135
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:18,610
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm so fucking hungry!

136
00:14:45,595 --> 00:14:49,037
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite now is the cake batter ice cream with brownie and coconut.

137
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:54,100
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to get cheesecake with graham cracker and cherries.

138
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,462
[SPEAKER_16]: This is like Iron Chef where the secret ingredient is cold stone.

139
00:14:58,282 --> 00:15:03,665
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, do you want to see a really painful way to die?

140
00:15:04,045 --> 00:15:05,666
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, because this will be great radio.

141
00:15:05,826 --> 00:15:07,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't this a great picture of...

142
00:15:08,117 --> 00:15:11,519
[SPEAKER_16]: That's... Oh my god, he looks like Nine in that picture.

143
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,639
[SPEAKER_16]: Or are you talking about the other one?

144
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,300
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, hello.

145
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'm gonna scan this.

146
00:15:14,901 --> 00:15:15,581
[SPEAKER_06]: He's sexy.

147
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:20,104
[SPEAKER_06]: And send pictures of this to everybody here because this is like the best manga ever.

148
00:15:20,564 --> 00:15:21,684
[SPEAKER_06]: It shows this guy here.

149
00:15:21,905 --> 00:15:22,825
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot which one he is.

150
00:15:22,845 --> 00:15:26,507
[SPEAKER_06]: It has this picture of him, of Nimura hugging the younger one to comfort him.

151
00:15:26,987 --> 00:15:29,008
[SPEAKER_06]: And then these bullets going through his face.

152
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:30,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Aww.

153
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,551
[SPEAKER_06]: And like it has the bullet time trail like in, um, what was that game?

154
00:15:34,528 --> 00:15:35,008
[SPEAKER_06]: on PC.

155
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:37,049
[SPEAKER_19]: Dead to Rights.

156
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:38,210
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

157
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Where he'd go into bullet time and he'd dodge all the bullets.

158
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:41,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Dead to Rights.

159
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:42,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Max Payne.

160
00:15:42,392 --> 00:15:43,032
[SPEAKER_13]: Max Payne.

161
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:43,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Max Payne.

162
00:15:43,953 --> 00:15:47,414
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I have to say about that?

163
00:15:47,454 --> 00:15:47,995
[SPEAKER_06]: He looks like Big Boy.

164
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:48,855
[SPEAKER_13]: Death to Frodo.

165
00:15:49,175 --> 00:15:50,055
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what it looks like.

166
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:51,996
[SPEAKER_13]: Death to Frodo.

167
00:15:52,777 --> 00:15:53,677
[SPEAKER_04]: He does look like Frodo.

168
00:15:55,918 --> 00:16:00,060
[SPEAKER_06]: And look, when he falls on the ground, his head busts open and there's brains all over the place.

169
00:16:01,181 --> 00:16:01,221
Ew.

170
00:16:02,213 --> 00:16:07,937
[SPEAKER_06]: and he got shot across his belly and his intestines start coming out so he freaking duct tapes them back in.

171
00:16:08,437 --> 00:16:09,117
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, nasty.

172
00:16:09,258 --> 00:16:10,999
[SPEAKER_16]: Are they ever going to make a Battle Royale video game?

173
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:12,099
[SPEAKER_16]: Why don't they?

174
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:12,900
[SPEAKER_06]: They should.

175
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,101
[SPEAKER_16]: Why don't they?

176
00:16:14,401 --> 00:16:17,002
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we suck.

177
00:16:17,222 --> 00:16:19,104
[SPEAKER_16]: They won't make a video game because we suck.

178
00:16:19,744 --> 00:16:22,886
[SPEAKER_13]: Damn right, because the stupid Americans get offended by everything.

179
00:16:23,206 --> 00:16:24,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, it's red!

180
00:16:24,687 --> 00:16:26,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Which insinuates blood!

181
00:16:26,388 --> 00:16:27,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is bad!

182
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:30,531
[SPEAKER_06]: As he's bleeding to death, he wires a bomb.

183
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:32,564
[SPEAKER_06]: This is so cool.

184
00:16:34,185 --> 00:16:36,205
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if I'm going to regret buying that for Jamie.

185
00:16:36,305 --> 00:16:37,726
[SPEAKER_06]: She might come up with too many ideas.

186
00:16:38,086 --> 00:16:39,626
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he tries to pull up Kiriyama.

187
00:16:39,706 --> 00:16:41,787
[SPEAKER_06]: And Kiriyama, by the way, looks like the Uber Bishonen.

188
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:45,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of looking like the Japanese guy who's not.

189
00:16:45,908 --> 00:16:50,369
[SPEAKER_16]: If you hear of any large explosions in the Sacramento area, I've never met Jamie.

190
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:51,409
[SPEAKER_16]: Never knew her.

191
00:16:54,037 --> 00:16:54,478
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyways.

192
00:16:57,802 --> 00:16:59,985
[SPEAKER_16]: So, orders of business tonight.

193
00:17:00,526 --> 00:17:05,833
[SPEAKER_16]: As you may or may not know, tonight, ladies and gentlemen, is the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

194
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:08,437
[SPEAKER_16]: In this studio.

195
00:17:10,936 --> 00:17:14,160
[SPEAKER_16]: Just had to get him going for a minute.

196
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:23,852
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, tonight's the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio in this studio, in this lovely little house that I'm in right now in Orange Lounge World headquarters in Citrus Heights, to be specific, California.

197
00:17:23,932 --> 00:17:26,636
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the last one here because we're going to have Battle Royale here tomorrow.

198
00:17:28,908 --> 00:17:31,391
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll invite a bunch of people that I don't like and then I'll kill them.

199
00:17:32,673 --> 00:17:33,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I'll die.

200
00:17:34,035 --> 00:17:36,698
[SPEAKER_15]: So, we have the chat room going for a minute.

201
00:17:36,718 --> 00:17:37,560
[SPEAKER_15]: They're all, no!

202
00:17:38,561 --> 00:17:39,102
[SPEAKER_15]: I love lag.

203
00:17:39,843 --> 00:17:42,706
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, actually it's... Haha, fooled you!

204
00:17:44,108 --> 00:17:44,969
[SPEAKER_16]: We got a lame alert.

205
00:17:46,591 --> 00:17:50,696
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, what's going to happen, next week's show, okay, what's happening next Saturday is the big move.

206
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,159
[SPEAKER_16]: And what's happening is I'm moving out of the house I'm in right now.

207
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,845
[SPEAKER_16]: And I got to give a big thank you on the show, even though he's not listening right now to Brian, my current roommate.

208
00:17:58,865 --> 00:18:00,107
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if he is listening.

209
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:00,447
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

210
00:18:00,808 --> 00:18:02,149
[SPEAKER_16]: But he's put up with a lot of crap.

211
00:18:03,925 --> 00:18:04,465
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

212
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:30,250
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll have the computer set up.

213
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,591
[SPEAKER_16]: That's like priority number one.

214
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:32,812
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't live without my computer.

215
00:18:32,832 --> 00:18:34,193
[SPEAKER_16]: You said we might not have the internet in time.

216
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:34,813
[SPEAKER_16]: That's my problem.

217
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,435
[SPEAKER_16]: You have the computer set up and there might not be an internet.

218
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:36,615
[SPEAKER_16]: Why?

219
00:18:36,755 --> 00:18:38,336
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to call this week and get it set up.

220
00:18:38,356 --> 00:18:39,517
[SPEAKER_16]: I know, I know, I know.

221
00:18:39,557 --> 00:18:42,359
[SPEAKER_16]: They might not come out until Monday or Tuesday if they're not open on the weekend.

222
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,460
[SPEAKER_13]: I have to dial up.

223
00:18:43,781 --> 00:18:44,781
[SPEAKER_13]: I still have my internet.

224
00:18:44,841 --> 00:18:45,862
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll figure something out.

225
00:18:46,062 --> 00:18:46,703
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll figure something out.

226
00:18:47,223 --> 00:18:50,146
[SPEAKER_16]: But bare minimum, there'll be a tape show next week.

227
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:52,908
[SPEAKER_15]: There'll be some kind of show, new show this Sunday.

228
00:18:53,268 --> 00:18:53,969
[SPEAKER_15]: And then after that...

229
00:18:55,587 --> 00:18:57,168
[SPEAKER_16]: New show, that'll be interesting.

230
00:18:57,949 --> 00:18:59,350
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get you a stripper.

231
00:19:00,731 --> 00:19:06,255
[SPEAKER_16]: My birthday's coming up, and this is a big one, because I'm 25 this year.

232
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,857
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't believe I just gave my age over here, God.

233
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:14,501
[SPEAKER_16]: Now I'm like, I just placed myself in that, I'm an over 20 DDR player.

234
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:20,445
[SPEAKER_06]: I was very happy because the guy at Coldstone, first of all, Julie made them sing to me.

235
00:19:21,838 --> 00:19:24,218
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to die.

236
00:19:24,258 --> 00:19:31,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Secondly, the guy behind the counter, in all seriousness, because I looked to be sure, asked me if I was turning 18.

237
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,521
[SPEAKER_16]: I was like... Did you get carded to an R-rated movie?

238
00:19:35,961 --> 00:19:38,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, that's not funny.

239
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:40,101
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not funny at all.

240
00:19:40,461 --> 00:19:43,082
[SPEAKER_19]: Stupid freaking dead man at Campus Chico Theater.

241
00:19:43,222 --> 00:19:43,862
[SPEAKER_19]: You suck.

242
00:19:44,582 --> 00:19:47,663
[SPEAKER_06]: At least he didn't ask for my... Hi, can I speak to your mommy?

243
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:49,323
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you can't fucking talk to my mommy.

244
00:19:50,157 --> 00:19:52,678
[SPEAKER_16]: Why would the Coldstone guy want to talk to your mommy?

245
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:53,359
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

246
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,102
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I don't mind when I'm looking face-to-face with someone.

247
00:19:58,482 --> 00:20:00,323
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, little girl, I bet your mommy's pretty hot.

248
00:20:01,343 --> 00:20:01,804
[SPEAKER_15]: What the hell?

249
00:20:01,824 --> 00:20:02,944
[SPEAKER_15]: Why would he want to see your mommy?

250
00:20:03,344 --> 00:20:05,085
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm talking to him.

251
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:05,366
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

252
00:20:05,486 --> 00:20:05,906
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

253
00:20:09,868 --> 00:20:12,690
[SPEAKER_06]: But I told him to die, go to hell, and opt me off his mailing list.

254
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:16,352
[SPEAKER_19]: That'd be like, you know, some guy going, hey, I bet your mom's pretty hot.

255
00:20:16,392 --> 00:20:16,992
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, she's dead.

256
00:20:17,152 --> 00:20:17,512
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, good.

257
00:20:17,532 --> 00:20:18,313
[SPEAKER_19]: Then she can't say no.

258
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:22,819
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki's unpolitically correct.

259
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:23,899
[SPEAKER_16]: Statement of the night, thank you.

260
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,880
[SPEAKER_06]: I screw political correctness.

261
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,620
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an excuse.

262
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,480
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a crutch.

263
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,461
[SPEAKER_15]: Back to the story of the moving in Orange Lounge Radio.

264
00:20:32,241 --> 00:20:35,662
[SPEAKER_15]: So in two weeks, we'll be coming to you from our brand new studio.

265
00:20:35,722 --> 00:20:36,542
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be freeloading.

266
00:20:37,022 --> 00:20:37,822
[SPEAKER_15]: Our brand new studio.

267
00:20:37,882 --> 00:20:40,923
[SPEAKER_15]: If there's a problem, though, maybe we can... You can pay for my gas.

268
00:20:42,363 --> 00:20:47,504
[SPEAKER_16]: If there happens to be a problem, maybe we can convince Jamie to do Studio Jamie for a night, which would be fine.

269
00:20:47,764 --> 00:20:47,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

270
00:20:48,044 --> 00:20:48,984
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be there, too.

271
00:20:50,003 --> 00:20:56,164
[SPEAKER_16]: I know, but if something happens and our internet's not up by then, we might have to do that show at your house.

272
00:20:56,904 --> 00:20:57,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, broadcast?

273
00:20:57,845 --> 00:20:58,845
[SPEAKER_06]: If something happens, yes.

274
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:03,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess no Xbox Live for Dan that night.

275
00:21:03,746 --> 00:21:04,566
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we'll figure something out.

276
00:21:04,626 --> 00:21:06,506
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm pretty sure the internet will be up for us by then.

277
00:21:06,546 --> 00:21:08,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, darn, I was going to leave it on PSO.

278
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:10,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Logged in, sitting there.

279
00:21:11,947 --> 00:21:14,768
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really funny to go on PSO and just stand there and have people talk to you.

280
00:21:16,812 --> 00:21:17,492
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you done that?

281
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,473
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you watch people talk to you?

282
00:21:19,573 --> 00:21:20,853
[SPEAKER_06]: People come up, what level?

283
00:21:21,353 --> 00:21:22,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Dot, dot, dot, dot.

284
00:21:23,754 --> 00:21:25,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, dot, dot, dot.

285
00:21:25,454 --> 00:21:27,555
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what people do on PSO that I find hilarious?

286
00:21:27,915 --> 00:21:31,256
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, I went on PSO one night, and this guy was just running in a circle.

287
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,456
[SPEAKER_16]: He just ran in a circle around the lobby.

288
00:21:33,756 --> 00:21:35,216
[SPEAKER_16]: He just kept running in a circle.

289
00:21:35,797 --> 00:21:37,957
[SPEAKER_16]: And then, like, people would try to talk to him, and he just kept running.

290
00:21:38,237 --> 00:21:38,857
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, he did that.

291
00:21:38,917 --> 00:21:42,258
[SPEAKER_16]: I swear to God, I would sit there for ten minutes and watch this guy just keep running in a circle.

292
00:21:42,878 --> 00:21:45,259
[SPEAKER_16]: And then, finally, some guy started running behind him.

293
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:45,619
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

294
00:21:47,196 --> 00:21:51,817
[SPEAKER_15]: and pretty soon I got in on it too and then like six of us were all running in a giant circle.

295
00:21:52,098 --> 00:21:55,158
[SPEAKER_15]: It was like a big fucking PSO conga line.

296
00:21:55,218 --> 00:21:57,479
[SPEAKER_16]: It was like the nerdiest thing I'd ever seen in my entire life.

297
00:21:57,499 --> 00:22:04,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of online games, and this only goes out to the smart people, which are basically all of our listeners are smart because they're listening to us.

298
00:22:05,462 --> 00:22:16,505
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go to SquareEnixUSA.com you can sign up, you can register to beta test Final Fantasy XI for PC or PS2.

299
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:25,092
[SPEAKER_06]: PS2, that's funny I know, that's a hilarious joke I signed up for the PC one

300
00:22:26,284 --> 00:22:27,565
[SPEAKER_16]: Because you know what?

301
00:22:28,526 --> 00:22:33,450
[SPEAKER_06]: When Final Fantasy XI came out, first of all, my first impression was this is the biggest pile of suck there could be.

302
00:22:34,971 --> 00:22:36,993
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the other thing was, I want to play it.

303
00:22:37,113 --> 00:22:40,196
[SPEAKER_06]: If I get Final Fantasy XI, I have to have a hard drive.

304
00:22:40,256 --> 00:22:44,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I can convince Dan to work that into the bills, get a hard drive for my PC.

305
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,661
[SPEAKER_13]: Why can't they just, you know what they should do?

306
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:49,764
[SPEAKER_13]: Square should just say, okay... Squeenix.

307
00:22:49,904 --> 00:22:54,668
[SPEAKER_13]: Squeenix should just say, okay, you know, this game really sucked ass.

308
00:22:55,308 --> 00:22:57,709
[SPEAKER_13]: Maxis, what can we do to make this game better?

309
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Put it on PC.

310
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:04,073
[SPEAKER_13]: No, fucking we need Sims mixed with, you know, Final Fantasy.

311
00:23:04,373 --> 00:23:04,853
[SPEAKER_13]: It's awesome.

312
00:23:04,913 --> 00:23:05,713
[SPEAKER_13]: Sims is addicting.

313
00:23:05,753 --> 00:23:06,314
[SPEAKER_13]: People love it.

314
00:23:06,354 --> 00:23:09,255
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, they love creating shit, making new skins and all that crap.

315
00:23:09,675 --> 00:23:14,398
[SPEAKER_13]: But just, you know, with Final Fantasy, you have a little bit of fighting, a little bit of this, a little bit of that.

316
00:23:14,638 --> 00:23:15,398
[SPEAKER_13]: It sounds good.

317
00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:15,939
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

318
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:17,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy X was good.

319
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn it.

320
00:23:19,501 --> 00:23:21,001
[SPEAKER_06]: They're remaking all these Final Fantasy games.

321
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:23,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't they remake Final Fantasy VI and CG-lock for me?

322
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,141
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be cool.

323
00:23:26,221 --> 00:23:26,681
[SPEAKER_06]: And Shadow.

324
00:23:48,477 --> 00:23:51,038
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think she died in the video, no.

325
00:23:51,058 --> 00:23:52,739
[SPEAKER_16]: She gets attacked by, like, butterflies.

326
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:53,799
[SPEAKER_16]: I might have to see that.

327
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:56,840
[SPEAKER_16]: She doesn't really get attacked, it's supposed to be her coming out of her cocoon.

328
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,480
[SPEAKER_16]: Symbolic crap.

329
00:24:19,557 --> 00:24:22,099
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to know about her.

330
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:25,281
[SPEAKER_16]: She's going in as a crack whore and coming out crack whore.

331
00:24:26,602 --> 00:24:28,963
[SPEAKER_06]: No, she's going in as a crack whore.

332
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:30,524
[SPEAKER_06]: That means people pay for her.

333
00:24:31,405 --> 00:24:33,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming out as crack slut.

334
00:24:33,686 --> 00:24:34,727
[SPEAKER_06]: No one wants to pay for her.

335
00:24:34,747 --> 00:24:42,031
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to think of how many diseases you would catch.

336
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:46,034
[SPEAKER_19]: That's where the full body condom comes into play.

337
00:24:46,054 --> 00:24:47,695
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

338
00:24:48,263 --> 00:25:04,143
[SPEAKER_16]: So yeah, Orange Lounge Radio, going to be a new studio in the new world headquarters in Folsom, California with a scenic view of Folsom State Prison.

339
00:25:06,704 --> 00:25:07,464
[SPEAKER_16]: Coming to you in two weeks.

340
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:35,938
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, come over, we live right by the damn road.

341
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,905
[SPEAKER_06]: When my brother was little, when I went to Arizona to visit my mom, we went to Vegas.

342
00:25:43,545 --> 00:25:46,207
[SPEAKER_06]: My brother seriously would call it the Hoover Darn.

343
00:25:47,328 --> 00:25:49,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Because damn is a bad word.

344
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:51,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, oh gee!

345
00:25:52,613 --> 00:25:53,594
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a bad word.

346
00:25:53,934 --> 00:25:58,939
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to have so much shit wired in that new... I have good news, by the way.

347
00:25:59,159 --> 00:25:59,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes?

348
00:25:59,779 --> 00:26:01,381
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say this right now because I brought up my brother.

349
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:02,941
[SPEAKER_06]: I love him anyway.

350
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:29,474
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I always thought the Marines were like this elite fighting force, yet you keep hearing more and more and more and more and more of them, you know, being made.

351
00:26:29,694 --> 00:26:32,736
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know, are they just like... Because they're on the front.

352
00:26:33,576 --> 00:26:34,117
[SPEAKER_16]: They're the front.

353
00:26:34,337 --> 00:26:34,937
[SPEAKER_16]: So they're first.

354
00:26:35,117 --> 00:26:36,058
[SPEAKER_16]: First in, first out.

355
00:26:40,592 --> 00:26:41,632
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't believe you said that.

356
00:26:43,553 --> 00:26:44,753
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a South Park reference.

357
00:26:44,793 --> 00:26:45,214
[SPEAKER_06]: It's loud.

358
00:26:48,615 --> 00:26:51,476
[SPEAKER_16]: What's interesting is that, you know, one goes out and another goes in.

359
00:26:51,536 --> 00:26:54,137
[SPEAKER_16]: Our friend, the other Jamie, we know, is going in.

360
00:26:55,017 --> 00:26:55,977
[SPEAKER_16]: As one goes out, one goes in.

361
00:26:56,938 --> 00:27:00,259
[SPEAKER_16]: Hope they don't make her do too many push-ups, but, you know, does the body good.

362
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:06,501
[SPEAKER_06]: I stayed away from the military, and I'm glad that, you know, as horrible as it is,

363
00:27:06,881 --> 00:27:09,282
[SPEAKER_06]: to be run over at 13 and have your leg put back on.

364
00:27:10,043 --> 00:27:14,545
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad that Dan was run over and had his leg put back on because there's no possible way he could ever serve in the military.

365
00:27:15,846 --> 00:27:19,488
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what's interesting, and this has absolutely nothing to do with our show, but whatever, who cares.

366
00:27:19,508 --> 00:27:20,148
[SPEAKER_16]: Porn.

367
00:27:20,588 --> 00:27:21,309
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, porn, no.

368
00:27:21,329 --> 00:27:21,689
[SPEAKER_16]: It's funny.

369
00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:23,950
[SPEAKER_16]: No, this is about my dad, not porn, God.

370
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:24,750
[SPEAKER_16]: Ew.

371
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:31,314
[SPEAKER_16]: My dad was not able to go to the Korean, my dad's a little bit older than probably a lot of your daddies, he was going to go to the Korean War.

372
00:27:32,454 --> 00:27:35,716
[SPEAKER_16]: And they sent him home because he has an extra vertebrae.

373
00:27:37,338 --> 00:27:37,738
[SPEAKER_13]: Whoa.

374
00:27:38,819 --> 00:27:39,839
[SPEAKER_13]: I would think he'd be in there.

375
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:42,340
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, damn, man, if he gets hurt, take one out.

376
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,020
[SPEAKER_13]: He's normal.

377
00:27:43,601 --> 00:27:45,221
[SPEAKER_16]: It makes me wonder, though, if I got that.

378
00:27:45,321 --> 00:27:46,462
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, I need to have somebody count.

379
00:27:46,522 --> 00:27:48,783
[SPEAKER_16]: I've never had a doctor count, like, see if I have extra vertebrae.

380
00:27:48,803 --> 00:27:49,923
[SPEAKER_19]: You're supposed to have a certain amount.

381
00:27:49,963 --> 00:27:51,124
[SPEAKER_19]: I just thought they were just there.

382
00:27:51,144 --> 00:27:51,624
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

383
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:53,025
[SPEAKER_16]: Crazy, huh?

384
00:27:54,525 --> 00:27:55,005
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

385
00:27:55,686 --> 00:27:56,426
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's all count.

386
00:27:58,047 --> 00:27:59,207
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me take my shirt off.

387
00:27:59,227 --> 00:28:00,948
[SPEAKER_19]: I recommend that you do this while you're driving.

388
00:28:01,268 --> 00:28:02,108
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just awesome.

389
00:28:02,929 --> 00:28:04,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, keep your shirt on.

390
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:05,710
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen you in a corset.

391
00:28:06,553 --> 00:28:07,674
[SPEAKER_19]: So have I, unfortunately.

392
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:13,979
[SPEAKER_19]: So have I. Thank God it's a radio show, because I'm wearing it right now.

393
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,183
[SPEAKER_13]: I was bored one day, and I was just browsing the internet.

394
00:28:18,203 --> 00:28:19,704
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, you know, I'll read live journals.

395
00:28:19,724 --> 00:28:22,887
[SPEAKER_13]: I read live journals, saw a link to the site, saw the pictures.

396
00:28:22,907 --> 00:28:24,929
[SPEAKER_13]: But actually, you know what's funny?

397
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:28,572
[SPEAKER_13]: My friend Sean thinks he knows you.

398
00:28:28,852 --> 00:28:31,454
[SPEAKER_13]: Because he used to do Rocky down at the Birdcage.

399
00:28:32,295 --> 00:28:33,036
[SPEAKER_06]: You think you know him?

400
00:28:33,436 --> 00:28:34,317
[SPEAKER_13]: And he thinks he knows you, too.

401
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,380
[SPEAKER_06]: I never did Rocky.

402
00:28:36,821 --> 00:28:37,381
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, you never did Rocky.

403
00:28:37,441 --> 00:28:38,521
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, he doesn't know you then.

404
00:28:38,741 --> 00:28:39,882
[SPEAKER_19]: He knows Jessica, maybe.

405
00:28:40,182 --> 00:28:40,482
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

406
00:28:42,383 --> 00:28:46,905
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll talk off air, because I bet our listeners really don't give a shit.

407
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,625
[SPEAKER_06]: See, me, I did conventions.

408
00:28:49,146 --> 00:28:50,166
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a cosplayer.

409
00:28:53,007 --> 00:28:54,088
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay!

410
00:28:54,268 --> 00:28:54,528
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

411
00:28:54,668 --> 00:28:55,048
[SPEAKER_16]: So?

412
00:28:55,328 --> 00:28:55,988
[SPEAKER_16]: What's the point?

413
00:28:56,028 --> 00:28:56,909
[SPEAKER_16]: What's the point?

414
00:28:56,949 --> 00:29:02,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that means I'm going to go around and kill people, because cosplayers eventually go psycho, because one little thing goes wrong, and they go around killing everyone.

415
00:29:03,511 --> 00:29:03,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really.

416
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,920
[SPEAKER_06]: I need a machete.

417
00:29:12,101 --> 00:29:12,842
[SPEAKER_16]: You need a machete?

418
00:29:12,882 --> 00:29:12,942
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

419
00:29:13,362 --> 00:29:13,622
[SPEAKER_16]: Why?

420
00:29:14,643 --> 00:29:15,724
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm starting customer service.

421
00:29:16,944 --> 00:29:18,325
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, your job starts tomorrow, huh?

422
00:29:18,405 --> 00:29:20,627
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it starts next Monday.

423
00:29:21,868 --> 00:29:25,610
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, good, we have another week of fuck-off shows on Orange Lounge Radio that go until 5 in the morning.

424
00:29:26,451 --> 00:29:28,612
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.

425
00:29:29,213 --> 00:29:37,158
[SPEAKER_06]: See, me staying up until 5 in the morning and then waking up at 7 a.m., going back to sleep,

426
00:29:38,507 --> 00:29:40,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Getting up at 10am, going back to sleep.

427
00:29:41,569 --> 00:29:44,790
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't do this business of staying up until 8 in the morning.

428
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I was staying up until 8 in the morning on average.

429
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:51,834
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what, last night I went to bed and the sun was coming up and I was like, God, I haven't done this in a long time.

430
00:29:51,914 --> 00:29:52,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Bob?

431
00:29:52,554 --> 00:29:52,834
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah?

432
00:29:53,215 --> 00:29:55,556
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to bed when the sun was already high overhead.

433
00:29:57,017 --> 00:29:58,958
[SPEAKER_06]: So I did something really stupid.

434
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:04,500
[SPEAKER_06]: I stayed up all day and all night.

435
00:30:04,841 --> 00:30:07,422
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was inspired to write lots of fun stuff too.

436
00:30:08,246 --> 00:30:08,526
[SPEAKER_15]: Really?

437
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:11,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I didn't write a damn thing.

438
00:30:11,627 --> 00:30:13,528
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I'm lazy.

439
00:30:14,108 --> 00:30:20,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Every time I start typing, I'd be like, why did I just type in Russian?

440
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:26,333
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the most entertaining thing to do is you start typing and you start writing something and you're really, really tired.

441
00:30:26,614 --> 00:30:28,814
[SPEAKER_19]: And then you go back and read it and you're like, what the hell?

442
00:30:28,895 --> 00:30:31,656
[SPEAKER_06]: No, when I'm sleep deprived, I make the funniest typos.

443
00:30:31,736 --> 00:30:32,136
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.

444
00:30:32,496 --> 00:30:34,697
[SPEAKER_06]: I started keeping a log of my typos.

445
00:30:37,543 --> 00:30:38,844
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a breaking news announcement.

446
00:30:39,844 --> 00:30:42,825
[SPEAKER_16]: ViolentHyperGirl, you may know her from Fremont 2.

447
00:30:43,126 --> 00:30:46,027
[SPEAKER_16]: She was the one, if you've seen pictures from the Fremont 2 tournament, she was whipping me.

448
00:30:47,127 --> 00:30:49,408
[SPEAKER_16]: She is coming to Davis for college.

449
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:53,770
[SPEAKER_16]: Which means Puppy has someone to play with so he won't get so bored.

450
00:30:54,671 --> 00:30:55,951
[SPEAKER_16]: And somebody to meet us for Boba.

451
00:30:56,392 --> 00:30:57,092
[SPEAKER_16]: But guess what?

452
00:30:57,752 --> 00:30:59,773
[SPEAKER_16]: I am getting another breaking news.

453
00:31:00,173 --> 00:31:01,874
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a TapX in Sacramento now.

454
00:31:02,054 --> 00:31:02,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Where?

455
00:31:03,015 --> 00:31:04,635
[SPEAKER_16]: Pocket Road in a shopping center.

456
00:31:04,675 --> 00:31:05,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Where the hell is Pocket Road?

457
00:31:05,576 --> 00:31:05,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that

458
00:31:06,846 --> 00:31:07,989
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it's South Sac somewhere.

459
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:12,278
[SPEAKER_16]: So Skyline, find the address and give it to us now.

460
00:31:12,318 --> 00:31:13,581
[SPEAKER_06]: We are going now.

461
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:14,964
[SPEAKER_06]: I just hit my knee.

462
00:31:15,485 --> 00:31:16,447
I hit my head.

463
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:22,815
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um, as Dark Tetsuya said earlier, is this going to be one of those shows?

464
00:31:22,895 --> 00:31:24,396
[SPEAKER_15]: It's always one of those shows.

465
00:31:25,037 --> 00:31:27,980
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, we can talk about Bomani News, and I'll make it quick.

466
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,384
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, well, no, let's take a break before we do the news.

467
00:31:32,404 --> 00:31:33,325
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got to tease the news.

468
00:31:33,345 --> 00:31:33,966
[SPEAKER_19]: Tease the news.

469
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:34,987
[SPEAKER_15]: Tease the news.

00:31:38,811 --> 00:31:39,352
[SPEAKER_19]: I was teasing.

472
00:31:39,532 --> 00:31:40,654
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought you were going to go in the song.

473
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:41,035
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

474
00:31:41,415 --> 00:31:42,397
[SPEAKER_19]: We need to be, you know.

475
00:31:42,938 --> 00:31:47,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, as soon as our, like, you know, other people arrive, we can do listless.

476
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:49,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we have a special one.

477
00:31:51,852 --> 00:31:52,993
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, we can tease this.

478
00:31:53,133 --> 00:31:55,935
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to play, I don't know the quality of this mp3, I just got it.

479
00:31:55,975 --> 00:31:56,476
[SPEAKER_16]: It's crap!

480
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,777
[SPEAKER_19]: But you can, yeah, it's mp3.

481
00:31:58,937 --> 00:31:59,398
[SPEAKER_16]: It's crap, though.

482
00:31:59,478 --> 00:32:00,979
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, it's a crap one, but we'll try it.

483
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:01,860
[SPEAKER_16]: It's from Guitar Freaks.

484
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,720
[SPEAKER_16]: This is one of the Guitar Freaks.

485
00:32:03,301 --> 00:32:04,001
[SPEAKER_02]: These are pretty good.

486
00:32:04,161 --> 00:32:04,602
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, good.

487
00:32:04,962 --> 00:32:08,585
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the brand new B4U song from Guitar Freaks 9th and Drum Mania 8th.

488
00:32:09,926 --> 00:32:10,987
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll see if it's any good or not.

489
00:32:11,027 --> 00:32:12,688
[SPEAKER_16]: Chikara, I haven't heard this yet.

490
00:32:12,948 --> 00:32:13,368

[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Mississippi orgy.

534
00:42:06,372 --> 00:42:08,534
[SPEAKER_15]: We had a Mississippi orgy at my house the other night.

535
00:42:08,574 --> 00:42:09,414
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we killed each other.

536
00:42:09,434 --> 00:42:12,936
[SPEAKER_06]: With paper plates and magic markers and candles.

537
00:42:13,377 --> 00:42:20,361

00:42:24,164 --> 00:42:27,926
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a Java chat, there's an IRC chat, whatever you need to do to get in the room.

00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:32,949
[SPEAKER_19]: We've already gone over this.

557
00:43:34,349 --> 00:43:36,570
[SPEAKER_15]: That's still laughing.

558
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:45,572
[SPEAKER_15]: I watched a show called Blister, I think it was, with this guy who thought he was funny, who wasn't.

559
00:43:46,392 --> 00:43:48,513
[SPEAKER_16]: And what was the other show I watched?

560
00:43:48,533 --> 00:43:49,293
[SPEAKER_16]: Something called Cheat.

561
00:43:49,553 --> 00:43:50,173

565
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:04,280
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the funny thing, though.

566
00:44:05,522 --> 00:44:09,105
[SPEAKER_15]: They didn't get a... Jamie, is your mic on?

567

00:44:15,431 --> 00:44:16,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Go back to the thingy.

571
00:44:16,292 --> 00:44:16,813
[SPEAKER_16]: That's weird.

572
00:44:17,994 --> 00:44:19,315
[SPEAKER_16]: They asked what you got a zing for.

573
00:44:19,395 --> 00:44:20,156
[SPEAKER_16]: Nobody heard that?

574
00:44:23,058 --> 00:44:24,199
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess you guys weren't listening.

575
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, fuck y'all.

576
00:44:27,323 --> 00:44:27,944
[SPEAKER_15]: Not really.

577
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:28,965
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's reenact.

578
00:44:29,445 --> 00:44:32,729
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, Jamie, guess what I saw for the first time today?

[SPEAKER_15]: You got me.

582
00:44:36,033 --> 00:44:36,514
[SPEAKER_15]: You bitch.

583
00:44:37,195 --> 00:44:37,515
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

584
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:43,587
[SPEAKER_16]: Speak up, my ass.

585
00:44:43,607 --> 00:44:45,308
[SPEAKER_16]: We're running through the fucking mixing board.

586
00:44:45,508 --> 00:44:46,529
[SPEAKER_16]: No one has to speak up.

587
00:44:47,069 --> 00:44:49,210
[SPEAKER_16]: You turn your damn speakers up, okay?

588
00:44:49,531 --> 00:44:51,712
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to speak up, my ass.

589
00:44:51,812 --> 00:44:52,132
[SPEAKER_16]: Rant.

590
00:44:53,132 --> 00:44:54,073
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, oh, doorbell.

591
00:44:54,953 --> 00:44:57,155
[SPEAKER_16]: G4, really quick, because I know we have news we want to get to.

592
00:44:58,115 --> 00:44:58,936
[SPEAKER_16]: It was interesting.

593
00:44:59,076 --> 00:44:59,916
[SPEAKER_16]: Why aren't we on G4?

594
00:45:00,076 --> 00:45:01,877
[SPEAKER_16]: Our show would work on G4.

595
00:45:02,117 --> 00:45:03,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we don't suck.

596
00:45:05,059 --> 00:45:06,239
[SPEAKER_16]: I wouldn't say G4 sucks.

597
00:45:06,259 --> 00:45:06,860
[SPEAKER_16]: They're just new.

598
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,460
[SPEAKER_16]: They're in their infancy.

599
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,381
[SPEAKER_06]: We need the next channel, G5.

600
00:45:11,044 --> 00:45:11,884
[SPEAKER_16]: I want G69.

601

[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, Irene's here.

602
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:20,353
[SPEAKER_16]: And how dare they name that channel after a really shitty Macintosh computer.

603
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:21,394
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what I want to know.

604
00:45:22,616 --> 00:45:25,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it just you or is Brad with you?

605
00:45:27,721 --> 00:45:28,001
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, okay.

606
00:45:28,382 --> 00:45:28,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

607
00:45:34,062 --> 00:45:37,348
[SPEAKER_16]: Promises that we do Bomani news when we come back to this break.

608
00:45:37,388 --> 00:45:40,594
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'll hand it off to Loki because he always has something to say Bomani related.

611
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:15,534
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically, you get an update every Thursday or Friday, I believe, on their Max2 site.

612
00:46:15,554 --> 00:46:16,334
[SPEAKER_13]: They update it every week.

613
00:46:16,654 --> 00:46:20,015
[SPEAKER_13]: And supposedly, this coming up week will be new codes for DDR Extreme.

614
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:24,417
[SPEAKER_13]: Supposedly, it'll be the last codes, but who really gives a shit?

615
00:46:27,778 --> 00:46:28,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking roulette.

616
00:46:29,278 --> 00:46:29,998
[SPEAKER_13]: Fucking roulette.

617
00:46:30,098 --> 00:46:31,319
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate your roulette.

618
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:32,979
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'll get into that later.

619
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it's not time for the fuckies of the week.

620
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:35,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

621
00:46:38,325 --> 00:46:39,085
[SPEAKER_13]: Jam and Marmalade.

622
00:46:39,165 --> 00:46:39,346
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

623
00:46:39,366 --> 00:46:42,227
[SPEAKER_13]: Paranoia Survivor.

624
00:46:42,247 --> 00:46:42,827
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't read anything.

625
00:46:42,947 --> 00:46:43,188
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah.

626
00:46:43,428 --> 00:46:44,949
[SPEAKER_13]: It's rumored to be on there, I think.

627
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:45,509
[SPEAKER_13]: Or no.

628
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:47,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, more Paranoia.

629
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:47,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

630
00:46:49,211 --> 00:46:49,451
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

631
00:46:50,612 --> 00:46:53,333
[SPEAKER_16]: Paranoia Survivor is rumored to be in Unlock on Max 2.

632
00:46:54,033 --> 00:46:54,534
[SPEAKER_13]: But guess what?

633
00:46:55,654 --> 00:46:56,695
[SPEAKER_13]: Guess what Glacial is?

634
00:46:58,096 --> 00:47:01,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Glacial is... Was a character in Killer Instinct.

635
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:05,880
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

636
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:05,940
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

637
00:47:07,876 --> 00:47:12,118
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a cover song.

638
00:47:12,259 --> 00:47:13,719
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a cover song done by B4U.

639
00:47:13,879 --> 00:47:14,940
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an English song.

640
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,882
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck, I can't remember what song it is.

641
00:47:19,762 --> 00:47:21,583
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a B4U cover of a song.

642
00:47:21,703 --> 00:47:22,384
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't remember.

643
00:47:22,404 --> 00:47:26,145
[SPEAKER_13]: I posted about it like a while ago, but it's just escaped my mind right now.

644
00:47:26,826 --> 00:47:30,868
[SPEAKER_13]: If we go to the Max Suicide, I can tell you because it says on it.

645
00:47:31,028 --> 00:47:32,729
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a future listless topic in waiting.

646
00:47:32,769 --> 00:47:35,050
[SPEAKER_16]: B4U, a song we'd like to see B4U ruin.

647
00:47:36,099 --> 00:47:37,860
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

648
00:48:00,427 --> 00:48:01,047
[SPEAKER_16]: Taka Remixed by Tak

649
00:48:21,702 --> 00:48:22,523
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it TAC Remix?

650
00:48:22,823 --> 00:48:24,224
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, either way, it's pretty much Outface.

651
00:48:24,264 --> 00:48:24,944
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Outface-y!

652
00:48:25,725 --> 00:48:28,446
[SPEAKER_16]: So, let's hear a little clip, because this is kind of bad quality.

653
00:48:28,466 --> 00:48:30,908
[SPEAKER_16]: We apologize, but it's all we got right now, but you can get a feel for it.

654
00:48:46,904 --> 00:48:48,625
[SPEAKER_16]: You can hear that guitar sound in it.

655
00:48:49,225 --> 00:48:53,547
[SPEAKER_13]: It sounds like a remix of Stoic mixed with Diamond Jealousy.

656
00:48:53,927 --> 00:48:55,048
[SPEAKER_13]: That's Yamaoka.

657
00:48:55,828 --> 00:48:57,809
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, but that's what I'm saying what it sounds like.

658
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:02,211
[SPEAKER_06]: My tack-dar went off.

659
00:49:03,612 --> 00:49:04,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Tack-dar?

660
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:07,691
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm now, um, I have to clean up, excuse me.

661
00:49:08,852 --> 00:49:11,813
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, while she's cleaning up, let's play a little bit of the Abyss remix.

662
00:49:11,833 --> 00:49:13,354
[SPEAKER_16]: This is Abyss, the Heaven's Mix.

663
00:49:13,714 --> 00:49:18,656
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you remember Ryu, who did Starmind and Fourth Mix, he's the guy who remixed this.

664
00:49:18,756 --> 00:49:19,677
[SPEAKER_16]: Here, a little clip of this.

665
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:37,111
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't sound a goddamn thing like the original.

666
00:49:37,352 --> 00:49:41,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Judging by the key presses, which I heard very loudly, that's either a 5 or 6.

667
00:49:43,777 --> 00:49:45,338
[SPEAKER_16]: Could have been Light 7, just to throw you, though.

668
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:48,021
[SPEAKER_16]: In fact, if they're recording it, they probably did it in Light 7.

669
00:49:48,061 --> 00:49:50,162
[SPEAKER_13]: It could have been me trying to play a 7-star song.

670
00:49:51,083 --> 00:49:52,685
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, this one I'm really excited about.

671
00:49:52,705 --> 00:49:56,027
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the new ping-pong song, Power Dream, and this song really kicks ass.

672
00:49:56,047 --> 00:49:57,869
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm looking forward to hearing the better quality version of this.

673
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:40,780
[SPEAKER_16]: Ding, ding, ding That just totally sounds like digital mind A little bit, a little bit But it's got its own happy carnival If it's tech, it's not happy Virtual mind, I'm sorry There you go, okay If it's tech, it's not happy Shit, what's that other one?

674
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:46,524
[SPEAKER_13]: Mind Parasite I knew it had mind in it, god damn it Mind Parasite, it sounds just like Mind Parasite

675
00:50:47,375 --> 00:50:51,102
[SPEAKER_16]: I've lost my mind, they're coming to take me away, haha

676
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:04,344
[SPEAKER_16]: Next one we're going to preview for you, the last one we're going to preview for you, this is Prelude, and this is one I'm excited about.

677
00:51:04,384 --> 00:51:05,265
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the new Naoki Underground song.

678
00:51:05,305 --> 00:51:07,385
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought you were excited about the other one.

679
00:51:07,705 --> 00:51:07,905
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

680
00:51:08,285 --> 00:51:09,666
[SPEAKER_06]: About the nine parasite.

681
00:51:10,246 --> 00:51:12,126
[SPEAKER_16]: No, well, I am, I'm, whatever.

682
00:51:12,466 --> 00:51:13,207
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's just hear this.

683
00:51:13,247 --> 00:51:13,987
[SPEAKER_16]: Now I remember!

684
00:51:14,207 --> 00:51:14,567
[SPEAKER_16]: Hold on.

685
00:51:14,867 --> 00:51:15,887
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, stop for a sec.

686
00:51:16,508 --> 00:51:16,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Glacial.

687
00:51:17,468 --> 00:51:22,149
[SPEAKER_13]: It was going to be a cover by Ryu Kosaka of Hypo Yorubi.

688
00:51:23,326 --> 00:51:24,147
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, God.

689
00:51:24,488 --> 00:51:25,108
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what it is.

690
00:51:25,769 --> 00:51:26,129
[SPEAKER_16]: Now I remember.

691
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:28,612
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually like Hyper Eurobeat.

692
00:51:28,772 --> 00:51:30,254
[SPEAKER_16]: There's one song I'm less excited about.

693
00:51:30,735 --> 00:51:31,055
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

694
00:51:32,437 --> 00:51:33,498
[SPEAKER_16]: The new System SF song.

695
00:51:33,538 --> 00:51:33,758
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay.

696
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:34,058
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

697
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:35,640
[SPEAKER_16]: Here we go.

698
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,562
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a little clip of Prelude by Naoki Underground.

699
00:51:37,582 --> 00:51:38,944
[SPEAKER_16]: This is my favorite so far, I think.

700
00:52:00,291 --> 00:52:01,771
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like L'Amour et la Liberté.

701
00:52:01,871 --> 00:52:03,092
[SPEAKER_16]: What did you say before that, though?

702
00:52:03,112 --> 00:52:05,252
[SPEAKER_06]: You said something... I was like, yay, it's another classical piece.

703
00:52:05,512 --> 00:52:07,032
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay, another classical piece they ripped off.

704
00:52:07,052 --> 00:52:08,953
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay, it's Vanity Angel all over again.

705
00:52:09,313 --> 00:52:12,574
[SPEAKER_16]: Now I'm going to preview for you Prelude featuring Paula Terry.

706
00:52:19,335 --> 00:52:19,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob?

707
00:52:20,015 --> 00:52:20,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes?

708
00:52:21,255 --> 00:52:21,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob?

709
00:52:22,676 --> 00:52:24,096
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, but now you have to die.

710
00:52:25,236 --> 00:52:25,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me that!

711
00:52:28,037 --> 00:52:29,077
[SPEAKER_06]: I have two microphones now.

712
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:35,664
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, what that should be is Prelude featuring Mr. Ryan and whatever the final band.

713
00:52:35,724 --> 00:52:39,647
[SPEAKER_06]: If it was Prelude featuring someone farting, it would sound better than Politary.

714
00:52:40,808 --> 00:52:41,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

715
00:52:42,709 --> 00:52:44,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Prelude featuring my ass!

716
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:45,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the burrito?

717
00:52:48,913 --> 00:52:50,394
[SPEAKER_16]: Prelude featuring my bunghole!

718
00:52:50,555 --> 00:52:50,875
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

719
00:52:50,935 --> 00:52:51,015
[SPEAKER_16]: Um...

720
00:52:56,511 --> 00:52:57,072
[SPEAKER_16]: Moving on.

721
00:52:57,873 --> 00:52:59,796
[SPEAKER_16]: Another interesting bit of news here.

722
00:52:59,936 --> 00:53:01,218
[SPEAKER_16]: I was given this tip.

723
00:53:01,418 --> 00:53:06,244
[SPEAKER_16]: I was given a tip, a lead, from a fellow in our chat room who goes by the name John Fields.

724
00:53:07,066 --> 00:53:09,168
[SPEAKER_16]: And Project Majestic Mix.

725
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:12,833
[SPEAKER_16]: I have no idea who that is, but I think they're a band.

726
00:53:14,662 --> 00:53:17,463
[SPEAKER_16]: However, they have a newsletter, and this is what their newsletter says.

727
00:53:17,943 --> 00:53:30,346
[SPEAKER_16]: In light of our new dance album in the works, some of you may be interested to know that we have obtained permission and are working planning to include our very own DDR PC Max CD-ROM game as part of the limited edition extra.

728
00:53:30,826 --> 00:53:32,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Your computer fell apart.

729
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, is your computer feeling fresh?

730
00:53:36,128 --> 00:53:37,968
[SPEAKER_16]: You're laughing at the computer, not the story, right?

731
00:53:38,008 --> 00:53:38,988
[SPEAKER_16]: My computer is just ghetto.

732
00:53:39,068 --> 00:53:40,369
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, let me finish.

733
00:53:40,389 --> 00:53:40,869
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I finish?

734
00:53:41,109 --> 00:53:41,449
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I finish?

735
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,962
[SPEAKER_16]: Majestic, oh, they did remixes of Final Fantasy music.

736
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:54,184
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, the whole graphics, sound effects, music, and announcer voices are planned to be 100% original.

737
00:53:54,225 --> 00:53:59,827
[SPEAKER_16]: We not only plan on including DDR versions of some of the new album music, but some remixes from our other album releases.

738
00:54:00,467 --> 00:54:03,209
[SPEAKER_14]: Gee, that sounds like Step Mania to me, you ass.

739
00:54:03,669 --> 00:54:04,509
[SPEAKER_16]: Freaking idiots.

740
00:54:04,669 --> 00:54:07,250
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait a minute, this could be officially Konami endorsed, though.

741
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:08,331
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the big deal about this.

742
00:54:08,351 --> 00:54:09,391
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh-huh, uh-huh.

743
00:54:09,592 --> 00:54:10,012
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

744
00:54:10,032 --> 00:54:10,432
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

745
00:54:11,072 --> 00:54:12,333
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait a minute though, wait a minute though.

746
00:54:12,553 --> 00:54:15,896
[SPEAKER_16]: Would somebody who's putting out like a bonafide real album be that risky?

747
00:54:16,356 --> 00:54:18,678
[SPEAKER_16]: It's gotta be Blessed by Konami if they're gonna rip off a DDR interface.

748
00:54:18,718 --> 00:54:24,022
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll have you know that my next track will be in the next DDR Max 3 for the home version, yes.

749
00:54:24,943 --> 00:54:25,383
[SPEAKER_13]: A new track.

750
00:54:25,403 --> 00:54:26,364
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, it's all my music.

751
00:54:26,584 --> 00:54:29,466
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, they're giving me all the proceeds from that.

752
00:54:29,927 --> 00:54:31,288
[SPEAKER_16]: Could you listen to this part again, Loki?

753
00:54:31,688 --> 00:54:33,529
[SPEAKER_16]: We have obtained permission.

754
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:35,371
[SPEAKER_16]: Which would mean...

755
00:54:35,834 --> 00:54:36,334
[SPEAKER_13]: Good on me, right?

756
00:54:36,354 --> 00:54:37,035
[SPEAKER_13]: Which means crap.

757
00:54:37,075 --> 00:54:42,077
[SPEAKER_13]: It means we've obtained permission to remix their music, saying that we won't permission to slap you.

758
00:54:43,098 --> 00:54:43,798
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all it says.

759
00:54:44,138 --> 00:54:47,240
[SPEAKER_06]: That means look for a press kit, look for the press releases.

760
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:49,521
[SPEAKER_06]: It means don't jack shit.

761
00:54:49,701 --> 00:54:51,502
[SPEAKER_06]: It means jack shit, exactly.

762
00:54:51,602 --> 00:54:57,646
[SPEAKER_13]: It means that they've obtained permission to remix the official songs that they made from the DDR home versions.

763
00:54:58,266 --> 00:54:59,106
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all it is.

764
00:55:00,007 --> 00:55:01,648
Can I remix this song?

765
00:55:02,088 --> 00:55:03,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, son, why not?

766
00:55:09,155 --> 00:55:10,616
[SPEAKER_16]: I was just thinking if there's anything on their site.

767
00:55:10,716 --> 00:55:12,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever, you know, fine.

768
00:55:12,777 --> 00:55:13,738
[SPEAKER_02]: If it is, yay.

769
00:55:13,778 --> 00:55:15,239
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, whatever.

770
00:55:15,319 --> 00:55:16,780
[SPEAKER_13]: DDR PC sucks anyways.

771
00:55:17,641 --> 00:55:19,002
Mr. Spanky!

772
00:55:20,142 --> 00:55:21,303
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we shall see what happens.

773
00:55:21,543 --> 00:55:24,505
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, maybe it's DDR Ultramix.

774
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:29,148
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, Majestic Mix, if you're listening, surprise the pants off of Loki, because that would be funny.

775
00:55:30,569 --> 00:55:31,370
[SPEAKER_16]: DDR Meow Mix?

776
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:36,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you tell everyone about the Will & Grace episode?

777
00:55:51,963 --> 00:55:54,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Will and Grace is gay.

778
00:55:54,605 --> 00:55:58,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's about, you know, a fag and his... No, not the show, the episode.

779
00:55:59,507 --> 00:56:04,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well, it's Grace's birthday and Jack and Karen take her out to an arcade and there's a fifth mix and they play it.

780
00:56:06,091 --> 00:56:07,092
[SPEAKER_19]: What song do they play?

781
00:56:07,672 --> 00:56:11,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they don't play songs that are really in DDR.

782
00:56:11,454 --> 00:56:14,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Jack plays Holiday, but not like the DDR version.

783
00:56:14,096 --> 00:56:14,556
[SPEAKER_06]: What about

784
00:56:16,141 --> 00:56:18,785
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, it has the background to Abyss, which is funny.

785
00:56:18,825 --> 00:56:20,547
[SPEAKER_16]: Holiday has Abyss' background, apparently.

786
00:56:20,867 --> 00:56:24,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, on the screen, it says Abyss, and he's playing Holiday.

787
00:56:24,071 --> 00:56:28,517
[SPEAKER_06]: But, like, when she's going to play another game, there was, like, Puzzle Fighter 2 or something.

788
00:56:28,798 --> 00:56:32,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it was playing Abyss in the background, and it played Dynamite Rave also while the kid was playing.

789
00:56:32,983 --> 00:56:34,345
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, the little kid was playing Dynamite Rave.

790
00:56:37,914 --> 00:56:38,554
[SPEAKER_16]: And then Grace.

791
00:56:38,654 --> 00:56:40,835
[SPEAKER_16]: It was so funny to watch Grace dance.

792
00:56:40,936 --> 00:56:45,718
[SPEAKER_06]: You make it sound like my anti-TV stance is like total social deprivation.

793
00:56:45,738 --> 00:56:45,978
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

794
00:56:46,738 --> 00:56:47,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Well... Shut up.

795
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:48,019
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't ask you.

796
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:52,721
[SPEAKER_06]: It was sort of wrong.

797
00:56:52,761 --> 00:56:56,462
[SPEAKER_06]: My life is much more enriched through reading fanfiction.

798
00:56:57,143 --> 00:56:58,043
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, books.

799
00:56:58,844 --> 00:57:01,785
[SPEAKER_15]: But is DDR in your fanfic episodes?

800
00:57:03,312 --> 00:57:03,773
[SPEAKER_06]: They could be.

801
00:57:06,095 --> 00:57:07,957
[SPEAKER_06]: I will put DDR in my next story.

802
00:57:07,997 --> 00:57:08,397
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that?

803
00:57:09,038 --> 00:57:09,398
[SPEAKER_16]: Fair enough.

804
00:57:09,498 --> 00:57:09,959
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, doorbell.

805
00:57:09,979 --> 00:57:11,080
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's see who comes to the door now.

806
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,141
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's going to get it?

807
00:57:12,301 --> 00:57:12,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

808
00:57:12,561 --> 00:57:14,923
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet it's... Oh, Brian's got it.

809
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:17,726
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet it's... Oh, no, our intern.

810
00:57:19,107 --> 00:57:20,488
[SPEAKER_16]: I have no idea who's coming through the door.

811
00:57:20,709 --> 00:57:21,389
[SPEAKER_06]: It's our intern.

812
00:57:21,469 --> 00:57:22,851
[SPEAKER_16]: It's our intern zero.

813
00:57:23,011 --> 00:57:23,451
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello.

814
00:57:23,471 --> 00:57:24,152
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you have anybody with you?

815
00:57:25,106 --> 00:57:25,806
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, yeah.

816
00:57:26,306 --> 00:57:27,187
[SPEAKER_17]: This is Jim.

817
00:57:27,847 --> 00:57:28,567
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, Jim.

818
00:57:28,627 --> 00:57:29,447
[SPEAKER_17]: He's from Fremont.

819
00:57:29,887 --> 00:57:30,888
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, Jim from Fremont.

820
00:57:30,908 --> 00:57:31,948
[SPEAKER_17]: Everyone can say hi.

821
00:57:32,888 --> 00:57:33,628
[SPEAKER_15]: And who else is here?

822
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:34,348
[SPEAKER_17]: Anita.

823
00:57:34,569 --> 00:57:35,229
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, Anita.

824
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:35,949
[SPEAKER_17]: Johnny.

825
00:57:36,609 --> 00:57:37,329
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, everybody.

826
00:57:37,349 --> 00:57:38,009
[SPEAKER_17]: And Jason.

827
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:39,970
[SPEAKER_16]: Dang, what the hell?

828
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:41,350
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a party all of a sudden.

829
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:44,191
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we all fit in a clown car.

830
00:57:44,371 --> 00:57:49,653
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sitting here going, gee, we've got like only the three of us here at house, and then all of a sudden everybody's showing up.

831
00:57:49,673 --> 00:57:50,873
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, the clown car show.

832
00:57:50,893 --> 00:57:51,153
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello.

833
00:57:52,549 --> 00:57:53,149
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up, everyone?

834
00:57:53,329 --> 00:57:53,770
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Jim.

835
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:54,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice to meet you all.

836
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:55,451
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you play DDR at all?

837
00:57:55,751 --> 00:57:56,571
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm afraid to say no.

838
00:57:57,592 --> 00:57:58,212
[SPEAKER_16]: You'll fit right in.

839
00:57:58,352 --> 00:57:59,052
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, Anita.

840
00:57:59,453 --> 00:58:00,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, DDRcoholic here.

841
00:58:00,873 --> 00:58:01,994
[SPEAKER_05]: How is everybody?

842
00:58:02,574 --> 00:58:02,794
[SPEAKER_16]: Good.

843
00:58:02,834 --> 00:58:03,995
[SPEAKER_16]: How's your DDR addiction?

844
00:58:04,775 --> 00:58:08,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, I'm on step nine of the 12-step program.

845
00:58:09,278 --> 00:58:11,499
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming along.

846
00:58:11,619 --> 00:58:12,279
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming along fine.

847
00:58:12,419 --> 00:58:14,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, NyQuil's the 13th step.

848
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:19,883
[SPEAKER_05]: NyQuil is the 13th step, and I am almost ready with my case of NyQuil.

849
00:58:20,503 --> 00:58:21,484
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just waiting to open it.

850
00:58:23,295 --> 00:58:26,217
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have... It's D-Child.

851
00:58:26,537 --> 00:58:28,579
[SPEAKER_10]: God, I'm so fucking tired right now.

852
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:29,959
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, how late did you stay up?

853
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,562
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh... Did you stay up to greet the Easter Bunny?

854
00:58:34,682 --> 00:58:35,103
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

855
00:58:35,923 --> 00:58:37,324
[SPEAKER_16]: I greeted the Easter Bunny all right.

856
00:58:40,586 --> 00:58:41,427
[SPEAKER_16]: Where's my damn candy?

857
00:58:42,167 --> 00:58:43,928
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, so anyway, yeah, DDR on Will and Grace.

858
00:58:44,028 --> 00:58:44,729
[SPEAKER_16]: Ha, that was funny.

859
00:58:45,834 --> 00:58:48,755
[SPEAKER_16]: That was probably the dumbest thing I've heard all day.

860
00:58:48,795 --> 00:58:48,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

861
00:59:15,003 --> 00:59:15,984
[SPEAKER_19]: About, yeah, yeah.

862
00:59:18,845 --> 00:59:20,146
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, who else, who else is here?

863
00:59:20,166 --> 00:59:21,207
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, there's somebody in the hall.

864
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,169
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, what's up?

865
00:59:25,189 --> 00:59:26,310
[SPEAKER_16]: This is Bombay.

866
00:59:31,493 --> 00:59:33,334
[SPEAKER_16]: I got to beat your character up today in Soul Calibur.

867
00:59:36,096 --> 00:59:37,257
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you, did you beat her hard?

868
00:59:38,246 --> 00:59:41,969
[SPEAKER_16]: I beat her long and hard with my lesbian character.

869
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:44,090
[SPEAKER_16]: With the big titties.

870
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:45,851
[SPEAKER_16]: They're all lesbians.

871
00:59:46,072 --> 00:59:48,853
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the first time I've played Soul Calibur 2 in a long, long time.

872
00:59:48,894 --> 00:59:50,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Taki is the dyke of the game.

873
00:59:50,395 --> 00:59:52,096
[SPEAKER_06]: She's also the dominatrix.

874
00:59:52,876 --> 00:59:56,018
[SPEAKER_06]: But then suddenly I was... Taki is... She does whatever.

875
00:59:56,119 --> 00:59:57,019
[SPEAKER_06]: She's good for anything.

876
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,081
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Cassandra's the quick lay.

877
01:00:00,121 --> 01:00:00,822
[SPEAKER_06]: She does everybody.

878
01:00:02,083 --> 01:00:04,044
[SPEAKER_16]: Conquest came up and suddenly I'm fighting D-Child.

879
01:00:04,084 --> 01:00:04,304
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm like...

880
01:00:09,832 --> 01:00:11,193
[SPEAKER_17]: Did you fight F-Yo Mama?

881
01:00:12,494 --> 01:00:14,415
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't remember fighting F-Yo Mama.

882
01:00:16,736 --> 01:00:17,176
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

883
01:00:17,216 --> 01:00:20,638
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to find a Killik named DarkSakura in there.

884
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, newsflash.

885
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,261
[SPEAKER_06]: His special attribute is cheat bitch power.

886
01:00:27,682 --> 01:00:32,144
[SPEAKER_16]: Newsflash, we have the address to the new TAPEX from Skyline.

887
01:00:32,244 --> 01:00:34,945
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a TAPEX in Sacramento now, in South Sac.

888
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:37,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Those bitches, my dad was going to make one, and then they brought one here.

889
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:41,821
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, there's one in Southside now, so we might go after the show.

890
01:00:42,762 --> 01:00:50,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, I'd just like to say, coming from the Bay Area where there's real boba and real pearl tea, Tapioca Express is gay.

891
01:00:51,749 --> 01:00:52,650
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all we got!

892
01:00:53,851 --> 01:00:55,072
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really not that bad.

893
01:00:55,092 --> 01:00:59,455
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I've tried some of the boba that we had at that one place in Fremont.

894
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:00,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that real boba?

895
01:01:01,637 --> 01:01:03,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, their boba is just as good.

896
01:01:03,799 --> 01:01:04,719
[SPEAKER_05]: What, like lolly cup?

897
01:01:04,739 --> 01:01:06,341
[SPEAKER_05]: No, dude.

898
01:01:09,337 --> 01:01:10,880
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other Bomani news you can think of, Loki?

899
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,322
[SPEAKER_16]: Was there anything else this week we had to talk about?

900
01:01:14,265 --> 01:01:15,086
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, your car.

901
01:01:15,527 --> 01:01:16,608
[SPEAKER_16]: Want to talk about your car?

902
01:01:16,648 --> 01:01:17,529
[SPEAKER_19]: That was funny.

903
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:22,016
[SPEAKER_16]: Tell us all about the car prank you played while I look up to see if there's any other news we're missing.

904
01:01:22,337 --> 01:01:23,378
[SPEAKER_19]: That was hilarious.

905
01:01:24,669 --> 01:01:42,966
[SPEAKER_13]: at my work on Friday they brought for a promotional thing for Fast and Furious the tricked out edition DVD that's coming out they brought one of the cars from Too Fast Too Furious which I must say that this car while being in the movie was stock and it just had a nice paint job it was

906
01:01:43,286 --> 01:01:56,401
[SPEAKER_13]: which was sort of getting chipped and actually someone stole the exhaust off of it they physically cut the exhaust off with a hacksaw that was hilarious but yeah, it was really cool and no one could tell but

907
01:01:56,912 --> 01:02:05,540
[SPEAKER_13]: I took my friend Andy, who's kind of a fanatic about the whole thing, he took pictures of him taking the car off of the trailer and stuff, and then I took a picture inside the car.

908
01:02:05,941 --> 01:02:14,209
[SPEAKER_13]: So I thought it'd be really funny, because, you know, I was really bored that day, to post pictures online of me sitting in the car telling people that I bought the car off of eBay.

909
01:02:14,449 --> 01:02:18,573
[SPEAKER_13]: Because if anyone knows me, I have just been buying shit off of eBay like crazy.

910
01:02:18,653 --> 01:02:21,976
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's slightly believable, but then again, yeah.

911
01:02:23,666 --> 01:02:31,492
[SPEAKER_10]: I first started getting suspicious when I saw it was parked on a sidewalk, but then just to check on how much they were, I went on eBay, and those cars aren't that bad priced.

912
01:02:31,532 --> 01:02:37,056
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw a Beamer that was fully tricked out for under $30,000, and I mean, Beamers for under $30,000, that's pretty good.

913
01:02:38,499 --> 01:02:41,700
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so anyways, I had a couple people go in there for like a little bit.

914
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:56,146
[SPEAKER_13]: I was waiting for Rob because Rob, I was thinking, you know, see now, it was so much for Afterthought, but I was going to say, you know, I should have posted, yeah, Rob, I need to borrow like $500 because I spent too much money on this.

915
01:02:56,546 --> 01:02:58,226
[SPEAKER_13]: But instead, no, I didn't do that.

916
01:02:58,406 --> 01:02:59,807
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you're so kind.

917
01:02:59,827 --> 01:03:01,548
[SPEAKER_13]: And he saw right through because he knew me better.

918
01:03:01,608 --> 01:03:04,349
[SPEAKER_13]: He knew that I'd buy a DDR machine before I'd buy a nice car, so.

919
01:03:05,809 --> 01:03:06,089
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

920
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:07,570
[SPEAKER_16]: I got you.

921
01:03:09,062 --> 01:03:09,482
[SPEAKER_13]: I try.

922
01:03:11,084 --> 01:03:11,785
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm fucking great.

923
01:03:13,126 --> 01:03:16,469
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so... Any other of my news you can think of?

924
01:03:16,649 --> 01:03:17,250
[SPEAKER_16]: Ultramix.

925
01:03:18,031 --> 01:03:19,172
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there new news on Ultramix?

926
01:03:19,808 --> 01:03:20,509
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, no.

927
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:22,550
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, thanks!

928
01:03:24,031 --> 01:03:24,612
[SPEAKER_15]: Bravo!

929
01:03:24,632 --> 01:03:26,133
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just out there in limbo.

930
01:03:26,613 --> 01:03:27,874
[SPEAKER_19]: Um... Shit.

931
01:03:28,835 --> 01:03:31,197
[SPEAKER_19]: Um... Not really anything else.

932
01:03:31,877 --> 01:03:34,279
[SPEAKER_19]: Um... Well, there's sim news, I guess.

933
01:03:34,879 --> 01:03:35,920
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, what about Tournament Explore?

934
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,581
[SPEAKER_19]: Tournament Explore has been announced.

935
01:03:37,902 --> 01:03:39,523
[SPEAKER_19]: It's gonna be on June 15th.

936
01:03:39,923 --> 01:03:40,383
[SPEAKER_19]: That's all.

937
01:03:40,624 --> 01:03:41,344
[SPEAKER_19]: That's all I've got.

938
01:03:41,584 --> 01:03:42,105
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just a date.

939
01:03:42,665 --> 01:03:43,506
[SPEAKER_19]: Just June 15th.

940
01:03:44,106 --> 01:03:47,549
[SPEAKER_19]: And, um... And, uh...

941
01:03:49,088 --> 01:03:54,357
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yeah, we were still going to be doing a TV show DWI contest, but we got lazy and haven't really planned for it yet.

942
01:03:54,437 --> 01:03:57,562
[SPEAKER_16]: So look for a big announcement at B3.

943
01:03:59,972 --> 01:04:01,333
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, that'll give us enough time.

944
01:04:01,353 --> 01:04:02,073
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, yes, look for that.

945
01:04:02,693 --> 01:04:04,974
[SPEAKER_16]: That'll give us plenty of time to get up off our ass and do something.

946
01:04:04,994 --> 01:04:07,155
[SPEAKER_13]: There's also, well, a couple things.

947
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:20,800
[SPEAKER_13]: Bomani Style, they've opened up, well, they're going to be opening up, I haven't gotten my email yet, but opening up a leech server for all those who contributed to them, which I did, so I will get access to a leech server with a bunch of cool shit on it.

948
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:21,600
[SPEAKER_13]: Ooh, you're special.

949
01:04:21,781 --> 01:04:22,181
[SPEAKER_13]: I know I am.

950
01:04:22,781 --> 01:04:27,823
[SPEAKER_13]: And then there's also, let's see, this guy Shuey, who I've been working with, he's

951
01:04:28,243 --> 01:04:32,664
[SPEAKER_13]: He's starting a project called, um, was it the DWI History Project or whatever?

952
01:04:32,884 --> 01:04:37,306
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, he has up-to-date every single sim file that's ever been made.

953
01:04:37,526 --> 01:04:37,866
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty much.

954
01:04:39,246 --> 01:04:41,307
[SPEAKER_16]: Another question coming from the chatroom from Skyline.

955
01:04:41,327 --> 01:04:42,347
[SPEAKER_16]: Are we going to E3?

956
01:04:43,327 --> 01:04:43,787
[SPEAKER_16]: Probably not.

957
01:04:44,688 --> 01:04:46,328
[SPEAKER_16]: Unless someone gives us tickets really fast.

958
01:04:46,408 --> 01:04:54,950
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been asking that in, um... I can get the time off work in a... in Jiffy, but... I've been asking that, um, but I don't know.

959
01:04:56,971 --> 01:04:57,051
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh...

960
01:05:00,325 --> 01:05:00,625
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

961
01:05:00,825 --> 01:05:05,248
[SPEAKER_19]: I have tickets for The Matrix Reloaded that day, so it's a gimme.

962
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:06,849
[SPEAKER_16]: I was like, I want to see The Matrix.

963
01:05:08,289 --> 01:05:08,650
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

964
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:12,952
[SPEAKER_13]: To be honest, I don't think I have the money to go to E3, but I would like to anyway.

965
01:05:13,012 --> 01:05:13,332
[SPEAKER_16]: I do.

966
01:05:13,412 --> 01:05:13,933
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to go.

967
01:05:15,133 --> 01:05:17,034
[SPEAKER_16]: I would fucking blow someone to go to E3.

968
01:05:17,535 --> 01:05:17,775
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

969
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:20,236
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's go hang out on the street.

970
01:05:20,256 --> 01:05:22,497
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll come up with tickets pretty quick.

971
01:05:24,138 --> 01:05:27,300
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's go hang out on the street corner in front of E3 and see if we can't get in.

972
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:27,960
Okay.

973
01:05:29,409 --> 01:05:33,853
[SPEAKER_13]: We can film it and do wacky shit and disguise ourselves like stuff.

974
01:05:34,153 --> 01:05:35,575
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, we're the wacky media.

975
01:05:35,595 --> 01:05:40,699
[SPEAKER_06]: We can pretend we're bums and then the bum fight people will pay us to beat each other up and then I'll kick your ass.

976
01:05:40,959 --> 01:05:41,460
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be fine.

977
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:45,143
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know, someone with some kind of military-based first-person shooter is bound to be there.

978
01:05:45,163 --> 01:05:46,624
[SPEAKER_06]: We can dress Rob up like a booth babe.

979
01:05:49,247 --> 01:05:50,167
[SPEAKER_10]: I can be Riku.

980
01:05:52,629 --> 01:05:56,373
[SPEAKER_10]: With all the military games, just dress in camel and walk right in like you're part of the show.

981
01:05:58,231 --> 01:06:04,753
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, we want to do a list list pretty soon here, but we need time to think about it.

982
01:06:04,793 --> 01:06:07,694
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we need to do FU's of the week still, and we need to do the cage match.

983
01:06:07,934 --> 01:06:09,195
[SPEAKER_16]: So, what first?

984
01:06:09,655 --> 01:06:10,295
[SPEAKER_16]: FU's or cage match?

985
01:06:10,655 --> 01:06:11,155
[SPEAKER_16]: FU's.

986
01:06:11,235 --> 01:06:11,835
[SPEAKER_16]: FU's, alright, fine.

987
01:06:11,855 --> 01:06:16,517
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to go to a quick break, and we'll come back and do the FU's of the week.

988
01:06:16,717 --> 01:06:17,237
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, kids?

989
01:06:17,377 --> 01:06:23,039
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you can send them over a private message to moi, my name is Sky, hi, and I'm in the chat room.

990
01:06:24,678 --> 01:06:31,400
[SPEAKER_16]: Sky High, very cute.

991
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:36,961
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm in the chat room and send me your FUs of the week over private message and we'll get to those right when we come back.

992
01:06:37,001 --> 01:06:43,842
[SPEAKER_16]: In the meantime, here's that new special little paranoia that's going to be in Max 2, or so they say, the Japanese home release.

993
01:06:43,882 --> 01:06:49,843
[SPEAKER_16]: Coming out this week, this is Paranoia Sur... And I have it on order too, with the VRare soundtrack.

994
01:06:49,924 --> 01:06:50,184
Yay!

995
01:06:51,224 --> 01:06:51,804
[SPEAKER_16]: Here's a cookie.

996
01:06:51,864 --> 01:06:51,924
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay!

997
01:06:53,434 --> 01:06:54,611
[SPEAKER_16]: Here's Paranoia Survivor.

998
01:06:54,671 --> 01:06:54,894
[SPEAKER_16]: Enjoy.

999
01:11:30,507 --> 01:11:31,768
[SPEAKER_16]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1000
01:11:32,088 --> 01:11:34,249
[SPEAKER_16]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

1001
01:11:40,873 --> 01:11:42,134
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright kids, here we go.

1002
01:11:42,734 --> 01:11:43,395
[SPEAKER_16]: As promised.

1003
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:50,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait for it.

1004
01:11:51,259 --> 01:11:52,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait for it.

1005
01:11:57,343 --> 01:11:59,444
[SPEAKER_06]: My fucking leak goes to Squeenix.

1006
01:12:00,379 --> 01:12:04,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn you, Square Enix, whatever the fuck you're calling yourself.

1007
01:12:04,721 --> 01:12:06,362
[SPEAKER_06]: I call you Squeenix because you suck.

1008
01:12:08,103 --> 01:12:15,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you for not listening to me and for not listening to Michelle because we had this discussion earlier today.

1009
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:17,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn you for sucking so bad.

1010
01:12:18,568 --> 01:12:20,709
[SPEAKER_06]: For not making Kingdom Hearts the way we want you to.

1011
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:24,911
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, thank you for waiting until 2004 to release Kingdom Hearts 2.

1012
01:12:29,218 --> 01:12:29,598
[SPEAKER_30]: Bitches.

1013
01:12:29,818 --> 01:12:30,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Bitches.

1014
01:12:33,039 --> 01:12:37,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn you for not taking advantage of your other licensing.

1015
01:12:37,861 --> 01:12:49,085
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can tell you this right now, that if you do not take advantage of the Enix Association and go and bust some new characters on Kingdom Hearts 2, I will personally go to Tokyo in a tank and run you all over.

1016
01:12:49,925 --> 01:12:56,187
[SPEAKER_06]: I will put collars on your necks and enact Battle Royale, and then whoever wins the Battle Royale...

1017
01:12:57,799 --> 01:12:59,120
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go, okay, you can go.

1018
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:01,241
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll take the collar off and then I'll stick a knife in your head.

1019
01:13:04,103 --> 01:13:05,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Gosh, Jamie, you're really mean.

1020
01:13:06,965 --> 01:13:07,725
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no, no.

1021
01:13:08,145 --> 01:13:08,526
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.

1022
01:13:08,686 --> 01:13:14,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Before I put the knife in their head, I'll shave their balls with a cheese grater and pour alcohol on it.

1023
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:17,851
[SPEAKER_06]: She's productive, okay?

1024
01:13:18,612 --> 01:13:19,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I get results.

1025
01:13:19,632 --> 01:13:19,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1026
01:13:20,133 --> 01:13:20,593
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1027
01:13:20,833 --> 01:13:24,155
[SPEAKER_19]: And then once I... You'll feed them the flake first.

1028
01:13:24,747 --> 01:13:27,869
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'll make them drink down the alcohol with the blood mixed in it afterwards.

1029
01:13:28,369 --> 01:13:29,690
[SPEAKER_15]: Gosh, Jamie, you're a real bitch.

1030
01:13:30,271 --> 01:13:32,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Not wasting anything.

1031
01:13:33,032 --> 01:13:34,193
[SPEAKER_19]: Not wasting one thing.

1032
01:13:34,473 --> 01:13:37,675
[SPEAKER_06]: They're drinking the alcohol that has the blood and the, like, sequestering.

1033
01:13:38,796 --> 01:13:43,839
[SPEAKER_06]: And then once I've taken over Squeenix, first of all, I'm going to give it a cool name.

1034
01:13:44,259 --> 01:13:45,840
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be called Cute.

1035
01:13:47,101 --> 01:13:48,202
[SPEAKER_16]: How about Spike?

1036
01:13:49,022 --> 01:13:49,743
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be called...

1037
01:13:51,335 --> 01:13:54,738
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be called Not Squeamix, how's that?

1038
01:13:55,899 --> 01:14:16,177
[SPEAKER_06]: And then once I've taken it over, I'm going to make my own freaking RPG Because I'm going to take advantage of all those licenses And because of the association with Sony, Sony's got their fingers in everything I'm going to have the ultimate RPG I can think of one thing they don't have their fingers in I'm just saying

1039
01:14:17,909 --> 01:14:25,312
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, and then, and then I'm going to make my own gaming system because nothing that's out right now will be able to use it.

1040
01:14:26,432 --> 01:14:31,554
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'm going to take over Gravity and make Ragnarok Online cool.

1041
01:14:31,594 --> 01:14:35,435
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not making an Xbox.

1042
01:14:36,616 --> 01:14:40,317
[SPEAKER_19]: Fuck you all, we're making it for our system, you can't have it unless you buy our expensive system.

1043
01:14:40,477 --> 01:14:42,658
[SPEAKER_16]: All I heard Jamie say was I'm taking over Gravity.

1044
01:14:44,461 --> 01:14:45,701
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, now she's taking on the force.

1045
01:14:45,961 --> 01:14:47,482
[SPEAKER_16]: Mother Nature, burn!

1046
01:14:48,622 --> 01:14:49,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, fuck you, Nature.

1047
01:14:50,423 --> 01:14:51,983
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm rewriting physics, dammit.

1048
01:14:52,063 --> 01:14:53,283
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got the Moldyver power.

1049
01:14:53,943 --> 01:14:54,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

1050
01:14:55,104 --> 01:14:58,545
[SPEAKER_06]: My next fuck you of the week goes toward this troll who was on the road behind me.

1051
01:14:58,585 --> 01:14:59,245
[SPEAKER_06]: There's more?

1052
01:14:59,605 --> 01:15:00,645
[SPEAKER_06]: There's more.

1053
01:15:01,885 --> 01:15:08,727
[SPEAKER_06]: This... And again, and again... Again, I'm not a shallow person, usually.

1054
01:15:09,227 --> 01:15:12,328
[SPEAKER_06]: This person made me think that Trogdor was gorgeous.

1055
01:15:15,185 --> 01:15:20,848
[SPEAKER_06]: This person, this person made Corky in the Wonder Years.

1056
01:15:21,788 --> 01:15:23,629
[SPEAKER_15]: You mean Life Goes On.

1057
01:15:23,669 --> 01:15:24,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Life Goes On.

1058
01:15:24,990 --> 01:15:26,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Looked like a beauty queen.

1059
01:15:32,113 --> 01:15:32,974
[SPEAKER_15]: I miss America.

1116
01:18:09,088 --> 01:18:11,011
[SPEAKER_14]: What, you think you're going to get laid by her or something?

1117
01:18:11,131 --> 01:18:12,873
[SPEAKER_15]: Our chat room is just going off.

1118
01:18:12,953 --> 01:18:13,954

01:18:18,901 --> 01:18:25,950
[SPEAKER_16]: I was so, I was so wishing... I mean, I didn't like, you know, Ricky that much, and I didn't like, you know, whoever her name was.

1122
01:18:26,010 --> 01:18:27,792
[SPEAKER_15]: Julia D'Amato ruined Flashdance.

1123
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:28,594

[SPEAKER_14]: I swear, what was she singing the other day?

1126
01:18:33,878 --> 01:18:43,602
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember what it was, but it sounded like... It's just like... Yeah, seriously.

1127
01:18:43,682 --> 01:18:50,725
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to sing like a fucking country star, there's another channel for you with this stupid country version of American Idol.

1128
01:18:50,785 --> 01:18:53,106
[SPEAKER_13]: Go there and get out of American Idol.

1129
01:18:53,166 --> 01:18:55,407
[SPEAKER_16]: Because you're going to lose anyway to fucking Ruben.

1130
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:56,607
[SPEAKER_16]: Ruben's going to kick your ass.

1131
01:18:56,947 --> 01:18:58,408
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a special message to Michelle.

1132
01:18:59,454 --> 01:19:01,074

[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, and now another FDU2 fucking roulette on DDR Extreme.

1136
01:19:09,496 --> 01:19:10,496
[SPEAKER_13]: How you mock me?

01:19:10,916 --> 01:19:14,717
[SPEAKER_13]: Dammit, giving me fucking Crash and then Sakura after I played Sakura.

01:19:16,897 --> 01:19:20,778
[SPEAKER_14]: Stupid, and you taunt me with your goddamn getting on Legend of Max and then moving down.

1140
01:19:20,878 --> 01:19:21,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving down, moving down.

1141
01:19:21,778 --> 01:19:22,558
[SPEAKER_14]: You better watch out, Rob.

1142
01:19:22,618 --> 01:19:28,119
[SPEAKER_18]: Up, down, fucking A. Um, I've gotten Legend of Max four times in a row.

1143
01:19:32,148 --> 01:19:34,490
[SPEAKER_14]: Not even gonna do it, because I will end up killing him.

1144
01:19:34,690 --> 01:19:36,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone get him a cookie!

1145
01:19:37,672 --> 01:19:40,915
[SPEAKER_13]: No, but seriously, I hate that fucking machine, and it sucks ass.

1146
01:19:41,035 --> 01:19:44,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, FU to the fuck- But I thought Cutie Chaser was your favorite song.

1147
01:19:44,538 --> 01:19:47,220
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, it was my favorite song until I started getting crashed all the time.

1148
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:48,881
[SPEAKER_13]: Crash, and I'm gonna get ya.

1149
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:51,583
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm gonna get- Yeah, no.

[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

1151
01:19:52,404 --> 01:19:53,685
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't like that song anymore either.

1152
01:19:54,025 --> 01:19:56,307
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, it gives me all the songs that people don't play.

1153
01:19:56,507 --> 01:19:57,908
[SPEAKER_13]: Hmm, let's see, what song sucks?

1154
01:19:57,928 --> 01:19:58,789
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's give him back.

1155
01:19:58,869 --> 01:19:59,109
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1156
01:19:59,569 --> 01:20:00,190
[SPEAKER_13]: But no, um...

1157
01:20:01,292 --> 01:20:08,538
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, uh, Nephew to the DDR Max 2 machine that was at Scandi because your arrow was broken and, yeah, and they turned off, but, I'm sorry.

1158
01:20:09,299 --> 01:20:16,745
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, Nephew to the stupid drivers, stupid people, and... I don't know.

1159
01:20:17,025 --> 01:20:22,910
[SPEAKER_13]: Nephew is back and my turntables haven't gotten here yet because this stupid guy slacked off on sending them to me because he sucks.

1160
01:20:23,730 --> 01:20:24,331
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um...

1161
01:20:25,714 --> 01:20:26,415
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's it.

1162
01:20:26,455 --> 01:20:27,195
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm done for now.

1163
01:20:27,636 --> 01:20:29,337
[SPEAKER_16]: I would just like to take this moment to read.

1164
01:20:29,498 --> 01:20:31,600
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm looking at one page of our chat room.

1165
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:32,080
[SPEAKER_16]: Here we go.

1166
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,162
[SPEAKER_16]: Just some random lines here.

1167
01:20:34,923 --> 01:20:37,765
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude, Rob, you can have Jim Barraros, but I want Clay.

1168
01:20:37,825 --> 01:20:38,987
[SPEAKER_16]: But Clay is humble pie.

1169
01:20:39,127 --> 01:20:40,388
[SPEAKER_16]: Let the black win, dammit.

1170
01:20:40,808 --> 01:20:42,210
[SPEAKER_16]: STFU, Ruben is cool.

1171
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:43,911
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think Clay is gay anyway.

1172
01:20:44,972 --> 01:20:47,074
[SPEAKER_16]: We've turned into Channel Pound American Idol.

1173
01:20:47,094 --> 01:20:47,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Congratulations.

1174

[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, okay.

1175
01:20:49,156 --> 01:20:49,917
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Loki.

1176
01:20:50,868 --> 01:20:52,949
[SPEAKER_13]: Clay can sing, but he can't perform, okay?

1177
01:20:52,989 --> 01:20:54,589
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, this is not American Idol chat.

1178
01:20:54,609 --> 01:20:56,210
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the episode of the week.

1179
01:20:56,270 --> 01:20:57,570
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to do my Carmen one more time.

1180
01:20:57,590 --> 01:20:57,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Ready?

1181

[SPEAKER_14]: That's another thing.

1184
01:21:03,732 --> 01:21:04,992
[SPEAKER_14]: Another thing about American Idol.

1185
01:21:05,373 --> 01:21:09,794
[SPEAKER_14]: Fucking A, if you sing God bless USA one more time, I hope they fucking bomb your ass.

1186
01:21:10,154 --> 01:21:13,336
[SPEAKER_14]: Because seriously, how many times do you sell out about these stupid shows?

1187
01:21:13,536 --> 01:21:17,439
[SPEAKER_13]: And another F you that's stupid reality TV with the goddamn Mr. Personality.

1188
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:20,361
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, let's get Mrs. Personality on there, Monica Lewinsky.

1189
01:21:20,381 --> 01:21:22,863
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, she doesn't judge people before she goes down on them.

1190
01:21:23,635 --> 01:21:26,055
[SPEAKER_13]: Fucking lame bitch, and then they give her own joke.

1191
01:21:26,076 --> 01:21:27,436
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a nobody.

1192
01:21:27,456 --> 01:21:28,656
[SPEAKER_04]: She sucks some guy's dick.

1193
01:21:29,136 --> 01:21:30,396
[SPEAKER_04]: She designs purses.

1194
01:21:30,656 --> 01:21:32,077
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, whoop-dee-doo, she designs purses.

1195
01:21:32,197 --> 01:21:33,177
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1196
01:21:33,197 --> 01:21:39,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, she sucks ass and shouldn't be on here.

1197
01:21:39,738 --> 01:21:42,479
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the sound of Monica Lewinsky sucking shit.

1198
01:21:43,299 --> 01:21:44,499
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, what's she gonna do?

1199

[SPEAKER_15]: Because Madonna...

1211
01:22:12,065 --> 01:22:12,505
[SPEAKER_15]: You bitch.

1212
01:22:13,025 --> 01:22:16,306
[SPEAKER_15]: That new video you have for American Life sucks my balls.

1213
01:22:16,767 --> 01:22:19,647
[SPEAKER_15]: It is the worst, most unimaginative thing I've ever seen in my life.

1214
01:22:20,128 --> 01:22:21,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Your original video was better.

1215
01:22:22,028 --> 01:22:22,829
[SPEAKER_16]: Way, way better.

1216
01:22:22,869 --> 01:22:26,670
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it wasn't the best video you've done, but it was way better than that piece of shit you put on VH1.

1217
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:32,952
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, if you didn't want to ruffle feathers with the whole anti-war thing, even though the video isn't anti-war, it's all like tongue-in-cheek anyway.

1218
01:22:34,042 --> 01:22:37,824
[SPEAKER_16]: Just spend $50 at least to make a decent video.

1219
01:22:37,984 --> 01:22:40,726
[SPEAKER_16]: I did college projects that were better than that shit.

1220
01:22:41,106 --> 01:22:41,907
[SPEAKER_16]: Madonna, you suck.

1221
01:22:42,687 --> 01:22:44,608
[SPEAKER_16]: But the album comes out Tuesday and I'm buying it anyway.

1222
01:22:45,049 --> 01:22:51,312
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, my other FU of the week goes to Muheimer because he says that Kimberly Locke sucks and Kimberly Locke is a goddess.

1223
01:22:51,433 --> 01:22:51,773
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck you.

1224
01:22:58,777 --> 01:23:00,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

1225
01:23:00,418 --> 01:23:01,038
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie has another one.

1226
01:23:01,078 --> 01:23:01,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yes.

1227
01:23:02,802 --> 01:23:21,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck all of you people for watching TV and having rotten minds who only focus on that one tube that puts the picture forth, that your brains are attached to, and your whole life depends on, and you have no social... I have no idea what you're talking about.

1228
01:23:21,748 --> 01:23:22,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Next.

1229
01:23:22,948 --> 01:23:27,610
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't you do that when you play, um, when you're not playing, but it's not a fast game or not a fast game?

1230
01:23:28,683 --> 01:23:28,903
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1231
01:23:48,581 --> 01:23:49,562
[SPEAKER_06]: for being easy.

1232
01:23:50,163 --> 01:23:50,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god.

1233
01:23:51,324 --> 01:23:52,965
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's move on to the rest of the room chat room.

1234
01:23:53,246 --> 01:23:54,407
[SPEAKER_16]: Or the rest of the room FU.

1235
01:23:54,447 --> 01:23:54,827
[SPEAKER_16]: Zero!

1236
01:23:55,668 --> 01:23:56,329
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh no, it's really cool.

1237
01:23:56,389 --> 01:23:57,910
[SPEAKER_17]: I have like a Madonna FU too.

1238
01:23:58,991 --> 01:23:59,372
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1239
01:23:59,552 --> 01:24:02,795
[SPEAKER_17]: No, today I was watching television.

1240
01:24:03,375 --> 01:24:09,922
[SPEAKER_17]: And anyways, they were talking about how she's trying to make an effort against... Okay, but TV.

1241
01:24:11,792 --> 01:24:14,814
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyways, yeah, like I was trying to say as she hops out of the room.

1242
01:24:16,555 --> 01:24:20,197
[SPEAKER_17]: She's trying to combat music piracy also.

1243
01:24:20,617 --> 01:24:27,201
[SPEAKER_17]: She had a bunch of people get online, and she has her actual voice, where, like, you'll download the full length of the song, right?

1244
01:24:27,642 --> 01:24:30,223
[SPEAKER_17]: But it'll just start off, like, the first six seconds is the only thing.

1245
01:24:30,263 --> 01:24:32,424
[SPEAKER_17]: It'll say, what the fuck do you think you're doing?

1246
01:24:33,025 --> 01:24:34,746
[SPEAKER_16]: That was fucking great, actually.

1247
01:24:35,006 --> 01:24:36,227
[SPEAKER_17]: It's funny, but it's like...

1248
01:24:37,429 --> 01:24:39,074
[SPEAKER_17]: You really think you're going to do something.

1249
01:24:39,134 --> 01:24:40,338
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it's not the only one doing that, though.

1250
01:24:40,358 --> 01:24:44,128
[SPEAKER_16]: I tried to download the new Jewel single, Don't Ask Me Why, I just was, and it did the same thing.

1251
01:24:45,248 --> 01:24:46,869
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, if she wasn't going, what the fuck are you looking at?

1252
01:24:46,889 --> 01:24:49,770
[SPEAKER_16]: It just looped the chorus over and over, and I got no doubts on that did that.

1253
01:24:50,050 --> 01:24:51,891
[SPEAKER_16]: People are doing that, all the stuff.

1254
01:24:51,911 --> 01:24:53,071
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, you know what?

1255
01:24:53,111 --> 01:24:54,292
[SPEAKER_19]: That's not going to stop anything.

1256
01:24:54,372 --> 01:24:55,652
[SPEAKER_19]: You can do whatever.

1257
01:24:56,132 --> 01:24:57,733
[SPEAKER_19]: Good luck, RIAA.

1258
01:24:57,833 --> 01:24:58,453
[SPEAKER_13]: You suck.

1259
01:24:58,513 --> 01:25:01,135
[SPEAKER_13]: You're never going to fucking stop us from pirating your music.

1260
01:25:02,395 --> 01:25:04,996
[SPEAKER_13]: I laugh at you wasting billions of dollars trying to try.

1261
01:25:05,316 --> 01:25:05,756
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead.

1262
01:25:05,796 --> 01:25:07,437
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll just go out and find a way around that.

1263
01:25:08,798 --> 01:25:09,238
[SPEAKER_08]: You go, boy.

1264
01:25:11,218 --> 01:25:11,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Zero.

1265
01:25:11,578 --> 01:25:12,359
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not very hard.

1266
01:25:12,779 --> 01:25:15,741
[SPEAKER_17]: No, um, another one, I gotta give an F you to my fucking computer.

1267
01:25:15,921 --> 01:25:18,023
[SPEAKER_17]: No, fuck you to cable, having a cable modem.

1268
01:25:18,283 --> 01:25:20,845
[SPEAKER_17]: I have to burn a fucking CD every goddamn day.

1269
01:25:21,305 --> 01:25:25,348
[SPEAKER_17]: Cause like, first of all, my fucking computer is a piece of shit and has a small hard drive.

1270
01:25:25,968 --> 01:25:27,970
[SPEAKER_17]: I fill it up with music, like, every day.

1271
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:30,051
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have the money for a new fucking hard drive.

1272
01:25:30,932 --> 01:25:32,613
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have the money for that yet, so I get a job.

1273
01:25:32,633 --> 01:25:34,334
[SPEAKER_17]: Wait, I have a job, I start tomorrow, alright.

1274
01:25:34,815 --> 01:25:39,678
[SPEAKER_17]: But anyways, like, I have to burn a CD, I'm already out of fucking CDs because fucking music is too damn good.

1275
01:25:40,956 --> 01:25:45,018
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, and, um, fuck you to, uh, who the fuck is that?

1276
01:25:45,398 --> 01:25:55,942
[SPEAKER_17]: Some stupid bitch yesterday, um, I was, like, walking over to the store, this is in the afternoon, and some stupid bitch at the fucking crosswalk just walks into me!

1277
01:25:56,762 --> 01:25:57,963
[SPEAKER_17]: No fucking reason, this is like...

1278
01:25:59,193 --> 01:26:03,316
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm standing there, I'm pushing the button, that's right, because I was going to get a calling card to call my friend in another country.

1279
01:26:03,837 --> 01:26:11,102
[SPEAKER_17]: And this fucking bitch crosses the street, and, like, I'm not standing on the corner, and she, like, just runs into me and knocks me into the fucking pole.

1280
01:26:12,743 --> 01:26:16,646
[SPEAKER_17]: And I looked at her, and I looked at her, and she, like, said, what the fuck's your problem?

1281
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:19,863
[SPEAKER_17]: I said, I didn't believe you just made up these names.

1282
01:26:39,059 --> 01:26:40,080
[SPEAKER_17]: I just explained the whole story.

1283
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:50,367
[SPEAKER_17]: I was sitting there, and some stupid ChronoCore bitch came and ran into me, knocked me into the bowl on the corner when I was walking up to get a calling card, and she said that, you know, I was a bitch, and she said she was gonna cut me.

1284
01:26:50,407 --> 01:26:51,367
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I called her ChronoCore.

1285
01:26:51,488 --> 01:26:54,209
[SPEAKER_17]: But anyways, that's all my FUs, because that was fucking stupid.

1286
01:26:54,650 --> 01:26:56,151
[SPEAKER_17]: And fuck even not having any more FUs.

1287
01:26:56,591 --> 01:26:56,911
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

1288
01:26:58,412 --> 01:27:00,013
[SPEAKER_16]: Does, um, does Jim have any FUs?

1289
01:27:00,173 --> 01:27:00,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1290
01:27:01,875 --> 01:27:02,835
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, skip Jim for a second.

1291
01:27:03,055 --> 01:27:03,716
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's go to Irene.

1292
01:27:03,736 --> 01:27:03,836
[SPEAKER_16]: Irene.

1293
01:27:04,969 --> 01:27:07,051
[SPEAKER_17]: He's disgruntled, so yeah, there's gonna be a lot of him.

1294
01:27:07,952 --> 01:27:09,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I love this song.

1295
01:27:09,133 --> 01:27:10,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck this song.

1296
01:27:10,414 --> 01:27:22,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you to guys that, like, stare at girls and, you know, oogle at girls, like, in front of their girlfriends, like, and make silly remarks and stuff, like...

1297
01:27:24,378 --> 01:27:27,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, well, maybe I should finish this before Brad gets here, you know, yeah.

1298
01:27:27,623 --> 01:27:35,614
[SPEAKER_05]: And, like, you know, you gotta like a band for more than, you know, just what some chick wears, you know, some stupid corseter.

1299
01:27:36,776 --> 01:27:37,417
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, that too.

1300
01:27:37,637 --> 01:27:38,378
[SPEAKER_16]: I like Switzerland.

1301
01:27:38,439 --> 01:27:39,680
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't Switzerland a great country?

1302
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:40,602
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't you like Switzerland?

1303
01:27:41,813 --> 01:27:42,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up!

1304
01:27:42,273 --> 01:27:42,994
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my F.U.! !

1305
01:27:57,825 --> 01:27:59,647
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, Zero, give the FUs for somebody else.

1306
01:27:59,687 --> 01:28:08,016
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, this is kind of like a battle FU between them, but, like, Dark Child, first off, he says, fuck you to loud-ass bass at 3 o'clock in the morning as he's trying to sleep.

1307
01:28:08,616 --> 01:28:12,640
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I guess apparently, um, Bombay was playing his music a little bit too loud at 3 o'clock in the morning.

1308
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:13,341
[SPEAKER_17]: Kiss, kiss.

1309
01:28:13,802 --> 01:28:16,885
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, well, yeah, that's right, we need to get him some boxes, huh?

1310
01:28:17,882 --> 01:28:23,727
[SPEAKER_06]: No, seriously, I'll come over this week and pack a cell phone for you.

1311
01:28:23,767 --> 01:28:25,308
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you put it on the driveway?

1312
01:28:25,408 --> 01:28:26,709
[SPEAKER_17]: Switzerland's a great place.

1313
01:28:26,869 --> 01:28:28,450
[SPEAKER_17]: Wait, we can do the whole Strong Bad thing.

1314
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:34,955
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe we should put your stereo on the street and find more stuff you'd like to give to me.

1315
01:28:35,115 --> 01:28:35,676
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, the people.

1316
01:28:36,767 --> 01:28:40,550
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll put you in the driveway back over it, except I don't want all that stuff to get in my wheels.

1317
01:28:40,910 --> 01:28:42,692
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, but anyways, yeah, back to that, yeah.

1318
01:28:42,872 --> 01:28:44,473
[SPEAKER_06]: He got pretty pissed off.

1319
01:28:44,893 --> 01:28:49,397
[SPEAKER_17]: And he said that, like, if he wasn't, um, if he wasn't so tired, he would've got up and, like, beat some ass.

1320
01:28:49,977 --> 01:28:50,698
[SPEAKER_17]: I wish he was awake.

1321
01:28:51,358 --> 01:28:56,803
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, and then he says, fuck you to 80s... Hold on!

1322
01:28:57,423 --> 01:29:00,345
[SPEAKER_17]: Damn, fucking 80s, all of a sudden everyone fucks around and gets pissed off.

1323
01:29:00,385 --> 01:29:00,645
[SPEAKER_17]: What?!

1324
01:29:02,307 --> 01:29:03,207
[SPEAKER_17]: Fuck everyone.

1325
01:29:03,668 --> 01:29:05,849
[SPEAKER_17]: No, he says, fuck you to 80s... What you talking about, Zero? 80...

1326
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:07,930
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my god.

1327
01:29:08,631 --> 01:29:09,111
[SPEAKER_17]: Fuck you!

1328
01:29:09,331 --> 01:29:09,971
[SPEAKER_17]: I heard that shit.

1329
01:29:10,512 --> 01:29:17,816
[SPEAKER_17]: No, um, he said, um, fuck you to 80s techno beats and shit because they're all repetitive and looping, and he says they suck ass.

1330
01:29:18,736 --> 01:29:27,701
[SPEAKER_17]: And then, and then the one from DD Alcoholic, she decides to say fuck you to Darkchild because she thinks 80s techno is good.

1331
01:29:28,541 --> 01:29:29,702
[SPEAKER_17]: Anita's a goddess, what can I say?

1332
01:29:30,734 --> 01:29:40,123
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, but I kind of wish that Dark Child was awake in the middle of the night because that would have been funny to hear at 3.30 in the morning he gets up and runs out to, like, kill somebody for techno.

1333
01:29:40,503 --> 01:29:41,004
[SPEAKER_17]: That'd be cool.

1334
01:29:43,946 --> 01:29:44,347
[SPEAKER_17]: Rawr.

1335
01:29:44,647 --> 01:29:45,047
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I'm done.

1336
01:29:47,458 --> 01:29:55,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of the 80s, and back sort of reminding me of the conversation from earlier, fuck you to Captain N, the Game Master.

1337
01:29:55,623 --> 01:29:57,364
[SPEAKER_17]: Holy shit, I downloaded a bunch of episodes.

1338
01:29:57,384 --> 01:29:58,865
[SPEAKER_06]: That show sucked ass.

1339
01:29:58,885 --> 01:30:03,909
[SPEAKER_06]: That show was the worst ever, because... And skewed so many of my viewpoints in video game history.

1340
01:30:04,029 --> 01:30:08,271
[SPEAKER_17]: Simon was a lot more, like, ballsy-er than they made him to be.

1341
01:30:10,073 --> 01:30:11,173
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, fuck that show.

1342
01:30:11,233 --> 01:30:12,234
[SPEAKER_06]: I just had a memory of that show.

1343
01:30:12,254 --> 01:30:15,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I'm going to start following things.

1344
01:30:23,545 --> 01:30:26,787
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1345
01:30:26,847 --> 01:30:32,511
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of vague on my FUs, really.

1346
01:30:33,312 --> 01:30:37,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't think of many particular things, but... Shit.

1347
01:30:38,956 --> 01:30:39,476
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1348
01:30:39,496 --> 01:30:44,079
[SPEAKER_09]: FU, really, to... Hey, you mentioned reality shows and shit like that.

1349
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:44,760
[SPEAKER_09]: And so...

1350
01:30:45,527 --> 01:30:55,449
[SPEAKER_09]: A fair amount of the people who actually watch that shit who, you know, seems to have no real purpose in their lives to spend hours on end in the days to watch this shit all the time.

1351
01:30:55,469 --> 01:30:56,830
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what you're talking about, asshole.

1352
01:31:00,911 --> 01:31:05,992
[SPEAKER_09]: I honestly can't stand this reality BS because it's not exactly reality.

1353
01:31:06,627 --> 01:31:07,567
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I don't agree.

1354
01:31:07,927 --> 01:31:10,008
[SPEAKER_16]: The reality movie, that's too much.

1355
01:31:10,848 --> 01:31:11,529
[SPEAKER_16]: Exactly.

1356
01:31:12,229 --> 01:31:13,169
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't even go there!

1357
01:31:13,389 --> 01:31:16,310
[SPEAKER_14]: Fucking, that's the dumbest fucking thing I've ever seen!

1358
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:17,570
[SPEAKER_14]: Goddamn real world!

1359
01:31:18,031 --> 01:31:18,611
[SPEAKER_14]: Die!

1360
01:31:19,871 --> 01:31:23,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, it went up in yellow.

1361
01:31:23,712 --> 01:31:24,413
[SPEAKER_04]: That was cool.

1362
01:31:24,593 --> 01:31:25,473
[SPEAKER_04]: And your face is purple.

1363
01:31:26,253 --> 01:31:28,374
[SPEAKER_16]: My ears are bleeding and your face is purple, Jim.

1364
01:31:29,834 --> 01:31:30,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, yeah.

1365
01:31:30,755 --> 01:31:30,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

1366
01:31:34,744 --> 01:31:35,965
[SPEAKER_09]: God, I got a scatterbrain right now.

1367
01:31:35,985 --> 01:31:37,126
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't think of many FUs.

1368
01:31:37,426 --> 01:31:44,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Um... This is my dark side talking.

1369
01:31:44,131 --> 01:31:50,657
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, fuck you to the entire human race because, you know, you are the plague that is eating this planet alive.

1370
01:31:51,337 --> 01:31:56,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, exactly... Getting on a little Matrix feel, exactly what Agent Smith said.

1371
01:31:57,182 --> 01:31:59,924
[SPEAKER_09]: We are a virus.

1372
01:32:00,004 --> 01:32:00,644
[SPEAKER_09]: We are a...

1373
01:32:03,254 --> 01:32:05,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Parasite to this planet.

1374
01:32:06,157 --> 01:32:11,243
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we're pretty much just going to do that shit to every other planet we meet up in along the way.

1375
01:32:12,204 --> 01:32:15,488
[SPEAKER_09]: But, yeah, that's it.

1376
01:32:17,528 --> 01:32:17,849
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1377
01:32:18,109 --> 01:32:18,970
[SPEAKER_16]: Chatroom FUs.

1378
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:21,572
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck the chatroom FUs.

1379
01:32:21,612 --> 01:32:22,573
[SPEAKER_16]: DDR Angel.

1380
01:32:22,673 --> 01:32:29,059
[SPEAKER_16]: My first FU goes to those stupid people, companies, whatever, that send you those damn text messages to your phone wanting you to buy their shit.

1381
01:32:29,119 --> 01:32:29,579
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't care.

1382
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:30,440
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't need your crap.

1383
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:34,064
[SPEAKER_16]: And stop wasting my monthly 200 text messages there for my friends and not you.

1384
01:32:34,164 --> 01:32:34,524
[SPEAKER_16]: Grr.

1385
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:37,967
[SPEAKER_16]: FU to my work schedule because I'm going to miss a lot of Orange Ons Radio this week.

1386
01:32:38,167 --> 01:32:38,588
[SPEAKER_16]: FU to that.

1387
01:32:39,204 --> 01:32:39,644
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1388
01:32:39,724 --> 01:32:41,424
[SPEAKER_06]: You can just get free text messaging like I have.

1389
01:32:41,764 --> 01:32:44,365
[SPEAKER_16]: I would also recommend suing the companies that are sending that shit to you.

1390
01:32:44,825 --> 01:32:47,005
[SPEAKER_06]: You can.

1391
01:32:47,085 --> 01:32:55,167
[SPEAKER_16]: John Fields says, F you to people calling me a cult leader and trying to sue me for killing someone when that person is still alive and they know that person is alive.

1392
01:32:56,467 --> 01:32:56,747
[SPEAKER_16]: Huh?

1393
01:32:56,767 --> 01:32:58,748
[SPEAKER_16]: That was scary.

1394
01:32:58,768 --> 01:33:00,588
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to be a cult leader.

1395
01:33:00,628 --> 01:33:04,629
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait, F you to that person who caused it by faking their own death to get off the net.

1396
01:33:06,129 --> 01:33:06,529
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow.

1397
01:33:06,549 --> 01:33:06,609
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow.

1398
01:33:08,774 --> 01:33:14,178
[SPEAKER_16]: One more, F you to not being able to DDR more than one game because of not having enough energy even after a full night of sleep.

1399
01:33:14,438 --> 01:33:15,238
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait, let me go back to this.

1400
01:33:15,578 --> 01:33:24,604
[SPEAKER_16]: Somebody faked their own death on the internet, and then this guy, our guy in the chatroom, Jon Fields, gets blamed as being a cult leader and gets sued for killing that person.

1401
01:33:24,844 --> 01:33:27,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, first of all... How the hell did that happen?

1402
01:33:27,506 --> 01:33:33,269
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, the whole faking your whole death thing on the internet, if anyone falls for that bullshit, they're so stupid.

1403
01:33:34,230 --> 01:33:34,510
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?

1404
01:33:36,219 --> 01:33:41,282
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had people try to pull that stuff and then I just traced their IP and found other places that they're posting.

1405
01:33:45,025 --> 01:33:46,105
[SPEAKER_16]: That is so weird.

1406
01:33:46,605 --> 01:33:46,966
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow.

1407
01:33:47,026 --> 01:33:47,946
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so stupid.

1408
01:33:48,286 --> 01:33:51,168
[SPEAKER_16]: As the internet turns, as the world wide web turns.

1409
01:33:52,209 --> 01:33:57,092
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, ViolentHyperGirl would like to give a big FU to AP practice exams and bitchy club advisors.

1410
01:33:57,692 --> 01:34:03,836
[SPEAKER_16]: Another FU to the MilpitasGolfLand AZN idiots who think they're good and then run away from the machine when I start freestyling.

1411
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:10,099
[SPEAKER_16]: Moohimer would like to say, fuck stupid friends again.

1412
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:15,961
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck almost going to Ocean City to play DDR, but then my parents are being like, uh, no, but I'm going Tuesday anyway.

1413
01:34:16,201 --> 01:34:16,761
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what's funny?

1414
01:34:16,861 --> 01:34:27,023
[SPEAKER_16]: Ocean City is that town, you ever drive through Sacramento and it's like where Highway 50 starts, and they have like, oh, Sacramento's this far away, and Lake Tahoe's this far away, and then Ocean City, Maryland is this far away, because that's where Highway 50 ends.

1415
01:34:27,103 --> 01:34:28,123
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't that funny?

1416
01:34:29,643 --> 01:34:30,204
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

1417
01:34:30,384 --> 01:34:31,164
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought it was funny, I don't know.

1418
01:34:31,284 --> 01:34:32,084
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, Rob!

1419
01:34:32,364 --> 01:34:37,205
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck online games for being so addicting, although I must say, SissyFight.com is strangely fun.

1420
01:34:40,014 --> 01:34:40,874
[SPEAKER_16]: I have to visit that site.

1421
01:34:40,914 --> 01:34:41,874
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck bag in the background.

1422
01:34:42,195 --> 01:34:42,775
[SPEAKER_16]: Eh, whatever.

1423
01:34:43,975 --> 01:34:44,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I picked that too.

1424
01:34:44,995 --> 01:34:48,556
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkTetsuya would like to give an F you to all the spam I've been getting lately.

1425
01:34:49,336 --> 01:34:50,097
[SPEAKER_16]: Build a sculpture.

1426
01:34:51,177 --> 01:34:53,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, that's why you block it.

1427
01:34:53,978 --> 01:34:59,359
[SPEAKER_16]: F you to QDChaser's heavy steps on the extreme not matching DDR Max's USAs.

1428
01:35:05,077 --> 01:35:10,060
[SPEAKER_16]: Skyline would like to say a big F you to boring eventless spring breaks.

1429
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:11,081
[SPEAKER_16]: Now I'm fat again.

1430
01:35:12,242 --> 01:35:13,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, poor baby.

1431
01:35:15,084 --> 01:35:17,766
[SPEAKER_16]: Stop watching reality TV and go play some DDR.

1432
01:35:18,346 --> 01:35:19,927
[SPEAKER_16]: Fraternity life sucks also.

1433
01:35:19,947 --> 01:35:20,868
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd just like you to know.

1434
01:35:21,328 --> 01:35:23,810
[SPEAKER_16]: If someone hates reality TV, you're watching an awful lot of it.

1435
01:35:23,930 --> 01:35:25,090
[SPEAKER_16]: I was bored yesterday.

1436
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:26,151
[SPEAKER_16]: It was all I was on.

1437
01:35:26,191 --> 01:35:28,553
[SPEAKER_16]: I was waiting for a show I'll talk about later.

1438
01:35:29,393 --> 01:35:32,515
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, Japan Man would like to say fuck me for forgetting the show.

1439
01:35:32,596 --> 01:35:33,016
[SPEAKER_16]: That is all.

1440
01:35:33,939 --> 01:35:34,579
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, fuck you!

1441
01:35:34,619 --> 01:35:35,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, fuck you!

1442
01:35:35,359 --> 01:35:36,320
[SPEAKER_16]: No, just kidding, it's cool.

1443
01:35:36,460 --> 01:35:36,760
[SPEAKER_16]: It happens.

1444
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:37,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you, man!

1445
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:39,341
[SPEAKER_16]: I almost forgot the show today.

1446
01:35:39,861 --> 01:35:45,283
[SPEAKER_16]: Japan Man would also like to say, Fuck certain people that make fun of me when I fail on Bag, and I'm 50 times better than them.

1447
01:35:46,163 --> 01:35:48,584
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck memories on Naoki Neo Standard.

1448
01:35:48,884 --> 01:35:50,144
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a bitch, but I finally beat it.

1449
01:35:50,184 --> 01:35:50,504
[SPEAKER_16]: Woo!

1450
01:35:51,265 --> 01:35:52,225
[SPEAKER_16]: And, uh, what the fuck?

1451
01:35:52,265 --> 01:35:54,666
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck the test our state makes us take every fucking year.

1452
01:35:54,746 --> 01:35:55,046
[SPEAKER_16]: Die.

1453
01:35:56,437 --> 01:35:57,058
[SPEAKER_16]: That was so Jimmy.

1454
01:35:58,619 --> 01:35:58,980
[SPEAKER_16]: It's alright.

1455
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:03,564
[SPEAKER_16]: Bryce, RYC3, that's why I said it, so Jimmy.

1456
01:36:03,704 --> 01:36:12,052
[SPEAKER_16]: RYC3 would like to say, fuck you dumb fucks in SoCal, guys, who have no chance on getting with the girls they want to get with, then later crying over it to me because they got rejected.

1457
01:36:12,453 --> 01:36:13,333
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck you to being single.

1458
01:36:13,594 --> 01:36:13,854
[SPEAKER_16]: Amen.

1459
01:36:14,234 --> 01:36:18,779
[SPEAKER_16]: Fuck you to kids, preteens at work, testing my patience in the counter, giving prizes for tickets.

1460
01:36:22,052 --> 01:36:24,993
[SPEAKER_16]: 23rd Magus would like to say, here's my big old list.

1461
01:36:25,613 --> 01:36:26,353
[SPEAKER_16]: F you to Kentucky.

1462
01:36:26,533 --> 01:36:27,833
[SPEAKER_16]: F you to spending a week in Kentucky.

1463
01:36:28,053 --> 01:36:29,253
[SPEAKER_16]: F you to the flight to Kentucky.

1464
01:36:29,713 --> 01:36:31,694
[SPEAKER_16]: F you to turbulence on the flight back to Kentucky.

1465
01:36:31,914 --> 01:36:34,534
[SPEAKER_16]: F you to having to leech money off mom to buy Angel a ring in Kentucky.

1466
01:36:34,574 --> 01:36:35,354
[SPEAKER_16]: Hands Angel a ring.

1467
01:36:35,935 --> 01:36:39,435
[SPEAKER_16]: F you to getting mom's IP banned from DJ Bad while I was in Kentucky.

1468
01:36:39,895 --> 01:36:41,696
[SPEAKER_16]: F you to missing Orange Lounge while I was in Kentucky.

1469
01:36:42,196 --> 01:36:44,956
[SPEAKER_16]: F you to having nothing to do in Kentucky, but pretty much F you to Kentucky.

1470
01:36:46,076 --> 01:36:46,336
[SPEAKER_16]: Zing.

1471
01:36:47,577 --> 01:36:49,297
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I would have said F you to Kentucky.

1472
01:36:51,638 --> 01:36:52,999
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to know if you brought back chicken.

1473
01:37:00,223 --> 01:37:05,806
[SPEAKER_16]: MoreThanJake543, F you to boring breaks, false hope, sporks not being made out of metal.

1474
01:37:06,166 --> 01:37:06,806
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a good one.

1475
01:37:07,887 --> 01:37:12,790
[SPEAKER_16]: People who think punk is fashion, and when you send your F you's to the wrong person.

1476
01:37:14,210 --> 01:37:17,451
[SPEAKER_16]: and the fact that I lost my Battle Royale in my hard drive crash of last week.

1477
01:37:17,812 --> 01:37:18,972
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yes, F you to American Idol.

1478
01:37:18,992 --> 01:37:20,073
[SPEAKER_06]: I can replace that.

1479
01:37:22,674 --> 01:37:24,774
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, actually, I need to throw in one more fuck you.

1480
01:37:25,675 --> 01:37:33,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you to 800 megabyte, um, uh, BenQ files that I don't have the disks that are capable of burning Battle Royale to right now.

1481
01:37:34,399 --> 01:37:34,819
[SPEAKER_16]: Zip them up?

1482
01:37:35,019 --> 01:37:35,419
[SPEAKER_16]: Does it work?

1483
01:37:35,919 --> 01:37:39,521
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's the file to burn to BenQ.

1484
01:37:40,001 --> 01:37:41,742
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't copy the file off.

1485
01:37:41,942 --> 01:37:42,402
[SPEAKER_19]: That's weird.

1486
01:37:43,530 --> 01:37:45,992
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, they do have things to rip being Q files.

1487
01:37:47,052 --> 01:37:48,073
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about that.

1488
01:37:48,093 --> 01:37:51,335
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about the file itself being too big to burn to a CD.

1489
01:37:54,837 --> 01:37:56,798
[SPEAKER_16]: Vid Powwow would like to say, F you to school.

1490
01:37:56,938 --> 01:37:58,339
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to go back after vacation.

1491
01:37:58,699 --> 01:38:01,861
[SPEAKER_16]: And F you to myself for bringing all the things needed to play 2DX at a party.

1492
01:38:01,921 --> 01:38:02,722
[SPEAKER_16]: Except the controller!

1493
01:38:04,683 --> 01:38:05,364
[SPEAKER_06]: That was funny.

1494
01:38:05,384 --> 01:38:05,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Who was that?

1495
01:38:06,264 --> 01:38:06,764
[SPEAKER_16]: Vid Powwow.

1496
01:38:08,606 --> 01:38:08,986
[SPEAKER_16]: Teehee.

1497
01:38:11,671 --> 01:38:17,397
[SPEAKER_16]: ElectroTal, our old friend, that would like to say F you to whoever fucked up Sakpamani.

1498
01:38:18,518 --> 01:38:20,980
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, that would be our good friends at $1hosting.com.

1499
01:38:21,221 --> 01:38:28,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, fuck them and fuck DuploWeb for going away, and fuck WebCountry, who owns $1hosting.

1500
01:38:28,648 --> 01:38:32,291
[SPEAKER_06]: So look for the coming of Sakpamani.org.

1501
01:38:33,527 --> 01:38:36,808
[SPEAKER_06]: With a subdomain, cybermoney.org, fuck you.

1502
01:38:37,309 --> 01:38:38,469
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1503
01:38:39,109 --> 01:38:41,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you and bellarhosting.com.

1504
01:38:42,191 --> 01:38:42,691
[SPEAKER_16]: Sounds good to me.

1505
01:38:42,971 --> 01:38:45,192
[SPEAKER_16]: ViolentHypergold gives one last FU.

1506
01:38:45,892 --> 01:38:48,714
[SPEAKER_16]: FU to my stupid computer that likes to reset itself for no apparent reason.

1507
01:38:48,774 --> 01:38:50,014
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not even an old computer.

1508
01:38:52,415 --> 01:38:54,936
[SPEAKER_16]: And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the one hour long FUs of the week.

1509
01:38:54,976 --> 01:38:55,697
[SPEAKER_16]: Congratulations.

1510
01:38:55,737 --> 01:38:55,977
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay.

1511
01:38:56,097 --> 01:38:56,697
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay.

1512
01:38:59,275 --> 01:39:00,416
[SPEAKER_16]: You know why your computer resets?

1513
01:39:00,616 --> 01:39:00,816
[SPEAKER_16]: Why?

1514
01:39:01,096 --> 01:39:05,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Because probably your fan on your heat sink is dirty and your computer's overheating.

1515
01:39:06,938 --> 01:39:07,479
[SPEAKER_13]: Check that.

1516
01:39:10,540 --> 01:39:13,541
[SPEAKER_13]: No, seriously, Punk Knight's computer used to do that reset for no reason.

1517
01:39:13,561 --> 01:39:18,724
[SPEAKER_13]: We found out that his fan was jammed from moving by a bunch of dust.

1518
01:39:19,244 --> 01:39:19,644
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yeah.

1519
01:39:23,257 --> 01:39:24,618
[SPEAKER_16]: How about we do the cage match now?

1520
01:39:24,958 --> 01:39:26,039
[SPEAKER_16]: The system is down.

1521
01:39:26,679 --> 01:39:27,780
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's do the cage match now.

1522
01:39:27,860 --> 01:39:28,360
[SPEAKER_16]: That'll be fun.

1523
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:28,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1524
01:39:28,981 --> 01:39:29,801
[SPEAKER_16]: That'll be a fun one.

1525
01:39:30,682 --> 01:39:31,282
[SPEAKER_16]: This'll be fun.

1526
01:39:31,442 --> 01:39:35,205
[SPEAKER_06]: And then while we're compiling those, we can do Son of a Bitch after that.

1527
01:39:35,225 --> 01:39:38,347
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, so I'm giving us time to do listless while the cage match songs are playing.

1528
01:39:38,447 --> 01:39:39,248
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll start handing out paper.

1529
01:39:39,528 --> 01:39:40,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like a good idea.

1530
01:39:41,129 --> 01:39:43,310
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so, hold on, I'm bringing up cage match.

1531
01:39:46,974 --> 01:39:48,494
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, so hi, how was your week?

1532
01:39:49,054 --> 01:39:49,935
[SPEAKER_16]: While I get my music.

1533
01:39:49,955 --> 01:39:51,075
[SPEAKER_06]: My week was unemployed.

1534
01:39:51,475 --> 01:39:54,235
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't sleep most of the week.

1535
01:39:54,255 --> 01:39:56,096
[SPEAKER_16]: How many fuck-off shows did you do this week?

1536
01:39:56,996 --> 01:39:57,116
[SPEAKER_06]: One.

1537
01:39:57,456 --> 01:39:57,836
[SPEAKER_16]: Only one?

1538
01:39:58,096 --> 01:39:58,996
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I may have done two.

1539
01:39:59,216 --> 01:39:59,576
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe two.

1540
01:40:00,097 --> 01:40:03,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be doing a fuck-off show, though, on Tuesday night, I'm sure.

1541
01:40:03,837 --> 01:40:04,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

1542
01:40:04,657 --> 01:40:04,957
[SPEAKER_16]: Good job.

1543
01:40:06,058 --> 01:40:08,438
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that's one reason you've got to listen to Orange Lounge Radio all the time.

1544
01:40:08,578 --> 01:40:10,038
[SPEAKER_16]: Our Bumani Music War Program gives the surprises.

1545
01:40:10,138 --> 01:40:10,619
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a tonight.

1546
01:40:14,406 --> 01:40:16,007
[SPEAKER_16]: Not bad, not bad.

1547
01:40:16,207 --> 01:40:17,748
[SPEAKER_16]: That's more than we get on some of these shows.

1548
01:40:18,228 --> 01:40:22,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I had nine listeners at 7 a.m.

1549
01:40:22,710 --> 01:40:23,011
[SPEAKER_06]: one day.

1550
01:40:23,311 --> 01:40:24,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Which for internet radio is amazingly good.

1551
01:40:24,972 --> 01:40:28,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I did a fuck-off show from 11.30 p.m.

1552
01:40:28,694 --> 01:40:30,194
[SPEAKER_06]: until 8 in the morning.

1553
01:40:32,035 --> 01:40:33,776
[SPEAKER_19]: So are we ever going to be featured on Satellite Radio?

1554
01:40:33,796 --> 01:40:34,577
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that's what I want to know.

1555
01:40:35,559 --> 01:40:37,000
[SPEAKER_16]: I still say we need to get on G4.

1556
01:40:37,020 --> 01:40:39,101
[SPEAKER_16]: With some of the crap they have on there, Orange Lounge would fit right in.

1557
01:40:39,542 --> 01:40:39,802
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1558
01:40:39,822 --> 01:40:41,603
[SPEAKER_16]: Cool.

1559
01:40:41,703 --> 01:40:44,865
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's go to this week's Cage Max, shall we, ladies and gents?

1560
01:40:44,885 --> 01:40:46,086
[SPEAKER_16]: I just called it Cage Max.

1561
01:40:47,326 --> 01:40:48,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Max!

1562
01:40:49,267 --> 01:40:49,728
[SPEAKER_16]: Help me.

1563
01:40:51,329 --> 01:40:53,250
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, here we go with tonight's Cage Max.

1564
01:40:54,668 --> 01:40:56,768
[SPEAKER_16]: Last week... Boys and girls.

1565
01:40:57,409 --> 01:40:57,749
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1566
01:40:59,649 --> 01:41:00,109
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, hi.

1567
01:41:00,689 --> 01:41:04,890
[SPEAKER_16]: Last week in the cage match, Loki won it with a song called Duck Toy by Hampenberg.

1568
01:41:04,930 --> 01:41:05,850
[SPEAKER_16]: And here is a clip.

1569
01:41:06,591 --> 01:41:12,192
[SPEAKER_16]: The way the cage match works, you can vote for either Loki's song, DarkSakura's song, or my song.

1570
01:41:12,912 --> 01:41:17,293
[SPEAKER_16]: And the winning song gets to go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.

1571
01:41:17,613 --> 01:41:20,273
[SPEAKER_16]: Except Duck Toy never went into rotation because I never got a copy of the MP3.

1572
01:41:20,334 --> 01:41:20,874
[SPEAKER_16]: Oops.

1573
01:41:21,294 --> 01:41:21,554
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh well.

1574
01:41:22,034 --> 01:41:22,194
[SPEAKER_16]: So...

1575
01:41:22,794 --> 01:41:24,378
[SPEAKER_16]: Here it is, though, one more time for you.

1576
01:41:24,518 --> 01:41:26,382
[SPEAKER_16]: It could still win tonight if you want to vote for it.

1577
01:41:26,442 --> 01:41:27,985
[SPEAKER_16]: The first entry in tonight's cage match.

1578
01:41:28,005 --> 01:41:29,769
[SPEAKER_16]: Here's a clip of Hamperberg with DuckToy.

1579
01:41:54,838 --> 01:41:56,086
Thanks for watching!

1580
01:42:43,912 --> 01:42:44,452
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1581
01:42:44,993 --> 01:42:46,894
[SPEAKER_16]: That was Hamperberg with Duck Toy.

1582
01:42:47,454 --> 01:42:49,975
[SPEAKER_16]: That was last week's winner in Orange Lounge Radio's cage match.

1583
01:42:49,995 --> 01:42:50,676
[SPEAKER_16]: You can vote for that.

1584
01:42:50,696 --> 01:42:51,376
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the first song.

1585
01:42:52,049 --> 01:42:53,850
[SPEAKER_16]: or you can vote for my pick this week.

1586
01:42:54,870 --> 01:43:02,173
[SPEAKER_16]: I promised Irene like four weeks ago I'd do this song and I didn't because I kept finding better stuff like Freeze Pop.

1587
01:43:04,294 --> 01:43:07,615
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what?

1588
01:43:07,715 --> 01:43:09,035
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll put in Super Spro tonight.

1589
01:43:09,135 --> 01:43:09,476
[SPEAKER_16]: I will.

1590
01:43:09,876 --> 01:43:10,416
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't push me.

1591
01:43:10,896 --> 01:43:11,156
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1592
01:43:13,437 --> 01:43:14,998
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I want to do a different artist tonight.

1593
01:43:15,018 --> 01:43:18,039
[SPEAKER_17]: You should at least be happy you won that game.

1594
01:43:18,059 --> 01:43:18,939
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that was funny.

1595
01:43:18,999 --> 01:43:21,220
[SPEAKER_16]: It was only because we got into a fight on air, but that was cool.

1596
01:43:21,941 --> 01:43:30,264
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, okay, my pick tonight is actually a band I put in the cage match like way, like probably the first or second cage match I put this band in, and they lost.

1597
01:43:31,004 --> 01:43:32,485
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's okay because they're going to win tonight, right?

1598
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:37,744
[SPEAKER_16]: This band is called Olive, and they're a cool little trip-hop band from a few years ago.

1599
01:43:37,804 --> 01:43:38,725
[SPEAKER_16]: They were big a couple years ago.

1600
01:43:38,745 --> 01:43:39,585
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if they're still around.

1601
01:43:39,605 --> 01:43:40,366
[SPEAKER_16]: Are they still around, Irene?

1602
01:43:40,386 --> 01:43:41,527
[SPEAKER_16]: You're the one that made me put this song in.

1603
01:43:44,550 --> 01:43:46,111
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, whatever.

1604
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:49,975
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, no, I think they do still do stuff recently, because I think this song was on the Next Best Thing soundtrack.

1605
01:43:49,995 --> 01:43:50,696
[SPEAKER_16]: That's where it came from.

1606
01:43:50,756 --> 01:43:56,521
[SPEAKER_16]: This song is called, it's a cover of an old 70s song, and it's called I'm Not In Love.

1607
01:43:56,901 --> 01:43:57,622
[SPEAKER_16]: So enjoy.

1608
01:43:57,642 --> 01:43:58,403
[SPEAKER_16]: This song is cool.

1609
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:16,913
I'm not in love, so don't forget it It's just a silly thing I'm going through

1610
01:44:38,581 --> 01:44:39,566
[SPEAKER_02]: and just because

1611
01:46:47,375 --> 01:46:48,379
Thanks for watching!

1612
01:48:26,252 --> 01:48:26,752
[SPEAKER_16]: Oopies!

1613
01:48:26,892 --> 01:48:27,293
[SPEAKER_16]: Oopies!

1614
01:48:27,833 --> 01:48:29,013
[SPEAKER_16]: I ended that one a little soon.

1615
01:48:29,053 --> 01:48:29,414
[SPEAKER_16]: That's alright.

1616
01:48:29,434 --> 01:48:29,854
[SPEAKER_16]: That was the end.

1617
01:48:29,874 --> 01:48:30,834
[SPEAKER_16]: Those last ten seconds of it.

1618
01:48:31,194 --> 01:48:37,518
[SPEAKER_16]: That was Olive with I'm... That was Olive with I'm Not In Love.

1619
01:48:38,158 --> 01:48:39,479
[SPEAKER_16]: What did you kids think of that one?

1620
01:48:44,101 --> 01:48:46,202
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't really listening.

1621
01:48:46,812 --> 01:48:59,676
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not in love I'm not in love with that song You're so punny No, I'm really not, that was the worst song ever That was almost as bad as Freeze Pod

1622
01:49:16,932 --> 01:49:19,093
[SPEAKER_17]: I give it a two, because it sucks.

1623
01:49:19,173 --> 01:49:19,673
[SPEAKER_16]: You bitch.

1624
01:49:20,133 --> 01:49:20,833
[SPEAKER_16]: It sucks!

1625
01:49:20,853 --> 01:49:22,754
[SPEAKER_16]: You're never going to like a song I put in Cage Match.

1626
01:49:22,954 --> 01:49:23,474
[SPEAKER_16]: You could die.

1627
01:49:23,634 --> 01:49:25,214
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, but I won one for you, didn't I?

1628
01:49:25,854 --> 01:49:26,234
[SPEAKER_27]: Whatever.

1629
01:49:26,755 --> 01:49:27,415
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, fine.

1630
01:49:27,795 --> 01:49:29,095
[SPEAKER_17]: You didn't win that week either.

1631
01:49:29,395 --> 01:49:32,876
[SPEAKER_17]: You lost, if it wasn't for me and Tile fighting.

1632
01:49:33,536 --> 01:49:34,037
[SPEAKER_17]: You suck.

1633
01:49:34,617 --> 01:49:35,377
[SPEAKER_17]: Tim, what did you think?

1634
01:49:37,417 --> 01:49:38,278
[SPEAKER_17]: One to ten scale.

1635
01:49:41,739 --> 01:49:42,559
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like it that much.

1636
01:49:44,178 --> 01:49:44,878
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you give it?

1637
01:49:45,199 --> 01:49:45,899
[SPEAKER_15]: On a 1 to a 10.

1638
01:49:48,321 --> 01:49:49,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Will you stop that?

1639
01:49:49,581 --> 01:49:49,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop it!

1640
01:49:52,263 --> 01:49:53,204
[SPEAKER_09]: I will decide my own.

1641
01:49:54,024 --> 01:49:58,847
[SPEAKER_09]: I will give it a... It's a decent song, actually.

1642
01:49:59,908 --> 01:50:03,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Some might actually pick, but I have to say I'd give it probably a 4.

1643
01:50:04,951 --> 01:50:05,211
[SPEAKER_09]: 4 or 5.

1644
01:50:06,012 --> 01:50:06,472
[SPEAKER_16]: Wonderful.

1645
01:50:06,772 --> 01:50:07,773
[SPEAKER_16]: Irene, what did you think?

1646
01:50:08,613 --> 01:50:09,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I know who picked it, so...

1647
01:50:17,686 --> 01:50:21,128
[SPEAKER_16]: I give it a 9.9 because it's sexy but not as sexy as me.

1648
01:50:21,148 --> 01:50:27,051
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you know who I am?

1649
01:50:27,991 --> 01:50:36,556
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, I should have said not as sexy as Dr. J. Alright, one more pick for this week's cage match and it comes from Miss Dark Sakura.

1650
01:50:36,576 --> 01:50:36,916
[SPEAKER_16]: What is it?

1651
01:50:37,498 --> 01:50:42,922
[SPEAKER_06]: This was a song that I, I don't, I was like, oh my god, I need a song, I'll pick this one.

1652
01:50:44,283 --> 01:50:45,104
[SPEAKER_06]: But I really like it.

1653
01:50:45,984 --> 01:50:46,465
[SPEAKER_16]: What's it called?

1654
01:50:47,646 --> 01:50:49,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Phantom of the Opera something or the other remix, I don't know.

1655
01:50:50,348 --> 01:50:53,110
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, this is a Phantom of the Opera something or other remix, enjoy.

1656
01:55:06,198 --> 01:55:07,079
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, we're back.

1657
01:55:08,080 --> 01:55:12,084
[SPEAKER_16]: That was the Phantom of the Opera techno remix.

1658
01:55:12,584 --> 01:55:13,886
[SPEAKER_16]: Going around the room, what did you think, Jamie?

1659
01:55:14,437 --> 01:55:19,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I could have found better if I had tried, so I give it an eight and a half.

1660
01:55:20,299 --> 01:55:20,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero?

1661
01:55:22,180 --> 01:55:27,422
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I absolutely love the finale of the opera, but I really like the original a lot more than that.

1662
01:55:28,143 --> 01:55:35,666
[SPEAKER_18]: And so, even though it was a good remix, uh, technomics of it, I'll give it, like, an eight, because it was still pretty decent, even though it could have been better.

1663
01:55:37,301 --> 01:55:40,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, what'd you think?

1664
01:56:03,762 --> 01:56:08,586
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, I heard this a long ass time ago, way before I started doing this show.

1665
01:56:09,206 --> 01:56:10,227
[SPEAKER_19]: That's how old it is.

1666
01:56:10,527 --> 01:56:11,207
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, food!

1667
01:56:11,648 --> 01:56:12,548
[SPEAKER_19]: You went to McDonald's instead?

1668
01:56:12,568 --> 01:56:13,529
[SPEAKER_12]: Keep going, keep going, keep going.

1669
01:56:15,030 --> 01:56:15,971
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I don't give a shit.

1670
01:56:16,271 --> 01:56:19,333
[SPEAKER_14]: If you got me the two cheeseburger meal with super size, I love you.

1671
01:56:22,071 --> 01:56:24,872
[SPEAKER_16]: I give it an 8, but vote for my song.

1672
01:56:52,092 --> 01:56:55,633
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I thought it was, it was pretty decent.

1673
01:56:55,873 --> 01:56:57,614
[SPEAKER_16]: It was, it was a decent mix.

1674
01:56:58,234 --> 01:56:59,955
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I'll give it, uh, 8.

1675
01:57:00,075 --> 01:57:01,535
[SPEAKER_16]: I can totally see that mix in DDR.

1676
01:57:01,976 --> 01:57:06,297
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so, really quick, you guys, here's clips of the three songs you can vote for tonight.

1677
01:57:06,537 --> 01:57:09,418
[SPEAKER_16]: First one, last week's winner, Hamperberg with Duck Toy.

1678
01:57:16,951 --> 01:57:17,972
[SPEAKER_16]: Don't vote for that one.

1679
01:57:18,212 --> 01:57:19,514
[SPEAKER_16]: Vote for someone else's.

1680
01:57:19,674 --> 01:57:20,475
[SPEAKER_16]: Vote for Rob's.

1681
01:57:20,595 --> 01:57:22,297
[SPEAKER_16]: You can vote for Olive with I'm Not In Love.

1682
01:57:31,048 --> 01:57:33,812
[SPEAKER_16]: Or you can vote for Phantom of the Opera, The Technomix.

1683
01:57:46,121 --> 01:57:46,921
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

1684
01:58:07,762 --> 01:58:08,943
[SPEAKER_16]: You've won, like, what, one?

1685
01:58:09,164 --> 01:58:09,464
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1686
01:58:09,864 --> 01:58:11,086
[SPEAKER_16]: You can vote for me as a pity.

1687
01:58:11,106 --> 01:58:12,007
[SPEAKER_17]: You deserve to win one.

1688
01:58:12,187 --> 01:58:14,249
[SPEAKER_16]: All votes for DuckToy go to Rob.

1689
01:58:15,030 --> 01:58:16,312
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I don't want that song to win.

1690
01:58:16,732 --> 01:58:17,073
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

1691
01:58:17,954 --> 01:58:24,421
[SPEAKER_16]: Usually we don't go to a musical break right after Cage Match, but there's a little chaotic because we just had food brought into the room, so people are scrounging for food.

1692
01:58:24,441 --> 01:58:26,123
[SPEAKER_28]: So we're going to take a quickie, quickie break.

1693
01:58:26,663 --> 01:58:27,824
[SPEAKER_16]: and we will be right back.

1694
01:58:28,205 --> 01:58:30,227
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're going to have tonight's list list when we get back.

1695
01:58:30,747 --> 01:58:40,896
[SPEAKER_16]: So, we're going to go to a song that I think Jamie likes a lot this week because you had a good accomplishment with this song this week.

1696
01:58:41,717 --> 01:58:43,479
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, we're going to hear the long version of Last Message.

1697
01:58:44,780 --> 01:58:46,842
[SPEAKER_13]: I want the breasts to come... Oh, sorry.

1698
01:58:46,982 --> 01:58:47,062
Pfft.

1699
01:59:35,412 --> 01:59:37,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1700
02:00:06,351 --> 02:00:07,296
Thanks for watching!

1701
02:02:02,143 --> 02:02:10,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm singing all you love No matter where you may be My thoughts will travel to you Cause I need my message

1702
02:02:25,302 --> 02:02:26,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

1703
02:03:01,514 --> 02:03:05,675
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

1704
02:03:05,895 --> 02:03:07,616
[SPEAKER_26]: Do you want to be accepted by Hollywood?

1705
02:03:07,656 --> 02:03:07,996
[SPEAKER_26]: No!

1706
02:03:08,156 --> 02:03:11,797
[SPEAKER_26]: Do we care what people think of us?

1707
02:03:12,397 --> 02:03:14,257
[SPEAKER_26]: No!

1708
02:03:14,277 --> 02:03:15,698
[SPEAKER_26]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

1709
02:03:16,198 --> 02:03:18,438
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes!

1710
02:03:20,259 --> 02:03:22,119
[SPEAKER_23]: Extreme Bomani Radio.

1711
02:03:22,339 --> 02:03:25,060
[SPEAKER_23]: That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

1712
02:03:25,971 --> 02:03:31,555
[SPEAKER_16]: We are back, ladies and gentlemen, and I have tonight's winner of the cage match.

1713
02:03:33,437 --> 02:03:41,202
[SPEAKER_16]: And by an amazing one vote, one vote margin, made this song win.

1714
02:03:41,803 --> 02:03:48,187
[SPEAKER_16]: Tonight's cage match winner is... DuckToy!

1715
02:03:48,207 --> 02:03:48,608
[SPEAKER_16]: DuckToy!

1716
02:03:50,124 --> 02:03:50,804
[SPEAKER_14]: Why?

1717
02:03:50,984 --> 02:03:52,485
[SPEAKER_14]: I tell you not to and you do.

1718
02:03:52,745 --> 02:03:53,485
[SPEAKER_14]: You bastards.

1719
02:03:53,865 --> 02:03:54,205
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

1720
02:03:54,225 --> 02:03:55,746
[SPEAKER_16]: You're on the list.

1721
02:03:56,946 --> 02:03:59,207
[SPEAKER_16]: By one vote over Phantom of the Opera.

1722
02:03:59,587 --> 02:04:00,307
[SPEAKER_17]: One vote.

1723
02:04:00,387 --> 02:04:04,688
[SPEAKER_16]: Doesn't that mean... If the one person who voted for Olive would have voted the other way around.

1724
02:04:06,649 --> 02:04:08,369
[SPEAKER_16]: Only one person voted for Olive.

1725
02:04:08,569 --> 02:04:10,009
[SPEAKER_14]: Do not speak of the English.

1726
02:04:10,089 --> 02:04:11,710
[SPEAKER_14]: I said don't vote for the damn song.

1727
02:04:12,841 --> 02:04:14,262
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I have something better next week.

1728
02:04:14,382 --> 02:04:20,968
[SPEAKER_16]: Which is funny because I could swear that the one person who voted for my song was also the one person who was hating on it in the chat room.

1729
02:04:21,849 --> 02:04:22,530
[SPEAKER_16]: Rob wins.

1730
02:04:25,257 --> 02:04:28,179
[SPEAKER_16]: So, Loki, congratulations, you win once again.

1731
02:04:28,339 --> 02:04:33,283
[SPEAKER_16]: However, I guess since Jamie did this a few weeks back, we will extend the same offer to you.

1732
02:04:34,043 --> 02:04:38,066
[SPEAKER_16]: You can pull the song Voluntary out next week and put in your own new song.

1733
02:04:38,086 --> 02:04:39,928
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we let Jamie do that with the Zelda thing, right?

1734
02:04:40,008 --> 02:04:40,188
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1735
02:04:40,528 --> 02:04:41,709
[SPEAKER_16]: So, only to be fair.

1736
02:04:41,749 --> 02:04:48,294
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, I have, this is my new project thing I want to, I say us as Americans should push this.

1737
02:04:48,954 --> 02:04:52,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Get rid of reality TV and instead put Japanese game shows.

1738
02:04:52,517 --> 02:04:53,057
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah!

1739
02:04:53,590 --> 02:04:53,910
[SPEAKER_13]: Why?

1740
02:04:54,370 --> 02:04:54,651
[SPEAKER_13]: Why?

1741
02:04:55,071 --> 02:04:57,712
[SPEAKER_13]: The greatest thing has happened yesterday, okay?

1742
02:04:58,172 --> 02:05:00,194
[SPEAKER_13]: TNN has brought this new show.

1743
02:05:00,234 --> 02:05:04,196
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's kind of an old Japanese TV show where they basically torture these people.

1744
02:05:04,796 --> 02:05:07,617
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, and they make them do ridiculous challenges.

1745
02:05:07,697 --> 02:05:10,279
[SPEAKER_13]: And the show's called Most Extreme Elimination Challenge.

1746
02:05:10,859 --> 02:05:12,360
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the greatest show ever and...

1747
02:05:12,901 --> 02:05:18,783
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it's all in Japanese, they have these people dubbing over the voices and making them sound really goofy and stupid.

1748
02:05:19,223 --> 02:05:20,263
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's that much better.

1749
02:05:21,124 --> 02:05:22,684
[SPEAKER_13]: It is the greatest show on Earth.

1750
02:05:24,084 --> 02:05:25,585
[SPEAKER_13]: It would beat out any reality show.

1751
02:05:25,685 --> 02:05:26,205
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck that.

1752
02:05:26,505 --> 02:05:28,126
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the best shit ever, okay?

1753
02:05:29,446 --> 02:05:35,008
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the best fucking... This is what game shows should aspire to be, okay?

1754
02:05:35,448 --> 02:05:41,090
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, Price is Right is good, but nowhere... It does not come anywhere near this damn show.

1755
02:05:41,330 --> 02:05:42,050
[SPEAKER_13]: Best show ever.

1756
02:05:43,372 --> 02:05:49,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of reality shows, did you see any previews lately for that new Spring Break reality movie that's coming out?

1757
02:05:52,170 --> 02:05:53,391
[SPEAKER_14]: I already fucking talked about that!

1758
02:05:53,751 --> 02:05:57,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, that fucking black guy in his fucking Speedo, he can die.

1759
02:05:58,014 --> 02:05:59,335
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, this is a great idea.

1760
02:05:59,576 --> 02:06:05,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's take non-actors, give them no script, and just have them go wild on Spring Break.

1761
02:06:05,380 --> 02:06:06,881
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'll film it and call it a movie.

1762
02:06:07,101 --> 02:06:07,501
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck that.

1763
02:06:07,842 --> 02:06:09,323
[SPEAKER_14]: I can go around yelling at people.

1764
02:06:09,343 --> 02:06:10,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1765
02:06:10,564 --> 02:06:13,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of reality TV, I watched something that Islander had.

1766
02:06:14,375 --> 02:06:15,695
[SPEAKER_06]: The Blind Date DVD.

1767
02:06:16,256 --> 02:06:18,036
[SPEAKER_06]: The Uncensored Blind Date DVD.

1768
02:06:22,178 --> 02:06:24,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this one was great.

1769
02:06:25,619 --> 02:06:35,322
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, besides, though, all the boobs and cock there was all over the place, they showed this one person who, like, by the end of the day, they were, like, already all over each other the whole date.

1770
02:06:35,342 --> 02:06:35,802
[SPEAKER_06]: It was funny.

1771
02:06:35,842 --> 02:06:37,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, they just met the first day.

1772
02:06:37,503 --> 02:06:40,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, she, without her, she unbuttoned her sweater.

1773
02:06:41,965 --> 02:06:43,045
[SPEAKER_06]: It was, it was just, like...

1774
02:06:44,204 --> 02:06:45,604
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, these are your first dates.

1775
02:06:45,624 --> 02:06:46,805
[SPEAKER_06]: What's wrong with you stupid people?

1776
02:06:47,925 --> 02:06:51,386
[SPEAKER_16]: By the way, boys and girls, Orange Lounge, the motion picture, comes out at the end of the year.

1777
02:06:51,406 --> 02:06:52,467
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it doesn't.

1778
02:06:54,407 --> 02:06:56,048
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's all it is, is a moving picture.

1779
02:06:56,068 --> 02:06:57,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it comes out and then it goes back in.

1780
02:06:58,388 --> 02:07:03,550
[SPEAKER_16]: Stupid MTV with their stupid reality shows.

1781
02:07:03,750 --> 02:07:06,531
[SPEAKER_16]: Fraternity Life and Sorority Life are being filmed at the same time.

1782
02:07:07,731 --> 02:07:12,593
[SPEAKER_16]: One falls, obviously, the sorority, and the other one the fraternity, and their rival fraternity, sorority things.

1783
02:07:13,479 --> 02:07:14,020
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1784
02:07:24,997 --> 02:07:26,078
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1785
02:07:45,936 --> 02:07:47,817
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1786
02:08:17,515 --> 02:08:19,577
I asked for a big and tasty with no meat.

1787
02:08:19,997 --> 02:08:21,339
[SPEAKER_05]: I asked for a big and tasty with no meat.

1788
02:08:21,379 --> 02:08:25,462
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a piece of bread, some onions, and a tomato.

1789
02:08:27,885 --> 02:08:28,385
[SPEAKER_16]: Beautiful.

1790
02:08:29,606 --> 02:08:30,047
[SPEAKER_16]: You know why?

1791
02:08:30,427 --> 02:08:32,209
[SPEAKER_16]: You need to go to BK because they have the veggie burger there.

1792
02:08:32,429 --> 02:08:33,129
[SPEAKER_16]: It's pretty decent.

1793
02:08:33,570 --> 02:08:33,990
[SPEAKER_16]: Pretty decent.

1794
02:08:34,671 --> 02:08:35,752
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to do listless.

1795
02:08:35,872 --> 02:08:37,033
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, we do need to do listless.

1796
02:08:37,073 --> 02:08:39,756
[SPEAKER_16]: There was one other thing I was thinking of that I wanted to bring up before.

1797
02:08:39,816 --> 02:08:41,117
[SPEAKER_06]: But you forgot, so let's do listless.

1798
02:08:41,217 --> 02:08:41,577
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1799
02:08:42,038 --> 02:08:43,239
[SPEAKER_16]: But I forgot, so let's do listless.

1800
02:08:44,924 --> 02:08:45,304
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm a scat man!

1801
02:09:11,904 --> 02:09:16,928
[SPEAKER_07]: It is time, once again, for Orange Lounge Radio's Listless!

1802
02:09:19,810 --> 02:09:20,131
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

1803
02:09:23,673 --> 02:09:27,196
[SPEAKER_16]: It's, um... Listless.

1804
02:09:27,556 --> 02:09:27,717
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1805
02:09:28,057 --> 02:09:31,500
[SPEAKER_16]: It's inspired by an old television show that used to be on VH1.

1806
02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:33,961
[SPEAKER_16]: Not stolen from, but inspired by.

1807
02:09:35,783 --> 02:09:36,083
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

1808
02:09:36,343 --> 02:09:37,024
[SPEAKER_16]: Tonight's topic...

1809
02:09:40,367 --> 02:09:42,168
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie is here to explain tonight's topic.

1810
02:09:42,649 --> 02:09:43,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I am?

1811
02:09:43,369 --> 02:09:43,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

1812
02:09:43,670 --> 02:09:43,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1813
02:09:44,791 --> 02:09:46,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight's topic is Chicken McNugget.

1814
02:09:47,993 --> 02:09:48,153
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1815
02:09:49,955 --> 02:09:51,956
[SPEAKER_06]: This, again, is back on the Kingdom Hearts theme.

1816
02:09:53,117 --> 02:09:59,763
[SPEAKER_06]: It is what world is associated with Disney, Miramax, Enix, or Square?

1817
02:09:59,983 --> 02:10:00,343
[SPEAKER_16]: ABC.

1818
02:10:00,844 --> 02:10:01,164
Enix.

1819
02:10:02,525 --> 02:10:02,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Enix.

1820
02:10:04,507 --> 02:10:05,047
[SPEAKER_16]: Squeenix.

1821
02:10:05,908 --> 02:10:06,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Squeenix, yes.

1822
02:10:06,709 --> 02:10:07,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Squeenix.

1823
02:10:08,914 --> 02:10:10,035
[SPEAKER_16]: or for Loki, Squamous.

1824
02:10:12,818 --> 02:10:14,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you like to see in the next Kingdom Hearts game?

1825
02:10:15,280 --> 02:10:18,162
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, so what world would you like to... Oh, I'm sorry.

1826
02:10:20,625 --> 02:10:22,526
[SPEAKER_25]: What world would you like to see in the new Kingdom Hearts game?

1827
02:10:22,566 --> 02:10:22,767
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1828
02:10:36,932 --> 02:10:37,532
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, here we go.

1829
02:10:37,572 --> 02:10:38,052
[SPEAKER_16]: Who's starting?

1830
02:10:38,552 --> 02:10:39,473
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait, who's participating?

1831
02:10:39,513 --> 02:10:40,213
[SPEAKER_16]: Show of hands.

1832
02:10:41,453 --> 02:10:42,273
[SPEAKER_16]: This whole thing?

1833
02:10:42,493 --> 02:10:43,513
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys are at McDonald's, sorry.

1834
02:10:43,554 --> 02:10:44,534
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, Jamie's first.

1835
02:10:44,854 --> 02:10:45,374
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Jamie.

1836
02:10:45,434 --> 02:10:48,935
[SPEAKER_06]: My number three would be Chrono Trigger slash Chrono Cross.

1837
02:10:55,156 --> 02:10:57,657
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, so Jamie says Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross.

1838
02:10:57,677 --> 02:10:58,657
[SPEAKER_16]: Any particular reason?

1839
02:10:59,657 --> 02:11:01,297
[SPEAKER_16]: You want to say any of the reasons why?

1840
02:11:02,058 --> 02:11:03,338
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, I think Michelle would kill me.

1841
02:11:05,615 --> 02:11:08,877
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1842
02:11:35,069 --> 02:11:36,710
[SPEAKER_17]: It would be funny to see Chasing Daisy.

1843
02:11:37,530 --> 02:11:38,810
[SPEAKER_17]: Chasing Daisy?

1844
02:11:42,292 --> 02:11:46,053
[SPEAKER_17]: I know, but if you wanted to mix it, it would be Chasing Amy, but you just call it Chasing Daisy.

1845
02:11:46,313 --> 02:11:49,575
[SPEAKER_16]: Any particular reason why we want this Chasing Amy slash Chasing Daisy thing?

1846
02:11:49,595 --> 02:11:53,556
[SPEAKER_17]: It would be funny to see Mickey, Donald, and Goofy going after a lesbian.

1847
02:11:54,117 --> 02:11:55,517
[SPEAKER_17]: You just want Daisy Duck to be a dyke.

1848
02:11:56,437 --> 02:11:57,458
[SPEAKER_17]: Because she'll want Middy.

1849
02:11:59,372 --> 02:12:00,413
[SPEAKER_16]: Dude, this burger's rare.

1850
02:12:00,653 --> 02:12:01,253
[SPEAKER_16]: What's a Nubian?

1851
02:12:02,013 --> 02:12:02,333
[SPEAKER_14]: Look at this.

1852
02:12:02,654 --> 02:12:03,674
[SPEAKER_16]: The burger is pink.

1853
02:12:03,694 --> 02:12:04,434
[SPEAKER_16]: Shut the fuck up.

1854
02:12:05,035 --> 02:12:05,935
[SPEAKER_16]: The burger's raw.

1855
02:12:06,155 --> 02:12:07,496
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to eat it and get poisoned.

1856
02:12:09,297 --> 02:12:11,397
[SPEAKER_16]: Is Jim... What was your online name again?

1857
02:12:11,437 --> 02:12:11,798
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.

1858
02:12:12,838 --> 02:12:13,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Geist.

1859
02:12:13,258 --> 02:12:14,199
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not my online name.

1860
02:12:14,259 --> 02:12:15,339
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just kind of a handle of mine.

1861
02:12:15,799 --> 02:12:16,040
[SPEAKER_16]: Geist.

1862
02:12:16,160 --> 02:12:18,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Geist.

1863
02:12:18,741 --> 02:12:19,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of serious.

1864
02:12:20,782 --> 02:12:23,563
[SPEAKER_09]: In the style of Final Fighting Fantasy, actually.

1865
02:12:26,267 --> 02:12:27,008
[SPEAKER_16]: Any Final Fantasy?

1866
02:12:27,108 --> 02:12:29,529
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Final Fighting Fantasy, Final Flash.

1867
02:12:29,769 --> 02:12:30,249
[SPEAKER_16]: Ah, okay.

1868
02:12:30,429 --> 02:12:30,629
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1869
02:12:34,771 --> 02:12:35,992
[SPEAKER_16]: Final Fighting Fantasy.

1870
02:12:37,173 --> 02:12:46,357
[SPEAKER_09]: For those of you who don't know what Final Fighting Fantasy is, it's basically just a combination of all the Final Fantasy worlds with basically all the storylines intact, like...

1871
02:12:47,097 --> 02:12:52,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever characters died in the games are still dead and various other things like that.

1872
02:12:52,479 --> 02:12:58,342
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, they already have 7 and 8 and 10 involved in Kingdom Hearts already.

1873
02:12:59,162 --> 02:13:00,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you can combine the others.

1874
02:13:02,683 --> 02:13:05,524
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but we're actually picking established individual worlds.

1875
02:13:06,145 --> 02:13:10,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, basically involving 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 as well.

1876
02:13:12,087 --> 02:13:13,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's the thing with this thing.

1877
02:13:13,588 --> 02:13:16,749
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a saga created to combine all those worlds into one.

1878
02:13:19,557 --> 02:13:19,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Huh?

1879
02:13:20,978 --> 02:13:24,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's based off of square characters, though.

1880
02:13:25,760 --> 02:13:26,040
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

1881
02:13:27,921 --> 02:13:29,262
[SPEAKER_16]: Final Fighting Fantasy.

1882
02:13:30,102 --> 02:13:30,362
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

1883
02:13:33,164 --> 02:13:35,465
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, for those who may not have heard of it, there's your explanation.

1884
02:13:35,925 --> 02:13:36,425
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's go on.

1885
02:13:36,665 --> 02:13:38,046
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki, your number three pick.

1886
02:13:39,286 --> 02:13:57,633
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm gonna rain on someone's parade here, but Xenogears or Xenosaga Xenogears or Xenosaga, you gotta pick one Xenogears is fucking, well Xenogears is only, same fucking universe Alright, alright Any other particular reason why?

1887
02:14:00,359 --> 02:14:01,879
[SPEAKER_13]: Because that game rocks.

1888
02:14:01,959 --> 02:14:05,640
[SPEAKER_13]: It has giant robots to smash down Mickey because he sucks and he's gay.

1889
02:14:06,781 --> 02:14:07,421
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, Irene.

1890
02:14:07,861 --> 02:14:08,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Your pick.

1891
02:14:08,941 --> 02:14:12,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm incorporating both Anita and Jason's picks.

1892
02:14:12,882 --> 02:14:15,043
[SPEAKER_05]: So our number three is Star Ocean.

1893
02:14:15,403 --> 02:14:16,343
[SPEAKER_16]: Star Ocean.

1894
02:14:16,483 --> 02:14:16,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1895
02:14:16,843 --> 02:14:18,764
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never played it, but they said it, so I don't know.

1896
02:14:23,528 --> 02:14:23,929
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1897
02:14:25,010 --> 02:14:31,015
[SPEAKER_16]: Since we can pick anything, you know, Miramax, any of that, because they all are owned by the same group, my number three was Pulp Fiction Land.

1898
02:14:31,035 --> 02:14:31,475
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1899
02:14:33,297 --> 02:14:35,979
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be funny.

1900
02:14:36,680 --> 02:14:37,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the Keyblade.

1901
02:14:37,781 --> 02:14:38,742
[SPEAKER_06]: I had it up my ass.

1902
02:14:41,584 --> 02:14:42,545
[SPEAKER_16]: Give me back my Keyblade.

1903
02:14:42,605 --> 02:14:43,266
[SPEAKER_16]: Which Keyblade is it?

1904
02:14:43,306 --> 02:14:44,627
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the one that says Bam-a-da-fuck-a on it.

1905
02:14:46,969 --> 02:14:50,172
[SPEAKER_16]: Lord will strike down upon thee with great vengeance.

1906
02:14:50,232 --> 02:14:50,472
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1907
02:14:51,092 --> 02:14:52,272
[SPEAKER_19]: They'll call the Keyblade here.

1908
02:14:52,292 --> 02:14:52,952
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what they call it?

1909
02:14:55,393 --> 02:14:55,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1910
02:14:55,713 --> 02:14:56,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Lead Blade Royale.

[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

02:15:03,135 --> 02:15:04,075
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie, your number two pick?

1916
02:15:04,755 --> 02:15:07,195
[SPEAKER_06]: My number two pick is Bustin' Move and Bustin' 2.

1917
02:15:08,976 --> 02:15:10,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I want heat in my party.

1918
02:15:12,476 --> 02:15:13,137
[SPEAKER_06]: To dance.

1919
02:15:13,997 --> 02:15:14,917
[SPEAKER_06]: And set people on fire.

1920
02:15:15,882 --> 02:15:30,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so you want Busta Moves so you can have heat lay down the law And no I'm not talking about Puzzle Bobble And the name Busta Groove is not really a name It's what the 989 Studios has duped you into thinking it is

1921
02:15:31,658 --> 02:15:31,958
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1922
02:15:34,140 --> 02:15:35,261
[SPEAKER_16]: Zero, your number two pick.

1923
02:15:35,721 --> 02:15:43,886
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it would be cool to see the Final Fantasy... I mean, all the characters from Kingdom Hearts, like, have, like, an air guys type fighting game.

1924
02:15:44,207 --> 02:15:45,408
[SPEAKER_16]: Ooh, so air guys.

1925
02:15:49,771 --> 02:15:51,792
[SPEAKER_16]: I have no idea if I spelled that right, but I think I'm close.

1926
02:15:54,314 --> 02:15:54,794
[SPEAKER_16]: Close enough.

1927
02:15:57,096 --> 02:15:57,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1928
02:15:57,396 --> 02:15:57,476

[SPEAKER_15]: Your number two pick.

1931
02:16:05,096 --> 02:16:09,279
[SPEAKER_09]: My number two pick would have to be the best thing to come out of Disney, Gargoyles.

1932
02:16:09,840 --> 02:16:10,821
[SPEAKER_16]: Gargoyles.

1933
02:16:10,961 --> 02:16:11,522
[SPEAKER_16]: Very good.

02:16:11,562 --> 02:16:11,922
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1935
02:16:16,646 --> 02:16:18,208
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember the old Gargoyles Quest games.

1936
02:16:18,268 --> 02:16:19,949
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, I don't think they had anything.

1937
02:16:19,989 --> 02:16:21,451
[SPEAKER_16]: Did they have anything to do with the series?

1938
02:16:21,671 --> 02:16:22,692
[SPEAKER_16]: No, they weren't related, were they?

1939
02:16:23,567 --> 02:16:25,289
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, Gargoyles, that's a good one, all right.

[SPEAKER_13]: Well, yeah, what you, the artist formerly known as Squaresoft.

1943
02:16:35,157 --> 02:16:39,421
[SPEAKER_16]: Ergotts, or not Ergotts, ah, fuck, ah, no, wrong game, wrong game.

1944
02:16:39,741 --> 02:16:41,062
[SPEAKER_16]: It gives it an E though, Einhander.

1945
02:16:42,624 --> 02:16:43,364
[SPEAKER_16]: What one, what one?

1946
02:16:43,624 --> 02:16:44,305
[SPEAKER_16]: Einhander.

1947
02:16:44,926 --> 02:16:45,466
[SPEAKER_16]: Einhunter?

1948
02:16:45,886 --> 02:16:48,769
[SPEAKER_16]: Einhander, meaning one-hander.

02:16:49,990 --> 02:16:51,131
[SPEAKER_06]: H-A-N-D-E-R.

1950
02:16:52,964 --> 02:16:53,344
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a shitty game.

1951
02:16:53,364 --> 02:16:53,764
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a shooter.

1952
02:16:54,824 --> 02:16:55,825
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, it's an old shooter.

1953
02:16:55,845 --> 02:16:56,985
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll play Einhunder.

1954
02:16:59,286 --> 02:16:59,546
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

1955
02:17:01,006 --> 02:17:01,666
[SPEAKER_16]: Hmm, okay.

1956
02:17:02,467 --> 02:17:04,927
[SPEAKER_16]: Irene, your number two pick from the little group over there?

1957
02:17:05,327 --> 02:17:11,509
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even think this is like related to Square or Disney or Miramax or anything, but...

1958
02:17:14,537 --> 02:17:15,658
[SPEAKER_05]: I put Reading Rainbow.

1959
02:17:15,998 --> 02:17:17,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I love that show so much.

1960
02:17:17,660 --> 02:17:18,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Reading Rainbow.

1961
02:17:18,801 --> 02:17:19,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1962
02:17:19,641 --> 02:17:22,304
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Reading Rainbow World would be so awesome.

1963
02:17:23,765 --> 02:17:26,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, Reading Rainbow is done by LeVar Burton, right?

1964
02:17:26,147 --> 02:17:27,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, with LeVar Burton.

1965
02:17:27,388 --> 02:17:30,631
[SPEAKER_05]: And LeVar Burton is on Star Trek The Next Generation.

1966
02:17:30,651 --> 02:17:34,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Star Trek The Next Generation was sponsored by... Give me help, sir.

1967
02:17:35,095 --> 02:17:35,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm trying to...

1968
02:17:38,978 --> 02:17:40,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Would he join your party at that point?

1969
02:17:40,919 --> 02:17:41,899
[SPEAKER_10]: 2 plus 2 is 4.

1970
02:17:41,939 --> 02:17:42,699
[SPEAKER_10]: 4 times 3 is 12.

1971
02:17:42,739 --> 02:17:44,019
[SPEAKER_10]: There are 12 inches in a ruler.

1972
02:17:44,039 --> 02:17:45,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Queen Elizabeth was a ruler and so on and so forth.

1973
02:17:48,020 --> 02:17:49,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, anyway, so vote for Reading Rainbow.

1974
02:17:55,002 --> 02:17:55,702
[SPEAKER_16]: Reading Rainbow.

1975
02:17:55,742 --> 02:17:56,783
[SPEAKER_16]: I used to have the theme song.

1976
02:17:56,803 --> 02:17:57,723
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't find it anymore.

1977
02:17:57,763 --> 02:17:58,123
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, well.

1978
02:17:59,103 --> 02:18:00,684
[SPEAKER_16]: Butterfly in the sky.

1979
02:18:04,324 --> 02:18:05,085
[SPEAKER_16]: Dark Oh yeah?

1980
02:18:05,565 --> 02:18:05,885
[SPEAKER_16]: F you

1981
02:18:34,358 --> 02:18:35,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, my number one.

1982
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:38,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, your number one, Jamie.

1983
02:18:38,862 --> 02:18:43,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Disney now owns the rights to the dubbed version of Digimon.

1984
02:18:43,926 --> 02:18:44,847
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's my pick.

1985
02:18:45,327 --> 02:18:46,208
[SPEAKER_16]: Digimon.

1986
02:18:46,228 --> 02:18:47,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Pokemon sucks ass.

1987
02:18:47,850 --> 02:18:49,251
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, I just saw Pokemon 4 this week.

1988
02:18:49,731 --> 02:18:50,272
[SPEAKER_16]: It was cool.

1989
02:18:50,612 --> 02:18:50,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Nerd.

1990
02:18:51,453 --> 02:18:52,534
[SPEAKER_16]: And Pokemon 5 is coming out soon.

1991
02:18:52,574 --> 02:18:56,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, first of all, if you watch Digimon in Japanese, it doesn't suck.

1992
02:18:56,917 --> 02:18:58,499
[SPEAKER_06]: I do agree the dubbed is sort of ass.

1993
02:19:04,179 --> 02:19:05,140
[SPEAKER_17]: Zero, your number one pick.

1994
02:19:06,180 --> 02:19:15,546
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I had a tough time choosing between, but since, you know, Disney owns ABC, because, you know, they're trying to be the Microsoft of television now, I had to choose.

1995
02:19:15,626 --> 02:19:17,887
[SPEAKER_17]: It would either be the Drew Carey show or Whose Line Is It Anyway?

1996
02:19:18,067 --> 02:19:19,328
[SPEAKER_17]: Because that would be hella funny.

1997
02:19:19,808 --> 02:19:20,629
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be funny.

1998
02:19:20,649 --> 02:19:22,890
[SPEAKER_17]: You have to, like, improv to make everyone laugh.

1999
02:19:24,931 --> 02:19:25,832
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that your number one pick?

2000
02:19:26,692 --> 02:19:27,893
[SPEAKER_15]: Son of a bitch, you took mine.

2001
02:19:32,131 --> 02:19:37,474
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to say for those who had their picks taken by somebody else, great minds think alike.

2002
02:19:39,154 --> 02:19:39,995
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not getting you in the mic.

2003
02:19:40,015 --> 02:19:40,955
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you make sure it's on over there?

2004
02:19:41,996 --> 02:19:42,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

2005
02:19:42,376 --> 02:19:42,816
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, there we go.

2006
02:19:42,836 --> 02:19:43,296
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, it's back.

2007
02:19:43,336 --> 02:19:43,656
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever.

2008
02:19:43,676 --> 02:19:44,277
[SPEAKER_16]: That was weird.

2009
02:19:45,977 --> 02:19:57,923
[SPEAKER_09]: My number one pick would have to be excluding those underdeveloped characters, unless there are some pedophiles in the audience, would have to be a Final Fantasy nudist colony.

2010
02:20:00,490 --> 02:20:02,592
[SPEAKER_16]: A Final Fantasy nudist colony.

2011
02:20:03,492 --> 02:20:04,493
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something anybody can like.

2012
02:20:07,335 --> 02:20:09,057
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we had to get porn in the show somehow.

2013
02:20:10,818 --> 02:20:11,218
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

2014
02:20:12,739 --> 02:20:13,380
[SPEAKER_19]: Number one.

2015
02:20:14,301 --> 02:20:14,721
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

2016
02:20:15,562 --> 02:20:17,463
[SPEAKER_16]: Number one from Loki.

2017
02:20:18,104 --> 02:20:18,384
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2018
02:20:18,784 --> 02:20:19,585
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait a second.

2019
02:20:19,865 --> 02:20:20,145
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2020
02:20:21,006 --> 02:20:28,952
[SPEAKER_13]: It's gonna be... Um... Horrible theme park ride turned into movieville.

2021
02:20:34,006 --> 02:20:41,792
[SPEAKER_13]: Horrible theme park attraction turned into movieville because Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion, The Country Bears.

2022
02:20:42,132 --> 02:20:44,994
[SPEAKER_06]: That has nothing to do with the subject of the cage match.

2023
02:20:45,555 --> 02:20:46,055
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure it does.

2024
02:20:46,355 --> 02:20:50,198
[SPEAKER_13]: Pirates of the Caribbean is being made of, you know, you gotta pick one.

2025
02:20:50,218 --> 02:20:51,359
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're Pirates of the Caribbean?

2026
02:20:51,999 --> 02:20:54,001
[SPEAKER_13]: Fine, I'll pick a goddamn universe then.

2027
02:20:54,321 --> 02:20:56,743
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, you know, let's see here, um...

2028
02:20:57,369 --> 02:20:58,730
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me pull one out of my ass here.

2029
02:20:59,951 --> 02:21:01,652
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to pick... Country Bears?

2030
02:21:02,613 --> 02:21:02,913
[SPEAKER_13]: No!

2031
02:21:03,534 --> 02:21:06,937
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to go to... I don't know, let's see.

2032
02:21:07,037 --> 02:21:08,338
[SPEAKER_16]: How about Halloweenville?

2033
02:21:08,378 --> 02:21:12,221
[SPEAKER_16]: Because, you know, the Halloween... Halloweenville's in the game, and Kingdom Hearts 1.

2034
02:21:13,142 --> 02:21:14,883
[SPEAKER_14]: Halloween the fucking movieville!

2035
02:21:14,943 --> 02:21:15,924
[SPEAKER_16]: God damn it, you know?

2036
02:21:16,344 --> 02:21:18,166
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, alright, alright.

2037
02:21:18,246 --> 02:21:22,289
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, it is Miramax.

2038
02:21:23,638 --> 02:21:24,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, if you would.

2039
02:21:24,199 --> 02:21:24,819
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'd go there.

2040
02:21:25,540 --> 02:21:25,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2041
02:21:27,141 --> 02:21:32,206
[SPEAKER_10]: This is D-Child, and since I'm not part of this list list, I'm just throwing one out there because I have to get this out.

2042
02:21:32,326 --> 02:21:32,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2043
02:21:33,106 --> 02:21:39,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Kevin Smith was a whore for Miramax, I'd have to say The Quick Stop, along with James Allen Bob.

2044
02:21:39,973 --> 02:21:40,893
[SPEAKER_10]: You must have them.

2045
02:21:42,395 --> 02:21:44,016
Yeah, I was going to say they already have...

2046
02:21:47,685 --> 02:21:48,565
[SPEAKER_30]: All right, the quick stop.

2047
02:21:48,686 --> 02:21:50,046
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Irene, what's your guys' number one?

2048
02:21:50,266 --> 02:21:52,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, this is at Anita's suggestion.

2049
02:21:52,788 --> 02:21:53,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it on?

2050
02:21:53,888 --> 02:21:54,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, okay.

2051
02:21:55,269 --> 02:21:58,890
[SPEAKER_05]: She suggested Spirited Awayville or town or something.

2052
02:22:00,271 --> 02:22:02,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, yes, because I love Spirited Away.

2053
02:22:02,812 --> 02:22:03,373
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a good one.

2054
02:22:03,433 --> 02:22:04,493
[SPEAKER_16]: Spirited Away was a great film.

2055
02:22:04,533 --> 02:22:06,234
[SPEAKER_16]: So, Spirited Awayland or whatever.

2056
02:22:06,934 --> 02:22:09,236
[SPEAKER_16]: My number one was Whose Line Is It Anyway, but it got taken.

2057
02:22:09,536 --> 02:22:09,916
[SPEAKER_16]: Bastard.

2058
02:22:10,948 --> 02:22:11,789
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm going to change.

2059
02:22:11,829 --> 02:22:18,295
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to do a ride as well because the whole discussion about the ride got me thinking and I would love to see a spinning teacups land.

2060
02:22:25,581 --> 02:22:28,444
[SPEAKER_16]: Where you just spin round and round and you're in a giant teacup.

2061
02:22:30,166 --> 02:22:34,309
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, and then everybody vomits all over and it's just a big green pile of shit.

2062
02:22:34,670 --> 02:22:36,972
[SPEAKER_17]: You should do the faulty gondola ride, Phil.

2063
02:22:39,409 --> 02:22:44,572
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, now's the part where we have to say goodbye to something that's on the list.

2064
02:22:45,032 --> 02:22:45,872
[SPEAKER_16]: Here we go, Jamie.

2065
02:22:46,132 --> 02:22:52,015
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of these that I would take off the list because they have absolutely nothing to do with the subject of the list list, however.

2066
02:22:52,356 --> 02:22:55,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, someone said Ergus.

2067
02:22:55,537 --> 02:22:57,118
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's its own universe.

2068
02:22:58,317 --> 02:22:58,817
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, alright.

2069
02:22:59,058 --> 02:23:05,862
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I'm going to take off Final Fighting Fantasy because that's involving multiple universes, so it's trying to combine multiple things in one, so it's cheating.

2070
02:23:06,683 --> 02:23:08,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so Final Fighting Fantasy.

2071
02:23:08,724 --> 02:23:09,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, stop.

2072
02:23:09,164 --> 02:23:12,486
[SPEAKER_06]: If it was Final Fantasy VI or Final Fantasy V, I would have agreed with it.

2073
02:23:12,586 --> 02:23:15,228
[SPEAKER_06]: However, that's sort of cheating to take multiple answers in one.

2074
02:23:16,249 --> 02:23:17,490
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, so on to technicality.

2075
02:23:17,530 --> 02:23:17,910
[SPEAKER_16]: There it goes.

2076
02:23:18,070 --> 02:23:18,830
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, zero.

2077
02:23:19,051 --> 02:23:21,032
[SPEAKER_17]: She's going to end up punching someone over or something.

2078
02:23:21,570 --> 02:23:24,892
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I would take out probably the Final Fantasy Nudist Colony.

2079
02:23:25,012 --> 02:23:28,214
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I don't think it would be... You could, like, look on the internet for that.

2080
02:23:28,595 --> 02:23:29,996
[SPEAKER_17]: You could look on the internet for that!

2081
02:23:30,416 --> 02:23:32,417
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, get on the internet if you want to see some nudity.

2082
02:23:32,437 --> 02:23:34,819
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we know Cloud's in the gay porn, so, uh, yeah.

2083
02:23:35,079 --> 02:23:38,121
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, I don't know if you can see the list all the way back there, Jim, but is there something on here?

2084
02:23:38,161 --> 02:23:38,661
[SPEAKER_16]: It's gotta go.

2085
02:23:38,681 --> 02:23:46,487
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh... That's called We The Losers, isn't it?

2086
02:23:55,017 --> 02:24:00,261
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, since I wasn't that big of a fan of it, I'd have to say Romy and Michelle, though.

2087
02:24:00,281 --> 02:24:01,161
[SPEAKER_16]: Aw, make me cry.

2088
02:24:01,521 --> 02:24:05,344
[SPEAKER_17]: Do-do-do-do, this is the dial tone, do-do-do.

2089
02:24:06,505 --> 02:24:07,006
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki.

2090
02:24:09,748 --> 02:24:12,710
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, we're gonna take off, um...

2091
02:24:14,218 --> 02:24:15,238
[SPEAKER_19]: Chasing Daisy.

2092
02:24:15,618 --> 02:24:16,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Chasing Daisy.

2093
02:24:17,679 --> 02:24:19,439
[SPEAKER_16]: You do have the quick stops a little better.

2094
02:24:19,459 --> 02:24:20,839
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, quick stops a little better.

2095
02:24:21,380 --> 02:24:22,700
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, I agree.

2096
02:24:23,380 --> 02:24:24,300
[SPEAKER_16]: Irene, what's coming down?

2097
02:24:33,002 --> 02:24:36,543
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm going to take off the spinning teacups.

2098
02:24:38,731 --> 02:24:39,332
[SPEAKER_16]: You suck.

2099
02:24:40,812 --> 02:24:42,072
[SPEAKER_16]: All my pics are going.

2100
02:24:42,573 --> 02:24:43,273
[SPEAKER_16]: Makes me sad.

2101
02:24:43,873 --> 02:24:45,613
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, then that leaves me.

2102
02:24:49,674 --> 02:25:00,617
[SPEAKER_16]: As tempting as I am to take off Chrono Trigger, because everybody knows I think it's overrated, but no, I'm going to keep it on there because I'd get killed by so many people if I did take that off.

2103
02:25:01,098 --> 02:25:05,839
[SPEAKER_16]: So... I don't know.

2104
02:25:05,859 --> 02:25:06,299
[SPEAKER_16]: Um...

2105
02:25:07,952 --> 02:25:13,016
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess I have to take off Halloween, Michael Myers, because it's just... They already did the Nightmare Before Christmas land.

2106
02:25:13,716 --> 02:25:25,245
[SPEAKER_16]: Hellraiser versus... Hellraiser I would have let you keep, but... Alright, so now you can vote for one of these lands that should be in the next Kingdom Hearts game.

2107
02:25:25,386 --> 02:25:28,728
[SPEAKER_16]: So here they are, they're in the chatroom, and Jamie's going to read them off for you.

2108
02:25:28,948 --> 02:25:36,094
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, we have Xenogears, Xenosaga, Star Ocean, Pulp Fiction Land...

2109
02:25:37,193 --> 02:25:48,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Bust and Move World, Air Guys, Gargoyles, Einhander, Reading Rainbow, Digimon, Whose Line Is It Anyway, Quick Stop, and Spirited Away.

2110
02:25:49,339 --> 02:25:49,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Vote!

2111
02:25:50,760 --> 02:25:54,821
[SPEAKER_16]: You can send those votes right now over a private message to me, Sky, in the chat room.

2112
02:26:01,207 --> 02:26:04,390
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, while you guys vote, we're going to take a quick break.

2113
02:26:04,970 --> 02:26:08,973
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're going to come back and just talk about... Are you ready to do a game review this week?

2114
02:26:11,335 --> 02:26:13,777
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, then Zero's game review when we come back.

2115
02:26:13,817 --> 02:26:14,358
[SPEAKER_16]: That'll be fun.

2116
02:26:18,541 --> 02:26:23,485
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so we're going to listen to some more 2DX fun stuff music.

2117
02:26:24,886 --> 02:26:27,929
[SPEAKER_16]: And we'll be right back with Zero and Dark Child's game review.

2118
02:26:28,149 --> 02:26:28,549
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay!

2119
02:26:29,010 --> 02:26:29,990
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, we'll be back.

2120
02:26:49,042 --> 02:26:50,980
[SPEAKER_29]: Maybe don't you cry

2121
02:27:15,973 --> 02:27:17,655
[SPEAKER_29]: What is this thing?

2122
02:27:17,715 --> 02:27:19,357
[SPEAKER_29]: What is this thing?

2123
02:27:19,397 --> 02:27:21,219
[SPEAKER_29]: What is this thing inside?

2124
02:27:21,319 --> 02:27:22,781
[SPEAKER_29]: What is this thing?

2125
02:27:22,801 --> 02:27:23,802
[SPEAKER_29]: What is this thing?

2126
02:27:24,402 --> 02:27:26,204
[SPEAKER_29]: I thought that you were mine

2127
02:28:45,776 --> 02:28:46,537
Thanks for watching!

2128
02:29:16,998 --> 02:29:18,338
Thank you for watching!

2129
02:31:55,171 --> 02:32:03,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

2130
02:32:03,756 --> 02:32:09,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

2131
02:32:09,859 --> 02:32:14,041
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, you're just going to take a left at the Shell Station, and then you're going to go about a mile, anyway.

2132
02:32:14,621 --> 02:32:15,102
[SPEAKER_16]: You're listening...

2133
02:32:15,982 --> 02:32:22,903
[SPEAKER_16]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and I bet you all want to know who won the list-less segment.

2134
02:32:23,923 --> 02:32:24,824
[SPEAKER_16]: So, here we go.

2135
02:32:25,604 --> 02:32:36,126
[SPEAKER_16]: The winning lands that we are going to see in Kingdom Hearts 2, if we had our way, would be, in third place, drumroll, Digimon!

2136
02:32:36,526 --> 02:32:38,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Digimon Land, Digimon World.

2137
02:32:38,066 --> 02:32:42,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot to be specific that I was referring to Zero Two, because anything after that kind of sucks.

2138
02:32:42,687 --> 02:32:43,907
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Digimon Zero Two Land.

2139
02:32:44,407 --> 02:32:44,647
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

2140
02:32:46,860 --> 02:32:51,844
[SPEAKER_16]: Number two, drumroll, is Spirited Away.

2141
02:32:52,564 --> 02:32:53,645
[SPEAKER_16]: Good pick, good pick.

2142
02:32:53,665 --> 02:32:54,366
[SPEAKER_16]: I like that one a lot.

2143
02:32:55,346 --> 02:33:08,696
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, and in first place, Breath of Anticipation is Gargoyles is the winner for the land you'd most like to see in Kingdom Hearts 2.

2144
02:33:12,707 --> 02:33:13,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank God.

2145
02:33:14,469 --> 02:33:16,490
[SPEAKER_16]: Which kind of Chippendales are you talking about, Loki?

2146
02:33:16,550 --> 02:33:17,471
[SPEAKER_16]: Rangers, man.

2147
02:33:17,551 --> 02:33:19,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Rescue Rangers.

2148
02:33:19,433 --> 02:33:20,654
[SPEAKER_06]: My runner-up, though, was Duckburg.

2149
02:33:21,374 --> 02:33:22,355
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, from DuckTales?

2150
02:33:22,615 --> 02:33:23,996
[SPEAKER_06]: DuckTales and Darkwing Duck.

2151
02:33:24,757 --> 02:33:27,279
[SPEAKER_14]: What about freaking, um, no, Doug?

2152
02:33:27,739 --> 02:33:28,220
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello?

2153
02:33:28,620 --> 02:33:29,441
[SPEAKER_16]: No one said Doug?

2154
02:33:30,882 --> 02:33:32,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Patty Manning!

2155
02:33:34,098 --> 02:33:35,238
[SPEAKER_16]: Mozzarella has a good point.

2156
02:33:35,458 --> 02:33:38,200
[SPEAKER_16]: Chip and Dale were in Kingdom Hearts 1, just not their little land.

2157
02:33:38,440 --> 02:33:41,142
[SPEAKER_16]: But they were the guys on the ship, right?

2158
02:33:41,182 --> 02:33:42,422
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, they sent out the ship.

2159
02:33:43,183 --> 02:33:45,965
[SPEAKER_17]: You only saw them for like two seconds, and that was their shot.

2160
02:33:46,565 --> 02:33:46,945
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2161
02:33:47,686 --> 02:33:50,987
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to know, if it was the gummy ship, why were there no gummy bears?

2162
02:33:52,028 --> 02:33:53,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, that would have been cool, too.

2163
02:33:54,069 --> 02:33:55,410
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a gummy bear universe.

2164
02:33:56,531 --> 02:34:00,073
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, the gummy... Well, you were on the gummy ship, though, so you kind of had it.

2165
02:34:00,093 --> 02:34:00,273
[SPEAKER_16]: It was.

2166
02:34:02,267 --> 02:34:03,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Crapyship!

2167
02:34:03,468 --> 02:34:05,530
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the... Hi, we're really jealous.

2168
02:34:05,550 --> 02:34:08,512
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Starfox envy, so we're going to pretend to be Starfox, but not.

2169
02:34:09,013 --> 02:34:10,033
[SPEAKER_06]: We suck.

2170
02:34:10,053 --> 02:34:11,335
[SPEAKER_16]: So you want to have the gummy forest.

2171
02:34:11,355 --> 02:34:12,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn you, Squeenix.

2172
02:34:13,016 --> 02:34:18,540
[SPEAKER_17]: You hoped in grade for the, um, to get the damn warp drive so you didn't have to go through shooting every fucking thing.

2173
02:34:18,761 --> 02:34:21,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'm not even there yet, because I loaned you my game.

2174
02:34:22,464 --> 02:34:24,065
[SPEAKER_17]: What, you mean when you travel between worlds?

2175
02:34:24,625 --> 02:34:25,887
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like right before Agrabah.

2176
02:34:27,208 --> 02:34:27,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Oops.

2177
02:34:28,755 --> 02:34:29,375
[SPEAKER_17]: I just beat it.

2178
02:34:29,515 --> 02:34:30,415
[SPEAKER_17]: But you get the warp drive.

2179
02:34:30,435 --> 02:34:31,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me my game back.

2180
02:34:32,336 --> 02:34:33,476
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to beat the Hades Cup.

2181
02:34:34,676 --> 02:34:35,376
Okay, thank you.

2182
02:34:35,976 --> 02:34:36,817
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, moving on.

2183
02:34:37,297 --> 02:34:38,617
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to get to a new segment.

2184
02:34:38,677 --> 02:34:40,057
[SPEAKER_16]: Brand new segment tonight.

2185
02:34:40,117 --> 02:34:40,617
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay.

2186
02:34:41,198 --> 02:34:42,538
[SPEAKER_16]: Brand new segment of Orange Launch Radio.

2187
02:34:42,558 --> 02:34:48,039
[SPEAKER_16]: This is where some of our new regulars get to shine.

2188
02:34:48,499 --> 02:34:49,179
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh my god.

2189
02:34:50,379 --> 02:34:52,060
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the orgasm segment, everybody.

2190
02:34:52,460 --> 02:34:53,600
[SPEAKER_16]: Holy shit.

2191
02:34:54,200 --> 02:34:55,660
[SPEAKER_16]: Big orgasm, everybody.

2192
02:34:56,521 --> 02:34:58,261
[SPEAKER_28]: This is the best thing in the world.

2193
02:34:59,810 --> 02:35:02,234
[SPEAKER_16]: Zero and Dark Child's Video Game Reveal

2194
02:35:13,909 --> 02:35:17,352
[SPEAKER_17]: Holy shit, and this is a good song to choose.

2195
02:35:17,752 --> 02:35:23,777
[SPEAKER_15]: Zero and Dark Child's game review here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2196
02:35:25,759 --> 02:35:28,241
[SPEAKER_17]: I think Hitmania would have just been good by itself.

2197
02:35:28,381 --> 02:35:30,583
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I just busted at not seeing that manga.

2198
02:35:31,443 --> 02:35:33,085
[SPEAKER_10]: And I haven't even seen the picture inside.

2199
02:35:33,976 --> 02:35:38,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Jamie's showing us Battle Royale manga right now.

2200
02:35:39,523 --> 02:35:43,168
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm about to take that book and drop my pants in the bathroom, okay?

2201
02:35:44,150 --> 02:35:46,132
[SPEAKER_28]: Dude, I'm about to drop my pants right now.

2202
02:35:46,332 --> 02:35:46,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I would Abe away.

2203
02:35:50,895 --> 02:35:53,656
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyways, back to video games.

2204
02:35:55,096 --> 02:35:58,778
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I decided to make this one not as extensive as last time.

2205
02:35:58,858 --> 02:36:01,058
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just going to be a couple random games that we play throughout the week.

2206
02:36:02,139 --> 02:36:08,701
[SPEAKER_17]: Number one is starting off with Midnight Club 2, which, if you haven't played it and you have a PS2, go out and rent it, or... Buy it.

2207
02:36:08,981 --> 02:36:09,241
[SPEAKER_10]: Buy it.

2208
02:36:09,321 --> 02:36:09,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't rent it.

2209
02:36:09,962 --> 02:36:10,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Buy it.

2210
02:36:10,885 --> 02:36:11,746
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2211
02:36:38,178 --> 02:36:40,059
[SPEAKER_17]: Really, you gotta, it's definitely worth it.

2212
02:36:40,179 --> 02:36:43,581
[SPEAKER_17]: The only thing I wish they could have done in that game was get licensed cars.

2213
02:36:44,241 --> 02:36:46,762
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like the cars are exactly like realistic.

2214
02:36:47,062 --> 02:36:49,924
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I know, I'm driving a Honda Civic hatchback.

2215
02:36:49,944 --> 02:36:52,065
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, and it's called like a crapper rapper.

2216
02:36:52,105 --> 02:36:53,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, like a monstro.

2217
02:36:53,846 --> 02:36:55,646
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, you start off with an S-Corp.

2218
02:36:56,127 --> 02:36:57,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, an S-Corp, what did they call that?

2219
02:36:58,228 --> 02:36:59,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Something SI is what they called that.

2220
02:36:59,948 --> 02:37:04,671
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, but it was pretty, the game is good, the graphics are fluid, the music is actually really decent.

2221
02:37:05,291 --> 02:37:07,193
[SPEAKER_17]: It has some pretty good tracks running through the background.

2222
02:37:07,353 --> 02:37:10,236
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not familiar with artists, but you probably know more than I do.

2223
02:37:11,057 --> 02:37:13,058
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no one in particular that we really know.

2224
02:37:13,078 --> 02:37:15,341
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like a lot of their own in-house people.

2225
02:37:15,901 --> 02:37:27,332
[SPEAKER_17]: One good thing about this game also is that, which is something they should have done with the first one, is there's a lot of shortcuts you can take to win races faster or hit checkpoints in different orders and stuff like that.

2226
02:37:28,069 --> 02:37:30,011
[SPEAKER_10]: and the game is fucking hard.

2227
02:37:30,371 --> 02:37:37,359
[SPEAKER_10]: You win the first couple races pretty easy and then all of a sudden it jumps up and you have to really race them perfectly.

2228
02:37:37,539 --> 02:37:41,683
[SPEAKER_17]: You want to talk about a hard race, just drive the motorcycle.

2229
02:37:42,344 --> 02:37:43,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh shit, drive the motorcycle anywhere.

2230
02:37:44,186 --> 02:37:49,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Motorcycle, I thought it was cool because you actually had to lean, shift your weight in order to turn a motorcycle.

2231
02:37:49,751 --> 02:37:54,993
[SPEAKER_17]: So definitely this is a game to buy or rent depending on how big of a racing fan you are.

2232
02:37:55,113 --> 02:37:57,593
[SPEAKER_17]: If you're kind of racy, just thinking about it, rent it.

2233
02:37:57,974 --> 02:38:04,415
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you don't have a PS2 and you have an Xbox, which I don't know why the fuck you'd have an Xbox, maybe just throw it kids or something.

2234
02:38:05,936 --> 02:38:07,496
[SPEAKER_17]: Fucking, hey, fuck Halo.

2235
02:38:07,756 --> 02:38:10,177
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I'm gonna go hit everybody on what goddamn game.

2236
02:38:10,197 --> 02:38:11,157
[SPEAKER_17]: Halo sucks ass.

2237
02:38:14,392 --> 02:38:15,454
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Steel Battalion.

2238
02:38:15,754 --> 02:38:16,315
[SPEAKER_17]: Steel Battalion, yeah.

2239
02:38:16,335 --> 02:38:21,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, if you're buying Xbox just for Steel Battalion, that's $500 down the shitter, alright?

2240
02:38:21,921 --> 02:38:25,466
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll tell you what, though, that Steel Battalion controller makes your dick feel twice as big.

2241
02:38:26,207 --> 02:38:27,849
[SPEAKER_17]: Especially when it's sitting right on top of it.

2242
02:38:27,869 --> 02:38:28,109
[SPEAKER_16]: Twice as big?

2243
02:38:28,169 --> 02:38:32,554
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyways, um, but yeah, if you have an Xbox, you can wait.

2244
02:38:32,654 --> 02:38:33,615
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe it's till...

2245
02:38:35,479 --> 02:38:36,640
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my god, that was wrong.

2246
02:38:37,040 --> 02:38:39,482
[SPEAKER_17]: But anyways... Is that a challenge, Rob?

2247
02:38:39,942 --> 02:38:44,125
[SPEAKER_17]: But anyways... There's no dick-measuring challenges here!

2248
02:38:46,126 --> 02:38:46,627
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyways!

2249
02:38:47,087 --> 02:38:51,970
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I'm trying to say for like the last three minutes, if you have an Xbox for god knows what reason... Shoot yourself?

2250
02:38:52,210 --> 02:38:58,895
[SPEAKER_17]: It's gonna be out, I believe, next month for the Xbox with improved graphics and blah blah blah, and wait...

2251
02:38:59,622 --> 02:39:02,384
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course you'd need an Xbox, you wanna play DDR Xbox?

2252
02:39:05,765 --> 02:39:06,066
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

2253
02:39:07,446 --> 02:39:15,851
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, another one that I actually just, I got to play for a short period of time, which is actually really fun, it's at my house, I gotta start playing it more, is Panzer Dragoon Orde for the Xbox.

2254
02:39:16,712 --> 02:39:22,135
[SPEAKER_17]: That game owns me, and that is sad because I fucking hate the Xbox.

2255
02:39:22,775 --> 02:39:26,137
[SPEAKER_17]: But I have to speak unbiased, and that sucks ass.

2256
02:39:27,628 --> 02:39:30,390
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, it's Panda Dragoon Order, it's SEGA.

2257
02:39:31,551 --> 02:39:34,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft has not tainted this game except to host the game.

2258
02:39:35,594 --> 02:39:35,955
[SPEAKER_06]: It is SEGA.

2259
02:39:35,975 --> 02:39:38,356
[SPEAKER_10]: They put their Xbox logo all over the fucking place.

2260
02:39:38,376 --> 02:39:39,778
[SPEAKER_06]: But besides that, it's SEGA.

2261
02:39:40,378 --> 02:39:42,079
[SPEAKER_10]: SEGA is now the whore of Xbox.

2262
02:39:42,840 --> 02:39:45,062
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's actual talks of SEGA merging with Namco.

2263
02:39:45,802 --> 02:39:48,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but Xbox is also talking about buying out SEGA.

2264
02:39:48,364 --> 02:39:52,988
[SPEAKER_17]: Originally, wasn't it supposed to be EA or Namco, and then Namco decided to put up more money...

2265
02:39:55,219 --> 02:40:00,644
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it's definitely a good game, nice and smooth, and it's pretty much everything you remember from before.

2266
02:40:01,585 --> 02:40:02,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Just visually, like, amazing.

2267
02:40:02,946 --> 02:40:03,967
[SPEAKER_17]: Visually enhanced.

2268
02:40:04,127 --> 02:40:07,750
[SPEAKER_17]: You're still doing pretty much the same thing that you did in the very first Panzer Dragoon.

2269
02:40:08,471 --> 02:40:09,012
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a shooter.

2270
02:40:09,492 --> 02:40:10,553
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, but it's very fun.

2271
02:40:10,593 --> 02:40:12,054
[SPEAKER_17]: It's something that you will never get tired of.

2272
02:40:12,575 --> 02:40:14,677
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's so much stuff to unlock.

2273
02:40:14,717 --> 02:40:16,899
[SPEAKER_10]: You can unlock the original Panzer Dragoon.

2274
02:40:17,699 --> 02:40:18,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Dreamcast, you can unlock that.

2275
02:40:19,260 --> 02:40:22,623
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a whole bunch of different dragons you can unlock for you to change to.

2276
02:40:23,043 --> 02:40:24,784
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't you mean, why do you mean Dreamcast?

2277
02:40:24,804 --> 02:40:25,445
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't you mean Saturn?

2278
02:40:26,025 --> 02:40:26,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, Saturn.

2279
02:40:27,026 --> 02:40:27,586
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my god.

2280
02:40:28,407 --> 02:40:29,768
[SPEAKER_17]: But, um, yeah, definitely.

2281
02:40:30,008 --> 02:40:33,430
[SPEAKER_17]: She keeps showing me this fucking book and it's like, yeah.

2282
02:40:34,111 --> 02:40:34,411
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyways.

2283
02:40:35,151 --> 02:40:35,251
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh!

2284
02:40:35,992 --> 02:40:36,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh!

2285
02:40:36,132 --> 02:40:36,973
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, that was good.

2286
02:40:36,993 --> 02:40:40,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take a trip back to TimeSplitters 2.

2287
02:40:45,553 --> 02:40:48,014
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the funniest game.

2288
02:40:48,034 --> 02:40:51,815
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not traveling back hella far, but we're going back a little while.

2289
02:40:52,095 --> 02:40:54,456
[SPEAKER_17]: This game is hilarious.

2290
02:40:55,056 --> 02:41:00,158
[SPEAKER_17]: Except for the fact that you'll probably never ever unlock absolutely everything in this game.

2291
02:41:00,538 --> 02:41:05,101
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been playing it since it came out, and I still don't even have half the characters unlocked.

2292
02:41:05,401 --> 02:41:11,866
[SPEAKER_17]: The cool thing about this game is that, well, the thing that Jim and I were playing last night, is you can have a fire extinguisher and brick fight.

2293
02:41:13,327 --> 02:41:15,208
[SPEAKER_17]: You sit there and throw bricks at each other.

2294
02:41:16,229 --> 02:41:22,693
[SPEAKER_17]: And the coolest thing was, I was a monkey, and Jim was one of the sergeant guys.

2295
02:41:24,435 --> 02:41:26,276
[SPEAKER_17]: The monkey is a foot and a half tall.

2296
02:41:27,142 --> 02:41:29,703
[SPEAKER_17]: And then you got the sergeant guy who's like 6'6".

2297
02:41:30,104 --> 02:41:32,805
[SPEAKER_17]: So this guy's punching over your head and I'm just walking up sucker punching him.

2298
02:41:32,985 --> 02:41:35,326
[SPEAKER_17]: And the monkey has hella power but no stamina.

2299
02:41:37,407 --> 02:41:43,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm having to look down all the time just to hit him, but for some reason he's just so goddamn quick.

2300
02:41:43,951 --> 02:41:49,574
[SPEAKER_09]: All my shots just constantly keep missing and he's constantly getting a good few sucker punches on me.

2301
02:41:50,268 --> 02:41:58,359
[SPEAKER_17]: and he kicked my he kicked the crap out of me and he's a freaking monkey so because I was a monkey the monkey it's all about monkey power anyways goddamn monkey

2302
02:41:59,096 --> 02:42:03,497
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, basically, the game, the graphics are really good.

2303
02:42:03,577 --> 02:42:05,137
[SPEAKER_17]: You gotta love the facial expressions.

2304
02:42:05,177 --> 02:42:07,818
[SPEAKER_17]: You can actually see facial expressions.

2305
02:42:07,978 --> 02:42:11,759
[SPEAKER_17]: The voice acting is probably one of the best that I've seen in a game in a long time.

2306
02:42:12,739 --> 02:42:17,520
[SPEAKER_10]: And I like the fact that the facial expressions and everything was very cartoony like it should be.

2307
02:42:17,600 --> 02:42:19,821
[SPEAKER_10]: They weren't trying to be realistic.

2308
02:42:19,841 --> 02:42:23,482
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not trying to go fucking Half-Life or Counter-Strike, which is fun to play.

2309
02:42:24,622 --> 02:42:27,603
[SPEAKER_17]: And they had the big breasted chicks just like the first one.

2310
02:42:27,903 --> 02:42:29,043
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, the Jungle Queen.

2311
02:42:29,863 --> 02:42:31,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Jungle Queen.

2312
02:42:31,223 --> 02:42:31,903
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, okay.

2313
02:42:33,264 --> 02:42:35,904
[SPEAKER_17]: She has shit cover in the front, but her ass is totally exposed.

2314
02:42:35,964 --> 02:42:38,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's a cheetah thong that doesn't really have a back strap.

2315
02:42:38,965 --> 02:42:41,605
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it's like Velcro to her skin or something.

2316
02:42:42,605 --> 02:42:42,906
[SPEAKER_17]: Paint.

2317
02:42:43,166 --> 02:42:44,206
[SPEAKER_17]: It's paint or something.

2318
02:42:44,606 --> 02:42:46,446
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe it's all natural, who knows.

2319
02:42:46,466 --> 02:42:50,127
[SPEAKER_17]: Basically, if you want a game to eat up time, do TimeSplitters.

2320
02:42:50,387 --> 02:42:50,647
[SPEAKER_17]: You'll...

2321
02:42:52,213 --> 02:42:52,894
[SPEAKER_17]: It's fun.

2322
02:42:53,194 --> 02:42:54,216
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's so much shit to unlock.

2323
02:42:54,536 --> 02:42:58,040
[SPEAKER_17]: And it has a level editor, which is the greatest thing in the world.

2324
02:42:58,141 --> 02:43:00,383
[SPEAKER_17]: If you want to fuck around with your friends, make an insane level.

2325
02:43:01,365 --> 02:43:05,089
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, like I said before, you'll probably never unlock everything.

2326
02:43:05,169 --> 02:43:07,212
[SPEAKER_17]: And also you can unlock minigames, like Snake.

2327
02:43:08,153 --> 02:43:11,257
[SPEAKER_17]: It's called Anaconda, though, and it's actually a lot better.

2328
02:43:13,394 --> 02:43:16,496
[SPEAKER_10]: Johnny just brought up something I should maybe bring up since it's video games.

2329
02:43:16,716 --> 02:43:17,196
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

2330
02:43:17,216 --> 02:43:18,838
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not out yet, but Far Cry.

2331
02:43:19,378 --> 02:43:22,220
[SPEAKER_10]: A demo I recommend everyone watch to see what this game's gonna look like.

2332
02:43:23,541 --> 02:43:25,662
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's on PC, it's not a console game.

2333
02:43:26,303 --> 02:43:27,163
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that just sucks.

2334
02:43:27,183 --> 02:43:30,626
[SPEAKER_10]: But once it comes out, though, I'll make sure I have a review for you guys.

2335
02:43:30,706 --> 02:43:35,549
[SPEAKER_17]: Right now there's not a whole lot going on the PC front that's worth talking about, game-wise.

2336
02:43:35,569 --> 02:43:36,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice City's coming out, that's about it.

2337
02:43:37,030 --> 02:43:37,750
[SPEAKER_17]: Who the hell cares?

2338
02:43:37,790 --> 02:43:40,812
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, seriously, if you haven't fucking played Vice City by now...

2339
02:43:41,993 --> 02:43:43,714
[SPEAKER_17]: What the hell are you even doing on the face of the earth?

2340
02:43:43,734 --> 02:43:45,355
[SPEAKER_17]: I just showed up.

2341
02:43:45,395 --> 02:43:46,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Say hello to Brad.

2342
02:43:46,216 --> 02:43:53,640
[SPEAKER_01]: I just showed up, and the reason why you wouldn't play Vice City on PS2 and you want to play on PC is because it looks like shit on PS2, and it's going to look really good on PC.

2343
02:43:53,660 --> 02:43:53,981
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

2344
02:43:55,001 --> 02:43:55,541
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're on MP3s, too.

2345
02:43:55,561 --> 02:43:56,762
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

2346
02:43:57,863 --> 02:44:00,164
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, well, yeah, basically... And your own cars.

2347
02:44:01,285 --> 02:44:04,927
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know, unless you can think of... Dude, okay, hold on.

2348
02:44:05,067 --> 02:44:06,048
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody play The Getaway.

2349
02:44:07,335 --> 02:44:08,937
[SPEAKER_17]: Play the fucking getaway, okay?

2350
02:44:09,257 --> 02:44:12,400
[SPEAKER_17]: You will hear the word fuck in the opening scene at least 50 fucking times.

2351
02:44:12,460 --> 02:44:14,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Every fucking goddamn fucking sentence.

2352
02:44:14,342 --> 02:44:19,727
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's funny when you hear the random American guy in there, like, you crash his car, he goes, hey, I just painted that.

2353
02:44:20,628 --> 02:44:22,530
[SPEAKER_17]: And fuck, in the middle of fucking... I want your Cheetos.

2354
02:44:22,590 --> 02:44:23,310
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, yeah.

2355
02:44:24,211 --> 02:44:31,700
[SPEAKER_17]: There's, okay, I'm sitting here playing, and Kara's over at my house, and this guy says, I need to get your details!

2356
02:44:31,760 --> 02:44:33,562
[SPEAKER_17]: And someone thought he said, I need my Cheetos.

2357
02:44:33,662 --> 02:44:36,526
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyways, unless you can think of anything else, that's pretty much the end of it for this week.

2358
02:44:36,746 --> 02:44:38,929
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't think of another fucking bloody fucking thing.

2359
02:44:39,149 --> 02:44:42,493
[SPEAKER_17]: Play Counter-Strike Online, um, kill Johnny.

2360
02:44:43,391 --> 02:44:43,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2361
02:44:43,631 --> 02:44:44,772
[SPEAKER_17]: Because he's really good at that.

2362
02:44:45,553 --> 02:44:52,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Kill anyone that says 9, the number 9, 1, and then the number 6 in their name because they suck and they all die.

2363
02:44:52,679 --> 02:44:54,801
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, my first day playing, I was killing people.

2364
02:44:54,841 --> 02:44:56,082
[SPEAKER_10]: And his name's Unstoppable.

2365
02:44:56,183 --> 02:44:58,024
[SPEAKER_10]: If you find 916, Unstoppable.

2366
02:44:58,845 --> 02:45:00,867
[SPEAKER_21]: And now I have my retro review.

2367
02:45:00,947 --> 02:45:04,150
[SPEAKER_21]: If you go after any team 916, you will die.

2368
02:45:04,190 --> 02:45:04,790
[SPEAKER_21]: Trust me.

2369
02:45:04,850 --> 02:45:06,612
[SPEAKER_21]: You after 916, you will die.

2370
02:45:08,248 --> 02:45:11,171
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the end of the game segment, in case Loki wants to say something.

2371
02:45:12,112 --> 02:45:13,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Loki.

2372
02:45:13,653 --> 02:45:21,301
[SPEAKER_13]: Also being released, they mentioned this weeks, weeks, months ago, is going to be One Must Fall Battlegrounds, the 3D fighter.

2373
02:45:21,541 --> 02:45:23,643
[SPEAKER_13]: Ooh, did that come out?

2374
02:45:23,904 --> 02:45:29,129
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, anyways, I couldn't beta test it because the fucking thing wouldn't work on dial-up, yet they just gave it to me anyways.

2375
02:45:29,569 --> 02:45:33,152
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a demo, a really early demo, and I'm not beta testing it anymore, unfortunately.

2376
02:45:33,172 --> 02:45:34,934
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's coming out, so look for it.

2377
02:45:35,214 --> 02:45:35,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Looks really sweet.

2378
02:45:35,854 --> 02:45:37,075
[SPEAKER_13]: They've got really kick-ass arenas.

2379
02:45:37,095 --> 02:45:40,838
[SPEAKER_13]: They reproduce all the robots, like, perfectly and added more, and it's really fun.

2380
02:45:40,859 --> 02:45:41,319
[SPEAKER_13]: They've got, like...

2381
02:45:42,142 --> 02:45:43,883
[SPEAKER_13]: A bunch of different modes you can play.

2382
02:45:44,063 --> 02:45:50,207
[SPEAKER_13]: They have a sports type thing where it's some sort of soccer type thing and then just death matches and crazy shit like that.

2383
02:45:51,368 --> 02:45:55,791
[SPEAKER_17]: The Scatman needs to be the theme for this.

2384
02:45:56,131 --> 02:45:57,552
[SPEAKER_16]: No, it's listless now.

2385
02:45:57,953 --> 02:45:59,994
[SPEAKER_16]: Jamie has something retro to bring to the table.

2386
02:46:00,034 --> 02:46:00,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Retro review.

2387
02:46:01,075 --> 02:46:01,715
[SPEAKER_16]: Retro review.

2388
02:46:02,175 --> 02:46:04,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Space Harrier on the 32X.

2389
02:46:05,658 --> 02:46:06,638
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the arcade version.

2390
02:46:06,858 --> 02:46:07,299
[SPEAKER_06]: End of story.

2391
02:46:10,168 --> 02:46:10,568
[SPEAKER_17]: Beautiful.

2392
02:46:12,229 --> 02:46:13,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the Fantasy Zone.

2393
02:46:13,270 --> 02:46:13,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Get ready.

2394
02:46:15,811 --> 02:46:24,096
[SPEAKER_17]: If you guys actually want us to review new games, be sure to tell me so that I can actually get out there and test them.

2395
02:46:24,116 --> 02:46:28,419
[SPEAKER_17]: Because seriously, I have no idea what you guys want to know about.

2396
02:46:28,519 --> 02:46:33,442
[SPEAKER_17]: So drop me a line either in the chat room or email me or something.

2397
02:46:33,862 --> 02:46:34,863
[SPEAKER_17]: Most people have my information.

2398
02:46:35,283 --> 02:46:35,563
[SPEAKER_17]: That's it.

2399
02:46:37,567 --> 02:46:42,505
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright Hopefully, I don't know when they're shipping out the ship for DDR Max 2

2400
02:46:43,410 --> 02:46:46,873
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe not next week, but hopefully the week after we'll have a review on DDR Max 2.

2401
02:46:47,013 --> 02:46:49,054
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, because it's coming out this week, right?

2402
02:46:49,254 --> 02:46:55,439
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I've got mine already pre-ordered and everything, but I don't know if they ship them to arrive at your house today.

2403
02:46:55,699 --> 02:46:59,002
[SPEAKER_16]: I think they ship it on that date, so in which case I'll get it the week after.

2404
02:46:59,042 --> 02:47:04,606
[SPEAKER_16]: If we're able to get our hands on it this week, look for Orange Lounge Radio to go live the night we get it.

2405
02:47:04,686 --> 02:47:09,550
[SPEAKER_16]: Bring it over and we'll go live with it the night we get it and we'll play the new stuff for you right off the bat.

2406
02:47:09,590 --> 02:47:11,211
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll unlock stuff on air and play them.

2407
02:47:11,391 --> 02:47:15,133
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I'll do the controller trick, man, and fucking unlock the whole fucking game.

2408
02:47:15,433 --> 02:47:15,753
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

2409
02:47:15,993 --> 02:47:16,593
[SPEAKER_19]: In one night.

2410
02:47:24,917 --> 02:47:37,883
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, while they drool over Battle Royale manga, we're gonna do... We've only got ten minutes left in the show, but we're gonna do a favorite segment of ours called Ask Orange Lounge.

2411
02:47:41,758 --> 02:47:45,040
[SPEAKER_16]: This is where you can ask us whatever you want.

2412
02:47:45,720 --> 02:47:49,562
[SPEAKER_16]: Send us questions over private message in the chat room.

2413
02:47:49,962 --> 02:47:54,084
[SPEAKER_16]: However, some of your questions in the past have really sucked.

2414
02:47:54,525 --> 02:47:56,225
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, will you give me money?

2415
02:47:57,426 --> 02:47:58,487
[SPEAKER_16]: Will you buy me this?

2416
02:47:58,587 --> 02:47:59,367
[SPEAKER_16]: Will you do this?

2417
02:47:59,687 --> 02:47:59,867
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

2418
02:48:00,167 --> 02:48:02,388
[SPEAKER_16]: Stupid questions are not getting asked anymore on the show.

2419
02:48:02,429 --> 02:48:04,390
[SPEAKER_16]: So please send us something that's worth answering.

2420
02:48:04,470 --> 02:48:04,870
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2421
02:48:05,790 --> 02:48:08,291
[SPEAKER_19]: If you ask a stupid question, you'll be kicked.

2422
02:48:08,312 --> 02:48:08,752
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

2423
02:48:10,023 --> 02:48:10,363
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2424
02:48:11,024 --> 02:48:12,405
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, we welcome your questions.

2425
02:48:12,485 --> 02:48:16,088
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, we do like to say that there's no such question as a stupid question.

2426
02:48:16,349 --> 02:48:19,031
[SPEAKER_16]: But, like, are you going to buy me this as a stupid question?

2427
02:48:19,051 --> 02:48:19,571
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.

2428
02:48:19,932 --> 02:48:20,732
[SPEAKER_16]: On this show, it is.

2429
02:48:20,832 --> 02:48:25,216
[SPEAKER_17]: If you ask the question, am I stupid, we're all going to have a nice big yes for you.

2430
02:48:25,396 --> 02:48:25,697
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

2431
02:48:25,877 --> 02:48:26,437
[SPEAKER_17]: Have a nice day.

2432
02:48:26,617 --> 02:48:27,198
[SPEAKER_17]: That's from me.

2433
02:48:28,539 --> 02:48:29,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

2434
02:48:32,362 --> 02:48:32,643
[SPEAKER_16]: Hmm.

2435
02:48:32,883 --> 02:48:33,243
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2436
02:48:33,263 --> 02:48:36,346
[SPEAKER_16]: 23rd Magus.

2437
02:48:38,450 --> 02:48:38,610
[SPEAKER_16]: He did.

2438
02:48:38,630 --> 02:48:39,711
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a return question.

2439
02:48:39,731 --> 02:48:40,712
[SPEAKER_16]: Why are you even asking us?

2440
02:48:40,732 --> 02:48:42,273
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, you know who gave you the balls.

2441
02:49:03,455 --> 02:49:10,197
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I would say when you're up on the altar, that's going to take like 50 times the balls.

2442
02:49:10,277 --> 02:49:11,697
[SPEAKER_15]: Because Loki gave him the ball.

2443
02:49:12,137 --> 02:49:15,298
[SPEAKER_15]: Not to jump to conclusions here, because these are long ways off in the future.

2444
02:49:15,338 --> 02:49:20,960
[SPEAKER_19]: I have a great idea for a mat that had different conclusions on it, and you would jump to them.

2445
02:49:21,878 --> 02:49:23,299
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I'm kind of jumping to conclusions here.

2446
02:49:23,519 --> 02:49:25,060
[SPEAKER_16]: But the ring, it's just one small step.

2447
02:49:25,080 --> 02:49:28,643
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think there's, it's just, it's more of a case of money than balls.

2448
02:49:28,823 --> 02:49:30,164
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, there's not really balls involved.

2449
02:49:30,404 --> 02:49:31,785
[SPEAKER_16]: You like a girl, you buy her something.

2450
02:49:32,505 --> 02:49:34,006
[SPEAKER_16]: There's really no balls involved in that.

2451
02:49:34,186 --> 02:49:34,787
[SPEAKER_16]: That's just money.

2452
02:49:35,407 --> 02:49:36,308
[SPEAKER_16]: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2453
02:49:36,608 --> 02:49:42,292
[SPEAKER_16]: When we get into the more, the longer term commitment stuff, that's going to be the balls, really ballsy stuff.

2454
02:49:42,332 --> 02:49:43,073
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what I'm trying to say.

2455
02:49:43,213 --> 02:49:45,014
[SPEAKER_16]: Stop patting your ego.

2456
02:49:45,674 --> 02:49:46,915
[SPEAKER_16]: Stop patting your ego.

2457
02:49:48,856 --> 02:49:49,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop.

2458
02:49:49,717 --> 02:49:50,017
[SPEAKER_16]: Right now.

2459
02:49:50,157 --> 02:49:50,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Dark Child has something to add?

2460
02:49:52,347 --> 02:49:55,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone wanted to get balls from someone and I wasn't asked to donate?

2461
02:49:59,532 --> 02:49:59,912
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2462
02:50:00,172 --> 02:50:02,074
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a question, why don't we have a panda mic?

2463
02:50:04,756 --> 02:50:10,980
[SPEAKER_20]: Jonas, if you're listening, I gave you $2 a long time ago at the tournament to get me a ball and you never got it for me.

2464
02:50:12,681 --> 02:50:14,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, fine then, since he brought up someone owing him money.

2465
02:50:15,183 --> 02:50:19,406
[SPEAKER_10]: RoboZ, if you're fucking listening, you still owe me $3 for fucking MGL2.

2466
02:50:20,939 --> 02:50:22,320
[SPEAKER_20]: My money, I want a ball, dammit.

2467
02:50:22,640 --> 02:50:23,841
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, more questions, here we go.

2468
02:50:24,161 --> 02:50:25,742
[SPEAKER_16]: DDR Angel wants to know, Loki!

2469
02:50:26,822 --> 02:50:28,843
[SPEAKER_16]: Which song do you plan on doing a remix to next?

2470
02:50:29,684 --> 02:50:30,964
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

2471
02:50:30,984 --> 02:50:33,186
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, I was looking at a bunch of different things.

2472
02:50:33,206 --> 02:50:36,367
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought of one the other day, but I'm, like, drawing a blank right now.

2473
02:50:36,787 --> 02:50:46,373
[SPEAKER_13]: I... Well, I'm gonna do, um... I don't know, I was looking at ghosts and stuff right now, but I don't know, I've...

2474
02:50:47,481 --> 02:50:48,202
[SPEAKER_13]: I have to look at it.

2475
02:50:48,502 --> 02:50:54,467
[SPEAKER_13]: It's pretty much whatever works with what I'm... If I find an MP3 that sounds good that would work with something else, then that's what I normally do.

2476
02:50:54,748 --> 02:50:56,549
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't really think of it beforehand.

2477
02:50:57,270 --> 02:50:59,072
[SPEAKER_07]: So nothing yet except maybe Ghosts.

2478
02:50:59,272 --> 02:50:59,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

2479
02:50:59,772 --> 02:51:00,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe Ghosts.

2480
02:51:00,433 --> 02:51:00,973
[SPEAKER_13]: I tried it.

2481
02:51:01,474 --> 02:51:02,074
[SPEAKER_13]: It was alright.

2482
02:51:02,375 --> 02:51:07,079
[SPEAKER_13]: There was another one I heard that I thought I could mix with Insertion, but I don't know.

2483
02:51:07,700 --> 02:51:08,941
[SPEAKER_13]: I might... Yeah, we'll see.

2484
02:51:11,909 --> 02:51:28,206
[SPEAKER_16]: I have to wait until I get my vinyl, because my vinyl's coming, and then, yeah, there's going to be, you know, obviously the show's going to be getting a new Thursday night event, well, at some point in Season 3, or it's going to be the live mix show, and the mixed vinyl on air.

2485
02:51:30,301 --> 02:51:31,461
[SPEAKER_16]: That's going to be pretty awesome.

2486
02:51:32,282 --> 02:51:33,902
[SPEAKER_16]: That'll be one to listen for.

2487
02:51:34,002 --> 02:51:35,142
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, we're moving right along.

2488
02:51:35,162 --> 02:51:37,463
[SPEAKER_16]: I've got a lot of questions to get through in only a few more minutes.

2489
02:51:37,903 --> 02:51:39,924
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, here we go.

2490
02:51:40,004 --> 02:51:40,364
[SPEAKER_16]: Zero.

2491
02:51:40,804 --> 02:51:42,684
[SPEAKER_16]: Question for Zero from 23rd Magus.

2492
02:51:42,764 --> 02:51:43,244
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm scared.

2493
02:51:43,404 --> 02:51:47,825
[SPEAKER_16]: Zero, what would you do with two quiet Jap girls, a bucket of Choco Ready Whip, and cake pie?

2494
02:51:51,046 --> 02:51:52,347
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, what wouldn't I do?

2495
02:51:52,787 --> 02:51:53,867
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, fuck you, pal.

2496
02:51:54,587 --> 02:51:56,748
[SPEAKER_17]: No, first of all, they have to be of age.

2497
02:51:57,188 --> 02:51:57,608
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2498
02:51:59,218 --> 02:52:04,560
[SPEAKER_13]: He may say of age, but, you know, I will travel to the state where it is legal.

2499
02:52:04,981 --> 02:52:05,981
[SPEAKER_13]: La, la, la, la, la.

2500
02:52:06,061 --> 02:52:11,063
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, actually, unless it was the UK, because 16 is, you know, they're... Hawaii, 14.

2501
02:52:11,163 --> 02:52:13,564
[SPEAKER_17]: Hawaii, 5-0.

2502
02:52:14,024 --> 02:52:14,685
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, my Lord.

2503
02:52:14,745 --> 02:52:15,385
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that your answer?

2504
02:52:15,405 --> 02:52:16,045
[SPEAKER_16]: What wouldn't you do?

2505
02:52:16,065 --> 02:52:16,866
[SPEAKER_16]: Or do you have a better answer?

2506
02:52:16,886 --> 02:52:20,968
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I would do pretty much everything within reason.

2507
02:52:21,288 --> 02:52:23,008
[SPEAKER_17]: I wouldn't go, like... Within reason?

2508
02:52:23,048 --> 02:52:24,709
[SPEAKER_17]: Pour them out to edibles or something.

2509
02:52:25,690 --> 02:52:27,330
[SPEAKER_16]: And what about cake pie?

2510
02:52:27,550 --> 02:52:28,751
[SPEAKER_16]: You wouldn't make them eat the cake pie?

2511
02:52:34,046 --> 02:52:42,910
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey Loki, about your Hawaii comic, they gotta have grass on the field before you can play ball.

2512
02:52:45,671 --> 02:52:48,152
[SPEAKER_19]: Just because the grass grows doesn't mean it needs to be there.

2513
02:52:49,712 --> 02:52:51,773
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my fucking god.

2514
02:52:54,794 --> 02:52:56,095
[SPEAKER_16]: Moving right along...

2515
02:52:57,896 --> 02:53:00,438
[SPEAKER_16]: Akuma GM has a good question.

2516
02:53:01,318 --> 02:53:04,280
[SPEAKER_16]: Does Beatmania 2DX have a chance in the US?

2517
02:53:05,961 --> 02:53:06,161
[SPEAKER_16]: Why?

2518
02:53:06,241 --> 02:53:07,022
[SPEAKER_16]: Why no, Zero?

2519
02:53:07,502 --> 02:53:07,862
[SPEAKER_16]: Why no?

2520
02:53:09,363 --> 02:53:11,764
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we really want to let them ruin another good game?

2521
02:53:13,025 --> 02:53:15,687
[SPEAKER_14]: If a goat can sing in American Idol, anything's possible.

2522
02:53:18,348 --> 02:53:20,609
[SPEAKER_28]: Let them move!

2523
02:53:20,749 --> 02:53:22,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Let them move!

2524
02:53:24,109 --> 02:53:27,290
[SPEAKER_10]: If DDR-US mix was allowed, anything could happen.

2525
02:53:27,530 --> 02:53:28,930
[SPEAKER_16]: I second that notion.

2526
02:53:28,970 --> 02:53:32,551
[SPEAKER_16]: If DDR-US mix was allowed, 2DX-US mix can't be far behind.

2527
02:53:32,591 --> 02:53:34,052
[SPEAKER_17]: DDR-USA did not happen.

2528
02:53:35,032 --> 02:53:35,332
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

2529
02:53:36,352 --> 02:53:37,632
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm cutting off questions now.

2530
02:53:37,672 --> 02:53:39,913
[SPEAKER_16]: These last five questions I have are it.

2531
02:53:39,993 --> 02:53:40,233
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2532
02:53:40,793 --> 02:53:44,814
[SPEAKER_16]: VidPala, why does cereal cost so much, and what is your favorite cereal?

2533
02:53:47,270 --> 02:53:48,570
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Frosted Mini Wheats.

2534
02:53:49,031 --> 02:53:50,371
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to answer your other question.

2535
02:53:52,932 --> 02:53:57,013
[SPEAKER_17]: If you go to like Bel Air or Safeway, they have like two boxes of cereal for $4.

2536
02:53:57,153 --> 02:53:59,574
[SPEAKER_17]: All the Kellogg's brands.

2537
02:53:59,854 --> 02:54:01,995
[SPEAKER_17]: And besides, I like Apple Jacks.

2538
02:54:02,475 --> 02:54:03,795
[SPEAKER_17]: Just because I just do.

2539
02:54:04,175 --> 02:54:05,616
[SPEAKER_28]: They don't taste like apples!

2540
02:54:05,636 --> 02:54:07,556
[SPEAKER_28]: They don't taste like apples, you stupid!

2541
02:54:07,596 --> 02:54:08,737
[SPEAKER_28]: What's wrong with you?

2542
02:54:09,437 --> 02:54:10,477
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not an answer!

2543
02:54:10,697 --> 02:54:11,798
[SPEAKER_13]: They didn't really have an answer.

2544
02:54:11,818 --> 02:54:12,738
[SPEAKER_06]: I have another favorite.

2545
02:54:12,798 --> 02:54:13,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Crackle Jacks.

2546
02:54:13,738 --> 02:54:14,738
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Cracklin' Oat Bran.

2547
02:54:15,179 --> 02:54:16,239
Cracklin' Goat Brain.

2548
02:54:18,772 --> 02:54:20,494
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't crackle like Snap Crackle Pop.

2549
02:54:20,514 --> 02:54:22,475
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, let's move on, because we've got a bunch of questions to get through.

2550
02:54:22,736 --> 02:54:23,717
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2551
02:54:24,317 --> 02:54:27,040
[SPEAKER_13]: I like Special K and Fruity Pebbles in Captain Crunch.

2552
02:54:27,480 --> 02:54:29,702
[SPEAKER_19]: It depends what kind of mood I'm in.

2553
02:54:29,842 --> 02:54:34,567
[SPEAKER_19]: Healthy, you know, I go with the Special K. Fruity, I go with, you know, Fruity Pebbles.

2554
02:54:34,927 --> 02:54:39,071
[SPEAKER_19]: And just damn, like, cavity, you know, juicy, and I go with Captain Crunch.

2555
02:54:39,171 --> 02:54:40,232
[SPEAKER_13]: And why cereal is so expensive?

2556
02:54:40,252 --> 02:54:41,213
[SPEAKER_13]: It's because of all the damn toys.

2557
02:54:41,573 --> 02:54:42,514
[SPEAKER_13]: And it sponsors terrorism.

2558
02:54:44,628 --> 02:54:48,451
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, actually, I used to name my stepbrother Special K. Okay.

2559
02:54:49,812 --> 02:54:54,616
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, why it costs so much, it's because it's somehow in some form controlled by the government.

2560
02:54:54,656 --> 02:54:55,116
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how.

2561
02:54:55,156 --> 02:54:55,917
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll figure that out later.

2562
02:54:56,317 --> 02:55:03,923
[SPEAKER_10]: But I like to eat what I have for breakfast this morning, but normally I'll just take any kind of cereal and just mix them all together and add sugar and a little bit of milk.

2563
02:55:04,323 --> 02:55:05,484
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, just all the cereals together.

2564
02:55:05,504 --> 02:55:06,245
[SPEAKER_10]: That way you get the best of all.

2565
02:55:06,285 --> 02:55:12,530
[SPEAKER_10]: You get the marshmallows, the Apple Jacks that don't taste like apples, the Kraken goat brain, and...

2566
02:55:13,891 --> 02:55:16,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Darny Darko Rock, Cellar Door, Cellar Door!

2567
02:55:19,932 --> 02:55:21,273
[SPEAKER_05]: What you ate for breakfast this morning?

2568
02:55:21,873 --> 02:55:26,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up!

2569
02:55:31,075 --> 02:55:34,896
[SPEAKER_11]: I had some of these little Japanese candies that have been sitting by the computer for a couple days.

2570
02:55:37,190 --> 02:56:00,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, okay, my favorite cereal, I don't eat a lot of cereal, but when I do eat cereal, my favorite is the Pops, Pops, Pops, Corn Pops, yeah, Corn Pops, those are jamming, okay, and the reason why cereal is so expensive is because it's owned by Disney.

2571
02:56:02,290 --> 02:56:08,815
[SPEAKER_16]: I say if you think it's expensive, just go buy it at Sam's Club or Costco and buy me a big box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, please.

2572
02:56:08,875 --> 02:56:09,275
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2573
02:56:10,376 --> 02:56:10,716
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2574
02:56:11,697 --> 02:56:12,278
[SPEAKER_16]: Quick questions.

2575
02:56:12,298 --> 02:56:12,658
[SPEAKER_16]: Here we go.

2576
02:56:12,758 --> 02:56:16,401
[SPEAKER_16]: Nostylan wants to know, when will Orange Lounge be available for DVD or CD?

2577
02:56:16,841 --> 02:56:20,023
[SPEAKER_16]: Unfortunately, due to the music that we play during the show, we can't really sell it.

2578
02:56:21,464 --> 02:56:23,306
[SPEAKER_16]: As far as the content's concerned...

2579
02:56:24,329 --> 02:56:30,994
[SPEAKER_16]: We're still debating kind of the whole internet distribution thing, especially now that some of our episodes are, get this, a year old, getting there.

2580
02:56:31,694 --> 02:56:35,817
[SPEAKER_16]: We're thinking about letting those get distributed on Loki's site later, so.

2581
02:56:37,038 --> 02:56:39,960
[SPEAKER_16]: But as far as like a CD stuff, there's not really a point.

2582
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:49,366
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe a clip CD or something, but unfortunately the quality of the show, since we, well, the problem is that we're so low because of the modem ban, the quality of the show is really low.

2583
02:56:50,447 --> 02:56:52,588
[SPEAKER_16]: There wouldn't be much point to do an audio CD, it would kind of suck.

2584
02:56:55,396 --> 02:56:56,156
[SPEAKER_16]: Last few questions.

2585
02:56:56,697 --> 02:57:02,660
[SPEAKER_16]: RYC3, this is kind of for Zero and Darkchild, wants to know, Rice wants to know if you will do a game review on Raven Shield.

2586
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:05,021
[SPEAKER_17]: What is that on?

2587
02:57:05,321 --> 02:57:08,823
[SPEAKER_10]: We covered Raven Shield a little bit, or I did, back at the tournament weekend.

2588
02:57:09,163 --> 02:57:10,924
[SPEAKER_17]: We didn't have much talking about it, though.

2589
02:57:11,184 --> 02:57:13,005
[SPEAKER_17]: We can check it out again.

2590
02:57:13,425 --> 02:57:19,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Once they come out with a patch that allows it to be played on my computer, because it detects a bad graphics card, then we'll review it.

2591
02:57:20,778 --> 02:57:21,479
[SPEAKER_14]: I just saw something.

2592
02:57:21,799 --> 02:57:24,581
[SPEAKER_13]: I wonder if we can actually dual record the show.

2593
02:57:24,601 --> 02:57:28,824
[SPEAKER_13]: Like record an archive file and record a high quality file.

2594
02:57:31,105 --> 02:57:32,166
[SPEAKER_13]: What if I had a really good computer?

2595
02:57:34,348 --> 02:57:36,209
[SPEAKER_16]: I've thought about it and there's a way to do it.

2596
02:57:36,409 --> 02:57:37,450
[SPEAKER_16]: And maybe when we move.

2597
02:57:37,710 --> 02:57:38,190
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll see.

2598
02:57:38,270 --> 02:57:40,432
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll try to do one on Raven Shield for you.

2599
02:57:40,832 --> 02:57:44,115
[SPEAKER_17]: Give me a couple weeks to find it and get it set up and I'll have it taken care of.

2600
02:57:44,135 --> 02:57:44,215
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

2601
02:57:48,030 --> 02:57:50,572
[SPEAKER_16]: I love that song since I saw Wendell freestyle it.

2602
02:57:50,812 --> 02:57:51,853
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, the song itself sucks, um...

2603
02:58:17,623 --> 02:58:18,943
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't think of anything violent.

2604
02:58:19,104 --> 02:58:20,264
[SPEAKER_06]: It sucks smegma.

2605
02:58:22,305 --> 02:58:23,205
[SPEAKER_20]: I thought it was time.

2606
02:58:23,905 --> 02:58:26,186
[SPEAKER_20]: But I like all the songs that nobody likes, so there you go.

2607
02:58:26,306 --> 02:58:30,127
[SPEAKER_13]: But you know, to be honest, a lot of the club mix stuff really sucks.

2608
02:58:30,187 --> 02:58:32,228
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, the original Jam Jam Reggae sucks.

2609
02:58:32,648 --> 02:58:33,368
[SPEAKER_13]: Jam Jam Reggae sucks.

2610
02:58:33,428 --> 02:58:34,108
[SPEAKER_13]: Emotion!

2611
02:58:34,309 --> 02:58:35,729
[SPEAKER_13]: Emotion sucks ass.

2612
02:58:36,809 --> 02:58:42,031
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, Emotion sucks ass on there because it sounds like they just recorded someone doing just the key presses of it.

2613
02:58:42,111 --> 02:58:44,612
[SPEAKER_13]: It didn't even record it good or anything.

2614
02:58:46,750 --> 02:58:52,516
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, also, but Be My Paradise is alright, except the steps suck ass and it's really slow.

2615
02:58:53,718 --> 02:59:00,164
[SPEAKER_13]: And the new double steps that they made for it really suck, because they're just trying to throw in a bunch of 16th note running for no apparent reason.

2616
02:59:00,184 --> 02:59:02,187
[SPEAKER_13]: Be My Paradise.

2617
02:59:02,207 --> 02:59:02,947
[SPEAKER_10]: I like cheese.

2618
02:59:05,890 --> 02:59:06,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2619
02:59:06,978 --> 02:59:10,641
[SPEAKER_10]: BMI Paradise rocked because Mr. Wendell did this badass freestyle to it.

2620
02:59:11,061 --> 02:59:13,684
[SPEAKER_10]: Big guy freestyles kick ass.

2621
02:59:15,305 --> 02:59:20,289
[SPEAKER_16]: My appreciation for BMI Paradise went up like tenfold when I saw Wendell humping Mel to it.

2622
02:59:21,930 --> 02:59:23,732
[SPEAKER_16]: That was homoerotic wonderful.

2623
02:59:24,612 --> 02:59:25,673
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate Wendell.

2624
02:59:25,873 --> 02:59:26,714
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't appreciate the song.

2625
02:59:28,479 --> 02:59:28,879
[SPEAKER_16]: We love Wendell.

2626
02:59:28,900 --> 02:59:29,981
[SPEAKER_16]: We need Wendell on this show.

2627
02:59:31,222 --> 02:59:32,964
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2628
02:59:34,446 --> 02:59:44,657
[SPEAKER_16]: One more question from SnubDisanoid wants to know, Loki or anyone that makes edits in the room, I just recently made an Afranova edit, but when I put the steps in the DDR edit max, I was two measures short, too many steps.

2629
02:59:45,277 --> 02:59:49,382
[SPEAKER_16]: I have some extra steps before the normal steps start, so should I just eliminate those?

2630
02:59:49,742 --> 02:59:53,888
[SPEAKER_16]: No, because DDR Edit Max, a lot of the gaps that sit on there are wrong.

2631
02:59:54,589 --> 02:59:56,311
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to fix that at some point.

2632
02:59:56,672 --> 03:00:01,218
[SPEAKER_19]: Because there's a lot of steps that are out of sync, or they'll be in sync on DDR Edit Max.

2633
03:00:01,238 --> 03:00:01,778
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, in sync.

2634
03:00:05,194 --> 03:00:05,995
[SPEAKER_19]: You are loose.

2635
03:00:06,215 --> 03:00:11,420
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyways, um, no, there's a lot of, um, a lot of songs where you can make the steps on there.

2636
03:00:11,440 --> 03:00:20,909
[SPEAKER_13]: I think, what was it, Dynamite Rave or one of those was one of the ones that you make on DDR Edit Max and then it gets all fucked up when you play on the arcade and it's like two bars short or something like that.

2637
03:00:21,589 --> 03:00:33,860
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, just what I recommend doing is if you've got something to make an Afronova edit, or even like if you have a US version that can make an Afronova edit on there, and like, you know, just figure out what the gap value is on there.

2638
03:00:33,900 --> 03:00:37,684
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like one of the, uh, values on there, the MDAT or whatever.

2639
03:00:38,865 --> 03:00:41,547
[SPEAKER_16]: Look for that, and then, um, just copy that.

2640
03:00:41,768 --> 03:00:47,573
[SPEAKER_13]: Or, or, what you can do is go online, find an edit for an Afro-, you know, another edit for Afronova,

2641
03:00:48,164 --> 03:00:56,869
[SPEAKER_13]: and just copy that from theirs and then you'll have your synced up and you can also count how many bars it starts on and just fix it that way.

2642
03:00:56,909 --> 03:00:57,869
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I did.

2643
03:00:57,889 --> 03:01:00,130
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

2644
03:01:00,491 --> 03:01:05,453
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to try to fix all of those so that I can be correct.

2645
03:01:06,454 --> 03:01:07,314
[SPEAKER_13]: That will come later on.

2646
03:01:07,474 --> 03:01:08,395
[SPEAKER_13]: It's on the bottom of my list.

2647
03:01:11,232 --> 03:01:12,093
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, that's it.

2648
03:01:12,453 --> 03:01:14,275
[SPEAKER_16]: All the questions from Ask Orange Lounge have been asked.

2649
03:01:14,355 --> 03:01:15,917
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much for submitting your questions.

2650
03:01:15,957 --> 03:01:16,277
[SPEAKER_16]: We love you.

2651
03:01:16,998 --> 03:01:21,883
[SPEAKER_16]: And now it's show end time and we ask everybody for their final thoughts.

2652
03:01:21,903 --> 03:01:23,985
[SPEAKER_16]: You want to go first, Jimmy, or you want to wait?

2653
03:01:24,245 --> 03:01:24,726
[SPEAKER_16]: You're going to wait.

2654
03:01:24,846 --> 03:01:25,166
[SPEAKER_16]: Zero.

2655
03:01:25,326 --> 03:01:25,847
[SPEAKER_16]: Final thought.

2656
03:01:28,109 --> 03:01:28,630
[SPEAKER_16]: Nice catch.

2657
03:01:30,351 --> 03:01:31,913
[SPEAKER_17]: I fit under a desk.

2658
03:01:37,994 --> 03:01:39,934
[SPEAKER_14]: Just like an intern to be fitting under a desk.

2659
03:01:40,615 --> 03:01:41,835
[SPEAKER_14]: Shut up, dick.

2660
03:01:42,136 --> 03:01:42,956
[SPEAKER_16]: While you're down there.

2661
03:01:44,877 --> 03:01:45,517
[SPEAKER_17]: Fuck your mama.

2662
03:01:45,657 --> 03:01:47,578
[SPEAKER_16]: I have dusting that needs to be done while you're down there.

2663
03:01:48,539 --> 03:01:49,099
[SPEAKER_16]: On my ass.

2664
03:01:49,299 --> 03:01:49,439
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

2665
03:01:50,039 --> 03:01:51,060
[SPEAKER_16]: Jim, final thought.

2666
03:01:53,959 --> 03:01:54,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Final thought?

2667
03:01:54,579 --> 03:01:58,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this is a pretty cool show for listening to it for my first time.

2668
03:01:58,340 --> 03:02:01,101
[SPEAKER_09]: It kind of makes me wish I lived up here to listen to it every single week.

2669
03:02:01,621 --> 03:02:02,021
[SPEAKER_16]: We roll.

2670
03:02:02,061 --> 03:02:02,282
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks.

2671
03:02:02,582 --> 03:02:02,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2672
03:02:03,802 --> 03:02:04,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep rocking.

2673
03:02:05,082 --> 03:02:05,823
[SPEAKER_16]: Welcome to the show.

2674
03:02:06,483 --> 03:02:07,243
[SPEAKER_16]: Listen to the show.

2675
03:02:09,864 --> 03:02:16,606
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, on your first show, you picked the listless thing that ended up winning, so that's not too shabby.

2676
03:02:17,233 --> 03:02:19,934
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how I did it, because my two other picks got knocked out.

2677
03:02:19,954 --> 03:02:23,175
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, you kind of had crappy ones out of that, but, you know, Garlic Girls was good.

2678
03:02:23,195 --> 03:02:24,316
[SPEAKER_15]: It's alright.

2679
03:02:25,096 --> 03:02:25,917
[SPEAKER_15]: It's alright, you're a noob.

2680
03:02:26,277 --> 03:02:31,699
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just kind of having a bad day, I can't, I'm not, what I want to think, come up with, you know, just isn't coming up.

2681
03:02:31,739 --> 03:02:33,760
[SPEAKER_16]: We love noobs on Orange Lounge, noobs love us.

2682
03:02:33,800 --> 03:02:34,060
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

2683
03:02:34,460 --> 03:02:34,660
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright.

2684
03:02:35,401 --> 03:02:36,421
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, Loki?

2685
03:02:38,762 --> 03:02:40,883
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I'm starting to get a headache.

2686
03:02:40,923 --> 03:02:42,964
[SPEAKER_13]: I fucking think my blood pressure's up or something.

2687
03:02:43,684 --> 03:02:46,105
[SPEAKER_19]: I, like, have bad cholesterol or something like that.

2688
03:02:47,066 --> 03:02:47,666
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know what it is.

2689
03:02:47,726 --> 03:02:49,727
[SPEAKER_19]: I get a headache all the time when I come over here.

2690
03:02:49,767 --> 03:02:50,347
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know why.

2691
03:02:53,268 --> 03:02:53,988
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know what it is.

2692
03:02:55,809 --> 03:02:56,389
[SPEAKER_06]: I blame Rob.

2693
03:02:56,929 --> 03:03:02,671
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe you have cat dander on you from your cat, and that's why I have a mild headache.

2694
03:03:03,971 --> 03:03:05,752
[SPEAKER_13]: It's probably shirming that I'm allergic to.

2695
03:03:05,872 --> 03:03:06,692
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, fuck it.

2696
03:03:07,612 --> 03:03:07,993
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2697
03:03:09,353 --> 03:03:09,953
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry to hear that.

2698
03:03:10,133 --> 03:03:10,373
[SPEAKER_16]: Anita?

2699
03:03:11,794 --> 03:03:12,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

2700
03:03:13,214 --> 03:03:15,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Captain Picard is a better captain than Captain Kirk.

2701
03:03:16,894 --> 03:03:17,915
[SPEAKER_05]: because he rocks.

2702
03:03:18,035 --> 03:03:21,457
[SPEAKER_05]: He's smarter and he holds his age better.

2703
03:03:22,897 --> 03:03:23,238
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow.

2704
03:03:25,359 --> 03:03:28,060
[SPEAKER_16]: He gets it on in Nemesis and I really don't want to see that.

2705
03:03:29,001 --> 03:03:29,521
[SPEAKER_05]: I did.

2706
03:03:32,643 --> 03:03:33,523
[SPEAKER_16]: Dark child.

2707
03:03:34,784 --> 03:03:36,745
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, that just made me lose some interest.

2708
03:03:38,746 --> 03:03:39,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Final thoughts.

2709
03:03:45,976 --> 03:03:48,618
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really have a final thought, I guess.

2710
03:03:49,338 --> 03:03:52,020
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just throw out something, for the sake of everyone still seeing.

2711
03:03:53,982 --> 03:03:55,503
[SPEAKER_20]: What the hell did he just say?

2712
03:03:55,903 --> 03:03:57,324
[SPEAKER_20]: Bombay, your final thought?

2713
03:03:57,784 --> 03:04:01,247
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, my final thought, I don't have one, I don't have any thoughts right now.

2714
03:04:02,087 --> 03:04:12,515
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, um, my final thought of the night- My final thought is, you voted, they voted off Legend of Trance after one week, and you fucking kept on Goddamn DuckToy.

2715
03:04:12,755 --> 03:04:13,756
[SPEAKER_16]: What is wrong with you?

2716
03:04:14,656 --> 03:04:15,517
[SPEAKER_16]: What is wrong with America?

2717
03:04:18,430 --> 03:04:19,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't get me started.

2718
03:04:19,951 --> 03:04:26,296
[SPEAKER_16]: My final thought would be... God bless the USA!

2719
03:04:31,759 --> 03:04:32,560
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought?

2720
03:04:33,881 --> 03:04:34,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you, Squeenix.

2721
03:04:37,884 --> 03:04:38,564
[SPEAKER_16]: Very well put.

2722
03:04:39,325 --> 03:04:46,190
[SPEAKER_16]: And the last word of tonight goes to... You had it before, and so didn't need a...

2723
03:04:46,986 --> 03:04:52,830
[SPEAKER_16]: Let's give it to... Let's give it to... Let's give it to... Dark Child, fine.

2724
03:04:52,890 --> 03:04:53,610
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll give it to Dark Child.

2725
03:04:53,811 --> 03:04:54,211
[SPEAKER_23]: Last word.

2726
03:04:56,465 --> 03:05:01,450
[SPEAKER_23]: Excrement Cranium You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2727
03:05:02,011 --> 03:05:05,354
[SPEAKER_23]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

2728
03:05:05,934 --> 03:05:11,119
[SPEAKER_23]: Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

2729
03:05:11,400 --> 03:05:14,322
[SPEAKER_23]: If you'd like to leave us a comment, send us an email at

2730
03:05:18,406 --> 03:05:21,848
[SPEAKER_23]: And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2731
03:05:22,368 --> 03:05:24,909
[SPEAKER_00]: I will send a flood to wipe out all the bad things.

2732
03:05:25,389 --> 03:05:27,811
[SPEAKER_00]: I will save two of everything, but everything else goes.

2733
03:05:28,171 --> 03:05:29,351
[SPEAKER_00]: And there'll be a lot of umbrellas.

2734
03:05:30,152 --> 03:05:33,513
[SPEAKER_00]: You, Noah, stop what you're doing and build me an ark.

2735
03:05:34,254 --> 03:05:35,694
[SPEAKER_00]: And Noah, who is Sean Connery.

2736
03:05:37,795 --> 03:05:39,696
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working on a speedboat at the moment.

2737
03:05:42,197 --> 03:05:43,458
[SPEAKER_00]: Speedboat's much faster.

2738
03:05:43,538 --> 03:05:45,499
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll shoo across the water a lot faster.

2739
03:05:47,372 --> 03:05:48,973
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be great photos for the Bible.

2740
03:05:55,339 --> 03:06:01,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I appreciate your sense of publicity, but I want a dark with a big room for poo.

2741
03:06:01,324 --> 03:06:02,204
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be important.

2742
03:06:05,167 --> 03:06:05,647
[SPEAKER_00]: Speedboat.

2743
03:06:05,667 --> 03:06:06,608
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go for a speedboat.

2744
03:06:06,628 --> 03:06:08,209
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get all the animals with long ears.

2745
03:06:08,229 --> 03:06:09,310
[SPEAKER_00]: They can sit along the side.

2746
03:06:09,330 --> 03:06:13,634
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I like that.

2747
03:06:14,972 --> 03:06:16,033
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you build me an ark.

2748
03:06:16,173 --> 03:06:18,434
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a big motor in an ark if you want compromise.

2749
03:06:20,235 --> 03:06:23,137
[SPEAKER_00]: So he started to build himself an ark, started sawing up timber.

2750
03:06:25,719 --> 03:06:27,260
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not actually how you start sawing, is it?

2751
03:06:27,700 --> 03:06:33,023
[SPEAKER_00]: You start sawing by going... That first bit where you...

2752
03:06:41,194 --> 03:06:46,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're into the middle bit of... Where you feel like your dad.

2753
03:06:51,459 --> 03:06:55,621
[SPEAKER_00]: When your dad used to say, I'm off out to the garage to saw a plank of wood in half.

2754
03:06:58,042 --> 03:07:00,524
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.

2755
03:07:03,265 --> 03:07:04,185
[SPEAKER_00]: No reason for it.

2756
03:07:05,386 --> 03:07:07,927
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's see if Dr. Bronowski's still on television.

2757
03:07:08,027 --> 03:07:09,228
[SPEAKER_00]: The Ascent of Man.

2758
03:07:11,613 --> 03:07:12,974
[SPEAKER_00]: Sundays with my dad, that was.

2759
03:07:14,314 --> 03:07:25,218
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, um... So the middle bit of the song... And then the end goes back into... And after a while, Noah realised he was actually punching a baboon.

2760
03:07:28,459 --> 03:07:29,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Get off me!

2761
03:07:31,540 --> 03:07:34,721
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop petting me!

2762
03:07:35,481 --> 03:07:36,702
[SPEAKER_00]: What have you got against baboons?

2763
03:07:37,662 --> 03:07:40,383
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not punching a baboon, I'm sawing wood for an arc.

2764
03:07:41,437 --> 03:07:45,547
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2765
03:08:26,808 --> 03:08:28,050
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, kids, we're back.

2766
03:08:28,170 --> 03:08:29,932
[SPEAKER_16]: Orange Lounge Radio, the afterbirth.

2767
03:08:35,278 --> 03:08:36,579
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, Dark Child has something to say.

2768
03:08:36,619 --> 03:08:37,320
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Dark Child.

2769
03:08:38,692 --> 03:08:40,836
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, since I wasn't here for fuck you's, I need to say this.

2770
03:08:41,357 --> 03:08:46,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, fuck you to like 17 and 16 year old girls that try and pimp on like me and Zero.

2771
03:08:46,586 --> 03:08:49,010
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, first of all, the freestyle is not that cool.

2772
03:08:49,771 --> 03:08:51,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially when I'm up there doing it.

2773
03:08:51,796 --> 03:08:57,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Second of all, once you find out that we're 22 and 23, that means you're underage.

2774
03:08:57,599 --> 03:08:58,839
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't do nothing about that.

2775
03:08:59,359 --> 03:09:07,163
[SPEAKER_10]: Then, when you call us and find out that we're both taken and have girlfriends, that doesn't mean the next morning you wake my ass up at 10 o'clock in the morning to see what we want to do.

2776
03:09:07,843 --> 03:09:09,003
[SPEAKER_10]: That means we're not available.

2777
03:09:09,043 --> 03:09:10,804
[SPEAKER_10]: That means back the fuck up off of us.

2778
03:09:10,924 --> 03:09:11,945
[SPEAKER_17]: Get off my jock.

2779
03:09:12,145 --> 03:09:12,545
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what?

2780
03:09:12,585 --> 03:09:14,566
[SPEAKER_17]: At least I was smart enough to give him a wrong phone number.

2781
03:09:15,740 --> 03:09:17,201
[SPEAKER_14]: What the fuck, man?

2782
03:09:17,781 --> 03:09:20,043
[SPEAKER_14]: No one fucking pips on me when I'm doing shit.

2783
03:09:20,303 --> 03:09:21,323
[SPEAKER_14]: What the hell is that?

2784
03:09:22,684 --> 03:09:23,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I see.

2785
03:09:23,945 --> 03:09:25,666
[SPEAKER_14]: I just, you know, I'm not good enough for you.

2786
03:09:28,027 --> 03:09:30,188
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not good enough for the underage preteens.

2787
03:09:31,369 --> 03:09:35,051
[SPEAKER_19]: I was good enough for you when I used to work pizza and give you a free... You want her number?

2788
03:09:35,992 --> 03:09:37,112
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I'm just saying.

2789
03:09:37,733 --> 03:09:40,334
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the whole ego building thing, you know?

2790
03:09:40,594 --> 03:09:42,155
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, yeah, she hit on me, yeah.

2791
03:09:42,696 --> 03:09:43,356
[SPEAKER_19]: She's underage, but...

2792
03:09:44,272 --> 03:09:46,133
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, man, if I was a little bit younger.

2793
03:09:47,954 --> 03:09:49,836
[SPEAKER_13]: But, no, it's, what the fuck?

2794
03:09:50,416 --> 03:09:51,096
[SPEAKER_13]: That sucks.

2795
03:09:51,356 --> 03:09:54,919
[SPEAKER_13]: Instead I get all swayed and they're like, eh, whatever.

2796
03:09:54,939 --> 03:09:56,980
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever.

2797
03:09:57,080 --> 03:09:59,021
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, anybody else have something they want to say for afterbirth?

2798
03:10:00,522 --> 03:10:01,783
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking cosplay, go away.

2799
03:10:03,126 --> 03:10:07,567
[SPEAKER_19]: I need to start hanging out with you guys, man, because you get hit on by, like, the chicks and stuff.

2800
03:10:07,827 --> 03:10:10,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are you looking at Jamie?

2801
03:10:10,128 --> 03:10:13,008
[SPEAKER_06]: I got hit on by girls when I was playing Angel Sanctuary.

2802
03:10:14,009 --> 03:10:14,309
[SPEAKER_10]: Sweet.

2803
03:10:14,509 --> 03:10:16,689
[SPEAKER_06]: I had fan girls and fan boys because I wasn't it.

2804
03:10:17,109 --> 03:10:18,350
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to try and embarrass Rob.

2805
03:10:19,250 --> 03:10:21,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Another thought in the afterbirth, Rob looks hot with a collar on.

2806
03:10:21,690 --> 03:10:24,331
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if I was gay or even bi, I'd do him if he had that collar on.

2807
03:10:26,122 --> 03:10:26,963
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, the one picture.

2808
03:10:27,924 --> 03:10:28,525
[SPEAKER_16]: Eh, we'll see.

2809
03:10:29,886 --> 03:10:32,529
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe if I was going out to the Rage tonight, I could get all gothy.

2810
03:10:33,850 --> 03:10:35,192
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'm not, because I'm a dork.

2811
03:10:36,926 --> 03:10:37,887
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

2812
03:10:38,067 --> 03:10:38,847
[SPEAKER_16]: That's it, you guys.

2813
03:10:38,887 --> 03:10:42,409
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio and the Afterbirth and the whole nine yards.

2814
03:10:42,949 --> 03:10:47,872
[SPEAKER_16]: And after the show tonight is a whole lot of old music, Bomani music.

2815
03:10:48,132 --> 03:10:51,594
[SPEAKER_16]: There's lots of, like, five key stuff in here and, like, really old stuff.

2816
03:10:51,614 --> 03:10:52,654
[SPEAKER_16]: So you guys want to stay tuned.

2817
03:10:53,014 --> 03:10:56,236
[SPEAKER_16]: Tons of stuff you're not hearing right now currently in Bomani music and more.

2818
03:10:56,596 --> 03:11:06,340
[SPEAKER_16]: But we do encourage you to listen to the Bobani Music Amore program, which runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station when we're not here, with all your favorite DDR, 2DX, and Dance Mania favorites.

2819
03:11:06,660 --> 03:11:08,201
[SPEAKER_16]: And when you whore up our ratings, we love you.

2820
03:11:08,421 --> 03:11:11,323
[SPEAKER_17]: Have you ever noticed every week you try to say that faster and faster?

2821
03:11:11,643 --> 03:11:13,383
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, because I want to go get Boba.
