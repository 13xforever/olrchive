2010	8472	Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
10472	15534	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.
19171	22092	Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
22412	25614	Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
26174	28895	Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
29415	32316	Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
33097	33517	Just kidding.
33717	35318	Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.
35518	42961	In this episode... Hey, are there any balls down there?
43241	45722	That's the biggest fairy you ever seen, Jingle Fairy.
45802	47983	What's your favorite scary movie?
48954	49534	Showgirls.
50435	51315	Absolute fright.
51835	52435	What's yours?
52675	55136	There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.
55196	56497	Don't torture yourself.
57077	57957	That's my job.
58037	60018	Now's the time when Sprockets made me dogs!
60758	64540	I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too.
64900	65820	I know Kung Fu.
66220	68541	I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
68861	70702	Why did they have to take the word gang?
71562	74763	No one expects us to punish exposition!
75063	76004	Yes, yes, yes!
78908	80709	DarkSakura, Shut up!
80909	81589	Where's my gun?
81729	83669	This is my boomstick!
84130	86650	Sky, Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!
86950	90672	Loki, I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.
90752	93532	What kind of warping being would find that funny?

102010	108295	You're tuned into the Bomani Scene's most egg-citing radio station of all things.
108675	110537	Be... Mommy!
111037	112138	That was bad.
113839	115721	I came up with that joke all by myself.
116201	116622	Hand.
118063	118203	Ow.
119224	120044	Did everyone hear that?
120124	120965	Here, I'll do it louder.
122947	123147	Ow!
123707	124228	Mommy!

656866	658711	Orange Lounge Radio With the Ping Pong Ball
665782	667743	I think that's my favorite sound effect that Jamie ever did.
669344	673545	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 41, April the 20th of 2003.
674626	679908	Happy Easter to all you kids out there listening, and if you aren't down with Easter, then happy Sunday to you.
680248	682950	I totally forgot it was Easter, that's why the arcade was empty.
683150	684010	You didn't do anything today?
684730	684970	No.
685711	689552	I went over to my parents' house and had a little ham, and that was it.
690193	694054	We had ham a week ago, so I just ate food.
694655	695315	Just ate food.
697345	699366	A late happy birthday wish to Jamie.
700346	702347	She was one year older as of yesterday.
702887	703807	Happy birthday wishes to you.
703827	704127	Thank you.
704567	705708	Because your birthday was yesterday.
706868	707268	Thank you.
707728	709048	And how did you celebrate?
709649	710289	I killed people.
711369	711929	Oh, wait.
712289	712809	I'm sorry.
713530	718331	I went to the auction, and I got Legendary Axe for the TurboGrafx.
718851	719351	Cool.
720211	721872	I didn't know they made that for TurboGrafx.
722112	722212	Yep.
723152	727299	And I got, um, uh, what was it?
728580	732106	Some game for the Atari adapter for the ColecoVision.
733484	734325	I don't remember what it was.
734905	735325	Centipede.
735906	736246	Oh, cool.
736266	737006	Turns out I already had it.
739808	743151	This lovely bit of literature that you gave me.
744031	745973	Ah, yes, my present, which are always the best.
745993	747954	Which I'm busy trying to remember.
748975	753198	It sucks because I'm so out of practice on my Hiragana that I'm having problems reading some of these names.
753298	757160	I haven't gotten anything yet because I had to buy my mom something her birthday's tomorrow.
757741	758261	That's fine.
758281	759442	You know, priorities and all.
760804	762867	And you gave me a gift certificate around here.
763287	765570	So I can go buy my Battle Royale novel when it's in stock.
765590	768873	So you can indulge more in that Battle Royale-ness.
770195	772197	That big inside joke that just won't die.
772757	774239	It's beyond an inside joke at this point.
775300	776041	It's a lifestyle for some.
776061	778303	I got a really cool card from Brad and Irene.
778524	780406	It's one of my favorite first...
782400	787163	One of my favorite Farside ones is the Many Expressions of the Irish Setter, which are all the same.
789105	794769	And I got money from Grandma, which I put in the bank to pay bills because I'm currently not working.
796330	798792	And I got lunch from Jessica.
800213	804416	And she bought me a clip-on desk lamp so that I can not go blind when I draw.
804816	805297	Very cool.
806297	809860	And I got... You can maybe double and use it with your Game Boy, too, if you want to.
810498	811719	My Game Boy has an afterburner.
813220	814782	Oh, I've got an afterburner.
814902	816003	I've got lots of ice cream.
816483	818164	Ooh, ice cream's always good.
818345	819426	Did you have cake and ice cream?
819626	820386	No, I didn't have cake.
820647	821667	I had brownie and my ice cream.
821988	823289	Well, that's close enough to cake.
823309	823809	Cake pie!
824910	826832	Cake pie!
826952	827973	I want ice cream.
828593	829314	Julie got me boba.
830322	832182	We can go get, let's get ice cream after tonight's show.
832302	832642	Okay.
832702	833403	I want ice cream too.
833423	834223	Are you going to get me ice cream?
834483	835063	I guess I can.
835243	835403	Woohoo!
835423	836323	Because I'm broke.
836343	837443	See if I didn't spoil you enough.
838063	838584	That's alright.
838804	839984	I need more ice cream.
840124	842064	I'm only looking for cake pie ice cream though.
843064	848065	We should take, we should get some cake batter ice cream and some like pumpkin pie ice cream and mix them together.
848125	848485	Voila!
848565	849286	Cake pie ice cream.
849306	850546	They don't have pumpkin pie ice cream.
851226	852386	They don't have pumpkin pie ice cream?
852406	854987	But you know what my favorite is now is getting the cake batter ice cream.
855007	855067	Huh?
855087	857047	Get pumpkin ice cream.
857850	858610	I'm so fucking hungry!
885595	889037	My favorite now is the cake batter ice cream with brownie and coconut.
891198	894100	I used to get cheesecake with graham cracker and cherries.
894620	897462	This is like Iron Chef where the secret ingredient is cold stone.
898282	903665	By the way, do you want to see a really painful way to die?
904045	905666	Okay, because this will be great radio.
905826	907087	Isn't this a great picture of...
908117	911519	That's... Oh my god, he looks like Nine in that picture.
911559	912639	Or are you talking about the other one?
912740	913300	Oh, hello.
913480	914861	Okay, I'm gonna scan this.
914901	915581	He's sexy.
916161	920104	And send pictures of this to everybody here because this is like the best manga ever.
920564	921684	It shows this guy here.
921905	922825	I forgot which one he is.
922845	926507	It has this picture of him, of Nimura hugging the younger one to comfort him.
926987	929008	And then these bullets going through his face.
930129	930289	Aww.
930429	933551	And like it has the bullet time trail like in, um, what was that game?
934528	935008	on PC.
936069	937049	Dead to Rights.
937509	938210	No, no, no.
938670	940971	Where he'd go into bullet time and he'd dodge all the bullets.
941311	941772	Dead to Rights.
941792	942212	Max Payne.
942392	943032	Max Payne.
943092	943652	Max Payne.
943953	947414	You know what I have to say about that?
947454	947995	He looks like Big Boy.
948015	948855	Death to Frodo.
949175	950055	That's what it looks like.
951116	951996	Death to Frodo.
952777	953677	He does look like Frodo.
955918	960060	And look, when he falls on the ground, his head busts open and there's brains all over the place.
961181	961221	Ew.
962213	967937	and he got shot across his belly and his intestines start coming out so he freaking duct tapes them back in.
968437	969117	Oh, nasty.
969258	970999	Are they ever going to make a Battle Royale video game?
971579	972099	Why don't they?
972419	972900	They should.
973400	974101	Why don't they?
974401	977002	Because we suck.
977222	979104	They won't make a video game because we suck.
979744	982886	Damn right, because the stupid Americans get offended by everything.
983206	984487	Oh my god, it's red!
984687	986148	Which insinuates blood!
986388	987289	Which is bad!
987689	990531	As he's bleeding to death, he wires a bomb.
991724	992564	This is so cool.
994185	996205	I don't know if I'm going to regret buying that for Jamie.
996305	997726	She might come up with too many ideas.
998086	999626	And then he tries to pull up Kiriyama.
999706	1001787	And Kiriyama, by the way, looks like the Uber Bishonen.
1002767	1005127	Instead of looking like the Japanese guy who's not.
1005908	1010369	If you hear of any large explosions in the Sacramento area, I've never met Jamie.
1010709	1011409	Never knew her.
1014037	1014478	Anyways.
1017802	1019985	So, orders of business tonight.
1020526	1025833	As you may or may not know, tonight, ladies and gentlemen, is the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
1027736	1028437	In this studio.
1030936	1034160	Just had to get him going for a minute.
1034240	1043852	Yes, tonight's the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio in this studio, in this lovely little house that I'm in right now in Orange Lounge World headquarters in Citrus Heights, to be specific, California.
1043932	1046636	It's the last one here because we're going to have Battle Royale here tomorrow.
1048908	1051391	We'll invite a bunch of people that I don't like and then I'll kill them.
1052673	1053194	Then I'll die.
1054035	1056698	So, we have the chat room going for a minute.
1056718	1057560	They're all, no!
1058561	1059102	I love lag.
1059843	1062706	Anyway, actually it's... Haha, fooled you!
1064108	1064969	We got a lame alert.
1066591	1070696	Actually, what's going to happen, next week's show, okay, what's happening next Saturday is the big move.
1070736	1073159	And what's happening is I'm moving out of the house I'm in right now.
1074220	1078845	And I got to give a big thank you on the show, even though he's not listening right now to Brian, my current roommate.
1078865	1080107	I don't know if he is listening.
1080167	1080447	I don't know.
1080808	1082149	But he's put up with a lot of crap.
1083925	1084465	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1109329	1110250	I'll have the computer set up.
1110270	1111591	That's like priority number one.
1111651	1112812	I can't live without my computer.
1112832	1114193	You said we might not have the internet in time.
1114213	1114813	That's my problem.
1114833	1116435	You have the computer set up and there might not be an internet.
1116475	1116615	Why?
1116755	1118336	We have to call this week and get it set up.
1118356	1119517	I know, I know, I know.
1119557	1122359	They might not come out until Monday or Tuesday if they're not open on the weekend.
1122780	1123460	I have to dial up.
1123781	1124781	I still have my internet.
1124841	1125862	We'll figure something out.
1126062	1126703	We'll figure something out.
1127223	1130146	But bare minimum, there'll be a tape show next week.
1131006	1132908	There'll be some kind of show, new show this Sunday.
1133268	1133969	And then after that...
1135587	1137168	New show, that'll be interesting.
1137949	1139350	We'll get you a stripper.
1140731	1146255	My birthday's coming up, and this is a big one, because I'm 25 this year.
1146875	1148857	I can't believe I just gave my age over here, God.
1149357	1154501	Now I'm like, I just placed myself in that, I'm an over 20 DDR player.
1154521	1160445	I was very happy because the guy at Coldstone, first of all, Julie made them sing to me.
1161838	1164218	I wanted to die.
1164258	1171020	Secondly, the guy behind the counter, in all seriousness, because I looked to be sure, asked me if I was turning 18.
1171120	1175521	I was like... Did you get carded to an R-rated movie?
1175961	1178221	Hey, that's not funny.
1178801	1180101	That's not funny at all.
1180461	1183082	Stupid freaking dead man at Campus Chico Theater.
1183222	1183862	You suck.
1184582	1187663	At least he didn't ask for my... Hi, can I speak to your mommy?
1187903	1189323	No, you can't fucking talk to my mommy.
1190157	1192678	Why would the Coldstone guy want to talk to your mommy?
1192999	1193359	No.
1194920	1198102	See, I don't mind when I'm looking face-to-face with someone.
1198482	1200323	Hey, little girl, I bet your mommy's pretty hot.
1201343	1201804	What the hell?
1201824	1202944	Why would he want to see your mommy?
1203344	1205085	No, I'm talking to him.
1205125	1205366	I know.
1205486	1205906	I know.
1209868	1212690	But I told him to die, go to hell, and opt me off his mailing list.
1212970	1216352	That'd be like, you know, some guy going, hey, I bet your mom's pretty hot.
1216392	1216992	Well, she's dead.
1217152	1217512	Oh, good.
1217532	1218313	Then she can't say no.
1221579	1222819	Loki's unpolitically correct.
1222859	1223899	Statement of the night, thank you.
1224480	1225880	I screw political correctness.
1226780	1227620	It's an excuse.
1227680	1228480	It's a crutch.
1229180	1231461	Back to the story of the moving in Orange Lounge Radio.
1232241	1235662	So in two weeks, we'll be coming to you from our brand new studio.
1235722	1236542	We'll be freeloading.
1237022	1237822	Our brand new studio.
1237882	1240923	If there's a problem, though, maybe we can... You can pay for my gas.
1242363	1247504	If there happens to be a problem, maybe we can convince Jamie to do Studio Jamie for a night, which would be fine.
1247764	1247984	Why?
1248044	1248984	I'm going to be there, too.
1250003	1256164	I know, but if something happens and our internet's not up by then, we might have to do that show at your house.
1256904	1257544	Oh, broadcast?
1257845	1258845	If something happens, yes.
1260385	1263606	Well, I guess no Xbox Live for Dan that night.
1263746	1264566	Well, we'll figure something out.
1264626	1266506	I'm pretty sure the internet will be up for us by then.
1266546	1268447	Oh, darn, I was going to leave it on PSO.
1269267	1270427	Logged in, sitting there.
1271947	1274768	It's really funny to go on PSO and just stand there and have people talk to you.
1276812	1277492	Have you done that?
1278152	1279473	Do you watch people talk to you?
1279573	1280853	People come up, what level?
1281353	1282593	Dot, dot, dot, dot.
1283754	1285334	Okay, dot, dot, dot.
1285454	1287555	You know what people do on PSO that I find hilarious?
1287915	1291256	Like, I went on PSO one night, and this guy was just running in a circle.
1291556	1293456	He just ran in a circle around the lobby.
1293756	1295216	He just kept running in a circle.
1295797	1297957	And then, like, people would try to talk to him, and he just kept running.
1298237	1298857	Like, he did that.
1298917	1302258	I swear to God, I would sit there for ten minutes and watch this guy just keep running in a circle.
1302878	1305259	And then, finally, some guy started running behind him.
1305279	1305619	Yeah.
1307196	1311817	and pretty soon I got in on it too and then like six of us were all running in a giant circle.
1312098	1315158	It was like a big fucking PSO conga line.
1315218	1317479	It was like the nerdiest thing I'd ever seen in my entire life.
1317499	1324861	Speaking of online games, and this only goes out to the smart people, which are basically all of our listeners are smart because they're listening to us.
1325462	1336505	If you go to SquareEnixUSA.com you can sign up, you can register to beta test Final Fantasy XI for PC or PS2.
1338735	1345092	PS2, that's funny I know, that's a hilarious joke I signed up for the PC one
1346284	1347565	Because you know what?
1348526	1353450	When Final Fantasy XI came out, first of all, my first impression was this is the biggest pile of suck there could be.
1354971	1356993	And then the other thing was, I want to play it.
1357113	1360196	If I get Final Fantasy XI, I have to have a hard drive.
1360256	1364099	Maybe I can convince Dan to work that into the bills, get a hard drive for my PC.
1364279	1366661	Why can't they just, you know what they should do?
1367061	1369764	Square should just say, okay... Squeenix.
1369904	1374668	Squeenix should just say, okay, you know, this game really sucked ass.
1375308	1377709	Maxis, what can we do to make this game better?
1378590	1379530	Put it on PC.
1379890	1384073	No, fucking we need Sims mixed with, you know, Final Fantasy.
1384373	1384853	It's awesome.
1384913	1385713	Sims is addicting.
1385753	1386314	People love it.
1386354	1389255	You know, they love creating shit, making new skins and all that crap.
1389675	1394398	But just, you know, with Final Fantasy, you have a little bit of fighting, a little bit of this, a little bit of that.
1394638	1395398	It sounds good.
1395619	1395939	I don't know.
1396279	1397900	Final Fantasy X was good.
1399120	1399440	Damn it.
1399501	1401001	They're remaking all these Final Fantasy games.
1401041	1403843	Why don't they remake Final Fantasy VI and CG-lock for me?
1405000	1406141	That'd be cool.
1406221	1406681	And Shadow.
1428477	1431038	I don't think she died in the video, no.
1431058	1432739	She gets attacked by, like, butterflies.
1432759	1433799	I might have to see that.
1433819	1436840	She doesn't really get attacked, it's supposed to be her coming out of her cocoon.
1436860	1437480	Symbolic crap.
1459557	1462099	I don't want to know about her.
1462119	1465281	She's going in as a crack whore and coming out crack whore.
1466602	1468963	No, she's going in as a crack whore.
1469343	1470524	That means people pay for her.
1471405	1473106	Coming out as crack slut.
1473686	1474727	No one wants to pay for her.
1474747	1482031	You have to think of how many diseases you would catch.
1484033	1486034	That's where the full body condom comes into play.
1486054	1487695	Okay.
1488263	1504143	So yeah, Orange Lounge Radio, going to be a new studio in the new world headquarters in Folsom, California with a scenic view of Folsom State Prison.
1506704	1507464	Coming to you in two weeks.
1534417	1535938	Yeah, come over, we live right by the damn road.
1538000	1542905	When my brother was little, when I went to Arizona to visit my mom, we went to Vegas.
1543545	1546207	My brother seriously would call it the Hoover Darn.
1547328	1549530	Because damn is a bad word.
1550291	1551532	Oh, oh gee!
1552613	1553594	It's a bad word.
1553934	1558939	We're going to have so much shit wired in that new... I have good news, by the way.
1559159	1559499	Yes?
1559779	1561381	I'm going to say this right now because I brought up my brother.
1562361	1562941	I love him anyway.
1582790	1589474	No, I always thought the Marines were like this elite fighting force, yet you keep hearing more and more and more and more and more of them, you know, being made.
1589694	1592736	I don't know, are they just like... Because they're on the front.
1593576	1594117	They're the front.
1594337	1594937	So they're first.
1595117	1596058	First in, first out.
1600592	1601632	I can't believe you said that.
1603553	1604753	It's a South Park reference.
1604793	1605214	It's loud.
1608615	1611476	What's interesting is that, you know, one goes out and another goes in.
1611536	1614137	Our friend, the other Jamie, we know, is going in.
1615017	1615977	As one goes out, one goes in.
1616938	1620259	Hope they don't make her do too many push-ups, but, you know, does the body good.
1621299	1626501	I stayed away from the military, and I'm glad that, you know, as horrible as it is,
1626881	1629282	to be run over at 13 and have your leg put back on.
1630043	1634545	I'm glad that Dan was run over and had his leg put back on because there's no possible way he could ever serve in the military.
1635846	1639488	You know what's interesting, and this has absolutely nothing to do with our show, but whatever, who cares.
1639508	1640148	Porn.
1640588	1641309	Yeah, porn, no.
1641329	1641689	It's funny.
1642209	1643950	No, this is about my dad, not porn, God.
1644590	1644750	Ew.
1644830	1651314	My dad was not able to go to the Korean, my dad's a little bit older than probably a lot of your daddies, he was going to go to the Korean War.
1652454	1655716	And they sent him home because he has an extra vertebrae.
1657338	1657738	Whoa.
1658819	1659839	I would think he'd be in there.
1659859	1662340	It's like, damn, man, if he gets hurt, take one out.
1662520	1663020	He's normal.
1663601	1665221	It makes me wonder, though, if I got that.
1665321	1666462	Like, I need to have somebody count.
1666522	1668783	I've never had a doctor count, like, see if I have extra vertebrae.
1668803	1669923	You're supposed to have a certain amount.
1669963	1671124	I just thought they were just there.
1671144	1671624	Yeah.
1672404	1673025	Crazy, huh?
1674525	1675005	Yeah.
1675686	1676426	Let's all count.
1678047	1679207	Let me take my shirt off.
1679227	1680948	I recommend that you do this while you're driving.
1681268	1682108	It's just awesome.
1682929	1684850	Rob, keep your shirt on.
1684870	1685710	I've seen you in a corset.
1686553	1687674	So have I, unfortunately.
1688855	1693979	So have I. Thank God it's a radio show, because I'm wearing it right now.
1695060	1698183	I was bored one day, and I was just browsing the internet.
1698203	1699704	I was like, you know, I'll read live journals.
1699724	1702887	I read live journals, saw a link to the site, saw the pictures.
1702907	1704929	But actually, you know what's funny?
1704969	1708572	My friend Sean thinks he knows you.
1708852	1711454	Because he used to do Rocky down at the Birdcage.
1712295	1713036	You think you know him?
1713436	1714317	And he thinks he knows you, too.
1715620	1716380	I never did Rocky.
1716821	1717381	Oh, you never did Rocky.
1717441	1718521	Okay, he doesn't know you then.
1718741	1719882	He knows Jessica, maybe.
1720182	1720482	I don't know.
1722383	1726905	We'll talk off air, because I bet our listeners really don't give a shit.
1726925	1728625	See, me, I did conventions.
1729146	1730166	I'm a cosplayer.
1733007	1734088	Yay!
1734268	1734528	Okay.
1734668	1735048	So?
1735328	1735988	What's the point?
1736028	1736909	What's the point?
1736949	1742951	Because that means I'm going to go around and kill people, because cosplayers eventually go psycho, because one little thing goes wrong, and they go around killing everyone.
1743511	1743832	Not really.
1750160	1750920	I need a machete.
1752101	1752842	You need a machete?
1752882	1752942	Yes.
1753362	1753622	Why?
1754643	1755724	I'm starting customer service.
1756944	1758325	Oh, your job starts tomorrow, huh?
1758405	1760627	No, it starts next Monday.
1761868	1765610	Oh, good, we have another week of fuck-off shows on Orange Lounge Radio that go until 5 in the morning.
1766451	1768612	No, no.
1769213	1777158	See, me staying up until 5 in the morning and then waking up at 7 a.m., going back to sleep,
1778507	1780648	Getting up at 10am, going back to sleep.
1781569	1784790	I can't do this business of staying up until 8 in the morning.
1785030	1786971	I was staying up until 8 in the morning on average.
1787392	1791834	You know what, last night I went to bed and the sun was coming up and I was like, God, I haven't done this in a long time.
1791914	1792234	Bob?
1792554	1792834	Yeah?
1793215	1795556	I went to bed when the sun was already high overhead.
1797017	1798958	So I did something really stupid.
1799798	1804500	I stayed up all day and all night.
1804841	1807422	And I was inspired to write lots of fun stuff too.
1808246	1808526	Really?
1808766	1811607	Yeah, I didn't write a damn thing.
1811627	1813528	Because I'm lazy.
1814108	1820871	Every time I start typing, I'd be like, why did I just type in Russian?
1821612	1826333	That's the most entertaining thing to do is you start typing and you start writing something and you're really, really tired.
1826614	1828814	And then you go back and read it and you're like, what the hell?
1828895	1831656	No, when I'm sleep deprived, I make the funniest typos.
1831736	1832136	It's great.
1832496	1834697	I started keeping a log of my typos.
1837543	1838844	I have a breaking news announcement.
1839844	1842825	ViolentHyperGirl, you may know her from Fremont 2.
1843126	1846027	She was the one, if you've seen pictures from the Fremont 2 tournament, she was whipping me.
1847127	1849408	She is coming to Davis for college.
1850549	1853770	Which means Puppy has someone to play with so he won't get so bored.
1854671	1855951	And somebody to meet us for Boba.
1856392	1857092	But guess what?
1857752	1859773	I am getting another breaking news.
1860173	1861874	There's a TapX in Sacramento now.
1862054	1862374	Where?
1863015	1864635	Pocket Road in a shopping center.
1864675	1865556	Where the hell is Pocket Road?
1865576	1865716	Is that
1866846	1867989	Yeah, it's South Sac somewhere.
1868049	1872278	So Skyline, find the address and give it to us now.
1872318	1873581	We are going now.
1873721	1874964	I just hit my knee.
1875485	1876447	I hit my head.
1878570	1882815	And, um, as Dark Tetsuya said earlier, is this going to be one of those shows?
1882895	1884396	It's always one of those shows.
1885037	1887980	Alright, we can talk about Bomani News, and I'll make it quick.
1888580	1892384	Oh, well, no, let's take a break before we do the news.
1892404	1893325	We've got to tease the news.
1893345	1893966	Tease the news.
1894166	1894987	Tease the news.
1895007	1896669	We're going to talk about...
1898811	1899352	I was teasing.
1899532	1900654	I thought you were going to go in the song.
1900834	1901035	No.
1901415	1902397	We need to be, you know.
1902938	1907446	Oh, as soon as our, like, you know, other people arrive, we can do listless.
1908408	1909690	Because we have a special one.
1911852	1912993	Okay, we can tease this.
1913133	1915935	I'm going to play, I don't know the quality of this mp3, I just got it.
1915975	1916476	It's crap!
1916956	1918777	But you can, yeah, it's mp3.
1918937	1919398	It's crap, though.
1919478	1920979	Okay, it's a crap one, but we'll try it.
1921019	1921860	It's from Guitar Freaks.
1921900	1922720	This is one of the Guitar Freaks.
1923301	1924001	These are pretty good.
1924161	1924602	Okay, good.
1924962	1928585	This is the brand new B4U song from Guitar Freaks 9th and Drum Mania 8th.
1929926	1930987	We'll see if it's any good or not.
1931027	1932688	Chikara, I haven't heard this yet.
1932948	1933368	Is it bad?
1933889	1934249	We'll see.
1934269	1935290	We're going to take a quick break.
1935310	1936271	B4U, what do you expect?
1936731	1939813	Okay, we'll be back after a quick break, and we're going to talk about Bomani News.
1939893	1940454	Oh my god!
1963837	1965098	Thank you for watching!
2039896	2041277	Okay, Jamie has a quick announcement.
2041477	2044420	First person to say die, kill Kai gets kicked.

2128285	2131128	And now something I want to hear, Suffer.
2234683	2236397	and now something the chat room made us think of.
2323314	2328579	Okay, we've been getting a lot of requests for this this week, so I'm going to play this one more time.
2329019	2333163	Loki's mix for Schlagwerk called the DarkSakura will fuck you up mix.
2333664	2334965	And Loki, where can they download this?
2335865	2336385	DarkSakura.com
2364170	2366693	It's definitely worthy of the name DarkSakura will fuck you up.
2367393	2369796	It's the first good mix I've ever received.
2369816	2371457	DarkSakura, what will you fuck up today?
2373359	2374280	What will I fuck up?
2375882	2377143	Aww, Jamie needs a hug.
2377223	2379185	I'll fuck your world up.
2380266	2381548	You're supposed to say the Easter Bunny.
2381848	2383950	I don't want to fuck the Easter Bunny.
2420689	2421589	This is fucked up!
2421629	2422530	Here is justice.
2422550	2423330	Here is punishment.
2423350	2423930	This is fucked up!
2464786	2475617	From Step Squad to Orange Lounge, this PDR sucks!
2475697	2478299	Holler, holler, holler, holler!
2478319	2478940	GGBO!
2490874	2493035	and all those other acronyms I don't understand.
2494195	2495236	Big hello to Step Squad.
2495676	2496636	Any of you folks listening?
2497357	2499138	Yes.
2499578	2504720	A big hello to all of you listening because we love the people that listen to Orange Lounge Radio and that means you.
2506984	2508005	Love you guys.
2508205	2516668	If you would like to join in the fun, the big gangbang orgy in our chat room, I mean, well, it's a Mississippi orgy because nobody in there is wearing shoes right now.
2517068	2517349	Yes.
2518169	2523011	The law is no socks, no shoes, and people of multiple genders, all three or four or five of them.
2523871	2524992	That's a Mississippi orgy.
2525012	2525892	It's a Mississippi orgy.
2526372	2528534	We had a Mississippi orgy at my house the other night.
2528574	2529414	And then we killed each other.
2529434	2532936	With paper plates and magic markers and candles.
2533377	2540361	If you want to join in the big Mississippi orgy that is our chat room, head on over to Calibamani.com, our friends over there.
2540421	2542683	Click on Orange Lounge and then click on chat.
2542783	2544124	And it has all the instructions.
2544164	2547926	There's a Java chat, there's an IRC chat, whatever you need to do to get in the room.
2547966	2550508	When you said chat, I thought you said shat.
2553220	2558083	Live Uncensored Radio Fuck, fuck me, fuck, fuck, fuck Hey, you know what I saw for the first time today?
2558423	2565348	Never s- You go to hell!
2565408	2566468	You go to hell and you die!
2568670	2579176	That was so easy I hate to say it, but you do get to sing for that Bitch Love you too
2580544	2591614	No, what I saw for the first time, it's kind of close actually, for the first time today, I saw G4 TV, because my parents have it, believe it or not.
2591734	2592254	Did it suck?
2593295	2597579	It was interesting, it's, you know, we... Did you have GamePro TV on?
2598260	2603965	No, GamePro TV was not on, I watched a show, I watched something called... Did GamePro TV was the best?
2604265	2604285	I...
2605427	2606207	Oh my god, J.D.
2606407	2606827	Roth!
2608368	2609288	That's sad that I know that.
2609308	2610628	Dude, J.D.
2610708	2611749	Roth is the man.
2611789	2612949	We've already gone over this.
2614349	2616570	That's still laughing.
2617350	2625572	I watched a show called Blister, I think it was, with this guy who thought he was funny, who wasn't.
2626392	2628513	And what was the other show I watched?
2628533	2629293	Something called Cheat.
2629553	2630173	Yeah, it was Cheat.
2630213	2630873	That's what it was called.
2630893	2633214	And it was just them giving a lot of... Cheat is not dead!
2635652	2638195	That's where Homestar Runner is going to sell out to, G4.
2641538	2644280	This is the funny thing, though.
2645522	2649105	They didn't get a... Jamie, is your mic on?
2650547	2651668	Yes.
2651688	2653329	They're asking what you got a zing for.
2653750	2654490	My mic is on.
2655431	2656132	Go back to the thingy.
2656292	2656813	That's weird.
2657994	2659315	They asked what you got a zing for.
2659395	2660156	Nobody heard that?
2663058	2664199	I guess you guys weren't listening.
2665160	2666582	Okay, fuck y'all.
2667323	2667944	Not really.
2668124	2668965	Let's reenact.
2669445	2672729	Hey, Jamie, guess what I saw for the first time today?
2673030	2673510	Pussy!
2673951	2674391	Zing!
2675092	2675713	You got me.
2676033	2676514	You bitch.
2677195	2677515	Alright.
2682847	2683587	Speak up, my ass.
2683607	2685308	We're running through the fucking mixing board.
2685508	2686529	No one has to speak up.
2687069	2689210	You turn your damn speakers up, okay?
2689531	2691712	I don't want to speak up, my ass.
2691812	2692132	Rant.
2693132	2694073	Anyway, oh, doorbell.
2694953	2697155	G4, really quick, because I know we have news we want to get to.
2698115	2698936	It was interesting.
2699076	2699916	Why aren't we on G4?
2700076	2701877	Our show would work on G4.
2702117	2703198	Because we don't suck.
2705059	2706239	I wouldn't say G4 sucks.
2706259	2706860	They're just new.
2706920	2707460	They're in their infancy.
2707480	2708381	We need the next channel, G5.
2711044	2711884	I want G69.
2712085	2716209	Oh, Irene's here.
2716870	2720353	And how dare they name that channel after a really shitty Macintosh computer.
2720634	2721394	That's what I want to know.
2722616	2725379	Is it just you or is Brad with you?
2727721	2728001	Oh, okay.
2728382	2728602	Okay.
2734062	2737348	Promises that we do Bomani news when we come back to this break.
2737388	2740594	So I'll hand it off to Loki because he always has something to say Bomani related.
2742125	2748951	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2768772	2770272	But yeah, that's what's coming.
2770893	2775534	Basically, you get an update every Thursday or Friday, I believe, on their Max2 site.
2775554	2776334	They update it every week.
2776654	2780015	And supposedly, this coming up week will be new codes for DDR Extreme.
2780375	2784417	Supposedly, it'll be the last codes, but who really gives a shit?
2787778	2788698	Fucking roulette.
2789278	2789998	Fucking roulette.
2790098	2791319	I hate your roulette.
2792039	2792979	Well, I'll get into that later.
2793599	2795500	Yes, it's not time for the fuckies of the week.
2795520	2795660	Yes.
2798325	2799085	Jam and Marmalade.
2799165	2799346	What?
2799366	2802227	Paranoia Survivor.
2802247	2802827	I didn't read anything.
2802947	2803188	Oh, yeah.
2803428	2804949	It's rumored to be on there, I think.
2805169	2805509	Or no.
2806069	2807490	Oh, more Paranoia.
2807550	2807970	Yay.
2809211	2809451	Yeah.
2810612	2813333	Paranoia Survivor is rumored to be in Unlock on Max 2.
2814033	2814534	But guess what?
2815654	2816695	Guess what Glacial is?
2818096	2821417	Glacial is... Was a character in Killer Instinct.
2825540	2825880	No.
2825900	2825940	No.
2827876	2832118	It's a cover song.
2832259	2833719	It's a cover song done by B4U.
2833879	2834940	It's an English song.
2834960	2838882	Fuck, I can't remember what song it is.
2839762	2841583	It's a B4U cover of a song.
2841703	2842384	I can't remember.
2842404	2846145	I posted about it like a while ago, but it's just escaped my mind right now.
2846826	2850868	If we go to the Max Suicide, I can tell you because it says on it.
2851028	2852729	That's a future listless topic in waiting.
2852769	2855050	B4U, a song we'd like to see B4U ruin.
2856099	2857860	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2880427	2881047	Taka Remixed by Tak
2901702	2902523	Is it TAC Remix?
2902823	2904224	Well, either way, it's pretty much Outface.
2904264	2904944	It's Outface-y!
2905725	2908446	So, let's hear a little clip, because this is kind of bad quality.
2908466	2910908	We apologize, but it's all we got right now, but you can get a feel for it.
2926904	2928625	You can hear that guitar sound in it.
2929225	2933547	It sounds like a remix of Stoic mixed with Diamond Jealousy.
2933927	2935048	That's Yamaoka.
2935828	2937809	I know, but that's what I'm saying what it sounds like.
2940790	2942211	My tack-dar went off.
2943612	2944092	Tack-dar?
2944810	2947691	I'm now, um, I have to clean up, excuse me.
2948852	2951813	Okay, while she's cleaning up, let's play a little bit of the Abyss remix.
2951833	2953354	This is Abyss, the Heaven's Mix.
2953714	2958656	And if you remember Ryu, who did Starmind and Fourth Mix, he's the guy who remixed this.
2958756	2959677	Here, a little clip of this.
2975390	2977111	It doesn't sound a goddamn thing like the original.
2977352	2981315	Judging by the key presses, which I heard very loudly, that's either a 5 or 6.
2983777	2985338	Could have been Light 7, just to throw you, though.
2986199	2988021	In fact, if they're recording it, they probably did it in Light 7.
2988061	2990162	It could have been me trying to play a 7-star song.
2991083	2992685	Okay, this one I'm really excited about.
2992705	2996027	This is the new ping-pong song, Power Dream, and this song really kicks ass.
2996047	2997869	I'm looking forward to hearing the better quality version of this.
3018306	3040780	Ding, ding, ding That just totally sounds like digital mind A little bit, a little bit But it's got its own happy carnival If it's tech, it's not happy Virtual mind, I'm sorry There you go, okay If it's tech, it's not happy Shit, what's that other one?
3040880	3046524	Mind Parasite I knew it had mind in it, god damn it Mind Parasite, it sounds just like Mind Parasite
3047375	3051102	I've lost my mind, they're coming to take me away, haha
3059423	3064344	Next one we're going to preview for you, the last one we're going to preview for you, this is Prelude, and this is one I'm excited about.
3064384	3065265	This is the new Naoki Underground song.
3065305	3067385	I thought you were excited about the other one.
3067705	3067905	What?
3068285	3069666	About the nine parasite.
3070246	3072126	No, well, I am, I'm, whatever.
3072466	3073207	Let's just hear this.
3073247	3073987	Now I remember!
3074207	3074567	Hold on.
3074867	3075887	Yeah, stop for a sec.
3076508	3076968	Glacial.
3077468	3082149	It was going to be a cover by Ryu Kosaka of Hypo Yorubi.
3083326	3084147	Oh, God.
3084488	3085108	That's what it is.
3085769	3086129	Now I remember.
3087291	3088612	I actually like Hyper Eurobeat.
3088772	3090254	There's one song I'm less excited about.
3090735	3091055	All right.
3092437	3093498	The new System SF song.
3093538	3093758	Yay.
3093838	3094058	Okay.
3095280	3095640	Here we go.
3095680	3097562	This is a little clip of Prelude by Naoki Underground.
3097582	3098944	This is my favorite so far, I think.
3120291	3121771	It's like L'Amour et la Liberté.
3121871	3123092	What did you say before that, though?
3123112	3125252	You said something... I was like, yay, it's another classical piece.
3125512	3127032	Yay, another classical piece they ripped off.
3127052	3128953	Yay, it's Vanity Angel all over again.
3129313	3132574	Now I'm going to preview for you Prelude featuring Paula Terry.
3139335	3139655	Rob?
3140015	3140315	Yes?
3141255	3141535	Rob?
3142676	3144096	I'm sorry, but now you have to die.
3145236	3145736	Give me that!
3148037	3149077	I have two microphones now.
3150520	3155664	No, no, what that should be is Prelude featuring Mr. Ryan and whatever the final band.
3155724	3159647	If it was Prelude featuring someone farting, it would sound better than Politary.
3160808	3161228	Anyway.
3162709	3164370	Prelude featuring my ass!
3164650	3165431	Where's the burrito?
3168913	3170394	Prelude featuring my bunghole!
3170555	3170875	Okay.
3170935	3171015	Um...
3176511	3177072	Moving on.
3177873	3179796	Another interesting bit of news here.
3179936	3181218	I was given this tip.
3181418	3186244	I was given a tip, a lead, from a fellow in our chat room who goes by the name John Fields.
3187066	3189168	And Project Majestic Mix.
3190550	3192833	I have no idea who that is, but I think they're a band.
3194662	3197463	However, they have a newsletter, and this is what their newsletter says.
3197943	3210346	In light of our new dance album in the works, some of you may be interested to know that we have obtained permission and are working planning to include our very own DDR PC Max CD-ROM game as part of the limited edition extra.
3210826	3212227	Your computer fell apart.
3214127	3216108	Rob, is your computer feeling fresh?
3216128	3217968	You're laughing at the computer, not the story, right?
3218008	3218988	My computer is just ghetto.
3219068	3220369	Okay, let me finish.
3220389	3220869	Can I finish?
3221109	3221449	Can I finish?
3224700	3227962	Majestic, oh, they did remixes of Final Fantasy music.
3229142	3234184	Anyway, the whole graphics, sound effects, music, and announcer voices are planned to be 100% original.
3234225	3239827	We not only plan on including DDR versions of some of the new album music, but some remixes from our other album releases.
3240467	3243209	Gee, that sounds like Step Mania to me, you ass.
3243669	3244509	Freaking idiots.
3244669	3247250	Wait a minute, this could be officially Konami endorsed, though.
3247290	3248331	That's the big deal about this.
3248351	3249391	Uh-huh, uh-huh.
3249592	3250012	Sure.
3250032	3250432	Sure.
3251072	3252333	Wait a minute though, wait a minute though.
3252553	3255896	Would somebody who's putting out like a bonafide real album be that risky?
3256356	3258678	It's gotta be Blessed by Konami if they're gonna rip off a DDR interface.
3258718	3264022	I'll have you know that my next track will be in the next DDR Max 3 for the home version, yes.
3264943	3265383	A new track.
3265403	3266364	In fact, it's all my music.
3266584	3269466	In fact, they're giving me all the proceeds from that.
3269927	3271288	Could you listen to this part again, Loki?
3271688	3273529	We have obtained permission.
3274770	3275371	Which would mean...
3275834	3276334	Good on me, right?
3276354	3277035	Which means crap.
3277075	3282077	It means we've obtained permission to remix their music, saying that we won't permission to slap you.
3283098	3283798	That's all it says.
3284138	3287240	That means look for a press kit, look for the press releases.
3287340	3289521	It means don't jack shit.
3289701	3291502	It means jack shit, exactly.
3291602	3297646	It means that they've obtained permission to remix the official songs that they made from the DDR home versions.
3298266	3299106	That's all it is.
3300007	3301648	Can I remix this song?
3302088	3303549	Sure, son, why not?
3309155	3310616	I was just thinking if there's anything on their site.
3310716	3312537	Whatever, you know, fine.
3312777	3313738	If it is, yay.
3313778	3315239	You know, whatever.
3315319	3316780	DDR PC sucks anyways.
3317641	3319002	Mr. Spanky!
3320142	3321303	Well, we shall see what happens.
3321543	3324505	Oh, maybe it's DDR Ultramix.
3324625	3329148	Alright, Majestic Mix, if you're listening, surprise the pants off of Loki, because that would be funny.
3330569	3331370	DDR Meow Mix?
3333897	3336199	Did you tell everyone about the Will & Grace episode?
3351963	3354184	Will and Grace is gay.
3354605	3358987	Yeah, it's about, you know, a fag and his... No, not the show, the episode.
3359507	3364850	Okay, well, it's Grace's birthday and Jack and Karen take her out to an arcade and there's a fifth mix and they play it.
3366091	3367092	What song do they play?
3367672	3371254	Well, they don't play songs that are really in DDR.
3371454	3374076	Well, Jack plays Holiday, but not like the DDR version.
3374096	3374556	What about
3376141	3378785	Well, it has the background to Abyss, which is funny.
3378825	3380547	Holiday has Abyss' background, apparently.
3380867	3384011	Like, on the screen, it says Abyss, and he's playing Holiday.
3384071	3388517	But, like, when she's going to play another game, there was, like, Puzzle Fighter 2 or something.
3388798	3392783	Like, it was playing Abyss in the background, and it played Dynamite Rave also while the kid was playing.
3392983	3394345	Yeah, the little kid was playing Dynamite Rave.
3397914	3398554	And then Grace.
3398654	3400835	It was so funny to watch Grace dance.
3400936	3405718	You make it sound like my anti-TV stance is like total social deprivation.
3405738	3405978	It is.
3406738	3407338	Well... Shut up.
3407358	3408019	I didn't ask you.
3408079	3412721	It was sort of wrong.
3412761	3416462	My life is much more enriched through reading fanfiction.
3417143	3418043	I mean, books.
3418844	3421785	But is DDR in your fanfic episodes?
3423312	3423773	They could be.
3426095	3427957	I will put DDR in my next story.
3427997	3428397	How's that?
3429038	3429398	Fair enough.
3429498	3429959	Oh, doorbell.
3429979	3431080	Let's see who comes to the door now.
3431520	3432141	Who's going to get it?
3432301	3432521	Loki.
3432561	3434923	I bet it's... Oh, Brian's got it.
3435724	3437726	I bet it's... Oh, no, our intern.
3439107	3440488	I have no idea who's coming through the door.
3440709	3441389	It's our intern.
3441469	3442851	It's our intern zero.
3443011	3443451	Hello.
3443471	3444152	Do you have anybody with you?
3445106	3445806	Um, yeah.
3446306	3447187	This is Jim.
3447847	3448567	Hi, Jim.
3448627	3449447	He's from Fremont.
3449887	3450888	Hi, Jim from Fremont.
3450908	3451948	Everyone can say hi.
3452888	3453628	And who else is here?
3453908	3454348	Anita.
3454569	3455229	Hi, Anita.
3455369	3455949	Johnny.
3456609	3457329	Hey, everybody.
3457349	3458009	And Jason.
3458570	3459970	Dang, what the hell?
3460070	3461350	There's a party all of a sudden.
3461370	3464191	Yeah, we all fit in a clown car.
3464371	3469653	I'm sitting here going, gee, we've got like only the three of us here at house, and then all of a sudden everybody's showing up.
3469673	3470873	Yeah, the clown car show.
3470893	3471153	Hello.
3472549	3473149	What's up, everyone?
3473329	3473770	This is Jim.
3473870	3474570	Nice to meet you all.
3474590	3475451	Do you play DDR at all?
3475751	3476571	I'm afraid to say no.
3477592	3478212	You'll fit right in.
3478352	3479052	All right, Anita.
3479453	3480793	Hi, DDRcoholic here.
3480873	3481994	How is everybody?
3482574	3482794	Good.
3482834	3483995	How's your DDR addiction?
3484775	3488457	Oh, well, I'm on step nine of the 12-step program.
3489278	3491499	It's coming along.
3491619	3492279	It's coming along fine.
3492419	3494020	Remember, NyQuil's the 13th step.
3494460	3499883	NyQuil is the 13th step, and I am almost ready with my case of NyQuil.
3500503	3501484	I'm just waiting to open it.
3503295	3506217	And we have... It's D-Child.
3506537	3508579	God, I'm so fucking tired right now.
3508719	3509959	Well, how late did you stay up?
3511280	3513562	Uh... Did you stay up to greet the Easter Bunny?
3514682	3515103	Yeah.
3515923	3517324	I greeted the Easter Bunny all right.
3520586	3521427	Where's my damn candy?
3522167	3523928	Yeah, so anyway, yeah, DDR on Will and Grace.
3524028	3524729	Ha, that was funny.
3525834	3528755	That was probably the dumbest thing I've heard all day.
3528795	3528975	Yeah.
3555003	3555984	About, yeah, yeah.
3558845	3560146	Oh, who else, who else is here?
3560166	3561207	Oh, there's somebody in the hall.
3564269	3565169	Hi, what's up?
3565189	3566310	This is Bombay.
3571493	3573334	I got to beat your character up today in Soul Calibur.
3576096	3577257	Did you, did you beat her hard?
3578246	3581969	I beat her long and hard with my lesbian character.
3583270	3584090	With the big titties.
3584110	3585851	They're all lesbians.
3586072	3588853	This is the first time I've played Soul Calibur 2 in a long, long time.
3588894	3590074	Taki is the dyke of the game.
3590395	3592096	She's also the dominatrix.
3592876	3596018	But then suddenly I was... Taki is... She does whatever.
3596119	3597019	She's good for anything.
3598300	3600081	And then Cassandra's the quick lay.
3600121	3600822	She does everybody.
3602083	3604044	Conquest came up and suddenly I'm fighting D-Child.
3604084	3604304	I'm like...
3609832	3611193	Did you fight F-Yo Mama?
3612494	3614415	I don't remember fighting F-Yo Mama.
3616736	3617176	That's it.
3617216	3620638	You're going to find a Killik named DarkSakura in there.
3624160	3625020	Okay, newsflash.
3625080	3627261	His special attribute is cheat bitch power.
3627682	3632144	Newsflash, we have the address to the new TAPEX from Skyline.
3632244	3634945	There's a TAPEX in Sacramento now, in South Sac.
3634965	3637907	Those bitches, my dad was going to make one, and then they brought one here.
3639719	3641821	Yeah, there's one in Southside now, so we might go after the show.
3642762	3650268	Alright, I'd just like to say, coming from the Bay Area where there's real boba and real pearl tea, Tapioca Express is gay.
3651749	3652650	It's all we got!
3653851	3655072	It's really not that bad.
3655092	3659455	I mean, I've tried some of the boba that we had at that one place in Fremont.
3659555	3660756	Was that real boba?
3661637	3663619	Okay, their boba is just as good.
3663799	3664719	What, like lolly cup?
3664739	3666341	No, dude.
3669337	3670880	Any other Bomani news you can think of, Loki?
3670920	3672322	Was there anything else this week we had to talk about?
3674265	3675086	Yeah, your car.
3675527	3676608	Want to talk about your car?
3676648	3677529	That was funny.
3677730	3682016	Tell us all about the car prank you played while I look up to see if there's any other news we're missing.
3682337	3683378	That was hilarious.
3684669	3702966	at my work on Friday they brought for a promotional thing for Fast and Furious the tricked out edition DVD that's coming out they brought one of the cars from Too Fast Too Furious which I must say that this car while being in the movie was stock and it just had a nice paint job it was
3703286	3716401	which was sort of getting chipped and actually someone stole the exhaust off of it they physically cut the exhaust off with a hacksaw that was hilarious but yeah, it was really cool and no one could tell but
3716912	3725540	I took my friend Andy, who's kind of a fanatic about the whole thing, he took pictures of him taking the car off of the trailer and stuff, and then I took a picture inside the car.
3725941	3734209	So I thought it'd be really funny, because, you know, I was really bored that day, to post pictures online of me sitting in the car telling people that I bought the car off of eBay.
3734449	3738573	Because if anyone knows me, I have just been buying shit off of eBay like crazy.
3738653	3741976	So it's slightly believable, but then again, yeah.
3743666	3751492	I first started getting suspicious when I saw it was parked on a sidewalk, but then just to check on how much they were, I went on eBay, and those cars aren't that bad priced.
3751532	3757056	I saw a Beamer that was fully tricked out for under $30,000, and I mean, Beamers for under $30,000, that's pretty good.
3758499	3761700	Yeah, so anyways, I had a couple people go in there for like a little bit.
3762020	3776146	I was waiting for Rob because Rob, I was thinking, you know, see now, it was so much for Afterthought, but I was going to say, you know, I should have posted, yeah, Rob, I need to borrow like $500 because I spent too much money on this.
3776546	3778226	But instead, no, I didn't do that.
3778406	3779807	Oh, you're so kind.
3779827	3781548	And he saw right through because he knew me better.
3781608	3784349	He knew that I'd buy a DDR machine before I'd buy a nice car, so.
3785809	3786089	Yeah.
3787070	3787570	I got you.
3789062	3789482	I try.
3791084	3791785	I'm fucking great.
3793126	3796469	Okay, so... Any other of my news you can think of?
3796649	3797250	Ultramix.
3798031	3799172	Is there new news on Ultramix?
3799808	3800509	Uh, no.
3801770	3802550	Well, thanks!
3804031	3804612	Bravo!
3804632	3806133	It's just out there in limbo.
3806613	3807874	Um... Shit.
3808835	3811197	Um... Not really anything else.
3811877	3814279	Um... Well, there's sim news, I guess.
3814879	3815920	Oh, what about Tournament Explore?
3816080	3817581	Tournament Explore has been announced.
3817902	3819523	It's gonna be on June 15th.
3819923	3820383	That's all.
3820624	3821344	That's all I've got.
3821584	3822105	It's just a date.
3822665	3823506	Just June 15th.
3824106	3827549	And, um... And, uh...
3829088	3834357	Oh yeah, we were still going to be doing a TV show DWI contest, but we got lazy and haven't really planned for it yet.
3834437	3837562	So look for a big announcement at B3.
3839972	3841333	Okay, that'll give us enough time.
3841353	3842073	Yes, yes, look for that.
3842693	3844974	That'll give us plenty of time to get up off our ass and do something.
3844994	3847155	There's also, well, a couple things.
3847635	3860800	Bomani Style, they've opened up, well, they're going to be opening up, I haven't gotten my email yet, but opening up a leech server for all those who contributed to them, which I did, so I will get access to a leech server with a bunch of cool shit on it.
3860820	3861600	Ooh, you're special.
3861781	3862181	I know I am.
3862781	3867823	And then there's also, let's see, this guy Shuey, who I've been working with, he's
3868243	3872664	He's starting a project called, um, was it the DWI History Project or whatever?
3872884	3877306	Anyways, he has up-to-date every single sim file that's ever been made.
3877526	3877866	Pretty much.
3879246	3881307	Another question coming from the chatroom from Skyline.
3881327	3882347	Are we going to E3?
3883327	3883787	Probably not.
3884688	3886328	Unless someone gives us tickets really fast.
3886408	3894950	I've been asking that in, um... I can get the time off work in a... in Jiffy, but... I've been asking that, um, but I don't know.
3896971	3897051	Uh...
3900325	3900625	I don't know.
3900825	3905248	I have tickets for The Matrix Reloaded that day, so it's a gimme.
3905268	3906849	I was like, I want to see The Matrix.
3908289	3908650	I don't know.
3908930	3912952	To be honest, I don't think I have the money to go to E3, but I would like to anyway.
3913012	3913332	I do.
3913412	3913933	I want to go.
3915133	3917034	I would fucking blow someone to go to E3.
3917535	3917775	What?
3919416	3920236	Let's go hang out on the street.
3920256	3922497	I'll come up with tickets pretty quick.
3924138	3927300	Let's go hang out on the street corner in front of E3 and see if we can't get in.
3927480	3927960	Okay.
3929409	3933853	We can film it and do wacky shit and disguise ourselves like stuff.
3934153	3935575	Hey, we're the wacky media.
3935595	3940699	We can pretend we're bums and then the bum fight people will pay us to beat each other up and then I'll kick your ass.
3940959	3941460	It'll be fine.
3941500	3945143	And you know, someone with some kind of military-based first-person shooter is bound to be there.
3945163	3946624	We can dress Rob up like a booth babe.
3949247	3950167	I can be Riku.
3952629	3956373	With all the military games, just dress in camel and walk right in like you're part of the show.
3958231	3964753	Okay, we want to do a list list pretty soon here, but we need time to think about it.
3964793	3967694	Yeah, we need to do FU's of the week still, and we need to do the cage match.
3967934	3969195	So, what first?
3969655	3970295	FU's or cage match?
3970655	3971155	FU's.
3971235	3971835	FU's, alright, fine.
3971855	3976517	We're going to go to a quick break, and we'll come back and do the FU's of the week.
3976717	3977237	Okay, kids?
3977377	3983039	So, you can send them over a private message to moi, my name is Sky, hi, and I'm in the chat room.
3984678	3991400	Sky High, very cute.
3991440	3996961	I'm in the chat room and send me your FUs of the week over private message and we'll get to those right when we come back.
3997001	4003842	In the meantime, here's that new special little paranoia that's going to be in Max 2, or so they say, the Japanese home release.
4003882	4009843	Coming out this week, this is Paranoia Sur... And I have it on order too, with the VRare soundtrack.
4009924	4010184	Yay!
4011224	4011804	Here's a cookie.
4011864	4011924	Yay!
4013434	4014611	Here's Paranoia Survivor.
4014671	4014894	Enjoy.
4290507	4291768	Orange Lounge Radio.
4292088	4294249	We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
4300873	4302134	Alright kids, here we go.
4302734	4303395	As promised.
4309838	4310659	Wait for it.
4311259	4312180	Wait for it.
4317343	4319444	My fucking leak goes to Squeenix.
4320379	4324341	Damn you, Square Enix, whatever the fuck you're calling yourself.
4324721	4326362	I call you Squeenix because you suck.
4328103	4335407	Fuck you for not listening to me and for not listening to Michelle because we had this discussion earlier today.
4336127	4337868	Damn you for sucking so bad.
4338568	4340709	For not making Kingdom Hearts the way we want you to.
4342110	4344911	First of all, thank you for waiting until 2004 to release Kingdom Hearts 2.
4349218	4349598	Bitches.
4349818	4350178	Bitches.
4353039	4357121	Damn you for not taking advantage of your other licensing.
4357861	4369085	And I can tell you this right now, that if you do not take advantage of the Enix Association and go and bust some new characters on Kingdom Hearts 2, I will personally go to Tokyo in a tank and run you all over.
4369925	4376187	I will put collars on your necks and enact Battle Royale, and then whoever wins the Battle Royale...
4377799	4379120	I'll go, okay, you can go.
4379180	4381241	We'll take the collar off and then I'll stick a knife in your head.
4384103	4385404	Gosh, Jamie, you're really mean.
4386965	4387725	No, no, no, no, no.
4388145	4388526	No, no.
4388686	4394989	Before I put the knife in their head, I'll shave their balls with a cheese grater and pour alcohol on it.
4396330	4397851	She's productive, okay?
4398612	4399452	I get results.
4399632	4399912	Yes.
4400133	4400593	That's right.
4400833	4404155	And then once I... You'll feed them the flake first.
4404747	4407869	And then I'll make them drink down the alcohol with the blood mixed in it afterwards.
4408369	4409690	Gosh, Jamie, you're a real bitch.
4410271	4412832	Not wasting anything.
4413032	4414193	Not wasting one thing.
4414473	4417675	They're drinking the alcohol that has the blood and the, like, sequestering.
4418796	4423839	And then once I've taken over Squeenix, first of all, I'm going to give it a cool name.
4424259	4425840	It'll be called Cute.
4427101	4428202	How about Spike?
4429022	4429743	It'll be called...
4431335	4434738	It'll be called Not Squeamix, how's that?
4435899	4456177	And then once I've taken it over, I'm going to make my own freaking RPG Because I'm going to take advantage of all those licenses And because of the association with Sony, Sony's got their fingers in everything I'm going to have the ultimate RPG I can think of one thing they don't have their fingers in I'm just saying
4457909	4465312	And then, and then, and then I'm going to make my own gaming system because nothing that's out right now will be able to use it.
4466432	4471554	And then I'm going to take over Gravity and make Ragnarok Online cool.
4471594	4475435	I'm not making an Xbox.
4476616	4480317	Fuck you all, we're making it for our system, you can't have it unless you buy our expensive system.
4480477	4482658	All I heard Jamie say was I'm taking over Gravity.
4484461	4485701	Like, now she's taking on the force.
4485961	4487482	Mother Nature, burn!
4488622	4489882	Yeah, fuck you, Nature.
4490423	4491983	I'm rewriting physics, dammit.
4492063	4493283	I've got the Moldyver power.
4493943	4494243	Anyway.
4495104	4498545	My next fuck you of the week goes toward this troll who was on the road behind me.
4498585	4499245	There's more?
4499605	4500645	There's more.
4501885	4508727	This... And again, and again... Again, I'm not a shallow person, usually.
4509227	4512328	This person made me think that Trogdor was gorgeous.
4515185	4520848	This person, this person made Corky in the Wonder Years.
4521788	4523629	You mean Life Goes On.
4523669	4524950	Life Goes On.
4524990	4526030	Looked like a beauty queen.
4532113	4532974	I miss America.
4534875	4535815	And then this bitch.
4536135	4536436	What?
4537336	4538737	Decides to tailgate me.
4538797	4539397	Chewing gum.
4539957	4543059	Going from my apartment to Harrow's.
4544494	4546575	and then gets in the other lane like, y'all, I'm gonna pass her?
4548156	4553880	So, I start going, when she's right behind me, I start going 5 miles an hour on girls.
4555461	4556782	She speeds up, I go, 50!
4556982	4562546	I was like, bless you, car, for having some acceleration this time.
4562866	4564207	Let's hear it for High Octane Gas.
4566028	4569691	My other fuck you of the week goes toward not having money.
4570586	4571707	Until after I work some more.
4571727	4572407	There's more?
4572707	4574108	Oh, bye!
4575148	4575389	Ow!
4575689	4578130	We wouldn't have Fuck You's of the Week if it weren't for me.
4578150	4579171	I'm teasing, I'm teasing.
4579671	4583353	It goes to not having money, so I couldn't go to Sakura Lattery yesterday.
4583993	4587675	It's my birthday, like I do every year except for last year because I went to Alabama instead.
4589376	4591537	However, I did get lots of meat and stuff.
4592217	4592938	And ice cream.
4594078	4595559	Lots and lots of ice cream.
4596139	4596700	Yay!
4597460	4598601	Yes, and then, um...
4599781	4604564	My other fuck you, Lalique Guess we're not having any more fuck yous, aha!
4605444	4606225	There's more?
4606385	4607866	Oh wait, there's not anymore?
4609026	4623254	Fuck you, Squeenix Fuck you and your ear, cause your ass ain't good enough Actually, their ear's not even good enough Fuck you and someone else's orifice On that note, Loki, what do you have to say?
4624995	4626456	Alright, the first one
4626909	4628972	The first fuck you is going to be going to America.
4629714	4630114	Okay?
4630635	4631857	Well, let's just...
4633055	4638538	Thank you, America, for leaving, letting Carmen Rasputin fucking stay on American Idol.
4639119	4641020	God damn it, she sounds like a fucking goat.
4641420	4642981	Okay, do you like goat music?
4643221	4644222	Do you like goat music?
4644562	4646183	Fuck, seriously, they must... Hold on.
4646483	4647184	Stop the presses.
4647324	4647944	Stop the presses.
4648545	4653027	This is the one thing I never, ever, ever, ever expected Loki to be ranting about.
4653288	4653568	Ever.
4654588	4655229	This is great.
4655249	4656830	This is a moment in Orange Lounge history.
4657810	4658551	Start your recorders.
4659261	4660262	Hey, you are recording this.
4660322	4660882	I want a copy.
4661442	4666966	I want my AOL to start with Fuck You to American Idol in his voice.
4668086	4670548	The MP3 and the DWI come out later this week.
4670628	4671168	Anyway, resume.
4673890	4675271	Alright, we'll do another thing recording.
4675291	4677032	Thank you for making me snort my Propel.
4678956	4680318	Fuck you, American Idol.
4680398	4682941	No, actually, fuck you people that voted for Carmen.
4683201	4683682	What the hell?
4683702	4685444	Two weeks in the fucking row.
4685644	4688748	You fucking vote off other good people, leave her on there.
4689088	4691011	What, you think you're going to get laid by her or something?
4691131	4692873	Our chat room is just going off.
4692953	4693954	They all agree with you.
4695616	4696738	Goddamn, that stupid bitch!
4696978	4698881	I knew y'all were in the American Idol closet.
4698901	4705950	I was so, I was so wishing... I mean, I didn't like, you know, Ricky that much, and I didn't like, you know, whoever her name was.
4706010	4707792	Julia D'Amato ruined Flashdance.
4707833	4708594	She must die.
4708914	4709334	Man, but...
4711777	4713838	I swear, what was she singing the other day?
4713878	4723602	I don't remember what it was, but it sounded like... It's just like... Yeah, seriously.
4723682	4730725	If you want to sing like a fucking country star, there's another channel for you with this stupid country version of American Idol.
4730785	4733106	Go there and get out of American Idol.
4733166	4735407	Because you're going to lose anyway to fucking Ruben.
4735487	4736607	Ruben's going to kick your ass.
4736947	4738408	I have a special message to Michelle.
4739454	4741074	That boy is mine, you stay away.
4743895	4744155	Alright.
4744315	4744655	Resume.
4745035	4749196	Alright, and now another FDU2 fucking roulette on DDR Extreme.
4749496	4750496	How you mock me?
4750916	4754717	Dammit, giving me fucking Crash and then Sakura after I played Sakura.
4755857	4756537	I hate you.
4756897	4760778	Stupid, and you taunt me with your goddamn getting on Legend of Max and then moving down.
4760878	4761738	Moving down, moving down.
4761778	4762558	You better watch out, Rob.
4762618	4768119	Up, down, fucking A. Um, I've gotten Legend of Max four times in a row.
4772148	4774490	Not even gonna do it, because I will end up killing him.
4774690	4776171	Someone get him a cookie!
4777672	4780915	No, but seriously, I hate that fucking machine, and it sucks ass.
4781035	4784057	Also, FU to the fuck- But I thought Cutie Chaser was your favorite song.
4784538	4787220	Oh, it was my favorite song until I started getting crashed all the time.
4787520	4788881	Crash, and I'm gonna get ya.
4790202	4791583	I'm gonna get- Yeah, no.
4791963	4792224	Sorry.
4792404	4793685	I don't like that song anymore either.
4794025	4796307	It's like, it gives me all the songs that people don't play.
4796507	4797908	Hmm, let's see, what song sucks?
4797928	4798789	Let's give him back.
4798869	4799109	Okay.
4799569	4800190	But no, um...
4801292	4808538	Also, uh, Nephew to the DDR Max 2 machine that was at Scandi because your arrow was broken and, yeah, and they turned off, but, I'm sorry.
4809299	4816745	Um, Nephew to the stupid drivers, stupid people, and... I don't know.
4817025	4822910	Nephew is back and my turntables haven't gotten here yet because this stupid guy slacked off on sending them to me because he sucks.
4823730	4824331	And, um...
4825714	4826415	Yeah, that's it.
4826455	4827195	I'm done for now.
4827636	4829337	I would just like to take this moment to read.
4829498	4831600	I'm looking at one page of our chat room.
4831640	4832080	Here we go.
4832200	4834162	Just some random lines here.
4834923	4837765	Dude, Rob, you can have Jim Barraros, but I want Clay.
4837825	4838987	But Clay is humble pie.
4839127	4840388	Let the black win, dammit.
4840808	4842210	STFU, Ruben is cool.
4842430	4843911	But I think Clay is gay anyway.
4844972	4847074	We've turned into Channel Pound American Idol.
4847094	4847895	Congratulations.
4848095	4848756	Actually, okay.
4849156	4849917	Thank you, Loki.
4850868	4852949	Clay can sing, but he can't perform, okay?
4852989	4854589	No, no, this is not American Idol chat.
4854609	4856210	This is the episode of the week.
4856270	4857570	I'm going to do my Carmen one more time.
4857590	4857770	Ready?
4858430	4858630	Ready?
4859871	4862632	God bless the USA!
4862652	4863572	That's another thing.
4863732	4864992	Another thing about American Idol.
4865373	4869794	Fucking A, if you sing God bless USA one more time, I hope they fucking bomb your ass.
4870154	4873336	Because seriously, how many times do you sell out about these stupid shows?
4873536	4877439	And another F you that's stupid reality TV with the goddamn Mr. Personality.
4877639	4880361	Yeah, let's get Mrs. Personality on there, Monica Lewinsky.
4880381	4882863	Yeah, she doesn't judge people before she goes down on them.
4883635	4886055	Fucking lame bitch, and then they give her own joke.
4886076	4887436	She's a nobody.
4887456	4888656	She sucks some guy's dick.
4889136	4890396	She designs purses.
4890656	4892077	Oh, whoop-dee-doo, she designs purses.
4892197	4893177	Oh, I'm sorry.
4893197	4899138	Seriously, she sucks ass and shouldn't be on here.
4899738	4902479	This is the sound of Monica Lewinsky sucking shit.
4903299	4904499	I mean, what's she gonna do?
4904719	4907340	Pull all the runners up, get my special treatment.
4907440	4907780	Yeah.
4908280	4909260	Okay, anyways, I'm done.
4910540	4911201	Alright, my turn?
4911941	4912761	That was beautiful.
4912821	4913281	It's my turn?
4915047	4915968	My FU of the week.
4916268	4920250	That moves me to, you know, gastric movement.
4920550	4920890	Thank you.
4921631	4922411	My FU of the week.
4922551	4923812	My FU of the week goes to Madonna.
4928295	4930556	Because Madonna...
4932065	4932505	You bitch.
4933025	4936306	That new video you have for American Life sucks my balls.
4936767	4939647	It is the worst, most unimaginative thing I've ever seen in my life.
4940128	4941548	Your original video was better.
4942028	4942829	Way, way better.
4942869	4946670	You know, it wasn't the best video you've done, but it was way better than that piece of shit you put on VH1.
4947150	4952952	You know, if you didn't want to ruffle feathers with the whole anti-war thing, even though the video isn't anti-war, it's all like tongue-in-cheek anyway.
4954042	4957824	Just spend $50 at least to make a decent video.
4957984	4960726	I did college projects that were better than that shit.
4961106	4961907	Madonna, you suck.
4962687	4964608	But the album comes out Tuesday and I'm buying it anyway.
4965049	4971312	Alright, my other FU of the week goes to Muheimer because he says that Kimberly Locke sucks and Kimberly Locke is a goddess.
4971433	4971773	Fuck you.
4978777	4980098	Shut up.
4980418	4981038	Jamie has another one.
4981078	4981459	Okay, yes.
4982802	5001728	Fuck all of you people for watching TV and having rotten minds who only focus on that one tube that puts the picture forth, that your brains are attached to, and your whole life depends on, and you have no social... I have no idea what you're talking about.
5001748	5002928	Next.
5002948	5007610	Don't you do that when you play, um, when you're not playing, but it's not a fast game or not a fast game?
5008683	5008903	All right.
5028581	5029562	for being easy.
5030163	5030823	Oh my god.
5031324	5032965	Let's move on to the rest of the room chat room.
5033246	5034407	Or the rest of the room FU.
5034447	5034827	Zero!
5035668	5036329	Oh no, it's really cool.
5036389	5037910	I have like a Madonna FU too.
5038991	5039372	Okay.
5039552	5042795	No, today I was watching television.
5043375	5049922	And anyways, they were talking about how she's trying to make an effort against... Okay, but TV.
5051792	5054814	Anyways, yeah, like I was trying to say as she hops out of the room.
5056555	5060197	She's trying to combat music piracy also.
5060617	5067201	She had a bunch of people get online, and she has her actual voice, where, like, you'll download the full length of the song, right?
5067642	5070223	But it'll just start off, like, the first six seconds is the only thing.
5070263	5072424	It'll say, what the fuck do you think you're doing?
5073025	5074746	That was fucking great, actually.
5075006	5076227	It's funny, but it's like...
5077429	5079074	You really think you're going to do something.
5079134	5080338	You know, it's not the only one doing that, though.
5080358	5084128	I tried to download the new Jewel single, Don't Ask Me Why, I just was, and it did the same thing.
5085248	5086869	Well, if she wasn't going, what the fuck are you looking at?
5086889	5089770	It just looped the chorus over and over, and I got no doubts on that did that.
5090050	5091891	People are doing that, all the stuff.
5091911	5093071	Yeah, you know what?
5093111	5094292	That's not going to stop anything.
5094372	5095652	You can do whatever.
5096132	5097733	Good luck, RIAA.
5097833	5098453	You suck.
5098513	5101135	You're never going to fucking stop us from pirating your music.
5102395	5104996	I laugh at you wasting billions of dollars trying to try.
5105316	5105756	Go ahead.
5105796	5107437	We'll just go out and find a way around that.
5108798	5109238	You go, boy.
5111218	5111498	Zero.
5111578	5112359	It's not very hard.
5112779	5115741	No, um, another one, I gotta give an F you to my fucking computer.
5115921	5118023	No, fuck you to cable, having a cable modem.
5118283	5120845	I have to burn a fucking CD every goddamn day.
5121305	5125348	Cause like, first of all, my fucking computer is a piece of shit and has a small hard drive.
5125968	5127970	I fill it up with music, like, every day.
5128490	5130051	I don't have the money for a new fucking hard drive.
5130932	5132613	I don't have the money for that yet, so I get a job.
5132633	5134334	Wait, I have a job, I start tomorrow, alright.
5134815	5139678	But anyways, like, I have to burn a CD, I'm already out of fucking CDs because fucking music is too damn good.
5140956	5145018	Yeah, and, um, fuck you to, uh, who the fuck is that?
5145398	5155942	Some stupid bitch yesterday, um, I was, like, walking over to the store, this is in the afternoon, and some stupid bitch at the fucking crosswalk just walks into me!
5156762	5157963	No fucking reason, this is like...
5159193	5163316	I'm standing there, I'm pushing the button, that's right, because I was going to get a calling card to call my friend in another country.
5163837	5171102	And this fucking bitch crosses the street, and, like, I'm not standing on the corner, and she, like, just runs into me and knocks me into the fucking pole.
5172743	5176646	And I looked at her, and I looked at her, and she, like, said, what the fuck's your problem?
5177700	5179863	I said, I didn't believe you just made up these names.
5199059	5200080	I just explained the whole story.
5200500	5210367	I was sitting there, and some stupid ChronoCore bitch came and ran into me, knocked me into the bowl on the corner when I was walking up to get a calling card, and she said that, you know, I was a bitch, and she said she was gonna cut me.
5210407	5211367	Because I called her ChronoCore.
5211488	5214209	But anyways, that's all my FUs, because that was fucking stupid.
5214650	5216151	And fuck even not having any more FUs.
5216591	5216911	Alright.
5218412	5220013	Does, um, does Jim have any FUs?
5220173	5220474	Yeah.
5221875	5222835	Alright, skip Jim for a second.
5223055	5223716	Let's go to Irene.
5223736	5223836	Irene.
5224969	5227051	He's disgruntled, so yeah, there's gonna be a lot of him.
5227952	5229113	Oh, I love this song.
5229133	5230234	Fuck this song.
5230414	5242166	Fuck you to guys that, like, stare at girls and, you know, oogle at girls, like, in front of their girlfriends, like, and make silly remarks and stuff, like...
5244378	5247283	Um, well, maybe I should finish this before Brad gets here, you know, yeah.
5247623	5255614	And, like, you know, you gotta like a band for more than, you know, just what some chick wears, you know, some stupid corseter.
5256776	5257417	Oh, yeah, that too.
5257637	5258378	I like Switzerland.
5258439	5259680	Isn't Switzerland a great country?
5259720	5260602	Don't you like Switzerland?
5261813	5262233	Shut up!
5262273	5262994	This is my F.U. !
5277825	5279647	Okay, Zero, give the FUs for somebody else.
5279687	5288016	Okay, this is kind of like a battle FU between them, but, like, Dark Child, first off, he says, fuck you to loud-ass bass at 3 o'clock in the morning as he's trying to sleep.
5288616	5292640	Um, I guess apparently, um, Bombay was playing his music a little bit too loud at 3 o'clock in the morning.
5292660	5293341	Kiss, kiss.
5293802	5296885	Yes, well, yeah, that's right, we need to get him some boxes, huh?
5297882	5303727	No, seriously, I'll come over this week and pack a cell phone for you.
5303767	5305308	Can you put it on the driveway?
5305408	5306709	Switzerland's a great place.
5306869	5308450	Wait, we can do the whole Strong Bad thing.
5308750	5314955	Maybe we should put your stereo on the street and find more stuff you'd like to give to me.
5315115	5315676	I mean, the people.
5316767	5320550	I'll put you in the driveway back over it, except I don't want all that stuff to get in my wheels.
5320910	5322692	Okay, but anyways, yeah, back to that, yeah.
5322872	5324473	He got pretty pissed off.
5324893	5329397	And he said that, like, if he wasn't, um, if he wasn't so tired, he would've got up and, like, beat some ass.
5329977	5330698	I wish he was awake.
5331358	5336803	Um, and then he says, fuck you to 80s... Hold on!
5337423	5340345	Damn, fucking 80s, all of a sudden everyone fucks around and gets pissed off.
5340385	5340645	What?!
5342307	5343207	Fuck everyone.
5343668	5345849	No, he says, fuck you to 80s... What you talking about, Zero? 80...
5347350	5347930	Oh my god.
5348631	5349111	Fuck you!
5349331	5349971	I heard that shit.
5350512	5357816	No, um, he said, um, fuck you to 80s techno beats and shit because they're all repetitive and looping, and he says they suck ass.
5358736	5367701	And then, and then the one from DD Alcoholic, she decides to say fuck you to Darkchild because she thinks 80s techno is good.
5368541	5369702	Anita's a goddess, what can I say?
5370734	5380123	Yeah, but I kind of wish that Dark Child was awake in the middle of the night because that would have been funny to hear at 3.30 in the morning he gets up and runs out to, like, kill somebody for techno.
5380503	5381004	That'd be cool.
5383946	5384347	Rawr.
5384647	5385047	Yeah, I'm done.
5387458	5395103	Speaking of the 80s, and back sort of reminding me of the conversation from earlier, fuck you to Captain N, the Game Master.
5395623	5397364	Holy shit, I downloaded a bunch of episodes.
5397384	5398865	That show sucked ass.
5398885	5403909	That show was the worst ever, because... And skewed so many of my viewpoints in video game history.
5404029	5408271	Simon was a lot more, like, ballsy-er than they made him to be.
5410073	5411173	But yeah, fuck that show.
5411233	5412234	I just had a memory of that show.
5412254	5415096	Anyway, I'm going to start following things.
5423545	5426787	I don't know.
5426847	5432511	I'm kind of vague on my FUs, really.
5433312	5437655	Can't think of many particular things, but... Shit.
5438956	5439476	I don't know.
5439496	5444079	FU, really, to... Hey, you mentioned reality shows and shit like that.
5444460	5444760	And so...
5445527	5455449	A fair amount of the people who actually watch that shit who, you know, seems to have no real purpose in their lives to spend hours on end in the days to watch this shit all the time.
5455469	5456830	That's what you're talking about, asshole.
5460911	5465992	I honestly can't stand this reality BS because it's not exactly reality.
5466627	5467567	I mean, I don't agree.
5467927	5470008	The reality movie, that's too much.
5470848	5471529	Exactly.
5472229	5473169	Don't even go there!
5473389	5476310	Fucking, that's the dumbest fucking thing I've ever seen!
5476530	5477570	Goddamn real world!
5478031	5478611	Die!
5479871	5483692	Dude, it went up in yellow.
5483712	5484413	That was cool.
5484593	5485473	And your face is purple.
5486253	5488374	My ears are bleeding and your face is purple, Jim.
5489834	5490354	Uh, yeah.
5490755	5490855	Um...
5494744	5495965	God, I got a scatterbrain right now.
5495985	5497126	I can't think of many FUs.
5497426	5504091	Um... This is my dark side talking.
5504131	5510657	You know, fuck you to the entire human race because, you know, you are the plague that is eating this planet alive.
5511337	5516902	Like, you know, exactly... Getting on a little Matrix feel, exactly what Agent Smith said.
5517182	5519924	We are a virus.
5520004	5520644	We are a...
5523254	5525377	Parasite to this planet.
5526157	5531243	I mean, we're pretty much just going to do that shit to every other planet we meet up in along the way.
5532204	5535488	But, yeah, that's it.
5537528	5537849	All right.
5538109	5538970	Chatroom FUs.
5539951	5541572	Fuck the chatroom FUs.
5541612	5542573	DDR Angel.
5542673	5549059	My first FU goes to those stupid people, companies, whatever, that send you those damn text messages to your phone wanting you to buy their shit.
5549119	5549579	I don't care.
5549640	5550440	I don't need your crap.
5550500	5554064	And stop wasting my monthly 200 text messages there for my friends and not you.
5554164	5554524	Grr.
5554944	5557967	FU to my work schedule because I'm going to miss a lot of Orange Ons Radio this week.
5558167	5558588	FU to that.
5559204	5559644	You know what?
5559724	5561424	You can just get free text messaging like I have.
5561764	5564365	I would also recommend suing the companies that are sending that shit to you.
5564825	5567005	You can.
5567085	5575167	John Fields says, F you to people calling me a cult leader and trying to sue me for killing someone when that person is still alive and they know that person is alive.
5576467	5576747	Huh?
5576767	5578748	That was scary.
5578768	5580588	I'd like to be a cult leader.
5580628	5584629	Wait, F you to that person who caused it by faking their own death to get off the net.
5586129	5586529	Wow.
5586549	5586609	Wow.
5588774	5594178	One more, F you to not being able to DDR more than one game because of not having enough energy even after a full night of sleep.
5594438	5595238	Wait, let me go back to this.
5595578	5604604	Somebody faked their own death on the internet, and then this guy, our guy in the chatroom, Jon Fields, gets blamed as being a cult leader and gets sued for killing that person.
5604844	5607486	Okay, first of all... How the hell did that happen?
5607506	5613269	First of all, the whole faking your whole death thing on the internet, if anyone falls for that bullshit, they're so stupid.
5614230	5614510	You know?
5616219	5621282	I've had people try to pull that stuff and then I just traced their IP and found other places that they're posting.
5625025	5626105	That is so weird.
5626605	5626966	Wow.
5627026	5627946	That's so stupid.
5628286	5631168	As the internet turns, as the world wide web turns.
5632209	5637092	Alright, ViolentHyperGirl would like to give a big FU to AP practice exams and bitchy club advisors.
5637692	5643836	Another FU to the MilpitasGolfLand AZN idiots who think they're good and then run away from the machine when I start freestyling.
5647679	5650099	Moohimer would like to say, fuck stupid friends again.
5650240	5655961	Fuck almost going to Ocean City to play DDR, but then my parents are being like, uh, no, but I'm going Tuesday anyway.
5656201	5656761	You know what's funny?
5656861	5667023	Ocean City is that town, you ever drive through Sacramento and it's like where Highway 50 starts, and they have like, oh, Sacramento's this far away, and Lake Tahoe's this far away, and then Ocean City, Maryland is this far away, because that's where Highway 50 ends.
5667103	5668123	Isn't that funny?
5669643	5670204	I don't know.
5670384	5671164	I thought it was funny, I don't know.
5671284	5672084	Well, Rob!
5672364	5677205	Fuck online games for being so addicting, although I must say, SissyFight.com is strangely fun.
5680014	5680874	I have to visit that site.
5680914	5681874	Fuck bag in the background.
5682195	5682775	Eh, whatever.
5683975	5684975	Hey, I picked that too.
5684995	5688556	DarkTetsuya would like to give an F you to all the spam I've been getting lately.
5689336	5690097	Build a sculpture.
5691177	5693778	Um, that's why you block it.
5693978	5699359	F you to QDChaser's heavy steps on the extreme not matching DDR Max's USAs.
5705077	5710060	Skyline would like to say a big F you to boring eventless spring breaks.
5710200	5711081	Now I'm fat again.
5712242	5713122	Oh, poor baby.
5715084	5717766	Stop watching reality TV and go play some DDR.
5718346	5719927	Fraternity life sucks also.
5719947	5720868	I'd just like you to know.
5721328	5723810	If someone hates reality TV, you're watching an awful lot of it.
5723930	5725090	I was bored yesterday.
5725130	5726151	It was all I was on.
5726191	5728553	I was waiting for a show I'll talk about later.
5729393	5732515	Anyway, Japan Man would like to say fuck me for forgetting the show.
5732596	5733016	That is all.
5733939	5734579	Yeah, fuck you!
5734619	5735159	Yeah, fuck you!
5735359	5736320	No, just kidding, it's cool.
5736460	5736760	It happens.
5736780	5737440	Fuck you, man!
5737520	5739341	I almost forgot the show today.
5739861	5745283	Japan Man would also like to say, Fuck certain people that make fun of me when I fail on Bag, and I'm 50 times better than them.
5746163	5748584	Fuck memories on Naoki Neo Standard.
5748884	5750144	It's a bitch, but I finally beat it.
5750184	5750504	Woo!
5751265	5752225	And, uh, what the fuck?
5752265	5754666	Fuck the test our state makes us take every fucking year.
5754746	5755046	Die.
5756437	5757058	That was so Jimmy.
5758619	5758980	It's alright.
5759320	5763564	Bryce, RYC3, that's why I said it, so Jimmy.
5763704	5772052	RYC3 would like to say, fuck you dumb fucks in SoCal, guys, who have no chance on getting with the girls they want to get with, then later crying over it to me because they got rejected.
5772453	5773333	Fuck you to being single.
5773594	5773854	Amen.
5774234	5778779	Fuck you to kids, preteens at work, testing my patience in the counter, giving prizes for tickets.
5782052	5784993	23rd Magus would like to say, here's my big old list.
5785613	5786353	F you to Kentucky.
5786533	5787833	F you to spending a week in Kentucky.
5788053	5789253	F you to the flight to Kentucky.
5789713	5791694	F you to turbulence on the flight back to Kentucky.
5791914	5794534	F you to having to leech money off mom to buy Angel a ring in Kentucky.
5794574	5795354	Hands Angel a ring.
5795935	5799435	F you to getting mom's IP banned from DJ Bad while I was in Kentucky.
5799895	5801696	F you to missing Orange Lounge while I was in Kentucky.
5802196	5804956	F you to having nothing to do in Kentucky, but pretty much F you to Kentucky.
5806076	5806336	Zing.
5807577	5809297	Yeah, I would have said F you to Kentucky.
5811638	5812999	I want to know if you brought back chicken.
5820223	5825806	MoreThanJake543, F you to boring breaks, false hope, sporks not being made out of metal.
5826166	5826806	That's a good one.
5827887	5832790	People who think punk is fashion, and when you send your F you's to the wrong person.
5834210	5837451	and the fact that I lost my Battle Royale in my hard drive crash of last week.
5837812	5838972	Oh yes, F you to American Idol.
5838992	5840073	I can replace that.
5842674	5844774	You know what, actually, I need to throw in one more fuck you.
5845675	5853578	Fuck you to 800 megabyte, um, uh, BenQ files that I don't have the disks that are capable of burning Battle Royale to right now.
5854399	5854819	Zip them up?
5855019	5855419	Does it work?
5855919	5859521	No, it's the file to burn to BenQ.
5860001	5861742	And I can't copy the file off.
5861942	5862402	That's weird.
5863530	5865992	You know, they do have things to rip being Q files.
5867052	5868073	I'm talking about that.
5868093	5871335	I'm talking about the file itself being too big to burn to a CD.
5874837	5876798	Vid Powwow would like to say, F you to school.
5876938	5878339	I don't want to go back after vacation.
5878699	5881861	And F you to myself for bringing all the things needed to play 2DX at a party.
5881921	5882722	Except the controller!
5884683	5885364	That was funny.
5885384	5885824	Who was that?
5886264	5886764	Vid Powwow.
5888606	5888986	Teehee.
5891671	5897397	ElectroTal, our old friend, that would like to say F you to whoever fucked up Sakpamani.
5898518	5900980	Well, that would be our good friends at $1hosting.com.
5901221	5908147	Yes, fuck them and fuck DuploWeb for going away, and fuck WebCountry, who owns $1hosting.
5908648	5912291	So look for the coming of Sakpamani.org.
5913527	5916808	With a subdomain, cybermoney.org, fuck you.
5917309	5918469	I don't know.
5919109	5921250	Fuck you and bellarhosting.com.
5922191	5922691	Sounds good to me.
5922971	5925192	ViolentHypergold gives one last FU.
5925892	5928714	FU to my stupid computer that likes to reset itself for no apparent reason.
5928774	5930014	It's not even an old computer.
5932415	5934936	And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the one hour long FUs of the week.
5934976	5935697	Congratulations.
5935737	5935977	Yay.
5936097	5936697	Yay.
5939275	5940416	You know why your computer resets?
5940616	5940816	Why?
5941096	5945898	Because probably your fan on your heat sink is dirty and your computer's overheating.
5946938	5947479	Check that.
5950540	5953541	No, seriously, Punk Knight's computer used to do that reset for no reason.
5953561	5958724	We found out that his fan was jammed from moving by a bunch of dust.
5959244	5959644	So, yeah.
5963257	5964618	How about we do the cage match now?
5964958	5966039	The system is down.
5966679	5967780	Let's do the cage match now.
5967860	5968360	That'll be fun.
5968500	5968761	Okay.
5968981	5969801	That'll be a fun one.
5970682	5971282	This'll be fun.
5971442	5975205	And then while we're compiling those, we can do Son of a Bitch after that.
5975225	5978347	Yeah, so I'm giving us time to do listless while the cage match songs are playing.
5978447	5979248	I'll start handing out paper.
5979528	5980348	Sounds like a good idea.
5981129	5983310	Okay, so, hold on, I'm bringing up cage match.
5986974	5988494	Yeah, so hi, how was your week?
5989054	5989935	While I get my music.
5989955	5991075	My week was unemployed.
5991475	5994235	I didn't sleep most of the week.
5994255	5996096	How many fuck-off shows did you do this week?
5996996	5997116	One.
5997456	5997836	Only one?
5998096	5998996	No, I may have done two.
5999216	5999576	Maybe two.
6000097	6003797	I'm going to be doing a fuck-off show, though, on Tuesday night, I'm sure.
6003837	6004017	Cool.
6004657	6004957	Good job.
6006058	6008438	Yeah, that's one reason you've got to listen to Orange Lounge Radio all the time.
6008578	6010038	Our Bumani Music War Program gives the surprises.
6010138	6010619	I've got a tonight.
6014406	6016007	Not bad, not bad.
6016207	6017748	That's more than we get on some of these shows.
6018228	6022610	Yeah, and I had nine listeners at 7 a.m.
6022710	6023011	one day.
6023311	6024932	Which for internet radio is amazingly good.
6024972	6028494	Because I did a fuck-off show from 11.30 p.m.
6028694	6030194	until 8 in the morning.
6032035	6033776	So are we ever going to be featured on Satellite Radio?
6033796	6034577	Yeah, that's what I want to know.
6035559	6037000	I still say we need to get on G4.
6037020	6039101	With some of the crap they have on there, Orange Lounge would fit right in.
6039542	6039802	All right.
6039822	6041603	Cool.
6041703	6044865	Let's go to this week's Cage Max, shall we, ladies and gents?
6044885	6046086	I just called it Cage Max.
6047326	6048367	Max!
6049267	6049728	Help me.
6051329	6053250	Okay, here we go with tonight's Cage Max.
6054668	6056768	Last week... Boys and girls.
6057409	6057749	No.
6059649	6060109	Okay, hi.
6060689	6064890	Last week in the cage match, Loki won it with a song called Duck Toy by Hampenberg.
6064930	6065850	And here is a clip.
6066591	6072192	The way the cage match works, you can vote for either Loki's song, DarkSakura's song, or my song.
6072912	6077293	And the winning song gets to go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.
6077613	6080273	Except Duck Toy never went into rotation because I never got a copy of the MP3.
6080334	6080874	Oops.
6081294	6081554	Oh well.
6082034	6082194	So...
6082794	6084378	Here it is, though, one more time for you.
6084518	6086382	It could still win tonight if you want to vote for it.
6086442	6087985	The first entry in tonight's cage match.
6088005	6089769	Here's a clip of Hamperberg with DuckToy.
6114838	6116086	Thanks for watching!
6163912	6164452	All right.
6164993	6166894	That was Hamperberg with Duck Toy.
6167454	6169975	That was last week's winner in Orange Lounge Radio's cage match.
6169995	6170676	You can vote for that.
6170696	6171376	That's the first song.
6172049	6173850	or you can vote for my pick this week.
6174870	6182173	I promised Irene like four weeks ago I'd do this song and I didn't because I kept finding better stuff like Freeze Pop.
6184294	6187615	You know what?
6187715	6189035	I'll put in Super Spro tonight.
6189135	6189476	I will.
6189876	6190416	Don't push me.
6190896	6191156	All right.
6193437	6194998	No, I want to do a different artist tonight.
6195018	6198039	You should at least be happy you won that game.
6198059	6198939	Yeah, that was funny.
6198999	6201220	It was only because we got into a fight on air, but that was cool.
6201941	6210264	Anyway, okay, my pick tonight is actually a band I put in the cage match like way, like probably the first or second cage match I put this band in, and they lost.
6211004	6212485	But that's okay because they're going to win tonight, right?
6213720	6217744	This band is called Olive, and they're a cool little trip-hop band from a few years ago.
6217804	6218725	They were big a couple years ago.
6218745	6219585	I don't know if they're still around.
6219605	6220366	Are they still around, Irene?
6220386	6221527	You're the one that made me put this song in.
6224550	6226111	All right, whatever.
6226432	6229975	Actually, no, I think they do still do stuff recently, because I think this song was on the Next Best Thing soundtrack.
6229995	6230696	That's where it came from.
6230756	6236521	This song is called, it's a cover of an old 70s song, and it's called I'm Not In Love.
6236901	6237622	So enjoy.
6237642	6238403	This song is cool.
6248448	6256913	I'm not in love, so don't forget it It's just a silly thing I'm going through
6278581	6279566	and just because
6407375	6408379	Thanks for watching!
6506252	6506752	Oopies!
6506892	6507293	Oopies!
6507833	6509013	I ended that one a little soon.
6509053	6509414	That's alright.
6509434	6509854	That was the end.
6509874	6510834	Those last ten seconds of it.
6511194	6517518	That was Olive with I'm... That was Olive with I'm Not In Love.
6518158	6519479	What did you kids think of that one?
6524101	6526202	I wasn't really listening.
6526812	6539676	I'm not in love I'm not in love with that song You're so punny No, I'm really not, that was the worst song ever That was almost as bad as Freeze Pod
6556932	6559093	I give it a two, because it sucks.
6559173	6559673	You bitch.
6560133	6560833	It sucks!
6560853	6562754	You're never going to like a song I put in Cage Match.
6562954	6563474	You could die.
6563634	6565214	Yeah, but I won one for you, didn't I?
6565854	6566234	Whatever.
6566755	6567415	Okay, fine.
6567795	6569095	You didn't win that week either.
6569395	6572876	You lost, if it wasn't for me and Tile fighting.
6573536	6574037	You suck.
6574617	6575377	Tim, what did you think?
6577417	6578278	One to ten scale.
6581739	6582559	I don't like it that much.
6584178	6584878	What do you give it?
6585199	6585899	On a 1 to a 10.
6588321	6589121	Will you stop that?
6589581	6589922	Stop it!
6592263	6593204	I will decide my own.
6594024	6598847	I will give it a... It's a decent song, actually.
6599908	6603991	Some might actually pick, but I have to say I'd give it probably a 4.
6604951	6605211	4 or 5.
6606012	6606472	Wonderful.
6606772	6607773	Irene, what did you think?
6608613	6609934	Well, I know who picked it, so...
6617686	6621128	I give it a 9.9 because it's sexy but not as sexy as me.
6621148	6627051	Do you know who I am?
6627991	6636556	Sorry, I should have said not as sexy as Dr. J. Alright, one more pick for this week's cage match and it comes from Miss Dark Sakura.
6636576	6636916	What is it?
6637498	6642922	This was a song that I, I don't, I was like, oh my god, I need a song, I'll pick this one.
6644283	6645104	But I really like it.
6645984	6646465	What's it called?
6647646	6649967	Phantom of the Opera something or the other remix, I don't know.
6650348	6653110	Alright, this is a Phantom of the Opera something or other remix, enjoy.
6906198	6907079	Hi, we're back.
6908080	6912084	That was the Phantom of the Opera techno remix.
6912584	6913886	Going around the room, what did you think, Jamie?
6914437	6919119	Well, I could have found better if I had tried, so I give it an eight and a half.
6920299	6920840	Zero?
6922180	6927422	Okay, I absolutely love the finale of the opera, but I really like the original a lot more than that.
6928143	6935666	And so, even though it was a good remix, uh, technomics of it, I'll give it, like, an eight, because it was still pretty decent, even though it could have been better.
6937301	6940723	Thank you, what'd you think?
6963762	6968586	Uh, I heard this a long ass time ago, way before I started doing this show.
6969206	6970227	That's how old it is.
6970527	6971207	Oh, food!
6971648	6972548	You went to McDonald's instead?
6972568	6973529	Keep going, keep going, keep going.
6975030	6975971	Oh, I don't give a shit.
6976271	6979333	If you got me the two cheeseburger meal with super size, I love you.
6982071	6984872	I give it an 8, but vote for my song.
7012092	7015633	Um, I thought it was, it was pretty decent.
7015873	7017614	It was, it was a decent mix.
7018234	7019955	Um, I'll give it, uh, 8.
7020075	7021535	I can totally see that mix in DDR.
7021976	7026297	Okay, so, really quick, you guys, here's clips of the three songs you can vote for tonight.
7026537	7029418	First one, last week's winner, Hamperberg with Duck Toy.
7036951	7037972	Don't vote for that one.
7038212	7039514	Vote for someone else's.
7039674	7040475	Vote for Rob's.
7040595	7042297	You can vote for Olive with I'm Not In Love.
7051048	7053812	Or you can vote for Phantom of the Opera, The Technomix.
7066121	7066921	Thank you for watching!
7087762	7088943	You've won, like, what, one?
7089164	7089464	Yeah.
7089864	7091086	You can vote for me as a pity.
7091106	7092007	You deserve to win one.
7092187	7094249	All votes for DuckToy go to Rob.
7095030	7096312	Because I don't want that song to win.
7096732	7097073	Alright.
7097954	7104421	Usually we don't go to a musical break right after Cage Match, but there's a little chaotic because we just had food brought into the room, so people are scrounging for food.
7104441	7106123	So we're going to take a quickie, quickie break.
7106663	7107824	and we will be right back.
7108205	7110227	And we're going to have tonight's list list when we get back.
7110747	7120896	So, we're going to go to a song that I think Jamie likes a lot this week because you had a good accomplishment with this song this week.
7121717	7123479	Okay, we're going to hear the long version of Last Message.
7124780	7126842	I want the breasts to come... Oh, sorry.
7126982	7127062	Pfft.
7175412	7177877	Thank you for watching!
7206351	7207296	Thanks for watching!
7322143	7330909	I'm singing all you love No matter where you may be My thoughts will travel to you Cause I need my message
7345302	7346343	Thank you for watching!
7381514	7385675	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
7385895	7387616	Do you want to be accepted by Hollywood?
7387656	7387996	No!
7388156	7391797	Do we care what people think of us?
7392397	7394257	No!
7394277	7395698	Do we want people to kiss our ass?
7396198	7398438	Yes!
7400259	7402119	Extreme Bomani Radio.
7402339	7405060	That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
7405971	7411555	We are back, ladies and gentlemen, and I have tonight's winner of the cage match.
7413437	7421202	And by an amazing one vote, one vote margin, made this song win.
7421803	7428187	Tonight's cage match winner is... DuckToy!
7428207	7428608	DuckToy!
7430124	7430804	Why?
7430984	7432485	I tell you not to and you do.
7432745	7433485	You bastards.
7433865	7434205	That's it.
7434225	7435746	You're on the list.
7436946	7439207	By one vote over Phantom of the Opera.
7439587	7440307	One vote.
7440387	7444688	Doesn't that mean... If the one person who voted for Olive would have voted the other way around.
7446649	7448369	Only one person voted for Olive.
7448569	7450009	Do not speak of the English.
7450089	7451710	I said don't vote for the damn song.
7452841	7454262	Because I have something better next week.
7454382	7460968	Which is funny because I could swear that the one person who voted for my song was also the one person who was hating on it in the chat room.
7461849	7462530	Rob wins.
7465257	7468179	So, Loki, congratulations, you win once again.
7468339	7473283	However, I guess since Jamie did this a few weeks back, we will extend the same offer to you.
7474043	7478066	You can pull the song Voluntary out next week and put in your own new song.
7478086	7479928	Because we let Jamie do that with the Zelda thing, right?
7480008	7480188	Yeah.
7480528	7481709	So, only to be fair.
7481749	7488294	Now, I have, this is my new project thing I want to, I say us as Americans should push this.
7488954	7492497	Get rid of reality TV and instead put Japanese game shows.
7492517	7493057	Yeah!
7493590	7493910	Why?
7494370	7494651	Why?
7495071	7497712	The greatest thing has happened yesterday, okay?
7498172	7500194	TNN has brought this new show.
7500234	7504196	Well, it's kind of an old Japanese TV show where they basically torture these people.
7504796	7507617	Anyways, and they make them do ridiculous challenges.
7507697	7510279	And the show's called Most Extreme Elimination Challenge.
7510859	7512360	It's the greatest show ever and...
7512901	7518783	Because it's all in Japanese, they have these people dubbing over the voices and making them sound really goofy and stupid.
7519223	7520263	And it's that much better.
7521124	7522684	It is the greatest show on Earth.
7524084	7525585	It would beat out any reality show.
7525685	7526205	Fuck that.
7526505	7528126	This is the best shit ever, okay?
7529446	7535008	This is the best fucking... This is what game shows should aspire to be, okay?
7535448	7541090	I mean, Price is Right is good, but nowhere... It does not come anywhere near this damn show.
7541330	7542050	Best show ever.
7543372	7549806	Speaking of reality shows, did you see any previews lately for that new Spring Break reality movie that's coming out?
7552170	7553391	I already fucking talked about that!
7553751	7557474	Okay, that fucking black guy in his fucking Speedo, he can die.
7558014	7559335	Yeah, this is a great idea.
7559576	7565160	Let's take non-actors, give them no script, and just have them go wild on Spring Break.
7565380	7566881	And we'll film it and call it a movie.
7567101	7567501	Fuck that.
7567842	7569323	I can go around yelling at people.
7569343	7570223	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
7570564	7573346	Speaking of reality TV, I watched something that Islander had.
7574375	7575695	The Blind Date DVD.
7576256	7578036	The Uncensored Blind Date DVD.
7582178	7584659	Well, this one was great.
7585619	7595322	I mean, besides, though, all the boobs and cock there was all over the place, they showed this one person who, like, by the end of the day, they were, like, already all over each other the whole date.
7595342	7595802	It was funny.
7595842	7597283	Like, they just met the first day.
7597503	7600044	Yeah, she, without her, she unbuttoned her sweater.
7601965	7603045	It was, it was just, like...
7604204	7605604	I was like, these are your first dates.
7605624	7606805	What's wrong with you stupid people?
7607925	7611386	By the way, boys and girls, Orange Lounge, the motion picture, comes out at the end of the year.
7611406	7612467	No, it doesn't.
7614407	7616048	And that's all it is, is a moving picture.
7616068	7617728	Yeah, it comes out and then it goes back in.
7618388	7623550	Stupid MTV with their stupid reality shows.
7623750	7626531	Fraternity Life and Sorority Life are being filmed at the same time.
7627731	7632593	One falls, obviously, the sorority, and the other one the fraternity, and their rival fraternity, sorority things.
7633479	7634020	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7644997	7646078	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7665936	7667817	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7697515	7699577	I asked for a big and tasty with no meat.
7699997	7701339	I asked for a big and tasty with no meat.
7701379	7705462	I got a piece of bread, some onions, and a tomato.
7707885	7708385	Beautiful.
7709606	7710047	You know why?
7710427	7712209	You need to go to BK because they have the veggie burger there.
7712429	7713129	It's pretty decent.
7713570	7713990	Pretty decent.
7714671	7715752	We need to do listless.
7715872	7717033	Yes, we do need to do listless.
7717073	7719756	There was one other thing I was thinking of that I wanted to bring up before.
7719816	7721117	But you forgot, so let's do listless.
7721217	7721577	All right.
7722038	7723239	But I forgot, so let's do listless.
7724924	7725304	I'm a scat man!
7751904	7756928	It is time, once again, for Orange Lounge Radio's Listless!
7759810	7760131	Alright.
7763673	7767196	It's, um... Listless.
7767556	7767717	Yes.
7768057	7771500	It's inspired by an old television show that used to be on VH1.
7771920	7773961	Not stolen from, but inspired by.
7775783	7776083	Alright.
7776343	7777024	Tonight's topic...
7780367	7782168	Jamie is here to explain tonight's topic.
7782649	7783029	I am?
7783369	7783490	Oh.
7783670	7783910	Yes.
7784791	7786212	Tonight's topic is Chicken McNugget.
7787993	7788153	No.
7789955	7791956	This, again, is back on the Kingdom Hearts theme.
7793117	7799763	It is what world is associated with Disney, Miramax, Enix, or Square?
7799983	7800343	ABC.
7800844	7801164	Enix.
7802525	7802845	Enix.
7804507	7805047	Squeenix.
7805908	7806649	Squeenix, yes.
7806709	7807209	Squeenix.
7808914	7810035	or for Loki, Squamous.
7812818	7814879	Would you like to see in the next Kingdom Hearts game?
7815280	7818162	All right, so what world would you like to... Oh, I'm sorry.
7820625	7822526	What world would you like to see in the new Kingdom Hearts game?
7822566	7822767	All right.
7836932	7837532	Alright, here we go.
7837572	7838052	Who's starting?
7838552	7839473	Wait, who's participating?
7839513	7840213	Show of hands.
7841453	7842273	This whole thing?
7842493	7843513	You guys are at McDonald's, sorry.
7843554	7844534	Okay, Jamie's first.
7844854	7845374	Yes, Jamie.
7845434	7848935	My number three would be Chrono Trigger slash Chrono Cross.
7855156	7857657	Alright, so Jamie says Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross.
7857677	7858657	Any particular reason?
7859657	7861297	You want to say any of the reasons why?
7862058	7863338	First of all, I think Michelle would kill me.
7865615	7868877	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7895069	7896710	It would be funny to see Chasing Daisy.
7897530	7898810	Chasing Daisy?
7902292	7906053	I know, but if you wanted to mix it, it would be Chasing Amy, but you just call it Chasing Daisy.
7906313	7909575	Any particular reason why we want this Chasing Amy slash Chasing Daisy thing?
7909595	7913556	It would be funny to see Mickey, Donald, and Goofy going after a lesbian.
7914117	7915517	You just want Daisy Duck to be a dyke.
7916437	7917458	Because she'll want Middy.
7919372	7920413	Dude, this burger's rare.
7920653	7921253	What's a Nubian?
7922013	7922333	Look at this.
7922654	7923674	The burger is pink.
7923694	7924434	Shut the fuck up.
7925035	7925935	The burger's raw.
7926155	7927496	I'm going to eat it and get poisoned.
7929297	7931397	Is Jim... What was your online name again?
7931437	7931798	I'm sorry.
7932838	7933198	Geist.
7933258	7934199	That's not my online name.
7934259	7935339	It's just kind of a handle of mine.
7935799	7936040	Geist.
7936160	7938581	Okay, Geist.
7938741	7939521	Kind of serious.
7940782	7943563	In the style of Final Fighting Fantasy, actually.
7946267	7947008	Any Final Fantasy?
7947108	7949529	No, Final Fighting Fantasy, Final Flash.
7949769	7950249	Ah, okay.
7950429	7950629	Yeah.
7954771	7955992	Final Fighting Fantasy.
7957173	7966357	For those of you who don't know what Final Fighting Fantasy is, it's basically just a combination of all the Final Fantasy worlds with basically all the storylines intact, like...
7967097	7972119	Whatever characters died in the games are still dead and various other things like that.
7972479	7978342	First of all, they already have 7 and 8 and 10 involved in Kingdom Hearts already.
7979162	7980302	Well, you can combine the others.
7982683	7985524	No, but we're actually picking established individual worlds.
7986145	7990667	Well, basically involving 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 as well.
7992087	7993548	Well, that's the thing with this thing.
7993588	7996749	It's like a saga created to combine all those worlds into one.
7999557	7999737	Huh?
8000978	8004599	Well, it's based off of square characters, though.
8005760	8006040	Alright.
8007921	8009262	Final Fighting Fantasy.
8010102	8010362	Alright.
8013164	8015465	Alright, for those who may not have heard of it, there's your explanation.
8015925	8016425	Let's go on.
8016665	8018046	Loki, your number three pick.
8019286	8037633	I'm gonna rain on someone's parade here, but Xenogears or Xenosaga Xenogears or Xenosaga, you gotta pick one Xenogears is fucking, well Xenogears is only, same fucking universe Alright, alright Any other particular reason why?
8040359	8041879	Because that game rocks.
8041959	8045640	It has giant robots to smash down Mickey because he sucks and he's gay.
8046781	8047421	All right, Irene.
8047861	8048441	Your pick.
8048941	8052722	Well, I'm incorporating both Anita and Jason's picks.
8052882	8055043	So our number three is Star Ocean.
8055403	8056343	Star Ocean.
8056483	8056723	Yeah.
8056843	8058764	I've never played it, but they said it, so I don't know.
8063528	8063929	All right.
8065010	8071015	Since we can pick anything, you know, Miramax, any of that, because they all are owned by the same group, my number three was Pulp Fiction Land.
8071035	8071475	Yeah.
8073297	8075979	That would be funny.
8076680	8077441	Here's the Keyblade.
8077781	8078742	I had it up my ass.
8081584	8082545	Give me back my Keyblade.
8082605	8083266	Which Keyblade is it?
8083306	8084627	It's the one that says Bam-a-da-fuck-a on it.
8086969	8090172	Lord will strike down upon thee with great vengeance.
8090232	8090472	All right.
8091092	8092272	They'll call the Keyblade here.
8092292	8092952	You know what they call it?
8095393	8095693	Alright.
8095713	8096673	Lead Blade Royale.
8098133	8098654	With cheese.
8098854	8099874	Lead Battle Royale.
8100314	8101274	Lead Battle Royale.
8102674	8103055	Yes.
8103135	8104075	Jamie, your number two pick?
8104755	8107195	My number two pick is Bustin' Move and Bustin' 2.
8108976	8110736	Because I want heat in my party.
8112476	8113137	To dance.
8113997	8114917	And set people on fire.
8115882	8130491	Alright, so you want Busta Moves so you can have heat lay down the law And no I'm not talking about Puzzle Bobble And the name Busta Groove is not really a name It's what the 989 Studios has duped you into thinking it is
8131658	8131958	All right.
8134140	8135261	Zero, your number two pick.
8135721	8143886	I think it would be cool to see the Final Fantasy... I mean, all the characters from Kingdom Hearts, like, have, like, an air guys type fighting game.
8144207	8145408	Ooh, so air guys.
8149771	8151792	I have no idea if I spelled that right, but I think I'm close.
8154314	8154794	Close enough.
8157096	8157376	Yes.
8157396	8157476	Yes.
8161272	8162433	All right, Jim.
8163134	8163814	Your number two pick.
8165096	8169279	My number two pick would have to be the best thing to come out of Disney, Gargoyles.
8169840	8170821	Gargoyles.
8170961	8171522	Very good.
8171562	8171922	All right.
8176646	8178208	I remember the old Gargoyles Quest games.
8178268	8179949	Actually, I don't think they had anything.
8179989	8181451	Did they have anything to do with the series?
8181671	8182692	No, they weren't related, were they?
8183567	8185289	All right, Gargoyles, that's a good one, all right.
8186229	8187390	Loki, your number two pick.
8187490	8189792	The best fucking game for Squaresoft.
8190033	8193376	Well, yeah, what you, the artist formerly known as Squaresoft.
8195157	8199421	Ergotts, or not Ergotts, ah, fuck, ah, no, wrong game, wrong game.
8199741	8201062	It gives it an E though, Einhander.
8202624	8203364	What one, what one?
8203624	8204305	Einhander.
8204926	8205466	Einhunter?
8205886	8208769	Einhander, meaning one-hander.
8209990	8211131	H-A-N-D-E-R.
8212964	8213344	It's a shitty game.
8213364	8213764	It's a shooter.
8214824	8215825	Alright, it's an old shooter.
8215845	8216985	We'll play Einhunder.
8219286	8219546	Alright.
8221006	8221666	Hmm, okay.
8222467	8224927	Irene, your number two pick from the little group over there?
8225327	8231509	I don't even think this is like related to Square or Disney or Miramax or anything, but...
8234537	8235658	I put Reading Rainbow.
8235998	8237580	Because I love that show so much.
8237660	8238701	Reading Rainbow.
8238801	8239201	Yeah.
8239641	8242304	So, Reading Rainbow World would be so awesome.
8243765	8246107	Well, yeah, Reading Rainbow is done by LeVar Burton, right?
8246147	8247188	Yes, with LeVar Burton.
8247388	8250631	And LeVar Burton is on Star Trek The Next Generation.
8250651	8254034	Star Trek The Next Generation was sponsored by... Give me help, sir.
8255095	8255976	Okay, I'm trying to...
8258978	8260699	Would he join your party at that point?
8260919	8261899	2 plus 2 is 4.
8261939	8262699	4 times 3 is 12.
8262739	8264019	There are 12 inches in a ruler.
8264039	8265840	Queen Elizabeth was a ruler and so on and so forth.
8268020	8269821	Yeah, anyway, so vote for Reading Rainbow.
8275002	8275702	Reading Rainbow.
8275742	8276783	I used to have the theme song.
8276803	8277723	I can't find it anymore.
8277763	8278123	Oh, well.
8279103	8280684	Butterfly in the sky.
8284324	8285085	Dark Oh yeah?
8285565	8285885	F you
8314358	8315359	Alright, my number one.
8317000	8318081	Yes, your number one, Jamie.
8318862	8323286	Because Disney now owns the rights to the dubbed version of Digimon.
8323926	8324847	So that's my pick.
8325327	8326208	Digimon.
8326228	8327569	Because Pokemon sucks ass.
8327850	8329251	Hey, I just saw Pokemon 4 this week.
8329731	8330272	It was cool.
8330612	8330912	Nerd.
8331453	8332534	And Pokemon 5 is coming out soon.
8332574	8336317	Okay, first of all, if you watch Digimon in Japanese, it doesn't suck.
8336917	8338499	I do agree the dubbed is sort of ass.
8344179	8345140	Zero, your number one pick.
8346180	8355546	Okay, I had a tough time choosing between, but since, you know, Disney owns ABC, because, you know, they're trying to be the Microsoft of television now, I had to choose.
8355626	8357887	It would either be the Drew Carey show or Whose Line Is It Anyway?
8358067	8359328	Because that would be hella funny.
8359808	8360629	That would be funny.
8360649	8362890	You have to, like, improv to make everyone laugh.
8364931	8365832	Is that your number one pick?
8366692	8367893	Son of a bitch, you took mine.
8372131	8377474	I just want to say for those who had their picks taken by somebody else, great minds think alike.
8379154	8379995	I'm not getting you in the mic.
8380015	8380955	Can you make sure it's on over there?
8381996	8382216	Hello?
8382376	8382816	Oh, there we go.
8382836	8383296	Okay, it's back.
8383336	8383656	Whatever.
8383676	8384277	That was weird.
8385977	8397923	My number one pick would have to be excluding those underdeveloped characters, unless there are some pedophiles in the audience, would have to be a Final Fantasy nudist colony.
8400490	8402592	A Final Fantasy nudist colony.
8403492	8404493	It's something anybody can like.
8407335	8409057	Well, we had to get porn in the show somehow.
8410818	8411218	Alright.
8412739	8413380	Number one.
8414301	8414721	Alright.
8415562	8417463	Number one from Loki.
8418104	8418384	Okay.
8418784	8419585	Wait a second.
8419865	8420145	Okay.
8421006	8428952	It's gonna be... Um... Horrible theme park ride turned into movieville.
8434006	8441792	Horrible theme park attraction turned into movieville because Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion, The Country Bears.
8442132	8444994	That has nothing to do with the subject of the cage match.
8445555	8446055	Sure it does.
8446355	8450198	Pirates of the Caribbean is being made of, you know, you gotta pick one.
8450218	8451359	So we're Pirates of the Caribbean?
8451999	8454001	Fine, I'll pick a goddamn universe then.
8454321	8456743	Alright, you know, let's see here, um...
8457369	8458730	Let me pull one out of my ass here.
8459951	8461652	We're going to pick... Country Bears?
8462613	8462913	No!
8463534	8466937	They're going to go to... I don't know, let's see.
8467037	8468338	How about Halloweenville?
8468378	8472221	Because, you know, the Halloween... Halloweenville's in the game, and Kingdom Hearts 1.
8473142	8474883	Halloween the fucking movieville!
8474943	8475924	God damn it, you know?
8476344	8478166	Alright, alright, alright.
8478246	8482289	Yeah, it is Miramax.
8483638	8484179	Okay, if you would.
8484199	8484819	Oh, I'd go there.
8485540	8485920	Alright.
8487141	8492206	This is D-Child, and since I'm not part of this list list, I'm just throwing one out there because I have to get this out.
8492326	8492646	Alright.
8493106	8499492	Because Kevin Smith was a whore for Miramax, I'd have to say The Quick Stop, along with James Allen Bob.
8499973	8500893	You must have them.
8502395	8504016	Yeah, I was going to say they already have...
8507685	8508565	All right, the quick stop.
8508686	8510046	All right, Irene, what's your guys' number one?
8510266	8512427	Okay, this is at Anita's suggestion.
8512788	8513328	Is it on?
8513888	8514809	Yeah, okay.
8515269	8518890	She suggested Spirited Awayville or town or something.
8520271	8522372	Because, yes, because I love Spirited Away.
8522812	8523373	That's a good one.
8523433	8524493	Spirited Away was a great film.
8524533	8526234	So, Spirited Awayland or whatever.
8526934	8529236	My number one was Whose Line Is It Anyway, but it got taken.
8529536	8529916	Bastard.
8530948	8531789	So I'm going to change.
8531829	8538295	I'm going to do a ride as well because the whole discussion about the ride got me thinking and I would love to see a spinning teacups land.
8545581	8548444	Where you just spin round and round and you're in a giant teacup.
8550166	8554309	Yeah, and then everybody vomits all over and it's just a big green pile of shit.
8554670	8556972	You should do the faulty gondola ride, Phil.
8559409	8564572	Alright, now's the part where we have to say goodbye to something that's on the list.
8565032	8565872	Here we go, Jamie.
8566132	8572015	There's a lot of these that I would take off the list because they have absolutely nothing to do with the subject of the list list, however.
8572356	8575457	Yeah, someone said Ergus.
8575537	8577118	And it's its own universe.
8578317	8578817	Alright, alright.
8579058	8585862	So, I'm going to take off Final Fighting Fantasy because that's involving multiple universes, so it's trying to combine multiple things in one, so it's cheating.
8586683	8588143	Alright, so Final Fighting Fantasy.
8588724	8589124	Alright, stop.
8589164	8592486	If it was Final Fantasy VI or Final Fantasy V, I would have agreed with it.
8592586	8595228	However, that's sort of cheating to take multiple answers in one.
8596249	8597490	Alright, so on to technicality.
8597530	8597910	There it goes.
8598070	8598830	Alright, zero.
8599051	8601032	She's going to end up punching someone over or something.
8601570	8604892	No, I would take out probably the Final Fantasy Nudist Colony.
8605012	8608214	Because I don't think it would be... You could, like, look on the internet for that.
8608595	8609996	You could look on the internet for that!
8610416	8612417	Alright, get on the internet if you want to see some nudity.
8612437	8614819	Because we know Cloud's in the gay porn, so, uh, yeah.
8615079	8618121	Alright, I don't know if you can see the list all the way back there, Jim, but is there something on here?
8618161	8618661	It's gotta go.
8618681	8626487	Uh... That's called We The Losers, isn't it?
8635017	8640261	I'm sorry, since I wasn't that big of a fan of it, I'd have to say Romy and Michelle, though.
8640281	8641161	Aw, make me cry.
8641521	8645344	Do-do-do-do, this is the dial tone, do-do-do.
8646505	8647006	Loki.
8649748	8652710	Uh, we're gonna take off, um...
8654218	8655238	Chasing Daisy.
8655618	8656799	Chasing Daisy.
8657679	8659439	You do have the quick stops a little better.
8659459	8660839	Yeah, quick stops a little better.
8661380	8662700	Alright, I agree.
8663380	8664300	Irene, what's coming down?
8673002	8676543	I think I'm going to take off the spinning teacups.
8678731	8679332	You suck.
8680812	8682072	All my pics are going.
8682573	8683273	Makes me sad.
8683873	8685613	Alright, then that leaves me.
8689674	8700617	As tempting as I am to take off Chrono Trigger, because everybody knows I think it's overrated, but no, I'm going to keep it on there because I'd get killed by so many people if I did take that off.
8701098	8705839	So... I don't know.
8705859	8706299	Um...
8707952	8713016	I guess I have to take off Halloween, Michael Myers, because it's just... They already did the Nightmare Before Christmas land.
8713716	8725245	Hellraiser versus... Hellraiser I would have let you keep, but... Alright, so now you can vote for one of these lands that should be in the next Kingdom Hearts game.
8725386	8728728	So here they are, they're in the chatroom, and Jamie's going to read them off for you.
8728948	8736094	We have Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, we have Xenogears, Xenosaga, Star Ocean, Pulp Fiction Land...
8737193	8748639	Bust and Move World, Air Guys, Gargoyles, Einhander, Reading Rainbow, Digimon, Whose Line Is It Anyway, Quick Stop, and Spirited Away.
8749339	8749659	Vote!
8750760	8754821	You can send those votes right now over a private message to me, Sky, in the chat room.
8761207	8764390	Alright, while you guys vote, we're going to take a quick break.
8764970	8768973	And we're going to come back and just talk about... Are you ready to do a game review this week?
8771335	8773777	Alright, then Zero's game review when we come back.
8773817	8774358	That'll be fun.
8778541	8783485	Okay, so we're going to listen to some more 2DX fun stuff music.
8784886	8787929	And we'll be right back with Zero and Dark Child's game review.
8788149	8788549	Yay!
8789010	8789990	Alright, we'll be back.
8809042	8810980	Maybe don't you cry
8835973	8837655	What is this thing?
8837715	8839357	What is this thing?
8839397	8841219	What is this thing inside?
8841319	8842781	What is this thing?
8842801	8843802	What is this thing?
8844402	8846204	I thought that you were mine
8925776	8926537	Thanks for watching!
8956998	8958338	Thank you for watching!
9115171	9123716	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.
9123756	9129559	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
9129859	9134041	Well, you're just going to take a left at the Shell Station, and then you're going to go about a mile, anyway.
9134621	9135102	You're listening...
9135982	9142903	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and I bet you all want to know who won the list-less segment.
9143923	9144824	So, here we go.
9145604	9156126	The winning lands that we are going to see in Kingdom Hearts 2, if we had our way, would be, in third place, drumroll, Digimon!
9156526	9158046	Digimon Land, Digimon World.
9158066	9162007	I forgot to be specific that I was referring to Zero Two, because anything after that kind of sucks.
9162687	9163907	So, Digimon Zero Two Land.
9164407	9164647	Alright.
9166860	9171844	Number two, drumroll, is Spirited Away.
9172564	9173645	Good pick, good pick.
9173665	9174366	I like that one a lot.
9175346	9188696	Alright, and in first place, Breath of Anticipation is Gargoyles is the winner for the land you'd most like to see in Kingdom Hearts 2.
9192707	9193328	Thank God.
9194469	9196490	Which kind of Chippendales are you talking about, Loki?
9196550	9197471	Rangers, man.
9197551	9199253	Rescue Rangers.
9199433	9200654	My runner-up, though, was Duckburg.
9201374	9202355	Oh, from DuckTales?
9202615	9203996	DuckTales and Darkwing Duck.
9204757	9207279	What about freaking, um, no, Doug?
9207739	9208220	Hello?
9208620	9209441	No one said Doug?
9210882	9212023	Patty Manning!
9214098	9215238	Mozzarella has a good point.
9215458	9218200	Chip and Dale were in Kingdom Hearts 1, just not their little land.
9218440	9221142	But they were the guys on the ship, right?
9221182	9222422	Yeah, they sent out the ship.
9223183	9225965	You only saw them for like two seconds, and that was their shot.
9226565	9226945	All right.
9227686	9230987	I want to know, if it was the gummy ship, why were there no gummy bears?
9232028	9233269	Dude, that would have been cool, too.
9234069	9235410	It's a gummy bear universe.
9236531	9240073	Yeah, the gummy... Well, you were on the gummy ship, though, so you kind of had it.
9240093	9240273	It was.
9242267	9243028	Crapyship!
9243468	9245530	It was the... Hi, we're really jealous.
9245550	9248512	We have Starfox envy, so we're going to pretend to be Starfox, but not.
9249013	9250033	We suck.
9250053	9251335	So you want to have the gummy forest.
9251355	9252335	Damn you, Squeenix.
9253016	9258540	You hoped in grade for the, um, to get the damn warp drive so you didn't have to go through shooting every fucking thing.
9258761	9261263	Okay, I'm not even there yet, because I loaned you my game.
9262464	9264065	What, you mean when you travel between worlds?
9264625	9265887	I'm like right before Agrabah.
9267208	9267448	Oops.
9268755	9269375	I just beat it.
9269515	9270415	But you get the warp drive.
9270435	9271216	Give me my game back.
9272336	9273476	I want to beat the Hades Cup.
9274676	9275376	Okay, thank you.
9275976	9276817	Alright, moving on.
9277297	9278617	We're going to get to a new segment.
9278677	9280057	Brand new segment tonight.
9280117	9280617	Yay.
9281198	9282538	Brand new segment of Orange Launch Radio.
9282558	9288039	This is where some of our new regulars get to shine.
9288499	9289179	Oh my god.
9290379	9292060	It's the orgasm segment, everybody.
9292460	9293600	Holy shit.
9294200	9295660	Big orgasm, everybody.
9296521	9298261	This is the best thing in the world.
9299810	9302234	Zero and Dark Child's Video Game Reveal
9313909	9317352	Holy shit, and this is a good song to choose.
9317752	9323777	Zero and Dark Child's game review here on Orange Lounge Radio.
9325759	9328241	I think Hitmania would have just been good by itself.
9328381	9330583	No, I just busted at not seeing that manga.
9331443	9333085	And I haven't even seen the picture inside.
9333976	9338242	Alright, Jamie's showing us Battle Royale manga right now.
9339523	9343168	I'm about to take that book and drop my pants in the bathroom, okay?
9344150	9346132	Dude, I'm about to drop my pants right now.
9346332	9346953	I would Abe away.
9350895	9353656	Anyways, back to video games.
9355096	9358778	Okay, I decided to make this one not as extensive as last time.
9358858	9361058	It's just going to be a couple random games that we play throughout the week.
9362139	9368701	Number one is starting off with Midnight Club 2, which, if you haven't played it and you have a PS2, go out and rent it, or... Buy it.
9368981	9369241	Buy it.
9369321	9369822	Don't rent it.
9369962	9370302	Buy it.
9370885	9371746	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9398178	9400059	Really, you gotta, it's definitely worth it.
9400179	9403581	The only thing I wish they could have done in that game was get licensed cars.
9404241	9406762	It's like the cars are exactly like realistic.
9407062	9409924	Yeah, I know, I'm driving a Honda Civic hatchback.
9409944	9412065	Yeah, and it's called like a crapper rapper.
9412105	9413445	Yeah, like a monstro.
9413846	9415646	Yeah, you start off with an S-Corp.
9416127	9417847	Yeah, an S-Corp, what did they call that?
9418228	9419928	Something SI is what they called that.
9419948	9424671	Yeah, but it was pretty, the game is good, the graphics are fluid, the music is actually really decent.
9425291	9427193	It has some pretty good tracks running through the background.
9427353	9430236	I'm not familiar with artists, but you probably know more than I do.
9431057	9433058	There's no one in particular that we really know.
9433078	9435341	It looks like a lot of their own in-house people.
9435901	9447332	One good thing about this game also is that, which is something they should have done with the first one, is there's a lot of shortcuts you can take to win races faster or hit checkpoints in different orders and stuff like that.
9448069	9450011	and the game is fucking hard.
9450371	9457359	You win the first couple races pretty easy and then all of a sudden it jumps up and you have to really race them perfectly.
9457539	9461683	You want to talk about a hard race, just drive the motorcycle.
9462344	9463805	Oh shit, drive the motorcycle anywhere.
9464186	9469091	Motorcycle, I thought it was cool because you actually had to lean, shift your weight in order to turn a motorcycle.
9469751	9474993	So definitely this is a game to buy or rent depending on how big of a racing fan you are.
9475113	9477593	If you're kind of racy, just thinking about it, rent it.
9477974	9484415	And if you don't have a PS2 and you have an Xbox, which I don't know why the fuck you'd have an Xbox, maybe just throw it kids or something.
9485936	9487496	Fucking, hey, fuck Halo.
9487756	9490177	Yeah, I'm gonna go hit everybody on what goddamn game.
9490197	9491157	Halo sucks ass.
9494392	9495454	Oh, Steel Battalion.
9495754	9496315	Steel Battalion, yeah.
9496335	9501100	Okay, if you're buying Xbox just for Steel Battalion, that's $500 down the shitter, alright?
9501921	9505466	I'll tell you what, though, that Steel Battalion controller makes your dick feel twice as big.
9506207	9507849	Especially when it's sitting right on top of it.
9507869	9508109	Twice as big?
9508169	9512554	Anyways, um, but yeah, if you have an Xbox, you can wait.
9512654	9513615	I believe it's till...
9515479	9516640	Oh my god, that was wrong.
9517040	9519482	But anyways... Is that a challenge, Rob?
9519942	9524125	But anyways... There's no dick-measuring challenges here!
9526126	9526627	Anyways!
9527087	9531970	Like I'm trying to say for like the last three minutes, if you have an Xbox for god knows what reason... Shoot yourself?
9532210	9538895	It's gonna be out, I believe, next month for the Xbox with improved graphics and blah blah blah, and wait...
9539622	9542384	Of course you'd need an Xbox, you wanna play DDR Xbox?
9545765	9546066	No.
9547446	9555851	Okay, another one that I actually just, I got to play for a short period of time, which is actually really fun, it's at my house, I gotta start playing it more, is Panzer Dragoon Orde for the Xbox.
9556712	9562135	That game owns me, and that is sad because I fucking hate the Xbox.
9562775	9566137	But I have to speak unbiased, and that sucks ass.
9567628	9570390	First of all, it's Panda Dragoon Order, it's SEGA.
9571551	9574513	Microsoft has not tainted this game except to host the game.
9575594	9575955	It is SEGA.
9575975	9578356	They put their Xbox logo all over the fucking place.
9578376	9579778	But besides that, it's SEGA.
9580378	9582079	SEGA is now the whore of Xbox.
9582840	9585062	You know, there's actual talks of SEGA merging with Namco.
9585802	9588344	Yeah, but Xbox is also talking about buying out SEGA.
9588364	9592988	Originally, wasn't it supposed to be EA or Namco, and then Namco decided to put up more money...
9595219	9600644	Yeah, it's definitely a good game, nice and smooth, and it's pretty much everything you remember from before.
9601585	9602926	Just visually, like, amazing.
9602946	9603967	Visually enhanced.
9604127	9607750	You're still doing pretty much the same thing that you did in the very first Panzer Dragoon.
9608471	9609012	It's a shooter.
9609492	9610553	Yeah, but it's very fun.
9610593	9612054	It's something that you will never get tired of.
9612575	9614677	And there's so much stuff to unlock.
9614717	9616899	You can unlock the original Panzer Dragoon.
9617699	9618800	Dreamcast, you can unlock that.
9619260	9622623	There's a whole bunch of different dragons you can unlock for you to change to.
9623043	9624784	Don't you mean, why do you mean Dreamcast?
9624804	9625445	Don't you mean Saturn?
9626025	9626646	Sorry, Saturn.
9627026	9627586	Oh my god.
9628407	9629768	But, um, yeah, definitely.
9630008	9633430	She keeps showing me this fucking book and it's like, yeah.
9634111	9634411	Anyways.
9635151	9635251	Oh!
9635992	9636112	Oh!
9636132	9636973	Oh, that was good.
9636993	9640235	Let's take a trip back to TimeSplitters 2.
9645553	9648014	This is the funniest game.
9648034	9651815	We're not traveling back hella far, but we're going back a little while.
9652095	9654456	This game is hilarious.
9655056	9660158	Except for the fact that you'll probably never ever unlock absolutely everything in this game.
9660538	9665101	I've been playing it since it came out, and I still don't even have half the characters unlocked.
9665401	9671866	The cool thing about this game is that, well, the thing that Jim and I were playing last night, is you can have a fire extinguisher and brick fight.
9673327	9675208	You sit there and throw bricks at each other.
9676229	9682693	And the coolest thing was, I was a monkey, and Jim was one of the sergeant guys.
9684435	9686276	The monkey is a foot and a half tall.
9687142	9689703	And then you got the sergeant guy who's like 6'6".
9690104	9692805	So this guy's punching over your head and I'm just walking up sucker punching him.
9692985	9695326	And the monkey has hella power but no stamina.
9697407	9703551	Yeah, I'm having to look down all the time just to hit him, but for some reason he's just so goddamn quick.
9703951	9709574	All my shots just constantly keep missing and he's constantly getting a good few sucker punches on me.
9710268	9718359	and he kicked my he kicked the crap out of me and he's a freaking monkey so because I was a monkey the monkey it's all about monkey power anyways goddamn monkey
9719096	9723497	Yeah, basically, the game, the graphics are really good.
9723577	9725137	You gotta love the facial expressions.
9725177	9727818	You can actually see facial expressions.
9727978	9731759	The voice acting is probably one of the best that I've seen in a game in a long time.
9732739	9737520	And I like the fact that the facial expressions and everything was very cartoony like it should be.
9737600	9739821	They weren't trying to be realistic.
9739841	9743482	We're not trying to go fucking Half-Life or Counter-Strike, which is fun to play.
9744622	9747603	And they had the big breasted chicks just like the first one.
9747903	9749043	Dude, the Jungle Queen.
9749863	9751063	Jungle Queen.
9751223	9751903	Dude, okay.
9753264	9755904	She has shit cover in the front, but her ass is totally exposed.
9755964	9758705	Yeah, it's a cheetah thong that doesn't really have a back strap.
9758965	9761605	Yeah, it's like Velcro to her skin or something.
9762605	9762906	Paint.
9763166	9764206	It's paint or something.
9764606	9766446	Maybe it's all natural, who knows.
9766466	9770127	Basically, if you want a game to eat up time, do TimeSplitters.
9770387	9770647	You'll...
9772213	9772894	It's fun.
9773194	9774216	And there's so much shit to unlock.
9774536	9778040	And it has a level editor, which is the greatest thing in the world.
9778141	9780383	If you want to fuck around with your friends, make an insane level.
9781365	9785089	Also, like I said before, you'll probably never unlock everything.
9785169	9787212	And also you can unlock minigames, like Snake.
9788153	9791257	It's called Anaconda, though, and it's actually a lot better.
9793394	9796496	Johnny just brought up something I should maybe bring up since it's video games.
9796716	9797196	What?
9797216	9798838	It's not out yet, but Far Cry.
9799378	9802220	A demo I recommend everyone watch to see what this game's gonna look like.
9803541	9805662	And it's on PC, it's not a console game.
9806303	9807163	Yeah, that just sucks.
9807183	9810626	But once it comes out, though, I'll make sure I have a review for you guys.
9810706	9815549	Right now there's not a whole lot going on the PC front that's worth talking about, game-wise.
9815569	9816990	Vice City's coming out, that's about it.
9817030	9817750	Who the hell cares?
9817790	9820812	I mean, seriously, if you haven't fucking played Vice City by now...
9821993	9823714	What the hell are you even doing on the face of the earth?
9823734	9825355	I just showed up.
9825395	9826096	Say hello to Brad.
9826216	9833640	I just showed up, and the reason why you wouldn't play Vice City on PS2 and you want to play on PC is because it looks like shit on PS2, and it's going to look really good on PC.
9833660	9833981	There you go.
9835001	9835541	And you're on MP3s, too.
9835561	9836762	There you go.
9837863	9840164	Okay, well, yeah, basically... And your own cars.
9841285	9844927	I don't know, unless you can think of... Dude, okay, hold on.
9845067	9846048	Everybody play The Getaway.
9847335	9848937	Play the fucking getaway, okay?
9849257	9852400	You will hear the word fuck in the opening scene at least 50 fucking times.
9852460	9854142	Every fucking goddamn fucking sentence.
9854342	9859727	And it's funny when you hear the random American guy in there, like, you crash his car, he goes, hey, I just painted that.
9860628	9862530	And fuck, in the middle of fucking... I want your Cheetos.
9862590	9863310	Okay, yeah.
9864211	9871700	There's, okay, I'm sitting here playing, and Kara's over at my house, and this guy says, I need to get your details!
9871760	9873562	And someone thought he said, I need my Cheetos.
9873662	9876526	Anyways, unless you can think of anything else, that's pretty much the end of it for this week.
9876746	9878929	I can't think of another fucking bloody fucking thing.
9879149	9882493	Play Counter-Strike Online, um, kill Johnny.
9883391	9883611	Yes.
9883631	9884772	Because he's really good at that.
9885553	9892499	Kill anyone that says 9, the number 9, 1, and then the number 6 in their name because they suck and they all die.
9892679	9894801	Hey, my first day playing, I was killing people.
9894841	9896082	And his name's Unstoppable.
9896183	9898024	If you find 916, Unstoppable.
9898845	9900867	And now I have my retro review.
9900947	9904150	If you go after any team 916, you will die.
9904190	9904790	Trust me.
9904850	9906612	You after 916, you will die.
9908248	9911171	That's the end of the game segment, in case Loki wants to say something.
9912112	9913493	Yes, Loki.
9913653	9921301	Also being released, they mentioned this weeks, weeks, months ago, is going to be One Must Fall Battlegrounds, the 3D fighter.
9921541	9923643	Ooh, did that come out?
9923904	9929129	Well, anyways, I couldn't beta test it because the fucking thing wouldn't work on dial-up, yet they just gave it to me anyways.
9929569	9933152	I have a demo, a really early demo, and I'm not beta testing it anymore, unfortunately.
9933172	9934934	But it's coming out, so look for it.
9935214	9935834	Looks really sweet.
9935854	9937075	They've got really kick-ass arenas.
9937095	9940838	They reproduce all the robots, like, perfectly and added more, and it's really fun.
9940859	9941319	They've got, like...
9942142	9943883	A bunch of different modes you can play.
9944063	9950207	They have a sports type thing where it's some sort of soccer type thing and then just death matches and crazy shit like that.
9951368	9955791	The Scatman needs to be the theme for this.
9956131	9957552	No, it's listless now.
9957953	9959994	Jamie has something retro to bring to the table.
9960034	9960734	Retro review.
9961075	9961715	Retro review.
9962175	9964017	Space Harrier on the 32X.
9965658	9966638	It's the arcade version.
9966858	9967299	End of story.
9970168	9970568	Beautiful.
9972229	9973230	Welcome to the Fantasy Zone.
9973270	9973630	Get ready.
9975811	9984096	If you guys actually want us to review new games, be sure to tell me so that I can actually get out there and test them.
9984116	9988419	Because seriously, I have no idea what you guys want to know about.
9988519	9993442	So drop me a line either in the chat room or email me or something.
9993862	9994863	Most people have my information.
9995283	9995563	That's it.
9997567	10002505	Alright Hopefully, I don't know when they're shipping out the ship for DDR Max 2
10003410	10006873	Maybe not next week, but hopefully the week after we'll have a review on DDR Max 2.
10007013	10009054	Yes, because it's coming out this week, right?
10009254	10015439	Yeah, I've got mine already pre-ordered and everything, but I don't know if they ship them to arrive at your house today.
10015699	10019002	I think they ship it on that date, so in which case I'll get it the week after.
10019042	10024606	If we're able to get our hands on it this week, look for Orange Lounge Radio to go live the night we get it.
10024686	10029550	Bring it over and we'll go live with it the night we get it and we'll play the new stuff for you right off the bat.
10029590	10031211	We'll unlock stuff on air and play them.
10031391	10035133	Yeah, I'll do the controller trick, man, and fucking unlock the whole fucking game.
10035433	10035753	Alright.
10035993	10036593	In one night.
10044917	10057883	Alright, while they drool over Battle Royale manga, we're gonna do... We've only got ten minutes left in the show, but we're gonna do a favorite segment of ours called Ask Orange Lounge.
10061758	10065040	This is where you can ask us whatever you want.
10065720	10069562	Send us questions over private message in the chat room.
10069962	10074084	However, some of your questions in the past have really sucked.
10074525	10076225	Like, will you give me money?
10077426	10078487	Will you buy me this?
10078587	10079367	Will you do this?
10079687	10079867	No.
10080167	10082388	Stupid questions are not getting asked anymore on the show.
10082429	10084390	So please send us something that's worth answering.
10084470	10084870	Thank you.
10085790	10088291	If you ask a stupid question, you'll be kicked.
10088312	10088752	Yeah.
10090023	10090363	All right.
10091024	10092405	I mean, we welcome your questions.
10092485	10096088	And, you know, we do like to say that there's no such question as a stupid question.
10096349	10099031	But, like, are you going to buy me this as a stupid question?
10099051	10099571	I'm sorry.
10099932	10100732	On this show, it is.
10100832	10105216	If you ask the question, am I stupid, we're all going to have a nice big yes for you.
10105396	10105697	All right.
10105877	10106437	Have a nice day.
10106617	10107198	That's from me.
10108539	10109160	Here we go.
10112362	10112643	Hmm.
10112883	10113243	All right.
10113263	10116346	23rd Magus.
10118450	10118610	He did.
10118630	10119711	I have a return question.
10119731	10120712	Why are you even asking us?
10120732	10122273	Yeah, you know who gave you the balls.
10143455	10150197	I mean, I would say when you're up on the altar, that's going to take like 50 times the balls.
10150277	10151697	Because Loki gave him the ball.
10152137	10155298	Not to jump to conclusions here, because these are long ways off in the future.
10155338	10160960	I have a great idea for a mat that had different conclusions on it, and you would jump to them.
10161878	10163299	Yeah, I'm kind of jumping to conclusions here.
10163519	10165060	But the ring, it's just one small step.
10165080	10168643	I don't think there's, it's just, it's more of a case of money than balls.
10168823	10170164	I mean, there's not really balls involved.
10170404	10171785	You like a girl, you buy her something.
10172505	10174006	There's really no balls involved in that.
10174186	10174787	That's just money.
10175407	10176308	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
10176608	10182292	When we get into the more, the longer term commitment stuff, that's going to be the balls, really ballsy stuff.
10182332	10183073	That's what I'm trying to say.
10183213	10185014	Stop patting your ego.
10185674	10186915	Stop patting your ego.
10188856	10189077	Stop.
10189717	10190017	Right now.
10190157	10190978	Dark Child has something to add?
10192347	10195369	Someone wanted to get balls from someone and I wasn't asked to donate?
10199532	10199912	Alright.
10200172	10202074	I have a question, why don't we have a panda mic?
10204756	10210980	Jonas, if you're listening, I gave you $2 a long time ago at the tournament to get me a ball and you never got it for me.
10212681	10214862	Okay, fine then, since he brought up someone owing him money.
10215183	10219406	RoboZ, if you're fucking listening, you still owe me $3 for fucking MGL2.
10220939	10222320	My money, I want a ball, dammit.
10222640	10223841	Alright, more questions, here we go.
10224161	10225742	DDR Angel wants to know, Loki!
10226822	10228843	Which song do you plan on doing a remix to next?
10229684	10230964	I don't know.
10230984	10233186	Uh, I was looking at a bunch of different things.
10233206	10236367	I thought of one the other day, but I'm, like, drawing a blank right now.
10236787	10246373	I... Well, I'm gonna do, um... I don't know, I was looking at ghosts and stuff right now, but I don't know, I've...
10247481	10248202	I have to look at it.
10248502	10254467	It's pretty much whatever works with what I'm... If I find an MP3 that sounds good that would work with something else, then that's what I normally do.
10254748	10256549	And I don't really think of it beforehand.
10257270	10259072	So nothing yet except maybe Ghosts.
10259272	10259732	Maybe.
10259772	10260373	Maybe Ghosts.
10260433	10260973	I tried it.
10261474	10262074	It was alright.
10262375	10267079	There was another one I heard that I thought I could mix with Insertion, but I don't know.
10267700	10268941	I might... Yeah, we'll see.
10271909	10288206	I have to wait until I get my vinyl, because my vinyl's coming, and then, yeah, there's going to be, you know, obviously the show's going to be getting a new Thursday night event, well, at some point in Season 3, or it's going to be the live mix show, and the mixed vinyl on air.
10290301	10291461	That's going to be pretty awesome.
10292282	10293902	That'll be one to listen for.
10294002	10295142	Okay, we're moving right along.
10295162	10297463	I've got a lot of questions to get through in only a few more minutes.
10297903	10299924	Okay, here we go.
10300004	10300364	Zero.
10300804	10302684	Question for Zero from 23rd Magus.
10302764	10303244	I'm scared.
10303404	10307825	Zero, what would you do with two quiet Jap girls, a bucket of Choco Ready Whip, and cake pie?
10311046	10312347	Yeah, what wouldn't I do?
10312787	10313867	Oh, fuck you, pal.
10314587	10316748	No, first of all, they have to be of age.
10317188	10317608	Thank you.
10319218	10324560	He may say of age, but, you know, I will travel to the state where it is legal.
10324981	10325981	La, la, la, la, la.
10326061	10331063	Well, actually, unless it was the UK, because 16 is, you know, they're... Hawaii, 14.
10331163	10333564	Hawaii, 5-0.
10334024	10334685	Oh, my Lord.
10334745	10335385	Is that your answer?
10335405	10336045	What wouldn't you do?
10336065	10336866	Or do you have a better answer?
10336886	10340968	Okay, I would do pretty much everything within reason.
10341288	10343008	I wouldn't go, like... Within reason?
10343048	10344709	Pour them out to edibles or something.
10345690	10347330	And what about cake pie?
10347550	10348751	You wouldn't make them eat the cake pie?
10354046	10362910	Hey Loki, about your Hawaii comic, they gotta have grass on the field before you can play ball.
10365671	10368152	Just because the grass grows doesn't mean it needs to be there.
10369712	10371773	Oh my fucking god.
10374794	10376095	Moving right along...
10377896	10380438	Akuma GM has a good question.
10381318	10384280	Does Beatmania 2DX have a chance in the US?
10385961	10386161	Why?
10386241	10387022	Why no, Zero?
10387502	10387862	Why no?
10389363	10391764	Do we really want to let them ruin another good game?
10393025	10395687	If a goat can sing in American Idol, anything's possible.
10398348	10400609	Let them move!
10400749	10402769	Let them move!
10404109	10407290	If DDR-US mix was allowed, anything could happen.
10407530	10408930	I second that notion.
10408970	10412551	If DDR-US mix was allowed, 2DX-US mix can't be far behind.
10412591	10414052	DDR-USA did not happen.
10415032	10415332	Alright.
10416352	10417632	I'm cutting off questions now.
10417672	10419913	These last five questions I have are it.
10419993	10420233	Okay.
10420793	10424814	VidPala, why does cereal cost so much, and what is your favorite cereal?
10427270	10428570	I like Frosted Mini Wheats.
10429031	10430371	I want to answer your other question.
10432932	10437013	If you go to like Bel Air or Safeway, they have like two boxes of cereal for $4.
10437153	10439574	All the Kellogg's brands.
10439854	10441995	And besides, I like Apple Jacks.
10442475	10443795	Just because I just do.
10444175	10445616	They don't taste like apples!
10445636	10447556	They don't taste like apples, you stupid!
10447596	10448737	What's wrong with you?
10449437	10450477	That's not an answer!
10450697	10451798	They didn't really have an answer.
10451818	10452738	I have another favorite.
10452798	10453498	Crackle Jacks.
10453738	10454738	I like Cracklin' Oat Bran.
10455179	10456239	Cracklin' Goat Brain.
10458772	10460494	It doesn't crackle like Snap Crackle Pop.
10460514	10462475	All right, let's move on, because we've got a bunch of questions to get through.
10462736	10463717	All right.
10464317	10467040	I like Special K and Fruity Pebbles in Captain Crunch.
10467480	10469702	It depends what kind of mood I'm in.
10469842	10474567	Healthy, you know, I go with the Special K. Fruity, I go with, you know, Fruity Pebbles.
10474927	10479071	And just damn, like, cavity, you know, juicy, and I go with Captain Crunch.
10479171	10480232	And why cereal is so expensive?
10480252	10481213	It's because of all the damn toys.
10481573	10482514	And it sponsors terrorism.
10484628	10488451	You know, actually, I used to name my stepbrother Special K. Okay.
10489812	10494616	Now, why it costs so much, it's because it's somehow in some form controlled by the government.
10494656	10495116	I don't know how.
10495156	10495917	I'll figure that out later.
10496317	10503923	But I like to eat what I have for breakfast this morning, but normally I'll just take any kind of cereal and just mix them all together and add sugar and a little bit of milk.
10504323	10505484	I mean, just all the cereals together.
10505504	10506245	That way you get the best of all.
10506285	10512530	You get the marshmallows, the Apple Jacks that don't taste like apples, the Kraken goat brain, and...
10513891	10516572	Darny Darko Rock, Cellar Door, Cellar Door!
10519932	10521273	What you ate for breakfast this morning?
10521873	10526174	Shut up!
10531075	10534896	I had some of these little Japanese candies that have been sitting by the computer for a couple days.
10537190	10560369	Oh yeah, okay, my favorite cereal, I don't eat a lot of cereal, but when I do eat cereal, my favorite is the Pops, Pops, Pops, Corn Pops, yeah, Corn Pops, those are jamming, okay, and the reason why cereal is so expensive is because it's owned by Disney.
10562290	10568815	I say if you think it's expensive, just go buy it at Sam's Club or Costco and buy me a big box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, please.
10568875	10569275	Thank you.
10570376	10570716	All right.
10571697	10572278	Quick questions.
10572298	10572658	Here we go.
10572758	10576401	Nostylan wants to know, when will Orange Lounge be available for DVD or CD?
10576841	10580023	Unfortunately, due to the music that we play during the show, we can't really sell it.
10581464	10583306	As far as the content's concerned...
10584329	10590994	We're still debating kind of the whole internet distribution thing, especially now that some of our episodes are, get this, a year old, getting there.
10591694	10595817	We're thinking about letting those get distributed on Loki's site later, so.
10597038	10599960	But as far as like a CD stuff, there's not really a point.
10600000	10609366	Maybe a clip CD or something, but unfortunately the quality of the show, since we, well, the problem is that we're so low because of the modem ban, the quality of the show is really low.
10610447	10612588	There wouldn't be much point to do an audio CD, it would kind of suck.
10615396	10616156	Last few questions.
10616697	10622660	RYC3, this is kind of for Zero and Darkchild, wants to know, Rice wants to know if you will do a game review on Raven Shield.
10624000	10625021	What is that on?
10625321	10628823	We covered Raven Shield a little bit, or I did, back at the tournament weekend.
10629163	10630924	We didn't have much talking about it, though.
10631184	10633005	We can check it out again.
10633425	10639909	Once they come out with a patch that allows it to be played on my computer, because it detects a bad graphics card, then we'll review it.
10640778	10641479	I just saw something.
10641799	10644581	I wonder if we can actually dual record the show.
10644601	10648824	Like record an archive file and record a high quality file.
10651105	10652166	What if I had a really good computer?
10654348	10656209	I've thought about it and there's a way to do it.
10656409	10657450	And maybe when we move.
10657710	10658190	We'll see.
10658270	10660432	I'll try to do one on Raven Shield for you.
10660832	10664115	Give me a couple weeks to find it and get it set up and I'll have it taken care of.
10664135	10664215	Okay.
10668030	10670572	I love that song since I saw Wendell freestyle it.
10670812	10671853	Um, the song itself sucks, um...
10697623	10698943	I can't think of anything violent.
10699104	10700264	It sucks smegma.
10702305	10703205	I thought it was time.
10703905	10706186	But I like all the songs that nobody likes, so there you go.
10706306	10710127	But you know, to be honest, a lot of the club mix stuff really sucks.
10710187	10712228	I mean, the original Jam Jam Reggae sucks.
10712648	10713368	Jam Jam Reggae sucks.
10713428	10714108	Emotion!
10714309	10715729	Emotion sucks ass.
10716809	10722031	Okay, Emotion sucks ass on there because it sounds like they just recorded someone doing just the key presses of it.
10722111	10724612	It didn't even record it good or anything.
10726750	10732516	And, um, also, but Be My Paradise is alright, except the steps suck ass and it's really slow.
10733718	10740164	And the new double steps that they made for it really suck, because they're just trying to throw in a bunch of 16th note running for no apparent reason.
10740184	10742187	Be My Paradise.
10742207	10742947	I like cheese.
10745890	10746191	Alright.
10746978	10750641	BMI Paradise rocked because Mr. Wendell did this badass freestyle to it.
10751061	10753684	Big guy freestyles kick ass.
10755305	10760289	My appreciation for BMI Paradise went up like tenfold when I saw Wendell humping Mel to it.
10761930	10763732	That was homoerotic wonderful.
10764612	10765673	I appreciate Wendell.
10765873	10766714	I don't appreciate the song.
10768479	10768879	We love Wendell.
10768900	10769981	We need Wendell on this show.
10771222	10772964	All right.
10774446	10784657	One more question from SnubDisanoid wants to know, Loki or anyone that makes edits in the room, I just recently made an Afranova edit, but when I put the steps in the DDR edit max, I was two measures short, too many steps.
10785277	10789382	I have some extra steps before the normal steps start, so should I just eliminate those?
10789742	10793888	No, because DDR Edit Max, a lot of the gaps that sit on there are wrong.
10794589	10796311	I'm going to fix that at some point.
10796672	10801218	Because there's a lot of steps that are out of sync, or they'll be in sync on DDR Edit Max.
10801238	10801778	Yeah, in sync.
10805194	10805995	You are loose.
10806215	10811420	Anyways, um, no, there's a lot of, um, a lot of songs where you can make the steps on there.
10811440	10820909	I think, what was it, Dynamite Rave or one of those was one of the ones that you make on DDR Edit Max and then it gets all fucked up when you play on the arcade and it's like two bars short or something like that.
10821589	10833860	Um, just what I recommend doing is if you've got something to make an Afronova edit, or even like if you have a US version that can make an Afronova edit on there, and like, you know, just figure out what the gap value is on there.
10833900	10837684	It's like one of the, uh, values on there, the MDAT or whatever.
10838865	10841547	Look for that, and then, um, just copy that.
10841768	10847573	Or, or, what you can do is go online, find an edit for an Afro-, you know, another edit for Afronova,
10848164	10856869	and just copy that from theirs and then you'll have your synced up and you can also count how many bars it starts on and just fix it that way.
10856909	10857869	That's what I did.
10857889	10860130	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
10860491	10865453	I'm going to try to fix all of those so that I can be correct.
10866454	10867314	That will come later on.
10867474	10868395	It's on the bottom of my list.
10871232	10872093	Alright, that's it.
10872453	10874275	All the questions from Ask Orange Lounge have been asked.
10874355	10875917	Thank you very much for submitting your questions.
10875957	10876277	We love you.
10876998	10881883	And now it's show end time and we ask everybody for their final thoughts.
10881903	10883985	You want to go first, Jimmy, or you want to wait?
10884245	10884726	You're going to wait.
10884846	10885166	Zero.
10885326	10885847	Final thought.
10888109	10888630	Nice catch.
10890351	10891913	I fit under a desk.
10897994	10899934	Just like an intern to be fitting under a desk.
10900615	10901835	Shut up, dick.
10902136	10902956	While you're down there.
10904877	10905517	Fuck your mama.
10905657	10907578	I have dusting that needs to be done while you're down there.
10908539	10909099	On my ass.
10909299	10909439	No.
10910039	10911060	Jim, final thought.
10913959	10914499	Final thought?
10914579	10918280	Well, this is a pretty cool show for listening to it for my first time.
10918340	10921101	It kind of makes me wish I lived up here to listen to it every single week.
10921621	10922021	We roll.
10922061	10922282	Thanks.
10922582	10922802	Yeah.
10923802	10924282	Keep rocking.
10925082	10925823	Welcome to the show.
10926483	10927243	Listen to the show.
10929864	10936606	Hey, on your first show, you picked the listless thing that ended up winning, so that's not too shabby.
10937233	10939934	I don't know how I did it, because my two other picks got knocked out.
10939954	10943175	Yeah, you kind of had crappy ones out of that, but, you know, Garlic Girls was good.
10943195	10944316	It's alright.
10945096	10945917	It's alright, you're a noob.
10946277	10951699	I'm just kind of having a bad day, I can't, I'm not, what I want to think, come up with, you know, just isn't coming up.
10951739	10953760	We love noobs on Orange Lounge, noobs love us.
10953800	10954060	Alright.
10954460	10954660	Alright.
10955401	10956421	Uh, Loki?
10958762	10960883	Um, I'm starting to get a headache.
10960923	10962964	I fucking think my blood pressure's up or something.
10963684	10966105	I, like, have bad cholesterol or something like that.
10967066	10967666	I don't know what it is.
10967726	10969727	I get a headache all the time when I come over here.
10969767	10970347	I don't know why.
10973268	10973988	I don't know what it is.
10975809	10976389	I blame Rob.
10976929	10982671	Maybe you have cat dander on you from your cat, and that's why I have a mild headache.
10983971	10985752	It's probably shirming that I'm allergic to.
10985872	10986692	Okay, fuck it.
10987612	10987993	All right.
10989353	10989953	Sorry to hear that.
10990133	10990373	Anita?
10991794	10992234	Let's see.
10993214	10995955	Captain Picard is a better captain than Captain Kirk.
10996894	10997915	because he rocks.
10998035	11001457	He's smarter and he holds his age better.
11002897	11003238	Wow.
11005359	11008060	He gets it on in Nemesis and I really don't want to see that.
11009001	11009521	I did.
11012643	11013523	Dark child.
11014784	11016745	Okay, that just made me lose some interest.
11018746	11019547	Final thoughts.
11025976	11028618	I don't really have a final thought, I guess.
11029338	11032020	I'll just throw out something, for the sake of everyone still seeing.
11033982	11035503	What the hell did he just say?
11035903	11037324	Bombay, your final thought?
11037784	11041247	Uh, my final thought, I don't have one, I don't have any thoughts right now.
11042087	11052515	Alright, um, my final thought of the night- My final thought is, you voted, they voted off Legend of Trance after one week, and you fucking kept on Goddamn DuckToy.
11052755	11053756	What is wrong with you?
11054656	11055517	What is wrong with America?
11058430	11059231	Don't get me started.
11059951	11066296	My final thought would be... God bless the USA!
11071759	11072560	My final thought?
11073881	11074802	Fuck you, Squeenix.
11077884	11078564	Very well put.
11079325	11086190	And the last word of tonight goes to... You had it before, and so didn't need a...
11086986	11092830	Let's give it to... Let's give it to... Let's give it to... Dark Child, fine.
11092890	11093610	We'll give it to Dark Child.
11093811	11094211	Last word.
11096465	11101450	Excrement Cranium You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
11102011	11105354	Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.
11105934	11111119	Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
11111400	11114322	If you'd like to leave us a comment, send us an email at
11118406	11121848	And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
11122368	11124909	I will send a flood to wipe out all the bad things.
11125389	11127811	I will save two of everything, but everything else goes.
11128171	11129351	And there'll be a lot of umbrellas.
11130152	11133513	You, Noah, stop what you're doing and build me an ark.
11134254	11135694	And Noah, who is Sean Connery.
11137795	11139696	I'm working on a speedboat at the moment.
11142197	11143458	Speedboat's much faster.
11143538	11145499	I'll shoo across the water a lot faster.
11147372	11148973	There'll be great photos for the Bible.
11155339	11161264	Now, I appreciate your sense of publicity, but I want a dark with a big room for poo.
11161324	11162204	It's going to be important.
11165167	11165647	Speedboat.
11165667	11166608	Let's go for a speedboat.
11166628	11168209	We can get all the animals with long ears.
11168229	11169310	They can sit along the side.
11169330	11173634	Because I like that.
11174972	11176033	No, you build me an ark.
11176173	11178434	Put a big motor in an ark if you want compromise.
11180235	11183137	So he started to build himself an ark, started sawing up timber.
11185719	11187260	That's not actually how you start sawing, is it?
11187700	11193023	You start sawing by going... That first bit where you...
11201194	11206617	Then you're into the middle bit of... Where you feel like your dad.
11211459	11215621	When your dad used to say, I'm off out to the garage to saw a plank of wood in half.
11218042	11220524	There we go.
11223265	11224185	No reason for it.
11225386	11227927	Now, let's see if Dr. Bronowski's still on television.
11228027	11229228	The Ascent of Man.
11231613	11232974	Sundays with my dad, that was.
11234314	11245218	So, yes, um... So the middle bit of the song... And then the end goes back into... And after a while, Noah realised he was actually punching a baboon.
11248459	11249179	Get off me!
11251540	11254721	Stop petting me!
11255481	11256702	What have you got against baboons?
11257662	11260383	I'm not punching a baboon, I'm sawing wood for an arc.
11261437	11265547	Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
11306808	11308050	All right, kids, we're back.
11308170	11309932	Orange Lounge Radio, the afterbirth.
11315278	11316579	Oh, Dark Child has something to say.
11316619	11317320	Yes, Dark Child.
11318692	11320836	Okay, since I wasn't here for fuck you's, I need to say this.
11321357	11326065	Alright, fuck you to like 17 and 16 year old girls that try and pimp on like me and Zero.
11326586	11329010	I mean, first of all, the freestyle is not that cool.
11329771	11331154	Especially when I'm up there doing it.
11331796	11337418	Second of all, once you find out that we're 22 and 23, that means you're underage.
11337599	11338839	We can't do nothing about that.
11339359	11347163	Then, when you call us and find out that we're both taken and have girlfriends, that doesn't mean the next morning you wake my ass up at 10 o'clock in the morning to see what we want to do.
11347843	11349003	That means we're not available.
11349043	11350804	That means back the fuck up off of us.
11350924	11351945	Get off my jock.
11352145	11352545	You know what?
11352585	11354566	At least I was smart enough to give him a wrong phone number.
11355740	11357201	What the fuck, man?
11357781	11360043	No one fucking pips on me when I'm doing shit.
11360303	11361323	What the hell is that?
11362684	11363565	Oh, I see.
11363945	11365666	I just, you know, I'm not good enough for you.
11368027	11370188	I'm not good enough for the underage preteens.
11371369	11375051	I was good enough for you when I used to work pizza and give you a free... You want her number?
11375992	11377112	No, I'm just saying.
11377733	11380334	It's the whole ego building thing, you know?
11380594	11382155	Hey, yeah, she hit on me, yeah.
11382696	11383356	She's underage, but...
11384272	11386133	You know, man, if I was a little bit younger.
11387954	11389836	But, no, it's, what the fuck?
11390416	11391096	That sucks.
11391356	11394919	Instead I get all swayed and they're like, eh, whatever.
11394939	11396980	Whatever.
11397080	11399021	Uh, anybody else have something they want to say for afterbirth?
11400522	11401783	We're talking cosplay, go away.
11403126	11407567	I need to start hanging out with you guys, man, because you get hit on by, like, the chicks and stuff.
11407827	11410028	Why are you looking at Jamie?
11410128	11413008	I got hit on by girls when I was playing Angel Sanctuary.
11414009	11414309	Sweet.
11414509	11416689	I had fan girls and fan boys because I wasn't it.
11417109	11418350	I'm going to try and embarrass Rob.
11419250	11421650	Another thought in the afterbirth, Rob looks hot with a collar on.
11421690	11424331	I mean, if I was gay or even bi, I'd do him if he had that collar on.
11426122	11426963	Oh, the one picture.
11427924	11428525	Eh, we'll see.
11429886	11432529	Maybe if I was going out to the Rage tonight, I could get all gothy.
11433850	11435192	But I'm not, because I'm a dork.
11436926	11437887	No.
11438067	11438847	That's it, you guys.
11438887	11442409	Thank you very much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio and the Afterbirth and the whole nine yards.
11442949	11447872	And after the show tonight is a whole lot of old music, Bomani music.
11448132	11451594	There's lots of, like, five key stuff in here and, like, really old stuff.
11451614	11452654	So you guys want to stay tuned.
11453014	11456236	Tons of stuff you're not hearing right now currently in Bomani music and more.
11456596	11466340	But we do encourage you to listen to the Bobani Music Amore program, which runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station when we're not here, with all your favorite DDR, 2DX, and Dance Mania favorites.
11466660	11468201	And when you whore up our ratings, we love you.
11468421	11471323	Have you ever noticed every week you try to say that faster and faster?
11471643	11473383	Yeah, because I want to go get Boba.
11474484	11478085	But even though I'm saying it fast, I have to express my love for everybody.
11479086	11480947	I just want to collectively go down on all of you.
11482091	11482991	Wow, I'm leaving.
11483071	11483571	Goodbye.
11483932	11484352	Not you.
11484812	11485492	Thank God.
11486072	11490113	Before we get to the classic Bomani stuff, I had a quick request I am granting.
11490153	11491073	The cheat is not dead.
11492054	11493854	Yeah, the cheat is not dead.
11494154	11495315	I don't have Fogota guys on me.
11495375	11496475	But the system is down.
11496615	11498636	We're going to get Boba anyway, so bye.
11546534	11556720	My story's ending, like a fairy tale, my life Changing forever, I'm fighting in my mind I'm missing love, believe me I'll be someone Wish you'd love me, oh pretty girl You asked me to fall in love with you, take me to my soul
11576326	11577507	Thank you for watching!
11607145	11607905	Thank you for watching!
11635109	11636569	Thank you for watching!
11700916	11701420	I feel my life
