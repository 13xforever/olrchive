Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
Just kidding.
Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.
In this episode... Hey, are there any balls down there?
That's the biggest fairy you ever seen, Jingle Fairy.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Showgirls.
Absolute fright.
What's yours?
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.
Don't torture yourself.
That's my job.
Now's the time when Sprockets made me dogs!
I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too.
I know Kung Fu.
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
Why did they have to take the word gang?
No one expects us to punish exposition!
Yes, yes, yes!
DarkSakura, Shut up!
Where's my gun?
This is my boomstick!
Sky, Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!
Loki, I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.
What kind of warping being would find that funny?
Orange Lounge Radio.
We are live and this is episode number 41 for April the 20th of 2003.
You're tuned into the Bomani Scene's most egg-citing radio station of all things.
Be... Mommy!
That was bad.
I came up with that joke all by myself.
Hand.
Ow.
Did everyone hear that?
Here, I'll do it louder.
Ow!
Mommy!

Orange Lounge Radio With the Ping Pong Ball
I think that's my favorite sound effect that Jamie ever did.
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 41, April the 20th of 2003.
Happy Easter to all you kids out there listening, and if you aren't down with Easter, then happy Sunday to you.
I totally forgot it was Easter, that's why the arcade was empty.
You didn't do anything today?
No.
I went over to my parents' house and had a little ham, and that was it.
We had ham a week ago, so I just ate food.
Just ate food.
A late happy birthday wish to Jamie.
She was one year older as of yesterday.
Happy birthday wishes to you.
Thank you.
Because your birthday was yesterday.
Thank you.
And how did you celebrate?
I killed people.
Oh, wait.
I'm sorry.
I went to the auction, and I got Legendary Axe for the TurboGrafx.
Cool.
I didn't know they made that for TurboGrafx.
Yep.
And I got, um, uh, what was it?
Some game for the Atari adapter for the ColecoVision.
I don't remember what it was.
Centipede.
Oh, cool.
Turns out I already had it.
This lovely bit of literature that you gave me.
Ah, yes, my present, which are always the best.
Which I'm busy trying to remember.
It sucks because I'm so out of practice on my Hiragana that I'm having problems reading some of these names.
I haven't gotten anything yet because I had to buy my mom something her birthday's tomorrow.
That's fine.
You know, priorities and all.
And you gave me a gift certificate around here.
So I can go buy my Battle Royale novel when it's in stock.
So you can indulge more in that Battle Royale-ness.
That big inside joke that just won't die.
It's beyond an inside joke at this point.
It's a lifestyle for some.
I got a really cool card from Brad and Irene.
It's one of my favorite first...
One of my favorite Farside ones is the Many Expressions of the Irish Setter, which are all the same.
And I got money from Grandma, which I put in the bank to pay bills because I'm currently not working.
And I got lunch from Jessica.
And she bought me a clip-on desk lamp so that I can not go blind when I draw.
Very cool.
And I got... You can maybe double and use it with your Game Boy, too, if you want to.
My Game Boy has an afterburner.
Oh, I've got an afterburner.
I've got lots of ice cream.
Ooh, ice cream's always good.
Did you have cake and ice cream?
No, I didn't have cake.
I had brownie and my ice cream.
Well, that's close enough to cake.
Cake pie!
Cake pie!
I want ice cream.
Julie got me boba.
We can go get, let's get ice cream after tonight's show.
Okay.
I want ice cream too.
Are you going to get me ice cream?
I guess I can.
Woohoo!
Because I'm broke.
See if I didn't spoil you enough.
That's alright.
I need more ice cream.
I'm only looking for cake pie ice cream though.
We should take, we should get some cake batter ice cream and some like pumpkin pie ice cream and mix them together.
Voila!
Cake pie ice cream.
They don't have pumpkin pie ice cream.
They don't have pumpkin pie ice cream?
But you know what my favorite is now is getting the cake batter ice cream.
Huh?
Get pumpkin ice cream.
I'm so fucking hungry!
My favorite now is the cake batter ice cream with brownie and coconut.
I used to get cheesecake with graham cracker and cherries.
This is like Iron Chef where the secret ingredient is cold stone.
By the way, do you want to see a really painful way to die?
Okay, because this will be great radio.
Isn't this a great picture of...
That's... Oh my god, he looks like Nine in that picture.
Or are you talking about the other one?
Oh, hello.
Okay, I'm gonna scan this.
He's sexy.
And send pictures of this to everybody here because this is like the best manga ever.
It shows this guy here.
I forgot which one he is.
It has this picture of him, of Nimura hugging the younger one to comfort him.
And then these bullets going through his face.
Aww.
And like it has the bullet time trail like in, um, what was that game?
on PC.
Dead to Rights.
No, no, no.
Where he'd go into bullet time and he'd dodge all the bullets.
Dead to Rights.
Max Payne.
Max Payne.
Max Payne.
You know what I have to say about that?
He looks like Big Boy.
Death to Frodo.
That's what it looks like.
Death to Frodo.
He does look like Frodo.
And look, when he falls on the ground, his head busts open and there's brains all over the place.
Ew.
and he got shot across his belly and his intestines start coming out so he freaking duct tapes them back in.
Oh, nasty.
Are they ever going to make a Battle Royale video game?
Why don't they?
They should.
Why don't they?
Because we suck.
They won't make a video game because we suck.
Damn right, because the stupid Americans get offended by everything.
Oh my god, it's red!
Which insinuates blood!
Which is bad!
As he's bleeding to death, he wires a bomb.
This is so cool.
I don't know if I'm going to regret buying that for Jamie.
She might come up with too many ideas.
And then he tries to pull up Kiriyama.
And Kiriyama, by the way, looks like the Uber Bishonen.
Instead of looking like the Japanese guy who's not.
If you hear of any large explosions in the Sacramento area, I've never met Jamie.
Never knew her.
Anyways.
So, orders of business tonight.
As you may or may not know, tonight, ladies and gentlemen, is the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
In this studio.
Just had to get him going for a minute.
Yes, tonight's the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio in this studio, in this lovely little house that I'm in right now in Orange Lounge World headquarters in Citrus Heights, to be specific, California.
It's the last one here because we're going to have Battle Royale here tomorrow.
We'll invite a bunch of people that I don't like and then I'll kill them.
Then I'll die.
So, we have the chat room going for a minute.
They're all, no!
I love lag.
Anyway, actually it's... Haha, fooled you!
We got a lame alert.
Actually, what's going to happen, next week's show, okay, what's happening next Saturday is the big move.
And what's happening is I'm moving out of the house I'm in right now.
And I got to give a big thank you on the show, even though he's not listening right now to Brian, my current roommate.
I don't know if he is listening.
I don't know.
But he's put up with a lot of crap.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I'll have the computer set up.
That's like priority number one.
I can't live without my computer.
You said we might not have the internet in time.
That's my problem.
You have the computer set up and there might not be an internet.
Why?
We have to call this week and get it set up.
I know, I know, I know.
They might not come out until Monday or Tuesday if they're not open on the weekend.
I have to dial up.
I still have my internet.
We'll figure something out.
We'll figure something out.
But bare minimum, there'll be a tape show next week.
There'll be some kind of show, new show this Sunday.
And then after that...
New show, that'll be interesting.
We'll get you a stripper.
My birthday's coming up, and this is a big one, because I'm 25 this year.
I can't believe I just gave my age over here, God.
Now I'm like, I just placed myself in that, I'm an over 20 DDR player.
I was very happy because the guy at Coldstone, first of all, Julie made them sing to me.
I wanted to die.
Secondly, the guy behind the counter, in all seriousness, because I looked to be sure, asked me if I was turning 18.
I was like... Did you get carded to an R-rated movie?
Hey, that's not funny.
That's not funny at all.
Stupid freaking dead man at Campus Chico Theater.
You suck.
At least he didn't ask for my... Hi, can I speak to your mommy?
No, you can't fucking talk to my mommy.
Why would the Coldstone guy want to talk to your mommy?
No.
See, I don't mind when I'm looking face-to-face with someone.
Hey, little girl, I bet your mommy's pretty hot.
What the hell?
Why would he want to see your mommy?
No, I'm talking to him.
I know.
I know.
But I told him to die, go to hell, and opt me off his mailing list.
That'd be like, you know, some guy going, hey, I bet your mom's pretty hot.
Well, she's dead.
Oh, good.
Then she can't say no.
Loki's unpolitically correct.
Statement of the night, thank you.
I screw political correctness.
It's an excuse.
It's a crutch.
Back to the story of the moving in Orange Lounge Radio.
So in two weeks, we'll be coming to you from our brand new studio.
We'll be freeloading.
Our brand new studio.
If there's a problem, though, maybe we can... You can pay for my gas.
If there happens to be a problem, maybe we can convince Jamie to do Studio Jamie for a night, which would be fine.
Why?
I'm going to be there, too.
I know, but if something happens and our internet's not up by then, we might have to do that show at your house.
Oh, broadcast?
If something happens, yes.
Well, I guess no Xbox Live for Dan that night.
Well, we'll figure something out.
I'm pretty sure the internet will be up for us by then.
Oh, darn, I was going to leave it on PSO.
Logged in, sitting there.
It's really funny to go on PSO and just stand there and have people talk to you.
Have you done that?
Do you watch people talk to you?
People come up, what level?
Dot, dot, dot, dot.
Okay, dot, dot, dot.
You know what people do on PSO that I find hilarious?
Like, I went on PSO one night, and this guy was just running in a circle.
He just ran in a circle around the lobby.
He just kept running in a circle.
And then, like, people would try to talk to him, and he just kept running.
Like, he did that.
I swear to God, I would sit there for ten minutes and watch this guy just keep running in a circle.
And then, finally, some guy started running behind him.
Yeah.
and pretty soon I got in on it too and then like six of us were all running in a giant circle.
It was like a big fucking PSO conga line.
It was like the nerdiest thing I'd ever seen in my entire life.
Speaking of online games, and this only goes out to the smart people, which are basically all of our listeners are smart because they're listening to us.
If you go to SquareEnixUSA.com you can sign up, you can register to beta test Final Fantasy XI for PC or PS2.
PS2, that's funny I know, that's a hilarious joke I signed up for the PC one
Because you know what?
When Final Fantasy XI came out, first of all, my first impression was this is the biggest pile of suck there could be.
And then the other thing was, I want to play it.
If I get Final Fantasy XI, I have to have a hard drive.
Maybe I can convince Dan to work that into the bills, get a hard drive for my PC.
Why can't they just, you know what they should do?
Square should just say, okay... Squeenix.
Squeenix should just say, okay, you know, this game really sucked ass.
Maxis, what can we do to make this game better?
Put it on PC.
No, fucking we need Sims mixed with, you know, Final Fantasy.
It's awesome.
Sims is addicting.
People love it.
You know, they love creating shit, making new skins and all that crap.
But just, you know, with Final Fantasy, you have a little bit of fighting, a little bit of this, a little bit of that.
It sounds good.
I don't know.
Final Fantasy X was good.
Damn it.
They're remaking all these Final Fantasy games.
Why don't they remake Final Fantasy VI and CG-lock for me?
That'd be cool.
And Shadow.
I don't think she died in the video, no.
She gets attacked by, like, butterflies.
I might have to see that.
She doesn't really get attacked, it's supposed to be her coming out of her cocoon.
Symbolic crap.
I don't want to know about her.
She's going in as a crack whore and coming out crack whore.
No, she's going in as a crack whore.
That means people pay for her.
Coming out as crack slut.
No one wants to pay for her.
You have to think of how many diseases you would catch.
That's where the full body condom comes into play.
Okay.
So yeah, Orange Lounge Radio, going to be a new studio in the new world headquarters in Folsom, California with a scenic view of Folsom State Prison.
Coming to you in two weeks.
Yeah, come over, we live right by the damn road.
When my brother was little, when I went to Arizona to visit my mom, we went to Vegas.
My brother seriously would call it the Hoover Darn.
Because damn is a bad word.
Oh, oh gee!
It's a bad word.
We're going to have so much shit wired in that new... I have good news, by the way.
Yes?
I'm going to say this right now because I brought up my brother.
I love him anyway.
No, I always thought the Marines were like this elite fighting force, yet you keep hearing more and more and more and more and more of them, you know, being made.
I don't know, are they just like... Because they're on the front.
They're the front.
So they're first.
First in, first out.
I can't believe you said that.
It's a South Park reference.
It's loud.
What's interesting is that, you know, one goes out and another goes in.
Our friend, the other Jamie, we know, is going in.
As one goes out, one goes in.
Hope they don't make her do too many push-ups, but, you know, does the body good.
I stayed away from the military, and I'm glad that, you know, as horrible as it is,
to be run over at 13 and have your leg put back on.
I'm glad that Dan was run over and had his leg put back on because there's no possible way he could ever serve in the military.
You know what's interesting, and this has absolutely nothing to do with our show, but whatever, who cares.
Porn.
Yeah, porn, no.
It's funny.
No, this is about my dad, not porn, God.
Ew.
My dad was not able to go to the Korean, my dad's a little bit older than probably a lot of your daddies, he was going to go to the Korean War.
And they sent him home because he has an extra vertebrae.
Whoa.
I would think he'd be in there.
It's like, damn, man, if he gets hurt, take one out.
He's normal.
It makes me wonder, though, if I got that.
Like, I need to have somebody count.
I've never had a doctor count, like, see if I have extra vertebrae.
You're supposed to have a certain amount.
I just thought they were just there.
Yeah.
Crazy, huh?
Yeah.
Let's all count.
Let me take my shirt off.
I recommend that you do this while you're driving.
It's just awesome.
Rob, keep your shirt on.
I've seen you in a corset.
So have I, unfortunately.
So have I. Thank God it's a radio show, because I'm wearing it right now.
I was bored one day, and I was just browsing the internet.
I was like, you know, I'll read live journals.
I read live journals, saw a link to the site, saw the pictures.
But actually, you know what's funny?
My friend Sean thinks he knows you.
Because he used to do Rocky down at the Birdcage.
You think you know him?
And he thinks he knows you, too.
I never did Rocky.
Oh, you never did Rocky.
Okay, he doesn't know you then.
He knows Jessica, maybe.
I don't know.
We'll talk off air, because I bet our listeners really don't give a shit.
See, me, I did conventions.
I'm a cosplayer.
Yay!
Okay.
So?
What's the point?
What's the point?
Because that means I'm going to go around and kill people, because cosplayers eventually go psycho, because one little thing goes wrong, and they go around killing everyone.
Not really.
I need a machete.
You need a machete?
Yes.
Why?
I'm starting customer service.
Oh, your job starts tomorrow, huh?
No, it starts next Monday.
Oh, good, we have another week of fuck-off shows on Orange Lounge Radio that go until 5 in the morning.
No, no.
See, me staying up until 5 in the morning and then waking up at 7 a.m., going back to sleep,
Getting up at 10am, going back to sleep.
I can't do this business of staying up until 8 in the morning.
I was staying up until 8 in the morning on average.
You know what, last night I went to bed and the sun was coming up and I was like, God, I haven't done this in a long time.
Bob?
Yeah?
I went to bed when the sun was already high overhead.
So I did something really stupid.
I stayed up all day and all night.
And I was inspired to write lots of fun stuff too.
Really?
Yeah, I didn't write a damn thing.
Because I'm lazy.
Every time I start typing, I'd be like, why did I just type in Russian?
That's the most entertaining thing to do is you start typing and you start writing something and you're really, really tired.
And then you go back and read it and you're like, what the hell?
No, when I'm sleep deprived, I make the funniest typos.
It's great.
I started keeping a log of my typos.
I have a breaking news announcement.
ViolentHyperGirl, you may know her from Fremont 2.
She was the one, if you've seen pictures from the Fremont 2 tournament, she was whipping me.
She is coming to Davis for college.
Which means Puppy has someone to play with so he won't get so bored.
And somebody to meet us for Boba.
But guess what?
I am getting another breaking news.
There's a TapX in Sacramento now.
Where?
Pocket Road in a shopping center.
Where the hell is Pocket Road?
Is that
Yeah, it's South Sac somewhere.
So Skyline, find the address and give it to us now.
We are going now.
I just hit my knee.
I hit my head.
And, um, as Dark Tetsuya said earlier, is this going to be one of those shows?
It's always one of those shows.
Alright, we can talk about Bomani News, and I'll make it quick.
Oh, well, no, let's take a break before we do the news.
We've got to tease the news.
Tease the news.
Tease the news.
We're going to talk about...
I was teasing.
I thought you were going to go in the song.
No.
We need to be, you know.
Oh, as soon as our, like, you know, other people arrive, we can do listless.
Because we have a special one.
Okay, we can tease this.
I'm going to play, I don't know the quality of this mp3, I just got it.
It's crap!
But you can, yeah, it's mp3.
It's crap, though.
Okay, it's a crap one, but we'll try it.
It's from Guitar Freaks.
This is one of the Guitar Freaks.
These are pretty good.
Okay, good.
This is the brand new B4U song from Guitar Freaks 9th and Drum Mania 8th.
We'll see if it's any good or not.
Chikara, I haven't heard this yet.
Is it bad?
We'll see.
We're going to take a quick break.
B4U, what do you expect?
Okay, we'll be back after a quick break, and we're going to talk about Bomani News.
Oh my god!
Thank you for watching!
Okay, Jamie has a quick announcement.
First person to say die, kill Kai gets kicked.

Thank you for watching
And now something I want to hear, Suffer.
and now something the chat room made us think of.
Okay, we've been getting a lot of requests for this this week, so I'm going to play this one more time.
Loki's mix for Schlagwerk called the DarkSakura will fuck you up mix.
And Loki, where can they download this?
DarkSakura.com
It's definitely worthy of the name DarkSakura will fuck you up.
It's the first good mix I've ever received.
DarkSakura, what will you fuck up today?
What will I fuck up?
Aww, Jamie needs a hug.
I'll fuck your world up.
You're supposed to say the Easter Bunny.
I don't want to fuck the Easter Bunny.
This is fucked up!
Here is justice.
Here is punishment.
This is fucked up!
From Step Squad to Orange Lounge, this PDR sucks!
Holler, holler, holler, holler!
GGBO!
and all those other acronyms I don't understand.
Big hello to Step Squad.
Any of you folks listening?
Yes.
A big hello to all of you listening because we love the people that listen to Orange Lounge Radio and that means you.
Love you guys.
If you would like to join in the fun, the big gangbang orgy in our chat room, I mean, well, it's a Mississippi orgy because nobody in there is wearing shoes right now.
Yes.
The law is no socks, no shoes, and people of multiple genders, all three or four or five of them.
That's a Mississippi orgy.
It's a Mississippi orgy.
We had a Mississippi orgy at my house the other night.
And then we killed each other.
With paper plates and magic markers and candles.
If you want to join in the big Mississippi orgy that is our chat room, head on over to Calibamani.com, our friends over there.
Click on Orange Lounge and then click on chat.
And it has all the instructions.
There's a Java chat, there's an IRC chat, whatever you need to do to get in the room.
When you said chat, I thought you said shat.
Live Uncensored Radio Fuck, fuck me, fuck, fuck, fuck Hey, you know what I saw for the first time today?
Never s- You go to hell!
You go to hell and you die!
That was so easy I hate to say it, but you do get to sing for that Bitch Love you too
No, what I saw for the first time, it's kind of close actually, for the first time today, I saw G4 TV, because my parents have it, believe it or not.
Did it suck?
It was interesting, it's, you know, we... Did you have GamePro TV on?
No, GamePro TV was not on, I watched a show, I watched something called... Did GamePro TV was the best?
I...
Oh my god, J.D.
Roth!
That's sad that I know that.
Dude, J.D.
Roth is the man.
We've already gone over this.
That's still laughing.
I watched a show called Blister, I think it was, with this guy who thought he was funny, who wasn't.
And what was the other show I watched?
Something called Cheat.
Yeah, it was Cheat.
That's what it was called.
And it was just them giving a lot of... Cheat is not dead!
That's where Homestar Runner is going to sell out to, G4.
This is the funny thing, though.
They didn't get a... Jamie, is your mic on?
Yes.
They're asking what you got a zing for.
My mic is on.
Go back to the thingy.
That's weird.
They asked what you got a zing for.
Nobody heard that?
I guess you guys weren't listening.
Okay, fuck y'all.
Not really.
Let's reenact.
Hey, Jamie, guess what I saw for the first time today?
Pussy!
Zing!
You got me.
You bitch.
Alright.
Speak up, my ass.
We're running through the fucking mixing board.
No one has to speak up.
You turn your damn speakers up, okay?
I don't want to speak up, my ass.
Rant.
Anyway, oh, doorbell.
G4, really quick, because I know we have news we want to get to.
It was interesting.
Why aren't we on G4?
Our show would work on G4.
Because we don't suck.
I wouldn't say G4 sucks.
They're just new.
They're in their infancy.
We need the next channel, G5.
I want G69.
Oh, Irene's here.
And how dare they name that channel after a really shitty Macintosh computer.
That's what I want to know.
Is it just you or is Brad with you?
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Promises that we do Bomani news when we come back to this break.
So I'll hand it off to Loki because he always has something to say Bomani related.
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
But yeah, that's what's coming.
Basically, you get an update every Thursday or Friday, I believe, on their Max2 site.
They update it every week.
And supposedly, this coming up week will be new codes for DDR Extreme.
Supposedly, it'll be the last codes, but who really gives a shit?
Fucking roulette.
Fucking roulette.
I hate your roulette.
Well, I'll get into that later.
Yes, it's not time for the fuckies of the week.
Yes.
Jam and Marmalade.
What?
Paranoia Survivor.
I didn't read anything.
Oh, yeah.
It's rumored to be on there, I think.
Or no.
Oh, more Paranoia.
Yay.
Yeah.
Paranoia Survivor is rumored to be in Unlock on Max 2.
But guess what?
Guess what Glacial is?
Glacial is... Was a character in Killer Instinct.
No.
No.
It's a cover song.
It's a cover song done by B4U.
It's an English song.
Fuck, I can't remember what song it is.
It's a B4U cover of a song.
I can't remember.
I posted about it like a while ago, but it's just escaped my mind right now.
If we go to the Max Suicide, I can tell you because it says on it.
That's a future listless topic in waiting.
B4U, a song we'd like to see B4U ruin.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Taka Remixed by Tak
Is it TAC Remix?
Well, either way, it's pretty much Outface.
It's Outface-y!
So, let's hear a little clip, because this is kind of bad quality.
We apologize, but it's all we got right now, but you can get a feel for it.
You can hear that guitar sound in it.
It sounds like a remix of Stoic mixed with Diamond Jealousy.
That's Yamaoka.
I know, but that's what I'm saying what it sounds like.
My tack-dar went off.
Tack-dar?
I'm now, um, I have to clean up, excuse me.
Okay, while she's cleaning up, let's play a little bit of the Abyss remix.
This is Abyss, the Heaven's Mix.
And if you remember Ryu, who did Starmind and Fourth Mix, he's the guy who remixed this.
Here, a little clip of this.
It doesn't sound a goddamn thing like the original.
Judging by the key presses, which I heard very loudly, that's either a 5 or 6.
Could have been Light 7, just to throw you, though.
In fact, if they're recording it, they probably did it in Light 7.
It could have been me trying to play a 7-star song.
Okay, this one I'm really excited about.
This is the new ping-pong song, Power Dream, and this song really kicks ass.
I'm looking forward to hearing the better quality version of this.
Ding, ding, ding That just totally sounds like digital mind A little bit, a little bit But it's got its own happy carnival If it's tech, it's not happy Virtual mind, I'm sorry There you go, okay If it's tech, it's not happy Shit, what's that other one?
Mind Parasite I knew it had mind in it, god damn it Mind Parasite, it sounds just like Mind Parasite
I've lost my mind, they're coming to take me away, haha
Next one we're going to preview for you, the last one we're going to preview for you, this is Prelude, and this is one I'm excited about.
This is the new Naoki Underground song.
I thought you were excited about the other one.
What?
About the nine parasite.
No, well, I am, I'm, whatever.
Let's just hear this.
Now I remember!
Hold on.
Yeah, stop for a sec.
Glacial.
It was going to be a cover by Ryu Kosaka of Hypo Yorubi.
Oh, God.
That's what it is.
Now I remember.
I actually like Hyper Eurobeat.
There's one song I'm less excited about.
All right.
The new System SF song.
Yay.
Okay.
Here we go.
This is a little clip of Prelude by Naoki Underground.
This is my favorite so far, I think.
It's like L'Amour et la Liberté.
What did you say before that, though?
You said something... I was like, yay, it's another classical piece.
Yay, another classical piece they ripped off.
Yay, it's Vanity Angel all over again.
Now I'm going to preview for you Prelude featuring Paula Terry.
Rob?
Yes?
Rob?
I'm sorry, but now you have to die.
Give me that!
I have two microphones now.
No, no, what that should be is Prelude featuring Mr. Ryan and whatever the final band.
If it was Prelude featuring someone farting, it would sound better than Politary.
Anyway.
Prelude featuring my ass!
Where's the burrito?
Prelude featuring my bunghole!
Okay.
Um...
Moving on.
Another interesting bit of news here.
I was given this tip.
I was given a tip, a lead, from a fellow in our chat room who goes by the name John Fields.
And Project Majestic Mix.
I have no idea who that is, but I think they're a band.
However, they have a newsletter, and this is what their newsletter says.
In light of our new dance album in the works, some of you may be interested to know that we have obtained permission and are working planning to include our very own DDR PC Max CD-ROM game as part of the limited edition extra.
Your computer fell apart.
Rob, is your computer feeling fresh?
You're laughing at the computer, not the story, right?
My computer is just ghetto.
Okay, let me finish.
Can I finish?
Can I finish?
Majestic, oh, they did remixes of Final Fantasy music.
Anyway, the whole graphics, sound effects, music, and announcer voices are planned to be 100% original.
We not only plan on including DDR versions of some of the new album music, but some remixes from our other album releases.
Gee, that sounds like Step Mania to me, you ass.
Freaking idiots.
Wait a minute, this could be officially Konami endorsed, though.
That's the big deal about this.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Sure.
Sure.
Wait a minute though, wait a minute though.
Would somebody who's putting out like a bonafide real album be that risky?
It's gotta be Blessed by Konami if they're gonna rip off a DDR interface.
I'll have you know that my next track will be in the next DDR Max 3 for the home version, yes.
A new track.
In fact, it's all my music.
In fact, they're giving me all the proceeds from that.
Could you listen to this part again, Loki?
We have obtained permission.
Which would mean...
Good on me, right?
Which means crap.
It means we've obtained permission to remix their music, saying that we won't permission to slap you.
That's all it says.
That means look for a press kit, look for the press releases.
It means don't jack shit.
It means jack shit, exactly.
It means that they've obtained permission to remix the official songs that they made from the DDR home versions.
That's all it is.
Can I remix this song?
Sure, son, why not?
I was just thinking if there's anything on their site.
Whatever, you know, fine.
If it is, yay.
You know, whatever.
DDR PC sucks anyways.
Mr. Spanky!
Well, we shall see what happens.
Oh, maybe it's DDR Ultramix.
Alright, Majestic Mix, if you're listening, surprise the pants off of Loki, because that would be funny.
DDR Meow Mix?
Did you tell everyone about the Will & Grace episode?
Will and Grace is gay.
Yeah, it's about, you know, a fag and his... No, not the show, the episode.
Okay, well, it's Grace's birthday and Jack and Karen take her out to an arcade and there's a fifth mix and they play it.
What song do they play?
Well, they don't play songs that are really in DDR.
Well, Jack plays Holiday, but not like the DDR version.
What about
Well, it has the background to Abyss, which is funny.
Holiday has Abyss' background, apparently.
Like, on the screen, it says Abyss, and he's playing Holiday.
But, like, when she's going to play another game, there was, like, Puzzle Fighter 2 or something.
Like, it was playing Abyss in the background, and it played Dynamite Rave also while the kid was playing.
Yeah, the little kid was playing Dynamite Rave.
And then Grace.
It was so funny to watch Grace dance.
You make it sound like my anti-TV stance is like total social deprivation.
It is.
Well... Shut up.
I didn't ask you.
It was sort of wrong.
My life is much more enriched through reading fanfiction.
I mean, books.
But is DDR in your fanfic episodes?
They could be.
I will put DDR in my next story.
How's that?
Fair enough.
Oh, doorbell.
Let's see who comes to the door now.
Who's going to get it?
Loki.
I bet it's... Oh, Brian's got it.
I bet it's... Oh, no, our intern.
I have no idea who's coming through the door.
It's our intern.
It's our intern zero.
Hello.
Do you have anybody with you?
Um, yeah.
This is Jim.
Hi, Jim.
He's from Fremont.
Hi, Jim from Fremont.
Everyone can say hi.
And who else is here?
Anita.
Hi, Anita.
Johnny.
Hey, everybody.
And Jason.
Dang, what the hell?
There's a party all of a sudden.
Yeah, we all fit in a clown car.
I'm sitting here going, gee, we've got like only the three of us here at house, and then all of a sudden everybody's showing up.
Yeah, the clown car show.
Hello.
What's up, everyone?
This is Jim.
Nice to meet you all.
Do you play DDR at all?
I'm afraid to say no.
You'll fit right in.
All right, Anita.
Hi, DDRcoholic here.
How is everybody?
Good.
How's your DDR addiction?
Oh, well, I'm on step nine of the 12-step program.
It's coming along.
It's coming along fine.
Remember, NyQuil's the 13th step.
NyQuil is the 13th step, and I am almost ready with my case of NyQuil.
I'm just waiting to open it.
And we have... It's D-Child.
God, I'm so fucking tired right now.
Well, how late did you stay up?
Uh... Did you stay up to greet the Easter Bunny?
Yeah.
I greeted the Easter Bunny all right.
Where's my damn candy?
Yeah, so anyway, yeah, DDR on Will and Grace.
Ha, that was funny.
That was probably the dumbest thing I've heard all day.
Yeah.
About, yeah, yeah.
Oh, who else, who else is here?
Oh, there's somebody in the hall.
Hi, what's up?
This is Bombay.
I got to beat your character up today in Soul Calibur.
Did you, did you beat her hard?
I beat her long and hard with my lesbian character.
With the big titties.
They're all lesbians.
This is the first time I've played Soul Calibur 2 in a long, long time.
Taki is the dyke of the game.
She's also the dominatrix.
But then suddenly I was... Taki is... She does whatever.
She's good for anything.
And then Cassandra's the quick lay.
She does everybody.
Conquest came up and suddenly I'm fighting D-Child.
I'm like...
Did you fight F-Yo Mama?
I don't remember fighting F-Yo Mama.
That's it.
You're going to find a Killik named DarkSakura in there.
Okay, newsflash.
His special attribute is cheat bitch power.
Newsflash, we have the address to the new TAPEX from Skyline.
There's a TAPEX in Sacramento now, in South Sac.
Those bitches, my dad was going to make one, and then they brought one here.
Yeah, there's one in Southside now, so we might go after the show.
Alright, I'd just like to say, coming from the Bay Area where there's real boba and real pearl tea, Tapioca Express is gay.
It's all we got!
It's really not that bad.
I mean, I've tried some of the boba that we had at that one place in Fremont.
Was that real boba?
Okay, their boba is just as good.
What, like lolly cup?
No, dude.
Any other Bomani news you can think of, Loki?
Was there anything else this week we had to talk about?
Yeah, your car.
Want to talk about your car?
That was funny.
Tell us all about the car prank you played while I look up to see if there's any other news we're missing.
That was hilarious.
at my work on Friday they brought for a promotional thing for Fast and Furious the tricked out edition DVD that's coming out they brought one of the cars from Too Fast Too Furious which I must say that this car while being in the movie was stock and it just had a nice paint job it was
which was sort of getting chipped and actually someone stole the exhaust off of it they physically cut the exhaust off with a hacksaw that was hilarious but yeah, it was really cool and no one could tell but
I took my friend Andy, who's kind of a fanatic about the whole thing, he took pictures of him taking the car off of the trailer and stuff, and then I took a picture inside the car.
So I thought it'd be really funny, because, you know, I was really bored that day, to post pictures online of me sitting in the car telling people that I bought the car off of eBay.
Because if anyone knows me, I have just been buying shit off of eBay like crazy.
So it's slightly believable, but then again, yeah.
I first started getting suspicious when I saw it was parked on a sidewalk, but then just to check on how much they were, I went on eBay, and those cars aren't that bad priced.
I saw a Beamer that was fully tricked out for under $30,000, and I mean, Beamers for under $30,000, that's pretty good.
Yeah, so anyways, I had a couple people go in there for like a little bit.
I was waiting for Rob because Rob, I was thinking, you know, see now, it was so much for Afterthought, but I was going to say, you know, I should have posted, yeah, Rob, I need to borrow like $500 because I spent too much money on this.
But instead, no, I didn't do that.
Oh, you're so kind.
And he saw right through because he knew me better.
He knew that I'd buy a DDR machine before I'd buy a nice car, so.
Yeah.
I got you.
I try.
I'm fucking great.
Okay, so... Any other of my news you can think of?
Ultramix.
Is there new news on Ultramix?
Uh, no.
Well, thanks!
Bravo!
It's just out there in limbo.
Um... Shit.
Um... Not really anything else.
Um... Well, there's sim news, I guess.
Oh, what about Tournament Explore?
Tournament Explore has been announced.
It's gonna be on June 15th.
That's all.
That's all I've got.
It's just a date.
Just June 15th.
And, um... And, uh...
Oh yeah, we were still going to be doing a TV show DWI contest, but we got lazy and haven't really planned for it yet.
So look for a big announcement at B3.
Okay, that'll give us enough time.
Yes, yes, look for that.
That'll give us plenty of time to get up off our ass and do something.
There's also, well, a couple things.
Bomani Style, they've opened up, well, they're going to be opening up, I haven't gotten my email yet, but opening up a leech server for all those who contributed to them, which I did, so I will get access to a leech server with a bunch of cool shit on it.
Ooh, you're special.
I know I am.
And then there's also, let's see, this guy Shuey, who I've been working with, he's
He's starting a project called, um, was it the DWI History Project or whatever?
Anyways, he has up-to-date every single sim file that's ever been made.
Pretty much.
Another question coming from the chatroom from Skyline.
Are we going to E3?
Probably not.
Unless someone gives us tickets really fast.
I've been asking that in, um... I can get the time off work in a... in Jiffy, but... I've been asking that, um, but I don't know.
Uh...
I don't know.
I have tickets for The Matrix Reloaded that day, so it's a gimme.
I was like, I want to see The Matrix.
I don't know.
To be honest, I don't think I have the money to go to E3, but I would like to anyway.
I do.
I want to go.
I would fucking blow someone to go to E3.
What?
Let's go hang out on the street.
I'll come up with tickets pretty quick.
Let's go hang out on the street corner in front of E3 and see if we can't get in.
Okay.
We can film it and do wacky shit and disguise ourselves like stuff.
Hey, we're the wacky media.
We can pretend we're bums and then the bum fight people will pay us to beat each other up and then I'll kick your ass.
It'll be fine.
And you know, someone with some kind of military-based first-person shooter is bound to be there.
We can dress Rob up like a booth babe.
I can be Riku.
With all the military games, just dress in camel and walk right in like you're part of the show.
Okay, we want to do a list list pretty soon here, but we need time to think about it.
Yeah, we need to do FU's of the week still, and we need to do the cage match.
So, what first?
FU's or cage match?
FU's.
FU's, alright, fine.
We're going to go to a quick break, and we'll come back and do the FU's of the week.
Okay, kids?
So, you can send them over a private message to moi, my name is Sky, hi, and I'm in the chat room.
Sky High, very cute.
I'm in the chat room and send me your FUs of the week over private message and we'll get to those right when we come back.
In the meantime, here's that new special little paranoia that's going to be in Max 2, or so they say, the Japanese home release.
Coming out this week, this is Paranoia Sur... And I have it on order too, with the VRare soundtrack.
Yay!
Here's a cookie.
Yay!
Here's Paranoia Survivor.
Enjoy.
Orange Lounge Radio.
We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
Alright kids, here we go.
As promised.
Wait for it.
Wait for it.
My fucking leak goes to Squeenix.
Damn you, Square Enix, whatever the fuck you're calling yourself.
I call you Squeenix because you suck.
Fuck you for not listening to me and for not listening to Michelle because we had this discussion earlier today.
Damn you for sucking so bad.
For not making Kingdom Hearts the way we want you to.
First of all, thank you for waiting until 2004 to release Kingdom Hearts 2.
Bitches.
Bitches.
Damn you for not taking advantage of your other licensing.
And I can tell you this right now, that if you do not take advantage of the Enix Association and go and bust some new characters on Kingdom Hearts 2, I will personally go to Tokyo in a tank and run you all over.
I will put collars on your necks and enact Battle Royale, and then whoever wins the Battle Royale...
I'll go, okay, you can go.
We'll take the collar off and then I'll stick a knife in your head.
Gosh, Jamie, you're really mean.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no.
Before I put the knife in their head, I'll shave their balls with a cheese grater and pour alcohol on it.
She's productive, okay?
I get results.
Yes.
That's right.
And then once I... You'll feed them the flake first.
And then I'll make them drink down the alcohol with the blood mixed in it afterwards.
Gosh, Jamie, you're a real bitch.
Not wasting anything.
Not wasting one thing.
They're drinking the alcohol that has the blood and the, like, sequestering.
And then once I've taken over Squeenix, first of all, I'm going to give it a cool name.
It'll be called Cute.
How about Spike?
It'll be called...
It'll be called Not Squeamix, how's that?
And then once I've taken it over, I'm going to make my own freaking RPG Because I'm going to take advantage of all those licenses And because of the association with Sony, Sony's got their fingers in everything I'm going to have the ultimate RPG I can think of one thing they don't have their fingers in I'm just saying
And then, and then, and then I'm going to make my own gaming system because nothing that's out right now will be able to use it.
And then I'm going to take over Gravity and make Ragnarok Online cool.
I'm not making an Xbox.
Fuck you all, we're making it for our system, you can't have it unless you buy our expensive system.
All I heard Jamie say was I'm taking over Gravity.
Like, now she's taking on the force.
Mother Nature, burn!
Yeah, fuck you, Nature.
I'm rewriting physics, dammit.
I've got the Moldyver power.
Anyway.
My next fuck you of the week goes toward this troll who was on the road behind me.
There's more?
There's more.
This... And again, and again... Again, I'm not a shallow person, usually.
This person made me think that Trogdor was gorgeous.
This person, this person made Corky in the Wonder Years.
You mean Life Goes On.
Life Goes On.
Looked like a beauty queen.
I miss America.
And then this bitch.
What?
Decides to tailgate me.
Chewing gum.
Going from my apartment to Harrow's.
and then gets in the other lane like, y'all, I'm gonna pass her?
So, I start going, when she's right behind me, I start going 5 miles an hour on girls.
She speeds up, I go, 50!
I was like, bless you, car, for having some acceleration this time.
Let's hear it for High Octane Gas.
My other fuck you of the week goes toward not having money.
Until after I work some more.
There's more?
Oh, bye!
Ow!
We wouldn't have Fuck You's of the Week if it weren't for me.
I'm teasing, I'm teasing.
It goes to not having money, so I couldn't go to Sakura Lattery yesterday.
It's my birthday, like I do every year except for last year because I went to Alabama instead.
However, I did get lots of meat and stuff.
And ice cream.
Lots and lots of ice cream.
Yay!
Yes, and then, um...
My other fuck you, Lalique Guess we're not having any more fuck yous, aha!
There's more?
Oh wait, there's not anymore?
Fuck you, Squeenix Fuck you and your ear, cause your ass ain't good enough Actually, their ear's not even good enough Fuck you and someone else's orifice On that note, Loki, what do you have to say?
Alright, the first one
The first fuck you is going to be going to America.
Okay?
Well, let's just...
Thank you, America, for leaving, letting Carmen Rasputin fucking stay on American Idol.
God damn it, she sounds like a fucking goat.
Okay, do you like goat music?
Do you like goat music?
Fuck, seriously, they must... Hold on.
Stop the presses.
Stop the presses.
This is the one thing I never, ever, ever, ever expected Loki to be ranting about.
Ever.
This is great.
This is a moment in Orange Lounge history.
Start your recorders.
Hey, you are recording this.
I want a copy.
I want my AOL to start with Fuck You to American Idol in his voice.
The MP3 and the DWI come out later this week.
Anyway, resume.
Alright, we'll do another thing recording.
Thank you for making me snort my Propel.
Fuck you, American Idol.
No, actually, fuck you people that voted for Carmen.
What the hell?
Two weeks in the fucking row.
You fucking vote off other good people, leave her on there.
What, you think you're going to get laid by her or something?
Our chat room is just going off.
They all agree with you.
Goddamn, that stupid bitch!
I knew y'all were in the American Idol closet.
I was so, I was so wishing... I mean, I didn't like, you know, Ricky that much, and I didn't like, you know, whoever her name was.
Julia D'Amato ruined Flashdance.
She must die.
Man, but...
I swear, what was she singing the other day?
I don't remember what it was, but it sounded like... It's just like... Yeah, seriously.
If you want to sing like a fucking country star, there's another channel for you with this stupid country version of American Idol.
Go there and get out of American Idol.
Because you're going to lose anyway to fucking Ruben.
Ruben's going to kick your ass.
I have a special message to Michelle.
That boy is mine, you stay away.
Alright.
Resume.
Alright, and now another FDU2 fucking roulette on DDR Extreme.
How you mock me?
Dammit, giving me fucking Crash and then Sakura after I played Sakura.
I hate you.
Stupid, and you taunt me with your goddamn getting on Legend of Max and then moving down.
Moving down, moving down.
You better watch out, Rob.
Up, down, fucking A. Um, I've gotten Legend of Max four times in a row.
Not even gonna do it, because I will end up killing him.
Someone get him a cookie!
No, but seriously, I hate that fucking machine, and it sucks ass.
Also, FU to the fuck- But I thought Cutie Chaser was your favorite song.
Oh, it was my favorite song until I started getting crashed all the time.
Crash, and I'm gonna get ya.
I'm gonna get- Yeah, no.
Sorry.
I don't like that song anymore either.
It's like, it gives me all the songs that people don't play.
Hmm, let's see, what song sucks?
Let's give him back.
Okay.
But no, um...
Also, uh, Nephew to the DDR Max 2 machine that was at Scandi because your arrow was broken and, yeah, and they turned off, but, I'm sorry.
Um, Nephew to the stupid drivers, stupid people, and... I don't know.
Nephew is back and my turntables haven't gotten here yet because this stupid guy slacked off on sending them to me because he sucks.
And, um...
Yeah, that's it.
I'm done for now.
I would just like to take this moment to read.
I'm looking at one page of our chat room.
Here we go.
Just some random lines here.
Dude, Rob, you can have Jim Barraros, but I want Clay.
But Clay is humble pie.
Let the black win, dammit.
STFU, Ruben is cool.
But I think Clay is gay anyway.
We've turned into Channel Pound American Idol.
Congratulations.
Actually, okay.
Thank you, Loki.
Clay can sing, but he can't perform, okay?
No, no, this is not American Idol chat.
This is the episode of the week.
I'm going to do my Carmen one more time.
Ready?
Ready?
God bless the USA!
That's another thing.
Another thing about American Idol.
Fucking A, if you sing God bless USA one more time, I hope they fucking bomb your ass.
Because seriously, how many times do you sell out about these stupid shows?
And another F you that's stupid reality TV with the goddamn Mr. Personality.
Yeah, let's get Mrs. Personality on there, Monica Lewinsky.
Yeah, she doesn't judge people before she goes down on them.
Fucking lame bitch, and then they give her own joke.
She's a nobody.
She sucks some guy's dick.
She designs purses.
Oh, whoop-dee-doo, she designs purses.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Seriously, she sucks ass and shouldn't be on here.
This is the sound of Monica Lewinsky sucking shit.
I mean, what's she gonna do?
Pull all the runners up, get my special treatment.
Yeah.
Okay, anyways, I'm done.
Alright, my turn?
That was beautiful.
It's my turn?
My FU of the week.
That moves me to, you know, gastric movement.
Thank you.
My FU of the week.
My FU of the week goes to Madonna.
Because Madonna...
You bitch.
That new video you have for American Life sucks my balls.
It is the worst, most unimaginative thing I've ever seen in my life.
Your original video was better.
Way, way better.
You know, it wasn't the best video you've done, but it was way better than that piece of shit you put on VH1.
You know, if you didn't want to ruffle feathers with the whole anti-war thing, even though the video isn't anti-war, it's all like tongue-in-cheek anyway.
Just spend $50 at least to make a decent video.
I did college projects that were better than that shit.
Madonna, you suck.
But the album comes out Tuesday and I'm buying it anyway.
Alright, my other FU of the week goes to Muheimer because he says that Kimberly Locke sucks and Kimberly Locke is a goddess.
Fuck you.
Shut up.
Jamie has another one.
Okay, yes.
Fuck all of you people for watching TV and having rotten minds who only focus on that one tube that puts the picture forth, that your brains are attached to, and your whole life depends on, and you have no social... I have no idea what you're talking about.
Next.
Don't you do that when you play, um, when you're not playing, but it's not a fast game or not a fast game?
All right.
for being easy.
Oh my god.
Let's move on to the rest of the room chat room.
Or the rest of the room FU.
Zero!
Oh no, it's really cool.
I have like a Madonna FU too.
Okay.
No, today I was watching television.
And anyways, they were talking about how she's trying to make an effort against... Okay, but TV.
Anyways, yeah, like I was trying to say as she hops out of the room.
She's trying to combat music piracy also.
She had a bunch of people get online, and she has her actual voice, where, like, you'll download the full length of the song, right?
But it'll just start off, like, the first six seconds is the only thing.
It'll say, what the fuck do you think you're doing?
That was fucking great, actually.
It's funny, but it's like...
You really think you're going to do something.
You know, it's not the only one doing that, though.
I tried to download the new Jewel single, Don't Ask Me Why, I just was, and it did the same thing.
Well, if she wasn't going, what the fuck are you looking at?
It just looped the chorus over and over, and I got no doubts on that did that.
People are doing that, all the stuff.
Yeah, you know what?
That's not going to stop anything.
You can do whatever.
Good luck, RIAA.
You suck.
You're never going to fucking stop us from pirating your music.
I laugh at you wasting billions of dollars trying to try.
Go ahead.
We'll just go out and find a way around that.
You go, boy.
Zero.
It's not very hard.
No, um, another one, I gotta give an F you to my fucking computer.
No, fuck you to cable, having a cable modem.
I have to burn a fucking CD every goddamn day.
Cause like, first of all, my fucking computer is a piece of shit and has a small hard drive.
I fill it up with music, like, every day.
I don't have the money for a new fucking hard drive.
I don't have the money for that yet, so I get a job.
Wait, I have a job, I start tomorrow, alright.
But anyways, like, I have to burn a CD, I'm already out of fucking CDs because fucking music is too damn good.
Yeah, and, um, fuck you to, uh, who the fuck is that?
Some stupid bitch yesterday, um, I was, like, walking over to the store, this is in the afternoon, and some stupid bitch at the fucking crosswalk just walks into me!
No fucking reason, this is like...
I'm standing there, I'm pushing the button, that's right, because I was going to get a calling card to call my friend in another country.
And this fucking bitch crosses the street, and, like, I'm not standing on the corner, and she, like, just runs into me and knocks me into the fucking pole.
And I looked at her, and I looked at her, and she, like, said, what the fuck's your problem?
I said, I didn't believe you just made up these names.
I just explained the whole story.
I was sitting there, and some stupid ChronoCore bitch came and ran into me, knocked me into the bowl on the corner when I was walking up to get a calling card, and she said that, you know, I was a bitch, and she said she was gonna cut me.
Because I called her ChronoCore.
But anyways, that's all my FUs, because that was fucking stupid.
And fuck even not having any more FUs.
Alright.
Does, um, does Jim have any FUs?
Yeah.
Alright, skip Jim for a second.
Let's go to Irene.
Irene.
He's disgruntled, so yeah, there's gonna be a lot of him.
Oh, I love this song.
Fuck this song.
Fuck you to guys that, like, stare at girls and, you know, oogle at girls, like, in front of their girlfriends, like, and make silly remarks and stuff, like...
Um, well, maybe I should finish this before Brad gets here, you know, yeah.
And, like, you know, you gotta like a band for more than, you know, just what some chick wears, you know, some stupid corseter.
Oh, yeah, that too.
I like Switzerland.
Isn't Switzerland a great country?
Don't you like Switzerland?
Shut up!
This is my F.U. !
Okay, Zero, give the FUs for somebody else.
Okay, this is kind of like a battle FU between them, but, like, Dark Child, first off, he says, fuck you to loud-ass bass at 3 o'clock in the morning as he's trying to sleep.
Um, I guess apparently, um, Bombay was playing his music a little bit too loud at 3 o'clock in the morning.
Kiss, kiss.
Yes, well, yeah, that's right, we need to get him some boxes, huh?
No, seriously, I'll come over this week and pack a cell phone for you.
Can you put it on the driveway?
Switzerland's a great place.
Wait, we can do the whole Strong Bad thing.
Maybe we should put your stereo on the street and find more stuff you'd like to give to me.
I mean, the people.
I'll put you in the driveway back over it, except I don't want all that stuff to get in my wheels.
Okay, but anyways, yeah, back to that, yeah.
He got pretty pissed off.
And he said that, like, if he wasn't, um, if he wasn't so tired, he would've got up and, like, beat some ass.
I wish he was awake.
Um, and then he says, fuck you to 80s... Hold on!
Damn, fucking 80s, all of a sudden everyone fucks around and gets pissed off.
What?!
Fuck everyone.
No, he says, fuck you to 80s... What you talking about, Zero? 80...
Oh my god.
Fuck you!
I heard that shit.
No, um, he said, um, fuck you to 80s techno beats and shit because they're all repetitive and looping, and he says they suck ass.
And then, and then the one from DD Alcoholic, she decides to say fuck you to Darkchild because she thinks 80s techno is good.
Anita's a goddess, what can I say?
Yeah, but I kind of wish that Dark Child was awake in the middle of the night because that would have been funny to hear at 3.30 in the morning he gets up and runs out to, like, kill somebody for techno.
That'd be cool.
Rawr.
Yeah, I'm done.
Speaking of the 80s, and back sort of reminding me of the conversation from earlier, fuck you to Captain N, the Game Master.
Holy shit, I downloaded a bunch of episodes.
That show sucked ass.
That show was the worst ever, because... And skewed so many of my viewpoints in video game history.
Simon was a lot more, like, ballsy-er than they made him to be.
But yeah, fuck that show.
I just had a memory of that show.
Anyway, I'm going to start following things.
I don't know.
I'm kind of vague on my FUs, really.
Can't think of many particular things, but... Shit.
I don't know.
FU, really, to... Hey, you mentioned reality shows and shit like that.
And so...
A fair amount of the people who actually watch that shit who, you know, seems to have no real purpose in their lives to spend hours on end in the days to watch this shit all the time.
That's what you're talking about, asshole.
I honestly can't stand this reality BS because it's not exactly reality.
I mean, I don't agree.
The reality movie, that's too much.
Exactly.
Don't even go there!
Fucking, that's the dumbest fucking thing I've ever seen!
Goddamn real world!
Die!
Dude, it went up in yellow.
That was cool.
And your face is purple.
My ears are bleeding and your face is purple, Jim.
Uh, yeah.
Um...
God, I got a scatterbrain right now.
I can't think of many FUs.
Um... This is my dark side talking.
You know, fuck you to the entire human race because, you know, you are the plague that is eating this planet alive.
Like, you know, exactly... Getting on a little Matrix feel, exactly what Agent Smith said.
We are a virus.
We are a...
Parasite to this planet.
I mean, we're pretty much just going to do that shit to every other planet we meet up in along the way.
But, yeah, that's it.
All right.
Chatroom FUs.
Fuck the chatroom FUs.
DDR Angel.
My first FU goes to those stupid people, companies, whatever, that send you those damn text messages to your phone wanting you to buy their shit.
I don't care.
I don't need your crap.
And stop wasting my monthly 200 text messages there for my friends and not you.
Grr.
FU to my work schedule because I'm going to miss a lot of Orange Ons Radio this week.
FU to that.
You know what?
You can just get free text messaging like I have.
I would also recommend suing the companies that are sending that shit to you.
You can.
John Fields says, F you to people calling me a cult leader and trying to sue me for killing someone when that person is still alive and they know that person is alive.
Huh?
That was scary.
I'd like to be a cult leader.
Wait, F you to that person who caused it by faking their own death to get off the net.
Wow.
Wow.
One more, F you to not being able to DDR more than one game because of not having enough energy even after a full night of sleep.
Wait, let me go back to this.
Somebody faked their own death on the internet, and then this guy, our guy in the chatroom, Jon Fields, gets blamed as being a cult leader and gets sued for killing that person.
Okay, first of all... How the hell did that happen?
First of all, the whole faking your whole death thing on the internet, if anyone falls for that bullshit, they're so stupid.
You know?
I've had people try to pull that stuff and then I just traced their IP and found other places that they're posting.
That is so weird.
Wow.
That's so stupid.
As the internet turns, as the world wide web turns.
Alright, ViolentHyperGirl would like to give a big FU to AP practice exams and bitchy club advisors.
Another FU to the MilpitasGolfLand AZN idiots who think they're good and then run away from the machine when I start freestyling.
Moohimer would like to say, fuck stupid friends again.
Fuck almost going to Ocean City to play DDR, but then my parents are being like, uh, no, but I'm going Tuesday anyway.
You know what's funny?
Ocean City is that town, you ever drive through Sacramento and it's like where Highway 50 starts, and they have like, oh, Sacramento's this far away, and Lake Tahoe's this far away, and then Ocean City, Maryland is this far away, because that's where Highway 50 ends.
Isn't that funny?
I don't know.
I thought it was funny, I don't know.
Well, Rob!
Fuck online games for being so addicting, although I must say, SissyFight.com is strangely fun.
I have to visit that site.
Fuck bag in the background.
Eh, whatever.
Hey, I picked that too.
DarkTetsuya would like to give an F you to all the spam I've been getting lately.
Build a sculpture.
Um, that's why you block it.
F you to QDChaser's heavy steps on the extreme not matching DDR Max's USAs.
Skyline would like to say a big F you to boring eventless spring breaks.
Now I'm fat again.
Oh, poor baby.
Stop watching reality TV and go play some DDR.
Fraternity life sucks also.
I'd just like you to know.
If someone hates reality TV, you're watching an awful lot of it.
I was bored yesterday.
It was all I was on.
I was waiting for a show I'll talk about later.
Anyway, Japan Man would like to say fuck me for forgetting the show.
That is all.
Yeah, fuck you!
Yeah, fuck you!
No, just kidding, it's cool.
It happens.
Fuck you, man!
I almost forgot the show today.
Japan Man would also like to say, Fuck certain people that make fun of me when I fail on Bag, and I'm 50 times better than them.
Fuck memories on Naoki Neo Standard.
It's a bitch, but I finally beat it.
Woo!
And, uh, what the fuck?
Fuck the test our state makes us take every fucking year.
Die.
That was so Jimmy.
It's alright.
Bryce, RYC3, that's why I said it, so Jimmy.
RYC3 would like to say, fuck you dumb fucks in SoCal, guys, who have no chance on getting with the girls they want to get with, then later crying over it to me because they got rejected.
Fuck you to being single.
Amen.
Fuck you to kids, preteens at work, testing my patience in the counter, giving prizes for tickets.
23rd Magus would like to say, here's my big old list.
F you to Kentucky.
F you to spending a week in Kentucky.
F you to the flight to Kentucky.
F you to turbulence on the flight back to Kentucky.
F you to having to leech money off mom to buy Angel a ring in Kentucky.
Hands Angel a ring.
F you to getting mom's IP banned from DJ Bad while I was in Kentucky.
F you to missing Orange Lounge while I was in Kentucky.
F you to having nothing to do in Kentucky, but pretty much F you to Kentucky.
Zing.
Yeah, I would have said F you to Kentucky.
I want to know if you brought back chicken.
MoreThanJake543, F you to boring breaks, false hope, sporks not being made out of metal.
That's a good one.
People who think punk is fashion, and when you send your F you's to the wrong person.
and the fact that I lost my Battle Royale in my hard drive crash of last week.
Oh yes, F you to American Idol.
I can replace that.
You know what, actually, I need to throw in one more fuck you.
Fuck you to 800 megabyte, um, uh, BenQ files that I don't have the disks that are capable of burning Battle Royale to right now.
Zip them up?
Does it work?
No, it's the file to burn to BenQ.
And I can't copy the file off.
That's weird.
You know, they do have things to rip being Q files.
I'm talking about that.
I'm talking about the file itself being too big to burn to a CD.
Vid Powwow would like to say, F you to school.
I don't want to go back after vacation.
And F you to myself for bringing all the things needed to play 2DX at a party.
Except the controller!
That was funny.
Who was that?
Vid Powwow.
Teehee.
ElectroTal, our old friend, that would like to say F you to whoever fucked up Sakpamani.
Well, that would be our good friends at $1hosting.com.
Yes, fuck them and fuck DuploWeb for going away, and fuck WebCountry, who owns $1hosting.
So look for the coming of Sakpamani.org.
With a subdomain, cybermoney.org, fuck you.
I don't know.
Fuck you and bellarhosting.com.
Sounds good to me.
ViolentHypergold gives one last FU.
FU to my stupid computer that likes to reset itself for no apparent reason.
It's not even an old computer.
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the one hour long FUs of the week.
Congratulations.
Yay.
Yay.
You know why your computer resets?
Why?
Because probably your fan on your heat sink is dirty and your computer's overheating.
Check that.
No, seriously, Punk Knight's computer used to do that reset for no reason.
We found out that his fan was jammed from moving by a bunch of dust.
So, yeah.
How about we do the cage match now?
The system is down.
Let's do the cage match now.
That'll be fun.
Okay.
That'll be a fun one.
This'll be fun.
And then while we're compiling those, we can do Son of a Bitch after that.
Yeah, so I'm giving us time to do listless while the cage match songs are playing.
I'll start handing out paper.
Sounds like a good idea.
Okay, so, hold on, I'm bringing up cage match.
Yeah, so hi, how was your week?
While I get my music.
My week was unemployed.
I didn't sleep most of the week.
How many fuck-off shows did you do this week?
One.
Only one?
No, I may have done two.
Maybe two.
I'm going to be doing a fuck-off show, though, on Tuesday night, I'm sure.
Cool.
Good job.
Yeah, that's one reason you've got to listen to Orange Lounge Radio all the time.
Our Bumani Music War Program gives the surprises.
I've got a tonight.
Not bad, not bad.
That's more than we get on some of these shows.
Yeah, and I had nine listeners at 7 a.m.
one day.
Which for internet radio is amazingly good.
Because I did a fuck-off show from 11.30 p.m.
until 8 in the morning.
So are we ever going to be featured on Satellite Radio?
Yeah, that's what I want to know.
I still say we need to get on G4.
With some of the crap they have on there, Orange Lounge would fit right in.
All right.
Cool.
Let's go to this week's Cage Max, shall we, ladies and gents?
I just called it Cage Max.
Max!
Help me.
Okay, here we go with tonight's Cage Max.
Last week... Boys and girls.
No.
Okay, hi.
Last week in the cage match, Loki won it with a song called Duck Toy by Hampenberg.
And here is a clip.
The way the cage match works, you can vote for either Loki's song, DarkSakura's song, or my song.
And the winning song gets to go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.
Except Duck Toy never went into rotation because I never got a copy of the MP3.
Oops.
Oh well.
So...
Here it is, though, one more time for you.
It could still win tonight if you want to vote for it.
The first entry in tonight's cage match.
Here's a clip of Hamperberg with DuckToy.
Thanks for watching!
All right.
That was Hamperberg with Duck Toy.
That was last week's winner in Orange Lounge Radio's cage match.
You can vote for that.
That's the first song.
or you can vote for my pick this week.
I promised Irene like four weeks ago I'd do this song and I didn't because I kept finding better stuff like Freeze Pop.
You know what?
I'll put in Super Spro tonight.
I will.
Don't push me.
All right.
No, I want to do a different artist tonight.
You should at least be happy you won that game.
Yeah, that was funny.
It was only because we got into a fight on air, but that was cool.
Anyway, okay, my pick tonight is actually a band I put in the cage match like way, like probably the first or second cage match I put this band in, and they lost.
But that's okay because they're going to win tonight, right?
This band is called Olive, and they're a cool little trip-hop band from a few years ago.
They were big a couple years ago.
I don't know if they're still around.
Are they still around, Irene?
You're the one that made me put this song in.
All right, whatever.
Actually, no, I think they do still do stuff recently, because I think this song was on the Next Best Thing soundtrack.
That's where it came from.
This song is called, it's a cover of an old 70s song, and it's called I'm Not In Love.
So enjoy.
This song is cool.
I'm not in love, so don't forget it It's just a silly thing I'm going through
and just because
Thanks for watching!
Oopies!
Oopies!
I ended that one a little soon.
That's alright.
That was the end.
Those last ten seconds of it.
That was Olive with I'm... That was Olive with I'm Not In Love.
What did you kids think of that one?
I wasn't really listening.
I'm not in love I'm not in love with that song You're so punny No, I'm really not, that was the worst song ever That was almost as bad as Freeze Pod
I give it a two, because it sucks.
You bitch.
It sucks!
You're never going to like a song I put in Cage Match.
You could die.
Yeah, but I won one for you, didn't I?
Whatever.
Okay, fine.
You didn't win that week either.
You lost, if it wasn't for me and Tile fighting.
You suck.
Tim, what did you think?
One to ten scale.
I don't like it that much.
What do you give it?
On a 1 to a 10.
Will you stop that?
Stop it!
I will decide my own.
I will give it a... It's a decent song, actually.
Some might actually pick, but I have to say I'd give it probably a 4.
4 or 5.
Wonderful.
Irene, what did you think?
Well, I know who picked it, so...
I give it a 9.9 because it's sexy but not as sexy as me.
Do you know who I am?
Sorry, I should have said not as sexy as Dr. J. Alright, one more pick for this week's cage match and it comes from Miss Dark Sakura.
What is it?
This was a song that I, I don't, I was like, oh my god, I need a song, I'll pick this one.
But I really like it.
What's it called?
Phantom of the Opera something or the other remix, I don't know.
Alright, this is a Phantom of the Opera something or other remix, enjoy.
Hi, we're back.
That was the Phantom of the Opera techno remix.
Going around the room, what did you think, Jamie?
Well, I could have found better if I had tried, so I give it an eight and a half.
Zero?
Okay, I absolutely love the finale of the opera, but I really like the original a lot more than that.
And so, even though it was a good remix, uh, technomics of it, I'll give it, like, an eight, because it was still pretty decent, even though it could have been better.
Thank you, what'd you think?
Uh, I heard this a long ass time ago, way before I started doing this show.
That's how old it is.
Oh, food!
You went to McDonald's instead?
Keep going, keep going, keep going.
Oh, I don't give a shit.
If you got me the two cheeseburger meal with super size, I love you.
I give it an 8, but vote for my song.
Um, I thought it was, it was pretty decent.
It was, it was a decent mix.
Um, I'll give it, uh, 8.
I can totally see that mix in DDR.
Okay, so, really quick, you guys, here's clips of the three songs you can vote for tonight.
First one, last week's winner, Hamperberg with Duck Toy.
Don't vote for that one.
Vote for someone else's.
Vote for Rob's.
You can vote for Olive with I'm Not In Love.
Or you can vote for Phantom of the Opera, The Technomix.
Thank you for watching!
You've won, like, what, one?
Yeah.
You can vote for me as a pity.
You deserve to win one.
All votes for DuckToy go to Rob.
Because I don't want that song to win.
Alright.
Usually we don't go to a musical break right after Cage Match, but there's a little chaotic because we just had food brought into the room, so people are scrounging for food.
So we're going to take a quickie, quickie break.
and we will be right back.
And we're going to have tonight's list list when we get back.
So, we're going to go to a song that I think Jamie likes a lot this week because you had a good accomplishment with this song this week.
Okay, we're going to hear the long version of Last Message.
I want the breasts to come... Oh, sorry.
Pfft.
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!
I'm singing all you love No matter where you may be My thoughts will travel to you Cause I need my message
Thank you for watching!
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
Do you want to be accepted by Hollywood?
No!
Do we care what people think of us?
No!
Do we want people to kiss our ass?
Yes!
Extreme Bomani Radio.
That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
We are back, ladies and gentlemen, and I have tonight's winner of the cage match.
And by an amazing one vote, one vote margin, made this song win.
Tonight's cage match winner is... DuckToy!
DuckToy!
Why?
I tell you not to and you do.
You bastards.
That's it.
You're on the list.
By one vote over Phantom of the Opera.
One vote.
Doesn't that mean... If the one person who voted for Olive would have voted the other way around.
Only one person voted for Olive.
Do not speak of the English.
I said don't vote for the damn song.
Because I have something better next week.
Which is funny because I could swear that the one person who voted for my song was also the one person who was hating on it in the chat room.
Rob wins.
So, Loki, congratulations, you win once again.
However, I guess since Jamie did this a few weeks back, we will extend the same offer to you.
You can pull the song Voluntary out next week and put in your own new song.
Because we let Jamie do that with the Zelda thing, right?
Yeah.
So, only to be fair.
Now, I have, this is my new project thing I want to, I say us as Americans should push this.
Get rid of reality TV and instead put Japanese game shows.
Yeah!
Why?
Why?
The greatest thing has happened yesterday, okay?
TNN has brought this new show.
Well, it's kind of an old Japanese TV show where they basically torture these people.
Anyways, and they make them do ridiculous challenges.
And the show's called Most Extreme Elimination Challenge.
It's the greatest show ever and...
Because it's all in Japanese, they have these people dubbing over the voices and making them sound really goofy and stupid.
And it's that much better.
It is the greatest show on Earth.
It would beat out any reality show.
Fuck that.
This is the best shit ever, okay?
This is the best fucking... This is what game shows should aspire to be, okay?
I mean, Price is Right is good, but nowhere... It does not come anywhere near this damn show.
Best show ever.
Speaking of reality shows, did you see any previews lately for that new Spring Break reality movie that's coming out?
I already fucking talked about that!
Okay, that fucking black guy in his fucking Speedo, he can die.
Yeah, this is a great idea.
Let's take non-actors, give them no script, and just have them go wild on Spring Break.
And we'll film it and call it a movie.
Fuck that.
I can go around yelling at people.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Speaking of reality TV, I watched something that Islander had.
The Blind Date DVD.
The Uncensored Blind Date DVD.
Well, this one was great.
I mean, besides, though, all the boobs and cock there was all over the place, they showed this one person who, like, by the end of the day, they were, like, already all over each other the whole date.
It was funny.
Like, they just met the first day.
Yeah, she, without her, she unbuttoned her sweater.
It was, it was just, like...
I was like, these are your first dates.
What's wrong with you stupid people?
By the way, boys and girls, Orange Lounge, the motion picture, comes out at the end of the year.
No, it doesn't.
And that's all it is, is a moving picture.
Yeah, it comes out and then it goes back in.
Stupid MTV with their stupid reality shows.
Fraternity Life and Sorority Life are being filmed at the same time.
One falls, obviously, the sorority, and the other one the fraternity, and their rival fraternity, sorority things.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I asked for a big and tasty with no meat.
I asked for a big and tasty with no meat.
I got a piece of bread, some onions, and a tomato.
Beautiful.
You know why?
You need to go to BK because they have the veggie burger there.
It's pretty decent.
Pretty decent.
We need to do listless.
Yes, we do need to do listless.
There was one other thing I was thinking of that I wanted to bring up before.
But you forgot, so let's do listless.
All right.
But I forgot, so let's do listless.
I'm a scat man!
It is time, once again, for Orange Lounge Radio's Listless!
Alright.
It's, um... Listless.
Yes.
It's inspired by an old television show that used to be on VH1.
Not stolen from, but inspired by.
Alright.
Tonight's topic...
Jamie is here to explain tonight's topic.
I am?
Oh.
Yes.
Tonight's topic is Chicken McNugget.
No.
This, again, is back on the Kingdom Hearts theme.
It is what world is associated with Disney, Miramax, Enix, or Square?
ABC.
Enix.
Enix.
Squeenix.
Squeenix, yes.
Squeenix.
or for Loki, Squamous.
Would you like to see in the next Kingdom Hearts game?
All right, so what world would you like to... Oh, I'm sorry.
What world would you like to see in the new Kingdom Hearts game?
All right.
Alright, here we go.
Who's starting?
Wait, who's participating?
Show of hands.
This whole thing?
You guys are at McDonald's, sorry.
Okay, Jamie's first.
Yes, Jamie.
My number three would be Chrono Trigger slash Chrono Cross.
Alright, so Jamie says Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross.
Any particular reason?
You want to say any of the reasons why?
First of all, I think Michelle would kill me.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
It would be funny to see Chasing Daisy.
Chasing Daisy?
I know, but if you wanted to mix it, it would be Chasing Amy, but you just call it Chasing Daisy.
Any particular reason why we want this Chasing Amy slash Chasing Daisy thing?
It would be funny to see Mickey, Donald, and Goofy going after a lesbian.
You just want Daisy Duck to be a dyke.
Because she'll want Middy.
Dude, this burger's rare.
What's a Nubian?
Look at this.
The burger is pink.
Shut the fuck up.
The burger's raw.
I'm going to eat it and get poisoned.
Is Jim... What was your online name again?
I'm sorry.
Geist.
That's not my online name.
It's just kind of a handle of mine.
Geist.
Okay, Geist.
Kind of serious.
In the style of Final Fighting Fantasy, actually.
Any Final Fantasy?
No, Final Fighting Fantasy, Final Flash.
Ah, okay.
Yeah.
Final Fighting Fantasy.
For those of you who don't know what Final Fighting Fantasy is, it's basically just a combination of all the Final Fantasy worlds with basically all the storylines intact, like...
Whatever characters died in the games are still dead and various other things like that.
First of all, they already have 7 and 8 and 10 involved in Kingdom Hearts already.
Well, you can combine the others.
No, but we're actually picking established individual worlds.
Well, basically involving 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 as well.
Well, that's the thing with this thing.
It's like a saga created to combine all those worlds into one.
Huh?
Well, it's based off of square characters, though.
Alright.
Final Fighting Fantasy.
Alright.
Alright, for those who may not have heard of it, there's your explanation.
Let's go on.
Loki, your number three pick.
I'm gonna rain on someone's parade here, but Xenogears or Xenosaga Xenogears or Xenosaga, you gotta pick one Xenogears is fucking, well Xenogears is only, same fucking universe Alright, alright Any other particular reason why?
Because that game rocks.
It has giant robots to smash down Mickey because he sucks and he's gay.
All right, Irene.
Your pick.
Well, I'm incorporating both Anita and Jason's picks.
So our number three is Star Ocean.
Star Ocean.
Yeah.
I've never played it, but they said it, so I don't know.
All right.
Since we can pick anything, you know, Miramax, any of that, because they all are owned by the same group, my number three was Pulp Fiction Land.
Yeah.
That would be funny.
Here's the Keyblade.
I had it up my ass.
Give me back my Keyblade.
Which Keyblade is it?
It's the one that says Bam-a-da-fuck-a on it.
Lord will strike down upon thee with great vengeance.
All right.
They'll call the Keyblade here.
You know what they call it?
Alright.
Lead Blade Royale.
With cheese.
Lead Battle Royale.
Lead Battle Royale.
Yes.
Jamie, your number two pick?
My number two pick is Bustin' Move and Bustin' 2.
Because I want heat in my party.
To dance.
And set people on fire.
Alright, so you want Busta Moves so you can have heat lay down the law And no I'm not talking about Puzzle Bobble And the name Busta Groove is not really a name It's what the 989 Studios has duped you into thinking it is
All right.
Zero, your number two pick.
I think it would be cool to see the Final Fantasy... I mean, all the characters from Kingdom Hearts, like, have, like, an air guys type fighting game.
Ooh, so air guys.
I have no idea if I spelled that right, but I think I'm close.
Close enough.
Yes.
Yes.
All right, Jim.
Your number two pick.
My number two pick would have to be the best thing to come out of Disney, Gargoyles.
Gargoyles.
Very good.
All right.
I remember the old Gargoyles Quest games.
Actually, I don't think they had anything.
Did they have anything to do with the series?
No, they weren't related, were they?
All right, Gargoyles, that's a good one, all right.
Loki, your number two pick.
The best fucking game for Squaresoft.
Well, yeah, what you, the artist formerly known as Squaresoft.
Ergotts, or not Ergotts, ah, fuck, ah, no, wrong game, wrong game.
It gives it an E though, Einhander.
What one, what one?
Einhander.
Einhunter?
Einhander, meaning one-hander.
H-A-N-D-E-R.
It's a shitty game.
It's a shooter.
Alright, it's an old shooter.
We'll play Einhunder.
Alright.
Hmm, okay.
Irene, your number two pick from the little group over there?
I don't even think this is like related to Square or Disney or Miramax or anything, but...
I put Reading Rainbow.
Because I love that show so much.
Reading Rainbow.
Yeah.
So, Reading Rainbow World would be so awesome.
Well, yeah, Reading Rainbow is done by LeVar Burton, right?
Yes, with LeVar Burton.
And LeVar Burton is on Star Trek The Next Generation.
Star Trek The Next Generation was sponsored by... Give me help, sir.
Okay, I'm trying to...
Would he join your party at that point?
2 plus 2 is 4.
4 times 3 is 12.
There are 12 inches in a ruler.
Queen Elizabeth was a ruler and so on and so forth.
Yeah, anyway, so vote for Reading Rainbow.
Reading Rainbow.
I used to have the theme song.
I can't find it anymore.
Oh, well.
Butterfly in the sky.
Dark Oh yeah?
F you
Alright, my number one.
Yes, your number one, Jamie.
Because Disney now owns the rights to the dubbed version of Digimon.
So that's my pick.
Digimon.
Because Pokemon sucks ass.
Hey, I just saw Pokemon 4 this week.
It was cool.
Nerd.
And Pokemon 5 is coming out soon.
Okay, first of all, if you watch Digimon in Japanese, it doesn't suck.
I do agree the dubbed is sort of ass.
Zero, your number one pick.
Okay, I had a tough time choosing between, but since, you know, Disney owns ABC, because, you know, they're trying to be the Microsoft of television now, I had to choose.
It would either be the Drew Carey show or Whose Line Is It Anyway?
Because that would be hella funny.
That would be funny.
You have to, like, improv to make everyone laugh.
Is that your number one pick?
Son of a bitch, you took mine.
I just want to say for those who had their picks taken by somebody else, great minds think alike.
I'm not getting you in the mic.
Can you make sure it's on over there?
Hello?
Oh, there we go.
Okay, it's back.
Whatever.
That was weird.
My number one pick would have to be excluding those underdeveloped characters, unless there are some pedophiles in the audience, would have to be a Final Fantasy nudist colony.
A Final Fantasy nudist colony.
It's something anybody can like.
Well, we had to get porn in the show somehow.
Alright.
Number one.
Alright.
Number one from Loki.
Okay.
Wait a second.
Okay.
It's gonna be... Um... Horrible theme park ride turned into movieville.
Horrible theme park attraction turned into movieville because Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion, The Country Bears.
That has nothing to do with the subject of the cage match.
Sure it does.
Pirates of the Caribbean is being made of, you know, you gotta pick one.
So we're Pirates of the Caribbean?
Fine, I'll pick a goddamn universe then.
Alright, you know, let's see here, um...
Let me pull one out of my ass here.
We're going to pick... Country Bears?
No!
They're going to go to... I don't know, let's see.
How about Halloweenville?
Because, you know, the Halloween... Halloweenville's in the game, and Kingdom Hearts 1.
Halloween the fucking movieville!
God damn it, you know?
Alright, alright, alright.
Yeah, it is Miramax.
Okay, if you would.
Oh, I'd go there.
Alright.
This is D-Child, and since I'm not part of this list list, I'm just throwing one out there because I have to get this out.
Alright.
Because Kevin Smith was a whore for Miramax, I'd have to say The Quick Stop, along with James Allen Bob.
You must have them.
Yeah, I was going to say they already have...
All right, the quick stop.
All right, Irene, what's your guys' number one?
Okay, this is at Anita's suggestion.
Is it on?
Yeah, okay.
She suggested Spirited Awayville or town or something.
Because, yes, because I love Spirited Away.
That's a good one.
Spirited Away was a great film.
So, Spirited Awayland or whatever.
My number one was Whose Line Is It Anyway, but it got taken.
Bastard.
So I'm going to change.
I'm going to do a ride as well because the whole discussion about the ride got me thinking and I would love to see a spinning teacups land.
Where you just spin round and round and you're in a giant teacup.
Yeah, and then everybody vomits all over and it's just a big green pile of shit.
You should do the faulty gondola ride, Phil.
Alright, now's the part where we have to say goodbye to something that's on the list.
Here we go, Jamie.
There's a lot of these that I would take off the list because they have absolutely nothing to do with the subject of the list list, however.
Yeah, someone said Ergus.
And it's its own universe.
Alright, alright.
So, I'm going to take off Final Fighting Fantasy because that's involving multiple universes, so it's trying to combine multiple things in one, so it's cheating.
Alright, so Final Fighting Fantasy.
Alright, stop.
If it was Final Fantasy VI or Final Fantasy V, I would have agreed with it.
However, that's sort of cheating to take multiple answers in one.
Alright, so on to technicality.
There it goes.
Alright, zero.
She's going to end up punching someone over or something.
No, I would take out probably the Final Fantasy Nudist Colony.
Because I don't think it would be... You could, like, look on the internet for that.
You could look on the internet for that!
Alright, get on the internet if you want to see some nudity.
Because we know Cloud's in the gay porn, so, uh, yeah.
Alright, I don't know if you can see the list all the way back there, Jim, but is there something on here?
It's gotta go.
Uh... That's called We The Losers, isn't it?
I'm sorry, since I wasn't that big of a fan of it, I'd have to say Romy and Michelle, though.
Aw, make me cry.
Do-do-do-do, this is the dial tone, do-do-do.
Loki.
Uh, we're gonna take off, um...
Chasing Daisy.
Chasing Daisy.
You do have the quick stops a little better.
Yeah, quick stops a little better.
Alright, I agree.
Irene, what's coming down?
I think I'm going to take off the spinning teacups.
You suck.
All my pics are going.
Makes me sad.
Alright, then that leaves me.
As tempting as I am to take off Chrono Trigger, because everybody knows I think it's overrated, but no, I'm going to keep it on there because I'd get killed by so many people if I did take that off.
So... I don't know.
Um...
I guess I have to take off Halloween, Michael Myers, because it's just... They already did the Nightmare Before Christmas land.
Hellraiser versus... Hellraiser I would have let you keep, but... Alright, so now you can vote for one of these lands that should be in the next Kingdom Hearts game.
So here they are, they're in the chatroom, and Jamie's going to read them off for you.
We have Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross, we have Xenogears, Xenosaga, Star Ocean, Pulp Fiction Land...
Bust and Move World, Air Guys, Gargoyles, Einhander, Reading Rainbow, Digimon, Whose Line Is It Anyway, Quick Stop, and Spirited Away.
Vote!
You can send those votes right now over a private message to me, Sky, in the chat room.
Alright, while you guys vote, we're going to take a quick break.
And we're going to come back and just talk about... Are you ready to do a game review this week?
Alright, then Zero's game review when we come back.
That'll be fun.
Okay, so we're going to listen to some more 2DX fun stuff music.
And we'll be right back with Zero and Dark Child's game review.
Yay!
Alright, we'll be back.
Maybe don't you cry
What is this thing?
What is this thing?
What is this thing inside?
What is this thing?
What is this thing?
I thought that you were mine
Thanks for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
Well, you're just going to take a left at the Shell Station, and then you're going to go about a mile, anyway.
You're listening...
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and I bet you all want to know who won the list-less segment.
So, here we go.
The winning lands that we are going to see in Kingdom Hearts 2, if we had our way, would be, in third place, drumroll, Digimon!
Digimon Land, Digimon World.
I forgot to be specific that I was referring to Zero Two, because anything after that kind of sucks.
So, Digimon Zero Two Land.
Alright.
Number two, drumroll, is Spirited Away.
Good pick, good pick.
I like that one a lot.
Alright, and in first place, Breath of Anticipation is Gargoyles is the winner for the land you'd most like to see in Kingdom Hearts 2.
Thank God.
Which kind of Chippendales are you talking about, Loki?
Rangers, man.
Rescue Rangers.
My runner-up, though, was Duckburg.
Oh, from DuckTales?
DuckTales and Darkwing Duck.
What about freaking, um, no, Doug?
Hello?
No one said Doug?
Patty Manning!
Mozzarella has a good point.
Chip and Dale were in Kingdom Hearts 1, just not their little land.
But they were the guys on the ship, right?
Yeah, they sent out the ship.
You only saw them for like two seconds, and that was their shot.
All right.
I want to know, if it was the gummy ship, why were there no gummy bears?
Dude, that would have been cool, too.
It's a gummy bear universe.
Yeah, the gummy... Well, you were on the gummy ship, though, so you kind of had it.
It was.
Crapyship!
It was the... Hi, we're really jealous.
We have Starfox envy, so we're going to pretend to be Starfox, but not.
We suck.
So you want to have the gummy forest.
Damn you, Squeenix.
You hoped in grade for the, um, to get the damn warp drive so you didn't have to go through shooting every fucking thing.
Okay, I'm not even there yet, because I loaned you my game.
What, you mean when you travel between worlds?
I'm like right before Agrabah.
Oops.
I just beat it.
But you get the warp drive.
Give me my game back.
I want to beat the Hades Cup.
Okay, thank you.
Alright, moving on.
We're going to get to a new segment.
Brand new segment tonight.
Yay.
Brand new segment of Orange Launch Radio.
This is where some of our new regulars get to shine.
Oh my god.
It's the orgasm segment, everybody.
Holy shit.
Big orgasm, everybody.
This is the best thing in the world.
Zero and Dark Child's Video Game Reveal
Holy shit, and this is a good song to choose.
Zero and Dark Child's game review here on Orange Lounge Radio.
I think Hitmania would have just been good by itself.
No, I just busted at not seeing that manga.
And I haven't even seen the picture inside.
Alright, Jamie's showing us Battle Royale manga right now.
I'm about to take that book and drop my pants in the bathroom, okay?
Dude, I'm about to drop my pants right now.
I would Abe away.
Anyways, back to video games.
Okay, I decided to make this one not as extensive as last time.
It's just going to be a couple random games that we play throughout the week.
Number one is starting off with Midnight Club 2, which, if you haven't played it and you have a PS2, go out and rent it, or... Buy it.
Buy it.
Don't rent it.
Buy it.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Really, you gotta, it's definitely worth it.
The only thing I wish they could have done in that game was get licensed cars.
It's like the cars are exactly like realistic.
Yeah, I know, I'm driving a Honda Civic hatchback.
Yeah, and it's called like a crapper rapper.
Yeah, like a monstro.
Yeah, you start off with an S-Corp.
Yeah, an S-Corp, what did they call that?
Something SI is what they called that.
Yeah, but it was pretty, the game is good, the graphics are fluid, the music is actually really decent.
It has some pretty good tracks running through the background.
I'm not familiar with artists, but you probably know more than I do.
There's no one in particular that we really know.
It looks like a lot of their own in-house people.
One good thing about this game also is that, which is something they should have done with the first one, is there's a lot of shortcuts you can take to win races faster or hit checkpoints in different orders and stuff like that.
and the game is fucking hard.
You win the first couple races pretty easy and then all of a sudden it jumps up and you have to really race them perfectly.
You want to talk about a hard race, just drive the motorcycle.
Oh shit, drive the motorcycle anywhere.
Motorcycle, I thought it was cool because you actually had to lean, shift your weight in order to turn a motorcycle.
So definitely this is a game to buy or rent depending on how big of a racing fan you are.
If you're kind of racy, just thinking about it, rent it.
And if you don't have a PS2 and you have an Xbox, which I don't know why the fuck you'd have an Xbox, maybe just throw it kids or something.
Fucking, hey, fuck Halo.
Yeah, I'm gonna go hit everybody on what goddamn game.
Halo sucks ass.
Oh, Steel Battalion.
Steel Battalion, yeah.
Okay, if you're buying Xbox just for Steel Battalion, that's $500 down the shitter, alright?
I'll tell you what, though, that Steel Battalion controller makes your dick feel twice as big.
Especially when it's sitting right on top of it.
Twice as big?
Anyways, um, but yeah, if you have an Xbox, you can wait.
I believe it's till...
Oh my god, that was wrong.
But anyways... Is that a challenge, Rob?
But anyways... There's no dick-measuring challenges here!
Anyways!
Like I'm trying to say for like the last three minutes, if you have an Xbox for god knows what reason... Shoot yourself?
It's gonna be out, I believe, next month for the Xbox with improved graphics and blah blah blah, and wait...
Of course you'd need an Xbox, you wanna play DDR Xbox?
No.
Okay, another one that I actually just, I got to play for a short period of time, which is actually really fun, it's at my house, I gotta start playing it more, is Panzer Dragoon Orde for the Xbox.
That game owns me, and that is sad because I fucking hate the Xbox.
But I have to speak unbiased, and that sucks ass.
First of all, it's Panda Dragoon Order, it's SEGA.
Microsoft has not tainted this game except to host the game.
It is SEGA.
They put their Xbox logo all over the fucking place.
But besides that, it's SEGA.
SEGA is now the whore of Xbox.
You know, there's actual talks of SEGA merging with Namco.
Yeah, but Xbox is also talking about buying out SEGA.
Originally, wasn't it supposed to be EA or Namco, and then Namco decided to put up more money...
Yeah, it's definitely a good game, nice and smooth, and it's pretty much everything you remember from before.
Just visually, like, amazing.
Visually enhanced.
You're still doing pretty much the same thing that you did in the very first Panzer Dragoon.
It's a shooter.
Yeah, but it's very fun.
It's something that you will never get tired of.
And there's so much stuff to unlock.
You can unlock the original Panzer Dragoon.
Dreamcast, you can unlock that.
There's a whole bunch of different dragons you can unlock for you to change to.
Don't you mean, why do you mean Dreamcast?
Don't you mean Saturn?
Sorry, Saturn.
Oh my god.
But, um, yeah, definitely.
She keeps showing me this fucking book and it's like, yeah.
Anyways.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, that was good.
Let's take a trip back to TimeSplitters 2.
This is the funniest game.
We're not traveling back hella far, but we're going back a little while.
This game is hilarious.
Except for the fact that you'll probably never ever unlock absolutely everything in this game.
I've been playing it since it came out, and I still don't even have half the characters unlocked.
The cool thing about this game is that, well, the thing that Jim and I were playing last night, is you can have a fire extinguisher and brick fight.
You sit there and throw bricks at each other.
And the coolest thing was, I was a monkey, and Jim was one of the sergeant guys.
The monkey is a foot and a half tall.
And then you got the sergeant guy who's like 6'6".
So this guy's punching over your head and I'm just walking up sucker punching him.
And the monkey has hella power but no stamina.
Yeah, I'm having to look down all the time just to hit him, but for some reason he's just so goddamn quick.
All my shots just constantly keep missing and he's constantly getting a good few sucker punches on me.
and he kicked my he kicked the crap out of me and he's a freaking monkey so because I was a monkey the monkey it's all about monkey power anyways goddamn monkey
Yeah, basically, the game, the graphics are really good.
You gotta love the facial expressions.
You can actually see facial expressions.
The voice acting is probably one of the best that I've seen in a game in a long time.
And I like the fact that the facial expressions and everything was very cartoony like it should be.
They weren't trying to be realistic.
We're not trying to go fucking Half-Life or Counter-Strike, which is fun to play.
And they had the big breasted chicks just like the first one.
Dude, the Jungle Queen.
Jungle Queen.
Dude, okay.
She has shit cover in the front, but her ass is totally exposed.
Yeah, it's a cheetah thong that doesn't really have a back strap.
Yeah, it's like Velcro to her skin or something.
Paint.
It's paint or something.
Maybe it's all natural, who knows.
Basically, if you want a game to eat up time, do TimeSplitters.
You'll...
It's fun.
And there's so much shit to unlock.
And it has a level editor, which is the greatest thing in the world.
If you want to fuck around with your friends, make an insane level.
Also, like I said before, you'll probably never unlock everything.
And also you can unlock minigames, like Snake.
It's called Anaconda, though, and it's actually a lot better.
Johnny just brought up something I should maybe bring up since it's video games.
What?
It's not out yet, but Far Cry.
A demo I recommend everyone watch to see what this game's gonna look like.
And it's on PC, it's not a console game.
Yeah, that just sucks.
But once it comes out, though, I'll make sure I have a review for you guys.
Right now there's not a whole lot going on the PC front that's worth talking about, game-wise.
Vice City's coming out, that's about it.
Who the hell cares?
I mean, seriously, if you haven't fucking played Vice City by now...
What the hell are you even doing on the face of the earth?
I just showed up.
Say hello to Brad.
I just showed up, and the reason why you wouldn't play Vice City on PS2 and you want to play on PC is because it looks like shit on PS2, and it's going to look really good on PC.
There you go.
And you're on MP3s, too.
There you go.
Okay, well, yeah, basically... And your own cars.
I don't know, unless you can think of... Dude, okay, hold on.
Everybody play The Getaway.
Play the fucking getaway, okay?
You will hear the word fuck in the opening scene at least 50 fucking times.
Every fucking goddamn fucking sentence.
And it's funny when you hear the random American guy in there, like, you crash his car, he goes, hey, I just painted that.
And fuck, in the middle of fucking... I want your Cheetos.
Okay, yeah.
There's, okay, I'm sitting here playing, and Kara's over at my house, and this guy says, I need to get your details!
And someone thought he said, I need my Cheetos.
Anyways, unless you can think of anything else, that's pretty much the end of it for this week.
I can't think of another fucking bloody fucking thing.
Play Counter-Strike Online, um, kill Johnny.
Yes.
Because he's really good at that.
Kill anyone that says 9, the number 9, 1, and then the number 6 in their name because they suck and they all die.
Hey, my first day playing, I was killing people.
And his name's Unstoppable.
If you find 916, Unstoppable.
And now I have my retro review.
If you go after any team 916, you will die.
Trust me.
You after 916, you will die.
That's the end of the game segment, in case Loki wants to say something.
Yes, Loki.
Also being released, they mentioned this weeks, weeks, months ago, is going to be One Must Fall Battlegrounds, the 3D fighter.
Ooh, did that come out?
Well, anyways, I couldn't beta test it because the fucking thing wouldn't work on dial-up, yet they just gave it to me anyways.
I have a demo, a really early demo, and I'm not beta testing it anymore, unfortunately.
But it's coming out, so look for it.
Looks really sweet.
They've got really kick-ass arenas.
They reproduce all the robots, like, perfectly and added more, and it's really fun.
They've got, like...
A bunch of different modes you can play.
They have a sports type thing where it's some sort of soccer type thing and then just death matches and crazy shit like that.
The Scatman needs to be the theme for this.
No, it's listless now.
Jamie has something retro to bring to the table.
Retro review.
Retro review.
Space Harrier on the 32X.
It's the arcade version.
End of story.
Beautiful.
Welcome to the Fantasy Zone.
Get ready.
If you guys actually want us to review new games, be sure to tell me so that I can actually get out there and test them.
Because seriously, I have no idea what you guys want to know about.
So drop me a line either in the chat room or email me or something.
Most people have my information.
That's it.
Alright Hopefully, I don't know when they're shipping out the ship for DDR Max 2
Maybe not next week, but hopefully the week after we'll have a review on DDR Max 2.
Yes, because it's coming out this week, right?
Yeah, I've got mine already pre-ordered and everything, but I don't know if they ship them to arrive at your house today.
I think they ship it on that date, so in which case I'll get it the week after.
If we're able to get our hands on it this week, look for Orange Lounge Radio to go live the night we get it.
Bring it over and we'll go live with it the night we get it and we'll play the new stuff for you right off the bat.
We'll unlock stuff on air and play them.
Yeah, I'll do the controller trick, man, and fucking unlock the whole fucking game.
Alright.
In one night.
Alright, while they drool over Battle Royale manga, we're gonna do... We've only got ten minutes left in the show, but we're gonna do a favorite segment of ours called Ask Orange Lounge.
This is where you can ask us whatever you want.
Send us questions over private message in the chat room.
However, some of your questions in the past have really sucked.
Like, will you give me money?
Will you buy me this?
Will you do this?
No.
Stupid questions are not getting asked anymore on the show.
So please send us something that's worth answering.
Thank you.
If you ask a stupid question, you'll be kicked.
Yeah.
All right.
I mean, we welcome your questions.
And, you know, we do like to say that there's no such question as a stupid question.
But, like, are you going to buy me this as a stupid question?
I'm sorry.
On this show, it is.
If you ask the question, am I stupid, we're all going to have a nice big yes for you.
All right.
Have a nice day.
That's from me.
Here we go.
Hmm.
All right.
23rd Magus.
He did.
I have a return question.
Why are you even asking us?
Yeah, you know who gave you the balls.
I mean, I would say when you're up on the altar, that's going to take like 50 times the balls.
Because Loki gave him the ball.
Not to jump to conclusions here, because these are long ways off in the future.
I have a great idea for a mat that had different conclusions on it, and you would jump to them.
Yeah, I'm kind of jumping to conclusions here.
But the ring, it's just one small step.
I don't think there's, it's just, it's more of a case of money than balls.
I mean, there's not really balls involved.
You like a girl, you buy her something.
There's really no balls involved in that.
That's just money.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
When we get into the more, the longer term commitment stuff, that's going to be the balls, really ballsy stuff.
That's what I'm trying to say.
Stop patting your ego.
Stop patting your ego.
Stop.
Right now.
Dark Child has something to add?
Someone wanted to get balls from someone and I wasn't asked to donate?
Alright.
I have a question, why don't we have a panda mic?
Jonas, if you're listening, I gave you $2 a long time ago at the tournament to get me a ball and you never got it for me.
Okay, fine then, since he brought up someone owing him money.
RoboZ, if you're fucking listening, you still owe me $3 for fucking MGL2.
My money, I want a ball, dammit.
Alright, more questions, here we go.
DDR Angel wants to know, Loki!
Which song do you plan on doing a remix to next?
I don't know.
Uh, I was looking at a bunch of different things.
I thought of one the other day, but I'm, like, drawing a blank right now.
I... Well, I'm gonna do, um... I don't know, I was looking at ghosts and stuff right now, but I don't know, I've...
I have to look at it.
It's pretty much whatever works with what I'm... If I find an MP3 that sounds good that would work with something else, then that's what I normally do.
And I don't really think of it beforehand.
So nothing yet except maybe Ghosts.
Maybe.
Maybe Ghosts.
I tried it.
It was alright.
There was another one I heard that I thought I could mix with Insertion, but I don't know.
I might... Yeah, we'll see.
I have to wait until I get my vinyl, because my vinyl's coming, and then, yeah, there's going to be, you know, obviously the show's going to be getting a new Thursday night event, well, at some point in Season 3, or it's going to be the live mix show, and the mixed vinyl on air.
That's going to be pretty awesome.
That'll be one to listen for.
Okay, we're moving right along.
I've got a lot of questions to get through in only a few more minutes.
Okay, here we go.
Zero.
Question for Zero from 23rd Magus.
I'm scared.
Zero, what would you do with two quiet Jap girls, a bucket of Choco Ready Whip, and cake pie?
Yeah, what wouldn't I do?
Oh, fuck you, pal.
No, first of all, they have to be of age.
Thank you.
He may say of age, but, you know, I will travel to the state where it is legal.
La, la, la, la, la.
Well, actually, unless it was the UK, because 16 is, you know, they're... Hawaii, 14.
Hawaii, 5-0.
Oh, my Lord.
Is that your answer?
What wouldn't you do?
Or do you have a better answer?
Okay, I would do pretty much everything within reason.
I wouldn't go, like... Within reason?
Pour them out to edibles or something.
And what about cake pie?
You wouldn't make them eat the cake pie?
Hey Loki, about your Hawaii comic, they gotta have grass on the field before you can play ball.
Just because the grass grows doesn't mean it needs to be there.
Oh my fucking god.
Moving right along...
Akuma GM has a good question.
Does Beatmania 2DX have a chance in the US?
Why?
Why no, Zero?
Why no?
Do we really want to let them ruin another good game?
If a goat can sing in American Idol, anything's possible.
Let them move!
Let them move!
If DDR-US mix was allowed, anything could happen.
I second that notion.
If DDR-US mix was allowed, 2DX-US mix can't be far behind.
DDR-USA did not happen.
Alright.
I'm cutting off questions now.
These last five questions I have are it.
Okay.
VidPala, why does cereal cost so much, and what is your favorite cereal?
I like Frosted Mini Wheats.
I want to answer your other question.
If you go to like Bel Air or Safeway, they have like two boxes of cereal for $4.
All the Kellogg's brands.
And besides, I like Apple Jacks.
Just because I just do.
They don't taste like apples!
They don't taste like apples, you stupid!
What's wrong with you?
That's not an answer!
They didn't really have an answer.
I have another favorite.
Crackle Jacks.
I like Cracklin' Oat Bran.
Cracklin' Goat Brain.
It doesn't crackle like Snap Crackle Pop.
All right, let's move on, because we've got a bunch of questions to get through.
All right.
I like Special K and Fruity Pebbles in Captain Crunch.
It depends what kind of mood I'm in.
Healthy, you know, I go with the Special K. Fruity, I go with, you know, Fruity Pebbles.
And just damn, like, cavity, you know, juicy, and I go with Captain Crunch.
And why cereal is so expensive?
It's because of all the damn toys.
And it sponsors terrorism.
You know, actually, I used to name my stepbrother Special K. Okay.
Now, why it costs so much, it's because it's somehow in some form controlled by the government.
I don't know how.
I'll figure that out later.
But I like to eat what I have for breakfast this morning, but normally I'll just take any kind of cereal and just mix them all together and add sugar and a little bit of milk.
I mean, just all the cereals together.
That way you get the best of all.
You get the marshmallows, the Apple Jacks that don't taste like apples, the Kraken goat brain, and...
Darny Darko Rock, Cellar Door, Cellar Door!
What you ate for breakfast this morning?
Shut up!
I had some of these little Japanese candies that have been sitting by the computer for a couple days.
Oh yeah, okay, my favorite cereal, I don't eat a lot of cereal, but when I do eat cereal, my favorite is the Pops, Pops, Pops, Corn Pops, yeah, Corn Pops, those are jamming, okay, and the reason why cereal is so expensive is because it's owned by Disney.
I say if you think it's expensive, just go buy it at Sam's Club or Costco and buy me a big box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, please.
Thank you.
All right.
Quick questions.
Here we go.
Nostylan wants to know, when will Orange Lounge be available for DVD or CD?
Unfortunately, due to the music that we play during the show, we can't really sell it.
As far as the content's concerned...
We're still debating kind of the whole internet distribution thing, especially now that some of our episodes are, get this, a year old, getting there.
We're thinking about letting those get distributed on Loki's site later, so.
But as far as like a CD stuff, there's not really a point.
Maybe a clip CD or something, but unfortunately the quality of the show, since we, well, the problem is that we're so low because of the modem ban, the quality of the show is really low.
There wouldn't be much point to do an audio CD, it would kind of suck.
Last few questions.
RYC3, this is kind of for Zero and Darkchild, wants to know, Rice wants to know if you will do a game review on Raven Shield.
What is that on?
We covered Raven Shield a little bit, or I did, back at the tournament weekend.
We didn't have much talking about it, though.
We can check it out again.
Once they come out with a patch that allows it to be played on my computer, because it detects a bad graphics card, then we'll review it.
I just saw something.
I wonder if we can actually dual record the show.
Like record an archive file and record a high quality file.
What if I had a really good computer?
I've thought about it and there's a way to do it.
And maybe when we move.
We'll see.
I'll try to do one on Raven Shield for you.
Give me a couple weeks to find it and get it set up and I'll have it taken care of.
Okay.
I love that song since I saw Wendell freestyle it.
Um, the song itself sucks, um...
I can't think of anything violent.
It sucks smegma.
I thought it was time.
But I like all the songs that nobody likes, so there you go.
But you know, to be honest, a lot of the club mix stuff really sucks.
I mean, the original Jam Jam Reggae sucks.
Jam Jam Reggae sucks.
Emotion!
Emotion sucks ass.
Okay, Emotion sucks ass on there because it sounds like they just recorded someone doing just the key presses of it.
It didn't even record it good or anything.
And, um, also, but Be My Paradise is alright, except the steps suck ass and it's really slow.
And the new double steps that they made for it really suck, because they're just trying to throw in a bunch of 16th note running for no apparent reason.
Be My Paradise.
I like cheese.
Alright.
BMI Paradise rocked because Mr. Wendell did this badass freestyle to it.
Big guy freestyles kick ass.
My appreciation for BMI Paradise went up like tenfold when I saw Wendell humping Mel to it.
That was homoerotic wonderful.
I appreciate Wendell.
I don't appreciate the song.
We love Wendell.
We need Wendell on this show.
All right.
One more question from SnubDisanoid wants to know, Loki or anyone that makes edits in the room, I just recently made an Afranova edit, but when I put the steps in the DDR edit max, I was two measures short, too many steps.
I have some extra steps before the normal steps start, so should I just eliminate those?
No, because DDR Edit Max, a lot of the gaps that sit on there are wrong.
I'm going to fix that at some point.
Because there's a lot of steps that are out of sync, or they'll be in sync on DDR Edit Max.
Yeah, in sync.
You are loose.
Anyways, um, no, there's a lot of, um, a lot of songs where you can make the steps on there.
I think, what was it, Dynamite Rave or one of those was one of the ones that you make on DDR Edit Max and then it gets all fucked up when you play on the arcade and it's like two bars short or something like that.
Um, just what I recommend doing is if you've got something to make an Afronova edit, or even like if you have a US version that can make an Afronova edit on there, and like, you know, just figure out what the gap value is on there.
It's like one of the, uh, values on there, the MDAT or whatever.
Look for that, and then, um, just copy that.
Or, or, what you can do is go online, find an edit for an Afro-, you know, another edit for Afronova,
and just copy that from theirs and then you'll have your synced up and you can also count how many bars it starts on and just fix it that way.
That's what I did.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
I'm going to try to fix all of those so that I can be correct.
That will come later on.
It's on the bottom of my list.
Alright, that's it.
All the questions from Ask Orange Lounge have been asked.
Thank you very much for submitting your questions.
We love you.
And now it's show end time and we ask everybody for their final thoughts.
You want to go first, Jimmy, or you want to wait?
You're going to wait.
Zero.
Final thought.
Nice catch.
I fit under a desk.
Just like an intern to be fitting under a desk.
Shut up, dick.
While you're down there.
Fuck your mama.
I have dusting that needs to be done while you're down there.
On my ass.
No.
Jim, final thought.
Final thought?
Well, this is a pretty cool show for listening to it for my first time.
It kind of makes me wish I lived up here to listen to it every single week.
We roll.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Keep rocking.
Welcome to the show.
Listen to the show.
Hey, on your first show, you picked the listless thing that ended up winning, so that's not too shabby.
I don't know how I did it, because my two other picks got knocked out.
Yeah, you kind of had crappy ones out of that, but, you know, Garlic Girls was good.
It's alright.
It's alright, you're a noob.
I'm just kind of having a bad day, I can't, I'm not, what I want to think, come up with, you know, just isn't coming up.
We love noobs on Orange Lounge, noobs love us.
Alright.
Alright.
Uh, Loki?
Um, I'm starting to get a headache.
I fucking think my blood pressure's up or something.
I, like, have bad cholesterol or something like that.
I don't know what it is.
I get a headache all the time when I come over here.
I don't know why.
I don't know what it is.
I blame Rob.
Maybe you have cat dander on you from your cat, and that's why I have a mild headache.
It's probably shirming that I'm allergic to.
Okay, fuck it.
All right.
Sorry to hear that.
Anita?
Let's see.
Captain Picard is a better captain than Captain Kirk.
because he rocks.
He's smarter and he holds his age better.
Wow.
He gets it on in Nemesis and I really don't want to see that.
I did.
Dark child.
Okay, that just made me lose some interest.
Final thoughts.
I don't really have a final thought, I guess.
I'll just throw out something, for the sake of everyone still seeing.
What the hell did he just say?
Bombay, your final thought?
Uh, my final thought, I don't have one, I don't have any thoughts right now.
Alright, um, my final thought of the night- My final thought is, you voted, they voted off Legend of Trance after one week, and you fucking kept on Goddamn DuckToy.
What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with America?
Don't get me started.
My final thought would be... God bless the USA!
My final thought?
Fuck you, Squeenix.
Very well put.
And the last word of tonight goes to... You had it before, and so didn't need a...
Let's give it to... Let's give it to... Let's give it to... Dark Child, fine.
We'll give it to Dark Child.
Last word.
Excrement Cranium You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
If you'd like to leave us a comment, send us an email at
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
I will send a flood to wipe out all the bad things.
I will save two of everything, but everything else goes.
And there'll be a lot of umbrellas.
You, Noah, stop what you're doing and build me an ark.
And Noah, who is Sean Connery.
I'm working on a speedboat at the moment.
Speedboat's much faster.
I'll shoo across the water a lot faster.
There'll be great photos for the Bible.
Now, I appreciate your sense of publicity, but I want a dark with a big room for poo.
It's going to be important.
Speedboat.
Let's go for a speedboat.
We can get all the animals with long ears.
They can sit along the side.
Because I like that.
No, you build me an ark.
Put a big motor in an ark if you want compromise.
So he started to build himself an ark, started sawing up timber.
That's not actually how you start sawing, is it?
You start sawing by going... That first bit where you...
Then you're into the middle bit of... Where you feel like your dad.
When your dad used to say, I'm off out to the garage to saw a plank of wood in half.
There we go.
No reason for it.
Now, let's see if Dr. Bronowski's still on television.
The Ascent of Man.
Sundays with my dad, that was.
So, yes, um... So the middle bit of the song... And then the end goes back into... And after a while, Noah realised he was actually punching a baboon.
Get off me!
Stop petting me!
What have you got against baboons?
I'm not punching a baboon, I'm sawing wood for an arc.
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
All right, kids, we're back.
Orange Lounge Radio, the afterbirth.
Oh, Dark Child has something to say.
Yes, Dark Child.
Okay, since I wasn't here for fuck you's, I need to say this.
Alright, fuck you to like 17 and 16 year old girls that try and pimp on like me and Zero.
I mean, first of all, the freestyle is not that cool.
Especially when I'm up there doing it.
Second of all, once you find out that we're 22 and 23, that means you're underage.
We can't do nothing about that.
Then, when you call us and find out that we're both taken and have girlfriends, that doesn't mean the next morning you wake my ass up at 10 o'clock in the morning to see what we want to do.
That means we're not available.
That means back the fuck up off of us.
Get off my jock.
You know what?
At least I was smart enough to give him a wrong phone number.
What the fuck, man?
No one fucking pips on me when I'm doing shit.
What the hell is that?
Oh, I see.
I just, you know, I'm not good enough for you.
I'm not good enough for the underage preteens.
I was good enough for you when I used to work pizza and give you a free... You want her number?
No, I'm just saying.
It's the whole ego building thing, you know?
Hey, yeah, she hit on me, yeah.
She's underage, but...
You know, man, if I was a little bit younger.
But, no, it's, what the fuck?
That sucks.
Instead I get all swayed and they're like, eh, whatever.
Whatever.
Uh, anybody else have something they want to say for afterbirth?
We're talking cosplay, go away.
I need to start hanging out with you guys, man, because you get hit on by, like, the chicks and stuff.
Why are you looking at Jamie?
I got hit on by girls when I was playing Angel Sanctuary.
Sweet.
I had fan girls and fan boys because I wasn't it.
I'm going to try and embarrass Rob.
Another thought in the afterbirth, Rob looks hot with a collar on.
I mean, if I was gay or even bi, I'd do him if he had that collar on.
Oh, the one picture.
Eh, we'll see.
Maybe if I was going out to the Rage tonight, I could get all gothy.
But I'm not, because I'm a dork.
No.
That's it, you guys.
Thank you very much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio and the Afterbirth and the whole nine yards.
And after the show tonight is a whole lot of old music, Bomani music.
There's lots of, like, five key stuff in here and, like, really old stuff.
So you guys want to stay tuned.
Tons of stuff you're not hearing right now currently in Bomani music and more.
But we do encourage you to listen to the Bobani Music Amore program, which runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station when we're not here, with all your favorite DDR, 2DX, and Dance Mania favorites.
And when you whore up our ratings, we love you.
Have you ever noticed every week you try to say that faster and faster?
Yeah, because I want to go get Boba.
But even though I'm saying it fast, I have to express my love for everybody.
I just want to collectively go down on all of you.
Wow, I'm leaving.
Goodbye.
Not you.
Thank God.
Before we get to the classic Bomani stuff, I had a quick request I am granting.
The cheat is not dead.
Yeah, the cheat is not dead.
I don't have Fogota guys on me.
But the system is down.
We're going to get Boba anyway, so bye.
My story's ending, like a fairy tale, my life Changing forever, I'm fighting in my mind I'm missing love, believe me I'll be someone Wish you'd love me, oh pretty girl You asked me to fall in love with you, take me to my soul
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
I feel my life
