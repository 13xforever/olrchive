1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
message for you sir attention! do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex. In this episode...

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hey, are there any balls down there?

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's the biggest bear you've ever seen, Dingleberry.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What's your favorite scary movie?

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Showgirls. Absolute frightful. What's yours?

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Now's the time our sprockets pay me dogs!

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'll get you, my pretty!

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,500
And your little dog, too!

13
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,000
I know kung fu.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,500
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

15
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,000
Why did they have to take the word gay?

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
No! What I expect for Spanish acquisition is gentle.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Hey!

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Dark Sakura.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Shut up! Where's my gun? This is my boomstick!

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Sky.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Come on, girls, it's time to drop the bomb!

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex with me.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What kind of warped human being would find that funny?

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Me!

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We are live, and this is episode number 39 for April the 6th of 2003.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You're tuned in to the Bomani Scene's most corrupted radio station of all things...

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Beeeeeeeemani!

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
My name is Rob Roberts, if you might know me as Sky.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,080
As always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest buddy on the farm, Miss

30
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,080
Jamie Summers.

31
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,000
You know her better as Dark Sakura.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,360
I hate the buzz, you guys, I really hate it.

33
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,080
There's nothing we can do right now, sorry.

34
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,600
In this corner, say hello to our Tech Masa Logie.

35
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,440
I'm against the wall, so technically it's not the corner.

36
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,960
I'm in mid-wall, exactly in the center.

37
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,280
Also with us tonight, we have a lot of fucking people in the house.

38
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:34,640
Say hello to 23rd Megas, say hello to DDR Angel, say hello to Blackwab, say hello to

39
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:49,800
Dave, say hello to Intern Zero, and say hello to Dark Tetsuya, oh I like Marin's answer

40
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:58,120
are here. We're outside. So just imagine that buzzing you here is the wind. Ow, I hurt.

41
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:04,440
No more battle royale in my living room. Yeah, so we have a lot of people here tonight, and

42
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:16,960
so we have a lot to talk about. Fear the paper plates! Dear good lord. We'll be talking to

43
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,640
a bit later but first we're gonna take a quick break featuring songs everybody

44
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:29,720
hates yay we're gonna start it off with an old classic Garden of Love rock we'll

45
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:35,320
be right back in a little bit to have a big clusterfuck enjoy

46
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:54,960
We can be anything that we wanna be It's not so hard like 1, 2, 3, deep in the

47
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,960
groove A fantastic world full of mystery

48
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,960
The vision so deep that the eye can't see If you don't know now, then let it be

49
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,960
We're in the groove

50
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,960
We can go

Yeah, we flow with me

54
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,960
In the garden of love

55
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,960
Go with me

56
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,960
Go with me

Wait for us

61
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,960
We gotta be there

62
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,960
Gotta be there

63
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,960
Can't let nobody hold us back when we deep in the fang

64
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,960
I wanna open up my heart, keep lovin' you

65
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,960
Get to you for lovin' me

66
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,960
The only real thing that speaks so true is deep in the grill

67
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,960
Gonna go with me

68
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,960

Deep low in you

71
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,960
In the garden of love

72
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,960
Don't go with me, just go with me

73
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,960
It's been known to me

74
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,960
In the time of love

75
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,960
oh

76
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,960
so

77
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,960
oh

78
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,960
oh

79
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,960
oh

80
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,960
oh

81
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,960
oh

82
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:29,660
Sweatin' Hubs, just waitin' out to sweat

83
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,660
Sweating, huh? Just break it out. Sweat!

84
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:40,440
Okay, challenging move!

85
00:06:40,440 --> 00:07:01,240
okay challenging move

86
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:10,240
Baby don't you cry, I don't care if you're right or wrong

87
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:17,240
The days we spent together, well it was not a waste of time

88
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:24,240
Let me settle my mind through, so you're walking away from me

89
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,240
I'll just close my eyes and, it's a pain that I get inside

90
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:37,240
What is this fate? What is this fate? What is this fate in time?

91
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:44,240
What is this fate? What is this fate? I thought that you were mine

92
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:51,240
Well, it's time to say goodbye

93
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,240
I can't even realize

94
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:04,240
And I know you'll be the one in my whole life

95
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,240
I'll never forget the way that you kiss

96
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:15,240
The way that you smile forever

97
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,240
Where did it come from?

98
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:29,000
Oh, what is this space? What is this space? What is this space? What is this space?

99
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,460
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

100
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,120
Because Bongo demands it.

101
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:50,400
Howdy ho everybody, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 39, featuring

102
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,380
The Buzz, and we apologize about that.

103
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,060
I don't know what the hell we can do about it.

104
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,520
We've moved the computers, moved the subwoofers, tried to get everything magnetic away and

105
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,520
it's not helping.

106
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,520
Everyone die!

107
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:09,040
Yeah, the sound card sucks, so you'll just have to deal with it until we move into the

108
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,880
new studio for season number 3 and then we won't have The Buzz anymore, or we'll just

109
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:21,840
have to do every show from Jamie's from now on. Buy me a new sound card. So, wow, what

110
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:27,000
a week, huh? Yeah, it's been a while since we've been on the air. Well, not really, because

111
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,880
if you guys were listening last week, you heard us live at Shaft. About this time was

112
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,640
March Magic. Two years ago, you would have heard us live at Shaft. Oh, shit. With the

113
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:43,840
entire audience in here, who's actually listening to this outside? That is an excellent question.

114
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,680
the numbers in the studio are all-time high the numbers on the web all-time low

115
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,040
no hello to all of you listening we appreciate it

116
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,120
um...

117
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,240
yeah live from Shaft, my bad

118
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:02,080
I know I know, live from March Madness last week if you were

119
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,880
listening

120
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,720
about this time was when

121
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,020
DDR

122
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,600
the buzz went away for like half a second, it was amazing

123
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,800
This is about the time that DDR Idol was finishing up.

124
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,080
This is probably about the time that, oh, I don't know, maybe 23rd Magus was taking

125
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,320
the stage right after Dr. Dick finished his routine.

126
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,160
What are you shaking the microphones for?

127
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,160
They saw him rock up all the time.

128
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,600
Okay, well first off, you have two more mics, so why don't you try swapping one?

129
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
It won't help.

130
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Trust me.

131
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,240
Trust me, I've done everything to do this buzz.

132
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,360
It's the noise of the hard drive.

133
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,600
The power of Christ compels you!

134
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
The power of Christ compels you!

135
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,200
You just made it worse. It's the noise of the hard drive in there. Or something. It's

136
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:55,080
fucked up. Anyway, so yeah, tournament. What'd you guys think? How did, uh, what'd you guys

137
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,840
think of those of you that went to March Madness? How was it?

138
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,840
A V.

139
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,840
Nice toss, Rob.

140
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,840
Um, B-

141
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,840
Uh, B in My Paradise sucks. I hate it.

142
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,840
Especially-

143
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,840
But it's Mr. Wendell. He makes everything good.

144
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,840
Yeah, but not for PA.

145
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,840
Yeah, not for PA.

146
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
Aw, you got owned.

147
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,840
Shut up. I've never played this-

148
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
You got owned.

149
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,840
I've never played it before.

150
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,840
But you got owned.

151
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,840
Ode. Shut the fuck up, man!

152
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,840
Ode.

153
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,840
Please say something.

154
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,840
Jeez, okay.

155
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,840
Young London Cobble Doubles sucked.

156
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,840
Okay, and...

157
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,840
Xenon also sucked.

158
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,840
Because it does, and it's really hard to PA.

159
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,840
Fuck that.

160
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,840
As for me, I came, I saw, I twitched.

161
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,840
The left arrow in Sakura sucks.

162
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,840
What the fuck is that, Celium and Mike?

163
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,840
It's in my hand, you're just like, wank!

164
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,840
What the fuck is that?

165
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,840
You can't let me get a comment in before you have to say some shit?

166
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:07,840
I didn't see shit. I didn't do shit but sit in that back room for both days while people flaked out on me.

167
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,840
Now you know how it feels.

168
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,840
Sorry.

169
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,840
Jamie was well done by the time that was over. She was cooking in that room there.

170
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,840
I hated people.

171
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,840
But we love Jamie.

172
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,680
We love Jamie for helping out, making everything run.

173
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,680
I mean, you got visited by lots of people, and you got to eat bubbles with me.

174
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,680
I didn't eat bubbles, I blew them.

175
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,680
Haha, she said blue.

176
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,680
Rob?

177
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,680
Yes.

178
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,680
Ow!

179
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,680
Rob died again.

180
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,960
You know, someone had to do the organizational stuff, and we're all grateful that Jamie did

181
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,560
bother to sit back there.

182
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,980
I would have done it myself but I was locked up in that goddamn glass box and trust me

183
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,700
it sucks hard being able to see the tournament and not hear a damn thing, especially on DDR.

184
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,860
I heard everything and didn't see a damn thing.

185
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:08,020
By the way, by the way, hold out your arm, you're dead too.

186
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,380
Jamie hit me with the tail of a furry thing.

187
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,880
You know I would have loved to have helped Jamie out in the back room but I was too busy

188
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,740
smoking and drinking behind everyone's backs.

189
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,740
You'll have to forgive Jamie, she's been on a battle royale kick lately.

190
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,740
We all have.

191
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,740
And we played mocap golf.

192
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,740
Only because it freaking rode over for like three holes and then you happened to get lucky and win one.

193
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,740
Otherwise it would have kicked your ass.

194
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,740
Oh shut up.

195
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,740
Yeah, who won the long drive?

196
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,740
Yeah that's right, I think I won the long drive.

197
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,740
So watch this, shut the hell up.

198
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,740
Drive for show, putt for dough, bitch.

199
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,740
Whatever.

200
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,740
Dude, I hit a 50-foot chip to make an eagle.

201
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,740
So?

202
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,740
Ooh, wow.

203
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,740
It was cool.

204
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,740
I've made chips for eagles and burritos before. It's easy.

205
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,740
Yeah. Well, you know what? That was my first one, so you can shut your mouth.

206
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,740
Hey, have you actually ever gotten par on that one that goes uphill?

207
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,740
The one that goes, like, really, really steep uphill.

208
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,740
Yes, I have gotten par on that twice.

209
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,140
God damn, I got like a quadruple bogey on that shit.

210
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,740
I have Propel!

211
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,740
This is the reason why golf is on TV and no one watches it.

212
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,740
Okay, welcome to Orange Lounge, mocap golf radio.

213
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,740
Someone must watch it, they have the golf channel.

214
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,740
I want mocap battle royale.

215
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,740
I want mocap battle royale.

216
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,740
Mocap napping.

217
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:40,740
I want somebody, anyone who has programming skill, get like, you know, Quake or one of those things, what was it you were saying, Counter Strike?

218
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,240
and make the battle royale counter strike

219
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,480
oh wait let me just say that real quick some guy hit a 357 yard drive and got

220
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,000
like a 63 to win some championship or something course record

221
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,720
good but god still hates it 357 yards in one hole

222
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,560
yeah in real life god hates golfers

223
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,520
hey what does Dave look like he's obi-wan over here golf is paid for by

224
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,000
morons who buy ugly pants use the force

225
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,080
but anyways no that's why Plaid will never go out of fashion because of golfers

226
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:21,080
I know you said that Counter Strike sucks for doing it, but for Battle Royale, Counter Strike is like the best thing to edit.

227
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,080
I hit a vital organ.

228
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,080
That's the easiest thing to do.

229
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:34,080
And by the way, yes, why, thank you for asking. Yes, I did compete last week in freestyle, and I got all fails.

230
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,080
How did that go, your very first freestyle?

231
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:48,080
I had a nervous breakdown about five minutes before it was my turn because like I fell playing a challenge in front of everybody and then I like freaked out and then I got up and finally played.

232
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:54,080
And I think I did alright for my first but it's old school and no one likes old school anymore. So fuck them.

233
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:59,080
Don't start that again.

234
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:06,080
Yes and for those of you in the chat room and listening who got to hear my lovely little rant remember it because you'll never hear it again.

235
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:14,080
I want to know who those chicks were that were massaging my hair. I have no idea who those people were, and they're just coming up against me for DVDs.

236
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:23,080
Okay, hold on, I've realized something. Don't steal a girl's glasses, because then she follows you around and annoys all your friends.

237
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:29,080
She just had these cool glasses and I stole them, and then she decided that she would try to fuck everybody or something. I don't know what it was, she was doing it.

238
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,580
So that's what I was doing wrong when I was singles.

239
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,580
I didn't steal glasses.

240
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,580
Mental notes!

241
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,580
I didn't steal glasses.

242
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,580
Yeah, you gotta steal the nerd glasses.

243
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,580
So that's how I get the preteen booty.

244
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,580
They were hoes anyway, you could tell.

245
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,580
Yeah, yeah.

246
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,580
Uh oh, looks like you hit a nerve.

247
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:57,580
Like I was telling two friends after the first day of the tourney,

248
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,580
What walks on two legs and spells slut?

249
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,580
What?

250
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,580
I'm not saying it on the air.

251
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,580
This is quiet, so...

252
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:13,580
Oh, what I need is a good defense.

253
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,580
So anyways, yeah, it was Let the Beat Hit Em that I freestyled to.

254
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:24,580
Watch the video. It's another white guy freestyling, or some white guy doing Let the Beat Hit Em. That's what the title is.

255
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,580
Yeah, that's what you got titled as, some white guy.

256
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:30,580
Some white guy. I am some white guy. That's great.

257
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,580
Xerox.

258
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,580
Well, he didn't even get my song.

259
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,580
Okay, fuck that shit, alright?

260
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,580
It's fucking clearly Zero Space X.

261
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,580
I don't know where the fuck somebody gets Xerox.

262
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,580
Okay, it doesn't even start with an X.

263
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,580
I mean, fucking go to school.

264
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,580
Fucking goat bite. Fucking morons.

265
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,580
At least you got your name.

266
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,080
You have to realize that when everybody sees that, and everybody says...

267
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,580
Blah, blah, blah, fuck you!

268
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,080
When everybody is saying...

269
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,080
Does it matter?

270
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,080
Zero X.

271
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
Hooked on phonics works for me!

272
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,080
Not for them!

273
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,580
I've got yellow fever!

274
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,080
There's a snake in my boot!

275
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,080
You know what? They were reading it as one word because they thought it was Asian typing.

276
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,580
Do me, do me, do me.

277
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:24,580
Well hey, my first tournament at March Madness last year, I was elect-toddled or something.

278
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:31,580
I looked at that paper, and it was clearly written 0x.

279
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,580
I mean, if you were that big of a moron, I'm sorry.

280
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,580
Well you just thought you were lead to Xerox with a Z.

281
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:43,580
You know what, I don't give a fuck. You could go to school. Go buy a Xerox machine!

282
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,580
I'm still ski.

283
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,580
Okay, I guess that makes it a little better, but I'm still not fucking Xeroxed.

284
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,580
At least you're not some white guy doing some song.

285
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:59,580
I am some white guy, and I swear to God if another face goes in my hand, another hand goes in my face, I'm gonna punch somebody.

286
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,580
I'm blind!

287
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,580
What up, mah honkies?

288
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,580
I am some white guy.

289
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,580
You are some white guy, but I am the other white guy.

290
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,580
Okay, Freestyler.

291
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,580
Whatever, Intern.

292
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,900
Ooh, intern, that's a thing.

293
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,260
Well, at least he's part of staff.

294
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,780
I die.

295
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,620
I'm still curious to see who's actually here.

296
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,500
Oh, with the P.

297
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,780
Moving right along.

298
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:32,740
Let's talk about why everyone's here right now.

299
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,660
They're all here to see me.

300
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,540
I think actually the celebrity of the weekend

301
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,580
would be DDR Angel, who's back.

302
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,420
OK, and then Jamie.

303
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:44,420
So, Angel, you've been where for the past five weeks?

304
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:49,420
I went to Japan for five weeks, and I missed all of you guys for five weeks, but that's okay.

305
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,420
What part of Japan did you go to?

306
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:59,420
I went to Kyushu Island, which is basically the southernmost, almost the southernmost part of Japan.

307
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,420
Kyushu Island, Kagoshima City.

308
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,420
So what kind of stuff did you get to see while you were there?

309
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,420
You want to hear a story?

310
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,420
Yeah, let's hear a story.

311
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,420
A funny story?

312
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,420
Yay!

313
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,420
Well, I thought it was funny, but okay.

314
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,420
This is the worst time. The buzz stops.

315
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,420
I know. Just ignore the buzz.

316
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,420
Shut up!

317
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,420
Alright. Alright, so...

318
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,420
I went shopping one day with my relatives and my mother and whatever.

319
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,420
Okay, so I walk into the store.

320
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,420
What do I hear right outside the door?

321
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,420
DDR music.

322
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:32,420
I run through the store frantically looking for a DDR machine going,

323
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,420
I gotta play. I gotta play. I gotta play.

324
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,420
I mean, I sounded like Loki, okay?

325
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,420
Where's the machine? Where's the machine? Where's the machine?

326
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:46,920
Did I find it? Did I find it? No, no, no, I didn't find it.

327
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,920
I ended up noticing that it was coming from the freaking loudspeaker!

328
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:59,920
So, I woke up to this lady that was working there, and I kindly asked her,

329
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:04,920
Was it her CD? Just, you know, by the off chance that it might have been.

330
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,920
And she said no, that it was the stores.

331
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,920
So...

332
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,920
No, no, no.

333
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,920
See, cause then I said, can I buy it?

334
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,920
And then she looked at me like a weird look, or with a weird look.

335
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,920
And then she was probably saying in her head,

336
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,920
she was stupid American.

337
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,920
So, did you get to go to any arcades while you were down there?

338
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,920
Yeah, I got to go to one.

339
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,920
Is DDR dead?

340
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:39,920
I got to play some Japanese people, and they thought I was cool, and they thought I was really good.

341
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,920
And I kicked his ass.

342
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,920
That's awesome. Did you actually play DDR?

343
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,920
Yes I did.

344
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,920
And there were actually other people playing DDR?

345
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Yes.

346
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,920
I knew it was rumors.

347
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,920
Yes, I played Popin' Music 9.

348
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,920
How was Popin' Music?

349
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:57,920
Popin' Music was okay, but unfortunately, sorry Joe, but can I do that?

350
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,920
Sure, man.

351
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,920
Dude.

352
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,920
Anyways.

353
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:12,920
We were playing Poppin' Music here last night because our new Bimani friend Garrett brought it over, and it has Boa Boa Lady Another on it. That, in itself, made my day.

354
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:17,920
We'll get to, we'll get to, we're still going on the Japan trip, we'll catch up to present.

355
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,920
Where was I?

356
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,920
Poppin' Music 9.

357
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:25,920
That's right, Poppin' Music 9. Now what was the rumor that was going around for Poppin' Music 9?

358
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
Absolut.

359
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:33,920
Yes, absolute. I played absolute. And what did I do? What did I do? I passed it!

360
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,920
Yay!

361
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,920
There is proof! Rob has proof!

362
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,920
Tron was in it. Tron was in it.

363
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,920
Well, Doctor 2 apparently thought it was a rumor, I don't know.

364
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,920
Whatever, whatever. So we know it's really there and all that jazz.

365
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:04,920
Speaking of which, I will be going to Japan in two weeks, or two weeks, so that will be cool.

366
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,920
Dave gets it! Squeak!

367
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:12,920
I'm going to Tokyo and Kyoto and Osaka, and I'm not going to Baidu Park.

368
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:21,920
But what? Why? Because my brother is there right now, and we're going to see him because over the summer he will be in Tokyo doing something for work.

369
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:27,160
for work or something like that and so he'll be doing something and so we're

370
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,560
going to see him because it'll be like last time and I'm going to be in Tokyo

371
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:35,040
for three days and then I think Osaka for like a week and Kyoto for a few days

372
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:41,160
and I will go to an arcade and I will see if I'll yeah I'll go to the really

373
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:45,320
big one in Tokyo and I'll be like wow there's no playing DVR it's in the corner

374
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:59,320
My brother went to a fairly large arcade there and they had a whole Bomani corner and he took a picture of it. It was empty. There was no one playing.

375
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:05,320
Hey Dave, do you really want to get drunk in Japan?

376
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,320
I don't know.

377
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,320
Because I know a really quick way.

378
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,320
How?

379
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:19,400
Go to a vending machine that has beer and like nobody's watching you still money in it and you can get beer and get drunk

380
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,760
Japanese beer isn't that good?

381
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,120
Yeah, but they have sake too

382
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,520
Dun dun dun. I have a question for angel. No, I have a search for Rachel

383
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,360
Did you were there any other like interesting games that you saw there?

384
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,200
Like new games that a lot of people seem to be playing like maybe outside of Omani or any other kinds of games that seem to

385
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:46,200
What kind of game was it, like a fighting game?

386
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:53,200
It seemed like it was a racing game, so maybe it's another Initial D.

387
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,200
Initial D is also ridiculously popular in the Asian sector.

388
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:05,200
There were like five Initial D machines in this arcade I saw in Singapore, and in the freaking airport in Korea they had an Initial D machine.

389
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,200
Which leads me to believe that, you know, and they had to pump it up and lose to Korea, so...

390
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,200
My uncle and my aunt and everybody was looking at me and I was like, sorry?

391
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,200
Okay, now I'm considered crazy great.

392
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,200
Did you get to eat at America Town?

393
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,200
For anybody that saw The Simpsons?

394
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,200
What in the? Alright, whatever.

395
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,200
Okay, there's an episode of The Simpsons where they go to Japan and Homer's, you know, where do they want to eat?

396
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,200
Homer wants to go eat at America Town and Marge is like, we could eat American food back home.

397
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
But he insists they go to America Town.

398
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:11,200
And then the waiter is like, hi, I am stupid American waiter. Can I take your order? Would you like meat, food?

399
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:25,200
When you go, I'll get you the address for the Taito arcade. You need to go there and take me pictures, because I want to go there to see the rose and rose upon bubble wobble machine.

400
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,200
There's so many people I know going to Japan in the next week or two. It's crazy.

401
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,640
No, seriously, my roommate's going to Japan for a year, Angel just came back to Japan,

402
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,640
Dave's now going to Japan, one of my really good friends in Seattle is going to Japan.

403
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,640
I've had so much shit coming back for me, it's not even funny.

404
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,520
You have to bring me back a magazine, Dave.

405
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,520
Dave.

406
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,520
Bring me back a magazine.

407
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,640
Dave, I have another quick request, I have another quick request.

408
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,400
If I loaned you a remote kit, would you go and do interviews with people in the arcade?

409
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,600
Would you just do random interviews?

410
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,880
Dude, Baka Gaijin on the street would be the greatest segment ever.

411
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:03,320
American in Japan. Come on, you gotta do it. Well, what would I interview them on?

412
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,000
Ramani, you gotta go to the arcade. You're gonna go to an arcade while you're there,

413
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,880
right? Yeah. Just say, hey, I'm from the American media. And say, there's this really big American

414
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,520
show and I wanna talk to you about this game that's taking over America. And they'll probably

415
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:26,720
go, huh? I just talked to random businessmen and like, Sarariman! I could try. I mean,

416
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,660
I don't know Genki da and then go orange lounge radio. Yay

417
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:39,160
Say you're from orange launch radio you you'll get laughed out of the country. Okay. All right sons bonsai. Oh

418
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,560
My god state you asked you on the show. Oh

419
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,000
Wait, wait, wait Rob

420
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,080
Another random sighting. What's that?

421
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,060
Synchronized love during a car commercial with like a bunch of horror girls and black and yeah

422
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,060
Yeah, my friend had a cow.

423
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,060
Did you happen to get to see any Para clubs?

424
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,060
Or did you get to go to any Para clubs?

425
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,060
Did you go to a store that sold big boots?

426
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,060
No.

427
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,060
Boring.

428
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,060
Yeah, but I was at this...

429
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:12,060
Remember, Para's a big thing in Tokyo and Osaka.

430
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,060
And she wasn't there, so...

431
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,060
True.

432
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,060
True enough.

433
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,060
Okay, so anything else you want to tell us about your trip?

434
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:31,060
Um, not, except, uh, you have to post that one picture of that, um, unmentionable thing, that I was talking about, that nobody knows about in America.

435
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,060
I'll have to find it.

436
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,060
I'll find it for you.

437
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,060
Okay, we'll have to find it later.

438
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,060
Neat, um...

439
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:41,060
I have an F.U. about everything later, by the way, if that's okay with you.

440
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,060
We'll do F.U.s later.

441
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,060
What?

442
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,060
Super toilet, maybe.

443
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,060
Maybe?

444
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:51,460
Okay, so, moving right along. So, Angel comes back into town, we decide to have a little

445
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:57,500
welcome home party last night, so that's why everybody was here. Almost everybody! Somebody

446
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:02,500
forgot to, I don't know, inform me that this stuff was going on! Everyone's like, everyone's

447
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,420
like, hey, you going to the party? What party? There was a frickin' huge party here last

448
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:10,500
night, there was like, literally everybody was there, and everyone's still here. It was

449
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,740
not my job to send out the invitations, I thought everybody knew through the chat room,

450
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,380
I thought Angel was harassing everybody as they came to the chat room.

451
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:25,380
I didn't even know about it until we looked in your live journal.

452
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,860
Yeah, I didn't even know about it, so fuck you.

453
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:33,300
I brought it up to her and she's like, what party?

454
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,740
It wasn't supposed to be a party, it was supposed to be friends come over and we hang out and

455
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,740
then we go to Scandia.

456
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:42,220
We're going to have a social gathering and have a good caravan that goes to Scandia.

457
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,220
Suddenly, oh my gods, there's a party going on in my house.

458
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,220
Well dude, there was popin' music.

459
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,220
I mean, it's popin'!

460
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,220
What's that stand in there?

461
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,220
I brought germania.

462
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,220
Yeah, you did, didn't you?

463
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,220
Yes, I did.

464
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,220
But there was popin'.

465
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,220
And Rob's all like,

466
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,220
Angel's coming, Angel's coming, Angel's coming!

467
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,220
Do a theater near you!

468
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,220
This summer, Angel...

469
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:15,220
Angel returns, coming to a theater near you this summer.

470
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,220
Anyway, yeah. Hi.

471
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:22,220
So, we had a party, and we watched Battle Royale, because Angel hadn't seen this movie.

472
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,220
And if you haven't seen Battle Royale yet, Jamie, break it down.

473
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:28,220
Talk about what Battle Royale's all about, for those who haven't seen.

474
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:35,220
In the future, students boycott school, so the Japanese government decides to enact the B.E.R. Act,

475
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:42,220
which means that they figure randomly selected 9th grade class, put them all on an island, and they have to kill each other until one's left.

476
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:46,220
There's a lot more symbolic meaning behind that.

477
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,220
True, but I like watching all the deaths.

478
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:52,220
But watching a whole bunch of really pretty Japanese people kill each other is a sheer joy in life.

479
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,220
Dude, it was all about Mitsuko.

480
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,220
I don't want to be a loser.

481
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,220
Jayama, my hero.

482
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:03,220
He was my hero. If he was a good guy, it would have been better.

483
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:09,220
The guy who had the radio that told me where everybody else was, I would have lived a lot longer than he did, you know?

484
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,220
Dude, he lived a long time.

485
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:16,220
That was Hiroki who had the GPS, but my favorite was Mimura, the hacker.

486
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,220
He's Mimura.

487
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:23,220
He was so awesome, and I finally caught the pun of the name of his computer, the third man.

488
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,220
Ah.

489
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,220
After his own name, Mimura.

490
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:32,220
But then of course after we watched Battle Royale, what did you think of Battle Royale, Angel? The first time seeing it?

491
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,620
It kicked much ass, and then we had much fun afterwards.

492
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:41,860
Yes, after we watched Battle Royale, a battle royale broke out in my living room with paper

493
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,300
plates and magic markers.

494
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,380
And scotch tape and red marker and...

495
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:50,100
I wrote up name tags for people who died and how they died.

496
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,580
DDR Angel choked on a pretzel.

497
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,740
And all the time I was in the other room playing pop music.

498
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,860
I got hit in the eye with a candle.

499
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,860
Choked on a pretzel?

500
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:06,740
even want to know she was hanging out with George Bush okay now I know I don't

501
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:12,380
want to know so now we're thinking gee how can we incorporate battle royale to

502
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,980
our everyday lives and one idea is maybe we could just go to Qsar and take our

503
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,820
frustrations out that way but Qsar is not messy enough so we decided maybe

504
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:23,460
paintball but then paintball paintballs hurt they really do hurt when they

505
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:27,620
shall wear loose clothes or thinking doesn't hurt you talk to my friend did

506
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,620
You're trying to get me to buy the gun as well!

507
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,620
Damn you! Damn you!

508
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,620
I know you, Andy!

509
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,620
You've gotten to them also!

510
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,620
What we need to do is we actually need to make the survival packs.

511
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,620
And pick a place, go camping.

512
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:44,620
And we need to give one person a fan.

513
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,620
Give some person a pellet gun.

514
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,620
You know?

515
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,620
Dude, seriously.

516
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,620
When Battle Royale first came out,

517
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:00,140
Tokyo Pop the magazine had this big huge feature on it and it had all the weapons of the kids

518
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:04,700
that you didn't see on TV and there were some seriously ridiculous ones like a pot lid.

519
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:10,120
Dude the pot lid was the best thing in the movie and it even proved it.

520
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,340
Battle Royale Online dot com.

521
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,340
Go there.

522
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,340
But yeah I mean seriously.

523
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:19,180
The pot lid was the best and everybody knows it because it saved his life.

524
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:22,780
Dude the psycho guy Kiriyama he got the freaking Hadasen.

525
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,220
He was my hero and he killed everybody.

526
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:29,220
And one of the girls who was up on the mountain, like one of them got the megaphone.

527
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,220
The other girl with her got a headband that said, go for it.

528
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,220
But seriously, in my opinion, the best character was our...

529
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,220
Well, I'm not going to give it away. Never mind.

530
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:43,220
My favorite guy was the other foreign exchange student.

531
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,220
Yeah.

532
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,220
Yeah, how would that give them away?

533
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,220
The one who helped them out.

534
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,220
What would that point be?

535
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,220
One more thing about Japan.

536
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:58,220
Oh man, you're in the winner's pool, how many does he need to go back and forth?

537
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,220
Yeah, go. Rough.

538
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,220
Anyways!

539
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,220
What do you need now?

540
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,220
Huh?

541
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,220
What do you need?

542
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,220
There's one thing that we roll over Japan, okay?

543
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,220
What?

544
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:15,220
I saw no, no Extreme Machines over there! None! None!

545
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,220
Really?

546
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,220
And we have them all over the place, so what happens?

547
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,220
Extreme Machines!

548
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,220
DDR is dead.

549
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,220
DDR is dead.

550
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,220
But that means I'm dead.

551
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,220
You're not dead.

552
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,220
Look at the beginning of my name.

553
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:32,540
You've got to remember that in Japan the fad, the life cycle for fads there is like ridiculously

554
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,540
fast.

555
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,380
You know what, in a year, no not even a year, in like three months you're going to change

556
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,420
your nickname to 2DX Angel.

557
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,180
Because why, what happens?

558
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:44,100
Everybody gets, everybody gets freaking burned out on DDR and then they're all of a sudden

559
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,100
they're 2DX.

560
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,900
So you'll be 2DX Angel in three months, I guarantee it.

561
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,900
Is 2DX still big there, or is it like, is all the monies dead?

562
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,900
Trust me, she hasn't been getting very good.

563
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,900
Haven't you?

564
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:58,900
Actually, I got some, like, schoolgirls to, like, take a picture, so it's cool.

565
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,900
They were playing, and they were-

566
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,900
Hey, you can pass, yeah, you can pass 5-1-1.

567
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,900
Loki!

568
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,900
Would you like to make a comment on schoolgirls?

569
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,900
Ooh, schoolgirls.

570
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:13,900
Roses are red, violets are blue.

571
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,900
This show's about panties.

572
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:22,520
the back of the colorful DVD that Loki gave us all during March Madness it's

573
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:27,660
just like what the fuck it's also got an alternate cover in the other side more

574
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:35,720
panty action you actually see butt crack in that one the one suggestion for

575
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,000
battle royale that didn't get said was that we were all gonna wear white

576
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,780
sweaters or white sweatshirts and white sweatpants and then like have magic

577
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,780
We just draw over each other.

578
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,780
No, no.

579
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,780
We're actually...

580
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,780
I think we do that.

581
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,780
We need to do like actual...

582
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,780
We need to make like fake uniforms or something.

583
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,780
Okay, we would either...

584
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,780
If we all walked around in white shirts...

585
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,780
No, because that's what stands by.

586
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:59,780
If we all walked around in white shirts and white pants, these people would either think

587
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:03,780
A, we're doing Battle Royale or B, we're the next Heaven's Gate.

588
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,780
What was that?

589
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,780
That was on Loki's old sig?

590
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,780
Drink the Kool-Aid and follow the comet?

591
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,780
Die, die, die.

592
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,780
Seriously though, we should go back to Q's art.

593
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,780
He's rapping cool.

594
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:46,220
And then we have like a, a, a Guacamole Del Taco inspired keychain.

595
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,740
He said pull down, should I be afraid yet?

596
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,060
I have Pocari Sweat.

597
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,100
Angel Rules!

598
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,100
Again.

599
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,100
Alright.

600
00:36:55,100 --> 00:37:00,180
On that note, we're gonna go to a quick break, or we're gonna come back and we're gonna do

601
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,140
the FUs of the Week.

602
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,060
Let's play more songs like that.

603
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,700
Or we can talk about news.

604
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,700
What do you wanna do?

605
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,700
Let's do news.

606
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,060
Okay, we'll do, we'll do news when we come back, not FUs just yet.

607
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:18,060
So, we're going to do songs that suck. No, don't pick them from there. Do this. If you want songs that suck, go to this directory.

608
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,060
No, I want that song, actually.

609
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:22,060
You do want that? Okay, we're not going to do songs that suck. This one? Okay.

610
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,060
Alright.

611
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,060
But not in the first place. Do them both.

612
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:30,060
Okay. We'll be back in a little bit and we're going to talk about Bamani news. Oh my god.

613
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:34,060
And we'll do the FUs of the Week, Cage Match, Match Game. It's all coming up. Thanks for listening.

614
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:34,140
And it never speaks of me

615
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:38,940
I'd never create love

616
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,880
No, no, no, no

617
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,220
I don't have enough

618
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,920
Don't have enough

619
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,620
No, no, no, no

620
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,980
I don't have enough

621
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,800
No, no, no, no

622
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,800
I'm the one who wants to feel alive

623
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,800
I'm the one who dreams of people

624
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:44,160
Sisting in the corner with a coffee cup Reading to me by night looking up

625
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:49,640
She smiles and she finds funny death Not some light shining in her hair

626
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,920
When she leaves, you want to follow me

627
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,640
When the dress is too tight

628
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,840
But you can't let her see you there

629
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,280
And she's a hot one, and a fiend

630
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,920
Tula senorita

631
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,560
You'll never get close enough

632
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,560
To nothing to be done

633
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,560
Hoorah!

634
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,560
Is that a wizard?

635
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,560
You've got to be kidding me

636
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,560
Oh yeah

637
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,560
I know she has a mind, she has an attitude

638
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,560
And she makes her be solid too

639
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,560
She'll tease you or please you

640
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,560
Feeling good over you

641
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,560
Like you knew she would

642
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,560
When she smiles it's like the

643
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,840
Like the sun shining on your face

644
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:46,920
Falling and stretching the land of the day

645
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,360
Hanging up, hot water, and the tea, ah

646
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,920
Tula tenorita

647
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,560
Ah, california

648
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,200
Tula tenorita

649
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:03,320
Tula tenorita

650
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,320
Hooray!

651
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:59,440
I feel it, I feel it, I feel it You are the only one, let me feel this way

652
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:23,440
I feel it, I feel it, I feel it You're the only one that makes me feel this way

653
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:33,440
For the Step Squad to Orange Labs, this media is stocks! Holla!

654
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,440
Stump, stump, stump, stump!

655
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:36,440
I want a slipper!

656
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,440
That's right, PS!

657
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,440
TTPO!

658
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,440
Hi. You're a little—son of a bitch.

659
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,440
Super Patapata, you're a beast!

660
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,440
I need to turn the repeat thing off. My bad.

661
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,440
You should have seen it earlier at Scandia today. I licked Meg's titties.

662
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,440
Don't do that, please.

663
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,440
Angels got the proof.

664
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,440
Yes, you have photographic proof.

665
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,440
So, um, hi, what were we going to talk about when we come back? Oh yeah, news. Loki, give us news.

666
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,440
Hold it first. Rob?

667
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,440
What?

668
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,440
Photographic proof will be up on www.ungluedbemind.tk tomorrow.

669
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,440
Hooray.

670
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:25,440
Anyway, so I'm with actual news for once, because we've been lacking for quite a while.

671
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,440
You big dirty liar!

672
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,440
Shut up!

673
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,440
Anyways, we're going to start talking about, first thing of course is going to be MaxTube.

674
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:37,440
The release is coming out in a couple of weeks actually, for the home versions, and I've

675
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,440
already got it on order, so it's cool.

676
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,440
But what's awesome is it's going to be coming with yet another v-rare, and what's cool is

677
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:50,440
I think this is going to be a hint at some of the stuff that we're going to see as hidden songs in Max 2, and also as stuff that's going to be DDR Extreme 2.

678
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,440
So, let's go down the list here, um, see...

679
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,440
This is not what I wanted.

680
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,440
Okay, hold on. Let's see, um...

681
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,440
La la la. Oops.

682
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,440
And, let's see here...

683
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,440
There we go.

684
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,440
That's the one that we were just looking at.

685
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,440
Yeah, way to go.

686
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,440
There we go. Alright.

687
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:22,440
Now, the songs that will be in there. We've got some, it looks like the Max 2 for the home version is going to be the System SF remix of the whole, you know, series.

688
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:32,440
We've got first brand new song by them, Feelings Won't Fade extended trans mix that's going to be on the V-Rare CD. Plus three songs that are going to be hidden within Max that are going to be long versions of those songs.

689
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:38,580
We've also got Kind Lady, the Future Trance mix, Midnight Blaze, the System SF mix, Glacial,

690
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:45,960
which is the brand new Ryu Kosuka song, and an I Feel New Age Hope mix, which is also

691
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,280
by System SF.

692
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,840
Because everyone got a big fat Woody over drop the bomb System SF mix, now it's like,

693
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,760
oh, let's let the dude remix everything.

694
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,220
Yeah?

695
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:57,220
Pretty much.

696
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:58,220
Pretty much, I think I summed it up.

697
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:02,240
But these songs right here, I'm predicting it here, you're going to see those all his

698
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,240
that's hidden songs in Max 2. Those are all going to be hidden songs in there.

699
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,240
And they're also going to be probably in...let's see...

700
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:14,240
They're also going to be...

701
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,240
Sorry, I flashed Jimmy. Anyways, they're also

702
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:26,240
going to be hidden songs with...or also going to be new songs for probably the US Max 2

703
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:30,240
and also going to be in

704
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:37,240
you know, obviously, DDR Extreme 2, so look for those, and we'll probably have MP3s as well as Bamaiso have MP3s.

705
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:42,240
They quote six hours after the game comes out, they will have MP3s up on their site, so look for them.

706
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,240
They should have the MP3s there.

707
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,240
Now, also, on top of that, since we're...

708
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:52,240
Actually, I'd hate to cut you off, but you know, when Max USA came out, we actually went live and played Max USA on air.

709
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,240
We'll do the same thing for Max 2.

710
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,240
Okay.

711
00:46:55,240 --> 00:47:06,240
And let's see now, we've also got, since we were talking about that, more info on Max 2. They've announced some of the playlist, or some of the song list that's going to be there.

712
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:22,240
It's going to be a lot of, pretty much everything has come back from the arcade version of Max 2, except A Minute, let me see, I believe it is A Minute, the Whistle song, ah shit, there's like four songs that they were cut.

713
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,240
Anyways, so those will not be back.

714
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,240
Um, there's rumors that they're gonna be just, you know,

715
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,240
unlocks, but I don't know.

716
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:33,240
There's another, there's another picture that they said that they saw a minute in it for the home version,

717
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,240
so it's possible it's an unlock.

718
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,240
Also on top of that, you're gonna have some of the older songs.

719
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,240
You're gonna have Kind Lady and So in Love in there,

720
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,240
plus, you know, Dynamite Rave and all the old, uh, pretty much all the third mixed stuff.

721
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,240
All the barfeed caddas.

722
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,240
Yeah, all those that were in there before.

723
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:49,240
And there's gonna be some DDR Extreme preview tracks in there.

724
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,240
Like.

725
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,240
Crash.

726
00:47:51,240 --> 00:48:10,240
But here's the thing. It's going to be basically, just like the, which I'll be covering in just a second, the Dancing Stage Megamix, which is going to have Crash, Vanity Angel, and Memories. All the Euromix 2 stuff. So that's what I predict will be in probably Max 2 there, is those three songs, maybe some more, but I'm guessing those three for sure.

727
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,240
Cool.

728
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:19,240
On top of that, there's going to be oni modes as well, and the ability to make your own custom oni modes.

729
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,240
Neat.

730
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,240
Custom onis, so that'll be kind of cool.

731
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,240
Stop it!

732
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:29,240
What the fuck are you doing with this stupid hedgehog flying over my damn head?

733
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,240
Or weasel or whatever the fuck that is.

734
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:37,240
Anyways, so that's what's coming up, we'll have that.

735
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:47,240
Now, aside from all that, I mean it. I'm going to rip that thing in half.

736
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,240
What? Am I the moki in the middle? Is my moki in the middle?

737
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,240
No, no, no. You're the loki in the middle.

738
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,240
Okay, anyways, so now let's get to some other news other than that.

739
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,240
We'll cover Dancing Stage Megamix in just a second.

740
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:03,240
Really quickly here, moving along, we've got Popping Music 9 info.

741
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,240
And this is kind of cool. They were talking about, it sounds like it's almost like Bishi Boshi here.

742
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:35,240
BoshiBoshi here. Now they have Popping Music 9 Imal, which is, I guess, it's going to be a version of Popping Music 9. It's kind of like the powered up versions of Guitar Freaks where it has, you know, the e-cards that are going to go in there, you know, the magnetic cards that store all your data, and you're going to have a lot of different modes in there. Like, for instance, you can, like, swap, I guess you can earn items in this game with the scores that you get to buy stuff and you can send it to each other. They have, well, let's see, let's get to the actual cool stuff.

743
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:42,240
They've got a minigame in it that's called Bomani that's actually like Beatmania because there's a turntable on this machine.

744
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:47,240
There's a turntable and two keys, which is kind of weird. Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.

745
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:52,240
They've got another game called Pooka Pooka, which is in...

746
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,240
Sounds dirty.

747
00:49:54,240 --> 00:50:00,240
This game, you use the buttons to avoid objects while trying to reach the good, whatever the fuck that means.

748
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,120
uh...

749
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,580
entirely practice you know something like that uh... people tennis it pretty

750
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:06,660
much it sounds like fishy-boshy you know

751
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:09,640
and they're gonna have some songs uh... new songs

752
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,900
but now

753
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:11,680
ok

754
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,720
some else

755
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:17,620
the uh... thing that you've probably been waiting for guitar freaks nine

756
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:19,820
we found out that they actually have

757
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:24,400
i don't even wanna know what's going on behind me ok honestly i see flashes of light

758
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,560
and a stupid weasel thing flying around

759
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,380
i don't wanna know

760
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,420
what you guys are taking pictures of

761
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,820
especially since it's around my ass

762
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:38,340
i'm really afraid to see what that stupid thing is doing to my ass ok

763
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:39,300
so anyways

764
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:42,140
now guitar freaks

765
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:45,900
we've got a lot of transplants songs from pop music that are going to be in it

766
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:50,500
plus some pretty cool shit we've got uh... apple and honey from pop music that's going to be in there

767
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:55,200
uh... c777 from pop music impulse of blue now that sounds like blue impulse

768
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,380
but you know it's probably a different song

769
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:59,540
uh... i'm a loser

770
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:02,700
that's going to be in their uh... we've got the extra stage as being quite a

771
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:06,740
skill by jimmy wack also might remember he is the guy that did uh... across the

772
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:07,540
nightmare

773
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:11,300
we've also got the on court stage from dance maniacs mad black by the

774
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:14,300
infection which is really awesome so

775
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:17,540
uh... that bonus tracks we're gonna have you know some longer since i think we

776
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:22,660
have a dream tonight uh... twinkle star cries in the wilderness and

777
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:27,060
uh... used to rock and roll that is in an election system the black horizon

778
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:31,260
sounds pretty sweet. And they have an encore stage of model DD4 which I believe is a sequel

779
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:36,180
to another song they did. Oh dear. Let's see, now license songs, they're really cool. They've

780
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:42,560
got Party Hard by Andrew W.K. You might remember that song. They've also got Show Business

781
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:50,180
by ACDC. Oh dear god. No! No! No! No! No! And Mr. Children, I recognize Mr. Children,

782
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:56,780
or Cross River Mr. Children I think. But there's some other J-Rock stuff in there too, I don't

783
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:06,020
no j-rock so I mean I don't know look at the list um he told me is the one who

784
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:13,760
did my sweet darlin all right and she has a song called a Dante now now that's

785
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,940
all out of the way that's all about guitar freaks night and drum meeting

786
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:22,560
eighth yes so now we're gonna have Wow I'm so moist in anticipation of guitar

787
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:27,560
That's just gross.

788
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:34,560
Okay, now, finally, with the list of the song, the game will probably never play because it's in Europe. Fucking Europeans.

789
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:40,560
They've got a brand new dancing stage megamix. It's going to be basically equivalent to R-Max 2 or whatever.

790
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:45,560
Anyways, it's going to have seven licensed songs, Stealing Beats by Kid Galahad.

791
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,560
Never heard of it.

792
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,560
Love at First Sight by Kylie Minogue.

793
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,560
I have that, we can play it.

794
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,560
Love Cats by The Cure.

795
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:56,560
That's so awesome that the Cure gets into DDR, and it's a shitty song.

796
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:06,560
When you look at me by Christina Milan, shake your body by Shai FX and T-Power featuring D.J.

797
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,560
One Step Closer by S. John G.

798
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,560
And a little less conversation Elvis vs. J. X.

799
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,560
Little less conversation. Little less conversation.

800
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:19,560
I don't know the fucking word, but I'm just going to make them up.

801
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:24,560
They're pretty much going to have the same shit we're going to have on our DDR Max 2.

802
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:31,560
It's going to be all the Konami Originals, plus the preview songs from DDR Extreme.

803
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,560
Same shit there.

804
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,560
But here's what the funny part is.

805
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:39,560
Their unlock system. Their unlock system is a joke.

806
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:44,560
Isn't it like you just play a song? You don't even have to pass it. You just play it and then...

807
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,960
Dink! You get an unlock!

808
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:21,560
3 unlocks, you get training mode, 6 points, you get edit mode, you get 10 points and pass

809
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:29,840
70 songs, you get max 300, 15 points and 100 songs, you get endless modes. Whoopity-doo.

810
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:38,560
What a shit. Alright, that's it, that's all the news I have. Yay, that was wonderful.

811
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:42,880
Oh, and if the DDR Extreme OST came out, the non-stop sucks ass. That's it. Why does the

812
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:52,420

00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,440
Oh god.

825
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,440
Hold on.

826
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,440
Anyway.

827
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,440
Jamie, come here.

828
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,440
Because you need to hear this.

829
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,440
Alright.

830
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:20,440
But before we go to the F.U.'s of the week, we want to play one quick song.

831
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,440
Loki, you want to introduce this song?

832
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,440
Yes.

833
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,440
This is the remix that I did for Jamie.

834
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,440
For her brand new F.U. music.

835
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:32,440
It's Schlegelwerk, Dark Sector, and we'll fuck you up mix.

836
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:41,440
Alright, so this is a brand new Loki remix, in honor of, thank god, because I have to piss so bad.

837
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:48,440
Okay, here we go, it's Slagwerk, the Dark Sacral Will Fuck You Up mix by Loki. Enjoy.

838
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,440
This is the end of the video.

839
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,440
Hope you enjoyed it.

842

This is FOSTA!

843
00:57:55,440 --> 00:58:21,880
What did you think of that?

844
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:22,880
You like that?

845
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:23,880
Happy.

846
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:28,280
that's a good one

847
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:31,920
that was uh... the world premiere of slag work the dark sacral fuck you up

848
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,880
mixed by low-key

849
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,840
very cool and and

850
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,440
and the best thing about it

851
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,280
uses the f word a lot

852
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,120
like that

853
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:47,560
it's the first good one dedicated to me

854
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:51,480
angel got jamie a happy bunny for her

855
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:52,780
the keychain, yeah.

856
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,080
That was very cool.

857
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:57,220
OK, kids, so is that your new FU theme then?

858
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:58,720
OK, yes, that's the new FU theme.

859
00:58:58,720 --> 00:58:59,220
Great.

860
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:00,060
That was fucked up.

861
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:04,560
So I guess now before we get to the FUs of the week,

862
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:07,360
I have to give everyone in the room a lecture.

863
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:10,800
Last week, the FUs of the week went on for like an hour.

864
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,560
So let's try to keep them short tonight.

865
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:16,160
Think about what your FUs of the week are now.

866
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,680
Think about what your FUs of the week

867
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,600
are now before the microphone gets to you.

868
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,280
Thank you.

869
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,280
Why am I still trying to pull up the terror mix of slag work? I do not know.

870
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,280
Okay, let's start it off with the only woman who can start this off, the FUs of the week.

871
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,280
I had aches at one moment, and now it's all gone.

872
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:45,280
Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is a fucked up.

873
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:19,280
the battle royale of the roads, with me as the victor, and them all lying in bloody, burned, ooh, a tank! Oh, that's right, I need a tank! Somebody give me a tank.

874
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:33,280
And my other fight goes toward, my birthday is on the 19th, okay? And I can't go do my normal thing that I do because I don't have money, so someone buy me the battle royale novel, thank you.

875
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:37,280
Alright, moving on, let's hear it from Loki.

876
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:40,280
Damn it, I missed...

877
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:43,280
I, like, forgot a lot of them. But that's alright, that's alright, that's alright.

878
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,280
Alright, uh, start it off.

879
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:50,280
Um, big eff you to the stupid bitch that was sitting next to us.

880
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:54,280
Actually, big bitch that was sitting next to us at the movie theater yesterday.

881
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:59,280
First off, there was plenty of other seats, but no, your fat ass had to move in front of us before the show.

882
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,280
We did before the show!

883
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,820
their statement of the kids that next to me too

884
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:05,260
and then they're fucking

885
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:07,560
after all that she

886
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:10,540
you know having your cell phone on during the movie and then they arrange

887
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:13,920
the evidence are talking to the public set up so i

888
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,840
and i hear it there with the fact

889
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,960
uh... began to offer to the stupid uh...

890
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,000
bastards that

891
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,280
drive cars in parking lot

892
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:27,740
when i get back out the fucking work your car behind mine

893
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:32,300
The next time you do that, I'm gonna back up at full speed and kill you.

894
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:35,840
That's it. Simple as that. Especially if you're just a pedestrian standing there,

895
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:39,300
that's even worse, so make it nice and easy for me to run over you.

896
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:40,660
So, um, yeah.

897
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:43,820
So don't get in my way in, uh, parking lots.

898
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:47,580
Stop distracting me to all this pencil crap!

899
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:48,460
Seriously!

900
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:49,820
Are you, are you done?

901
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:54,340
No, I'm not done! He bothered me!

902
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:56,380
Are you done now?

903
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,900
um...

904
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,660
for now because i can't remember

905
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:02,140
they'll come back

906
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:04,560
i have a few ideas of the week i'd like to get out

907
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:08,940
my first f u goes to daylight savings time

908
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:10,740
no it's my turn hold on

909
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:12,300
hold on we'll go back we'll go back

910
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:15,020
my first f u goes to daylight savings time what the fuck

911
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:16,700
an hour of sleep lost

912
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:19,960
because somebody decided we needed more suns so the children can play outdoors

913
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:23,980
uh... act like that you're killed rob not safe to play on actually because um...

914
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:28,820
you know, the year isn't exactly 365 days, and that there's an actual, you know, wait,

915
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:30,340
no, that's leap years. Never mind, I don't know.

916
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:34,800
I don't give a shit. It sucks my balls. Not every country celebrates it. Why do we have

917
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:46,120
to? I lost an hour of sleep. Lick me. Arizona rules. Okay. Uh, what else? Yeah, Arizona

918
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:51,340
doesn't celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day either. They're kind of fucked up. Um, uh,

919
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:56,960
else am I trying to think of? Oh, there was something else. FU to having a crush and not

920
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:08,960
knowing what to do with it. I hate that. FU to traffic. I hate cars. FU to... FU to zero.

921
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:14,600
He's looking at me funny. I'm just kidding. I couldn't think of anything else. Alright,

922
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:20,600
back to Logi. This is going to be an FU to pretty much everyone that was not competing

923
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:24,760
I don't put judges for here. I don't listen you stupid bastard

924
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:30,780
I worked hours on the fucking audio setup the reason you can't hear yourself the mic cuz you're whispering into the fucking mic

925
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:34,240
Talk loudly I did sound check so you can hear people

926
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:40,700
Yes, I can't hear myself because I'm talking really quietly turn it up turn it up speak louder. You stupid bastard

927
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:46,000
That news the guy that played Simon you really sucked you pushed out man

928
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
I like that guy. He was great.

929
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Well, he pussed out, man.

930
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
He was good, but had failure not had bronchitis.

931
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
He pussed out. I could have been a better Simon.

932
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
That's right. I would have hated everyone, so I guess I couldn't have done that.

933
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Well, there might be something involving American Idol on this station in the future.

934
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Who knows? Ideas are going around.

935
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Anyway, so F you tonight, and F you for eBay for having me addicted.

936
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I'm done.

937
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Alright, moving on. Let's go around the room. We'll start with, what? Let's start with Tal. He's over here. We'll go this way.

938
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Alright, Tal, kick it off. What's up?

939
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I'd like to give a nice fuck you to, oh, everybody who's ever gone to Scandia.

940
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Except for, you know, my friend, because we're intelligent people.

941
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
We know what English is. We speak it. We know how to read it.

942
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:37,000
We know what it means to be able to follow instructions. You know?

943
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Yes, this is the best background ever.

944
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,000
And I'd like to give a...

945
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Dude, there's some seriously retarded people out there. It's so scary.

946
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I want to know, just how many people, when we came back after the tournament,

947
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,000
while I was playing 2DX, how many people came up with that token machine?

948
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Put money in it. When it said, please use another changer.

949
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Dude, you know...

950
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
People are stupid and can't read.

951
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
And one person was like, oh my god, the machine stopped working.

952
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:11,360
And I stopped in my game and said, read the sign.

953
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:14,400
You know what area Scandia is located at, right?

954
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,320
You have to leave people who are illiterate there.

955
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:19,200
Yeah, but people are just as stupid who go to RVGL.

956
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:22,600
There's nothing that made me want to go back and get my college degree.

957
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:26,280
At least there are more retards at RVGL than at Scandia.

958
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,240
No, dude, seriously.

959
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:32,400
Until you work, there are retards that work in RVGL.

960
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:37,400
There's retards at Scandia, and then there's just people who expect other people to afford them at RNG.

961
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,400
And then it's like this, people at Scandia don't have a choice, the people at RNG don't do.

962
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,400
That isn't even worse.

963
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,400
It's usually, it boggles the brain.

964
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,400
And um, let's see, what else would I like to do next year?

965
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,400
Yes.

966
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:54,400
I'd like to give a nice big fakirigitaru, man, because I don't have it, and I really, really want it.

967
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,400
And it's like...

968
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:02,400
And, um, wait, God, I had a whole list of them today, but I don't remember, so I'll come back.

969
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:06,400
Wait, no, I won't. I'll keep this, because I'm on my court.

970
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,400
My turn!

971
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:15,400
Okay, uh, my first, my first lucky goes to being broke.

972
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:25,400
Because I have, like, I am, I had to live off $20 this weekend because that's, like, almost all I have left until I get more luck.

973
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:30,400
Fuck you to expiring ATM cards. I've had no money this weekend.

974
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,400
Okay, well...

975
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,400
It's still the chase, yeah.

976
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,400
Okay.

977
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:36,400
Now, uh...

978
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,400
Oh, yeah.

979
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:40,400
Okay, well, anyway, um, also...

980
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:43,400
Fuck you to bad grades.

981
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,400
Cause it sucks.

982
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,400
Shut up!

983
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,400
Hey, man.

984
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,400
I'm just fucking with you, man.

985
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,400
No more messing around, man.

986
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:51,400
And also...

987
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:54,400
Fuck my bike, because it got another flat tire.

988
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,400
Yeah, on my bike.

989
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,400
Yes.

990
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:04,400
And, the old GPAs for not having lights on them, I put one in.

991
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,400
Yes, I know about the afterburner, and I'm too cheap to get one.

992
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,400
So I just use a bike light under my chin.

993
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,400
I have like a light shielding, but it sucks.

994
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:36,800
Next time you guys go BAAAAA in the middle of a great song like Daikon-Kai, just kill

995
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:37,800
yourself first.

996
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:38,800
Oh, shut up.

997
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,800
Hey, Anita's here.

998
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:40,800
Hey, Anita.

999
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:41,800
Okay, Nick.

1000
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,800
Oh, hey, Anita's here, right, Anita?

1001
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,800
Okay, Nick.

1002
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:55,800
Fuck the judges for making me stop in the middle of my guacamole del taco routine.

1003
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:58,800
I was, like, 95% of the way done.

1004
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:00,800
Just because I was, like, failing my song.

1005
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,800
You know what? Sorry to cut you off. I fucking agree with that.

1006
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:05,800
You paid your money to be up there. It doesn't matter what other people think.

1007
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,800
You paid your money. You should get to do your dance.

1008
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,800
The gong is a stupid idea. And eat me.

1009
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,800
Thank you.

1010
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,800
I wish I had a dog.

1011
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,800
Fucking single and fuck the whole thing.

1012
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,800
And I agree with the whole crush thing.

1013
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:24,800
It's a bitch.

1014
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,800
Anyways, no, I got a few fucksies actually.

1015
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,800
Yeah, fuck you to the judges for stopping you.

1016
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,800
That pissed me off more than anything.

1017
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:34,800
I wanted to get up and start hitting people, then I want to get sent home.

1018
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:39,800
Fuck you to losing my voice after doing Orange Lounge all weekend last week.

1019
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:45,800
I couldn't talk for like two days afterwards, but it was fun.

1020
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,800
Zero's a hero!

1021
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,800
Shush!

1022
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:58,800
And uh, yeah, fuck you to the people who were making fun of the DDR Idol contestants because I really didn't see you guys get up there and do anything.

1023
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,800
Yeah, let's see you get some balls!

1024
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,800
Yeah, or something.

1025
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:06,800
I'm so in love with you

1026
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:10,800
Anyway, this is pointless. It's like microphone juggling. What?

1027
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,800
Thanks Lizzie for bailing me out earlier, it saved my life

1028
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:25,800
Yeah, fuck you to all those stupid bastards who pointed the fashion when I stumbled on a challenge that caused me to have a damn great day

1029
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:42,800
Yeah, fuck you to all the blondes in Scandia, well the customer blondes that aren't us. Yeah, they're all fucking jackasses that need to just go live at RBGL for a month.

1030
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:47,800
Um, yeah, fuck you being tired, and fuck you daylight time because I lost an hour.

1031
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:51,800
And fuck you for Battle Royale, and here's the reason why.

1032
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:57,800
We didn't see all the deaths. I wanted to see all of the apartment 40 deaths or whatever.

1033
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,800
I wanted to see each and every one of you in detail.

1034
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,800
How every one happened. Some of them you just hear they die.

1035
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:07,800
Huh? No, I want to get it. And I want to get the script too.

1036
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:12,800
And fuck you to trying to get your computer networked, because it never seems to happen.

1037
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,800
Did they get that done yet? Networking to computers?

1038
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,800
Okay, I'm done.

1039
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,800
Angel's turn, is it?

1040
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:34,800
Alright, I'd like to say, fuck you to jet lag, because I haven't been able to...

1041
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:41,800
Hey, hey! Hi, Floor! Thank you. Oh, it got really crazy! How nice!

1042
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:48,800
Alright, fuck you to Jetlag, because I haven't been able to get used to the time since I got back on Thursday.

1043
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:57,800
I haven't been getting any sleep. Ask Rob, because he knows that I only got 25 minutes of sleep last night.

1044
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:06,800
Well, wait, that doesn't help, because Black Lab, myself, and, uh, Dark Tetsuya, we're playing 2DX all night long, anyway.

1045
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:07,800
Game on you.

1046
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:14,800
Anyways, yeah, fuck you to Jetlag, and fuck you to, uh, Airplane Food, because it sucks.

1047
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,800
Not all the time, but this time it sucks.

1048
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:21,800
Alright.

1049
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,800
Big major fuck you to Trapper Jam.

1050
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:34,560
How the hell am I supposed to get from SACTO to Novato within 90 minutes if it's on a two-lane

1051
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:39,520
road, 35 miles per hour, bumper to bumper?

1052
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:42,600
That's why we were late.

1053
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:46,320
Fuck you, dude, you're just a pussy-ass, Simon.

1054
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:51,500
All of the judges, number one, were gonging DT.

1055
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,500
Or two.

1056
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,180
Simon actually passed me.

1057
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:57,180
And then this whole time.

1058
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:58,660
He just completely pushed out.

1059
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:01,140
Oh, that's fine.

1060
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:04,740
And I'm spinning.

1061
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:07,420
All right, let's move on.

1062
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:07,980
Yay.

1063
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:09,900
Well, we have the chat room FUs, so let's get

1064
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:10,820
to the chat room FUs.

1065
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:15,140
OK, we have Justin wants to say, F you to Friday night.

1066
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:17,580
No one at Scandia, and there was this girl playing DDR,

1067
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:20,180
and I was playing with her, but she had no idea how to play.

1068
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:22,940
And then I tried telling her, and she's like, well, I don't remember what she said.

1069
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:25,460
Something in Spanish, because she didn't even speak English.

1070
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:29,880
On a good note, I'm getting a free customized CD from LED Records, which is Judy Crystal,

1071
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:32,460
Maria Shore, Priscilla, and Rose's producer.

1072
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:35,700
And an F.U. to the troll lady I saw driving with missing teeth.

1073
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:37,980
Ehh!

1074
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:44,020
Ness151 would like to say a big, hearty F.U. to DDRCoralville for not giving free tokens,

1075
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:48,260
and to LegendOfMax and ParanoiaSurvivorMax for making me lose the feeling in my thumbs

1087
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:53,280
going to protest Mr. Rogers' funeral. They're saying that Mr. Rogers is going to burn in

1088
01:13:53,280 --> 01:14:00,040
hell because he was a sissy. These are those radical, they're those radical idiot people

The other people that I want to go after with shotguns just because-

1091
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:10,160
Oh my god, there's not a more godly person than Mr. Rogers ever. You can't possibly protest

1092
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:12,400
anything the band ever did.

1093
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:16,240
Terry, put that link up in the chatroom. They don't believe us, so put that link up and

1094
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:21,780

1095
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:28,240
I bet you, you put people like that who hide behind, you know, something that they've made

1096
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:32,160

that's mean and an F you to my cell phone because it's damn clip has to

1110
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:21,280
unclip when I'm running across a busy road so I have to go searching for it

1111
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:27,920
when I'm flipping out about it almost being run over rice princess would like

1112
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:32,240
to say fuck you to playing foundation of our love over and over again change the

1113
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:38,200
the song. Although she likes that song, I just used it to all hell. My bad. Alright,

1114
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:43,520
Vidpowah would like to say, F you to homework, F you to getting teacher recommendations.

1115
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:46,760
I always thought that was a good thing, but whatever. And F you to not being able to get

1116
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:50,700
the turntable on the right-hand side of BeatMania 2DX when I'm playing on first player, but

1117
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:56,640
other than that, 2DX is awesome. It's not that hard. It didn't work. Hit the white key.

1118
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:01,040
Then go to save. He did everything he said. I think it'll only work when you're playing

1119
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,040
I think that's what's going on.

1120
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:03,040
Oh, well, yeah.

1121
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:07,800
What, is he trying to do it by himself?

1122
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:08,800
I don't know.

1123
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:09,800
I have no idea.

1124
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:10,800
I'm sorry.

1125
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,800
Just use the second player side.

1126
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,120
Yeah, just do it on the two player side.

1127
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:16,120
There must be something.

1128
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:18,040
There's some greater scheme going on.

1129
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:19,040
I don't know.

1130
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,040
Anyway, that does it for the FUs of the week.

1131
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:24,400
Hooray, we're through it.

1132
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,560
I feel like just moving right on into the cage match.

1133
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,280
What do you guys say?

1134
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:29,280
Sure.

1135
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:30,280
Let's do that.

1136
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:32,280
I've got to cue some things up.

1137
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:36,280
Okay, that CD's all ready to go, but I need to cue up this CD as well.

1138
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:42,280
So, does anybody else have anything they'd like to say about the FUs of the Week while I'm trying to cue up some cage match things?

1139
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:44,280
No.

1140
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:47,280
No.

1141
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:50,280
We'll come up with something.

1142
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,280
I like traffic.

1143
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:53,280
Oh, wait, what?

1144
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:55,280
No!

1145
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:56,280
No!

1146
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:58,280
Throwing ferrets back and forth is fun.

1147
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:02,280
Yes, it is. Isn't it? Isn't it fun?

1148
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:04,280
Yes, isn't it fun, Loki?

1149
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:06,280
Isn't it fun?

1150
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:10,280
Oh, you were saying something? Sorry, I was playing with my watch.

1151
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:13,280
Ah, screw that.

1152
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:16,280
Where's the ferret? I want to throw it some more. Give me the ferret.

1153
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:19,280
It's only better.

1154
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:23,280
I stepped on my back and almost slipped as it fell.

1155
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:33,280
Irene's trying to tell me about a new segment on the show she thinks we should do. It's called Orange Crush, and I'm getting the information on this as she's telling me here.

1156
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:43,280
Basically, you ask Bamani trivia and see how many answers the person can come up with in 30 seconds. Okay, I like this so far. Keep going. Keep going. Yes. Yes.

1157
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:46,280
By the way, fuck these lights.

1158
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:56,920
okay I'm gonna okay that's it you just see how many trivia answers the person

1159
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:59,720
come up with three things that's a fabulous idea we'll have to do that one

1160
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:05,980
you know we actually have time to like prep trivia questions it's the

1161
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:09,880
microphone I have here we go into the cage match

1162
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:19,320

01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:27,680

1166
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:53,200
Here it is, here's a clip of last week's winner. Oh, the way the cage match works, we play three songs, we only play a clip of the song that won last time, and then you vote, and the song you vote as winner goes into rotation on Orange Lounge with Monty Music Amore, which plays all the time on this station when we're not here.

1167
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:58,200
If this guy is that lazy, that's the app.

1168
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:05,200
Here it is, this is Opera Trance with Spente and Lestelli, this is last week's winner and we're going to play just a clip of it.

1169
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:10,880
to be true

1170
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:21,880
What can I say?

1171
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:29,880
In a sua speranza prete

1172
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:34,880
La ca' la nace

1173
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:39,880
E das sua speranza preghe

1174
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,880
Ura storiga

1175
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:44,880
La maharo pianto

1176
01:19:44,880 --> 01:20:14,840
All right, that's last week's winner, or two weeks ago's winner.

1177
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:19,840
Okay, moving right along, let's go into Jamie's pick, shall we?

1178
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,840
Jamie, would you like to tell us about your pick?

1179
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,840
Um, no. Play it.

1180
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:26,840
Just play it? You don't even want to introduce it? You don't want to give them the name to vote for?

1181
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,840
Um, JB sent me this.

1182
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:31,840
JB sent you this, but do you want to even say what it is? Or is this just going to be Jamie's pick?

1183
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:36,840
The Wildside Queen of Love speed version, and I bet people will recommend it if it plays well tonight.

1184
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:42,840
Wild Side, Queen of Love, Speed Version. This is the second entry in the Orange Lounge cage match. Enjoy.

1185
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:17,840

1187
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,840
And I can never take up the night

I'm feeling, feeling good

1189
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:42,840
The streets of you are here with you

1190
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:44,840
It's plain to say you're the one for me

1191
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:45,840
But if you die, don't back down

1192
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:46,840
We're gonna shout it out

1193
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:47,840
We're gonna clap

1194
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:48,840
Hey!

1195
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:49,840
We gotta go, gotta go, gotta go

1196
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:50,840
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1197
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:52,840
We gotta go, gotta go, gotta go

1198
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:53,840
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1199
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:56,340
When you hear the magic melody

1200
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:59,340
When you hear it you will sing with me

1201
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:01,340
For they know what it is that you want

1202
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:03,840
And for you I'll be your big brother

1203
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:07,840
I'm gonna sing about you every day

1204
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,840
I'll bring you home for the day

I'll be your love

1207
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:18,840
My heart is locked

1208
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:20,340
Can't see it anymore

1209
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:21,840
It's a fight, I'm drunk

1210
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,340
I wanna get ahead

1211
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:31,420
I'm feeling beautiful, my heart is loud, I'm feeling dizzy,

1212
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:35,340
The light, the trust, I wanna get it, yeah

1213
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:41,340
I'm feeling beautiful, I'm feeling dizzy

1214
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:42,340
Yeah

1215
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:53,140
They scream so few, but here we're few

1216
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:54,740
It's plain to see you're the one who'll meet

1217
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:56,740
The words you call your side, two words that'll shout it out

1218
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:57,740
We're all about

1219
01:23:57,740 --> 01:23:58,740
Hey

1220
01:23:58,740 --> 01:23:59,740
Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go

1221
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:00,740
Hey, hey, hey

1222
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:02,740
Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go

1223
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:03,740
Hey, hey, hey

1224
01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:16,740
Yo, move, my heart, you know

1225
01:24:16,740 --> 01:24:17,740
It's beating, beating, move

1226
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:19,740
Just like a drum

1227
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:20,740
I wanna get it

1228
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:22,740
Move, move, some more

1229
01:24:22,740 --> 01:24:23,740
You know you never had

1230
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:24,740
Tonight, your love

1231
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:25,740
I'm feeling, feeling

1232
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:27,740
Move, my heart, you know

1233
01:24:27,740 --> 01:24:29,740
It's beating, beating, move

1234
01:24:29,740 --> 01:24:30,740
Just like a drum

1235
01:24:30,740 --> 01:24:32,740
I'm drunk, I wanna get you

1236
01:24:32,740 --> 01:24:33,740
Come on, come on

1237
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:35,740
You're not your never-ending

1238
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:36,740
I'm tonight with love

1239
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:39,740
I'm feeling, feeling good

1240
01:25:06,740 --> 01:25:36,140
All right, that is WildSide, who's—WildSide's been a pretty popular pick in the cage match

1241
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:46,140
Wildside has been in the cage match quite a little bit lately. That was Queen of Love, and you might have recognized that as being Baek Hwa from 3rd Korean.

1242
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:56,140
So, let's go around the room and see what everyone thought of Wildside, Queen of Love, starting with Puppy.

1243
01:25:56,140 --> 01:26:04,140
It sounded like the original version a lot. It's kind of a cool song, but I'd say a 7.5.

1244
01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:27,140
I think it's a big five, because it sucks, and I hate Wildside, and yeah, it sucked, the original was better, Wildside sucks, because they can't do any of their own songs, they just do covers and they suck ass, and PsyFam sucks as a piss-off baby.

1245
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:34,140
Okay, so that kind of does its side, but I definitely have it just against the wild side.

1246
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:37,140
I'll give it a four and a half. Angel?

1247
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:52,140
Uh, it did sound like a lot, uh, a lot like the original, but, uh, I don't know, it was alright. I'd say four.

1248
01:26:52,140 --> 01:27:18,140
I like it because my Itoko sent it to me. It gets a 12.

1249
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:28,140
But Quaz better, it really is, but it's not bad. I'd listen to that on a rainy day.

1250
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:31,140
I'd, uh, I'd give it a... seven?

1251
01:27:31,140 --> 01:27:34,140
Okay. So. Alright, my pick.

1252
01:27:34,140 --> 01:27:37,140
Um, I was gonna pick a different song. I was gonna pick a song.

1253
01:27:37,140 --> 01:27:40,140
Okay, last night at a party, this guy, Garrett, who's new in town that plays 2D-

1254
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:42,140
Well, he's not really new in town, actually. He's lived here his whole life.

1255
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:45,140
But he kind of just is- he's new to the Sac-Bomani scene.

1256
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:50,140
We saw him randomly playing 2DX one night, and we just kind of sucked him up into our little circle.

1257
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:53,140
And, uh, turns out he owns a copy of Amplitude.

1258
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:54,140
You haven't met him yet.

1259
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:57,140
Alright, um, he has Amplitude.

1260
01:27:57,140 --> 01:27:59,640
He brought that over to the little shindig we had last night.

1261
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:03,140
And there's a song on there I fuckin' love by Freezepop,

1262
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:04,640
called Sup-

1263
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:07,140
by, uh, it's called Supersprode by Freezepop.

1264
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:08,140
However!

1265
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:12,640
Can I talk- can I speak? Can I speak? Can I finish? Can I finish?

1266
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:14,140
No. Anyway.

1267
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:17,640
Uh, but I couldn't find a copy of Supersprode, which kinda sucks.

1268
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:22,640
But I did find another song by Freezepop that kicks a lot of ass, so this is my cage match pick for this week.

1269
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:30,640
This is Science Genius Girl, and this is my cage match pick from Freezepop, so enjoy!

1270
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:55,640
I want the science fair

1271
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:58,640
I wear a white black suit

1272
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:02,640
Here they stand with my hair

1273
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:05,640
When I close the human being

1274
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:09,640
It will want to hold my hand

1275
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:12,640
When I close the human being

1276
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:16,640
It will be a member of my band

1277
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:20,640
It will be, it will be

1278
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:23,640
It will be a member of my band

1279
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:26,640
Before I go to school

1280
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:30,640
It will be a member of my band

1281
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:49,640
Science is the method current, the theorems speak to me

1282
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:53,640
Microscope is in my hand

1283
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:57,640
Fun's welcome to a new screen

1284
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:04,640
When I close a human being It will want to hold my hand

1285
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:12,640
When I close a human being It will be a member of my band

1286
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:22,640
It will be a member of my band

1287
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:26,640
It will be the number of one hell

1288
01:30:52,640 --> 01:31:00,640
Measure out the chemicals, safety goggles on my eyes

1289
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:07,640
Turn the vents and burner on, my creation comes alive

1290
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:14,640
I have closed my human being, it is here and holds my hand

1291
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:25,640
I have closed my human being, It is now a member of my band.

1292
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:35,640
It is now a member of my band, It is now a member of my band.

1293
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:39,640
My man, I am not a human being

1294
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:42,640
It is you and not my man

1295
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:46,640
My man, I am not a human being

1296
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:50,640
It is now the number of my man

1297
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:18,640
That's what it gets.

1298
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:21,640
A weak burp for a weak tongue.

1299
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:28,640
Not good, not good, not good.

1300
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:30,640
Sorry Rob!

1301
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:32,640
Okay, three.

1302
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:42,640
I liked it except it was kinda making me fall asleep.

1303
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:44,640
Whatever, whatever.

1304
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:46,640
Okay, um...

1305
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:48,640
I like...

1306
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:50,640
Not your turn.

1307
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:55,640
Now you're going last, so you can wait, Angel.

1308
01:32:56,640 --> 01:33:00,640
I really did like the beat, but, you know...

1309
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:02,640
Okay, fine.

1310
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:04,640
Six. Zero.

1311
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:08,640
You know she just gave you that sportsy feel, dude.

1312
01:33:08,640 --> 01:33:12,400
no okay first of all i don't remember which fucking game that was from

1313
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:16,000
i don't care i must i really must not have paid attention to that crappy ass

1314
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,000
song okay i heard the fucking dwi to that and i

1315
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,800
thought it was cool for like negative four seconds it was cool before

1316
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:28,640
it started even though there was a dwi okay the best the best part about that

1317
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:34,160
song was when it ended i gave it a negative 80 million

1318
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:37,120
but don't worry rob though because you know that song that you were talking

1319
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:44,120
It's not Wildside and it's not the Ketchum song. I'll give it a 6.5.

1320
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:11,280
I mean and he would be better okay I just went this way I can see why it was

1321
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:14,720
in frequency because it probably cost nothing to license that's it sucks major

1322
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:22,880
ass so I'm giving it a 1 a 1 so I mean I know you people out there who just

1323
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:27,120
vote against my song because you try to piss me off I don't care because I'll

1324
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:33,720
come back stronger better faster oh yeah one last thing as for the previous song

1325
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:36,720
I enjoy this song very well. I give it an 8.

1326
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:48,720
I know this is really, really late and out of segment, but F you stupid AOL commercials, because I don't want to see an icon sleep with some ugly hoe. That's it.

1327
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:52,720
Okay, as late as that comment was, I'll ignore it.

1328
01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:54,720
Of course, because AOL's got a spree anyway.

1329
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:57,720
Yes?

1330
01:34:57,720 --> 01:34:58,720
Shut the hell up!

1331
01:34:58,720 --> 01:34:59,720
Speak!

1332
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:12,560

1333
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:18,840

1334
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:22,720

1335
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:26,760
bullshit and so you're gonna listen to me now okay first up freeze-pop science

1336
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:32,760
Science Genius Girl, a band out of Boston. They're playing modern new wave music from the Electroclash school of style, okay?

1337
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:34,760
They're mod-

1338
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:37,760
These guys fucking own you for free.

1339
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:39,760
This- no. Fuck you. Sit down.

1340
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:42,760
I'm gonna wait. I'll wait. I'm gonna wait. Go ahead. I'm gonna wait.

1341
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:47,760
Now check this out. Science Genius Girl is a brilliant composition.

1342
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:53,760
It's a really well made new wave song. It's a really well made modern industrial pop song, okay?

1343
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:58,640
The song is really cool, and it's fun. It's fun to play and make the game better and

1344
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:04,860
Yeah, shut the fuck up. You're like. You don't know what the hell you're talking about anyways because you're like. Oh my god. It sucks

1345
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:08,640
The thing is that okay, no hold on

1346
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:13,120
You know what the only reason why you know all this shit about this band is because you have to make up for how much they

1347
01:36:13,120 --> 01:36:14,840
fucking suck

1348
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:20,200
If they sucked I wouldn't care if they suck that you would care you're carried right now. They suck

1349
01:36:20,200 --> 01:36:23,200
Fuck! Listen to the song again!

1350
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:26,200
I have like seven remixes, I have their album!

1351
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:31,200
That's sad, did you find it like a five cent bin? Seriously!

1352
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:36,200
Seven remixes what? They had to take seven fucking times to make it right?

1353
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:39,200
You're a hoe man! You're a hoe!

1354
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:43,200
Well at least I can go through with my mother!

1355
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:45,200
Everyone shut up!

1356
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:47,200
Your dog was better!

1357
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:49,200
Thank you, now that you've all shut up...

1358
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:54,200
I've never seen a case match get so fucking heated.

1359
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:56,200
I just didn't like that one.

1360
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:58,200
That's why I wanted to get a burp.

1361
01:36:58,200 --> 01:37:03,200
Rob, the ketchup song? What in the hell did I miss in five weeks?

1362
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:06,200
Rob, do you have a hickey on your ass yet?

1363
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:09,200
From that side of the room, you got a hickey on your ass.

1364
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:12,200
Can we ask for the votes, please?

1365
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:16,200
Alright, let's recap what you can vote for.

1366
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:18,200
Oh my god.

1367
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:23,200
Forgive me for liking people like Fisher, Booter, and Freefall, man. I go to clubs like that.

1368
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:25,200
No one else gives a microphone!

1369
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:30,200
The chat room says Cage Match is turning into an actual Cage Match. Time to vote!

1370
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:34,200
Okay, your first song you can vote for. Here's a clip.

1371
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:37,200
Opera Trance, Bente Lestelli, last week's winner.

1372
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:49,200
All right, next one you can vote for, Wild Side, Queen of Love.

1373
01:37:49,200 --> 01:38:05,200
All right, last one, the ever controversial Freeze Pop with Science Genius Girl.

1374
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:14,200
A member of my band, a member of my band

1375
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:38,200
Put your ass down in that chair and drink your goddamn tea.

1376
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:42,200
Yeah, I put it in my head, chair, or tea.

1377
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:46,200
It's a Final Fantasy quote. It's the best video game quote ever.

1378
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:48,200
It's sin.

1379
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:55,200
Dead air! Yay!

1380
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:01,200
Sorry, I had to type that out for the chat rooms. I could see what they could move for.

1381
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:03,200
Let's get a break so that, like, Sam first can calm down.

1382
01:39:03,200 --> 01:39:06,000
okay let's go to break there but it's going to be doing some yoga

1383
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,120
it was interesting to know that i don't like turning into wonderland

1384
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:11,520
work and is now

1385
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:14,360
we let let lucky i'm sorry

1386
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:16,080
yes i will bring up yet

1387
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:18,080
yes

1388
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:19,080
and i think

1389
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:20,720
more than the pressing

1390
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:21,600
they'll be

1391
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:23,920
now i was going to talk about how hard

1392
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:27,920
this uh... actually monday we have to put my dog down

1393
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:30,440
all

1394
01:39:30,440 --> 01:39:32,200
yeah

1395
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:34,200
She's not seven million years old, she was fourteen.

1396
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:35,200
No.

1397
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:42,920
No, we had to put my dog to sleep, so we buried her up in Placerville area, up at some lake

1398
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:46,640
or something, and then between these trees we gave her her blanket, and...

1399
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:51,800
Stop hitting me with your fucking keys!

1400
01:39:51,800 --> 01:40:00,200
And then we put her, like, bone and stuff in there, so that was kind of sad.

1401
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:01,200
Alright.

1402
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:05,200
At least you didn't take pictures like Oolong.

1403
01:40:05,200 --> 01:40:07,200
No, not that I'm aware of.

1404
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:11,200
Good. I would be wondering about your sanity.

1405
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:13,200
But I'm sorry about your dog.

1406
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:15,200
That's alright.

1407
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:18,200
For me, who doesn't like dogs, I liked your dog.

1408
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:22,200
She was cool. But she was old and she was in pain, so we decided...

1409
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:27,200
I mean, she didn't die naturally. We just took her to the vet to have her go to sleep because she was in pain.

1410
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:40,200
She's been walking, her back legs are going paralyzed, and she had cysts all over the place, and probably cysts on the inside of her, and she was having trouble breathing, and all that wonderful stuff, so we're just like, okay, we're just gonna stay on it.

1411
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:44,200
It was hard having to say goodbye to her, though, before I had to go to work.

1412
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:45,200
Oh?

1413
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:47,200
I had to say a final goodbye.

1414
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:48,200
Sad.

1415
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:49,200
Okay.

1416
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:54,200
Well, okay, before we turn, now we've gone from Jerry Springer to Depression Hour.

1417
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:56,200
Now it's Oprah.

1418
01:40:56,200 --> 01:41:01,100
Okay, but we're gonna play some, we're gonna cool down tempers by playing some mellow

1419
01:41:01,100 --> 01:41:07,540
songs. We're gonna play some mellow things. So, we will be back, and we're gonna play

1420
01:41:07,540 --> 01:41:11,980
a fun game when we come back. We're gonna play a game. Is it called Science genius girl

1421
01:41:11,980 --> 01:41:18,980

1422
01:41:18,980 --> 01:41:20,980
Hey, nope, nope, hold on.

1423
01:41:23,980 --> 01:41:25,980
Alright, I want to see, I want to see a hug.

1424
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:26,980
I want to see a hug.

1425
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:28,980
I'm not going to break until we see a hug.

1426
01:41:28,980 --> 01:41:29,980
I want to see a hug.

1427
01:41:30,980 --> 01:41:31,980
Come on.

1428
01:41:31,980 --> 01:41:33,980
There we, aww, there we go.

1429
01:41:33,980 --> 01:41:35,980
Hey, now that was nice.

1430
01:41:35,980 --> 01:41:37,980
All right, here's a break.

Nibori Usuku

1434
01:44:14,420 --> 01:44:21,420
I'll be waiting for you in the morning

1435
01:44:21,420 --> 01:44:27,420
I'll be waiting for you in the morning

1436
01:44:27,420 --> 01:44:29,420
Bye, D!

1437
01:44:57,420 --> 01:45:02,420
We are instead of doom

1438
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:08,420
And now, open your eyes and see

1439
01:45:08,420 --> 01:45:11,420
What we have made is real

1440
01:45:11,420 --> 01:45:18,420
We are instead of doom

1441
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:23,420
And I never want to stay, but I love you with me

1442
01:45:23,420 --> 01:45:25,420

I'm going to play one more song because things are a little chaotic right now.

1448
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:23,260
We're still trying to set up for match games, so enjoy one more mellow song, and then we'll

1449
01:46:23,260 --> 01:46:24,260
be right back.

There we go.

1485
01:50:40,860 --> 01:50:41,860
Skyline gets it right.

1486
01:50:41,860 --> 01:50:42,860
So we have our two contestants.

1487
01:50:42,860 --> 01:50:44,860
Snub destroyed in Skyline DC-505.

1488
01:50:44,860 --> 01:50:58,780
5.05. The answer is 5.73. And Vidpower was so close he said 5.72. Poor guy. And then

1489
01:50:58,780 --> 01:51:08,420

1490
01:51:08,420 --> 01:51:13,740
Skyline. Okay, now we've got a whole mess of celebrities. We have so many people in

1491
01:51:13,740 --> 01:51:15,740
And here we've had to tag team some folks.

1492
01:51:15,740 --> 01:51:22,460
OK, so let's go around and, oh, you know what?

have the match game music queued up.

1496
01:51:26,860 --> 01:51:29,220
So somebody needs to explain how match game works, please,

01:51:33,380 --> 01:51:40,060
Actually, yes, basically, Rob will read off the phrase to you.

1501
01:51:40,060 --> 01:51:43,260
And then there's going to be a blank at the end of the phrase.

1502
01:51:43,260 --> 01:51:51,060

Just do the game, dammit!

1519
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:10,040
Now Jamie's yelling at me! I can't take it!

1520
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:12,040
Ow, she kicked me!

1521
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:18,040
I cry. Alright, first question. I'm gonna have my revenge, because Jamie tonight is in two questions.

1522
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:24,040
Alright, but first we're gonna do a question about Angel.

1523
01:53:24,040 --> 01:53:26,040
Here we go.

1524
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:28,040
Please don't yell, I have to ask him not to yell.

1525
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:30,040
Jamie, you have a headache.

1526
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:32,320
Here we go.

1527
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:34,080
Where did the music go?

1528
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:35,640
It went to hell.

1529
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:36,740
All right, here we go.

1530
01:53:36,740 --> 01:53:39,840
Angel was very excited to be back from Japan.

1531
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:42,360
And her buddies in SAKTO were excited to watch

1532
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:45,480
her carry two big bags of souvenirs through the door

1533
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:47,240
to her welcome home party.

1534
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:49,560
But they were all shocked to find that the bags were

1535
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:50,960
full of nothing but blank.

1536
01:53:55,600 --> 01:53:58,320
Angel was very excited to be back from Japan.

1537
01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:03,040
And her buddies in SACTO were excited to watch her carry two big bags of souvenirs through

1538
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:04,920
the door to her welcome home party.

1539
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:17,200
But they were shocked to find that the bags were full of nothing but blank.

1540
01:54:17,200 --> 01:54:23,280
I'm waiting on both contestants to give me an answer.

1541
01:54:23,280 --> 01:54:30,280
Alright, there's one answer locked in. I'm waiting on one more answer. Angel carried

1542
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:37,320
in two bags full of blankets. Don't give your answers aloud, please. Alright, I think we

1543
01:54:39,420 --> 01:54:44,320
have our other contestant locked in. Jesus Christ, it's going to be one of those days.

1544
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:51,080
Okay, we have one of those contestants on the show tonight. Alright, yes, I'm just going

1545
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:53,080
I have to warn you all, we have one of those contestants.

1546
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:55,080
Okay, everybody locked in in the room.

1547
01:54:55,080 --> 01:54:57,080
Yes, okay, here we go.

1548
01:54:57,080 --> 01:55:00,080
Should I read the contestants first, or us first?

1549
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:01,080
Contestants first, okay.

1550
01:55:01,080 --> 01:55:06,080
Snupdisphonoid says, Angel was excited to be back from Japan.

1551
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:11,080
Her buddies in Sato were excited to watch her carry two big bags of souvenirs through the door to her welcome home party.

1552
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:17,080
But, they were shocked to find that the bags were full of nothing but dead babies covered in feces.

1553
01:55:17,080 --> 01:55:20,080
Ew!

1554
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:24,840
Shame on you, Angel! What about the babies?

1555
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:28,880
SkylineDC505 says

1556
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:32,240
two bags full of nothing but pakari sweat.

1557
01:55:32,240 --> 01:55:36,440
I got pakari sweat. Which is kind of ironic because in reality, yeah,

1558
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:40,680
she did bring a little pakari sweat.

1559
01:55:40,680 --> 01:55:44,600
I have my answer. Alright, let's go around the room and see if we have any matches. Jamie,

1560
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:47,720
what was your answer? Two bags full of nothing but

1561
01:55:47,720 --> 01:55:53,600
uh... metal collars tickets to deserted island metal collars and tickets to a

1562
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:56,820
deserted island i'm sorry it's not a match

1563
01:55:56,820 --> 01:56:03,820
all right moving on angel and maggots what did you guys come up with

1564
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:07,040
fair enough bags full of what else? Propel

1565
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:08,320
Propel!

1566
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:11,220
very close but not a match

1567
01:56:11,220 --> 01:56:13,340
not a match sorry puppy

1568
01:56:13,340 --> 01:56:14,700
two bags full of

1569
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:28,100
Yowie. Yowie! No, I'm sorry. Uh, Loki, two bags full of? Iraqi suicide bombers. I don't

1570
01:56:28,100 --> 01:56:32,940
even know where you can find those in Japan, but whatever. Okay, zero. They're out there.

1571
01:56:32,940 --> 01:56:39,660
Get them out of vending machines. Zero. They're imported. Um, unlucky and super lucky weapons

1572
01:56:39,660 --> 01:56:41,660
to distribute randomly.

1573
01:56:41,660 --> 01:56:43,660
Unlucky and super lucky weapons to distribute randomly.

1574
01:56:43,660 --> 01:56:44,660
No, I'm sorry.

1575
01:56:44,660 --> 01:56:46,660
See, I was going to say the same thing of Jamie,

1576
01:56:46,660 --> 01:56:49,660
but I knew that she was going to say something about Royale Real.

1577
01:56:49,660 --> 01:56:51,660
So I went with the other great import.

1578
01:56:51,660 --> 01:56:56,660
A bag full of Chairman Kaga's uniform from Iron Chef.

1579
01:56:56,660 --> 01:56:57,660
Iron Chef uniform.

1580
01:56:57,660 --> 01:56:58,160
All right.

1581
01:56:58,160 --> 01:56:59,660
Let's put used underwear.

1582
01:56:59,660 --> 01:57:01,160
I was going to say soiled panties,

1583
01:57:01,160 --> 01:57:04,660
but then I thought some people might take that the wrong way.

1584
01:57:04,660 --> 01:57:16,660
My answer is she brought in two bags full of hentai. Sorry. Not a match. Sorry. All right. So the scores...

1585
01:57:16,660 --> 01:57:33,660
The scores... That is awful. I am so glad that it got picked up on the mic. Oh my God. I never said they were adults. They could be babies.

1586
01:58:03,660 --> 01:58:06,860
because all three of us are getting very irritated at

1587
01:58:06,860 --> 01:58:10,640
the shitty service provided to Saturday money dot com by the incompetent web

1588
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:13,260
hosts at one dollar hosting dot com

1589
01:58:13,260 --> 01:58:20,260
they decided to mail them a nice big box full of blank

1590
01:58:21,700 --> 01:58:25,660
the three folks that run sack the money dot com were getting very irritated

1591
01:58:25,660 --> 01:58:28,780
by the incompetent web host at one dollar hosting dot com

1592
01:58:28,780 --> 01:58:35,780
they decided to mail them a nice big box full of blank.

1593
01:58:35,780 --> 01:59:03,780
I'm going to mail him a nice, big box full of blank.

1594
01:59:03,780 --> 01:59:15,460
I think we're going to do that, too.

1595
01:59:15,460 --> 01:59:19,700
You're going to get a point just for that answer.

1596
01:59:19,700 --> 01:59:20,940
Is everybody locked in in the room?

1597
01:59:20,940 --> 01:59:22,340
All right, here we go.

1598
01:59:22,340 --> 01:59:26,740
The three folks that run sacbomani.com were getting very irritated by the incompetent

1599
01:59:26,740 --> 01:59:28,700
web host at $1hosting.com.

1600
01:59:28,700 --> 01:59:35,700
decided to mail them a nice big box full of. SkylineDC505 says, AOL CDs.

1601
01:59:35,700 --> 01:59:40,060
Brilliant. Brilliant. Here's another brilliant one. This is the one I was laughing at. Snubdicinoid

1602
01:59:40,060 --> 01:59:47,060
says, shitty magazines from March Madness. We had a big box of old video game magazines

1603
01:59:48,780 --> 01:59:52,260
you were giving away. It's a great answer. It's fucking genius. All right, let's see

1604
01:59:52,260 --> 01:59:56,100
if there are any matches. Here we go, Jamie.

1605
01:59:56,100 --> 02:00:03,100
I would send them in a box, the severed heads belonging to their head tech with a grenade in his mouth.

1606
02:00:12,100 --> 02:00:13,100
Poopy!

1607
02:00:13,100 --> 02:00:29,780

02:00:54,540 --> 02:00:59,540
Zero, a nice big box full of stinky shit and jizz.

1610
02:00:59,540 --> 02:01:02,540
Stinky shit and jizz, lovely.

1611
02:01:02,540 --> 02:01:03,540
All right.

1612
02:01:03,540 --> 02:01:04,540
Brand name of choice.

1613
02:01:04,540 --> 02:01:05,540
The brand name of choice.

1614
02:01:05,540 --> 02:01:06,540
Tell.

1615
02:01:06,540 --> 02:01:10,540
Actually, I was just thinking, you know, we should be nice to them.

1616
02:01:10,540 --> 02:01:11,540
They're friendly people.

1617
02:01:11,540 --> 02:01:13,540
They host our site on occasion.

1618
02:01:13,540 --> 02:01:21,540
And so I'm thinking, you know, a nice box full of cyanide-laced cupcakes.

1619
02:01:21,540 --> 02:01:22,540
Cyanide-laced cupcakes.

1620
02:01:22,540 --> 02:01:23,540
Beautiful.

1621
02:01:23,540 --> 02:01:31,540
I'm sorry. All right. I said that we decided to mail them a nice big box full of man porn.

1622
02:01:31,540 --> 02:01:41,540
Mark, return to sender, return to sender. Boy, oh boy. That was clever. All right. No

1650
02:06:18,980 --> 02:06:22,940
silly intern. Last night when he was asked to go help shop for snacks, his friends were

1661
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:56,220

please don't make us clean up your blank

1664

the march madness tournament in sacramento is such a great success with

1665
02:07:07,580 --> 02:07:09,680
a special message to all those of you

1666

All right.

1668
02:07:42,680 --> 02:07:49,680
Very simple answer, locked in.

1669
02:07:49,680 --> 02:07:52,680
Waiting on one more. Waiting on one more contestant.

1670
02:07:52,680 --> 02:07:55,680
Next time, please don't make us clean up your blank.

1671
02:07:55,680 --> 02:07:56,680
Mm, tastes like Korea.

1672
02:07:56,680 --> 02:07:59,680
Are all the contestants, are all the celebrities locked in?

1673
02:07:59,680 --> 02:08:04,680
Yes. Yeah? Oh, puppy's almost done.

1674
02:08:04,680 --> 02:08:06,680
Okay.

1675
02:08:06,680 --> 02:08:08,680
Puppy, you in?

1676
02:08:08,680 --> 02:08:14,680
He's writing, he's writing, he's writing, writing, writing, still writing, writing.

1677
02:08:14,680 --> 02:08:20,680
And, and, and he is almost done.

1678
02:08:20,680 --> 02:08:23,680
He's done. All right, there he goes. Put it down. All right.

1679
02:08:23,680 --> 02:08:25,680
Wait, did they send new answers?

1680
02:08:25,680 --> 02:08:26,680
Okay, fine.

1681
02:08:26,680 --> 02:08:27,680
Okay, here we go.

1682
02:08:27,680 --> 02:08:28,680
The contestants said,

1683
02:08:28,680 --> 02:08:30,680
The March Madness Tournament in Sacramento was such a great success,

1684
02:08:30,680 --> 02:08:33,680
but a special message to all those of you that came out and participated.

1685
02:08:33,680 --> 02:08:36,680
Next time, please don't make us clean up your snub.

1686
02:08:36,680 --> 02:08:39,420
This noise says, poop.

1687
02:08:39,420 --> 02:08:42,020
Please don't make us clean up your poop.

1688
02:08:42,020 --> 02:08:44,700
Skyline says, please don't make us clean up your crap.

1689
02:08:47,660 --> 02:08:50,980
Now, there is a difference between crap and poop.

1690
02:08:50,980 --> 02:08:52,220
Crap could be anything.

1691
02:08:52,220 --> 02:08:54,420
Crap could actually mean crap, or crap

1692
02:08:54,420 --> 02:08:56,660
could mean your stuff that you left running around.

1693
02:08:56,660 --> 02:08:58,140
Poop is pretty narrow.

1694
02:08:58,140 --> 02:09:01,420
There's only one thing that could be considered poop.

1695
02:09:01,420 --> 02:09:02,100
It depends.

1696
02:09:02,100 --> 02:09:04,260
Well, there's several animals that could have pooped.

1697
02:09:04,260 --> 02:09:05,700
But poop is poop.

1698
02:09:05,700 --> 02:09:09,980
crap could be poop, plus several other things, so I think Skyline has the edge on this, but

1699
02:09:09,980 --> 02:09:16,960
we'll see, we'll see. Let's go around and see the answers. Jamie, please next time,

1700
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:20,280
don't make us clean up your... Blood from their jugular veins is their college

1701
02:09:20,280 --> 02:09:45,040
p0k3smot42o

1702
02:10:15,040 --> 02:10:22,040
I said, don't make us clean up your shitty shorts after the judges review a new one.

1703
02:10:22,040 --> 02:10:25,040
Shitty shorts after the judges review a new one. Isn't that lovely?

1704
02:10:25,040 --> 02:10:29,040
Lo and behold, will this be my answer? Don't make us clean up your crap.

1705
02:10:29,040 --> 02:10:38,040
Don't make us clean up your crap. You said crap. That is an exact match. An exact match with Skyline. Beautiful.

1706
02:10:38,040 --> 02:10:42,040
Now it's 2-0. Well, let's see if Snub Distantly can catch up here.

1707
02:10:42,040 --> 02:10:48,040
I said, please don't make us clean up your sweat.

1708
02:10:48,040 --> 02:10:54,040
Because you guys sweat a lot when you play DDR and you need to wear deodorant. Okay.

1709
02:10:54,040 --> 02:10:56,040
Alright.

1710
02:10:56,040 --> 02:11:00,040
So, two points for Skyline and no points for Snub.

1711
02:11:00,040 --> 02:11:04,040
But that's okay, Snub. Here's your chance. Here is your chance to catch up.

1712
02:11:04,040 --> 02:11:08,040
And you've been bitching about the Battle Royale references all night long.

1713
02:11:08,040 --> 02:11:10,540
Well, here you go. This last question is just for you to catch up.

1714
02:11:10,540 --> 02:11:12,040
Okay, here we go.

1715
02:11:12,040 --> 02:11:15,040
Jamie, I promised two questions about Jamie.

1716
02:11:15,040 --> 02:11:19,040
Jamie won the Bimani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night.

1717
02:11:19,040 --> 02:11:21,040
Her secret weapon was her blank.

1718
02:11:34,040 --> 02:11:38,040
Jamie won the Bamani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night.

1719
02:11:39,040 --> 02:11:41,040
Her secret weapon was her blank.

1720
02:11:41,040 --> 02:11:49,800
Snub, this is your last chance to catch up. Make it good.

1721
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:57,320
Alright, we have one contestant locked in. Ooh, excellent answer, excellent, excellent

1722
02:11:57,320 --> 02:12:02,480
answer from that contestant. Too bad we're not as smart as the contestants.

1723
02:12:02,480 --> 02:12:09,480

02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:16,480

1730
02:12:30,200 --> 02:12:33,200
I was just letting you know what you said.

1731
02:12:50,200 --> 02:12:52,200
I hate you just this once.

1732
02:12:52,200 --> 02:12:54,200
You just work like that much.

1733
02:12:54,200 --> 02:12:56,200
I hate you so much.

1734
02:12:56,200 --> 02:12:57,200
Oh, that hurt!

1735
02:12:57,200 --> 02:12:57,700

02:12:57,700 --> 02:12:58,700
Alright, here we go, here we go.

1737
02:13:02,700 --> 02:13:04,200
Contestants, here we go.

1738
02:13:04,200 --> 02:13:06,200
Snub's gotta catch up, and here's his answer.

1739
02:13:06,200 --> 02:13:09,200
Jamie won the Bamani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night.

1740
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:12,700
Her secret weapon was her remote collar exploder dealie.

1741
02:13:13,700 --> 02:13:14,700
Good answer.

1742
02:13:15,200 --> 02:13:16,200
Okay.

1743
02:13:16,200 --> 02:13:20,700
Jamie won the Bamani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night.

1744
02:13:20,700 --> 02:13:22,200
Her secret weapon was her,

1745
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:23,700
Skyline says,

1746
02:13:23,700 --> 02:13:30,780
Oh, he changed his answer. I think his first answer was better. He said orange bat, which

1747
02:13:30,780 --> 02:13:38,340
is a great answer, but he changed it. His new answer is boom stick. So we have remote

1748
02:13:38,340 --> 02:13:43,300
collar, exploder, dealie, and boom stick. Alright, Jamie, what's your answer?

1749
02:13:43,300 --> 02:13:49,220
Orange bat. Orange bat. I knew it too. That's right. You're

1750
02:13:49,220 --> 02:13:54,220
already in the lead, Skyline, you don't need it. Alright, as Snub goes, yes, I still have

1751
02:13:54,220 --> 02:13:59,540
a chance. Okay, our tag team, lovely tag team of Magus and Angel. Big black cock. Her big

1752
02:13:59,540 --> 02:14:09,540
black cock. Dun, dun, dun! Sorry, that's not a match. But funny, Puppy. The ferret! The

1753
02:14:09,540 --> 02:14:15,540
Good answer, but not a match.

1754
02:14:15,540 --> 02:14:20,540
Loki, her secret weapon was her...

1755
02:14:20,540 --> 02:14:25,540
Iraqi suicide babies.

1756
02:14:25,540 --> 02:14:27,540
Iraqi suicide babies.

1757
02:14:27,540 --> 02:14:29,540
Jamie, is this true?

1758
02:14:29,540 --> 02:14:32,540
I admit it, I've been exporting them.

1759
02:14:32,540 --> 02:14:36,540
I keep them in my trunk.

1760
02:14:36,540 --> 02:14:40,540
Alright, in your trunks. Dear God, what about the children? What about the children? Alright, moving on.

1761
02:14:40,540 --> 02:14:44,540
Uh, zero! Her paper plate. Her paper plate! The real answer!

1762
02:14:44,540 --> 02:14:48,540
The true one! And the magic marker.

1763
02:14:48,540 --> 02:14:52,540
Alright.

1764
02:14:52,540 --> 02:14:56,540
And the damn candlestick she jabbed me in the head with.

1765
02:14:56,540 --> 02:15:00,540
Alright. In the study with Colonel Mustard.

1766
02:15:00,540 --> 02:15:04,540
Here we go. Um, Dave, who's filling in for Shiva.

1767
02:15:04,540 --> 02:15:08,540
Yeah, her secret weapon was her extremely high-pitched voice.

1768
02:15:10,540 --> 02:15:11,540
No!

1769
02:15:11,540 --> 02:15:12,540
My carrot!

1770
02:15:12,540 --> 02:15:13,540
Ahh!

1771
02:15:13,540 --> 02:15:14,540
Ahh!

1772
02:15:14,540 --> 02:15:15,540
Ahh!

1773
02:15:15,540 --> 02:15:16,540
Ahh!

1774
02:15:16,540 --> 02:15:17,540
Ahh!

1775
02:15:17,540 --> 02:15:20,540
Shatter, shatter, shatter.

1776
02:15:20,540 --> 02:15:21,540
I'm surprised.

1777
02:15:21,540 --> 02:15:23,540
That reminds me of a story you told me earlier this week,

1778
02:15:23,540 --> 02:15:26,540
and I'm surprised it was not your nephew of the week.

1779
02:15:26,540 --> 02:15:27,540
You bitch!

1780
02:15:27,540 --> 02:15:28,540
All right.

1781
02:15:28,540 --> 02:15:32,540
Anyway, my answer, yeah, I got carrot.

1782
02:15:32,540 --> 02:15:36,540
For the record, Jamie does sound like a younger person on the phone.

1783
02:15:36,540 --> 02:15:41,540
Okay, fuck you. I have to get to that. I have to do another fuck you after this.

1784
02:15:41,540 --> 02:15:43,540
After the break.

1785
02:15:48,540 --> 02:15:53,540
But you know what? It just goes to show that looks can be deceiving.

1786
02:15:53,540 --> 02:15:56,540
Because she's pure evil.

1787
02:15:56,540 --> 02:15:59,540
Alright, my answer. Let's finish this damn thing up.

1788
02:15:59,540 --> 02:16:06,540
Only three people are going to get this joke, but I said Jamie won because of her cocksnacks.

1789
02:16:09,900 --> 02:16:16,900
Cocksnacks. Alright. Skyline, two points. Snub, zero points. Skyline

1790
02:16:17,740 --> 02:16:23,740
is the winner! Yay! And what does Skyline win, Jamie?

1791
02:16:23,740 --> 02:16:51,020
p0k3smot42o

1792
02:17:21,020 --> 02:17:28,980

1793
02:17:28,980 --> 02:17:36,500
you can't talk to my mother and as like my number one pet peeve okay and so um

1794
02:17:36,500 --> 02:17:40,780
he's like what are you 12 is that anyway for a little girl to talk let us

1795
02:17:40,780 --> 02:17:49,100
it's your mother I'm like like oh yeah go to hell and opt me out and hung up on

1796
02:17:49,100 --> 02:17:53,100
Opt me out being the way that, you know, they don't call you back.

1797
02:17:53,100 --> 02:17:54,100
Those who don't know.

1798
02:17:54,100 --> 02:17:58,100
If you want to get rid of a telemarketer, ask them to help you out.

1799
02:17:58,100 --> 02:18:00,100
That was Story Time with Jamie, everybody.

1800
02:18:00,100 --> 02:18:01,100
Yay!

1801
02:18:01,100 --> 02:18:06,100
Normally, I'm really not that bad with telemarketers because, you know, Dan had to do that for

1802
02:18:06,100 --> 02:18:07,100
a little while.

1803
02:18:07,100 --> 02:18:08,100
Uh-huh.

1804
02:18:08,100 --> 02:18:12,100
And I'm really, I'm really patient with them usually, but that is my number one pet peeve

1805
02:18:12,100 --> 02:18:13,100
as people tell him.

1806
02:18:13,100 --> 02:18:14,100
You remember in Undersedation?

1807
02:18:14,100 --> 02:18:15,100
Mm-hmm.

1808
02:18:15,100 --> 02:18:16,100
Dude, all of you.

1809
02:18:16,100 --> 02:18:19,100
So you get to fuck YouTube, but not recently.

1810
02:18:19,100 --> 02:18:20,100
Hey, you should have done this to me.

1811
02:18:20,100 --> 02:18:22,100
Oh, hold on just one second.

1812
02:18:22,100 --> 02:18:23,100
Hi.

1813
02:18:23,100 --> 02:18:25,100
Uh, fuck yourself in.

1814
02:18:25,100 --> 02:18:27,100
Okay, I'll put it this way.

1815
02:18:27,100 --> 02:18:29,100
I know you guys hate telemarkers,

1816
02:18:29,100 --> 02:18:32,100
but I remember when I had to do telemarketing,

1817
02:18:32,100 --> 02:18:35,100
we hated more than you guys hate us having to do it.

1818
02:18:35,100 --> 02:18:38,100
It's totally tedious work, and it's stupid,

1819
02:18:38,100 --> 02:18:40,100
and people hate you because you have to call them

1820
02:18:40,100 --> 02:18:45,100
without your job, and it really sucks us.

1821
02:18:45,100 --> 02:18:46,100
He was rude, though.

1822
02:18:46,100 --> 02:18:47,100
Yeah.

1823
02:18:47,100 --> 02:18:52,100
Well, yeah, it was just like, you know, like, we hate doing it more than you guys hate us

1824
02:18:52,100 --> 02:18:54,860
calling you at six o'clock right when you're in the middle of dinner.

1825
02:18:54,860 --> 02:18:58,860
Like, the best time is when you're calling when people are saying grace for dinner, because

1826
02:18:58,860 --> 02:19:01,140
you'll hear Jesus Christ come out of their mouth.

1827
02:19:01,140 --> 02:19:03,300
It's the best thing ever.

1828
02:19:03,300 --> 02:19:04,300
No.

1829
02:19:04,300 --> 02:19:07,260
Or after they're done watching the ring.

1830
02:19:07,260 --> 02:19:11,140
Normally, like I said, I'm fine with telemarketers.

1831
02:19:11,140 --> 02:19:14,020
I'm normally, you know, just fine as I can be with them.

1832
02:19:14,020 --> 02:19:18,020
I don't sound like I'm twelve. I don't know how I sound like I'm twelve.

1833
02:19:18,020 --> 02:19:22,020
Even when I'm happy. Do I sound like I'm twelve when I'm happy?

1834
02:19:22,020 --> 02:19:24,020
Shut up, Robin.

1835
02:19:24,020 --> 02:19:27,020
I didn't say a goddamn thing. I'm just looking at you.

1836
02:19:27,020 --> 02:19:30,020
I'm gonna go now. I have to go back.

1837
02:19:30,020 --> 02:19:34,020
Jamie's gonna go make a gift, and in the meantime, we're gonna play some gifts for you.

1838
02:19:34,020 --> 02:19:37,020
When we come back, we're gonna talk to Jonas.

1839
02:19:37,020 --> 02:19:39,020
Because Jonas is here. Say hi, Jonas.

1840
02:19:39,020 --> 02:19:41,020
What up, yo?

1841
02:19:41,020 --> 02:19:45,820
And I think, Jamie, how about some Ask Orange Lounge, what do you think?

1842
02:19:45,820 --> 02:19:47,140
Why not?

1843
02:19:47,140 --> 02:19:50,180
I did not have that light switch installed so you could have a light switch rave.

1844
02:19:50,180 --> 02:19:52,180
Light switch rave!

1845
02:19:52,180 --> 02:19:59,980
When we come back, Ask Orange Lounge, and there's lots of people to ask tonight.

1846
02:19:59,980 --> 02:20:06,660
You can ask Sky, you can ask Loki, you can ask Dark Sakura, or you can ask DDR Angel,

1847
02:20:06,660 --> 02:20:08,380
Who's back from Japan?

1848
02:20:08,380 --> 02:20:15,620
You can ask 23rd Magus and DDR Angel if you are so inclined to ask a personal question.

1849
02:20:15,620 --> 02:20:22,460
Ask Puppy, ask Dark Tetsuya about what the rest of the routine would have been if those

1850
02:20:22,460 --> 02:20:25,680
fuckers hadn't pulled him off stage.

1851
02:20:25,680 --> 02:20:29,500
Ask Xerox about how much he hates that name.

1852
02:20:29,500 --> 02:20:32,460
Or you can ask Jonas about what he's going to be doing at Power Station.

1853
02:20:32,460 --> 02:20:34,460
Way to go, way to go.

1854
02:20:34,460 --> 02:20:36,460
There's a lot of frustration all the way.

1855
02:20:36,460 --> 02:20:40,920

Ha!

1883
02:25:30,980 --> 02:25:59,980
All you men are randoms, and you're just that. Random. Bye.

1884
02:25:59,980 --> 02:26:00,980
Hi.

1885
02:26:00,980 --> 02:26:02,980
Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio, where...

1886
02:26:02,980 --> 02:26:04,980
What was orange?

1887
02:26:04,980 --> 02:26:06,980
Shaving monkeys is always permitted.

1888
02:26:06,980 --> 02:26:07,980
Just kidding.

1889
02:26:07,980 --> 02:26:08,980
But...

1890
02:26:08,980 --> 02:26:09,980
What is...

1891
02:26:09,980 --> 02:26:12,980
Can I get some fun until it poos on your face?

1892
02:26:12,980 --> 02:26:14,980
You scare the monkey, you don't come in.

1893
02:26:17,980 --> 02:26:19,980
No, no, no. I'll just bring Shermy.

1894
02:26:21,980 --> 02:26:23,980
If Shermy doesn't like you, leave.

1895
02:26:23,980 --> 02:26:27,980
Proceeding, as always, was brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.

1896
02:26:53,980 --> 02:26:55,980
p0k3smot42o 1 less person i have to take home bye

1897
02:27:23,980 --> 02:27:29,060
can ask her about something she saw there. You can ask Angel and Megas personal questions.

1898
02:27:29,060 --> 02:27:34,500
You can ask Joe about his routine. You can ask Loki about why he's such a bastard. You

1899
02:27:34,500 --> 02:27:41,500
can ask Zero about Xerox or whatever. You can ask Anita about being cute.

1900
02:27:45,940 --> 02:27:51,900
I'd like to comment on her quote yesterday in the chatroom. It rules. You can read that

1901
02:27:51,900 --> 02:27:58,620
off by the way the quote was bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity also

1902
02:27:58,620 --> 02:28:01,140
I want to say hello to Jonas let's talk to Jonas for a bit while people are

1903
02:28:01,140 --> 02:28:04,820
submitting questions give it a minute Jonas how you doing okay we didn't get

1904
02:28:04,820 --> 02:28:06,980
to talk to you about the tournament how did how did you feel about it

1905
02:28:06,980 --> 02:28:11,580
March Madness first of all first of all I thought this was like the best term

1906
02:28:11,580 --> 02:28:20,140
I've ever been everything was all set up right especially for PA though some

1907
02:28:20,140 --> 02:28:25,140
Some people were complaining about having a 10-footer as like, do you know what he said

1908
02:28:25,140 --> 02:28:26,140
in his song?

1909
02:28:26,140 --> 02:28:27,140
Yep.

1910
02:28:27,140 --> 02:28:31,140
I think some people were complaining about putting naked no 10-footers.

1911
02:28:31,140 --> 02:28:34,140
The score was like the easiest 10-footer of all time.

1912
02:28:34,140 --> 02:28:39,140
You know what's interesting though is that the way Mike seeded is he didn't seed it just

1913
02:28:39,140 --> 02:28:40,140
by score.

1914
02:28:40,140 --> 02:28:44,140
Some people that screwed up their combos on bag and stuff got seeded lower.

1915
02:28:44,140 --> 02:28:48,140
If they got more than like 50 grades, he threw them in the bottom saying, you know what,

1916
02:28:48,140 --> 02:28:50,140
know what, don't do that shit, which is pretty cool.

1917
02:29:18,140 --> 02:29:20,140
How the fuck am I the upset king if I keep winning?

1918
02:29:22,540 --> 02:29:26,200
No, I'm just kidding I don't have an ego like that I I honestly eat both times

1919
02:29:26,720 --> 02:29:29,220
Both times was a huge surprise. There's a huge surprise

1920
02:29:36,460 --> 02:29:40,760
Oh, yes, my alter ego dr. Dick I know who I am. I know who I am

1921
02:29:40,760 --> 02:29:43,700
Do you know why the video is going to embarrass my mother?

1922
02:29:43,700 --> 02:29:46,800
That's obviously the video of the actual freestyle routine is out

1923
02:29:46,800 --> 02:29:52,880
But don't waste your time downloading it it sucks wait for the whole thing wait for the official videos that are gonna

1924
02:29:52,880 --> 02:29:59,160
Have the whole thing the introduction and the follow-up because the routine itself sucks shit although as I found out

1925
02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:03,380
Just moments ago. I came in seventh place dr. D

1926
02:30:03,380 --> 02:30:08,520
I should say dr. Dick came in seventh place which means if one of the top six flakes

1927
02:30:09,080 --> 02:30:11,680
I'm going to power station, and I have to do a freestyle

1928
02:30:11,680 --> 02:30:16,680
But we'll find out what your song is somehow.

1929
02:30:16,680 --> 02:30:21,680
And of course you may not want to improv it because this is an actual power station.

1930
02:30:21,680 --> 02:30:26,680
Now this is interesting though, is because does Dr. Dick have to do it, or can I do it?

1931
02:30:26,680 --> 02:30:28,680
That's the other question, do I have to do it as Dr. Dick?

1932
02:30:28,680 --> 02:30:32,680
Well I could be a two-faced person and say half-sky.

1933
02:30:32,680 --> 02:30:37,680
I don't know, I'm going to have to think about that. That's going to be kind of hard to...

1934
02:30:37,680 --> 02:30:39,680
Okay, half spanky, half dick.

1935
02:31:07,680 --> 02:31:12,200
to give a shout out to their tournament. I'm sure they did a fabulous DDR Magic 5. I've

1936
02:31:12,200 --> 02:31:17,520
got some results. They had a tech category and I'm sure it was insane. First place, GPF

1937
02:31:17,520 --> 02:31:23,280
Lift, surprise. Second place, Dancing Jedi. He's like the Tigger up there. You know he

1938
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:27,360
wins the tournament. Oh, surprise. So that's why, ooh, if he comes to B3, which I hear

1939
02:31:27,360 --> 02:31:33,920
he is, it's going to be a great showdown. That's going to be beautiful. Oh, I'll wet

1940
02:31:33,920 --> 02:31:38,000
my pants all right third was unblinking eyes so congratulations top three in

1941
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:43,760
tech there Oni first place was dancing Jedi second place was GPF lift and third

1942
02:31:43,760 --> 02:31:47,480
place was cynic good job you guys challenge now this is cool I am

1943
02:31:47,480 --> 02:31:50,520
surprised that the challenge competition has never been ripped off here in nor

1944
02:31:50,520 --> 02:31:55,640
Caleb just wait maybe maybe we'll rip that off the next actor but they do like

1945
02:31:55,640 --> 02:31:58,440
if you remember challenge from fourth makes an extra mix they do a competition

1946
02:31:58,440 --> 02:32:02,680
that's all like about that like how many goods can you get on this song or how

1947
02:32:02,680 --> 02:32:06,420
How many perfects can you get not looking at it or whatever, like all this crazy stuff

1948
02:32:06,420 --> 02:32:07,420
they do?

1949
02:32:07,420 --> 02:32:08,540
Oh yeah.

1950
02:32:08,540 --> 02:32:11,380
And it's interesting, but this is interesting because the Seattle tournaments, they're all

1951
02:32:11,380 --> 02:32:15,620
PA, there's no freestyle, because I guess they can't freestyle or whatever, I don't

1952
02:32:15,620 --> 02:32:16,620
know.

1953
02:32:16,620 --> 02:32:17,620
You never know.

1954
02:32:17,620 --> 02:32:20,120
They're going to prove us wrong at B3, I bet you anything, they're going to all put their

1955
02:32:20,120 --> 02:32:23,280
heads together and just give this kick-ass freestyle, they'll just put everything else

1956
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:24,280
to shame.

1957
02:32:24,280 --> 02:32:29,080
You got people around the U.S. freestyling hella good, and they'll be from Omaha, they

1958
02:32:29,080 --> 02:32:33,080
from New York. Hell, it can happen.

1959
02:32:33,080 --> 02:32:36,080
First place in challenge was Krakoon.

1960
02:32:36,080 --> 02:32:37,080
Second place was Dancing Jedi.

1961
02:32:37,080 --> 02:32:39,080
And third place was Sinic.

1962
02:32:39,080 --> 02:32:40,080
Good job, you guys.

1963
02:32:40,080 --> 02:32:42,080
Alright, so that was the DDR Magic Tournament.

1964
02:32:42,080 --> 02:32:44,080
And I guess there was a tournament in Florida, and Tigger won a machine.

1965
02:32:44,080 --> 02:32:45,080
Yes, he did.

1966
02:32:45,080 --> 02:32:47,080
Nobody was paying attention to that tournament, so they don't give a shoutout.

1967
02:32:47,080 --> 02:32:49,080
I thought Tigger wasn't there.

1968
02:32:49,080 --> 02:32:53,080
If somebody can give me information on who plays in that tournament, I'll gladly read their names.

1969
02:32:53,080 --> 02:32:54,080
Okay, get to the Q&A!

1970
02:32:54,080 --> 02:32:56,080
Chat room's demanding we get to the Q&A.

1971
02:32:56,080 --> 02:32:58,080
Yes. Boost your questions, please.

1972
02:32:58,080 --> 02:33:00,080
We start with riceprincess.

1973
02:33:00,080 --> 02:33:05,080
Riceprincess wants to know what is DJ Taka's real name?

1974
02:33:05,080 --> 02:33:07,080
I don't know.

1975
02:33:07,080 --> 02:33:12,080
Actually, if you look in the DVR Max thing, his name is...

1976
02:33:12,080 --> 02:33:16,080
No, get the US DVR Max, it's in there.

1977
02:33:16,080 --> 02:33:21,080
She says she found out already, but we're challenging ourselves now.

1978
02:33:21,080 --> 02:33:26,080
Oh, riceprincess has it, but let's see if Loki can find it.

1979
02:33:26,080 --> 02:33:39,340
can find it now it's a game are we as smart as the chat room I have the

1980
02:33:39,340 --> 02:33:47,200
answer should I just Oh dark Tetsuya you know beautiful that's it that's what

1981
02:33:47,200 --> 02:33:53,720
rice princess has Takayuki Ishikawa beautiful angel says hi to rice princess

1982
02:33:53,720 --> 02:34:04,760
to by Joe thanks for coming

1983
02:34:05,760 --> 02:34:12,040
any final thoughts on your day all right thank you but I bet you didn't know that

1984
02:34:12,040 --> 02:34:18,100
that V was co-opted by DJ Taka and Antonio Vivaldi.

1985
02:34:18,100 --> 02:34:21,860
No, I kid you not, it's in the case notes.

1986
02:34:21,860 --> 02:34:23,940
Seeing as you know, Vivaldi is the classic piece

1987
02:34:23,940 --> 02:34:27,340
that is based off of.

1988
02:34:27,340 --> 02:34:29,980
Vivaldi's Winter?

1989
02:34:29,980 --> 02:34:30,480
Hello.

1990
02:34:35,220 --> 02:34:37,380
All right, all right, all right, here we go.

1991
02:34:37,380 --> 02:34:44,380
I slept with Mr. Brian once. Okay, here we go. Shh.

1992
02:34:44,380 --> 02:34:51,380
RicePrincess says, what is that white slab in my can of beans?

1993
02:34:51,380 --> 02:34:57,380
Pork. Pork. Fat.

1994
02:34:57,380 --> 02:35:02,380
The other white guy. The other white guy. I'm sorry, Zero?

1995
02:35:02,380 --> 02:35:08,380
It was the other guy who played, it was the other white guy who played Let the Beat Hit.

1996
02:35:08,380 --> 02:35:10,380
Sigh.

1997
02:35:10,380 --> 02:35:14,380
Okay. And she's warning us to look forward to Orange Crush in the future.

1998
02:35:14,380 --> 02:35:16,380
She's got some questions.

1999
02:35:16,380 --> 02:35:20,380
Vidpowah! Oh, Vidpowah's question was for DarkTetsuya and he left! Shit!

2000
02:35:20,380 --> 02:35:21,380
I'll answer it!

2001
02:35:21,380 --> 02:35:25,380
Okay, well this was it. It was DarkTetsuya, it was, this was a question from Vidpowah.

2002
02:35:25,380 --> 02:35:28,380
Why are you so awesome and why do you rule so much?

2003
02:35:28,380 --> 02:35:31,380
That's the question!

2004
02:35:31,380 --> 02:35:33,380
Yeah, it's rhetorical.

2005
02:35:33,380 --> 02:35:35,380
He just does.

2006
02:35:35,380 --> 02:35:37,380
Because he's influenced by Dark Sakura.

2007
02:35:37,380 --> 02:35:39,380
Yes, because we're his friends.

2008
02:35:39,380 --> 02:35:41,380
That's why he rules so much. That's the answer.

2009
02:35:41,380 --> 02:35:43,380
He rules so much because we're his friends.

2010
02:35:43,380 --> 02:35:45,380
Alright.

2011
02:35:45,380 --> 02:35:47,380
Snubdismoid says,

2012
02:35:47,380 --> 02:35:53,380
Why, in the name of God, did I have to get two greats on Never Let You Down?

2013
02:35:53,380 --> 02:35:55,380
Because you suck.

2014
02:35:55,380 --> 02:35:57,380
I'm kidding.

2015
02:35:57,380 --> 02:36:03,500
Uh, you got two greats, I'll never let you down because you weren't concentrating, and

2016
02:36:03,500 --> 02:36:05,300
next time your neck gets blown off.

2017
02:36:05,300 --> 02:36:08,940
Because you have to pee, and you can't PA when you have to pee.

2018
02:36:08,940 --> 02:36:15,500
Alright, Snubdicenoid also wants to say to Angel, did you get to ride the, and pardon

2019
02:36:15,500 --> 02:36:20,620
my white pronunciation of this, Shinca, woo, and I burped too, Shincansen, the bullet train,

2020
02:36:20,620 --> 02:36:21,620
did you get to ride the bullet train?

2021
02:36:21,620 --> 02:36:27,260
No, but my father and my friend did, on the way over to where we were.

2022
02:36:27,260 --> 02:36:30,260
That's cool. Did you get to see it? Did you get to hear him honk the horn?

2023
02:36:30,260 --> 02:36:41,260
Uh, no. We have little trains over there. They got to see, like, Hiroshima and, you know, uh, Mount Fuji, you know, all the little sites while they're going down, so...

2024
02:36:41,260 --> 02:36:42,260
Alright.

2025
02:36:42,260 --> 02:36:47,260
Except it took them, like, ten hours to get to where we were, so, yeah.

2026
02:36:47,260 --> 02:36:55,260
Alright. Oh, and Snubdissonoid says, you know what? Hey, Jamie, you know what? Snubdissonoid, he did have to pee. Amazing.

2027
02:36:55,260 --> 02:37:01,860
miss Cleo live in the house all right Justin would like to say how many people

2028
02:37:01,860 --> 02:37:05,020

02:37:05,020 --> 02:37:09,900

2032
02:37:22,220 --> 02:37:24,220
You've seen Ren and Stimpy?

2033
02:37:24,220 --> 02:37:26,220
Of course!

2034
02:37:26,220 --> 02:37:28,220
There must have been a reference I missed.

2035
02:37:28,220 --> 02:37:30,220
It's all about the brand new episodes on TNN.

2036
02:37:30,220 --> 02:37:32,220
It's all about the brand new episodes on TNN.

2037
02:37:32,220 --> 02:37:36,220
Yes, that's right, they bought the rights for it and they're making new episodes.

2038
02:37:36,220 --> 02:37:38,220
This is amazing.

2039
02:37:38,220 --> 02:37:42,220
For the first time in my life, I watched SpongeBob SquarePants.

2040
02:37:42,220 --> 02:37:44,220
Never seen it, never will.

2041
02:37:44,220 --> 02:37:46,220
It's pretty fucking funny. I think you're missing out.

2042
02:37:46,220 --> 02:37:48,220
It's pretty funny. I was impressed.

2043
02:37:48,220 --> 02:37:50,220
Eat me.

2044
02:37:50,220 --> 02:37:53,220
You have got me watching Invader Zim now.

2045
02:37:53,220 --> 02:37:54,220
Oh.

2046
02:37:54,220 --> 02:37:56,220
Well, I've been downloading them.

2047
02:37:56,220 --> 02:38:03,220
RicePrincess says the correct answer to the bean question was,

2048
02:38:03,220 --> 02:38:06,220
it's the queen bean and the rest are worker beans.

2049
02:38:06,220 --> 02:38:08,220
I remember that.

2050
02:38:08,220 --> 02:38:11,220
Okay, that's it. I'm curious.

2051
02:38:11,220 --> 02:38:16,220
Questions for the two of us, please.

2052
02:38:16,220 --> 02:38:17,220
Oh, I'm sorry, what?

2053
02:38:17,220 --> 02:38:18,220
I don't know.

2054
02:38:18,220 --> 02:38:19,220
Next question?

2055
02:38:19,220 --> 02:38:23,220
I'm curious about what they would like to ask us if they want to ask us.

2056
02:38:23,220 --> 02:38:25,220
Well, here we go. I'm moving on. I'm moving on with more questions.

2057
02:38:25,220 --> 02:38:26,220
Cool.

2058
02:38:26,220 --> 02:38:29,220
Yo, SFBB, do you carry a pen with you everywhere?

2059
02:38:29,220 --> 02:38:30,220
No.

2060
02:38:30,220 --> 02:38:31,220
No, I don't.

2061
02:38:31,220 --> 02:38:32,220
I do.

2062
02:38:32,220 --> 02:38:35,220
I don't need to. I always borrow my pen from Jamie.

2063
02:38:35,220 --> 02:38:37,220
My pen is also a glow stick.

2064
02:38:37,220 --> 02:38:39,220
Oh, dear.

2065
02:38:39,220 --> 02:38:42,220
I carry the penis, my dear.

2066
02:38:42,220 --> 02:38:45,220
Because the penis, my dear.

2067
02:38:45,220 --> 02:38:58,460
I like to be the first on the show to say that I outright boycott any more Battle Royale

2068
02:38:58,460 --> 02:39:02,580
references in the show.

2069
02:39:02,580 --> 02:39:08,900
It was funny, no it wasn't even funny the first time, I let it slide because it was

2070
02:39:08,900 --> 02:39:09,900
kind of cute.

2071
02:39:09,900 --> 02:39:15,020
Second time was slightly less cute but still cute nonetheless, kind of funny, a few different

2072
02:39:15,020 --> 02:39:19,580
references are cute. It's done. You killed the joke.

2073
02:39:19,580 --> 02:39:23,580
If you have any questions about Battle Royale, ask the dictionaries. Jamie and I.

2074
02:39:23,580 --> 02:39:30,100
VidPowah. Second question from VidPowah. I'm so confused. What exactly is this Bimani Battle

2075
02:39:30,100 --> 02:39:33,140
Royale that you keep talking about?

2076
02:39:33,140 --> 02:39:39,900
Battle Royale is a movie. Go to battleroyalonline.com and it's the best movie ever.

2077
02:39:39,900 --> 02:39:43,140
And imagine a bunch of us just flipping around the livery room throwing paper plates at each

2078
02:39:43,140 --> 02:39:46,240
each other, stabbing each other with candles in the eye.

2079
02:39:46,240 --> 02:39:47,440
Sorry, I didn't hit you in the eye.

2080
02:39:47,440 --> 02:39:50,440
I can break this down very easily.

2081
02:39:50,440 --> 02:39:52,440
What happens when a bunch of six-year-olds

2082
02:39:52,440 --> 02:39:53,680
watch the Power Rangers?

2083
02:39:53,680 --> 02:39:54,780
What happens after that?

2084
02:39:54,780 --> 02:39:56,700
They all pretend that they are Power Rangers.

2085
02:39:56,700 --> 02:39:59,120
And they pretend, you know, I'm the red one, I'm the pink one.

2086
02:39:59,120 --> 02:40:00,700
And they beat each other up, you know, pretend.

2087
02:40:00,700 --> 02:40:02,620
And then they pretend that they're transforming

2088
02:40:02,620 --> 02:40:04,620
and stuff like that.

2089
02:40:04,620 --> 02:40:05,660
Shut up, Dave.

2090
02:40:05,660 --> 02:40:07,380
Anyway, that's what happened.

2091
02:40:07,380 --> 02:40:08,500
We watched Battle Royale.

2092
02:40:08,500 --> 02:40:10,040
And then suddenly a bunch of six-year-olds

2093
02:40:10,040 --> 02:40:12,340
were running around my living room playing Battle Royale,

2094
02:40:12,340 --> 02:40:18,420
cutting each other with paper plates, strangling each other with tape. It was beautiful. And

2095
02:40:18,420 --> 02:40:19,820
that was the Bomani Battle Royale.

2096
02:40:19,820 --> 02:40:26,220
And that's when I got knee-dropped into Rob's coffee table by zero.

2097
02:40:26,220 --> 02:40:27,220
Nothing will uh...

2098
02:40:27,220 --> 02:40:30,820
Actually I pushed her and she just kind of fell, but I didn't knee-drop her, she knee-dropped

2099
02:40:30,820 --> 02:40:31,820
herself.

2100
02:40:31,820 --> 02:40:38,500
I think the greatest fuck-up all day was Loki doing a caution drop on Max, too.

2101
02:40:38,500 --> 02:40:42,760
one that wasn't a caution drop in number two I had actually put the freeze there

2102
02:40:42,760 --> 02:40:47,040
for that purpose but the problem is is pulling the freeze in the back of your

2103
02:40:47,040 --> 02:40:50,920
hands when you do like a drop like that you can't hold it down so there's not

2104
02:40:50,920 --> 02:40:54,920
enough weight you can't get your like torso up high enough so that all your

2105
02:40:54,920 --> 02:41:00,320
weights on your hands I should have that knee drop but yeah I couldn't get back

2106
02:41:00,320 --> 02:41:05,320
up because I'm fat I want to see someone hold two freeze arrows on the diagonals

2107
02:41:05,320 --> 02:41:10,000
with each of their asscheeks. Just have like one on the left and one on the right and be

2108
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:24,000
able to hold it. As Rob looks at me and his eyebrow twitches. Alright, let's move on.

2109
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:30,320
Snubdistanoid says, Does anyone in the studio have a Gameboy Advance SP? I got one and safe

2110
02:41:30,320 --> 02:41:35,080
to say, it rocks my cocks. First of all, those things hurt my hand, and I have an afterburner

2111
02:41:35,080 --> 02:41:41,080
in my GBA, so I own you. Uh, I want an afterburner in my GBA, I don't need a Gameboy SP if I

2112
02:41:41,080 --> 02:41:54,080
get an afterburner. Does anybody have one? Nope. Question, he has more than one? I read

2113
02:41:54,080 --> 02:42:01,080
bit wrong, but cock doesn't rhyme with rocks. So I had to say cocks, it's just natural.

2114
02:42:01,080 --> 02:42:06,080
Okay, uh, one of our chatroom frequenters, if you ever run into him, his name is BigRedPimp.

2115
02:42:06,080 --> 02:42:12,080
Um, he does have an SP, so if you want, like, you know, info on it, just ask him.

2116
02:42:12,080 --> 02:42:16,080
No, see? See, wait, wait, hold on. Let me just say it. Court.

2117
02:42:16,080 --> 02:42:19,080
There's a person in here whose fiance works for GameStop, hello.

2118
02:42:19,080 --> 02:42:21,080
No, okay.

2119
02:42:21,080 --> 02:42:23,080
I'm bad Jamie. I'm bad Jamie.

2120
02:42:23,080 --> 02:42:25,080
I'm bad Jamie.

2121
02:42:25,080 --> 02:42:27,080
Hold on, let me speak. Zero.

2122
02:42:27,080 --> 02:42:29,080
Go ahead.

2123
02:42:29,080 --> 02:42:34,080
Let me just say that Corey probably bought one, and he probably got two others just from getting them.

2124
02:42:34,080 --> 02:42:41,080
Okay, the SP is like the worst idea ever. I mean, it's cool that it's compact, but it does hurt your hands.

2125
02:42:41,080 --> 02:42:45,080
And if you have big hands, that's just gonna hurt you too.

2126
02:42:45,080 --> 02:42:50,080
And it just looks kinda cool, but stupid at the same time.

2127
02:42:50,080 --> 02:42:54,800
shoulder buttons are the most retarded I know they're like in the crease of the

2128
02:42:54,800 --> 02:42:59,320
screen it's a that's going on my video game review oh yeah but check it out I

2129
02:42:59,320 --> 02:43:09,000
know how small the GBA is GBA SP but look you can play with one hand like

2130
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:13,240
squeezing a book you look like you're squeezing a boob

2131
02:43:13,240 --> 02:43:18,240
Or rocking your own cocks.

2132
02:43:18,240 --> 02:43:23,240
I am good at it.

2133
02:43:23,240 --> 02:43:28,240
The only game that does not work on SP is Kirby's Tilt and Tumble.

2134
02:43:28,240 --> 02:43:33,240
Because you have to rock the Game Boy.

2135
02:43:33,240 --> 02:43:38,240
And of course, up equals down, left equals right if you play the game.

2136
02:43:38,240 --> 02:43:50,240
just do yourself a favor, get a used GBA and get an afterburner

2137
02:43:50,240 --> 02:43:58,240
these people that are buying these SPs are the same people that bought the Gameboy, then the Gameboy Pocket, then the Gameboy Color, then the Gameboy Advance, then all the SPs

2138
02:43:58,240 --> 02:44:02,240
you stupid bastards, do you realize they just milked five systems out of you?

2139
02:44:02,240 --> 02:44:08,720
Haha, I laugh at you ass. I've only bought the Gameboy and now I'm going to buy the SP

2140
02:44:09,880 --> 02:44:13,060
SP customers are the ones who bought virtual boys and enjoyed them

2141
02:44:13,060 --> 02:44:16,260
I bought a virtual boy and enjoyed it and I don't have an SP

2142
02:44:16,880 --> 02:44:21,180
We got a virtual boy when Hollywood was clearing them out. So we have like the nice plastic case

2143
02:44:22,800 --> 02:44:27,480
No, actually to be perfectly honest when the game when the Gameboy Pocket came out

2144
02:44:27,520 --> 02:44:31,000
It was a massive improvement over the regular Gameboy because it was clearer

2145
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:37,000
But I love my Game Boy Color, and I still use it for one thing, DDRTV2.

2146
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:38,000
Oh yeah.

2147
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:43,000
No, the ones who bought SPs are probably the same ones who bought game comms.

2148
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
Anyway.

2149
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
Okay, I got a game comm for five bucks.

2150
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
When Toys R Us is carrying them out.

2151
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:50,000
Moving on.

2152
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
I own 42 video games, just console.

2153
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:55,000
Hello.

2154
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:56,000
Okay.

2155
02:44:58,000 --> 02:44:59,000
Justin.

2156
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:03,520
Justin circuit is asking us a bunch of questions here

2157
02:45:03,520 --> 02:45:06,920

2159
02:45:12,120 --> 02:45:12,480

2160
02:45:12,480 --> 02:45:19,480

2166
02:46:11,560 --> 02:46:12,860

2167
02:46:12,860 --> 02:46:17,280
a special question for angel

2168
02:46:17,280 --> 02:46:20,520

shadow i hate you no no no ok ask the question do you mind if jen and i come visit for a while

2170
02:46:26,520 --> 02:46:33,060

2171
02:46:33,060 --> 02:46:35,360
and what kinds of things will be on the agenda of

2172
02:46:35,360 --> 02:46:39,020
hmm

2173
02:46:39,020 --> 02:46:41,040
ok

2174
02:46:41,040 --> 02:46:45,960
I am now going to end the fucking music. Oh, I missed... Justin, I missed your last line,

2175
02:46:45,960 --> 02:46:49,120
whatever the last thing is you sent. You asked another question, I accidentally asked that

2176
02:46:49,120 --> 02:46:54,320
and you need to resend it. Okay. Since we're out of questions, does anybody in the room

2177
02:46:54,320 --> 02:47:00,320
have a question for somebody else? Yes. Yes, Dave. I have a question for Rob. Great. Have

2178
02:47:00,320 --> 02:47:05,480
you ever AAA'd a heavy song? Have I ever AAA'd a heavy song? Just this week, I AAA'd La Copa

2179
02:47:05,480 --> 02:47:11,160
Davido, which is my first AAA Heavy on Extreme, I should say, because I did a few on 4th Mix

2180
02:47:11,160 --> 02:47:12,160
back then.

2181
02:47:12,160 --> 02:47:13,160
Oh really?

2182
02:47:13,160 --> 02:47:14,160
Oh, that's cool.

2183
02:47:14,160 --> 02:47:15,160
I have, on the 4th Mix, Superstar.

2184
02:47:15,160 --> 02:47:16,160
Awesome.

2185
02:47:16,160 --> 02:47:21,480
That was like when I played Superstar every game I ever played.

2186
02:47:21,480 --> 02:47:22,480
I remember.

2187
02:47:22,480 --> 02:47:23,480
I have a question.

2188
02:47:23,480 --> 02:47:26,800
Tarim, which of us do you think would win a battle royale?

2189
02:47:26,800 --> 02:47:27,800
Dave.

2190
02:47:27,800 --> 02:47:28,800
Dave.

2191
02:47:28,800 --> 02:47:29,800
Dave.

2192
02:47:29,800 --> 02:47:30,800
Okay, wait.

2193
02:47:30,800 --> 02:47:31,800
Okay.

2194
02:47:31,800 --> 02:47:32,800
I actually have...

2195
02:47:32,800 --> 02:47:33,800
Okay.

2196
02:47:33,800 --> 02:47:37,240
I actually got a bunch of questions just now, so I'm going to go through those.

2197
02:47:37,240 --> 02:47:38,240
Anita.

2198
02:47:38,240 --> 02:47:39,240
Oh, yeah.

2199
02:47:39,240 --> 02:47:40,240
Okay, hold on.

2200
02:47:40,240 --> 02:47:41,240
Let's let Anita ask her question.

2201
02:47:41,240 --> 02:47:42,240
I want to check it out.

2202
02:47:42,240 --> 02:47:43,240
It's not so much a question.

2203
02:47:43,240 --> 02:47:48,800
I have an accomplishment I wanted to announce.

2204
02:47:48,800 --> 02:47:52,800
I passed my first 2DX song with a full combo.

2205
02:47:52,800 --> 02:47:53,800
Yay!

2206
02:47:53,800 --> 02:47:54,800
It was a...

2207
02:47:54,800 --> 02:47:55,800
What is it?

2208
02:47:55,800 --> 02:47:56,800
Beauty of Silence.

2209
02:47:56,800 --> 02:47:57,800
No, wait.

2210
02:47:57,800 --> 02:48:03,400
I forget what song it was. It was, it was, no, it was Beauty of Silence or...

2211
02:48:03,400 --> 02:48:06,440
I think it was, oh, I can't remember. I'll remember it.

2212
02:48:06,440 --> 02:48:09,680
But it was, it was Full Combo. Yay! I have one too!

2213
02:48:09,680 --> 02:48:12,840
I passed three other 2DX songs today.

2214
02:48:12,840 --> 02:48:16,800
Yay! Gotta start somewhere. Full Combo too!

2215
02:48:16,800 --> 02:48:20,960
Chat Room says, Dave, because he's insane, just look at him for the battle royale.

2216
02:48:20,960 --> 02:48:24,960
I think I'd kick his ass. Alright.

2217
02:48:24,960 --> 02:48:29,520
Shadow would like to clarify, Shadow would like to clarify, I haven't a clue but you're

2218
02:48:29,520 --> 02:48:30,520
not around.

2219
02:48:30,520 --> 02:48:38,840
Alright, Snub would like to say, on sackbamani.com who is deleted member and what happened?

2220
02:48:38,840 --> 02:48:40,480
Oh god, you had to bring this up.

2221
02:48:40,480 --> 02:48:44,600
Okay, our hosts suck a big ball of shit.

2222
02:48:44,600 --> 02:48:49,340
What happened is that some of our files started getting either deleted or zeroed out, which

2223
02:48:49,340 --> 02:48:51,660
means all the content in them was deleted.

2224
02:48:51,660 --> 02:48:56,860
So threads are gone, members are gone, there's no rational explanation for it, it's just

2225
02:48:56,860 --> 02:49:00,100
their servers deciding to fuck with our files.

2226
02:49:00,100 --> 02:49:01,100
What?

2227
02:49:01,100 --> 02:49:03,980
You know I thought it was a quota thing but it's not because it's still letting me upload

2228
02:49:03,980 --> 02:49:04,980
new files.

2229
02:49:04,980 --> 02:49:08,340
It's the wild monkey they have controlling the server there.

2230
02:49:08,340 --> 02:49:09,340
Delete.

2231
02:49:09,340 --> 02:49:10,340
Delete.

2232
02:49:10,340 --> 02:49:11,340
Delete.

2233
02:49:11,340 --> 02:49:12,340
Delete.

2234
02:49:12,340 --> 02:49:13,340
Delete.

2235
02:49:13,340 --> 02:49:16,500
Don't ever use onedollarhosting.com, they suck big balls.

2236
02:49:16,500 --> 02:49:20,060
But the press said yes!

2237
02:49:20,060 --> 02:49:21,860
Moving on.

2238
02:49:21,860 --> 02:49:28,180
We're working on a backup plan as we speak.

2239
02:49:28,180 --> 02:49:29,620
I'm going to make forums.

2240
02:49:29,620 --> 02:49:32,420
I don't know how, but I will.

2241
02:49:32,420 --> 02:49:34,260
Another show of hands for Justin, please.

2242
02:49:34,260 --> 02:49:35,260
Another show of hands.

2243
02:49:35,260 --> 02:49:36,260
Here we go.

2244
02:49:36,260 --> 02:49:38,300
How many people like Cup of Child?

2245
02:49:38,300 --> 02:49:40,300
Cup of Child, anybody?

2246
02:49:40,300 --> 02:49:41,300
Three?

2247
02:49:41,300 --> 02:49:42,300
Four.

2248
02:49:42,300 --> 02:49:43,300
Okay, four.

2249
02:49:43,300 --> 02:49:44,300
Okay.

2250
02:49:44,300 --> 02:49:51,300
Okay. Last question, gang. Last question. This is a good one. We can go around the room

2251
02:49:54,100 --> 02:49:57,980
and ask everyone this. This one comes from Vidpowah. And Vidpowah would like to know

2252
02:49:57,980 --> 02:50:02,100
from everybody, and everybody's experienced enough with this game now, what is your favorite

2253
02:50:02,100 --> 02:50:09,100
2DX video? Let's go around. Let's go around. Starting with Jamie, or you want to go last?

2254
02:50:09,100 --> 02:50:13,100
What else? Stoic.

2255
02:50:13,100 --> 02:50:21,100
I was gonna say the same thing, stoic.

2256
02:50:21,100 --> 02:50:38,100
Okay, um, wow wow 70s because where else does like broccoli have an afro along with skyscrapers and all this other cool stuff that sends out afro rays and triple A's the world with afros. It's just cool.

2257
02:50:38,100 --> 02:50:43,100
Go afro.

2258
02:50:43,100 --> 02:50:45,100
Um...

2259
02:50:45,100 --> 02:50:50,100
I'll have to say, I like Bad Routine, that's pretty good.

2260
02:50:50,100 --> 02:50:55,100
Yeah, Bad Routine is a guy dancing, or Dancer's pretty good.

2261
02:50:55,100 --> 02:51:00,100
But, if you want to go with iCandy, you can't be Last Message, because there's giant breasts.

2262
02:51:00,100 --> 02:51:02,100
Oh yeah.

2263
02:51:02,100 --> 02:51:04,100
Rob Lick Boots today.

2264
02:51:04,100 --> 02:51:20,100
I would probably say my favorite one is, and people will laugh at me about this, but the Calcutta video, because Dr. Bombay is my hero and he owns you and second best is SOS, but if you get SOS you have to get the full video on Kazal.

2265
02:51:20,100 --> 02:51:30,100
This is probably really generic and everybody's favorite, but I have to say Alien World because it's got the cool little alien puppet doll thingies.

2266
02:51:30,100 --> 02:51:37,100
Alien World gave me nightmares the first time I saw it. I had a dream of weird alien people coming to kill me. I'm done.

2267
02:51:37,100 --> 02:51:45,100
Alright, Angel made a decision, finally. I chose B because, well, yeah, it turns out that one too.

2268
02:51:45,100 --> 02:51:47,100
I can't believe I didn't think about this.

2269
02:51:47,100 --> 02:51:51,100
The best one has to be, uh, one of the best ones has to be, uh, Gradius Cyber.

2270
02:51:51,100 --> 02:51:53,100
Yeah, Gradius Cyber.

2271
02:51:53,100 --> 02:51:57,100
I was like, I thought I was changing my mind. I was thinking about using, thinking about slag work.

2272
02:51:57,100 --> 02:51:59,100
Mmm. Burning Heat?

2273
02:51:59,100 --> 02:52:03,100
For me, I have a couple. One of them is definitely a Sweet Lab.

2274
02:52:03,100 --> 02:52:05,100
Because it's so cute.

2275
02:52:05,100 --> 02:52:12,100
But my overall favorite one, actually I really like Burning Heat because it's also Gradius 2, which is one of my favorite shooter games ever.

2276
02:52:12,100 --> 02:52:17,100
I love the little thingies walking around with the little sign that says,

2277
02:52:17,100 --> 02:52:18,100
WIN!

2278
02:52:18,100 --> 02:52:19,100
The beeps!

2279
02:52:19,100 --> 02:52:21,100
Jelly kiss.

2280
02:52:21,100 --> 02:52:22,100
Whatever.

2281
02:52:22,100 --> 02:52:27,100
My favorite, I have a serious favorite and a fun favorite.

2282
02:52:27,100 --> 02:52:29,100
Well, I have a couple serious favorites.

2283
02:52:29,100 --> 02:52:30,100
Okay, then my overall.

2284
02:52:30,100 --> 02:52:31,100
Okay, my favorite videos.

2285
02:52:31,100 --> 02:52:32,100
Reincarnation.

2286
02:52:32,100 --> 02:52:33,100
Yes.

2287
02:52:33,100 --> 02:52:34,100
Good, good, good.

2288
02:52:34,100 --> 02:52:35,100
Dancer.

2289
02:52:35,100 --> 02:52:36,100
Good, good, good.

2290
02:52:36,100 --> 02:52:40,100
And then my favorite 2DX video of all time, and a lot of people forget about this one,

2291
02:52:40,100 --> 02:52:43,880
this one, but it honestly is the most kick-ass 2DX video they ever did, because they cut

2292
02:52:43,880 --> 02:52:48,880
it after a couple styles were set. Sometime. Sometime is the best 2DX video.

2293
02:52:48,880 --> 02:52:51,880
No, Route 80s. Route 80s is, like, the best one ever.

2294
02:52:51,880 --> 02:52:56,160
You know, the best one is Nothing Ain't Stopping Us.

2295
02:52:56,160 --> 02:52:59,600
Funky Bingo Paradise. Because you can't beat the boogie dancers.

2296
02:52:59,600 --> 02:53:04,800
It's freakin' Funky Bingo Paradise. Wait, wait, wait. I gotta add another one,

2297
02:53:04,800 --> 02:53:09,080
just because it's all about us. It's all about Love Is Orange.

2298
02:53:09,080 --> 02:53:10,780
was orange

2299
02:53:10,780 --> 02:53:13,380

02:53:33,920 --> 02:53:37,040
fuck outta here right it's nine thirty hits so

2308
02:53:37,040 --> 02:53:39,440
Let's go around and get final thoughts.

2309
02:53:39,440 --> 02:53:40,760
You want to go around the room again?

2310
02:53:40,760 --> 02:53:42,600
Start with Magus.

2311
02:53:42,600 --> 02:53:44,000
All right, start with Magus.

2312
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:45,240
Final thought, please.

2313
02:53:45,240 --> 02:53:47,800
And whee!

2314
02:53:47,800 --> 02:53:48,320
Angel.

2315
02:53:48,320 --> 02:53:52,240
I'll grab the mic later.

2316
02:53:52,240 --> 02:53:53,440
I'll grab the mic later.

2317
02:53:53,440 --> 02:53:55,880
All right, Dave.

2318
02:53:55,880 --> 02:53:57,000
Xenon sucks.

2319
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:58,640
I'm not a tool.

2320
02:53:58,640 --> 02:54:05,680
And I will hopefully be able to go to B3 and do awesome.

2321
02:54:05,680 --> 02:54:34,680
New CBS update for Step Manias, came out on the 27th, that's pretty good, then there's also my site, since my site right now is up, and has all the DDR extreme and everything, pretty much every single official sim file out there I have, and DDR UK is down right now, and single width Bemani cell is down, so my server is the only place you can get them, too bad I haven't updated my pages to tell you how to get it.

2322
02:54:34,680 --> 02:54:36,680
My page is the hell you had to get it.

2323
02:55:04,680 --> 02:55:10,680
Also, I may suck at freestyling, but how far did the judges get in PA?

2324
02:55:10,680 --> 02:55:21,680
Also, next week I will have a video game review prepared with the help of Darkchild, who will also be helping me out with that. I'm done.

2325
02:55:21,680 --> 02:55:33,120
This is the girl that has no voice.

2326
02:55:33,120 --> 02:55:37,160
I don't know what to say except Ra Moon is the best drink in the world and that's about

2327
02:55:37,160 --> 02:55:38,160
it.

2328
02:55:38,160 --> 02:55:39,160
Yay!

2329
02:55:39,160 --> 02:55:40,160
Everybody have fun.

2330
02:55:40,160 --> 02:55:41,160
Hi to all my friends out there.

2331
02:55:41,160 --> 02:55:42,160
Everybody.

2332
02:55:42,160 --> 02:55:43,160
What?

2333
02:55:43,160 --> 02:55:46,320
I guess I have no friends.

2334
02:55:46,320 --> 02:55:47,320
Shereequah.

2335
02:55:47,320 --> 02:55:48,320
Okay.

2336
02:55:48,320 --> 02:55:49,320
I'm done.

2337
02:55:49,320 --> 02:55:50,840
I'm done.

2338
02:55:50,840 --> 02:55:53,160
Random quote, random quote.

2339
02:55:53,160 --> 02:55:56,080
Dude, what was that shirt that had Sinead, Martin?

2340
02:55:56,080 --> 02:55:57,600
It had Sinead in it.

2341
02:56:00,600 --> 02:56:02,120
Angel, your final thought?

2342
02:56:02,120 --> 02:56:05,840
Topo is white and squishy, but I don't know if Magus is white.

2343
02:56:05,840 --> 02:56:08,800
Magus is white, but I don't know if he's squishy.

2344
02:56:08,800 --> 02:56:09,300
Blink.

2345
02:56:09,300 --> 02:56:10,360
You don't need to know this.

2346
02:56:10,360 --> 02:56:11,320
Blink, blink.

2347
02:56:11,320 --> 02:56:12,600
Look at the quote from the chat room.

2348
02:56:12,600 --> 02:56:13,280
Check the top.

2349
02:56:13,280 --> 02:56:14,240
Jonas.

2350
02:56:14,240 --> 02:56:15,240
I know, final thoughts.

2351
02:56:15,240 --> 02:56:18,000
I'll be making a one, I'll be making a D-Direct file that's

2352
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:21,000
I'm gonna be in the next tournament whenever it comes out.

2353
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:25,000
Oh well.

2354
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:37,000
And, you're a freak that needs to stop having those blood viruses that, you know, cause you know, cause you know, you know the sacri- the sacri-

2355
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
I'm a Sacramento marshman that's on thread.

2356
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:43,000
Sometimes the spaces get, um, are off.

2357
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:48,000
And I know I'm two hours late, but F you to really bad April Fools pranks.

2358
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:53,000
There's a lot of people that tried stupid pranks and you can see right through them and we call them on it and we ruin their fun.

2359
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:58,000
Okay, I don't know how so many people fell for mine.

2360
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:03,000
I said I was moving to Seattle.

2361
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:08,000
There's some things you don't joke about. Because there's some things you just don't joke about.

2362
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:15,000
p0k3smot42o I've never heard an implementable joke that I was able to pull off

2363
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:25,000
My final thought is, um, uh, why don't you give me a sign?

2364
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
Never mind. Angel?

2365
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:28,000
I didn't have my final thought.

2366
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:29,000
Oh, Jamie?

2367
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:37,000
My final thought is, I want ice cream.

2368
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
The system is down.

2369
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000
Suck me one of your rules and I want to do this again.

2370
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:42,000
And again.

2371
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:44,000
Okay, I'll shut up.

2372
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:46,000
Seriously, I want ice cream.

2373
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:49,000
For my birthday, give me the Battle Royale novel.

2374
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,000
April 19th.

2375
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
No, I won't tell you how old I will be.

2376
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,000
You get the very final word, Jamie. What is it?

2377
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:56,000
I guess.

2378
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:57,000
Die!

2379
02:57:57,000 --> 02:58:01,000

Flair, beyond, and old, spy-duck

2392
02:59:13,520 --> 02:59:15,520
Voice, searching, or tell the glue

2393
02:59:15,520 --> 02:59:18,520
And a corpse of blue jackals and charmelians

2394
02:59:18,520 --> 02:59:20,520
Everybody pull drum on!

2395
02:59:36,520 --> 02:59:38,520
It's time to pull drum

2396
02:59:38,520 --> 02:59:41,520
For Ponyta and Pidgey too

2397
02:59:41,520 --> 02:59:44,520
Come on, put on your liter hose

2398
02:59:44,520 --> 02:59:51,520
Let's try not to stamp a little because you better grab yourself a partner

2399
02:59:51,520 --> 02:59:54,520
Like an accrual or Bulbasaur

2400
02:59:54,520 --> 02:59:57,520
Hold on a minute

2401
02:59:57,520 --> 03:00:00,520
There's still at least a hundred and twenty-seven more

2402
03:00:00,520 --> 03:00:02,520
Including Ladybot and all the stars

2403
