1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:02,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Message for you, sir.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,030
[SPEAKER_13]: Attention!

3
00:00:05,011 --> 00:00:08,872
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

4
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:15,554
[SPEAKER_21]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

5
00:00:19,188 --> 00:00:22,109
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

6
00:00:22,429 --> 00:00:25,610
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,891
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

8
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:32,332
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

9
00:00:33,132 --> 00:00:33,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

10
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

11
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:42,996
[SPEAKER_24]: In this episode... Hey, are there any balls down there?

12
00:00:43,256 --> 00:00:45,716
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the biggest berry you've ever seen, Jingleberry.

13
00:00:45,816 --> 00:00:47,437
[SPEAKER_13]: What's your favorite scary?

14
00:00:48,971 --> 00:00:49,572
[SPEAKER_23]: Showgirls.

15
00:00:50,452 --> 00:00:51,333
[SPEAKER_23]: Absolute fright.

16
00:00:51,873 --> 00:00:52,654
[SPEAKER_23]: What's yours?

17
00:00:52,694 --> 00:00:55,155
[SPEAKER_23]: There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

18
00:00:55,215 --> 00:00:56,536
[SPEAKER_23]: Don't torture yourself.

19
00:00:57,137 --> 00:00:57,937
[SPEAKER_23]: That's my job.

20
00:00:58,077 --> 00:00:59,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Now's the time our sprockets bend me dogs!

21
00:01:00,779 --> 00:01:04,542
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too.

22
00:01:04,942 --> 00:01:05,863
[SPEAKER_10]: I know Kung Fu.

23
00:01:06,223 --> 00:01:08,585
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

24
00:01:08,885 --> 00:01:10,706
[SPEAKER_23]: Why did they have to take the word gay?

25
00:01:12,327 --> 00:01:14,769
[SPEAKER_01]: No one expects us to punish a physician.

26
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:16,090
[SPEAKER_01]: It's him, though.

27
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:16,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey!

28
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:20,726
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, Shut up!

29
00:01:20,926 --> 00:01:21,586
[SPEAKER_19]: Where's my gun?

30
00:01:21,726 --> 00:01:23,667
[SPEAKER_19]: This is my boomstick!

31
00:01:24,147 --> 00:01:26,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Sky, Come on girls, it's time to drop a bomb!

32
00:01:26,968 --> 00:01:30,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.

33
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,531
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of warped human being would find that funny?

34
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:37,853
[SPEAKER_07]: We are live and this is episode number 39 for April the 6th of 2003.

35
00:01:44,272 --> 00:01:51,039
[SPEAKER_03]: You're tuned into the Bomani Scene's most corrupted radio station of all things bee money.

36
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,900
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts.

37
00:01:53,061 --> 00:01:54,102
[SPEAKER_03]: You might know me as Sky.

38
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:58,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest buddy on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

39
00:01:58,806 --> 00:02:00,328
[SPEAKER_03]: You know her better as DarkSakura.

40
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:03,190
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate the buzz, you guys.

41
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:03,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I really hate it.

42
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:05,573
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing we can do right now.

43
00:02:05,813 --> 00:02:06,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

44
00:02:07,034 --> 00:02:08,736
[SPEAKER_03]: In this corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

45
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,192
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm against the wall, so technically it's not the corner.

46
00:02:14,452 --> 00:02:15,173
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in mid-wall.

47
00:02:15,713 --> 00:02:16,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly in the center.

48
00:02:18,756 --> 00:02:21,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Also with us tonight, we have a lot of fucking people in the house.

49
00:02:21,198 --> 00:02:23,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to... 23rMegas.

50
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:25,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Yo, what's up?

51
00:02:26,142 --> 00:02:27,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to DDR Angel.

52
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:31,086
[SPEAKER_14]: Still no comment!

53
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to Blackwab.

54
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:35,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to Dave.

55
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:36,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Bobby Cool.

56
00:02:37,996 --> 00:02:39,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to Intern Zero.

57
00:02:40,977 --> 00:02:42,177
[SPEAKER_10]: Unemployed people rock.

58
00:02:42,497 --> 00:02:43,978
[SPEAKER_03]: And say hello to Dark Tetsuya.

59
00:02:44,158 --> 00:02:45,858
[SPEAKER_10]: So I rock, huh?

60
00:02:46,398 --> 00:02:47,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

61
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:50,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I like Marin's answer here.

62
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,340
[SPEAKER_03]: We're outside.

63
00:02:52,495 --> 00:02:54,636
[SPEAKER_03]: So just imagine that buzzing you hear is the wind.

64
00:02:55,597 --> 00:02:56,537
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

65
00:02:57,037 --> 00:02:57,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Ow, I hurt.

66
00:02:58,058 --> 00:02:59,859
[SPEAKER_03]: No more Battle Royale in my living room.

67
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I won.

68
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so we have a lot of people here tonight.

69
00:03:04,321 --> 00:03:06,062
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we have a lot to talk about.

70
00:03:10,985 --> 00:03:12,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Fear the paper plates!

71
00:03:12,786 --> 00:03:13,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear good lord.

72
00:03:16,127 --> 00:03:22,112
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be talking to everybody a bit later, but first we're going to take a quick break featuring songs everybody hates.

73
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:22,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

74
00:03:24,414 --> 00:03:26,456
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to start it off with an old classic.

75
00:03:27,117 --> 00:03:28,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Garden of Love.

76
00:03:28,718 --> 00:03:29,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Rock.

77
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:32,982
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be right back in a little bit to have a big clusterfuck.

78
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:33,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy.

79
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:39,568
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, yeah.

80
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:42,050
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, what?

81
00:03:57,948 --> 00:04:00,190
[SPEAKER_20]: The vision's so deep that the eye can't see.

82
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,371
[SPEAKER_20]: If you don't know now, then let it be.

83
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:04,932
Get in the groove.

84
00:04:05,093 --> 00:04:08,775
[SPEAKER_20]: You can come and go with me.

85
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:11,096
[SPEAKER_20]: Just flow with me.

86
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:13,057
[SPEAKER_20]: You can speak low to me.

87
00:04:14,238 --> 00:04:15,599
[SPEAKER_20]: In the garden of love.

88
00:04:28,064 --> 00:04:30,706
[SPEAKER_20]: The only real thing that speaks so true

89
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:09,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

90
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,444
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

91
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:45,959
[SPEAKER_13]: Challenging move.

92
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,363
[SPEAKER_19]: Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

93
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:44,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Because Bongo demands it.

94
00:09:02,428 --> 00:09:03,429
[SPEAKER_19]: Everyone die!

95
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:04,569
[SPEAKER_03]: The sound card sucks.

96
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my bad.

97
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:13,575
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you'll just have to deal with it until we move into the new studio for season number three, and then we won't have the buzz anymore.

98
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Or we'll just have to do every show from Jamie's from now on.

99
00:09:16,096 --> 00:09:17,157
[SPEAKER_19]: Buy me a new sound card.

100
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:22,740
[SPEAKER_03]: So, wow, what a week, huh?

101
00:09:24,614 --> 00:09:26,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's been a while since we've been on the air.

102
00:09:26,195 --> 00:09:29,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not really, because if you guys were listening last week, you heard us live at Shaft.

103
00:09:30,018 --> 00:09:32,919
[SPEAKER_03]: About this time was March Madness.

104
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Two years ago, you would have heard us live at Shaft.

105
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:35,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit.

106
00:09:37,353 --> 00:09:40,977
[SPEAKER_02]: With the entire audience in here, who's actually listening to this outside?

107
00:09:41,738 --> 00:09:43,320
[SPEAKER_03]: That is an excellent question.

108
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,845
[SPEAKER_03]: The numbers in the studio are all-time high, the numbers on the web, all-time low.

109
00:09:47,925 --> 00:09:49,647
[SPEAKER_03]: No, hello to all of you listening, we appreciate it.

110
00:09:51,228 --> 00:09:52,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, live from Shaft, my bad.

111
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,693
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm at an all-time high by myself.

112
00:09:55,793 --> 00:09:56,334
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know.

113
00:09:56,634 --> 00:09:58,136
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's not about mics either.

114
00:10:00,357 --> 00:10:02,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Live from March Madness last week, if you were listening.

115
00:10:04,978 --> 00:10:10,700
[SPEAKER_03]: About this time was when DDR... Oh, the buzz went away for like half a second.

116
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,120
[SPEAKER_03]: It was amazing.

117
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,681
[SPEAKER_03]: This was about the time that DDR Idol was finishing up.

118
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:23,884
[SPEAKER_03]: This was probably about the time that, oh, I don't know, maybe 23rd Magus was taking the stage right after Dr. Dick finished his routines.

119
00:10:25,796 --> 00:10:27,017
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you shaking the microphones for?

120
00:10:27,057 --> 00:10:31,621
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, you have two more mics, so why don't you try swapping one?

121
00:10:31,641 --> 00:10:32,761
[SPEAKER_03]: It won't help, trust me.

122
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Trust me, I've done everything to do this buzz.

123
00:10:34,803 --> 00:10:36,825
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the noise of the hard drive.

124
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,026
[SPEAKER_03]: The power of Christ compels you!

125
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:41,468
[SPEAKER_08]: The power of Christ compels you!

126
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:42,849
[SPEAKER_03]: He just made it worse.

127
00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:45,571
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the noise of the hard drive in there.

128
00:10:46,392 --> 00:10:46,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Or something.

129
00:10:47,093 --> 00:10:47,673
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucked up.

130
00:10:48,434 --> 00:10:51,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway... So, yeah, tournament...

131
00:10:52,489 --> 00:10:53,370
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you guys think?

132
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,411
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you guys think of those of you that went to March Madness?

133
00:10:56,451 --> 00:10:56,832
[SPEAKER_03]: How was it?

134
00:10:57,332 --> 00:11:07,558
[SPEAKER_09]: A B. Nice toss, Rob.

135
00:11:07,618 --> 00:11:09,059
[SPEAKER_09]: B in my paradise sucks.

136
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:11,600
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate it.

137
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,961
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's Mr. Wendell.

138
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,262
[SPEAKER_02]: He makes everything good.

139
00:11:15,382 --> 00:11:16,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but not for B.A.

140
00:11:18,584 --> 00:11:19,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, not for me.

141
00:11:19,644 --> 00:11:20,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, you got owned.

142
00:11:20,985 --> 00:11:21,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up.

143
00:11:21,685 --> 00:11:22,666
[SPEAKER_02]: I had never played this.

144
00:11:23,186 --> 00:11:23,526
[SPEAKER_02]: You got owned.

145
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:25,107
[SPEAKER_02]: I had never played it before.

146
00:11:25,187 --> 00:11:26,247
[SPEAKER_02]: But you got owned.

147
00:11:26,307 --> 00:11:27,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut the fuck up, man.

148
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:28,208
[SPEAKER_14]: Owned.

149
00:11:28,228 --> 00:11:29,168
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude.

150
00:11:29,248 --> 00:11:30,389
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me say something.

151
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:31,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Jeez, okay.

152
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:33,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't want to couple doubles.

153
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:34,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Sucked.

154
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:41,893
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, and Xenon also sucked because it does, and it's really hard to PA.

155
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:43,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck that.

156
00:11:43,974 --> 00:11:46,975
[SPEAKER_05]: As for me, I came, I saw, I twitched.

157
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,402
[SPEAKER_02]: The left arrow in Sakura sucks.

158
00:11:51,283 --> 00:11:51,964
[SPEAKER_07]: The fuck is that?

159
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:52,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Stealing a mic?

160
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,248
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in my hand and you're just like, wank?

161
00:11:55,288 --> 00:11:56,209
[SPEAKER_07]: The fuck is that?

162
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,353
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't let me get a comment in before you have to say some shit.

163
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:01,575
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't see shit.

164
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:02,816
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't do shit.

165
00:12:02,836 --> 00:12:05,019
[SPEAKER_19]: But sitting in that back room for both days...

166
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:07,910
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow, people flaked out on me.

167
00:12:08,391 --> 00:12:10,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you know how it feels.

168
00:12:12,614 --> 00:12:12,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

169
00:12:14,595 --> 00:12:17,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie was well done by the time that was over.

170
00:12:17,197 --> 00:12:18,378
[SPEAKER_03]: She was cooking in that room there.

171
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:19,379
[SPEAKER_19]: I hated people.

172
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:20,520
[SPEAKER_19]: But we loved Jamie.

173
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,801
[SPEAKER_19]: I wanted everybody to die.

174
00:12:21,961 --> 00:12:23,842
[SPEAKER_03]: We loved Jamie for, you know, helping out.

175
00:12:23,862 --> 00:12:24,543
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a good time.

176
00:12:24,723 --> 00:12:25,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Making everything run.

177
00:12:25,764 --> 00:12:27,325
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you got visited by lots of people.

178
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I did.

179
00:12:28,046 --> 00:12:29,206
[SPEAKER_03]: And you got to eat bubbles with me.

180
00:12:29,787 --> 00:12:30,507
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't eat bubbles.

181
00:12:30,547 --> 00:12:30,968
[SPEAKER_19]: I blew them.

182
00:12:38,635 --> 00:12:38,895
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob?

183
00:12:39,396 --> 00:12:40,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

184
00:12:40,256 --> 00:12:40,477
[SPEAKER_14]: Ow!

185
00:12:42,598 --> 00:12:43,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob died again.

186
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:48,083
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, someone had to do the organizational stuff, and we're all grateful that Jamie didn't bother to sit back there.

187
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:52,567
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would have done it myself, but I was locked up in that goddamn glass box.

188
00:12:53,327 --> 00:12:57,050
[SPEAKER_02]: And trust me, it sucks hard being able to see the tournament and not hear a damn thing.

189
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially on DDR.

190
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,593
[SPEAKER_19]: I heard everything and didn't see a damn thing.

191
00:13:02,055 --> 00:13:03,636
[SPEAKER_19]: By the way, hold out your arm.

192
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:05,738
[SPEAKER_19]: You're dead too.

193
00:13:08,015 --> 00:13:10,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie hit me with the tail of a furry thing.

194
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:18,506
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I would have loved to have helped Jamie out in the back room, but I was too busy smoking and drinking behind everyone's backs.

195
00:13:18,626 --> 00:13:19,747
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll have to forgive Jamie.

196
00:13:19,787 --> 00:13:21,849
[SPEAKER_10]: She's been on a Battle Royale kick lately.

197
00:13:23,731 --> 00:13:25,032
[SPEAKER_10]: We all have.

198
00:13:26,594 --> 00:13:27,975
[SPEAKER_08]: And we played mocap golf.

199
00:13:28,156 --> 00:13:28,876
[SPEAKER_08]: That was...

200
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Only because it freaking rode over for like three holes and then you happened to get lucky and win one.

201
00:13:35,502 --> 00:13:36,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, it would have kicked your ass.

202
00:13:37,043 --> 00:13:37,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, shut up.

203
00:13:38,624 --> 00:13:40,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, who won the long drive?

204
00:13:40,925 --> 00:13:41,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's right.

205
00:13:41,525 --> 00:13:43,146
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I won the long drive.

206
00:13:43,426 --> 00:13:44,106
[SPEAKER_09]: So watch this.

207
00:13:44,146 --> 00:13:44,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut the hell up.

208
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:47,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Drive for show, putt for dough, bitch.

209
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:48,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

210
00:13:50,165 --> 00:13:53,446
[SPEAKER_26]: Dude, I hit a 50-foot chip to make an eagle.

211
00:13:53,986 --> 00:13:54,446
[SPEAKER_09]: So?

212
00:13:54,846 --> 00:13:55,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, wow.

213
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:56,567
[SPEAKER_09]: It was cool.

214
00:13:56,727 --> 00:13:58,907
[SPEAKER_09]: I've made chips for eagles and birdies before.

215
00:13:58,947 --> 00:13:59,307
[SPEAKER_09]: It's easy.

216
00:13:59,707 --> 00:14:00,028
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

217
00:14:00,228 --> 00:14:00,808
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, you know what?

218
00:14:00,848 --> 00:14:02,668
[SPEAKER_26]: That was my first one, so you can shut your mouth.

219
00:14:03,128 --> 00:14:05,989
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey, have you actually ever gotten par on that one that goes uphill?

220
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,310
[SPEAKER_26]: The one that goes, like, really, really steep uphill?

221
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I have gotten par on that twice.

222
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:15,952
[SPEAKER_26]: Goddamn, I got, like, a quadruple bogey on that shit.

223
00:14:16,412 --> 00:14:17,052
[SPEAKER_06]: I have propel.

224
00:14:17,822 --> 00:14:20,924
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the reason why golf is on TV and no one watches it.

225
00:14:22,185 --> 00:14:24,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, welcome to Orange Lounge, MoCap Golf Radio.

226
00:14:24,587 --> 00:14:26,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone must watch it, they have the golf channel.

227
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:28,530
[SPEAKER_19]: I want MoCap Battle Royale.

228
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,651
[SPEAKER_19]: I want MoCap Battle Royale.

229
00:14:30,671 --> 00:14:31,512
[SPEAKER_03]: MoCap napping.

230
00:14:32,253 --> 00:14:39,618
[SPEAKER_19]: I want somebody, anyone who has programming skill, get like, you know, Quake or one of those things, what was it you were saying, Counter-Strike?

231
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,087
[SPEAKER_19]: and make the Battle Royale Counter-Strike.

232
00:14:43,828 --> 00:14:50,656
[SPEAKER_27]: Wait, let me just say that real quick, some guy hit a 357-yard drive and got like a 63 to win some championship or something, course record.

233
00:14:51,176 --> 00:14:52,718
[SPEAKER_27]: Good, but God still hates him.

234
00:14:53,318 --> 00:14:54,660
[SPEAKER_27]: 357 yards in one haul.

235
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,621
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, in real life.

236
00:14:55,921 --> 00:14:57,023
God hates golfers.

237
00:14:58,641 --> 00:15:01,065
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, why does Dave look like he's Obi-Wan over here?

238
00:15:01,626 --> 00:15:04,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Golf is paid for by morons who buy ugly pants.

239
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,851
[SPEAKER_19]: Use the force.

240
00:15:05,251 --> 00:15:06,113
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyways, no.

241
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:08,957
[SPEAKER_19]: That's why plaid will never go out of fashion because of golfers.

242
00:15:09,137 --> 00:15:10,439
[SPEAKER_06]: And scotchmen.

243
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:11,200
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you said...

244
00:15:14,842 --> 00:15:21,549
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you said that Counter-Strike sucks for doing it, but for Battle Royale, Counter-Strike is like the best thing to edit.

245
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:22,730
[SPEAKER_06]: I hit a vital organ.

246
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,233
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the easiest thing to do.

247
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:33,621
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the way, yes, thank you for asking, yes, I did compete last week in freestyle, and I got all fails!

248
00:15:34,462 --> 00:15:36,504
[SPEAKER_03]: How did that go, your very first freestyle?

249
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:57,218
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a nervous breakdown about five minutes before it was my turn because I fell playing a challenge in front of everybody and then I freaked out and then I got up and finally played and I think I did alright for my first but it's old school and no one likes old school anymore so fuck them.

250
00:15:57,238 --> 00:15:58,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't start that again.

251
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:05,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and for those of you in the chatroom and listening who got to hear my lovely little rant remember it because you'll never hear it again.

252
00:16:06,638 --> 00:16:09,259
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to know who those chicks were that were massaging my hair.

253
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:14,080
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea who those people were and they're just like coming up to me, rubbing up against me for DVDs.

254
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I got the DVDs, yeah.

255
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:17,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, hold on, I've realized something.

256
00:16:18,782 --> 00:16:22,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't steal a girl's glasses because then she follows you around and annoys all your friends.

257
00:16:23,263 --> 00:16:27,384
[SPEAKER_06]: She just had these cool glasses and I stole them and then she decided that she would try to like fuck everybody or something.

258
00:16:27,424 --> 00:16:28,725
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what it was she was doing.

259
00:16:29,105 --> 00:16:31,085
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what I was doing wrong when I was single.

260
00:16:31,426 --> 00:16:32,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't steal glasses.

261
00:16:33,306 --> 00:16:34,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Mental notes.

262
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:35,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Steel glasses.

263
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you gotta steal the nerve glasses.

264
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:40,230
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's how I get the pre-teen booty.

265
00:16:41,271 --> 00:16:42,812
[SPEAKER_08]: They were hoes anyway, you could tell.

266
00:16:44,653 --> 00:16:45,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.

267
00:16:46,294 --> 00:16:47,835
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-oh, looks like you hit a nerve.

268
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:59,502
[SPEAKER_19]: Like I was telling two friends after the first day of the tourney, what walks on two legs and spells slut?

269
00:16:59,762 --> 00:17:00,062
[SPEAKER_19]: What?

270
00:17:00,863 --> 00:17:01,723
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not saying it on the air.

271
00:17:01,763 --> 00:17:01,923
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

272
00:17:08,188 --> 00:17:13,150
[SPEAKER_03]: This is quiet, so... Oh, what I need is a good defense.

273
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,211
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyways, yeah, it was Let the Beat Hit Em that I freestyled to.

274
00:17:18,012 --> 00:17:18,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Watch the video.

275
00:17:19,213 --> 00:17:23,774
[SPEAKER_06]: It's another white guy freestyling, or some white guy doing Let the Beat Hit Em.

276
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:24,735
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what the title is.

277
00:17:24,895 --> 00:17:26,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's what you got titled as, Some White Guy.

278
00:17:26,896 --> 00:17:27,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Some White Guy.

279
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:28,917
[SPEAKER_06]: I am Some White Guy.

280
00:17:29,237 --> 00:17:29,877
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

281
00:17:31,872 --> 00:17:32,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Xerox.

282
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he didn't even get my song.

283
00:17:34,613 --> 00:17:35,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, fuck that shit.

284
00:17:35,994 --> 00:17:42,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, it's fucking clearly zero space X. I don't know where the fuck somebody gets Xerox.

285
00:17:43,216 --> 00:17:47,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it doesn't even start with an X. I mean, fucking go to school.

286
00:17:48,925 --> 00:17:49,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck you.

287
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:50,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Go bite.

288
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:51,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Fucking morons.

289
00:17:51,647 --> 00:17:52,787
[SPEAKER_10]: At least you got your name.

290
00:17:53,168 --> 00:17:57,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Except that you have to realize that when everybody sees that, everybody says Xerox.

291
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Blah, blah, blah, fuck you.

292
00:17:59,972 --> 00:18:01,333
[SPEAKER_02]: When everybody is saying Xerox.

293
00:18:01,353 --> 00:18:01,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't matter.

294
00:18:02,353 --> 00:18:03,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Xerox.

295
00:18:06,236 --> 00:18:08,117
[SPEAKER_19]: Hooked on phonics works for me.

296
00:18:08,197 --> 00:18:08,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Not for them.

297
00:18:09,278 --> 00:18:10,499
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got yellow fever.

298
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,261
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a snake in my boot.

299
00:18:14,401 --> 00:18:17,263
[SPEAKER_03]: They were reading it as one word because they thought it was Asian typing.

300
00:18:19,847 --> 00:18:23,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hey, my first tournament in March Madness last year, I was Electoddle or something?

301
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:27,830
[SPEAKER_06]: No, okay.

302
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:31,611
[SPEAKER_06]: I looked at that paper, and it was clearly written, Zero Eggs.

303
00:18:31,692 --> 00:18:34,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you were that big of a moron, I'm sorry.

304
00:18:34,633 --> 00:18:38,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you just thought you were Leet to Xerox, with a Z. You know what?

305
00:18:38,954 --> 00:18:39,935
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't give a fuck!

306
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:41,195
[SPEAKER_06]: You could go to school!

307
00:18:41,475 --> 00:18:42,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Go buy a Xerox machine!

308
00:18:43,776 --> 00:18:44,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still Ski.

309
00:18:47,145 --> 00:18:50,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I guess that makes it a little better, but I'm still not fucking Xeroxed.

310
00:18:50,387 --> 00:18:53,568
[SPEAKER_10]: At least you're not some white guy doing some song.

311
00:18:54,029 --> 00:18:59,091
[SPEAKER_06]: I am some white guy, and I swear to God if another face goes in my hand, if another hand goes in my face, I'm gonna punch somebody.

312
00:18:59,612 --> 00:19:00,412
[SPEAKER_06]: I'M BLIND!

313
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:03,314
[SPEAKER_19]: What up, my honkies?

314
00:19:05,695 --> 00:19:06,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I am some white guy.

315
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:10,117
[SPEAKER_06]: You are some white guy, but I am the OTHER white guy.

316
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:11,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, freestyler.

317
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:13,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever, intern.

318
00:19:13,639 --> 00:19:14,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, intern, that's a threat.

319
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Intern!

320
00:19:16,969 --> 00:19:18,730
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, at least he's part of staff.

321
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:20,852
[SPEAKER_02]: I die.

322
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:25,395
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, with the pee.

323
00:19:26,716 --> 00:19:27,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving right along.

324
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:32,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about why everyone's here right now.

325
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,681
[SPEAKER_19]: They're not here to see me.

326
00:19:35,802 --> 00:19:39,204
[SPEAKER_03]: I think actually the celebrity of the weekend would be DDR Angel, who's back.

327
00:19:39,685 --> 00:19:40,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and then Jamie.

328
00:19:41,526 --> 00:19:44,188
[SPEAKER_03]: So Angel, you've been where for the past five weeks?

329
00:19:46,526 --> 00:19:49,228
[SPEAKER_18]: I missed all of you guys for five weeks, but that's okay.

330
00:19:49,528 --> 00:19:50,549
[SPEAKER_03]: What part of Japan did you go to?

331
00:19:51,209 --> 00:19:58,633
[SPEAKER_18]: I went to Kyushu Island, which is basically the southernmost, almost the southernmost part of Japan.

332
00:19:59,694 --> 00:20:02,175
[SPEAKER_18]: Kyushu Island, Kagoshima City, it was cool.

333
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:04,157
[SPEAKER_03]: So what kind of stuff did you get to see while you were there?

334
00:20:04,897 --> 00:20:05,577
[SPEAKER_18]: You want to hear a story?

335
00:20:05,778 --> 00:20:06,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's hear a story.

336
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:07,018
[SPEAKER_18]: A funny story?

337
00:20:07,158 --> 00:20:07,639
[SPEAKER_18]: Yay!

338
00:20:08,459 --> 00:20:10,300
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I thought it was funny, but okay.

339
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,962
[SPEAKER_18]: That was the first time the buzz stopped.

340
00:20:13,202 --> 00:20:14,463
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, just ignore the buzz.

341
00:20:14,483 --> 00:20:14,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up!

342
00:20:15,717 --> 00:20:21,480
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, alright, so I went shopping one day with my relatives and my mother and whatever.

343
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:23,702
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so I walk into the store.

344
00:20:24,722 --> 00:20:26,303
[SPEAKER_18]: What do I hear right outside the door?

345
00:20:27,364 --> 00:20:28,044
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR music.

346
00:20:29,345 --> 00:20:34,448
[SPEAKER_18]: I run to the store frantically looking for a DDR machine going, I gotta play, I gotta play, I gotta play.

347
00:20:35,128 --> 00:20:36,709
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I sounded like Loki, okay?

348
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:38,270
[SPEAKER_18]: Where's the machine?

349
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:38,810
[SPEAKER_18]: Where's the machine?

350
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:39,370
[SPEAKER_18]: Where's the machine?

351
00:20:41,812 --> 00:20:42,612
[SPEAKER_18]: Did I find it?

352
00:20:43,052 --> 00:20:43,833
[SPEAKER_18]: Did I find it?

353
00:20:44,645 --> 00:20:46,786
[SPEAKER_18]: No, no, no, I didn't find it.

354
00:20:47,806 --> 00:20:51,648
[SPEAKER_18]: I ended up noticing that it was coming from the freaking loudspeaker!

355
00:20:53,348 --> 00:21:01,771
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I walk up to this lady that was working there, and I kindly ask her, was it her CD?

356
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:04,693
[SPEAKER_18]: Just, you know, by the off chance that it might have been.

357
00:21:05,353 --> 00:21:07,053
[SPEAKER_18]: And she said no, that it was the store's.

358
00:21:07,073 --> 00:21:07,113
[SPEAKER_18]: So,

359
00:21:15,623 --> 00:21:16,064
[SPEAKER_18]: No, no, no.

360
00:21:16,804 --> 00:21:19,066
[SPEAKER_18]: See, because then I said, can I buy it?

361
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:28,455
[SPEAKER_18]: And then she looked at me like a weird look, or with a weird look, and then she was probably saying in her head, you stupid American.

362
00:21:28,475 --> 00:21:30,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I got to go to one.

363
00:21:36,553 --> 00:21:39,956
[SPEAKER_18]: I got to play some Japanese people, and they thought I was cool, and they thought I was really good.

364
00:21:40,837 --> 00:21:41,778
[SPEAKER_18]: And I kicked his ass.

365
00:21:42,158 --> 00:21:42,779
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

366
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,160
[SPEAKER_03]: But did you actually play DDR?

367
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:44,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I did.

368
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,422
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were actually other people playing DDR?

369
00:21:46,562 --> 00:21:46,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

370
00:21:47,003 --> 00:21:47,823
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew it was rumors.

371
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:49,165
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I played Poppin' Music 9.

372
00:21:49,765 --> 00:21:50,606
[SPEAKER_03]: How was Poppin' Music?

373
00:21:50,926 --> 00:21:57,813
[SPEAKER_18]: Poppin' Music was okay, but unfortunately... Sorry, Joe, but... Can I do that?

374
00:21:57,933 --> 00:21:58,093
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

375
00:21:59,982 --> 00:22:09,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, we were playing Poppin' Music here last night because our new Vimani friend Garrett brought it over and it has Boa Boa Lady Another on it.

376
00:22:10,265 --> 00:22:15,066
[SPEAKER_02]: That in itself made my day.

377
00:22:15,086 --> 00:22:16,786
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still going on the Japan trip.

378
00:22:16,826 --> 00:22:17,686
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll catch up to present.

379
00:22:17,706 --> 00:22:18,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Where was it?

380
00:22:18,827 --> 00:22:19,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Poppin' Music 9.

381
00:22:19,327 --> 00:22:20,887
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right, Poppin' Music 9.

382
00:22:21,587 --> 00:22:23,968
[SPEAKER_18]: Now what was the rumor that was going around for Poppin' Music 9?

383
00:22:26,147 --> 00:22:26,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolute.

384
00:22:27,189 --> 00:22:28,530
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, Absolute.

385
00:22:29,031 --> 00:22:30,513
[SPEAKER_18]: I played Absolute.

386
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:31,554
[SPEAKER_18]: And what did I do?

387
00:22:32,235 --> 00:22:32,815
[SPEAKER_18]: What did I do?

388
00:22:33,376 --> 00:22:34,137
[SPEAKER_18]: I passed it.

389
00:22:34,658 --> 00:22:35,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

390
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,501
[SPEAKER_18]: There is proof.

391
00:22:37,601 --> 00:22:38,542
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob has proof.

392
00:22:38,642 --> 00:22:39,944
Tron was in it.

393
00:22:41,025 --> 00:22:41,806
[SPEAKER_18]: Tron was in it.

394
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:42,347
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

395
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:53,163
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, Dark Tootsie apparently thought it was a rumor, I don't know.

396
00:22:53,223 --> 00:22:54,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, whatever.

397
00:22:54,244 --> 00:22:56,366
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know it's really there and all that jazz.

398
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:04,454
[SPEAKER_27]: Speaking of which, I will be going to Japan in two weeks, for two weeks, so that will be cool.

399
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:07,036
[SPEAKER_18]: Dave gets a squee!

400
00:23:07,717 --> 00:23:13,903
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm going to Tokyo and Kyoto and Osaka, and I'm not going to buy you porn, what, what?

401
00:23:14,743 --> 00:23:15,044
[SPEAKER_27]: Why?

402
00:23:15,124 --> 00:23:23,810
[SPEAKER_27]: Because my brother is there right now and we're going to see him because over the summer he will be in Tokyo doing something for work or something like that.

403
00:23:24,491 --> 00:23:25,792
[SPEAKER_27]: And so he'll be doing something.

404
00:23:26,653 --> 00:23:28,894
[SPEAKER_27]: And so we're going to see him because it'll be like the last time.

405
00:23:29,555 --> 00:23:35,159
[SPEAKER_27]: And I'm going to be in Tokyo for three days and then I think Osaka for like a week and Kyoto for a few days.

406
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:35,680
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know.

407
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:44,785
[SPEAKER_27]: and I will go to an arcade and I will see if... Yeah, I'll go to the really big one in Tokyo and I'll be like, wow, there's no one playing DDR.

408
00:23:45,565 --> 00:23:55,131
[SPEAKER_27]: Like my brother took a... My brother took a... He went to a fairly large arcade there and they had a whole Bomani corner and he took a picture of it.

409
00:23:55,611 --> 00:23:56,451
[SPEAKER_27]: It was empty.

410
00:23:57,052 --> 00:23:58,452
[SPEAKER_27]: There was no one playing.

411
00:23:59,253 --> 00:24:02,695
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey Dave, do you really want to get drunk in Japan?

412
00:24:05,462 --> 00:24:06,303
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

413
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:07,404
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

414
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,507
[SPEAKER_18]: Because, uh, I know a really quick way.

415
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:11,968
[SPEAKER_18]: How?

416
00:24:12,729 --> 00:24:19,475
[SPEAKER_18]: Go to a vending machine that has beer, and, like, nobody's watching you, still have money in it, and you can get beer and get drunk.

417
00:24:20,396 --> 00:24:21,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Japanese beer isn't that good.

418
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:22,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but they have sake, too!

419
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, I have a question for Angel.

420
00:24:29,578 --> 00:24:31,139
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I have a serious question for Angel.

421
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:38,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Were there any other interesting games that you saw there, like new games that a lot of people seem to be playing, like maybe outside of Bomani or any other kinds of games that seem to be kind of popular?

422
00:24:38,843 --> 00:24:39,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that caught your eye?

423
00:24:40,403 --> 00:24:43,985
[SPEAKER_18]: Something about, I think it was like Midnight something, I don't know.

424
00:24:44,826 --> 00:24:46,246
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of game was it, like a fighting game?

425
00:24:46,547 --> 00:24:49,748
[SPEAKER_18]: It seemed like it was a racing game, so maybe it's another initial day.

426
00:24:50,008 --> 00:24:51,229
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, Midnight Club.

427
00:24:52,369 --> 00:24:53,190
[SPEAKER_18]: Midnight Club, that was right.

428
00:24:54,489 --> 00:24:58,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Initial D is also ridiculously popular in the Asian sector.

429
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,711
[SPEAKER_02]: There were like five Initial D machines in this arcade I saw in Singapore.

430
00:25:02,031 --> 00:25:04,912
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the freaking airport in Korea, they had an Initial D machine.

431
00:25:05,392 --> 00:25:13,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Which leads me to believe that, you know... And they had a pump-it-up machine in Korea, so... Um... What about Bunga Bunga?

432
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:14,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see that by chance?

433
00:25:15,355 --> 00:25:16,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Um... A Bunga.

434
00:25:17,036 --> 00:25:17,216
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

435
00:25:18,696 --> 00:25:19,396
[SPEAKER_03]: The spanking game.

436
00:25:19,416 --> 00:25:20,697
[SPEAKER_18]: You wanna know something else that was funny?

437
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:21,157
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

438
00:25:23,123 --> 00:25:28,306
[SPEAKER_18]: Randomly, there was Rhythm and Police playing in the background of the news.

439
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:30,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the same version from DDR?

440
00:25:30,907 --> 00:25:31,127
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

441
00:25:31,747 --> 00:25:32,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

442
00:25:33,068 --> 00:25:34,348
[SPEAKER_18]: I was like, oh my god!

443
00:25:34,668 --> 00:25:35,609
[SPEAKER_18]: It's Rhythm and Police!

444
00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:38,910
[SPEAKER_18]: My uncle and my aunt and everybody was looking at me and I'm like, sorry.

445
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,491
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, now I'm considered crazy.

446
00:25:40,531 --> 00:25:40,951
[SPEAKER_18]: Great.

447
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get to eat at Americatown?

448
00:25:45,153 --> 00:25:46,594
[SPEAKER_03]: For anybody that saw The Simpsons.

449
00:25:47,148 --> 00:25:51,189
[SPEAKER_18]: What in the... Alright, whatever.

450
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:55,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there's this episode of The Simpsons where they go to Japan, and Homer's, you know, they want to, where do they want to eat?

451
00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:03,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Homer wants to go, Homer wants to go eat in America Town, and Marge is like, we could eat American food back home, but he insists they go to America Town, it's just funny.

452
00:26:03,191 --> 00:26:08,092
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the waiter's like, hi, I am stupid American waiter, can I take your order?

453
00:26:08,412 --> 00:26:09,853
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like meat food?

454
00:26:12,748 --> 00:26:14,049
[SPEAKER_03]: It was worth a shot, I had to see it.

455
00:26:14,129 --> 00:26:18,950
[SPEAKER_19]: When you go, when you go, you have to, I'll get you the address for the, um, Taito Arcade.

456
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:24,552
[SPEAKER_19]: You need to go there and take me pictures, because I want to go there to, like, see, like, the Rose and Rosa Pond, you know, bubble bubble machine.

457
00:26:24,572 --> 00:26:28,274
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many people I know going to Japan in, like, next week or two, it's crazy.

458
00:26:28,294 --> 00:26:29,714
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going in a couple, couple years.

459
00:26:30,095 --> 00:26:36,637
[SPEAKER_02]: No, seriously, my roommate's going to Japan for a year, Angel just came back to Japan, Dave's now going to Japan, one of my really good friends in Seattle is going to Japan.

460
00:26:36,657 --> 00:26:38,878
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got so much shit coming back for me, it's not even funny.

461
00:26:39,538 --> 00:26:41,378
[SPEAKER_19]: You have to bring me back a magazine.

462
00:26:41,739 --> 00:26:46,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave, I have another quick request.

463
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,561
[SPEAKER_03]: If I loaned you a remote kit, would you go and do interviews with people in the arcade?

464
00:26:52,281 --> 00:26:53,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you just do random interviews?

465
00:26:53,601 --> 00:26:56,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, Bakagaijin on the street would be the greatest segment ever.

466
00:26:57,542 --> 00:26:59,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupid American in Japan, come on, you gotta do it.

467
00:27:00,723 --> 00:27:02,764
[SPEAKER_05]: What would I interview them on?

468
00:27:03,225 --> 00:27:04,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Bramante, you've got to go to the arcade.

469
00:27:04,385 --> 00:27:05,926
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to go to an arcade while you're there, right?

470
00:27:05,946 --> 00:27:06,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

471
00:27:06,367 --> 00:27:09,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Just say, hey, I'm from the American media.

472
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:17,674
[SPEAKER_03]: And say, there's this really big American show, and I want to talk to you about this game that's taking over America.

473
00:27:18,034 --> 00:27:20,536
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll probably go, huh?

474
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:21,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to a random businessman.

475
00:27:21,997 --> 00:27:22,637
[SPEAKER_02]: I could try.

476
00:27:22,737 --> 00:27:23,137
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean...

477
00:27:26,474 --> 00:27:27,815
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't know.

478
00:27:29,035 --> 00:27:30,856
[SPEAKER_03]: And then go, Orange Lounge Radio, yee!

479
00:27:33,858 --> 00:27:36,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Say you're from Orange Lounge Radio, you'll get laughed out of the country.

480
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:37,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

481
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,981
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Banzai!

482
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:45,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, State Yasuo on the show.

483
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:47,485
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait, wait, wait, Rob!

484
00:27:48,288 --> 00:27:49,309
[SPEAKER_18]: Another random sighting.

485
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:50,110
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

486
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:56,096
[SPEAKER_18]: Synchronized love during a car commercial with like a bunch of para girls in black and yeah, my friend had a cow.

487
00:27:56,456 --> 00:27:59,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see, did you happen to get to see any para clubs?

488
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:00,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Or did you get to go to any para clubs?

489
00:28:00,861 --> 00:28:02,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you go to a store that sold big boots?

490
00:28:03,263 --> 00:28:03,523
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

491
00:28:04,584 --> 00:28:04,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Boring.

492
00:28:06,132 --> 00:28:16,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but, uh, I was at this... Remember, Pa... Remember, Pa is a big thing in, like, Tokyo and Osaka, and she wasn't, like, there, so... True.

493
00:28:16,536 --> 00:28:16,856
[SPEAKER_03]: True enough.

494
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:20,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so anything else you want to tell us about your trip?

495
00:28:20,257 --> 00:28:21,598
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, not much, except, uh...

496
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:30,780
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to post that one picture of that unmentionable thing that I was talking about that nobody knows about in America.

497
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,240
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to find it.

498
00:28:32,581 --> 00:28:33,381
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll find it for you.

499
00:28:33,401 --> 00:28:33,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

500
00:28:33,902 --> 00:28:34,762
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have to find it later.

501
00:28:35,843 --> 00:28:36,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Neat.

502
00:28:36,763 --> 00:28:39,245
[SPEAKER_18]: I have an FU about everything later, by the way.

503
00:28:40,146 --> 00:28:40,906
[SPEAKER_18]: If that's okay with you.

504
00:28:40,946 --> 00:28:41,867
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do FUs later.

505
00:28:42,207 --> 00:28:42,407
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

506
00:28:43,928 --> 00:28:44,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Super toilet?

507
00:28:44,548 --> 00:28:44,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

508
00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:45,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe?

509
00:28:47,449 --> 00:28:48,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so, moving right along.

510
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,691
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Angel comes back into town.

511
00:28:50,751 --> 00:28:53,672
[SPEAKER_03]: We decided to have a little welcome home party last night, so that's why everybody was here.

512
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:56,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost everybody!

513
00:28:57,014 --> 00:29:01,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody forgot to, I don't know, inform me that this stuff was going on.

514
00:29:01,036 --> 00:29:04,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone's like, everyone's like, hey, you going to the party?

515
00:29:04,137 --> 00:29:04,418
[SPEAKER_07]: What party?

516
00:29:04,438 --> 00:29:06,539
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a freaking huge party here last night.

517
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:06,859
[SPEAKER_02]: There was like...

518
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:09,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally everybody was there and everybody was still here.

519
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:12,863
[SPEAKER_03]: It was not my job to send out the invitations.

520
00:29:12,963 --> 00:29:14,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought everybody knew through the chatroom.

521
00:29:14,785 --> 00:29:17,326
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought Angel was harassing everybody as they came to the chatroom.

522
00:29:17,346 --> 00:29:18,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to be a Rob Saturday?

523
00:29:18,407 --> 00:29:19,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to be a Rob Saturday?

524
00:29:19,428 --> 00:29:20,329
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even know.

525
00:29:20,349 --> 00:29:22,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit, I even brought my girlfriend, dude.

526
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:25,312
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even know about it until we looked in your live journal.

527
00:29:25,352 --> 00:29:27,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I didn't even know about it, so fuck you.

528
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:31,237
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought it up to her and she's like, what party?

529
00:29:31,497 --> 00:29:31,637
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

530
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:34,819
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't supposed to be a party.

531
00:29:34,879 --> 00:29:38,940
[SPEAKER_03]: It was supposed to be friends come over and we hang out and then we go to Scandia.

532
00:29:39,221 --> 00:29:42,142
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have a social gathering and have a good caravan that goes to Scandia.

533
00:29:42,202 --> 00:29:44,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Suddenly, oh my god, there's a party going on in my house.

534
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:46,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, dude, there was poppin' music.

535
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:48,664
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's poppin'.

536
00:29:49,925 --> 00:29:51,706
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're at Scandia, Nick.

537
00:29:52,386 --> 00:29:53,146
[SPEAKER_19]: I brought Germania.

538
00:29:53,866 --> 00:29:54,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you did, didn't you?

539
00:29:54,767 --> 00:29:55,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I did.

540
00:29:55,347 --> 00:29:57,588
[SPEAKER_02]: They were poppin'.

541
00:29:58,388 --> 00:30:01,029
[SPEAKER_26]: Rob's all like, angels coming, angels coming, angels coming.

542
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:02,490
[SPEAKER_26]: Do a theater near you.

543
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:28,156
[SPEAKER_03]: This summer, Angel Angel returns, coming to a theater near you this summer Anyway, yeah, hi So, we had a party and we watched Battle Royale because Angel hadn't seen this movie And if you haven't seen Battle Royale yet, Jamie, break it down Talk about what Battle Royale is all about for those that haven't seen

544
00:30:29,176 --> 00:30:41,987
[SPEAKER_19]: In the future, students boycott schools, so the Japanese government decides to enact the BR project, or the BR Act, which means that they pick a randomly selected 9th grade class, put them all on an island, and they have to kill each other until one's left.

545
00:30:44,122 --> 00:30:57,103
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot more symbolic meaning behind that True, but I like watching all the deaths But watching a whole bunch of really pretty Japanese people kill each other is a sheer joy in life Dude, it was all about Mitsuko I don't want to be a loser

546
00:31:00,643 --> 00:31:01,604
[SPEAKER_06]: He was my hero.

547
00:31:01,624 --> 00:31:02,885
[SPEAKER_02]: If he was a good guy, it would have been better.

548
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:08,471
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was a guy who had the radio that told me where everybody else was, I would have lived a lot longer than he did, you know?

549
00:31:09,992 --> 00:31:11,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, he lived a long time.

550
00:31:11,073 --> 00:31:12,775
[SPEAKER_19]: That was Hiroki who had the GPS.

551
00:31:13,255 --> 00:31:15,497
[SPEAKER_19]: My favorite was Mimura, the hacker.

552
00:31:16,678 --> 00:31:18,700
[SPEAKER_19]: He was so awesome.

553
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,343
[SPEAKER_19]: And I finally caught the pun of the name of his computer.

554
00:31:22,023 --> 00:31:22,524
[SPEAKER_19]: The third man.

555
00:31:23,985 --> 00:31:24,606
[SPEAKER_19]: After his own name.

556
00:31:27,426 --> 00:31:31,709
[SPEAKER_03]: But then of course after we watched Battle Royale What did you think of Battle Royale, Angel, the first time seeing it?

557
00:31:32,229 --> 00:31:56,546
[SPEAKER_03]: It kicked much ass And then we had much fun afterwards Yes, after we watched Battle Royale A Battle Royale broke out in my living room With paper plates and magic markers And scotch tape and red marker Yes, I wrote up name tags for people who died And how they died DDR Angel choked on a pretzel And all the time I was in the other room playing pop music

558
00:31:57,771 --> 00:31:59,192
[SPEAKER_06]: I got hit in the eye with a candle.

559
00:31:59,552 --> 00:32:00,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Choked on a pretzel.

560
00:32:00,693 --> 00:32:01,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I even want to know?

561
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:03,895
[SPEAKER_06]: She was hanging out with George Bush.

562
00:32:05,616 --> 00:32:07,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, now I know I don't want to know.

563
00:32:09,158 --> 00:32:13,280
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we're thinking, gee, how can we incorporate Battle Royale into our everyday lives?

564
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,842
[SPEAKER_03]: And one idea is maybe we could just go to QZAR and take our frustrations out that way.

565
00:32:17,203 --> 00:32:20,444
[SPEAKER_03]: But QZAR's not messy enough, so we decided maybe paintball.

566
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:21,805
[SPEAKER_03]: But then paintball's hurt.

567
00:32:21,845 --> 00:32:23,506
[SPEAKER_03]: They really do hurt when you get shot with it.

568
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:24,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't wear loose clothes.

569
00:32:24,827 --> 00:32:26,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Loose clothing doesn't hurt.

570
00:32:26,727 --> 00:32:27,788
[SPEAKER_07]: You talked to my friend, didn't you?

571
00:32:27,908 --> 00:32:29,649
[SPEAKER_07]: You're trying to get me to buy the gun as well!

572
00:32:29,869 --> 00:32:30,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn you!

573
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn you!

574
00:32:32,671 --> 00:32:33,712
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you, Andy!

575
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:35,353
[SPEAKER_07]: You've gotten to them also!

576
00:32:36,273 --> 00:32:39,175
[SPEAKER_19]: What we need to do is we actually need to make the survival packs.

577
00:32:40,276 --> 00:32:41,757
[SPEAKER_19]: And pick a place to go camping.

578
00:32:42,938 --> 00:32:46,400
[SPEAKER_19]: And we need to give one person a fan, give some person a pellet gun.

579
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:47,481
[SPEAKER_19]: You know...

580
00:32:54,264 --> 00:33:04,748
[SPEAKER_02]: When Battle Royale first came out, Tokyo Pop, the magazine, had this big, huge feature on it, and it had all the weapons that the kids that you didn't see on TV had, and there were some seriously ridiculous ones, like a pot lid.

581
00:33:04,868 --> 00:33:08,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, the pot lid was the best thing in the movie, and it even proved it.

582
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Battle Royale Online.com.

583
00:33:12,292 --> 00:33:12,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Go there.

584
00:33:14,214 --> 00:33:18,917
[SPEAKER_06]: The pot lid was the best, and everybody knows it, because it saved his life.

585
00:33:19,378 --> 00:33:22,340
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, the psycho guy, Kiriyama, he got the freaking Hadesan.

586
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,202
[SPEAKER_19]: He was my hero, and he killed everybody.

587
00:33:25,663 --> 00:33:32,308
[SPEAKER_19]: And one of the girls who was up on the mountain, one of them got the megaphone, the other girl with her got a headband that said, go for it.

588
00:33:34,944 --> 00:33:39,468
[SPEAKER_02]: But seriously, in my opinion, the best character was our, well, I'm not gonna give it away, so never mind.

589
00:33:39,628 --> 00:33:44,211
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite guy was the other foreign, the other exchange student, yeah.

590
00:33:44,332 --> 00:33:45,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, how would that give it away?

591
00:33:45,613 --> 00:33:49,135
[SPEAKER_02]: The one who helped him out, you know.

592
00:33:49,296 --> 00:33:50,537
[SPEAKER_06]: What would that point be?

593
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:52,718
[SPEAKER_06]: One more thing about Japan.

594
00:33:52,758 --> 00:33:53,399
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, go.

595
00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:53,819
[SPEAKER_18]: Rough.

596
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:54,300
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyways!

597
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,348
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you need now?

598
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh?

599
00:34:05,288 --> 00:34:05,748
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you need?

600
00:34:06,009 --> 00:34:09,230
[SPEAKER_18]: There's one thing that we rule over Japan, okay?

601
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:09,650
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

602
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:13,792
[SPEAKER_18]: I saw no, no extreme machines over there.

603
00:34:13,973 --> 00:34:14,213
[SPEAKER_18]: None.

604
00:34:14,873 --> 00:34:15,133
[SPEAKER_18]: None.

605
00:34:15,373 --> 00:34:15,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

606
00:34:16,334 --> 00:34:17,734
[SPEAKER_18]: And we have them all over the place.

607
00:34:17,754 --> 00:34:18,435
[SPEAKER_18]: So what happens?

608
00:34:18,895 --> 00:34:19,695
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR's dead.

609
00:34:20,136 --> 00:34:20,816
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR's dead.

610
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:24,598
[SPEAKER_18]: But that means I'm dead!

611
00:34:25,285 --> 00:34:25,785
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not dead.

612
00:34:26,085 --> 00:34:27,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the beginning of my name!

613
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:32,989
[SPEAKER_02]: In Japan, the life cycle for fads there is, like, ridiculously fast.

614
00:34:33,329 --> 00:34:33,750
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

615
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:37,712
[SPEAKER_03]: In a year, no, not even a year, in like three months, you're gonna change your nickname to 2DX Angel.

616
00:34:38,192 --> 00:34:39,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, why, what happens?

617
00:34:39,793 --> 00:34:44,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody gets frickin' burned out on DDR, and then they're all of a sudden, they're 2DX.

618
00:34:45,076 --> 00:34:47,137
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'll be 2DX Angel in three months, I guarantee it.

619
00:34:47,857 --> 00:34:50,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Is 2DX still big there, or is it, like, is all the monsters dead?

620
00:34:51,019 --> 00:34:52,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Trust me, she hasn't been getting very good.

621
00:34:53,881 --> 00:34:54,321
[SPEAKER_10]: Haven't you?

622
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:58,958
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, I got some, like, schoolgirls to, like, take a picture, so it was cool.

623
00:34:59,459 --> 00:35:02,201
[SPEAKER_10]: They were playing, and they were... Hey, you could pass 5-1-1.

624
00:35:02,261 --> 00:35:02,841
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki!

625
00:35:04,082 --> 00:35:06,004
[SPEAKER_18]: Would you like to make a comment on schoolgirls?

626
00:35:06,524 --> 00:35:08,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, schoolgirls.

627
00:35:11,688 --> 00:35:12,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Roses are red.

628
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:14,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Violets are blue.

629
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:15,631
[SPEAKER_02]: This show's about panties.

630
00:35:16,832 --> 00:35:20,034
[SPEAKER_02]: The back of the colorful DVD that Loki gave us all during March Madness.

631
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,258
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, what the fuck?

632
00:35:25,413 --> 00:35:27,273
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also got an alternate cover on the other side.

633
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:28,314
[SPEAKER_08]: More panty action.

634
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,794
[SPEAKER_08]: You actually see butt crack in that one.

635
00:35:31,074 --> 00:35:33,415
[SPEAKER_19]: I have, I have, I have man, man prong.

636
00:35:34,815 --> 00:35:45,097
[SPEAKER_03]: The one suggestion for Battle Royale that didn't get said was that we were all going to wear white sweaters or white sweatshirts and white sweatpants and then like have magic markers and we just draw over each other.

637
00:35:45,117 --> 00:35:47,258
[SPEAKER_19]: We're actually, we're actually, I think we do that.

638
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:50,158
[SPEAKER_19]: We need to do like actual, you know, make like fake uniforms or something.

639
00:35:50,238 --> 00:35:53,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we would either, if we all walked around in white shirts...

640
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:02,343
[SPEAKER_06]: If we all walked around in white shirts and white pants, these people would either think A, we're doing Battle Royale, or B, we're the next Heaven's Gate.

641
00:36:02,963 --> 00:36:06,925
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it that was on Loki's old sig?

642
00:36:07,085 --> 00:36:08,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Drink the Kool-Aid and follow the comet?

643
00:36:09,766 --> 00:36:10,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Dot, dot, dot.

644
00:36:11,527 --> 00:36:18,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, though, we should go back to Q's R. Hey, Rob?

645
00:36:19,271 --> 00:36:19,752
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob?

646
00:36:20,132 --> 00:36:20,432
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

647
00:36:21,687 --> 00:36:22,888
[SPEAKER_18]: Can I ask you guys a question?

648
00:36:22,908 --> 00:36:23,148
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

649
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:24,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, okay.

650
00:36:25,229 --> 00:36:26,931
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you guys all like your presents?

651
00:36:27,391 --> 00:36:27,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

652
00:36:28,792 --> 00:36:29,152
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

653
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:31,234
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, Rob and I are rappin' cool.

654
00:36:31,674 --> 00:36:36,837
[SPEAKER_03]: We got, Angel brought us a Parappa toy that I guess used to be at McDonald's at one point.

655
00:36:37,218 --> 00:36:40,200
[SPEAKER_03]: And you, it's a little keychain that you pull down and it bounces up and down.

656
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:40,680
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cute.

657
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,461
[SPEAKER_19]: And he's rappin' cool.

658
00:36:41,681 --> 00:36:45,583
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have like a guacamole del taco inspired keychain.

659
00:36:46,144 --> 00:36:47,104
[SPEAKER_18]: He said pull down.

660
00:36:47,124 --> 00:36:48,185
[SPEAKER_18]: Should I be afraid yet?

661
00:36:48,966 --> 00:36:50,647
[SPEAKER_18]: I have Pocari Sweat.

662
00:36:51,901 --> 00:36:52,903
[SPEAKER_18]: Angel Rules!

663
00:36:53,143 --> 00:36:53,383
[SPEAKER_18]: Again.

664
00:37:12,352 --> 00:37:14,233
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do songs that suck.

665
00:37:14,253 --> 00:37:15,694
[SPEAKER_03]: No, don't pick them from there.

666
00:37:15,774 --> 00:37:16,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Do this.

667
00:37:16,134 --> 00:37:17,635
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want songs that suck, go to this directory.

668
00:37:17,675 --> 00:37:18,816
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I want that song.

669
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:19,236
[SPEAKER_03]: You do want that?

670
00:37:19,256 --> 00:37:20,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we're not going to do songs that suck.

671
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:20,978
[SPEAKER_03]: This one?

672
00:37:21,118 --> 00:37:21,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

673
00:37:22,118 --> 00:37:22,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

674
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:24,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

675
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:29,183
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back in a little bit and we're going to talk about Bomani News.

676
00:37:29,263 --> 00:37:29,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

677
00:37:29,823 --> 00:37:31,965
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll do the FUs of the Week, Cage Match, Match Game.

678
00:37:31,985 --> 00:37:32,665
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all coming up.

679
00:37:33,245 --> 00:37:33,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for listening.

680
00:37:48,325 --> 00:37:48,770
Thank you.

681
00:40:09,626 --> 00:40:10,933
Thanks for watching!

682
00:41:03,499 --> 00:41:04,969
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.com

683
00:41:47,284 --> 00:41:48,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

684
00:43:27,631 --> 00:43:31,714
[SPEAKER_14]: From StepSquad to OrangeLabs, this DDR sucks!

685
00:43:31,834 --> 00:43:44,282
[SPEAKER_14]: Holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla.

686
00:43:56,992 --> 00:43:58,213
[SPEAKER_18]: Angel's got the proof.

687
00:43:59,955 --> 00:44:01,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you have photographic proof.

688
00:44:02,298 --> 00:44:05,161
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, hi, what were we going to talk about when we come back?

689
00:44:05,221 --> 00:44:07,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, news, Loki, give us news.

690
00:44:07,543 --> 00:44:08,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold it first.

691
00:44:08,585 --> 00:44:08,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob?

692
00:44:09,265 --> 00:44:09,566
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

693
00:44:09,726 --> 00:44:14,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Photographic proof will be up on www.uncluetomind.tk tomorrow.

694
00:44:14,831 --> 00:44:15,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray.

695
00:44:17,543 --> 00:44:25,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, anyways, with actual news for once, because we've been lacking for quite a while.

696
00:44:25,366 --> 00:44:26,466
[SPEAKER_03]: You big dirty liar!

697
00:44:27,286 --> 00:44:27,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up!

698
00:44:28,987 --> 00:44:39,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, we're going to start talking about, first thing of course is going to be Max 2, the release is coming out in a couple weeks actually, for the home versions, and I've already got it on order, so that's cool.

699
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:45,772
[SPEAKER_08]: But what's awesome is it's going to come with yet another VRare, and what's cool is I think this is going to be a hint at some of the stuff that we're going to see

700
00:44:46,472 --> 00:44:50,376
[SPEAKER_08]: as hidden songs in Max 2 and also as stuff that's going to be DDR Extreme 2.

701
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,978
[SPEAKER_08]: So, let's go down the list here.

702
00:44:53,258 --> 00:44:53,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

703
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:55,280
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not what I wanted.

704
00:44:56,141 --> 00:44:56,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, hold on.

705
00:44:57,262 --> 00:45:00,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

706
00:45:00,305 --> 00:45:01,065
[SPEAKER_03]: La la la.

707
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:01,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops.

708
00:45:01,586 --> 00:45:04,628
[SPEAKER_08]: And let's see here.

709
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:05,870
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.

710
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:08,152
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one that we were just looking at.

711
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:08,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Do do.

712
00:45:09,622 --> 00:45:10,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, way to go.

713
00:45:10,863 --> 00:45:11,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

714
00:45:11,403 --> 00:45:11,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

715
00:45:12,303 --> 00:45:13,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the songs that will be in there.

716
00:45:14,104 --> 00:45:21,848
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got some, it looks like the Max 2 for the home version is going to be the System SF remix of the whole, you know, series.

717
00:45:22,168 --> 00:45:27,430
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got, first, a brand new song by them, Feelings Won't Fade Extended Trans Mix, that's going to be on the V-Rare CD.

718
00:45:27,731 --> 00:45:32,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus three songs that are going to be hidden within Max that are going to be long versions of those songs.

719
00:45:32,413 --> 00:45:37,075
[SPEAKER_08]: We've also got Kind Lady, the Future Trans Mix, Midnight Blades, the System SF Mix, and

720
00:45:37,475 --> 00:45:46,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Glacial, which is the brand new Ryu Kosuka song, and an I Feel New Age Hope mix, which is also by System SF.

721
00:45:47,103 --> 00:45:52,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Because everyone got a big fat Woody over Drop the Bomb System SF mix, now it's like, oh, let's let the dude remix everything.

722
00:45:54,266 --> 00:45:54,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah?

723
00:45:56,068 --> 00:45:56,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty much.

724
00:45:56,809 --> 00:45:58,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much, I think I summed it up.

725
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:04,076
[SPEAKER_08]: But these songs right here, I'm predicting it here, you're going to see those all as hidden songs in Max 2.

726
00:46:04,196 --> 00:46:05,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are all going to be hidden songs in there.

727
00:46:06,198 --> 00:46:10,062
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're also going to be probably in, um... Let's see.

728
00:46:12,985 --> 00:46:14,327
[SPEAKER_08]: They're also going to be, uh...

729
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:19,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I flashed Jamie.

730
00:46:20,935 --> 00:46:25,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, there are also going to be new songs for probably the U.S.

731
00:46:25,897 --> 00:46:32,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Macs, too, and also going to be in, obviously, DDR Extreme, too.

732
00:46:32,799 --> 00:46:37,621
[SPEAKER_08]: So look for those, and we'll probably have MP3s as well as Bomani, so have MP3s.

733
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:42,482
[SPEAKER_08]: They quote six hours after the game comes out, they will have MP3s up on their site, so look for them.

734
00:46:42,802 --> 00:46:43,783
[SPEAKER_08]: They should have the MP3s there.

735
00:46:44,884 --> 00:46:52,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Now also, on top of that, since we're... Actually, I hate to cut you off, but you know, when Max USA came out, we actually went live and played Max USA on air.

736
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,002
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do the same thing for Max 2.

737
00:46:54,904 --> 00:47:02,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and let's see now, we've also got, since we were talking about that, more info on Max 2.

738
00:47:02,788 --> 00:47:06,349
[SPEAKER_08]: They've announced some of the playlist, or some of the song lists that's going to be there.

739
00:47:06,629 --> 00:47:17,834
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be a lot of, pretty much everything has come back from the arcade version of Max 2, except A Minute, let me see, I believe it's A Minute, The Whistle Song,

740
00:47:20,354 --> 00:47:20,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, shit.

741
00:47:20,834 --> 00:47:22,254
[SPEAKER_08]: There's like four songs that they were cut.

742
00:47:22,314 --> 00:47:24,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, so those will not be back.

743
00:47:24,795 --> 00:47:29,156
[SPEAKER_08]: There's rumors that they're going to be just, you know, unlocks, but I don't know.

744
00:47:29,276 --> 00:47:35,157
[SPEAKER_08]: There's another picture that they said that they saw a minute in it for the home version, so it's possible it's an unlock.

745
00:47:35,677 --> 00:47:37,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, on top of that, you're going to have some of the older songs.

746
00:47:37,518 --> 00:47:42,539
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to have Kind Lady and So In Love in there, plus, you know, Dynamite Rave and all the old, pretty much all the third mix stuff.

747
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:43,699
[SPEAKER_03]: All the barfy katas.

748
00:47:43,879 --> 00:47:45,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, all those that were in there before.

749
00:47:45,819 --> 00:47:49,000
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's going to be some DDR Extreme preview tracks in there.

750
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, Crash, Hooray

751
00:48:12,649 --> 00:48:19,054
[SPEAKER_08]: On top of that, there's going to be Oni modes as well, and the ability to make your own custom Oni modes.

752
00:48:19,874 --> 00:48:20,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, neat.

753
00:48:20,635 --> 00:48:22,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Custom Onis, that'll be kind of cool.

754
00:48:23,957 --> 00:48:24,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop it!

755
00:48:25,118 --> 00:48:29,441
[SPEAKER_08]: The fuck are you doing, this stupid hedgehog flying over my damn head?

756
00:48:29,962 --> 00:48:31,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Or weasel, or whatever the fuck that is.

757
00:48:33,885 --> 00:48:37,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, so that's what's coming up, we'll have that.

758
00:48:38,008 --> 00:48:38,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

759
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:43,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, aside from all that, I mean it.

760
00:48:43,724 --> 00:48:44,824
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to rip that thing in half.

761
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:47,645
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

762
00:48:47,725 --> 00:48:48,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I the Loki in the middle?

763
00:48:48,845 --> 00:48:50,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I the Loki in the middle?

764
00:48:50,286 --> 00:48:52,146
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, you're the Loki in the middle.

765
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:56,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, anyways, so now, let's get to some other news other than that.

766
00:48:56,028 --> 00:48:57,968
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll cover Dancing Stage Megamix in just a second.

767
00:48:58,408 --> 00:49:01,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Really quickly here, moving along, we've got Poppin' Music 9 info.

768
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:19,999
[SPEAKER_08]: and this is kinda cool, they were talking about, it sounds like it's almost like Bishibashi here, now they have Poppin' Music 9 Imallu, which is, I guess it's gonna be a version of Poppin' Music 9, it's kinda like the powered up versions of Guitar Freaks, where it has, you know, the e-cards that are gonna go in there, you know, the magnetic cards that store all your data,

769
00:49:20,759 --> 00:49:22,800
[SPEAKER_08]: and you're going to have a lot of different modes in there.

770
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:31,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Like for instance, you can like swap, I guess you can earn items in this game with the scores that you get to buy stuff and you can send it to each other.

771
00:49:31,764 --> 00:49:34,986
[SPEAKER_08]: They have, well let's see, let's get to the actual cool stuff.

772
00:49:35,246 --> 00:49:40,729
[SPEAKER_08]: They've got a mini game in it that's called Bomani that's actually like Beatmania because there's a turntable

773
00:49:41,609 --> 00:49:42,449
[SPEAKER_08]: on this machine.

774
00:49:42,489 --> 00:49:44,150
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a turntable and two keys.

775
00:49:45,311 --> 00:49:46,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is kind of weird.

776
00:49:46,231 --> 00:49:47,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.

777
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:53,954
[SPEAKER_08]: They've got another game called Puka Puka, which is in... Sounds dirty.

778
00:49:55,014 --> 00:49:59,856
[SPEAKER_08]: This game, you use the buttons to avoid objects while trying to reach the good, whatever the fuck that means.

779
00:50:00,976 --> 00:50:03,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, target practice, you know, something like that.

780
00:50:03,457 --> 00:50:04,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Table tennis.

781
00:50:04,298 --> 00:50:06,238
[SPEAKER_08]: It pretty much sounds like bishy-boshy, you know.

782
00:50:06,659 --> 00:50:09,219
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're going to have some songs, new songs.

783
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:10,080
[SPEAKER_08]: But now...

784
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:21,828
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even want to know what's going on behind me, okay?

785
00:50:22,188 --> 00:50:26,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, I see flashes of light and a stupid weasel thing flying around.

786
00:50:27,632 --> 00:50:30,634
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to know what you guys are taking pictures of.

787
00:50:31,415 --> 00:50:32,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially since it's around my ass.

788
00:50:33,877 --> 00:50:37,898
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really afraid to see what that stupid thing is doing to my ass, okay?

789
00:50:38,398 --> 00:50:40,999
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyways, now, Guitar Freak.

790
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:47,320
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got a lot of Transplant songs from Poppin' Music that are going to be in it, plus some pretty cool shit.

791
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:53,462
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got Apple and Honey from Poppin' Music that's going to be in there, C777 from Poppin' Music, Impulse of Blue.

792
00:50:53,822 --> 00:50:57,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that sounds like Blue Impulse, but you know, I don't know, it's probably a different song.

793
00:50:58,223 --> 00:50:58,843
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a Loser.

794
00:51:00,664 --> 00:51:03,726
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got the extra stage as being Kaleidoscope by Jimmy Weck.

795
00:51:04,006 --> 00:51:07,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, you might remember, he is the guy that did Across the Nightmare.

796
00:51:07,509 --> 00:51:13,013
[SPEAKER_08]: We've also got the encore stage from Dance Maniacs, Mad Blast by The Infection, which is really awesome.

797
00:51:14,734 --> 00:51:17,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, bonus tracks, we're going to have some long version songs.

798
00:51:17,496 --> 00:51:22,100
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Dreams in the Night, Twinkle Star, Cries in the Wilderness, and...

799
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:23,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Party Hard by Andrew W.K.

800
00:51:41,211 --> 00:51:43,632
[SPEAKER_08]: They've also got Show Business by ACDC.

801
00:51:43,852 --> 00:51:44,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, dear God.

802
00:51:47,714 --> 00:51:48,734
[SPEAKER_08]: And Mr. Children.

803
00:51:48,774 --> 00:51:50,035
[SPEAKER_08]: I recognize Mr. Children.

804
00:51:50,375 --> 00:51:53,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Crossroads by Mr. Children, I think.

805
00:51:54,317 --> 00:51:56,137
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's some other J-Rock stuff in there, too.

806
00:51:56,237 --> 00:51:59,419
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know J-Rock, so, I mean, I don't know.

807
00:51:59,499 --> 00:52:00,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at the list.

808
00:52:04,841 --> 00:52:06,802
[SPEAKER_19]: Yida Hitomi is the one who did My Sweet Darling.

809
00:52:09,713 --> 00:52:09,913
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

810
00:52:10,154 --> 00:52:11,676
[SPEAKER_03]: And she has a song called Adante.

811
00:52:12,216 --> 00:52:14,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, now that's all out of the way.

812
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:17,142
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all about Guitar Freaks 9th and Drum Mania 8th.

813
00:52:17,663 --> 00:52:23,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so now we're going to have... Wow, I'm so moist in anticipation of Guitar Freaks 9th, not...

814
00:52:26,963 --> 00:52:27,683
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just gross.

815
00:52:28,024 --> 00:52:33,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, now, finally, with the list of the songs, the game will probably never play because it's in Europe.

816
00:52:33,887 --> 00:52:34,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking Europeans.

817
00:52:35,407 --> 00:52:37,368
[SPEAKER_08]: They've got a brand new Dancing Stage Megamix.

818
00:52:37,388 --> 00:52:41,170
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be basically equivalent to R-Max 2 or whatever.

819
00:52:41,531 --> 00:52:44,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, it's going to have seven licensed songs.

820
00:52:44,612 --> 00:52:46,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Stealing Beats by Kid Galahad.

821
00:52:46,133 --> 00:52:46,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Never heard of it.

822
00:52:46,993 --> 00:52:48,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Love at First Sight by Kylie Minogue.

823
00:52:48,734 --> 00:52:49,134
[SPEAKER_03]: I have that.

824
00:52:49,175 --> 00:52:49,595
[SPEAKER_03]: We can play it.

825
00:52:50,195 --> 00:52:51,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Love Cats by The Cure.

826
00:52:52,216 --> 00:52:56,518
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so awesome that The Cure gets into DDR and it's a shitty song.

827
00:52:57,219 --> 00:53:00,341
[SPEAKER_08]: When You Look At Me by Christina Milan, whatever that is.

828
00:53:00,741 --> 00:53:01,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, whatever.

829
00:53:01,321 --> 00:53:06,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Shake Your Body by Shy FX and T-Power featuring DJ Ranma.

830
00:53:06,164 --> 00:53:06,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

831
00:53:07,224 --> 00:53:09,045
[SPEAKER_08]: One Step Closer by S. John Jay.

832
00:53:09,065 --> 00:53:09,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, whatever.

833
00:53:09,946 --> 00:53:11,887
[SPEAKER_08]: And A Little Less Conversation, Elvis vs. JX.

834
00:53:11,907 --> 00:53:15,289
[SPEAKER_02]: A little less conversation, a little, a little, a little.

835
00:53:15,369 --> 00:53:16,529
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the fucking words.

836
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:17,810
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to make them up.

837
00:53:19,751 --> 00:53:24,173
[SPEAKER_08]: They're pretty much going to have the same shit we're going to have on our DDR Max 2.

838
00:53:24,213 --> 00:53:31,236
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be all the Konami originals, plus the preview songs from DDR Extreme.

839
00:53:32,037 --> 00:53:32,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Same shit there.

840
00:53:33,697 --> 00:53:35,098
[SPEAKER_08]: But here's where the funny part is.

841
00:53:35,318 --> 00:53:36,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Their unlock system.

842
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:40,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Their unlock system is a joke.

843
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it like you just play a song?

844
00:53:42,041 --> 00:53:43,201
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't even have to pass it?

845
00:53:43,241 --> 00:53:44,142
[SPEAKER_03]: You just play it and then...

846
00:53:45,149 --> 00:53:45,769
[SPEAKER_08]: You can unlock.

847
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:46,550
[SPEAKER_08]: No, seriously.

848
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:48,510
[SPEAKER_08]: The first unlock is after one song.

849
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:53,672
[SPEAKER_08]: It unlocks... Let me pull this up because it's really ridiculous.

850
00:53:54,992 --> 00:53:56,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't it Endless Mode or something that was after one song?

851
00:53:56,873 --> 00:53:57,953
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's after quite a few.

852
00:53:59,634 --> 00:54:01,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Records Mode after one.

853
00:54:01,755 --> 00:54:02,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoop-a-dee-doo!

854
00:54:02,995 --> 00:54:07,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously it's going to have to be after one because you're going to have to play a song in order to have a record for it.

855
00:54:08,757 --> 00:54:09,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see here.

856
00:54:10,678 --> 00:54:12,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, here we go.

857
00:54:13,059 --> 00:54:17,121
[SPEAKER_08]: After three points, which is basically three unlocks, you get training mode.

858
00:54:17,521 --> 00:54:20,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Six points, you get edit mode.

859
00:54:20,643 --> 00:54:23,684
[SPEAKER_08]: You get ten points and pass 70 songs.

860
00:54:24,965 --> 00:54:29,267
[SPEAKER_08]: You get max 300, 15 points, and 100 songs, so you get endless mode.

861
00:54:29,947 --> 00:54:30,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoop-a-dee-doo.

862
00:54:34,471 --> 00:54:35,131
[SPEAKER_03]: What a shit.

863
00:54:35,331 --> 00:54:36,011
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, that's it.

864
00:54:36,051 --> 00:54:36,811
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all the news I have.

865
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:38,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay, that was wonderful.

866
00:54:39,012 --> 00:54:41,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and if the DDR Extreme OST came out, the non-stop suck ass.

867
00:54:41,352 --> 00:54:41,632
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

868
00:54:42,532 --> 00:54:43,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Why does the non-stop suck ass?

869
00:54:43,653 --> 00:54:44,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they didn't remix shit.

870
00:54:45,053 --> 00:54:46,133
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't remix anything.

871
00:54:49,994 --> 00:54:50,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

872
00:54:50,994 --> 00:54:52,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, next up on the show.

873
00:54:54,014 --> 00:54:54,755
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn, you guys.

874
00:54:54,795 --> 00:54:55,475
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a surprise.

875
00:54:55,895 --> 00:54:56,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

876
00:54:56,995 --> 00:55:00,175
[SPEAKER_03]: What we're going to do, we're going to do the FUs of the week.

877
00:55:00,596 --> 00:55:02,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you done playing your stupid ferret?

878
00:55:02,176 --> 00:55:02,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me the ferret.

879
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:03,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me the ferret.

880
00:55:04,953 --> 00:55:10,274
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, seriously, I'm going to make you all go outside and we'll just, we'll finish the show.

881
00:55:12,435 --> 00:55:12,695
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey!

882
00:55:13,115 --> 00:55:13,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

883
00:55:13,715 --> 00:55:15,876
[SPEAKER_18]: Was that Skyvis voice of the game?

884
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:17,036
[SPEAKER_18]: Skyvis voice of the game.

885
00:55:17,156 --> 00:55:17,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Children.

886
00:55:17,536 --> 00:55:18,216
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all I got to say.

887
00:55:18,256 --> 00:55:18,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

888
00:55:18,917 --> 00:55:19,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

889
00:55:19,697 --> 00:55:22,678
[SPEAKER_03]: FUs of the week are coming back and I don't have to think very hard about what mine's going to be.

890
00:55:23,738 --> 00:55:25,438
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah, thank you.

891
00:55:25,698 --> 00:55:27,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Maren, does someone want time out?

892
00:55:27,339 --> 00:55:28,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys need time out?

893
00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:28,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

894
00:55:30,796 --> 00:55:31,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I quit.

895
00:55:32,056 --> 00:55:33,597
[SPEAKER_12]: I quit.

896
00:55:33,898 --> 00:55:35,879
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hiring Marin to come here and be your mother.

897
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:38,501
[SPEAKER_03]: She left.

898
00:55:38,561 --> 00:55:39,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, she needs to be here, though.

899
00:55:39,882 --> 00:55:44,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, what we're going to do, we're going to do the F... Knock, knock, knocking on the door.

900
00:55:45,125 --> 00:55:48,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we're going to do the FDs of the week, so go ahead and start sending those to me.

901
00:55:48,908 --> 00:55:49,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in the chat room.

902
00:55:50,148 --> 00:55:51,629
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm going to turn around this car right now.

903
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:52,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Send those to me.

904
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:53,491
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in the chat room.

905

[SPEAKER_03]: The Money Goes in the Dark!

929
00:59:16,345 --> 00:59:19,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about what your FUs of the week are now before the microphone gets to you.

930
00:59:19,568 --> 00:59:19,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

931
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:23,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Why am I still trying to pull up the TerraMix of Schlagwerk?

932
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:24,513
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not know.

933
00:59:24,954 --> 00:59:30,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's start it off with the only woman who can start this off, the FUs of the week.

934
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:37,346
[SPEAKER_19]: I had aches at one moment, now it's all gone.

935
00:59:48,647 --> 00:59:53,388
[SPEAKER_19]: I have to say that the first one would definitely go toward my state of unemployment, not having money.

936
00:59:54,069 --> 00:59:57,230
[SPEAKER_19]: But I will know within this week if I have another job, which I likely will.

937
00:59:57,250 --> 00:59:58,390
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's great for me.

938
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:00,851
[SPEAKER_19]: And the other one goes toward stupid fucks on the road.

939
01:00:01,411 --> 01:00:02,492
[SPEAKER_19]: I hate them and I want them to die.

940
01:00:02,512 --> 01:00:03,992
[SPEAKER_19]: Not taking me with them.

941
01:00:07,751 --> 01:00:11,593
[SPEAKER_19]: I want there to be the Battle Royale of the Rhodes with me as the victor.

942
01:00:12,173 --> 01:00:14,735
[SPEAKER_19]: And them all lying in bloody burn.

943
01:00:14,835 --> 01:00:15,515
[SPEAKER_19]: Ooh, a tank.

944
01:00:16,055 --> 01:00:16,676
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, that's right.

945
01:00:16,736 --> 01:00:17,456
[SPEAKER_19]: I need a tank.

946
01:00:18,337 --> 01:00:19,017
[SPEAKER_19]: Somebody give me a tank.

947
01:00:19,417 --> 01:00:24,900
[SPEAKER_19]: And my other view goes toward my birthday is on the 19th, okay?

948
01:00:25,761 --> 01:00:29,803
[SPEAKER_19]: And I can't go do my normal thing that I do because I don't have money.

949
01:00:29,923 --> 01:00:31,283
[SPEAKER_19]: Someone buy me the Battle Royale novel.

950
01:00:31,303 --> 01:00:31,624
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

951
01:00:33,745 --> 01:00:34,705
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, moving on.

952
01:00:34,765 --> 01:00:36,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear from Loki.

953
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:42,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn it, I missed, uh, I, like, forgot a lot of them.

954
01:00:42,137 --> 01:00:43,618
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right.

955
01:00:43,638 --> 01:00:50,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, uh, to start it off, um, big F you to the stupid bitch that was sitting next to us.

956
01:00:50,543 --> 01:00:54,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, big bitch that was sitting next to us at the movie theater yesterday.

957
01:00:54,746 --> 01:00:59,330
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, there was plenty of other seats, but no, your fat ass had to move in front of us before the show.

958
01:00:59,470 --> 01:01:00,991
[SPEAKER_08]: But you did before the show!

959
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:03,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Then her stupid, ugly kid sat next to me, too.

960
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:04,714
[SPEAKER_08]: And then her fucking...

961
01:01:05,234 --> 01:01:15,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Then after all that, she ended up having her cell phone on during the movie and then it rang and she answered it and started talking and just wouldn't fucking shut up, so I hate her and I wish she'd die.

962
01:01:17,242 --> 01:01:23,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Big F you also to the stupid bastards that drive cars in parking lots.

963
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:27,409
[SPEAKER_08]: When I'm trying to back out, don't fucking park your car behind mine.

964
01:01:27,769 --> 01:01:31,112
[SPEAKER_08]: The next time you do that, I'm going to back up at full speed and kill you.

965
01:01:32,352 --> 01:01:32,753
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

966
01:01:32,953 --> 01:01:33,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Simple as that.

967
01:01:33,513 --> 01:01:36,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially if you're just a pedestrian standing there, that's even worse.

968
01:01:36,556 --> 01:01:38,497
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll make it nice and easy for me to run over you.

969
01:01:39,298 --> 01:01:40,298
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, yeah.

970
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:43,060
[SPEAKER_08]: So don't get in my way in parking lots.

971
01:01:43,901 --> 01:01:45,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop distracting me with all this pencil crap!

972
01:01:47,684 --> 01:01:48,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously!

973
01:01:48,885 --> 01:01:49,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you done?

974
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:50,606
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not done!

975
01:01:50,806 --> 01:01:51,887
[SPEAKER_08]: He bothered me!

976
01:01:54,449 --> 01:01:54,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you done now?

977
01:01:56,711 --> 01:01:56,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

978
01:01:58,922 --> 01:02:00,444
[SPEAKER_08]: For now, because I can't remember them.

979
01:02:00,664 --> 01:02:01,245
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll come back.

980
01:02:01,485 --> 01:02:01,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.

981
01:02:02,226 --> 01:02:04,128
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a few FUs of the week I'd like to give out.

982
01:02:04,588 --> 01:02:07,031
[SPEAKER_03]: My first FU goes to Daylight Savings Time.

983
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:07,732
[SPEAKER_08]: One more.

984
01:02:08,993 --> 01:02:09,814
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's my turn.

985
01:02:09,834 --> 01:02:10,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

986
01:02:10,755 --> 01:02:11,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

987
01:02:11,135 --> 01:02:11,636
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go back.

988
01:02:11,656 --> 01:02:12,036
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go back.

989
01:02:12,316 --> 01:02:14,158
[SPEAKER_03]: My first FU goes to Daylight Savings Time.

990
01:02:14,198 --> 01:02:14,799
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck?

991
01:02:15,099 --> 01:02:16,281
[SPEAKER_03]: An hour of sleep lost?

992
01:02:16,721 --> 01:02:20,563
[SPEAKER_03]: because somebody decided we need more suns so the children can play outdoors more.

993
01:02:20,583 --> 01:02:20,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck that.

994
01:02:21,163 --> 01:02:22,764
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not safe to play outdoors more.

995
01:02:22,784 --> 01:02:26,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, actually it's because the year isn't exactly 365 days.

996
01:02:27,005 --> 01:02:29,526
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's an actual, you know... Wait, no, that's leap years.

997
01:02:29,566 --> 01:02:29,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Never mind.

998
01:02:29,926 --> 01:02:30,247
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

999
01:02:30,467 --> 01:02:31,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't give a shit.

1000
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:32,628
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks my balls.

1001
01:02:32,728 --> 01:02:34,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Not every country celebrates it.

1002
01:02:34,168 --> 01:02:35,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do we have to?

1003
01:02:36,009 --> 01:02:37,229
[SPEAKER_03]: I lost an hour of sleep.

1004
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:38,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Lick me.

1005
01:02:39,730 --> 01:02:40,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Arizona rules.

1006
01:02:40,891 --> 01:02:42,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1007
01:02:42,932 --> 01:02:43,332
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?

1008
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:48,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Arizona doesn't celebrate Martin Luther King Jr.

1009
01:02:48,158 --> 01:02:48,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Day either.

1010
01:02:48,458 --> 01:02:49,579
[SPEAKER_03]: They're kind of fucked up.

1011
01:02:51,241 --> 01:02:52,242
[SPEAKER_03]: What else am I trying to think of?

1012
01:02:52,622 --> 01:02:53,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there was something else.

1013
01:02:55,125 --> 01:02:57,868
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to having a crush and not knowing what to do with it.

1014
01:02:58,148 --> 01:02:58,649
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate that.

1015
01:02:59,189 --> 01:03:00,030
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to traffic.

1016
01:03:00,791 --> 01:03:01,512
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate cars.

1017
01:03:03,454 --> 01:03:03,814
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to...

1018
01:03:08,195 --> 01:03:09,758
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to zero, he's looking at me funny.

1019
01:03:11,221 --> 01:03:11,742
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

1020
01:03:12,964 --> 01:03:14,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't think of anything else.

1021
01:03:14,227 --> 01:03:15,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, back to Loki.

1022
01:03:17,114 --> 01:03:22,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, this is gonna be an F you to pretty much everyone that was not competing in DDR Idol, but the judges for DDR Idol.

1023
01:03:23,298 --> 01:03:24,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen, you stupid bastards!

1024
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:27,340
[SPEAKER_08]: I worked hours on the fucking audio setup!

1025
01:03:27,601 --> 01:03:30,943
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason you can't hear yourselves in the mic is because you're whispering into the fucking mic!

1026
01:03:31,243 --> 01:03:32,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk loudly!

1027
01:03:32,364 --> 01:03:34,265
[SPEAKER_07]: I did sound checks so you can hear people.

1028
01:03:34,485 --> 01:03:37,026
[SPEAKER_07]: You're like, I can't hear myself because I'm talking really quietly.

1029
01:03:37,527 --> 01:03:38,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Turn it up!

1030
01:03:38,267 --> 01:03:38,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Turn it up!

1031
01:03:39,008 --> 01:03:40,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Speak louder, you stupid bastard!

1032
01:03:42,537 --> 01:03:45,019
[SPEAKER_08]: That news, the guy that played Simon, you really sucked.

1033
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:46,180
[SPEAKER_08]: You pussed out, man.

1034
01:03:47,401 --> 01:03:48,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I like that guy.

1035
01:03:48,302 --> 01:03:48,742
[SPEAKER_08]: He was great.

1036
01:03:48,762 --> 01:03:49,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, he pussed out, man.

1037
01:03:49,763 --> 01:03:54,067
[SPEAKER_19]: He was good, but had failure, not had bronchitis.

1038
01:03:54,107 --> 01:03:54,907
[SPEAKER_08]: He pussed out.

1039
01:03:55,188 --> 01:03:56,309
[SPEAKER_08]: I could have been a better Simon.

1040
01:03:56,689 --> 01:03:57,089
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

1041
01:03:57,129 --> 01:03:59,071
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have hated everyone, so I guess I couldn't have done that.

1042
01:03:59,111 --> 01:04:02,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there might be something involving American Idol on this station in the future.

1043
01:04:02,594 --> 01:04:03,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

1044
01:04:03,194 --> 01:04:04,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Ideas are going around.

1045
01:04:04,295 --> 01:04:07,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, so F you tonight, and F you for eBay for having me take it.

1046
01:04:11,189 --> 01:04:11,650
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm done.

1047
01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:13,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on.

1048
01:04:13,191 --> 01:04:14,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go around the room.

1049
01:04:14,332 --> 01:04:15,453
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll start with what?

1050
01:04:16,094 --> 01:04:16,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start with Tal.

1051
01:04:16,694 --> 01:04:17,115
[SPEAKER_03]: He's over here.

1052
01:04:17,155 --> 01:04:18,036
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go this way.

1053
01:04:18,476 --> 01:04:19,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Tal, kick it off.

1054
01:04:20,138 --> 01:04:20,618
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?

1055
01:04:21,239 --> 01:04:24,942
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to give a nice fuck you to, oh, everybody who's ever gone to Scandia.

1056
01:04:26,003 --> 01:04:27,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Except for, you know, my friends.

1057
01:04:27,124 --> 01:04:28,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're intelligent people.

1058
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:30,127
[SPEAKER_02]: We know what English is.

1059
01:04:30,347 --> 01:04:30,948
[SPEAKER_02]: We speak it.

1060
01:04:31,048 --> 01:04:31,909
[SPEAKER_02]: We know how to read it.

1061
01:04:32,249 --> 01:04:34,431
[SPEAKER_02]: We know what it means to be able to follow instructions.

1062
01:04:35,011 --> 01:04:35,292
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?

1063
01:04:37,953 --> 01:04:40,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, this is the best background ever.

1064
01:04:41,075 --> 01:04:47,417
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to give a... Dude, there's some seriously retarded people out there.

1065
01:04:47,497 --> 01:04:48,558
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so scary.

1066
01:04:48,598 --> 01:04:58,962
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to know just how many people, when we came back after the tournament, while I was playing 2DX, how many people came up with that token machine and put money in it when it said, please use another changer.

1067
01:04:59,522 --> 01:05:02,003
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, you know... People are stupid and can't read.

1068
01:05:03,147 --> 01:05:09,933
[SPEAKER_19]: and one person was like, oh my god, the machine stopped working and I stopped in my game and said, read the sign.

1069
01:05:11,403 --> 01:05:14,045
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what area Scandia is located at, right?

1070
01:05:14,065 --> 01:05:16,006
[SPEAKER_09]: You know how many people are illiterate there?

1071
01:05:16,386 --> 01:05:19,068
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, but people are just as stupid who go to RVGL.

1072
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:23,351
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing that's made me want to go back and get my college degree and work in Scandia.

1073
01:05:23,371 --> 01:05:25,713
[SPEAKER_19]: At least there are more retards at RVGL than at Scandia.

1074
01:05:26,413 --> 01:05:27,554
[SPEAKER_02]: No, dude, seriously.

1075
01:05:28,054 --> 01:05:32,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Until you work there, there are people, there are retards that work at RVGL.

1076
01:05:32,457 --> 01:05:37,121
[SPEAKER_19]: There's retards at Scandia, and then there's just people who expect other people to do it for them at RVGL.

1077
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:37,921
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, it's like this.

1078
01:05:38,081 --> 01:05:39,963
[SPEAKER_09]: People at Scandia don't have a choice, but people at RVGL do.

1079
01:05:40,883 --> 01:05:43,244
[SPEAKER_19]: That isn't even worse.

1080
01:05:43,324 --> 01:05:44,645
[SPEAKER_02]: It boggles the brain.

1081
01:05:45,065 --> 01:05:47,066
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, let's see, what else would I like to ask you?

1082
01:05:47,607 --> 01:05:48,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1083
01:05:49,207 --> 01:05:54,190
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to give a nice big fuck you to Gitaroo Man, because I don't have it, and I really, really want it.

1084
01:05:55,170 --> 01:06:02,374
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like... And, um... God, I had a whole list of them today, but I don't remember, so I'll come back.

1085
01:06:02,834 --> 01:06:03,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, no, I won't.

1086
01:06:03,655 --> 01:06:05,355
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll keep this, because I'm a mic whore.

1087
01:06:06,956 --> 01:06:07,416
[SPEAKER_02]: My turn.

1088
01:06:07,536 --> 01:06:07,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1089
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:07,977
Uh...

1090
01:06:11,283 --> 01:06:25,467
[SPEAKER_09]: My first lucky goes to being broke because I had to live off $20 this weekend because that's almost all I have left until I get more luck.

1091
01:06:25,788 --> 01:06:28,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you to expiring ATM cards.

1092
01:06:28,448 --> 01:06:29,709
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had no money this weekend.

1093
01:06:30,449 --> 01:06:34,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well... It's because it pays, yeah.

1094
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:34,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

1095
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:37,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, uh... Oh, yeah.

1096
01:06:37,271 --> 01:06:39,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well, anyway.

1097
01:06:39,192 --> 01:06:39,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Also...

1098
01:06:41,027 --> 01:06:44,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck you to bad grades, because it sucks.

1099
01:06:44,448 --> 01:06:49,370
[SPEAKER_13]: Shut up!

1100
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:53,431
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, fuck my bike, because it got another flat tire.

1101
01:06:53,951 --> 01:06:55,151
[SPEAKER_14]: You got a flat tire?

1102
01:06:55,292 --> 01:06:56,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, on my bike, yes.

1103
01:06:57,620 --> 01:06:57,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1104
01:06:58,701 --> 01:07:03,246
[SPEAKER_09]: And... And fuck the old GPAs for not having lights on them.

1105
01:07:03,506 --> 01:07:03,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Put one in.

1106
01:07:03,907 --> 01:07:04,768
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll put one in.

1107
01:07:05,548 --> 01:07:07,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I know about the afterburner, and I'm too cheap to get one.

1108
01:07:07,951 --> 01:07:11,054
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just use a bike light under my chin.

1109
01:07:12,876 --> 01:07:15,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'm Ryan for the show.

1110
01:07:17,041 --> 01:07:18,923
[SPEAKER_09]: I have, like, a light shield thing, but it sucks.

1111
01:07:22,176 --> 01:07:22,776
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a gadget.

1112
01:07:22,796 --> 01:07:31,280
[SPEAKER_09]: I have you go to Rob and Jamie for the free show, making retard noises during Daikonkai.

1113
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:40,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Next time you guys go in the middle of a great song like Daikonkai, just kill yourself first.

1114
01:07:40,484 --> 01:07:41,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, shut up.

1115
01:07:41,644 --> 01:07:42,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Anita's here.

1116
01:07:42,805 --> 01:07:43,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Anita.

1117
01:07:44,305 --> 01:07:44,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, next.

1118
01:07:49,541 --> 01:07:55,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck the judges for making me stop in the middle of my Guacamole Del Taco routine.

1119
01:07:55,464 --> 01:08:00,747
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like 95% of the way done just because I was like failing my song.

1120
01:08:00,947 --> 01:08:01,327
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1121
01:08:01,347 --> 01:08:01,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to cut you off.

1122
01:08:02,088 --> 01:08:02,988
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucking agree with that.

1123
01:08:03,008 --> 01:08:04,269
[SPEAKER_03]: You paid your money to be up there.

1124
01:08:04,329 --> 01:08:05,990
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter what other people think.

1125
01:08:06,030 --> 01:08:06,730
[SPEAKER_03]: You paid your money.

1126
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:07,730
[SPEAKER_03]: You should get to do your dance.

1127
01:08:08,031 --> 01:08:10,272
[SPEAKER_03]: The gong is a stupid idea and eat me.

1128
01:08:10,912 --> 01:08:11,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1129
01:08:13,554 --> 01:08:14,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I had a gong.

1130
01:08:16,843 --> 01:08:19,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Fucking single and a bunch of hoes.

1131
01:08:19,312 --> 01:08:21,822
[SPEAKER_10]: And I agree with the whole crush thing.

1132
01:08:24,497 --> 01:08:25,017
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a bitch.

1133
01:08:25,537 --> 01:08:27,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, no, I got a few fuckies, actually.

1134
01:08:28,078 --> 01:08:30,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, fuck you to the judges for stopping you.

1135
01:08:30,499 --> 01:08:32,280
[SPEAKER_06]: That pissed me off more than anything.

1136
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:35,401
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to get up and, like, just start hitting people, then I want to get sent home.

1137
01:08:35,801 --> 01:08:40,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, fuck you to losing my voice after doing Orange Lounge all weekend last week.

1138
01:08:40,662 --> 01:08:41,183
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't talk.

1139
01:08:41,203 --> 01:08:41,843
[SPEAKER_03]: You're my hero.

1140
01:08:41,963 --> 01:08:45,084
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't talk for, like, two days afterwards, but it was fun.

1141
01:08:46,484 --> 01:08:47,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Zero's a hero.

1142
01:08:48,505 --> 01:08:48,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Shush!

1143
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:51,366
[SPEAKER_06]: No, um, and, uh...

1144
01:08:51,986 --> 01:08:58,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, fuck you to the people who were making fun of the DDR Idol contestants because I really didn't see you guys get up there and do anything.

1145
01:08:58,950 --> 01:09:00,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's see you get some balls.

1146
01:09:01,171 --> 01:09:02,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, or something.

1147
01:09:04,613 --> 01:09:11,156
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, anyways, this is pointless, it's like microphone juggling.

1148
01:09:11,176 --> 01:09:14,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I've got to thank Lizzie for bailing me out earlier to save my life.

1149
01:09:15,619 --> 01:09:17,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, um, fuck...

1150
01:09:19,016 --> 01:09:26,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, fuck you to all those stupid bastards who pointed and laughed at me when I stumbled on a challenge that caused me to have a damn breakdown.

1151
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:35,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, fuck you to all the morons in Scandia, well, the, um, whatchacallit, the customer morons that aren't us.

1152
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:41,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're all fucking jackasses that need to just go live at RBGL for a month.

1153
01:09:42,008 --> 01:09:42,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

1154
01:09:44,142 --> 01:09:47,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, fuck you for being tired and fuck you for the other same time because I lost an hour.

1155
01:09:48,243 --> 01:09:51,324
[SPEAKER_06]: And fuck you to Battle Royale and here's the reason why.

1156
01:09:52,164 --> 01:09:54,065
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't see all the deaths.

1157
01:09:54,225 --> 01:09:58,226
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to see all of the however many 40 deaths or whatever.

1158
01:09:58,466 --> 01:10:00,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to see each and every one of you in detail.

1159
01:10:00,966 --> 01:10:02,046
[SPEAKER_06]: How everyone happened.

1160
01:10:02,287 --> 01:10:03,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them you just hear they died.

1161
01:10:04,654 --> 01:10:04,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh?

1162
01:10:05,214 --> 01:10:05,954
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I want to get it.

1163
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,255
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to get the script, too.

1164
01:10:07,595 --> 01:10:13,137
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyways, yeah, and fuck you to trying to get your computer networked, because it never seems to happen.

1165
01:10:13,337 --> 01:10:14,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they get that done yet?

1166
01:10:14,357 --> 01:10:15,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Networking the computers?

1167
01:10:15,298 --> 01:10:15,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck.

1168
01:10:15,418 --> 01:10:15,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'm done.

1169
01:10:15,958 --> 01:10:16,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Angel's turn, is it?

1170
01:10:28,584 --> 01:10:37,995
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, I'd like to say, fuck you to jet lag, because I haven't been able to... Hey, hey, my floor!

1171
01:10:38,375 --> 01:10:38,716
Thank you.

1172
01:10:39,056 --> 01:10:41,139
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, it got really quiet in here, how nice.

1173
01:10:43,627 --> 01:10:49,269
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, fuck you to jet lag, because I haven't been able to get used to the time since I got back on Thursday.

1174
01:10:49,649 --> 01:10:52,250
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't been getting any sleep.

1175
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:57,891
[SPEAKER_18]: Ask Rob, because he knows that I only got 25 minutes of sleep last night.

1176
01:10:57,931 --> 01:11:06,214
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, wait, that doesn't help, because Black Lab, myself, and Dark Tessia were playing 2DX all night long.

1177
01:11:06,254 --> 01:11:06,474
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway.

1178
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:14,563
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyways, yeah, fuck you to jetlag, and fuck you to airplane food, because it sucks.

1179
01:11:14,923 --> 01:11:16,864
[SPEAKER_18]: Not all the time, but this time it sucks.

1180
01:11:16,924 --> 01:11:17,484
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1181
01:11:17,604 --> 01:11:19,965
I'm gonna engage your fuck you to traffic jams.

1182
01:11:20,085 --> 01:11:25,768
[SPEAKER_05]: How the hell am I supposed to get from Sacto to Novato within 90 minutes if it's on a two-lane road, 35 miles per hour,

1183
01:11:37,737 --> 01:11:40,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Bumper to bumper.

1184
01:11:40,218 --> 01:11:41,239
[SPEAKER_26]: That's why we were late.

1185
01:11:42,459 --> 01:11:45,021
[SPEAKER_26]: Fuck you to Istanbul.

1186
01:11:45,081 --> 01:11:46,081
[SPEAKER_26]: Pussy ass Simon.

1187
01:11:46,241 --> 01:11:50,523
[SPEAKER_26]: All of the judges, number one, were gonging DT.

1188
01:11:51,364 --> 01:11:55,026
[SPEAKER_26]: Number two, Simon actually passed me.

1189
01:11:55,566 --> 01:11:58,267
[SPEAKER_05]: He just completely pussed out.

1190
01:12:02,066 --> 01:12:03,727
[SPEAKER_14]: And... I'm Sven.

1191
01:12:04,747 --> 01:12:06,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's move on.

1192
01:12:07,408 --> 01:12:07,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

1193
01:12:07,968 --> 01:12:10,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we have the chatroom FUs, so let's get to the chatroom FUs.

1194
01:12:10,769 --> 01:12:19,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we have... Justin wants to say, FU to Friday night, no one at Scandia, and there was this girl playing DDR, and I was playing with her, but she had no idea how to play.

1195
01:12:20,151 --> 01:12:22,853
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I try telling her, and she's like, well, I don't remember what she said.

1196
01:12:22,893 --> 01:12:24,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Something in Spanish, because she didn't even speak English.

1197
01:12:25,495 --> 01:12:31,919
[SPEAKER_03]: On a good note, I'm getting a free customized CD from LED Records, which is Judy Crystal, Maria Shore, Priscilla, and Rose's producer.

1198
01:12:32,419 --> 01:12:35,141
[SPEAKER_03]: And an FU to the troll lady I saw driving with missing teeth.

1199
01:12:38,423 --> 01:12:49,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Ness151 would like to say a big hearty FU to DDR Coralville for not giving free tokens, and to LegendOfMax and ParanoiaSurvivorMax for making me lose the feeling in my thumbs for grabbing onto the bar.

1200
01:12:50,191 --> 01:12:52,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Bar Raper!

1201
01:12:52,692 --> 01:12:53,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

1202
01:12:55,333 --> 01:12:56,533
[SPEAKER_03]: We all gotta get some somewhere.

1203
01:12:56,593 --> 01:12:57,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people get it from the bar.

1204
01:12:57,654 --> 01:12:58,054
[SPEAKER_03]: That's alright.

1205
01:12:59,794 --> 01:13:04,896
[SPEAKER_03]: SkylineDC505 would like to say F you to term papers and car insurance rates for teens.

1206
01:13:05,456 --> 01:13:05,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Ouch.

1207
01:13:09,113 --> 01:13:17,623
[SPEAKER_03]: JapanMan would like to say, yayay, fuck extreme for giving me the worst non-stop random all-course La Señorita, Butterfly, Be In My Paradise, and Get Up And Move.

1208
01:13:17,964 --> 01:13:18,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Sucks my butt.

1209
01:13:18,925 --> 01:13:20,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Sucks ass, actually, damn it.

1210
01:13:21,128 --> 01:13:26,915
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck stupid-ass people at Halo LAN parties that are on your team and kill you because they think it's fun.

1211
01:13:27,415 --> 01:13:28,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck yeah, okay, the end?

1212
01:13:32,096 --> 01:13:37,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Vandalists would like to say, my FU is for Fred Phelps and his godhatesfags.com website.

1213
01:13:37,238 --> 01:13:37,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you!

1214
01:13:37,898 --> 01:13:38,818
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot to mention that.

1215
01:13:38,838 --> 01:13:41,199
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my other thing I was going to say FU to.

1216
01:13:41,579 --> 01:13:44,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm particularly irritated by the following off that site.

1217
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:48,182
[SPEAKER_03]: He gives a link and vandalists feel free to post that in the chat room because it's too long for me to read.

1218
01:13:48,662 --> 01:13:51,103
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're going to protest Mr. Rogers' funeral.

1219
01:13:51,852 --> 01:13:54,274
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying that Mr. Rogers is going to burn in hell because he was a sissy.

1220
01:13:54,874 --> 01:13:55,355
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1221
01:13:55,395 --> 01:14:08,263
[SPEAKER_03]: These are those radical... They're those radical idiot people at godhatesfags.com and if you ever... They're the people that I want to go after with shotguns just because... Oh my god, there's not a more godly person than Mr. Rogers ever.

1222
01:14:08,784 --> 01:14:11,666
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't possibly protest anything the man ever did.

1223
01:14:12,461 --> 01:14:14,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Terry, put that link up in the chatroom.

1224
01:14:14,021 --> 01:14:14,702
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't believe us.

1225
01:14:15,082 --> 01:14:17,723
[SPEAKER_03]: So put that link up and see it for yourselves.

1226
01:14:17,783 --> 01:14:20,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people out there are very sick and need to go on Battle Royale.

1227
01:14:21,864 --> 01:14:30,406
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you you put people like that who hide behind, you know, something that they've made up, you know, this, this, whatever.

1228
01:14:30,446 --> 01:14:32,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even going to get into the whole debate on here.

1229
01:14:33,067 --> 01:14:42,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only has he put up GodHatesSpags.com, but he's also put up GodHatesAmerica.com, and he's spoofed God Bless America into God Hates America.

1230
01:14:43,614 --> 01:14:45,895
[SPEAKER_03]: And coming up next is... How the hell does he do that?

1231
01:14:47,636 --> 01:14:50,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming up next is God Hates Bomani.

1232
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:53,840
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright, Fred Phelps, you go to hell!

1233
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,060
[SPEAKER_26]: You go to hell, you die now!

1234
01:14:55,821 --> 01:14:57,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on.

1235
01:14:57,082 --> 01:14:57,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1236
01:14:57,982 --> 01:14:58,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1237
01:14:58,783 --> 01:15:00,083
[SPEAKER_18]: Angel wants to say hi to Vandalist!

1238
01:15:00,103 --> 01:15:00,544
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes!

1239
01:15:01,294 --> 01:15:01,654
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1240
01:15:02,255 --> 01:15:02,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1241
01:15:03,075 --> 01:15:05,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Yuko would like to say, Okay, my fuck you is to Mark.

1242
01:15:06,198 --> 01:15:06,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoever Mark is.

1243
01:15:06,918 --> 01:15:09,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you for fucking leaving me at the movies all by myself.

1244
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:11,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Making me walk home in the dark by myself.

1245
01:15:11,822 --> 01:15:13,143
[SPEAKER_03]: He needs to die.

1246
01:15:13,443 --> 01:15:13,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes he does.

1247
01:15:14,644 --> 01:15:15,104
[SPEAKER_03]: That's mean.

1248
01:15:15,904 --> 01:15:24,551
[SPEAKER_03]: And an F you to my cell phone because it's damn clip has to unclip when I'm running across a busy road so I have to go searching for it when I'm flipping out about it almost being run over.

1249
01:15:26,761 --> 01:15:32,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Rice Princess would like to say, fuck you to playing Foundation of Our Love over and over again, change the song.

1250
01:15:33,763 --> 01:15:36,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Although she likes that song, I just used it to all hell.

1251
01:15:36,243 --> 01:15:36,743
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

1252
01:15:37,884 --> 01:15:42,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Vidpala would like to say, F you to homework, F you to getting teacher recommendations.

1253
01:15:43,585 --> 01:15:44,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I always thought that was a good thing, but whatever.

1254
01:15:45,545 --> 01:15:52,367
[SPEAKER_03]: And F you to not being able to get the turntable on the right-hand side of Beatmania 2DX when I'm playing on first player, but other than that, 2DX is awesome.

1255
01:15:54,426 --> 01:15:57,951
[SPEAKER_19]: Hit the white key, then go to save.

1256
01:15:57,971 --> 01:15:58,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1257
01:16:12,529 --> 01:16:13,930
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's use the second player side.

1258
01:16:13,970 --> 01:16:15,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just do it on the two player side.

1259
01:16:15,030 --> 01:16:17,392
[SPEAKER_03]: There must be something, there's some greater scheme going on.

1260
01:16:18,052 --> 01:16:18,372
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1261
01:16:18,572 --> 01:16:20,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, that does it for the FUs of the week.

1262
01:16:20,553 --> 01:16:21,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray, we're through it.

1263
01:16:24,495 --> 01:16:26,596
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like just moving right on into the cage match.

1264
01:16:26,636 --> 01:16:27,256
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you guys say?

1265
01:16:28,177 --> 01:16:28,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1266
01:16:28,677 --> 01:16:29,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do that.

1267
01:16:29,137 --> 01:16:30,618
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to move right on into the cage match.

1268
01:16:30,658 --> 01:16:31,679
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to queue some things up.

1269
01:16:32,319 --> 01:16:35,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that CD's all ready to go, but I need to queue up this CD as well.

1270
01:16:37,001 --> 01:16:41,984
[SPEAKER_03]: So, does anybody else have anything they'd like to say about the FUs of the week while I'm trying to queue up some cage match things?

1271
01:16:47,765 --> 01:16:48,886
[SPEAKER_03]: will come up with something.

1272
01:16:50,567 --> 01:16:53,109
[SPEAKER_19]: I like traffic, like, oh wait, what?

1273
01:16:53,789 --> 01:16:54,150
[SPEAKER_19]: No!

1274
01:16:55,090 --> 01:16:55,510
[SPEAKER_19]: No!

1275
01:16:56,691 --> 01:16:58,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Throwing ferrets back and forth is fun.

1276
01:16:58,753 --> 01:16:59,353
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, it is.

1277
01:17:00,494 --> 01:17:00,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't it?

1278
01:17:01,475 --> 01:17:02,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't it fun?

1279
01:17:02,215 --> 01:17:04,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, isn't it fun, Loki?

1280
01:17:04,357 --> 01:17:04,977
Isn't it fun?

1281
01:17:05,998 --> 01:17:07,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you were saying something?

1282
01:17:07,999 --> 01:17:09,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I was laying at my watch.

1283
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:12,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, screw that.

1284
01:17:13,463 --> 01:17:14,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's the ferret?

1285
01:17:14,023 --> 01:17:15,384
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to throw it somewhere.

1286
01:17:15,404 --> 01:17:15,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Give me the ferret.

1287
01:17:19,476 --> 01:17:20,717
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, fuck these lights.

1288
01:17:20,737 --> 01:17:21,497
[SPEAKER_09]: They're too bright.

1289
01:17:48,976 --> 01:17:52,899
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got a microphone, it's the microphone I have, here we go, into the cage match, ladies and gentlemen, last week...

1290
01:18:16,819 --> 01:18:28,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Two weeks ago on the Orange Lounge Radio Cage match, Loki brought in this song called Spente La Selle, and it's pretty cool.

1291
01:18:28,483 --> 01:18:29,143
[SPEAKER_03]: And it won!

1292
01:18:29,624 --> 01:18:34,826
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been the winner for two weeks now, because, oh yeah, it's some special mix.

1293
01:18:35,986 --> 01:18:38,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Vocal Club Mix, it doesn't say the remixes on there.

1294
01:18:38,487 --> 01:18:38,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is.

1295
01:18:39,107 --> 01:18:40,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a clip of last week's winner.

1296
01:18:40,467 --> 01:18:52,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the way the cage match works, we play three songs, we only play a clip of the song that won last time, and then you vote, and the song you vote as winner goes into rotation on Orange Lounge with Monty Music and more, which plays all the time on this station when we're not here.

1297
01:18:53,591 --> 01:18:53,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1298
01:18:54,091 --> 01:18:59,212
[SPEAKER_09]: If he's not, if this guy's not leaving, he'd have to, like... Yes.

1299
01:18:59,452 --> 01:18:59,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is.

1300
01:18:59,832 --> 01:19:01,973
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Opera Trance with Spente Listelli.

1301
01:19:01,993 --> 01:19:03,853
[SPEAKER_03]: This is last week's winner, and we're going to play just a clip of it.

1302
01:19:34,332 --> 01:19:39,414
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

1303
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:16,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's last week's winner, or two weeks ago's winner, that's Spente La Stelle by Opera Trance.

1304
01:20:17,228 --> 01:20:19,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, moving right along, let's go into Jamie's pick, shall we?

1305
01:20:19,751 --> 01:20:20,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, would you like to tell us about your pick?

1306
01:20:22,737 --> 01:20:23,597
[SPEAKER_19]: No, play it.

1307
01:20:23,998 --> 01:20:24,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Just play it?

1308
01:20:24,578 --> 01:20:25,820
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't even want to introduce it?

1309
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:27,602
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to give them the name to vote for?

1310
01:20:27,702 --> 01:20:28,603
[SPEAKER_19]: JB sent me this.

1311
01:20:29,103 --> 01:20:31,265
[SPEAKER_03]: JB sent you this, but do you want to even say what it is?

1312
01:20:32,046 --> 01:20:36,671
[SPEAKER_19]: Wildside Queen of Love Speed Version.

1313
01:20:37,512 --> 01:20:39,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Wildside Queen of Love Speed Version.

1314
01:20:39,534 --> 01:20:41,716
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the second entry in the Orange Lounge Cage match.

1315
01:20:41,816 --> 01:20:42,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy.

1316
01:24:17,533 --> 01:24:18,254
[SPEAKER_14]: and many more.

1317
01:24:52,524 --> 01:24:54,246
Thank you for watching!

1318
01:25:29,578 --> 01:25:36,559
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that is WildSide, who's... WildSide's been a pretty popular pick in the cage match lately.

1319
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,900
[SPEAKER_03]: WildSide has been in the cage match quite a little bit lately.

1320
01:25:40,940 --> 01:25:46,201
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Queen of Love, and you might have recognized that as being Bukhwa from 3rd Korean.

1321
01:25:46,261 --> 01:25:54,503
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's go around the room and see what everyone thought of WildSide, Queen of Love, starting with Puppy.

1322
01:25:56,603 --> 01:25:58,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounded like the original version a lot.

1323
01:26:00,746 --> 01:26:02,627
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of a cool song, but I'd say a 7.5.

1324
01:26:02,767 --> 01:26:07,871
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a big 5, because it sucks.

1325
01:26:09,312 --> 01:26:13,294
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hate Wild Side.

1326
01:26:15,415 --> 01:26:17,697
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, it sucked.

1327
01:26:17,757 --> 01:26:18,718
[SPEAKER_08]: The original was better.

1328
01:26:19,218 --> 01:26:22,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Wild Side sucks, because they can't do any of their own songs.

1329
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:24,701
[SPEAKER_08]: They just do covers, and they suck ass.

1330
01:26:25,282 --> 01:26:26,803
[SPEAKER_08]: And Sci-Fam sucks as a piss-off TV show.

1331
01:26:29,085 --> 01:26:34,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, Santa doesn't suck, but I definitely have a kiss against the wild side.

1332
01:26:35,331 --> 01:26:36,673
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll give it a four and a half.

1333
01:26:37,514 --> 01:26:37,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Angel?

1334
01:26:37,774 --> 01:26:45,642
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, it did sound like a lot, or not like the original, but, uh, I don't know, it was alright.

1335
01:26:45,742 --> 01:26:46,563
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd say four.

1336
01:26:55,262 --> 01:26:57,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, they weren't kidding when they said everything must change.

1337
01:26:57,824 --> 01:26:59,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Including the lyrics, damn.

1338
01:26:59,906 --> 01:27:02,047
[SPEAKER_05]: But still, not bad for an experience.

1339
01:27:02,087 --> 01:27:03,548
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it cause my Itoko sent it to me.

1340
01:27:03,648 --> 01:27:03,949
It gets a 12.

1341
01:27:18,823 --> 01:27:21,844
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay, I think a lot of you guys are being too harsh on it, it's not bad.

1342
01:27:23,424 --> 01:27:26,505
[SPEAKER_03]: But Kwa's better, it really is, but it's not bad.

1343
01:27:26,805 --> 01:27:28,085
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd listen to that on a rainy day.

1344
01:27:28,606 --> 01:27:30,406
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd give it a 7.

1345
01:27:31,206 --> 01:27:32,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so.

1346
01:27:32,747 --> 01:27:33,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, my pick.

1347
01:27:34,727 --> 01:27:35,988
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to pick a different song.

1348
01:27:36,008 --> 01:27:45,130
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to pick a song... Okay, last night at the party, this guy Garrett, who's new in town, that plays... Well, he's not really new in town, actually, he's lived here his whole life, but he's new to the Sack of Omani scene.

1349
01:27:46,251 --> 01:27:49,875
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw him randomly playing 2DX one night and we just kind of sucked him up into our little circle.

1350
01:27:50,335 --> 01:27:53,018
[SPEAKER_03]: And it turns out he owns a copy of Amplitude.

1351
01:27:53,378 --> 01:27:54,039
[SPEAKER_03]: You haven't met him yet.

1352
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:55,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1353
01:27:56,341 --> 01:27:59,604
[SPEAKER_03]: He has Amplitude and he brought that over to the little shindig we had last night.

1354
01:27:59,965 --> 01:28:03,768
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a song on there I fucking love by Freeze Pop.

1355
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:07,252
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Super Sprode by Freeze Pop.

1356
01:28:07,552 --> 01:28:08,093
[SPEAKER_03]: However...

1357
01:28:09,975 --> 01:28:10,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I talk?

1358
01:28:10,495 --> 01:28:10,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I speak?

1359
01:28:11,035 --> 01:28:11,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I speak?

1360
01:28:11,396 --> 01:28:11,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I finish?

1361
01:28:11,936 --> 01:28:12,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I finish?

1362
01:28:13,356 --> 01:28:13,537
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1363
01:28:13,737 --> 01:28:13,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

1364
01:28:14,757 --> 01:28:17,418
[SPEAKER_03]: But I couldn't find a copy of Super Sprode, which kind of sucks.

1365
01:28:17,758 --> 01:28:22,480
[SPEAKER_03]: But I did find another song by Freeze Pop that kicks a lot of ass, so this is my cage match pick for this week.

1366
01:28:22,820 --> 01:28:25,602
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Science Genius Girl.

1367
01:28:25,882 --> 01:28:29,103
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is my cage match pick from Freeze Pop.

1368
01:28:29,543 --> 01:28:30,284
[SPEAKER_03]: So enjoy.

1369
01:29:15,986 --> 01:29:17,949
It will be a member of my band

1370
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:06,513
[SPEAKER_14]: It will be a member of my band

1371
01:30:30,151 --> 01:30:30,811
Measure up the chemicals

1372
01:30:58,115 --> 01:30:59,836
[SPEAKER_14]: Safety goggles on my eyes.

1373
01:30:59,856 --> 01:31:01,057
[SPEAKER_14]: Turn the fountain burner on.

1374
01:31:01,077 --> 01:31:01,978
[SPEAKER_14]: My creation comes alive.

1375
01:31:01,998 --> 01:31:03,239
[SPEAKER_14]: I have come, a human being.

1376
01:31:03,419 --> 01:31:04,360
It is here and holds my hand.

1377
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:05,901
[SPEAKER_14]: I have come, a human being.

1378
01:31:05,921 --> 01:31:08,864
[SPEAKER_14]: It is now a member of my band.

1379
01:31:08,904 --> 01:31:10,505
[SPEAKER_14]: I have come, a human being.

1380
01:31:26,215 --> 01:31:42,468
[SPEAKER_14]: It is now a member of my band I have grown a human being It is now a member of my band I have grown a human being It is now a member of my band

1381
01:31:58,935 --> 01:32:03,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that was, I'm being told that's actually in frequency, but I wouldn't even know because I've never played frequency.

1382
01:32:04,296 --> 01:32:07,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Freeze Pop with Science Genius Girl, that was my pick.

1383
01:32:07,497 --> 01:32:10,717
[SPEAKER_03]: So, let's go around the room, what did y'all think of that?

1384
01:32:10,757 --> 01:32:11,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie?

1385
01:32:11,377 --> 01:32:12,518
One second.

1386
01:32:13,258 --> 01:32:14,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I was drinking her Propel.

1387
01:32:17,739 --> 01:32:18,439
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what it gets.

1388
01:32:19,399 --> 01:32:19,779
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets a burp.

1389
01:32:19,839 --> 01:32:21,119
[SPEAKER_02]: A weak burp for a weak song.

1390
01:32:21,159 --> 01:32:21,839
[SPEAKER_02]: You suck.

1391
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:23,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Magus?

1392
01:32:23,860 --> 01:32:24,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1393
01:32:26,673 --> 01:32:27,473
[SPEAKER_13]: Not good.

1394
01:32:27,493 --> 01:32:27,953
[SPEAKER_13]: Not good.

1395
01:32:27,973 --> 01:32:28,433
[SPEAKER_13]: Not good.

1396
01:32:28,693 --> 01:32:30,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Eat me.

1397
01:32:30,134 --> 01:32:30,854
[SPEAKER_13]: Eat me.

1398
01:32:31,154 --> 01:32:32,054
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1399
01:32:32,074 --> 01:32:32,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Three.

1400
01:32:33,354 --> 01:32:33,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Three?

1401
01:32:34,394 --> 01:32:34,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1402
01:32:35,755 --> 01:32:36,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Freeze Pop.

1403
01:32:36,375 --> 01:32:37,275
[SPEAKER_03]: What does Freeze Pop get?

1404
01:32:38,275 --> 01:32:38,815
[SPEAKER_03]: TGR Angel.

1405
01:32:38,835 --> 01:32:42,336
[SPEAKER_14]: I liked it, except it was kind of making me fall asleep.

1406
01:32:43,256 --> 01:32:43,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

1407
01:32:43,756 --> 01:32:44,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

1408
01:32:44,196 --> 01:32:48,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, um... Oh my god.

1409
01:32:48,657 --> 01:32:49,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Not your turn.

1410
01:32:49,797 --> 01:32:50,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel.

1411
01:32:52,277 --> 01:32:54,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're going last, so you can wait.

1412
01:32:54,658 --> 01:32:54,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel.

1413
01:32:56,869 --> 01:33:03,095
[SPEAKER_18]: I really, I really did like the beat, but, you know... Six.

1414
01:33:03,475 --> 01:33:03,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Zero.

1415
01:33:04,576 --> 01:33:07,018
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, she just gave you that sourcing.

1416
01:33:07,038 --> 01:33:12,403
[SPEAKER_06]: No, okay, first of all, I don't remember which fucking game that was from.

1417
01:33:12,583 --> 01:33:16,447
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care, I must not, I really must not have paid attention to that crappy-ass song.

1418
01:33:16,987 --> 01:33:21,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I heard the fucking DWI to that, and I thought it was cool for, like...

1419
01:33:22,131 --> 01:33:23,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Negative 4 seconds.

1420
01:33:23,832 --> 01:33:25,454
[SPEAKER_06]: It was cool before it started.

1421
01:33:25,494 --> 01:33:27,655
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even know there was a DWI.

1422
01:33:27,755 --> 01:33:29,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, the best part about that song was when it ended.

1423
01:33:29,737 --> 01:33:32,579
[SPEAKER_06]: I give it a negative 80 million.

1424
01:33:34,338 --> 01:33:39,062
[SPEAKER_06]: But don't worry, Rob, though, because, you know, that song that you were talking about earlier is going to win everybody over.

1425
01:33:39,322 --> 01:33:39,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

1426
01:33:40,803 --> 01:33:41,044
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

1427
01:33:41,144 --> 01:33:42,765
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll win it next week for sure.

1428
01:33:45,287 --> 01:33:47,609
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not Wildside, and it's not the ketchup song.

1429
01:33:47,689 --> 01:33:48,810
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll give it a six and a half.

1430
01:33:48,950 --> 01:33:49,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, thank you.

1431
01:33:52,393 --> 01:33:59,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, um, gee, I wish I could be a wannabe goth girl and hit the keyboard at random and sing a song in monotone.

1432
01:34:01,408 --> 01:34:06,391
[SPEAKER_08]: If you had a woman, William Shatner, that would pretty much be pretty close to what that was right there.

1433
01:34:07,912 --> 01:34:09,073
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, and he would be better.

1434
01:34:09,433 --> 01:34:10,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, let's just put it this way.

1435
01:34:10,674 --> 01:34:15,456
[SPEAKER_08]: I can see why it was infrequency, because it probably cost nothing to license, since it sucks major ass.

1436
01:34:16,297 --> 01:34:18,578
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, I'm giving it a one.

1437
01:34:19,319 --> 01:34:19,679
[SPEAKER_08]: A one.

1438
01:34:21,020 --> 01:34:21,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Sucks me.

1439
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:25,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you people out there who just vote against my song because you try to piss me off.

1440
01:34:26,163 --> 01:34:29,845
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care, because I'll come back stronger, better, faster.

1441
01:34:30,933 --> 01:34:31,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, one last thing.

1442
01:34:31,953 --> 01:34:35,815
[SPEAKER_06]: As for the previous song, I enjoyed the previous song very well.

1443
01:34:36,115 --> 01:34:36,596
[SPEAKER_08]: I give it an 8.

1444
01:34:39,917 --> 01:34:48,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, I know this is really, really late and out of segment, but, uh, F you stupid AOL commercials, because, uh, I don't want to see an icon sleep with some ugly hoe.

1445
01:34:48,862 --> 01:34:49,202
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

1446
01:34:50,762 --> 01:34:53,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, as late as that comment was, I'll ignore it now.

1447
01:34:53,484 --> 01:34:55,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, because AOL's got a scree anyway.

1448
01:34:57,005 --> 01:34:57,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1449
01:34:58,546 --> 01:34:59,267
[SPEAKER_19]: Shut the hell up.

1450
01:34:59,287 --> 01:34:59,627
[SPEAKER_19]: Speak!

1451
01:35:00,609 --> 01:35:01,531
[SPEAKER_09]: That song owns.

1452
01:35:02,594 --> 01:35:03,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Breezepop owns you.

1453
01:35:05,701 --> 01:35:06,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, they do.

1454
01:35:06,723 --> 01:35:07,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Ten.

1455
01:35:11,602 --> 01:35:14,943
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that song was pretty good, and I liked it on frequency, so I give it an 8.

1456
01:35:16,203 --> 01:35:20,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, now, I give this a perfect score, and let me tell you why, okay?

1457
01:35:20,865 --> 01:35:24,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I sat down, and I patiently listened to all your bullshit, and so you're gonna listen to me now.

1458
01:35:25,126 --> 01:35:32,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, first off, Freeze Pop, Science Union's girl, band out of Boston, they're playing modern new wave music from the electro-clash school of style, okay?

1459
01:35:33,309 --> 01:35:33,849
[SPEAKER_02]: They're ma-

1460
01:35:35,209 --> 01:35:38,571
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys fucking own you for free.

1461
01:35:38,771 --> 01:35:39,411
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1462
01:35:39,571 --> 01:35:39,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you.

1463
01:35:40,092 --> 01:35:40,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna wait.

1464
01:35:40,652 --> 01:35:40,992
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll wait.

1465
01:35:41,052 --> 01:35:41,653
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna wait.

1466
01:35:41,713 --> 01:35:42,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

1467
01:35:42,133 --> 01:35:42,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna wait.

1468
01:35:43,133 --> 01:35:43,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Now check this out.

1469
01:35:44,294 --> 01:35:47,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Science Genius Girls is a brilliant competition.

1470
01:35:47,996 --> 01:35:50,197
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really well-made new wave song.

1471
01:35:50,217 --> 01:35:53,539
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really well-made modern industrial pop song, okay?

1472
01:35:54,247 --> 01:35:56,409
[SPEAKER_02]: The song is really cool, and it's fun!

1473
01:35:56,689 --> 01:36:01,293
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun to play, it makes the game better, and... Yeah, shut the fuck up, Zero.

1474
01:36:01,313 --> 01:36:05,096
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know what the hell you're talking about anyways, cause you're like, OH MY GOD IT SUCKS!

1475
01:36:07,138 --> 01:36:08,759
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing is that- Okay, no, hold on!

1476
01:36:08,959 --> 01:36:14,124
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, the only reason why you know all this shit about this band is because you have to make up for how much they fucking suck!

1477
01:36:15,405 --> 01:36:16,946
[SPEAKER_02]: If they sucked, I wouldn't care!

1478
01:36:17,266 --> 01:36:20,349
[SPEAKER_04]: If they sucked, you wouldn't care- you're carrying right now if they suck!

1479
01:36:21,215 --> 01:36:22,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen to the song again!

1480
01:36:23,136 --> 01:36:24,436
[SPEAKER_04]: I have like seven remixes.

1481
01:36:24,536 --> 01:36:25,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I have their album.

1482
01:36:25,936 --> 01:36:26,577
[SPEAKER_04]: That's sad.

1483
01:36:27,057 --> 01:36:28,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you find it in like a five cent bin?

1484
01:36:29,238 --> 01:36:29,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

1485
01:36:31,558 --> 01:36:32,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven remixes what?

1486
01:36:32,579 --> 01:36:34,679
[SPEAKER_04]: They had to take seven fucking times to make it right?

1487
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:37,500
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a hoe man!

1488
01:36:37,660 --> 01:36:38,760
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a hoe!

1489
01:36:38,801 --> 01:36:41,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Well at least I don't sleep with my mother!

1490
01:36:43,362 --> 01:36:44,442
[SPEAKER_19]: Everyone shut up!

1491
01:36:45,263 --> 01:36:46,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Your dog was better!

1492
01:36:48,926 --> 01:36:55,489
[SPEAKER_03]: I have nothing wrong with the style, I just didn't like that one.

1493
01:36:56,209 --> 01:36:59,210
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why it wasn't a burp.

1494
01:36:59,250 --> 01:37:00,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, the ketchup song?

1495
01:37:01,131 --> 01:37:03,052
[SPEAKER_04]: What in the hell did I miss in five weeks?

1496
01:37:03,892 --> 01:37:05,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, do you have a hickey on your ass yet?

1497
01:37:06,713 --> 01:37:09,214
[SPEAKER_06]: From that side of the room, you got a hickey on your ass.

1498
01:37:19,045 --> 01:37:22,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Forgive me for liking people like Fischer Fuder and Creed Paul, man.

1499
01:37:22,046 --> 01:37:22,726
[SPEAKER_02]: I go to clubs like that.

1500
01:37:22,766 --> 01:37:24,167
[SPEAKER_19]: No one else gives a microphone!

1501
01:37:25,928 --> 01:37:29,149
[SPEAKER_03]: The chatroom says Cage Match is turning into an actual Cage Match.

1502
01:37:29,169 --> 01:37:29,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Time to vote.

1503
01:37:30,749 --> 01:37:31,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1504
01:37:31,310 --> 01:37:32,390
[SPEAKER_19]: Battle Royale, I win.

1505
01:37:32,490 --> 01:37:33,971
[SPEAKER_03]: First song you can vote for.

01:37:34,051 --> 01:37:34,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a clip.

[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, next one you can vote for, Wild Side, Queen of Love.

1509
01:38:00,501 --> 01:38:04,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, last one, the ever controversial Freeze Pop with Science Genius Girl.

1510
01:38:15,017 --> 01:38:15,617
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1511
01:38:16,578 --> 01:38:17,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.

1512
01:38:17,538 --> 01:38:19,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Things are going crazy in here.

1513
01:38:19,218 --> 01:38:19,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1514
01:38:21,099 --> 01:38:25,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Send your votes now over private message in the chat room to Sky.

1515
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,981
[SPEAKER_03]: No more talking about Cage Match songs.

1516
01:38:29,421 --> 01:38:29,941
[SPEAKER_03]: No more.

1517
01:38:30,261 --> 01:38:30,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Sit down.

1518
01:38:31,101 --> 01:38:31,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Sit down.

1519
01:38:31,581 --> 01:38:31,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

1520
01:38:32,402 --> 01:38:32,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1521
01:38:34,982 --> 01:38:37,523
[SPEAKER_19]: Sit your ass down in that chair and drink your goddamn tea.

1522
01:38:42,293 --> 01:38:43,494
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the Final Fantasy quote.

1523
01:38:43,534 --> 01:38:45,335
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the best video game quote ever.

1524
01:38:46,216 --> 01:38:46,637
[SPEAKER_19]: It's it.

1525
01:38:47,357 --> 01:38:50,440
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice.

1526
01:38:52,441 --> 01:38:53,062
[SPEAKER_19]: Dead air!

1527
01:38:53,422 --> 01:38:53,962
[SPEAKER_19]: Yay!

1528
01:38:58,346 --> 01:39:00,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I had to type that out for the chat room so I could see what they were going for.

1529
01:39:00,888 --> 01:39:02,789
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's get a little break so that Sanford can calm down.

1530
01:39:03,230 --> 01:39:05,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's go to a break and everybody's going to be doing some yoga.

1531
01:39:06,032 --> 01:39:06,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's going to do some yoga.

1532
01:39:06,953 --> 01:39:10,636
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to play Journey into Wonderland and Usau Kun.

1533
01:39:11,553 --> 01:39:11,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, what?

1534
01:39:11,994 --> 01:39:12,434
[SPEAKER_03]: What, Loki?

1535
01:39:12,454 --> 01:39:12,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry?

1536
01:39:14,417 --> 01:39:17,001
[SPEAKER_08]: You have something you want to bring up?

1537
01:39:17,041 --> 01:39:17,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Porn!

1538
01:39:18,063 --> 01:39:18,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes?

1539
01:39:18,223 --> 01:39:18,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Not porn!

1540
01:39:19,064 --> 01:39:20,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Porn's not depressing!

1541
01:39:20,446 --> 01:39:21,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Stupid!

1542
01:39:21,648 --> 01:39:26,916
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I was going to talk about how this, actually, Monday we had to put my dog down.

1543
01:39:28,893 --> 01:39:29,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Awww!

1544
01:39:30,414 --> 01:39:30,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1545
01:39:32,055 --> 01:39:34,177
[SPEAKER_08]: She's not seven million years old, she was fourteen!

1546
01:39:35,378 --> 01:39:49,389
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we had to put my dog asleep, so we buried her up in, uh, Placerville area, up at some lake or something, and then between these trees we gave her her blanket, and... STOP HANDING ME YOUR FUCKING KEYS!

1547
01:39:51,676 --> 01:40:01,018
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we put her bone and stuff in there, so that was kind of sad.

1548
01:40:01,639 --> 01:40:03,579
[SPEAKER_19]: At least you didn't take pictures like Oolong.

1549
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:06,840
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not that I'm aware of.

1550
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:07,280
[SPEAKER_19]: Good.

1551
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,421
[SPEAKER_19]: I would be wondering about your sanity.

1552
01:40:11,781 --> 01:40:12,701
[SPEAKER_19]: But I'm sorry about your dog.

1553
01:40:12,921 --> 01:40:13,482
[SPEAKER_08]: That's alright.

1554
01:40:15,882 --> 01:40:17,803
[SPEAKER_19]: for me, who doesn't like dogs, I liked your dog.

1555
01:40:18,303 --> 01:40:19,003
[SPEAKER_08]: She was cool.

1556
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:39,890
[SPEAKER_08]: But she was old, and she was in pain, so we decided, I mean, she didn't die naturally, we just took her to the vet to have her put her to sleep because she was in pain, and she couldn't walk, and her back legs were going paralyzed, and she had cysts all over the place, and probably cysts on the inside of her, and she was having terrible breathing, and you know, all that wonderful stuff that we were just like, okay, we're just gonna put you down.

1557
01:40:40,950 --> 01:40:43,292
[SPEAKER_08]: It was hard having to say goodbye to her, though, before I had to go to work.

1558
01:40:44,313 --> 01:40:46,174
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to say a final goodbye.

1559
01:40:46,194 --> 01:40:47,515
[SPEAKER_08]: It's sad.

1560
01:40:48,235 --> 01:40:54,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well... Okay, before we turn... Now we've gone from Jerry Springer to, like, Depression Hour.

1561
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:55,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's Oprah.

1562
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:56,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1563
01:40:57,141 --> 01:41:01,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, but we're gonna play some... We're gonna cool down tempers by playing some mellow songs.

1564
01:41:01,463 --> 01:41:02,804
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna play some mellow things.

1565
01:41:03,805 --> 01:41:03,985
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1566
01:41:05,806 --> 01:41:09,189
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be back, and we're going to play a fun game when we come back.

1567
01:41:09,209 --> 01:41:10,289
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to play a game.

1568
01:41:10,469 --> 01:41:12,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it called Science Genius Girl Sucks?

1569
01:41:12,251 --> 01:41:17,394
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's called... Let's shove the mic up, Loki.

1570
01:41:17,434 --> 01:41:18,555
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no more.

1571
01:41:18,575 --> 01:41:20,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, no, no, hold on.

1572
01:41:24,393 --> 01:41:25,635
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see a hug.

1573
01:41:26,055 --> 01:41:26,716
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see a hug.

1574
01:41:27,557 --> 01:41:29,019
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to break until we see a hug.

1575
01:41:29,299 --> 01:41:29,940
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see a hug.

1576
01:41:30,941 --> 01:41:33,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

1577
01:41:33,123 --> 01:41:33,824
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.

1578
01:41:34,545 --> 01:41:35,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that was nice.

1579
01:41:36,147 --> 01:41:36,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here's a break.

1580
01:41:52,559 --> 01:41:53,122

1584
01:43:42,143 --> 01:44:10,779

1585
01:44:15,988 --> 01:44:18,071
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for watching!

1586
01:46:05,580 --> 01:46:06,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, we're back.

1587
01:46:06,501 --> 01:46:09,563
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot to queue up a promo, so we're just back.

1588
01:46:09,923 --> 01:46:15,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I'm going to play one more song because things are a little chaotic right now.

1589
01:46:16,568 --> 01:46:23,913
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still trying to set up for match games, so enjoy one more mellow song, and then we'll be right back.

1590
01:46:24,013 --> 01:46:25,294
[SPEAKER_03]: So one more mellow song, we'll be back.

1591
01:46:31,678 --> 01:46:32,279
Mellow Song

1592
01:48:03,676 --> 01:48:04,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1593
01:48:05,237 --> 01:48:07,399
[SPEAKER_03]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

1594
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:12,384
[SPEAKER_03]: This server made up his mind, yeah, number... This server made up his mind, yeah, number...

1595
01:48:15,722 --> 01:48:16,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit.

1596
01:48:16,543 --> 01:48:21,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, trying to get all that stuff worked out for a match game was a little crazy tonight.

1597
01:48:22,156 --> 01:48:23,118
[SPEAKER_03]: So many people in-house.

1598
01:48:23,218 --> 01:48:23,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1599
01:48:24,641 --> 01:48:25,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, what?

1600
01:48:27,031 --> 01:48:27,311
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1601
01:48:28,272 --> 01:48:30,834
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, okay, we need contestants for the match game.

1602
01:48:30,914 --> 01:48:37,439
[SPEAKER_03]: So the way we're going to pick contestants for the match game would be... Okay, quick trivia question.

1603
01:48:37,459 --> 01:48:45,905
[SPEAKER_03]: The first two people in the chat room to message me the answer to this, there's a number in the title of that last song, and that number is whored out in a bunch of Konami products.

1604
01:48:45,965 --> 01:48:47,046
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a three-digit number.

1605
01:48:47,146 --> 01:48:47,646
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it?

1606
01:48:48,427 --> 01:48:53,951
[SPEAKER_03]: First two people to answer me what that number is by private message in the chat room get to be our contestants.

1607
01:48:54,511 --> 01:48:54,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1608
01:48:56,480 --> 01:49:01,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I'm going to announce the winner of the cage match.

1609
01:49:02,564 --> 01:49:05,786
[SPEAKER_03]: And drumroll please, the winner of the cage match.

1610
01:49:07,947 --> 01:49:16,072
[SPEAKER_03]: By a pretty narrow vote, the votes were pretty well spread out, but believe it or not, Controversy wins, you guys.

1611
01:49:17,193 --> 01:49:18,514
[SPEAKER_14]: Controversy wins.

1612
01:49:22,333 --> 01:49:25,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was because of the fight, if you guys hadn't gotten all Jerry Springer.

1613
01:49:26,655 --> 01:49:27,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think it was the hug too.

1614
01:49:29,236 --> 01:49:31,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so, uh, let's see.

1615
01:49:32,798 --> 01:49:40,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I have one person in, so SnubDisfanoid gets to participate in tonight's match game, and... Oh, VidPower sent a wrong answer.

1616
01:49:41,841 --> 01:49:44,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if we get any other, uh, correct answers.

1617
01:49:45,083 --> 01:49:45,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Waiting on one more.

1618
01:49:46,303 --> 01:49:47,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, oh, let's see, let's see.

1619
01:49:49,827 --> 01:49:51,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Rice Princess wants to know what the answer is.

1620
01:49:51,409 --> 01:49:52,350
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you've got to tell me.

1621
01:49:52,410 --> 01:49:57,216
[SPEAKER_03]: The question is, what's the number horned out in all the Konami games?

1622
01:49:58,057 --> 01:49:59,379
[SPEAKER_03]: She wants me to tell her the answer.

1623
01:50:00,921 --> 01:50:05,026
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a three-digit number, and it's in the title of the last song.

1624
01:50:05,046 --> 01:50:05,787
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll give you a clue.

1625
01:50:06,107 --> 01:50:06,688
[SPEAKER_19]: Konami.

1626
01:50:09,269 --> 01:50:10,830
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Skyline has it wrong too.

1627
01:50:11,271 --> 01:50:12,752
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have one contestant so far.

1628
01:50:13,213 --> 01:50:14,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Snub Dysphenoid.

1629
01:50:15,034 --> 01:50:16,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, let's see, let's see.

1630
01:50:17,656 --> 01:50:19,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, Rice Princess still wants me to just tell her.

1631
01:50:23,161 --> 01:50:24,202
[SPEAKER_03]: There, we just told you.

1632
01:50:25,383 --> 01:50:26,684
[SPEAKER_03]: We just told you the answer.

1633
01:50:27,765 --> 01:50:29,186
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Skyline's wrong again.

1634
01:50:30,928 --> 01:50:32,189
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we talked about this on the show.

1635
01:50:32,509 --> 01:50:33,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Shame on you all.

1636
01:50:35,312 --> 01:50:35,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh!

1637
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:39,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, let's see, let's see, let's see.

1638
01:50:41,062 --> 01:50:42,502
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go, Skyline gets it right.

1639
01:50:42,542 --> 01:50:45,404
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have our two contestants, SnubDisnoid and SkylineDC505.

1640
01:50:46,985 --> 01:50:48,046
[SPEAKER_03]: The answer is 573.

1641
01:50:51,147 --> 01:50:53,369
[SPEAKER_03]: And VidPower was so close, he said 572.

1642
01:50:53,449 --> 01:50:55,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Poor guy.

1643
01:50:58,591 --> 01:51:00,653
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he said, he said, no wait, no wait, 571.

1644
01:51:00,693 --> 01:51:00,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1645
01:51:04,910 --> 01:51:09,171
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there's our contestants, Snub and Skyline.

1646
01:51:09,711 --> 01:51:12,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, now we've got a whole mess of celebrities.

1647
01:51:12,872 --> 01:51:15,313
[SPEAKER_03]: We have so many people in here, we've had to tag team some folks.

1648
01:51:15,733 --> 01:51:23,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so, let's go around and... Oh, you know what?

1649
01:51:23,795 --> 01:51:26,796
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's really bad is I don't even have the match game music queued up.

1650
01:51:26,836 --> 01:51:29,817
[SPEAKER_03]: So somebody needs to explain how match game works, please, while I look for it.

1651
01:51:30,177 --> 01:51:31,717
[SPEAKER_19]: Fill in the blanks.

1652
01:51:32,318 --> 01:51:32,838
[SPEAKER_19]: There you go.

1653
01:51:33,438 --> 01:51:33,738
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually...

1654
01:51:35,001 --> 01:51:43,005
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, basically, Rob will read off the phrase to you, and then there's going to be a blank at the end of the phrase.

1655
01:51:43,265 --> 01:51:44,186
[SPEAKER_19]: You have to fill in the blank.

1656
01:51:45,126 --> 01:51:49,248
[SPEAKER_19]: So, yeah, watch the Game Show Network.

1657
01:51:50,589 --> 01:51:54,230
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, we are going to go around and put down what we think it is.

1658
01:51:54,671 --> 01:51:56,812
[SPEAKER_19]: You have to think of how we would answer it.

1659
01:51:58,164 --> 01:51:59,724
[SPEAKER_19]: and whoever gets it gets a point.

1660
01:51:59,824 --> 01:52:01,725
[SPEAKER_19]: However, if you don't, you're an ultimate loser.

1661
01:52:05,166 --> 01:52:15,488
[SPEAKER_19]: And our celebrities today are Rob, me, Angel, um, well, they're a tag team.

1662
01:52:16,928 --> 01:52:17,768
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, hey.

1663
01:52:20,569 --> 01:52:21,449
[SPEAKER_19]: This dork over here.

1664
01:52:27,808 --> 01:52:28,549
[SPEAKER_19]: The freestyler.

1665
01:52:29,229 --> 01:52:30,130
[SPEAKER_19]: The other white guy.

1666
01:52:30,410 --> 01:52:32,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the other white guy and Angel.

1667
01:52:39,056 --> 01:52:39,356
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1668
01:52:39,856 --> 01:52:41,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Needless to say, there's plenty of celebrities in the house.

1669
01:52:41,878 --> 01:52:43,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Puppy, yeah, we got it.

1670
01:52:43,359 --> 01:52:43,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1671
01:52:43,979 --> 01:52:45,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Joey tag-teaming with somebody?

1672
01:52:46,101 --> 01:52:46,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki?

1673
01:52:46,941 --> 01:52:47,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah.

1674
01:52:47,461 --> 01:52:48,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we got it.

1675
01:52:48,082 --> 01:52:48,842
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, here we go.

1676
01:52:51,564 --> 01:52:52,085
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.

1677
01:52:54,597 --> 01:52:56,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Puppy needs help with his answers.

1678
01:52:56,739 --> 01:52:57,480
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to tag team with him.

1679
01:52:57,580 --> 01:52:58,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1680
01:53:01,143 --> 01:53:02,564
[SPEAKER_03]: No more fighting, you guys.

1681
01:53:02,624 --> 01:53:05,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, this is turning into an ugly, ugly episode.

1682
01:53:05,187 --> 01:53:06,588
[SPEAKER_19]: Just do the game, damn it.

1683
01:53:07,669 --> 01:53:09,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Now Jamie's yelling at me.

1684
01:53:09,350 --> 01:53:10,611
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't take it.

1685
01:53:10,752 --> 01:53:11,572
[SPEAKER_12]: Ow, she kicked me.

1686
01:53:13,234 --> 01:53:13,594
[SPEAKER_03]: I cry.

1687
01:53:13,634 --> 01:53:14,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, first question.

1688
01:53:14,835 --> 01:53:17,938
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have my revenge because Jamie tonight is in two questions.

1689
01:53:21,283 --> 01:53:23,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, but first we're going to do a question about Angel.

1690
01:53:24,104 --> 01:53:24,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

1691
01:53:24,564 --> 01:53:25,584
[SPEAKER_14]: Please don't yell, I have asthma.

1692
01:53:25,604 --> 01:53:26,384
[SPEAKER_14]: Please don't yell, I have asthma.

1693
01:53:26,404 --> 01:53:27,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Please don't yell, I have asthma.

1694
01:53:27,044 --> 01:53:27,684
[SPEAKER_14]: Please don't yell, I have asthma.

1695
01:53:27,704 --> 01:53:28,825
[SPEAKER_14]: Please don't yell, I have asthma.

1696
01:53:28,845 --> 01:53:29,525
[SPEAKER_14]: Please don't yell, I have asthma.

1697
01:53:29,865 --> 01:53:31,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't yell, I have asthma.

1698
01:53:31,425 --> 01:53:32,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't yell, I have asthma.

1699
01:53:32,725 --> 01:53:33,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't yell, I have asthma.

1700
01:53:33,585 --> 01:53:34,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't yell, I have asthma.

1701
01:53:34,666 --> 01:53:37,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't yell, I have asthma.

1702
01:53:37,066 --> 01:53:38,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't yell, I have asthma.

1703
01:53:38,386 --> 01:53:40,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't yell, I have asthma.

1704
01:53:40,047 --> 01:53:41,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't yell, I have asthma.

1705
01:53:41,147 --> 01:53:42,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't yell, I have asthma.

1706
01:53:42,327 --> 01:53:43,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't yell, I have asthma.

1707
01:53:43,527 --> 01:53:44,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't yell, I have asthma.

1708
01:53:44,908 --> 01:53:45,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't yell, I have asthma.

1709
01:53:45,668 --> 01:53:46,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't yell, I have asthma.

1710
01:53:47,228 --> 01:53:48,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't yell, I have asthma.

1711
01:53:48,168 --> 01:53:49,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't yell, I have asthma.

1712
01:53:49,389 --> 01:53:50,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't yell, I have asthma.

1713
01:53:50,129 --> 01:53:50,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't yell, I have asthma

1714
01:53:55,663 --> 01:54:04,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel was very excited to be back from Japan, and her buddies in Sacto were excited to watch her carry two big bags of souvenirs through the door to her welcome home party.

1715
01:54:04,868 --> 01:54:07,950
[SPEAKER_03]: But they were shocked to find that the bags were full of nothing but blank.

1716
01:54:17,335 --> 01:54:19,617
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm waiting on both contestants to give me an answer.

1717
01:54:23,399 --> 01:54:23,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1718
01:54:26,454 --> 01:54:28,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there's one answer locked in.

1719
01:54:28,319 --> 01:54:29,503
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm waiting on one more answer.

1720
01:54:29,783 --> 01:54:32,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel carried in two bags full of blank.

1721
01:54:36,134 --> 01:54:37,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't give your answers aloud, please.

1722
01:54:37,875 --> 01:54:38,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1723
01:54:39,116 --> 01:54:40,476
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have our other contestant locked in.

1724
01:54:41,937 --> 01:54:43,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus Christ, it's going to be one of those days.

1725
01:54:44,159 --> 01:54:44,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1726
01:54:44,939 --> 01:54:47,080
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one of those contestants on the show tonight.

1727
01:54:47,661 --> 01:54:48,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1728
01:54:50,482 --> 01:54:51,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm just going to warn you all.

1729
01:54:51,563 --> 01:54:52,864
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one of those contestants.

1730
01:54:52,984 --> 01:54:53,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1731
01:54:53,684 --> 01:54:54,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody locked in in the room.

1732
01:54:55,445 --> 01:54:55,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1733
01:54:55,826 --> 01:54:56,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1734
01:54:56,566 --> 01:54:56,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

1735
01:54:58,327 --> 01:55:00,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Should I read the contestants first or us first?

1736
01:55:00,308 --> 01:55:00,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Contestants first.

1737
01:55:00,949 --> 01:55:01,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1738
01:55:01,769 --> 01:55:02,990
[SPEAKER_03]: SnubDisfinoid says...

1739
01:55:04,156 --> 01:55:06,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel was excited to be back from Japan.

1740
01:55:06,758 --> 01:55:17,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Her buddies in Sacto were excited to watch her carry two big bags of souvenirs through the door to her welcome home party, but they were shocked to find that the bags were full of nothing but dead babies covered in feces.

1741
01:55:20,966 --> 01:55:22,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Shame on you, Angel.

1742
01:55:23,527 --> 01:55:24,588
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the babies?

1743
01:55:26,749 --> 01:55:32,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Skyline, DC 505, says two bags full of nothing but Pocari Sweat.

1744
01:55:33,544 --> 01:55:34,224
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that Pocari Sweat?

1745
01:55:34,245 --> 01:55:38,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is kind of ironic because in reality, yeah, she did bring a little Pocari Sweat.

1746
01:55:40,729 --> 01:55:41,410
[SPEAKER_19]: I have my answer.

1747
01:55:41,910 --> 01:55:44,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's go around the room and see if we have any matches.

1748
01:55:44,091 --> 01:55:45,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, what was your answer?

1749
01:55:45,733 --> 01:55:51,216
[SPEAKER_19]: Two bags full of... Two bags full of nothing but metal collars and tickets to a deserted island.

1750
01:55:51,457 --> 01:55:54,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal collars and tickets to a deserted island.

1751
01:55:54,499 --> 01:55:55,920
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, it's not a match.

1752
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:57,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on.

1753
01:55:58,081 --> 01:55:59,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel and Magus, what did you guys come up with?

1754
01:56:00,003 --> 01:56:02,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, so it would be kind of cheating for Angel to answer this one.

1755
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:04,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.

1756
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:05,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Bags full of what else?

1757
01:56:06,061 --> 01:56:06,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Propel.

1758
01:56:07,021 --> 01:56:07,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Propel!

1759
01:56:08,321 --> 01:56:10,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Very close, but not a match.

1760
01:56:10,122 --> 01:56:10,582
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, stop it!

1761
01:56:10,702 --> 01:56:11,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Dammit.

1762
01:56:11,242 --> 01:56:12,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a match, sorry.

1763
01:56:12,362 --> 01:56:14,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Puppy, two bags full of?

1764
01:56:14,723 --> 01:56:15,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Yaoi.

1765
01:56:15,543 --> 01:56:16,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Yaoi!

1766
01:56:18,544 --> 01:56:19,705
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm sorry.

1767
01:56:21,725 --> 01:56:23,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Loki, two bags full of?

1768
01:56:23,966 --> 01:56:25,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Iraqi suicide bombers.

1769
01:56:27,927 --> 01:56:30,068
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know where you can find those in Japan, but whatever.

1770
01:56:30,468 --> 01:56:31,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, zero.

1771
01:56:32,188 --> 01:56:32,869
[SPEAKER_03]: They're out there.

1772
01:56:32,889 --> 01:56:34,069
[SPEAKER_19]: You get them out of vending machines.

1773
01:56:35,612 --> 01:56:36,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Zero.

1774
01:56:36,293 --> 01:56:36,953
[SPEAKER_06]: They're imported.

1775
01:56:38,294 --> 01:56:40,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Unlucky and super lucky weapons to distribute randomly.

1776
01:56:41,196 --> 01:56:43,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Unlucky and super lucky weapons to distribute randomly.

1777
01:56:43,617 --> 01:56:44,518
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm sorry.

1778
01:56:44,678 --> 01:56:49,421
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I was going to say the same thing as Jamie, but I knew that she was going to say something about royale reality.

1779
01:56:49,762 --> 01:56:51,303
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went with the other great import.

1780
01:56:51,643 --> 01:56:54,765
[SPEAKER_02]: A bag full of Chairman Kaga's uniform from Iron Chef.

1781
01:56:56,766 --> 01:56:57,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Iron Chef uniform.

1782
01:56:57,847 --> 01:56:58,087
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1783
01:56:58,147 --> 01:56:59,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's put used underwear.

1784
01:56:59,668 --> 01:57:03,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say soiled panties, but then, you know, I thought some people might take that the wrong way.

1785
01:57:05,892 --> 01:57:09,274
[SPEAKER_03]: My answer is she brought in two bags full of hentai.

1786
01:57:10,234 --> 01:57:10,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1787
01:57:12,555 --> 01:57:13,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a match.

1788
01:57:13,655 --> 01:57:14,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1789
01:57:14,756 --> 01:57:15,076
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1790
01:57:15,936 --> 01:57:26,121
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the scores... The score... That is awful.

1791
01:57:26,861 --> 01:57:28,702
[SPEAKER_03]: I am so glad that it didn't get picked up on the mic.

1792
01:57:28,762 --> 01:57:29,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.

1793
01:57:31,123 --> 01:57:32,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I never said they were adults.

1794
01:57:32,903 --> 01:57:33,964
[SPEAKER_08]: They could be babies.

1795
01:57:35,871 --> 01:57:37,512
[SPEAKER_03]: You are an awful... No, no point.

1796
01:57:37,532 --> 01:57:38,272
[SPEAKER_08]: God is great!

1797
01:57:38,572 --> 01:57:40,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Saddam will... Yeah.

1798

[SPEAKER_03]: Next question.

1803
01:57:47,977 --> 01:57:51,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Why am I getting an answer already to a question that hasn't been asked?

1804
01:57:51,299 --> 01:57:54,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Loki is worse than I. Yes, yes he is.

1808
01:58:00,593 --> 01:58:02,034
[SPEAKER_03]: I should say Antal, too, because he's here.

1809
01:58:02,194 --> 01:58:03,675
[SPEAKER_03]: So, what's up?

1810
01:58:03,915 --> 01:58:11,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Because all three of us are getting very irritated at the shitty service provided to Sakbomani.com by the incompetent web hosts at $1hosting.com.

1811
01:58:12,219 --> 01:58:12,719
[SPEAKER_19]: Bitches.

1812
01:58:13,219 --> 01:58:16,341

01:58:47,251 --> 01:58:48,472
That's a good one.

1817
01:59:12,587 --> 01:59:13,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're going to do that, too.

1818
01:59:15,149 --> 01:59:17,310
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to get a point just for that answer.

1819
01:59:17,370 --> 01:59:17,670
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1820
01:59:19,631 --> 01:59:20,691

[SPEAKER_03]: All right, here we go.

1822
01:59:22,252 --> 01:59:28,235

[SPEAKER_03]: Here's another brilliant one.

1827
01:59:37,965 --> 01:59:38,926
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the one I was laughing at.

1828
01:59:39,306 --> 01:59:43,070
[SPEAKER_03]: SnubDisanoid says, shitty magazines from March Madness.

1829
01:59:46,369 --> 01:59:49,511
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a big box of old video game magazines you were giving away.

1830
01:59:49,611 --> 01:59:50,532
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great answer.

1831
01:59:50,552 --> 01:59:51,533
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking genius.

1832
01:59:51,613 --> 01:59:53,254

[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go, Jamie.

1834
01:59:56,156 --> 01:59:57,557
[SPEAKER_19]: I would send them in a box.

1835
01:59:58,638 --> 02:00:03,081
[SPEAKER_19]: The severed heads belonging to their head tech with a grenade in his mouth.

1836
02:00:03,981 --> 02:00:04,502

[SPEAKER_03]: It's a match.

1920
02:04:39,415 --> 02:04:40,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're Korean Funyuns.

1921
02:04:40,916 --> 02:04:43,178
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Skyline gets a point.

1922

[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm sorry.

1931
02:04:55,548 --> 02:04:56,168
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a match.

1932
02:04:57,029 --> 02:04:57,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Puppy.

1933
02:04:57,629 --> 02:04:58,911
[SPEAKER_09]: They wouldn't sell Yowie that cheap.

1934
02:05:01,733 --> 02:05:02,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Puppy, he went straight for the...

1935
02:05:04,494 --> 02:05:07,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Those two preteen bimbos that were following him around at March Madness.

1936
02:05:08,016 --> 02:05:10,498
[SPEAKER_03]: The teen bimbos that were following him around at March Madness.

1937
02:05:10,518 --> 02:05:11,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, that's not a man.

1938
02:05:11,358 --> 02:05:12,179
[SPEAKER_03]: They were that cheap.

1939
02:05:12,779 --> 02:05:15,401
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, they were checking you out more than they were checking out me.

1940
02:05:15,481 --> 02:05:16,662
[SPEAKER_06]: So, have a good day.

1941
02:05:17,042 --> 02:05:17,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, man.

[SPEAKER_08]: Went straight for the... Okay, now the original answer of Iraqi Suicide Babies is now being replaced with Funion Flavored Pringles.

1944
02:05:31,653 --> 02:05:32,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Funyun-flavored Pringles.

1945
02:05:33,254 --> 02:05:34,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a match, you guys?

1946
02:05:34,315 --> 02:05:34,515
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1947
02:05:35,095 --> 02:05:35,435
[SPEAKER_03]: No?

1948
02:05:35,455 --> 02:05:36,996
[SPEAKER_03]: They're Pringles, not Funyuns.

1949
02:05:37,657 --> 02:05:39,198
[SPEAKER_03]: They're Pringles, not Funyuns.

1950
02:05:39,938 --> 02:05:40,658
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're not rings.

1951
02:05:40,759 --> 02:05:41,399
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, fine.

1952
02:05:41,419 --> 02:05:42,139
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not a match.

1953
02:05:42,179 --> 02:05:42,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

1954
02:05:42,660 --> 02:05:45,722
[SPEAKER_03]: We already kind of had to stretch it to get the last one, so... All right.

1955
02:05:46,422 --> 02:05:47,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Zero.

1956
02:05:47,403 --> 02:05:48,343
[SPEAKER_03]: What did Zero go straight for?

1957
02:05:50,191 --> 02:05:52,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Shining Explosive Necklaces to get out of this game.

1958
02:05:52,472 --> 02:05:54,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Shining Explosive Necklaces to get out of this game.

1959
02:05:54,653 --> 02:05:55,674
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, that's not a match.

1960
02:05:56,854 --> 02:06:00,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave filling in for Shibam.

1961
02:06:02,036 --> 02:06:02,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I can.

1962
02:06:03,597 --> 02:06:03,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave?

1963
02:06:04,237 --> 02:06:07,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, he went straight for the neck of the cashier that was working there.

1964
02:06:08,219 --> 02:06:09,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Straight for the neck of the cashier.

1965
02:06:11,781 --> 02:06:13,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, straight for the neck of the cashier.

1966
02:06:13,982 --> 02:06:15,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, the bagger was worse.

1967
02:06:15,622 --> 02:06:16,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, my answer...

1968
02:06:18,303 --> 02:06:19,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Zero is such a silly intern.

1969
02:06:19,844 --> 02:06:28,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Last night when he was asked to go help shop for snacks, his friends were surprised when they walked into the 99 cent store that Zero went straight for the 99 cent hookers.

1970
02:06:30,473 --> 02:06:33,976
[SPEAKER_03]: God, nobody said, nobody said 99 cent hookers.

1971
02:06:34,276 --> 02:06:34,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1972
02:06:36,398 --> 02:06:39,300
[SPEAKER_03]: One point for Skyline, no points for Snub Dismoyed.

1973
02:06:39,320 --> 02:06:40,441
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's your chance to catch up.

1974
02:06:41,762 --> 02:06:42,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Two questions to go.

1975
02:06:43,603 --> 02:06:44,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here we go.

1976
02:06:45,725 --> 02:06:46,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Next question.

1977
02:06:48,416 --> 02:06:55,737
[SPEAKER_03]: The March Madness tournament in Sacramento was such a great success, but a special message to all those of you that came out and participated.

1978
02:06:56,298 --> 02:06:59,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Next time, please don't make us clean up your blank.

1979
02:07:04,639 --> 02:07:11,020
[SPEAKER_03]: The March Madness tournament in Sacramento was such a great success, but a special message to all those of you that came out and participated.

1980
02:07:11,420 --> 02:07:14,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Next time, please don't make us clean up your blank.

1981
02:07:16,588 --> 02:07:22,553
March Madness Tournament Sacramento, great success, but special message, next time, please don't make us clean up your blank.

1982
02:07:22,673 --> 02:07:23,213
Alright.

02:07:23,233 --> 02:07:24,774
Very simple answer, locked in.

1984
02:07:49,790 --> 02:07:50,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Waiting on one more.

1985
02:07:51,132 --> 02:07:52,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Waiting on one more contestant.

1986
02:07:53,396 --> 02:07:56,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Next time, please don't make us clean up your blank.

1987
02:07:56,120 --> 02:07:59,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Are all the celebrities locked in?

1988
02:08:00,027 --> 02:08:00,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1989
02:08:00,668 --> 02:08:01,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

1990
02:08:01,269 --> 02:08:01,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, puppy's almost done.

1991
02:08:05,516 --> 02:08:05,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1992
02:08:07,097 --> 02:08:07,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Puppy, you in?

1993
02:08:09,258 --> 02:08:20,644
[SPEAKER_03]: He's writing, he's writing, he's writing, writing, writing, still writing, writing, and, and, and, he is almost done.

1994
02:08:21,124 --> 02:08:21,404
[SPEAKER_03]: He's done.

1995
02:08:21,444 --> 02:08:22,005
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, there he goes.

1996
02:08:22,025 --> 02:08:22,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Put it down.

1997
02:08:22,385 --> 02:08:22,745
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1998
02:08:24,026 --> 02:08:25,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, did they send new answers?

1999
02:08:25,886 --> 02:08:26,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, fine.

2000
02:08:26,927 --> 02:08:27,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here we go.

2001
02:08:27,587 --> 02:08:28,388
[SPEAKER_03]: The contestant said...

2002
02:08:29,028 --> 02:08:34,013
[SPEAKER_03]: The March Madness Tournament in Sacramento was such a great success, but a special message to all those of you that came out and participated.

2003
02:08:34,414 --> 02:08:37,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Next time, please don't make us clean up your... Snubdisfanoid says, poop.

2004
02:08:39,419 --> 02:08:40,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't make us clean up your poop.

2005
02:08:42,082 --> 02:08:44,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Skyline says, please don't make us clean up your crap.

2006
02:08:46,826 --> 02:08:49,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a... Now, there is a difference between crap and poop.

2007
02:08:49,849 --> 02:08:50,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Poop...

2008
02:08:50,956 --> 02:08:52,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Crap could be anything.

2009
02:08:52,197 --> 02:08:56,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Crap could actually mean crap, or crap could mean like your stuff that you left running around.

2010
02:08:56,621 --> 02:08:57,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Poop is pretty narrow.

2011
02:08:58,103 --> 02:09:00,685
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only one thing that could be considered poop.

2012
02:09:01,406 --> 02:09:05,470
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends, you know, well there's several animals that could have pooped, but you know, poop is poop.

2013
02:09:05,690 --> 02:09:10,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Crap could be poop, plus several other things, so I think Skyline has the edge on this, but we'll see, we'll see.

2014
02:09:11,295 --> 02:09:12,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go around and see the answers.

2015
02:09:13,697 --> 02:09:14,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie?

2016
02:09:14,881 --> 02:09:20,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Please, next time, don't make us clean up your... Blood from their jugular veins is their collagen's blood.

2017
02:09:25,826 --> 02:09:26,286
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2018
02:09:28,247 --> 02:09:30,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel and Magus, Angel and Magus, here we go, your answer.

[SPEAKER_03]: Cake pie.

2021
02:09:35,310 --> 02:09:36,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't make us clean up your cake pie.

2022
02:09:38,431 --> 02:09:38,932
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2023
02:09:41,493 --> 02:09:41,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Puppy.

2024
02:09:44,051 --> 02:09:46,576
[SPEAKER_09]: All the empty boxes of food from down the street.

2025
02:09:47,277 --> 02:09:49,642
[SPEAKER_03]: All the empty boxes of food from down the street.

2026
02:09:50,183 --> 02:09:51,084
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a true answer.

2027
02:09:51,725 --> 02:09:55,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Loki, please don't make us clean up your... I've got yellow fever.

2028
02:09:58,663 --> 02:09:59,244
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my answer.

2029
02:09:59,484 --> 02:10:00,305
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, Loki?

2030
02:10:00,325 --> 02:10:02,687
[SPEAKER_03]: That would have been twice as funny if you'd used SARS.

2031
02:10:03,468 --> 02:10:03,988
[SPEAKER_03]: But you didn't.

2032
02:10:04,529 --> 02:10:05,029
[SPEAKER_03]: SARS?

2033
02:10:05,249 --> 02:10:07,472
[SPEAKER_03]: That disease in Asia that's going on in the world.

2034
02:10:08,873 --> 02:10:09,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost.

2035
02:10:09,453 --> 02:10:09,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost.

2036
02:10:10,014 --> 02:10:10,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2037
02:10:10,414 --> 02:10:12,657
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a joke from the... You can't see.

2038
02:10:13,718 --> 02:10:14,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on.

2039
02:10:14,578 --> 02:10:14,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Zero.

2040
02:10:17,099 --> 02:10:21,481
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, don't make us clean up your shitty shorts after the judges review a new one.

2041
02:10:21,861 --> 02:10:24,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Shitty shorts after the judges review a new one, isn't that lovely?

2042
02:10:25,262 --> 02:10:26,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Lo and behold, what was my answer?

2043
02:10:26,883 --> 02:10:28,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't make us clean up your crap!

2044
02:10:29,184 --> 02:10:30,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't make us clean up your crap!

2045
02:10:30,484 --> 02:10:31,305
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to, damn it!

2046
02:10:31,425 --> 02:10:36,147
[SPEAKER_03]: You said crap, that is an exact match, an exact match with Skyline, beautiful.

2047
02:10:38,288 --> 02:10:41,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's 2-0, well let's see if SnubDisco can catch up here.

2048
02:10:42,790 --> 02:10:46,131
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, please don't make us clean up your sweat.

2049
02:10:48,177 --> 02:10:51,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you guys sweat a lot when you play DDR and you need to wear deodorant.

2050
02:10:51,378 --> 02:10:51,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2051
02:10:54,558 --> 02:10:54,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2052
02:10:56,619 --> 02:11:00,380
[SPEAKER_03]: So, two points for Skyline and no points for Snub.

2053
02:11:00,460 --> 02:11:01,240
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's okay, Snub.

02:11:01,260 --> 02:11:01,840

02:11:55,406 --> 02:11:56,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, excellent answer.

2066
02:11:56,667 --> 02:11:58,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent, excellent answer from that contestant.

2067
02:12:00,549 --> 02:12:02,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Too bad we're not as smart as the contestants.

2068
02:12:05,512 --> 02:12:11,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I think... Okay, fair enough.

2069
02:12:11,576 --> 02:12:12,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Good answer from both people.

2070

[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

[SPEAKER_03]: Are you guys done over here, tag team?

2075
02:12:25,446 --> 02:12:27,847
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, suddenly Angel's looking more and more attractive.

2076
02:12:30,248 --> 02:12:30,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

2077
02:12:30,488 --> 02:12:32,868

[SPEAKER_03]: Don't, okay, here we go.

02:12:46,907 --> 02:12:48,248
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my favorite thing the angel does.

02:12:49,328 --> 02:12:49,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't!

2085
02:12:50,629 --> 02:12:51,869
[SPEAKER_18]: I hate you just as once.

2086
02:12:52,590 --> 02:12:53,610
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you hurt like that much?

2087
02:12:56,331 --> 02:12:57,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Ow, that hurt!

02:13:04,218 --> 02:13:05,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Snub's got to catch up, and here's his answer.

2092
02:13:06,339 --> 02:13:09,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie won the Bomani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night.

2093
02:13:09,201 --> 02:13:12,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Her secret weapon was her remote collar exploder dealie.

2094
02:13:13,783 --> 02:13:14,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Good answer.

2095
02:13:15,564 --> 02:13:15,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2096
02:13:16,324 --> 02:13:20,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie won the Bomani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night.

2097
02:13:20,727 --> 02:13:26,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Her secret weapon was her Skyline says... Oh, he changed his answer.

2098
02:13:26,650 --> 02:13:28,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I think his first answer was better.

2099
02:13:28,712 --> 02:13:33,837
[SPEAKER_03]: He said Orange Bat, which is a great answer, but he changed it.

2100
02:13:33,917 --> 02:13:35,618
[SPEAKER_03]: His new answer is Boomstick.

2101
02:13:37,380 --> 02:13:40,442
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have Remote, Collar, Exploder, Dealey, and Boomstick.

2102
02:13:41,363 --> 02:13:43,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Jamie, what's your answer?

2103
02:13:43,325 --> 02:13:43,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Bat.

2104
02:13:43,945 --> 02:13:44,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Bat!

2105
02:13:46,327 --> 02:13:47,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew it, too!

2106
02:13:48,068 --> 02:13:50,728
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, you're already in the lead, Skyline, you don't need it.

2107
02:13:51,569 --> 02:13:54,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, as Snub goes, yes, I still have a chance!

2108
02:13:54,229 --> 02:13:56,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, our tag team, lovely tag team of Magus and Angel.

2109
02:13:57,130 --> 02:13:57,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Big.

2110
02:13:57,791 --> 02:13:58,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Black.

2111
02:13:58,531 --> 02:13:58,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Cock.

2112
02:13:59,111 --> 02:14:00,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Her big black cock!

2113
02:14:00,471 --> 02:14:01,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Dun dun dun!

2114
02:14:03,672 --> 02:14:04,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, that's not a match.

2115
02:14:05,113 --> 02:14:05,533
[SPEAKER_03]: But funny.

2116
02:14:06,193 --> 02:14:06,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Puppy.

2117
02:14:08,034 --> 02:14:08,894
[SPEAKER_03]: The ferret!

2118
02:14:09,254 --> 02:14:10,014
[SPEAKER_03]: The ferret!

2119
02:14:11,015 --> 02:14:12,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Good answer, but not a match.

2120
02:14:16,541 --> 02:14:25,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, her secret weapon was her Iraqi suicide babies.

2121
02:14:25,888 --> 02:14:27,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Iraqi suicide babies.

2122
02:14:27,769 --> 02:14:28,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie, is this true?

2123
02:14:30,511 --> 02:14:31,132
[SPEAKER_19]: I admit it.

2124
02:14:31,512 --> 02:14:32,613
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been exporting them.

2125
02:14:32,733 --> 02:14:34,354
[SPEAKER_19]: I keep them in my trunk.

2126
02:14:36,736 --> 02:14:37,757
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, in your trunks.

2127
02:14:37,977 --> 02:14:39,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear God, what about the children?

2128
02:14:39,178 --> 02:14:39,818
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the children?

2129
02:14:39,878 --> 02:14:41,199
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, moving on.

2130
02:14:41,259 --> 02:14:41,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Zero.

2131
02:14:42,060 --> 02:14:42,760
[SPEAKER_19]: Her paper plate.

2132
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:44,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Her paper plate, the real answer.

2133
02:14:46,269 --> 02:14:46,909
[SPEAKER_03]: The true one.

2134
02:14:47,389 --> 02:14:48,109
[SPEAKER_19]: And the magic marker.

2135
02:14:49,030 --> 02:14:49,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2136
02:14:53,771 --> 02:14:56,071
[SPEAKER_06]: And the damn candlestick she jabbed me in the head with.

2137
02:14:56,991 --> 02:14:57,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2138
02:14:57,471 --> 02:14:59,472
[SPEAKER_02]: In the study with Colonel Mustard.

2139
02:15:00,372 --> 02:15:01,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

2140
02:15:02,292 --> 02:15:04,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave, who's filling in for Shiva.

2141
02:15:04,653 --> 02:15:08,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, her secret weapon was her extremely high-pitched voice.

2142
02:15:08,994 --> 02:15:09,534
I hear it!

2143
02:15:09,614 --> 02:15:10,734
It's mine!

2144
02:15:10,794 --> 02:15:11,434
Do it!

2145
02:15:11,454 --> 02:15:11,794
[SPEAKER_19]: Do it!

2146
02:15:11,814 --> 02:15:11,954
[SPEAKER_19]: No!

2147
02:15:18,357 --> 02:15:19,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Shatter, shatter, shatter.

2148
02:15:20,757 --> 02:15:25,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised, that reminds me of a story you told me earlier this week, and I'm surprised it was not your FU of the week.

2149
02:15:26,619 --> 02:15:27,219
[SPEAKER_03]: You bitch.

2150
02:15:27,979 --> 02:15:31,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyway, my answer, yeah, I got carrot.

2151
02:15:32,900 --> 02:15:36,620
[SPEAKER_02]: For the record, Jamie does sound like a younger person on the phone.

2152
02:15:36,700 --> 02:15:37,781
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, fuck you.

2153
02:15:38,941 --> 02:15:41,121
[SPEAKER_19]: I have to get to that, I have to do another fuck you after this.

2154
02:15:41,561 --> 02:15:42,061
[SPEAKER_03]: After the break.

2155
02:15:48,396 --> 02:15:49,057
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

2156
02:15:50,058 --> 02:15:52,400
[SPEAKER_03]: It just goes to show that looks can be deceiving.

2157
02:15:53,661 --> 02:15:54,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Because she's pure evil.

2158
02:15:56,824 --> 02:15:57,625
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, my answer.

2159
02:15:57,965 --> 02:15:59,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's finish this damn thing up.

2160
02:15:59,626 --> 02:16:01,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Only three people are going to get this joke.

2161
02:16:02,789 --> 02:16:06,252
[SPEAKER_03]: But I said Jamie won because of her cock snacks.

2162
02:16:09,696 --> 02:16:10,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Cock snacks.

2163
02:16:11,758 --> 02:16:12,178
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2164
02:16:14,835 --> 02:16:16,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Skyline, two points.

2165
02:16:16,156 --> 02:16:17,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Snub, zero points.

2166
02:16:17,357 --> 02:16:18,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Skyline is the winner!

2167
02:16:18,937 --> 02:16:19,798
Yay!

2168
02:16:21,059 --> 02:16:22,760
[SPEAKER_03]: And what does Skyline win, Jamie?

2169
02:16:24,280 --> 02:16:24,941
[SPEAKER_19]: This carrot.

2170
02:16:26,282 --> 02:16:27,182
[SPEAKER_03]: That you just ate.

2171
02:16:29,043 --> 02:16:30,384
[SPEAKER_19]: You win a shiny new collar.

2172
02:16:33,286 --> 02:16:35,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2173
02:16:38,088 --> 02:16:38,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2174
02:16:39,669 --> 02:16:41,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, it's... Nice to meet you.

2175
02:16:43,211 --> 02:16:47,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a call from a telemarketer yesterday after I had been in a wonderful mood.

2176
02:17:12,112 --> 02:17:15,694
[SPEAKER_19]: and, and I, I answered him, hi!

2177
02:17:16,214 --> 02:17:17,574
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, like I always do when I'm really happy.

2178
02:17:19,575 --> 02:17:22,156
[SPEAKER_19]: And I was, it's like, hi, can I speak to your mommy?

2179
02:17:23,597 --> 02:17:28,139
[SPEAKER_19]: My response is, fuck you, you go die, you motherfucker.

2180
02:17:28,839 --> 02:17:30,120
[SPEAKER_19]: No, you can't talk to my mother.

2181
02:17:32,121 --> 02:17:35,042
[SPEAKER_19]: And, I was like my number one pet peeve, okay?

2182
02:17:35,802 --> 02:17:37,103
[SPEAKER_19]: And so, um, he was like,

2183
02:17:38,425 --> 02:17:39,166
[SPEAKER_19]: What are you, 12?

2184
02:17:39,226 --> 02:17:40,527
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that any way for a little girl to talk?

2185
02:17:40,547 --> 02:17:41,268
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me speak to your mother.

2186
02:17:41,829 --> 02:17:45,372
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm like, like, what did I say?

2187
02:17:46,193 --> 02:17:48,496
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh yeah, go to hell and opt me out.

2188
02:17:48,596 --> 02:17:49,257
[SPEAKER_19]: And hung up on him.

2189
02:17:50,298 --> 02:17:53,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Opt me out being the way that, you know, they don't call you back.

2190
02:17:53,561 --> 02:17:54,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Those who don't know.

2191
02:17:54,262 --> 02:17:56,444
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to get rid of a telemarketer, ask them to opt you out.

2192
02:17:58,927 --> 02:18:00,348
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Storytime with Jamie, everybody.

2193
02:18:00,388 --> 02:18:00,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

2194
02:18:02,711 --> 02:18:06,113
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm really not that bad with telemarketers because Dan had to do that for a little while.

2195
02:18:06,433 --> 02:18:14,319
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm really patient with them usually, but that is my number one pet peeve is people tell him, you remember it on Under Sedation?

2196
02:18:15,500 --> 02:18:15,920
[SPEAKER_19]: All of you.

2197
02:18:16,200 --> 02:18:18,902
[SPEAKER_19]: So you get a fuck you too, but not recently.

2198
02:18:18,942 --> 02:18:20,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you should have done this, you man.

2199
02:18:20,343 --> 02:18:21,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, hold on just one sec.

2200
02:18:22,045 --> 02:18:22,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

2201
02:18:23,225 --> 02:18:24,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, fuck yourself in.

2202
02:18:24,386 --> 02:18:24,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck me up.

2203
02:18:26,733 --> 02:18:27,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'll put it this way.

2204
02:18:27,694 --> 02:18:34,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you guys hate telemarketers, but I remember when I had to do telemarketing, we hate it more than you guys hate us having to do it.

2205
02:18:35,383 --> 02:18:40,810
[SPEAKER_06]: It's totally tedious work, and it's stupid, and people hate you because you have to call them, but that's your job.

2206
02:18:41,631 --> 02:18:44,835
[SPEAKER_06]: And it really sucks ass.

2207
02:18:45,115 --> 02:18:45,836
[SPEAKER_06]: He was rude, though.

2208
02:18:46,456 --> 02:18:46,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2209
02:18:47,293 --> 02:18:54,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, it was just like, you know, like, we hate doing it more than you guys hate us calling you at 6 o'clock, right, when you're in the middle of dinner.

2210
02:18:54,738 --> 02:19:00,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, the best time is when you're calling, when people are saying grace for dinner, because you'll hear Jesus Christ come out of their mouth.

2211
02:19:01,442 --> 02:19:02,442
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the best thing ever.

2212
02:19:03,243 --> 02:19:03,463
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

2213
02:19:05,144 --> 02:19:06,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Or after they're done watching The Ring.

2214
02:19:06,985 --> 02:19:07,846
[SPEAKER_19]: No, no, no.

2215
02:19:09,073 --> 02:19:11,074
[SPEAKER_19]: Normally, like I said, I'm fine with telemarketers.

2216
02:19:11,114 --> 02:19:13,254
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm normally, you know, just fine as I can be with them.

2217
02:19:13,895 --> 02:19:16,415
[SPEAKER_19]: But that, I don't sound like I'm 12.

2218
02:19:16,956 --> 02:19:18,216
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know how I sound like I'm 12.

2219
02:19:18,536 --> 02:19:19,316
[SPEAKER_19]: Even when I'm happy.

2220
02:19:20,197 --> 02:19:21,317
[SPEAKER_19]: Do I sound like I'm 12 when I'm happy?

2221
02:19:21,337 --> 02:19:23,258
[SPEAKER_19]: Shut up, Robbie.

2222
02:19:23,658 --> 02:19:25,118
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't say a goddamn thing.

2223
02:19:25,158 --> 02:19:26,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just looking at you.

2224
02:19:26,939 --> 02:19:27,859
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm gonna go now.

2225
02:19:27,919 --> 02:19:28,479
[SPEAKER_19]: I have to go back.

2226
02:19:30,260 --> 02:19:31,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie's gonna go make a gift.

2227
02:19:31,480 --> 02:19:34,221
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the meantime, we're gonna play some gifts for you.

02:26:05,253 --> 02:26:06,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Shaving monkeys is always permitted.

2256
02:26:07,897 --> 02:26:08,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kidding.

2257
02:26:08,619 --> 02:26:09,079
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

2258
02:26:09,927 --> 02:26:11,328
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll just bring Shermie.

2259
02:26:11,468 --> 02:26:12,549
[SPEAKER_19]: If Shermie doesn't like you, leave.

2260
02:26:12,569 --> 02:26:15,211
[SPEAKER_08]: As always, we're brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.

2261
02:26:35,993 --> 02:26:36,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

2262
02:26:37,153 --> 02:26:37,633
[SPEAKER_03]: We're back.

2263
02:26:38,533 --> 02:26:41,074
[SPEAKER_03]: And that music means it's time for Ask Orange Lounge.

2264
02:26:43,854 --> 02:26:45,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you can ask one of our guests.

2265
02:26:45,155 --> 02:26:48,155
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've only gotten two questions so far, so we need more questions.

2266
02:26:48,935 --> 02:26:51,036
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're listening, for the love of God, submit a question.

2267
02:26:51,456 --> 02:26:52,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Puppy, you're leaving?

2268
02:26:52,216 --> 02:26:53,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're getting a ride to Davis and Towel?

2269
02:26:54,556 --> 02:26:54,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

2270
02:26:55,236 --> 02:26:56,077
[SPEAKER_03]: One less person I have to take home.

2271
02:26:56,097 --> 02:26:56,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

2272
02:26:57,457 --> 02:26:57,737
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2273
02:26:58,517 --> 02:26:59,997
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you, puppy.

2274
02:27:00,857 --> 02:27:01,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

2275
02:27:01,257 --> 02:27:01,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2276
02:27:03,638 --> 02:27:03,938
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2277
02:27:05,993 --> 02:27:06,954
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want, that'd be awesome.

2278
02:27:07,415 --> 02:27:07,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2279
02:27:08,255 --> 02:27:08,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2280
02:27:11,078 --> 02:27:13,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I really don't want to because it's just so much.

2281
02:27:13,160 --> 02:27:13,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, okay.

2282
02:27:13,581 --> 02:27:14,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, anyway.

2283
02:27:14,442 --> 02:27:14,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2284
02:27:15,042 --> 02:27:16,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Ask Orange Lounge time.

2285
02:27:17,164 --> 02:27:20,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, before I get to Ask Orange Lounge, I'll give people time to submit more questions for anybody.

2286
02:27:21,863 --> 02:27:23,844
[SPEAKER_03]: You can ask Angel, who's just been to Japan.

2287
02:27:23,864 --> 02:27:25,205
[SPEAKER_03]: You can ask her about something she saw there.

2288
02:27:25,245 --> 02:27:27,966
[SPEAKER_03]: You can ask Angel and Megas personal questions.

2289
02:27:29,007 --> 02:27:31,328
[SPEAKER_03]: You can ask Joe about his routine.

2290
02:27:31,388 --> 02:27:34,069
[SPEAKER_03]: You can ask Loki about why he's such a bastard.

2291
02:27:34,449 --> 02:27:38,411
[SPEAKER_03]: You can ask Zero about Xerox or whatever.

2292
02:27:38,471 --> 02:27:41,213
[SPEAKER_03]: You can ask Anita about being cute.

2293
02:27:45,895 --> 02:27:48,657
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to comment on her quote yesterday in the chatroom.

2294
02:27:48,697 --> 02:27:49,277
[SPEAKER_18]: It ruled.

2295
02:27:51,468 --> 02:27:52,488
[SPEAKER_18]: You can read that off, by the way.

2296
02:27:54,729 --> 02:27:57,990
[SPEAKER_03]: The quote was, bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity.

2297
02:27:58,410 --> 02:27:59,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I want to say hello to Jonas.

2298
02:27:59,791 --> 02:28:01,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk to Jonas for a bit while people are submitting questions.

2299
02:28:01,951 --> 02:28:02,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it a minute.

2300
02:28:02,911 --> 02:28:03,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Jonas, how you doing?

2301
02:28:03,932 --> 02:28:04,532
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm doing okay.

2302
02:28:04,552 --> 02:28:05,712
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't get to talk to you about the tournament.

2303
02:28:06,032 --> 02:28:06,813
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you feel about it?

2304
02:28:07,353 --> 02:28:07,813
[SPEAKER_03]: March Madness.

2305
02:28:08,273 --> 02:28:14,715
[SPEAKER_25]: First of all, I felt this was the best tournament I've ever participated in.

2306
02:28:14,735 --> 02:28:15,875
[SPEAKER_25]: Everything was all set up right.

2307
02:28:17,556 --> 02:28:18,476
[SPEAKER_25]: Especially for PA.

2308
02:28:19,717 --> 02:28:21,137
[SPEAKER_25]: Though, some people were complaining about

2309
02:28:21,826 --> 02:28:24,070
[SPEAKER_25]: About having a 10-footer, you know what he said, any song?

2310
02:28:24,110 --> 02:28:24,210
Yep.

2311
02:28:27,293 --> 02:28:31,614
[SPEAKER_25]: I think some people should, um, were complaining about putting, make it no 10-footers.

2312
02:28:31,634 --> 02:28:33,915
[SPEAKER_25]: The score was like the easiest 10-footer of all time.

2313
02:28:34,355 --> 02:28:39,357
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's interesting, though, is that, um, the way Mike seeded is he didn't seed it just by score.

2314
02:28:39,437 --> 02:28:44,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people that got, that screwed up their combos on bag and stuff got seeded lower.

2315
02:28:44,119 --> 02:28:50,081
[SPEAKER_03]: If they got more than like 50 grades, he threw them in the bottom, saying, you know what, don't do that shit, which is pretty cool.

2316
02:28:50,621 --> 02:28:51,441
[SPEAKER_25]: I know, I know.

2317
02:28:51,461 --> 02:28:56,063
[SPEAKER_25]: That's why I picked bag, because of what they said about the rules, but, well, it doesn't matter anyways.

2318
02:28:56,083 --> 02:28:56,783
[SPEAKER_25]: They're, they're,

2319
02:28:57,361 --> 02:29:01,525
[SPEAKER_25]: The PA was like so close and everything, especially when you got the one perfect win.

2320
02:29:03,107 --> 02:29:04,889
[SPEAKER_25]: Remember, you won by one perfect win.

2321
02:29:04,969 --> 02:29:06,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2322
02:29:06,631 --> 02:29:17,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, that's the second tournament I've done that at, so I don't... Now this is the thing, I'm being called the... No, it wasn't Loki, it was ShortyMC that I ended up upsetting, and now they're all calling me the upset king.

2323
02:29:17,361 --> 02:29:20,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, how the fuck am I the upset king if I keep winning?

2324
02:29:23,004 --> 02:29:23,585
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm just kidding.

2325
02:29:23,605 --> 02:29:24,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have any ego like that.

2326
02:29:24,968 --> 02:29:28,534
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly, both times, both times was a huge surprise.

2327
02:29:28,554 --> 02:29:29,616
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a huge surprise both times.

2328
02:29:29,636 --> 02:29:31,579
[SPEAKER_25]: And I know who you are.

2329
02:29:32,100 --> 02:29:33,082
[SPEAKER_25]: I think I get...

2330
02:29:34,684 --> 02:29:41,407
[SPEAKER_03]: When you were portrayed as Dr. Dick Oh yes, my alter ego Dr. Dick I know who I am, I know who I am, do you know why?

2331
02:29:42,228 --> 02:29:54,694
[SPEAKER_03]: The video is going to embarrass my mother Video of the actual freestyle routine is out Don't waste your time downloading it It sucks Wait for the whole thing Wait for the official videos that are going to have the whole thing The introduction

2332
02:29:55,354 --> 02:29:58,036
[SPEAKER_03]: and the follow-up, because the routine itself sucks shit.

2333
02:29:58,096 --> 02:30:02,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, as I found out, just moments ago, I came in seventh place.

2334
02:30:02,980 --> 02:30:05,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Dick, I should say Dr. Dick came in seventh place.

2335
02:30:05,662 --> 02:30:12,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Which means, if one of the top six flakes, I'm going to Power Station and I have to do a freestyle.

2336
02:30:14,169 --> 02:30:16,591
[SPEAKER_25]: But, we'll find out what your song is somehow.

2337
02:30:18,330 --> 02:30:21,453
[SPEAKER_25]: And of course, you may not want the improv because this is an actual power station.

2338
02:30:21,473 --> 02:30:23,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it could be a Two-Face person saying, half-sky, half-dick.

2339
02:30:23,796 --> 02:30:24,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, half-spanky, half-dick.

2340
02:30:40,518 --> 02:30:40,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2341
02:30:42,379 --> 02:30:43,019
[SPEAKER_03]: So, anyway.

2342
02:30:45,120 --> 02:30:45,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2343
02:30:45,980 --> 02:30:46,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, the buzz went away for a minute.

2344
02:30:47,380 --> 02:30:47,820
[SPEAKER_03]: And it came back.

2345
02:30:48,921 --> 02:30:49,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2346
02:30:49,921 --> 02:30:51,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time we say, ooh, the buzz went away, it comes back.

2347
02:30:51,542 --> 02:30:51,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2348
02:30:52,102 --> 02:30:55,523
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, March Madness was not the only big tournament that happened.

2349
02:30:55,823 --> 02:30:57,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's the one we've only been talking about.

2350
02:30:58,784 --> 02:30:59,165
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard.

2351
02:31:19,560 --> 02:31:21,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Second place, Dancing Jedi.

2352
02:31:21,881 --> 02:31:23,802
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like the Tigger up there, you know, he wins a tournament.

2353
02:31:23,902 --> 02:31:24,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, surprise!

2354
02:31:24,982 --> 02:31:28,884
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why, oh, if he comes to B3, which I hear he is, it's going to be a great showdown.

2355
02:31:29,244 --> 02:31:29,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes!

2356
02:31:29,824 --> 02:31:31,705
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be beautiful.

2357
02:31:31,725 --> 02:31:31,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2358
02:31:31,885 --> 02:31:32,946
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let Yasuo and Take come.

2359
02:31:33,386 --> 02:31:34,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'll wet my pants.

2360
02:31:34,626 --> 02:31:38,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, third was Unblinking Eye, so congratulations to Top3 in Tech there.

2361
02:31:38,888 --> 02:31:44,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Oni, first place was Dancing Jedi, second place was GPF Lith, and third place was Cynic.

2362
02:31:44,711 --> 02:31:45,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job, you guys.

2363
02:31:46,090 --> 02:31:46,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Challenge.

2364
02:31:46,731 --> 02:31:47,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this is cool.

2365
02:31:47,371 --> 02:31:50,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I am surprised that the Challenge competition has never been ripped off here in NorCal.

2366
02:31:50,994 --> 02:31:51,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wait.

2367
02:31:51,975 --> 02:31:55,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we'll rip that off at the next SAC tournament.

2368
02:31:55,718 --> 02:31:59,761
[SPEAKER_03]: If you remember Challenge from 4th Mix and Extra Mix, they do a competition that's all about that.

2369
02:31:59,781 --> 02:32:01,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, how many goods can you get on this song?

2370
02:32:02,423 --> 02:32:05,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Or how many perfects can you get not looking at it or whatever?

2371
02:32:05,465 --> 02:32:06,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, all this crazy stuff they do.

2372
02:32:06,746 --> 02:32:07,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

2373
02:32:08,467 --> 02:32:09,368
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's interesting.

2374
02:32:09,388 --> 02:32:11,750
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is interesting because the Seattle tournaments, they're all PA.

2375
02:32:11,770 --> 02:32:15,413
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no freestyle because I guess they can't freestyle or whatever.

2376
02:32:15,453 --> 02:32:15,753
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2377
02:32:16,333 --> 02:32:16,834
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know.

2378
02:32:16,854 --> 02:32:18,695
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to prove us wrong at B3, I bet you anything.

2379
02:32:18,736 --> 02:32:22,419
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to all put their heads together and just give this kick-ass freestyle.

2380
02:32:22,439 --> 02:32:23,680
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll just put everything else to shame.

2381
02:32:23,860 --> 02:32:26,122
[SPEAKER_25]: You got people around the U.S.

2382
02:32:26,162 --> 02:32:27,443
[SPEAKER_25]: freestyling hella good.

2383
02:32:27,603 --> 02:32:30,266
[SPEAKER_25]: They get from Omaha, they get from New York.

2384
02:32:31,522 --> 02:32:33,703
[SPEAKER_25]: Hell, it actually can happen.

2385
02:32:33,963 --> 02:32:39,004
[SPEAKER_03]: First place in challenge was Krakoon, second place was Dancing Jedi, and third place was Cynic.

2386
02:32:39,564 --> 02:32:40,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job, you guys.

2387
02:32:40,844 --> 02:32:42,365
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so that was the DDR Magic Tournament.

2388
02:32:42,385 --> 02:32:44,685
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess there was a tournament in Florida, and Tigger won a machine.

2389
02:32:44,765 --> 02:32:45,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, he did.

2390
02:32:45,625 --> 02:32:47,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody was paying attention to that tournament, so they don't get a shout-out.

2391
02:32:47,806 --> 02:32:48,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Tigger wasn't there.

2392
02:32:49,966 --> 02:32:53,287
[SPEAKER_03]: If somebody can give me information on who plays that tournament, I'll gladly read their names.

2393
02:32:53,367 --> 02:32:54,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, get to the Q&A.

2394
02:32:54,928 --> 02:32:56,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Chatroom's demanding we get to the Q&A.

2395
02:32:56,628 --> 02:32:56,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

2396
02:32:57,388 --> 02:32:58,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Booster questions, please.

2397
02:32:58,609 --> 02:33:00,149
[SPEAKER_03]: We start with Rice Princess.

2398
02:33:02,558 --> 02:33:05,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Rice Princess wants to know, what is DJ Taka's real name?

2399
02:33:07,160 --> 02:33:07,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2400
02:33:17,404 --> 02:33:21,208
[SPEAKER_03]: She says she found out already, but we're challenging ourselves now.

2401
02:33:22,889 --> 02:33:26,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Rice Princess has it, but let's see if Loki can find it.

2402
02:33:28,795 --> 02:33:29,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's a game.

2403
02:33:31,518 --> 02:33:38,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we as smart as the chatroom?

2404
02:33:38,985 --> 02:33:39,726
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the answer.

2405
02:33:39,906 --> 02:33:41,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Should I just... Oh, Dark Tetsuya, you know...

2406
02:33:42,932 --> 02:33:44,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Takeyuki Ishikawa.

2407
02:33:45,654 --> 02:33:46,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.

2408
02:33:46,175 --> 02:33:46,635
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

2409
02:33:46,875 --> 02:33:47,996
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what Rice Princess has.

2410
02:33:48,036 --> 02:33:49,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Takeyuki Ishikawa.

2411
02:33:49,818 --> 02:33:50,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.

2412
02:33:52,460 --> 02:33:54,461
[SPEAKER_18]: Angel says hi to Rice Princess, too.

2413
02:33:55,502 --> 02:33:56,383
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, say it, right?

2414
02:33:56,423 --> 02:33:57,664
[SPEAKER_18]: Because Ishikawa is his last name.

2415
02:34:00,646 --> 02:34:01,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye, Joe.

2416
02:34:02,088 --> 02:34:02,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming.

2417
02:34:05,730 --> 02:34:06,111
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm out.

2418
02:34:06,131 --> 02:34:07,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Any final thoughts?

2419
02:34:07,732 --> 02:34:08,413
[SPEAKER_10]: I need a day.

2420
02:34:08,953 --> 02:34:09,353
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2421
02:34:09,634 --> 02:34:09,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2422
02:34:11,243 --> 02:34:16,388
[SPEAKER_08]: But I bet you didn't know that V was co-opted by DJ Taka and Antonio Vivaldi.

2423
02:34:18,129 --> 02:34:20,691
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I kid you not, it's in the case notes.

2424
02:34:21,732 --> 02:34:27,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing as you know Vivaldi is the classic piece that is based off of him.

2425
02:34:27,377 --> 02:34:29,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Vivaldi's, Vivaldi's winter?

2426
02:34:30,040 --> 02:34:30,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

2427
02:34:31,101 --> 02:34:36,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, alright, alright, alright, here we go.

2428
02:34:37,006 --> 02:34:37,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh...

2429
02:34:40,956 --> 02:34:42,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I slept with Mr. Brian once.

2430
02:34:42,417 --> 02:34:43,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here we go.

2431
02:34:43,417 --> 02:34:43,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Shh.

2432
02:34:43,898 --> 02:34:45,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2433
02:34:45,338 --> 02:34:51,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Rice Princess says, What is that white slab in my can of beans?

2434
02:34:52,703 --> 02:34:53,063
[SPEAKER_14]: Pork.

2435
02:34:54,724 --> 02:34:55,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Pork.

2436
02:34:55,705 --> 02:34:56,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Fat.

2437
02:34:57,366 --> 02:34:59,067
[SPEAKER_03]: The other white guy.

2438
02:34:59,107 --> 02:34:59,787
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, Zero?

2439
02:35:00,048 --> 02:35:00,788
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pictures.

2440
02:35:02,029 --> 02:35:04,911
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the other white guy who played Let It Be.

2441
02:35:04,931 --> 02:35:05,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2442
02:35:08,723 --> 02:35:11,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he's influenced by Dark Sakura.

2443
02:35:37,927 --> 02:35:39,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, because we're his friends.

2444
02:35:39,609 --> 02:35:40,770
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why he rules so much.

2445
02:35:40,831 --> 02:35:41,451
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the answer.

2446
02:35:42,132 --> 02:35:43,714
[SPEAKER_03]: He rules so much because we're his friends.

2447
02:35:44,094 --> 02:35:44,395
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2448
02:35:46,057 --> 02:35:53,145
[SPEAKER_03]: SnubDisanoid says, Why, in the name of God, did I have to get two greats on Never Let You Down?

2449
02:35:54,086 --> 02:35:54,767
[SPEAKER_19]: Because you suck.

2450
02:35:56,048 --> 02:35:56,449
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm kidding.

2451
02:35:58,376 --> 02:36:11,261
[SPEAKER_03]: you got two greats, I'll never let you down because you weren't concentrating and next time your neck gets blown off because you had to pee and you can't pee when you have to pee alright, SnubDisanoid also wants to say to Angel

2452
02:36:13,405 --> 02:36:20,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get to ride the, and pardon my white pronunciation of this, Shinkansen, the bullet train?

2453
02:36:20,549 --> 02:36:21,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get to ride the bullet train?

2454
02:36:21,510 --> 02:36:26,473
[SPEAKER_18]: No, but my father and my friend did on the way over to where we were.

2455
02:36:27,273 --> 02:36:27,713
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

2456
02:36:27,873 --> 02:36:28,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get to see it?

2457
02:36:28,454 --> 02:36:29,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get to hear them honk the horn?

2458
02:36:30,555 --> 02:36:31,175
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, no.

2459
02:36:31,495 --> 02:36:32,736
[SPEAKER_18]: We have little trains over there.

2460
02:36:33,056 --> 02:36:35,898
[SPEAKER_18]: They got to see, like, Hiroshima and, you know...

2461
02:36:38,070 --> 02:36:40,353
[SPEAKER_18]: All the little sites while they're coming down.

2462
02:36:40,593 --> 02:36:45,278
[SPEAKER_18]: Except it took them like 10 hours to get to where we were.

2463
02:36:48,002 --> 02:36:49,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and SnubDisanoid says, you know what?

2464
02:36:49,964 --> 02:36:50,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Jamie, you know what?

2465
02:36:51,225 --> 02:36:52,807
[SPEAKER_03]: SnubDisanoid, he did have to pee.

2466
02:36:53,528 --> 02:36:54,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.

2467
02:36:55,954 --> 02:36:57,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Miss Cleo, live in the house.

2468
02:36:57,254 --> 02:36:57,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2469
02:36:59,155 --> 02:37:03,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Justin would like to say, how many people would like these songs in full version?

2470
02:37:03,556 --> 02:37:07,477
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he lists all these fucking songs I'm not going to read, but there's a lot of Judy Crystal.

2471
02:37:07,577 --> 02:37:08,197
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be on tonight.

2472
02:37:08,317 --> 02:37:11,198
[SPEAKER_03]: And Rose, Judy and Priscilla, Maria Short.

2473
02:37:11,738 --> 02:37:12,558
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll be on tonight.

2474
02:37:14,159 --> 02:37:16,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, yeah, of course we want them, you fool.

2475
02:37:16,819 --> 02:37:17,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Send them.

2476
02:37:19,140 --> 02:37:20,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, Rice Princess has another great question.

2477
02:37:21,400 --> 02:37:23,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Haven't any of you seen Ren and Stimpy?

2478
02:37:26,038 --> 02:37:27,520
[SPEAKER_03]: There must have been a reference I missed.

2479
02:37:29,882 --> 02:37:32,705
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all about the brand new episodes on TNN.

2480
02:37:33,165 --> 02:37:33,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that's right.

2481
02:37:33,626 --> 02:37:35,328
[SPEAKER_08]: They bought the rights for it and they're making new episodes.

2482
02:37:36,529 --> 02:37:37,410
[SPEAKER_03]: This is amazing.

2483
02:37:38,170 --> 02:37:41,734
[SPEAKER_03]: For the first time in my life, I watched SpongeBob SquarePants.

2484
02:37:43,156 --> 02:37:44,197
[SPEAKER_19]: Never seen it, never will.

2485
02:37:44,397 --> 02:37:45,498
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty fucking funny.

2486
02:37:45,538 --> 02:37:46,319
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're missing out.

2487
02:37:46,359 --> 02:37:46,979
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty funny.

2488
02:37:47,420 --> 02:37:48,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I was impressed.

2489
02:37:49,466 --> 02:37:49,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Eat me.

2490
02:37:50,146 --> 02:37:50,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2491
02:37:50,526 --> 02:37:53,047
[SPEAKER_19]: You have got me watching Invader Zim now.

2492
02:37:53,807 --> 02:37:53,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

2493
02:37:55,107 --> 02:37:56,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've been downloading them.

2494
02:37:56,528 --> 02:38:06,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Rise Princess says the correct answer to the bean question was, it's the queen bean and the rest are worker beans.

2495
02:38:06,110 --> 02:38:08,691
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember that.

2496
02:38:08,711 --> 02:38:09,311
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, that's it.

2497
02:38:09,451 --> 02:38:10,211
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm curious.

2498
02:38:11,351 --> 02:38:13,872
[SPEAKER_18]: Questions for the two of us, please.

2499
02:38:16,511 --> 02:38:17,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry, what?

2500
02:38:17,611 --> 02:38:17,951
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

2501
02:38:18,252 --> 02:38:18,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Next question.

2502
02:38:18,892 --> 02:38:22,213
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm curious about what they would like to ask us.

2503
02:38:22,253 --> 02:38:23,233
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, here we go.

2504
02:38:23,293 --> 02:38:23,833
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm moving on.

2505
02:38:23,873 --> 02:38:24,794
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm moving on with more questions.

2506
02:38:25,034 --> 02:38:25,234
[SPEAKER_18]: Cool.

2507
02:38:25,534 --> 02:38:29,095
[SPEAKER_03]: EOSFVB, do you carry a pen with you everywhere?

2508
02:38:29,875 --> 02:38:30,935
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't.

2509
02:38:31,736 --> 02:38:31,996
[SPEAKER_19]: I do.

2510
02:38:32,796 --> 02:38:33,316
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need to.

2511
02:38:33,356 --> 02:38:34,596
[SPEAKER_03]: I always borrow my pen from Jamie.

2512
02:38:35,657 --> 02:38:37,077
[SPEAKER_06]: My pen is also a glow stick.

2513
02:38:37,677 --> 02:38:38,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, dear.

2514
02:38:39,918 --> 02:38:41,238
[SPEAKER_06]: I carry the penis mightier.

2515
02:38:42,839 --> 02:38:44,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the penis mightier.

2516
02:38:47,048 --> 02:38:48,409
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you carry a pot lid too?

2517
02:38:52,031 --> 02:38:59,816
[SPEAKER_08]: I carry a fan I like to be the first on the show to say that I outright boycott any more Battle Royale references in the show

2518
02:39:02,063 --> 02:39:05,384
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have any questions about Battle Royale, ask the dictionaries.

2519
02:39:05,404 --> 02:39:05,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie and I.

2520
02:39:23,451 --> 02:39:26,193
[SPEAKER_03]: VidPowa, second question from VidPowa.

2521
02:39:26,313 --> 02:39:27,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so confused.

2522
02:39:28,115 --> 02:39:31,738
[SPEAKER_03]: What exactly is this Bomani Battle Royale that you keep talking about?

2523
02:39:32,919 --> 02:39:34,160
[SPEAKER_19]: Battle Royale is a movie.

2524
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:39,404
[SPEAKER_19]: Go to BattleRoyaleOnline.com and it's the best movie ever.

2525
02:39:39,864 --> 02:39:45,789
[SPEAKER_06]: And imagine a bunch of us just flipping around the living room throwing paper plates at each other, stabbing each other with candles in the eye.

2526
02:39:47,469 --> 02:39:49,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I can break this down very easily.

2527
02:39:50,490 --> 02:39:53,612
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens when a bunch of six-year-olds watch the Power Rangers?

2528
02:39:53,672 --> 02:39:54,492
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens after that?

2529
02:39:54,752 --> 02:40:03,256
[SPEAKER_03]: They all pretend that they are Power Rangers and they pretend, you know, I'm the red one, I'm the pink one and they beat each other up, you know, pretend and then they pretend that they're transforming and stuff like that.

2530
02:40:04,696 --> 02:40:05,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up, Dave.

2531
02:40:05,677 --> 02:40:07,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, that's what happened.

2532
02:40:07,378 --> 02:40:16,101
[SPEAKER_03]: We watched Battle Royale, and then suddenly a bunch of six-year-olds were running around my living room playing Battle Royale, cutting each other with paper plates, strangling each other with tape.

2533
02:40:16,521 --> 02:40:17,262
[SPEAKER_03]: It was beautiful.

2534
02:40:18,282 --> 02:40:19,663
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the Bomani Battle Royale.

2535
02:40:19,723 --> 02:40:24,245
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's when I got knee-dropped into Rob's coffee table by zero.

2536
02:40:26,218 --> 02:40:31,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing will, uh... Actually, I pushed her and she just kind of fell, but... I didn't knee drop her, she knee dropped herself.

2537
02:40:31,680 --> 02:40:35,902
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the greatest fuck up all day was Loki doing a caution drop on Max, too.

2538
02:40:38,413 --> 02:40:51,444
[SPEAKER_08]: For one, that wasn't a caution drop, and number two, I had actually put the freeze there for that purpose, but the problem is, is pulling the freeze on the back of your hands when you do, like, a drop like that, you can't hold it down because there's not enough weight.

2539
02:40:51,825 --> 02:40:55,708
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't get your, like, torso up high enough so that all your weight's on your hands.

2540
02:40:56,989 --> 02:40:58,010
[SPEAKER_08]: I should have done knee drop!

2541
02:40:59,551 --> 02:41:01,033
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I couldn't get back up because I'm fat.

2542
02:41:02,370 --> 02:41:06,773
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see someone hold two freeze arrows on the diagonals with each of their ass cheeks.

2543
02:41:07,754 --> 02:41:10,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Just have like one on the left and one on the right and be able to hold it.

2544
02:41:12,397 --> 02:41:15,079
[SPEAKER_05]: As Rob looks at me and his eyebrow twitches.

2545
02:41:18,522 --> 02:41:20,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's move on.

2546
02:41:23,785 --> 02:41:29,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, SnubDistinoid says, Does anyone in the studio have a Game Boy Advance SP?

2547
02:41:29,389 --> 02:41:31,571
[SPEAKER_03]: I got one and safe to say it rocks my cocks.

2548
02:41:32,173 --> 02:41:33,534
[SPEAKER_19]: First of all, those things hurt my hand.

2549
02:41:34,094 --> 02:41:38,376
[SPEAKER_19]: And I have an afterburner in my GBA, so I own you.

2550
02:41:38,496 --> 02:41:39,776
[SPEAKER_03]: I want an afterburner in my GBA.

2551
02:41:39,816 --> 02:41:41,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need a Game Boy SP if I get an afterburner.

2552
02:41:43,337 --> 02:41:44,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anybody have one?

2553
02:41:44,798 --> 02:41:44,978
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2554
02:41:48,940 --> 02:41:49,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Question.

2555
02:41:49,640 --> 02:41:50,660
[SPEAKER_05]: He has more than one?

2556
02:41:53,802 --> 02:41:56,143
[SPEAKER_03]: I read it wrong, but cock doesn't rhyme with rocks.

2557
02:41:57,583 --> 02:41:58,544
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to say cocks.

2558
02:41:58,604 --> 02:41:59,344
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just natural.

2559
02:42:01,118 --> 02:42:06,381
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, uh, one of our chatroom frequenters, if you ever run into him, his name is BigRedPimp.

2560
02:42:07,942 --> 02:42:12,324
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, he does have an SP, so if you want, like, you know, info on it, just ask him.

2561
02:42:12,664 --> 02:42:13,105
[SPEAKER_05]: No, see?

2562
02:42:13,785 --> 02:42:14,725
[SPEAKER_05]: See, wait, wait, hold on.

2563
02:42:14,745 --> 02:42:16,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just say, court, hold on.

2564
02:42:16,546 --> 02:42:18,868
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a person in here whose fiancé works for GameStop, hello.

2565
02:42:20,330 --> 02:42:20,790
[SPEAKER_05]: No, okay.

2566
02:42:21,091 --> 02:42:22,351
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad, Jamie.

2567
02:42:22,371 --> 02:42:23,272
[SPEAKER_05]: God, let me talk.

2568
02:42:23,292 --> 02:42:23,732
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad, Jamie.

2569
02:42:24,193 --> 02:42:25,974
[SPEAKER_05]: No, um, hold on.

2570
02:42:26,054 --> 02:42:26,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me speak.

2571
02:42:26,534 --> 02:42:26,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Zero.

2572
02:42:26,714 --> 02:42:27,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

2573
02:42:28,415 --> 02:42:33,959
[SPEAKER_05]: And let me just say that Corey probably bought one, and he probably got two others just from getting them.

2574
02:42:34,740 --> 02:42:38,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, the SP is, like, the worst idea ever.

2575
02:42:38,902 --> 02:42:44,026
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's cool that it's compact, but it does hurt your hands, and if you have big hands, that's just gonna hurt you, too.

2576
02:42:44,987 --> 02:42:50,010
[SPEAKER_06]: And it just looks kinda cool, but stupid at the same time.

2577
02:42:50,663 --> 02:42:55,847
[SPEAKER_06]: The shoulder buttons are in the most retarded... I know, they're like in the crease of the screen.

2578
02:42:55,867 --> 02:42:56,567
[SPEAKER_06]: That sucks.

2579
02:42:56,688 --> 02:42:57,928
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going on my video game review.

2580
02:42:58,389 --> 02:42:59,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, check it out.

2581
02:42:59,309 --> 02:43:00,771
[SPEAKER_25]: I know how small the GBA is.

2582
02:43:01,791 --> 02:43:02,492
[SPEAKER_25]: The GBA SP.

2583
02:43:02,532 --> 02:43:05,414
[SPEAKER_25]: But it looks like you can play with one hand.

2584
02:43:05,714 --> 02:43:08,716
[SPEAKER_25]: I've tried playing with one hand on the GBA SP.

2585
02:43:08,796 --> 02:43:09,897
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like squeezing a boob.

2586
02:43:10,017 --> 02:43:11,298
[SPEAKER_03]: You look like you're squeezing a boob.

2587
02:43:15,161 --> 02:43:16,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Or rocking your own cocks.

2588
02:43:16,482 --> 02:43:17,963
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, I'm good at it.

2589
02:43:24,727 --> 02:43:30,933
[SPEAKER_25]: The only game that does not work on SP is Kirby's Tilt and Tumble, because you have to rock the Game Boy.

2590
02:43:30,953 --> 02:43:38,601
[SPEAKER_25]: And of course, it's like up equals down, left equals right if you play the game.

2591
02:43:38,621 --> 02:43:42,425
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, because you know how you put the cartridge in.

2592
02:43:43,686 --> 02:43:43,946
[SPEAKER_24]: Indeed.

2593
02:43:46,088 --> 02:43:47,370
[SPEAKER_19]: Just do yourself a favor.

2594
02:43:48,405 --> 02:43:50,826
[SPEAKER_19]: Get a used GBA and get an afterburner.

2595
02:43:50,846 --> 02:43:58,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, these people that are buying these SPs are the same people that bought the Game Boy, then the Game Boy Pocket, then the Game Boy Color, then the Game Boy Advance, and now the SP.

2596
02:43:59,129 --> 02:44:02,310
[SPEAKER_08]: You stupid bastards, do you realize they just milked five systems out of you?

2597
02:44:02,651 --> 02:44:04,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Ha ha, I laugh at you, ass.

2598
02:44:04,871 --> 02:44:08,773
[SPEAKER_06]: I've only bought the Game Boy, and now I'm going to buy the SP.

2599
02:44:10,214 --> 02:44:13,135
[SPEAKER_06]: SP customers are the ones who bought Virtual Boys and enjoyed them.

2600
02:44:13,215 --> 02:44:16,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I bought a Virtual Boy and enjoyed it, and I don't have an SP.

2601
02:44:17,333 --> 02:44:22,555
[SPEAKER_19]: We got a Virtual Boy when Hollywood was clearing them out, so we had the nice plastic case, but that makes me headache.

2602
02:44:22,936 --> 02:44:31,119
[SPEAKER_19]: But no, actually, to be perfectly honest, when the Game Boy Pocket came out, it was a massive improvement over the regular Game Boy because it was clearer.

2603
02:44:31,820 --> 02:44:35,661
[SPEAKER_19]: But I love my Game Boy Color, and I still use it for one thing, DDRGB2.

2604
02:44:38,675 --> 02:44:44,277
[SPEAKER_06]: No, the ones you bought SPs are probably the same ones you bought gamecoms.

2605
02:44:44,437 --> 02:44:44,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

2606
02:44:45,137 --> 02:44:49,158
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, I got a gamecom for five bucks when Toys R Us was clearing the map.

2607
02:44:49,178 --> 02:44:49,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

2608
02:44:52,419 --> 02:44:54,620
[SPEAKER_19]: I own 42 video game systems, so... Okay.

2609
02:44:54,640 --> 02:44:54,900
[SPEAKER_19]: Justin...

2610
02:45:00,623 --> 02:45:03,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Justin Circuit is asking us a bunch of questions here.

2611
02:45:03,686 --> 02:45:04,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here we go.

2612
02:45:04,607 --> 02:45:06,728
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're just going to get a show of hands, okay?

2613
02:45:09,131 --> 02:45:09,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here we go.

2614
02:45:09,771 --> 02:45:12,373
[SPEAKER_03]: He's asking us a variety of questions here, so let's get a show of hands.

2615
02:45:12,714 --> 02:45:15,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Justin Circuit would like to know, how many people like Jenny Rom?

2616
02:45:19,260 --> 02:45:19,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Four and a half.

2617
02:45:20,260 --> 02:45:21,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, four and a half.

2618
02:45:21,502 --> 02:45:22,863
[SPEAKER_03]: How many people like Judy Crystal?

2619
02:45:24,841 --> 02:45:25,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Zero.

2620
02:45:26,402 --> 02:45:26,502
[SPEAKER_03]: One.

2621
02:45:27,383 --> 02:45:27,903
[SPEAKER_03]: A pinky.

2622
02:45:33,506 --> 02:45:34,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Judy Crystal got a pinky.

2623
02:45:35,308 --> 02:45:36,608
[SPEAKER_03]: How many people like Propel?

2624
02:45:41,531 --> 02:45:43,993
[SPEAKER_03]: One, two, three, four, five, six.

2625
02:45:44,393 --> 02:45:45,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, one, two, three.

2626
02:45:45,614 --> 02:45:46,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually counted two hands.

2627
02:45:47,255 --> 02:45:49,576
[SPEAKER_03]: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

2628
02:45:50,097 --> 02:45:50,657
[SPEAKER_03]: All but two.

2629
02:45:51,017 --> 02:45:52,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2630
02:45:53,086 --> 02:45:55,366
[SPEAKER_03]: How many people like Ramune?

2631
02:45:55,426 --> 02:45:55,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Ramune.

2632
02:45:57,787 --> 02:45:58,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Four.

2633
02:45:58,467 --> 02:45:58,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Five.

2634
02:46:01,208 --> 02:46:02,888
[SPEAKER_18]: I brought back 15 Ramune balls.

2635
02:46:03,468 --> 02:46:05,148
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was ramen.

2636
02:46:05,908 --> 02:46:06,729
[SPEAKER_18]: I said balls.

2637
02:46:06,769 --> 02:46:07,729
[SPEAKER_18]: Help me, Rob.

2638
02:46:09,309 --> 02:46:10,089
[SPEAKER_18]: I wasn't trying to.

2639
02:46:10,129 --> 02:46:10,529
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry.

2640
02:46:11,650 --> 02:46:11,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2641
02:46:12,950 --> 02:46:14,830
[SPEAKER_03]: A special question for Angel.

2642
02:46:17,311 --> 02:46:18,451
[SPEAKER_03]: This comes from Shadow.

2643
02:46:20,612 --> 02:46:21,573
[SPEAKER_18]: Shadow, I hate you!

2644
02:46:21,633 --> 02:46:22,993
[SPEAKER_18]: No, no, no, okay, ask the question.

2645
02:46:23,053 --> 02:46:25,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you mind if Jen and I come visit for a while?

2646
02:46:26,575 --> 02:46:27,956
[SPEAKER_18]: Why'd you have to ask that on air?

2647
02:46:27,976 --> 02:46:30,678
[SPEAKER_18]: Can we just deal with that somewhere else, please?

2648
02:46:33,139 --> 02:46:36,781
[SPEAKER_03]: And what kinds of things will be on the agenda?

2649
02:46:38,142 --> 02:46:39,042
[SPEAKER_18]: No comment!

2650
02:46:39,303 --> 02:46:39,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2651
02:46:41,218 --> 02:46:43,400
[SPEAKER_03]: I am now going to end the fucking music.

2652
02:46:43,480 --> 02:46:45,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I missed, JB, Justin, I missed your last line.

2653
02:46:46,022 --> 02:46:47,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever the last thing is you sent.

2654
02:46:47,544 --> 02:46:48,364
[SPEAKER_03]: You asked another question.

2655
02:46:48,384 --> 02:46:49,105
[SPEAKER_03]: I accidentally exit it out.

2656
02:46:49,125 --> 02:46:49,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to resend it.

2657
02:46:49,806 --> 02:46:50,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2658
02:46:52,468 --> 02:46:55,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Since we're out of questions, does anybody in the room have a question for somebody else?

2659
02:46:55,711 --> 02:46:55,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2660
02:46:56,552 --> 02:46:56,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Dave.

2661
02:46:56,832 --> 02:46:59,354
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question for Rob.

2662
02:46:59,895 --> 02:47:00,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

2663
02:47:00,235 --> 02:47:01,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever AAA'd a heavy song?

2664
02:47:01,756 --> 02:47:03,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Have I ever AAA'd a heavy song?

2665
02:47:03,637 --> 02:47:07,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Just this week, I AAA'd La Copa De Vida, which is my first AAA heavy.

2666
02:47:08,160 --> 02:47:08,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

2667
02:47:08,900 --> 02:47:11,501
[SPEAKER_03]: On Extreme, I should say, because I did a few on 4th Mix back then.

2668
02:47:11,541 --> 02:47:11,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, really?

2669
02:47:12,302 --> 02:47:12,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's cool.

2670
02:47:13,402 --> 02:47:17,064
[SPEAKER_19]: I have, on the 4th Mix, Superstar.

2671
02:47:17,364 --> 02:47:17,645
[SPEAKER_19]: Awesome.

2672
02:47:19,205 --> 02:47:21,447
[SPEAKER_19]: That was like when I played Superstar every game I ever played.

2673
02:47:21,467 --> 02:47:22,907
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember that.

2674
02:47:22,947 --> 02:47:24,288
[SPEAKER_19]: But I have a question.

2675
02:47:24,388 --> 02:47:26,489
[SPEAKER_19]: Charim, which of us do you think would win a Battle Royale?

2676
02:47:27,530 --> 02:47:27,950
[SPEAKER_12]: Dave.

2677
02:47:27,970 --> 02:47:28,931
[SPEAKER_12]: Dave.

2678
02:47:28,971 --> 02:47:29,331
[SPEAKER_12]: Dave.

2679
02:47:30,054 --> 02:47:30,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, wait.

2680
02:47:30,534 --> 02:47:30,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2681
02:47:30,835 --> 02:47:33,036
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have... Okay.

2682
02:47:33,276 --> 02:47:36,758
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually got a bunch of questions just now, so I'm going to go through those.

2683
02:47:37,139 --> 02:47:37,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Anita?

2684
02:47:40,261 --> 02:47:41,702
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah.

2685
02:47:41,742 --> 02:47:42,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, hold on.

2686
02:47:42,882 --> 02:47:44,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's let Anita ask her question while I check email.

2687
02:47:45,124 --> 02:47:46,104
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not so much a question.

2688
02:47:46,405 --> 02:47:48,186
[SPEAKER_17]: I have an accomplishment I want to announce.

2689
02:47:48,866 --> 02:47:52,729
[SPEAKER_17]: I passed my first 2DX song with a full combo.

2690
02:47:52,849 --> 02:47:54,029
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay!

2691
02:47:54,630 --> 02:47:56,851
[SPEAKER_17]: It was... It was a beauty of silence.

2692
02:47:57,151 --> 02:47:57,532
[SPEAKER_17]: No, wait.

2693
02:47:57,872 --> 02:47:59,093
[SPEAKER_17]: I forget what song it was.

2694
02:47:59,213 --> 02:47:59,373
[SPEAKER_17]: It was...

2695
02:48:00,758 --> 02:48:04,981
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it was Beauty of Silence or... I think it was... I can't remember.

2696
02:48:06,483 --> 02:48:07,884
[SPEAKER_17]: But it was a full combo.

2697
02:48:07,904 --> 02:48:08,885
[SPEAKER_17]: Yay, I have one too.

2698
02:48:09,726 --> 02:48:12,468
[SPEAKER_18]: I passed three other 2DX songs today.

2699
02:48:12,908 --> 02:48:14,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay, gotta start somewhere.

2700
02:48:14,730 --> 02:48:15,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Full combo too.

2701
02:48:16,872 --> 02:48:20,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Chat room says, Dave, because he's insane, just look at him for the Battle Royale.

2702
02:48:21,016 --> 02:48:21,836
[SPEAKER_19]: I think I'd kick his ass.

2703
02:48:25,071 --> 02:48:30,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Shadow would like to clarify, Shadow would like to clarify, I haven't a clue, but you're not around.

2704
02:48:32,904 --> 02:48:38,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Snub would like to say, on sakbamani.com, who is deleted member and what happened?

2705
02:48:39,165 --> 02:48:40,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh god, you had to bring this up.

2706
02:48:40,366 --> 02:48:44,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, our hosts suck a big ball of shit.

2707
02:48:44,507 --> 02:48:51,248
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened is that some of our files started getting either deleted or zeroed out, which means all the content in them was deleted.

2708
02:48:51,588 --> 02:48:56,109
[SPEAKER_03]: So threads are gone, members are gone, there's no rational explanation for it.

2709
02:48:56,169 --> 02:48:59,590
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, there are servers deciding to fuck with our files.

2710
02:48:59,930 --> 02:49:00,150
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2711
02:49:01,031 --> 02:49:04,555
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I thought it was a quota thing, but it's not because it's still letting me upload new files.

2712
02:49:04,896 --> 02:49:11,764
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the wild monkey they have controlling the server there.

2713
02:49:13,085 --> 02:49:15,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't ever use $1hosting.com.

2714
02:49:15,128 --> 02:49:16,589
[SPEAKER_03]: They suck big balls.

2715
02:49:16,609 --> 02:49:17,710
[SPEAKER_08]: But the press said yes!

2716
02:49:20,053 --> 02:49:20,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

2717
02:49:21,724 --> 02:49:23,065
[SPEAKER_03]: We're working on a backup plan.

2718
02:49:23,085 --> 02:49:24,245
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Jason's not here, unfortunately.

2719
02:49:24,606 --> 02:49:28,008
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime... We're working on a backup plan as we speak.

2720
02:49:28,248 --> 02:49:29,348
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to make forums.

2721
02:49:29,689 --> 02:49:30,969
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how, but I will.

2722
02:49:31,169 --> 02:49:31,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2723
02:49:32,190 --> 02:49:33,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Another show of hands for Justin, please.

2724
02:49:34,071 --> 02:49:34,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Another show of hands.

2725
02:49:34,911 --> 02:49:35,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

2726
02:49:35,892 --> 02:49:37,733
[SPEAKER_03]: How many people like Cup of Child?

2727
02:49:38,173 --> 02:49:39,374
[SPEAKER_03]: Cup of Child, anybody?

2728
02:49:39,794 --> 02:49:40,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Three?

2729
02:49:40,595 --> 02:49:40,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Four.

2730
02:49:41,035 --> 02:49:41,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, four.

2731
02:49:41,615 --> 02:49:41,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2732
02:49:43,616 --> 02:49:44,437
[SPEAKER_08]: And for the... Okay.

2733
02:49:47,859 --> 02:49:48,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2734
02:49:50,982 --> 02:49:51,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Last question, gang.

2735
02:49:51,942 --> 02:49:52,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Last question.

2736
02:49:52,702 --> 02:49:53,343
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a good one.

2737
02:49:53,363 --> 02:49:54,663
[SPEAKER_03]: We can go around the room and ask everyone this.

2738
02:49:54,683 --> 02:49:55,763
[SPEAKER_03]: This one comes from VidPower.

2739
02:49:56,963 --> 02:50:03,485
[SPEAKER_03]: And VidPower would like to know from everybody, and everybody's experienced enough with this game now, what is your favorite 2DX video?

2740
02:50:04,725 --> 02:50:05,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go around.

2741
02:50:05,345 --> 02:50:05,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go around.

2742
02:50:06,066 --> 02:50:07,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting with Jamie, or do you want to go last?

2743
02:50:07,486 --> 02:50:07,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie.

2744
02:50:08,546 --> 02:50:09,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie's last.

2745
02:50:09,066 --> 02:50:09,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Magus.

2746
02:50:11,247 --> 02:50:11,687
[SPEAKER_05]: What else?

2747
02:50:12,107 --> 02:50:12,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Stoic.

2748
02:50:18,889 --> 02:50:19,949
[SPEAKER_25]: I was going to say the same thing.

2749
02:50:19,989 --> 02:50:20,329
[SPEAKER_25]: Stoic.

2750
02:50:23,366 --> 02:50:36,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, um, WowWow70 is because where else does, like, Broccoli have an afro along with Skyscrapers and all this other cool stuff that sends out afro raids and AAAs the world with afros.

2751
02:50:36,909 --> 02:50:37,529
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just cool.

2752
02:50:38,389 --> 02:50:39,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Go afro.

2753
02:50:44,630 --> 02:50:49,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I'll have to say, I like Bad Routine, that's pretty good.

2754
02:50:50,939 --> 02:50:54,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, better team than the guy dancing, or dancers pretty good.

2755
02:50:55,202 --> 02:50:59,725
[SPEAKER_08]: But, if you want to go with eye candy, you can't beat Last Message, because there's giant breasts.

2756
02:50:59,745 --> 02:51:00,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

2757
02:51:01,587 --> 02:51:03,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob licked boobs today.

2758
02:51:03,028 --> 02:51:11,554
[SPEAKER_06]: No, um, okay, I would probably say my favorite one is, and people will laugh at me about this, but, um, the Calcutta video.

2759
02:51:12,174 --> 02:51:19,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Dr. Bombay is my hero, and he owns you, and second best is SOS, but if you get SOS, you have to get the full video on Kazaa.

2760
02:51:23,190 --> 02:51:30,452
[SPEAKER_16]: This is probably really generic and everybody's favorite, but I'd have to say Alien World because it's got the cool little alien puppet doll thing.

2761
02:51:30,952 --> 02:51:33,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Alien World gave me nightmares the first time I saw it.

2762
02:51:33,692 --> 02:51:36,373
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a dream of weird alien people coming to kill me.

2763
02:51:36,873 --> 02:51:37,193
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm done.

2764
02:51:37,593 --> 02:51:41,854
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, Angel made a decision, finally.

2765
02:51:41,994 --> 02:51:44,935
[SPEAKER_18]: I chose V because, well, yeah, it turns into that one too.

2766
02:51:45,255 --> 02:51:46,775
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't believe I didn't think about this.

2767
02:51:47,315 --> 02:51:51,056
[SPEAKER_08]: The best one has to be, one of the best ones has to be Gradius Cyber.

2768
02:51:54,745 --> 02:52:00,449
[SPEAKER_25]: I have a couple.

2769
02:52:01,089 --> 02:52:04,211
[SPEAKER_19]: One of them is definitely Sweet Lab, because it's so cute.

2770
02:52:04,872 --> 02:52:11,396
[SPEAKER_19]: But my overall favorite one, actually I really like Burning Heat, because it's also Gradius 2, which is one of my favorite shooter games ever.

2771
02:52:12,197 --> 02:52:12,937
[SPEAKER_19]: I say Cheer Train.

2772
02:52:13,778 --> 02:52:17,481
[SPEAKER_19]: I love the little thingies walking around with the little sign that says, WIN!

2773
02:52:18,161 --> 02:52:18,581
[SPEAKER_19]: The peeps!

2774
02:52:18,701 --> 02:52:19,342
[SPEAKER_19]: Why am I outnumbered?

2775
02:52:21,784 --> 02:52:22,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Jelly Kiss.

2776
02:52:23,485 --> 02:52:23,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

2777
02:52:24,706 --> 02:52:27,588
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite... I have a serious favorite and a fun favorite.

2778
02:52:27,688 --> 02:52:29,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have a couple serious favorites.

2779
02:52:29,489 --> 02:52:32,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, my favorite video is Reincarnation.

2780
02:52:32,651 --> 02:52:32,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2781
02:52:33,351 --> 02:52:34,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Good, good, good.

2782
02:52:35,534 --> 02:52:36,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Dancer.

2783
02:52:36,354 --> 02:52:36,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, good, good.

2784
02:52:37,154 --> 02:52:45,196
[SPEAKER_03]: And then my favorite 2DX video of all time, and a lot of people forget about this one, but it honestly is the most kick-ass 2DX video they ever did, because they cut it after a couple styles were just sad.

2785
02:52:45,556 --> 02:52:46,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometime.

2786
02:52:46,956 --> 02:52:47,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Never saw it.

2787
02:52:47,436 --> 02:52:48,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometime is the best 2DX video.

2788
02:52:48,536 --> 02:52:49,557
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Root80s.

2789
02:52:49,957 --> 02:52:51,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Root80s is like the best one ever.

2790
02:52:53,777 --> 02:52:54,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

2791
02:52:54,098 --> 02:52:55,758
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the best one is Nothing Ain't Stoppin' Us.

2792
02:52:56,138 --> 02:52:57,098
[SPEAKER_19]: Funky Bingo Paradise.

2793
02:52:57,238 --> 02:52:59,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you can't beat the Boogie Dancers.

2794
02:53:00,299 --> 02:53:01,759
[SPEAKER_18]: The freakin' Funky Bingo Paradise.

2795
02:53:02,779 --> 02:53:05,900
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait, wait, wait, I gotta add another one just because it's all about us.

2796
02:53:06,480 --> 02:53:08,660
[SPEAKER_18]: It's all about Love is Orange.

2797
02:53:09,080 --> 02:53:09,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Love is Orange.

2798
02:53:09,700 --> 02:53:10,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, come on.

2799
02:53:10,861 --> 02:53:13,601
[SPEAKER_18]: I know, it's a good one, it's a good one.

2800
02:53:13,661 --> 02:53:13,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2801
02:53:13,981 --> 02:53:18,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so now you've gotten like every decent 2DX video has just been named.

2802
02:53:20,082 --> 02:53:23,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we need to... Hey, guess what, kids?

2803
02:53:23,583 --> 02:53:24,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what, kids?

2804
02:53:24,223 --> 02:53:24,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, it's that time.

2805
02:53:24,883 --> 02:53:25,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what, kids?

2806
02:53:26,043 --> 02:53:26,824
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a broken record.

2807
02:53:27,064 --> 02:53:27,804
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a broken record.

2808
02:53:27,984 --> 02:53:28,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2809
02:53:29,904 --> 02:53:31,605
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time for the final thoughts.

2810
02:53:31,805 --> 02:53:35,026
[SPEAKER_03]: The show is over, and I've got to get the fuck out of here, right?

2811
02:53:35,126 --> 02:53:38,207
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 9.30, so let's go around and get final thoughts.

2812
02:53:39,548 --> 02:53:40,728
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to go around the room again?

2813
02:53:40,808 --> 02:53:41,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Start with Magus?

2814
02:53:42,649 --> 02:53:43,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, start with Magus.

2815
02:53:44,089 --> 02:53:44,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Final thought, please.

2816
02:53:47,930 --> 02:53:48,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel?

2817
02:53:48,291 --> 02:53:49,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Dave?

2818
02:53:49,711 --> 02:53:50,391
Xenon sucks.

2819
02:53:50,431 --> 02:53:50,992
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not a tool.

2820
02:53:59,208 --> 02:54:06,502
[SPEAKER_05]: and I will hopefully be able to go to V3 and do awesome in Power Station.

2821
02:54:08,357 --> 02:54:11,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, since I didn't get to do a sim update, thanks.

2822
02:54:11,598 --> 02:54:12,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.

2823
02:54:12,598 --> 02:54:13,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hurry up, make it quick.

2824
02:54:13,638 --> 02:54:13,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2825
02:54:14,358 --> 02:54:17,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, new CBS update for Step Maniacs that came out on the 27th.

2826
02:54:17,559 --> 02:54:18,299
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty good.

2827
02:54:18,899 --> 02:54:20,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, then there's also my site.

2828
02:54:20,460 --> 02:54:27,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Since my site right now is up and has all the DDRX stream and everything, pretty much every single official sim file out there, I have.

2829
02:54:27,721 --> 02:54:31,462
[SPEAKER_08]: And DDRUK is down right now, and same with MamaniCell is down.

2830
02:54:31,522 --> 02:54:33,662
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, my server's the only place you can get them.

2831
02:54:33,882 --> 02:54:35,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Too bad I haven't updated my pages to tell you how to get it.

2832
02:54:36,543 --> 02:54:37,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, so there's that.

2833
02:54:37,765 --> 02:54:41,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Check out Bomani Sims because there's tons of Sims on there that people make.

2834
02:54:41,330 --> 02:54:42,011
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of them suck.

2835
02:54:42,652 --> 02:54:44,034
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of them suck.

2836
02:54:44,234 --> 02:54:45,997
[SPEAKER_08]: And then let's see what else.

2837
02:54:46,758 --> 02:54:47,699
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's it.

2838
02:54:47,879 --> 02:54:49,422
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, I'm done.

2839
02:54:49,582 --> 02:54:50,804
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to finish my set tonight.

2840
02:54:52,729 --> 02:54:56,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, basically, mine is, yeah, stop making Max remixes.

2841
02:54:56,590 --> 02:54:58,310
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sick and tired of fucking hearing them.

2842
02:54:58,550 --> 02:54:59,250
[SPEAKER_06]: And they are all shitty.

2843
02:54:59,270 --> 02:54:59,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Except for Loki's.

2844
02:55:00,050 --> 02:55:02,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Except for Loki's and, um, Resurrection.

2845
02:55:03,371 --> 02:55:06,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and, um, let's see what else.

2846
02:55:06,611 --> 02:55:10,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, also, I may suck at freestyling, but how far did the judges get in PA?

2847
02:55:11,972 --> 02:55:13,873
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, yeah, basically that's it.

2848
02:55:13,953 --> 02:55:20,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, next week, I will have a video game review prepared with the help of Dark Child, who will also be helping me out with that.

2849
02:55:20,754 --> 02:55:21,034
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm done.

2850
02:55:24,697 --> 02:55:27,238
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the girl that has no voice.

2851
02:55:31,061 --> 02:55:31,982
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I barely have a voice.

2852
02:55:33,222 --> 02:55:35,964
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know what to say except Ramun is the best drink in the world.

2853
02:55:36,004 --> 02:55:36,545
[SPEAKER_17]: That's about it.

2854
