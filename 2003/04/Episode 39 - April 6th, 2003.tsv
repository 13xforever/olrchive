1830	2690	Message for you, sir.
3130	4030	Attention!
5011	8872	Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
10512	15554	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.
19188	22109	Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
22429	25610	Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
26190	28891	Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
29431	32332	Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
33132	33533	Just kidding.
33733	35333	Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.
35533	42996	In this episode... Hey, are there any balls down there?
43256	45716	That's the biggest berry you've ever seen, Jingleberry.
45816	47437	What's your favorite scary?
48971	49572	Showgirls.
50452	51333	Absolute fright.
51873	52654	What's yours?
52694	55155	There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.
55215	56536	Don't torture yourself.
57137	57937	That's my job.
58077	59839	Now's the time our sprockets bend me dogs!
60779	64542	I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too.
64942	65863	I know Kung Fu.
66223	68585	I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
68885	70706	Why did they have to take the word gay?
72327	74769	No one expects us to punish a physician.
75229	76090	It's him, though.
76150	76370	Hey!
78925	80726	DarkSakura, Shut up!
80926	81586	Where's my gun?
81726	83667	This is my boomstick!
84147	86648	Sky, Come on girls, it's time to drop a bomb!
86968	90690	Loki, I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.
90770	93531	What kind of warped human being would find that funny?
93571	97853	We are live and this is episode number 39 for April the 6th of 2003.
104272	111039	You're tuned into the Bomani Scene's most corrupted radio station of all things bee money.
111960	112900	My name is Rob Roberts.
113061	114102	You might know me as Sky.
114582	118766	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest buddy on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.
118806	120328	You know her better as DarkSakura.
122089	123190	I hate the buzz, you guys.
123250	123991	I really hate it.
124211	125573	There's nothing we can do right now.
125813	126113	Sorry.
127034	128736	In this corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.
131630	134192	I'm against the wall, so technically it's not the corner.
134452	135173	I'm in mid-wall.
135713	136614	Exactly in the center.
138756	141138	Also with us tonight, we have a lot of fucking people in the house.
141198	143680	Say hello to... 23rMegas.
145001	145742	Yo, what's up?
146142	147323	Say hello to DDR Angel.
148004	151086	Still no comment!
151166	152067	Say hello to Blackwab.
154255	155135	Say hello to Dave.
155635	156376	I'm Bobby Cool.
157996	159857	Say hello to Intern Zero.
160977	162177	Unemployed people rock.
162497	163978	And say hello to Dark Tetsuya.
164158	165858	So I rock, huh?
166398	167039	Yeah.
167639	170140	Oh, I like Marin's answer here.
170540	171340	We're outside.
172495	174636	So just imagine that buzzing you hear is the wind.
175597	176537	What?
177037	177878	Ow, I hurt.
178058	179859	No more Battle Royale in my living room.
181020	181560	I won.
182040	183661	Yeah, so we have a lot of people here tonight.
184321	186062	And so we have a lot to talk about.
190985	192326	Fear the paper plates!
192786	193366	Dear good lord.
196127	202112	We'll be talking to everybody a bit later, but first we're going to take a quick break featuring songs everybody hates.
202493	202993	Yay!
204414	206456	We're going to start it off with an old classic.
207117	208098	Garden of Love.
208718	209098	Rock.
209579	212982	We'll be right back in a little bit to have a big clusterfuck.
213082	213442	Enjoy.
218667	219568	Uh, yeah.
221329	222050	Uh, what?
237948	240190	The vision's so deep that the eye can't see.
240230	243371	If you don't know now, then let it be.
243431	244932	Get in the groove.
245093	248775	You can come and go with me.
248815	251096	Just flow with me.
251116	253057	You can speak low to me.
254238	255599	In the garden of love.
268064	270706	The only real thing that speaks so true
308351	309013	Thank you for watching!
404040	404444	Okay.
405192	405959	Challenging move.
519602	521363	Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
521583	524043	Because Bongo demands it.
542428	543429	Everyone die!
543449	544569	The sound card sucks.
545130	546050	Oh, my bad.
546150	553575	So, you'll just have to deal with it until we move into the new studio for season number three, and then we won't have the buzz anymore.
553595	555336	Or we'll just have to do every show from Jamie's from now on.
556096	557157	Buy me a new sound card.
559858	562740	So, wow, what a week, huh?
564614	566175	Yeah, it's been a while since we've been on the air.
566195	569677	Well, not really, because if you guys were listening last week, you heard us live at Shaft.
570018	572919	About this time was March Madness.
573100	574620	Two years ago, you would have heard us live at Shaft.
574681	575121	Oh, shit.
577353	580977	With the entire audience in here, who's actually listening to this outside?
581738	583320	That is an excellent question.
583900	587845	The numbers in the studio are all-time high, the numbers on the web, all-time low.
587925	589647	No, hello to all of you listening, we appreciate it.
591228	592650	Yeah, live from Shaft, my bad.
592670	595693	And I'm at an all-time high by myself.
595793	596334	I know, I know.
596634	598136	And it's not about mics either.
600357	602497	Live from March Madness last week, if you were listening.
604978	610700	About this time was when DDR... Oh, the buzz went away for like half a second.
610720	611120	It was amazing.
611840	615681	This was about the time that DDR Idol was finishing up.
615721	623884	This was probably about the time that, oh, I don't know, maybe 23rd Magus was taking the stage right after Dr. Dick finished his routines.
625796	627017	What are you shaking the microphones for?
627057	631621	First off, you have two more mics, so why don't you try swapping one?
631641	632761	It won't help, trust me.
632882	634763	Trust me, I've done everything to do this buzz.
634803	636825	It's the noise of the hard drive.
636845	639026	The power of Christ compels you!
639567	641468	The power of Christ compels you!
641989	642849	He just made it worse.
643069	645571	It's the noise of the hard drive in there.
646392	646872	Or something.
647093	647673	It's fucked up.
648434	651376	Anyway... So, yeah, tournament...
652489	653370	What did you guys think?
653390	656411	What did you guys think of those of you that went to March Madness?
656451	656832	How was it?
657332	667558	A B. Nice toss, Rob.
667618	669059	B in my paradise sucks.
669959	671600	I hate it.
671900	672961	But it's Mr. Wendell.
673041	674262	He makes everything good.
675382	676623	Yeah, but not for B.A.
678584	679624	Yeah, not for me.
679644	680265	Ah, you got owned.
680985	681445	Shut up.
681685	682666	I had never played this.
683186	683526	You got owned.
683566	685107	I had never played it before.
685187	686247	But you got owned.
686307	687427	Shut the fuck up, man.
687988	688208	Owned.
688228	689168	Dude.
689248	690389	Let me say something.
690769	691749	Jeez, okay.
692509	693830	Don't want to couple doubles.
694050	694490	Sucked.
696571	701893	Okay, and Xenon also sucked because it does, and it's really hard to PA.
702533	703013	Fuck that.
703974	706975	As for me, I came, I saw, I twitched.
708720	710402	The left arrow in Sakura sucks.
711283	711964	The fuck is that?
712004	712685	Stealing a mic?
712745	715248	It's in my hand and you're just like, wank?
715288	716209	The fuck is that?
717170	720353	You can't let me get a comment in before you have to say some shit.
720433	721575	I didn't see shit.
721875	722816	I didn't do shit.
722836	725019	But sitting in that back room for both days...
726189	727910	Wow, people flaked out on me.
728391	730212	Now you know how it feels.
732614	732894	Sorry.
734595	737137	Jamie was well done by the time that was over.
737197	738378	She was cooking in that room there.
738438	739379	I hated people.
739599	740520	But we loved Jamie.
740580	741801	I wanted everybody to die.
741961	743842	We loved Jamie for, you know, helping out.
743862	744543	I had a good time.
744723	745604	Making everything run.
745764	747325	I mean, you got visited by lots of people.
747705	748026	Yes, I did.
748046	749206	And you got to eat bubbles with me.
749787	750507	I didn't eat bubbles.
750547	750968	I blew them.
758635	758895	Rob?
759396	760076	Yes.
760256	760477	Ow!
762598	763019	Rob died again.
763039	768083	You know, someone had to do the organizational stuff, and we're all grateful that Jamie didn't bother to sit back there.
768143	772567	I mean, I would have done it myself, but I was locked up in that goddamn glass box.
773327	777050	And trust me, it sucks hard being able to see the tournament and not hear a damn thing.
777471	778552	Especially on DDR.
778812	780593	I heard everything and didn't see a damn thing.
782055	783636	By the way, hold out your arm.
785317	785738	You're dead too.
788015	790317	Jamie hit me with the tail of a furry thing.
792340	798506	You know, I would have loved to have helped Jamie out in the back room, but I was too busy smoking and drinking behind everyone's backs.
798626	799747	You'll have to forgive Jamie.
799787	801849	She's been on a Battle Royale kick lately.
803731	805032	We all have.
806594	807975	And we played mocap golf.
808156	808876	That was...
810680	815222	Only because it freaking rode over for like three holes and then you happened to get lucky and win one.
815502	816863	Otherwise, it would have kicked your ass.
817043	817903	Oh, shut up.
818624	820724	Yeah, who won the long drive?
820925	821485	Yeah, that's right.
821525	823146	I think I won the long drive.
823426	824106	So watch this.
824146	824886	Shut the hell up.
825006	827247	Drive for show, putt for dough, bitch.
828228	828688	Whatever.
830165	833446	Dude, I hit a 50-foot chip to make an eagle.
833986	834446	So?
834846	835886	Ooh, wow.
836067	836567	It was cool.
836727	838907	I've made chips for eagles and birdies before.
838947	839307	It's easy.
839707	840028	Yeah.
840228	840808	Well, you know what?
840848	842668	That was my first one, so you can shut your mouth.
843128	845989	Hey, have you actually ever gotten par on that one that goes uphill?
848350	850310	The one that goes, like, really, really steep uphill?
851090	852531	Yes, I have gotten par on that twice.
853031	855952	Goddamn, I got, like, a quadruple bogey on that shit.
856412	857052	I have propel.
857822	860924	This is the reason why golf is on TV and no one watches it.
862185	864507	Okay, welcome to Orange Lounge, MoCap Golf Radio.
864587	866548	Someone must watch it, they have the golf channel.
867049	868530	I want MoCap Battle Royale.
869090	870651	I want MoCap Battle Royale.
870671	871512	MoCap napping.
872253	879618	I want somebody, anyone who has programming skill, get like, you know, Quake or one of those things, what was it you were saying, Counter-Strike?
881005	883087	and make the Battle Royale Counter-Strike.
883828	890656	Wait, let me just say that real quick, some guy hit a 357-yard drive and got like a 63 to win some championship or something, course record.
891176	892718	Good, but God still hates him.
893318	894660	357 yards in one haul.
894820	895621	Yeah, in real life.
895921	897023	God hates golfers.
898641	901065	Hey, why does Dave look like he's Obi-Wan over here?
901626	904009	Golf is paid for by morons who buy ugly pants.
904150	904851	Use the force.
905251	906113	But anyways, no.
906133	908957	That's why plaid will never go out of fashion because of golfers.
909137	910439	And scotchmen.
910619	911200	I know you said...
914842	921549	I know you said that Counter-Strike sucks for doing it, but for Battle Royale, Counter-Strike is like the best thing to edit.
921589	922730	I hit a vital organ.
922750	925233	That's the easiest thing to do.
925333	933621	And by the way, yes, thank you for asking, yes, I did compete last week in freestyle, and I got all fails!
934462	936504	How did that go, your very first freestyle?
937366	957218	I had a nervous breakdown about five minutes before it was my turn because I fell playing a challenge in front of everybody and then I freaked out and then I got up and finally played and I think I did alright for my first but it's old school and no one likes old school anymore so fuck them.
957238	958939	Don't start that again.
959279	965863	Yes, and for those of you in the chatroom and listening who got to hear my lovely little rant remember it because you'll never hear it again.
966638	969259	I want to know who those chicks were that were massaging my hair.
969659	974080	I have no idea who those people were and they're just like coming up to me, rubbing up against me for DVDs.
974240	976461	Like, I got the DVDs, yeah.
976521	977801	Okay, hold on, I've realized something.
978782	982763	Don't steal a girl's glasses because then she follows you around and annoys all your friends.
983263	987384	She just had these cool glasses and I stole them and then she decided that she would try to like fuck everybody or something.
987424	988725	I don't know what it was she was doing.
989105	991085	So that's what I was doing wrong when I was single.
991426	992506	Didn't steal glasses.
993306	994147	Mental notes.
994227	995407	Steel glasses.
996028	997689	Yeah, you gotta steal the nerve glasses.
998629	1000230	So that's how I get the pre-teen booty.
1001271	1002812	They were hoes anyway, you could tell.
1004653	1005594	Yeah, yeah.
1006294	1007835	Uh-oh, looks like you hit a nerve.
1011777	1019502	Like I was telling two friends after the first day of the tourney, what walks on two legs and spells slut?
1019762	1020062	What?
1020863	1021723	I'm not saying it on the air.
1021763	1021923	No.
1028188	1033150	This is quiet, so... Oh, what I need is a good defense.
1033170	1036211	So anyways, yeah, it was Let the Beat Hit Em that I freestyled to.
1038012	1038752	Watch the video.
1039213	1043774	It's another white guy freestyling, or some white guy doing Let the Beat Hit Em.
1043794	1044735	That's what the title is.
1044895	1046796	Yeah, that's what you got titled as, Some White Guy.
1046896	1047576	Some White Guy.
1047916	1048917	I am Some White Guy.
1049237	1049877	That's great.
1051872	1052412	Xerox.
1052452	1054233	Well, he didn't even get my song.
1054613	1055894	Okay, fuck that shit.
1055994	1062956	Alright, it's fucking clearly zero space X. I don't know where the fuck somebody gets Xerox.
1063216	1067518	Okay, it doesn't even start with an X. I mean, fucking go to school.
1068925	1069265	Fuck you.
1069585	1070186	Go bite.
1070686	1071367	Fucking morons.
1071647	1072787	At least you got your name.
1073168	1077430	Except that you have to realize that when everybody sees that, everybody says Xerox.
1077450	1078291	Blah, blah, blah, fuck you.
1079972	1081333	When everybody is saying Xerox.
1081353	1081733	Doesn't matter.
1082353	1083574	Xerox.
1086236	1088117	Hooked on phonics works for me.
1088197	1088858	Not for them.
1089278	1090499	I've got yellow fever.
1092700	1094261	There's a snake in my boot.
1094401	1097263	They were reading it as one word because they thought it was Asian typing.
1099847	1103969	Well, hey, my first tournament in March Madness last year, I was Electoddle or something?
1107290	1107830	No, okay.
1108710	1111611	I looked at that paper, and it was clearly written, Zero Eggs.
1111692	1114092	I mean, if you were that big of a moron, I'm sorry.
1114633	1118774	Well, you just thought you were Leet to Xerox, with a Z. You know what?
1118954	1119935	I don't give a fuck!
1120335	1121195	You could go to school!
1121475	1122636	Go buy a Xerox machine!
1123776	1124576	I'm still Ski.
1127145	1130187	Okay, I guess that makes it a little better, but I'm still not fucking Xeroxed.
1130387	1133568	At least you're not some white guy doing some song.
1134029	1139091	I am some white guy, and I swear to God if another face goes in my hand, if another hand goes in my face, I'm gonna punch somebody.
1139612	1140412	I'M BLIND!
1142133	1143314	What up, my honkies?
1145695	1146735	I am some white guy.
1146875	1150117	You are some white guy, but I am the OTHER white guy.
1150517	1151438	Okay, freestyler.
1152418	1153579	Whatever, intern.
1153639	1154680	Ooh, intern, that's a threat.
1154720	1155100	Intern!
1156969	1158730	Well, at least he's part of staff.
1160371	1160852	I die.
1162293	1165395	Oh, with the pee.
1166716	1167957	Moving right along.
1168877	1172079	Let's talk about why everyone's here right now.
1172620	1173681	They're not here to see me.
1175802	1179204	I think actually the celebrity of the weekend would be DDR Angel, who's back.
1179685	1180505	Okay, and then Jamie.
1181526	1184188	So Angel, you've been where for the past five weeks?
1186526	1189228	I missed all of you guys for five weeks, but that's okay.
1189528	1190549	What part of Japan did you go to?
1191209	1198633	I went to Kyushu Island, which is basically the southernmost, almost the southernmost part of Japan.
1199694	1202175	Kyushu Island, Kagoshima City, it was cool.
1202636	1204157	So what kind of stuff did you get to see while you were there?
1204897	1205577	You want to hear a story?
1205778	1206438	Yeah, let's hear a story.
1206498	1207018	A funny story?
1207158	1207639	Yay!
1208459	1210300	Well, I thought it was funny, but okay.
1210340	1212962	That was the first time the buzz stopped.
1213202	1214463	I know, just ignore the buzz.
1214483	1214683	Shut up!
1215717	1221480	Alright, alright, so I went shopping one day with my relatives and my mother and whatever.
1222121	1223702	Okay, so I walk into the store.
1224722	1226303	What do I hear right outside the door?
1227364	1228044	DDR music.
1229345	1234448	I run to the store frantically looking for a DDR machine going, I gotta play, I gotta play, I gotta play.
1235128	1236709	I mean, I sounded like Loki, okay?
1237789	1238270	Where's the machine?
1238350	1238810	Where's the machine?
1238890	1239370	Where's the machine?
1241812	1242612	Did I find it?
1243052	1243833	Did I find it?
1244645	1246786	No, no, no, I didn't find it.
1247806	1251648	I ended up noticing that it was coming from the freaking loudspeaker!
1253348	1261771	So, I walk up to this lady that was working there, and I kindly ask her, was it her CD?
1262012	1264693	Just, you know, by the off chance that it might have been.
1265353	1267053	And she said no, that it was the store's.
1267073	1267113	So,
1275623	1276064	No, no, no.
1276804	1279066	See, because then I said, can I buy it?
1279967	1288455	And then she looked at me like a weird look, or with a weird look, and then she was probably saying in her head, you stupid American.
1288475	1290717	Yeah, I got to go to one.
1296553	1299956	I got to play some Japanese people, and they thought I was cool, and they thought I was really good.
1300837	1301778	And I kicked his ass.
1302158	1302779	That's awesome.
1302799	1304160	But did you actually play DDR?
1304380	1304620	Yes, I did.
1304660	1306422	And there were actually other people playing DDR?
1306562	1306782	Yes.
1307003	1307823	I knew it was rumors.
1307923	1309165	Yes, I played Poppin' Music 9.
1309765	1310606	How was Poppin' Music?
1310926	1317813	Poppin' Music was okay, but unfortunately... Sorry, Joe, but... Can I do that?
1317933	1318093	Yeah.
1319982	1329705	Anyways, we were playing Poppin' Music here last night because our new Vimani friend Garrett brought it over and it has Boa Boa Lady Another on it.
1330265	1335066	That in itself made my day.
1335086	1336786	We're still going on the Japan trip.
1336826	1337686	We'll catch up to present.
1337706	1338767	Where was it?
1338827	1339187	Poppin' Music 9.
1339327	1340887	That's right, Poppin' Music 9.
1341587	1343968	Now what was the rumor that was going around for Poppin' Music 9?
1346147	1346668	Absolute.
1347189	1348530	Yes, Absolute.
1349031	1350513	I played Absolute.
1350833	1351554	And what did I do?
1352235	1352815	What did I do?
1353376	1354137	I passed it.
1354658	1355499	Yay.
1356780	1357501	There is proof.
1357601	1358542	Rob has proof.
1358642	1359944	Tron was in it.
1361025	1361806	Tron was in it.
1361986	1362347	Yeah.
1369980	1373163	Well, Dark Tootsie apparently thought it was a rumor, I don't know.
1373223	1374204	Whatever, whatever.
1374244	1376366	So we know it's really there and all that jazz.
1379349	1384454	Speaking of which, I will be going to Japan in two weeks, for two weeks, so that will be cool.
1384834	1387036	Dave gets a squee!
1387717	1393903	I'm going to Tokyo and Kyoto and Osaka, and I'm not going to buy you porn, what, what?
1394743	1395044	Why?
1395124	1403810	Because my brother is there right now and we're going to see him because over the summer he will be in Tokyo doing something for work or something like that.
1404491	1405792	And so he'll be doing something.
1406653	1408894	And so we're going to see him because it'll be like the last time.
1409555	1415159	And I'm going to be in Tokyo for three days and then I think Osaka for like a week and Kyoto for a few days.
1415179	1415680	I don't know.
1416560	1424785	and I will go to an arcade and I will see if... Yeah, I'll go to the really big one in Tokyo and I'll be like, wow, there's no one playing DDR.
1425565	1435131	Like my brother took a... My brother took a... He went to a fairly large arcade there and they had a whole Bomani corner and he took a picture of it.
1435611	1436451	It was empty.
1437052	1438452	There was no one playing.
1439253	1442695	Hey Dave, do you really want to get drunk in Japan?
1445462	1446303	I don't know.
1446863	1447404	I don't know.
1448405	1450507	Because, uh, I know a really quick way.
1451408	1451968	How?
1452729	1459475	Go to a vending machine that has beer, and, like, nobody's watching you, still have money in it, and you can get beer and get drunk.
1460396	1461657	Japanese beer isn't that good.
1461677	1462838	Yeah, but they have sake, too!
1467757	1469558	Wait, I have a question for Angel.
1469578	1471139	No, I have a serious question for Angel.
1471239	1478743	Were there any other interesting games that you saw there, like new games that a lot of people seem to be playing, like maybe outside of Bomani or any other kinds of games that seem to be kind of popular?
1478843	1479603	Anything that caught your eye?
1480403	1483985	Something about, I think it was like Midnight something, I don't know.
1484826	1486246	What kind of game was it, like a fighting game?
1486547	1489748	It seemed like it was a racing game, so maybe it's another initial day.
1490008	1491229	Yes, Midnight Club.
1492369	1493190	Midnight Club, that was right.
1494489	1498690	Initial D is also ridiculously popular in the Asian sector.
1498730	1501711	There were like five Initial D machines in this arcade I saw in Singapore.
1502031	1504912	And in the freaking airport in Korea, they had an Initial D machine.
1505392	1513515	Which leads me to believe that, you know... And they had a pump-it-up machine in Korea, so... Um... What about Bunga Bunga?
1513555	1514555	Did you see that by chance?
1515355	1516596	Um... A Bunga.
1517036	1517216	No.
1518696	1519396	The spanking game.
1519416	1520697	You wanna know something else that was funny?
1520977	1521157	What?
1523123	1528306	Randomly, there was Rhythm and Police playing in the background of the news.
1529486	1530827	Like the same version from DDR?
1530907	1531127	Yes.
1531747	1532287	Interesting.
1533068	1534348	I was like, oh my god!
1534668	1535609	It's Rhythm and Police!
1535789	1538910	My uncle and my aunt and everybody was looking at me and I'm like, sorry.
1539130	1540491	Okay, now I'm considered crazy.
1540531	1540951	Great.
1541331	1542812	Did you get to eat at Americatown?
1545153	1546594	For anybody that saw The Simpsons.
1547148	1551189	What in the... Alright, whatever.
1551249	1555630	Okay, there's this episode of The Simpsons where they go to Japan, and Homer's, you know, they want to, where do they want to eat?
1555690	1563171	Homer wants to go, Homer wants to go eat in America Town, and Marge is like, we could eat American food back home, but he insists they go to America Town, it's just funny.
1563191	1568092	And then the waiter's like, hi, I am stupid American waiter, can I take your order?
1568412	1569853	Would you like meat food?
1572748	1574049	It was worth a shot, I had to see it.
1574129	1578950	When you go, when you go, you have to, I'll get you the address for the, um, Taito Arcade.
1579411	1584552	You need to go there and take me pictures, because I want to go there to, like, see, like, the Rose and Rosa Pond, you know, bubble bubble machine.
1584572	1588274	There's so many people I know going to Japan in, like, next week or two, it's crazy.
1588294	1589714	I'm going in a couple, couple years.
1590095	1596637	No, seriously, my roommate's going to Japan for a year, Angel just came back to Japan, Dave's now going to Japan, one of my really good friends in Seattle is going to Japan.
1596657	1598878	I've got so much shit coming back for me, it's not even funny.
1599538	1601378	You have to bring me back a magazine.
1601739	1606340	Dave, I have another quick request.
1606600	1611561	If I loaned you a remote kit, would you go and do interviews with people in the arcade?
1612281	1613481	Would you just do random interviews?
1613601	1616722	Dude, Bakagaijin on the street would be the greatest segment ever.
1617542	1619703	Stupid American in Japan, come on, you gotta do it.
1620723	1622764	What would I interview them on?
1623225	1624365	Bramante, you've got to go to the arcade.
1624385	1625926	You're going to go to an arcade while you're there, right?
1625946	1626187	Yeah.
1626367	1629409	Just say, hey, I'm from the American media.
1630770	1637674	And say, there's this really big American show, and I want to talk to you about this game that's taking over America.
1638034	1640536	And they'll probably go, huh?
1640556	1641917	Talk to a random businessman.
1641997	1642637	I could try.
1642737	1643137	I mean...
1646474	1647815	I mean, I don't know.
1649035	1650856	And then go, Orange Lounge Radio, yee!
1653858	1656319	Say you're from Orange Lounge Radio, you'll get laughed out of the country.
1656539	1657060	Okay.
1657780	1658981	Orange Lounge Banzai!
1663863	1665584	Oh my god, State Yasuo on the show.
1666664	1667485	Wait, wait, wait, Rob!
1668288	1669309	Another random sighting.
1669770	1670110	What's that?
1670450	1676096	Synchronized love during a car commercial with like a bunch of para girls in black and yeah, my friend had a cow.
1676456	1679139	Did you see, did you happen to get to see any para clubs?
1679479	1680841	Or did you get to go to any para clubs?
1680861	1682642	Did you go to a store that sold big boots?
1683263	1683523	No.
1684584	1684925	Boring.
1686132	1696516	Yeah, but, uh, I was at this... Remember, Pa... Remember, Pa is a big thing in, like, Tokyo and Osaka, and she wasn't, like, there, so... True.
1696536	1696856	True enough.
1697596	1700117	Okay, so anything else you want to tell us about your trip?
1700257	1701598	Um, not much, except, uh...
1703835	1710780	You have to post that one picture of that unmentionable thing that I was talking about that nobody knows about in America.
1710960	1712240	I'll have to find it.
1712581	1713381	I'll find it for you.
1713401	1713621	Okay.
1713902	1714762	We'll have to find it later.
1715843	1716123	Neat.
1716763	1719245	I have an FU about everything later, by the way.
1720146	1720906	If that's okay with you.
1720946	1721867	We'll do FUs later.
1722207	1722407	What?
1723928	1724468	Super toilet?
1724548	1724809	Maybe.
1725049	1725249	Maybe?
1727449	1728850	Okay, so, moving right along.
1728930	1730691	So, Angel comes back into town.
1730751	1733672	We decided to have a little welcome home party last night, so that's why everybody was here.
1735433	1736614	Almost everybody!
1737014	1741016	Somebody forgot to, I don't know, inform me that this stuff was going on.
1741036	1744057	Everyone's like, everyone's like, hey, you going to the party?
1744137	1744418	What party?
1744438	1746539	There was a freaking huge party here last night.
1746559	1746859	There was like...
1747299	1749481	Literally everybody was there and everybody was still here.
1749681	1752863	It was not my job to send out the invitations.
1752963	1754725	I thought everybody knew through the chatroom.
1754785	1757326	I thought Angel was harassing everybody as they came to the chatroom.
1757346	1758387	Are you going to be a Rob Saturday?
1758407	1759368	Are you going to be a Rob Saturday?
1759428	1760329	I didn't even know.
1760349	1762410	Shit, I even brought my girlfriend, dude.
1762650	1765312	I didn't even know about it until we looked in your live journal.
1765352	1767734	Yeah, I didn't even know about it, so fuck you.
1767934	1771237	I brought it up to her and she's like, what party?
1771497	1771637	What?
1773278	1774819	It wasn't supposed to be a party.
1774879	1778940	It was supposed to be friends come over and we hang out and then we go to Scandia.
1779221	1782142	We're going to have a social gathering and have a good caravan that goes to Scandia.
1782202	1784363	Suddenly, oh my god, there's a party going on in my house.
1784383	1786523	Well, dude, there was poppin' music.
1786583	1788664	I mean, it's poppin'.
1789925	1791706	But they're at Scandia, Nick.
1792386	1793146	I brought Germania.
1793866	1794707	Yeah, you did, didn't you?
1794767	1795307	Yes, I did.
1795347	1797588	They were poppin'.
1798388	1801029	Rob's all like, angels coming, angels coming, angels coming.
1801650	1802490	Do a theater near you.
1805140	1828156	This summer, Angel Angel returns, coming to a theater near you this summer Anyway, yeah, hi So, we had a party and we watched Battle Royale because Angel hadn't seen this movie And if you haven't seen Battle Royale yet, Jamie, break it down Talk about what Battle Royale is all about for those that haven't seen
1829176	1841987	In the future, students boycott schools, so the Japanese government decides to enact the BR project, or the BR Act, which means that they pick a randomly selected 9th grade class, put them all on an island, and they have to kill each other until one's left.
1844122	1857103	There's a lot more symbolic meaning behind that True, but I like watching all the deaths But watching a whole bunch of really pretty Japanese people kill each other is a sheer joy in life Dude, it was all about Mitsuko I don't want to be a loser
1860643	1861604	He was my hero.
1861624	1862885	If he was a good guy, it would have been better.
1862905	1868471	If I was a guy who had the radio that told me where everybody else was, I would have lived a lot longer than he did, you know?
1869992	1871053	Dude, he lived a long time.
1871073	1872775	That was Hiroki who had the GPS.
1873255	1875497	My favorite was Mimura, the hacker.
1876678	1878700	He was so awesome.
1878820	1881343	And I finally caught the pun of the name of his computer.
1882023	1882524	The third man.
1883985	1884606	After his own name.
1887426	1891709	But then of course after we watched Battle Royale What did you think of Battle Royale, Angel, the first time seeing it?
1892229	1916546	It kicked much ass And then we had much fun afterwards Yes, after we watched Battle Royale A Battle Royale broke out in my living room With paper plates and magic markers And scotch tape and red marker Yes, I wrote up name tags for people who died And how they died DDR Angel choked on a pretzel And all the time I was in the other room playing pop music
1917771	1919192	I got hit in the eye with a candle.
1919552	1920673	Choked on a pretzel.
1920693	1921813	Do I even want to know?
1922654	1923895	She was hanging out with George Bush.
1925616	1927497	Okay, now I know I don't want to know.
1929158	1933280	So now we're thinking, gee, how can we incorporate Battle Royale into our everyday lives?
1933500	1936842	And one idea is maybe we could just go to QZAR and take our frustrations out that way.
1937203	1940444	But QZAR's not messy enough, so we decided maybe paintball.
1940905	1941805	But then paintball's hurt.
1941845	1943506	They really do hurt when you get shot with it.
1943526	1944647	Don't wear loose clothes.
1944827	1946068	Loose clothing doesn't hurt.
1946727	1947788	You talked to my friend, didn't you?
1947908	1949649	You're trying to get me to buy the gun as well!
1949869	1950510	Damn you!
1950910	1952051	Damn you!
1952671	1953712	I know you, Andy!
1954052	1955353	You've gotten to them also!
1956273	1959175	What we need to do is we actually need to make the survival packs.
1960276	1961757	And pick a place to go camping.
1962938	1966400	And we need to give one person a fan, give some person a pellet gun.
1967241	1967481	You know...
1974264	1984748	When Battle Royale first came out, Tokyo Pop, the magazine, had this big, huge feature on it, and it had all the weapons that the kids that you didn't see on TV had, and there were some seriously ridiculous ones, like a pot lid.
1984868	1988170	Dude, the pot lid was the best thing in the movie, and it even proved it.
1989830	1992052	Battle Royale Online.com.
1992292	1992732	Go there.
1994214	1998917	The pot lid was the best, and everybody knows it, because it saved his life.
1999378	2002340	Dude, the psycho guy, Kiriyama, he got the freaking Hadesan.
2002720	2005202	He was my hero, and he killed everybody.
2005663	2012308	And one of the girls who was up on the mountain, one of them got the megaphone, the other girl with her got a headband that said, go for it.
2014944	2019468	But seriously, in my opinion, the best character was our, well, I'm not gonna give it away, so never mind.
2019628	2024211	My favorite guy was the other foreign, the other exchange student, yeah.
2024332	2025593	Yeah, how would that give it away?
2025613	2029135	The one who helped him out, you know.
2029296	2030537	What would that point be?
2031397	2032718	One more thing about Japan.
2032758	2033399	Yeah, go.
2033419	2033819	Rough.
2033839	2034300	Anyways!
2043007	2044348	What do you need now?
2044928	2045168	Huh?
2045288	2045748	What do you need?
2046009	2049230	There's one thing that we rule over Japan, okay?
2049490	2049650	What?
2049831	2053792	I saw no, no extreme machines over there.
2053973	2054213	None.
2054873	2055133	None.
2055373	2055813	Really?
2056334	2057734	And we have them all over the place.
2057754	2058435	So what happens?
2058895	2059695	DDR's dead.
2060136	2060816	DDR's dead.
2063397	2064598	But that means I'm dead!
2065285	2065785	You're not dead.
2066085	2067266	Look at the beginning of my name!
2068267	2072989	In Japan, the life cycle for fads there is, like, ridiculously fast.
2073329	2073750	You know what?
2073810	2077712	In a year, no, not even a year, in like three months, you're gonna change your nickname to 2DX Angel.
2078192	2079433	Because, why, what happens?
2079793	2084756	Everybody gets frickin' burned out on DDR, and then they're all of a sudden, they're 2DX.
2085076	2087137	So you'll be 2DX Angel in three months, I guarantee it.
2087857	2090999	Is 2DX still big there, or is it, like, is all the monsters dead?
2091019	2092480	Trust me, she hasn't been getting very good.
2093881	2094321	Haven't you?
2095095	2098958	Actually, I got some, like, schoolgirls to, like, take a picture, so it was cool.
2099459	2102201	They were playing, and they were... Hey, you could pass 5-1-1.
2102261	2102841	Loki!
2104082	2106004	Would you like to make a comment on schoolgirls?
2106524	2108025	Ooh, schoolgirls.
2111688	2112469	Roses are red.
2112809	2114250	Violets are blue.
2114530	2115631	This show's about panties.
2116832	2120034	The back of the colorful DVD that Loki gave us all during March Madness.
2122496	2124258	It's just like, what the fuck?
2125413	2127273	It's also got an alternate cover on the other side.
2127533	2128314	More panty action.
2128334	2129794	You actually see butt crack in that one.
2131074	2133415	I have, I have, I have man, man prong.
2134815	2145097	The one suggestion for Battle Royale that didn't get said was that we were all going to wear white sweaters or white sweatshirts and white sweatpants and then like have magic markers and we just draw over each other.
2145117	2147258	We're actually, we're actually, I think we do that.
2147278	2150158	We need to do like actual, you know, make like fake uniforms or something.
2150238	2153099	Okay, we would either, if we all walked around in white shirts...
2156079	2162343	If we all walked around in white shirts and white pants, these people would either think A, we're doing Battle Royale, or B, we're the next Heaven's Gate.
2162963	2166925	What was it that was on Loki's old sig?
2167085	2168906	Drink the Kool-Aid and follow the comet?
2169766	2170907	Dot, dot, dot.
2171527	2178471	Seriously, though, we should go back to Q's R. Hey, Rob?
2179271	2179752	Rob?
2180132	2180432	What?
2181687	2182888	Can I ask you guys a question?
2182908	2183148	No.
2183708	2184189	Yes, okay.
2185229	2186931	Did you guys all like your presents?
2187391	2187971	Yes.
2188792	2189152	Yes.
2189773	2191234	Hey, Rob and I are rappin' cool.
2191674	2196837	We got, Angel brought us a Parappa toy that I guess used to be at McDonald's at one point.
2197218	2200200	And you, it's a little keychain that you pull down and it bounces up and down.
2200260	2200680	It's really cute.
2200700	2201461	And he's rappin' cool.
2201681	2205583	And then we have like a guacamole del taco inspired keychain.
2206144	2207104	He said pull down.
2207124	2208185	Should I be afraid yet?
2208966	2210647	I have Pocari Sweat.
2211901	2212903	Angel Rules!
2213143	2213383	Again.
2232352	2234233	We're going to do songs that suck.
2234253	2235694	No, don't pick them from there.
2235774	2236074	Do this.
2236134	2237635	If you want songs that suck, go to this directory.
2237675	2238816	No, I want that song.
2238836	2239236	You do want that?
2239256	2240337	Okay, we're not going to do songs that suck.
2240657	2240978	This one?
2241118	2241378	Okay.
2242118	2242418	Alright.
2244540	2244840	Okay.
2245701	2249183	We'll be back in a little bit and we're going to talk about Bomani News.
2249263	2249803	Oh my god.
2249823	2251965	And then we'll do the FUs of the Week, Cage Match, Match Game.
2251985	2252665	It's all coming up.
2253245	2253786	Thanks for listening.
2268325	2268770	Thank you.
2409626	2410933	Thanks for watching!
2463499	2464969	DarkSakura.com
2507284	2508686	Thank you for watching!
2607631	2611714	From StepSquad to OrangeLabs, this DDR sucks!
2611834	2624282	Holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla.
2636992	2638213	Angel's got the proof.
2639955	2641817	Yes, you have photographic proof.
2642298	2645161	So, um, hi, what were we going to talk about when we come back?
2645221	2647063	Oh yeah, news, Loki, give us news.
2647543	2648224	Hold it first.
2648585	2648885	Rob?
2649265	2649566	What?
2649726	2654571	Photographic proof will be up on www.uncluetomind.tk tomorrow.
2654831	2655232	Hooray.
2657543	2665345	Okay, anyways, with actual news for once, because we've been lacking for quite a while.
2665366	2666466	You big dirty liar!
2667286	2667786	Shut up!
2668987	2679250	Anyways, we're going to start talking about, first thing of course is going to be Max 2, the release is coming out in a couple weeks actually, for the home versions, and I've already got it on order, so that's cool.
2679530	2685772	But what's awesome is it's going to come with yet another VRare, and what's cool is I think this is going to be a hint at some of the stuff that we're going to see
2686472	2690376	as hidden songs in Max 2 and also as stuff that's going to be DDR Extreme 2.
2690896	2692978	So, let's go down the list here.
2693258	2693939	Let's see.
2693959	2695280	This is not what I wanted.
2696141	2696882	Okay, hold on.
2697262	2700185	Let's see.
2700305	2701065	La la la.
2701265	2701566	Oops.
2701586	2704628	And let's see here.
2705469	2705870	There we go.
2705890	2708152	That's the one that we were just looking at.
2708172	2708372	Do do.
2709622	2710302	Yeah, way to go.
2710863	2711223	Here we go.
2711403	2711663	Alright.
2712303	2713704	Now, the songs that will be in there.
2714104	2721848	We've got some, it looks like the Max 2 for the home version is going to be the System SF remix of the whole, you know, series.
2722168	2727430	We've got, first, a brand new song by them, Feelings Won't Fade Extended Trans Mix, that's going to be on the V-Rare CD.
2727731	2732073	Plus three songs that are going to be hidden within Max that are going to be long versions of those songs.
2732413	2737075	We've also got Kind Lady, the Future Trans Mix, Midnight Blades, the System SF Mix, and
2737475	2746923	Glacial, which is the brand new Ryu Kosuka song, and an I Feel New Age Hope mix, which is also by System SF.
2747103	2752348	Because everyone got a big fat Woody over Drop the Bomb System SF mix, now it's like, oh, let's let the dude remix everything.
2754266	2754666	Yeah?
2756068	2756608	Pretty much.
2756809	2758070	Pretty much, I think I summed it up.
2758110	2764076	But these songs right here, I'm predicting it here, you're going to see those all as hidden songs in Max 2.
2764196	2765598	Those are all going to be hidden songs in there.
2766198	2770062	And they're also going to be probably in, um... Let's see.
2772985	2774327	They're also going to be, uh...
2778234	2779354	Sorry, I flashed Jamie.
2780935	2785797	Anyways, there are also going to be new songs for probably the U.S.
2785897	2792679	Macs, too, and also going to be in, obviously, DDR Extreme, too.
2792799	2797621	So look for those, and we'll probably have MP3s as well as Bomani, so have MP3s.
2797661	2802482	They quote six hours after the game comes out, they will have MP3s up on their site, so look for them.
2802802	2803783	They should have the MP3s there.
2804884	2812680	Now also, on top of that, since we're... Actually, I hate to cut you off, but you know, when Max USA came out, we actually went live and played Max USA on air.
2812940	2814002	We'll do the same thing for Max 2.
2814904	2822387	Okay, and let's see now, we've also got, since we were talking about that, more info on Max 2.
2822788	2826349	They've announced some of the playlist, or some of the song lists that's going to be there.
2826629	2837834	It's going to be a lot of, pretty much everything has come back from the arcade version of Max 2, except A Minute, let me see, I believe it's A Minute, The Whistle Song,
2840354	2840814	Ah, shit.
2840834	2842254	There's like four songs that they were cut.
2842314	2844655	Anyways, so those will not be back.
2844795	2849156	There's rumors that they're going to be just, you know, unlocks, but I don't know.
2849276	2855157	There's another picture that they said that they saw a minute in it for the home version, so it's possible it's an unlock.
2855677	2857498	Also, on top of that, you're going to have some of the older songs.
2857518	2862539	You're going to have Kind Lady and So In Love in there, plus, you know, Dynamite Rave and all the old, pretty much all the third mix stuff.
2862559	2863699	All the barfy katas.
2863879	2865499	Yeah, all those that were in there before.
2865819	2869000	And there's going to be some DDR Extreme preview tracks in there.
2869780	2871500	Like, Crash, Hooray
2892649	2899054	On top of that, there's going to be Oni modes as well, and the ability to make your own custom Oni modes.
2899874	2900375	Oh, neat.
2900635	2902276	Custom Onis, that'll be kind of cool.
2903957	2904538	Stop it!
2905118	2909441	The fuck are you doing, this stupid hedgehog flying over my damn head?
2909962	2911823	Or weasel, or whatever the fuck that is.
2913885	2917227	Anyways, so that's what's coming up, we'll have that.
2918008	2918088	Um...
2919082	2923083	Now, aside from all that, I mean it.
2923724	2924824	I'm going to rip that thing in half.
2927425	2927645	What?
2927725	2928825	Am I the Loki in the middle?
2928845	2930086	Am I the Loki in the middle?
2930286	2932146	No, no, no, you're the Loki in the middle.
2932266	2936008	Okay, anyways, so now, let's get to some other news other than that.
2936028	2937968	We'll cover Dancing Stage Megamix in just a second.
2938408	2941730	Really quickly here, moving along, we've got Poppin' Music 9 info.
2943230	2959999	and this is kinda cool, they were talking about, it sounds like it's almost like Bishibashi here, now they have Poppin' Music 9 Imallu, which is, I guess it's gonna be a version of Poppin' Music 9, it's kinda like the powered up versions of Guitar Freaks, where it has, you know, the e-cards that are gonna go in there, you know, the magnetic cards that store all your data,
2960759	2962800	and you're going to have a lot of different modes in there.
2962860	2971464	Like for instance, you can like swap, I guess you can earn items in this game with the scores that you get to buy stuff and you can send it to each other.
2971764	2974986	They have, well let's see, let's get to the actual cool stuff.
2975246	2980729	They've got a mini game in it that's called Bomani that's actually like Beatmania because there's a turntable
2981609	2982449	on this machine.
2982489	2984150	There's a turntable and two keys.
2985311	2986191	Which is kind of weird.
2986231	2987231	Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.
2988952	2993954	They've got another game called Puka Puka, which is in... Sounds dirty.
2995014	2999856	This game, you use the buttons to avoid objects while trying to reach the good, whatever the fuck that means.
3000976	3003117	Yeah, target practice, you know, something like that.
3003457	3004138	Table tennis.
3004298	3006238	It pretty much sounds like bishy-boshy, you know.
3006659	3009219	And they're going to have some songs, new songs.
3009720	3010080	But now...
3011120	3021828	I don't even want to know what's going on behind me, okay?
3022188	3026591	Honestly, I see flashes of light and a stupid weasel thing flying around.
3027632	3030634	I don't want to know what you guys are taking pictures of.
3031415	3032876	Especially since it's around my ass.
3033877	3037898	I'm really afraid to see what that stupid thing is doing to my ass, okay?
3038398	3040999	So anyways, now, Guitar Freak.
3042119	3047320	We've got a lot of Transplant songs from Poppin' Music that are going to be in it, plus some pretty cool shit.
3047340	3053462	We've got Apple and Honey from Poppin' Music that's going to be in there, C777 from Poppin' Music, Impulse of Blue.
3053822	3057863	Now that sounds like Blue Impulse, but you know, I don't know, it's probably a different song.
3058223	3058843	I'm a Loser.
3060664	3063726	We've got the extra stage as being Kaleidoscope by Jimmy Weck.
3064006	3067129	Also, you might remember, he is the guy that did Across the Nightmare.
3067509	3073013	We've also got the encore stage from Dance Maniacs, Mad Blast by The Infection, which is really awesome.
3074734	3077476	Now, bonus tracks, we're going to have some long version songs.
3077496	3082100	We have Dreams in the Night, Twinkle Star, Cries in the Wilderness, and...
3082660	3083721	Party Hard by Andrew W.K.
3101211	3103632	They've also got Show Business by ACDC.
3103852	3104393	Oh, dear God.
3107714	3108734	And Mr. Children.
3108774	3110035	I recognize Mr. Children.
3110375	3113336	Or Crossroads by Mr. Children, I think.
3114317	3116137	But there's some other J-Rock stuff in there, too.
3116237	3119419	I don't know J-Rock, so, I mean, I don't know.
3119499	3120099	Look at the list.
3124841	3126802	Yida Hitomi is the one who did My Sweet Darling.
3129713	3129913	All right.
3130154	3131676	And she has a song called Adante.
3132216	3134519	Now, now that's all out of the way.
3134559	3137142	That's all about Guitar Freaks 9th and Drum Mania 8th.
3137663	3143010	Yes, so now we're going to have... Wow, I'm so moist in anticipation of Guitar Freaks 9th, not...
3146963	3147683	That's just gross.
3148024	3153306	Okay, now, finally, with the list of the songs, the game will probably never play because it's in Europe.
3153887	3154787	Fucking Europeans.
3155407	3157368	They've got a brand new Dancing Stage Megamix.
3157388	3161170	It's going to be basically equivalent to R-Max 2 or whatever.
3161531	3164232	Anyways, it's going to have seven licensed songs.
3164612	3166013	Stealing Beats by Kid Galahad.
3166133	3166593	Never heard of it.
3166993	3168494	Love at First Sight by Kylie Minogue.
3168734	3169134	I have that.
3169175	3169595	We can play it.
3170195	3171416	Love Cats by The Cure.
3172216	3176518	That's so awesome that The Cure gets into DDR and it's a shitty song.
3177219	3180341	When You Look At Me by Christina Milan, whatever that is.
3180741	3181141	Yeah, whatever.
3181321	3186124	Shake Your Body by Shy FX and T-Power featuring DJ Ranma.
3186164	3186424	Whatever.
3187224	3189045	One Step Closer by S. John Jay.
3189065	3189486	Yeah, whatever.
3189946	3191887	And A Little Less Conversation, Elvis vs. JX.
3191907	3195289	A little less conversation, a little, a little, a little.
3195369	3196529	I don't know the fucking words.
3196890	3197810	I'm just going to make them up.
3199751	3204173	They're pretty much going to have the same shit we're going to have on our DDR Max 2.
3204213	3211236	It's going to be all the Konami originals, plus the preview songs from DDR Extreme.
3212037	3212797	Same shit there.
3213697	3215098	But here's where the funny part is.
3215318	3216579	Their unlock system.
3216839	3220200	Their unlock system is a joke.
3220280	3221801	Is it like you just play a song?
3222041	3223201	You don't even have to pass it?
3223241	3224142	You just play it and then...
3225149	3225769	You can unlock.
3225989	3226550	No, seriously.
3226730	3228510	The first unlock is after one song.
3228550	3233672	It unlocks... Let me pull this up because it's really ridiculous.
3234992	3236793	Wasn't it Endless Mode or something that was after one song?
3236873	3237953	No, that's after quite a few.
3239634	3241495	Oh, Records Mode after one.
3241755	3242575	Whoop-a-dee-doo!
3242995	3247797	Obviously it's going to have to be after one because you're going to have to play a song in order to have a record for it.
3248757	3249438	Let's see here.
3250678	3252799	Oh, here we go.
3253059	3257121	After three points, which is basically three unlocks, you get training mode.
3257521	3260603	Six points, you get edit mode.
3260643	3263684	You get ten points and pass 70 songs.
3264965	3269267	You get max 300, 15 points, and 100 songs, so you get endless mode.
3269947	3270508	Whoop-a-dee-doo.
3274471	3275131	What a shit.
3275331	3276011	All right, that's it.
3276051	3276811	That's all the news I have.
3277692	3278992	Yay, that was wonderful.
3279012	3281172	Oh, and if the DDR Extreme OST came out, the non-stop suck ass.
3281352	3281632	That's it.
3282532	3283633	Why does the non-stop suck ass?
3283653	3284853	Because they didn't remix shit.
3285053	3286133	They didn't remix anything.
3289994	3290274	Okay.
3290994	3292774	Now, next up on the show.
3294014	3294755	God damn, you guys.
3294795	3295475	It's a surprise.
3295895	3296115	Okay.
3296995	3300175	What we're going to do, we're going to do the FUs of the week.

3302176	3302596	Give me the ferret.
3302636	3303076	Give me the ferret.
3304953	3310274	You guys, seriously, I'm going to make you all go outside and we'll just, we'll finish the show.

3514313	3515274	He uses the F word a lot.
3515294	3515414	What?

3527666	3532252	Angel got Jamie a happy bunny for her keychain, yeah.

3537259	3538640	The Money Goes in the Dark!
3556345	3559528	Think about what your FUs of the week are now before the microphone gets to you.
3559568	3559969	Thank you.
3561310	3563953	Why am I still trying to pull up the TerraMix of Schlagwerk?
3563993	3564513	I do not know.
3564954	3570279	Okay, let's start it off with the only woman who can start this off, the FUs of the week.
3575004	3577346	I had aches at one moment, now it's all gone.
3588647	3593388	I have to say that the first one would definitely go toward my state of unemployment, not having money.
3594069	3597230	But I will know within this week if I have another job, which I likely will.
3597250	3598390	So it's great for me.
3598730	3600851	And the other one goes toward stupid fucks on the road.
3601411	3602492	I hate them and I want them to die.
3602512	3603992	Not taking me with them.
3607751	3611593	I want there to be the Battle Royale of the Rhodes with me as the victor.
3612173	3614735	And them all lying in bloody burn.
3614835	3615515	Ooh, a tank.
3616055	3616676	Oh, that's right.
3616736	3617456	I need a tank.
3618337	3619017	Somebody give me a tank.
3619417	3624900	And my other view goes toward my birthday is on the 19th, okay?
3625761	3629803	And I can't go do my normal thing that I do because I don't have money.
3629923	3631283	Someone buy me the Battle Royale novel.
3631303	3631624	Thank you.
3633745	3634705	All right, moving on.
3634765	3636066	Let's hear from Loki.
3638334	3642117	Damn it, I missed, uh, I, like, forgot a lot of them.
3642137	3643618	But that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right.
3643638	3650203	Alright, uh, to start it off, um, big F you to the stupid bitch that was sitting next to us.
3650543	3654406	Actually, big bitch that was sitting next to us at the movie theater yesterday.
3654746	3659330	First off, there was plenty of other seats, but no, your fat ass had to move in front of us before the show.
3659470	3660991	But you did before the show!
3661311	3663393	Then her stupid, ugly kid sat next to me, too.
3663893	3664714	And then her fucking...
3665234	3675461	Then after all that, she ended up having her cell phone on during the movie and then it rang and she answered it and started talking and just wouldn't fucking shut up, so I hate her and I wish she'd die.
3677242	3683526	Big F you also to the stupid bastards that drive cars in parking lots.
3684347	3687409	When I'm trying to back out, don't fucking park your car behind mine.
3687769	3691112	The next time you do that, I'm going to back up at full speed and kill you.
3692352	3692753	That's it.
3692953	3693493	Simple as that.
3693513	3696496	Especially if you're just a pedestrian standing there, that's even worse.
3696556	3698497	It'll make it nice and easy for me to run over you.
3699298	3700298	So, um, yeah.
3700719	3703060	So don't get in my way in parking lots.
3703901	3705983	Stop distracting me with all this pencil crap!
3707684	3708264	Seriously!
3708885	3709285	Are you done?
3709906	3710606	No, I'm not done!
3710806	3711887	He bothered me!
3714449	3714990	Are you done now?
3716711	3716851	Um...
3718922	3720444	For now, because I can't remember them.
3720664	3721245	They'll come back.
3721485	3721685	Good.
3722226	3724128	I have a few FUs of the week I'd like to give out.
3724588	3727031	My first FU goes to Daylight Savings Time.
3727391	3727732	One more.
3728993	3729814	No, it's my turn.
3729834	3730134	Hold on.
3730755	3731055	Hold on.
3731135	3731636	We'll go back.
3731656	3732036	We'll go back.
3732316	3734158	My first FU goes to Daylight Savings Time.
3734198	3734799	What the fuck?
3735099	3736281	An hour of sleep lost?
3736721	3740563	because somebody decided we need more suns so the children can play outdoors more.
3740583	3740943	Fuck that.
3741163	3742764	It's not safe to play outdoors more.
3742784	3746605	Rob, actually it's because the year isn't exactly 365 days.
3747005	3749526	And then there's an actual, you know... Wait, no, that's leap years.
3749566	3749866	Never mind.
3749926	3750247	I don't know.
3750467	3751347	I don't give a shit.
3751447	3752628	It sucks my balls.
3752728	3754108	Not every country celebrates it.
3754168	3755089	Why do we have to?
3756009	3757229	I lost an hour of sleep.
3757830	3758310	Lick me.
3759730	3760611	Arizona rules.
3760891	3762852	Okay.
3762932	3763332	What else?
3765795	3768138	Arizona doesn't celebrate Martin Luther King Jr.
3768158	3768438	Day either.
3768458	3769579	They're kind of fucked up.
3771241	3772242	What else am I trying to think of?
3772622	3773263	Oh, there was something else.
3775125	3777868	F you to having a crush and not knowing what to do with it.
3778148	3778649	I hate that.
3779189	3780030	F you to traffic.
3780791	3781512	I hate cars.
3783454	3783814	F you to...
3788195	3789758	F you to zero, he's looking at me funny.
3791221	3791742	I'm just kidding.
3792964	3794006	I couldn't think of anything else.
3794227	3795108	Alright, back to Loki.
3797114	3802898	Um, this is gonna be an F you to pretty much everyone that was not competing in DDR Idol, but the judges for DDR Idol.
3803298	3804899	Listen, you stupid bastards!
3805199	3807340	I worked hours on the fucking audio setup!
3807601	3810943	The reason you can't hear yourselves in the mic is because you're whispering into the fucking mic!
3811243	3812103	Talk loudly!
3812364	3814265	I did sound checks so you can hear people.
3814485	3817026	You're like, I can't hear myself because I'm talking really quietly.
3817527	3818047	Turn it up!
3818267	3818768	Turn it up!
3819008	3820809	Speak louder, you stupid bastard!
3822537	3825019	That news, the guy that played Simon, you really sucked.
3825199	3826180	You pussed out, man.
3827401	3828262	Hey, I like that guy.
3828302	3828742	He was great.
3828762	3829723	Well, he pussed out, man.
3829763	3834067	He was good, but had failure, not had bronchitis.
3834107	3834907	He pussed out.
3835188	3836309	I could have been a better Simon.
3836689	3837089	That's right.
3837129	3839071	I would have hated everyone, so I guess I couldn't have done that.
3839111	3842574	Well, there might be something involving American Idol on this station in the future.
3842594	3843134	Who knows?
3843194	3844275	Ideas are going around.
3844295	3847918	Anyway, so F you tonight, and F you for eBay for having me take it.
3851189	3851650	I'm done.
3851950	3853131	Alright, moving on.
3853191	3854312	Let's go around the room.
3854332	3855453	We'll start with what?
3856094	3856674	Let's start with Tal.
3856694	3857115	He's over here.
3857155	3858036	We'll go this way.
3858476	3859937	Alright, Tal, kick it off.
3860138	3860618	What's up?
3861239	3864942	I'd like to give a nice fuck you to, oh, everybody who's ever gone to Scandia.
3866003	3867104	Except for, you know, my friends.
3867124	3868385	Because we're intelligent people.
3868906	3870127	We know what English is.
3870347	3870948	We speak it.
3871048	3871909	We know how to read it.
3872249	3874431	We know what it means to be able to follow instructions.
3875011	3875292	You know?
3877953	3880514	Yes, this is the best background ever.
3881075	3887417	And I'd like to give a... Dude, there's some seriously retarded people out there.
3887497	3888558	It's so scary.
3888598	3898962	I want to know just how many people, when we came back after the tournament, while I was playing 2DX, how many people came up with that token machine and put money in it when it said, please use another changer.
3899522	3902003	Dude, you know... People are stupid and can't read.
3903147	3909933	and one person was like, oh my god, the machine stopped working and I stopped in my game and said, read the sign.
3911403	3914045	You know what area Scandia is located at, right?
3914065	3916006	You know how many people are illiterate there?
3916386	3919068	Yeah, but people are just as stupid who go to RVGL.
3919248	3923351	There's nothing that's made me want to go back and get my college degree and work in Scandia.
3923371	3925713	At least there are more retards at RVGL than at Scandia.
3926413	3927554	No, dude, seriously.
3928054	3932437	Until you work there, there are people, there are retards that work at RVGL.
3932457	3937121	There's retards at Scandia, and then there's just people who expect other people to do it for them at RVGL.
3937141	3937921	No, no, it's like this.
3938081	3939963	People at Scandia don't have a choice, but people at RVGL do.
3940883	3943244	That isn't even worse.
3943324	3944645	It boggles the brain.
3945065	3947066	And, um, let's see, what else would I like to ask you?
3947607	3948387	Yeah.
3949207	3954190	I'd like to give a nice big fuck you to Gitaroo Man, because I don't have it, and I really, really want it.
3955170	3962374	And it's like... And, um... God, I had a whole list of them today, but I don't remember, so I'll come back.
3962834	3963575	Wait, no, I won't.
3963655	3965355	I'll keep this, because I'm a mic whore.
3966956	3967416	My turn.
3967536	3967837	Okay.
3967897	3967977	Uh...
3971283	3985467	My first lucky goes to being broke because I had to live off $20 this weekend because that's almost all I have left until I get more luck.
3985788	3988108	Fuck you to expiring ATM cards.
3988448	3989709	I've had no money this weekend.
3990449	3994190	Okay, well... It's because it pays, yeah.
3994210	3994810	Okay, thank you.
3995191	3997231	Now, uh... Oh, yeah.
3997271	3999092	Okay, well, anyway.
3999192	3999532	Also...
4001027	4004028	Fuck you to bad grades, because it sucks.
4004448	4009370	Shut up!
4010010	4013431	And also, fuck my bike, because it got another flat tire.
4013951	4015151	You got a flat tire?
4015292	4016292	Yes, on my bike, yes.
4017620	4017860	Yes.
4018701	4023246	And... And fuck the old GPAs for not having lights on them.
4023506	4023847	Put one in.
4023907	4024768	I'll put one in.
4025548	4027931	Yes, I know about the afterburner, and I'm too cheap to get one.
4027951	4031054	So I just use a bike light under my chin.
4032876	4035959	Okay, I'm Ryan for the show.
4037041	4038923	I have, like, a light shield thing, but it sucks.
4042176	4042776	That's a gadget.
4042796	4051280	I have you go to Rob and Jamie for the free show, making retard noises during Daikonkai.
4051320	4060464	Next time you guys go in the middle of a great song like Daikonkai, just kill yourself first.
4060484	4061204	Oh, shut up.
4061644	4062765	Hey, Anita's here.
4062805	4063365	Hey, Anita.
4064305	4064846	Okay, next.
4069541	4075444	Fuck the judges for making me stop in the middle of my Guacamole Del Taco routine.
4075464	4080747	I was like 95% of the way done just because I was like failing my song.
4080947	4081327	You know what?
4081347	4081967	Sorry to cut you off.
4082088	4082988	I fucking agree with that.
4083008	4084269	You paid your money to be up there.
4084329	4085990	It doesn't matter what other people think.
4086030	4086730	You paid your money.
4086750	4087730	You should get to do your dance.
4088031	4090272	The gong is a stupid idea and eat me.
4090912	4091172	Thank you.
4093554	4094414	I wish I had a gong.
4096843	4099252	Fucking single and a bunch of hoes.
4099312	4101822	And I agree with the whole crush thing.
4104497	4105017	It's a bitch.
4105537	4107438	Anyways, no, I got a few fuckies, actually.
4108078	4110399	Um, yeah, fuck you to the judges for stopping you.
4110499	4112280	That pissed me off more than anything.
4112320	4115401	I wanted to get up and, like, just start hitting people, then I want to get sent home.
4115801	4120582	Um, fuck you to losing my voice after doing Orange Lounge all weekend last week.
4120662	4121183	I couldn't talk.
4121203	4121843	You're my hero.
4121963	4125084	I couldn't talk for, like, two days afterwards, but it was fun.
4126484	4127425	Zero's a hero.
4128505	4128945	Shush!
4129425	4131366	No, um, and, uh...
4131986	4138930	Yeah, fuck you to the people who were making fun of the DDR Idol contestants because I really didn't see you guys get up there and do anything.
4138950	4140070	Yeah, let's see you get some balls.
4141171	4142772	Yeah, or something.
4144613	4151156	Um, anyways, this is pointless, it's like microphone juggling.
4151176	4154178	Sorry, I've got to thank Lizzie for bailing me out earlier to save my life.
4155619	4157320	Yeah, um, fuck...
4159016	4166120	Yeah, fuck you to all those stupid bastards who pointed and laughed at me when I stumbled on a challenge that caused me to have a damn breakdown.
4166880	4175505	Um, yeah, fuck you to all the morons in Scandia, well, the, um, whatchacallit, the customer morons that aren't us.
4176305	4181868	Yeah, they're all fucking jackasses that need to just go live at RBGL for a month.
4182008	4182048	Um,
4184142	4187523	Yeah, fuck you for being tired and fuck you for the other same time because I lost an hour.
4188243	4191324	And fuck you to Battle Royale and here's the reason why.
4192164	4194065	We didn't see all the deaths.
4194225	4198226	I wanted to see all of the however many 40 deaths or whatever.
4198466	4200546	I wanted to see each and every one of you in detail.
4200966	4202046	How everyone happened.
4202287	4203687	Some of them you just hear they died.
4204654	4204914	Huh?
4205214	4205954	No, I want to get it.
4206035	4207255	And I want to get the script, too.
4207595	4213137	But anyways, yeah, and fuck you to trying to get your computer networked, because it never seems to happen.
4213337	4214317	Did they get that done yet?
4214357	4215278	Networking the computers?
4215298	4215378	Fuck.
4215418	4215918	Okay, I'm done.
4215958	4216498	Angel's turn, is it?
4228584	4237995	Alright, I'd like to say, fuck you to jet lag, because I haven't been able to... Hey, hey, my floor!
4238375	4238716	Thank you.
4239056	4241139	Oh, it got really quiet in here, how nice.
4243627	4249269	Alright, fuck you to jet lag, because I haven't been able to get used to the time since I got back on Thursday.
4249649	4252250	I haven't been getting any sleep.
4252390	4257891	Ask Rob, because he knows that I only got 25 minutes of sleep last night.
4257931	4266214	Well, wait, that doesn't help, because Black Lab, myself, and Dark Tessia were playing 2DX all night long.
4266254	4266474	Anyway.
4269000	4274563	Anyways, yeah, fuck you to jetlag, and fuck you to airplane food, because it sucks.
4274923	4276864	Not all the time, but this time it sucks.
4276924	4277484	Alright.
4277604	4279965	I'm gonna engage your fuck you to traffic jams.
4280085	4285768	How the hell am I supposed to get from Sacto to Novato within 90 minutes if it's on a two-lane road, 35 miles per hour,
4297737	4300158	Bumper to bumper.
4300218	4301239	That's why we were late.
4302459	4305021	Fuck you to Istanbul.
4305081	4306081	Pussy ass Simon.
4306241	4310523	All of the judges, number one, were gonging DT.
4311364	4315026	Number two, Simon actually passed me.
4315566	4318267	He just completely pussed out.
4322066	4323727	And... I'm Sven.
4324747	4326227	Alright, let's move on.
4327408	4327768	Yay!
4327968	4330729	Well, we have the chatroom FUs, so let's get to the chatroom FUs.
4330769	4339711	Okay, we have... Justin wants to say, FU to Friday night, no one at Scandia, and there was this girl playing DDR, and I was playing with her, but she had no idea how to play.
4340151	4342853	And then I try telling her, and she's like, well, I don't remember what she said.
4342893	4344954	Something in Spanish, because she didn't even speak English.
4345495	4351919	On a good note, I'm getting a free customized CD from LED Records, which is Judy Crystal, Maria Shore, Priscilla, and Rose's producer.
4352419	4355141	And an FU to the troll lady I saw driving with missing teeth.
4358423	4369251	Ness151 would like to say a big hearty FU to DDR Coralville for not giving free tokens, and to LegendOfMax and ParanoiaSurvivorMax for making me lose the feeling in my thumbs for grabbing onto the bar.
4370191	4372172	Bar Raper!
4372692	4373272	Just kidding.
4375333	4376533	We all gotta get some somewhere.
4376593	4377634	Some people get it from the bar.
4377654	4378054	That's alright.
4379794	4384896	SkylineDC505 would like to say F you to term papers and car insurance rates for teens.
4385456	4385916	Ouch.
4389113	4397623	JapanMan would like to say, yayay, fuck extreme for giving me the worst non-stop random all-course La Señorita, Butterfly, Be In My Paradise, and Get Up And Move.
4397964	4398625	Sucks my butt.
4398925	4400066	Sucks ass, actually, damn it.
4401128	4406915	Fuck stupid-ass people at Halo LAN parties that are on your team and kill you because they think it's fun.
4407415	4408437	Fuck yeah, okay, the end?
4412096	4417138	Vandalists would like to say, my FU is for Fred Phelps and his godhatesfags.com website.
4417238	4417818	Thank you!
4417898	4418818	I forgot to mention that.
4418838	4421199	That was my other thing I was going to say FU to.
4421579	4424280	I'm particularly irritated by the following off that site.
4424300	4428182	He gives a link and vandalists feel free to post that in the chat room because it's too long for me to read.
4428662	4431103	But they're going to protest Mr. Rogers' funeral.
4431852	4434274	They're saying that Mr. Rogers is going to burn in hell because he was a sissy.
4434874	4435355	What?
4435395	4448263	These are those radical... They're those radical idiot people at godhatesfags.com and if you ever... They're the people that I want to go after with shotguns just because... Oh my god, there's not a more godly person than Mr. Rogers ever.
4448784	4451666	You can't possibly protest anything the man ever did.
4452461	4454001	Terry, put that link up in the chatroom.
4454021	4454702	They don't believe us.
4455082	4457723	So put that link up and see it for yourselves.
4457783	4460403	Some people out there are very sick and need to go on Battle Royale.
4461864	4470406	I bet you you put people like that who hide behind, you know, something that they've made up, you know, this, this, whatever.
4470446	4472327	I'm not even going to get into the whole debate on here.
4473067	4482913	Not only has he put up GodHatesSpags.com, but he's also put up GodHatesAmerica.com, and he's spoofed God Bless America into God Hates America.
4483614	4485895	And coming up next is... How the hell does he do that?
4487636	4490398	Coming up next is God Hates Bomani.
4492279	4493840	Alright, Fred Phelps, you go to hell!
4493880	4495060	You go to hell, you die now!
4495821	4497042	Alright, moving on.
4497082	4497782	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
4497982	4498222	Yes.
4498783	4500083	Angel wants to say hi to Vandalist!
4500103	4500544	Yes!
4501294	4501654	Thank you.
4502255	4502535	Alright.
4503075	4505777	Yuko would like to say, Okay, my fuck you is to Mark.
4506198	4506858	Whoever Mark is.
4506918	4509400	Fuck you for fucking leaving me at the movies all by myself.
4509480	4511201	Making me walk home in the dark by myself.
4511822	4513143	He needs to die.
4513443	4513943	Yes he does.
4514644	4515104	That's mean.
4515904	4524551	And an F you to my cell phone because it's damn clip has to unclip when I'm running across a busy road so I have to go searching for it when I'm flipping out about it almost being run over.
4526761	4532622	Rice Princess would like to say, fuck you to playing Foundation of Our Love over and over again, change the song.
4533763	4536003	Although she likes that song, I just used it to all hell.
4536243	4536743	My bad.
4537884	4542525	Alright, Vidpala would like to say, F you to homework, F you to getting teacher recommendations.
4543585	4544825	I always thought that was a good thing, but whatever.
4545545	4552367	And F you to not being able to get the turntable on the right-hand side of Beatmania 2DX when I'm playing on first player, but other than that, 2DX is awesome.
4554426	4557951	Hit the white key, then go to save.
4557971	4558191	I'm sorry.
4572529	4573930	Let's use the second player side.
4573970	4575010	Yeah, just do it on the two player side.
4575030	4577392	There must be something, there's some greater scheme going on.
4578052	4578372	I don't know.
4578572	4580493	Anyway, that does it for the FUs of the week.
4580553	4581554	Hooray, we're through it.
4584495	4586596	I feel like just moving right on into the cage match.
4586636	4587256	What do you guys say?
4588177	4588477	Sure.
4588677	4589117	Let's do that.
4589137	4590618	We're going to move right on into the cage match.
4590658	4591679	I've got to queue some things up.
4592319	4595881	Okay, that CD's all ready to go, but I need to queue up this CD as well.
4597001	4601984	So, does anybody else have anything they'd like to say about the FUs of the week while I'm trying to queue up some cage match things?
4607765	4608886	will come up with something.
4610567	4613109	I like traffic, like, oh wait, what?
4613789	4614150	No!
4615090	4615510	No!
4616691	4618553	Throwing ferrets back and forth is fun.
4618753	4619353	Yes, it is.
4620494	4620974	Isn't it?
4621475	4622195	Isn't it fun?
4622215	4624016	Yes, isn't it fun, Loki?
4624357	4624977	Isn't it fun?
4625998	4627599	Oh, you were saying something?
4627999	4629740	Sorry, I was laying at my watch.
4629760	4632422	Ah, screw that.
4633463	4634003	Where's the ferret?
4634023	4635384	I want to throw it somewhere.
4635404	4635905	Give me the ferret.
4639476	4640717	By the way, fuck these lights.
4640737	4641497	They're too bright.
4668976	4672899	I've got a microphone, it's the microphone I have, here we go, into the cage match, ladies and gentlemen, last week...
4696819	4708083	Two weeks ago on the Orange Lounge Radio Cage match, Loki brought in this song called Spente La Selle, and it's pretty cool.
4708483	4709143	And it won!
4709624	4714826	And it's been the winner for two weeks now, because, oh yeah, it's some special mix.
4715986	4718267	Vocal Club Mix, it doesn't say the remixes on there.
4718487	4718887	Here it is.
4719107	4720447	Here's a clip of last week's winner.
4720467	4732530	Oh, the way the cage match works, we play three songs, we only play a clip of the song that won last time, and then you vote, and the song you vote as winner goes into rotation on Orange Lounge with Monty Music and more, which plays all the time on this station when we're not here.
4733591	4733831	Okay.
4734091	4739212	If he's not, if this guy's not leaving, he'd have to, like... Yes.
4739452	4739792	Here it is.
4739832	4741973	This is Opera Trance with Spente Listelli.
4741993	4743853	This is last week's winner, and we're going to play just a clip of it.
4774332	4779414	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
4811460	4816727	Alright, that's last week's winner, or two weeks ago's winner, that's Spente La Stelle by Opera Trance.
4817228	4819711	Okay, moving right along, let's go into Jamie's pick, shall we?
4819751	4820992	Jamie, would you like to tell us about your pick?
4822737	4823597	No, play it.
4823998	4824558	Just play it?
4824578	4825820	You don't even want to introduce it?
4825880	4827602	You don't want to give them the name to vote for?
4827702	4828603	JB sent me this.
4829103	4831265	JB sent you this, but do you want to even say what it is?
4832046	4836671	Wildside Queen of Love Speed Version.
4837512	4839514	Wildside Queen of Love Speed Version.
4839534	4841716	This is the second entry in the Orange Lounge Cage match.
4841816	4842076	Enjoy.
5057533	5058254	and many more.
5092524	5094246	Thank you for watching!
5129578	5136559	All right, that is WildSide, who's... WildSide's been a pretty popular pick in the cage match lately.
5138320	5140900	WildSide has been in the cage match quite a little bit lately.
5140940	5146201	That was Queen of Love, and you might have recognized that as being Bukhwa from 3rd Korean.
5146261	5154503	So let's go around the room and see what everyone thought of WildSide, Queen of Love, starting with Puppy.
5156603	5158684	Sounded like the original version a lot.
5160746	5162627	It's kind of a cool song, but I'd say a 7.5.
5162767	5167871	I think it's a big 5, because it sucks.
5169312	5173294	And I hate Wild Side.
5175415	5177697	And yeah, it sucked.
5177757	5178718	The original was better.
5179218	5182400	Wild Side sucks, because they can't do any of their own songs.
5182440	5184701	They just do covers, and they suck ass.
5185282	5186803	And Sci-Fam sucks as a piss-off TV show.
5189085	5194831	Okay, Santa doesn't suck, but I definitely have a kiss against the wild side.
5195331	5196673	I'll give it a four and a half.
5197514	5197754	Angel?
5197774	5205642	Uh, it did sound like a lot, or not like the original, but, uh, I don't know, it was alright.
5205742	5206563	I'd say four.
5215262	5217384	Man, they weren't kidding when they said everything must change.
5217824	5219205	Including the lyrics, damn.
5219906	5222047	But still, not bad for an experience.
5222087	5223548	I like it cause my Itoko sent it to me.
5223648	5223949	It gets a 12.
5238823	5241844	It's okay, I think a lot of you guys are being too harsh on it, it's not bad.
5243424	5246505	But Kwa's better, it really is, but it's not bad.
5246805	5248085	I'd listen to that on a rainy day.
5248606	5250406	I'd give it a 7.
5251206	5252147	Okay, so.
5252747	5253507	Alright, my pick.
5254727	5255988	I was going to pick a different song.
5256008	5265130	I was going to pick a song... Okay, last night at the party, this guy Garrett, who's new in town, that plays... Well, he's not really new in town, actually, he's lived here his whole life, but he's new to the Sack of Omani scene.
5266251	5269875	We saw him randomly playing 2DX one night and we just kind of sucked him up into our little circle.
5270335	5273018	And it turns out he owns a copy of Amplitude.
5273378	5274039	You haven't met him yet.
5275180	5275440	Alright.
5276341	5279604	He has Amplitude and he brought that over to the little shindig we had last night.
5279965	5283768	And there's a song on there I fucking love by Freeze Pop.
5285510	5287252	It's called Super Sprode by Freeze Pop.
5287552	5288093	However...
5289975	5290455	Can I talk?
5290495	5290955	Can I speak?
5291035	5291376	Can I speak?
5291396	5291816	Can I finish?
5291936	5292356	Can I finish?
5293356	5293537	No.
5293737	5293997	Anyway.
5294757	5297418	But I couldn't find a copy of Super Sprode, which kind of sucks.
5297758	5302480	But I did find another song by Freeze Pop that kicks a lot of ass, so this is my cage match pick for this week.
5302820	5305602	This is Science Genius Girl.
5305882	5309103	And this is my cage match pick from Freeze Pop.
5309543	5310284	So enjoy.
5355986	5357949	It will be a member of my band
5403590	5406513	It will be a member of my band
5430151	5430811	Measure up the chemicals
5458115	5459836	Safety goggles on my eyes.
5459856	5461057	Turn the fountain burner on.
5461077	5461978	My creation comes alive.
5461998	5463239	I have come, a human being.
5463419	5464360	It is here and holds my hand.
5464400	5465901	I have come, a human being.
5465921	5468864	It is now a member of my band.
5468904	5470505	I have come, a human being.
5486215	5502468	It is now a member of my band I have grown a human being It is now a member of my band I have grown a human being It is now a member of my band
5518935	5523496	Alright, that was, I'm being told that's actually in frequency, but I wouldn't even know because I've never played frequency.
5524296	5527117	Freeze Pop with Science Genius Girl, that was my pick.
5527497	5530717	So, let's go around the room, what did y'all think of that?
5530757	5531057	Jamie?
5531377	5532518	One second.
5533258	5534318	I was drinking her Propel.
5537739	5538439	That's what it gets.
5539399	5539779	It gets a burp.
5539839	5541119	A weak burp for a weak song.
5541159	5541839	You suck.
5543400	5543840	Magus?
5543860	5544460	Alright.
5546673	5547473	Not good.
5547493	5547953	Not good.
5547973	5548433	Not good.
5548693	5550074	Eat me.
5550134	5550854	Eat me.
5551154	5552054	Okay.
5552074	5552474	Three.
5553354	5553794	Three?
5554394	5554835	Alright.
5555755	5556355	Freeze Pop.
5556375	5557275	What does Freeze Pop get?
5558275	5558815	TGR Angel.
5558835	5562336	I liked it, except it was kind of making me fall asleep.
5563256	5563656	Whatever.
5563756	5564176	Whatever.
5564196	5568617	Okay, um... Oh my god.
5568657	5569577	Not your turn.
5569797	5570037	Angel.
5572277	5574498	Now you're going last, so you can wait.
5574658	5574878	Angel.
5576869	5583095	I really, I really did like the beat, but, you know... Six.
5583475	5583855	Zero.
5584576	5587018	You know what, she just gave you that sourcing.
5587038	5592403	No, okay, first of all, I don't remember which fucking game that was from.
5592583	5596447	I don't care, I must not, I really must not have paid attention to that crappy-ass song.
5596987	5601211	Okay, I heard the fucking DWI to that, and I thought it was cool for, like...
5602131	5603392	Negative 4 seconds.
5603832	5605454	It was cool before it started.
5605494	5607655	I didn't even know there was a DWI.
5607755	5609717	Okay, the best part about that song was when it ended.
5609737	5612579	I give it a negative 80 million.
5614338	5619062	But don't worry, Rob, though, because, you know, that song that you were talking about earlier is going to win everybody over.
5619322	5619763	Yeah, I know.
5620803	5621044	I know.
5621144	5622765	I'll win it next week for sure.
5625287	5627609	It's not Wildside, and it's not the ketchup song.
5627689	5628810	I'll give it a six and a half.
5628950	5629711	Yeah, thank you.
5632393	5639839	Yeah, um, gee, I wish I could be a wannabe goth girl and hit the keyboard at random and sing a song in monotone.
5641408	5646391	If you had a woman, William Shatner, that would pretty much be pretty close to what that was right there.
5647912	5649073	I mean, and he would be better.
5649433	5650613	Okay, let's just put it this way.
5650674	5655456	I can see why it was infrequency, because it probably cost nothing to license, since it sucks major ass.
5656297	5658578	So, um, I'm giving it a one.
5659319	5659679	A one.
5661020	5661360	Sucks me.
5661600	5665502	I know you people out there who just vote against my song because you try to piss me off.
5666163	5669845	I don't care, because I'll come back stronger, better, faster.
5670933	5671733	Oh yeah, one last thing.
5671953	5675815	As for the previous song, I enjoyed the previous song very well.
5676115	5676596	I give it an 8.
5679917	5688661	Uh, I know this is really, really late and out of segment, but, uh, F you stupid AOL commercials, because, uh, I don't want to see an icon sleep with some ugly hoe.
5688862	5689202	That's it.
5690762	5693004	Okay, as late as that comment was, I'll ignore it now.
5693484	5695385	Of course, because AOL's got a scree anyway.
5697005	5697186	Yes.
5698546	5699267	Shut the hell up.
5699287	5699627	Speak!
5700609	5701531	That song owns.
5702594	5703997	Breezepop owns you.
5705701	5706703	Yes, they do.
5706723	5707325	Ten.
5711602	5714943	I thought that song was pretty good, and I liked it on frequency, so I give it an 8.
5716203	5720765	Okay, now, I give this a perfect score, and let me tell you why, okay?
5720865	5724766	I sat down, and I patiently listened to all your bullshit, and so you're gonna listen to me now.
5725126	5732848	Okay, first off, Freeze Pop, Science Union's girl, band out of Boston, they're playing modern new wave music from the electro-clash school of style, okay?
5733309	5733849	They're ma-
5735209	5738571	These guys fucking own you for free.
5738771	5739411	No.
5739571	5739992	Fuck you.
5740092	5740572	I'm gonna wait.
5740652	5740992	I'll wait.
5741052	5741653	You're gonna wait.
5741713	5742053	Go ahead.
5742133	5742573	I'm gonna wait.
5743133	5743814	Now check this out.
5744294	5747656	Science Genius Girls is a brilliant competition.
5747996	5750197	It's a really well-made new wave song.
5750217	5753539	It's a really well-made modern industrial pop song, okay?
5754247	5756409	The song is really cool, and it's fun!
5756689	5761293	It's fun to play, it makes the game better, and... Yeah, shut the fuck up, Zero.
5761313	5765096	You don't know what the hell you're talking about anyways, cause you're like, OH MY GOD IT SUCKS!
5767138	5768759	The thing is that- Okay, no, hold on!
5768959	5774124	You know what, the only reason why you know all this shit about this band is because you have to make up for how much they fucking suck!
5775405	5776946	If they sucked, I wouldn't care!
5777266	5780349	If they sucked, you wouldn't care- you're carrying right now if they suck!
5781215	5782435	Listen to the song again!
5783136	5784436	I have like seven remixes.
5784536	5785396	I have their album.
5785936	5786577	That's sad.
5787057	5788857	Did you find it in like a five cent bin?
5789238	5789698	Seriously.
5791558	5792559	Seven remixes what?
5792579	5794679	They had to take seven fucking times to make it right?
5796460	5797500	You're a hoe man!
5797660	5798760	You're a hoe!
5798801	5801081	Well at least I don't sleep with my mother!
5803362	5804442	Everyone shut up!
5805263	5806403	Your dog was better!
5808926	5815489	I have nothing wrong with the style, I just didn't like that one.
5816209	5819210	And that's why it wasn't a burp.
5819250	5820911	Rob, the ketchup song?
5821131	5823052	What in the hell did I miss in five weeks?
5823892	5825733	Rob, do you have a hickey on your ass yet?
5826713	5829214	From that side of the room, you got a hickey on your ass.
5839045	5842026	Forgive me for liking people like Fischer Fuder and Creed Paul, man.
5842046	5842726	I go to clubs like that.
5842766	5844167	No one else gives a microphone!
5845928	5849149	The chatroom says Cage Match is turning into an actual Cage Match.
5849169	5849849	Time to vote.
5850749	5851290	Okay.
5851310	5852390	Battle Royale, I win.
5852490	5853971	First song you can vote for.
5854051	5854651	Here's a clip.

5866212	5868894	Alright, next one you can vote for, Wild Side, Queen of Love.
5880501	5884384	Alright, last one, the ever controversial Freeze Pop with Science Genius Girl.
5895017	5895617	All right.
5896578	5897398	Oh my God.
5897538	5899078	Things are going crazy in here.
5899218	5899538	Okay.
5901099	5905740	Send your votes now over private message in the chat room to Sky.
5907000	5908981	No more talking about Cage Match songs.
5909421	5909941	No more.
5910261	5910961	Sit down.
5911101	5911521	Sit down.
5911581	5911981	Shut up.
5912402	5912822	Okay.
5914982	5917523	Sit your ass down in that chair and drink your goddamn tea.
5922293	5923494	It's the Final Fantasy quote.
5923534	5925335	It's the best video game quote ever.
5926216	5926637	It's it.
5927357	5930440	Nice.
5932441	5933062	Dead air!
5933422	5933962	Yay!
5938346	5940868	Sorry, I had to type that out for the chat room so I could see what they were going for.
5940888	5942789	Let's get a little break so that Sanford can calm down.
5943230	5945532	Okay, let's go to a break and everybody's going to be doing some yoga.
5946032	5946933	Everybody's going to do some yoga.
5946953	5950636	We're going to play Journey into Wonderland and Usau Kun.
5951553	5951954	Wait, what?
5951994	5952434	What, Loki?
5952454	5952795	I'm sorry?
5954417	5957001	You have something you want to bring up?
5957041	5957702	Porn!
5958063	5958183	Yes?
5958223	5958644	Not porn!
5959064	5960226	Porn's not depressing!
5960446	5961127	Stupid!
5961648	5966916	No, I was going to talk about how this, actually, Monday we had to put my dog down.
5968893	5969173	Awww!
5970414	5970874	Yeah.
5972055	5974177	She's not seven million years old, she was fourteen!
5975378	5989389	No, we had to put my dog asleep, so we buried her up in, uh, Placerville area, up at some lake or something, and then between these trees we gave her her blanket, and... STOP HANDING ME YOUR FUCKING KEYS!
5991676	6001018	And then we put her bone and stuff in there, so that was kind of sad.
6001639	6003579	At least you didn't take pictures like Oolong.
6005340	6006840	No, not that I'm aware of.
6007000	6007280	Good.
6008000	6010421	I would be wondering about your sanity.
6011781	6012701	But I'm sorry about your dog.
6012921	6013482	That's alright.
6015882	6017803	for me, who doesn't like dogs, I liked your dog.
6018303	6019003	She was cool.
6019263	6039890	But she was old, and she was in pain, so we decided, I mean, she didn't die naturally, we just took her to the vet to have her put her to sleep because she was in pain, and she couldn't walk, and her back legs were going paralyzed, and she had cysts all over the place, and probably cysts on the inside of her, and she was having terrible breathing, and you know, all that wonderful stuff that we were just like, okay, we're just gonna put you down.
6040950	6043292	It was hard having to say goodbye to her, though, before I had to go to work.
6044313	6046174	I had to say a final goodbye.
6046194	6047515	It's sad.
6048235	6054099	Okay, well... Okay, before we turn... Now we've gone from Jerry Springer to, like, Depression Hour.
6054719	6055480	Now it's Oprah.
6055840	6056140	Alright.
6057141	6061443	Okay, but we're gonna play some... We're gonna cool down tempers by playing some mellow songs.
6061463	6062804	We're gonna play some mellow things.
6063805	6063985	So...
6065806	6069189	We will be back, and we're going to play a fun game when we come back.
6069209	6070289	We're going to play a game.
6070469	6072191	Is it called Science Genius Girl Sucks?
6072251	6077394	No, it's called... Let's shove the mic up, Loki.
6077434	6078555	No, no more.
6078575	6080997	Hey, no, no, hold on.
6084393	6085635	I want to see a hug.
6086055	6086716	I want to see a hug.
6087557	6089019	I'm not going to break until we see a hug.
6089299	6089940	I want to see a hug.
6090941	6093063	Come on.
6093123	6093824	There we go.
6094545	6095366	Now that was nice.
6096147	6096928	Alright, here's a break.
6112559	6113122	DarkSakura
6144046	6145167	Thanks for watching!
6176650	6179632	Saku, Saku, Hegatari Shirai Saku, Saku
6201721	6217542	Kawasakuretsu, kyou wa okosukai de, happi na gutsu getto, demo nani kawuka, mayochau nda yo ne
6222143	6250779	I want to eat, I want to have a stomach I want to eat, I want to have a stomach I want to eat, I want to have a stomach I want to eat, I want to have a stomach I want to eat, I want to have a stomach
6255988	6258071	Thanks for watching!
6365580	6366341	Hi, we're back.
6366501	6369563	I forgot to queue up a promo, so we're just back.
6369923	6375727	Actually, I'm going to play one more song because things are a little chaotic right now.
6376568	6383913	We're still trying to set up for match games, so enjoy one more mellow song, and then we'll be right back.
6384013	6385294	So one more mellow song, we'll be back.
6391678	6392279	Mellow Song
6483676	6484917	Orange Lounge Radio.
6485237	6487399	We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
6488200	6492384	This server made up his mind, yeah, number... This server made up his mind, yeah, number...
6495722	6496443	Oh, shit.
6496543	6501414	Okay, trying to get all that stuff worked out for a match game was a little crazy tonight.
6502156	6503118	So many people in-house.
6503218	6503499	Okay.
6504641	6505262	Yes, what?
6507031	6507311	All right.
6508272	6510834	In the meantime, okay, we need contestants for the match game.
6510914	6517439	So the way we're going to pick contestants for the match game would be... Okay, quick trivia question.
6517459	6525905	The first two people in the chat room to message me the answer to this, there's a number in the title of that last song, and that number is whored out in a bunch of Konami products.
6525965	6527046	It's a three-digit number.
6527146	6527646	What is it?
6528427	6533951	First two people to answer me what that number is by private message in the chat room get to be our contestants.
6534511	6534831	Okay.
6536480	6541123	Now, I'm going to announce the winner of the cage match.
6542564	6545786	And drumroll please, the winner of the cage match.
6547947	6556072	By a pretty narrow vote, the votes were pretty well spread out, but believe it or not, Controversy wins, you guys.
6557193	6558514	Controversy wins.
6562333	6565414	I think it was because of the fight, if you guys hadn't gotten all Jerry Springer.
6566655	6567955	Yeah, I think it was the hug too.
6569236	6571817	Okay, so, uh, let's see.
6572798	6580581	Okay, I have one person in, so SnubDisfanoid gets to participate in tonight's match game, and... Oh, VidPower sent a wrong answer.
6581841	6584683	Let's see if we get any other, uh, correct answers.
6585083	6585803	Waiting on one more.
6586303	6587584	Okay, oh, let's see, let's see.
6589827	6591389	Rice Princess wants to know what the answer is.
6591409	6592350	That's what you've got to tell me.
6592410	6597216	The question is, what's the number horned out in all the Konami games?
6598057	6599379	She wants me to tell her the answer.
6600921	6605026	It's a three-digit number, and it's in the title of the last song.
6605046	6605787	I'll give you a clue.
6606107	6606688	Konami.
6609269	6610830	No, Skyline has it wrong too.
6611271	6612752	So we have one contestant so far.
6613213	6614113	Snub Dysphenoid.
6615034	6616035	Nope, let's see, let's see.
6617656	6619858	Nope, Rice Princess still wants me to just tell her.
6623161	6624202	There, we just told you.
6625383	6626684	We just told you the answer.
6627765	6629186	No, Skyline's wrong again.
6630928	6632189	I know we talked about this on the show.
6632509	6633170	Shame on you all.
6635312	6635352	Oh!
6638340	6639381	Oh, let's see, let's see, let's see.
6641062	6642502	There we go, Skyline gets it right.
6642542	6645404	So we have our two contestants, SnubDisnoid and SkylineDC505.
6646985	6648046	The answer is 573.
6651147	6653369	And VidPower was so close, he said 572.
6653449	6655630	Poor guy.
6658591	6660653	And then he said, he said, no wait, no wait, 571.
6660693	6660873	Okay.
6664910	6669171	So, there's our contestants, Snub and Skyline.
6669711	6672852	Okay, now we've got a whole mess of celebrities.
6672872	6675313	We have so many people in here, we've had to tag team some folks.
6675733	6683215	Okay, so, let's go around and... Oh, you know what?
6683795	6686796	You know what's really bad is I don't even have the match game music queued up.
6686836	6689817	So somebody needs to explain how match game works, please, while I look for it.
6690177	6691717	Fill in the blanks.
6692318	6692838	There you go.
6693438	6693738	Actually...
6695001	6703005	Yes, basically, Rob will read off the phrase to you, and then there's going to be a blank at the end of the phrase.
6703265	6704186	You have to fill in the blank.
6705126	6709248	So, yeah, watch the Game Show Network.
6710589	6714230	Anyway, we are going to go around and put down what we think it is.
6714671	6716812	You have to think of how we would answer it.
6718164	6719724	and whoever gets it gets a point.
6719824	6721725	However, if you don't, you're an ultimate loser.
6725166	6735488	And our celebrities today are Rob, me, Angel, um, well, they're a tag team.
6736928	6737768	Um, hey.
6740569	6741449	This dork over here.
6747808	6748549	The freestyler.
6749229	6750130	The other white guy.
6750410	6752972	Yeah, the other white guy and Angel.
6759056	6759356	All right.
6759856	6761818	Needless to say, there's plenty of celebrities in the house.
6761878	6763279	Puppy, yeah, we got it.
6763359	6763579	Okay.
6763979	6765240	Is Joey tag-teaming with somebody?

6774597	6776719	Yeah, Puppy needs help with his answers.
6776739	6777480	You need to tag team with him.
6777580	6778060	Okay.
6781143	6782564	No more fighting, you guys.
6782624	6785147	Seriously, this is turning into an ugly, ugly episode.
6785187	6786588	Just do the game, damn it.
6787669	6789210	Now Jamie's yelling at me.
6789350	6790611	I can't take it.
6790752	6791572	Ow, she kicked me.
6793234	6793594	I cry.
6793634	6794815	Alright, first question.
6794835	6797938	I'm going to have my revenge because Jamie tonight is in two questions.
6801283	6803283	Alright, but first we're going to do a question about Angel.

6835663	6844408	Angel was very excited to be back from Japan, and her buddies in Sacto were excited to watch her carry two big bags of souvenirs through the door to her welcome home party.
6844868	6847950	But they were shocked to find that the bags were full of nothing but blank.
6857335	6859617	I'm waiting on both contestants to give me an answer.
6863399	6863739	Alright.
6866454	6868019	Okay, there's one answer locked in.
6868319	6869503	I'm waiting on one more answer.
6869783	6872350	Angel carried in two bags full of blank.
6876134	6877495	Don't give your answers aloud, please.
6877875	6878175	Alright.
6879116	6880476	I think we have our other contestant locked in.
6881937	6883638	Jesus Christ, it's going to be one of those days.
6884159	6884519	Okay.
6884939	6887080	We have one of those contestants on the show tonight.
6887661	6888001	Alright.
6890482	6891543	Yes, I'm just going to warn you all.
6891563	6892864	We have one of those contestants.
6892984	6893224	Okay.
6893684	6894745	Everybody locked in in the room.
6895445	6895665	Yes.
6895826	6896066	Okay.
6896566	6896966	Here we go.
6898327	6900008	Should I read the contestants first or us first?
6900308	6900909	Contestants first.
6900949	6901229	Okay.
6901769	6902990	SnubDisfinoid says...
6904156	6906718	Angel was excited to be back from Japan.
6906758	6917043	Her buddies in Sacto were excited to watch her carry two big bags of souvenirs through the door to her welcome home party, but they were shocked to find that the bags were full of nothing but dead babies covered in feces.
6920966	6922086	Shame on you, Angel.
6923527	6924588	What about the babies?
6926749	6932052	Skyline, DC 505, says two bags full of nothing but Pocari Sweat.
6933544	6934224	Is that Pocari Sweat?
6934245	6938828	Which is kind of ironic because in reality, yeah, she did bring a little Pocari Sweat.
6940729	6941410	I have my answer.
6941910	6944011	Alright, let's go around the room and see if we have any matches.
6944091	6945693	Jamie, what was your answer?
6945733	6951216	Two bags full of... Two bags full of nothing but metal collars and tickets to a deserted island.
6951457	6954479	Metal collars and tickets to a deserted island.
6954499	6955920	I'm sorry, it's not a match.
6956880	6957721	Alright, moving on.
6958081	6959943	Angel and Magus, what did you guys come up with?
6960003	6962865	Well, so it would be kind of cheating for Angel to answer this one.
6964400	6964680	Fair enough.
6964720	6965800	Bags full of what else?
6966061	6966481	Propel.
6967021	6967761	Propel!
6968321	6970102	Very close, but not a match.
6970122	6970582	No, no, stop it!
6970702	6971082	Dammit.
6971242	6972302	Not a match, sorry.
6972362	6974103	Puppy, two bags full of?
6974723	6975063	Yaoi.
6975543	6976164	Yaoi!
6978544	6979705	No, I'm sorry.
6981725	6983566	Uh, Loki, two bags full of?
6983966	6985286	Iraqi suicide bombers.
6987927	6990068	I don't even know where you can find those in Japan, but whatever.
6990468	6991388	Okay, zero.
6992188	6992869	They're out there.
6992889	6994069	You get them out of vending machines.
6995612	6996112	Zero.
6996293	6996953	They're imported.
6998294	7000776	Unlucky and super lucky weapons to distribute randomly.
7001196	7003557	Unlucky and super lucky weapons to distribute randomly.
7003617	7004518	No, I'm sorry.
7004678	7009421	See, I was going to say the same thing as Jamie, but I knew that she was going to say something about royale reality.
7009762	7011303	So I went with the other great import.
7011643	7014765	A bag full of Chairman Kaga's uniform from Iron Chef.
7016766	7017787	Iron Chef uniform.
7017847	7018087	All right.
7018147	7019088	Let's put used underwear.
7019668	7023751	I was going to say soiled panties, but then, you know, I thought some people might take that the wrong way.
7025892	7029274	My answer is she brought in two bags full of hentai.
7030234	7030834	Sorry.
7032555	7033315	Not a match.
7033655	7034056	Sorry.
7034756	7035076	All right.
7035936	7046121	So, the scores... The score... That is awful.
7046861	7048702	I am so glad that it didn't get picked up on the mic.
7048762	7049842	Oh, my God.
7051123	7052743	I never said they were adults.
7052903	7053964	They could be babies.
7055871	7057512	You are an awful... No, no point.
7057532	7058272	God is great!
7058572	7060193	Saddam will... Yeah.
7060273	7060854	Yeah, alright.
7061094	7061494	Shut up.
7061694	7062735	Alright, moving on.
7063615	7064256	Okay, here we go.
7066977	7067637	Next question.
7067977	7071179	Why am I getting an answer already to a question that hasn't been asked?
7071299	7074561	Oh, Loki is worse than I. Yes, yes he is.
7074661	7075241	Alright, here we go.
7075562	7076182	Next question.
7077572	7080493	Rob and Jamie were getting very irritated.
7080593	7082034	I should say Antal, too, because he's here.
7082194	7083675	So, what's up?
7083915	7091899	Because all three of us are getting very irritated at the shitty service provided to Sakbomani.com by the incompetent web hosts at $1hosting.com.
7092219	7092719	Bitches.
7093219	7096341	They decided to mail them a nice big box full of blank.
7101673	7108378	The three folks that run Sackbomani.com were getting very irritated by the incompetent web hosts at $1hosting.com.
7108799	7112201	They decided to mail them a nice big box full of blank.
7123929	7127231	All right, I'm going to mail him a nice big box full of blank.
7127251	7128472	That's a good one.
7152587	7153808	I think we're going to do that, too.
7155149	7157310	You're going to get a point just for that answer.
7157370	7157670	All right.
7159631	7160691	Is everybody locked in in the room?
7160891	7161472	All right, here we go.
7162252	7168235	The three folks that run sakbumani.com were getting very irritated by the incompetent web host at $1hosting.com.
7168595	7171857	They decided to mail them a nice big box full of Skyline DC-505 says, AOL CDs.
7175322	7175923	Brilliant.
7176323	7176944	Brilliant.
7177084	7177945	Here's another brilliant one.
7177965	7178926	This is the one I was laughing at.
7179306	7183070	SnubDisanoid says, shitty magazines from March Madness.
7186369	7189511	We had a big box of old video game magazines you were giving away.
7189611	7190532	It's a great answer.
7190552	7191533	It's fucking genius.
7191613	7193254	All right, let's see if there are any matches.
7194855	7195776	Here we go, Jamie.
7196156	7197557	I would send them in a box.
7198638	7203081	The severed heads belonging to their head tech with a grenade in his mouth.
7203981	7204502	Beautiful.
7204962	7206123	Another Battle Royale answer.
7207464	7209325	The tag team of Angel and Magus.
7212227	7212907	Poopy!
7215643	7220485	Wow, synchronized poopy.
7221205	7221945	I hear a doorbell.
7222705	7222986	Goodie.

7225626	7226307	Oh, Jonas is here.

7477633	7478974	It's a match.
7479415	7480776	Because they're Korean Funyuns.
7480916	7483178	So, Skyline gets a point.
7483278	7483718	Hooray.
7484038	7485199	One point for Skyline.
7485299	7485640	Alright.
7487261	7487882	Moving on.
7488742	7490264	Angel and Magus, what did you guys say?
7490304	7492726	Zero went straight for the... We stick with the classic.
7493066	7493606	Yowie.
7493826	7494407	Yowie.
7495007	7495528	No, I'm sorry.
7495548	7496168	That's not a match.
7497029	7497489	Puppy.
7497629	7498911	They wouldn't sell Yowie that cheap.
7501733	7502994	Puppy, he went straight for the...
7504494	7507916	Those two preteen bimbos that were following him around at March Madness.
7508016	7510498	The teen bimbos that were following him around at March Madness.
7510518	7511338	I'm sorry, that's not a man.
7511358	7512179	They were that cheap.
7512779	7515401	And actually, they were checking you out more than they were checking out me.
7515481	7516662	So, have a good day.
7517042	7517722	Hey, man.
7520384	7520824	Loki.
7522145	7531031	Went straight for the... Okay, now the original answer of Iraqi Suicide Babies is now being replaced with Funion Flavored Pringles.
7531653	7532974	Funyun-flavored Pringles.
7533254	7534255	Is that a match, you guys?
7534315	7534515	No.
7535095	7535435	No?
7535455	7536996	They're Pringles, not Funyuns.
7537657	7539198	They're Pringles, not Funyuns.
7539938	7540658	And they're not rings.
7540759	7541399	All right, fine.
7541419	7542139	So it's not a match.
7542179	7542520	Sorry.
7542660	7545722	We already kind of had to stretch it to get the last one, so... All right.
7546422	7547302	Okay, Zero.
7547403	7548343	What did Zero go straight for?
7550191	7552132	Shining Explosive Necklaces to get out of this game.
7552472	7554613	Shining Explosive Necklaces to get out of this game.
7554653	7555674	I'm sorry, that's not a match.
7556854	7560396	Dave filling in for Shibam.
7562036	7562657	Yes, I can.
7563597	7563877	Dave?
7564237	7567859	Okay, he went straight for the neck of the cashier that was working there.
7568219	7569860	Straight for the neck of the cashier.
7571781	7573501	Alright, straight for the neck of the cashier.
7573982	7575342	Yeah, no, the bagger was worse.
7575622	7576543	Okay, my answer...
7578303	7579804	Zero is such a silly intern.
7579844	7588591	Last night when he was asked to go help shop for snacks, his friends were surprised when they walked into the 99 cent store that Zero went straight for the 99 cent hookers.
7590473	7593976	God, nobody said, nobody said 99 cent hookers.
7594276	7594576	Alright.
7596398	7599300	One point for Skyline, no points for Snub Dismoyed.
7599320	7600441	But here's your chance to catch up.
7601762	7602863	Two questions to go.
7603603	7604304	Alright, here we go.
7605725	7606446	Next question.
7608416	7615737	The March Madness tournament in Sacramento was such a great success, but a special message to all those of you that came out and participated.
7616298	7619158	Next time, please don't make us clean up your blank.
7624639	7631020	The March Madness tournament in Sacramento was such a great success, but a special message to all those of you that came out and participated.
7631420	7634021	Next time, please don't make us clean up your blank.
7636588	7642553	March Madness Tournament Sacramento, great success, but special message, next time, please don't make us clean up your blank.

7669790	7670672	Waiting on one more.
7671132	7672314	Waiting on one more contestant.
7673396	7676020	Next time, please don't make us clean up your blank.
7676120	7679566	Are all the celebrities locked in?
7680027	7680267	Yes.
7680668	7681209	Yeah?
7681269	7681970	Oh, puppy's almost done.
7685516	7685876	Okay.
7687097	7687637	Puppy, you in?
7689258	7700644	He's writing, he's writing, he's writing, writing, writing, still writing, writing, and, and, and, he is almost done.
7701124	7701404	He's done.
7701444	7702005	All right, there he goes.
7702025	7702365	Put it down.
7702385	7702745	All right.
7704026	7705206	Wait, did they send new answers?
7705886	7706447	Okay, fine.
7706927	7707527	Okay, here we go.
7707587	7708388	The contestant said...
7709028	7714013	The March Madness Tournament in Sacramento was such a great success, but a special message to all those of you that came out and participated.
7714414	7717957	Next time, please don't make us clean up your... Snubdisfanoid says, poop.
7719419	7720740	Please don't make us clean up your poop.
7722082	7724844	Skyline says, please don't make us clean up your crap.
7726826	7729449	Is there a... Now, there is a difference between crap and poop.
7729849	7730070	Poop...
7730956	7732137	Crap could be anything.
7732197	7736341	Crap could actually mean crap, or crap could mean like your stuff that you left running around.
7736621	7737803	Poop is pretty narrow.
7738103	7740685	There's only one thing that could be considered poop.
7741406	7745470	It depends, you know, well there's several animals that could have pooped, but you know, poop is poop.
7745690	7750755	Crap could be poop, plus several other things, so I think Skyline has the edge on this, but we'll see, we'll see.
7751295	7752697	Let's go around and see the answers.
7753697	7754058	Jamie?
7754881	7760664	Please, next time, don't make us clean up your... Blood from their jugular veins is their collagen's blood.

7791725	7795072	Alright, Loki, please don't make us clean up your... I've got yellow fever.
7798663	7799244	That's my answer.
7799484	7800305	You know what, Loki?
7800325	7802687	That would have been twice as funny if you'd used SARS.
7803468	7803988	But you didn't.
7804529	7805029	SARS?
7805249	7807472	That disease in Asia that's going on in the world.
7808873	7809313	Almost.
7809453	7809854	Almost.
7810014	7810334	Okay.
7810414	7812657	It's a joke from the... You can't see.
7813718	7814518	Alright, moving on.
7814578	7814839	Zero.
7817099	7821481	I said, don't make us clean up your shitty shorts after the judges review a new one.
7821861	7824762	Shitty shorts after the judges review a new one, isn't that lovely?
7825262	7826543	Lo and behold, what was my answer?
7826883	7828564	Don't make us clean up your crap!
7829184	7830464	Don't make us clean up your crap!
7830484	7831305	I had to, damn it!
7831425	7836147	You said crap, that is an exact match, an exact match with Skyline, beautiful.
7838288	7841389	Now it's 2-0, well let's see if SnubDisco can catch up here.
7842790	7846131	I said, please don't make us clean up your sweat.
7848177	7851278	Because you guys sweat a lot when you play DDR and you need to wear deodorant.
7851378	7851638	Okay.
7854558	7854939	Alright.
7856619	7860380	So, two points for Skyline and no points for Snub.
7860460	7861240	But that's okay, Snub.
7861260	7861840	Here's your chance.
7862380	7863621	Here is your chance to catch up.
7864361	7868022	And you've been bitching about the Battle Royale references all night long.
7868062	7868622	Well, here you go.
7868662	7870442	This last question is just for you to catch up.
7870602	7871202	Okay, here we go.
7872243	7874103	Jamie, I promised two questions about Jamie.

7913045	7915046	Alright, we have one contestant locked in.
7915406	7916507	Ooh, excellent answer.
7916667	7918228	Excellent, excellent answer from that contestant.
7920549	7922490	Too bad we're not as smart as the contestants.
7925512	7931416	Alright, I think... Okay, fair enough.
7931576	7932797	Good answer from both people.
7933117	7934558	Are all the celebrities locked in?
7937244	7937444	S.I.

7942466	7944986	Are you guys done over here, tag team?
7945446	7947847	You know, suddenly Angel's looking more and more attractive.
7950248	7950468	Huh?
7950488	7952868	I just wanted to know what you said.
7955663	7956043	Great.
7956843	7957804	Okay, alright, here we go.
7959324	7960905	Alright, so all the contestants are locked in, yes?
7962005	7963386	Are you, are you half birds finished?
7964907	7965967	Don't, okay, here we go.
7966907	7968248	That's my favorite thing the angel does.
7969328	7969588	Don't!
7970629	7971869	I hate you just as once.
7972590	7973610	Did you hurt like that much?
7976331	7977051	Ow, that hurt!
7977231	7977532	Meanie.
7977552	7978612	Alright, here we go, here we go.
7982717	7983838	Contestants, here we go.
7984218	7985939	Snub's got to catch up, and here's his answer.
7986339	7989141	Jamie won the Bomani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night.
7989201	7992602	Her secret weapon was her remote collar exploder dealie.
7993783	7994363	Good answer.
7995564	7995904	Okay.
7996324	8000647	Jamie won the Bomani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night.
8000727	8006550	Her secret weapon was her Skyline says... Oh, he changed his answer.
8006650	8008011	I think his first answer was better.
8008712	8013837	He said Orange Bat, which is a great answer, but he changed it.
8013917	8015618	His new answer is Boomstick.
8017380	8020442	So we have Remote, Collar, Exploder, Dealey, and Boomstick.
8021363	8023084	Alright, Jamie, what's your answer?
8023325	8023865	Orange Bat.
8023945	8024706	Orange Bat!
8026327	8027207	I knew it, too!
8028068	8030728	That's right, you're already in the lead, Skyline, you don't need it.
8031569	8034049	Alright, as Snub goes, yes, I still have a chance!
8034229	8036590	Okay, our tag team, lovely tag team of Magus and Angel.

8039111	8040431	Her big black cock!
8040471	8041492	Dun dun dun!
8043672	8044733	Sorry, that's not a match.
8045113	8045533	But funny.
8046193	8046533	Puppy.
8048034	8048894	The ferret!
8049254	8050014	The ferret!
8051015	8052175	Good answer, but not a match.
8056541	8065188	Loki, her secret weapon was her Iraqi suicide babies.
8065888	8067129	Iraqi suicide babies.
8067769	8068770	Jamie, is this true?
8070511	8071132	I admit it.
8071512	8072613	I've been exporting them.
8072733	8074354	I keep them in my trunk.
8076736	8077757	All right, in your trunks.
8077977	8079158	Dear God, what about the children?
8079178	8079818	What about the children?
8079878	8081199	All right, moving on.
8081259	8081639	Zero.
8082060	8082760	Her paper plate.
8083000	8084842	Her paper plate, the real answer.
8086269	8086909	The true one.
8087389	8088109	And the magic marker.
8089030	8089310	Alright.
8093771	8096071	And the damn candlestick she jabbed me in the head with.
8096991	8097331	Alright.
8097471	8099472	In the study with Colonel Mustard.
8100372	8101812	Here we go.
8102292	8104573	Dave, who's filling in for Shiva.
8104653	8108013	Yeah, her secret weapon was her extremely high-pitched voice.
8108994	8109534	I hear it!
8109614	8110734	It's mine!
8110794	8111434	Do it!
8111454	8111794	Do it!
8111814	8111954	No!
8118357	8119377	Shatter, shatter, shatter.
8120757	8125218	I'm surprised, that reminds me of a story you told me earlier this week, and I'm surprised it was not your FU of the week.
8126619	8127219	You bitch.
8127979	8131739	Alright, anyway, my answer, yeah, I got carrot.
8132900	8136620	For the record, Jamie does sound like a younger person on the phone.
8136700	8137781	Okay, fuck you.
8138941	8141121	I have to get to that, I have to do another fuck you after this.
8141561	8142061	After the break.
8148396	8149057	But you know what?
8150058	8152400	It just goes to show that looks can be deceiving.
8153661	8154642	Because she's pure evil.
8156824	8157625	All right, my answer.
8157965	8159046	Let's finish this damn thing up.
8159626	8161288	Only three people are going to get this joke.
8162789	8166252	But I said Jamie won because of her cock snacks.
8169696	8170376	Cock snacks.
8171758	8172178	All right.
8174835	8176076	Skyline, two points.
8176156	8177296	Snub, zero points.
8177357	8178897	Skyline is the winner!
8178937	8179798	Yay!
8181059	8182760	And what does Skyline win, Jamie?
8184280	8184941	This carrot.
8186282	8187182	That you just ate.
8189043	8190384	You win a shiny new collar.
8193286	8195547	Alright.
8198088	8198509	Alright.
8199669	8201090	Okay, it's... Nice to meet you.
8203211	8207275	I got a call from a telemarketer yesterday after I had been in a wonderful mood.
8232112	8235694	and, and I, I answered him, hi!
8236214	8237574	You know, like I always do when I'm really happy.
8239575	8242156	And I was, it's like, hi, can I speak to your mommy?
8243597	8248139	My response is, fuck you, you go die, you motherfucker.
8248839	8250120	No, you can't talk to my mother.
8252121	8255042	And, I was like my number one pet peeve, okay?
8255802	8257103	And so, um, he was like,
8258425	8259166	What are you, 12?
8259226	8260527	Is that any way for a little girl to talk?
8260547	8261268	Let me speak to your mother.
8261829	8265372	I'm like, like, what did I say?
8266193	8268496	Oh yeah, go to hell and opt me out.
8268596	8269257	And hung up on him.
8270298	8273121	Opt me out being the way that, you know, they don't call you back.
8273561	8274082	Those who don't know.
8274262	8276444	If you want to get rid of a telemarketer, ask them to opt you out.
8278927	8280348	That was Storytime with Jamie, everybody.
8280388	8280709	Yay!
8282711	8286113	I'm really not that bad with telemarketers because Dan had to do that for a little while.
8286433	8294319	And I'm really patient with them usually, but that is my number one pet peeve is people tell him, you remember it on Under Sedation?
8295500	8295920	All of you.
8296200	8298902	So you get a fuck you too, but not recently.
8298942	8300083	Hey, you should have done this, you man.
8300343	8301284	Oh, hold on just one sec.
8302045	8302365	Hi.
8303225	8304366	Uh, fuck yourself in.
8304386	8304887	Fuck me up.
8306733	8307654	Okay, I'll put it this way.
8307694	8314663	I know you guys hate telemarketers, but I remember when I had to do telemarketing, we hate it more than you guys hate us having to do it.
8315383	8320810	It's totally tedious work, and it's stupid, and people hate you because you have to call them, but that's your job.
8321631	8324835	And it really sucks ass.
8325115	8325836	He was rude, though.
8326456	8326677	Yeah.
8327293	8334357	Well, yeah, it was just like, you know, like, we hate doing it more than you guys hate us calling you at 6 o'clock, right, when you're in the middle of dinner.
8334738	8340921	Like, the best time is when you're calling, when people are saying grace for dinner, because you'll hear Jesus Christ come out of their mouth.
8341442	8342442	It's the best thing ever.
8343243	8343463	No.
8345144	8346505	Or after they're done watching The Ring.
8346985	8347846	No, no, no.
8349073	8351074	Normally, like I said, I'm fine with telemarketers.
8351114	8353254	I'm normally, you know, just fine as I can be with them.
8353895	8356415	But that, I don't sound like I'm 12.
8356956	8358216	I don't know how I sound like I'm 12.
8358536	8359316	Even when I'm happy.
8360197	8361317	Do I sound like I'm 12 when I'm happy?
8361337	8363258	Shut up, Robbie.
8363658	8365118	I didn't say a goddamn thing.
8365158	8366299	I'm just looking at you.
8366939	8367859	I'm gonna go now.
8367919	8368479	I have to go back.

8797153	8797633	We're back.
8798533	8801074	And that music means it's time for Ask Orange Lounge.
8803854	8805115	Or you can ask one of our guests.
8805155	8808155	And I've only gotten two questions so far, so we need more questions.
8808935	8811036	If you're listening, for the love of God, submit a question.
8811456	8812116	Puppy, you're leaving?
8812216	8813976	Oh, you're getting a ride to Davis and Towel?
8814556	8814796	Cool.
8815236	8816077	One less person I have to take home.
8816097	8816337	Bye.
8817457	8817737	All right.
8818517	8819997	I love you, puppy.
8820857	8821077	Bye.
8821257	8821498	Okay.
8823638	8823938	All right.
8825993	8826954	If you want, that'd be awesome.
8827415	8827635	Yeah.
8828255	8828556	Okay.
8831078	8833020	Uh, I really don't want to because it's just so much.
8833160	8833561	Yeah, okay.
8833581	8834021	Hi, anyway.
8834442	8834662	Yes.
8835042	8836103	Okay, Ask Orange Lounge time.
8837164	8840948	Now, before I get to Ask Orange Lounge, I'll give people time to submit more questions for anybody.
8841863	8843844	You can ask Angel, who's just been to Japan.
8843864	8845205	You can ask her about something she saw there.
8845245	8847966	You can ask Angel and Megas personal questions.
8849007	8851328	You can ask Joe about his routine.
8851388	8854069	You can ask Loki about why he's such a bastard.
8854449	8858411	You can ask Zero about Xerox or whatever.
8858471	8861213	You can ask Anita about being cute.
8865895	8868657	I'd like to comment on her quote yesterday in the chatroom.
8868697	8869277	It ruled.
8871468	8872488	You can read that off, by the way.
8874729	8877990	The quote was, bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity.
8878410	8879771	Also, I want to say hello to Jonas.
8879791	8881911	Let's talk to Jonas for a bit while people are submitting questions.
8881951	8882431	Give it a minute.
8882911	8883692	Jonas, how you doing?
8883932	8884532	I'm doing okay.
8884552	8885712	We didn't get to talk to you about the tournament.
8886032	8886813	How did you feel about it?
8887353	8887813	March Madness.
8888273	8894715	First of all, I felt this was the best tournament I've ever participated in.
8894735	8895875	Everything was all set up right.
8897556	8898476	Especially for PA.
8899717	8901137	Though, some people were complaining about
8901826	8904070	About having a 10-footer, you know what he said, any song?
8904110	8904210	Yep.
8907293	8911614	I think some people should, um, were complaining about putting, make it no 10-footers.
8911634	8913915	The score was like the easiest 10-footer of all time.
8914355	8919357	You know what's interesting, though, is that, um, the way Mike seeded is he didn't seed it just by score.
8919437	8924059	Some people that got, that screwed up their combos on bag and stuff got seeded lower.
8924119	8930081	If they got more than like 50 grades, he threw them in the bottom, saying, you know what, don't do that shit, which is pretty cool.
8930621	8931441	I know, I know.
8931461	8936063	That's why I picked bag, because of what they said about the rules, but, well, it doesn't matter anyways.
8936083	8936783	They're, they're,
8937361	8941525	The PA was like so close and everything, especially when you got the one perfect win.
8943107	8944889	Remember, you won by one perfect win.
8944969	8946570	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8946631	8957121	Again, that's the second tournament I've done that at, so I don't... Now this is the thing, I'm being called the... No, it wasn't Loki, it was ShortyMC that I ended up upsetting, and now they're all calling me the upset king.
8957361	8960625	I'm like, how the fuck am I the upset king if I keep winning?
8963004	8963585	No, I'm just kidding.
8963605	8964467	I don't have any ego like that.
8964968	8968534	I honestly, both times, both times was a huge surprise.
8968554	8969616	It was a huge surprise both times.
8969636	8971579	And I know who you are.
8972100	8973082	I think I get...
8974684	8981407	When you were portrayed as Dr. Dick Oh yes, my alter ego Dr. Dick I know who I am, I know who I am, do you know why?
8982228	8994694	The video is going to embarrass my mother Video of the actual freestyle routine is out Don't waste your time downloading it It sucks Wait for the whole thing Wait for the official videos that are going to have the whole thing The introduction
8995354	8998036	and the follow-up, because the routine itself sucks shit.
8998096	9002760	Although, as I found out, just moments ago, I came in seventh place.
9002980	9005222	Dr. Dick, I should say Dr. Dick came in seventh place.
9005662	9012087	Which means, if one of the top six flakes, I'm going to Power Station and I have to do a freestyle.
9014169	9016591	But, we'll find out what your song is somehow.
9018330	9021453	And of course, you may not want the improv because this is an actual power station.
9021473	9023535	Well, it could be a Two-Face person saying, half-sky, half-dick.
9023796	9024817	Okay, half-spanky, half-dick.
9040518	9040798	Okay.
9042379	9043019	So, anyway.
9045120	9045400	Alright.
9045980	9046980	Ooh, the buzz went away for a minute.
9047380	9047820	And it came back.
9048921	9049201	Alright.
9049921	9051502	Every time we say, ooh, the buzz went away, it comes back.
9051542	9051762	Alright.
9052102	9055523	By the way, March Madness was not the only big tournament that happened.
9055823	9057784	I know it's the one we've only been talking about.
9058784	9059165	I've heard.
9079560	9081621	Second place, Dancing Jedi.
9081881	9083802	He's like the Tigger up there, you know, he wins a tournament.
9083902	9084602	Oh, surprise!
9084982	9088884	So that's why, oh, if he comes to B3, which I hear he is, it's going to be a great showdown.
9089244	9089804	Oh, yes!
9089824	9091705	That's going to be beautiful.
9091725	9091825	Yes.
9091885	9092946	I'll let Yasuo and Take come.
9093386	9094486	Oh, I'll wet my pants.
9094626	9098468	Alright, third was Unblinking Eye, so congratulations to Top3 in Tech there.
9098888	9104691	Oni, first place was Dancing Jedi, second place was GPF Lith, and third place was Cynic.
9104711	9105311	Good job, you guys.
9106090	9106550	Challenge.
9106731	9107331	Now, this is cool.
9107371	9110934	I am surprised that the Challenge competition has never been ripped off here in NorCal.
9110994	9111434	Just wait.
9111975	9115117	Maybe we'll rip that off at the next SAC tournament.
9115718	9119761	If you remember Challenge from 4th Mix and Extra Mix, they do a competition that's all about that.
9119781	9121922	Like, how many goods can you get on this song?
9122423	9125425	Or how many perfects can you get not looking at it or whatever?
9125465	9126726	Like, all this crazy stuff they do.
9126746	9127767	Oh, yeah.
9128467	9129368	And it's interesting.
9129388	9131750	But this is interesting because the Seattle tournaments, they're all PA.
9131770	9135413	There's no freestyle because I guess they can't freestyle or whatever.
9135453	9135753	I don't know.
9136333	9136834	You never know.
9136854	9138695	They're going to prove us wrong at B3, I bet you anything.
9138736	9142419	They're going to all put their heads together and just give this kick-ass freestyle.
9142439	9143680	They'll just put everything else to shame.
9143860	9146122	You got people around the U.S.
9146162	9147443	freestyling hella good.
9147603	9150266	They get from Omaha, they get from New York.
9151522	9153703	Hell, it actually can happen.
9153963	9159004	First place in challenge was Krakoon, second place was Dancing Jedi, and third place was Cynic.
9159564	9160324	Good job, you guys.
9160844	9162365	All right, so that was the DDR Magic Tournament.
9162385	9164685	And I guess there was a tournament in Florida, and Tigger won a machine.
9164765	9165445	Yes, he did.
9165625	9167786	Nobody was paying attention to that tournament, so they don't get a shout-out.
9167806	9168506	Tigger wasn't there.
9169966	9173287	If somebody can give me information on who plays that tournament, I'll gladly read their names.
9173367	9174348	Okay, get to the Q&A.
9174928	9176588	Chatroom's demanding we get to the Q&A.
9176628	9176988	Fine.
9177388	9178409	Booster questions, please.
9178609	9180149	We start with Rice Princess.
9182558	9185279	Rice Princess wants to know, what is DJ Taka's real name?
9187160	9187520	I don't know.
9197404	9201208	She says she found out already, but we're challenging ourselves now.
9202889	9206713	Oh, Rice Princess has it, but let's see if Loki can find it.
9208795	9209496	Now it's a game.
9211518	9218445	Are we as smart as the chatroom?
9218985	9219726	I have the answer.
9219906	9221688	Should I just... Oh, Dark Tetsuya, you know...
9222932	9224673	Takeyuki Ishikawa.
9225654	9226135	Beautiful.
9226175	9226635	That's it.
9226875	9227996	That's what Rice Princess has.
9228036	9229217	Takeyuki Ishikawa.
9229818	9230278	Beautiful.
9232460	9234461	Angel says hi to Rice Princess, too.
9235502	9236383	Actually, say it, right?
9236423	9237664	Because Ishikawa is his last name.
9240646	9241247	Bye, Joe.
9242088	9242748	Thanks for coming.
9245730	9246111	I'm out.
9246131	9247072	Any final thoughts?
9247732	9248413	I need a day.
9248953	9249353	All right.
9249634	9249954	Thank you.
9251243	9256388	But I bet you didn't know that V was co-opted by DJ Taka and Antonio Vivaldi.
9258129	9260691	No, I kid you not, it's in the case notes.
9261732	9267257	Seeing as you know Vivaldi is the classic piece that is based off of him.
9267377	9269759	Vivaldi's, Vivaldi's winter?
9270040	9270540	Hello.
9271101	9276545	Alright, alright, alright, alright, here we go.
9277006	9277086	Uh...
9280956	9282337	I slept with Mr. Brian once.
9282417	9283357	Okay, here we go.
9283417	9283637	Shh.
9283898	9285238	Alright.
9285338	9291722	Rice Princess says, What is that white slab in my can of beans?
9292703	9293063	Pork.
9294724	9295144	Pork.
9295705	9296065	Fat.
9297366	9299067	The other white guy.
9299107	9299787	I'm sorry, Zero?
9300048	9300788	It's pictures.
9302029	9304911	It was the other white guy who played Let It Be.
9304931	9305131	Yeah.
9308723	9311724	Because he's influenced by Dark Sakura.
9337927	9339469	Yes, because we're his friends.
9339609	9340770	That's why he rules so much.
9340831	9341451	That's the answer.
9342132	9343714	He rules so much because we're his friends.
9344094	9344395	All right.
9346057	9353145	SnubDisanoid says, Why, in the name of God, did I have to get two greats on Never Let You Down?
9354086	9354767	Because you suck.
9356048	9356449	I'm kidding.
9358376	9371261	you got two greats, I'll never let you down because you weren't concentrating and next time your neck gets blown off because you had to pee and you can't pee when you have to pee alright, SnubDisanoid also wants to say to Angel
9373405	9380509	Did you get to ride the, and pardon my white pronunciation of this, Shinkansen, the bullet train?
9380549	9381370	Did you get to ride the bullet train?
9381510	9386473	No, but my father and my friend did on the way over to where we were.
9387273	9387713	That's cool.
9387873	9388414	Did you get to see it?
9388454	9389474	Did you get to hear them honk the horn?
9390555	9391175	Uh, no.
9391495	9392736	We have little trains over there.
9393056	9395898	They got to see, like, Hiroshima and, you know...
9398070	9400353	All the little sites while they're coming down.
9400593	9405278	Except it took them like 10 hours to get to where we were.
9408002	9409884	Oh, and SnubDisanoid says, you know what?
9409964	9410765	Hey Jamie, you know what?
9411225	9412807	SnubDisanoid, he did have to pee.
9413528	9414009	Amazing.
9415954	9417174	Miss Cleo, live in the house.
9417254	9417574	Alright.
9419155	9423536	Justin would like to say, how many people would like these songs in full version?
9423556	9427477	And then he lists all these fucking songs I'm not going to read, but there's a lot of Judy Crystal.
9427577	9428197	I'll be on tonight.
9428317	9431198	And Rose, Judy and Priscilla, Maria Short.
9431738	9432558	I'll be on tonight.
9434159	9436699	Just, yeah, of course we want them, you fool.
9436819	9437159	Send them.
9439140	9440940	Ah, Rice Princess has another great question.
9441400	9443301	Haven't any of you seen Ren and Stimpy?
9446038	9447520	There must have been a reference I missed.
9449882	9452705	It's all about the brand new episodes on TNN.
9453165	9453606	Yes, that's right.
9453626	9455328	They bought the rights for it and they're making new episodes.
9456529	9457410	This is amazing.
9458170	9461734	For the first time in my life, I watched SpongeBob SquarePants.
9463156	9464197	Never seen it, never will.
9464397	9465498	It's pretty fucking funny.
9465538	9466319	I think you're missing out.
9466359	9466979	It's pretty funny.
9467420	9468101	I was impressed.
9469466	9469786	Eat me.
9470146	9470466	Alright.
9470526	9473047	You have got me watching Invader Zim now.
9473807	9473947	Oh.
9475107	9476248	Well, I've been downloading them.
9476528	9486030	Rise Princess says the correct answer to the bean question was, it's the queen bean and the rest are worker beans.
9486110	9488691	I remember that.
9488711	9489311	Okay, that's it.
9489451	9490211	I'm curious.
9491351	9493872	Questions for the two of us, please.
9496511	9497211	Oh, I'm sorry, what?
9497611	9497951	I don't know.
9498252	9498712	Next question.
9498892	9502213	I'm curious about what they would like to ask us.
9502253	9503233	Well, here we go.
9503293	9503833	I'm moving on.
9503873	9504794	I'm moving on with more questions.
9505034	9505234	Cool.
9505534	9509095	EOSFVB, do you carry a pen with you everywhere?
9509875	9510935	No, I don't.
9511736	9511996	I do.
9512796	9513316	I don't need to.
9513356	9514596	I always borrow my pen from Jamie.
9515657	9517077	My pen is also a glow stick.
9517677	9518038	Oh, dear.
9519918	9521238	I carry the penis mightier.
9522839	9524239	Because the penis mightier.
9527048	9528409	Do you carry a pot lid too?
9532031	9539816	I carry a fan I like to be the first on the show to say that I outright boycott any more Battle Royale references in the show
9542063	9545384	If you have any questions about Battle Royale, ask the dictionaries.
9545404	9545784	Jamie and I.
9563451	9566193	VidPowa, second question from VidPowa.
9566313	9567654	I'm so confused.
9568115	9571738	What exactly is this Bomani Battle Royale that you keep talking about?
9572919	9574160	Battle Royale is a movie.
9575000	9579404	Go to BattleRoyaleOnline.com and it's the best movie ever.
9579864	9585789	And imagine a bunch of us just flipping around the living room throwing paper plates at each other, stabbing each other with candles in the eye.
9587469	9589830	I can break this down very easily.
9590490	9593612	What happens when a bunch of six-year-olds watch the Power Rangers?
9593672	9594492	What happens after that?
9594752	9603256	They all pretend that they are Power Rangers and they pretend, you know, I'm the red one, I'm the pink one and they beat each other up, you know, pretend and then they pretend that they're transforming and stuff like that.
9604696	9605377	Shut up, Dave.
9605677	9607337	Anyway, that's what happened.
9607378	9616101	We watched Battle Royale, and then suddenly a bunch of six-year-olds were running around my living room playing Battle Royale, cutting each other with paper plates, strangling each other with tape.
9616521	9617262	It was beautiful.
9618282	9619663	And that was the Bomani Battle Royale.
9619723	9624245	And that's when I got knee-dropped into Rob's coffee table by zero.
9626218	9631100	Nothing will, uh... Actually, I pushed her and she just kind of fell, but... I didn't knee drop her, she knee dropped herself.
9631680	9635902	I think the greatest fuck up all day was Loki doing a caution drop on Max, too.
9638413	9651444	For one, that wasn't a caution drop, and number two, I had actually put the freeze there for that purpose, but the problem is, is pulling the freeze on the back of your hands when you do, like, a drop like that, you can't hold it down because there's not enough weight.
9651825	9655708	You can't get your, like, torso up high enough so that all your weight's on your hands.
9656989	9658010	I should have done knee drop!
9659551	9661033	But yeah, I couldn't get back up because I'm fat.
9662370	9666773	I want to see someone hold two freeze arrows on the diagonals with each of their ass cheeks.
9667754	9670676	Just have like one on the left and one on the right and be able to hold it.
9672397	9675079	As Rob looks at me and his eyebrow twitches.
9678522	9680463	Alright, let's move on.
9683785	9689229	Uh, SnubDistinoid says, Does anyone in the studio have a Game Boy Advance SP?
9689389	9691571	I got one and safe to say it rocks my cocks.
9692173	9693534	First of all, those things hurt my hand.
9694094	9698376	And I have an afterburner in my GBA, so I own you.
9698496	9699776	I want an afterburner in my GBA.
9699816	9701877	I don't need a Game Boy SP if I get an afterburner.
9703337	9704098	Does anybody have one?
9704798	9704978	No.
9708940	9709400	Question.
9709640	9710660	He has more than one?
9713802	9716143	I read it wrong, but cock doesn't rhyme with rocks.
9717583	9718544	So I had to say cocks.
9718604	9719344	It's just natural.
9721118	9726381	Okay, uh, one of our chatroom frequenters, if you ever run into him, his name is BigRedPimp.
9727942	9732324	Um, he does have an SP, so if you want, like, you know, info on it, just ask him.
9732664	9733105	No, see?
9733785	9734725	See, wait, wait, hold on.
9734745	9736526	Let me just say, court, hold on.
9736546	9738868	There's a person in here whose fiancé works for GameStop, hello.
9740330	9740790	No, okay.
9741091	9742351	My bad, Jamie.
9742371	9743272	God, let me talk.
9743292	9743732	My bad, Jamie.
9744193	9745974	No, um, hold on.
9746054	9746514	Let me speak.
9746534	9746694	Zero.
9746714	9747955	Go ahead.
9748415	9753959	And let me just say that Corey probably bought one, and he probably got two others just from getting them.
9754740	9758842	Okay, the SP is, like, the worst idea ever.
9758902	9764026	I mean, it's cool that it's compact, but it does hurt your hands, and if you have big hands, that's just gonna hurt you, too.
9764987	9770010	And it just looks kinda cool, but stupid at the same time.
9770663	9775847	The shoulder buttons are in the most retarded... I know, they're like in the crease of the screen.
9775867	9776567	That sucks.
9776688	9777928	That's going on my video game review.
9778389	9779289	Oh yeah, check it out.
9779309	9780771	I know how small the GBA is.
9781791	9782492	The GBA SP.
9782532	9785414	But it looks like you can play with one hand.
9785714	9788716	I've tried playing with one hand on the GBA SP.
9788796	9789897	It's like squeezing a boob.
9790017	9791298	You look like you're squeezing a boob.
9795161	9796202	Or rocking your own cocks.
9796482	9797963	Hey, I'm good at it.
9804727	9810933	The only game that does not work on SP is Kirby's Tilt and Tumble, because you have to rock the Game Boy.
9810953	9818601	And of course, it's like up equals down, left equals right if you play the game.
9818621	9822425	You know, because you know how you put the cartridge in.
9823686	9823946	Indeed.
9826088	9827370	Just do yourself a favor.
9828405	9830826	Get a used GBA and get an afterburner.
9830846	9838709	Dude, these people that are buying these SPs are the same people that bought the Game Boy, then the Game Boy Pocket, then the Game Boy Color, then the Game Boy Advance, and now the SP.
9839129	9842310	You stupid bastards, do you realize they just milked five systems out of you?
9842651	9844431	Ha ha, I laugh at you, ass.
9844871	9848773	I've only bought the Game Boy, and now I'm going to buy the SP.
9850214	9853135	SP customers are the ones who bought Virtual Boys and enjoyed them.
9853215	9856176	Hey, I bought a Virtual Boy and enjoyed it, and I don't have an SP.
9857333	9862555	We got a Virtual Boy when Hollywood was clearing them out, so we had the nice plastic case, but that makes me headache.
9862936	9871119	But no, actually, to be perfectly honest, when the Game Boy Pocket came out, it was a massive improvement over the regular Game Boy because it was clearer.
9871820	9875661	But I love my Game Boy Color, and I still use it for one thing, DDRGB2.
9878675	9884277	No, the ones you bought SPs are probably the same ones you bought gamecoms.
9884437	9884817	Anyway.
9885137	9889158	Okay, I got a gamecom for five bucks when Toys R Us was clearing the map.
9889178	9889618	Moving on.
9892419	9894620	I own 42 video game systems, so... Okay.
9894640	9894900	Justin...
9900623	9903305	Justin Circuit is asking us a bunch of questions here.
9903686	9904326	Okay, here we go.
9904607	9906728	So we're just going to get a show of hands, okay?
9909131	9909691	Okay, here we go.
9909771	9912373	He's asking us a variety of questions here, so let's get a show of hands.
9912714	9915276	Justin Circuit would like to know, how many people like Jenny Rom?
9919260	9919920	Four and a half.
9920260	9921121	Okay, four and a half.
9921502	9922863	How many people like Judy Crystal?
9924841	9925281	Zero.
9926402	9926502	One.
9927383	9927903	A pinky.
9933506	9934767	Judy Crystal got a pinky.
9935308	9936608	How many people like Propel?
9941531	9943993	One, two, three, four, five, six.
9944393	9945534	Wait, one, two, three.
9945614	9946855	I actually counted two hands.
9947255	9949576	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
9950097	9950657	All but two.
9951017	9952278	Okay.
9953086	9955366	How many people like Ramune?
9955426	9955907	Ramune.
9957787	9958087	Four.
9958467	9958787	Five.
9961208	9962888	I brought back 15 Ramune balls.
9963468	9965148	I thought it was ramen.
9965908	9966729	I said balls.
9966769	9967729	Help me, Rob.
9969309	9970089	I wasn't trying to.
9970129	9970529	Sorry.
9971650	9971990	Okay.
9972950	9974830	A special question for Angel.
9977311	9978451	This comes from Shadow.
9980612	9981573	Shadow, I hate you!
9981633	9982993	No, no, no, okay, ask the question.
9983053	9985275	Do you mind if Jen and I come visit for a while?
9986575	9987956	Why'd you have to ask that on air?
9987976	9990678	Can we just deal with that somewhere else, please?
9993139	9996781	And what kinds of things will be on the agenda?
9998142	9999042	No comment!
9999303	9999583	Okay.
10001218	10003400	I am now going to end the fucking music.
10003480	10005982	Oh, I missed, JB, Justin, I missed your last line.
10006022	10007364	Whatever the last thing is you sent.
10007544	10008364	You asked another question.
10008384	10009105	I accidentally exit it out.
10009125	10009766	I need to resend it.
10009806	10010947	Okay.
10012468	10015471	Since we're out of questions, does anybody in the room have a question for somebody else?
10015711	10015951	Yes.
10016552	10016812	Yes, Dave.
10016832	10019354	I have a question for Rob.
10019895	10020215	Great.
10020235	10021396	Have you ever AAA'd a heavy song?
10021756	10023017	Have I ever AAA'd a heavy song?
10023637	10027499	Just this week, I AAA'd La Copa De Vida, which is my first AAA heavy.
10028160	10028880	Awesome.
10028900	10031501	On Extreme, I should say, because I did a few on 4th Mix back then.
10031541	10031842	Oh, really?
10032302	10032762	Oh, that's cool.
10033402	10037064	I have, on the 4th Mix, Superstar.
10037364	10037645	Awesome.
10039205	10041447	That was like when I played Superstar every game I ever played.
10041467	10042907	I remember that.
10042947	10044288	But I have a question.
10044388	10046489	Charim, which of us do you think would win a Battle Royale?
10047530	10047950	Dave.
10047970	10048931	Dave.
10048971	10049331	Dave.
10050054	10050454	Okay, wait.
10050534	10050755	Okay.
10050835	10053036	I actually have... Okay.
10053276	10056758	I actually got a bunch of questions just now, so I'm going to go through those.
10057139	10057419	Anita?
10060261	10061702	Oh, yeah.
10061742	10062822	Okay, hold on.
10062882	10064723	Let's let Anita ask her question while I check email.
10065124	10066104	It's not so much a question.
10066405	10068186	I have an accomplishment I want to announce.
10068866	10072729	I passed my first 2DX song with a full combo.
10072849	10074029	Yay!
10074630	10076851	It was... It was a beauty of silence.
10077151	10077532	No, wait.
10077872	10079093	I forget what song it was.
10079213	10079373	It was...
10080758	10084981	No, it was Beauty of Silence or... I think it was... I can't remember.
10086483	10087884	But it was a full combo.
10087904	10088885	Yay, I have one too.
10089726	10092468	I passed three other 2DX songs today.
10092908	10094550	Yay, gotta start somewhere.
10094730	10095591	Full combo too.
10096872	10100815	Chat room says, Dave, because he's insane, just look at him for the Battle Royale.
10101016	10101836	I think I'd kick his ass.
10105071	10110055	Shadow would like to clarify, Shadow would like to clarify, I haven't a clue, but you're not around.
10112904	10118745	Alright, Snub would like to say, on sakbamani.com, who is deleted member and what happened?
10119165	10120286	Oh god, you had to bring this up.
10120366	10124046	Okay, our hosts suck a big ball of shit.
10124507	10131248	What happened is that some of our files started getting either deleted or zeroed out, which means all the content in them was deleted.
10131588	10136109	So threads are gone, members are gone, there's no rational explanation for it.
10136169	10139590	It's just, there are servers deciding to fuck with our files.
10139930	10140150	What?
10141031	10144555	You know, I thought it was a quota thing, but it's not because it's still letting me upload new files.
10144896	10151764	It's the wild monkey they have controlling the server there.
10153085	10155087	Don't ever use $1hosting.com.
10155128	10156589	They suck big balls.
10156609	10157710	But the press said yes!
10160053	10160554	Moving on.
10161724	10163065	We're working on a backup plan.
10163085	10164245	No, Jason's not here, unfortunately.
10164606	10168008	In the meantime... We're working on a backup plan as we speak.
10168248	10169348	I'm going to make forums.
10169689	10170969	I don't know how, but I will.
10171169	10171450	Okay.
10172190	10173971	Another show of hands for Justin, please.
10174071	10174851	Another show of hands.
10174911	10175292	Here we go.
10175892	10177733	How many people like Cup of Child?
10178173	10179374	Cup of Child, anybody?
10179794	10180134	Three?
10180595	10180895	Four.
10181035	10181515	Okay, four.
10181615	10181875	Okay.
10183616	10184437	And for the... Okay.
10187859	10188079	Okay.
10190982	10191902	Last question, gang.
10191942	10192522	Last question.
10192702	10193343	This is a good one.
10193363	10194663	We can go around the room and ask everyone this.
10194683	10195763	This one comes from VidPower.
10196963	10203485	And VidPower would like to know from everybody, and everybody's experienced enough with this game now, what is your favorite 2DX video?
10204725	10205325	Let's go around.
10205345	10205806	Let's go around.
10206066	10207266	Starting with Jamie, or do you want to go last?
10207486	10207726	Jamie.
10208546	10209026	Jamie's last.
10209066	10209426	Magus.
10211247	10211687	What else?
10212107	10212567	Stoic.
10218889	10219949	I was going to say the same thing.
10219989	10220329	Stoic.
10223366	10236208	Okay, um, WowWow70 is because where else does, like, Broccoli have an afro along with Skyscrapers and all this other cool stuff that sends out afro raids and AAAs the world with afros.
10236909	10237529	It's just cool.
10238389	10239349	Go afro.
10244630	10249091	Um, I'll have to say, I like Bad Routine, that's pretty good.
10250939	10254522	Yeah, better team than the guy dancing, or dancers pretty good.
10255202	10259725	But, if you want to go with eye candy, you can't beat Last Message, because there's giant breasts.
10259745	10260226	Oh, yeah.
10261587	10263008	Rob licked boobs today.
10263028	10271554	No, um, okay, I would probably say my favorite one is, and people will laugh at me about this, but, um, the Calcutta video.
10272174	10279760	Because Dr. Bombay is my hero, and he owns you, and second best is SOS, but if you get SOS, you have to get the full video on Kazaa.
10283190	10290452	This is probably really generic and everybody's favorite, but I'd have to say Alien World because it's got the cool little alien puppet doll thing.
10290952	10293672	Alien World gave me nightmares the first time I saw it.
10293692	10296373	I had a dream of weird alien people coming to kill me.
10296873	10297193	I'm done.
10297593	10301854	Alright, Angel made a decision, finally.
10301994	10304935	I chose V because, well, yeah, it turns into that one too.
10305255	10306775	I can't believe I didn't think about this.
10307315	10311056	The best one has to be, one of the best ones has to be Gradius Cyber.
10314745	10320449	I have a couple.
10321089	10324211	One of them is definitely Sweet Lab, because it's so cute.
10324872	10331396	But my overall favorite one, actually I really like Burning Heat, because it's also Gradius 2, which is one of my favorite shooter games ever.
10332197	10332937	I say Cheer Train.
10333778	10337481	I love the little thingies walking around with the little sign that says, WIN!
10338161	10338581	The peeps!
10338701	10339342	Why am I outnumbered?
10341784	10342424	Jelly Kiss.
10343485	10343905	Whatever.
10344706	10347588	My favorite... I have a serious favorite and a fun favorite.
10347688	10349209	Well, I have a couple serious favorites.
10349489	10352391	Okay, my favorite video is Reincarnation.
10352651	10352891	Yes.
10353351	10354052	Good, good, good.
10355534	10356014	Dancer.
10356354	10356914	Good, good, good.
10357154	10365196	And then my favorite 2DX video of all time, and a lot of people forget about this one, but it honestly is the most kick-ass 2DX video they ever did, because they cut it after a couple styles were just sad.
10365556	10366056	Sometime.
10366956	10367376	Never saw it.
10367436	10368516	Sometime is the best 2DX video.
10368536	10369557	No, Root80s.
10369957	10371877	Root80s is like the best one ever.
10373777	10374078	Alright.
10374098	10375758	No, the best one is Nothing Ain't Stoppin' Us.
10376138	10377098	Funky Bingo Paradise.
10377238	10379459	Because you can't beat the Boogie Dancers.
10380299	10381759	The freakin' Funky Bingo Paradise.
10382779	10385900	Wait, wait, wait, I gotta add another one just because it's all about us.
10386480	10388660	It's all about Love is Orange.
10389080	10389620	Love is Orange.
10389700	10390661	Oh, come on.
10390861	10393601	I know, it's a good one, it's a good one.
10393661	10393921	Alright.
10393981	10398942	Alright, so now you've gotten like every decent 2DX video has just been named.
10400082	10403083	Alright, we need to... Hey, guess what, kids?
10403583	10404203	Guess what, kids?
10404223	10404843	Hey, it's that time.
10404883	10405603	Guess what, kids?
10406043	10406824	I'm a broken record.
10407064	10407804	I'm a broken record.
10407984	10408184	Okay.
10409904	10411605	It's time for the final thoughts.
10411805	10415026	The show is over, and I've got to get the fuck out of here, right?
10415126	10418207	It's 9.30, so let's go around and get final thoughts.
10419548	10420728	You want to go around the room again?
10420808	10421388	Start with Magus?
10422649	10423529	Alright, start with Magus.
10424089	10424789	Final thought, please.
10427930	10428211	Angel?
10428291	10429611	Alright, Dave?
10429711	10430391	Xenon sucks.
10430431	10430992	I'm not a tool.
10439208	10446502	and I will hopefully be able to go to V3 and do awesome in Power Station.
10448357	10451038	Um, since I didn't get to do a sim update, thanks.
10451598	10452098	Oh, sorry.
10452598	10453518	Oh, hurry up, make it quick.
10453638	10453938	Okay.
10454358	10457539	Uh, new CBS update for Step Maniacs that came out on the 27th.
10457559	10458299	That's pretty good.
10458899	10460380	Um, then there's also my site.
10460460	10467161	Since my site right now is up and has all the DDRX stream and everything, pretty much every single official sim file out there, I have.
10467721	10471462	And DDRUK is down right now, and same with MamaniCell is down.
10471522	10473662	So, um, my server's the only place you can get them.
10473882	10475643	Too bad I haven't updated my pages to tell you how to get it.
10476543	10477725	Anyway, so there's that.
10477765	10481290	Check out Bomani Sims because there's tons of Sims on there that people make.
10481330	10482011	A lot of them suck.
10482652	10484034	A lot of them suck.
10484234	10485997	And then let's see what else.
10486758	10487699	And that's it.
10487879	10489422	And yeah, I'm done.
10489582	10490804	I'm going to finish my set tonight.
10492729	10496410	Um, basically, mine is, yeah, stop making Max remixes.
10496590	10498310	I'm sick and tired of fucking hearing them.
10498550	10499250	And they are all shitty.
10499270	10499730	Except for Loki's.
10500050	10502331	Except for Loki's and, um, Resurrection.
10503371	10506571	Um, and, um, let's see what else.
10506611	10510632	Oh yeah, also, I may suck at freestyling, but how far did the judges get in PA?
10511972	10513873	And, um, yeah, basically that's it.
10513953	10520274	Also, next week, I will have a video game review prepared with the help of Dark Child, who will also be helping me out with that.
10520754	10521034	I'm done.
10524697	10527238	This is the girl that has no voice.
10531061	10531982	Oh, I barely have a voice.
10533222	10535964	I don't know what to say except Ramun is the best drink in the world.
10536004	10536545	That's about it.
10536865	10537445	Yay!
10537785	10538466	Everybody have fun.
10538506	10539747	Hi to all my friends out there.
10540087	10542969	Everybody who knows... What?
10544610	10545731	I guess I have no friends.
10545951	10549813	Okay, I'm done.
10550894	10552275	Random quote, random quote.
10553286	10558149	I'll be making a DWF file that's going to be in the next tournament whenever it comes out.
10583735	10584055	Oh well.
10585736	10599904	And DDR Freak needs to stop having those bug viruses that... Because you know the... Because you know the Sacramento Marshmallow is a threat?
10599924	10600924	Sometimes his pages are off.
10603203	10608085	And I know I'm two hours late, but F you to really bad April Fool's pranks.
10608125	10612848	There's a lot of people that tried stupid pranks, and you can see right through them, and we call them on it, and we ruin their fun.
10613468	10617170	Okay, I don't know how so many people fell for mine.
10619391	10623012	I said I was moving to Seattle.
10623072	10624993	There's some things you don't joke about.
10625594	10627895	Because there's some things you just don't joke about.
10629836	10630476	That's not right.
10632265	10635847	I've never had ableful jokes that I was able to pull off.
10636488	10643692	My final thought is... Why don't you give me a sign?
10645153	10645553	Never mind.
10645973	10646193	Angel?
10646213	10647874	I didn't have my final thought.
10647894	10648235	Jamie?
10649335	10654358	My final thought is... I want ice cream.
10654598	10656099	The system.
10656660	10657200	The system.
10658846	10662128	Sack Me Monty Rules and I want to do this again and again and again.
10662168	10662588	I'll shut up.
10663869	10667031	No, seriously, I want ice cream.
10667051	10669072	For my birthday, give me the Battle Royale novel.
10669873	10670193	April 19th.
