1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Message for you, son!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Attention!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The Monty Talk and then some.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Orange Lounge may contain adult cunt.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex in this episode.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hey, are there any balls down there?

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That's the biggest player you've ever seen, Jingle Berry.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What's your favorite scary movie?

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Showgirls. Absolutely frightening. What's yours?

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's less a time on sprockets than we does.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I know cunt food.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Why did they have to take the word gay?

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh, what I expect for funny sex with a cunt is handsome.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hey!

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Dark Saffron.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Shut up! Where's my gun? This is my boom stick.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Skye.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Come on, girls, it's time to drop the bomb.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex with me.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What kind and what human being would find that funny?

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We are live, but not really.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And this is episode number 42 for April the 27th of 2003.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You're tuned into the Bomani Scene's most premeditated radio station of all things Beeeemani.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Skye.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You know her better as Dark Sakura.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Or tonight, as her name tag says, Miss Pac-Man.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I like your shirt. That's a cool shirt.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's retro.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Loki is out today because he's doing stuff.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
He broke his track record again.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
No, it's amazing. I don't know what he's doing tonight. He's just doing stuff.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yeah, he's fapping.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
He's pecking and fapping.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Actually, we have a secret.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We're not really live tonight.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
No, we're really dead.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Unless it's Thursday for you right now.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
If it is Thursday the 24th, then yes, we're live.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We're premature this week.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We came a little early this week to your sound waves.

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's going to be an interesting show tonight because there's really not a lot tonight.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's just Jamie and me.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We might have one special guest who's around here somewhere.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We're just going to talk about stuff.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Jamie and I are both kind of in moods where we just don't give a fuck.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
My socks are stripy.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I like your socks. They're pretty.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I can't say that I don't like your socks at all.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll get you my pretty.

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Does he know?

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah, so let's take a quick break.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We're going to start off with some old school five key songs.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
This is our chat room. CaliPomani.com. Click on Orange Lounge, click on chat.

Oh

77
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,000
Mr.. Random person on the street who by the way is not an actor

78
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,240
What do you think of the orange don't play money music and more show the music is like being transported to?

79
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,240
just this

80
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,840
dancing spaceship place it's

81
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,600
Unearthly it's like being in a club except. You don't have to you know I should ask someone to dance

82
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,480
Hey, you're listening to orange lounge radio episode number

83
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,560
42 and tonight, we're being a little bit sneaky. We're actually pre-taped tonight, so

84
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,000
But that doesn't mean there isn't a party going on or not around mommy and daddy aren't home in the chat room

85
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,960
So I'm sure there's plenty of people causing a commotion so go on in there and party with them. They're over at

Click here for goat say

90
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:36,280
Yeah, that was that was another April Fool's joke. I was like how can you do goat say radio?

91
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,880
Maybe maybe next year for April Fool's we can play just play gay porn over here

92
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:58,880
Oh my god, I finally did monkey sex an orange lounge

93
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:06,840
Oh finally whoo, I think whoo whoo, what was it?

94
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,640
Well Conan O'Brien has the masturbating bear

95
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:22,760
I think a video took these people at the zoo and the monkey was Lincoln. They show that on cable or something?

96
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,240
That's one of those skinnamax looks

97
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,400
Oh my god, I watched the blue girl live-action

98
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:52,480
Le blue girl live-action. God, it was horrible describe Le blue girl for the uninitiated. It was an anime it was really crappy but oh my god I never need to see that again it was like volume 3 or something oh so there's more than one. Yeah, it's like a story

99
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,560
Is acting in as bad as it was in the anime?

100
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:15,560
Actually there was some decent acting but other than that it was like oh, it's a garden hose. Oh, it's going in my mouth. It looked like they were like spitting up vegetable oil I neglected to introduce our special guest tonight. Hi to Brad, by the way.

101
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:34,560
Oh shit, I had something I was going to say. Did you try to make him eat that microphone? Yes. Suck it, suck it good. Oh I hit his teeth. Oh my bad. I'm going to wipe it off now, excuse me. That's a really good radio.

102
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:54,560
Today we're painting on Orange Lounge Radio. We're going to make a happy cloud. Fluffy white clouds of cocaine. I was so sad when Bob Ross died.

103
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:17,560
That's sad. What other people have died recently that made me go? Mr. Rogers. Oh, Nell Carter. She was cool. Shut up. I like Nell Carter.

104
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:35,560
I used to watch Give Me a Break. So yeah, interesting week for us. I think we've all just been very busy and doing like random sorts of things. It's been like a crazy week for me.

105
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:56,560
Your car passed smog? Yeah, doing 50. It's been really random. I've been working on pictures. I have a desk lamp. It clips onto my shelf. It makes things bright so I don't go blind when I draw.

106
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:14,560
It clips onto your shelf so it's a shelf lamp. Sort of. It's just a clip onto a desk but I don't have a desk that it'll fit on. It's multi-purpose. You can clip it anywhere. You can clip it on your nipple if you wanted to. No. I have these shelves that are over my computer desk where we keep our old school stuff.

107
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:31,560
Not a nipple clamp lamp. It's a tongue twister. Nipple clamp lamp. That's the new Erotic song, isn't it? Yes, the new Erotic single, nipple clamp lamp. Yeah, it's the bee side to temple of butt.

108
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:50,560
You know what's interesting is that Dark Tetsuya, who is an obsessive listener of this show, pointed out in the chat room a while back that actually in an earlier episode, and he cites episode 12, I apparently actually said something about Mr. Rogers is not dead.

109
00:12:50,560 --> 00:13:06,560
By the way, and I appreciate our listeners, but when you remember episode numbers, that's the time that you need to go on vacation.

110
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:24,560
Well, if I remember right though, episode 12 was the second episode we broadcast this week. Okay, but I haven't been keeping up with episode 12. I haven't either. Dear people, if you refer to a specific event, don't refer to it by episode number because we sure as fuck don't remember.

111
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:39,560
Do you remember episode three? No. Oh my God, I wasn't here. Yeah, you weren't here. I remember that because I remember when Orange Laundry started, you were here the first week. We had everybody here the first week, and then the second and third week, it was like, I'm going to Anime Expo. Bye.

112
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:55,560
That was it too. I was like, I'm in LA. Bye. I'm in San Diego. Bye. And then we were just kind of here without Jamie for a couple weeks. And then I went to Alabama. Bye. Oh, I'm stuck in traffic in San Francisco.

113
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:09,560
I thought Alabama happened before. We've been doing the show since June 23rd. Okay, then never mind. I was stuck in traffic in San Francisco one time. I remember that too.

114
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:25,560
And then Julie and I were like, fuck this, we're going back in. We went back and got all yucked on.

115
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:40,560
Not always. Huh? Who else would have a higher? Matt. Jamie or Matt. But, oh well. Not me. I couldn't show delinquent. It's all good. Verbal warning. Because I do stuff.

116
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:57,560
You know, I have taken the microphone out a bunch of the time when I've not been here. And sometimes, even when we're not having a show, I take the microphone off. I do fuck off all the time. So maybe I have the highest attendance after all because I attended my own home.

117
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:11,560
I work from home. You work from home? I see. Seriously. So, God, what else is new this week? It's such an interesting show tonight because there's just nothing to talk about.

118
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:27,560
You call that interesting? I know. Aren't you excited about tonight's show? Any listeners. I know how to get you excited. Go download some porn. It's funny. Let's just get drunk. That'll be funny. I'm just kidding. I know I have work. Actually, I have work tomorrow. I can get drunk. Sure.

119
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:34,560
Let's just pretend we're getting drunk. And then if the show's really bad because we're lagging, we can just say we were drunk. Sorry.

120
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:45,560
Jamie will get drunk and I'll get high and then you'll be sober. You can get drunk, you can get high and I'll have sex.

121
00:15:46,560 --> 00:16:01,560
I'll be in the other room. It sounds like the real world. No, because we need to have, we need a black person. We need either an Asian or a Pacific Islander.

122
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:14,560
We need to have, yeah, we need a person with bad hygiene. We need everybody to hate somebody else. We need the racist. And the racist has to be a roommate. We have Loki.

123
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:30,560
We have Loki. I don't know where Loki is tonight. He just said he wouldn't be available tonight. I think he's either fapping or he's probably getting ready for the moving on Saturday, which is one reason we're taped tonight.

124
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:44,560
He's having special time with that significant other. That's possible too. Who has time for relationships? I sure don't. Yeah, see there's like a special on the Matrix tonight.

125
00:16:44,560 --> 00:17:07,560
Well, there is a little bit of news. Actually, there's a lot of news. We're just being lazy. We're procrastinating for next week. Who said we'd bring you news timely? Come on. You know what I realized? We kind of lied last week. We said that last week was the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio from this studio, but we're actually in the studio tonight.

126
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:19,560
Tonight's the last episode in the studio, even though we're pre-taped. I'm confused. I just went cross-eyed. Yeah. I want ice cream. Let's go get ice cream. Fuck this show. Bye.

127
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:35,560
I had salad today. Did you? From where? The grocery store. Did you toss your salad? Yes, I did actually. It landed on the cat. You know what's funny? I had a salad today too, and I shook my salad.

128
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,560
Yeah.

129
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:54,560
All right. One interesting thing that's in Bamani News this week. DanceMania EX3 just came out, and I don't have a copy, and I want one. So somebody get me one. What the fuck's on this one this time? Get this. Ace of Base, first track. How cool is that?

130
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:09,560
Jamie's blinking. Okay, then again I did buy an Ace of Base CD, didn't I? This is great. Creamy has a song on DanceMania EX3 called Help I'm a Fish. Cool. I have to listen to that. Oh my God.

131
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:34,560
Track six is called Help I'm a Fish. New Smile Decay, new Captain Jack, new Bus Stop, new 2 Unlimited, new DJ Alligator, new Lasko, which is like no surprise if you've been following the EX series, a trance remix of Erotic Gimme Gimme Gimme, the 2003 mix, and then another Creamy song, a remix of I Do I Do I Do.

132
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:43,560
I'm looking forward to Help I'm a Fish. As soon as we get a copy of that, we'll play that for y'all. That would be fun.

133
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:54,560
And Bus Stop, it looks like this time around, is covering I Was Made for Lovin' You. You know, the only way I remember that song is through Moulin Rouge.

134
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:11,560
I've never seen Moulin Rouge. I know, you've never seen Moulin Rouge. We've got to make you watch that sometime. But there's this part where they, you know, they're going back and forth between all these love songs, and then there's that part where I was made for lovin' you, baby, you were made for lovin' you. I should never sing on this show.

135
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:26,560
Yes. Indeed. Quite.

136
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:41,560
I Was Made for Party on You. I Was Made for Stiff and Glue.

137
00:19:41,560 --> 00:20:01,560
This has nothing to do with Bomani, but a lot of you that follow Bomani also follow Konami, and Konami has another game series that's somewhat popular. It's known a little bit. It's Castlevania. And get this, the new Castlevania is coming out, and look at that, it's 3D.

138
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:11,560
Come on, Castlevania dungeon. Okay, wait a second, but the last time they tried to do a 3D Castlevania game, it sucked shit.

139
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:28,560
This is new. Yeah, it was up yesterday. Okay, you know what? But this is what it says at the bottom. It says the article says this game will be entirely in 3D, but is not intended to be like Castlevania 64, which the producer openly admitted to hating.

140
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,560
The game takes place in the 11th century, apparently, but other story details are pretty vague.

141
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:38,560
God damn it, they need to do another one with Richter. Everybody pray to whatever god you believe in that this game does not suck, please.

142
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:48,560
They need another game with Richter. Or as Maria said in the English version, Richter.

143
00:20:48,560 --> 00:21:11,560
What's that? Freaking Gradius 5. What's that about? It's new. I think it's soon. Gradius 5 on PS2. On the piece of shit too. Sorry.

144
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:24,560
Just because they took parts out of old space shuttles and stuff to make this thing doesn't mean it's like a system.

145
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:34,560
I just think people can't program for it for shit or else we would definitely have games that looked better.

146
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:46,560
Metal Gear Solid 2 was nice, but it was better on Xbox, I have to say. Because there was more room for anti-aliasing.

147
00:21:46,560 --> 00:22:10,560
That's why I like the new substance on PC. It's just as good as your system is. If you've got the best card in the world, it'll look better than anything you've got.

148
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:18,560
Rob, what do you have to say? Rob is off, you know, scratching his head. I don't know. I have nothing really to say on Castlevania.

149
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:33,560
You know what's interesting? I don't own a Playstation 2 American, and I'm not really going to be importing any games outside of Bumani games, and games that are really really easy for me to understand, because A, it's too fucking expensive, and B, I don't have time to learn Japanese.

150
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:39,560
I have really no interest in getting a US PS2, so I really have no interest in US PS2 games.

151
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:46,560
I'm going to be getting Final Fantasy XM2, hopefully next month. I've already seen the ending.

152
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,560
No spoilers. You can just get a mod chip.

153
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,560
No.

154
00:22:52,560 --> 00:23:05,560
Because any other game that's going to come out after that is not going to work.

155
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,560
So how about if you mod your system now and then Seventh Style comes out and it won't work with your system?

156
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:23,560
Then I'll go buy Seventh Style. I mean, Seventh Style will work as a purchased version. I don't need to take pictures of it to play it. And Seventh Style won't come out. What? What, Rob? What?

157
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:36,560
Well, I've heard that before about, you know, that you get the mod chip, and then Sony could release a game that would basically fuck up your mod chip, or, you know, they override the computation, kind of like they did with the early chips.

158
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:45,560
Right to the end of the PlayStation's life. Right. And what's interesting about that is what they could do with it is they could do it through online purposes.

159
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:53,560
It's possible, you know, if your PS2 is online, you go online with Final Fantasy XI, and then sneak-sneak, it's updating your BIOS.

160
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,560
That's why I just will play on the computer, because it's coming out for computer in America.

161
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:11,560
By the way, if anyone is interested in that, if you go to squareenixusa.com, you can submit an application to beta test Final Fantasy XI for PC or for PS2.

162
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,560
I really hope they choose me.

163
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,560
Please, please, Square, I've played your game since the beginning.

164
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:23,560
I'm more than positive I'm going to get selected because I've done game beta testing before.

165
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,560
I played Ragnarok online, ew.

166
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,560
Yeah, that sucks they didn't continue that over here, because I really want to play Ragnarok.

167
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,560
There's still one beta testing right now.

168
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,560
The paid release is going to be out, I think, for the next couple months.

169
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,560
And they are going to America with it? Because it sounded like they were neglecting America.

170
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,560
They have an American beta test open right now.

171
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,560
Well, I mean, it's a closed beta, but they have it going on right now.

172
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:55,560
I know it's been talked about on here, but for those who don't know, RagnarokOnline.com, I don't know how it's spelled, R-A-G-N-O-R.

173
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,560
R-A-G-N-A-R, okay.

174
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:06,560
Okay. It's a really cool game. It's like Secret of Mana and online or something. Is that what you'd say?

175
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,560
Yeah. It's 3D environment, 2D characters.

176
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:19,560
That's actually what I was thinking, is that every time I see Ragnarok Online, I go, God, I really want to play a Secret of Mana online. Seriously.

177
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,560
It's about the closest you can get.

178
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,560
It's like Secret of Mana with Final Fantasy Tactics-

179
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,560
And you can beat up ants and grasshoppers that play the fiddle.

180
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,560
Fucking fiddle playing grasshoppers.

181
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:38,560
I don't know if you've seen it, but PopCap.com, they're the folks that make Bejeweled and all those really addicting little web games that people play online.

182
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,560
Oh, it's pretty addicting. Atomica, you probably haven't played any of those games, huh?

183
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:53,560
Well, PopCap's the company that makes all those games. They have a new game on their site that's kind of like, you know, it's a multiplayer-ish type game, which is online world type thing.

184
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:59,560
Which, at first look, it kind of, you know, first instinct was, oh, it's like a 3D Ragnarok kind of thing.

185
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:06,560
But it still needs a lot of tweaking, but it's interesting. It's worth checking out at PopCap.com because it's free.

186
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,560
I think if you pay money, you get special things, but...

187
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,560
Hey, I'm still doing Neopets, okay?

188
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,560
I have not checked on my Neopets in two weeks. The damn thing's probably dead.

189
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,560
Give me all your money.

190
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,560
I don't want to give you my money.

191
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,560
If you love your pet, give me your money.

192
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:23,560
Why?

193
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,560
So that I can get up to 500,000 Neopets.

194
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,560
I think I have like 25,000.

195
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,560
That's actually about what I need.

196
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,560
Really? Mwahaha.

197
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,560
But seriously, I've been trying to get up to...

198
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,560
Is that like the last level of saving?

199
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,560
No. That's about free on it.

200
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,560
I'm trying to upgrade to my next bank account.

201
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,560
Okay, why don't we take ourselves a quickie little break. We're going to come back. We're going to talk about Max 2.

202
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,560
Max 2, Japan came out this week, and there's been some interesting early reaction.

203
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,560
We're sitting here on Thursday night, pre-taping Sunday show, and there's already been some early reactions.

204
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:05,560
Some folks in the States have picked it up and have some interesting things to say about it.

205
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,560
So we will take a quick break.

206
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,560
About the overwhelming lack of monkeys.

207
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,560
Yes, about the lack of monkey sex.

208
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,560
We're going to play some Anothers for the hell of it.

209
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,560
We're feeling saucy.

210
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,560
So let's start this off with Spica, Another.

211
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:30,560
We'll be back on Orange Lawns Radio.

212
