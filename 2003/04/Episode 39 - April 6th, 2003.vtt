00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
message for you sir attention! do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.000
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex. In this episode...

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Hey, are there any balls down there?

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
That's the biggest bear you've ever seen, Dingleberry.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
What's your favorite scary movie?

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
Showgirls. Absolute frightful. What's yours?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Now's the time our sprockets pay me dogs!

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
I'll get you, my pretty!

01:03.000 --> 01:04.500
And your little dog, too!

01:04.500 --> 01:06.000
I know kung fu.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.500
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

01:08.500 --> 01:11.000
Why did they have to take the word gay?

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
No! What I expect for Spanish acquisition is gentle.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Hey!

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Dark Sakura.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
Shut up! Where's my gun? This is my boomstick!

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Sky.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Come on, girls, it's time to drop the bomb!

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex with me.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
What kind of warped human being would find that funny?

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Me!

01:38.000 --> 01:44.000
We are live, and this is episode number 39 for April the 6th of 2003.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
You're tuned in to the Bomani Scene's most corrupted radio station of all things...

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
Beeeeeeeemani!

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
My name is Rob Roberts, if you might know me as Sky.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.080
As always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest buddy on the farm, Miss

01:58.080 --> 01:59.080
Jamie Summers.

01:59.080 --> 02:02.000
You know her better as Dark Sakura.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.360
I hate the buzz, you guys, I really hate it.

02:04.360 --> 02:07.080
There's nothing we can do right now, sorry.

02:07.080 --> 02:11.600
In this corner, say hello to our Tech Masa Logie.

02:11.600 --> 02:14.440
I'm against the wall, so technically it's not the corner.

02:14.440 --> 02:18.960
I'm in mid-wall, exactly in the center.

02:18.960 --> 02:21.280
Also with us tonight, we have a lot of fucking people in the house.

02:21.280 --> 02:34.640
Say hello to 23rd Megas, say hello to DDR Angel, say hello to Blackwab, say hello to

02:34.640 --> 02:49.800
Dave, say hello to Intern Zero, and say hello to Dark Tetsuya, oh I like Marin's answer

02:49.800 --> 02:58.120

02:58.120 --> 03:04.440
No more battle royale in my living room. Yeah, so we have a lot of people here tonight, and

03:04.440 --> 03:16.960

03:29.720 --> 03:35.320

03:35.320 --> 03:54.960
We can be anything that we wanna be It's not so hard like 1, 2, 3, deep in the

03:54.960 --> 03:57.960

03:57.960 --> 04:02.960
The vision so deep that the eye can't see If you don't know now, then let it be

We're in the groove

In the garden of love

04:58.960 --> 05:03.960
Don't go with me, just go with me

05:03.960 --> 05:05.960
It's been known to me

05:05.960 --> 05:09.960
In the time of love

05:35.960 --> 05:39.960
oh

05:39.960 --> 05:43.960
so

05:43.960 --> 05:47.960
oh

05:47.960 --> 05:51.960

05:51.960 --> 05:55.960
oh

05:55.960 --> 05:59.960
oh

05:59.960 --> 06:03.960
oh

06:03.960 --> 06:29.660
Sweatin' Hubs, just waitin' out to sweat

06:29.660 --> 06:33.660
Sweating, huh? Just break it out. Sweat!

06:33.660 --> 06:40.440
Okay, challenging move!

06:40.440 --> 07:01.240
okay challenging move

07:01.240 --> 07:10.240
Baby don't you cry, I don't care if you're right or wrong

07:10.240 --> 07:17.240
The days we spent together, well it was not a waste of time

07:17.240 --> 07:24.240
Let me settle my mind through, so you're walking away from me

07:24.240 --> 07:30.240
I'll just close my eyes and, it's a pain that I get inside

07:30.240 --> 07:37.240
What is this fate? What is this fate? What is this fate in time?

07:37.240 --> 07:44.240
What is this fate? What is this fate? I thought that you were mine

07:44.240 --> 07:51.240
Well, it's time to say goodbye

07:51.240 --> 07:57.240
I can't even realize

07:57.240 --> 08:04.240
And I know you'll be the one in my whole life

08:04.240 --> 08:08.240
I'll never forget the way that you kiss

08:08.240 --> 08:15.240
The way that you smile forever

08:15.240 --> 08:18.240
Where did it come from?

08:18.240 --> 08:29.000
Oh, what is this space? What is this space? What is this space? What is this space?

08:39.360 --> 08:41.460
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

08:41.580 --> 08:44.120
Because Bongo demands it.

08:44.120 --> 08:50.400
Howdy ho everybody, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 39, featuring

08:50.400 --> 08:54.380
The Buzz, and we apologize about that.

08:54.380 --> 08:56.060
I don't know what the hell we can do about it.

08:56.060 --> 09:00.520
We've moved the computers, moved the subwoofers, tried to get everything magnetic away and

09:00.520 --> 09:01.520
it's not helping.

09:01.520 --> 09:02.520
Everyone die!

09:02.520 --> 09:09.040
Yeah, the sound card sucks, so you'll just have to deal with it until we move into the

09:09.040 --> 09:13.880
new studio for season number 3 and then we won't have The Buzz anymore, or we'll just

09:13.880 --> 09:21.840
have to do every show from Jamie's from now on. Buy me a new sound card. So, wow, what

09:21.840 --> 09:27.000
a week, huh? Yeah, it's been a while since we've been on the air. Well, not really, because

09:27.000 --> 09:30.880
if you guys were listening last week, you heard us live at Shaft. About this time was

09:30.880 --> 09:37.640
March Magic. Two years ago, you would have heard us live at Shaft. Oh, shit. With the

09:37.640 --> 09:43.840
entire audience in here, who's actually listening to this outside? That is an excellent question.

09:43.840 --> 09:47.680
the numbers in the studio are all-time high the numbers on the web all-time low

09:47.680 --> 09:50.040
no hello to all of you listening we appreciate it

09:50.040 --> 09:51.120
um...

09:51.120 --> 09:55.240
yeah live from Shaft, my bad

09:55.240 --> 10:02.080
I know I know, live from March Madness last week if you were

10:02.080 --> 10:04.880
listening

10:04.880 --> 10:07.720
about this time was when

10:07.720 --> 10:09.020
DDR

10:09.020 --> 10:11.600
the buzz went away for like half a second, it was amazing

10:11.600 --> 10:15.800
This is about the time that DDR Idol was finishing up.

10:15.800 --> 10:20.080
This is probably about the time that, oh, I don't know, maybe 23rd Magus was taking

10:20.080 --> 10:24.320
the stage right after Dr. Dick finished his routine.

10:24.320 --> 10:27.160
What are you shaking the microphones for?

10:27.160 --> 10:28.160
They saw him rock up all the time.

10:28.160 --> 10:31.600
Okay, well first off, you have two more mics, so why don't you try swapping one?

10:31.600 --> 10:32.600
It won't help.

10:32.600 --> 10:33.600
Trust me.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.240
Trust me, I've done everything to do this buzz.

10:36.240 --> 10:37.360
It's the noise of the hard drive.

10:37.360 --> 10:39.600
The power of Christ compels you!

10:39.600 --> 10:41.600
The power of Christ compels you!

10:41.600 --> 10:47.200
You just made it worse. It's the noise of the hard drive in there. Or something. It's

10:47.200 --> 10:55.080
fucked up. Anyway, so yeah, tournament. What'd you guys think? How did, uh, what'd you guys

10:55.080 --> 10:56.840
think of those of you that went to March Madness? How was it?

10:56.840 --> 10:58.840
A V.

11:00.840 --> 11:02.840
Nice toss, Rob.

11:03.840 --> 11:05.840
Um, B-

11:06.840 --> 11:10.840
Uh, B in My Paradise sucks. I hate it.

11:10.840 --> 11:11.840
Especially-

11:11.840 --> 11:14.840
But it's Mr. Wendell. He makes everything good.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.840
Yeah, but not for PA.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.840
Yeah, not for PA.

11:19.840 --> 11:20.840
Aw, you got owned.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.840
Shut up. I've never played this-

11:22.840 --> 11:23.840
You got owned.

11:23.840 --> 11:24.840
I've never played it before.

11:24.840 --> 11:25.840
But you got owned.

11:25.840 --> 11:27.840
Ode. Shut the fuck up, man!

11:27.840 --> 11:28.840
Ode.

11:28.840 --> 11:30.840
Please say something.

11:30.840 --> 11:31.840
Jeez, okay.

11:31.840 --> 11:34.840
Young London Cobble Doubles sucked.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.840
Okay, and...

11:37.840 --> 11:39.840
Xenon also sucked.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.840
Because it does, and it's really hard to PA.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.840
Fuck that.

11:43.840 --> 11:47.840
As for me, I came, I saw, I twitched.

11:48.840 --> 11:50.840
The left arrow in Sakura sucks.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.840
What the fuck is that, Celium and Mike?

11:52.840 --> 11:54.840
It's in my hand, you're just like, wank!

11:54.840 --> 11:56.840
What the fuck is that?

11:56.840 --> 12:00.840
You can't let me get a comment in before you have to say some shit?

12:00.840 --> 12:07.840
I didn't see shit. I didn't do shit but sit in that back room for both days while people flaked out on me.

12:07.840 --> 12:10.840
Now you know how it feels.

12:11.840 --> 12:13.840
Sorry.

12:13.840 --> 12:17.840
Jamie was well done by the time that was over. She was cooking in that room there.

12:17.840 --> 12:19.840
I hated people.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.840
But we love Jamie.

12:21.840 --> 12:25.680
We love Jamie for helping out, making everything run.

12:25.680 --> 12:29.680
I mean, you got visited by lots of people, and you got to eat bubbles with me.

12:29.680 --> 12:33.680
I didn't eat bubbles, I blew them.

12:33.680 --> 12:38.680
Haha, she said blue.

12:38.680 --> 12:39.680
Rob?

12:39.680 --> 12:40.680
Yes.

12:40.680 --> 12:41.680
Ow!

12:41.680 --> 12:42.680
Rob died again.

12:42.680 --> 12:46.960
You know, someone had to do the organizational stuff, and we're all grateful that Jamie did

12:46.960 --> 12:48.560
bother to sit back there.

12:48.560 --> 12:53.980
I would have done it myself but I was locked up in that goddamn glass box and trust me

12:53.980 --> 12:58.700
it sucks hard being able to see the tournament and not hear a damn thing, especially on DDR.

12:58.700 --> 13:00.860
I heard everything and didn't see a damn thing.

13:00.860 --> 13:08.020
By the way, by the way, hold out your arm, you're dead too.

13:08.020 --> 13:12.380
Jamie hit me with the tail of a furry thing.

13:12.380 --> 13:15.880
You know I would have loved to have helped Jamie out in the back room but I was too busy

13:15.880 --> 13:17.740
smoking and drinking behind everyone's backs.

13:17.740 --> 13:21.740
You'll have to forgive Jamie, she's been on a battle royale kick lately.

13:23.740 --> 13:24.740
We all have.

13:26.740 --> 13:27.740
And we played mocap golf.

13:30.740 --> 13:34.740
Only because it freaking rode over for like three holes and then you happened to get lucky and win one.

13:34.740 --> 13:36.740
Otherwise it would have kicked your ass.

13:36.740 --> 13:37.740
Oh shut up.

13:38.740 --> 13:40.740
Yeah, who won the long drive?

13:40.740 --> 13:42.740
Yeah that's right, I think I won the long drive.

13:42.740 --> 13:44.740
So watch this, shut the hell up.

13:44.740 --> 13:47.740
Drive for show, putt for dough, bitch.

13:47.740 --> 13:49.740
Whatever.

13:49.740 --> 13:53.740
Dude, I hit a 50-foot chip to make an eagle.

13:53.740 --> 13:54.740
So?

13:54.740 --> 13:55.740
Ooh, wow.

13:55.740 --> 13:56.740
It was cool.

13:56.740 --> 13:59.740
I've made chips for eagles and burritos before. It's easy.

13:59.740 --> 14:02.740
Yeah. Well, you know what? That was my first one, so you can shut your mouth.

14:02.740 --> 14:07.740
Hey, have you actually ever gotten par on that one that goes uphill?

14:07.740 --> 14:10.740
The one that goes, like, really, really steep uphill.

14:10.740 --> 14:12.740
Yes, I have gotten par on that twice.

14:12.740 --> 14:16.140
God damn, I got like a quadruple bogey on that shit.

14:16.140 --> 14:17.740
I have Propel!

14:17.740 --> 14:21.740
This is the reason why golf is on TV and no one watches it.

14:21.740 --> 14:24.740
Okay, welcome to Orange Lounge, mocap golf radio.

14:24.740 --> 14:26.740
Someone must watch it, they have the golf channel.

14:26.740 --> 14:28.740
I want mocap battle royale.

14:28.740 --> 14:30.740
I want mocap battle royale.

14:30.740 --> 14:31.740
Mocap napping.

14:31.740 --> 14:40.740
I want somebody, anyone who has programming skill, get like, you know, Quake or one of those things, what was it you were saying, Counter Strike?

14:40.740 --> 14:43.240
and make the battle royale counter strike

14:43.240 --> 14:47.480
oh wait let me just say that real quick some guy hit a 357 yard drive and got

14:47.480 --> 14:51.000
like a 63 to win some championship or something course record

14:51.000 --> 14:54.720
good but god still hates it 357 yards in one hole

14:54.720 --> 14:58.560
yeah in real life god hates golfers

14:58.560 --> 15:02.520
hey what does Dave look like he's obi-wan over here golf is paid for by

15:02.520 --> 15:05.000
morons who buy ugly pants use the force

15:05.000 --> 15:09.080
but anyways no that's why Plaid will never go out of fashion because of golfers

15:09.080 --> 15:21.080
I know you said that Counter Strike sucks for doing it, but for Battle Royale, Counter Strike is like the best thing to edit.

15:21.080 --> 15:23.080
I hit a vital organ.

15:23.080 --> 15:25.080
That's the easiest thing to do.

15:25.080 --> 15:34.080
And by the way, yes, why, thank you for asking. Yes, I did compete last week in freestyle, and I got all fails.

15:34.080 --> 15:37.080
How did that go, your very first freestyle?

15:37.080 --> 15:48.080
I had a nervous breakdown about five minutes before it was my turn because like I fell playing a challenge in front of everybody and then I like freaked out and then I got up and finally played.

15:48.080 --> 15:54.080
And I think I did alright for my first but it's old school and no one likes old school anymore. So fuck them.

15:54.080 --> 15:59.080
Don't start that again.

15:59.080 --> 16:06.080
Yes and for those of you in the chat room and listening who got to hear my lovely little rant remember it because you'll never hear it again.

16:06.080 --> 16:14.080
I want to know who those chicks were that were massaging my hair. I have no idea who those people were, and they're just coming up against me for DVDs.

16:14.080 --> 16:23.080
Okay, hold on, I've realized something. Don't steal a girl's glasses, because then she follows you around and annoys all your friends.

16:23.080 --> 16:29.080
She just had these cool glasses and I stole them, and then she decided that she would try to fuck everybody or something. I don't know what it was, she was doing it.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.580
So that's what I was doing wrong when I was singles.

16:31.580 --> 16:33.580
I didn't steal glasses.

16:33.580 --> 16:34.580
Mental notes!

16:34.580 --> 16:36.580
I didn't steal glasses.

16:36.580 --> 16:38.580
Yeah, you gotta steal the nerd glasses.

16:38.580 --> 16:41.580
So that's how I get the preteen booty.

16:41.580 --> 16:44.580
They were hoes anyway, you could tell.

16:44.580 --> 16:46.580
Yeah, yeah.

16:46.580 --> 16:48.580
Uh oh, looks like you hit a nerve.

16:51.580 --> 16:57.580
Like I was telling two friends after the first day of the tourney,

16:57.580 --> 16:59.580
What walks on two legs and spells slut?

16:59.580 --> 17:00.580
What?

17:00.580 --> 17:02.580
I'm not saying it on the air.

17:07.580 --> 17:09.580
This is quiet, so...

17:09.580 --> 17:13.580
Oh, what I need is a good defense.

17:13.580 --> 17:16.580
So anyways, yeah, it was Let the Beat Hit Em that I freestyled to.

17:17.580 --> 17:24.580
Watch the video. It's another white guy freestyling, or some white guy doing Let the Beat Hit Em. That's what the title is.

17:24.580 --> 17:26.580
Yeah, that's what you got titled as, some white guy.

17:26.580 --> 17:30.580
Some white guy. I am some white guy. That's great.

17:30.580 --> 17:32.580
Xerox.

17:32.580 --> 17:34.580
Well, he didn't even get my song.

17:34.580 --> 17:36.580
Okay, fuck that shit, alright?

17:36.580 --> 17:40.580
It's fucking clearly Zero Space X.

17:40.580 --> 17:43.580
I don't know where the fuck somebody gets Xerox.

17:43.580 --> 17:45.580
Okay, it doesn't even start with an X.

17:45.580 --> 17:48.580
I mean, fucking go to school.

17:48.580 --> 17:51.580
Fucking goat bite. Fucking morons.

17:51.580 --> 17:53.580
At least you got your name.

17:53.580 --> 17:57.080
You have to realize that when everybody sees that, and everybody says...

17:57.080 --> 17:58.580
Blah, blah, blah, fuck you!

17:58.580 --> 18:01.080
When everybody is saying...

18:01.080 --> 18:02.080
Does it matter?

18:02.080 --> 18:06.080
Zero X.

18:06.080 --> 18:08.080
Hooked on phonics works for me!

18:08.080 --> 18:09.080
Not for them!

18:09.080 --> 18:12.580
I've got yellow fever!

18:12.580 --> 18:14.080
There's a snake in my boot!

18:14.080 --> 18:18.080
You know what? They were reading it as one word because they thought it was Asian typing.

18:18.080 --> 18:19.580
Do me, do me, do me.

18:19.580 --> 18:24.580
Well hey, my first tournament at March Madness last year, I was elect-toddled or something.

18:24.580 --> 18:31.580
I looked at that paper, and it was clearly written 0x.

18:31.580 --> 18:34.580
I mean, if you were that big of a moron, I'm sorry.

18:34.580 --> 18:38.580
Well you just thought you were lead to Xerox with a Z.

18:38.580 --> 18:43.580
You know what, I don't give a fuck. You could go to school. Go buy a Xerox machine!

18:43.580 --> 18:46.580
I'm still ski.

18:46.580 --> 18:50.580
Okay, I guess that makes it a little better, but I'm still not fucking Xeroxed.

18:50.580 --> 18:53.580
At least you're not some white guy doing some song.

18:53.580 --> 18:59.580
I am some white guy, and I swear to God if another face goes in my hand, another hand goes in my face, I'm gonna punch somebody.

18:59.580 --> 19:01.580
I'm blind!

19:01.580 --> 19:04.580
What up, mah honkies?

19:04.580 --> 19:06.580
I am some white guy.

19:06.580 --> 19:10.580
You are some white guy, but I am the other white guy.

19:10.580 --> 19:12.580
Okay, Freestyler.

19:12.580 --> 19:13.580
Whatever, Intern.

19:13.580 --> 19:16.900
Ooh, intern, that's a thing.

19:16.900 --> 19:20.260
Well, at least he's part of staff.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.780
I die.

19:21.780 --> 19:23.620
I'm still curious to see who's actually here.

19:23.620 --> 19:26.500
Oh, with the P.

19:26.500 --> 19:28.780
Moving right along.

19:28.780 --> 19:32.740
Let's talk about why everyone's here right now.

19:32.740 --> 19:35.660
They're all here to see me.

19:35.660 --> 19:37.540
I think actually the celebrity of the weekend

19:37.540 --> 19:39.580
would be DDR Angel, who's back.

19:39.580 --> 19:41.420
OK, and then Jamie.

19:41.420 --> 19:44.420
So, Angel, you've been where for the past five weeks?

19:44.420 --> 19:49.420
I went to Japan for five weeks, and I missed all of you guys for five weeks, but that's okay.

19:49.420 --> 19:51.420
What part of Japan did you go to?

19:51.420 --> 19:59.420
I went to Kyushu Island, which is basically the southernmost, almost the southernmost part of Japan.

19:59.420 --> 20:02.420
Kyushu Island, Kagoshima City.

20:02.420 --> 20:04.420
So what kind of stuff did you get to see while you were there?

20:04.420 --> 20:05.420
You want to hear a story?

20:05.420 --> 20:06.420
Yeah, let's hear a story.

20:06.420 --> 20:07.420
A funny story?

20:07.420 --> 20:08.420
Yay!

20:08.420 --> 20:10.420
Well, I thought it was funny, but okay.

20:10.420 --> 20:12.420
This is the worst time. The buzz stops.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.420
I know. Just ignore the buzz.

20:14.420 --> 20:15.420
Shut up!

20:15.420 --> 20:17.420
Alright. Alright, so...

20:17.420 --> 20:21.420
I went shopping one day with my relatives and my mother and whatever.

20:21.420 --> 20:24.420
Okay, so I walk into the store.

20:24.420 --> 20:26.420
What do I hear right outside the door?

20:26.420 --> 20:28.420
DDR music.

20:28.420 --> 20:32.420
I run through the store frantically looking for a DDR machine going,

20:32.420 --> 20:34.420
I gotta play. I gotta play. I gotta play.

20:34.420 --> 20:37.420
I mean, I sounded like Loki, okay?

20:37.420 --> 20:39.420
Where's the machine? Where's the machine? Where's the machine?

20:41.420 --> 20:46.920
Did I find it? Did I find it? No, no, no, I didn't find it.

20:47.920 --> 20:51.920
I ended up noticing that it was coming from the freaking loudspeaker!

20:52.920 --> 20:59.920
So, I woke up to this lady that was working there, and I kindly asked her,

21:00.420 --> 21:04.920
Was it her CD? Just, you know, by the off chance that it might have been.

21:04.920 --> 21:06.920
And she said no, that it was the stores.

21:12.920 --> 21:13.920
So...

21:14.920 --> 21:15.920
No, no, no.

21:16.920 --> 21:18.920
See, cause then I said, can I buy it?

21:19.920 --> 21:22.920
And then she looked at me like a weird look, or with a weird look.

21:23.920 --> 21:26.920
And then she was probably saying in her head,

21:26.920 --> 21:28.920
she was stupid American.

21:29.920 --> 21:31.920
So, did you get to go to any arcades while you were down there?

21:31.920 --> 21:32.920
Yeah, I got to go to one.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.920
Is DDR dead?

21:34.920 --> 21:39.920
I got to play some Japanese people, and they thought I was cool, and they thought I was really good.

21:39.920 --> 21:41.920
And I kicked his ass.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.920
That's awesome. Did you actually play DDR?

21:43.920 --> 21:44.920
Yes I did.

21:44.920 --> 21:45.920
And there were actually other people playing DDR?

21:45.920 --> 21:46.920
Yes.

21:46.920 --> 21:47.920
I knew it was rumors.

21:47.920 --> 21:49.920
Yes, I played Popin' Music 9.

21:49.920 --> 21:50.920
How was Popin' Music?

21:50.920 --> 21:57.920
Popin' Music was okay, but unfortunately, sorry Joe, but can I do that?

21:57.920 --> 21:58.920
Sure, man.

21:58.920 --> 21:59.920
Dude.

21:59.920 --> 22:00.920
Anyways.

22:00.920 --> 22:12.920
We were playing Poppin' Music here last night because our new Bimani friend Garrett brought it over, and it has Boa Boa Lady Another on it. That, in itself, made my day.

22:12.920 --> 22:17.920
We'll get to, we'll get to, we're still going on the Japan trip, we'll catch up to present.

22:17.920 --> 22:18.920
Where was I?

22:18.920 --> 22:19.920
Poppin' Music 9.

22:19.920 --> 22:25.920
That's right, Poppin' Music 9. Now what was the rumor that was going around for Poppin' Music 9?

22:25.920 --> 22:26.920
Absolut.

22:26.920 --> 22:33.920
Yes, absolute. I played absolute. And what did I do? What did I do? I passed it!

22:33.920 --> 22:35.920
Yay!

22:35.920 --> 22:38.920
There is proof! Rob has proof!

22:40.920 --> 22:42.920
Tron was in it. Tron was in it.

22:49.920 --> 22:52.920
Well, Doctor 2 apparently thought it was a rumor, I don't know.

22:52.920 --> 22:56.920
Whatever, whatever. So we know it's really there and all that jazz.

22:58.920 --> 23:04.920
Speaking of which, I will be going to Japan in two weeks, or two weeks, so that will be cool.

23:04.920 --> 23:06.920
Dave gets it! Squeak!

23:06.920 --> 23:12.920
I'm going to Tokyo and Kyoto and Osaka, and I'm not going to Baidu Park.

23:12.920 --> 23:21.920
But what? Why? Because my brother is there right now, and we're going to see him because over the summer he will be in Tokyo doing something for work.

23:21.920 --> 23:27.160
for work or something like that and so he'll be doing something and so we're

23:27.160 --> 23:30.560
going to see him because it'll be like last time and I'm going to be in Tokyo

23:30.560 --> 23:35.040
for three days and then I think Osaka for like a week and Kyoto for a few days

23:35.040 --> 23:41.160
and I will go to an arcade and I will see if I'll yeah I'll go to the really

23:41.160 --> 23:45.320
big one in Tokyo and I'll be like wow there's no playing DVR it's in the corner

23:45.320 --> 23:59.320
My brother went to a fairly large arcade there and they had a whole Bomani corner and he took a picture of it. It was empty. There was no one playing.

23:59.320 --> 24:05.320
Hey Dave, do you really want to get drunk in Japan?

24:05.320 --> 24:08.320
I don't know.

24:08.320 --> 24:11.320
Because I know a really quick way.

24:11.320 --> 24:12.320
How?

24:12.320 --> 24:19.400
Go to a vending machine that has beer and like nobody's watching you still money in it and you can get beer and get drunk

24:22.760 --> 24:24.760
Japanese beer isn't that good?

24:25.120 --> 24:27.120
Yeah, but they have sake too

24:27.400 --> 24:30.520
Dun dun dun. I have a question for angel. No, I have a search for Rachel

24:30.520 --> 24:33.360
Did you were there any other like interesting games that you saw there?

24:33.360 --> 24:38.200
Like new games that a lot of people seem to be playing like maybe outside of Omani or any other kinds of games that seem to

24:38.200 --> 24:46.200
What kind of game was it, like a fighting game?

24:46.200 --> 24:53.200
It seemed like it was a racing game, so maybe it's another Initial D.

24:53.200 --> 24:58.200
Initial D is also ridiculously popular in the Asian sector.

24:58.200 --> 25:05.200
There were like five Initial D machines in this arcade I saw in Singapore, and in the freaking airport in Korea they had an Initial D machine.

25:05.200 --> 25:09.200
Which leads me to believe that, you know, and they had to pump it up and lose to Korea, so...

25:35.200 --> 25:39.200
My uncle and my aunt and everybody was looking at me and I was like, sorry?

25:39.200 --> 25:41.200
Okay, now I'm considered crazy great.

25:41.200 --> 25:43.200
Did you get to eat at America Town?

25:43.200 --> 25:47.200
For anybody that saw The Simpsons?

25:47.200 --> 25:49.200
What in the? Alright, whatever.

25:49.200 --> 25:55.200
Okay, there's an episode of The Simpsons where they go to Japan and Homer's, you know, where do they want to eat?

25:55.200 --> 26:01.200
Homer wants to go eat at America Town and Marge is like, we could eat American food back home.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.200
But he insists they go to America Town.

26:03.200 --> 26:11.200
And then the waiter is like, hi, I am stupid American waiter. Can I take your order? Would you like meat, food?

26:13.200 --> 26:25.200
When you go, I'll get you the address for the Taito arcade. You need to go there and take me pictures, because I want to go there to see the rose and rose upon bubble wobble machine.

26:25.200 --> 26:29.200
There's so many people I know going to Japan in the next week or two. It's crazy.

26:29.200 --> 26:33.640
No, seriously, my roommate's going to Japan for a year, Angel just came back to Japan,

26:33.640 --> 26:36.640
Dave's now going to Japan, one of my really good friends in Seattle is going to Japan.

26:36.640 --> 26:39.640
I've had so much shit coming back for me, it's not even funny.

26:39.640 --> 26:41.520
You have to bring me back a magazine, Dave.

26:41.520 --> 26:42.520
Dave.

26:42.520 --> 26:43.520
Bring me back a magazine.

26:43.520 --> 26:46.640
Dave, I have another quick request, I have another quick request.

26:46.640 --> 26:52.400
If I loaned you a remote kit, would you go and do interviews with people in the arcade?

26:52.400 --> 26:53.600
Would you just do random interviews?

26:53.600 --> 26:57.880
Dude, Baka Gaijin on the street would be the greatest segment ever.

26:57.880 --> 27:03.320
American in Japan. Come on, you gotta do it. Well, what would I interview them on?

27:03.320 --> 27:06.000
Ramani, you gotta go to the arcade. You're gonna go to an arcade while you're there,

27:06.000 --> 27:12.880
right? Yeah. Just say, hey, I'm from the American media. And say, there's this really big American

27:12.880 --> 27:18.520
show and I wanna talk to you about this game that's taking over America. And they'll probably

27:18.520 --> 27:26.720
go, huh? I just talked to random businessmen and like, Sarariman! I could try. I mean,

27:26.720 --> 27:30.660
I don't know Genki da and then go orange lounge radio. Yay

27:33.480 --> 27:39.160
Say you're from orange launch radio you you'll get laughed out of the country. Okay. All right sons bonsai. Oh

27:43.560 --> 27:45.560
My god state you asked you on the show. Oh

27:46.280 --> 27:48.000
Wait, wait, wait Rob

27:48.000 --> 27:50.080
Another random sighting. What's that?

27:50.440 --> 27:55.060
Synchronized love during a car commercial with like a bunch of horror girls and black and yeah

27:55.060 --> 27:57.060
Yeah, my friend had a cow.

27:57.060 --> 27:59.060
Did you happen to get to see any Para clubs?

27:59.060 --> 28:01.060
Or did you get to go to any Para clubs?

28:01.060 --> 28:03.060
Did you go to a store that sold big boots?

28:03.060 --> 28:05.060
No.

28:05.060 --> 28:07.060
Boring.

28:07.060 --> 28:09.060
Yeah, but I was at this...

28:09.060 --> 28:12.060
Remember, Para's a big thing in Tokyo and Osaka.

28:12.060 --> 28:14.060
And she wasn't there, so...

28:14.060 --> 28:16.060
True.

28:16.060 --> 28:18.060
True enough.

28:18.060 --> 28:20.060
Okay, so anything else you want to tell us about your trip?

28:20.060 --> 28:31.060
Um, not, except, uh, you have to post that one picture of that, um, unmentionable thing, that I was talking about, that nobody knows about in America.

28:31.060 --> 28:32.060
I'll have to find it.

28:32.060 --> 28:33.060
I'll find it for you.

28:33.060 --> 28:35.060
Okay, we'll have to find it later.

28:35.060 --> 28:37.060
Neat, um...

28:37.060 --> 28:41.060
I have an F.U. about everything later, by the way, if that's okay with you.

28:41.060 --> 28:42.060
We'll do F.U.s later.

28:42.060 --> 28:43.060
What?

28:43.060 --> 28:45.060
Super toilet, maybe.

28:45.060 --> 28:47.060
Maybe?

28:47.060 --> 28:51.460
Okay, so, moving right along. So, Angel comes back into town, we decide to have a little

28:51.460 --> 28:57.500
welcome home party last night, so that's why everybody was here. Almost everybody! Somebody

28:57.500 --> 29:02.500
forgot to, I don't know, inform me that this stuff was going on! Everyone's like, everyone's

29:02.500 --> 29:06.420
like, hey, you going to the party? What party? There was a frickin' huge party here last

29:06.420 --> 29:10.500
night, there was like, literally everybody was there, and everyone's still here. It was

29:10.500 --> 29:14.740
not my job to send out the invitations, I thought everybody knew through the chat room,

29:14.740 --> 29:17.380
I thought Angel was harassing everybody as they came to the chat room.

29:17.380 --> 29:25.380
I didn't even know about it until we looked in your live journal.

29:25.380 --> 29:27.860
Yeah, I didn't even know about it, so fuck you.

29:27.860 --> 29:33.300
I brought it up to her and she's like, what party?

29:33.300 --> 29:37.740
It wasn't supposed to be a party, it was supposed to be friends come over and we hang out and

29:37.740 --> 29:38.740
then we go to Scandia.

29:38.740 --> 29:42.220
We're going to have a social gathering and have a good caravan that goes to Scandia.

29:42.220 --> 29:45.220
Suddenly, oh my gods, there's a party going on in my house.

29:45.220 --> 29:47.220
Well dude, there was popin' music.

29:47.220 --> 29:49.220
I mean, it's popin'!

29:49.220 --> 29:52.220
What's that stand in there?

29:52.220 --> 29:54.220
I brought germania.

29:54.220 --> 29:55.220
Yeah, you did, didn't you?

29:55.220 --> 29:56.220
Yes, I did.

29:56.220 --> 29:57.220
But there was popin'.

29:57.220 --> 29:59.220
And Rob's all like,

29:59.220 --> 30:01.220
Angel's coming, Angel's coming, Angel's coming!

30:01.220 --> 30:03.220
Do a theater near you!

30:05.220 --> 30:08.220
This summer, Angel...

30:08.220 --> 30:15.220
Angel returns, coming to a theater near you this summer.

30:15.220 --> 30:18.220
Anyway, yeah. Hi.

30:18.220 --> 30:22.220
So, we had a party, and we watched Battle Royale, because Angel hadn't seen this movie.

30:22.220 --> 30:25.220
And if you haven't seen Battle Royale yet, Jamie, break it down.

30:25.220 --> 30:28.220
Talk about what Battle Royale's all about, for those who haven't seen.

30:28.220 --> 30:35.220
In the future, students boycott school, so the Japanese government decides to enact the B.E.R. Act,

30:35.220 --> 30:42.220
which means that they figure randomly selected 9th grade class, put them all on an island, and they have to kill each other until one's left.

30:42.220 --> 30:46.220
There's a lot more symbolic meaning behind that.

30:46.220 --> 30:48.220
True, but I like watching all the deaths.

30:48.220 --> 30:52.220
But watching a whole bunch of really pretty Japanese people kill each other is a sheer joy in life.

30:52.220 --> 30:54.220
Dude, it was all about Mitsuko.

30:54.220 --> 30:57.220
I don't want to be a loser.

30:57.220 --> 30:59.220
Jayama, my hero.

30:59.220 --> 31:03.220
He was my hero. If he was a good guy, it would have been better.

31:03.220 --> 31:09.220
The guy who had the radio that told me where everybody else was, I would have lived a lot longer than he did, you know?

31:09.220 --> 31:11.220
Dude, he lived a long time.

31:11.220 --> 31:16.220
That was Hiroki who had the GPS, but my favorite was Mimura, the hacker.

31:16.220 --> 31:17.220
He's Mimura.

31:17.220 --> 31:23.220
He was so awesome, and I finally caught the pun of the name of his computer, the third man.

31:23.220 --> 31:24.220
Ah.

31:24.220 --> 31:27.220
After his own name, Mimura.

31:27.220 --> 31:32.220
But then of course after we watched Battle Royale, what did you think of Battle Royale, Angel? The first time seeing it?

31:32.220 --> 31:35.620
It kicked much ass, and then we had much fun afterwards.

31:35.620 --> 31:41.860
Yes, after we watched Battle Royale, a battle royale broke out in my living room with paper

31:41.860 --> 31:44.300
plates and magic markers.

31:44.300 --> 31:46.380
And scotch tape and red marker and...

31:46.380 --> 31:50.100
I wrote up name tags for people who died and how they died.

31:50.100 --> 31:53.580
DDR Angel choked on a pretzel.

31:53.580 --> 31:57.740
And all the time I was in the other room playing pop music.

31:57.740 --> 31:59.860
I got hit in the eye with a candle.

31:59.860 --> 32:00.860
Choked on a pretzel?

32:00.860 --> 32:06.740
even want to know she was hanging out with George Bush okay now I know I don't

32:06.740 --> 32:12.380
want to know so now we're thinking gee how can we incorporate battle royale to

32:12.380 --> 32:15.980
our everyday lives and one idea is maybe we could just go to Qsar and take our

32:15.980 --> 32:19.820
frustrations out that way but Qsar is not messy enough so we decided maybe

32:19.820 --> 32:23.460
paintball but then paintball paintballs hurt they really do hurt when they

32:23.460 --> 32:27.620
shall wear loose clothes or thinking doesn't hurt you talk to my friend did

32:27.620 --> 32:29.620
You're trying to get me to buy the gun as well!

32:29.620 --> 32:31.620
Damn you! Damn you!

32:31.620 --> 32:33.620
I know you, Andy!

32:33.620 --> 32:35.620
You've gotten to them also!

32:35.620 --> 32:39.620
What we need to do is we actually need to make the survival packs.

32:39.620 --> 32:41.620
And pick a place, go camping.

32:41.620 --> 32:44.620
And we need to give one person a fan.

32:44.620 --> 32:46.620
Give some person a pellet gun.

32:46.620 --> 32:48.620
You know?

32:51.620 --> 32:53.620
Dude, seriously.

32:53.620 --> 32:55.620
When Battle Royale first came out,

32:55.620 --> 33:00.140
Tokyo Pop the magazine had this big huge feature on it and it had all the weapons of the kids

33:00.140 --> 33:04.700
that you didn't see on TV and there were some seriously ridiculous ones like a pot lid.

33:04.700 --> 33:10.120
Dude the pot lid was the best thing in the movie and it even proved it.

33:10.120 --> 33:12.340
Battle Royale Online dot com.

33:12.340 --> 33:13.340
Go there.

33:13.340 --> 33:14.340
But yeah I mean seriously.

33:14.340 --> 33:19.180
The pot lid was the best and everybody knows it because it saved his life.

33:19.180 --> 33:22.780
Dude the psycho guy Kiriyama he got the freaking Hadasen.

33:22.780 --> 33:25.220
He was my hero and he killed everybody.

33:25.220 --> 33:29.220
And one of the girls who was up on the mountain, like one of them got the megaphone.

33:29.220 --> 33:32.220
The other girl with her got a headband that said, go for it.

33:34.220 --> 33:37.220
But seriously, in my opinion, the best character was our...

33:37.220 --> 33:39.220
Well, I'm not going to give it away. Never mind.

33:39.220 --> 33:43.220
My favorite guy was the other foreign exchange student.

33:43.220 --> 33:44.220
Yeah.

33:44.220 --> 33:45.220
Yeah, how would that give them away?

33:45.220 --> 33:46.220
The one who helped them out.

33:49.220 --> 33:51.220
What would that point be?

33:51.220 --> 33:53.220
One more thing about Japan.

33:53.220 --> 33:58.220
Oh man, you're in the winner's pool, how many does he need to go back and forth?

33:58.220 --> 34:00.220
Yeah, go. Rough.

34:00.220 --> 34:02.220
Anyways!

34:02.220 --> 34:04.220
What do you need now?

34:04.220 --> 34:05.220
Huh?

34:05.220 --> 34:06.220
What do you need?

34:06.220 --> 34:09.220
There's one thing that we roll over Japan, okay?

34:09.220 --> 34:10.220
What?

34:10.220 --> 34:15.220
I saw no, no Extreme Machines over there! None! None!

34:15.220 --> 34:16.220
Really?

34:16.220 --> 34:18.220
And we have them all over the place, so what happens?

34:18.220 --> 34:19.220
Extreme Machines!

34:19.220 --> 34:20.220
DDR is dead.

34:20.220 --> 34:21.220
DDR is dead.

34:21.220 --> 34:22.220
But that means I'm dead.

34:22.220 --> 34:23.220
You're not dead.

34:23.220 --> 34:24.220
Look at the beginning of my name.

34:24.220 --> 34:32.540
You've got to remember that in Japan the fad, the life cycle for fads there is like ridiculously

34:32.540 --> 34:33.540
fast.

34:33.540 --> 34:36.380
You know what, in a year, no not even a year, in like three months you're going to change

34:36.380 --> 34:38.420
your nickname to 2DX Angel.

34:38.420 --> 34:40.180
Because why, what happens?

34:40.180 --> 34:44.100
Everybody gets, everybody gets freaking burned out on DDR and then they're all of a sudden

34:44.100 --> 34:45.100
they're 2DX.

34:45.100 --> 34:47.900
So you'll be 2DX Angel in three months, I guarantee it.

34:47.900 --> 34:50.900
Is 2DX still big there, or is it like, is all the monies dead?

34:50.900 --> 34:53.900
Trust me, she hasn't been getting very good.

34:53.900 --> 34:54.900
Haven't you?

34:54.900 --> 34:58.900
Actually, I got some, like, schoolgirls to, like, take a picture, so it's cool.

34:58.900 --> 34:59.900
They were playing, and they were-

34:59.900 --> 35:01.900
Hey, you can pass, yeah, you can pass 5-1-1.

35:01.900 --> 35:03.900
Loki!

35:03.900 --> 35:05.900
Would you like to make a comment on schoolgirls?

35:05.900 --> 35:07.900
Ooh, schoolgirls.

35:07.900 --> 35:13.900
Roses are red, violets are blue.

35:13.900 --> 35:15.900
This show's about panties.

35:15.900 --> 35:22.520
the back of the colorful DVD that Loki gave us all during March Madness it's

35:22.520 --> 35:27.660
just like what the fuck it's also got an alternate cover in the other side more

35:27.660 --> 35:35.720
panty action you actually see butt crack in that one the one suggestion for

35:35.720 --> 35:40.000
battle royale that didn't get said was that we were all gonna wear white

35:40.000 --> 35:43.780
sweaters or white sweatshirts and white sweatpants and then like have magic

35:43.780 --> 35:44.780
We just draw over each other.

35:44.780 --> 35:45.780
No, no.

35:45.780 --> 35:46.780
We're actually...

35:46.780 --> 35:47.780
I think we do that.

35:47.780 --> 35:48.780
We need to do like actual...

35:48.780 --> 35:50.780
We need to make like fake uniforms or something.

35:50.780 --> 35:51.780
Okay, we would either...

35:51.780 --> 35:53.780
If we all walked around in white shirts...

35:53.780 --> 35:55.780
No, because that's what stands by.

35:55.780 --> 35:59.780
If we all walked around in white shirts and white pants, these people would either think

35:59.780 --> 36:03.780
A, we're doing Battle Royale or B, we're the next Heaven's Gate.

36:03.780 --> 36:04.780
What was that?

36:04.780 --> 36:06.780
That was on Loki's old sig?

36:06.780 --> 36:09.780
Drink the Kool-Aid and follow the comet?

36:09.780 --> 36:10.780
Die, die, die.

36:10.780 --> 36:12.780
Seriously though, we should go back to Q's art.

36:40.780 --> 36:41.780
He's rapping cool.

36:41.780 --> 36:46.220
And then we have like a, a, a Guacamole Del Taco inspired keychain.

36:46.220 --> 36:48.740
He said pull down, should I be afraid yet?

36:48.740 --> 36:51.060
I have Pocari Sweat.

36:51.060 --> 36:53.100
Angel Rules!

36:53.100 --> 36:54.100
Again.

36:54.100 --> 36:55.100
Alright.

36:55.100 --> 37:00.180
On that note, we're gonna go to a quick break, or we're gonna come back and we're gonna do

37:00.180 --> 37:02.140
the FUs of the Week.

37:02.140 --> 37:04.060
Let's play more songs like that.

37:04.060 --> 37:05.700
Or we can talk about news.

37:05.700 --> 37:06.700
What do you wanna do?

37:06.700 --> 37:07.700
Let's do news.

37:07.700 --> 37:10.060
Okay, we'll do, we'll do news when we come back, not FUs just yet.

37:10.060 --> 37:18.060
So, we're going to do songs that suck. No, don't pick them from there. Do this. If you want songs that suck, go to this directory.

37:18.060 --> 37:19.060
No, I want that song, actually.

37:19.060 --> 37:22.060
You do want that? Okay, we're not going to do songs that suck. This one? Okay.

37:22.060 --> 37:23.060
Alright.

37:23.060 --> 37:25.060
But not in the first place. Do them both.

37:25.060 --> 37:30.060
Okay. We'll be back in a little bit and we're going to talk about Bamani news. Oh my god.

37:30.060 --> 37:34.060
And we'll do the FUs of the Week, Cage Match, Match Game. It's all coming up. Thanks for listening.

38:30.060 --> 38:34.140
And it never speaks of me

38:35.660 --> 38:38.940
I'd never create love

38:41.080 --> 38:41.880
No, no, no, no

38:41.880 --> 38:43.220
I don't have enough

38:43.220 --> 38:44.920
Don't have enough

38:44.920 --> 38:45.620
No, no, no, no

38:45.620 --> 38:46.980
I don't have enough

38:46.980 --> 38:48.800
No, no, no, no

38:48.800 --> 38:52.800
I'm the one who wants to feel alive

38:52.800 --> 38:55.800
I'm the one who dreams of people

40:25.800 --> 40:44.160
Sisting in the corner with a coffee cup Reading to me by night looking up

40:44.160 --> 40:49.640
She smiles and she finds funny death Not some light shining in her hair

40:49.640 --> 40:53.920
When she leaves, you want to follow me

40:53.920 --> 40:56.640
When the dress is too tight

40:56.640 --> 41:00.840
But you can't let her see you there

41:00.840 --> 41:04.280
And she's a hot one, and a fiend

41:04.280 --> 41:06.920
Tula senorita

41:06.920 --> 41:09.560
You'll never get close enough

41:09.560 --> 41:11.560
To nothing to be done

41:14.560 --> 41:15.560
Hoorah!

41:16.560 --> 41:17.560
Is that a wizard?

41:19.560 --> 41:20.560
You've got to be kidding me

41:22.560 --> 41:23.560
Oh yeah

41:24.560 --> 41:26.560
I know she has a mind, she has an attitude

41:27.560 --> 41:29.560
And she makes her be solid too

41:30.560 --> 41:31.560
She'll tease you or please you

41:31.560 --> 41:33.560
Feeling good over you

41:33.560 --> 41:35.560
Like you knew she would

41:35.560 --> 41:37.560
When she smiles it's like the

41:37.560 --> 41:40.840
Like the sun shining on your face

41:40.840 --> 41:46.920
Falling and stretching the land of the day

41:46.920 --> 41:50.360
Hanging up, hot water, and the tea, ah

41:50.360 --> 41:52.920
Tula tenorita

41:52.920 --> 41:55.560
Ah, california

41:55.560 --> 41:58.200
Tula tenorita

41:58.200 --> 42:03.320
Tula tenorita

42:03.320 --> 42:05.320
Hooray!

42:33.320 --> 42:59.440
I feel it, I feel it, I feel it You are the only one, let me feel this way

42:59.440 --> 43:23.440
I feel it, I feel it, I feel it You're the only one that makes me feel this way

43:23.440 --> 43:33.440
For the Step Squad to Orange Labs, this media is stocks! Holla!

43:33.440 --> 43:34.440
Stump, stump, stump, stump!

43:34.440 --> 43:36.440
I want a slipper!

43:36.440 --> 43:37.440
That's right, PS!

43:37.440 --> 43:39.440
TTPO!

43:41.440 --> 43:45.440
Hi. You're a little—son of a bitch.

43:45.440 --> 43:47.440
Super Patapata, you're a beast!

43:47.440 --> 43:49.440
I need to turn the repeat thing off. My bad.

43:49.440 --> 43:53.440
You should have seen it earlier at Scandia today. I licked Meg's titties.

43:53.440 --> 43:56.440
Don't do that, please.

43:56.440 --> 43:58.440
Angels got the proof.

43:58.440 --> 44:01.440
Yes, you have photographic proof.

44:01.440 --> 44:06.440
So, um, hi, what were we going to talk about when we come back? Oh yeah, news. Loki, give us news.

44:06.440 --> 44:08.440
Hold it first. Rob?

44:08.440 --> 44:09.440
What?

44:09.440 --> 44:14.440
Photographic proof will be up on www.ungluedbemind.tk tomorrow.

44:14.440 --> 44:16.440
Hooray.

44:16.440 --> 44:25.440
Anyway, so I'm with actual news for once, because we've been lacking for quite a while.

44:25.440 --> 44:26.440
You big dirty liar!

44:26.440 --> 44:27.440
Shut up!

44:27.440 --> 44:32.440
Anyways, we're going to start talking about, first thing of course is going to be MaxTube.

44:32.440 --> 44:37.440
The release is coming out in a couple of weeks actually, for the home versions, and I've

44:37.440 --> 44:39.440
already got it on order, so it's cool.

44:39.440 --> 44:43.440
But what's awesome is it's going to be coming with yet another v-rare, and what's cool is

44:43.440 --> 44:50.440
I think this is going to be a hint at some of the stuff that we're going to see as hidden songs in Max 2, and also as stuff that's going to be DDR Extreme 2.

44:50.440 --> 44:54.440
So, let's go down the list here, um, see...

44:54.440 --> 44:55.440
This is not what I wanted.

44:55.440 --> 44:59.440
Okay, hold on. Let's see, um...

44:59.440 --> 45:02.440
La la la. Oops.

45:02.440 --> 45:05.440
And, let's see here...

45:05.440 --> 45:06.440
There we go.

45:06.440 --> 45:09.440
That's the one that we were just looking at.

45:09.440 --> 45:10.440
Yeah, way to go.

45:10.440 --> 45:12.440
There we go. Alright.

45:12.440 --> 45:22.440
Now, the songs that will be in there. We've got some, it looks like the Max 2 for the home version is going to be the System SF remix of the whole, you know, series.

45:22.440 --> 45:32.440
We've got first brand new song by them, Feelings Won't Fade extended trans mix that's going to be on the V-Rare CD. Plus three songs that are going to be hidden within Max that are going to be long versions of those songs.

45:32.440 --> 45:38.580
We've also got Kind Lady, the Future Trance mix, Midnight Blaze, the System SF mix, Glacial,

45:38.580 --> 45:45.960
which is the brand new Ryu Kosuka song, and an I Feel New Age Hope mix, which is also

45:45.960 --> 45:47.280
by System SF.

45:47.280 --> 45:50.840
Because everyone got a big fat Woody over drop the bomb System SF mix, now it's like,

45:50.840 --> 45:53.760
oh, let's let the dude remix everything.

45:53.760 --> 45:56.220
Yeah?

45:56.220 --> 45:57.220
Pretty much.

45:57.220 --> 45:58.220
Pretty much, I think I summed it up.

45:58.220 --> 46:02.240
But these songs right here, I'm predicting it here, you're going to see those all his

46:02.240 --> 46:06.240
that's hidden songs in Max 2. Those are all going to be hidden songs in there.

46:06.240 --> 46:10.240
And they're also going to be probably in...let's see...

46:10.240 --> 46:14.240
They're also going to be...

46:18.240 --> 46:22.240
Sorry, I flashed Jimmy. Anyways, they're also

46:22.240 --> 46:26.240
going to be hidden songs with...or also going to be new songs for probably the US Max 2

46:26.240 --> 46:30.240
and also going to be in

46:30.240 --> 46:37.240
you know, obviously, DDR Extreme 2, so look for those, and we'll probably have MP3s as well as Bamaiso have MP3s.

46:37.240 --> 46:42.240
They quote six hours after the game comes out, they will have MP3s up on their site, so look for them.

46:42.240 --> 46:44.240
They should have the MP3s there.

46:44.240 --> 46:46.240
Now, also, on top of that, since we're...

46:46.240 --> 46:52.240
Actually, I'd hate to cut you off, but you know, when Max USA came out, we actually went live and played Max USA on air.

46:52.240 --> 46:54.240
We'll do the same thing for Max 2.

46:54.240 --> 46:55.240
Okay.

46:55.240 --> 47:06.240
And let's see now, we've also got, since we were talking about that, more info on Max 2. They've announced some of the playlist, or some of the song list that's going to be there.

47:06.240 --> 47:22.240
It's going to be a lot of, pretty much everything has come back from the arcade version of Max 2, except A Minute, let me see, I believe it is A Minute, the Whistle song, ah shit, there's like four songs that they were cut.

47:22.240 --> 47:24.240
Anyways, so those will not be back.

47:24.240 --> 47:27.240
Um, there's rumors that they're gonna be just, you know,

47:27.240 --> 47:29.240
unlocks, but I don't know.

47:29.240 --> 47:33.240
There's another, there's another picture that they said that they saw a minute in it for the home version,

47:33.240 --> 47:35.240
so it's possible it's an unlock.

47:35.240 --> 47:37.240
Also on top of that, you're gonna have some of the older songs.

47:37.240 --> 47:39.240
You're gonna have Kind Lady and So in Love in there,

47:39.240 --> 47:42.240
plus, you know, Dynamite Rave and all the old, uh, pretty much all the third mixed stuff.

47:42.240 --> 47:43.240
All the barfeed caddas.

47:43.240 --> 47:45.240
Yeah, all those that were in there before.

47:45.240 --> 47:49.240
And there's gonna be some DDR Extreme preview tracks in there.

47:49.240 --> 47:50.240
Like.

47:50.240 --> 47:51.240
Crash.

47:51.240 --> 48:10.240
But here's the thing. It's going to be basically, just like the, which I'll be covering in just a second, the Dancing Stage Megamix, which is going to have Crash, Vanity Angel, and Memories. All the Euromix 2 stuff. So that's what I predict will be in probably Max 2 there, is those three songs, maybe some more, but I'm guessing those three for sure.

48:10.240 --> 48:11.240
Cool.

48:11.240 --> 48:19.240
On top of that, there's going to be oni modes as well, and the ability to make your own custom oni modes.

48:19.240 --> 48:20.240
Neat.

48:20.240 --> 48:22.240
Custom onis, so that'll be kind of cool.

48:22.240 --> 48:24.240
Stop it!

48:24.240 --> 48:29.240
What the fuck are you doing with this stupid hedgehog flying over my damn head?

48:29.240 --> 48:32.240
Or weasel or whatever the fuck that is.

48:32.240 --> 48:37.240
Anyways, so that's what's coming up, we'll have that.

48:37.240 --> 48:47.240
Now, aside from all that, I mean it. I'm going to rip that thing in half.

48:47.240 --> 48:50.240
What? Am I the moki in the middle? Is my moki in the middle?

48:50.240 --> 48:52.240
No, no, no. You're the loki in the middle.

48:52.240 --> 48:56.240
Okay, anyways, so now let's get to some other news other than that.

48:56.240 --> 48:58.240
We'll cover Dancing Stage Megamix in just a second.

48:58.240 --> 49:03.240
Really quickly here, moving along, we've got Popping Music 9 info.

49:03.240 --> 49:06.240
And this is kind of cool. They were talking about, it sounds like it's almost like Bishi Boshi here.

49:06.240 --> 49:35.240
BoshiBoshi here. Now they have Popping Music 9 Imal, which is, I guess, it's going to be a version of Popping Music 9. It's kind of like the powered up versions of Guitar Freaks where it has, you know, the e-cards that are going to go in there, you know, the magnetic cards that store all your data, and you're going to have a lot of different modes in there. Like, for instance, you can, like, swap, I guess you can earn items in this game with the scores that you get to buy stuff and you can send it to each other. They have, well, let's see, let's get to the actual cool stuff.

49:35.240 --> 49:42.240
They've got a minigame in it that's called Bomani that's actually like Beatmania because there's a turntable on this machine.

49:42.240 --> 49:47.240
There's a turntable and two keys, which is kind of weird. Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.

49:47.240 --> 49:52.240
They've got another game called Pooka Pooka, which is in...

49:52.240 --> 49:54.240
Sounds dirty.

49:54.240 --> 50:00.240
This game, you use the buttons to avoid objects while trying to reach the good, whatever the fuck that means.

50:00.240 --> 50:01.120
uh...

50:01.120 --> 50:04.580
entirely practice you know something like that uh... people tennis it pretty

50:04.580 --> 50:06.660
much it sounds like fishy-boshy you know

50:06.660 --> 50:09.640
and they're gonna have some songs uh... new songs

50:09.640 --> 50:10.900
but now

50:10.900 --> 50:11.680
ok

50:11.680 --> 50:13.720
some else

50:13.720 --> 50:17.620
the uh... thing that you've probably been waiting for guitar freaks nine

50:17.620 --> 50:19.820
we found out that they actually have

50:19.820 --> 50:24.400
i don't even wanna know what's going on behind me ok honestly i see flashes of light

50:24.400 --> 50:27.560
and a stupid weasel thing flying around

50:27.560 --> 50:29.380
i don't wanna know

50:29.380 --> 50:31.420
what you guys are taking pictures of

50:31.420 --> 50:33.820
especially since it's around my ass

50:33.820 --> 50:38.340
i'm really afraid to see what that stupid thing is doing to my ass ok

50:38.340 --> 50:39.300
so anyways

50:39.300 --> 50:42.140
now guitar freaks

50:42.140 --> 50:45.900
we've got a lot of transplants songs from pop music that are going to be in it

50:45.900 --> 50:50.500
plus some pretty cool shit we've got uh... apple and honey from pop music that's going to be in there

50:50.500 --> 50:55.200
uh... c777 from pop music impulse of blue now that sounds like blue impulse

50:55.200 --> 50:57.380
but you know it's probably a different song

50:57.380 --> 50:59.540
uh... i'm a loser

50:59.540 --> 51:02.700
that's going to be in their uh... we've got the extra stage as being quite a

51:02.700 --> 51:06.740
skill by jimmy wack also might remember he is the guy that did uh... across the

51:06.740 --> 51:07.540
nightmare

51:07.540 --> 51:11.300
we've also got the on court stage from dance maniacs mad black by the

51:11.300 --> 51:14.300
infection which is really awesome so

51:14.300 --> 51:17.540
uh... that bonus tracks we're gonna have you know some longer since i think we

51:17.540 --> 51:22.660
have a dream tonight uh... twinkle star cries in the wilderness and

51:22.660 --> 51:27.060
uh... used to rock and roll that is in an election system the black horizon

51:27.060 --> 51:31.260
sounds pretty sweet. And they have an encore stage of model DD4 which I believe is a sequel

51:31.260 --> 51:36.180
to another song they did. Oh dear. Let's see, now license songs, they're really cool. They've

51:36.180 --> 51:42.560
got Party Hard by Andrew W.K. You might remember that song. They've also got Show Business

51:42.560 --> 51:50.180
by ACDC. Oh dear god. No! No! No! No! No! And Mr. Children, I recognize Mr. Children,

51:50.180 --> 51:56.780
or Cross River Mr. Children I think. But there's some other J-Rock stuff in there too, I don't

51:56.780 --> 52:06.020
no j-rock so I mean I don't know look at the list um he told me is the one who

52:06.020 --> 52:13.760
did my sweet darlin all right and she has a song called a Dante now now that's

52:13.760 --> 52:16.940
all out of the way that's all about guitar freaks night and drum meeting

52:16.940 --> 52:22.560
eighth yes so now we're gonna have Wow I'm so moist in anticipation of guitar

52:22.560 --> 52:27.560
That's just gross.

52:27.560 --> 52:34.560
Okay, now, finally, with the list of the song, the game will probably never play because it's in Europe. Fucking Europeans.

52:34.560 --> 52:40.560
They've got a brand new dancing stage megamix. It's going to be basically equivalent to R-Max 2 or whatever.

52:40.560 --> 52:45.560
Anyways, it's going to have seven licensed songs, Stealing Beats by Kid Galahad.

52:45.560 --> 52:46.560
Never heard of it.

52:46.560 --> 52:48.560
Love at First Sight by Kylie Minogue.

52:48.560 --> 52:49.560
I have that, we can play it.

52:49.560 --> 52:51.560
Love Cats by The Cure.

52:51.560 --> 52:56.560
That's so awesome that the Cure gets into DDR, and it's a shitty song.

52:56.560 --> 53:06.560
When you look at me by Christina Milan, shake your body by Shai FX and T-Power featuring D.J.

53:06.560 --> 53:09.560
One Step Closer by S. John G.

53:09.560 --> 53:11.560
And a little less conversation Elvis vs. J. X.

53:11.560 --> 53:14.560
Little less conversation. Little less conversation.

53:14.560 --> 53:19.560
I don't know the fucking word, but I'm just going to make them up.

53:19.560 --> 53:24.560
They're pretty much going to have the same shit we're going to have on our DDR Max 2.

53:24.560 --> 53:31.560
It's going to be all the Konami Originals, plus the preview songs from DDR Extreme.

53:31.560 --> 53:33.560
Same shit there.

53:33.560 --> 53:35.560
But here's what the funny part is.

53:35.560 --> 53:39.560
Their unlock system. Their unlock system is a joke.

53:39.560 --> 53:44.560
Isn't it like you just play a song? You don't even have to pass it. You just play it and then...

53:44.560 --> 53:45.960
Dink! You get an unlock!

54:14.560 --> 54:21.560
3 unlocks, you get training mode, 6 points, you get edit mode, you get 10 points and pass

54:22.840 --> 54:29.840
70 songs, you get max 300, 15 points and 100 songs, you get endless modes. Whoopity-doo.

54:34.560 --> 54:38.560
What a shit. Alright, that's it, that's all the news I have. Yay, that was wonderful.

54:38.560 --> 54:42.880
Oh, and if the DDR Extreme OST came out, the non-stop sucks ass. That's it. Why does the

54:42.880 --> 54:52.420

Loki, you want to introduce this song?

56:22.440 --> 56:23.440
Yes.

56:23.440 --> 56:25.440
This is the remix that I did for Jamie.

56:25.440 --> 56:27.440
For her brand new F.U. music.

that was uh... the world premiere of slag work the dark sacral fuck you up

58:31.920 --> 58:34.880
mixed by low-key

58:34.880 --> 58:36.840
very cool and and

58:36.840 --> 58:38.440
and the best thing about it

58:38.440 --> 58:40.280
uses the f word a lot

58:40.280 --> 58:43.120
like that

58:43.120 --> 58:47.560
it's the first good one dedicated to me

58:47.560 --> 58:51.480
angel got jamie a happy bunny for her

58:51.480 --> 58:52.780

58:52.780 --> 58:54.080
That was very cool.

58:54.080 --> 58:57.220
OK, kids, so is that your new FU theme then?

58:57.220 --> 58:58.720
OK, yes, that's the new FU theme.

58:58.720 --> 58:59.220
Great.

58:59.220 --> 59:00.060
That was fucked up.

59:00.060 --> 59:04.560
So I guess now before we get to the FUs of the week,

59:04.560 --> 59:07.360
I have to give everyone in the room a lecture.

59:07.360 --> 59:10.800
Last week, the FUs of the week went on for like an hour.

59:10.800 --> 59:12.560
So let's try to keep them short tonight.

59:12.560 --> 59:16.160
Think about what your FUs of the week are now.

59:16.160 --> 59:17.680
Think about what your FUs of the week

59:17.680 --> 59:19.600
are now before the microphone gets to you.

59:19.600 --> 59:21.280
Thank you.

59:21.280 --> 59:25.280
Why am I still trying to pull up the terror mix of slag work? I do not know.

59:25.280 --> 59:30.280
Okay, let's start it off with the only woman who can start this off, the FUs of the week.

59:35.280 --> 59:38.280
I had aches at one moment, and now it's all gone.

59:38.280 --> 59:45.280
Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is a fucked up.

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:19.280
the battle royale of the roads, with me as the victor, and them all lying in bloody, burned, ooh, a tank! Oh, that's right, I need a tank! Somebody give me a tank.

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:33.280
And my other fight goes toward, my birthday is on the 19th, okay? And I can't go do my normal thing that I do because I don't have money, so someone buy me the battle royale novel, thank you.

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:37.280
Alright, moving on, let's hear it from Loki.

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:40.280
Damn it, I missed...

01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:43.280
I, like, forgot a lot of them. But that's alright, that's alright, that's alright.

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:46.280
Alright, uh, start it off.

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:50.280
Um, big eff you to the stupid bitch that was sitting next to us.

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:54.280
Actually, big bitch that was sitting next to us at the movie theater yesterday.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:59.280
First off, there was plenty of other seats, but no, your fat ass had to move in front of us before the show.

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.280
We did before the show!

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.820
their statement of the kids that next to me too

01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:05.260
and then they're fucking

01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:07.560
after all that she

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:10.540
you know having your cell phone on during the movie and then they arrange

01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:13.920
the evidence are talking to the public set up so i

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.840
and i hear it there with the fact

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.960
uh... began to offer to the stupid uh...

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:21.000
bastards that

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.280
drive cars in parking lot

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:27.740
when i get back out the fucking work your car behind mine

01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:32.300
The next time you do that, I'm gonna back up at full speed and kill you.

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:35.840
That's it. Simple as that. Especially if you're just a pedestrian standing there,

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:39.300
that's even worse, so make it nice and easy for me to run over you.

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:40.660
So, um, yeah.

01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:43.820
So don't get in my way in, uh, parking lots.

01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:47.580
Stop distracting me to all this pencil crap!

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:48.460
Seriously!

01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:49.820
Are you, are you done?

01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:54.340
No, I'm not done! He bothered me!

01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:56.380
Are you done now?

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:58.900
um...

01:01:58.900 --> 01:02:00.660
for now because i can't remember

01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:02.140
they'll come back

01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:04.560
i have a few ideas of the week i'd like to get out

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:08.940
my first f u goes to daylight savings time

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:10.740
no it's my turn hold on

01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:12.300
hold on we'll go back we'll go back

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:15.020
my first f u goes to daylight savings time what the fuck

01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:16.700
an hour of sleep lost

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:19.960
because somebody decided we needed more suns so the children can play outdoors

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:23.980
uh... act like that you're killed rob not safe to play on actually because um...

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:28.820
you know, the year isn't exactly 365 days, and that there's an actual, you know, wait,

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:30.340
no, that's leap years. Never mind, I don't know.

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:34.800
I don't give a shit. It sucks my balls. Not every country celebrates it. Why do we have

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:46.120
to? I lost an hour of sleep. Lick me. Arizona rules. Okay. Uh, what else? Yeah, Arizona

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:51.340
doesn't celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day either. They're kind of fucked up. Um, uh,

01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:56.960
else am I trying to think of? Oh, there was something else. FU to having a crush and not

01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:08.960
knowing what to do with it. I hate that. FU to traffic. I hate cars. FU to... FU to zero.

01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:14.600
He's looking at me funny. I'm just kidding. I couldn't think of anything else. Alright,

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:20.600
back to Logi. This is going to be an FU to pretty much everyone that was not competing

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:24.760
I don't put judges for here. I don't listen you stupid bastard

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:30.780
I worked hours on the fucking audio setup the reason you can't hear yourself the mic cuz you're whispering into the fucking mic

01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:34.240
Talk loudly I did sound check so you can hear people

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:40.700
Yes, I can't hear myself because I'm talking really quietly turn it up turn it up speak louder. You stupid bastard

01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:46.000
That news the guy that played Simon you really sucked you pushed out man

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
I like that guy. He was great.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Well, he pussed out, man.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.000
He was good, but had failure not had bronchitis.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000
He pussed out. I could have been a better Simon.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
That's right. I would have hated everyone, so I guess I couldn't have done that.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Well, there might be something involving American Idol on this station in the future.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Who knows? Ideas are going around.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Anyway, so F you tonight, and F you for eBay for having me addicted.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
I'm done.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Alright, moving on. Let's go around the room. We'll start with, what? Let's start with Tal. He's over here. We'll go this way.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Alright, Tal, kick it off. What's up?

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000
I'd like to give a nice fuck you to, oh, everybody who's ever gone to Scandia.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Except for, you know, my friend, because we're intelligent people.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
We know what English is. We speak it. We know how to read it.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000
We know what it means to be able to follow instructions. You know?

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Yes, this is the best background ever.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000
And I'd like to give a...

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Dude, there's some seriously retarded people out there. It's so scary.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:53.000
I want to know, just how many people, when we came back after the tournament,

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.000
while I was playing 2DX, how many people came up with that token machine?

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Put money in it. When it said, please use another changer.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Dude, you know...

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
People are stupid and can't read.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
And one person was like, oh my god, the machine stopped working.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.360
And I stopped in my game and said, read the sign.

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:14.400
You know what area Scandia is located at, right?

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:16.320
You have to leave people who are illiterate there.

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:19.200
Yeah, but people are just as stupid who go to RVGL.

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:22.600
There's nothing that made me want to go back and get my college degree.

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:26.280
At least there are more retards at RVGL than at Scandia.

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:28.240
No, dude, seriously.

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:32.400
Until you work, there are retards that work in RVGL.

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:37.400
There's retards at Scandia, and then there's just people who expect other people to afford them at RNG.

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:40.400
And then it's like this, people at Scandia don't have a choice, the people at RNG don't do.

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:42.400
That isn't even worse.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.400
It's usually, it boggles the brain.

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:47.400
And um, let's see, what else would I like to do next year?

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:48.400
Yes.

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:54.400
I'd like to give a nice big fakirigitaru, man, because I don't have it, and I really, really want it.

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.400
And it's like...

01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:02.400
And, um, wait, God, I had a whole list of them today, but I don't remember, so I'll come back.

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:06.400
Wait, no, I won't. I'll keep this, because I'm on my court.

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:08.400
My turn!

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:15.400
Okay, uh, my first, my first lucky goes to being broke.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:25.400
Because I have, like, I am, I had to live off $20 this weekend because that's, like, almost all I have left until I get more luck.

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:30.400
Fuck you to expiring ATM cards. I've had no money this weekend.

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.400
Okay, well...

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.400
It's still the chase, yeah.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:35.400
Okay.

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:36.400
Now, uh...

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.400
Oh, yeah.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:40.400
Okay, well, anyway, um, also...

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:43.400
Fuck you to bad grades.

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:44.400
Cause it sucks.

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.400
Shut up!

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.400
Hey, man.

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:47.400
I'm just fucking with you, man.

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:49.400
No more messing around, man.

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:51.400
And also...

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:54.400
Fuck my bike, because it got another flat tire.

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.400
Yeah, on my bike.

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:58.400
Yes.

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:04.400
And, the old GPAs for not having lights on them, I put one in.

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:08.400
Yes, I know about the afterburner, and I'm too cheap to get one.

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.400
So I just use a bike light under my chin.

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:19.400
I have like a light shielding, but it sucks.

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:36.800
Next time you guys go BAAAAA in the middle of a great song like Daikon-Kai, just kill

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:37.800
yourself first.

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:38.800
Oh, shut up.

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:39.800
Hey, Anita's here.

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:40.800
Hey, Anita.

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:41.800
Okay, Nick.

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.800
Oh, hey, Anita's here, right, Anita?

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:45.800
Okay, Nick.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:55.800
Fuck the judges for making me stop in the middle of my guacamole del taco routine.

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:58.800
I was, like, 95% of the way done.

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:00.800
Just because I was, like, failing my song.

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.800
You know what? Sorry to cut you off. I fucking agree with that.

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:05.800
You paid your money to be up there. It doesn't matter what other people think.

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:07.800
You paid your money. You should get to do your dance.

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:10.800
The gong is a stupid idea. And eat me.

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:12.800
Thank you.

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:14.800
I wish I had a dog.

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:18.800
Fucking single and fuck the whole thing.

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:21.800
And I agree with the whole crush thing.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:24.800
It's a bitch.

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:26.800
Anyways, no, I got a few fucksies actually.

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.800
Yeah, fuck you to the judges for stopping you.

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:31.800
That pissed me off more than anything.

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:34.800
I wanted to get up and start hitting people, then I want to get sent home.

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:39.800
Fuck you to losing my voice after doing Orange Lounge all weekend last week.

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:45.800
I couldn't talk for like two days afterwards, but it was fun.

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:47.800
Zero's a hero!

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:49.800
Shush!

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:58.800
And uh, yeah, fuck you to the people who were making fun of the DDR Idol contestants because I really didn't see you guys get up there and do anything.

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:00.800
Yeah, let's see you get some balls!

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:02.800
Yeah, or something.

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:06.800
I'm so in love with you

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:10.800
Anyway, this is pointless. It's like microphone juggling. What?

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:13.800
Thanks Lizzie for bailing me out earlier, it saved my life

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:25.800
Yeah, fuck you to all those stupid bastards who pointed the fashion when I stumbled on a challenge that caused me to have a damn great day

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:42.800
Yeah, fuck you to all the blondes in Scandia, well the customer blondes that aren't us. Yeah, they're all fucking jackasses that need to just go live at RBGL for a month.

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:47.800
Um, yeah, fuck you being tired, and fuck you daylight time because I lost an hour.

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:51.800
And fuck you for Battle Royale, and here's the reason why.

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:57.800
We didn't see all the deaths. I wanted to see all of the apartment 40 deaths or whatever.

01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:00.800
I wanted to see each and every one of you in detail.

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:03.800
How every one happened. Some of them you just hear they die.

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:07.800
Huh? No, I want to get it. And I want to get the script too.

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:12.800
And fuck you to trying to get your computer networked, because it never seems to happen.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:15.800
Did they get that done yet? Networking to computers?

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.800
Okay, I'm done.

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:24.800
Angel's turn, is it?

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:34.800
Alright, I'd like to say, fuck you to jet lag, because I haven't been able to...

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:41.800
Hey, hey! Hi, Floor! Thank you. Oh, it got really crazy! How nice!

01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:48.800
Alright, fuck you to Jetlag, because I haven't been able to get used to the time since I got back on Thursday.

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:57.800
I haven't been getting any sleep. Ask Rob, because he knows that I only got 25 minutes of sleep last night.

01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:06.800
Well, wait, that doesn't help, because Black Lab, myself, and, uh, Dark Tetsuya, we're playing 2DX all night long, anyway.

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:07.800
Game on you.

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:14.800
Anyways, yeah, fuck you to Jetlag, and fuck you to, uh, Airplane Food, because it sucks.

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:16.800
Not all the time, but this time it sucks.

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:21.800
Alright.

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:24.800
Big major fuck you to Trapper Jam.

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:34.560
How the hell am I supposed to get from SACTO to Novato within 90 minutes if it's on a two-lane

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:39.520
road, 35 miles per hour, bumper to bumper?

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:42.600
That's why we were late.

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:46.320
Fuck you, dude, you're just a pussy-ass, Simon.

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:51.500
All of the judges, number one, were gonging DT.

01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:53.500
Or two.

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:55.180
Simon actually passed me.

01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:57.180
And then this whole time.

01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:58.660
He just completely pushed out.

01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:01.140
Oh, that's fine.

01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:04.740
And I'm spinning.

01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:07.420
All right, let's move on.

01:12:07.420 --> 01:12:07.980
Yay.

01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:09.900
Well, we have the chat room FUs, so let's get

01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:10.820
to the chat room FUs.

01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:15.140
OK, we have Justin wants to say, F you to Friday night.

01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:17.580
No one at Scandia, and there was this girl playing DDR,

01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:20.180
and I was playing with her, but she had no idea how to play.

01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:22.940
And then I tried telling her, and she's like, well, I don't remember what she said.

01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:25.460
Something in Spanish, because she didn't even speak English.

01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:29.880
On a good note, I'm getting a free customized CD from LED Records, which is Judy Crystal,

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:32.460
Maria Shore, Priscilla, and Rose's producer.

01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:35.700
And an F.U. to the troll lady I saw driving with missing teeth.

01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:37.980
Ehh!

01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:44.020
Ness151 would like to say a big, hearty F.U. to DDRCoralville for not giving free tokens,

01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:48.260

Oh my god, there's not a more godly person than Mr. Rogers ever. You can't possibly protest

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:12.400
anything the band ever did.

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:16.240

Vidpowah would like to say, F you to homework, F you to getting teacher recommendations.

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:46.760
I always thought that was a good thing, but whatever. And F you to not being able to get

01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:50.700
the turntable on the right-hand side of BeatMania 2DX when I'm playing on first player, but

01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:56.640
other than that, 2DX is awesome. It's not that hard. It didn't work. Hit the white key.

01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:01.040
Then go to save. He did everything he said. I think it'll only work when you're playing

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.040
I think that's what's going on.

01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:03.040
Oh, well, yeah.

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:07.800
What, is he trying to do it by himself?

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:08.800
I don't know.

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:09.800
I have no idea.

01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:10.800
I'm sorry.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.800
Just use the second player side.

01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:15.120
Yeah, just do it on the two player side.

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:16.120
There must be something.

01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:18.040
There's some greater scheme going on.

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:19.040
I don't know.

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:21.040
Anyway, that does it for the FUs of the week.

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:24.400
Hooray, we're through it.

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:26.560
I feel like just moving right on into the cage match.

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:28.280
What do you guys say?

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:29.280
Sure.

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:30.280
Let's do that.

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:32.280
I've got to cue some things up.

01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:36.280
Okay, that CD's all ready to go, but I need to cue up this CD as well.

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:42.280
So, does anybody else have anything they'd like to say about the FUs of the Week while I'm trying to cue up some cage match things?

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:44.280
No.

01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:47.280
No.

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:50.280
We'll come up with something.

01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:52.280
I like traffic.

01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:53.280
Oh, wait, what?

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:55.280
No!

01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:56.280
No!

01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:58.280
Throwing ferrets back and forth is fun.

01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:02.280
Yes, it is. Isn't it? Isn't it fun?

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:04.280
Yes, isn't it fun, Loki?

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:06.280
Isn't it fun?

01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:10.280
Oh, you were saying something? Sorry, I was playing with my watch.

01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:13.280
Ah, screw that.

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:16.280
Where's the ferret? I want to throw it some more. Give me the ferret.

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:19.280
It's only better.

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:23.280
I stepped on my back and almost slipped as it fell.

01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:33.280
Irene's trying to tell me about a new segment on the show she thinks we should do. It's called Orange Crush, and I'm getting the information on this as she's telling me here.

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:43.280
Basically, you ask Bamani trivia and see how many answers the person can come up with in 30 seconds. Okay, I like this so far. Keep going. Keep going. Yes. Yes.

01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:46.280
By the way, fuck these lights.

01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:56.920

01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:05.980
you know we actually have time to like prep trivia questions it's the

01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:09.880

01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:19.320

Here it is, here's a clip of last week's winner. Oh, the way the cage match works, we play three songs, we only play a clip of the song that won last time, and then you vote, and the song you vote as winner goes into rotation on Orange Lounge with Monty Music Amore, which plays all the time on this station when we're not here.

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:58.200
If this guy is that lazy, that's the app.

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:05.200
Here it is, this is Opera Trance with Spente and Lestelli, this is last week's winner and we're going to play just a clip of it.

E das sua speranza preghe

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:42.880
Ura storiga

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:44.880
La maharo pianto

01:19:44.880 --> 01:20:14.840

Um, JB sent me this.

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:31.840
JB sent you this, but do you want to even say what it is? Or is this just going to be Jamie's pick?

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:36.840
The Wildside Queen of Love speed version, and I bet people will recommend it if it plays well tonight.

01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:39.740
I'm feeling, feeling good

01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:36.140
All right, that is WildSide, who's—WildSide's been a pretty popular pick in the cage match

01:25:36.140 --> 01:25:46.140
Wildside has been in the cage match quite a little bit lately. That was Queen of Love, and you might have recognized that as being Baek Hwa from 3rd Korean.

01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:56.140
So, let's go around the room and see what everyone thought of Wildside, Queen of Love, starting with Puppy.

01:25:56.140 --> 01:26:04.140
It sounded like the original version a lot. It's kind of a cool song, but I'd say a 7.5.

01:26:04.140 --> 01:26:27.140
I think it's a big five, because it sucks, and I hate Wildside, and yeah, it sucked, the original was better, Wildside sucks, because they can't do any of their own songs, they just do covers and they suck ass, and PsyFam sucks as a piss-off baby.

01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:34.140
Okay, so that kind of does its side, but I definitely have it just against the wild side.

01:26:34.140 --> 01:26:37.140
I'll give it a four and a half. Angel?

01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:52.140
Uh, it did sound like a lot, uh, a lot like the original, but, uh, I don't know, it was alright. I'd say four.

01:26:52.140 --> 01:27:18.140
I like it because my Itoko sent it to me. It gets a 12.

01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:28.140
But Quaz better, it really is, but it's not bad. I'd listen to that on a rainy day.

01:27:28.140 --> 01:27:31.140
I'd, uh, I'd give it a... seven?

01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:34.140
Okay. So. Alright, my pick.

01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:37.140
Um, I was gonna pick a different song. I was gonna pick a song.

01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:40.140
Okay, last night at a party, this guy, Garrett, who's new in town that plays 2D-

01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:42.140
Well, he's not really new in town, actually. He's lived here his whole life.

01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:45.140
But he kind of just is- he's new to the Sac-Bomani scene.

01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:50.140
We saw him randomly playing 2DX one night, and we just kind of sucked him up into our little circle.

01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:53.140
And, uh, turns out he owns a copy of Amplitude.

01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:54.140
You haven't met him yet.

01:27:55.140 --> 01:27:57.140
Alright, um, he has Amplitude.

01:27:57.140 --> 01:27:59.640
He brought that over to the little shindig we had last night.

01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:03.140
And there's a song on there I fuckin' love by Freezepop,

01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:04.640
called Sup-

01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:07.140
by, uh, it's called Supersprode by Freezepop.

01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:08.140
However!

01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:12.640
Can I talk- can I speak? Can I speak? Can I finish? Can I finish?

01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:14.140
No. Anyway.

01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:17.640
Uh, but I couldn't find a copy of Supersprode, which kinda sucks.

01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:22.640
But I did find another song by Freezepop that kicks a lot of ass, so this is my cage match pick for this week.

01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:30.640
This is Science Genius Girl, and this is my cage match pick from Freezepop, so enjoy!

01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:55.640
I want the science fair

01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:58.640
I wear a white black suit

01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:02.640
Here they stand with my hair

01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:05.640
When I close the human being

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:09.640
It will want to hold my hand

01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:12.640
When I close the human being

01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:16.640
It will be a member of my band

01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:20.640
It will be, it will be

01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:23.640
It will be a member of my band

01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:26.640
Before I go to school

01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:30.640
It will be a member of my band

01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:49.640
Science is the method current, the theorems speak to me

01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:53.640
Microscope is in my hand

01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:57.640
Fun's welcome to a new screen

01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:04.640
When I close a human being It will want to hold my hand

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:12.640
When I close a human being It will be a member of my band

01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:22.640
It will be a member of my band

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:26.640
It will be the number of one hell

01:30:52.640 --> 01:31:00.640
Measure out the chemicals, safety goggles on my eyes

01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:07.640
Turn the vents and burner on, my creation comes alive

01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:14.640
I have closed my human being, it is here and holds my hand

01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:25.640
I have closed my human being, It is now a member of my band.

01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:35.640
It is now a member of my band, It is now a member of my band.

01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:39.640
My man, I am not a human being

01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:42.640
It is you and not my man

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:46.640
My man, I am not a human being

01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:50.640
It is now the number of my man

01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:18.640
That's what it gets.

01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:21.640
A weak burp for a weak tongue.

01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:28.640
Not good, not good, not good.

01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:30.640
Sorry Rob!

01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:32.640
Okay, three.

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:42.640
I liked it except it was kinda making me fall asleep.

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:44.640
Whatever, whatever.

01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:46.640
Okay, um...

01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:48.640
I like...

01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:50.640
Not your turn.

01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:55.640
Now you're going last, so you can wait, Angel.

01:32:56.640 --> 01:33:00.640
I really did like the beat, but, you know...

01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:02.640
Okay, fine.

01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:04.640
Six. Zero.

01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:08.640
You know she just gave you that sportsy feel, dude.

01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:12.400
no okay first of all i don't remember which fucking game that was from

01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:16.000
i don't care i must i really must not have paid attention to that crappy ass

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:20.000
song okay i heard the fucking dwi to that and i

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.800
thought it was cool for like negative four seconds it was cool before

01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:28.640
it started even though there was a dwi okay the best the best part about that

01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:34.160
song was when it ended i gave it a negative 80 million

01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:37.120
but don't worry rob though because you know that song that you were talking

01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:44.120
It's not Wildside and it's not the Ketchum song. I'll give it a 6.5.

01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:11.280
I mean and he would be better okay I just went this way I can see why it was

01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:14.720
in frequency because it probably cost nothing to license that's it sucks major

01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:22.880
ass so I'm giving it a 1 a 1 so I mean I know you people out there who just

01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:27.120
vote against my song because you try to piss me off I don't care because I'll

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:33.720
come back stronger better faster oh yeah one last thing as for the previous song

01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:36.720
I enjoy this song very well. I give it an 8.

01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:48.720
I know this is really, really late and out of segment, but F you stupid AOL commercials, because I don't want to see an icon sleep with some ugly hoe. That's it.

01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:52.720
Okay, as late as that comment was, I'll ignore it.

01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:54.720
Of course, because AOL's got a spree anyway.

01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:57.720
Yes?

01:34:57.720 --> 01:34:58.720
Shut the hell up!

01:34:58.720 --> 01:34:59.720
Speak!

01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:12.560
that song owns freeze-pop owns you yes they do 10 I thought that song is pretty

01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:18.840
good now like it on frequency so I give it an 8 now I give this a perfect score

01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:22.720
and let me tell you why okay we I sat down I patiently listen to all your

01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:26.760
bullshit and so you're gonna listen to me now okay first up freeze-pop science

01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:32.760
Science Genius Girl, a band out of Boston. They're playing modern new wave music from the Electroclash school of style, okay?

01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:34.760
They're mod-

01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:37.760
These guys fucking own you for free.

01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:39.760
This- no. Fuck you. Sit down.

01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:42.760
I'm gonna wait. I'll wait. I'm gonna wait. Go ahead. I'm gonna wait.

01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:47.760
Now check this out. Science Genius Girl is a brilliant composition.

01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:53.760
It's a really well made new wave song. It's a really well made modern industrial pop song, okay?

01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:58.640
The song is really cool, and it's fun. It's fun to play and make the game better and

01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:04.860
Yeah, shut the fuck up. You're like. You don't know what the hell you're talking about anyways because you're like. Oh my god. It sucks

01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:08.640
The thing is that okay, no hold on

01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:13.120
You know what the only reason why you know all this shit about this band is because you have to make up for how much they

01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:14.840
fucking suck

01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:20.200
If they sucked I wouldn't care if they suck that you would care you're carried right now. They suck

01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:23.200
Fuck! Listen to the song again!

01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:26.200
I have like seven remixes, I have their album!

01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:31.200
That's sad, did you find it like a five cent bin? Seriously!

01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:36.200
Seven remixes what? They had to take seven fucking times to make it right?

01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:39.200
You're a hoe man! You're a hoe!

01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:43.200
Well at least I can go through with my mother!

01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:45.200
Everyone shut up!

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:47.200
Your dog was better!

01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:49.200
Thank you, now that you've all shut up...

01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:54.200
I've never seen a case match get so fucking heated.

01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:56.200
I just didn't like that one.

01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:58.200
That's why I wanted to get a burp.

01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:03.200
Rob, the ketchup song? What in the hell did I miss in five weeks?

01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:06.200
Rob, do you have a hickey on your ass yet?

01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:09.200
From that side of the room, you got a hickey on your ass.

01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:12.200
Can we ask for the votes, please?

01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:16.200
Alright, let's recap what you can vote for.

01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:18.200
Oh my god.

01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:23.200
Forgive me for liking people like Fisher, Booter, and Freefall, man. I go to clubs like that.

01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:25.200
No one else gives a microphone!

01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:30.200
The chat room says Cage Match is turning into an actual Cage Match. Time to vote!

01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:34.200
Okay, your first song you can vote for. Here's a clip.

01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:37.200
Opera Trance, Bente Lestelli, last week's winner.

01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:49.200
All right, next one you can vote for, Wild Side, Queen of Love.

01:37:49.200 --> 01:38:05.200
All right, last one, the ever controversial Freeze Pop with Science Genius Girl.

01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:14.200
A member of my band, a member of my band

01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:38.200
Put your ass down in that chair and drink your goddamn tea.

01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:42.200
Yeah, I put it in my head, chair, or tea.

01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:46.200
It's a Final Fantasy quote. It's the best video game quote ever.

01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:48.200
It's sin.

01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:55.200
Dead air! Yay!

01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:01.200
Sorry, I had to type that out for the chat rooms. I could see what they could move for.

01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:03.200
Let's get a break so that, like, Sam first can calm down.

01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:06.000
okay let's go to break there but it's going to be doing some yoga

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.120
it was interesting to know that i don't like turning into wonderland

01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:11.520
work and is now

01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:14.360
we let let lucky i'm sorry

01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:16.080
yes i will bring up yet

01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:18.080
yes

01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:19.080
and i think

01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:20.720
more than the pressing

01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:21.600
they'll be

01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:23.920
now i was going to talk about how hard

01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:27.920
this uh... actually monday we have to put my dog down

01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:30.440
all

01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:32.200
yeah

01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:34.200
She's not seven million years old, she was fourteen.

01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:35.200
No.

01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:42.920
No, we had to put my dog to sleep, so we buried her up in Placerville area, up at some lake

01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:46.640
or something, and then between these trees we gave her her blanket, and...

01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:51.800
Stop hitting me with your fucking keys!

01:39:51.800 --> 01:40:00.200
And then we put her, like, bone and stuff in there, so that was kind of sad.

01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:01.200
Alright.

01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:05.200
At least you didn't take pictures like Oolong.

01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:07.200
No, not that I'm aware of.

01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:11.200
Good. I would be wondering about your sanity.

01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:13.200
But I'm sorry about your dog.

01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:15.200
That's alright.

01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:18.200
For me, who doesn't like dogs, I liked your dog.

01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:22.200
She was cool. But she was old and she was in pain, so we decided...

01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:27.200
I mean, she didn't die naturally. We just took her to the vet to have her go to sleep because she was in pain.

01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:40.200
She's been walking, her back legs are going paralyzed, and she had cysts all over the place, and probably cysts on the inside of her, and she was having trouble breathing, and all that wonderful stuff, so we're just like, okay, we're just gonna stay on it.

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:44.200
It was hard having to say goodbye to her, though, before I had to go to work.

01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:45.200
Oh?

01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:47.200
I had to say a final goodbye.

01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:48.200
Sad.

01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:49.200
Okay.

01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:54.200
Well, okay, before we turn, now we've gone from Jerry Springer to Depression Hour.

01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:56.200
Now it's Oprah.

01:40:56.200 --> 01:41:01.100
Okay, but we're gonna play some, we're gonna cool down tempers by playing some mellow

01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:07.540
songs. We're gonna play some mellow things. So, we will be back, and we're gonna play

01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:11.980

Actually, yes, basically, Rob will read off the phrase to you.

01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:43.260

Now Jamie's yelling at me! I can't take it!

Ow, she kicked me!

01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:18.040
I cry. Alright, first question. I'm gonna have my revenge, because Jamie tonight is in two questions.

01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:24.040
Alright, but first we're gonna do a question about Angel.

01:53:24.040 --> 01:53:26.040
Here we go.

01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:28.040
Please don't yell, I have to ask him not to yell.

01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:30.040
Jamie, you have a headache.

01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:32.320
Here we go.

01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:34.080
Where did the music go?

01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:35.640
It went to hell.

01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:36.740
All right, here we go.

01:53:36.740 --> 01:53:39.840
Angel was very excited to be back from Japan.

01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:42.360
And her buddies in SAKTO were excited to watch

01:53:42.360 --> 01:53:45.480
her carry two big bags of souvenirs through the door

01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:47.240
to her welcome home party.

01:53:47.240 --> 01:53:49.560
But they were all shocked to find that the bags were

01:53:49.560 --> 01:53:50.960
full of nothing but blank.

01:53:55.600 --> 01:53:58.320
Angel was very excited to be back from Japan.

01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:03.040
And her buddies in SACTO were excited to watch her carry two big bags of souvenirs through

01:54:03.040 --> 01:54:04.920
the door to her welcome home party.

01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:17.200
But they were shocked to find that the bags were full of nothing but blank.

01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:23.280
I'm waiting on both contestants to give me an answer.

01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:30.280
Alright, there's one answer locked in. I'm waiting on one more answer. Angel carried

01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:37.320
in two bags full of blankets. Don't give your answers aloud, please. Alright, I think we

01:54:39.420 --> 01:54:44.320
have our other contestant locked in. Jesus Christ, it's going to be one of those days.

01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:51.080
Okay, we have one of those contestants on the show tonight. Alright, yes, I'm just going

01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:53.080
I have to warn you all, we have one of those contestants.

01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:55.080
Okay, everybody locked in in the room.

01:54:55.080 --> 01:54:57.080
Yes, okay, here we go.

01:54:57.080 --> 01:55:00.080
Should I read the contestants first, or us first?

01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:01.080
Contestants first, okay.

01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:06.080
Snupdisphonoid says, Angel was excited to be back from Japan.

01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:11.080
Her buddies in Sato were excited to watch her carry two big bags of souvenirs through the door to her welcome home party.

01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:17.080
But, they were shocked to find that the bags were full of nothing but dead babies covered in feces.

01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:20.080
Ew!

01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:24.840
Shame on you, Angel! What about the babies?

01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:28.880
SkylineDC505 says

01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:32.240
two bags full of nothing but pakari sweat.

01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:36.440
I got pakari sweat. Which is kind of ironic because in reality, yeah,

01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:40.680
she did bring a little pakari sweat.

01:55:40.680 --> 01:55:44.600
I have my answer. Alright, let's go around the room and see if we have any matches. Jamie,

01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:47.720
what was your answer? Two bags full of nothing but

01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:53.600
uh... metal collars tickets to deserted island metal collars and tickets to a

01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:56.820
deserted island i'm sorry it's not a match

01:55:56.820 --> 01:56:03.820
all right moving on angel and maggots what did you guys come up with

01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:07.040

Propel!

01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:11.220
very close but not a match

01:56:11.220 --> 01:56:13.340
not a match sorry puppy

01:56:13.340 --> 01:56:14.700
two bags full of

01:56:14.700 --> 01:56:28.100
Yowie. Yowie! No, I'm sorry. Uh, Loki, two bags full of? Iraqi suicide bombers. I don't

01:56:28.100 --> 01:56:32.940
even know where you can find those in Japan, but whatever. Okay, zero. They're out there.

01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:39.660
Get them out of vending machines. Zero. They're imported. Um, unlucky and super lucky weapons

01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:41.660
to distribute randomly.

01:56:41.660 --> 01:56:43.660
Unlucky and super lucky weapons to distribute randomly.

01:56:43.660 --> 01:56:44.660
No, I'm sorry.

01:56:44.660 --> 01:56:46.660
See, I was going to say the same thing of Jamie,

01:56:46.660 --> 01:56:49.660
but I knew that she was going to say something about Royale Real.

01:56:49.660 --> 01:56:51.660
So I went with the other great import.

01:56:51.660 --> 01:56:56.660
A bag full of Chairman Kaga's uniform from Iron Chef.

01:56:56.660 --> 01:56:57.660
Iron Chef uniform.

01:56:57.660 --> 01:56:58.160
All right.

01:56:58.160 --> 01:56:59.660
Let's put used underwear.

01:56:59.660 --> 01:57:01.160
I was going to say soiled panties,

01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:04.660
but then I thought some people might take that the wrong way.

01:57:04.660 --> 01:57:16.660
My answer is she brought in two bags full of hentai. Sorry. Not a match. Sorry. All right. So the scores...

01:57:16.660 --> 01:57:33.660
The scores... That is awful. I am so glad that it got picked up on the mic. Oh my God. I never said they were adults. They could be babies.

01:58:03.660 --> 01:58:06.860
because all three of us are getting very irritated at

01:58:06.860 --> 01:58:10.640
the shitty service provided to Saturday money dot com by the incompetent web

01:58:10.640 --> 01:58:13.260
hosts at one dollar hosting dot com

01:58:13.260 --> 01:58:20.260
they decided to mail them a nice big box full of blank

01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:25.660
the three folks that run sack the money dot com were getting very irritated

01:58:25.660 --> 01:58:28.780
by the incompetent web host at one dollar hosting dot com

01:58:28.780 --> 01:58:35.780
they decided to mail them a nice big box full of blank.

01:58:35.780 --> 01:59:03.780
I'm going to mail him a nice, big box full of blank.

01:59:03.780 --> 01:59:15.460
I think we're going to do that, too.

01:59:15.460 --> 01:59:19.700
You're going to get a point just for that answer.

01:59:19.700 --> 01:59:20.940
Is everybody locked in in the room?

01:59:20.940 --> 01:59:22.340
All right, here we go.

01:59:22.340 --> 01:59:26.740
The three folks that run sacbomani.com were getting very irritated by the incompetent

01:59:26.740 --> 01:59:28.700
web host at $1hosting.com.

01:59:28.700 --> 01:59:35.700
decided to mail them a nice big box full of. SkylineDC505 says, AOL CDs.

01:59:35.700 --> 01:59:40.060
Brilliant. Brilliant. Here's another brilliant one. This is the one I was laughing at. Snubdicinoid

01:59:40.060 --> 01:59:47.060
says, shitty magazines from March Madness. We had a big box of old video game magazines

01:59:48.780 --> 01:59:52.260
you were giving away. It's a great answer. It's fucking genius. All right, let's see

01:59:52.260 --> 01:59:56.100
if there are any matches. Here we go, Jamie.

01:59:56.100 --> 02:00:03.100
I would send them in a box, the severed heads belonging to their head tech with a grenade in his mouth.

02:00:12.100 --> 02:00:13.100
Poopy!

02:00:13.100 --> 02:00:29.780

p0k3smot42o

02:00:54.540 --> 02:00:59.540
Zero, a nice big box full of stinky shit and jizz.

02:00:59.540 --> 02:01:02.540
Stinky shit and jizz, lovely.

02:01:02.540 --> 02:01:03.540

02:01:03.540 --> 02:01:04.540
Brand name of choice.

02:01:04.540 --> 02:01:05.540
The brand name of choice.

02:01:05.540 --> 02:01:06.540
Tell.

02:01:06.540 --> 02:01:10.540
Actually, I was just thinking, you know, we should be nice to them.

02:01:10.540 --> 02:01:11.540
They're friendly people.

02:01:11.540 --> 02:01:13.540
They host our site on occasion.

02:01:13.540 --> 02:01:21.540
And so I'm thinking, you know, a nice box full of cyanide-laced cupcakes.

02:01:21.540 --> 02:01:22.540
Cyanide-laced cupcakes.

02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:23.540
Beautiful.

02:07:04.660 --> 02:07:07.580
the march madness tournament in sacramento is such a great success with

02:07:07.580 --> 02:07:09.680
a special message to all those of you

02:07:09.680 --> 02:07:16.680
that came out and participated. Next time, please don't make us clean up your blank.

02:07:39.680 --> 02:07:42.680
All right.

02:07:42.680 --> 02:07:49.680
Very simple answer, locked in.

02:07:49.680 --> 02:07:52.680
Waiting on one more. Waiting on one more contestant.

02:07:52.680 --> 02:07:55.680
Next time, please don't make us clean up your blank.

02:07:55.680 --> 02:07:56.680
Mm, tastes like Korea.

02:07:56.680 --> 02:07:59.680
Are all the contestants, are all the celebrities locked in?

02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:04.680
Yes. Yeah? Oh, puppy's almost done.

02:08:04.680 --> 02:08:06.680
Okay.

02:08:06.680 --> 02:08:08.680
Puppy, you in?

02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:14.680
He's writing, he's writing, he's writing, writing, writing, still writing, writing.

02:08:14.680 --> 02:08:20.680
And, and, and he is almost done.

02:08:20.680 --> 02:08:23.680
He's done. All right, there he goes. Put it down. All right.

02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:25.680
Wait, did they send new answers?

02:08:25.680 --> 02:08:26.680
Okay, fine.

02:08:26.680 --> 02:08:27.680
Okay, here we go.

02:08:27.680 --> 02:08:28.680
The contestants said,

02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:30.680
The March Madness Tournament in Sacramento was such a great success,

02:08:30.680 --> 02:08:33.680
but a special message to all those of you that came out and participated.

02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:36.680
Next time, please don't make us clean up your snub.

02:08:36.680 --> 02:08:39.420
This noise says, poop.

02:08:39.420 --> 02:08:42.020
Please don't make us clean up your poop.

02:08:42.020 --> 02:08:44.700
Skyline says, please don't make us clean up your crap.

02:08:47.660 --> 02:08:50.980
Now, there is a difference between crap and poop.

02:08:50.980 --> 02:08:52.220
Crap could be anything.

02:08:52.220 --> 02:08:54.420
Crap could actually mean crap, or crap

02:08:54.420 --> 02:08:56.660
could mean your stuff that you left running around.

02:08:56.660 --> 02:08:58.140
Poop is pretty narrow.

02:08:58.140 --> 02:09:01.420
There's only one thing that could be considered poop.

02:09:01.420 --> 02:09:02.100
It depends.

02:09:02.100 --> 02:09:04.260
Well, there's several animals that could have pooped.

02:09:04.260 --> 02:09:05.700
But poop is poop.

02:09:05.700 --> 02:09:09.980
crap could be poop, plus several other things, so I think Skyline has the edge on this, but

02:09:09.980 --> 02:09:16.960
we'll see, we'll see. Let's go around and see the answers. Jamie, please next time,

02:09:16.960 --> 02:09:20.280
don't make us clean up your... Blood from their jugular veins is their college

02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:45.040
p0k3smot42o

02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:22.040
I said, don't make us clean up your shitty shorts after the judges review a new one.

02:10:22.040 --> 02:10:25.040
Shitty shorts after the judges review a new one. Isn't that lovely?

02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:29.040
Lo and behold, will this be my answer? Don't make us clean up your crap.

02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:38.040
Don't make us clean up your crap. You said crap. That is an exact match. An exact match with Skyline. Beautiful.

02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:42.040
Now it's 2-0. Well, let's see if Snub Distantly can catch up here.

02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:48.040
I said, please don't make us clean up your sweat.

02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:54.040
Because you guys sweat a lot when you play DDR and you need to wear deodorant. Okay.

02:10:54.040 --> 02:10:56.040
Alright.

02:10:56.040 --> 02:11:00.040
So, two points for Skyline and no points for Snub.

02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:04.040
But that's okay, Snub. Here's your chance. Here is your chance to catch up.

02:11:04.040 --> 02:11:08.040
And you've been bitching about the Battle Royale references all night long.

02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:10.540
Well, here you go. This last question is just for you to catch up.

02:11:10.540 --> 02:11:12.040
Okay, here we go.

02:11:12.040 --> 02:11:15.040
Jamie, I promised two questions about Jamie.

02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:19.040
Jamie won the Bimani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night.

02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:21.040
Her secret weapon was her blank.

02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:38.040
Jamie won the Bamani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night.

02:11:39.040 --> 02:11:41.040
Her secret weapon was her blank.

02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:49.800
Snub, this is your last chance to catch up. Make it good.

02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:57.320
Alright, we have one contestant locked in. Ooh, excellent answer, excellent, excellent

02:11:57.320 --> 02:12:02.480
answer from that contestant. Too bad we're not as smart as the contestants.

02:12:02.480 --> 02:12:09.480

02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:16.480

02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:33.200
I was just letting you know what you said.

02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:52.200
I hate you just this once.

02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:54.200
You just work like that much.

02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:56.200
I hate you so much.

02:12:56.200 --> 02:12:57.200
Oh, that hurt!

02:12:57.200 --> 02:12:57.700
Meanie.

02:12:57.700 --> 02:12:58.700
Alright, here we go, here we go.

02:13:02.700 --> 02:13:04.200
Contestants, here we go.

02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:06.200
Snub's gotta catch up, and here's his answer.

02:13:06.200 --> 02:13:09.200
Jamie won the Bamani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night.

02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:12.700
Her secret weapon was her remote collar exploder dealie.

02:13:13.700 --> 02:13:14.700
Good answer.

02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:16.200
Okay.

02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:20.700
Jamie won the Bamani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night.

02:13:20.700 --> 02:13:22.200
Her secret weapon was her,

02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:23.700
Skyline says,

02:13:23.700 --> 02:13:30.780
Oh, he changed his answer. I think his first answer was better. He said orange bat, which

02:13:30.780 --> 02:13:38.340
is a great answer, but he changed it. His new answer is boom stick. So we have remote

02:13:38.340 --> 02:13:43.300
collar, exploder, dealie, and boom stick. Alright, Jamie, what's your answer?

02:13:43.300 --> 02:13:49.220
Orange bat. Orange bat. I knew it too. That's right. You're

02:13:49.220 --> 02:13:54.220
already in the lead, Skyline, you don't need it. Alright, as Snub goes, yes, I still have

02:13:54.220 --> 02:13:59.540
a chance. Okay, our tag team, lovely tag team of Magus and Angel. Big black cock. Her big

02:13:59.540 --> 02:14:09.540
black cock. Dun, dun, dun! Sorry, that's not a match. But funny, Puppy. The ferret! The

02:14:09.540 --> 02:14:15.540
Good answer, but not a match.

02:14:15.540 --> 02:14:20.540
Loki, her secret weapon was her...

02:14:20.540 --> 02:14:25.540
Iraqi suicide babies.

02:14:25.540 --> 02:14:27.540
Iraqi suicide babies.

02:14:27.540 --> 02:14:29.540
Jamie, is this true?

02:14:29.540 --> 02:14:32.540
I admit it, I've been exporting them.

02:14:32.540 --> 02:14:36.540
I keep them in my trunk.

02:14:36.540 --> 02:14:40.540
Alright, in your trunks. Dear God, what about the children? What about the children? Alright, moving on.

02:14:40.540 --> 02:14:44.540
Uh, zero! Her paper plate. Her paper plate! The real answer!

02:14:44.540 --> 02:14:48.540
The true one! And the magic marker.

02:14:48.540 --> 02:14:52.540
Alright.

02:14:52.540 --> 02:14:56.540
And the damn candlestick she jabbed me in the head with.

02:14:56.540 --> 02:15:00.540
Alright. In the study with Colonel Mustard.

02:15:00.540 --> 02:15:04.540
Here we go. Um, Dave, who's filling in for Shiva.

02:15:04.540 --> 02:15:08.540
Yeah, her secret weapon was her extremely high-pitched voice.

02:15:10.540 --> 02:15:11.540
No!

02:15:11.540 --> 02:15:12.540
My carrot!

02:15:12.540 --> 02:15:13.540
Ahh!

02:15:13.540 --> 02:15:14.540
Ahh!

02:15:14.540 --> 02:15:15.540
Ahh!

02:15:15.540 --> 02:15:16.540
Ahh!

02:15:16.540 --> 02:15:17.540
Ahh!

02:15:17.540 --> 02:15:20.540
Shatter, shatter, shatter.

02:15:20.540 --> 02:15:21.540
I'm surprised.

02:15:21.540 --> 02:15:23.540
That reminds me of a story you told me earlier this week,

02:15:23.540 --> 02:15:26.540
and I'm surprised it was not your nephew of the week.

02:15:26.540 --> 02:15:27.540
You bitch!

02:15:27.540 --> 02:15:28.540
All right.

02:15:28.540 --> 02:15:32.540
Anyway, my answer, yeah, I got carrot.

02:15:32.540 --> 02:15:36.540
For the record, Jamie does sound like a younger person on the phone.

02:15:36.540 --> 02:15:41.540
Okay, fuck you. I have to get to that. I have to do another fuck you after this.

02:15:41.540 --> 02:15:43.540
After the break.

02:15:48.540 --> 02:15:53.540
But you know what? It just goes to show that looks can be deceiving.

02:15:53.540 --> 02:15:56.540
Because she's pure evil.

02:15:56.540 --> 02:15:59.540
Alright, my answer. Let's finish this damn thing up.

02:15:59.540 --> 02:16:06.540
Only three people are going to get this joke, but I said Jamie won because of her cocksnacks.

02:16:09.900 --> 02:16:16.900
Cocksnacks. Alright. Skyline, two points. Snub, zero points. Skyline

02:16:17.740 --> 02:16:23.740
is the winner! Yay! And what does Skyline win, Jamie?

02:16:23.740 --> 02:16:51.020

Those who don't know.

02:17:54.100 --> 02:17:58.100
If you want to get rid of a telemarketer, ask them to help you out.

02:17:58.100 --> 02:18:00.100
That was Story Time with Jamie, everybody.

02:18:00.100 --> 02:18:01.100
Yay!

02:18:01.100 --> 02:18:06.100
Normally, I'm really not that bad with telemarketers because, you know, Dan had to do that for

02:18:06.100 --> 02:18:07.100
a little while.

02:18:07.100 --> 02:18:08.100
Uh-huh.

02:18:08.100 --> 02:18:12.100
And I'm really, I'm really patient with them usually, but that is my number one pet peeve

02:18:12.100 --> 02:18:13.100
as people tell him.

02:18:13.100 --> 02:18:14.100
You remember in Undersedation?

02:18:14.100 --> 02:18:15.100
Mm-hmm.

02:18:15.100 --> 02:18:16.100
Dude, all of you.

02:18:16.100 --> 02:18:19.100
So you get to fuck YouTube, but not recently.

02:18:19.100 --> 02:18:20.100
Hey, you should have done this to me.

02:18:20.100 --> 02:18:22.100
Oh, hold on just one second.

02:18:22.100 --> 02:18:23.100
Hi.

02:18:23.100 --> 02:18:25.100
Uh, fuck yourself in.

02:18:25.100 --> 02:18:27.100
Okay, I'll put it this way.

02:18:27.100 --> 02:18:29.100
I know you guys hate telemarkers,

02:18:29.100 --> 02:18:32.100
but I remember when I had to do telemarketing,

02:18:32.100 --> 02:18:35.100
we hated more than you guys hate us having to do it.

02:18:35.100 --> 02:18:38.100
It's totally tedious work, and it's stupid,

02:18:38.100 --> 02:18:40.100
and people hate you because you have to call them

02:18:40.100 --> 02:18:45.100
without your job, and it really sucks us.

02:18:45.100 --> 02:18:46.100
He was rude, though.

02:18:46.100 --> 02:18:47.100
Yeah.

02:18:47.100 --> 02:18:52.100
Well, yeah, it was just like, you know, like, we hate doing it more than you guys hate us

02:18:52.100 --> 02:18:54.860
calling you at six o'clock right when you're in the middle of dinner.

02:18:54.860 --> 02:18:58.860
Like, the best time is when you're calling when people are saying grace for dinner, because

02:18:58.860 --> 02:19:01.140
you'll hear Jesus Christ come out of their mouth.

02:19:01.140 --> 02:19:03.300
It's the best thing ever.

02:19:03.300 --> 02:19:04.300
No.

02:19:04.300 --> 02:19:07.260
Or after they're done watching the ring.

02:19:07.260 --> 02:19:11.140
Normally, like I said, I'm fine with telemarketers.

02:19:11.140 --> 02:19:14.020
I'm normally, you know, just fine as I can be with them.

02:19:14.020 --> 02:19:18.020
I don't sound like I'm twelve. I don't know how I sound like I'm twelve.

02:19:18.020 --> 02:19:22.020
Even when I'm happy. Do I sound like I'm twelve when I'm happy?

02:19:22.020 --> 02:19:24.020
Shut up, Robin.

02:19:24.020 --> 02:19:27.020
I didn't say a goddamn thing. I'm just looking at you.

02:19:27.020 --> 02:19:30.020
I'm gonna go now. I have to go back.

02:19:30.020 --> 02:19:34.020
Jamie's gonna go make a gift, and in the meantime, we're gonna play some gifts for you.

02:19:34.020 --> 02:19:37.020
When we come back, we're gonna talk to Jonas.

02:19:37.020 --> 02:19:39.020
Because Jonas is here. Say hi, Jonas.

02:19:39.020 --> 02:19:41.020
What up, yo?

02:19:41.020 --> 02:19:45.820
And I think, Jamie, how about some Ask Orange Lounge, what do you think?

02:19:45.820 --> 02:19:47.140
Why not?

02:19:47.140 --> 02:19:50.180
I did not have that light switch installed so you could have a light switch rave.

02:19:50.180 --> 02:19:52.180
Light switch rave!

02:19:52.180 --> 02:19:59.980
When we come back, Ask Orange Lounge, and there's lots of people to ask tonight.

02:19:59.980 --> 02:20:06.660
You can ask Sky, you can ask Loki, you can ask Dark Sakura, or you can ask DDR Angel,

02:20:06.660 --> 02:20:08.380
Who's back from Japan?

02:20:08.380 --> 02:20:15.620
You can ask 23rd Magus and DDR Angel if you are so inclined to ask a personal question.

02:20:15.620 --> 02:20:22.460
Ask Puppy, ask Dark Tetsuya about what the rest of the routine would have been if those

02:20:22.460 --> 02:20:25.680
fuckers hadn't pulled him off stage.

02:20:25.680 --> 02:20:29.500
Ask Xerox about how much he hates that name.

02:20:29.500 --> 02:20:32.460
Or you can ask Jonas about what he's going to be doing at Power Station.

02:20:32.460 --> 02:20:34.460
Way to go, way to go.

02:20:34.460 --> 02:20:36.460
There's a lot of frustration all the way.

02:20:36.460 --> 02:20:40.920

02:25:30.480 --> 02:25:30.980
Ha!

02:25:30.980 --> 02:25:59.980
All you men are randoms, and you're just that. Random. Bye.

02:25:59.980 --> 02:26:00.980
Hi.

02:26:00.980 --> 02:26:02.980
Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio, where...

02:26:02.980 --> 02:26:04.980
What was orange?

02:26:04.980 --> 02:26:06.980
Shaving monkeys is always permitted.

02:26:06.980 --> 02:26:07.980
Just kidding.

02:26:07.980 --> 02:26:08.980
But...

02:26:08.980 --> 02:26:09.980
What is...

02:26:09.980 --> 02:26:12.980
Can I get some fun until it poos on your face?

02:26:12.980 --> 02:26:14.980
You scare the monkey, you don't come in.

02:26:17.980 --> 02:26:19.980
No, no, no. I'll just bring Shermy.

02:26:21.980 --> 02:26:23.980
If Shermy doesn't like you, leave.

02:26:23.980 --> 02:26:27.980
Proceeding, as always, was brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.

02:26:53.980 --> 02:26:55.980
p0k3smot42o 1 less person i have to take home bye

02:27:23.980 --> 02:27:29.060
can ask her about something she saw there. You can ask Angel and Megas personal questions.

02:27:29.060 --> 02:27:34.500
You can ask Joe about his routine. You can ask Loki about why he's such a bastard. You

02:27:34.500 --> 02:27:41.500
can ask Zero about Xerox or whatever. You can ask Anita about being cute.

02:27:45.940 --> 02:27:51.900
I'd like to comment on her quote yesterday in the chatroom. It rules. You can read that

02:27:51.900 --> 02:27:58.620
off by the way the quote was bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity also

02:27:58.620 --> 02:28:01.140
I want to say hello to Jonas let's talk to Jonas for a bit while people are

02:28:01.140 --> 02:28:04.820
submitting questions give it a minute Jonas how you doing okay we didn't get

02:28:04.820 --> 02:28:06.980
to talk to you about the tournament how did how did you feel about it

02:28:06.980 --> 02:28:11.580
March Madness first of all first of all I thought this was like the best term

02:28:11.580 --> 02:28:20.140
I've ever been everything was all set up right especially for PA though some

02:28:20.140 --> 02:28:25.140
Some people were complaining about having a 10-footer as like, do you know what he said

02:28:25.140 --> 02:28:26.140
in his song?

02:28:26.140 --> 02:28:27.140
Yep.

02:28:27.140 --> 02:28:31.140
I think some people were complaining about putting naked no 10-footers.

02:28:31.140 --> 02:28:34.140
The score was like the easiest 10-footer of all time.

02:28:34.140 --> 02:28:39.140
You know what's interesting though is that the way Mike seeded is he didn't seed it just

02:28:39.140 --> 02:28:40.140
by score.

02:28:40.140 --> 02:28:44.140
Some people that screwed up their combos on bag and stuff got seeded lower.

02:28:44.140 --> 02:28:48.140
If they got more than like 50 grades, he threw them in the bottom saying, you know what,

02:28:48.140 --> 02:28:50.140
know what, don't do that shit, which is pretty cool.

02:29:18.140 --> 02:29:20.140
How the fuck am I the upset king if I keep winning?

02:29:22.540 --> 02:29:26.200
No, I'm just kidding I don't have an ego like that I I honestly eat both times

02:29:26.720 --> 02:29:29.220
Both times was a huge surprise. There's a huge surprise

02:29:36.460 --> 02:29:40.760
Oh, yes, my alter ego dr. Dick I know who I am. I know who I am

02:29:40.760 --> 02:29:43.700
Do you know why the video is going to embarrass my mother?

02:29:43.700 --> 02:29:46.800
That's obviously the video of the actual freestyle routine is out

02:29:46.800 --> 02:29:52.880
But don't waste your time downloading it it sucks wait for the whole thing wait for the official videos that are gonna

02:29:52.880 --> 02:29:59.160
Have the whole thing the introduction and the follow-up because the routine itself sucks shit although as I found out

02:29:59.600 --> 02:30:03.380
Just moments ago. I came in seventh place dr. D

02:30:03.380 --> 02:30:08.520
I should say dr. Dick came in seventh place which means if one of the top six flakes

02:30:09.080 --> 02:30:11.680
I'm going to power station, and I have to do a freestyle

02:30:11.680 --> 02:30:16.680
But we'll find out what your song is somehow.

02:30:16.680 --> 02:30:21.680
And of course you may not want to improv it because this is an actual power station.

02:30:21.680 --> 02:30:26.680
Now this is interesting though, is because does Dr. Dick have to do it, or can I do it?

02:30:26.680 --> 02:30:28.680
That's the other question, do I have to do it as Dr. Dick?

02:30:28.680 --> 02:30:32.680
Well I could be a two-faced person and say half-sky.

02:30:32.680 --> 02:30:37.680
I don't know, I'm going to have to think about that. That's going to be kind of hard to...

02:30:37.680 --> 02:30:39.680
Okay, half spanky, half dick.

02:31:07.680 --> 02:31:12.200
to give a shout out to their tournament. I'm sure they did a fabulous DDR Magic 5. I've

02:31:12.200 --> 02:31:17.520
got some results. They had a tech category and I'm sure it was insane. First place, GPF

02:31:17.520 --> 02:31:23.280
Lift, surprise. Second place, Dancing Jedi. He's like the Tigger up there. You know he

02:31:23.280 --> 02:31:27.360
wins the tournament. Oh, surprise. So that's why, ooh, if he comes to B3, which I hear

02:31:27.360 --> 02:31:33.920
he is, it's going to be a great showdown. That's going to be beautiful. Oh, I'll wet

02:31:33.920 --> 02:31:38.000
my pants all right third was unblinking eyes so congratulations top three in

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:43.760
tech there Oni first place was dancing Jedi second place was GPF lift and third

02:31:43.760 --> 02:31:47.480
place was cynic good job you guys challenge now this is cool I am

02:31:47.480 --> 02:31:50.520
surprised that the challenge competition has never been ripped off here in nor

02:31:50.520 --> 02:31:55.640
Caleb just wait maybe maybe we'll rip that off the next actor but they do like

02:31:55.640 --> 02:31:58.440
if you remember challenge from fourth makes an extra mix they do a competition

02:31:58.440 --> 02:32:02.680
that's all like about that like how many goods can you get on this song or how

02:32:02.680 --> 02:32:06.420
How many perfects can you get not looking at it or whatever, like all this crazy stuff

02:32:06.420 --> 02:32:07.420
they do?

02:32:07.420 --> 02:32:08.540
Oh yeah.

02:32:08.540 --> 02:32:11.380
And it's interesting, but this is interesting because the Seattle tournaments, they're all

02:32:11.380 --> 02:32:15.620
PA, there's no freestyle, because I guess they can't freestyle or whatever, I don't

02:32:15.620 --> 02:32:16.620
know.

02:32:16.620 --> 02:32:17.620
You never know.

02:32:17.620 --> 02:32:20.120
They're going to prove us wrong at B3, I bet you anything, they're going to all put their

02:32:20.120 --> 02:32:23.280
heads together and just give this kick-ass freestyle, they'll just put everything else

02:32:23.280 --> 02:32:24.280
to shame.

02:32:24.280 --> 02:32:29.080
You got people around the U.S. freestyling hella good, and they'll be from Omaha, they

02:32:29.080 --> 02:32:33.080
from New York. Hell, it can happen.

02:32:33.080 --> 02:32:36.080
First place in challenge was Krakoon.

02:32:36.080 --> 02:32:37.080
Second place was Dancing Jedi.

02:32:37.080 --> 02:32:39.080
And third place was Sinic.

02:32:39.080 --> 02:32:40.080
Good job, you guys.

02:32:40.080 --> 02:32:42.080
Alright, so that was the DDR Magic Tournament.

02:32:42.080 --> 02:32:44.080
And I guess there was a tournament in Florida, and Tigger won a machine.

02:32:44.080 --> 02:32:45.080
Yes, he did.

02:32:45.080 --> 02:32:47.080
Nobody was paying attention to that tournament, so they don't give a shoutout.

02:32:47.080 --> 02:32:49.080
I thought Tigger wasn't there.

02:32:49.080 --> 02:32:53.080
If somebody can give me information on who plays in that tournament, I'll gladly read their names.

02:32:53.080 --> 02:32:54.080
Okay, get to the Q&A!

02:32:54.080 --> 02:32:56.080
Chat room's demanding we get to the Q&A.

02:32:56.080 --> 02:32:58.080
Yes. Boost your questions, please.

02:32:58.080 --> 02:33:00.080
We start with riceprincess.

02:33:00.080 --> 02:33:05.080
Riceprincess wants to know what is DJ Taka's real name?

02:33:05.080 --> 02:33:07.080
I don't know.

02:33:07.080 --> 02:33:12.080
Actually, if you look in the DVR Max thing, his name is...

02:33:12.080 --> 02:33:16.080
No, get the US DVR Max, it's in there.

02:33:16.080 --> 02:33:21.080
She says she found out already, but we're challenging ourselves now.

02:33:21.080 --> 02:33:26.080
Oh, riceprincess has it, but let's see if Loki can find it.

02:33:26.080 --> 02:33:39.340

02:33:53.720 --> 02:34:04.760
to by Joe thanks for coming

02:34:05.760 --> 02:34:12.040
any final thoughts on your day all right thank you but I bet you didn't know that

02:34:12.040 --> 02:34:18.100
that V was co-opted by DJ Taka and Antonio Vivaldi.

02:34:18.100 --> 02:34:21.860
No, I kid you not, it's in the case notes.

02:34:21.860 --> 02:34:23.940
Seeing as you know, Vivaldi is the classic piece

02:34:23.940 --> 02:34:27.340
that is based off of.

02:34:27.340 --> 02:34:29.980
Vivaldi's Winter?

02:34:29.980 --> 02:34:30.480
Hello.

02:34:35.220 --> 02:34:37.380
All right, all right, all right, here we go.

02:34:37.380 --> 02:34:44.380
I slept with Mr. Brian once. Okay, here we go. Shh.

02:34:44.380 --> 02:34:51.380
RicePrincess says, what is that white slab in my can of beans?

02:34:51.380 --> 02:34:57.380
Pork. Pork. Fat.

02:34:57.380 --> 02:35:02.380
The other white guy. The other white guy. I'm sorry, Zero?

02:35:02.380 --> 02:35:08.380
It was the other guy who played, it was the other white guy who played Let the Beat Hit.

02:35:08.380 --> 02:35:10.380
Sigh.

02:35:10.380 --> 02:35:14.380
Okay. And she's warning us to look forward to Orange Crush in the future.

02:35:14.380 --> 02:35:16.380
She's got some questions.

02:35:16.380 --> 02:35:20.380
Vidpowah! Oh, Vidpowah's question was for DarkTetsuya and he left! Shit!

02:35:20.380 --> 02:35:21.380
I'll answer it!

02:35:21.380 --> 02:35:25.380
Okay, well this was it. It was DarkTetsuya, it was, this was a question from Vidpowah.

02:35:25.380 --> 02:35:28.380
Why are you so awesome and why do you rule so much?

02:35:28.380 --> 02:35:31.380
That's the question!

02:35:31.380 --> 02:35:33.380
Yeah, it's rhetorical.

02:35:33.380 --> 02:35:35.380
He just does.

02:35:35.380 --> 02:35:37.380
Because he's influenced by Dark Sakura.

02:35:37.380 --> 02:35:39.380
Yes, because we're his friends.

02:35:39.380 --> 02:35:41.380
That's why he rules so much. That's the answer.

02:35:41.380 --> 02:35:43.380
He rules so much because we're his friends.

02:35:43.380 --> 02:35:45.380
Alright.

02:35:45.380 --> 02:35:47.380
Snubdismoid says,

02:35:47.380 --> 02:35:53.380
Why, in the name of God, did I have to get two greats on Never Let You Down?

02:35:53.380 --> 02:35:55.380
Because you suck.

02:35:55.380 --> 02:35:57.380
I'm kidding.

02:35:57.380 --> 02:36:03.500
Uh, you got two greats, I'll never let you down because you weren't concentrating, and

02:36:03.500 --> 02:36:05.300
next time your neck gets blown off.

02:36:05.300 --> 02:36:08.940
Because you have to pee, and you can't PA when you have to pee.

02:36:08.940 --> 02:36:15.500
Alright, Snubdicenoid also wants to say to Angel, did you get to ride the, and pardon

02:36:15.500 --> 02:36:20.620
my white pronunciation of this, Shinca, woo, and I burped too, Shincansen, the bullet train,

02:36:20.620 --> 02:36:21.620
did you get to ride the bullet train?

02:36:21.620 --> 02:36:27.260
No, but my father and my friend did, on the way over to where we were.

02:36:27.260 --> 02:36:30.260
That's cool. Did you get to see it? Did you get to hear him honk the horn?

02:36:30.260 --> 02:36:41.260
Uh, no. We have little trains over there. They got to see, like, Hiroshima and, you know, uh, Mount Fuji, you know, all the little sites while they're going down, so...

02:36:41.260 --> 02:36:42.260
Alright.

02:36:42.260 --> 02:36:47.260
Except it took them, like, ten hours to get to where we were, so, yeah.

02:36:47.260 --> 02:36:55.260
Alright. Oh, and Snubdissonoid says, you know what? Hey, Jamie, you know what? Snubdissonoid, he did have to pee. Amazing.

02:36:55.260 --> 02:37:01.860
miss Cleo live in the house all right Justin would like to say how many people

02:37:01.860 --> 02:37:05.020

02:37:22.220 --> 02:37:24.220
You've seen Ren and Stimpy?

02:37:24.220 --> 02:37:26.220
Of course!

02:37:26.220 --> 02:37:28.220
There must have been a reference I missed.

02:37:28.220 --> 02:37:30.220
It's all about the brand new episodes on TNN.

02:37:30.220 --> 02:37:32.220
It's all about the brand new episodes on TNN.

02:37:32.220 --> 02:37:36.220
Yes, that's right, they bought the rights for it and they're making new episodes.

02:37:36.220 --> 02:37:38.220
This is amazing.

02:37:38.220 --> 02:37:42.220
For the first time in my life, I watched SpongeBob SquarePants.

02:37:42.220 --> 02:37:44.220
Never seen it, never will.

02:37:44.220 --> 02:37:46.220
It's pretty fucking funny. I think you're missing out.

02:37:46.220 --> 02:37:48.220
It's pretty funny. I was impressed.

02:37:48.220 --> 02:37:50.220
Eat me.

02:37:50.220 --> 02:37:53.220
You have got me watching Invader Zim now.

02:37:53.220 --> 02:37:54.220
Oh.

02:37:54.220 --> 02:37:56.220
Well, I've been downloading them.

02:37:56.220 --> 02:38:03.220
RicePrincess says the correct answer to the bean question was,

02:38:03.220 --> 02:38:06.220
it's the queen bean and the rest are worker beans.

02:38:06.220 --> 02:38:08.220
I remember that.

02:38:08.220 --> 02:38:11.220
Okay, that's it. I'm curious.

02:38:11.220 --> 02:38:16.220
Questions for the two of us, please.

02:38:16.220 --> 02:38:17.220
Oh, I'm sorry, what?

02:38:17.220 --> 02:38:18.220
I don't know.

02:38:18.220 --> 02:38:19.220
Next question?

02:38:19.220 --> 02:38:23.220
I'm curious about what they would like to ask us if they want to ask us.

02:38:23.220 --> 02:38:25.220
Well, here we go. I'm moving on. I'm moving on with more questions.

02:38:25.220 --> 02:38:26.220
Cool.

02:38:26.220 --> 02:38:29.220
Yo, SFBB, do you carry a pen with you everywhere?

02:38:29.220 --> 02:38:30.220
No.

02:38:30.220 --> 02:38:31.220
No, I don't.

02:38:31.220 --> 02:38:32.220
I do.

02:38:32.220 --> 02:38:35.220
I don't need to. I always borrow my pen from Jamie.

02:38:35.220 --> 02:38:37.220
My pen is also a glow stick.

02:38:37.220 --> 02:38:39.220
Oh, dear.

02:38:39.220 --> 02:38:42.220
I carry the penis, my dear.

02:38:42.220 --> 02:38:45.220
Because the penis, my dear.

02:38:45.220 --> 02:38:58.460
I like to be the first on the show to say that I outright boycott any more Battle Royale

02:38:58.460 --> 02:39:02.580
references in the show.

02:39:02.580 --> 02:39:08.900
It was funny, no it wasn't even funny the first time, I let it slide because it was

02:39:08.900 --> 02:39:09.900
kind of cute.

02:39:09.900 --> 02:39:15.020
Second time was slightly less cute but still cute nonetheless, kind of funny, a few different

02:39:15.020 --> 02:39:19.580
references are cute. It's done. You killed the joke.

02:39:19.580 --> 02:39:23.580
If you have any questions about Battle Royale, ask the dictionaries. Jamie and I.

02:39:23.580 --> 02:39:30.100
VidPowah. Second question from VidPowah. I'm so confused. What exactly is this Bimani Battle

02:39:30.100 --> 02:39:33.140
Royale that you keep talking about?

02:39:33.140 --> 02:39:39.900
Battle Royale is a movie. Go to battleroyalonline.com and it's the best movie ever.

02:39:39.900 --> 02:39:43.140
And imagine a bunch of us just flipping around the livery room throwing paper plates at each

02:39:43.140 --> 02:39:46.240
each other, stabbing each other with candles in the eye.

02:39:46.240 --> 02:39:47.440
Sorry, I didn't hit you in the eye.

02:39:47.440 --> 02:39:50.440
I can break this down very easily.

02:39:50.440 --> 02:39:52.440
What happens when a bunch of six-year-olds

02:39:52.440 --> 02:39:53.680
watch the Power Rangers?

02:39:53.680 --> 02:39:54.780
What happens after that?

02:39:54.780 --> 02:39:56.700
They all pretend that they are Power Rangers.

02:39:56.700 --> 02:39:59.120
And they pretend, you know, I'm the red one, I'm the pink one.

02:39:59.120 --> 02:40:00.700
And they beat each other up, you know, pretend.

02:40:00.700 --> 02:40:02.620
And then they pretend that they're transforming

02:40:02.620 --> 02:40:04.620
and stuff like that.

02:40:04.620 --> 02:40:05.660
Shut up, Dave.

02:40:05.660 --> 02:40:07.380
Anyway, that's what happened.

02:40:07.380 --> 02:40:08.500
We watched Battle Royale.

02:40:08.500 --> 02:40:10.040
And then suddenly a bunch of six-year-olds

02:40:10.040 --> 02:40:12.340
were running around my living room playing Battle Royale,

02:40:12.340 --> 02:40:18.420
cutting each other with paper plates, strangling each other with tape. It was beautiful. And

02:40:18.420 --> 02:40:19.820
that was the Bomani Battle Royale.

02:40:19.820 --> 02:40:26.220
And that's when I got knee-dropped into Rob's coffee table by zero.

02:40:26.220 --> 02:40:27.220
Nothing will uh...

02:40:27.220 --> 02:40:30.820
Actually I pushed her and she just kind of fell, but I didn't knee-drop her, she knee-dropped

02:40:30.820 --> 02:40:31.820
herself.

02:40:31.820 --> 02:40:38.500
I think the greatest fuck-up all day was Loki doing a caution drop on Max, too.

02:40:38.500 --> 02:40:42.760
one that wasn't a caution drop in number two I had actually put the freeze there

02:40:42.760 --> 02:40:47.040
for that purpose but the problem is is pulling the freeze in the back of your

02:40:47.040 --> 02:40:50.920
hands when you do like a drop like that you can't hold it down so there's not

02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:54.920
enough weight you can't get your like torso up high enough so that all your

02:40:54.920 --> 02:41:00.320
weights on your hands I should have that knee drop but yeah I couldn't get back

02:41:00.320 --> 02:41:05.320
up because I'm fat I want to see someone hold two freeze arrows on the diagonals

02:41:05.320 --> 02:41:10.000
with each of their asscheeks. Just have like one on the left and one on the right and be

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:24.000
able to hold it. As Rob looks at me and his eyebrow twitches. Alright, let's move on.

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:30.320
Snubdistanoid says, Does anyone in the studio have a Gameboy Advance SP? I got one and safe

02:41:30.320 --> 02:41:35.080
to say, it rocks my cocks. First of all, those things hurt my hand, and I have an afterburner

02:41:35.080 --> 02:41:41.080
in my GBA, so I own you. Uh, I want an afterburner in my GBA, I don't need a Gameboy SP if I

02:41:41.080 --> 02:41:54.080
get an afterburner. Does anybody have one? Nope. Question, he has more than one? I read

02:41:54.080 --> 02:42:01.080
bit wrong, but cock doesn't rhyme with rocks. So I had to say cocks, it's just natural.

02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:06.080
Okay, uh, one of our chatroom frequenters, if you ever run into him, his name is BigRedPimp.

02:42:06.080 --> 02:42:12.080
Um, he does have an SP, so if you want, like, you know, info on it, just ask him.

02:42:12.080 --> 02:42:16.080
No, see? See, wait, wait, hold on. Let me just say it. Court.

02:42:16.080 --> 02:42:19.080
There's a person in here whose fiance works for GameStop, hello.

02:42:19.080 --> 02:42:21.080
No, okay.

02:42:21.080 --> 02:42:23.080
I'm bad Jamie. I'm bad Jamie.

02:42:23.080 --> 02:42:25.080
I'm bad Jamie.

02:42:25.080 --> 02:42:27.080
Hold on, let me speak. Zero.

02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:29.080
Go ahead.

02:42:29.080 --> 02:42:34.080
Let me just say that Corey probably bought one, and he probably got two others just from getting them.

02:42:34.080 --> 02:42:41.080
Okay, the SP is like the worst idea ever. I mean, it's cool that it's compact, but it does hurt your hands.

02:42:41.080 --> 02:42:45.080
And if you have big hands, that's just gonna hurt you too.

02:42:45.080 --> 02:42:50.080
And it just looks kinda cool, but stupid at the same time.

02:42:50.080 --> 02:42:54.800
shoulder buttons are the most retarded I know they're like in the crease of the

02:42:54.800 --> 02:42:59.320
screen it's a that's going on my video game review oh yeah but check it out I

02:42:59.320 --> 02:43:09.000
know how small the GBA is GBA SP but look you can play with one hand like

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:13.240
squeezing a book you look like you're squeezing a boob

02:43:13.240 --> 02:43:18.240
Or rocking your own cocks.

02:43:18.240 --> 02:43:23.240
I am good at it.

02:43:23.240 --> 02:43:28.240
The only game that does not work on SP is Kirby's Tilt and Tumble.

02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:33.240
Because you have to rock the Game Boy.

02:43:33.240 --> 02:43:38.240
And of course, up equals down, left equals right if you play the game.

02:43:38.240 --> 02:43:50.240
just do yourself a favor, get a used GBA and get an afterburner

02:43:50.240 --> 02:43:58.240
these people that are buying these SPs are the same people that bought the Gameboy, then the Gameboy Pocket, then the Gameboy Color, then the Gameboy Advance, then all the SPs

02:43:58.240 --> 02:44:02.240
you stupid bastards, do you realize they just milked five systems out of you?

02:44:02.240 --> 02:44:08.720
Haha, I laugh at you ass. I've only bought the Gameboy and now I'm going to buy the SP

02:44:09.880 --> 02:44:13.060
SP customers are the ones who bought virtual boys and enjoyed them

02:44:13.060 --> 02:44:16.260
I bought a virtual boy and enjoyed it and I don't have an SP

02:44:16.880 --> 02:44:21.180
We got a virtual boy when Hollywood was clearing them out. So we have like the nice plastic case

02:44:22.800 --> 02:44:27.480
No, actually to be perfectly honest when the game when the Gameboy Pocket came out

02:44:27.520 --> 02:44:31.000
It was a massive improvement over the regular Gameboy because it was clearer

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:37.000
But I love my Game Boy Color, and I still use it for one thing, DDRTV2.

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:38.000
Oh yeah.

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:43.000
No, the ones who bought SPs are probably the same ones who bought game comms.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
Anyway.

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
Okay, I got a game comm for five bucks.

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
When Toys R Us is carrying them out.

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:50.000
Moving on.

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000
I own 42 video games, just console.

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:55.000
Hello.

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:56.000
Okay.

02:44:58.000 --> 02:44:59.000
Justin.

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:03.520
Justin circuit is asking us a bunch of questions here

02:45:03.520 --> 02:45:06.920
okay here we go so I we're just gonna get a show of hands okay

02:45:06.920 --> 02:45:12.120

02:45:12.120 --> 02:45:12.480
hands

02:45:12.480 --> 02:45:19.480
Justin circuit would like to know how many people like jenny rom 4 and a half

02:45:20.040 --> 02:45:23.080

02:45:23.080 --> 02:45:26.600

A pinky. Judy Crystal got a pinky. How many people like Propel? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, wait

02:45:44.520 --> 02:46:02.560

02:46:02.560 --> 02:46:11.560
balls. I thought it was Ramen. Ah! I said balls, help me rob. I wasn't trying to, sorry.

02:46:11.560 --> 02:46:12.860
okay

02:46:12.860 --> 02:46:17.280
a special question for angel

02:46:17.280 --> 02:46:20.520
this comes from shadow

02:46:20.520 --> 02:46:26.520
shadow i hate you no no no ok ask the question do you mind if jen and i come visit for a while

02:46:26.520 --> 02:46:33.060
why'd you have to ask that on air? can we just deal with that somewhere else please?

02:46:33.060 --> 02:46:35.360
and what kinds of things will be on the agenda of

02:46:35.360 --> 02:46:39.020
hmm

02:46:39.020 --> 02:46:41.040
ok

02:46:41.040 --> 02:46:45.960
I am now going to end the fucking music. Oh, I missed... Justin, I missed your last line,

02:46:45.960 --> 02:46:49.120
whatever the last thing is you sent. You asked another question, I accidentally asked that

02:46:49.120 --> 02:46:54.320
and you need to resend it. Okay. Since we're out of questions, does anybody in the room

02:46:54.320 --> 02:47:00.320
have a question for somebody else? Yes. Yes, Dave. I have a question for Rob. Great. Have

02:47:00.320 --> 02:47:05.480
you ever AAA'd a heavy song? Have I ever AAA'd a heavy song? Just this week, I AAA'd La Copa

02:47:05.480 --> 02:47:11.160
Davido, which is my first AAA Heavy on Extreme, I should say, because I did a few on 4th Mix

02:47:11.160 --> 02:47:12.160
back then.

02:47:12.160 --> 02:47:13.160
Oh really?

02:47:13.160 --> 02:47:14.160
Oh, that's cool.

02:47:14.160 --> 02:47:15.160
I have, on the 4th Mix, Superstar.

02:47:15.160 --> 02:47:16.160
Awesome.

02:47:16.160 --> 02:47:21.480
That was like when I played Superstar every game I ever played.

02:47:21.480 --> 02:47:22.480
I remember.

02:47:22.480 --> 02:47:23.480
I have a question.

02:47:23.480 --> 02:47:26.800
Tarim, which of us do you think would win a battle royale?

02:47:26.800 --> 02:47:27.800
Dave.

02:47:27.800 --> 02:47:28.800
Dave.

02:47:28.800 --> 02:47:29.800
Dave.

02:47:29.800 --> 02:47:30.800
Okay, wait.

02:47:30.800 --> 02:47:31.800
Okay.

02:47:31.800 --> 02:47:32.800
I actually have...

02:47:32.800 --> 02:47:33.800
Okay.

02:47:33.800 --> 02:47:37.240
I actually got a bunch of questions just now, so I'm going to go through those.

02:47:37.240 --> 02:47:38.240
Anita.

02:47:38.240 --> 02:47:39.240
Oh, yeah.

02:47:39.240 --> 02:47:40.240
Okay, hold on.

02:47:40.240 --> 02:47:41.240
Let's let Anita ask her question.

02:47:41.240 --> 02:47:42.240
I want to check it out.

02:47:42.240 --> 02:47:43.240
It's not so much a question.

02:47:43.240 --> 02:47:48.800
I have an accomplishment I wanted to announce.

02:47:48.800 --> 02:47:52.800
I passed my first 2DX song with a full combo.

02:47:52.800 --> 02:47:53.800
Yay!

02:47:53.800 --> 02:47:54.800
It was a...

02:47:54.800 --> 02:47:55.800
What is it?

02:47:55.800 --> 02:47:56.800
Beauty of Silence.

02:47:56.800 --> 02:47:57.800
No, wait.

02:47:57.800 --> 02:48:03.400
I forget what song it was. It was, it was, no, it was Beauty of Silence or...

02:48:03.400 --> 02:48:06.440
I think it was, oh, I can't remember. I'll remember it.

02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:09.680
But it was, it was Full Combo. Yay! I have one too!

02:48:09.680 --> 02:48:12.840
I passed three other 2DX songs today.

02:48:12.840 --> 02:48:16.800
Yay! Gotta start somewhere. Full Combo too!

02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:20.960
Chat Room says, Dave, because he's insane, just look at him for the battle royale.

02:48:20.960 --> 02:48:24.960
I think I'd kick his ass. Alright.

02:48:24.960 --> 02:48:29.520
Shadow would like to clarify, Shadow would like to clarify, I haven't a clue but you're

02:48:29.520 --> 02:48:30.520
not around.

02:48:30.520 --> 02:48:38.840
Alright, Snub would like to say, on sackbamani.com who is deleted member and what happened?

02:48:38.840 --> 02:48:40.480
Oh god, you had to bring this up.

02:48:40.480 --> 02:48:44.600
Okay, our hosts suck a big ball of shit.

02:48:44.600 --> 02:48:49.340
What happened is that some of our files started getting either deleted or zeroed out, which

02:48:49.340 --> 02:48:51.660
means all the content in them was deleted.

02:48:51.660 --> 02:48:56.860
So threads are gone, members are gone, there's no rational explanation for it, it's just

02:48:56.860 --> 02:49:00.100
their servers deciding to fuck with our files.

02:49:00.100 --> 02:49:01.100
What?

02:49:01.100 --> 02:49:03.980
You know I thought it was a quota thing but it's not because it's still letting me upload

02:49:03.980 --> 02:49:04.980
new files.

02:49:04.980 --> 02:49:08.340
It's the wild monkey they have controlling the server there.

02:49:08.340 --> 02:49:09.340
Delete.

02:49:09.340 --> 02:49:10.340
Delete.

02:49:10.340 --> 02:49:11.340
Delete.

02:49:11.340 --> 02:49:12.340
Delete.

02:49:12.340 --> 02:49:13.340
Delete.

02:49:13.340 --> 02:49:16.500
Don't ever use onedollarhosting.com, they suck big balls.

02:49:16.500 --> 02:49:20.060
But the press said yes!

02:49:20.060 --> 02:49:21.860
Moving on.

02:49:21.860 --> 02:49:28.180
We're working on a backup plan as we speak.

02:49:28.180 --> 02:49:29.620
I'm going to make forums.

02:49:29.620 --> 02:49:32.420
I don't know how, but I will.

02:49:32.420 --> 02:49:34.260
Another show of hands for Justin, please.

02:49:34.260 --> 02:49:35.260
Another show of hands.

02:49:35.260 --> 02:49:36.260
Here we go.

02:49:36.260 --> 02:49:38.300
How many people like Cup of Child?

02:49:38.300 --> 02:49:40.300
Cup of Child, anybody?

02:49:40.300 --> 02:49:41.300
Three?

02:49:41.300 --> 02:49:42.300
Four.

02:49:42.300 --> 02:49:43.300
Okay, four.

02:49:43.300 --> 02:49:44.300
Okay.

02:49:44.300 --> 02:49:51.300
Okay. Last question, gang. Last question. This is a good one. We can go around the room

02:49:54.100 --> 02:49:57.980
and ask everyone this. This one comes from Vidpowah. And Vidpowah would like to know

02:49:57.980 --> 02:50:02.100
from everybody, and everybody's experienced enough with this game now, what is your favorite

02:50:02.100 --> 02:50:09.100
2DX video? Let's go around. Let's go around. Starting with Jamie, or you want to go last?

02:50:09.100 --> 02:50:13.100
What else? Stoic.

02:50:13.100 --> 02:50:21.100
I was gonna say the same thing, stoic.

02:50:21.100 --> 02:50:38.100
Okay, um, wow wow 70s because where else does like broccoli have an afro along with skyscrapers and all this other cool stuff that sends out afro rays and triple A's the world with afros. It's just cool.

02:50:38.100 --> 02:50:43.100
Go afro.

02:50:43.100 --> 02:50:45.100
Um...

02:50:45.100 --> 02:50:50.100
I'll have to say, I like Bad Routine, that's pretty good.

02:50:50.100 --> 02:50:55.100
Yeah, Bad Routine is a guy dancing, or Dancer's pretty good.

02:50:55.100 --> 02:51:00.100
But, if you want to go with iCandy, you can't be Last Message, because there's giant breasts.

02:51:00.100 --> 02:51:02.100
Oh yeah.

02:51:02.100 --> 02:51:04.100
Rob Lick Boots today.

02:51:04.100 --> 02:51:20.100
I would probably say my favorite one is, and people will laugh at me about this, but the Calcutta video, because Dr. Bombay is my hero and he owns you and second best is SOS, but if you get SOS you have to get the full video on Kazal.

02:51:20.100 --> 02:51:30.100
This is probably really generic and everybody's favorite, but I have to say Alien World because it's got the cool little alien puppet doll thingies.

02:51:30.100 --> 02:51:37.100
Alien World gave me nightmares the first time I saw it. I had a dream of weird alien people coming to kill me. I'm done.

02:51:37.100 --> 02:51:45.100
Alright, Angel made a decision, finally. I chose B because, well, yeah, it turns out that one too.

02:51:45.100 --> 02:51:47.100
I can't believe I didn't think about this.

02:51:47.100 --> 02:51:51.100
The best one has to be, uh, one of the best ones has to be, uh, Gradius Cyber.

02:51:51.100 --> 02:51:53.100
Yeah, Gradius Cyber.

02:51:53.100 --> 02:51:57.100
I was like, I thought I was changing my mind. I was thinking about using, thinking about slag work.

02:51:57.100 --> 02:51:59.100
Mmm. Burning Heat?

02:51:59.100 --> 02:52:03.100
For me, I have a couple. One of them is definitely a Sweet Lab.

02:52:03.100 --> 02:52:05.100
Because it's so cute.

02:52:05.100 --> 02:52:12.100
But my overall favorite one, actually I really like Burning Heat because it's also Gradius 2, which is one of my favorite shooter games ever.

02:52:12.100 --> 02:52:17.100
I love the little thingies walking around with the little sign that says,

02:52:17.100 --> 02:52:18.100
WIN!

02:52:18.100 --> 02:52:19.100
The beeps!

02:52:19.100 --> 02:52:21.100
Jelly kiss.

02:52:21.100 --> 02:52:22.100
Whatever.

02:52:22.100 --> 02:52:27.100
My favorite, I have a serious favorite and a fun favorite.

02:52:27.100 --> 02:52:29.100
Well, I have a couple serious favorites.

02:52:29.100 --> 02:52:30.100
Okay, then my overall.

02:52:30.100 --> 02:52:31.100
Okay, my favorite videos.

02:52:31.100 --> 02:52:32.100
Reincarnation.

02:52:32.100 --> 02:52:33.100
Yes.

02:52:33.100 --> 02:52:34.100
Good, good, good.

02:52:34.100 --> 02:52:35.100
Dancer.

02:52:35.100 --> 02:52:36.100
Good, good, good.

02:52:36.100 --> 02:52:40.100
And then my favorite 2DX video of all time, and a lot of people forget about this one,

02:52:40.100 --> 02:52:43.880
this one, but it honestly is the most kick-ass 2DX video they ever did, because they cut

02:52:43.880 --> 02:52:48.880
it after a couple styles were set. Sometime. Sometime is the best 2DX video.

02:52:48.880 --> 02:52:51.880
No, Route 80s. Route 80s is, like, the best one ever.

02:52:51.880 --> 02:52:56.160
You know, the best one is Nothing Ain't Stopping Us.

02:52:56.160 --> 02:52:59.600
Funky Bingo Paradise. Because you can't beat the boogie dancers.

02:52:59.600 --> 02:53:04.800
It's freakin' Funky Bingo Paradise. Wait, wait, wait. I gotta add another one,

02:53:04.800 --> 02:53:09.080
just because it's all about us. It's all about Love Is Orange.

02:53:09.080 --> 02:53:10.780
was orange

02:53:10.780 --> 02:53:13.380
i don't think it was you

02:53:13.380 --> 02:53:17.820
six of them alright so they've gotten it i don't like every decent two d x

02:53:17.820 --> 02:53:20.040

alright uh... we need to

02:53:21.840 --> 02:53:23.560

02:53:23.560 --> 02:53:24.860

02:53:24.860 --> 02:53:29.840
guess what kids i'm a broken record a broken record okay

02:53:29.840 --> 02:53:33.920
it's time for the final thoughts the show's over and i've got to get the

02:53:33.920 --> 02:53:37.040
fuck outta here right it's nine thirty hits so

02:53:37.040 --> 02:53:39.440
Let's go around and get final thoughts.

02:53:39.440 --> 02:53:40.760
You want to go around the room again?

02:53:40.760 --> 02:53:42.600
Start with Magus.

02:53:42.600 --> 02:53:44.000
All right, start with Magus.

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:45.240
Final thought, please.

02:53:45.240 --> 02:53:47.800
And whee!

02:53:47.800 --> 02:53:48.320
Angel.

02:53:48.320 --> 02:53:52.240
I'll grab the mic later.

02:53:52.240 --> 02:53:53.440
I'll grab the mic later.

02:53:53.440 --> 02:53:55.880
All right, Dave.

02:53:55.880 --> 02:53:57.000
Xenon sucks.

02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:58.640
I'm not a tool.

02:53:58.640 --> 02:54:05.680
And I will hopefully be able to go to B3 and do awesome.

02:54:05.680 --> 02:54:34.680
New CBS update for Step Manias, came out on the 27th, that's pretty good, then there's also my site, since my site right now is up, and has all the DDR extreme and everything, pretty much every single official sim file out there I have, and DDR UK is down right now, and single width Bemani cell is down, so my server is the only place you can get them, too bad I haven't updated my pages to tell you how to get it.

02:54:34.680 --> 02:54:36.680
My page is the hell you had to get it.

02:55:04.680 --> 02:55:10.680
Also, I may suck at freestyling, but how far did the judges get in PA?

02:55:10.680 --> 02:55:21.680
Also, next week I will have a video game review prepared with the help of Darkchild, who will also be helping me out with that. I'm done.

02:55:21.680 --> 02:55:33.120
This is the girl that has no voice.

02:55:33.120 --> 02:55:37.160
I don't know what to say except Ra Moon is the best drink in the world and that's about

02:55:37.160 --> 02:55:38.160
it.

02:55:38.160 --> 02:55:39.160
Yay!

02:55:39.160 --> 02:55:40.160
Everybody have fun.

02:55:40.160 --> 02:55:41.160
Hi to all my friends out there.

02:55:41.160 --> 02:55:42.160
Everybody.

02:55:42.160 --> 02:55:43.160
What?

02:55:43.160 --> 02:55:46.320
I guess I have no friends.

02:55:46.320 --> 02:55:47.320
Shereequah.

02:55:47.320 --> 02:55:48.320
Okay.

02:55:48.320 --> 02:55:49.320
I'm done.

02:55:49.320 --> 02:55:50.840
I'm done.

02:55:50.840 --> 02:55:53.160
Random quote, random quote.

02:55:53.160 --> 02:55:56.080
Dude, what was that shirt that had Sinead, Martin?

02:55:56.080 --> 02:55:57.600
It had Sinead in it.

02:56:00.600 --> 02:56:02.120
Angel, your final thought?

02:56:02.120 --> 02:56:05.840
Topo is white and squishy, but I don't know if Magus is white.

02:56:05.840 --> 02:56:08.800
Magus is white, but I don't know if he's squishy.

02:56:08.800 --> 02:56:09.300
Blink.

02:56:09.300 --> 02:56:10.360
You don't need to know this.

02:56:10.360 --> 02:56:11.320
Blink, blink.

02:56:11.320 --> 02:56:12.600
Look at the quote from the chat room.

02:56:12.600 --> 02:56:13.280
Check the top.

02:56:13.280 --> 02:56:14.240
Jonas.

02:56:14.240 --> 02:56:15.240
I know, final thoughts.

02:56:15.240 --> 02:56:18.000
I'll be making a one, I'll be making a D-Direct file that's

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:21.000
I'm gonna be in the next tournament whenever it comes out.

02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:25.000
Oh well.

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:37.000
And, you're a freak that needs to stop having those blood viruses that, you know, cause you know, cause you know, you know the sacri- the sacri-

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000
I'm a Sacramento marshman that's on thread.

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:43.000
Sometimes the spaces get, um, are off.

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:48.000
And I know I'm two hours late, but F you to really bad April Fools pranks.

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:53.000
There's a lot of people that tried stupid pranks and you can see right through them and we call them on it and we ruin their fun.

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:58.000
Okay, I don't know how so many people fell for mine.

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:03.000
I said I was moving to Seattle.

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:08.000
There's some things you don't joke about. Because there's some things you just don't joke about.

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:15.000
p0k3smot42o I've never heard an implementable joke that I was able to pull off

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:25.000
My final thought is, um, uh, why don't you give me a sign?

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000
Never mind. Angel?

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:28.000
I didn't have my final thought.

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:29.000
Oh, Jamie?

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:37.000
My final thought is, I want ice cream.

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000
The system is down.

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000
Suck me one of your rules and I want to do this again.

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:42.000
And again.

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:44.000
Okay, I'll shut up.

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:46.000
Seriously, I want ice cream.

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:49.000
For my birthday, give me the Battle Royale novel.

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.000
April 19th.

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000
No, I won't tell you how old I will be.

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000
You get the very final word, Jamie. What is it?

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:56.000
I guess.

02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:57.000
Die!

02:57:57.000 --> 02:58:01.000

And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

02:58:47.520 --> 02:58:49.520
Hot as Paulie, white, bold, mean

02:58:49.520 --> 02:58:51.520
Elegant, and it a queen

02:58:51.520 --> 02:58:52.520
Victory, Belle, and Magneton

02:58:52.520 --> 02:58:54.520
Everybody will come on!

02:59:07.520 --> 02:59:08.520
Aerodactyl, steel, macho

02:59:08.520 --> 02:59:10.520
Marimals, reeds, and soul-poke

02:59:10.520 --> 02:59:11.520
Articuno, diddle-muff

02:59:11.520 --> 02:59:13.520
Flair, beyond, and old, spy-duck

02:59:13.520 --> 02:59:15.520
Voice, searching, or tell the glue

02:59:15.520 --> 02:59:18.520
And a corpse of blue jackals and charmelians

02:59:18.520 --> 02:59:20.520
Everybody pull drum on!

02:59:36.520 --> 02:59:38.520
It's time to pull drum

02:59:38.520 --> 02:59:41.520
For Ponyta and Pidgey too

02:59:41.520 --> 02:59:44.520
Come on, put on your liter hose

02:59:44.520 --> 02:59:51.520
Let's try not to stamp a little because you better grab yourself a partner

02:59:51.520 --> 02:59:54.520
Like an accrual or Bulbasaur

02:59:54.520 --> 02:59:57.520
Hold on a minute

02:59:57.520 --> 03:00:00.520
There's still at least a hundred and twenty-seven more

03:00:00.520 --> 03:00:02.520
Including Ladybot and all the stars

03:00:02.520 --> 03:00:04.520
Jinx, Velocim, and Magmar

03:00:04.520 --> 03:00:06.520
Geodude and Arcanine

03:00:06.520 --> 03:00:07.520
Jigglypuff and Mr. Mime

03:00:07.520 --> 03:00:09.520
Don't forget about Soundclack

03:00:09.520 --> 03:00:10.520
Execute and Rabadat

03:00:10.520 --> 03:00:12.520
Lixitons and Porygon

03:00:12.520 --> 03:00:33.340
