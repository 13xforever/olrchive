Attention!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The Monty Talk and then some.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Orange Lounge may contain adult cunt.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,280
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

10
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,000
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex. In this episode...

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,800
Hey, are there any balls down there?

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,500
That's the biggest berry you've ever seen, Jingleberry.

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,500
What's your favorite scary movie?

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,400
Showgirls. Absolutely frightening. What's yours?

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,900
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

16
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,700
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.

17
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,700
Now's the time on sprockets, then we dodge!

18
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,200
I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too!

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,700
I don't cook food.

20
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,200
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,700
Why did they have to take the word gay?

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,700
Oh, what I expect from a Spanish expression is gentle.

23
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,200
Hey, hey, hey!

24
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,700
Shut up! Where's my gun? This is my boom stick.

25
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,700
Come on, girls, it's time to drop the bomb.

26
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,700
I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.

27
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,700
What kind and what human being would find that funny?

28
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,700
Orange Lounge Radio.

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,700
We are live, but not really.

30
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,700
And this is episode number 42 for April the 27th of 2003.

31
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:52,700
You're tuned into the Bimani Scene's most premeditated radio station of all things Bimani.

32
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,700
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky.

33
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,700
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Ms. Jamie Summers.

34
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,700
You know her better as DarkSakra.

Loki is out today because he's doing stuff.

39
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,700
He broke his track record again.

40
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,160

53
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,760
yeah so it's going to be an interesting show tonight because there's just

54
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,760
there's really not a lot tonight

55
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,480

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,400
the Orange Don't play money music in more shows?

72
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:43,920
The music is like being transported to this dancing spaceship place.

73
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:50,200
It's unearthly, it's like being in a club, except you don't have to ask someone to dance.

Oh, no joke.

95
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,900
Finally, I've been in the intro for a long time.

96
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,900
Who?

97
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,900
I think who.

98
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,900
Who?

99
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:10,900
What was it I was watching that had the monkey jacking off?

100
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,900
Well, Conan O'Brien has the masturbating bear.

101
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:20,900
No, it was I think a video tape of these people at the zoo and the monkey was Lincoln.

102
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,900
They show that on cable or something

103
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,380
Oh my god, I watched the blue girl live-action

104
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:38,260
Love blue girl live-action. God. It was horrible describe a blue girl for the uninitiated

105
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:43,820
Today, we're painting on Orange Lounge Radio.

106
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
We're going to make a happy cloud.

107
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:53,100
Fluffy white clouds of cocaine.

108
00:10:53,100 --> 00:11:02,920
I was so sad when Bob Ross died.

109
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,180
What other people have died recently that made me go,

110
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,180
Mr. Rogers?

111
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,180
Oh, Nell Carter.

112
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,180
She was cool.

113
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,180
Shut up.

114
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,180
I like Nell Carter.

115
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,180
She was cool.

116
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,180
Are you still watching?

117
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,180
Give me a break.

118
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,180
Give me a break.

119
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,180
Oh.

120
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:29,700
So, yeah, interesting week for us.

121
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,780
I think we've all just been very busy and doing random sorts of things.

122
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,780
It's been like a crazy week for me.

123
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:09,780
It's multi-purpose. You can clip it anywhere. You can clip it on your nipple if you wanted to.

124
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:14,780
I have these shelves that are over my computer desk where we keep our old school stuff.

125
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:19,780
Not a nipple clamp lamp, bleh.

126
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,780
It's a tongue twister, nipple clamp lamp.

127
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,780
That's the new Erotic song, isn't it?

128
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,780
Yes, the new Erotic single, nipple clamp lamp.

129
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,780
Yeah, it's the B-side to temple of butt.

130
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:52,780
You know what's interesting is that Dark Tetsuya, who's an obsessive listener of this show, pointed out in the chat room a while back that actually in an earlier episode, and he cites episode 12, I apparently actually said something about Mr. Rogers is not dead, or something like that. I don't remember the exact quote.

131
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,780
Yeah, at that point Mr. Rogers is not dead.

132
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,780
Yeah, at that point Mr. Rogers is not dead. This is funny that we brought it up on the show.

133
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:06,780
By the way, and I appreciate our listeners, but when you remember episode numbers, you've got this time that you need to go on vacation.

134
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:11,780
Well, if I remember right though, episode 12 was the second episode we broadcast this week.

135
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,780
Okay, but I haven't been keeping up with episode 12.

136
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,780
I haven't either, but I think episode 12 was...

137
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:24,780
Dear people, if you refer to a specific event, don't refer to it by episode number because we sure as fuck don't remember.

138
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,780
Do you remember Episode 3?

139
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,780
No.

140
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,780
Oh my God, I wasn't here.

141
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,780
Yeah, you weren't here.

142
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:35,020
I remember that, because I remember when Orange Lounge Radio started, you were here the first

143
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,020
week.

144
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,020
We had everybody here the first week.

145
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,020
And then the second and third week, it was like, I'm going to Anime Expo, bye.

146
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,020
That was it, too.

147
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:48,080
I was like, um, I'm in L.A., bye, I'm in San Diego, bye.

148
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,580
And then we were just kind of here without Jamie for a couple weeks.

149
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,580
And then I went to Alabama, bye.

150
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:59,580
I don't know. I second traffic in San Francisco. I don't think what did the show was Alabama, but I don't know them happen before

151
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,380
June 23rd

152
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,740
Yeah, but I was stuck in traffic in San Francisco one time I remember that too yeah

153
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,340
Hey, you were not were like next door. Yeah, we're going back in

154
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:18,340
kostjamrh Who else would have a higher end?

155
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:51,720
And sometimes, even when we're not having a show, I take Michael and Neil home.

156
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,000
I do fuck off all the time, so maybe I have the highest attendance after all, because

157
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,300
I attended my own home.

158
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,560
I work from home.

159
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,560
You work from home.

160
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,560
I see.

161
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,560
Seriously.

162
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,500
So, God, what else is new this week?

163
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,980
It's such an interesting show tonight, because there's just nothing to talk about.

164
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:19,160
I know aren't you excited about tonight's show listeners. I know how to get you excited good

165
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,300
I'll load some porn. It's funny. Let's just get drunk. That'll be funny

166
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,900
I'm just kidding. I know I actually

167
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:34,420
Pretend we're getting drunk, and then then if the show is really bad because we're lagging we can just say we're drunk. We were drunk. Sorry

168
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,740
Jamie'll get drunk, and I'll get high and then you'll be sober, so they don't have all festival over

169
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:44,980
I don't know why don't I huh you can get drunk you can get high and I'll have sex

170
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,420
I'll be in the other

171
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,900
We need to have we need

172
00:15:55,060 --> 00:16:01,140
We need a black person we need our we need either an Asian or a Pacific Islander

173
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,820
We need to have

174
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,820
Yeah, we need the person with bad hygiene.

175
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,820
We need everybody to hate somebody else.

176
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,820
We need the racist.

177
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,820
And the racist has to be a roommate.

178
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,820
We have Loki.

179
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,820
We have Loki.

180
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,820
I don't know where Loki is tonight.

181
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,820
He just said he wouldn't be available tonight.

182
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,820
I think he's either fapping

183
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:26,820
or he's probably getting ready for the moving on Saturday

184
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,820
which is one reason we're taped tonight.

185
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,820
Maybe he's having special time with us.

186
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:38,060
Who has time for relationships?

187
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:47,060
I sure don't.

188
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:52,300
Well there is a little bit of news, actually there's a lot of news, we're just being lazy.

189
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,740
We're procrastinating for next week.

190
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,200
Who said we'd bring you news timely?

191
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,800
You know I realize we kind of lied last week.

192
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,880
We said that last week was the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio from this studio, but

193
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,280
we're actually in the studio tonight.

194
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,920
Tonight's the last episode in the studio, even though we're pre-taped.

195
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,920
I'm confused.

196
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,920
I just went cross-eyed.

197
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,920
Yeah.

198
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,920
I want ice cream.

199
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,920
Let's go get ice cream.

200
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,920
Fuck this show.

201
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,920
Bye.

202
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,920
I had salad today.

203
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
Did you?

204
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,920
From where?

205
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,920
The grocery store.

206
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,920
Did you toss your salad?

207
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,920
Yes, I did actually.

208
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,920
It landed on the cat.

209
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,920
You know what's funny? I had a salad today, too, and I shook my salad.

210
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:47,920
Alright, one interesting thing that's in Bamani News this week. DanceMania EX3 just came out, and I don't have a copy, and I want one. So somebody get me one.

211
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,920
What the fuck's on this one this time?

212
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,920
Get this. Ace of Base, first track. How cool is that?

213
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,920
C.A.R.I.M.I.E.M.I.E.C.H.

214
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,920
The only way I remember that song is through Moulin Rouge.

215
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,920
I've never seen it.

216
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,920
I know. You've never seen Moulin Rouge. We've got to make you watch that sometime.

217
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,920
But there's this part where they, you know, they're going back and forth between all these love songs, and then there's that part where

218
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,920
I was made for loving you, baby, you were made for loving me.

219
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,920
I should never sing on this show.

220
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,920
Yes.

221
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,920
In the fight.

222
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,920
Any other fun Dance Mania albums coming out that we should give a mention to?

223
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,920
Nah, don't look like it.

224
00:19:51,920 --> 00:20:01,920
It's Castlevania, and get this, the new Castlevania is coming out, and look at that, it's 3D.

225
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,920
Come on, Castlevania dungeon.

226
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,920
Yes.

227
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:09,920
Okay, wait a second, but the last time they tried to do a 3D Castlevania game, it sucked shit.

228
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,920
This is new.

229
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,920
Yeah, it was up yesterday.

230
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,920
Okay, you know what?

231
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:28,920
But this is what it says at the bottom, it says the article says this game will be entirely in 3D, but is not intended to be like Castlevania 64, which the producer openly admitted to hating.

232
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,920
The game takes place in the 11th century apparently, but other story details are pretty vague.

233
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,920
God damn it, they need to do another one with Richter.

234
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,920
Everybody pray to whatever god you believe in that this game does not suck, please.

235
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,920
They need another game with Richter.

236
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,880
or as

237
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:52,880
uh... maria said in english

238
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,780
you know you're getting another

239
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,620
what's that

240
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,080
freaking gradius five

241
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,800
what's that about

242
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,700
it's new

243
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,260
Gradius 5 on the PS2.

244
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,260
On the piece of shit too.

245
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,260
Sorry.

246
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,620
Oh it is.

247
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,620
Now-

248
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:30,380
Just because they took parts out of old space shuttles and stuff to make this thing doesn't

249
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,380
mean it's not accessible.

250
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,460
I just think people can't program for it for shit or else we would definitely have games

251
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:40,260
that looked better.

252
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:46,460
Metal Gear Solid 2 was nice, but it was better on Xbox, I have to say, because there was

253
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,460
more room for anti-aliasing.

254
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:58,060
That's why I like the new substance on PC, because it's just as good as your system is.

255
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,060
If you've got the best card in the world, it'll look better than anything you've got.

256
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,060
You know what?

257
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,060
Tekken 3 and Metal Gear Solid on Bling Bling.

258
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,060
Bling Bling.

259
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,060
That was really good.

260
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:16,060
Rob is off, you know, scratching his head.

261
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:44,060
so i really have no interest in u.s ps2 games

262
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,560
i've already seen the ending

263
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,740
shhh no spoilers

264
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,440
you could just get a mod chip and you know

265
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,460
why

266
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,120
because any other game that's going to come out after that is not going to work

267
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,000
okay i used to say that when the ps2 just came out because it's

268
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,600
understandable you know it just came out but now ps2 is kinda

269
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,780
it's starting to become the end of its life and

270
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:08,300
all the best games that are out I mean so how about when you if you mind your

271
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,020
system now and then seventh style comes out and it won't work with your system

272
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,660
then I'll go buy seventh style

273
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,980
I mean seventh style will work as a

274
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,160
purchased version I don't need to take pictures of it to play it

275
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,700
and seventh style won't come out

276
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,340
I've heard that before about you know that the

277
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,380
you get the mod chip and then

278
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,840
sony could release a game that would basically fuck up your mod chip or not or you

279
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,840
You know, they override the computation, kind of like they did with the early chips on the PS1.

280
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,840
Sony was even doing it right to the end of the Playstation's line.

281
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,840
Right. And what's interesting about that is what they could do with it is they could do it through online purposes.

282
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:54,840
It's possible, you know, if your PS2 is online, you go online with Final Fantasy XI, and then sneak sneak, it's updating your BIOS.

283
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,840
That's why I just will play on the computer, because it's coming out for computer in America.

284
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:11,840
By the way, if anyone is interested in that, if you go to squareenixusa.com, you can submit an application to beta test Final Fantasy XI for PC or for PS2.

285
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,840
I really hope they choose me for beta testing.

286
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,840
Please, please Square, I've played your game since the beginning.

287
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,840
I'm more than positive I'm going to get selected because I've done game beta testing before.

288
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,840
I played Ragnarok online, ew.

289
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:31,840
Yeah, that sucks they didn't continue that over here because I really want to play Ragnarok.

290
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,840
They're still in beta testing right now.

291
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,840
Yeah, but it's like they're only working with...

292
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,840
The paid release is going to be out I think for the next couple months.

293
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,840
And they are going to America with it?

294
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,840
Because it sounded like they were neglecting America.

295
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,840
They have an American beta test open right now.

296
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,840
Well, I mean, it's closed, it's a closed beta, but they have it going on right now.

297
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,840
I know it's been talked about on here, but for those who don't know,

298
00:24:50,840 --> 00:25:00,840
ragnorockonline.com

299
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,340
It was about the closest you can get.

300
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:25,340
It's like, it's like Secret of Mana with Final Fantasy Tactics type jobs and things.

301
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,340
And you can beat up ants and grasshoppers that play the fiddle.

302
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,340
Fucking fiddle playing grasshoppers.

303
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,340
I don't know if you've seen it, but PopCap.com, they're the folks that make like Bejeweled

304
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:39,340
and all those like really addicting little web games that people play online.

305
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,340
Oh, it's pretty addicting.

306
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,340
Atomica, you probably haven't played any of those games, huh?

307
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,340
Well, PopCap's the company that makes all those games, they have a new game on their site

308
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:53,740
kind of like you know it's a multiplayer ish type game which is online world type

309
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:58,460
thing which at first look at kind of you know just first instinct was oh it's like

310
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:03,380
a 3d Ragnarok kind of thing but it's it still needs a lot of tweaking but it's

311
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:07,940
interesting it's worth checking out the popcap comments because free I think if

312
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:14,840
you pay money you get special things but hey I'm still doing Neopets okay I have

313
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,840
I have not checked on my Neopet in two weeks, damn thing's probably dead.

314
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,840
Give me all your money.

315
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,840
I don't want to give you my money.

316
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,840
If you love your pet, give me your money.

317
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,840
Why?

318
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,840
So that I can get up to 500,000 Neopets.

319
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,840
I think I have like 25,000.

320
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,840
That's actually about what I need.

321
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,840
Really?

322
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,840
Mwahaha.

323
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,840
Seriously, I've been trying to get up to...

324
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,840
Is that like the last level of saving?

325
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,840
No.

326
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,840
Oh.

327
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,840
That's about three on it.

328
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:47,920
to upgrade to my next bank account.

329
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,480
OK, why don't we take ourselves a quickie little break.

330
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,080
We're going to come back.

331
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,680
We're going to talk about Max 2.

332
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,960
Max 2, Japan, came out this week.

333
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,800
And there's been some interesting early reaction.

334
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,760
We're sitting here on Thursday night, pre-taping Sunday show.

335
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,720
And there's already been some early reactions.

336
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,280
Some folks in the States have picked it up and have

337
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,120
some interesting things to say about it.

338
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,160
So we will take a quick break.

339
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,360
About the overwhelming lack of monkeys.

340
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,160
yes about the lack of monkey sex we're gonna play some another's for the hell

341
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,000
of it

342
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,120
uh... we're feeling uh... saucy so let's start this off with speak up another

343
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:20,840
will be back

344
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:27,840
on Orange Lawn Radio.

345
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,840
Go, go, go, go, go!

346
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,840
Oh

347
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,660
But, and I was sitting here going, this song isn't any different.

348
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:29,300
And then finally, they're like, wait, Jamie and Brad are like, wait, wait for it, wait

349
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,300
for it.

350
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:34,700
And then finally in the end, it has that little way different part of the end.

351
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:40,540
So what a cool roll to see if I'm getting drunk.

352
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:44,420
All right, you're getting drunk.

353
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:58,420
We're talking about the potential battle royale game that's going to be going on.

354
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,420
Yeah, what's this?

355
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:03,980
You've taken this battle royale kind of, well, I hate to call it a joke, because it's not

356
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:10,780
really a joke, but it's kind of like this, instead of an inside joke, it's like an inside

357
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:16,000
cult. It's basically what it has come down to. You've got this little inside cult of

358
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,180
folks here locally in Sacramento and abroad because it's kind of spawned from the Orange

359
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:26,220
Lounge chat room and then some. Just this obsession with the movie Battle Royale. And

360
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,220
now...

361
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:38,080
I'm running a game probably in a few weeks. Me and Jess and now Puppy's involved.

362
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:43,460
Puppy's testing his dice script in our chat room right now, but we're uh, yeah

363
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:49,180
It's gonna be definitely a dice based. Go ahead and give a couple little spoilers about that

364
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,140
We've already selected what the random weapons are

365
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,540
There's gonna be people are gonna have certain skills like, you know people normally do

366
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:05,520
You've got your stats, you know, we'll help you with that. We're

367
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:14,520
I'm sort of half deciding of having the game last a few weeks more than just the normal, however many it takes to kill everybody off.

368
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:21,520
So you can establish what your character's like and your friends and your group before you decide to kill each other off.

369
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,520
So how exactly is it going to work? Is it going to be like a chat room that runs 24 hours a day?

370
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,520
No.

371
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,520
No, it's only going to be a certain day and time.

372
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:34,520
It's going to be probably three hours until the game should last, or until we say, okay, we're tired.

373
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,520
Got it.

374
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,520
And it's going to be one night a week.

375
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,520
I'll do my best to put it on a Friday night.

376
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,520
I'm thinking a Friday night would be the best night for this.

377
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,520
And basically, you roleplay.

378
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:53,520
And if you suck at roleplay, by the way, as in you're not staying in character,

379
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,520
You're not developing your character, even though your character is going to die.

380
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,520
You'll just die all the faster.

381
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,520
Because I'm a pretty spiteful GM.

382
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,520
Which is probably why I will not be participating, because I suck at roleplay.

383
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:13,520
I was always there to provoke the GM in interesting ways.

384
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,520
Well, I sometimes think that it's a little bit easier to roleplay online.

385
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:25,520
online as opposed to tabletop, just because you have a little bit more room for some description

386
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:31,520
and you don't, if you're a shy person by nature you don't have to say something that you would

387
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,520
normally be uncomfortable saying, it's easier to type it.

388
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:43,520
Ah, you need to roleplay and say that in a British accent. Anyway, as promised, oh yeah,

389
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,520
Oh yeah, Brad, do you have something you want to say?

390
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,020
No.

391
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:47,520
Okay.

392
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,020
As we promised before the break...

393
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,020
I killed you!

394
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:55,520
We were going to talk about Max 2 just came out in Japan this week,

395
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,520
and there's probably more information on it now that it's Sunday,

396
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,020
but it's only Thursday when we're taping here,

397
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,020
and we don't know a lot at this point.

398
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:07,020
However, we do know what the unlocks are.

399
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:10,520
So, the unlocks that you're going to get in Max 2,

400
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:17,500
you've got me burping that's the first time like no the next unlock is all of

401
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:21,380
the um remix actually I don't know what order these unlock in sorry I haven't

402
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:25,740
gotten those kind of lists or anything but you get all the remixes the max 2

403
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:30,940
remixes that you can play in extreme right and then we know that you can

404
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:35,720
unlock crash or actually I think that's one of the songs you start off with is

405
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:43,120
crash and then a paranoia survivor and there was one more love love shine or

406
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:49,120
love love sugar one of those two love love shine it's love love shine you get

407
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:56,960
you also unlock almost everything from us a mix that was from the max USA that

408
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:04,320
was exclusive except the license tracks so you get shining Polaris peace out

409
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,320
Overblast, Logical Dash, Jammin' Marmalade, and I'm For Real.

410
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,320
You get all that.

411
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:13,320
And you also get Look to the Sky, True Color, Dynamite Rave, Downbird Soda.

412
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,320
You get all those songs.

413
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,320
We had them first.

414
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,320
Yeah, we had them first.

415
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,320
So, Neenar.

416
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,320
And we still have I Like to Move It.

417
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,320
Black Hawk.

418
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:27,320
Also, for whatever reason, they're bringing back Kind Lady and So in Love.

419
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:33,320
I mean, those songs are pretty cool and all, but it's kind of interesting because they were on the last mix.

420
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:37,320
Also, there's some brand spankin' new stuff.

421
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:46,320
Do It Right, the 80s electro mix, which is remixed by Soda, and I hear it's pretty good.

422
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,320
We had some folks in the chat room that have heard it, and it's pretty good.

423
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,320
As soon as we get MP3s, we'll play them for you guys.

424
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:57,320
Kind Lady, the interlude, whatever that could mean.

425
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,320
I wonder if that's just that little groove beat at the beginning.

426
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:10,640
You said it like a banjo. Rob does bluegrass.

427
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:17,080
You know what? Yeah, I want to get an MP3 so I don't have to sing this. I'm trying to

428
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,880
find an MP3 so you can hear what I'm talking about here. Okay, like this part.

429
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:26,920
Like the porno part.

430
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,920
We used that in a porn movie and we did one, so I remember that.

431
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,920
Or me, Rob.

432
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

433
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,920
Right, sure, yeah.

434
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,920
As I leave the room.

435
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,920
Also unlockable, Look to the Sky, the trance mix.

436
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,920
Which is not Look to the Sky, the true color mix.

437
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,920
Now there's going to be three Look to the Skies all together.

438
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,920
Look to the Sky fart mix.

439
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,920
Look to the Sky because it stinks down below.

440
00:39:51,920 --> 00:40:16,680
p0k3smot42o

441
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,220
It's like the lesson Oni.

442
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,040
Be For You, of course.

443
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,300
Because where would we be without a Be For You Oni course?

444
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:30,340
Nearly 130, however, since a minute it did not make it into Max 2 home version, they

445
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,120
have Spin the Disc replacing a minute.

446
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,400
Spin the Dix!

447
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,580
They have the From 2D X Course, except now it has like Gem of Marmalade and all these

448
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,700
other songs.

449
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:46,360
The Love Song collection, which is Baby Love Me, So in Love, Silent Hill, Dive,

450
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:51,160
Dive Into The Night, which I never knew was a love song, and My Summer Love.

451
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:55,200
Now they have a DJ Soda Oni, which is pretty cool.

452
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,480
A middle tempo chorus, which is like just kind of all like...

453
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:05,760
I'm just noticing something. It says DJ Soda Oni. Why is Kind Lady in there? I thought it was Okuyoto's.

454
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:11,480
But Kind Lady Interlude, I believe, is remixed by Soda.

455
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,320
Alright.

456
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:16,240
And then you have the middle tempo chorus, which is kind of like a bunch of dance mania songs.

457
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,480
you have a course called rap mania

458
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,960
and these are the songs

459
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,640
these are the songs that apparently are rap according to konami

460
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,280
long long train running

461
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,560
little boy

462
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,360
superstar

463
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,720
hysteria

464
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,340
detour

465
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:40,440
burn in the floor and be free

466
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,200
uh... there at the midnight blue courses back

467
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:49,200
Except they've replaced one song with another AM3P remix. I don't know what song they took out, but...

468
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,200
Do you remember the original Midnight Blue chorus?

469
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,200
No, I remember the original.

470
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,200
Alright, whatever, fine.

471
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:04,200
Now they have a BPM 140 chorus, so now we have nearly 130 and nearly 140.

472
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,200
Hooray.

473
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,200
A tricky chorus, which I'm not sure yet, but rumored...

474
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,200
What's wrong with all the changes?

475
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,640
like burning heat two-speed burst boost reverse and then kind lady three-speed

476
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:52,760
boost so it like it just fucks up all your modifiers there's a Naoki platinum

477
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:57,460
course which actually I believe is the same course I think that's the one

478
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:03,240
course that retained itself Wow I'll be damn some course in Japanese

479
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:08,160
well I don't know I can't translate it has a star in it so it's not really all

480
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:15,480
Japanese something woman is it like the diva course it could be I think these

481
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:20,160
are all yeah these are all songs by women yeah what's up oh and put it into

482
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:27,920
global gate yeah well let's see let's translate that

483
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:53,400
The answer is Maiden Way.

484
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,080
Up and down is another course.

485
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,720
I have no idea what these songs have in common.

486
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:08,320
And then there's the shitty Demon Road, which has D2R, Waka Laka, Transition Arrow, Stay,

487
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,720
Subaru, and Max Unlimited.

488
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,220
That's it.

489
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:15,400
And then there's the last chorus is Ultra 12, which has a bunch of interesting stuff

490
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,400
on it.

491
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,480
What about the Ultra 64?

492
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,480
No.

493
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,960
No Ultra 64.

494
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,760
How about your mom?

495
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,400
She's swell.

496
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,400
Not my mom.

497
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,400
Somebody else's mom.

498
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,400
Not to my mommy.

499
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,360
Someone's sick and very inch-long.

500
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:41,080
So you can order that now, DDR Max 2, and also if you ordered it from Konami style already,

501
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:45,280

502
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,920
CD that we talked about, like Glacial, the I Feel remix, the soda remix of I Feel and

503
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:56,920

504
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:03,920
one

505
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:08,760
all you have already heard yet there's some other features in there like you

506
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,120

507
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,540

508
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:19,540

509
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:26,760

510
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,760
So I have to get it next month.

511
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,760
What? I'm what?

512
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,760
You're doing that instead of being in such a good chat room.

513
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,760
Fuck the chat room.

514
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,760
No, just kidding.

515
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,760
I love the chat room.

516
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,760
For dinner.

517
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,760
He loves the chat room.

518
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,760
Op, I have boots.

519
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,760
Chuck, chuck.

520
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,760
Get you the hot bullets of shotgun to die.

521
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,760
Tell us about that story, Brad.

522
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,760
No.

523
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,760
Please, please.

524
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:29,760
I've been hearing from DarkSakuraSO that he's been saying the thing, he goes,

525
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,760
Get you the hot shotgun bullets to die.

526
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:38,760
And it's kind of like in the vein of all your base, you know, bad English, some bad translation from an old Japanese game.

527
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:44,760
I found out on Engrish.com, which I love, go check it out, Engrish.com, great.

528
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,760
That it's from a game called Battle Rangers, so if you want to go pick up a ROM for it somewhere in your arcade,

529
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:58,760
and it's got some great Engrish jewels in there. Anyway, so yeah, check it out, it's

530
00:46:58,760 --> 00:46:59,760
funny.

531
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,160
Ah! Sorry, I was looking up something in the background.

532
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:09,040
We're going to do a segment on this show.

533
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,040
Hey, Cap, you're on Engrish!

534
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:21,040
Yeah, we're going to translate Konami's Q&A on Max 2, and we're going to read it.

535
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,920
So it's like a radio drama, so this will be fun.

536
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:29,040
So this segment is called Engrish Like What?

537
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,040
Engrish Like What?

538
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,040
Engrish Like What?

539
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,040
Engrish Like What?

540
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,040
Engrish Like What?

541
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:42,040
Alright, who wants to be Question Man and who wants to be Answer Man?

542
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:47,040
Alright, Brad, are you Question Man or Answer Man?

543
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,040
I'll be Question Man.

544
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,040
Alright, Question Man, first question.

545
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,040
You just sound like you're Mega Man.

546
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,040
Question Man, I will ask you a question.

547
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:59,040
Okay, so we have it in English. Is this it?

548
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:04,040
Okay, can an exclusive controller be used even if set to PS2?

00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:20,860
operates satisfactory yay best radio ever please this is a question please

551
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:24,800
leave with an arcade machine or teach me the method using editing data in the

552
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:30,740
PlayStation quote-unquote software dance dance revolution series when linked

553
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:35,940
within Arcade Machine, output Edit Data by Library Management. Copy the Edit Data file

554
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:41,160
which outputted to memory card for Playstation by browser of Playstation 2. The Edit Data

555
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:46,400
file copied to memory card for PlayStation can be used now by Arcade Machine etc. When

556
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,740
the Edit Data of the past series is used, copy an Edit Data file to the memory card

557
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:57,060
only for Playstation 2 from memory card for Playstation by the browser of Playstation 2".

558
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:04,060
Load the memory card, only for PlayStation 2 which copy data, and start edit mode input data by outside manager.

559
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:09,060
The data inputted by the edit library can be edited in edit mode or can be used in game mode.

560
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:14,060
Game mode? Oh, oh, very nice, very good.

561
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:20,060
Okay, is it the function in which a screen position can be adjusted care in Dance Dance Revolution?

562
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:26,060
The screen adjustment function of demand is added to option from the second edition DDR Max 2 of PS.

563
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:31,060
Please confirm by options. Graphic options screen adjustment.

564
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:34,060
Oh my god. You know what? Okay.

565
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:37,060
And that was Max 2 Engrish.

566
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:42,060
Max 2 Engrish. Max 2 Engrish. Max 2 Engrish.

567
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:43,060
I think it was Engrish like what originally.

568
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:45,060
Whatever. Oh yeah sorry.

569
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:49,060
Engrish like what? Engrish like what?

570
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:54,860
Okay, you know what's funnier because I've done this before is going to the Konami site, the 2dex site where they have

571
00:49:55,780 --> 00:50:01,780
They have like interviews with some of the artists for the new songs on each version when it comes out. Translate that shit

572
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:03,780
It's really fucking awful

573
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:09,060
Okay, well now you don't have to now. I'm just saying you know if you want to do this kind of thing someday, okay?

574
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,540
Yeah, because I'm sure you bored listeners too

575
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:16,820
and and by the way the site used for the translations is nifty.com slash

576
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:25,200
globally victory hey I have samurai showdown on neogeo and it does say

577
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:29,880
victory you know what's funny if you have the jet any of the Japanese games

578
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,920
like I have the Japanese samurai spirits too which is summer show now it'll play

579
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,660
it in American mode and turn all the blood into sweat so like these big

580
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,840
Geezers of white fluid comes shooting out of their bodies

581
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:50,340
Unbelievably powerful you are now finally the strongest pro team accepts your challenge

582
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:57,580
Yeah, I'm looking at English calm right now, it's it's definitely exciting

583
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:03,100
Let's see my spirit burns like the Sun and I shall dry you like a prune

584
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:31,220
Here's the ending to Ghosts and Goblins.

585
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:38,220
the wise and courageous door, a night that you are, you feel strong swelling in your

586
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:45,860
body. Return to starting point, challenge again.

587
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:50,860
I feel this strong swelling inside my body.

588
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:57,860
I think you need to see a doctor for that condition

589
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:26,500
for two centuries. Since the stardate had established, they sailed all around the

590
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:31,860
galaxy with new type spaceship called Lightship Lightship. But one day the

591
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:36,900
piece was disturbed by a mysterious big fortress. It was living and was destroying

592
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:42,020
all other civilizations. The Federal Bureau of Galactic Government organized

593
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:46,620
the defense force immediately, but as the air fortress had very high

594
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:52,620
potential the defense force was wiped out in vain so the federal bureau has

595
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:59,180
decided to select a specially trained man ID 2592 named Hal Bailman and has

596
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:04,440
developed a new type light brancer and armored suit now he departs for the air

597
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:11,200
fortress with a destiny of farmell farmell it sounds like propelled the

598
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:46,500
on this highly recommended by the staff of orange launch radio

599
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:52,340
yes i have to read this one

600
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:55,260
i'm cock

601
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:56,740
what kind of world of this

602
00:53:56,740 --> 00:54:03,740
it's kind of crap

603
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:07,680
his name is

604
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:16,680
Raman Saurus. He is urchin, has many curiosity, but he is a person who makes much good looks.

605
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:20,680
Yeah, Raman Sauruses have an image to uphold.

606
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,680
What? What are you looking for?

607
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,680
I think that I like the one that has World of Pain on it.

608
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,680
And then no smorking.

609
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,680
Thank you, man!

610
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:40,680
This is really, really brilliant radio.

611
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,680
Okay.

612
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:48,680
Okay, this is something that was posted on an evacuation map in a hotel in China.

613
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,680
Please keep calm when there is a fire.

614
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:55,680
The hotel will ensure your safety and shit with advanced fire facilities.

615
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:00,680
Please go to the exit according to the instructions so that our staff will lead you to safe zone.

616
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:22,680
Oh, the everyday I hate my life.

617
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:27,920
I hate my life. Every day I polish my revolver and I shoot my head like a rock star. I'm

618
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:28,920
cock, what?

619
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,920
I'm trying to read this chick's shirt. It says, I'm cock.

620
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:34,360
I'm home, I'm all alone, I need some, her coffee.

621
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,360
Hot coffee.

622
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:43,280
No, oh. There were three Jovial Welshmen as I have something.

623
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:50,000
And they would go hunting upon Saint Davids, said it was a ship, that either he said the

624
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:56,000
chimney blown away whatever. I want the one that says spread beaver showing the

625
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:07,000
vaginal area. It says showing the vaginal area. That's it.

626
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:20,420
I want that shirt. I would wear that shirt.

627
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:25,300
Spread Beaver was actually the name of a band in Japan fronted by the ex-Japan guitarist

628
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,300
Hide.

629
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:29,300
Yeah, but he's dead now. Is he?

630
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:30,300
Yeah.

631
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,300
He's living in front of the door.

632
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:46,300
Everybody said he hung himself, but what I heard is that he, uh, what he actually did was, um, when he practices guitar sometimes he would tie like a belt or something around his neck and then tie it to the back of a, um, like a door.

633
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:50,300
This sounds kind of crazy, but because he could lean his head forward, it would just rest his head or something.

634
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:54,300
And the only reason why I believe this is because I have friends that have done this before.

635
00:56:54,300 --> 00:57:00,300
It's some weird kind of relaxation thing, and I guess, like, it choked him to death or something, but I don't know.

636
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,300
Hey, fack you, man!

637
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:07,300
It's still stupid. I have my HIDE plushie hanging from a doorknob.

638
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,300
That's awful.

639
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,300
I bought a HIDE plushie.

640
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,300
He has this string on his head so you can hang him up.

641
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,300
So I was hanging a doorknob out by him.

642
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:24,300
Yeah, because apparently it was tied to the doorknob and that's when they found him or something, so...

643
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:27,300
That's really disgusting, but it's so funny.

644
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:31,300
I'm just, you know, being true to the original.

645
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,300
Oh, man.

646
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:39,300
Yeah, my JF game plushie has two bullet holes in its head and shoulder.

647
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:42,300
C'mon, anybody else want to play with the internet?

648
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:19,300
We wanted this to be a treat. For those of you who listen to Orange Alums radio a lot, we wanted this sneak preview of what is sure to be a very...

649
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:26,300
Turn off all pagers and cell phones. Thank you. Hope you have a nice play again.

650
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:32,300
We wanted this to be a special treat for those of you who listen to Orange Alums a lot to get to hear this show like before everyone else.

651
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,300
And aren't you happy?

652
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:38,300
Um, yeah, so we don't have a lot of people available to vote, but we can do one anyway.

653
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:40,300
Yes?

654
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:44,300
I think that we should do, um, um...

655
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:54,300
What is this, Guess My Cell Phone?

656
00:58:54,300 --> 00:59:18,900
p0k3smot42o

657
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,900
It was either that or this one.

658
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:22,200
reporting things on my cell phone is funny so i hope the cellphone up to make

659
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,820
your life i was talking on it but i had a point it out

660
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:27,620
so that the girl you know she's moaning in the background issues really highly

661
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:30,020
in some guy was flowing up an honor

662
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:32,380
just going

663

689
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:19,940
Just follow the beat, come on!

690
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:57,940
Jump out of the beach, jump out of the beach, come on, everybody let's go, jump out of the beach

691
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:51,940
Oh

692
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:21,940
Ha-cha!

693
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:40,940
Oh, come the egg on the mountain top

694
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:44,940
The punkiest monkey that ever hiked

695
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:48,940
He knew every last trick under the sun

696
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:52,940
She's a god, so everybody can have some fun

697
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:57,940
Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic

698
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:01,940
Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic

699
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:08,940
There's a little bit of Monkey Magic

700
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:12,940
To tell you where to find me

701
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:16,940
There's a little bit of Monkey Magic

702
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:32,940
Oh, from an egg on the mountain top, the punkiest monkey that ever talked.

703
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:37,940
He knew every magic under the sun.

704
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:41,940
He'd chase the gods and everyone had some fun.

705
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:58,940
Keep on keepin' magic, keep on keepin' magic

706
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:34,940
Bitch, get a new song! An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

707
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:38,940
Funny enough, she never did find a new song. We haven't heard from Joga in a long, long time.

708
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:43,940
Good. The only Joga I'm interested in is York.

709
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:48,940
State of emergency!

710
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:51,940
Yeah. Anywho.

711
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:54,940
Sorry, Rob, you're not small, cute, and Icelandic.

712
01:08:54,940 --> 01:09:03,940
You know what's interesting? I don't, I don't, okay, we've talked about her on the show before, this Japanese rocker girl chick who's awesome, her name's Kana.

713
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:05,940
And like, I got my, my-

714
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:08,940
You can play Nikku if you have it. Oh my god, you have to play Nikku.

715
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:11,940
I think I might, I think you've sent it to me. But anyway, I have a point to this.

716
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:19,940
Our new friend Garrett, who we discovered like randomly on a 2DX machine four weeks ago, and we just kind of picked him up and made him come home with us and play with us.

717
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:26,100
play with us. Not like that, you perverts. I was showing him Kana videos the other night

718
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:29,700
and he was just laughing his ass off going, this is great, she's kind of like the Japanese

719
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:39,700
Bjork. And I had a point to this story but I don't remember what it was.

720
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:45,700
I think so, she does at least speak secular, but Kana is cool.

721
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:47,700
Kana is the shit.

722
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:49,700
I think I sent you through those.

723
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:51,700
I have a question, was she from a band originally?

724
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:52,700
I don't think so.

725
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:54,700
Oh okay, I can swear she was from some other band.

726
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:56,700
Her whole gimmick is that she does the elegant...

727
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:57,700
Gothic Lolita stuff?

728
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:58,700
Yeah.

729
01:09:58,700 --> 01:09:59,700
Yeah.

730
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:02,700
She's, you know, I like when she's got a little panda thing and...

731
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:03,700
And she does panda bondage.

732
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:07,700
Yeah, she has a lot of panda bondage, which is really weird because they don't rape pandas, do you?

733
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:09,700
The poor pandas, they're like, you know...

734
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:11,700
They didn't rape the pandas, they just wrapped some ribbons.

735
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:12,700
Oh, okay.

736
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:13,700
Bondaged it.

737
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:15,700
I was gonna say the, uh, the WWF...

738
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:16,700
RIBBON!

739
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:17,700
...over you guys.

740
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:18,700
Rip what?

741
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:19,700
RIBBON!

742
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:20,700
RIBBON?

743
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:21,700
SORTED!

744
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:22,700
ARROWED!

745
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:23,700
What?

746
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:24,700
ORDINATE!

747
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:25,700
What?

748
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:26,700
Oh my.

749
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:28,700
Jamie's lost her...

750
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:30,700
Jamie has lost her mind.

751
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:31,700
Whatever.

752
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:32,700
Yes.

753
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:36,700
But for some reason I thought she was from like Malismizer, but that's a gag, I think.

754
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:40,700
Malice Meijer's never had a Nikita reverse cape unless she count Mana.

755
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:44,700
Oh yeah, oh that's right, it's the guy who looks like a girl.

756
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:48,700
And they both show up in the Gothic and Lolita Vibles.

757
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:52,700
Yeah, I saw in that one that Rob got you.

758
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:56,700
Shall we get to the FUs of the week now?

759
01:10:56,700 --> 01:11:22,060
It hurts a lot, it's been hurting me for like two weeks now and I'm thinking if I get in

760
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:29,060
And I have this other crap now that I'm going to take, and I have this heat pad attached

761
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:36,700
to my butt. It's sort of like in my pants. This is one that you wrap around your stomach,

762
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:42,700
except I couldn't get it to sit low enough, so I just tore the velcro part off and stuck

763
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:49,700
it in my pants. So now it's warm, my back is warm, my lower back is warm, but still

764
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:57,700
But still it hurts like fuck. It hurts like bondage fuck.

765
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:59,700
It hurts!

766
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:01,700
I don't know.

767
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:07,700
My other fuck you again goes to Squeamix for sucking.

768
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:13,700
And another one goes toward having no money so I can't have my games right now.

769
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:20,700
And a Happy Fuck You goes to the ending of Final Fantasy X-2, which I'm not going to spoil for anybody.

770
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:23,700
But I like it, but there needs to be more.

771
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:32,700
And also, a Fuck You, again, goes toward Final Fantasy X-2 for having a freaking confusing-ass storyline.

772
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:36,700
So I guess I'm not going to get it until I actually play through the game.

773
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:41,700
And, um, another one goes toward not really having any wine.

774
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:44,700
Cause, you know, yeah.

775
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:46,700
Cause I've had salad today and that's it.

776
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:49,700
Oh yeah, another front key goes toward not being able to digest anything.

777
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:50,700
Okay.

778
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,700
That was beautiful, thank you.

779
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:58,700
Um, I have some FUs this week.

780
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:03,700
My biggest FU this week goes to procrastination.

781
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:09,900
You guys have seen the house right and what's happening on Saturday? I'm moving you're moving

782
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:12,060
How many boxes have you seen that have been packed?

783
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:14,940
None, there's one in the living room

784
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:24,100
So I was given an interesting strategy on how to pack my shit because well, that's not dirty

785
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:27,100
I was giving you a strategy on how to pack stuff up

786
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:43,620
If California were going to fall off into the ocean and everyone had to evacuate to

787
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:52,060
an island, who do you think would be out first, the lesbians or the gay men?

788
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:54,660
The game would still be packing their shit. Well, let's get dropped like he split

789
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:03,300
My next step you of the week goes to bad jokes

790
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:08,520
You heard it in the taxi cab in Vegas

791
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:12,540
Bring it drunk god bless Vegas. I

792
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:15,460
Think I might have been yes

793
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:22,020
I was because it was with me and iguana girl and island are coming back from circus circus being drunk

794
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:23,380
off of

795
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:25,380
work for preaches

796
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:28,040
planes

797
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:31,300
well anyway i procrastinated and i have packed dampening and i'm moving on

798
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,340
saturday

799
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:35,420
actually know if you go out my garage i have a lot of shit boxes early do you

800
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:38,220
know why because they never unpacked last night

801
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:41,100
my house

802
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:44,940
so moving is going to be so bad as i've packed this up my

803
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:47,560
close all my clothes without

804
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:48,960
any hope

805
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,640
I had an interesting strategy sent to me on how to pack my stuff, and this was sent to

806
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:54,400
me by Garrett, somebody I was talking about earlier.

807
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:59,640
Get some big boxes and do something like label my boxes upper-right part of closet, lower-left

808
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:03,680
part of closet, shit on the floor in living room, and then fill them up accordingly.

809
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:04,680
That's how I pack.

810
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:05,680
I have another thing here.

811
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:13,600
I think I get hit by a spider.

812
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,240
On your cleavage.

813
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,240
Or if you're French.

814
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:22,240
Okay, I'm gonna go watch, because I think I have to buy a sweater, so fuck that fighter!

815
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:40,240
How do you always give me this?

816
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,240
That's just cute.

817
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:44,240
That's fuck you music. Okay.

818
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:51,240
Um, I had a fuck you, but my mind just went blank because I just got a phone call.

819
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:55,240
Anyway, um, what were we just talking about?

820
01:15:55,240 --> 01:16:00,240
Okay, oh yes, we were talking about Jamie's breasteses.

821
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:10,240
Okay, no, fuck you goes to people, no offense Jamie, but fuck you goes to people who spoil games for themselves and waiting...

822
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:15,240
No, for themselves. I mean, like, instead of waiting till the game comes out, they, like, read about the stories.

823
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:18,240
Yeah, Jamie's like, I'm getting the game anyway.

824
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,240
I'm poor, I can't have the game.

825
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:23,240
I know how this is connected to a station.

826
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:28,240
Um, and I had something else, but I don't remember, so. I want to eat. I want to go.

827
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:29,240
Okay.

828
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:31,240
I say we fuck the show.

829
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:33,240
Okay.

830
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:37,240
If we can make it through another half hour, I know we can, and we can get to two hours.

831
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:43,240
Actually, we do have a present for the last hour of the show, so we'll get to that later.

832
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:44,240
A gift.

833
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:45,240
We're making a gift.

834
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:46,240
We've made a gift.

835
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:47,240
We're making a gift.

836
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:48,240
Actually, Jamie made a gift.

837
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:52,240
Hey, if you look on my friend's page in my live journal, actually in one of the communities

838
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:55,240
I'm on, someone posted a really cool picture of Margaret Cho.

839
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,240
Really?

840
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:57,240
Yeah.

841
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:58,240
She's so cool.

842
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,240
It's in the Phycax community.

843
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:01,240
Let's get to Chatroom FUs, shall we?

844
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:05,240
FagHags community.

845
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:22,240
I'm looking because Puppey sent me an interesting FU. It involves a web link.

846
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:25,240
And he might have already deleted it.

847
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:29,680
He wants to give a big F.U. to somebody that posted something naughty in his girlfriend's

848
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:30,680
journal.

849
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:31,680
I'm loading that up.

850
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:32,680
We'll come back to his F.U.

851
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:33,680
Let's go to Zero's F.U.s.

852
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:36,800
Uh, F.U. to not being able to be there tonight.

853
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:37,800
Yeah, where's Zero?

854
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:38,800
We miss you.

855
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:42,560
F.U. to my legs giving out in the middle of Legend of Max all three times.

856
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:46,040
F.U. to my ass hurting as I fall to the ground on Legend of Max.

857
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:50,680
F.U. to stupid assholes who think because they live in my house I can fuck shit up.

858
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:54,280
Dark Sakura, I think we can use those boxes.

859
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:58,280
Stop trying to get people to buy your fucking alcohol, I think I will turn your stupid ass in.

860
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:02,280
Darkchild says, fuck you to the stupid 17 year old girl who keeps calling me.

861
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:06,280
Although it would have been smarter to have given her the wrong phone number.

862
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:11,280
Hey, you know what? I want to talk to her. Let me talk to her.

863
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:14,280
Better yet, let's talk to her live on air.

864
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:16,280
Get her number, I'll call her.

865
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:20,280
We'll find a way to tape the conversation.

866
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:27,280
Dark Tetsuya would like to say fuck not knowing what to do with crushes indeed and for Angel fuck having to work and missing the surprise.

867
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:35,280
I know what you mean a little bit, actually. I actually know what you mean very well.

868
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:43,280
Jon Fields would like to say F you two idiot that would try to make Metroid movie.

869
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:50,800
Nearly every movie based on game has failed even worse F you to Nintendo for allowing the movie the wizard from being made

870
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:53,900
Hey, the wizard rules hold on

871
01:18:55,420 --> 01:19:00,540
The wizard all those games are movies a double dragon you all sucked ass

872
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:06,340
Actually, I haven't seen the business. I guess I shouldn't judge it, but Resident Evil was probably the best

873
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:10,840
video game to movie production ever and if if

874
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:31,840
If they're going to start doing, because movie producers and directors are starting to notice this kind of stuff is becoming popular, like the comic book movies, the big budget comic book movies that are coming out, I think they're going to do pretty good with the Metroid movie. I'm hoping because, oh man, it would suck if Drew Barrymore was Samus or something. Oh my God.

875
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:02,840
Here you go.

876
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,840
Stop.

877
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:14,840
Stop.

878
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:22,720
The 23rd Magus will like to say F U to my screwy school schedule next week. Everyone

879
01:20:22,720 --> 01:20:26,940
else has to take their stupid little test, which leaves me in government class for five

880
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:34,140
hours with no bathroom passes. What the fuck? F U to Angel's screwy work schedule. F U to

881
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:38,620
having random DDRs at school begging me to take them to an Orange Lawns broadcast, which

882
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:47,140
I will do, so fear. Sure you will. Out. Brak2000 would like to say, F you to sore throats.

883
01:20:47,140 --> 01:21:00,100
Everything tastes like, um, sore throat. Chloraseptic is your friend. Okay, I'm going back to Puppy's

884
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:03,100
with the damn pages it's loading because LiveJournal is being a biznatch.

885
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:06,100
God damn it.

886
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:15,100
There we go.

887
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:21,100
Ah! God, it's the stupid tub girl thing. God damn it, why'd you have to show that?

888
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:26,100
I didn't even let the whole thing load. Like, 20 pixels of it came up,

889
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:36,820
up I recognize as being disgusting and I put it off stupid kids easy it's

890
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:43,460
Photoshop goat say was funny let me think of the Walmart that's on the

891
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:49,940
corner of our mission now Walmart Walgreens by the mall let me think of

892
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:54,940
I think it was about five minutes never.

893
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:04,940
Shame on you, puppy. Bad puppy.

894
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:07,940
That's me beating puppy with a newspaper.

895
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:10,940
Bad puppy.

896
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:13,940
It was just that fucking tub girl.

897
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:17,940
Gross.

898
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:18,940
I'm not hungry anymore.

899
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:22,020
thank you man

900
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:26,860
back you to black lab

901
01:22:26,860 --> 01:22:29,100
just

902
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:32,260
for dinner

903
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:35,420
right

904
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:39,500
i think that they can get some ongoing barbecue

905
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:42,880
you're mean

906
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:45,920
but he says it was more than that

907
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:47,840
uh... thank you

908
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:53,680
Don't. Oh, it's a twenty picture montage.

909
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:57,300
Alright, look away. Here's your chance.

910
01:22:57,300 --> 01:23:02,940
Of course, that means, like, everybody's watching now.

911
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:05,000
Who the hell did it?

912
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,300
Oh, it's gone.

913
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:07,640
Puppy deleted it.

914
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:09,900
Who the fuck did that anyway?

915
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:12,400
No, let me know who did it.

916
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:15,520
Save their IP. It was anonymous.

917
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:16,960
You can IP track them?

918
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:18,640
Yeah, you should log IPs.

919
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:22,640
Puppy, if you want to plot some revenge, get with Jamie.

920
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:24,260
I've done it. I have done it.

921
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:27,400
And there are ways you can trace somebody down to their zip code.

922
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:30,480
Find out where they live by their IP address.

923
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:34,160
Jamie's a geek.

924
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:35,840
In a good way.

925
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:42,840
That's how I knew who it was that it wasn't, um, you know, who spammed my live journal that it was his friend that did it.

926
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:13,840
coming into the chatroom.

927
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:14,840
We're live right now.

928
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:15,840
Well, we're live on Thursday.

929
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:16,840
Yeah, right now we're live.

930
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:17,840
If it's Thursday, we're live.

931
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:18,840
If it's Sunday, we're not.

932
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:19,840
Actually, no.

933
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,840
Because we rebroadcast.

934
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:21,840
The Thursday rebroadcast, usually.

935
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:22,840
Anyway, fuck it.

936
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:23,840
Whatever.

937
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:24,840
Fuck it.

938
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:25,840
Either we're live or we're not.

939
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,480
Just go to the chatroom and they'll tell you.

940
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:33,160
Go to calibumani.com, click on Orange Lounge, click on Chat.

941
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:34,160
While Rob chokes on something.

942
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:36,040
While I choke on something.

943
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:40,560
And in the meantime, let's play, let's play Usao-kun.

944
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:41,560
Let's play it the whole way through.

945
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:46,560
And we'll play some other stuff from Keyboard Mania, because Keyboard Mania is happy, fun, joy of dance.

946
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:15,440
I love her

947
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:18,600
I love what she gives you

948
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:20,980
Nice?

949
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:27,400
Bright Girl

950
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:30,840
Keep quiet

951
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:34,340
loved nerd

952
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:35,940
Girls, run

953
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:37,940
Kya!

954
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:46,940
Shondori Ustaku

955
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:53,940
Bikori Ustaku

956
01:25:57,940 --> 01:26:00,940
Ushikalandodela

957
01:26:00,940 --> 01:26:03,940
Inaneta Yoshi

958
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:05,940
I'm gonna be your mama

959
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:07,940
I'm gonna be your mama

960
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:09,940
I'm gonna be your mama

961
01:26:09,940 --> 01:26:11,940
Bye, bye, bye, bye.

962
01:28:09,940 --> 01:28:13,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah

963
01:28:17,940 --> 01:28:19,940
Think about it

964
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:21,940
We're long enough

965
01:28:21,940 --> 01:28:25,940
Reach out, buddy, feel the beat

966
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:29,940
Come on, wake up

967
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:32,940
Better get in charge of me

968
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:36,940
I need the back of your mother's smile

969
01:28:36,940 --> 01:28:40,940
But it burns so bright

970
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:42,940
Since we've done it all from out

971
01:28:42,940 --> 01:28:46,940
You'll be the star tonight

972
01:28:46,940 --> 01:28:47,940
Get with it

973
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:49,940
But at last

974
01:28:49,940 --> 01:28:51,940
You've gotta tell me

975
01:28:51,940 --> 01:28:52,940
You know it's too late

976
01:28:52,940 --> 01:28:54,940
When you're dead and I'm dead

977
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:56,940
Let it slip all right

978
01:28:56,940 --> 01:28:57,940
And set you strong

979
01:28:57,940 --> 01:28:59,940
But you don't make it sound

980
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:04,940
It's time to give you love

981
01:29:10,940 --> 01:29:14,940
Hey, hey, hey

982
01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:17,940
I just believe

983
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:21,940
You gotta feel it, yeah, yeah

984
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:28,940
Hello? Hello, is this thing on testing? Testing one, two?

985
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:40,340
I'm looking in the index but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

986
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:44,340
Hello? I don't understand this. Does this thing work?

987
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:46,340
This thing reads like stereo instructions. Is this on?

988
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:49,340
What the hell?

989
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:53,340
Orange Lounge Radio, broke down Get Opa Monte Radio.

990
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:55,340
What the f***?

991
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:58,340
And no better example of that than tonight, episode number 42.

992
01:29:58,340 --> 01:30:03,340
Do you get points if you can tell us where the beat came from?

993
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:07,340
They know, that's so easy. I know one person that's going to get that in two seconds.

994
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:10,340
Yeah, it's a nerd.

995
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:14,340
Yeah, tell us the answer and then we can tease you because you're a dork.

996
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:17,340
Yeah, that's what you win.

997
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:18,940
YOU'RE SO STUPID!

998
01:30:18,940 --> 01:30:20,140
I didn't hear it, so...

999
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:22,540
But I'm gonna guess it's the, uh, healing vision of Jellicans.

1000
01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:23,340
WRONG!

1001
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:25,340
WRONG, YOU'RE SO STUPID!

1002
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:27,340
Stupid American!

1003
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:29,340
It's easy, come on.

1004
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:31,340
**knocking**

1005
01:30:31,340 --> 01:30:33,340
Orange Lounge Radio.

1006
01:30:33,340 --> 01:30:35,340
Broke down Get Open Body Radio.

1007
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:37,340
WHAT THE F**K?

1008
01:30:39,340 --> 01:30:41,340
You couldn't hear it?

1009
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:43,340
**unintelligible**

1010
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:53,340
I thought you were talking about the backbeat, the QQQ music I thought you were talking about.

1011
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:54,340
Oh, the beep.

1012
01:30:54,340 --> 01:30:55,340
Yeah, oh, the beep.

1013
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:56,340
One more time.

1014
01:30:56,340 --> 01:30:57,340
What the f***?

1015
01:30:57,340 --> 01:31:06,340
Imagine a song where the tempo increases by one BPM every beat.

1016
01:31:06,340 --> 01:31:09,340
Oh, we just got it.

1017
01:31:09,340 --> 01:31:10,340
Okay, I'm gonna do that.

1018
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:13,340
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

1019
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:15,340
I'm spinning uncontrollably.

1020
01:31:15,340 --> 01:31:17,340
I feel like Dr. Evil.

1021
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:18,340
Alright.

1022
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:19,340
Don't vomit.

1023
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:22,340
Uh, what else do I want to talk about? Oh yeah, I know!

1024
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:24,340
We're gonna do our cage match.

1025
01:31:24,340 --> 01:31:25,340
We're gonna do a cage match?

1026
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:27,340
Yeah, remember I had my cell picked out because you have a new computer.

1027
01:31:27,340 --> 01:31:29,340
Oh, well shit. Okay, so we're gonna do a cage match.

1028
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:32,340
Loki agreed, his song sucks, so we're throwing it out and we're starting new.

1029
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:34,340
So we have a new cage match.

1030
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:37,340
And in this week's cage match, I have to dig a little bit for Jamie's song.

1031
01:31:37,340 --> 01:31:55,460
You know there's actually something about this one research group saying that bananas

1032
01:31:55,460 --> 01:32:04,000
as we know them are going to be extinct in a few years?

1033
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Why?

1034
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Because we bleed them, huh?

1035
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Why?

1036
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Because they stick them up their vaginas.

1037
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Why?

1038
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Because it would be really interesting if they're a man.

1039
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Why?

1040
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Because then they stick them up their ass.

1041
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Why?

1042
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
I don't know, Rob, you tell us.

1043
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Why?

1044
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Say something!

1045
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Something.

1046
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Rap? Okay.

1047
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,000
I am here and my name is Chaos.

1048
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Well, Jamie, you ought to introduce this.

1049
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Born to Bone, the sand bone trio.

1050
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
And what's it from?

1051
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,000
From Guitarman.

1052
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,000
And why do you like it?

1053
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
This is fucking rules.

1054
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Alright, here it is, the first entry of tonight's Sorens Off-Cage match.

1055
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:21,000
cage match born to be boned

1056
01:36:44,000 --> 01:37:00,320
Yay, it's the Mariachi Riffic.

1057
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:03,080
I was born to be Boned, the Sambone Trio.

1058
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:05,880
First song in tonight's Orange Launch Cage Match.

1059
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:07,880
What did you think of that one, Jamie?

1060
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:08,880
Nine.

1061
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:09,880
Why?

1062
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:13,600
Because it's cool.

1063
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:17,600
It's probably my favorite song on that whole soundtrack of guitar music, so I'm gonna give it a 9.

1064
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:24,600
Mmm, I like that song, but I think if it wins too many weeks in a row, I'm gonna get sick of it really fast.

1065
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:28,600
So, I'll give it a good score this week, but next week you get a crappy score.

1066
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:30,600
So this week it gets, uh, 8 and a half.

1067
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:33,600
Aw, son of a bitch.

1068
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:34,600
Uh oh.

1069
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:38,600
Oh, sorry, I just put in a CD that went to an extended CD.

1070
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:40,600
And this time I'm gonna let you read the track data either.

1071
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:42,600
Oh shit, it won't, huh?

1072
01:37:42,600 --> 01:38:06,600
I'm trying to pick my cage match song and we're kind of doing this live on air. I kind of ran out. I just changed my mind at the last minute about what I wanted to play. So I ran out to get it. I want to see if I can get this to go.

1073
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:07,840
0.

1074
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,200
0.

1075
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:10,680
Okay.

1076
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:15,880
Give me just one second, and I'm gonna get my two out.

1077
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:18,560
Okay, here we go.

1078
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:21,440
I think I got it, so I'm gonna make sure this broadcast...

1079
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:22,560
Okay, my pick.

1080
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:26,840
She got my F you of the week last week, but this week I'm putting her in the cage match

1081
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:31,440
because well, I don't think any song I put in stands a chance against Sambone Trio, so

1082
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:32,640
why not lose big?

1083
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:36,580
I'm gonna put in Madonna, and this is a brand new track from her new album, and it's not

1084
01:38:36,580 --> 01:38:39,460
American life elite single because you guys are probably worn out on that by

1085
01:38:39,460 --> 01:38:44,380
now but it's another track and to me the track is actually a bit beat nanny ish

1086
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:49,420
to me which is quite kind of why I like it it because it kind of progresses and

1087
01:38:49,420 --> 01:38:52,820
it's a little silly the lyrics are kind of silly but it's an interesting song I

1088
01:38:52,820 --> 01:38:56,100
think you guys might like it it's called mother and father and this is gonna be

1089
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:59,340
my case match pick for tonight and hopefully a place for you guys otherwise

1090
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:06,340
I'm gonna have to change it, so let's try it.

1091
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:39,340
There was a time that I prayed to Jesus Christ There was a time I had a mother, it was nice

1092
01:39:48,340 --> 01:39:57,340
Nobody else would ever take the place of you Nobody else would do the things that you could do

1093
01:39:57,340 --> 01:40:01,340
No one else I guess could hurt me like it did

1094
01:40:01,340 --> 01:40:06,340
I didn't understand, I was just a kid

1095
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:10,340
Oh mother why aren't you here with me

1096
01:40:10,340 --> 01:40:15,340
No one else saw things that you could see

1097
01:40:15,340 --> 01:40:19,340
I'm trying hard to dry my tears

1098
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:24,340
Yes father you know I'm not so free

1099
01:40:24,340 --> 01:40:29,100
I got to give it up Find someone to love me

1100
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:33,540
I got to let it go Find someone that I can care for

1101
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:37,900
I got to give it up Find someone to love me

1102
01:40:37,900 --> 01:40:42,860
I got to let it go Find someone that I can care for

1103
01:40:42,860 --> 01:41:01,100
There was a time I was happy in my life There was a time I believed I'd live forever

1104
01:41:01,100 --> 01:41:10,220
There was a time that I prayed to Jesus Christ There was a time I had a mother, it was nice

1105
01:41:10,220 --> 01:41:14,220
Oh mother, why aren't you here with me?

1106
01:41:14,220 --> 01:41:19,220
No one else saw the things that you could see

1107
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:23,220
I'm trying hard to dry my tears

1108
01:41:23,220 --> 01:41:28,220
Yes, father, you know I'm not so free

1109
01:41:28,220 --> 01:41:30,220
I got to give it up

1110
01:41:30,220 --> 01:41:32,220
Want someone to love me

1111
01:41:32,220 --> 01:41:34,220
I got to let it go

1112
01:41:34,220 --> 01:41:37,220
Want someone that I can care for

1113
01:41:37,220 --> 01:41:39,220
I got to give it up

1114
01:41:39,220 --> 01:41:43,220
Find someone to love me, I get to let it go

1115
01:41:43,220 --> 01:41:46,220
Find someone that I can care for

1116
01:41:46,220 --> 01:41:48,220
My mother died when I was five

1117
01:41:48,220 --> 01:41:50,220
And all I did was sit and cry

1118
01:41:50,220 --> 01:41:52,220
I cried and cried and cried all day

1119
01:41:52,220 --> 01:41:55,220
Until the neighbors went away

1120
01:41:55,220 --> 01:41:57,220
It couldn't take my loneliness, I couldn't take the phoniness

1121
01:41:59,220 --> 01:42:02,220
My father had to go to work, I used to think he was a jerk

1122
01:42:04,220 --> 01:42:06,220
I didn't know his heart was broken

1123
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:13,220
The word was spoken, he became a shadow of the father I was dreaming of

1124
01:42:13,220 --> 01:42:15,220
I made a vow that I would never need another person

1125
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:18,220
Never turned my heart into a cage, a victim of a kind of rage

1126
01:42:24,220 --> 01:42:26,220
I got to give it up

1127
01:42:26,220 --> 01:42:28,220
I got to give it up

1128
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:31,220
I'm someone denying me love

1129
01:42:31,220 --> 01:42:33,220
I got to let it go

1130
01:42:33,220 --> 01:42:35,220
I'm someone that I can't care for

1131
01:42:35,220 --> 01:42:37,220
I got to give it up

1132
01:42:37,220 --> 01:42:49,220
Find someone that I can care for

1133
01:42:49,220 --> 01:42:58,220
I got to give it up

1134
01:42:58,220 --> 01:43:02,220
I got to give it up

1135
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:07,220
I've got to let it go I've got to give it all

1136
01:43:07,220 --> 01:43:11,220
All my life All my life

1137
01:43:11,220 --> 01:43:17,220
And my heart says to give it up

1138
01:43:17,220 --> 01:43:42,260
That's it, that's Mother and Father by Madonna.

1139
01:43:42,260 --> 01:44:00,260
So let's get reaction from the room on mother and father by Madonna Brad since I haven't

1140
01:44:00,260 --> 01:44:06,620
heard really anything besides the single from the CD.

1141
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:11,500
I like the single better than this I guess I should compare it by itself.

1142
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:20,640
pretty good but it yeah I like it the reason why payments on you know what the

1143
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:24,000
more now that I'm listening to it in the context of this program that really was

1144
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:28,800
a shitty cage max pick because it doesn't stand very well on its own it

1145
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:33,700
really goes with the rest of the album but I like that song in relation to the

1146
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:38,640
rest of it because it's very quirky and it's got I don't know it just sounds

1147
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:47,400
very old-school Madonna to me I don't know I don't know what do you think Jamie

1148
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:51,400
should we let Brad put a song in or we just want you to tell what's the song

1149
01:44:51,400 --> 01:45:02,120
Brad well all right fine since nobody's gonna vote for that one I guess I don't

1150
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:05,120
I guess we have to give Sam Bone Trio a little competition.

1151
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:07,120
Let's see.

1152
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:09,120
Oh, Jesus.

1153
01:45:10,120 --> 01:45:11,120
Alright, this is a good song.

1154
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:14,120
Alright, what's the song that you're putting in? Is this an audio CD?

1155
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:17,120
Yeah, it's audio, so pull up the trackers because I need to see the trackers first.

1156
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:50,400
Alright, this is my love for deep fried chicken.

1157
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:54,480
We're honorarily letting Brad put a song in because Loki's not here, so enjoy.

1158
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:59,480
We're rolling. This is the good one. Take five.

1159
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:26,980
I was raised in a cardboard box

1160
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:28,480
And before when I was single

1161
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:29,980
Used to hear the chicken jingle

1162
01:46:29,980 --> 01:46:32,480
That's how I learned the chicken to rock

1163
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:34,480
When I'm in the mood to

1164
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:35,480
I got some other stuff

1165
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:37,980
And can't calm down to the fact

1166
01:46:37,980 --> 01:46:39,480
I'm the one in my room here

1167
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:40,480
Sipping down the hill

1168
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:43,480
I'm screaming out to get in the middle of the night

1169
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:45,980
Hey you, hey you

1170
01:46:45,980 --> 01:46:47,980
I'm thinking that you're so good

1171
01:46:47,980 --> 01:46:50,980
I'm thinking that you're so good

1172
01:46:50,980 --> 01:46:52,980
I'm thinking that you're so good

1173
01:47:22,980 --> 01:47:25,980
It's easy but you can't lose, you just can't stop

1174
01:47:25,980 --> 01:47:26,980
Oh, and I'm not a-workin'

1175
01:47:26,980 --> 01:47:27,980
I'm pushin' and I'm surgein'

1176
01:47:27,980 --> 01:47:30,980
And the boss is lookin' to tell me when

1177
01:47:30,980 --> 01:47:31,980
I go and hold the baby

1178
01:47:31,980 --> 01:47:32,980
Got my chicken, got me ready

1179
01:47:32,980 --> 01:47:35,980
And we do the diggin' dance with you

1180
01:47:35,980 --> 01:47:38,980
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

1181
01:47:38,980 --> 01:47:41,980
I'm thinkin' that nigga's so good

1182
01:47:41,980 --> 01:47:43,980
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

1183
01:47:43,980 --> 01:47:46,980
I'm thinkin' that nigga's so good

1184
01:47:46,980 --> 01:47:49,980
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

1185
01:47:49,980 --> 01:47:51,700
Singin' it with the doggo

1186
01:47:51,700 --> 01:47:54,940
Uh-huh, uh-huh-huh, uh-huh

1187
01:47:54,940 --> 01:47:56,960
I'll take it back and get it on

1188
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:58,260
I'll take it back and get it on

1189
01:48:03,260 --> 01:48:05,840
Candor and candor and candor and candor and

1190
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:07,200
Juicy, that's how you hear me

1191
01:48:08,200 --> 01:48:10,460
Do the popcorn chicken

1192
01:48:10,460 --> 01:48:13,480
Do the popcorn chicken

1193
01:48:13,480 --> 01:48:16,140
Do the KFC

1194
01:48:16,140 --> 01:48:18,820
Do the KFC

1195
01:48:18,820 --> 01:48:23,820
To the buffalo wings

1196
01:48:23,820 --> 01:48:28,820
Are you the pioneer?

1197
01:48:28,820 --> 01:48:29,820
Can you take it?

1198
01:48:29,820 --> 01:48:31,820
Yeah!

1199
01:48:31,820 --> 01:48:34,820
We got the chickens

1200
01:48:34,820 --> 01:48:36,820
Come on, get it up!

1201
01:48:36,820 --> 01:48:39,820
We got the chickens cut

1202
01:48:41,820 --> 01:48:45,820
Woohoo, I can't believe this

1203
01:49:15,820 --> 01:49:19,820
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu Neo

1204
01:49:19,820 --> 01:49:22,820
That chicken Hardware there so good

1205
01:49:22,820 --> 01:49:32,820
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

1206
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:40,820
That was the Aquabats with Magic Chicken

1207
01:49:40,820 --> 01:49:42,820
Uuuuuh Jamie what did you think of that

1208
01:49:42,820 --> 01:49:48,820
I like Ska, but I don't think that that would work as a cage match song.

1209
01:49:48,820 --> 01:49:50,820
As a song, it gets a 9.

1210
01:49:50,820 --> 01:49:53,820
As a cage match pick, it gets a 4.

1211
01:49:53,820 --> 01:49:55,820
Brad!

1212
01:49:55,820 --> 01:49:59,820
I have to agree, I wasn't trying to make it compete with anything.

1213
01:49:59,820 --> 01:50:03,820
I love the song, as a song, it gets a 10.

1214
01:50:03,820 --> 01:50:06,820
But cage match is crap.

1215
01:50:06,820 --> 01:50:09,820
So I wasn't trying, you know, that was just kind of a fuck up thing.

1216
01:50:09,820 --> 01:50:20,820
Before we go on to you, I want to ask something. What is a Cave Match song? Is Cave Match just BeatMania style stuff? Trans-techno-dancey stuff?

1217
01:50:20,820 --> 01:50:23,820
Songs that you'd want to hear regularly on Orange Wound's radio.

1218
01:50:23,820 --> 01:50:34,820
That's what is, OKC. I had it all wrong. Next time I'll make sure to get something good that you want to hear, like Eminem or something. Slick motherfuckers. Sorry.

1219
01:50:34,820 --> 01:50:41,820
Um, as for my opinions on the song, 11. Best cage match pick ever.

1220
01:50:41,820 --> 01:50:43,820
Yo, you asshole.

1221
01:50:43,820 --> 01:50:48,820
No, my favorite part of that song is when he's ratting off to different chicken places.

1222
01:50:48,820 --> 01:50:54,820
It's not bad. You know what, it's very Guitar Freaks. I can see it in Guitar Freaks, totally.

1223
01:50:54,820 --> 01:50:56,820
It sounds like you sang Pooh Pooh.

1224
01:50:56,820 --> 01:50:59,820
Yeah, whatever, whatever, 7, whatever.

1225
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:05,820
Okay, so your entries, your possible votes, and send those votes to Sky in the chatroom right now.

1226
01:51:05,820 --> 01:51:12,820
You can vote for the Sandbone Trio with Born to Be Bone, which is off a CD that's not it.

1227
01:51:12,820 --> 01:51:16,820
Okay, you don't get clips of the songs tonight. If you don't remember them, you suck.

1228
01:51:16,820 --> 01:51:23,820
So you get Born to Be Bone from the Sandbone Trio, the Aquabats with Magic Chicken, or Madonna with Mother and Father.

1229
01:51:23,820 --> 01:51:25,820
And not Duck Toy.

1230
01:51:25,820 --> 01:51:28,820
And not Ducktoy. If you vote for Ducktoy, you get kicked.

1231
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:34,820
So, send me your votes in the chatroom right now over a private message to Sky.

1232
01:51:34,820 --> 01:51:37,820
Unless it's Sunday, because we're pre-taped this week.

1233
01:51:37,820 --> 01:51:42,820
So if you know the super-secret time that we're taping, send them right now.

1234
01:51:43,820 --> 01:51:48,820
If you're in the chatroom right now, I actually want to hold off just really fast.

1235
01:51:48,820 --> 01:51:53,820
I want to get one more news story out in the open before we go to a break.

1236
01:51:53,820 --> 01:51:55,180
Rob has a confession.

1237
01:51:55,180 --> 01:51:56,540
I have a confession to make.

1238
01:51:56,540 --> 01:52:00,180
I am homo sapien.

1239
01:52:00,180 --> 01:52:02,220
OK.

1240
01:52:02,220 --> 01:52:04,460
I don't know if you guys have heard about this yet, but have

1241
01:52:04,460 --> 01:52:07,340
you ever been to those sites, Petition Online, like where

1242
01:52:07,340 --> 01:52:08,700
you can sign petitions?

1243
01:52:08,700 --> 01:52:10,260
And no one really gives a fuck about them?

1244
01:52:10,260 --> 01:52:11,540
No one really cares.

1245
01:52:11,540 --> 01:52:14,100
Like they had a petition to save Frenchie on American Idol

1246
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:16,020
that got like 500,000 signatures.

1247
01:52:16,020 --> 01:52:17,500
You didn't do shit.

1248
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:21,700
Well, somebody decided, well, maybe we can get petitions to

1249
01:52:21,700 --> 01:52:22,420
work for once.

1250
01:52:22,420 --> 01:52:27,100
We're going to petition for Konami of Japan to release a new version of BeatMania 2DX

1251
01:52:27,100 --> 01:52:28,100
to the consumer.

1252
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:31,100
However, there's a catch to this petition.

1253
01:52:31,100 --> 01:52:32,100
I'll read this.

1254
01:52:32,100 --> 01:52:36,160
This is a petition asking Konami for a new release of BeatMania 2DX, preferably seventh

1255
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:38,640
style for the Japanese PlayStation 2 console.

1256
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:42,080
For all fans who are looking forward to a new mix, please sign this petition, as it

1257
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:47,980
will be sent directly to Konami of Japan, either KCEJ or Konami Toyo.

1258
01:52:47,980 --> 01:52:52,800
This is not a solo project and is part of a larger petition with major Japanese Bimani

1259
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:54,140
fan site.

1260
01:52:54,140 --> 01:52:58,560
Any comments you add will be translated into Japanese and sent along with your name to

1261
01:52:58,560 --> 01:52:59,560
Konami.

1262
01:52:59,560 --> 01:53:01,980
That's kind of the catch.

1263
01:53:01,980 --> 01:53:03,900
Thank you for supporting this petition.

1264
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:09,500
So if you want to go sign this petition, I'll post the link in the chat room right now and

1265
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:12,980
hopefully somebody will be kind enough to repaste it at this point in the show on Sunday

1266
01:53:12,980 --> 01:53:13,980
when it rebroadcasts.

1267
01:53:13,980 --> 01:53:24,100
But the website for this petition is petitiononline.com slash new2dx, but that's the number 2, not

1268
01:53:24,100 --> 01:53:26,160
II, as you usually see it.

1269
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:32,660
So it's petitiononline.com slash NEW, the number 2, DX.

1270
01:53:32,660 --> 01:53:37,220
So you can go sign that petition, and right now, there's quite a few.

1271
01:53:37,220 --> 01:53:40,980
You've got 98 signatures on it so far, so not too bad.

1272
01:53:40,980 --> 01:53:42,260
So you can go sign that right now.

1273
01:53:42,260 --> 01:53:47,660
You'll be lucky 100 quick get in there right now. Okay, so that's what you can sign if you want to

1274
01:53:48,340 --> 01:53:50,340
Petition for seventh style. What do you think of that? Jamie?

1275
01:53:51,860 --> 01:53:53,860
What can it hurt, right?

1276
01:53:54,820 --> 01:53:57,860
So this would be five whole seconds of my life I can never get back

1277
01:53:58,580 --> 01:54:02,980
So after the break, we're gonna come back and yes for seven style after the break

1278
01:54:02,980 --> 01:54:05,460
We're gonna come back and we're going to

1279
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:09,740
Announce a match winner and we're gonna club baby seals

1280
01:54:09,740 --> 01:54:17,540
we're gonna have hot monkey sex and then we're gonna do a different last hour of

1281
01:54:17,540 --> 01:54:21,940
the show then you'll wake up on an island with these shiny new necklaces

1282
01:54:21,940 --> 01:54:27,620
and we'll explain what's gonna happen when we come back and I've got a queue

1283
01:54:27,620 --> 01:54:34,780
up a break though so I'll break something Jamie give us a deep thought

1284
01:54:34,780 --> 01:54:38,780
Sometimes I like to kick people in the nuts.

1285
01:55:04,780 --> 01:55:07,780
We're not going to have monkey sex. We'll start with drunk monkey instead.

1286
01:55:07,780 --> 01:55:09,780
We'll be back. You're listening to Orange Lawn Radio.

1287
01:56:37,780 --> 01:56:58,780
Bye, bye, bye, bye

1288
01:57:58,780 --> 01:58:25,780
No more will I wait, I've got to make a move

1289
01:58:25,780 --> 01:58:27,780
You never did me wrong

1290
01:58:27,780 --> 01:58:29,780
If you knew how I feel

1291
01:58:29,780 --> 01:58:31,780
Baby, can't you see?

1292
01:58:31,780 --> 01:58:34,780
To make you mind my heart

1293
01:58:34,780 --> 01:58:37,780
I found things upside down

1294
01:58:39,780 --> 01:58:41,780
How's you for you?

1295
01:58:42,780 --> 01:58:46,780
Why don't you love me?

1296
01:58:48,780 --> 01:58:51,780
Why don't you know how I think you feel?

1297
01:58:51,780 --> 01:58:53,780
All I'm missing

1298
01:58:53,780 --> 01:58:55,780
Love me

1299
01:58:55,780 --> 01:58:56,780
When you're quickin'

1300
01:58:56,780 --> 01:58:58,780
When you're clippin' and shakin'

1301
01:58:58,780 --> 01:58:59,780
I've been too long

1302
01:58:59,780 --> 01:59:00,780
I've stabbed my teeth

1303
01:59:00,780 --> 01:59:01,780
And now I wanna catch you

1304
01:59:01,780 --> 01:59:02,780
And make you yell

1305
01:59:02,780 --> 01:59:06,780
Love me

1306
01:59:06,780 --> 01:59:09,780
You're the city

1307
01:59:09,780 --> 01:59:13,780
Again I'm with you

1308
01:59:13,780 --> 01:59:17,780
In a moment of loss

1309
01:59:17,780 --> 01:59:20,780
Last year we're counting down

1310
01:59:20,780 --> 01:59:23,420
Did you really love me?

1311
01:59:23,420 --> 01:59:27,420
Did you hold me tight?

1312
01:59:27,420 --> 01:59:29,420
No more withering

1313
01:59:29,420 --> 01:59:31,420
I've got to make a move

1314
01:59:31,420 --> 01:59:33,420
You will never make me wrong

1315
01:59:33,420 --> 01:59:37,420
If you knew how I did it, baby

1316
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:39,420
Can't you see?

1317
01:59:39,420 --> 01:59:41,420
To make you find the mark

1318
01:59:41,420 --> 01:59:45,420
I fell on things upside down

1319
01:59:45,420 --> 01:59:49,420
I'm here for you

1320
01:59:49,420 --> 01:59:56,420
why

1321
01:59:57,620 --> 02:00:01,140
the

1322
02:00:01,140 --> 02:00:04,140
hello are you are listening or radio

1323
02:00:04,140 --> 02:00:08,540
we and tonight's age-match winner is

1324
02:00:08,540 --> 02:00:11,300
big freaking surprise

1325
02:00:11,300 --> 02:00:15,580
it's not that song it's the sam bone trio yay one

1326
02:00:15,580 --> 02:00:17,460
big surprise

1327
02:00:17,460 --> 02:00:19,460
All right, so that's tonight's Big Cage Mesh winner.

1328
02:00:19,460 --> 02:00:22,660
Now we have an extra special treat for this evening.

1329
02:00:22,660 --> 02:00:24,900
As you may or may not know, sometimes on the station when

1330
02:00:24,900 --> 02:00:27,180
we're bored, we'll do a fuck-off show.

1331
02:00:27,180 --> 02:00:31,060
So Jamie did one of these the other night, last night, right?

1332
02:00:31,060 --> 02:00:33,420
Usually it's just me putting in a random comment and then

1333
02:00:33,420 --> 02:00:34,740
playing five hours of music.

1334
02:00:34,740 --> 02:00:37,100
And since we don't have a whole lot else to talk about

1335
02:00:37,100 --> 02:00:39,760
tonight, we thought we'd treat you with an hour clip of one

1336
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:40,740
of these fuck-off shows.

1337
02:00:40,740 --> 02:00:41,980
And it was fun, wasn't it, Jamie?

1338
02:00:41,980 --> 02:00:45,180
Yeah, the theme of my fuck-off last night was stupid laws.

1339
02:00:45,180 --> 02:00:46,500
Stupid laws.

1340
02:00:46,500 --> 02:00:49,600
so that's going to take you out the last hour tonight show

1341
02:00:49,600 --> 02:00:52,980
and then uh... it's all done you guys but before that

1342
02:00:52,980 --> 02:00:54,740
yes

1343
02:00:54,740 --> 02:01:00,220
already that we're going to do the outro of the show first and then go into that

1344
02:01:00,220 --> 02:01:07,220
just do the fortune cookie okay

1345
02:01:07,220 --> 02:01:09,280
all right here it is so this is it this is

1346
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:14,240
this is the normal fortune cookie for tonight here we go

1347
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:15,960
car theft is on the rise

1348
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:19,560
In America, a car is stolen every 12 seconds.

1349
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:21,640
What can you do to protect your car?

1350
02:01:21,640 --> 02:01:24,360
An expensive car alarm system won't protect your car

1351
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:25,760
from being stolen.

1352
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:29,000
The club won't protect the valuables inside your car.

1353
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,560
But a big black guy named Ben can.

1354
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:34,280
Get away from the car, motherfucker.

1355
02:01:34,280 --> 02:01:37,040
For less than you'd pay for an expensive car alarm system,

1356
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:39,240
and even less than you'd pay for the club,

1357
02:01:39,240 --> 02:01:41,560
you can get a big black guy named Ben

1358
02:01:41,560 --> 02:01:43,200
to protect your automobile.

1359
02:01:43,200 --> 02:01:46,040
Get away from the car, motherfucker.

1360
02:01:46,040 --> 02:01:47,400
It's simple to use.

1361
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:49,920
Just leave the big black guy named Ben in your car

1362
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:52,760
whenever you get out, and he does the rest.

1363
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:54,960
Whenever anyone gets within six feet of your car,

1364
02:01:54,960 --> 02:01:57,480
Ben simply gets out of the car and tells them.

1365
02:01:57,480 --> 02:02:00,080
Get away from the car, motherfucker.

1366
02:02:00,080 --> 02:02:02,120
Listen to these testimonials from people

1367
02:02:02,120 --> 02:02:04,640
who use a big black guy named Ben.

1368
02:02:04,640 --> 02:02:06,720
It's always nice to have someone to ride with,

1369
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:08,640
although he really doesn't say much.

1370
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:12,480
Just get away from the car, motherfucker.

1371
02:02:12,480 --> 02:02:13,800
That's about it.

1372
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:16,440
I didn't get a big black guy named Ben to chat with.

1373
02:02:16,440 --> 02:02:18,240
I got him to protect my car.

1374
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:21,260
It's the best investment I've ever made.

1375
02:02:21,260 --> 02:02:22,960
My neighborhood isn't that great.

1376
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:24,640
There have been a lot of car theft.

1377
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:26,760
I can't tell you how many times I've heard it.

1378
02:02:26,760 --> 02:02:29,000
Get away from the car, motherfucker.

1379
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,520
Knowing that I've got a big black guy named Ben protecting

1380
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:33,640
my car lets me sleep better at night.

1381
02:02:33,640 --> 02:02:36,480
Call now 1-800-1-BIG-GUY.

1382
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:41,360
That's 1-800-1-B-I-G-G-U-Y. And instead of hearing this.

1383
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:45,160
You'll hear this.

1384
02:02:45,160 --> 02:02:50,560
Get away from the car, motherfucker.

1385
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:52,840
Alright so, that's it.

1386
02:02:52,840 --> 02:02:53,840
Goodnight you guys.

1387
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:55,940
Get away from the car, motherfucker.

1388
02:02:55,940 --> 02:03:00,600
We're going to the tape bit now and so enjoy the next hour and thanks for joining us on

1389
02:03:00,600 --> 02:03:04,260
this very special edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

1390
02:03:04,260 --> 02:03:05,260
Final thought, Jamie?

1391
02:03:05,260 --> 02:03:07,860
Um, you get to listen to how bad I snuck last night.

1392
02:03:07,860 --> 02:03:11,280
Final thought, guys?

1393
02:03:11,280 --> 02:03:15,280
Evan, final thought!

1394
02:03:15,280 --> 02:03:17,280
What is the sound of cheese in the morning?

1395
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:18,280
Is it you?

1396
02:03:18,280 --> 02:03:22,280
Or is it what you want to be?

1397
02:03:22,280 --> 02:03:24,280
And my final thought is...

1398
02:03:24,280 --> 02:03:25,280
PUSSY!

1399
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:26,280

1429
02:18:11,420 --> 02:18:15,420

1430
02:18:15,420 --> 02:18:19,420

1434
02:18:31,420 --> 02:18:35,420
playing

1435
02:18:35,420 --> 02:18:39,420
playing

1436
02:19:09,420 --> 02:19:11,420
Oh

1437
02:20:09,420 --> 02:20:11,420
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

1438
02:20:39,420 --> 02:20:40,420
Boom!

1439
02:26:10,420 --> 02:26:39,620
This is the way we dance, This is the way we rock,

1440
02:26:39,620 --> 02:26:44,220
This is the way we vibe, as we demonstrate, as we demonstrate

1441
02:26:44,220 --> 02:26:46,000
Do you know what it was? A piece of pie?

1442
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:47,680
Don't tell me that means that I

1443
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:49,340
Toss a rose and I cover the eye, doing the vibe

1444
02:26:49,340 --> 02:26:51,100
Cause I spy, he means fly

1445
02:26:51,100 --> 02:26:53,720

This is the sound

1449
02:27:19,720 --> 02:27:20,720
Everybody wants a piece of the pie

1450
02:27:50,720 --> 02:27:55,520
Yeah, here comes the playback, you know how we do

1451
02:27:55,520 --> 02:27:58,720
And you play in this area, get down

1452
02:27:58,720 --> 02:28:02,220
Hit the beat, don't give up the fight, hit the drop

1453
02:28:02,220 --> 02:28:05,720
Still up, hit the beat in the air, hit the play floor

1454
02:28:05,720 --> 02:28:09,220
Get up, hit the beat, you can be the shadow behind

1455
02:28:09,220 --> 02:28:11,720
If you're down double, you're gonna be blind

1456
02:28:11,720 --> 02:28:14,220
Like your enemy, you play like a fool

1457
02:28:14,220 --> 02:28:17,220
It's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool

1458
02:29:47,220 --> 02:29:51,720
If you knew better, maybe you would have had it, why better?

1459
02:29:51,720 --> 02:29:57,720
It's truly your magic, under the moonlight

1460
02:29:57,720 --> 02:30:03,720
Love is like a body, we don't love what we are, don't you mind?

1461
02:30:03,720 --> 02:30:10,220
Do a nest and just move to the tail, the bird is watching me

1462
02:30:10,220 --> 02:30:14,220
Monkey dance, monkey dance, make you stop

1463
02:30:14,220 --> 02:30:17,720
Shake your body down, sleep on the monkey down

1464
02:30:17,720 --> 02:30:22,220
Let's get together, on the floor, yeah, baby

1465
02:30:22,220 --> 02:30:26,720
Monkey dance, monkey dance, let me share

1466
02:30:26,720 --> 02:30:29,720
Move your body down, sleep on the monkey dance

1467
02:30:29,720 --> 02:30:35,720
Look at them, tell them to the rest of you to die!

1468
02:31:05,720 --> 02:31:21,720
The coldest common air's on the mountain top The coldest monkey that ever hoped

1469
02:31:21,720 --> 02:31:25,720
He knew that every magic train would wander the sun

1470
02:31:25,720 --> 02:31:29,720
He'd forgotten everyone and had some fun

1471
02:31:29,720 --> 02:31:37,720
Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic

1472
02:31:41,720 --> 02:31:48,720
There's a little, little monkey magic Just about to touch the mountain

1473
02:31:48,720 --> 02:31:53,720
And I'll never let a monkey die

1474
02:31:53,720 --> 02:31:56,720
Better let the monkey die

1475
02:32:00,720 --> 02:32:04,720
Born from an egg on a mountain top

1476
02:32:04,720 --> 02:32:08,720
The punkiest monkey that ever was

1477
02:32:08,720 --> 02:32:12,720
He knew every last thing under the sun

1478
02:32:12,720 --> 02:32:17,720
He'd cheat the gods and everyone had some fun

1479
02:32:17,720 --> 02:32:34,720
Get monkey magic, get monkey magic

1480
02:33:17,720 --> 02:33:21,220
You're my duty, you're my calling to death

1481
02:33:21,220 --> 02:33:23,220
I'm not a star, I'm a star

1482
02:33:23,220 --> 02:33:26,220
If you wanted to think that you're a star

1483
02:33:26,220 --> 02:33:29,220
You're a city, I'm not a fan

1484
02:33:29,220 --> 02:33:32,220
If you wanted to, you're a highly-known

1485
02:33:32,220 --> 02:33:35,220
People, they won't give you

1486
02:33:35,220 --> 02:33:37,220
My only thing to love

1487
02:33:37,220 --> 02:33:39,220
My only thing to love

1488
02:33:39,220 --> 02:33:41,720
What do you write a song for?

1489
02:33:41,720 --> 02:33:45,220
I don't mind, don't need to talk to me

1490
02:34:15,220 --> 02:34:20,220
Go live!

1491
02:34:20,220 --> 02:34:25,220
Go live!

1492
02:34:25,220 --> 02:34:49,220
Before there were words, communication was done through feet.

1493
02:34:49,220 --> 02:34:53,220
Body language is controlled by rhythm.

1494
02:34:53,220 --> 02:34:55,220
Think it's a universal link

1495
02:34:55,220 --> 02:34:57,220
Feel this, feel me

1496
02:34:57,220 --> 02:34:59,220
Huh, huh

1497
02:34:59,220 --> 02:35:01,220
Think of this world without sound

1498
02:35:01,220 --> 02:35:03,220
Can't even feel a heart pound

1499
02:35:03,220 --> 02:35:05,220
Wasting time, wasting lives, wasting self

1500
02:35:05,220 --> 02:35:07,220
You're a big help

1501
02:35:07,220 --> 02:35:09,220
You play me a drum and I'll beat on it

1502
02:35:09,220 --> 02:35:11,220
Place the guitar, I'll trade

1503
02:35:11,220 --> 02:35:13,220

1668
03:08:39,600 --> 03:08:42,600
I'll be going forward and things are getting worse

1669
03:08:48,600 --> 03:08:53,600
You cannot change the laws of physics

1670
03:08:53,600 --> 03:08:54,600
Are we coming?

1671
03:08:54,600 --> 03:08:56,600
Please shoot to kill, shoot to kill, shoot to kill

1672
03:08:56,600 --> 03:08:59,600
We're coming, please shoot to kill, Scotty, bring me up, bitch

1673
03:08:59,600 --> 03:09:01,600
Worse than that, eat that, Jim

1674
03:09:31,600 --> 03:10:00,600
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

1675
03:10:01,600 --> 03:10:08,600
So many nights we end up as computer stars

1676
03:10:08,600 --> 03:10:17,600
And you believe in your life that she, she had it all set

1677
03:10:17,600 --> 03:10:20,600
With you, with you, with you

1678
03:10:20,600 --> 03:10:23,600
They know you just can't stop

1679
03:10:23,600 --> 03:10:27,600
I wanna be with you, with you, with you

1680
03:10:27,600 --> 03:10:29,600
Wherever you are

1681
03:10:29,600 --> 03:10:35,600
You see you've been my heart Why do we speak out loud like this?

1682
03:10:35,600 --> 03:10:43,600
I'd like to share the rhythm of a talking How can I keep repeating the same old lies?

1683
03:10:43,600 --> 03:10:49,600
You and I, we've had this together Why do we speak out loud like this?

1684
03:10:49,600 --> 03:10:57,600
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you How do we know we'll be together?

1685
03:10:57,600 --> 03:11:00,600
I'll always do it this way, man

1686
03:11:02,600 --> 03:11:08,600
My love won't do nothing to you

1687
03:11:09,600 --> 03:11:16,600
And then I'm gonna make her be the one

1688
03:11:46,600 --> 03:12:03,600
So many days we wasted under the sky, watching the sun go up and the compilers came.

1689
03:12:03,600 --> 03:12:10,600
So many nights we ended up completed stars.

1690
03:12:10,600 --> 03:12:16,100
And you really are like that, she, she held me the same day

1691
03:12:16,100 --> 03:12:19,100
With you, with you, with you

1692
03:12:19,100 --> 03:12:22,600
The universe is on its side

1693
03:12:22,600 --> 03:12:26,600
I wanna be with you, with you, with you

1694
03:12:26,600 --> 03:12:30,600
Wherever you are, you see you in my eyes

1695
03:12:30,600 --> 03:12:34,100
Why do we sit down like this?

1696
03:12:34,100 --> 03:12:37,600
I like to share the little more I told you

1697
03:12:37,600 --> 03:12:41,600
How can I keep repeating the same old lies?

1698
03:12:41,600 --> 03:12:44,600
You and I, we've ever seen this on you

1699
03:12:44,600 --> 03:12:48,600
Why do we stick around like this?

1700
03:12:48,600 --> 03:12:51,600
I won't expect the rest of my life to do

1701
03:12:51,600 --> 03:12:55,600
Why do we know we'll be together?

1702
03:12:55,600 --> 03:13:00,600
I wanna do it this way, man

1703
03:13:00,600 --> 03:13:07,600
Man and woman do nothing to you

1704
03:13:07,600 --> 03:13:15,600
Man and woman make up in the wild

1705
03:13:15,600 --> 03:13:20,600
So many moments ago

1706
03:14:20,600 --> 03:14:35,600
Just make a real moment

1707
03:14:35,600 --> 03:14:44,600
Just make a real moment

1708
03:14:44,600 --> 03:14:46,600

1731
03:20:39,120 --> 03:21:07,120
Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Can you hear what I'm saying?

1732
03:21:07,120 --> 03:21:10,120
Load it down the ticket man, they want you back

03:21:10,120 --> 03:21:14,120
I'm gonna kick your ass, beat them, kill them all

1734
03:21:14,120 --> 03:21:23,120
Down, what am I gonna do?

1735
03:21:23,120 --> 03:21:26,120
Have you ever think of them like this?

1736
03:21:26,120 --> 03:21:28,120
And I'll see you in the next video!

1737
03:23:26,120 --> 03:23:42,120
I need this all the way, I need this all the way, I need this all the way, more than that

1738
03:24:56,120 --> 03:24:58,120

1749
03:26:56,980 --> 03:26:57,980

1750
03:26:57,980 --> 03:26:58,480
I-

1751
03:26:58,480 --> 03:26:58,980
I-

1752
03:26:58,980 --> 03:26:59,480
I-

1753
03:26:59,480 --> 03:26:59,980
I'm Beat!

1754
03:27:00,180 --> 03:27:03,080
Another day in my work is all done

1755
03:27:03,080 --> 03:27:06,440
I can leave all my cares behind now

1756
03:27:07,200 --> 03:27:10,000
I'm out to play I'm gonna have me some fun

1757
03:27:10,000 --> 03:27:13,000
In a world that is totally mine

1758
03:27:23,000 --> 03:27:26,000
I'm gonna fall, feel myself run out of light

1759
03:27:26,000 --> 03:27:29,000
No, they just can't take your fear

1760
03:27:30,000 --> 03:27:33,000
I will turn it over, I'll feel it inside

1761
03:27:33,000 --> 03:27:36,000
Feel my head come to my feet

1762
03:27:36,000 --> 03:27:41,000
My life ends up being a long, dark, life

1763
03:27:41,000 --> 03:27:44,000
Naturalize me with no fear

1764
03:27:44,000 --> 03:27:48,000
As the morning happens, I'm doing this live

1765
03:27:48,000 --> 03:27:51,240
I blow my heart down to my knees

1766
03:29:48,000 --> 03:30:15,360
This is the way we dance, this is the way we rock, this is the way we vibe

1767
03:30:15,360 --> 03:30:18,360
As we demonstrate, as we demonstrate, straight

1768
03:30:18,360 --> 03:30:20,360
Everybody wants a piece of the pie

1769
03:30:20,360 --> 03:30:21,360
Pots, amigos, miso, ah

1770
03:30:21,360 --> 03:30:23,360
Cosas, rosas, la gabe de ador, the fight

1771
03:30:23,360 --> 03:30:25,360
Cos I spy, let me fly

1772
03:30:25,360 --> 03:30:26,360
This is the way we dance

1773
03:30:26,360 --> 03:30:28,360
This is the way we rock

1774
03:30:28,360 --> 03:30:29,360
This is the way we ride

1775
03:30:29,360 --> 03:30:32,360
As we demonstrate, as we demonstrate

1776
03:30:49,360 --> 03:30:50,360
This is the sound

1777
03:30:52,360 --> 03:30:53,360
This is the sound

1778
03:30:54,360 --> 03:30:55,360
Everybody wants a piece of the pie

1779
03:30:55,360 --> 03:30:57,360
Pulsing me that means the eye

1780
03:32:57,360 --> 03:33:02,360
with a series of unintended threats to be more microphone and pepper.

1781
03:33:27,360 --> 03:33:42,360
Get up in the mornin' it's a crack and a thong You also like your house all day

1782
03:33:42,360 --> 03:33:52,360
You think that a man has to do for a livin' That we keep the reaper away

1783
03:33:52,360 --> 03:33:54,760
Things that a man has to do for a living

1784
03:33:54,760 --> 03:33:56,860
Have to keep the reaper away

1785
03:33:57,360 --> 03:33:59,360
Somebody give me a break

1786
03:33:59,360 --> 03:34:01,860
I've had a bunch that nobody can take

1787
03:34:01,860 --> 03:34:03,360
Nobody did you

1788
03:34:03,360 --> 03:34:04,360
Nobody sees you

1789
03:34:04,360 --> 03:34:07,360
Nobody ever breaks free from life

1790
03:34:10,860 --> 03:34:13,360
Bad city, bad, bad city

1791
03:34:13,360 --> 03:34:15,360
Bad city, bad

1792
03:34:15,360 --> 03:34:17,860
Bad city, bad, bad city

1793
03:34:17,860 --> 03:34:20,360
Bad city, bad

1794
03:35:20,360 --> 03:35:30,360
We should gather around the yard We should gather around the corner

1795
03:35:30,360 --> 03:35:40,360
We took a crucial road And we never dreamed so

1796
03:35:40,360 --> 03:35:42,360
Oh

1797
03:37:10,360 --> 03:37:15,360
a

1798
03:37:15,360 --> 03:37:20,360
a

1799
03:37:20,360 --> 03:37:25,360
a

1800
03:37:25,360 --> 03:37:30,360
a

1801
03:37:30,360 --> 03:37:35,360
a

1802
03:37:35,360 --> 03:37:50,360
Give me your love, give it to me, give me that good love

1803
03:37:50,360 --> 03:37:54,360
Baby, give me your love, I'm the one who should give you love

1804
03:37:54,360 --> 03:37:58,360
I'm looking to be dead through the dawn

1805
03:37:59,360 --> 03:38:01,360
Can you clearly see?

1806
03:38:01,360 --> 03:38:03,360
I could give you more than time

1807
03:38:04,360 --> 03:38:08,360
You call me friend but you can't most believe

1808
03:38:09,360 --> 03:38:11,360
I want to live

1809
03:38:11,360 --> 03:38:13,360
There is more to me

1810
03:38:14,360 --> 03:38:16,360
When late at night

1811
03:38:16,360 --> 03:38:18,660
You're all I need
