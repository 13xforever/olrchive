1
00:00:00,249 --> 00:00:02,713
[SPEAKER_20]: Message for you, son!

2
00:00:03,113 --> 00:00:03,935
Attention!

3
00:00:05,016 --> 00:00:08,481
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

4
00:00:10,504 --> 00:00:15,571
[SPEAKER_03]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

5
00:00:19,188 --> 00:00:21,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge may contain adult cunt.

6
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:25,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

7
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

8
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:32,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

9
00:00:32,872 --> 00:00:33,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kidding.

10
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

11
00:00:35,293 --> 00:00:42,775
[SPEAKER_20]: In this episode... Hey, are there any balls down there?

12
00:00:43,015 --> 00:00:45,496
[SPEAKER_25]: That's the biggest berry you've ever seen, Jingleberry.

13
00:00:45,576 --> 00:00:46,896
[SPEAKER_25]: What's your favorite sugar?

14
00:00:48,737 --> 00:00:49,317
[SPEAKER_26]: Showgirls.

15
00:00:50,218 --> 00:00:51,338
[SPEAKER_26]: Absolutely frightful.

16
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:52,319
[SPEAKER_26]: What's yours?

17
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:54,920
[SPEAKER_26]: There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

18
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,181
[SPEAKER_26]: Don't torture yourself.

19
00:00:56,861 --> 00:00:57,662
[SPEAKER_25]: That's my job.

20
00:00:57,802 --> 00:00:59,783
[SPEAKER_25]: Now's the time on sprockets, baby dogs!

21
00:00:59,863 --> 00:01:02,764
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll get you, my pretty.

22
00:01:02,904 --> 00:01:04,285
[SPEAKER_20]: And your little dog, too.

23
00:01:04,705 --> 00:01:05,526
[SPEAKER_26]: I know Kung Fu.

24
00:01:06,006 --> 00:01:08,347
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

25
00:01:08,627 --> 00:01:10,448
[SPEAKER_26]: Why did they have to take the word gay?

26
00:01:12,089 --> 00:01:12,689
[SPEAKER_20]: No!

27
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:15,851
[SPEAKER_20]: What I expect from Spanish exposition is gender.

28
00:01:15,911 --> 00:01:16,171
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey!

29
00:01:18,683 --> 00:01:20,504
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Shut up!

30
00:01:20,684 --> 00:01:21,384
[SPEAKER_14]: Where's my gun?

31
00:01:21,484 --> 00:01:23,845
[SPEAKER_14]: This is my boomstick!

32
00:01:23,905 --> 00:01:26,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Sky, Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!

33
00:01:26,726 --> 00:01:30,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.

34
00:01:30,527 --> 00:01:33,328
[SPEAKER_20]: What kind of warping being would find that funny?

35
00:01:33,548 --> 00:01:41,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio We are live, but not really.

36
00:01:41,551 --> 00:01:43,592
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is episode number 42 for April the 27th of 2003.

37
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,181
[SPEAKER_08]: You're tuned into the Bomani Scene's most premeditated radio station of all things, the money.

38
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:55,202
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

39
00:01:55,942 --> 00:02:00,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

40
00:02:01,744 --> 00:02:02,945
[SPEAKER_08]: You know her better as DarkSakra.

41
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:05,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Or tonight, as her name tag says, Miss Pac-Man.

42
00:02:09,307 --> 00:02:10,487
[SPEAKER_08]: I like your shirt, that's a cool shirt.

43
00:02:11,308 --> 00:02:11,688
[SPEAKER_08]: It's retro.

44
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:11,908
[SPEAKER_08]: It's retro.

45
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:18,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, Loki is out today because he's doing stuff.

46
00:02:19,104 --> 00:02:20,324
[SPEAKER_13]: He broke his track record again.

47
00:02:20,665 --> 00:02:21,745
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, it's amazing.

48
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:24,366
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what he's doing tonight, he's just doing stuff.

49
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:27,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he's fepping.

50
00:02:29,369 --> 00:02:30,469
[SPEAKER_08]: He's pecking and fepping.

51
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, actually, we have a secret.

52
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:35,772
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not really live tonight.

53
00:02:36,512 --> 00:02:37,453
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we're really dead.

54
00:02:38,013 --> 00:02:38,634
[SPEAKER_08]: We're actually...

55
00:02:40,084 --> 00:02:41,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless it's Thursday for you right now.

56
00:02:41,947 --> 00:02:47,473
[SPEAKER_08]: If it is Thursday the 24th, then yes, we're live.

57
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we're premature this week.

58
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:54,902
[SPEAKER_08]: We came a little early this week to your sound waves.

59
00:02:59,607 --> 00:03:07,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, yeah, so it's going to be an interesting show tonight because there's just, there's really not a lot tonight.

60
00:03:08,092 --> 00:03:16,478
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, it's just Jamie and me and we might have one special guest who's around here somewhere and we're just going to talk about stuff.

61
00:03:17,038 --> 00:03:17,318
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

62
00:03:17,418 --> 00:03:22,621
[SPEAKER_08]: We're both in, Jamie and I are both kind of in moods where we just don't give a fuck.

63
00:03:22,641 --> 00:03:22,981
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

64
00:03:24,648 --> 00:03:25,629
[SPEAKER_13]: My socks are stripy.

65
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Yo, I like your socks, they're pretty.

66
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:30,553
[SPEAKER_13]: Sam said that I look like the little bitch that you are.

67
00:03:31,394 --> 00:03:32,675
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll get you if I break you.

68
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:33,436
[SPEAKER_13]: Does he know?

69
00:03:34,196 --> 00:03:37,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so let's take a quick break.

70
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:40,882
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to start off with some old school 5K songs.

71
00:03:41,783 --> 00:03:42,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Visit our chat room.

72
00:03:44,305 --> 00:03:46,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Calibamani.com, click on Orange Lounge, click on chat.

73
00:04:34,112 --> 00:04:34,853
Thanks for watching!

74
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:26,973
[SPEAKER_20]: In the city where the light of the sun shines, that person left a shadow and disappeared.

75
00:05:27,053 --> 00:05:28,934
[SPEAKER_20]: I loved you with a sudden goodbye.

76
00:05:29,014 --> 00:05:31,236
[SPEAKER_20]: I realized at that time.

77
00:05:31,276 --> 00:05:34,298
[SPEAKER_20]: Memories wake up when I forget them in a dream.

78
00:05:47,683 --> 00:06:04,076
[SPEAKER_20]: I love you, we looked at each other, we hugged each other, you kissed me Even if it was just a casual kiss, I knew it I knew there was no such thing as a painful past Once again, just a little bit more, I want to shake your hand

79
00:06:22,995 --> 00:06:23,836
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for watching!

80
00:07:30,521 --> 00:07:36,064
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange and Orange Bay Money Music and More show?

81
00:07:36,364 --> 00:07:43,508
[SPEAKER_27]: The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

82
00:07:43,828 --> 00:07:45,869
[SPEAKER_27]: It's unearthly.

83
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:49,771
[SPEAKER_27]: It's like being in a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

84
00:07:50,171 --> 00:07:54,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 42.

85
00:07:55,054 --> 00:07:57,395
[SPEAKER_08]: And tonight, we're being a little bit sneaky.

86
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,036
[SPEAKER_08]: We're actually pre-taped tonight.

87
00:08:00,477 --> 00:08:03,279
[SPEAKER_08]: But that doesn't mean there isn't a party going on when we're not around.

88
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:07,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Mommy and Daddy aren't home in the chat room, so I'm sure there's plenty of people causing a commotion.

89
00:08:07,681 --> 00:08:09,282
[SPEAKER_08]: So go on in there and party with them.

90
00:08:09,563 --> 00:08:12,664
[SPEAKER_08]: They're over at www.callybomani.com.

91
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,486
[SPEAKER_08]: And you click on Orange Lounge, and then you click on Chat.

92
00:08:16,347 --> 00:08:18,088
[SPEAKER_08]: And join all our obsessive creatures.

93
00:08:18,128 --> 00:08:18,768
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't click on Chat.

94
00:08:20,276 --> 00:08:22,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, don't click on that button that says don't click me.

95
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:26,579
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, don't click on the one that says big piles of poopy.

96
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Click here for Goat Say.

97
00:08:31,181 --> 00:08:31,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Yuck.

98
00:08:32,742 --> 00:08:34,783
[SPEAKER_08]: That was another April Fool's joke.

99
00:08:34,843 --> 00:08:43,267
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, how can you do Goat Say radio?

100
00:08:43,428 --> 00:08:47,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe next year for April Fool's we can play gay porn over the air.

101
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:55,012
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll pipe in my yaoi collection.

102
00:08:56,113 --> 00:08:59,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, I finally did monkey sex on Orange Lounge.

103
00:09:01,135 --> 00:09:03,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Pooh, I sing pooh.

104
00:09:04,537 --> 00:09:04,997
[SPEAKER_13]: Pooh.

105
00:09:06,398 --> 00:09:08,979
[SPEAKER_13]: What was it I was watching that had the monkey jacking off?

106
00:09:11,501 --> 00:09:13,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Conan O'Brien has the masturbating bear.

107
00:09:14,807 --> 00:09:20,009
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it was I think a video tape of these people at the zoo when the monkey was blinking.

108
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,790
[SPEAKER_07]: They show that on cable or something?

109
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,051
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't remember.

110
00:09:25,671 --> 00:09:28,812
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of those Skinamax clips you got to pay extra for.

111
00:09:30,453 --> 00:09:32,854
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god, I watched the blue girl live action.

112
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:35,049
[SPEAKER_07]: La Blue Girl Live Action.

113
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:36,270
[SPEAKER_13]: God, it was horrible.

114
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Describe La Blue Girl for the uninitiated.

115
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:39,593
[SPEAKER_13]: Tentacle Pond.

116
00:09:41,895 --> 00:09:42,836
[SPEAKER_13]: It was an anime.

117
00:09:42,936 --> 00:09:46,920
[SPEAKER_13]: It was really crappy, but oh my god, I never need to see that again.

118
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,642
[SPEAKER_13]: It was like volume three or something.

119
00:09:48,662 --> 00:09:50,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, so there's more than one?

120
00:09:51,204 --> 00:09:52,626
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's like a story.

121
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:56,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the acting as bad as it was in the anime?

122
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:56,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

123
00:09:58,118 --> 00:10:03,559
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, there was some decent acting, but other than that, it was a little like, Oh, it's a garden hose!

124
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:05,860
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, it's going in my mouth!

125
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,661
[SPEAKER_13]: It looked like they were, like, spitting up vegetable oil.

126
00:10:12,902 --> 00:10:15,262
[SPEAKER_08]: I neglected to introduce our special guest tonight.

127
00:10:15,342 --> 00:10:16,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi to Brad, by the way.

128
00:10:18,063 --> 00:10:20,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Um... Oh, shit.

129
00:10:20,323 --> 00:10:23,184
[SPEAKER_05]: I had something I was going to say.

130
00:10:23,224 --> 00:10:23,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

131
00:10:24,404 --> 00:10:24,764
[SPEAKER_14]: Suck it!

132
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:25,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Suck it good!

133
00:10:25,445 --> 00:10:25,925
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh-uh.

134
00:10:27,512 --> 00:10:28,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I hit his teeth.

135
00:10:29,334 --> 00:10:29,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my bad.

136
00:10:30,635 --> 00:10:31,435
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to wipe it off now.

137
00:10:31,475 --> 00:10:31,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.

138
00:10:33,697 --> 00:10:34,878
[SPEAKER_14]: That's really good radio.

139
00:10:39,162 --> 00:10:41,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Today, we're painting on Orange Lounge Radio.

140
00:10:43,746 --> 00:10:45,127
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to make a happy cloud.

141
00:10:45,788 --> 00:10:47,549
[SPEAKER_14]: Happy white clouds.

142
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:49,571
[SPEAKER_14]: Happy white clouds with cocaine.

143
00:10:53,214 --> 00:10:54,976
[SPEAKER_08]: I was so sad when Bob Ross died.

144
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:07,511
[SPEAKER_08]: What other people have died recently that made me go, Mr. Rogers?

145
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:08,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Nell Carter.

146
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:09,211
[SPEAKER_05]: She was cool.

147
00:11:09,231 --> 00:11:09,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Shut up.

148
00:11:09,551 --> 00:11:10,791
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Nell Carter.

149
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:12,852
[SPEAKER_08]: She was cool.

150
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:13,892
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to watch Gimme a Break.

151
00:11:13,912 --> 00:11:14,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Gimme a Break?

152
00:11:14,312 --> 00:11:16,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I don't know.

153
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,650
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, interesting week for us.

154
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,853
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we've all just been very busy and doing, like, random sorts of things.

155
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it's been like a crazy week for me.

156
00:11:35,635 --> 00:11:37,316
[SPEAKER_08]: My car passed smog.

157
00:11:37,536 --> 00:11:39,878
[SPEAKER_13]: Your car passed smog?

158
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:40,299
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay!

159
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,601
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, doing 50.

160
00:11:44,882 --> 00:11:45,963
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been really random.

161
00:11:46,604 --> 00:11:46,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah?

162
00:11:47,104 --> 00:11:48,906
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been working on pictures.

163
00:11:49,026 --> 00:11:49,987
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a desk lamp.

164
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:51,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.

165
00:11:51,488 --> 00:11:53,409
[SPEAKER_13]: It clips onto my shelf.

166
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,492
[SPEAKER_13]: It makes things bright so I don't go blind when I draw.

167
00:11:57,352 --> 00:11:57,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

168
00:12:20,393 --> 00:12:21,914
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a tongue twister, nipple clamp lamp.

169
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,377
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the new erotic song, isn't it?

170
00:12:26,338 --> 00:12:28,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, the new erotic single, nipple clamp lamp.

171
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,001
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's the B-side to temple of butt.

172
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:44,131
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what's interesting is that Dark Tetsuya, who's an obsessive listener of this show, pointed out in the chat room a while back that actually in an earlier episode, and he cites episode 12,

173
00:12:45,928 --> 00:12:50,392
[SPEAKER_08]: I apparently actually said something about Mr. Rogers is not dead.

174
00:12:50,932 --> 00:12:51,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Or something like that.

175
00:12:51,573 --> 00:12:52,554
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember the exact quote.

176
00:12:52,574 --> 00:12:53,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, at that point Mr. Rogers was not dead.

177
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:54,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, at that point Mr. Rogers was not dead.

178
00:12:54,915 --> 00:12:56,437
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just funny that we brought it up on the show.

179
00:12:56,937 --> 00:13:01,020
[SPEAKER_13]: By the way, and I appreciate our listeners.

180
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:02,923
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

181
00:13:26,793 --> 00:13:28,094
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you remember episode 3?

182
00:13:28,134 --> 00:13:28,174
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

183
00:13:28,614 --> 00:13:29,775
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god, I wasn't here.

184
00:13:29,835 --> 00:13:30,555
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you weren't here.

185
00:13:30,595 --> 00:13:31,315
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember that.

186
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:35,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I remember when Orange Lounge Radio started, you were here the first week.

187
00:13:35,418 --> 00:13:36,758
[SPEAKER_08]: We had everybody here the first week.

188
00:13:36,798 --> 00:13:38,999
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the second and third week, it was like, I'm going to Anime Expo.

189
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:39,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

190
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,481
[SPEAKER_13]: That was it, too.

191
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,362
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, I'm in L.A.

192
00:13:44,182 --> 00:13:44,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

193
00:13:44,483 --> 00:13:45,924
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm in San Diego.

194
00:13:46,185 --> 00:13:46,565
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye.

195
00:13:47,966 --> 00:13:50,549
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we were just kind of here without Jamie for a couple weeks.

196
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:51,711
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I went to Alabama.

197
00:13:52,051 --> 00:13:52,451
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye.

198
00:13:53,593 --> 00:13:55,755
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I'm stuck in traffic in San Francisco.

199
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,900
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think... Did the show... Was Alabama... I thought Alabama happened before.

200
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,561
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been doing the show since...

201
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:02,982
[SPEAKER_08]: June 23rd.

202
00:14:03,002 --> 00:14:03,162
[SPEAKER_08]: June 23rd.

203
00:14:27,685 --> 00:14:28,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Who else would I hire?

204
00:14:28,888 --> 00:14:35,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Matt Jamie or Matt But, oh well Not me I'm just a show delinquent It's all good

205
00:14:37,785 --> 00:14:38,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

206
00:15:04,366 --> 00:15:06,008
[SPEAKER_08]: So, God, what else is new this week?

207
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:11,813
[SPEAKER_08]: It's such an interesting show tonight because there's just nothing to talk about.

208
00:15:11,873 --> 00:15:13,955
[SPEAKER_13]: You call that interesting?

209
00:15:15,036 --> 00:15:17,239
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, aren't you excited about tonight's show?

210
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:19,020
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, listeners, I know how to get you excited.

211
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,021
[SPEAKER_13]: Go download some porn.

212
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:20,862
[SPEAKER_13]: It's funny.

213
00:15:20,942 --> 00:15:21,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just get drunk.

214
00:15:21,783 --> 00:15:22,364
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll be funny.

215
00:15:23,344 --> 00:15:23,905
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just kidding.

216
00:15:24,766 --> 00:15:26,087
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, I don't work tomorrow.

217
00:15:26,107 --> 00:15:26,828
[SPEAKER_14]: I can get drunk, sure.

218
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:34,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just pretend we're getting drunk, and then if the show's really bad because we're lagging, we can just say we were drunk, sorry.

219
00:15:35,988 --> 00:15:40,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie will get drunk and I'll get high, and then you'll be sober, so it'll have the best of all of our lives.

220
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:45,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't I... You can get drunk, you can get high, and I'll have sex.

221
00:15:47,953 --> 00:15:49,073
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be in the other room.

222
00:15:49,093 --> 00:15:50,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like the real world.

223
00:15:50,134 --> 00:15:53,435
[SPEAKER_14]: No, because we need to have, we need...

224
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:56,335
[SPEAKER_13]: We need a black person.

225
00:15:57,476 --> 00:16:01,157
[SPEAKER_13]: We need either an Asian or a Pacific Islander.

226
00:16:03,257 --> 00:16:07,198
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to have... Yeah, we need a person with bad hygiene.

227
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:09,519
[SPEAKER_08]: We need everybody to hate somebody else.

228
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:12,260
[SPEAKER_13]: We need the racist.

229
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,400
[SPEAKER_13]: And the racist has to be a roommate with a black person.

230
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:14,821
[SPEAKER_13]: We have Loki.

231
00:16:15,961 --> 00:16:16,441
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Loki.

232
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:19,890
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know where Loki is tonight.

233
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,131
[SPEAKER_08]: He just said he wouldn't be available tonight.

234
00:16:22,171 --> 00:16:29,675
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he's either fapping or he's probably getting ready for the movie on Saturday, which is one reason we're taped tonight.

235
00:16:30,175 --> 00:16:33,917
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe he's having special time with a significant other.

236
00:16:34,057 --> 00:16:35,257
[SPEAKER_09]: That's possible, too.

237
00:16:36,638 --> 00:16:38,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Who has time for relationships?

238
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:38,779
[SPEAKER_09]: I sure don't.

239
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,322
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, see, there's like a special on The Matrix tonight, so...

240
00:16:46,914 --> 00:16:49,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there is a little bit of news.

241
00:16:49,115 --> 00:16:50,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, there's a lot of news.

242
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:50,955
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just being lazy.

243
00:16:52,216 --> 00:16:54,337
[SPEAKER_08]: We're procrastinating for next week.

244
00:16:54,737 --> 00:16:56,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Who said we'd bring you news timely?

245
00:16:56,678 --> 00:16:57,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.

246
00:16:58,138 --> 00:16:58,818
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I realized?

247
00:16:58,838 --> 00:16:59,879
[SPEAKER_08]: We kind of lied last week.

248
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:00,599
[SPEAKER_08]: We did?

249
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:05,061
[SPEAKER_08]: We said that last week was the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio from this studio.

250
00:17:05,781 --> 00:17:07,601
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're actually in the studio tonight.

251
00:17:08,042 --> 00:17:09,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight's the last episode in the studio.

252
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though we're pre-taped.

253
00:17:13,996 --> 00:17:14,597
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm confused.

254
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:15,397
[SPEAKER_08]: I just went cross-eyed.

255
00:17:15,437 --> 00:17:15,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

256
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:16,678
[SPEAKER_10]: I want ice cream.

257
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go get ice cream.

258
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:18,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck this show.

259
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,422
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye.

260
00:17:21,963 --> 00:17:22,904
[SPEAKER_13]: I had salad today.

261
00:17:23,384 --> 00:17:23,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you?

262
00:17:23,985 --> 00:17:24,345
[SPEAKER_08]: From where?

263
00:17:24,906 --> 00:17:25,686
[SPEAKER_14]: The grocery store.

264
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:26,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you toss your salad?

265
00:17:26,887 --> 00:17:28,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I did, actually.

266
00:17:28,609 --> 00:17:29,610
[SPEAKER_14]: It landed on the cat.

267
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:30,511
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what's funny?

268
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:35,115
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a salad today, too, and I shook my salad.

269
00:17:39,187 --> 00:17:42,409
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, uh, one interesting thing that's in Bomani News this week.

270
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:46,931
[SPEAKER_08]: Dancemania EX3 just came out, and I don't have a copy, and I want one.

271
00:17:47,331 --> 00:17:48,372
[SPEAKER_08]: So somebody get me one.

272
00:17:48,392 --> 00:17:49,952
[SPEAKER_13]: What the fuck's on this one this time?

273
00:17:49,992 --> 00:17:50,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Get this.

274
00:17:50,753 --> 00:17:52,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Ace of Base, first track.

275
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,054
[SPEAKER_08]: How cool is that?

276
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:56,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie's blinking.

277
00:17:57,856 --> 00:18:01,258
[SPEAKER_13]: Um... This is great.

278
00:18:01,318 --> 00:18:05,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Creamy has a song on Dancemania EX3 called Help, I'm a Fish.

279
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:06,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool!

280
00:18:08,222 --> 00:18:09,382
[SPEAKER_13]: I have to listen to that.

281
00:18:09,642 --> 00:18:10,122
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god.

282
00:18:10,142 --> 00:18:12,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, track six is called Help, I'm a Fish.

283
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:22,147
[SPEAKER_08]: New Smile DK, new Captain Jack, new Bus Stop, new 2 Unlimited, new DJ Alligator, new Lasco, which is like no surprise if you've been following the EX series.

284
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:27,689
[SPEAKER_08]: A trance remix of Erotic, Gimme Gimme Gimme, the 2003 mix.

285
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:34,031
[SPEAKER_08]: And then another creamy song, a remix of I Do, I Do, I Do.

286
00:18:38,823 --> 00:18:40,524
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking forward to Help I'm a Fish.

287
00:18:40,584 --> 00:18:42,985
[SPEAKER_08]: As soon as we get a copy of that, we'll play that for y'all.

288
00:18:43,045 --> 00:18:43,605
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll be fun.

289
00:18:45,006 --> 00:18:48,687
[SPEAKER_08]: And Bus Stop, it looks like this time around, is covering I Was Made for Loving You.

290
00:18:50,788 --> 00:18:52,669
[SPEAKER_08]: I was made for loving you, baby.

291
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:55,030
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the only way I remember that song is through Moulin Rouge.

292
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,770
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never seen that.

293
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,451
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, you've never seen Moulin Rouge.

294
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,631
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to make you watch that sometime.

295
00:19:00,032 --> 00:19:07,034
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's this part where they, you know, they're going back and forth between all these love songs, and then there's that part where I was made for loving you, baby.

296
00:19:07,054 --> 00:19:08,335
[SPEAKER_08]: You were made for loving me.

297
00:19:09,739 --> 00:19:11,520
[SPEAKER_08]: I should never sing on this show.

298
00:19:12,561 --> 00:19:12,901
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

299
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:14,162
Indeed.

300
00:19:15,043 --> 00:19:16,284
[SPEAKER_08]: I might.

301
00:19:17,685 --> 00:19:20,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other fun Dance Mania albums coming out that we should give a mention to?

302
00:19:21,548 --> 00:19:24,910
[SPEAKER_13]: Dance Mania, my ass mixer.

303
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:25,630
[SPEAKER_08]: What'll be on that?

304
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,292
[SPEAKER_14]: I was made for Party On You.

305
00:19:29,353 --> 00:19:29,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.

306
00:19:30,894 --> 00:19:31,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Lovely.

307
00:19:31,595 --> 00:19:32,836
[SPEAKER_14]: I was made for Stiffy Glue.

308
00:19:36,763 --> 00:19:39,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Other fun, happy, fun news this week.

309
00:19:41,526 --> 00:19:45,708
[SPEAKER_08]: This has nothing to do with Bomani, but a lot of you that follow Bomani also follow Konami.

310
00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:50,071
[SPEAKER_08]: And Konami has another game series that's somewhat popular.

311
00:19:50,551 --> 00:19:51,571
[SPEAKER_08]: It's known a little bit.

312
00:19:52,132 --> 00:19:53,112
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Castlevania.

313
00:19:54,453 --> 00:19:55,213
[SPEAKER_08]: And get this.

314
00:19:55,874 --> 00:19:59,296
[SPEAKER_08]: The new Castlevania is coming out.

315
00:19:59,496 --> 00:20:00,016
[SPEAKER_08]: And look at that.

316
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:00,917
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 3D.

317
00:20:02,228 --> 00:20:03,428
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you on Castlevania Dungeon?

318
00:20:03,588 --> 00:20:03,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

319
00:20:04,989 --> 00:20:08,730
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, wait a second, but the last time I tried to do a 3D Castlevania game, it sucked shit.

320
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, I'm not sure this is new.

321
00:20:13,511 --> 00:20:14,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was up yesterday.

322
00:20:17,312 --> 00:20:18,112
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, you know what?

323
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,173
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is what it says at the bottom.

324
00:20:20,213 --> 00:20:28,355
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, the article says this game will be entirely in 3D, but is not intended to be like Castlevania 64, which the producer openly admitted to hating.

325
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:33,054
[SPEAKER_08]: The game takes place in the 11th century, apparently, but other story details are pretty vague.

326
00:20:33,114 --> 00:20:34,776
[SPEAKER_13]: God damn it, they need to do another one with Richter.

327
00:20:34,796 --> 00:20:39,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody pray to whatever god you believe in that this game does not suck, please.

328
00:20:39,622 --> 00:20:41,244
[SPEAKER_13]: They need another game with Richter.

329
00:20:45,028 --> 00:20:48,753
[SPEAKER_13]: Or as Maria said it in the English version, Richter.

330
00:21:02,785 --> 00:21:05,346
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, you know, you're forgetting another comic game.

331
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:06,247
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that?

332
00:21:06,587 --> 00:21:08,728
[SPEAKER_13]: Freaking Gradius V. When's that come out?

333
00:21:09,329 --> 00:21:09,649
[SPEAKER_13]: New.

334
00:21:09,989 --> 00:21:10,609
[SPEAKER_13]: It's soon.

335
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:11,670
[SPEAKER_08]: It's new!

336
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,311
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's soon.

337
00:21:13,671 --> 00:21:15,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Gradius V on PS2.

338
00:21:16,212 --> 00:21:17,173
[SPEAKER_13]: On the piece of shit 2.

339
00:21:17,213 --> 00:21:17,513
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

340
00:21:18,293 --> 00:21:20,394
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know what it is.

341
00:21:21,555 --> 00:21:28,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Now... Just because they took, like, parts out of old, like, space shuttles and stuff to make this thing doesn't mean it's, like, it doesn't do that.

342
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:35,046
[SPEAKER_13]: I just think people can't program for it for shit, or else we would definitely have games that looked better.

343
00:21:40,252 --> 00:21:43,996
[SPEAKER_13]: Metal Gear Solid 2 was nice, but it was better on Xbox, I have to say.

344
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:48,140
[SPEAKER_13]: It, it, because there was more room for anti-aliasing.

345
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:48,380
Oh!

346
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:49,041
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh!

347
00:21:49,825 --> 00:21:49,985
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh!

348
00:21:50,545 --> 00:21:51,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god!

349
00:21:51,186 --> 00:21:51,786
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

350
00:21:51,806 --> 00:21:54,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Tekken 3 and Metal Gear Solid on Bling.

351
00:21:54,327 --> 00:21:54,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Bling bling.

352
00:22:15,894 --> 00:22:17,054
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

353
00:22:17,435 --> 00:22:19,095
[SPEAKER_08]: I have nothing really to say on Castlevania.

354
00:22:19,235 --> 00:22:19,916
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what's interesting?

355
00:22:20,436 --> 00:22:25,839
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't own a PlayStation 2 American, and I'm not really going to be importing any games outside of...

356
00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:29,181
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna be getting Final Fantasy 7 too, hopefully next month I've already seen the ending

357
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:47,774
[SPEAKER_05]: No spoilers.

358
00:22:48,754 --> 00:22:50,896
[SPEAKER_05]: You could just get a mod chip and, you know.

359
00:22:50,916 --> 00:22:51,676
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

360
00:22:51,736 --> 00:22:52,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

361
00:22:52,457 --> 00:22:55,939
[SPEAKER_13]: Because any other game that's going to come out after that is not going to work.

362
00:22:55,959 --> 00:23:00,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I used to say that when the PS2 just came out because it's understandable, you know, it just came out.

363
00:23:00,623 --> 00:23:06,367
[SPEAKER_05]: But now PS2's kind of, it's starting to become the end of its life and all the best games that are out, I mean.

364
00:23:06,387 --> 00:23:11,571
[SPEAKER_13]: So how about when you, if you mod your system now and then 7th style comes out and it won't work with your system?

365
00:23:12,051 --> 00:23:22,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I'll go buy 7thfile I mean, 7thfile will work as a purchased version I don't need to take pictures of it to play it And 7thfile won't come out What?

366
00:23:22,648 --> 00:23:23,029
[SPEAKER_05]: What, Rob?

367
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:23,349
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

368
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:24,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Well...

369
00:23:25,101 --> 00:23:33,448
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard that before about, you know, that you get the mod chip and then Sony could release a game that would basically fuck up your mod chip.

370
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:36,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Or, you know, they override the copy protection, kind of like they did with the early chips on PS1s.

371
00:23:36,671 --> 00:23:39,013
[SPEAKER_13]: Sony was even doing it right to the end of the PlayStation's life.

372
00:23:39,173 --> 00:23:39,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

373
00:23:39,694 --> 00:23:45,359
[SPEAKER_08]: And what's interesting about that is what they could do with it is they could do it through online purposes.

374
00:23:45,899 --> 00:23:49,802
[SPEAKER_08]: It's possible, you know, if your PS2 is online, you go online with Final Fantasy XI...

375
00:23:50,984 --> 00:23:58,499
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, sneak sneak, it's updating your BIOS That's why I just won't play it on the computer Because it's coming out for computer in America

376
00:23:59,151 --> 00:24:12,922
[SPEAKER_13]: By the way, if anyone is interested in that, if you go to squareenixusa.com, you can submit an application to beta test Final Fantasy XI for PC or for PS2.

377
00:24:12,942 --> 00:24:15,324
[SPEAKER_05]: I really hope they choose me to do the beta test.

378
00:24:15,344 --> 00:24:19,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Please, please, Square, I've played your game since the beginning.

379
00:24:19,287 --> 00:24:20,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not since the beginning.

380
00:24:20,068 --> 00:24:23,750
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm more than positive I'm going to get selected because I've done game beta testing before.

381
00:24:25,312 --> 00:24:26,613
[SPEAKER_13]: I played Ragnarok Online, ew.

382
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:32,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that sucks they didn't continue that over here, because I really want to play Ragnarok.

383
00:24:32,145 --> 00:24:32,786
[SPEAKER_05]: You lucky people.

384
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:34,027
[SPEAKER_13]: They're still in beta testing right now.

385
00:24:34,047 --> 00:24:38,010
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but it's like they're only working with... The paid release is going to be out, I think, for the next couple months.

386
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:40,432
[SPEAKER_05]: And they are going to America with it?

387
00:24:40,492 --> 00:24:42,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it sounded like they were neglecting America.

388
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:44,355
[SPEAKER_13]: They have an American beta test open right now.

389
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:48,619
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I mean, it's a closed beta, but they have it going on right now.

390
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:55,925
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's been talked about on here, but for those who don't know, Ragnarokonline.com, I don't know how it's spelled, R-A-G-N-O-R...

391
00:24:57,034 --> 00:24:59,857
[SPEAKER_13]: R-A-G-N-A-R, okay.

392
00:25:00,358 --> 00:25:00,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

393
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,443
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really cool game, it's like Secret of Mana online or something, kind of.

394
00:25:06,284 --> 00:25:06,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what you'd say?

395
00:25:07,104 --> 00:25:07,485
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

396
00:25:08,446 --> 00:25:11,028
[SPEAKER_13]: It's 3D environment, 2D characters.

397
00:25:11,689 --> 00:25:17,955
[SPEAKER_08]: That's actually what I was thinking, is that every time I see Ragnarok online, I go, God, I really want to play a Secret of Mana online.

398
00:25:19,414 --> 00:25:19,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

399
00:25:20,636 --> 00:25:20,857
[SPEAKER_13]: R.O.'

400
00:25:20,837 --> 00:25:22,079
[SPEAKER_05]: 's about the closest you can get.

401
00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:26,086
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, it's like Secret of Mana with Final Fantasy Tactics type job systems.

402
00:25:26,406 --> 00:25:27,749
[SPEAKER_13]: And grasshoppers that play the fiddle.

403
00:25:28,891 --> 00:25:30,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking fiddle playing grasshoppers.

404
00:25:31,423 --> 00:25:31,603
[SPEAKER_08]: POPCAP.COM

405
00:26:01,473 --> 00:26:03,794
[SPEAKER_08]: It still needs a lot of tweaking, but it's interesting.

406
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:04,675
[SPEAKER_08]: It's worth checking out.

407
00:26:04,695 --> 00:26:06,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to popcap.com because it's free.

408
00:26:07,396 --> 00:26:09,757
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if you pay money, you get special things.

409
00:26:09,817 --> 00:26:13,459
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, I'm still doing Neopets, okay?

410
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,500
[SPEAKER_08]: I have not checked on my Neopet in two weeks.

411
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,701
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to give you my money.

412
00:26:21,428 --> 00:26:23,009
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're loving your pet, give me your money.

413
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:23,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

414
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,593
[SPEAKER_13]: So that I can get up to 500,000.

415
00:26:28,774 --> 00:26:29,574
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I have like 25,000.

416
00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:31,876
[SPEAKER_13]: That's actually about what I need.

417
00:26:32,877 --> 00:26:33,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

418
00:26:34,138 --> 00:26:34,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Mwahaha.

419
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:40,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Seriously, I've been trying to get up to... Is that like the last level of saving?

420
00:26:40,263 --> 00:26:41,844
[SPEAKER_13]: No, that's about three from it.

421
00:26:42,524 --> 00:26:45,687
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm trying to upgrade to my next bank account.

422
00:26:47,978 --> 00:26:50,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, why don't we take ourselves a quickie little break.

423
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,001
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to come back.

424
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:52,883
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to talk about Max 2.

425
00:26:52,923 --> 00:26:57,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Max 2, Japan, came out this week, and there's been some interesting early reaction.

426
00:26:57,767 --> 00:27:02,252
[SPEAKER_08]: We're sitting here on Thursday night, pre-taping Sunday's show, and there's already been some early reaction.

427
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:07,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Some folks in the States have picked it up and have some interesting things to say about it.

428
00:27:07,156 --> 00:27:08,598
[SPEAKER_08]: So we will take a quick break.

429
00:27:09,078 --> 00:27:10,920
[SPEAKER_13]: About the overwhelming lack of monkeys.

430
00:27:11,385 --> 00:27:12,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, about the lack of monkey sex.

431
00:27:12,887 --> 00:27:15,410
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to play some Anothers for the hell of it.

432
00:27:16,211 --> 00:27:19,615
[SPEAKER_08]: We're feeling saucy, so let's start this off with Spica, Another.

433
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,598
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll be back on Orange Lounge Radio.

434
00:28:08,445 --> 00:28:08,828
and many more.

435
00:31:04,922 --> 00:31:05,965
Thanks for watching!

436
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,409
[SPEAKER_10]: Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

437
00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:04,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Bongo demands it.

438
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,091
[SPEAKER_08]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

439
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:08,131
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you enjoyed those and others.

440
00:33:08,191 --> 00:33:10,232
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Spica, Leading Cyber, and Reincarnation.

441
00:33:10,272 --> 00:33:10,532
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

442
00:33:10,552 --> 00:33:12,753
[SPEAKER_08]: I've actually never heard Reincarnation and others before.

443
00:33:13,253 --> 00:33:17,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Because usually I'm too chicken to play and others on 2DX because I don't want to waste my money.

444
00:33:18,715 --> 00:33:20,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

445
00:33:22,316 --> 00:33:24,457
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was sitting here going, this song isn't any different.

446
00:33:24,577 --> 00:33:26,237
[SPEAKER_08]: And then finally they're like, wait.

447
00:33:26,397 --> 00:33:27,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie and Brad are like, wait.

448
00:33:27,818 --> 00:33:28,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait for it.

449
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait for it!

450
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:40,204
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finally in the end it has that... It has a little way different part at the end, so... What a cool... Roll to see if I'm getting drunk.

451
00:33:41,885 --> 00:33:43,365
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, you're getting drunk!

452
00:33:45,206 --> 00:33:45,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Blink, blink.

453
00:33:45,926 --> 00:33:47,047
[SPEAKER_13]: Got any Mountain Dew?

454
00:33:52,109 --> 00:33:54,850
[SPEAKER_13]: We're talking about the potential...

455
00:33:55,785 --> 00:33:56,626
[SPEAKER_13]: Battle Royale

456
00:34:12,243 --> 00:34:14,104
[SPEAKER_08]: is basically what it has come down to.

457
00:34:14,584 --> 00:34:25,627
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got this little inside cult of folks here locally in Sacramento and abroad because it's kind of spawned from the Orange Lounge chat room and then some of just this obsession with the movie Battle Royale.

458
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:32,769
[SPEAKER_13]: And now... I'm running a game probably in a few weeks.

459
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:36,811
[SPEAKER_13]: Me and Jas and now Pepe's involved.

460
00:34:38,024 --> 00:34:40,747
[SPEAKER_08]: And Puppy's testing his dice script in our chat room right now.

461
00:34:41,487 --> 00:34:45,651
[SPEAKER_13]: But, um, we're, uh, yeah, it's gonna be definitely dice-based.

462
00:34:45,852 --> 00:34:49,315
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, let's go ahead and give a couple little spoilers about that.

463
00:34:49,836 --> 00:34:52,318
[SPEAKER_13]: We've already selected what the random weapons are.

464
00:34:52,698 --> 00:34:52,999
[SPEAKER_18]: Ooh.

465
00:34:54,147 --> 00:35:01,988
[SPEAKER_13]: We have already, there's going to be, people are going to have certain skills like people normally do.

466
00:35:02,148 --> 00:35:06,009
[SPEAKER_13]: You've got your stats, we'll help you with that.

467
00:35:06,649 --> 00:35:14,211
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sort of half deciding of having the game last a few weeks more than just the normal, however many it takes to kill everybody off.

468
00:35:14,791 --> 00:35:20,752
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can establish what your character's like and your friends and your group before you decide to kill each other off.

469
00:35:21,815 --> 00:35:23,116
[SPEAKER_08]: So how exactly is it going to work?

470
00:35:23,156 --> 00:35:25,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it going to be like a chat room that runs 24 hours a day?

471
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:26,259
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

472
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:28,140
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's only going to be a certain day and time.

473
00:35:28,381 --> 00:35:34,205
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be probably three hours, the game should last, or until we say, okay, we're tired.

474
00:35:34,706 --> 00:35:34,946
[SPEAKER_13]: Got it.

475
00:35:35,126 --> 00:35:36,447
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's going to be one night a week.

476
00:35:37,288 --> 00:35:41,592
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll do my best to put it on a Friday night.

477
00:35:41,832 --> 00:35:43,934
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm thinking a Friday night would be the best night for this.

478
00:35:45,675 --> 00:36:12,558
[SPEAKER_13]: and basically you roleplay and if you suck at roleplay by the way as in you're not staying in character you're not developing your character even though your character is going to die you'll just die all the faster because I'm a pretty spiteful GM which is probably why I will not be participating because I suck at roleplay I was always there to provoke the GM in interesting ways

479
00:36:15,181 --> 00:36:21,367
[SPEAKER_13]: I sometimes think that it's a little bit easier to roleplay online as opposed to tabletop.

480
00:36:21,567 --> 00:36:26,071
[SPEAKER_13]: Just because you have a little bit more room for some description.

481
00:36:27,012 --> 00:36:32,818
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're a shy person by nature, you don't have to say something that you would normally be uncomfortable saying.

482
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:33,758
[SPEAKER_13]: It's easier to type it.

483
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, you need to roleplay and say that in a British accent.

484
00:36:37,922 --> 00:36:38,823
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

485
00:36:41,773 --> 00:36:46,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, as promised... Oh yeah, Brad, do you have something you want to say?

486
00:36:46,957 --> 00:36:47,097
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

487
00:36:47,117 --> 00:36:47,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

488
00:36:47,717 --> 00:36:49,439
[SPEAKER_08]: As we promised before the break... I killed you!

489
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,043
[SPEAKER_08]: We were going to talk about... Max 2 just came out in Japan this week.

490
00:36:55,923 --> 00:37:00,867
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's probably more information on it now that it's Sunday, but it's only Thursday when we're taping here.

491
00:37:01,447 --> 00:37:03,229
[SPEAKER_08]: And we don't know a lot at this point.

492
00:37:03,309 --> 00:37:06,791
[SPEAKER_08]: However, we do know what the unlocks are.

493
00:37:07,552 --> 00:37:07,752
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

494
00:37:08,883 --> 00:37:13,228
[SPEAKER_08]: The unlocks that you're going to get in Max 2, you've got me burping.

495
00:37:13,408 --> 00:37:14,249
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the first unlock.

496
00:37:14,289 --> 00:37:19,175
[SPEAKER_08]: No, the next unlock is all of the remixes.

497
00:37:19,215 --> 00:37:20,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I don't know what order these unlock in.

498
00:37:20,897 --> 00:37:22,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I haven't gotten a list or anything.

499
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:27,664
[SPEAKER_08]: But you get all the remixes, the Max 2 remixes that you can play in Extreme.

500
00:37:29,303 --> 00:37:51,285
[SPEAKER_08]: and then we know that you can unlock Crash or actually I think that's one of the songs you start off with is Crash and then Paranoia Survivor and there was one more Love Love Shine or Love Love Sugar one of those two Love Love Shine it's Love Love Shine you get you also unlock

501
00:37:52,316 --> 00:38:01,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Almost everything from Max USA that was exclusive, except the license tracks.

502
00:38:01,939 --> 00:38:07,621
[SPEAKER_08]: So you get Shining Polaris, Peace Out, Overblast, Logical Dash, Jammin' Marmalade, and I'm For Real.

503
00:38:07,641 --> 00:38:08,221
[SPEAKER_08]: You get all that.

504
00:38:09,341 --> 00:38:13,323
[SPEAKER_08]: And you also get Look to the Sky, True Color, Dynamite Rave, Downbird Soda.

505
00:38:13,343 --> 00:38:14,183
[SPEAKER_08]: You get all those songs.

506
00:38:15,103 --> 00:38:16,043
[SPEAKER_13]: We had them first.

507
00:38:16,263 --> 00:38:17,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we had them first, so Nina.

508
00:38:17,764 --> 00:38:20,985
[SPEAKER_08]: And we still have... I like to move it.

509
00:38:23,932 --> 00:38:27,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, for whatever reason, they're bringing back Kind Lady and So In Love.

510
00:38:27,916 --> 00:38:33,061
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, those songs are pretty cool and all, but it's kind of interesting because they were on the last mix.

511
00:38:33,822 --> 00:38:37,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, there's some brand spanking new stuff.

512
00:38:38,827 --> 00:38:40,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Do It Right, the 80s electro mix.

513
00:38:43,007 --> 00:38:44,348
[SPEAKER_08]: which is remixed by Soda.

514
00:38:45,049 --> 00:38:46,390
[SPEAKER_08]: And I hear it's pretty good.

515
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,872
[SPEAKER_08]: We had some folks in the chatroom that have heard it, and it's pretty good.

516
00:38:49,592 --> 00:38:52,495
[SPEAKER_08]: As soon as we get MP3s, we'll play them for you guys.

517
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:55,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind Lady, The Interlude.

518
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:57,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever that could mean.

519
00:38:57,799 --> 00:39:00,141
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder if that's just that little groove beat at the beginning.

520
00:39:02,343 --> 00:39:02,723
[SPEAKER_08]: You know that?

521
00:39:02,743 --> 00:39:05,265
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of like... You sounded like a banjo.

522
00:39:07,407 --> 00:39:08,408
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob does bluegrass.

523
00:39:10,589 --> 00:39:11,110
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

524
00:39:12,011 --> 00:39:12,511
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

525
00:39:14,764 --> 00:39:16,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I want to get an MP3, so I don't have to sing this.

526
00:39:16,766 --> 00:39:19,129
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to find an MP3 so you can hear what I'm talking about here.

527
00:39:19,569 --> 00:39:20,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, like this part.

528
00:39:25,956 --> 00:39:26,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the porno part.

529
00:39:26,937 --> 00:39:28,078
[SPEAKER_05]: We used that in a porn movie.

530
00:39:28,098 --> 00:39:28,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we did.

531
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:29,460
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that.

532
00:39:30,721 --> 00:39:30,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

533
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:32,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.

534
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:34,144
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure, yeah.

535
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:36,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Also unlockable...

536
00:39:37,342 --> 00:39:43,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Look to the Sky, the Trance Mix, which is not Look to the Sky, the True Color Mix.

537
00:39:43,385 --> 00:39:46,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Now there's going to be three Look to the Skies all together.

538
00:39:46,047 --> 00:39:47,187
[SPEAKER_13]: Look to the Sky, Fart Mix.

539
00:39:49,569 --> 00:39:51,390
[SPEAKER_13]: Look to the Sky, because it stinks down below.

540
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:58,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, how about, you know, like, look up to the skirt or something.

541
00:39:58,934 --> 00:39:59,214
Yeah.

542
00:40:00,777 --> 00:40:06,199
[SPEAKER_08]: So you only get those three new songs, or pretty much the only super-duper new songs.

543
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:10,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, they had to retool all of the Oni courses.

544
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,660
[SPEAKER_08]: I said tool.

545
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:18,422
[SPEAKER_08]: They had to retool all of the Oni courses, so you have the Oni courses more light, which is like some easy stuff, it's like the lesson Oni.

546
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,652
[SPEAKER_08]: B4U, of course, because where would we be without a B4U-only course?

547
00:40:24,393 --> 00:40:31,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Nearly 130, however, since a minute it did not make it into Max 2 home version, they have Spin the Disc replacing a minute.

548
00:40:33,037 --> 00:40:33,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Spin the Dicks.

549
00:40:34,978 --> 00:40:39,100
[SPEAKER_08]: They have the From 2DX course, except now it has Gemma Marmalade and all these other songs.

550
00:40:40,684 --> 00:40:49,888
[SPEAKER_08]: The Love Song Collection, which is Baby Love Me, So In Love, Silent Hill, Dive Into The Night, which I never knew was a love song, and My Summer Love.

551
00:40:51,289 --> 00:40:54,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Now they have a DJ Soda Oni, which is pretty cool.

552
00:40:55,430 --> 00:41:00,873
[SPEAKER_08]: A middle tempo course, which is just kind of all like... Okay, I'm just noticing something.

553
00:41:00,893 --> 00:41:02,373
[SPEAKER_05]: It says DJ Soda Oni.

554
00:41:02,713 --> 00:41:03,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is Kind Lady in there?

555
00:41:03,754 --> 00:41:04,814
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was Okuyatos.

556
00:41:05,795 --> 00:41:08,676
[SPEAKER_08]: But Kind Lady Interlude, I believe, is remixed by Soda Oni.

557
00:41:10,085 --> 00:41:10,585
[SPEAKER_25]: Answer my question?

558
00:41:11,545 --> 00:41:11,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

559
00:41:12,446 --> 00:41:15,746
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you have the middle tempo chorus, which is kind of like a bunch of Dance Mania songs.

560
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:18,267
[SPEAKER_08]: You have a chorus called Rap Mania.

561
00:41:20,587 --> 00:41:25,248
[SPEAKER_08]: And these are the songs that apparently are rap, according to Konami.

562
00:41:26,308 --> 00:41:36,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Long Train Runnin', Little Boy, Superstar, Hysteria, D2A, Burnin' the Floor, and Be For You.

563
00:41:39,071 --> 00:41:39,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

564
00:41:41,043 --> 00:41:46,884
[SPEAKER_08]: The Midnight Blue course is back, except they've replaced one song with another AM3P remix.

565
00:41:47,044 --> 00:41:52,185
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what song they took out, but... Do you remember the original Midnight Blue course?

566
00:41:55,906 --> 00:41:56,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, whatever, fine.

567
00:41:58,427 --> 00:42:03,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Now they have a BPM 140 course, so now we have nearly 130 and nearly 140.

568
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:15,972
[SPEAKER_08]: A tricky course, which I'm not sure yet, but rumor... Yeah, rumor is it's like the trick Oni in Extreme.

569
00:42:16,032 --> 00:42:17,033
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got changes in it.

570
00:42:18,133 --> 00:42:20,633
[SPEAKER_08]: A random Oni course, and this is the thing.

571
00:42:20,733 --> 00:42:23,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only is it random songs, but it's random modifiers.

572
00:42:24,954 --> 00:42:31,396
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a fellow in the chatroom, you know him if you listen to the show religiously, Jazz, was playing random...

573
00:42:32,496 --> 00:42:45,888
[SPEAKER_08]: And the random came up with Kind Lady, Reverse, nothing gonna stop, no mods, Silent Hill, Sudden, Mysterio 2001, Reverse, Boost, and then like Burning Heat, 2-speed, Boost, Reverse, and then Kind Lady, 3-speed, Boost.

574
00:42:45,908 --> 00:42:48,551
[SPEAKER_08]: So like it just fucks up all your modifiers.

575
00:42:51,698 --> 00:42:56,263
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a Naoki Platinum course, which actually, I believe, is the same course.

576
00:42:56,664 --> 00:42:59,026
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's the one course that retained itself.

577
00:42:59,627 --> 00:43:00,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, I'll be damned.

578
00:43:01,369 --> 00:43:06,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, some course in Japanese, that I'll... I don't know, I can't translate.

579
00:43:06,555 --> 00:43:08,697
[SPEAKER_08]: It has a star in it, so it's not really all Japanese.

580
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:11,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm, something woman?

581
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it like the D.Va course?

582
00:43:14,542 --> 00:43:15,003
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be.

583
00:43:15,043 --> 00:43:17,365
[SPEAKER_08]: I think these are all... Yeah, these are all songs by women.

584
00:43:17,525 --> 00:43:18,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, what's up?

585
00:43:18,866 --> 00:43:19,347
[SPEAKER_13]: Copy that.

586
00:43:19,547 --> 00:43:21,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and put it into Globalgate?

587
00:43:21,689 --> 00:43:23,871
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but I know one of them is from the film.

588
00:43:24,452 --> 00:43:25,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's see.

589
00:43:25,252 --> 00:43:27,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's translate that.

590
00:43:34,101 --> 00:43:35,522
[SPEAKER_08]: And the answer is... Unicron.

591
00:43:36,223 --> 00:43:37,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Maiden Way.

592
00:43:38,205 --> 00:43:38,505
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

593
00:43:38,745 --> 00:43:39,046
Yeah.

594
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it's Girls' Course.

595
00:43:40,381 --> 00:43:44,683
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be just a normal, pure translation, but it might be something else.

596
00:43:44,743 --> 00:43:46,184
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's like Girls' Course.

597
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,386
[SPEAKER_13]: It's my Girls' Course!

598
00:43:53,368 --> 00:43:56,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Up and Down is another course.

599
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,351
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea what these songs have in common.

600
00:43:59,652 --> 00:44:02,414
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's the Shitty Demon Road.

601
00:44:04,249 --> 00:44:06,711
[SPEAKER_08]: What about the Ultra 64?

602
00:44:06,771 --> 00:44:07,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to my mommy.

603
00:44:07,892 --> 00:44:08,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Not to my mommy.

604
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,622
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can order that now, DDR Max 2.

605
00:44:38,702 --> 00:44:42,446
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, if you ordered it from Konami Style already, you'll be getting a VRare CD.

606
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:52,016
[SPEAKER_08]: And what's interesting is that those tracks on the VRare CD that we talked about, like Glacial, the I Feel remix, the Soda remix of I Feel and all that stuff, not in Max 2.

607
00:44:52,937 --> 00:44:53,998
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just there.

608
00:44:54,338 --> 00:44:57,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they'll probably be in a future one.

609
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:05,333
[SPEAKER_13]: So we shall see.

610
00:45:06,073 --> 00:45:11,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, if you haven't already heard yet, there's some other features in there, like you can create your own Oni course.

611
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:23,106
[SPEAKER_08]: So, anything else you guys want to say about Max 2?

612
00:45:24,798 --> 00:45:29,081
[SPEAKER_13]: Nobody got it for me for my birthday, so I have to get it next month.

613
00:45:29,761 --> 00:45:31,702
[SPEAKER_08]: I have more money, but I didn't even buy it for myself.

614
00:45:35,104 --> 00:45:36,305
[SPEAKER_05]: I have something to say.

615
00:45:36,325 --> 00:45:37,205
[SPEAKER_05]: This DDR sucks.

616
00:45:38,526 --> 00:45:38,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

617
00:45:39,226 --> 00:45:39,767
[SPEAKER_08]: That's very nice.

618
00:45:40,107 --> 00:45:40,887
[SPEAKER_13]: You're rapping cool.

619
00:45:42,528 --> 00:45:43,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, what else?

620
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:49,993
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking at the official DDR Max 2 website.

621
00:45:50,526 --> 00:45:53,728
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just trying to see if there's any, like, new information or anything cool.

622
00:45:54,588 --> 00:45:56,049
[SPEAKER_13]: Doesn't look like it.

623
00:45:57,690 --> 00:45:57,930
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

624
00:45:58,011 --> 00:45:58,371
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm what?

625
00:46:01,813 --> 00:46:02,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck the chatroom.

626
00:46:02,573 --> 00:46:03,334
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just kidding.

627
00:46:05,075 --> 00:46:06,055
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the chatroom.

628
00:46:08,437 --> 00:46:10,318
[SPEAKER_05]: He loves the chatroom for dinner.

629
00:46:11,379 --> 00:46:12,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Op, I have foods.

630
00:46:12,699 --> 00:46:13,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Chuck chuck.

631
00:46:14,941 --> 00:46:16,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Get you the hot bullets of shotgun to die.

632
00:46:18,379 --> 00:46:19,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us about that story, Brad.

633
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,041
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

634
00:46:21,081 --> 00:46:21,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Please, please.

635
00:46:24,044 --> 00:46:29,649
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been hearing from DarkSakura's SO that he's been saying this thing.

636
00:46:29,709 --> 00:46:32,131
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes, get you the hot shotgun bullets to die.

637
00:46:32,211 --> 00:46:39,198
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's kind of like in the vein of All Your Base, you know, bad English, some bad translation from an old Japanese game.

638
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:42,941
[SPEAKER_05]: I found out on English.com, which I love.

639
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:44,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Go check it out, English.com.

640
00:46:44,763 --> 00:46:44,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

641
00:46:45,542 --> 00:46:46,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Makeup, you're on Ingrish!

642
00:47:14,613 --> 00:47:20,036
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to translate Konami's Q&A on Max 2, and we're going to read it.

643
00:47:21,017 --> 00:47:23,358
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like a radio drama, so this will be fun.

644
00:47:23,858 --> 00:47:28,601
[SPEAKER_08]: So this segment is called... Ingrish Like What?

645
00:47:28,801 --> 00:47:29,722

[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

650
00:47:39,387 --> 00:47:41,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, who wants to be question man and who wants to be answer man?

651
00:47:45,509 --> 00:47:47,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright Brad, are you Question Man or Answer Man?

652
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:48,490
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be Question Man.

653
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:50,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Question Man, first question.

654
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:52,091
[SPEAKER_13]: You sound like you're Mega Man.

655
00:47:53,231 --> 00:47:55,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Question Man, I will ask you questions.

656
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:57,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we have it in English?

657
00:47:58,652 --> 00:47:59,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this it?

658
00:48:00,393 --> 00:48:00,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

659
00:48:01,333 --> 00:48:04,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Can an exclusive controller be used even if set to PS2?

660
00:48:04,814 --> 00:48:05,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Please feel easy!

661
00:48:06,314 --> 00:48:11,016
[SPEAKER_09]: An exclusive controller and exclusive use hand controller also operate satisfactory.

662
00:48:11,716 --> 00:48:12,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

663
00:48:15,253 --> 00:48:18,675
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a question?

664
00:48:18,916 --> 00:48:19,876
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a question?

665
00:48:28,248 --> 00:48:34,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Dance Dance Revolution Series When linked with an arcade machine, output edit data by library manager.

666
00:48:34,669 --> 00:48:39,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Copy the edit data file which outputted to memory card for PlayStation by browser of PlayStation 2.

667
00:48:40,551 --> 00:48:45,752
[SPEAKER_08]: The edit data file copied to memory card for PlayStation can be used now by arcade machine, etc.

668
00:48:46,272 --> 00:48:56,354
[SPEAKER_08]: When the edit data of the past series is used, copy an edit data file to the memory card only for PlayStation 2 from memory card for PlayStation by the browser of PlayStation 2.

669
00:48:57,501 --> 00:49:02,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Load the memory card, only for PlayStation 2, which copy data and start edit mode.

670
00:49:02,589 --> 00:49:04,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Input data by outside manager.

671
00:49:04,212 --> 00:49:09,059
[SPEAKER_08]: The data inputted by the edit library can be edited in edit mode or can be used in game mode.

672
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Game mode?

673
00:49:10,742 --> 00:49:10,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Ugh.

674
00:49:12,084 --> 00:49:12,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Ugh.

675
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:14,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice, very good.

676
00:49:14,431 --> 00:49:14,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

677
00:49:15,192 --> 00:49:19,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't the function in which a screen position can be adjusted carried in Dan Dan's resolution?

678
00:49:20,096 --> 00:49:26,041
[SPEAKER_08]: The screen adjustment function of demand is added to option from the second edition DDR Max 2 of PS.

679
00:49:26,502 --> 00:49:28,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Please confirm by options.

680
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Graphic, options, screen adjustment.

681
00:49:31,165 --> 00:49:31,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god.

682
00:49:31,986 --> 00:49:32,387
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

683
00:49:32,867 --> 00:49:33,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

684
00:49:34,829 --> 00:49:36,290
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was Max 2 English.

685
00:49:38,124 --> 00:49:43,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Max to English, Max to English, Max to English I think it was English like what originally?

686
00:49:43,228 --> 00:49:43,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

687
00:49:44,008 --> 00:49:44,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, sorry.

688
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:47,671
[SPEAKER_20]: English like what?

689
00:49:47,731 --> 00:49:48,612
[SPEAKER_20]: English like what?

690
00:49:49,552 --> 00:49:49,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

691
00:49:50,653 --> 00:49:59,659
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's funnier, because I've done this before, is going to the Konami site, the 2DX site, where they have interviews with some of the artists for the new songs on each version.

692
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Translate that shit, it's really fucking awful.

693
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:10,164
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, the site used for the translations is nifty.com slash victory Hey, I have Samurai Shodown on Neo Geo And it does say victory

694
00:50:27,188 --> 00:50:27,909
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what's funny?

695
00:50:27,989 --> 00:50:36,714
[SPEAKER_13]: If you have any of the Japanese games, like I have the Japanese Samurai Spirits 2, which is Samurai Shodown, it'll play it in American mode and turn all the blood into sweat.

696
00:50:37,975 --> 00:50:41,957
[SPEAKER_13]: So like these big geysers of white fluid come shooting out of their bodies.

697
00:50:44,999 --> 00:50:46,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Unbelievably powerful.

698
00:50:46,721 --> 00:50:50,383
[SPEAKER_08]: You are now finally the strongest pro team except your challenge.

699
00:50:52,253 --> 00:50:54,478
[SPEAKER_08]: My spirit burns like the sun and I shall dry you like a prune

700
00:51:06,366 --> 00:51:09,688
[SPEAKER_13]: You want to know what's... Alright, next show that we do, I'll tell you what.

701
00:51:10,128 --> 00:51:12,669
[SPEAKER_13]: I will bring the manual for Samurai Shodown.

702
00:51:12,949 --> 00:51:14,450
[SPEAKER_13]: It is the funniest thing ever.

703
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:17,051
[SPEAKER_13]: Because, like, it's completely English the whole time.

704
00:51:17,091 --> 00:51:24,234
[SPEAKER_13]: It talks about Amakusa, who is the bad guy, saying, Amakusa's quest is for world domination and a truly tasty cup of coffee.

705
00:51:26,455 --> 00:51:27,175
[SPEAKER_13]: I kid you not.

706
00:51:28,156 --> 00:51:29,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the ending to Ghosts and Goblins.

707
00:51:30,957 --> 00:51:35,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Being the wise and courage adore... Adore!

708
00:51:36,145 --> 00:51:45,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Night that you are, you feel strong swelling in your body Return to starting point, challenge again Are you full of strong?

709
00:51:48,575 --> 00:51:55,581
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel this strong swelling inside my body Maybe I shouldn't have told you guys that I think you need to see a doctor for that condition

710
00:51:56,172 --> 00:51:57,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Air Fortress Spacey Music

711
00:52:17,282 --> 00:52:22,227
[SPEAKER_08]: On the planet Farmel, they had the glorious days for two centuries.

712
00:52:22,708 --> 00:52:30,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Since the star date had established, they sailed all around the galaxy with new type spaceship called Lightship.

713
00:52:31,057 --> 00:52:34,941
[SPEAKER_08]: But one day the peace was disturbed by a mysterious big fortress.

714
00:52:35,461 --> 00:52:38,585
[SPEAKER_08]: It was living and was destroying all other civilizations.

715
00:52:39,292 --> 00:52:50,236
[SPEAKER_08]: The Federal Bureau of Galactic Government organized the Defense Force immediately, but as the Air Fortress had very high potential, the Defense Sea Force was wiped out in vain.

716
00:52:51,416 --> 00:53:02,440
[SPEAKER_08]: So the Federal Bureau has decided to select a specially trained man, ID-2592 named Hal Bailman, and has developed new type lightbrancer and armored suit.

717
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:07,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Now he departs for the Air Fortress with the destiny of Farmel.

718
00:53:09,622 --> 00:53:11,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Farmel, it sounds like Propel the sequel.

719
00:53:13,383 --> 00:53:15,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Formaldehyde flavored Propel?

720
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:16,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my.

721
00:53:16,963 --> 00:53:21,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's... Is it like a farming planet?

722
00:53:21,904 --> 00:53:22,824
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

723
00:53:22,944 --> 00:53:23,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

724
00:53:24,265 --> 00:53:27,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, they need to learn how to translate shit back into English.

725
00:53:28,786 --> 00:53:30,166
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like a shitty planet.

726
00:53:31,046 --> 00:53:33,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations, the story is happy end.

727
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:33,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

728
00:53:35,627 --> 00:53:36,407
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my favorite.

729
00:53:37,774 --> 00:53:40,436
[SPEAKER_13]: There's lots of other neat stuff on English.com, though.

730
00:53:40,677 --> 00:53:43,639
[SPEAKER_08]: English.com is highly recommended by the staff of Orange Launch Radio.

731
00:53:45,661 --> 00:53:46,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

732
00:53:46,902 --> 00:53:48,083
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to read this one for you.

733
00:53:48,203 --> 00:53:48,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

734
00:53:51,566 --> 00:53:53,107
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, I'm cock.

735
00:53:54,048 --> 00:53:56,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, what kind of world is this?

736
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:57,771
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of crap.

737
00:53:58,111 --> 00:54:05,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

738
00:54:06,673 --> 00:54:08,634
[SPEAKER_05]: His name is Raman Saurus.

739
00:54:08,854 --> 00:54:15,775
[SPEAKER_05]: He is urchin, has many... He is urchin, has many curiosity, but he is a person who makes much good looks.

740
00:54:17,156 --> 00:54:19,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Raman Sauruses have an image to uphold.

741
00:54:21,497 --> 00:54:26,378
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a... Somebody?

742
00:54:27,038 --> 00:54:27,198
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

743
00:54:27,238 --> 00:54:28,079
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you looking for?

744
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:32,760
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that I like the one that has World of Pain on it.

745
00:54:34,324 --> 00:54:35,405
[SPEAKER_13]: and then no smorking.

746
00:54:35,945 --> 00:54:36,666
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, man.

747
00:54:38,927 --> 00:54:40,869
[SPEAKER_13]: This is really, really brilliant radio.

748
00:54:41,229 --> 00:54:41,549
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

749
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:48,354

00:55:23,961 --> 00:55:27,502
[SPEAKER_13]: Every day I polish my revolver and I shoot my head like a rock star.

[SPEAKER_13]: I'm cock, what?

759
00:55:28,923 --> 00:55:30,004
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to read this chick's shirt.

760
00:55:30,024 --> 00:55:30,464
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, I'm cock.

761
00:55:30,564 --> 00:55:31,905
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm home, I'm all alone.

00:55:32,165 --> 00:55:34,346
[SPEAKER_13]: I need some her coffee.

763
00:55:34,366 --> 00:55:34,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Hot coffee.

764
00:55:37,187 --> 00:55:42,030
[SPEAKER_13]: There were three jovial Welshmen as I have some things.

765
00:55:43,177 --> 00:55:45,399
[SPEAKER_08]: and they would go hunting upon St.

766
00:55:45,459 --> 00:56:02,157
[SPEAKER_13]: David's said it was a ship that either he said the chimney blown away or whatever I want the one that says spread beaver showing the vaginal area it says showing the vaginal area

767
00:56:04,553 --> 00:56:04,973
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.

768
00:56:09,194 --> 00:56:10,214
[SPEAKER_13]: Link that one in the chatroom.

769
00:56:14,575 --> 00:56:15,276
[SPEAKER_13]: I want that shirt.

770
00:56:15,696 --> 00:56:16,516
[SPEAKER_13]: I would wear that shirt.

771
00:56:20,397 --> 00:56:25,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Spread Beaver was actually the name of a band in Japan fronted by the ex-Japan guitarist Hide.

772
00:56:26,624 --> 00:56:27,665
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but he's dead now.

773
00:56:28,466 --> 00:56:28,807
[SPEAKER_13]: Is he?

774
00:56:28,887 --> 00:56:29,448
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

775
00:56:30,128 --> 00:56:33,513
[SPEAKER_14]: He hung himself in the door.

776
00:56:33,733 --> 00:56:45,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody said he hung himself, but what I heard is that he, uh, what he actually did was, um, when he practiced his guitar sometimes, he would tie, like, a belt or something around his neck and then tie it to the back of a, um...

777
00:56:45,788 --> 00:56:46,948
[SPEAKER_05]: I have my hideplushie hanging from a doorknob.

778
00:57:10,898 --> 00:57:12,038
[SPEAKER_13]: I bought a hide plushie.

779
00:57:13,299 --> 00:57:15,600
[SPEAKER_13]: He has this string on his head so you can hang him up.

780
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,802
[SPEAKER_13]: So I was hanging it from the doorknob by my finger.

781
00:57:17,822 --> 00:57:24,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because apparently it was tied to the doorknob and that's when they found him or something.

782
00:57:24,766 --> 00:57:26,527
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really disgusting, but it's so funny.

783
00:57:28,328 --> 00:57:30,829
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just, you know, being true to the original.

784
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:32,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man.

785
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:38,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, my JFK plushie has two bullet holes in its head and shoulder.

786
00:57:38,553 --> 00:57:39,054
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.

787
00:57:42,253 --> 00:57:44,454
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, let's listen to music.

788
00:57:44,854 --> 00:57:45,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, let's listen to music.

789
00:57:45,934 --> 00:57:46,695
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to take a quick break.

790
00:57:46,715 --> 00:57:51,456
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to come back and do that one segment we can't get through a show without doing.

791
00:57:52,916 --> 00:57:53,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Fak you, man.

792
00:57:54,477 --> 00:57:57,917
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Jamie's Fak You of the Week and my Fak You of the Week.

793
00:57:57,958 --> 00:57:59,698
[SPEAKER_13]: I know I didn't pick a cake much this morning.

794
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:01,660
[SPEAKER_08]: It's okay, we're not doing a cage match tonight.

795
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:03,060
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck it, I say he's not here.

796
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:03,681
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's do one.

797
00:58:03,941 --> 00:58:05,501
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to do a cage match without Loki?

798
00:58:05,521 --> 00:58:06,262
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll fix it.

799
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:10,444
[SPEAKER_08]: There's hardly... You know what the thing is, though, since we didn't really announce this, because we wanted this to be a treat.

800
00:58:10,484 --> 00:58:14,826
[SPEAKER_08]: For those of you that listen to Orange Homs Radio a lot, we wanted this sneak... A treat, the alternative to spam.

801
00:58:15,046 --> 00:58:24,570
[SPEAKER_08]: This sneak... Yeah, we wanted this sneak preview of what is sure to be a very... Turn off all pagers and cell phones.

[SPEAKER_08]: Dot com.

805
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:31,932
[SPEAKER_08]: We wanted this to be a special treat for those of you who listen to Orange Limes a lot to get to hear this show like before everyone else.

806
00:58:32,772 --> 00:58:33,713
[SPEAKER_08]: And aren't you happy?

807
00:58:35,394 --> 00:58:38,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so we don't have a lot of people available to vote, but we can do one anyway.

808
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:40,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes?

809
00:58:40,776 --> 00:58:53,401
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that we should do... What is this?

810
00:58:53,502 --> 00:58:54,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Guess My Cell Phone?

811
00:58:59,718 --> 00:59:00,559
[SPEAKER_13]: Fucked Up Trivia or something.

812
00:59:17,824 --> 00:59:43,313

[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm entertaining

814
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:50,909
[SPEAKER_08]: It was either that or this one.

815
01:00:00,073 --> 01:00:03,215
[SPEAKER_20]: I haven't played that in forever.

816
01:00:03,595 --> 01:00:04,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway... No.

01:00:43,488 --> 01:00:45,268
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll be back with the FAQs of the week.

01:01:11,046 --> 01:01:14,651
[SPEAKER_19]: Before there were words, communication was done through teeth.

835
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,574
[SPEAKER_19]: Body language is controlled by rhythm.

836
01:01:16,614 --> 01:01:18,456
Music is the universal link.

837
01:01:18,577 --> 01:01:19,678
Feel this, feel these.

838
01:01:19,718 --> 01:01:19,959
Huh, huh.

[SPEAKER_20]: Monkey Magic Monkey Magic Monkey Magic Monkey Magic

848
01:08:30,537 --> 01:08:32,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Bitch, get a new song.

849
01:08:32,939 --> 01:08:35,440
[SPEAKER_03]: An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

850
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:37,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Funny enough, she never did find a new song.

851
01:08:37,942 --> 01:08:39,603
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't heard from Joga in a long, long time.

852
01:08:39,643 --> 01:08:39,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Good.

853
01:08:41,238 --> 01:08:42,319
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what's interesting?

854
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:43,079
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't... I don't... Okay.

855
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:03,285
[SPEAKER_08]: We've talked about her on the show before, this Japanese rocker girl chick who's awesome.

856
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:03,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Her name's Kana.

857
01:09:04,646 --> 01:09:08,310
[SPEAKER_13]: She would play Miku if you have it.

858
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:09,171
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I might.

859
01:09:09,211 --> 01:09:09,992
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you've sent it to me.

860
01:09:10,072 --> 01:09:12,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I have a point to this.

861
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:20,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Our new friend Garrett, who we discovered randomly on a 2DX machine four weeks ago, and we just kind of picked him up and made him come home with us and play with us.

862
01:09:21,103 --> 01:09:23,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Not like that, you perverts.

863
01:09:23,785 --> 01:09:30,188
[SPEAKER_08]: I was showing him Kana videos the other night, and he was just laughing his ass off going, this is great, she's kind of like the Japanese Bjork.

864
01:09:31,369 --> 01:09:33,530
[SPEAKER_08]: And I had a point to this story, but I don't remember what it was.

865
01:09:36,324 --> 01:09:37,666
[SPEAKER_20]: I have a question.

866
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:40,208
[SPEAKER_14]: Was she from a band originally?

867
01:09:40,228 --> 01:09:41,870
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think so.

868
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:44,773
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I guess she was from some other band.

869
01:09:44,853 --> 01:09:48,256
[SPEAKER_14]: She does the elegant... Gothic Lolita stuff?

870
01:09:48,276 --> 01:09:48,416
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

871
01:09:48,436 --> 01:09:48,616
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

872
01:09:59,206 --> 01:10:02,189
[SPEAKER_05]: I like when she's got a little panda thing.

873
01:10:02,289 --> 01:10:03,750
[SPEAKER_13]: And she does panda bondage.

874
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:07,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, she does a lot of panda bondage, which is really weird, because they don't rate pandas, do you?

875
01:10:08,014 --> 01:10:10,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Poor pandas, they're like, you know... They don't even rate the pandas.

876
01:10:10,857 --> 01:10:13,219
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just wrapped in ribbons and bondaged it.

877
01:10:13,239 --> 01:10:16,321
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, the WWF... Ribbon!

878
01:10:17,796 --> 01:10:18,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Rick, what?

879
01:10:18,356 --> 01:10:18,736
[SPEAKER_14]: Ribbon.

880
01:10:18,957 --> 01:10:19,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Ribbon?

881
01:10:20,397 --> 01:10:20,817
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorted!

882
01:10:22,038 --> 01:10:22,558
[SPEAKER_14]: Arrowed.

883
01:10:23,478 --> 01:10:24,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Ordinate.

884
01:10:24,699 --> 01:10:24,959
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

885
01:10:25,539 --> 01:10:25,839
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

886
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:27,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my.

887
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:30,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie's lost her... Jamie's lost her mind.

888
01:10:31,082 --> 01:10:32,182
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever.

889
01:10:32,742 --> 01:10:32,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

890
01:10:33,523 --> 01:10:36,324
[SPEAKER_05]: But for some reason I thought she was from, like, Malice Miser, but that's Gak, I think.

891
01:10:37,416 --> 01:10:37,877
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, this is bad.

892
01:10:37,937 --> 01:10:38,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, this is bad.

893
01:10:38,497 --> 01:10:39,137
[SPEAKER_13]: Here is justice.

894
01:11:05,794 --> 01:11:10,756
[SPEAKER_20]: Here is my butt.

895
01:11:11,516 --> 01:11:16,798
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, my typhus relief goes to my back for fucking hurting.

896
01:11:16,818 --> 01:11:17,999
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck it.

897
01:11:18,859 --> 01:11:19,680
[SPEAKER_13]: It hurts a lot.

898
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,461
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been hurting me for like two weeks now and I've been thinking about getting it for it.

899
01:11:23,641 --> 01:11:25,582
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have, um, there's a

900
01:11:26,354 --> 01:11:27,895
[SPEAKER_13]: Other crap now that I'm going to take.

901
01:11:28,235 --> 01:11:31,977
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have this heat pad attached to my butt.

902
01:11:32,117 --> 01:11:33,438
[SPEAKER_13]: It's sort of like in my pants.

903
01:11:34,459 --> 01:11:37,100
[SPEAKER_13]: It's those ones that you wrap around your stomach.

904
01:11:37,881 --> 01:11:39,742
[SPEAKER_13]: Except I couldn't get it to sit low enough.

905
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:45,625
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just tore the velcro parts off and stuck it in my pants.

906
01:11:46,105 --> 01:11:47,246
[SPEAKER_13]: So now it's warm.

907
01:11:47,686 --> 01:11:49,007
[SPEAKER_13]: My back is warm.

908
01:11:49,287 --> 01:11:50,528
[SPEAKER_13]: My lower back is warm.

909
01:11:50,908 --> 01:11:52,749
[SPEAKER_13]: But still, it hurts like fuck.

910
01:11:53,930 --> 01:11:54,590
[SPEAKER_13]: It hurts like...

911
01:11:56,388 --> 01:11:57,129
[SPEAKER_13]: Fondage Pops.

912
01:11:58,389 --> 01:11:59,310
[SPEAKER_13]: It hurts.

913
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:02,132
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

914
01:12:02,252 --> 01:12:05,354
[SPEAKER_13]: My other fucky again goes to Squeenix for sucking.

915
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:36,392
[SPEAKER_13]: and another one goes toward having no money so I can't have my games right now and a happy fuck you goes to the ending of Final Fantasy X-2 which I'm not going to spoil for anybody but I like it but there needs to be more and also a fuck you again goes toward Final Fantasy X-2 for having a freaking confusing ass storyline so I guess I'm not going to get it until I actually play through the game

916
01:12:37,632 --> 01:12:43,574
[SPEAKER_13]: and, um, another one goes toward not really having any more and not getting that one.

917
01:12:43,594 --> 01:12:46,935
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, because I've had salad today and that's it.

918
01:12:47,455 --> 01:12:51,036
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah, another funky goes toward not being able to digest anything.

919
01:12:52,556 --> 01:12:53,456
[SPEAKER_08]: That was beautiful, thank you.

920
01:12:53,476 --> 01:12:59,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I have some FUs this week.

921
01:12:59,618 --> 01:13:03,399
[SPEAKER_08]: My biggest FU this week goes to procrastination.

922
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:06,621
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys have seen the house, right?

923
01:13:06,741 --> 01:13:08,142
[SPEAKER_08]: And what's happening on Saturday?

924
01:13:08,823 --> 01:13:09,363
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm moving.

925
01:13:09,443 --> 01:13:09,984
[SPEAKER_08]: You're moving.

926
01:13:10,204 --> 01:13:12,246
[SPEAKER_08]: How many boxes have you seen that have been packed?

927
01:13:13,386 --> 01:13:13,647
[SPEAKER_08]: None.

928
01:13:13,827 --> 01:13:15,068
[SPEAKER_08]: There's one in the living room.

929
01:13:15,208 --> 01:13:15,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I didn't see.

930
01:13:17,249 --> 01:13:18,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, uh-oh.

931
01:13:18,490 --> 01:13:19,351
[SPEAKER_05]: What have you got there, Rob?

932
01:13:19,371 --> 01:13:24,195
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I was given an interesting strategy on how to pack my shit because... Oh, that sounds dirty.

933
01:13:24,815 --> 01:13:31,420
[SPEAKER_08]: I was given an interesting strategy on how to pack stuff up... Wait, hold on.

934
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:31,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on.

935
01:13:32,081 --> 01:13:32,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop the presses.

936
01:13:32,821 --> 01:13:33,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop the presses.

937
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:34,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie has a joke.

938
01:13:39,730 --> 01:13:46,212
[SPEAKER_13]: If California were going to fall off into the ocean and everyone had to evacuate to an island, who do you think would be out first, the lesbians or the gay men?

939
01:13:48,752 --> 01:13:50,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, the gay men.

940
01:13:51,033 --> 01:13:54,733
[SPEAKER_13]: Wrong, because the gay men would still be packing their shit while the lesbians are out looking to be split.

941
01:13:56,374 --> 01:14:01,275
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a good joke.

942
01:14:01,295 --> 01:14:03,375
[SPEAKER_08]: My next FU of the week goes to bad jokes.

943
01:14:06,748 --> 01:14:08,553
[SPEAKER_14]: Heard it in the taxi cab in Vegas.

944
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:11,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Were you drunk?

945
01:14:11,162 --> 01:14:12,305
[SPEAKER_05]: God bless Vegas.

946
01:14:13,706 --> 01:14:14,747
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I might have been.

947
01:14:15,287 --> 01:14:24,153
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I was, because it was with me and Iguana Girl and Islander coming back from Circus Circus being drunk off Warp Core Breaches.

948
01:14:25,333 --> 01:14:26,594
[SPEAKER_13]: Playing drunk DVRs.

949
01:14:28,055 --> 01:14:31,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, anyway, I procrastinated and I haven't packed a damn thing yet and I'm moving on Saturday.

950
01:14:32,438 --> 01:14:34,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, no, if you go out in my garage, I have a lot of shit in boxes.

951
01:14:34,959 --> 01:14:35,820
[SPEAKER_08]: I really do, but you know why?

952
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:37,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I never unpacked last time.

953
01:14:37,881 --> 01:14:38,761
[SPEAKER_13]: That sounds like my house.

954
01:14:38,801 --> 01:14:39,702
[SPEAKER_13]: You saw my closet.

955
01:14:39,782 --> 01:14:40,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.

956
01:14:41,103 --> 01:14:42,723
[SPEAKER_08]: So, moving isn't going to be so bad.

957
01:14:42,743 --> 01:14:45,245
[SPEAKER_08]: I just have to pack this up, my bed up, my clothes.

958
01:14:45,265 --> 01:14:46,885
[SPEAKER_08]: All my clothes are going to be the hardest one, but that'll be easy.

959
01:14:47,626 --> 01:14:51,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Anywho, I had an interesting strategy sent to me on how to pack my stuff.

960
01:14:52,088 --> 01:14:54,069
[SPEAKER_08]: And this was sent to me by Garrett, same guy we were talking about earlier.

961
01:14:54,309 --> 01:15:03,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Get some big boxes and do something like label my boxes, upper right part of closet, lower left part of closet, shit on the floor in living room, and then fill them up accordingly.

962
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:04,894
[SPEAKER_20]: That's how I pack.

963
01:15:07,506 --> 01:15:09,367
[SPEAKER_14]: I have another question.

964
01:15:10,527 --> 01:15:11,887
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I got bit by a spider.

965
01:15:13,548 --> 01:15:14,348
[SPEAKER_08]: On your cleavage.

966
01:15:15,948 --> 01:15:17,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Or your, if you're, you know, French.

967
01:15:19,029 --> 01:15:19,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Cleavage.

968
01:15:20,049 --> 01:15:22,190
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I got bit by a spider, so fuck that spider!

969
01:15:22,530 --> 01:15:26,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie's gonna go get her cleavage wet.

970
01:15:26,731 --> 01:15:27,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Cleavage.

971
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:32,112
[SPEAKER_08]: In the meantime, do I have any FUs left?

972
01:15:33,133 --> 01:15:33,293
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

973
01:15:33,953 --> 01:15:34,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Brad's turn.

974
01:15:38,499 --> 01:15:39,600
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you always give me this?

975
01:15:40,141 --> 01:15:42,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's cute.

976
01:15:42,184 --> 01:15:43,445
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fuck you music.

977
01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:43,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

978
01:15:46,509 --> 01:15:51,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a fuck you, but my mind is rumbling because I just got a phone call.

979
01:15:51,215 --> 01:15:51,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

980
01:15:53,938 --> 01:15:54,959
[SPEAKER_05]: What were we just talking about?

981
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:55,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

982
01:15:56,977 --> 01:16:00,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes, we were talking about Jamie's Breastises.

983
01:16:00,318 --> 01:16:18,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, no, fuck you goes to people, and no offense, Jamie, but fuck you goes to people who spoil games for themselves, and waiting... No, for themselves, I mean, like, instead of waiting till the game comes out, they, like, read about the story, and Jamie's like, I'm getting the game anyway.

984
01:16:19,024 --> 01:16:20,325
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm poor, I can't have the game.

985
01:16:21,025 --> 01:16:22,065
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have an architecture.

986
01:16:22,085 --> 01:16:22,145
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

987
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:27,363
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had something else, but I don't remember, so I want to eat.

988
01:16:27,383 --> 01:16:27,843
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hungry.

989
01:16:27,963 --> 01:16:29,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

990
01:16:30,065 --> 01:16:31,967
[SPEAKER_14]: Say we fuck the show.

991
01:16:34,049 --> 01:16:36,091
[SPEAKER_08]: If we can make it through another half hour, I know we can.

992
01:16:36,672 --> 01:16:37,552
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can get to two hours.

993
01:16:37,592 --> 01:16:43,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, we do have a present for the last hour of the show, so we'll get to that later.

994
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:44,459
[SPEAKER_08]: A gift.

995
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:45,400
[SPEAKER_14]: We're making a gift.

996
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,282
[SPEAKER_13]: We've made a gift.

997
01:16:47,362 --> 01:16:48,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, Jamie made a gift.

998
01:16:48,991 --> 01:16:49,792
[SPEAKER_13]: Fag Hags Community

999
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:21,070
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking because Puppy sent me an interesting FU.

1000
01:17:21,090 --> 01:17:22,311
[SPEAKER_08]: It involves a web link.

1001
01:17:23,192 --> 01:17:24,553
[SPEAKER_08]: And he might have already deleted it.

1002
01:17:25,394 --> 01:17:29,899
[SPEAKER_08]: He wants to give a big FU to somebody that posted something naughty in his girlfriend's journal.

1003
01:17:30,019 --> 01:17:30,780
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm loading that up.

1004
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:31,881
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll come back to his FU.

1005
01:17:32,342 --> 01:17:33,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to Zero's FUs.

1006
01:17:34,988 --> 01:17:36,869
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to not being able to be there tonight.

1007
01:17:37,109 --> 01:17:37,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we're at zero.

1008
01:17:37,989 --> 01:17:38,489
[SPEAKER_08]: We miss you.

1009
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:42,531
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to my legs giving out in the middle of Legend of Max all three times.

1010
01:17:42,751 --> 01:17:46,152
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to my ass hurting as I fall to the ground on Legend of Max.

1011
01:17:46,852 --> 01:17:50,234
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to stupid assholes who think because they live in my house they can fuck shit up.

1012
01:17:50,674 --> 01:17:52,675
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, I think we can use those boxes.

1013
01:17:54,195 --> 01:17:56,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop trying to get people to buy your fucking alcohol.

1014
01:17:56,216 --> 01:17:57,736
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I will turn your stupid ass in.

1015
01:17:58,117 --> 01:18:01,918
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkChild says, fuck you to the stupid 17-year-old girl who keeps calling me.

1016
01:18:03,027 --> 01:18:05,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Although it would have been smarter to have given her the wrong phone number.

1017
01:18:06,048 --> 01:18:06,868
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, you know what?

1018
01:18:07,468 --> 01:18:08,389
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to talk to her.

1019
01:18:08,909 --> 01:18:11,230
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me talk to her.

1020
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:13,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Better yet, let's talk to her live on air.

1021
01:18:13,971 --> 01:18:14,571
[SPEAKER_13]: Get her number.

1022
01:18:14,611 --> 01:18:15,411
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll call her.

1023
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:17,912
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll find a way to tape the conversation.

1024
01:18:20,533 --> 01:18:24,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Dark Tetsuya would like to say, Fuck not knowing what to do with crushes indeed.

1025
01:18:24,534 --> 01:18:27,195
[SPEAKER_08]: And for Angel, fuck having to work and missing the surprise.

1026
01:18:30,757 --> 01:18:32,458
[SPEAKER_08]: I know what you mean a little bit, actually.

1027
01:18:33,078 --> 01:18:38,280
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually know what you mean very well.

1028
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:40,361
[SPEAKER_08]: John Fields would like to say, Hey!

1029
01:18:40,381 --> 01:18:40,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey!

1030
01:18:40,701 --> 01:18:41,521
[SPEAKER_08]: The wizard rules!

1031
01:18:41,541 --> 01:18:41,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on.

1032
01:18:55,836 --> 01:19:00,779
[SPEAKER_05]: The Wizard, all those games, or movies, Double Dragon, you know, all sucked ass.

1033
01:19:01,759 --> 01:19:03,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I haven't seen The Wizard, so I guess I shouldn't judge it.

1034
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:06,482
[SPEAKER_05]: But Resident Evil was probably the best.

1035
01:19:07,344 --> 01:19:09,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Video game to movie production ever.

1036
01:19:10,346 --> 01:19:25,554
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they're going to start doing, because movie producers and directors are starting to notice this kind of stuff is becoming popular, like the comic book movies, the big budget comic book movies that are coming out, I think they're going to do pretty good with the Metroid movie.

1037
01:19:25,634 --> 01:19:27,055
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping.

1038
01:19:27,916 --> 01:19:31,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man, it would suck if Drew Barrymore was Samus or something.

1039
01:19:31,478 --> 01:19:32,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

1040
01:19:33,279 --> 01:19:33,639
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1041
01:19:37,225 --> 01:19:41,707
[SPEAKER_08]: I was looking for my Power Glove, it's so bad quote, but I lost it, I'm so mad.

1042
01:19:43,068 --> 01:19:43,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh well, anyway.

1043
01:19:44,649 --> 01:19:44,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, what?

1044
01:19:48,671 --> 01:19:49,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

1045
01:19:50,712 --> 01:19:54,835
[SPEAKER_08]: For now, I have to change their song, hold on, Jamie's requesting I change the FU song for the chatroom.

1046
01:19:55,235 --> 01:20:04,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Load, load, load, load, load, load.

1047
01:20:08,126 --> 01:20:08,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, this is happy.

1048
01:20:08,887 --> 01:20:09,507
[SPEAKER_08]: I like this one.

1049
01:20:14,151 --> 01:20:15,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, this is good FU music.

1050
01:20:15,312 --> 01:20:15,733
[SPEAKER_08]: I like this.

1051
01:20:17,154 --> 01:20:18,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's move on.

1052
01:20:18,195 --> 01:20:21,898
[SPEAKER_08]: The 23rd Magus would like to say, FU to my screwy school schedule next week.

1053
01:20:22,418 --> 01:20:28,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone else has to take their stupid little tests, which leaves me in government class for five hours with no bathroom passes.

1054
01:20:29,064 --> 01:20:29,624
[SPEAKER_08]: What the fuck?

1055
01:20:30,305 --> 01:20:31,946
[SPEAKER_08]: FU to Angel's screwy work schedule.

1056
01:20:32,407 --> 01:20:32,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Fet.

1057
01:20:33,866 --> 01:20:39,791
[SPEAKER_08]: FU to having random DDRs at school begging me to take them to an Orange Lawns broadcast, which I will do, so fear.

1058
01:20:40,491 --> 01:20:41,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, sure you will.

1059
01:20:42,213 --> 01:20:42,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Out.

1060
01:20:44,114 --> 01:20:46,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Brack2000 would like to say FU to sore throats.

1061
01:20:46,836 --> 01:20:49,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything tastes like, um, sore throats.

1062
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:53,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Chloroseptic is your friend.

1063
01:20:58,665 --> 01:21:03,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'm going back to puppies FU, but the damn page isn't loading because LiveJournal's being a biznatch.

1064
01:21:17,985 --> 01:21:19,946
[SPEAKER_08]: God, it's the stupid tub girl thing.

1065
01:21:20,046 --> 01:21:21,447
[SPEAKER_08]: God damn it, why'd you have to show that?

1066
01:21:21,807 --> 01:21:23,087
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't even let the whole thing load.

1067
01:21:23,227 --> 01:21:28,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Like 20 pixels of it came up, I recognized it as being disgusting, and I flipped it off.

1068
01:21:30,830 --> 01:21:31,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Stupid kids!

1069
01:21:31,751 --> 01:21:33,451
[SPEAKER_13]: How can people pee me that color?

1070
01:21:34,612 --> 01:21:36,152
[SPEAKER_13]: She must have been eating something.

1071
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:37,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Easy, it's Photoshop.

1072
01:21:40,074 --> 01:21:41,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Goatse was funny.

1073
01:21:41,795 --> 01:21:44,416
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the color of the Walmart that's on the corner of Arden and...

1074
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:47,215
[SPEAKER_13]: Not Walmart, Walgreens.

1075
01:21:47,756 --> 01:21:48,857
[SPEAKER_13]: It's by the mall.

1076
01:21:49,317 --> 01:21:51,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me think of when Goat Say was funny.

1077
01:21:51,098 --> 01:21:52,720
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was about five minutes.

1078
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:53,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Never.

1079
01:22:00,986 --> 01:22:01,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Shame on you, puppy.

1080
01:22:01,947 --> 01:22:02,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Bad puppy.

1081
01:22:04,029 --> 01:22:05,750
[SPEAKER_08]: That's me beating puppy with a newspaper.

1082
01:22:06,951 --> 01:22:07,952
[SPEAKER_14]: Bad puppy.

1083
01:22:09,493 --> 01:22:11,275
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just that fucking tub girl.

1084
01:22:13,636 --> 01:22:14,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Gross.

1085
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Rose, yeah, now I'm not hungry.

1086
01:22:16,781 --> 01:22:17,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1087
01:22:17,542 --> 01:22:18,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you know what?

1088
01:22:18,923 --> 01:22:19,703
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck you, man.

1089
01:22:22,005 --> 01:22:23,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Back you to Black Lab.

1090
01:22:26,888 --> 01:22:27,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kidding.

1091
01:22:27,749 --> 01:22:28,490
[SPEAKER_08]: We love Black Lab.

1092
01:22:29,150 --> 01:22:29,570
[SPEAKER_13]: For dinner.

1093
01:22:31,932 --> 01:22:32,973
[SPEAKER_13]: Mmm, fried puppy.

1094
01:22:35,454 --> 01:22:38,817
[SPEAKER_05]: I think at that Genghis Kong Mongolian barbecue I had some puppies there.

1095
01:22:39,577 --> 01:22:40,438
[SPEAKER_05]: You're mean.

1096
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:44,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Puppy says it was more than that.

1097
01:22:46,073 --> 01:22:46,853
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, fuck you.

1098
01:22:47,854 --> 01:22:48,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't.

1099
01:22:48,194 --> 01:22:49,194
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck you goes to my pants.

1100
01:22:49,274 --> 01:22:51,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's a 20-picture montage.

1101
01:22:52,795 --> 01:22:53,215
God.

1102
01:22:53,755 --> 01:22:54,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, look away.

1103
01:22:54,715 --> 01:22:55,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's your chance.

1104
01:22:57,356 --> 01:22:59,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, that means, like, everybody's watching now.

1105
01:23:02,958 --> 01:23:03,958
[SPEAKER_13]: Who the hell did it?

1106
01:23:05,198 --> 01:23:05,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's gone.

1107
01:23:06,279 --> 01:23:07,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Puppy deleted it.

1108
01:23:08,079 --> 01:23:09,520
[SPEAKER_13]: Who the fuck did that anyway?

1109
01:23:09,980 --> 01:23:11,040
[SPEAKER_13]: No, let me know who did it.

1110
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:13,381
[SPEAKER_13]: Save their ID.

1111
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:14,281
[SPEAKER_08]: It was anonymous.

1112
01:23:15,524 --> 01:23:16,605
[SPEAKER_13]: You can IP track them.

1113
01:23:17,005 --> 01:23:18,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you should log IPs.

1114
01:23:19,026 --> 01:23:19,786
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how I track them.

1115
01:23:19,806 --> 01:23:21,807
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to plot some revenge, get with Jamie.

1116
01:23:22,708 --> 01:23:23,208
[SPEAKER_13]: I've done it.

1117
01:23:23,468 --> 01:23:24,109
[SPEAKER_13]: I have done it.

1118
01:23:24,369 --> 01:23:30,072
[SPEAKER_13]: And there are ways you can trace somebody down to their zip code to find out where they live by their IP address.

1119
01:23:30,752 --> 01:23:31,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie's a geek.

1120
01:23:34,214 --> 01:23:34,614
[SPEAKER_08]: In a good way.

1121
01:23:35,835 --> 01:23:42,358
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how I knew who it was, that it wasn't, you know, who spammed my live journal.

1122
01:23:42,438 --> 01:23:43,299
[SPEAKER_13]: It was his friend that did it.

1123
01:23:43,579 --> 01:23:43,779
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, okay.

1124
01:23:46,067 --> 01:23:50,815
[SPEAKER_08]: It was anonymous and their IP tracking wasn't turned on.

1125
01:23:51,256 --> 01:23:52,598
[SPEAKER_08]: So now's a good time to turn that on.

1126
01:23:52,638 --> 01:23:55,123
[SPEAKER_13]: Turn on the IP tracking and disallow anonymous posting.

1127
01:23:58,769 --> 01:24:00,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, let's take a break.

1128
01:24:00,810 --> 01:24:01,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Another break.

1129
01:24:01,430 --> 01:24:08,152
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll be back and we'll wrap up kind of like this segment of the show and then we're going to move into another segment of the show.

1130
01:24:08,652 --> 01:24:09,552
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be interesting.

1131
01:24:09,592 --> 01:24:10,973
[SPEAKER_08]: We're experimental tonight.

1132
01:24:11,313 --> 01:24:13,914
[SPEAKER_08]: We aren't live, but you should still come into the chat room.

[SPEAKER_18]: We're live right now.

[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we're live on Thursday.

1135

[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, right now we're live.

1136
01:24:16,835 --> 01:24:17,875
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's Thursday, we're live.

1137
01:24:17,915 --> 01:24:18,675
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's Sunday, we're not.

1138
01:24:18,895 --> 01:24:20,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, no, because we rebroadcast.

1139
01:24:20,896 --> 01:24:22,256

[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck it.

1143
01:24:24,857 --> 01:24:25,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Either we're live or we're not.

1144
01:24:25,957 --> 01:24:27,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Just go to the chat room and they'll tell you.

01:30:18,942 --> 01:30:22,463
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't hear it, but I'm going to guess it's the Healing Vision Angelic Wings.

01:31:17,934 --> 01:31:18,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1193
01:31:19,797 --> 01:31:20,880

[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I know.

1195
01:31:22,904 --> 01:31:23,604
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to do a cage match.

01:31:23,624 --> 01:31:25,225
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to do a cage match?

1197

1199
01:31:28,126 --> 01:31:29,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so we're going to do a cage match.

1200
01:31:29,367 --> 01:31:32,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki agreed his song sucked, so we're throwing it out and we're starting new.

1201
01:31:32,708 --> 01:31:33,988
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a new cage match.

1202
01:31:34,569 --> 01:31:37,830
[SPEAKER_08]: And in this week's cage match, I have to dig a little bit for Jamie's song.

1203
01:31:37,850 --> 01:31:39,391
[SPEAKER_08]: And I haven't even picked one yet.

1204
01:31:39,431 --> 01:31:41,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you remember what week we did it?

1205
01:31:41,271 --> 01:31:42,672
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't you usually copy them to your hard drive?

1206
01:31:42,992 --> 01:31:44,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Not anymore because that hard drive is full.

1207
01:31:44,533 --> 01:31:47,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just keep that one in there.

1208
01:31:50,942 --> 01:31:51,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Talk about something.

1209
01:31:51,883 --> 01:31:53,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Talk about sex or something.

1210
01:31:54,705 --> 01:31:57,106
[SPEAKER_13]: I like bananas.

1211
01:31:57,767 --> 01:32:04,151
[SPEAKER_13]: There was actually something about this one research group saying that bananas, as we know them, are going to be extinct in a few years.

1212
01:32:04,631 --> 01:32:05,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

1213
01:32:05,052 --> 01:32:07,293
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we bleed them out.

1214
01:32:07,613 --> 01:32:08,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

1215
01:32:08,054 --> 01:32:12,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they stick them up their vaginas.

1216
01:32:13,197 --> 01:32:13,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

1217
01:32:13,597 --> 01:32:15,178
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be really interesting to throw them in.

1218
01:32:16,379 --> 01:32:16,739
[SPEAKER_13]: Why?

1219
01:32:16,759 --> 01:32:17,980
[SPEAKER_13]: Then they stick them up their ass.

1220
01:32:18,541 --> 01:32:18,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

1221
01:32:18,981 --> 01:32:19,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

1222
01:32:20,546 --> 01:32:21,707
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, Rob, you tell us.

1223
01:32:22,247 --> 01:32:22,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

1224
01:32:24,008 --> 01:32:25,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Say something.

1225
01:32:26,769 --> 01:32:29,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Something.

1226
01:32:29,370 --> 01:32:29,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Rap?

1227
01:32:29,891 --> 01:32:30,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1228
01:32:32,732 --> 01:32:35,914
[SPEAKER_05]: I am here, and my name is Chaos.

1229
01:32:36,034 --> 01:32:41,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I found Jamie's... I found the song that Jamie was trying to do, so let's get this show on the road.

1230
01:32:41,176 --> 01:32:45,819
[SPEAKER_13]: This is Cage Match without Loki, version 2.5.

1231
01:32:47,239 --> 01:32:48,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight's Cage Match.

1232
01:32:49,907 --> 01:32:56,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Last week in the cage match, the duck song won again, but fuck it, because Loki wants to pull it because it sucks.

1233
01:32:56,932 --> 01:32:59,634
[SPEAKER_08]: So instead, we have new contenders tonight.

1234
01:33:00,214 --> 01:33:04,837
[SPEAKER_08]: The first one being a song called... Well, Jamie, you ought to introduce this.

1235
01:33:04,857 --> 01:33:06,399
[SPEAKER_13]: Born to Bone, the Sandbone Trio.

1236
01:33:06,879 --> 01:33:07,599
[SPEAKER_08]: And what's it from?

1237
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:08,920
[SPEAKER_13]: From Guitar Man.

1238
01:33:09,441 --> 01:33:10,221
[SPEAKER_08]: And why do you like it?

1239
01:33:10,241 --> 01:33:11,682
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it's fucking rules.

1240
01:33:11,942 --> 01:33:14,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, here it is, first entry tonight, so we're going to do it on the cage match.

1241
01:33:14,564 --> 01:33:15,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Born to be Bone.

1242
01:33:36,126 --> 01:33:36,830
Thanks for watching!

1243
01:36:58,601 --> 01:37:00,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay, it's mariachi-rific.

1244
01:37:00,402 --> 01:37:02,342
[SPEAKER_08]: I was born to be bone, the Sandbone Trio.

1245
01:37:03,063 --> 01:37:04,943
[SPEAKER_08]: First song in tonight's Orange Lounge Cage Match.

1246
01:37:05,784 --> 01:37:07,024
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you think of that one, Jamie?

1247
01:37:07,184 --> 01:37:07,504
[SPEAKER_13]: Nine.

1248
01:37:08,445 --> 01:37:08,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

1249
01:37:09,605 --> 01:37:11,146
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it's cool.

1250
01:37:13,426 --> 01:37:17,468
[SPEAKER_05]: That's probably my favorite song on that whole soundtrack, so I'm going to give it a nine.

1251
01:37:19,310 --> 01:37:24,554
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that song, but I think if it wins too many weeks in a row, I'm going to get sick of it really fast.

1252
01:37:24,694 --> 01:37:27,876
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I'll give it a good score this week, but next week it gets a crappy score.

1253
01:37:28,717 --> 01:37:29,918
[SPEAKER_08]: So this week it gets 8.5.

1254
01:37:29,958 --> 01:37:33,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, son of a bitch.

1255
01:37:34,962 --> 01:37:35,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-oh.

1256
01:37:35,422 --> 01:37:38,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sorry, I just put in a CD that went to an extended CD.

1257
01:37:38,484 --> 01:37:40,646
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's not going to let you read the track data either.

1258
01:37:41,387 --> 01:37:42,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh shit, it won't, huh?

1259
01:37:42,868 --> 01:37:43,108
[SPEAKER_13]: Nope.

1260
01:37:47,521 --> 01:37:48,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, son of a bitch.

1261
01:37:49,682 --> 01:37:50,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, I know another way.

1262
01:37:50,382 --> 01:37:51,362
[SPEAKER_08]: I know a way around it, I think.

1263
01:37:53,603 --> 01:37:57,404
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to pick my cage match song, and we're kind of doing this live on air.

1264
01:37:57,485 --> 01:37:58,345
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of ran out.

1265
01:37:58,365 --> 01:38:00,986
[SPEAKER_08]: I just changed my mind at the last minute about what I wanted to play.

1266
01:38:01,446 --> 01:38:02,866
[SPEAKER_08]: So I ran out to get it.

1267
01:38:04,187 --> 01:38:06,688
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to see if I can get this to go.

1268
01:38:09,709 --> 01:38:09,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1269
01:38:09,809 --> 01:38:10,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1270
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:14,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me just one second, and I'm going to get my... One!

1271
01:38:15,249 --> 01:38:16,130
[SPEAKER_13]: One second!

1272
01:38:16,351 --> 01:38:16,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, here we go.

1273
01:38:18,641 --> 01:38:21,202
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I got it, so I'm gonna make sure this broadcasts.

1274
01:38:21,242 --> 01:38:21,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, my pick.

1275
01:38:22,483 --> 01:38:32,426
[SPEAKER_08]: She got my FU of the week last week, but this week I'm putting her in the cage match because, well, I don't think any song I put in stands a chance against Sandbone Trio, so why not lose big?

1276
01:38:32,686 --> 01:38:46,372
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna put in Madonna, and this is a brand new track from her new album, and it's not American Life, the lead single, because you guys are probably worn out on that by now, but it's another track, and to me, the track is actually a bit Beatmania-ish to me, which is kind of why I like it.

1277
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:46,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1278
01:38:47,612 --> 01:39:01,045
[SPEAKER_08]: and because it kind of progresses and it's a little silly the lyrics are kind of silly but it's an interesting song I think you guys might like it it's called Mother and Father and this is going to be my cage match pick for tonight and hopefully it plays for you guys otherwise I'm going to have to change it so let's try it

1279
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:39,205
[SPEAKER_20]: There was a time I was happy in my life There was a time I believed I'd live forever There was a time that I prayed to Jesus Christ There was a time I had a mother, it was nice

1280
01:40:01,701 --> 01:40:16,627
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm trying hard to dry my tears Yes, father, you know I'm not so free I got to give it up Find someone to love me I got to let it go

1281
01:40:34,418 --> 01:40:56,034
[SPEAKER_20]: I got to give it up, find someone to rely on me I got to let it go, find someone that I can care for There was a time I was happy in my life

1282
01:40:56,812 --> 01:40:57,913
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura.com

1283
01:41:43,411 --> 01:41:44,759
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

1284
01:42:13,956 --> 01:42:34,534
[SPEAKER_20]: I would never meet another person, never turn my heart into a cage, a victim of a kind of rage I got to give it up, I got to give it up Find someone to light me up Find someone that I can care for I got to give it up, find someone

1285
01:42:47,474 --> 01:42:48,810
Thank you for watching!

1286
01:43:36,431 --> 01:43:36,871
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

1287
01:43:37,171 --> 01:43:38,793
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Mother and Father by Madonna.

1288
01:43:42,195 --> 01:43:48,939
[SPEAKER_14]: So, let's get... The end sounds like you ate a burrito and farted.

1289
01:43:49,139 --> 01:43:52,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get reaction from the room on Mother and Father by Madonna.

1290
01:43:52,701 --> 01:43:54,222
[SPEAKER_13]: She's done much better.

1291
01:43:54,843 --> 01:43:56,924
[SPEAKER_13]: I give it a 7, maybe.

1292
01:43:58,925 --> 01:43:59,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Brad?

1293
01:43:59,686 --> 01:44:03,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Since I haven't heard really anything besides the single from the CD...

1294
01:44:06,696 --> 01:44:25,392
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the single better than this, I guess I shouldn't compare it By itself, it's pretty good, but it's, yeah, she has it better, so I'd give it like a 5 or 6, probably 6 I like it, the reason why I picked this song, you know what, the more, now that I'm listening to it in the context of this program That really was a shitty Cage Max pick

1295
01:44:26,357 --> 01:44:28,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it doesn't stand very well on its own.

1296
01:44:28,739 --> 01:44:30,981
[SPEAKER_08]: It really goes with the rest of the album.

1297
01:44:31,382 --> 01:44:35,485
[SPEAKER_08]: But I like that song in relation to the rest of it because it's very quirky.

1298
01:44:36,186 --> 01:44:38,147
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got... I don't know.

1299
01:44:38,167 --> 01:44:40,690
[SPEAKER_08]: It just sounds very old school Madonna to me.

1300
01:44:40,710 --> 01:44:41,110
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1301
01:44:41,130 --> 01:44:44,993
[SPEAKER_05]: If you let me pick my song, it's going to be way quirkier.

1302
01:44:46,395 --> 01:44:46,755
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1303
01:44:46,775 --> 01:44:47,476
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think, Jamie?

1304
01:44:47,516 --> 01:44:48,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Should we let Brad put a song in?

1305
01:44:49,177 --> 01:44:50,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Or we just want to keep it at two?

1306
01:44:50,899 --> 01:44:51,739
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the song, Brad?

1307
01:44:51,759 --> 01:44:53,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Twelve.

1308
01:44:54,993 --> 01:44:55,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, fine.

1309
01:44:58,034 --> 01:45:04,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Since nobody's going to vote for that one, I guess we have to give Sandbone Trio a little competition.

1310
01:45:06,336 --> 01:45:06,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

1311
01:45:08,176 --> 01:45:10,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Jesus.

1312
01:45:10,937 --> 01:45:13,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, what's the song that you're putting in?

1313
01:45:13,057 --> 01:45:13,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this an audio CD?

1314
01:45:14,078 --> 01:45:16,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's audio, so pull up the trackers.

1315
01:45:16,138 --> 01:45:17,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to see the trackers first.

1316
01:45:17,278 --> 01:45:17,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1317
01:45:29,108 --> 01:45:29,568
[SPEAKER_05]: We're rolling...

1318
01:45:56,943 --> 01:45:58,028
[SPEAKER_25]: This is the good one.

1319
01:45:58,229 --> 01:45:59,013
[SPEAKER_25]: Take five.

1320
01:46:22,403 --> 01:46:23,184
DarkSakura.com

1321
01:47:17,677 --> 01:47:19,860
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

1322
01:47:52,660 --> 01:47:53,441
Thank you for watching!

1323
01:48:51,616 --> 01:48:55,563
I'm a chicken machine I'm a chicken machine

1324
01:49:20,823 --> 01:49:23,386
That was the Aquabats with Magic Chicken.

1325
01:49:23,406 --> 01:49:25,628
Jamie, what did you think of that?

1326
01:49:25,708 --> 01:49:26,229
I like Skaf.

1327
01:49:45,917 --> 01:49:48,197
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think that that would work as a cage match song.

1328
01:49:48,798 --> 01:49:50,278
[SPEAKER_13]: As a song, it gets a 9.

1329
01:49:50,918 --> 01:49:52,698
[SPEAKER_13]: As a cage match pick, it gets a 4.

1330
01:49:52,758 --> 01:49:54,979
[SPEAKER_13]: Brad!

1331
01:49:56,199 --> 01:49:57,019
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to agree.

1332
01:49:57,439 --> 01:49:59,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't trying to make it compete with anything.

1333
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:01,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the song.

1334
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:03,380
[SPEAKER_05]: As a song, it gets a 10.

1335
01:50:03,580 --> 01:50:06,261
[SPEAKER_05]: As a cage match, it gets a crap.

1336
01:50:06,921 --> 01:50:09,461
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wasn't trying, you know, that was just kind of a fucked up thing.

1337
01:50:09,681 --> 01:50:12,202
[SPEAKER_05]: But before we go on to you, I want to ask something.

1338
01:50:12,802 --> 01:50:13,022
[SPEAKER_05]: What...

1339
01:50:14,034 --> 01:50:15,155
[SPEAKER_05]: is a Cage Match song.

1340
01:50:15,235 --> 01:50:18,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Is Cage Match just Beat Mania style stuff?

1341
01:50:18,918 --> 01:50:21,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Trance, techno, dancey stuff?

1342
01:50:21,359 --> 01:50:24,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Songs that you'd want to hear regularly on Orange Moms Radio.

1343
01:50:24,361 --> 01:50:27,163
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what Cage... Okay, see, I had it all wrong.

1344
01:50:28,424 --> 01:50:32,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Next time I'll make sure to get something good that you want to hear, like Eminem or something.

1345
01:50:32,647 --> 01:50:33,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Slick motherfuckers.

1346
01:50:34,669 --> 01:50:36,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I'm kidding.

1347
01:50:37,371 --> 01:50:39,032
[SPEAKER_09]: As for my opinions on the song...

1348
01:50:40,258 --> 01:50:41,659
[SPEAKER_09]: 11.

1349
01:50:40,538 --> 01:50:41,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Best cage match pick ever.

1350
01:50:44,920 --> 01:50:49,662
[SPEAKER_08]: No, my favorite part of that song is when he's ratting off the different chicken places.

1351
01:50:49,922 --> 01:50:50,642
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not bad.

1352
01:50:51,903 --> 01:50:52,703
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1353
01:50:52,843 --> 01:50:53,944
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very Guitar Freaks.

1354
01:50:54,004 --> 01:50:55,044
[SPEAKER_08]: I can see it in Guitar Freaks.

1355
01:50:55,084 --> 01:50:56,525
[SPEAKER_13]: Totally.

1356
01:50:56,545 --> 01:50:58,326
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, whatever.

1357
01:50:58,666 --> 01:50:59,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

1358
01:50:59,166 --> 01:50:59,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Seven.

1359
01:50:59,506 --> 01:50:59,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

1360
01:51:00,386 --> 01:51:01,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so.

1361
01:51:02,047 --> 01:51:05,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Your entries, your possible votes, and send those votes to Sky in the chat room right now.

1362
01:51:05,869 --> 01:51:08,690
[SPEAKER_08]: You can vote for the Sandbone Trio with Born to be Bone.

1363
01:51:10,333 --> 01:51:12,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is off a CD that's not in it.

1364
01:51:13,034 --> 01:51:14,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, you don't get clips of the songs tonight.

1365
01:51:14,955 --> 01:51:16,695
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't remember them, you suck.

1366
01:51:17,095 --> 01:51:23,238
[SPEAKER_08]: So you get Born to be Boned from the Sandbone Trio, The Aquabats with Magic Chicken, or Madonna with Mother and Father.

1367
01:51:24,718 --> 01:51:25,819
[SPEAKER_14]: And not Duck Toy.

1368
01:51:26,059 --> 01:51:26,839
[SPEAKER_08]: And not Duck Toy.

1369
01:51:26,879 --> 01:51:28,419
[SPEAKER_08]: If you vote for Duck Toy, you get kicked.

1370
01:51:30,831 --> 01:51:34,773
[SPEAKER_08]: So, send me your votes in the chatroom right now of a private message to Sky.

1371
01:51:35,234 --> 01:51:37,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless it's Sunday, because we're pre-taped this week.

1372
01:51:38,095 --> 01:51:42,658
[SPEAKER_08]: So, if you know the super secret time that we're taping, send them right now.

1373
01:51:44,119 --> 01:51:49,341
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're in the chatroom right now, I actually want to hold off just really fast.

1374
01:51:49,402 --> 01:51:53,324
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to get one more news story out in the open before we go to a break.

1375
01:51:53,844 --> 01:51:54,885
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob has a confession.

1376
01:51:55,305 --> 01:51:56,445
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a confession to make.

1377
01:51:56,926 --> 01:51:56,946
[SPEAKER_08]: I...

1378
01:51:58,249 --> 01:52:00,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Am Homo Sapien.

1379
01:52:00,230 --> 01:52:00,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1380
01:52:02,291 --> 01:52:08,673
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you guys have heard about this yet, but have you ever been to those sites, Petition Online, like where you can sign petitions?

1381
01:52:08,773 --> 01:52:10,153
[SPEAKER_13]: And no one really gives a fuck about them?

1382
01:52:10,334 --> 01:52:11,274
[SPEAKER_08]: No one really cares?

1383
01:52:11,574 --> 01:52:15,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Like they had a petition to save Frenchie on American Idol that got like 500,000 signatures?

1384
01:52:16,276 --> 01:52:16,896
[SPEAKER_08]: It didn't do shit.

1385
01:52:17,552 --> 01:52:22,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, somebody decided, well, maybe we can get petitions to work for once.

1386
01:52:22,374 --> 01:52:27,755
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to petition for Konami of Japan to release a new version of Beatmania 2DX to the consumer.

1387
01:52:28,056 --> 01:52:29,736
[SPEAKER_08]: However, there's a catch to this petition.

1388
01:52:31,017 --> 01:52:31,717
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll read this.

1389
01:52:32,377 --> 01:52:38,259
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a petition asking Konami for a new release of Beatmania 2DX, preferably 7th style, for the Japanese PlayStation 2 console.

1390
01:52:38,599 --> 01:52:44,041
[SPEAKER_08]: For all fans who are looking forward to a new mix, please sign this petition as it will be sent directly to Konami of Japan.

1391
01:52:44,421 --> 01:52:46,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Either KCEJ or Konami Toyo.

1392
01:52:47,870 --> 01:52:53,512
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not a solo project and is part of a larger petition with major Japanese Bimani fansite.

1393
01:52:54,072 --> 01:52:59,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Any comments you add will be translated into Japanese and sent along with your name to Konami.

1394
01:52:59,453 --> 01:53:00,254
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of the catch.

1395
01:53:01,854 --> 01:53:03,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for supporting this petition.

1396
01:53:03,855 --> 01:53:14,097
[SPEAKER_08]: So, if you want to go sign this petition, I'll post the link in the chat room right now, and hopefully somebody will be kind enough to repaste it at this point in the show on Sunday when it rebroadcasts.

1397
01:53:14,458 --> 01:53:15,718
[SPEAKER_08]: But the website for this petition...

1398
01:53:17,034 --> 01:53:25,782
[SPEAKER_08]: is petitiononline.com slash new2dx, but that's the number 2, not ii, as you usually see it.

1399
01:53:26,102 --> 01:53:31,387
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's petitiononline.com slash new2dx.

1400
01:53:32,608 --> 01:53:37,091
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can go sign that petition, and right now, there's quite a few.

1401
01:53:37,131 --> 01:53:40,034
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got 98 signatures on it so far, so not too bad.

1402
01:53:40,915 --> 01:53:42,056
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can go sign that right now.

1403
01:53:42,116 --> 01:53:43,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe you'll be lucky 100.

1404
01:53:43,557 --> 01:53:44,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Quick, get in there right now.

1405
01:53:45,234 --> 01:53:49,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so that's what you can sign if you want to petition for 7th style.

1406
01:53:49,237 --> 01:53:50,277
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think of that, Jamie?

1407
01:53:50,998 --> 01:53:51,458
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll sign it.

1408
01:53:52,259 --> 01:53:53,019
[SPEAKER_08]: What can it hurt, right?

1409
01:53:55,180 --> 01:53:57,122
[SPEAKER_14]: This will be five whole seconds of my life.

1410
01:53:57,182 --> 01:53:57,962
[SPEAKER_14]: I can never get back.

1411
01:53:59,003 --> 01:54:02,265
[SPEAKER_08]: So after the break, we're going to come back and... Yes, for 7th style.

1412
01:54:02,585 --> 01:54:07,909
[SPEAKER_08]: After the break, we're going to come back and we're going to announce the cage match winner.

1413
01:54:08,589 --> 01:54:09,910
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to club baby seals.

1414
01:54:10,310 --> 01:54:12,211
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to have hot monkey sex.

1415
01:54:12,512 --> 01:54:13,832
[SPEAKER_14]: No, you can have hot monkey sex.

1416
01:54:13,893 --> 01:54:14,313
[SPEAKER_08]: And then...

1417
01:54:15,703 --> 01:54:21,985
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you'll wake up on an island with these shiny new necklaces.

1418
01:54:22,606 --> 01:54:23,426
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll break something.

1419
01:54:23,446 --> 01:54:24,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes I like to kick people in the nuts.

1420
01:54:25,267 --> 01:54:27,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I know one.

1421
01:54:27,447 --> 01:54:28,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Pull up my DeviantArt page.

1422
01:54:46,175 --> 01:54:49,456
[SPEAKER_13]: I have clips on my DeviantArt page.

1423
01:54:49,476 --> 01:54:51,897
[SPEAKER_08]: By the time I pull up your DeviantArt page, I'll have the music ready.

1424
01:54:52,157 --> 01:54:52,817
[SPEAKER_13]: Bullshit.

1425
01:54:53,517 --> 01:54:55,038
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1426
01:54:56,538 --> 01:54:57,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we're going to take a quick break.

1427
01:54:57,959 --> 01:55:03,761
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to play some more old school Beatmania stuff because, you know, it was so popular last time.

1428
01:55:04,181 --> 01:55:07,482
[SPEAKER_08]: And since we're not going to have monkey sex, we'll start with Drunk Monkey instead.

1429
01:55:08,022 --> 01:55:08,543
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back.

1430
01:55:08,703 --> 01:55:09,703
[SPEAKER_08]: You're listening to Orange Launch Radio.

1431
01:56:34,757 --> 01:56:36,022
Thanks for watching!

1432
01:58:23,109 --> 01:58:24,970
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for watching!

1433
01:58:45,051 --> 01:58:46,272
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't you love me?

1434
01:58:46,292 --> 01:58:47,452
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't you love me?

1435
01:58:47,472 --> 01:58:49,293
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't you love me?

1436
01:58:49,313 --> 01:58:50,974
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't you love me?

1437
01:58:50,994 --> 01:58:53,296
[SPEAKER_20]: You're the city How can I win your heart?

1438
01:59:14,233 --> 01:59:22,899
[SPEAKER_20]: In a moment of love, nothing will calm me down Did you really love me?

1439
01:59:22,919 --> 01:59:39,511
[SPEAKER_20]: Daddy, hold me tight No more willow wings, I've got to make my move You were a dreamy romp, if you knew how I feel Baby, can't you see, to make you mine

1440
01:59:54,639 --> 01:59:59,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen to Orange Lounge Radio Because Bongo demands it

1441
02:00:17,603 --> 02:00:19,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so that's tonight's Big Cage Match winner.

1442
02:00:19,504 --> 02:00:22,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we have an extra special treat for this evening.

1443
02:00:22,766 --> 02:00:26,788
[SPEAKER_08]: As you may or may not know, sometimes on this station when we're bored, we'll do a fuck-off show.

1444
02:00:27,269 --> 02:00:30,851
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Jamie did one of these the other night, last night, right?

1445
02:00:31,171 --> 02:00:34,353
[SPEAKER_13]: Usually it's just me putting in a random comment and then playing five hours of music.

1446
02:00:34,893 --> 02:00:40,719
[SPEAKER_08]: And since we don't have a whole lot else to talk about tonight, we thought we'd treat you with an hour clip of one of these fuck-off shows.

1447
02:00:40,739 --> 02:00:41,940
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was fun, wasn't it, Jamie?

1448
02:00:42,020 --> 02:00:44,822
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, the theme of my fuck-off last night was stupid laws.

1449
02:00:45,323 --> 02:00:46,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Stupid laws.

1450
02:00:46,584 --> 02:00:51,708
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's going to take you out the last hour of tonight's show, and then it's all done, you guys.

1451
02:00:51,809 --> 02:00:54,531
[SPEAKER_13]: But before that, so that I can let you hear it.

1452
02:00:54,831 --> 02:00:58,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we're going to do the outro of the show first and then go into that.

1453
02:00:58,935 --> 02:00:59,676
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll not do the outro.

1454
02:00:59,696 --> 02:01:00,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't worry about that.

1455
02:01:00,276 --> 02:01:02,118
[SPEAKER_13]: Just do the fortune cookie.

1456
02:01:02,138 --> 02:01:04,641
[SPEAKER_13]: I have something else funny that we can use as a normal fortune cookie.

1457
02:01:05,521 --> 02:01:05,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1458
02:01:05,882 --> 02:01:07,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead and join in.

1459
02:01:07,523 --> 02:01:08,184
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to hear this.

1460
02:01:08,224 --> 02:01:08,784
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is it.

1461
02:01:08,824 --> 02:01:10,966
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the normal fortune cookie for tonight.

1462
02:01:11,007 --> 02:01:11,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

1463
02:01:14,238 --> 02:01:15,579
[SPEAKER_27]: Car theft is on the rocks.

1464
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,963
[SPEAKER_27]: In America, a car is stolen every 12 seconds.

1465
02:01:19,563 --> 02:01:21,025
[SPEAKER_27]: What can you do to protect your car?

1466
02:01:21,645 --> 02:01:25,229
[SPEAKER_27]: An expensive car alarm system won't protect your car from being stolen.

1467
02:01:25,790 --> 02:01:28,432
[SPEAKER_27]: The club won't protect the valuables inside your car.

1468
02:01:29,013 --> 02:01:31,355
[SPEAKER_27]: But a big black guy named Ben can.

1469
02:01:31,575 --> 02:01:33,577
[SPEAKER_27]: Get away from the car, motherfucker.

1470
02:01:34,298 --> 02:01:37,361
[SPEAKER_27]: For less than you'd pay for an expensive car alarm system, and even

1471
02:01:39,248 --> 02:01:42,971
[SPEAKER_27]: You can get a big black guy named Ben to protect your automobile.

1472
02:01:43,191 --> 02:01:45,193
[SPEAKER_27]: Get away from the car, motherf***er.

1473
02:01:46,053 --> 02:01:46,974
[SPEAKER_27]: It's simple to use.

1474
02:01:47,374 --> 02:01:52,358
[SPEAKER_27]: Just leave the big black guy named Ben in your car whenever you get out, and he does the rest.

1475
02:01:52,739 --> 02:01:59,324
[SPEAKER_27]: Whenever anyone gets within six feet of your car, Ben simply gets out of the car and tells them... Get away from the car, motherf***er.

1476
02:02:00,086 --> 02:02:04,449
[SPEAKER_27]: Listen to these testimonials from people who use a big black guy named Ben.

1477
02:02:04,610 --> 02:02:10,914
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always nice to have someone to ride with, although he really doesn't say much, just... Get away from the car, motherfucker.

1478
02:02:12,435 --> 02:02:13,096
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about it.

1479
02:02:13,776 --> 02:02:16,098
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get a big black guy named Ben to chat with.

1480
02:02:16,418 --> 02:02:17,900
[SPEAKER_00]: I got him to protect my car.

1481
02:02:18,220 --> 02:02:20,281
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best investment I've ever made.

1482
02:02:21,262 --> 02:02:22,323
[SPEAKER_25]: My neighborhood isn't that great.

1483
02:02:22,918 --> 02:02:24,359
[SPEAKER_25]: There have been a lot of car thefts.

1484
02:02:24,599 --> 02:02:28,582
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't tell you how many times I've heard... Get away from the car, motherfucker!

1485
02:02:28,982 --> 02:02:33,285
[SPEAKER_25]: Knowing that I've got a big black guy named Ben protecting my car lets me sleep better at night.

1486
02:02:33,626 --> 02:02:36,227
[SPEAKER_27]: Call now, 1-800-1-BIG-GUY.

1487
02:02:36,468 --> 02:02:39,650
[SPEAKER_27]: That's 1-800-1-B-I-G-G-U-Y.

1488
02:02:40,050 --> 02:02:44,773
[SPEAKER_27]: And instead of hearing this... You'll hear this.

1489
02:02:45,094 --> 02:02:47,075
[SPEAKER_27]: Get away from the car, motherfucker!

1490
02:02:49,136 --> 02:02:49,156
[SPEAKER_20]: D...

1491
02:02:50,529 --> 02:02:52,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so, that's it.

1492
