Just kidding, orange lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

00:35.660 --> 00:42.660
this episode.

01:05.660 --> 01:08.660
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

01:08.660 --> 01:10.660
Why did they have to take the word gay?

01:11.660 --> 01:15.660
No! What I expect for Spanish acquisition is gay.

01:15.660 --> 01:18.660
Hey, hey!

01:18.660 --> 01:19.660
Dark Sakura.

01:19.660 --> 01:23.660
Shut up! Where's my gun? This is my boomstick.

01:23.660 --> 01:24.660
Sky.

01:24.660 --> 01:26.660
Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb.

01:26.660 --> 01:27.660
Loki.

01:27.660 --> 01:30.660
I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.

01:30.660 --> 01:33.660
What kind of war human being would find that funny?

01:33.660 --> 01:37.700
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:37.700 --> 01:43.340
We are live, and this is episode number 40 for April the 13th of 2003.

You're tuned into the B-Money scene's most interesting radio station of all things B-Money!

01:52.840 --> 01:55.340

Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner of the Happiest Bunny on the

01:58.660 --> 01:59.940

our tech mass on loki

02:10.440 --> 02:13.780

02:13.780 --> 02:17.900
and uh... also with us tonight will be turning down rob's channel a lot

02:17.900 --> 02:19.240

02:19.240 --> 02:22.800

02:22.800 --> 02:24.240
this is great because you can see

02:24.240 --> 02:29.240
with this new mixing board you can still hear me

02:29.240 --> 02:41.240
The show is over the hill now.

02:41.240 --> 02:44.800
I know! We're turning 40 tonight! We're over the hill!

02:44.800 --> 02:47.480
You're like magical and stuff.

02:47.480 --> 02:49.720
Does this mean we're going to have a mid-show crisis?

02:49.720 --> 02:53.200
We just went after last week's breakdown mid-show.

02:53.200 --> 02:58.000
Oh my god! I feel old! I need to go to the first gate!

02:58.000 --> 03:02.640
Remember how we almost like had a big crisis mid-show last week? Like a giant fight?

03:02.640 --> 03:05.720
Starting with zero? It was so neat.

03:05.720 --> 03:09.460
No, that was just going off on a stupid song. But see, I am

03:09.460 --> 03:16.460
the mid-show crisis. Have a good day.

03:39.460 --> 03:43.460
Ooh, we'll have to hear more about that when we come back from the first break.

03:43.460 --> 03:45.460
Sounds like we have a lot to be thankful for this week.

03:45.460 --> 03:48.460
I'm going to have to get rid of the FUs and do a happy segment.

03:48.460 --> 03:49.460
Fuck that!

03:49.460 --> 03:50.460
Okay, fuck that.

03:50.460 --> 03:53.460
I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.

03:53.460 --> 03:56.460
Lots of people saying hello to Zero in the chat room,

03:56.460 --> 04:00.460
including Angel and the other folks here.

04:00.460 --> 04:04.460
However, if you want to get in our chat room and say hello, it's easy.

04:04.460 --> 04:11.460
It's easy, just go to www.calibomani.com, our friends over there, and click on Orange Lounge and click on Chat.

04:11.460 --> 04:13.460
It's just not supposed to be.

04:13.460 --> 04:16.460
Alright, we're gonna start off this break with what, Jamie?

04:16.460 --> 04:17.460
Crap!

04:17.460 --> 04:19.460
This isn't crap, I like this song.

04:19.460 --> 04:21.460
We're gonna start off with old shit.

04:21.460 --> 04:27.460
Old shit, okay, so we're gonna hear some old Bomani music, and we'll be back to talk about a lot of stuff.

04:27.460 --> 04:32.460
There's a lot, a lot, a lot of stuff to talk about this week, and by the way, tonight, you guys, get your friends on the station,

04:32.460 --> 04:39.460
tonight we have Kyle Snyder's new single live from March Madness. I'm moist with anticipation.

04:39.460 --> 04:45.460
It's a miracle I actually convinced him to sing it a second time, because he kept getting

04:45.460 --> 04:47.460
getting interrupted, he's like, I'm not gonna do it anymore.

05:15.460 --> 05:23.460
Smoke it out, when nobody wants to beat anyone, and nobody's backing me

05:23.460 --> 05:29.460
I wanna be with the creatures of frames, I'll stand by the lights, watch the rain fall and say

05:29.460 --> 05:33.460
Grab what you can, we'll head for the wild past three

05:33.460 --> 05:43.460
La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La

05:43.460 --> 05:50.260
Now

06:43.460 --> 06:45.460
Oh

07:43.460 --> 07:50.460
When the time has still come, I'm gonna call your name

07:50.460 --> 07:53.460
I don't want to die, you won't get it

07:53.460 --> 07:56.460
Stay with me, Saturday, ladies

07:56.460 --> 08:00.460
Stay close to me, cause I wanna see

08:00.460 --> 08:03.460
Wanna see the color of the blue eyes, baby

08:03.460 --> 08:06.460
This is the night, when you see the light

08:06.460 --> 08:09.460
Of the fire burning in my heart for your big love

09:09.460 --> 09:11.460
You get it, get it, daddy

09:11.460 --> 09:13.460
Come on, come on

09:13.460 --> 09:17.460
Yeah, Mr. Raps from the M.I.C.

09:17.460 --> 09:22.460
This song get it, get it, all the young busy messin' up, you know

09:22.460 --> 09:25.460
But you are getting so young, that goes in busy

09:25.460 --> 09:28.460
Scared heart attack, a lot of woman talk, a easy die

09:28.460 --> 09:30.460
Took guy to E-Wake, a girl, straight like law

09:30.460 --> 09:32.460
You are a loss of law

09:32.460 --> 09:34.460
Dance with my mom and my money

09:34.460 --> 09:35.460
Not good standing, money

09:35.460 --> 09:37.460
My money, not a man, no man, make money, money

09:37.460 --> 09:39.460
I can't wait to see you again

09:39.460 --> 09:45.460
I'm gonna do this to you

09:45.460 --> 09:48.460
It's like you want, can't do it

09:48.460 --> 09:50.460
You are the one who did everything

09:50.460 --> 09:52.460
You're gonna be alright

09:52.460 --> 09:55.460
I want to make you who you wanna be

09:55.460 --> 09:57.460
Can't fake it now

09:57.460 --> 09:59.460
I can't wait to go out

09:59.460 --> 10:02.460
Just play with you with me all night

10:02.460 --> 10:06.460
Yeah, everyday, everywhere

10:36.460 --> 10:39.460
Come on, come on, make it so I can stay.

10:39.460 --> 10:41.460
This is what, this is what.

10:41.460 --> 10:43.460
I've been forced to pay, but who won?

10:43.460 --> 10:45.460
You can't stay.

10:45.460 --> 10:48.460
Now, I just can't, make it so I can stay.

10:48.460 --> 10:51.460
This is what, this is what.

10:54.460 --> 10:56.460
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here,

10:56.460 --> 10:59.460
informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

10:59.460 --> 11:04.460
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

11:04.460 --> 11:10.460
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

11:34.460 --> 11:42.460
Okay, Japan Man wants to know where in the hell he can get his hands on that new slagwork remix you did that we debuted last week.

11:42.460 --> 11:47.460
Um, nowhere right now. I'll put it up later.

11:47.460 --> 11:48.460
Well, where's it going to be?

11:48.460 --> 11:49.460
It's going to be on my site.

11:49.460 --> 11:51.460
Where is your site, for those that don't know?

11:51.460 --> 11:57.460
It's going to be www.willddrforfood.net slash leech from Loki.

11:57.460 --> 12:03.460
Beautiful. So that's where you can download this new slagwork single. Whenever Loki gets off his butt and puts it up.

12:03.460 --> 12:17.160
it up. Yeah. Or you can get it from Dark Sakura because she's got it too. You can beg

12:17.160 --> 12:20.840
one of us in chat and we'll give it to you. Just not during the show because we're trying

12:20.840 --> 12:25.360
to do the show. You have to offer me favors. You have to buy me that hot rod toy. Oh, I

12:25.360 --> 12:30.180
can do this later. Keep going for it, I don't care. You know what, we totally neglected

12:30.180 --> 12:33.480
the sim update last week, so let's just start tonight with the sim update, shall we?

12:33.480 --> 12:38.940
Well, I got ahold of this guy who goes, what the hell is that? Oh, he got food. Not for

12:38.940 --> 12:43.940
me though. Anyways, this guy is shoey. He's just done a bunch of stuff. He's, right now,

12:43.940 --> 12:48.620
what he's been doing is like the DDR Game Boy stuff. He has all the sim files for all

12:48.620 --> 12:54.900
the DDR Game Boy tracks. So, we've got those. But, we're going to swap our collections.

12:54.900 --> 12:59.740
And this guy's got 4,000. And I have 2,000.

12:59.740 --> 13:03.100
well but uh... he has like one of everything he he he

13:03.100 --> 13:04.240
collects like

13:04.240 --> 13:06.560
everything up the site so

13:06.560 --> 13:10.260
you know whereas i might have like one good one for uh... you know

13:10.260 --> 13:13.160
slide work whatever you'll have everything one ever made first light

13:13.160 --> 13:14.360
work with

13:14.360 --> 13:15.960
obviously i don't want to do but

13:15.960 --> 13:19.400
it's cool you know so we're gonna be trading those and that's awesome and i

13:19.400 --> 13:20.680
can't wait to do that

13:20.680 --> 13:22.300
and then uh...

13:22.300 --> 13:25.080
i finally got up all my uh...

13:25.080 --> 13:26.440
uh... job uh...

13:26.440 --> 13:30.360
downloading scripts so that's all up so you can actually get files now pretty

13:30.360 --> 13:32.260
easy just going through the site

13:32.260 --> 13:35.920
and then uh... i'm hopefully trying to do some more updates but it's been kinda hard

13:35.920 --> 13:38.940
because i've been getting ready to pack and stuff and

13:38.940 --> 13:42.680
you're not really been concentrating on doing a site right now so

13:42.680 --> 13:46.640
i don't know uh... right now i'm averaging about one update a month so that's about

13:46.640 --> 13:48.400
you know what we're gonna have been

13:48.400 --> 13:50.880
aside from all that uh...

13:50.880 --> 13:52.240
let's see

13:52.240 --> 13:55.360
definitely check out bamani symptoms because you can always get you know new

13:55.360 --> 13:59.580
files there even though some of them are like rehash old shit but you know a lot

13:59.580 --> 14:04.240
of new stuff especially uh utter dude and he he does some really awesome sim

14:04.240 --> 14:08.400
files he's like my number one now only because healing vision doesn't do him

14:08.400 --> 14:12.840
fast enough but he'd be he'd be net my number one if you know oh speaking of

14:12.840 --> 14:19.320
healing vision I'm gonna have he's my first sim file creator interview II and

14:19.320 --> 14:23.560
so I've got that coming up along with all of his files so that'll be later on

14:23.560 --> 14:36.560
And then, I don't know, just not too much going on. There's, you know, what was it, Havok got a hold of the EuroMix 2 disc, so he's ripping the banners and stuff from that. So hopefully we'll have some clean banners for that.

14:36.560 --> 14:52.560
And then, oh, just a bunch of minor stuff. Not really anything new with stepping in, no new releases or anything. Yeah, Zero's files are back up on BimaniSims and, oh, that's pretty much it, you know, not too much.

14:52.560 --> 14:59.240
All right.

14:59.240 --> 15:03.240
So happy 40th birthday everybody.

15:03.240 --> 15:04.600
We are 40 weeks old.

15:04.600 --> 15:08.760
Actually we're older than that because we did two pre-taped shows and a pre-empted week

15:08.760 --> 15:11.200
so we're actually somewhere around 43 or 44 years old.

15:11.200 --> 15:16.200
But it's the 40th actual show you guys.

15:16.200 --> 15:19.840
Favorite memory from the past 40 episodes.

15:19.840 --> 15:20.840
What do you think?

15:20.840 --> 15:22.080
Favorite memory from the past 40 episodes?

15:22.080 --> 15:26.680
Out of every single show we've done, what was the funniest or best memory that we did?

15:26.680 --> 15:28.080
My debut.

15:28.080 --> 15:30.400
Which was, do you remember what number that was?

15:30.400 --> 15:31.400
32.

15:31.400 --> 15:36.240
I don't remember shit.

15:36.240 --> 15:38.160
You remember, Loki?

15:38.160 --> 15:39.160
I'm thinking.

15:39.160 --> 15:40.160
This should be a list list some week.

15:40.160 --> 15:41.160
We'll do that for 50.

15:41.160 --> 15:46.440
I'm thinking because I want to say there was one that I had you guys laughing really hard.

15:46.440 --> 15:48.320
I can't remember what it was.

15:48.320 --> 15:50.480
It was one of the FUs of the week.

15:50.480 --> 15:54.560
I just can't remember.

15:54.560 --> 15:57.440
Anytime I have food, because I'm hungry and I'm broke at

15:57.440 --> 16:00.240
the moment, I haven't taken any money out from the bank.

16:00.240 --> 16:04.520
So I need food, but.

16:04.520 --> 16:10.000
I would say episode, probably, either episode number eight,

16:10.000 --> 16:11.720
which was the one, it was a really early episode.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.040
We had DDR Mike and Jazz here.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.720
I remember that, because that's when we had got into the

16:14.720 --> 16:16.760
whole discussion about pantsless rage and

16:16.760 --> 16:18.040
three-titted Emmy.

16:18.040 --> 16:19.040
That's a classic.

16:19.040 --> 16:22.940
and uh... episode i think it was twenty seven that was the one when angel and

16:22.940 --> 16:25.200
stress that there were those are first visit town

16:25.200 --> 16:26.200
that was the night

16:26.200 --> 16:28.540
when i realized that orange long to take it over this house

16:28.540 --> 16:31.340
because we're so damn many people here that night you remember that

16:31.340 --> 16:33.500
it's crazy

16:33.500 --> 16:35.620
and i quit myself

16:35.620 --> 16:38.420
i don't know shit

16:38.420 --> 16:43.420
some folks in the chat room say their favorite memory is all the poor talk

16:43.420 --> 16:46.760
uh... i like when i had balls

16:46.760 --> 16:47.720
What was that?

16:47.720 --> 16:51.420
I don't know. It was the first time Jonas showed up.

16:51.420 --> 16:54.560
Yeah, where's our balls? Jonas is supposed to bring some for us. We're still missing them.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.300
You having trouble fighting your balls?

16:56.300 --> 16:59.440
Yeah, because I paid him two dollars to go get them.

16:59.440 --> 17:06.440
I hope he remembers to get food for me. Sending brainwaves, brainwaves, brainwaves, brainwaves.

17:08.560 --> 17:11.060
Where's what? Video recorder?

17:11.060 --> 17:14.320
Is that it on the ground? Okay. Actually, no. Jonas left stuff here.

17:14.320 --> 17:18.320
My favorite thing was March Madness when I just went off.

17:18.320 --> 17:22.320
I think it was so funny because I pissed people off. I don't know why.

17:22.320 --> 17:29.320
Well, then I guess we could say my favorite thing was slowly becoming insane during Shaft.

17:29.320 --> 17:31.320
Oh, yeah. That was classic.

17:31.320 --> 17:38.320
I'm sick and I don't care. I want you to die. I'm hungry. Ooh, food.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.320
Yes. I like that.

17:40.320 --> 17:50.320
To avoid our coverage of Shaft and March Madness, we have B3 coming up, which B3 is the weekend of the 17th, I want to say.

17:50.320 --> 17:53.320
God, I hope I'm not wrong. I'm not looking at a calendar, so forgive me if I messed up.

17:53.320 --> 17:54.320
17th?

17:54.320 --> 17:56.320
Isn't that right? Of May?

17:56.320 --> 17:58.320
I hope not.

17:58.320 --> 17:59.320
Why? What's that?

17:59.320 --> 18:00.320
Because of E3?

18:00.320 --> 18:02.320
Yeah, it's like right after E3. It's right after E3.

18:02.320 --> 18:04.320
Is E3 the week before?

18:04.320 --> 18:09.320
No, E3 is like Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and B3 is Saturday, Sunday.

18:09.320 --> 18:13.320
Shit, I hope... God damn it, I'm gonna miss Matrix!

18:13.320 --> 18:17.320
No! Can't have this!

18:17.320 --> 18:21.320
We're trying to see who we have to blow to get B3 tickets, by the way.

18:21.320 --> 18:25.320
E3. I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry, yeah. We don't have to worry about B3 tickets.

18:25.320 --> 18:29.320
But if somebody there needs blown, whatever.

18:29.320 --> 18:33.320
I'm sure people would mind getting blown for free.

18:33.320 --> 18:37.320
We're trying to get tickets to E3 really, really badly.

18:37.320 --> 18:42.000
Don't put that up in my mouth!

18:42.000 --> 18:43.240
I was trying to make you practice.

18:43.240 --> 18:46.640
Rob's trying to shove the microphone up my nose.

18:46.640 --> 18:49.640
I don't have to really say anything because this thing picks up everything.

18:49.640 --> 18:55.320
I'm holding the microphone across the room, and it's blinking.

18:55.320 --> 18:56.320
Missy?

18:56.320 --> 19:00.280
Rob's taking volunteers of people he can practice blowing.

19:00.280 --> 19:01.280
No!

19:01.280 --> 19:02.280
For E3.

19:02.280 --> 19:03.280
No!

19:03.280 --> 19:04.280
Not me.

19:04.280 --> 19:09.280
Not me. That's why we have an intern.

19:09.280 --> 19:14.280
Fuck you all.

19:14.280 --> 19:20.280
I suppose we can talk about actual Bemani news tonight.

19:20.280 --> 19:26.280
Alright, this is the one that's on everybody's mind and you know we have to bring this up, you guys.

19:26.280 --> 19:29.280
The big, big news that comes out this week.

19:29.280 --> 19:36.640
Electronics Boutique on their website is now taking pre-orders for Dance Dance Revolution

19:36.640 --> 19:37.640
Xbox Mix.

19:37.640 --> 19:44.720
This is Xbox, because you can't have an Xbox Mix, because that just sounds stupid.

19:44.720 --> 19:47.720
What do you think of this DDR Xbox Mix?

19:47.720 --> 19:52.400
Well, considering that it looks like it has characters again, obviously, so I'm wondering

19:52.400 --> 19:58.120
if they're going to try to port the DDR PC version over to the Xbox, which I would like.

19:58.120 --> 20:02.820
I'll read this story. This is the official story coming from GamingHorizon.com.

20:02.820 --> 20:06.640
It was only a matter of time until we saw the popular Dance Dance Revolution franchise

20:06.640 --> 20:09.560
scatter onto other consoles besides the PlayStation.

20:09.560 --> 20:11.700
DDR first started in the arcades.

20:11.700 --> 20:16.040
Electronic Boutique's website informs visitors of an upcoming DDR game from Konami entitled

20:16.040 --> 20:18.760
Dance Dance Revolution Xbox.

20:18.760 --> 20:23.800
The game is supposedly going to contain all new songs, exclusive tracks for North America,

20:23.800 --> 20:30.800
Xbox Live integrations so gamers can download more songs, characters, and dance steps.

20:32.280 --> 20:36.840
New game modes are also going to be implemented in that have never been seen before in other

20:36.840 --> 20:41.420
DDR titles. Unfortunately, Economy of America hasn't sent out an official press release

20:41.420 --> 20:45.800
yet concerning this recent news, but we can almost guarantee to see something during E3

20:45.800 --> 20:46.320
in May.

20:46.320 --> 20:48.420
Will we get stuck with another diet mode?

20:48.420 --> 20:54.200
i think that this is it has as much a validity to it as uh... to yes you say

20:54.200 --> 20:55.720
i don't know it's got picture

20:55.720 --> 20:58.080
i can't i mean pictures are true great

20:58.080 --> 20:59.000
they know is ever

20:59.000 --> 21:01.520
take the picture of

21:01.520 --> 21:04.200
i'm gonna dissent i think it's true

21:04.200 --> 21:06.600
i i i really think this is true

21:06.600 --> 21:10.260
because i just don't i don't see electronics boutique having that big a

21:10.260 --> 21:11.800
balls

21:11.800 --> 21:16.280
did you call me

21:16.280 --> 21:18.140
you want to know what i think is absolutely stupid

21:18.140 --> 21:23.420
DDRX or something, and so they call it Xbox.

21:23.420 --> 21:24.340
As if it couldn't...

21:24.340 --> 21:25.940
As if, where's the imagination there?

21:25.940 --> 21:29.260
It could be a working title. Because it's only for the Xbox!

21:29.260 --> 21:32.000
It's only for the Xbox!

21:32.000 --> 21:35.300
And if you look at the box art, and I just posted a link in our chatroom

21:35.300 --> 21:37.380
to this story,

21:37.380 --> 21:41.820
it says, only for Xbox. But this is probably that fake art, you know how

21:41.820 --> 21:44.540
sometimes the big gaming stores,

21:44.540 --> 21:49.100
GameStop, EB, and all those. They do like the fake box art when they're doing it taking pre-orders?

21:49.100 --> 21:51.300
I'm gonna go and draw

21:51.300 --> 21:55.500
just DDR, Xbox, and put it up on the site and say this is the official art.

21:55.500 --> 21:57.740
First of all,

21:57.740 --> 22:01.940
it's DDR on a non-PlayStation system.

22:01.940 --> 22:05.940
And I loved my Dreamcast ones, you know, they're great.

22:05.940 --> 22:07.660
We can't make edits and take them with you.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.580
And you can't use paint mode, I mean,

22:09.580 --> 22:11.140
you know, paint

22:11.140 --> 22:15.280
it was like the best thing about third mix

22:15.280 --> 22:16.840
i think it's

22:16.840 --> 22:20.400
a big pile of stinky dog poo

22:20.400 --> 22:24.280
i guess we won't find out for sure till E3 but i don't know um...

22:24.280 --> 22:25.000
i think

22:25.000 --> 22:28.040
i think there's validity to it i just

22:28.040 --> 22:29.600
it makes sense

22:29.600 --> 22:32.520
microsoft's really straggling right now to get something that's going to be

22:32.520 --> 22:35.060
successful for their system you get a really

22:35.060 --> 22:38.200
popular kind of growing thing like DDR and there's going to be those

22:38.200 --> 22:41.340
obsessive freaks that will buy an Xbox just for this mix.

22:41.340 --> 22:45.220
I won't. I won't either, but there will be obsessive freaks that will.

22:45.220 --> 22:51.500
Oh, I can't wait. I can't wait. I can't wait. Oh, wait. Oh, it sucks.

22:51.500 --> 22:56.160
The Xbox is all about having Steel Battalion. So as the one person in this room who actually

22:56.160 --> 22:59.700
owns an Xbox, Jamie, what games are worth playing on the Xbox?

22:59.700 --> 23:04.340
The game of throwing the Xbox at children. Just Already a Future.

23:04.340 --> 23:08.340
D.O.A. Beach Volleyball

23:08.340 --> 23:12.340
There's nothing funnier than watching men

23:12.340 --> 23:16.340
trying to accessorize a swimsuit

23:16.340 --> 23:20.340
Fuck that, we're just trying to figure out how to take it off

23:20.340 --> 23:24.340
D.O.A. 3 was good because I am a

23:24.340 --> 23:28.340
fighting game heart

23:28.340 --> 23:32.340
Fable, I'm looking forward to

23:32.340 --> 23:39.380
club knockoff? Fable is an RPG where you start off with him as a child and you run through

23:39.380 --> 23:45.140
this character's life and whatever decision that you make, like say you lose an eye, well

23:45.140 --> 23:50.180
after a while the people might start calling you Winky or if you lose an arm you'll be

23:50.180 --> 23:56.980
like Lefty or whatever. What if you are without arms and legs, what would they call you then?

23:56.980 --> 23:59.560
target

23:59.560 --> 24:04.160
but like um... they also have like if you you know kill um... like this whole

24:04.160 --> 24:06.540
family and leave like a child alive

24:06.540 --> 24:09.800
the child can make it their life's quest to kill you

24:09.800 --> 24:13.420
or they'll be afraid of you or you know things like that it's like whatever

24:13.420 --> 24:17.380
decision you make. So when your character goes and sexually molests other children and other families and then

24:17.380 --> 24:20.040
they'll have issues later on in life

24:20.040 --> 24:22.220
yes it would work that way

24:22.220 --> 24:24.520
okay just checking

24:24.520 --> 24:28.840
I don't know, I think it would be kind of neat, although I don't really like...

24:28.840 --> 24:34.620
It's sort of like the typical American-looking art for RPGs and the like.

24:34.620 --> 24:37.120
I don't really like how it looks.

24:37.120 --> 24:40.200
But then again, I didn't like how Wind Waker looks in this neat game,

24:40.200 --> 24:41.640
because, you know,

24:41.640 --> 24:45.340
Link looks deformed and semi-retarded.

24:45.340 --> 24:51.400
Because Link's in... Then again, it's not really Link, so it doesn't matter.

24:51.400 --> 24:53.040
What game is this again?

24:53.040 --> 24:55.440
win-waker

24:55.440 --> 24:59.140
table

24:59.140 --> 25:02.640
babu

25:02.640 --> 25:05.320
japan

25:05.320 --> 25:07.640
uh...

25:07.640 --> 25:11.520
hill is pretty but it makes me throw up a lot of sucks act

25:11.520 --> 25:14.400
hills hill so i think so

25:14.400 --> 25:17.640
hill is not that bad it's good if you like a mindless

25:17.640 --> 25:19.280
adventure shoot him up tight

25:19.280 --> 25:21.120
where did you get them forever

25:21.120 --> 25:22.320
Hello to the Ice Queen, by the way.

25:22.320 --> 25:23.120
Oh yeah, hi.

25:24.120 --> 25:28.620
No, I'm sorry, but Halo was alright, but I thought it got real repetitive after a while,

25:28.620 --> 25:33.520
and Halo 2 is just gonna be just as bad, probably, except you can play it online supposedly, yes or no.

25:33.520 --> 25:34.620
Who knows what they do anymore.

25:34.620 --> 25:38.020
I want them to take the first Doom, and make it look really cool.

25:38.420 --> 25:38.920
Yes.

25:38.920 --> 25:39.620
Doom 3?

25:39.620 --> 25:43.320
No, I don't want Doom 3. I want the first Doom done really cool.

25:43.620 --> 25:44.120
I'm just waiting.

25:44.120 --> 25:48.220
I want them to take Hexen, and not Hexen 2, I want Hexen.

25:48.220 --> 25:59.900
I want them to do a sprite-based, first-person shooter collection, and I want it to work

25:59.900 --> 26:06.140
with the Steel Battalion controller.

26:06.140 --> 26:12.060
And I want them to have level editors so I can play Gachamon Quake.

26:12.060 --> 26:15.140
They did a Gachamon skin for Quake.

26:15.140 --> 26:19.540
I'm trying to figure out how to make a forest level for Counter Strike so I can have the

26:19.540 --> 26:21.060
whole battle royale theme.

26:21.060 --> 26:23.420
I have four characters made out of forty.

26:23.420 --> 26:25.860
There's white cream on my shirt.

26:25.860 --> 26:27.860
No comment!

26:27.860 --> 26:28.860
No I would like to see...

26:28.860 --> 26:33.540
All I'm waiting for is Return to Castle Wolfenstein on the PS2.

26:33.540 --> 26:36.020
Why play it on PS2?

26:36.020 --> 26:40.380
cuz i don't play on the computer soviet you can get all jagaty edges

26:40.380 --> 26:42.720
and motion blur

26:42.720 --> 26:47.880
most of my life jagaty edges in motion blur i'll have you know

26:47.880 --> 26:50.740
you know everybody hates motion blur because of the bouncer it was nothing

26:50.740 --> 26:53.100
but one big blur

26:53.100 --> 26:56.200
or if there was a risk for people that there was to be

26:56.200 --> 27:00.940
i wanted or tend to be a good day actually ended in have yet to play it

27:00.940 --> 27:02.600
i wanted

27:02.600 --> 27:05.600
Well, Dan got it for me because I'm a big Orphan fan. I love the anime.

27:05.600 --> 27:11.600
I wasn't wondering about that, because I've played Orphan, the video game, and it was alright.

27:11.600 --> 27:12.600
I mean, it was...

27:12.600 --> 27:16.600
Well, I wouldn't say it completely sucked, just because I'm like...

27:16.600 --> 27:18.600
I don't know. It was okay.

27:18.600 --> 27:20.600
I slacked off on collecting the DVDs.

27:20.600 --> 27:21.600
But is the DVD worth watching?

27:21.600 --> 27:22.600
Oh God, the anime is awesome.

27:22.600 --> 27:23.600
Really? Okay.

27:23.600 --> 27:26.600
I've got like five laserdiscs of the second series, Orphan Revenge.

27:26.600 --> 27:27.600
How many series are there?

27:27.600 --> 27:28.600
Two.

27:28.600 --> 27:30.600
And I think there's OAVs, I think.

27:30.600 --> 27:31.600
Do they make the box sets?

27:31.600 --> 27:32.600
That's...

27:32.600 --> 27:33.600
Yes.

27:33.600 --> 27:34.600
Yay!

27:34.600 --> 27:35.600
Okay, now I have something to look forward to.

27:35.600 --> 27:37.600
But, dude, well, Orphan's already...

27:37.600 --> 27:41.480
I think the whole series should be out now, back on DVD, but I've only got the first three.

27:41.480 --> 27:44.600
I totally slacked off on it, and I love Orphan.

27:44.600 --> 27:45.860
Cool.

27:45.860 --> 27:50.160
I've played stuff from, music from the series on one of my fuck-off shows before.

27:50.160 --> 27:52.160
Buddha Me 2 is coming out, too.

27:52.160 --> 27:53.160
Which one?

27:53.160 --> 27:54.160
Buddha Me 2.

27:54.160 --> 27:55.160
Oh.

27:55.160 --> 27:56.160
This is...

27:56.160 --> 27:57.160
Welcome to Anime Chat!

27:57.160 --> 27:58.160
Hi.

27:58.160 --> 27:59.160
EOSFBB says, remember Commander Keen?

27:59.160 --> 28:01.160
That game was the shit.

28:01.160 --> 28:05.160
That was the best game except there were like a million sequels and it got redundant.

28:05.160 --> 28:06.160
Jazz the Jackrabbit.

28:06.160 --> 28:07.160
No, I'm sorry.

28:07.160 --> 28:08.160
Best Sonic ripoff ever.

28:08.160 --> 28:12.160
Commander Keen 4 was like better than like Super Nintendo.

28:12.160 --> 28:14.160
Leisure Suit Larry.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.160
Anyway, back to DDR on Xbox.

28:16.160 --> 28:19.160
Wait, it's all about the Crystal Caves.

28:19.160 --> 28:22.160
Who in here remembers Phantasmagoria?

28:22.160 --> 28:24.160
Okay.

28:24.160 --> 28:27.160
A game I never got to play.

28:27.160 --> 28:29.160
I know, I got to see the end of it.

28:29.160 --> 28:34.520
of it but miss annoyed the hell out of me I have missed on Saturn I think I

28:34.520 --> 28:37.800
still have the discs for phantasmagoria around here somewhere I'm gonna have to

28:37.800 --> 28:49.000
find them for you everyone who has a Saturday we own you whatever you have

28:49.000 --> 28:57.760
access I have two patterns also one's modded we add two styles of Saturn's the

28:57.760 --> 29:02.960
The only reason why Jamie always says, everybody who has this raise your hand, because she

29:02.960 --> 29:04.360
has everything.

29:04.360 --> 29:06.260
She will always win.

29:06.260 --> 29:07.260
I don't have a Jaguar.

29:07.260 --> 29:08.260
You don't have a game slave too.

29:08.260 --> 29:11.680
You don't have a crappy Jaguar, good, save yourself.

29:11.680 --> 29:15.920
I want a Jaguar for the version of Tempest 2000 on it.

29:15.920 --> 29:20.360
Did you ever see Sean Baby's list of the 10 worst video games ever?

29:20.360 --> 29:23.520
Like five of them are Jaguar games.

29:23.520 --> 29:27.120
And then the others are the Zelda games on 3DO.

29:27.120 --> 29:33.440
of them was it was a 3d or cdi i think the worst game was what gilligan's island or something

29:33.440 --> 29:37.160
i don't know i'll pull up the list no the worst one the worst things ever is the version

29:37.160 --> 29:43.840
of et that's on the atari 26 yes that's it that was it that was it it was the et on

29:43.840 --> 29:48.200
their whole little rumor is that they had there's like 2300 cartridges buried out in

29:48.200 --> 29:53.780
like mexico or something that is not a rumor it is it really and i would have buried it

29:53.780 --> 29:58.920
forum for free. That was bad and I can't believe they're making another ET game like a million

29:58.920 --> 30:03.020
years after ET came out and is done and gone. They're gonna make... No, they're gonna redo

30:03.020 --> 30:08.020
them to take out the guns and put in cell phones. Return to the green planet or blue

30:08.020 --> 30:13.060
planet or whatever. How about return to my butt? Okay. Let's... This is an... This is

30:13.060 --> 30:17.340

33:09.640 --> 33:12.440
I'll tell you the worst one, hold on, is it on there?

33:12.440 --> 33:13.440
I gotta make sure it's not there.

33:13.440 --> 33:14.440
Well, no, we're gonna go through one through...

33:14.440 --> 33:15.440
Oh, okay.

33:15.440 --> 33:16.440
No, I know what you're trying to say.

33:16.440 --> 33:17.440
All right.

33:17.440 --> 33:20.060
Okay, no, the worst Arnold Schwarzenegger-based game was Predator.

33:20.060 --> 33:21.060
On the NES.

33:21.060 --> 33:22.060
I don't remember Predator.

33:22.060 --> 33:23.260
Oh, it was bad.

33:23.260 --> 33:25.160
You couldn't even jump when you needed to.

33:25.160 --> 33:27.160
You'd like jump on his own.

33:27.160 --> 33:28.160
Do everything on his own.

33:28.160 --> 33:29.160
Oh, my God.

33:29.160 --> 33:31.880
Number 14, Rap Jam, volume one.

33:31.880 --> 33:32.880
Oh, God.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.540
My friend had this game.

33:34.540 --> 33:40.540
You could play Queen Latifah versus Coolio, all in a big game of basketball.

33:40.540 --> 33:42.660
Dude, I'd play as Queen Latifah.

33:42.660 --> 33:46.780
And they say, it says here on Sean Baby's site, Queen Latifah looks like a 130-pound

33:46.780 --> 33:48.180
Mexican boy.

33:48.180 --> 33:50.540
Alright, next.

33:50.540 --> 33:53.140
Number 13 was Air Cars for the Jaguar.

33:53.140 --> 33:54.140
Um, no.

33:54.140 --> 33:55.700
It looks like a piece of poo.

33:55.700 --> 33:58.860
Number 12, I think Jamie owns this, Night Trap.

33:58.860 --> 33:59.860
Yes.

33:59.860 --> 34:03.420
I want the 32X one.

34:03.420 --> 34:07.140
night trap started driving through state of play dole

34:07.140 --> 34:11.300
start and i think it was me night trap was good it was like the first real

34:11.300 --> 34:13.520
controversial game out there that night

34:13.520 --> 34:17.900
chapel required intelligence to play it because you had to know

34:17.900 --> 34:21.260
what you monitor your things and that we've actually been done and i think it

34:21.260 --> 34:24.700
was a little like i really didn't know all this other stuff

34:24.700 --> 34:28.220
i want a new version of maniac mansion yes

34:28.220 --> 34:32.320
it says i always made the house exploded they have a medium as a cartoon

34:32.320 --> 34:35.320
That was a live-action TV show.

34:35.320 --> 34:38.320
I have the data tentacle, and that was funny.

34:38.320 --> 34:39.320
Monster in My Pocket.

34:39.320 --> 34:40.320
Yes.

34:40.320 --> 34:43.320
Monster in My Pocket, before there was Pokemon.

34:43.320 --> 34:47.320
Okay, we're going down Sean Baby's list of the 20 worst games of all time, except it's

34:47.320 --> 34:48.320
a couple years old.

34:48.320 --> 34:49.320
No!

34:49.320 --> 34:50.320
It's Dragonlance!

34:50.320 --> 34:55.320
Number 11 is Dragonlance, Heroes of the Lance.

34:55.320 --> 34:56.320
I want that game.

34:56.320 --> 34:58.320
I don't even remember this game.

34:58.320 --> 34:59.320
Because I love the books.

34:59.320 --> 35:01.320
I don't care if the game sucks.

35:01.320 --> 35:05.320
It sucks. It makes a complete mockery of the books.

35:05.320 --> 35:09.320
I had one of the Dragonlance PC games that came on the big ass floppy disks.

35:09.320 --> 35:13.320
I've never seen the PC version. I've only seen that version and that... no.

35:13.320 --> 35:15.320
Yeah, because I read all the Dragonlance...

35:15.320 --> 35:21.320
Okay, this one I absolutely agree with, because the home versions, even down to the Saturn version,

35:21.320 --> 35:24.320
suck so much ass, Revolution X.

35:24.320 --> 35:26.320
Aerosmith, Stars in Revolution X.

35:26.320 --> 35:39.320
That was only good in the arcade. I could get, I could pick which toilet stall he was in, and I could, because you have to watch, when you first start the game, the cat, the direction that the cat goes in is which way you have to pick the toilet. And then you get one of them.

35:39.320 --> 35:42.320
And I would do the one in the warehouse too.

35:42.320 --> 35:55.320
I just played it yesterday actually at Scandia. It was the best, but the Super Nintendo version was, I gotta say though, the Super NES version was better than the PC version. The PC version was worse.

35:55.320 --> 36:02.320
Okay, number nine. Jamie, do you have this one? Custer's Revenge.

36:02.320 --> 36:05.320
I have a ROM of this. Dan has a ROM of this.

36:05.320 --> 36:08.320
Yeah, I think a lot of people have the ROM, but nobody has the actual cartridge that we know.

36:08.320 --> 36:17.320
If you want to think of it, I may actually have, we have a ROM chip player for 2600, and I think we actually may have the ROM chip for this.

36:17.320 --> 36:29.320
Now for those that don't know what Custer's Revenge is, the way it works is you play a Custer, and your job is to fuck this woman with a feather in her hat over and over again.

36:29.320 --> 36:31.320
That's a dildo on her head.

36:31.320 --> 36:32.320
Or it's a dildo on her head, I don't know.

36:32.320 --> 36:33.320
I like that caption.

36:33.320 --> 36:34.320
And you have to dodge the falling arrows.

36:34.320 --> 36:38.320
I like the caption it says erotic imagery. I've masturbated to sexier Legos

36:40.960 --> 36:42.960
Okay, dude x-man is not on this

36:43.320 --> 36:48.720
What's x-man x-man was this one where you you play as this little he looks like scissors except

36:48.720 --> 36:51.160
It's a guy with a big dick the size of his body

36:51.160 --> 36:55.340
And you walk through a maze and then when you get to the center of the maze and avoid the traps

36:55.560 --> 36:58.880
You like have to there's this woman on all fours and you have to bone her

36:58.880 --> 37:04.640
number eight white men can't jump for the Jaguar

37:04.640 --> 37:07.800
whoops there it is

37:07.800 --> 37:13.280
I hate that game I haven't played it because I got flacked for my last name

37:13.280 --> 37:16.960
because of that stupid movie

37:16.960 --> 37:21.120
number seven superman 64

37:21.120 --> 37:25.720
played it never got it I knew it had potential to be cool

37:25.720 --> 37:32.720
6. Zelda, the Wand of Gamelon

37:55.720 --> 37:57.720
This picture is about to give somebody head.

37:57.720 --> 38:00.720
Dude, it's like, it's the designs from the costume series.

38:00.720 --> 38:02.720
Oh, yeah, it's so good.

38:02.720 --> 38:05.720
Well, excuse me, princess.

38:05.720 --> 38:09.720
Why is Link being played by Prince?

38:09.720 --> 38:11.720
That's all I want to know.

38:11.720 --> 38:13.720
All right, number five.

38:13.720 --> 38:16.720
He's not Link anymore, he's like, an ocarina is like what his symbol is.

38:16.720 --> 38:19.720
A game for the 3DO called Virtuoso.

38:19.720 --> 38:21.720
Virtuoso, oh my god, no.

38:21.720 --> 38:23.720
Being played by, um...

38:23.720 --> 38:24.720
A hairband guy.

38:24.720 --> 38:25.720
It's Vince Neil.

38:25.720 --> 38:26.720
It's a succeeded film.

38:26.720 --> 38:27.720
4.

38:27.720 --> 38:28.720
Captain Novolin.

38:28.720 --> 38:29.720
No, what was it on?

38:29.720 --> 38:30.720
It's a game about diabetes.

38:30.720 --> 38:47.720
It was put together not to educate children about diabetes, but to blatantly taunt their

38:47.720 --> 38:48.720
disease.

38:48.720 --> 38:54.600
Okay, I've played better flash games than what this looks like.

38:54.600 --> 39:03.640
There's this flash game about sexually transmitted diseases, and you have to catch the jizz in

39:03.640 --> 39:07.760
a condom.

39:07.760 --> 39:11.680
This helpful nurse will come out and say, you need to check your blood sugar four times

39:11.680 --> 39:14.520
a day, but you can check it more often if you like.

39:14.520 --> 39:15.520
That's a helpful...

39:15.520 --> 39:16.640
I don't want to stick a needle in my finger.

39:16.640 --> 39:18.640
Here, let me do it 20 times a day.

39:18.640 --> 39:22.640
No. Diabetes is nothing to joke about, but that's why this game is so bad.

39:22.640 --> 39:24.640
I know it's not, but still, it's rather wrong.

39:24.640 --> 39:26.640
That's why this game is bad.

39:26.640 --> 39:28.640
Fight for life.

39:28.640 --> 39:30.640
Number 3 is a game called Fight for Life from the Jaguar.

39:30.640 --> 39:32.640
I think this game sucks.

39:32.640 --> 39:37.640
Wow. It looks awful. Why is the sky green in there?

39:37.640 --> 39:40.640
Wait a minute, that's one of my old nicknames.

39:40.640 --> 39:41.640
Number 2 is...

39:41.640 --> 39:45.640
Yes, Rob's old nickname is Why is the Sky Green Back There?

39:45.640 --> 39:49.000
Number two is a game called Club Drive for the Jaguar.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.480
It looks like, um, you remember Hard Drivin'?

39:51.480 --> 39:52.480
Yes.

39:52.480 --> 39:54.880
It looks like hard driving, like, but shittier.

39:54.880 --> 39:58.800
Dude, I actually have a cool story about hard drivin'.

39:58.800 --> 40:02.720
You know the deluxe one that had the chair that swung in and out and fell into the really

40:02.720 --> 40:04.840
dark covered machine?

40:04.840 --> 40:05.840
Mm-hmm.

40:05.840 --> 40:09.960
Well, one time I was working at my arcade, and no one, I hadn't, didn't have any sleep

40:09.960 --> 40:15.120
the night before, so I took a nap in one of those for four hours, and no one came in the

40:15.120 --> 40:18.360
whole time

40:18.360 --> 40:19.520
number one

40:19.520 --> 40:21.120
as we mentioned earlier

40:21.120 --> 40:23.160
the number one worst game of all time

40:23.160 --> 40:26.340
e t the extra game and it's

40:26.340 --> 40:28.120
all

40:28.120 --> 40:29.920
pretty off me that

40:29.920 --> 40:34.080
and and and and and the whole game

40:34.080 --> 40:38.640
although i would actually and and and and and and and and and and and and and

40:38.640 --> 40:40.560
with the e t sprite

40:40.560 --> 40:41.860
and a big

40:41.860 --> 40:43.920
anti

40:43.920 --> 40:45.920
Don't be doggin' E.T.

40:45.920 --> 40:47.920
Dude, I want a shirt with the dragon on it.

40:47.920 --> 40:51.920
We should open up an Orange Lounge store that sells these things.

40:51.920 --> 40:53.920
One of those crappy Cafe E-Press stores.

40:53.920 --> 40:55.920
I've got one, too.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.920
Well, let's just take a look.

40:57.920 --> 40:59.920
All right.

40:59.920 --> 41:01.920
I think what we're going to do at this point...

41:01.920 --> 41:09.920
Did everybody get off their chest what they wanted to say about DDR on the Xbox and all?

41:09.920 --> 41:12.920
I think that picked up on the mic.

41:12.920 --> 41:15.280
quick question for you guys we're getting asked by the chat room about

41:15.280 --> 41:20.120
this and I said yes because I know at least I'll be here next Sunday is Easter

41:20.120 --> 41:26.520
are we still doing a show yeah anybody anybody have to celebrate Easter only if

41:26.520 --> 41:31.560
I get to burn something I get Easter is really about the eggs who gives a crap

41:31.560 --> 41:35.920
about this Jesus shit not going to be celebrating Easter we're gonna celebrate

41:35.920 --> 41:37.920
Let's celebrate my birthday!

42:05.920 --> 42:13.920
Oh, where did 420 come from? 420 is the police code. You know how there's all these police codes for different crimes? 420 is smoking marijuana.

42:13.920 --> 42:18.920
I've got a 1337. I wonder what a 1337 is in police code.

42:18.920 --> 42:20.920
I call a homestar runner break.

42:20.920 --> 42:25.920
A homestar runner break? You want to do a homestar runner break? Did you bring some on your CD here?

42:30.920 --> 42:32.920
And now more sounds of E.T.

42:32.920 --> 42:34.920
In two weeks, however, we'll be taped.

42:37.920 --> 42:39.920
Why are you sending me to Home Star Runner?

42:39.920 --> 43:00.920
I have no idea what Jamie's doing.

43:00.920 --> 43:04.040
She just took over my computer and she's loading up stuff on her Star Runner.

43:04.040 --> 43:07.320
On my computer, I have it loaded to where it'll start up.

43:07.320 --> 43:11.320
Hello stupid and welcome to your crappy computer.

43:11.320 --> 43:12.320
I want that.

43:12.320 --> 43:14.320
I can send you the MP3 if you really want it.

43:14.320 --> 43:15.320
Cool.

43:15.320 --> 43:21.320
It's from, it's Strong Bad saying it so it's pretty cool.

43:21.320 --> 43:24.320
Oh dear.

43:24.320 --> 43:29.320
Loading, loading, loading.

43:29.320 --> 43:31.320
Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh.

43:31.320 --> 43:35.320
I'm glad underscore v-mail dot v-x-e.

43:35.320 --> 43:36.320
Answer.

43:36.320 --> 43:40.320
Dear Strongback, why don't you and the Chief pull a caper of some sort?

43:40.320 --> 43:44.320
It seems like there's been little cooperation between the two of you as of late.

43:44.320 --> 43:46.320
James, Detroit mate.

43:46.320 --> 43:48.320
Well, you're right.

43:48.320 --> 43:54.320
It's no secret that the Chief and I haven't been getting along very well since he screwed up our last caper.

43:54.320 --> 43:58.320
I don't care about the crosswords, man. Just the jumbles. The jumbles.

43:58.320 --> 43:59.320
I don't know.

43:59.320 --> 44:00.320
I don't know. Go look over there.

44:00.320 --> 44:02.320
Look out!

44:02.320 --> 44:04.320
Oh great man!

44:09.320 --> 44:11.320
He's tall and sad.

44:11.320 --> 44:12.320
Batman.

44:12.320 --> 44:14.320
Who are you going to steal from my house?

44:14.320 --> 44:15.320
We've been ID'd.

44:15.320 --> 44:17.320
Every man for himself!

44:17.320 --> 44:20.320
Thanks for stopping by you guys.

44:20.320 --> 44:23.320
Thanks for breaking my cowlamp.

44:23.320 --> 44:25.320
The cheat man.

44:26.320 --> 44:28.320
Where did we go wrong?

44:28.320 --> 44:33.320
Seems like just yesterday we were setting fire to Strong Sam's Underwears.

44:33.320 --> 44:34.320
I was yesterday.

44:34.320 --> 44:35.320
This one's for you.

44:35.320 --> 44:39.320
I got mad at the cheat

44:39.320 --> 44:45.320
For screwing up the jumbled paper

44:45.320 --> 44:48.320
I hope I don't see his name in the paper

44:48.320 --> 44:52.320
In the obituaries

44:52.320 --> 44:54.320
His dad would mean he's dead

44:54.320 --> 45:00.860
I'm so glad to cheaters not dead, the cheaters not dead

45:00.860 --> 45:08.740
I'm so glad to cheaters not dead, the cheaters not dead

45:08.740 --> 45:17.380
I'm so glad to cheaters not, Just a clap, just a clap

45:17.380 --> 45:18.880
I didn't know you had any rhythm.

45:18.880 --> 45:20.380
Oh sure, I got tons of rhythm.

45:20.380 --> 45:21.380
You got the clap.

45:22.880 --> 45:24.880
Keep it rolling for me guys, keep it rolling.

45:28.880 --> 45:29.880
The cheetah.

45:29.880 --> 45:30.880
I just wanted to say that.

45:30.880 --> 45:31.880
Uh huh.

45:31.880 --> 45:33.880
Oh, I can't stay mad at you.

45:35.380 --> 45:37.880
Oh, how about a little kick for old time's sake.

45:38.880 --> 45:40.880
And I'll have these kids, man.

45:41.380 --> 45:42.380
But I don't...

45:44.880 --> 45:45.880
Who's that?

45:45.880 --> 45:49.880
Whoa! Watch me now! I had you there!

45:51.880 --> 45:52.880
Okay.

45:52.880 --> 45:53.880
Dude, what the hell was that?

46:01.880 --> 46:03.880
You guys are so cute!

46:04.880 --> 46:07.880
I should probably get dressed or something.

46:07.880 --> 46:09.880
What is it, like three in the afternoon?

46:10.880 --> 46:12.880
Looking good, Homestar!

46:12.880 --> 46:13.880
Yeah, what's the deal?

46:13.880 --> 46:15.880
Here, I didn't know you had to shave.

46:15.880 --> 46:17.880
Oh, I don't. It's Cinnamon.

46:45.880 --> 46:51.880
for a long long time two weeks ago during March Madness we had the world

46:51.880 --> 46:58.720
debut of Kyle Snyder's song I could never be Japanese and you guys tonight

46:58.720 --> 47:08.000
here it is an opportunity to go poop so this is it this is it the world premiere

47:08.000 --> 47:11.440
well the second second premiere I guess because we already did this once we're

47:11.440 --> 47:21.440
This is a clip from March Madness of Kyle Snyder singing his new song, I Can Never Be Japanese. Enjoy, you guys.

47:21.440 --> 47:29.440
I remember when I was young It would come every Saturday evening

47:29.440 --> 47:36.440
I would watch some Japanese TV It never did get boring

47:36.440 --> 47:44.440
It was all I cared about There was nothing else for me to do

47:44.440 --> 47:51.440
Then I suddenly hit reality And a message came through

47:51.440 --> 47:59.440
I could never be Japanese No matter what it would never be

47:59.440 --> 48:05.440
Even though I never gave up hope I had to face reality

48:05.440 --> 48:24.440
I thought it would all end there, but somehow I kept going on I'm so interested in Japanese culture and that is why I wrote this song

48:24.440 --> 48:33.440
If it weren't for my brother, I wouldn't know much about your culture

48:33.440 --> 48:39.440
I would be so ignorant, it would be pure torture

48:39.440 --> 48:47.440
I'm sure there are others who are into Japanese culture too

48:47.440 --> 48:51.240
I'm glad I'm not the only one

48:51.240 --> 48:54.880
Otherwise I'd probably be a fool

48:54.880 --> 48:58.040
I could never be Japanese

48:58.040 --> 49:02.000
No matter what it would never be

49:02.000 --> 49:05.480
Even though I never gave up hope

49:05.480 --> 49:09.080
I had to face reality

49:09.080 --> 49:12.640
I thought it would all end there

49:12.640 --> 49:16.760
Yet somehow I kept going on

49:16.760 --> 49:20.760
I'm so interested in Japanese culture

49:20.760 --> 49:26.760
That is why I wrote this song

49:27.760 --> 49:30.760
There was much I didn't know

49:30.760 --> 49:34.760
That I learned as the time flew by

49:34.760 --> 49:37.760
I was shocked about what I learned

49:37.760 --> 49:40.760
I didn't know why

49:40.760 --> 49:44.760
Then it started to come to me

49:44.760 --> 49:51.760
Though I wasn't born in Japan, life would be too hard for me

49:51.760 --> 49:55.760
It must be part of the Lord's plan

49:55.760 --> 49:58.760
I could never be Japanese

49:58.760 --> 50:02.760
No matter what it would never be

50:02.760 --> 50:09.760
Even though I never gave up hope, I had to face reality

50:09.760 --> 50:19.880
I thought it would all end there, but somehow I kept going on, I'm so interested in Japanese

50:19.880 --> 50:27.280
culture, and that is why I wrote this song.

50:27.280 --> 50:36.580
I could never be Japanese, no matter what it would never be, even though I never gave

50:36.580 --> 50:40.580
I had to face reality

50:40.580 --> 50:44.580
I thought it would all end there

50:44.580 --> 50:48.580
Yet somehow I kept going on

50:48.580 --> 50:52.580
I'm so interested in Japanese culture

50:52.580 --> 51:01.580
And that is why I wrote this song

51:22.580 --> 51:24.580
This is fucked up

51:54.580 --> 52:00.080
Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is...

52:00.080 --> 52:02.080
This is fucked up.

52:07.080 --> 52:09.080
This is fucked up.

53:39.080 --> 53:59.960
And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's

53:59.960 --> 54:02.560
favorite perverse baumanni band, Erotic.

54:02.560 --> 54:04.200
Do it all night.

54:04.200 --> 54:05.720
Do it with me.

54:05.720 --> 54:08.440
No, no, that was awful, bloody terrible.

54:08.440 --> 54:11.440
Why don't you take vocal lessons? Kill your teacher!

54:11.440 --> 54:12.440
In the heat of the night.

54:12.440 --> 54:15.440
Oh god, I think my ears are bleeding.

54:15.440 --> 54:17.440
I liked it.

54:17.440 --> 54:20.440
Shut the bloody hell up, Paula. Next!

54:20.440 --> 54:24.440
Oh, that was cool.

54:24.440 --> 54:29.440
Do you even know why you're here? That was just bloody pathetic. Next!

54:29.440 --> 54:34.440
Come on, baby. Come on, do it with me.

54:34.440 --> 54:37.440
Yes, yes, that's it! We have a winner!

54:37.440 --> 54:42.440
A star is born here on Orange Lounge Radio.

55:07.440 --> 55:11.240
while I was singing, and I'm trying not to laugh. My face is actually bright red.

55:11.240 --> 55:14.920
He walks away, I drop the microphone, and burst it into laughter.

55:14.920 --> 55:18.800
It was so bad. That's why he got interrupted the first time.

55:18.800 --> 55:22.740
Alright, the studio's

55:22.740 --> 55:27.120
just erupted into chaos because we just had arriving. We have Dark Child's in the house, yay!

55:27.120 --> 55:31.440
D Child in the heezy pacheezy.

55:31.440 --> 55:36.400
And also back there, DDR Hollie, say hello.

55:36.400 --> 55:38.400
Hi everybody!

55:38.400 --> 55:40.400
Look kids, we have a new mixing board, isn't it pretty?

55:40.400 --> 55:42.400
Yes, knows how you do not hear, but...

55:42.400 --> 55:43.400
Where's the mixing board?

55:43.400 --> 55:44.400
Ow!

55:44.400 --> 55:47.400
That's worse, I feel bad for the people at home.

55:47.400 --> 55:50.400
Also in that break, if you enjoyed that fucked up mix of Schlagwerk...

55:50.400 --> 55:52.400
Ooh, yummy, cookie.

55:52.400 --> 55:55.400
If you enjoyed that fucked up mix of Schlagwerk, you can thank Loki for that.

55:55.400 --> 55:59.400
That's the dark, uh, that's the Schlagwerk, Dark Sakura will fuck you up mix.

55:59.400 --> 56:02.400
Everybody should fuck someone up for that last one.

56:02.400 --> 56:05.400
Also Gamelan de Couple, which we're finally starting to get...

56:05.400 --> 56:15.400
We're starting to get some feedback in the chatroom that you know what you guys? Maybe that's overplayed a little bit. Do you think so? Do you think that song is overplayed or what?

56:15.400 --> 56:18.400
It's back all over again everybody!

56:18.400 --> 56:22.400
I have never ever had one of these before. Do I push the marble in?

56:22.400 --> 56:25.400
No. Did you take the plastic off?

56:25.400 --> 56:26.400
I took the plastic thing off.

56:26.400 --> 56:28.400
Well there should be a green thing in there.

56:28.400 --> 56:29.400
Oh.

56:29.400 --> 56:36.400
now it's not

56:37.920 --> 56:42.600
oh yeah i'm getting a lesson you take your thingy off

56:42.600 --> 56:44.400
yeah it's good

56:44.400 --> 56:48.360
cool

56:48.360 --> 56:49.920
yeah it's

56:49.920 --> 56:51.580
they do

56:51.580 --> 56:54.680
no i don't want to see that

56:54.680 --> 56:56.680
What? I haven't thought of it for a season.

56:56.680 --> 56:58.680
What is this?

56:58.680 --> 57:00.680
Everybody use your imagination at home.

57:00.680 --> 57:02.680
I stuck it in my mouth.

57:02.680 --> 57:06.680
Or better not, don't use your imagination at home.

57:06.680 --> 57:11.680
Rob just didn't want to get it on the floor.

57:11.680 --> 57:15.680
You know I just had to lick that all up.

57:15.680 --> 57:19.680
Better to let it shoot off in your mouth, right?

57:19.680 --> 57:26.680
Oh my God, my friend Garrett, earlier this week he took me to, what's that Japanese store?

57:26.680 --> 57:29.840
Oh, Toto's I think it's called?

57:29.840 --> 57:31.220
I think that's what the place was called.

57:31.220 --> 57:36.460
It's over on, and I apologize for those out of Sacramento who aren't going to get this,

57:36.460 --> 57:41.700
it's on Fruit Ridge and, Fruit Ridge and what's the other after, Freeport and Fruit Ridge.

57:41.700 --> 57:42.700
That's where it is.

57:42.700 --> 57:43.700
That's like a mile away from my house.

57:43.700 --> 57:44.700
Okay.

57:44.700 --> 57:45.700
They have...

57:45.700 --> 57:49.120
If you're not in a car, don't go throughout the area, you will die.

57:49.120 --> 57:50.840
I'm done.

57:50.840 --> 57:54.280
We went and we got that and there was a reason I was

57:54.280 --> 57:54.760
telling this story.

57:54.760 --> 57:58.640
Oh yes, he bought the explosive Hello Kitty drink.

57:58.640 --> 58:00.520
And it's this drink and it has Hello Kitty on it.

58:00.520 --> 58:03.920
And it tastes like, do you remember those fruit candies

58:03.920 --> 58:07.000
Mamba from high school?

58:07.000 --> 58:08.240
Mamba candies.

58:08.240 --> 58:12.040
It tastes like a liquid version of Mamba candies.

58:12.040 --> 58:15.440
But when you open it, it opens worse than a bottle of

58:15.440 --> 58:15.840
champagne.

58:15.840 --> 58:16.960
He has to point it away.

58:16.960 --> 58:18.560
We open it in his backyard.

58:18.560 --> 58:23.160
And when you open it, the plastic top flew 40 yards, and he didn't even shake it.

58:23.160 --> 58:24.760
So that's why we call it the explosive Hello Kitty drink.

58:24.760 --> 58:27.560
You should shake it.

58:27.560 --> 58:31.160
Yo, watch this, pointy-handed bird.

58:31.160 --> 58:33.880
Shake it and take it to RVGL.

58:33.880 --> 58:34.600
Oh!

58:34.600 --> 58:35.440
Oh my god!

58:35.440 --> 58:39.800
That's a great idea. Who wants to take an exploding Hello Kitty drink to RVGL?

58:39.800 --> 58:43.440
We can, like, shake it up, like... First of all, who wants to go to RVGL? Cricket noise.

58:43.440 --> 58:49.200
you can hurt you know i think it's an rv g l

58:49.200 --> 58:53.900
i dislike pick the crap out of some stupid little river kids

58:53.900 --> 58:58.000
ideally funding for me to do it i'd be jealous to have people thrown out

58:58.000 --> 59:01.400
which i do and that's one of these every time we go to another uh... he was

59:01.400 --> 59:03.460
looking at me for a like him and he had else

59:03.460 --> 59:06.160
now i do that can if i don't like people there

59:06.160 --> 59:07.660
i haven't run out

59:07.660 --> 59:10.480
and the people happen out of the people who are being disruptive and causing a

59:10.480 --> 59:11.920
big thing anyway right

59:11.920 --> 59:13.920
So, I have people throw it out all the time.

59:18.920 --> 59:19.920
I'm eating.

59:22.420 --> 59:23.920
You know, we kind of got it on a tangent.

59:23.920 --> 59:25.420
We were talking about bimani news.

59:25.420 --> 59:26.920
We had tons of it to cover.

59:26.920 --> 59:28.920
And then I got my pillow back.

59:28.920 --> 59:29.920
Kickass!

59:29.920 --> 59:30.920
Everybody!

59:30.920 --> 59:31.920
Everybody!

59:35.920 --> 59:36.920
What do you want to talk about now then?

59:36.920 --> 59:37.920
Sleepy time!

59:37.920 --> 59:39.920
There's still plenty of bimani to talk about.

59:39.920 --> 59:45.400
about something new? Sure. Let's talk about DDR Ultra Mix. I was about to say that. That

59:45.400 --> 59:52.400
is the stupidest idea in the world. Why? It's DDR PC 2. No, it's Ultra Mix. Get it right.

59:53.960 --> 59:58.880
It's Ultra Crack. I mean, ooh, what, are we going to have more lovely characters that

59:58.880 --> 01:00:05.880
we're all going to drool all over? No. Trojan Man is the first unlocked, just so you know.

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:12.880
This is being leaked, by the way. Somebody had discovered this on the ratings board website.

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:15.880
There was this website that you go to to get the ratings.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.880
How sad is it that people browse that site to look for new games that are coming out?

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:19.880
Huh?

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.880
Yeah, it worked.

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:32.880
This is something I brought up in the chat room a few nights ago when I mentioned this for no apparent reason.

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:39.880
It's like, probably about 85-90% of the Bimani community, probably worldwide, knows about

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:45.520
StepMania or knows about DWI. So it's like, why waste however much they're going to try

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:51.100
to charge you for this stupid-ass game and just go spend a few hours a day downloading

01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:55.000
a bunch of songs and you'll be just fine? Or do you really want the most retarded characters

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
in the world?

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.960
Because it's all about the kick-ass characters and the possibility that there might be new

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:05.940
new stuff even though there will never be new stuff. Now, Jazz in the chat room makes

01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:13.180
a good point. You can't judge it till you play it. Oh, okay. Sure. I'm going by track

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:19.200
record here. Well, I don't know. If I'm correct, I've heard that from plenty of people before

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:23.600
DDRPC came out. You know, oh, you can't judge it before you play it and then you play it

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:26.440
and they get mad at you for judging it

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:30.880
it sucked and they all suck

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:33.600
wait what am i sorry did you say i was a guy?

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.880
alright i heard that about anal sex one time but uh...

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:40.660
i'm not going to try it i'll judge it before i try it

01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:45.000
you know we were doing really good with this show not going any type of porno way

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.720
and now all of a sudden ANAL SEX POP

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:54.720
the

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:59.000
the

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.680
the

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:06.300
house and i saw a seriously

01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:09.240
the else has something they want to say about uh...

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.300
the role to mix

01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:15.800
what new characters can we look forward to wonderful ideas will come out of

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.760
America come out with

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:19.200
ultra active

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.000
there's a list

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.000
will we get another paranoia

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.640
nope

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:29.240
did i'm so tired of her and i

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:31.360
may have one more time and i want to find someone

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:33.960
you know i don't think there are a lot of survival and i had

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.160
that was the only way

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:37.520
good one that in evolution

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:41.120
well marionette survivor max is so original to with it and if you think i

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:44.000
was led up

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.460
all rightly as far as i'm concerned

01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:47.660
paranoid is done

01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:49.360
now he needs to die

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:50.580
and

01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:54.180
well though he died and there would be no songs for dvd art is every hour to

01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:58.420
say but that may be good cool do all the music that we need to get me to cool

01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:00.420
intact to do all the music

01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:04.280
and talk at the

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.640
but no key

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:12.060
now he needs to go back and do more great music

01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:14.660
it here you know that

01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:16.660
and yet we need more young ok

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:17.740
uh...

01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:19.260
but seriously though they were

01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:20.860
what they need to do

01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:24.360
didn't seem like everything with the action which is being lazy

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:27.460
but they're leading in the whole of my system they're lazy on the songs that

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:30.880
they put in there they're lazy on the soundtrack to be released

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.380
into the whole things like you know

01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:37.860
i could have made this a good game but you know i just kinda want to sit down

01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:39.780
and sleep

01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:46.780
Here's something more fascinating than DDR, whatever that crap is, Ultimate Battle 22.

01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:49.780
We went to extreme.

01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:52.780
Meat eating Pucky is more amusing.

01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:58.780
Here's the reason why I figured they didn't really care about how well they made extreme.

01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:01.780
Because they know that they have the fan base, and they know that every-

01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:04.780
That's wrong, I don't want to see that, thank you.

01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:07.780
Anyways, they know that people are going to play a game no matter what.

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:10.780
For the record, Rob did something phallic.

01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:48.780
Anyways, yeah, so Ultramix sucks ass, and I won't buy it, but I'll download it off of some site, I'm sure.

01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:50.780
I have video game news.

01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:51.780
Oh.

01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:52.780
I got you something.

01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:55.780
Hold on a minute. Jamie, everybody has an announcement.

01:04:55.780 --> 01:05:10.580
I have two announcements, and neither of them are related to Bivani, shock shock shock shock!

01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:17.140
The first one is in a few weeks from now, in IRC, or possibly AIM if I'm feeling like

01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:22.620
being, you know, nice to people who don't use IRC, I'm going to be running a battle

01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:31.660
royale game stat-based like a tabletop game except on IRC and then I saw

01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:36.820
something cool one of my friends online made me download something cool it was

01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:41.980
the the teaser for Kingdom Hearts 2

01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:51.340
it's it's really cool except there's all this like neat hardcore fighting and

01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:58.020
It's like one of the people doing hardcore fighting, landing in cool poses while wearing lots of black is Mickey Mouse

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:03.440
So with all this hardcore fighting, is there any hardcore sex?

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:08.400
I don't want to know about that associated with Kingdom Hearts 2. Thank you very much

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:14.060
Yes, I do. You just do it with the Final Fantasy characters. You don't do with the Disney characters

01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:31.260
this is the best fan art ever for anyone who remembers the race at the beginning of Kingdom

01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:38.260
Kingdom Hearts. This is the best fanart ever.

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:44.060
What's the score now, Eric? Don't you agree?

01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:49.060
Final Fuck X, yay! Kingdom Heart On.

01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:56.060
I don't know, maybe that's the name of the doujinshi somewhere.

01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:58.060
Kingdom hurts!

01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:00.060
Kingdom hurts!

01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:02.060
Oh my god.

01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:04.060
This could like take up the whole show right here.

01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:06.060
I'm fine with that.

01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:08.060
RPG related

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:12.060
Like Secret of Mana, Secret of Flesh or something.

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:14.060
Welcome to the Temple of But.

01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:16.060
Poking at Mana.

01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:20.060
Ness151 in our chat room has an interesting motto for life.

01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:24.060
When life gives you a lemon, toss it back and scream HENTAI!

01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:26.060
Toss it back and scream, HENTAI!

01:07:54.060 --> 01:08:02.660
You know, my friend was telling me about this porn, about this lemon, but never mind.

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:06.180
When life gives me lemons, I poison the lemonade.

01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:07.180
That's beautiful.

01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:11.340
When life gives me lemons, I decide to talk about something else.

01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:17.380
Okay, anyways, DDR Max 2 obviously is coming out in like two weeks, more information being

01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:19.460
released by Konami.

01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:24.060
Of course, we know we were, you know, assuming that there's going to be more stuff about

01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:28.980
the being able to create Oni's and that is in there, that you can create your own Oni

01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:29.980
courses.

01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:30.980
So that's kind of cool.

01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:34.060
Plus, as before, we were talking about previous songs from DDR Extreme which are going to

01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:35.060
be in there.

01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:43.700
Two confirmed songs from Konami right now are Level of Shine and Crash.

01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:48.900
Stop it with the ninja cookie thingies, crackers.

01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:51.820
I am disappointed by this box of pokey.

01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:57.060
It does not have a special unit CD, but the words special unit are really funny.

01:08:57.060 --> 01:09:00.700
I have a special unit.

01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:04.740
You and your special unit can go stand in the hall, sir.

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:06.700
Will there be any good porno in the hall?

01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:10.380
Yeah, why don't you go see?

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:13.540
Then I guess me and my special unit won't be working together today.

01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:16.700
Oh, there's a barcode.

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:24.680
code I win a special unit CD I've been asked to play a movie that we got here

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:28.280
in the chat room I don't know this might cause drops though so if this causes too

01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:31.200
many drops we're gonna have to cut we're gonna have to cut this segment but we'll

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:34.940
try it because I have done movies on the show way back on episode number like

01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:38.300
three or something you remember that whole controversy I wasn't here I

01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:45.520
remember I remember ever the you know it's like a giant spaceship place oh

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:47.520
Oh yeah, we did play that. You were here for that.

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:49.520
We need to do that promo back in.

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.520
We'll play that after the next break.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.520
Okay, but anyway, let's see if this will work.

01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:57.520
I don't know, we might have some dropouts, but we'll see if it works.

01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:59.520
Okay.

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:01.520
Loading, loadingly.

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:03.520
Here we go!

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:09.520
Zelda, Duke Onkka is under attack by the evil forces of Ganon.

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:11.520
I'm going to Gamelon to aid him.

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:13.520
But father, what if something happens to you?

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:16.520
I'll take the Triforce of Courage to protect me.

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:19.520
If you don't hear from me in a month, send Link.

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:20.520
Ampa!

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:22.520
Don't worry, Zelda.

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:26.520
The Triforce of Wisdom promises the king will safely return.

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:29.520
Enough! My ship sails in the morning.

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:32.520
I wonder what's for dinner?

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:36.520
Oh boy! I'm so hungry, I could eat it off the rock!

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:41.520
I'm so hungry, I could eat Zelda!

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:48.520
he's Zelda. Shut up, you hippie!

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:58.080
Dude, she's touching him erotically.

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.080
Dude, Link is totally gay.

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:02.080
Great, great.

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:04.080
Wake up, Impa. We're going to Gamelon.

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:08.080
Alright, dear. I'll get the Triforce of Wisdom.

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:16.080
Beautiful. You wanna see another movie from that game?

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.080
What's that Gamelon?

01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:18.080
Alright.

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:19.080
One more.

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:22.080
Since there's such a huge demand for it, let's see another movie.

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:25.080
Rob, can you give me back those minutes of life you just wasted?

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:27.080
No. In fact, I'm gonna take more.

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:30.080
Gee, it sure is boring around here.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.080
My boy!

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:32.080
Cuz I'm playing this game!

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:34.080
I'm a true warrior strive for!

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:35.080
I just wonder what Ganon's up to.

01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:36.080
He's wearing lipstick.

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:37.080
No teeth.

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:41.080
Your majesty, Ganon's up to the island of Koridai.

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:42.080
Oh my god!

01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:44.080
A son of bin lion came to visit them!

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:47.080
Hmm, how can we help?

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:51.080
It is written, only Link can defeat Ganon.

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:52.080
Great!

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:53.080
I'll grab my stuff!

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:54.080
There is no time.

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:56.080
By Ganon we mean George Bush.

01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:03.520

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:12.200

01:12:46.700 --> 01:13:12.460
the game is not recognized as part of the Zelda universe.

01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:18.280
I don't know, did you play Majora's Mask?

01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:23.280
Yeah, Majora's Ass.

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:24.460
Um...

01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:27.100
Yeah. So...

01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:30.560
Also in Bamani news this week, we can talk about this. This is big news.

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:32.460
This has all the kids excited.

01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:34.140
2DX Night Style!

01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:37.940
Is location testing!

01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:45.140
I love the look on his face.

01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:50.020
Some of the songs that are going to be in 2DX9 style, I have to find the link to that

01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:52.460
page.

01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:53.460
They have it?

01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:56.340
I'm going, I'm trying that, but there was another, there was another site that also

01:13:56.340 --> 01:14:00.500
had, there's a site, the Japanese site that had all the 8th style location tests that

01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:02.780
has it too, and I don't remember where that's at.

01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:10.780
I am two seconds behind Rob on Legend of Max.

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:12.780
Since I could finally get back to the stage now.

01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:16.780
I don't remember where that one site was, the Japanese site.

01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:22.780
It's not coming up.

01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:23.780
Snore.

01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:25.780
Thank you, somebody gave me a good link.

01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:28.780
Thank you, Arcadian42, you gave me a good link here.

01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:31.780
That's the one I was looking for.

01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:03.780
They're going through the whole solar system.

01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:05.780
That'll be beautiful.

01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:08.780
Sampling Masters Aya, Sampling Masters Mega, both of them.

01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:09.780
Emotion 2003.

01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:13.780
Emotion 2003, which is EOS remixed by Taka.

01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:17.780
But I thought Taka did the Emotion remix that's in Core.

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:18.780
BeatMania Core.

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:20.780
Well, that was also called Romantic.

01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:22.780
So it might be the same damn song, for all we know.

01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:25.780
No, it's Emotion 2003. Get it right.

01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:30.780
Good Cool, featuring Andrea L. Hopkins, called Your Body.

01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:34.780
You got a grooved, extended joy style.

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:37.780
A new Naoki Underground song called Prelude.

01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:41.780
Akira Yamaka with a song that's in Japanese.

01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:47.780
I think it's called Body, or that's the genre's body.

01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:50.780
Lion something.

01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:53.780
Lion something.

01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:57.780
No new Orange Lounge song in 2DX9 style, which is kinda spooky.

01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:06.780
This is the Heavens remix by Ryu, the guy that won the remix contest back then who did Starmine.

01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:10.780
I believe he has a new song in this also.

01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:13.780
Ryu has a new song? I didn't see that listed.

01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:18.780
I thought. I looked the list really quickly.

01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:24.080
chat rooms, kind of making some observations, like there's a lot of collaborations. Oh,

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:31.360
Arcadians got it. It's Lion Suki. That's it. No new Orange Lounge song listed as of yet,

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:35.480
but if I remember right with eight styles test, the Orange Lounge song didn't show up

01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:41.200
until after, it didn't show up till later. I want Pocky.

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:47.040
There was also two different ones. There's sampling masters Aya and I guess Aya, whatever,

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:22.560
Okay, here we go. There's some screenshots of night style right there. Again, it's very

01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:27.840
blue and orange. It's got like the space station theme here. It's kind of interesting. But

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:32.980
look at this. What do these look like?

01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:33.980
Looks like e-cards.

01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:35.600
They look like e-cards.

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:44.100
Because they say E on the bottom. That's the whole... Okay, how much you want to bet? Okay,

01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:45.100
I'm going to...

01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:51.660
here first there will be e-cards for Extreme 2. Oh for the new DDR whatever it is? Oh I'll bet you

01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:58.540
I bet you there will be in fact it will get rid of the whole memory card thing. It seems to be the

01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:04.860
way where Konami is going between Guitar Freaks and Pop Music. I have this feeling that they're

01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:09.500
going to bring out some type of reader to use with your PlayStation 2 or whatever that reads

01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:14.900
those cards you know another system they tried to do that with the Neo Geo where

01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:19.980
the old MBS units you could take a card and put it on your Neo Geo system at home

01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:24.020
I've got I've actually got the Neo Geo with the slots open on it I just haven't

01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:30.880
found a machine with working MBS slots all of our slots are wide open you said

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:43.700
it not mean well isn't that special I think now is a good time for us to take

01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:46.860
a quick break and we're gonna come back and do the F use of the week we have to

01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:51.740
play that one promo one promo oh yes right we'll play that when we come back

01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:56.140
so if you want to send it in over private message right now the F use of

01:18:56.140 --> 01:19:00.520

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:06.060
To get to our chat room, just go to callebomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, then click on Chat.

01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:08.800
It's just that simple.

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:09.940
We'll take a quick break.

01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:15.760
We're going to start it off with something from 8 style.

01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:21.440
We're going to play some tack.

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:24.520
I only have the long mix of abstracts, is that cool?

01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:25.520
You want to hear A?

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:27.160
Okay, we're going to play some A songs.

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:36.160
We're gonna play abstract, the radical mix, and then we'll play A, and then we'll be right back with the FUs of the week, so send those over private message right now to me.

01:23:57.160 --> 01:24:02.160
...

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:07.160
...

01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:12.160
...

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:17.160
...

01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:22.160
...

01:26:52.160 --> 01:27:02.360
Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of

01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:04.640
the Orange Dance Baymara Music and More show?

01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:12.160
The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:14.380
It's unearthly.

01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:22.140
It's like being in a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:28.140
That sounds like a guy who must have been part of Heaven's Gate or something, talking about going to spaceships and shit.

01:27:28.140 --> 01:27:32.140
We're having fun opening Ramune.

01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:34.140
I don't have a...

01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:36.140
Ra-moo-nay.

01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:38.140
Ra-moo-nay.

01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:40.140
Ramune.

01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:42.140
Ramune.

01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:44.140
Even if there's a Ramune named Ramune.

01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:46.140
Rob's a hick.

01:27:46.140 --> 01:27:48.140
Honky.

01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:50.140
Okay.

01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:54.140
Alright kids, shall we do the FUs of the Week now?

01:27:54.140 --> 01:27:57.140
No, because Jamie has to go watch her guys.

01:27:57.140 --> 01:27:59.140
Dark Child 1 didn't know where that promo was from.

01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:02.140
That was that little clip where the guys talk about Dancing on Spaces.

01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:04.140
That's from a movie. Do you remember the name of the movie?

01:28:04.140 --> 01:28:08.140
Somebody entered it into some San Francisco film festival.

01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:14.140
It was in San Francisco. It was somewhere back east, like Rhode Island or some crap like that.

01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:15.140
Delaware, I don't know.

01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:22.140
Anyways, it was on the KOA site. Um, I don't know where it's at right now, but yeah.

01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:26.140
Okay, um...

01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:29.140
Alright.

01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:32.140
Okay. Are we ready for the interviews of the week now?

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:34.140
No, I heard... Okay, really quickly, this needs to be really quick.

01:28:34.140 --> 01:28:35.140
Sure. Sure.

01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:38.140
Um, oh, and, and watch, watch, watch the board.

01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:41.140
Hey! It's a board!

01:28:41.140 --> 01:28:48.980
I heard something about there was a rumor going around about karaoke karaoke revolution

01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:55.940
yeah that's also listed on EB's site if I'm not mistaken it was either on EB's site or

01:28:55.940 --> 01:29:04.920
the yeah so now there was that there was that E3 press release that came out a couple weeks

01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:09.300
ago that started all these rumors because it said Konami will have you dancing and playing

01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:15.420
outdoors and singing in 2003. And that kind of made people go, what does that mean? And

01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:18.300
as far as I thought, I figured that meant that they were probably just going to bring

01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:22.140
karaoke mode back into DDR. You remember in third mix, you'd have the lyrics on the screen?

01:29:22.140 --> 01:29:30.140
So you two could sit at home and go, oh, Nick, please, not so quick. You know I want it big.

01:29:30.140 --> 01:29:35.220
That would be cool to come back, though. And then I believe there was a DDR machine

01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:38.340
that also had karaoke in it, if I'm not mistaking.

01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:41.620
Akuma GM says something like that. Very rare. Yeah, they're very rare.

01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:45.140
But I think there was, there was a separate machine.

01:29:45.140 --> 01:29:48.620
But then there was also, wasn't there a standalone? Okay, you were thinking about that.

01:29:48.620 --> 01:29:52.340
I was thinking you were talking about the standalone karaoke game. Like the one they have at CyberZone?

01:29:52.340 --> 01:29:56.420
Should I go to CyberZone? No, I've never been to CyberZone.

01:29:56.420 --> 01:30:01.420
But you may have heard about it.

01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:05.020
Okay, like I like karaoke. You're pretending that I care about karaoke?

01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:07.020
I think you just don't admit it.

01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:12.020
I just think it'd be awesome for a segment, okay? That's all I'm saying.

01:30:12.020 --> 01:30:13.020
Blink.

01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:18.020
Karaoke is Japanese for tone deaf.

01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:24.020
Can we do the fuckies of the week now?

01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:25.020
Yeah.

01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:26.020
go.

01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:27.020
Okay.

01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:28.020
Here is justice.

01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:29.020
Here is punishment.

01:30:29.020 --> 01:30:30.020
Here is...

01:30:30.020 --> 01:30:31.020
Okay.

01:30:31.020 --> 01:30:49.780
My five year week goes toward onedollarhosting.com for having morons for techs who don't know

01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:54.780
I know that when I say moving to new server, that does mean moving to new host as well.

01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:57.780
If I say I'm moving to a server, you know what that means, right?

01:30:57.780 --> 01:31:00.780
Okay, everybody knows what moving to a new server means.

01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:02.780
Apparently the techs at One Dollar Hosting do not.

01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:06.780
So they're big morons built stupid heads.

01:31:06.780 --> 01:31:09.780
They're monkeys that fling poo at each other.

01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:12.780
Okay?

01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:13.780
And that's a lie.

01:31:13.780 --> 01:31:14.780
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:15.780
That's a lie too.

01:31:15.780 --> 01:31:17.780
It's not really one dollar because you have to pay a membership fee.

01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:24.780
paying one dollar a month.

01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:51.780
I'm done. My angst is somewhat worn off.

01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:24.740
on may 15th and not last friday and the fact that um um you suck

01:32:26.100 --> 01:32:30.740
yeah warner brothers they suck ass there's one more reason why i hated them but i can't remember

01:32:30.740 --> 01:32:37.460
what it is offhand yeah because they smell and um let's see there's also a big f-view for um

01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:47.460
Stupid people of Scandinavia, because that's so generic, and stupid spammers, and...

01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:49.460
Damn it, I...

01:32:49.460 --> 01:32:51.460
Bammers, you jackass!

01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:55.460
Spaniards, what fucking problem is...

01:32:55.460 --> 01:32:56.460
Ugh.

01:32:56.460 --> 01:32:58.460
Oh, let's see.

01:32:58.460 --> 01:33:05.460
Oh, oh, oh, and also to the core, because that movie sucked ass and should have never been made, and it was a waste of time for anyone that went there.

01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:07.460
In fact, that movie probably slurred your soul, so, um...

01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:08.460
Then why did you go?

01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:09.460
I didn't go.

01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:10.460
Oh.

01:33:10.460 --> 01:33:11.460
Hahahaha!

01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:12.460
Haha!

01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:17.460
Yes, I didn't go, but I can still base it on that.

01:33:17.460 --> 01:33:18.460
Um...

01:33:18.460 --> 01:33:23.460
Um, also a big eff you to New Line for releasing, uh, Kangaroo.

01:33:23.460 --> 01:33:24.460
Or, that stupid kangaroo.

01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:25.460
Kangaroo Jack.

01:33:25.460 --> 01:33:26.460
Captain Jack.

01:33:26.460 --> 01:33:30.460
See, now, that would be more entertaining if it was Captain Jack running around in the,

01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:32.460
you know, the Outback, and, you know, two or three people shooting at him.

01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:35.460
Well, if it was Captain Jack, there would have been a wet t-shirt contest in there.

01:34:02.460 --> 01:34:06.460
I want to go see the movie! Now!

01:34:06.460 --> 01:34:08.460
It will be there when you get back.

01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:10.460
E3 is not going to be there.

01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:12.460
It will be all over the internet.

01:34:12.460 --> 01:34:14.460
I don't want to see the movie opening day!

01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:15.460
You can see it down in L.A.

01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:17.460
I want to see it opening day! I already bought tickets!

01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:18.460
You can see it?

01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:21.460
Why would you want to go there opening day with all those stupid geeky guys dressed up like Neo?

01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:24.460
Because he is one of those geeky guys who dresses like Neo!

01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:28.460
I set that one up for you perfectly, Dara.

01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:30.460
You're welcome.

01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:32.460
The glasses and the trench coat still sue me.

01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:35.460
Did you see his dynamite rave routine at Scat?

01:34:35.460 --> 01:34:36.460
Did you see it?

01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:39.460
You have all two seconds of it.

01:34:39.460 --> 01:34:40.460
Yeah.

01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:42.460
I don't really have that much this week.

01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:46.460
I was pissed off during the week and then I just slowly cooled off.

01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:47.460
I hate that.

01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:50.460
See, fuck off shows will be awesome when we move because

01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:59.460
I'll be able to spout off my dislike for society on a daily basis.

01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:14.460
kostjamrh My f-view of the week goes out to Pokemon Ruby, because ever since I bought that game, I can't stop playing it, and I feel really immature. But you know what, it's fun.

01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:16.460
How many Pokemon are in that one?

01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:18.460
Like, about 200. It's a lot.

01:35:18.460 --> 01:35:20.460
Really quickly, this will only take a second.

01:35:20.460 --> 01:35:29.460
FU to the press, because they don't realize that all these Iraqi children that are killed in the street are probably from all the gunshots that people are firing in celebration of the fact that the regime is over.

01:35:29.460 --> 01:35:32.460
They don't realize that bullets go up and then they come down.

01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:34.460
Why are all my children dead? I do not know!

01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:41.460
so

01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:43.380
right

01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:47.380
I'm they fire off a gun and there's birds falling everywhere

01:35:47.380 --> 01:35:51.300
squirrels little Iraqis suicide bombing squirrels

01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:55.380
you know I came up with a good idea for your Pokemon thing is if like they had

01:35:55.380 --> 01:35:56.460
like a fighting game

01:35:56.460 --> 01:35:59.700
where the Pokemon actually had to fight each other. Pokemon stadium!

01:35:59.700 --> 01:36:03.220
no like to the death and like there would be three to

01:36:03.220 --> 01:36:10.220
There'd be like different, yes, there'd be like different classes. There'd be adults, and then little ones, and then some of them have their stages.

01:36:10.220 --> 01:36:20.220
Yeah, yeah, like, you know how you have like Pikachu becomes Rayachu, and that's all they have, but then there's ones where it's like Squirtle, and then I forget what he changes up to that, and then he becomes Blastoise?

01:36:20.220 --> 01:36:23.220
Yeah, Wartortle.

01:36:23.220 --> 01:36:31.220
Anyways, there's one more thing really quickly. They're releasing a live version of Battle Angel.

01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:36.220
Battle Angel. Remember the cybernetic chick that fights people and shit? A live action version.

01:36:36.220 --> 01:36:40.220
Are they basing it off of a comic? Yes. Because the comic strolled.

01:36:40.220 --> 01:36:47.220
Alright, I didn't really have any FUs of the Week outside of that, so I guess I'm done. Let's go around the room and hear from everyone else.

01:36:47.220 --> 01:36:50.220
Zero.

01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:54.620
Okay, I actually have a couple, not a whole lot, and this is the worst music to choose.

01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:55.520
What a feeling!

01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:57.920
Anyways, no, um, okay.

01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:00.420
One of them I realized at Arden Fair Mall.

01:37:00.420 --> 01:37:04.220
To the stupid bastards who can't wash their hands after they go to the bathroom.

01:37:04.220 --> 01:37:07.820
I don't want to touch the fucking door handle after you touched it.

01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:10.420
I don't want your lemon juice all over my hands.

01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:11.620
Um...

01:37:11.620 --> 01:37:13.420
After the stup-

01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:16.120
I don't give a shit what it is, it's fucking gross.

01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:18.820
And then, like...

01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:26.700
No, and then the next thing is, for the people who made those stupid hand dryers, make them

01:37:26.700 --> 01:37:30.860
warmer or something because make them actually fucking work.

01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:34.460
You're not reading the directions, it says rub your hands together.

01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:35.460
It works.

01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:36.460
Trust me.

01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:37.460
No, you know what those hand dryers are for?

01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:38.460
No, I know.

01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:39.460
You have those in the men's restroom.

01:37:39.460 --> 01:37:40.460
In the men's restroom.

01:37:40.460 --> 01:37:41.460
You want to know why?

01:37:41.460 --> 01:37:43.520
So they don't have to restock paper towels for us.

01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:44.520
Women have paper towels.

01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:47.660
They also have nice mirrors, nice toilets, everything's clean.

01:37:47.660 --> 01:37:54.660
is

01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:59.160
it's not like you're in in this one of the dumbest people in the universe

01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:03.080
and i water everywhere

01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:06.240
and like another f you don't go through the whole thing

01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:08.380
used to die quickly

01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:10.900
is it's gone way too long

01:38:10.900 --> 01:38:15.740
followed by uh... you have a stupid lately because that's not to and you do

01:38:15.740 --> 01:38:17.740
Yeah, bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

01:38:17.740 --> 01:38:21.740
Magic cards were cool, like, I don't know, ten years ago, or whenever they came out.

01:38:21.740 --> 01:38:23.740
And, um, exactly!

01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:25.740
It's not pretty, Hashi, the old cartoons!

01:38:25.740 --> 01:38:26.740
They weren't good, they-

01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:27.740
Oh, ooh!

01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:29.740
Oh, I mentioned this later. Never mind, that's alright, that's fine.

01:38:29.740 --> 01:38:32.740
Oh, one more thing, uh, F.U. the Konami for not releasing the VR stream,

01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:34.740
because I'm starting to get bored with the VR stream.

01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:36.740
I have another F.U.

01:38:36.740 --> 01:38:38.740
I'm getting bored.

01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:42.740
My other F.U. of the week goes toward not having money, because there's certain things that I need.

01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:46.740
I need a tablet, a graphics tablet for my computer.

01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:50.740
I need a light table to use for my art.

01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:53.740
I cannot find...

01:38:53.740 --> 01:38:56.740
Where do I get non-photo blue pencils?

01:38:56.740 --> 01:38:58.740
I need non-photo blue pencils.

01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:01.740
I know where you can get money for that stuff.

01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:04.740
Put it on a wish list.

01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:06.740
What?

01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:09.740
You should do what those people do on the internet, like the ones who say,

01:39:09.740 --> 01:39:14.500
my bills and people send them like five bucks just tell people help me help me

01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:19.540
make my comic help me help an aspiring you know comic art the thing is is that

01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:26.380
my comics gonna be all fucked up anyway hello I guess fucked up comic sell well

01:39:26.380 --> 01:39:29.200
that's the whole point I don't know would anyone in here buy it if I'd like

01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:34.840
published it I'd buy it because I like your I like your writings as it is you

01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:38.800
should make a comic of it well my other big fuck you goes toward not having a

01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:45.240
a proper drafting table and illumination because once I scan in all the stuff that I've drawn,

01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:50.160
I see all this crap that I missed because I don't have the proper light to do any of

01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:53.760
it. So yeah, fuck not having a drafting table with a built-in light.

01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:59.720
F you to not having money, okay? I have to get a fucking costume ready for the damn convention

01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:02.160
and I have no money. We're going thrift store shopping.

01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:05.760
I know, I found out the perfect idea for the number two is to-

01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:13.760
I figured it out. Actually, he helped me figure it out later. Anyways, I'm done with my F.U. because, just, fuck that.

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:19.760
No! Some of us other people have fuck-yous too.

01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:21.760
Okay, fuck you then.

01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:25.760
No, don't fuck both of us. Anyway.

01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:30.760
Okay, come on, continue. Is Anita up next? I'm sorry.

01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:33.760
Okay, alright, I'll go next. Um, mine's not very long.

01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:39.760
Okay, first of all, fuck you to Roosevelt Golf Land for getting rid of the Para-Para-Para machine.

01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:42.760
I'm highly disappointed, now I have to- Huh?

01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:48.760
Yeah, fuck them in general, but fuck them especially, most especially because they got rid of Para-Para-Para.

01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:51.760
Now I have to go very, very far away to play Para-Para-Para.

01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:54.760
You should get the PS2 version.

01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:59.760
I don't have room, but I could try.

01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:03.760
It's not the same.

01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:08.760
Hey, it's fine. You can be even stupider in your own house instead of out in the shade with a bunch of people.

01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:13.760
Okay. Well, this leads into my next Fuck You of the Week, which is

01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:18.760
Fuck You to Milpitas Golf Land, because they have

01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:25.260
Okay, just Disney Disney mix that stupid Disney DDR. I hate that game because

01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:29.020
Because you can't see the damn arrows and when you start messing up

01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:34.860
They start to flicker and you can't tell what the hell you're doing. Plus Milpitas has like big-ass fan in front of you

01:41:34.860 --> 01:41:40.500
So you feel like you're in a tornado while you're trying to play DDR. It really sucks. I can't breathe

01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:44.660
I can't see so I fail every time and also

01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:51.660
Oh, I had one more from Milpitas. I forgot what it was. Oh, what's that place we went

01:41:55.380 --> 01:42:01.020

01:42:01.020 --> 01:42:06.680
we're not having any bimani. Dave and Busters doesn't have any bimani? None. What? But they

01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:11.740

That will teach you the pirate software, little boy.

01:43:36.260 --> 01:43:39.260
You haven't come out for the PC yet.

01:43:39.260 --> 01:43:40.260
Yeah, you tell that.

01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:42.260
But there are, like, release betas out there.

01:43:42.260 --> 01:43:45.260
Ah, that's what you get for trying to get that.

01:43:45.260 --> 01:43:49.260
See, I had the same thing where I tried to get Lord of the Rings 2, and I got Sorority

01:43:49.260 --> 01:43:50.260
Boys.

01:43:50.260 --> 01:43:53.260
I got Sorority Boys all the goddamn time.

01:43:53.260 --> 01:43:55.260
Sorority Boys was, like, everywhere for a while.

01:43:55.260 --> 01:43:57.260
Like, any movie you downloaded was Sorority Boys.

01:43:57.260 --> 01:44:02.260
we're going to have an evil time once battle layout 2 is out

01:44:02.260 --> 01:44:06.260

some, it wasn't porn but it was like some kiddie game

01:44:11.260 --> 01:44:15.260
it was like Mavis Beacon 2003 or something

01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:18.260
as if, Mavis Beacon's the shit, I'm sorry

01:44:18.260 --> 01:44:19.260
as if it's a little

01:44:19.260 --> 01:44:21.260
that's how I learned to type

01:44:21.260 --> 01:44:25.260
I already know how to type, I learned how to type from playing on IRC

01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:26.260
on Mavis Beacon.

01:44:26.260 --> 01:44:27.260
Yeah!

You're gay, dude.

01:44:28.260 --> 01:44:37.820
If you didn't get that, Zero says Mavis Beacon is the city where the 50-pound black woman.

01:44:37.820 --> 01:44:38.820
Is she really?

01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:40.700
Mavis Beacon is the Oprah of computers.

01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:45.100
Oprah's not 250 pounds.

01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:46.100
She was.

01:44:46.100 --> 01:44:47.100
Maybe her breasts are.

01:44:47.100 --> 01:44:49.140
You know what's really, really, really scary?

01:44:49.140 --> 01:44:51.140
She's gonna be posing nude.

01:44:51.140 --> 01:44:52.140
No.

01:44:52.140 --> 01:44:53.140
No.

01:44:53.140 --> 01:44:54.140
Yes, serious.

01:44:54.140 --> 01:44:55.140

01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:40.820
that people lose personality when they lose weight they lose IQ too

01:45:40.820 --> 01:45:43.120
they turn into hoes and lose IQ

01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:46.460
let's get through the last two people FUs in here please

01:45:46.460 --> 01:45:49.040

01:45:49.040 --> 01:46:00.040
Fuck you, Anthony for kickin' my ass in Street Fighter II.

01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:03.040
That's the only fuck you I can think of because things have turned around.

01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:05.040
I can't really say fuck you to anything.

01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:07.040
I'm not pissed off anymore.

01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:10.040
Fuck you for me not being pissed off no more.

01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:12.040
Fuck all of you.

01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:18.040
Okay, uh, I have two fuck yous. One is to Zelda, the Wind Waker, okay?

01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:20.040
It's an awesome thing.

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:24.040
Or you don't need to fuck you for having Zelda. I don't even have it. I can't get it because they're out of stock everywhere, I guess.

01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:27.040
Fuck you for telling him to fuck off because he has Zelda.

01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:38.040
Yeah. Anyway, fuck you to Zelda, because the story was so incredibly cool. I won't spoil the ending for any of you, but if you play it, you'll know what I mean, I think.

01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:40.040
Link wins.

01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:43.200
link does not win

01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:46.800
like i said i'm not spoiling it for anybody

01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:51.440
so fuck you to zelda because you'll see what i mean when you play it

01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:53.240
yeah and the fact that link looks like a monster

01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:59.000
and especially fuck you to that little kid with the booger hanging out his nose on your home island

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.640
my second fuck you is fuck you to the world for not giving me anything to

01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:04.160

01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:08.040

01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:09.820
fuck you to this week

01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:15.820
Because it seems like everyone who normally has lots of fuck yous has lame fuck yous because they're too goddamn fucking happy.

01:47:16.820 --> 01:47:18.820
Yeah, Jamie's were cool, though.

01:47:18.820 --> 01:47:20.820
Alright, let's see what the chat room has to say.

01:47:20.820 --> 01:47:22.820

01:47:33.820 --> 01:47:46.820
That was more politically incorrect than anything Loki's ever said.

01:47:46.820 --> 01:47:48.820
Who said that fuck you?

01:47:48.820 --> 01:47:49.820

01:48:34.820 --> 01:48:38.180

01:48:42.660 --> 01:48:49.000

It was so bad in fact that I had to ponder using the I'm gay approach to get her the fuck away from me

01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:14.420
You know I just have to say this over air. What do you mean Jamie? You have a little bit of drool right side?

01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:17.560
It's gone

01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:19.920

01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:29.080

Wait, somebody needs free web space, try flatface.net.

01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:48.140
No, we don't need free web space, we actually need to be on our good space.

01:49:48.140 --> 01:49:50.780
Who needs free web space try my server in my friend's closet

01:49:54.260 --> 01:49:58.820

He won't talk to ladies. Is that what it was? I exed out of it already. I think it was

01:50:10.580 --> 01:50:18.540
This is going to be Jamie being a bitch, and please forgive me for being a bitch.

01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:19.540
Get over it!

01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:23.020
Just go out there and do it, and stop being sorry for yourself.

01:50:23.020 --> 01:50:24.020
Yeah, you know what?

01:50:24.020 --> 01:50:25.020
That brings me to a fuck you I can remember.

01:50:25.020 --> 01:50:26.020
I'm going to say it now.

01:50:26.020 --> 01:50:27.740
I'm going to just jump in on these chat room ones.

01:50:27.740 --> 01:50:28.740
Fuck you, Vaj.

01:50:28.740 --> 01:50:30.860
Vaj, come on, man!

01:50:30.860 --> 01:50:32.340
You had D.D.

01:50:32.340 --> 01:50:35.420
Archaholic go up and pimp a chick for you.

01:50:35.420 --> 01:50:36.980
Get some fucking balls, man!

01:50:36.980 --> 01:50:38.380
It's just a girl!

01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:39.540
Hey, hey, hey!

01:50:39.540 --> 01:50:43.540
best advice ever. If you want to talk to women, go to a fucking strip club because they're

01:50:43.540 --> 01:50:48.260
forced to come talk to you. They will carry on a conversation for long hours and you don't

01:50:48.260 --> 01:50:52.020
have to pay them shit. They'll just come talk to you and then after you get done with the

01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:56.540
conversation, they'll be like, do you want a lap desk? No. See, it's perfect. You only

01:50:56.540 --> 01:51:01.220
spend an initial $20 to get in, but talking to strippers is awesome and you'll just totally

01:51:01.220 --> 01:51:05.700
get over the whole fact that you're intimidated by women because they're really hot. Or you

01:51:05.700 --> 01:51:10.700
Maybe we can go to a hospital to ER where people are stuck there laying in their hospital beds and can't get away.

01:51:10.700 --> 01:51:15.700
Oh my god.

01:51:15.700 --> 01:51:20.700
It's because when you're talking to hot, retarded women, it's not very intimidating.

01:51:20.700 --> 01:51:25.700
When you're talking to hot, intelligent women, that's why I'm intimidated.

01:51:25.700 --> 01:51:30.700
You must be going the city limits, man, because fucking me, dude.

01:51:30.700 --> 01:51:37.700

01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:41.860

Also, fuck you to this thing, and he gives a couple flash things that I'm not gonna look at right now.

01:52:04.820 --> 01:52:10.320
Uh, fuck you to the people who made those for not giving out any warnings to people who have heart problems.

01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:14.920
I don't personally, but those could either A, kill fat people, or B, scare the holy living shit out of kids.

01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:17.620
Maybe some people, not even kids. I mean, those are just kind of fucked up.

01:52:17.620 --> 01:52:21.620
There's some fucked up flashes that I'm not looking at right now.

01:52:21.620 --> 01:52:24.920
Angel, I would like to say F you to whatever sickness everyone is getting,

01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:27.420
because I caught a bit of it too earlier in the week.

01:52:27.420 --> 01:52:30.520
F you to Magus being away, and yeah, I'm better now.

01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:33.520
By the way, I haven't gotten sick yet, just letting everyone know.

01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:12.520
The point is, it's not SARS because I know a lot of people who have gotten sick and they all got better within about three or four days.

01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:17.520
Fuck you for being way too serious. God damn, it was a fucking joke.

01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:24.520
Well, it's because my better half is very sick right now and it would suck if that was SARS, okay? It wouldn't be a funny laughing matter.

01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:29.520
Yeah, I should've done that. I haven't been to Hong Kong in a while, but I got better.

01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:56.520
Fuck, flat-faced on it, I have no idea.

01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:04.520
Okay, SkylineDC505 says, F you to hormones, nuff said.

01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:05.520
Mm-hmm.

01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:06.520
Indeed.

01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:11.520
Shadow would like to say, right now the only F you I have right now, uh, the...

01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:14.520
I hate not being able to find a nice, quiet place with my girlfriend.

01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:18.520
Fuck people for being around to nose around and spoil the mood.

01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:21.520
That's how you go to your house.

01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:40.640
vidpower would like to say FU to my computer for not booting up Windows XP correctly, FU

01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:44.000
to my monitor being all screwy whenever I turn on my computer, and FU to turning in

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:45.080
homework during Spring Break.

01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:50.080
All right, FUs are over, yay.

01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:55.800
Now would be an excellent time.

01:54:55.800 --> 01:55:04.880
I think now we're going to talk about the Orange Lounge cage match, yay.

01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:15.200
Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, quite a controversy breaks out over

01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:20.720
the song that won, which was a band called Freeze Pop, with a song called Science Genius

01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:24.280
Girl, and that was the song they did in frequency.

01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:26.280
And Zero and T.A.W.

01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:31.960
and S.H.I.V.E.M. got into it, and I made them hug when it was all over.

01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:34.080
Did you like that, Rob?

01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:39.160
turned me on little bit of man-on-man action I wrote in no I did not join in

01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:43.200
okay as for that whole little argument we got in we were actually talking in

01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:47.760
IRC and I admitted that yeah I do like some free spot song but I actually

01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:53.960

01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:06.080
For three songs, you can vote for the song that won last week or one of the two new songs.

01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:11.080
And this winning song goes into rotation on Orange Lounge Radio, Spelvani Museum, or forum.

01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:16.280
Alright, here we go, last week's winner, here's a clip, Freeze Pop, Science Genius Girl, here

01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:17.280
on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:24.280
The theorems stick to me, Microscope is in my hand

01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:29.280
Fun, fun, fun, sweet, fun, in the street

01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:35.280
When I call the human being, It will walk to all my hands

01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:43.280
When I call the human being, It will be a member of my band

01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:47.280
It will be a member of my band

01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:51.280
It will be a member of my band

01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:55.280
When I go to do my wishing

01:56:55.280 --> 01:56:58.280
Remember what my name is

01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:50.840
I'm sorry we were out just then we had dead air just there I had the stuff muted because

01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:53.840
people were talking over that last one you're gonna have to introduce the song again real

01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:54.840
Sorry about that.

01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:55.840
Okay.

01:57:55.840 --> 01:58:00.840
Let me run the title through one more time, because I need to give actually the name of

01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:01.840
the mix.

01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:03.840
It's M&M mixed by DJ Tripp.

01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:05.840
It's Without Me, Darktide, The Force mix.

01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:07.840
And where did you find this?

01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:12.840
Well, he brought the CD with it over to my house and I ripped it.

01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:18.840
DJ Tripp is one of my fiance's good friends, and he's a DJ in Santa Cruz.

01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:25.840
And apparently, it's just been played on a quad locally before, on the DJ David X show.

01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:30.840
And usually, we don't care for Eminem, but this is a remix.

01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:37.840
Alright, here we go. This is Eminem mixed by DJ Tripp with Without Me.

01:59:00.840 --> 01:59:05.840
Two thread-apart girls go round the outside, round the outside, round the outside

01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:10.840
Guess who's back?

01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:12.840
Back again

01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:14.840
Shave his back

01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:16.840
She'll look free

01:59:17.840 --> 01:59:18.840
Guess who's back?

01:59:19.840 --> 01:59:20.840
Guess who's back?

01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:22.840
Guess who's back?

01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:24.840
Guess who's back?

01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:38.920
I created a monster, cause nobody wants to see Marcel no more, they want Jadie, I'm

01:59:38.920 --> 01:59:39.920

01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:41.920
Well if you want Jadie, this is what I'll get ya.

01:59:41.920 --> 01:59:44.960
A little bit of weed, mixin' some hearts, they got some thoughts, da-da-da-dum, start

01:59:44.960 --> 01:59:48.440
my heart, quicker than the shots, when I get shocked at the hospital, while the doctor

01:59:48.440 --> 01:59:52.440
when they're not cooperating, when I'm rockin' at table, while he's operating.

01:59:52.440 --> 01:59:54.240
You waited too long to stop debating

01:59:54.240 --> 01:59:56.440
Cause I'm back, I'm on the brag, and I'm ovulating

01:59:56.440 --> 01:59:58.440
I know that you got a job, Miss Janie

01:59:58.440 --> 02:00:00.440
But your husband's heart problem's complicating

02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:02.440
So the FCC won't let me be

02:00:02.440 --> 02:00:04.440
Or let me be me, so let me see

02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:06.440
They try to shut me down on MTV

02:00:06.440 --> 02:00:09.440
But it feels so instant without me, so

02:00:09.440 --> 02:00:11.440
Come on, shit, I'm on your list

02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:12.440
Fuck that, come on your list

02:00:12.440 --> 02:00:14.440
Put someone to taste and get ready

02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:15.440
Cause this shit's about to get heavy

02:00:15.440 --> 02:00:16.440
I just settled on my lawsuit

02:00:16.440 --> 02:00:17.440
Fuck you, damn, yeah

02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:19.440
This looks like a job to me

02:00:19.440 --> 02:00:21.440
So everybody just follow me

02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:23.440
Just follow me, cause we need a little, cause of mercy

02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:25.440
Cause it feels so empty, without me

02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:27.440
I say, this looks like a job for me

02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:29.440
So everybody, just follow me

02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:31.440
Cause we need a little, cause of mercy

02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:33.440
Cause it feels so empty, without me

02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:35.440
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious

02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:37.440
Embarrassed, the parents still listen to Elvis

02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:39.440
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless

02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:41.440
Till someone comes along on a mission and yells BITCH!

02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:43.440
A visionary, vision is scary

02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:45.440
Can start a revolution, balloon the airwaves

02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:47.440
A rebel, but just let me revel in that

02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:49.440
And the fact that I got everyone

02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:52.440
And the fact that I got every one kiss I'm a dastard, it's a disaster

02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:55.440
Such a catastrophe, but you receive so damn much of my ass

02:00:55.440 --> 02:00:58.440
You ask for me, well I'm back, nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:00.440
Bitch, you better send it to me, nah nah nah nah nah nah

02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:02.440
I'm gonna enter in and out front of your skin like a splinter

02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:05.440
The center of attention, back for the winner, I'm in a resting

02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:07.440
The best thing since wrestling, investing

02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:10.440
In your kid's ears and nesting, testing and templates

02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:12.440
Still attention, soon as someone mentions me

02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:14.440
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free

02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:17.440
And who sent, who sent, you sent for me?

02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:49.940
You don't know me, it's too old, let's go, it's over

02:01:49.940 --> 02:01:52.440
Nobody listen to techno, no, let's go

02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:54.440
Just give me the signal, I'll be there with a hole

02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:56.440
It's still a new impulse, I've been don't

02:01:56.440 --> 02:02:00.440
Suspenseful with a pistol, ever since Prince sent himself into assembly

02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:04.440
But sometimes, as it just seems, everybody only wants to discuss me

02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:06.440
So this must mean I'm disgusting

02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:08.440
But it's just me, I'm just a scene

02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:10.440
So I'm not the first king of controversy

02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:12.440
I am the worst thing from hell, expressly

02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:14.940
To do black music, I'm self-evident

02:02:14.940 --> 02:02:17.680
Use it to get myself wealthy Hey!

02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:21.220
It's a concept that works 20 million of the white rappers emerged

02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:25.320
No matter how many fits in the sea It'd be so easy without me

02:02:25.340 --> 02:02:29.680
Now this looks like a job for me So everybody, just follow me

02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:33.820
Cause we need a little controversy Cause it feels so easy without me

02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:36.160
I said This looks like a job for me

02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:40.360
So everybody, just follow me Cause we need a little controversy

02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:42.460
Cause it's been so easy without me

02:02:42.460 --> 02:03:12.420
Alright, that was M&M Remix.

02:03:12.420 --> 02:03:16.240
by DJ Tripp, a song called Without Me. Now we go around the room and see what everyone

02:03:16.240 --> 02:03:17.240
Some thoughts, Jamie?

02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:25.240
I personally, I mean, I more or less really like it, just because he's a cool guy, you

02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:26.240
know, fan friend.

02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:33.240
Um, that, I look at the overall presentation, because if you think about it, a lot of what,

02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:37.240
you know, rap that you hear nowadays is just, you know, more of the same specific surface.

02:03:37.240 --> 02:03:43.240
I think it's kind of neat to hear it done a little differently, and I like how it flows

02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:44.240
together.

02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:49.240
You know, I give it a 9 per play.

02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:51.240
Alright, 0.

02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:57.240
Actually, I am really not an M&M fan at all.

02:03:57.240 --> 02:04:00.240
Everybody who knows me knows I absolutely hate them.

02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:07.240
But I've actually seen DJ Trip one time in Underground and I thought it was really good and everything only gets better from this song.

02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:13.240
On this song, based alone, I give it an 8 because it was done pretty well.

02:04:13.240 --> 02:04:15.240
Moving on, Loki.

02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:48.240
Even some of the most simplest stuff works, but I'm going to have to give it like a 7.

02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:52.240
Did you get a Holocaust?

02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:59.240
Hey, yeah. I'm going to give it like a pretty decent score. It sounded really cool.

02:04:59.240 --> 02:05:05.240
Put together well, as far as I can tell, but I really don't know that much about putting those things together.

02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:10.240
But if Lucky says it wasn't that difficult at all, I believe that too.

02:05:10.240 --> 02:05:15.680
What I really like about it is that it put visions in my head of Darth Vader doing hip-hop

02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:22.680
dancing with the Stormtroopers behind him, and titled like DJ Vader, and then the big

02:05:23.120 --> 02:05:28.360
titty girls in the back with the Princess Leia hair going, oh yeah baby, DJ Vader, Hoochie

02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:35.360
Mama Girls, and the Stormtroopers featuring DJ Jazzy, Emperor, Jeff, and all that kind

02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:41.360
and you know all that kind of stuff. And then the octopus headed race doing it. I haven't

02:05:41.360 --> 02:05:48.120
seen the part two yet. But um. Blue nose guy. The guy with the blue nose plan descended

02:05:48.120 --> 02:05:54.960
doing scratching in the background. Oh the band from Jabba the Hutt or yeah. Yeah the

02:05:54.960 --> 02:06:01.960
blue nose guy. He looked like an elephant thing. Yeah so you know it could have maybe

02:06:01.960 --> 02:06:05.960
I've maybe done a little bit more with it, added some stuff to it, but it was pretty neat, I liked it.

02:06:05.960 --> 02:06:07.960
Call it an 8. Give it an 8.

02:06:35.960 --> 02:06:36.840
overall

02:06:36.840 --> 02:06:38.380
that you want to make a right

02:06:38.380 --> 02:06:41.960
yes it's wrong to make a right yes

02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:47.780
three let's do

02:06:47.780 --> 02:06:49.080
all right

02:06:49.080 --> 02:06:53.040
three left that's what we have to say on eminem mixed by d j trip without me now

02:06:53.040 --> 02:06:55.760
loki what we hear last

02:06:55.760 --> 02:06:57.400
today here's song by

02:06:57.400 --> 02:06:59.960
group called haven't heard

02:06:59.960 --> 02:07:02.780
i was introduced to the song by uh...

02:07:02.780 --> 02:07:05.120
our friend eric tonight

02:07:05.120 --> 02:07:09.320
And it's called Duck Toy, and you'll see why.

02:07:09.320 --> 02:07:10.720
I'm very scared, but here it is.

02:07:10.720 --> 02:07:12.800
This is Hampenberg with Duck Toy.

02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:19.800
Enjoy!

02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:19.800
Oh you bastard I want it, I want it

02:09:19.800 --> 02:09:26.800
I need it, I need it Oh yeah, yeah

02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:34.800
I want it, I want it I need it, I need it

02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:38.800
Oh yeah, yeah

02:09:38.800 --> 02:09:40.800
I want it

02:10:38.800 --> 02:10:57.440
It gave me a headache, I mean it was cool, it was really neat, but it gave me a headache.

02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:03.560
And then it was like, when that woman started talking and making moaning noises, my response

02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:11.560
This was Meanwhile in another song, so yeah, it gets a 7, but it still gave me a headache.

02:11:11.560 --> 02:11:12.560
Hi.

02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:17.560
Zero.

02:11:17.560 --> 02:11:31.560
Okay, as we all stare at the bondage for it, I don't know, okay, the beginning of that song sounded like a bad bowel movement, and then it moved into making me laugh my ass off once the rubber ducky started going.

02:11:31.560 --> 02:11:38.560
And then all of a sudden it just switched songs and started going into a chick, starting off with something that sounded like, you bastard.

02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:48.560
Um, altogether, that song really confused me and it might as well have had the smell of the sound it started with. I would give it like, a pour.

02:11:48.560 --> 02:12:04.560
It was hilarious. The first time I listened to it, it was hilarious. I don't know where that shit came from, but I think that was an edit for the same song, and I think it's longer, and I think it starts out with the chick, and then it goes into the duck, and so that would make more sense.

02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:10.560
But if it is funny, and I was just thinking when I heard it, I was like, what an ingenious idea.

02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:16.560
I wonder who was out there thinking, I wonder if I can make a song with this duck.

02:12:16.560 --> 02:12:22.560
I'll make a techno song with this rubber ducky. I mean, it's just, it was funny.

02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:24.560
DDRholic?

02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:28.560
I thought it was really funny too. That's a killer, killer duck.

02:12:28.560 --> 02:12:34.560
What kind of people was really a duck? It sounds like a dog toy to me, but it could be a dog toy, duck, whatever.

02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:42.560
The thing, I don't understand the girl thing either, but it's genius what they did with the duck.

02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:53.560
It's genius the way it mixed, it raps, it did, you know, it's scratching, and it sounded like it had an orgasm too, but that's okay.

02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:56.560
So I don't know, it's pretty good, I'll give it an eight.

02:12:56.560 --> 02:13:02.560
That song brought to mind erotic imagery of Bert and Ernie, and for that it gets a 6.9.

02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:06.560
6.9? What does that mean?

02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:08.560
Alright.

02:13:08.560 --> 02:13:11.560
That means it's gettin' some.

02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:15.560
You can send in your votes now, and here are the three songs you can vote for in tonight's cage match.

02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:18.560
Last week's winner, Freeze Pop, was Science Genius Girl.

02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:25.560
I want to roll my hands, when I call my name.

02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:39.560
This is Eminem mixed by DJ Tripp with Without Me.

02:13:39.560 --> 02:13:50.560
And Hamburg with Duct Toy.

02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:55.300

02:13:55.300 --> 02:13:57.740

02:14:02.500 --> 02:14:07.100

and they're not voting

02:14:10.700 --> 02:14:15.060
you'd be damn glad i was gonna play the Kyle Snyder song again okay

02:14:15.060 --> 02:14:17.500
that's right you know what i said last week

02:14:17.500 --> 02:14:20.920
if i didn't if i i wasn't planning on winning that last week i don't think i

02:14:20.920 --> 02:14:22.220
was going to win with that

02:14:22.220 --> 02:14:24.940
and i said i was going to play the house and i don't know i a m

02:14:24.940 --> 02:14:26.700
to vote

02:14:26.700 --> 02:14:28.860
or i will be angry with you

02:14:28.860 --> 02:14:30.780
uh...

02:14:30.780 --> 02:14:34.520
and you don't want me to be angry with you

02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:35.820
uh... right

02:14:35.820 --> 02:14:37.300
uh...

02:14:37.300 --> 02:14:40.300
we're going to take well i don't i don't really want to take a break so we need

02:14:40.300 --> 02:14:42.780
to talk about something else uh... what's that was a

02:14:42.780 --> 02:14:43.820
Can I break something?

02:14:43.820 --> 02:14:45.460
Okay.

02:14:45.460 --> 02:14:48.140
I don't have anything to break. I can't break the bottle lid again.

02:14:48.140 --> 02:14:50.860
Zero, do you want to talk about video games? Do you have a review you want to give us?

02:14:50.860 --> 02:14:57.020
Oh, okay. I can try to throw something together here. I wasn't fully prepared, but

02:14:57.020 --> 02:15:01.940
Kingdom Hearts 2 does actually sound decent. I can't wait to at least see like a

02:15:01.940 --> 02:15:05.660
good demo of it.

02:15:05.660 --> 02:15:07.140
Oh, finished Kingdom Hearts?

02:15:07.140 --> 02:15:10.780
Okay, I'm almost done. I just beat Agrabah, but I've been playing the getaway lately,

02:15:10.780 --> 02:15:15.780
Which is on my review list, even though it's not really a new game.

02:15:15.780 --> 02:15:20.780
I don't know, the gameplay of that game is cool, it's kind of sketchy sometimes.

02:15:20.780 --> 02:15:26.780
All the model of the character models is really good, until they start moving.

02:15:26.780 --> 02:15:31.780
When they start moving, it looks like a bad epileptic seizure or something.

02:15:31.780 --> 02:15:39.780
Sometimes it's really smooth, and the other times they start doing the whole classic PS1 movies where it's all really blocky and jittery.

02:15:39.780 --> 02:15:46.780
The gameplay is good, the story is good, involving, nor have I ever heard a game use the word fuck so many times in ten minutes.

02:15:46.780 --> 02:15:52.780
And so it's fucking this, fucking this, fucking that, and it's all in an English accent, so either way you'll get to laugh pretty well.

02:15:52.780 --> 02:15:55.780
Yeah, they get away.

02:15:55.780 --> 02:16:03.780
Some of the mission objectives are kind of hard to understand, but you can't understand what the fuck they're telling you to do.

02:16:03.780 --> 02:16:06.780
It's because you're not speaking English English.

02:16:06.780 --> 02:16:14.780
I talked to my friend in the UK and they said, and I was talking to him and he's all, I can't understand you so I want you to speak English, I said I am, you're not.

02:16:14.780 --> 02:16:23.780
Anyways, another game is, oh yeah, a big one right now, Auto Modelista. I have a couple, did you just say Auto Molesta?

02:16:23.780 --> 02:16:29.780
That's basically what, basically that's what Auto Modelista does to your wallet.

02:16:29.780 --> 02:16:52.780
Basically, you pay $50 for a game that looks really good, but the game is basically nothing but drifting. You get a 3000GT, which is supposed to have one of the best handling capabilities ever, and it's a constant drift. You touch the joystick and your car goes into a spin. It's kind of pointless.

02:16:52.780 --> 02:16:57.780
That means to be good at it, you don't play it.

02:17:22.780 --> 02:17:27.720
It's kind of a hit-or-miss thing after the Xbox. I really don't have anything up my sleeve right now

02:17:27.720 --> 02:17:29.720
I haven't had a chance to play anything

02:17:30.140 --> 02:17:33.220
But Oh save up $200 get steel battalion

02:17:34.340 --> 02:17:36.340
$200 mine just played at your house

02:17:37.660 --> 02:17:40.220
Steel battalion will make anyone feel manly

02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:45.860
When you sit in front of this gigantic controller, it makes you feel like you have the world's biggest penis

02:17:45.860 --> 02:17:50.860
As Brad comes in and demonstrates!

02:18:15.860 --> 02:18:30.860
Let's see. Metroid Prime, still play it, even if you haven't. That's about it for right now until I start playing more. Now that I have a job, I'll be able to actually play more games, but I've got to go over to your house and play games at your house because you have a bunch.

02:18:30.860 --> 02:18:36.860
And then more of you need to play Phantasy Star Online with me and Rob.

02:18:36.860 --> 02:18:40.860
Yes, and I need to get my broadband adapter thing back.

02:18:40.860 --> 02:18:45.860
And I'll be able to play it as Rob's character when we move in.

02:18:45.860 --> 02:18:50.860
Yeah, you can put up to four characters on one card.

02:18:50.860 --> 02:18:55.860
My character for Phantasy Star Online looks like she's twelve and has these big pink pigtails.

02:18:55.860 --> 02:19:00.860
Well, bless you.

02:19:00.860 --> 02:19:05.860
I thought you were going to say big pink boobs, sorry.

02:19:05.860 --> 02:19:17.860
Next week I have a few games that I'm going to get a hold of and play and see what they do, so next week we do it again. I'm going to have a lot better of a review.

02:19:17.860 --> 02:19:19.860
still play clock tower 3

02:19:47.860 --> 02:19:52.860
Every movie where they have dolls, they're always the biggest killers.

02:19:53.860 --> 02:19:57.860
So, yeah, I can't wait. I'm going to have a doll.

02:19:58.860 --> 02:20:01.860
It's going to be the Loki doll. It's going to be a monkey.

02:20:02.860 --> 02:20:04.860
They're like, monkey, kill him.

02:20:05.860 --> 02:20:16.860
Once again, I'd like to remind our listeners that probably in about a month or so, we're going to be running a battle royale tabletop style game over IRC.

02:20:16.860 --> 02:20:23.860
We'll have stats, we'll have the details published somewhere soon, possibly on DarkSakura.com.

02:20:23.860 --> 02:20:26.860
You still have to teach me how to play so I can join in?

02:20:26.860 --> 02:20:29.860
Everyone will have to learn how to play, we're making up the rules.

02:20:29.860 --> 02:20:30.860
Okay, good, then you'll have to teach me.

02:20:30.860 --> 02:20:31.860
I win!

02:20:31.860 --> 02:20:32.860
No, you don't win.

02:20:32.860 --> 02:20:37.860
I will go ahead and reveal a couple of little tiny things that aren't major secrets.

02:20:37.860 --> 02:20:38.860
Can I be the guy?

02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:41.860
You know the guy that does the thing?

02:20:41.860 --> 02:20:49.860
We will be allowed to have a proficiency, but some proficiencies will be assigned, and one of the proficiencies is lucky bitch power.

02:20:49.860 --> 02:20:57.860
Yeah, and Darkchild and I will actually be playing a lot of games this week. He's kind of like the other guy behind my reviews and such.

02:20:57.860 --> 02:21:02.860
So, this week we'll try to at least get eight games and try to run them and see what happens.

02:21:02.860 --> 02:21:05.860
And that's all I got right now, but next week will be better.

02:21:05.860 --> 02:21:12.860
I have a review for Dracula X for the PC Engine Duo. Best game ever. Go save up the $300 and buy it.

02:21:12.860 --> 02:21:18.860
I have a review for E.T. for the $2600. Best game ever.

02:21:18.860 --> 02:21:25.860
I have a five word review for that. Actually, no, an eight word review. Ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass.

02:21:25.860 --> 02:21:29.860
Oh, Jimmy likes the ass.

02:21:29.860 --> 02:21:32.860
I have two words for you. Attack.

02:21:32.860 --> 02:21:37.860
Wait, for the new ET coming out, the best part is, it's not out.

02:21:37.860 --> 02:21:39.860
But it will be.

02:21:39.860 --> 02:21:44.860
The best part will be when you don't turn on your console to play it.

02:21:44.860 --> 02:21:47.860
Okay, I think now's a good time to take a break.

02:21:47.860 --> 02:21:50.860
Yeah.

02:21:50.860 --> 02:21:57.860
Alright, this break, since the last break we did all these songs that start with A,

02:21:57.860 --> 02:22:01.860
I thought it would be only appropriate to do songs that start with X, Y, and Z.

02:22:01.860 --> 02:22:08.860
all sex. So here we go, we'll be right back.

02:23:01.860 --> 02:23:03.860
Yeah

02:27:03.860 --> 02:27:09.140
Alright, we're setting up now for Orange Lounge match game we're going to play tonight, but

02:27:09.140 --> 02:27:12.300
we have to jot down some questions really fast and get all the celebrities prepped,

02:27:12.300 --> 02:27:16.620
and we have to get some contestants, so the contestants that will be playing match game

02:27:16.620 --> 02:27:21.020
tonight will be the first two folks in the chat room who can answer me this question.

02:27:21.020 --> 02:27:25.820
Alright, Jamie's going to get good because I don't.

02:27:25.820 --> 02:27:27.380
What is Jamie's favorite shooting game?

02:27:27.380 --> 02:27:29.780
Will people be able to get that though?

02:27:29.780 --> 02:27:32.500
Yeah, that's because I've said it a bajillion times.

02:27:32.500 --> 02:27:33.500
What's your question?

02:27:33.500 --> 02:27:39.500
Who's the artist that did Dead End, and the actual artist, not Naoki?

02:27:39.500 --> 02:27:42.140
So you have to answer both those questions.

02:27:42.140 --> 02:27:44.660
A, who is the artist that did Deadline?

02:27:44.660 --> 02:27:45.620
No, not Deadline.

02:27:45.620 --> 02:27:46.120
I'm sorry.

02:27:46.120 --> 02:27:46.900
Dead End.

02:27:46.900 --> 02:27:48.220
Dead End, OK.

02:27:48.220 --> 02:27:51.180
A, who is the artist that did Dead End, not Deadline?

02:27:51.180 --> 02:27:55.380
That's question A. And B, what is Jamie's favorite shooter?

02:27:55.380 --> 02:27:57.300
She said it a million times on the show.

02:27:57.300 --> 02:28:00.140
We don't have anyone that gets A and B right.

02:28:00.140 --> 02:28:02.700
I think A's a little easier, so we'll use A as the answer

02:28:02.700 --> 02:28:04.600
than B as a tiebreaker.

02:28:04.600 --> 02:28:05.560
so

02:28:05.560 --> 02:28:11.480
uh... jamie's favorite shooter and the artist of the dead end

02:28:11.480 --> 02:28:15.560
and uh... in the meantime we're gonna play a nice little song to uh... prep us

02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:17.440
all for match game

02:28:17.440 --> 02:28:20.120
uh... and that's all will be

02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:23.920
doctor bomb a because this show needs help and i think this is also an inside

02:28:23.920 --> 02:28:27.600
joke with jamie american right now at least i pick up on that

02:28:27.600 --> 02:28:30.480
it has nothing to do it but i mean that the name of the song if you say it is a

02:28:30.480 --> 02:28:32.760
word does

02:28:32.760 --> 02:28:39.760
little bit of dual meaning

02:29:02.760 --> 02:29:04.760
I'm an indie anime

02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:08.260
I used to walk around with the space in my hand

02:29:08.260 --> 02:29:11.760
Dr. Pompei is my name and my father has the same

02:29:11.760 --> 02:29:15.260
But everything it changed here in Tigerland

02:29:15.260 --> 02:29:18.760
It's always that Tiger took my father

02:29:18.760 --> 02:29:22.260
It's always that Tiger took my brother

02:29:22.260 --> 02:29:25.760
It's always that Tiger took my mother

02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:29.760
It's always that Tiger took my family

02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:49.760
I lived with my family and friends in one house But now they all are gone, and life is not so fun But what can you expect here in Tangerland?

02:29:49.760 --> 02:30:03.760
It's so wet, that I just took my father

02:30:03.760 --> 02:30:20.760
One day in the warm jungle, a tiger took my stake

02:30:20.760 --> 02:30:23.760
It wasn't really fun, it was a big mistake

02:30:23.760 --> 02:30:27.760
I took my brother's screenshot and chucked the tiger down

02:30:27.760 --> 02:30:30.760
This is how we do it here in Tigerland

02:31:30.760 --> 02:31:55.760
It's so wet, the tiger took my family

02:32:00.760 --> 02:32:10.760
Orange Lounge Radio. If we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

02:32:10.760 --> 02:32:25.760
Alright, we are back and let's get to the winner of the match, or not the match game, we don't know that yet, but the winner of the cage match tonight,

02:32:25.760 --> 02:32:32.760
SAD BUT TRUE, YOU VOTED DUCK TOY AS THE WINNER OF TONIGHT'S CAGE MATCH.

02:32:33.760 --> 02:32:40.760
Oh boy. Want us to say that again?

02:32:41.760 --> 02:32:47.760
That sounds like some strange Vietnamese soup. DUCK TOY! I WANT DUCK TOY!

02:32:47.760 --> 02:32:51.760
That's okay, because I can bring the other Freeze Pop song next week.

02:32:51.760 --> 02:32:55.760
Alright.

02:32:55.760 --> 02:32:59.760
Okay, so now let's talk about contestants for Match Game.

02:32:59.760 --> 02:33:03.760
Nobody got both questions right.

02:33:03.760 --> 02:33:07.760
Right, but we have people that got one right, and we have people that got the other one right.

02:33:07.760 --> 02:33:11.760
But nobody got them both right. So, first off, the person who got

02:33:11.760 --> 02:33:15.760
Jamie's favorite shooter question correct, Jamie. What's the favorite suitor?

02:33:15.760 --> 02:33:25.760
First of all, for you people who try to name Doom and Hexen, those are first-person shooters.

02:33:25.760 --> 02:33:26.760
Those are not shooting games.

02:33:26.760 --> 02:33:27.760
Those are first-person shooters.

02:33:27.760 --> 02:33:28.760
There's a difference.

02:33:28.760 --> 02:33:35.160
A shooter is like Gradius or Parodius or Radiant Silver Gun.

02:33:35.160 --> 02:33:36.160
And R-Type.

02:33:36.160 --> 02:33:37.160
R-Type's awesome.

02:33:37.160 --> 02:33:42.160
But Radiant Silver Gun is my favorite shooting game, followed closely by Osha Berry Parodius.

02:33:42.160 --> 02:33:45.880
So Dark Tetsuya was the only one to name Radiant Silver Gun as Jamie's favorite shooter, so

02:33:45.880 --> 02:33:47.400
he's in by default.

02:33:47.400 --> 02:33:49.480
So we have Dark Tetsuya versus...

02:33:49.480 --> 02:33:52.960
Nah, we decided to eliminate all the people that put Hexen in Doom, because that was a

02:33:52.960 --> 02:33:55.980
pretty good amount of people.

02:33:55.980 --> 02:34:04.520
And we were left with somebody who said Gradius, which is kind of like Proteus, but, oh well,

02:34:04.520 --> 02:34:09.360
you win by default, so Justin's Circuit is contestant number two.

02:34:09.360 --> 02:34:11.120
A lot of people got NNS.

02:34:11.120 --> 02:34:14.380
I was talking to all the people who, a lot of people got NNS.

02:34:14.380 --> 02:34:17.540
What's funny is Dark Tetsuya, that's the one question he didn't get.

02:34:17.540 --> 02:34:18.820
But he got the Radiant Silvergon one.

02:34:18.820 --> 02:34:22.860
So we got one person that got in one, and one person that got in the other.

02:34:22.860 --> 02:34:25.660
So we have Dark Tetsuya versus Justin Circuit.

02:34:25.660 --> 02:34:26.660
Yay!

02:34:26.660 --> 02:34:27.660
No, the blue wire!

02:34:27.660 --> 02:34:29.660
The blue wire!

02:34:29.660 --> 02:34:33.820
Anyway, I'm still trying to come up with questions as we're going here, so actually you guys,

02:34:33.820 --> 02:34:35.780
I am not going to participate in Match Game tonight.

02:34:35.780 --> 02:34:37.460
I'm going to write the questions.

02:34:37.460 --> 02:34:43.380
But we do have our other lovely celebrities, and they are.

02:34:43.380 --> 02:34:48.100
Let's go around and say hello to our fabulous celebrities.

02:34:48.100 --> 02:34:56.320
Celebrity number one, tell us who you are.

02:34:56.320 --> 02:35:05.100
And what are you here to plug this week?

02:35:05.100 --> 02:35:07.920
Contestant number two, say hello.

02:35:07.920 --> 02:35:08.920
Your mom.

02:35:08.920 --> 02:35:10.880
And what are you here to plug this week?

02:35:10.880 --> 02:35:11.880
Likes cheese.

02:35:11.880 --> 02:35:15.960
All right, contestant number three, what is your name?

02:35:15.960 --> 02:35:16.960
Hello.

02:35:16.960 --> 02:35:18.840
And what are you here to plug this week?

02:35:18.840 --> 02:35:20.560
Iraqi Suicide Baby.

02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:21.560
Fun.

02:35:21.560 --> 02:35:23.920
Contestant number four, say hello.

02:35:23.920 --> 02:35:25.920
Hi Rob, how are you?

02:35:25.920 --> 02:35:26.920
What's your name?

02:35:26.920 --> 02:35:27.920
Kyle Schneider.

02:35:27.920 --> 02:35:34.920
And what are you here to plug this week?

02:35:34.920 --> 02:35:38.920
Um, cute cell phone danglies.

02:35:38.920 --> 02:35:41.920
Alright, contestant number five, say hello.

02:35:41.920 --> 02:35:42.920
I...

02:35:42.920 --> 02:35:44.920
Actually, you're not a contestant, you're a celebrity. Celebrity number five, say hello.

02:35:44.920 --> 02:35:48.920
I have a penis.

02:35:48.920 --> 02:35:50.920
And what are you here to plug this week?

02:35:50.920 --> 02:35:55.920
Would you like to have sex with B?

02:35:55.920 --> 02:35:58.920
I have to actually think about that, it's been that long.

02:35:58.920 --> 02:36:00.920
Alright, celebrity number six.

02:36:00.920 --> 02:36:03.920
Oh, you're not participating. Okay, so we only have five celebrities.

02:36:03.920 --> 02:36:13.920
The actual match game had 5 celebrities, and we do too now tonight.

02:36:33.920 --> 02:36:40.920
Question, Norman the newbie was so nude at DDR, but all the regulars were really getting

02:36:49.280 --> 02:36:53.620
fed up with his antics and wished he would really stop doing the blank every time he

02:36:53.620 --> 02:37:08.380
played. Norman the newbie was so new to DDR but all the regulars were really

02:37:08.380 --> 02:37:12.520
getting fed up with his antics and wish he would really stop doing the blank

02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:19.520
every time he played

02:37:42.520 --> 02:38:07.040
I don't remember what this song is, but there's a video done to Golden Boy where they have

02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:09.040
I've heard the jiggling done in time with the music.

02:38:09.040 --> 02:38:12.040
Okay, are all the celebrities in?

02:38:12.040 --> 02:38:13.040
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:22.040
Everybody in? Everybody in?

02:38:22.040 --> 02:38:25.040
Alright, contestants first or celebrities first?

02:38:26.040 --> 02:38:27.040
Contestants first.

02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:28.040
Contestants first.

02:38:28.040 --> 02:38:30.040
Okay, here we go.

02:38:30.040 --> 02:38:37.360
dark Tetsuya says Norman the newbie was so new to DDR but all the

02:38:37.360 --> 02:38:39.920
regulars were getting really fed up with his antics and really wish he would stop

02:38:39.920 --> 02:38:49.480
doing the caution drop every time he played. Justin says Norman the newbie he

02:38:49.480 --> 02:38:53.560
was really sick that Norman newbie would and wish Norman the newbie would stop

02:38:53.560 --> 02:38:58.560
doing the pelvic thrust every time he played.

02:38:58.560 --> 02:39:01.560
Alright. Jamie, what did you say?

02:39:01.560 --> 02:39:02.560
The truffle shuffle.

02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:09.560
The truffle shuffle!

02:39:09.560 --> 02:39:10.560
Zero.

02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:15.560
I said that he would quit head banging to Daiken Kai.

02:39:15.560 --> 02:39:18.560
I'm tired of all seeing those damn bastards sit there while they're playing Daiken Kai

02:39:18.560 --> 02:39:19.560
on Easygon.

02:39:19.560 --> 02:39:21.560
They look like fucking morons.

02:39:21.560 --> 02:39:22.560
morons

02:39:22.560 --> 02:39:23.920
okay radio by the way

02:39:23.920 --> 02:39:26.600
yes i'm sorry i was stamping in place and

02:39:26.600 --> 02:39:29.560
putting the little metal symbol up in the air and

02:39:29.560 --> 02:39:30.720
bang it had been

02:39:30.720 --> 02:39:35.720
it's the stupidest thing in the world and knock it off

02:39:35.720 --> 02:39:38.480
bogey

02:39:38.480 --> 02:39:42.760
uh... i said that he would stop seeing with the music basically actually not

02:39:42.760 --> 02:39:46.200
really see making noise music like uh...

02:39:46.200 --> 02:39:52.040
known for the whistle song and clapping at odd times because you know newbies, they don't

02:39:52.040 --> 02:39:57.040
have rhythm in the first place so they can't keep up with the song. They're all like whoo

02:39:57.040 --> 02:40:04.040
whoo, oh. Yeah, it's like that. All right, Anita. Norman the newbie needs to stop doing.

02:40:04.040 --> 02:40:06.040
Oh, I don't want to say mine.

02:40:06.040 --> 02:40:10.040
Norman the Newbie needs to stop doing the watermelon crawl.

02:40:10.040 --> 02:40:13.040
I know. I know it's sad.

02:40:13.040 --> 02:40:18.040
That's fabulous.

02:40:18.040 --> 02:40:24.040
Darkchild, I really wish Norman the Newbie would stop doing the coin slot.

02:40:24.040 --> 02:40:27.040
It won't fit.

02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:28.040
Oh, God.

02:40:28.040 --> 02:40:28.540
I know.

02:40:28.540 --> 02:40:30.080
You know, you might be small enough.

02:40:30.080 --> 02:40:31.840
You might not have a problem with that.

02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:38.640
In-house speakers are down.

02:40:38.640 --> 02:40:39.120
All right.

02:40:42.120 --> 02:40:42.680
OK.

02:40:42.680 --> 02:40:43.200
So.

02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:44.120
You're rapping cool.

02:40:47.640 --> 02:40:50.520
Here we go, next question.

02:40:50.520 --> 02:40:53.520
It's all tied up at 0-0, everybody.

02:40:53.520 --> 02:40:54.840
Let's get to the next question.

02:40:54.840 --> 02:40:57.320
You were close to my ass, you said.

02:40:57.320 --> 02:41:04.320
not close enough. Alright, next question, here we go. Zero, intern Zero, was so happy

02:41:05.160 --> 02:41:12.160
when he got his first extra stage on DDR Extreme that he blanked all over the machine. Zero

02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:20.740
was so happy when he got his first extra stage on DDR Extreme that he blanked all over the

02:41:20.740 --> 02:41:42.860
machine.

02:41:42.860 --> 02:41:49.300
He was so happy when he got his extra stage the first time that he pranked all over the

02:41:49.300 --> 02:41:54.300
kostjamrh Are all of the celebrities in?

02:41:54.300 --> 02:41:59.300
kostjamrh Come on, you live with them, Anita

02:41:59.300 --> 02:42:10.900
p0k3smot42o

02:42:10.900 --> 02:42:20.900
p0k3smot42o

02:42:20.900 --> 02:42:27.900
0 was so happy when he got extra stage on ddr extreme for the first time that he spit

02:42:37.940 --> 02:42:44.940
propel all over the machine. Justin Circuit said 0 was so happy when he got his extra

02:42:44.940 --> 02:42:53.940
I was so happy when he got his extra stage on DDR Extreme for the first time that he blew up all over the machine.

02:42:53.940 --> 02:42:58.940
Alright, I know that could have a lot of reference. I think he's trying to go for a gimme.

02:42:58.940 --> 02:43:08.940
Jamie, he was so happy he had a violent bowel movement all over the DDR machine. Amazing.

02:43:08.940 --> 02:43:12.940
Hey Zero! Zero was so happy, what did he do to the machine?

02:43:12.940 --> 02:43:15.940
I was so happy that I basically shit all over the machine.

02:43:15.940 --> 02:43:19.940
He shit all over the machine!

02:43:19.940 --> 02:43:21.940
Figuratively shit.

02:43:21.940 --> 02:43:26.940
Alright, and Loki. He was so happy that he...

02:43:30.940 --> 02:43:33.940
There's nothing that has to do with suicide babies in this one!

02:43:33.940 --> 02:43:36.940
Jeez! I know my timing!

02:43:36.940 --> 02:43:43.940
Okay, alright, um, that he came all over the machine. There we go.

02:43:43.940 --> 02:43:48.940
He came all over the machine. Alright.

02:43:48.940 --> 02:43:53.940
Anita, what did he do? He was so happy when he got extra stage that he...

02:43:53.940 --> 02:43:54.940
Urinated!

02:43:54.940 --> 02:43:58.940
Urinated all over the DDR machine. Okay.

02:43:58.940 --> 02:44:02.940
And last celebrity, Dark Child. He was so happy he...

02:44:02.940 --> 02:44:07.940
busted a fat milky nut all over his man-juice coating the machine like a

02:44:07.940 --> 02:44:10.940
Krispy Kreme glazed donut.

02:44:12.940 --> 02:44:15.940
Hold on. Wait. Good answer! Good answer!

02:44:15.940 --> 02:44:19.940
I have to respond to that. Do not defame the Krispy Kremes.

02:44:19.940 --> 02:44:22.940
Can't you say like Bel-Air donuts or something?

02:44:22.940 --> 02:44:25.940
I'm hungry now and I want Krispy Kremes.

02:44:25.940 --> 02:44:27.940
I don't want those Krispy Kremes.

02:44:27.940 --> 02:44:33.940
New flavor of the month!

02:44:33.940 --> 02:44:34.940
Krispy Kreme Lemon

02:44:34.940 --> 02:44:37.940
And you know how many they'll sell? Here's a hint, it's in his name.

02:44:37.940 --> 02:44:44.940
Alright.

02:44:44.940 --> 02:44:47.940
Alright.

02:44:47.940 --> 02:44:49.940
Moving on, next question.

02:44:49.940 --> 02:44:56.940
Jamie was so excited to walk into game land to find that they had a radiant silver gun machine.

02:44:56.940 --> 02:45:00.200
The first thing she exclaimed was blank

02:45:26.940 --> 02:45:37.460
I'm waiting on one more contestant.

02:45:37.460 --> 02:45:39.660
Oh, I just changed keys.

02:45:39.660 --> 02:45:40.660
Yep.

02:45:40.660 --> 02:45:43.140
Jamie was so excited to walk into game land to find that they had a radiant silver gun

02:45:43.140 --> 02:45:44.140
machine.

02:45:44.140 --> 02:45:46.540
The first thing she exclaimed was blank.

02:45:46.540 --> 02:45:49.780
Do we have all the contestants in?

02:45:49.780 --> 02:45:50.780
Everyone in?

02:45:50.780 --> 02:45:51.780
Zero?

02:45:51.780 --> 02:45:52.780
I should go last.

02:45:52.780 --> 02:45:53.780
Here we go.

02:45:53.780 --> 02:45:54.780
Okay, if you want to go last, we'll go last.

02:45:54.780 --> 02:45:55.780
All right.

02:45:55.780 --> 02:46:20.540
p0k3smot42o

02:46:20.540 --> 02:46:26.620
the first thing she exclaimed, Justin Circut says, the first thing she exclaimed was, this

02:46:26.620 --> 02:46:33.620
game is mine! Dark Tetsuya said, the first thing she exclaimed was, squee! Alright, here

02:46:37.780 --> 02:46:40.740
we go, around the room. Jamie wants to go last, so we'll start with zero. What was the

02:46:40.740 --> 02:46:43.500
first thing? Oh, we're gonna go this way. Okay, we'll just go in backwards. Dark Child,

02:46:43.500 --> 02:46:50.500
first thing she said was

02:46:52.860 --> 02:46:54.140
okay Anita

02:46:54.140 --> 02:47:01.140
first thing she exclaimed was

02:47:02.380 --> 02:47:03.700
beautiful

02:47:03.700 --> 02:47:05.420
oh my god

02:47:05.420 --> 02:47:08.660
I just made my own Krispy Kreme glazed donut

02:47:08.660 --> 02:47:11.940
I just made my own Krispy Kreme glazed donut

02:47:11.940 --> 02:47:18.940
You're welcome.

02:47:20.500 --> 02:47:22.000
First thing she exclaimed was?

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:23.300
This is a hard one.

02:47:23.300 --> 02:47:24.620
Squee, of course.

02:47:24.620 --> 02:47:31.620
Alright, Squee, so we have a point for Dartsuya, hooray!

02:47:33.500 --> 02:47:36.440
Next up, Zero. First thing she exclaimed was?

02:47:36.440 --> 02:47:40.420
Why the fuck isn't anybody playing this game?

02:47:40.420 --> 02:47:43.260
I actually did think that.

02:47:43.260 --> 02:47:52.340
It was sitting there, beautiful, all alone, and for one credit, and I have to hold the

02:47:52.340 --> 02:48:00.420
microphone away so everyone holds your ears, I went, Squeak, like that.

02:48:00.420 --> 02:48:02.460
I actually made a mistake.

02:48:02.460 --> 02:48:07.500
Justin Circuit's answer was actually, because I only saw the part that was in caps, he actually

02:48:07.500 --> 02:48:12.140
said, Squeak, this game is mine. That was the full answer. So he actually got a point

02:48:12.140 --> 02:48:19.140
too. And they both get two points. Yes. So. But I did a very high pitched Squeak. Okay,

02:48:19.880 --> 02:48:26.880
so we are all tied up at 2-2. Oh my god, that game is beautiful. Okay. And Ikaruga is going

02:48:28.360 --> 02:48:33.780
to be out on the GameCube soon. Alright, uh, one more, okay, two more questions. Here we

02:49:03.780 --> 02:49:14.500
We're playing Orange Lounge Max game, Bomani Match game.

02:49:14.500 --> 02:49:15.940

Are all our celebrities locked in?

02:49:27.540 --> 02:49:28.540
No.

02:49:28.540 --> 02:49:31.540
Still going.

02:49:31.540 --> 02:49:58.820
p0k3smot42o

02:49:58.820 --> 02:50:02.280
But the arcade owner refused to get it because if I get that game there will be too much

02:50:02.580 --> 02:50:06.340
Justice circuit says pole dancing too much pole dancing

02:50:08.220 --> 02:50:13.260
Dark Tetsuya says there will be too much humping the coin slots. All right, Jamie

02:50:13.260 --> 02:50:19.880
What did you say nudist colony couldn't get it because there will be too much groin stank from sweaty balls groin stank from sweaty

02:50:21.620 --> 02:50:23.620
Oh my god, I

02:50:23.620 --> 02:50:29.620
I now have to save that to put into one of my future stories because I like that reference.

02:50:29.620 --> 02:50:33.620
I've just mentally thrown up.

02:50:33.620 --> 02:50:35.620
What?

02:50:35.620 --> 02:50:37.620
I've just mentally thrown up.

02:50:37.620 --> 02:50:40.620
Okay, but the nudist colony couldn't get it because there will be too much...

02:50:40.620 --> 02:50:42.620
Old people body parts flopping around.

02:50:42.620 --> 02:50:45.620
Old people body parts flopping around. Loki, I fear this answer.

02:50:45.620 --> 02:50:49.620
Does the nudist colony refuse to get parapar because there's going to be too much?

02:50:49.620 --> 02:51:00.620
Well, actually, you're going to have to rephrase it, because there's going to be too much of a nice fish market smell in the air.

02:51:00.620 --> 02:51:04.620
So kind of the reverse of the Stank Balls answer.

02:51:04.620 --> 02:51:06.620
Pubic Stank!

02:51:06.620 --> 02:51:16.620
Oh, God! That's a phrase I never wanted to hear on this show. It took 40 episodes to hear Pubic Stank on this show, thank you.

02:51:16.620 --> 02:51:21.620
Oh god, are we in kindergarten? We're making milestones every minute.

02:51:21.620 --> 02:51:22.620
Absolutely.

02:51:22.620 --> 02:51:28.620
Well, you know what my original answer was? My original answer was flying snake grenade.

02:51:28.620 --> 02:51:31.620
The pub stings.

02:51:31.620 --> 02:51:36.620
Anita, the nudist colony refused to get far apart because there would be too much...

02:51:36.620 --> 02:51:42.620
I don't understand why this is so funny. There would just be too much testicular dryness.

02:51:42.620 --> 02:51:46.420
this is a very serious subject we're talking about here I mean you don't do

02:51:46.420 --> 02:51:51.140
you understand the incidence of testicular dryness in this country you

02:51:51.140 --> 02:51:57.500
just don't even know how serious a problem it is Anita I think Anita just

02:51:57.500 --> 02:52:01.900
wants to volunteer to go over there and lick everyone's balls I have testicular

02:52:01.900 --> 02:52:11.900
If you want him to come faster, you need to lick his balls.

02:52:11.900 --> 02:52:18.780
Wow. Wow. All I can say is wow. Let's see if we get a match on this last one with Dark

02:52:18.780 --> 02:52:20.660
Child. Can I get the sound from Jamie, though?

02:52:20.660 --> 02:52:26.900
Yeah, we can. Okay. There will be too much bootleg porn on

02:52:26.900 --> 02:52:29.740
the internet. Bootleg porn on the internet. Good answer,

02:52:29.740 --> 02:52:36.740
but not a match.

02:52:59.740 --> 02:53:03.900
Robin was surprised that no one at the local gay bar knew what the DDR was

02:53:03.900 --> 02:53:08.040
he thought the best way to explain it to them was to blank

02:53:08.040 --> 02:53:15.040
however surprised that no one at the local gay bar knew what DDR was he

02:53:17.980 --> 02:53:20.720
thought the best way to explain it to them was to play

02:53:20.720 --> 02:53:23.340
0

02:53:23.340 --> 02:53:42.340
Rob was surprised that no one at the local gay bar knew what DDR was, because DDR is such a gay game. He thought that the best way to explain it to them was to blank.

02:53:42.340 --> 02:53:47.340
One contestant is locked in, I think. Let me just verify this answer.

02:53:48.340 --> 02:53:53.340
Ah, brilliant answer. I'm waiting on one more contestant.

02:53:53.340 --> 02:54:17.340
justincircuit says, we're going to have a tie, and there's not enough time for a tiebreaker.

02:54:17.340 --> 02:54:19.340
Alright, everybody's in.

02:54:19.340 --> 02:54:21.340
Okay, here we go.

02:54:21.340 --> 02:54:23.340
Justin Circuit says,

02:54:23.340 --> 02:54:25.340
Rob was surprised that no one at the local gay bar knew what DDR was.

02:54:25.340 --> 02:54:28.340
He thought the best way to explain it to them was to

02:54:28.340 --> 02:54:32.340
undress slowly while on the DDR machine.

02:54:32.340 --> 02:54:33.340
Blink.

02:54:33.340 --> 02:54:35.340
Except there's no DDR machine at the gay bar,

02:54:35.340 --> 02:54:41.340
or else I, I just, wouldn't I just point and say that's DDR?

02:54:41.340 --> 02:54:45.340
You, you, you point it, just not with your fingers.

02:54:45.340 --> 02:54:46.340
Whatever.

02:54:46.340 --> 02:54:54.340
Alright, DarkTetsuya says the best way to explain it to them was to grab the nearest chair and start stomping his feet wildly like he's playing Legend of Max.

02:54:54.340 --> 02:54:56.340
There we go. Good answer.

02:54:56.340 --> 02:54:58.340
Alright, let's see if it's either one of those two matches.

02:54:58.340 --> 02:55:02.340
Jamie, Rob's best way to explain this at the gay bar was to...

02:55:02.340 --> 02:55:04.340
Propel.

02:55:06.340 --> 02:55:08.340
Oh my god.

02:55:08.340 --> 02:55:11.340
That was a total, like, EOSFVB answer. Anyway...

02:55:11.340 --> 02:55:15.340
It was zero. The best way to explain it to them was to...

02:55:15.340 --> 02:55:18.340
Tell him DDR stood for Dick Dick Revolution.

02:55:18.340 --> 02:55:22.340
Tell him DDR stood for Dick Dick Revolution.

02:55:22.340 --> 02:55:28.340
And with some of the players, that's very true. In fact, if you go to this one arcade, it's called... never mind.

02:55:28.340 --> 02:55:32.340
That's a match game question for next week.

02:55:32.340 --> 02:55:37.340
Loki, Rob thought the best way to explain it to them was to...

02:55:37.340 --> 02:55:42.340
Was to point out anybody that's doing White Boy Freestyle.

02:55:42.340 --> 02:55:45.840
point out anybody that's doing white boy freestyle beautiful

02:55:45.840 --> 02:55:50.240
Anita, the best way to explain what DDR was was to

02:55:50.240 --> 02:55:53.920
I thought the best way was to strip butt naked

02:55:53.920 --> 02:55:56.960
in country line dance in front of the karaoke machine while playing

02:55:56.960 --> 02:56:01.280
It's Raining Men. I did that two weeks ago

02:56:01.280 --> 02:56:07.360
at least that involved nudity which is exciting

02:56:07.360 --> 02:56:20.360
The best way to explain DDR was to shimmy, sashay, pirouette, left cheek, right cheek, blow a kiss, pose. It's fabulous.

02:56:20.360 --> 02:56:27.360
Oh my god!

02:56:27.360 --> 02:56:34.360
Everybody wants to know how a dark child knows this.

02:56:34.360 --> 02:56:38.360
Well, what was that from, dark child?

02:56:38.360 --> 02:56:40.360
I don't know, it was from a bunch of two other things.

02:56:40.360 --> 02:56:42.360
Oh, even worse!

02:56:42.360 --> 02:56:46.360
It kind of reminds me, I think it's a scene in Dropkick Gorgeous, but anyway, doesn't matter.

02:56:46.360 --> 02:56:49.480
doesn't matter

02:56:49.480 --> 02:56:54.400
i was just thinking more of a priscilla queen of the desert ah there we go yes

02:56:54.400 --> 02:56:58.120
uh... so it ended in the tide tonight two points for dark tetsuya and two

02:56:58.120 --> 02:57:00.620
points for justin so that means we have

02:57:00.620 --> 02:57:01.960
no winner

02:57:01.960 --> 02:57:04.120
you can do we like it when there's no winner

02:57:04.120 --> 02:57:05.440
no

02:57:05.440 --> 02:57:06.640
uh...

02:57:06.640 --> 02:57:08.040
get better next time

02:57:08.040 --> 02:57:11.580
i think i like you to all the players who lost

02:57:11.580 --> 02:57:14.680
i'd i'd like it when no one wins because then we don't have to think of prizes to

02:57:14.680 --> 02:57:17.680
Well, what are some consolation prizes we should give these two for tying?

02:57:17.680 --> 02:57:19.680
A box of Rice-A-Roni, the San Francisco treat.

02:57:19.680 --> 02:57:22.680
Ding-ding.

02:57:22.680 --> 02:57:25.680
How about their own personal home version of Deep Pick Revolution?

02:57:25.680 --> 02:57:31.680
You two will personally get me explaining DDR to you in Anita Fashions.

02:57:31.680 --> 02:57:36.680
How about you make them get the next PC version of DDR?

02:57:36.680 --> 02:57:39.680
Mr. Spanky will come over and explain.

02:57:39.680 --> 02:57:42.680
They get a hand in a bottle of Crisco.

02:57:42.680 --> 02:57:44.680
That makes me a sad panda.

02:57:44.680 --> 02:57:47.680
Did you see what I thought you said?

02:57:47.680 --> 02:57:54.680
They get a hand in a can of Crisco.

02:57:54.680 --> 02:57:57.680
Ha!

02:57:57.680 --> 02:58:01.680
And it's time for the jingle.

02:58:01.680 --> 02:58:03.680
Ready?

02:58:03.680 --> 02:58:06.680
Rice-a-roni, the San Francisco treat.

02:58:06.680 --> 02:58:13.680
no

02:58:14.840 --> 02:58:19.640
by the way i have to give a public thank you over the air to uh... sharks girl

02:58:19.640 --> 02:58:22.200
for my filler bunny

02:58:22.200 --> 02:58:24.240
and then they

02:58:24.240 --> 02:58:28.040
is the big pink one that they can do it in the test tube

02:58:28.040 --> 02:58:32.520
nobody got me a filler bunny for my birthday

02:58:32.520 --> 02:58:35.040
hahahaha

02:58:35.040 --> 02:58:39.840
alright uh... it's time to end the show guys so let's go around and get

02:58:39.840 --> 02:58:43.880
everybody's final thought you'll start in your last or what

02:58:43.880 --> 02:58:45.840
final thought

02:58:45.840 --> 02:58:47.440
ask me

02:58:47.440 --> 02:58:52.040
zero i'm just happy i got a fucking job

02:58:52.040 --> 02:58:54.040
credulous

02:58:54.040 --> 02:58:57.320
low-key needs food badly

02:58:57.320 --> 02:58:59.680
anita final thought

02:58:59.680 --> 02:59:05.980
I've just detected a fault in the AE-35 unit.

02:59:05.980 --> 02:59:08.580
Ice Queen, final thought?

02:59:08.580 --> 02:59:11.740
I need sex.

02:59:11.740 --> 02:59:13.420
Dark Child, final thought?

02:59:13.420 --> 02:59:17.060
Dark Child is about to die.

02:59:17.060 --> 02:59:26.060
And my final thought is also, my final thought is also, I need sex, but not with Ice Queen.

02:59:26.060 --> 02:59:38.360
The final word of the night.

02:59:38.360 --> 02:59:39.360
Jamie got it last week.

02:59:39.360 --> 02:59:40.360
The final word of the night.

02:59:40.360 --> 02:59:43.200
Anita, what is tonight's final word of the night?

02:59:43.200 --> 02:59:50.360
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:59:50.360 --> 02:59:54.280
Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

02:59:54.280 --> 02:59:59.780

If you'd like to leave us a comment, send us an email at orangeloungeradio.yahoo.com.

03:00:06.780 --> 03:00:11.040
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:00:11.040 --> 03:00:15.480
Dungeons and dragons, Satan's game.

03:00:15.480 --> 03:00:21.380
Your children, like it or not, are attracted in their weaker years to the occult.

03:00:21.380 --> 03:00:26.880
and a game like D&D fuels their imagination and makes them feel special

03:00:26.880 --> 03:00:31.880
while drawing them deeper and deeper into the bowels of El Diablo.

03:00:31.880 --> 03:00:38.880
This afternoon, the Dead Ale Wives Watchtower invites you to sit in on an actual gaming session.

03:00:38.880 --> 03:00:41.880
Observe the previously unobservable,

03:00:41.880 --> 03:00:48.880
as a hidden camera takes you to the inner sanctum of Dungeons & Dragons.

03:00:48.880 --> 03:00:54.060
Galstaff, you have entered the door to the north.

03:00:54.060 --> 03:00:57.740
You are now by yourself, standing in a dark room.

03:00:57.740 --> 03:01:01.680
The pungent stench of mildew emanates from the wet dungeon walls.

03:01:01.680 --> 03:01:03.440
Where are the cheetos?

03:01:03.440 --> 03:01:04.600
They're right next to you.

03:01:04.600 --> 03:01:05.600
I cast a spell!

03:01:05.600 --> 03:01:07.420
Where's the mountain dew?

03:01:07.420 --> 03:01:08.960
In the fridge, duh!

03:01:08.960 --> 03:01:09.960
I wanna cast a spell!

03:01:09.960 --> 03:01:11.960
Can I have a mountain dew?

03:01:11.960 --> 03:01:12.960
Yes!

03:01:12.960 --> 03:01:14.640
You can have a mountain dew, just go get it!

03:01:14.640 --> 03:01:16.200
I can cast any of these, right?

03:01:16.200 --> 03:01:17.200
On the list?

03:01:17.200 --> 03:01:18.200
Yes.

03:01:18.200 --> 03:01:32.720
level one what room I want to cast magic missile he hasn't cast anything yet I

03:01:32.720 --> 03:01:37.600
am though if you'd listen I'm casting magic missile why are you casting magic

03:01:37.600 --> 03:01:46.880
missile there's nothing to attack here I'm attacking the darkness fine thanks

03:01:46.880 --> 03:01:49.780
You attack the darkness. There's an elf in front of you.

03:01:49.780 --> 03:01:51.580
Whoa! That's me, right?

03:01:51.580 --> 03:01:57.080
He's wearing a brown tunic, and he has gray hair and blue eyes.

03:01:57.080 --> 03:01:59.380
No, I don't. I have gray eyes.

03:01:59.380 --> 03:02:00.280
Let me see that sheet.

03:02:00.280 --> 03:02:04.280
Well, it says I have blue, but I decided I wanted gray eyes.

03:02:04.280 --> 03:02:08.780
Whatever. Okay, you guys can talk to each other now if you want.

03:02:08.780 --> 03:02:09.680
Hello.

03:02:09.680 --> 03:02:10.680
Hello.

03:02:10.680 --> 03:02:13.680
I am Galstaff, Sorcerer of Light.

03:02:13.680 --> 03:02:15.680
Then how come you had to cast magic missiles?

03:02:15.680 --> 03:02:20.680
You guys are being attacked.

03:02:20.680 --> 03:02:22.680
Do I see that happening?

03:02:22.680 --> 03:02:24.680
No, you're outside by the tavern.

03:02:24.680 --> 03:02:26.680
Cool, I get drunk.

03:02:26.680 --> 03:02:29.680
There are seven ogres surrounding you.

03:02:29.680 --> 03:02:32.680
How could they surround us? I had Mordenkainen's magical watchdog cast.

03:02:32.680 --> 03:02:33.680
No you didn't.

03:02:33.680 --> 03:02:36.680
I'm getting drunk. Are there any girls there?

03:02:36.680 --> 03:02:40.680
I totally did. You asked me if I wanted any equipment before this adventure and I said no.

03:02:40.680 --> 03:02:43.680
But I need material components for all my spells.

03:02:43.680 --> 03:02:48.020
So I cast Mordenkainen's faithful watchdog, but you never actually cast it

03:02:51.140 --> 03:02:53.140
Yeah, you are

03:02:53.820 --> 03:03:01.460
Yeah, I did though I completely fed when you asked me no you didn't you didn't actually say that you were casting the spell

03:03:01.460 --> 03:03:03.460
So now there's ogres. Okay

03:03:03.460 --> 03:03:08.460
Man, I got an ogre slaying knife! It's got a plus nine against ogres!

03:03:08.460 --> 03:03:10.460
You're not there! You're getting drunk!

03:03:10.460 --> 03:03:14.460
Okay, but if there's any girls there, I wanna do them!

03:03:14.460 --> 03:03:19.460
There you have it. A frightening look into America's most frightening pastime.

03:03:19.460 --> 03:03:26.460
Remember that it's not your children's fault that they're being drawn into a satanic world of nightmare.

03:03:26.460 --> 03:03:32.460
It's their gym teacher's fault for making them feel outcast when they couldn't do one single pull-up.

03:03:32.460 --> 03:03:43.420
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
