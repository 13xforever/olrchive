The days we spent together, well it was not a waste of time
Let me settle my mind through, so you're walking away from me
I'll just close my eyes and, it's a pain that I get inside
What is this fate? What is this fate? What is this fate in time?
What is this fate? What is this fate? I thought that you were mine
Well, it's time to say goodbye
I can't even realize
And I know you'll be the one in my whole life
I'll never forget the way that you kiss
The way that you smile forever
Where did it come from?
Oh, what is this space? What is this space? What is this space? What is this space?
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
Because Bongo demands it.
Howdy ho everybody, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 39, featuring
The Buzz, and we apologize about that.
I don't know what the hell we can do about it.
We've moved the computers, moved the subwoofers, tried to get everything magnetic away and
it's not helping.
Everyone die!
Yeah, the sound card sucks, so you'll just have to deal with it until we move into the
new studio for season number 3 and then we won't have The Buzz anymore, or we'll just
have to do every show from Jamie's from now on. Buy me a new sound card. So, wow, what
a week, huh? Yeah, it's been a while since we've been on the air. Well, not really, because
if you guys were listening last week, you heard us live at Shaft. About this time was
March Magic. Two years ago, you would have heard us live at Shaft. Oh, shit. With the
entire audience in here, who's actually listening to this outside? That is an excellent question.
the numbers in the studio are all-time high the numbers on the web all-time low
no hello to all of you listening we appreciate it
um...
yeah live from Shaft, my bad
I know I know, live from March Madness last week if you were
listening
about this time was when
DDR
the buzz went away for like half a second, it was amazing
This is about the time that DDR Idol was finishing up.
This is probably about the time that, oh, I don't know, maybe 23rd Magus was taking
the stage right after Dr. Dick finished his routine.
What are you shaking the microphones for?
They saw him rock up all the time.
Okay, well first off, you have two more mics, so why don't you try swapping one?
It won't help.
Trust me.
Trust me, I've done everything to do this buzz.
It's the noise of the hard drive.
The power of Christ compels you!
The power of Christ compels you!
You just made it worse. It's the noise of the hard drive in there. Or something. It's
fucked up. Anyway, so yeah, tournament. What'd you guys think? How did, uh, what'd you guys
think of those of you that went to March Madness? How was it?
A V.
Nice toss, Rob.
Um, B-
Uh, B in My Paradise sucks. I hate it.
Especially-
But it's Mr. Wendell. He makes everything good.
Yeah, but not for PA.
Yeah, not for PA.
Aw, you got owned.
Shut up. I've never played this-
You got owned.
I've never played it before.
But you got owned.
Ode. Shut the fuck up, man!
Ode.
Please say something.
Jeez, okay.
Young London Cobble Doubles sucked.
Okay, and...
Xenon also sucked.
Because it does, and it's really hard to PA.
Fuck that.
As for me, I came, I saw, I twitched.
The left arrow in Sakura sucks.
What the fuck is that, Celium and Mike?
It's in my hand, you're just like, wank!
What the fuck is that?
You can't let me get a comment in before you have to say some shit?
I didn't see shit. I didn't do shit but sit in that back room for both days while people flaked out on me.
Now you know how it feels.
Sorry.
Jamie was well done by the time that was over. She was cooking in that room there.
I hated people.
But we love Jamie.
We love Jamie for helping out, making everything run.
I mean, you got visited by lots of people, and you got to eat bubbles with me.
I didn't eat bubbles, I blew them.
Haha, she said blue.
Rob?
Yes.
Ow!
Rob died again.
You know, someone had to do the organizational stuff, and we're all grateful that Jamie did
bother to sit back there.
I would have done it myself but I was locked up in that goddamn glass box and trust me
it sucks hard being able to see the tournament and not hear a damn thing, especially on DDR.
I heard everything and didn't see a damn thing.
By the way, by the way, hold out your arm, you're dead too.
Jamie hit me with the tail of a furry thing.
You know I would have loved to have helped Jamie out in the back room but I was too busy
smoking and drinking behind everyone's backs.
You'll have to forgive Jamie, she's been on a battle royale kick lately.
We all have.
And we played mocap golf.
Only because it freaking rode over for like three holes and then you happened to get lucky and win one.
Otherwise it would have kicked your ass.
Oh shut up.
Yeah, who won the long drive?
Yeah that's right, I think I won the long drive.
So watch this, shut the hell up.
Drive for show, putt for dough, bitch.
Whatever.
Dude, I hit a 50-foot chip to make an eagle.
So?
Ooh, wow.
It was cool.
I've made chips for eagles and burritos before. It's easy.
Yeah. Well, you know what? That was my first one, so you can shut your mouth.
Hey, have you actually ever gotten par on that one that goes uphill?
The one that goes, like, really, really steep uphill.
Yes, I have gotten par on that twice.
God damn, I got like a quadruple bogey on that shit.
I have Propel!
This is the reason why golf is on TV and no one watches it.
Okay, welcome to Orange Lounge, mocap golf radio.
Someone must watch it, they have the golf channel.
I want mocap battle royale.
I want mocap battle royale.
Mocap napping.
I want somebody, anyone who has programming skill, get like, you know, Quake or one of those things, what was it you were saying, Counter Strike?
and make the battle royale counter strike
oh wait let me just say that real quick some guy hit a 357 yard drive and got
like a 63 to win some championship or something course record
good but god still hates it 357 yards in one hole
yeah in real life god hates golfers
hey what does Dave look like he's obi-wan over here golf is paid for by
morons who buy ugly pants use the force
but anyways no that's why Plaid will never go out of fashion because of golfers
I know you said that Counter Strike sucks for doing it, but for Battle Royale, Counter Strike is like the best thing to edit.
I hit a vital organ.
That's the easiest thing to do.
And by the way, yes, why, thank you for asking. Yes, I did compete last week in freestyle, and I got all fails.
How did that go, your very first freestyle?
I had a nervous breakdown about five minutes before it was my turn because like I fell playing a challenge in front of everybody and then I like freaked out and then I got up and finally played.
And I think I did alright for my first but it's old school and no one likes old school anymore. So fuck them.
Don't start that again.
Yes and for those of you in the chat room and listening who got to hear my lovely little rant remember it because you'll never hear it again.
I want to know who those chicks were that were massaging my hair. I have no idea who those people were, and they're just coming up against me for DVDs.
Okay, hold on, I've realized something. Don't steal a girl's glasses, because then she follows you around and annoys all your friends.
She just had these cool glasses and I stole them, and then she decided that she would try to fuck everybody or something. I don't know what it was, she was doing it.
So that's what I was doing wrong when I was singles.
I didn't steal glasses.
Mental notes!
I didn't steal glasses.
Yeah, you gotta steal the nerd glasses.
So that's how I get the preteen booty.
They were hoes anyway, you could tell.
Yeah, yeah.
Uh oh, looks like you hit a nerve.
Like I was telling two friends after the first day of the tourney,
What walks on two legs and spells slut?
What?
I'm not saying it on the air.
This is quiet, so...
Oh, what I need is a good defense.
So anyways, yeah, it was Let the Beat Hit Em that I freestyled to.
Watch the video. It's another white guy freestyling, or some white guy doing Let the Beat Hit Em. That's what the title is.
Yeah, that's what you got titled as, some white guy.
Some white guy. I am some white guy. That's great.
Xerox.
Well, he didn't even get my song.
Okay, fuck that shit, alright?
It's fucking clearly Zero Space X.
I don't know where the fuck somebody gets Xerox.
Okay, it doesn't even start with an X.
I mean, fucking go to school.
Fucking goat bite. Fucking morons.
At least you got your name.
You have to realize that when everybody sees that, and everybody says...
Blah, blah, blah, fuck you!
When everybody is saying...
Does it matter?
Zero X.
Hooked on phonics works for me!
Not for them!
I've got yellow fever!
There's a snake in my boot!
You know what? They were reading it as one word because they thought it was Asian typing.
Do me, do me, do me.
Well hey, my first tournament at March Madness last year, I was elect-toddled or something.
I looked at that paper, and it was clearly written 0x.
I mean, if you were that big of a moron, I'm sorry.
Well you just thought you were lead to Xerox with a Z.
You know what, I don't give a fuck. You could go to school. Go buy a Xerox machine!
I'm still ski.
Okay, I guess that makes it a little better, but I'm still not fucking Xeroxed.
At least you're not some white guy doing some song.
I am some white guy, and I swear to God if another face goes in my hand, another hand goes in my face, I'm gonna punch somebody.
I'm blind!
What up, mah honkies?
I am some white guy.
You are some white guy, but I am the other white guy.
Okay, Freestyler.
Whatever, Intern.
Ooh, intern, that's a thing.
Well, at least he's part of staff.
I die.
I'm still curious to see who's actually here.
Oh, with the P.
Moving right along.
Let's talk about why everyone's here right now.
They're all here to see me.
I think actually the celebrity of the weekend
would be DDR Angel, who's back.
OK, and then Jamie.
So, Angel, you've been where for the past five weeks?
I went to Japan for five weeks, and I missed all of you guys for five weeks, but that's okay.
What part of Japan did you go to?
I went to Kyushu Island, which is basically the southernmost, almost the southernmost part of Japan.
Kyushu Island, Kagoshima City.
So what kind of stuff did you get to see while you were there?
You want to hear a story?
Yeah, let's hear a story.
A funny story?
Yay!
Well, I thought it was funny, but okay.
This is the worst time. The buzz stops.
I know. Just ignore the buzz.
Shut up!
Alright. Alright, so...
I went shopping one day with my relatives and my mother and whatever.
Okay, so I walk into the store.
What do I hear right outside the door?
DDR music.
I run through the store frantically looking for a DDR machine going,
I gotta play. I gotta play. I gotta play.
I mean, I sounded like Loki, okay?
Where's the machine? Where's the machine? Where's the machine?
Did I find it? Did I find it? No, no, no, I didn't find it.
I ended up noticing that it was coming from the freaking loudspeaker!
So, I woke up to this lady that was working there, and I kindly asked her,
Was it her CD? Just, you know, by the off chance that it might have been.
And she said no, that it was the stores.
So...
No, no, no.
See, cause then I said, can I buy it?
And then she looked at me like a weird look, or with a weird look.
And then she was probably saying in her head,
she was stupid American.
So, did you get to go to any arcades while you were down there?
Yeah, I got to go to one.
Is DDR dead?
I got to play some Japanese people, and they thought I was cool, and they thought I was really good.
And I kicked his ass.
That's awesome. Did you actually play DDR?
Yes I did.
And there were actually other people playing DDR?
Yes.
I knew it was rumors.
Yes, I played Popin' Music 9.
How was Popin' Music?
Popin' Music was okay, but unfortunately, sorry Joe, but can I do that?
Sure, man.
Dude.
Anyways.
We were playing Poppin' Music here last night because our new Bimani friend Garrett brought it over, and it has Boa Boa Lady Another on it. That, in itself, made my day.
We'll get to, we'll get to, we're still going on the Japan trip, we'll catch up to present.
Where was I?
Poppin' Music 9.
That's right, Poppin' Music 9. Now what was the rumor that was going around for Poppin' Music 9?
Absolut.
Yes, absolute. I played absolute. And what did I do? What did I do? I passed it!
Yay!
There is proof! Rob has proof!
Tron was in it. Tron was in it.
Well, Doctor 2 apparently thought it was a rumor, I don't know.
Whatever, whatever. So we know it's really there and all that jazz.
Speaking of which, I will be going to Japan in two weeks, or two weeks, so that will be cool.
Dave gets it! Squeak!
I'm going to Tokyo and Kyoto and Osaka, and I'm not going to Baidu Park.
But what? Why? Because my brother is there right now, and we're going to see him because over the summer he will be in Tokyo doing something for work.
for work or something like that and so he'll be doing something and so we're
going to see him because it'll be like last time and I'm going to be in Tokyo
for three days and then I think Osaka for like a week and Kyoto for a few days
and I will go to an arcade and I will see if I'll yeah I'll go to the really
big one in Tokyo and I'll be like wow there's no playing DVR it's in the corner
My brother went to a fairly large arcade there and they had a whole Bomani corner and he took a picture of it. It was empty. There was no one playing.
Hey Dave, do you really want to get drunk in Japan?
I don't know.
Because I know a really quick way.
How?
Go to a vending machine that has beer and like nobody's watching you still money in it and you can get beer and get drunk
Japanese beer isn't that good?
Yeah, but they have sake too
Dun dun dun. I have a question for angel. No, I have a search for Rachel
Did you were there any other like interesting games that you saw there?
Like new games that a lot of people seem to be playing like maybe outside of Omani or any other kinds of games that seem to
What kind of game was it, like a fighting game?
It seemed like it was a racing game, so maybe it's another Initial D.
Initial D is also ridiculously popular in the Asian sector.
There were like five Initial D machines in this arcade I saw in Singapore, and in the freaking airport in Korea they had an Initial D machine.
Which leads me to believe that, you know, and they had to pump it up and lose to Korea, so...
My uncle and my aunt and everybody was looking at me and I was like, sorry?
Okay, now I'm considered crazy great.
Did you get to eat at America Town?
For anybody that saw The Simpsons?
What in the? Alright, whatever.
Okay, there's an episode of The Simpsons where they go to Japan and Homer's, you know, where do they want to eat?
Homer wants to go eat at America Town and Marge is like, we could eat American food back home.
But he insists they go to America Town.
And then the waiter is like, hi, I am stupid American waiter. Can I take your order? Would you like meat, food?
When you go, I'll get you the address for the Taito arcade. You need to go there and take me pictures, because I want to go there to see the rose and rose upon bubble wobble machine.
There's so many people I know going to Japan in the next week or two. It's crazy.
No, seriously, my roommate's going to Japan for a year, Angel just came back to Japan,
Dave's now going to Japan, one of my really good friends in Seattle is going to Japan.
I've had so much shit coming back for me, it's not even funny.
You have to bring me back a magazine, Dave.
Dave.
Bring me back a magazine.
Dave, I have another quick request, I have another quick request.
If I loaned you a remote kit, would you go and do interviews with people in the arcade?
Would you just do random interviews?
Dude, Baka Gaijin on the street would be the greatest segment ever.
American in Japan. Come on, you gotta do it. Well, what would I interview them on?
Ramani, you gotta go to the arcade. You're gonna go to an arcade while you're there,
right? Yeah. Just say, hey, I'm from the American media. And say, there's this really big American
show and I wanna talk to you about this game that's taking over America. And they'll probably
go, huh? I just talked to random businessmen and like, Sarariman! I could try. I mean,
I don't know Genki da and then go orange lounge radio. Yay
Say you're from orange launch radio you you'll get laughed out of the country. Okay. All right sons bonsai. Oh
My god state you asked you on the show. Oh
Wait, wait, wait Rob
Another random sighting. What's that?
Synchronized love during a car commercial with like a bunch of horror girls and black and yeah
Yeah, my friend had a cow.
Did you happen to get to see any Para clubs?
Or did you get to go to any Para clubs?
Did you go to a store that sold big boots?
No.
Boring.
Yeah, but I was at this...
Remember, Para's a big thing in Tokyo and Osaka.
And she wasn't there, so...
True.
True enough.
Okay, so anything else you want to tell us about your trip?
Um, not, except, uh, you have to post that one picture of that, um, unmentionable thing, that I was talking about, that nobody knows about in America.
I'll have to find it.
I'll find it for you.
Okay, we'll have to find it later.
Neat, um...
I have an F.U. about everything later, by the way, if that's okay with you.
We'll do F.U.s later.
What?
Super toilet, maybe.
Maybe?
Okay, so, moving right along. So, Angel comes back into town, we decide to have a little
welcome home party last night, so that's why everybody was here. Almost everybody! Somebody
forgot to, I don't know, inform me that this stuff was going on! Everyone's like, everyone's
like, hey, you going to the party? What party? There was a frickin' huge party here last
night, there was like, literally everybody was there, and everyone's still here. It was
not my job to send out the invitations, I thought everybody knew through the chat room,
I thought Angel was harassing everybody as they came to the chat room.
I didn't even know about it until we looked in your live journal.
Yeah, I didn't even know about it, so fuck you.
I brought it up to her and she's like, what party?
It wasn't supposed to be a party, it was supposed to be friends come over and we hang out and
then we go to Scandia.
We're going to have a social gathering and have a good caravan that goes to Scandia.
Suddenly, oh my gods, there's a party going on in my house.
Well dude, there was popin' music.
I mean, it's popin'!
What's that stand in there?
I brought germania.
Yeah, you did, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
But there was popin'.
And Rob's all like,
Angel's coming, Angel's coming, Angel's coming!
Do a theater near you!
This summer, Angel...
Angel returns, coming to a theater near you this summer.
Anyway, yeah. Hi.
So, we had a party, and we watched Battle Royale, because Angel hadn't seen this movie.
And if you haven't seen Battle Royale yet, Jamie, break it down.
Talk about what Battle Royale's all about, for those who haven't seen.
In the future, students boycott school, so the Japanese government decides to enact the B.E.R. Act,
which means that they figure randomly selected 9th grade class, put them all on an island, and they have to kill each other until one's left.
There's a lot more symbolic meaning behind that.
True, but I like watching all the deaths.
But watching a whole bunch of really pretty Japanese people kill each other is a sheer joy in life.
Dude, it was all about Mitsuko.
I don't want to be a loser.
Jayama, my hero.
He was my hero. If he was a good guy, it would have been better.
The guy who had the radio that told me where everybody else was, I would have lived a lot longer than he did, you know?
Dude, he lived a long time.
That was Hiroki who had the GPS, but my favorite was Mimura, the hacker.
He's Mimura.
He was so awesome, and I finally caught the pun of the name of his computer, the third man.
Ah.
After his own name, Mimura.
But then of course after we watched Battle Royale, what did you think of Battle Royale, Angel? The first time seeing it?
It kicked much ass, and then we had much fun afterwards.
Yes, after we watched Battle Royale, a battle royale broke out in my living room with paper
plates and magic markers.
And scotch tape and red marker and...
I wrote up name tags for people who died and how they died.
DDR Angel choked on a pretzel.
And all the time I was in the other room playing pop music.
I got hit in the eye with a candle.
Choked on a pretzel?
even want to know she was hanging out with George Bush okay now I know I don't
want to know so now we're thinking gee how can we incorporate battle royale to
our everyday lives and one idea is maybe we could just go to Qsar and take our
frustrations out that way but Qsar is not messy enough so we decided maybe
paintball but then paintball paintballs hurt they really do hurt when they
shall wear loose clothes or thinking doesn't hurt you talk to my friend did
You're trying to get me to buy the gun as well!
Damn you! Damn you!
I know you, Andy!
You've gotten to them also!
What we need to do is we actually need to make the survival packs.
And pick a place, go camping.
And we need to give one person a fan.
Give some person a pellet gun.
You know?
Dude, seriously.
When Battle Royale first came out,
Tokyo Pop the magazine had this big huge feature on it and it had all the weapons of the kids
that you didn't see on TV and there were some seriously ridiculous ones like a pot lid.
Dude the pot lid was the best thing in the movie and it even proved it.
Battle Royale Online dot com.
Go there.
But yeah I mean seriously.
The pot lid was the best and everybody knows it because it saved his life.
Dude the psycho guy Kiriyama he got the freaking Hadasen.
He was my hero and he killed everybody.
And one of the girls who was up on the mountain, like one of them got the megaphone.
The other girl with her got a headband that said, go for it.
But seriously, in my opinion, the best character was our...
Well, I'm not going to give it away. Never mind.
My favorite guy was the other foreign exchange student.
Yeah.
Yeah, how would that give them away?
The one who helped them out.
What would that point be?
One more thing about Japan.
Oh man, you're in the winner's pool, how many does he need to go back and forth?
Yeah, go. Rough.
Anyways!
What do you need now?
Huh?
What do you need?
There's one thing that we roll over Japan, okay?
What?
I saw no, no Extreme Machines over there! None! None!
Really?
And we have them all over the place, so what happens?
Extreme Machines!
DDR is dead.
DDR is dead.
But that means I'm dead.
You're not dead.
Look at the beginning of my name.
You've got to remember that in Japan the fad, the life cycle for fads there is like ridiculously
fast.
You know what, in a year, no not even a year, in like three months you're going to change
your nickname to 2DX Angel.
Because why, what happens?
Everybody gets, everybody gets freaking burned out on DDR and then they're all of a sudden
they're 2DX.
So you'll be 2DX Angel in three months, I guarantee it.
Is 2DX still big there, or is it like, is all the monies dead?
Trust me, she hasn't been getting very good.
Haven't you?
Actually, I got some, like, schoolgirls to, like, take a picture, so it's cool.
They were playing, and they were-
Hey, you can pass, yeah, you can pass 5-1-1.
Loki!
Would you like to make a comment on schoolgirls?
Ooh, schoolgirls.
Roses are red, violets are blue.
This show's about panties.
the back of the colorful DVD that Loki gave us all during March Madness it's
just like what the fuck it's also got an alternate cover in the other side more
panty action you actually see butt crack in that one the one suggestion for
battle royale that didn't get said was that we were all gonna wear white
sweaters or white sweatshirts and white sweatpants and then like have magic
We just draw over each other.
No, no.
We're actually...
I think we do that.
We need to do like actual...
We need to make like fake uniforms or something.
Okay, we would either...
If we all walked around in white shirts...
No, because that's what stands by.
If we all walked around in white shirts and white pants, these people would either think
A, we're doing Battle Royale or B, we're the next Heaven's Gate.
What was that?
That was on Loki's old sig?
Drink the Kool-Aid and follow the comet?
Die, die, die.
Seriously though, we should go back to Q's art.
He's rapping cool.
And then we have like a, a, a Guacamole Del Taco inspired keychain.
He said pull down, should I be afraid yet?
I have Pocari Sweat.
Angel Rules!
Again.
Alright.
On that note, we're gonna go to a quick break, or we're gonna come back and we're gonna do
the FUs of the Week.
Let's play more songs like that.
Or we can talk about news.
What do you wanna do?
Let's do news.
Okay, we'll do, we'll do news when we come back, not FUs just yet.
So, we're going to do songs that suck. No, don't pick them from there. Do this. If you want songs that suck, go to this directory.
No, I want that song, actually.
You do want that? Okay, we're not going to do songs that suck. This one? Okay.
Alright.
But not in the first place. Do them both.
Okay. We'll be back in a little bit and we're going to talk about Bamani news. Oh my god.
And we'll do the FUs of the Week, Cage Match, Match Game. It's all coming up. Thanks for listening.

Hi. You're a little—son of a bitch.
Super Patapata, you're a beast!
I need to turn the repeat thing off. My bad.
You should have seen it earlier at Scandia today. I licked Meg's titties.
Don't do that, please.
Angels got the proof.
Yes, you have photographic proof.
So, um, hi, what were we going to talk about when we come back? Oh yeah, news. Loki, give us news.
Hold it first. Rob?
What?
Photographic proof will be up on www.ungluedbemind.tk tomorrow.
Hooray.
Anyway, so I'm with actual news for once, because we've been lacking for quite a while.
You big dirty liar!
Shut up!
Anyways, we're going to start talking about, first thing of course is going to be MaxTube.
The release is coming out in a couple of weeks actually, for the home versions, and I've
already got it on order, so it's cool.
But what's awesome is it's going to be coming with yet another v-rare, and what's cool is
I think this is going to be a hint at some of the stuff that we're going to see as hidden songs in Max 2, and also as stuff that's going to be DDR Extreme 2.
So, let's go down the list here, um, see...
This is not what I wanted.
Okay, hold on. Let's see, um...
La la la. Oops.
And, let's see here...
There we go.
That's the one that we were just looking at.
Yeah, way to go.
There we go. Alright.
Now, the songs that will be in there. We've got some, it looks like the Max 2 for the home version is going to be the System SF remix of the whole, you know, series.
We've got first brand new song by them, Feelings Won't Fade extended trans mix that's going to be on the V-Rare CD. Plus three songs that are going to be hidden within Max that are going to be long versions of those songs.
We've also got Kind Lady, the Future Trance mix, Midnight Blaze, the System SF mix, Glacial,
which is the brand new Ryu Kosuka song, and an I Feel New Age Hope mix, which is also
by System SF.
Because everyone got a big fat Woody over drop the bomb System SF mix, now it's like,
oh, let's let the dude remix everything.
Yeah?
Pretty much.
Pretty much, I think I summed it up.
But these songs right here, I'm predicting it here, you're going to see those all his
that's hidden songs in Max 2. Those are all going to be hidden songs in there.
And they're also going to be probably in...let's see...
They're also going to be...
Sorry, I flashed Jimmy. Anyways, they're also
going to be hidden songs with...or also going to be new songs for probably the US Max 2
and also going to be in
you know, obviously, DDR Extreme 2, so look for those, and we'll probably have MP3s as well as Bamaiso have MP3s.
They quote six hours after the game comes out, they will have MP3s up on their site, so look for them.
They should have the MP3s there.
Now, also, on top of that, since we're...
Actually, I'd hate to cut you off, but you know, when Max USA came out, we actually went live and played Max USA on air.
We'll do the same thing for Max 2.
Okay.
And let's see now, we've also got, since we were talking about that, more info on Max 2. They've announced some of the playlist, or some of the song list that's going to be there.
It's going to be a lot of, pretty much everything has come back from the arcade version of Max 2, except A Minute, let me see, I believe it is A Minute, the Whistle song, ah shit, there's like four songs that they were cut.
Anyways, so those will not be back.
Um, there's rumors that they're gonna be just, you know,
unlocks, but I don't know.
There's another, there's another picture that they said that they saw a minute in it for the home version,
so it's possible it's an unlock.
Also on top of that, you're gonna have some of the older songs.
You're gonna have Kind Lady and So in Love in there,
plus, you know, Dynamite Rave and all the old, uh, pretty much all the third mixed stuff.
All the barfeed caddas.
Yeah, all those that were in there before.
And there's gonna be some DDR Extreme preview tracks in there.
Like.
Crash.
But here's the thing. It's going to be basically, just like the, which I'll be covering in just a second, the Dancing Stage Megamix, which is going to have Crash, Vanity Angel, and Memories. All the Euromix 2 stuff. So that's what I predict will be in probably Max 2 there, is those three songs, maybe some more, but I'm guessing those three for sure.
Cool.
On top of that, there's going to be oni modes as well, and the ability to make your own custom oni modes.
Neat.
Custom onis, so that'll be kind of cool.
Stop it!
What the fuck are you doing with this stupid hedgehog flying over my damn head?
Or weasel or whatever the fuck that is.
Anyways, so that's what's coming up, we'll have that.
Now, aside from all that, I mean it. I'm going to rip that thing in half.
What? Am I the moki in the middle? Is my moki in the middle?
No, no, no. You're the loki in the middle.
Okay, anyways, so now let's get to some other news other than that.
We'll cover Dancing Stage Megamix in just a second.
Really quickly here, moving along, we've got Popping Music 9 info.
And this is kind of cool. They were talking about, it sounds like it's almost like Bishi Boshi here.
BoshiBoshi here. Now they have Popping Music 9 Imal, which is, I guess, it's going to be a version of Popping Music 9. It's kind of like the powered up versions of Guitar Freaks where it has, you know, the e-cards that are going to go in there, you know, the magnetic cards that store all your data, and you're going to have a lot of different modes in there. Like, for instance, you can, like, swap, I guess you can earn items in this game with the scores that you get to buy stuff and you can send it to each other. They have, well, let's see, let's get to the actual cool stuff.
They've got a minigame in it that's called Bomani that's actually like Beatmania because there's a turntable on this machine.
There's a turntable and two keys, which is kind of weird. Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.
They've got another game called Pooka Pooka, which is in...
Sounds dirty.
This game, you use the buttons to avoid objects while trying to reach the good, whatever the fuck that means.
uh...
entirely practice you know something like that uh... people tennis it pretty
much it sounds like fishy-boshy you know
and they're gonna have some songs uh... new songs
but now
ok
some else
the uh... thing that you've probably been waiting for guitar freaks nine
we found out that they actually have
i don't even wanna know what's going on behind me ok honestly i see flashes of light
and a stupid weasel thing flying around
i don't wanna know
what you guys are taking pictures of
especially since it's around my ass
i'm really afraid to see what that stupid thing is doing to my ass ok
so anyways
now guitar freaks
we've got a lot of transplants songs from pop music that are going to be in it
plus some pretty cool shit we've got uh... apple and honey from pop music that's going to be in there
uh... c777 from pop music impulse of blue now that sounds like blue impulse
but you know it's probably a different song
uh... i'm a loser
that's going to be in their uh... we've got the extra stage as being quite a
skill by jimmy wack also might remember he is the guy that did uh... across the
nightmare
we've also got the on court stage from dance maniacs mad black by the
infection which is really awesome so
uh... that bonus tracks we're gonna have you know some longer since i think we
have a dream tonight uh... twinkle star cries in the wilderness and
uh... used to rock and roll that is in an election system the black horizon
sounds pretty sweet. And they have an encore stage of model DD4 which I believe is a sequel
to another song they did. Oh dear. Let's see, now license songs, they're really cool. They've
got Party Hard by Andrew W.K. You might remember that song. They've also got Show Business
by ACDC. Oh dear god. No! No! No! No! No! And Mr. Children, I recognize Mr. Children,
or Cross River Mr. Children I think. But there's some other J-Rock stuff in there too, I don't
no j-rock so I mean I don't know look at the list um he told me is the one who
did my sweet darlin all right and she has a song called a Dante now now that's
all out of the way that's all about guitar freaks night and drum meeting
eighth yes so now we're gonna have Wow I'm so moist in anticipation of guitar
That's just gross.
Okay, now, finally, with the list of the song, the game will probably never play because it's in Europe. Fucking Europeans.
They've got a brand new dancing stage megamix. It's going to be basically equivalent to R-Max 2 or whatever.
Anyways, it's going to have seven licensed songs, Stealing Beats by Kid Galahad.
Never heard of it.
Love at First Sight by Kylie Minogue.
I have that, we can play it.
Love Cats by The Cure.
That's so awesome that the Cure gets into DDR, and it's a shitty song.
When you look at me by Christina Milan, shake your body by Shai FX and T-Power featuring D.J.
One Step Closer by S. John G.
And a little less conversation Elvis vs. J. X.
Little less conversation. Little less conversation.
I don't know the fucking word, but I'm just going to make them up.
They're pretty much going to have the same shit we're going to have on our DDR Max 2.
It's going to be all the Konami Originals, plus the preview songs from DDR Extreme.
Same shit there.
But here's what the funny part is.
Their unlock system. Their unlock system is a joke.
Isn't it like you just play a song? You don't even have to pass it. You just play it and then...
Dink! You get an unlock!
3 unlocks, you get training mode, 6 points, you get edit mode, you get 10 points and pass
70 songs, you get max 300, 15 points and 100 songs, you get endless modes. Whoopity-doo.
What a shit. Alright, that's it, that's all the news I have. Yay, that was wonderful.
Oh, and if the DDR Extreme OST came out, the non-stop sucks ass. That's it. Why does the
non-stop suck-ass remix shit they didn't remix anything okay now next up on the

That was fucked up.
So I guess now before we get to the FUs of the week,
I have to give everyone in the room a lecture.
Last week, the FUs of the week went on for like an hour.
So let's try to keep them short tonight.
Think about what your FUs of the week are now.
Think about what your FUs of the week
are now before the microphone gets to you.
Thank you.
Why am I still trying to pull up the terror mix of slag work? I do not know.
Okay, let's start it off with the only woman who can start this off, the FUs of the week.
I had aches at one moment, and now it's all gone.
Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is a fucked up.
the battle royale of the roads, with me as the victor, and them all lying in bloody, burned, ooh, a tank! Oh, that's right, I need a tank! Somebody give me a tank.
And my other fight goes toward, my birthday is on the 19th, okay? And I can't go do my normal thing that I do because I don't have money, so someone buy me the battle royale novel, thank you.
Alright, moving on, let's hear it from Loki.
Damn it, I missed...
I, like, forgot a lot of them. But that's alright, that's alright, that's alright.
Alright, uh, start it off.
Um, big eff you to the stupid bitch that was sitting next to us.
Actually, big bitch that was sitting next to us at the movie theater yesterday.
First off, there was plenty of other seats, but no, your fat ass had to move in front of us before the show.
We did before the show!
their statement of the kids that next to me too
and then they're fucking
after all that she
you know having your cell phone on during the movie and then they arrange
the evidence are talking to the public set up so i
and i hear it there with the fact
uh... began to offer to the stupid uh...
bastards that
drive cars in parking lot
when i get back out the fucking work your car behind mine
The next time you do that, I'm gonna back up at full speed and kill you.
That's it. Simple as that. Especially if you're just a pedestrian standing there,
that's even worse, so make it nice and easy for me to run over you.
So, um, yeah.
So don't get in my way in, uh, parking lots.
Stop distracting me to all this pencil crap!
Seriously!
Are you, are you done?
No, I'm not done! He bothered me!
Are you done now?
um...
for now because i can't remember
they'll come back
i have a few ideas of the week i'd like to get out
my first f u goes to daylight savings time
no it's my turn hold on
hold on we'll go back we'll go back
my first f u goes to daylight savings time what the fuck
an hour of sleep lost
because somebody decided we needed more suns so the children can play outdoors
uh... act like that you're killed rob not safe to play on actually because um...
you know, the year isn't exactly 365 days, and that there's an actual, you know, wait,
no, that's leap years. Never mind, I don't know.
I don't give a shit. It sucks my balls. Not every country celebrates it. Why do we have
to? I lost an hour of sleep. Lick me. Arizona rules. Okay. Uh, what else? Yeah, Arizona
doesn't celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day either. They're kind of fucked up. Um, uh,
else am I trying to think of? Oh, there was something else. FU to having a crush and not
knowing what to do with it. I hate that. FU to traffic. I hate cars. FU to... FU to zero.
He's looking at me funny. I'm just kidding. I couldn't think of anything else. Alright,
back to Logi. This is going to be an FU to pretty much everyone that was not competing
I don't put judges for here. I don't listen you stupid bastard
I worked hours on the fucking audio setup the reason you can't hear yourself the mic cuz you're whispering into the fucking mic
Talk loudly I did sound check so you can hear people
Yes, I can't hear myself because I'm talking really quietly turn it up turn it up speak louder. You stupid bastard
That news the guy that played Simon you really sucked you pushed out man
I like that guy. He was great.
Well, he pussed out, man.
He was good, but had failure not had bronchitis.
He pussed out. I could have been a better Simon.
That's right. I would have hated everyone, so I guess I couldn't have done that.
Well, there might be something involving American Idol on this station in the future.
Who knows? Ideas are going around.
Anyway, so F you tonight, and F you for eBay for having me addicted.
I'm done.
Alright, moving on. Let's go around the room. We'll start with, what? Let's start with Tal. He's over here. We'll go this way.
Alright, Tal, kick it off. What's up?
I'd like to give a nice fuck you to, oh, everybody who's ever gone to Scandia.
Except for, you know, my friend, because we're intelligent people.
We know what English is. We speak it. We know how to read it.
We know what it means to be able to follow instructions. You know?
Yes, this is the best background ever.
And I'd like to give a...
Dude, there's some seriously retarded people out there. It's so scary.
I want to know, just how many people, when we came back after the tournament,
while I was playing 2DX, how many people came up with that token machine?
Put money in it. When it said, please use another changer.
Dude, you know...
People are stupid and can't read.
And one person was like, oh my god, the machine stopped working.
And I stopped in my game and said, read the sign.
You know what area Scandia is located at, right?
You have to leave people who are illiterate there.
Yeah, but people are just as stupid who go to RVGL.
There's nothing that made me want to go back and get my college degree.
At least there are more retards at RVGL than at Scandia.
No, dude, seriously.
Until you work, there are retards that work in RVGL.
There's retards at Scandia, and then there's just people who expect other people to afford them at RNG.
And then it's like this, people at Scandia don't have a choice, the people at RNG don't do.
That isn't even worse.
It's usually, it boggles the brain.
And um, let's see, what else would I like to do next year?
Yes.
I'd like to give a nice big fakirigitaru, man, because I don't have it, and I really, really want it.
And it's like...
And, um, wait, God, I had a whole list of them today, but I don't remember, so I'll come back.
Wait, no, I won't. I'll keep this, because I'm on my court.
My turn!
Okay, uh, my first, my first lucky goes to being broke.
Because I have, like, I am, I had to live off $20 this weekend because that's, like, almost all I have left until I get more luck.
Fuck you to expiring ATM cards. I've had no money this weekend.
Okay, well...
It's still the chase, yeah.
Okay.
Now, uh...
Oh, yeah.
Okay, well, anyway, um, also...
Fuck you to bad grades.
Cause it sucks.
Shut up!
Hey, man.
I'm just fucking with you, man.
No more messing around, man.
And also...
Fuck my bike, because it got another flat tire.
Yeah, on my bike.
Yes.
And, the old GPAs for not having lights on them, I put one in.
Yes, I know about the afterburner, and I'm too cheap to get one.
So I just use a bike light under my chin.
I have like a light shielding, but it sucks.
Next time you guys go BAAAAA in the middle of a great song like Daikon-Kai, just kill
yourself first.
Oh, shut up.
Hey, Anita's here.
Hey, Anita.
Okay, Nick.
Oh, hey, Anita's here, right, Anita?
Okay, Nick.
Fuck the judges for making me stop in the middle of my guacamole del taco routine.
I was, like, 95% of the way done.
Just because I was, like, failing my song.
You know what? Sorry to cut you off. I fucking agree with that.
You paid your money to be up there. It doesn't matter what other people think.
You paid your money. You should get to do your dance.
The gong is a stupid idea. And eat me.
Thank you.
I wish I had a dog.
Fucking single and fuck the whole thing.
And I agree with the whole crush thing.
It's a bitch.
Anyways, no, I got a few fucksies actually.
Yeah, fuck you to the judges for stopping you.
That pissed me off more than anything.
I wanted to get up and start hitting people, then I want to get sent home.
Fuck you to losing my voice after doing Orange Lounge all weekend last week.
I couldn't talk for like two days afterwards, but it was fun.
Zero's a hero!
Shush!
And uh, yeah, fuck you to the people who were making fun of the DDR Idol contestants because I really didn't see you guys get up there and do anything.
Yeah, let's see you get some balls!
Yeah, or something.
I'm so in love with you
Anyway, this is pointless. It's like microphone juggling. What?
Thanks Lizzie for bailing me out earlier, it saved my life
Yeah, fuck you to all those stupid bastards who pointed the fashion when I stumbled on a challenge that caused me to have a damn great day
Yeah, fuck you to all the blondes in Scandia, well the customer blondes that aren't us. Yeah, they're all fucking jackasses that need to just go live at RBGL for a month.
Um, yeah, fuck you being tired, and fuck you daylight time because I lost an hour.
And fuck you for Battle Royale, and here's the reason why.
We didn't see all the deaths. I wanted to see all of the apartment 40 deaths or whatever.
I wanted to see each and every one of you in detail.
How every one happened. Some of them you just hear they die.
Huh? No, I want to get it. And I want to get the script too.
And fuck you to trying to get your computer networked, because it never seems to happen.
Did they get that done yet? Networking to computers?
Okay, I'm done.
Angel's turn, is it?
Alright, I'd like to say, fuck you to jet lag, because I haven't been able to...
Hey, hey! Hi, Floor! Thank you. Oh, it got really crazy! How nice!
Alright, fuck you to Jetlag, because I haven't been able to get used to the time since I got back on Thursday.
I haven't been getting any sleep. Ask Rob, because he knows that I only got 25 minutes of sleep last night.
Well, wait, that doesn't help, because Black Lab, myself, and, uh, Dark Tetsuya, we're playing 2DX all night long, anyway.
Game on you.
Anyways, yeah, fuck you to Jetlag, and fuck you to, uh, Airplane Food, because it sucks.
Not all the time, but this time it sucks.
Alright.
Big major fuck you to Trapper Jam.
How the hell am I supposed to get from SACTO to Novato within 90 minutes if it's on a two-lane
road, 35 miles per hour, bumper to bumper?
That's why we were late.
Fuck you, dude, you're just a pussy-ass, Simon.
All of the judges, number one, were gonging DT.
Or two.
Simon actually passed me.
And then this whole time.
He just completely pushed out.
Oh, that's fine.
And I'm spinning.
All right, let's move on.
Yay.
Well, we have the chat room FUs, so let's get
to the chat room FUs.
OK, we have Justin wants to say, F you to Friday night.
No one at Scandia, and there was this girl playing DDR,
and I was playing with her, but she had no idea how to play.
And then I tried telling her, and she's like, well, I don't remember what she said.
Something in Spanish, because she didn't even speak English.
On a good note, I'm getting a free customized CD from LED Records, which is Judy Crystal,
Maria Shore, Priscilla, and Rose's producer.
And an F.U. to the troll lady I saw driving with missing teeth.
Ehh!
Ness151 would like to say a big, hearty F.U. to DDRCoralville for not giving free tokens,

going to protest Mr. Rogers' funeral. They're saying that Mr. Rogers is going to burn in

The other people that I want to go after with shotguns just because-

other than that, 2DX is awesome. It's not that hard. It didn't work. Hit the white key.
Then go to save. He did everything he said. I think it'll only work when you're playing

Yeah, just do it on the two player side.

All right, that is WildSide, who's—WildSide's been a pretty popular pick in the cage match
Wildside has been in the cage match quite a little bit lately. That was Queen of Love, and you might have recognized that as being Baek Hwa from 3rd Korean.
So, let's go around the room and see what everyone thought of Wildside, Queen of Love, starting with Puppy.
It sounded like the original version a lot. It's kind of a cool song, but I'd say a 7.5.
I think it's a big five, because it sucks, and I hate Wildside, and yeah, it sucked, the original was better, Wildside sucks, because they can't do any of their own songs, they just do covers and they suck ass, and PsyFam sucks as a piss-off baby.
Okay, so that kind of does its side, but I definitely have it just against the wild side.
I'll give it a four and a half. Angel?
Uh, it did sound like a lot, uh, a lot like the original, but, uh, I don't know, it was alright. I'd say four.
I like it because my Itoko sent it to me. It gets a 12.
But Quaz better, it really is, but it's not bad. I'd listen to that on a rainy day.
I'd, uh, I'd give it a... seven?
Okay. So. Alright, my pick.
Um, I was gonna pick a different song. I was gonna pick a song.
Okay, last night at a party, this guy, Garrett, who's new in town that plays 2D-
Well, he's not really new in town, actually. He's lived here his whole life.
But he kind of just is- he's new to the Sac-Bomani scene.
We saw him randomly playing 2DX one night, and we just kind of sucked him up into our little circle.
And, uh, turns out he owns a copy of Amplitude.
You haven't met him yet.
Alright, um, he has Amplitude.
He brought that over to the little shindig we had last night.
And there's a song on there I fuckin' love by Freezepop,
called Sup-
by, uh, it's called Supersprode by Freezepop.
However!
Can I talk- can I speak? Can I speak? Can I finish? Can I finish?
No. Anyway.
Uh, but I couldn't find a copy of Supersprode, which kinda sucks.
But I did find another song by Freezepop that kicks a lot of ass, so this is my cage match pick for this week.
This is Science Genius Girl, and this is my cage match pick from Freezepop, so enjoy!
I want the science fair
I wear a white black suit
Here they stand with my hair
When I close the human being
It will want to hold my hand
When I close the human being
It will be a member of my band
It will be, it will be
It will be a member of my band
Before I go to school
It will be a member of my band
Science is the method current, the theorems speak to me
Microscope is in my hand
Fun's welcome to a new screen
When I close a human being It will want to hold my hand
When I close a human being It will be a member of my band
It will be a member of my band
It will be the number of one hell
Measure out the chemicals, safety goggles on my eyes
Turn the vents and burner on, my creation comes alive
I have closed my human being, it is here and holds my hand
I have closed my human being, It is now a member of my band.
It is now a member of my band, It is now a member of my band.
My man, I am not a human being
It is you and not my man
My man, I am not a human being
It is now the number of my man
That's what it gets.
A weak burp for a weak tongue.
Not good, not good, not good.
Sorry Rob!
Okay, three.
I liked it except it was kinda making me fall asleep.
Whatever, whatever.
Okay, um...
I like...
Not your turn.
Now you're going last, so you can wait, Angel.
I really did like the beat, but, you know...
Okay, fine.
Six. Zero.
You know she just gave you that sportsy feel, dude.
no okay first of all i don't remember which fucking game that was from
i don't care i must i really must not have paid attention to that crappy ass
song okay i heard the fucking dwi to that and i
thought it was cool for like negative four seconds it was cool before
it started even though there was a dwi okay the best the best part about that
song was when it ended i gave it a negative 80 million
but don't worry rob though because you know that song that you were talking
It's not Wildside and it's not the Ketchum song. I'll give it a 6.5.
I mean and he would be better okay I just went this way I can see why it was
in frequency because it probably cost nothing to license that's it sucks major
ass so I'm giving it a 1 a 1 so I mean I know you people out there who just
vote against my song because you try to piss me off I don't care because I'll
come back stronger better faster oh yeah one last thing as for the previous song
I enjoy this song very well. I give it an 8.
I know this is really, really late and out of segment, but F you stupid AOL commercials, because I don't want to see an icon sleep with some ugly hoe. That's it.
Okay, as late as that comment was, I'll ignore it.
Of course, because AOL's got a spree anyway.
Yes?
Shut the hell up!
Speak!
that song owns freeze-pop owns you yes they do 10 I thought that song is pretty
good now like it on frequency so I give it an 8 now I give this a perfect score
and let me tell you why okay we I sat down I patiently listen to all your
bullshit and so you're gonna listen to me now okay first up freeze-pop science
Science Genius Girl, a band out of Boston. They're playing modern new wave music from the Electroclash school of style, okay?
They're mod-
These guys fucking own you for free.
This- no. Fuck you. Sit down.
I'm gonna wait. I'll wait. I'm gonna wait. Go ahead. I'm gonna wait.
Now check this out. Science Genius Girl is a brilliant composition.
It's a really well made new wave song. It's a really well made modern industrial pop song, okay?
The song is really cool, and it's fun. It's fun to play and make the game better and
Yeah, shut the fuck up. You're like. You don't know what the hell you're talking about anyways because you're like. Oh my god. It sucks
The thing is that okay, no hold on
You know what the only reason why you know all this shit about this band is because you have to make up for how much they
fucking suck
If they sucked I wouldn't care if they suck that you would care you're carried right now. They suck
Fuck! Listen to the song again!
I have like seven remixes, I have their album!
That's sad, did you find it like a five cent bin? Seriously!
Seven remixes what? They had to take seven fucking times to make it right?
You're a hoe man! You're a hoe!
Well at least I can go through with my mother!
Everyone shut up!
Your dog was better!
Thank you, now that you've all shut up...
I've never seen a case match get so fucking heated.
I just didn't like that one.
That's why I wanted to get a burp.
Rob, the ketchup song? What in the hell did I miss in five weeks?
Rob, do you have a hickey on your ass yet?
From that side of the room, you got a hickey on your ass.
Can we ask for the votes, please?
Alright, let's recap what you can vote for.
Oh my god.
Forgive me for liking people like Fisher, Booter, and Freefall, man. I go to clubs like that.
No one else gives a microphone!

Put your ass down in that chair and drink your goddamn tea.

It's a Final Fantasy quote. It's the best video game quote ever.
It's sin.
Dead air! Yay!
Sorry, I had to type that out for the chat rooms. I could see what they could move for.
Let's get a break so that, like, Sam first can calm down.
okay let's go to break there but it's going to be doing some yoga
it was interesting to know that i don't like turning into wonderland
work and is now
we let let lucky i'm sorry
yes i will bring up yet
yes
and i think
more than the pressing
they'll be
now i was going to talk about how hard
this uh... actually monday we have to put my dog down
all
yeah
She's not seven million years old, she was fourteen.
No.
No, we had to put my dog to sleep, so we buried her up in Placerville area, up at some lake
or something, and then between these trees we gave her her blanket, and...
Stop hitting me with your fucking keys!
And then we put her, like, bone and stuff in there, so that was kind of sad.
Alright.
At least you didn't take pictures like Oolong.
No, not that I'm aware of.
Good. I would be wondering about your sanity.
But I'm sorry about your dog.
That's alright.
For me, who doesn't like dogs, I liked your dog.
She was cool. But she was old and she was in pain, so we decided...
I mean, she didn't die naturally. We just took her to the vet to have her go to sleep because she was in pain.
She's been walking, her back legs are going paralyzed, and she had cysts all over the place, and probably cysts on the inside of her, and she was having trouble breathing, and all that wonderful stuff, so we're just like, okay, we're just gonna stay on it.
It was hard having to say goodbye to her, though, before I had to go to work.
Oh?
I had to say a final goodbye.
Sad.
Okay.
Well, okay, before we turn, now we've gone from Jerry Springer to Depression Hour.
Now it's Oprah.
Okay, but we're gonna play some, we're gonna cool down tempers by playing some mellow
songs. We're gonna play some mellow things. So, we will be back, and we're gonna play
a fun game when we come back. We're gonna play a game. Is it called Science genius girl
sucks? No, it's called... It's called, let's shove the mic up, Loki. No, no more! Hey,
Hey, nope, nope, hold on.
Alright, I want to see, I want to see a hug.
I want to see a hug.
I'm not going to break until we see a hug.
I want to see a hug.
Come on.
There we, aww, there we go.

the march madness tournament in sacramento is such a great success with
a special message to all those of you
that came out and participated. Next time, please don't make us clean up your blank.
All right.
Very simple answer, locked in.
Waiting on one more. Waiting on one more contestant.
Next time, please don't make us clean up your blank.
Mm, tastes like Korea.
Are all the contestants, are all the celebrities locked in?
Yes. Yeah? Oh, puppy's almost done.
Okay.
Puppy, you in?
He's writing, he's writing, he's writing, writing, writing, still writing, writing.
And, and, and he is almost done.
He's done. All right, there he goes. Put it down. All right.
Wait, did they send new answers?
Okay, fine.
Okay, here we go.
The contestants said,
The March Madness Tournament in Sacramento was such a great success,
but a special message to all those of you that came out and participated.
Next time, please don't make us clean up your snub.
This noise says, poop.
Please don't make us clean up your poop.
Skyline says, please don't make us clean up your crap.
Now, there is a difference between crap and poop.
Crap could be anything.
Crap could actually mean crap, or crap
could mean your stuff that you left running around.
Poop is pretty narrow.
There's only one thing that could be considered poop.
It depends.
Well, there's several animals that could have pooped.
But poop is poop.
crap could be poop, plus several other things, so I think Skyline has the edge on this, but
we'll see, we'll see. Let's go around and see the answers. Jamie, please next time,
don't make us clean up your... Blood from their jugular veins is their college
p0k3smot42o
I said, don't make us clean up your shitty shorts after the judges review a new one.
Shitty shorts after the judges review a new one. Isn't that lovely?
Lo and behold, will this be my answer? Don't make us clean up your crap.
Don't make us clean up your crap. You said crap. That is an exact match. An exact match with Skyline. Beautiful.
Now it's 2-0. Well, let's see if Snub Distantly can catch up here.
I said, please don't make us clean up your sweat.
Because you guys sweat a lot when you play DDR and you need to wear deodorant. Okay.
Alright.
So, two points for Skyline and no points for Snub.
But that's okay, Snub. Here's your chance. Here is your chance to catch up.
And you've been bitching about the Battle Royale references all night long.
Well, here you go. This last question is just for you to catch up.
Okay, here we go.
Jamie, I promised two questions about Jamie.
Jamie won the Bimani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night.
Her secret weapon was her blank.
Jamie won the Bamani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night.
Her secret weapon was her blank.
Snub, this is your last chance to catch up. Make it good.
Alright, we have one contestant locked in. Ooh, excellent answer, excellent, excellent
answer from that contestant. Too bad we're not as smart as the contestants.
the
okay fair enough good answer both people are all the celebrities locked in
as i
and shaimee here with my
big faggy arms
are you guys done? over here tag team?
suddenly angel is looking more and more attractive
I was just letting you know what you said.
I hate you just this once.
You just work like that much.
I hate you so much.
Oh, that hurt!
Meanie.
Alright, here we go, here we go.
Contestants, here we go.
Snub's gotta catch up, and here's his answer.
Jamie won the Bamani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night.
Her secret weapon was her remote collar exploder dealie.
Good answer.
Okay.
Jamie won the Bamani Battle Royale in Rob's living room last night.
Her secret weapon was her,
Skyline says,
Oh, he changed his answer. I think his first answer was better. He said orange bat, which
is a great answer, but he changed it. His new answer is boom stick. So we have remote
collar, exploder, dealie, and boom stick. Alright, Jamie, what's your answer?
Orange bat. Orange bat. I knew it too. That's right. You're
already in the lead, Skyline, you don't need it. Alright, as Snub goes, yes, I still have
a chance. Okay, our tag team, lovely tag team of Magus and Angel. Big black cock. Her big
black cock. Dun, dun, dun! Sorry, that's not a match. But funny, Puppy. The ferret! The
Good answer, but not a match.
Loki, her secret weapon was her...
Iraqi suicide babies.
Iraqi suicide babies.
Jamie, is this true?
I admit it, I've been exporting them.
I keep them in my trunk.
Alright, in your trunks. Dear God, what about the children? What about the children? Alright, moving on.
Uh, zero! Her paper plate. Her paper plate! The real answer!
The true one! And the magic marker.
Alright.
And the damn candlestick she jabbed me in the head with.
Alright. In the study with Colonel Mustard.
Here we go. Um, Dave, who's filling in for Shiva.
Yeah, her secret weapon was her extremely high-pitched voice.
No!
My carrot!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Shatter, shatter, shatter.
I'm surprised.
That reminds me of a story you told me earlier this week,
and I'm surprised it was not your nephew of the week.
You bitch!
All right.
Anyway, my answer, yeah, I got carrot.
For the record, Jamie does sound like a younger person on the phone.
Okay, fuck you. I have to get to that. I have to do another fuck you after this.
After the break.
But you know what? It just goes to show that looks can be deceiving.
Because she's pure evil.
Alright, my answer. Let's finish this damn thing up.
Only three people are going to get this joke, but I said Jamie won because of her cocksnacks.
Cocksnacks. Alright. Skyline, two points. Snub, zero points. Skyline
is the winner! Yay! And what does Skyline win, Jamie?
p0k3smot42o
can't speak to your mommy my response is fuck you you go die you motherfucker no
you can't talk to my mother and as like my number one pet peeve okay and so um
he's like what are you 12 is that anyway for a little girl to talk let us
it's your mother I'm like like oh yeah go to hell and opt me out and hung up on
Opt me out being the way that, you know, they don't call you back.
Those who don't know.
If you want to get rid of a telemarketer, ask them to help you out.
That was Story Time with Jamie, everybody.
Yay!
Normally, I'm really not that bad with telemarketers because, you know, Dan had to do that for
a little while.
Uh-huh.
And I'm really, I'm really patient with them usually, but that is my number one pet peeve
as people tell him.
You remember in Undersedation?
Mm-hmm.
Dude, all of you.
So you get to fuck YouTube, but not recently.
Hey, you should have done this to me.
Oh, hold on just one second.
Hi.
Uh, fuck yourself in.
Okay, I'll put it this way.
I know you guys hate telemarkers,
but I remember when I had to do telemarketing,
we hated more than you guys hate us having to do it.
It's totally tedious work, and it's stupid,
and people hate you because you have to call them
without your job, and it really sucks us.
He was rude, though.
Yeah.
Well, yeah, it was just like, you know, like, we hate doing it more than you guys hate us
calling you at six o'clock right when you're in the middle of dinner.
Like, the best time is when you're calling when people are saying grace for dinner, because
you'll hear Jesus Christ come out of their mouth.
It's the best thing ever.
No.
Or after they're done watching the ring.
Normally, like I said, I'm fine with telemarketers.
I'm normally, you know, just fine as I can be with them.
I don't sound like I'm twelve. I don't know how I sound like I'm twelve.
Even when I'm happy. Do I sound like I'm twelve when I'm happy?
Shut up, Robin.
I didn't say a goddamn thing. I'm just looking at you.
I'm gonna go now. I have to go back.
Jamie's gonna go make a gift, and in the meantime, we're gonna play some gifts for you.
When we come back, we're gonna talk to Jonas.
Because Jonas is here. Say hi, Jonas.
What up, yo?
And I think, Jamie, how about some Ask Orange Lounge, what do you think?
Why not?
I did not have that light switch installed so you could have a light switch rave.
Light switch rave!
When we come back, Ask Orange Lounge, and there's lots of people to ask tonight.
You can ask Sky, you can ask Loki, you can ask Dark Sakura, or you can ask DDR Angel,
Who's back from Japan?
You can ask 23rd Magus and DDR Angel if you are so inclined to ask a personal question.
Ask Puppy, ask Dark Tetsuya about what the rest of the routine would have been if those
fuckers hadn't pulled him off stage.
Ask Xerox about how much he hates that name.
Or you can ask Jonas about what he's going to be doing at Power Station.
Way to go, way to go.
There's a lot of frustration all the way.

You scare the monkey, you don't come in.
No, no, no. I'll just bring Shermy.
If Shermy doesn't like you, leave.
Proceeding, as always, was brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.
p0k3smot42o 1 less person i have to take home bye
can ask her about something she saw there. You can ask Angel and Megas personal questions.
You can ask Joe about his routine. You can ask Loki about why he's such a bastard. You
can ask Zero about Xerox or whatever. You can ask Anita about being cute.
I'd like to comment on her quote yesterday in the chatroom. It rules. You can read that
off by the way the quote was bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity also
I want to say hello to Jonas let's talk to Jonas for a bit while people are
submitting questions give it a minute Jonas how you doing okay we didn't get
to talk to you about the tournament how did how did you feel about it
March Madness first of all first of all I thought this was like the best term
I've ever been everything was all set up right especially for PA though some
Some people were complaining about having a 10-footer as like, do you know what he said
in his song?
Yep.
I think some people were complaining about putting naked no 10-footers.
The score was like the easiest 10-footer of all time.
You know what's interesting though is that the way Mike seeded is he didn't seed it just
by score.
Some people that screwed up their combos on bag and stuff got seeded lower.
If they got more than like 50 grades, he threw them in the bottom saying, you know what,
know what, don't do that shit, which is pretty cool.
How the fuck am I the upset king if I keep winning?
No, I'm just kidding I don't have an ego like that I I honestly eat both times
Both times was a huge surprise. There's a huge surprise
Oh, yes, my alter ego dr. Dick I know who I am. I know who I am
Do you know why the video is going to embarrass my mother?
That's obviously the video of the actual freestyle routine is out
But don't waste your time downloading it it sucks wait for the whole thing wait for the official videos that are gonna
Have the whole thing the introduction and the follow-up because the routine itself sucks shit although as I found out
Just moments ago. I came in seventh place dr. D
I should say dr. Dick came in seventh place which means if one of the top six flakes
I'm going to power station, and I have to do a freestyle
But we'll find out what your song is somehow.
And of course you may not want to improv it because this is an actual power station.
Now this is interesting though, is because does Dr. Dick have to do it, or can I do it?
That's the other question, do I have to do it as Dr. Dick?
Well I could be a two-faced person and say half-sky.
I don't know, I'm going to have to think about that. That's going to be kind of hard to...
Okay, half spanky, half dick.
to give a shout out to their tournament. I'm sure they did a fabulous DDR Magic 5. I've
got some results. They had a tech category and I'm sure it was insane. First place, GPF
Lift, surprise. Second place, Dancing Jedi. He's like the Tigger up there. You know he
wins the tournament. Oh, surprise. So that's why, ooh, if he comes to B3, which I hear
he is, it's going to be a great showdown. That's going to be beautiful. Oh, I'll wet
my pants all right third was unblinking eyes so congratulations top three in
tech there Oni first place was dancing Jedi second place was GPF lift and third
place was cynic good job you guys challenge now this is cool I am
surprised that the challenge competition has never been ripped off here in nor
Caleb just wait maybe maybe we'll rip that off the next actor but they do like
if you remember challenge from fourth makes an extra mix they do a competition
that's all like about that like how many goods can you get on this song or how
How many perfects can you get not looking at it or whatever, like all this crazy stuff
they do?
Oh yeah.
And it's interesting, but this is interesting because the Seattle tournaments, they're all
PA, there's no freestyle, because I guess they can't freestyle or whatever, I don't
know.
You never know.
They're going to prove us wrong at B3, I bet you anything, they're going to all put their
heads together and just give this kick-ass freestyle, they'll just put everything else
to shame.
You got people around the U.S. freestyling hella good, and they'll be from Omaha, they
from New York. Hell, it can happen.
First place in challenge was Krakoon.
Second place was Dancing Jedi.
And third place was Sinic.
Good job, you guys.
Alright, so that was the DDR Magic Tournament.
And I guess there was a tournament in Florida, and Tigger won a machine.
Yes, he did.
Nobody was paying attention to that tournament, so they don't give a shoutout.
I thought Tigger wasn't there.
If somebody can give me information on who plays in that tournament, I'll gladly read their names.
Okay, get to the Q&A!
Chat room's demanding we get to the Q&A.
Yes. Boost your questions, please.
We start with riceprincess.
Riceprincess wants to know what is DJ Taka's real name?
I don't know.
Actually, if you look in the DVR Max thing, his name is...
No, get the US DVR Max, it's in there.
She says she found out already, but we're challenging ourselves now.
Oh, riceprincess has it, but let's see if Loki can find it.
can find it now it's a game are we as smart as the chat room I have the
answer should I just Oh dark Tetsuya you know beautiful that's it that's what
rice princess has Takayuki Ishikawa beautiful angel says hi to rice princess
to by Joe thanks for coming
any final thoughts on your day all right thank you but I bet you didn't know that
that V was co-opted by DJ Taka and Antonio Vivaldi.
No, I kid you not, it's in the case notes.
Seeing as you know, Vivaldi is the classic piece
that is based off of.
Vivaldi's Winter?
Hello.
All right, all right, all right, here we go.
I slept with Mr. Brian once. Okay, here we go. Shh.
RicePrincess says, what is that white slab in my can of beans?
Pork. Pork. Fat.
The other white guy. The other white guy. I'm sorry, Zero?
It was the other guy who played, it was the other white guy who played Let the Beat Hit.
Sigh.
Okay. And she's warning us to look forward to Orange Crush in the future.
She's got some questions.
Vidpowah! Oh, Vidpowah's question was for DarkTetsuya and he left! Shit!
I'll answer it!
Okay, well this was it. It was DarkTetsuya, it was, this was a question from Vidpowah.
Why are you so awesome and why do you rule so much?
That's the question!
Yeah, it's rhetorical.
He just does.
Because he's influenced by Dark Sakura.
Yes, because we're his friends.
That's why he rules so much. That's the answer.
He rules so much because we're his friends.
Alright.
Snubdismoid says,
Why, in the name of God, did I have to get two greats on Never Let You Down?
Because you suck.
I'm kidding.
Uh, you got two greats, I'll never let you down because you weren't concentrating, and
next time your neck gets blown off.
Because you have to pee, and you can't PA when you have to pee.
Alright, Snubdicenoid also wants to say to Angel, did you get to ride the, and pardon
my white pronunciation of this, Shinca, woo, and I burped too, Shincansen, the bullet train,
did you get to ride the bullet train?
No, but my father and my friend did, on the way over to where we were.
That's cool. Did you get to see it? Did you get to hear him honk the horn?
Uh, no. We have little trains over there. They got to see, like, Hiroshima and, you know, uh, Mount Fuji, you know, all the little sites while they're going down, so...
Alright.
Except it took them, like, ten hours to get to where we were, so, yeah.
Alright. Oh, and Snubdissonoid says, you know what? Hey, Jamie, you know what? Snubdissonoid, he did have to pee. Amazing.
miss Cleo live in the house all right Justin would like to say how many people
would like these songs in full version and then he lists all these fucking
songs I'm not gonna read but there's a lot of Judy Crystal and Rose Judy and
Priscilla Maria short I'll be on tonight just yeah of course we want them you
fool send them rice princess has another great question have haven't any of you
You've seen Ren and Stimpy?
Of course!
There must have been a reference I missed.
It's all about the brand new episodes on TNN.
It's all about the brand new episodes on TNN.
Yes, that's right, they bought the rights for it and they're making new episodes.
This is amazing.
For the first time in my life, I watched SpongeBob SquarePants.
Never seen it, never will.
It's pretty fucking funny. I think you're missing out.
It's pretty funny. I was impressed.
Eat me.
You have got me watching Invader Zim now.
Oh.
Well, I've been downloading them.
RicePrincess says the correct answer to the bean question was,
it's the queen bean and the rest are worker beans.
I remember that.
Okay, that's it. I'm curious.
Questions for the two of us, please.
Oh, I'm sorry, what?
I don't know.
Next question?
I'm curious about what they would like to ask us if they want to ask us.
Well, here we go. I'm moving on. I'm moving on with more questions.
Cool.
Yo, SFBB, do you carry a pen with you everywhere?
No.
No, I don't.
I do.
I don't need to. I always borrow my pen from Jamie.
My pen is also a glow stick.
Oh, dear.
I carry the penis, my dear.
Because the penis, my dear.
I like to be the first on the show to say that I outright boycott any more Battle Royale
references in the show.
It was funny, no it wasn't even funny the first time, I let it slide because it was
kind of cute.
Second time was slightly less cute but still cute nonetheless, kind of funny, a few different
references are cute. It's done. You killed the joke.
If you have any questions about Battle Royale, ask the dictionaries. Jamie and I.
VidPowah. Second question from VidPowah. I'm so confused. What exactly is this Bimani Battle
Royale that you keep talking about?
Battle Royale is a movie. Go to battleroyalonline.com and it's the best movie ever.
And imagine a bunch of us just flipping around the livery room throwing paper plates at each
each other, stabbing each other with candles in the eye.
Sorry, I didn't hit you in the eye.
I can break this down very easily.
What happens when a bunch of six-year-olds
watch the Power Rangers?
What happens after that?
They all pretend that they are Power Rangers.
And they pretend, you know, I'm the red one, I'm the pink one.
And they beat each other up, you know, pretend.
And then they pretend that they're transforming
and stuff like that.
Shut up, Dave.
Anyway, that's what happened.
We watched Battle Royale.
And then suddenly a bunch of six-year-olds
were running around my living room playing Battle Royale,
cutting each other with paper plates, strangling each other with tape. It was beautiful. And
that was the Bomani Battle Royale.
And that's when I got knee-dropped into Rob's coffee table by zero.
Nothing will uh...
Actually I pushed her and she just kind of fell, but I didn't knee-drop her, she knee-dropped
herself.
I think the greatest fuck-up all day was Loki doing a caution drop on Max, too.
one that wasn't a caution drop in number two I had actually put the freeze there
for that purpose but the problem is is pulling the freeze in the back of your
hands when you do like a drop like that you can't hold it down so there's not
enough weight you can't get your like torso up high enough so that all your
weights on your hands I should have that knee drop but yeah I couldn't get back
up because I'm fat I want to see someone hold two freeze arrows on the diagonals
with each of their asscheeks. Just have like one on the left and one on the right and be
able to hold it. As Rob looks at me and his eyebrow twitches. Alright, let's move on.
Snubdistanoid says, Does anyone in the studio have a Gameboy Advance SP? I got one and safe
to say, it rocks my cocks. First of all, those things hurt my hand, and I have an afterburner
in my GBA, so I own you. Uh, I want an afterburner in my GBA, I don't need a Gameboy SP if I
get an afterburner. Does anybody have one? Nope. Question, he has more than one? I read
bit wrong, but cock doesn't rhyme with rocks. So I had to say cocks, it's just natural.
Okay, uh, one of our chatroom frequenters, if you ever run into him, his name is BigRedPimp.
Um, he does have an SP, so if you want, like, you know, info on it, just ask him.
No, see? See, wait, wait, hold on. Let me just say it. Court.
There's a person in here whose fiance works for GameStop, hello.
No, okay.
I'm bad Jamie. I'm bad Jamie.
I'm bad Jamie.
Hold on, let me speak. Zero.
Go ahead.
Let me just say that Corey probably bought one, and he probably got two others just from getting them.
Okay, the SP is like the worst idea ever. I mean, it's cool that it's compact, but it does hurt your hands.
And if you have big hands, that's just gonna hurt you too.
And it just looks kinda cool, but stupid at the same time.
shoulder buttons are the most retarded I know they're like in the crease of the
screen it's a that's going on my video game review oh yeah but check it out I
know how small the GBA is GBA SP but look you can play with one hand like
squeezing a book you look like you're squeezing a boob
Or rocking your own cocks.
I am good at it.
The only game that does not work on SP is Kirby's Tilt and Tumble.
Because you have to rock the Game Boy.
And of course, up equals down, left equals right if you play the game.
just do yourself a favor, get a used GBA and get an afterburner
these people that are buying these SPs are the same people that bought the Gameboy, then the Gameboy Pocket, then the Gameboy Color, then the Gameboy Advance, then all the SPs
you stupid bastards, do you realize they just milked five systems out of you?
Haha, I laugh at you ass. I've only bought the Gameboy and now I'm going to buy the SP
SP customers are the ones who bought virtual boys and enjoyed them
I bought a virtual boy and enjoyed it and I don't have an SP
We got a virtual boy when Hollywood was clearing them out. So we have like the nice plastic case
No, actually to be perfectly honest when the game when the Gameboy Pocket came out
It was a massive improvement over the regular Gameboy because it was clearer
But I love my Game Boy Color, and I still use it for one thing, DDRTV2.
Oh yeah.
No, the ones who bought SPs are probably the same ones who bought game comms.
Anyway.
Okay, I got a game comm for five bucks.
When Toys R Us is carrying them out.
Moving on.
I own 42 video games, just console.
Hello.
Okay.
Justin.
Justin circuit is asking us a bunch of questions here

you ever AAA'd a heavy song? Have I ever AAA'd a heavy song? Just this week, I AAA'd La Copa
Davido, which is my first AAA Heavy on Extreme, I should say, because I did a few on 4th Mix

Oh, that's cool.

Awesome.
That was like when I played Superstar every game I ever played.

It's not so much a question.
I have an accomplishment I wanted to announce.

Yay!
It was a...
What is it?
Beauty of Silence.
No, wait.
I forget what song it was. It was, it was, no, it was Beauty of Silence or...
I think it was, oh, I can't remember. I'll remember it.
But it was, it was Full Combo. Yay! I have one too!
I passed three other 2DX songs today.
Yay! Gotta start somewhere. Full Combo too!
Chat Room says, Dave, because he's insane, just look at him for the battle royale.
I think I'd kick his ass. Alright.
Shadow would like to clarify, Shadow would like to clarify, I haven't a clue but you're
not around.
Alright, Snub would like to say, on sackbamani.com who is deleted member and what happened?
Oh god, you had to bring this up.
Okay, our hosts suck a big ball of shit.
What happened is that some of our files started getting either deleted or zeroed out, which
means all the content in them was deleted.
So threads are gone, members are gone, there's no rational explanation for it, it's just
their servers deciding to fuck with our files.
What?
You know I thought it was a quota thing but it's not because it's still letting me upload
new files.
It's the wild monkey they have controlling the server there.
Delete.
Delete.
Delete.
Delete.
Delete.
Don't ever use onedollarhosting.com, they suck big balls.
But the press said yes!
Moving on.
We're working on a backup plan as we speak.
I'm going to make forums.
I don't know how, but I will.
Another show of hands for Justin, please.
Another show of hands.
Here we go.
How many people like Cup of Child?
Cup of Child, anybody?
Three?
Four.
Okay, four.
Okay.
Okay. Last question, gang. Last question. This is a good one. We can go around the room
and ask everyone this. This one comes from Vidpowah. And Vidpowah would like to know
from everybody, and everybody's experienced enough with this game now, what is your favorite
2DX video? Let's go around. Let's go around. Starting with Jamie, or you want to go last?
What else? Stoic.
I was gonna say the same thing, stoic.
Okay, um, wow wow 70s because where else does like broccoli have an afro along with skyscrapers and all this other cool stuff that sends out afro rays and triple A's the world with afros. It's just cool.
Go afro.
Um...
I'll have to say, I like Bad Routine, that's pretty good.
Yeah, Bad Routine is a guy dancing, or Dancer's pretty good.
But, if you want to go with iCandy, you can't be Last Message, because there's giant breasts.
Oh yeah.
Rob Lick Boots today.
I would probably say my favorite one is, and people will laugh at me about this, but the Calcutta video, because Dr. Bombay is my hero and he owns you and second best is SOS, but if you get SOS you have to get the full video on Kazal.
This is probably really generic and everybody's favorite, but I have to say Alien World because it's got the cool little alien puppet doll thingies.
Alien World gave me nightmares the first time I saw it. I had a dream of weird alien people coming to kill me. I'm done.
Alright, Angel made a decision, finally. I chose B because, well, yeah, it turns out that one too.
I can't believe I didn't think about this.
The best one has to be, uh, one of the best ones has to be, uh, Gradius Cyber.
Yeah, Gradius Cyber.
I was like, I thought I was changing my mind. I was thinking about using, thinking about slag work.
Mmm. Burning Heat?
For me, I have a couple. One of them is definitely a Sweet Lab.
Because it's so cute.
But my overall favorite one, actually I really like Burning Heat because it's also Gradius 2, which is one of my favorite shooter games ever.
I love the little thingies walking around with the little sign that says,
WIN!
The beeps!
Jelly kiss.
Whatever.
My favorite, I have a serious favorite and a fun favorite.
Well, I have a couple serious favorites.
Okay, then my overall.
Okay, my favorite videos.
Reincarnation.
Yes.
Good, good, good.
Dancer.
Good, good, good.
And then my favorite 2DX video of all time, and a lot of people forget about this one,
this one, but it honestly is the most kick-ass 2DX video they ever did, because they cut
it after a couple styles were set. Sometime. Sometime is the best 2DX video.
No, Route 80s. Route 80s is, like, the best one ever.
You know, the best one is Nothing Ain't Stopping Us.
Funky Bingo Paradise. Because you can't beat the boogie dancers.
It's freakin' Funky Bingo Paradise. Wait, wait, wait. I gotta add another one,
just because it's all about us. It's all about Love Is Orange.

it's time for the final thoughts the show's over and i've got to get the
fuck outta here right it's nine thirty hits so
Let's go around and get final thoughts.
You want to go around the room again?
Start with Magus.
All right, start with Magus.
Final thought, please.
And whee!
Angel.
I'll grab the mic later.
I'll grab the mic later.
All right, Dave.
Xenon sucks.
I'm not a tool.
And I will hopefully be able to go to B3 and do awesome.
New CBS update for Step Manias, came out on the 27th, that's pretty good, then there's also my site, since my site right now is up, and has all the DDR extreme and everything, pretty much every single official sim file out there I have, and DDR UK is down right now, and single width Bemani cell is down, so my server is the only place you can get them, too bad I haven't updated my pages to tell you how to get it.
My page is the hell you had to get it.
Also, I may suck at freestyling, but how far did the judges get in PA?
Also, next week I will have a video game review prepared with the help of Darkchild, who will also be helping me out with that. I'm done.
This is the girl that has no voice.
I don't know what to say except Ra Moon is the best drink in the world and that's about
it.
Yay!
Everybody have fun.
Hi to all my friends out there.
Everybody.
What?
I guess I have no friends.
Shereequah.
Okay.
I'm done.
I'm done.
Random quote, random quote.
Dude, what was that shirt that had Sinead, Martin?
It had Sinead in it.
Angel, your final thought?
Topo is white and squishy, but I don't know if Magus is white.
Magus is white, but I don't know if he's squishy.
Blink.
You don't need to know this.
Blink, blink.
Look at the quote from the chat room.
Check the top.
Jonas.
I know, final thoughts.
I'll be making a one, I'll be making a D-Direct file that's
I'm gonna be in the next tournament whenever it comes out.
Oh well.
And, you're a freak that needs to stop having those blood viruses that, you know, cause you know, cause you know, you know the sacri- the sacri-
I'm a Sacramento marshman that's on thread.
Sometimes the spaces get, um, are off.
And I know I'm two hours late, but F you to really bad April Fools pranks.
There's a lot of people that tried stupid pranks and you can see right through them and we call them on it and we ruin their fun.
Okay, I don't know how so many people fell for mine.
I said I was moving to Seattle.
There's some things you don't joke about. Because there's some things you just don't joke about.
p0k3smot42o I've never heard an implementable joke that I was able to pull off
My final thought is, um, uh, why don't you give me a sign?
Never mind. Angel?
I didn't have my final thought.
Oh, Jamie?
My final thought is, I want ice cream.
The system is down.
Suck me one of your rules and I want to do this again.
And again.
Okay, I'll shut up.
Seriously, I want ice cream.
For my birthday, give me the Battle Royale novel.
April 19th.
No, I won't tell you how old I will be.
You get the very final word, Jamie. What is it?
I guess.
Die!
