00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
The Monty Talk and then some.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000

Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.280
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

00:32.280 --> 00:36.000
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex. In this episode...

00:36.000 --> 00:42.800
Hey, are there any balls down there?

00:42.800 --> 00:45.500
That's the biggest berry you've ever seen, Jingleberry.

00:45.500 --> 00:48.500
What's your favorite scary movie?

00:48.500 --> 00:52.400
Showgirls. Absolutely frightening. What's yours?

00:52.400 --> 00:54.900
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

00:54.900 --> 00:57.700
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.

00:57.700 --> 01:00.700
Now's the time on sprockets, then we dodge!

01:00.700 --> 01:04.200
I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog, too!

01:04.200 --> 01:05.700
I don't cook food.

01:05.700 --> 01:08.200
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

01:08.200 --> 01:10.700
Why did they have to take the word gay?

01:11.700 --> 01:15.700
Oh, what I expect from a Spanish expression is gentle.

01:15.700 --> 01:18.200
Hey, hey, hey!

01:19.700 --> 01:23.700
Shut up! Where's my gun? This is my boom stick.

01:24.700 --> 01:26.700
Come on, girls, it's time to drop the bomb.

01:26.700 --> 01:30.700
I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.

01:30.700 --> 01:33.700
What kind and what human being would find that funny?

01:33.700 --> 01:38.700
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:38.700 --> 01:41.700
We are live, but not really.

And this is episode number 42 for April the 27th of 2003.

01:46.700 --> 01:52.700
You're tuned into the Bimani Scene's most premeditated radio station of all things Bimani.

01:52.700 --> 01:55.700
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky.

01:55.700 --> 02:00.700
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Ms. Jamie Summers.

02:03.700 --> 02:08.700
Or tonight, as her name tag says, Ms. Pac-Man.

02:08.700 --> 02:10.700
I like your shirt. That's a cool shirt.

02:10.700 --> 02:13.700
It's retro.

02:13.700 --> 02:18.700
Loki is out today because he's doing stuff.

02:18.700 --> 02:20.700
He broke his track record again.

Mr. Random person on the street, who by the way is not an actor, what do you think of

07:34.080 --> 07:36.400
the Orange Don't play money music in more shows?

07:36.400 --> 07:43.920
The music is like being transported to this dancing spaceship place.

07:43.920 --> 07:50.200
It's unearthly, it's like being in a club, except you don't have to ask someone to dance.

07:50.200 --> 07:54.040

Oh, no joke.

08:59.900 --> 09:02.900
Finally, I've been in the intro for a long time.

09:02.900 --> 09:03.900
Who?

09:03.900 --> 09:04.900
I think who.

09:04.900 --> 09:05.900
Who?

09:05.900 --> 09:10.900
What was it I was watching that had the monkey jacking off?

09:10.900 --> 09:13.900
Well, Conan O'Brien has the masturbating bear.

09:13.900 --> 09:20.900
No, it was I think a video tape of these people at the zoo and the monkey was Lincoln.

09:20.900 --> 09:22.900
They show that on cable or something

09:29.900 --> 09:32.380
Oh my god, I watched the blue girl live-action

09:33.100 --> 09:38.260
Love blue girl live-action. God. It was horrible describe a blue girl for the uninitiated

10:38.260 --> 10:43.820
Today, we're painting on Orange Lounge Radio.

10:43.820 --> 10:45.820
We're going to make a happy cloud.

10:45.820 --> 10:53.100
Fluffy white clouds of cocaine.

10:53.100 --> 11:02.920
I was so sad when Bob Ross died.

11:02.920 --> 11:06.180
What other people have died recently that made me go,

11:06.180 --> 11:07.180
Mr. Rogers?

11:07.180 --> 11:08.180
Oh, Nell Carter.

11:08.180 --> 11:09.180
She was cool.

11:09.180 --> 11:10.180
Shut up.

11:10.180 --> 11:11.180
I like Nell Carter.

11:11.180 --> 11:12.180
She was cool.

11:12.180 --> 11:13.180
Are you still watching?

11:13.180 --> 11:14.180
Give me a break.

11:14.180 --> 11:15.180
Give me a break.

11:15.180 --> 11:16.180
Oh.

11:16.180 --> 11:29.700
So, yeah, interesting week for us.

11:29.700 --> 11:33.780
I think we've all just been very busy and doing random sorts of things.

11:33.780 --> 11:35.780
It's been like a crazy week for me.

12:03.780 --> 12:09.780
It's multi-purpose. You can clip it anywhere. You can clip it on your nipple if you wanted to.

12:09.780 --> 12:14.780
I have these shelves that are over my computer desk where we keep our old school stuff.

12:14.780 --> 12:19.780
Not a nipple clamp lamp, bleh.

12:19.780 --> 12:23.780
It's a tongue twister, nipple clamp lamp.

12:23.780 --> 12:25.780
That's the new Erotic song, isn't it?

12:25.780 --> 12:28.780
Yes, the new Erotic single, nipple clamp lamp.

12:28.780 --> 12:32.780
Yeah, it's the B-side to temple of butt.

12:32.780 --> 12:52.780
You know what's interesting is that Dark Tetsuya, who's an obsessive listener of this show, pointed out in the chat room a while back that actually in an earlier episode, and he cites episode 12, I apparently actually said something about Mr. Rogers is not dead, or something like that. I don't remember the exact quote.

12:52.780 --> 12:53.780
Yeah, at that point Mr. Rogers is not dead.

12:53.780 --> 12:55.780
Yeah, at that point Mr. Rogers is not dead. This is funny that we brought it up on the show.

12:55.780 --> 13:06.780
By the way, and I appreciate our listeners, but when you remember episode numbers, you've got this time that you need to go on vacation.

13:06.780 --> 13:11.780
Well, if I remember right though, episode 12 was the second episode we broadcast this week.

13:11.780 --> 13:14.780
Okay, but I haven't been keeping up with episode 12.

13:14.780 --> 13:18.780
I haven't either, but I think episode 12 was...

13:18.780 --> 13:24.780
Dear people, if you refer to a specific event, don't refer to it by episode number because we sure as fuck don't remember.

13:24.780 --> 13:25.780
Do you remember Episode 3?

13:25.780 --> 13:26.780
No.

13:26.780 --> 13:27.780
Oh my God, I wasn't here.

13:27.780 --> 13:28.780
Yeah, you weren't here.

13:28.780 --> 13:35.020
I remember that, because I remember when Orange Lounge Radio started, you were here the first

13:35.020 --> 13:36.020
week.

13:36.020 --> 13:37.020
We had everybody here the first week.

13:37.020 --> 13:40.020
And then the second and third week, it was like, I'm going to Anime Expo, bye.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.020
That was it, too.

13:42.020 --> 13:48.080
I was like, um, I'm in L.A., bye, I'm in San Diego, bye.

13:48.080 --> 13:50.580
And then we were just kind of here without Jamie for a couple weeks.

13:50.580 --> 13:52.580
And then I went to Alabama, bye.

13:52.580 --> 13:59.580
I don't know. I second traffic in San Francisco. I don't think what did the show was Alabama, but I don't know them happen before

14:02.380 --> 14:04.380
June 23rd

14:05.900 --> 14:09.740
Yeah, but I was stuck in traffic in San Francisco one time I remember that too yeah

14:09.740 --> 14:13.340
Hey, you were not were like next door. Yeah, we're going back in

14:13.340 --> 14:18.340
kostjamrh Who else would have a higher end?

14:43.340 --> 14:51.720
And sometimes, even when we're not having a show, I take Michael and Neil home.

14:51.720 --> 14:56.000
I do fuck off all the time, so maybe I have the highest attendance after all, because

14:56.000 --> 15:00.300
I attended my own home.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.560
I work from home.

15:01.560 --> 15:02.560
You work from home.

15:02.560 --> 15:03.560
I see.

15:03.560 --> 15:04.560
Seriously.

15:04.560 --> 15:07.500
So, God, what else is new this week?

15:07.500 --> 15:11.980
It's such an interesting show tonight, because there's just nothing to talk about.

15:11.980 --> 15:19.160
I know aren't you excited about tonight's show listeners. I know how to get you excited good

15:19.160 --> 15:22.300
I'll load some porn. It's funny. Let's just get drunk. That'll be funny

15:22.900 --> 15:24.900
I'm just kidding. I know I actually

15:28.620 --> 15:34.420
Pretend we're getting drunk, and then then if the show is really bad because we're lagging we can just say we're drunk. We were drunk. Sorry

15:35.820 --> 15:39.740
Jamie'll get drunk, and I'll get high and then you'll be sober, so they don't have all festival over

15:39.740 --> 15:44.980
I don't know why don't I huh you can get drunk you can get high and I'll have sex

15:47.420 --> 15:49.420
I'll be in the other

15:51.900 --> 15:53.900
We need to have we need

15:55.060 --> 16:01.140
We need a black person we need our we need either an Asian or a Pacific Islander

16:02.820 --> 16:04.820
We need to have

16:04.820 --> 16:06.820
Yeah, we need the person with bad hygiene.

16:06.820 --> 16:08.820
We need everybody to hate somebody else.

16:08.820 --> 16:10.820
We need the racist.

16:10.820 --> 16:12.820
And the racist has to be a roommate.

16:12.820 --> 16:14.820
We have Loki.

16:14.820 --> 16:16.820
We have Loki.

16:16.820 --> 16:18.820
I don't know where Loki is tonight.

16:18.820 --> 16:20.820
He just said he wouldn't be available tonight.

16:20.820 --> 16:22.820
I think he's either fapping

16:22.820 --> 16:26.820
or he's probably getting ready for the moving on Saturday

16:26.820 --> 16:28.820
which is one reason we're taped tonight.

16:28.820 --> 16:32.820
Maybe he's having special time with us.

16:32.820 --> 16:38.060
Who has time for relationships?

16:38.060 --> 16:47.060
I sure don't.

16:47.060 --> 16:52.300
Well there is a little bit of news, actually there's a lot of news, we're just being lazy.

16:52.300 --> 16:54.740
We're procrastinating for next week.

16:54.740 --> 16:58.200
Who said we'd bring you news timely?

16:58.200 --> 17:00.800
You know I realize we kind of lied last week.

17:00.800 --> 17:05.880
We said that last week was the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio from this studio, but

17:05.880 --> 17:08.280
we're actually in the studio tonight.

17:08.280 --> 17:13.920
Tonight's the last episode in the studio, even though we're pre-taped.

17:13.920 --> 17:14.920
I'm confused.

17:14.920 --> 17:15.920
I just went cross-eyed.

17:15.920 --> 17:16.920
Yeah.

17:16.920 --> 17:17.920
I want ice cream.

17:17.920 --> 17:18.920
Let's go get ice cream.

17:18.920 --> 17:19.920
Fuck this show.

17:19.920 --> 17:20.920
Bye.

17:20.920 --> 17:21.920
I had salad today.

17:21.920 --> 17:22.920
Did you?

17:22.920 --> 17:23.920
From where?

17:23.920 --> 17:24.920
The grocery store.

17:24.920 --> 17:25.920
Did you toss your salad?

17:25.920 --> 17:26.920
Yes, I did actually.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.920
It landed on the cat.

17:29.920 --> 17:34.920
You know what's funny? I had a salad today, too, and I shook my salad.

17:38.920 --> 17:47.920
Alright, one interesting thing that's in Bamani News this week. DanceMania EX3 just came out, and I don't have a copy, and I want one. So somebody get me one.

17:47.920 --> 17:49.920
What the fuck's on this one this time?

17:49.920 --> 17:52.920
Get this. Ace of Base, first track. How cool is that?

17:52.920 --> 17:54.920
C.A.R.I.M.I.E.M.I.E.C.H.

18:52.920 --> 18:54.920
The only way I remember that song is through Moulin Rouge.

18:55.920 --> 18:56.920
I've never seen it.

18:56.920 --> 18:59.920
I know. You've never seen Moulin Rouge. We've got to make you watch that sometime.

18:59.920 --> 19:04.920
But there's this part where they, you know, they're going back and forth between all these love songs, and then there's that part where

19:04.920 --> 19:08.920
I was made for loving you, baby, you were made for loving me.

19:08.920 --> 19:11.920
I should never sing on this show.

19:11.920 --> 19:13.920
Yes.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.920
In the fight.

19:16.920 --> 19:20.920
Any other fun Dance Mania albums coming out that we should give a mention to?

19:20.920 --> 19:21.920
Nah, don't look like it.

19:51.920 --> 20:01.920
It's Castlevania, and get this, the new Castlevania is coming out, and look at that, it's 3D.

20:01.920 --> 20:03.920
Come on, Castlevania dungeon.

20:03.920 --> 20:04.920
Yes.

20:04.920 --> 20:09.920
Okay, wait a second, but the last time they tried to do a 3D Castlevania game, it sucked shit.

20:11.920 --> 20:12.920
This is new.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.920
Yeah, it was up yesterday.

20:16.920 --> 20:18.920
Okay, you know what?

20:18.920 --> 20:28.920
But this is what it says at the bottom, it says the article says this game will be entirely in 3D, but is not intended to be like Castlevania 64, which the producer openly admitted to hating.

20:28.920 --> 20:32.920
The game takes place in the 11th century apparently, but other story details are pretty vague.

20:32.920 --> 20:34.920
God damn it, they need to do another one with Richter.

20:34.920 --> 20:39.920
Everybody pray to whatever god you believe in that this game does not suck, please.

20:39.920 --> 20:44.920
They need another game with Richter.

20:44.920 --> 20:45.880
or as

20:45.880 --> 20:52.880
uh... maria said in english

21:03.560 --> 21:05.780
you know you're getting another

21:05.780 --> 21:06.620
what's that

21:06.620 --> 21:08.080
freaking gradius five

21:08.080 --> 21:10.800
what's that about

21:10.800 --> 21:13.700
it's new

21:13.700 --> 21:16.260
Gradius 5 on the PS2.

21:16.260 --> 21:18.260
On the piece of shit too.

21:18.260 --> 21:19.260
Sorry.

21:19.260 --> 21:21.620
Oh it is.

21:21.620 --> 21:22.620
Now-

21:22.620 --> 21:30.380
Just because they took parts out of old space shuttles and stuff to make this thing doesn't

21:30.380 --> 21:31.380
mean it's not accessible.

21:31.380 --> 21:34.460
I just think people can't program for it for shit or else we would definitely have games

21:34.460 --> 21:40.260
that looked better.

21:40.260 --> 21:46.460
Metal Gear Solid 2 was nice, but it was better on Xbox, I have to say, because there was

21:46.460 --> 21:47.460
more room for anti-aliasing.

21:47.460 --> 21:58.060
That's why I like the new substance on PC, because it's just as good as your system is.

21:58.060 --> 22:01.060
If you've got the best card in the world, it'll look better than anything you've got.

22:01.060 --> 22:02.060
You know what?

22:02.060 --> 22:05.060
Tekken 3 and Metal Gear Solid on Bling Bling.

22:05.060 --> 22:06.060
Bling Bling.

22:06.060 --> 22:07.060
That was really good.

22:07.060 --> 22:16.060
Rob is off, you know, scratching his head.

22:37.060 --> 22:44.060
so i really have no interest in u.s ps2 games

22:44.920 --> 22:46.560
i've already seen the ending

22:46.560 --> 22:48.740
shhh no spoilers

22:48.740 --> 22:51.440
you could just get a mod chip and you know

22:51.440 --> 22:52.460
why

22:52.460 --> 22:56.120
because any other game that's going to come out after that is not going to work

22:56.120 --> 22:59.000
okay i used to say that when the ps2 just came out because it's

22:59.000 --> 23:02.600
understandable you know it just came out but now ps2 is kinda

23:02.600 --> 23:04.780
it's starting to become the end of its life and

23:04.780 --> 23:08.300
all the best games that are out I mean so how about when you if you mind your

23:08.300 --> 23:12.020
system now and then seventh style comes out and it won't work with your system

23:12.020 --> 23:14.660
then I'll go buy seventh style

23:14.660 --> 23:16.980
I mean seventh style will work as a

23:16.980 --> 23:20.160
purchased version I don't need to take pictures of it to play it

23:20.160 --> 23:24.700
and seventh style won't come out

23:24.700 --> 23:28.340
I've heard that before about you know that the

23:28.340 --> 23:30.380
you get the mod chip and then

23:30.380 --> 23:33.840
sony could release a game that would basically fuck up your mod chip or not or you

23:33.840 --> 23:37.840
You know, they override the computation, kind of like they did with the early chips on the PS1.

23:37.840 --> 23:39.840
Sony was even doing it right to the end of the Playstation's line.

23:39.840 --> 23:45.840
Right. And what's interesting about that is what they could do with it is they could do it through online purposes.

23:45.840 --> 23:54.840
It's possible, you know, if your PS2 is online, you go online with Final Fantasy XI, and then sneak sneak, it's updating your BIOS.

23:54.840 --> 23:58.840
That's why I just will play on the computer, because it's coming out for computer in America.

23:58.840 --> 24:11.840
By the way, if anyone is interested in that, if you go to squareenixusa.com, you can submit an application to beta test Final Fantasy XI for PC or for PS2.

24:11.840 --> 24:14.840
I really hope they choose me for beta testing.

24:14.840 --> 24:18.840
Please, please Square, I've played your game since the beginning.

24:18.840 --> 24:23.840
I'm more than positive I'm going to get selected because I've done game beta testing before.

24:23.840 --> 24:26.840
I played Ragnarok online, ew.

24:26.840 --> 24:31.840
Yeah, that sucks they didn't continue that over here because I really want to play Ragnarok.

24:31.840 --> 24:33.840
They're still in beta testing right now.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.840
Yeah, but it's like they're only working with...

24:35.840 --> 24:37.840
The paid release is going to be out I think for the next couple months.

24:37.840 --> 24:39.840
And they are going to America with it?

24:39.840 --> 24:41.840
Because it sounded like they were neglecting America.

24:41.840 --> 24:44.840
They have an American beta test open right now.

24:44.840 --> 24:48.840
Well, I mean, it's closed, it's a closed beta, but they have it going on right now.

24:48.840 --> 24:50.840
I know it's been talked about on here, but for those who don't know,

24:50.840 --> 25:00.840
ragnorockonline.com

25:20.840 --> 25:22.340
It was about the closest you can get.

25:22.340 --> 25:25.340
It's like, it's like Secret of Mana with Final Fantasy Tactics type jobs and things.

25:25.340 --> 25:28.340
And you can beat up ants and grasshoppers that play the fiddle.

25:28.340 --> 25:31.340
Fucking fiddle playing grasshoppers.

25:31.340 --> 25:35.340
I don't know if you've seen it, but PopCap.com, they're the folks that make like Bejeweled

25:35.340 --> 25:39.340
and all those like really addicting little web games that people play online.

25:39.340 --> 25:41.340
Oh, it's pretty addicting.

25:41.340 --> 25:44.340
Atomica, you probably haven't played any of those games, huh?

25:44.340 --> 25:47.340
Well, PopCap's the company that makes all those games, they have a new game on their site

25:47.340 --> 25:53.740
kind of like you know it's a multiplayer ish type game which is online world type

25:53.740 --> 25:58.460
thing which at first look at kind of you know just first instinct was oh it's like

25:58.460 --> 26:03.380
a 3d Ragnarok kind of thing but it's it still needs a lot of tweaking but it's

26:03.380 --> 26:07.940
interesting it's worth checking out the popcap comments because free I think if

26:07.940 --> 26:14.840
you pay money you get special things but hey I'm still doing Neopets okay I have

26:14.840 --> 26:17.840
I have not checked on my Neopet in two weeks, damn thing's probably dead.

26:17.840 --> 26:18.840
Give me all your money.

26:18.840 --> 26:20.840
I don't want to give you my money.

26:20.840 --> 26:23.840
If you love your pet, give me your money.

26:23.840 --> 26:24.840
Why?

26:24.840 --> 26:28.840
So that I can get up to 500,000 Neopets.

26:28.840 --> 26:30.840
I think I have like 25,000.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.840
That's actually about what I need.

26:32.840 --> 26:33.840
Really?

26:33.840 --> 26:34.840
Mwahaha.

26:34.840 --> 26:37.840
Seriously, I've been trying to get up to...

26:37.840 --> 26:39.840
Is that like the last level of saving?

26:39.840 --> 26:40.840
No.

26:40.840 --> 26:41.840
Oh.

26:41.840 --> 26:42.840
That's about three on it.

26:42.840 --> 26:47.920
to upgrade to my next bank account.

26:47.920 --> 26:50.480
OK, why don't we take ourselves a quickie little break.

26:50.480 --> 26:51.080
We're going to come back.

26:51.080 --> 26:52.680
We're going to talk about Max 2.

26:52.680 --> 26:54.960
Max 2, Japan, came out this week.

26:54.960 --> 26:57.800
And there's been some interesting early reaction.

26:57.800 --> 27:00.760
We're sitting here on Thursday night, pre-taping Sunday show.

27:00.760 --> 27:02.720
And there's already been some early reactions.

27:02.720 --> 27:05.280
Some folks in the States have picked it up and have

27:05.280 --> 27:07.120
some interesting things to say about it.

27:07.120 --> 27:09.160
So we will take a quick break.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.360
About the overwhelming lack of monkeys.

27:11.360 --> 27:15.160
yes about the lack of monkey sex we're gonna play some another's for the hell

27:15.160 --> 27:16.000
of it

27:16.000 --> 27:20.120
uh... we're feeling uh... saucy so let's start this off with speak up another

27:20.120 --> 27:20.840
will be back

27:20.840 --> 27:27.840
on Orange Lawn Radio.

30:20.840 --> 30:22.840
Go, go, go, go, go!

30:50.840 --> 30:52.840
Oh

33:20.840 --> 33:24.660
But, and I was sitting here going, this song isn't any different.

33:24.660 --> 33:29.300
And then finally, they're like, wait, Jamie and Brad are like, wait, wait for it, wait

33:29.300 --> 33:30.300
for it.

33:30.300 --> 33:34.700
And then finally in the end, it has that little way different part of the end.

33:34.700 --> 33:40.540
So what a cool roll to see if I'm getting drunk.

33:40.540 --> 33:44.420
All right, you're getting drunk.

33:44.420 --> 33:58.420
We're talking about the potential battle royale game that's going to be going on.

33:58.420 --> 33:59.420
Yeah, what's this?

33:59.420 --> 34:03.980
You've taken this battle royale kind of, well, I hate to call it a joke, because it's not

34:03.980 --> 34:10.780
really a joke, but it's kind of like this, instead of an inside joke, it's like an inside

34:10.780 --> 34:16.000
cult. It's basically what it has come down to. You've got this little inside cult of

34:16.000 --> 34:21.180
folks here locally in Sacramento and abroad because it's kind of spawned from the Orange

34:21.180 --> 34:26.220
Lounge chat room and then some. Just this obsession with the movie Battle Royale. And

34:26.220 --> 34:27.220
now...

34:27.220 --> 34:38.080
I'm running a game probably in a few weeks. Me and Jess and now Puppy's involved.

34:38.080 --> 34:43.460
Puppy's testing his dice script in our chat room right now, but we're uh, yeah

34:43.460 --> 34:49.180
It's gonna be definitely a dice based. Go ahead and give a couple little spoilers about that

34:49.420 --> 34:52.140
We've already selected what the random weapons are

34:56.460 --> 35:00.540
There's gonna be people are gonna have certain skills like, you know people normally do

35:01.740 --> 35:05.520
You've got your stats, you know, we'll help you with that. We're

35:05.520 --> 35:14.520
I'm sort of half deciding of having the game last a few weeks more than just the normal, however many it takes to kill everybody off.

35:14.520 --> 35:21.520
So you can establish what your character's like and your friends and your group before you decide to kill each other off.

35:21.520 --> 35:25.520
So how exactly is it going to work? Is it going to be like a chat room that runs 24 hours a day?

35:25.520 --> 35:26.520
No.

35:26.520 --> 35:28.520
No, it's only going to be a certain day and time.

35:28.520 --> 35:34.520
It's going to be probably three hours until the game should last, or until we say, okay, we're tired.

35:34.520 --> 35:35.520
Got it.

35:35.520 --> 35:37.520
And it's going to be one night a week.

35:37.520 --> 35:41.520
I'll do my best to put it on a Friday night.

35:41.520 --> 35:45.520
I'm thinking a Friday night would be the best night for this.

35:45.520 --> 35:48.520
And basically, you roleplay.

35:48.520 --> 35:53.520
And if you suck at roleplay, by the way, as in you're not staying in character,

35:53.520 --> 35:57.520
You're not developing your character, even though your character is going to die.

35:57.520 --> 36:00.520
You'll just die all the faster.

36:00.520 --> 36:03.520
Because I'm a pretty spiteful GM.

36:03.520 --> 36:08.520
Which is probably why I will not be participating, because I suck at roleplay.

36:08.520 --> 36:13.520
I was always there to provoke the GM in interesting ways.

36:13.520 --> 36:18.520
Well, I sometimes think that it's a little bit easier to roleplay online.

36:18.520 --> 36:25.520
online as opposed to tabletop, just because you have a little bit more room for some description

36:25.520 --> 36:31.520
and you don't, if you're a shy person by nature you don't have to say something that you would

36:31.520 --> 36:34.520
normally be uncomfortable saying, it's easier to type it.

36:34.520 --> 36:43.520
Ah, you need to roleplay and say that in a British accent. Anyway, as promised, oh yeah,

36:43.520 --> 36:45.520
Oh yeah, Brad, do you have something you want to say?

36:46.520 --> 36:47.020
No.

36:47.020 --> 36:47.520
Okay.

36:47.520 --> 36:49.020
As we promised before the break...

36:49.020 --> 36:50.020
I killed you!

36:51.020 --> 36:55.520
We were going to talk about Max 2 just came out in Japan this week,

36:55.520 --> 36:58.520
and there's probably more information on it now that it's Sunday,

36:58.520 --> 37:01.020
but it's only Thursday when we're taping here,

37:01.020 --> 37:03.020
and we don't know a lot at this point.

37:03.020 --> 37:07.020
However, we do know what the unlocks are.

37:07.020 --> 37:10.520
So, the unlocks that you're going to get in Max 2,

37:10.520 --> 37:17.500
you've got me burping that's the first time like no the next unlock is all of

37:17.500 --> 37:21.380
the um remix actually I don't know what order these unlock in sorry I haven't

37:21.380 --> 37:25.740
gotten those kind of lists or anything but you get all the remixes the max 2

37:25.740 --> 37:30.940
remixes that you can play in extreme right and then we know that you can

37:30.940 --> 37:35.720
unlock crash or actually I think that's one of the songs you start off with is

37:35.720 --> 37:43.120
crash and then a paranoia survivor and there was one more love love shine or

37:43.120 --> 37:49.120
love love sugar one of those two love love shine it's love love shine you get

37:49.120 --> 37:56.960
you also unlock almost everything from us a mix that was from the max USA that

37:56.960 --> 38:04.320
was exclusive except the license tracks so you get shining Polaris peace out

38:04.320 --> 38:07.320
Overblast, Logical Dash, Jammin' Marmalade, and I'm For Real.

38:07.320 --> 38:08.320
You get all that.

38:08.320 --> 38:13.320
And you also get Look to the Sky, True Color, Dynamite Rave, Downbird Soda.

38:13.320 --> 38:14.320
You get all those songs.

38:14.320 --> 38:16.320
We had them first.

38:16.320 --> 38:17.320
Yeah, we had them first.

38:17.320 --> 38:18.320
So, Neenar.

38:18.320 --> 38:21.320
And we still have I Like to Move It.

38:21.320 --> 38:23.320
Black Hawk.

38:23.320 --> 38:27.320
Also, for whatever reason, they're bringing back Kind Lady and So in Love.

38:27.320 --> 38:33.320
I mean, those songs are pretty cool and all, but it's kind of interesting because they were on the last mix.

38:33.320 --> 38:37.320
Also, there's some brand spankin' new stuff.

38:38.320 --> 38:46.320
Do It Right, the 80s electro mix, which is remixed by Soda, and I hear it's pretty good.

38:46.320 --> 38:49.320
We had some folks in the chat room that have heard it, and it's pretty good.

38:49.320 --> 38:53.320
As soon as we get MP3s, we'll play them for you guys.

38:53.320 --> 38:57.320
Kind Lady, the interlude, whatever that could mean.

38:57.320 --> 39:00.320
I wonder if that's just that little groove beat at the beginning.

39:00.320 --> 39:10.640
You said it like a banjo. Rob does bluegrass.

39:10.640 --> 39:17.080
You know what? Yeah, I want to get an MP3 so I don't have to sing this. I'm trying to

39:17.080 --> 39:20.880
find an MP3 so you can hear what I'm talking about here. Okay, like this part.

39:20.880 --> 39:26.920
Like the porno part.

39:26.920 --> 39:29.920
We used that in a porn movie and we did one, so I remember that.

39:29.920 --> 39:30.920
Or me, Rob.

39:30.920 --> 39:31.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:31.920 --> 39:32.920
Right, sure, yeah.

39:32.920 --> 39:34.920
As I leave the room.

39:34.920 --> 39:39.920
Also unlockable, Look to the Sky, the trance mix.

39:39.920 --> 39:42.920
Which is not Look to the Sky, the true color mix.

39:42.920 --> 39:45.920
Now there's going to be three Look to the Skies all together.

39:45.920 --> 39:47.920
Look to the Sky fart mix.

39:48.920 --> 39:51.920
Look to the Sky because it stinks down below.

39:51.920 --> 40:16.680
p0k3smot42o

40:16.680 --> 40:19.220
It's like the lesson Oni.

40:19.220 --> 40:21.040
Be For You, of course.

40:21.040 --> 40:24.300
Because where would we be without a Be For You Oni course?

40:24.300 --> 40:30.340
Nearly 130, however, since a minute it did not make it into Max 2 home version, they

40:30.340 --> 40:33.120
have Spin the Disc replacing a minute.

40:33.120 --> 40:34.400
Spin the Dix!

40:34.400 --> 40:38.580
They have the From 2D X Course, except now it has like Gem of Marmalade and all these

40:38.580 --> 40:40.700
other songs.

40:40.700 --> 40:46.360
The Love Song collection, which is Baby Love Me, So in Love, Silent Hill, Dive,

40:46.360 --> 40:51.160
Dive Into The Night, which I never knew was a love song, and My Summer Love.

40:51.160 --> 40:55.200
Now they have a DJ Soda Oni, which is pretty cool.

40:55.200 --> 40:59.480
A middle tempo chorus, which is like just kind of all like...

40:59.480 --> 41:05.760
I'm just noticing something. It says DJ Soda Oni. Why is Kind Lady in there? I thought it was Okuyoto's.

41:05.760 --> 41:11.480
But Kind Lady Interlude, I believe, is remixed by Soda.

41:11.480 --> 41:12.320
Alright.

41:12.320 --> 41:16.240
And then you have the middle tempo chorus, which is kind of like a bunch of dance mania songs.

41:16.240 --> 41:20.480
you have a course called rap mania

41:20.480 --> 41:21.960
and these are the songs

41:21.960 --> 41:25.640
these are the songs that apparently are rap according to konami

41:25.640 --> 41:28.280
long long train running

41:28.280 --> 41:30.560
little boy

41:30.560 --> 41:32.360
superstar

41:32.360 --> 41:33.720
hysteria

41:33.720 --> 41:35.340
detour

41:35.340 --> 41:40.440
burn in the floor and be free

41:40.440 --> 41:43.200
uh... there at the midnight blue courses back

41:43.200 --> 41:49.200
Except they've replaced one song with another AM3P remix. I don't know what song they took out, but...

41:50.200 --> 41:53.200
Do you remember the original Midnight Blue chorus?

41:54.200 --> 41:55.200
No, I remember the original.

41:55.200 --> 41:57.200
Alright, whatever, fine.

41:58.200 --> 42:04.200
Now they have a BPM 140 chorus, so now we have nearly 130 and nearly 140.

42:05.200 --> 42:06.200
Hooray.

42:07.200 --> 42:11.200
A tricky chorus, which I'm not sure yet, but rumored...

42:11.200 --> 42:13.200
What's wrong with all the changes?

42:41.200 --> 42:45.640
like burning heat two-speed burst boost reverse and then kind lady three-speed

42:45.640 --> 42:52.760
boost so it like it just fucks up all your modifiers there's a Naoki platinum

42:52.760 --> 42:57.460
course which actually I believe is the same course I think that's the one

42:57.460 --> 43:03.240
course that retained itself Wow I'll be damn some course in Japanese

43:03.240 --> 43:08.160
well I don't know I can't translate it has a star in it so it's not really all

43:08.160 --> 43:15.480
Japanese something woman is it like the diva course it could be I think these

43:15.480 --> 43:20.160
are all yeah these are all songs by women yeah what's up oh and put it into

43:20.160 --> 43:27.920
global gate yeah well let's see let's translate that

43:27.920 --> 43:53.400
The answer is Maiden Way.

43:53.400 --> 43:56.080
Up and down is another course.

43:56.080 --> 43:59.720
I have no idea what these songs have in common.

43:59.720 --> 44:08.320
And then there's the shitty Demon Road, which has D2R, Waka Laka, Transition Arrow, Stay,

44:08.320 --> 44:09.720
Subaru, and Max Unlimited.

44:09.720 --> 44:11.220
That's it.

44:11.220 --> 44:15.400
And then there's the last chorus is Ultra 12, which has a bunch of interesting stuff

44:15.400 --> 44:16.400
on it.

44:16.400 --> 44:20.480
What about the Ultra 64?

44:20.480 --> 44:21.480
No.

44:21.480 --> 44:22.960
No Ultra 64.

44:22.960 --> 44:26.760
How about your mom?

44:26.760 --> 44:30.400
She's swell.

44:30.400 --> 44:31.400
Not my mom.

44:31.400 --> 44:32.400
Somebody else's mom.

44:32.400 --> 44:33.400
Not to my mommy.

44:33.400 --> 44:36.360
Someone's sick and very inch-long.

44:36.360 --> 44:41.080
So you can order that now, DDR Max 2, and also if you ordered it from Konami style already,

44:41.080 --> 44:45.280
you'll be getting a V-Rare CD, and what's interesting is that those tracks on the V-Rare

44:45.280 --> 44:49.920
CD that we talked about, like Glacial, the I Feel remix, the soda remix of I Feel and

44:49.920 --> 44:56.920
I'm going to have to be in a future one.

44:56.920 --> 45:03.920
one

45:05.960 --> 45:08.760
all you have already heard yet there's some other features in there like you

45:08.760 --> 45:11.120
can create your own only course

45:11.120 --> 45:12.540
who

45:12.540 --> 45:19.540
and uh...

45:21.360 --> 45:26.760
anything else you guys want to say about max too

45:26.760 --> 45:28.760
So I have to get it next month.

45:56.760 --> 45:58.760
What? I'm what?

45:58.760 --> 46:00.760
You're doing that instead of being in such a good chat room.

46:00.760 --> 46:02.760
Fuck the chat room.

46:02.760 --> 46:04.760
No, just kidding.

46:04.760 --> 46:06.760
I love the chat room.

46:06.760 --> 46:08.760
For dinner.

46:08.760 --> 46:10.760
He loves the chat room.

46:10.760 --> 46:12.760
Op, I have boots.

46:12.760 --> 46:14.760
Chuck, chuck.

46:14.760 --> 46:16.760
Get you the hot bullets of shotgun to die.

46:16.760 --> 46:18.760
Tell us about that story, Brad.

46:18.760 --> 46:20.760
No.

46:20.760 --> 46:22.760
Please, please.

46:22.760 --> 46:29.760
I've been hearing from DarkSakuraSO that he's been saying the thing, he goes,

46:29.760 --> 46:31.760
Get you the hot shotgun bullets to die.

46:31.760 --> 46:38.760
And it's kind of like in the vein of all your base, you know, bad English, some bad translation from an old Japanese game.

46:38.760 --> 46:44.760
I found out on Engrish.com, which I love, go check it out, Engrish.com, great.

46:44.760 --> 46:49.760
That it's from a game called Battle Rangers, so if you want to go pick up a ROM for it somewhere in your arcade,

46:49.760 --> 46:58.760
and it's got some great Engrish jewels in there. Anyway, so yeah, check it out, it's

46:58.760 --> 46:59.760
funny.

46:59.760 --> 47:04.160
Ah! Sorry, I was looking up something in the background.

47:04.160 --> 47:09.040
We're going to do a segment on this show.

47:09.040 --> 47:13.040
Hey, Cap, you're on Engrish!

47:13.040 --> 47:21.040
Yeah, we're going to translate Konami's Q&A on Max 2, and we're going to read it.

47:21.040 --> 47:23.920
So it's like a radio drama, so this will be fun.

47:23.920 --> 47:29.040
So this segment is called Engrish Like What?

47:29.040 --> 47:31.040
Engrish Like What?

47:31.040 --> 47:33.040
Engrish Like What?

47:33.040 --> 47:35.040
Engrish Like What?

47:35.040 --> 47:37.040
Engrish Like What?

47:37.040 --> 47:42.040
Alright, who wants to be Question Man and who wants to be Answer Man?

47:42.040 --> 47:47.040
Alright, Brad, are you Question Man or Answer Man?

47:47.040 --> 47:49.040
I'll be Question Man.

47:49.040 --> 47:51.040
Alright, Question Man, first question.

47:51.040 --> 47:53.040
You just sound like you're Mega Man.

47:53.040 --> 47:55.040
Question Man, I will ask you a question.

47:55.040 --> 47:59.040
Okay, so we have it in English. Is this it?

47:59.040 --> 48:04.040
Okay, can an exclusive controller be used even if set to PS2?

48:04.040 --> 48:09.620

48:09.620 --> 48:20.860
operates satisfactory yay best radio ever please this is a question please

48:20.860 --> 48:24.800
leave with an arcade machine or teach me the method using editing data in the

48:24.800 --> 48:30.740
PlayStation quote-unquote software dance dance revolution series when linked

48:30.740 --> 48:35.940
within Arcade Machine, output Edit Data by Library Management. Copy the Edit Data file

48:35.940 --> 48:41.160
which outputted to memory card for Playstation by browser of Playstation 2. The Edit Data

48:41.160 --> 48:46.400
file copied to memory card for PlayStation can be used now by Arcade Machine etc. When

48:46.400 --> 48:51.740
the Edit Data of the past series is used, copy an Edit Data file to the memory card

48:51.740 --> 48:57.060
only for Playstation 2 from memory card for Playstation by the browser of Playstation 2".

48:57.060 --> 49:04.060
Load the memory card, only for PlayStation 2 which copy data, and start edit mode input data by outside manager.

49:04.060 --> 49:09.060
The data inputted by the edit library can be edited in edit mode or can be used in game mode.

49:09.060 --> 49:14.060
Game mode? Oh, oh, very nice, very good.

49:14.060 --> 49:20.060
Okay, is it the function in which a screen position can be adjusted care in Dance Dance Revolution?

49:20.060 --> 49:26.060
The screen adjustment function of demand is added to option from the second edition DDR Max 2 of PS.

49:26.060 --> 49:31.060
Please confirm by options. Graphic options screen adjustment.

49:31.060 --> 49:34.060
Oh my god. You know what? Okay.

49:34.060 --> 49:37.060
And that was Max 2 Engrish.

49:37.060 --> 49:42.060
Max 2 Engrish. Max 2 Engrish. Max 2 Engrish.

49:42.060 --> 49:43.060
I think it was Engrish like what originally.

49:43.060 --> 49:45.060
Whatever. Oh yeah sorry.

49:45.060 --> 49:49.060
Engrish like what? Engrish like what?

49:49.060 --> 49:54.860
Okay, you know what's funnier because I've done this before is going to the Konami site, the 2dex site where they have

49:55.780 --> 50:01.780
They have like interviews with some of the artists for the new songs on each version when it comes out. Translate that shit

50:01.780 --> 50:03.780
It's really fucking awful

50:04.060 --> 50:09.060
Okay, well now you don't have to now. I'm just saying you know if you want to do this kind of thing someday, okay?

50:09.060 --> 50:11.540
Yeah, because I'm sure you bored listeners too

50:11.540 --> 50:16.820
and and by the way the site used for the translations is nifty.com slash

50:16.820 --> 50:25.200
globally victory hey I have samurai showdown on neogeo and it does say

50:25.200 --> 50:29.880
victory you know what's funny if you have the jet any of the Japanese games

50:29.880 --> 50:33.920
like I have the Japanese samurai spirits too which is summer show now it'll play

50:33.920 --> 50:38.660
it in American mode and turn all the blood into sweat so like these big

50:38.660 --> 50:41.840
Geezers of white fluid comes shooting out of their bodies

50:45.140 --> 50:50.340
Unbelievably powerful you are now finally the strongest pro team accepts your challenge

50:53.820 --> 50:57.580
Yeah, I'm looking at English calm right now, it's it's definitely exciting

50:58.500 --> 51:03.100
Let's see my spirit burns like the Sun and I shall dry you like a prune

51:03.100 --> 51:31.220
Here's the ending to Ghosts and Goblins.

51:31.220 --> 51:38.220
the wise and courageous door, a night that you are, you feel strong swelling in your

51:38.860 --> 51:45.860
body. Return to starting point, challenge again.

51:45.860 --> 51:50.860
I feel this strong swelling inside my body.

51:50.860 --> 51:57.860
I think you need to see a doctor for that condition

52:20.860 --> 52:26.500
for two centuries. Since the stardate had established, they sailed all around the

52:26.500 --> 52:31.860
galaxy with new type spaceship called Lightship Lightship. But one day the

52:31.860 --> 52:36.900
piece was disturbed by a mysterious big fortress. It was living and was destroying

52:36.900 --> 52:42.020
all other civilizations. The Federal Bureau of Galactic Government organized

52:42.020 --> 52:46.620
the defense force immediately, but as the air fortress had very high

52:46.620 --> 52:52.620
potential the defense force was wiped out in vain so the federal bureau has

52:52.620 --> 52:59.180
decided to select a specially trained man ID 2592 named Hal Bailman and has

52:59.180 --> 53:04.440
developed a new type light brancer and armored suit now he departs for the air

53:04.440 --> 53:11.200
fortress with a destiny of farmell farmell it sounds like propelled the

53:41.200 --> 53:46.500
on this highly recommended by the staff of orange launch radio

53:46.500 --> 53:52.340
yes i have to read this one

53:52.340 --> 53:55.260
i'm cock

53:55.260 --> 53:56.740
what kind of world of this

53:56.740 --> 54:03.740
it's kind of crap

54:06.640 --> 54:07.680
his name is

54:07.680 --> 54:16.680
Raman Saurus. He is urchin, has many curiosity, but he is a person who makes much good looks.

54:16.680 --> 54:20.680
Yeah, Raman Sauruses have an image to uphold.

54:26.680 --> 54:29.680
What? What are you looking for?

54:29.680 --> 54:33.680
I think that I like the one that has World of Pain on it.

54:33.680 --> 54:35.680
And then no smorking.

54:35.680 --> 54:37.680
Thank you, man!

54:38.680 --> 54:40.680
This is really, really brilliant radio.

54:40.680 --> 54:42.680
Okay.

54:42.680 --> 54:48.680
Okay, this is something that was posted on an evacuation map in a hotel in China.

54:48.680 --> 54:50.680
Please keep calm when there is a fire.

54:50.680 --> 54:55.680
The hotel will ensure your safety and shit with advanced fire facilities.

54:55.680 --> 55:00.680
Please go to the exit according to the instructions so that our staff will lead you to safe zone.

55:00.680 --> 55:22.680
Oh, the everyday I hate my life.

55:22.680 --> 55:27.920
I hate my life. Every day I polish my revolver and I shoot my head like a rock star. I'm

55:27.920 --> 55:28.920
cock, what?

55:28.920 --> 55:30.920
I'm trying to read this chick's shirt. It says, I'm cock.

55:30.920 --> 55:34.360
I'm home, I'm all alone, I need some, her coffee.

55:34.360 --> 55:35.360
Hot coffee.

55:35.360 --> 55:43.280
No, oh. There were three Jovial Welshmen as I have something.

55:43.280 --> 55:50.000
And they would go hunting upon Saint Davids, said it was a ship, that either he said the

55:50.000 --> 55:56.000
chimney blown away whatever. I want the one that says spread beaver showing the

55:56.000 --> 56:07.000
vaginal area. It says showing the vaginal area. That's it.

56:07.000 --> 56:20.420
I want that shirt. I would wear that shirt.

56:20.420 --> 56:25.300
Spread Beaver was actually the name of a band in Japan fronted by the ex-Japan guitarist

56:25.300 --> 56:26.300
Hide.

56:26.300 --> 56:29.300
Yeah, but he's dead now. Is he?

56:29.300 --> 56:30.300
Yeah.

56:30.300 --> 56:32.300
He's living in front of the door.

56:32.300 --> 56:46.300
Everybody said he hung himself, but what I heard is that he, uh, what he actually did was, um, when he practices guitar sometimes he would tie like a belt or something around his neck and then tie it to the back of a, um, like a door.

56:46.300 --> 56:50.300
This sounds kind of crazy, but because he could lean his head forward, it would just rest his head or something.

56:50.300 --> 56:54.300
And the only reason why I believe this is because I have friends that have done this before.

56:54.300 --> 57:00.300
It's some weird kind of relaxation thing, and I guess, like, it choked him to death or something, but I don't know.

57:00.300 --> 57:02.300
Hey, fack you, man!

57:02.300 --> 57:07.300
It's still stupid. I have my HIDE plushie hanging from a doorknob.

57:07.300 --> 57:10.300
That's awful.

57:10.300 --> 57:12.300
I bought a HIDE plushie.

57:12.300 --> 57:15.300
He has this string on his head so you can hang him up.

57:15.300 --> 57:17.300
So I was hanging a doorknob out by him.

57:17.300 --> 57:24.300
Yeah, because apparently it was tied to the doorknob and that's when they found him or something, so...

57:24.300 --> 57:27.300
That's really disgusting, but it's so funny.

57:27.300 --> 57:31.300
I'm just, you know, being true to the original.

57:31.300 --> 57:33.300
Oh, man.

57:33.300 --> 57:39.300
Yeah, my JF game plushie has two bullet holes in its head and shoulder.

57:39.300 --> 57:42.300
C'mon, anybody else want to play with the internet?

58:09.300 --> 58:19.300
We wanted this to be a treat. For those of you who listen to Orange Alums radio a lot, we wanted this sneak preview of what is sure to be a very...

58:22.800 --> 58:26.300
Turn off all pagers and cell phones. Thank you. Hope you have a nice play again.

58:27.300 --> 58:32.300
We wanted this to be a special treat for those of you who listen to Orange Alums a lot to get to hear this show like before everyone else.

58:32.300 --> 58:34.300
And aren't you happy?

58:34.300 --> 58:38.300
Um, yeah, so we don't have a lot of people available to vote, but we can do one anyway.

58:39.300 --> 58:40.300
Yes?

58:40.300 --> 58:44.300
I think that we should do, um, um...

58:52.300 --> 58:54.300
What is this, Guess My Cell Phone?

58:54.300 --> 59:18.900
p0k3smot42o

59:48.900 --> 59:50.900
It was either that or this one.

01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:22.200

Put it to hell, I'll blow it!

01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:05.940
The last time I die, that's real!

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:07.940
Push the mic, I'll rip it!

01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:09.940

The last time I die, and I'm back!

01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:17.940
Where are you from? Where are you at? Where are you going?

01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:19.940
Just follow the beat, come on!

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:57.940
Jump out of the beach, jump out of the beach, come on, everybody let's go, jump out of the beach

01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:51.940
Oh

01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:21.940
Ha-cha!

01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:40.940
Oh, come the egg on the mountain top

01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:44.940
The punkiest monkey that ever hiked

01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:48.940
He knew every last trick under the sun

01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:52.940
She's a god, so everybody can have some fun

01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:57.940
Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic

01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:01.940
Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic

01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:08.940
There's a little bit of Monkey Magic

01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:12.940
To tell you where to find me

01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:16.940
There's a little bit of Monkey Magic

01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:32.940
Oh, from an egg on the mountain top, the punkiest monkey that ever talked.

01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:37.940
He knew every magic under the sun.

01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:41.940
He'd chase the gods and everyone had some fun.

01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:58.940
Keep on keepin' magic, keep on keepin' magic

01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:34.940
Bitch, get a new song! An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:38.940
Funny enough, she never did find a new song. We haven't heard from Joga in a long, long time.

01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:43.940
Good. The only Joga I'm interested in is York.

01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:48.940
State of emergency!

01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:51.940
Yeah. Anywho.

01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:54.940
Sorry, Rob, you're not small, cute, and Icelandic.

01:08:54.940 --> 01:09:03.940
You know what's interesting? I don't, I don't, okay, we've talked about her on the show before, this Japanese rocker girl chick who's awesome, her name's Kana.

01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:05.940
And like, I got my, my-

01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:08.940
You can play Nikku if you have it. Oh my god, you have to play Nikku.

01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:11.940
I think I might, I think you've sent it to me. But anyway, I have a point to this.

01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:19.940
Our new friend Garrett, who we discovered like randomly on a 2DX machine four weeks ago, and we just kind of picked him up and made him come home with us and play with us.

01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:26.100
play with us. Not like that, you perverts. I was showing him Kana videos the other night

01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:29.700
and he was just laughing his ass off going, this is great, she's kind of like the Japanese

01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:39.700
Bjork. And I had a point to this story but I don't remember what it was.

01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:45.700
I think so, she does at least speak secular, but Kana is cool.

01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:47.700
Kana is the shit.

01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:49.700
I think I sent you through those.

01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:51.700
I have a question, was she from a band originally?

01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:52.700
I don't think so.

01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:54.700
Oh okay, I can swear she was from some other band.

01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:56.700
Her whole gimmick is that she does the elegant...

01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:57.700
Gothic Lolita stuff?

01:09:57.700 --> 01:09:58.700
Yeah.

01:09:58.700 --> 01:09:59.700
Yeah.

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:02.700
She's, you know, I like when she's got a little panda thing and...

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:03.700
And she does panda bondage.

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:07.700
Yeah, she has a lot of panda bondage, which is really weird because they don't rape pandas, do you?

01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:09.700
The poor pandas, they're like, you know...

01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:11.700
They didn't rape the pandas, they just wrapped some ribbons.

01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:12.700
Oh, okay.

01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:13.700
Bondaged it.

01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:15.700
I was gonna say the, uh, the WWF...

01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:16.700
RIBBON!

01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:17.700
...over you guys.

01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:18.700
Rip what?

01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:19.700
RIBBON!

01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:20.700
RIBBON?

01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:21.700
SORTED!

01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:22.700
ARROWED!

01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:23.700
What?

01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:24.700
ORDINATE!

01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:25.700
What?

01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:26.700
Oh my.

01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:28.700
Jamie's lost her...

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:30.700
Jamie has lost her mind.

01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:31.700
Whatever.

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:32.700
Yes.

01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:36.700
But for some reason I thought she was from like Malismizer, but that's a gag, I think.

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:40.700
Malice Meijer's never had a Nikita reverse cape unless she count Mana.

01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:44.700
Oh yeah, oh that's right, it's the guy who looks like a girl.

01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:48.700
And they both show up in the Gothic and Lolita Vibles.

01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:52.700
Yeah, I saw in that one that Rob got you.

01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:56.700
Shall we get to the FUs of the week now?

01:10:56.700 --> 01:11:22.060
It hurts a lot, it's been hurting me for like two weeks now and I'm thinking if I get in

01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:29.060
And I have this other crap now that I'm going to take, and I have this heat pad attached

01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:36.700
to my butt. It's sort of like in my pants. This is one that you wrap around your stomach,

01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:42.700
except I couldn't get it to sit low enough, so I just tore the velcro part off and stuck

01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:49.700
it in my pants. So now it's warm, my back is warm, my lower back is warm, but still

01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:57.700
But still it hurts like fuck. It hurts like bondage fuck.

01:11:57.700 --> 01:11:59.700
It hurts!

01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:01.700
I don't know.

01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:07.700
My other fuck you again goes to Squeamix for sucking.

01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:13.700
And another one goes toward having no money so I can't have my games right now.

01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:20.700
And a Happy Fuck You goes to the ending of Final Fantasy X-2, which I'm not going to spoil for anybody.

01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:23.700
But I like it, but there needs to be more.

01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:32.700
And also, a Fuck You, again, goes toward Final Fantasy X-2 for having a freaking confusing-ass storyline.

01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:36.700
So I guess I'm not going to get it until I actually play through the game.

01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:41.700
And, um, another one goes toward not really having any wine.

01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:44.700
Cause, you know, yeah.

01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:46.700
Cause I've had salad today and that's it.

01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:49.700
Oh yeah, another front key goes toward not being able to digest anything.

01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:50.700
Okay.

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:53.700
That was beautiful, thank you.

01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:58.700
Um, I have some FUs this week.

01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:03.700
My biggest FU this week goes to procrastination.

01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:09.900
You guys have seen the house right and what's happening on Saturday? I'm moving you're moving

01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:12.060
How many boxes have you seen that have been packed?

01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:14.940
None, there's one in the living room

01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:24.100
So I was given an interesting strategy on how to pack my shit because well, that's not dirty

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:27.100
I was giving you a strategy on how to pack stuff up

01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:43.620
If California were going to fall off into the ocean and everyone had to evacuate to

01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:52.060
an island, who do you think would be out first, the lesbians or the gay men?

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:54.660
The game would still be packing their shit. Well, let's get dropped like he split

01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:03.300
My next step you of the week goes to bad jokes

01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:08.520
You heard it in the taxi cab in Vegas

01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:12.540
Bring it drunk god bless Vegas. I

01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:15.460
Think I might have been yes

01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:22.020
I was because it was with me and iguana girl and island are coming back from circus circus being drunk

01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:23.380
off of

01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:25.380
work for preaches

01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:28.040
planes

01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:31.300
well anyway i procrastinated and i have packed dampening and i'm moving on

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:32.340
saturday

01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:35.420
actually know if you go out my garage i have a lot of shit boxes early do you

01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:38.220
know why because they never unpacked last night

01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:41.100
my house

01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:44.940
so moving is going to be so bad as i've packed this up my

01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:47.560
close all my clothes without

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:48.960
any hope

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:52.640
I had an interesting strategy sent to me on how to pack my stuff, and this was sent to

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:54.400
me by Garrett, somebody I was talking about earlier.

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:59.640
Get some big boxes and do something like label my boxes upper-right part of closet, lower-left

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:03.680
part of closet, shit on the floor in living room, and then fill them up accordingly.

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:04.680
That's how I pack.

01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:05.680
I have another thing here.

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:13.600
I think I get hit by a spider.

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:16.240
On your cleavage.

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:17.240
Or if you're French.

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:22.240
Okay, I'm gonna go watch, because I think I have to buy a sweater, so fuck that fighter!

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:40.240
How do you always give me this?

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:42.240
That's just cute.

01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:44.240
That's fuck you music. Okay.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:51.240
Um, I had a fuck you, but my mind just went blank because I just got a phone call.

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:55.240
Anyway, um, what were we just talking about?

01:15:55.240 --> 01:16:00.240
Okay, oh yes, we were talking about Jamie's breasteses.

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:10.240
Okay, no, fuck you goes to people, no offense Jamie, but fuck you goes to people who spoil games for themselves and waiting...

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:15.240
No, for themselves. I mean, like, instead of waiting till the game comes out, they, like, read about the stories.

01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:18.240
Yeah, Jamie's like, I'm getting the game anyway.

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:20.240
I'm poor, I can't have the game.

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:23.240
I know how this is connected to a station.

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:28.240
Um, and I had something else, but I don't remember, so. I want to eat. I want to go.

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:29.240
Okay.

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:31.240
I say we fuck the show.

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:33.240
Okay.

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:37.240
If we can make it through another half hour, I know we can, and we can get to two hours.

01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:43.240
Actually, we do have a present for the last hour of the show, so we'll get to that later.

01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:44.240
A gift.

01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:45.240
We're making a gift.

01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:46.240
We've made a gift.

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:47.240
We're making a gift.

01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:48.240
Actually, Jamie made a gift.

01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:52.240
Hey, if you look on my friend's page in my live journal, actually in one of the communities

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:55.240
I'm on, someone posted a really cool picture of Margaret Cho.

01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:56.240
Really?

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:57.240
Yeah.

01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:58.240
She's so cool.

01:16:58.240 --> 01:16:59.240
It's in the Phycax community.

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:01.240
Let's get to Chatroom FUs, shall we?

01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:05.240
FagHags community.

01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:22.240
I'm looking because Puppey sent me an interesting FU. It involves a web link.

01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:25.240
And he might have already deleted it.

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:29.680
He wants to give a big F.U. to somebody that posted something naughty in his girlfriend's

01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:30.680
journal.

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:31.680
I'm loading that up.

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:32.680
We'll come back to his F.U.

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:33.680
Let's go to Zero's F.U.s.

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:36.800
Uh, F.U. to not being able to be there tonight.

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:37.800
Yeah, where's Zero?

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:38.800
We miss you.

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:42.560
F.U. to my legs giving out in the middle of Legend of Max all three times.

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:46.040
F.U. to my ass hurting as I fall to the ground on Legend of Max.

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:50.680
F.U. to stupid assholes who think because they live in my house I can fuck shit up.

01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:54.280
Dark Sakura, I think we can use those boxes.

01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:58.280
Stop trying to get people to buy your fucking alcohol, I think I will turn your stupid ass in.

01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:02.280
Darkchild says, fuck you to the stupid 17 year old girl who keeps calling me.

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:06.280
Although it would have been smarter to have given her the wrong phone number.

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:11.280
Hey, you know what? I want to talk to her. Let me talk to her.

01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:14.280
Better yet, let's talk to her live on air.

01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:16.280
Get her number, I'll call her.

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:20.280
We'll find a way to tape the conversation.

01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:27.280
Dark Tetsuya would like to say fuck not knowing what to do with crushes indeed and for Angel fuck having to work and missing the surprise.

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:35.280
I know what you mean a little bit, actually. I actually know what you mean very well.

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:43.280
Jon Fields would like to say F you two idiot that would try to make Metroid movie.

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:50.800
Nearly every movie based on game has failed even worse F you to Nintendo for allowing the movie the wizard from being made

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:53.900
Hey, the wizard rules hold on

01:18:55.420 --> 01:19:00.540
The wizard all those games are movies a double dragon you all sucked ass

01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:06.340
Actually, I haven't seen the business. I guess I shouldn't judge it, but Resident Evil was probably the best

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:10.840
video game to movie production ever and if if

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:31.840
If they're going to start doing, because movie producers and directors are starting to notice this kind of stuff is becoming popular, like the comic book movies, the big budget comic book movies that are coming out, I think they're going to do pretty good with the Metroid movie. I'm hoping because, oh man, it would suck if Drew Barrymore was Samus or something. Oh my God.

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:02.840
Here you go.

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:12.840
Stop.

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:14.840
Stop.

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:22.720
The 23rd Magus will like to say F U to my screwy school schedule next week. Everyone

01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:26.940
else has to take their stupid little test, which leaves me in government class for five

01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:34.140
hours with no bathroom passes. What the fuck? F U to Angel's screwy work schedule. F U to

01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:38.620
having random DDRs at school begging me to take them to an Orange Lawns broadcast, which

01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:47.140
I will do, so fear. Sure you will. Out. Brak2000 would like to say, F you to sore throats.

01:20:47.140 --> 01:21:00.100
Everything tastes like, um, sore throat. Chloraseptic is your friend. Okay, I'm going back to Puppy's

01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:03.100
with the damn pages it's loading because LiveJournal is being a biznatch.

01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:06.100
God damn it.

01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:15.100
There we go.

01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:21.100
Ah! God, it's the stupid tub girl thing. God damn it, why'd you have to show that?

01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:26.100
I didn't even let the whole thing load. Like, 20 pixels of it came up,

01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:36.820
up I recognize as being disgusting and I put it off stupid kids easy it's

01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:43.460
Photoshop goat say was funny let me think of the Walmart that's on the

01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:49.940
corner of our mission now Walmart Walgreens by the mall let me think of

01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:54.940
I think it was about five minutes never.

01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:04.940
Shame on you, puppy. Bad puppy.

01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:07.940
That's me beating puppy with a newspaper.

01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:10.940
Bad puppy.

01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:13.940
It was just that fucking tub girl.

01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:17.940
Gross.

01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:18.940
I'm not hungry anymore.

01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:22.020
thank you man

01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:26.860
back you to black lab

01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:29.100
just

01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:32.260
for dinner

01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:35.420
right

01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:39.500
i think that they can get some ongoing barbecue

01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:42.880
you're mean

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:45.920
but he says it was more than that

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:47.840
uh... thank you

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:53.680
Don't. Oh, it's a twenty picture montage.

01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:57.300
Alright, look away. Here's your chance.

01:22:57.300 --> 01:23:02.940
Of course, that means, like, everybody's watching now.

01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:05.000
Who the hell did it?

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.300
Oh, it's gone.

01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:07.640
Puppy deleted it.

01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:09.900
Who the fuck did that anyway?

01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:12.400
No, let me know who did it.

01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:15.520
Save their IP. It was anonymous.

01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:16.960
You can IP track them?

01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:18.640
Yeah, you should log IPs.

01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:22.640
Puppy, if you want to plot some revenge, get with Jamie.

01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:24.260
I've done it. I have done it.

01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:27.400
And there are ways you can trace somebody down to their zip code.

01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:30.480
Find out where they live by their IP address.

01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:34.160
Jamie's a geek.

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:35.840
In a good way.

01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:42.840
That's how I knew who it was that it wasn't, um, you know, who spammed my live journal that it was his friend that did it.

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:13.840
coming into the chatroom.

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:14.840
We're live right now.

01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:15.840
Well, we're live on Thursday.

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:16.840
Yeah, right now we're live.

01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:17.840
If it's Thursday, we're live.

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:18.840
If it's Sunday, we're not.

01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:19.840
Actually, no.

01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:20.840
Because we rebroadcast.

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:21.840
The Thursday rebroadcast, usually.

01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:22.840
Anyway, fuck it.

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:23.840
Whatever.

01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:24.840
Fuck it.

01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:25.840
Either we're live or we're not.

01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:28.480
Just go to the chatroom and they'll tell you.

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:33.160
Go to calibumani.com, click on Orange Lounge, click on Chat.

01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:34.160
While Rob chokes on something.

01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:36.040
While I choke on something.

01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:40.560
And in the meantime, let's play, let's play Usao-kun.

01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:41.560
Let's play it the whole way through.

01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:46.560
And we'll play some other stuff from Keyboard Mania, because Keyboard Mania is happy, fun, joy of dance.

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:15.440
I love her

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:18.600
I love what she gives you

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:20.980
Nice?

01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:27.400
Bright Girl

01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:30.840
Keep quiet

01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:34.340
loved nerd

01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:35.940
Girls, run

01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:37.940
Kya!

01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:46.940
Shondori Ustaku

01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:53.940
Bikori Ustaku

01:25:57.940 --> 01:26:00.940
Ushikalandodela

01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:03.940
Inaneta Yoshi

01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:05.940
I'm gonna be your mama

01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:07.940
I'm gonna be your mama

01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:09.940
I'm gonna be your mama

01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:11.940
Bye, bye, bye, bye.

01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:13.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah

01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:19.940
Think about it

01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:21.940
We're long enough

01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:25.940
Reach out, buddy, feel the beat

01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:29.940
Come on, wake up

01:28:29.940 --> 01:28:32.940
Better get in charge of me

01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:36.940
I need the back of your mother's smile

01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:40.940
But it burns so bright

01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:42.940
Since we've done it all from out

01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:46.940
You'll be the star tonight

01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:47.940
Get with it

01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:49.940
But at last

01:28:49.940 --> 01:28:51.940
You've gotta tell me

01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:52.940
You know it's too late

01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:54.940
When you're dead and I'm dead

01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:56.940
Let it slip all right

01:28:56.940 --> 01:28:57.940
And set you strong

01:28:57.940 --> 01:28:59.940
But you don't make it sound

01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:04.940
It's time to give you love

01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:14.940
Hey, hey, hey

01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:17.940
I just believe

01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:21.940
You gotta feel it, yeah, yeah

01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:28.940
Hello? Hello, is this thing on testing? Testing one, two?

01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:40.340
I'm looking in the index but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

01:29:40.340 --> 01:29:44.340
Hello? I don't understand this. Does this thing work?

01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:46.340
This thing reads like stereo instructions. Is this on?

01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:49.340
What the hell?

01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:53.340
Orange Lounge Radio, broke down Get Opa Monte Radio.

01:29:53.340 --> 01:29:55.340
What the f***?

01:29:55.340 --> 01:29:58.340
And no better example of that than tonight, episode number 42.

01:29:58.340 --> 01:30:03.340
Do you get points if you can tell us where the beat came from?

01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:07.340
They know, that's so easy. I know one person that's going to get that in two seconds.

01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:10.340
Yeah, it's a nerd.

01:30:10.340 --> 01:30:14.340
Yeah, tell us the answer and then we can tease you because you're a dork.

01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:17.340
Yeah, that's what you win.

01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:18.940
YOU'RE SO STUPID!

01:30:18.940 --> 01:30:20.140
I didn't hear it, so...

01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:22.540
But I'm gonna guess it's the, uh, healing vision of Jellicans.

01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:23.340
WRONG!

01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:25.340
WRONG, YOU'RE SO STUPID!

01:30:25.340 --> 01:30:27.340
Stupid American!

01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:29.340
It's easy, come on.

01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:31.340
**knocking**

01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:33.340
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:35.340
Broke down Get Open Body Radio.

01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:37.340
WHAT THE F**K?

01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:41.340
You couldn't hear it?

01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:43.340
**unintelligible**

01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:53.340
I thought you were talking about the backbeat, the QQQ music I thought you were talking about.

01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:54.340
Oh, the beep.

01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:55.340
Yeah, oh, the beep.

01:30:55.340 --> 01:30:56.340
One more time.

01:30:56.340 --> 01:30:57.340
What the f***?

01:30:57.340 --> 01:31:06.340
Imagine a song where the tempo increases by one BPM every beat.

01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:09.340
Oh, we just got it.

01:31:09.340 --> 01:31:10.340
Okay, I'm gonna do that.

01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:13.340
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

01:31:13.340 --> 01:31:15.340
I'm spinning uncontrollably.

01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:17.340
I feel like Dr. Evil.

01:31:17.340 --> 01:31:18.340
Alright.

01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:19.340
Don't vomit.

01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:22.340
Uh, what else do I want to talk about? Oh yeah, I know!

01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:24.340
We're gonna do our cage match.

01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:25.340
We're gonna do a cage match?

01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:27.340
Yeah, remember I had my cell picked out because you have a new computer.

01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:29.340
Oh, well shit. Okay, so we're gonna do a cage match.

01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:32.340
Loki agreed, his song sucks, so we're throwing it out and we're starting new.

01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:34.340
So we have a new cage match.

01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:37.340
And in this week's cage match, I have to dig a little bit for Jamie's song.

01:31:37.340 --> 01:31:55.460
You know there's actually something about this one research group saying that bananas

01:31:55.460 --> 01:32:04.000
as we know them are going to be extinct in a few years?

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Why?

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Because we bleed them, huh?

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Why?

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Because they stick them up their vaginas.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
Why?

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Because it would be really interesting if they're a man.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Why?

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Because then they stick them up their ass.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Why?

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
I don't know, Rob, you tell us.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Why?

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Say something!

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Something.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Rap? Okay.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.000
I am here and my name is Chaos.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Well, Jamie, you ought to introduce this.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Born to Bone, the sand bone trio.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000
And what's it from?

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.000
From Guitarman.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.000
And why do you like it?

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
This is fucking rules.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Alright, here it is, the first entry of tonight's Sorens Off-Cage match.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:21.000
cage match born to be boned

01:36:44.000 --> 01:37:00.320
Yay, it's the Mariachi Riffic.

01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:03.080
I was born to be Boned, the Sambone Trio.

01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:05.880
First song in tonight's Orange Launch Cage Match.

01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:07.880
What did you think of that one, Jamie?

01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:08.880
Nine.

01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:09.880
Why?

01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:13.600
Because it's cool.

01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:17.600
It's probably my favorite song on that whole soundtrack of guitar music, so I'm gonna give it a 9.

01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:24.600
Mmm, I like that song, but I think if it wins too many weeks in a row, I'm gonna get sick of it really fast.

01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:28.600
So, I'll give it a good score this week, but next week you get a crappy score.

01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:30.600
So this week it gets, uh, 8 and a half.

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:33.600
Aw, son of a bitch.

01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:34.600
Uh oh.

01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:38.600
Oh, sorry, I just put in a CD that went to an extended CD.

01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:40.600
And this time I'm gonna let you read the track data either.

01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:42.600
Oh shit, it won't, huh?

01:37:42.600 --> 01:38:06.600
I'm trying to pick my cage match song and we're kind of doing this live on air. I kind of ran out. I just changed my mind at the last minute about what I wanted to play. So I ran out to get it. I want to see if I can get this to go.

01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:07.840
0.

01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:09.200
0.

01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:10.680
Okay.

01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:15.880
Give me just one second, and I'm gonna get my two out.

01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:18.560
Okay, here we go.

01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:21.440
I think I got it, so I'm gonna make sure this broadcast...

01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:22.560
Okay, my pick.

01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:26.840
She got my F you of the week last week, but this week I'm putting her in the cage match

01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:31.440
because well, I don't think any song I put in stands a chance against Sambone Trio, so

01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:32.640
why not lose big?

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:36.580
I'm gonna put in Madonna, and this is a brand new track from her new album, and it's not

01:38:36.580 --> 01:38:39.460
American life elite single because you guys are probably worn out on that by

01:38:39.460 --> 01:38:44.380
now but it's another track and to me the track is actually a bit beat nanny ish

01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:49.420
to me which is quite kind of why I like it it because it kind of progresses and

01:38:49.420 --> 01:38:52.820
it's a little silly the lyrics are kind of silly but it's an interesting song I

01:38:52.820 --> 01:38:56.100
think you guys might like it it's called mother and father and this is gonna be

01:38:56.100 --> 01:38:59.340
my case match pick for tonight and hopefully a place for you guys otherwise

01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:06.340
I'm gonna have to change it, so let's try it.

01:39:29.340 --> 01:39:39.340
There was a time that I prayed to Jesus Christ There was a time I had a mother, it was nice

01:39:48.340 --> 01:39:57.340
Nobody else would ever take the place of you Nobody else would do the things that you could do

01:39:57.340 --> 01:40:01.340
No one else I guess could hurt me like it did

01:40:01.340 --> 01:40:06.340
I didn't understand, I was just a kid

01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:10.340
Oh mother why aren't you here with me

01:40:10.340 --> 01:40:15.340
No one else saw things that you could see

01:40:15.340 --> 01:40:19.340
I'm trying hard to dry my tears

01:40:19.340 --> 01:40:24.340
Yes father you know I'm not so free

01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:29.100
I got to give it up Find someone to love me

01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:33.540
I got to let it go Find someone that I can care for

01:40:33.540 --> 01:40:37.900
I got to give it up Find someone to love me

01:40:37.900 --> 01:40:42.860
I got to let it go Find someone that I can care for

01:40:42.860 --> 01:41:01.100
There was a time I was happy in my life There was a time I believed I'd live forever

01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:10.220
There was a time that I prayed to Jesus Christ There was a time I had a mother, it was nice

01:41:10.220 --> 01:41:14.220
Oh mother, why aren't you here with me?

01:41:14.220 --> 01:41:19.220
No one else saw the things that you could see

01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:23.220
I'm trying hard to dry my tears

01:41:23.220 --> 01:41:28.220
Yes, father, you know I'm not so free

01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:30.220
I got to give it up

01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:32.220
Want someone to love me

01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:34.220
I got to let it go

01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:37.220
Want someone that I can care for

01:41:37.220 --> 01:41:39.220
I got to give it up

01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:43.220
Find someone to love me, I get to let it go

01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:46.220
Find someone that I can care for

01:41:46.220 --> 01:41:48.220
My mother died when I was five

01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:50.220
And all I did was sit and cry

01:41:50.220 --> 01:41:52.220
I cried and cried and cried all day

01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:55.220
Until the neighbors went away

01:41:55.220 --> 01:41:57.220
It couldn't take my loneliness, I couldn't take the phoniness

01:41:59.220 --> 01:42:02.220
My father had to go to work, I used to think he was a jerk

01:42:04.220 --> 01:42:06.220
I didn't know his heart was broken

01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:13.220
The word was spoken, he became a shadow of the father I was dreaming of

01:42:13.220 --> 01:42:15.220
I made a vow that I would never need another person

01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:18.220
Never turned my heart into a cage, a victim of a kind of rage

01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:26.220
I got to give it up

01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:28.220
I got to give it up

01:42:28.220 --> 01:42:31.220
I'm someone denying me love

01:42:31.220 --> 01:42:33.220
I got to let it go

01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:35.220
I'm someone that I can't care for

01:42:35.220 --> 01:42:37.220
I got to give it up

01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:49.220
Find someone that I can care for

01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:58.220
I got to give it up

01:42:58.220 --> 01:43:02.220
I got to give it up

01:43:02.220 --> 01:43:07.220
I've got to let it go I've got to give it all

01:43:07.220 --> 01:43:11.220
All my life All my life

01:43:11.220 --> 01:43:17.220
And my heart says to give it up

01:43:17.220 --> 01:43:42.260
That's it, that's Mother and Father by Madonna.

01:43:42.260 --> 01:44:00.260
So let's get reaction from the room on mother and father by Madonna Brad since I haven't

01:44:00.260 --> 01:44:06.620
heard really anything besides the single from the CD.

01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:11.500
I like the single better than this I guess I should compare it by itself.

01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:20.640
pretty good but it yeah I like it the reason why payments on you know what the

01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:24.000
more now that I'm listening to it in the context of this program that really was

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.800
a shitty cage max pick because it doesn't stand very well on its own it

01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:33.700
really goes with the rest of the album but I like that song in relation to the

01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:38.640
rest of it because it's very quirky and it's got I don't know it just sounds

01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:47.400
very old-school Madonna to me I don't know I don't know what do you think Jamie

01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:51.400
should we let Brad put a song in or we just want you to tell what's the song

01:44:51.400 --> 01:45:02.120
Brad well all right fine since nobody's gonna vote for that one I guess I don't

01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:05.120
I guess we have to give Sam Bone Trio a little competition.

01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:07.120
Let's see.

01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:09.120
Oh, Jesus.

01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:11.120
Alright, this is a good song.

01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:14.120
Alright, what's the song that you're putting in? Is this an audio CD?

01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:17.120
Yeah, it's audio, so pull up the trackers because I need to see the trackers first.

01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:50.400
Alright, this is my love for deep fried chicken.

01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:54.480
We're honorarily letting Brad put a song in because Loki's not here, so enjoy.

01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:59.480
We're rolling. This is the good one. Take five.

01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:26.980
I was raised in a cardboard box

01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:28.480
And before when I was single

01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:29.980
Used to hear the chicken jingle

01:46:29.980 --> 01:46:32.480
That's how I learned the chicken to rock

01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:34.480
When I'm in the mood to

01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:35.480
I got some other stuff

01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:37.980
And can't calm down to the fact

01:46:37.980 --> 01:46:39.480
I'm the one in my room here

01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:40.480
Sipping down the hill

01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:43.480
I'm screaming out to get in the middle of the night

01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:45.980
Hey you, hey you

01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:47.980
I'm thinking that you're so good

01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:50.980
I'm thinking that you're so good

01:46:50.980 --> 01:46:52.980
I'm thinking that you're so good

01:47:22.980 --> 01:47:25.980
It's easy but you can't lose, you just can't stop

01:47:25.980 --> 01:47:26.980
Oh, and I'm not a-workin'

01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:27.980
I'm pushin' and I'm surgein'

01:47:27.980 --> 01:47:30.980
And the boss is lookin' to tell me when

01:47:30.980 --> 01:47:31.980
I go and hold the baby

01:47:31.980 --> 01:47:32.980
Got my chicken, got me ready

01:47:32.980 --> 01:47:35.980
And we do the diggin' dance with you

01:47:35.980 --> 01:47:38.980
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

01:47:38.980 --> 01:47:41.980
I'm thinkin' that nigga's so good

01:47:41.980 --> 01:47:43.980
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:46.980
I'm thinkin' that nigga's so good

01:47:46.980 --> 01:47:49.980
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:51.700
Singin' it with the doggo

01:47:51.700 --> 01:47:54.940
Uh-huh, uh-huh-huh, uh-huh

01:47:54.940 --> 01:47:56.960
I'll take it back and get it on

01:47:56.960 --> 01:47:58.260
I'll take it back and get it on

01:48:03.260 --> 01:48:05.840
Candor and candor and candor and candor and

01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:07.200
Juicy, that's how you hear me

01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:10.460
Do the popcorn chicken

01:48:10.460 --> 01:48:13.480
Do the popcorn chicken

01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:16.140
Do the KFC

01:48:16.140 --> 01:48:18.820
Do the KFC

01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:23.820
To the buffalo wings

01:48:23.820 --> 01:48:28.820
Are you the pioneer?

01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:29.820
Can you take it?

01:48:29.820 --> 01:48:31.820
Yeah!

01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:34.820
We got the chickens

01:48:34.820 --> 01:48:36.820
Come on, get it up!

01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:39.820
We got the chickens cut

01:48:41.820 --> 01:48:45.820
Woohoo, I can't believe this

01:49:15.820 --> 01:49:19.820
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu Neo

01:49:19.820 --> 01:49:22.820
That chicken Hardware there so good

01:49:22.820 --> 01:49:32.820
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

01:49:36.820 --> 01:49:40.820
That was the Aquabats with Magic Chicken

01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:42.820
Uuuuuh Jamie what did you think of that

01:49:42.820 --> 01:49:48.820
I like Ska, but I don't think that that would work as a cage match song.

01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:50.820
As a song, it gets a 9.

01:49:50.820 --> 01:49:53.820
As a cage match pick, it gets a 4.

01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:55.820
Brad!

01:49:55.820 --> 01:49:59.820
I have to agree, I wasn't trying to make it compete with anything.

01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:03.820
I love the song, as a song, it gets a 10.

01:50:03.820 --> 01:50:06.820
But cage match is crap.

01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:09.820
So I wasn't trying, you know, that was just kind of a fuck up thing.

01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:20.820
Before we go on to you, I want to ask something. What is a Cave Match song? Is Cave Match just BeatMania style stuff? Trans-techno-dancey stuff?

01:50:20.820 --> 01:50:23.820
Songs that you'd want to hear regularly on Orange Wound's radio.

01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:34.820
That's what is, OKC. I had it all wrong. Next time I'll make sure to get something good that you want to hear, like Eminem or something. Slick motherfuckers. Sorry.

01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:41.820
Um, as for my opinions on the song, 11. Best cage match pick ever.

01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:43.820
Yo, you asshole.

01:50:43.820 --> 01:50:48.820
No, my favorite part of that song is when he's ratting off to different chicken places.

01:50:48.820 --> 01:50:54.820
It's not bad. You know what, it's very Guitar Freaks. I can see it in Guitar Freaks, totally.

01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:56.820
It sounds like you sang Pooh Pooh.

01:50:56.820 --> 01:50:59.820
Yeah, whatever, whatever, 7, whatever.

01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:05.820
Okay, so your entries, your possible votes, and send those votes to Sky in the chatroom right now.

01:51:05.820 --> 01:51:12.820
You can vote for the Sandbone Trio with Born to Be Bone, which is off a CD that's not it.

01:51:12.820 --> 01:51:16.820
Okay, you don't get clips of the songs tonight. If you don't remember them, you suck.

01:51:16.820 --> 01:51:23.820
So you get Born to Be Bone from the Sandbone Trio, the Aquabats with Magic Chicken, or Madonna with Mother and Father.

01:51:23.820 --> 01:51:25.820
And not Duck Toy.

01:51:25.820 --> 01:51:28.820
And not Ducktoy. If you vote for Ducktoy, you get kicked.

01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:34.820
So, send me your votes in the chatroom right now over a private message to Sky.

01:51:34.820 --> 01:51:37.820
Unless it's Sunday, because we're pre-taped this week.

01:51:37.820 --> 01:51:42.820
So if you know the super-secret time that we're taping, send them right now.

01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:48.820
If you're in the chatroom right now, I actually want to hold off just really fast.

01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:53.820
I want to get one more news story out in the open before we go to a break.

01:51:53.820 --> 01:51:55.180
Rob has a confession.

01:51:55.180 --> 01:51:56.540
I have a confession to make.

01:51:56.540 --> 01:52:00.180
I am homo sapien.

01:52:00.180 --> 01:52:02.220
OK.

01:52:02.220 --> 01:52:04.460
I don't know if you guys have heard about this yet, but have

01:52:04.460 --> 01:52:07.340
you ever been to those sites, Petition Online, like where

01:52:07.340 --> 01:52:08.700
you can sign petitions?

01:52:08.700 --> 01:52:10.260
And no one really gives a fuck about them?

01:52:10.260 --> 01:52:11.540
No one really cares.

01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:14.100
Like they had a petition to save Frenchie on American Idol

01:52:14.100 --> 01:52:16.020
that got like 500,000 signatures.

01:52:16.020 --> 01:52:17.500
You didn't do shit.

01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:21.700
Well, somebody decided, well, maybe we can get petitions to

01:52:21.700 --> 01:52:22.420
work for once.

01:52:22.420 --> 01:52:27.100
We're going to petition for Konami of Japan to release a new version of BeatMania 2DX

01:52:27.100 --> 01:52:28.100
to the consumer.

01:52:28.100 --> 01:52:31.100
However, there's a catch to this petition.

01:52:31.100 --> 01:52:32.100
I'll read this.

01:52:32.100 --> 01:52:36.160
This is a petition asking Konami for a new release of BeatMania 2DX, preferably seventh

01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:38.640
style for the Japanese PlayStation 2 console.

01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:42.080
For all fans who are looking forward to a new mix, please sign this petition, as it

01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:47.980
will be sent directly to Konami of Japan, either KCEJ or Konami Toyo.

01:52:47.980 --> 01:52:52.800
This is not a solo project and is part of a larger petition with major Japanese Bimani

01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:54.140
fan site.

01:52:54.140 --> 01:52:58.560
Any comments you add will be translated into Japanese and sent along with your name to

01:52:58.560 --> 01:52:59.560
Konami.

01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:01.980
That's kind of the catch.

01:53:01.980 --> 01:53:03.900
Thank you for supporting this petition.

01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:09.500
So if you want to go sign this petition, I'll post the link in the chat room right now and

01:53:09.500 --> 01:53:12.980
hopefully somebody will be kind enough to repaste it at this point in the show on Sunday

01:53:12.980 --> 01:53:13.980
when it rebroadcasts.

01:53:13.980 --> 01:53:24.100
But the website for this petition is petitiononline.com slash new2dx, but that's the number 2, not

01:53:24.100 --> 01:53:26.160
II, as you usually see it.

01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:32.660
So it's petitiononline.com slash NEW, the number 2, DX.

01:53:32.660 --> 01:53:37.220
So you can go sign that petition, and right now, there's quite a few.

01:53:37.220 --> 01:53:40.980
You've got 98 signatures on it so far, so not too bad.

01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:42.260
So you can go sign that right now.

01:53:42.260 --> 01:53:47.660
You'll be lucky 100 quick get in there right now. Okay, so that's what you can sign if you want to

01:53:48.340 --> 01:53:50.340
Petition for seventh style. What do you think of that? Jamie?

01:53:51.860 --> 01:53:53.860
What can it hurt, right?

01:53:54.820 --> 01:53:57.860
So this would be five whole seconds of my life I can never get back

01:53:58.580 --> 01:54:02.980
So after the break, we're gonna come back and yes for seven style after the break

01:54:02.980 --> 01:54:05.460
We're gonna come back and we're going to

01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:09.740
Announce a match winner and we're gonna club baby seals

01:54:09.740 --> 01:54:17.540
we're gonna have hot monkey sex and then we're gonna do a different last hour of

01:54:17.540 --> 01:54:21.940
the show then you'll wake up on an island with these shiny new necklaces

01:54:21.940 --> 01:54:27.620
and we'll explain what's gonna happen when we come back and I've got a queue

01:54:27.620 --> 01:54:34.780
up a break though so I'll break something Jamie give us a deep thought

01:54:34.780 --> 01:54:38.780
Sometimes I like to kick people in the nuts.

01:55:04.780 --> 01:55:07.780
We're not going to have monkey sex. We'll start with drunk monkey instead.

01:55:07.780 --> 01:55:09.780
We'll be back. You're listening to Orange Lawn Radio.

01:56:37.780 --> 01:56:58.780
Bye, bye, bye, bye

01:57:58.780 --> 01:58:25.780
No more will I wait, I've got to make a move

01:58:25.780 --> 01:58:27.780
You never did me wrong

01:58:27.780 --> 01:58:29.780
If you knew how I feel

01:58:29.780 --> 01:58:31.780
Baby, can't you see?

01:58:31.780 --> 01:58:34.780
To make you mind my heart

01:58:34.780 --> 01:58:37.780
I found things upside down

01:58:39.780 --> 01:58:41.780
How's you for you?

01:58:42.780 --> 01:58:46.780
Why don't you love me?

01:58:48.780 --> 01:58:51.780
Why don't you know how I think you feel?

01:58:51.780 --> 01:58:53.780
All I'm missing

01:58:53.780 --> 01:58:55.780
Love me

01:58:55.780 --> 01:58:56.780
When you're quickin'

01:58:56.780 --> 01:58:58.780
When you're clippin' and shakin'

01:58:58.780 --> 01:58:59.780
I've been too long

01:58:59.780 --> 01:59:00.780
I've stabbed my teeth

01:59:00.780 --> 01:59:01.780
And now I wanna catch you

01:59:01.780 --> 01:59:02.780
And make you yell

01:59:02.780 --> 01:59:06.780
Love me

01:59:06.780 --> 01:59:09.780
You're the city

01:59:09.780 --> 01:59:13.780
Again I'm with you

01:59:13.780 --> 01:59:17.780
In a moment of loss

01:59:17.780 --> 01:59:20.780
Last year we're counting down

01:59:20.780 --> 01:59:23.420
Did you really love me?

01:59:23.420 --> 01:59:27.420
Did you hold me tight?

01:59:27.420 --> 01:59:29.420
No more withering

01:59:29.420 --> 01:59:31.420
I've got to make a move

01:59:31.420 --> 01:59:33.420
You will never make me wrong

01:59:33.420 --> 01:59:37.420
If you knew how I did it, baby

01:59:37.420 --> 01:59:39.420
Can't you see?

01:59:39.420 --> 01:59:41.420
To make you find the mark

01:59:41.420 --> 01:59:45.420
I fell on things upside down

01:59:45.420 --> 01:59:49.420
I'm here for you

01:59:49.420 --> 01:59:56.420
why

01:59:57.620 --> 02:00:01.140
the

02:00:01.140 --> 02:00:04.140
hello are you are listening or radio

02:00:04.140 --> 02:00:08.540
we and tonight's age-match winner is

02:00:08.540 --> 02:00:11.300
big freaking surprise

02:00:11.300 --> 02:00:15.580
it's not that song it's the sam bone trio yay one

02:00:15.580 --> 02:00:17.460
big surprise

02:00:17.460 --> 02:00:19.460
All right, so that's tonight's Big Cage Mesh winner.

02:00:19.460 --> 02:00:22.660
Now we have an extra special treat for this evening.

02:00:22.660 --> 02:00:24.900
As you may or may not know, sometimes on the station when

02:00:24.900 --> 02:00:27.180
we're bored, we'll do a fuck-off show.

02:00:27.180 --> 02:00:31.060
So Jamie did one of these the other night, last night, right?

02:00:31.060 --> 02:00:33.420
Usually it's just me putting in a random comment and then

02:00:33.420 --> 02:00:34.740
playing five hours of music.

02:00:34.740 --> 02:00:37.100
And since we don't have a whole lot else to talk about

02:00:37.100 --> 02:00:39.760
tonight, we thought we'd treat you with an hour clip of one

02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:40.740
of these fuck-off shows.

02:00:40.740 --> 02:00:41.980
And it was fun, wasn't it, Jamie?

02:00:41.980 --> 02:00:45.180
Yeah, the theme of my fuck-off last night was stupid laws.

02:00:45.180 --> 02:00:46.500
Stupid laws.

02:00:46.500 --> 02:00:49.600
so that's going to take you out the last hour tonight show

02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:52.980
and then uh... it's all done you guys but before that

02:00:52.980 --> 02:00:54.740
yes

02:00:54.740 --> 02:01:00.220
already that we're going to do the outro of the show first and then go into that

02:01:00.220 --> 02:01:07.220
just do the fortune cookie okay

02:01:07.220 --> 02:01:09.280
all right here it is so this is it this is

02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:14.240
this is the normal fortune cookie for tonight here we go

02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:15.960
car theft is on the rise

02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:19.560
In America, a car is stolen every 12 seconds.

02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:21.640
What can you do to protect your car?

02:01:21.640 --> 02:01:24.360
An expensive car alarm system won't protect your car

02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:25.760
from being stolen.

02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:29.000
The club won't protect the valuables inside your car.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.560
But a big black guy named Ben can.

02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:34.280
Get away from the car, motherfucker.

02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:37.040
For less than you'd pay for an expensive car alarm system,

02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:39.240
and even less than you'd pay for the club,

02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:41.560
you can get a big black guy named Ben

02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:43.200
to protect your automobile.

02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:46.040
Get away from the car, motherfucker.

02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:47.400
It's simple to use.

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:49.920
Just leave the big black guy named Ben in your car

02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:52.760
whenever you get out, and he does the rest.

02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:54.960
Whenever anyone gets within six feet of your car,

02:01:54.960 --> 02:01:57.480
Ben simply gets out of the car and tells them.

02:01:57.480 --> 02:02:00.080
Get away from the car, motherfucker.

02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:02.120
Listen to these testimonials from people

02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:04.640
who use a big black guy named Ben.

02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:06.720
It's always nice to have someone to ride with,

02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:08.640
although he really doesn't say much.

02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:12.480
Just get away from the car, motherfucker.

02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:13.800
That's about it.

02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:16.440
I didn't get a big black guy named Ben to chat with.

02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:18.240
I got him to protect my car.

02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:21.260
It's the best investment I've ever made.

02:02:21.260 --> 02:02:22.960
My neighborhood isn't that great.

02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:24.640
There have been a lot of car theft.

02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:26.760
I can't tell you how many times I've heard it.

02:02:26.760 --> 02:02:29.000
Get away from the car, motherfucker.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.520
Knowing that I've got a big black guy named Ben protecting

02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:33.640
my car lets me sleep better at night.

02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:36.480
Call now 1-800-1-BIG-GUY.

02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:41.360
That's 1-800-1-B-I-G-G-U-Y. And instead of hearing this.

02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:45.160
You'll hear this.

02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:50.560
Get away from the car, motherfucker.

02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:52.840
Alright so, that's it.

02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:53.840
Goodnight you guys.

02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:55.940
Get away from the car, motherfucker.

02:02:55.940 --> 02:03:00.600
We're going to the tape bit now and so enjoy the next hour and thanks for joining us on

02:03:00.600 --> 02:03:04.260
this very special edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:03:04.260 --> 02:03:05.260
Final thought, Jamie?

02:03:05.260 --> 02:03:07.860
Um, you get to listen to how bad I snuck last night.

02:03:07.860 --> 02:03:11.280
Final thought, guys?

02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:15.280
Evan, final thought!

02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:17.280
What is the sound of cheese in the morning?

02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:18.280
Is it you?

02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:22.280
Or is it what you want to be?

02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:24.280
And my final thought is...

02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:25.280
PUSSY!

02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:26.280
Good night.

02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:27.280

02:57:12.800 --> 02:57:14.800
Oh, yay!

02:57:16.800 --> 02:57:18.800
It's an American type of ride

02:57:18.800 --> 02:57:21.800
The coast is the sun I get on type of ride

02:57:21.800 --> 02:57:24.800
Monster, monster, type of ride

02:57:24.800 --> 02:57:27.800
So young for not a young

02:57:27.800 --> 02:57:31.800
Time for wine

02:59:27.800 --> 02:59:36.800
Oh, you're in my life, in my dreams

03:00:36.800 --> 03:00:38.800
Oh

03:01:36.800 --> 03:01:38.800
Oh

03:03:36.800 --> 03:03:41.800
I don't know what you're looking for

03:03:41.800 --> 03:03:44.800
But if you don't know

03:03:44.800 --> 03:03:47.800
Then maybe you can see that

03:03:47.800 --> 03:03:53.800
I don't know what you're looking for

03:04:23.800 --> 03:04:50.000
And now it's time for more stupid laws!

03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:53.260
These are some Alabama state laws.

03:04:53.260 --> 03:04:55.960
dominoes may not be played on sunday

03:04:55.960 --> 03:05:00.580
it is illegal to wear a fake mustache that causes laughter in church

03:05:00.580 --> 03:05:03.900
putting salt on a railroad track may be punishable by death

03:05:03.900 --> 03:05:08.340
boogers may not be flicked into the wind

03:05:08.340 --> 03:05:10.980
uh... let's see

03:05:10.980 --> 03:05:13.060
masks may not be worn in public

03:05:13.060 --> 03:05:15.900
men may not spit in front of the opposite sex

03:05:15.900 --> 03:05:18.080
you may not drive barefooted

03:05:18.080 --> 03:05:24.400
It is illegal to impersonate a person of the clergy.

03:05:24.400 --> 03:05:30.360
And in Mobile, Alabama, it is unlawful to howl at ladies inside the city limits, and

03:05:30.360 --> 03:05:35.280
it is unlawful to wear women's pumps with sharp, high heels.

03:05:35.280 --> 03:05:41.000
And in Montgomery, it is considered an offense to open an umbrella on the street for fear

03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:42.000
of spooking horses.

03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:46.020
Of course, that's been repealed since then.

03:05:46.020 --> 03:05:52.580
And now that all of the neat, crappy laws are over, and I think that I'm going to go

03:05:52.580 --> 03:05:58.580
ahead and stop the recording right now and play some games.

03:05:58.580 --> 03:06:02.020

03:07:12.600 --> 03:07:16.600

03:07:19.600 --> 03:07:23.600
Star trekking across the universe

03:07:23.600 --> 03:07:26.600
On the star ship Enterprise, on the captain's ship

03:07:26.600 --> 03:07:30.600
Star trekking across the universe

03:07:30.600 --> 03:07:33.600
Fully going forward, still catch on research

03:08:33.600 --> 03:08:36.600
I'm the passion enterprise, I'm the catching curse

03:08:36.600 --> 03:08:39.600
Star trekking across the universe

03:08:39.600 --> 03:08:42.600
I'll be going forward and things are getting worse

03:08:48.600 --> 03:08:53.600
You cannot change the laws of physics

03:08:53.600 --> 03:08:54.600
Are we coming?

03:08:54.600 --> 03:08:56.600
Please shoot to kill, shoot to kill, shoot to kill

03:08:56.600 --> 03:08:59.600
We're coming, please shoot to kill, Scotty, bring me up, bitch

03:08:59.600 --> 03:09:01.600
Worse than that, eat that, Jim

03:09:31.600 --> 03:10:00.600
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:10:01.600 --> 03:10:08.600
So many nights we end up as computer stars

03:10:08.600 --> 03:10:17.600
And you believe in your life that she, she had it all set

03:10:17.600 --> 03:10:20.600
With you, with you, with you

03:10:20.600 --> 03:10:23.600
They know you just can't stop

03:10:23.600 --> 03:10:27.600
I wanna be with you, with you, with you

03:10:27.600 --> 03:10:29.600
Wherever you are

03:10:29.600 --> 03:10:35.600
You see you've been my heart Why do we speak out loud like this?

03:10:35.600 --> 03:10:43.600
I'd like to share the rhythm of a talking How can I keep repeating the same old lies?

03:10:43.600 --> 03:10:49.600
You and I, we've had this together Why do we speak out loud like this?

03:10:49.600 --> 03:10:57.600
I wanna spend the rest of my life with you How do we know we'll be together?

03:10:57.600 --> 03:11:00.600
I'll always do it this way, man

03:11:02.600 --> 03:11:08.600
My love won't do nothing to you

03:11:09.600 --> 03:11:16.600
And then I'm gonna make her be the one

03:11:46.600 --> 03:12:03.600
So many days we wasted under the sky, watching the sun go up and the compilers came.

03:12:03.600 --> 03:12:10.600
So many nights we ended up completed stars.

03:12:10.600 --> 03:12:16.100
And you really are like that, she, she held me the same day

03:12:16.100 --> 03:12:19.100
With you, with you, with you

03:12:19.100 --> 03:12:22.600
The universe is on its side

03:12:22.600 --> 03:12:26.600
I wanna be with you, with you, with you

03:12:26.600 --> 03:12:30.600
Wherever you are, you see you in my eyes

03:12:30.600 --> 03:12:34.100
Why do we sit down like this?

03:12:34.100 --> 03:12:37.600
I like to share the little more I told you

03:12:37.600 --> 03:12:41.600
How can I keep repeating the same old lies?

03:12:41.600 --> 03:12:44.600
You and I, we've ever seen this on you

03:12:44.600 --> 03:12:48.600
Why do we stick around like this?

03:12:48.600 --> 03:12:51.600
I won't expect the rest of my life to do

03:12:51.600 --> 03:12:55.600
Why do we know we'll be together?

03:12:55.600 --> 03:13:00.600
I wanna do it this way, man

03:13:00.600 --> 03:13:07.600
Man and woman do nothing to you

03:13:07.600 --> 03:13:15.600
Man and woman make up in the wild

03:13:15.600 --> 03:13:20.600
So many moments ago

03:14:20.600 --> 03:14:35.600

Another day in my work is all done

03:27:03.080 --> 03:27:06.440
I can leave all my cares behind now

03:27:07.200 --> 03:27:10.000
I'm out to play I'm gonna have me some fun

03:27:10.000 --> 03:27:13.000
In a world that is totally mine

03:27:23.000 --> 03:27:26.000
I'm gonna fall, feel myself run out of light

03:27:26.000 --> 03:27:29.000
No, they just can't take your fear

03:27:30.000 --> 03:27:33.000
I will turn it over, I'll feel it inside

03:27:33.000 --> 03:27:36.000
Feel my head come to my feet

03:27:36.000 --> 03:27:41.000
My life ends up being a long, dark, life

03:27:41.000 --> 03:27:44.000
Naturalize me with no fear

03:27:44.000 --> 03:27:48.000
As the morning happens, I'm doing this live

03:27:48.000 --> 03:27:51.240
I blow my heart down to my knees

03:29:48.000 --> 03:30:15.360
This is the way we dance, this is the way we rock, this is the way we vibe

03:30:15.360 --> 03:30:18.360
As we demonstrate, as we demonstrate, straight

03:30:18.360 --> 03:30:20.360
Everybody wants a piece of the pie

03:30:20.360 --> 03:30:21.360
Pots, amigos, miso, ah

03:30:21.360 --> 03:30:23.360
Cosas, rosas, la gabe de ador, the fight

03:30:23.360 --> 03:30:25.360
Cos I spy, let me fly

03:30:25.360 --> 03:30:26.360
This is the way we dance

03:30:26.360 --> 03:30:28.360
This is the way we rock

03:30:28.360 --> 03:30:29.360
This is the way we ride

03:30:29.360 --> 03:30:32.360
As we demonstrate, as we demonstrate

03:30:49.360 --> 03:30:50.360
This is the sound

03:30:52.360 --> 03:30:53.360
This is the sound

03:30:54.360 --> 03:30:55.360
Everybody wants a piece of the pie

03:30:55.360 --> 03:30:57.360
Pulsing me that means the eye

03:32:57.360 --> 03:33:02.360
with a series of unintended threats to be more microphone and pepper.

03:33:27.360 --> 03:33:42.360
Get up in the mornin' it's a crack and a thong You also like your house all day

03:33:42.360 --> 03:33:52.360
You think that a man has to do for a livin' That we keep the reaper away

03:33:52.360 --> 03:33:54.760
Things that a man has to do for a living

03:33:54.760 --> 03:33:56.860
Have to keep the reaper away

03:33:57.360 --> 03:33:59.360
Somebody give me a break

03:33:59.360 --> 03:34:01.860
I've had a bunch that nobody can take

03:34:01.860 --> 03:34:03.360
Nobody did you

03:34:03.360 --> 03:34:04.360
Nobody sees you

03:34:04.360 --> 03:34:07.360
Nobody ever breaks free from life

03:34:10.860 --> 03:34:13.360
Bad city, bad, bad city

03:34:13.360 --> 03:34:15.360
Bad city, bad

03:34:15.360 --> 03:34:17.860
Bad city, bad, bad city

03:34:17.860 --> 03:34:20.360
Bad city, bad

03:35:20.360 --> 03:35:30.360
We should gather around the yard We should gather around the corner

03:35:30.360 --> 03:35:40.360
We took a crucial road And we never dreamed so

03:35:40.360 --> 03:35:42.360
Oh

Baby, give me your love, I'm the one who should give you love

03:37:54.360 --> 03:37:58.360
I'm looking to be dead through the dawn

03:37:59.360 --> 03:38:01.360
Can you clearly see?

03:38:01.360 --> 03:38:03.360
I could give you more than time

03:38:04.360 --> 03:38:08.360
You call me friend but you can't most believe

03:38:09.360 --> 03:38:11.360
I want to live

03:38:11.360 --> 03:38:13.360
There is more to me

03:38:14.360 --> 03:38:16.360
When late at night

03:38:16.360 --> 03:38:18.660
You're all I need
