249	2713	Message for you, son!
3113	3935	Attention!
5016	8481	Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
10504	15571	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.
19188	21889	Orange Lounge may contain adult cunt.
22189	25370	Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
25930	28651	Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
29191	32092	Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
32872	33292	Just kidding.
33492	35073	Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.
35293	42775	In this episode... Hey, are there any balls down there?
43015	45496	That's the biggest berry you've ever seen, Jingleberry.
45576	46896	What's your favorite sugar?
48737	49317	Showgirls.
50218	51338	Absolutely frightful.
51618	52319	What's yours?
52439	54920	There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.
54980	56181	Don't torture yourself.
56861	57662	That's my job.
57802	59783	Now's the time on sprockets, baby dogs!
59863	62764	I'll get you, my pretty.
62904	64285	And your little dog, too.
64705	65526	I know Kung Fu.
66006	68347	I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
68627	70448	Why did they have to take the word gay?
72089	72689	No!
72729	75851	What I expect from Spanish exposition is gender.
75911	76171	Hey!
78683	80504	DarkSakura, Shut up!
80684	81384	Where's my gun?
81484	83845	This is my boomstick!
83905	86426	Sky, Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!
86726	90487	Loki, I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.
90527	93328	What kind of warping being would find that funny?
93548	101111	Orange Lounge Radio We are live, but not really.
101551	103592	And this is episode number 42 for April the 27th of 2003.
107119	112181	You're tuned into the Bomani Scene's most premeditated radio station of all things, the money.
113161	115202	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
115942	120724	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.
121744	122945	You know her better as DarkSakra.
123725	125726	Or tonight, as her name tag says, Miss Pac-Man.
129307	130487	I like your shirt, that's a cool shirt.
131308	131688	It's retro.
131708	131908	It's retro.
133961	138363	Uh, Loki is out today because he's doing stuff.
139104	140324	He broke his track record again.
140665	141745	I know, it's amazing.
142185	144366	I don't know what he's doing tonight, he's just doing stuff.
146848	147508	Yeah, he's fepping.
149369	150469	He's pecking and fepping.
150870	153471	Um, actually, we have a secret.
154111	155772	We're not really live tonight.
156512	157453	No, we're really dead.
158013	158634	We're actually...
160084	161887	Unless it's Thursday for you right now.
161947	167473	If it is Thursday the 24th, then yes, we're live.
167834	170216	Because we're premature this week.
172119	174902	We came a little early this week to your sound waves.
179607	187232	Um, yeah, so it's going to be an interesting show tonight because there's just, there's really not a lot tonight.
188092	196478	It's just, it's just Jamie and me and we might have one special guest who's around here somewhere and we're just going to talk about stuff.
197038	197318	Yeah.
197418	202621	We're both in, Jamie and I are both kind of in moods where we just don't give a fuck.
202641	202981	Yeah.
204648	205629	My socks are stripy.
207250	208571	Yo, I like your socks, they're pretty.
208591	210553	Sam said that I look like the little bitch that you are.
211394	212675	I'll get you if I break you.
212695	213436	Does he know?
214196	217779	Yeah, so let's take a quick break.
217799	220882	We're going to start off with some old school 5K songs.
221783	222744	Visit our chat room.
224305	226287	Calibamani.com, click on Orange Lounge, click on chat.
274112	274853	Thanks for watching!
321129	326973	In the city where the light of the sun shines, that person left a shadow and disappeared.
327053	328934	I loved you with a sudden goodbye.
329014	331236	I realized at that time.
331276	334298	Memories wake up when I forget them in a dream.
347683	364076	I love you, we looked at each other, we hugged each other, you kissed me Even if it was just a casual kiss, I knew it I knew there was no such thing as a painful past Once again, just a little bit more, I want to shake your hand
382995	383836	Thank you for watching!
450521	456064	Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange and Orange Bay Money Music and More show?
456364	463508	The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.
463828	465869	It's unearthly.
466049	469771	It's like being in a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.
470171	474354	Hey, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 42.
475054	477395	And tonight, we're being a little bit sneaky.
477435	479036	We're actually pre-taped tonight.
480477	483279	But that doesn't mean there isn't a party going on when we're not around.
483299	487601	Mommy and Daddy aren't home in the chat room, so I'm sure there's plenty of people causing a commotion.
487681	489282	So go on in there and party with them.
489563	492664	They're over at www.callybomani.com.
493025	495486	And you click on Orange Lounge, and then you click on Chat.
496347	498088	And join all our obsessive creatures.
498128	498768	I don't click on Chat.
500276	502497	Yeah, don't click on that button that says don't click me.
503378	506579	Yeah, don't click on the one that says big piles of poopy.
507580	508680	Click here for Goat Say.
511181	511562	Yuck.
512742	514783	That was another April Fool's joke.
514843	523267	I was like, how can you do Goat Say radio?
523428	527109	Maybe next year for April Fool's we can play gay porn over the air.
528889	535012	I'll pipe in my yaoi collection.
536113	539134	Oh my god, I finally did monkey sex on Orange Lounge.
541135	543797	Pooh, I sing pooh.
544537	544997	Pooh.
546398	548979	What was it I was watching that had the monkey jacking off?
551501	553702	Well, Conan O'Brien has the masturbating bear.
554807	560009	No, it was I think a video tape of these people at the zoo when the monkey was blinking.
561310	562790	They show that on cable or something?
562890	565051	I don't remember.
565671	568812	That's one of those Skinamax clips you got to pay extra for.
570453	572854	Oh my god, I watched the blue girl live action.
573507	575049	La Blue Girl Live Action.
575129	576270	God, it was horrible.
576410	578692	Describe La Blue Girl for the uninitiated.
578712	579593	Tentacle Pond.
581895	582836	It was an anime.
582936	586920	It was really crappy, but oh my god, I never need to see that again.
586940	588642	It was like volume three or something.
588662	590784	Oh, so there's more than one?
591204	592626	Yeah, it's like a story.
594367	596569	Is the acting as bad as it was in the anime?
596589	596830	Yeah.
598118	603559	Actually, there was some decent acting, but other than that, it was a little like, Oh, it's a garden hose!
603759	605860	Oh, it's going in my mouth!
606540	609661	It looked like they were, like, spitting up vegetable oil.
612902	615262	I neglected to introduce our special guest tonight.
615342	616342	Hi to Brad, by the way.
618063	620123	Um... Oh, shit.
620323	623184	I had something I was going to say.
623224	623484	Yes.
624404	624764	Suck it!
624824	625425	Suck it good!
625445	625925	Uh-uh.
627512	628173	Oh, I hit his teeth.
629334	629954	Oh, my bad.
630635	631435	I'm going to wipe it off now.
631475	631916	Excuse me.
633697	634878	That's really good radio.
639162	641744	Today, we're painting on Orange Lounge Radio.
643746	645127	We're going to make a happy cloud.
645788	647549	Happy white clouds.
647589	649571	Happy white clouds with cocaine.
653214	654976	I was so sad when Bob Ross died.
662810	667511	What other people have died recently that made me go, Mr. Rogers?
667751	668491	Oh, Nell Carter.
668551	669211	She was cool.
669231	669471	Shut up.
669551	670791	I like Nell Carter.
672472	672852	She was cool.
672872	673892	I used to watch Gimme a Break.
673912	674272	Gimme a Break?
674312	676512	Oh, I don't know.
687208	689650	So, yeah, interesting week for us.
689750	693853	I think we've all just been very busy and doing, like, random sorts of things.
693893	695615	Like, it's been like a crazy week for me.
695635	697316	My car passed smog.
697536	699878	Your car passed smog?
699998	700299	Yay!
700839	703601	Yeah, doing 50.
704882	705963	It's been really random.
706604	706964	Yeah?
707104	708906	I've been working on pictures.
709026	709987	I have a desk lamp.
710867	711167	Cool.
711488	713409	It clips onto my shelf.
714030	716492	It makes things bright so I don't go blind when I draw.
717352	717933	Thanks for watching!
740393	741914	It's a tongue twister, nipple clamp lamp.
743876	745377	That's the new erotic song, isn't it?
746338	748639	Yes, the new erotic single, nipple clamp lamp.
748760	751001	Yeah, it's the B-side to temple of butt.
753083	764131	You know what's interesting is that Dark Tetsuya, who's an obsessive listener of this show, pointed out in the chat room a while back that actually in an earlier episode, and he cites episode 12,
765928	770392	I apparently actually said something about Mr. Rogers is not dead.
770932	771513	Or something like that.
771573	772554	I don't remember the exact quote.
772574	773775	Yeah, at that point Mr. Rogers was not dead.
773815	774895	Yeah, at that point Mr. Rogers was not dead.
774915	776437	It was just funny that we brought it up on the show.
776937	781020	By the way, and I appreciate our listeners.
782082	782923	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
806793	808094	Do you remember episode 3?
808134	808174	No.
808614	809775	Oh my god, I wasn't here.
809835	810555	Yeah, you weren't here.
810595	811315	I remember that.
811416	815358	Because I remember when Orange Lounge Radio started, you were here the first week.
815418	816758	We had everybody here the first week.
816798	818999	And then the second and third week, it was like, I'm going to Anime Expo.
819019	819320	Bye.
820140	821481	That was it, too.
821921	823362	I was like, I'm in L.A.
824182	824322	Bye.
824483	825924	I'm in San Diego.
826185	826565	Bye.
827966	830549	And then we were just kind of here without Jamie for a couple weeks.
830589	831711	And then I went to Alabama.
832051	832451	Bye.
833593	835755	Oh, I'm stuck in traffic in San Francisco.
836336	839900	I don't think... Did the show... Was Alabama... I thought Alabama happened before.
840080	841561	We've been doing the show since...
842742	842982	June 23rd.
843002	843162	June 23rd.
867685	868708	Who else would I hire?
868888	875967	Matt Jamie or Matt But, oh well Not me I'm just a show delinquent It's all good
877785	878966	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
904366	906008	So, God, what else is new this week?
907409	911813	It's such an interesting show tonight because there's just nothing to talk about.
911873	913955	You call that interesting?
915036	917239	I know, aren't you excited about tonight's show?
917259	919020	Hey, listeners, I know how to get you excited.
919060	920021	Go download some porn.
920462	920862	It's funny.
920942	921743	Let's just get drunk.
921783	922364	That'll be funny.
923344	923905	I'm just kidding.
924766	926087	Actually, I don't work tomorrow.
926107	926828	I can get drunk, sure.
928525	934487	Let's just pretend we're getting drunk, and then if the show's really bad because we're lagging, we can just say we were drunk, sorry.
935988	940970	Jamie will get drunk and I'll get high, and then you'll be sober, so it'll have the best of all of our lives.
941510	945152	Why don't I... You can get drunk, you can get high, and I'll have sex.
947953	949073	I'll be in the other room.
949093	950114	Sounds like the real world.
950134	953435	No, because we need to have, we need...
955495	956335	We need a black person.
957476	961157	We need either an Asian or a Pacific Islander.
963257	967198	We need to have... Yeah, we need a person with bad hygiene.
967278	969519	We need everybody to hate somebody else.
969579	972260	We need the racist.
972680	974400	And the racist has to be a roommate with a black person.
974420	974821	We have Loki.
975961	976441	We have Loki.
978709	979890	I don't know where Loki is tonight.
979950	982131	He just said he wouldn't be available tonight.
982171	989675	I think he's either fapping or he's probably getting ready for the movie on Saturday, which is one reason we're taped tonight.
990175	993917	Maybe he's having special time with a significant other.
994057	995257	That's possible, too.
996638	998079	Who has time for relationships?
998179	998779	I sure don't.
1000600	1004322	Yeah, see, there's like a special on The Matrix tonight, so...
1006914	1009035	Well, there is a little bit of news.
1009115	1010035	Actually, there's a lot of news.
1010075	1010955	We're just being lazy.
1012216	1014337	We're procrastinating for next week.
1014737	1016577	Who said we'd bring you news timely?
1016678	1017098	Come on.
1018138	1018818	You know what I realized?
1018838	1019879	We kind of lied last week.
1020259	1020599	We did?
1020759	1025061	We said that last week was the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio from this studio.
1025781	1027601	But we're actually in the studio tonight.
1028042	1029642	Tonight's the last episode in the studio.
1030863	1031703	Even though we're pre-taped.
1033996	1034597	I'm confused.
1034617	1035397	I just went cross-eyed.
1035437	1035698	Yeah.
1036038	1036678	I want ice cream.
1037339	1038080	Let's go get ice cream.
1038100	1038680	Fuck this show.
1039081	1040422	Bye.
1041963	1042904	I had salad today.
1043384	1043685	Did you?
1043985	1044345	From where?
1044906	1045686	The grocery store.
1045827	1046747	Did you toss your salad?
1046887	1048529	Yes, I did, actually.
1048609	1049610	It landed on the cat.
1049870	1050511	You know what's funny?
1051051	1055115	I had a salad today, too, and I shook my salad.
1059187	1062409	Alright, uh, one interesting thing that's in Bomani News this week.
1062469	1066931	Dancemania EX3 just came out, and I don't have a copy, and I want one.
1067331	1068372	So somebody get me one.
1068392	1069952	What the fuck's on this one this time?
1069992	1070493	Get this.
1070753	1072293	Ace of Base, first track.
1072333	1073054	How cool is that?
1075675	1076556	Jamie's blinking.
1077856	1081258	Um... This is great.
1081318	1085260	Creamy has a song on Dancemania EX3 called Help, I'm a Fish.
1086001	1086601	Cool!
1088222	1089382	I have to listen to that.
1089642	1090122	Oh my god.
1090142	1092103	Yes, track six is called Help, I'm a Fish.
1092883	1102147	New Smile DK, new Captain Jack, new Bus Stop, new 2 Unlimited, new DJ Alligator, new Lasco, which is like no surprise if you've been following the EX series.
1104007	1107689	A trance remix of Erotic, Gimme Gimme Gimme, the 2003 mix.
1108409	1114031	And then another creamy song, a remix of I Do, I Do, I Do.
1118823	1120524	I'm looking forward to Help I'm a Fish.
1120584	1122985	As soon as we get a copy of that, we'll play that for y'all.
1123045	1123605	That'll be fun.
1125006	1128687	And Bus Stop, it looks like this time around, is covering I Was Made for Loving You.
1130788	1132669	I was made for loving you, baby.
1132809	1135030	You know, the only way I remember that song is through Moulin Rouge.
1135050	1136770	I've never seen that.
1137050	1138451	I know, you've never seen Moulin Rouge.
1138471	1139631	We've got to make you watch that sometime.
1140032	1147034	But there's this part where they, you know, they're going back and forth between all these love songs, and then there's that part where I was made for loving you, baby.
1147054	1148335	You were made for loving me.
1149739	1151520	I should never sing on this show.
1152561	1152901	Yes.
1153862	1154162	Indeed.
1155043	1156284	I might.
1157685	1160807	Any other fun Dance Mania albums coming out that we should give a mention to?
1161548	1164910	Dance Mania, my ass mixer.
1164950	1165630	What'll be on that?
1166591	1168292	I was made for Party On You.
1169353	1169874	Beautiful.
1170894	1171335	Lovely.
1171595	1172836	I was made for Stiffy Glue.
1176763	1179245	Other fun, happy, fun news this week.
1181526	1185708	This has nothing to do with Bomani, but a lot of you that follow Bomani also follow Konami.
1186389	1190071	And Konami has another game series that's somewhat popular.
1190551	1191571	It's known a little bit.
1192132	1193112	It's Castlevania.
1194453	1195213	And get this.
1195874	1199296	The new Castlevania is coming out.
1199496	1200016	And look at that.
1200716	1200917	It's 3D.
1202228	1203428	Are you on Castlevania Dungeon?
1203588	1203828	Yes.
1204989	1208730	Okay, wait a second, but the last time I tried to do a 3D Castlevania game, it sucked shit.
1208790	1212851	Wait, I'm not sure this is new.
1213511	1214431	Yeah, it was up yesterday.
1217312	1218112	Okay, you know what?
1219092	1220173	But this is what it says at the bottom.
1220213	1228355	It says, the article says this game will be entirely in 3D, but is not intended to be like Castlevania 64, which the producer openly admitted to hating.
1229670	1233054	The game takes place in the 11th century, apparently, but other story details are pretty vague.
1233114	1234776	God damn it, they need to do another one with Richter.
1234796	1239281	Everybody pray to whatever god you believe in that this game does not suck, please.
1239622	1241244	They need another game with Richter.
1245028	1248753	Or as Maria said it in the English version, Richter.
1262785	1265346	Um, you know, you're forgetting another comic game.
1265847	1266247	What's that?
1266587	1268728	Freaking Gradius V. When's that come out?
1269329	1269649	New.
1269989	1270609	It's soon.
1271009	1271670	It's new!
1271690	1273311	I think it's soon.
1273671	1275112	Gradius V on PS2.
1276212	1277173	On the piece of shit 2.
1277213	1277513	Sorry.
1278293	1280394	I don't know what it is.
1281555	1288639	Now... Just because they took, like, parts out of old, like, space shuttles and stuff to make this thing doesn't mean it's, like, it doesn't do that.
1290822	1295046	I just think people can't program for it for shit, or else we would definitely have games that looked better.
1300252	1303996	Metal Gear Solid 2 was nice, but it was better on Xbox, I have to say.
1304596	1308140	It, it, because there was more room for anti-aliasing.
1308280	1308380	Oh!
1308941	1309041	Oh!
1309825	1309985	Oh!
1310545	1311166	Oh my god!
1311186	1311786	You know what?
1311806	1314227	Tekken 3 and Metal Gear Solid on Bling.
1314327	1314708	Bling bling.
1335894	1337054	I don't know.
1337435	1339095	I have nothing really to say on Castlevania.
1339235	1339916	You know what's interesting?
1340436	1345839	I don't own a PlayStation 2 American, and I'm not really going to be importing any games outside of...
1346639	1349181	I'm gonna be getting Final Fantasy 7 too, hopefully next month I've already seen the ending
1367133	1367774	No spoilers.
1368754	1370896	You could just get a mod chip and, you know.
1370916	1371676	No.
1371736	1372037	Why?
1372457	1375939	Because any other game that's going to come out after that is not going to work.
1375959	1380563	Okay, I used to say that when the PS2 just came out because it's understandable, you know, it just came out.
1380623	1386367	But now PS2's kind of, it's starting to become the end of its life and all the best games that are out, I mean.
1386387	1391571	So how about when you, if you mod your system now and then 7th style comes out and it won't work with your system?
1392051	1402267	Then I'll go buy 7thfile I mean, 7thfile will work as a purchased version I don't need to take pictures of it to play it And 7thfile won't come out What?
1402648	1403029	What, Rob?
1403169	1403349	What?
1404210	1404411	Well...
1405101	1413448	I've heard that before about, you know, that you get the mod chip and then Sony could release a game that would basically fuck up your mod chip.
1413669	1416651	Or, you know, they override the copy protection, kind of like they did with the early chips on PS1s.
1416671	1419013	Sony was even doing it right to the end of the PlayStation's life.
1419173	1419373	Right.
1419694	1425359	And what's interesting about that is what they could do with it is they could do it through online purposes.
1425899	1429802	It's possible, you know, if your PS2 is online, you go online with Final Fantasy XI...
1430984	1438499	And then, sneak sneak, it's updating your BIOS That's why I just won't play it on the computer Because it's coming out for computer in America
1439151	1452922	By the way, if anyone is interested in that, if you go to squareenixusa.com, you can submit an application to beta test Final Fantasy XI for PC or for PS2.
1452942	1455324	I really hope they choose me to do the beta test.
1455344	1459247	Please, please, Square, I've played your game since the beginning.
1459287	1460028	Well, not since the beginning.
1460068	1463750	I'm more than positive I'm going to get selected because I've done game beta testing before.
1465312	1466613	I played Ragnarok Online, ew.
1467301	1472125	Yeah, that sucks they didn't continue that over here, because I really want to play Ragnarok.
1472145	1472786	You lucky people.
1472806	1474027	They're still in beta testing right now.
1474047	1478010	Yeah, but it's like they're only working with... The paid release is going to be out, I think, for the next couple months.
1478050	1480432	And they are going to America with it?
1480492	1482173	Because it sounded like they were neglecting America.
1482213	1484355	They have an American beta test open right now.
1484916	1488619	Well, I mean, it's a closed beta, but they have it going on right now.
1488659	1495925	I know it's been talked about on here, but for those who don't know, Ragnarokonline.com, I don't know how it's spelled, R-A-G-N-O-R...
1497034	1499857	R-A-G-N-A-R, okay.
1500358	1500678	Okay.
1502380	1505443	It's a really cool game, it's like Secret of Mana online or something, kind of.
1506284	1506924	Is that what you'd say?
1507104	1507485	Yeah.
1508446	1511028	It's 3D environment, 2D characters.
1511689	1517955	That's actually what I was thinking, is that every time I see Ragnarok online, I go, God, I really want to play a Secret of Mana online.
1519414	1519895	Seriously.
1520636	1520857	R.O.
1520837	1522079	's about the closest you can get.
1522179	1526086	It's like, it's like Secret of Mana with Final Fantasy Tactics type job systems.
1526406	1527749	And grasshoppers that play the fiddle.
1528891	1530293	Fucking fiddle playing grasshoppers.
1531423	1531603	POPCAP.COM
1561473	1563794	It still needs a lot of tweaking, but it's interesting.
1563814	1564675	It's worth checking out.
1564695	1566576	Go to popcap.com because it's free.
1567396	1569757	I think if you pay money, you get special things.
1569817	1573459	Hey, I'm still doing Neopets, okay?
1574559	1576500	I have not checked on my Neopet in two weeks.
1576520	1577701	I don't want to give you my money.
1581428	1583009	If you're loving your pet, give me your money.
1583410	1583850	Why?
1584450	1587593	So that I can get up to 500,000.
1588774	1589574	I think I have like 25,000.
1589634	1591876	That's actually about what I need.
1592877	1593257	Really?
1594138	1594698	Mwahaha.
1595359	1600002	Seriously, I've been trying to get up to... Is that like the last level of saving?
1600263	1601844	No, that's about three from it.
1602524	1605687	I'm trying to upgrade to my next bank account.
1607978	1610340	Okay, why don't we take ourselves a quickie little break.
1610440	1611001	We're going to come back.
1611041	1612883	We're going to talk about Max 2.
1612923	1617407	Max 2, Japan, came out this week, and there's been some interesting early reaction.
1617767	1622252	We're sitting here on Thursday night, pre-taping Sunday's show, and there's already been some early reaction.
1622272	1627076	Some folks in the States have picked it up and have some interesting things to say about it.
1627156	1628598	So we will take a quick break.
1629078	1630920	About the overwhelming lack of monkeys.
1631385	1632847	Yes, about the lack of monkey sex.
1632887	1635410	We're going to play some Anothers for the hell of it.
1636211	1639615	We're feeling saucy, so let's start this off with Spica, Another.
1640096	1641598	And we'll be back on Orange Lounge Radio.
1688445	1688828	and many more.
1864922	1865965	Thanks for watching!
1979648	1981409	Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
1981629	1984150	Because Bongo demands it.
1985670	1987091	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
1987111	1988131	I hope you enjoyed those and others.
1988191	1990232	It was Spica, Leading Cyber, and Reincarnation.
1990272	1990532	You know what?
1990552	1992753	I've actually never heard Reincarnation and others before.
1993253	1997254	Because usually I'm too chicken to play and others on 2DX because I don't want to waste my money.
1998715	2000355	Shut up.
2002316	2004457	And I was sitting here going, this song isn't any different.
2004577	2006237	And then finally they're like, wait.
2006397	2007478	Jamie and Brad are like, wait.
2007818	2008478	Wait for it.
2008820	2009720	Wait for it!
2010040	2020204	And then finally in the end it has that... It has a little way different part at the end, so... What a cool... Roll to see if I'm getting drunk.
2021885	2023365	Alright, you're getting drunk!
2025206	2025906	Blink, blink.
2025926	2027047	Got any Mountain Dew?
2032109	2034850	We're talking about the potential...
2035785	2036626	Battle Royale
2052243	2054104	is basically what it has come down to.
2054584	2065627	You've got this little inside cult of folks here locally in Sacramento and abroad because it's kind of spawned from the Orange Lounge chat room and then some of just this obsession with the movie Battle Royale.
2066147	2072769	And now... I'm running a game probably in a few weeks.
2072970	2076811	Me and Jas and now Pepe's involved.
2078024	2080747	And Puppy's testing his dice script in our chat room right now.
2081487	2085651	But, um, we're, uh, yeah, it's gonna be definitely dice-based.
2085852	2089315	Um, let's go ahead and give a couple little spoilers about that.
2089836	2092318	We've already selected what the random weapons are.
2092698	2092999	Ooh.
2094147	2101988	We have already, there's going to be, people are going to have certain skills like people normally do.
2102148	2106009	You've got your stats, we'll help you with that.
2106649	2114211	I'm sort of half deciding of having the game last a few weeks more than just the normal, however many it takes to kill everybody off.
2114791	2120752	So you can establish what your character's like and your friends and your group before you decide to kill each other off.
2121815	2123116	So how exactly is it going to work?
2123156	2125979	Is it going to be like a chat room that runs 24 hours a day?
2126079	2126259	No.
2126579	2128140	No, it's only going to be a certain day and time.
2128381	2134205	It's going to be probably three hours, the game should last, or until we say, okay, we're tired.
2134706	2134946	Got it.
2135126	2136447	And it's going to be one night a week.
2137288	2141592	I'll do my best to put it on a Friday night.
2141832	2143934	I'm thinking a Friday night would be the best night for this.
2145675	2172558	and basically you roleplay and if you suck at roleplay by the way as in you're not staying in character you're not developing your character even though your character is going to die you'll just die all the faster because I'm a pretty spiteful GM which is probably why I will not be participating because I suck at roleplay I was always there to provoke the GM in interesting ways
2175181	2181367	I sometimes think that it's a little bit easier to roleplay online as opposed to tabletop.
2181567	2186071	Just because you have a little bit more room for some description.
2187012	2192818	If you're a shy person by nature, you don't have to say something that you would normally be uncomfortable saying.
2192858	2193758	It's easier to type it.
2195340	2197902	Ah, you need to roleplay and say that in a British accent.
2197922	2198823	Yes.
2201773	2206797	Anyway, as promised... Oh yeah, Brad, do you have something you want to say?
2206957	2207097	No.
2207117	2207317	Okay.
2207717	2209439	As we promised before the break... I killed you!
2211200	2215043	We were going to talk about... Max 2 just came out in Japan this week.
2215923	2220867	And there's probably more information on it now that it's Sunday, but it's only Thursday when we're taping here.
2221447	2223229	And we don't know a lot at this point.
2223309	2226791	However, we do know what the unlocks are.
2227552	2227752	So...
2228883	2233228	The unlocks that you're going to get in Max 2, you've got me burping.
2233408	2234249	That's the first unlock.
2234289	2239175	No, the next unlock is all of the remixes.
2239215	2240877	Actually, I don't know what order these unlock in.
2240897	2242478	Sorry, I haven't gotten a list or anything.
2242959	2247664	But you get all the remixes, the Max 2 remixes that you can play in Extreme.
2249303	2271285	and then we know that you can unlock Crash or actually I think that's one of the songs you start off with is Crash and then Paranoia Survivor and there was one more Love Love Shine or Love Love Sugar one of those two Love Love Shine it's Love Love Shine you get you also unlock
2272316	2281299	Almost everything from Max USA that was exclusive, except the license tracks.
2281939	2287621	So you get Shining Polaris, Peace Out, Overblast, Logical Dash, Jammin' Marmalade, and I'm For Real.
2287641	2288221	You get all that.
2289341	2293323	And you also get Look to the Sky, True Color, Dynamite Rave, Downbird Soda.
2293343	2294183	You get all those songs.
2295103	2296043	We had them first.
2296263	2297504	Yeah, we had them first, so Nina.
2297764	2300985	And we still have... I like to move it.
2303932	2307876	Also, for whatever reason, they're bringing back Kind Lady and So In Love.
2307916	2313061	I mean, those songs are pretty cool and all, but it's kind of interesting because they were on the last mix.
2313822	2317085	Also, there's some brand spanking new stuff.
2318827	2320769	Do It Right, the 80s electro mix.
2323007	2324348	which is remixed by Soda.
2325049	2326390	And I hear it's pretty good.
2326450	2328872	We had some folks in the chatroom that have heard it, and it's pretty good.
2329592	2332495	As soon as we get MP3s, we'll play them for you guys.
2333415	2335097	Kind Lady, The Interlude.
2336418	2337179	Whatever that could mean.
2337799	2340141	I wonder if that's just that little groove beat at the beginning.
2342343	2342723	You know that?
2342743	2345265	It's kind of like... You sounded like a banjo.
2347407	2348408	Rob does bluegrass.
2350589	2351110	You know what?
2352011	2352511	What?
2354764	2356726	Yeah, I want to get an MP3, so I don't have to sing this.
2356766	2359129	I'm trying to find an MP3 so you can hear what I'm talking about here.
2359569	2360911	Okay, like this part.
2365956	2366897	Like the porno part.
2366937	2368078	We used that in a porn movie.
2368098	2368559	Yeah, we did.
2368639	2369460	I remember that.
2370721	2370881	Right.
2370901	2372563	Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.
2372603	2374144	Sure, yeah.
2374905	2376267	Also unlockable...
2377342	2383125	Look to the Sky, the Trance Mix, which is not Look to the Sky, the True Color Mix.
2383385	2386027	Now there's going to be three Look to the Skies all together.
2386047	2387187	Look to the Sky, Fart Mix.
2389569	2391390	Look to the Sky, because it stinks down below.
2395352	2398914	Yeah, how about, you know, like, look up to the skirt or something.
2398934	2399214	Yeah.
2400777	2406199	So you only get those three new songs, or pretty much the only super-duper new songs.
2407139	2410120	Also, they had to retool all of the Oni courses.
2411040	2411660	I said tool.
2412180	2418422	They had to retool all of the Oni courses, so you have the Oni courses more light, which is like some easy stuff, it's like the lesson Oni.
2419150	2423652	B4U, of course, because where would we be without a B4U-only course?
2424393	2431976	Nearly 130, however, since a minute it did not make it into Max 2 home version, they have Spin the Disc replacing a minute.
2433037	2433637	Spin the Dicks.
2434978	2439100	They have the From 2DX course, except now it has Gemma Marmalade and all these other songs.
2440684	2449888	The Love Song Collection, which is Baby Love Me, So In Love, Silent Hill, Dive Into The Night, which I never knew was a love song, and My Summer Love.
2451289	2454150	Now they have a DJ Soda Oni, which is pretty cool.
2455430	2460873	A middle tempo course, which is just kind of all like... Okay, I'm just noticing something.
2460893	2462373	It says DJ Soda Oni.
2462713	2463734	Why is Kind Lady in there?
2463754	2464814	I thought it was Okuyatos.
2465795	2468676	But Kind Lady Interlude, I believe, is remixed by Soda Oni.
2470085	2470585	Answer my question?
2471545	2471825	Alright.
2472446	2475746	And then you have the middle tempo chorus, which is kind of like a bunch of Dance Mania songs.
2476266	2478267	You have a chorus called Rap Mania.
2480587	2485248	And these are the songs that apparently are rap, according to Konami.
2486308	2496870	Long Train Runnin', Little Boy, Superstar, Hysteria, D2A, Burnin' the Floor, and Be For You.
2499071	2499251	Yes.
2501043	2506884	The Midnight Blue course is back, except they've replaced one song with another AM3P remix.
2507044	2512185	I don't know what song they took out, but... Do you remember the original Midnight Blue course?
2515906	2516926	Alright, whatever, fine.
2518427	2523108	Now they have a BPM 140 course, so now we have nearly 130 and nearly 140.
2525530	2535972	A tricky course, which I'm not sure yet, but rumor... Yeah, rumor is it's like the trick Oni in Extreme.
2536032	2537033	It's got changes in it.
2538133	2540633	A random Oni course, and this is the thing.
2540733	2543934	Not only is it random songs, but it's random modifiers.
2544954	2551396	We had a fellow in the chatroom, you know him if you listen to the show religiously, Jazz, was playing random...
2552496	2565888	And the random came up with Kind Lady, Reverse, nothing gonna stop, no mods, Silent Hill, Sudden, Mysterio 2001, Reverse, Boost, and then like Burning Heat, 2-speed, Boost, Reverse, and then Kind Lady, 3-speed, Boost.
2565908	2568551	So like it just fucks up all your modifiers.
2571698	2576263	There's a Naoki Platinum course, which actually, I believe, is the same course.
2576664	2579026	I think that's the one course that retained itself.
2579627	2580348	Wow, I'll be damned.
2581369	2586534	Um, some course in Japanese, that I'll... I don't know, I can't translate.
2586555	2588697	It has a star in it, so it's not really all Japanese.
2590199	2591280	Hmm, something woman?
2591820	2592862	Is it like the D.Va course?
2594542	2595003	It could be.
2595043	2597365	I think these are all... Yeah, these are all songs by women.
2597525	2598766	Yeah, what's up?
2598866	2599347	Copy that.
2599547	2601489	Oh, and put it into Globalgate?
2601689	2603871	Yeah, but I know one of them is from the film.
2604452	2605112	Well, let's see.
2605252	2607194	Let's translate that.
2614101	2615522	And the answer is... Unicron.
2616223	2617024	Maiden Way.
2618205	2618505	Yeah.
2618745	2619046	Yeah.
2619520	2620341	Then it's Girls' Course.
2620381	2624683	That might be just a normal, pure translation, but it might be something else.
2624743	2626184	I think it's like Girls' Course.
2628125	2629386	It's my Girls' Course!
2633368	2636050	Up and Down is another course.
2636170	2638351	I have no idea what these songs have in common.
2639652	2642414	And then there's the Shitty Demon Road.
2644249	2646711	What about the Ultra 64?
2646771	2647872	Not to my mommy.
2647892	2648972	Not to my mommy.
2676300	2678622	So you can order that now, DDR Max 2.
2678702	2682446	And also, if you ordered it from Konami Style already, you'll be getting a VRare CD.
2682746	2692016	And what's interesting is that those tracks on the VRare CD that we talked about, like Glacial, the I Feel remix, the Soda remix of I Feel and all that stuff, not in Max 2.
2692937	2693998	They're just there.
2694338	2697181	Yeah, they'll probably be in a future one.
2701610	2705333	So we shall see.
2706073	2711878	Oh yeah, if you haven't already heard yet, there's some other features in there, like you can create your own Oni course.
2720384	2723106	So, anything else you guys want to say about Max 2?
2724798	2729081	Nobody got it for me for my birthday, so I have to get it next month.
2729761	2731702	I have more money, but I didn't even buy it for myself.
2735104	2736305	I have something to say.
2736325	2737205	This DDR sucks.
2738526	2738886	Thank you.
2739226	2739767	That's very nice.
2740107	2740887	You're rapping cool.
2742528	2743209	Let's see, what else?
2746291	2749993	I'm looking at the official DDR Max 2 website.
2750526	2753728	I'm just trying to see if there's any, like, new information or anything cool.
2754588	2756049	Doesn't look like it.
2757690	2757930	What?
2758011	2758371	I'm what?
2761813	2762513	Fuck the chatroom.
2762573	2763334	No, I'm just kidding.
2765075	2766055	I love the chatroom.
2768437	2770318	He loves the chatroom for dinner.
2771379	2772479	Op, I have foods.
2772699	2773200	Chuck chuck.
2774941	2776882	Get you the hot bullets of shotgun to die.
2778379	2779760	Tell us about that story, Brad.
2779840	2780041	No.
2781081	2781982	Please, please.
2784044	2789649	I've been hearing from DarkSakura's SO that he's been saying this thing.
2789709	2792131	He goes, get you the hot shotgun bullets to die.
2792211	2799198	And it's kind of like in the vein of All Your Base, you know, bad English, some bad translation from an old Japanese game.
2799838	2802941	I found out on English.com, which I love.
2803301	2804482	Go check it out, English.com.
2804763	2804943	Great.
2805542	2806443	Makeup, you're on Ingrish!
2834613	2840036	We're going to translate Konami's Q&A on Max 2, and we're going to read it.
2841017	2843358	So it's like a radio drama, so this will be fun.
2843858	2848601	So this segment is called... Ingrish Like What?
2848801	2849722	Ingrish Like What?
2852223	2853264	Ingrish Like What?
2853624	2854625	Ingrish Like What?
2855005	2855985	Ingrish Like What?
2856205	2856526	Alright.
2859387	2861949	Alright, who wants to be question man and who wants to be answer man?
2865509	2867450	Alright Brad, are you Question Man or Answer Man?
2867590	2868490	I'll be Question Man.
2869170	2870870	Alright, Question Man, first question.
2870890	2872091	You sound like you're Mega Man.
2873231	2875031	Question Man, I will ask you questions.
2876832	2877932	Okay, so we have it in English?
2878652	2879133	Is this it?
2880393	2880693	Okay.
2881333	2884574	Can an exclusive controller be used even if set to PS2?
2884814	2885954	Please feel easy!
2886314	2891016	An exclusive controller and exclusive use hand controller also operate satisfactory.
2891716	2892376	Yay!
2895253	2898675	This is a question?
2898916	2899876	This is a question?
2908248	2914329	Dance Dance Revolution Series When linked with an arcade machine, output edit data by library manager.
2914669	2919850	Copy the edit data file which outputted to memory card for PlayStation by browser of PlayStation 2.
2920551	2925752	The edit data file copied to memory card for PlayStation can be used now by arcade machine, etc.
2926272	2936354	When the edit data of the past series is used, copy an edit data file to the memory card only for PlayStation 2 from memory card for PlayStation by the browser of PlayStation 2.
2937501	2942489	Load the memory card, only for PlayStation 2, which copy data and start edit mode.
2942589	2944132	Input data by outside manager.
2944212	2949059	The data inputted by the edit library can be edited in edit mode or can be used in game mode.
2949560	2950161	Game mode?
2950742	2950922	Ugh.
2952084	2952204	Ugh.
2952990	2954111	Very nice, very good.
2954431	2954732	Okay.
2955192	2959676	Isn't the function in which a screen position can be adjusted carried in Dan Dan's resolution?
2960096	2966041	The screen adjustment function of demand is added to option from the second edition DDR Max 2 of PS.
2966502	2968143	Please confirm by options.
2968423	2970365	Graphic, options, screen adjustment.
2971165	2971786	Oh my god.
2971986	2972387	You know what?
2972867	2973127	Okay.
2974829	2976290	And that was Max 2 English.
2978124	2983208	Max to English, Max to English, Max to English I think it was English like what originally?
2983228	2983608	Whatever.
2984008	2984749	Oh yeah, sorry.
2986510	2987671	English like what?
2987731	2988612	English like what?
2989552	2989792	Okay.
2990653	2999659	You know what's funnier, because I've done this before, is going to the Konami site, the 2DX site, where they have interviews with some of the artists for the new songs on each version.
3000900	3002942	Translate that shit, it's really fucking awful.
3004338	3010164	And by the way, the site used for the translations is nifty.com slash victory Hey, I have Samurai Shodown on Neo Geo And it does say victory
3027188	3027909	You know what's funny?
3027989	3036714	If you have any of the Japanese games, like I have the Japanese Samurai Spirits 2, which is Samurai Shodown, it'll play it in American mode and turn all the blood into sweat.
3037975	3041957	So like these big geysers of white fluid come shooting out of their bodies.
3044999	3046360	Unbelievably powerful.
3046721	3050383	You are now finally the strongest pro team except your challenge.
3052253	3054478	My spirit burns like the sun and I shall dry you like a prune
3066366	3069688	You want to know what's... Alright, next show that we do, I'll tell you what.
3070128	3072669	I will bring the manual for Samurai Shodown.
3072949	3074450	It is the funniest thing ever.
3074930	3077051	Because, like, it's completely English the whole time.
3077091	3084234	It talks about Amakusa, who is the bad guy, saying, Amakusa's quest is for world domination and a truly tasty cup of coffee.
3086455	3087175	I kid you not.
3088156	3089917	Here's the ending to Ghosts and Goblins.
3090957	3095219	Being the wise and courage adore... Adore!
3096145	3105753	Night that you are, you feel strong swelling in your body Return to starting point, challenge again Are you full of strong?
3108575	3115581	I feel this strong swelling inside my body Maybe I shouldn't have told you guys that I think you need to see a doctor for that condition
3116172	3117073	Air Fortress Spacey Music
3137282	3142227	On the planet Farmel, they had the glorious days for two centuries.
3142708	3150296	Since the star date had established, they sailed all around the galaxy with new type spaceship called Lightship.
3151057	3154941	But one day the peace was disturbed by a mysterious big fortress.
3155461	3158585	It was living and was destroying all other civilizations.
3159292	3170236	The Federal Bureau of Galactic Government organized the Defense Force immediately, but as the Air Fortress had very high potential, the Defense Sea Force was wiped out in vain.
3171416	3182440	So the Federal Bureau has decided to select a specially trained man, ID-2592 named Hal Bailman, and has developed new type lightbrancer and armored suit.
3183100	3187242	Now he departs for the Air Fortress with the destiny of Farmel.
3189622	3191622	Farmel, it sounds like Propel the sequel.
3193383	3195583	Formaldehyde flavored Propel?
3195943	3196363	Oh my.
3196963	3201884	Um, it's... Is it like a farming planet?
3201904	3202824	I don't know.
3202944	3203305	Whatever.
3204265	3207705	Man, they need to learn how to translate shit back into English.
3208786	3210166	It's like a shitty planet.
3211046	3213086	Congratulations, the story is happy end.
3213126	3213486	Thank you.
3215627	3216407	That's my favorite.
3217774	3220436	There's lots of other neat stuff on English.com, though.
3220677	3223639	English.com is highly recommended by the staff of Orange Launch Radio.
3225661	3226762	Hold on.
3226902	3228083	I have to read this one for you.
3228203	3228523	Okay.
3231566	3233107	It's like, I'm cock.
3234048	3236250	Or, what kind of world is this?
3236810	3237771	It's kind of crap.
3238111	3245017	Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
3246673	3248634	His name is Raman Saurus.
3248854	3255775	He is urchin, has many... He is urchin, has many curiosity, but he is a person who makes much good looks.
3257156	3259736	Yeah, Raman Sauruses have an image to uphold.
3261497	3266378	There's a... Somebody?
3267038	3267198	What?
3267238	3268079	What are you looking for?
3269799	3272760	I think that I like the one that has World of Pain on it.
3274324	3275405	and then no smorking.
3275945	3276666	Thank you, man.
3278927	3280869	This is really, really brilliant radio.
3281229	3281549	Okay.
3283170	3288354	Okay, this is something that was posted on an evacuation map in a hotel in China.
3288914	3291156	Please keep calm when there is a fire.
3291536	3295819	The hotel will ensure your safety in shit with advanced fire facilities.
3296579	3300942	Please go to the exit according to the instructions so that our staff will lead you to safe zone.
3301463	3303204	Point profess your excellency.

3320999	3322500	Oh, the Every Day I Hate My Life.
3322760	3323700	I hate my life.
3323961	3327502	Every day I polish my revolver and I shoot my head like a rock star.
3327863	3328743	I'm cock, what?
3328923	3330004	I'm trying to read this chick's shirt.
3330024	3330464	It says, I'm cock.
3330564	3331905	I'm home, I'm all alone.
3332165	3334346	I need some her coffee.
3334366	3334986	Hot coffee.
3337187	3342030	There were three jovial Welshmen as I have some things.
3343177	3345399	and they would go hunting upon St.
3345459	3362157	David's said it was a ship that either he said the chimney blown away or whatever I want the one that says spread beaver showing the vaginal area it says showing the vaginal area
3364553	3364973	That's it.
3369194	3370214	Link that one in the chatroom.
3374575	3375276	I want that shirt.
3375696	3376516	I would wear that shirt.
3380397	3385538	Spread Beaver was actually the name of a band in Japan fronted by the ex-Japan guitarist Hide.
3386624	3387665	Yeah, but he's dead now.
3388466	3388807	Is he?
3388887	3389448	Yeah.
3390128	3393513	He hung himself in the door.
3393733	3405287	Everybody said he hung himself, but what I heard is that he, uh, what he actually did was, um, when he practiced his guitar sometimes, he would tie, like, a belt or something around his neck and then tie it to the back of a, um...
3405788	3406948	I have my hideplushie hanging from a doorknob.
3430898	3432038	I bought a hide plushie.
3433299	3435600	He has this string on his head so you can hang him up.
3435920	3437802	So I was hanging it from the doorknob by my finger.
3437822	3444105	Yeah, because apparently it was tied to the doorknob and that's when they found him or something.
3444766	3446527	That's really disgusting, but it's so funny.
3448328	3450829	I'm just, you know, being true to the original.
3452510	3452990	Oh, man.
3453791	3458533	Yeah, my JFK plushie has two bullet holes in its head and shoulder.
3458553	3459054	It's crazy.
3462253	3464454	Hey, let's listen to music.
3464854	3465914	Yes, let's listen to music.
3465934	3466695	We're going to take a quick break.
3466715	3471456	We're going to come back and do that one segment we can't get through a show without doing.
3472916	3473636	Fak you, man.
3474477	3477917	It's Jamie's Fak You of the Week and my Fak You of the Week.
3477958	3479698	I know I didn't pick a cake much this morning.
3480239	3481660	It's okay, we're not doing a cage match tonight.
3481860	3483060	Fuck it, I say he's not here.
3483080	3483681	Let's do one.
3483941	3485501	You want to do a cage match without Loki?
3485521	3486262	I'll fix it.
3486282	3490444	There's hardly... You know what the thing is, though, since we didn't really announce this, because we wanted this to be a treat.
3490484	3494826	For those of you that listen to Orange Homs Radio a lot, we wanted this sneak... A treat, the alternative to spam.
3495046	3504570	This sneak... Yeah, we wanted this sneak preview of what is sure to be a very... Turn off all pagers and cell phones.
3504590	3504930	Thank you.
3505050	3505850	Hope you have a nice play again.
3505871	3506271	Dot com.
3507350	3511932	We wanted this to be a special treat for those of you who listen to Orange Limes a lot to get to hear this show like before everyone else.
3512772	3513713	And aren't you happy?
3515394	3518395	Yeah, so we don't have a lot of people available to vote, but we can do one anyway.
3520016	3520216	Yes?
3520776	3533401	I think that we should do... What is this?

3583393	3586074	Because I'm entertaining
3589169	3590909	It was either that or this one.
3600073	3603215	I haven't played that in forever.
3603595	3604335	Anyway... No.
3607601	3608682	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

3661011	3662371	And you'll get a FAQ right back.
3662551	3662951	We'll be back.
3668342	3671006	That's right, Joey Swift joined one.
3671046	3674651	Before there were words, communication was done through teeth.
3674671	3676574	Body language is controlled by rhythm.
3676614	3678456	Music is the universal link.
3678577	3679678	Feel this, feel these.
3679718	3679959	Huh, huh.
3720710	3723653	Tell me your name and I'll say it Where's the hell?
3723773	3726476	I'll blow it Last time I died, that's real Where's the hell?

4027991	4030834	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network
4051038	4054861	Monkey Magic Monkey Magic Monkey Magic Monkey Magic
4110537	4112298	Bitch, get a new song.
4112939	4115440	An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.
4115900	4117642	Funny enough, she never did find a new song.
4117942	4119603	We haven't heard from Joga in a long, long time.
4119643	4119803	Good.
4121238	4122319	You know what's interesting?
4122359	4123079	I don't... I don't... Okay.
4139040	4143285	We've talked about her on the show before, this Japanese rocker girl chick who's awesome.
4143305	4143945	Her name's Kana.
4144646	4148310	She would play Miku if you have it.
4148350	4149171	I think I might.
4149211	4149992	I think you've sent it to me.
4150072	4152134	Anyway, I have a point to this.
4153315	4160263	Our new friend Garrett, who we discovered randomly on a 2DX machine four weeks ago, and we just kind of picked him up and made him come home with us and play with us.
4161103	4163725	Not like that, you perverts.
4163785	4170188	I was showing him Kana videos the other night, and he was just laughing his ass off going, this is great, she's kind of like the Japanese Bjork.
4171369	4173530	And I had a point to this story, but I don't remember what it was.
4176324	4177666	I have a question.
4177706	4180208	Was she from a band originally?
4180228	4181870	I don't think so.
4181990	4184773	Okay, I guess she was from some other band.
4184853	4188256	She does the elegant... Gothic Lolita stuff?
4188276	4188416	Yeah.
4188436	4188616	Yeah.
4199206	4202189	I like when she's got a little panda thing.
4202289	4203750	And she does panda bondage.
4203770	4207774	Yeah, she does a lot of panda bondage, which is really weird, because they don't rate pandas, do you?
4208014	4210837	Poor pandas, they're like, you know... They don't even rate the pandas.
4210857	4213219	They're just wrapped in ribbons and bondaged it.
4213239	4216321	I was going to say, the WWF... Ribbon!
4217796	4218236	Rick, what?
4218356	4218736	Ribbon.
4218957	4219317	Ribbon?
4220397	4220817	Sorted!
4222038	4222558	Arrowed.
4223478	4224139	Ordinate.
4224699	4224959	What?
4225539	4225839	What?
4226500	4227040	Oh my.
4227320	4230461	Jamie's lost her... Jamie's lost her mind.
4231082	4232182	Whatever.
4232742	4232982	Yes.
4233523	4236324	But for some reason I thought she was from, like, Malice Miser, but that's Gak, I think.
4237416	4237877	Oh, this is bad.
4237937	4238397	Oh, this is bad.
4238497	4239137	Here is justice.
4265794	4270756	Here is my butt.
4271516	4276798	Um, my typhus relief goes to my back for fucking hurting.
4276818	4277999	Fuck it.
4278859	4279680	It hurts a lot.
4279760	4282461	It's been hurting me for like two weeks now and I've been thinking about getting it for it.
4283641	4285582	And I have, um, there's a
4286354	4287895	Other crap now that I'm going to take.
4288235	4291977	And I have this heat pad attached to my butt.
4292117	4293438	It's sort of like in my pants.
4294459	4297100	It's those ones that you wrap around your stomach.
4297881	4299742	Except I couldn't get it to sit low enough.
4300062	4305625	So I just tore the velcro parts off and stuck it in my pants.
4306105	4307246	So now it's warm.
4307686	4309007	My back is warm.
4309287	4310528	My lower back is warm.
4310908	4312749	But still, it hurts like fuck.
4313930	4314590	It hurts like...
4316388	4317129	Fondage Pops.
4318389	4319310	It hurts.
4319850	4322132	I don't know.
4322252	4325354	My other fucky again goes to Squeenix for sucking.
4328620	4356392	and another one goes toward having no money so I can't have my games right now and a happy fuck you goes to the ending of Final Fantasy X-2 which I'm not going to spoil for anybody but I like it but there needs to be more and also a fuck you again goes toward Final Fantasy X-2 for having a freaking confusing ass storyline so I guess I'm not going to get it until I actually play through the game
4357632	4363574	and, um, another one goes toward not really having any more and not getting that one.
4363594	4366935	Yeah, because I've had salad today and that's it.
4367455	4371036	Oh yeah, another funky goes toward not being able to digest anything.
4372556	4373456	That was beautiful, thank you.
4373476	4379338	Um, I have some FUs this week.
4379618	4383399	My biggest FU this week goes to procrastination.
4385160	4386621	You guys have seen the house, right?
4386741	4388142	And what's happening on Saturday?
4388823	4389363	I'm moving.
4389443	4389984	You're moving.
4390204	4392246	How many boxes have you seen that have been packed?
4393386	4393647	None.
4393827	4395068	There's one in the living room.
4395208	4395908	Oh, I didn't see.
4397249	4398250	Oh, uh-oh.
4398490	4399351	What have you got there, Rob?
4399371	4404195	So, I was given an interesting strategy on how to pack my shit because... Oh, that sounds dirty.
4404815	4411420	I was given an interesting strategy on how to pack stuff up... Wait, hold on.
4411560	4411981	Hold on.
4412081	4412781	Stop the presses.
4412821	4413542	Stop the presses.
4414042	4414763	Jamie has a joke.
4419730	4426212	If California were going to fall off into the ocean and everyone had to evacuate to an island, who do you think would be out first, the lesbians or the gay men?
4428752	4430212	Uh, the gay men.
4431033	4434733	Wrong, because the gay men would still be packing their shit while the lesbians are out looking to be split.
4436374	4441275	That was a good joke.
4441295	4443375	My next FU of the week goes to bad jokes.
4446748	4448553	Heard it in the taxi cab in Vegas.
4450279	4451122	Were you drunk?
4451162	4452305	God bless Vegas.
4453706	4454747	I think I might have been.
4455287	4464153	Yes, I was, because it was with me and Iguana Girl and Islander coming back from Circus Circus being drunk off Warp Core Breaches.
4465333	4466594	Playing drunk DVRs.
4468055	4471857	Well, anyway, I procrastinated and I haven't packed a damn thing yet and I'm moving on Saturday.
4472438	4474919	Actually, no, if you go out in my garage, I have a lot of shit in boxes.
4474959	4475820	I really do, but you know why?
4475840	4477581	Because I never unpacked last time.
4477881	4478761	That sounds like my house.
4478801	4479702	You saw my closet.
4479782	4480482	Yeah, yeah.
4481103	4482723	So, moving isn't going to be so bad.
4482743	4485245	I just have to pack this up, my bed up, my clothes.
4485265	4486885	All my clothes are going to be the hardest one, but that'll be easy.
4487626	4491628	Anywho, I had an interesting strategy sent to me on how to pack my stuff.
4492088	4494069	And this was sent to me by Garrett, same guy we were talking about earlier.
4494309	4503854	Get some big boxes and do something like label my boxes, upper right part of closet, lower left part of closet, shit on the floor in living room, and then fill them up accordingly.
4503874	4504894	That's how I pack.
4507506	4509367	I have another question.
4510527	4511887	I think I got bit by a spider.
4513548	4514348	On your cleavage.
4515948	4517729	Or your, if you're, you know, French.
4519029	4519769	Cleavage.
4520049	4522190	I think I got bit by a spider, so fuck that spider!
4522530	4526671	Jamie's gonna go get her cleavage wet.
4526731	4527431	Cleavage.
4530192	4532112	In the meantime, do I have any FUs left?
4533133	4533293	No.
4533953	4534393	Brad's turn.
4538499	4539600	How do you always give me this?
4540141	4542164	Because it's cute.
4542184	4543445	That's fuck you music.
4543505	4543866	Okay.
4546509	4551195	I had a fuck you, but my mind is rumbling because I just got a phone call.
4551215	4551555	Anyway.
4553938	4554959	What were we just talking about?
4555320	4555540	Okay.
4556977	4560078	Oh, yes, we were talking about Jamie's Breastises.
4560318	4578704	Okay, no, fuck you goes to people, and no offense, Jamie, but fuck you goes to people who spoil games for themselves, and waiting... No, for themselves, I mean, like, instead of waiting till the game comes out, they, like, read about the story, and Jamie's like, I'm getting the game anyway.
4579024	4580325	I'm poor, I can't have the game.
4581025	4582065	I don't have an architecture.
4582085	4582145	Um...
4584420	4587363	And I had something else, but I don't remember, so I want to eat.
4587383	4587843	I'm hungry.
4587963	4589585	Okay.
4590065	4591967	Say we fuck the show.
4594049	4596091	If we can make it through another half hour, I know we can.
4596672	4597552	And we can get to two hours.
4597592	4603258	Actually, we do have a present for the last hour of the show, so we'll get to that later.
4604099	4604459	A gift.
4604479	4605400	We're making a gift.
4605600	4607282	We've made a gift.
4607362	4608503	Actually, Jamie made a gift.
4608991	4609792	Fag Hags Community
4638467	4641070	I'm looking because Puppy sent me an interesting FU.
4641090	4642311	It involves a web link.
4643192	4644553	And he might have already deleted it.
4645394	4649899	He wants to give a big FU to somebody that posted something naughty in his girlfriend's journal.
4650019	4650780	I'm loading that up.
4650820	4651881	We'll come back to his FU.
4652342	4653423	Let's go to Zero's FUs.
4654988	4656869	F you to not being able to be there tonight.
4657109	4657849	Yeah, we're at zero.
4657989	4658489	We miss you.
4659350	4662531	F you to my legs giving out in the middle of Legend of Max all three times.
4662751	4666152	F you to my ass hurting as I fall to the ground on Legend of Max.
4666852	4670234	F you to stupid assholes who think because they live in my house they can fuck shit up.
4670674	4672675	DarkSakura, I think we can use those boxes.
4674195	4676196	Stop trying to get people to buy your fucking alcohol.
4676216	4677736	I think I will turn your stupid ass in.
4678117	4681918	DarkChild says, fuck you to the stupid 17-year-old girl who keeps calling me.
4683027	4685468	Although it would have been smarter to have given her the wrong phone number.
4686048	4686868	Hey, you know what?
4687468	4688389	I want to talk to her.
4688909	4691230	Let me talk to her.
4691590	4693370	Better yet, let's talk to her live on air.
4693971	4694571	Get her number.
4694611	4695411	I'll call her.
4696291	4697912	We'll find a way to tape the conversation.
4700533	4704454	Dark Tetsuya would like to say, Fuck not knowing what to do with crushes indeed.
4704534	4707195	And for Angel, fuck having to work and missing the surprise.
4710757	4712458	I know what you mean a little bit, actually.
4713078	4718280	I actually know what you mean very well.
4718700	4720361	John Fields would like to say, Hey!
4720381	4720661	Hey!
4720701	4721521	The wizard rules!
4721541	4721741	Hold on.
4735836	4740779	The Wizard, all those games, or movies, Double Dragon, you know, all sucked ass.
4741759	4743560	Actually, I haven't seen The Wizard, so I guess I shouldn't judge it.
4743980	4746482	But Resident Evil was probably the best.
4747344	4749745	Video game to movie production ever.
4750346	4765554	And if they're going to start doing, because movie producers and directors are starting to notice this kind of stuff is becoming popular, like the comic book movies, the big budget comic book movies that are coming out, I think they're going to do pretty good with the Metroid movie.
4765634	4767055	I'm hoping.
4767916	4771418	Oh man, it would suck if Drew Barrymore was Samus or something.
4771478	4772018	Oh my god.
4773279	4773639	There you go.
4777225	4781707	I was looking for my Power Glove, it's so bad quote, but I lost it, I'm so mad.
4783068	4783669	Oh well, anyway.
4784649	4784989	Wait, what?
4788671	4789392	Oh, okay.
4790712	4794835	For now, I have to change their song, hold on, Jamie's requesting I change the FU song for the chatroom.
4795235	4804280	Load, load, load, load, load, load.
4808126	4808847	Oh, this is happy.
4808887	4809507	I like this one.
4814151	4815292	Oh, this is good FU music.
4815312	4815733	I like this.
4817154	4818054	Alright, let's move on.
4818195	4821898	The 23rd Magus would like to say, FU to my screwy school schedule next week.
4822418	4828724	Everyone else has to take their stupid little tests, which leaves me in government class for five hours with no bathroom passes.
4829064	4829624	What the fuck?
4830305	4831946	FU to Angel's screwy work schedule.
4832407	4832667	Fet.
4833866	4839791	FU to having random DDRs at school begging me to take them to an Orange Lawns broadcast, which I will do, so fear.
4840491	4841512	Uh, sure you will.
4842213	4842393	Out.
4844114	4846656	Brack2000 would like to say FU to sore throats.
4846836	4849078	Everything tastes like, um, sore throats.
4851540	4853281	Chloroseptic is your friend.
4858665	4863309	Okay, I'm going back to puppies FU, but the damn page isn't loading because LiveJournal's being a biznatch.
4877985	4879946	God, it's the stupid tub girl thing.
4880046	4881447	God damn it, why'd you have to show that?
4881807	4883087	I didn't even let the whole thing load.
4883227	4888630	Like 20 pixels of it came up, I recognized it as being disgusting, and I flipped it off.
4890830	4891651	Stupid kids!
4891751	4893451	How can people pee me that color?
4894612	4896152	She must have been eating something.
4896433	4897633	Easy, it's Photoshop.
4900074	4901234	Goatse was funny.
4901795	4904416	That's the color of the Walmart that's on the corner of Arden and...
4905734	4907215	Not Walmart, Walgreens.
4907756	4908857	It's by the mall.
4909317	4911038	Let me think of when Goat Say was funny.
4911098	4912720	I think it was about five minutes.
4912800	4913100	Never.
4920986	4921867	Shame on you, puppy.
4921947	4922548	Bad puppy.
4924029	4925750	That's me beating puppy with a newspaper.
4926951	4927952	Bad puppy.
4929493	4931275	It was just that fucking tub girl.
4933636	4934037	Gross.
4935200	4936701	Rose, yeah, now I'm not hungry.
4936781	4937242	Thank you.
4937542	4938322	Hey, you know what?
4938923	4939703	Fuck you, man.
4942005	4943186	Back you to Black Lab.
4946888	4947389	Just kidding.
4947749	4948490	We love Black Lab.
4949150	4949570	For dinner.
4951932	4952973	Mmm, fried puppy.
4955454	4958817	I think at that Genghis Kong Mongolian barbecue I had some puppies there.
4959577	4960438	You're mean.
4962900	4964481	Puppy says it was more than that.
4966073	4966853	Um, fuck you.
4967854	4968174	Don't.
4968194	4969194	Fuck you goes to my pants.
4969274	4971014	Oh, it's a 20-picture montage.
4972795	4973215	God.
4973755	4974635	Alright, look away.
4974715	4975376	Here's your chance.
4977356	4979577	Of course, that means, like, everybody's watching now.
4982958	4983958	Who the hell did it?
4985198	4985939	Oh, it's gone.
4986279	4987079	Puppy deleted it.
4988079	4989520	Who the fuck did that anyway?
4989980	4991040	No, let me know who did it.
4992380	4993381	Save their ID.
4993421	4994281	It was anonymous.
4995524	4996605	You can IP track them.
4997005	4998145	Yeah, you should log IPs.
4999026	4999786	That's how I track them.
4999806	5001807	If you want to plot some revenge, get with Jamie.
5002708	5003208	I've done it.
5003468	5004109	I have done it.
5004369	5010072	And there are ways you can trace somebody down to their zip code to find out where they live by their IP address.
5010752	5011613	Jamie's a geek.
5014214	5014614	In a good way.
5015835	5022358	That's how I knew who it was, that it wasn't, you know, who spammed my live journal.
5022438	5023299	It was his friend that did it.
5023579	5023779	Oh, okay.
5026067	5030815	It was anonymous and their IP tracking wasn't turned on.
5031256	5032598	So now's a good time to turn that on.
5032638	5035123	Turn on the IP tracking and disallow anonymous posting.
5038769	5040590	Anyway, let's take a break.
5040810	5041330	Another break.
5041430	5048152	And we'll be back and we'll wrap up kind of like this segment of the show and then we're going to move into another segment of the show.
5048652	5049552	It's going to be interesting.
5049592	5050973	We're experimental tonight.
5051313	5053914	We aren't live, but you should still come into the chat room.
5054014	5054614	We're live right now.
5054714	5055614	Well, we're live on Thursday.
5055634	5056775	Yeah, right now we're live.
5056835	5057875	If it's Thursday, we're live.
5057915	5058675	If it's Sunday, we're not.
5058895	5060836	Actually, no, because we rebroadcast.
5060896	5062256	The Thursday rebroadcast usually.
5062336	5063036	Anyway, fuck it.
5063076	5063277	Whatever.
5063297	5064817	Fuck it.
5064857	5065917	Either we're live or we're not.
5065957	5067498	Just go to the chat room and they'll tell you.
5068462	5096628	Go to KaliBumani.com Click on Orange Lounge Click on chat While I choke on something And in the meantime, let's play Let's play Usaukun Let's play it the whole way through And we'll play some other stuff from Keyboard Mania Because Keyboard Mania is happy, fun, joy dance Usaukun Usaukun

5373408	5373928	Testing.
5374928	5375808	Testing, one, two.
5376369	5380130	I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.
5380230	5380710	Hello?
5381370	5382831	I don't understand this.
5383331	5384211	Does this thing work?
5384231	5385812	This thing reads like stereo instructions.
5385832	5386472	Is this on?
5386492	5387052	What the hell?
5389628	5394552	Orange Lounge Radio, Broke Down Ghetto Bomani Radio What the f***?
5395472	5398294	And no better example of that than tonight, episode number 42.
5398434	5401877	Do you get points if you can tell us where the beep came from?
5403858	5405179	They know, that's so easy.
5405679	5407521	I know one person that's going to get that in two seconds.
5408141	5414045	Yeah, tell us the answer and then we can tease you because you're a dork.
5414426	5416187	Yeah, that's what you win.
5417242	5418862	You're so stupid!
5418942	5422463	I didn't hear it, but I'm going to guess it's the Healing Vision Angelic Wings.
5422643	5423363	Wrong!
5423463	5423943	Wrong!
5423983	5425283	You're so stupid!
5425864	5426904	Stupid American!
5427564	5428524	It's easy, come on.
5432125	5435925	Orange Lounge Radio, Broke Down Ghetto Bomani Radio.
5436025	5436666	What the f***?
5440106	5440746	You couldn't hear it.
5440906	5444547	It's just a beat, why don't you just forget what you're doing?
5446152	5450917	Oh, you want to know what the... Oh, I thought the... Oh, I thought you were talking about the backbeat.
5450937	5452719	The QQQ music I thought you were talking about.
5453519	5454000	Oh, the beep.
5454040	5454721	Yeah, oh, the beep.
5455501	5455962	One more time.
5456002	5456502	What the f***?
5456522	5457203	Oh, he just got it.
5473605	5475048	I'm spinning uncontrollably.
5476090	5477192	I feel like Dr. Evil.
5477934	5478835	Alright.
5479797	5480880	What else do I want to talk about?
5481200	5481721	Oh yeah, I know.
5482904	5483604	We're going to do a cage match.
5483624	5485225	We're going to do a cage match?
5485305	5487466	Yeah, remember I said we've got to have a new computer.
5487586	5488106	Oh, well shit.
5488126	5489106	Okay, so we're going to do a cage match.
5489367	5492608	Loki agreed his song sucked, so we're throwing it out and we're starting new.
5492708	5493988	So we have a new cage match.
5494569	5497830	And in this week's cage match, I have to dig a little bit for Jamie's song.
5497850	5499391	And I haven't even picked one yet.
5499431	5501231	Do you remember what week we did it?
5501271	5502672	Don't you usually copy them to your hard drive?
5502992	5504232	Not anymore because that hard drive is full.
5504533	5507934	Let's just keep that one in there.
5510942	5511823	Talk about something.
5511883	5513264	Talk about sex or something.
5514705	5517106	I like bananas.
5517767	5524151	There was actually something about this one research group saying that bananas, as we know them, are going to be extinct in a few years.
5524631	5525032	Why?
5525052	5527293	Because we bleed them out.
5527613	5528034	Why?
5528054	5532437	Because they stick them up their vaginas.
5533197	5533577	Why?
5533597	5535178	It would be really interesting to throw them in.
5536379	5536739	Why?
5536759	5537980	Then they stick them up their ass.
5538541	5538961	Why?
5538981	5539041	Why?
5540546	5541707	I don't know, Rob, you tell us.
5542247	5542707	Why?
5544008	5545909	Say something.
5546769	5549350	Something.
5549370	5549430	Rap?
5549891	5550051	Okay.
5552732	5555914	I am here, and my name is Chaos.
5556034	5561156	Okay, I found Jamie's... I found the song that Jamie was trying to do, so let's get this show on the road.
5561176	5565819	This is Cage Match without Loki, version 2.5.
5567239	5568380	Tonight's Cage Match.
5569907	5576251	Last week in the cage match, the duck song won again, but fuck it, because Loki wants to pull it because it sucks.
5576932	5579634	So instead, we have new contenders tonight.
5580214	5584837	The first one being a song called... Well, Jamie, you ought to introduce this.
5584857	5586399	Born to Bone, the Sandbone Trio.
5586879	5587599	And what's it from?
5588020	5588920	From Guitar Man.
5589441	5590221	And why do you like it?
5590241	5591682	Because it's fucking rules.
5591942	5594504	Alright, here it is, first entry tonight, so we're going to do it on the cage match.
5594564	5595425	Born to be Bone.
5616126	5616830	Thanks for watching!
5818601	5820002	Yay, it's mariachi-rific.
5820402	5822342	I was born to be bone, the Sandbone Trio.
5823063	5824943	First song in tonight's Orange Lounge Cage Match.
5825784	5827024	What did you think of that one, Jamie?
5827184	5827504	Nine.
5828445	5828805	Why?
5829605	5831146	Because it's cool.
5833426	5837468	That's probably my favorite song on that whole soundtrack, so I'm going to give it a nine.
5839310	5844554	I like that song, but I think if it wins too many weeks in a row, I'm going to get sick of it really fast.
5844694	5847876	So, I'll give it a good score this week, but next week it gets a crappy score.
5848717	5849918	So this week it gets 8.5.
5849958	5853420	Ah, son of a bitch.
5854962	5855402	Uh-oh.
5855422	5858464	Oh, sorry, I just put in a CD that went to an extended CD.
5858484	5860646	And it's not going to let you read the track data either.
5861387	5862668	Oh shit, it won't, huh?
5862868	5863108	Nope.
5867521	5868561	Ah, son of a bitch.
5869682	5870362	Wait, I know another way.
5870382	5871362	I know a way around it, I think.
5873603	5877404	I'm trying to pick my cage match song, and we're kind of doing this live on air.
5877485	5878345	I kind of ran out.
5878365	5880986	I just changed my mind at the last minute about what I wanted to play.
5881446	5882866	So I ran out to get it.
5884187	5886688	I want to see if I can get this to go.
5889709	5889789	Okay.
5889809	5890089	Okay.
5891584	5894608	Give me just one second, and I'm going to get my... One!
5895249	5896130	One second!
5896351	5896911	Okay, here we go.
5898641	5901202	I think I got it, so I'm gonna make sure this broadcasts.
5901242	5901962	Okay, my pick.
5902483	5912426	She got my FU of the week last week, but this week I'm putting her in the cage match because, well, I don't think any song I put in stands a chance against Sandbone Trio, so why not lose big?
5912686	5926372	I'm gonna put in Madonna, and this is a brand new track from her new album, and it's not American Life, the lead single, because you guys are probably worn out on that by now, but it's another track, and to me, the track is actually a bit Beatmania-ish to me, which is kind of why I like it.
5926912	5926992	Um...
5927612	5941045	and because it kind of progresses and it's a little silly the lyrics are kind of silly but it's an interesting song I think you guys might like it it's called Mother and Father and this is going to be my cage match pick for tonight and hopefully it plays for you guys otherwise I'm going to have to change it so let's try it
5961880	5979205	There was a time I was happy in my life There was a time I believed I'd live forever There was a time that I prayed to Jesus Christ There was a time I had a mother, it was nice
6001701	6016627	I'm trying hard to dry my tears Yes, father, you know I'm not so free I got to give it up Find someone to love me I got to let it go
6034418	6056034	I got to give it up, find someone to rely on me I got to let it go, find someone that I can care for There was a time I was happy in my life
6056812	6057913	DarkSakura.com
6103411	6104759	Thank you for watching!
6133956	6154534	I would never meet another person, never turn my heart into a cage, a victim of a kind of rage I got to give it up, I got to give it up Find someone to light me up Find someone that I can care for I got to give it up, find someone
6167474	6168810	Thank you for watching!
6216431	6216871	That's it.
6217171	6218793	That's Mother and Father by Madonna.
6222195	6228939	So, let's get... The end sounds like you ate a burrito and farted.
6229139	6232681	Let's get reaction from the room on Mother and Father by Madonna.
6232701	6234222	She's done much better.
6234843	6236924	I give it a 7, maybe.
6238925	6239446	Brad?
6239686	6243168	Since I haven't heard really anything besides the single from the CD...
6246696	6265392	I like the single better than this, I guess I shouldn't compare it By itself, it's pretty good, but it's, yeah, she has it better, so I'd give it like a 5 or 6, probably 6 I like it, the reason why I picked this song, you know what, the more, now that I'm listening to it in the context of this program That really was a shitty Cage Max pick
6266357	6268639	Because it doesn't stand very well on its own.
6268739	6270981	It really goes with the rest of the album.
6271382	6275485	But I like that song in relation to the rest of it because it's very quirky.
6276186	6278147	It's got... I don't know.
6278167	6280690	It just sounds very old school Madonna to me.
6280710	6281110	I don't know.
6281130	6284993	If you let me pick my song, it's going to be way quirkier.
6286395	6286755	I don't know.
6286775	6287476	What do you think, Jamie?
6287516	6288637	Should we let Brad put a song in?
6289177	6290178	Or we just want to keep it at two?
6290899	6291739	What's the song, Brad?
6291759	6293401	Twelve.
6294993	6295873	Alright, fine.
6298034	6304615	Since nobody's going to vote for that one, I guess we have to give Sandbone Trio a little competition.
6306336	6306756	Let's see.
6308176	6310817	Oh, Jesus.
6310937	6313017	Alright, what's the song that you're putting in?
6313057	6313857	Is this an audio CD?
6314078	6316078	Yeah, it's audio, so pull up the trackers.
6316138	6317198	I need to see the trackers first.
6317278	6317458	Okay.
6329108	6329568	We're rolling...
6356943	6358028	This is the good one.
6358229	6359013	Take five.
6382403	6383184	DarkSakura.com
6437677	6439860	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
6472660	6473441	Thank you for watching!
6531616	6535563	I'm a chicken machine I'm a chicken machine
6560823	6563386	That was the Aquabats with Magic Chicken.
6563406	6565628	Jamie, what did you think of that?
6565708	6566229	I like Skaf.
6585917	6588197	I don't think that that would work as a cage match song.
6588798	6590278	As a song, it gets a 9.
6590918	6592698	As a cage match pick, it gets a 4.
6592758	6594979	Brad!
6596199	6597019	I have to agree.
6597439	6599900	I wasn't trying to make it compete with anything.
6600500	6601500	I love the song.
6601520	6603380	As a song, it gets a 10.
6603580	6606261	As a cage match, it gets a crap.
6606921	6609461	So I wasn't trying, you know, that was just kind of a fucked up thing.
6609681	6612202	But before we go on to you, I want to ask something.
6612802	6613022	What...
6614034	6615155	is a Cage Match song.
6615235	6618737	Is Cage Match just Beat Mania style stuff?
6618918	6621139	Trance, techno, dancey stuff?
6621359	6624301	Songs that you'd want to hear regularly on Orange Moms Radio.
6624361	6627163	That's what Cage... Okay, see, I had it all wrong.
6628424	6632167	Next time I'll make sure to get something good that you want to hear, like Eminem or something.
6632647	6633688	Slick motherfuckers.
6634669	6636010	Sorry, I'm kidding.
6637371	6639032	As for my opinions on the song...
6640258	6641659	11.
6640538	6641659	Best cage match pick ever.
6644920	6649662	No, my favorite part of that song is when he's ratting off the different chicken places.
6649922	6650642	It's not bad.
6651903	6652703	You know what?
6652843	6653944	It's very Guitar Freaks.
6654004	6655044	I can see it in Guitar Freaks.
6655084	6656525	Totally.
6656545	6658326	Yeah, whatever.
6658666	6659026	Whatever.
6659166	6659486	Seven.
6659506	6659846	Whatever.
6660386	6661027	Okay, so.
6662047	6665829	Your entries, your possible votes, and send those votes to Sky in the chat room right now.
6665869	6668690	You can vote for the Sandbone Trio with Born to be Bone.
6670333	6672974	Which is off a CD that's not in it.
6673034	6674915	Okay, you don't get clips of the songs tonight.
6674955	6676695	If you don't remember them, you suck.
6677095	6683238	So you get Born to be Boned from the Sandbone Trio, The Aquabats with Magic Chicken, or Madonna with Mother and Father.
6684718	6685819	And not Duck Toy.
6686059	6686839	And not Duck Toy.
6686879	6688419	If you vote for Duck Toy, you get kicked.
6690831	6694773	So, send me your votes in the chatroom right now of a private message to Sky.
6695234	6697895	Unless it's Sunday, because we're pre-taped this week.
6698095	6702658	So, if you know the super secret time that we're taping, send them right now.
6704119	6709341	If you're in the chatroom right now, I actually want to hold off just really fast.
6709402	6713324	I want to get one more news story out in the open before we go to a break.
6713844	6714885	Rob has a confession.
6715305	6716445	I have a confession to make.
6716926	6716946	I...
6718249	6720010	Am Homo Sapien.
6720230	6720550	Okay.
6722291	6728673	I don't know if you guys have heard about this yet, but have you ever been to those sites, Petition Online, like where you can sign petitions?
6728773	6730153	And no one really gives a fuck about them?
6730334	6731274	No one really cares?
6731574	6735976	Like they had a petition to save Frenchie on American Idol that got like 500,000 signatures?
6736276	6736896	It didn't do shit.
6737552	6742354	Well, somebody decided, well, maybe we can get petitions to work for once.
6742374	6747755	We're going to petition for Konami of Japan to release a new version of Beatmania 2DX to the consumer.
6748056	6749736	However, there's a catch to this petition.
6751017	6751717	And I'll read this.
6752377	6758259	This is a petition asking Konami for a new release of Beatmania 2DX, preferably 7th style, for the Japanese PlayStation 2 console.
6758599	6764041	For all fans who are looking forward to a new mix, please sign this petition as it will be sent directly to Konami of Japan.
6764421	6766962	Either KCEJ or Konami Toyo.
6767870	6773512	This is not a solo project and is part of a larger petition with major Japanese Bimani fansite.
6774072	6779073	Any comments you add will be translated into Japanese and sent along with your name to Konami.
6779453	6780254	That's kind of the catch.
6781854	6783034	Thank you for supporting this petition.
6783855	6794097	So, if you want to go sign this petition, I'll post the link in the chat room right now, and hopefully somebody will be kind enough to repaste it at this point in the show on Sunday when it rebroadcasts.
6794458	6795718	But the website for this petition...
6797034	6805782	is petitiononline.com slash new2dx, but that's the number 2, not ii, as you usually see it.
6806102	6811387	So it's petitiononline.com slash new2dx.
6812608	6817091	So you can go sign that petition, and right now, there's quite a few.
6817131	6820034	We've got 98 signatures on it so far, so not too bad.
6820915	6822056	So you can go sign that right now.
6822116	6823497	Maybe you'll be lucky 100.
6823557	6824478	Quick, get in there right now.
6825234	6829197	Okay, so that's what you can sign if you want to petition for 7th style.
6829237	6830277	What do you think of that, Jamie?
6830998	6831458	I'll sign it.
6832259	6833019	What can it hurt, right?
6835180	6837122	This will be five whole seconds of my life.
6837182	6837962	I can never get back.
6839003	6842265	So after the break, we're going to come back and... Yes, for 7th style.
6842585	6847909	After the break, we're going to come back and we're going to announce the cage match winner.
6848589	6849910	And we're going to club baby seals.
6850310	6852211	We're going to have hot monkey sex.
6852512	6853832	No, you can have hot monkey sex.
6853893	6854313	And then...
6855703	6861985	And then you'll wake up on an island with these shiny new necklaces.
6862606	6863426	I'll break something.
6863446	6864846	Sometimes I like to kick people in the nuts.
6865267	6867427	Actually, I know one.
6867447	6868368	Pull up my DeviantArt page.
6886175	6889456	I have clips on my DeviantArt page.
6889476	6891897	By the time I pull up your DeviantArt page, I'll have the music ready.
6892157	6892817	Bullshit.
6893517	6895038	Okay.
6896538	6897939	Alright, we're going to take a quick break.
6897959	6903761	We're going to play some more old school Beatmania stuff because, you know, it was so popular last time.
6904181	6907482	And since we're not going to have monkey sex, we'll start with Drunk Monkey instead.
6908022	6908543	We'll be back.
6908703	6909703	You're listening to Orange Launch Radio.
6994757	6996022	Thanks for watching!

7129313	7130974	Don't you love me?
7130994	7133296	You're the city How can I win your heart?
7154233	7162899	In a moment of love, nothing will calm me down Did you really love me?
7162919	7179511	Daddy, hold me tight No more willow wings, I've got to make my move You were a dreamy romp, if you knew how I feel Baby, can't you see, to make you mine
7194639	7199101	Listen to Orange Lounge Radio Because Bongo demands it
7217603	7219464	Alright, so that's tonight's Big Cage Match winner.
7219504	7222146	Now we have an extra special treat for this evening.
7222766	7226788	As you may or may not know, sometimes on this station when we're bored, we'll do a fuck-off show.
7227269	7230851	So, Jamie did one of these the other night, last night, right?
7231171	7234353	Usually it's just me putting in a random comment and then playing five hours of music.
7234893	7240719	And since we don't have a whole lot else to talk about tonight, we thought we'd treat you with an hour clip of one of these fuck-off shows.
7240739	7241940	And it was fun, wasn't it, Jamie?
7242020	7244822	Yeah, the theme of my fuck-off last night was stupid laws.
7245323	7246083	Stupid laws.
7246584	7251708	So that's going to take you out the last hour of tonight's show, and then it's all done, you guys.
7251809	7254531	But before that, so that I can let you hear it.
7254831	7258915	Oh, we're going to do the outro of the show first and then go into that.
7258935	7259676	We'll not do the outro.
7259696	7260256	Don't worry about that.
7260276	7262118	Just do the fortune cookie.
7262138	7264641	I have something else funny that we can use as a normal fortune cookie.
7265521	7265782	Okay.
7265882	7267483	Go ahead and join in.
7267523	7268184	You need to hear this.
7268224	7268784	So this is it.
7268824	7270966	This is the normal fortune cookie for tonight.
7271007	7271307	Here we go.
7274238	7275579	Car theft is on the rocks.
7276000	7278963	In America, a car is stolen every 12 seconds.
7279563	7281025	What can you do to protect your car?
7281645	7285229	An expensive car alarm system won't protect your car from being stolen.
7285790	7288432	The club won't protect the valuables inside your car.
7289013	7291355	But a big black guy named Ben can.
7291575	7293577	Get away from the car, motherfucker.
7294298	7297361	For less than you'd pay for an expensive car alarm system, and even
7299248	7302971	You can get a big black guy named Ben to protect your automobile.
7303191	7305193	Get away from the car, motherf***er.
7306053	7306974	It's simple to use.
7307374	7312358	Just leave the big black guy named Ben in your car whenever you get out, and he does the rest.
7312739	7319324	Whenever anyone gets within six feet of your car, Ben simply gets out of the car and tells them... Get away from the car, motherf***er.
7320086	7324449	Listen to these testimonials from people who use a big black guy named Ben.
7324610	7330914	It's always nice to have someone to ride with, although he really doesn't say much, just... Get away from the car, motherfucker.
7332435	7333096	That's about it.
7333776	7336098	I didn't get a big black guy named Ben to chat with.
7336418	7337900	I got him to protect my car.
7338220	7340281	It's the best investment I've ever made.
7341262	7342323	My neighborhood isn't that great.
7342918	7344359	There have been a lot of car thefts.
7344599	7348582	I can't tell you how many times I've heard... Get away from the car, motherfucker!
7348982	7353285	Knowing that I've got a big black guy named Ben protecting my car lets me sleep better at night.
7353626	7356227	Call now, 1-800-1-BIG-GUY.
7356468	7359650	That's 1-800-1-B-I-G-G-U-Y.
7360050	7364773	And instead of hearing this... You'll hear this.
7365094	7367075	Get away from the car, motherfucker!
7369136	7369156	D...
7370529	7372410	Alright, so, that's it.
7372751	7373331	Good night, you guys.
7373711	7375072	Can't wait for the carameldansen.
7375873	7382837	We're going to the tape bit now, and so enjoy the next hour, and thanks for joining us on this very special edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
7384078	7384779	Final thought, Jamie?
7385860	7387481	You get to listen to how bad I sucked last night.
7387701	7388521	Final thought, Greg?
7391183	7391944	Coleslaw sucks.
7392924	7393765	Evan, final thought?
7395166	7397207	What is the sound of cheese in the morning?
7397588	7397968	Is it you?
7399011	7400334	or is it what you want to be?
7402179	7404745	And my final thought is PUSSY!
7405527	7405868	Goodnight.
7409032	7422439	Now, just to go ahead and say this again, we are recording for the Sunday show because both Rob and I will be off at Rocky, doing a Rocky show in Davis.
7422940	7425121	More details on that in a minute.
7426361	7430584	So if you're hearing me say all this crap right now and it's Sunday, I ain't here.
7432577	7436259	Anyway, I'm going to go ahead and get into some other stuff.
7436299	7441043	They're downstairs watching Futurama or playing Zelda or some crap.
7442824	7444425	So here's some music.
7445946	7449809	So here's some music.

8146152	8148273	I am closing AOL.
8148953	8150334	Guys seem like crap.
8150974	8151434	Goodbye.
8151774	8155055	Anyway, this is a request.
8158716	8159796	Well, it was requested.
8160377	8164858	Anyway, I'm going to be live a bit more tonight to go ahead and...
8167895	8169678	Make some interesting conversation.
8169718	8172101	Of course, it's all one-sided, since you can't talk back.
8173803	8174905	Anyway, here's the request.
