Message for you, son!
Attention!
Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.
Orange Lounge may contain adult cunt.
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
Just kidding.
Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.
In this episode... Hey, are there any balls down there?
That's the biggest berry you've ever seen, Jingleberry.
What's your favorite sugar?
Showgirls.
Absolutely frightful.
What's yours?
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.
Don't torture yourself.
That's my job.
Now's the time on sprockets, baby dogs!
I'll get you, my pretty.
And your little dog, too.
I know Kung Fu.
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
Why did they have to take the word gay?
No!
What I expect from Spanish exposition is gender.
Hey!
DarkSakura, Shut up!
Where's my gun?
This is my boomstick!
Sky, Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!
Loki, I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.
What kind of warping being would find that funny?
Orange Lounge Radio We are live, but not really.
And this is episode number 42 for April the 27th of 2003.
You're tuned into the Bomani Scene's most premeditated radio station of all things, the money.
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.
You know her better as DarkSakra.
Or tonight, as her name tag says, Miss Pac-Man.
I like your shirt, that's a cool shirt.
It's retro.
It's retro.
Uh, Loki is out today because he's doing stuff.
He broke his track record again.
I know, it's amazing.
I don't know what he's doing tonight, he's just doing stuff.
Yeah, he's fepping.
He's pecking and fepping.
Um, actually, we have a secret.
We're not really live tonight.
No, we're really dead.
We're actually...
Unless it's Thursday for you right now.
If it is Thursday the 24th, then yes, we're live.
Because we're premature this week.
We came a little early this week to your sound waves.
Um, yeah, so it's going to be an interesting show tonight because there's just, there's really not a lot tonight.
It's just, it's just Jamie and me and we might have one special guest who's around here somewhere and we're just going to talk about stuff.
Yeah.
We're both in, Jamie and I are both kind of in moods where we just don't give a fuck.
Yeah.
My socks are stripy.
Yo, I like your socks, they're pretty.
Sam said that I look like the little bitch that you are.
I'll get you if I break you.
Does he know?
Yeah, so let's take a quick break.
We're going to start off with some old school 5K songs.
Visit our chat room.
Calibamani.com, click on Orange Lounge, click on chat.
Thanks for watching!
In the city where the light of the sun shines, that person left a shadow and disappeared.
I loved you with a sudden goodbye.
I realized at that time.
Memories wake up when I forget them in a dream.
I love you, we looked at each other, we hugged each other, you kissed me Even if it was just a casual kiss, I knew it I knew there was no such thing as a painful past Once again, just a little bit more, I want to shake your hand
Thank you for watching!
Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange and Orange Bay Money Music and More show?
The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.
It's unearthly.
It's like being in a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.
Hey, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 42.
And tonight, we're being a little bit sneaky.
We're actually pre-taped tonight.
But that doesn't mean there isn't a party going on when we're not around.
Mommy and Daddy aren't home in the chat room, so I'm sure there's plenty of people causing a commotion.
So go on in there and party with them.
They're over at www.callybomani.com.
And you click on Orange Lounge, and then you click on Chat.
And join all our obsessive creatures.
I don't click on Chat.
Yeah, don't click on that button that says don't click me.
Yeah, don't click on the one that says big piles of poopy.
Click here for Goat Say.
Yuck.
That was another April Fool's joke.
I was like, how can you do Goat Say radio?
Maybe next year for April Fool's we can play gay porn over the air.
I'll pipe in my yaoi collection.
Oh my god, I finally did monkey sex on Orange Lounge.
Pooh, I sing pooh.
Pooh.
What was it I was watching that had the monkey jacking off?
Well, Conan O'Brien has the masturbating bear.
No, it was I think a video tape of these people at the zoo when the monkey was blinking.
They show that on cable or something?
I don't remember.
That's one of those Skinamax clips you got to pay extra for.
Oh my god, I watched the blue girl live action.
La Blue Girl Live Action.
God, it was horrible.
Describe La Blue Girl for the uninitiated.
Tentacle Pond.
It was an anime.
It was really crappy, but oh my god, I never need to see that again.
It was like volume three or something.
Oh, so there's more than one?
Yeah, it's like a story.
Is the acting as bad as it was in the anime?
Yeah.
Actually, there was some decent acting, but other than that, it was a little like, Oh, it's a garden hose!
Oh, it's going in my mouth!
It looked like they were, like, spitting up vegetable oil.
I neglected to introduce our special guest tonight.
Hi to Brad, by the way.
Um... Oh, shit.
I had something I was going to say.
Yes.
Suck it!
Suck it good!
Uh-uh.
Oh, I hit his teeth.
Oh, my bad.
I'm going to wipe it off now.
Excuse me.
That's really good radio.
Today, we're painting on Orange Lounge Radio.
We're going to make a happy cloud.
Happy white clouds.
Happy white clouds with cocaine.
I was so sad when Bob Ross died.
What other people have died recently that made me go, Mr. Rogers?
Oh, Nell Carter.
She was cool.
Shut up.
I like Nell Carter.
She was cool.
I used to watch Gimme a Break.
Gimme a Break?
Oh, I don't know.
So, yeah, interesting week for us.
I think we've all just been very busy and doing, like, random sorts of things.
Like, it's been like a crazy week for me.
My car passed smog.
Your car passed smog?
Yay!
Yeah, doing 50.
It's been really random.
Yeah?
I've been working on pictures.
I have a desk lamp.
Cool.
It clips onto my shelf.
It makes things bright so I don't go blind when I draw.
Thanks for watching!
It's a tongue twister, nipple clamp lamp.
That's the new erotic song, isn't it?
Yes, the new erotic single, nipple clamp lamp.
Yeah, it's the B-side to temple of butt.
You know what's interesting is that Dark Tetsuya, who's an obsessive listener of this show, pointed out in the chat room a while back that actually in an earlier episode, and he cites episode 12,
I apparently actually said something about Mr. Rogers is not dead.
Or something like that.
I don't remember the exact quote.
Yeah, at that point Mr. Rogers was not dead.
Yeah, at that point Mr. Rogers was not dead.
It was just funny that we brought it up on the show.
By the way, and I appreciate our listeners.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Do you remember episode 3?
No.
Oh my god, I wasn't here.
Yeah, you weren't here.
I remember that.
Because I remember when Orange Lounge Radio started, you were here the first week.
We had everybody here the first week.
And then the second and third week, it was like, I'm going to Anime Expo.
Bye.
That was it, too.
I was like, I'm in L.A.
Bye.
I'm in San Diego.
Bye.
And then we were just kind of here without Jamie for a couple weeks.
And then I went to Alabama.
Bye.
Oh, I'm stuck in traffic in San Francisco.
I don't think... Did the show... Was Alabama... I thought Alabama happened before.
We've been doing the show since...
June 23rd.
June 23rd.
Who else would I hire?
Matt Jamie or Matt But, oh well Not me I'm just a show delinquent It's all good
Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
So, God, what else is new this week?
It's such an interesting show tonight because there's just nothing to talk about.
You call that interesting?
I know, aren't you excited about tonight's show?
Hey, listeners, I know how to get you excited.
Go download some porn.
It's funny.
Let's just get drunk.
That'll be funny.
I'm just kidding.
Actually, I don't work tomorrow.
I can get drunk, sure.
Let's just pretend we're getting drunk, and then if the show's really bad because we're lagging, we can just say we were drunk, sorry.
Jamie will get drunk and I'll get high, and then you'll be sober, so it'll have the best of all of our lives.
Why don't I... You can get drunk, you can get high, and I'll have sex.
I'll be in the other room.
Sounds like the real world.
No, because we need to have, we need...
We need a black person.
We need either an Asian or a Pacific Islander.
We need to have... Yeah, we need a person with bad hygiene.
We need everybody to hate somebody else.
We need the racist.
And the racist has to be a roommate with a black person.
We have Loki.
We have Loki.
I don't know where Loki is tonight.
He just said he wouldn't be available tonight.
I think he's either fapping or he's probably getting ready for the movie on Saturday, which is one reason we're taped tonight.
Maybe he's having special time with a significant other.
That's possible, too.
Who has time for relationships?
I sure don't.
Yeah, see, there's like a special on The Matrix tonight, so...
Well, there is a little bit of news.
Actually, there's a lot of news.
We're just being lazy.
We're procrastinating for next week.
Who said we'd bring you news timely?
Come on.
You know what I realized?
We kind of lied last week.
We did?
We said that last week was the last episode of Orange Lounge Radio from this studio.
But we're actually in the studio tonight.
Tonight's the last episode in the studio.
Even though we're pre-taped.
I'm confused.
I just went cross-eyed.
Yeah.
I want ice cream.
Let's go get ice cream.
Fuck this show.
Bye.
I had salad today.
Did you?
From where?
The grocery store.
Did you toss your salad?
Yes, I did, actually.
It landed on the cat.
You know what's funny?
I had a salad today, too, and I shook my salad.
Alright, uh, one interesting thing that's in Bomani News this week.
Dancemania EX3 just came out, and I don't have a copy, and I want one.
So somebody get me one.
What the fuck's on this one this time?
Get this.
Ace of Base, first track.
How cool is that?
Jamie's blinking.
Um... This is great.
Creamy has a song on Dancemania EX3 called Help, I'm a Fish.
Cool!
I have to listen to that.
Oh my god.
Yes, track six is called Help, I'm a Fish.
New Smile DK, new Captain Jack, new Bus Stop, new 2 Unlimited, new DJ Alligator, new Lasco, which is like no surprise if you've been following the EX series.
A trance remix of Erotic, Gimme Gimme Gimme, the 2003 mix.
And then another creamy song, a remix of I Do, I Do, I Do.
I'm looking forward to Help I'm a Fish.
As soon as we get a copy of that, we'll play that for y'all.
That'll be fun.
And Bus Stop, it looks like this time around, is covering I Was Made for Loving You.
I was made for loving you, baby.
You know, the only way I remember that song is through Moulin Rouge.
I've never seen that.
I know, you've never seen Moulin Rouge.
We've got to make you watch that sometime.
But there's this part where they, you know, they're going back and forth between all these love songs, and then there's that part where I was made for loving you, baby.
You were made for loving me.
I should never sing on this show.
Yes.
Indeed.
I might.
Any other fun Dance Mania albums coming out that we should give a mention to?
Dance Mania, my ass mixer.
What'll be on that?
I was made for Party On You.
Beautiful.
Lovely.
I was made for Stiffy Glue.
Other fun, happy, fun news this week.
This has nothing to do with Bomani, but a lot of you that follow Bomani also follow Konami.
And Konami has another game series that's somewhat popular.
It's known a little bit.
It's Castlevania.
And get this.
The new Castlevania is coming out.
And look at that.
It's 3D.
Are you on Castlevania Dungeon?
Yes.
Okay, wait a second, but the last time I tried to do a 3D Castlevania game, it sucked shit.
Wait, I'm not sure this is new.
Yeah, it was up yesterday.
Okay, you know what?
But this is what it says at the bottom.
It says, the article says this game will be entirely in 3D, but is not intended to be like Castlevania 64, which the producer openly admitted to hating.
The game takes place in the 11th century, apparently, but other story details are pretty vague.
God damn it, they need to do another one with Richter.
Everybody pray to whatever god you believe in that this game does not suck, please.
They need another game with Richter.
Or as Maria said it in the English version, Richter.
Um, you know, you're forgetting another comic game.
What's that?
Freaking Gradius V. When's that come out?
New.
It's soon.
It's new!
I think it's soon.
Gradius V on PS2.
On the piece of shit 2.
Sorry.
I don't know what it is.
Now... Just because they took, like, parts out of old, like, space shuttles and stuff to make this thing doesn't mean it's, like, it doesn't do that.
I just think people can't program for it for shit, or else we would definitely have games that looked better.
Metal Gear Solid 2 was nice, but it was better on Xbox, I have to say.
It, it, because there was more room for anti-aliasing.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh my god!
You know what?
Tekken 3 and Metal Gear Solid on Bling.
Bling bling.
I don't know.
I have nothing really to say on Castlevania.
You know what's interesting?
I don't own a PlayStation 2 American, and I'm not really going to be importing any games outside of...
I'm gonna be getting Final Fantasy 7 too, hopefully next month I've already seen the ending
No spoilers.
You could just get a mod chip and, you know.
No.
Why?
Because any other game that's going to come out after that is not going to work.
Okay, I used to say that when the PS2 just came out because it's understandable, you know, it just came out.
But now PS2's kind of, it's starting to become the end of its life and all the best games that are out, I mean.
So how about when you, if you mod your system now and then 7th style comes out and it won't work with your system?
Then I'll go buy 7thfile I mean, 7thfile will work as a purchased version I don't need to take pictures of it to play it And 7thfile won't come out What?
What, Rob?
What?
Well...
I've heard that before about, you know, that you get the mod chip and then Sony could release a game that would basically fuck up your mod chip.
Or, you know, they override the copy protection, kind of like they did with the early chips on PS1s.
Sony was even doing it right to the end of the PlayStation's life.
Right.
And what's interesting about that is what they could do with it is they could do it through online purposes.
It's possible, you know, if your PS2 is online, you go online with Final Fantasy XI...
And then, sneak sneak, it's updating your BIOS That's why I just won't play it on the computer Because it's coming out for computer in America
By the way, if anyone is interested in that, if you go to squareenixusa.com, you can submit an application to beta test Final Fantasy XI for PC or for PS2.
I really hope they choose me to do the beta test.
Please, please, Square, I've played your game since the beginning.
Well, not since the beginning.
I'm more than positive I'm going to get selected because I've done game beta testing before.
I played Ragnarok Online, ew.
Yeah, that sucks they didn't continue that over here, because I really want to play Ragnarok.
You lucky people.
They're still in beta testing right now.
Yeah, but it's like they're only working with... The paid release is going to be out, I think, for the next couple months.
And they are going to America with it?
Because it sounded like they were neglecting America.
They have an American beta test open right now.
Well, I mean, it's a closed beta, but they have it going on right now.
I know it's been talked about on here, but for those who don't know, Ragnarokonline.com, I don't know how it's spelled, R-A-G-N-O-R...
R-A-G-N-A-R, okay.
Okay.
It's a really cool game, it's like Secret of Mana online or something, kind of.
Is that what you'd say?
Yeah.
It's 3D environment, 2D characters.
That's actually what I was thinking, is that every time I see Ragnarok online, I go, God, I really want to play a Secret of Mana online.
Seriously.
R.O.
's about the closest you can get.
It's like, it's like Secret of Mana with Final Fantasy Tactics type job systems.
And grasshoppers that play the fiddle.
Fucking fiddle playing grasshoppers.
POPCAP.COM
It still needs a lot of tweaking, but it's interesting.
It's worth checking out.
Go to popcap.com because it's free.
I think if you pay money, you get special things.
Hey, I'm still doing Neopets, okay?
I have not checked on my Neopet in two weeks.
I don't want to give you my money.
If you're loving your pet, give me your money.
Why?
So that I can get up to 500,000.
I think I have like 25,000.
That's actually about what I need.
Really?
Mwahaha.
Seriously, I've been trying to get up to... Is that like the last level of saving?
No, that's about three from it.
I'm trying to upgrade to my next bank account.
Okay, why don't we take ourselves a quickie little break.
We're going to come back.
We're going to talk about Max 2.
Max 2, Japan, came out this week, and there's been some interesting early reaction.
We're sitting here on Thursday night, pre-taping Sunday's show, and there's already been some early reaction.
Some folks in the States have picked it up and have some interesting things to say about it.
So we will take a quick break.
About the overwhelming lack of monkeys.
Yes, about the lack of monkey sex.
We're going to play some Anothers for the hell of it.
We're feeling saucy, so let's start this off with Spica, Another.
And we'll be back on Orange Lounge Radio.
and many more.
Thanks for watching!
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
Because Bongo demands it.
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
I hope you enjoyed those and others.
It was Spica, Leading Cyber, and Reincarnation.
You know what?
I've actually never heard Reincarnation and others before.
Because usually I'm too chicken to play and others on 2DX because I don't want to waste my money.
Shut up.
And I was sitting here going, this song isn't any different.
And then finally they're like, wait.
Jamie and Brad are like, wait.
Wait for it.
Wait for it!
And then finally in the end it has that... It has a little way different part at the end, so... What a cool... Roll to see if I'm getting drunk.
Alright, you're getting drunk!
Blink, blink.
Got any Mountain Dew?
We're talking about the potential...
Battle Royale
is basically what it has come down to.
You've got this little inside cult of folks here locally in Sacramento and abroad because it's kind of spawned from the Orange Lounge chat room and then some of just this obsession with the movie Battle Royale.
And now... I'm running a game probably in a few weeks.
Me and Jas and now Pepe's involved.
And Puppy's testing his dice script in our chat room right now.
But, um, we're, uh, yeah, it's gonna be definitely dice-based.
Um, let's go ahead and give a couple little spoilers about that.
We've already selected what the random weapons are.
Ooh.
We have already, there's going to be, people are going to have certain skills like people normally do.
You've got your stats, we'll help you with that.
I'm sort of half deciding of having the game last a few weeks more than just the normal, however many it takes to kill everybody off.
So you can establish what your character's like and your friends and your group before you decide to kill each other off.
So how exactly is it going to work?
Is it going to be like a chat room that runs 24 hours a day?
No.
No, it's only going to be a certain day and time.
It's going to be probably three hours, the game should last, or until we say, okay, we're tired.
Got it.
And it's going to be one night a week.
I'll do my best to put it on a Friday night.
I'm thinking a Friday night would be the best night for this.
and basically you roleplay and if you suck at roleplay by the way as in you're not staying in character you're not developing your character even though your character is going to die you'll just die all the faster because I'm a pretty spiteful GM which is probably why I will not be participating because I suck at roleplay I was always there to provoke the GM in interesting ways
I sometimes think that it's a little bit easier to roleplay online as opposed to tabletop.
Just because you have a little bit more room for some description.
If you're a shy person by nature, you don't have to say something that you would normally be uncomfortable saying.
It's easier to type it.
Ah, you need to roleplay and say that in a British accent.
Yes.
Anyway, as promised... Oh yeah, Brad, do you have something you want to say?
No.
Okay.
As we promised before the break... I killed you!
We were going to talk about... Max 2 just came out in Japan this week.
And there's probably more information on it now that it's Sunday, but it's only Thursday when we're taping here.
And we don't know a lot at this point.
However, we do know what the unlocks are.
So...
The unlocks that you're going to get in Max 2, you've got me burping.
That's the first unlock.
No, the next unlock is all of the remixes.
Actually, I don't know what order these unlock in.
Sorry, I haven't gotten a list or anything.
But you get all the remixes, the Max 2 remixes that you can play in Extreme.
and then we know that you can unlock Crash or actually I think that's one of the songs you start off with is Crash and then Paranoia Survivor and there was one more Love Love Shine or Love Love Sugar one of those two Love Love Shine it's Love Love Shine you get you also unlock
Almost everything from Max USA that was exclusive, except the license tracks.
So you get Shining Polaris, Peace Out, Overblast, Logical Dash, Jammin' Marmalade, and I'm For Real.
You get all that.
And you also get Look to the Sky, True Color, Dynamite Rave, Downbird Soda.
You get all those songs.
We had them first.
Yeah, we had them first, so Nina.
And we still have... I like to move it.
Also, for whatever reason, they're bringing back Kind Lady and So In Love.
I mean, those songs are pretty cool and all, but it's kind of interesting because they were on the last mix.
Also, there's some brand spanking new stuff.
Do It Right, the 80s electro mix.
which is remixed by Soda.
And I hear it's pretty good.
We had some folks in the chatroom that have heard it, and it's pretty good.
As soon as we get MP3s, we'll play them for you guys.
Kind Lady, The Interlude.
Whatever that could mean.
I wonder if that's just that little groove beat at the beginning.
You know that?
It's kind of like... You sounded like a banjo.
Rob does bluegrass.
You know what?
What?
Yeah, I want to get an MP3, so I don't have to sing this.
I'm trying to find an MP3 so you can hear what I'm talking about here.
Okay, like this part.
Like the porno part.
We used that in a porn movie.
Yeah, we did.
I remember that.
Right.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.
Sure, yeah.
Also unlockable...
Look to the Sky, the Trance Mix, which is not Look to the Sky, the True Color Mix.
Now there's going to be three Look to the Skies all together.
Look to the Sky, Fart Mix.
Look to the Sky, because it stinks down below.
Yeah, how about, you know, like, look up to the skirt or something.
Yeah.
So you only get those three new songs, or pretty much the only super-duper new songs.
Also, they had to retool all of the Oni courses.
I said tool.
They had to retool all of the Oni courses, so you have the Oni courses more light, which is like some easy stuff, it's like the lesson Oni.
B4U, of course, because where would we be without a B4U-only course?
Nearly 130, however, since a minute it did not make it into Max 2 home version, they have Spin the Disc replacing a minute.
Spin the Dicks.
They have the From 2DX course, except now it has Gemma Marmalade and all these other songs.
The Love Song Collection, which is Baby Love Me, So In Love, Silent Hill, Dive Into The Night, which I never knew was a love song, and My Summer Love.
Now they have a DJ Soda Oni, which is pretty cool.
A middle tempo course, which is just kind of all like... Okay, I'm just noticing something.
It says DJ Soda Oni.
Why is Kind Lady in there?
I thought it was Okuyatos.
But Kind Lady Interlude, I believe, is remixed by Soda Oni.
Answer my question?
Alright.
And then you have the middle tempo chorus, which is kind of like a bunch of Dance Mania songs.
You have a chorus called Rap Mania.
And these are the songs that apparently are rap, according to Konami.
Long Train Runnin', Little Boy, Superstar, Hysteria, D2A, Burnin' the Floor, and Be For You.
Yes.
The Midnight Blue course is back, except they've replaced one song with another AM3P remix.
I don't know what song they took out, but... Do you remember the original Midnight Blue course?
Alright, whatever, fine.
Now they have a BPM 140 course, so now we have nearly 130 and nearly 140.
A tricky course, which I'm not sure yet, but rumor... Yeah, rumor is it's like the trick Oni in Extreme.
It's got changes in it.
A random Oni course, and this is the thing.
Not only is it random songs, but it's random modifiers.
We had a fellow in the chatroom, you know him if you listen to the show religiously, Jazz, was playing random...
And the random came up with Kind Lady, Reverse, nothing gonna stop, no mods, Silent Hill, Sudden, Mysterio 2001, Reverse, Boost, and then like Burning Heat, 2-speed, Boost, Reverse, and then Kind Lady, 3-speed, Boost.
So like it just fucks up all your modifiers.
There's a Naoki Platinum course, which actually, I believe, is the same course.
I think that's the one course that retained itself.
Wow, I'll be damned.
Um, some course in Japanese, that I'll... I don't know, I can't translate.
It has a star in it, so it's not really all Japanese.
Hmm, something woman?
Is it like the D.Va course?
It could be.
I think these are all... Yeah, these are all songs by women.
Yeah, what's up?
Copy that.
Oh, and put it into Globalgate?
Yeah, but I know one of them is from the film.
Well, let's see.
Let's translate that.
And the answer is... Unicron.
Maiden Way.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Then it's Girls' Course.
That might be just a normal, pure translation, but it might be something else.
I think it's like Girls' Course.
It's my Girls' Course!
Up and Down is another course.
I have no idea what these songs have in common.
And then there's the Shitty Demon Road.
What about the Ultra 64?
Not to my mommy.
Not to my mommy.
So you can order that now, DDR Max 2.
And also, if you ordered it from Konami Style already, you'll be getting a VRare CD.
And what's interesting is that those tracks on the VRare CD that we talked about, like Glacial, the I Feel remix, the Soda remix of I Feel and all that stuff, not in Max 2.
They're just there.
Yeah, they'll probably be in a future one.
So we shall see.
Oh yeah, if you haven't already heard yet, there's some other features in there, like you can create your own Oni course.
So, anything else you guys want to say about Max 2?
Nobody got it for me for my birthday, so I have to get it next month.
I have more money, but I didn't even buy it for myself.
I have something to say.
This DDR sucks.
Thank you.
That's very nice.
You're rapping cool.
Let's see, what else?
I'm looking at the official DDR Max 2 website.
I'm just trying to see if there's any, like, new information or anything cool.
Doesn't look like it.
What?
I'm what?
Fuck the chatroom.
No, I'm just kidding.
I love the chatroom.
He loves the chatroom for dinner.
Op, I have foods.
Chuck chuck.
Get you the hot bullets of shotgun to die.
Tell us about that story, Brad.
No.
Please, please.
I've been hearing from DarkSakura's SO that he's been saying this thing.
He goes, get you the hot shotgun bullets to die.
And it's kind of like in the vein of All Your Base, you know, bad English, some bad translation from an old Japanese game.
I found out on English.com, which I love.
Go check it out, English.com.
Great.
Makeup, you're on Ingrish!
We're going to translate Konami's Q&A on Max 2, and we're going to read it.
So it's like a radio drama, so this will be fun.
So this segment is called... Ingrish Like What?
Ingrish Like What?
Ingrish Like What?
Ingrish Like What?
Ingrish Like What?
Alright.
Alright, who wants to be question man and who wants to be answer man?
Alright Brad, are you Question Man or Answer Man?
I'll be Question Man.
Alright, Question Man, first question.
You sound like you're Mega Man.
Question Man, I will ask you questions.
Okay, so we have it in English?
Is this it?
Okay.
Can an exclusive controller be used even if set to PS2?
Please feel easy!
An exclusive controller and exclusive use hand controller also operate satisfactory.
Yay!
This is a question?
This is a question?

Isn't the function in which a screen position can be adjusted carried in Dan Dan's resolution?
The screen adjustment function of demand is added to option from the second edition DDR Max 2 of PS.
Please confirm by options.
Graphic, options, screen adjustment.
Oh my god.
You know what?
Okay.
And that was Max 2 English.
Max to English, Max to English, Max to English I think it was English like what originally?
Whatever.
Oh yeah, sorry.
English like what?
English like what?
Okay.
You know what's funnier, because I've done this before, is going to the Konami site, the 2DX site, where they have interviews with some of the artists for the new songs on each version.
Translate that shit, it's really fucking awful.
And by the way, the site used for the translations is nifty.com slash victory Hey, I have Samurai Shodown on Neo Geo And it does say victory
You know what's funny?
If you have any of the Japanese games, like I have the Japanese Samurai Spirits 2, which is Samurai Shodown, it'll play it in American mode and turn all the blood into sweat.
So like these big geysers of white fluid come shooting out of their bodies.
Unbelievably powerful.
You are now finally the strongest pro team except your challenge.
My spirit burns like the sun and I shall dry you like a prune
You want to know what's... Alright, next show that we do, I'll tell you what.
I will bring the manual for Samurai Shodown.
It is the funniest thing ever.
Because, like, it's completely English the whole time.
It talks about Amakusa, who is the bad guy, saying, Amakusa's quest is for world domination and a truly tasty cup of coffee.
I kid you not.
Here's the ending to Ghosts and Goblins.
Being the wise and courage adore... Adore!
Night that you are, you feel strong swelling in your body Return to starting point, challenge again Are you full of strong?
I feel this strong swelling inside my body Maybe I shouldn't have told you guys that I think you need to see a doctor for that condition
Air Fortress Spacey Music
On the planet Farmel, they had the glorious days for two centuries.
Since the star date had established, they sailed all around the galaxy with new type spaceship called Lightship.
But one day the peace was disturbed by a mysterious big fortress.
It was living and was destroying all other civilizations.
The Federal Bureau of Galactic Government organized the Defense Force immediately, but as the Air Fortress had very high potential, the Defense Sea Force was wiped out in vain.
So the Federal Bureau has decided to select a specially trained man, ID-2592 named Hal Bailman, and has developed new type lightbrancer and armored suit.
Now he departs for the Air Fortress with the destiny of Farmel.
Farmel, it sounds like Propel the sequel.
Formaldehyde flavored Propel?
Oh my.
Um, it's... Is it like a farming planet?
I don't know.
Whatever.
Man, they need to learn how to translate shit back into English.
It's like a shitty planet.
Congratulations, the story is happy end.
Thank you.
That's my favorite.
There's lots of other neat stuff on English.com, though.
English.com is highly recommended by the staff of Orange Launch Radio.
Hold on.
I have to read this one for you.
Okay.
It's like, I'm cock.
Or, what kind of world is this?
It's kind of crap.
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
His name is Raman Saurus.
He is urchin, has many... He is urchin, has many curiosity, but he is a person who makes much good looks.
Yeah, Raman Sauruses have an image to uphold.
There's a... Somebody?
What?
What are you looking for?
I think that I like the one that has World of Pain on it.
and then no smorking.
Thank you, man.
This is really, really brilliant radio.
Okay.
Okay, this is something that was posted on an evacuation map in a hotel in China.
Please keep calm when there is a fire.
The hotel will ensure your safety in shit with advanced fire facilities.
Please go to the exit according to the instructions so that our staff will lead you to safe zone.
Point profess your excellency.

Oh, the Every Day I Hate My Life.
I hate my life.
Every day I polish my revolver and I shoot my head like a rock star.
I'm cock, what?
I'm trying to read this chick's shirt.
It says, I'm cock.
I'm home, I'm all alone.
I need some her coffee.
Hot coffee.
There were three jovial Welshmen as I have some things.
and they would go hunting upon St.
David's said it was a ship that either he said the chimney blown away or whatever I want the one that says spread beaver showing the vaginal area it says showing the vaginal area
That's it.
Link that one in the chatroom.
I want that shirt.
I would wear that shirt.
Spread Beaver was actually the name of a band in Japan fronted by the ex-Japan guitarist Hide.
Yeah, but he's dead now.
Is he?
Yeah.
He hung himself in the door.
Everybody said he hung himself, but what I heard is that he, uh, what he actually did was, um, when he practiced his guitar sometimes, he would tie, like, a belt or something around his neck and then tie it to the back of a, um...
I have my hideplushie hanging from a doorknob.
I bought a hide plushie.
He has this string on his head so you can hang him up.
So I was hanging it from the doorknob by my finger.
Yeah, because apparently it was tied to the doorknob and that's when they found him or something.
That's really disgusting, but it's so funny.
I'm just, you know, being true to the original.
Oh, man.
Yeah, my JFK plushie has two bullet holes in its head and shoulder.
It's crazy.
Hey, let's listen to music.
Yes, let's listen to music.
We're going to take a quick break.
We're going to come back and do that one segment we can't get through a show without doing.
Fak you, man.
It's Jamie's Fak You of the Week and my Fak You of the Week.
I know I didn't pick a cake much this morning.
It's okay, we're not doing a cage match tonight.
Fuck it, I say he's not here.
Let's do one.
You want to do a cage match without Loki?
I'll fix it.
There's hardly... You know what the thing is, though, since we didn't really announce this, because we wanted this to be a treat.
For those of you that listen to Orange Homs Radio a lot, we wanted this sneak... A treat, the alternative to spam.
This sneak... Yeah, we wanted this sneak preview of what is sure to be a very... Turn off all pagers and cell phones.
Thank you.
Hope you have a nice play again.
Dot com.
We wanted this to be a special treat for those of you who listen to Orange Limes a lot to get to hear this show like before everyone else.
And aren't you happy?
Yeah, so we don't have a lot of people available to vote, but we can do one anyway.
Yes?
I think that we should do... What is this?
Guess My Cell Phone?
Fucked Up Trivia or something.
Things we hate, like Squeenix I don't know Hold on, I want to find my cool little ringer Oh god This is cell phone segment This is cell chat Wait, that's not it That one sucks Oh, there it is Okay, it's the entertainer How is that cool?
Because I'm entertaining
It was either that or this one.
I haven't played that in forever.
Anyway... No.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Play it for everybody?
I did.
You missed it.
Okay, hi.
We go to break now.
We're going to have a guitar freaky break.
And we'll be back with the FAQs of the week.
So you can send those over a private message right now to moi if you are in the chat room.
If it's Thursday.
If it's Sunday, you're listening to this Sunday 27th.
Sorry, we pre-taped tonight.
And you'll just have to send those in for next week.
If you send your FAQs of the week to Rob on Sunday, you're stupid.
And you'll get a FAQ right back.
We'll be back.
That's right, Joey Swift joined one.
Before there were words, communication was done through teeth.
Body language is controlled by rhythm.

Bitch, get a new song.
An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.
Funny enough, she never did find a new song.
We haven't heard from Joga in a long, long time.
Good.
You know what's interesting?
I don't... I don't... Okay.
We've talked about her on the show before, this Japanese rocker girl chick who's awesome.
Her name's Kana.
She would play Miku if you have it.
I think I might.
I think you've sent it to me.
Anyway, I have a point to this.
Our new friend Garrett, who we discovered randomly on a 2DX machine four weeks ago, and we just kind of picked him up and made him come home with us and play with us.
Not like that, you perverts.
I was showing him Kana videos the other night, and he was just laughing his ass off going, this is great, she's kind of like the Japanese Bjork.
And I had a point to this story, but I don't remember what it was.
I have a question.
Was she from a band originally?
I don't think so.
Okay, I guess she was from some other band.
She does the elegant... Gothic Lolita stuff?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I like when she's got a little panda thing.
And she does panda bondage.
Yeah, she does a lot of panda bondage, which is really weird, because they don't rate pandas, do you?
Poor pandas, they're like, you know... They don't even rate the pandas.
They're just wrapped in ribbons and bondaged it.
I was going to say, the WWF... Ribbon!
Rick, what?
Ribbon.
Ribbon?
Sorted!
Arrowed.
Ordinate.
What?
What?
Oh my.
Jamie's lost her... Jamie's lost her mind.
Whatever.
Yes.
But for some reason I thought she was from, like, Malice Miser, but that's Gak, I think.
Oh, this is bad.
Oh, this is bad.
Here is justice.
Here is my butt.
Um, my typhus relief goes to my back for fucking hurting.
Fuck it.
It hurts a lot.
It's been hurting me for like two weeks now and I've been thinking about getting it for it.
And I have, um, there's a
Other crap now that I'm going to take.
And I have this heat pad attached to my butt.
It's sort of like in my pants.
It's those ones that you wrap around your stomach.
Except I couldn't get it to sit low enough.
So I just tore the velcro parts off and stuck it in my pants.
So now it's warm.
My back is warm.
My lower back is warm.
But still, it hurts like fuck.
It hurts like...
Fondage Pops.
It hurts.
I don't know.
My other fucky again goes to Squeenix for sucking.
and another one goes toward having no money so I can't have my games right now and a happy fuck you goes to the ending of Final Fantasy X-2 which I'm not going to spoil for anybody but I like it but there needs to be more and also a fuck you again goes toward Final Fantasy X-2 for having a freaking confusing ass storyline so I guess I'm not going to get it until I actually play through the game
and, um, another one goes toward not really having any more and not getting that one.
Yeah, because I've had salad today and that's it.
Oh yeah, another funky goes toward not being able to digest anything.
That was beautiful, thank you.
Um, I have some FUs this week.
My biggest FU this week goes to procrastination.
You guys have seen the house, right?
And what's happening on Saturday?
I'm moving.
You're moving.
How many boxes have you seen that have been packed?
None.
There's one in the living room.
Oh, I didn't see.
Oh, uh-oh.
What have you got there, Rob?
So, I was given an interesting strategy on how to pack my shit because... Oh, that sounds dirty.
I was given an interesting strategy on how to pack stuff up... Wait, hold on.
Hold on.
Stop the presses.
Stop the presses.
Jamie has a joke.
If California were going to fall off into the ocean and everyone had to evacuate to an island, who do you think would be out first, the lesbians or the gay men?
Uh, the gay men.
Wrong, because the gay men would still be packing their shit while the lesbians are out looking to be split.
That was a good joke.
My next FU of the week goes to bad jokes.
Heard it in the taxi cab in Vegas.
Were you drunk?
God bless Vegas.
I think I might have been.
Yes, I was, because it was with me and Iguana Girl and Islander coming back from Circus Circus being drunk off Warp Core Breaches.
Playing drunk DVRs.
Well, anyway, I procrastinated and I haven't packed a damn thing yet and I'm moving on Saturday.
Actually, no, if you go out in my garage, I have a lot of shit in boxes.
I really do, but you know why?
Because I never unpacked last time.
That sounds like my house.
You saw my closet.
Yeah, yeah.
So, moving isn't going to be so bad.
I just have to pack this up, my bed up, my clothes.
All my clothes are going to be the hardest one, but that'll be easy.
Anywho, I had an interesting strategy sent to me on how to pack my stuff.
And this was sent to me by Garrett, same guy we were talking about earlier.
Get some big boxes and do something like label my boxes, upper right part of closet, lower left part of closet, shit on the floor in living room, and then fill them up accordingly.
That's how I pack.
I have another question.
I think I got bit by a spider.
On your cleavage.
Or your, if you're, you know, French.
Cleavage.
I think I got bit by a spider, so fuck that spider!
Jamie's gonna go get her cleavage wet.
Cleavage.
In the meantime, do I have any FUs left?
No.
Brad's turn.
How do you always give me this?
Because it's cute.
That's fuck you music.
Okay.
I had a fuck you, but my mind is rumbling because I just got a phone call.
Anyway.
What were we just talking about?
Okay.
Oh, yes, we were talking about Jamie's Breastises.
Okay, no, fuck you goes to people, and no offense, Jamie, but fuck you goes to people who spoil games for themselves, and waiting... No, for themselves, I mean, like, instead of waiting till the game comes out, they, like, read about the story, and Jamie's like, I'm getting the game anyway.
I'm poor, I can't have the game.
I don't have an architecture.
Um...
And I had something else, but I don't remember, so I want to eat.
I'm hungry.
Okay.
Say we fuck the show.
If we can make it through another half hour, I know we can.
And we can get to two hours.
Actually, we do have a present for the last hour of the show, so we'll get to that later.
A gift.
We're making a gift.
We've made a gift.
Actually, Jamie made a gift.
Fag Hags Community
I'm looking because Puppy sent me an interesting FU.
It involves a web link.
And he might have already deleted it.
He wants to give a big FU to somebody that posted something naughty in his girlfriend's journal.
I'm loading that up.
We'll come back to his FU.
Let's go to Zero's FUs.
F you to not being able to be there tonight.
Yeah, we're at zero.
We miss you.
F you to my legs giving out in the middle of Legend of Max all three times.
F you to my ass hurting as I fall to the ground on Legend of Max.
F you to stupid assholes who think because they live in my house they can fuck shit up.
DarkSakura, I think we can use those boxes.
Stop trying to get people to buy your fucking alcohol.
I think I will turn your stupid ass in.
DarkChild says, fuck you to the stupid 17-year-old girl who keeps calling me.
Although it would have been smarter to have given her the wrong phone number.
Hey, you know what?
I want to talk to her.
Let me talk to her.
Better yet, let's talk to her live on air.
Get her number.
I'll call her.
We'll find a way to tape the conversation.
Dark Tetsuya would like to say, Fuck not knowing what to do with crushes indeed.
And for Angel, fuck having to work and missing the surprise.
I know what you mean a little bit, actually.
I actually know what you mean very well.
John Fields would like to say, Hey!
Hey!
The wizard rules!
Hold on.
The Wizard, all those games, or movies, Double Dragon, you know, all sucked ass.
Actually, I haven't seen The Wizard, so I guess I shouldn't judge it.
But Resident Evil was probably the best.
Video game to movie production ever.
And if they're going to start doing, because movie producers and directors are starting to notice this kind of stuff is becoming popular, like the comic book movies, the big budget comic book movies that are coming out, I think they're going to do pretty good with the Metroid movie.
I'm hoping.
Oh man, it would suck if Drew Barrymore was Samus or something.
Oh my god.
There you go.
I was looking for my Power Glove, it's so bad quote, but I lost it, I'm so mad.
Oh well, anyway.
Wait, what?
Oh, okay.
For now, I have to change their song, hold on, Jamie's requesting I change the FU song for the chatroom.
Load, load, load, load, load, load.
Oh, this is happy.
I like this one.
Oh, this is good FU music.
I like this.
Alright, let's move on.
The 23rd Magus would like to say, FU to my screwy school schedule next week.
Everyone else has to take their stupid little tests, which leaves me in government class for five hours with no bathroom passes.
What the fuck?
FU to Angel's screwy work schedule.
Fet.
FU to having random DDRs at school begging me to take them to an Orange Lawns broadcast, which I will do, so fear.
Uh, sure you will.
Out.
Brack2000 would like to say FU to sore throats.
Everything tastes like, um, sore throats.
Chloroseptic is your friend.
Okay, I'm going back to puppies FU, but the damn page isn't loading because LiveJournal's being a biznatch.
God, it's the stupid tub girl thing.
God damn it, why'd you have to show that?
I didn't even let the whole thing load.
Like 20 pixels of it came up, I recognized it as being disgusting, and I flipped it off.
Stupid kids!
How can people pee me that color?
She must have been eating something.
Easy, it's Photoshop.
Goatse was funny.
That's the color of the Walmart that's on the corner of Arden and...
Not Walmart, Walgreens.
It's by the mall.
Let me think of when Goat Say was funny.
I think it was about five minutes.
Never.
Shame on you, puppy.
Bad puppy.
That's me beating puppy with a newspaper.
Bad puppy.
It was just that fucking tub girl.
Gross.
Rose, yeah, now I'm not hungry.
Thank you.
Hey, you know what?
Fuck you, man.
Back you to Black Lab.
Just kidding.
We love Black Lab.
For dinner.
Mmm, fried puppy.
I think at that Genghis Kong Mongolian barbecue I had some puppies there.
You're mean.
Puppy says it was more than that.
Um, fuck you.
Don't.
Fuck you goes to my pants.
Oh, it's a 20-picture montage.
God.
Alright, look away.
Here's your chance.
Of course, that means, like, everybody's watching now.
Who the hell did it?
Oh, it's gone.
Puppy deleted it.
Who the fuck did that anyway?
No, let me know who did it.
Save their ID.
It was anonymous.
You can IP track them.
Yeah, you should log IPs.
That's how I track them.
If you want to plot some revenge, get with Jamie.
I've done it.
I have done it.
And there are ways you can trace somebody down to their zip code to find out where they live by their IP address.
Jamie's a geek.
In a good way.
That's how I knew who it was, that it wasn't, you know, who spammed my live journal.
It was his friend that did it.
Oh, okay.
It was anonymous and their IP tracking wasn't turned on.
So now's a good time to turn that on.
Turn on the IP tracking and disallow anonymous posting.
Anyway, let's take a break.
Another break.
And we'll be back and we'll wrap up kind of like this segment of the show and then we're going to move into another segment of the show.
It's going to be interesting.
We're experimental tonight.
We aren't live, but you should still come into the chat room.
We're live right now.
Well, we're live on Thursday.
Yeah, right now we're live.
If it's Thursday, we're live.
If it's Sunday, we're not.
Actually, no, because we rebroadcast.
The Thursday rebroadcast usually.
Anyway, fuck it.
Whatever.
Fuck it.
Either we're live or we're not.
Just go to the chat room and they'll tell you.
Go to KaliBumani.com Click on Orange Lounge Click on chat While I choke on something And in the meantime, let's play Let's play Usaukun Let's play it the whole way through And we'll play some other stuff from Keyboard Mania Because Keyboard Mania is happy, fun, joy dance Usaukun Usaukun

Hello?
Hello, is this thing on?
Testing.
Testing, one, two.
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.
Hello?
I don't understand this.
Does this thing work?
This thing reads like stereo instructions.
Is this on?
What the hell?
Orange Lounge Radio, Broke Down Ghetto Bomani Radio What the f***?
And no better example of that than tonight, episode number 42.
Do you get points if you can tell us where the beep came from?
They know, that's so easy.
I know one person that's going to get that in two seconds.
Yeah, tell us the answer and then we can tease you because you're a dork.
Yeah, that's what you win.
You're so stupid!
I didn't hear it, but I'm going to guess it's the Healing Vision Angelic Wings.
Wrong!
Wrong!
You're so stupid!
Stupid American!
It's easy, come on.
Orange Lounge Radio, Broke Down Ghetto Bomani Radio.
What the f***?
You couldn't hear it.
It's just a beat, why don't you just forget what you're doing?
Oh, you want to know what the... Oh, I thought the... Oh, I thought you were talking about the backbeat.
The QQQ music I thought you were talking about.
Oh, the beep.
Yeah, oh, the beep.
One more time.
What the f***?
Oh, he just got it.
I'm spinning uncontrollably.
I feel like Dr. Evil.
Alright.
What else do I want to talk about?
Oh yeah, I know.
We're going to do a cage match.
We're going to do a cage match?
Yeah, remember I said we've got to have a new computer.
Oh, well shit.
Okay, so we're going to do a cage match.
Loki agreed his song sucked, so we're throwing it out and we're starting new.
So we have a new cage match.
And in this week's cage match, I have to dig a little bit for Jamie's song.
And I haven't even picked one yet.
Do you remember what week we did it?
Don't you usually copy them to your hard drive?
Not anymore because that hard drive is full.
Let's just keep that one in there.
Talk about something.
Talk about sex or something.
I like bananas.
There was actually something about this one research group saying that bananas, as we know them, are going to be extinct in a few years.
Why?
Because we bleed them out.
Why?
Because they stick them up their vaginas.
Why?
It would be really interesting to throw them in.
Why?
Then they stick them up their ass.
Why?
Why?
I don't know, Rob, you tell us.
Why?
Say something.
Something.
Rap?
Okay.
I am here, and my name is Chaos.
Okay, I found Jamie's... I found the song that Jamie was trying to do, so let's get this show on the road.
This is Cage Match without Loki, version 2.5.
Tonight's Cage Match.
Last week in the cage match, the duck song won again, but fuck it, because Loki wants to pull it because it sucks.
So instead, we have new contenders tonight.
The first one being a song called... Well, Jamie, you ought to introduce this.
Born to Bone, the Sandbone Trio.
And what's it from?
From Guitar Man.
And why do you like it?
Because it's fucking rules.
Alright, here it is, first entry tonight, so we're going to do it on the cage match.
Born to be Bone.
Thanks for watching!
Yay, it's mariachi-rific.
I was born to be bone, the Sandbone Trio.
First song in tonight's Orange Lounge Cage Match.
What did you think of that one, Jamie?
Nine.
Why?
Because it's cool.
That's probably my favorite song on that whole soundtrack, so I'm going to give it a nine.
I like that song, but I think if it wins too many weeks in a row, I'm going to get sick of it really fast.
So, I'll give it a good score this week, but next week it gets a crappy score.
So this week it gets 8.5.
Ah, son of a bitch.
Uh-oh.
Oh, sorry, I just put in a CD that went to an extended CD.
And it's not going to let you read the track data either.
Oh shit, it won't, huh?
Nope.
Ah, son of a bitch.
Wait, I know another way.
I know a way around it, I think.
I'm trying to pick my cage match song, and we're kind of doing this live on air.
I kind of ran out.
I just changed my mind at the last minute about what I wanted to play.
So I ran out to get it.
I want to see if I can get this to go.
Okay.
Okay.
Give me just one second, and I'm going to get my... One!
One second!
Okay, here we go.
I think I got it, so I'm gonna make sure this broadcasts.
Okay, my pick.
She got my FU of the week last week, but this week I'm putting her in the cage match because, well, I don't think any song I put in stands a chance against Sandbone Trio, so why not lose big?
I'm gonna put in Madonna, and this is a brand new track from her new album, and it's not American Life, the lead single, because you guys are probably worn out on that by now, but it's another track, and to me, the track is actually a bit Beatmania-ish to me, which is kind of why I like it.
Um...
and because it kind of progresses and it's a little silly the lyrics are kind of silly but it's an interesting song I think you guys might like it it's called Mother and Father and this is going to be my cage match pick for tonight and hopefully it plays for you guys otherwise I'm going to have to change it so let's try it
There was a time I was happy in my life There was a time I believed I'd live forever There was a time that I prayed to Jesus Christ There was a time I had a mother, it was nice
I'm trying hard to dry my tears Yes, father, you know I'm not so free I got to give it up Find someone to love me I got to let it go
I got to give it up, find someone to rely on me I got to let it go, find someone that I can care for There was a time I was happy in my life
DarkSakura.com
Thank you for watching!
I would never meet another person, never turn my heart into a cage, a victim of a kind of rage I got to give it up, I got to give it up Find someone to light me up Find someone that I can care for I got to give it up, find someone
Thank you for watching!
That's it.
That's Mother and Father by Madonna.
So, let's get... The end sounds like you ate a burrito and farted.
Let's get reaction from the room on Mother and Father by Madonna.
She's done much better.
I give it a 7, maybe.
Brad?
Since I haven't heard really anything besides the single from the CD...
I like the single better than this, I guess I shouldn't compare it By itself, it's pretty good, but it's, yeah, she has it better, so I'd give it like a 5 or 6, probably 6 I like it, the reason why I picked this song, you know what, the more, now that I'm listening to it in the context of this program That really was a shitty Cage Max pick
Because it doesn't stand very well on its own.
It really goes with the rest of the album.
But I like that song in relation to the rest of it because it's very quirky.
It's got... I don't know.
It just sounds very old school Madonna to me.
I don't know.
If you let me pick my song, it's going to be way quirkier.
I don't know.
What do you think, Jamie?
Should we let Brad put a song in?
Or we just want to keep it at two?
What's the song, Brad?
Twelve.
Alright, fine.
Since nobody's going to vote for that one, I guess we have to give Sandbone Trio a little competition.
Let's see.
Oh, Jesus.
Alright, what's the song that you're putting in?
Is this an audio CD?
Yeah, it's audio, so pull up the trackers.
I need to see the trackers first.
Okay.
We're rolling...
This is the good one.
Take five.
DarkSakura.com
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
Thank you for watching!
I'm a chicken machine I'm a chicken machine
That was the Aquabats with Magic Chicken.
Jamie, what did you think of that?
I like Skaf.
I don't think that that would work as a cage match song.
As a song, it gets a 9.
As a cage match pick, it gets a 4.
Brad!
I have to agree.
I wasn't trying to make it compete with anything.
I love the song.
As a song, it gets a 10.
As a cage match, it gets a crap.
So I wasn't trying, you know, that was just kind of a fucked up thing.
But before we go on to you, I want to ask something.
What...
is a Cage Match song.
Is Cage Match just Beat Mania style stuff?
Trance, techno, dancey stuff?
Songs that you'd want to hear regularly on Orange Moms Radio.
That's what Cage... Okay, see, I had it all wrong.
Next time I'll make sure to get something good that you want to hear, like Eminem or something.
Slick motherfuckers.
Sorry, I'm kidding.
As for my opinions on the song...
11.
Best cage match pick ever.
No, my favorite part of that song is when he's ratting off the different chicken places.
It's not bad.
You know what?
It's very Guitar Freaks.
I can see it in Guitar Freaks.
Totally.
Yeah, whatever.
Whatever.
Seven.
Whatever.
Okay, so.
Your entries, your possible votes, and send those votes to Sky in the chat room right now.
You can vote for the Sandbone Trio with Born to be Bone.
Which is off a CD that's not in it.
Okay, you don't get clips of the songs tonight.
If you don't remember them, you suck.
So you get Born to be Boned from the Sandbone Trio, The Aquabats with Magic Chicken, or Madonna with Mother and Father.
And not Duck Toy.
And not Duck Toy.
If you vote for Duck Toy, you get kicked.
So, send me your votes in the chatroom right now of a private message to Sky.
Unless it's Sunday, because we're pre-taped this week.
So, if you know the super secret time that we're taping, send them right now.
If you're in the chatroom right now, I actually want to hold off just really fast.
I want to get one more news story out in the open before we go to a break.
Rob has a confession.
I have a confession to make.
I...
Am Homo Sapien.
Okay.
I don't know if you guys have heard about this yet, but have you ever been to those sites, Petition Online, like where you can sign petitions?
And no one really gives a fuck about them?
No one really cares?
Like they had a petition to save Frenchie on American Idol that got like 500,000 signatures?
It didn't do shit.
Well, somebody decided, well, maybe we can get petitions to work for once.
We're going to petition for Konami of Japan to release a new version of Beatmania 2DX to the consumer.
However, there's a catch to this petition.
And I'll read this.
This is a petition asking Konami for a new release of Beatmania 2DX, preferably 7th style, for the Japanese PlayStation 2 console.
For all fans who are looking forward to a new mix, please sign this petition as it will be sent directly to Konami of Japan.
Either KCEJ or Konami Toyo.
This is not a solo project and is part of a larger petition with major Japanese Bimani fansite.
Any comments you add will be translated into Japanese and sent along with your name to Konami.
That's kind of the catch.
Thank you for supporting this petition.
So, if you want to go sign this petition, I'll post the link in the chat room right now, and hopefully somebody will be kind enough to repaste it at this point in the show on Sunday when it rebroadcasts.
But the website for this petition...
is petitiononline.com slash new2dx, but that's the number 2, not ii, as you usually see it.
So it's petitiononline.com slash new2dx.
So you can go sign that petition, and right now, there's quite a few.
We've got 98 signatures on it so far, so not too bad.
So you can go sign that right now.
Maybe you'll be lucky 100.
Quick, get in there right now.
Okay, so that's what you can sign if you want to petition for 7th style.
What do you think of that, Jamie?
I'll sign it.
What can it hurt, right?
This will be five whole seconds of my life.
I can never get back.
So after the break, we're going to come back and... Yes, for 7th style.
After the break, we're going to come back and we're going to announce the cage match winner.
And we're going to club baby seals.
We're going to have hot monkey sex.
No, you can have hot monkey sex.
And then...
And then you'll wake up on an island with these shiny new necklaces.
I'll break something.
Sometimes I like to kick people in the nuts.
Actually, I know one.
Pull up my DeviantArt page.
I have clips on my DeviantArt page.
By the time I pull up your DeviantArt page, I'll have the music ready.
Bullshit.
Okay.
Alright, we're going to take a quick break.
We're going to play some more old school Beatmania stuff because, you know, it was so popular last time.
And since we're not going to have monkey sex, we'll start with Drunk Monkey instead.
We'll be back.
You're listening to Orange Launch Radio.
Thanks for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Don't you love me?
Don't you love me?
Don't you love me?
Don't you love me?
You're the city How can I win your heart?
In a moment of love, nothing will calm me down Did you really love me?
Daddy, hold me tight No more willow wings, I've got to make my move You were a dreamy romp, if you knew how I feel Baby, can't you see, to make you mine
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio Because Bongo demands it
Alright, so that's tonight's Big Cage Match winner.
Now we have an extra special treat for this evening.
As you may or may not know, sometimes on this station when we're bored, we'll do a fuck-off show.
So, Jamie did one of these the other night, last night, right?
Usually it's just me putting in a random comment and then playing five hours of music.
And since we don't have a whole lot else to talk about tonight, we thought we'd treat you with an hour clip of one of these fuck-off shows.
And it was fun, wasn't it, Jamie?
Yeah, the theme of my fuck-off last night was stupid laws.
Stupid laws.
So that's going to take you out the last hour of tonight's show, and then it's all done, you guys.
But before that, so that I can let you hear it.
Oh, we're going to do the outro of the show first and then go into that.
We'll not do the outro.
Don't worry about that.
Just do the fortune cookie.
I have something else funny that we can use as a normal fortune cookie.
Okay.
Go ahead and join in.
You need to hear this.
So this is it.
This is the normal fortune cookie for tonight.
Here we go.
Car theft is on the rocks.
In America, a car is stolen every 12 seconds.
What can you do to protect your car?
An expensive car alarm system won't protect your car from being stolen.
The club won't protect the valuables inside your car.
But a big black guy named Ben can.
Get away from the car, motherfucker.
For less than you'd pay for an expensive car alarm system, and even
You can get a big black guy named Ben to protect your automobile.
Get away from the car, motherf***er.
It's simple to use.
Just leave the big black guy named Ben in your car whenever you get out, and he does the rest.
Whenever anyone gets within six feet of your car, Ben simply gets out of the car and tells them... Get away from the car, motherf***er.
Listen to these testimonials from people who use a big black guy named Ben.
It's always nice to have someone to ride with, although he really doesn't say much, just... Get away from the car, motherfucker.
That's about it.
I didn't get a big black guy named Ben to chat with.
I got him to protect my car.
It's the best investment I've ever made.
My neighborhood isn't that great.
There have been a lot of car thefts.
I can't tell you how many times I've heard... Get away from the car, motherfucker!
Knowing that I've got a big black guy named Ben protecting my car lets me sleep better at night.
Call now, 1-800-1-BIG-GUY.
That's 1-800-1-B-I-G-G-U-Y.
And instead of hearing this... You'll hear this.
Get away from the car, motherfucker!
D...
Alright, so, that's it.
Good night, you guys.
Can't wait for the carameldansen.
We're going to the tape bit now, and so enjoy the next hour, and thanks for joining us on this very special edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
Final thought, Jamie?
You get to listen to how bad I sucked last night.
Final thought, Greg?
Coleslaw sucks.
Evan, final thought?
What is the sound of cheese in the morning?
Is it you?
or is it what you want to be?
And my final thought is PUSSY!
Goodnight.
Now, just to go ahead and say this again, we are recording for the Sunday show because both Rob and I will be off at Rocky, doing a Rocky show in Davis.
More details on that in a minute.
So if you're hearing me say all this crap right now and it's Sunday, I ain't here.
Anyway, I'm going to go ahead and get into some other stuff.
They're downstairs watching Futurama or playing Zelda or some crap.
So here's some music.
