1810	2690	Message for you, son!
3130	4410	Attention!
5011	8912	Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
10512	15554	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.
19219	22161	Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
22482	25684	Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
26244	28966	Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
29507	32409	Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
33189	33610	Just kidding.
33810	35411	Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.
35611	42796	In this episode... Hey, any balls down there?
42836	45798	That's the biggest bear you ever seen, Jingleberry.
45918	48000	What's your favorite scary movie?
49073	49633	Showgirls.
50554	51714	Absolutely frightful.
51954	52535	What's yours?
52775	55256	There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.
55316	56497	Don't torture yourself.
57197	58017	That's my job.
58117	59938	Now's the time our sprockets bend me dogs!
59998	63100	I'll get you, my pretty.
63300	64640	And your little dog, too.
65020	65941	I know Kung Fu.
66301	68682	I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
68962	70803	Why did they have to take the word gay?
72424	75065	No one expects a Spanish exposition!
75325	76086	It's Kendo.
79036	80817	DarkSakura Shut up!
81017	81697	Where's my gun?
81817	83737	This is my boomstick!
84238	86738	Sky Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!
87058	90840	Loki I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.
90860	93620	What kind of warped human being would find that funny?
93881	95301	Orange Lounge Radio
97620	101581	We are live, and this is episode number 40 for April the 13th of 2003.
101661	111585	You're tuned into the B-Money scene's most interesting radio station of all things B-Money.
112805	114866	My name is Rob Roberts, and you might know me as Sky.
115386	117347	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.
117407	119848	In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.
119888	121348	You know her better as DarkSakura.
121689	122549	You rappin' cool.
124065	127849	and in the back playing with our brand new mixing board, TEE.
128229	129991	Say hello to our tech master, Loki.
130491	132393	And just make sure it doesn't go into the yellow too much.
134015	137378	And also with us tonight... I think you'll be turning down Rob's channel a lot.
137959	138439	Hey now.
139300	141522	Are you saying that I have a voice that carries?
142803	145886	This is great because with this new mixing board you can still hear me.
146127	147288	Ewan, I'm all the way over here.
152398	152698	Awesome.
153699	156062	Uh, oh yes, say hello to Intern Zero.
157403	160486	Did you know the show is like over the hill now?
161327	161767	I know!
162688	164450	We're turning 40 tonight, we're over the hill.
164490	166432	You're like magical and stuff.
167252	168894	Does this mean we're going to have a mid-show crisis?
170135	172638	It was just after last week's breakdown mid-show.
173278	173559	Remember?
173879	176962	Oh my god, I feel old, I need to go to bed.
178160	181383	Remember how we almost had a big crisis mid-show last week?
181403	183485	Like a giant fight starting with zero?
183725	185467	It was so neat.
185787	188370	No, that was just going off on a stupid song.
188410	190592	But see, I am the mid-show crisis.
191413	192033	Have a good day.
193695	194856	Why are you so angry?
195437	195957	Why am I so angry?
195977	196818	You can't be angry.
196858	197839	That's Jamie's role.
198640	199761	I can be angry, but I can't do that.
201934	206858	I can't be angry, though, because I am actually happy today, which is new and different.
207618	209640	He just threw a penny at me.
210480	211101	A panty?
211181	211421	What?
211921	212382	Oh, a penny.
212402	212942	Oh, a penny.
212962	214403	I thought you said a panty.
214463	215624	I'm like, wow, that's erotic.
216064	219127	I won't need people to throw pennies at me anymore now that I got a damn job.
219827	222909	Ooh, we'll have to hear more about that when we come back from the first break.
224351	225892	Sounds like we have a lot to be thankful for this week.
225912	227933	We might have to get rid of the FUs and do a happy segment.
228454	229134	Fuck that.
229514	230275	Okay, fuck that.
231297	232358	I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.
233698	238982	Lots of people saying hello to Zero in the chat room, including Angel and the other folks here.
241063	245025	However, if you want to get in our chat room and say hello, it's easy.
245105	251589	Just go to www.callybomani.com, our friends over there, and click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.
251829	252510	It's just that simple.
253470	255732	Alright, we're going to start off this break with what, Jamie?
257901	259222	This isn't crap, I like this song.
259242	261623	No, we're gonna start it off with old shit.
262004	267847	Old shit, okay, so we're gonna hear some old Mamadi music, and we'll be back to talk about a lot of stuff.
267867	269548	There's a lot, a lot, a lot of stuff to talk about this week.
269609	277153	And by the way, tonight, you guys, get your friends on the station, because tonight we have Kyle Snyder's new single, live from March Madness.
278054	279215	I'm moist with anticipation.
279535	286940	It's a miracle I actually got him, I convinced him to sing it a second time, because he kept getting interrupted, and he's like, I'm not gonna do it anymore.
286960	287500	I'm not gonna do it anymore.
308366	325068	And bring my wagons around, Mug it out, To the man in the sky of the bridge, Mug it out, When nobody wants to feed anyone, And nobody's backing me, I wanna be with the bridge,
358400	359151	Thank you for watching!
389089	389989	Thank you for watching!
429457	430478	Thanks for watching!
482125	483326	Thank you for watching!
506389	507771	Music, Music, Music,
568405	569286	Thanks for watching!
604873	605953	Thanks for watching!
655256	663782	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.
663822	669726	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
671888	674029	Alright, we have to start tonight's show off.
674049	680073	This episode is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the letter G, just like March Madness was.
680093	681995	No, no, that's not it.
684013	686394	Yeah, March Madness was brought to you by the letter Sakura.
686674	690615	Hey, I've got this music... I've got this music playing for a reason.
690875	695377	I have to start tonight's show off with a quick Ask Orange Lounge segment, because we have a question for Loki, and this is important.
696337	696657	Okay.
696957	697197	Okay.
697297	702859	Japan Man wants to know, where in the hell he can get his hands on that new Schlagwerk remix you did that we debuted last week?
704079	705380	Um, nowhere right now.
705860	708121	But I'll put it up, I'll put it up later.
708201	708981	Well, where's it gonna be?
709241	710161	It's gonna be on my site.
710421	711822	Where is your site, for those that don't know?
713742	718664	www.willddrforfood.net slash leechfromloki Beautiful.
719685	721946	So that's where you can download this new Schlagwerk single.
721966	723647	Whenever Loki gets off his butt and puts it up.
724468	726349	Yeah.
732252	735354	Or you can get it from DarkSakura because she's got it too.
736601	738663	And you can beg one of us in chat and we'll give it to you.
738783	739283	I'm stingy.
739323	741345	Just not during the show because we're trying to do the show.
741365	742266	You have to offer me favors.
742286	743808	You have to buy me that hot rod toy.
744068	747691	Oh, well, I can do this later if it's not on my site.
747711	748111	Go for it.
748151	748652	I don't care.
748852	749172	You know what?
749192	753356	We totally neglected the sim update last week, so let's just start tonight with a sim update, shall we?
753616	756139	Well, I've got to hold this guy who goes...
756906	757326	What the hell is that?
757427	758288	Oh, he got food.
758748	759269	Not for me though.
759369	760930	Anyways, this guy is Shuey.
761131	763053	He's done a bunch of stuff.
763733	766476	Right now what he's been doing is like the DDR Game Boy stuff.
766496	770701	He has all the sim files for all the DDR Game Boy tracks.
771322	772163	So we've got those.
772563	774946	But we're going to swap our collections.
775106	775847	And this guy's got 4,000.
775907	776327	And I have 2,000.
779835	780115	Wow.
780435	781976	But he has, like, one of everything.
782737	785238	He collects, like, everything off the sites.
785359	791202	So, you know, whereas I might have, like, one good one for, you know, Schlagwerk, whatever.
791242	795445	He'll have every single one ever made for Schlagwerk, which, you know, obviously I don't want to do.
795505	796846	But, hey, it's cool, you know.
797166	800328	So we're going to be trading those, and that's awesome, and I can't wait to do that.
800828	803730	And then I finally got up all my...
805311	805972	I don't know.
805992	808974	Right now I'm averaging about one update a month, so that's about what we're going to have.
808994	810295	Aside from all that...
830971	831512	Let's see.
832232	835995	Definitely check out Bomani Sims because you can always get new files there.
836475	838897	Even though some of them are like rehashed old shit.
838937	842479	But, you know, a lot of new stuff, especially UtterDude.
842859	844540	He does some really awesome sim files.
844580	845781	He's like my number one now.
846682	848863	Only because Healing Vision doesn't do them fast enough.
849163	851265	But he'd be my number one, you know.
852306	855168	Oh, speaking of Healing Vision, I'm going to have... He's my first...
855948	863830	SimFileCreatorInterview, E, and so I've got that coming up along with all of his files, so that'll be later on.
864631	867572	And then, um, I don't know, just not too much going on.
868092	877055	There's, you know, what was it, Havoc got a hold of the Euromix 2 disc, so he's ripping the banners and stuff from that, so hopefully we'll have some clean banners for that.
877295	883537	And then, um, oh, just a bunch of minor stuff, not really anything new with, um, set me in no new releases or anything.
884397	884537	Um...
887392	891734	Yeah, Zero's Files are back up on Bomani Sims and that's pretty much it.
891914	892574	You know, not too much.
895295	895775	Alright.
899117	901257	So, happy 40th birthday everybody!
901858	902778	Yay!
903158	904298	We are 40 weeks old.
904378	914202	Actually, we're older than that because we did two pre-taped shows and a pre-empted week so we're actually somewhere around 43 or 44 years old but it's the 40th actual show, you guys.
915854	917736	Favorite memory from the past 40 episodes?
919718	920119	What do you think?
920179	921781	Favorite memory from the past 40 episodes?
922021	926305	Out of every single show we've done, what was the funniest or best memory that we did?
926666	927267	My debut.
927987	929149	Which was, do you remember what number that was?
929169	929149	32.
930770	933333	I don't remember shit.
936216	936717	You remember, Loki?
938211	940072	I'm thinking... This should be a list list some week.
940092	940633	We'll do that for 50.
941193	946396	I'm thinking because I want to say there was one night I had you guys laughing really hard.
946416	947717	I can't remember what it was.
948337	949978	It was one of the FUs of the week.
950539	951419	I just can't remember.
954621	957803	Anytime I have food because I'm hungry and I'm broke at the moment.
957903	959624	I haven't taken any money out from the bank.
960225	961886	So, I need food.
964687	967129	I would say episode probably...
968050	977395	either episode number 8, which was the one, it was a really early episode, we had DDR Mike and Jazz here, I remember that, because that's when we got into the whole discussion about Pantsless Rage and Three-Titted Emmy.
978055	978715	That's a classic.
979216	984838	And episode, I think it was 27, that was the one when Angel and Stressa, it was their first visit in town.
985218	988280	That was the night when I realized that Orange Lounge had taken over this house.
988580	990781	Because there were so damn many people here that night, you remember that?
991281	991862	It was crazy.
993523	994263	And I quit myself.
994283	996204	I don't remember shit.
998510	1001372	Some folks in the chat room say their favorite memory is all the porn talk.
1004674	1005814	I like when I had balls.
1006815	1007335	When was that?
1007776	1008276	I don't know.
1008716	1009837	Like the first time Jonas showed up.
1010077	1011338	Yeah, where's our balls?
1011438	1012859	Jonas was supposed to bring some for us.
1012899	1013699	We're still missing them.
1014700	1015760	You having trouble finding your balls?
1016301	1018322	Yeah, because I paid him $2 to go get them.
1019502	1021864	I hope he remembers to get food for me.
1022144	1025346	Sending brainwaves, brainwaves, brainwaves, brainwaves.
1028621	1029101	Where's what?
1029121	1029702	Video recorder.
1031123	1032004	Is that it on the ground?
1032244	1032644	Okay.
1032924	1033345	Actually, no.
1033485	1034125	Jonas left stuff here.
1034145	1037468	My favorite, like, thing was March Madness when I just went off.
1038149	1040450	I think it was so funny because I pissed people off.
1040670	1041231	I don't know why.
1042772	1048917	Well, then I guess we could say my favorite thing was, like, slowly becoming insane during Shaft.
1049357	1049998	Oh, yeah.
1050358	1051639	That was classic.
1051759	1053701	I'm sick and I don't care.
1053721	1055522	I want you to die.
1056263	1057043	I'm hungry.
1057344	1057504	Food.
1057524	1057744	Food.
1059765	1065389	If you enjoyed our coverage of Shaft and March Madness, we have B3 coming up.
1066189	1070112	Which, B3 is the weekend of the 17th, I want to say?
1070432	1071372	God, I hope I'm not wrong.
1071633	1073754	I'm not looking at a calendar, so forgive me if I'm messed up.
1073774	1074034	17th?
1074434	1074935	Isn't that right?
1075015	1075355	Of May?
1077163	1077864	I hope not.
1078064	1079125	Why, what's that?
1079666	1081148	Yeah, it's like right after E3.
1081168	1082669	It's like right after E3.
1082689	1083670	Is E3 the week before?
1083971	1088215	No, E3 is like Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and B3 is Saturday, Sunday.
1089377	1092580	Shit, I hope... Goddammit, I'm gonna miss Matrix!
1093381	1093802	No!
1094863	1095544	Can't have this!
1096647	1098268	So we'll see what happens.
1098288	1102931	We're trying to see who we have to blow to get B3 tickets, by the way.
1103251	1103371	E3.
1103651	1103951	I'm sorry.
1104211	1107333	We don't have to worry about B3 tickets, but if somebody there needs blown, whatever.
1107793	1110275	I'm sure people would like getting blown for free.
1112316	1115758	We're trying to get tickets to E3 really, really badly.
1122086	1123347	I was trying to make you practice.
1123828	1125869	Rob's trying to shove the microphone up my nose.
1126770	1129512	I don't have to really say anything because this thing picks up everything.
1129932	1132915	I'm holding the microphone across the room and it's blinking.
1134016	1134236	See?
1136618	1139800	Rob's taking volunteers of people he can practice blowing.
1140861	1141282	No!
1141422	1142002	For E3.
1142022	1145225	Not me.
1146366	1147446	That's why we have an intern.
1149608	1150249	Fuck you all.
1154678	1157080	I suppose we can talk about actual Bomani news tonight.
1160723	1162504	Alright, this is the one that's on everybody's mind.
1163645	1165406	You know we have to bring this up, you guys.
1166928	1169249	The big, big news that comes out this week.
1170010	1177436	Electronics Boutique, on their website, is now taking pre-orders for Dance Dance Revolution Xbox Mix.
1179031	1182716	This is Xbox, because you can't have an Xbox mix, because that just sounds stupid.
1184598	1187382	What do you think of this DDR Xbox mix?
1187542	1196294	Well, considering that it looks like it has characters again, obviously, so I'm wondering if they're going to try to port the DDR PC version over to the Xbox, which I would like.
1198460	1199280	I'll read this story.
1199320	1202321	This is the official story coming from GamingHorizon.com.
1203322	1209083	It was only a matter of time until we saw the popular Dance Dance Revolution franchise scatter onto other consoles besides the PlayStation.
1209543	1211224	DDR first started in the arcades.
1211744	1217826	Electronic Boutique's website informs visitors of an upcoming DDR game from Konami entitled Dance Dance Revolution Xbox.
1218746	1228794	The game is supposedly going to contain all new songs, exclusive tracks for North America, Xbox Live integration so gamers can download more songs, characters, and dance steps.
1228854	1229435	Characters!
1232208	1237494	New game modes are also going to be implemented in that have never been seen before in other DDR titles.
1238274	1246163	Unfortunately, Economy of America hasn't sent out an official press release yet concerning this recent news, but we can almost guarantee to see something during E3 in May.
1246323	1248125	Will we get stuck with another diet mode?
1248525	1252630	I think that this has as much validity to it as 2DX USA.
1254258	1255478	I don't know, it's got picture.
1255798	1257759	I can't, I mean, pictures are truth, right?
1258079	1259819	I mean, no one's ever faked a picture before.
1260159	1261800	Oh, wait.
1262000	1262740	I'm going to dissent.
1262900	1263500	I think it's true.
1264701	1265721	I really think this is true.
1266621	1270602	Because I just don't, I don't see Electronics Boutique having that big of balls.
1271822	1272983	Rob, did you fall on your head lately?
1274523	1274743	Sure.
1275754	1277615	You want to know what I think is absolutely stupid?
1278135	1280176	DDR, Dance Dance Revolution, Xbox.
1280196	1282097	They could have called it like DDRX or something.
1282137	1283177	So they call it Xbox.
1283478	1285639	As if it couldn't, as if, where's the imagination there?
1286019	1286939	It could be a working title.
1287219	1288980	Because it's only for the Xbox.
1289320	1290661	It's only for the Xbox.
1292068	1298931	And if you look at the box art, and I just posted a link in our chat room to this story, it says, only for Xbox.
1299131	1300791	But this is probably that fake art.
1300851	1308734	You know how sometimes the big gaming stores, GameStop, EB, and all those, they do like the fake box art when they're taking pre-orders?
1309154	1315137	I'm gonna go and draw just DDR Xbox and put it up on a site and say this is the official art.
1315517	1316037	First of all...
1317922	1321244	It's DDR on a non-PlayStation system.
1322024	1323605	And I loved my Dreamcast ones.
1323645	1324345	You know, they're great.
1324365	1327206	But you can't make edits and take them with you.
1327686	1328987	And you can't use paint mode.
1329027	1330688	I mean, you know, paint.
1331168	1332829	Paint was like the best thing about Third Mix.
1333029	1333349	Not really.
1335330	1338051	I think it's a big pile of stinky dog poo.
1340452	1343153	I guess we won't find out for sure until E3, but I don't know.
1344434	1346615	I think there's validity to it.
1346695	1346975	I just...
1348155	1348915	It makes sense.
1349736	1353998	Microsoft's really straggling right now to get something that's going to be successful for their system.
1354138	1361101	You get a really popular kind of growing thing like DDR, and there's going to be those obsessive freaks that will buy an Xbox just for this mix.
1361661	1362002	I won't.
1362422	1365323	I won't either, but there will be obsessive freaks that will.
1365543	1366084	Oh, I can't wait.
1366184	1366944	I can't wait.
1367544	1367884	I can't wait.
1368145	1368425	Oh, wait.
1368585	1369225	Oh, it sucks.
1371466	1373167	The Xbox is all about having Steel Battalion.
1374130	1379111	So as the one person in this room who actually owns an Xbox, Jamie, what games are worth playing on the Xbox?
1379752	1381872	The game of throwing the Xbox at children.
1383573	1384333	Jet Set Radio Future.
1384353	1385873	That's it.
1385893	1386734	DOA Beach Volleyball.
1387194	1387914	Boobie Ball.
1387934	1389094	I like the boobies.
1389114	1394956	There's nothing funnier than watching men decide trying to accessorize a swimsuit.
1395716	1398017	Fuck that, we're just trying to figure out how to take it off.
1400609	1404770	DOA 3 was good, because I am a fighting game whore.
1405130	1407671	Okay, but like, let's look at some of their new games.
1407691	1408931	Fable, I'm looking forward to.
1408951	1410212	Like Project Gotham Racing.
1410972	1411572	I'm looking forward to Fable.
1411632	1413073	If that wasn't a Midnight Club knockoff.
1414473	1427977	Fable is an RPG where you start off with him as a child, and you run through this character's life, and whatever decision that you make, like say you lose an eye, well after a while the people might start calling you Winky.
1429086	1429588	DarkSakura.com
1432927	1435529	What if you are without arms and legs?
1435669	1436770	What would they call you then?
1437010	1437491	Target.
1439692	1452663	But, like, they also have, like, if you, you know, kill, like, this whole family and leave, like, a child alive, the child can make it their life's quest to kill you, or they'll be afraid of you, or, you know, things like that.
1452803	1454204	It's, like, whatever decision that you make.
1454224	1459288	So can your priest character go and sexually molest other children and other families, and then they'll have issues later on in life?
1460129	1461410	Yes, it would work that way.
1462290	1463410	Okay, just checking.
1464591	1474093	I don't know, I think it would be kind of neat, although I don't really like, you know, it's sort of like the typical American looking art for RPGs and the like.
1474713	1476533	I don't really like how it looks.
1477213	1479874	But then again, I didn't like how Wind Waker looks in a sneak game.
1480154	1484555	Because, you know, Link looks, you know, deformed and semi-retarded.
1485736	1488877	Then again, it's not really Link, so it doesn't matter.
1491438	1492398	What game is this again?
1493059	1493479	Wind Waker.
1494279	1495399	No, the one before that.
1495459	1495839	Fable.
1496200	1496500	Fable.
1499161	1499841	Fable.
1502101	1505563	Japan Man, I think, said, what about Halo?
1507739	1509641	Halo's pretty, but it makes me throw up.
1509741	1510902	Halo sucks ass.
1511503	1512724	Halo sucks.
1512764	1513665	Because I say so.
1514426	1515547	Halo is not that bad.
1515727	1519111	It's good if you like a mindless adventure, shoot-em-up type.
1519311	1520452	Where's my Duke Nukem Forever?
1521113	1522314	Say hello to the Ice Queen, by the way.
1522394	1522854	Oh yeah, hi.
1524249	1533336	No, I'm sorry, but Halo was alright, but I thought it got real repetitive after a while, and Halo 2 is just going to be just as bad, probably, except you can play it online, supposedly, yes or no.
1533856	1537879	I want them to take the first Doom and make it look really cool.
1538520	1538780	Yes.
1539841	1540742	No, I don't want Doom 3.
1541162	1543183	I want the first Doom done really cool.
1544124	1545585	I want them to take Hexen.
1546706	1548167	Not Hexen 2, I want Hexen.
1549348	1550129	I want them to do...
1551002	1555523	A sprite-based first-person shooter collection.
1555543	1556343	Chex Quest.
1557063	1558824	Best damn serial game ever.
1559124	1561384	And I want it to work with the Steel Battalion controller.
1562044	1564725	Chex Quest.
1564745	1566005	He brought up Chex Quest.
1566085	1569446	And I want them to have level editors so I can play Gatchaman Quake.
1571986	1574647	They did a Gatchaman skin for Quake.
1575191	1580752	I'm trying to figure out how to make a forest level for Counter-Strike so I can have the whole Battle Royale theme.
1581132	1582873	I have four characters made out of 40.
1583813	1585013	There's white cream on my shirt.
1585793	1586494	No comment!
1587834	1593075	No, I'd like to see... All I'm waiting for is the return to Castle Wolfenstein on the PS2.
1593095	1595736	Eh, why play it on PS2?
1595996	1597316	Because I don't want to play it on the computer.
1597536	1599696	So it'll be... You can get all jaggedy edges!
1600517	1601517	And motion blur!
1603436	1606317	I like jaggedy edges in motion blur, I'll have you know.
1607938	1610038	You know, everybody hates motion blur because of the bouncer.
1610278	1611939	It was nothing but one big blur.
1613219	1614139	Orphan was worse.
1615020	1616000	Bouncer was stupid.
1616500	1618421	I wanted Orphan to be a good game.
1618461	1620021	I actually own it and have yet to play it.
1621042	1624743	I wanted... Well, Dan got it for me because I'm a big Orphan fan.
1624943	1625503	I love the anime.
1626201	1631246	I was wondering about that, because I've played Orphan, the video game, and it was alright.
1631426	1635611	I mean, it was... Well, I wouldn't say it completely sucked, just because I'm like...
1636795	1638236	I don't know, it was okay.
1638396	1640357	I slacked off on collecting the DVDs.
1640517	1641778	But is the DVD worth watching?
1641798	1642918	Oh god, the anime is awesome.
1642938	1643118	Really?
1643178	1643278	Okay.
1643498	1647120	Um, I've got like five Laserdiscs of the second series, Orphan Revenge.
1647200	1648001	How many series are there?
1648521	1648741	Two.
1649241	1650682	And then I think there was OAVs, I think.
1650902	1651802	Did they make the box sets?
1652443	1652623	Yes.
1653203	1653683	Yay!
1653763	1655204	Okay, now I have something to look forward to.
1655264	1661027	But, dude, well, Orphan's already, I think the whole series should be out now on DVD, but I've only got the first three.
1661567	1662848	I totally slacked off on it.
1662928	1663568	I love Orphan.
1664509	1664709	Cool.
1665925	1670169	I've played stuff from music from the series on one of my fuck-off shows before.
1675033	1676033	Welcome to Anime Chat.
1676093	1676354	Hi.
1676854	1678916	EOSFVB says, remember Commander Keen?
1679076	1680077	That game was the shit.
1682038	1685481	That was the best game, except there were like a million sequels and it got redundant.
1685681	1686762	Jazz the Jackrabbit.
1686802	1687323	No, I'm sorry.
1689044	1692187	Commander Keen 4 was like better than like Super Nintendo.
1692907	1693628	Leisure Suit Larry.
1695257	1696978	Anyway, back to DDR on Xbox.
1697179	1699140	Wait, it's all about the crystal caves.
1699861	1701802	Who in here remembers Phantasmagoria?
1703303	1703644	Okay.
1703664	1706266	A game I never got to play.
1707947	1712170	I know, I got to see the end of it, but Myst annoyed the hell out of me.
1712550	1713451	I have Myst on Saturn.
1714172	1717314	I think I still have the discs for Phantasmagoria around here somewhere.
1717334	1718355	I'm going to have to find them for you.
1722029	1724090	Everyone who has a Saturn, raise your hand.
1724510	1725771	We own you.
1725791	1726251	Whatever.
1728712	1731694	You'll have access to... I have two Saturns also.
1733294	1733775	One's modded.
1735635	1736756	I have two styles of Saturns.
1737696	1743939	The only reason why Jamie always says, everybody who has this, raise your hand, because she has everything.
1744319	1745360	She will always win.
1746374	1747215	I don't have a Jaguar.
1747935	1750837	You don't have a crappy Jaguar, good, save yourself.
1751737	1755739	I want a Jaguar for the version of Tempest 2000 on it.
1756120	1759281	Do you ever see Sean Baby's list of the 10 worst video games ever?
1759982	1760182	No.
1760262	1761963	Like, five of them are Jaguar games.
1763453	1766535	And then the others are the Zelda games on 3DO.
1767096	1769257	One of them was... It was the 3DO or CDI.
1769397	1772740	I think the worst game was, what, Gilligan's Island or something.
1773520	1773821	I don't know.
1773861	1774601	I'll pull up the list.
1775262	1777763	No, the worst one of the worst games ever is the version of E.T.
1777803	1778664	that's on the Atari 2600.
1778704	1779405	Yes, that's it.
1779465	1779945	That was it.
1780225	1780665	That was it.
1780746	1781326	It was the E.T.
1781386	1789572	on... Their whole little rumor is that there's like 2,300 cartridges buried out in like Mexico or something.
1789652	1790533	That is not a rumor.
1791673	1792274	It really isn't.
1792810	1795673	Return to the green planet, or blue planet, or whatever it sounds like.
1809409	1812010	How about Return to My Butt?
1812110	1813971	This is an interesting topic.
1814211	1817393	This is an interesting topic, so let's do this anyway.
1817433	1822035	This is Sean Baby's list of the 20 worst video games of all time.
1822095	1823995	I'm going to see if I own any of these.
1824716	1825876	Hold on, we'll go through these one at a time.
1827337	1831499	I'm posting a link to SeanBaby.com slash NES slash EGM dot HTM.
1831519	1832459	We're going to run through these right now.
1832479	1832459	20.
1834220	1837361	Extreme Sports with the Bearstein Bears for Game Boy Color.
1837741	1837882	No.
1839282	1840603	Oh my gosh, I remember that.
1840643	1844525	My little cousin had that, and I threw the Game Boy halfway across the room.
1844605	1846246	That was the worst thing ever.
1849079	1852681	Number 19 is Bible Adventures for the NES.
1853041	1857683	Actually, in storage in Alabama, I do indeed own this game because I stole it.
1857923	1871710	I was just reading something in the back of the official PlayStation magazine, or I think it was PlayStation, or it was EGM, and they were talking about the Legend of Zelda that they converted into a Bible story.
1872010	1873671	You didn't have a sword, you threw fruit.
1874531	1876192	And you're on this whole spiritual journey.
1876632	1876993	No.
1877133	1887218	There's a hack rom of the Zelda game on the Game Boy, the old Game Boy one, where he has a penis for a sword and goes around, you know, like Dildo Man or something.
1888832	1897837	Now, do remember that this article is probably about four years old that we're looking at, so I don't think it includes anything for GameCube, PlayStation 2, anything like that.
1897857	1898398	So next one.
1898698	1901559	Next one is, now this is great, and I think Jamie owns this.
1901840	1904441	I do indeed own Criss Cross Make My Video.
1905041	1906742	And you were there when I bought it.
1906762	1907603	I was there when she bought it.
1907963	1909564	I bought a brand new copy.
1909864	1910905	Toy Liquidators for $4.
1910945	1913286	Wait, I thought that was the Marky Mark one I watched you buy.
1913766	1915668	No, that was the Marky Mark one, but I do own the Criss Cross one.
1915688	1915968	Okay.
1915988	1916168	Okay.
1917884	1919465	We need to play that on the show.
1919545	1920626	Yeah, you gotta bring that in.
1920666	1925371	I think I actually ended up giving the crisscross one to Dan's friend Eric, but... Get it back.
1925491	1926612	He was way off in me.
1926932	1935659	We need to instate, like, Orange Lounge Extreme Challenge and have, like, you know, part of it to make the coolest video for, like... These are things we need to bring to B3.
1937125	1942287	We need to go and buy all these games and see who can stand to play them.
1942347	1943387	I'll bring the Marky Mark one.
1943487	1945087	I'll bring my CDX and the Marky Mark one.
1945187	1945788	Oh, God.
1946788	1949849	Number 17, Bubsy 3D for the PlayStation.
1950769	1952570	As if Bubsy 1 wasn't crap enough.
1952650	1952810	No.
1952870	1953930	Anyone ever play Bubsy?
1954350	1955150	I played Bubsy.
1955190	1955791	I played Bubsy.
1955931	1956911	And Bubsy 2.
1957471	1958872	Holy shit.
1959112	1960252	That was a fun game.
1961579	1964201	Number 16 is Bad Street Brawler for the NES.
1964641	1967283	That game was shit.
1967444	1974289	The only game I can think of that was worse than Bad Street Brawler, and it's not on this list so I can say it, was that fucking Bayou Billy.
1974549	1975830	I did not like that game at all.
1979562	1981803	Number 15 is Total Recall for the NES.
1982003	1982863	I used to have that game.
1983943	1985004	I threw it down the stairs.
1985744	1988705	Have a picture of the three-titted chick here on SeanBaby's site.
1989745	1990845	I'll tell you the worst one.
1991105	1991405	Hold on.
1991665	1992186	Is it on there?
1992606	1994106	We're going to go through one.
1994146	1995166	No, I know before I say it.
1995546	1996047	Okay, no.
1996147	2000708	The worst Arnold Schwarzenegger-based game was Predator on the NES.
2000768	2001668	I don't remember Predator.
2001808	2003049	Oh, it was bad.
2003229	2004869	You couldn't even jump when you needed to.
2005069	2006249	He'd, like, jump on his own.
2007150	2008010	Do everything on his own.
2008030	2008250	Oh, my God.
2009311	2017764	Number 14, Rap Jam, Volume 1 You could play Queen Latifah vs. Coolio
2018934	2020455	all in a big game of basketball.
2020676	2021937	Dude, I'd play as Queen Latifah.
2021957	2022577	That's cool.
2022597	2027461	And they say, it says here on Sean Baby's site, Queen Latifah looks like a 130-pound Mexican boy.
2027481	2030444	Alright, next.
2030624	2033106	Number 13 was Air Cars for the Jaguar.
2034006	2034387	Um, no.
2034527	2035468	Looks like a piece of poo.
2035788	2038210	Number 12, I think Jamie owns this, Night Trap.
2038450	2038810	Yes.
2040111	2042093	I want the 32X one.
2043554	2045716	Night Trap starring drug-induced Dana Plato.
2045776	2046637	Dude, Night Trap is neat.
2047262	2049183	Star Trap, I'm sorry, Night Trap was neat.
2049243	2053025	Night Trap was good, it was like the first real controversial game out there.
2053346	2064112	Night Trap required intelligence to play it, because you had to know what, you monitor your things and everything, but we've actually, you can download an FAQ that tells you when to watch each camera.
2064812	2066993	I want a new version of Maniac Mansion.
2067234	2067634	Yes!
2068294	2069895	It says, I always made the house explode.
2069915	2071376	Didn't they have a Maniac Mansion cartoon?
2072318	2072998	That was a TV show.
2073119	2074679	That was a TV, yeah, live action TV show.
2074740	2075340	On the family.
2075420	2077901	I have, I have the data tentacle and that was funny.
2077921	2080343	Monster in my pocket.
2081143	2081223	Yes.
2081244	2083605	Monster in my pocket before there was Pokemon.
2083725	2087107	Okay, we're going down Sean Baby's list of the 20 worst games of all time.
2087127	2087227	No!
2087287	2089989	It's a couple years old.
2090449	2091650	It's Dragonlance.
2091750	2094952	Number 11 is Dragonlance, Heroes of the Lance.
2095913	2096833	I want that game.
2096893	2098254	I don't even remember this game.
2098274	2099435	Because I love the books.
2099915	2101176	I don't care if the game sucks.
2102593	2105174	It sucks, it makes a complete mockery of the books.
2105294	2109035	I had one of the Dragonlance PC games that came on, the big-ass floppy disks.
2109475	2112696	I've never seen the PC version, I've only seen that version and that, no.
2114336	2115537	Yeah, because I read all the Dragonlance games.
2115597	2123759	Okay, this one I absolutely agree with, because the home versions, even down to the Saturn version, sucked so much ass, Revolution X.
2124548	2126348	Aerosmith, Stars in Revolution X
2148534	2152760	I gotta say though, the Super NES version was better than the PC version.
2153261	2154662	The PC version was worse.
2158462	2159123	Number 9.
2160344	2161284	Jamie, do you have this one?
2161324	2162285	Custer's Revenge.
2162805	2163666	I have ROM of this.
2163686	2165227	Dan has ROM of this.
2165247	2168410	Yeah, I think a lot of people have the ROM, but nobody has the actual cartridge that we know.
2168430	2176616	Come to think of it, I may actually have, we have a ROM chip player for 2600, and I think we actually may have the ROM chip for this.
2176836	2181700	Now, for those that don't know what Custer's Revenge is, the way it works is you play Custer.
2181800	2183061	You can fuck a skull.
2183181	2187344	Your job is to fuck this woman with a feather in her hat.
2188525	2189485	Um, over and over again.
2189505	2190426	That's a dildo on her head.
2190846	2192207	Or it's a dildo on her head, I don't know.
2192227	2192787	I like that caption.
2192807	2194287	And you have to dodge the falling arrows.
2194528	2195288	I like the caption.
2195468	2198409	It says, erotic imagery, I've masturbated to sexier Legos.
2201210	2201530	Okay.
2201590	2203011	Dude, X-Man is not on this.
2203700	2204321	What's X-Man?
2205021	2211308	X-Man was this one where you play as this little, he looks like scissors except it's a guy with a big dick the size of his body.
2212029	2218916	And you walk through a maze and then when you get to the center of the maze and avoid the traps, you like have to, there's this woman on all fours and you have to bone her.
2221624	2224566	Number 8, White Men Can't Jump for the Jaguar.
2224746	2225386	God, no.
2226767	2227767	Whoop, there it is.
2229548	2230349	I hate that game.
2230409	2235131	I haven't played it because I got flack for my last name because of that stupid movie.
2236152	2236892	God damn it.
2239054	2241015	Number 7, Superman 64.
2241575	2243736	Played it, never got it.
2244377	2245597	It had potential to be cool.
2246978	2248299	Dude, that looks like Star Fox level, though.
2249339	2250320	Yeah, it looks like Star Fox.
2251261	2254183	Number six, Zelda, The Wand of Gamelon.
2254323	2254943	CDI!
2255083	2263609	This was the one that they made for the CDI, where if you thought Link looked like shit in Wind Waker, you have not seen a shitty cartoon Link.
2264589	2267471	No, I just want to know who got fired for this.
2268412	2270133	Zelda looks rather wanton right there.
2270173	2271714	Look at her expression with her mouth open.
2273915	2277217	It looks like Princess Zelda in this picture is about to give somebody head.
2278138	2279999	It's the designs from the cartoon series.
2280740	2282982	Oh, yeah, it's so good.
2283002	2285363	Well, excuse me, princess.
2285704	2287545	Why is Link being played by Prince?
2289626	2290487	That's all I want to know.
2291408	2293009	All right, number five.
2293029	2293889	He's not Link anymore.
2293949	2295630	He's like an ocarina.
2295670	2296731	It's like what his symbol is.
2296831	2298993	A game for the 3DO called Virtuoso.
2299033	2299413	Virtuoso.
2299533	2300354	Oh, my God, no.
2301114	2303936	Being played by... Oh, shit.
2304036	2305517	Oh, man, I don't know.
2309205	2310626	I don't think it says who did it.
2311486	2312467	I guess it was nobody famous.
2313708	2316650	Number four is a game called Captain Novolin.
2317111	2317411	No.
2317731	2318032	What was it on?
2318052	2320614	Which is, it's a game about diabetes.
2323836	2328220	It was put together not to educate children about diabetes, but to blatantly taunt their disease.
2331087	2334468	Okay, I've played better flash games than what this looks like.
2334488	2344170	There's this flash game about sexually transmitted diseases, and you have to catch the jizz in a condom.
2345770	2347371	It's a flash game.
2347651	2353472	This helpful nurse will come out and say, you need to check your blood sugar four times a day, but you can check it more often if you like.
2354386	2355067	That's a helpful point.
2355087	2356750	I don't want to stick a needle in my finger.
2357210	2358673	Here, let me do it 20 times a day.
2359474	2359594	No.
2359834	2362398	Diabetes is nothing to joke about, but that's why this game is so bad.
2362499	2364782	I know it's not, but still, it's rather wrong.
2364822	2365924	That's why this game is bad.
2367421	2368461	Fight4Life Fight4Life Fight4Life
2398792	2400032	I own this game and it's... Awesome, man!
2428151	2432574	Freakin' awesome, he just made the eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, the whole game.
2434176	2439420	Although I would actually... I'm gonna make a t-shirt with the E.T.
2439460	2443043	sprite and a big anti-thing.
2443983	2445204	Don't be dogging E.T.
2445224	2448147	I want a shirt with the dragon on it.
2448307	2451609	We should open up an Orange Lounge store that sells these things.
2451989	2453751	One of those crappy cafe e-press stores.
2457853	2458153	All right.
2458954	2469579	I think what we're going to do at this point, did everybody get off their chest what they wanted to say about DDR on the Xbox and all?
2469919	2471019	I think they picked up on the mic.
2472960	2473881	A quick question for you guys.
2473901	2478643	We're getting asked by the chat room about this, and I said yes, because I know at least I'll be here.
2479043	2480204	Next Sunday is Easter.
2480424	2481404	Are we still doing a show?
2481764	2482164	Hell yeah.
2482184	2483505	I don't do anything for Easter.
2483685	2485246	Does anybody have to celebrate Easter?
2486269	2487509	Only if I get to burn something.
2489770	2490930	Easter's really about the eggs.
2490970	2492751	Who gives a crap about this Jesus shit?
2492771	2495372	We're not going to be celebrating Easter.
2495392	2496892	We're going to celebrate my birthday.
2497832	2498133	Huh?
2498613	2499513	That's right, you guys.
2499613	2501073	Next Sunday is Jamie's birthday.
2501093	2504134	It's not the day after my birthday.
2504214	2504594	Oh, that's right.
2504614	2505255	Today's the 13th.
2505295	2505615	Never mind.
2505895	2506195	That's right.
2507035	2508015	But that means next week is 420!
2508055	2508476	Whoop-a-dee-doo.
2514327	2514947	Good for you.
2515067	2515988	Are you a pothead?
2519588	2520809	I know someone who is.
2522489	2525930	Anyway, yeah, we'll be here next week.
2526410	2528351	Oh, where did 420 come from?
2528791	2529571	420 is the police code.
2529591	2531712	You know how there's all these police codes for different crimes?
2532492	2534092	420 is smoking marijuana.
2534112	2534512	I've got a 1337.
2535093	2538573	I wonder what a 1337 is in police code.
2539394	2540594	I call a homestar run or break.
2541710	2542311	A Homestar Runner, right?
2543193	2544235	You want to do a Homestar Runner, right?
2544476	2545999	Did you bring some on your CD here?
2551494	2552615	And now, more sounds of E.T.
2553776	2555337	In two weeks, however, we'll be taped.
2558340	2559801	Why are you sending me to Homestar Runner?
2577035	2578396	Uh, okay.
2579698	2580839	I have no idea what Jamie's doing.
2580859	2583581	She just took over my computer and she's loading up stuff on the Star Runner.
2584041	2587204	On my computer, I have it loaded to where it'll start up.
2587244	2589987	It'll say, Hello, stupid, and welcome to your crappy computer.
2591268	2591848	I want that.
2592629	2594871	I can send you the MP3 if you really want it.
2595031	2595451	Cool.
2595932	2598174	It's from, it's Strong Bad saying it, so it's pretty cool.
2601717	2601837	Um.
2602397	2602758	Oh, dear.
2602778	2602818	Oh.
2617803	2620105	Why don't you and the Chief pull a caper of some sort?
2620506	2623808	It seems like there's been little cooperation between the two of you as of late.
2624209	2625630	James, Detroit me.
2626651	2627431	Well, you're right.
2628172	2634057	And it's no secret that the Chief and I haven't been getting along very well since he screwed up our last caper.
2634997	2636539	I don't care about the crosswords, man.
2636579	2637960	Just the jumbles, the jumbles.
2639342	2640483	I don't know, go look over there!
2642203	2642604	Look out!
2643204	2644084	Oh, great, man!
2646845	2652147	He's too upset, Batman.
2652968	2654188	What are you guys doing in my house?
2654528	2655329	We've been ID'd!
2655649	2656589	Every man for himself!
2658410	2659951	Thanks for stopping by, you guys.
2661351	2662832	Thanks for breaking my cowlamp.
2664152	2665033	The Chief, man.
2666913	2668014	Where did we go wrong?
2670069	2673550	Seems like just yesterday we were setting fire to Strong Sad's underwears.
2673730	2674370	How was yesterday?
2674390	2675211	This one's for you.
2676291	2682753	I got mad at the cheat for screwing up the jumbled paper.
2686054	2691876	I hope I don't see his name in the paper in the obituaries.
2692496	2696338	His dad would mean he's dead if he is not dead.
2698084	2724673	I'm so glad the cheetah's not dead, the cheetah's not dead Oh, I'm so glad the cheetah's not dead, the cheetah's not dead So glad the cheetah's not dead Just the claps, just the claps Wrong time, I didn't know you had any rhythm Oh sure, I got tons of rhythm You got the clap Keep it rollin' for me guys, keep it rollin'
2729173	2731456	DJ, I just wanted to say that.
2732136	2734018	Oh, I can't stay mad at you.
2735680	2737882	Oh, how about a little kick for old time's sake?
2738203	2740625	And I'll have your skin, man.
2741626	2742007	What's that?
2742087	2743228	Oh, what are we now?
2743328	2745470	I had you there.
2754543	2754943	Wow.
2757064	2763706	Okay, so, uh, yeah, that was, that was HomestarRunner.com, and I'm still convinced they're gonna sell out to the car- You guys are so cute.
2765446	2767507	Uh- I could probably get dressed or something.
2767967	2770007	What is it, like, three in the afternoon?
2771008	2772528	Looking good, Homestar.
2773268	2774128	Yeah, what's the deal?
2774489	2775709	I didn't know you had to shave.
2776189	2776769	Oh, I don't.
2777369	2777950	It's cinnamon.
2781571	2781831	Wow.
2782351	2783051	Okay, um-
2787108	2788068	Anyway, yes, hi.
2789689	2794471	Strong Bad, I still say that they're going to sell out to Cartoon Network within a matter of months.
2794752	2795332	I'll bet you anything.
2798653	2800294	We are now going to take a break.
2800874	2802975	Well, that was kind of a break, but we're going to take a real break here.
2803195	2808058	And you guys, I know you've been anticipating this for a long, long time.
2808898	2812880	Two weeks ago, during March Madness, we had the world debut of...
2813775	2817318	of Kyle Snyder's song, I Could Never Be Japanese.
2817378	2820000	And you guys, tonight, here it is again.
2820020	2821601	I will take this as an opportunity to go poop.
2824203	2826645	So, this is it.
2826765	2827206	This is it.
2827246	2828046	The world premiere.
2828147	2831329	Well, the second premiere, I guess, because we already did this once.
2831349	2831869	We're going to do it again.
2832410	2839836	This is a clip from March Madness of Kyle Snyder singing his new song, I Could Never Be Japanese.
2840596	2841157	Enjoy, you guys.
2842947	2871016	I remember when I was young It would come every Saturday evening I would watch some Japanese TV It never did get boring It was all I cared about There was nothing else for me to do Then I suddenly hit reality And a message came through
2872273	2897462	I could never be Japanese No matter what it would never be Even though I never gave up hope I had to face reality I thought it would all end there But somehow I kept going on I'm so interested in Japanese culture
2898210	2922804	That is why I wrote this song If it weren't for my brother I wouldn't know much about your culture I would be so ignorant It would be pure torture I'm sure there are others
2923479	2951862	Who are into Japanese culture too I'm glad I'm not the only one Otherwise I'd probably be a fool I could never be Japanese No matter what it would never be Even though I never gave up hope I had to face reality I thought it would all end there
2952631	2980570	Yet somehow I kept going on I'm so interested in Japanese culture That is why I wrote this song There was much I didn't know That I learned as the time flew by I was shocked about what I learned I didn't know why
2981468	3008579	Then it started to come to me Why I wasn't born in Japan Life would be too hard for me It must be part of the Lord's plan I could never be Japanese No matter what, it would never be Even though I never gave up hope I had to face reality
3009838	3037298	I thought it would all end there But somehow I kept going on I'm so interested in Japanese culture And that is why I wrote this song I could never be Japanese No matter what it would never be Even though I never gave up hope
3038035	3060712	I had to face reality I thought it would all end there Yet somehow I kept going on I'm still interested in Japanese culture And that is why I wrote this song
3097908	3099009	This is fucked up!
3099029	3099610	This is fucked up!
3234071	3243053	And now it's time for Erotic Pop Idol, where we will find the next singer for everyone's favorite perverse Bomani band, Erotic.
3243473	3244393	Do it all night.
3244634	3245514	Do it with me.
3245954	3247394	No, no, that was awful.
3247474	3248334	Bloody terrible.
3248394	3249735	Do you take vocal lessons?
3249815	3250795	Kill your teacher.
3251275	3252295	In the heat of the night.
3252755	3254856	Oh, God, I think my ears are bleeding.
3256036	3256696	I liked it.
3257216	3258757	Shut the bloody hell up, Paula.
3258877	3259297	Next.
3262412	3264154	Um, that was cool.
3264994	3266776	Do you even know why you're here?
3266856	3268558	That was just bloody pathetic.
3268618	3269099	Next!
3272042	3273484	Come on, do it with me.
3274465	3275706	Yes, yes, that's it!
3276066	3277228	We have a winner!
3278029	3281893	A Star is Born here on Orange Lounge Radio.
3283010	3285472	A star is born on Orange Lounge Radio
3305436	3309437	He was sitting there, like, staring at me while I was singing, and I'm trying not to laugh.
3309497	3311097	My face is absolutely bright red.
3311658	3312258	And he walks away.
3312278	3314798	I dropped the microphone and bursted into laughter.
3316259	3316919	It was so bad.
3317039	3318679	That's why he got interrupted the first time.
3320420	3321000	All right.
3322160	3325381	The studio's just erupted into chaos because we just had arriving.
3325401	3326641	We have Dark Childs in the house.
3326681	3327021	Yay.
3327441	3329222	D-Child in the heezy-fush-heezy.
3329935	3331276	DarkSakura will fuck you up, Mixx
3360317	3362379	Everybody should fuck someone up for that last song.
3362439	3368783	Also, Gamlande Couple, which we're finally starting to get... We're starting to get some feedback in the chatroom that, you know what, you guys?
3369304	3370765	Maybe that's overplayed a little bit.
3370925	3371585	You think so?
3371605	3373847	You think that song's overplayed or what?
3374207	3374508	Yes.
3375688	3377490	It's back all over again, everybody.
3378504	3380625	I have never, ever had one of these before.
3380645	3380965	What do I do?
3380985	3381885	Do I push the marble in?
3382405	3382625	No.
3383586	3385126	Did you take the plastic off?
3385506	3386446	I took the plastic thing off.
3386646	3388047	Well, there should be a green thing in there.
3388547	3388667	Oh.
3388887	3398590	Yeah, well, now it's not, but... Love the lovely stuff of Orange Lodge.
3398610	3399530	Oh, I'm getting a lesson.
3399710	3400811	You take your thingy off.
3402651	3403211	Yeah.
3403251	3403371	Cool!
3408413	3413034	Yeah, it's... They do... No, I don't want to see that!
3414774	3415014	What?
3415094	3417535	I haven't followed it for a season.
3417575	3418295	What is this?
3419155	3421215	Everybody use your imagination at home.
3421295	3422415	I stuck it in my mouth.
3422535	3425476	Or better not, don't use your imagination at home.
3427496	3429197	Rob just didn't want to get it on the floor.
3432317	3433757	You know I just had to lick that all up.
3435478	3437178	Better to let it shoot off in your mouth, right?
3439406	3440046	No, oh my god.
3440687	3445950	My friend Garrett, earlier this week, he took me to... What's that Japanese store?
3445990	3446551	It's in South Side.
3446611	3447571	Ototo's, I think it's called?
3449844	3450985	I think that's what the place was called.
3451125	3455987	It's over on... And I apologize for those out of Sacramento who aren't going to get this.
3456367	3459929	It's on Fruit Ridge and... Fruit Ridge and what's the other after?
3459949	3460349	Freeport.
3460569	3461290	Freeport and Fruit Ridge.
3461310	3463391	Okay, that's like a mile away from my house.
3463511	3467773	Okay, they have... If you're not in a car, don't go throughout the area.
3467813	3468333	You will die.
3469134	3469514	I am done.
3471055	3474676	We went and we got that and... There was a reason I was telling this story.
3474736	3477818	Oh yes, he bought the explosive Hello Kitty drink.
3478698	3485400	and it's this drink and it has Hello Kitty on it and it tastes like, it tastes like, you remember those fruit candies Mamba from high school?
3487140	3488000	Mamba candies.
3488341	3490761	It tastes like a liquid version of Mamba candies.
3492081	3495862	But when you open it, it opens worse than a bottle of champagne.
3495882	3496723	He has to point it away.
3497083	3502624	We opened it in his backyard and when you open it, the plastic top flew 40 yards and he didn't even shake it.
3503164	3504845	So that's why we call it the explosive Hello Kitty drink.
3504865	3505545	You should shake it.
3507594	3508294	Yo, what's this?
3508515	3509195	Pointing at the bird.
3511276	3512657	Shake it and take it to RVGL.
3514078	3514198	Oh!
3514658	3515178	Oh my god!
3515438	3515999	That's a great idea.
3516179	3518760	Who wants to take exploding Hello Kitty drink to RVGL?
3519821	3522783	We can like shake it up like... First of all, who wants to go to RVGL?
3522903	3523463	Cricket noise.
3523503	3526945	You can hurt the kids in RVGL.
3529546	3532228	I do so I can kick the crap out of some stupid little raver kids.
3533971	3534271	I'm eating.
3562543	3563943	And you know, we kind of got on a tangent.
3564344	3565584	We were talking about Bomani news.
3565604	3566924	We had tons of it to cover.
3567484	3569045	And then I got a cool little back.
3569385	3570425	Everybody!
3571065	3572366	Everybody!
3575827	3578428	What do you want to talk about now, then?
3578488	3579908	There's still plenty of Bomani news to talk about.
3579928	3580788	You want to talk about something new?
3581868	3582289	Sure.
3582369	3584249	Let's talk about DDR Ultramix.
3584529	3585329	I was about to say that.
3585349	3586830	That is the stupidest idea in the world.
3586950	3587230	Why?
3588690	3590011	It's DDR PC 2.
3593903	3595024	It's ultra crap!
3595744	3600226	I mean, ooh, what, are we going to have more lovely characters that we're all going to drool all over?
3600927	3601207	No.
3603088	3605309	Trojan Man is the first unlock, just so you know.
3606369	3607990	This is being leaked, by the way.
3608090	3612232	Somebody had discovered this on the ratings board website.
3612972	3615414	There was this website, you know, that you go to to get the ratings.
3615434	3619055	How sad is it that people browse that site to look for new games that are coming out?
3619896	3620256	It worked.
3624088	3632076	This is something I brought up in the chatroom a few nights ago when I mentioned this for no apparent reason.
3632997	3641987	It's like, probably about 85-90% of the Bimani community, probably worldwide, knows about Stepmania or knows about DWI.
3642831	3653213	So it's like, why waste however much they're going to try to charge you for this stupid-ass game and just go spend a few hours a day downloading a bunch of songs and you'll be just fine?
3653293	3655534	Or do you really want the most retarded characters in the world?
3656614	3661835	Because it's all about the kick-ass characters and the possibility that there might be new stuff even though there will never be new stuff.
3664296	3666496	Now Jazz in the chatroom makes a good point.
3666937	3668457	You can't judge it till you play it.
3670075	3670735	Oh, okay.
3671275	3671876	Sure.
3672436	3673836	I'm going by track record here.
3673856	3675537	Well, I don't know.
3676157	3680678	If I'm correct, I've heard that from plenty of people before DDRPC came out.
3680938	3685200	You know, oh, you can't judge me before you play it, and then you play it, and they get mad at you for judging it.
3686520	3687700	It sucked, and they all sucked.
3691802	3693542	Wow.
3693662	3694102	All right.
3694323	3697804	I heard that about anal sex one time, but I'm not going to try it.
3697844	3699044	I'll judge it before I try it.
3699946	3707032	That... Well, you know, we were doing really good with this show, not going any type of porno way, and now all of a sudden, anal sex, pop!
3709034	3711056	Exactly, you couldn't have summed it up better.
3711076	3712237	Anal sex, pop.
3715900	3716461	Okay.
3716521	3718463	That's actually what Kyle Snyder songs sound like.
3718983	3723867	Does anybody else want to... I think people would have preferred anal sex over that Kyle Snyder song, seriously.
3731377	3733518	What new characters can we look forward to?
3733838	3736780	What wonderful ideas will Konami of America come out with?
3737900	3740222	There's a listless topic.
3741222	3742403	Will we get another paranoia?
3746246	3746406	Nope.
3747608	3748970	Dude, I'm so tired of Paranoia.
3749170	3750972	If I hear one more Paranoia, I'm gonna punch someone.
3751393	3752995	You know, I didn't think Paranoia was Survivor, was I?
3753015	3755598	Paranoia... That was the only, like, good one.
3755779	3756920	That and Evolution.
3757561	3761266	Wow, Paranoia's Survivor Max was so original, too, with its extra few seconds fed up.
3764385	3774627	Okay, as far as I'm concerned, Paranoia needs to die, Naoki needs to die, and... Well, no, if he died, then there would be no songs for DDR, because he's every artist.
3774767	3775387	Fuck that, man!
3775427	3776868	Get Good Cool to do all the music!
3776888	3777728	That would kick ass!
3777748	3779848	We need Good Cool and Tack to do all the music.
3780508	3781148	And Taka, too.
3784289	3784989	Fuck Naoki.
3786770	3789230	Naoki needs to go back and do more Gradius music.
3792131	3792991	Akira Yamaoka.
3794907	3797368	Yeah, we need more Yamaoka songs.
3797888	3803811	But seriously though, what they need to do... Didn't it seem like everything with DDR Extreme was just being lazy?
3804391	3810274	Like they're lazy on the whole unlock system, they're lazy on the songs that they put in there, they're lazy on the soundtrack that they released.
3810934	3819183	It's just the whole thing is like, you know, I could have made this a good game, but, you know, I just kind of want to sit down and sleep.
3819743	3826450	There's something more fascinating than DDR, whatever that crap is, Ultimate Battle 22.
3826490	3827291	We went too extreme.
3829728	3831749	Me eating Pocky is more amusing.
3832029	3833670	Go the record, Rob did something phallic.
3850771	3851572	He still is!
3853193	3853954	This is wrong.
3854915	3860700	But yeah, it's just, they're gonna do it because they know people are gonna play it anyway because it's the next new thing that's retarded.
3861540	3863062	And that's how you lose your fanbase.
3863922	3864383	Right there.
3865083	3867065	You might wanna stop and get a little turned on over here.
3869227	3871909	Yes, you lose your fanbase just about as well as Metallica did.
3873070	3873811	Nice analogy.
3876953	3877534	Metallica who?
3880220	3880840	Anyways.
3881401	3886923	Yeah, so Ultramix sucks ass, and I won't buy it, but I'll download it off of some site.
3887683	3888004	I'm sure.
3889224	3892806	I have video game news.
3892866	3893066	Oh.
3893106	3893666	Hold on a minute.
3893846	3895767	Jamie, everybody has an announcement.
3896127	3900829	Fuck you.
3903390	3904371	I have two announcements.
3905831	3907312	And neither of them are related to Bibani.
3907912	3909413	Shock, shock, shock, shock.
3910561	3920749	The first one is in a few weeks from now in IRC or possibly AIM if I'm feeling like being, you know, nice to people who don't use IRC.
3921870	3926594	Gonna be running a Battle Royale game, stat-based, like a tabletop game except on IRC.
3926614	3929676	Shut up.
3931038	3932339	And then I saw something cool.
3933219	3935141	One of my friends online made me download something cool.
3936602	3939885	It was the teaser for Kingdom Hearts 2.
3943899	3946540	Shut up!
3946960	3958203	It's really cool, except there's all this neat hardcore fighting, and then it's like one of the people doing hardcore fighting, landing in cool poses while wearing lots of black, is Mickey Mouse.
3960124	3963244	So with all this hardcore fighting, is there any hardcore sex?
3965405	3968486	I don't want to know about that associated with Kingdom Hearts 2, thank you very much!
3969969	3970309	Yes, I do.
3970389	3972470	You just do it with the Final Fantasy characters.
3972490	3974151	You don't do it with the Disney characters.
3976452	3978013	This was posted in Jamie's Life Journal.
3978033	3983655	Yeah, actually, that was another thing I wanted to bring up.
3983675	3984415	Post that in the chat room.
3984696	3986556	This is the best fan art ever.
3987077	3994700	For anyone who remembers the race at the beginning of Kingdom Hearts, this is the best fan art ever.
3996627	3998428	What's the score now, eh, Riku?
3998488	4003490	Don't you agree?
4003810	4005711	Final Fuck X, yay.
4007672	4008613	Kingdom Hard-On.
4013535	4015816	I don't know, maybe that's the name of the doujinshi somewhere.
4017416	4018117	Kingdom Hurts.
4022509	4025530	God, this could, like, take up the whole show right here.
4026271	4026871	I'm fine with that.
4027891	4033514	RPG-related, uh... Like, Secret of Mana, Secret of Flesh or something.
4034774	4036235	Welcome to the Temple of Butt.
4036255	4037015	Poking at Mana.
4038255	4042157	Ness151 in our chatroom has an interesting motto for life.
4042757	4045779	When life gives you a lemon, toss it back and scream, HENTAI!
4057430	4073984	Anyways, we should move along here No, when life gives me lemons, I throw grenades back When life throws me lemons, I eat a lime, because limes are better When life throws me lemons, I just give myself glass of heifer bison
4078126	4081147	You know, my friend was telling me about this porn without this lemon.
4081907	4082227	Never mind.
4082548	4084628	When life gives me lemons, I poison the lemonade.
4085929	4086889	That's beautiful.
4087409	4088770	That is the best ever.
4089090	4089350	Thank you.
4089370	4090890	I decided to talk about something else.
4090950	4091490	Okay, anyways.
4092411	4095492	DDR Max 2, obviously, is coming out in like two weeks.
4096332	4098493	More information being released by Konami.
4099453	4101334	Of course, we know we were, you know...
4102114	4107296	Assuming that there's going to be more stuff about being able to create Onis, and that is in there.
4107576	4110177	You can create your own Oni courses, so that's kind of cool.
4110457	4114458	Plus, as before, we were talking about previous songs from DDR Extreme, which are going to be in there.
4115118	4119179	Two confirmed songs from Konami right now are Level of Shine and Crash.
4123401	4126802	Stop it with the ninja cookie thingies, crackers.
4129102	4130903	I am disappointed by this box of Pokey.
4131807	4133768	It does not have a special unit CD.
4134308	4136249	But the words special unit are really funny.
4140651	4142792	You and your special unit can go stand in the hall, sir.
4144632	4146133	Will there be any good porno in the hall?
4148094	4149654	Yeah, why don't you do it yourself?
4150295	4152716	Then I guess me and my special unit won't be working together today.
4155757	4156717	Oh, there's a barcode.
4156757	4159138	Could I win a special unit CD?
4160199	4160439	Huh.
4161098	4165400	I've been asked to play a movie that we got here in the chat room.
4165740	4171522	I don't know, this might cause drops though, so if this causes too many drops, we're going to have to cut this segment, but we'll try it.
4171662	4175623	Because I have done movies on the show way back on episode number like three or something.
4175643	4176623	You remember that whole controversy?
4176663	4178044	Okay, I wasn't here!
4178504	4179324	I remember, I remember.
4179344	4185327	I remember the, you know, it's like a giant spaceship place.
4185747	4187287	Oh yeah, we did play that, you were here for that.
4187347	4189368	We need to do that, put that promo back in.
4190342	4191543	We'll play that after the next break.
4191804	4193185	Okay, but anyway, let's see if this will work.
4193405	4195488	I don't know, we might drop, have some dropouts.
4195508	4196809	We'll see if it works.
4198070	4198411	Okay.
4200633	4201374	Loading, loading, loading.
4201694	4202055	Here we go!
4205686	4209407	Zelda, Duke Onkled is under attack by the evil forces of Ganon.
4209547	4211428	I'm going to Gamelon to aid him.
4211788	4213788	But Father, what if something happens to you?
4214249	4216549	I'll take the Triforce of Courage to protect me.
4216609	4219810	If you don't hear from me in a month, send Link.
4220290	4222731	Impa, don't worry, Zelda.
4223271	4226992	The Triforce of Wisdom promises the king will safely return.
4227532	4227853	Enough.
4228293	4230113	My ship sails in the morning.
4230693	4232354	I wonder what's for dinner.
4233181	4237003	Oh boy, I'm so hungry, I could eat an Octorok.
4240665	4242266	I'm so hungry, I could eat Zelda.
4242386	4245087	A whole month gone, and still no word.
4245307	4246168	Shut up, you hippie!
4246348	4250470	Yeah, that old Ganon's no match for the king.
4250970	4254092	Link, go to Gamelon and find my father.
4254112	4257194	Great, I can't wait to bomb some Dodongos.
4258094	4259535	Dude, Link is totally gay.
4261946	4262889	Wake up, Impa.
4263090	4264455	We're going to Gammon.
4265057	4266020	All right, dear.
4266542	4268208	I'll get the Triforce of Wisdom.
4273564	4274024	Beautiful.
4274164	4275886	You want to see another movie from that game?
4276106	4277587	All right.
4278488	4282271	Since there's such a huge demand for it, let's see another movie.
4282451	4285473	Rob, can you give me back those minutes of life you just wasted?
4285613	4285753	No.
4286113	4286974	In fact, I'm going to take more.
4287074	4290177	Gee, it sure is boring around here.
4290597	4292338	Because I'm playing this game.
4292398	4293379	He's wearing lipstick.
4293439	4293699	So is he.
4300256	4305078	Your Majesty, Ganon and Link came to the island of paradise.
4305099	4307300	Hmm, how can we help?
4307740	4311122	It is written, only Link can defeat Ganon.
4311802	4313543	Great, I'll grab my stuff.
4313863	4315404	There is no time, your sword is enough.
4315424	4316464	By Ganon we mean George Bush.
4317785	4318705	How about a kiss?
4319086	4319586	For luck.
4319846	4320987	You've got to be kidding.
4322267	4323928	Squadala, we are off.
4324769	4325309	Wow.
4325996	4327697	What are all those heads?
4328217	4331199	These are the faces of evil.
4331499	4333601	There's a big map.
4334421	4335862	I guess I better get going.
4336362	4337963	Here is the map.
4338544	4340085	Where do you wish to go?
4344868	4345548	Amazing.
4346769	4347009	Okay.
4347970	4349651	One more, come on, come on, come on.
4351172	4352072	We violated the map.
4352172	4353393	One more, a quick one, a quick one.
4359804	4360824	Oh, I have to click play.
4361385	4362265	I forgot to click play.
4371909	4372289	Wow.
4372669	4373249	That music.
4374790	4375730	That sword noise.
4378591	4382313	According to this video, he was playing the crisscross video game.
4382853	4383853	He's like jumping a lot.
4383993	4385514	That was just amazing.
4388847	4391668	This is why that game is not recognized as part of the Zelda universe.
4391688	4393808	I don't know, did you play Majora's Mask?
4395689	4396309	Majora's what?
4396989	4397269	Yeah.
4398309	4399030	Majora's ass.
4403551	4405671	Um, yeah.
4405731	4409552	So, also in Bomani news this week, we can talk about this.
4409592	4410292	This is big news.
4410573	4411693	This has all the kids excited.
4412633	4415214	2DX Night Style is location testing.
4415314	4416034	Need more tech.
4420203	4421364	I love the look on his face.
4425026	4427187	Some of the songs that are going to be in 2DX9 style.
4427427	4428788	That still makes me laugh.
4428968	4430449	I have to find the link to that page.
4432390	4432850	They have it?
4433071	4434291	I'm going, I'm trying that.
4434772	4442496	But there was another, there was another site that also had, there's a site, the Japanese site that had all the 8th style location tests that has it too and I don't remember where that's at.
4442716	4446598	Newbie Monty Muse, I am two seconds behind Rob on Legend of Max.
4450101	4455405	Um... Shit, I don't... I don't remember where that one site was, the Japanese site.
4457146	4457787	It's not coming up.
4462219	4463980	It's called Jamie Orgasm.
4494362	4494842	Let's see.
4495582	4496983	Power Dream by Pink Pong.
4497864	4498524	That'll be interesting.
4498925	4502447	Rotel the Mercury instead of Rotel the Sun.
4502747	4504528	They're going through the whole solar system.
4504628	4506430	That'll be beautiful.
4506550	4508831	Sampling Masters Aya, Sampling Masters Mega.
4509131	4509532	Emotion 2003.
4510532	4513694	Emotion 2003, which is EOS remixed by Taka.
4514155	4517497	But I thought Taka did the Emotion remix that's in Core.
4518398	4518958	Beatmania Core.
4518978	4520439	Well, that was also called Romantic.
4521540	4523361	So it might be the same damn song for all we know.
4526869	4546574	Good Cool featuring Andrea L. Hopkins called Your Body New Naoki Underground song called Prelude Akira Yamoka with a song that's in Japanese I think it's called Body or that's the genre is Body
4550552	4551112	Lion something.
4553573	4557274	No new Orange Lounge song in 2DX9 style, which is kind of spooky.
4557314	4565536	There is Abyss the Heavens mix, remixed by Ryu, the guy that won the remix contest back then, who did Star Mine.
4566416	4568097	I believe he has a new song in this also.
4571098	4571878	Ryu has a new song?
4571918	4572938	I didn't see that listed.
4573258	4576339	I thought, I don't know, I looked the list really quickly.
4578462	4583344	Yeah, chat room's kind of making some observations, like there's a lot of collaborations.
4583884	4585885	Oh, Arcadian's got it, it's Lion Suki.
4586765	4587125	That's it.
4589086	4598049	No new Orange Lounge song listed as of yet, but if I remember right, with 8 styles test, the Orange Lounge song didn't show up until after... It didn't show up until later.
4598069	4598529	I want Pocky.
4601105	4602546	There was also two different ones.
4602566	4605088	There was Sampling Masters, Aya, and... Right.
4605669	4607110	I guess those are... Aya, whatever.
4607210	4607710	Aya, Aya.
4608151	4608831	Tomato, tomato.
4609051	4609812	Didn't give a fuck.
4610532	4612034	Anyways, let's see here.
4612934	4613935	Healing Hardcore?
4613955	4614816	What the fuck is that?
4615176	4616277	Also, I wanted to show you guys this.
4616437	4618418	There's some pictures that I wanted to show you guys.
4619439	4619519	Um...
4620760	4628006	And I saw pictures on the, where I saw them first was the DJ Trunks Owned You board, which is a fun little site.
4628847	4631308	And let's see, where was that thread on NightStyle?
4631348	4631769	Here it is.
4632449	4636292	And I'll post this link in the chat room for all you folks.
4636893	4637453	Alright, here we go.
4638314	4640275	There's some screenshots of NightStyle right there.
4640295	4643498	Again, it's very blue and orange.
4643858	4645780	It's got like the space station theme here.
4646260	4646981	It's kind of interesting.
4647781	4648422	But look at this.
4648942	4649783	What do these look like?
4652815	4653976	Looks like E-cards.
4654196	4655196	They look like E-cards.
4655676	4657036	Because they say E on the bottom.
4661797	4663738	That's the whole... Okay, how much do you want to bet?
4664658	4665758	And you heard this here first.
4666118	4667999	There will be E-cards for Xtreme 2.
4669319	4670259	Oh, for the new DDR?
4670339	4670839	Whatever it is?
4671239	4673260	Oh, I'll bet you there will be new E-cards.
4673400	4676360	In fact, it will get rid of the whole memory card thing.
4678121	4679641	It seems to be the way where Konami's going.
4681441	4691890	Between Guitar Freaks and Pop Music I have this feeling that they're going to bring out some type of reader With your Playstation 2 or whatever That reads those cards You know another system they tried to do that with?
4692950	4708603	The Neo Geo Where the old NBS units You could take a card and put it on your Neo Geo system at home I've actually got the Neo Geo with the slots open on it I just haven't found a machine with working NBS slots All of our slots are wide open
4710482	4711563	You said it, not me.
4717265	4718786	Well, isn't that special?
4722307	4725909	I think now is a good time for us to take a quick break, and we're going to come back and do the FUs of the week.
4726569	4727650	We have to play that one promo.
4728676	4729456	One promo.

4730557	4730777	Right.

4759265	4760166	Play some TAC.
4761467	4762989	I only have the long mix of abstract.

5019683	5020584	Thanks for watching!
5142722	5143072	Thank you.
5218671	5224374	Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge by Money Music and More show?
5224614	5231757	The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.
5232098	5232298	It's...
5233619	5234080	on Earthly.
5234280	5238023	It's like being at a club, except you don't have to, you know, actually ask someone to dance.
5242146	5242606	And we're back.
5242626	5247890	That sounds like a guy who must have been part of Heaven's Gate or something, talking about going to spaceships and shit.
5249972	5252194	We're having fun opening Ramune.
5252434	5252674	Ramune!
5252694	5254095	I don't have, uh... Rito!
5254155	5254315	Ramune!
5256177	5257738	Ramune!
5260180	5260580	Ramune.
5260941	5261261	Ramune.
5262081	5262302	Um...
5264212	5264812	Rob's a hick.
5264833	5265493	Top Romany.
5265513	5265913	Hunky.
5266073	5266714	Hunky Rob.
5268255	5268595	Okay.
5271037	5271838	All right, kids.
5271858	5272959	Should we do the FUs of the week now?
5274500	5275901	No, because Jamie has to go watch her ass.
5276902	5278683	Dark Child wanted to know where that promo's from.
5278743	5281786	That was that little clip where the guy's talking about dancing on spaceships.
5281806	5282666	That's from a movie.
5282686	5283567	Do you remember the name of the movie?
5284368	5288031	Somebody entered it into some San Francisco film festival.
5288171	5289332	It was in San Francisco.
5289412	5293175	It was somewhere back east, like Rhode Island or some crap like that.
5294375	5295236	Delaware, I don't know.
5295496	5297337	Anyways, it was on the KOA site.
5298357	5301820	I don't know where it's at right now, but yeah.
5302000	5305702	Okay.
5307843	5308183	Alright.
5310325	5310625	Okay.
5310765	5311845	Are we ready for the end of the week now?
5312066	5313606	No, I heard... Okay, really quickly.
5313666	5313807	Sure.
5313827	5314627	It has to be really quick.
5314687	5314947	Sure.
5315528	5316608	Oh, and watch the board.
5316628	5316708	Hey!
5316788	5316908	Hey!
5324479	5329040	I heard there was a rumor going around about Karaoke Karaoke Revolution.
5331781	5334922	Yeah, that's also listed on EB's site if I'm not mistaken.
5334962	5341944	It was either on EB's site or the... Yeah, so... Now, there was that...
5342566	5351291	There was that E3 press release that came out a couple weeks ago that started all these rumors because it said Konami will have you dancing and playing outdoors and singing in 2003.
5351652	5355314	And that kind of made people go, what does that mean?
5355334	5359917	And as far as I thought, I figured that meant that they were probably just going to bring karaoke mode back into DDR.
5359957	5361918	You remember in third mix, you'd have the lyrics on the screen?
5362198	5364900	So you two could sit at home and go, Oh Nick, please not so quick.
5365360	5366401	You know I want it big.
5370083	5371304	That would be cool to come back though.
5372995	5373696	Did I go to CyberZone?
5373716	5374716	No, I've never been to CyberZone.
5401582	5402843	Okay, like I like karaoke.
5403203	5404983	You're pretending that I care about karaoke.
5405964	5407444	I think you just don't admit it.
5408385	5410285	I just think it'd be awesome for a segment.
5410625	5412086	Okay, that's all I'm saying.
5412126	5412446	Blink.
5414327	5418108	Karaoke is Japanese for tone deaf.
5422510	5423690	Can we do the fuckies of the week now?
5423890	5424311	Yeah.
5424431	5425131	Alright, here we go.
5425151	5429973	Okay.
5441440	5454886	Okay, my fight kid of the week goes toward $1hosting.com for having morons for text who don't know that when I say moving to new server, that does mean moving to new host as well.
5455366	5457807	If I say I'm moving to a server, you know what that means, right?
5458328	5460269	Okay, everybody knows what moving to a new server means.
5460689	5462750	Apparently the texts at $1hosting do not.
5463510	5466131	So they're big moron built stupid heads.
5466671	5468912	They're monkeys that fling poo at each other.
5469733	5470013	Okay?
5472808	5473108	and DuploWeb.
5473128	5473609	That's a lie.
5473789	5474269	Okay, I'm sorry.
5474309	5474910	That's a lie too.
5474950	5477191	It's not really $1 because you have to pay a membership fee.
5477331	5478852	So you're not really paying $1 a month.
5480614	5482215	And then there's DuploWeb.
5482495	5487198	I should have known better a company named after knockoffs of Legos.
5488359	5490240	But you know what?
5490400	5492902	They're out of business and now I can't do anything.
5493142	5498606	I mean, I probably still upload to my DarkSakura.com space, but I can't move it to new service because my control panel is gone.
5498886	5499367	They're gone.
5499967	5501268	And ugh, it pisses me off.
5502640	5503681	So yeah, I'm pissed.
5504221	5508084	And then, um... Yeah, I'm done.
5508685	5511187	My angst is somewhat worn off.
5515030	5515650	Oh, it's my turn.
5515971	5516731	Okay.
5517032	5519574	Um... Mostly petty stuff this week.
5519814	5521875	Um... Big F you...
5524311	5544937	Okay, big F for you, Warner Brothers, because I don't like you anymore, because you didn't give me a full screener for the Animatrix, you gave me some fucking trailer that I downloaded off the internet the week before, and also the fact that you're releasing The Matrix Reloaded on May 15th and not last Friday, and the fact that, um, um, you suck.
5546278	5548819	Yeah, Warner Brothers, they suck ass.
5548839	5551659	There's one more reason why I hated them, but I can't remember what it is offhand.
5551679	5553520	Yeah, because they smell.
5554122	5575110	and um, let's see, there's also a big FDU for um, stupid people in Scandia, because that's so generic, and um, um, stupid spammers, and, come on, I, spammers, you jackass, spaniards, what fucking problem is
5575812	5577494	Oh, let's see.
5578935	5579376	Oh, oh, oh!
5579636	5585582	And also to the core, because that movie sucked ass and should have never been made, and it was a waste of time for anyone that went there.
5585602	5588505	In fact, that movie probably slurred your soul, so, um... Then why did you go?
5588525	5589326	I didn't go.
5589706	5589886	Oh.
5590287	5591348	Ha ha ha ha ha!
5591768	5592289	Ha ha!
5594191	5596293	Yes, I didn't go, but I can still bitch about it.
5597214	5597374	Um...
5600016	5605579	Also a big FU to New Line for releasing Kangaroo, or that stupid Kangaroo move, Kangaroo Jack.
5606479	5607300	Captain Jack.
5607320	5612863	See, now that would have been more entertaining if it was Captain Jack running around in the Outback and shooting people.
5612903	5615564	Well, if it was Captain Jack, there would have been a wet t-shirt contest in there.
5615804	5617965	Yeah, exactly.
5621107	5625209	God damn it for making the Matrix Reloaded look so cool and having me wait.
5626278	5633319	and the fact that the Matrix Reloaded is coming out at the same time E3 is and so if we get tickets to E3 I'm not gonna be able to see it even though I bought tickets for it already!
5638540	5639981	You'll be able to scalp those tickets.
5643701	5645202	But I wanna go see the movie!
5646102	5646462	Now!
5646862	5648682	It'll be there when you get back, okay?
5648803	5649823	E3's not gonna be there.
5649963	5651143	It'll be all over the internet.
5652844	5656125	I want to see the movie opening day!
5656185	5658886	I want to see it opening day!
5658966	5661167	I already bought tickets!
5661647	5664008	Because he is one of those geeky guys who dresses like Neo.
5667129	5668730	I set that one up for you perfectly though.
5668870	5669290	You're welcome.
5670130	5672231	So I have the glasses and the trench coat, so sue me.
5672691	5674532	Did you see his Dynamite Rave routine at SCAT?
5676001	5676622	Did you see it?
5676782	5678143	Did all two seconds of it.
5680946	5682487	I don't really have that much this week.
5682547	5686031	I was pissed off during the week and then I just slowly cooled off.
5686371	5686872	I hate that.
5687272	5696821	See, fuck off shows will be awesome when we move because I'll be able to spout off my dislike for society on a daily basis.
5700084	5700545	Alright, I'm done.
5703440	5706202	My FU of the week goes out to Pokemon Ruby.
5707443	5709605	Because ever since I bought that game, I can't stop playing it!
5710426	5711667	And I feel like really immature.
5712968	5713529	But you know what?
5713569	5713989	It's fun.
5714670	5715831	How many Pokemon are in that one?
5716551	5717292	Like, about 200.
5717332	5717612	It's a lot.
5718973	5721195	Really quickly, this will only take a second.
5721375	5729741	F you to the press because they don't realize that all these Iraqi children that are killed in the street are probably from all the gunshots that people are firing in celebration of the fact that the regime is over.
5730101	5732362	They don't realize that bullets go up and then they come down.
5732563	5733763	Why are all my children dead?
5733844	5734564	I do not know!
5735425	5743771	So... Right, um...
5744954	5747220	They fire off a gun and there's birds falling everywhere.
5747781	5748383	Squirrels.
5748844	5751110	Little Iraqi suicide bombing squirrels.
5751741	5754063	You know, I came up with a good idea for your Pokemon thing.
5754543	5758986	It was if, like, they had, like, a fighting game where the Pokemon actually had to fight each other.
5759006	5759606	Pokemon Stadium!
5759906	5761347	No, like, to the death.
5762068	5766351	And, like, there would be three, there would be, like, different, yes, there would be, like, different classes.
5766451	5770153	There would be adults, and then little ones, and then there are some of them.
5770474	5779980	Yeah, like, you know how you have, like, Pikachu becomes Raichu, and that's all they have, but then there's ones where it's, like, Squirtle, and then I forget what he turns into after that, and then he becomes Blastoise.
5780000	5780160	Wow.
5782121	5794690	Yeah, Wartortle Anyways, there's one more thing really quickly They're releasing a live version of Battle Angel Battle Angel Remember the cybernetic chick that fights people and shit?
5794991	5797392	A live action version Are they basing it off of a comic?
5797492	5807760	Yes The comic's ruled Alright, I didn't really have any FUs of the week outside of that So I guess I'm done Let's go around the room and hear from everyone else Zero
5810242	5811523	Okay, I actually have a couple.
5811563	5814164	Not a whole lot, and this is the worst music to choose.
5814564	5815465	What a feeling!
5815565	5815965	Anyways.
5816365	5817606	No, um, okay.
5818046	5819927	One of them I realized at Art and Fair Mall.
5820408	5823950	To the stupid bastards who can't wash their hands after they go to the bathroom.
5824290	5827432	I don't want to touch the fucking door handle after you touched it.
5827852	5829853	I don't want your lemon juice all over my head.
5830673	5835616	Um, and for the stupid... I don't give a shit what it is, it's fucking gross.
5836177	5836677	And then, like...
5840335	5849638	No, and then the next thing is, for the people who made those stupid hand dryers, make them warmer or something, because make them actually fucking work.
5850739	5855680	You're not reading the directions, it says rub your hands together, it works, trust me.
5855740	5857421	No, you know what those hand dryers are for?
5857821	5860722	You have those in the men's restroom, you want to know why?
5860742	5862763	So they don't have to restock paper towels for us.
5863223	5864364	The women have paper towels.
5864464	5866146	They also have nice mirrors, nice toilets.
5866706	5867347	Everything's clean.
5867367	5871390	Because the women are... See, have you been in the women's bathroom at Arden Fair Mall?
5871870	5878356	I'm sorry, the whole place smells like... It smells like urine and it's full of the dumbest people in the universe.
5879217	5880297	And there's water everywhere.
5883240	5886162	And, like, another FU goes to the whole Pokemon thing.
5886182	5887884	It needs to die and die quickly.
5889005	5890246	It's gone on way too long.
5890902	5895363	Followed by, um, yeah, that stupid Beyblade, because that sucks, too, and Yu-Gi-Oh!
5895723	5896383	Yeah, bye-bye.
5896683	5897103	Bye-bye.
5897263	5897543	Bye-bye.
5897804	5903965	Magic cards were cool, like, I don't know, ten years ago, or whenever they came out, and, um... Exactly!
5904245	5905925	Stop rehashing old cartoons!
5905945	5907126	They weren't good, they... Oh!
5907366	5907506	Oh!
5907866	5908526	Oh, I mentioned a statement.
5908566	5909426	Never mind, that's alright, that's fine.
5909846	5914767	Oh, one more thing, uh, F you to Konami for not releasing the DDR stream, because I'm certainly bored of DDR streams.
5915187	5916048	I'm getting bored.
5918607	5919487	My other F.U.
5919507	5922609	of the week goes toward not having money because there's certain things that I need.
5923509	5925750	I need a tablet, a graphics tablet for my computer.
5927231	5930372	I need a light table to use for my art.
5931773	5936575	I cannot find... Where do I get non-photo blue pencils?
5936955	5938196	I need non-photo blue pencils.
5939016	5940237	I know where you can get money for that stuff.
5941617	5942297	Come to Camhar.
5942618	5943358	Put it on a wish list.
5945148	5946068	What?
5946168	5950470	No, you should do what those people do on the internet, like the ones who say, help me pay my bills.
5950950	5955431	And people send them like five bucks, just tell people, help me, help me make my comic.
5956151	5958652	Help me, help an aspiring, you know, comic artist.
5958852	5962213	The thing is, is that my, my comic's gonna be all fucked up anyway.
5962533	5962914	Hello?
5963654	5964894	I guess fucked up comics sell.
5966275	5967035	Well, that's the whole point.
5967075	5969796	I don't know, would anyone in here buy it if I, like, published it?
5969936	5970536	I'd buy it.
5971252	5973994	because I like your writings as it is.
5974755	5975936	You should make a comic of it.
5976516	5990407	Well, my other big fuck you goes toward not having a proper drafting table and illumination because once I scan in all the stuff that I've drawn, I see all this crap that I missed because I don't have the proper light to do any of it.
5990927	5993749	So, yeah, fuck not having a drafting table with a built-in light.
5994130	5995671	F you to not having money, okay?
5995811	5998093	I have to get a fucking costume ready for the damn...
5998993	6000675	and I have no money.
6000695	6001816	We're going thrift store shopping.
6002297	6002637	I know.
6003117	6005760	I found out the perfect idea for the number two.
6005780	6006521	We'll talk about that later.
6008783	6009423	I figured it out.
6009563	6010845	Actually, he helped me figure it out later.
6010885	6013587	Anyways, I'm done with my FU because just fuck that.
6016630	6016810	No.
6017851	6019873	Some of us other people have fuck you's too.
6019973	6020374	Okay.
6020874	6021435	Fuck you then.
6024116	6025020	No, don't fuck both of us.
6025040	6025280	Anyway.
6025722	6028552	Okay, come on, continue.
6028592	6029134	Is Anita up next?
6030211	6031812	You should get the PS2 version.
6031912	6033152	I don't have room, but I could try.
6061935	6062936	It's not the same.
6063877	6065259	Hey, it's fine.
6065279	6068562	You can be even stupider in your own house instead of out in the game with a bunch of people.
6070103	6070484	Okay.
6070944	6080614	Well, this leads into my next Fuck You of the Week, which is Fuck You to Milpitas Golf Land, because they have... Okay.
6081074	6083897	Disney Mix, that stupid Disney DDR.
6083997	6085539	I hate that game because...
6086323	6086763	Let her finish.
6110143	6113728	So anyway, um, oh, I had one more from Milpitas, I forgot what it was.
6114068	6117513	Oh, what's that place we went to with all the video games and the alcohol?
6118374	6119015	Dave and Buster's.
6120083	6122765	Fuck you to Dave & Buster's for not having any bimani.
6123185	6124626	Dave & Buster's doesn't have any bimani?
6124886	6125327	None!
6125967	6126227	What?
6126528	6127268	But they have alcohol.
6127788	6128889	They have alcohol.
6128929	6129730	They have pump it up.
6130590	6130971	That's it.
6130991	6132152	Do they have horse crack at Dave & Buster's?
6132772	6133773	They have horse crack.
6133813	6135314	Drinking and playing horse crack.
6135974	6137535	Drinking and playing horse crack is pretty cool.
6137555	6139497	Why do they call it horse crack?
6139537	6141358	I thought it was Derby Owners Club or something like that.
6141418	6142839	It is Derby Owners Club, yes.
6143319	6145901	But yeah, but no bimani around really sucks.
6146402	6148343	So anyway, those are my fuck you's of the week.
6148383	6149464	Thank you very much.
6151205	6151625	Hook me up.
6151786	6152166	I'm next.
6152306	6152946	I have a quick one.
6153807	6154667	Give me a different song.
6156848	6157689	Don't say no to me.
6158409	6158970	I own you.
6162712	6164393	Hit and slap on Vilemix.
6170324	6170784	Okay, whatever.
6170964	6189589	Okay, my fuck you goes to, I know this is like an old one or whatever, but people on the internet who don't want to label files correctly when they're sharing on PCPs and stuff, I downloaded a 712 megabyte file yesterday, and I've got DSL and it should go fast, but it's on Kazaa, so it was going at like, at the fastest 20.
6189809	6192870	Anyway, it took like a day to do.
6193451	6194591	I tried to install it, it's
6195635	6198720	Return to Castle Wolfenstein, and it's supposed to be Grand Theft Auto Vice City.
6200262	6204888	I was like, yeah, yeah, exactly, wait, wait, I was like, exactly, Return to Castle Wolfenstein, fine, I'll play that.
6205369	6210236	It gets all the way through the installation to 99%, this file is corrupt, please download it again.
6210777	6211458	I'll give you that, King.
6212645	6214166	Cool, hey, make a picture of it.
6214426	6216586	That will teach you to pirate software, little boy.
6216606	6219847	You haven't come out for the PC yet.
6219887	6220428	Yeah, you tell us.
6220448	6223128	But there are, like, really great videos out there.
6223609	6225409	Ah, that's what you get for trying to get that.
6225829	6229831	See, I had the same thing where I tried to get Lord of the Rings 2, and I got Sorority Boys.
6230471	6233112	I loved Sorority Boys all the goddamn time.
6233892	6235853	Sorority Boys was, like, everywhere for a while.
6235873	6237753	Like, any movie you downloaded was Sorority Boys.
6237773	6239614	We're going to have an evil time when Battle Royale 2 is out.
6242039	6242799	What was the other one?
6242859	6250922	Oh, there was another one I tried out a little bit, I said it was GTA Vice City, and it was like, uh, some, it wasn't porn, but it was like some kiddie game.
6251142	6255383	It was like Mavis Beacon 2003 or something.
6255683	6257784	Mavis Beacon's the shit, I'm sorry.
6259045	6259965	That's how I learned to type.
6261445	6264106	I already know how to type, I learned how to type from playing on IRC.
6264466	6266147	God, not type on Mavis Beacon.
6268088	6269128	You're gay, dude.
6272084	6277065	If you didn't get that, Zero says Mavis Beacon is a 250-pound black woman.
6277805	6278345	Is she really?
6278565	6280406	Mavis Beacon is the Oprah of computers.
6282006	6283206	Oprah's not 250 pounds.
6285086	6285507	She was.
6285547	6287527	Maybe her breasts are.
6287587	6289367	You know what's really, really, really scary?
6289387	6290608	She's going to be posing nude.
6291388	6291668	No.
6292328	6293488	Yes, serious.
6293548	6294968	She was looking for the right photographer.
6294988	6297109	I guess the one who can shave off 300 pounds off of her, but...
6301972	6302613	Oh, really?
6302693	6303193	This week?
6305334	6308836	For a lady of her age, she looks pretty good.
6309697	6311178	She's like 50-something.
6312198	6313959	Or about 50, I don't know.
6314119	6316781	But the point is, we don't need to see her naked.
6317061	6319403	I don't want Dr. Phil jacking off to her magazine.
6319583	6322605	Oprah needs to gain 200 pounds and stay there because Fat Oprah's cool.
6324446	6326547	She was in the color purple and she kicked ass.
6326647	6329048	Fat Oprah good, skinny Oprah bad.
6331144	6333826	Hey, hey, hey, it's Rad Oprah!
6334567	6338190	I have determined that people lose personality when they lose weight.
6338230	6339171	They lose IQ, too.
6340812	6342434	They turn into hoes and lose IQ.
6343154	6345717	Let's get through the last two people FUs in here, please.
6346337	6347578	Okay, my FU time.
6349039	6349820	Fuck you!
6349840	6351782	Not me.
6352899	6355562	I have two fuck yous.
6355602	6357163	One is to Zelda, the Wind Waker, okay?
6379213	6380513	It's an awesome game.
6380533	6381634	Fuck you for having Zelda.
6381694	6382394	I don't even have it.
6382474	6384355	I can't get it because they're out of stock everywhere I go.
6384595	6387136	Fuck you for telling him to fuck off because he has Zelda.
6387436	6388256	Yeah.
6388336	6392777	Anyway, fuck you to Zelda because the story was so incredibly cool.
6392797	6398199	I won't spoil the ending for any of you, but if you play it, you'll know what I mean, I think.
6398339	6398839	Link wins.
6400100	6401080	Link does not win.
6403226	6404607	Like I said, I'm not spoiling it for anything.
6404667	6405547	I'm taking the mic away!
6406407	6411470	Anyway, so fuck you to Zelda, because you'll see what I mean when you play it.
6411490	6412970	Yeah, and the fact that Link looks like a monkey.
6413270	6416292	And especially fuck you to that little kid with the booger hanging out his nose on your home island.
6419093	6423195	My second fuck you is fuck you to the world for not giving me anything to complain about this week except Zelda.
6423215	6426116	I mean, my god, I'm actually happy this week, and that's not okay!
6428068	6429448	Fuck you to this week.
6429829	6435530	Because it seems like everyone who normally has lots of fuck you's has lame fuck you's because they're too goddamn fucking happy.
6437070	6438210	Yeah, Jamie's were cool though.
6438250	6440451	Alright, let's see what the chatroom has to say.
6441491	6442131	Let's get into the chatroom.
6442151	6442711	Fuck the chatroom.
6443052	6444472	No, we're going to do the chatroom fuck you's now.
6444512	6445012	Here we go.
6445592	6451433	USFVB would like to say, fuck you to whoever decided that POWs are heroes.
6451513	6452014	What the fuck?
6452034	6453574	If you're a prisoner of war, that means you fucked up.
6457000	6459043	That was very politically incorrect.
6461326	6462547	Fuck you.
6462948	6466613	That was more politically incorrect than anything Loki's ever said.
6467714	6468615	Who said that fuck you?
6469296	6470097	Who said that fuck you?
6471098	6472781	What's the screen name of who said that fuck you?
6472841	6473401	USFBB.
6474162	6475024	USFBB?
6477402	6478823	All right, well, what the fuck is that?
6479023	6479803	Fuck you.
6480103	6482244	POWs are fucking the shit.
6482564	6484604	Do you know what kind of hell they have to go through?
6485084	6487085	They fucking get tortured and all this shit.
6487105	6489506	They are fucking heroes because they made it back alive.
6491166	6499569	But that's because I'm an ex-military guy, so... I swear to God it's only irony that I have this background song.
6499629	6500589	I didn't plan that.
6503340	6508301	Wow, okay, Ness151 says, FUs to me being poor and not being able to play DDR anymore.
6508381	6509501	No tokens equal no life.
6511182	6514042	Get a hookup at Golflands of Scandia, then you won't have to pay for tokens.
6514822	6518503	Remember that we're an international show, so they don't have Golflands of Scandias everywhere.
6520324	6520764	They should.
6522704	6527825	Alright, Mooheimer says, fuck Xenon for having such sucky easy steps.

6532768	6535830	Fuck Coalition, is that Coalition?
6535930	6536470	I have no idea.
6536570	6543234	Coalition dates that you barely know who are friend of friends who don't leave you the fuck alone all night like they own you.
6543954	6548376	It was so bad, in fact, that I had to ponder using the I'm gay approach to get her the fuck away from me.
6549117	6550958	You know, I just have to say this over air.
6551478	6551858	What?
6552198	6554540	Jamie, you have a little bit of drool on the right side.
6556000	6556361	It's God.
6558402	6558602	It's Orgel.
6558622	6558842	It's Orgel.

6594574	6599015	Dark Tetsuya would like to say, fuck being single and not having enough nerve to talk to the ladies.
6601036	6601836	Just do it.

6608938	6609938	I X'd out of it already.
6610138	6615299	I think it was... This is going to be Jamie being a bitch.
6616259	6617640	And please forgive me for being a bitch.
6618400	6618900	Get over it.
6619180	6622101	Just go out there and do it and stop feeling sorry for yourself.
6623038	6623538	Yeah, you know what?
6623838	6625079	That brings me to a fuck you I can remember.
6625099	6625639	I'm going to say it now.
6625659	6627080	I'm going to just jump in on these chat room ones.
6627520	6628561	Fuck you, VOG.
6629081	6630442	VOG, come on, man.
6630782	6634804	You had DD Alcoholic go up and pimp a chick for you.
6635265	6637146	Get some fucking balls, man.
6637186	6638226	It's just a girl.
6638326	6639207	Hey, hey, hey.
6639527	6640788	Best advice ever.
6640908	6641868	You want to talk to women?
6642168	6644870	Go to a fucking strip club because they're forced to come talk to you.
6645210	6645450	Okay?
6645470	6649292	And they will carry on a conversation for long hours and you don't have to pay them shit.
6649592	6649812	Okay?
6649852	6652534	They'll just come talk to you and then after you get done the conversation, they're like,
6652714	6653474	Do you want to laugh at this?
6653694	6654035	Uh, no.
6655035	6655935	See, it's perfect.
6656076	6664379	You only spend initial, like, $20 to get in, but talking to strippers is awesome, and you'll just totally get over the whole fact that you're, like, intimidated by women because they're really hot.
6665540	6669922	Or you could go to, like, a hospital, to ER, where people are stuck there laying in their hospital beds and can't get away.
6674336	6675197	Oh, my God.
6675857	6680660	It's because when you're talking to hot, like, retarded women, it's not very, you know, intimidating.
6680680	6683902	When you're talking to hot, intelligent women, that's when I'm intimidated.
6685042	6688604	You must be going to the city limits, man, because fucking, fucking A, dude.
6688864	6692487	Well, Showgirl's awesome, or Pure Gold, or wherever the fuck.
6692867	6694388	Centerfold, that's it, Centerfold.
6695628	6696669	Okay, fuck yous, next, please.
6698391	6712663	Alright, Snub Dissonoid likes to say, fuck you to the cat penis sucking, tree hugging, weed smoking hippies that thought it would be a very cool idea to take a perfectly good FD RX-7 twin turbo, rip out the motor, and slam in some weak ass electric piece of shit motor.
6712703	6713704	How fucking dumb can you be?
6714004	6719729	You take a rare, special, and very fast sports car and you turn it into some fucking tree hugger beacon that radiates pure shit.
6719789	6720169	Fuck you.
6720710	6721991	Also, fuck you to this thing.
6722031	6724353	And he gives a couple flash things that I'm not going to look up right now.
6725213	6729995	Fuck you to the people who made those for not giving out any warnings to people who have heart problems.
6730415	6734536	I don't personally, but those could either A, kill fat people, or B, scare the holy living shit out of kids.
6734957	6736117	Maybe some people, not even kids.
6736157	6737257	I mean, those are just kind of fucked up.
6737618	6739918	There's some fucked up flashes that I'm not looking at right now.
6741819	6747021	Angel would like to say F you to whatever sickness everyone is getting, because I caught a bit of it too earlier in the week.
6747641	6750162	F you to Magus being away, and yeah, I'm better now.
6750542	6751903	By the way, I haven't gotten sick yet.
6751923	6752923	Just letting everyone know.
6753911	6757771	For those who think it's SARS, I mean, that's pretty fucked up because we'd all be dead.
6757791	6758374	Hold on.
6758925	6759906	Little fact about SARS.
6760446	6764588	All the people, there's been like 400 something people who've gotten SARS, only like 12 of them have died.
6765848	6769650	But all the people who got SARS, it's been from traveling to somewhere else.
6769810	6777294	None of the actual disease or whatever it is, hasn't been from people sitting in their own house or going to like clubs or stuff.
6777654	6781196	You have to go to somewhere where it's been, you know.
6781736	6785058	Like people, somebody flew into LA and that's how somebody in LA got it.
6785078	6786619	Anyway.
6786659	6786939	Anyway.
6787506	6792068	The point is, it's not SARS because I know a lot of people who've gotten sick and they all got better within about three or four days.
6793688	6795529	Fuck you for being way too serious.
6795569	6796970	God damn, it was a fucking joke.
6797330	6802011	Well, it's because my better half is very sick right now and it would suck if that was SARS, okay?
6802272	6803812	It wouldn't be a funny laughing matter.
6805573	6808634	Has Irene been to Hong Kong lately?
6812215	6813396	You know we're right, okay.
6813856	6814696	That was my point.
6814896	6816457	Japan Man would like to say...
6818141	6818701	Back to FU's.
6819021	6821142	A Japan man would like to say, fuck Norton antivirus.
6821182	6823042	I've updated my definitions five times now.
6823082	6823742	Must be a virus.
6824262	6824982	Fuck my computer.
6825042	6827463	Its record was six deaths in ten minutes, I think.
6827883	6829263	Fuck this arcade worker girl.
6829363	6831703	Press the damn button to fix the screen and put a bra on.
6832164	6833124	Can you stand on them?
6834384	6835604	And fuck flat-faced on it.
6835684	6836504	I have no idea.
6837264	6841045	Okay.
6841385	6843766	SkylineDC505 says, F you to hormones.
6843886	6844346	Nuff said.
6844846	6845126	Mm-hmm.
6846360	6855248	Shadow would like to say, right now, the only FU I have right now, I hate not being able to find a nice, quiet place with my girlfriend.
6855288	6858210	Fuck people for being around to nose around and spoil the mood.
6858230	6861273	Until you go to your house.
6862314	6863815	You live in a damn forest!
6864335	6865016	Shit, man!
6866497	6867258	Go somewhere!
6867298	6867758	Trees!
6868079	6868439	Trees!
6868819	6870180	I mean, there's roads that go nowhere.
6870200	6871221	The roads that parallel each other.
6871241	6871782	The forest!
6874821	6885104	VidPower, last FU, VidPower would like to say FU to my computer for not booting up Windows XP correctly, FU to my monitor being all screwy whenever I turn on my computer, and FU to turning in homework during spring break.
6886244	6888005	All right, FUs are over, yay.
6890045	6891286	Now would be an excellent time.
6895927	6900769	I think now we're going to talk about the Orange Lounge cage match.
6901689	6902229	Yay.
6902249	6902309	Yay.
6904588	6922716	Last week, last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, quite a controversy breaks out over the song that won, which was a band called Freeze Pop, with a song called Science Genius Girl, and that was the song they did in Frequency.
6924136	6928018	And, uh, Zero and Tao, Shivam, got into it.
6928638	6931620	And, uh, I made them hug when it was all over.
6932500	6933421	Did you like that, Rob?
6934041	6934681	It turned me on.
6934701	6935882	A little bit of man-on-man action there.
6935902	6936502	Did you join in?
6937162	6937963	No, I did not join in.
6939984	6950409	Okay, as for that whole little argument we got in, we were actually talking in IRC, and I admitted that, yeah, I do like some freeze-flop songs, but I absolutely can't stand that, and we made up and we're friends again.
6952522	6952682	Aw.
6953343	6954423	You made out in your friends again?
6954563	6955664	Yeah, you made out in your friends again.
6955684	6956084	Alright.
6956885	6958185	Here's a clip of... Sorry, Xerox.
6959666	6960867	Here's a clip of last week's winner.
6960907	6962668	Remember, you can vote for three songs.
6962688	6965510	You can vote for the song that won last week or one of the two new songs.
6965990	6969612	And this winning song goes into rotation on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music and More program.
6970913	6971213	Alright.
6972834	6973174	Here we go.
6973254	6973934	Last week's winner.
6973954	6974454	Here's a clip.
6974515	6976976	Freeze Pop, Science Genius Girl here on Orange Lounge Radio.
6993969	6997390	It will be a member of my band It will be a member of
7066741	7067863	I'm sorry, we were out just then.
7067884	7068866	We had dead air just there.
7069086	7072273	I had the stuff muted because people were talking over that last one.
7072573	7074157	You're gonna have to introduce the song again real fast.
7074197	7074638	Sorry about that.
7075385	7081488	Okay, let me run the title through one more time, because I need to give actually the name of the mix.
7081989	7083930	It's Eminem mixed by DJ Tripp.
7084170	7086171	It's Without Me, Dark Side of the Force mix.
7086611	7088052	And where did you find this?
7088692	7093655	Well, he brought the CD with it over to my house, and I ripped it.
7094435	7099538	DJ Tripp is one of my fiancé's good friends, and he's a DJ in Santa Cruz.
7099638	7102460	And apparently his stuff's been played on Quad locally before.
7106084	7109769	And usually we don't care for Eminem, but this is a remix.
7111011	7112473	Alright, here we go.
7112733	7115297	This is Eminem mixed by DJ Tripp with Without Me.
7175080	7203962	I created a monster, cause nobody wants to see Marcel no more, they want Shady, I'm top livin' Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor, some vodka that'll jumpstart my heart We'll get in a shock when I get stopped at the hospital by the doctor when I'm not cooperating When I'm rockin' at table while he's operating You waited this long to stop debating, cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating I know that you got a job, Miss Chaney, but your husband's heart problem's complicating So the FCC won't let me be, you'll let me be me, so
7239670	7242754	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7276390	7304610	You said for me, now this looks like a job for me So everybody just follow me Cause we need a little controversy Cause it feels so empty without me I said this looks like a job for me So everybody just follow me Cause we need a little controversy Cause it feels so empty without me A biscuit, a tasket, I will sit the task with Anybody who's talking this shit, that shit Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked Worse in the middle than biscuit bastards And Moby, you can get stoned
7305503	7307524	36-year-old boy had a bag load.
7307744	7310064	You don't know me, it's too old, let's go, it's over.
7310224	7312325	Nobody listen to techno, now let's go.
7312625	7314766	Just give me the signal, I'll be there with a hold.
7314846	7316586	It's full of new insults, I've been don't.
7316746	7320508	Suspenseful with a pistol ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol.
7320528	7324369	But sometimes it just seems everybody only wants to discuss me.
7324549	7326469	So this must mean I'm disgusting.
7326689	7328410	But it's just me, I'm just a scene.
7390828	7394356	Alright, that was Eminem remixed by DJ Trip, a song called Without Me.
7394436	7396580	Now we go around the room and see what everyone thought.
7396861	7397122	Jamie?
7398825	7398845	I...
7399608	7405971	Personally, I mean, I more or less really like it just because he's a cool guy, you know, he's a fan friend.
7407692	7424700	That, I look at the overall presentation, because if you think about it, a lot of what, you know, rap that you hear nowadays is just, you know, more of the same specific stuff, so I think it's kind of neat to hear it done a little differently, and I like how it flows together, so, you know.
7425638	7429159	I give it a 9, personally.
7430579	7431459	Alright, Zero?
7433940	7437361	Actually, I am really not an Eminem fan at all.
7437721	7440321	Everybody who knows me knows I absolutely hate him.
7440902	7447503	But I've actually seen DJ Trip one time in Underground, and I thought he was really good, and everything only gets better from this song.
7447983	7454245	But on this song, based alone, I give it an 8, because it was done pretty well.
7454345	7455005	Moving on, Loki.
7455700	7457541	Okay, I'd like to hear more of his stuff.
7458402	7462044	I do like Eminem, but that remix was simple.
7462584	7463284	It was simple.
7463304	7464245	It was an acapella track.
7464265	7468627	You take some stuff from the Star Wars soundtrack, and you take a breakbeat, and that's about it.
7469708	7473470	It was put together a little hastily, it sounds like, and, I mean, it could have been better.
7473490	7474471	It could have been better.
7474491	7483076	He could have done some stuff to vocals, you know, maybe remix that a little bit, but it was pretty simple, and it sort of went... It was... Overall, I mean, you gotta have to understand...
7483909	7487991	Even some of the most simplest stuff works, but I'm going to have to give it a 7.
7490633	7491373	DDRholic?
7491393	7494895	Hey, yeah.
7494955	7496837	I'm going to give it a pretty decent score.
7496937	7498578	It sounded really cool.
7499138	7501659	Put together well, as far as I can tell.
7502020	7504661	I really don't know that much about putting those things together.
7505522	7509444	But if Loki says it wasn't that difficult, then I'll believe that too.
7510024	7517966	But what I really like about it is that it put visions in my head of Darth Vader doing hip-hop dancing with the stormtroopers behind him.
7518567	7521628	And like titles like DJ Vader.
7521748	7526389	And then the big-tittied girls in the back with the Princess Leia hair going, Oh yeah, baby!
7526409	7532331	Yeah, with the DJ Vader, Hoochie Mama girls, and the stormtroopers featuring...
7533411	7537253	DJ Jazzy, Emperor Jeff, and you know, all that kind of stuff.
7537293	7540314	And then the octopus-headed race doing stuff.
7541034	7544015	I haven't seen the part two yet.
7545956	7546537	Blue Nose Guy.
7546557	7549098	The guy with the blue nose playing the synth and doing scratching in the background.
7549358	7551839	Oh, the band from Jabba the Hutt.
7552039	7553880	Yeah.
7554600	7555780	Yeah, the Blue Nose Guy.
7555820	7557161	They look like an elephant thing.
7559969	7565156	Yeah, so, you know, I could have maybe done a little bit more with it, added some stuff to it, but it was pretty neat.
7565196	7565696	I liked it.
7565937	7566457	I'll call it an 8.
7567198	7567879	I'll give it an 8.
7568820	7569101	Alright.
7570282	7575028	As for me, I don't like Eminem, and I don't like Star Wars.
7575248	7578492	I think they're two of the most overrated things in modern American culture.
7579417	7582738	But, when they come together, it's not so bad.
7582838	7584459	That really wasn't that bad.
7584539	7586219	I kind of like it, actually.
7586339	7590200	It's better than the original track.
7590220	7592101	The music in Star Wars was actually always pretty good.
7592121	7592981	It's just the movies I don't like.
7593361	7596282	So, seven and a half, overall.
7596902	7598083	So two wrongs make a right.
7598423	7600463	Yeah, so two wrongs in this case do make a right, yes.
7601944	7602544	Three less do.
7607973	7612875	Alright, that's what we have to say on Eminem mixed by DJ Trip without me.
7612975	7614715	Now, Loki, what did we hear last?
7615815	7618396	We get to hear a song by this group called Hamperberg.
7620097	7628259	I was introduced to this song by our friend Eric, Punk Knight, and it's called Duck Toy, and you'll see why.
7629360	7630640	I'm very scared, but here it is.
7630700	7632401	This is Hamperberg with Duck Toy.
7632801	7633121	Enjoy.
7772638	7783024	I want it, I need it, oh yeah, I want it
7842366	7845287	All right, that was Hamperberg with Duck Toy.
7845307	7847808	That's the last song you can vote for in tonight's cage match.
7847828	7849989	Let's go around and see what everyone thought about that one, Jamie.
7851730	7852390	It gave me a headache.
7852810	7853610	I mean, it was cool.
7853730	7854411	It was really neat.
7854791	7855511	But it gave me a headache.
7856764	7864986	So, and then there was like, when that woman started talking and making moaning noises, my response was, meanwhile, in another song.
7865506	7869067	So, yeah, um, I get the, I get the seven.
7870647	7871528	But it still gave me headaches.
7871948	7872568	Hi.
7876229	7876749	Zero?
7876769	7886071	Okay, as we all stare at the bondage for it, um, I don't know, okay, the beginning of that song sounded like a bad bowel movement.
7886798	7907376	and then it moved into making me laugh my ass off once the rubber duckie started going and then all of a sudden it just switched songs and started going into a chick started off with something that sounds like you bastard um, all together that song really confused me and it might as well have had the smell of the sound it started with I would give it like a 4
7909824	7910945	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network,
7932509	7935170	I wonder if I can make a song with this duck.
7936710	7939031	I'll make a techno song with this rubber ducky.
7939111	7941312	I mean, it's just, it was funny.
7942292	7942932	DDRholic?
7944013	7945413	I thought it was really funny too.
7945453	7948154	That's a killer, killer duck.
7948234	7950315	I don't know who, what kind of, if it was really a duck.
7950355	7954216	It sounds like a dog toy to me, but it could have been a dog toy duck, whatever.
7955416	7958818	That song brought to mind erotic imagery of Bert and Ernie, and for that it gets a 6.9.
7985924	7986925	6.9, what does that mean?
7987185	7987705	Alright.
7989146	7990546	That means it's getting some.
7992007	7996129	You can send in your votes now and here are the three songs you can vote for in tonight's cage match.
7996209	7998490	Last week's winner, Freeze Pop with Science Genius Girl.
8004432	8008994	This is Eminem mixed by DJ Trip with Without Me.
8020229	8021930	and Hamperberg with DuckToy.
8030893	8034715	All right, you can vote for either one of those three songs right now.
8035375	8036455	Right freaking now.
8037816	8041497	Send those votes to me, private message, Sky, in the chat room.
8042778	8047900	And some folks in the chat room saying all three songs suck this week and they're not voting.
8050807	8053568	You'll be damn glad I was going to play the Kyle Snyder song again, okay?
8055069	8055869	That's right, you know what?
8055989	8060491	I said last week, I wasn't planning on winning that last week.
8060551	8061592	I didn't think I was going to win with that.
8062312	8063733	And I said I was going to play the Kyle Snyder song.
8063753	8068235	You're required to vote, or I will be angry with you.
8069005	8069486	Uh-oh.
8070847	8072429	And you don't want me to be angry with you.
8073971	8074271	Okay?
8074791	8075172	All right.
8077374	8081259	We're going to take... Well, I don't really want to take a break, so we need to talk about something else.
8082800	8083501	Can I break something?
8083941	8084182	Okay.
8085752	8086573	I don't have anything to break.
8086613	8087994	I can't break the bottle lid again.
8088394	8089675	Zero, do you want to talk about video games?
8089695	8091116	Do you have a review you want to give us?
8091416	8092316	Oh, okay.
8092416	8094037	I can try to throw something together here.
8094298	8099561	I wasn't fully prepared, but Kingdom Hearts 2 does actually sound decent.
8099881	8102843	I can't wait to at least see a good demo of it.
8103804	8103964	What?
8105800	8106701	Oh, finish Kingdom Hearts?
8107161	8107921	Okay, I'm almost done.
8107961	8114444	I just beat Agrabah, but I've been playing The Getaway lately, which is on my review list, even though it's kind of not really a new game.
8114544	8116245	But, um, I don't know.
8116425	8118006	The gameplay of that game is cool.
8118306	8119687	It's kind of sketchy sometimes.
8121616	8125699	All the character models are really good until they start moving.
8126459	8130522	When they start moving, it looks like a bad epileptic seizure or something.
8131483	8139048	Sometimes it's really smooth, and the other times they start doing the whole classic PS1 movies where it's all real blotchy and jittery.
8139648	8146792	The gameplay is good, the story is good, involving, nor have I ever heard a game use the word fuck so many times in 10 minutes.
8147293	8152035	It's just fucking this, fucking that, and it's all in an English accent, so either way you'll get to laugh pretty well.
8153036	8157639	Yeah, they get away.
8158699	8162982	Some of the mission objectives are kind of hard to understand, you can't understand what the fuck they're telling you to do.
8163826	8165487	Because you're not speaking English English.
8166748	8173232	I talked to my friend in the UK, and they said, and I was talking to him, and he's all, I can't understand you, he's all, why don't you speak English?
8173272	8173813	I said, I am.
8174133	8174453	You're not.
8174593	8174873	Anyways.
8176134	8178916	Another game is, oh yeah, a big one right now.
8179156	8179977	Automodelista.
8180977	8183159	I have a couple- Did you just say Automolesta?
8184454	8185555	Santa Moleste Nente
8215177	8216998	That means to be good at it, you don't play it.
8238467	8242951	But you will get annoyed with it very quickly if you don't like the staring.
8243031	8244612	It's kind of a hit or miss thing.
8245173	8247835	As for the Xbox, I really don't have anything up my sleeve right now.
8248255	8249896	I haven't had a chance to play anything.
8251498	8253259	Save up $200, get Steel Battalion.
8253279	8253259	$200?
8254200	8256041	Why don't I just play it at your house?
8258023	8260445	Steel Battalion will make anyone feel manly.
8261505	8265909	When you sit in front of this gigantic controller, it makes you feel like you have the world's biggest penis.
8268610	8295885	as Brad comes in and demonstrates um yeah another one for those of you who haven't played Xenos Saga go pick it up because you'll enjoy it there are really no good fighting games out right now except for all the classics um GameCube games still play Zelda it's a good quality game you'll kind of laugh at first when you see all the little cartoony figures and stuff um
8298123	8301524	Let's see, Metroid Prime, still play it, even if you haven't.
8302884	8305484	That's about it for right now until I start playing more.
8305544	8308065	Now that I have a job, I'll be able to actually play more games.
8308085	8310806	But I gotta go over to your house and play games at your house because you have a bunch.
8313506	8316507	And then more of you need to play Phantasy Star Online with me and Rob.
8317507	8319927	Yes, and I need to get my broadband adapter thing back.
8321668	8324908	And I'll be able to play it as Rob's character when we move in.
8326149	8327909	Yeah, you can put up to four characters on one card.
8332622	8336624	My character for Phantasy Star Online looks like she's 12 and has these big pink pigtails.
8339506	8339806	Bless you.
8339826	8342348	I thought you were going to say big pink boobs, sorry.
8343368	8343909	That's you.
8345489	8351553	But next week, this week I have a few games that I'm going to get a hold of and play and see what they do.
8351613	8356936	So next week, or whatever week we do it again, I'm going to have a lot better of a review.
8357962	8358983	Still play Clock Tower 3.
8359824	8364148	If you haven't played Clock Tower 3, I'm going to come and like... Well, I'm not going to play it, but I just want to see all the cutscenes.
8364688	8367931	I'm going to send that little bloody girl over to kill you.
8369212	8372335	Because, you know, she was from Battle Royale and she'll kill you.
8372415	8377159	If anyone's ever seen the actual article for it, it's got the survivor of the first game.
8377219	8378240	I will send her over to kill you.
8378600	8379621	Because she's pretty hardcore.
8380622	8381783	Yeah, and she has that creepy smile.
8382549	8383410	And she has a bear.
8384331	8385012	Or a little doll.
8385412	8392819	And you know, every movie where they have dolls, they're always the biggest killers.
8393360	8394701	So, yeah, I can't wait.
8396423	8397224	I'm gonna have a doll.
8398045	8398986	It's gonna be the Loki doll.
8399206	8399887	It's gonna be a monkey.
8402639	8404560	They're like, Monkey, kill him.
8405400	8416285	Once again, I'd like to remind our listeners that probably in about a month or so, we're going to be running a Battle Royale tabletop style game over IRC.
8416565	8417846	You will have stats.
8418586	8423708	We'll have the details published somewhere soon, possibly on DarkSakura.com.
8424089	8426810	You still have to teach me how to play so I can join in.
8427510	8428551	Everyone will have to learn how to play.
8428571	8429371	We're making up the rules.
8429451	8429912	Okay, good.
8429992	8430712	Then you'll have to teach me.
8430732	8431633	I win.
8431693	8432473	No, you don't win.
8433274	8437336	I will go ahead and reveal a couple of little tiny things that aren't major secrets.
8437757	8439338	Can I be the guy?
8439418	8443320	You know the guy that does the thing?
8443901	8449104	You will be allowed to have a proficiency, but some proficiencies will be assigned, and one of the proficiencies is lucky bitch power.
8449966	8453969	Yeah, and Dark Child and I will actually be playing a lot of games this week.
8454209	8457651	He's kind of like the other guy behind my reviews and such.
8457792	8461954	So this week we'll try to at least get eight games and try to run them and see what happens.
8462855	8464776	And that's all I got right now, but next week will be better.
8465997	8468799	I have a review for Dracula X for the PC Engine Duo.
8468859	8469580	Best game ever.
8470300	8472021	Go save up the $300 and buy it.
8472902	8474243	I have a review for E.T.
8474263	8474443	for the 2600.
8474543	8475104	Best game ever.
8475144	8475284	Yeah.
8479240	8480801	I have a five word review for that.
8481321	8482601	Actually, no, an eight word review.
8483281	8485562	Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass.
8486602	8488663	Ooh, Jamie likes the ass.
8489823	8490723	I have two words for you.
8490983	8491404	Attack.
8492544	8492864	That's it.
8493684	8494624	Wait, for the new E.T.
8494664	8497025	coming out, the best part is, it's not out.
8498765	8499306	But it will be.
8501626	8504887	The best part will be when you don't turn on your console to play it.
8506374	8508354	Okay, I think now's a good time to take a break.
8508875	8510375	Yeah.
8511595	8512075	All right.
8513976	8522518	All right, this break, since the last break we did all these songs that start with A, I thought it would be only appropriate to do songs that start with X, Y, and Z. Anal sex.
8523198	8523878	So here we go.
8524178	8524798	We'll be right back.
8526899	8527359	Anal sex.
8570742	8571584	Thanks for watching!
8718997	8719862	Thanks for watching!
8824284	8828305	Alright, we're setting up now for Orange Lounge match game we're going to play tonight.
8829006	8832046	But we have to jot down some questions really fast and get all the celebrities prepped.
8832206	8833387	And we have to get some contestants.
8833447	8841109	So, the contestants that will be playing match game tonight will be the first two folks in the chat room who can answer me this question.
8841849	8843470	Alright, Jamie's going to get good because I don't.
8845731	8847291	What is Jamie's favorite shooting game?
8847711	8848632	No, that's stupid.
8848692	8849952	Will people be able to get that though?
8849992	8851632	Yes, because I've said it a bajillion times.
8852353	8853033	What's your question?
8853801	8856143	Who's the artist that did Dead End?
8856163	8857864	And the actual artist, not Naoki.
8859246	8861387	Okay, so you have to answer both those questions.
8862348	8864510	A. Who is the artist that did Deadline?
8866951	8870933	Dead End A. Who is the artist that did Dead End, not Deadline?
8871173	8875296	That's question A. And B. What is Jamie's favorite shooter?
8875436	8877017	She's said it a million times on this show.
8877298	8883682	If we don't have anyone that gets A and B right, I think A is a little easier, so we'll use A as the answer and B as a tiebreaker.
8884682	8888945	So, Jamie's favorite shooter and the artist that did Dead End.
8889606	8889886	Alright.
8891702	8896425	And in the meantime, we're going to play a nice little song to prep us all for match game.
8898146	8902248	And that song will be Dr. Bombay, because this show needs help.
8902668	8905230	And I think this is also an inside joke with Jamie and Maren right now.
8905270	8906231	At least I pick up on that.
8906951	8907291	It's not?
8907631	8908332	It has nothing to do with it.
8908352	8911033	But I mean, the name of the song, if you say it as a word, does.
8912734	8913635	A little bit of dual meaning.
8914475	8915016	Dr. Bombay
8946929	8947952	Thank you for watching!
9127000	9128241	Orange Lounge Radio.
9128581	9130723	We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
9131544	9135707	This server made a bit of money, yeah, number... This server made a bit of money, yeah, number...
9137240	9152091	All right, we are back, and let's get to the winner of the match, or not the match game, we don't know that yet, but the winner of the cage match tonight, sad but true, you voted DuckToy as the winner of tonight's cage match.
9158115	9158635	Oh, boy.
9160957	9161858	Let's just say that again.
9162418	9164220	That sounds like some strange Vietnamese soup.
9164420	9165741	DuckToy, I want DuckToy.
9169029	9171830	That's okay, because I can bring the other Freeze Pop song next week.
9175032	9175352	Alright.
9177433	9179774	Okay, so now let's talk about contestants for match game.
9180494	9183216	Nobody got both questions right.
9184976	9189298	Right, but we have people that got one right, and we have people that got the other one right, but nobody got them both right.
9189798	9194160	So, first off, the person who got Jamie's favorite shooter question correct, Jamie.
9194240	9195181	What's the favorite shooter?
9195201	9195361	Shooter.
9197370	9197730	Shooter.
9198471	9199292	Shooter.
9199452	9200512	Radiant Silvergun.
9200953	9205616	First of all, for you people who try to name Doom and Hexen, those are first-person shooters.
9205636	9206557	Those are not shooting games.
9206577	9207558	Those are first-person shooters.
9207718	9208398	There's a difference.
9209159	9214083	A shooter is like Gradius or Parodius or Radiant Silvergun.
9215083	9215524	And R-Type.
9215604	9216184	R-Type's awesome.
9216624	9219106	But Radiant Silvergun is my favorite shooting game.
9219787	9221568	Followed closely by Osha Berry Parodius.
9222068	9226652	So Dark Tetsuya was the only one to name Radiant Silvergun as Jamie's favorite shooter, so he's in by default.
9227310	9233853	So, we have Dark Tetsuya versus, and we decided to eliminate all the people that put Hexen in Doom, because that was a pretty good amount of people.
9235854	9240536	And we were left with somebody who said Gradius, which is kind of like Parodius.
9240836	9242457	Well, Parodius is a parody of Gradius.
9243137	9247239	But, oh well, you win by default, so Justin Circuit is contestant number two.
9249540	9250600	And no one got N and S?
9250620	9256643	A lot of people got N and S. I was talking all the people who, a lot of people got N and S. What's funny is Dark Tetsuya, that's the one question he didn't get.
9257429	9258690	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9287702	9290144	Celebrity number one, tell us who you are.
9296167	9297809	And what are you here to plug this week?
9304673	9306154	Contestant number two, say hello.
9307816	9310518	Your mom And what are you here to plug this week?
9310758	9315201	Likes cheese Alright, contestant number three, what is your name?

9339762	9341824	Alright, contestant number five, say hello.
9343125	9344326	Actually, you're not a contestant, you're a celebrity.
9344366	9345387	Celebrity number five, say hello.

9364200	9366381	Good, we have an actual amount of celebrities.

9401602	9402142	Well, maybe.
9402202	9402623	Well, maybe.
9402843	9403964	That's how you want to answer the question.
9404024	9404264	Fine.
9404744	9413972	Norman the Newbie was so new to DDR that all the regulars were really getting fed up with his antics and wished he would really stop doing the blank every time he played.
9424646	9433523	Norman the Newbie was so new to DDR that all the regulars were really getting fed up with his antics and wish he would really stop doing the blank every time he played.
9461934	9467363	Dude, that was like, Kodachi from Ranma.
9475592	9476693	Alright, once more.
9477753	9484758	Norman the Newbie was so new to DDR, but all the regulars were really getting fed up with Xantix and wished he would stop doing the blank every time he played.
9484778	9485699	Okay, are all the celebrities in?

9510928	9522132	Dark Tetsuya says, Dark Tetsuya says, Norman the newbie was so new to DDR, but all the regulars were getting really fed up with his antics and really wished he would stop doing the caution drop every time he played.
9525353	9527154	Justin says,
9528476	9536348	Norman the Newbie, he was really sick, and wished Norman the Newbie would stop doing the pelvic thrust every time he played.
9538411	9538711	Alright.
9539632	9540554	Jamie, what did you say?
9541909	9542690	It's a Truffle Shuffle.
9542870	9544192	The Truffle Shuffle!
9549217	9549738	Zero.
9550979	9555243	I said that he would quit headbanging to Daiken Kai.
9555664	9559288	I'm tired of all seeing those damn bastards sit there while they're playing Daiken Kai on Easygoing.
9560734	9562015	It looked like fucking morons.
9562295	9563356	That was great radio, by the way.
9563717	9564297	Yes, I'm sorry.
9564377	9570242	I was stamping in place and putting the little metal symbol up in the air and headbanging.
9570582	9572684	It's the stupidest thing in the world, and knock it off.
9574546	9574866	Alright.
9575367	9575607	Loki.
9579028	9595353	I said that he would stop singing with the music, basically, actually not really singing, but making noise to the music, like going, woo, woo, to the whistle song, and clapping at odd times, because, you know, newbies, they don't have rhythm in the first place, so they can't keep up with the song.
9595373	9597294	They're also, woo, woo, oh.
9601495	9602036	Yeah, it's like that.
9602436	9603216	Alright, Anita?

9624536	9625076	It won't fit.
9627598	9628058	Oh, God.
9628519	9631801	You know, he might be small enough... He might not have a problem with that...
9636578	9637398	In-house speakers are down.

9792840	9795900	I was so happy that I basically shit all over the machine.
9796220	9798061	He shit all over the machine.
9799862	9801222	Figuratively shit.

9839631	9841692	And last celebrity, Dark Child.
9841772	9849374	He was so happy he... Busted a fat milky nut all over his man juice, coating the machine like a Krispy Kreme glazed donut.
9853823	9854223	Hold on.
9854543	9854804	Wait.
9854884	9855464	Good answer.

9856164	9857025	I have to respond to that.
9857585	9859286	Do not defame the Krispy Kremes.
9860726	9862727	Can you say, like, Bel-Air Donuts or something?
9863748	9865849	I'm hungry now and I want Krispy Kremes.
9867010	9868050	I don't want those Krispy Kremes.
9868891	9870031	New flavor of the month.

9897357	9900278	The first thing she exclaimed was, blank.

9939611	9939751	Yep.
9940031	9943373	Jamie was so excited to walk into game land to find that they had a radiant silver gun machine.
9943393	9946115	The first thing she exclaimed was blank.

9966368	9966468	Uh...
9968914	9970975	Yes, I know this waiting sucks, but you know what?
9971696	9973037	That's the way the game worked, too.
9973077	9974838	And they all, like, fiddled with each other.
9974878	9976119	Anyway, here we go.
9978841	9987907	Jamie was so excited to walk into game land to find the Outer Radiance Overgun Machine, the first thing she exclaimed, Justin Circuit says, the first thing she exclaimed was, this game is mine!
9991167	9995109	Dark Tetsuya said the first thing she exclaimed was, squee!
9996630	10000292	Alright, here we go, around the room, Jamie wants to go last, so we'll start with zero.
10000432	10001112	What was the first thing?
10001312	10002913	Oh, we're gonna go this way, okay, we'll just go in backwards.
10002953	10004354	Dark Child, first thing she said was, 37?
10004894	10005214	In a row?
10010205	10011165	Alright, I got five.

10012785	10013286	Okay, Anita.
10014006	10022487	First thing she exclaimed was... Beautiful.
10023687	10024388	Oh my god.
10025688	10028008	I just made my own Krispy Kreme glazed donut.
10028668	10028808	What?
10029168	10031129	I just made my own Krispy Kreme glazed donut.
10031909	10032509	New promo.
10033469	10034109	You're welcome.
10034189	10034529	Wow.
10036710	10038250	Orange Lunch Radio, it's orgasmic.
10038812	10042954	Loki, first thing she exclaimed was... This is a hard one.
10043114	10044295	Squee, of course.
10044715	10049157	Alright, Squee, so we have a point for Darkatsuya, hooray.
10051218	10058201	Alright, next up, Zero, first thing she exclaimed was... Why the fuck isn't anybody playing this game?
10060542	10061703	I actually did think that.
10063284	10065965	It was sitting there, beautiful.
10066963	10069084	All alone and for one credit.
10070225	10074308	So when I went, and I have to hold the microphone away so everyone holds your ears.
10074848	10075088	Yes.
10075368	10077570	I went, squee!
10077950	10078330	Like that.
10078869	10081791	Okay, uh, I actually made a mistake.
10082251	10086413	Justin Circuit's answer was actually, because I only saw the part that was in caps.
10087034	10090135	He actually said, squee, this game is mine.
10090315	10091036	That was the full answer.
10091076	10092296	So he actually got a point too.
10092536	10093617	And they both get two points.
10093737	10093997	Yes.
10094177	10094418	So.
10095498	10096999	But I did a very high pitched squee.
10099477	10103399	Okay, so we are all tied up at 2-2.
10104860	10106080	Oh my god, that game is beautiful.
10107161	10109782	And Ikaruga is going to be out on the GameCube soon.
10110182	10113164	Alright, two more questions, here we go.
10114264	10118486	The nudist colony couldn't wait to get Para Para Paradise at their nude arcade.
10120087	10122228	I don't know if you knew this, but the nudist colony has a nude arcade.
10123354	10129940	But the arcade owner refused to get it because if I get that game, there will be too much blank.
10133823	10137286	The nudist colony couldn't wait to get Para Para Paradise at their nude arcade.
10137747	10142371	But the arcade owner refused to get it because if I get that game, there will be too much blank.

10181096	10181897	Don't look at my feet.
10186440	10188161	It's not that I need new socks, I need to do laundry.
10192204	10192745	Moving on.
10192805	10193685	Okay, is everybody in now?
10194006	10194186	Yes?

10195347	10195707	Here we go.
10196367	10204734	Nudist Colony couldn't wait to get Para Para Paradise at their nude arcade, but the arcade owner refused to get it because if I get that game, there will be too much, Justice Circuit says, pole dancing.
10205254	10206455	Too much pole dancing.
10208536	10210397	Dark Tetsuya says there will be too much.
10210818	10212179	Humping the coin slots.
10212699	10213900	Alright, Jamie, what did you say?
10214260	10216382	Nudist Colony couldn't get it because there will be too much?
10216782	10218243	Groin stank from sweaty balls.
10218584	10220645	Groin stank from sweaty balls?
10222326	10223147	Oh my god.
10225709	10229752	I now have to save that to put into one of my future stories because I like that reference.
10231794	10233235	I'm just mentally thrown up.
10235080	10235320	What?
10235540	10236801	I've just mentally thrown up.
10236961	10242262	Okay, but the nudist colony couldn't get it because there will be too much... Old people body parts flopping around.
10242862	10244503	Old people body parts flopping around.
10244583	10245763	Loki, I fear this answer.
10246123	10258387	It says the nudist colony refused to get par par because there's going to be too much... Well, actually, you're going to have to rephrase it because there's going to be too much of a nice fish market smell in the air.
10261208	10263949	So kind of the reverse of the stank balls answer.
10265290	10266010	Pubic Stank.
10267031	10267712	Oh, God.
10268572	10270814	That's a phrase I never wanted to hear on this show.
10272475	10275176	It took 40 episodes to hear Pubic Stank on this show.
10275236	10275677	Thank you.
10276797	10277518	Oh, God.
10277998	10278799	Are we in kindergarten?
10279059	10280720	We're making milestones every minute.
10281600	10282261	Absolutely.
10283041	10285303	Well, you know what my original answer was?
10285923	10288365	My original answer was Flying Snake Grenade.
10288385	10290406	Pub Stank.
10292246	10299288	Anita, the nudist colony refused to get Parapara because there would be too much... I don't understand why this is so funny.
10299648	10302489	There would just be too much testicular dryness.
10302529	10305090	I mean, this is a very serious subject we're talking about here.
10305570	10310951	I mean, do you understand the incidence of testicular dryness in this country?
10311051	10314272	You just don't even know how serious a problem it is.
10316213	10319654	Anita, I think Anita just wants to volunteer to go over there and lick everyone's balls.
10321334	10322514	I have testicular dryness.
10324555	10324735	Yeah.
10325736	10328356	If you want him to come faster, you need to lick his balls.
10332598	10333058	Wow.
10333818	10334198	Wow.
10334278	10335379	All I can say is wow.
10336819	10339140	Let's see if we get a match on this last one with Dark Child.
10339160	10340600	Can I get the sound from Jamie, though?
10340701	10342161	Yeah, we can.
10342941	10343341	Okay.
10343642	10347463	Okay, there will be too much bootleg porn on the internet.
10347663	10349283	Bootleg porn on the internet.
10349323	10350684	Good answer, but not a match.
10351852	10352172	All right.
10353634	10354114	Here we go.
10354515	10355235	Last question.
10355275	10355876	And you know what?
10357457	10360960	I have a good sense of humor.
10361321	10363643	I can be self-deprecating because this question is about me.
10366085	10368647	Rob was surprised that no one at the gay bar knew.
10368807	10370969	And I don't know why I was at a gay bar.
10370989	10371830	I just was, okay?
10371850	10374352	Let's just assume, you know, hey, Rob went to a gay bar.
10376414	10377735	Robby's still in my Animal Crossing village.
10379849	10383691	Rob was surprised that no one at the local gay bar knew what DDR was.
10384611	10387813	He thought the best way to explain it to them was to blank.
10393896	10397798	Rob was surprised that no one at the local gay bar knew what DDR was.
10397898	10400619	He thought the best way to explain it to them was to blank.
10401700	10402440	Say whatever you want.
10402460	10402821	I don't care.
10402841	10403341	I've heard it all.
10410143	10414926	Rob was surprised that no one at the local gay bar knew what DDR was, because DDR is such a gay game.
10415586	10418488	He thought that the best way to explain it to them was to blink.
10422371	10424172	One contestant's locked in, I think.
10424752	10426073	Let me just verify this answer.
10428815	10430576	Ah, brilliant answer.
10431196	10432537	I'm waiting on one more contestant.
10442194	10442734	All right.
10446935	10448896	Okay, we have both contestants locked in.
10448936	10450336	Are all our celebrities locked in?
10450376	10451496	Our fabulous, wonderful celebrities?
10451916	10453597	It's all tied up, so it's got to come down to this.
10454697	10456998	Or we're going to have a tie, and there's not enough time for a tiebreaker.
10458058	10458939	All right, everybody's in.
10459499	10459999	Okay, here we go.
10461903	10466004	Justin Circuit says, Rob was surprised that no one at the local gay bar knew what DDR was.
10466044	10470606	He thought the best way to explain it to them was to undress slowly while on the DDR machine.
10472867	10473207	Blink.
10474087	10478449	Except there's no DDR machine at the gay bar, or else I just, wouldn't I just point and say that's DDR?
10485586	10486066	Whatever.
10486366	10494187	Alright, DarkTetsuya says, The best way to explain it to them was to grab the nearest chair and start stomping his feet wildly like he's playing Legend of Max.
10494688	10495148	There we go.
10495248	10495708	Good answer.
10496208	10498728	Alright, let's see if it's either one of those two matches.
10498828	10503389	Jamie, Rob's best way to explain this at the gay bar was to... Propel.
10504389	10507670	Oh my god.
10508393	10510775	That was a total, like, EOSFVB answer.
10510835	10513257	Anyway, it was zero.
10513317	10517920	The best way to explain it to them was to... Tell them DDR stood for Dick Dick Revolution.
10518661	10521243	Tell them DDR stood for Dick Dick Revolution.
10523265	10525366	And with some of the players, that's very true.
10525406	10527868	In fact, if you go to this one arcade, it's called... Never mind.
10529409	10530971	That's a match game question for next week.
10533192	10536435	Loki, Rob thought the best way to explain it to them was to...
10537541	10541242	Um, was to point out anybody that's doing white boy freestyle.
10542823	10545023	Point out anybody that's doing white boy freestyle.
10545303	10545684	Beautiful.
10546204	10550045	Anita, the best way to explain what DDR was, was to?
10550845	10557907	Um, I thought the best way was to strip butt naked and country line dance in front of the karaoke machine while playing It's Raining Men.
10559888	10561048	I did that two weeks ago.
10565496	10567217	At least that involved nudity, which is exciting.
10567738	10579327	Dark Child, the best way, I can't wait to hear this, the best way to explain DDR was to shimmy, sashay, pirouette, left cheek, right cheek, blow a kiss, pose.
10579587	10580427	It's fabulous.
10586092	10587373	Oh my god!
10593163	10595646	Everybody wants to know how Dark Child knows this.
10597569	10598610	Where was that from, Dark Child?
10598630	10601434	I don't know where it's from, I just came up with it.
10601734	10602756	Oh, even worse!
10603236	10606881	It kind of reminds me, I think it's the scene in Drop Dead Gorgeous, but anyway, doesn't matter.
10607281	10607542	Anyway...
10609842	10612064	I was just thinking more about Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.
10612384	10613185	Ah, there we go, yes.
10613625	10616548	Okay, so it ended in a tie tonight.
10616588	10619130	Two points for Dark Tetsuya and two points for Justin.
10619230	10621652	So that means we have no winner.
10622172	10623793	And do we like it when there's no winner?
10624194	10624574	No.
10624694	10625615	Boo.
10625715	10626455	You suck.
10626656	10627536	Get better next time.
10628297	10630439	A big fuck you to all the players who lost.
10632098	10635140	I like it when no one wins because then we don't have to think of prizes to not give them.
10635261	10637942	Well, what are some consolation prizes we should give these two for tying?
10638062	10639984	A box of rice-a-roni, the San Francisco treat.
10640184	10640584	Ding, ding.
10643026	10645467	How about their own personal home version of Deep Thick Revolution?
10646668	10650691	You two will personally get me explaining DDR to you in Anita Fashions.
10652512	10654894	How about you make them get the next PC version of DDR?
10662014	10664595	That makes me a sad panda.
10667116	10674778	They get a hand and a can of Crisco.
10676778	10681120	And it's time for the jingle.
10682580	10682820	Ready?
10683320	10686641	Rice-a-roni, the San Francisco treat.
10686661	10688702	No, no, no.
10694955	10700418	By the way, I have to give a public thank you over the air to Sharks Girl for my filler bunny.
10702360	10707363	I love my... Is the pink one that big in the test tube?
10708103	10710545	Melody got me my filler bunny for my birthday.
10715123	10717104	I've just detected a fault in the AE-35 unit.
10745936	10746936	Ice Queen, final thought?
10748677	10749597	I need sex.
10751777	10752897	Dark Child, final thought?
10753418	10755078	Dark Child is about to die.
10756998	10764780	And my final thought is also, my final thought is also, I need sex, but not with ice cream.
10775039	10776060	Um, okay.
10776181	10778363	The final, final word of the night.
10778383	10779344	Jamie got it last week.
10779444	10780104	Final word of the night.
10780164	10782587	Anita, what is tonight's final word of the night?
10784108	10785530	Ka-dunk, ka-dunk, yeah!
10786894	10787454	DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS
10813496	10831303	Satan's Game Your children, like it or not, are attracted in their weaker years to the occult, and a game like D&D fuels their imagination and makes them feel special while drawing them deeper and deeper into the bowels of El Diablo.
10831983	10838387	This afternoon, the Dead Ale Wives Watchtower invites you to sit in on an actual gaming session.
10839028	10847994	Observe the previously unobservable as a hidden camera takes you to the inner sanctum of Dungeons and Dragons.
10850335	10853357	Galstaff, you have entered the door to the north.
10853998	10857160	You are now by yourself, standing in a dark room.
10857700	10861583	The pungent stench of mildew emanates from the wet dungeon walls.
10863336	10864337	They're right next to you.
10864657	10865799	I cast a spell.
10865939	10867220	Where's the Mountain Dew?
10867380	10868822	In the fridge, duh.
10869002	10870323	I want to cast a spell.
10872003	10873645	Yes, you can have them out and do.
10873685	10874445	Just go get it.
10874685	10876087	I can cast any of these, right?
10876247	10876747	On the list?
10876807	10878729	Yes, any of the first level ones.
10878789	10879850	I'm gonna get a soda.
10879970	10881251	Anyone want one?
10881551	10883833	Hey, Cram, I'm not in the room, right?
10883993	10884794	What room?
10885255	10887617	I wanna cast Magic Missile.
10887637	10890559	The room where he's casting all these spells from.
10890619	10892481	He hasn't cast anything yet.
10892861	10894222	I am, though, if you'd listen.
10894362	10896264	I'm casting Magic Missile.
10896404	10897946	Why are you casting Magic Missile?
10897966	10899307	There's nothing to attack here.
10900973	10902434	I'm attacking the darkness!
10905755	10906676	Fine, fine.
10906956	10908176	You attack the darkness.
10908496	10909837	There's an elf in front of you.
10909877	10910497	Whoa!
10910637	10911338	That's me, right?
10911658	10917060	He's wearing a brown tunic, and he has gray hair and blue eyes.
10917180	10917841	No, I don't.
10917901	10918761	I have gray eyes.
10919421	10920222	Let me see that sheet.
10920362	10924243	Well, it says I have blue, but I decided I wanted gray eyes.
10924324	10924824	Whatever.
10924924	10927285	Okay, you guys can talk to each other now if you want.
10928851	10929211	Hello.
10929771	10930232	Hello.
10930832	10933353	I am Galstaff, Sorcerer of Light.
10933714	10936455	Then how come you had to cast magic missiles?
10938956	10940617	You guys are being attacked.
10940677	10942558	Do I see that happening?
10942678	10945019	No, you're outside by the tavern.
10945099	10946300	Cool, I get drunk.
10947781	10949762	There are seven ogres surrounding you.
10949902	10950903	How could they surround us?
10951043	10953264	I had Mordenkainen's magical watchdog cast.
10953324	10954024	No, you didn't.
10954144	10955125	I'm getting drunk!
10955245	10956565	Are there any girls there?
10956625	10957546	I totally did!
10957566	10961007	You asked me if I wanted any equipment before this adventure, and I said no.
10961327	10966390	But I need material components for all my spells, so I cast Mordenkainen's faithful watchdog.
10966430	10968031	But you never actually cast it.
10968151	10970672	Roll the dice to see if I'm getting drunk!
10970692	10970752	Ugh.
10971488	10972468	Yeah, you are.
10972668	10974129	Are there any girls there?
10974169	10974549	Yeah.
10974769	10975550	I did, though.
10975670	10977670	I completely fed when you asked me.
10977770	10978551	No, you didn't.
10978851	10981572	You didn't actually say that you were casting the spell.
10981632	10983113	So now there's ogres, okay?
10983133	10983833	Ogres?
10984193	10986094	Man, I got an ogre-slaying knife.
10986154	10988355	It's got a plus nine against ogres.
10988375	10989355	You're not there.
10989395	10990455	You're getting drunk.
10990595	10994277	Okay, but if there's any girls there, I want to do them.
10994697	11023273	there you have it a frightening look into America's most frightening pastime remember that it's not your children's fault that they're being drawn into a satanic world of nightmare it's their gym teacher's fault for making them feel outcast when they couldn't do one single pull up thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week
