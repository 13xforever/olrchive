WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.000
Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk and then some.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.280
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

00:29.280 --> 00:34.780
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted and mildly retarded content.

00:34.780 --> 00:39.060
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.060 --> 00:42.900
Yes, I will spank your child. If you're not going to do your job, God damn it, I will.

00:42.900 --> 00:45.500
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

00:45.500 --> 00:47.280
Thank you, F

00:47.280 --> 00:49.980
Well, here's my big opening.

00:49.980 --> 00:51.560
A sphincter says what?

00:51.560 --> 00:53.740
I'm super. Thanks for asking.

00:53.740 --> 00:56.580
Oh, you little bitch-troll from hell!

00:56.580 --> 00:57.820
What am I doing here?

00:57.820 --> 00:58.320
Haha!

00:58.320 --> 00:59.820
Nooooooo!

00:59.820 --> 01:00.320
Eh?

01:00.320 --> 01:01.200
Dodge this.

01:01.200 --> 01:02.200
Mm-hmm.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.320
This is a tasty burger.

01:04.320 --> 01:07.000
Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left!

01:07.000 --> 01:08.040
Yes, I have!

01:08.040 --> 01:08.920
Look!

01:08.920 --> 01:10.080
It's a flesh wound.

01:10.080 --> 01:13.040
Searching for a boy in high school is useless.

01:13.040 --> 01:17.200
It's purchased for meaning in a poly-shore way.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.200
Oh, yeah?

01:18.200 --> 01:21.780
Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

01:21.780 --> 01:22.960
Dark Sakura.

01:22.960 --> 01:27.960
I had a sniff, Sky, but I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer, Loki.

01:27.960 --> 01:31.960
I hate you, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:31.960 --> 01:37.960
We are live and this is episode number 68 for November the 9th of 2003.

01:37.960 --> 01:42.960
You're tuned in to the Bimani scene's most female challenge tonight,

01:42.960 --> 01:46.960
Radio Station of all things Bimani.

01:46.960 --> 01:48.960
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

01:48.960 --> 01:54.000
And joining me as always are half of my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny

01:54.000 --> 01:58.600
on the farm is Jamie Summers, is all the way in that corner that's in Alabama.

01:58.600 --> 01:59.600
She's out tonight.

01:59.600 --> 02:02.200
She's on vacation.

02:02.200 --> 02:03.200
So no Jamie tonight.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.200
Sorry everybody.

02:04.200 --> 02:09.680
But we have some more guests here to help kind of fill that void that Jamie has left.

02:09.680 --> 02:10.680
Is this mic on?

02:10.680 --> 02:11.680
Yes, the mic is on.

02:11.680 --> 02:12.680
Hello?

02:12.680 --> 02:13.680
Yes, like you said.

02:13.680 --> 02:14.680
What?

02:14.680 --> 02:15.680
Testing?

02:15.680 --> 02:16.680
There we go, yeah.

02:16.680 --> 02:23.680
on

02:46.680 --> 02:51.680
the fuck up. Just kidding. Say a little likey style. You know him, probably, if you listen

02:51.680 --> 02:54.680
to Vanilla Sky on Monday nights, right? Because he's always here.

02:54.680 --> 02:58.680
I hope you know me. Probably just like that annoying guy who always gives us his stupid

02:58.680 --> 03:03.680
opinions about how games are cool and some games aren't. That's right.

03:03.680 --> 03:08.680
Also, if anything, he's cool and you all suck. Thank you. Also here tonight, say hello

03:08.680 --> 03:13.680
to Bradley. Also known as Sarcadia32. Hi, how are you?

03:13.680 --> 03:23.560
Well, we have someone who has never been to the show in the house before.

03:23.560 --> 03:27.560
He says, join us for some of our live remotes, but never in the house.

03:27.560 --> 03:29.360
Say hello to Vanders!

03:29.360 --> 03:30.360
Mahalo!

03:30.360 --> 03:31.360
How are you?

03:31.360 --> 03:32.560
I am well, thank you.

03:32.560 --> 03:35.280
That's good, I'm glad you could make it.

03:35.280 --> 03:37.160
Thanks, I'm glad to be here.

03:37.160 --> 03:38.160
This is exciting!

03:38.160 --> 03:40.600
Our home base is exactly what I thought it would be.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.600
Lots of anime, lots of DVDs, lots of games.

04:12.600 --> 04:16.200
Soundtrack for our breaks because I know you guys have been wanting to hear some of the new stuff

04:17.100 --> 04:23.480
During this break. We're gonna hear a brand new mr. T song doing the goonies are good enough. This is awesome

04:24.540 --> 04:31.260
Shut it is awesome. You're outvoted Loki also in this break. We're gonna hear an artist called Noki Noki. Oh with a song called

04:31.780 --> 04:33.780
pata pata mama

04:34.080 --> 04:40.220
pata pata mama is the name of the song we're gonna hear second and then also in this break we're gonna hear a really cool remix of

05:40.220 --> 05:42.220
Oh

06:40.220 --> 06:42.220
Ba-da-ba-da

06:42.220 --> 06:44.220
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da

06:44.220 --> 06:46.220
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da

06:46.220 --> 06:48.220
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da

06:48.220 --> 06:50.220
Yo, Kuji

06:50.220 --> 06:52.220
Amado ba-da-ba-da

06:52.220 --> 06:54.220
U-da-da-i-na

06:54.220 --> 06:56.220
Kichi-ji

06:56.220 --> 07:00.220
O-na-re-ke-do-ke-do-da-i-do-koro

07:00.220 --> 07:02.220
Hachi-ji

07:02.220 --> 07:04.220
La-ba-lo-ki

07:04.220 --> 07:07.220
U-o-me-ka-me-ka-ku-su-me-ga-ki

07:07.220 --> 07:09.220
Ku-ji

08:39.220 --> 08:49.220
You didn't have to believe in how you were dead

08:49.220 --> 08:53.220
Let it stop, let it stop, let it stop

08:53.220 --> 08:56.220
It might be still what it could be

08:56.220 --> 09:00.220
For you I thought that there's been an open

09:00.220 --> 09:03.220
If you wanted to live in a higher world

09:03.220 --> 09:06.220
You'd be the one that you wanted to be

09:06.220 --> 09:10.220
But at least I'm doing what I can tonight

09:10.220 --> 09:12.720
To watch it when it starts

09:12.720 --> 09:16.220
So I don't mind that it has got to

09:16.220 --> 09:18.720
To do the best that I can

09:18.720 --> 09:21.720
Do okay

09:21.720 --> 09:24.720
Do what I can

09:24.720 --> 09:26.720
I'm not getting out of here

09:26.720 --> 09:28.220
You turned away

09:28.220 --> 09:29.720
You're gonna see me

09:29.720 --> 09:32.220
And I won't let it in

09:32.220 --> 09:37.720
And if it isn't that I didn't even know you were falling in love

09:37.720 --> 09:43.220
I'm believing that you're missing me while you're standing with me alone

09:43.220 --> 10:11.220
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

10:11.220 --> 10:12.220
No!

10:12.220 --> 10:13.220
Do we show what people think of us?

10:13.220 --> 10:14.220
No!

10:14.220 --> 10:15.220
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

10:15.220 --> 10:16.220
Yes!

10:16.220 --> 10:32.620
Extreme Bimani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

10:32.620 --> 10:37.620
Hello and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio and that was some music from the new Popin

10:37.620 --> 10:38.620
Music Part 10.

10:38.620 --> 10:42.620
I can't believe that game has gotten that high, all the way to 10.

10:42.620 --> 10:45.620
That's more than I think any other Romani game has gotten yet.

10:45.620 --> 10:49.620
What is it about popin' music that makes it so damn popular?

10:49.620 --> 10:51.620
Any thoughts?

10:51.620 --> 10:54.620
Retards like to smash their heads against round buttons.

10:54.620 --> 10:55.620
Find a mic.

10:55.620 --> 10:56.620
Yeah, get a microphone.

10:56.620 --> 10:57.620
Look, you've already said it.

10:57.620 --> 10:59.620
Come on, say it again.

10:59.620 --> 11:04.620
Because retards like smashing their heads into large round buttons.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.620
I'm not quite sure why it's so popular.

11:06.620 --> 11:13.140
I guess maybe just the music is more popular over there than say 2DX's music seems to be

11:13.140 --> 11:17.180
more popular over here, from what my little sphere of influence.

11:17.180 --> 11:21.600
I personally, I don't know, since there's so much music in pop music, since there's

11:21.600 --> 11:26.060
ten versions now, plus the anime little ones, yeah there's a lot of good tracks, but overall

11:26.060 --> 11:31.700
I think the majority of the music isn't my style, whereas 2DX is more my type of thing,

11:31.700 --> 11:35.100
more of a dancey, techno, trancey...

11:35.100 --> 11:38.500
You and your rectangular buttons.

11:38.500 --> 11:41.500
Yeah, I know, not the big round tap light ones.

11:41.500 --> 11:45.100
Instead I've got little tiny like keys, you know.

11:45.100 --> 11:49.100
Well, your game doesn't have any characters dancing around.

11:49.100 --> 11:51.300
Well, in some of the videos it does.

11:51.300 --> 11:52.700
Ha! Some!

11:52.700 --> 11:54.300
Or as I have all of them.

11:54.300 --> 11:56.900
I think that's probably one of the points right there,

11:56.900 --> 11:58.600
the pop music thing.

11:58.600 --> 12:01.500
It's so marketable.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.500
I mean, there's hundreds of characters,

12:03.500 --> 12:08.500
for almost every single song ever made on it, and there's like 500 plus songs probably

12:08.500 --> 12:09.500
all made.

12:09.500 --> 12:10.920
I don't know, it's crazy.

12:10.920 --> 12:15.180
I was just looking at, Naby was over at a little gathering we were having last night,

12:15.180 --> 12:19.340
and Naby, who's been on the show before, he's kind of known as the local Papa Music whore,

12:19.340 --> 12:21.260
and he buys everything really into Papa Music.

12:21.260 --> 12:23.260
He bought this new Papa Music calendar.

12:23.260 --> 12:26.500
Okay, this new calendar is like the size of a small poster.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.660
It's not the size of your typical calendar, it's bigger.

12:28.660 --> 12:30.000
It's like the size of a small poster.

12:30.000 --> 12:35.640
a huge W.A.B. poster, but like a fold-out poster type thing. It's pretty big. And the

12:35.640 --> 12:39.280
cover of it has every single character from pop and music, and it's like looking at a

12:39.280 --> 12:43.040
Where's Waldo picture. Honestly, there's so many people just packed in there. It's kind

12:43.040 --> 12:46.720
of like, I want to find this one. I want to find the girl that looks like she's flicking

12:46.720 --> 12:50.760
her clit in that one song. And I'm looking, and it's like playing Where's Waldo. There's

12:50.760 --> 12:54.440
so damn many characters. And yes, I swear to God, there is a girl that looks like she's

12:54.440 --> 12:56.520
flicking her clit in one song. Just wanted to share.

12:56.520 --> 13:04.520
No, it's more like she's smoking out of her pussy. She keeps going like this. You know how people smoke? I'm doing the sign with the two fingers out like a peace sign. They're smoking.

13:04.520 --> 13:11.520
Except she's doing it from her, you know, under her skirt area, if you can imagine that. You on the radio side.

13:11.520 --> 13:21.520
The best, though, is the character Liddell, who is in, I believe it's pop music, 8? I think it's 7 or 8. I can't remember. But it's a song called Galaxy Forest. I think it's 8, too.

13:21.520 --> 13:26.840
No, you know what, I think it's seven because I think I've known of Liddell for a while.

13:26.840 --> 13:30.360
Okay, so I think it's one of the consumer tracks from seven is Galaxy Forest and there's

13:30.360 --> 13:34.420
this chick Liddell who looks like a sheep herder but with no face and just two little

13:34.420 --> 13:38.220
lighting eyes, so kind of like a black mage, like if you imagine Vivi, right?

13:38.220 --> 13:43.480
It's like Vivi is a sheep herder but a girl and she wears a skirt but if she loses, like

13:43.480 --> 13:47.140
rats fly out of her cooch.

13:47.140 --> 13:50.780
Like these rats drop from her skirt and scurry off.

13:50.780 --> 13:56.720
really disturbing like pop music has a lot of very disturbing trends of it like

13:56.720 --> 14:03.220
Donatello Versace that one part I can't stop you know bats flying out of my

14:03.220 --> 14:08.020
couch you're thinking that one Saturday Night Live with Donatello Versace in the

14:08.020 --> 14:14.040
backlight yes it was just like that okay it's time to end the show but I draw the

14:14.040 --> 14:18.040
with a line of bats flying out of my coach.

14:18.040 --> 14:20.040
Anyway, sorry.

14:20.040 --> 14:22.040
So I thought maybe we could go through these songs

14:22.040 --> 14:25.040
we just played and see what you guys think of them.

14:25.040 --> 14:27.040
We haven't really ever done that with new songs,

14:27.040 --> 14:29.040
but you know, we're desperate for material tonight.

14:29.040 --> 14:31.040
So let's see, what do you guys think of Mr. T

14:31.040 --> 14:32.040
with Goonies Are Good Enough?

14:32.040 --> 14:37.040
Crap!

14:37.040 --> 14:39.040
Crap, crap, crap, crap.

14:39.040 --> 14:41.040
You think this is crap?

14:41.040 --> 14:42.040
It is crap. You're crap.

14:42.040 --> 14:44.040
Let me just play some MIDI for you.

14:44.040 --> 14:47.040
We don't even do anything with it, we just play MIDI.

14:47.040 --> 14:49.040
Crap.

14:49.040 --> 14:51.040
Okay.

14:51.040 --> 14:53.040
That's your opinion.

14:53.040 --> 14:57.040
This song brings me back to my days when I was a little kid

14:57.040 --> 15:00.040
and used to play Gooey's 2 on Nintendo.

15:00.040 --> 15:03.040
Oh, it's awesome. I've always liked Mr. T,

15:03.040 --> 15:07.040
but he's been bringing out some cool stuff ever since, like,

15:07.040 --> 15:09.040
I don't know, Burning Heat and stuff like that.

15:09.040 --> 15:16.040
So good stuff. It just reminds me of like kind of like a kiriyama oka's feel of his little 8-bit sounding music and stuff

15:16.040 --> 15:19.020
I have a question for Loki. Do you consider this crap?

15:23.200 --> 15:24.600
Yes

15:24.600 --> 15:27.800
Wait a minute. You like this song. I've seen you play it before

15:28.960 --> 15:32.660
Yeah, like once ass you don't like that song

15:32.660 --> 15:37.860
song? So many Goonies are good enough, it's kind of like the next chapter. That song right

15:37.860 --> 15:43.020
there, that has actual synthesizers and stuff, and it actually looks like, you know, they

15:43.020 --> 15:48.380
spent more than two minutes on it, okay? Whereas the Goonies song is just like, oh, let's play

15:48.380 --> 15:53.700
it straight up Nintendo. And no, it wasn't hard for him to do that, all he did was just

15:53.700 --> 15:57.820
throw it into a MIDI player and go. Okay, here's my next question, what do you think

15:57.820 --> 16:04.820
of this

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
you gotta keep it

16:09.000 --> 16:16.000
keep it with those faggots

16:16.720 --> 16:23.720
well if you're gonna play a faggoty song anyways, at least play it so it sounds like a faggoty song instead of a faggoty 8-bit shit

16:25.240 --> 16:26.860
the opinions and

16:26.860 --> 16:30.580
But whatever, Loki, do not. Yeah, you get it.

16:30.580 --> 16:35.740
No, I don't care. I'm gay and I think it's funny.

16:35.740 --> 16:39.420
We all know Loki's tight with the queers.

16:39.420 --> 16:43.380
Last time we asked is queers. No, I love my goonies, okay?

16:43.380 --> 16:44.940
He's friendly

16:44.940 --> 16:47.740
with the queers. I love goonies. That movie rocks.

16:47.740 --> 16:52.860
And to totally take that song and just take a huge dump on it, it's just awful.

16:52.860 --> 16:56.580
Okay, but doesn't that song, isn't it even remotely retro to you?

16:56.580 --> 16:59.540
Didn't you ever play The Goonies 2 on Nintendo?

16:59.540 --> 17:01.860
No, it doesn't exist.

17:01.860 --> 17:02.860
For those that are-

17:02.860 --> 17:03.860
She turned into a fucking mermaid!

17:03.860 --> 17:06.340
Come on, it does not exist!

17:06.340 --> 17:11.180
For those that, um, I've read online that people think that that song is The Goonies

17:11.180 --> 17:12.940
2 song just lifted from the game.

17:12.940 --> 17:17.060
Okay, I hate to break it to you, but 8-Bit sounded a lot worse than that, so that has

17:17.060 --> 17:18.060
been redone.

17:18.060 --> 17:20.740
Now, to me, not enough in my opinion.

17:20.740 --> 17:21.740
Shut up.

17:21.740 --> 17:28.080
song is to Goonies 2, like Burning Heat was to Gradius 2. To me, that's just kind of the

17:28.080 --> 17:32.500
next chapter of the Burning Heat. It's taken another old school Konami theme and redoing

17:32.500 --> 17:37.680
it. So let's all hope to God that next Mr. T tackles Castlevania 2, because I would poop

17:37.680 --> 17:38.680
my pants.

17:38.680 --> 17:44.180
Oh my God. Here's the thing I've always been pissed off about. Akumaju Dracula immediately

17:44.180 --> 17:50.800
from, what is it, Keyboard Mania 2nd, is like already perfectly suited for Guitar Freaks

17:50.800 --> 17:53.800
and it never showed up.

17:53.800 --> 17:59.800
It's got the, you know, come on man, more Castlevania music in Bimani games, please.

17:59.800 --> 18:02.800
Or Gradius, or Goonies.

18:02.800 --> 18:05.800
Gradius was cool, the music in Gradius was cool.

18:05.800 --> 18:08.800
You know what, that's one thing I have to say I really like about Konami

18:08.800 --> 18:10.800
and that's one reason they're so well suited for DDR

18:10.800 --> 18:13.800
is that their music, typically, is pretty kick-ass.

18:13.800 --> 18:18.800
It's all classic, you know, I can, you can name off, like, any old Konami game

18:18.800 --> 18:29.800
and it's always got good music, even like, uh, what was that, uh, Roller Games, stupid rollerblading or, you know, roller derby type game that they made.

18:29.800 --> 18:36.800
Or yeah, Resh Attack or Metal Gear The Original, they always had pretty good music for like the hardware that they were putting it on.

18:36.800 --> 18:43.800
And yeah, Gradius' music was cool, even the 2DX songs are very good and stuff, but I want Castlevania music.

18:43.800 --> 18:48.800
And if you haven't played it yet, go play the new Castlevania, good stuff, get the soundtrack, it's awesome.

18:48.800 --> 18:51.800
Do they actually have a CD soundtrack for that?

18:51.800 --> 18:53.800
Uh, Japan will, we won't.

18:53.800 --> 18:58.800
Um, the game came out here in America first, and they're gonna release it over there like a month later,

18:58.800 --> 19:04.800
with a CD soundtrack and like tons of frickin collectibles and stuff, cause we don't get that cool stuff over here.

19:04.800 --> 19:07.800
Damn you, Konami of America.

19:07.800 --> 19:10.800
Yeah, here.

19:10.800 --> 19:15.800
We stupid Americans. We not good enough for collector edition.

19:40.800 --> 19:44.920
Let's go to the next song. This is um, I had to play this just because of the name alone

19:44.920 --> 19:48.680
This is a song called pata pata mama. This is the next song we played on that break

19:53.520 --> 19:55.520
What do you think of this one

19:56.560 --> 20:00.560
What do you think of this one now, we know why those school girls jumped in front of the train

20:00.560 --> 20:11.280
that bad huh? I think it's cute in a pop music way and only a way that pop music music can

20:11.280 --> 20:12.280
be that song is cute

20:12.280 --> 20:17.180
pop music belongs in the twilight zone because seriously it has like the worst music ever

20:17.180 --> 20:20.000
and then yet they keep releasing more sequels for it

20:20.000 --> 20:30.000
MURMUR TWINS

20:50.000 --> 20:55.000
the other one was. Yeah, I don't even know what the other one was. Screw that. But yeah,

20:55.000 --> 21:02.000
this is good. DJW is awesome. Murmur Twins, Spica, all the Linus, all the cool stuff he's

21:02.000 --> 21:06.780
done. Murmur Twins has probably always been my favorite of his, so this is pretty cool

21:06.780 --> 21:13.540
that they actually remixed it and such. Just don't do a trance remix of it ever, please.

21:13.540 --> 21:17.400
I imagine that'll probably fit in the next 2DX, because remember how Night Style was

21:17.400 --> 21:21.520
just like remix hell like everything was just remixed and the shit out of it in

21:21.520 --> 21:28.960
night style well I don't know I think DJ W's little forte is using kind of like

21:28.960 --> 21:34.040
keyboards and piano a lot almost like in a song of Kubota ish but not this

21:34.040 --> 21:37.640
classical sounding and so I don't think they would do like a trancy version

21:37.640 --> 21:41.600
really it would I don't know then again moon child is kind of different from his

21:41.600 --> 21:48.600
other stuff, so whatever.

22:11.600 --> 22:19.960
You know what, actually my mom and dad were going to give me an old car of theirs too

22:19.960 --> 22:25.160
when I got my license, only we had a big flood and it drowned.

22:25.160 --> 22:26.160
It drowned.

22:26.160 --> 22:27.160
The car drowned.

22:27.160 --> 22:28.160
Oh.

22:28.160 --> 22:30.280
Yeah, so I'm just bitter.

22:30.280 --> 22:31.280
Don't listen to me.

22:31.280 --> 22:33.920
Maybe you shouldn't have living cars anymore then.

22:33.920 --> 22:39.000
No, my car, it died and when you turn the key in it won't start anymore because there's

22:39.000 --> 22:41.200
mud everywhere.

22:41.200 --> 22:48.580
You shouldn't drive the car into the river again then.

22:48.580 --> 22:50.860
I did not drive the car into the river.

22:50.860 --> 22:59.320
My dad parked it near a creek, which is typical because there is a parking lot next to the

22:59.320 --> 23:00.320
creek.

23:00.320 --> 23:01.320
What do you do in the parking lot?

23:01.320 --> 23:02.320
You park your car.

23:02.320 --> 23:03.320
That's what he did.

23:03.320 --> 23:04.700
No, he did not park his car in the creek.

23:04.700 --> 23:07.860
He parked his car next to the creek and then it rained like what?

23:07.860 --> 23:11.140
eight inches in twenty four hours or something fucking crazy

23:11.140 --> 23:14.460
no this was in nineteen ninety five when california had those huge floods like

23:14.460 --> 23:16.300
president clinton came out here and everything

23:16.300 --> 23:18.620
and the car just floated away

23:18.620 --> 23:23.860
too bad the floods didn't sweep him away

23:23.860 --> 23:25.780
i cried but my car now is cool

23:25.780 --> 23:28.940
actually the the car was supposed to have was a ford explorer

23:28.940 --> 23:30.840
it was a ninety two ford explorer

23:30.840 --> 23:34.560
and my friend my friends and i always called it the jurassic park car because it was the same car

23:34.560 --> 23:36.440
they used in jurassic park and

23:36.440 --> 23:38.440
You know, we always used to get in the car and go...

23:38.440 --> 23:42.440
I know, we were dorks. What can I say?

23:42.440 --> 23:44.440
No, actually, it never got old.

23:44.440 --> 23:47.440
Kill yourself now. Awful.

23:55.440 --> 23:58.440
I hope a dinosaur eats you while you're on the crapper.

23:59.440 --> 24:02.440
Oh, Jurassic Park 4 was awesome.

24:02.440 --> 24:04.440
There was no Jurassic Park 4, yet.

24:04.440 --> 24:06.440
Yeah, there was no Jurassic Park board.

24:06.440 --> 24:08.440
That's what's so great about it.

24:08.440 --> 24:10.440
Yeah.

24:10.440 --> 24:14.440
They're making one so far.

24:14.440 --> 24:16.440
I know, I know.

24:16.440 --> 24:18.440
But I do, I miss my car.

24:18.440 --> 24:21.440
You know, whenever I think about my car, I get all nostalgic.

24:21.440 --> 24:29.440
Why do you have this?

24:29.440 --> 24:36.440
Are you a closet Jurassic Park fan? Do you like dinosaurs? Pink dinosaurs?

24:36.440 --> 24:38.440
No, I just happen to like John Williams.

24:38.440 --> 24:39.440
Welcome to ten years ago.

24:39.440 --> 24:42.440
I happen to like John Williams, is that so wrong?

24:42.440 --> 24:46.440
I reorganized my MP3 collection not too long ago.

24:46.440 --> 24:50.440
That's right, John Williams is one of the greatest composers ever.

24:50.440 --> 24:53.440
They are really making a Jurassic Park 4 though, you do know.

24:53.440 --> 24:56.440
You do know this, because Jurassic Park 3 did really, really well.

24:56.440 --> 24:58.440
So, of course, there will be a Jurassic Park 4.

24:58.440 --> 25:07.640
did well, I didn't know anybody who saw it. Really. I would only see it because William

25:07.640 --> 25:15.760
H. Macy is in it, that's all. What the hell? What is this showing? What is that? Are they

25:15.760 --> 25:20.060
See raccoons?

25:20.060 --> 25:29.980
Hold on, get this on the mic.

25:29.980 --> 25:31.320
Is this Satan worshipping?

25:31.320 --> 25:34.440
This is weird, it sounds like Silent Hill music.

25:34.440 --> 25:36.780
Excuse me.

25:36.780 --> 25:39.740
I'm dying.

25:39.740 --> 25:41.740
Too much nostalgia is bad for me.

25:41.740 --> 25:47.980
Anyway, why don't you post a link to that badger thing in the chat room, so if they...

25:47.980 --> 25:48.980
Oh, did they get...

25:48.980 --> 25:49.980
Oh, okay.

25:49.980 --> 25:50.980
Oh, somebody else put it in there.

25:50.980 --> 25:51.980
I see.

25:51.980 --> 25:52.980
I see.

25:52.980 --> 25:53.980
Okay.

25:53.980 --> 25:54.980
Oh, I see what happened.

25:54.980 --> 25:55.980
It's all Wampa's fault.

25:55.980 --> 25:56.980
I get it.

25:56.980 --> 25:57.980
All right.

25:57.980 --> 26:01.940
Do the badgers ever do anything other than just stand there and dance?

26:01.940 --> 26:02.940
No, they just badger.

26:02.940 --> 26:03.940
Oh, they just badger.

26:03.940 --> 26:04.940
That's cute.

26:04.940 --> 26:05.940
That's cute.

26:05.940 --> 26:06.940
Random snake.

26:06.940 --> 26:07.940
Random snake.

26:07.940 --> 26:08.940
That's good.

26:08.940 --> 26:09.940
Random Snake.

26:09.940 --> 26:10.940
That's good.

26:10.940 --> 26:11.940
Okay.

26:11.940 --> 26:16.300
Now this is a part of the show where we usually like to kick off the show with this, but you

26:16.300 --> 26:17.300
know, we're a little late tonight.

26:17.300 --> 26:18.300
Oh, well.

26:18.300 --> 26:21.860
I thought we'd play a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.

26:21.860 --> 26:25.100
This is the part of the show where we go around and ask everybody, how was your week, how

26:25.100 --> 26:28.660
was your day, Loki?

26:28.660 --> 26:37.120
How was your week, how was your day?

26:37.120 --> 26:43.400
I think that mic is off, Logie.

26:43.400 --> 26:49.640
I think you're disconnected then, because I'm not hearing it.

26:49.640 --> 26:52.840
Damn you. There we go. All right. How was your week? How was your day, Logie?

26:52.840 --> 26:55.160
I had bacon grease in my hands.

26:55.160 --> 26:58.400
Anyways, um...

26:58.400 --> 27:02.360
Let's see. The only thing worth mentioning this week is I went and saw Matrix Revolutions.

27:02.360 --> 27:05.320
It was okay. It was good.

27:05.320 --> 27:08.360
And I went and saw Elf yesterday.

27:08.360 --> 27:09.720
That was good.

27:09.720 --> 27:14.240
And it looks like a movie that's going to be really manipulative,

27:14.240 --> 27:14.760
though.

27:14.760 --> 27:17.240
It's going to have one of those crybaby endings, and like,

27:17.240 --> 27:19.480
family, feel good, family fun.

27:19.480 --> 27:20.240
OK.

27:20.240 --> 27:23.440
I don't know what it is with people making Christmas movies

27:23.440 --> 27:26.360
and thinking that at the end of every Christmas movie

27:26.360 --> 27:29.240
has to be, for some reason, you have to get the Christmas spirit

27:29.240 --> 27:30.800
and then everything is message.

27:30.800 --> 27:34.080
It's like, the whole movie was good until they threw out, like,

27:34.080 --> 27:41.080
Oh, everyone must believe in Santa or else Christmas will not be saved!

27:41.080 --> 27:45.160
You know, it's just so awful that they do stuff like that, but the rest of the movie

27:45.160 --> 27:46.160
is awesome.

27:46.160 --> 27:49.680
Yeah, why don't they make movies about real life, you know, like some people don't get

27:49.680 --> 27:53.600
to have Christmas because they're so poor and they don't get to eat like once a week

27:53.600 --> 27:57.080
and stuff, and you know, that's a nice uplifting Christmas story.

27:57.080 --> 27:59.080
I like it, they had a part in it.

27:59.080 --> 28:01.080
Okay, what about the Jews?

28:01.080 --> 28:02.080
I don't know.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.080
We'll go see the movie.

28:03.080 --> 28:07.080
They had a part in the movie, though, where he's talking to Santa.

28:07.080 --> 28:10.080
He's like, there's been rumors going around

28:10.080 --> 28:13.080
that parents are telling their children,

28:13.080 --> 28:16.080
or that people are believing that their parents are putting

28:16.080 --> 28:19.080
the presents under the tree, and they're all,

28:19.080 --> 28:20.080
how is that possible?

28:20.080 --> 28:23.080
How would they even be able to do that in one night?

28:23.080 --> 28:24.080
He's like, I know.

28:24.080 --> 28:26.080
And they're all, then what about the cookies?

28:26.080 --> 28:28.080
Do they think that they eat the cookies, too?

28:28.080 --> 28:29.080
I guess so.

28:29.080 --> 28:32.080
They just said it so sarcastically, it was funny.

28:32.080 --> 28:36.140
Because there was no Santa Claus!

28:36.140 --> 28:39.300
Thank you, thank you, Loki, ruining Christmas everywhere.

28:39.300 --> 28:44.220
I'm not gonna go and let my kids believe that there's this fake Santa Claus or Easter Bunny.

28:44.220 --> 28:48.140
I'm gonna let them, I'm gonna make it a little more realistic for them.

28:48.140 --> 28:51.660
That mom and dad have to take out another loan on the house because you want your fucking

28:51.660 --> 28:54.460
presents you little brats.

28:54.460 --> 28:58.060
This is a fun little side topic, I want to pose this question to everybody in here.

28:58.060 --> 29:03.060
How old were you when you found out there was no Santa Claus, and how did you react?

29:03.060 --> 29:07.060
Loki, how old were you when you found out there was no Santa Claus and how did you react?

29:07.060 --> 29:12.060
Oh damn, I don't even remember. I just don't think I cared, so I was getting presents anyways.

29:12.060 --> 29:15.060
But, um, I don't know.

29:15.060 --> 29:17.060
Alright, bad.

29:17.060 --> 29:22.820
I think it was like four or five, you know, as far as I can remember, and I reacted pretty

29:22.820 --> 29:23.820
well.

29:23.820 --> 29:29.380
I was like, oh, cool, a new four-in-a-row hidden in my mom's closet.

29:29.380 --> 29:30.380
So I took it pretty well.

29:30.380 --> 29:31.380
Vandalous?

29:31.380 --> 29:35.140
What are you guys talking about?

29:35.140 --> 29:36.140
There's no Santa Claus.

29:36.140 --> 29:37.140
What are you talking about, man?

29:37.140 --> 29:42.140
I know it's like a big joke, isn't it?

29:42.140 --> 29:43.380
Yeah, it's a joke.

29:43.380 --> 29:44.380
That's what we do on the radio.

29:44.380 --> 29:45.380
We kid.

29:45.380 --> 29:46.380
I kid.

29:46.380 --> 29:50.520
Anyways, I actually found out because my parents told me they got tired of trying to play it

29:50.520 --> 29:53.840
off like there was, and so they said, hey, you know what, we just put the presents under

29:53.840 --> 29:55.840
the tree for you.

29:55.840 --> 29:58.400
So I'm kind of jaded about that kind of thing.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.900
So that's why my kids don't think there's a Santa Claus either, because that's all kind

30:00.900 --> 30:02.920
of, he's a silly little red elf.

30:02.920 --> 30:08.960
I was about to say, since you actually have kids who are the age where they could, they're

30:08.960 --> 30:13.560
not babies, they're toddlers now, and they're thinking about Santa Claus and all that, did

30:13.560 --> 30:17.040
you try the Santa Claus thing with him or did you just say, screw it, you know what

30:17.040 --> 30:21.280
kids, I'm going to tell you a secret, the other kids are going to try to feed you the

30:21.280 --> 30:22.280
Santa crap?

30:22.280 --> 30:27.680
That's pretty essentially it, we told them, you know, he's a funny little elf, who just,

30:27.680 --> 30:33.080
people look like him at the malls, he doesn't do anything for you, and we just go ahead

30:33.080 --> 30:35.760
and let them know we give him the presents and things like that.

30:35.760 --> 30:39.040
Same with the Easter Bunny, same with the Tooth Fairy.

30:39.040 --> 30:46.040
All he does is beg for money to give to the Red Cross, that greedy bastard.

30:46.040 --> 30:50.080
Will, I know you're the youngest one here, but the news has been broken, yes?

30:50.080 --> 30:51.080
I'm just kidding.

30:51.080 --> 30:52.080
I'm kidding.

30:52.080 --> 30:53.080
Of course.

30:53.080 --> 30:54.080
How old were you and how did you react?

30:54.080 --> 30:55.080
I don't know.

30:55.080 --> 30:57.920
I was probably like nine or ten.

30:57.920 --> 30:59.920
I can't really remember.

30:59.920 --> 31:01.480
Oh, presents.

31:01.480 --> 31:06.400
You didn't care because you were still getting presents?

31:06.400 --> 31:07.400
Yeah.

31:07.400 --> 31:08.400
It wasn't a huge shock.

31:08.400 --> 31:13.400
I mean, by that age it's not very believable anymore, anyways.

31:13.400 --> 31:15.400
I see.

31:15.400 --> 31:18.400
The logistics of it just is what clued me in on it.

31:18.400 --> 31:23.400
I'm like, how can a fat fuck fit down this goddamn chimney anyways?

31:23.400 --> 31:25.400
Oh, he uses his magic powers.

31:25.400 --> 31:26.400
Oh, yeah, magic powers.

31:26.400 --> 31:29.400
Isn't that convenient?

31:29.400 --> 31:32.400
All right, Bradley, want to share?

31:32.400 --> 31:33.400
I don't really remember.

31:33.400 --> 31:36.400
It was probably around five or six, maybe.

31:36.400 --> 31:41.160
My sister told me and I said, oh, okay.

31:41.160 --> 31:44.200
I don't think I was really shocked.

31:44.200 --> 31:48.880
That sounds very like you, Bradley, where you just would have been, oh, okay.

31:48.880 --> 31:50.120
I'm kind of surprised by that.

31:50.120 --> 31:55.480
You didn't become emotional?

31:55.480 --> 31:59.880
I was five years old when I found out because my mom just started putting the presents under

31:59.880 --> 32:04.440
the tree that said, from Santa, under the tree on the 23rd because she was just getting

32:04.440 --> 32:06.080
lazy and she didn't want to play the game anymore.

32:06.080 --> 32:08.200
I was kind of like, why does Santa and you

32:08.200 --> 32:10.240
have the same handwriting?

32:10.240 --> 32:11.560
And she'd just ignore me.

32:11.560 --> 32:13.960
How come the presents are under the tray on the 23rd?

32:13.960 --> 32:15.400
How come the cookies are still gone

32:15.400 --> 32:17.080
and we have to leave them out on the 24th?

32:17.080 --> 32:19.880
How come the reindeer hooves look just like the rabbit hooves?

32:19.880 --> 32:21.760
Because I was totally that kind of kid,

32:21.760 --> 32:23.960
where whenever anybody would try to tell me something,

32:23.960 --> 32:26.200
I'd be all, why, why, why?

32:26.200 --> 32:29.800
I was that annoying little shit.

32:29.800 --> 32:30.640
One note I did.

32:30.640 --> 32:31.760
Why?

32:31.760 --> 32:35.480
I was real into spying and all that cool shit.

32:35.480 --> 32:42.240
So what I had is I had ultraviolet pens, and I marked all the packages that were hidden

32:42.240 --> 32:47.240
in the closet to prove or not if they were from Santa or whatever, because they weren't

32:47.240 --> 32:50.760
marked who they were for or who they were from, so you get the from Santa ones and you

32:50.760 --> 32:53.560
take my little ultraviolet light and you're like, HA!

32:53.560 --> 32:54.560
HA!

32:54.560 --> 32:55.560
You tried to trick me?

32:55.560 --> 32:57.560
Ah, you saw right through it.

32:57.560 --> 32:59.560
Low-key, ever-the-conspiracy-theorist.

32:59.560 --> 33:03.820
Oh my God.

33:03.820 --> 33:10.440
My parents used to leave the tags on the presents because they wanted to be able to return them.

33:10.440 --> 33:15.320
When I saw that Santa Claus shopped at the commissary on base, wow, he really saved some

33:15.320 --> 33:16.320
money doing that.

33:16.320 --> 33:17.780
I thought he made them.

33:17.780 --> 33:20.040
That's a nice revelation there.

33:20.040 --> 33:21.040
Santa's military.

33:21.040 --> 33:22.040
I didn't know that.

33:22.040 --> 33:25.680
What a nice sweater from Santa.

33:25.680 --> 33:28.780
I didn't know Santa's workshop was called Mervin's.

33:28.780 --> 33:36.660
kostjamrh And why isn't Santa contributing to the US economy? If he's using all this

33:36.660 --> 33:42.860
elf labor and stuff, do they have unions? Because he's making a lot of knock-off goods and stuff

33:42.860 --> 33:45.140
and selling them, calling them name-brand.

33:45.140 --> 33:52.140
p0k3smot42o you can't find a fucking place to park at the north pole on a saturday

34:15.140 --> 34:16.140
Thanks to piracy!

34:16.140 --> 34:23.220
Thanks to piracy, because all those methods that they put watermarking the god damn film

34:23.220 --> 34:28.220
and checking people's bags and stuff, you can see it's totally put a stop to piracy.

34:28.220 --> 34:31.160
You know what, it's one of those things where I wanted to try it before I buy it, and I

34:31.160 --> 34:35.420
tried it, and I've decided, you know what, I think I'll just watch the other half at

34:35.420 --> 34:36.420
home.

34:36.420 --> 34:41.820
You know, here's what it is, it's like, I'm sorry, I don't want to go to the theater and

34:41.820 --> 34:48.120
pay $18 every time I go see a movie. I'm going to watch it once in the theater, so I remember.

34:48.120 --> 35:01.300
You pay for your date? Yeah. Wow. You guys are going to hell. You're stealing from people

35:01.300 --> 35:06.920
who work hard to give you this stuff and you're just like, stealing it. You know what, I saw

35:06.920 --> 35:11.120
Kill Bill three times in the theater to make up for it, so... But that place is not going

35:11.120 --> 35:18.120
to the Wachowski Brothers, or Warner Brothers Entertainment for Warner Brothers.

35:19.080 --> 35:24.000
They've made almost $1 billion on the franchise. They can go to hell. I don't really care.

35:24.000 --> 35:29.000
And they spent about $1 billion making the second and third movies.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.880
Think of all the starving children that could have fed.

35:32.880 --> 35:36.940
yeah like Keanu Reeves

35:36.940 --> 35:39.820
yeah I think of all the acting classes he could have gone into his own

35:39.820 --> 35:42.120
oh that's funny

35:42.120 --> 35:46.080
well if anything I want to see the Wachowski brothers take on Bill and Ted three

35:46.080 --> 35:47.080
okay

35:47.080 --> 35:48.380
that's what they need to make

35:48.380 --> 35:50.020
that's all that he's good at

35:50.020 --> 35:53.880
just bring it back, bring it back to old school

35:53.880 --> 35:55.560
yeah seriously just have it like

35:55.560 --> 35:58.440
Bill and Ted do something you know

35:58.440 --> 35:59.760
three

35:59.760 --> 36:02.600
but anyways um...

36:02.600 --> 36:07.460
So what else did I do? Oh, I made two more remixes. The only one was tonight. And I did

36:07.460 --> 36:14.500
a live show last night, an impromptu livewire show at like one in the morning. And that

36:14.500 --> 36:19.980
was cool because I was bored. And I took the chat room and then thinking I was a person

36:19.980 --> 36:23.320
called Death By Syrup from Canada.

36:23.320 --> 36:26.460
And they should have known right there that that was your super bacon right there. Because

36:26.460 --> 36:28.300
that was the bacon you made tonight, right?

36:28.300 --> 36:34.220
No, well, I got the syrup idea from seeing Elf because he, like, would drink syrup, so...

36:34.220 --> 36:38.980
No, that's good. Syrup shots, man, I want to do some of those.

36:38.980 --> 36:44.340
Oh my God, we did that at, um, in LA. Yeah, we went to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.

36:44.340 --> 36:48.220
It was right after Cyber Zone, the big tournament there. A bunch of us went over to Roscoe's

36:48.220 --> 36:53.420
Chicken and Waffle, and, uh, it was like, what, me, Brad, Irene, Mel B, who else was

36:53.420 --> 36:57.100
at our table? Tons of, uh, Bay Area people. But it was mostly our table that did the syrup

36:57.100 --> 37:07.460
You, me, Irene, Fury, Wendell, Mandy, they give you these little shot glasses full of

37:07.460 --> 37:11.660
syrup and warm syrup to put on your waffles and chicken.

37:11.660 --> 37:13.340
Nice warm gooey bottle of soup.

37:13.340 --> 37:17.900
The thing is, since it's warm, if you've ever cooked soup or something that's thick, when

37:17.900 --> 37:22.240
you're heating it up, it starts to create a film on top, like it's kind of hard.

37:22.240 --> 37:25.780
That's what happened to this syrup, so you had the nice little, it's almost like a tequila

37:55.780 --> 38:02.780
a Loki so he can finish telling us about his weakness day.

38:25.780 --> 38:32.780
in

38:33.420 --> 38:34.420
yeah

38:34.420 --> 38:36.500
that's it i'm done

38:36.500 --> 38:39.740
all right uh... i guess i'll ask brad since you know he kept putting in on

38:39.740 --> 38:43.100
that last one how are you how's your day you already know

38:43.100 --> 38:46.860
but listeners don't like they care okman

38:46.860 --> 38:50.900
i went out and last week i believe it was one hour and

38:50.900 --> 38:53.740
use my wonderful city critic card and bought

38:53.740 --> 38:57.740
a PS2, an American one, because I haven't had one for the longest time, I only had a Japanese one.

38:57.740 --> 39:03.740
So I got that, and Castlevania, because I was fiending, I had to finish Castlevania, because I've been bumming it off of you guys here.

39:03.740 --> 39:04.740
I want to loan it to me.

39:04.740 --> 39:08.740
That's alright, I had to buy it. Matt's saying he'd loan it to me, but that's fine.

39:08.740 --> 39:16.740
So I bought it, and finished it up, I beat it pretty much every different way you can, except for crazy mode, because it's crazy and whatnot.

39:16.740 --> 39:27.740
I beat it with the two hidden characters, like four hours is all it took me to beat it with the second hidden character, and three hours is all it took me for the first hidden character. You can go through it so freaking fast.

39:27.740 --> 39:36.740
Anyhow, so, got that. I've got a job interview tomorrow, so I will have a life for once! Finally! Yay for me!

39:36.740 --> 39:38.740
Congratulations.

39:38.740 --> 39:40.880
Yeah, I'm gonna work for the man, so

39:41.860 --> 39:44.040
And that's pretty much it we had

39:45.080 --> 39:47.080
friend over from

39:47.200 --> 39:54.960
Old-school friend over for you know the weekend and watched movies and and you got the strangers with candy DVDs, so we watched that

39:55.720 --> 39:57.720
You know oh my god

39:58.320 --> 40:00.920
Please I this is my highest recommendation

40:00.920 --> 40:06.440
I could ever give a DVD go out and buy the strangers with candy season 1 and season 2 box sets

40:06.440 --> 40:09.440
I almost peed my pants at that episode we watched last night.

40:09.440 --> 40:12.440
Oh my god, that was one of the most disturbing things I've done before.

40:12.440 --> 40:15.440
It was the most morbid thing I think I've ever seen on a broadcast television show.

40:15.440 --> 40:17.440
Well, it's cable, whatever, basic cable.

40:17.440 --> 40:18.440
But still.

40:18.440 --> 40:20.440
It was great. It was great.

40:20.440 --> 40:25.440
I don't even want to describe it because I don't want to ruin it, but one of the funniest shows I've ever seen.

40:25.440 --> 40:28.440
Strainers of Candy. Go buy the first episode.

40:28.440 --> 40:32.440
We'll watch it after tonight's show. We'll watch that episode because it's just great.

40:32.440 --> 40:36.680
I had to go to the bathroom from laughing so hard after the ending of that one.

40:36.680 --> 40:41.200
Yeah, it was like two or three in the morning, and you're like waking up our neighbor.

40:41.200 --> 40:46.600
I have an infectious laugh, what can I say?

40:46.600 --> 40:49.760
Eddie was pretty loud too when he laughed, though.

40:49.760 --> 40:50.760
I love Eddie's laugh.

40:50.760 --> 40:51.760
I'm sure we'll talk about this later.

40:51.760 --> 40:54.240
I wish Eddie was here tonight so I can make him laugh so you guys could hear, because

40:54.240 --> 40:55.240
I love his laugh.

40:55.240 --> 40:59.440
I'm sure we'll talk about this later, but we also sang karaoke.

40:59.440 --> 41:00.440
Yeah, we'll get to that.

41:00.440 --> 41:01.440
We'll get to that.

41:01.440 --> 41:03.440
Yeah, well, that's a good topic right there.

41:03.440 --> 41:04.440
Next, next segment, we'll get to that.

41:04.440 --> 41:05.440
Yes.

41:05.440 --> 41:06.440
I'm awful.

41:06.440 --> 41:07.440
So am I, but anyway.

41:07.440 --> 41:08.440
Okay.

41:08.440 --> 41:10.440
Anything else you want to say about your weekend weekend?

41:10.440 --> 41:15.440
Um, I started playing Final Fantasy X because I am way freaking behind.

41:15.440 --> 41:18.440
All you people who have played it already, good for you.

41:18.440 --> 41:19.440
So.

41:19.440 --> 41:20.440
I, I quit.

41:20.440 --> 41:21.440
Final Fantasy XI's taken over.

41:21.440 --> 41:23.440
I can't go back to Final Fantasy X now.

41:23.440 --> 41:24.440
Yeah.

41:24.440 --> 41:27.440
Hey, if I had Final Fantasy XI, I'd be playing that too, so.

41:27.440 --> 41:30.440
But I don't, because I've got no money, so I'll just play Final Fantasy X.

41:30.440 --> 41:36.720
10 until I beat it. Good stuff. And then I got to pick Kingdom Hearts, because I'm way

41:36.720 --> 41:37.720
behind on that too.

41:37.720 --> 41:40.160
Remind me, I've got to give that to you before you go.

41:40.160 --> 41:41.160
Yes, give it to me.

41:41.160 --> 41:42.160
Give it to me now!

41:42.160 --> 41:43.160
Give it to me in the butt.

41:43.160 --> 41:44.160
Ew.

41:44.160 --> 41:45.160
Anyway.

41:45.160 --> 41:46.160
Okay.

41:46.160 --> 41:48.040
Stick your keyblade in my butt.

41:48.040 --> 41:52.920
Anyway, is that it?

41:52.920 --> 41:55.800
What else happened? Did we do anything else?

41:55.800 --> 42:00.080
Not that I remember. I mean, we didn't do Vanilla Sky this week. We took a week off

42:00.080 --> 42:04.880
of vanilla sky and by the way on a rerun of vanilla sky had our highest listener count

42:04.880 --> 42:09.340
ever on the show and it wasn't even on the right night that's why i know jamie's show

42:09.340 --> 42:13.600
whoops mine in the ratings because we moved to tuesday for a night through the roof there's

42:13.600 --> 42:18.560
a little ego stroking for jamie yeah jamie if you're out there listening wait is somebody

42:18.560 --> 42:24.280
asking me um if i'm gonna play x2 or is somebody asking somebody else um well let's let's pretend

42:24.280 --> 42:28.680
they're asking you that you want to play phone se x2 i was not interested at all when i saw

42:28.680 --> 42:31.760
I saw this, I was like, what the hell, let's just make the three main characters girls

42:31.760 --> 42:34.080
that dress weirdly and stuff.

42:34.080 --> 42:37.200
But after reading about it and how they're going to have a job system and stuff like

42:37.200 --> 42:38.520
that, it sounds interesting.

42:38.520 --> 42:42.520
I still, since I haven't gone through Final Fantasy X yet, I don't understand what the

42:42.520 --> 42:46.000
connection is, but I noticed a lot of the characters are missing from Final Fantasy

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
X.

42:47.000 --> 42:51.360
Yeah, and they can kiss my bad ass for not having Lulu a playable character.

42:51.360 --> 42:53.760
Well Lulu's going to be in it, but she's not a playable character.

42:53.760 --> 42:54.760
Fuck that.

42:54.760 --> 42:56.280
What I'm pissed off is, where's Oren?

42:56.280 --> 43:00.780
And don't say, I know people are probably going to sit there in the chat room and spoil

43:00.780 --> 43:02.780
it for me, because you guys all suck.

43:02.780 --> 43:07.440
Yeah, remember, Brad and I have not beat Final Fantasy X yet, I've picked up on some things

43:07.440 --> 43:10.480
that might be happening, but let's not spoil, okay?

43:10.480 --> 43:11.480
I don't know.

43:11.480 --> 43:13.200
So I will play it, if you were asking me.

43:13.200 --> 43:15.160
If you weren't asking me, I don't fucking care.

43:15.160 --> 43:16.160
Fuck you.

43:16.160 --> 43:18.160
I'll tell you my opinion anyway.

43:18.160 --> 43:19.160
Sorry.

43:19.160 --> 43:21.840
I'm really not this angsty and all that, but it's okay.

43:21.840 --> 43:22.840
No, you are.

43:22.840 --> 43:23.840
Fuck you!

43:23.840 --> 43:24.840
See?

43:24.840 --> 43:25.840
Please.

43:25.840 --> 43:35.840
Alright, Will, how you doing? Slinky wizard? Are you still slinky wizard, or just slinky

43:35.840 --> 43:36.840
now?

43:36.840 --> 43:37.840
Whatever.

43:37.840 --> 43:42.840
Such an apathetic little teen you are, go ahead.

43:42.840 --> 43:44.840
I don't care anymore, it doesn't matter.

43:44.840 --> 43:47.840
Will, how was your week, how was your day?

43:47.840 --> 43:53.840
Well, high school. Yeah, high school is high school, and high school sucks.

43:53.840 --> 43:59.760
And, you know, on Tuesday I got my license, barely.

43:59.760 --> 44:00.760
Missed 11.

44:00.760 --> 44:01.760
Oh yeah.

44:01.760 --> 44:05.880
Hey, what score is that, 89?

44:05.880 --> 44:08.720
I think the most you miss is like 13 or 15.

44:08.720 --> 44:09.720
Oh.

44:09.720 --> 44:10.720
Yeah.

44:10.720 --> 44:12.720
Wait, on the written test?

44:12.720 --> 44:14.240
The driving test.

44:14.240 --> 44:15.240
Really?

44:15.240 --> 44:16.240
God.

44:16.240 --> 44:19.640
You used to be able to get a 70 and still pass because I got an 80.

44:19.640 --> 44:20.640
Yeah.

44:20.640 --> 44:23.140
They're evil.

44:23.140 --> 44:25.980
I got a B- in driving.

44:25.980 --> 44:27.660
I got like a 70.

44:27.660 --> 44:29.140
I got like the lowest you can get.

44:29.140 --> 44:30.820
Here's what happened.

44:30.820 --> 44:33.500
I got a, let's see how we did this.

44:33.500 --> 44:35.780
I got knocked off probably four points.

44:35.780 --> 44:38.180
I probably would have had like a 90-something.

44:38.180 --> 44:40.700
And I finished the entire test, and I parked.

44:40.700 --> 44:41.660
And I parked like shit.

44:41.660 --> 44:43.060
I parked all crooked and stuff.

44:43.060 --> 44:44.520
And I didn't take any points off that.

44:44.520 --> 44:46.820
And we're right about to go inside and get my license,

44:46.820 --> 44:48.620
because I got like a 90-something percent.

44:48.620 --> 44:51.380
And he's like, actually, you didn't move your head enough.

44:51.380 --> 44:54.380
and then knocks off like 20 points. I was like...

44:54.380 --> 44:57.380
Was he just mad because you weren't moving your head up and down his crotch?

44:57.380 --> 45:00.380
I wasn't moving my head like this, and this is only for the people in the studio because

45:00.380 --> 45:02.380
you guys, you know, over there can't hear it.

45:02.380 --> 45:03.380
You can kind of see on the cam.

45:03.380 --> 45:07.380
But I was moving my head like this because you have to look, you know, you have to look

45:07.380 --> 45:11.380
down a street when you drive through an intersection, you need to look down both sides. I was moving

45:11.380 --> 45:18.380
my head like this. He wanted me to move my head like this. You know, apparently, and...

45:18.380 --> 45:20.380
Did you take it at Florin or something?

45:20.380 --> 45:22.380
Did you take it at Lauren Mall?

46:20.380 --> 46:27.380
weekend, and trying to cause trouble, and stuff like that. So, fun stuff.

46:28.380 --> 46:31.380
Alright. That's about it.

46:31.380 --> 46:34.380
Alright, cool deal. Have you played AMDDR at all lately?

46:34.380 --> 46:41.380
I know I haven't. No, actually, no. We went on Thursday, and I did play two games. I'm

46:41.380 --> 46:45.380
working on my doubles. For some reason, I'm in this mood where, like, I have to play doubles.

46:45.380 --> 46:47.380
But enough about me. What about you?

46:47.380 --> 46:52.380
Yeah, I went Saturday morning, just for the hell of it.

46:52.380 --> 46:57.380
Yeah, I haven't been in a while, so I was sore.

46:57.380 --> 47:02.380
Do you find that when you haven't played in a while, like when you start playing those caddos back to back, you're like...

47:02.380 --> 47:03.380
Yeah.

47:03.380 --> 47:04.380
Because that's me.

47:04.380 --> 47:05.380
Smoker.

47:05.380 --> 47:06.380
Smokers.

47:06.380 --> 47:07.380
Well...

47:07.380 --> 47:08.380
Yeah.

47:08.380 --> 47:09.380
Did you take up smoking?

47:09.380 --> 47:10.380
No.

47:10.380 --> 47:11.380
Oh, okay.

47:11.380 --> 47:12.380
I would compare it to that.

47:12.380 --> 47:13.380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:13.380 --> 47:14.380
Something like that.

47:14.380 --> 47:15.380
And then if you are a smoker, it's like twice as bad.

47:15.380 --> 47:32.700
I see Terry sitting on the computer, so I'll go to Bradley, if we can get a mic over to

47:32.700 --> 47:36.420
Bradley. Can we get a mic over to Bradley? Bradley, how was your week and how was your

47:36.420 --> 47:47.700
your day? Mostly blah, of course, as usual. Monday was not much. Tuesday I called a temp

47:47.700 --> 47:56.820
agency and set up an appointment. Wednesday I did more crap. Thursday I went to this temp

47:56.820 --> 48:02.780
agency, basically an accounting-type temp agency, maybe find a data entry job or something

48:02.780 --> 48:08.540
of that sort. I did well enough on their excel test. He basically gave me the advanced accounting

48:08.540 --> 48:14.340
test instead of the basic one they were supposed to give me. I did well enough on that even

48:14.340 --> 48:20.000
though I had studied accounting terms the day before. He also gave me an excel test

48:20.000 --> 48:24.220
so he said, hey, you did well enough on this. Why don't you go take the certification? So

48:24.220 --> 48:31.100
I took that and passed that. So we certified down for the general, like the specialist

48:31.100 --> 48:38.000
And then Friday I didn't do much of anything. I set up eBay auctions and such. Then Saturday

48:38.000 --> 48:51.500
I went and saw The Matrix and Davis and watched The Matrix. I was sort of just sitting there

48:51.500 --> 48:56.160
watching it. I don't know if I was really paying attention to it. I was just like, ooh,

48:56.160 --> 49:02.900
pretty things, like ships flying around. The action scenes are good, but the dialogue scenes

49:02.900 --> 49:10.820
are kind of stupid. So, I sort of liked it and sort of didn't like it. And then today,

49:10.820 --> 49:12.980
more crap. And that's basically everything.

49:12.980 --> 49:22.740
Let's go over to Terry and see how your week was.

49:22.740 --> 49:27.260
Hello, my week has been very busy.

49:27.260 --> 49:31.180
Hey look, there's boobies on the web cam.

49:31.180 --> 49:32.460
Boobies on cam!

49:32.460 --> 49:37.340
And how that's possible when there's no women here tonight, I have no idea, but go ahead.

49:37.340 --> 49:39.340
Brad stop showing the boobies.

49:39.340 --> 49:42.260
Okay, I've been very busy at work.

49:42.260 --> 49:51.580
I'm going to bore you guys on my work, bullcrap, because that's what I'm dealing with is hiring

49:51.580 --> 49:57.860
new people and being in a new organization and fun stuff like that.

49:57.860 --> 50:04.980
I watched Matrix Revolutions, if you don't see my LJ, which is Vandalous.LiveJournal.com.

50:04.980 --> 50:05.980
Oh, nice plug.

50:05.980 --> 50:06.980
Hey, thank you.

50:06.980 --> 50:10.860
And that is, we watched IMAX, or Revolutions on IMAX.

50:10.860 --> 50:12.540
Ah, how was that?

50:12.540 --> 50:15.260
It was freaking unbelievable.

50:15.260 --> 50:16.260
I bet.

50:16.260 --> 50:18.740
I bet even a shit movie would be great on IMAX.

50:18.740 --> 50:23.740
The Defense of Zion, if you've seen this movie and you watch it on a regular show, on a regular

50:23.740 --> 50:26.280
screen, and you go watch it on IMAX, it just blows you away.

50:26.280 --> 50:28.820
The Defense of Zion is unbelievable on that screen.

50:28.820 --> 50:29.820
I bet.

50:29.820 --> 50:35.700
Anyways, the other kind of cool thing about going down there was, we had one of my friends'

50:35.700 --> 50:39.300
roommates go with us, and he's a guy that'll do anything if you start giving him a little

50:39.300 --> 50:40.300
alcohol.

50:40.300 --> 50:41.300
Oh goody.

50:41.300 --> 50:46.380
And so, this guy's about 240 pounds, about 5'7", he's got about the geekiest glasses

50:46.380 --> 50:53.340
you can find, and they got him to take two triple shots of tequila, and so his ears were

50:53.340 --> 50:54.340
pretty red.

50:54.340 --> 50:58.620
Of course he's over 21 and all that, this is completely legal.

50:58.620 --> 51:02.340
And he proceeded to, they convinced him to take off his shirt.

51:02.340 --> 51:03.340
This is Gordon Biersch.

51:03.340 --> 51:04.340
Oh my!

51:04.340 --> 51:05.340
You know where Gordon Biersch is?

51:05.340 --> 51:06.340
On San Francisco.

51:06.340 --> 51:12.300
It's right on the corner from Barcadero and Harrison, which is right by the piers.

51:12.300 --> 51:16.580
And we took a box out of a trash can, he took off his shirt and proceeded to belly flop

51:16.580 --> 51:17.580
it for us.

51:17.580 --> 51:24.940
There was a nice light rail going by, it was about 3 o'clock in the afternoon in San Francisco

51:24.940 --> 51:28.180
on a Wednesday.

51:28.180 --> 51:32.340
And so we needed webcams because we really wanted to capture this and put this on eBay.

51:32.340 --> 51:38.380
He would have been the next Star Wars kid, but we were unable to do that.

51:38.380 --> 51:42.260
I'm sure someone will post a link to Star Wars Kid if someone starts asking questions.

51:42.260 --> 51:44.300
Oh my God.

51:44.300 --> 51:49.220
Other than that, my week has been just busy with work stuff and everything and family

51:49.220 --> 51:52.580
stuff and home stuff and boring stuff.

51:52.580 --> 51:56.580
But I managed to make it here because I'm a day shifter next week.

51:56.580 --> 52:02.600
I work nights and so I work 11 p.m. to 8 a.m., if you can imagine that, the vampire shift.

52:02.600 --> 52:05.080
My older roommate used to work at vampire shifts, but it was at Wal-Mart.

52:05.080 --> 52:06.800
It wasn't a job nearly as cool as yours.

52:06.800 --> 52:07.800
It was enjoyable.

52:07.800 --> 52:11.440
I got to, you know, I like working nights and everything.

52:11.440 --> 52:12.440
It's nice.

52:12.440 --> 52:15.840
But I've got to be on day shift all this week because I've got to hire somebody and do all

52:15.840 --> 52:16.840
that fun stuff.

52:16.840 --> 52:17.840
I got you.

52:17.840 --> 52:18.840
Anyways, that's about it.

52:18.840 --> 52:19.840
Boring.

52:19.840 --> 52:21.840
No, it's good to have you here.

52:21.840 --> 52:22.840
Well, thank you.

52:22.840 --> 52:25.680
I'm glad that they switched you to day shift so we could get a chance to have you here,

52:25.680 --> 52:29.520
I am glad for our own selfish reasons we finally got you on the show.

52:29.520 --> 52:30.520
Thank you.

52:30.520 --> 52:31.520
I am glad to be here.

52:31.520 --> 52:37.520
As far as my week and my day, nothing too exciting.

52:37.520 --> 52:42.160
Thursday went out to golf land and I have been working on my doubles game.

52:42.160 --> 52:47.200
I noticed there was one high score list for one of the doubles that had no scores on it.

52:47.200 --> 52:49.080
I thought I would play just to get my name on it.

52:49.080 --> 52:51.340
That was kind of funny.

52:51.340 --> 52:52.680
My ego talking there.

52:52.680 --> 52:54.480
and um...

52:54.480 --> 52:59.960
What else did I do this week? Not really a whole heck of a lot, but I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy 11

52:59.960 --> 53:04.800
Shane, if you're out there, hello, he says, my buddy out in Kansas, we've been playing Final Fantasy 11

53:04.800 --> 53:06.520
like non-stop through the thing

53:06.520 --> 53:09.960
and the nice thing is we've been using this program TeamSpeak

53:09.960 --> 53:13.400
Vandalus, you're a big multiplayer game player, you probably know about this one, right?

53:13.400 --> 53:14.680
TeamSpeak, the one that allows you

53:14.680 --> 53:18.340
it basically turns your computer into Xbox Live, where you can use the microphone to talk to

53:18.340 --> 53:20.440
people and stuff like that, so it's cool

53:20.440 --> 53:23.720
it's been working out good for Final Fantasy XI.

53:23.720 --> 53:27.120
I know I haven't really gone into too much detail about Final Fantasy XI yet, that's

53:27.120 --> 53:31.160
because I still, even after two weeks of playing the game, I still feel like I have not scratched

53:31.160 --> 53:32.160
the surface.

53:32.160 --> 53:37.160
There's just so much more to discover in the game, and it's just so vast, there's so much

53:37.160 --> 53:38.320
to it.

53:38.320 --> 53:42.920
It's unlike any other Final Fantasy game, I still say it's kind of odd that they chose

53:42.920 --> 53:47.120
to go with Final Fantasy XI as opposed to Final Fantasy Online, but other than that,

53:47.120 --> 53:54.480
I mean, the game's terrific, it's just not what a lot of you are going to expect.

53:54.480 --> 53:56.520
So that was pretty much my week and my day.

53:56.520 --> 53:59.560
I didn't get to go see any cool movies or anything.

53:59.560 --> 54:02.700
Last night, I hung out with the out of town buddy who was here, played a lot of Karaoke

54:02.700 --> 54:09.440
Revolution and iToy, the new webcam tool for the PS2 is out, and we've been playing iToy

54:09.440 --> 54:10.440
a lot.

54:10.440 --> 54:13.840
And those of you that sit in our chat room during the week saw a random webcam was up

54:43.840 --> 54:50.840
You save it as a file, and then you upload it as an attachment to your email through broadband.

54:50.840 --> 54:52.840
You get what I'm saying?

54:52.840 --> 54:53.840
Wow.

54:53.840 --> 54:58.840
And then you would download it to your memory card using whatever software they have for the PS2.

54:58.840 --> 54:59.840
I don't really know.

54:59.840 --> 55:04.840
And then that way you can say, hey, fuck you, and then there will be an attachment.

55:04.840 --> 55:11.840
Can you imagine the social hacking you can do with that by convincing these kids,

55:11.840 --> 55:15.100
These kids say, hey, turn on your camera and click on this really cool link.

55:15.100 --> 55:18.600
And all of a sudden you can get all kinds of really fun voyeur stuff going on in the

55:18.600 --> 55:19.600
house.

55:19.600 --> 55:24.440
I'm being kind of sick.

55:24.440 --> 55:26.560
My friends actually told me about that, not me, sorry.

55:26.560 --> 55:32.720
Live triple X iToy, people having sex and stuff in rooms with the little bubbles and

55:32.720 --> 55:35.140
stuff floating around and you're popping them.

55:35.140 --> 55:39.440
Let's go out to the street and find a couple of whores and make the first iToy porn.

55:39.440 --> 55:40.440
No.

55:40.440 --> 55:43.640
Remember how they have the little rainbow feature and stuff?

55:43.640 --> 55:47.240
The guy does the cum shot and is all rainbow-y behind it.

55:47.240 --> 55:48.800
How about Itoy Fight Club?

55:48.800 --> 55:53.720
Now see, somebody's telling me that the longest you can do a video on Itoy is one minute.

55:53.720 --> 55:54.720
You know what?

55:54.720 --> 55:56.880
One minute's long enough for some guys.

55:56.880 --> 56:01.260
That's a money shot.

56:01.260 --> 56:08.600
We can not only invent a new form of internet porn, we can invent a whole new porn genre.

56:08.600 --> 56:13.880
one minute porn film in segments just like you know like 24 you know where

56:13.880 --> 56:18.080
it's like five second segments or whatever we really need Brad and he's

56:18.080 --> 56:23.400
not here to be able to provide some commentary to us that's all right he'll

56:23.400 --> 56:27.080
we can we can ask him later if we remember angels got a good comparison

56:27.080 --> 56:31.220
though she says I toy reminds her of when you remember the old game show Nick

56:31.220 --> 56:36.000
arcade that they would go inside the game and they'd have to do some kind of

56:36.000 --> 56:40.780
stupid thing inside the game. She says the iToy totally reminds her of that and I think

56:40.780 --> 56:45.100
she's right on the money. I think that's a damn good comparison. The iToy is like the

56:45.100 --> 56:47.300
last level of Nick Arcade. Wouldn't you say so, Loki?

56:47.300 --> 56:55.860
Well, if by making that comparison, if you're saying it looks like bumbling idiots playing

56:55.860 --> 57:04.140
the game, yes, that would be a perfect comparison. All right. Okay, so I think what we're going

57:04.140 --> 57:06.640
to do now is we're going to go ahead and take a break. We're going to do some more pop and

57:06.640 --> 57:11.420
music part 10 music and when we come back we're going to talk about karaoke revolutions

57:11.420 --> 57:14.700
all the rage this week. We're going to have to give our thoughts on that and the cage

57:14.700 --> 57:21.460
match too when we come back. In this break from the pop and 10 music soundtrack you're

57:21.460 --> 57:27.540
going to hear the new revenge song. Yes, Naoki's little pseudonym revenge has a new song on

57:57.540 --> 58:04.540
music 10 break. You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio. We'll be back.

58:27.540 --> 58:28.540
Hey!

58:28.540 --> 58:29.540
Hey!

58:29.540 --> 58:30.540
Hey!

58:30.540 --> 58:31.540
Hey!

58:31.540 --> 58:32.540
Hey!

01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:12.540
This is the end of the video, if you like it, please subscribe to my channel.

01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:44.540
Oh

01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:16.540
No shit, don't see me, bye, bye, bye

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:22.540
Where there's nothing on the way, oh you're there

01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:19.540
To be thoughts when they're dead

01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:23.540
Time has come now

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:26.540
We must go back there now

01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:32.540
To save the place where we end up and die

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:35.540
Out in the sky

01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:38.540
To the rest we can fly

01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:42.540
For the light

01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:45.540
Change is still a legend

01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:48.540
Keep your peace and send it

01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:51.540
Evil beckons to the night

01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:55.540
This is the end of all

01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:28.540
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because Real Radio makes Captain Jack cry.

01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:55.540
Hello, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:03:55.540 --> 01:04:00.540
Some more music in that break from the Pomp and Music 10 soundtrack.

01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:03.540
What did you guys think of some of those songs here?

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:06.540
Let's start off with the Revenge track.

01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:09.540
It was Ara Bhatia. What did you guys think of that one?

01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:15.540
This is interesting. It sounds just like a God of Death info with fucking Max Unlimited samples.

01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:18.540
Seriously, they need to get away from Max Unlimited.

01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:24.540
Let the max die, step away from the max.

01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:31.540
Yeah, good stuff. It's exotic ethnic, which is already good, so good stuff.

01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:34.540
Whatever, if they want to use samples from another song, it's fine with me.

01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:38.540
I mean, all these popular European and American DJs constantly use samples.

01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:42.540
Yeah, but they use good samples. That's such a bad sample.

01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:45.540
That sample right there makes me really pissed off at the song.

01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:51.980
Just like the ending of Matrix Revolutions, how they fucked up that song and made fun

01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:52.980
of the Hindus and stuff.

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:53.980
It makes me hate the movie.

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:54.980
God, some people.

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:55.980
You know...

01:04:55.980 --> 01:05:00.420
I haven't even seen the movie yet, so I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:02.380
What kind of irks me about the...

01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:03.380
It's a decent song.

01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:04.380
It's kind of fun.

01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:07.980
It's one of the better songs on the soundtrack, but I still picture Revenge as always doing

01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:12.300
these DDR songs and stuff, and there's no kind of backbeat to it, so I can't imagine

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:15.500
myself dancing to it, and for some reason that makes me not like it.

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:35.300
It's much more well-suited for 2DX than it is for BAG, but anyhow, that's fine.

01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:42.500
Revenge has always been Naoki trying to attempt to do ethnic sounding music, and that's fine

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:43.940
if it doesn't have a beat.

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:48.620
That's why it's in Papa Music and not DDR, whatever.

01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:53.420
The next song was from a group called Komo Tomak, and it's the genre of lonely, and it's

01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:54.420
Artemis.

01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:59.500
And there's actually a long version of this on the Papa Music 10 soundtrack.

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:01.060
Any thoughts on that?

01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:02.060
Where's Luna?

01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:04.060
And Sailor Moon and Sailor Mercury.

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:37.720
so funny. I want to see it. It's so cheesy. It's as he says, ill-conceived. It can't be

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:42.220
better than Strangers with Candy, though. Oh, well, no. It's not trying to be funny.

01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:46.100
No. It's funny because it's stupid. I thought you were telling me that the people that translated

01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:51.500
it or did the fan sub or whatever, that they tried to make it funny. They skipped. They

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:59.140
did some parody. They left in some commercials that are showing over in Japan, like a McDonald's

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:03.740
commercial with this Japanese Ronald McDonald and they they left in the

01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:07.460
commercials and they did a little parody fan sub to it like the McDonald's one

01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:11.420
shows the Ronald McDonald coming over and helping this little girl play with

01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:14.300
their friends because no one was like playing with her so she goes and plays

01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:17.980
with her and at the end it's got a little monologue by by Ronald McDonald

01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:20.860
and he says something Japanese I don't understand Japanese I don't know what he's

01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:25.300
saying but the subtitle says I'll always be watching you especially when you're

01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:32.240
And then there's this other one where it's like these girls in panties, little girls

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:36.200
wearing diapers, and it's a diaper commercial or something, and it says,

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:37.200
Pansufaito!

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:38.200
Pansufaito!

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:45.420
And at the end it goes, it goes, buy these panties guaranteed pre-worn by a petalicious

01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:47.920
girl just like this one.

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:48.920
It's so great!

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:54.440
Or the Sailor Moon memorabilia they sell, like these wands and stuff.

01:07:54.440 --> 01:08:01.320
Oh yeah, but they sell the memorabilia and it's like, what does he say, buy our Sailor

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:06.620
Moon toys so you can transform, just like Sailor Moon.

01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:13.800
And then at the end it goes, successful transformation, not guaranteed.

01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:17.920
Or the Hello Kitty one where it's like, hello kitty, hello kitty, or it's like, I don't

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:20.540
know, something Nick, hello kitty, hello kitty.

01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:25.820
the bottom it says evil kitty, evil kitty, evil kitty, and then it's like buy evil kitty

01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:32.700
mind control candy so we can control your kids and stuff like that. It's great.

01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:37.700
The last song we heard in that break was Sastro with Holy Forest.

01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:47.700
What did you think of that? Holy Forest, Batman.

01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:50.780
It's very J-Rock to me.

01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:55.100
I picture G.A.C.T. and ambiguous men singing high-pitched songs.

01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:59.780
It sounds to me like a melismizer thing, which is what G.A.C.T. is from.

01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:01.420
Good stuff.

01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:06.060
I'm not quite sure how it will play on pop music, but we'll see when it comes out here

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:09.060
or not here for home.

01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:13.220
Interesting point you brought up when we were listening to the soundtrack last night was

01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:23.400
I hear this with 2DX, but you said that you hear a lot of songs in pop music that really

01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:25.680
are better suited for guitar freaks.

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:29.800
Almost like they didn't make the cut for guitar freaks, but they really should have.

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:31.720
That song strikes me as one of those.

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:35.320
Or the good, cool, and Jeff Kootz song, Blaster.

01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:36.320
Which we'll hear later.

01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:39.320
We're going to hear some Taka and some Tack and Desro too.

01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:41.320
Oh, the Des-Q song.

01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:42.320
Yeah, the Des-Q.

01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:44.320
The Desro with DJ Taka.

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:45.320
I mean, not DJ Taka.

01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:46.320
Tack.

01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:52.320
And, um, yeah, like, these songs should really be on Guitar Cookies and Drummania if they're continuing to make these games.

01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:55.320
I mean, why put, whatever, I don't know.

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:57.320
Konami's kind of losing their mind.

01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:59.320
So, whatever.

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:01.320
Okay.

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:06.320
Alright, so that was the music in a Popin' 10 soundtrack, and we'll do some more later,

01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:12.440
but first, this is all the rage this week. Out now, just came out this week, a brand

01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:16.440
new Bomani game. Something brand new, and it's not in the arcades, it's only for the

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:22.600
home, and America, shock, got it first. Because the Japanese are getting a better version,

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:26.520
but that's alright, America got something first. We got some new Bomani, and yes, it

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:30.680
actually carries a Bomani logo, so this is an official new Bomani game, so we can talk

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:36.680
I'm sure you've heard about it by now.

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:39.680
Karaoke Revolution, out this week.

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:42.680
What are your guys' impressions of Karaoke Revolution?

01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:44.680
First, does somebody want to try and describe the game?

01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:46.680
Because I know not even all of us here have played it yet,

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:48.680
but does somebody want to try and describe the game?

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:49.680
Like how it plays?

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:50.680
Yeah, how it plays.

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:52.680
Because I think a lot of people still haven't gotten how it works yet.

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:53.680
You want to try and explain it, Brad?

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:55.680
First you go to the store and you shell out $70.

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:57.680
Okay, after that.

01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:06.680
Then you bring it home and you look at it, you ooble it, you rattle it, you get a microphone-headset combination like what Britney Spears and Madonna uses.

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:08.680
You put this thing on and you go into it.

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:17.680
You pick levels, you pick a song and you pick a level and it's got a crowd of people.

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:22.680
There's a band behind you, there's a character you pick who dances and they're over-developed in the head.

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:31.160
head, and they sing, and at the bottom is, like, you know, if anybody's ever seen karaoke,

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:34.720
words go by, or usually words are there, and then they light up as you're supposed to sing.

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:37.040
Yeah, the words, like, do this whole screen full of words.

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:41.680
Yeah, except with this, at the very bottom, there's, like, a rectangular section, takes

01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:46.200
up probably a third of the screen, or a quarter of the screen at the bottom, that has the

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:50.280
words that go from right to left. They scroll across the screen.

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:54.280
It's like watching the news on CNN and the words throw by on the bottom.

01:11:54.280 --> 01:12:00.760
And on the left is a line similar to any beat mania or DDR, it's a judgment line where you

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:03.320
have to start here.

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:07.840
And then from the top to the bottom where the words are, are lines of how long you're

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:08.900
supposed to hold a note.

01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:14.800
And they move up, they go up and down depending on if the note should be high or low or whatnot.

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:20.960
And some of the notes, and I'm not going to sing, but they'll go like, mmm, they'll rise.

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:23.520
You'll see the little line go up or down.

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:27.880
So you kind of have to follow the tone of it.

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:29.320
It just judges on the tone of it.

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:34.240
So you can pretty much make up any word you want or go la la la la, or like I did for

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:35.800
It's the End of the World.

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:42.800
Instead of doing the rap thing that he does, I go da da da da da, land on Burt Stein.

01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:44.280
The whole thing and I got it.

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:45.780
It's the only part of that rap I know is,

01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:47.780
Na-na-na, na-na-na, Leonard Bernstein.

01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:49.280
Exactly.

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:51.280
And it is so much fun.

01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:53.980
This is like the newest and best party game.

01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:54.680
They were right.

01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:56.700
I was kind of like, hmm, I don't know,

01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:59.160
when they were saying that it was going to be this big hit.

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:01.720
But as soon as we turned this on, I was like, oh my god,

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:04.120
this has so much possibility in America.

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:06.440
I never thought I would hear you sing,

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.360
but this game finally got it.

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:10.680
Well, I tried it, and I realized, like I thought

01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:11.680
before that I can't sing.

01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:12.920
So I just started to fuck around.

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:13.840
I started like saying.

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:14.840
Pretty good!

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:18.000
Fuck this game, this game fucking sucks, and it would still judge me right, so I was like

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000
cool!

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.320
Because it just grades on tone, and if it sounds like, because you can put lead vocals

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:26.040
on where they have a pre-recorded, it's not the original artist, but a lead, a person

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:31.600
singing along, if that's on and that person is singing really high, you can drop your

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:37.540
octave and it still grades, because it's got a pretty sophisticated tone recognition system

01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:38.540
in it.

01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:39.540
It's really good.

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:41.320
So, good stuff.

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:47.180
really funny to see because each song only has the lead vocals is only sung in

01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:50.940
the gender of the person who originally wrote the song or sang the song so like

01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:57.460
hmm let's see here the Madonna song what which one is it like a virgin like a

01:13:57.460 --> 01:14:02.980
virgin is sung in it by a girl and if you pick a male character they're up on

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:06.500
the screen singing and there's a female voice coming out of their mouth and

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:11.080
their lips are synced to the singing so it's really funny to watch like this

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:18.080
black guy get up there and go like, La, la, la, la, like a virgin, ooh, ooh, ooh, it's

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:19.080
good stuff.

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:21.680
I have to agree, this is a great game.

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:26.220
I was really skeptical about it at first, but it's fucking great.

01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:27.680
It's a great idea.

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:31.080
My only kind of, I have a couple of concerns with it though.

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:35.800
I mean, it's a great game, great party game, but as a solo game, it's not something I could

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:38.040
see myself kind of motivating myself to do solo.

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:44.520
So it will, whereas DDR will not make you a better dancer, Karaoke Revolution will make

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:45.520
you a better singer.

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:46.520
Maybe.

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:47.760
I don't know yet.

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:52.800
It'll help, it helps show you if you're on key or not, A. B, it helps you to kind of

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:55.120
hold your pitch and maintain your pitch.

01:14:55.120 --> 01:15:00.220
That's the biggest thing about it, is it really, really the way you get better at singing is

01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:01.800
by singing more and more.

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:04.800
So Karaoke Revolution will help you be a better singer.

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:09.920
It won't turn you into an all-star, but it will help you go from not so great, but to

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:10.920
decent.

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:13.680
Well, see, on the songs that it's got on there, it will point out to you that, hey, you're

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:16.920
not supposed to sing the song this certain way.

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:19.740
It actually shows you the way the song is supposed to be sung.

01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:23.540
For most parts, I noticed that in some of the songs, it looks like they programmed the

01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:28.320
lines in, the grading in, like maybe a little different than the original singer sang it.

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:31.680
I got kind of confused on some of the songs, I was like, wait a minute, the line is going

01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:36.520
up, or it stays straight when the singer is actually raising their pitch or lowering it

01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:39.520
and whatnot.

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:46.640
The biggest thing I don't like about it is that it's coded, the lines that go by that

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:51.140
you're supposed to sing are coded in only one way, so you can only sing the song in

01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:54.840
one way as far as your tone.

01:15:54.840 --> 01:16:00.520
You can't improvise, you can improvise words, unless you play non-judge mode.

01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:02.360
There is a free mode that you're not judged.

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:04.840
And you say you're not judged, so it's almost like not even really worth playing.

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:08.240
It's like, might as well just sing along to any song.

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:12.700
I wish that they had kind of like an edit mode where you can edit the lines in any way

01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:14.180
you wanted to.

01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:18.240
Like say you sang it without lines, and it would record those lines as you're singing

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:19.240
it.

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:20.240
Like an edit mode.

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.240
Like an edit mode for steps.

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:22.240
That's kind of weird, okay.

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:57.000
Like one person in the back, you'll hear somebody yell, you rock!

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000
It's really funny.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.440
You have to listen for the small things in Character Evolution.

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:05.920
I think it's advertisement for the Matrix, though, because most of the people in the

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:07.560
crowd are all agents.

01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:10.000
They all look exactly the same, wearing the same thing.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Yes.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:15.460
For the best, when you suck, they start walking away.

01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:19.000
And then if you totally fail the song, your person breaks down and cries on the stage.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000
They fall to the ground.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000
It's great.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.760
What do you think of the song list?

01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:28.480
I've heard some complaints, and this is kind of one of my chief complaints, it's kind of

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:34.760
not enough songs, but all things considered, they only licensed 35 songs or whatever.

01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:39.760
There are 35 pretty solid songs, they have a pretty damn good mix of music in it, I think.

01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:45.120
I think there's at least one, two songs that everybody's going to dig.

01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:49.760
Like when we fired it up and Broken Wings was in it, Loki was like, oh my God, cool.

01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:50.760
Yeah, exactly.

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:59.920
are some great classics in this. I mean, some of the best classic 80s music and some of

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:03.480
the better pop music, because I'm not a big fan of pop, you know, but some of the better

01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:06.840
pop music in here. I'm kind of a mild fan of Top 40 pop. There's

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:10.200
a lot of it I don't like, but there's a lot of it I do like, and I was really happy to

01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:13.680
see that there were a couple of Michelle Branch songs in there, because I dig her and stuff.

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:16.440
They have some good... Yeah, actually, I think they did a very good

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:21.440
job in the song selection except for, and I understand the reason why they did this,

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:25.760
I think, if it's the same reason I'm thinking, putting in songs like Son of a Preacher or

01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:26.760
whatever.

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:27.760
You know, whatever it's called.

01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:36.280
You are still mad that you got the Chain of Fools song on random last night.

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:38.600
You are still mad you had to sing that last night.

01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:41.720
Like they put some really stupid songs in, but that's just my opinion.

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:44.880
I know there are people out there that love these songs, these are classics.

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:46.880
I understand the purpose, it's just like, what?

01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:48.880
I don't want to sing to the pool.

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:51.880
There's going to be just as many songs that you hate as there are going to be that you

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:52.880
love.

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:54.880
There's less songs that I hate than there are songs that I like.

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:57.880
And like Bazaar and Love Triangle, it was like, oh my God.

01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:03.880
Yeah, some of the great 80s songs like Bazaar and Love Triangle, there was some other ones,

01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:04.880
but there's some good songs in there.

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:08.880
Pardon me for saying, but they've done a better job licensing music for Karaoke Revolution

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:09.880
than they have for DDR.

01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:11.880
For anything they've ever done.

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:16.780
revolution than they have for DDR for anything they've ever done this is it's

01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:21.080
good stuff and and I just hope that we get some good expansion discs here in

01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:26.560
America because yes there will be expansion discs because in the options

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:30.400
menu if you go to an options menu in the game there is an option to put in an

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:34.440
expansion disc if you hit the option that the machine will eject and it just

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:38.320
like a pen mode in DDR just like that I hope there's some really good stuff on

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:44.100
the expansion. If it's anything like what they released on the core mix that they just

01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:48.100
released, then we've got some good music coming out for the expansion.

01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:52.720
It really depends, I think, on how this game takes off. If it's really popular, if it goes

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:58.240
DDR style, then I think we'll see really specialized discs where it's going to be like women hits

01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:01.480
of the 90s type thing, expansion discs, then male hits of the 90s type thing.

01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:06.100
It's all dependent on how they advertise this thing, and Konami in America has not been

01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:14.300
been known for the best advertising campaigns, so it's, well, UltraMix, Microsoft is backing

01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:15.300
it, so it's everywhere.

01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:21.220
Yeah, UltraMix has just the Xbox thing, because I think Xbox kind of knows, like Xbox is still

01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:25.620
kind of struggling a little bit, and I think they know if they can take the DDR market

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:30.540
a little bit, then they're going to have some more machines being sold.

01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:31.540
Unfortunately.

01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:35.120
I never, never considered buying an Xbox until UltraMix was announced, and now that I've

01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:38.520
I've seen the video which is out on the official site, maybe we'll have to have this later,

01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:43.360
but there's a video out on the official site and it's, wow, I'm very impressed that they've

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:48.240
kind of just done what they've needed to do for DDR for a long time.

01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:49.240
Give it a facelift.

01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:50.240
Yeah.

01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:55.080
Something I'm kind of interested in, and I know there's a few other dorky, otaku type

01:20:55.080 --> 01:21:00.020
people out there who agree with me, people who listen to J-rock and other Japanese J-pop

01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:04.480
and Japanese music, because I solely listen to Japanese stuff because I think America's

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:08.600
making bullshit music right now. There's nothing good out there right now. So I'm listening

01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:16.280
to other countries' music and stuff. I hope that the Japanese versions are worthy of bringing

01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:21.240
over, well not bringing over here, but for me to import, because there's a lot of J-Rock

01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:25.300
and J-Pop songs that I really, really like that I would love to get to play in Karaoke

01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:29.120
Revolution, you know? I hope some Lark and Seal stuff shows up, or you know.

01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:34.120
I was going to say, in Japan, they are doing karaoke revolution in Japan too, and if you

01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:41.180
go to the official karaoke revolution website for Japan, six expansion discs are coming

01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:42.180
out this month.

01:21:42.180 --> 01:21:43.180
I think later this month.

01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:46.520
Six discs, and we're talking, and they kind of do the genre thing a little bit because

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:50.920
there's one that's specifically for ballads, and then there's a couple J-pop hits, and

01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:51.920
things like that.

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:56.240
And there are groups, Morning Musume, Ayumi, of course, Ayumi's on there of course.

01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:58.900
What were some of the other bands?

01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:00.260
You remember any of them, Loki?

01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:01.260
I don't know, but...

01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:02.420
I just remember Morning Musume.

01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:05.580
I can't wait to sing, uh, Chokoto Love, what Petit Love was based off of.

01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:07.460
I don't think Chokoto Love was on there.

01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:08.460
Really?

01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:09.460
No, I don't.

01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:10.460
I would have recognized it.

01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:11.460
I think.

01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:12.460
I may have missed it.

01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:13.460
I may have missed it.

01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:14.460
Or the original Freckles Suboxis.

01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:15.460
Uh, however you pronounce it.

01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:16.460
Yeah.

01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:17.460
All right.

01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:18.460
That would be great.

01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:19.460
Terry, uh, comment?

01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:20.460
Oh, actually.

01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:22.060
My parents have something that's kind of like this.

01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:27.060
It's a, um, this stand-alone DVD karaoke-based thing that does the same kind of thing.

01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:30.940
It measures the tone and the timing that you do.

01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:38.660
It's got nine DVDs of Korean, Japanese, Filipino, Chinese, and American music.

01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:39.660
The DVDs are swappable.

01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:42.140
The thing is, it's about $400.

01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:46.740
It's totally awesome because every time we go down there, we spend the first day just

01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:47.740
doing this thing.

01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:48.740
I'm doing gangsters.

01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:56.300
It's great because the backgrounds have absolutely nothing to do with the show.

01:22:56.300 --> 01:23:01.360
They had Gangsta's Paradise, and the background is showing this peaceful little farm, almost

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:05.680
like it should be Amish Paradise, and it was, it's just great.

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:08.120
That reminds me of when we went to, was it Cyberzone?

01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:09.120
Yeah.

01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:10.120
And they had the karaoke booth.

01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:11.120
Oh my god, the karaoke game?

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:12.120
The karaoke booth?

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:15.620
And they had all these songs you get to play, and it does grade you, but we couldn't figure

01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:17.620
out how it grades you, because at the end it would give you like a really high grade.

01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:22.340
It just gave you a score, and we didn't, no, because I remember Irene and I found Smile

01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:26.180
D.K., Butterfly, and Boyz. We found Smile D.K. in the book, and we're like,

01:23:26.180 --> 01:23:29.220
hee hee, we're going to sing the DDR song. And we sang Boyz, and we got 100.

01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:32.580
And we got the big fanfare and everything. That's the thing is, I noticed you guys suck,

01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:35.260
and you still got high credit. Shut up!

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:38.420
Anyway, well, I mean, I read some of that. Oh my, you don't even want to know how much

01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:40.620
time I spent in that stupid karaoke room at the tournament.

01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:44.300
I was there, man. You were in there all the time with her. I was like, man, get out of

01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:46.300
there. It was so much fun. We had a blast. We were

01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:49.900
laughing our ass off in there. Like, the great thing is, just like Terry

01:23:49.900 --> 01:24:08.900
This video has nothing to do with anything, it's to throw you off, totally.

01:24:08.900 --> 01:24:13.940
Yeah, that's the thing though is that this game if you've any if you've played I don't know about the one that Terry is talking about

01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:18.300
But I would assume it's kind of like the one that we saw in cyberzone where it grades you

01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:22.520
But this thing is like a really really accurate grading system this karaoke revolution

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:28.580
I was so surprised at how much work they put into it. Why don't they put some more work into DVR like they did this?

01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:33.700
Some some other comments from chow and address some comments that came up in the chat room one comment

01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:36.220
Why don't you buy karaoke revolution for the Japanese ps2?

01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:41.420
So not likely to happen unless they release some kind of American songs expansion pack

01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:47.460
because I can't sing in Japanese and I'm not going to just fake it, I mean I don't know

01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:48.460
any of the songs.

01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:54.180
I don't listen to Jay music as much as Brad does, maybe he would like it, but I just wouldn't

01:24:54.180 --> 01:24:56.580
know the songs well enough to necessitate buying it.

01:24:56.580 --> 01:25:00.100
I think this is one of those rare cases where the American version has something for me

01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:01.700
and the Japanese doesn't.

01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:07.660
It's just for those people like me, I don't understand Japanese, but from listening to

01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:17.800
a lot of Japanese music, like Aimee Miyazaki, Lark and Seal, tons of Japanese pop and rock

01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:22.100
artists and stuff, I can pick up a lot of these words and I start to know the lyrics.

01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:26.220
I'll look at the lyrics and I can sing the lyrics in Japanese.

01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:29.060
I have no fucking idea what they're talking about, they could be saying, you stupid hunky

01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:35.860
bitches from America stop buying our shit, or doing this stuff. But for me, or for anybody

01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:40.460
like me who's that into it, yeah, you could go ahead and import the Japanese versions.

01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:44.860
I might, depending on how good the Japanese versions are, what kind of songs are on them.

01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:50.540
But somebody like Rob, I don't think he really cares to fake singing in Japanese.

01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:54.640
I think my time's just better spent making myself better singing American songs, because

01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:57.280
I go to actual karaoke bars and sing sometimes.

01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:04.560
You're not going to go to a karaoke bar and start singing something in Japanese.

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:05.560
People would be like...

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:09.220
I have seen, because they do let you bring in your own music, and I saw somebody once

01:26:09.220 --> 01:26:18.180
they brought in, it was an Indian song, it sounded like it was straight out of a Bollywood

01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:22.020
picture type thing, and he was doing the dance and everything, it was great.

01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:23.460
I mean, I was entertained by it.

01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:25.740
I didn't know what the hell he was saying, but it was totally entertaining.

01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:28.140
Yeah, well you get your freaks in there every once in a while.

01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:29.980
Well, you know, I wouldn't say he was a freak.

01:26:29.980 --> 01:26:30.980
He was...

01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:31.980
He brought up forces.

01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:32.980
He brought up forces.

01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:33.980
He brought up forces.

01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:34.980
Confusing language.

01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:35.980
You're an ass.

01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:36.980
You're an ass.

01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:37.980
Confusing language.

01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:38.980
Seriously.

01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:49.420
Okay, what were some other things I wanted to address in the room?

01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:57.040
Oh, yes, Mel B, a favorite guest of Orange Lawns Radio, has a cameo in KOG Revolution

01:26:57.040 --> 01:26:59.520
and it's actually in a video that you unlock.

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:04.720
We haven't gotten it ourselves yet, but apparently you can unlock the song one week when you

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:10.640
beat Solo Mode and you get a video with it, too, in the video section, and apparently

01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:13.200
Mel B is in there singing a little bit of one week.

01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:17.380
It's a clip of all these people singing one week and apparently he's in it, so of course

01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:18.880
you know we're going to unlock that shit this week.

01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:22.840
do it now and we will play it on the show for you next week and maybe we can get Loki

01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:26.800
to remix it. Sorry guys we're cutting off the show now

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:31.620
we have to go unlock Mel B's video. I want to wait until the next time he's actually

01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:34.320
here on the show which might not be hopefully in the next couple weeks.

01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:38.340
Tell him to unlock it now. I'm going to unlock it now so I can see it

01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:44.060
but I want to get him here and then play it over and over and say hey Mel and play the

01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:47.860
sound and then, you know, embarrass the shit out of them.

01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:51.620
I don't know. I don't know what it is yet. We will see soon. But I hear it's really cute

01:27:51.620 --> 01:27:55.820
that they even have like a, they have a dog wearing the headset at one point, and it barks.

01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:59.520
Aww, cute. Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf. Which is, you know, what the original song kind

01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:07.380
of sounds like to me. Any other thoughts on Karaoke Revolution?

01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:12.220
Thank God they don't have that stupid song All Star in there. That's all I gotta say.

01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:14.680
hey now you're an all-star that one

01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:17.260
yeah why such a hatred on that specific song

01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:21.880
cuz they use it like every single fucking movie trailer and shit for like

01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:26.440
all these lame ass movies you know you have mystery man and shrek

01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:30.580
i like the movie too but the trailer was lame garbage

01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:35.260
okay and shrek 2 which i just saw before elf

01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:37.060
also had that

01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:38.380
yeah shrek 2

01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:41.500
also had the god damn song on it too

01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:45.500
It's just like, ugh!

01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:46.500
Hey Loki, Shrek 2?

01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:49.500
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your-

01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:51.500
I'm gonna punch you.

01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:53.500
I don't like that song either, I don't-

01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:54.500
I hate it too.

01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:56.500
Is that Smash Mouth?

01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:58.500
Fuck Smash Mouth.

01:28:58.500 --> 01:28:59.500
No thanks.

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:02.500
They're doing all these commercials now because they can't make any more music.

01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:05.500
They're constantly doing educational commercials and shit.

01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:06.500
It's so stupid.

01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:10.500
any more thoughts on karaoke revolution Brad?

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:14.500
being one of the only other ones that's played it, the other ones I can tell were boring

01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:18.500
everyone else here they're like yeah haven't played it, go out and buy it

01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:22.500
please everybody, cause we want Konami to get more money off of this

01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:26.500
so that they can go ahead and make more stuff like this in America

01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:30.500
then again maybe if we tell them to not buy it and it does bad, maybe they'll put more of their

01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:34.500
time and money into games like Castlevania instead of... and DDR

01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:38.500
No, I could give a fuck about DVR as long as I'm getting my Castlevania on.

01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:10.500
pretty darn good song. It's a group called CyberX and it features somebody named Rupina

01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:14.420
and it's called Little Flower. The way the cage match works is that we're going to play

01:30:14.420 --> 01:30:18.000
three songs for you guys and you vote for your favorite and that song goes into rotation

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:22.620
all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bimani Music and More program. But you have to be

01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:28.120
in our chat room to play along so head over to www.calibimani.com, click on Orange Lounge

01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:32.460
and click on chat. Whole shitload of people in our chat room tonight. It's more crowded

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:39.460
the first song you can vote for tonight.

01:31:02.460 --> 01:31:13.460
I can't believe this is the last time I've ever felt like this

01:31:13.460 --> 01:31:20.460
I can't believe this is the last time I've ever felt like this

01:31:20.460 --> 01:31:26.480
fights with every was about the cheese

01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:28.360
I know you haven't

01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:22.860
called

01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:34.380
Oh

01:31:39.740 --> 01:31:41.740
Oh

01:33:41.740 --> 01:34:09.580
Alright, that was about half of last week's winner, CyberX featuring Rupino with Little

01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:42.580
It was huge. A lot of you liked it. It was Sandstorm.

01:34:42.580 --> 01:34:46.580
And Darude has a new song out now that is my pick for tonight's cave match. It's called Music.

01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:49.580
And it's not like, hey Mr. DJ kind of music, but it's, you know.

01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:53.580
Or, I got a music, don't stop.

01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:56.580
I don't think there's, there isn't, Darude's not in UltraMix.

01:34:56.580 --> 01:34:59.580
No.

01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:05.580
Well, whatever. I don't care if it's going to be in DDR in the future.

01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:12.580
I think it would be good for DDR, though, but anyway, here's my pick for tonight's cage match. It's Darude with music. Enjoy.

01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:40.580
to

01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:45.580
the

01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:50.580
the

01:35:50.580 --> 01:35:55.580
the

01:35:55.580 --> 01:36:00.580
the

01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:58.580
Don't you think, B.J., live it, record to the fact, don't you think, live it, don't you think,

01:37:58.580 --> 01:38:00.580
Oh

01:38:28.580 --> 01:38:35.580
Let's go around and see what folks thought of that, we'll start with Brad.

01:38:58.580 --> 01:39:06.580
Pretty good. I don't think I'm a huge fan of Darude, because they're kind of a cookie-cutter trance for me.

01:39:06.580 --> 01:39:12.580
But it's still good. I would have to vote for that if I could only vote for the last song or this song.

01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:15.580
Alright. And scale 1 to 10?

01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:18.580
Scale 1 to 10? I'll give it a 7.

01:39:18.580 --> 01:39:21.580
Alright. Will!

01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:26.580
pvtsteve didn't you send this to me a long time ago?

01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:41.580
pvtsteve it's not bad though

01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:16.580
kostjamrh I remember when we used to do the secret word of the day and stuff, when we used to be falling down laughing because we'd be making fun of ravers.

01:40:25.580 --> 01:40:30.580
kostjamrh I remember when OrangeZion's radio was funny.

01:40:31.580 --> 01:40:36.580
kostjamrh I gave it a 6

01:40:36.580 --> 01:40:43.580
I thought it was very trance-y and very repetitive, like trance-y songs can be.

01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:45.580
And I'd give that one a 7.

01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:47.580
I definitely liked it better than the first one.

01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:51.580
Bradley, your thoughts on Darude music?

01:40:51.580 --> 01:40:55.580
Pretty much the same as everyone else is kind of saying.

01:40:55.580 --> 01:41:00.580
Sort of there and repetitive, but not too bad, so a 7.

01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:02.580
All right.

01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:09.580
I give it an 8, because no song named Music is allowed to be a 10 unless it's Madonna.

01:41:14.580 --> 01:41:19.580
Now if it was Madonna remixed by Oak and Fold, because I know they have one of Music.

01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:22.580
Oak and Fold does some great Madonna mixes.

01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:25.580
Oak and Fold can take anything and make it good.

01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:32.000
God dammit, I almost picked the Oak and Fold song for tonight's

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:39.000
I would come!

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Kill Bill, Battle Without Honor or Humanity, The 88 Severed Limbs Mix

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.500
The light and knowledge that we need to be the best of a black man

01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:36.500
This wizard was a fan of the waves of a dark land

01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:38.500
The terror that had us through it, everything we proved

01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:40.500
It's Friday the first day, you go a-fucking-through

01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:42.500
It's dangerous if I don't mind, it's pretty dark and fine

01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:44.500
It's same with the sirens, dance with the gooey swine

01:44:44.500 --> 01:44:45.500
This thing that's only once vain

01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:47.500
This body, I'm at the hop, bummer and sing a song

01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:49.500
I wanna run the father, maybe it'll be wrong

01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:26.500
2. Battle Without Honor or Humanity 88-Severed Limbs Mix

01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:54.500
That was awesome. That's all I have to say. That is getting 5,000 out of 10.

01:45:57.500 --> 01:45:59.500
So there you go. I'm stroking his ego.

01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:02.500
Looks like you're stroking your dick there, too. That's what made you so happy.

01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:07.500
Well, I got some sticky stuff on my fingers from licking something.

01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:10.500
Will, your thoughts?

01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:35.500
kostjamrh Yeah, that song pretty much owned the rest of the song, so I'd give that one.

01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:42.500
kostjamrh I give it a 1 and then a 0 for a 10.

01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:10.500
dukeofthebump

01:47:35.500 --> 01:47:39.500
dukeofthebump

01:48:05.500 --> 01:48:12.500
Alright, let's review. But you know what? As much as we might like that song, it's really up to you guys in the chat room. You guys have the votes.

01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:15.500
So here it is. We're going to recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.

01:48:15.500 --> 01:48:21.500
You send your votes over private message to Sky in the chat room. Hello, I'm there in the chat room waiting for your vote.

01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:27.500
Song number one you can vote for tonight. Last week's winner, two weeks in a row now, CyberX featuring Groupino with Little Flower.

01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:51.300
All right, song number two that you can vote for tonight is Darude with Music.

01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:54.820
All right, and song number three that you can vote for tonight is Battle Without a Honor

01:48:54.820 --> 01:48:57.060
or Humanity, the 88 Severed Limbs mix.

01:48:57.060 --> 01:48:58.060
This is the newest remix from Loki.

01:48:58.060 --> 01:49:13.060
All right, there they are.

01:49:13.060 --> 01:49:14.060
Send your votes now.

01:49:14.060 --> 01:49:17.020
Place vote now.

01:49:17.020 --> 01:49:20.260
Send those over private message to Sky.

01:49:20.260 --> 01:49:25.740
I'm looking at the directory of Loki remixes and it looks like he's got about 12 of them

01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:33.460
now. Almost enough for a CD. Almost. Something. That's alright. I think, actually, why don't

01:49:33.460 --> 01:49:36.380
we play that other Loki mix? Do you want to talk about your other remix that you did this

01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:41.420
week, Loki, that you wanted to debut tonight? I did this one this morning, because, actually,

01:49:41.420 --> 01:49:46.460
it was something that Angel's working on right now, and so I give her credit for the name,

01:49:46.460 --> 01:49:52.100
and DarkTuxedo also came up with the name, and IDA last night, but I just threw one together

01:49:52.100 --> 01:49:55.340
to see how it would end up, because they were working on it.

01:49:55.340 --> 01:49:59.020
And so I was like, OK, well, I'll work on my version of it.

01:49:59.020 --> 01:50:01.260
It's QQQ and Quasar.

01:50:01.260 --> 01:50:03.500
They don't really go together, but I just

01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:06.940
figured for the hell of it just to try it and see if it worked.

01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:09.700
And what else is QQQ?

01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:11.940
This is QQQ Quasar, I guess.

01:50:11.940 --> 01:50:12.740
Whatever.

01:50:12.740 --> 01:50:14.500
QQQ Quasar.

01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:17.380
All right, so this is kind of an idea you ruthlessly stole

01:50:17.380 --> 01:50:19.260
from Angel, basically.

01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:21.540
Well, actually, just from the chat room in general.

01:50:21.540 --> 01:50:27.540
I just did it for the holidays, just to see, you know, what it was. I don't know, whatever.

01:50:27.540 --> 01:50:31.540
Alright, let's check this out. This is the other new Loki remix we have today to be with you tonight.

01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:38.540
tonight it's Loki vs. Tack with QQ Quasar.

01:52:01.540 --> 01:52:20.020
Alright, that's the other Loki song we want to debut tonight, Loki vs. Tack with QQ Quasar,

01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:23.980
an idea that was ruthlessly stolen from our chat room, but you did a nice job with it.

01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:24.980
Very nice job.

01:52:24.980 --> 01:52:29.100
It's just as some folks are saying, well, Brad, tell listeners what you've been saying

01:52:29.100 --> 01:52:30.100
while that song's playing.

01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:59.100
QQQ would have a lot more potential with this other song, I can't think off the bat what it would mix better with, but still a good effort, I like it.

01:52:59.100 --> 01:53:05.100
No, not electrical parade music, I don't know, maybe you could make it sound good, but we'll see.

01:53:29.100 --> 01:53:34.820
electrical parade. It was something like that though. I don't remember exactly what it is,

01:53:34.820 --> 01:53:47.100
but that song would go good with this because it sounds the same. Okay. I'm going to give

01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:55.900
a couple more minutes for the cage match votes to come in. In the meantime, gosh, I'm stretched

01:53:55.900 --> 01:54:00.520
for topics to talk about tonight what what's on your what's on your guys's

01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:06.600
mind anything guy related well I've been working on my little thing I didn't get

01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:12.160
to meet with Keith this week so that made me mad but I've been working on my

01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:19.640
list for this thing that I'm doing and it sucks because I was going on DDR

01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:23.040
maniacs because they're doing they have a threat about remaking banners so

01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:27.820
work perfectly for what I'm doing. The thing is is a certain some way that we

01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:31.100
used to know that used to be in our chat room but got banned from our chat room

01:54:31.100 --> 01:54:35.180
went ahead and went and fucked up the DDR maniacs forums so if you take a look

01:54:35.180 --> 01:54:39.360
at DDR maniacs forums you'll see that a certain somebody that goes by the

01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:45.540
name Newt decided to take it take a poop on the forums there and fuck them all up

01:55:15.540 --> 01:55:44.700
The next game that will be coming out for itoy is a full on dance game that will have

01:56:14.700 --> 01:56:18.820
It's more of a party game like it would be the best thing ever drunk like I could see myself

01:56:19.100 --> 01:56:24.500
Drunk and playing that sparkles mode where all your motion creates little rainbow sparkles on the screen

01:56:24.500 --> 01:56:26.500
I can see that entertaining myself for hours

01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:29.880
That's so a stoner game too. You know with the bubbles

01:56:30.620 --> 01:56:32.620
Oh

01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:35.420
Sweet

01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:38.780
It's just like so

01:56:38.820 --> 01:56:40.900
It's just a stoner game

01:56:40.900 --> 01:56:47.440
It's like a game for everyone that you can play this game and no matter what, you know, just find something that you'll enjoy in it

01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:52.180
I mean, they've got some pretty fun stuff and they have a mode in there. It's a game. That's just like that

01:56:52.580 --> 01:56:54.580
FantaVision where it's with

01:56:56.300 --> 01:57:00.960
Fireworks the music and that's really good. No, it's kind of neat. I like FantaVision. That's a pretty cool game

01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:06.140
They actually made a sequel to that too weird is kind of neat and then they have another game. That's like a kung-fu thing

01:57:06.140 --> 01:57:10.740
That's kind of fun kung-fu. That one's awesome. Yeah. Yeah. I love when you have to break the um

01:57:10.740 --> 01:57:16.160
you have to break the boards. It's just so funny because on the screen you can see yourself

01:57:16.160 --> 01:57:22.620
mirrored in doing what you're doing. Everybody, when they break the boards, they're using

01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:25.800
their hands like this. You can't really see it, but they're pointing it straight out like

01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:30.060
they're doing a paper and rock, paper, scissors. And they poke it with their fingers. Poke

01:57:30.060 --> 01:57:35.500
the board, and it breaks. And they'll hit it with their elbow. It's good stuff.

01:57:35.500 --> 01:57:40.660
The one that was hilarious to me was the Ice Queen was over and he hates spiders more than

01:57:40.660 --> 01:57:46.400
anything and there's a spider thing on there and it's great because what the spiders do

01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:51.260
is it puts a bunch of spiders on the screen that are attracted to motion so if you move

01:57:51.260 --> 01:57:53.860
a little bit, the spiders will jump on you really quickly.

01:57:53.860 --> 01:57:54.860
It's so funny.

01:57:54.860 --> 01:57:57.940
They attach their sides to your head and they don't get off.

01:57:57.940 --> 01:58:01.100
It made the Ice Queen run out of the room screaming like the faggie is.

01:58:01.100 --> 01:58:02.100
It was great.

01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:03.100
I loved it.

01:58:03.100 --> 01:58:04.420
Then they have the bees.

01:58:04.420 --> 01:58:05.420
You can play with bees.

01:58:05.420 --> 01:58:06.420
Oh really?

01:58:06.420 --> 01:58:07.420
I didn't see that.

01:58:07.420 --> 01:58:10.100
That's what kids need to learn to play with bees.

01:58:10.100 --> 01:58:11.100
Yeah.

01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:12.100
I did.

01:58:12.100 --> 01:58:13.100
And I paid for it when I was a kid.

01:58:13.100 --> 01:58:17.380
What other ones did they have on there that were pretty funny?

01:58:17.380 --> 01:58:20.140
Garrah's playing with a, they had like a mirror thing.

01:58:20.140 --> 01:58:21.140
It was like a carnival mirror.

01:58:21.140 --> 01:58:22.140
I played with that thing.

01:58:22.140 --> 01:58:23.140
Yeah.

01:58:23.140 --> 01:58:24.140
That was funny.

01:58:24.140 --> 01:58:25.140
The mirror.

01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:26.140
Oh yeah.

01:58:26.140 --> 01:58:27.140
The mirror was great.

01:58:27.140 --> 01:58:28.140
So, iToy, good thing, bad thing?

01:58:28.140 --> 01:58:29.140
What the hell is this thing?

01:58:29.140 --> 01:58:30.940
Is it going to go the way of the Super Scope and all these other peripherals that only

01:58:30.940 --> 01:58:33.100
ever had one game out and just died?

01:58:33.100 --> 01:58:40.980
There's no way to know where it's going to go, but I think if we get some imaginative

01:58:40.980 --> 01:58:46.100
game developers to use this peripheral for something else, I think there's some huge

01:58:46.100 --> 01:58:47.940
possibilities for this thing.

01:58:47.940 --> 01:58:53.300
If anything, you're going to see it used for a bunch of different applications, not necessarily

01:58:53.300 --> 01:58:55.900
as a full game, but like add-on things.

01:58:55.900 --> 01:59:00.580
For instance, I'm sure they're going to do this, you'll be playing a first person shooter

01:59:00.580 --> 01:59:04.140
and you can take a screencap of your face and post it on your character's face.

01:59:04.140 --> 01:59:07.940
Yeah, that's what I was thinking, mapping the face, your face onto the character's face

01:59:07.940 --> 01:59:11.260
so it gets even more personalized. You can go and kill your friends.

01:59:11.260 --> 01:59:16.260
Yeah, and you could do Para Para with this thing, the more that I think about it. The

01:59:16.260 --> 01:59:21.660
dance game that comes with it is very Para Para-ish. It has sensors in the same space,

01:59:21.660 --> 01:59:26.060
but instead of sensors coming from the ground, it's just measuring where your hands are on

01:59:26.060 --> 01:59:27.900
the cam. You could do Para Para with this thing.

01:59:27.900 --> 01:59:31.160
It's like Parapar, where the five sensors, instead of being in front of you, they're

01:59:31.160 --> 01:59:39.840
above you, like a corona all around you, but it plays, to me, more like Space Channel 5.

01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:41.640
You have, she'll do something, and then you have to...

01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:43.640
It plays like Parappa to me, more, well, okay, Space Channel 5.

01:59:43.640 --> 01:59:44.640
No, I can see Space Channel 5.

01:59:44.640 --> 01:59:45.800
It's exactly like Space Channel 5.

01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:47.040
I can see Space Channel 5.

01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:50.160
I was thinking more Parappa, but, yeah, Space Channel 5's probably a better description

01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:51.160
for it.

01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:54.280
And then there's a beat mania, quote unquote, came in there, too, which is the same thing,

01:59:54.280 --> 01:59:57.520
except it's four speakers in the corner, and it has a licensed song in it.

01:59:57.520 --> 02:00:02.520
Singing it back, swing it back, sing it back to me

02:00:02.520 --> 02:00:06.520
That game reminds me kind of a little more like Slamade Amigo

02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:09.520
Because the things come from the center like Slamade Amigo

02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:11.520
And then go to the outside

02:00:11.520 --> 02:00:12.520
So yeah, good stuff

02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:15.520
I think my favorite game in the whole thing though was the Fantavision one

02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:16.520
The fireworks one

02:00:16.520 --> 02:00:18.520
Yeah that was cool because the little detonating things on the side

02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:19.520
That one's really fun

02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:21.520
Touching the fireworks and then BOOM

02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:24.520
And the music's great, it's hella like ravery, hard and snowy

02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:25.520
It's really good

02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:32.160
I love taking the pictures of yourself with little profiles.

02:00:32.160 --> 02:00:37.800
I think if Xbox should do one of these for Xbox Live, they would have a ball with this.

02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:42.000
And the greatest thing ever is when they do a picture for the high score.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:47.080
When you score, you know, top score or whatever, you take a photo and their photo gets stuck

02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:48.080
with the high score.

02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:49.080
That's the greatest.

02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:50.080
It's funny.

02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:52.520
I love how for the profile you get the pictures.

02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:55.880
There are three pictures that will tell you the picture of like a, it says do a happy

02:00:55.880 --> 02:00:59.660
face, then a sad face, then a silly face, and so when you go to the profiles to select

02:00:59.660 --> 02:01:03.160
your character you want to play as, like Matt will have his own and Rob will have his own,

02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:09.360
it shows their faces changing from like happy, silly, or then they have some really pointless

02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:14.080
modes but they're kind of fun even still, like the window washing, oh the window washing,

02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:19.720
the weird song in the background, it's like this old 40, when I'm washing windows, it's

02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:23.800
It's like this really hella old 40s or 30s song.

02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:25.800
It's just perfect though, it fits.

02:01:25.800 --> 02:01:27.000
Good stuff.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Yeah.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:29.000
Good times.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Very.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:36.240
But actually, I remember a long time ago, we were reading up on, they were developing

02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:42.240
a dance dance revolution type thing with motion capturing just like this and I remember looking

02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:43.240
and going, that's stupid.

02:01:43.240 --> 02:01:47.720
And you know what, if I think when I see this new dancing game, I think I'll think the exact

02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:56.360
the same thing. It'll be stupid. It's a good concept, but it's not for people doing it

02:01:56.360 --> 02:02:01.640
for accuracy, like all the PAers out there. It's not going to work.

02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:07.160
Yeah, it's not super accurate. I was getting kind of frustrated because I felt like I was

02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:13.640
hitting it on time, like rhythm and stuff. There's a game in there where it's a mirror

02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:16.960
game where you have to hit these, you have to hit the green ones and not the red ones

02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:20.480
where you get penalized, they're like these little bubbles, and what happens is it creates

02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:25.800
like a mirror effect where one half of the screen changes upside down and what not, so

02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:31.080
you would expect when you raise your hand to touch it, like it goes in a completely

02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:34.140
opposite, it's hard to explain, you'd have to see it, but the thing is that since you're

02:02:34.140 --> 02:02:40.240
raising your arm, any part of your arm can touch the sensor area on the screen and you

02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:44.240
you fuck yourself up, so it's just not a very accurate type of sentence.

02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:49.240
Or, depending on the lighting in your room, a shadow could set it off.

02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:56.240
Yeah, exactly. It's not the most accurate style of whatnot, you know what I mean?

02:02:56.240 --> 02:03:01.240
What the hell? Oh, there. Okay, anyway.

02:03:01.240 --> 02:03:06.240
Okay, I think it's time to announce the winner of the Orange Launch Cage Match. What do you guys think?

02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:09.240
Here is tonight's winner, the Orange Lounge Cage Match.

02:03:09.240 --> 02:03:12.240
I think this one isn't too difficult to figure out.

02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:15.240
It wasn't unanimous. I thought it would be, but it was not.

02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:18.240
But it was a pretty big landslide nonetheless.

02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:20.240
This is tonight's Cage Match winner.

02:03:22.240 --> 02:03:26.240
Battle Without Honor, Humanity, The 88's, Evers, Limbs, Mix, of course.

02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:31.240
Wins tonight's Orange Lounge Cage Match.

02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:33.240
You guys cool with that?

02:04:03.240 --> 02:04:10.680
The DDR Megamix that we're going to hear, the artist is credited with DDR and it's all

02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:13.920
these DDR songs mixed together, so we'll hear that.

02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:18.040
Good Cool featuring Jeff Koot with Blaster, I promise that one.

02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:20.480
So we're going to hear Blaster this break.

02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:26.140
And you know what, hey Brad, I need your help here.

02:04:26.140 --> 02:04:32.100
Is Iconoclasm, is that the Taka featuring DJW one?

02:04:32.100 --> 02:04:35.400
They totally changed their name, I'm not sure if it's that or not.

02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:36.400
The anthem trance?

02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:37.400
Taka and DJW.

02:04:37.400 --> 02:04:38.400
Taka and DJW.

02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:40.140
Okay, we're going to hear that one too.

02:04:40.140 --> 02:04:44.980
The Taka and DJW in the genre of anthem trance, it's Vatam Stelaru.

02:04:44.980 --> 02:04:47.900
And they call themselves iconoclasm, which is why I was thrown off because I couldn't

02:04:47.900 --> 02:04:49.740
remember what they had called themselves.

02:04:49.740 --> 02:04:51.100
So we're going to hear all that this break.

02:04:51.100 --> 02:04:55.300
The DDR Megamix, Good Cool and Jeff Koot, and Taka and W.

02:04:55.300 --> 02:04:57.660
When we come back, the FUs of the week.

02:04:57.660 --> 02:05:04.660
We'll be back.

02:06:27.660 --> 02:06:30.660
I'm telling you I know it's true

02:06:30.660 --> 02:06:34.660
That I'd die for you, die for you

02:06:34.660 --> 02:06:39.660
Baby, let's love, love, love again and again

02:06:39.660 --> 02:06:42.660
Tonight everything's alright

02:06:42.660 --> 02:06:45.660
It's too almost here

02:06:45.660 --> 02:06:48.660
Remember sweet, sweet love

02:07:48.660 --> 02:07:52.660
Life's wire, your powder's dry

02:07:52.660 --> 02:07:56.660
Another fire and I'll blow you sky high

02:07:58.660 --> 02:08:00.660
I'll blow you sky high

02:08:03.660 --> 02:08:06.660
No cues to a sonic boom

02:08:06.660 --> 02:08:10.660
I feel a tremor at shakin' the room

02:08:12.660 --> 02:08:14.660
Shakin' the room

02:08:14.660 --> 02:08:23.660
Everybody, are you ready for the beat back?

02:08:24.660 --> 02:08:30.660
Everybody, are you ready for the master blaster?

02:08:31.660 --> 02:08:35.660
I won't need you where I'm going

02:08:35.660 --> 02:08:43.660
I don't need you, where I'm goin'

02:08:48.660 --> 02:08:53.660
All I'll leave behind is a drain of dust

02:08:53.660 --> 02:09:01.660
All I'll leave behind is a trail of dust

02:09:05.660 --> 02:09:08.660
Are you ready?

02:09:08.660 --> 02:09:15.660
For the master blaster, oh!

02:10:08.660 --> 02:10:13.660
yeah

02:10:13.660 --> 02:10:18.660
yeah

02:10:18.660 --> 02:10:23.660
yeah

02:10:23.660 --> 02:10:28.660
yeah

02:10:28.660 --> 02:10:33.660
yeah

02:12:03.660 --> 02:12:33.460
Hello, we are back and you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 68 in

02:13:03.460 --> 02:13:05.460
Dude, it's like a guy show.

02:13:33.460 --> 02:13:37.620
highlight of DDR it's alright but the thing is is that like do we need to hear

02:13:37.620 --> 02:13:43.980
like before you anymore or d2r or whatever was all those songs in there

02:13:43.980 --> 02:13:47.260
like we've heard those so many times we don't need them again yeah I agree now

02:13:47.260 --> 02:13:52.540
you can make some new before you remix type stuff okay anyway do you have any

02:13:52.540 --> 02:13:58.800
thoughts on that movie it was okay I don't know I just I could see them

02:13:58.800 --> 02:14:07.320
putting this in like another version of DDR just as a thing okay cool the other

02:14:07.320 --> 02:14:12.080
song we heard in that break was good cool featuring Jeff coot with blame I'm

02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:20.200
sorry not blame that was their other song this was a blaster what do you guys

02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:27.440
think of blaster I don't know about blaster but hi angel what'd you think of

02:14:27.440 --> 02:14:37.280
I am a huge Jeff Koot fan dude, he makes me warm and gooey inside.

02:14:37.280 --> 02:14:45.980
It's nothing compared to his turning the motor over, or blame, or blowing my heart away,

02:14:45.980 --> 02:14:50.960
but since it's Jeff Koot I'll still deal with the fact that it's stupid hair rock.

02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:53.460
Yeah, it was total butt rock to me.

02:14:53.460 --> 02:14:55.860
It would be good in Guitar Freaks and Drummania.

02:14:55.860 --> 02:14:59.500
It was Total Guitar at My Ass Rock, that's what it was.

02:14:59.500 --> 02:15:03.860
I still say they need to put Roller Coaster of Luck in Fucking Guitar Freak.

02:15:03.860 --> 02:15:04.860
By Jeffy.

02:15:04.860 --> 02:15:05.860
That's true.

02:15:05.860 --> 02:15:11.260
Yeah, I, whatever, I mean, I like the Chili Pepper version, though.

02:15:11.260 --> 02:15:13.900
That's, yeah, that'd be cool, but.

02:15:13.900 --> 02:15:14.900
Yeah.

02:15:14.900 --> 02:15:18.460
And they should have a Be as in Butthead video in the background, because it was in the movie,

02:15:18.460 --> 02:15:19.460
I think.

02:15:19.460 --> 02:15:21.340
Well, I think they were in the, well, the video was animated, I think.

02:15:21.340 --> 02:15:23.340
Yeah, it was, actually, yeah.

02:15:23.340 --> 02:15:24.340
Yeah.

02:15:24.340 --> 02:15:31.340
somebody in the chat room says jeff cooch

02:15:32.500 --> 02:15:37.420
also in that break we heard Taka and DJW coming together as Iconoclasm

02:15:37.420 --> 02:15:40.500
with a song called and this is kind of tricky it's

02:15:40.500 --> 02:15:42.640
Vatum Stellarum

02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:47.760
a little bit of latin there

02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:51.900
what did you think of the Taka and DJW one?

02:15:51.900 --> 02:15:53.780
uh... i like DJ Taka

02:15:53.780 --> 02:16:01.780
But he's been bringing out a lot of more generic stuff lately, and I think he kind of poisoned DJW with that generic-ness he's been bringing out.

02:16:01.780 --> 02:16:04.780
So I'm not blown away by this song, but it is still pretty good.

02:16:04.780 --> 02:16:09.780
It's no Rainbow Flyer, which I think is the best song he's done in a long time.

02:16:09.780 --> 02:16:11.780
Because it has the word rainbow in it.

02:16:11.780 --> 02:16:19.780
Oh, shut up. But it is decent, I guess. But it sounds just like emotion.

02:16:19.780 --> 02:16:25.780
I don't hear DJW really in it at all. If you had just told me it was a DJ Talka song, I would have believed you.

02:16:25.780 --> 02:16:27.780
You would have what?

02:16:27.780 --> 02:16:30.780
I would have believed you if you had just told me it was a DJ Talka song, I would have believed you.

02:16:30.780 --> 02:16:39.780
Well yeah, the DJW part is very subtle. If I can recall, I heard some quick piano-y stuff in there. That's kind of like a DJW thing to do.

02:16:39.780 --> 02:16:43.780
Really fast piano playing is DJW's thing.

02:16:43.780 --> 02:16:45.780
Did you have any thoughts on that, Loki?

02:16:45.780 --> 02:16:50.780
It was okay. I liked it. It sounded kind of trancey and nice.

02:16:50.780 --> 02:16:58.780
I don't know, Taka just hasn't really... I just don't really care about Taka and Tack anymore.

02:16:58.780 --> 02:17:03.780
It's like Tack did better stuff on his album, you know, the remixes, like paranoia and stuff,

02:17:03.780 --> 02:17:08.780
than the actual stuff that he does in, you know, the arcade versions.

02:17:08.780 --> 02:17:11.780
It's like they kind of waste themselves on their albums.

02:17:11.780 --> 02:17:18.040
I think DJ Taka's last really, really good song was Stuff Off, maybe Rainbow Flyer was

02:17:18.040 --> 02:17:19.040
the last really good song.

02:17:19.040 --> 02:17:23.000
Like, Fifth Mix was good for both of them, I mean, that was some good stuff.

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:24.000
Was it DR Fifth Mix?

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:25.000
No, Beatmania.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:26.000
Beatmania Fifth Mix?

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:27.000
Or 2DX, I mean.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:28.000
Oh, Fifth Style.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:29.000
Fifth Style, yeah.

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:30.000
Like, what songs?

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:31.000
I can't...

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:32.000
V?

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Yeah, like, Absolut was on there.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:37.320
Well, Absolut's from, yeah, Third.

02:17:37.320 --> 02:17:38.320
Whatever.

02:18:08.320 --> 02:18:13.080
That stuff is so generic and repetitive sounding.

02:18:13.080 --> 02:18:14.080
Why does it have to be Naoki Underground?

02:18:14.080 --> 02:18:16.440
Why don't you just say Naoki?

02:18:16.440 --> 02:18:18.720
That's as old as generic as you get right there.

02:18:18.720 --> 02:18:24.520
Well, at least he does different genres of music even though he may put himself under

02:18:24.520 --> 02:18:26.520
different names and stuff.

02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:32.560
Well, DJ Taka's been doing a lot of, like with Night Style, these more J-Poppy sounding

02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:36.200
songs lately, so he's kind of changing up the genre, but I don't think he's doing very

02:18:36.200 --> 02:18:37.200
good.

02:18:37.200 --> 02:18:39.200
Sylvia Drive ever again.

02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:42.200
I was pissed off that they did even Emotion 2003 anyways.

02:18:42.200 --> 02:18:45.200
They've already done a romantic style of Emotion.

02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:47.200
That was in, what was it?

02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:48.200
Corey.

02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:51.200
They made romantic style and that was pretty cool.

02:18:51.200 --> 02:18:52.200
I like that better than the original.

02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:54.200
But then they're like, we need it to be a little more trancy.

02:18:54.200 --> 02:18:58.200
So let's do romantic 2003 or whatever it's called.

02:18:58.200 --> 02:18:59.200
Lame.

02:18:59.200 --> 02:19:02.200
Yeah, I think it was a little overdone.

02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:04.200
So what are we talking about?

02:19:04.200 --> 02:19:08.200
Well, you guys are having an argument about whether Taka sold out or not, or whatever it is.

02:19:08.200 --> 02:19:09.200
Well, I think Taka's just getting soft.

02:19:09.200 --> 02:19:10.200
Alright.

02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:14.200
Okay, let's do the FUs of the Week then, speaking of ranting about things.

02:19:14.200 --> 02:19:15.200
I'll leave now.

02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:17.200
It's time for the FUs of the Week.

02:19:23.200 --> 02:19:25.200
Oh, look at that.

02:19:25.200 --> 02:19:26.200
Here is justice.

02:19:26.200 --> 02:19:28.200
Here is punishment.

02:19:28.200 --> 02:19:30.200
Here is...

02:19:30.200 --> 02:19:32.200
This is fucked up.

02:19:32.200 --> 02:19:37.880
Well, this is the part where Jamie would usually do her FUs, because this is her little retarded

02:19:37.880 --> 02:19:44.120
baby that has grown into an hour-long segment every week's show, but she didn't send me

02:19:44.120 --> 02:19:49.240
anything over mail, or I haven't gotten anything on email, and I didn't get a phone call or

02:19:49.240 --> 02:19:50.240
anything.

02:19:50.240 --> 02:19:52.920
So, FU to Jamie for not sending me FUs!

02:19:52.920 --> 02:19:54.920
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we'd miss you.

02:19:54.920 --> 02:19:55.920
I'll do Jamie's.

02:19:55.920 --> 02:19:56.920
Alright.

02:19:56.920 --> 02:20:00.920
Fuck you to traffic, fuck you to being sick, fuck you to Xbox, there you go.

02:20:00.920 --> 02:20:07.920
Fuck you to bad Chinese food, fuck you to Roswell Golf Land children.

02:20:30.920 --> 02:20:35.120
Christmas music is even worse, because I hate Christmas music. Why the hell does every

02:20:35.120 --> 02:20:40.200
store in the face of the earth have to play goddamn Christmas music like right after fucking

02:20:40.200 --> 02:20:47.200
Halloween, okay? It's not Christmas yet. I hate that fucking music. Stupid dance media

02:20:49.360 --> 02:20:54.000
is... What is the draw with speed music? Why do people like speed music? It's just like

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:58.600
a song crammed down your throat. It's like fucking taking a beer bong and filling it

02:20:58.600 --> 02:21:03.840
music and that's what it is you're engulfing the whole song in like a few

02:21:03.840 --> 02:21:07.980
seconds but no you know instead of having the songs nice and short they

02:21:07.980 --> 02:21:12.160
have to know make extended versions and just speed them twice as fast of their

02:21:12.160 --> 02:21:21.600
regular size your boss hey now you're a rock star get your game on oh sorry

02:21:21.600 --> 02:21:28.600
My second F.U. of the week is going to be going to G4 for their poor programming.

02:21:28.600 --> 02:21:35.600
I watched a nice segment on Dance Dance Revolution and these people covering it knew nothing about the game.

02:21:35.600 --> 02:21:37.600
I don't think anything knew what they were doing there.

02:21:37.600 --> 02:21:39.600
They were talking to these people asking them,

02:21:39.600 --> 02:21:41.600
So, what's your highest score?

02:21:41.600 --> 02:21:43.600
And the guy's looking at them like,

02:21:43.600 --> 02:21:46.600
What the hell? What are you? Huh?

02:21:46.600 --> 02:21:50.600
He just had a confused look on his face and it was just awful.

02:21:50.600 --> 02:21:56.600
Also, FU, that stupid game Tetris Worlds, not every game needs to have a story.

02:21:56.600 --> 02:22:02.600
Tetris is not meant to have a story. It is a puzzle game. No story needed, you play the game.

02:22:02.600 --> 02:22:05.600
Dude, have you seen the new Tetris game? Aeris dies.

02:22:05.600 --> 02:22:12.600
It's just stupid, it's like, we have to recolonize our planet. It's not a planet, it's a puzzle game.

02:22:12.600 --> 02:22:16.600
Puzzle game. No need for anything else.

02:22:16.600 --> 02:22:23.600
2. Who wants to watch Russell Crowe be a stupid sailor?

02:22:46.600 --> 02:22:51.600
kostjamrh No, that's not worth saying.

02:23:16.600 --> 02:23:42.600
I hate them to hell and old people just really suck. I hate reality TV because these new shows that they come up with like this stupid bitch that has to marry some ugly guy. I don't really care if she has to marry an ugly guy because you know what? Ugly people are all over the world and people get married every day. So there's ugly people getting married to hot people all the time.

02:23:42.600 --> 02:23:47.600
quackparty2...

02:24:12.600 --> 02:24:18.880
also just they have like studies about like different things like games are

02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:27.720
addictive you know that's it it's really lame like this is what I'm saying if you set

02:24:27.720 --> 02:24:35.240
fire to yourself it will hurt so I'm done

02:24:35.240 --> 02:24:41.200
I like boobies too but just because I like boobies doesn't mean you have to

02:24:41.200 --> 02:24:48.200
keep writing movies

02:24:51.420 --> 02:24:54.760

02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:01.680

02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:06.180
think of something else real fast i'm dealing with some things in the chatroom hold on

02:25:06.180 --> 02:25:13.180
Let's watch some gay porn so we can get our hate back.

02:25:36.180 --> 02:25:41.180
The only spam I get is TUBGIRL!

02:26:11.180 --> 02:26:12.180
What's your email?

02:26:12.180 --> 02:26:15.340
I, well, I'm not going to give it out over the air, because who knows, and everybody's

02:26:15.340 --> 02:26:18.180
going to send me Tug Girl, because they think it'll be funny.

02:26:18.180 --> 02:26:21.180
Okay, everybody, go to www.goatsay.cx.

02:26:21.180 --> 02:26:30.220
Jesus Christ, just kill your, oh, that's it, my turn, my turn.

02:26:30.220 --> 02:26:34.260
My old few of the week goes to these fucking retarded internet jokes that are five years

02:26:34.260 --> 02:26:35.260
old.

02:26:35.260 --> 02:26:42.260
Hey, go to Goatsay, it's funny. This guy is stretching his ass.

02:26:42.260 --> 02:26:43.260
God.

02:26:43.260 --> 02:26:49.260
Top Girl, oh, it's so funny. Hey, she shit herself, isn't that great? Look at that.

02:26:49.260 --> 02:26:52.260
God, shut the fuck up.

02:26:52.260 --> 02:26:59.260
If you're going to send around an internet joke, at least make it a funny internet joke, like Ghetto Barbie or whatever that once came out.

02:26:59.260 --> 02:27:08.260
No, I'm sorry. I know a lot of people hate it still, but you can't go wrong with All Your Base. It's a classic. It's the original.

02:27:08.260 --> 02:27:12.260
This is funny because Japanese people actually wrote this this way.

02:27:12.260 --> 02:27:16.260
All Your Base was not part of my F.U. That can stay.

02:27:16.260 --> 02:27:17.260
Okay, thank you.

02:27:17.260 --> 02:27:19.260
But Don't Say and all this other stuff has to go.

02:27:19.260 --> 02:27:21.260
Yes, that's done.

02:27:21.260 --> 02:27:23.260
Or at least come up with something else funny.

02:27:23.260 --> 02:27:29.980
Well, there's like, you know, how about how about a woman in a new compromising position or a guy doing another amazing thing to her body?

02:27:33.580 --> 02:27:36.140
Okay, send me that no one sent me that yet

02:27:36.780 --> 02:27:42.440
There's there's the new fetish where women kick guys full-on in the groin really hard and they get off on it

02:27:42.440 --> 02:27:47.980
That'll probably be a new joke. Yes, somebody send me bum fights. I haven't seen this yet. It might still be funny. See?

02:27:49.740 --> 02:27:51.740
All right, God

02:27:51.740 --> 02:28:00.660
I just hate it when people post this on forums to try to, like, there's something new that

02:28:00.660 --> 02:28:03.500
you're like, huh, this is so funny, my friend just showed it to me.

02:28:03.500 --> 02:28:08.380
Chances are, if your friend just showed it to you, it's like five years old, your friend's

02:28:08.380 --> 02:28:09.380
just retarded.

02:28:09.380 --> 02:28:10.380
Unless you're mean.

02:28:10.380 --> 02:28:12.380
Have you seen part putting?

02:28:12.380 --> 02:28:15.840
No, God, I don't want to.

02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:20.540
My favorite ones are the ones where they post stuff like about new DDR extreme skin for

Fuck you to stupid customers that come into games, stop asking about six billion video

02:29:58.860 --> 02:30:02.260
games, and have them tell you everything that's new, and then they decide they don't want

02:30:02.260 --> 02:30:03.260
that game.

02:30:03.260 --> 02:30:05.380
They want Halo for the Xbox.

02:30:05.380 --> 02:30:08.160
Fuck you to stupid people, bad drivers.

02:30:08.160 --> 02:30:09.160
Fuck you to angry drivers.

02:30:09.160 --> 02:30:11.460
Don't know what I'm talking about if you're listening.

02:30:11.460 --> 02:30:12.460

02:30:12.460 --> 02:30:16.460

This group is called Movie Gallery.

02:30:39.460 --> 02:31:07.460
Vambulus, your FUs. Do you have any FUs of the week?

02:31:09.460 --> 02:31:14.980
I like to outsource everything to India, to save money, they put all people out of jobs

02:31:14.980 --> 02:31:15.980
and they all wander around.

02:31:15.980 --> 02:31:21.260
It makes it nice for when I'm hiring, but it still sucks when people are out of jobs.

02:31:21.260 --> 02:31:28.940
If you do lots of bills, if you do triple car tax, my truck tax bill came in this month

02:31:28.940 --> 02:31:30.940
and I owe $600.

02:31:30.940 --> 02:31:32.940
Oh my God!

02:31:32.940 --> 02:31:35.940
Yep, it tripled.

02:31:35.940 --> 02:31:39.940
If it's tripled, Square Brides Princesses is tripled.

02:31:39.940 --> 02:31:42.940
How about...

02:31:42.940 --> 02:31:44.940
That's all I have, because I can't think of anything.

02:31:44.940 --> 02:31:45.940
Alright, fair enough.

02:31:45.940 --> 02:31:49.940
Bradley, Arkadian42, what are your FUs of the week?

02:31:49.940 --> 02:31:55.940
Fuck you to be on the edge of out of money and all that other stuff and various things like that as usual.

Fuck you to not have any dog yet.

We're not getting the dog yet.

02:32:01.940 --> 02:32:03.940
Fuck you to bad drivers of course.

02:32:03.940 --> 02:32:07.460
The guy always tried to hit me when he was chasing lanes, but I think the cops caught

02:32:07.460 --> 02:32:12.460
him saying, fuck you to him, and thank you to the cops for catching that idiot, uh, fuck

02:32:12.460 --> 02:32:17.460
you to disappearing pencils, and he just ran away from me and disappeared to different

02:32:17.460 --> 02:32:22.460
rooms saying, where do the people go to when they have, like, more pencils than they disappear

02:32:22.460 --> 02:32:30.460
in various ways, and, uh, work, and, uh, say it again.

02:32:30.460 --> 02:32:34.460
Hey, um, up next, let's hear from Zero, your FUs of the Week.

02:33:00.460 --> 02:33:04.460
It didn't matter because I wanted to get out of it. I needed to take a break anyway.

02:33:04.460 --> 02:33:09.460
Um, uh, because we were out.

02:33:09.460 --> 02:33:16.460
Um, yeah, fuck you to having a car now because I have to go and fucking park all the way at Cal Expo

02:33:16.460 --> 02:33:23.460
because the stupid fucking mall security little fucking police squad dropouts

02:33:23.460 --> 02:33:26.460
come up and harass our store specifically and tell us

02:33:26.460 --> 02:33:30.460
If you park your cars anywhere else with Calitro, we're gonna tow it.

02:33:30.460 --> 02:33:33.460
And they're, like, picking on us, so we're making their job harder.

02:33:35.460 --> 02:33:42.460
Yes, and fuck you to people who tell me to fuck you because I'm getting, like, a TV and a computer.

02:33:42.460 --> 02:33:45.460
You know what? Those are gifts. Dick.

02:33:45.460 --> 02:33:47.460
Anyways...

02:33:47.460 --> 02:33:50.460
Jason! You're a dick!

02:33:50.460 --> 02:33:55.460
And by the way, that stuff that I'm getting is a gift, so fuck off.

02:33:55.460 --> 02:34:00.460
Not like you don't get to benefit from it anyway, so shut up.

02:34:25.460 --> 02:34:30.460
p0k3smot42o you can have a line sugi

02:34:55.460 --> 02:34:56.460
Oh wow.

02:34:56.460 --> 02:34:57.460
Alright.

02:34:57.460 --> 02:34:58.460
FUs please.

02:34:58.460 --> 02:35:03.460
Okay, uh, of course the old classic FU does this segment, it's stupid, um, and to be the

02:35:03.460 --> 02:35:06.460
great hypocrisy type thing, you know, I'll go ahead and give another FU.

02:35:06.460 --> 02:35:12.020
FU to you people who complain about G4, at least you got the money to or have G4, like

02:35:12.020 --> 02:35:16.980
and have cable, cause I have to watch the same three channels over and over again.

02:35:16.980 --> 02:35:20.140
Thank you network local television.

02:35:20.140 --> 02:35:24.500
But then again I do get at least CSI and cheaters.

02:35:24.500 --> 02:35:25.500
What's this?

02:35:25.500 --> 02:35:26.500
Hell yeah.

02:35:26.500 --> 02:35:32.060
Fuck both of you because my TV doesn't even get the reception for those three channels.

02:35:32.060 --> 02:35:36.940
Mine doesn't, my TV doesn't, but they have like this little cable thing that's an antenna

02:35:36.940 --> 02:35:41.060
that's like this huge, supposed to be a huge antenna on top of the whole apartment complex,

02:35:41.060 --> 02:35:42.260
but you know what I think it is?

02:35:42.260 --> 02:35:46.740
It's just like a piece of tin foil that's attached to this cable because I cannot get

02:35:46.740 --> 02:35:52.080
Fox, like hardly ever, which sucks because Fox has like I think Simpsons on it and stuff

02:35:52.080 --> 02:35:59.080
and

02:35:59.580 --> 02:36:02.300
but anyhow

02:36:02.300 --> 02:36:06.540

02:36:06.540 --> 02:36:08.760

What do they know just kidding just kidding just kidding if you lose it what?

02:37:56.900 --> 02:38:01.900
Just scares me with pictures of Kelly Osbourne, and why why does he have them on his computer? That's what I want to know

02:38:01.900 --> 02:38:04.660
Oh my god. It's a new picture of Kelly Osbourne

02:38:05.180 --> 02:38:08.780
I accidentally downloaded her album because it came up as such an elf

02:38:10.940 --> 02:38:17.340
You guys are so gullible like three guys took up the gym. Oh my god. You'd picture Kelly Osbourne. She's like 17 you perverts

02:38:17.340 --> 02:38:21.340
That's exactly why I want to see it.

02:38:21.340 --> 02:38:25.340
Dude, it's like fruit. You want it just before it's ripe and ready to be eaten.

02:38:25.340 --> 02:38:29.340
Oh my God!

02:38:29.340 --> 02:38:33.340
She got

02:38:33.340 --> 02:38:37.340
ripe a little early, okay?

02:38:37.340 --> 02:38:41.340
DJ Specter would like to say, F you, my stupid Spanish teacher

02:38:41.340 --> 02:38:45.340

I got the F.U. Depaltaire. I guess that was it.

02:39:47.340 --> 02:39:49.340
Can I get one more?

02:39:49.340 --> 02:39:55.340
Baca wants to give an F.U. to a family member who will not let him listen to the rest of the show.

02:39:55.340 --> 02:39:58.340
So it did me no good to read that because he's not listening anymore.

02:39:58.340 --> 02:40:00.340
That's too bad.

02:40:00.340 --> 02:40:05.340
Nothing comes between you and your Orange Lounge radio, God damn it.

02:40:05.340 --> 02:40:06.340
All right.

02:40:06.340 --> 02:40:08.340
That's it. We're done with the F.U.s of the week.

02:40:08.340 --> 02:40:11.340
Don't send me more. I don't want to hear them.

02:40:11.340 --> 02:40:16.340
Alright, we're going to do another break of Poppin' Music 10 stuff.

02:40:16.340 --> 02:40:17.340
So here it is.

02:40:17.340 --> 02:40:19.460
In this break you're going to hear, I know a lot of you guys have been looking forward

02:40:19.460 --> 02:40:22.140
to this one, the Dez Q and Tac song.

02:40:22.140 --> 02:40:27.140
Dez Q with Jack is the first song we're going to hear.

02:40:27.140 --> 02:40:31.100
And we're going to hear Girls Band, it's a genre called Girls Band.

02:40:31.100 --> 02:40:32.420
It's Milk.

02:40:32.420 --> 02:40:33.420
Kind of like the character.

02:40:33.420 --> 02:40:34.420
Milk.

02:40:34.420 --> 02:40:37.300
Threep with Milk and then we're going to hear another Dez Q song because I know they have

02:40:37.300 --> 02:40:39.860
so many fanboys and girls thanks to Dyke and Kai.

02:40:39.860 --> 02:40:45.860
We'll hear another Dez Row song featuring Shingon with the place to be, and it's a genre

02:40:45.860 --> 02:40:46.860
called Core Groove.

02:40:46.860 --> 02:40:51.140
So enjoy this new set of pop music, 10 music, starting with Dez Q.

02:40:51.140 --> 02:40:58.140
You're listening to Orange Launch Radio. Thanks!

02:41:21.140 --> 02:41:36.140
I need to take one, to take many more Souls, the rage, I can't bear it, can't make it grow

02:41:36.140 --> 02:41:40.140
Don't let me down, this is a dream life

02:41:40.140 --> 02:41:42.140
I can't shake you anymore

02:42:42.140 --> 02:43:08.060
Oh, I don't know how to own

02:43:08.060 --> 02:43:27.940
Gada logan genki ni narutame ni okihima wai sakashini ugu

02:43:27.940 --> 02:43:34.940
Do-gi-do-gi, yo-i-mi-chi-si-te

02:43:34.940 --> 02:43:41.940
Kon-e koto, jare-a atari

02:43:41.940 --> 02:43:45.940
I've been waiting for you

02:43:45.940 --> 02:43:49.940
I'll never see you again

02:43:49.940 --> 02:43:56.940
I'll never see you again

02:43:58.940 --> 02:44:02.940
If I had you, I wouldn't have had you

02:44:02.940 --> 02:44:06.940
If I had you, I wouldn't have had you

02:46:36.940 --> 02:46:43.940
Mr. Random person on the street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think

02:47:06.940 --> 02:47:09.940
What do you think of the Orange Lounge Big Money Music and More show?

02:47:09.940 --> 02:47:16.940
The music is like being transported to this dancing spaceship place.

02:47:16.940 --> 02:47:22.940
It's unearthly. It's like being at a club, except you don't have to ask someone to dance.

02:47:22.940 --> 02:47:25.940
Alright, we're back on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:47:25.940 --> 02:47:30.940
I'm opening up the floor for some quick Ask Orange Lounge before we go off air tonight.

02:47:30.940 --> 02:47:34.940
But first, while you guys send those questions in over private message to Sky,

02:47:34.940 --> 02:47:38.140
Let's see what you guys thought of those songs.

02:47:38.140 --> 02:47:40.580
The Chat Room certainly had some strong opinion on these.

02:47:40.580 --> 02:47:44.700
The first song we heard in that break was Dez Q, that's Dez Row and Tac, with a song

02:47:44.700 --> 02:47:45.700
called Jack.

02:47:45.700 --> 02:47:52.700
Um, Brad, what did you think of that?

02:47:52.700 --> 02:47:54.780
The Dez Q with Jack.

02:47:54.780 --> 02:47:55.780
I like it.

02:47:55.780 --> 02:47:58.580
It's distress and freaking gravity mixed together.

02:47:58.580 --> 02:47:59.580
You know what's interesting?

02:47:59.580 --> 02:48:02.540
The Chat Room worst reviews of the night.

02:48:02.540 --> 02:48:04.060
They said that song is god-awful.

02:48:04.060 --> 02:48:12.540
don't like it at all. Fuck them. This shit isn't for them. Big fuck you to the chat room.

02:48:12.540 --> 02:48:20.100
You know what? I don't think it's awful, but for TAC, it's pretty bad. I expect better

02:48:20.100 --> 02:48:30.180
from TAC. So that's me personally. Why don't you go sit on a dick or two? If I could. Oh,

02:48:30.180 --> 02:48:35.180
Oh, oh, hey, it looks like, uh, Bunch of When I Lost was offering.

02:48:35.180 --> 02:48:36.180
I'll close my eyes.

02:48:36.180 --> 02:48:39.180
Uh, Loki, what'd you think of Dez Q?

02:48:39.180 --> 02:48:45.180
It's okay, it's just like every other fucking tax song on the face of the earth, they all sound the same now.

02:48:45.180 --> 02:48:50.180
Um, I should remix it, I guess. That'd be fun.

02:48:50.180 --> 02:48:51.180
Alright.

02:48:51.180 --> 02:48:56.180
Uh, anybody else have a thought on Dez Q with Jack?

02:48:56.180 --> 02:48:57.180
What?

02:48:57.180 --> 02:48:59.180
I should just listen to Captain Jack.

02:48:59.180 --> 02:49:01.680
Yes, Captain Jack is much better than Jack, in my opinion.

02:49:01.680 --> 02:49:03.680
It does queue with Captain Jack.

02:49:03.680 --> 02:49:05.180
Oh!

02:49:05.180 --> 02:49:07.180
Oh!

02:49:07.180 --> 02:49:09.680
The next song we heard was a band called Threep,

02:49:09.680 --> 02:49:13.180
and the song was called Milk.

02:49:13.180 --> 02:49:16.180
A nice, happy little uplifting song.

02:49:16.180 --> 02:49:18.180
I remember that movie.

02:49:18.180 --> 02:49:20.180
Anyway, that was Milk Money.

02:49:20.180 --> 02:49:22.680
Where they, like, saved up their milk money to go to a prostitute.

02:49:22.680 --> 02:49:26.180
That was cool.

02:49:26.180 --> 02:49:30.680
That has nothing to do with the song. Nothing at all, Loki.

02:49:30.680 --> 02:49:34.180
Uh, Brad, did you have a thought on Girls Band With Milk?

02:49:34.180 --> 02:49:36.180
I wasn't paying attention to that song, sorry.

02:49:36.180 --> 02:49:43.180
Well, what the fuck? Pay attention.

02:49:43.180 --> 02:49:48.680
Alright, um, let's see what you guys thought of Desrow featuring Shingon with, uh...

02:49:48.680 --> 02:49:50.180
Oh, what the hell's the name of this song?

02:49:50.180 --> 02:49:51.980
The Place To Be!

02:49:51.980 --> 02:49:54.740
and the certainly those you that were visiting the money stop for a while

02:49:54.740 --> 02:49:59.260
probably got fucking sick of this song really fast yep it's just a few of the

02:49:59.260 --> 02:50:01.380
whole thing

02:50:01.380 --> 02:50:03.540
uh... you say it

02:50:03.540 --> 02:50:07.300
well after that reason only met up and i forgot some

02:50:07.300 --> 02:50:10.580
fuck you but my server so the music on your opening page

02:50:10.580 --> 02:50:12.580
yep they hate you know what

02:50:12.580 --> 02:50:14.120
i love the money style

02:50:14.120 --> 02:50:17.900
got a good guy that runs it can i ask you how i think that's a great site good

02:50:17.900 --> 02:50:19.420
stuff but i don't like that

02:50:19.420 --> 02:50:24.040
choice to put the music on the opening page and the biggest problem is if it

02:50:24.040 --> 02:50:27.280
would be nice here's a suggestion for my spell folks if you're listening instead

02:50:27.280 --> 02:50:31.160
of having the one song in there and changing it every two weeks or so put

02:50:31.160 --> 02:50:35.920
like ten songs that randomize so every time I heard that no better yet turn off

02:50:35.920 --> 02:50:39.560
the fucking music I get it do it do you know maniacs did it's it's got like a

02:50:39.560 --> 02:50:44.620
cookie on your computer okay you if you disable it it doesn't play until you

02:50:44.620 --> 02:50:48.340
enable it again and it does it automatically and I love that otherwise

02:50:48.340 --> 02:50:53.340
nice, great sight. Or even better, just have it load Orange Lounge Radio when they go to

02:50:53.340 --> 02:50:57.100
the front page. Just have it load. The problem is the thing to turn it off, it takes a while

02:50:57.100 --> 02:51:03.940
to load up after no animations and stuff. Bad business decision, whoever did that. Brad,

02:51:03.940 --> 02:51:11.020
what did you think of that song? The Desiro, core groove genre one that got played the

02:51:11.020 --> 02:51:15.580
hell out on the Monty style? What did you think of the last half of it that you didn't

02:51:45.580 --> 02:51:47.580
I think I'm bored too.

02:52:15.580 --> 02:52:17.580
e-mail me

02:52:45.580 --> 02:52:53.660
Don't email Konami, they have a request on their website, click here to request a song

02:52:53.660 --> 02:52:54.660
for your donation.

02:52:54.660 --> 02:52:59.740
Here's the thing, if you really want to do it, try and get a hold of Short EMC or Shintenshi

02:52:59.740 --> 02:53:05.420
or any of those other old school Bay Area MGL guys from DDR, because they all work for

02:53:05.420 --> 02:53:09.820
fucking Konami right now, at least until like Christmas time because I hear they're getting

02:53:09.820 --> 02:53:10.820
laid off.

02:53:10.820 --> 02:53:13.060
But hey, while you're working there, why does Mo bug the shit out of them?

02:53:13.060 --> 02:53:17.940
My only thought is that if you're going to request a song like that, like the total gibberish

02:53:17.940 --> 02:53:24.980
song to be in Karaoke Revolution, Murmur Twins isn't funny.

02:53:24.980 --> 02:53:26.320
I think they're trying to be funny.

02:53:26.320 --> 02:53:30.240
I get the thing that it's trying to be funny, like, ooh, teehee, let's request Murmur Twins.

02:53:30.240 --> 02:53:31.240
It's not funny.

02:53:31.240 --> 02:53:35.660
Wouldn't it have been more funny to request Last Message, or?

02:53:35.660 --> 02:53:37.820
See, yes, Last Message I think would have been a little funny.

02:53:37.820 --> 02:53:38.820
Murmur Twins, not funny.

02:53:38.820 --> 02:53:41.360
I'd like to request DMX be put in DDR.

02:53:41.360 --> 02:53:44.920
I'd like to request that no Bamani songs be put in Karaoke Revolution so that we don't

02:53:44.920 --> 02:53:45.920
ruin the series.

02:53:45.920 --> 02:53:47.920
DMX, the singer, the rapper.

02:53:47.920 --> 02:53:49.320
No, I'm just saying.

02:53:49.320 --> 02:53:51.800
What the fuck are you talking about?

02:53:51.800 --> 02:53:58.720
Am I the only person who agrees that Konami's original music is better than 98% of the music

02:53:58.720 --> 02:53:59.720
that comes out nowadays?

02:53:59.720 --> 02:54:02.920
All I'm saying is that DDR music needs to stay in DDR.

02:54:02.920 --> 02:54:03.920
Check this shit out.

02:54:03.920 --> 02:54:04.920
DDR music needs to stay in DDR.

02:54:04.920 --> 02:54:06.300
It does not need to be in Karaoke Revolution.

02:54:06.300 --> 02:54:08.660
We like Karaoke Revolution because it has the pop songs in it.

02:54:08.660 --> 02:54:09.660
Check this out.

02:54:09.660 --> 02:54:15.660
A new version of Somba Money Game comes out, DDR, pop and music, or 2DX.

02:54:15.660 --> 02:54:18.660
People go, have you heard the new license tracks?

02:54:18.660 --> 02:54:22.660
I'm like, what, there's license tracks? I don't give a fuck. I like Konami's music.

02:54:22.660 --> 02:54:23.660
I like the license tracks.

02:54:23.660 --> 02:54:25.660
Yeah, because you're a consumer whore.

02:54:25.660 --> 02:54:27.660
Fuck off.

02:54:27.660 --> 02:54:30.660
Alright, can we actually answer the questions now?

02:54:30.660 --> 02:54:33.660
Hey, can I ask a question to the chatroom first?

02:54:33.660 --> 02:54:34.660
Yeah.

02:54:34.660 --> 02:54:39.660
Could I have everyone in the chat room who plays FF11 to please tell us what server they're on and their character name?

02:54:39.660 --> 02:54:40.660
I'm on Bismarck.

02:54:40.660 --> 02:54:44.660
Oh, Bismarck. Fuck Bismarck. Everyone jump over to Ragnarok.

02:54:44.660 --> 02:54:47.660
Fuck Ragnarok. There's already a game called Ragnarok.

02:54:47.660 --> 02:54:49.660
Yeah, well, there was a...

02:54:49.660 --> 02:54:53.660
Yeah, and fuck Ragnarok while we're at it.

02:54:53.660 --> 02:54:55.660
Yes, Ben?

02:54:55.660 --> 02:54:56.660
I don't know.

02:54:56.660 --> 02:54:58.660
Alright, let's get to the question.

02:54:58.660 --> 02:54:59.660
No, too late.

02:54:59.660 --> 02:55:03.660
Same question came from both 20th Magus and Zodiac Knight.

02:55:03.660 --> 02:55:08.340
Plus you to the player in Star Wars Galaxy who unlocked the first Jedi.

02:55:08.340 --> 02:55:10.180
You fucking grinding bastard.

02:55:10.180 --> 02:55:12.080
You like mastered every profession in the game.

02:55:12.080 --> 02:55:13.860
You suck ass.

02:55:13.860 --> 02:55:18.300
And fuck you to Sony online for making that the secret way to unlocking the goddamn Jedi

02:55:18.300 --> 02:55:19.300
character.

02:55:19.300 --> 02:55:20.300
Jealous?

02:55:20.300 --> 02:55:21.300
Table of one?

02:55:21.300 --> 02:55:22.300
Jealous?

02:55:22.300 --> 02:55:25.580
No, fuck that fucking piss off because it was just about grinding profession.

02:55:25.580 --> 02:55:28.720
It wasn't some super secret- I thought you enjoyed grinding.

02:55:28.720 --> 02:55:30.380
I do.

02:55:30.380 --> 02:55:36.020
your profession is when you just sit there and build biological chemical effectors all

02:55:36.020 --> 02:55:39.980
day long instead of actually playing the game. You just sit there building things forever.

02:55:39.980 --> 02:55:43.740
And it sucked because it was supposed to be some kind of cool, different way for everyone

02:55:43.740 --> 02:55:46.740
to unlock the AI and it was just mastery of four different professions.

02:55:46.740 --> 02:55:56.740
I don't give a shit. I don't get a few segments done. Alright, same question from Magus and

02:55:56.740 --> 02:55:58.740
zodiacknight asks the same question

02:55:58.740 --> 02:56:00.740
best song in karaoke revolution so far?

02:56:00.740 --> 02:56:02.740
they want to know

02:56:02.740 --> 02:56:04.740
zeroesaysnone

02:56:04.740 --> 02:56:06.740
loki

02:56:06.740 --> 02:56:08.740
you're the one that i want

02:56:08.740 --> 02:56:10.740
because it was in greece

02:56:10.740 --> 02:56:12.740
and she loves greece

02:56:12.740 --> 02:56:14.740
i really don't like much of the songs

02:56:14.740 --> 02:56:16.740
because i can't sing them

02:56:16.740 --> 02:56:18.740
so it kind of sucks

02:56:18.740 --> 02:56:20.740
i like jennifer lopez's waiting for the night

02:56:20.740 --> 02:56:22.740
because that's the only song i like of hers

02:56:22.740 --> 02:56:24.740
and then

02:56:24.740 --> 02:56:29.300
Broken Wings is alright because I listen to that all the time.

02:56:29.300 --> 02:56:35.740
As far as non-game music, I'd have to say Lady's Night, man.

02:56:35.740 --> 02:56:36.740
That's awesome.

02:56:36.740 --> 02:56:38.740
That's the first time we got Lady's Night.

02:56:38.740 --> 02:56:44.260
I would say it's a close tie between Like a Virgin, because I love singing that song

02:56:44.260 --> 02:56:48.020
because I'm so virginal in here, and Girls Just Want to Have Fun.

02:56:48.020 --> 02:56:49.220
Girls Just Want to Have Lunch.

02:56:49.220 --> 02:56:50.220
Yes.

02:56:50.220 --> 02:56:52.340
Both were weird-out parodies, too, so you can sing the parodies.

02:56:52.340 --> 02:56:56.340
The songs on there, I think, were parodied by Ria, complicated songs.

02:56:56.340 --> 02:57:00.340
Yeah, complicated is on there. And I like complicated, too, because it pisses Nelly off when I sing it.

02:57:00.340 --> 02:57:03.340
Brad, your favorite, because I know you've played the game, too?

02:57:03.340 --> 02:57:08.340
Well, it sure wasn't that friggin' Jennifer Lopez song. God, Matt, you faggot.

02:57:08.340 --> 02:57:13.340
Anyway, um, wait a minute, what am I talking about? My songs are pretty faggoty, too.

02:57:13.340 --> 02:57:21.340
I'd have to say, probably, I don't know, there's three really good ones on there. Bizarre Love Triangle, Huey Lewis in the News with Power of Love,

02:57:21.340 --> 02:57:29.020
of love, and, um, what was that other one I sang? I did the, the Hulu-less one, Bizarre

02:57:29.020 --> 02:57:32.780
Love Triangle was on there, and, what was it? There was another one, but yeah.

02:57:32.780 --> 02:57:34.220
Uh, it's the end of the world, does he know it?

02:57:34.220 --> 02:57:36.620
No, uh, no. REM isn't that great.

02:57:36.620 --> 02:57:37.980
Uh, you just saw me do it!

02:57:37.980 --> 02:57:39.020
Chain of Fools?

02:57:39.020 --> 02:57:42.060
No! Chain, chain, chain!

02:57:42.060 --> 02:57:42.620
I don't remember the other one.

02:57:42.620 --> 02:57:43.820
You're under where?

02:57:43.820 --> 02:57:45.580
I don't remember the other one you did, I'm sorry.

02:57:45.580 --> 02:57:49.500
Uh, frickin' A, I don't know, but yeah, you get it. You get the point. There's, there's

02:57:49.500 --> 02:57:50.620
some good songs on there, so.

02:57:50.620 --> 02:57:53.620
The one from Back to the Future was that you already said that one, right?

02:57:53.620 --> 02:57:55.620
I already said that. Power of Love. Power of Love.

02:57:55.620 --> 02:57:58.620
Alright, a couple more questions, both coming from Azie and Buddy Paul.

02:57:58.620 --> 02:58:00.620
These are the last two of the night, so no more questions for us.

02:58:00.620 --> 02:58:02.620
I'm hijacking. Here we go.

02:58:02.620 --> 02:58:03.620
I'm hijacking.

02:58:03.620 --> 02:58:04.620
Tef, Julian.

02:58:04.620 --> 02:58:05.620
This is a live show.

02:58:05.620 --> 02:58:09.620
We're coming to you live from the hizzle for shizzle.

02:58:09.620 --> 02:58:10.620
Weird dog.

02:58:10.620 --> 02:58:11.620
Such a piehole.

02:58:11.620 --> 02:58:12.620
Alright.

02:58:12.620 --> 02:58:16.620
Azie and Buddy Paul, have any of you had a near-death experience?

02:58:16.620 --> 02:58:17.620
This is a pretty heavy question.

02:58:17.620 --> 02:58:18.620
Yes.

02:58:18.620 --> 02:58:29.140
want to explain it? Hold on. Okay, I'll go first. I went on a groupish date with a friend

02:58:29.140 --> 02:58:35.260
of mine. It was this one guy and his date and my date. And he was driving his mom's,

02:58:35.260 --> 02:58:41.540
thank God, Grand Prix, Pontiac Grand Prix. And it was the first, yeah, well, I say thank

02:58:41.540 --> 02:58:48.580
God because the Grand Prix's actually hold up pretty well in a wreck. We went on a date

02:58:48.580 --> 02:58:51.300
We went to a movie then we came home and right after we got out of theater

02:58:51.300 --> 02:58:54.080
It was the first rain of the season so in the first rain of the season

02:58:54.460 --> 02:59:00.100
Everybody starts driving like complete idiots and since it's the first rain. There's a lot of fresh oil on the road

02:59:00.240 --> 02:59:03.860
So we're driving. He's driving too fast for conditions

02:59:04.740 --> 02:59:06.580
tailgating somebody and

02:59:06.580 --> 02:59:12.580
He's looking behind him talking to the two girls in the rear seat whereas. I'm the only one watching the street

02:59:12.620 --> 02:59:15.020
He's the one driving, but I'm the only one watching the street, so

02:59:15.020 --> 02:59:21.080
So some truck got an accident up ahead, they were parked in the middle of the fast lane,

02:59:21.080 --> 02:59:25.180
and I look and I say, oh shit, look out, stop, and so he turns his head just in time for

02:59:25.180 --> 02:59:30.140
him to swerve to the right a little bit, so only half of the car got hit, this truck with

02:59:30.140 --> 02:59:37.140
an iron bumper, it destroyed the front half, gave me some bruises, but if we had gone straight

02:59:37.140 --> 02:59:41.780
into it instead of to the side, we would have been under the truck and it would have decapitated

02:59:41.780 --> 02:59:43.540
all of us and we would have been dead.

02:59:43.540 --> 02:59:49.940
So thank you to me for saving these three worthless people's lives and myself.

02:59:49.940 --> 02:59:53.500
Mine's not as exciting as that, but it's a little closer to death.

02:59:53.500 --> 02:59:56.500
See, I actually died at 18 months old.

02:59:56.500 --> 02:59:57.500
I'm serious.

02:59:57.500 --> 02:59:59.580
I drowned, and I was pronounced dead.

02:59:59.580 --> 03:00:04.380
And I was out of my brain and stuff for five, ten minutes before my mom put the oxygen mask

03:00:04.380 --> 03:00:05.900
over me and somehow brought me back.

03:00:05.900 --> 03:00:06.900
But I actually died.

03:00:06.900 --> 03:00:07.900
I don't remember anything.

03:00:07.900 --> 03:00:08.900
I was too young.

03:00:08.900 --> 03:00:12.780
But apparently after that, when I came back, my mom taught me to swim pretty quick.

03:00:12.780 --> 03:00:15.140
interesting

03:00:15.140 --> 03:00:16.320
there is one time

03:00:16.320 --> 03:00:18.860
and then i said near death not death

03:00:18.860 --> 03:00:20.420
next time pay attention

03:00:20.420 --> 03:00:24.540
uh...

03:00:24.540 --> 03:00:25.820
and such a dick

03:00:25.820 --> 03:00:27.160
working at one

03:00:27.160 --> 03:00:28.780
uh... yeah sure

03:00:28.780 --> 03:00:32.420
uh... there is this one time where uh...

03:00:32.420 --> 03:00:33.420
i came home

03:00:33.420 --> 03:00:37.140
and like

03:00:37.140 --> 03:00:38.900
no

03:00:38.900 --> 03:00:46.340
No, there was one time I came home and we were out of Captain Crunch and I thought I

03:00:46.340 --> 03:00:53.620
was going to die right there.

03:00:53.620 --> 03:00:58.020
This one time I had to listen to Christmas Speed.

03:00:58.020 --> 03:00:59.580
Other question from Azie and Buddy Paul.

03:00:59.580 --> 03:01:00.700
This is pretty easily answered.

03:01:00.700 --> 03:01:03.340
What is the song we use for the Ask Orange Lounge theme music?

03:01:03.340 --> 03:01:06.260
We get asked this, I swear to God, every other week.

03:01:06.260 --> 03:01:13.260
This is Journey to the Wonderland from Keyboard Mania Second Mix by NPB.

03:01:36.260 --> 03:02:04.260
zer0, your final thought of the evening?

03:02:04.260 --> 03:02:08.860
metal slug just ain't metal slug without the blood

03:02:08.860 --> 03:02:10.740
my final thought of the evening is

03:02:10.740 --> 03:02:15.320
MORTAL COMBAT!

03:02:15.320 --> 03:02:20.280
and uh... Loki your final thought of the evening

03:02:20.280 --> 03:02:23.220
I had too much strawberry soda during this show

03:02:23.220 --> 03:02:26.780
I think I've had a whole six-fashioned... Does your pee smell like strawberries?

03:02:26.780 --> 03:02:32.100
I don't know! Let me get a thrower right now!

03:02:32.100 --> 03:02:38.100
Alright, I'm going to give the final word of the evening, one word, to sum up the whole show and we end on that note tonight.

03:02:38.100 --> 03:02:39.100
No, Dark Child.

03:02:39.100 --> 03:02:42.100
I give the final word of the night tonight to Vandalous.

03:02:42.100 --> 03:02:44.100
You can't have it, Dark Child. You don't get it.

03:02:44.100 --> 03:02:45.100
Goatsy.

03:02:45.100 --> 03:02:46.100
No. No goatsy.

03:02:46.100 --> 03:02:50.100
Vandalous gets the last word of the evening because I know he'll keep it clean.

03:02:50.100 --> 03:02:54.100
Vandalous, the final word of the evening tonight?

03:02:54.100 --> 03:02:56.100
Apple pie.

03:02:56.100 --> 03:02:59.100
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

03:02:59.100 --> 03:03:03.600
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sabra, Sky, and Loki.

03:03:03.600 --> 03:03:05.600
We expect you a nice play again.

03:03:05.600 --> 03:03:09.100
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:03:10.600 --> 03:03:14.600
Trying to save the relationship by talking about having a baby.

03:03:14.600 --> 03:03:16.600
You know, like, that's going to work.

03:03:16.600 --> 03:03:20.600
I had a great, great experience recently.

03:03:20.600 --> 03:03:24.100
I helped deliver one of my best friend's children.

03:03:24.100 --> 03:03:26.600
And, wow, when you witness something like that,

03:03:26.600 --> 03:03:31.880
You see how powerful women are, that we bring forth life.

03:03:31.880 --> 03:03:35.360
I mean, it's awesome.

03:03:35.360 --> 03:03:39.080
And I just was so amazed by my friend,

03:03:39.080 --> 03:03:41.240
because she was not just a woman.

03:03:41.240 --> 03:03:42.480
She was not just a mother.

03:03:42.480 --> 03:03:45.640
At that moment, she was creation.

03:03:45.640 --> 03:03:47.680
She was life.

03:03:47.680 --> 03:03:49.160
She was God.

03:03:49.160 --> 03:03:54.400
And as I looked in her eyes, her pussy exploded.

03:03:54.400 --> 03:04:17.640
a piece of it hit me in the head

03:04:17.640 --> 03:04:33.000
A piece of it hit me in the head!

03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:38.840
Everybody else was like holding each other and crying, and I'm like, I'm fucking with

03:04:38.840 --> 03:05:02.280
The nurse was running around collecting pieces of her pussy in a basket, she's just panning

03:05:02.280 --> 03:05:31.240
for pussy. They had to sew it back together.

03:05:31.240 --> 03:05:38.240
frankenpussy. IT'S ALIVE!
