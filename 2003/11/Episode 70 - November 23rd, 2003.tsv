76923	78944	And now for our feature presentation.
85068	88670	Orange Lounge Radio Live is now on the air.
89410	96134	Orange Lounge Radio Live is a live talk program dedicated to all things Bomani and Bensum.
96977	100259	Orange Lounge Radio may contain adult content.
100559	103140	You probably shouldn't let your children listen.
104241	112425	If you do let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio, they may turn into evil little demons from hell!
113846	117228	Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.
122210	126991	Now you see that evil will always triumph because good is dumb.
127231	129791	Trash, drunk, and stupid is no way to go through, sir.
130092	133652	He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body.
134592	137353	Well, makes you look like an ass is what he does, Ed.
137713	138433	Hamburgers!
139213	141374	The cornerstone of any nutritionist's practice.
141614	142414	That was huge.
143954	144554	Cool.
144894	147795	Do you mind if I take my new car for a ride?
151028	151969	DarkSakura DarkSakura
173551	174872	Any time, any place, baby.
175152	175672	Loki.
176152	177032	Ow, my foot!
177512	179693	Why did I shoot myself in my foot?
180113	181833	Orange Lounge Radio.
184214	190415	We are live, and this is episode number 70 for November the 23rd of 2003.
190495	197037	You're tuned in to the Bomani Scene's most underprepared radio station of all things being money.
198018	199879	My name is Rob Roberts, if you might know me as Sky.
199939	211946	Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, back from her three-week, two-week vacation, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers, you know her better, DarkSakura.
212206	214227	Hi, long time no talk, I'm cooking, bye.
214327	216469	Tonight she's Iron Chef Sakura right now.
218390	220611	In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.
220891	224053	Hello, I need to, what the hell?
224393	225434	The cords have just...
226804	227927	all mated with each other.
228849	232617	Loki picked up the microphone and it's like taking the Christmas lights out of the box on Christmas.
233539	234619	What the hell is this doing here?
234639	236380	There's like a ribbing cable.
236580	238541	This random printer cord is mixed in too.
239221	242303	Anyway, if we sound a little disorganized tonight, it's because we are.
242363	244343	We have Jamie over here cooking.
245004	248105	We have Loki over here, you know, trying to untangle the cords.
248185	250306	Me, I've been feeling kind of eh this evening.
250346	251166	I'll get into that later.
251566	253887	So I'm just like now getting with it.
253927	256648	My Tylenol is finally kicking in and I can like see again.
257709	262831	Also with us tonight, SayHello20 is here and I know there's no microphone.
265507	265928	Hey, what's up?
266228	266948	Hi, how you doing?
266988	267669	Long time no see.
268089	269110	I was here like two weeks ago.
269190	269991	How could it be that long?
270432	271152	Ah, long enough.
271472	271893	Oh, okay.
272253	273935	Now, what did you bring with you tonight?
275156	275936	It's a surprise.
276297	279179	Alright, don't get... If you really want me to tell them... Nah, tell them first break.
279540	279860	Alright.
280000	281181	Who else did you bring with you here?
281281	282482	Let's have her introduce herself.
283663	288688	Most people who are listening should know her if they go to RBGL, or actually did go to RBGL.
290333	294415	Yeah, but we're a worldwide show.
294455	295516	Yeah, that's right, huh?
295656	296737	Well, here she is.
297197	297517	Miko.
299298	299739	Hi.
300379	300959	How are you?
302140	302860	I'm fine.
302940	303521	How are you?
303901	304341	I'm good.
304401	306162	Welcome to our disorganized mess of a show.
308404	309224	Well, this is fun.
309244	309905	All right.
309925	312066	Well, hey, the fun's just about to start.
313635	315416	We haven't even gotten there yet.
315476	315736	All right.
316016	329220	We're going to take a quick break to try and organize ourselves, and we'll get that surprise ready, and we'll start off the show with it as soon as we come back after a little bit of this and a little bit of that from the Bomani world.
329240	329660	We'll be back.
393322	394886	Thanks for watching!
641946	643427	Hey, did you hear about that show?
643927	644507	What show?
644807	650270	Well, they play a lot of great Fermanian video game music, but if you listen to it, you have to listen to it again within seven days.
650670	651951	Oh, I've heard of that station.
652051	652371	Really?
652791	654892	Yeah, I even listened to it a couple weeks ago.
655372	657633	Hey, what happens to you if you don't listen to it again?
657833	658794	Well, you die.
659414	659954	I, what?
660774	664976	Hey, wait, what's this crazy bitch doing coming out of my computer screen?
665877	666057	Ahhhh!
667185	669847	Orange Lounge Radio, listen or die!
673269	677491	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 70.
679172	686477	If you want to join our chatroom, head on over to www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on chat, but I warn you guys, it is a fucking madhouse in there tonight.
686497	690539	There's a lot of people there, and I'm having a hard time keeping up with the chatroom, but...
692971	695373	and of course I'm trying to eat as well at the same time.
695633	696713	And Jamie, very delicious.
696773	697114	Good job.
697154	697474	Thank you.
698034	699255	And I usually don't eat fish.
699875	704598	I just made a confession earlier today in one of our buddies' live journal, in Maren Chan's live journal.
704638	707720	I was saying I've never in my life eaten at Red Lobster.
708220	708420	Ever.
708741	709601	Red Lobster's good.
710141	711642	I know, but I've never eaten there.
711902	713443	How do you know it's good if you've never eaten there?
713703	716165	Well, because everybody tells me it's good and I believe my friends usually.
716185	717145	Do you believe everything everyone tells you?
717386	717626	Yes.
721195	723977	You know, Rob, I have some Swampland I could sell you in Arizona.
724597	724858	What?
724878	726299	You have what?
726319	728180	I have some Swampland I could sell you in Arizona.
728220	728500	Really?
728900	729481	Is it by the beach?
730281	730521	Yeah.
730842	731262	Oh, cool.
732623	736766	Anyway... They have white papers and they're super stupid.
736786	739928	Of course the chat room is going, Of course Rob doesn't eat fish.
739968	740668	He's a fag.
740708	741589	Ha ha ha ha.
741889	742630	Yeah, really funny.
744315	745957	Zero has brought over his sex box.
746297	746838	And with that comes...
764107	767589	DDR Ultramix, which I have not seen at all yet.
768329	771891	And I think a lot of people here haven't really seen this at all yet.
772352	774273	So we're getting to see this for the first time.
774293	776334	Now, a few things first.
776594	779175	A, the wrong cables were brought over.
779255	783318	So we're looking at this game in black and white right now because we're trying to hook... It's overwhelmingly green.
784218	784498	Good.
784558	785459	It's blue, isn't it?
787658	788599	I had heard it was really blue.
788639	789499	Anyway, a few things first.
789780	795885	Component cables were brought over, so A, we can't hook it up to any webcam or anything, so you're just going to have to kind of listen to us.
796306	803832	B, we're looking at it in black and white because we're plugging component cables into a RCA system.
804753	804973	Yeah.
806304	811388	Basically, the way that the screen looks, it's kind of built up as if you're looking at a concert stage.
812009	820676	It's got like a whole little set of Rattray type things on the side, and on the opening screen it has like spotlights on the top, and it's mostly really bright white.
821116	824118	And out of all of those EDR games, it has the coolest menu music.
825359	826480	Yeah, I agree.
826520	831925	So far, just with the menus and everything, I've been incredibly impressed, so... Yeah, I'm sorry, Jamie?
833186	834507	It sort of sounds like porn music, though.
835919	836459	Yeah, it does.
836479	837120	I'm kind of surprised.
837180	843464	Okay, I want to see... I have heard that Do That Fang has a really scandalous gay video to it.
843484	843985	Yeah, you know.
844025	844685	I want to see it.
844725	846927	We figured that you would like this video when you're at my house.
847027	849969	I must see Do That Fang, so if we could play Do That Fang, please.
850729	851069	Alright.
852270	853491	And then you guys can hear this, too.
854732	855653	It's a funny song.
857334	858354	I think we're okay.
858394	858735	I'll just...
862218	863418	Probably better watch the video.
863959	870040	Oh, yeah!
870480	872501	Okay, there's like, wow.
876382	878662	This is the gayest video I've ever seen in my life.
878702	883444	There's like women in fur and half-naked men.
909636	913859	These two chicks are standing in front of a microphone that says the name of their band, Masai.
915140	916661	It's very Britney Spears to me.
916681	918182	They look like Britney Spears clones.
918202	919323	I guess it's two girls.
931251	931991	Oh my god!
932011	933172	They're not wearing pants!
933472	934153	That's awesome!
937915	939697	Goddammit, why can't this be in colors?
939717	947307	Their undies are wide anyway.
952454	954737	My god, I might just have to buy an Xbox for this.
960124	961666	I know the next song you gotta play though.
961747	962568	That was great.
963169	964590	Okay, what's the next song we gotta hear?
964610	966293	Ready Steady Go by Paul Oakenfold.
966333	968115	Ready Steady Go by Paul Oakenfold.
968235	969377	It's an awesome song.
970418	972761	Okay, let's hear Ready Steady Go by Paul Oakenfold.
973883	974504	How did Loki do?
974544	976747	Loki got an A on Do That Thing by Masai.
986280	989483	Yeah, this is a really cool one, and the steps will kind of trip you up halfway through it.
989543	990083	It's really cool.
998990	1001111	Oh, it has a lot of steps really close to 3-Days.
1012529	1013490	All like three minutes?
1014310	1014731	Oh no.
1015211	1016252	So edited for length.
1016352	1017793	Oh yeah, I thought you meant like did I edit?
1017813	1018793	No, this is the full thing.
1019434	1021395	But they got all the elements of the song.
1023777	1024457	Like perfect.
1027019	1034164	And what I'm really impressed of is the fact that almost all the songs, like the license... Oh my god, a slowdown!
1034705	1037307	They all have really good steps.
1038427	1038768	Really?
1039268	1041610	Except for shiny disco balls.
1042642	1043842	God, I love that song, though.
1045263	1046664	It's just so repetitive.
1046704	1048924	Whoa, speed up!
1096258	1098560	Alright, that was Ready Steady Go by Paul Oakenfold.
1098600	1101503	We're playing DDR Ultramix here on Orange Lounge Radio.
1102444	1103846	No webcam tonight, guys.
1103906	1104927	Sorry.
1105087	1107749	We haven't been able to get it working again since the computer upgrade.
1108850	1113635	And we can't hook Ultramix directly into our video card either because we don't have that either.
1117694	1122037	They also have a cool song that, of course, most people know it, Castles in the Sky.
1122497	1124399	Yeah, Castles in the Sky, most people know that song already.
1124639	1126600	They did a really good job with the steps of that too.
1126840	1127181	That's cool.
1127381	1128562	Let's hear one of the remixes.
1128822	1132264	I'd like to play one of the new remixes for everybody.
1132284	1134145	The two remixes that are on here right now.
1134366	1135606	What are the unlocks so far?
1135827	1143312	The unlocks that I've done so far are the Metal Gear Solid song from Beatmania.
1144392	1155005	Oh, this is Keep Your Body Movin' by Thuggy D. The cool thing about this Thuggy D guy is the fact that he remixed Absolute and Insertion.
1155285	1160231	I think most people are pretty convinced that this is just Scotty D from Drop the Bomb.
1160251	1161313	It's actually not.
1162054	1162354	Really?
1162434	1162654	Yeah.
1166593	1172935	they have a link on the internet to where you can go and get his group information this is very interesting
1197031	1200133	I haven't heard a DDR song about DDR in a long time.
1201974	1205476	Really, I thought this was probably the worst song on the whole night.
1205776	1210959	Yeah, this is definitely like an old Dippy Mania song.
1211019	1213121	It's interesting, I'll give it that.
1221363	1222784	Yeah, Ballad For You is in this.
1222924	1235388	I also unlocked one of the Infinite Prayers.
1236268	1237449	Oh, cool.
1237629	1241270	Somebody had told me that Santa Malete, the BLT style, is in Unlock, actually.
1241630	1243050	No, it's just already in there.
1243131	1244511	It's out of the box.
1244611	1247252	Oh, the remix Santa Malete, the new one.
1247292	1248132	I haven't heard that yet.
1248152	1249953	Well, it's not new if you play 4-style, but...
1251118	1251938	Yeah, I haven't heard that.
1252359	1255360	That's a pretty neat looking background, considering we were looking at it in black and white.
1257141	1258522	The videos are generally pretty good.
1258542	1258982	Very interesting.
1260863	1263085	Alright, maybe one more, for now.
1264125	1266106	Yeah, let's play the two remixes real quick.
1266166	1266466	Alright.
1271029	1272770	Now the quickening, too.
1273150	1275171	Wait, we'll play a little clip of There For You, we'll just play the clip.
1275191	1276092	This is There For You by WD.
1282236	1284258	All right, so this is Absolute.
1285759	1288961	This is a remix of Absolute by Thuggy D. What is this called?
1289362	1291263	This is called Cut and Stuff It Mix.
1291283	1292124	Cut and Stuff It, yeah.
1292164	1292885	Cut and Stuff Mix.
1293025	1293845	All right, let's hear it.
1296728	1306215	And there's the Machine Gun Kelly version insertion once again done by Thuggy D. Well, we'll see.
1306295	1307756	It gets better in the middle.
1307776	1309538	Okay, we're going to listen to Absolute Cut and Stuff Mix.
1397068	1398770	Wow, it sounds like a hoedown all of a sudden.
1403276	1404558	What the hell was that?
1405139	1406240	Somebody banging on the piano.
1408022	1409004	Um, kinda lame.
1409104	1409645	I didn't like that.
1410506	1411026	I didn't like that.
1411960	1413381	Chatroom doesn't seem to care for it much either.
1413621	1414942	That was disasterific.
1415103	1416023	Yeah.
1416063	1417785	Chatroom would like to hear the insertion mix.
1417805	1419766	It sounds like there's a lot of them that like that little clip.
1420607	1423930	Alright, we'll play that and then we're going to do some other show and then we'll come back to this later.
1424170	1431596	Yeah, basically the Absolute sound like a crappy ass happy hardcore slash Disneyland electrical parade.
1432336	1432877	Interesting.
1435934	1437840	God damn it, now I'm going to have to buy a fucking Xbox.
1437880	1439103	No, you'll like the insertion one.
1439264	1439765	Alright, here we go.
1440387	1441670	Machine Gun Kelly mix of insertion.
1504768	1507686	Here's your typical slowdown that you're used to in the normal insertion.
1542196	1544916	Alright, that was insertion of the machine gun, Cali makes no speedup at the end.
1545362	1548843	No, and, no, yeah, it was still cool, I like the way that they did it.
1548983	1551384	I like how someone in the chat room put it, it sounds like a Loki remix.
1551724	1554345	It kinda does, actually.
1554385	1554965	It really does.
1556285	1561287	I mean, Buggy D all around did a good job, except for Absolute.
1562627	1566768	And I mean, I just wonder if they do make another one for the Xbox, if they do.
1566788	1571990	From what I understand, this is just more of a promise kept to bring one to it.
1573791	1574031	What?
1576028	1577870	Oh, yeah, it's one from Dance Maniacs.
1578150	1584074	Yeah, I mean, if they do, for the fact, make a new one, I wonder if he's gonna be back doing more stuff.
1584354	1588557	If he's gonna turn into, you know, Scotty D or... We'll see.
1588837	1592420	Alright, let's, uh, pull the plug on Ultramix for now.
1593921	1595883	God, no, turn off the love to me, Jesus.
1597244	1597524	Alright.
1598976	1600419	Yeah, we'll play that one.
1601200	1604727	Maybe later in the show we'll get to the Metal Gear one and the shiny disco balls.
1604807	1605929	Some people want to hear that too.
1607668	1614033	Anyway, Ryan, you've been playing this more than anybody else here, really.
1614733	1616654	Being a DDR fan, what did you think of Ultramix?
1617295	1619396	And compare it to Max 2 for PlayStation 2.
1619596	1625401	Well, I mean, you can kind of compare it as out of the box that Max 2 would be better.
1626061	1629083	But a lot of the redeeming qualities, too...
1632646	1640133	The Xbox One is the fact that out of the box it's got a couple good remixes and it has a couple new songs that you haven't heard.
1640673	1648480	And on top of that, it's more of a party game now for the fact that you can have four people playing in your house at the same time.
1650682	1655306	Which we actually tested around a little bit last night and it's pretty fun because it gets pretty competitive.
1656341	1664103	Um, on top of that, of course you have the Xbox Live stuff where you can get on there and play up to four people at once.
1665723	1670604	Um, transferring edits back and forth and stuff like that.
1671404	1674425	I managed to play against one guy with an edit he had.
1674925	1679006	And seriously, a lot of these people who made edits are really, really bad.
1679226	1681907	It almost makes a lot of the Tournament 4 stuff look good.
1681927	1683867	I mean, it's that sad.
1684326	1687189	About the Xbox Live, though, can you talk to them while you're playing?
1687449	1695095	Yeah, when you buy an Xbox Live with the DDR pad, if you look in the front of the DDR pad, it has a part where you can hook your communicator in, and they give you like a stick.
1695175	1696016	Oh, so it's hooked to the pad?
1696256	1698138	Yeah, and you can put a memory card in there, too.
1698158	1698898	Oh.
1698938	1704063	And the cool thing is they give you a six-foot extension for your headset, because, you know, it only goes down about three feet.
1704143	1704383	Yeah.
1704583	1707225	You can get a longer extension for it so you can talk while you're dancing.
1707245	1708847	It goes into the controller port.
1709235	1709395	Yeah.
1710255	1716137	And another good thing, too, that I was really impressed with was the actual pad that comes with it if you buy it.
1716598	1720899	It's, I mean, I know a lot of people say, oh, we have really good anti-slip stuff.
1721359	1728402	That pad on the Xbox, I got a running start about 10 feet away, jumped up on it, and it didn't move anywhere.
1728902	1733423	I was able to play stuff like Suguru really, really well, double ate it.
1734104	1734664	So, I mean, there's...
1735544	1739525	No problem with the pad, it's all a really, really good thing all around.
1739585	1744907	And plus, the online stuff, you're going to be able to download new characters, you're going to be able to download new songs.
1745447	1758712	And if they keep going at the rate they are with the new songs they've released onto the game itself, and they have those really good steps like that, with the exception of a couple, it's going to prove to be a very good game.
1759332	1773283	One of my buddies had said he was playing the DDR Xbox online, he was playing through Xbox Live, and he was playing some guy and challenging him, and then at the end he beat this guy, and he heard over the microphone, like he heard a kind of distance, man, this guy just beat me!
1774084	1778047	Yeah, he says this Xbox Live thing really makes DDR fun.
1778547	1795964	Well, here's the thing, too, is the fact that if you don't want to go out and spend money at the arcades all the time, and you just want to have a small little DDR at home to play against other people, that's a great way to go, for the fact that you still have your own screen, and, you know, the other person has their own screen, so you're not sharing the screen.
1796605	1800129	It's a lot of fun, and to hear some of that chatter online is really funny.
1800669	1802371	Except for the delay, like...
1802984	1806465	Actually, it's not that bad, because the songs load up on their own.
1806545	1808105	For one, the chat delay.
1808505	1812626	Because I know when I was playing PSO for a while, you'd get maybe five seconds in between.
1812686	1814527	Yeah, it happens occasionally.
1815467	1830050	But the one thing I like is the fact that both songs don't have to be running totally consecutively, because the Xbox will load it, and it just throws up your... The only thing that it really transmits back and forth is your score, as you play against the other person on the same song.
1830424	1832346	Have you tried buying the new songs yet?
1832426	1835608	I hear that you can buy five new songs for five bucks right now on Xbox Live.
1835628	1836329	Yeah, you can.
1836449	1842334	I actually haven't had a chance to do it yet because my Cat5 cable is not long enough to reach my Xboxes, so I've got to do it somewhere.
1842474	1843855	I might do it tonight before I leave here.
1844555	1845156	Oh.
1846137	1848559	Or maybe I can do it by the end of the show since we have a spare cable.
1848599	1849139	That would be interesting.
1849159	1850360	Yeah, actually, we have a spare cable.
1850400	1851401	Maybe we could buy the songs.
1852482	1854183	I can do it with no problem.
1854223	1855244	I have it all set up to do it.
1855344	1855684	All right.
1856225	1857025	So we'll see what comes out.
1857125	1858947	I don't know if they're selling characters yet, though.
1859127	1860008	I don't think they're selling characters.
1860028	1862230	I've only heard that they have the five songs so far for sale.
1862770	1864672	Um, but there are a couple new songs.
1864692	1865152	Do you remember?
1866153	1868355	There was, uh, wasn't Love Will?
1868415	1869176	No, there was some...
1870709	1875453	In My Eyes is in it, and, um, crap, I can't remember the other one.
1875473	1875913	Mine Parasite.
1876173	1881457	Mine Parasite, and then there was, like, Burning Heat, um, Burn on the Floor, and, like, some other thing.
1881477	1887041	I heard from what they're gonna try to do is throw as much Extreme stuff in it as possible, as Konami of Japan will allow you.
1887081	1889423	Well, Colors for Extreme is in here, it's an unlock.
1889463	1890504	Yeah, I know that.
1890664	1891644	I've heard, I've heard that.
1891685	1896328	There's a couple I've heard, but I really wanna see how well they do it.
1898652	1902595	I'd also heard that Santa Muerte, the BLT style from Force Style is in there too.
1903155	1904576	That would be a fun unlock, I think.
1904817	1917166	The problem with the unlocks on here, and it's not even so much a problem, it's like, after you play one song, which anyone who plays this probably won't mind knowing, the Metal Gear song from Beatmania, it's the first song you unlock.
1918407	1926794	You unlock Santa, if I remember correctly, by, I think, double-a-ing or passing Santa on all difficulties.
1927295	1927535	Really?
1927855	1927995	Yeah.
1928015	1928976	I'll have to try that.
1929757	1931078	I also know that there's some...
1933279	1936361	There is supposedly an unlock everything code, like how 2DX had.
1937001	1940764	If you got 573 or something like that, it would unlock everything.
1943525	1948768	There's supposedly something like that on the Xbox, though I'm not sure exactly how they plan on having it done.
1951560	1954202	I wouldn't say Ultramix is better than the Extreme Japanese yet.
1955023	1957525	Because it doesn't have as many songs.
1957925	1961408	Out of the box, it's got like 38 songs.
1961448	1963010	And you can only unlock like 9 more.
1963750	1966112	Which, that's the real assy part about it.
1966633	1968494	You know what though?
1968594	1970376	It's all credit for Ultramix.
1970696	1972858	It's great because it's like new.
1972978	1975020	They've made old stuff look really new.
1975560	1976641	Like, you know, they've kind of...
1977722	1981005	Redone the interface, and like Loki said, the stage select music is awesome.
1981025	1984908	They have some innovative new modes with the whole live play and the four player thing.
1985389	1987370	They've really taken steps in the right direction.
1987411	1990653	I've got to totally credit Konami of Hawaii making an interesting DDR mix.
1991474	1998220	Supposedly also there's a mode with the arrows where if you step on a certain arrow it gives more life to your life bar or something like that too.
1998260	2000902	Yeah, it's supposedly one of the unlockable modes.
2001102	2002584	There's supposed to be two new unlockable modes.
2003084	2004185	I just don't know about it yet.
2005546	2010710	But yeah, I mean, this mix all together is shaping up to be really good if they keep up on those downloads.
2011350	2028944	I mean, it's really cool if they do have five new songs, but what I don't want to see is they go, you know, maybe a few weeks, because it's supposed to be like every two weeks I think they're going to do that, or once a month, and what'll be stupid is if they drop it after two months and they never do it, because I don't think they will for the fact they can make the money.
2029795	2033116	But, you know, it's happened with stuff like that before.
2033656	2034756	Let's see, the unlockables.
2034856	2041118	They've got, of course, the Metal Gear Solid 2 Mission R by LED from Beatmania.
2041718	2044538	To unlock that, you get any grade of an A on any song.
2045078	2047979	Gradient 6 Cyber by Taka.
2048379	2049099	That's another unlock.
2049239	2050080	Double A any song.
2050480	2052200	Put Your Faith in Me Saturday Night Mix.
2052580	2053420	Quit a song.
2054381	2055701	I quit it because my phone rang.
2056421	2057822	and Paranoia Rebirth.
2058262	2061763	Get a C or higher for Paranoia Eternal on all three difficulties.
2063264	2064204	Colors for Extreme.
2064604	2065844	Play a lot of songs.
2067545	2068805	It starts getting like that.
2069726	2071126	Healing Vision and Angelic Mix.
2071206	2074087	Get a C or higher for Healing Vision on all three difficulties.
2074528	2075908	Santa Mor... whatever.
2076268	2077929	The BLT style for Santa is...
2078809	2084374	Gasee or higher for any Santa song, or for Santa on all three difficulties.
2084855	2093062	Max 300, AAA any song or pass it on Roulette, and Orion 78 Civilization Mix Beat Challenge Mode.
2094063	2094964	Those are all the unlocks.
2094984	2098387	I mean, that's good unlock stuff, though, right there.
2099027	2101550	I'm just curious to see what they're going to sell.
2103311	2104873	If they sell any of the other Maxes or anything.
2106010	2111734	I still don't like the idea of unlocking old songs, but since this is Xbox's first mix, we'll let it slide.
2111894	2114735	And the fact that there is some really good stuff that you do unlock in there.
2114955	2118958	There's the one concern, though, is how people are going to cheat the system.
2121446	2125972	and the only... I think that people are going to find a way to do it, though.
2126532	2127113	To copy them.
2127934	2129275	Not that I would encourage it, you know.
2129396	2131678	I would expect for people to... To copy the downloads?
2132019	2133641	Well, yeah.
2133841	2137025	Like what we do for Phantasy Star with the Game Shark.
2137866	2138546	And a laptop.
2138626	2139087	That's all you need.
2143522	2152788	But, you know, I'd just like to encourage, you know, for anyone who's listening who has the game or plans on getting it for the Xbox, go ahead and buy your downloads.
2153568	2156030	Don't, you know, don't try to cheat the system.
2156991	2157411	In this case.
2160069	2163170	Yeah, because then they'll make new DDRs and blah blah blah, everybody's happy.
2163410	2173334	I mean, for the symbol case, I mean, you bought, I mean, if you're buying Xbox, if you're buying the Xbox version, obviously you're buying it so you can play online and so you can download new songs.
2173914	2184158	You know, if you're gonna sit there and steal the songs, then what's gonna end up happening is they're gonna be like, oh, well, we're not making enough profit off this game, so there's absolutely no reason for us to make another game.
2184258	2186659	Then DDR will be dead and it'll be all your fault!
2187259	2190922	Yeah, I mean, this is a really cool game.
2191022	2195106	And if you make it so another one's not going to come out, I'm going to come out and personally kick your ass.
2195926	2196827	You know what I'm hoping?
2197888	2204353	I'm thinking, this may be a way out here statement that I'm going to get my butt kicked for.
2205975	2208096	Way out there statement I'm going to get my butt kicked for.
2208176	2215843	But maybe if DDR is successful enough on the Xbox, Microsoft will have the balls to tell them to bring 2DX over here.
2217042	2217943	Pray, pray, hope, hope
2243579	2249882	Rumor is, now take this with grain of salt, rumor is apparently this was published in some Konami newsletter in Japan this week.
2250462	2252443	Seven styles on its way, 80 songs.
2253383	2253963	So we'll see.
2254223	2254543	Happy.
2254763	2258385	We don't know any details yet, but we will keep our eyes posted.
2258805	2263507	Well, you know what I was thinking that could be possible for them to do, especially on Xbox?
2264147	2264807	Keyboard mania.
2265628	2268329	There is a US keyboard mania release for PC.
2270530	2278301	I remember we talked about it on one show here and information was scarce as it is so it was a really under-promoted thing.
2278700	2279401	I mean, just think about it.
2279481	2282263	If it's on the PC, it can go on the Xbox, no problem.
2282483	2282723	Right.
2283464	2288427	So, perhaps they might decide to try that one.
2288487	2296373	It'd be the way Keyboard Mania was, a very small market, but bring it out, put enough of a price tag on it, and they'll make their money back.
2296413	2301377	I know, if there was enough interest to keep that PC one alive when we barely know anything about it,
2302117	2305498	and, you know, some people actually consider our station a source of news.
2305698	2305999	Shock.
2306999	2308059	We barely know anything about it.
2308099	2311141	I don't know how this Keyboard Mania thing is making its money on PC.
2311801	2319004	One last thing about the Ultra Mix that's kind of cool is if you have a metal pad for the PlayStation 2,
2320465	2332775	You can go to Fry's or whatever your main heavy hitter electronics store is and buy a little $20 adapter and you can use it on the Xbox because it actually does work because it's mapped out to the buttons.
2333596	2342884	So you can actually use your metal pads or even if you don't want to spend the money on a new Microsoft pad and you have PlayStation 1s laying all around, spend $21.74 and go and buy an adapter.
2348157	2349919	And you can play all your games.
2350859	2358646	And it's really worth it for the fact that, I mean, some people also don't like the Xbox controller for pretty much anything, or fighting games and stuff.
2359127	2360928	You can always use the PlayStation controller, too.
2360988	2361609	It's worth using.
2364452	2364792	Okay.
2364812	2369436	You guys want to take a break, or you want to just go into some how was your week, how was your day?
2369456	2371518	Because I know we've got a lot to talk about here.
2372782	2379684	Alright, well, Jamie, you were gone for some time here Two whole weeks Two whole weeks, that's a long time, you know
2380765	2381705	Well, how was your month?
2381745	2382506	How was your day?
2383686	2388628	Well, Mara and Sean went with me to Alabama.
2389228	2390309	We stayed at my grandmother's place.
2390849	2403734	Basically, it was a lot of running around in my grandma's car and finding people and seeing old friends and visiting and doing some gaming, which made me happy because I haven't done any gaming since the last time I was in Alabama.
2404874	2410076	I got to see a lot of people I really missed.
2410176	2411637	We watched so many movies while I was there.
2412877	2413738	Finally saw The Ring.
2414378	2414798	Finally.
2415598	2416919	Multiple times while I was there.
2418079	2421801	And then we rented Ringu and it was okay, but I like The Ring.
2423161	2428403	And then we saw Scary Movie 3 and Kill Bill again.
2429244	2431204	And the third Matrix movie, which was...
2435454	2442780	Um, which everything in that movie happened exactly how I expected it to except for the very end, which I'm not going to spoil for anybody.
2443640	2453107	Um, I'm not answering any questions on that.
2453668	2457731	Yeah, he turns into a bunny and scampers off into the sunset.
2458592	2458632	Um,
2460413	2465554	And you thought all those how far does the rabbit hole thing go was all just like, you know, metaphors.
2465994	2468374	Uh-uh.
2468494	2474676	He was going on a skateboard in a little, you know, vest with a pocket watch going, I'm late.
2476896	2480797	He was fighting Smith and then all of a sudden the wild stallions come in.
2482517	2487358	Yeah, all of a sudden Alex Winter shows up like, dude, we're in the wrong movie.
2490031	2490611	Kill me now.
2493073	2493433	Anyway.
2497957	2501840	You know, I really wanted to go to the French Quarter while I was there, but I didn't get to.
2502380	2509845	We just got into New Orleans, drove back, although we did eat at a really nice buffet at the Beaurevage in Biloxi.
2510846	2511607	And it was free.
2513708	2517251	And, let's see, I played DDR at Cyber Station.
2519058	2521040	The Dance Maniacs machine is gone and that made me cry.
2522481	2522782	Really?
2522922	2526785	Yeah, and the DDR machine there was kind of crap.
2528686	2535672	I twisted my knee playing on that machine, but then again I hadn't played any DDR for a month because of that nasty sinus infection I had.
2536993	2539516	I never got a chance to go find the Beatmania machine.
2539556	2540596	I found out where it is.
2541737	2542717	It was at the mall.
2542737	2543998	I used to work at it, Springdale Mall.
2544738	2546738	And they're renovating the mall.
2546758	2548339	They're rebuilding the whole center of it.
2548419	2555140	So they moved the machine, actually, to a little, I think it's like a network gaming place slash arcade.
2556600	2563962	But it's over, for anyone who lives in that area who might be listening to the show, it's on Moffett Road by University.
2564502	2566322	Just this little sort of hole-in-the-wall gaming place.
2566642	2567583	But I didn't get a chance to go.
2567843	2568823	I have an off-topic question.
2569083	2569163	Oh.
2569921	2571762	What is up with those networking gaming places?
2571782	2575484	I've seen them popping up everywhere lately, like here in Sacramento, where Orange Orange is based.
2575944	2579025	I've seen at least three brand new network gaming places in the area.
2579746	2581687	There was one that we passed on the way up here.
2582607	2583768	Are they really that popular?
2583828	2584728	I've never been to one in my life.
2584748	2586809	They're going to go the way of the dot-com business.
2587529	2588530	They're like QZAR to me.
2588610	2592552	I'm not talking bad about QZAR.
2592572	2597454	I'm just saying QZAR is everywhere for about a year, and then suddenly they all disappear like that.
2599861	2608623	That's because Kezar Corporate went under, and then all the places stopped, you know, they stopped making the things, and now you have to play with the guns that are already built.
2609744	2611184	Different reasons, same outcome.
2611484	2611924	Sorry, Jamie.
2612044	2613264	Um, yeah.
2614285	2619006	Um, anyway, uh, I have completely forgot where I was, thank you very much.
2619318	2622059	You were playing DDR in the Beatmania Machine.
2622079	2624100	Yeah, I never got to play the Beatmania Machine.
2626080	2628301	What I had been told was a sixth mix, and I wanted to play it.
2629642	2640665	I took my mom out to dinner for her birthday at the original Oyster House, which is like the best seafood place in the universe.
2642006	2645087	All the seafood that they cook there is all locally caught stuff.
2645567	2646247	This is really yummy.
2646527	2648728	Fresh catfish and... Wait, wait, wait, wait.
2649258	2649999	All kinds of food.
2650439	2651300	Better than Red Lobster?
2652061	2659129	Red Lobster, okay, Red Lobster's good, but nothing beats fish caught in the Gulf.
2659370	2667339	And I have to say this, you eat seafood out here, all the West Coast seafood, does not taste as good as seafood caught on the East Coast.
2667359	2668500	I'm sorry, it does not.
2670593	2673934	It has this sort of weird flavor to it.
2675235	2677096	Real seafood is in the south.
2679276	2684218	And I got to eat fried okra, which made me happy because nobody out here knows how to cook fried okra right?
2685239	2686899	Because they make it all slimy and icky.
2687820	2688640	I ate the Cracker Barrel.
2689340	2693802	It made me sick because I'm not used to country cooking anymore.
2696340	2698242	But it was pretty good.
2698462	2698962	I enjoyed it.
2699583	2701965	What else did I do?
2701985	2703767	We rented lots of movies, like I said.
2704267	2705628	I got to see Undercover Brother.
2705648	2707070	That was like the funniest movie ever.
2711113	2712395	Not really much else happened.
2712455	2713916	Oh yeah, we went to Walmart a lot.
2714857	2715918	Super Walmart.
2715958	2716959	There's two of them.
2717899	2719321	I was so happy because I loved Super Walmart.
2719341	2721283	Now I've heard that associated with the South before.
2722022	2724464	They're, well, they can't have Super Walmarts out here.
2724485	2726326	There's like one, and it's in, what, Chico.
2726647	2728429	Well, they're going to open a Super Walmart in Chico.
2728709	2732292	But Chico is, you know, just like most rural parts of the nation, so.
2732433	2734575	It's, well, Mobile's hardly rural.
2735115	2737718	I know, but, I don't know how to put it.
2737958	2738279	Forget it.
2738439	2742443	But, um, but then maybe it's this College Town thing, I don't know.
2743884	2744185	Maybe.
2744205	2745426	But, um, the, uh.
2747557	2749680	We went there like practically every night.
2750681	2753004	It's like, we're bored, let's go to Walmart.
2753965	2755047	It reminds me of college.
2756201	2759903	When I was going to school, it was Walmart or Bruno's, the grocery store to go get liquor.
2760263	2760884	But, I'm sorry.
2763425	2764686	I got my transcripts from school.
2765286	2766546	Yay, so I can go back to school.
2766847	2767847	Man, this pisses me off.
2767927	2769988	I ordered two copies of my transcripts.
2770028	2771229	You know, two sealed copies.
2771729	2775411	So if I go to one school and want to go to the other, I can have both of those copies.
2776672	2777672	They only sent me one of them.
2778273	2780754	So I have to call them and bitch and fuss and moan.
2781855	2782815	Complain, complain.
2783355	2783455	Um...
2784856	2786840	The flight back was bumpy.
2788542	2792769	We went through this torrent right before we got into New Orleans.
2793631	2795974	There was an accident and it was all kind of crappy.
2796615	2798979	But our flights left within five minutes of each other.
2800023	2805225	We had everything timed so well, you know, when our flights were leaving and everything.
2805486	2812669	The ride to Denver was bumpy, the flight to Sacramento was pretty smooth, and then I got in town and was like, hey, it's cold.
2813249	2816951	By the way, Mobile has the most bipolar weather ever.
2817958	2820199	It's like, I'm hot, I'm cold, I'm hot, I'm cold, I'm hot, I'm cold.
2820219	2821339	It's like menopause or something.
2821819	2825720	Anyway, it was really kind of warm.
2825760	2827081	Of course, it was humid the whole time.
2827981	2832923	But around Thursday-ish, it got really cold, like in the 50s or so.
2833363	2834103	It was coat weather.
2834243	2836144	And then Monday, hi, I'm hot.
2837084	2837204	It's 80.
2838104	2838965	Look, the sun's out.
2840365	2841685	And people drive really slow there.
2843386	2843546	And...
2846297	2854257	I came back feeling really happy That's the best place anyone can go for a vacation because it's relaxing
2855422	2857303	No one's going to rush you or anything.
2859084	2860165	People are polite.
2861126	2862146	California sucks.
2863227	2868330	I mean, there's more to do here, but I think the vast majority of people out here just suck.
2869271	2872593	I said vast majority, not everybody.
2873053	2878597	Of course the people that I associate with, that I consider my friends, are in the non-suck portion of the community.
2878757	2879417	Well, okay.
2880198	2881979	But most everybody else...
2883566	2885407	There's not as many polite people.
2886088	2894593	No one's going to smile at you when you walk down the road or nod their head high or hold a door for you or be considerate.
2894673	2896254	People are too much in a hurry.
2896514	2898135	I smile at other people when I've gotten a raise.
2898216	2900797	And they probably look at you like you just escaped from the asylum.
2900857	2902638	Like when I've gotten a raise at work or something.
2907261	2911064	You never see the difference until you've been away from it for so long.
2912558	2918722	That it was just, I don't know, it was sort of almost disappointing to come back.
2919242	2920123	Almost disappointing.
2920943	2924926	But I mean, this is of course where my home is and I couldn't imagine living anywhere else.
2926007	2932571	But still it was just, I found myself getting homesick right when I got off the plane so it was really weird.
2934156	2939621	And as for my day, I got back and decided to try the test server for Ragnarok.
2940341	2943004	So I'm on the Sakurai server, enjoying it.
2945105	2949189	I'm supposed to be finishing up the last chapter of my fanfic, but I've only barely started it.
2950610	2954513	And, you know, work was work.
2955194	2961960	One good thing, though, I realized once I counted everything up, I only worked six days this entire month.
2962864	2964344	But you get paid for it all, right?
2964564	2965225	Oh, hell yeah.
2965405	2965945	Right on.
2966345	2971566	Because we got two holidays this month, my vacation, and plus we get two days off for Thanksgiving.
2972946	2974187	So it works out cool for me.
2976727	2977067	Anything else?
2977127	2978028	I am glad to be back.
2978208	2978808	Don't get me wrong.
2978928	2979428	Welcome back.
2979648	2981368	I am glad to be back.
2981908	2984529	You didn't miss a lot on the show, just Loki singing.
2985769	2986089	Oh, good.
2989690	2990811	Anything else you want to share?
2991111	2991991	All right.
2992031	2992311	Loki.
2993635	2994075	How was your day?
2994115	2994516	How was your week?
2996076	2997677	Today was okay until the power went out.
2997777	3002660	Then I went down to Golfland to meet with Keith again to show him something that he wanted to see.
3003401	3006362	He wanted to see the iPack to see how big it was.
3006442	3008624	So I went down there to go see him and he wasn't there again.
3008744	3009124	Surprise.
3009704	3019850	So I ended up playing some Guitar Freaks and some 4th Plus and No Extreme and a little bit of F-Zero.
3022032	3031486	and earlier this week I was still set on my computer getting it all working fine I'm busy in the I'm kind of in the process of right now of
3033018	3039021	Getting my copies of certain programs that I don't own to put them on my computer.
3039221	3042843	So I was busy downloading my updated software and all that.
3043723	3046865	I got a few other games I need to try out.
3046885	3050567	I just got Simpsons Hit and Run, which looks pretty good.
3051007	3054389	And then Celebrity Deathmatch, which looks kind of fun.
3055169	3059151	And then Midnight Club 2 didn't work for me.
3059371	3060872	For some reason, the image...
3061172	3061673	I've been working on
3070484	3076366	A list of something for a secret something that I'll be doing later.
3077047	3079948	I can't really say right now because I just can't.
3080108	3081748	It's not close to completion yet.
3082429	3089411	But on this list right now there's a good over 600 things on this list.
3089591	3091912	So it's a long list that I need to work on.
3093573	3097855	Anyways, so I've been doing that and I was going to work on the webpage.
3099517	3101618	Orange Lounge, but I never got around to it.
3102138	3104099	And... Yeah.
3104459	3108761	And also... Yeah, I don't know.
3109081	3110741	My show's in limbo right now, too.
3111562	3114283	So... I don't know.
3114683	3115363	It's been like that.
3115503	3117184	Kind of like a whole week's been in limbo.
3118984	3119645	That's pretty much it.
3121545	3121825	Alright.
3122186	3124646	Yeah, more programming notes to come after the next break.
3124666	3128268	There's some important programming notes that we'll need to get out of the way and take care of.
3129249	3130329	Thank you for watching!
3152534	3167185	I went out to Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation over downtown, and it's the third year in a row I've gone, and there's some pretty funny shit this year, namely the ninjas was funny, and what else was there that was good?
3167705	3171048	Something about this giant stick figure that was a condom, that was pretty good.
3171468	3174991	Happy Tree Friends, as always, was a winner, but the best...
3175899	3178860	By far, here comes Dr. Tran.
3179680	3181120	Fucking hilarious.
3181881	3190783	If you want to visit www.beyondgrandpa.com and get all the information on, oh shit, it's Dr. Tran, it's great and would be well worth your visit.
3191183	3191803	So that was fun.
3192883	3196564	And then yesterday I hung out with Jamie for a while where we worked on a couple of the new promos you'll be hearing.
3197244	3200725	And got to see my buddy Eddie who's in from out of town.
3201565	3202766	Made some home movies.
3203086	3203406	Yeah.
3203886	3204407	DarkSakura.com
3226009	3235950	and my eyes started hurting which kind of sucked but I took Tylenol and it's better now and I'm hoping I didn't catch whatever LankyStyle had because he had an eye infection the other day but
3237139	3238540	I don't think it was Pink Eye though.
3238660	3241342	It was just something where the eyes were like really, really hurting.
3241422	3241763	I don't know.
3242283	3245225	But I think I'm okay because I took Tylenol and I feel better.
3245345	3247247	So maybe it was just psychological.
3247307	3247667	I don't know.
3249368	3252591	So that was pretty much my week and my day.
3254032	3259115	Anyway, Zero or Miko, you guys have anything you want to share about your week and your day?
3259135	3260636	We haven't heard from Miko much this show.
3261057	3263839	Does she have anything you want to share anything about your week and your day?
3267495	3272939	You talk into the microphone, you just say, hi people, and this is what's good and this is what sucks, or whatever.
3279383	3280143	Yes, it is on.
3280363	3280784	Yes.
3281644	3283345	If you don't talk, they'll make me sing.
3283565	3284586	Please, talk.
3284786	3285246	Sing!
3285307	3285647	Yes!
3285747	3286247	No!
3286287	3286567	Yes!
3286647	3287028	No!
3287788	3288989	Loki does not sing.
3289029	3292051	We bring that out on special occasions and rating stunts only.
3295873	3296734	What'd you do yesterday?
3297617	3298758	I can't remember.
3299299	3300620	Did you go to Golfland at all this week?
3302121	3303222	Yeah, Friday.
3303582	3306625	Did you play anything interesting while you were there?
3308686	3310208	DDR Extreme.
3311008	3311469	Right on.
3312950	3317454	What was the last big song you passed in DDR Extreme?
3318847	3320068	Ooh, Cartoon Heroes!
3320428	3320868	Right on!
3321368	3324150	But I already passed that, like, when it first came out.
3324530	3324630	Oh.
3325270	3326271	But we just did it again, though.
3326591	3332314	I mean, you see, I could pass Cartoon Heroes when it first came out, but then I didn't play DDR for a while, and I started getting... Who's Rice Princess?
3333354	3335155	Um, that is Rice Princess.
3336016	3336996	And she goes to RVGL, too.
3337577	3337697	Oh.
3338377	3338837	Hi.
3340398	3340738	Irene?
3342699	3343219	Oh, hi!
3346670	3349591	Mika looks like a poor deer in the headlights right now with a microphone in her hand.
3349611	3351031	She's like, they can hear me?
3351472	3351832	Can they?
3352552	3353032	Oh my god.
3353392	3354573	Hello, is this thing on?
3355733	3364996	You know what, I could pass Cartoon Heroes when DDR Extreme first came out too and then I didn't go for playing for a long time and I got fat and older and then I couldn't beat it, but I can beat it again.
3366076	3366517	Likewise.
3366737	3367857	Yes, but I'll go...
3371508	3377091	After I Beat It, which isn't a lot of fun, so I only do that at birthday parties now and special occasions.
3378772	3383094	So, that being said, anything else you'd like to share with our listeners, Mikael, for now?
3383575	3384395	About your week and your day?
3388697	3389598	What do you think of Ultramix?
3391335	3393216	Oh, I think it's cool.
3393776	3394417	It is pretty cool.
3394437	3399319	I just need a pad that needs to be slippery so I can do the moonwalk.
3399519	3400240	Do you have an Xbox?
3400940	3403481	No, but my dad was going to buy me one.
3404342	3405922	I wish my dad would buy me an Xbox.
3405982	3406423	No fair.
3406763	3410225	But my mom said no because she's a loser.
3411485	3412065	Well, no.
3413606	3414927	She just wants what's best for you.
3416368	3418010	Which means less games and more chores.
3418630	3419591	Oh, exactly.
3419611	3422214	I have three jobs, by the way.
3422894	3423755	Dang, what jobs?
3424416	3426437	I'm a caregiver downtown.
3426598	3426958	Okay.
3427679	3431002	And I work for 31 Baskin Robbins and Rancho.
3431282	3431582	Okay.
3432763	3434225	Is that the one that's at Dunkin' Donuts, too?
3436478	3437539	I guess not, forget it.
3438139	3441120	No, but we have the coffee dunk by Dunkin' Donuts.
3441160	3442040	Alright, good enough.
3444721	3446521	And what's the third one, if you wanted to share?
3446541	3452803	Um, and I work at my school.
3454284	3454644	Alright.
3457525	3458425	Hooray for school.
3459805	3462046	Yeah, that's why I like going to school, because I get paid.
3465089	3465809	All right, right on.
3467370	3469510	Okay, so let's hear from Zero.
3469550	3470591	We haven't heard from Zero yet.
3470651	3473191	How was your week and your day, Mr. Zero?
3473512	3473852	Bleh.
3474232	3475252	No, it was okay.
3475272	3478193	You have your lower lip sticking out like you're pouty about something.
3478573	3483395	I had to spend, like, every dime I had on my piece of shit fucking car.
3483915	3484035	Oh.
3484815	3494118	You know, I only paid $100 for that car, so I wouldn't feel so bad if I set it in a nice, happy roll and then jumped out and let it crash into a wall or incoming traffic.
3495058	3497440	It's... God, my door doesn't shut.
3498321	3499882	So I had to tie it with a shoestring.
3503506	3505607	You're telling me it's ghetto.
3505728	3506748	I know my car's ghetto.
3506789	3511212	Nah, it's something easy to fix, it's just I don't have the 50 bucks for the stuff I need to fix it.
3512273	3521842	Um, I'm kinda pissed off for the fact that it says that the song pack 1 for Ultramix is released and yet they won't update their fucking sites.
3522442	3523423	to tell you what's out.
3523924	3526627	There's a lot of stuff that Xbox Live is screwing up on right now.
3526647	3530011	Somebody had showed me a site that had the X... I thought it was an Xbox site.
3530031	3533735	No, I know it tells... No, it's not... I'll tell you right now it's not Xbox because I'm on it.
3533755	3534055	Oh, okay.
3534095	3535857	They're just totally making it look like crap.
3536137	3536998	They're still stuck in...
3538630	3540350	I think you need an Ultramix party.
3562463	3563424	I was thinking about it.
3563584	3567886	I just gotta figure out how to plan it and when to... I mean, I know how to plan it, I just don't know when.
3568347	3569607	I think I need to finish my cabinet.
3570608	3570868	Yeah?
3570888	3573049	Yeah.
3573389	3577372	I got these two, like, wonderful DDR pads not being used at all.
3577392	3578833	They're just kinda sitting there.
3578973	3580153	Dude, you have your coin door.
3580294	3581114	That is hella cool.
3581714	3583716	I have everything, and that's why I'm broke.
3584876	3587778	We're gonna install the coin door into the laundry machine for the meantime.
3587858	3589039	I like that idea.
3592846	3593908	It's a lot of people.
3594148	3597031	It's just a joke.
3597351	3601256	And she cooked us dinner tonight, so do laundry here all you want.
3601376	3603238	Bring fish and you can...
3604437	3606138	Now I know why we couldn't download anything.
3606638	3610440	I'm looking at their service status, and it says that it's down.
3610820	3611421	Oh, that sucks.
3611681	3614822	And I bet you if I go back to it, it'll say that it's up, and then it'll say it's down.
3615563	3620685	But, um, no, yeah, I want to get everybody together, just to come over and have another B-Money party, because I miss it.
3620845	3623607	But money parties are fun, and I'm sorry I missed your last one.
3623807	3626508	I, um, I think I just was having my period.
3626528	3627069	You didn't miss much.
3627169	3628629	The only person who was there was Garrett.
3630680	3635622	Well, Garrett's cool, I know, I know, there's nothing to say he's a bad person, but hardly anybody showed up.
3635802	3637803	It was kind of, yeah.
3638223	3642045	But, um, oh, and my friend Alex from my work came, too.
3642565	3646927	But, um, yeah, I want to try to get something big and just have a bunch of fun.
3646967	3648948	We should do, like, a Christmas party or something.
3649808	3652970	and we could have a gift exchange, wouldn't that be fun?
3653650	3666476	you're the only one who finds that entertaining I think instead of a Christmas party we should have like a Hanukkah party because nobody ever has Hanukkah parties we should make up our own type of holiday everyone else is doing it everyone else is making up a holiday, why not?
3667256	3675560	or a winter solstice yeah, we need the Yule party where we like burn a log or we get the TV log
3678717	3679278	Great.
3680259	3680939	No, I don't know.
3681380	3686485	I want to get everybody together just because we haven't done it in a long time and every time we get together it's a lot of fun.
3690469	3690850	No idea.
3690910	3692792	We don't know a lot of these people in our chatroom, Miko.
3692812	3693432	They're just there.
3693652	3694874	They just start showing up.
3695134	3697637	They just started showing up and we haven't kicked them out yet, so...
3698823	3700184	There are our neighbors, your friends.
3700244	3701585	No, we love all our new chatters.
3701625	3702806	Hello to all the new chatters.
3703466	3707509	I've seen some new faces pop up this past couple weeks, so it's exciting.
3708090	3709010	And our old chatters, too.
3709151	3710411	Yeah, and Xbox Live's up now.
3710552	3711492	What are the odds of that one?
3712873	3713994	It's everywhere now.
3716076	3717577	We're not just... We're fucking big.
3717617	3718157	It's sad.
3718797	3720359	Anything else you want to share about your week and your day?
3721164	3723086	I managed to make it here today.
3723406	3724867	Congratulations, that is an accomplishment.
3724947	3728670	Honestly, throughout this Christmas season, I have no idea how many days I'm going to be here.
3729670	3732212	Because I work in the mall.
3732532	3732893	I mean...
3734150	3734530	Yeah.
3734930	3735911	It's alright, you know.
3736811	3740733	Well, the thing is that I'm trying to get coming back here every week.
3741173	3745115	Now that I have a car and stuff, kind of, that walks really fast but doesn't run.
3746876	3752659	Once I get this work schedule figured out, there'll be some nights hopefully I'll get here.
3752719	3755380	Either that or I'll just come here late, if anything.
3755840	3757361	Yeah, the mall closes at 6, right?
3757381	3759182	Yeah, the mall closes at 7.
3759262	3760263	Extended hours now.
3760403	3760703	Dope!
3761323	3765785	Yeah, so I mean, there's some people closing way late for no apparent reason.
3766585	3767085	So we'll see.
3767365	3769666	I'm still going to try to get here, and if not, I'll just get here late.
3770146	3771567	I've got to at least show up at some point.
3772807	3773887	They can't work you too hard.
3773927	3774768	There are labor laws.
3776608	3780330	Yes, but there's ways to get around labor laws.
3780470	3781450	It's very easy.
3782730	3783951	Anybody can lie these days.
3784851	3785912	You know who his boss is.
3785952	3787092	Yes, I know who his boss is.
3790169	3794952	And you think his boss would be sympathetic to the situation that there's this Orange Lounge radio program.
3795252	3798894	But no, that just makes him want to make him work more on Sunday nights.
3799414	3799755	Anyway.
3802476	3802716	What?
3802756	3803297	You heard what?
3804717	3805178	What'd you hear?
3805938	3808099	I heard that TDX is going to be at Sunsplash.
3808800	3817485	Eh, that's a rumor that always comes up, but we don't... I think they want to get it, but maybe the people that actually buy the games don't.
3818439	3818819	Oh man.
3819140	3819400	Okay.
3820121	3821602	They were going to get Derby Owner's Club.
3822223	3826346	That's before they found out it was going to be $60,000 for a four-player cabinet.
3826767	3830570	And they said, fuck it, because it's been out for a while and it's not making the money it used to.
3831331	3834174	And it would take over a year to make the money back on it.
3834774	3835515	So they said, fuck it.
3835555	3839438	But they do have $120,000 to spend on arcade games for this coming year.
3840737	3842538	So, it's a possibility.
3843338	3851620	I honestly don't want it there, because I think it'll get fucked up the same way that, you know, the one that Scandia does.
3851820	3862924	And I'd rather them, like, upgrade their Complete Mix 2 to a Beat Me in the Final, or even, like, I don't know if it's possible, upgrade Machine 2 to a Beat Me in the Final, or something like that.
3863644	3870948	But I'd rather them do that because at least it gets some play out of it and clean up the machine a bit and replace the coin door on it and stuff.
3876271	3876611	What else?
3876851	3881573	Oh, they were... Well, they're supposed to get another DDR machine there.
3883414	3883895	I can't say.
3884675	3888477	But there's possibly a new DDR machine coming in there.
3888637	3889397	It's touring.
3889457	3890458	It's from another golf land.
3892352	3900714	Yeah, one, uh, speaking of arcades, let's bring up hell and talk about Scandia.
3901855	3904915	Scandia, you thought Scandia was ghetto before.
3905656	3909116	You look at the Xtreme machine, it has no top.
3910357	3913838	It's, uh, they totally ripped the whole thing off the top.
3914258	3916558	There's no speakers, there's no marquee, there's no lights.
3917059	3918559	There's, for Xtreme,
3919781	3921162	No, it gets even better.
3921903	3925225	They left the bass speakers on there because you can't really get rid of them.
3926687	3939437	It's like they went to Kmart and bought a $150 little mini stereo system because there's two really shitty speakers on top, like the detachable ones off of a boombox or something.
3939937	3942600	They're sitting up there, like, you can't hear it, of course.
3943180	3947704	I mean, who... It wouldn't even matter.
3949123	3950064	They don't care anymore.
3950704	3953085	I've actually heard them say they don't care anymore.
3953905	3960428	That was the, you know, the shift managers were saying that, and also the main guy there doesn't care.
3960588	3966350	They care more about that stupid fucking Hick shooter game than they care about anything else.
3966510	3969572	Because people have been blowing money in their left and right.
3969752	3973053	That's what we need to be teaching the people in the ghetto, to shoot white people.
3976596	3980099	I would love to take the camera over to Scandia and get a picture of that assy machine, though.
3980159	3983022	It's there, but hey, their 2DX machine works.
3983983	3984083	Wow.
3984103	3984824	And it's a miracle.
3985685	3987306	I've got some Scandia tokens I need to blow.
3987326	3989388	You know what, I think I want to actually call the owners.
3992931	3994713	I think I, you know... Have a ball.
3995074	3997296	I have all the stuff to hook a recorder up to my telephone.
3997316	3998437	Record the conversation and put it on air.
3998457	3998897	It'll be funny.
3999197	3999558	I'll do it.
4001676	4005100	Not if you said that you're recording at the beginning of the phone call.
4005300	4009144	That's why every time you call a customer service place, they say this call may be recorded.
4010064	4012407	Say you want to interview them for a local radio station.
4014309	4014629	I'll do it.
4015930	4018453	Why does your arcade suck so bad?
4019174	4020275	Yeah, nobody cares.
4020295	4020835	They're losing money.
4021976	4023378	They asked me that again.
4024022	4030785	The other day, the Shift Magic guy comes up, and this is the guy who's like, oh man, you should apply here because it seems like you really care about the games.
4030805	4031465	I'm like, no, thank you.
4032085	4035627	But he's like, why are all your friends not coming here anymore?
4035687	4037548	I said, look at your DDR machine.
4038108	4038708	He said, what?
4038868	4042210	He said, it looks like my computer on top of some speakers.
4042450	4043890	There's nothing on there.
4044330	4046912	He said, yeah, well, that's because the speakers didn't work.
4046972	4049713	I said, if the speakers didn't work, you don't have to take the whole top off.
4050493	4053076	and he's like, yo, there's some other legal issues coming up.
4053136	4053837	How about this?
4054118	4055700	Keith went to RVGL.
4055960	4057422	Well, no, it's not that.
4057482	4064530	They said legal issues came up, so I wonder if someone, you know, ragged on him about having their extreme or something like that.
4065615	4090173	Oh please, that would be the first case I've ever heard of anywhere where somebody said something like that Well for the fact that they said legal issues makes me wonder what it was They're retarded, they don't know what the hell they're talking about Some stupid baby fell off the machine and now they have a lawsuit My kid was climbing the machine, fell down and cracked his head open So you need to remove that so he doesn't climb Darwinism at work
4093533	4097717	The music coming from that machine is making my child gay.
4100580	4102181	You need to remove that machine.
4102282	4103643	It's making people gay.
4105485	4108288	Why do we have to listen to all this Jap music?
4108508	4111531	We live in the United States of America, not Japan.
4112272	4114254	Keep your music to your own country.
4114374	4114874	Thank you.
4116451	4138827	No, one funny thing last night, too, I was standing there playing 2DX, and I was playing Dancer, and I didn't have the effects on, because it sounds like absolute shit with the effector on, and this lady's all, that's too loud, they can't hear the music game, and I was like, oh, I'm sorry about that, when she wasn't looking, I hit the effector, which was on Surround 1, so it was just this loud, blaring, screeching noise the whole way through it, she started, like, crying about it, it was pretty funny.
4145396	4152580	Miko's just kind of sitting in the corner, and sometimes, like, she's kind of like, she'll just sit there, and then she'll point at something in the chat, and she'll go, I know her!
4152820	4153301	I know her!
4153741	4154141	I know her!
4154862	4155202	I know him!
4155642	4155942	I know him!
4156923	4160065	And then you try to give her the microphone so she can say hi to them, and she does nothing.
4160145	4161026	Immediately clams up.
4163007	4166729	For the record, I love the artichoke dip from the Hufflepuff bar.
4167750	4169491	Hufflepuff bar.
4169511	4170351	Hufflepuff bar.
4172190	4175072	Anyway, let's take a break because we've gone like an hour now without a break.
4175973	4176954	So I think we need to take a break.
4176974	4180316	When we come back, we're going to have... I want to do a cage match first.
4180356	4181157	We're going to do a cage match first?
4181357	4181577	Fine.
4181877	4182798	We'll do a cage match first.
4183098	4183999	We'll do FUs later.
4185019	4191704	Cage match when we come back from this break with more just cornucopia of Bimani music.
4191804	4192245	We'll be back.
4216269	4217030	Thanks for watching!
4514312	4523685	And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.
4524225	4528451	Um, Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.
4528491	4529452	Can we talk about that?
4529733	4531816	No subject will ever be taboo.
4532316	4535959	Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights.
4536480	4539002	Except, of course, the subject that was just under discussion.
4539522	4544866	Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?
4545407	4546748	I collect your fucking head.
4548670	4550171	Just like this fucker here.
4551252	4554935	Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?
4555215	4558578	The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!
4559519	4561180	Now, if any of you sons of bitches...
4562034	4563835	Got anything else to say?
4564175	4565937	Now's the fucking time!
4567117	4570920	Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.
4572261	4576824	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 70.
4577965	4578665	In progress.
4580947	4581807	How's everybody doing?
4583248	4587131	I'm getting pissy because I can't find the cage match pick I want for tonight on my computer.
4587151	4587611	Hold on.
4590538	4591539	It's been on the whole time.
4591559	4592980	No, it's okay because it's muted.
4593660	4596502	Dude, I can mute them here and then they don't go past my computer.
4599183	4599723	Well, what's up?
4600004	4600404	Hi, Rob.
4600644	4600944	Hi.
4601224	4601485	Rob.
4602145	4602405	Rob.
4602905	4603125	What?
4603226	4603446	Rob.
4603566	4603766	What?
4604066	4604326	Rob.
4604366	4604646	What?
4604907	4605847	Rob.
4605927	4606167	What?
4606327	4606568	Rob.
4606608	4606828	What?
4607448	4607668	Rob.
4607788	4608068	What?
4611150	4611671	I hate you.
4612771	4613352	Hey, Rob.
4613372	4613492	What?
4622063	4626227	So did you hear about last week's cage match?
4627007	4627888	Uh, yeah.
4627948	4629329	Yeah, because I didn't have a song for you.
4629369	4630710	We did a reverse cage match.
4631171	4635054	And we nominated four songs to be booted off the station forever.
4635434	4639477	And did you know that Loki chose as one of his songs to be banned from the station forever?
4639878	4640598	He picked Holic.
4641379	4641879	Bitch.
4644381	4646663	No, I would so overrule that.
4646883	4647184	I know.
4647264	4649686	I'd use my chickly veto power.
4650612	4651112	Your tits.
4653934	4654914	Where's the other ferret?
4655595	4664900	Anyway, yes, last week in the Orange Lounge Radio cage match, we had a reverse cage match, and Nancy and the Boys Complicated from Speed 10 was banned forever.
4665800	4666601	Are you okay with that?
4667321	4667661	Yeah.
4668021	4669322	Okay, making sure.
4669622	4670883	Would I have a problem with that?

4716451	4716771	Whatever.
4717111	4717491	Oh, I see.
4718452	4721654	Okay, so let's hear the first song you can vote for tonight.
4723195	4725837	I would say last week's winner, but it's actually two weeks ago's winner.
4727318	4732146	Battle Without an Honor or Humanity, the 88 Severed Limbs mix by the one and only Loki.
4733088	4733549	Enjoy!
4734030	4737596	You only get to hear a clip of it because it did win last week, so we'll start about halfway in.
4825908	4832756	Alright, that's the first song you can vote for tonight is Battle Without a Honor or Humanity, the 88 Severed Limbs mix.
4833817	4839544	And, um, so, um, you can vote for that one.
4840164	4842767	Or you can vote for this next one, which is Jamie's pick.
4843488	4844850	Hey, Stop Fighting About Par Par.
4846419	4848301	We're trying to do a show here, hello!
4848821	4850462	Jamie, what song did you pick for tonight's K-Dress?
4850502	4852263	I brought something by Utah Saints.
4852283	4853944	Yes, it's FIFA 2001, actually.
4854865	4858467	I think it was done for FIFA 2001, but it's something else and I couldn't find the title again.
4858587	4859508	So we'll just call it FIFA 2001.
4859688	4860048	Okay.
4860628	4862930	Alright, so this is Jamie's pick for tonight's K-Dress.
4863110	4865852	They say the title in the song, though, somewhere.
4866452	4866732	Okay.
4867493	4869014	Something Hyper Beat or something.
4869890	4872133	Alright, well any particular reason you're picking this song?
4872333	4875398	Because I like Utah Saints, and we've never had one, so I picked one.
4875818	4880024	Alright, here it is, second song you can vote for tonight, Jamie's pick, Utah Saints with FIFA 2001.
4880064	4880164	Enjoy!
5022822	5023483	Check it out!
5023503	5023683	Power!
5023803	5024023	Power!
5024043	5024904	Power to the people!
5024924	5026326	Power to the people and the beast!
5090436	5094818	Okay, that was Utah Saints with, what was the real name of that song, Loki?
5094858	5095699	Power to the Beats.
5095919	5097740	Oh, thank you, DarkSakura, Power to the Beats.
5097940	5101642	We were calling it FIFA 2001, because it was from the FIFA 2001 game.
5101662	5105804	Well, not from the game, it was like, for reference.
5107165	5109266	It was in the game, too.
5109886	5111467	Okay, so your thoughts, Jamie?
5112708	5114268	I like Utah Saints, it gets a 9.
5115169	5115389	Loki!
5119167	5125108	I actually really did enjoy that song, and I wish I would have heard it before now.
5125128	5127308	Because I think it was definitely a good song.
5127348	5128969	I would give it an 8 or 9.
5149915	5153077	I would ask Miko what she thinks because she's on the phone, so she loses.
5153617	5155938	Alright, so their song number two you can vote for tonight.
5157019	5160520	Utah Saints with Power to the... People?
5160640	5160961	Beats.
5161121	5161701	Power to Beats.
5161941	5164042	Power to People!
5165583	5165903	Alright.
5167644	5171786	The song I wanted to pick for tonight's cage match I couldn't find and that kind of pisses me off.
5173404	5174746	Well, it's okay.
5174906	5177808	I have this backup because I was going to do this song at some point eventually anyway.
5178349	5179970	I just didn't want to do it tonight, but I'll do it tonight.
5180711	5182092	Okay, what did you think of that song, Mika?
5182112	5182892	Here, catch.
5184113	5184974	Come in!
5187376	5187877	Hello.
5187897	5189838	Hey, Jonas, what's up?
5189858	5191560	Mika, what did you think of that song?
5197642	5198723	You thought it was, is it on?
5198803	5200804	Oh, yeah, hi, oh, sorry What did you think of the song?
5200824	5206467	I thought it was cool I think, I wasn't really listening And what did you think of it on a scale of 1 to 10?
5211009	5222375	Lower, lower, lower I don't know, can we listen to it again?
5222715	5223776	No, we can't listen to it again
5227609	5229790	I don't know, I've heard better.
5229851	5231051	It gets a duh, alright.
5231652	5232953	I give it a three.
5233713	5234313	I want a three.
5234534	5235514	Okay, three and a half.
5237455	5239477	She says it's good and then gives it a three.
5243559	5244300	Okay!
5244580	5247282	I think that vote doesn't count because she wasn't paying attention.
5247303	5248644	Well, none of our votes count.
5248684	5251086	It's up to the chatroom in the end, so fair enough.
5251286	5252387	Maybe it's for the best that way.
5253548	5259033	Anyway, my pick for tonight is from a new dance compilation out there.
5259333	5261896	It's Now Dance 2004 from Britain.
5262516	5266640	And this is Mel C, one of the Spice Girls, but that's okay.
5266660	5267841	It's the Spice Girl that can sing.
5268141	5268862	Baby Spice?
5268882	5269503	Sporty Spice.
5270510	5272452	The one with the bad teeth?
5290380	5306764	On a mission, yeah, yeah, yeah If you're with me, raise your hands, yeah, yeah, yeah Got no inhibitions, it's our decision We're gonna have a good time It's easier to let go Than giving to yourself tonight
5466215	5472670	Yeah, yeah, yeah, if you're with me raise your hand Yeah, yeah, yeah, got no inhibitions
5519032	5521734	Alright, that was Mel C with Yeah Yeah Yeah.
5523035	5523395	Jamie.
5523735	5524055	What?
5524716	5526497	Mel C, Yeah Yeah Yeah.
5527437	5533741	It was kind of repetitive and made me think of that Britney Spears song that's in Fifth Mix.
5534522	5537523	So, no offense, but it gets like a 6.8.
5538664	5539645	Alright, Loki.
5544027	5546109	You know, this just goes to show you...
5547333	5551014	You know, they can leave the Spice Girls, but they still suck.
5552334	5555315	I don't care if I turn to you, this is crap.
5556296	5557896	It gets a 3, because it's good.
5561837	5562597	It gets a 10.
5563418	5565258	Loki doesn't know what he's talking about, and LC's awesome.
5566518	5566878	Zero.
5567699	5569259	You chose this song, didn't you, Rob?
5569279	5569759	Of course.
5570680	5572820	That explains all of it.
5573600	5575461	Um, the song really, really sucks.
5576564	5580905	Probably the worst song I've ever heard next to... Peanut Butter Jelly Time?
5582785	5587246	So, I've got a whole arsenal of MP3s I can dig out for you, Zero.
5587826	5588466	I don't care.
5588706	5591307	It still sucks and it gets less than a zero.
5592807	5593587	It gets less than me.
5594088	5595648	No, that sucked.
5595748	5596628	I never want to hear it again.
5596748	5597648	It gets like a one.
5599209	5599529	That's it.
5600329	5601489	Alright, Miko?
5603870	5604370	It's good.
5604530	5605650	I give it a one.
5608151	5611374	Battle Without a Honor or Humanity 88 Severed Limb Mix
5638237	5645880	Alright, song number two you can vote for tonight is Utah Saints with FIFA 2001, the, what the hell is the name of it again?
5646080	5646920	Power to the Beats.
5647020	5648021	Power to the Beats, thank you.
5655604	5659125	And song number three you can vote for tonight is Mel C with Yeah Yeah Yeah.
5666376	5671178	All right, send those votes over private message now, now, now to Sky.
5671719	5672439	I'm in the chat room.
5672479	5673159	Hello, how are you?
5675000	5678382	Wait, Jamie, before you get to the picture thing, because we're not ready for a break yet.
5678462	5681323	I wanted to talk, because I know you wanted to talk about this earlier.
5682043	5683284	You picked up a new game this week.
5683304	5688766	You passed up Ultramix to get your Eurobee collection, but you did get a new game this week, right?
5688786	5690987	Final Fantasy X-2, not X. Final Fantasy X-2.
5692188	5694829	People, it's 10, not X. Run the numerals.
5695209	5695889	Say it with me.
5696389	5698949	Ten, two.
5699329	5699810	Everybody?
5700290	5700630	X2?
5701230	5700630	12?
5701790	5702650	Is it Final Fantasy 12?
5702970	5705051	To piss Jamie off, I'll be calling it X2 all night long.
5705331	5705371	X2.
5705411	5706551	So what did you think of X2?
5707731	5708071	I don't know.
5708111	5709071	That game doesn't exist.
5709412	5710592	What did you think of Final Fantasy 12?
5712212	5716153	You know, the posters for that game look pretty neat, and the main character's hot.
5717239	5719500	And actually, yes, they do have pictures of the game up on the internet now.
5719600	5723582	So what do you think about Final Fantasy, I mean, Charlie's Angels, the game?
5729225	5730646	That was just like... That was great.
5731942	5754831	I love the game, I'm having a great time with it, although my big disappointment came when they brought in my man, because in the Japanese version my favorite voice actor is his voice, the guy with one leg, and his voice is okay in the US one, but I'm getting a Japanese one coming up probably in a month or so, so I get to hear it later.
5757879	5758460	It's not bad.
5758540	5764525	The whole Albed thing is back, you know, where you pick up the primer and everything, but it doesn't really interfere with the game.
5765827	5766807	It's pretty neat so far.
5767308	5769630	I'm about, I think, up on the fourth, fifth mission.
5770471	5771191	I'm enjoying it.
5773013	5782362	Although, make sure that you have plenty of healing implements and as much magic refill things as you can right at the beginning of the game because it gets pretty tough.
5783999	5786640	But the whole Dressphere thing is pretty neat.
5787180	5793983	I'll probably pick it up and play through it because I played through 10 and I played through all the other ones and it's what I do.
5797124	5797705	But yeah.
5800766	5803367	Ah, Darkchild says that at E3 they called it X2.
5803427	5805188	They're idiots.
5807749	5808269	Just saying.
5813025	5816167	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, X is not actually how it is.
5816548	5817048	Thank you.
5817188	5818129	This isn't Mega Man.
5818169	5820430	They're just tailgating off the X-Men.
5821091	5821531	I don't know.
5821631	5825634	You see, because I really... I would find that person and shoot them in the head.
5826054	5826535	X this.
5826755	5829957	You know, I really liked Final Fantasy VIII.
5830357	5831318	It was really cool.
5831578	5833860	But this one's okay too, I guess.
5835801	5837222	I think everybody should get over it.
5837262	5838022	It's a game name.
5838543	5845368	But thanks to a link provided by... Who did I get that from?
5845408	5846409	From Nikari earlier.
5847770	5850432	We've got an MP3 of the English opening.
5850632	5853934	Yes, and I have to... We're going to need to skip forward just a little bit in the MP3.
5854014	5856015	Well, I'm going to have to unpack it first.
5856055	5857556	But we'll get to that after everybody's review.
5857576	5859978	We'll get to it after everybody's review because I have to unpack it first.
5860318	5860878	You know what?
5861338	5863980	They had another version of the intro.
5864020	5865941	They translated the intro.
5866141	5870624	The one that they were going to do, oh my God, they had the worst singer ever.
5871364	5873385	It sounded worse than the Best of Move 2 music.
5874906	5875667	No, no, no, no, no.
5877651	5884320	No, they actually had an English speaking person doing the intro, the last person, and it really sucked.
5884500	5892510	Kota Kumi was actually pretty good, her English one, but she put very odd pauses in it, and so it wouldn't have worked out.
5894672	5897595	Too many people would have just been really stupid over it and not liked it.
5898576	5900678	Even though her voice is absolutely awesome.
5900698	5902459	And I like her voice better than the one they got.
5903160	5908124	But the final person they settled with though has a really nice voice and did the song justice, I thought.
5909385	5914670	But it's still, you know, the same intro for everyone who's seen the Japanese intro.
5916552	5916692	So...
5918840	5925531	and probably pre-show next week I'm going to have the song Real Emotion on our pre-show.
5929000	5935503	Um, yeah, so I got to see a little bit of X-2 yesterday, and it's interesting.
5935683	5943206	I really liked how there's... I mean, this is to be expected when you have a direct sequel to a Final Fantasy game, but a lot of the same areas.
5943246	5946027	Like, you know, I was watching the beginning of the game, and there's a lot of Luka in it.
5946347	5951189	And so it was kind of cool to see the same areas, but with these new characters and different things.
5951209	5952509	I don't know, I'm easily amused, I guess.
5953650	5956651	But the gameplay overall, it looks like they kept the same...
5957618	5961667	engine for everything outside the battles and then totally redid the battle engine.
5962327	5963727	It's all active battle.
5963927	5964828	Yeah, it's all active battle now.
5964848	5965868	So you have to be really fast.
5965908	5966708	And they have the dress fears.
5966788	5970329	And that's the first thing I noticed was, my God, the battles are fast-paced.
5970549	5970949	Wow.
5971269	5972009	But it's pretty cool.
5972069	5972489	I like that.
5972509	5975470	I like the idea of some fast-paced battles in a Final Fantasy game.
5976150	5977010	The dress fears are fun.
5977050	5991053	But this is, yeah, between the dress fears and the whole just blatant Charlie's Angels theme going on with it, it is seriously, it's a cross between Final Fantasy and a Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen shopping game.
5991073	5991213	Wow.
5992053	5992533	No!
5993613	5994934	Do not insult the game like that.
5995014	6000735	And then, you know, you go to these tells, you're talking to people, it's like, you totally scored like 1,500 kills.
6000755	6004056	You open a chest that says, you scored Phoenix Down.
6004696	6004996	You know.
6005356	6008216	And everything is awesome this, awesome that.
6008957	6010737	Oh my god, you were so awesome.
6010937	6012377	You're going up a level, babe.
6013057	6015958	That particular scene where they're talking about the awesome sphere.
6016338	6017958	Girl, you know how to work that level.
6018639	6020459	It's just like that in the Japanese version.
6022192	6024133	You're so fired!
6027315	6028936	I did notice some changes.
6029877	6035320	In the Japanese version, there's the seagull team, and there's the gull wings in the US one.
6035380	6037221	That's like little changes here and there.
6039482	6040883	But they got all the same voice actors.
6041943	6042783	Yeah, that was pretty cool.
6042843	6047926	Don't get me wrong, just because I say it's a cross between a Mary Kay and Ashley Olsen game, I'm just, I'm poking fun at it.
6048326	6049946	It really does look like a pretty neat game.
6049986	6054869	I wish I could have, like, played it a little more, but I'm too consumed with Eleven to give a shit about any other Final Fantasy right now.
6055509	6056649	Um... Addict.
6057170	6059270	So... Ragnarok is cooler.
6059410	6060191	Ragnarok is cooler.
6060211	6064313	Yeah, and I need to beat Ten first anyway, so... Um...
6066092	6069017	Final Fantasy X-2, not too shabby.
6070079	6071481	It's kind of what you'd expect.
6071581	6077852	It's definitely kind of made for the fanboys, although, I don't know, I would say it's very J-game.
6081874	6084196	It's more for like teenage girls and gay men, but that's okay.
6085036	6088218	Fanboys will love it too because, you know, I guess they're hot or whatever.
6088238	6089439	It definitely gives the fan service.
6089639	6091380	Yeah, it's definitely for the fans.
6091821	6096584	And that's good because they need to sell a lot of copies to make up for how much money they lost on the movie.
6097144	6102047	Well, you know, I really, though, I really think that the different job changed just a little.
6102548	6108091	They have like set animations, like when you change into the singer role.
6110523	6115448	She has the spotlight on her and the lights behind her and it's dark, so it looks all dramatic.
6115488	6118951	Like when you change into the thief, she hops across the moon.
6119632	6121914	You know, there's a moon in the background and they hop across.
6122295	6128601	When you change into the sword fighter, you see their reflection in the sword.
6128961	6131844	And Yuna has Titus' sword.
6132704	6133385	That was really cool.
6133425	6134006	Yeah, that's pretty neat.
6135144	6136205	It's pretty cool.
6136706	6138607	It actually doesn't look like it ruins a whole lot.
6138647	6142590	I still haven't beaten Final Fantasy X and it hasn't really ruined a whole lot, really.
6142630	6151597	I mean, you can kind of pick up something that must happen, but I'm kind of appreciative that they didn't wreck the whole storyline to X with X-2, you know what I mean?
6153558	6154359	Does that make sense at all?
6154779	6155299	It makes sense.
6155559	6155860	Alright.
6158842	6159582	What did you think, Loki?
6159602	6160823	You got to see the game a little bit.
6161484	6162164	He's running away.
6162545	6164106	Have you gotten to play X-2 at all, Zero?
6166081	6167082	What did you think of what you saw?
6167742	6170685	A little bit, and what I saw, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it or not.
6171185	6179251	It just looked kind of girly to me, but I mean, I saw a couple battle scenes, I thought they looked really good, so I'm definitely going to be at some point picking it up.
6180232	6185296	The strategy guide is really cool, especially with the limited edition one, with all the artwork and stuff in it.
6186377	6205941	Going by reading some of that strategy guide and seeing some of the stuff I saw and from what other people have been telling me, I think that I actually will like it, because I really didn't like X too much, because it just, I don't know, I just didn't really get with the story, but it looks like this one, with its more fast-paced action, I think I'll be able to keep up with it a lot more and enjoy it.
6208533	6217099	It really does feel like you're coming in at the end of 10 because it's like what you can do is already advanced as far as where you can go.
6217739	6220021	And you get choices of different missions you can take.
6220761	6221201	It's neat.
6221842	6222442	I enjoy the game.
6225644	6228186	Okay, you guys want to know tonight's cage match winner?
6229427	6232229	Alright, let's unveil tonight's cage match winner.
6236299	6237039	Back to the cage match.
6237099	6243222	I've tallied up all the votes and we have a tie in tonight's cage match.
6243522	6244002	Yay.
6244722	6262990	There's a tie in tonight's cage match between Loki's pick, Battle Without a Honor or Humanity, the 88 Severed Lindenix, and between the Utah Saints song,
6266148	6266828	Oops, that's not it.
6268809	6269389	It's this one.
6269449	6269769	Sorry.
6270890	6271370	There it is.
6273991	6274551	That's the one.
6274571	6275251	Sorry about that.
6275571	6275951	My bad.
6278052	6278932	So we have a tie.
6280173	6282733	And in that case, I get to break the tie.
6284374	6285014	With a hammer?
6285394	6286975	Sorry, you can't send in house votes.
6287055	6287635	I'm on to you.
6289196	6290696	So I get to break the tie vote.
6291636	6292877	Oh, well, this is tricky.
6295382	6297004	Um, whereas, what?
6297745	6302231	There's a tie between the first and second songs tonight, and I get to break the tie.
6302751	6313364	And whereas, I think I do prefer Battle Without a Honor or Humanity, I didn't quite care for what Loki had to say about my cage match pick, so I'm choosing Jamie's cage match pick tonight.
6313384	6313805	Yay!
6315859	6318341	Oh no, now I have to make another song, oh no.
6318501	6326105	But, but, but, I would like to vote that I vote that that goes into permanent rotation.
6328807	6330528	Well, okay.
6332449	6333010	Sure, why not?
6333450	6334991	Since we're all Kill Bill fans anyway.
6338713	6341355	All right, so there we go.
6341455	6344257	So you'll hear both of those songs in Orange House Rotation pretty soon.
6346138	6349719	And yes, there were votes for the Mel C song, so don't go thinking.
6349739	6351839	By people who have no musical taste.
6351999	6354000	I don't like where you're going with that statement, buddy.
6354020	6356200	Hey, I gave you a 6 on that song.
6357420	6357820	6.8 even.
6361981	6363901	If she wasn't singing, it would have gotten a 9.
6365782	6366142	Okay.
6366502	6369803	We're going to take a quick break.
6369883	6371523	We're going to play that real emotion.
6373305	6376766	We're going to play that Real Emotion from Final Fantasy X-2 and something else in this break.
6377566	6379687	Then when we come back, we'll do the FUs of the week.
6380207	6381807	We have to skip forward, though, a little bit.
6381847	6383768	We'll probably play both versions.
6385588	6387089	We have the Japanese shortened up one?
6388149	6390229	Okay, so we'll play both versions then, I guess.
6391250	6395891	We're going to skip forward a little bit in this MP3, so pardon us while we navigate this MP3 a little bit to find you the actual words.
6396211	6399392	So we'll hear both the English and Japanese versions of Real Emotion.
6400801	6404054	and we'll be back with the FUs of the week so send those in over private message to Sky.
6432706	6433067	RUN!
6481008	6481149	Hey.
6481209	6481289	Hey.
6585561	6586534	What can I do for you?
6732342	6736504	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
6736765	6738445	Are you one of these staffers by Hollywood?
6738465	6741147	No!
6741247	6742588	Do we care what people think of us?
6743228	6745089	No!
6745169	6746510	Do we want people to kiss our ass?
6746990	6749892	Yes!
6751072	6755875	Extreme Bomani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
6757591	6766253	Hi everybody, we're back, and both versions of a real motion back-to-back there, and there's a third one out there too, Koda doing the English, but we don't have that currently.
6767373	6768794	We'll just have to play that later!
6769334	6769514	Yep.
6770434	6777436	Anyway, it's about time to get into the FUs of the week, but Jamie's not here just yet, so Loki, is there anything going on out there in the sim world you want to tell us about?
6778596	6778696	Um...
6780939	6793512	I guess, um, people are working on, um, skins for, you know, the rest of the Bomani games, like, you know, Extreme and stuff, uh, here, Poppin' Music's in development for Step Mania, support for that, and, um,
6796548	6803495	Key Sound BMS files for NinthStyle will be up on MyStyle later this week.
6818211	6823996	Also on SuperNova.org, they've got the hard drive images for some of the rest of the Beatmania games.
6824496	6825777	Almost all of them are covered now.
6826298	6829480	So if you have the latest version of MAME, you can play those as well.
6830241	6834985	So go get those if you want to play the actual arcade game of Beatmania.
6836426	6842411	And yeah, there's other stuff, but I can't mention the other stuff too.
6842951	6844413	But that's more local anyways.
6844773	6846935	So that's it.
6848044	6851686	Oh, and I'm sure people are going to be ripping Xbox stuff, but nothing yet.
6852366	6861430	And as I mentioned last week, DDR Fever stuff is available on DDRAmerica.org or whatever it is, I can't remember.
6862170	6867793	It's a DDR BitTorrent site, and you can download the craptastic songs that they have on there.
6869274	6869774	That's about it.
6872981	6883910	Okay, well, let's see, I think we're about ready to get into the FUs of the week, so you want to send those over to me, Sky, private message?
6888639	6891081	and try to limit yourselves on the FUs of the week.
6891121	6894484	I'm getting several people who are writing me novels this week and forget it.
6894844	6898406	I'm capping you guys after like three or four FUs because it's too much.
6899027	6902570	So there's a lot of people sending them tonight, so send me your best ones.
6903550	6907033	In the meantime, Jamie, what is the FU segment all about?
6907413	6909675	When we're pissed off and tell everyone about it.
6925560	6931943	Um, my first FU of the week goes to people who are consistently negative and have nothing positive to say.
6932603	6939366	Like someone who, um, never mind, I'm not naming names, but someone who is listening right now.
6940567	6942808	Now I'm not mentioning names, they know who they are.
6944403	6950386	Trust me, who always says, oh, this sucks, oh, that's not my style, or I don't like this.
6950767	6952728	It's always negative, always negative.
6952988	6958090	Anyway, another one goes toward having to go back to work.
6958851	6962593	Although, honestly, when I went back to work, we were having a Thanksgiving potluck.
6962633	6963153	It was pretty cool.
6965363	6974069	and of course it's also no longer our busy season of the year so we're really slow so I've got tons of time just to get stuff done and think.
6976830	6982814	Effie goes to my cat for meeting a bath so I have to go wash my cat.
6982834	6991560	I always need to make sure that the pussy's clean.
6994312	6995473	Well, at least she's well petted.
6995513	6997874	Anyway.
7000075	7009481	Another FU goes toward the upstairs room at my house for not being clean, so I have to clean that.
7009661	7010561	I don't want to do that.
7013123	7017105	And then all the stupid people in California, which are most everybody.
7017825	7018486	Not everybody.
7019186	7020147	There's smart people in this.
7020227	7022388	Everybody in this room I can say is an intelligent human being.
7023467	7026528	Most everybody else though sucks and none of them can drive.
7028929	7029689	Stupid people.
7030489	7036211	And another one goes toward me for leaving my aura gel at home because my tooth hurts.
7037411	7041393	And then, I think that's about it.
7041513	7043373	I'm really not full of angst today.
7044214	7044614	Oh yeah, 10-2.
7044634	7044614	10.
7044654	7045674	10.
7044894	7045674	Not angst.
7045874	7046034	Okay.
7053409	7062874	Oh yeah, and another one goes towards Square for closing the Final Fantasy XI beta right before I could install my beta copy.
7063194	7063815	Square Enix.
7064135	7064635	Squeenix.
7065616	7066056	Squeenix.
7066917	7067917	Big F you to Squeenix.
7069278	7072720	And then a F you toward me not having more money.
7072980	7073380	Okay, I'm done.
7075242	7075582	Matt.
7078824	7078924	Um...
7079926	7081627	The first one, well, it's kind of minor.
7081907	7089092	The first one was FU to Final Fantasy XI because I was wandering into a tomb where I didn't know I was going and I got jumped by two goblins.
7089392	7095516	See, now, if this were real life, I would kick the goblin's ass without thinking about it, but this is a game, so I can't do that.
7095536	7096857	You're playing an MMORPG.
7096957	7098018	Ha ha ha ha.
7098078	7099419	No, I'm playing Final Fantasy.
7099599	7100700	I play Final Fantasy.
7100880	7102781	I don't play online games.
7102841	7105103	You're playing an on... It's an online game!
7105646	7107206	It's half of an online game.
7107366	7108567	It's half Final Fantasy.
7109107	7111047	I'm only breaking half the rule.
7112848	7113768	You break half of it.
7113808	7114828	You break the whole thing.
7115708	7116408	You don't understand.
7116528	7118029	I'm playing it leisurely.
7118289	7119489	I'm not like going out there.
7119569	7123110	I have to be out there all day because I have to level up every day.
7123370	7123930	Every day.
7123950	7125110	Oh my god.
7125270	7130571	If I'm not in this world like most of my life, I don't know what I'm going to do.
7130852	7132532	I dedicate the Nelson laugh to you.
7135496	7137640	Um, Second Nephew goes to leaves.
7138080	7138982	I don't like leaves.
7139543	7145492	And the fact that every single leaf that's in this apartment complex fell, like, during one day.
7145933	7148397	It's just like it's snow outside, but it's leaves.
7149543	7151726	There's just like so many leaves out there.
7151846	7157832	It's kind of funny because the Mexicans were here the day before, like blowing off the leaves, like the few leaves that were there.
7158273	7162958	And then like a few days later, just every single leaf falls all at once.
7163338	7167523	Man, I wish I could see their sad face when they come to work, you know, next week.
7168163	7168944	But oh man.
7169625	7171207	Anyways, also...
7172805	7182309	Um, FU to, uh, stupid power outage that we had today, because that means I had to, you know, get up and do stuff, so that sucked.
7183189	7187871	Um, and, I don't know, I really don't have much.
7188192	7195395	Um, FU to people that are, like, doing this, they're talking about Michael Jackson and already, you know, victim him of, you know, molesting this child.
7196315	7200357	Here's my opinion on it, and you're going to listen to it anyways, because I'm making you.
7200977	7201037	Um...
7201880	7208287	Basically, I think he's an easy target and that they're just taking advantage of him because he's an easy target and a freak that sleeps with children.
7208828	7212472	Now, while he may be a freak that sleeps with children, doesn't mean that he's groping them.
7213012	7217637	So, you know, I just think he's just a freak, but I think he's innocent.
7217757	7221441	And yet people are like, man, I wouldn't let my kid next to that chum, Lester.
7222302	7223103	He's been convicted.
7223183	7224844	He hasn't even gone on the trail yet.
7224944	7226625	You haven't heard any of the details yet.
7227606	7228667	It's just, it's annoying.
7229027	7230528	But, I hate the media.
7231049	7246861	Because now they're talking about this instead of Kobe Bryant, and then, you know, next thing you'll hear is like, I don't know, Bob Barker will have, like, chicken heads stapled to his walls, and, like, some of the models will be missing, and he'll be a cannibal or something, you know, and that'll be that, so...
7247541	7249222	It's just like, it'll never end.
7249562	7252104	And thank God we don't have to hear about J-Lo at least.
7252324	7258729	She's probably pissed off that she's not getting any media coverage about her marriages or... I don't know if I should get married!
7259349	7259929	Maybe?
7260230	7260910	I don't know.
7261230	7261751	Maybe?
7262111	7262511	I don't know.
7262731	7263992	It's just like, it's really annoying.
7264172	7264733	I don't care.
7265673	7271737	You know, like, if something like that happened, Bob Barker would have a bunch of kittens and puppies killed all in his house.
7272198	7273779	And then he's talking about Spanning and Pets.
7276556	7278839	I just had a horrible thought and Rod's probably going to hate me for this.
7279640	7285346	He's probably got the preserved corpse of Rod Rod in his closet so that he can open it up.
7285646	7287388	What would you do in this situation, Rod?
7287428	7288049	What would you do?
7290251	7292414	I would sell it on eBay.
7293495	7295898	Anyways, um, yeah, I'm done.
7297791	7325325	Oh, FU to, um, Iron Chef, for not, like, last night we watched the, they tied, okay, so they go into an overcooked round, and, um, they had, the first round was the potato match, which was awesome, because I love potatoes, so, I was watching that, and then the next round was sweet potatoes, I was like, you know what would be cool, is if they put something in there that, like, no one would want to cook, like kittens, they should have the kitten, you know, Iron Chef cook off, and it would be great, because, you know, they'd just be like,
7326025	7330068	All grossed out and stuff, but they have to create awesome dishes using kittens.
7330949	7331489	Live kittens.
7332410	7333290	So, that's it.
7334151	7334451	I don't know.
7334471	7336072	I still want to see the live octopus one.
7337493	7338274	Like from the intro.
7339515	7340635	Giant alien.
7341696	7342156	Alright, I'm done.
7342417	7342857	Dog.
7343317	7343818	Horse meat.
7345379	7346059	Rob.
7346139	7346379	Rob.
7346399	7347400	Give me a mic.
7347660	7348741	Try giving me a microphone.
7348781	7349862	I'd love to give some FUs.
7352552	7379313	I have a couple FUs this week FU to the power going out earlier today that fucking sucked and I thought I thought you know what though FU for not staying off longer I wish it was still off right now then I would have had an excuse to just stay home and not do a show tonight true I could have just gone over to Jamie's but I would have taken the easy way out you would have left me to do this by myself no I would have taken the easy way out and said no show tonight but the power couldn't stay off longer I would have run away anyway because I love our listeners so do you
7380370	7381812	They could live without us for one week.
7381832	7384816	They could go outside and find something to do.
7385658	7386198	Let's see.
7386218	7392347	F you to people that hate on the show Survivor because it's cool to hate on reality TV.
7393048	7395412	Yet this show is still consistently in the top ten for some reason.
7396012	7419440	and the show rocks and yes this week sucked because the best person on it got voted out but the show itself is still good and next season is going to be like the best television ever so F you to people that hate on reality TV just because it's reality TV because this show rules the only reason it's doing so well is all those two year olds watching the show that and you know the other show anyways that sucked
7419898	7426242	Fucking A that he got voted off, but, you know, that's alright, because, you know, vicariously through someone else, he will have his revenge.
7426903	7430665	You know what, I kind of view, a lot of people hate on it, because, like, you know, it's fake or whatever.
7430745	7432166	I kind of view it as a sport.
7432646	7434928	For me, Survivor is my wrestling.
7435168	7442192	You have the drama, you have the competitions, you have it way played out, it's, you know what... But wrestling has hotter guys.
7443593	7444634	Mmm, I don't know about that.
7445515	7447396	If you like those muscle guys, meh.
7447964	7451326	Not all of them are... Yeah, they can make it on Survivor.
7452607	7457950	Okay, not all of the guys in wrestling are like Brock Lesnar where their neck muscles are growing out of their ears.
7458691	7460572	There's like the really hot guys like Billy Kidman.
7460952	7461432	He's hot.
7463113	7464114	Wrestling's okay.
7464214	7465915	It's just, you know, it's not my cup of tea.
7465955	7469497	But I don't hate on wrestling just because wrestling is popular.
7469798	7472339	Yet people hate on Survivor because Survivor's popular.
7472379	7473120	So I'm saying F you.
7474199	7477443	I don't watch wrestling because they don't wrestle against little kittens.
7477963	7481186	God damn it, I want to see the big people smash the kittens.
7481847	7483188	Is that so much to ask?
7485130	7489195	And to be honest, I actually rather enjoy wrestling when Chyna's involved, except she's gone now.
7489235	7490876	She's trying to be a singer now.
7491077	7494120	And I like it when they get out the tables and the ladders.
7494220	7495101	That's always entertaining.
7496024	7499106	The TLC net, tables, ladders, and chairs.
7499186	7499886	And cookie sheets.
7501147	7507390	I also liked how the one icon on Jamie's wrestling data for some game was a little spinning ladder.
7507810	7509751	Yeah, on the new SmackDown game.
7510011	7510431	That was cool.
7510571	7511152	It's a ladder.
7511652	7512532	Yes, that rocked.
7512972	7515694	Anyway, let's hear from other folks in our room.
7516734	7517715	Zero, you're up for use of the week.
7519355	7523337	Um, I can say fuck you to my car, obviously, because it's a piece of shit.
7524237	7527719	Um, fuck you to about half, no, not half the people.
7528219	7532521	Everybody in the mall except 14 of them, and those 14 of which I happen to work with.
7533322	7543526	Everybody else is a big group of assholes who don't know how to park and yell at you because some guy almost makes you crash into them, and yet they're the stupid asses who keep going and driving like they're stupid morons.
7544507	7544607	Um...
7546741	7550962	FU to still not having quite enough cash for absolutely anything.
7552062	7555683	FU to having to go to the dentist because that shit sucks.
7556744	7560405	Um, FU to Mortal Kombat 5, should have stopped at like 3.
7560685	7562665	There's a Mortal Kombat 5?
7563505	7566266	Supposedly, they already have screenshots of it and it looks totally stupid.
7566286	7568547	But I thought that's what Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance was supposed to be.
7568567	7569947	Deadly Alliance was Deadly Alliance.
7571360	7576322	I thought it was just Mortal Kombat 5, but they didn't call it Mortal Kombat 5 because they didn't put it in the arcades.
7576562	7579724	No, it's just Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance.
7579744	7583185	But now they're doing Mortal Kombat 5 because they realized, oh, Deadly Alliance is kind of popular.
7583225	7584546	Maybe we should have put it in the arcades.
7584586	7587787	Yeah, which is absolutely ridiculous because they should have stopped at the failure of 4.
7590268	7591469	Deadly Alliance was okay.
7591509	7593570	I mean, it was no Soul Calibur, but it was entertaining.
7593610	7595690	It was more entertaining than a lot of fighting games I've played.
7597671	7598632	Fatalities are still cool.
7599888	7604871	Fatalities all sucked on Deadly Alliance.
7606392	7612056	They didn't even put friendships or anything in there because those were the funniest out of everything.
7612796	7616739	Not really much else to say fuck you to because there's just not a whole lot going on.
7617539	7621682	But yeah, fuck you to people who are telling me I'm lying when I have proof of what I'm talking about.
7622422	7626044	And really, that seems to be about it.
7626084	7626925	I don't have a whole big
7631991	7646395	Well, we have, um, Jonas is here, hello This is Mr. Explosive himself And just realize that the FU music right now is the Butterfly Pikachu mix So you might want to keep it short I'm gonna keep it short, there's not gonna be any FUs though Alright, what's up?
7646615	7653617	The first FU is Bitches on the Damn Road Fucked up the, um, you know the, you know the song when you go down and it goes up?
7655037	7656978	Fuckin', um, scratch the bottom of my car
7658260	7658720	Yeah, Dips.
7660622	7662863	Yeah, I'm not sure if I'm gonna get a new bump or not.
7664544	7665465	Nah, I have speed bumps, though.
7665525	7670168	Just some... Hell nah, I'm not getting that crazy, but drop 70 miles an hour on speed bumps.
7672429	7673350	Anyways, anyways.
7674351	7678454	And the FU2 beat getting my right arm injured, in a way.
7679654	7681215	I'll show the videos later.
7683523	7693409	and basically not many FUs except for people emailing me about the upcoming tournament I'm trying to organize for April which I have no place at yet.
7693789	7695550	People saying, when is it going to be coming over?
7696311	7697251	It's coming soon.
7697271	7702374	And people are issuing about bar raping versus no bar raping on PA.
7703995	7708878	So that's a whole other discussion we could have later.
7709525	7711406	Yeah, I don't want to doubt you with that.
7711546	7713166	Some of the boys just read it, dammit.
7715867	7718388	And they have a few two fanboys all over.
7718408	7720929	All they talk about is the same old shit over and over and over.
7721590	7727072	How they say like, Neonix is cool, or Cloud is the best character, she should be in Final Fantasy.
7728312	7729333	All the Final Fantasys.
7730053	7730893	Etc, etc.
7731213	7735295	And especially the new, upcoming movie of Final Fantasy, Children's Advent.
7737561	7744503	I already know, you know what, as much as I love Final Fantasy 7, I'm already convinced this movie is going to be a huge disappointment, so... That's what I'm thinking.
7744543	7745603	I'm not looking forward to it.
7746223	7754285	I've already seen, like, The Spirits Within, but all I'm going to do is throw fanboy shit, like, ooh, let's throw in Cloud and Sephiroth, fight together, pow pow pow.
7755086	7756186	There, that's a movie.
7761507	7764308	But I'm not going to judge it from its cover, I'll see what happens.
7765997	7767278	I will judge it by its cover.
7767838	7768658	Big disappointment.
7770039	7770659	I'm just kidding.
7770699	7771599	I'll watch it, of course.
7773520	7775961	Okay, that's all I have to say for now.
7775981	7779162	Miko, do you have any FUs?
7779762	7781143	Yes, Miko, do you have any FUs of the week?
7782123	7782884	Not really.
7785265	7785685	Okay!
7787325	7789386	Then let's get on to our Charm FUs, shall we?
7791147	7793648	Jamie, would you like to enter an FU on behalf of Miko?
7795462	7796683	FU to not having an FU.
7796703	7797784	Alright.
7800366	7800866	Moving on.
7800886	7803288	What is up with this Mary Kay and Ashley DVD?
7804388	7804869	Moving on.
7805549	7813995	Zodiac Knight would like to give an FU of the week to Squeenix for using a sucky version of Real Emotion as the X2 opening song.
7814295	7815516	Okay, that version did not suck.
7817337	7820600	Darketsuyu would like to say FU to this cold that still hasn't gone away.
7821673	7850272	Jason would like to say, F you to Cable One, while I'm happy that I have cable, it's really stupid that me and my friend are separated by four houses and one street, and that he can't get cable, hurry the hell up, uh, fuck you boss, name withheld, for calling me fat, I haven't gained a pound in quite a while, Jason would also like to say, fuck myself, for not listening in a while, and not having a reason not to listen, yes, unpermissible, fired, you have a microphone, oh, the other ferret,
7852219	7853220	Where the hell did it go?
7853440	7854161	I threw it at you.
7854461	7856683	Well, then it's your fault for throwing it at me, isn't it?
7857884	7858365	Oh, here it is.
7859426	7860226	I don't throw it again.
7860847	7862509	Yeah, F you, Jason.
7862689	7863710	Shame on you for not listening.
7868494	7887649	DJ Dark Knight would like to say F you to the game attendants at my local Putt-Putt for not fixing the 2DX and initial D machines because the 2DX machines still have the black void on the top of the screen and you can't watch the videos and the initial D machine for not fixing the two player side wheel because of that I lost a match racing Friday night
7888902	7891726	Here's a suggestion, stop playing Initial D Hey!
7891766	7902402	Just kidding Here's a suggestion, get a JPS 2 and play it at home Play Initial D at home like I do Dark Child
7903888	7908653	DD Arcaholic, I don't know, I think it's Dark Child sending most of these FUs, but they keep switching their name back and forth.
7909914	7913979	Dark Child likes to say FU to people who call others stupid for saying things differently than they do.
7914880	7918223	FU to people who act one way and bitch at others for doing it themselves.
7918383	7923389	FU to the cat shit smell creeping in on me, and FU to Pillar Boy of GameStop Arden, whatever that means.
7925706	7930007	S-Ghost would like to say, F you to my job for being bipolar.
7930087	7935269	Last week they scheduled me less than 10 hours and this week they scheduled me 30 plus before schedule changes.
7936930	7938550	My boss and his wife are morons.
7938610	7941031	They should learn how to schedule before starting a business.
7941971	7942892	F you to my dreams.
7942932	7945893	I'm sick of being a Secret Service member for a bag of salad.
7947033	7947453	What?
7948473	7951914	I'm sick of being a Secret Service member for a bag of salad.
7951934	7953435	Okay.
7954750	7956391	Oddly enough, I always die at the end.
7956431	7958051	I think Freud would have a field day with me.
7959312	7961193	F you to anyone who thinks I'm a pervert now.
7961253	7965475	I was making a reference to an earlier statement like that tits equal veto power.
7965555	7968136	I'm not sexist, and I'm sorry if anyone thought I was.
7968416	7970417	But, but, but, but they do.
7972097	7974839	And F you to Gunbound for taking over my soul.
7974999	7975479	That's four.

7985125	7988307	F you to this freaking wait for Phantasy Star Online Episode 3.
7988827	7992649	And F you to everyone who can't time attack on Phantasy Star Online Change Mode.
7995550	7996370	I quit PSO.
7996531	7996971	Interesting.
7997191	7998271	Oh, you finally quit PSO?
7998331	8000372	We're canceling PSO to get Final Fantasy XI.
8000633	8001233	Good choice.
8002351	8005973	23rd Magus would like to say, F you to Insomnia, it lasted all week.
8006594	8009055	F you to screwing up on Karaoke Revolution last week.
8009095	8010075	Could have done better, folks.
8010836	8013157	F you to concert tickets being so damn expensive.
8013677	8016979	And F you to stats and sort of mana being incredibly unbalanced.
8017079	8019281	Thieves own all, not surprisingly.
8019661	8020961	And I'm set.
8022642	8026665	Jazz would like to say, F you to people who accuse me of cheating on Ultramix.
8026705	8030587	It's not my fault that you can't be as great as an arrow-smashing fairy as I am.
8033387	8033568	Aw.
8035269	8038432	From one arrow smashing fairy to another, you show them who's boss.
8040514	8043637	DJ Spector would like to say F you to my Spanish teacher.
8044018	8047341	F you to Sam's Club for not having the digital camera they supposedly had.
8048082	8050364	F you to school and F you to optical illusions.
8050424	8050965	And that's four.
8052489	8056331	Minst would like to say, F you to teen night at the DDR place by my house.
8056471	8059632	Home from college for break, and I forgot they did that on Fridays.
8059652	8063634	The place was filled with various small children acting even more stupid than usual.
8064595	8070337	Minst would also like to say, F you to people who angst over initial D. I've seen it for the first time and it's not a pretty sight.
8071858	8074519	Oh yes, and F you to being on dial-up for 10 days.
8075019	8080462	And F you to the people in the general area where I live, as for some reason they've decided it's now popular to goth.
8086413	8088635	Angel would like to say, I can't give you my F.U.
8088675	8090916	as much as I'd like to, but here we go.
8092758	8096060	Oh, she's trying to omit names and stuff.
8096740	8096981	F.U.
8097021	8100343	to friends hanging out with enemies and expecting me to be cool with it.
8100383	8102264	Stop trying to think that I'm friends with you still.
8102304	8102804	I'm over it.
8102844	8103565	Why can't you be?
8103585	8104786	Okay.
8106187	8106407	Okay.
8110237	8110838	S.A.E.
8111198	8113360	would like to say, Hey Sky, an F.U.
8113420	8116523	to Initial D for ruining my confidence to drive in real life.
8117283	8121247	Here's a hint, stop playing Initial D. Just teasing.
8122168	8122868	DarkLion.
8124897	8129259	16, XVI, whatever he prefers to be called, would like to say F you to sleep deprivation.
8129339	8132761	I didn't get any much sleep last Wednesday for some reason.
8133161	8134622	I slept at around 4 a.m.
8134662	8136683	and forced myself to wake up around 6 a.m.
8136723	8137863	to take my cousin to school.
8138844	8141565	F you to name changing in some of the games and anime in general.
8141746	8143386	I know there are some good name changes.
8143486	8145608	Today should at least be a good reason for it.
8146388	8151551	Lastly, F you to the tourists who visit the Adventure Dome, who break the Maman machines and act like idiots.
8154140	8155401	Okay, that's it.
8157342	8158603	Oh, Mika thought of an FU.
8159123	8160104	Alright, well, wait a minute.
8161244	8161784	Okay, go for it.
8163445	8166587	I would have to say FU to the people who don't wear seatbelts.
8169454	8198082	because Haley something from my school just passed away because she did not wear a seatbelt and she was driving in the pouring rain and speeding without a seatbelt so she lost out of control and she crashed into some other cars and she's dead well that's Darwinism for you
8199195	8199496	What?
8200036	8200277	Sorry.
8201338	8203482	Well, hard lesson learned, unfortunately.
8203522	8204043	It's too bad.
8205064	8205305	Wow.
8206987	8208029	At least she wasn't drunk.
8208650	8210873	At least she wasn't drunk and driving.
8210893	8212576	Because that's even worse, if you ask me.
8215802	8217483	You throw like a girl, Jonas.
8217603	8222746	I'm just kidding.
8225347	8225827	Ah, blow me.
8226207	8226568	Alright.
8227508	8227728	Wow.
8227748	8233991	I wish it was that easy.
8234292	8236833	I wish I could just walk up to some cute guy.
8236893	8237473	Ah, blow me.
8237793	8238093	Okay.
8239694	8240155	God.
8240535	8241735	I wish it was that easy.
8241775	8243216	Depends on where you go, when you go.
8243396	8244437	DarkSakura, yes.
8245302	8245802	You had a thought?
8250544	8251285	There was my thought.
8251385	8251985	Here's another one.
8254666	8255026	Hey, Rob.
8255726	8255947	Rob.
8256007	8256247	What?
8256807	8257387	What?
8257427	8257667	What?
8258148	8258408	What?
8258968	8259308	What?
8259868	8260168	What?
8262830	8263210	I hate you.
8263930	8266391	All right.
8266451	8267051	Let's see.
8267271	8269913	We are going to take a little breaky break here.
8271833	8272894	And when we come back...
8274850	8277492	We're going to play some more Ultramix, I think.
8278292	8280153	And we're also going to do some Ask Orange Lounge.
8281014	8281994	How's that sound, kids?
8282334	8282915	Sound like fun?
8284175	8285076	Yes, I thought so.
8285896	8287457	Alright, so we'll take a break.
8288578	8290699	And we'll be right back.
8291980	8295562	You can send those questions for Ask Orange Lounge now to me, Sky, in the chat room.
8301926	8307323	A little better you and me A little better such a friend

8639465	8642207	It's not going to be on Monday nights anymore, it's going to be on Wednesday nights.
8642607	8648712	Those of you that were listening to the show this week know that LankyStyle got a brand new job, which he started tonight, best of luck to him.
8649373	8652475	But it's going to require that he's not available Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday nights.
8652996	8656619	So instead, we're going to move the show to Wednesday so he can still be a part of it.
8657339	8685661	and because they've been really good on that show and we've talked about a lot of interesting game things and non-game things so if you haven't tuned into that you should also back live this week on Tuesday is my show pump up the volume the unabbreviated pump up the volume hint hint pre-show at 7 show starts at 7.30 hang out in the chat room if you make a request if I have it I'll play it it's that easy
8687068	8690342	And make sure that you get 20 people to sign in and listen to me this time.
8690904	8691386	Or I'll cry.
8695433	8702396	Okay, some of you may be asking yourselves, well, if Vanilla Sky is moving to Wednesdays, what's happening to LiveWire?
8703176	8708238	Well, I guess Loki would be best to answer that question, but I'll kind of answer it for him.
8708678	8711659	He's going to be doing some intermittent stuff on Monday nights from now on.
8711759	8717021	He doesn't really want to go through the effort to make a new LiveWire every single week, because believe it or not, it's a lot of work.
8718082	8722743	It's easier than just, you know, turn on the microphones and throw on some music like the rest of us do.
8724664	8729066	So he's just going to do some stuff for Mondays intermittently.
8729407	8732908	And hopefully we'll still have some special programming for you guys on Monday night.
8733529	8736750	And Condition Zero will be back one of these days, won't it?
8739131	8741172	Condition Zero will be back one of these days, won't it, Zero?
8741412	8741632	Yes?
8741793	8742433	Yeah.
8742513	8743453	Alright, good.
8744134	8746895	Alright, as promised, let's go back over to Ultramix.
8747095	8750777	And they've just unlocked BLT style.
8750857	8751717	So let's hear this.
8751817	8752698	Let's play...
8754784	8755805	Ooh, this might be too loud.
8755845	8756285	Sorry, guys.
8756305	8756685	Well, yeah.
8756705	8758186	So did on a fourth style.
8758306	8759186	Alright, play it.
8810947	8814069	Of course it's sped up just like you would have thought it would.
8814830	8815210	Huh?
8816571	8817592	Yeah, a little bit.
8820494	8823136	It's sped up the same way as it does here in the fourth style.
8852652	8858458	There's a lot of runs in this.
8859079	8867227	It's very... Jonas is saying it looks like a mix of Orion and A.
8873186	8873746	That was interesting.
8873766	8875967	It was a little fast, but it's cool, I guess.
8875987	8877727	Well, it's in 1.5 speed.
8877987	8878668	Some fun steps.
8882329	8887870	Alright, Chowroom wants to hear Shiny Disco Balls.
8895532	8896533	I like this song a lot.
8897753	8900954	I'm hoping they didn't fuck it up, but apparently Zero says they have.
8910106	8912801	Discord, Discord, Discord, Discord, Discord, Discord
8937467	8943318	Um, some folks in the room are saying this song has very karaoke steps to them, which, yeah, it kind of does.
8943338	8947325	A lot of disco, disco, one, two, one, yeah, very karaoke.
8954011	8961536	This song is definitely one that you'll want to edit for the fact it's like just, disco, disco, disco, and that's the steps throughout the whole thing.
8962096	8965778	And then when it gets cool, they just go back to what it was.
8966459	8968220	Like, right after this.
8968380	8969380	It's kind of disappointing.
8970301	8971602	Have you noticed any new katas?
8974517	8979461	There's, I think, Castle in the Sky is in CatEye.
8979601	8980102	I know that.
8980202	8981282	Oh, on doubles I know this.
8981383	8982443	On singles I know this.
8982463	8983444	Definitely not.
8984545	8986647	But this song is the worst.
8986767	8988228	So it would be freestyle-able though?
8988648	8989990	Yeah, it's freestyle-able.
8991211	8996555	Definitely, but if you're just trying to play it for fun, you're not going to find a whole lot in that one.
8999005	9003567	What I don't like is that they ripped the background from Fantasy from Max 2, the one by Lockout.
9004387	9005908	It's a total rip-off of that background.
9005948	9007348	Completely ripped off.
9009789	9010309	You know what?
9010349	9012550	This song over music sucks, though.
9021533	9025095	Chatroom wanted to hear the edit of Castles in the Sky, so here you guys go.
9025775	9027536	And the background is a castle in the sky.
9027596	9028076	Go figure.
9061952	9064433	I was expecting there to be a slowdown there, but no.
9064893	9066133	It slowed down marginally.
9067274	9070054	It's still slowing down.
9070294	9071035	Lots of freezes.
9071955	9074496	No, it's a consistent tempo change like with Insertion.
9086465	9097632	Yeah, you usually don't see 16th note runs like that in licensed ones Yeah, there's been quite a few in this Some strange gallops there
9129566	9130086	Interesting.
9130366	9131126	It wasn't so bad.
9132007	9135187	Okay, and some folks wanted to hear the Metal Gear one, so we'll play that too.
9140968	9143629	We're playing a DDR Ultramix here on Orange Lines Radio.
9148770	9151210	Oh, this isn't the one I was thinking it was.
9151250	9154671	No, it's the one from 6 and Core Home Version.
9209008	9210388	I'm kind of surprised this is only a 7.
9210869	9213709	It's a little more 8-ish to me, especially with the 16s in it.
9213749	9214409	Oh, it is an 8?
9214550	9216110	This doesn't look that hard at all.
9217310	9218531	I'm sorry, this looks more like a 6.
9218971	9220231	It doesn't look hard to us.
9220271	9222652	We're kind of jaded because we've beaten, you know, kind of stuff.
9222672	9227633	But usually songs, once they get 16th notes in them and stuff, they're 8s.
9227653	9229774	So that's all it surprises me.
9229894	9231254	I would honestly rank this song a 7.
9235995	9237976	But if they're opposing, they're easy to do.
9239548	9242590	If it's just the same step being repeated, it's easy.
9243451	9244011	Hmm.
9244031	9245012	Very interesting.
9256708	9258249	So folks want to know what the videos are like.
9258329	9262432	Pretty much all the videos are just generic videos, just like you'd see in Max 2.
9262472	9263473	They're recycled stuff.
9263533	9268476	It looks like there are some new inserts, but even the new ones are pretty generic stuff.
9268496	9270977	You know, lights and colors and dumb things like that.
9271017	9276361	The only song that has a music video to it is the one with the half-naked men in it.
9276621	9277562	The Maasai one.
9278062	9278662	Do that thing.
9279623	9280343	That was the only one.
9283545	9284686	So is that it for Ultramix?
9284706	9285807	Do you guys want to play one more or what?
9289568	9294330	Okay, we're going to do Keep Your Body Movin' by Thuggy D. Yeah, I played that one.
9294870	9295890	Oh yeah, yeah, you did that one.
9295910	9297791	We're going to do the There For You.
9297811	9299251	It's the one you haven't heard.
9300632	9300812	No.
9300872	9305514	Alright, we're going to do There For You by Thuggy D. This will be the last one for now.
9305634	9306634	And then we'll do Ask Orange Lounge.
9319528	9323172	Yeah, one thing that sucks about this, for some reason, it can't run at slow speeds.
9323752	9325574	It starts getting all jittery and crap.
9326195	9330198	And it says it's like it's trying to load everything up, which it's the Xbox and it should be able to do it.
9330619	9334523	But on really slower songs, it's almost like the arrows start shaking.
9334543	9336424	It has the solo dogs.
9350268	9351429	You know what?
9351669	9352610	I don't like freeze arrows.
9353551	9359075	I don't like freeze arrows.
9360296	9362398	Freeze arrows are good when used in moderation.
9363158	9367682	Yeah, but too many ones are just excessive on the freeze arrows.
9368522	9371265	And the thing is, I don't play with freeze arrows anyway because of my angle.
9377009	9379131	Yeah, Shining Polaris freeze arrows was real much...
9401843	9402684	Wee, that was fun.
9404245	9405266	That song did not excite me.
9405286	9406367	That background looks very familiar.
9410670	9411591	No, it's not Eat You Up.
9419397	9420738	Alright.
9421479	9426543	The one thing in the 2DX video, because for the one for Let's Talk It Over, just had this girl there.
9427455	9428536	Remix Remix Remix
9465420	9465942	Remix
9519665	9524489	Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Solid Snake, can you hear what I'm saying?
9524729	9533216	Well, this time the chicken man, they won't step back I'm gonna kill, I'm gonna beat him, kill him all Damn, what am I gonna do?
9533256	9534337	Damn, what am I gonna do?
9535278	9536419	Damn, what am I gonna do?
9536439	9542604	Damn, damn Have you ever seen a cool game like this?
9647545	9648506	Thanks for watching!
9696212	9697133	Thank you for watching!
9724857	9728158	This is a heartbeat This is a heartbeat
9749893	9751814	Alright, welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
9751854	9753235	Here we are, Season 4 Premiere.
9753275	9754475	Hope you're enjoying it so far.
9756256	9763700	We're going to MP3 Pro soon, probably over Thanksgiving, so don't be surprised if you hear a lot about how we've gone MP3 Pro.
9764381	9774306	All that means is that if you have a special codec installed on your MP3 player, that you will be able to hear DSL quality streaming at a dial-up.
9775177	9776518	Thank you for watching!
9794052	9794933	10 bucks for a 56k modem.
9795034	9797016	I will buy you a modem.
9797036	9805024	If you are seriously on 28.8 still, fucking email us at orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com so we may mock you openly before the switch.
9805044	9806586	But it'll take them an hour to email us, Rob.
9806606	9807667	Yeah, it'll take them an hour to email us.
9808087	9810350	But if you're on 33.6 or 56k, you'll still be fine.
9810890	9812152	But the bitrate will be up in a little bit.
9815296	9827581	Alright, I think my cell phone connects to the internet faster than 28.8, that's fucking sad Okay, as promised, we have a whole fucking ton of questions for this tonight, so let's get to it
9834130	9837112	Let's Ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
9837772	9840834	Will that ferret ever shut the fuck up on this show?
9841554	9842655	I sure don't think so.
9843175	9848238	As long as Jamie's around, she's gonna drive me nuts with that fucking ferret until I set it on fire.
9849459	9851520	Alright.
9852380	9855442	Question number one tonight, from Zodiac Knight.
9857273	9861536	What Bomani songs of those that were never released on any DDR mix before?
9861957	9869202	So what Bomani songs, not on a DDR mix yet, would you guys and gals like to see come out in future downloads for Ultrix?
9872725	9876008	Infinite Prayer, Floating Flock Isn't that on there?
9876728	9879911	No, that's... Oh, so the original Infinite Prayer, so you want Floating Flock, okay.
9880991	9881572	That it, Amor?
9883474	9883894	Uh, Loki.
9885615	9888097	Um... Oh, crap.
9888657	9891279	Um... DJ Army.
9893900	9896582	And, well, speaking of official, though, The Safari.
9897082	9897462	Duh.
9897983	9901925	Um, for me... All the other tech songs that weren't released.
9902245	9905987	Um, Power... Bad Bye Baby Balloon is already in DDR.
9906128	9908329	He asked for ones that are already in DDR, Migo.
9910994	9912435	Starmind, Power Dream, Akira Yamaoka, Bitmania
9933722	9935663	Love Me Do would be fucking the shit.
9936223	9940084	Showa, the night style, the other night style one that's not Lion Suki.
9940404	9943665	But Lion Suki would be good too, so just about anything in Kiriyamaoka.
9943805	9944285	Panorama.
9944785	9947706	Or Goonies Are Good Enough from Poppin' 10, please.
9947886	9948146	Thank you.
9948226	9948686	Panorama.
9949186	9949386	Yes.
9951447	9955008	Anybody else have a thought for Bomani songs for Ultramix downloads?
9956488	9966074	I think it would be cool to either see Traces, either the original or the remix, or to see... I can't think of it right now.
9967935	9968856	Crap, I went blank.
9968876	9971378	But it would be cool to see a good QQQ.
9971598	9972979	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, Rizlam.
9973399	9973839	Rizlam, please.
9973959	9974259	Rizlam.
9974780	9975260	Okay.
9977441	9982465	Wouldn't it be cool if we knew someone that could make an upgrade for an arcade cabinet?
9983766	9985527	And they could put all these songs in there.
9986613	9987293	That would be cool.
9987333	9988754	Yeah, that would be fucking great.
9988794	9990535	Let's listen to the answer to the question.
9992015	9992395	Let's see.
9992435	9994396	What songs for the Bebani?
9994436	9994936	Let me see.
9994956	10001959	There's some songs from DDSInfalls.com that seem good, like the V-Techno remix or the Abyss, the Heavens mix.
10004020	10004900	That would sound good.
10006201	10006521	Cool.
10008121	10009622	I like 23rd Magus' idea.
10009682	10010662	You should too, Jamie.
10011063	10011583	Schlagwerk.
10011683	10013564	How about Schlagwerk?
10013904	10014364	You know what?
10015287	10016027	Fuck 2DX.
10017488	10020689	Let's put some Loki remixes in a DDR machine because he's got some pretty sweet ones.
10021009	10021749	Miko, you have an idea?
10022509	10023569	I like Monkey Dance.
10023789	10024410	Monkey Dance.
10024550	10027971	Yeah, and I also like, what is it called, Deadline.
10028851	10030051	Oh, Deadline would be a good one.
10030091	10030971	Yeah, Deadline would be great.
10030991	10032452	What about Beauty of Silence?
10034833	10035173	All right.
10036453	10036793	Cool.
10036933	10037193	Thanks.
10037573	10037813	Okay.
10038514	10040134	Let's go on to the next question, shall we?
10040154	10041995	Dark Child.
10043939	10044700	How long is it really?
10044720	10045741	Limp and fully extended?
10045761	10046642	Zero is going to answer this.
10046662	10050607	I don't know how he knows the answer, but he wants to answer this.
10064895	10068638	Well, if I bend at the elbow, it's about a foot long.
10068678	10070579	God damn it, you stole my joke.
10071520	10075123	If I put my arm straight out, it's about... I would say kind of limp.
10075163	10085951	My finger is about two and a half inches, and when I fully extend that middle finger, as I'm doing right now, when I fully extend that middle finger, I think I'm hitting a good three inches there.
10086612	10089234	It's not about the size of the boat, it's about the motion in the ocean.
10089254	10091816	Okay.
10094059	10097582	It's as big as you can airbrush it.
10097682	10103167	John Fields would like to know, will you please play my remix of Air for everyone to hear?
10103407	10103587	No.
10105789	10106629	Maybe in the afterbirth.
10108311	10112194	S Ghost would like to know, do you know why all the release dates for Ultramix are screwed up?
10113155	10114176	I didn't know they were screwed up.
10114816	10116497	Let's say thank you to Microsoft.
10116718	10118179	Let's ask the guy that works at GameStop.
10121866	10122426	I believe you.
10123407	10126489	No, it's actually not that the release dates were messed up.
10127070	10139738	It's that they, at the last minute, announced, basically about four days before they decided to do it, that instead of being out on December 3rd, it was actually going to be out with the pad and the game packaged.
10140118	10141439	It was going to be out on the 18th.
10141559	10143741	It was kind of something they didn't really push out.
10144501	10151646	And then, as far as I know, check it, December 3rd has always been the original release date.
10157011	10160274	I'm getting yelled at for not answering that limp question, honestly.
10162195	10162716	Let's see.
10163036	10164037	Microflacid.
10164698	10168061	Ninst would like to know, this is a good question being asked by Ninst here.
10168841	10172805	Why, oh why, are Magus' jokes so horribly bad?
10173646	10174046	Okay.
10175928	10178150	Look at the originator of the jokes.
10178170	10178330	What?
10180146	10181989	and the amount of a true sense of humor.
10182549	10183250	You're so mean.
10183791	10184332	I know I am.
10184372	10184973	That's why I'm here.
10186695	10186935	No.
10187956	10190580	It's just like you have to understand your place in this world.
10190840	10193864	I wasn't meant to sing, so I try not to.
10194385	10197189	He wasn't meant to be funny, so he should try not to.
10199699	10200559	See, it's really cool.
10200579	10201740	You gotta look at it this way.
10202240	10208563	Okay, his jokes are so bad because he takes all that power from his freestyling and he puts it into his jokes.
10209264	10214546	And it just makes him so bad that, I mean, you know, you can't help but say a horrible error.
10217387	10224471	Speaking of freestyle, imagine how he's gonna... I wonder what the judge is gonna say if he even participates in the tournaments.
10226752	10227292	Go ahead, Jonas.
10228928	10230949	But, that's all I got to say.
10232389	10232889	No comment.
10234029	10239411	You're saying fuck you to Jamie when I'm the one who just totally, like... Buffer.
10239591	10242071	Don't forget there are about a minute and 30 seconds left.
10242091	10245252	That's all I got to say, you know.
10246593	10251094	But you know what, in all seriousness, he's a good sport for putting up with our shit, because we're really fucking mean to him.
10252114	10255755	I swear, just translate it into Portuguese and he'll be hilarious.
10257498	10258919	Even funnier if he tries to read it.
10263082	10263442	Okay.
10265343	10265824	Moving on.
10265864	10268125	Shit happens, 23rd of August.
10270307	10272088	Yeah, shit happens, but eventually you flush.
10274870	10275190	Alright.
10276107	10282769	Dark Tetsuya would like to know, did Jamie ever get to hear QQQAzar, and if so, what were her thoughts on it?
10283389	10284110	Um, no.
10284130	10285070	There's two versions.
10285150	10287231	There's the one that Angel did, and there's the one that Loki did.
10287471	10289891	So there's two versions, and she's heard neither one.
10290231	10291372	No, that I ever have, yeah.
10291832	10293553	So, maybe we'll send them to her later.
10297154	10297994	Um, let's see.
10300075	10301435	DJ Dark Knight.
10301975	10303136	Oh, he has DJ in his name.
10303156	10304156	He must be a 2DX player.
10304416	10304516	Hmm.
10305871	10307393	Just messing, just messing.
10307934	10308615	I don't like that shit.
10308635	10311800	I don't like people that try to tell other people what they can and can't put in your name.
10311960	10314865	If you want to be DJ whatever, go fucking for it.
10318377	10318897	Thank you for watching!
10341912	10342854	Did you have something you wanted to say?
10342874	10346339	I was going to say F you for people who call themselves DJs and everything.
10346720	10347541	Well, you know what?
10348022	10348383	Let them.
10348883	10350206	What does it take to be a DJ?
10351474	10352094	Not a lot.
10352614	10353134	Look at us.
10353214	10353875	Oh, yeah.
10353915	10354435	Look at us.
10354615	10355735	We're radio DJs.
10356215	10362797	I have every right, by those standards, if you have to be a real DJ to call yourself DJ whatever, I have every right to go around and call myself DJ Sky.
10363057	10366158	And she can call herself DJ DarkSakura, and he can call himself DJ Loki.
10366418	10368138	We... What do we do?
10368178	10369098	We're on the radio.
10369318	10369838	Yeah, that's right.
10369878	10370699	So we're radio DJs.
10371039	10371519	Exactly.
10371759	10372099	Exactly.
10372139	10373559	So we have every right to call ourselves DJ.
10373699	10375520	And my DJ Celica is actually from 2DX.
10377440	10378561	I don't want to be a DJ.
10378721	10380081	I didn't like her in Full House.
10388098	10388359	Okay.
10389823	10391006	Oh yeah, he did have a question.
10391548	10392511	Oh, a question.
10393317	10397818	I heard rumors that Sony was going to do a karaoke revolution game themselves.
10397898	10398878	I saw it on a website.
10398938	10399518	Is that true?
10400119	10402959	Meaning that Sony was making a karaoke revolution type game themselves.
10403819	10405100	Yeah, there is something like that.
10405120	10415022	Well, we did report it on Vanilla Sky earlier this week that Sony has asked the folks behind the iToy, because the iToy has done so well, to look into the possibilities of doing something karaoke related.
10415882	10416163	Stop!
10416603	10416703	Stop!
10430555	10431515	I don't care!
10431535	10432816	How's it going under my foot?
10433016	10433776	I swear!
10455993	10457674	Oh, I have to address this in the chatroom, though.
10457974	10460595	They're saying that they have the right to call themselves BJ.
10461515	10462475	Then go do it!
10463195	10468917	Anyways, no, um, you don't happen to remember that one karaoke game I showed you at the store.
10468937	10471158	I do remember that, the one in the really ugly box.
10471258	10474339	Yeah, the one we put at the very back of the store, hopefully nobody would see.
10474759	10475800	Yeah, piece of shit.
10476760	10479661	That's what... What the fuck would I play that shit for?
10479681	10480401	I'm just curious.
10480881	10485143	The only cool thing, it comes with three discs of karaoke music and nothing else, because it's shit.
10489474	10490535	No, you threw it too low.
10491996	10493077	You know what?
10494198	10496360	I hope no one buys that because you know what's going to happen.
10496380	10498741	If one person buys it, they'll send your store 20 copies.
10502044	10502424	Alright.
10502985	10504846	Maybe I ought to go in and buy it then, just to see.
10507368	10508469	You know what?
10508529	10513013	One of the things I'm thinking of doing is actually getting the PC version of Pump It Up.
10514194	10514314	Okay.
10514744	10518526	To get the new one with all the newer songs on it, though.
10519787	10522089	So I can play it in my new room upstairs.
10523650	10523910	All right.
10524150	10525771	I love Pump It Up.
10525791	10527312	We'll have more news on that as we know it.
10527352	10528473	But Namtai's working on something.
10528493	10530334	They're also doing a dance game for the iToys.
10530394	10533436	So they're ripping off Konami's ideas left and right.
10533476	10534377	So we'll see what happens.
10535836	10536957	Jazz has a question.
10537678	10539699	When is Rob on Final Fantasy XI?
10540440	10544483	You can find me on the Bismarck server on Final Fantasy XI, usually in the evenings.
10545403	10547104	Loki has a smart ass answer, I'm sure.
10548646	10549186	All the time.
10550347	10551948	I was just going to say I was on there too.
10552429	10557172	Since he says I have a smart ass answer, yeah, he's always on there because he doesn't have a life.
10557613	10559634	He just plays Final Fantasy XI all the time.
10559734	10560235	And sleeps.
10560475	10561255	I'm on there too.
10561376	10562236	I'm Tomosuke.
10562316	10565399	You'll see me butchering rabbits left and right because that's what I do.
10566239	10566900	You butcher rabbits.
10566920	10568281	I butcher small, innocent animals.
10568541	10571764	Since there's no kittens in the game, rabbits will have to suffice.
10572824	10573105	Okay.
10573925	10574265	You know what?
10574305	10576827	I don't know that I can play that game because I got motion sick watching Rob.
10578749	10579590	Just play it blindfolded.
10580544	10581016	Blink Blink
10584342	10585183	Play more Ragnarok.
10585623	10586023	All right.
10586544	10589225	You can play on the Ragnarok server or from SC11.
10589806	10589986	No.
10590246	10590847	I'll play Ragnarok.
10590867	10591147	Thank you.
10592147	10592508	Okay.
10593388	10593949	Almost done.
10593989	10595009	No more questions, please.
10595069	10596330	We have to wrap up this segment.
10597751	10603475	Jazz would also like to know, and why don't you listen to me and check out Graduizic Cyber on Doubles Wii?
10603855	10606037	It's not Graduistic.
10606057	10607638	It's Graduizic.
10608198	10608598	Whatever.
10608618	10609239	It's Gradius.
10609659	10612601	New 10-footers, especially on American Mix, should get talked about.
10614707	10616088	It's a new 10-footer on doubles.
10617269	10617609	Yay.
10618329	10619350	Hooray, 10-footer.
10619430	10621871	It would be nice if it was easier to play doubles at home.
10625714	10626494	Oh my God.
10627615	10633379	That's the first Otakuto video reference I've seen in like 20, like forever.
10636480	10643285	Jason would like to ask, why is it that when I have Orange Lounge Radio turned up high and Papa Music 8 turned up just enough to hear it,
10644076	10650458	that I can do so much better on songs than when Papa Music Aid is blaring and of course the only music sound being made.
10651198	10653519	So why is it when Orange Lounge Radio is on he does even better?
10655740	10656220	Any thoughts?
10656400	10657660	I don't think that that made sense.
10657720	10661141	Because our enchanted voodoo powers make it possible.
10664362	10665343	Because we're great.
10665663	10666263	End of story.
10669223	10696670	and Dark Child would like to know how long is my penis but unfortunately we're out of time so we'll have to table that question next week sorry gang and we're going to close up the whole I'm such a bitch we're going to close up the whole little Ask Orange Lounge hope you learned something and now it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought Zero, your final thought for tonight
10697785	10699786	If you don't know how long it is, you probably can't see it.
10700667	10701908	Hey now, I don't like where you're going with that.
10703449	10704630	That's kind of where it stops.
10704670	10705070	Shut up.
10706491	10707071	Jeez!
10708893	10709453	Moving on.
10712095	10712615	Who's next?
10712895	10713235	Jonas.
10713976	10714796	Any last words?
10714816	10715937	Any final thoughts?
10717999	10719560	Not really much thought about it.
10719720	10719820	Just...
10722000	10724161	Really not much.
10724361	10728662	Except the fact that I got 23rd Magus thinking about the next tournament, what he's going to do.
10730142	10731883	Dude, Dark Child, you know I'm joking.
10732043	10732323	Shut up.
10733864	10734224	Alright.
10735964	10737985	Miko, any last thoughts?
10738545	10739185	Any final words?
10741506	10742066	About what?
10742746	10743366	About anything.
10743947	10744587	Your final thought.
10744607	10745607	Jerry Springer's final thought.
10745627	10745987	What is it?
10749188	10749928	Be safe.
10750589	10751289	Okay, be safe.
10752452	10780192	DarkSakura, be happy too, be happy too, DarkSakura, your final thought, Portobella Mushroom, Portobella, Portobella, is that it, alright, Loki, your final thought, go visit Japanese sim file sites, because they're better than US ones anyways, because I just decided to do that, my final thought is, hi,
10782733	10783073	I guess.
10783433	10784634	I guess I have nothing better to say.
10784874	10785474	I like cheese.
10786055	10786655	Yes, Jonas?
10786855	10788096	I got one more to say.
10788116	10788696	Something extra?
10789657	10790037	Okay.
10790778	10791578	Here's some advice.
10792019	10794280	Quit the goddamn Edison, Bimani style.
10794340	10798483	No one wants to play a 10-foot Edison from Max 300 or Pink Dinosaur or whatever.
10798543	10800024	It's time.
10801224	10801985	It's been a 10-
10809440	10817383	I have a word of advice for those folks making 10-foot edits to Max remixes and things like that.
10817643	10818563	Go outside.
10818803	10819383	Seriously.
10819583	10821624	Go outside and take in some fresh air.
10821864	10822344	Seriously.
10822824	10823145	Please.
10823285	10823965	Make some friends.
10824145	10824765	Get a girlfriend.
10824785	10825205	Get laid.
10825525	10826105	Do some good.
10826706	10827006	All right.
10830032	10834076	Tonight's final word, I'm going to give tonight's final word of the show to Miko.
10834637	10838260	So one word, one word that sums everything up for you Miko right now.
10841063	10842024	A one letter word?
10842264	10843926	Just one word, no one word.
10844186	10844667	One word.
10846108	10846529	Bye.
10846549	10846609	Bye.
10847563	10850545	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
10851105	10854447	Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.
10855047	10860251	Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
10860491	10870937	If you'd like to leave us a comment, send us an email at orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
10871870	10874231	I grew up in San Francisco.
10874652	10880054	I grew up in the midst of Polk Street, Hanky Code, Poppers, San Francisco.
10880615	10881915	So that's like my childhood.
10881995	10884677	So I feel really comfortable in talking about it.
10884717	10891380	My parents owned a bookstore on Polk Street, and my mother was in charge of the gay porn.
10892661	10893802	Which is like crazy.
10894642	10897904	She would pull out these books and show me to talk about it.
10899642	10904706	This book, this book, it's called Ace Master.
10910931	10912553	What is an Ace Master?
10914874	10915555	What is that?
10915695	10917096	I don't know what Ace Master is.
10917136	10918838	Why do you need an Ace Master?
10923641	10925503	This book is an Ace Master.
10929989	10934832	I thought this is a gay, the book for gay, because mommy know about the gay.
10937214	10940335	The gay, they like ass.
10940956	10941616	They do.
10942337	10944498	They like ass so much.
10945098	10949721	They like ass, but they like ass too much.
10953163	10956365	You hear two people, ass in moderation.
10966480	10968622	You cannot have an ass all the time.
10968642	10969843	You know?
10972325	10978149	Because if you have an ass all the time, then it's not special.
10983854	10985215	You know what mom is saying?
10985235	10986056	Like that, that is...
10987116	10989840	There is a boy, and his name is Paul.
10990361	10992003	And mommy like Paul.
10992044	10997372	He's a nice boy, but he's gay, and he only like to sing.
10997812	10999214	He like A.S.
10999455	11000396	and Judy Garland.
11000456	11000957	And that's all.
11006269	11008631	And what kind of life is it like that?
11010293	11011174	That's all.
11011975	11016919	You know, there's an ace and an ace over the rainbow, and that's all.
11019842	11021403	I don't know why they do this.
11024146	11026829	Well, I have to look at this book with the ace, mister.
11028630	11030212	Somebody's going to look at this book.
11030512	11031433	I'm going to look at it.
11032526	11035248	Mami, look at Mami, gonna look at Ace Mister now.
11035448	11040912	Mami gonna look at Ace Mister now, look at Mami, okay, look at Mami, look at Mami.
11042593	11043293	Ace Mister.
11056029	11060771	I can't... I thought I was shocked, you know.
11061911	11063452	I was so shocked.
11063892	11066092	It was just ass right away, you know.
11066172	11071154	It was a miracle.
11071274	11075816	Oh my God.
11077006	11080089	Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
11123908	11130493	Welcome everybody to the Orange Lounge Radio Afterbirth for the parts that were too hot for Orange Lounge Radio.
11130533	11131394	You can hear them now.
11133295	11135717	So any afterbirth thoughts, Jamie?
11139741	11141622	You were looking at some interesting movies earlier.
11144264	11145305	I think your mic might be off.
11146546	11147767	Check the mic, make sure it's not off.
11149088	11152691	This has got Sable in it in a bad fake porn thing.
11153531	11155153	But it's widescreen so it's forgiven.
11156674	11158675	Because Pan and Scan sucks.
11159716	11161137	Yeah, I don't like Pan and Scan either.
11162758	11165700	Pan and Scan is bad because you lose a part of the picture.
11167382	11171805	Everyone who says that the black bars cut off the screen is an idiot.
11172903	11175465	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
11202856	11203516	A show-a-thon?
11203596	11204517	We need a show-a-thon.
11204637	11205037	How so?
11205557	11208438	Like, just take those two DVDs and watch them back-to-back.
11208998	11209559	Fine by me.
11209819	11211759	And I have her new CD, except I left it at work.
11212760	11213540	Don't.
11215041	11215661	It's okay.
11215741	11219142	And then, just to break up the show-ness, watch Rejected.
11220103	11220423	Okay.
11220963	11229066	You know, I hear that on Bitter Films, that Made Rejected has a new compilation coming out, which should be good.
11229893	11230974	It's going to be a bunch of their stuff.
11231234	11233955	And they showed Billy's Balloon at Spike and Mike's and that made me happy.
11233975	11235156	Because Billy's Balloon is great.
11235176	11237057	Because I love when balloons beat up little children.
11239459	11240379	Have you seen Billy's Balloon?
11240599	11240739	No.
11240840	11241700	That's fucking great.
11241720	11242300	You've got to see it.
11245162	11252847	I guess that's pretty much it for our little afterbirth.
11254788	11256269	Tonight in the post-show...
11257625	11260186	I'm going to start it off with that air remix I promised.
11262027	11262767	If I can find it.
11262908	11264128	I know I've got it in here somewhere.
11265409	11266549	TikTok, TikTok, TikTok.
11268010	11268530	I had it.
11268750	11269431	Did I get rid of it?
11272252	11273913	I don't think I would have deleted it, but I don't.
11273973	11274413	Oh, there it is.
11274593	11275073	There it is.
11275854	11277995	If your anus is bleeding, use a tampon.
11278415	11281016	I just got a copy of this Japanese say of max 30,000.
11282357	11283377	It's two seconds long.
11287045	11290207	That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard of in my entire life.
11290227	11295731	Are you going to play it?
11295771	11298233	For the word of God and all that is holy.
11298633	11299033	Play it.
11299073	11300774	My anus is bleeding.
11300814	11302195	We're going to hear max 30,000.
11305858	11306318	Wow.
11306458	11307339	That's great.
11308960	11310801	That sounded like me shitting.
11312442	11315945	That sounds like a robot taking a shit.
11317303	11317944	Aw, bye, Zero.
11318124	11318464	Bye.
11318644	11319345	Nice knowing you.
11319425	11319645	Bye, Nico.
11319665	11321066	Have fun staying in the castle.
11321106	11321526	Take care.
11322007	11341441	Okay, tonight's post-show, we're going to start it off with that Air remix, and then after the Air remix, we're going to go into that Now Dance 2004 compilation from Britain, because it's neat, and lots of good songs in it, including some Kylie Minogue, some Ian Van Dahl, and some other artists you may know from Bomani releases.
11342081	11342441	Enjoy.
11342501	11343042	Have a great night.
11449123	11474999	Pretty Green Eyes It's full of sparkle and such light And let me remind That you chose not to cry But it's alright For your lover has come home By your side alone with me You'll never ever be alone
