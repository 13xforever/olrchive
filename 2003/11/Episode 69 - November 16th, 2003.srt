1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,240
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Lonnie Toss and then some.

3
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,520
Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

4
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,520
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

5
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:36,520
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

6
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,520
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,520
Yes, I will spank your child.

8
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,520
If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,520
Well, here's to my big opening.

10
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,520
A sphincter says what?

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,520
I'm super. Thanks for asking.

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,820
You little bitch troll from hell!

13
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,520
What am I doing here?

14
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,520
Nooo!

15
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,520
Dodge this.

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,520
Mm-hmm. This is a tasty burger.

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,220
Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left!

18
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,020
It's a house? Look!

19
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,320
It's a flesh wound.

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:18,420
Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a polyshorn.

21
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,020
Oh, yeah? Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

22
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,220
Dark Sakura.

23
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,580
I'm not a sniff

24
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,080
Sky

25
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,500
But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer

26
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,260
Loki

27
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,580
I hate you

28
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,580
Orange Lounge Radio

00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,580

Wait for it

34
00:01:50,580 --> 00:02:03,620
You're tuned into the bimani scenes most sexually charged for 99 cents a minute, radio station

00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:09,740

43
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,900

00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,540

64
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,540
there's no turning back now

65
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,540

66
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:37,540
episode number 69 so you know we had to do something for it cuz it was kind of

67
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,380
starting to feel anti-climatic you know with Jamie not here unfortunately and

68
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:47,340
just yeah yeah the one thing that's not going to be climactic tonight I think

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,340
we're just I don't think anybody in that corner of the room is any climaxing any

70
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:55,580

73
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:21,600
Fantasy XI, Rekacon and all that fun stuff and all sorts of interesting things and maybe

74
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,060
some sexy things too.

75
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,300
Of course when I'm here.

76
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,060
Also tonight a very special cage match, we're going to change the rules tonight, we're not

77
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,460
going to do what we've done in the past, and I'll tell you why when we come back. No web

78
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,620
cam tonight kids, sorry, but Loki has bought a new computer, which I'm sure he'll talk

79
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,340
about a little later in the show, and because of that upgrade he hasn't had time to set

80
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:47,420
up the cam, so we don't have a cam tonight, which is a good thing because we are all naked

81
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:51,980
right now. Very naked. And I have to say, you have such nice breasts, Pixie Dust, you

82
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:58,500
have very lovely breasts. Thank you. You're very welcome. And plants. Alright, we're going

83
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,420
to start this off, we're going to take a quick break with some music from Dancing Stage Fever,

84
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:06,180
the new game that came out in Europe not too long ago, some classic songs in there. You

85
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,540
may have heard some of these tunes before, but now if you're in Europe or you have a

86
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:16,540
way of playing Dancing Stage Fever. You can play these songs. We'll be back.

87
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:50,300
Okay, we're going to have to cam that, I don't know what's going on, it's stopping going

88
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,860
there, so let's see here.

89
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,340
What I'll do is I'll copy the files over real fast, we'll do it a different way.

90
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,980
Something weird's running with the network right now.

91
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:02,500
In the meantime, Pasty Dust will do her 900 operator impersonation for you.

92
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,980
Ring, ring, ring, ring.

93
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,980
Hello.

94
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,980
Hi.

95
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,940
What's your name, little boy?

96
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:14,060
My name is, um, uh, Loki.

97
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,380
What are you into, little boy?

98
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,500
Um, I'm into sex and big things.

99
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,820
What kind of big things, Loki?

100
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,380
Breasts.

101
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,540
What do you like about them?

102
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,540
They're bouncy.

103
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,540
You're pathetic.

104
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,540
Get off my line.

105
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,540
Flick!

106
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:36,740
Um, yeah, something weird's going on.

107
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,180
The network's running really slow today, so I'm not able to run things off the network

108
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,180
very well.

109
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,460
Yeah, it's because we have a lot of stuff going through our network right now, so sorry

110
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,460
guys.

111
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:55,860
That's all right, we'll be okay.

112
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,900
If you want to join our chat room and join in the big orgy that's going on in there,

114
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,520
And okay in this break we're going to hear it starting off with Asa Bass with All That

115
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,520
She Wants will be the first song we hear from Dancing Stage Fever and then some more stuff

116
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,580
that you may or may not recognize. So okay now that it's copied over to my drive let's

117
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:29,580
try this again. We'll be right back.

118
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:59,580
When she woke up late in the morning light And the day had just begun

119
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:04,580
She opened up her eyes and thought Oh, what a morning

120
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:09,580
It's not a day for words It's a day for catching time

121
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:16,580
She was lying on the beach and having fun She's going to get you all that she wants

122
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:23,580
All that she wants Is another baby

123
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:37,580
All that she wants Is another baby

124
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:44,580
All that she wants All that she wants

125
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:21,580
Oh, how a journey it rides And it's time to pull up the radio

126
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:31,580
With a billion hearts in common now Oh, how a journey it rides

127
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:37,580
And it started from the radio With a billion hearts you wouldn't know

128
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,580
I'll never be twice

129
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:46,580
Sign along, oh baby

130
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,580
Oh, you're not so brave

131
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:54,580
But you're there with the same hope and terror

132
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:46,220
Guess who just got back today Them wild night boys that had been away

133
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:52,020
Haven't changed had much to say But man, I still think them cats are great

134
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:57,020
They were asking if you were around How you was, where you could be found

135
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:03,020
Told them you were living downtown Driving all the old men crazy

136
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:08,020
The boys are back in town, boys are back in town

137
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:15,020
I said, boys are back in town, boys are back in town

138
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,700
Boys are back in town Boys are back in town

139
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,020
Boys are back in town Boys are back in town

140
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,460
Boys are back in town again

141
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:58,360
And hang it down at Nemo's The boss will take us down again

142
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,700
Hi this is Mel B of RTF and for an extra $1.99 a minute my girlfriend Mel B can join us on

143
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:38,880
You guys have played karaoke revolution yet once you guys unlock the song one week

144
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,380
We haven't done it here yet because I've been lazy and I haven't played karaoke revolution all week

145
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:47,760
But once you unlock the song one week, apparently you get a video with it and in that video Mel makes a cameo

146
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:53,360
He's I guess it's all these different people singing the song or something like that and he's in it. So

147
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,700
Be on the lookout for that. Yes angel. Um, actually my friends

148
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:07,180
his friend is actually in the game. He actually did voice for the game. His name is Bert.

149
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,860
I only know his first name. Do you know what he sang in it? The Eagle Eye Cherry Song.

150
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:16,180
The what? Oh, Safe Tonight? Hey, I can get a good squaw on that one. Maybe because Bert's

151
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:20,460
helping you see. Maybe if we get bored the last segment we could fire up Karaoke Revolution

152
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,880
and see who's an all-star here. Because I haven't seen it yet. Maybe. We'll see how

153
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,800
how desperate for material we get. We'll see. Desperate? Who says we're ever desperate?

154
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,800
It's episode 69. We're very, very desperate. Speaking of desperate, hey Andrew, how you

155
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:48,600
doing? Wonderful. I ain't desperate for nothing. Oh, really? How about a good joke? Alright,

156
00:14:48,600 --> 00:15:02,120
In that break we play a bunch of stuff from Dancing Stage Fever, Feces, and in Dancing

157
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:10,360
Stage Faces we have Asa Bass with All That She Wants, Dexi's Midnight Runners with Come

158
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,740
On Eileen, and Thin Lizzy with The Boys Are Back in Town.

159
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:29,460
Maybe later on in the show we'll play some of the less good tracks from it so we'll see.

160
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,960
Even though it's episode number 69, I figured we'd start the show off as we always do with

161
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:38,160
a little bit of how was your day, how was your week.

162
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,800
So let's go around and see how everybody's day and their week was.

163
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,660
I will start tonight because I never started this segment off, so I'm going to start.

164
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:51,720
Yesterday was the one and only, for those of you in NorCal, Recacon, which is a small

165
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,780
convention they did at a community college for anime and video games and all that dorky

166
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,780
fun stuff.

167
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:02,440
They did this at a community college in Pittsburgh, California, which is in the East Bay.

168
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,760
And this was my very first anime convention.

169
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:13,760
pixie dust just had her period right through her pants that is amazing what the hell did

170
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:19,600
you do pixie dust give her a mic give her a mic oh it's definitely sorry the sour sauce

171
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,160
fuck you fuck you fuck you that wasn't even a joke did you catch that he just made another

172
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,480
nun myself so it's not really that great i just looked like it was a painting so it's okay it just

173
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:38,240
It just looked like she got rammed so hard that she's bleeding right now.

174
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,480
What am I going to talk about last night, Rob?

175
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,400
Well, they missed by a long shuck because that's your thigh and nowhere near where it

176
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,720
needs to be.

177
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,160
Well, right here, you know.

178
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,480
Anyway, Rekacon, hello.

179
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,400
I think we have people listening today that actually went to Rekacon yesterday.

180
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,040
So hello to all our new listeners that were at Rekacon yesterday because I hoard out the

181
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,740
the station and business cards and Jahi, bless his little heart, let me get on the mic and

182
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,400
kind of plug things too. So that was very nice of him. Thank you, Jahi. So, what did

183
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,520
you guys think of Rekha Khan? Did you guys have a good time? What kind of stuff did you

184
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,800
guys do? Anything you saw for the first time, got to play for the first time, things like

185
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,400
that? No silent. I just walked around, man. You just walked around? You were just there

186
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:24,720
for the people? That's like me. Yeah, basically that's it. That's like me. There hasn't been

187
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,720
any DDR tournaments in NorCal really lately. There was one a couple weeks ago that I couldn't

188
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,280
go. So this was kind of like a chance for me to see everybody because I haven't seen

189
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,300
them in a long time. So, did you get to play any new interesting games or did you buy anything

190
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:41,280
at the expo or anything like that? Oh, it's completely broke and I thought nothing was

191
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:50,280
necessary. Blah. I have to ask, no milkshakes? No, no milkshakes. Oh, okay. None at all.

192
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:56,280
None at all. What the fuck? Yeah, I find that weird, you know, just everybody comes up to

193
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:04,900
I'm just going to say it, your online personality and your in-life personality are so different.

194
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,620
So, so different, no stylist.

195
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,380
I mean, not that it's a bad thing.

196
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,380
I'm just saying.

197
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,420
Now it looks like I peed on myself since I tried to clean it up.

198
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,420
Fuck!

199
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,820
Why don't you hand the mic off to Angel over there.

200
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,820
Hey, Angel.

201
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,620
Angel, what did you think of Wrecker Hunt?

202
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,620
Sweet.

203
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,980
Did you get to play any new games for the first time or do anything?

204
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:39,420
I got to see the, did somebody just say that Janae had a maxi period?

205
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,420
That was horrible.

206
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,420
Die.

207
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:47,780
You're lucky I know you are, unless I kick your ass, you're sick.

208
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:54,100
Anyway Angel, yesterday, Rekha Khan.

209
00:18:54,100 --> 00:19:00,100
Let's see. God, I almost spelt that away on manga, but, um, I resisted.

210
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,100
It was your poor. I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.

211
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:10,100
Um, not really, but, yeah, I mean, there's better things I should be saving for at the moment, so.

212
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:14,100
Um, yeah. So is life. Excuse me.

213
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,100
That's cool.

214
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,100
Anyway.

215
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,100
Did you meet anybody new yesterday you hadn't met before?

216
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:32,100
Jahi, Mr. Wendell, obviously no stylin, Iwanaki2DX, StaplarX, and a bunch of their friends who came over.

217
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,100
So yeah, that's a lot of people.

218
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:42,100
Okay. Let's see, what about Magus? Magus, what did you think of the 69th Magus? What did you think of the Rekka Khan yesterday?

219
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,100
Rekka Khan was just plain awesome.

220
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,100
And did you get to play anything new for the first time that you haven't played before?

221
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:54,100
I got to play Taiko no Tetsujin. I got to play that new Dragon Quest Slime Morimori Adventure.

222
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,100
Yes, the Dragon Quest with the real sword. That game looked so sweet. I didn't get a chance to play it.

223
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:03,100
It was the most popular thing in the game room and everybody was kind of crowded around it, but it looked really cute.

224
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:08,100
I just wanted to play it, but I love the way the enemies are drawn.

225
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:13,100
They updated all the whole enemies, like the slimes. Well, not just cel-shaded, but they made them look sweet.

226
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,960
I don't know if they did the redone, it looks good, it plays pretty well.

227
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,420
I was kind of surprised though, I was thinking that the Dragon Quest sword game was going

228
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,520
to be just like, somebody had told me, oh it's just the very first Dragon Quest except

229
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,920
you use the sword as a controller.

230
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,500
I was like, well that's kind of weird, but it's actually this whole new original game.

231
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,100
It kind of struck me as like a super scope game to me.

232
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:37,140
It looked a lot like a game you'd be playing with a super scope, where like you'd be shooting

233
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:42,740
the slimes but instead you use the sword.

234
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,740
So that was fun. Good times.

235
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,740
We got to meet a lot of new faces. Basically met everyone that Angel met.

236
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,740
Yep.

237
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,740
We had a good time. We watched some AMVs in the video room.

238
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,740
What were some good music videos you guys saw?

239
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,740
The chibi things that kill.

240
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,740
Uh huh.

241
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:04,740
A complete waste of six minutes and forty-five seconds.

242
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,740
Okay.

243
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:15,460
And this one too, In the Navy, where they started spoofing all these battle cruiser

244
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,460
animes.

245
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,460
Interesting.

246
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,460
Okay.

247
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,460
Cool deal.

248
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:24,140
Um, so yeah, Wreck or Crawl was just, it was great, it was my first convention, I've never

249
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:28,860
been to any kind of anime or geek convention, really, ever, unless you count wacky horror

250
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,260
conventions, those are kind of geeky.

251
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,660
But actually, that's more of like a sex thing, because people get laid at those, except me.

252
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,960
Anyway, but ironically enough, the Rocky Horror Convention was the very first place I ever

253
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,960
played DDR.

254
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,300
Anyway, that was my first non-RockyCon, and good times.

255
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,620
I just like getting to see people.

256
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,260
I don't know much about anime.

257
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,820
I don't really watch a lot of it, admittedly.

258
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:52,180
I'm one of those few DDR players that just... I've seen a couple Miyazaki films and

259
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:57,180
I watched Pokemon back when it was cool, but I haven't really gotten as into anime.

260
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,840
I kind of rely on Jamie for all that.

261
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,860
She's really into anime, and she just kind of tells me what's good and what's not, and

262
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:06,160
And Loki being the hookup also knows some good and not good things.

263
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,800
But I saw a lot of great cosplayers.

264
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
There were some cute cosplayers.

265
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,380
There was a lot of Final Fantasy cosplayers, and I'm always a sucker for anything Final

266
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,380
Fantasy.

267
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,040
And there were some X2 characters.

268
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,300
And there was a whole little group that had like a squall and a yuffie and all this stuff

269
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,300
in it.

270
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,620
It was really cute.

271
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,980
One thing that made me very happy is that there was a Mai.

272
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,100
Somebody came dressed as Mai from Final Fight.

273
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:34,840
me happy.

274
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,840
Link was cool.

275
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,200
Oh yeah, they had not just one, but two people dressed up as Link, which I thought was cool.

276
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,240
They actually had a Link and a Saria.

277
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,440
Later on, after the cosplay, they had karaoke.

278
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:56,360
So we had a guy dressed up as Zelcine invoke rather well, too.

279
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:02,380
And if you've ever been to an anime convention at all, Ramen and Rice had shown up to this

280
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,380
one as well.

281
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,380
Oh my God.

282
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,580
Now people tell me Ramen and Rice are at every single anime convention in the area, so it's

283
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:13,900
kind of like, but this is the first time I saw them, and I was like, they are so cool.

284
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,560
These girls play like everything on their violinists.

285
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,260
I want to get some of their stuff for the station.

286
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,620
I should email, do some emails.

287
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:24,420
I'm a violinist myself, and they're awesome.

288
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:28,420
Oh, I would have thought you were a pianist.

289
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,420
No, but I have one.

290
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,420
Crap.

291
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,420
Be more funny.

292
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,420
Follow your own advice.

293
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:41,420
Anyway, we wound up requesting, like, butterfly and scars of time from people across.

294
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,420
Damn you, damn you.

295
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,420
And you're the one that got them to play butterfly.

296
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,420
Yes, I'm the one that got them to play butterfly.

297
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,420
I hope you die.

298
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,420
I hope you die and you burn in hell.

299
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,420
Just kidding.

300
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,420
It's pretty hot in this room already.

301
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:56,420
Walked right into the pianist's quip, didn't you, Magus?

302
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,100
I would have given my left nut to hear them play Scars of Time.

303
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,740
I'm so sad I didn't stay around for that.

304
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,740
I bet it kicked ass.

305
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,980
Oh, I did and I still have mine.

306
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,180
I did hear them play some stuff from Final Fantasy X, though, which made me all horny

307
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,180
because it was great.

308
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:13,380
Well, uh, see, at the time they played Scars of Time, you hadn't gotten there yet, Mr.

309
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,380
Fashionably Late.

310
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,380
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, bitch.

311
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,380
I'm just kidding.

312
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,380
Love you.

313
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,380
Oh, really?

314
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:25,940
come back an hour later and there he goes, he's still going. He's the man, he's the man.

315
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:31,020
You've got to come up and be on the show sometime. Anyway, so also on How Was My Week, How Was

316
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:38,300
My Day, something worth noting, talking about is this thing that I did on Thursday. I got

317
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:44,100
asked to promote Orange Lounge Radio in a way at this local high school. I judged a

318
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:51,240
local high school's American Idol-style competition, and it was very interesting. I don't know

319
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,240
if anybody from there is listening tonight, probably not because they only mentioned the

320
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,740
station like twice, and I only gave out one business card to the guy who I thought was

321
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,740
most talented out of everybody, mostly because he wrote his own music, and it was fucking

322
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,380
funny. It was something like Adam Sandler would have done, and I'm actually in talks

323
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:10,340
with him right now trying to get a song of his to spin on the show so you guys can see

324
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:17,220
what I'm talking about, but it was very interesting because it was me and two interns from one

325
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,940
of the local Sacramento stations, or I don't know, they work in the promotions department

326
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,420
or something like that, and two teachers.

327
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:28,180
So it was supposed to be like all these local celebrities and I was going to be like the

328
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:33,020
nobody but I ended up being the only one that actually was on a radio program of any kind

329
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,660
so that was kind of interesting.

330
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:39,540
I also ended up being the asshole judge because I was the only one willing to say anything

331
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:44,340
remotely constructive about anybody, because everybody, all the other judges are like,

332
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:48,300
Oh my God, you're so great, you're just like Claire Aiken, you're better than Claire Aiken,

333
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:52,540
oh my God, you should be an American Idol, okay?

334
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,500
You have an awesome voice.

335
00:26:54,500 --> 00:27:00,820
Yeah, and then the one guy was like, you have an awesome voice, you are gonna go far, and

336
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:05,460
then the next person was like, you're gonna go so far, because you have an awesome voice.

337
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,580
And then the next person would come up and go,

338
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:11,020
you have an awesome voice, and it's going to take you very far.

339
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,240
It was the same thing for everybody.

340
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,460
You have an awesome voice, and it's going to take you very far.

341
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,100
If it's going to take you so damn far,

342
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,440
get your ass out of the room.

343
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,020
And then finally, it would come to me, and I'd be all,

344
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,140
you brought your words up on the stage,

345
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:31,020
and that looks really tacky type thing.

346
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,420
And then there was another girl.

347
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,380
This was the one that pissed me off, though.

348
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,620
This was weird because I haven't been back to high school in a long time.

349
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,020
This was the first time I'd kind of...

350
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,420
Shut up.

351
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,020
Shut up.

352
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,500
I graduated in 96.

353
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,500
Fuck you.

354
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,220
I really didn't think so.

355
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,220
Seven years ago.

356
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,220
Bitch.

357
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,220
Yeah.

358
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,220
Yeah.

359
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,220
Yeah.

360
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,220
You thought.

361
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,220
Well, you need to think more next time.

362
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,220
I'm just kidding.

363
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,220
I love you.

364
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,220
I've been a bad girl.

365
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,220
You've been a bad girl.

366
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,220
I'm going to punish you.

367
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,940
I haven't set foot in a high school in a long time and I remembered why.

368
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:08,540
There was this one girl up there who I guess she wasn't that popular or something because

369
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,540
she did her thing.

370
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:12,560
She was singing Hit We With Her Best Shot and she was doing a good job.

371
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,540
I would have liked to have seen her get into it a little more, but she had a lot of courage

372
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,260
to get up there on stage and she was having fun with it.

373
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,860
It looked like she had a lot of fun with it.

374
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:22,860
And of course it goes, and the first person goes, it goes, oh my God, you were really

375
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,860
great.

376
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:28,140
You're just like Kelly Clarkson and you're going to be better than her.

377
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,940
And then the next person got up and goes, you have a totally awesome voice and it's

378
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,900
It's going to take you so far in life.

379
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,540
And then somebody else in the audience goes,

380
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,060
these people in the audience start yelling, liar.

381
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,420
And while it was mildly amusing, I was like, OK, that's

382
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:42,980
fucked up.

383
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,420
And you shouldn't do that when this poor girl's getting up

384
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:49,100
on stage making a fool out of herself for your entertainment.

385
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,740
So the mic got over to me and I said, hey, you know what?

386
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,940
Girl, you've got a lot of balls to get up here on stage

387
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,460
and do that.

388
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,460
And you're going to be able to accomplish a lot of life

389
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,880
unlike some of these people who will

390
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,420
be sitting in the dark forever.

391
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,440
and then the guys in the audience were like,

392
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,980
blah, blah, blah, blah.

393
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:09,600
And the teacher next to me leaned over and said,

394
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,080
thank you for saying that.

395
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,740
And that made me feel good because I hate assholes.

396
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,340
I hate them.

397
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,060
And those people in high school were just like the ones I hated

398
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,900
and would call me fag all the time and stuff.

399
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,300
And they need to like burn in hell because they suck.

400
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,220
I don't care if they were right, Nelly.

401
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,020
It doesn't matter.

402
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,020
That's beside the point.

403
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,820
You're missing the point.

404
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,660
Anyway, that was my week and my day.

405
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,660
Loki, how was your week of your day?

406
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:06,500
downloading off the internet I'm only getting like one kbps so it's like I don't get it

407
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:13,060
so I don't whatever it's fine I guess but it's no got a larger hard drive and I have

408
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:19,740
a computer for my cabinet but I had to go to Fry's a lot this weekend that sucked and

409
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:28,780
yeah that's pretty much it went to that thing that Rob was talking about and that was okay

410
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:34,220
And yeah, I didn't do much.

411
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,660
My week was awesome.

412
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:39,460
It will take me far in life.

413
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,900
Yelled at people today.

414
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,700
Mostly Andrew.

415
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:49,180
Yeah, that's about it.

416
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,460
I didn't do much.

417
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,940
OK, let's hear from some of our guests then, Pixie Dust.

418
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,220
I know you got a lot to say.

419
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:55,940
How was your day?

420
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,580
I didn't have my period on my pants.

421
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:00,220
It was Peter Sauer's song, god damn it!

422
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,220
But before that, how was your week? What did you do this week?

423
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,820
I haven't seen you in like two months.

424
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,660
I know! I've been flawed.

425
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,820
It made me sad.

426
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,580
No, I didn't!

427
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,620
I made you relieved that you didn't have to pull up with me.

428
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,340
Oh, shut up.

429
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,580
Well, how was your week? What did you do?

430
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,900
What did I do this week?

431
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,020
I fucking don't know!

432
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,420
It just went by!

433
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,420
Or should I say, who did you do this week?

434
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,420
There's this strange guy behind me,

435
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:30,500
Yeah, he's been kissing me all weekend long, so I don't know.

436
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,220
I picked him up off the side of the road.

437
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,220
Did you?

438
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,220
Yeah.

439
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,220
How much did it cost you?

440
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,220
You're pretty cheap.

441
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,220
You're like five cents, right?

442
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:44,940
No, seriously, school work has like, occupied all my time, so I haven't been doing much

443
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,380
of anything except been home on the phone.

444
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:51,780
Have you gotten out to play any Bamani recently or anything?

445
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,780
No.

446
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,940
Now, we haven't had you on the show in a long time.

447
00:31:54,940 --> 00:32:05,540
you ever pick up Max 2 for the home? No comment on that. Oh, I see a little bitterness there.

448
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:10,780
I have a little bitterness towards sending someone. And you guys all know. I won't say

449
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:23,200
no more. I don't know, who is it? It's you! You bastard! And basically, this fool came

450
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,300
up to see me. And you went to Rekordkon, yes? And I went to Rekordkon. And I called in sick

451
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:33,820
to work. Shame on you. You called in sick to work to go to Rekordkon? I called in sick

452
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:39,820
to work because Victor came up. Oh, I see. Not to see your asses. Oh, I see how it is.

453
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:44,260
No, we, no. Shut up. Bitch, pass that mic. Just kidding. It's mine now. She almost said

454
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:49,660
what I want. You're an ass. You're an ass, Victor. But yeah, it's been good. I miss you,

455
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:59,520
The chat room was reminding me of a good thing that happened at the con, something kind of

456
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,520
funny.

457
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,720
Richie, EvilMaukie2Dx, one of the folks at Frigous Art Chat Room, he caught on fire!

458
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,720
No, I'm kidding.

459
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,720
He did not.

460
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,720
No, I'm kidding.

461
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,720
God people.

462
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,720
You're gullible.

463
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,720
Look up gullible.

464
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,760
He had this sign that said, I like maids.

465
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:18,240
When I first saw him there at the con, we were all outside, and Richie, I think I saw

466
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:26,340
a maid cosplayer inside and it was just like, boom! Have you ever seen one of those Roadrunner

467
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:39,680
cartoons? That was like Richie. There was a maid cosplayer inside. No one noticed me.

468
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:47,760
I was surprised. They did. A lot of people don't know who you are. They don't know you're

469
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,480
the Orange Lounge. Madam. Yes, I am. I'm the only one with a foot behind my head. That's

470
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,400
all it is. They gave me that. No one noticed me. I guess I was playing the other day. Anything

471
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:10,920
exciting today? Hmm. Cake. And fried Twinkies. Alright. No Stylin. Let's hear from No Stylin.

472
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,000
I know he doesn't talk much in person compared to online, but we'll try to get something

473
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:21,160
I'm two different people from online and real life.

474
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,160
It's okay.

475
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,720
I'm just making this observation.

476
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,720
I would be a little scared if you were kind of bouncing off your walls and changing your

477
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,920
nickname every five seconds like you do on IRC.

478
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,920
That's okay.

479
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,920
Multipersonalities, yeah.

480
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,920
It's all good.

481
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,200
Do you have any shout outs you want to give while you're here?

482
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:42,240
Yeah, Dennis wanted to give a shout out to his homie Maple, I think, from Stockton.

483
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,240
That's it.

484
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:48,240
listen to the show, I don't think, but that's okay. I'm teasing, I'm teasing. I always think

485
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,960
that nobody listens to the show. Well, how was your week? What did you do? Let's see,

486
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:57,960
came up this weekend, met a special person, you know, really cool, nice, lovable, huggable.

487
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:05,560
Oh, just talk about Angel all you want. Okay, I realize it's episode 69 and all, but let's

488
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,560
not make me barf, okay, from all this lovey-dovey chat, because I'm the only single person in

489
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:14,800
this room right now, who's not dating someone else in the room, so I feel really like a

490
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,800
seventh wheel right now.

491
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,800
Okay, I'll tell you this.

492
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,800
What happened?

493
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,800
All right.

494
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:24,500
Coming back from Hollywood video, first time coming to Sacramento and everything, and whoever

495
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:30,480
designs these layouts for these stores and malls, this huge rock, I ran over this rock

496
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,480
and I was clinging in mid-air.

497
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,480
It was hilarious.

498
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,480
We were hovering.

499
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,480
Oh my God, a rock.

500
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:41,480
I was on the passenger side and I was like, what the fuck did you hit? I thought it was

501
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:49,880
a fire hydrant. Well, that was interesting. But it was like, oh shit. So, that was interesting.

502
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:58,880
Well, I'm taking your time. That's cool. And that's pretty much my day. Or week. Alright.

503
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,440
Angel, how was your week? Hi Rob. Hi, how are you? Good. Didn't your local

504
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,440
Did you get a new Bimani game recently?

505
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,440
Percussion Freaks

506
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,440
Percussion Freaks? No, not Drum Freaks, but Percussion Freaks

507
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,440
Well, it's Drummania, but I mean, it's Drummania

508
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,440
I know, but it's a different name, so that makes it worth talking about

509
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,440
Well, I suppose it's a different name, except for the fact that it still says Drummania on the stupid machine

510
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,440
Have you gotten a chance to play it at all?

511
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,440
No

512
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,440
Oh, well then fuck it, tell us about your week

513
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:35,800
Um, let's see, I pretty much worked all week except for like school on Thursday, which

514
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:40,880
I was sick for, so I didn't go, but that's okay, um, then I just pretty much waited out

515
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:51,400
the rest of the week until I got here, so yay, huh, anyway, I'm gonna be boring now,

516
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,600
boring and monotoned and neh.

517
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,100
That's pie!

518
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,600
Pie!

519
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,100
Yoo, pie.

520
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,100
Mmm.

521
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,500
Pie.

522
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,400
Andrew, the 69th magazine, how was your week?

523
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,600
How was your day?

524
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:15,300
Uh, week, long and hard, like, never mind.

525
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,700
Over.

526
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,600
Over.

527
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:26,400
But I kind of went through the motions of just going to school, yes, I'm making all

528
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:33,160
these terrible puns, and just went to school, went home, went to school, went home, went

529
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:38,160
to school, went home, went to school, went home all week, and finally Saturday rolled

530
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,400
around, went to RecCon, and wee fun.

531
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,840
So the rest of the week with Boring Weekend is just all hyper and happy and shit.

532
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:52,160
If I do the 5, 6, 7, 8 song one more time, I swear to...

533
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,160
Oh shit!

534
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,160
No, not twisted earth!

535
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:10,320
You should see, Nellie, you should see what else I can whistle.

536
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,320
I can blow these lips very well, Millie.

537
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:19,320
He's quite talented at the meat flute.

538
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,320
Have you ever heard the milkshake song, the ghetto milkshake song?

539
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:27,920
Alright, we're going to take a break and when we come back we'll talk about some more Bamani

540
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,120
and I think we will have ourselves a cage match.

541
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,800
But the rules for the cage match tonight are a little bit different.

542
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,320
I'll be in the cage actually dancing topless.

543
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,320
No, so stay tuned for that, because we're going to have ourselves a cage match when we come back.

544
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,320
And we'll talk about a whole bunch of other stuff, too.

545
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,320
This break, we're going to do a segment of a bunch of Mr. T songs, because Mr. T rocks.

546
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,320
And I'm not talking about I pity the fool, but I'm talking about

547
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,320
I pity the fool who tastes my gold chain.

548
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,560
about that other Mr. T, the one that we all know from

549
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,560
We'll be back.

550
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,720
So

551
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,720
So

552
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,720
So

553
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,720
So

554
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,720
So

555
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,720
So

556
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,720
So

557
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:09,720
For the step squad of Orange Lounge, this media stops on the phone with the winners at the site PS.

558
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:19,720
GTPO.

559
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:26,520
I mean, all right, we're back and you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 69.

560
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,880
And as promised, we're going to get into a cage match here very shortly, but I thought

561
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,640
this was worth talking about this week.

562
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:35,480
Loki, I know you've been somewhat involved in this.

563
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:41,400
There's been this movement going on lately, MTV is holding this contest, and they are

564
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:46,680
naming the best game of the millennium.

565
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,580
Now of course we're only three years into the millennium, but they're going to name

566
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:52,380
the best game of the whole damn millennium anyway.

567
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,700
Up for nomination, DDR.

568
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:58,220
This is an MTV and electronic gaming monthly.

569
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:01,380
Also up for nomination, Halo.

570
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:04,740
The Final Fantasy series, the Super Mario series, yada yada yada.

571
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:10,180
Loki, tell us more about what's been going on trying to flood the channels with votes

572
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,180
for DDR.

573
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:13,940
That's really stupid.

574
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:20,100
MTV is, you know, they're really genius and they allowed people to vote more than once

575
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:25,620
for their game. So obviously that opens it up for, hey, let's make a script and I'm going

576
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:29,740
to go ahead and vote for my game millions of times. And so that's what everyone did,

577
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:36,040
at least the people that are voting for Halo and DDR. So this went on for like two days

578
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:39,580
and then finally MTV closed their polls and they're like, okay, find out the results on

579
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:45,820
January 2nd. Okay, so that, we thought, okay, they're done. So, pretty much, you know, Halo

580
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:50,180
and DDR are going to win, you know, according to that. And DDR was in the lead. Then for

581
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:53,300
some reason, people thought you could still vote after the polls closed. So, they kept

582
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:58,420
doing it and doing it and doing it. And finally, they opened the polls again, supposedly changing

583
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:03,900
their script or their, like, webpage or whatever, their submission thing, so that you can't,

584
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:08,740
you know, do this multiple voting thing. Yet, it's still getting through. So, to be honest,

585
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,960
I don't know what they're doing and I just don't care anymore.

586
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,480
I was doing it in the beginning, you know, helping out, but now I just don't care.

587
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,480
It's stupid.

588
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,720
Well, if you want to help out, you can go over to MTV.com and do the votes that way,

589
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:24,240
or you can keep an eye on DDR Freak because the admin of DDR Freak, J-Dog, has been writing

590
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,000
several scripts to kind of auto-vote.

591
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,760
So if you want to, you know, help DDR out and make it the number one game, go ahead

592
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,760
and do it.

593
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:36,460
But, you know, I could give a shit because MTV polls suck.

594
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,500
I have seen this exact same thing happen before, exact same thing.

595
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:45,200
An artist I really like a lot was up one year as a nominee for the MTV Viewer's Choice Awards,

596
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,300
and they did voting online, same way.

597
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,840
But this time you could see the results as you were voting.

598
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:54,860
And somebody wrote on the web board for this particular artist, somebody wrote a script

599
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:55,860
that would auto-vote.

600
00:46:55,860 --> 00:47:00,740
It wasn't like a program, but it was a web page that would refresh like 10 frames over

601
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,660
and over again with the voting page.

602
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:06,900
So we had this artist up to 98% of the vote for the Viewer's Choice Award.

603
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:12,220
And the day of the MTV Awards, they posted a message on there that said, well, this person

604
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:15,500
won the web vote, but we're only going to count the phone votes for the real award.

605
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,800
So stay tuned tonight and see who wins, and a completely different person won.

606
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,300
So MTV, you know what, if they want to just throw out the web votes, they'll do it.

607
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:26,500
And what they're going to do is they're going to keep all of the advertising dollars for

608
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,740
all those banners that loaded.

609
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:32,100
Because think of it, every time you refresh that page, that's like three more banners

610
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:36,180
average because MTV.com is full of logos, three more banners that load. So you vote

611
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:42,860
a million times, you're giving MTV a thousand dollars from all that refreshing. So, kind

612
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:46,820
of something to think about. At least that's the way I look at it. You have something to

613
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:52,980
say, Pixie? Well, you wanted something more pathetic than that? The search for Miss Applebottom

614
00:47:52,980 --> 00:48:00,740
on VH1, where they're searching for the woman with the perfect butt. And the choice host

615
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:07,740
of that? J-Lo? Nelly. This Nelly? Not this Nelly. Nelly with the bandaid on his eye.

616
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:13,720
It's getting hot in here. It's so pathetic, there was nothing but big booty black girls

617
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:20,720
and adult models there. I would have thought J-Lo would have been a judge on that show.

618
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:30,220
She has the queen of all butts. I have the king, she has the queen. I have a king-sized

619
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:37,580
are you the flying duchess yes because it's so wide i'm like i like sarah ferguson i have

620
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:45,020
like a wide ass yeah i like how you throw that unlike sarah ferguson well you know what's

621
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:49,300
weird is that they're going to be doing that partridge family redo pretty soon too i mean

622
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:56,540
mtv aren't you in that vh1 is a network i'll watch occasionally because they actually play

623
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:02,160
some good videos. This is how I know I'm getting old, because I prefer VH1 to MTV. The music

624
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,980
on MTV I don't like, as much as I like the music on VH1. It's like, oh God, am I getting

625
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:11,280
old? Because I prefer the station that plays things that skew a little bit older, like

626
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,000
Sting and Coldplay and- Sarah McLachlan.

627
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,720
Sarah McLachlan, and bands that don't play on MTV a lot. I'm like, am I getting old?

628
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:23,180
So this is one reason I don't care about the MTV poll, is that I don't watch MTV, so I

629
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:57,180
Are you willing to bet that Grand Theft Auto Vice City wins, no matter what?

630
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:01,180
That's the thing, because it's trendy to like a Grand Theft Auto Vice City,

631
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:07,180
and it would be like avant-garde for MTV to give the award, because we're going to give the award to a controversial game

632
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:11,180
where you shoot hookers, where you fuck the women and then blow their heads off.

633
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:15,180
That's going to be the best game of the millennium. That sums up 2003 right there.

634
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:19,180
Grand Theft Auto III.

635
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,180
It's just going to be summary targeted.

636
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:25,180
I just don't like MTV.

637
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:30,180
Well, there you have it. There is that poll and it exists if you want to go vote in it.

638
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:32,180
You know, it would be nice to see DDR win something.

639
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:34,180
But I think people out there are thinking that,

640
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:40,180
Oh my gods! If DDR wins this poll and we get exposure on MTV, the Konami is going to make a new mix.

641
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:41,180
6.

642
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:49,940
Okay, the exposure of DDR to anybody on MTV was that stupid fucking Wade Robson commercial.

643
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:51,580
That's all they fucking know.

644
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:55,700
All they know is Afro Man and fucking all his stupid shit like, oh you have to go up

645
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:58,540
and do it and to the side.

646
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:01,180
I'm like, I don't want DDR on MTV.

647
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:03,020
I don't want those people playing my game.

648
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,520
Stay off my dance pad.

649
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,520
Get off.

650
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,380
I like those little girls that come in.

651
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:12,380
The new thing is going to be karaoke revolution.

652
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:14,180
Goody fucking goody.

653
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,940
No styling has something he wants to say?

654
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,020
No.

655
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:24,660
Well, don't tease me like that.

656
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:26,260
Oh, but Rob, you love to be teased.

657
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:28,780
I do like to be teased.

658
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,780
We'll talk a little more about karaoke revolution

659
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:33,620
and things like that after this cage match we're going to have.

660
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:36,700
Now, as I promised, tonight is a little different of a cage

661
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:43,700
match and because it's a different cage match we have different music.

662
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:49,700
So tonight we are having what's called a reverse cage match. The reason why we are having a

663
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:55,580
reverse cage match tonight is because Jamie left for Alabama and assumed that her song

664
00:51:55,580 --> 00:52:02,580
would win for two more weeks and forgot to give me two more songs for cage match. Or

665
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:05,580
Or if she told me, I forgot, and it's my bad.

666
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:10,580
So what we've decided we do tonight is we table the cage match, because we all know Loki's song probably would have won again anyway,

667
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:14,580
because he won last week with Battle Without Honor or Humanity, the 88 severed lens mix,

668
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:17,580
which we'll play later in the show for those who...

669
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:19,580
Oh shit, no I don't.

670
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:23,580
I guess we won't be playing it later in the show, because I don't have the MP3 of it.

671
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:26,580
Oh my God, it's a cheeseburger!

672
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:30,580
Anyway, I guess I can't play because I don't have the MP3 of it,

673
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:36,580
Unless somebody in the chat room I send it to can send it back to me, because it was on Loki's old computer, which is not operative right now.

674
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:41,580
Anyway, tonight in the reverse cage match, this is what's going to happen.

675
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:49,580
Loki and I between, we're each going to put in two songs that we believe are some of the worst things we've ever heard.

676
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:53,580
And they're going to be Bamani or Dance Mania related in some way.

677
00:52:53,580 --> 00:53:02,580
And you guys will vote for the absolute worst song that you heard, and the loser will be banned from Orange Lounge Radio indefinitely.

678
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:08,580
You will never hear this song on the station ever again. Ever. We will ban the song. It's gone.

679
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:14,580
Alright, so Lucky and I are going to pick two songs each, so you're going to vote for the song you hate the most.

680
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:19,580
The song you want to leave tonight. Alright, so that's the reverse cage match.

681
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:24,580
instead of picking a song to win and be in rotation all week long, you're going to pick for a song to lose and be banned indefinitely.

682
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:31,580
Alright, so first up is going to be my first pick, and it's actually a song from Dancing Stage Fever.

683
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:37,580
How exciting. This is a song that you can actually dance to in Dancing Stage Fever, so even if it gets banned from the station indefinitely,

684
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:41,580
you'll still be able to play it if you really, really want to.

685
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:48,580
Here's my pick for tonight's reverse cage match to ban from the station. It's the Spice Girls with Wannabe. Enjoy.

686
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:51,460
You'll tell me what you want, what I really really want

687
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:53,180
No, tell me what you really really want

688
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:55,320
I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want

689
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,200
No, tell me what you want, what you really really want

690
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,260
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna

691
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:01,620
I'm gonna really really really wanna

692
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:02,580
So you say ahhh

693
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:06,140
If you want my future, forget my past

694
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:10,880
If you wanna get with me, we'll be making ministry

695
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:15,240
Now don't go wasting, my precious time

696
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:20,240
Sean, get your actually every week to be just fine

697
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,240
I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want

698
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,240
Don't tell me what you want, what you really really want

699
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:29,240
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna Really really really wanna do the thing

700
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:33,240
If you wanna be my lover You gotta have with my friends

701
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:38,240
Making life forever Friendship never ends

702
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:42,240
If you wanna be my lover You have got to give

703
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:46,420
Taking it too easy but that's the way it is

704
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:48,620
If you wanna be my lover

705
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:50,940
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta

706
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:52,840
Make the last word for the Lord

707
00:54:52,840 --> 00:55:04,840
Come you body down and wind it all around

708
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:15,360
If you want to be my lover

709
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:22,600
Alright though, song number one in tonight's reverse cage match for worst song ever to

710
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,840
be banned from the station was Spice Girls with Wannabe.

711
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:29,000
Let's go around and see what people thought of that and rate it on a scale of one to ten.

712
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Pixie Dust.

713
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:46,000
All I gotta say is, I have ScarySpy's hair, so I love that song. Damn it. Reminds me of my youth, you fuckface. Damn it! Fuck you, I want that song.

714
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
It's my favorite song, so a one.

715
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Well, if you give it a one, that means you think it's bad.

716
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Oh, I gave it a ten!

717
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Alright.

718
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I thought we were doing it in reverse.

719
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Okay.

720
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I thought you were doing it in reverse.

721
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,600
said that he'd like to bang about three out of five of them, but he'd rather they keep

722
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,000
the dick in their mouth so he doesn't have to hear them.

723
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Zero!

724
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Bum-bye!

725
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Alright.

726
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Rob Zink?

727
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Uh, no.

728
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Oh!

729
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,680
It's a Zink for him, not for me.

730
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:14,080
My vote is be glad it wasn't spice up your life, okay?

731
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,080
I know that whole song.

732
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,320
So I give it a two.

733
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,520
I know that whole song, and I love that whole song.

734
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,520
Up next, Loki, your first pick, because we're each putting in two songs tonight because

735
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,000
Jamie's not here, so we're going to have four songs to pick from.

736
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Uh, Loki, what's your first song tonight that you're going to nominate to be banned from Orange Lounge forever?

737
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
This song is like the worst song ever. You guys seem to like it, so you know what? I hope it's gone.

738
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Leave. It's done. This is lame.

739
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I give you fucking Holic. Vote for Holic, you bitch! You fucking bitch and whiny, you can't vote for Holic. Vote for it now!

00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,280
This is Tack with Holik.

Alright, that was song number two to be voted for eviction from Orange Lodge Radio tonight.

Alright.

755
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:06,760
One!

756
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:07,760
Cause it sucks.

757
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,760
It's the same damn song over and over again.

758
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:15,760
He thought he was all cool by his, you know, doing it in seven, four, you know, measures,

759
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:16,760
whatever.

760
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:17,760
Sucks.

761
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:18,760
Lame.

762
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:21,760
Lame song sounds like every single other song is done.

763
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:22,760
Alright.

764
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:30,440
I give it a nine because I just not going to give it a ten because I'm just that big

765
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:33,240
of a prank.

766
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:36,880
Song number three tonight is my pick and it's a Dance Mania pick.

767
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:43,600
This comes from Dance Mania EX1 and it's a cover song and it's a cover of a song that

768
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:48,320
was really famous because it was in a movie once and the name of the group that covers

769
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:54,400
it is called Bushida, and this is their cover of My Heart Will Go On. My pick for tonight

770
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,400
If you're done with the station, my heart will go on.

771
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,400
Enjoy!

772
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:44,400
In my, in my dreams, I see you, I feel you That's how I want to go on

773
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:53,200
Before I cross the distance, I'll stay deep between my

774
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:59,200
Ears come to shove you along

775
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:14,200
Wherever you are, I believe that the heart is gone

776
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:34,200
No, no, you are from the dark and you're here in my heart and my heart is gone and gone

777
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:51,200
I can touch you sometime, I'll just fall for our time

778
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:58,200
And I won't let you be with me, I won't let you be with me

779
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:31,200
It's covered of Blaine Dion. It needs to fucking DIE, BASTARD!

780
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:36,200
I hate Blaine Dion, so that gets a zero on my list.

781
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,200
Alright, Angel.

782
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:41,200
No, DIE, one.

783
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,200
No, Skylin.

784
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:49,200
I give it a zero. 0.1, I don't like this song at all.

785
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:53,200
Alright, Magus Zero. Goodbye.

786
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,200
Uh, Loki.

787
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:58,200
It gets a 10 because that movie was so sad.

788
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:06,200
Oh my god, he's so gone and she's so sad because her love died and became a popsicle.

789
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,200
I'm so alone!

790
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,200
I am the world's greatest singer.

791
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:23,200
And I give my song a ten because I have six crannies and you have none.

792
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,200
Because I have the words, great to see none.

793
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,200
Next thing you know, Celine Dion Hot Pockets.

794
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,200
Alright.

795
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,200
Loki, the final pick in tonight's reverse cage match.

796
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,200
For song to be banned from Orange Lounge forever.

797
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,200
What did you pick?

798
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:39,200
No, they saved my other song from being put in here because it probably would have gotten

799
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:42,200
put off but now you get to be subjected to it even more.

800
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:48,200
The song I was going to pick was Eddie Murphy's Party All the Time, but we like that song.

801
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:54,200
So instead, we've got Nancy and the Boys, a wonderful speed group who sucks because

802
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:57,200
it's speed music, doing Complicated.

803
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,200
So eat this.

804
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:03,200
Alright, from Speed 10, this is Nancy and the Boys with Complicated.

805
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,200
Enjoy.

806
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,200
I can't wait to see you again

807
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,200
I can't wait to see you again

808
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,200
Chill out, watch the young poor

809
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,200
Lay back, all the time you poor

810
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,200
And if you could only let it be

811
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,200
You'll see

812
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,200
I like you the way you are

813
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:46,200
When we're sliding in your car

814
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,200
And you're talking to me one-on-one

815
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:49,200
You've got somebody else

816
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,200
Everyone else

817
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,200
Watch them back, you can laugh

818
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,200
Try and fool, look like fool to me

819
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,200
Tell me

820
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,200
What you're gonna get

821
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,200
So complicated

822
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,200
I see the way you're acting

823
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,200
I'm somebody else, get me frustrated

824
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,200
I'm not just used to you

825
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,200
And you're all in your club

826
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,200
And you're great

827
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,200
And you take care

828
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,200
And you start hating too

829
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,200
No, no, no

830
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,200
You come over, I know

831
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,200
Check out, like yourself, I know

832
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,200
Where you are and where it's at, you see

833
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,200
You make me laugh out, rain looks like a pro

834
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,200
Take off all your crappy clothes

835
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,200
You know what I'm doing

836
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,200
And you want the music

837
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:18,200
Come on, come on now

838
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,200
Everyone else, watch them back

839
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,200
You can laugh, smile and cool

840
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:22,200
You look like a fool to me

841
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:23,200
Tell me what you know

842
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,200
This ain't something I can tell you

843
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,200
I hate it all when you're acting like nobody else

844
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,200
Get me frustrated

845
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,200
I trust this you

846
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,200
And you fall and you fall and you break

847
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,200
And you say what you get and you say it

848
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:22,120
Oh my God, I'm so glad we did this tonight.

849
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:25,760
The chat room reactions to these songs are fucking priceless.

850
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:26,760
This is great.

851
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:29,260
We've got to do this again.

852
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:33,260
Which classic lines is, she sounds like a meth addict?

853
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:36,260
How are you doing, Andrew?

854
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:40,260
Oh, would you say, Loki, play it again?

855
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:42,260
Oh, play it again. No.

856
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:46,260
All right, your thoughts, Nancy and the boys, complicated, speed 10.

857
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:47,260
What do you think, Pixie Dust?

858
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:51,260
I heard that when I was over at Garrett's house when he first got speed 10.

859
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:55,260
We just rolled on the floor laughing from that crap.

860
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:59,260
It's, unfortunately, better than Avril, but, you know.

861
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:02,260
Zero. Zero.

862
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:05,260
Alright, that's 7-1-10, she gives it a zero.

863
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:10,260
Angel, your thoughts on Nancy and the boys? Complicated.

864
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:16,260
Who the fuck either turned up or changed the speed on the record player to where it's like,

865
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:25,260
Who scratched my Avril Lavigne CD? I mean, mine? Um, maybe it was Bixby's.

866
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:32,260
Fuck you! I don't have Avril! I have fucking Nancy and the boys, get it right, bitch!

867
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:35,260
Mmmm, no.

868
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:37,260
Let's go one to ten, Angel.

869
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:38,260
Oh yeah, right.

870
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:40,260
One being low and ten being high.

871
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:42,260
One, bitch!

872
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:44,260
No Stalin, your thoughts on Nancy and the boys?

873
01:08:44,260 --> 01:09:11,380
I give this song a 10 and I'm telling you why, I almost peed my pants laughing at the

874
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:14,900
chat room reactions during that song, and that is worth something.

875
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:20,060
Let's see, Rob, you almost peed your pants in Megas or you're supposed to die?

876
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:22,580
And I almost peed my pants on a dead Megas, so what?

877
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:25,740
That could be a fetish film.

878
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:27,660
Alright, here are your choices.

879
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:29,820
Remember tonight is a reverse cage match.

880
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:34,180
The song that wins, quote unquote, if we can call it that, will be banned from Orange Lounge

881
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:36,380
for all eternity.

882
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,380
Here we go.

883
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:38,420
Here's a recap.

884
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:40,880
You vote for the song you want to ban.

885
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:53,280
Here we go, Spice Girls with Wannabe, choice number one.

886
01:09:53,280 --> 01:10:04,880
Song number two you can vote for tonight is kind of surprising, but it's Tack with Hollick.

887
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:15,840
All right, song number two you can vote for tonight is from Dance Mia X1.

888
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:20,000
It's a cover of Celine Dion with My Heart Will Go On.

889
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:39,720
Song number 4 you can vote for tonight from Speed 10 Nancy and the Boys with Complicated

890
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:54,080
Alright, there you go, please vote now, those votes come with a private message to me, Sky,

891
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:55,080
in the chatroom.

892
01:10:55,080 --> 01:11:02,240
Alright, oh wow, I'm loving the reactions, they're like, no, don't do the recaps, don't

893
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:05,720
play them again, please, for the love of God, alright, we'll tally those votes momentarily.

894
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:10,000
No, you had an interesting opinion on Nancy and the Boys' Complicated.

895
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,000
I loved it.

896
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
It's beautiful.

897
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,440
Why did you love it and think it's beautiful?

898
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:16,320
Because it's funny.

899
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,800
It sounds like the Chipmunks.

900
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:21,000
Yeah, why do people buy Chipmunks albums?

901
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
This is what I want to know.

902
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,240
The Chipmunks, maybe were funny in the 50s, but they're not funny now.

903
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:30,160
Because they're only two bucks.

904
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:32,160
It's cheap entertainment like you, Rob.

905
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:39,160
Because all you have to do is slow down the song and it's the real song.

906
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:47,920
Nancy and the boys should die of chlamydia from what I understand.

907
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:51,560
A song can't die of chlamydia, AIDS maybe, but not chlamydia.

908
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:52,560
You know what?

909
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,400
We should send them to elephant bar and they can die of hepatitis.

910
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:58,520
Hey, if there's a tie tonight, you guys, we'll kick both songs off.

911
01:11:58,520 --> 01:11:59,520
How's that sound?

912
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:11,520
There's a tie tonight. Guess what other song gets booted off? I think I see some votes

913
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:16,180
coming in for Holiks, so you never know. My Holiks could win, we'll see. And that Jamie

914
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:20,000
is going to be a pissed off woman if she hears the Holiks got banned from the station. She's

915
01:12:50,000 --> 01:13:08,880
time magazine has named as game of the year for 2003 karaoke revolution. Why? Why? What

916
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:12,680
do you guys think? I'd like to hear Loki's thoughts on karaoke revolution having played

917
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:42,240
this? Do you think it's possibly because it's innovative and people like these innovative

918
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:44,640
games and they think it's going to start a revolution?

919
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:49,240
Isn't that innovative? Oh yeah, karaoke was just invented by Konami!

920
01:13:49,240 --> 01:14:00,240
But what about the iToy? I think the iToy is way more innovative than karaoke revolution.

921
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:05,280
Yeah, but you can't sing with poorly recorded cover artists.

922
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:08,200
Hey, one of those poorly recorded cover artists is one of Angel's friends.

923
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:10,200
And a point.

924
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,200
Asshole!

925
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,200
God!

926
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,200
Two bucks.

927
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:17,200
Alright.

928
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,200
Not like me.

929
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:22,200
So, so Time magazine names karaoke revolution...

930
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,200
Max 2?

931
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:26,200
Never got named game of the anything.

932
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:27,200
Ultra Mix?

933
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,200
Won't get named game of the anything.

934
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:32,200
DER's just getting shit on left and right.

935
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,200
It may win MTV's poll.

936
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:35,200
Oh goodie.

937
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:39,200
What about Enter the Matrix? That was an awesome game.

938
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:41,200
I don't believe a rat about that one.

939
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:43,200
I guess it was better than the movies, right?

940
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:44,200
I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.

941
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:48,200
It was better than Karaoke Revolution.

942
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:50,200
Karaoke Revolution is kind of retarded.

943
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:54,200
All it is, is you're basically just taking your home console and singing with it.

944
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:58,200
Poorly. Singing poorly with it.

945
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:01,200
That is just me. And a lot of other people.

946
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,280
All you're doing is encouraging them.

947
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,280
God damn it.

948
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:07,720
If there's anything in this world we need, it's encouraging stupid people.

949
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:09,120
Why do we need to encourage them?

950
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:10,120
God damn it.

951
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:14,040
You won't let the stupid Chinese lady just stop asking you for samples.

952
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:16,400
No, you have to go and interject.

953
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,880
You have to go, oh yes, I will take a sample.

954
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,960
We keep the rats out of those.

955
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,680
I will ask them now.

956
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:25,280
And so, these won't stop.

957
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,520
It's the same with this God damn thing.

958
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:33,560
sometimes weren't meant to sing. Just the fact. Just don't sing. And this gives them

959
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:37,840
a false hope that someday they'll become a singing superstar. And in the meantime, they

960
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:46,840
have to torture us with their horrible renditions of crap. Including complicated. Lame. No.

961
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:53,680
Game of the year, I think not. But you seemed to have a good time when you played this game.

962
01:15:53,680 --> 01:16:11,420
game? Oh yeah, great time was had by me, not. Okay. Alright, Pixie Dust. This game encourages

963
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:15,860
my Filipino relatives to go and buy an Xbox and play Karaoke Revolution. Actually, it's

964
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:19,260
on the PS2, dear. Oh, PS2. I thought it was on Xbox, for some reason. No, Xbox is Ultra

965
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:25,260
I bet you anything that Xbox will get a karaoke revolution, if it sells well on PS2.

966
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:31,260
It encourages my aunts to go, oh, that's karaoke, oh shit, ok, we'll go get that, and we'll

967
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:36,260
get some wine and beer and smoke glass and fight cocks all day long.

968
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:37,260
Yeah.

969
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:38,260
Filipino relatives.

970
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:43,260
They say, do you go bite cocks?

971
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:44,260
Fight them.

972
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:45,260
Oh, fight cocks.

973
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:46,260
Cock fighting.

974
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:51,260
What was this kind of blowjob revolution or something like that, you know?

975
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:55,260
Didn't we have a list list like that one week where we were deciding what needs a Bamani game?

976
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:56,260
And I want to say something...

977
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:59,260
Yeah, I want to say Beat Your Meat Mania won that, actually.

978
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:02,260
I think it did.

979
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:07,260
Anyway, who knows what revolution Konami will try to start next.

980
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:11,260
Okay, we're going to take another break here, and when we come back, we'll announce the winner of the cage match.

981
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:13,260
I have to take a break to tally the votes.

982
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:16,620
We have more votes tonight in tonight's cage match than I've ever seen in a cage match

983
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:22,380
ever, which makes me think we need to do a reverse cage match every week.

984
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:23,380
Just kidding.

985
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:24,380
Just kidding.

986
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:25,380
Don't kill me.

987
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:26,380
Don't kill me.

988
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:27,380
Yeah.

989
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:28,380
We'll end up having no songs on the station.

990
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:29,380
I'll just keep voting for Holly.

991
01:17:29,380 --> 01:17:35,540
Also, are we going to get into this add-on crap later?

992
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:36,540
Absolutely.

993
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:39,380
When we come back, we're going to talk a little more about Ultramix, since it is coming out

994
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:41,080
this week after all.

995
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:45,020
In this break, just random potpourri stuff, couple songs from Guitar Freaks and something

996
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:48,860
from DDR that I rather like and I know some of you listening like it too.

997
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:54,500
So enjoy these good songs after that little orgy of bad stuff and we'll be right back.

998
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:58,100
Of course it's all relative, you could hate all three of these songs but, well, sucks

999
01:17:58,100 --> 01:17:59,100
to be you.

1000
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:00,100
We'll be back.

1001
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:15,660
I get an eight-niner to scramble I got my car all set to scramble

1002
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:21,540
Don't really know where I'm from so I put my foot down on the pedal

1003
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:27,540
I got pedal to the metal Rolled down the highway just like a fireball

1004
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:31,540
Climb like the stairs, don't stop the fire, boy, burn it high to the floor

1005
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:36,540
Get those tomatoes, don't stop the fire, boy, burn the sky like it's snow

1006
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:10,540
I'm gonna get it!

1007
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:24,900
I'm going to get it!

1008
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:25,900
It's great, man!

1009
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:32,900
But when she caught his eye, ain't no man could fight those demons

1010
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:39,900
He knew he'd have to try to let love in

1011
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:46,900
Not to let him know, but to try again

1012
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:50,900
But when she caught his eye, ain't no man could fight those demons

1013
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:53,900
He knew he had to try to make love in

1014
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:57,900
Not to let her know, she was in the mood for talking

1015
01:19:57,900 --> 01:20:00,900
So then he began to play the game

1016
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:04,900
Before he knew it, he had told her how much he'd been hurting

1017
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:07,900
How he was hoping she was not the same

1018
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:10,900
Could you see the kind of way people are looking

1019
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:13,900
After all that's trying to be true to love

1020
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:17,900
And she said, boy, you don't have to love no more

1021
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:21,900
I'll give the love you need till you holler in the fair and see

1022
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,900
Like a love boy, I'm a fine lady

1023
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:27,900
You've been hard, so peaceful, but I am the cure

1024
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:30,900
When you wake up late, it's a dream

1025
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:34,900
See, boy, you know she still haunts me, at least

1026
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:37,900
This lady, you know what you found in me

1027
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:40,900
As a lady, I'm the lady that can give you what you need

1028
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:44,900
Baby, I'm a fine lady that will never leave you lonely

1029
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:49,900
Yeah, but maybe this lady will find a baby from the other side, won't she?

1030
01:20:49,900 --> 01:21:15,020
Let's get together, honey, honey, me and you, and do the things, oh, do the things that

1031
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:35,020
we like to do. Oh, do a little dance, make a little love. Get down to life, get down to life. Baby, babe, I need you. Same place, same town.

1032
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:39,020
Well, we can't have all the kids together

1033
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:44,020
And be so on my mind, oh

1034
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:48,020
You and I, baby, look

1035
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:52,020
Get down tonight, get down tonight, baby

1036
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:58,020
Get down, get down, get down, get down, get down tonight, baby

1037
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:35,020
said

1038
01:22:35,380 --> 01:22:37,260

1046
01:22:55,940 --> 01:23:00,800
What do you think should lose and will lose?

1047
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,380
The second song.

1048
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:12,160
You think Holik should lose or will lose?

1049
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:21,500
The Slow One, the Titanic song.

1050
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:23,480
Pixie Dust what do you think will be booted and what should be lost?

1051
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:30,480
You have just got on Jamie's bad side for saying Hollis will be banned, you fucker.

1052
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:33,960
Avril, or Nancy and the Boys.

1053
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:34,960
Will be banned?

1054
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:35,960
Will be banned.

1055
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:37,360
And what should be banned?

1056
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:38,360
What should be banned?

1057
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:39,360
Yeah.

1058
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:40,360
Fucking Titanic song.

1059
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,360
Fucking bitch.

1060
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:47,280
Angel, what song do you think got 79% of the vote tonight?

1061
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,360
Probably the Avril Lavigne cover.

1062
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:50,360
Okay.

1063
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:51,560
And what do you think should be?

1064
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:57,240
you think it's rightfully so either that or the stupid Titanic song sorry all

1065
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:03,040
right Magus what will be booted off tonight what should sadly I think Holick

1066
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:06,720
will go all right you think Holick's gonna go tonight what do you think

1067
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:11,480
should go definitely complicated should have gone but all right I have a

1068
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,480
feeling it's gonna be Holick all right we'll see

1069
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:17,080
Maggie momentarily let me we'll kill you later what should go what do you think

1070
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:21,160
we're not expressing opinion just hard to go because it sucked actually we

1071
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:27,520
to remove alt-hack music from this station? Jamie will stab you for that. If Jamie's listening,

1072
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:35,520
she's going to come back and shove one of those ferrets right up your ass. Great. Alright,

1073
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:44,320
but in all seriousness, what do you think will be voted tonight? Holic? Okay, well I

1074
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,480
I already know who's losing.

1075
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:52,640
And with 79% of the vote, the song you...

1076
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:54,200
I'm sorry, what's going on over there?

1077
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:59,320
They're raping the ferrets, bastards.

1078
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:00,560
Don't play with the ferrets.

1079
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:01,640
Jamie would be upset.

1080
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:02,480
All right.

1081
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:04,680
Yeah, don't play with the ferrets.

1082
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,680
You're going to get beat up when Jamie comes back.

1083
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:07,180
That's all.

1084
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:08,760
And I'm the one who's going to be here,

1085
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:12,360
because two of these bastards live in frickin' the Bay Area.

1086
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:14,280
Bastards.

1087
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:15,280
Alright.

1088
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:16,280
What?

1089
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:17,280
Repeat that.

1090
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,280
Oh, it's the first or step.

1091
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,280
Awesome.

1092
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:21,280
There's the off-step.

1093
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,280
Okay, Rob.

1094
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:23,280
I'll quiet them down.

1095
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:24,280
Alright, yeah.

1096
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:34,280
Would you get those, would you get that, get them all uh, shutting up, please?

1097
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:38,280
Alright, here we go.

1098
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:52,280
Tonight's loser, with 79% of the votes, is Complicated.

1099
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:57,280
It is gone from the station forever.

1100
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:00,280
Hi, guys.

1101
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:02,280
How's my little car screeching noise?

1102
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:04,280
All right.

1103
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:09,520
Okay, so complicated does get the boot from the station and you will never hear it on the station ever again

1104
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:12,120
Even if somebody is trying to play speed 10 in their entirety

1105
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:17,000
They must skip track one because you guys have voted complicated off of the station

1106
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Yeah, I can strip now

1107
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:26,280
So in celebration pixie dust will be getting naked for you all right now. Oh, except the camps down tonight. What a bummer

1108
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:29,320
Where's the music what music? Oh

1109
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:34,280
Oh, I only had, my only stripping song was Complicated, so now I'm...

1110
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:37,440
Rob, you got your... Rob, you got your show yesterday at Rekacon.

1111
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:40,360
Wait, what? You got your show yesterday at Rekacon.

1112
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:44,520
I got... You got my... Oh yeah, I did, I did get a show yesterday at Rekacon.

1113
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:48,560
Arkadian is saying I should delete the file off my computer completely, and I

1114
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,560
think that is a good idea, so...

1115
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:55,120
Here we go, I'm going to, I'm currently going in, here's my DanceMania

1116
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:58,320
Speed 10 directory. I'm going to Complicated,

1117
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:01,900
I'm deleting it. It says do you want to send it through a cycle bin?

1118
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:06,600
And I just like yes, and now I'm minimizing my dose so I can get to the recital bin and here we go

1119
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:08,680
Wait for it. Wait for it. Oh

1120
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:17,480
There went yeah sound that little paper wrecking sound that was it complicated is off my hard drive and gone forever

1121
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:23,280
Gone forever

1122
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:25,280
All right

1123
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:26,280
I know that.

1124
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:29,760
Loki, you had some stuff you wanted to share tonight with DDR Ultramix, since believe it

1125
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:33,720
or not, we are a Bimani related show.

1126
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:36,840
They've already announced what the first song pack is going to be.

1127
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:43,440
It's a bunch of konami originals, starting with DJ Taka with Abyss from Fifth Mix, Naoki

1128
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:50,800
Burning the Floor from Fourth Mix, Tomosuke with Mind Parasite from Dance Maniacs, Mr.

1129
01:28:50,800 --> 01:29:20,760
Alright, that is a little bit of money.

1130
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:52,760
Love Will mixed up with it.

1131
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:55,760
I should, if you want to grab your Fistoff soundtrack, go get it.

1132
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,760
We'll hear it in my eyes in the next break. How's that?

1133
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,760
We'll just save that for the next break.

1134
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:05,760
What do you guys think of this whole...

1135
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:08,760
We've kind of brought this up on the show before, but now that it's coming to light,

1136
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:11,760
and the details are coming out, and the song list is coming out,

1137
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:15,760
what do you guys think of this whole paying $5 to download songs bit?

1138
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:17,760
What do you think of this? Good idea? Bad idea?

1139
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:21,760
I could pay $5 to have sex with Rob. Bad idea.

1140
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:28,760
Haha, you're not funny.

1141
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:33,760
Sucky, sucky $5, me love you long time.

1142
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:35,760
Okay.

1143
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:36,760
I pay you $5 to get away.

1144
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:42,760
What do you think of this idea? Does somebody have a serious comment here, Angel?

1145
01:30:42,760 --> 01:31:01,760
No. We already pay enough for Bemani. If you're like Bemani addicts, like we all are, we already pay enough for getting 2DX in our houses and being able to play that because you have to buy another system for that and all that crap.

1146
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:28,320
Why even bother with Ultravix at all when you can just install Linux on an Xbox and

1147
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:31,160
run StepMania?

1148
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:33,020
Let's assume not everyone knows how to do that.

1149
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:37,920
Not everyone's a nerdy genius like you, I guess.

1150
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:40,260
I use that term extremely loosely.

1151
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:41,260
Kind of like you.

1152
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:42,260
Ha ha ha.

1153
01:31:42,260 --> 01:31:43,260
Just kidding.

1154
01:31:43,260 --> 01:31:45,260
Who's the loose one?

1155
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:46,260
I'm just kidding.

1156
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:47,260
I'm kidding.

1157
01:31:47,260 --> 01:31:48,860
I love you, Janae.

1158
01:31:48,860 --> 01:31:50,780
Pixie dust, don't get pouty with me.

1159
01:31:50,780 --> 01:31:52,660
I'm going to come show you some love, Pixie dust.

1160
01:31:52,660 --> 01:31:53,660
I'm going to show you some love.

1161
01:31:53,660 --> 01:31:54,660
I love you.

1162
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:58,220
I'm going to put my head on your bosom.

1163
01:31:58,220 --> 01:31:59,220
Somebody get the cam.

1164
01:31:59,220 --> 01:32:00,220
I love you.

1165
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:12,000
be? I love you too. I'm so in love. Barrett love. Barrett love. I could put an Xbox on

1166
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:24,760
those tits, man. What? Yeah, it's good shopping. I love you. I love you too. Bastard.

1167
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:30,160
I know you, of all people, love to pay to download things. I want to hear your thoughts

1168
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:40,480
on the $5 for 5 songs bit. It's just $5. I'd just do it. If I had the Xbox version or whatever,

1169
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:47,120
I might download it just so I can rip them. I don't see a problem with paying $5 for 5

1170
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:51,560
songs. It's not that expensive for just a one-time purchase. It's just like an add-on

1171
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:28,000
to buy the game or not. I probably will because we normally buy the game but then I rip the

1172
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,900
songs and play them on my mind. I actually think I would buy the expansion

1173
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:37,000
pack too but the problem is I don't own an Xbox and I still have higher things on my

1174
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:41,320
priority list to get even with DDR coming out. I'm like, I need a new processor for

1175
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:45,800
my computer so I can play Final Fantasy 11. I need a bigger hard drive for my MP3s. I

1176
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:52,760
I need to buy a hooker. You bought me last night Rob. I'm sorry. You're from the 99 cent

1177
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:59,760
hooker store. I can afford that. I'm sorry. She had to raise her prices due to inflation

1178
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:09,520
in the breasts. Not like that mom and that baby huh Rob? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh come on

1179
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:13,820
you're not going to tell them about that? Why don't you tell her? You tell her so much

1180
01:34:13,820 --> 01:34:17,820
No, I won't because now Loki is saying no, so never mind.

1181
01:34:17,820 --> 01:34:19,820
No, don't listen to Loki, I never do.

1182
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:30,820
Well, we were coming out of the grocery store, going back to the car and this mom comes out with the kid in the cart and all of a sudden Loki responds with,

1183
01:34:30,820 --> 01:34:37,820
Oh look, they sold the kid or something and the kid was all happy and whatever. We all busted up laughing.

1184
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:39,820
Alright, Loki wants to correct some things.

1185
01:34:39,820 --> 01:34:41,820
Go ahead, correct it because I don't...

1186
01:34:41,820 --> 01:34:47,580
I saw the stupid woman who looked homely with her stupid baby in her car, pushing her around

1187
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:52,980
picking up cans or whatever, and then I'm like, aw, how cute, she's gonna go sell her

1188
01:34:52,980 --> 01:34:53,980
baby.

1189
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:57,540
And the baby was all happy to be rid of her crack whore mom.

1190
01:34:57,540 --> 01:34:58,540
Alright.

1191
01:34:58,540 --> 01:35:00,980
Okay, um, wow.

1192
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:09,500
What else is going on in the Beaumonti world?

1193
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:13,380
what's going on in the Sim scene? Anything new in the Sim world? Why don't you give us

1194
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:23,660
some of your Sim update of the week? DDR Maniacs, this site came up, yippee. And on ddramerica.com

1195
01:35:23,660 --> 01:35:28,900
or whatever, your BitTorrent site, you can find the wonderful Dancing Stage Fever songs,

1196
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:38,580
which I played today, and they suck. Surprise, surprise. The end. That's it, nothing else

1197
01:35:38,580 --> 01:35:39,580
What's going on?

1198
01:35:39,580 --> 01:35:40,580
Nothing.

1199
01:35:40,580 --> 01:35:41,580
All right.

1200
01:35:41,580 --> 01:35:49,340
We're going to take a quick break, and when we come back, we're going to do the FUs of

1201
01:35:49,340 --> 01:35:50,340
the week.

1202
01:35:50,340 --> 01:35:55,420
So, send those on over to Private Message to Sky in the chat room, and we'll be reading

1203
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:57,700
those right after this quick break.

1204
01:35:57,700 --> 01:36:00,060
And all three of these songs have something in common.

1205
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:05,060
They may have a different artist's name, but they still have something very much in common.

1206
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:06,940
We'll be back.

1207
01:36:06,940 --> 01:36:13,940
off with it in my eyes.

1208
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:39,940
You make me free

1209
01:36:41,940 --> 01:36:47,940
They're the key of the need to live

1210
01:36:48,940 --> 01:36:52,940
You are the light that makes me free

1211
01:36:55,940 --> 01:36:59,940
They're not all the energy

1212
01:36:59,940 --> 01:37:01,940
This is the end of the video.

1213
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:03,940
Thank you for watching.

1214
01:37:03,940 --> 01:37:05,940
Please subscribe and like the video.

1215
01:37:35,940 --> 01:37:39,940
I can feel it in the air

1216
01:37:40,940 --> 01:37:47,940
In the air

1217
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:20,940
How could we stop at this moment, and write about what's been already done?

1218
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:24,600
How could we stop at this moment, and write about what's been already done?

1219
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:28,960
How could we stop at this moment, and write about what's been already done?

1220
01:38:30,020 --> 01:38:33,020
How could we stop at this moment, and write about what's been already done?

1221
01:38:34,220 --> 01:38:37,940
How could we stop at this moment, and write about what's been already done?

1222
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:41,120
How could we stop at this moment, and write about what's been already done?

1223
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:45,700
How could we stop at this moment, and write about what's been already done?

1224
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:58,700
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

1225
01:41:58,700 --> 01:42:07,700
Alright, we're back, and it's about time to get in our favorite part of the show, the

1226
01:42:07,700 --> 01:42:11,140
FUs of the Week, but first we want to make a few quick programming announcements.

1227
01:42:11,140 --> 01:42:17,340
Vanilla Sky will not be on tomorrow night because I have to do some other errands and

1228
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:22,260
with work getting busy and all, I can't stay up late so I have to take Angel home tomorrow.

1229
01:42:22,260 --> 01:42:23,260
Yeah.

1230
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:24,260
Loki.

1231
01:42:24,260 --> 01:42:31,540
And unfortunately with my computer being the way it is in the situation I'm in, I'm unfortunately

1232
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:37,860
unable to do a live wire show this week and that kind of sucks too but I didn't plan for

1233
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:42,140
it to be this way and try and make sure it's not, but the computer is kind of up in the

1234
01:42:42,140 --> 01:42:43,860
air right now.

1235
01:42:43,860 --> 01:42:48,180
So instead, Vanilla Sky will be on Wednesday this week, so I'm going to move over to Wednesday

1236
01:42:48,180 --> 01:42:50,620
this week since there won't be a new live wire this week.

1237
01:42:50,620 --> 01:42:55,260
And tomorrow night, if we can get the computer hooked up tomorrow, I don't know, I'll play

1238
01:42:55,260 --> 01:42:58,940
an old episode of live wire in an increased bit rate.

1239
01:42:58,940 --> 01:43:05,700
So it'll be like a higher quality stream, so we'll do that tomorrow for Monday night.

1240
01:43:05,700 --> 01:43:09,920
If we can't get that to happen, we'll re-run an old episode of Vanilla Sky and a new episode

1241
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:11,380
of Vanilla Sky on Wednesday this week.

1242
01:43:11,380 --> 01:43:13,780
Power Up at the Volume, of course, on Tuesday.

1243
01:43:13,780 --> 01:43:14,780
Re-run this week.

1244
01:43:14,780 --> 01:43:15,780
Jamie is still in Alabama.

1245
01:43:15,780 --> 01:43:20,700
She does get back on Tuesday, but we don't expect her to want to walk through the door

1246
01:43:20,700 --> 01:43:23,220
and sign online first thing.

1247
01:43:23,220 --> 01:43:26,380
She's probably going to want to sleep for a little while, so she'll be back next week

1248
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:27,380
though.

1249
01:43:27,380 --> 01:43:28,540
She'll be back Sunday for sure.

1250
01:43:28,540 --> 01:43:32,860
Season 4 of Orange Lawn's radio debuts this Sunday, and the catch was that we were going

1251
01:43:32,860 --> 01:43:39,700
to go MP3 Pro on Sunday, but we'll get into that in the FUs of the week. Which it is now

1252
01:43:39,700 --> 01:43:46,460
time for you guys. Here we go, we are going into the FUs of the week. I have to get a

1253
01:43:46,460 --> 01:43:50,220
little bit old school this week with the FU music because of Loki's computer being down.

1254
01:43:50,220 --> 01:44:06,020
I'm missing a few files, but we'll start it off.

1255
01:44:06,020 --> 01:44:15,180
Jamie this week would like to give a big F.U. to stupid people and us, I don't know, stupid

1256
01:44:15,180 --> 01:44:22,180
drivers and things that are pissing her off in Alabama, and I'm sure she misses all of

1257
01:44:22,620 --> 01:44:29,620
us greatly. So that's Jamie's F-use for tonight, which I am entering on her behalf. Up next

1258
01:44:30,180 --> 01:44:35,180
is Loki with his F-use. And he still has the Christmas speed music, I promise, two weeks

1259
01:44:35,180 --> 01:44:42,180
I wish you would have thought of this when we did the cage match, huh?

1260
01:45:05,180 --> 01:45:12,180
Wait an hour, wait in line for another hour, get a new processor and drive back.

1261
01:45:12,180 --> 01:45:15,180
And then finally I tried my computer and my computer worked.

1262
01:45:15,180 --> 01:45:21,180
My old computer, something happened in the motherboard when I was installing it, so that didn't work.

1263
01:45:21,180 --> 01:45:25,180
So I go back to Fry's and go pick up a new motherboard and come back home.

1264
01:45:25,180 --> 01:45:28,180
And yeah, I wasted four hours because of Fry's.

1265
01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:29,180
So Fry's sucks.

1266
01:45:29,180 --> 01:45:33,900
Then there was this guy today when I was driving on the road who was trying to scratch his

1267
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:39,740
ass or something while driving his beat up truck and was like swerving all over the road.

1268
01:45:39,740 --> 01:45:44,100
Like practically like you know just driving in two lanes at once and stuff like that.

1269
01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:46,980
So I hate people and they deserve to die.

1270
01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:51,860
And um another thing was um fucking with people with cell phones because uh your cell phones

1271
01:45:51,860 --> 01:45:54,740
are going to get taken away pretty soon and you're not going to be able to drive in your

1272
01:45:54,740 --> 01:45:56,620
car with your cell phones.

1273
01:45:56,620 --> 01:45:57,620
So guess what?

1274
01:45:57,620 --> 01:45:59,620
You're gonna have to concentrate on the road now, huh?

1275
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:01,620
No!

1276
01:46:01,620 --> 01:46:04,620
Two words, one word, compound, headset.

1277
01:46:04,620 --> 01:46:11,620
So, I just, you know, I hate it, I hate you guys, you know, driving at cell phones, you suck.

1278
01:46:11,620 --> 01:46:12,620
Too small!

1279
01:46:12,620 --> 01:46:17,620
I also hate the old bitch that was driving in front of me that was driving like 35 miles an hour in a 50 mile an hour road.

1280
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:22,620
Uh, you suck and I yelled at you, so, yeah.

1281
01:46:22,620 --> 01:46:26,620
Um, also, fuck you to 107.9, cause they really suck.

1282
01:46:26,620 --> 01:46:32,620
I don't understand why you have to send interns to a stupid competition like that.

1283
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:34,620
They have no opinion whatsoever.

1284
01:46:34,620 --> 01:46:38,620
All they were doing was promoting some god knows whatever concert and I forgot what it was.

1285
01:46:38,620 --> 01:46:39,620
Good job on them.

1286
01:46:39,620 --> 01:46:41,620
Hey, let's do the look.

1287
01:46:41,620 --> 01:46:43,620
Good show sucks ass.

1288
01:46:43,620 --> 01:46:52,620
So anyway, so they suck ass and the fact that they have 107.9 coming to promote their damn show, that's really sad.

1289
01:46:52,620 --> 01:47:01,620
Then not only that, that civic guy had no, you know, comments whatsoever, no constructive comments about these people in the first place, so that sucks.

1290
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:08,620
Ooh. Ooh, cat fight.

1291
01:47:38,620 --> 01:47:40,620
I have to figure that one out.

1292
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:47,620
What the hell is this? This is like some Australian guy singing this.

1293
01:47:53,620 --> 01:47:57,620
Oh, crikey! It's Rudolph! He's going down in history!

1294
01:47:57,620 --> 01:47:59,620
Oh, that's awful!

1295
01:47:59,620 --> 01:48:08,620
I had lots of money this weekend and now it's all gone, more or less.

1296
01:48:08,620 --> 01:48:16,620
I think I'm done for now.

1297
01:48:16,620 --> 01:48:18,620
All right, my turn.

1298
01:48:18,620 --> 01:48:23,140
Of course, we get to hear Lion Suki again, even though we played it in that break, which,

1299
01:48:23,140 --> 01:48:25,380
by the way, was all a Kiriyama, but related things.

1300
01:48:25,380 --> 01:48:31,740
Rick in my eyes, Dancer, Duvall, Lion Suki, all 2DX songs, too.

1301
01:48:31,740 --> 01:48:36,940
My F.U. this week goes to live365.com, the lovely site that hosts our radio station.

1302
01:48:36,940 --> 01:48:41,080
That MP3 Pro live shit was supposed to be rolled out at the end of October, and we're

1303
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:43,140
still waiting for it.

1304
01:48:43,140 --> 01:48:52,140
I was hoping we could have a live MP3 Pro stream starting Sunday, but that ain't gonna happen. Why? Because Live365 can't fucking get things out on time.

1305
01:48:52,140 --> 01:49:00,140
I hope we don't get the plug pulled for ranting on this on Live365, but hey, I'm entitled to my right of speech.

1306
01:49:00,140 --> 01:49:08,140
I'm just a little upset. I'm also upset at them because they're promoting the MP3 Pro thing all over the site when it's supposed to be in beta still.

1307
01:49:08,140 --> 01:49:16,140
It's not supposed to be something that was rolled out to everybody, and I think it's a piss-poor thing to do to roll it out when half the people can't use it, because the live software isn't rolled out yet.

1308
01:49:16,140 --> 01:49:25,140
You guys suck that cock, cock and balls, and I hope you get your shit done soon before I come to wherever you're at and set your building on fire.

1309
01:49:25,140 --> 01:49:27,140
He said come.

1310
01:49:27,140 --> 01:49:28,140
Yeah, I said come.

1311
01:49:28,140 --> 01:49:46,140
Um, let's see, my other FUs of the week go to, um, being single, because being single sucks, and, um, my other FU goes to my job, because as much as I love my job, having to teach two classes at once is going to suck a fat cock, and, oh, I'm going to hug from Janae.

1312
01:49:46,140 --> 01:49:47,140
Aw.

1313
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:50,140
I would hate to do Janae if they're having a vagina, not a penis.

1314
01:50:20,140 --> 01:50:30,140
F.U. goes to loading friends money cause they never pay you back, well ex-friends, never pay you back cause they're bastards.

1315
01:50:30,140 --> 01:50:32,140
Or this person is a bastard.

1316
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:34,140
And yeah, that's one thing.

1317
01:50:34,140 --> 01:50:39,140
F.U. goes to the search for Miss Applebottom cause it fucking sucks.

1318
01:50:39,140 --> 01:50:43,140
Why the fuck are you going to tell Nelly that you can make your twat clap?

1319
01:50:43,140 --> 01:50:46,140
What kind of thing does it have to do?

1320
01:50:46,140 --> 01:50:51,140
What does it have to do with your butt?

1321
01:50:51,140 --> 01:50:53,140
What does that sound like?

1322
01:50:53,140 --> 01:50:55,140
Let me try, hold on.

1323
01:50:55,140 --> 01:51:00,140
All I gotta say, that'd be cool if I could do it in time with like the Addams Family song.

1324
01:51:00,140 --> 01:51:02,140
No, no, no. Crap, crap.

1325
01:51:02,140 --> 01:51:07,140
Um, hi one more fuck you.

1326
01:51:07,140 --> 01:51:09,140
Fuck you to Loki.

1327
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:12,140
I'm going to a fucking good Charlotte concert, you bastard.

1328
01:51:12,140 --> 01:51:14,140
And I'm glad about it.

1329
01:51:14,140 --> 01:51:17,140
Yo, hang out with your 107.9 cronies!

1330
01:51:17,140 --> 01:51:20,140
You're gonna be 106.5 cronies, bitch!

1331
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:23,140
Oh my god! Like, there's a difference.

1332
01:51:23,140 --> 01:51:25,140
There is a difference.

1333
01:51:25,140 --> 01:51:28,140
They don't play Eminem on 107.9.

1334
01:51:28,140 --> 01:51:29,140
Take your hand for it.

1335
01:51:29,140 --> 01:51:31,140
Fucktard!

1336
01:51:32,140 --> 01:51:35,140
I don't know. Angel just said fucktard in my ear.

1337
01:51:35,140 --> 01:51:36,140
Whoa, wait!

1338
01:51:36,140 --> 01:51:37,140
I blame you on it.

1339
01:51:37,140 --> 01:51:41,140
But, I would fuck you, Ghost Nelly, for smacking on my ass.

1340
01:51:41,140 --> 01:51:43,140
And, well, no wait.

1341
01:51:43,140 --> 01:51:54,360
I'm not supposed to but I liked it yeah and yeah fuck having big tits cuz I'm

1342
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:57,200
actually in studio and I can say that with Loki's face change like shut the

1343
01:51:57,200 --> 01:52:03,120

1344
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:08,280

1345
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:10,280
Yeah, shut the fuck up.

1346
01:52:12,280 --> 01:52:14,280
They can hold an Xbox between them, shut up.

1347
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:17,280
Hey, that is so fake.

1348
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:20,280
An Xbox can hold a small country in it, okay?

1349
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:25,280
I did not really mean you could put an Xbox on those boobs.

1350
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:28,280
Controller, maybe. Xbox, no.

1351
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:32,280
Fuck, did I get you to put an Xbox in my car?

1352
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:37,280
I'm done.

1353
01:52:37,280 --> 01:52:48,400
I usually have this huge, long F.U. for Sky, but now I don't have an F.U. except for those

1354
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:51,400
rocks in Sacramento.

1355
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:53,520
Fuck you, rocks.

1356
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:54,520
Rock on.

1357
01:52:54,520 --> 01:53:00,320
All right, Angel, your F.U. is for tonight, Angel.

1358
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:01,800
Stop laughing and rain about something.

1359
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:05,880
This is not a funny part of the show, you are not allowed to laugh.

1360
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:06,880
I see.

1361
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:11,880
Pc Dust is balancing DNL on her boobs, that's why they're stopping right now.

1362
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:16,880
But can you crush the can?

1363
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:21,880
Angel.

1364
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:26,880
Um, thank you to my work for not being able to give us checks on Friday,

1365
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:31,880
but you know, it's a mail thing so...

1366
01:53:31,880 --> 01:54:00,880
I'm not that angsty this week, surprisingly enough.

1367
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:07,880
up?

1368
01:54:09,260 --> 01:54:14,200
uh oh, uh oh, here comes lucky again

1369
01:54:14,200 --> 01:54:20,280
fuck you to the stupid god damn commercials on the radio about some truck

1370
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:24,000
i don't give a fuck if a black hole does not have a hemi

1371
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,300
okay

1372
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:32,040
I swear to God, if I was that person in this fictitious commercial, I would have gutted

1373
01:54:32,040 --> 01:54:33,840
those two people talking.

1374
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:35,840
I hated that commercial because it's so fucking annoying.

1375
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:36,840
Hey, I got a Hemi too!

1376
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:37,840
Look what I can do!

1377
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:38,840
How much is that purple tail?

1378
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:39,840
Does it have a Hemi?

1379
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:40,840
I'm a redneck!

1380
01:54:40,840 --> 01:54:41,840
Who fucks my own cousin?

1381
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:42,840
I hate that fucking commercial.

1382
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:43,840
That's all.

1383
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:44,840
I'm dead.

1384
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:45,840
Magus.

1385
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:50,840
I hate that fucking commercial.

1386
01:54:50,840 --> 01:54:51,840
That's all.

1387
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:52,840
I'm dead.

1388
01:54:52,840 --> 01:54:53,840
Magus.

1389
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:59,840
Alright, this is gonna keep me for most of the day.

1390
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:07,840
F you to the way that the swap room at Rekacon was designed, the way they had the door guards

1391
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:08,840
and shit.

1392
01:55:08,840 --> 01:55:13,160
There was one way in, one way out.

1393
01:55:13,160 --> 01:55:18,840
could not you know go out for like five seconds and go back in the same door

1394
01:55:18,840 --> 01:55:25,200
and go all the way around the building and go back in it's just a pain in the

1395
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:33,040
ass and then they had the long lines at the game room then let's see if you do

1396
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:39,240
traffic good at getting into Pittsburgh for Rekha Khan and F you to fog on the

1397
01:56:09,240 --> 01:56:23,060
All right, sorry. Captain Canada, I'd like to give a nephew to the week. Beer bottle caps

1398
01:56:23,060 --> 01:56:27,360
for being so impossible to open without a bottle opener. And my roommate and myself

1399
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:32,600
for not having bottle opener in our dorm. It took me like 10 minutes and a cut hand

1400
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:35,640
before I finally ripped the cap off with a pair of scissors. It was like sitting on the

1401
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:39,840
pot and then realizing there's no toilet paper.

1402
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:46,800
Wipe your ass with a shower curtain.

1403
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:55,320
Zodiac Knight would like to send a big F.U. to his school, the Illinois Institute of Technology

1404
01:56:55,320 --> 01:56:59,640
for being such money-grubbing whores who continue to not provide for their students.

1405
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:02,640
And if you can't say the school's name on the air, I'll understand.

1406
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:04,640
Oops.

1407
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:07,640
Hi, ZodiacNet, by the way.

1408
01:57:07,640 --> 01:57:10,640
Um, let's see.

1409
01:57:10,640 --> 01:57:16,640
Evil Naoki 2DX would like to say, fuck Seton Medical Center for not telling us that my grandmother suffers from anemia.

1410
01:57:16,640 --> 01:57:22,640
Thanks to those asshats, my grandmother is on life support and I have no fucking idea if she's going to live to see tomorrow.

1411
01:57:52,640 --> 01:57:56,280
Piper Girl would like to say, F you to programming, the C language, pointers and arrays.

1412
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:59,920
Fuck you to my fan club, who seem to show up at the arcade every time I show up and

1413
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:02,000
look like they're watching more than just me playing Initial D.

1414
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,560
They're watching your press, of course.

1415
01:58:03,560 --> 01:58:10,240
F you to stalkers in general, because they're giving ex-C9, C9, M me creepy looks in terms

1416
01:58:10,240 --> 01:58:12,560
of smiling and trying to be friendly when it's creepy as fuck.

1417
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:18,080
And F you to midterms, because of those I haven't been able to go to Orange Lawn's radio.

1418
01:58:18,080 --> 01:58:20,900
And I miss the Orange Lawn's radio crew, so yeah.

1419
01:58:20,900 --> 01:58:26,560
SVI is tuning in from Las Vegas tonight and would like to give an F-You of the week to

1420
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:29,840
the manager of the virtual reality zone of the Adventure Dome at Circus Circus in Las

1421
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:30,840
Vegas.

1422
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:33,800
That was one of the first places I ever played VR.

1423
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:37,840
They don't fix their bimani machines so many locals accuse the workers of being lazy ass

1424
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:40,440
bastards when it's actually the manager who is to be blamed for it.

1425
01:58:40,440 --> 01:58:42,880
F-You to myself for being left out of too much.

1426
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:46,940
I want to get out of Las Vegas so I can be back with my friends back at the RTA crew.

1427
01:59:16,940 --> 01:59:27,940
Fred Phelps, I think, and he's a total ass-hat who's just an attention-horn, that's how he does it by fag-bashing, so that's why we don't like to acknowledge that he exists, because sick people like that don't exist in my world.

1428
01:59:27,940 --> 01:59:34,940
Be sure to tune in to his show, The 700 Club, on the Family Channel.

1429
01:59:34,940 --> 01:59:36,940
Yeah, weekdays at 11.

1430
01:59:36,940 --> 01:59:43,940
700 Club, great material for having friends over and wanting to talk about something.

1431
02:00:13,940 --> 02:00:20,940
If you like this video, please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel.

1432
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:48,860
Nymphs would like to say fuck you to my internet being down last weekend it went out Saturday

1441
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:33,080

That was me!

1443
02:03:36,080 --> 02:03:38,080
Everybody knows that Lance is the hottest.

1444
02:03:38,080 --> 02:03:40,080
Oh my god! No, I'm good!

1445
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:43,080
No, Justin is the hottest because he has solo crew now and he's like so hot!

1446
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:45,080
Oh my god!

1447
02:03:45,080 --> 02:03:47,080
Oh, my whole cheerleading team thinks that.

1448
02:03:47,080 --> 02:03:49,080
Yeah!

1449
02:03:49,080 --> 02:03:51,080
Okay.

1450
02:03:51,080 --> 02:03:54,080
Now that we've thoroughly scared our listeners.

1451
02:03:54,080 --> 02:03:56,080
Like, oh my god!

1452
02:03:56,080 --> 02:03:59,080
I think what we'll do

1453
02:03:59,080 --> 02:04:01,080
is kill ourselves. No.

1454
02:04:01,080 --> 02:04:02,080
Uh, what we're gonna do...

1455
02:04:02,080 --> 02:04:04,080
Oh, awesome!

1456
02:04:04,080 --> 02:04:05,080
Can I join?

1457
02:04:05,080 --> 02:04:08,080
It's like Suicide Club all over again.

1458
02:04:08,080 --> 02:04:09,080
Yes.

1459
02:04:09,080 --> 02:04:12,080
I'm doing that voice the whole night now.

1460
02:04:12,080 --> 02:04:13,080
Yeah.

1461
02:04:13,080 --> 02:04:19,080
Like, I'm going to do this voice the whole night long, because, you know, like, it annoys

1462
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:20,080
people.

1463
02:04:20,080 --> 02:04:22,080
Yeah, this is a ladies' man.

1464
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:26,080
I hope you get your wang hugified.

1465
02:04:26,080 --> 02:04:27,080
The wang?

1466
02:04:27,080 --> 02:04:30,080
The wang, yeah, the wang.

1467
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:31,080
Wang hugified.

1468
02:04:31,080 --> 02:04:32,080
Wang hugified.

1469
02:04:32,080 --> 02:04:33,080

1470
02:04:33,080 --> 02:04:34,080
Yeah.

1471
02:04:34,080 --> 02:04:41,600

1472
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:42,600
ten inches.

1473
02:04:42,600 --> 02:04:52,020
Yeah, that's pretty small.

1474
02:04:52,020 --> 02:04:53,020
Like totally.

1475
02:04:53,020 --> 02:04:57,620
I think we'll try to save this show by taking a quick break.

1476
02:04:57,620 --> 02:05:01,860
And when we come back from the break, some of us are going to show off our shit in Karaoke

1477
02:05:01,860 --> 02:05:02,860
Revolution.

1478
02:05:02,860 --> 02:05:10,620
All right, so we're going to be singing some karaoke revolution and also we're going to

1479
02:05:10,620 --> 02:05:16,320
be doing some Ask Orange Lounge. So send in those questions over private message for Ask

1480
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:19,940
Orange Lounge when we come back. It's going to be a little bit of an extended break because

1481
02:05:19,940 --> 02:05:25,380
we're going to set up some things for karaoke revolution. So we're going to play some songs

1482
02:05:25,380 --> 02:05:29,020

1483
02:05:29,020 --> 02:05:40,580
Maniacs, including Johnny Johnna, Happy Hopper, Twinbee, Quickening, and we'll do In My Dreams,

1484
02:05:40,580 --> 02:05:47,580
because that's one of my favorite Bomani songs ever.

1485
02:07:10,580 --> 02:07:12,580
Now you have to quit the drill

1486
02:07:12,580 --> 02:07:14,580
I don't wanna do it

1487
02:08:12,580 --> 02:08:31,580

1488
02:08:31,580 --> 02:08:41,580
1, 2, 3, 4!

1489
02:09:11,580 --> 02:09:13,580
You don't know

1490
02:09:22,580 --> 02:09:25,580
They want to be the one that they're used to, won't you sing?

1491
02:09:28,580 --> 02:09:30,580
You don't know

1492
02:11:00,580 --> 02:11:24,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

02:11:24,580 --> 02:11:40,580
Oh yeah, yeah

1494
02:11:40,580 --> 02:11:43,580
How can I know what you're thinking?

1495
02:11:43,580 --> 02:11:47,580
How do I know what's going on?

1496
02:11:47,580 --> 02:11:50,580
Don't make it hard to believe in

1497
02:11:50,580 --> 02:11:54,580
Don't make it hard to go on

1498
02:11:54,580 --> 02:11:57,580
Put a little faith in me now

1499
02:11:57,580 --> 02:12:01,580
Put a little trust in me somehow

1500
02:12:01,580 --> 02:12:05,580
Cause when I hold you I'm never bound

1501
02:12:05,580 --> 02:12:08,580
Cause it's all that I feel

1502
02:12:08,580 --> 02:12:11,580
In my dream, but in my dreams

1503
02:12:11,580 --> 02:12:14,580
You and I can do it so great

1504
02:12:14,580 --> 02:12:18,580
But in my heart I can feel

1505
02:12:18,580 --> 02:12:27,580
I wanna make you feel free, I wanna make you feel forever

1506
02:12:27,580 --> 02:12:35,580
Come on, hold me, hold me

02:23:33,020 --> 02:23:37,020
It's strong, it's sudden, it's cruel sometimes

1621
02:23:37,020 --> 02:23:41,020
But it might just save your life

1622
02:23:41,020 --> 02:23:45,020
That's the power of love

1623
02:23:45,020 --> 02:23:49,020
It's the power of love

1624
02:23:49,020 --> 02:23:51,020
Uh, Maggots, I think you need to sing a little louder.

1625
02:23:51,020 --> 02:23:59,020
First time feeling it might make you sad Next time you feel it might make you mad

1626
02:23:59,020 --> 02:24:07,020
Will you be glad, baby, when you're found It's the power to make love around

1627
02:24:07,020 --> 02:24:15,020
Don't take money, don't take fame Don't need no credit card to ride this train

1628
02:24:15,020 --> 02:24:19,020
As strong and as sudden and cruel sometimes

1629
02:24:19,020 --> 02:24:24,020
It might just save your life

1630
02:24:24,020 --> 02:24:29,020
And saving all your love is fair

1631
02:24:29,020 --> 02:24:32,020
Yeah, but you don't care

1632
02:24:32,020 --> 02:24:36,020
You know what to do

1633
02:24:36,020 --> 02:24:40,020
When it gets all of you

1634
02:24:40,020 --> 02:24:48,020
Where the hell I'm bound, you feel the power of love

1635
02:24:48,020 --> 02:24:52,020
You feel the power of love

1636
02:24:52,020 --> 02:24:55,020
Do you feel it?

1637
02:25:00,020 --> 02:25:02,020
I'm really suckin' on this

1638
02:25:04,020 --> 02:25:07,020
It's okay, Magus, you suck all the time

1639
02:25:07,020 --> 02:25:09,020
Shut up! Shut up, Robin!

1640
02:25:09,020 --> 02:25:11,020
Shut up, Robin. I don't suck. You suck.

1641
02:25:11,020 --> 02:25:13,020
Four.

1642
02:25:13,020 --> 02:25:15,020
Stolen.

1643
02:25:15,020 --> 02:25:17,020
Don't take money

1644
02:25:17,020 --> 02:25:19,020
Don't take fame

1645
02:25:19,020 --> 02:25:21,020
Don't need no credit card

1646
02:25:21,020 --> 02:25:23,020
To ride this train

1647
02:25:23,020 --> 02:25:25,020
Coven diamonds

1648
02:25:25,020 --> 02:25:27,020
And from it's steed

1649
02:25:27,020 --> 02:25:29,020
You won't feel nothing

1650
02:25:29,020 --> 02:25:31,020
To feel

1651
02:25:31,020 --> 02:25:33,020
You feel the power

1652
02:25:33,020 --> 02:25:35,020
You feel the power of love

1653
02:25:35,020 --> 02:25:37,020
That's power

1654
02:25:37,020 --> 02:25:41,020

You feel the power of love

1657
02:25:49,020 --> 02:25:55,020
You feel the power of love

1658
02:25:55,020 --> 02:25:57,020
Alright

1659
02:25:57,020 --> 02:26:01,020
Magus got a score of 8,936

1660
02:26:01,020 --> 02:26:03,020
We've been officially saved

1661
02:26:03,020 --> 02:26:04,020
Why?

1662
02:26:04,020 --> 02:26:05,020
Because he's done.

1663
02:26:05,020 --> 02:26:06,020
He's done?

1664
02:26:06,020 --> 02:26:07,020
Oh, okay.

1665
02:26:07,020 --> 02:26:09,020
Not even a gold record.

1666
02:26:09,020 --> 02:26:12,020
I've got a place, so I have a reason.

1667
02:26:12,020 --> 02:26:14,020
Basically, since we're kind of...

1668
02:26:14,020 --> 02:26:16,020
This isn't a popular segment with our chat room.

1669
02:26:16,020 --> 02:26:18,020
I think I got the equivalent of a C.

1670
02:26:18,020 --> 02:26:19,020
I don't know.

1671
02:26:19,020 --> 02:26:20,020
My voice isn't too good today, so...

1672
02:26:20,020 --> 02:26:24,020
We'll let one more person go, and then we'll judge where we're at.

1673
02:26:24,020 --> 02:26:27,020
So, Janae, why don't you pixie dust, why don't you take over.

1674
02:26:27,020 --> 02:26:32,020
And if the chat room says, please Lord, pull the plug, after Janae, we'll stop this segment.

1675
02:26:32,020 --> 02:26:34,020
Otherwise, we're putting Loki on stage.

1676
02:27:02,020 --> 02:27:07,020
She's going to do a little bit of sexy piano loving here from a Pixie Dust.

1677
02:27:07,020 --> 02:27:14,020
Alright, ready? Here she goes. Remember you want to kind of keep the green arrow on the blue bar.

1678
02:27:14,020 --> 02:27:20,020
That's right. You're going to be singing at Central Station.

1679
02:27:20,020 --> 02:27:23,020
Alright, here we go. Loading. This is Pixie Dust with Don't Know Why.

1680
02:27:23,020 --> 02:27:26,180
and chat room you can vote if you want this segment to keep going with Loki singing a

1681
02:27:26,180 --> 02:27:31,180
song or if you want us to end it.

1682
02:27:31,180 --> 02:27:58,180
I'll wait till I've saw the sun I don't know why I love you by the house of

1683
02:27:58,180 --> 02:28:10,180
I don't know why I didn't come I don't know why I didn't come

1684
02:28:10,180 --> 02:28:22,180
When I saw the break of day I wish that I would fly away

1685
02:28:22,180 --> 02:28:36,180
Can't change till you've got me in my hands My heart is dreshed in your eyes

1686
02:28:36,180 --> 02:28:46,180
And you'll be on my mind For all I know

1687
02:28:46,180 --> 02:28:56,180
I'll be on my mind for a little while

1688
02:28:56,180 --> 02:29:01,180
I'll cross the endless sea

1689
02:29:01,180 --> 02:29:06,180
I will die in that sea

1690
02:29:06,180 --> 02:29:11,180
But I'll be right here

1691
02:29:11,180 --> 02:29:16,180
I'm running down the road

1692
02:29:17,180 --> 02:29:22,180
My heart is drenching

1693
02:29:22,180 --> 02:29:26,180
Can I get that one?

1694
02:29:27,180 --> 02:29:38,180
You'll be on my mind forever

1695
02:29:38,180 --> 02:29:45,180
I don't know why I don't know why I don't know why

1696
02:30:08,180 --> 02:30:10,180
I didn't come

1697
02:30:11,180 --> 02:30:15,180
Feeling empty as a drum

1698
02:30:16,180 --> 02:30:20,180
I don't know why I didn't come

1699
02:30:21,180 --> 02:30:25,180
I don't know why I didn't come

1700
02:30:26,180 --> 02:30:32,180
I don't know why I didn't come

1701
02:30:32,180 --> 02:30:47,780
All right, a score of 31,043 points for Pixie Dust. Nice job. And also a platinum. She is

1702
02:30:47,780 --> 02:30:53,620
a superstar. I let you guys vote in the chat room if you wanted to keep this statement

1703
02:30:53,620 --> 02:30:59,300
going because some of you guys were complaining about it. And you voted, Loki has to sing.

1704
02:30:59,300 --> 02:31:11,100
You guys wanted to hear it, so Loki will be singing complicated.

1705
02:31:11,100 --> 02:31:12,740
In the meantime, vote in the chat room.

1706
02:31:12,740 --> 02:31:14,700
Do you want no stylin' to sing?

1707
02:31:14,700 --> 02:31:15,700
No stylin' me?

1708
02:31:15,700 --> 02:31:16,700
Loki, sing the parody.

1709
02:31:16,700 --> 02:31:17,700
Sing the word out.

1710
02:31:17,700 --> 02:31:18,700
No stylin' will be up after Loki.

1711
02:31:18,700 --> 02:31:19,700
I don't want to sing.

1712
02:31:19,700 --> 02:31:20,700
I suck.

1713
02:31:20,700 --> 02:31:21,700
You'll see why.

1714
02:31:21,700 --> 02:31:28,700
I should have just done my live performance as the song that we should have voted off.

1715
02:31:28,700 --> 02:31:30,700
What the hell is happening to this microphone, too?

1716
02:31:30,700 --> 02:31:32,700
It's like all fucked up.

1717
02:31:32,700 --> 02:31:35,700
God damn it, I don't wanna play a song!

1718
02:31:35,700 --> 02:31:38,700
Hey, who told the chat room to vote?

1719
02:31:38,700 --> 02:31:40,700
Oh, we just cycled out of a game.

1720
02:31:40,700 --> 02:31:42,700
Teninga is the winner.

1721
02:31:42,700 --> 02:31:44,700
Teninga is the winner!

1722
02:31:45,700 --> 02:31:47,700
Alright, here we go.

1723
02:31:47,700 --> 02:31:49,700
Going back into a new game.

1724
02:31:49,700 --> 02:31:51,700
And we're gonna play Teninga again.

1725
02:31:51,700 --> 02:31:53,700
Alright, here we go.

1726
02:31:53,700 --> 02:31:55,700
Loki will be singing Complicated.

1727
02:31:55,700 --> 02:32:21,900
And, Loki will be singing at the pit stop, as will the song sound like a pit stop.

1728
02:32:21,900 --> 02:32:23,900
I don't want to do this!

1729
02:32:25,900 --> 02:32:29,900
Dude, I am like a chick on this stage. She is so lame.

1730
02:32:32,900 --> 02:32:40,900
Okay, just so you know chat room, I can't sing. And they're doing this because they hate you. They don't like you.

1731
02:32:40,900 --> 02:32:45,900
I'm feeling sweet

1732
02:32:45,900 --> 02:32:48,900
Chill out, which is all I'm looking for

1733
02:32:48,900 --> 02:32:51,900
Lay back, it's all been done before

1734
02:32:51,900 --> 02:32:55,900
And if you could go on leave, let it be

1735
02:32:55,900 --> 02:32:57,900
You will see

1736
02:32:57,900 --> 02:33:00,900
I like you, you are

1737
02:33:00,900 --> 02:33:03,900
When we're driving in your car

1738
02:33:03,900 --> 02:33:04,900
When we're driving in your car

1739
02:33:04,900 --> 02:33:06,900
When we're driving in your car

1740
02:33:06,900 --> 02:33:17,020
only that's what it said you're watching your back I can't relax you're trying to

1743
02:33:31,220 --> 02:33:36,380
Frustrated, I hate this song you suck fucking ass

1744
02:33:42,080 --> 02:33:48,840
Words words words words more words. I still got a green no no no no no

1745
02:33:50,400 --> 02:33:52,400
You've got

1746
02:33:52,460 --> 02:33:56,140
Announce dressed up like you're something else

1747
02:33:56,140 --> 02:34:02,100
I can't hit the pitch cuz I can't sing where's the crap you're making me do this

1748
02:34:02,540 --> 02:34:10,600
Laugh out when you strike your pose take off all your preppy clothes get naked on the floor

1749
02:34:11,580 --> 02:34:13,580
I

1750
02:34:13,840 --> 02:34:15,900
Hate this somebody else

1751
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:24,260
Watching your back just can't relax. You're trying to be cool. You're looking like a fool to me

1752
02:34:24,260 --> 02:34:30,260
Tell me, why'd you have to make me go and play this fucking game?

1753
02:34:30,260 --> 02:34:34,260
I fucking hate, I see why you're acting like somebody else

1754
02:34:34,260 --> 02:34:37,260
But I can't keep up the words

1755
02:34:37,260 --> 02:34:39,260
Lies like this

1756
02:34:39,260 --> 02:34:42,260
You fall and you crawl and you've been taken

1757
02:34:42,260 --> 02:34:44,260
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

1758
02:34:44,260 --> 02:34:45,260
And there's tough words

1759
02:34:45,260 --> 02:34:47,260
And what's even the stupid thing?

1760
02:34:47,260 --> 02:34:49,260
Hey, why are you walking away?

1761
02:34:49,260 --> 02:34:52,260
Fuck you, get your ass back in this fucking concert!

1762
02:34:54,260 --> 02:34:56,260
No, no, no.

1763
02:34:57,260 --> 02:34:59,260
You suck.

1764
02:35:00,260 --> 02:35:02,260
Bite my ass.

1765
02:35:04,260 --> 02:35:07,260
Chill out, watch it goin' for.

1766
02:35:07,260 --> 02:35:10,260
Lay back, it's all been done before.

1767
02:35:10,260 --> 02:35:14,260
Eat my ass, you could only let it be.

1768
02:35:14,260 --> 02:35:16,260
You'll see.

1769
02:35:16,260 --> 02:35:22,100
I think this segment is really dead. You should stop torturing the chat room now

1770
02:35:22,220 --> 02:35:26,940
You're really trying to be cool looking like a fool to me. I could have told you that

1771
02:35:27,460 --> 02:35:29,460
Tell me

1772
02:35:29,980 --> 02:35:32,700
You know, they're fucking recording this god damn you

1773
02:35:37,500 --> 02:35:40,660
I hate it. I want her to break down cry again

1774
02:35:40,660 --> 02:35:47,660
You'll fail, and you'll crawl, and you'll break, and you'll take, and you'll get, and you'll turn it, blah blah blah blah

1775
02:35:47,660 --> 02:35:51,660
Crowd boost, so fucking take that up your ass

1776
02:35:51,660 --> 02:35:57,660
No, no, why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?

1777
02:35:57,660 --> 02:36:03,660
I see the way you're looking and acting like somebody else gets me frustrated

1778
02:36:03,660 --> 02:36:09,660
Life's like this and that's it, she's failing, she's failing

1779
02:36:09,660 --> 02:36:11,660
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do

1780
02:36:11,660 --> 02:36:13,660
I want to sing to promise me

1781
02:36:13,660 --> 02:36:15,660
I'll never forget

1782
02:36:15,660 --> 02:36:17,660
You

1783
02:36:17,660 --> 02:36:18,660
Fucking

1784
02:36:18,660 --> 02:36:20,660
Suck

1785
02:36:20,660 --> 02:36:22,660
Oooh

1786
02:36:22,660 --> 02:36:24,660
Alright

1787
02:36:24,660 --> 02:36:26,660
A score of

1788
02:36:26,660 --> 02:36:28,660

1789
02:36:28,660 --> 02:36:29,660
For Loki

1790
02:36:29,660 --> 02:36:31,660
Believe it or not, not even a gold record

1791
02:36:31,660 --> 02:36:33,660
Alright

1792
02:36:33,660 --> 02:36:35,660
You guys voted

1793
02:36:35,660 --> 02:36:37,660
If no stylin' should sing or not

1794
02:36:37,660 --> 02:36:41,660
You voted that yes, No Styling needs to get up there to sing.

1795
02:36:41,660 --> 02:36:45,660
So, No Styling, what song are you going to do?

1796
02:36:51,660 --> 02:36:55,660
We don't know what he's going to sing because he hasn't chosen and he doesn't know these songs.

1797
02:36:55,660 --> 02:36:57,660
So yeah.

1798
02:36:57,660 --> 02:36:59,660
What are you going to pick for him?

1799
02:36:59,660 --> 02:37:13,180
You'll laugh, you'll cry. It's a feel good song of the year. I'm coming out. Hit me with

1800
02:37:13,180 --> 02:37:15,180
Give me with your best shot.

1801
02:37:15,180 --> 02:37:17,180
Yes, yes.

1802
02:37:17,180 --> 02:37:20,180
Give me with your best shot.

1803
02:37:20,180 --> 02:37:22,180
Give me with your best shot.

1804
02:37:22,180 --> 02:37:24,180
No, that's killer.

1805
02:37:24,180 --> 02:37:26,180
That's all one go.

1806
02:37:29,180 --> 02:37:33,180
Did you ever know what you were meant to be?

1807
02:37:33,180 --> 02:37:37,180
No, Stalin will be singing Wind Beneath My Wings.

1808
02:37:38,180 --> 02:37:40,180
Everything I wish I could.

1809
02:37:40,180 --> 02:37:43,180
Yeah, the mic's got to be really close to your mouth, okay?

1810
02:37:43,180 --> 02:37:44,180
Alright, here we go.

1811
02:37:44,180 --> 02:37:50,180
No Stylin's version of Wind Beneath My Wings, and No Stylin will be singing at the party.

1812
02:37:50,180 --> 02:37:51,180
Alright, here we go.

1813
02:37:51,180 --> 02:37:52,180
Oh, yeah, okay.

1814
02:37:52,180 --> 02:37:53,180
No Stylin on Superstar TV.

1815
02:37:53,180 --> 02:37:54,180
Here we go.

1816
02:37:54,180 --> 02:37:58,180
No Stylin on Superstar TV with Wind Beneath My Wings.

1817
02:37:58,180 --> 02:37:59,180
Enjoy.

1818
02:37:59,180 --> 02:38:06,180
It must be happening cold, there it is, there it is, there it is.

1819
02:38:29,180 --> 02:38:36,180
in myself. Never have the light on your face. Your work content to let me shine. You always

1820
02:38:36,180 --> 02:38:54,220
your work content to let me shine you always walk the step of the night

1821
02:38:54,220 --> 02:39:22,220
So I was the one with all the strength, A beautiful face without a name, for so long.

1822
02:39:22,220 --> 02:39:24,220
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1823
02:39:24,220 --> 02:39:27,220
Thank you.

1824
02:39:27,220 --> 02:39:29,220
Boys.

1825
02:39:29,220 --> 02:39:37,220
Do you ever, ever let me know my hero?

1826
02:39:37,220 --> 02:39:45,220
Everything I would like to be.

1827
02:39:45,220 --> 02:39:50,220
I am an animal

1828
02:39:51,220 --> 02:39:56,220
For you are the one beneath my wings

1829
02:39:57,220 --> 02:40:00,220
I am an animal

1830
02:40:01,220 --> 02:40:03,220
I am a pig

1831
02:40:04,220 --> 02:40:06,220
I have a freak

1832
02:40:07,220 --> 02:40:09,220
I will eat all of this

1833
02:40:10,220 --> 02:40:13,220
But I've got it all here

1834
02:40:13,220 --> 02:40:18,220
You're in my heart

1835
02:40:19,220 --> 02:40:23,220
I want you to know I know the truth

1836
02:40:24,220 --> 02:40:31,220
I will be nothing without you

1837
02:40:34,220 --> 02:40:41,220
If you ever know that you're my hero

1838
02:40:41,220 --> 02:40:47,220
Oh, everything I would ever be.

1839
02:40:50,220 --> 02:40:53,220
I'm in my home.

1840
02:40:53,220 --> 02:40:57,220
I am a champion.

1841
02:40:57,220 --> 02:41:02,220
You are the wind beneath my wings.

1842
02:41:02,220 --> 02:41:11,220
Did I ever tell you my hero?

1843
02:41:11,220 --> 02:41:18,220
For everything I wish I could be

1844
02:41:18,220 --> 02:41:27,220
Oh and I, I could fly higher

1845
02:41:27,220 --> 02:41:43,220
For you are the wind beneath my wings, because you are the wind beneath my wings.

1846
02:41:43,220 --> 02:41:56,220
Oh, you are the wind beneath my wings.

1847
02:41:56,220 --> 02:42:04,180
Fly, fly, fly.

1848
02:42:04,180 --> 02:42:08,220
Fly, fly away.

1849
02:42:08,220 --> 02:42:10,060
Fly, fly, fly away.

1850
02:42:10,060 --> 02:42:11,120
Fly, fly, fly away.

1851
02:42:11,120 --> 02:42:12,020
Fly, fly, fly away.

1852
02:42:12,020 --> 02:42:13,020
Wow!

1853
02:42:13,020 --> 02:42:17,000
No Stylin has failed his song with 2,146 points.

1854
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:24,420
No Stylin failed Wind Beneath My Wings and Tenenga has broken down on stage and cried.

1855
02:42:24,420 --> 02:42:28,980
Alright, here you go you guys, this is how it's going to work, you guys are going to

1856
02:42:28,980 --> 02:42:29,980
vote for a winner.

1857
02:42:29,980 --> 02:42:35,140
The winner will come back and sing an encore song which will be selected at random by the

1858
02:42:35,140 --> 02:42:39,860
game unless, unless it's a song that we've already done, then we'll back out and pick

1859
02:42:39,860 --> 02:42:41,020
a different one, okay?

1860
02:42:41,020 --> 02:42:46,020
So here we go, just put it in the chat room, all in caps, who you want the winner to be.

1861
02:42:46,020 --> 02:42:53,820
You can vote for me, I sang Like A Virgin, you can vote for Magus who sang Power Of Love,

1862
02:42:53,820 --> 02:42:59,100
You can vote for a pixie dust who sang, what the hell did you sing, I forgot already.

1863
02:42:59,100 --> 02:43:01,380
You sang Don't Know Why, you sang the Noah Jones one.

1864
02:43:01,380 --> 02:43:06,540
And you can vote for Loki who sang Complicated at your request, or you can vote for No Stylin

1865
02:43:06,540 --> 02:43:08,740
who sang Wind Beneath My Wings.

1866
02:43:08,740 --> 02:43:16,380
So put all in caps right now who you want to sing again and who will play a random song.

1867
02:43:16,380 --> 02:43:20,620
We see some Rob, some No Stylin, we'll see.

1868
02:43:20,620 --> 02:43:24,620
There's going to be a tie between Loki and no stylin.

1869
02:43:24,620 --> 02:43:26,620
This is what it's going to be.

1870
02:43:26,620 --> 02:43:27,620
I predict it.

1871
02:43:27,620 --> 02:43:28,620
Minus Cleoparison.

1872
02:43:28,620 --> 02:43:31,620
Alright, you guys have a minute to flood our screen with your votes.

1873
02:43:31,620 --> 02:43:32,620
I won't fix you.

1874
02:43:32,620 --> 02:43:33,620
Sorry about that.

1875
02:43:33,620 --> 02:43:38,820
I guess people who don't like flooding, but my inbox is already full of your Ask Orange

1876
02:43:38,820 --> 02:43:40,620
Lounge questions, which we probably won't get to now.

1877
02:43:40,620 --> 02:43:43,620
I love Angel, she voted for me.

1878
02:43:43,620 --> 02:43:44,620
Okay, we see some Janaes.

1879
02:43:44,620 --> 02:43:46,620
Oh, I'm starting to see some Lokis.

1880
02:43:46,620 --> 02:43:58,980
Oh no, there's four lines for Loki. Victor, no styling. Um, let's see. Loki wins. Loki,

1881
02:43:58,980 --> 02:44:05,940
um, I don't know. It's kind of close. You guys, it's between me, Loki and no styling.

1882
02:44:05,940 --> 02:44:11,940
What do you think? What do you guys think? You guys didn't vote for me. You kind of thinking

1883
02:44:11,940 --> 02:44:13,940
I'm thinking, you did get a vote Janae, I did get one too.

1884
02:44:13,940 --> 02:44:15,940
I did, me.

1885
02:44:15,940 --> 02:44:17,940
You know what?

1886
02:44:17,940 --> 02:44:19,940
I'm thinking Loki is the winner.

1887
02:44:19,940 --> 02:44:23,940
Loki is going to do an encore presentation right now.

1888
02:44:23,940 --> 02:44:25,940
Loki is the winner.

1889
02:44:25,940 --> 02:44:27,940
Red wine.

1890
02:44:27,940 --> 02:44:29,940
No, I know.

1891
02:44:29,940 --> 02:44:31,940
Yes, yes!

1892
02:44:31,940 --> 02:44:33,940
No, no.

1893
02:44:33,940 --> 02:44:37,940
It's going to be randomly selected by the computer.

1894
02:44:37,940 --> 02:44:43,940
randomly selected by the computer. If it's a song we've already heard, we're going to cancel it out and do a different one because we want to hear something new.

1895
02:44:43,940 --> 02:44:45,940
Alright, ready Loki?

1896
02:44:45,940 --> 02:44:50,940
Alright.

1897
02:44:50,940 --> 02:44:55,940
This is no scoring mode, it's just playing karaoke fun. Actually, no wait, no, I'm sorry.

1898
02:44:55,940 --> 02:44:58,940
No wait, I don't remember how to get it to select random now.

1899
02:44:58,940 --> 02:45:04,940
Okay, you ready Loki? We're going to pick one completely at random. Here is the song Loki will be singing as his encore.

1900
02:45:04,940 --> 02:45:11,940
for. The wheel is spinning and it's landing on. It's the end of the world as we know it.

1901
02:45:11,940 --> 02:45:17,940
Alright, here we go. Loki singing is the end of the world as we know it at the county fair.

1902
02:45:17,940 --> 02:45:18,940
Enjoy.

1903
02:45:18,940 --> 02:45:29,940
Let's sing along. Yeah, group sing along.

1904
02:45:29,940 --> 02:45:34,940
I am so not singing this song, I'm just gonna...

1905
02:45:34,940 --> 02:45:39,940
That starts with an earthquake, birds and snakes and airplanes.

1906
02:45:39,940 --> 02:45:42,940
Lady Bruce is not afraid.

1907
02:45:42,940 --> 02:45:48,940
I am not afraid of words.

1908
02:45:48,940 --> 02:45:51,940
I don't like this song. I can't work with this.

1909
02:45:51,940 --> 02:45:54,940
Uh...uh...

1910
02:45:54,940 --> 02:45:58,940
I can't hit the pitch.

1911
02:45:58,940 --> 02:46:02,940
World has deck.

1912
02:46:02,940 --> 02:46:06,940
Dude, they're too fast. Give me a different song. Come on, seriously.

1913
02:46:06,940 --> 02:46:10,940
This is ridiculous. I can't remember this.

1914
02:46:10,940 --> 02:46:14,940
That means we are going to pick the song for him.

1915
02:46:14,940 --> 02:46:18,940
Right?

1916
02:46:18,940 --> 02:46:22,940
I can't work this. This is too fast.

1917
02:46:22,940 --> 02:46:39,780
What do you guys say, believe, like a girl, just want to have a, alright, I'm coming out,

The time has come for me

1951
02:50:27,900 --> 02:50:31,900
As a reminder, the show will be broadcast this week on Thursday.

1952
02:50:33,900 --> 02:50:41,900
A score of 6,964 points for Loki. Not even a gold record. There is no justice in this world. Okay.

1953
02:50:42,900 --> 02:50:46,940
Alright, we're gonna shut the game off now. Oh my god. I have not laughed that hard

1954
02:50:48,020 --> 02:50:54,420
My head I laugh so hard. I peed okay. I put a little I peed a little bit I

1955
02:50:55,020 --> 02:50:57,820
Can't lose my job anymore, so no sex tonight, huh?

1956
02:50:57,820 --> 02:51:14,300
out. Oh, that hurt so bad. Oh my God. I can't believe you. Okay. I should have been like,

1957
02:51:14,300 --> 02:51:21,260
I'm sliding in. You know, that would have been even better. But, alright. Whew, alright.

1958
02:51:21,260 --> 02:51:25,340
Luckily, the one person that Loki forgets has a recording is me.

1959
02:51:25,340 --> 02:51:26,340
Woo!

1960
02:51:26,340 --> 02:51:27,340
Alright.

1961
02:51:27,340 --> 02:51:31,300
My head hurts so bad.

1962
02:51:31,300 --> 02:51:34,660
Since we probably, we might run a little bit over tonight, but I don't think anybody cares

1963
02:51:34,660 --> 02:51:35,660
after that.

1964
02:51:35,660 --> 02:51:38,060
And to think, you guys wanted to end the segment before Loki sang.

1965
02:51:38,060 --> 02:51:39,460
I don't want to sing anymore.

1966
02:51:39,460 --> 02:51:41,460
I think we should make him sing again.

1967
02:51:41,460 --> 02:51:44,220
Oh, come on.

1968
02:51:44,220 --> 02:51:45,220
We have to...

1969
02:51:45,220 --> 02:51:46,220
It should be...

1970
02:51:46,220 --> 02:51:47,220
Okay, I got it.

1971
02:51:47,220 --> 02:51:48,220
It's going to have to be a bit.

1972
02:51:48,220 --> 02:51:49,220
It's the only reason people are going to tune into our show now.

1973
02:51:49,220 --> 02:51:53,220
It should be a duo between Victor and Loki.

1974
02:51:53,220 --> 02:51:57,220
You know what? When the Karaoke Revolution expansion pack comes out, Loki will sing again.

1975
02:51:57,220 --> 02:52:01,220
So, you're my fucking monkey, Loki will sing when I tell you to.

1976
02:52:01,220 --> 02:52:05,220
Dance, monkey dance.

1977
02:52:05,220 --> 02:52:09,220
What we're going to do when the expansion pack comes out, we'll do this again.

1978
02:52:09,220 --> 02:52:13,220
This is more incentive for Konami to get those expansion packs out.

1979
02:52:13,220 --> 02:52:17,220
As promised...

1980
02:52:17,220 --> 02:52:22,220
Oh my God, let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

1981
02:52:23,720 --> 02:52:25,960
I have no idea how we're gonna follow that segment,

1982
02:52:25,960 --> 02:52:27,440
but we'll sure try.

1983
02:52:27,440 --> 02:52:29,400
Will Pixie Dust take her top off?

1984
02:52:29,400 --> 02:52:31,280
Will Magus take his pants off?

1985
02:52:31,280 --> 02:52:34,640
I hope not, that would be a sign that make me blind.

1986
02:52:37,160 --> 02:52:40,000
Here we go, first question tonight, and ask Orange Lounge.

1987
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:41,840
No!

1988
02:52:43,840 --> 02:52:45,080
What happened?

1989
02:52:45,080 --> 02:52:55,080
Oh my God, I guess I missed it. Here we go. First question. First question from... I can't

1990
02:52:55,080 --> 02:52:59,320
find... Okay, here we go. Leadfoot would like to know, how did MobaMoga get into Extreme

1991
02:52:59,320 --> 02:53:07,640
and which one of you made it? Good, thank God. MobaMoga's by The Orange Lounge and it

1992
02:53:07,640 --> 02:53:11,560
got into Extreme because Konami got cheap and stopped licensing things. One more time,

1993
02:53:11,560 --> 02:53:16,560
says, Whew! I saw her do this! All right, Ledford would also like to know, what happened

1994
02:53:16,560 --> 02:53:20,780
to Orange Crush? That was kind of a regular segment we had on the show. Well, that's Rice

1995
02:53:20,780 --> 02:53:25,460
Princess's thing, and since she's not really on the show much anymore, because she spends

1996
02:53:25,460 --> 02:53:29,380
a lot of time coming over for Vanilla Sky. But of course, Rice Princess always welcome

1997
02:53:29,380 --> 02:53:33,620
at the show, and if she comes back, I'm hoping she'll bring some Orange Crush with her. A

1998
02:53:33,620 --> 02:53:38,420
good substitute would always be Vanilla Sky video game trivia, which you can hear on Vanilla

1999
02:53:38,420 --> 02:53:47,340
Sky, which is the bad music and video game trivia. Alright, so let's see. XBI would like

2000
02:53:47,340 --> 02:53:51,580
to know, what songs do you guys look forward to playing on Guitar Freak 10th or Drummania

2001
02:53:51,580 --> 02:53:57,620
9th Mix? None of them. None of them. It's the same fucking game over and over. Maybe

2002
02:53:57,620 --> 02:54:01,620
the Weezer song, One Time, for shits and giggles. I think that would be about it. I think they

2003
02:54:01,620 --> 02:54:07,820
play Mad Blast, but that wasn't on this one. No, I don't think it was. Alright. John Fields

2004
02:54:07,820 --> 02:54:12,300
would like to know, Loki, which Beatmania SIM do you prefer, and why do you prefer it

2005
02:54:12,300 --> 02:54:17,940
over the other, BM98 or Beatmania DX? I don't play Beatmania SIMs, but I play the emulators,

2006
02:54:17,940 --> 02:54:25,500
so that was kind of cool. But I was using a, what was it, Beatmania DX, whatever it

2007
02:54:25,500 --> 02:54:29,500
is. There's actually another one, too, that not many people know of. I can't remember

2008
02:54:29,500 --> 02:54:33,660
what exactly the name of it was, because I had the link on my old computer. But there's

2009
02:54:33,660 --> 02:54:40,840
There's another sim out there that's comparable to B-Mania DX.

2010
02:54:40,840 --> 02:54:46,120
Question from Jay Kinetic, Astro Glide or KY?

2011
02:54:46,120 --> 02:54:49,120
Pixie Dust says Astro Glide.

2012
02:54:49,120 --> 02:54:51,560
Nelly says KY.

2013
02:54:51,560 --> 02:54:53,000
Warming liquid says Nelly.

2014
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:59,000
I say choice number three, ID, which most of you have probably never heard of.

2015
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,440
Janae knows of it.

2016
02:55:01,440 --> 02:55:04,040
Anybody else care to answer this question?

2017
02:55:04,040 --> 02:55:07,160
No, all right then, moving on.

2018
02:55:07,160 --> 02:55:11,440
Darktits, oh, now's the vote for Loki's song.

2019
02:55:11,440 --> 02:55:13,940
SGhost would like to know, what package are you guys using

2020
02:55:13,940 --> 02:55:15,320
for Live 365?

2021
02:55:15,320 --> 02:55:16,760
I'm trying to start up a station,

2022
02:55:16,760 --> 02:55:18,100
and you seem to have a good thing going.

2023
02:55:18,100 --> 02:55:21,200
PS, I won't be playing anything on Sunday night, so you know.

2024
02:55:21,200 --> 02:55:22,940
Without getting into too many specifics,

2025
02:55:22,940 --> 02:55:24,780
I can talk about this more with you offline,

2026
02:55:24,780 --> 02:55:27,160
but we have the personal broadcaster package.

2027
02:55:27,160 --> 02:55:28,820
We don't run as a commercial station,

2028
02:55:28,820 --> 02:55:30,400
because we don't run our own in-house ads

2029
02:55:30,400 --> 02:55:31,320
or anything like that.

2030
02:55:31,320 --> 02:55:32,940
And we don't really have that many people

2031
02:55:32,940 --> 02:55:35,740
that listen that necessitate us needing hundreds

2032
02:55:35,740 --> 02:55:37,940
of simultaneous listeners.

2033
02:55:37,940 --> 02:55:39,540
So we have one of the personal packages.

2034
02:55:39,540 --> 02:55:42,380
I can give you the specifics offline.

2035
02:55:42,380 --> 02:55:45,980
He says he wants to do his own station.

2036
02:55:45,980 --> 02:55:47,380
Hey, sure, why not?

2037
02:55:47,380 --> 02:55:48,460
The more the merrier.

2038
02:55:48,460 --> 02:55:50,500
But you start a live talk show, I'll kill you.

2039
02:55:50,500 --> 02:55:51,700
No, I'm just kidding.

2040
02:55:51,700 --> 02:55:53,860
I'm kidding.

2041
02:55:53,860 --> 02:55:55,420
Because they were voting for the song

2042
02:55:55,420 --> 02:55:56,660
they wanted you to sing, Loki.

2043
02:55:56,660 --> 02:55:58,180
That's why I have all the PMs.

2044
02:55:58,180 --> 02:56:00,180
It's one of the personal broadcaster packages,

2045
02:56:00,180 --> 02:56:04,340
And it's reasonable, I guess, although I don't like the idea of having to pay to do this

2046
02:56:04,340 --> 02:56:05,340
show.

2047
02:56:05,340 --> 02:56:06,340
But whatever.

2048
02:56:06,340 --> 02:56:08,540
We had fun doing it and that's what it's all about.

2049
02:56:08,540 --> 02:56:12,340
EvilMalkey2Dx would like to know, when are you coming over to clean my house and the

2050
02:56:12,340 --> 02:56:13,900
plumbing?

2051
02:56:13,900 --> 02:56:20,660
Anytime in the place, baby.

2052
02:56:20,660 --> 02:56:21,660
That's it.

2053
02:56:21,660 --> 02:56:23,980
I'm out of questions unless somebody else wants to send along a new question.

2054
02:56:23,980 --> 02:56:28,660
Actually we probably should start to get wrapping up the show pretty soon here.

2055
02:56:28,660 --> 02:56:32,660
I'm having a lot of people ask me for a copy of the karaoke revolution segment.

2056
02:56:32,660 --> 02:56:35,020
What do you guys think we ought to do with that?

2057
02:56:35,020 --> 02:56:41,940
I'm thinking burn it, sell it on Ebay, the highest bidder, Kazaa, put it on Kazaa, we'll

2058
02:56:41,940 --> 02:56:42,940
see what happens.

2059
02:56:42,940 --> 02:56:44,780
I think it could be a good promotion show.

2060
02:56:44,780 --> 02:56:52,020
Loki and I have been busting our butts trying to get a new website done and when we have

2061
02:56:52,020 --> 02:56:58,500
that new website done in our downloads area we will put that up just for you guys.

2062
02:56:58,500 --> 02:57:05,500
You know what? We should get ourselves a listeners club. An Orange Lounge listeners club. Yeah.

2063
02:57:05,500 --> 02:57:11,060
Well, we have a message board, but none of us seem to use it, but it is over at calliebomani.com.

2064
02:57:11,060 --> 02:57:14,860
If you click on the evil board of randomness. Unfortunately, our phones have been a little

2065
02:57:14,860 --> 02:57:20,860
dead lately, but you can go there and revive them. We certainly wouldn't mind. I'm making

2066
02:57:20,860 --> 02:57:27,860
a sexy pose for pixie dust right now. I was just showing off my pillowy lips. Alright,

2067
02:57:29,940 --> 02:57:36,940
I guess we're going to close the mailbag now for Ask Orange Lounge. That was Orange Lounge

2068
02:57:40,820 --> 02:57:46,540
or should I say Ask Orange Lounge. The segment's over now so don't send any more questions.

2069
02:57:46,540 --> 02:57:50,540
We hope you learned something really useful.

2070
02:57:50,540 --> 02:57:54,540
The show's over, so we're going to end the segment right now.

2071
02:57:54,540 --> 02:57:58,540
All right.

2072
02:57:58,540 --> 02:58:04,540
Now's the part of the show where we go around and we get everybody's final thoughts.

2073
02:58:04,540 --> 02:58:07,540
Let's start with No Stalin.

2074
02:58:07,540 --> 02:58:08,540
Thank you for coming tonight.

2075
02:58:08,540 --> 02:58:10,540
No Stalin, no is your first show.

2076
02:58:10,540 --> 02:58:12,540
Kind of an interesting show to have as your first show.

2077
02:58:12,540 --> 02:58:14,540
I really like the show, you know.

2078
02:58:14,540 --> 02:58:15,540
Good.

2079
02:58:15,540 --> 02:58:21,540
them and me showing up. It's cool. Good times. Good times. Good times. G.T. like to say.

2080
02:58:21,540 --> 02:58:35,540
Yes. Your mom. Thank you. Who thought that over? Pixie Dust, your final thought. I'm

2081
02:58:35,540 --> 02:58:43,540
laying on the twenty-third or sixty-nine magnus in O's Island right now. I am such a slut,

2082
02:58:43,540 --> 02:58:50,660
but only one comes home with me tonight well that's Rob yes that's me I get to

2083
02:58:50,660 --> 02:58:57,540
come home I'm getting a restraining order shut up you fuck face all right

2084
02:58:57,540 --> 02:59:04,180
um let's see moving on um Magus your final thought for tonight why'd you have

2085
02:59:04,180 --> 02:59:09,620
to go ahead make things so complicated your final thought for tonight I didn't

2086
02:59:09,620 --> 02:59:18,020
think of one, damn you. I'm coming out. Oh my god, there's a milkshake! Milkshake! Cheeseburger!

2087
02:59:18,020 --> 02:59:23,740
Loki, your final thought. I want to sing it to you. Here it comes. Loki's gonna sing his

2088
02:59:23,740 --> 02:59:31,020
final thought tonight. Uh, no I'm not. Alright. I'm not gonna sing my final thought. Ah, I...

2089
02:59:31,020 --> 02:59:33,020
The hell is this wrapped around?

2090
02:59:33,020 --> 02:59:35,020
What the fuck?

2091
02:59:35,020 --> 02:59:37,020
Anyways...

2092
02:59:37,020 --> 02:59:39,020
Lisa's on my chair this time.

2093
02:59:39,020 --> 02:59:41,020
Um...

2094
02:59:41,020 --> 02:59:43,020
Please don't make me sing anywhere.

2095
02:59:43,020 --> 02:59:45,020
I don't...

2096
02:59:45,020 --> 02:59:47,020
We have an afterbirth coming up.

2097
02:59:47,020 --> 02:59:49,020
I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.

2098
02:59:49,020 --> 02:59:51,020
Fine! If they want to be tortured like that,

2099
02:59:51,020 --> 02:59:53,020
their masochist in the goddamn chat room, fine.

2100
02:59:53,020 --> 02:59:55,020
Alright.

2101
02:59:55,020 --> 02:59:57,020
We'll see.

2102
02:59:57,020 --> 02:59:59,020
Alright, uh, is that your final thought?

2103
02:59:59,020 --> 03:00:07,460
My final thought is, wow, I almost peed when Loki sang. That was amazing. Loki has driven

2104
03:00:07,460 --> 03:00:11,220
me to urinary movements in my body. That is amazing.

2105
03:00:11,220 --> 03:00:17,180
The final word of tonight, thank you guys for being here next week on the show, season

2106
03:00:17,180 --> 03:00:22,460
four premiere. Jamie's back in his house and will tell us all about our Alabama trip. DDR

2107
03:00:22,460 --> 03:00:27,340
Ultra Mix is out on the shelves and we'll be giving our impressions if we get a chance

2108
03:00:27,340 --> 03:00:33,660
to play it, actually, and more craziness. Tonight's final word I will give to Pixie

2109
03:00:33,660 --> 03:00:39,660
Dust. It's the final word, the one word to sum up the entire show and leave us on.

2110
03:00:39,660 --> 03:00:46,660
Twat. Clap. You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2111
03:00:46,980 --> 03:00:53,500
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sakura, Sky and Loki. We expect you a nice play again.

2112
03:00:53,500 --> 03:00:56,260
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2113
03:00:56,260 --> 03:00:59,020
What I really like about the movies, I like the previews for some reason.

2114
03:00:59,020 --> 03:01:00,020
I like to get there.

2115
03:01:00,020 --> 03:01:01,020
I don't want to see just the movie when I get there.

2116
03:01:01,020 --> 03:01:02,340
I got to see some previews first.

2117
03:01:02,340 --> 03:01:06,700
I like that guy with that deep voice, like, smoke like 10 packs of cigarettes.

2118
03:01:06,700 --> 03:01:10,980
One man, one way.

2119
03:01:10,980 --> 03:01:14,440
One desire.

2120
03:01:14,440 --> 03:01:16,080
They went too far.

2121
03:01:16,080 --> 03:01:18,140
They broke all the rules.

2122
03:01:18,140 --> 03:01:20,780
One man, Kermit the Frog as a pimp.

2123
03:01:20,780 --> 03:01:21,780
Where's my money?

2124
03:01:21,780 --> 03:01:26,920
Where is it?

2125
03:01:26,920 --> 03:01:31,980
One man, one way.

2126
03:01:31,980 --> 03:01:32,980
What a weird voice, Satan.

2127
03:01:32,980 --> 03:01:35,780
That's the only thing that guy could do for a living, you know?

2128
03:01:35,780 --> 03:01:37,380
He couldn't be a mechanic or anything.

2129
03:01:37,380 --> 03:01:41,260
Hey, uh, how much is that transmission gonna cost me?

2130
03:01:41,260 --> 03:01:44,700
An arm and a leg.

2131
03:01:44,700 --> 03:01:50,420
Just imagine having sex with somebody, that'd be hilarious, you know?

2132
03:01:50,420 --> 03:01:54,740
Oh yeah, the desire in your eyes.

2133
03:01:54,740 --> 03:01:58,540
The passion between us burns with fire.

2134
03:01:58,540 --> 03:02:01,540
Oh yeah, one way in, no way out.

2135
03:02:01,540 --> 03:02:11,220
Oh, same babble.

2136
03:02:11,220 --> 03:02:14,900

03:02:14,900 --> 03:02:21,900

03:02:27,860 --> 03:02:30,400

2140
03:02:30,400 --> 03:02:33,760
