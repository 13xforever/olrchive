1
00:00:10,092 --> 00:00:14,233
[SPEAKER_14]: Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

2
00:00:17,836 --> 00:00:20,397
[SPEAKER_21]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

3
00:00:20,697 --> 00:00:22,718
[SPEAKER_21]: Romani Talk and then some.

4
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:26,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

5
00:00:26,479 --> 00:00:30,481
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

6
00:00:31,121 --> 00:00:35,903
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

7
00:00:36,483 --> 00:00:40,184
[SPEAKER_21]: You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:42,005
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I will spank your child.

9
00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:44,126
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

10
00:00:48,922 --> 00:00:50,983
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, here's to my big opening.

11
00:00:51,504 --> 00:00:52,644
[SPEAKER_04]: A sphincter says what?

12
00:00:52,664 --> 00:00:54,906
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm super, thanks for asking.

13
00:00:55,286 --> 00:00:57,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.

14
00:00:57,928 --> 00:01:01,190
[SPEAKER_11]: What am I doing here?

15
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:01,490
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Dodge this.

17
00:01:03,552 --> 00:01:05,433
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a tasty burger.

18
00:01:05,673 --> 00:01:08,135
[SPEAKER_23]: Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.

19
00:01:08,355 --> 00:01:09,015
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, I have.

20
00:01:09,435 --> 00:01:11,217
[SPEAKER_23]: Look, it's a flesh wound.

21
00:01:11,437 --> 00:01:17,601
[SPEAKER_24]: Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie.

22
00:01:18,627 --> 00:01:19,348
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah?

23
00:01:19,568 --> 00:01:22,870
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

24
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,191
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura.

25
00:01:24,371 --> 00:01:25,212
[SPEAKER_21]: I've got a sniff.

26
00:01:25,532 --> 00:01:26,072
[SPEAKER_21]: Skye.

27
00:01:26,172 --> 00:01:28,254
[SPEAKER_21]: But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

28
00:01:28,634 --> 00:01:29,174
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki.

29
00:01:29,415 --> 00:01:30,435
[SPEAKER_21]: I hate you!

30
00:01:30,836 --> 00:01:32,977
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Lounge Radio.

31
00:01:34,738 --> 00:01:36,460
[SPEAKER_21]: We are live.

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:52,272
[SPEAKER_24]: for November the 16th of 2000 and wait for it, wait for it, three.

34
00:01:54,912 --> 00:02:01,453
[SPEAKER_24]: You're tuned in to the Bimani scenes most sexually charged for 99 cents a minute.

35
00:02:02,553 --> 00:02:08,074
[SPEAKER_24]: Radio station of all things between my legs and Bimani.

36
00:02:09,714 --> 00:02:11,415
[SPEAKER_24]: My name is Rob Roberts.

37
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:12,655
[SPEAKER_24]: You might know me as

38
00:02:13,744 --> 00:02:14,964
[SPEAKER_24]: Soft Bunny Lips.

39
00:02:16,945 --> 00:02:19,845
[SPEAKER_24]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.

40
00:02:20,785 --> 00:02:28,807
[SPEAKER_24]: In this corner, the most heterosexual tech boy on the farm, Mr. Loki.

41
00:02:30,127 --> 00:02:31,287
[SPEAKER_24]: He's a breast man.

42
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:35,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

43
00:02:37,928 --> 00:02:40,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, look at me.

44
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:41,469
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm acting so...

45
00:02:51,972 --> 00:03:01,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Also joining me tonight, well, she's not here, but she's somewhere being naughty.

46
00:03:02,196 --> 00:03:04,577
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Miss Jamie Summers.

47
00:03:04,997 --> 00:03:08,739
[SPEAKER_08]: She's off in Alabama being very, very naughty.

48
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:21,369
[SPEAKER_24]: So in her place tonight, we have a whole orgy of people, starting with the one and only Orange Lounge Madam.

49
00:03:22,429 --> 00:03:24,911
[SPEAKER_24]: Say hello to Pixie Dust.

50
00:03:25,671 --> 00:03:26,071
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi.

51
00:03:26,992 --> 00:03:28,693
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to fuck your brains out.

52
00:03:28,873 --> 00:03:29,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah.

53
00:03:29,614 --> 00:03:29,754
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh!

54
00:03:30,453 --> 00:03:31,233
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck yeah!

55
00:03:31,573 --> 00:03:37,015
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's infamous for me coming, being the Orange Lounge Madam, being on show 69 of all things.

56
00:03:37,755 --> 00:03:38,916
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, whatever.

57
00:03:39,176 --> 00:03:47,959
[SPEAKER_24]: Also joining us for this monumentally huge episode 69, say hello to Nurse Tylan.

58
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,980
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, I'm really sexy, am I?

59
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,601
[SPEAKER_15]: I just broke the queue.

60
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:54,461
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

61
00:03:55,815 --> 00:04:03,098
[SPEAKER_24]: Also joining us, straight from heaven, oh God, oh God, it's DDR Angel.

62
00:04:03,678 --> 00:04:05,779
[SPEAKER_14]: Bunnies have friends with tricks.

63
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Also with us tonight, say hello to the 69th Magus.

64
00:04:15,102 --> 00:04:19,664
[SPEAKER_08]: So, put your vibrators on autopilot and enjoy the ride.

65
00:04:21,765 --> 00:04:24,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Haha, even after you add more numbers, you're still not funny.

66
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:24,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah!

67
00:04:25,874 --> 00:04:27,576
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no turning back now!

68
00:04:27,796 --> 00:04:33,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, in all seriousness tonight, this is the episode we've been looking forward to for a long time, episode number 69.

69
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:43,049
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, we had to do something for it, because it was kind of starting to feel anticlimactic, you know, with Jamie not here, unfortunately, and just... Yeah, yeah.

70
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:50,656
[SPEAKER_08]: The one thing that's not going to be climactic tonight... I don't think anybody in that corner of the room is going to be climaxing anything today.

71
00:04:50,676 --> 00:04:52,638
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got to plug the cord in the hole.

72
00:04:53,564 --> 00:04:56,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Stick that cord, stick that network cord in somebody's hole.

73
00:04:56,566 --> 00:04:56,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Do it.

74
00:04:57,326 --> 00:04:57,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Do it, Loki.

75
00:04:57,946 --> 00:04:58,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Do it.

76
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:02,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, ViolentHyperGirl's going to come out here and she's going to bring her whip.

77
00:05:02,809 --> 00:05:03,429
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll bring mine.

78
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,451
[SPEAKER_08]: In all seriousness, we're not crazy.

79
00:05:05,511 --> 00:05:07,131
[SPEAKER_08]: There is going to be other stuff to talk about tonight.

80
00:05:07,152 --> 00:05:08,552
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a whole lot of stuff to talk about.

81
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:11,334
[SPEAKER_08]: There's DDR Ultra Mix coming out soon.

82
00:05:11,654 --> 00:05:12,174
[SPEAKER_08]: How was your week?

83
00:05:12,214 --> 00:05:12,815
[SPEAKER_08]: How was your day?

84
00:05:12,835 --> 00:05:17,237
[SPEAKER_08]: We have plenty to talk about when it comes to Final Fantasy XI, RekkaCon, and all that fun stuff.

85
00:05:18,278 --> 00:05:20,659
[SPEAKER_08]: And all sorts of interesting things and...

86
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:23,449
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

87
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:47,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now.

88
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:49,030
[SPEAKER_13]: Very naked.

89
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,891
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have to say, you have such nice breasts, Pixie Dust.

90
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:53,212
[SPEAKER_08]: You have very lovely breasts.

91
00:05:53,512 --> 00:05:53,872
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

92
00:05:54,553 --> 00:05:55,653
[SPEAKER_08]: You're very welcome.

93
00:05:55,753 --> 00:05:56,173
[SPEAKER_13]: And plants.

94
00:05:58,014 --> 00:05:59,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we're going to start this off.

95
00:05:59,335 --> 00:06:04,377
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to take a quick break with some music from Dancing Stage Fever, the new game that came out in Europe not too long ago.

96
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Some classic songs in there.

97
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:12,622
[SPEAKER_08]: You may have heard some of these tunes before, but now, if you're in Europe or you have a way of playing Dancing Stage Fever, you can play these songs.

98
00:06:12,802 --> 00:06:13,242
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back.

99
00:06:46,358 --> 00:06:47,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, we're going to have to can that.

100
00:06:47,558 --> 00:06:48,398
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what's going on.

101
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:51,739
[SPEAKER_08]: It's stopping going there, so let's see here.

102
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,599
[SPEAKER_08]: What I'll do is I'll copy the files over real fast.

103
00:06:53,619 --> 00:06:54,380
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll do it a different way.

104
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Something weird's running with the network right now.

105
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:01,962
[SPEAKER_08]: In the meantime, PastyDust will do her 900 operator impersonation for you.

106
00:07:03,362 --> 00:07:04,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Ring, ring, ring, ring.

107
00:07:04,782 --> 00:07:05,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

[SPEAKER_08]: I'm into sex and big things.

114

00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:31,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Get off my line.

120
00:07:31,022 --> 00:07:35,303

122
00:07:36,744 --> 00:07:40,665
[SPEAKER_08]: The network's running really slow today, so I'm not able to run things off the network very well.

123
00:07:42,873 --> 00:07:44,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's because we have a lot of stuff going through our network right now.

124
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,117
[SPEAKER_08]: So, sorry, guys.

125

140
00:13:31,481 --> 00:13:32,221
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to bring that in.

141
00:13:32,661 --> 00:13:47,948
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the way, for those of you guys that have played Karaoke Revolution yet, once you guys unlock the song one week, we haven't done it here yet because I've been lazy and I haven't played Karaoke Revolution all week, but once you unlock the song one week, apparently you get a video with it, and in that video, Mel makes a cameo.

142
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:52,797
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it's all these different people singing the song or something like that, and he's in it.

143
00:13:53,237 --> 00:13:55,458
[SPEAKER_08]: So be on the lookout for that.

00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,151
[SPEAKER_08]: The what?

154
00:14:11,311 --> 00:14:11,991
[SPEAKER_14]: The Eagle Eye Cherry Song.

155
00:14:12,011 --> 00:14:12,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Safe Tonight?

156
00:14:12,892 --> 00:14:14,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I can get a good score on that one.

157
00:14:15,614 --> 00:14:16,815
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe because Bert's helping, you see.

158
00:14:17,116 --> 00:14:21,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe if we get bored the last segment, we could fire up Karaoke Revolution and see who's an all-star here.

159
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,200
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I haven't seen it yet.

160
00:14:23,761 --> 00:14:24,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe, maybe.

161
00:14:24,642 --> 00:14:26,523
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see how desperate for material we get.

162
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:26,903
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

163
00:14:26,963 --> 00:14:27,264
[SPEAKER_14]: Desperate?

164
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:28,265
[SPEAKER_14]: Who says we're ever desperate?

165
00:14:29,726 --> 00:14:30,707
[SPEAKER_08]: It's episode 69.

166
00:14:30,747 --> 00:14:31,948
[SPEAKER_08]: We're very, very desperate.

167
00:14:31,968 --> 00:14:33,889
[SPEAKER_13]: Speaking of desperate, hey, Andrew, how are you doing?

168
00:14:37,037 --> 00:14:38,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful.

169
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:40,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I ain't desperate for nothing.

170
00:14:42,241 --> 00:14:42,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?

171
00:14:42,921 --> 00:14:44,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, how about a good joke?

172
00:14:48,145 --> 00:14:54,430
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, in that break, during... In that break, we played a bunch of stuff from Dancing Sage Fever... Fever?

173
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Fee-ger?

174
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Fever!

175
00:14:57,011 --> 00:15:00,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Dancing Sage... Feces, yes.

176
00:15:00,154 --> 00:15:00,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

177
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:12,678
[SPEAKER_08]: and in Dancing Stage Faces, that's a joke for you Sacramento people, in Dancing Stage Faces we have Asa Bass with All That She Wants, Dexy's Midnight Runners with Come On Eileen and Thin Lizzy with The Boys Are Back In Town.

178
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:17,661
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe later on in the show we'll play some of the less good tracks from it, so we'll see.

179
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:18,862
I came on Eileen.

180
00:15:20,043 --> 00:15:21,023
[SPEAKER_08]: What'd you say, Loki?

181
00:15:21,324 --> 00:15:22,364
[SPEAKER_08]: I came on Eileen.

182
00:15:22,765 --> 00:15:24,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the song did say come on Eileen.

183
00:15:24,386 --> 00:15:24,846
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

184
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:36,597
[SPEAKER_08]: I figure, even though it's episode number 69, I figured we'd start the show off as we always do, with a little bit of, how was your day, how was your week?

185
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:40,721
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's go around and see how everybody's day and their week was.

186
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:44,124
[SPEAKER_08]: I will start tonight, because I never start this segment off, so I'm going to start.

187
00:15:45,265 --> 00:15:50,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Yesterday was the one and only, for those of you in NorCal, Wreck-A-Con.

188
00:15:51,221 --> 00:15:57,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is a small convention they did at a community college for anime and video games and all that dorky fun stuff.

189
00:15:57,384 --> 00:16:01,786
[SPEAKER_08]: And they did this at a community college in Pittsburgh, California, which is in the East Bay.

190
00:16:02,346 --> 00:16:05,508
[SPEAKER_08]: And this was my very first anime convention.

191
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:11,431
[SPEAKER_08]: And Pixie Dust just had her period right through her pants.

192
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:13,212
[SPEAKER_08]: That is amazing.

193
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,632
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell did you do, Pixie Dust?

194
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:15,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Give her a mic.

195
00:16:15,953 --> 00:16:16,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Give her a mic.

196
00:16:17,814 --> 00:16:18,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's definitely sweet.

197
00:16:18,855 --> 00:16:19,635
[SPEAKER_08]: The power's off.

198
00:16:21,688 --> 00:16:23,068
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!

199
00:16:23,128 --> 00:16:24,329
[SPEAKER_04]: That wasn't even a joke.

200
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:25,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you catch that?

201
00:16:25,469 --> 00:16:27,569
[SPEAKER_04]: He just made another nonsense joke.

202
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:28,790
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not really that great.

203
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,850
[SPEAKER_13]: It just looks like it was a painting, so it's okay.

204
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:38,232
[SPEAKER_08]: It just looks like... It just looks like she got rammed so hard that she's bleeding right now.

205
00:16:38,772 --> 00:16:40,192
[SPEAKER_13]: We won't talk about last night, Rob.

206
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:47,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they missed by a long shot, because that's your thigh, and nowhere near where it needs to be.

207
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:49,714
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, right here, you know...

208
00:16:50,965 --> 00:16:52,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, RekkaCon, hello.

209
00:16:53,527 --> 00:16:56,289
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we have people listening today that actually went to RekkaCon yesterday.

210
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,410
[SPEAKER_08]: So hello to all our new listeners that were at RekkaCon yesterday.

211
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:05,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I whored out the station and the business cards and Jahi, bless his little heart, let me get on the mic and kind of plug things too.

212
00:17:05,795 --> 00:17:06,696
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was very nice of him.

213
00:17:06,756 --> 00:17:07,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Jahi.

214
00:17:08,657 --> 00:17:10,158
[SPEAKER_08]: So, what did you guys think of RekkaCon?

215
00:17:10,178 --> 00:17:10,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you guys have a good time?

216
00:17:10,878 --> 00:17:11,999
[SPEAKER_08]: What kind of stuff did you guys do?

217
00:17:12,139 --> 00:17:14,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything you saw for the first time, got to play for the first time, things like that?

218
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:15,702
[SPEAKER_08]: No styling?

219
00:17:16,042 --> 00:17:17,143
[SPEAKER_15]: I just walked around, man.

220
00:17:17,343 --> 00:17:17,983
[SPEAKER_08]: You just walked around?

221
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:18,844
[SPEAKER_08]: You were just there for the people?

222
00:17:18,864 --> 00:17:18,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

223
00:17:20,604 --> 00:17:21,285
[SPEAKER_15]: That's like me.

224
00:17:21,645 --> 00:17:22,445
[SPEAKER_15]: Basically, that's it.

225
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,186
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like me.

226
00:17:24,186 --> 00:17:26,788
[SPEAKER_08]: There hasn't been any DDR tournaments in NorCal really lately.

227
00:17:26,808 --> 00:17:28,949
[SPEAKER_08]: There was one a couple weeks ago, but I couldn't go.

228
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:33,012
[SPEAKER_08]: So this was kind of like a chance for me to see everybody because I haven't seen them in a long time.

229
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:37,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you get to play any new interesting games or did you buy anything at the expo or anything like that?

230
00:17:39,696 --> 00:17:40,637
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, it's completely broken.

231
00:17:40,657 --> 00:17:42,778
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought nothing was necessary.

232
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:43,739
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

233
00:17:45,835 --> 00:17:47,216
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to ask, no milkshakes?

234
00:17:47,757 --> 00:17:48,917
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no milkshakes.

235
00:17:49,018 --> 00:17:49,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

236
00:17:50,218 --> 00:17:50,679
[SPEAKER_15]: None at all.

237
00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:51,399
[SPEAKER_08]: None at all.

238
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:54,141
[SPEAKER_15]: What the fuck?

239
00:17:54,201 --> 00:17:57,324
[SPEAKER_15]: I find that weird, you know, just everybody comes up to me and says milkshake.

240
00:17:57,624 --> 00:18:00,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, okay, I'm just going to say it.

241
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:04,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Your online personality and your in-life personality are so different.

242
00:18:04,849 --> 00:18:07,771
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so different, no stylist.

243
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:10,013
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, not that it's a bad thing, I'm just saying.

244
00:18:10,753 --> 00:18:12,735
[SPEAKER_13]: Now it looks like I peed on myself since I tried to clean it up.

245
00:18:16,181 --> 00:18:18,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you hand the mic off to Angel over there?

246
00:18:20,145 --> 00:18:21,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Angel, what did you think of WreckerCon?

247
00:18:22,087 --> 00:18:22,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Sweet.

248
00:18:22,607 --> 00:18:24,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you get to play any new games for the first time or do anything?

249
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:26,631
[SPEAKER_14]: That Tycho one.

250
00:18:26,691 --> 00:18:27,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Tycho no Tatooine?

251
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:29,593
[SPEAKER_14]: The drum game?

252
00:18:30,614 --> 00:18:31,075
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, hi.

253
00:18:32,636 --> 00:18:36,440
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to see the... Did somebody just say that Janae had a maxi period?

254
00:18:39,322 --> 00:18:40,383
[SPEAKER_08]: That was horrible.

255
00:18:40,644 --> 00:18:41,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Die.

256
00:18:45,712 --> 00:18:49,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, Angel, yesterday, Wreck-It-Con.

257
00:18:53,936 --> 00:18:54,636
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

258
00:18:54,656 --> 00:18:58,378
[SPEAKER_14]: I almost brought Battle Royale manga, but I resisted.

259
00:18:58,398 --> 00:19:00,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you're poor.

260
00:19:01,479 --> 00:19:02,820
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.

261
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:09,788
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, not really, but yeah, I mean, there's better things I should be saving for at the moment, so.

262
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,769
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, yeah, so is life.

263
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:13,769
[SPEAKER_14]: Excuse me.

264
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:14,369
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

265
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:15,209
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.

266
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you meet anybody new yesterday you hadn't met before?

267
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:21,811
[SPEAKER_14]: Shahi, Mr. Wendell, obviously no style in.

268
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:28,512
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, Iwonaoki2DX, StaplerX, let's see, I could go on and on.

269
00:19:28,932 --> 00:19:31,733
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, and a bunch of their friends who came over.

270
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:35,035
[SPEAKER_14]: Dragon Quest Slime Morimori Adventures

271
00:19:54,414 --> 00:19:56,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, the Dragon Quest with a real sword.

272
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:57,737
[SPEAKER_08]: That game looked so sweet.

273
00:19:57,757 --> 00:19:58,558
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't get a chance to play it.

274
00:19:58,578 --> 00:20:03,363
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the most popular thing in the game room, and everybody was kind of crowded around it, but it looked really cute.

275
00:20:03,844 --> 00:20:08,328
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to play it, but I love the way the enemies are drawn.

276
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:11,071
[SPEAKER_08]: They updated all the enemies, like the slimes.

277
00:20:11,271 --> 00:20:13,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, not just cel-shaded, but they made them look sweet.

278
00:20:13,193 --> 00:20:15,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the cel-shaded, the redone, it looks good.

279
00:20:15,456 --> 00:20:16,577
[SPEAKER_05]: It plays pretty well.

280
00:20:17,077 --> 00:20:18,178
[SPEAKER_08]: I was kind of surprised, though.

281
00:20:18,198 --> 00:20:25,881
[SPEAKER_08]: I was thinking that the Dragon Quest Sword game was going to be just like... Somebody had told me, oh, it's just the very first Dragon Quest, except you use a sword as a controller.

282
00:20:25,901 --> 00:20:26,902
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, well, that's kind of weird.

283
00:20:27,222 --> 00:20:29,103
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's actually this whole new original game.

284
00:20:29,483 --> 00:20:33,044
[SPEAKER_08]: It kind of struck me as like a Super Scope game to me.

285
00:20:33,104 --> 00:20:35,346
[SPEAKER_08]: It looked a lot like a game you'd be playing with a Super Scope.

286
00:20:36,126 --> 00:20:39,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you'd be shooting the slimes, but instead you use the sword.

287
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:43,882
[SPEAKER_08]: That was fun.

288
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:44,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Good times.

289
00:20:45,023 --> 00:20:46,783
[SPEAKER_06]: We got to meet a lot of new faces.

290
00:20:46,943 --> 00:20:49,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically met everyone that Angel met.

291
00:20:50,024 --> 00:20:50,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

292
00:20:51,365 --> 00:20:52,045
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a good time.

293
00:20:52,305 --> 00:20:55,266
[SPEAKER_06]: We watched some AMVs in the video room.

294
00:20:55,286 --> 00:20:57,586
[SPEAKER_08]: What were some good music videos you guys saw?

295
00:20:57,726 --> 00:20:59,607
[SPEAKER_06]: The chibi things that kill.

296
00:21:01,287 --> 00:21:04,308
[SPEAKER_06]: A complete waste of 6 minutes and 45 seconds.

297
00:21:04,608 --> 00:21:04,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

298
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:05,789
[SPEAKER_06]: And...

299
00:21:08,922 --> 00:21:16,644
[SPEAKER_06]: This one to In The Navy, where they started spoofing all these Battle Cruiser animes.

300
00:21:17,404 --> 00:21:17,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

301
00:21:18,264 --> 00:21:18,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

302
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:19,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool deal.

303
00:21:20,704 --> 00:21:22,405
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, Wreck-It-Con was just, it was great.

304
00:21:22,485 --> 00:21:23,765
[SPEAKER_08]: It was my first convention.

305
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:28,926
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never been to any kind of anime or geek convention, really, ever, unless you count Rocky Horror Conventions.

306
00:21:28,966 --> 00:21:29,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are kind of geeky.

307
00:21:30,126 --> 00:21:33,587
[SPEAKER_08]: But actually, that's more of like a sex thing, because people get laid at those, except me.

308
00:21:33,607 --> 00:21:38,408
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, but ironically enough, a Rocky Horror Convention was the very first place I ever played DDR.

309
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:49,524
[SPEAKER_08]: but anyway, that was my first non-RockyCon and good times, I just like getting to see people I don't know much about anime, I don't really watch a lot of it admittedly I'm one of those few DDR players that just

310
00:21:50,353 --> 00:21:57,198
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen a couple Miyazaki films, and I watched Pokemon back when it was cool, but I haven't really gotten as into anime.

311
00:21:57,238 --> 00:21:58,659
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of rely on Jamie for all that.

312
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:01,361
[SPEAKER_08]: She's really into anime, and she just kind of tells me what's good and what's not.

313
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:05,643
[SPEAKER_08]: And Loki, being the hookup, also knows some good and not good things.

314
00:22:06,044 --> 00:22:07,685
[SPEAKER_08]: But I saw a lot of great cosplayers.

315
00:22:07,705 --> 00:22:08,946
[SPEAKER_08]: There were some cute cosplayers.

316
00:22:09,206 --> 00:22:12,788
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a lot of Final Fantasy cosplayers, and I'm always a sucker for anything Final Fantasy.

317
00:22:12,808 --> 00:22:15,130
[SPEAKER_08]: And there were some X2 characters...

318
00:22:15,905 --> 00:22:20,487
[SPEAKER_08]: and there was a whole little group that had like a Squall and a Yuffie and all this stuff in it.

319
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:21,107
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really cute.

320
00:22:21,748 --> 00:22:26,950
[SPEAKER_08]: And one thing that made me very happy is that there was a Mai.

321
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody came dressed as Mai from Final Fight.

322
00:22:28,911 --> 00:22:29,551
[SPEAKER_08]: So that made me happy.

323
00:22:29,611 --> 00:22:30,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Or not Final Fight, Fatal Fury.

324
00:22:31,052 --> 00:22:31,632
[SPEAKER_08]: That made me happy.

325
00:22:32,113 --> 00:22:33,233
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I love Mai.

326
00:22:34,694 --> 00:22:35,874
[SPEAKER_14]: Link was cool.

327
00:22:36,415 --> 00:22:39,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, they had not just one, but like two people dressed up as Link.

328
00:22:39,836 --> 00:22:41,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, they had a Link and a Saria.

329
00:22:43,050 --> 00:23:11,953
[SPEAKER_08]: and later on they had like after the cosplay they had karaoke so we had like a guy dressed up as Zell singing Invoke rather well too and if you've ever been to an anime convention at all Ramen and Rice had shown up to this one as well oh my god now people tell me Ramen and Rice are at every single anime convention in the area so it's kind of like but this is the first time I saw them and I was like

330
00:23:12,353 --> 00:23:13,574
[SPEAKER_08]: They are so cool.

331
00:23:13,795 --> 00:23:16,437
[SPEAKER_08]: These girls play like everything on their violins.

332
00:23:16,718 --> 00:23:18,219
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to get some of their stuff for the station.

333
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:20,542
[SPEAKER_08]: I should email, do some emails.

334
00:23:20,902 --> 00:23:24,426
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a violinist myself, and they're awesome.

335
00:23:24,506 --> 00:23:26,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I would have thought you were a pianist.

336
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,090
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but I have one.

337
00:23:30,912 --> 00:23:31,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Crap.

338
00:23:32,474 --> 00:23:33,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Be more funny.

339
00:23:34,376 --> 00:23:35,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Follow your advice.

340
00:23:37,222 --> 00:23:41,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, we wound up requesting, like, Butterfly and Scars of Time from Carameldansen.

341
00:23:41,724 --> 00:23:42,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn you!

342
00:23:42,064 --> 00:23:42,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn you!

343
00:23:42,245 --> 00:23:43,705
[SPEAKER_06]: You're the one that got them to play Butterfly.

344
00:23:43,745 --> 00:23:45,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I'm the one that got them to play Butterfly.

345
00:23:45,106 --> 00:23:46,567
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you die, and you burn in hell.

346
00:23:47,867 --> 00:23:48,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kidding.

347
00:23:48,268 --> 00:23:49,408
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty hot in this room already.

348
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:53,610
[SPEAKER_14]: Walked right into the pianist's quote, didn't you, Magus?

349
00:23:55,931 --> 00:23:59,073
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have given my left nut to hear them play Scars of Time.

350
00:23:59,113 --> 00:24:00,654
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so sad I didn't stay around for that.

351
00:24:00,694 --> 00:24:01,414
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet it kicked ass.

352
00:24:01,434 --> 00:24:02,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I did, and I still have mine.

353
00:24:04,053 --> 00:24:07,855
[SPEAKER_08]: I did hear them play some stuff from Final Fantasy X, though, which made me all horny, because it was great.

354
00:24:08,376 --> 00:24:14,319
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, uh, see, at the time they played Scars of Time, you hadn't gotten there yet, Mr. Fashionably Late.

355
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:15,760
[SPEAKER_14]: Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, bitch.

356
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,741
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just kidding.

357
00:24:17,761 --> 00:24:18,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Love you.

358
00:24:18,642 --> 00:24:19,562
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, really?

359
00:24:20,243 --> 00:24:21,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's take it outside.

360
00:24:21,523 --> 00:24:22,024
[SPEAKER_08]: In a good way.

361
00:24:22,284 --> 00:24:23,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, really?

362
00:24:24,305 --> 00:24:24,865
[SPEAKER_08]: In a good way.

363
00:24:24,885 --> 00:24:24,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

364
00:24:29,389 --> 00:24:34,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, we have lots of new faces in our chat room tonight, so just hello to all our new chatters.

365
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,418
[SPEAKER_08]: I see Captain Canada in here tonight, we haven't had him in a while.

366
00:24:36,678 --> 00:24:38,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Jahi's here tonight, hello.

367
00:24:39,481 --> 00:24:43,366
[SPEAKER_08]: It was so great seeing you with Kanye yesterday, and I see S-Ghost, somebody new I haven't seen before.

368
00:24:44,027 --> 00:24:46,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Violent Hypergirl's here, I haven't seen her in a long time.

369
00:24:47,591 --> 00:24:48,412
[SPEAKER_08]: and all sorts of people.

370
00:24:49,053 --> 00:24:50,594
[SPEAKER_08]: XVI, as he likes to be called.

371
00:24:51,175 --> 00:24:54,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Brandon, all these people I don't get to talk to too much.

372
00:24:54,358 --> 00:24:55,679
[SPEAKER_08]: But they're in the chat room tonight, so hello.

373
00:24:55,739 --> 00:24:57,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Head on over to www.cali.com.

374
00:24:58,262 --> 00:25:01,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Click on Orange Lounge and click on chat to join our chat room.

375
00:25:04,448 --> 00:25:05,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Jahi, by the way.

376
00:25:06,144 --> 00:25:08,425
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the greatest MCs I've ever seen.

377
00:25:08,785 --> 00:25:11,107
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear to God I want him to MC a DDR tournament.

378
00:25:11,367 --> 00:25:17,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Yesterday I would see him on the mic and people were breakdancing and stuff and he's sitting there going, you know, he's doing his thing.

379
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:18,971
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't even impersonate it so great.

380
00:25:18,991 --> 00:25:19,711
[SPEAKER_08]: He's doing his thing.

381
00:25:19,891 --> 00:25:21,752
[SPEAKER_08]: And then like I come back an hour later and there he goes.

382
00:25:21,792 --> 00:25:23,593
[SPEAKER_08]: He's still going and he's into it.

383
00:25:24,113 --> 00:25:24,634
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a man.

384
00:25:24,714 --> 00:25:25,114
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a man.

385
00:25:25,854 --> 00:25:27,275
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got to come up and be on the show sometime.

386
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:37,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, so also on How Was My Week, How Was My Day, something worth noting, talking about is this thing that I did on Thursday.

387
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:43,504
[SPEAKER_08]: I got asked to promote Orange Lounge Radio in a way at this local high school.

388
00:25:43,624 --> 00:25:46,505
[SPEAKER_08]: I judged a local high school's American Idol style competition.

389
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:50,466
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was very interesting.

390
00:25:51,026 --> 00:25:53,007
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if anybody from there is listening tonight.

391
00:25:53,047 --> 00:25:55,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably not because they only mentioned the station like twice.

392
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:56,608
[SPEAKER_08]: I only gave out one business card to...

393
00:25:57,682 --> 00:26:14,086
[SPEAKER_08]: The guy who I thought was most talented out of everybody Mostly because he wrote his own music And it was fucking funny It was something like Adam Sandler would have done And I'm actually in talks with him right now Trying to get a song of his to spin on the show So you guys can see what I'm talking about But it was very interesting because it was

394
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:22,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Me, and two interns from one of the local Sacramento stations, or I don't know, they work in the promotions department or something like that, and two teachers.

395
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:34,114
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was supposed to be like all these local celebrities, and I was going to be like the nobody, but I ended up being the only one that actually was on a radio program of any kind, so that was kind of interesting.

396
00:26:34,754 --> 00:26:37,755
[SPEAKER_08]: I also ended up being the asshole judge, because I was the only one...

397
00:26:38,479 --> 00:26:41,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Willing to say anything remotely constructive about anybody.

398
00:26:42,261 --> 00:26:45,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Because everybody, all the other judges are like, Oh my God, you were so great.

399
00:26:45,982 --> 00:26:47,123
[SPEAKER_10]: You were just like Clay Aiken.

400
00:26:47,143 --> 00:26:48,283
[SPEAKER_10]: You're better than Clay Aiken.

401
00:26:48,423 --> 00:26:49,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my God.

402
00:26:49,543 --> 00:26:51,444
[SPEAKER_10]: You should be an American Idol, okay?

403
00:26:52,465 --> 00:26:54,305
[SPEAKER_08]: You have an awesome voice.

404
00:26:55,286 --> 00:26:58,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and then the one guy was like, You have an awesome voice.

405
00:26:59,568 --> 00:27:00,688
[SPEAKER_08]: You are going to go far.

406
00:27:00,748 --> 00:27:04,630
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the next person was like, You're going to go so far because you have an awesome voice.

407
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:07,891
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the next person would come up and go, You...

408
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,360
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

409
00:27:29,867 --> 00:27:30,648
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, type thing.

410
00:27:31,008 --> 00:27:33,270
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there was another girl.

411
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,991
[SPEAKER_08]: This was the one that pissed me off, though.

412
00:27:35,011 --> 00:27:38,574
[SPEAKER_08]: This was weird because I haven't been back to high school in a long time.

413
00:27:38,894 --> 00:27:42,217
[SPEAKER_08]: This was the first time I'd kind of... Shut up.

414
00:27:42,517 --> 00:27:43,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

415
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:45,099
[SPEAKER_08]: I graduated in 96.

416
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:45,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck you.

417
00:27:48,202 --> 00:27:49,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Seven years ago, bitch.

418
00:27:51,845 --> 00:27:52,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

419
00:27:52,645 --> 00:27:53,106
[SPEAKER_08]: You thought.

420
00:27:53,266 --> 00:27:54,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you need to think more next time.

421
00:27:54,767 --> 00:27:55,167
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just kidding.

422
00:27:55,187 --> 00:27:55,668
[SPEAKER_08]: I love you.

423
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:57,810
[SPEAKER_08]: You've been a bad girl.

424
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,450
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to punish you.

425
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,971
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't set foot in a high school in a long time and I remembered why.

426
00:28:03,991 --> 00:28:09,373
[SPEAKER_08]: There was this one girl up there who, I guess she wasn't that popular or something because she did her thing.

427
00:28:09,393 --> 00:28:10,833
[SPEAKER_08]: She was singing Hit We With Her Best Shot.

428
00:28:11,193 --> 00:28:12,293
[SPEAKER_08]: And she was doing a good job.

429
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:14,314
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I would have liked to have seen her get into it a little more.

430
00:28:14,354 --> 00:28:16,415
[SPEAKER_08]: But she, you know, had a lot of courage to get up there on stage.

431
00:28:16,435 --> 00:28:17,295
[SPEAKER_08]: And she was having fun with it.

432
00:28:17,315 --> 00:28:18,315
[SPEAKER_08]: It looked like she had a lot of fun with it.

433
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:23,437
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course it goes, and the first person goes, it goes, Oh my God, you were really great.

434
00:28:23,457 --> 00:28:25,358
[SPEAKER_10]: You're just like Kelly Clarkson.

435
00:28:25,658 --> 00:28:27,778
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're going to be better than her.

436
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,359
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the next person got up and goes,

437
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:33,522
[SPEAKER_08]: You have a totally awesome voice and it's going to take you so far in life.

438
00:28:33,862 --> 00:28:37,645
[SPEAKER_08]: And then somebody else in the audience goes, these people in the audience start yelling, liar!

439
00:28:39,126 --> 00:28:48,212
[SPEAKER_08]: And while it was like mildly amusing, I was like, okay, that's fucked up and you shouldn't do that when this girl, this poor girl is getting up on stage, you know, making a fool out of herself for your entertainment.

440
00:28:49,113 --> 00:28:52,055
[SPEAKER_08]: So the mic got over to me and I said, hey, you know what?

441
00:28:52,748 --> 00:28:55,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Girl, you got a lot of balls to get up here on stage and do that.

442
00:28:55,530 --> 00:29:00,495
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're going to go, you know, you're going to be able to accomplish a lot in life, unlike some of these people who will be sitting in the dark forever.

443
00:29:01,435 --> 00:29:05,318
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the guys in the audience are like, rubble, rubble, rubble.

444
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:10,483
[SPEAKER_08]: And the teacher next to me leaned over and said, thank you for saying that.

445
00:29:11,043 --> 00:29:11,884
[SPEAKER_08]: And that made me feel good.

446
00:29:12,304 --> 00:29:13,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I hate assholes.

447
00:29:13,765 --> 00:29:14,186
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate them.

448
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,808
[SPEAKER_08]: And most people in high school were just like the ones I hated.

449
00:29:17,068 --> 00:29:18,609
[SPEAKER_08]: And would call me fag all the time and stuff.

450
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,331
[SPEAKER_08]: And they need to, like, burn in hell.

451
00:29:20,671 --> 00:29:21,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they suck.

452
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:23,781
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care if they were right, Nelly.

453
00:29:24,201 --> 00:29:24,722
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter.

454
00:29:24,742 --> 00:29:25,683
[SPEAKER_08]: That's beside the point.

455
00:29:25,943 --> 00:29:26,724
[SPEAKER_08]: You're missing the point.

456
00:29:28,806 --> 00:29:30,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, that was my week and my day.

457
00:29:30,647 --> 00:29:34,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, how was your week and your day?

458
00:29:35,432 --> 00:29:36,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that eventful.

459
00:29:36,914 --> 00:29:44,221
[SPEAKER_08]: I built a computer and upgraded my... Well, I upgraded mine so much that I pretty much built another computer.

460
00:29:45,402 --> 00:29:45,743
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

461
00:29:46,906 --> 00:29:50,988
[SPEAKER_08]: It's odd because this computer runs like Final Fantasy XI really nice.

462
00:29:51,128 --> 00:29:56,090
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, just with all the settings on high, it still runs good.

463
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:03,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Yet, it won't run ConquerCam, and yet I'm downloading off the internet and I'm only getting like 1kbps.

464
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,353
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like, I don't get it.

465
00:30:06,414 --> 00:30:09,295
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't, whatever, it's fine I guess.

466
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:14,917
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's, you know, I've got a larger hard drive and I have a computer for my cabinets.

467
00:30:16,896 --> 00:30:18,877
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to go to Fry's a lot this weekend.

468
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:19,618
[SPEAKER_03]: That sucked.

469
00:30:19,698 --> 00:30:23,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

470
00:30:24,081 --> 00:30:27,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Went to that thing that Rob was talking about, and that was okay.

471
00:30:27,843 --> 00:30:32,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I didn't do much.

472
00:30:34,307 --> 00:30:35,588
[SPEAKER_08]: My week was awesome.

473
00:30:35,748 --> 00:30:37,028
[SPEAKER_08]: It will take me far in life.

474
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Yelled at people today.

475
00:30:41,911 --> 00:30:42,732
[SPEAKER_13]: Mostly Andrew.

476
00:30:43,832 --> 00:30:46,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's about it.

477
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:49,891
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't do much.

478
00:30:51,472 --> 00:30:53,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, let's hear from some of our guests then, Pixie Dust.

479
00:30:53,934 --> 00:30:55,135
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you've got a lot to say.

480
00:30:55,255 --> 00:30:57,477
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't have my period on my pants.

481
00:30:57,617 --> 00:31:00,079
[SPEAKER_13]: It was peanut butter sauce, god damn it.

482
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,501
[SPEAKER_08]: But before that, how was your week?

483
00:31:02,521 --> 00:31:03,221
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you do this week?

484
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:04,782
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't seen you in like two months.

485
00:31:04,842 --> 00:31:05,223
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.

486
00:31:05,683 --> 00:31:06,504
[SPEAKER_13]: Nothing's gone.

487
00:31:06,524 --> 00:31:07,524
[SPEAKER_08]: You made me sad.

488
00:31:07,905 --> 00:31:08,906
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I didn't.

489
00:31:09,606 --> 00:31:12,388
[SPEAKER_13]: I made you relieved that you didn't have to put up with my period down there.

490
00:31:12,408 --> 00:31:12,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, shut up.

491
00:31:13,349 --> 00:31:14,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, how was your week?

492
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:14,430
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you do?

493
00:31:15,566 --> 00:31:16,587
[SPEAKER_13]: What did I do this week?

494
00:31:18,007 --> 00:31:19,308
[SPEAKER_13]: I fucking don't know.

495
00:31:19,328 --> 00:31:21,209
[SPEAKER_13]: It just went by.

496
00:31:21,469 --> 00:31:23,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Or should I say, who did you do this week?

497
00:31:23,431 --> 00:31:29,554
[SPEAKER_13]: There's this strange guy behind me, and yeah, he's been kissing me all weekend long, so I don't know.

498
00:31:30,595 --> 00:31:32,055
[SPEAKER_13]: I picked him up off the side of the road.

499
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:32,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you?

500
00:31:32,696 --> 00:31:33,556
[SPEAKER_07]: How much did it cost you?

501
00:31:35,698 --> 00:31:36,418
[SPEAKER_13]: You're pretty cheap.

502
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:37,579
[SPEAKER_13]: You're like five cents, right?

503
00:31:39,019 --> 00:31:43,242
[SPEAKER_13]: No, seriously, school, work has like occupied all my time.

504
00:31:43,922 --> 00:31:47,283
[SPEAKER_13]: So I haven't been doing much of anything except been home on the phone.

505
00:31:49,004 --> 00:31:51,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you gotten out to play any Bomani recently or anything?

506
00:31:51,765 --> 00:31:52,045
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

507
00:31:52,325 --> 00:31:54,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you, I haven't, we haven't had you on the show in a long time.

508
00:31:54,987 --> 00:31:57,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you ever pick up Max 2 for the home?

509
00:31:59,408 --> 00:32:00,289
[SPEAKER_13]: No comment on that.

510
00:32:01,329 --> 00:32:01,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

511
00:32:01,969 --> 00:32:03,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of, yeah.

512
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I see a little bitterness there.

513
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:08,232
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a little bitterness towards someone.

514
00:32:08,512 --> 00:32:09,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay, I won't say no more.

515
00:32:09,573 --> 00:32:10,273
[SPEAKER_13]: And you guys all know.

516
00:32:10,453 --> 00:32:11,173
[SPEAKER_13]: I won't say no more.

517
00:32:11,253 --> 00:32:12,634
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, who is it?

518
00:32:13,746 --> 00:32:14,567
[SPEAKER_13]: It's alright.

519
00:32:14,927 --> 00:32:15,888
[SPEAKER_13]: It's you!

520
00:32:16,828 --> 00:32:17,969
[SPEAKER_13]: You bastard!

521
00:32:18,149 --> 00:32:19,010
[SPEAKER_13]: It's alright.

522
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:24,974
[SPEAKER_13]: And, basically, I spotted, this fool came up to see me, so, you know.

523
00:32:26,215 --> 00:32:27,236
[SPEAKER_08]: And you went to Rekikon, yes?

524
00:32:27,396 --> 00:32:28,317
[SPEAKER_13]: And I went to Rekikon.

525
00:32:28,677 --> 00:32:29,658
[SPEAKER_13]: And I called in sick to work.

526
00:32:30,526 --> 00:32:31,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Shame on you.

527
00:32:31,106 --> 00:32:33,007
[SPEAKER_08]: You called in sick to work to go to Rekakon?

528
00:32:33,347 --> 00:32:35,448
[SPEAKER_13]: I called in sick to work because Victor came up.

529
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:36,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I see.

530
00:32:36,769 --> 00:32:38,009
[SPEAKER_13]: Not to see your asses.

531
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I see how it is.

532
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:39,930
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we, no.

533
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:40,810
[SPEAKER_13]: Shut up.

534
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:41,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Bitch, pass that mic.

535
00:32:41,651 --> 00:32:42,311
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just kidding.

536
00:32:42,691 --> 00:32:43,531
[SPEAKER_13]: It's mine now.

537
00:32:43,772 --> 00:32:44,692
[SPEAKER_13]: She almost said what I want.

538
00:32:44,892 --> 00:32:45,452
[SPEAKER_13]: You're an ass.

539
00:32:45,572 --> 00:32:46,052
[SPEAKER_13]: You're an ass.

540
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:49,134
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, it's been good.

541
00:32:49,254 --> 00:32:49,814
[SPEAKER_13]: I miss you, Rob.

542
00:32:50,245 --> 00:32:50,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I missed you too.

543
00:32:51,126 --> 00:32:52,047
[SPEAKER_13]: I missed Loki too.

544
00:32:52,427 --> 00:32:53,468
[SPEAKER_13]: But don't tell Nellie that.

545
00:32:53,669 --> 00:32:55,570
[SPEAKER_08]: The chatroom was reminding me of a good thing.

546
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:59,114
[SPEAKER_08]: The chatroom was reminding me of a good thing that happened at the con.

547
00:32:59,134 --> 00:32:59,775
[SPEAKER_08]: Something kind of funny.

548
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:03,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Richie, EvilMalky2DX, one of the folks at Frigasaur chatroom.

549
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:04,619
[SPEAKER_08]: He caught on fire.

550
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,320
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm kidding.

551
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:05,500
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

552
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:05,881
[SPEAKER_08]: He did not.

553
00:33:06,141 --> 00:33:06,802
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm kidding.

554
00:33:06,862 --> 00:33:07,302
[SPEAKER_08]: God, people.

555
00:33:07,542 --> 00:33:08,163
[SPEAKER_08]: You're gullible.

556
00:33:08,643 --> 00:33:09,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Look up gullible.

557
00:33:09,705 --> 00:33:10,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Oof.

558
00:33:10,709 --> 00:33:13,270
[SPEAKER_08]: He had this sign that said, I like maids.

559
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:16,372
[SPEAKER_08]: When I first saw him there at the con, we were all outside.

560
00:33:16,692 --> 00:33:19,593
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, Richie, I think I saw a maid cosplayer inside.

561
00:33:19,633 --> 00:33:20,914
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was just like, boom!

562
00:33:21,134 --> 00:33:24,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you ever seen one of those Roadrunner cartoons?

563
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:25,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it was you.

564
00:33:25,596 --> 00:33:25,896
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

565
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:26,977
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Magus who said it.

566
00:33:27,077 --> 00:33:27,557
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it.

567
00:33:27,637 --> 00:33:28,037
[SPEAKER_08]: You said it.

568
00:33:28,698 --> 00:33:32,600
[SPEAKER_08]: And have you seen one of those Roadrunner cartoons where it's just like, bing, bing, bing!

569
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,860
[SPEAKER_08]: That was like Richie.

570
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,221
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like, oh, there's a maid cosplayer inside.

571
00:33:36,341 --> 00:33:37,122
[SPEAKER_13]: Bing, bing, bing, bing!

572
00:33:39,036 --> 00:33:39,797
[SPEAKER_13]: No one noticed me.

573
00:33:39,857 --> 00:33:42,319
[SPEAKER_07]: I was surprised.

574
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:44,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know us, we know who you are.

575
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,622
[SPEAKER_07]: But a lot of people don't know who you are.

576
00:33:47,162 --> 00:33:49,304
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't know you're the Orange Lounge, madame.

577
00:33:49,424 --> 00:33:50,164
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I am.

578
00:33:50,184 --> 00:33:51,946
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm the only one with my foot behind my head.

579
00:33:52,306 --> 00:33:53,667
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the only reason they named me that.

580
00:33:55,488 --> 00:33:56,249
[SPEAKER_13]: No one noticed me.

581
00:33:56,289 --> 00:33:57,790
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess I was kind of plain the other day.

582
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything exciting today?

583
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:00,632
[SPEAKER_13]: Hmm.

584
00:34:01,853 --> 00:34:02,193
[SPEAKER_13]: Cake.

585
00:34:02,794 --> 00:34:03,394
[SPEAKER_13]: And fried Twinkies.

586
00:34:06,637 --> 00:34:08,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, no styling.

587
00:34:09,584 --> 00:34:10,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear from no silence.

588
00:34:10,985 --> 00:34:14,326
[SPEAKER_08]: I know he doesn't talk much in person compared to online, but we'll try to get something out of him.

589
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:17,027
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm two different people, you know.

590
00:34:17,067 --> 00:34:17,207
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

591
00:34:17,267 --> 00:34:17,628
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, you're on.

592
00:34:17,668 --> 00:34:20,969
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I'm two different people from like online and, you know, real life.

593
00:34:21,089 --> 00:34:21,569
[SPEAKER_08]: It's okay.

594
00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:23,510
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just making this observation.

595
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:30,193
[SPEAKER_08]: I would be a little scared if you were kind of bouncing off your walls and changing your nickname every five seconds like you do on IRC, but that's okay.

596
00:34:30,933 --> 00:34:32,414
[SPEAKER_15]: Multi-personalities, yeah.

597
00:34:32,474 --> 00:34:32,914
[SPEAKER_15]: It's all good.

598
00:34:33,522 --> 00:34:34,843
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, just talk about Angel, all of you?

599
00:35:02,073 --> 00:35:12,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I realize this is episode 69 and all, but let's not make me barf, okay, from all this lovey-dovey chat, because I'm the only single person in this room right now who's not dating someone else in the room.

600
00:35:13,298 --> 00:35:15,999
[SPEAKER_08]: So I feel really like a seventh wheel right now.

601
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:16,659
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I'll tell you this.

602
00:35:18,139 --> 00:35:27,223
[SPEAKER_15]: Coming back from Hollywood Video, first time coming to Sacramento and everything, and whoever designs these layouts for these stores and malls, you know,

603
00:35:28,908 --> 00:35:32,071
[SPEAKER_15]: This huge rock, I ran over this rock and I was clinging like in mid-air.

604
00:35:32,211 --> 00:35:32,931
[SPEAKER_15]: It was hilarious.

605
00:35:33,812 --> 00:35:34,973
[SPEAKER_13]: We were like hovering.

606
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,234
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god, a rock.

607
00:35:37,655 --> 00:35:42,078
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, I was on the passenger side and I was like, what the fuck did you hit?

608
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,860
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought it was a fire hydrant.

609
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,601
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, well that was an interesting part.

610
00:35:45,701 --> 00:35:46,962
[SPEAKER_13]: But it was like, oh shit.

611
00:35:50,545 --> 00:35:51,766
[SPEAKER_13]: So, that was interesting.

612
00:35:51,806 --> 00:35:52,566
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'm taking your time.

613
00:35:52,827 --> 00:35:53,247
[SPEAKER_15]: That's cool.

614
00:35:53,787 --> 00:35:54,828
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's pretty much my day.

615
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:55,869
[SPEAKER_15]: Or week.

616
00:35:56,289 --> 00:35:57,010
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, alright.

617
00:35:59,484 --> 00:36:01,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Angel, how was your week?

618
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:01,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Rob.

619
00:36:01,825 --> 00:36:02,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, how are you?

620
00:36:02,905 --> 00:36:03,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.

621
00:36:03,645 --> 00:36:06,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Didn't your local Scandia get a new Bomani game recently?

622
00:36:08,407 --> 00:36:09,027
[SPEAKER_14]: Percussion Freaks.

623
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:10,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Percussion Freaks.

624
00:36:10,267 --> 00:36:11,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, not Drum Freaks, but Percussion Freaks.

625
00:36:11,647 --> 00:36:13,428
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's Drum Mania, but I mean, it's Drum Mania.

626
00:36:13,468 --> 00:36:17,189
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, but it's a different name, so that makes it worth talking about.

627
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:22,710
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I suppose it's a different name, except for the fact that it still says Drum Mania on the stupid machine.

628
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:23,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you gotten a chance to play it at all?

629
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:24,491
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

630
00:36:24,511 --> 00:36:25,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, well then fuck it.

631
00:36:25,591 --> 00:36:26,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us about your week.

632
00:36:28,762 --> 00:36:30,343
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, let's see.

633
00:36:31,704 --> 00:36:38,188
[SPEAKER_14]: I pretty much worked all week except for like school on Thursday, which I was sick for, so I didn't go, but that's okay.

634
00:36:38,769 --> 00:36:42,351
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, then I just pretty much waited out the rest of the week until I got here.

635
00:36:43,792 --> 00:36:44,233
[SPEAKER_14]: So yay.

636
00:36:47,115 --> 00:36:47,435
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.

637
00:36:48,636 --> 00:36:49,756
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to be boring now.

638
00:36:51,438 --> 00:36:55,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Boring and monotoned and meh.

639
00:36:57,165 --> 00:36:58,266
[SPEAKER_14]: Pie!

640
00:37:00,368 --> 00:37:01,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Mmm, pie.

641
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:06,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Andrew, the 69th Magus, how was your week, how was your day?

642
00:37:08,254 --> 00:37:12,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, week, long and hard, like, never mind.

643
00:37:12,957 --> 00:37:15,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, over.

644
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:18,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Over.

645
00:37:18,622 --> 00:37:22,565
[SPEAKER_06]: But, uh, kind of went through the motions of

646
00:37:23,211 --> 00:37:40,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Just going to school, just, yes, I'm making all these terrible puns, and just went to school, went home, went to school, went home, went to school, went home, went to school, went home, all week, and finally, Saturday rolled around, went to Rekticon, and wee, fun.

647
00:37:42,322 --> 00:37:47,585
[SPEAKER_05]: So, rest of the week was boring, weekend is just all hyper and happy and shit.

648
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:54,645
[SPEAKER_14]: If I hear the 5678 song one more time, I swear to... Oh, shit.

649
00:37:57,908 --> 00:37:59,110
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not twisted earth.

650
00:38:03,854 --> 00:38:06,336
[SPEAKER_08]: You should see... Nellie, you should see what else I can whistle.

651
00:38:08,018 --> 00:38:08,818
You blow well.

652
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,202
[SPEAKER_08]: I can blow these lips very well, Nellie.

653
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:23,335
[SPEAKER_15]: He's quite talented at the meat flute.

654
00:38:23,495 --> 00:38:27,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we're going to take a break and when we come back we'll talk about some more Barmani.

655
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:31,182
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we will have ourselves a cage match.

656
00:38:32,023 --> 00:38:35,666
[SPEAKER_08]: But the rules for the cage match tonight are a little bit different.

657
00:38:35,906 --> 00:38:38,608
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll be in the cage actually dancing topless.

658
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:42,932
[SPEAKER_08]: So stay tuned for that because we're going to have ourselves a cage match when we come back.

659
00:38:43,592 --> 00:38:45,514
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll talk about a whole bunch of other stuff too.

660
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:49,453
[SPEAKER_08]: This break we're going to do a segment of a bunch of Mr. T songs.

661
00:38:49,733 --> 00:38:51,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Mr. T rocks.

662
00:38:51,634 --> 00:38:53,675
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not talking about I pity the fool.

663
00:38:53,695 --> 00:38:55,936
[SPEAKER_13]: I pity the fool who takes my gold chain.

664
00:38:55,996 --> 00:38:58,897
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm talking about that other Mr. T. The one that we all know from Bomani.

665
00:38:58,917 --> 00:38:59,317
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back.

666
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:45,141
Thanks for watching!

667
00:43:59,795 --> 00:44:04,579
[SPEAKER_11]: From the Setsquad to Orange Labs, this PDR sucks!

668
00:44:04,939 --> 00:44:05,259
[SPEAKER_11]: Holla!

669
00:44:05,419 --> 00:44:05,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Suck!

670
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Suck!

671
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:06,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Suck!

672
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:06,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Suck!

673
00:44:06,821 --> 00:44:07,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Suck!

674
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:07,181
[SPEAKER_11]: Suck!

675
00:44:07,201 --> 00:44:07,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Suck!

676
00:44:19,833 --> 00:44:25,177
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, alright, we're back and you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 69.

677
00:44:26,398 --> 00:44:31,502
[SPEAKER_08]: And as promised, we're going to get into a cage match here very shortly, but I thought this was worth talking about this week.

678
00:44:31,962 --> 00:44:34,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, I know you've been somewhat involved in this.

679
00:44:35,325 --> 00:44:37,666
[SPEAKER_08]: There's been this movement going on lately.

680
00:44:37,886 --> 00:44:45,192
[SPEAKER_08]: MTV is holding this contest and they are naming the best game of the millennium.

681
00:44:46,633 --> 00:44:51,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, of course, we're only three years into the millennium, but they're going to name the best game of the whole damn millennium anyway.

682
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:53,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Up for nomination?

683
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:54,559
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR.

684
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:56,701
[SPEAKER_08]: This is MTV and Electronic Gaming Monthly.

685
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:57,741
[SPEAKER_15]: Milkshake.

686
00:44:58,062 --> 00:44:59,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Also up for nomination?

687
00:45:00,043 --> 00:45:00,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Halo.

688
00:45:01,364 --> 00:45:04,827
[SPEAKER_08]: The Final Fantasy series, the Super Mario series, yada, yada, yada.

689
00:45:04,907 --> 00:45:10,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, tell us more about what's been going on, trying to flood the channels with votes for DDR.

690
00:45:11,636 --> 00:45:12,537
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really stupid.

691
00:45:13,237 --> 00:45:20,903
[SPEAKER_08]: MTV is really genius, and they allowed people to vote more than once for their game.

692
00:45:21,603 --> 00:45:28,028
[SPEAKER_08]: So obviously that opens it up for, hey, let's make a script, and I'm going to go ahead and vote for my game millions of times.

693
00:45:28,488 --> 00:45:32,651
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's what everyone did, at least the people that are voting for Halo and DDR.

694
00:45:33,372 --> 00:45:40,097
[SPEAKER_08]: So this went on for like two days, and then finally MTV closed their polls, and they were like, okay, find out the results on January 2nd.

695
00:45:41,636 --> 00:45:44,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so that... And we thought, okay, they're done.

696
00:45:44,478 --> 00:45:47,980
[SPEAKER_08]: So pretty much, you know, Halo and DDR are going to win, you know, according to that.

697
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,241
[SPEAKER_08]: And DDR was in the lead.

698
00:45:49,961 --> 00:45:52,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Then for some reason, people thought you could still vote after the polls closed.

699
00:45:52,803 --> 00:45:54,784
[SPEAKER_08]: So they kept doing it, and doing it, and doing it.

700
00:45:54,824 --> 00:46:07,171
[SPEAKER_08]: And finally, they opened the polls again, supposedly changing their script, or their, like, webpage or whatever, their submission thing, so that you can't, you know, do this multiple voting thing, yet it's still getting through.

701
00:46:07,672 --> 00:46:07,772
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

702
00:46:08,237 --> 00:46:08,697
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

703
00:46:31,233 --> 00:46:32,154
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

704
00:46:55,668 --> 00:47:02,154
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't like a program, but it was a web page that would refresh like 10 frames over and over again with the voting page.

705
00:47:02,595 --> 00:47:06,398
[SPEAKER_08]: And we had this artist up to 98% of the vote for the Viewer's Choice Award.

706
00:47:06,759 --> 00:47:15,407
[SPEAKER_08]: And the day of the MTV Awards, they posted a message on there that said, Well, this person won the web vote, but we're only going to count the phone votes for the real award.

707
00:47:15,427 --> 00:47:16,808
[SPEAKER_08]: So stay tuned tonight and see who wins.

708
00:47:17,069 --> 00:47:18,190
[SPEAKER_08]: And a completely different person won.

709
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,051
[SPEAKER_08]: So MTV, you know what?

710
00:47:20,131 --> 00:47:22,113
[SPEAKER_08]: If they want to just throw out the web votes, they'll do it.

711
00:47:22,193 --> 00:47:27,537
[SPEAKER_08]: And what they're going to do is they're going to keep all the advertising dollars for all those banners that loaded.

712
00:47:27,557 --> 00:47:28,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Because think of it.

713
00:47:28,918 --> 00:47:31,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Every time you refresh that page, that's like three more banners.

714
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:34,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Because MTV.com is full of logos.

715
00:47:34,522 --> 00:47:35,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Three more banners that load.

716
00:47:35,723 --> 00:47:41,528
[SPEAKER_08]: So you vote a million times, you're giving MTV $1,000 from all that refreshing.

717
00:47:42,108 --> 00:47:43,689
[SPEAKER_08]: So kind of something to think about.

718
00:47:43,769 --> 00:47:44,910
[SPEAKER_08]: At least that's the way I look at it.

719
00:47:46,331 --> 00:47:47,072
[SPEAKER_08]: You have something to say, Pixies?

720
00:47:47,092 --> 00:47:47,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

721
00:47:48,183 --> 00:47:50,604
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you want to know something more pathetic than that?

722
00:47:51,444 --> 00:47:57,966
[SPEAKER_13]: The search for Miss Applebottom on VH1, where they're searching for the woman with the perfect butt.

723
00:47:58,866 --> 00:48:03,268
[SPEAKER_13]: And the choice host of that is Nelly.

724
00:48:04,688 --> 00:48:05,108
[SPEAKER_08]: This Nelly?

725
00:48:05,128 --> 00:48:06,028
[SPEAKER_13]: Not this Nelly.

726
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,209
[SPEAKER_13]: Nelly with the band-aid.

727
00:48:08,249 --> 00:48:08,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, boy.

728
00:48:08,849 --> 00:48:10,590
[SPEAKER_08]: It's getting hot in here.

729
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:11,490
[SPEAKER_13]: It's so pathetic.

730
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:14,831
[SPEAKER_13]: There was nothing but big booty black girls and adult models there.

731
00:48:16,548 --> 00:48:18,210
[SPEAKER_13]: I can make it clap!

732
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,752
[SPEAKER_13]: Look, I do not want to hear about your twat clapping, okay?

733
00:48:20,872 --> 00:48:22,813
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have thought J-Lo would have been a judge on that show.

734
00:48:24,175 --> 00:48:25,556
[SPEAKER_08]: She has the queen of all butts.

735
00:48:26,677 --> 00:48:28,038
[SPEAKER_08]: I have the king, she has the queen.

736
00:48:29,259 --> 00:48:30,800
[SPEAKER_08]: I literally have a king-sized butt.

737
00:48:32,441 --> 00:48:33,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you the flying duchess?

738
00:48:34,403 --> 00:48:35,784
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, because it's so wide.

739
00:48:36,164 --> 00:48:38,987
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, I like Sarah Ferguson, I have like a wide ass.

740
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:40,628
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

741
00:48:40,768 --> 00:48:42,690
[SPEAKER_08]: I like how you throw that, unlike Sarah Ferguson.

742
00:48:44,577 --> 00:48:48,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know what's weird is that they're going to be doing that Partridge Family redo pretty soon, too.

743
00:48:49,075 --> 00:48:49,276
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean...

744
00:48:50,368 --> 00:48:52,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Mavis, aren't you in that?

745
00:48:53,749 --> 00:48:57,311
[SPEAKER_08]: VH1 is a network I'll watch occasionally because they actually play some good videos.

746
00:48:57,391 --> 00:48:59,832
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, this is how I know I'm getting old.

747
00:49:00,132 --> 00:49:01,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I prefer VH1 to MTV.

748
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:05,054
[SPEAKER_08]: The music on MTV I don't like as much as I like the music on VH1.

749
00:49:05,094 --> 00:49:06,374
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, oh God, am I getting old?

750
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:15,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I prefer the station that plays things like, you know, that kind of skew a little bit older, like Sting and Coldplay and Sarah McLachlan.

751
00:49:15,818 --> 00:49:17,458
[SPEAKER_08]: And bands that don't play on MTV a lot.

752
00:49:17,498 --> 00:49:18,679
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, am I getting old?

753
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:22,186
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is kind of one reason I don't care about the MTV polls.

754
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:23,887
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't watch MTV, so I care less who wins.

755
00:49:24,267 --> 00:49:32,271
[SPEAKER_08]: But word has come from some of the folks from Team Seattle that MTV was actually out there in Seattle filming some stuff just in case.

756
00:49:32,732 --> 00:49:37,574
[SPEAKER_08]: So if DDR does win, you can expect to see some massive bar raping on MTV.

757
00:49:37,694 --> 00:49:38,134
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just kidding.

758
00:49:38,154 --> 00:49:38,815
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kidding.

759
00:49:38,835 --> 00:49:40,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Much love for Seattle.

760
00:49:44,505 --> 00:49:46,607
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just, either way, it's going to happen.

761
00:49:46,687 --> 00:49:47,708
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going to be sad.

762
00:49:48,189 --> 00:49:51,552
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, I'm almost willing to bet Microsoft's going to win.

763
00:49:51,712 --> 00:49:52,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you know what?

764
00:49:52,473 --> 00:49:56,137
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be willing to bet that Grand Theft Auto Vice City wins, no matter what.

765
00:49:56,826 --> 00:50:00,289
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the thing, because it's trendy to like a Grand Theft Auto by Cindy.

766
00:50:00,309 --> 00:50:10,416
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be like avant-garde for MTV to give the award, because we're going to give the award to a controversial game where you shoot hookers, where you fuck the women and then blow their heads off.

767
00:50:11,316 --> 00:50:12,817
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be the best game of the millennium.

768
00:50:12,857 --> 00:50:14,779
[SPEAKER_08]: That sums up 2003 right there.

769
00:50:15,099 --> 00:50:15,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Grand Theft Auto 3.

770
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:20,583
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just going to be so retarded.

771
00:50:23,605 --> 00:50:24,586
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't like MTV.

772
00:50:27,045 --> 00:50:27,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

773
00:50:43,919 --> 00:50:49,921
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, the exposure of DDR to anybody on MTV was that stupid fucking Wade Robson commercial.

774
00:50:50,302 --> 00:50:51,562
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all they fucking know.

775
00:50:51,942 --> 00:50:57,224
[SPEAKER_13]: All they know is Afro Man and fucking all his stupid shit like, Oh, you have to go up and do it and do the side.

776
00:50:57,664 --> 00:50:57,825
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh!

777
00:50:58,605 --> 00:51:01,126
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, I don't want DDR on MTV.

778
00:51:01,246 --> 00:51:02,726
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want those people playing my game.

779
00:51:03,587 --> 00:51:04,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Stay off my dance pad.

780
00:51:05,428 --> 00:51:05,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Get off.

781
00:51:06,848 --> 00:51:07,949
[SPEAKER_13]: Like those little girls that come in.

782
00:51:07,969 --> 00:51:10,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, the new thing is going to be Karaoke Revolution.

783
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:11,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's...

784
00:51:12,338 --> 00:51:13,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Goodie fucking goodie.

785
00:51:14,179 --> 00:51:15,339
[SPEAKER_08]: No style in that something he wants to say?

786
00:51:18,781 --> 00:51:19,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, no.

787
00:51:20,902 --> 00:51:22,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well don't tease me like that.

788
00:51:23,243 --> 00:51:23,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Um.

789
00:51:24,703 --> 00:51:26,384
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, but Rob, you love to be teased.

790
00:51:26,404 --> 00:51:27,645
[SPEAKER_08]: I do love to be teased.

791
00:51:28,245 --> 00:51:28,405
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.

792
00:51:28,805 --> 00:51:33,207
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll talk a little more about Karaoke Revolution and things like that after this cage match we're going to have.

793
00:51:33,587 --> 00:51:36,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, as I promised, tonight is a little different of a cage match.

794
00:51:37,409 --> 00:51:39,470
[SPEAKER_08]: And because it's a different cage match, we have different music.

795
00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:42,512
[SPEAKER_08]: I just like to hear y'all mocha.

796
00:51:44,254 --> 00:51:48,238
[SPEAKER_08]: So, tonight we are having what's called a reverse cage match.

797
00:51:48,918 --> 00:52:00,409
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason why we're having a reverse cage match tonight is because Jamie left for Alabama and assumed that her song would win for two more weeks and forgot to give me... No, I think she just forgot because she was really busy packing everything.

798
00:52:00,769 --> 00:52:02,551
[SPEAKER_08]: She forgot to give me two more songs for cage match.

799
00:52:03,138 --> 00:52:05,280
[SPEAKER_08]: or if she told me, I've forgotten, it's my bad.

800
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:19,070
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we've decided we'd do tonight is we'd table the cage match, because we all know Loki's song probably would have won again anyway, because he won last week with Battle Without Honor or Humanity, the 88-7 Lens Mix, which we'll play later in the show for those who... Oh shit, no I don't.

801
00:52:20,251 --> 00:52:23,213
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess we won't be playing it later in the show, because I don't have the mp3 of it.

802
00:52:23,293 --> 00:52:23,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob?

803
00:52:23,734 --> 00:52:23,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes?

804
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,095
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, it's a cheeseburger!

805
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:30,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I guess I can't play because I don't have the MP3 of it.

806
00:52:30,738 --> 00:52:36,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless somebody in the chatroom I sent it to can send it back to me because it was on Loki's old computer, which is not operative right now.

807
00:52:37,225 --> 00:52:41,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, tonight in the reverse cage match, this is what's going to happen.

808
00:52:42,401 --> 00:52:49,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki and I, between, we're each going to put in two songs that we believe are some of the worst things we've ever heard.

809
00:52:49,545 --> 00:52:53,747
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're going to be Bomani or Dance Mania related in some way.

810
00:52:54,127 --> 00:52:57,309
[SPEAKER_08]: And you guys will vote for the absolute worst song that you heard.

811
00:52:58,189 --> 00:53:02,732
[SPEAKER_08]: And the loser will be banned from Orange Lounge Radio indefinitely.

812
00:53:02,772 --> 00:53:05,733
[SPEAKER_08]: You will never hear this song on the station ever again.

813
00:53:06,033 --> 00:53:06,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Ever.

814
00:53:07,014 --> 00:53:08,174
[SPEAKER_08]: We will ban the song.

815
00:53:08,275 --> 00:53:08,875
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gone.

816
00:53:10,131 --> 00:53:16,799
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so Loki and I are going to pick two songs each, so you're going to vote for the song you hate the most, the song you want to leave tonight.

817
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,942
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so that's the reverse cage match.

818
00:53:19,962 --> 00:53:24,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of picking a song to win and be in rotation all week long, you're going to pick for a song to lose and be banned indefinitely.

819
00:53:25,768 --> 00:53:31,475
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so first up is going to be my first pick, and it's actually a song from Dancing Stage Fever.

820
00:53:32,395 --> 00:53:33,036
[SPEAKER_08]: How exciting!

821
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:35,678
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a song that you can actually dance to in Dancing Stage Fever.

822
00:53:35,738 --> 00:53:40,924
[SPEAKER_08]: So even if it gets banned from the station indefinitely, you'll still be able to play it if you really, really want to.

823
00:53:42,105 --> 00:53:45,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's my pick for tonight's reverse cage match to ban from the station.

824
00:53:45,648 --> 00:53:47,450
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the Spice Girls with Wannabe.

825
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:48,031
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy!

826
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:24,851
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want my future, forget my past If you wanna get with me, better make it fast Now don't go wasting my precious time Get your act together, we could be just fine I'll tell you what I want, what I really, really want Don't tell me what you want, what you really, really want

827
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:49,295
[SPEAKER_11]: If you wanna be my lover You gotta get with my friends Make it last forever Friendship never ends If you wanna be my lover You have got to give Thinking is too easy But that's the way it is If you wanna be my lover You gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta Make it last forever Somebody's got a mind It's all about Somebody's got a mind

828
00:55:00,613 --> 00:55:23,499
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, that was song number one in tonight's reverse cage match for worst song ever to be banned from the station.

829
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:28,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Spice Girls was one of the... Let's go around and see what people thought of that and rate it on a scale of one to ten.

830
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:29,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Pixie Dust.

831
00:55:30,282 --> 00:55:36,707
[SPEAKER_13]: All I gotta say is, I have Scary Spice hair, so I love that song.

832
00:55:37,347 --> 00:55:37,788
[SPEAKER_13]: Dammit.

833
00:55:38,228 --> 00:55:40,330
[SPEAKER_13]: Reminds me of my youth, you fuckface.

834
00:55:41,631 --> 00:55:42,231
[SPEAKER_13]: Dammit!

835
00:55:43,572 --> 00:55:44,613
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck you.

836
00:55:44,793 --> 00:55:45,894
[SPEAKER_13]: I want that song.

837
00:55:46,054 --> 00:55:47,255
[SPEAKER_13]: My favorite song's still one.

838
00:55:48,135 --> 00:55:50,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if you give it a one, that means you think it's bad.

839
00:55:50,337 --> 00:55:51,098
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I'll give it a ten!

840
00:55:51,678 --> 00:55:51,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

841
00:55:51,978 --> 00:55:53,279
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought we were doing it in reverse.

842
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:54,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

843
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:54,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

844
00:55:55,146 --> 00:55:56,267
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought you were doing it in reverse.

845
00:55:56,347 --> 00:55:59,108
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you still vote on 1 to 10, 10 being good, 1 being bad.

846
00:55:59,128 --> 00:55:59,808
[SPEAKER_08]: So you give it a 10?

847
00:56:00,388 --> 00:56:03,530
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not as good as some Spice Girls songs, but, you know, well.

848
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:03,910
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

849
00:56:05,031 --> 00:56:05,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Angel.

850
00:56:07,512 --> 00:56:08,072
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Rob?

851
00:56:08,432 --> 00:56:08,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

852
00:56:10,293 --> 00:56:15,535
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, well, yeah, I guess old school or something.

853
00:56:15,555 --> 00:56:18,737
[SPEAKER_14]: Not really old school, but something from my childhood or whatever.

854
00:56:19,117 --> 00:56:19,917
[SPEAKER_14]: Teenage years.

855
00:56:20,698 --> 00:56:22,739
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, it's okay.

856
00:56:22,859 --> 00:56:23,259
[SPEAKER_14]: They're just...

857
00:56:23,931 --> 00:56:24,712
[SPEAKER_14]: There, okay?

858
00:56:24,952 --> 00:56:26,053
[SPEAKER_14]: Specials are just there.

859
00:56:26,413 --> 00:56:26,733
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever.

860
00:56:26,793 --> 00:56:27,073
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

861
00:56:28,574 --> 00:56:29,435
[SPEAKER_14]: Hell, six.

862
00:56:29,955 --> 00:56:30,395
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

863
00:56:30,436 --> 00:56:32,177
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I didn't like them anyway.

864
00:56:32,457 --> 00:56:33,217
[SPEAKER_14]: No styling.

865
00:56:33,518 --> 00:56:36,099
[SPEAKER_18]: No styling.

866
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:41,723
[SPEAKER_15]: I really liked the Spice Girls when I was young and everything, but... Yeah, yeah, I know.

867
00:56:41,863 --> 00:56:43,625
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a high school film, but I give it a four.

868
00:56:45,045 --> 00:56:45,706
Alright.

869
00:56:45,746 --> 00:56:46,126
Magus.

870
00:56:46,146 --> 00:56:46,506
Magus.

871
00:56:52,287 --> 00:56:53,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I think J.K.

872
00:56:53,027 --> 00:57:01,272
[SPEAKER_06]: in the chatroom said it best when he said that he'd like to bang about three out of five of them, but he'd rather they keep the dick in their mouth so he doesn't have to hear them.

873
00:57:02,173 --> 00:57:03,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Zero!

874
00:57:03,694 --> 00:57:04,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye-bye!

875
00:57:05,135 --> 00:57:05,515
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

876
00:57:07,536 --> 00:57:07,696
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

877
00:57:09,037 --> 00:57:10,578
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a zing for him, not for me.

878
00:57:10,658 --> 00:57:13,380
[SPEAKER_08]: My vote is be glad it wasn't Spice Up Your Life, okay?

879
00:57:14,179 --> 00:57:15,079
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that whole song.

880
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:16,100
[SPEAKER_08]: So I give it a two.

881
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,360
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that whole song, and I love that whole song.

882
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:24,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Up next, Loki, your first pick, because we're each putting in two songs tonight because Jamie's not here, so we're going to have four songs to pick from.

883
00:57:24,382 --> 00:57:28,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, what's your first song tonight that you're going to nominate to be banned from Orange Lounge forever?

884
00:57:29,929 --> 00:57:31,549
[SPEAKER_08]: This song is like the worst song ever.

885
00:57:31,569 --> 00:57:33,330
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys seem to like it, so you know what?

886
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:34,290
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope it's gone.

887
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:35,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Leave.

888
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:36,290
[SPEAKER_03]: It's done.

889
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:37,770
[SPEAKER_03]: This is lame.

890
00:57:38,451 --> 00:57:40,091
[SPEAKER_03]: I give you fucking Holic.

891
00:57:40,411 --> 00:57:41,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Vote for Holic, you bitch.

892
00:57:41,971 --> 00:57:43,212
[SPEAKER_03]: You fucking bitch and whiny.

893
00:57:43,232 --> 00:57:44,212
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't vote for Holic.

894
00:57:44,572 --> 00:57:46,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Vote for it now.

895
00:57:47,192 --> 00:57:55,014
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so Loki is putting in Holic to be banned from the station forever because he's sick of people trying to vote for it in the cage match.

896
00:57:55,414 --> 00:57:56,094
[SPEAKER_08]: So here we go.

897
00:57:57,024 --> 00:57:58,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Song number two to be banned tonight.

898
00:57:58,413 --> 00:57:59,561
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Tack with Holic.

899
00:59:24,622 --> 00:59:28,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that was song number two to be voted for eviction from Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

900
00:59:28,243 --> 00:59:38,526
[SPEAKER_08]: That was Tack with Holic, and Loki's trying to be cute because everybody always votes for Holic in our cage matches, so he just wants that song off the station so people don't try to vote for that shit anymore.

901
00:59:38,926 --> 00:59:40,386
[SPEAKER_08]: But you guys, here's your say.

902
00:59:40,406 --> 00:59:41,786
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think of Tack with Holic?

903
00:59:42,887 --> 00:59:44,687
[SPEAKER_13]: It's Tack, it's Holic, it's holorific.

904
00:59:45,367 --> 00:59:45,847
[SPEAKER_08]: One to ten.

905
00:59:48,965 --> 00:59:50,206
[SPEAKER_14]: Just for Jamie, I'd give it a 10.

906
00:59:50,426 --> 00:59:51,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Angel.

907
00:59:51,586 --> 00:59:52,987
[SPEAKER_14]: It's tackified, it has to stay 10.

908
00:59:53,247 --> 00:59:54,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, no styling.

909
00:59:54,768 --> 01:00:00,291
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I'd give it a nice 10.

910
01:00:00,611 --> 01:00:00,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

911
01:00:01,691 --> 01:00:02,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Magus.

912
01:00:02,372 --> 01:00:03,752
[SPEAKER_08]: It's tack, need I say more?

913
01:00:03,772 --> 01:00:03,752
10.

914
01:00:04,093 --> 01:00:05,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

915
01:00:07,154 --> 01:00:08,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Run, because it sucks.

916
01:00:09,395 --> 01:00:11,396
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same damn song over and over again.

917
01:00:11,416 --> 01:00:12,957
[SPEAKER_03]: He thought he was all cool by, you know...

918
01:00:13,632 --> 01:00:16,034
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing it in 7, 4, you know, measures, whatever.

919
01:00:16,054 --> 01:00:16,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Sucks.

920
01:00:17,455 --> 01:00:17,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Lame.

921
01:00:18,036 --> 01:00:18,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Lame song.

922
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:20,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds like every single other song is done.

923
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:23,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

924
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:25,762
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give you the one already.

925
01:00:26,082 --> 01:00:26,462
[SPEAKER_08]: I give it a 9.

926
01:00:27,723 --> 01:00:29,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm just not going to give it a 10.

927
01:00:29,465 --> 01:00:30,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm just that big of a prick.

928
01:00:31,726 --> 01:00:32,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

929
01:00:33,067 --> 01:00:36,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Song number 3 tonight is my pick, and it's a Dance Mania pick.

930
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:39,252
[SPEAKER_08]: This comes from Dance Mania EX1.

931
01:00:39,973 --> 01:00:41,034
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a cover song.

932
01:00:42,203 --> 01:00:45,747
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a cover of a song that was really famous because it was in a movie once.

933
01:00:46,928 --> 01:00:49,551
[SPEAKER_08]: And the name of the group that covers it is called Bushida.

934
01:00:50,412 --> 01:00:53,295
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is their cover of My Heart Will Go On.

935
01:00:53,535 --> 01:00:54,796
[SPEAKER_08]: My pick for tonight.

936
01:00:55,257 --> 01:00:55,777
[SPEAKER_08]: One!

937
01:00:55,878 --> 01:00:56,478
[SPEAKER_08]: One!

938
01:00:56,578 --> 01:00:56,738
[SPEAKER_08]: One!

939
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,099
[SPEAKER_11]: One!

940
01:00:57,339 --> 01:00:58,640
[SPEAKER_08]: My Heart Will Go On.

941
01:00:59,241 --> 01:00:59,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy.

942
01:01:20,227 --> 01:01:20,888
Thanks for watching!

943
01:03:04,156 --> 01:03:08,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I decided to save you by only playing half of that, because it goes on for four minutes.

944
01:03:08,178 --> 01:03:12,721
[SPEAKER_08]: That was My Heart Will Go On, by... I don't even remember the name of it.

945
01:03:12,761 --> 01:03:16,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Originally by Celine Dion, but on Dance Mania EX1, that was by Bushida.

946
01:03:16,483 --> 01:03:20,065
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, not EX1, Dance Mania X1, that's by Bushida.

947
01:03:20,105 --> 01:03:21,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Your guys' thoughts, Pixie Dust.

948
01:03:22,447 --> 01:03:26,289
[SPEAKER_13]: It's covered of Celine Dion.

949
01:03:26,709 --> 01:03:29,551
[SPEAKER_13]: It made me fucking die!

950
01:03:30,251 --> 01:03:31,072
[SPEAKER_13]: Bastard!

951
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:35,998
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate playing Neon, so... I'll give this a zero on my list.

952
01:03:36,498 --> 01:03:38,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Angel.

953
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:39,700
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, no.

954
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:40,241
[SPEAKER_14]: Die.

955
01:03:40,501 --> 01:03:40,641
[SPEAKER_14]: One.

956
01:03:41,462 --> 01:03:42,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, no Skyland.

957
01:03:44,884 --> 01:03:46,545
[SPEAKER_15]: I give it a zero.

958
01:03:46,585 --> 01:03:47,226
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, 0.1.

959
01:03:47,286 --> 01:03:48,547
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't like this song at all.

960
01:03:49,708 --> 01:03:50,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Magus.

961
01:03:51,289 --> 01:03:51,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Zero.

962
01:03:51,829 --> 01:03:52,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Goodbye!

963
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:54,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Loki.

964
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:58,413
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets a ten because that movie was so sad.

965
01:03:58,954 --> 01:04:00,014
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

966
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:06,178
[SPEAKER_03]: He's so gone and she's so sad because her love died and became a popsicle.

967
01:04:14,343 --> 01:04:22,789
[SPEAKER_25]: I am the world's greatest singer and I give my song a ten because I have six crannies and you have none.

968
01:04:26,282 --> 01:04:28,183
[SPEAKER_13]: Next thing you know, it's Lane Dion Hot Pockets.

969
01:04:28,483 --> 01:04:28,824
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

970
01:04:29,384 --> 01:04:32,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, the final pick in tonight's reverse cage match.

971
01:04:32,327 --> 01:04:34,629
[SPEAKER_08]: For song to be banned from Orange Lounge forever, what's your pick?

972
01:04:34,649 --> 01:04:41,695
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, they saved my other song from being put in here, because it probably would have gotten voted off, and now you'd be subjected to it even more.

973
01:04:42,496 --> 01:04:45,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the song I was going to pick was Eddie Murphy, Party All the Time, but...

974
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:47,481
[SPEAKER_08]: We like that song.

975
01:04:47,521 --> 01:04:57,031
[SPEAKER_03]: So instead, we've got Nancy and the Boys, a wonderful speed group who sucks because it's speed music, doing Complicated.

976
01:04:57,391 --> 01:04:58,192
[SPEAKER_08]: So eat this.

977
01:04:59,694 --> 01:05:03,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, from Speed 10, this is Nancy and the Boys with Complicated.

978
01:05:03,417 --> 01:05:03,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy.

979
01:05:03,557 --> 01:05:03,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy.

980
01:05:58,124 --> 01:05:59,685
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

981
01:07:18,394 --> 01:07:21,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, I'm so glad we did this tonight.

982
01:07:22,077 --> 01:07:25,640
[SPEAKER_08]: The chatroom reactions to these songs are fucking priceless.

983
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:26,381
[SPEAKER_08]: This is great.

984
01:07:26,401 --> 01:07:27,441
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to do this again.

985
01:07:28,682 --> 01:07:31,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Such classic lines as, she sounds like a meth addict.

986
01:07:33,889 --> 01:07:35,671
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard that when I was over at Garrett's house when he first got C-10.

987
01:07:35,691 --> 01:07:39,254
[SPEAKER_08]: We just rolled on the floor laughing from that crap.

988
01:07:39,274 --> 01:07:41,877
[SPEAKER_08]: It's unfortunately better than Avril, but, you know.

989
01:08:00,365 --> 01:08:07,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Who the fuck either turned up or changed the speed on the record player to where it's like, or just, who scratched it by Avril Lavigne CD?

990
01:08:07,569 --> 01:08:08,129
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, mine?

991
01:08:08,149 --> 01:08:08,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it was Pixie's.

992
01:08:26,184 --> 01:08:26,845
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck you.

993
01:08:27,165 --> 01:08:28,446
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have Avril.

994
01:08:28,846 --> 01:08:30,668
[SPEAKER_13]: I have fucking Nancy in the voice.

995
01:08:30,708 --> 01:08:31,709
[SPEAKER_13]: Get it right, bitch.

996
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:34,231
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

997
01:08:34,331 --> 01:08:35,892
[SPEAKER_08]: On a scale of one to ten.

998
01:08:36,452 --> 01:08:36,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Angel.

999
01:08:37,193 --> 01:08:37,553
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah.

1000
01:08:37,633 --> 01:08:37,894
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

1001
01:08:38,794 --> 01:08:40,275
[SPEAKER_08]: One being low and ten being high.

1002
01:08:41,276 --> 01:08:42,057
[SPEAKER_14]: One, bitch.

1003
01:08:42,557 --> 01:08:43,118
[SPEAKER_08]: No styling.

1004
01:08:43,158 --> 01:08:44,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Your thoughts on Nancy in the voice.

1005
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:47,361
[SPEAKER_15]: My thoughts and thoughts is too fast and it sounds like, you know, Disney World or whatever.

1006
01:08:47,461 --> 01:08:48,102
[SPEAKER_15]: I give it a one.

1007
01:08:48,442 --> 01:08:48,722
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1008
01:08:48,882 --> 01:08:49,963
[SPEAKER_08]: One.

1009
01:08:50,023 --> 01:08:50,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Magus.

1010
01:08:52,365 --> 01:08:52,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Guy.

1011
01:08:53,706 --> 01:08:54,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Zero.

1012
01:08:55,228 --> 01:08:55,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

1013
01:08:55,448 --> 01:08:55,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Zero.

1014
01:08:57,272 --> 01:08:58,033
[SPEAKER_03]: I give it a 2.

1015
01:08:58,193 --> 01:09:03,215
[SPEAKER_03]: The song almost killed Andrew over there, so it's got some power to it.

1016
01:09:06,176 --> 01:09:08,537
[SPEAKER_08]: I give this song a 10, and I'm telling you why.

1017
01:09:09,257 --> 01:09:14,779
[SPEAKER_08]: I almost peed my pants laughing at the chatroom reactions during that song, and that is worth something.

1018
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:15,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1019
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:18,941
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, Rob, you almost peed your pants in Vegas or almost died?

1020
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:21,708
[SPEAKER_08]: and I almost peed my pants on a dead magus.

1021
01:09:21,748 --> 01:09:22,088
[SPEAKER_08]: So what?

1022
01:09:22,108 --> 01:09:22,409
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1023
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:25,331
[SPEAKER_13]: That could be a fetish film.

1024
01:09:26,191 --> 01:09:27,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, here are your choices.

1025
01:09:27,452 --> 01:09:29,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, tonight is a reverse cage match.

1026
01:09:29,753 --> 01:09:35,477
[SPEAKER_08]: The song that wins, quote unquote, if we can call it that, will be banned from Orange Lounge for all eternity.

1027
01:09:36,278 --> 01:09:36,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

1028
01:09:37,718 --> 01:09:38,339

[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1040
01:10:57,130 --> 01:10:57,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow.

1041
01:10:59,091 --> 01:11:00,151
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm loving the reactions.

1042
01:11:00,171 --> 01:11:02,012
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like, no, don't do the recaps.

1043
01:11:02,072 --> 01:11:03,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't play them again, please, for the love of God.

1044
01:11:03,873 --> 01:11:05,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we'll tie those votes momentarily.

1045
01:11:05,994 --> 01:11:09,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Nellie, you had an interesting opinion on Nancy the Boy's Complicated.

1046
01:11:10,075 --> 01:11:10,655
[SPEAKER_14]: I loved it.

1047
01:11:11,236 --> 01:11:12,296
[SPEAKER_09]: It's beautiful.

1048
01:11:12,316 --> 01:11:14,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Why did you love it and think it's beautiful?

1049
01:11:14,917 --> 01:11:15,677
[SPEAKER_09]: It's funny.

1050
01:11:16,297 --> 01:11:17,738
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like the chipmunks.

1051
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:20,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, why do people buy Chipmunks albums?

1052
01:11:20,891 --> 01:11:21,792
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what I want to know.

1053
01:11:22,032 --> 01:11:26,154
[SPEAKER_08]: The Chipmunks, maybe were funny in the 50s, but they're not funny now.

1054
01:11:26,614 --> 01:11:27,734
[SPEAKER_13]: Because they're only two bucks.

1055
01:11:28,175 --> 01:11:28,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1056
01:11:30,075 --> 01:11:31,996
[SPEAKER_13]: It's cheap entertainment, like you, Rob.

1057
01:11:32,517 --> 01:11:36,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Because all you've got to do is slow down the song, and it's the real song.

1058
01:11:37,139 --> 01:11:37,919
[SPEAKER_08]: The real song.

1059
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:40,100
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1060
01:11:41,121 --> 01:11:41,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1061
01:11:42,601 --> 01:11:45,182
[SPEAKER_13]: Nancy and the boys should die of chlamydia, from what I understand.

1062
01:11:45,763 --> 01:11:46,003
[SPEAKER_13]: And they...

1063
01:11:47,308 --> 01:11:49,750
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't, a song can't die of chlamydia.

1064
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:51,691
[SPEAKER_08]: AIDS maybe, but not chlamydia.

1065
01:11:51,711 --> 01:11:54,452
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what, we should send them to Elephant Bar and they can die of hepatitis.

1066
01:11:55,053 --> 01:11:55,233
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1067
01:11:55,773 --> 01:11:58,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, if there's a tie tonight, you guys, we'll kick both songs off.

1068
01:11:58,455 --> 01:11:59,095
[SPEAKER_08]: How's that sound?

1069
01:11:59,996 --> 01:12:00,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay!

1070
01:12:01,217 --> 01:12:02,277
[SPEAKER_08]: There probably will be.

1071
01:12:02,297 --> 01:12:03,178
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking there's going to be.

1072
01:12:03,858 --> 01:12:06,480
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's a tie tonight, guess what other song gets voted off?

1073
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's right, Holic.

1074
01:12:08,741 --> 01:12:09,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Holic in the song.

1075
01:12:10,622 --> 01:12:13,344
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I see some votes coming in for Holic, so you never know.

1076
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:14,945
[SPEAKER_08]: My Holic could win, we'll see.

1077
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:19,442
[SPEAKER_08]: and that Jamie is going to be a pissed off woman if she hears the Holic got banned from the station.

1078
01:12:19,842 --> 01:12:21,163
[SPEAKER_08]: She's going to have my head.

1079
01:12:21,663 --> 01:12:26,226
[SPEAKER_08]: She will never... Not like that, you sick fucks.

1080
01:12:28,987 --> 01:12:32,709
[SPEAKER_08]: She can possibly quit the show if Holic gets banned.

1081
01:12:32,990 --> 01:12:34,190
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Holic's not going to get banned.

1082
01:12:34,210 --> 01:12:35,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on, look at the other crap we played.

1083
01:12:35,731 --> 01:12:36,411
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see what happens, though.

1084
01:12:36,431 --> 01:12:37,072
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see what happens.

1085
01:12:38,272 --> 01:12:38,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1086
01:12:39,933 --> 01:12:40,073
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

1087
01:12:41,474 --> 01:12:43,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go into some other Bomani news.

1088
01:12:43,355 --> 01:12:46,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe the chat room will calm down a bit if we talk about some other things.

1089
01:12:46,775 --> 01:12:47,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody breathe in.

1090
01:12:48,536 --> 01:12:48,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Breathe out.

1091
01:12:50,056 --> 01:12:50,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, alright.

1092
01:12:52,597 --> 01:12:54,077
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm also in Bomani news this week.

1093
01:12:54,097 --> 01:12:55,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't touch there, Rob!

1094
01:12:56,078 --> 01:13:02,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Time Magazine, DDR Freak is reporting, that Time Magazine has named as Game of the Year for 2003, Karaoke Revolution.

1095
01:13:07,026 --> 01:13:07,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

1096
01:13:07,606 --> 01:13:07,947
[SPEAKER_13]: Why?

1097
01:13:08,187 --> 01:13:08,707
[SPEAKER_13]: Dead silence.

1098
01:13:08,767 --> 01:13:09,308
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you guys think?

1099
01:13:09,328 --> 01:13:09,948
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you guys think of this?

1100
01:13:10,068 --> 01:13:12,910
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to hear Loki's thoughts on Karaoke Revolution, having played this.

1101
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:17,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it just came out.

1102
01:13:17,413 --> 01:13:19,434
[SPEAKER_08]: How can they, like, say, oh, it's awesome!

1103
01:13:20,215 --> 01:13:21,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, awesome!

1104
01:13:21,296 --> 01:13:21,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wow!

1105
01:13:23,157 --> 01:13:25,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, totally freaked me out, I forgot it on!

1106
01:13:25,138 --> 01:13:28,661
[SPEAKER_03]: How did they, like, you know, how'd they come up with that?

1107
01:13:28,761 --> 01:13:30,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's just really stupid.

1108
01:13:32,063 --> 01:13:34,945
[SPEAKER_09]: This game rocks, because you can sing the songs!

1109
01:13:38,536 --> 01:13:44,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think it's possibly because it's innovative and people like these innovative games and they think it's going to start a revolution?

1110
01:13:45,461 --> 01:13:46,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that innovative?

1111
01:13:46,602 --> 01:13:49,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, karaoke was just invented by Konami!

1112
01:13:49,764 --> 01:13:50,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Woo!

1113
01:13:53,207 --> 01:13:54,168
[SPEAKER_08]: But what about the eye toy?

1114
01:13:54,188 --> 01:13:57,470
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the eye toy is way more innovative than karaoke revolution.

1115
01:14:00,752 --> 01:14:03,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but you can't sing with poorly recorded cover artists.

1116
01:14:05,273 --> 01:14:08,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, one of those poorly recorded cover artists is one of Angel's friends.

1117
01:14:09,235 --> 01:14:09,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Any point.

1118
01:14:11,376 --> 01:14:13,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Asshole!

1119
01:14:14,097 --> 01:14:14,557
[SPEAKER_10]: God!

1120
01:14:16,438 --> 01:14:16,758
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1121
01:14:17,239 --> 01:14:17,939
[SPEAKER_14]: Not like me.

1122
01:14:21,161 --> 01:14:22,801
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Time Magazine named Karaoke Revolution.

1123
01:14:23,482 --> 01:14:26,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Max 2 never got named Game of the Anything.

1124
01:14:27,363 --> 01:14:29,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Ultramix won't get named Game of the Anything.

1125
01:14:29,945 --> 01:14:32,266
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR is just getting shit on left and right.

1126
01:14:32,346 --> 01:14:33,987
[SPEAKER_08]: It may win MTV's poll.

1127
01:14:34,107 --> 01:14:34,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, goody.

1128
01:14:36,163 --> 01:14:37,524
[SPEAKER_08]: What about Enter the Matrix?

1129
01:14:37,564 --> 01:14:38,825
[SPEAKER_08]: That was an awesome game.

1130
01:14:39,285 --> 01:14:40,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh boy, you forgot about that one.

1131
01:14:41,386 --> 01:14:42,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Guess it was better than the movies, right?

1132
01:14:43,047 --> 01:14:43,548
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just kidding.

1133
01:14:44,308 --> 01:14:46,249
[SPEAKER_08]: It was better than Karaoke Revolution.

1134
01:14:48,210 --> 01:14:50,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Karaoke Revolution is kind of retarded.

1135
01:14:50,492 --> 01:14:54,054
[SPEAKER_08]: All it is is you're basically just taking your home console and singing with it.

1136
01:14:54,894 --> 01:14:55,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Poorly.

1137
01:14:55,655 --> 01:14:56,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Singing poorly with it.

1138
01:14:58,276 --> 01:14:59,157
[SPEAKER_08]: That is just me.

1139
01:14:59,837 --> 01:15:00,778
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of other people.

1140
01:15:01,756 --> 01:15:03,236
[SPEAKER_03]: All you're doing is encouraging them.

1141
01:15:03,316 --> 01:15:03,916
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn it.

1142
01:15:04,216 --> 01:15:07,297
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's anything in this world we need is encouraging stupid people.

1143
01:15:07,657 --> 01:15:09,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do we need to encourage them?

1144
01:15:09,817 --> 01:15:10,277
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn it.

1145
01:15:10,317 --> 01:15:13,978
[SPEAKER_03]: You won't let the stupid Chinese lady just stop asking me for samples.

1146
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:15,838
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you have to go and interject.

1147
01:15:16,338 --> 01:15:19,559
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to go, Oh, yes, I will take a sample.

1148
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:21,639
[SPEAKER_03]: We people want samples.

1149
01:15:21,919 --> 01:15:23,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to ask them now.

1150
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:25,540
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you just won't stop.

1151
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:27,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Same with this goddamn thing.

1152
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:29,881
[SPEAKER_03]: People sometimes weren't meant to sing.

1153
01:15:30,201 --> 01:15:30,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a fact.

1154
01:15:32,357 --> 01:15:32,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't sing.

1155
01:15:33,017 --> 01:15:36,820
[SPEAKER_03]: And this gives them a false hope that someday they'll become a singing superstar.

1156
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:40,683
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the meantime, they have to torture us with their horrible renditions of crap.

1157
01:15:41,944 --> 01:15:43,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Including complicated.

1158
01:15:44,405 --> 01:15:44,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Lame.

1159
01:15:45,706 --> 01:15:45,906
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1160
01:15:46,827 --> 01:15:47,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Game of the year?

1161
01:15:47,988 --> 01:15:48,728
[SPEAKER_03]: I think not.

1162
01:15:51,410 --> 01:15:53,712
[SPEAKER_08]: But you seemed to have a good time when you played this game.

1163
01:15:56,034 --> 01:15:58,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, great time was had by me.

1164
01:15:58,255 --> 01:15:58,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Not...

1165
01:16:07,022 --> 01:16:07,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1166
01:16:08,603 --> 01:16:09,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Pixie Dust.

1167
01:16:10,225 --> 01:16:15,371
[SPEAKER_13]: This game encourages my Filipino relatives to go and buy an Xbox and play Karaoke Revolution.

1168
01:16:15,511 --> 01:16:16,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, it's on the PS2, dear.

1169
01:16:16,512 --> 01:16:17,053
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, PS2.

1170
01:16:17,113 --> 01:16:18,014
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought it was on Xbox.

1171
01:16:18,234 --> 01:16:19,495
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Xbox is Ultramix.

1172
01:16:19,695 --> 01:16:20,096
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.

1173
01:16:20,991 --> 01:16:24,253
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet you anything Xbox will get a karaoke revolution if it sells well on PS2.

1174
01:16:24,273 --> 01:16:25,054
[SPEAKER_08]: I bet you anything.

1175
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:29,097
[SPEAKER_13]: It encourages my aunts to go, oh, that's karaoke.

1176
01:16:29,357 --> 01:16:29,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, shit.

1177
01:16:30,078 --> 01:16:35,541
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, we'll go get that and we'll get some wine and beer and smoke a lot and fight cocks all day long.

1178
01:16:37,203 --> 01:16:37,443
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1179
01:16:38,744 --> 01:16:39,464
[SPEAKER_13]: Filipino relatives.

1180
01:16:41,986 --> 01:16:43,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Fight cocks.

1181
01:16:43,527 --> 01:16:44,268
[SPEAKER_13]: Fight them.

1182
01:16:44,328 --> 01:16:45,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, fight cocks.

1183
01:16:45,128 --> 01:16:45,889
[SPEAKER_13]: Cock fighting.

1184
01:16:45,969 --> 01:16:50,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, why don't we just come out with like Blowjob Revolution or something like that, you know?

1185
01:16:51,693 --> 01:16:55,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't we have a list list like that one week where we were deciding what needs a Bomani game?

1186
01:16:55,614 --> 01:16:56,575
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to say something.

1187
01:16:56,855 --> 01:16:59,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I want to say Beat Your Meat Mania won that, actually.

1188
01:16:59,596 --> 01:17:00,196
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it did.

1189
01:17:02,597 --> 01:17:02,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

1190
01:17:04,138 --> 01:17:07,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows what revolution Konami will try to start next.

1191
01:17:07,599 --> 01:17:09,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, we're going to take another break here.

1192
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,021
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we come back, we'll announce the winner of the cage match.

1193
01:17:12,061 --> 01:17:13,421
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to take a break to tally the votes.

1194
01:17:13,461 --> 01:17:16,722
[SPEAKER_08]: We have more votes tonight in tonight's cage match than I've ever seen in a cage match ever.

1195
01:17:17,043 --> 01:17:20,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Which makes me think we need to do a reverse cage match every week.

1196
01:17:22,222 --> 01:17:23,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kidding, just kidding.

1197
01:17:23,322 --> 01:17:23,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't kill me.

1198
01:17:24,123 --> 01:17:24,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't kill me.

1199
01:17:24,623 --> 01:17:26,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we'll end up having no songs on the station.

1200
01:17:27,724 --> 01:17:28,905
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just keep voting for Holic.

1201
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:35,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, are we going to get into this add-on crap later?

1202
01:17:36,047 --> 01:17:36,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

1203
01:17:36,588 --> 01:17:40,389
[SPEAKER_08]: When we come back, we're going to talk a little more about Ultramix since it is coming out this week after all.

1204
01:17:41,049 --> 01:17:43,030
[SPEAKER_08]: In this break, just a random potpourri of stuff.

1205
01:17:43,050 --> 01:17:46,911
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple songs from Guitar Freaks and something from DDR that I rather like.

1206
01:17:46,951 --> 01:17:48,312
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know some of you listening like it too.

1207
01:17:48,812 --> 01:17:50,593
[SPEAKER_08]: So enjoy these good songs.

1208
01:17:52,068 --> 01:17:53,790
[SPEAKER_08]: After that little orgy of bad stuff.

1209
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:54,471
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll be right back.

1210
01:17:54,491 --> 01:17:55,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, it's all relative.

1211
01:17:55,512 --> 01:17:56,694
[SPEAKER_08]: You can hate all three of these songs.

1212
01:17:56,774 --> 01:17:58,476
[SPEAKER_08]: But, well, sucks to be you.

1213
01:17:59,077 --> 01:17:59,498
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back.

1214
01:19:15,027 --> 01:19:16,029
It's great man!

1215
01:19:42,219 --> 01:19:43,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

1216
01:20:25,782 --> 01:20:27,082
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network

1217
01:20:54,926 --> 01:20:55,743
Thanks for watching!

1218
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:25,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1219
01:22:26,101 --> 01:22:28,262
[SPEAKER_08]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

1220
01:22:35,426 --> 01:22:36,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we're back.

1221
01:22:37,307 --> 01:22:38,648
[SPEAKER_08]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1222
01:22:38,908 --> 01:22:43,091
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have the winner, or should I say loser, of tonight's reverse cage match.

1223
01:22:43,151 --> 01:22:43,731
[SPEAKER_08]: You are loser!

1224
01:22:44,051 --> 01:22:49,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Just out of curiosity, what would you have voted for, gang, and what do you think is going to lose?

1225
01:22:49,394 --> 01:22:50,995
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you, tonight's loser...

1226
01:22:52,651 --> 01:22:54,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Got 79% of the votes.

1227
01:22:55,993 --> 01:22:56,574
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think?

1228
01:22:56,754 --> 01:22:57,675
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think should lose?

1229
01:22:57,695 --> 01:22:58,515
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think will lose?

1230
01:22:58,575 --> 01:22:59,056
[SPEAKER_08]: No silent.

1231
01:23:00,056 --> 01:23:01,557
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, the second song.

1232
01:23:02,038 --> 01:23:02,458
[SPEAKER_19]: Holic?

1233
01:23:03,419 --> 01:23:04,680
[SPEAKER_19]: You think Holic should lose?

1234
01:23:04,700 --> 01:23:06,841
[SPEAKER_08]: You think Holic should lose or will lose?

1235
01:23:06,861 --> 01:23:07,662
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, will lose.

1236
01:23:07,862 --> 01:23:08,782
[SPEAKER_15]: You think Holic will lose?

1237
01:23:09,163 --> 01:23:09,423
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1238
01:23:09,743 --> 01:23:11,324
[SPEAKER_15]: And, uh, the one will stay?

1239
01:23:11,344 --> 01:23:12,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's it.

1240
01:23:12,805 --> 01:23:14,827
[SPEAKER_08]: What would you want to kick out of the four of those?

1241
01:23:14,847 --> 01:23:14,907
[SPEAKER_15]: Um...

1242
01:23:17,099 --> 01:23:18,640
[SPEAKER_15]: The slow one, the Titanic song.

1243
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:19,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, my heart will go on.

1244
01:23:19,921 --> 01:23:20,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that one.

1245
01:23:20,922 --> 01:23:23,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Pixie Dust, what do you think will be booted and what would you do?

1246
01:23:23,644 --> 01:23:27,707
[SPEAKER_13]: You have just got on Jamie's bad side for saying how it will be banned.

1247
01:23:28,127 --> 01:23:30,389
[SPEAKER_13]: You fucker.

1248
01:23:31,510 --> 01:23:33,431
[SPEAKER_13]: Avril, or Nancy and the Boys.

1249
01:23:33,831 --> 01:23:34,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Will be banned?

1250
01:23:34,952 --> 01:23:35,573
[SPEAKER_13]: Will be banned.

1251
01:23:35,773 --> 01:23:36,633
[SPEAKER_08]: And what should be banned?

1252
01:23:37,274 --> 01:23:38,014
[SPEAKER_13]: What should be banned?

1253
01:23:38,054 --> 01:23:38,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1254
01:23:38,515 --> 01:23:39,756
[SPEAKER_13]: Fucking Titanic song.

1255
01:23:39,776 --> 01:23:40,176
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1256
01:23:43,157 --> 01:23:45,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Angel, what song do you think got 79% of the vote tonight?

1257
01:23:46,799 --> 01:23:48,981
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably the Avril Lavigne cover.

1258
01:23:49,221 --> 01:23:51,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and what do you think should be?

1259
01:23:51,542 --> 01:23:52,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think it's rightfully so?

1260
01:23:53,924 --> 01:23:56,926
[SPEAKER_14]: Either that or the Stupid Titanic song, sorry.

1261
01:23:57,126 --> 01:23:58,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1262
01:23:58,487 --> 01:24:00,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Magus, what will be booted off tonight?

1263
01:24:00,628 --> 01:24:03,810
[SPEAKER_08]: What should... Sadly, I think Holic will go...

1264
01:24:04,614 --> 01:24:06,155
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, you think Holic's going to go tonight?

1265
01:24:06,235 --> 01:24:07,475
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think should go?

1266
01:24:07,855 --> 01:24:08,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely complicated.

1267
01:24:09,136 --> 01:24:12,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Should have gone, but I have a feeling it's going to be Holic.

1268
01:24:12,557 --> 01:24:13,298
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we'll see.

1269
01:24:13,558 --> 01:24:13,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Magus?

1270
01:24:13,978 --> 01:24:14,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Momentarily.

1271
01:24:14,718 --> 01:24:15,679
[SPEAKER_06]: I will kill you later.

1272
01:24:15,699 --> 01:24:16,319
[SPEAKER_08]: What should go?

1273
01:24:16,339 --> 01:24:17,399
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think will go?

1274
01:24:17,479 --> 01:24:20,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Not expressing opinion, just Holic should go because it sucks.

1275
01:24:20,841 --> 01:24:23,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, we should remove all tech music from this station.

1276
01:24:25,143 --> 01:24:26,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie will stab you for that.

1277
01:24:26,683 --> 01:24:30,505
[SPEAKER_08]: If Jamie's listening, she's going to come back and shove one of those ferrets right up your ass.

1278
01:24:34,224 --> 01:24:34,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

1279
01:24:35,205 --> 01:24:38,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, but in all seriousness, what do you think will be voted tonight?

1280
01:24:40,127 --> 01:24:40,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Holic?

1281
01:24:42,889 --> 01:24:45,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well I already know who's losing.

1282
01:24:46,611 --> 01:24:53,735
[SPEAKER_08]: And with 79% of the vote, the song You... I'm sorry, what's going on over there?

1283
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:55,696
[SPEAKER_13]: They're raping the ferrets!

1284
01:24:57,717 --> 01:24:58,357
[SPEAKER_13]: Bastards!

1285
01:24:58,717 --> 01:24:59,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-huh.

1286
01:24:59,377 --> 01:25:00,478
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't play with the ferrets.

1287
01:25:00,578 --> 01:25:01,578
[SPEAKER_13]: Jamie would be upset.

1288
01:25:02,558 --> 01:25:03,778
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

1289
01:25:03,798 --> 01:25:04,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't play with the ferrets.

1290
01:25:04,599 --> 01:25:06,339
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to get beat up when Jamie comes back.

1291
01:25:06,459 --> 01:25:11,080
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm the one who's going to be here because two of these bastards live in frickin' the Bay Area.

1292
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:12,800
[SPEAKER_13]: Bastards.

1293
01:25:14,441 --> 01:25:14,881
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

1294
01:25:15,461 --> 01:25:15,821
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

1295
01:25:17,561 --> 01:25:18,242
[SPEAKER_13]: Repeat that.

1296
01:25:18,442 --> 01:25:19,682
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, so the ferrets are stiff.

1297
01:25:19,822 --> 01:25:20,402
[SPEAKER_19]: That's all I said.

1298
01:25:21,102 --> 01:25:22,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Ferrets are all stiff.

1299
01:25:27,185 --> 01:25:28,527
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, Rob, I'll quiet them down.

1300
01:25:28,767 --> 01:25:34,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, yeah, would you get those... Would you get that... Get them all shutting up, please.

1301
01:25:37,037 --> 01:25:37,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, here we go.

1302
01:25:38,179 --> 01:25:43,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight's loser with 79% of the votes is... Complicated.

1303
01:25:52,737 --> 01:25:56,599
[SPEAKER_24]: It is gone from this station forever.

1304
01:25:56,619 --> 01:25:57,839
[SPEAKER_24]: Bye-bye.

1305
01:25:57,859 --> 01:26:02,041
[SPEAKER_08]: That was my little car screeching noise.

1306
01:26:02,581 --> 01:26:02,901
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1307
01:26:04,482 --> 01:26:09,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so Complicated does get the boot from the station, and you will never hear it on this station ever again.

1308
01:26:09,704 --> 01:26:17,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if somebody is trying to play Speed 10 in their entirety, they must skip track one, because you guys have voted Complicated off of the station.

1309
01:26:18,428 --> 01:26:19,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I can strip now.

1310
01:26:20,698 --> 01:26:23,660
[SPEAKER_08]: So in celebration, Pixie Dust will be getting naked for you all right now.

1311
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:25,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, except the cam's down tonight.

1312
01:26:25,961 --> 01:26:26,441
[SPEAKER_08]: What a bummer.

1313
01:26:27,142 --> 01:26:28,022
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, Rob, where's the music?

1314
01:26:28,723 --> 01:26:29,163
[SPEAKER_08]: What music?

1315
01:26:30,624 --> 01:26:37,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I only have... My only stripping song was Complicated, so now I... Rob, you got your show yesterday at RecCon.

1316
01:26:37,828 --> 01:26:38,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, what?

1317
01:26:38,788 --> 01:26:40,269
[SPEAKER_13]: You got your show yesterday at RecCon.

1318
01:26:42,469 --> 01:26:43,350
[SPEAKER_13]: You got my... Oh, yeah, I did.

1319
01:26:43,370 --> 01:26:43,930
[SPEAKER_08]: I did get it to show you.

1320
01:26:43,950 --> 01:26:44,470
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll show you right now.

1321
01:26:45,070 --> 01:26:49,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Arcadian is saying I should delete the file off my computer completely, and I think that is a good idea.

1322
01:26:50,072 --> 01:26:51,933
[SPEAKER_08]: So, here we go.

1323
01:26:52,173 --> 01:26:53,794
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to... I'm currently going in.

1324
01:26:53,834 --> 01:26:56,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's my Dance Mania Speed 10 directory.

1325
01:26:57,075 --> 01:26:59,576
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to Complicated, and I'm deleting it.

1326
01:27:00,176 --> 01:27:01,957
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, do you want to send it to the recycle bin?

1327
01:27:01,997 --> 01:27:02,737
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just click yes.

1328
01:27:03,638 --> 01:27:07,019
[SPEAKER_08]: And now I'm minimizing my... So I can get to the recycle bin, and here we go.

1329
01:27:07,079 --> 01:27:07,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait for it.

1330
01:27:07,639 --> 01:27:08,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait for it.

1331
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:09,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, wait for it.

1332
01:27:10,703 --> 01:27:12,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Erwin, did you hear that little sound?

1333
01:27:12,304 --> 01:27:14,165
[SPEAKER_08]: That little paper-wrecking sound?

1334
01:27:14,185 --> 01:27:14,625
[SPEAKER_08]: That was it.

1335
01:27:14,705 --> 01:27:17,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Complicated is off my hard drive and gone forever.

1336
01:27:22,289 --> 01:27:22,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Gone forever.

1337
01:27:23,770 --> 01:27:24,030
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1338
01:27:26,411 --> 01:27:31,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you had some stuff you wanted to share tonight with DDR Ultramix, since, believe it or not, we are a Bimani-related show.

1339
01:27:33,592 --> 01:27:35,933
[SPEAKER_08]: They've already announced what the first song pack is going to be.

1340
01:27:36,674 --> 01:27:53,762
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a bunch of Konami originals, starting with DJ Taka with Abyss from 5th Mix, Naoki Burning the Floor from 4th Mix, Tomasuki with Mind Parasite from Dance Maniacs, Mr. T with some guy...

1341
01:27:55,814 --> 01:28:05,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Motolake F, Burning Heat 3 Option Mix from Max 2, and Rick, in my eyes, from, I believe that was 5th Mix, 4th Style.

1342
01:28:08,961 --> 01:28:10,242
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's it, $5 for 5 songs.

1343
01:28:10,642 --> 01:28:10,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.

1344
01:28:13,529 --> 01:28:15,210
[SPEAKER_08]: The one on there you guys probably don't know.

1345
01:28:15,230 --> 01:28:16,531
[SPEAKER_08]: I think everybody knows Abyss.

1346
01:28:16,571 --> 01:28:17,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody knows Burning the Floor.

1347
01:28:18,473 --> 01:28:22,335
[SPEAKER_08]: The few you guys might not know, or you may have forgotten what they sound like.

1348
01:28:22,395 --> 01:28:24,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear a little bit here of Mind Parasite.

1349
01:28:24,617 --> 01:28:25,337
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I have this.

1350
01:28:27,218 --> 01:28:28,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Or at least I thought I did.

1351
01:28:28,139 --> 01:28:28,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I don't.

1352
01:28:28,979 --> 01:28:31,301
[SPEAKER_08]: It could have been on Loki's old drive, actually.

1353
01:28:32,462 --> 01:28:33,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, shit.

1354
01:28:34,203 --> 01:28:35,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, don't I look like a dumbass?

1355
01:28:36,805 --> 01:28:37,745
[SPEAKER_13]: What's different from any other day?

1356
01:28:37,765 --> 01:28:38,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know.

1357
01:28:38,286 --> 01:28:39,246
[SPEAKER_08]: What's different from any other day?

1358
01:28:39,286 --> 01:28:40,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1359
01:28:40,367 --> 01:28:41,328
[SPEAKER_13]: I love you all.

1360
01:28:41,348 --> 01:28:41,428
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye.

1361
01:28:43,098 --> 01:28:50,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh wait, no, I do, here we go, this is Mind Parasite, and this is good because this is Tomosuke, who is half of Orange Lounge actually, so this is Mind Parasite.

1362
01:29:19,304 --> 01:29:21,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that is a little bit of Mind Parasite.

1363
01:29:21,585 --> 01:29:23,186
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to be a song that you can download.

1364
01:29:23,266 --> 01:29:25,727
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be, what, five bucks for this?

1365
01:29:26,267 --> 01:29:27,928
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like paying for games on my cell phone.

1366
01:29:27,948 --> 01:29:29,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it five bucks a month?

1367
01:29:29,608 --> 01:29:32,630
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's just five bucks and you permanently get all those songs forever.

1368
01:29:33,690 --> 01:29:39,893
[SPEAKER_08]: The other song I was going to play is In My Eyes, except I deleted my Force Style soundtrack to make room for Final Fantasy XI.

1369
01:29:40,253 --> 01:29:40,693
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've got to...

1370
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:42,621
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got to consult.

1371
01:29:42,681 --> 01:29:43,261
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you're right.

1372
01:29:43,321 --> 01:29:44,142
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

1373
01:29:44,262 --> 01:29:45,323
[SPEAKER_08]: I am a stupid idiot.

1374
01:29:45,383 --> 01:29:46,244
[SPEAKER_08]: It is on 5th style.

1375
01:29:46,784 --> 01:29:47,885
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm picturing it right now.

1376
01:29:48,105 --> 01:29:49,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Why was I thinking 4th style?

1377
01:29:49,426 --> 01:29:49,806
[SPEAKER_08]: You know why?

1378
01:29:49,846 --> 01:29:52,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I get Love Will mixed up with it.

1379
01:29:53,269 --> 01:29:53,649
[SPEAKER_08]: I should.

1380
01:29:53,669 --> 01:29:55,511
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to grab your 5th style soundtrack, go get it.

1381
01:29:57,867 --> 01:29:59,388
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll hear you in my eyes in the next break.

1382
01:29:59,428 --> 01:29:59,808
[SPEAKER_08]: How's that?

1383
01:29:59,908 --> 01:30:01,389
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll just save that for the next break.

1384
01:30:03,671 --> 01:30:16,079
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you guys think of this whole... We've kind of brought this up on the show before, but now that it's coming to light and the details are coming out and the song list is coming out, what do you guys think of this whole paying $5 to download songs bit?

1385
01:30:16,099 --> 01:30:16,640
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think of this?

1386
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:17,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it a good idea, a bad idea?

1387
01:30:18,221 --> 01:30:20,342
[SPEAKER_13]: I could pay $5 to have sex with Rob.

1388
01:30:21,243 --> 01:30:21,763
[SPEAKER_13]: Bad idea.

1389
01:30:23,544 --> 01:30:23,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh!

1390
01:30:23,965 --> 01:30:24,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh!

1391
01:30:28,150 --> 01:30:28,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Haha, you're not funny.

1392
01:30:31,071 --> 01:30:33,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Seki, seki, five dollars, we love you long time.

1393
01:30:35,111 --> 01:30:35,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1394
01:30:35,672 --> 01:30:37,272
[SPEAKER_13]: I paid five dollars to get away.

1395
01:30:38,472 --> 01:30:40,753
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think, what do you think of this idea?

1396
01:30:40,773 --> 01:30:42,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Does somebody have a serious comment here, Angel?

1397
01:30:44,813 --> 01:30:46,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, no.

1398
01:30:47,054 --> 01:30:49,734
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we already pay enough for Mamani.

1399
01:30:49,754 --> 01:30:56,836
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're like Mamani, you know, addicts like we all are, you know, we already pay enough for like, you know, getting 2DX in our houses and

1400
01:30:57,475 --> 01:31:02,177
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, being able to play that because you have to buy another system for that and all that crap.

1401
01:31:02,397 --> 01:31:02,657
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

1402
01:31:06,139 --> 01:31:09,141
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, yeah, so, you know, I mean, we already pay enough.

1403
01:31:09,761 --> 01:31:15,504
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think we should be paying any more because there's something called... Well, Loki knows what I'm talking about.

1404
01:31:22,147 --> 01:31:22,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1405
01:31:23,766 --> 01:31:29,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Why even bother with UltraVix at all when you can just install Linux on an Xbox and run StepMania?

1406
01:31:30,974 --> 01:31:32,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's assume not everyone knows how to do that.

1407
01:31:32,876 --> 01:31:35,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Not everyone's a nerdy genius like you, I guess.

1408
01:31:37,981 --> 01:31:39,903
[SPEAKER_08]: I use that term extremely loosely.

1409
01:31:40,083 --> 01:31:40,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of like you.

1410
01:31:41,424 --> 01:31:41,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kidding.

1411
01:31:41,845 --> 01:31:41,945
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1412
01:31:44,409 --> 01:31:45,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's the loose one?

1413
01:31:45,350 --> 01:31:46,130
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just kidding.

1414
01:31:46,210 --> 01:31:46,670
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kidding.

1415
01:31:47,111 --> 01:31:48,031
[SPEAKER_08]: I love you, Janae.

1416
01:31:48,551 --> 01:31:50,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Pixie Dust, don't get pouty with me.

1417
01:31:50,573 --> 01:31:52,634
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to come show you some love, Pixie Dust.

1418
01:31:52,654 --> 01:31:53,574
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to show you some love.

1419
01:31:54,015 --> 01:31:54,835
[SPEAKER_08]: I love you.

1420
01:31:54,875 --> 01:31:56,116
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to put my head on your bosom.

1421
01:31:57,897 --> 01:31:59,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody get the camera.

1422
01:31:59,238 --> 01:32:00,919
[SPEAKER_08]: I love you, Pixie Dust.

1423
01:32:01,159 --> 01:32:02,039
I love you, too.

1424
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:03,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1425
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:04,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Bear it, love.

1426
01:32:04,421 --> 01:32:05,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Bear it, love.

1427
01:32:10,885 --> 01:32:12,786
[SPEAKER_08]: I can put an Xbox on those tits, man.

1428
01:32:15,068 --> 01:32:19,011
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's good shopping.

1429
01:32:19,031 --> 01:32:19,991
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I love you.

1430
01:32:20,011 --> 01:32:20,612
[SPEAKER_14]: I love you too.

1431
01:32:20,752 --> 01:32:22,092
[SPEAKER_14]: Bastard.

1432
01:32:25,534 --> 01:32:29,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, I know you of all people love to pay to download things.

1433
01:32:29,277 --> 01:32:31,918
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to hear your thoughts on the $5 for 5 songs bit.

1434
01:32:33,819 --> 01:32:34,159
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just $5.

1435
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:42,824
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd just do it so... Well, if I had the Xbox version or whatever, I might download it just so I can rip them.

1436
01:32:43,325 --> 01:32:43,485
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

1437
01:32:44,915 --> 01:32:47,396
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see a problem with paying $5 for five songs.

1438
01:32:47,416 --> 01:32:50,717
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not that, you know, expensive for just a one-time purchase.

1439
01:32:50,777 --> 01:32:51,978
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like an add-on CD.

1440
01:32:52,978 --> 01:32:56,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, of all people, I was not expecting you to support this.

1441
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:03,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I would do it, but, I mean, not to say that it's not going to be a workaround, because I'm pretty sure that there is.

1442
01:33:03,442 --> 01:33:04,982
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, whatever.

1443
01:33:07,443 --> 01:33:10,164
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just download them off of, like, Supernova, because I'm sure they'll have it.

1444
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:18,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think people would pay for these when they can go off of Stepmania's many dedicated sites and get it for free?

1445
01:33:19,666 --> 01:33:22,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, those are going to be the same people that are going to buy the game or not.

1446
01:33:24,309 --> 01:33:29,453
[SPEAKER_08]: I probably will because we normally buy the game, but then I rip the songs and I play them on mine.

1447
01:33:30,703 --> 01:33:39,305
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I actually think I'd buy the expansion pack, too, but the problem is I don't own an Xbox, and I still have higher things on my priority list to get, even with DDR coming out.

1448
01:33:39,345 --> 01:33:43,046
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, ooh, I need a new processor for my computer so I can play Final Fantasy XI.

1449
01:33:43,066 --> 01:33:45,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, I need a bigger hard drive for my MP3s.

1450
01:33:45,627 --> 01:33:46,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, I need to buy a hooker.

1451
01:33:47,687 --> 01:33:49,528
[SPEAKER_13]: You bought me last night, Rob!

1452
01:33:49,588 --> 01:33:50,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1453
01:33:50,308 --> 01:33:53,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, but you from the 99-cent hooker store.

1454
01:33:54,389 --> 01:33:55,289
[SPEAKER_08]: I can afford that.

1455
01:33:56,639 --> 01:33:58,000
[SPEAKER_08]: It's dark, she knew it.

1456
01:33:58,140 --> 01:33:59,320
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1457
01:33:59,581 --> 01:34:03,182
[SPEAKER_08]: She had to raise her prices due to inflation in the breasts.

1458
01:34:05,484 --> 01:34:07,385
[SPEAKER_14]: Not like that mom and that baby, huh, Rob?

1459
01:34:08,745 --> 01:34:09,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1460
01:34:09,826 --> 01:34:11,527
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, come on, you're not going to tell them about that?

1461
01:34:12,587 --> 01:34:13,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you tell it?

1462
01:34:13,268 --> 01:34:14,068
[SPEAKER_08]: You tell it so much better.

1463
01:34:14,869 --> 01:34:17,970
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I won't, because now Loki's saying no, so never mind.

1464
01:34:18,030 --> 01:34:19,351
[SPEAKER_08]: No, don't listen to Loki, I never do.

1465
01:34:20,808 --> 01:34:31,873
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we were coming out of the grocery store, going back to the car, and this mom comes out with the kid in the cart, and all of a sudden Loki responds with, Oh, look!

1466
01:34:32,603 --> 01:34:37,105
[SPEAKER_14]: They sold a kid or something, and the kid was all happy and whatever, and we all busted up laughing.

1467
01:34:37,725 --> 01:34:39,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Loki wants to correct some things.

1468
01:34:39,626 --> 01:34:53,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, correct it, because I don't... I saw this stupid woman who looked homely with her stupid baby in the car, you know, pushing her around, picking up cans or whatever, and then I'm like, aw, how cute, she's gonna go sell her baby.

1469
01:34:53,411 --> 01:34:56,492
[SPEAKER_03]: And the baby was all happy to be rid of her crack-horn mom.

1470
01:34:57,192 --> 01:35:01,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1471
01:35:03,314 --> 01:35:06,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, um, wow.

1472
01:35:07,416 --> 01:35:09,056
[SPEAKER_08]: What else is going on in the Bomani world?

1473
01:35:09,596 --> 01:35:11,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, what's going on in the sim scene?

1474
01:35:11,357 --> 01:35:12,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything new in the sim world?

1475
01:35:12,678 --> 01:35:14,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you give us our sim update of the week.

1476
01:35:16,199 --> 01:35:19,780
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR Maniacs, this site came up, yippee.

1477
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:30,904
[SPEAKER_08]: And on DDRAmerica.com or whatever, your BitTorrent site, you can find the wonderful Dancing Stage Fever songs, which I played today, and they suck.

1478
01:35:31,613 --> 01:35:32,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Surprise, surprise.

1479
01:35:33,795 --> 01:35:35,116
[SPEAKER_08]: The end.

1480
01:35:37,798 --> 01:35:38,138
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

1481
01:35:38,239 --> 01:35:38,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing else going on.

1482
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:40,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing.

1483
01:35:41,461 --> 01:35:41,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Zilch.

1484
01:35:44,344 --> 01:35:44,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1485
01:35:45,685 --> 01:35:49,748
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to take a quick break and when we come back we're going to do the FUs of the week.

1486
01:35:50,469 --> 01:35:50,769
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

1487
01:35:51,953 --> 01:35:57,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Send those on over to private message to Sky in the chat room and we'll be reading those right after this quick break.

1488
01:35:57,575 --> 01:35:59,975
[SPEAKER_08]: And all three of these songs have something in common.

1489
01:36:00,015 --> 01:36:04,856
[SPEAKER_08]: They may have a different artist's name, but they still have something very much in common.

1490
01:36:04,936 --> 01:36:05,397
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back.

1491
01:36:06,737 --> 01:36:07,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Starting off with In My Eyes.

1492
01:36:07,977 --> 01:36:09,538
[SPEAKER_11]: In My Eyes

1493
01:38:13,544 --> 01:38:18,066
[SPEAKER_12]: The end is near, the end is near, the end is near, the end is near, the end is near

1494
01:38:54,316 --> 01:38:55,737
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get it!

1495
01:38:55,757 --> 01:38:56,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get it!

1496
01:38:56,498 --> 01:38:57,399
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get it!

1497
01:39:06,778 --> 01:39:07,739
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for watching!

1498
01:39:51,694 --> 01:39:52,702
Thank you for watching!

1499
01:41:52,226 --> 01:41:58,088
[SPEAKER_20]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

1500
01:41:59,068 --> 01:42:00,389
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, we're back.

1501
01:42:04,654 --> 01:42:08,237
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's about time to get into our favorite part of the show, the FUs of the week.

1502
01:42:08,257 --> 01:42:10,758
[SPEAKER_08]: But first, we want to make a few quick programming announcements.

1503
01:42:11,699 --> 01:42:21,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Vanilla Sky will not be on tomorrow night because I have to do some other errands and with work getting busy and all, I can't stay up late, so I have to take Angel home tomorrow.

1504
01:42:22,346 --> 01:42:23,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Loki.

1505
01:42:24,488 --> 01:42:28,130
[SPEAKER_08]: And unfortunately, with my computer being the way it is and the situation I'm in, I'm

1506
01:42:30,290 --> 01:42:34,491
[SPEAKER_08]: and unfortunately unable to do a LiveWire show this week.

1507
01:42:34,532 --> 01:42:42,574
[SPEAKER_08]: And that kind of sucks too, but I didn't plan for it to be this way and try and make sure it's not, but the computer's kind of up in the air right now.

1508
01:42:43,815 --> 01:42:46,896
[SPEAKER_08]: So instead, Vanilla Sky will be on Wednesday this week.

1509
01:42:47,016 --> 01:42:50,077
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to move over to Wednesday this week since there won't be a new LiveWire this week.

1510
01:42:50,497 --> 01:42:58,320
[SPEAKER_08]: And tomorrow night, if we can get the computer hooked up tomorrow, I don't know, I'll play an old episode of LiveWire in an increased bitrate.

1511
01:42:58,869 --> 01:43:01,770
[SPEAKER_08]: So it'll be like a higher quality stream.

1512
01:43:01,830 --> 01:43:04,811
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll do that tomorrow for Monday night.

1513
01:43:05,671 --> 01:43:11,353
[SPEAKER_08]: If we can't get that to happen, we'll rerun an old episode of Vanilla Sky and a new episode of Vanilla Sky on Wednesday this week.

1514
01:43:11,673 --> 01:43:13,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Pump up the volume, of course, on Tuesday.

1515
01:43:13,513 --> 01:43:14,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Rerun this week.

1516
01:43:14,434 --> 01:43:15,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie is still in Alabama.

1517
01:43:15,694 --> 01:43:22,296
[SPEAKER_08]: She does get back on Tuesday, but we don't expect her to want to walk through the door and sign online first thing.

1518
01:43:23,056 --> 01:43:25,439
[SPEAKER_08]: She's probably going to want to sleep for a little while.

1519
01:43:25,460 --> 01:43:26,541
[SPEAKER_08]: So she'll be back next week though.

1520
01:43:26,581 --> 01:43:27,883
[SPEAKER_08]: She'll be back Sunday for sure.

1521
01:43:28,303 --> 01:43:31,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Season 4 of Orange Lounge Radio debuts this Sunday.

1522
01:43:31,387 --> 01:43:37,255
[SPEAKER_08]: And the catch was that we were going to go MP3 Pro on Sunday, but we'll get into that in the FU's of the week.

1523
01:43:39,117 --> 01:43:40,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Which it is now time for you guys.

1524
01:43:43,171 --> 01:43:45,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go, we are going into the FUs of the week.

1525
01:43:46,153 --> 01:43:50,215
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to get a little bit old school this week with the FU music because of Loki's computer being down.

1526
01:43:50,255 --> 01:43:52,977
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm missing a few files, but we'll start it off.

1527
01:44:03,544 --> 01:44:03,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1528
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:08,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie this week would like to give a big F.U.

1529
01:44:08,241 --> 01:44:13,702
[SPEAKER_08]: to stupid people and us.

1530
01:44:14,002 --> 01:44:14,382
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1531
01:44:14,462 --> 01:44:14,802
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1532
01:44:14,942 --> 01:44:19,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Stupid drivers and things that are pissing her off in Alabama.

1533
01:44:20,283 --> 01:44:23,264
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure she misses all of us greatly.

1534
01:44:24,144 --> 01:44:25,164
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's Jamie's F.U.

1535
01:44:25,184 --> 01:44:28,505
[SPEAKER_08]: for tonight, which I am entering on her behalf.

1536
01:44:29,646 --> 01:44:31,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Up next is Loki with his F.U.s.

1537
01:44:32,956 --> 01:44:35,537
[SPEAKER_08]: And he still has the Christmas speed music, I promise, two weeks ago.

1538
01:44:38,658 --> 01:44:41,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Wish you would have thought of this when we did the cage match, huh?

1539
01:44:45,220 --> 01:44:56,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, uh, F you, or, uh, fuck you to, um, Price, because you suck, because the fact that I had to drive down there to get you to suck.

1540
01:44:56,644 --> 01:45:02,287
[SPEAKER_08]: I spent my money there, I come back here, I'm working on my computer, I look at my processor, oh, guess what, they gave me the wrong processor.

1541
01:45:02,647 --> 01:45:11,892
[SPEAKER_03]: So I drive another half hour all the way back to Fry's, wait an hour, wait in line for another hour, get a new processor, and drive back.

1542
01:45:12,092 --> 01:45:15,453
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally I tried it in my computer, and my computer worked.

1543
01:45:15,473 --> 01:45:21,116
[SPEAKER_03]: My old computer, something happened to the motherboard, you know, when I was installing it, so that didn't work.

1544
01:45:21,136 --> 01:45:24,738
[SPEAKER_03]: So I go back to Fry's, and go pick up a new motherboard, and come back home,

1545
01:45:25,411 --> 01:45:27,192
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasted four hours because of Fry.

1546
01:45:28,452 --> 01:45:29,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Surprise stuff.

1547
01:45:29,652 --> 01:45:39,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there was this guy today when I was driving on the road who was trying to scratch his ass or something while driving his beat up truck and was like swerving all over the road.

1548
01:45:39,635 --> 01:45:43,416
[SPEAKER_08]: Like practically just driving in two lanes at once and stuff like that.

1549
01:45:44,036 --> 01:45:46,316
[SPEAKER_08]: So I hate people and they deserve to die.

1550
01:45:46,857 --> 01:45:48,337
[SPEAKER_08]: And another thing was...

1551
01:45:49,417 --> 01:45:53,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck you, people with cell phones, because your cell phones are going to get taken away pretty soon.

1552
01:45:53,161 --> 01:45:56,004
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not going to be able to drive in your car with cell phones.

1553
01:45:56,564 --> 01:45:57,245
[SPEAKER_08]: So, guess what?

1554
01:45:57,505 --> 01:45:59,487
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have to concentrate on the road now.

1555
01:46:00,889 --> 01:46:01,289
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1556
01:46:02,370 --> 01:46:02,851
[SPEAKER_13]: Two words.

1557
01:46:03,091 --> 01:46:03,431
[SPEAKER_13]: One word.

1558
01:46:03,491 --> 01:46:04,012
[SPEAKER_13]: Compound.

1559
01:46:04,152 --> 01:46:04,613
[SPEAKER_13]: Headset.

1560
01:46:04,653 --> 01:46:07,916
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I just, you know, I hate it.

1561
01:46:08,076 --> 01:46:09,618
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate you guys driving me.

1562
01:46:10,692 --> 01:46:11,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1563
01:46:28,544 --> 01:46:32,725
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't understand why you have to send interns to a stupid competition like that.

1564
01:46:33,125 --> 01:46:34,786
[SPEAKER_08]: They have no opinion whatsoever.

1565
01:46:34,866 --> 01:46:38,907
[SPEAKER_08]: All they were doing was promoting some god knows whatever concert, and I forgot what it was.

1566
01:46:39,227 --> 01:46:40,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job on them.

1567
01:46:40,507 --> 01:46:41,688
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, let's get a look.

1568
01:46:42,268 --> 01:46:43,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Good Charlotte sucks ass.

1569
01:46:43,848 --> 01:46:52,451
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyways, you know, so they suck ass, and the fact that they have 1079 coming to promote their damn show, that's really sad.

1570
01:46:52,851 --> 01:46:57,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Then not only that, that stupid guy had no, you know, comments whatsoever, no constructive comments.

1571
01:46:58,487 --> 01:47:00,929
[SPEAKER_08]: I brought these people in the first place, so that sucks.

1572
01:47:01,689 --> 01:47:02,169
Ooh.

1573
01:47:02,229 --> 01:47:03,270
Ooh, cat fight.

1574
01:47:03,390 --> 01:47:05,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

1575
01:47:07,032 --> 01:47:08,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's even better.

1576
01:47:08,794 --> 01:47:11,495
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, yeah, after the fact that my...

1577
01:47:20,919 --> 01:47:23,600
[SPEAKER_08]: For some reason, my computer is running slow on the internet.

1578
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:34,745
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what the hell's up with our internet right now, and my PC, but the fact that I upgraded the RAM, upgraded the processor, upgraded the motherboard, and everything else does not make it run slow.

1579
01:47:34,805 --> 01:47:36,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Why does it run slow when you upgrade it?

1580
01:47:36,705 --> 01:47:37,546
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes no sense.

1581
01:47:38,206 --> 01:47:40,707
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I have to figure that one out.

1582
01:47:40,967 --> 01:47:45,109
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell is this?

1583
01:47:45,129 --> 01:47:47,670
[SPEAKER_08]: This is like some, like, Australian guy singing this.

1584
01:47:54,011 --> 01:47:54,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, crikey!

1585
01:47:55,532 --> 01:47:56,012
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Rudolph!

1586
01:47:56,072 --> 01:47:58,154
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going down in history!

1587
01:47:58,274 --> 01:47:59,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's awful.

1588
01:48:01,276 --> 01:48:07,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so that sucks, and... You know, I had lots of money this weekend, now it's all gone.

1589
01:48:08,260 --> 01:48:08,740
[SPEAKER_03]: More or less.

1590
01:48:09,501 --> 01:48:10,482
[SPEAKER_03]: So that sucks, too.

1591
01:48:12,123 --> 01:48:13,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm done.

1592
01:48:14,484 --> 01:48:14,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1593
01:48:15,685 --> 01:48:16,065
[SPEAKER_03]: For now.

1594
01:48:18,206 --> 01:48:18,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, my turn.

1595
01:48:20,572 --> 01:48:22,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, we get to hear Lion Suki again, even though we played it in that break.

1596
01:48:22,933 --> 01:48:25,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, by the way, was all Akira Yamaoka-related things.

1597
01:48:25,435 --> 01:48:28,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Rick, In My Eyes, Dancer, Duval, Lion Suki.

1598
01:48:29,217 --> 01:48:30,198
[SPEAKER_08]: All 2DX songs, too.

1599
01:48:31,719 --> 01:48:36,321
[SPEAKER_08]: My AFU this week goes to Live365.com, the lovely site that hosts our radio station.

1600
01:48:36,822 --> 01:48:42,105
[SPEAKER_08]: That MP3 Pro live shit was supposed to be rolled out at the end of October, and we're still waiting for it.

1601
01:48:43,105 --> 01:48:48,008
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was hoping we could have a live MP3 Pro stream starting Sunday, but that ain't gonna happen.

1602
01:48:48,048 --> 01:48:48,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

1603
01:48:48,248 --> 01:48:48,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Live365...

1604
01:48:49,838 --> 01:48:51,681
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't fucking get things out on time.

1605
01:48:52,162 --> 01:48:55,228
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope we don't get the plug pulled for me ranting on this on Life is Five.

1606
01:48:55,248 --> 01:48:57,111
[SPEAKER_08]: But hey, I'm entitled to my right of speech.

1607
01:49:00,232 --> 01:49:01,333
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just a little upset.

1608
01:49:01,353 --> 01:49:08,318
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm also upset at them because they're promoting the MP3 Pro thing all over the site when it's supposed to be in beta still.

1609
01:49:08,378 --> 01:49:10,560
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not supposed to be something that was rolled out to everybody.

1610
01:49:10,620 --> 01:49:16,404
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a piss poor thing to do to roll it out when half the people can't use it because the live software isn't rolled out yet.

1611
01:49:16,424 --> 01:49:24,891
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys suck that cock and balls and I hope you get your shit done soon before I come to wherever you're at and set your building on fire.

1612
01:49:24,911 --> 01:49:26,572
[SPEAKER_15]: You bet, Tom.

1613
01:49:27,145 --> 01:49:28,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I said come.

1614
01:49:30,848 --> 01:49:34,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, my other FUs of the week go to being single, because being single sucks.

1615
01:49:35,552 --> 01:49:43,819
[SPEAKER_08]: And my other FU goes to my job, because as much as I love my job, having to teach two classes at once is going to suck a fat cock.

1616
01:49:44,399 --> 01:49:46,141
[SPEAKER_08]: And, oh, I'm going to hug from Janae.

1617
01:49:46,942 --> 01:49:49,964
[SPEAKER_08]: All FU to Janae for having a vagina, not a penis.

1618
01:49:49,984 --> 01:49:52,386
[SPEAKER_11]: Same thing to Angel, yes, same thing.

1619
01:49:56,757 --> 01:49:57,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Just fuck women.

1620
01:49:58,319 --> 01:50:00,781
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, alright.

1621
01:50:01,241 --> 01:50:01,602
[SPEAKER_04]: That's enough.

1622
01:50:01,802 --> 01:50:05,605
[SPEAKER_04]: If you believe the fuck women, that's the idea.

1623
01:50:06,046 --> 01:50:06,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Catch on.

1624
01:50:08,087 --> 01:50:08,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1625
01:50:10,109 --> 01:50:11,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here we go.

1626
01:50:13,012 --> 01:50:14,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1627
01:50:15,875 --> 01:50:19,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Here comes the chatroom, not chatroom FUs, the rest of in-house FUs.

1628
01:50:19,178 --> 01:50:19,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Pixie Dust.

1629
01:50:23,033 --> 01:50:26,935
[SPEAKER_13]: F you goes to loaning friends money because they never pay you back.

1630
01:50:27,015 --> 01:50:27,696
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, ex-friends.

1631
01:50:28,156 --> 01:50:30,077
[SPEAKER_13]: Never pay you back because they're bastards.

1632
01:50:30,657 --> 01:50:31,998
[SPEAKER_13]: Or this person is a bastard.

1633
01:50:32,939 --> 01:50:34,199
[SPEAKER_13]: And, yeah, that's one thing.

1634
01:50:35,060 --> 01:50:38,942
[SPEAKER_13]: F you goes to the search for Miss Applebottom because it fucking sucks.

1635
01:50:39,502 --> 01:50:43,104
[SPEAKER_13]: Why the fuck are you going to tell Nelly that you can make your twat clap?

1636
01:50:43,585 --> 01:50:45,506
[SPEAKER_13]: What kind of thing does that do?

1637
01:50:49,261 --> 01:50:51,444
[SPEAKER_13]: What does it have to do with your butt?

1638
01:50:51,484 --> 01:50:52,845
[SPEAKER_08]: What does that sound like?

1639
01:50:53,746 --> 01:50:54,627
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me try, hold on.

1640
01:50:55,228 --> 01:50:59,894
[SPEAKER_08]: All I gotta say is that it'd be cool if we could do it in time with the Addams Family song.

1641
01:51:00,094 --> 01:51:01,195
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, no, clap.

1642
01:51:01,215 --> 01:51:02,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I had one more, fuck you.

1643
01:51:07,771 --> 01:51:08,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck you to Loki.

1644
01:51:09,352 --> 01:51:12,173
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to a fucking good Charlotte concert, you bastard.

1645
01:51:12,413 --> 01:51:13,593
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm glad about it.

1646
01:51:14,094 --> 01:51:16,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Go hang out with your 1079 cronies.

1647
01:51:17,715 --> 01:51:20,256
[SPEAKER_13]: These are going to be 106.5 cronies, bitch.

1648
01:51:20,977 --> 01:51:21,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God.

1649
01:51:22,117 --> 01:51:23,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Like there's a difference.

1650
01:51:23,578 --> 01:51:24,738
[SPEAKER_13]: There is a difference.

1651
01:51:25,599 --> 01:51:27,499
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't play Eminem on 1079.

1652
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:30,841
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck Tard.

1653
01:51:32,882 --> 01:51:33,342
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1654
01:51:33,542 --> 01:51:34,982
[SPEAKER_13]: Angel just said fuck Tard in my ear.

1655
01:51:35,523 --> 01:51:36,003
[SPEAKER_11]: Whoa, wait.

1656
01:51:37,068 --> 01:51:37,568
[SPEAKER_11]: I blame y'all.

1657
01:51:38,048 --> 01:51:41,790
[SPEAKER_13]: But, I'm, fuck you Ghost Nelly for smacking me on my ass.

1658
01:51:41,970 --> 01:51:44,631
[SPEAKER_13]: And, well, no wait.

1659
01:51:44,771 --> 01:51:47,313
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not supposed to!

1660
01:51:48,093 --> 01:51:49,634
[SPEAKER_13]: Not supposed to, but I liked it.

1661
01:51:49,954 --> 01:51:50,374
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1662
01:51:51,054 --> 01:51:52,575
[SPEAKER_13]: And, yeah.

1663
01:51:53,095 --> 01:51:56,657
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck having big tits, because I'm actually in studio and I can say that with Loki's face changed.

1664
01:51:56,677 --> 01:51:57,877
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, shut the fuck up.

1665
01:51:57,977 --> 01:51:59,858
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck having big tits.

1666
01:52:00,118 --> 01:52:01,279
[SPEAKER_13]: Jerks don't bait, you're right.

1667
01:52:01,949 --> 01:52:03,650
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, those aren't big tits.

1668
01:52:03,710 --> 01:52:08,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Big tits are like double G. That's like the stuff that you see on the Amorium.

1669
01:52:08,851 --> 01:52:09,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Shut the fuck up.

1670
01:52:11,892 --> 01:52:13,713
[SPEAKER_13]: They can hold an Xbox between them.

1671
01:52:13,773 --> 01:52:14,173
[SPEAKER_13]: Shut up.

1672
01:52:15,173 --> 01:52:17,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, that is so fake, okay?

1673
01:52:18,195 --> 01:52:20,735
[SPEAKER_08]: An Xbox can hold a small country in it, okay?

1674
01:52:21,856 --> 01:52:25,437
[SPEAKER_08]: I did not really mean you could put an Xbox on those boobs.

1675
01:52:26,457 --> 01:52:27,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Controller, maybe.

1676
01:52:27,678 --> 01:52:28,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Xbox, no.

1677
01:52:30,367 --> 01:52:32,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck, dude, I can't even fit an Xbox in my car.

1678
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:33,588
Okay.

1679
01:52:33,808 --> 01:52:36,450
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm done.

1680
01:52:37,190 --> 01:52:38,650
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, up next, no styling.

1681
01:52:39,091 --> 01:52:49,595
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, I usually have this huge, long FU for Sky, but now I don't have an FU except for those rocks in Sacramento.

1682
01:52:49,755 --> 01:52:52,196
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like, fuck you, rocks.

1683
01:52:53,316 --> 01:52:53,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Rock on.

1684
01:52:53,977 --> 01:52:54,857
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Angel.

1685
01:52:55,677 --> 01:52:57,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Your FU is for tonight, Angel.

1686
01:53:00,094 --> 01:53:01,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop laughing and rant about something.

1687
01:53:01,855 --> 01:53:03,396
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not a funny part of the show.

1688
01:53:03,436 --> 01:53:06,398
[SPEAKER_08]: You are not allowed to laugh.

1689
01:53:06,598 --> 01:53:07,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Shut up, Rob.

1690
01:53:08,539 --> 01:53:10,520
[SPEAKER_08]: PC Dust is balancing DNL on her boobs.

1691
01:53:10,540 --> 01:53:12,041
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why we're both laughing right now.

1692
01:53:14,422 --> 01:53:15,663
[SPEAKER_11]: But can you crush the can?

1693
01:53:15,683 --> 01:53:16,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Angel.

1694
01:53:17,124 --> 01:53:21,006
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, okay, okay.

1695
01:53:21,106 --> 01:53:25,249
[SPEAKER_14]: Um... Thank you to my work for not, um...

1696
01:53:26,391 --> 01:53:28,092
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.

1697
01:53:57,114 --> 01:53:59,576
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, I guess that's it, because I'm not that angsty this week.

1698
01:54:00,136 --> 01:54:01,137
[SPEAKER_14]: Surprisingly enough.

1699
01:54:06,541 --> 01:54:07,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1700
01:54:09,363 --> 01:54:11,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh-oh, uh-oh, here comes Loki again.

1701
01:54:14,206 --> 01:54:19,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you to the stupid goddamn commercials on the radio about some truck.

1702
01:54:20,331 --> 01:54:23,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't give a fuck if a black hole does not have a hemi.

1703
01:54:24,334 --> 01:54:24,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay?

1704
01:54:24,694 --> 01:54:24,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay?

1705
01:54:26,363 --> 01:54:33,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear to God, if I was that person in this fictitious commercial, I would have gutted those two people talking.

1706
01:54:33,907 --> 01:54:35,988
[SPEAKER_03]: I hated that commercial because it's so fucking annoying.

1707
01:54:36,028 --> 01:54:37,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I got a hemi, too!

1708
01:54:38,429 --> 01:54:39,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Look what I can do!

1709
01:54:39,390 --> 01:54:41,451
[SPEAKER_03]: How much does that black hole throw?

1710
01:54:41,471 --> 01:54:42,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it have a hemi?

1711
01:54:43,452 --> 01:54:44,652
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a redneck!

1712
01:54:45,033 --> 01:54:49,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Who fucks my own cousin?

1713
01:54:49,155 --> 01:54:50,475
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate that fucking commercial.

1714
01:54:50,755 --> 01:54:51,096
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all.

1715
01:54:51,256 --> 01:54:51,536
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm done.

1716
01:54:53,097 --> 01:54:53,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Magus.

1717
01:54:54,677 --> 01:54:57,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, this has been keeping me for most of the day.

1718
01:54:58,359 --> 01:55:08,186
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to the way that the swap room at Wreck-It-Con was designed, the way they had like the door guards and shit.

1719
01:55:09,166 --> 01:55:12,569
[SPEAKER_05]: There was one way in, one way out.

1720
01:55:13,109 --> 01:55:18,913
[SPEAKER_05]: You could not, you know, go out for like five seconds and then go back in the same door.

1721
01:55:19,073 --> 01:55:22,275
[SPEAKER_05]: You had to go all the way around the building and go back in.

1722
01:55:24,412 --> 01:55:25,413
[SPEAKER_05]: is just a pain in the ass.

1723
01:55:25,453 --> 01:55:28,115
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they had the long lines at the game room.

1724
01:55:31,557 --> 01:55:39,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Then, let's see, FU to Traffic getting into Pittsburgh for WreckerCon and FU to Fog on the way home.

1725
01:55:40,663 --> 01:55:41,023
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about it.

1726
01:55:41,043 --> 01:55:41,644
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not that anxious.

1727
01:55:41,664 --> 01:55:42,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thank God.

1728
01:55:42,164 --> 01:55:43,125
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad we left when we did.

1729
01:55:43,797 --> 01:55:44,277
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate fog.

1730
01:55:44,297 --> 01:55:45,418
[SPEAKER_08]: We took a secret way home.

1731
01:55:45,458 --> 01:55:47,639
[SPEAKER_08]: We went like, we went like on these back roads.

1732
01:55:47,679 --> 01:55:49,599
[SPEAKER_08]: We went up 4 and then we went up 160.

1733
01:55:49,659 --> 01:55:50,620
[SPEAKER_08]: We were like in the wilderness.

1734
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:51,500
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really scary.

1735
01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:52,761
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a secret to everybody.

1736
01:55:52,781 --> 01:55:54,561
[SPEAKER_08]: We went, we went by a town.

1737
01:55:56,282 --> 01:55:59,403
[SPEAKER_08]: We went by a town that has only 60 people that live in it.

1738
01:55:59,443 --> 01:55:59,944
[SPEAKER_08]: It was scary.

1739
01:56:02,045 --> 01:56:02,805
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it wasn't Susanville.

1740
01:56:03,185 --> 01:56:05,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's get to the chatroom FUs.

1741
01:56:18,661 --> 01:56:19,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, sorry.

1742
01:56:20,322 --> 01:56:22,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Captain Canada would like to give an FU to the week.

1743
01:56:22,243 --> 01:56:25,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Beer bottle caps for being so impossible to open without a bottle opener.

1744
01:56:26,186 --> 01:56:30,248
[SPEAKER_08]: And my roommate and myself for not having bottle opener in our dorm.

1745
01:56:30,288 --> 01:56:34,911
[SPEAKER_08]: It took me like ten minutes and a cut hand before I finally ripped the cap off with a pair of scissors.

1746
01:56:34,951 --> 01:56:38,012
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like sitting on the pot and then realizing there's no toilet paper.

1747
01:56:39,774 --> 01:56:41,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Wipe your ass with a shower curtain.

1748
01:56:46,821 --> 01:56:59,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Zodiac Knight would like to send a big F you to his school, the Illinois Institute of Technology, for being such money-grubbing whores who continue to not provide for their students.

1749
01:57:00,307 --> 01:57:02,508
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you can't say the school's name on the air, I understand.

1750
01:57:02,548 --> 01:57:02,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Oops.

1751
01:57:05,349 --> 01:57:06,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Zodiac Knight, by the way.

1752
01:57:09,122 --> 01:57:10,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, let's see.

1753
01:57:10,904 --> 01:57:17,148
[SPEAKER_08]: EvilNauki2DX would like to say, Fuck Seton Medical Center for not telling us that my grandmother suffers from anemia.

1754
01:57:17,208 --> 01:57:22,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks to those asshats, my grandmother is on life support and I have no fucking idea if she's going to live to see tomorrow.

1755
01:57:22,572 --> 01:57:25,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's too... That's sad.

1756
01:57:25,454 --> 01:57:33,279
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't supposed to be about sad things, but... I just... I hope things go better for you.

1757
01:57:34,972 --> 01:57:38,777
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Spector would like to say fuck you to Speed Mixes, especially Avril Lavigne Speed Mixes.

1758
01:57:38,817 --> 01:57:40,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck you to my Spanish teacher Lucretia again.

1759
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:43,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck you to Clock Tower 3, the suckiest game ever.

1760
01:57:44,024 --> 01:57:48,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck you to Politary, fuck you to IPL, fuck you to my dog who pissed in my room.

1761
01:57:52,166 --> 01:57:56,229
[SPEAKER_08]: ViolentHyperGirl would like to say F you to programming, the C language, pointers, and arrays.

1762
01:57:56,289 --> 01:58:03,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck you to my fan club who seem to show up at the arcade every time I show up and look like they're watching more than just me playing Initial D. They're watching your breasts, of course.

1763
01:58:03,855 --> 01:58:12,601
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to stalkers in general because they're giving ex-C9CNME creepy looks in terms of smiling and trying to be friendly when it's creepy as fuck.

1764
01:58:12,621 --> 01:58:16,143
[SPEAKER_08]: And F you to midterms because of those I haven't been to be able to go to Orange Lounge Radio.

1765
01:58:18,045 --> 01:58:19,746
[SPEAKER_08]: And I miss the Orange Lounge Radio crew, so yeah.

1766
01:58:20,857 --> 01:58:30,161
[SPEAKER_08]: XVI, as he's known, is tuning in from Las Vegas tonight and would like to give an FU of the week to the manager of the virtual reality zone at the Adventure Dome at Circus Circus in Las Vegas.

1767
01:58:30,621 --> 01:58:33,743
[SPEAKER_08]: That was one of the first places I ever played VR, FYI.

1768
01:58:33,763 --> 01:58:40,246
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't fix their Romani machines, so many locals accuse the workers of their being lazy-ass bastards when it's actually the manager who's to be blamed for it.

1769
01:58:40,906 --> 01:58:42,788
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to myself for being left out of Too Much.

1770
01:58:42,828 --> 01:58:46,192
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to get out of Las Vegas so I can be back with my friends, back with the RTA crew.

1771
01:58:46,733 --> 01:58:52,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Also F you to the Las Vegas bus system known as Cat for making such lame excuses and mostly not on fucking time on their schedules.

1772
01:58:55,082 --> 01:59:00,448
[SPEAKER_08]: S Ghost would like to say F you to you guys for airing erotic songs when my parents invited over a pastor.

1773
01:59:02,415 --> 01:59:04,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Good thing I'm an atheist or else I'd be headed straight to hell.

1774
01:59:05,337 --> 01:59:13,124
[SPEAKER_08]: On the subject of religion, F you to that one pastor who wants to put a memorial in Matthew Shepard's town that says Matthew Shepard entered hell, whatever the name, whatever the date was.

1775
01:59:14,004 --> 01:59:16,366
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the guy who runs GodHatesFags.com.

1776
01:59:16,406 --> 01:59:16,867
[SPEAKER_08]: What's his name?

1777
01:59:16,967 --> 01:59:17,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Fred Phelps, I think.

1778
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:22,291
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's a total asshat who's just an attention whore, and that's how he does it, by fag-bashing.

1779
01:59:22,351 --> 01:59:27,235
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why we don't like to acknowledge that he exists, because sick people like that don't exist in my world.

1780
01:59:27,976 --> 01:59:31,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Be sure to tune in to his show, The 700 Club, on the Family Channel.

1781
01:59:33,088 --> 01:59:37,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, weekdays at 11.

1782
01:59:37,689 --> 01:59:42,111
[SPEAKER_08]: 700 Club, great material for having friends over and wanting to talk about something.

1783
01:59:43,991 --> 01:59:52,333
[SPEAKER_08]: S-Ghost, F you to whoever made the horrible S-Ghost parody journal on LiveJournal, which is that LiveJournal user, S-Ghost.

1784
01:59:52,513 --> 01:59:54,734
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to Good Charlotte and all that punk crap.

1785
01:59:54,774 --> 01:59:56,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Punk isn't dead, it just sucks now.

1786
01:59:57,395 --> 01:59:58,675

2016
02:26:09,130 --> 02:26:10,892
[SPEAKER_13]: I've got a plate, so I have a reason.

2017
02:26:11,212 --> 02:26:15,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, basically, since we're kind of, uh, this isn't a popular segment with our chat room.

2018
02:26:16,015 --> 02:26:19,877
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I got the equivalent of a C. I don't know.

2019
02:26:20,637 --> 02:26:23,579
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll let one more person go, and then we'll judge where we're at.

2020
02:26:23,599 --> 02:26:26,521
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Janae, why don't you, uh, pixie dust, why don't you take over.

2021
02:26:26,961 --> 02:26:31,544
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, if the chat room says, please, Lord, pull the plug, after Janae, we'll stop this segment.

2022
02:26:31,564 --> 02:26:32,144
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, guys.

2023
02:26:32,164 --> 02:26:34,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, we're putting Loki on stage.

2024
02:26:34,546 --> 02:26:36,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Guys, let me explain something to the chat room.

2025
02:26:36,787 --> 02:26:44,469
[SPEAKER_08]: You have the lines that dictate what pitch you sing at, so I had to find myself constantly adjusting my pitch.

2026
02:26:44,529 --> 02:26:48,110
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't, like, go my own way, you know.

2027
02:26:49,230 --> 02:26:55,072
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I suck at DDR freestyle, but I can actually sing on my own pretty well.

2028
02:26:56,292 --> 02:26:58,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, what song are you going to do, Janae?

2029

[SPEAKER_08]: Here she goes.

2033
02:27:10,836 --> 02:27:12,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, you want to kind of keep the green arrow on the blue bar.

2034
02:27:14,457 --> 02:27:14,857
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

[SPEAKER_08]: So, No Stylin', what song are you going to do?

2130

2156
02:38:26,939 --> 02:38:47,145
[SPEAKER_19]: It must be happy cold there in my soul To never have some light on your face Your word content to let me shine

2157
02:38:50,652 --> 02:39:20,215
[SPEAKER_19]: You always walk the step with me So I was the one with the whole body While you were the one with all the strength A beautiful face without a name For so long

2158
02:39:21,215 --> 02:39:23,737
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching.

02:41:28,759 --> 02:41:32,522
For you are the wind beneath my wings.

[SPEAKER_11]: Because you are the wind beneath my wings.

2167
02:41:36,505 --> 02:41:39,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you are the wind beneath my wings.

2168
02:41:57,483 --> 02:42:06,106
[SPEAKER_11]: NoStylen has failed his song!

2169
02:42:06,326 --> 02:42:14,228
[SPEAKER_11]: With 2,146 points, NoStylen failed Wind Beneath My Wings, and Teninga has broken down on stage and cried.

2170
02:42:24,691 --> 02:42:25,111
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2171
02:42:26,292 --> 02:42:27,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Here you go, you guys.

2172
02:42:27,713 --> 02:42:28,493
[SPEAKER_08]: This is how it's going to work.

2173
02:42:28,513 --> 02:42:29,874
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are going to vote for a winner.

2174
02:42:29,954 --> 02:42:36,117
[SPEAKER_08]: The winner will come back and sing an encore song, which will be selected at random by the game.

2175
02:42:36,637 --> 02:42:38,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless it's a song that we've already done.

2176
02:42:38,898 --> 02:42:40,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we'll back out and pick a different one, okay?

2177
02:42:40,979 --> 02:42:41,480
[SPEAKER_08]: So here we go.

2178
02:42:41,780 --> 02:42:43,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Just put it in the chat room, all in caps.

2179
02:42:44,501 --> 02:42:45,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Who you want the winner to be.

2180
02:42:45,962 --> 02:42:47,622
[SPEAKER_08]: You can vote for me.

2181
02:42:47,982 --> 02:42:49,303
[SPEAKER_08]: I sang Like a Virgin.

[SPEAKER_08]: You can vote for Magus, who sang Power of Love.

2183
02:42:53,764 --> 02:42:57,905
[SPEAKER_08]: You can vote for Pixie Dust, who sang... What the hell did you sing?

2184
02:42:57,945 --> 02:42:58,666
[SPEAKER_08]: I forgot already.

2185
02:42:59,046 --> 02:42:59,966
[SPEAKER_08]: You sang Don't Know Why.

2186
02:42:59,986 --> 02:43:00,846
[SPEAKER_08]: You sang the Noah Jones one.

2187
02:43:01,266 --> 02:43:04,948
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can vote for Loki, who sang Complicated, at your request.

2188
02:43:05,388 --> 02:43:08,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Or you can vote for No Stylin', who sang Wind Beneath My Wings.

2189
02:43:08,669 --> 02:43:08,989
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

2190
02:43:10,020 --> 02:43:15,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Put all in caps right now who you want to sing again and who will play a random song.

2191
02:43:16,344 --> 02:43:19,826
[SPEAKER_08]: We see some Rob, some Nostalin.

2192
02:43:20,406 --> 02:43:24,328
[SPEAKER_13]: There's going to be a tie between Loki and Nostalin.

2193
02:43:24,688 --> 02:43:25,749
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what it's going to be.

2194
02:43:26,569 --> 02:43:27,290
[SPEAKER_13]: I predicted.

2195
02:43:27,670 --> 02:43:31,312
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, you guys have a minute to flood our screen with your votes.

2196
02:43:31,372 --> 02:43:34,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry against people who don't like flooding, but...

2197
02:43:35,382 --> 02:43:40,463
[SPEAKER_08]: But my inbox is already full of your Ask Orange Lawrence questions, which we probably won't get to now.

2198
02:43:42,163 --> 02:43:42,844
[SPEAKER_13]: I love Angel.

2199
02:43:42,864 --> 02:43:43,264
[SPEAKER_13]: She voted for me.

2200
02:43:43,324 --> 02:43:44,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, we see some Janae's.

2201
02:43:44,684 --> 02:43:46,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm starting to see some Loki's.

2202
02:43:47,965 --> 02:43:50,845
[SPEAKER_08]: No, there's about four lines for Loki.

2203
02:43:51,565 --> 02:43:53,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Victor, no styling.

2204
02:43:54,726 --> 02:43:55,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

2205
02:43:56,926 --> 02:43:57,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki wins.

2206
02:43:57,967 --> 02:43:58,567
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki...

2207
02:44:02,606 --> 02:44:04,067
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, it's kind of close, you guys.

2208
02:44:04,127 --> 02:44:06,429
[SPEAKER_08]: It's between me, Loki, and Nostyle, and what do you think?

2209
02:44:07,149 --> 02:44:07,910
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you guys think?

2210
02:44:08,270 --> 02:44:09,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you guys!

02:44:09,491 --> 02:44:10,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Fucking didn't vote for me, you cunts!

[SPEAKER_13]: I did, me!

2214
02:44:16,776 --> 02:44:17,216
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

2215
02:44:17,236 --> 02:44:18,237
[SPEAKER_10]: One fucking vote, you cunts!

2216
02:44:18,257 --> 02:44:20,258
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking Loki is the winner, okay?

2217
02:44:20,298 --> 02:44:23,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki is going to do an encore presentation right now.

2218
02:44:23,280 --> 02:44:24,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki is the winner!

2219
02:44:25,001 --> 02:44:25,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn it!

2220
02:44:25,662 --> 02:44:26,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Red wine.

2221
02:44:26,202 --> 02:44:26,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Red wine.

2222
02:44:26,482 --> 02:44:26,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2223
02:44:27,923 --> 02:44:28,504
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I know.

2224
02:44:28,524 --> 02:44:29,545
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm coming out!

2225
02:44:29,605 --> 02:44:29,905
[SPEAKER_09]: No!

2226
02:44:32,661 --> 02:44:36,884
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, it's going to be randomly selected by the computer.

2227
02:44:37,324 --> 02:44:39,005
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be randomly selected by the computer.

2228
02:44:39,245 --> 02:44:43,267
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's a song we've already heard, we're going to cancel it out and do a different one because we want to hear something new.

2229
02:44:43,848 --> 02:44:44,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, ready Loki?

2230
02:44:46,149 --> 02:44:46,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2231
02:44:50,992 --> 02:44:53,613
[SPEAKER_08]: This is no scoring mode, it's just plain karaoke fun.

2232
02:44:53,713 --> 02:44:55,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, no wait, no, we'll do, I'm sorry.

2233
02:44:55,835 --> 02:44:58,116
[SPEAKER_08]: No wait, I don't remember how to get it to select random now.

2234
02:44:58,866 --> 02:44:59,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, you ready, Loki?

2235
02:45:00,266 --> 02:45:02,247
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to pick one completely at random.

2236
02:45:02,307 --> 02:45:05,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Here is the song Loki will be singing as his encore.

2237
02:45:05,467 --> 02:45:10,248
[SPEAKER_08]: The wheel is spinning, and it's landing on... It's the end of the world as we know it.

2238
02:45:11,188 --> 02:45:11,588
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2239
02:45:13,248 --> 02:45:13,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

2240
02:45:14,809 --> 02:45:17,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki's singing It's the End of the World as We Know It at the county fair.

2241
02:45:17,509 --> 02:45:17,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy.

2242
02:45:20,410 --> 02:45:21,130
Why?

2243
02:45:21,170 --> 02:45:22,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's sing along.

2244
02:45:28,962 --> 02:45:30,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, let's sing along.

2245
02:45:30,303 --> 02:45:33,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, group sing along.

2246
02:45:33,585 --> 02:45:34,425
[SPEAKER_03]: I am so not singing this song.

2247
02:45:34,445 --> 02:45:36,666
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like this song.

2248
02:45:36,906 --> 02:45:39,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't work with this.

2249
02:45:58,231 --> 02:45:59,072
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't hit the pitch.

2250
02:46:04,415 --> 02:46:05,296
[SPEAKER_03]: They're too fast!

2251
02:46:05,476 --> 02:46:07,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me a different song, come on, seriously.

2252
02:46:07,798 --> 02:46:09,539
[SPEAKER_03]: This is ridiculous, I can't work with this.

2253
02:46:09,559 --> 02:46:13,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Loki is about to fail, it's the end of the world as we know it, and he wants a different song.

2254
02:46:13,182 --> 02:46:15,103
[SPEAKER_08]: That means we are going to pick the song for him.

2255
02:46:16,604 --> 02:46:18,345
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't work with this, this is too fast.

2256
02:46:26,972 --> 02:46:32,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, since Loki failed that song miserably, we're going to pick a song for him.

2257
02:46:32,694 --> 02:46:34,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we're not going to let him get away with it that way.

2258
02:46:34,475 --> 02:46:35,956
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you guys say?

2259
02:46:36,036 --> 02:46:36,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Believe?

2260
02:46:36,816 --> 02:46:39,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a... Girls just want to have a... Alright, I'm coming out.

2261
02:46:39,877 --> 02:46:40,457
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm coming out.

2262
02:46:40,497 --> 02:46:40,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Here it is.

2263
02:46:41,258 --> 02:46:42,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki singing, I'm coming out.

2264
02:46:44,719 --> 02:46:46,139
[SPEAKER_08]: At the county fair with Teninga.

2265
02:46:46,760 --> 02:46:47,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

2266
02:46:48,200 --> 02:46:50,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, he goes, I'm coming out.

2267
02:46:50,461 --> 02:46:50,681
[SPEAKER_08]: You know?

2268
02:46:50,841 --> 02:46:51,341
[SPEAKER_08]: You know how it goes?

2269
02:46:51,462 --> 02:46:52,082
[SPEAKER_08]: You know how this one goes?

2270
02:46:52,122 --> 02:46:52,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, here we go.

[SPEAKER_11]: Stop making me laugh dammit!

2275
02:48:03,172 --> 02:48:05,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Breaking out of the shell.

2276
02:48:06,413 --> 02:48:09,895
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to shout that I'm staying in.

2277

[SPEAKER_03]: I want the world to know I'm happy with the pussy.

[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, oh yeah.

[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sick of this song.

2290
02:50:09,149 --> 02:50:11,050
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna really die.

2291
02:50:13,172 --> 02:50:14,593
[SPEAKER_03]: God, this is long.

2292
02:50:15,174 --> 02:50:17,476
[SPEAKER_03]: It just doesn't fucking end.

2293
02:50:17,796 --> 02:50:19,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Just keeps on going on.

2294
02:50:22,100 --> 02:50:24,462
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna kill anyone in the chatroom that has a recording of this.

2295
02:50:24,682 --> 02:50:25,743
[SPEAKER_08]: You're gonna so die.

2296
02:50:26,283 --> 02:50:27,324
[SPEAKER_08]: I know where you live.

2297
02:50:28,345 --> 02:50:31,468
[SPEAKER_08]: As a reminder, the show will be broadcast this week on Thursday.

2298
02:50:34,789 --> 02:50:37,932
[SPEAKER_08]: A score of 6,964 points for Loki.

2299
02:50:37,992 --> 02:50:39,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Not even a gold record.

2300
02:50:39,874 --> 02:50:41,336
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no justice in this world.

2301
02:50:41,416 --> 02:50:41,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2302
02:50:43,157 --> 02:50:45,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we're going to shut the game off now.

2303
02:50:45,259 --> 02:50:47,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, I have not laughed that hard.

2304
02:50:47,441 --> 02:50:49,183
[SPEAKER_00]: I laughed so hard my head scared.

2305
02:50:49,203 --> 02:50:50,925
[SPEAKER_08]: I laughed so hard I peed, okay?

2306
02:50:51,285 --> 02:50:52,106
[SPEAKER_08]: I peed a little.

2307
02:50:53,167 --> 02:50:54,188
[SPEAKER_08]: I peed a little bit.

2308
02:50:55,228 --> 02:51:01,130
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't with my jaw anymore, so no sex tonight, huh, Rob?

2309
02:51:01,830 --> 02:51:03,230
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that hurt so bad.

2310
02:51:03,490 --> 02:51:04,791
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, my God.

2311
02:51:07,111 --> 02:51:08,732
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't believe you.

2312
02:51:09,092 --> 02:51:09,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2313
02:51:09,912 --> 02:51:11,853
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it is.

2314
02:51:13,673 --> 02:51:15,614
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have been like, I'm sliding in.

2315
02:51:15,694 --> 02:51:16,674
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that would have been even better.

2316
02:51:16,914 --> 02:51:17,674
[SPEAKER_08]: But, all right.

2317
02:51:19,275 --> 02:51:19,715
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2318
02:51:21,295 --> 02:51:26,081
[SPEAKER_08]: Luckily, the one person that Loki forgets has a recording is me.

2319
02:51:26,662 --> 02:51:27,042
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2320
02:51:29,205 --> 02:51:32,108
[SPEAKER_08]: My hair looks so bad.

2321
02:51:32,148 --> 02:51:35,012
[SPEAKER_08]: We might run a little bit over tonight, but I don't think anybody cares after that.

2322
02:51:35,232 --> 02:51:38,076
[SPEAKER_08]: And to think, you guys wanted to end the segment before Loki sang.

2323
02:51:39,534 --> 02:51:40,635
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we should make him sing again.

2324
02:51:41,035 --> 02:51:43,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, come on.

2325
02:51:44,337 --> 02:51:45,818
[SPEAKER_13]: It should be... Okay, I got it.

2326
02:51:45,838 --> 02:51:46,958
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to have to be a bit.

2327
02:51:47,018 --> 02:51:49,100
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the only reason people are going to tune into our show now.

2328
02:51:49,780 --> 02:51:52,922
[SPEAKER_13]: It should be a duo between Victor and Loki.

2329
02:51:53,022 --> 02:51:53,522
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

2330
02:51:53,762 --> 02:51:57,364
[SPEAKER_08]: When the Karaoke Revolution expansion pack comes out, Loki will sing again.

2331
02:51:57,804 --> 02:52:01,286
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you're my fucking monkey, Loki will sing when I tell you to.

2332
02:52:01,306 --> 02:52:02,927
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just kidding.

2333
02:52:02,947 --> 02:52:03,708
[SPEAKER_13]: Dance, monkey, dance.

2334
02:52:04,289 --> 02:52:07,354
[SPEAKER_08]: What we're going to do when the expansion pack comes out, we'll do this again.

2335
02:52:08,496 --> 02:52:10,779
[SPEAKER_08]: This is more incentive for Konami to get those expansion packs out.

2336
02:52:12,181 --> 02:52:12,923
[SPEAKER_08]: As promised...

2337
02:52:17,069 --> 02:52:17,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god.

2338
02:52:20,211 --> 02:52:23,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

2339
02:52:23,692 --> 02:52:26,974
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea how we're going to follow that segment, but we'll sure try.

2340
02:52:27,394 --> 02:52:28,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Will Pixie Dust take her top off?

2341
02:52:29,335 --> 02:52:30,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Will Magus take his pants off?

2342
02:52:31,316 --> 02:52:31,996
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope not.

2343
02:52:32,156 --> 02:52:34,337
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be a side to make me blind.

2344
02:52:35,118 --> 02:52:37,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2345
02:52:37,138 --> 02:52:37,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

2346
02:52:37,699 --> 02:52:39,720
[SPEAKER_08]: First question tonight, ask Orange Lounge.

2347
02:52:43,802 --> 02:52:44,562
[SPEAKER_08]: What happened?

2348
02:52:45,122 --> 02:52:46,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, I guess I missed it.

2349
02:52:47,287 --> 02:52:47,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

2350
02:52:49,228 --> 02:52:50,209
[SPEAKER_08]: First question.

2351
02:52:51,930 --> 02:52:55,692
[SPEAKER_08]: First question from... I can't find... Okay, here we go.

2352
02:52:55,752 --> 02:53:00,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Leadfoot would like to know, How did Mobomoga get into Xtreme and which one of you made it?

2353
02:53:01,496 --> 02:53:02,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Good, thank God.

2354
02:53:02,777 --> 02:53:04,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Mobomoga is by The Orange Lounge.

2355
02:53:05,699 --> 02:53:10,482
[SPEAKER_08]: And it got into Xtreme because Konami got cheap and stopped licensing things.

2356
02:53:10,742 --> 02:53:11,863
[SPEAKER_07]: One more time, he says.

2357
02:53:12,203 --> 02:53:13,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo, I saw her boobies!

2358
02:53:13,624 --> 02:53:13,884
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2359
02:53:14,893 --> 02:53:17,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Ledford would also like to know, what happened to Orange Crush?

2360
02:53:17,756 --> 02:53:19,697
[SPEAKER_08]: That was kind of a regular segment we had on the show.

2361
02:53:19,757 --> 02:53:21,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's Rice Princess's thing.

2362
02:53:22,320 --> 02:53:27,064
[SPEAKER_08]: And since she's not really on the show much anymore, because she spends a lot of time coming over for Vanilla Sky.

2363
02:53:27,384 --> 02:53:29,906
[SPEAKER_08]: But of course, Rice Princess, always welcome at the show.

2364
02:53:30,026 --> 02:53:32,669
[SPEAKER_08]: And if she comes back, I'm hoping she'll bring some Orange Crush with her.

2365
02:53:33,570 --> 02:53:40,596
[SPEAKER_08]: A good substitute would always be Vanilla Sky Video Game Trivia, which you can hear on Vanilla Sky, which is the bad music and video game trivia.

2366
02:53:42,401 --> 02:53:42,661
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2367
02:53:43,963 --> 02:53:44,743
[SPEAKER_08]: So, let's see.

2368
02:53:46,605 --> 02:53:52,270
[SPEAKER_08]: XVI would like to know, what songs do you guys look forward to playing on Guitar Freak 10th or Drum Mania 9th Mix?

2369
02:53:53,151 --> 02:53:53,751
[SPEAKER_08]: None of them.

2370
02:53:53,831 --> 02:53:54,372
[SPEAKER_08]: None of them.

2371
02:53:54,472 --> 02:53:56,874
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same fucking game over and over.

2372
02:53:57,415 --> 02:53:59,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe the Weezer song, One Time, for Shits and Giggles.

2373
02:54:00,097 --> 02:54:00,838
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that would be about it.

2374
02:54:01,018 --> 02:54:03,580
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to play Mad Blast, but that wasn't on this one.

2375
02:54:03,600 --> 02:54:04,321
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it was.

2376
02:54:05,702 --> 02:54:06,002
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2377
02:54:07,384 --> 02:54:08,765
[SPEAKER_08]: John Fields would like to know, Loki...

2378
02:54:09,531 --> 02:54:12,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Which Beatmania sim do you prefer, and why do you prefer it over the other?

2379
02:54:12,892 --> 02:54:14,752
[SPEAKER_08]: BM98 or Beatmania DX?

2380
02:54:15,032 --> 02:54:19,973
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't play Beatmania sims, but I play the emulators, so that was kind of cool.

2381
02:54:20,793 --> 02:54:25,654
[SPEAKER_08]: But I was using a, what was it, Beatmania DX, whatever that is.

2382
02:54:26,215 --> 02:54:28,975
[SPEAKER_08]: There's actually another one, too, that not many people know of.

2383
02:54:29,035 --> 02:54:32,716
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't remember what exactly the name of it was, because I had the link on my old computer.

2384
02:54:32,756 --> 02:54:37,877
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's another sim out there that's comparable to Beatmania DX, so...

2385
02:54:38,792 --> 02:54:40,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, cool.

2386
02:54:40,534 --> 02:54:41,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Question from Jay Kinetic.

2387
02:54:42,695 --> 02:54:43,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Astroglide or KY?

2388
02:54:43,956 --> 02:54:44,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Astroglide.

2389
02:54:46,078 --> 02:54:47,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Pixie Dust says Astroglide.

2390
02:54:49,120 --> 02:54:49,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Nelly says KY.

2391
02:54:49,861 --> 02:54:51,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Warming liquid.

2392
02:54:51,402 --> 02:54:52,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Warming liquid, says Nelly.

2393
02:54:53,344 --> 02:54:57,167
[SPEAKER_08]: I say choice number three, ID, which most of you have probably never heard of.

2394
02:54:59,048 --> 02:54:59,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Janae knows of it.

2395
02:55:01,410 --> 02:55:02,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody else care to answer this question?

2396
02:55:04,112 --> 02:55:05,113
[SPEAKER_08]: No, alright then, moving on.

2397
02:55:09,238 --> 02:55:15,101
[SPEAKER_08]: S-Ghost would like to know, what package are you guys using for Live 365?

2398
02:55:15,461 --> 02:55:18,043
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to start up a station and you seem to have a good thing going.

2399
02:55:18,083 --> 02:55:18,443
[SPEAKER_08]: P.S.

2400
02:55:18,503 --> 02:55:20,724
[SPEAKER_08]: I won't be playing anything on Sunday night, so you know.

2401
02:55:21,464 --> 02:55:27,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Without getting into too many specifics, I can talk about this more with you offline, but we have the personal broadcaster package.

2402
02:55:27,187 --> 02:55:30,929
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't run as a commercial station because we don't run our own in-house ads or anything like that.

2403
02:55:31,309 --> 02:55:36,732
[SPEAKER_08]: and we don't really have that many people that listen that necessitate us needing hundreds of simultaneous listeners.

2404
02:55:37,973 --> 02:55:39,414
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have one of the personal packages.

2405
02:55:39,434 --> 02:55:41,575
[SPEAKER_08]: I can give you the specifics offline.

2406
02:55:42,376 --> 02:55:44,677
[SPEAKER_08]: He says he wants to do his own station.

2407
02:55:46,018 --> 02:55:47,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, sure, why not?

2408
02:55:47,359 --> 02:55:48,059
[SPEAKER_08]: The more the merrier.

2409
02:55:48,400 --> 02:55:50,461
[SPEAKER_08]: But you start a live talk show, I'll kill you.

2410
02:55:50,661 --> 02:55:51,261
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just kidding.

2411
02:55:51,662 --> 02:55:52,042
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kidding.

2412
02:55:53,783 --> 02:55:56,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they were voting for the song they wanted you to sing, Loki.

2413
02:55:56,345 --> 02:55:57,025
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I have all the PMs.

2414
02:55:58,199 --> 02:56:01,841
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of the personal broadcaster packages and it's reasonable, I guess.

2415
02:56:01,981 --> 02:56:04,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Although I don't like the idea of having to pay to do this show.

2416
02:56:04,982 --> 02:56:07,083
[SPEAKER_08]: But whatever, we have fun doing it and that's what it's all about.

2417
02:56:08,584 --> 02:56:12,726
[SPEAKER_08]: EvilMaliki2DX would like to know, when are you coming over to clean my house and the plumbing?

2418
02:56:13,806 --> 02:56:15,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Anytime, anyplace, baby.

2419
02:56:20,441 --> 02:56:20,822
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

2420
02:56:20,862 --> 02:56:23,644
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm out of questions unless somebody else wants to send along a new question.

2421
02:56:23,724 --> 02:56:28,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, we probably should start to get wrapping up the show pretty soon here.

2422
02:56:29,028 --> 02:56:32,611
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm having a lot of people ask me for a copy of the Karaoke Revolution segment.

2423
02:56:32,931 --> 02:56:34,252
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you guys think we ought to do with that?

2424
02:56:35,053 --> 02:56:36,894
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking burn it.

2425
02:56:37,054 --> 02:56:38,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Sell it on eBay, the highest bidder.

2426
02:56:39,776 --> 02:56:40,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Kazaa.

2427
02:56:40,497 --> 02:56:41,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Put it on Kazaa.

2428
02:56:41,838 --> 02:56:42,458
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see what happens.

2429
02:56:42,498 --> 02:56:43,779
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it could be a good promotion show.

2430
02:56:44,560 --> 02:56:47,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki and I have been busting our butts trying to get a new website done.

2431
02:56:49,489 --> 02:56:50,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

2432
02:56:50,609 --> 02:56:55,510
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we have that new website done in our downloads area, we will put that up just for you guys.

2433
02:56:56,970 --> 02:56:57,630
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

2434
02:56:58,331 --> 02:56:59,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we'll have like... You know what?

2435
02:56:59,651 --> 02:57:01,531
[SPEAKER_08]: We should get ourselves like a listeners club.

2436
02:57:02,451 --> 02:57:04,252
[SPEAKER_08]: An Orange Lounge listeners club.

2437
02:57:05,672 --> 02:57:06,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2438
02:57:06,612 --> 02:57:08,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we have a message board, but none of us seem to use it.

2439
02:57:08,832 --> 02:57:12,773
[SPEAKER_08]: But it is over at KaliBomani.com if you click on the evil board of randomness.

2440
02:57:13,453 --> 02:57:15,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, our forums have been a little dead lately.

2441
02:57:16,014 --> 02:57:17,754
[SPEAKER_08]: But you can go there and revive them.

2442
02:57:17,854 --> 02:57:18,634
[SPEAKER_08]: We certainly wouldn't mind.

2443
02:57:20,603 --> 02:57:22,424
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm making a sexy pose for Pixie Dust right now.

2444
02:57:26,225 --> 02:57:27,866
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just showing off my pillowy lips.

2445
02:57:28,626 --> 02:57:28,986
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2446
02:57:30,007 --> 02:57:33,508
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess we're going to close the mailbag now for Ask Orange Lodge.

2447
02:57:39,662 --> 02:57:42,785
[SPEAKER_08]: That was Orange Lounge, or should I say Ask Orange Lounge.

2448
02:57:43,125 --> 02:57:46,388
[SPEAKER_08]: The segment's over now, so don't send any more questions.

2449
02:57:46,909 --> 02:57:50,272
[SPEAKER_08]: We hope you learned something really useful.

2450
02:57:50,692 --> 02:57:53,715
[SPEAKER_08]: The show's over, so we're going to end the segment right now.

2451
02:57:54,396 --> 02:57:54,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2452
02:57:58,480 --> 02:58:02,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Now's the part of the show where we go around and we get everybody's final thoughts.

2453
02:58:04,685 --> 02:58:06,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's start with No Stalin.

2454
02:58:07,548 --> 02:58:08,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for coming tonight, No Stalin.

2455
02:58:08,769 --> 02:58:09,690
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it was your first show.

2456
02:58:10,270 --> 02:58:12,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of an interesting show to have as your first show.

2457
02:58:12,653 --> 02:58:14,014
[SPEAKER_15]: I really like the show, you know.

2458
02:58:14,494 --> 02:58:14,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.

2459
02:58:14,995 --> 02:58:16,556
[SPEAKER_15]: Really random and me showing up.

2460
02:58:17,277 --> 02:58:17,637
[SPEAKER_15]: It's cool.

2461
02:58:17,838 --> 02:58:18,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

2462
02:58:18,518 --> 02:58:19,599
[SPEAKER_15]: Good times.

2463
02:58:19,639 --> 02:58:20,180
[SPEAKER_15]: Good times.

2464
02:58:20,340 --> 02:58:21,301
[SPEAKER_15]: GT, I like to say.

2465
02:58:21,341 --> 02:58:21,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2466
02:58:21,781 --> 02:58:22,302
[SPEAKER_15]: Your mom.

2467
02:58:25,965 --> 02:58:26,306
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2468
02:58:31,574 --> 02:58:33,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, God, that over.

2469
02:58:33,575 --> 02:58:34,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Pixie Dust, your final thought.

2470
02:58:35,435 --> 02:58:41,697
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm laying on the 23rd Magnus, or 69 Magnus, in a salon right now.

2471
02:58:41,897 --> 02:58:43,697
[SPEAKER_13]: I am such a slut, aren't I?

2472
02:58:44,037 --> 02:58:45,698
[SPEAKER_13]: But only one comes home with me tonight.

2473
02:58:47,278 --> 02:58:47,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Well.

2474
02:58:48,638 --> 02:58:49,258
[SPEAKER_13]: That's Rob.

2475
02:58:49,819 --> 02:58:50,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that's me.

2476
02:58:50,399 --> 02:58:50,919
[SPEAKER_08]: I get to come home.

2477
02:58:51,599 --> 02:58:52,659
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm getting a restraining order.

2478
02:58:54,060 --> 02:58:54,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

2479
02:58:54,660 --> 02:58:55,460
[SPEAKER_13]: You fuck face.

2480
02:58:57,282 --> 02:58:59,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, um, let's see.

2481
02:59:00,304 --> 02:59:01,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, moving on.

2482
02:59:01,685 --> 02:59:03,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, Magus, your final thought for tonight.

2483
02:59:03,847 --> 02:59:05,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Why'd you have to go ahead and make things so complicated?

2484
02:59:05,528 --> 02:59:08,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Angel, Angel, your final thought for tonight.

2485
02:59:09,370 --> 02:59:10,691
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't think of one, damn you.

2486
02:59:11,532 --> 02:59:12,252
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm coming out.

2487
02:59:12,733 --> 02:59:13,633
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god, it's a milkshake!

2488
02:59:14,754 --> 02:59:16,295
[SPEAKER_11]: Milkshake!

2489
02:59:16,435 --> 02:59:17,896
[SPEAKER_11]: Cheeseburger!

2490
02:59:18,036 --> 02:59:19,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, Loki, your final thought.

2491
02:59:20,658 --> 02:59:21,779
I want to sing it to you.

2492
02:59:22,019 --> 02:59:22,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Here it comes.

2493
02:59:22,960 --> 02:59:24,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki's going to sing his final thought tonight.

2494
02:59:24,481 --> 02:59:24,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2495
02:59:27,515 --> 02:59:28,676
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not.

2496
02:59:28,736 --> 02:59:30,157
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to sing my final thought.

2497
02:59:30,197 --> 02:59:33,139
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell is this wrapped around?

2498
02:59:33,500 --> 02:59:34,220
[SPEAKER_08]: What the fuck?

2499
02:59:35,942 --> 02:59:36,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

2500
02:59:36,342 --> 02:59:38,664
[SPEAKER_03]: At least it's on my chair this time.

2501
02:59:41,806 --> 02:59:43,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Please don't make me sing anymore.

2502
02:59:43,608 --> 02:59:46,310
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't... We have an afterbirth coming up.

2503
02:59:47,010 --> 02:59:47,551
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just kidding.

2504
02:59:47,611 --> 02:59:47,931
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kidding.

2505
02:59:47,951 --> 02:59:48,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

2506
02:59:48,591 --> 02:59:49,152
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

2507
02:59:49,332 --> 02:59:49,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

2508
02:59:50,032 --> 02:59:53,435
[SPEAKER_03]: If they want to be tortured like that, they're masochists in the goddamn chat room.

2509
02:59:53,475 --> 02:59:53,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

2510
02:59:53,855 --> 02:59:55,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2511
02:59:55,617 --> 02:59:56,017
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

2512
02:59:56,698 --> 02:59:57,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2513
02:59:58,329 --> 02:59:59,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that your final thought?

2514
02:59:59,651 --> 03:00:00,512
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm done, yeah.

2515
03:00:00,793 --> 03:00:05,139
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is, wow, I almost peed when Loki sang.

2516
03:00:05,179 --> 03:00:06,240
[SPEAKER_08]: That was amazing.

2517
03:00:06,621 --> 03:00:10,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki has driven me to urinary movements in my body.

2518
03:00:10,526 --> 03:00:11,207
[SPEAKER_08]: That is amazing.

2519
03:00:13,681 --> 03:00:14,742
[SPEAKER_08]: The final word of tonight.

2520
03:00:15,062 --> 03:00:15,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys for being here.

2521
03:00:15,863 --> 03:00:21,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Next week on the show, season four premiere, Jamie's back in his house and will tell us all about our Alabama trip.

2522
03:00:22,088 --> 03:00:29,715
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR Ultramix is out on the shelves and we'll be giving our impressions if we get a chance to play it, actually, and more craziness.

2523
03:00:30,475 --> 03:00:34,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight's final word I will give to Pixie Dust.

2524
03:00:34,559 --> 03:00:39,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Gets the final word, the one word to sum up the entire show and leave us on.

2525
03:00:43,942 --> 03:00:44,402
[SPEAKER_08]: One man, one way.

2526
03:00:44,422 --> 03:00:44,762
[SPEAKER_08]: One desire.

2527
03:01:14,384 --> 03:01:15,685
[SPEAKER_22]: They went too far.

2528
03:01:16,005 --> 03:01:17,746
[SPEAKER_22]: They broke all the rules.

2529
03:01:18,087 --> 03:01:20,608
[SPEAKER_22]: One man curled the frog as a pimp.

2530
03:01:20,648 --> 03:01:21,629
[SPEAKER_22]: Where's my money?

2531
03:01:23,450 --> 03:01:23,930
[SPEAKER_22]: Where is it?

2532
03:01:26,872 --> 03:01:27,433
[SPEAKER_22]: One man.

2533
03:01:29,094 --> 03:01:29,654
[SPEAKER_22]: One way.

2534
03:01:31,876 --> 03:01:32,756
[SPEAKER_26]: What a weird voice.

2535
03:01:32,796 --> 03:01:35,158
[SPEAKER_26]: That's the only thing that guy could do for a living, you know?

2536
03:01:35,738 --> 03:01:37,199
[SPEAKER_26]: He couldn't be a mechanic or anything.

2537
03:01:38,020 --> 03:01:39,981
[SPEAKER_26]: Hey, how much is that transmission going to cost me?

2538
03:01:41,262 --> 03:01:42,703
[SPEAKER_22]: An arm and a leg.

2539
03:01:42,723 --> 03:01:42,903
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2540
03:01:47,714 --> 03:01:50,257
[SPEAKER_22]: Just imagine having sex with somebody, that'd be hilarious, you know?

2541
03:01:50,417 --> 03:01:52,740
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh yeah, the desire in your eyes.

2542
03:01:54,702 --> 03:01:57,906
[SPEAKER_22]: The passion between us burns with fire.

2543
03:01:58,667 --> 03:02:01,130
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh yeah, one way in, no way out.

2544
03:02:09,600 --> 03:02:10,561
[SPEAKER_22]: Same babble.

2545
03:02:11,222 --> 03:02:13,183
[SPEAKER_22]: Jean-Claude Van Damme.

2546
03:02:13,724 --> 03:02:18,588
[SPEAKER_22]: In the same crap you've seen over and over and over again.

2547
03:02:18,608 --> 03:02:23,572
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd love to be in one of those movies.

2548
03:02:24,253 --> 03:02:32,460
[SPEAKER_22]: Be like... Crescent Heights was a peaceful community until Amy Anderson moved in.

2549
03:02:33,761 --> 03:02:34,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello?

2550
03:02:37,060 --> 03:02:39,181
[SPEAKER_22]: She went to the police, but they couldn't help.

2551
03:02:39,241 --> 03:02:40,622
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry, hasn't done nothing wrong.

2552
03:02:40,682 --> 03:02:43,504
[SPEAKER_22]: So she went to Detective Pablo Francisco.

2553
03:02:44,124 --> 03:02:44,805
[SPEAKER_26]: What's going on?

2554
03:02:45,005 --> 03:02:46,526
[SPEAKER_26]: He's trying to kill me, Pablo!

2555
03:02:46,586 --> 03:02:47,587
[SPEAKER_22]: Double the action.

2556
03:02:48,867 --> 03:02:50,028
[SPEAKER_22]: Triple the excitement.

2557
03:02:50,108 --> 03:02:50,909
[SPEAKER_22]: Get down!

2558
03:02:51,349 --> 03:02:52,610
[SPEAKER_22]: More of the excitement.

2559
03:02:52,870 --> 03:02:53,931
[SPEAKER_22]: Get down again!

2560
03:02:56,332 --> 03:02:59,054
[SPEAKER_22]: With the help of his Mexican girlfriend, Rosa.

2561
03:02:59,094 --> 03:03:01,235
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry, Amy, we'll kick his ass, eh?

2562
03:03:04,697 --> 03:03:05,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Call him late at night.

2563
03:03:09,323 --> 03:03:11,065
[SPEAKER_26]: He always can take something stupid and make it cool.

2564
03:03:11,525 --> 03:03:12,286
[SPEAKER_26]: Can't he?

2565
03:03:12,306 --> 03:03:18,853
[SPEAKER_22]: He'll always be like... In the city, he must fight to survive.

2566
03:03:19,775 --> 03:03:21,757
[SPEAKER_22]: He sold tortillas on the corner.

2567
03:03:23,719 --> 03:03:25,201
[SPEAKER_22]: And the mob wanted in.

2568
03:03:25,821 --> 03:03:28,204
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know who this guy is, but I want him in his tamales.

2569
03:03:28,224 --> 03:03:28,805
[SPEAKER_26]: He's dead!

2570
03:03:30,203 --> 03:03:35,824
[SPEAKER_22]: He had one chance, and his chance was to fight back Arnold Schwarzenegger.

2571
03:03:36,305 --> 03:03:39,445
[SPEAKER_23]: Listen to me, these are my tortillas and I'm not going to give them out.

2572
03:03:41,586 --> 03:03:42,466
[SPEAKER_23]: Listen to me!

2573
03:03:45,687 --> 03:03:47,867
[SPEAKER_22]: In a place where they didn't know his name.

2574
03:03:48,468 --> 03:03:50,408
[SPEAKER_00]: Mijito, who are those men who came here?

2575
03:03:50,428 --> 03:03:51,188
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening?

2576
03:03:51,468 --> 03:03:53,749
[SPEAKER_23]: Listen to me, listen to me, keep your head down.

2577
03:03:53,769 --> 03:03:58,130
[SPEAKER_23]: They're trying to take my tortillas!

2578
03:04:10,200 --> 03:04:14,561
[SPEAKER_22]: Little Tortilla Boy Thank you very much.

2579
03:04:14,661 --> 03:04:15,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Good night.

2580
03:04:15,382 --> 03:04:16,362
[SPEAKER_04]: God bless you.

2581
03:04:17,102 --> 03:04:18,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Good night.

2582
03:04:23,524 --> 03:04:25,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for listening and we'll see you next week.
