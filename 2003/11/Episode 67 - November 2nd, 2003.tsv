850591	853671	It's a good place to listen to the music.
857372	863594	Hello, everybody, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 67, now in progress.
863974	864114	So...
865839	870601	Jamie, tell me about... I'm going to go sit in the living room so I can show up on cam, because otherwise the cam's very boring.
872541	884045	If you want to... If you want to join us on cam, head on over to our chatroom, www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on chat.
884165	888026	And in the chatroom, by the way, chatroom is up on the television screen, so we can all see what you're saying.
889067	890027	I'm going to molest them.
890107	891628	It's interactive when you're in our chatroom.
893317	899598	Jamie, but first tell us, I want everybody to know about these games that you brought to the show tonight, because they're pretty cool.
902339	903759	I had to molest the chat room, sorry.
903859	904279	That's alright.
905139	907939	Well, I'll put them up on, the cam's updating, right?
907959	909740	Yeah, once in a while.
910620	913320	Well, you have to explain for those that aren't going to be on the cam.
913340	915281	I am an old school gaming freak.
915901	916661	I love old games.
917461	918401	Nothing wrong with that.
918621	922302	When Dan and I discovered that Sega was kind enough to...
923257	926380	Release updated versions of their older games.
926460	928161	We hopped right on it and grabbed our three favorites.
928602	928842	Right on.
928862	932305	Of course, one of them was backordered, so we're still waiting for a Phantasy Star collection.
932465	933426	No surprise there.
933486	935568	Well, actually, this is a remake of the first Phantasy Star.
936028	938911	If anyone ever played it on the Master System, you know what I'm talking about.
939211	939391	Right.
940232	945516	But they put out another two games that are probably about my second and third favorite game ever.
945917	947058	And what will be the first game ever?
947739	948440	Guardian Legend.
949000	951742	I seriously doubt that's ever going to get a release.
951782	958427	But the first one I'm putting up on cam right now is probably my other favorite game like ever.
958667	959868	And for those that can't see the cam.
961169	963411	I'm trying to get to where it'll adjust.
964011	965012	It's Fantasy Zone.
966513	968474	The game that brought us the Opa Opa.
969715	971697	Which is this cute little ship with angel wings.
971737	972317	With feet.
972618	974379	And when you're on the gun he has little legs.
975223	976423	and he's super cute.
976743	979524	See, there it is on the camera, Fantasy Zone.
979884	984865	And then the other awesome game... It's funny because the way you held it up, you still have Loki on part of the picture.
987186	988046	I didn't get it up there.
988126	990807	You have a very blurry picture of Space Harrier up there now.
991467	991927	Let me see.
991987	993007	This may be a little bit better.
993247	993547	Okay.
994227	995888	So Space Harrier being the other game, which is...
996468	1003433	For those that may not recognize Space Harrier by name, because I didn't at first, I kind of had to get visuals of these games.
1003453	1004594	So let me kind of describe them for you.
1004654	1008377	Fantasy Zone is like this beautiful... It's sort of like Defender.
1008477	1011339	It's like Defender, but in beautiful, beautiful pastels.
1011740	1013121	And I never thought I'd... It's like happy music.
1013261	1018284	I never thought I'd refer to pastels as a beautiful thing, but Fantasy Zone really pulls it off.
1018345	1020206	It's like uber cute in the way it's painted.
1020246	1021487	It looks like a color by number.
1021727	1031272	And when you're watching, when you're looking at, you know, dead on, it looks like it's fully 2D, but they're really actually flat, self-shaded polygons.
1031592	1044039	That's kind of the point I wanted to get to about these re-releases, is that they didn't just... Now, it's not like a Namco Museum game or an Atari Museum game where they just took the old games, put them on a CD, and emulated them, basically.
1044479	1044679	No.
1044959	1046060	They took these games...
1046580	1046921	DarkSakura,
1062501	1068189	I wasn't like huge fans of them like Jamie was when they were first out, but I remember playing Fantasy Zone.
1068209	1069150	I ran it at one weekend.
1069250	1077201	I played it on the Nintendo where it looked like barf because the color palette isn't the same as it is on a Sega, so it looks all messed up.
1079444	1090532	And the reason why is that the Nintendo was not set up for pastel color, where the Master System was.
1091393	1096897	So I played them and they looked like barf, but coming back now and playing them again, I'm just like, oh my god, this is so beautiful.
1096997	1102221	Finally, we're using a next generation system to make our 2D games look even better.
1102721	1103682	It's so cool.
1104322	1109586	Dear 8-bit companies like Nintendo, anybody that was big in the 8-bit days, even Konami.
1111067	1115711	It would be nice to have Super Konami World Collection 3D.
1116231	1118853	Seriously, I want you all to take up this project.
1119750	1124053	Do your old 2D games in 3D like this, because they are so cool.
1124533	1125994	It's just, oh man.
1126374	1132118	Especially when you're going to release one of these old, kind of like old school game packs, and re-release it as like a new thing.
1132558	1134379	I just, oh, it's so beautiful.
1134979	1135660	Words can't express.
1136100	1138642	They also come with another little neat thing.
1139002	1144505	If you bought the special edition of Phantasy Star, which we actually didn't get, it came with a little binder.
1145406	1148608	And in the binder, you would put these cards in.
1149688	1150168	Oh, okay.
1150469	1154551	That are basically just description of the game, some of the history of it.
1154711	1158113	I'm putting the Winter Fantasy Zone up on the cam.
1158133	1159193	That's still kind of neat, though.
1161234	1165677	So... But they're also, they're bringing out more games.
1165717	1176243	The ones that are out right now in the series is there was, of course, Fantasy Star, Space Harrier, Fantasy Zone, Monaco GP...
1177784	1181626	Goldnax is pretty.
1183786	1194510	There's a site, actually if you go to the live journal community Girl Gamers and just look for my post, I put a big post there about it with a link to the Japanese site
1195313	1200455	where you can watch a streaming video of screens from the first five releases.
1200715	1203876	I'm thinking you need to make that a cross post to the Orange Lounge community.
1204496	1206297	I'll go look for my own post.
1206337	1206737	Good idea.
1207397	1219541	But the next ones that are coming out, and actually I didn't find this out until I looked for the pre-orders on Lixing, but the next one out is Columns.
1220858	1222899	and then the other one, I don't remember what it is.
1222959	1224419	It's a game that didn't come out over here.
1225800	1227760	I'll have to check out.
1227860	1228501	Oh my God.
1228941	1230661	Please tell me they're going to do Alex Kidd.
1231121	1231982	Wouldn't it be nice?
1234622	1236703	Yeah, Alex Kidd was a Sega game, wasn't it?
1236823	1238304	Yes, it was.
1238964	1241345	What would be really cool is if... And Shinobi?
1241905	1243765	Well, they did Shinobi.
1244486	1247186	Yeah, but okay, I'm not counting the new Shinobi.
1247206	1248867	You know what actually I think would be cool?
1248887	1248967	What?
1254671	1256012	and Michael Jackson Moonwalker.
1256232	1256653	Oh yeah.
1257393	1257614	What?
1257754	1257974	What?
1258649	1260731	Skywalker was kind of 3D to begin with.
1260791	1265614	It was one of those cheap, it was still a 2D game, but it was 3D.
1266034	1269417	It was like the Ninja Turtles where you can move up and down, but you know what?
1269477	1270418	Well, this is what I was thinking.
1270438	1273039	You know how in Sonic Adventure 2, how they had the bonus?
1273760	1278243	That was the remake of the Green Hill Zone from the first Sonic game.
1279104	1283147	Wouldn't it be cool if they took the original Sonic games and did them like that?
1285179	1285819	Absolutely.
1286300	1301846	And then, of course, this was just kind of brought up, I think this was brought up in the chat room, I think this is where I saw it, but my very favorite old school Sega game of all time, they badly need to do this port to, Altered Beast.
1302266	1303987	Rise from your grave.
1305327	1308229	I cannot wait for them to do Altered Beast like this.
1308669	1308969	This is...
1310072	1325061	Man, I'm just picturing, I'm kind of picturing, I'm going back to Castlevania, because for those who were listening to Vanilla Sky on Monday, we were talking about the new Castlevania, and kind of got into a discussion on like, you know, is Castlevania good, or what have you, because of the 3D-ness of it now.
1326002	1326822	I'm just thinking, oh my god.
1326842	1331025	And why would she play it in Japanese without the shitty US voice acting?
1331685	1333026	Oh my god, that's so much crap.
1333863	1339951	But I just go back and think, oh my god, what if Simon's Quest were done like this Fantasy Zone thing is?
1340411	1341353	I would have an orgasm.
1343045	1345567	Sega has always been really smart with their games.
1345607	1354131	They've just had, you know, bad advertising and, you know, going up against basically a major monopoly like, you know, Sony is.
1354572	1364838	You know, they say that they didn't have, you know, take from their other facilities, but you can tell they put major money behind the PlayStation, even though the Saturn to this day is still a better system.
1366018	1369940	The Dreamcast to this day has still had better games than many PS2s.
1369960	1372422	You will go to your grave, a Sega fangirl.
1373263	1374945	You know, I used to be a Nintendo fangirl, 100%.
1376506	1380871	And now, my whole support of Nintendo comes just because Sega's supporting them.
1382012	1389119	Isn't it so weird now to fire up a game like F-Zero and you see on the first screen, Sega Nintendo?
1389480	1395586	It's like, wow, ten years ago, you're picturing those ads in your mind, Sega does what Nintendo don't.
1395606	1396487	Well, you know what?
1397428	1405251	I remember on one of my tapes, one of my old tapes off Japanese TV, watching the monkeys, these two little monkeys playing TV.
1405951	1411913	And one of them was playing a Saturn, playing Burning Rangers on the Saturn, if this dates this for you.
1412373	1418075	And the other one was playing like some other game on, like an older crappy game on the PlayStation.
1418615	1420576	And the PlayStation monkey went to go play the Saturn.
1421565	1423546	I have to address something that came up in the chat room.
1423586	1426228	We have some new chatters tonight, so hello to all our new folks.
1426288	1427849	We love seeing some new faces in our chat room.
1428189	1435454	We have a guy named Bargle who says, is a little bit disgusted by the thought of me having an orgasm over a game.
1435834	1436394	You know what?
1436735	1438816	There is nothing better than an orgasm.
1438856	1442018	You name me one thing in this world that's better than an orgasm.
1442198	1442999	Two orgasms.
1443459	1444520	Two orgasms.
1444580	1445480	Thank you, Loki.
1445800	1445980	What?
1447201	1448022	Really good ice cream.
1450501	1459765	Maybe if you're a woman, but... If I was sitting between the best orgasm ever and a bowl of chocolate decadence blue belt ice cream.
1460165	1461286	Chocolate orgasm.
1462406	1462686	Ooh.
1467208	1468569	Although, and this may be TMI.
1468589	1470950	Did I give that a cold stone?
1471030	1475892	The best, actually the best, best thing ever is the bowl of ice cream you eat after an orgasm.
1478133	1478873	Is to go out
1479594	1480194	Fuck a bunch.
1481775	1482996	And then eat a bowl of ice cream.
1483377	1485038	For some, it's the cigarettes.
1485118	1486358	For some, it's the ice cream.
1486418	1487979	Hey, I don't smoke.
1488380	1496405	Next time I'm going to go into Cold Stone, I'm going to be all, yeah, could I get the, I'd like to get the vanilla cream with the orgasm mix in.
1499647	1507092	You know, we need to sit and create, call it the Orange Lounge Orgasm at Cold Stone.
1508858	1511400	and keep and like put the right number in it.
1511480	1512380	Oh, like write it in and stuff?
1512400	1513481	Well, they don't have those anymore.
1513521	1513841	What?
1514582	1516082	I was going to put mine in.
1517882	1522644	I used to have my cherry cheesecake flavor that I just called the DarkSakura.
1523764	1524285	How original.
1524305	1535069	Because it was, you know, it was graham cracker, brownie, cheesecake, and cherry pie filling.
1536210	1538631	It was so good and so bad for me.
1539151	1541292	I want ice cream now.
1541312	1544033	As good as that sounds, Jamie, orgasms are better.
1547441	1551304	Anyway... Ice cream after... I think we got off on a little bit of a tangent there.
1551324	1551844	Sorry, kids.
1552044	1552325	Hey!
1552425	1553425	That's what we do here on Orange Honor.
1553445	1554506	Welcome to the Fantasy Zone.
1554606	1554946	Get ready.
1556267	1558309	So, um... I was so happy because it's in there!
1558409	1559730	Does it actually have voice acting?
1559990	1560630	Well, yeah.
1560811	1562392	It's like... Okay, this is what happened.
1562752	1564913	I wish we could play it for the chat room, but we really can't.
1565474	1572499	Um, but, um... When you're, um... It's like, when you start off the game, it doesn't say the Welcome to the Fantasy Zone, get ready.
1573019	1574180	At least the first time it did it.
1574740	1576822	It's like... Like...
1577572	1579594	Get Ready, Harrier, or something like that.
1579614	1580134	I bet you were pissed.
1580214	1581035	And then go for it.
1581095	1582396	I bet you were pissed when you heard that.
1582476	1582976	Oh, I was.
1583036	1588940	And then, like, four games later, you know, watching Dan play it the other night, it finally said it.
1589100	1590642	And we were like, ah.
1591362	1595965	I remember when I first ever, like, saw your post back on DDR Freak.
1596066	1598788	I remember that was your signature, welcome to the Fantasy Zone, get ready.
1599168	1601950	And I always thought it was actually from Fantasy Zone.
1602330	1608934	Well, the thing is that Space Harrier is set in the same universe as Fantasy Zone.
1610695	1612116	I think a lot of people don't realize that.
1612236	1613997	I know you've mentioned that to me before.
1614537	1618800	If you look at the original games, Fantasy Zone has the big plaid floors and everything.
1619300	1624383	And then you have the checkered ground, and then the checkered ground is in Space Harrier, the originals.
1625824	1641013	and it's set in the same universe although they made it completely different for these two they look completely different so here's my final thought on the whole 8-bit games being redone Guardian Legend Remake Guardian Legend Remake Dear Broderbund and who else put that game out?
1641273	1654200	I don't remember Broderbund was the publisher of it please do a Guardian Legend Remake oh my god I would never leave the house ever it's done it would be more addicting you know there was there was a game that came out
1655325	1656545	Guardian Legend Online.
1656785	1657726	Oh, my God.
1657906	1658726	No, I don't know.
1658786	1660567	Guardian Legend is not a game to be played online.
1660607	1662647	Guardian Legend is a masturbatory game.
1662707	1664027	It's a solo experience.
1665748	1666388	You know what?
1666448	1667629	They need to freaking do it.
1667689	1668709	It's a solo orgasm.
1668909	1670389	You know what?
1670589	1672670	It was the original survival horror game.
1674343	1675885	I don't know if I'd call it a horror game
1705020	1707120	But you have to go find weapons, you know.
1707540	1710501	I mean, she was doing it before Snake ever did his thing.
1710521	1711481	It's the same thing, too.
1712121	1715562	It's tactical survival espionage horror shooting game.
1716042	1732505	I always, I don't know if I'd go as far to say that it was this new genre of game that was fabulous, but what it did is it took two genres of existing games, like Zelda and Gradius, to kind of name two, more like Life Force, maybe, but took these two games and brought them together.
1732525	1733425	It was about as hard as Life Force.
1734205	1735546	So beautifully.
1736307	1740911	It's just like going to a wedding and crying at the beautiful union of these two things.
1741231	1743373	And it had the little thingies from Adventure of Lolo.
1744514	1744734	What?
1744875	1746316	The blue thingies from Adventure of Lolo.
1748432	1748792	It did.
1749252	1749733	They've had the shots.
1749753	1757556	I don't think they were, I think they were supposed to be, they're related to the blue things from Zexys.
1758016	1760617	Z-E-Y-X-Z, that game, Zexys?
1761217	1761457	Yeah.
1761777	1764018	I think it's related to those blue guys, not the Lolo guy.
1764038	1765519	I think Lolo's a different blue guy.
1766439	1769140	So I was like, hey, the guys from Adventure Lolo left.
1769300	1770020	They're boycotting.
1771721	1774182	It was, and you know, it had really good music in it, too.
1775220	1780363	And I also knew the trick where you could walk through the divider walls in the center.
1780723	1786187	It's like if you held your controller at an angle, you could walk through the wall and get to the other side.
1786207	1789529	8-bit games are great.
1789809	1792651	And you know the other neat controller trick was the one for Mega Man 3?
1794212	1798414	I submitted the thing to Nintendo Power way back when.
1798854	1801816	Because I was the first person I knew of that found this little trick.
1802837	1804538	You know, everyone knew about the double jump.
1805200	1810945	In Mega Man 3, where you hold down your left and right and A button or something like that on the second controller.
1811866	1814068	Because I would put it on the floor and sit in a chair and hold it with my feet.
1815249	1821894	But if you fall down a hole and then you let go and then hit it again, you'll hear the die noise and then you can jump out of the hole.
1822555	1823415	And you have no life.
1823856	1824216	Really?
1825497	1829901	And you can use, the only way that you can shoot anything is to use your special weapons.
1831202	1833344	Because your shot is also your life.
1834199	1838800	But if you hit a power up, you know, a life refill, then you have to do the trick again.
1839160	1846202	But it's really convenient when you're going against a boss and they can't kill you because you're already dead.
1848462	1852203	So, that's, you know, I'm going off on a tangent right now.
1852363	1853344	Hooray for digression.
1854184	1854644	That's all right.
1855430	1856831	Alright, we need a topic change.
1856851	1859954	So you're going to be gone the next two weeks.
1860935	1861496	So what's going on?
1862036	1865640	For those that are just joining us tonight, because I know we have some new folks, what's going on?
1865660	1866941	Why are you going to be leaving us the next couple of weeks?
1867121	1868202	I'm going to see my family.
1868263	1869684	The fifth is my mama's birthday.
1871265	1876851	I'm very pissed off that this is going to go into the fuckies of the week because I can't buy my mom her Alan Jackson tickets because I can't afford them.
1877552	1877752	Awe.
1878312	1883498	Which I'm really not, you know, that upset about me missing Alan Jackson, but mom is really... Right.
1884418	1888663	And unless the credit card I signed up for arrives, I can't get her tickets.
1889824	1890224	Poopy.
1892306	1894128	So, you know, I'm going to take her out to eat.
1894168	1895389	I'm going to try to do something nice.
1896370	1908600	Um, but the general itinerary is spending time with my family, spending time with my mama-san and papa-san, who were really, really good friends of mine who took care of me when I needed some place to stay.
1908620	1915386	Um, going to my college and getting my transcripts, because, you know, technically I'm still enrolled at the University of South Alabama.
1915586	1918168	I technically, I'm still enrolled at a school in California, too.
1918529	1920010	Um, um,
1921903	1926068	Get a, have to get a SARS mask to go visit my mom's house because she and her husband both smoke.
1927350	1928331	And also have a dog.
1929372	1930754	What am I super allergic to?
1931294	1932876	Cigar smoking dog.
1933537	1936821	Didn't you, um, oh, I don't, um.
1937162	1938543	I smoked a while back.
1938583	1939264	Well, yeah, but.
1939304	1941407	But it was the cigars because I wasn't allergic to them.
1942904	1944085	But I think it's different.
1944205	1948289	Once you quit, like, it can... That was really stupid of me because I had asthma.
1948550	1949771	It can really affect you.
1950171	1957018	Honestly, and I know that probably some people who are listening smoke, I know that some people do every so often.
1958500	1962484	But I still think that's probably the most retarded thing anyone can do to themselves.
1962984	1964506	That, and it's also pretty...
1965346	1967288	and forgive me for saying so, this is how I feel about it.
1967588	1970390	It's also pretty inconsiderate of other people because you're poisoning their air.
1971490	1972151	If you think about it.
1972491	1973692	They have to breathe the smoke.
1975273	1975953	But that's another story.
1976394	1979716	And oh my god, I went to the casino and I thought I was going to die.
1980636	1981497	You went to the casino?
1981517	1986340	I went to Thunder Valley yesterday with Iguanago and Islander.
1987281	1988602	You know what's weird about that casino?
1988622	1988702	What?
1989902	1990603	No arcade.
1991624	1992525	I'm such a dork.
1993205	1998510	The first time the casino opened up, I'm like, ooh, maybe there'll be a cool DDR machine because that's just what an addict I am.
1999210	2001312	And no arcade to be found anywhere.
2001352	2005455	Where do the kids go when mommy and daddy go to gamble, which I know happens a lot.
2005696	2007597	I think that they lock them in the trunk.
2009319	2011981	But the whole reason we went was to play bingo.
2014013	2014814	They have bingo there?
2014854	2015414	They have bingo.
2015454	2015994	It's pretty fun.
2016074	2017195	When?
2017335	2021137	They do it once an hour, and it's basically like 45, 50 minutes of bingo.
2022218	2022938	Holy shit.
2023839	2025880	You can do the electronic or you can do the paper play.
2025900	2028442	In the paper play, you basically get twice as many cards.
2028862	2030863	Is there a separate room for bingo or something?
2030983	2033385	A big banquet, like a convention room.
2033465	2035546	I have never seen the bingo room.
2035886	2037487	It says bingo in big old letters inside.
2037507	2043411	Like when you go in the door and head off to the right and around past the snack area, there's the bingo room.
2044211	2051078	But it's $12 for the paper play and the lightning progressive round and the validation.
2051679	2054642	But it's pretty fun, and, you know, I was really close to a blackout.
2054782	2055983	I mean, I was, like, three away.
2056543	2056804	Right.
2057004	2059967	So... Did anybody win anything?
2060087	2060787	Did one of you get three?
2060988	2061768	No, we didn't win.
2061788	2062189	Oh, bummer.
2062309	2062789	But I...
2065478	2069739	We went back to play on the slot machines, trying to earn money for the next game.
2070619	2074820	And I just randomly sat down in front of a machine, put a dollar in it, and got $15.50 back.
2075260	2075640	Cool.
2075920	2079461	It's one of those, you know, where you can play up to 15 lines or 9 lines or something.
2079481	2079621	Right.
2080421	2090083	And I got, I only played one line, get this, I played one line, the middle line, and it was the one that's all like the poker faces.
2090423	2090663	Right.
2090883	2091623	Like 10 and up.
2092164	2093844	And I got all 10s across.
2095690	2099031	I actually won like 17 off of it that I played a couple more rounds.
2099172	2106234	My future strategy for casinos, I've learned from LankyStyle, one of the folks you hear on Vanilla Sky, video poker is where it's at.
2106334	2111316	Honestly, when I was in Reno last time, the only place I made money was video poker, and that is all I'm ever going to play.
2111336	2112517	I lost all my video poker skills.
2112577	2113457	I don't know what happened.
2113477	2114818	That is all I'm ever going to play in the future.
2114838	2119999	When I was in Vegas for the ZDF Week moderatorship, I was at the end of my money when we were leaving.
2120560	2120980	I had...
2121881	2122741	50 cents in my pocket.
2123642	2124903	And I turned it into $10.
2126485	2127546	Because I needed a cap there.
2128587	2132070	I'm looking at the chat room, some of the comments on bingo.
2132111	2135073	We have some folks that say they hate bingo.
2135434	2137476	You get complimentary prune juice.
2137576	2141099	My grandma plays bingo with shuffleboard.
2141400	2142901	Was it a lot of old people there playing bingo?
2142921	2144783	There were old people there, but there were a lot of young people too.
2145263	2146184	You know what?
2146644	2157674	I'm noticing bingo seems to be like a younger and younger thing because we had a girl in one of my classes where I work and we asked everybody, you know, why are you hired at work and da-da-da, why did you decide to, you know, come to this place and work?
2158074	2160896	And one of the girls actually said, I have to fund my bingo addiction.
2162198	2165140	And she, get this, she had a daughter in her purse.
2165560	2168343	Not like a son and daughter, but like a bingo daughter.
2168443	2168863	A dauber.
2169063	2170565	Maybe not a daughter, a dauber.
2170905	2173087	She had a dauber in her purse with her, always.
2173912	2175594	You think we're obsessed on this show.
2175674	2184262	Well, the thing is that they actually have, you know, they've got sight machines, but they also have, like, soda fountain machines and coffee and tea.
2185163	2187745	And I made a latte there for myself.
2188326	2191429	I freaking played bingo and had a latte with whipped cream.
2191569	2193050	Well, they have a Starbucks in the casino.
2193331	2194472	You know what they have in the casino?
2194732	2195353	A fat burger.
2196113	2196814	I can't either.
2197234	2197835	I know, but it's...
2198480	2201061	Although I did hear they have turkey burgers, so I'll have to go there for a turkey burger.
2201881	2203302	Oh my god, I ate a pork cutlet.
2204582	2205482	It made me sick, too.
2205662	2206983	Did you go to the buffet there?
2207263	2209704	No, I ate it at my friend's house.
2210064	2211904	We wanted to go to Fresh Choice.
2212205	2217686	When you come back from Alabama, we'll go play bingo, and we'll go late so we can go to the buffet, because the buffet is so good.
2217966	2224268	The thing is, we played the 5-7 game, and the thing is that you don't get a second chance on the 5-7 game.
2226769	2229750	So we need to go play the earlier games if we're going to go.
2229950	2230430	Interesting.
2230470	2232531	So you can get a second chance to win because I was close.
2234352	2235572	Is it going 24 hours a day?
2237272	2237853	No, I don't think so.
2237973	2238933	Oh, well, shit.
2239353	2244155	The buffet is like... I know this is really interesting to all our listeners out of town, but just bear with us.
2244995	2249916	The buffet is only like $6 after 11 o'clock at night.
2250256	2250817	Holy crap.
2250877	2251437	Well, we should go.
2251557	2252337	You have to go late.
2252637	2253938	But man, if you don't eat all day...
2256457	2258959	and then go... What's it like during the day?
2260080	2260400	Pricey?
2261141	2261721	Like 15 bucks.
2261741	2263042	That's still not bad.
2263282	2265324	Not bad, but... Not for like a casino buffet.
2265344	2267465	Considering everything you get, not bad.
2267565	2274871	The one I went to at the... I want to say the Beaurevage, but that's one in Biloxi where my friend works.
2275552	2279194	But it was the Rio Casino.
2280155	2281436	They have a seafood buffet.
2281476	2282537	It was like 30 bucks.
2283337	2283958	But you get like
2284954	2294959	Main Lobster on the buffet, you know, that was like king crab, Alaskan snow crab and everything.
2294999	2295959	I was like, ha ha, fish.
2297080	2297420	Okay.
2297460	2299341	But that's, 15's not bad compared.
2299781	2300862	Well, we'll have to go and eat back.
2301162	2302142	But have fun in Alabama.
2302343	2304804	I don't know what we're going to do on the show without you while you're gone.
2305644	2305884	Well.
2305904	2310286	Because Loki and I, the last time we did a show by ourselves, it was very interesting.
2310306	2311047	Yeah.
2311980	2314261	Yeah, that was the first time Loki made super bacon on the air.
2314621	2315021	God.
2315882	2318923	I'm hoping we have a temporary fill-in somehow.
2319744	2320364	We'll get somebody.
2320384	2322745	I have to find my temporary fill-in.
2322765	2326046	We need to find a woman, because we need the female perspective on the show.
2326246	2326827	You know what?
2326847	2331209	We need to get... Yeah, we need to make Melody come down.
2331269	2332229	No, we'll figure something out.
2332349	2333890	We need to get Pixie, too.
2336463	2337684	I haven't yet to meet her.
2338145	2339666	I've heard good things about her, but I haven't met her.
2339906	2342329	Oh, Pixie Dust.
2342529	2344191	I'm thinking of the other Pixie.
2344211	2344851	There's two Pixies.
2346133	2348375	And then I'll have to, like, call.
2349679	2350019	You know what?
2350440	2352281	We'll just get all the women here in your absence.
2352341	2357946	We'll get Irene and Melody and Janae and ViolentHyperGirl.
2357966	2359468	We'll just get them all here one night.
2359948	2362770	We'll have a girls' night on Orange Lounge.
2363251	2363911	That's it.
2366974	2370377	And I'll just be sitting in the corner making fun of everyone else.
2374281	2374681	We'll see.
2376556	2376956	We'll see.
2378557	2382780	Well, so who knows what's going to happen when you're gone, but we'll still be doing shows.
2383080	2383981	You're going to miss Episode 69.
2384581	2385422	I cry.
2386002	2386643	That's okay.
2387163	2390125	But some more announcements about what's coming up to the stations.
2390145	2391546	Some big changes coming in November.
2391746	2392647	All through the month, really.
2393687	2395629	So we'll talk about that in a little while.
2395769	2397750	Oh my God, my voice still isn't all the way back.
2398533	2403756	Well, I was just about to go into... I can whine really well, but my voice is messed up.
2403836	2410319	I was just about to go into how was your week, how was your day, so I'll let you continue your bitching by asking you, how was your week, how was your day?
2411199	2412520	I didn't have a voice most of the week.
2413340	2416681	As everyone can tell, it's barely, barely back.
2416702	2416722	I...
2420450	2423392	Felt lots better, you know, progressively throughout the day.
2423432	2425993	The cough is, I guess as everyone can tell, mostly cleared up.
2426433	2428434	Although I still need the codeine at night.
2429315	2430355	I'm on happy drugs.
2430456	2431976	I took the last of my antibiotics today.
2432397	2432737	Whee!
2433937	2438280	Um, I didn't touch my Bimani except to lend it out to people while I'm out of town.
2440381	2442562	And... Shit, I should have gotten my ignition pad back.
2442762	2443042	Oh well.
2443643	2444123	That's alright.
2444223	2446764	He's gonna have the super ones done soon enough.
2447185	2447465	Okay.
2448947	2453108	Yeah, I haven't been able to play DDR while my asthma has been so bad.
2453448	2460810	But I'm going to play it in Alabama, and I'm going to play it if they still have it, the Beatmania 6 Mix Machine, if they still have it in the middle of the mall.
2462071	2463211	I'm looking forward to that.
2466212	2468012	Really, I didn't do a lot, much of anything.
2469172	2470293	Dan and I went out a bunch.
2471513	2474334	On Halloween, my work...
2475956	2478937	Every department decorated for a contest.
2479637	2489020	There's this one group that's in another building at the... I just told Bob where it is.
2489740	2494881	But there's another building back there that they did Studio 100M.
2496002	2497402	So they made it up like a dance club.
2498663	2502425	It was really nice, but one of the rooms upstairs was the super VIP room.
2502905	2509168	And they had baking powder out on a mirror with a laser blade to look like cocaine.
2510449	2510829	Oh, how nice.
2510849	2513170	And everyone was dressed up all 70s and everything.
2513290	2514731	Oh, that's a lovely picture.
2514871	2519333	One of the other places was, they did it up like the Old West.
2519393	2520693	It was really nice the way they did it.
2520753	2522974	It had a bum in the jail and everything.
2523975	2526236	And another one was the Haunted Pirate Ship.
2527285	2528186	and one was the 60s.
2528286	2530447	They did the 60s theme.
2530767	2532208	And you know what they handed out as snacks?
2532908	2533348	Brownies.
2534529	2536090	And this stuff called Bong Water.
2537030	2537490	Oh, how nice.
2537530	2541852	It's a drink that these people are making in Arizona and they're going to be marketing it here now.
2542913	2544774	Like in the next few months or so.
2545394	2546835	And I tried it and it's really good.
2547315	2550917	It's like, not really carbonated, but more like a flavored water beverage.
2551037	2551517	It's really good.
2553511	2556074	And now, customer service was the best.
2556214	2558116	We won best, of course.
2558277	2558657	Did you?
2559158	2561340	We were haven and heck.
2562381	2564784	And I decided that I was going to be in hell.
2565445	2567767	So I wore my evil boots.
2568688	2569830	Where you belong.
2572392	2579939	I wear my evil boots that I wore at Anime Expo from my Mad Hatter costume, the ones that make me, you know, instantly five inches taller.
2581040	2586485	Black pinstripe pants, this, you know, black sort of corporate looking atop.
2587066	2595534	And my black wings, I had, you know, lots of really gothy makeup and carried my whip with me and I was a modern day angel of death.
2596994	2605737	and all the cubicles were lined in black and the walls were black and red and we had a guillotine and we had the Grim Reaper hanging out in the corner.
2606257	2606877	Off with their heads.
2607197	2612199	We had these gates coming into the major walkways and they had fire raising from them.
2612219	2614380	We had little torches, fake fire everywhere.
2615060	2616920	And we had the lights off.
2617220	2617941	Fire's great.
2618061	2620461	So it was all red and fiery and everything.
2620481	2624543	I totally missed Halloween in my work, but I'll get into that later.
2624963	2625363	But, uh,
2626588	2629714	One of the girls at my work, her costume was the best.
2629734	2633280	She did the girl from The Ring, the TV girl.
2633641	2634362	Cool.
2635404	2637247	Keep in mind, I haven't seen The Ring, but I knew...
2638467	2647032	The Ring is, for a contemporary horror movie, it's really, really good.
2647112	2648453	I need to watch Ringu.
2648713	2654936	I have actually heard that some people, even folks that usually prefer Japanese cinema, actually say The Ring is better.
2655076	2655817	But I've heard mixed.
2655917	2660880	Well, I've heard that the Japanese one's more suspense and the American one's more horror.
2661620	2662601	Yeah, I could see that.
2662921	2665022	And I would go for the suspense over the other two.
2666224	2668145	and I watched movie trailers today.
2668625	2668905	Did you?
2669265	2670866	Preview for a movie I have to see.
2671046	2671406	What's that?
2671647	2672667	Alien vs. Predator.
2674048	2674588	Oh, crap.
2674608	2676009	Oh, give me a break.
2676029	2677449	That looks like crap.
2678330	2679110	Really?
2679130	2679310	No.
2679390	2682632	I'm going to see it because I've read some of the comics.
2682932	2685613	Alien vs. Predator needs to stay a video game.
2686579	2689605	Oh, I know it's nothing like the comics, but... I have a question.
2689845	2696338	I have a question that will determine if this... I have a question of all question that will determine if this movie will suck or not.
2696779	2697821	It's Sigourney Weaver in it.
2698889	2699789	Fuck this movie.
2700290	2701450	But I'm still going to see it.
2701770	2706112	I'm still going to see it just because I want to see all the action that ensues.
2706172	2707213	I don't care about the story.
2707633	2710634	I'm there to see predators and aliens beating each other up.
2710874	2713916	This movie ruins the continuity of all the sequels.
2714456	2716317	Seriously, it makes no sense.
2716517	2718258	I don't think it's supposed to.
2718598	2719498	It makes no sense.
2719618	2720539	It's just retarded.
2720599	2724561	I would rather see Freddy vs. Jason ten more times.
2725161	2726762	I'd watch the featurette on it.
2726982	2727482	I'd rather...
2728405	2731647	I'd rather go see The House of the Dead than this movie.
2732307	2735609	The story is utter shit, but I think the action's going to be good.
2736629	2742112	And I want to see the decapitations and shootings and blood and crap.
2742792	2744993	I want to see all... I'm going... I want to see it for the action.
2745013	2745934	Alright, fair enough.
2745954	2747094	So you're in it for the violence.
2747174	2748075	I'm in it for the violence.
2748235	2748775	Alright, fair enough.
2748795	2750556	That for me is going to be a gore bust.
2750576	2753117	Cheesy gore, I can deal with that as a reason.
2753437	2756739	However, let's see Alien vs. Predator vs. Ash.
2757426	2758126	How about it, huh?
2758286	2758687	How about it?
2759147	2760508	I'll just bring out the boomstick.
2763129	2764170	Question from chat room, Jamie.
2764210	2765470	Is the feature ad on the web somewhere?
2766431	2777617	If you go to apple.com slash trailers, it's actually in, I think there's four columns and it's in the second one.
2779217	2779818	Cool.
2780118	2781419	So what other movie trailers did you watch?
2781479	2783320	I watched one for Resident Evil Apocalypse.
2783540	2784120	That was funny.
2784520	2785221	Is that the sequel?
2785621	2785781	Yeah.
2787060	2789903	It's a commercial for this stuff called Regenerate.
2791224	2797270	And this woman, and you can tell it's obviously touched up, a young woman, but she's got it looking all wrinkled and everything.
2797871	2803016	And it looks like, for the people who saw Resident Evil, it looks like the T-Virus.
2804298	2804859	Thank you for watching!
2822191	2823912	Maybe I'll check out the sequel when it's on video.
2824432	2827612	You need to watch the trailer, though, because it is hilarious.
2828133	2836715	I'm sorry, the best movie, you know, game movie adaptions have to be, without a doubt, Street Fighter Double Dragon.
2836775	2839816	They rocked like nothing else.
2840656	2843557	Shut up, shut up, shut up.
2843577	2845177	No, I thought you were going to say Super Mario Brothers.
2845737	2847538	Has there been a really, really good one?
2848538	2848858	Well...
2849682	2850923	Mortal Kombat was decent.
2850943	2851903	Mortal Kombat was good.
2851943	2852824	When I was at that age.
2856226	2861829	You know what I thought was better than... Actually, it's another Van Damme movie that I thought was better than the Street Fighter movie that they did.
2862249	2863690	Because it seemed like it fit more in it.
2863970	2864470	What was it called?
2864510	2865031	The Quest?
2866692	2868653	Yeah, there was a Van Damme movie called The Quest.
2868693	2870654	That made me think of a Street Fighter flick.
2871845	2872826	What Street Fighter should have been.
2872866	2874187	I had that whole impression when I saw it.
2874427	2876709	And I went and saw that one in the theater because it was a dollar movie.
2877430	2882254	The whole reason I was there is because I went there to play one of my favorite games ever, Starblade.
2882934	2889059	Because they had the one with the big crane set up where you played 75 cents and you were in this full 3D motion.
2889820	2890200	Cool.
2890560	2894964	And they told me that I had to see a movie to keep playing the game, so I went and saw that.
2896465	2899868	And then I went to... Because I was like the only person who could...
2902230	2903231	The Last Starfighter.
2905433	2906434	Wasn't that the game?
2906554	2909376	The game came out after the movie.
2909396	2909917	Whatever!
2910397	2911939	It still ties together.
2912699	2913880	The Last Starfighter was a good movie.
2913920	2914321	You lose.
2914501	2915021	Try again.
2915962	2917483	But I know I remember it was a good one.
2918645	2919966	I just can't think of what it was.
2924129	2925150	Let's ask our chatroom.
2925611	2925831	What?
2926972	2927612	What do they think?
2927652	2929234	You know, we need to do a list list tonight.
2930487	2932527	What game needs to be made into a movie?
2934268	2934888	We can do it.
2934968	2935568	Just three of us?
2935888	2936408	Sure, why not?
2937528	2939049	We'll put four things on instead of three.
2939489	2939789	Okay.
2939849	2940189	Fair enough?
2940469	2942729	Okay.
2942829	2944269	Okay, I'm cool with that.
2944289	2945150	We haven't done that ever?
2945950	2946130	No.
2946410	2947330	Well, okay, we'll do that.
2947950	2948910	I thought we had two.
2948930	2957692	Well, I'll ask an Orange Lounge historian such as Dark Tetsuya or Angel that follows the show better than we do if we've done that before.
2957772	2958552	I don't think we have.
2959662	2960763	I don't think that we've done that one.
2962264	2967249	I know we've joked a lot about DDR the movie on this show, but I don't think we ever did that one.
2967269	2968249	What a big hoax.
2968270	2972233	You know, I laugh to this day about the people who thought it was going to happen.
2974155	2979739	I still think, especially after seeing the Parapara manga, which I think came up on Vanilla Sky.
2979759	2982382	I don't think it came up on this show because we didn't find it until Monday.
2983357	2988623	Actually, the Power of Power manga was the exact same story they were going to use for the DDR movie.
2988683	2996492	So, I'm thinking that people bought the story for the DDR movie and go, well, let's just put it with another Romani game.
2996512	2997873	They're never going to know the difference.
3003019	3004300	So, back to your week and your day.
3005424	3008385	I'm still waiting for Battle Royale Volume 3 to be out.
3009245	3013066	And I haven't had a chance to go by Kino Kuniya to pick up the others that I'm missing.
3015426	3020048	Apart from that, I decided that I'm going to start picking up another manga series after I'm done with Battle Royale.
3021208	3024629	And that's Berserk, which is still going and very expensive, but I don't care.
3025289	3026129	And that's really about it.
3027489	3028670	I spent lots of time with my boy.
3030270	3031971	Loki, we haven't heard much from you this show.
3032011	3033611	Hey, chat room, no flooding.
3035208	3037649	Alright, you're getting kicked.
3038009	3038849	Every last one of you.
3040509	3042070	Loki, we haven't heard much from you yet this show.
3042110	3042430	What's up?
3044270	3045471	I've eaten too much rice.
3046431	3047471	Had two bowls of rice.
3047631	3048952	I should have known better than that.
3049732	3052633	But, um... I didn't do anything this week.
3054253	3056854	And, um... Just kinda hung out.
3057514	3058974	Got a costume for Halloween.
3059054	3060675	Wore the costume for Halloween.
3061715	3062495	And, um...
3064736	3068459	I was working on my pads, or not my pads, my cabinet.
3068739	3069379	I was working on it.
3069540	3073222	I was going to finish it, or well, not really finish it, but start actually putting it together today.
3074924	3080808	But then I realized my measurements were off because the plans called for 5 eighths of an inch.
3082429	3083109	Thank you for watching!
3101377	3103718	I don't know, not too much other stuff has been going on.
3103758	3109160	Just been sitting at home and stuff inside because it's cold out.
3109760	3112981	And went down to the golf lane yesterday and that was okay.
3114642	3115582	Stupid people there.
3118343	3119823	I don't know, not much.
3120024	3123905	You'd think I'd be playing Castlevania since I bought it, but no I'm not because I don't care.
3124845	3129547	And thought about playing Zelda today but never actually got to play Zelda today.
3132009	3135134	and... I don't know.
3135555	3137819	Just broke, waiting for more money.
3138720	3139161	That's about it.
3143080	3150964	My week was interesting because I was on vacation this week, and originally my plan was to go to West Hollywood for Halloween, because, you know, I want to be with my people on Halloween.
3152085	3153825	But it didn't end up happening.
3153845	3157027	We decided to cancel the trip, mostly because of the fires that were going on in SoCal.
3157047	3158988	We kind of didn't want to end up in the middle of all of it.
3159048	3165411	My friend has really bad asthma and was afraid that the ash in the air might get to him, contacts as well, things like that.
3166251	3168212	and just some other stuff that came up.
3168232	3169432	So we ended up going on the trip.
3169492	3173134	So I've kind of just been having a lazy vacation.
3173174	3174654	I've just been sitting on my big butt.
3175394	3178836	I literally think I've gained three pounds while on this vacation.
3179016	3182857	And I don't care because I've kind of...
3184157	3185318	Just needed it, I think.
3185338	3187958	Because I've been working really hard non-stop for the past couple months.
3187998	3188999	And it's going to be crazy.
3189039	3191839	This holiday season right up until Christmas is going to be really crazy.
3191879	3193260	I'm just not going to have any time for anything.
3193820	3197821	So I'm kind of glad I got a little vacation before I have to go back.
3197881	3200882	Sometimes a vacation can be taken in your living room.
3201502	3203562	And I played a lot of Final Fantasy XI.
3204022	3205923	I'll talk about Final Fantasy XI a little later in the show.
3207003	3208604	Much to Jamie's dislike.
3208744	3210004	But she'll just have to deal with it.
3210984	3223788	That was pretty much my week and my day.
3224428	3226629	Today, not a whole lot going on.
3226669	3227870	I've just been sleeping in.
3228950	3238233	I tried to get myself back on a regular sleep schedule because I've got to get up early and go back to work tomorrow, so I don't want to be on too crazy of a sleep schedule because I don't want to be an irritable bitch tomorrow.
3239813	3240574	That's pretty much it.
3241134	3244256	Oh, at least you're not going in for the 5.30 shift.
3245097	3250000	No, but I am going in a half hour early tomorrow, which means we're going in at 7, which for me is early, so we'll see.
3250240	3251521	I think we work the same shift.
3252561	3254823	I work 7.30 to 4 usually.
3254843	3255123	Oh, 7.30 to 4.30.
3255203	3257285	We're about the same.
3257545	3258545	I only take a half for lunch.
3259406	3261647	I have something to tell you later, though.
3262368	3262548	Oh.
3262608	3263589	Which might be interesting.
3263649	3264089	Oh, really?
3264549	3264749	Yes.
3265350	3266631	My work is moving in a few months.
3267611	3268352	Oh, to near me?
3268971	3270352	to the area I used to work in.
3270812	3271412	Oh, okay.
3272292	3272872	That's cool.
3273393	3273833	Cool deal.
3275693	3276154	Okay.
3276694	3281716	Well, I think what we're going to do this break is we're going to take another break, actually, right now, and then we're going to come back.
3281736	3284497	And we actually have some Bambani things to talk about, so we'll do that.
3284957	3289118	We have the cage match still, the FUs of the week, of course, all that fun stuff.
3289318	3291199	What do you want to hear next?
3293300	3298924	Okay, we're going to, since we did an attack break last time, I think what we're going to do this time is we'll take a Taka break.
3300044	3300765	Won't that be fun?
3301725	3302546	Yay.
3303206	3307949	So we'll be back, and some Bomani news to talk about, among other things.
3309430	3315634	Join our chat room, www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on Chat.
3316615	3318776	And while I look for the MP3 I want this break...
3320600	3324483	I think that later on during the show, though, we need to do a break of another's.
3326044	3326605	We could do that.
3327606	3332830	Because, you know, I'm really, really, really, sometime today, wanting to hear a leading side for another.
3333470	3334491	We'll see if we can arrange that.
3335292	3337914	All right, we're going to take a break with some talk of music, and we will be back.
3424468	3424753	Thank you.
3496169	3497226	Thanks for watching!
3696005	3697266	Orange Lounge Radio.
3697586	3699747	We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
3700567	3700907	Howdy.
3700927	3701227	We're back.
3701247	3701688	Did you miss us?
3712819	3714681	Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 67.
3714742	3715843	We're in the middle of it right now.
3715863	3719247	Yeah, and it's gooey and sticky.
3719588	3720809	Big station news.
3721090	3722552	Big, big station news.
3722572	3726056	There's a lot of shit coming to the station in November.
3728359	3730482	First off, this Wednesday...
3731298	3736141	is the return of LiveWire, so you better be listening, because we don't want Loki to have another fit.
3737242	3740204	But no, if you're not listening, you're seriously missing out, because it's some good stuff.
3740284	3742105	And if you're not listening, you're a poopy head.
3742125	3751952	That's right, you're missing out on live mixing of Dance Trance and sometimes, sometimes, once in a while, a Bomani song.
3752512	3753853	Is there anything you want to say about Loki?
3754333	3756335	He's too busy thumbing through my Final Fantasy XI manual.
3756455	3756995	No, he says no.
3757856	3759337	Loki, you're being awfully quiet tonight.
3759377	3759977	Is everything okay?
3760117	3760818	Are you feeling alright?
3762420	3763141	Aw, he has a headache.
3763181	3765021	Do you want some Advil?
3766882	3770884	Oh, it's outside.
3770904	3772405	So we have Live Wire returning on Wednesday.
3773045	3778348	This week, by the way, this week and one week only, Vanilla Sky and Pump Up the Volume are changing nights.
3778808	3782090	So Pump Up the Volume will be on Monday, Vanilla Sky will be on Tuesday.
3782170	3782610	Just so you know.
3783070	3786031	And I'm probably going to be away from the computer quite a bit.
3786051	3786771	Don't tell them that.
3787091	3787471	Well, no.
3787531	3790132	But that has to do with Jamie's trip because she's leaving on Tuesday.
3790152	3791972	Yeah, because actually I packed today.
3792472	3793192	My clothes are packed today.
3793212	3793533	Oh, okay, cool.
3793753	3795533	I just have my other little things to pack.
3795613	3800514	And I'm hoping that people actually make requests this time around.
3801274	3805996	And lots of people listen, make it a good show for me because I won't be able to do it for two weeks.
3806096	3807616	But you get to hear old shows.
3808816	3809636	Yep.
3810277	3811697	But apart from that, you know.
3812313	3815434	Listen, request.
3815694	3817574	Also coming to the station in November.
3820455	3822976	Something that you guys have been asking me about for a long time.
3823196	3825436	Sunday, November 23rd.
3825536	3826376	Mark your calendars.
3826476	3832058	Sunday, November 23rd is season four of Orange Lounge Radio, the debut.
3832098	3834358	And that's going to be Jamie's return because she'll be back from Alabama.
3835078	3835899	And it's episode number 70.
3835939	3835999	And...
3838079	3841402	That is when the station is going to go to MP3 Pro.
3842903	3853071	Depending on Live 365's setup, we may or may not be able to have the live shows in MP3 Pro, but our Bomani Music Amore program will be in MP3 Pro.
3853091	3863499	For those that don't know what MP3 Pro is, we'll have details on our website at that point about how you can get DSL quality sound over your modem connection with MP3 Pro.
3863519	3864119	It's very cool.
3866883	3868144	What about cable quality?
3869145	3875250	Okay, cable, ISD, better quality, because life uses five plugs in its DSL quality.
3875270	3876191	I'm teasing.
3876231	3877072	Way better quality.
3877252	3877692	How about this?
3878052	3879233	Broadband quality.
3879253	3880254	There you go.
3880635	3882476	Broadband quality radio over your modem.
3882736	3883217	Power.
3883237	3883557	Great.
3884858	3885839	Oh, I had the ferret in the air.
3886039	3891604	And also, just before Jamie gets back from break, we will be setting the ferrets on fire live.
3891664	3892304	No!
3893565	3895047	I will hide the ferrets.
3896463	3897325	Hey, babies.
3899308	3901772	The ferrets love me, you hear?
3902052	3903454	Look, don't kill the babies.
3904396	3905778	You can't murder them!
3905798	3908222	You're gonna have to take them to Alabama with you if you don't want them to die.
3910563	3911724	You were anti-ferret.
3912725	3916449	I think that's all the news for now coming up to the station soon.
3916649	3917069	Yeah, you're right.
3917109	3917730	I'm anti-ferret.
3920813	3921754	There is one other thing.
3922454	3931623	I was hoping tonight we would have new Poppin' Music 10 MP3s to debut for you because we've gotten the connection to get the music for it.
3932361	3935664	There is some great stuff on the Papa Music 10 soundtrack.
3935804	3940268	Honestly, I know a lot of people have always been kind of, eh, Papa Music stuff's kind of cheesy, things like that.
3940348	3942910	But seriously, there's some good shit on Papa Music 10.
3944211	3945533	And you guys have to hear it.
3946553	3950357	For instance, Tack doing a duet with Desro.
3951295	3951836	Oh, God.
3951936	3952916	Very interesting.
3952956	3954377	It sounds a lot like Distress.
3955518	3962543	That would just make me so... Taco with a new trance song, and he got together with somebody, and I can't fucking remember who it was.
3962603	3963163	I apologize.
3963183	3965425	I'll have to see when I get the soundtrack.
3966145	3968006	And then, this is the greatest one of all.
3968807	3972129	Mr. T doing Goonies Are Good Enough.
3972429	3972990	Cool!
3973130	3976592	It is the coolest thing I've ever heard in a Bomondi game in my life.
3976772	3977673	I cannot wait.
3978373	3978974	So, um...
3980805	3981305	I can't wait.
3981825	3983446	That's going to be great.
3983466	3985327	I'm still looking forward to TAC.
3986707	3993770	What I'm thinking is maybe Thursday or so we'll have a Poppin' Music 10 debut special.
3993930	3995170	Something will be pre-taped.
3995190	3996010	It won't be a live thing.
3996351	3998831	Just some music so you guys can hear it.
4000492	4001292	That's going to be awesome.
4002393	4006114	I still remember being all happy about hearing the Yamato theme.
4007199	4008560	Yeah, the Yamato theme from Pop Music.
4008580	4010140	Maybe we'll play some Pop Music MP3s later.
4010480	4013682	And the Lem song.
4014682	4015042	What song?
4015362	4016443	The Lem theme song.
4016503	4020804	Oh, okay.
4023045	4024686	Urusei Yatsura, that was what it was.
4028837	4030998	So hopefully we'll have those pop music 10 MP3s for you soon.
4032699	4038402	There's also Guitar Freaks new music that's out too, but I don't know if there's anything on that worth playing right now.
4038462	4040242	Maybe we'll get to it later in the show.
4040262	4040603	We'll see.
4041643	4044985	I still think there should be more home versions of the Guitar Freaks games.
4045885	4046505	I do too.
4046966	4052268	I have a freaking drum manual controller and two Guitar Freaks controllers and no session.
4053068	4054069	No new sessions for me.
4056497	4059198	And they need to figure out how to get Keyboard Mania to work with it, too.
4059978	4060338	I agree.
4062578	4065719	My poor, dust-collected Keyboard Mania.
4067319	4068680	I haven't played Keyboard Mania.
4068760	4070900	I never even did bother to buy second and third.
4070920	4073681	Oh, I like second and third better than the first one.
4074401	4075081	You know what's nice?
4075121	4076401	I like the player in the second and third.
4076481	4083263	What's nice is I'll finally be able to dust off my 2DX controller because they have the signatures they needed or whatever to get the...
4084861	4087803	Get the new consumer style made.
4088964	4096508	I'm hoping that if I have the money available, I might just do the new arcade style controller release.
4097009	4097449	Ah, yes.
4098950	4101992	Just breaking down and ordering mine through Himeya.
4103193	4110477	I'm hoping that in the new 2DX consumer style, that they have every Konami original from 7th to 8th and 9th style.
4110517	4111438	That would be so beautiful.
4111718	4112199	I'd cry.
4113459	4114320	That would be pretty cool.
4114824	4120929	And you know, now that we've seen DDR Extreme, we know that Konami is willing to put 100 plus songs in a home mix.
4121069	4126374	So, there's no reason why they can't do DDR with us.
4126474	4129016	And then they need to put Tack in a box and ship him to my house.
4131778	4133540	Make him mix for me all day at gunpoint.
4134801	4138082	Well, let's see some other news going on right now in the Bomani world.
4139242	4141223	I wanted to read this for you guys.
4141443	4142703	I've got to pull up the story, though.
4143744	4144724	Jamie, fill time.
4146004	4153107	You know what?
4153507	4153707	What?
4153947	4155687	I'm sitting on the floor, and I don't know why.
4156288	4157488	Why are you sitting on the floor tonight?
4158644	4163511	It's comfy and it's not in front of the camera.
4164112	4165453	I can hide here effectively.
4167396	4169639	Not many places I can hide effectively from the webcam.
4170841	4172323	Actually, yeah, there are plenty of places.
4172631	4174612	Alright, here's what I wanted to get into.
4174692	4182495	It's the song list is released for DDR Xbox, DDR Ultramix, as a lot of us have been calling it, DDR Xbox.
4182535	4188838	The full song list is out, and so I thought we'd go over it and get your guys' reactions to the songs that are on it.
4189098	4189639	What do you guys think?
4189959	4190539	Loki, you with us?
4191379	4191740	Okay, cool.
4191760	4192620	.59 by DJ Taka.
4195948	4202750	Absolute, the Cuff and Stuff It Mix by Thuggy D, which would pretty much be Scotty D. That's stupid.
4203170	4203410	What?
4203730	4205271	It sounds kind of stupid, the name.
4205691	4212213	Yeah, the Cuff and Stuff It Mix sounds a little... I'm worried because I'm wondering if it's going to be like a rap version of Absolute, you know?
4212373	4215614	Okay, that would suck.
4216314	4218935	That would suck more than anything has sucked before.
4219815	4221535	Except for Let Them Move.
4221776	4223276	I'm going to just have high hopes.
4228194	4228714	Hi, we're still here.
4233116	4236257	Also on DDR Ultramix, After the Game of Love.
4236497	4242659	Notice it's not After the Game, but because Xbox will be a little more scandalous, they're going with After the Game of Love.
4242959	4243359	Happy.
4243880	4244900	So that's gone out.
4245756	4251638	A new transplant song from 2DX, Ballad For You, is going to be an Ultramix.
4251898	4252958	That should be interesting.
4254118	4260200	But it's Thomas Howard, so all you Thomas Howard fanboys and girls will be... That is not a good Thomas Howard song.
4260220	4262341	Well, like it or not, there it is.
4263201	4263941	Candy Heart...
4264986	4266867	will be in the new DDR.
4267247	4270168	Can't Stop Falling in Love, the speed mix by Naoki.
4270408	4271328	Oh, yay, speed mix.
4271349	4273129	Mandatory Naoki, mandatory speed mix.
4273569	4277451	A new licensed song, Castles in the Sky, Ian Vandal featuring Marsha.
4277511	4279051	That's going to be a song in Xbox.
4279452	4281512	Marsha, Marsha, Marsha!
4281532	4283433	We'll play that for you later in the show if we have time.
4284274	4284794	Does it suck?
4285254	4285814	It's pretty good.
4285854	4286354	I like it.
4286434	4289376	It's on the same par as Will I in Max 2.
4289596	4292997	I think I like Will I a little bit more, but Castles in the Sky is not bad.
4294068	4300430	Dive, by B4U Do That Thing, by Masai Drop the Bomb, the System SF remix
4323062	4334974	DXY by Tac, Electro-Tuned by Tac, Exotic Ethnic by Revengy, Healing Vision by Desire, At least it's not the stupid angelic mix.
4335334	4335574	What?
4335675	4336776	You don't like the angelic mix?
4338678	4342061	Oh my god, oh my god, stop, stop, stop.
4342705	4346188	The Angelic Mix is like one of my favorite remixes of any DDR song ever.
4346209	4349532	The Angelic Mix gives me a splitting headache every time I listen to it.
4349652	4350473	Is it just the beep?
4350733	4352635	Take the beep out, though, and it's a beautiful remix.
4352815	4353616	That's okay.
4353736	4354737	I still like the original better.
4354877	4355517	You are weird.
4357559	4359682	Hypnotic Crisis by the Blue Destroyers.
4360322	4361143	That should be interesting.
4361423	4362184	My first Kata.
4362384	4363165	That was my first Kata.
4364119	4369323	Hysteria by Naoki190, because you have to have your generic Konami trying to do rap song.
4370204	4376508	Another transplant from 2DX, and this is a really good one in my opinion, Infinite Prayer by LED.
4376868	4380871	And what's most interesting about that is I had heard rumors that LED had left Konami.
4380971	4386175	I don't know if they're true or not, but if I'm not mistaken, we haven't had any new LED songs in a while.
4386215	4388397	But kind of interesting, Infinite Prayer is going to be in DDR.
4388417	4388877	Which mix?
4388897	4389738	Is it just the standard?
4390673	4391354	It's the standard.
4391394	4393596	Wouldn't it be cool if they put the floating clock in?
4393936	4395217	Because that's my favorite mix of that.
4395938	4398840	It would be nice, and there are still ten unlocks, so you never know.
4398940	4401182	But this is the original that's going to be in it.
4401342	4406206	But the original original was, if I'm not mistaken, a club mix song before it was a 2DX song.
4406266	4408728	I think so.
4409008	4417355	Insertion, the Machine Gun Kelly mix, a remix of Insertion by Thuggy D. So we can look forward to a rap mix of Insertion.
4417395	4418236	That should be interesting.
4419696	4423557	But that might be kind of good because there's a lot of good rap out there about insertion.
4426198	4428478	Oh, by the way, there's something else I need to bring after this.
4428558	4429659	Oh, I'm going to stick my what?
4429679	4431159	I need to bring up something after the list.
4431319	4433400	All right.
4433440	4439762	Keep On Movin', the DMX mix by NMR Type G. It's kind of new, very interesting.
4440482	4441722	It's not new, says Loki.
4441762	4442402	Where is it from?
4443743	4444743	It's from Dance Maniacs.
4446427	4446567	Oh!
4447388	4448108	Oh, I'll be damned.
4448168	4448709	It sure is.
4449049	4449549	My bad.
4450590	4451010	My bad.
4453431	4454552	Oh, maybe we'll have to listen to that later.
4455213	4458875	Keep Your Body Movin' by Thuggy D. It's a new Konami original there.
4459555	4461576	Thuggy D. Oh, you have it?
4462277	4467060	Are we going to hear it if you... Okay, so this is a little bit of Keep On Movin' in the DMX mix.
4467540	4468140	Just a little clip.
4469941	4471783	I'm curious how different this is than the original.
4486095	4488844	It's kind of ghetto.
4489366	4490148	I don't think I like it.
4490269	4490590	Whatever.
4490931	4491593	Turn this shit off.
4493991	4495032	It sounds like a bad another.
4495332	4496993	God, I'm a stupid asshole.
4497053	4498374	DMX Mix, of course.
4498434	4499835	I mean, it's Dance Maniacs Mix.
4499935	4500695	God, I'm a tard.
4500936	4502136	You do know some rap mix.
4502176	4502437	Anyway.
4503437	4506139	Kind Lady by Okiatos.
4506219	4506659	Kind Lady.
4506699	4507380	We all know Kind Lady.
4507400	4507800	I like that song.
4507820	4509261	It's been in like every DDR mix.
4509281	4510242	You need the 80s one.
4510582	4511523	I like Kind Lady, too.
4511543	4512123	I'm glad it's there.
4512503	4514004	La Señorita Virtual.
4514465	4516246	The worst version of that song.
4516766	4521609	I don't think it's... I've heard much worse DDR mixes than La Señorita Virtual.
4521669	4523731	It doesn't... I never really cared for that one.
4524331	4525792	Okay.
4527072	4535556	Also going to be in DDR Ultra Mix will be Let the Beat Hit Em, classic R&B style, because it's just not DDR without some crappy mix of Let the Beat Hit Em.
4535916	4540698	You know, though, the only version of that one I really liked was the one that was in Max.
4541138	4541778	I think that's it.
4542378	4542859	That's the one.
4542999	4543779	Then that's the good one.
4544839	4545780	Let's Talk It Over.
4546460	4547460	That's a good song.
4547601	4548181	It's decent.
4548901	4550622	Look to the Sky, the True Color Mix.
4551762	4553323	Love to Me, the Disco Mix.
4554602	4555082	Cool!
4556103	4556743	By Yamato.
4558184	4558985	On the Jazz.
4559645	4560146	That's cool.
4561306	4562507	I'm kind of over On the Jazz.
4563007	4564468	Overblast by LED Light.
4565429	4568611	Paranoia Eternal, the fan-written Paranoia.
4569572	4571493	A New Transplant, new to DDUltraMix.
4571753	4573454	Quickening by DJ Taka.
4573734	4574635	That's a very cool one.
4576696	4581501	A licensed song, this will be a lot of fun, Paul Oakenfold with Ready Steady Go.
4581741	4582723	I don't know this song.
4582843	4583624	I have the CD.
4583664	4584224	It's on my CD.
4584605	4584865	Oh, cool.
4584905	4586166	It's like the first track, I think, on the...
4587268	4588168	On the Bucca CD.
4588228	4589449	Maybe we'll get to that song later.
4590930	4596092	Santa Malente Nante, of course, a fan favorite, Togo Project featuring Sana, that'll be good.
4596952	4598913	Secret Rendezvous by the Divas.
4599473	4599953	Ooh.
4600554	4602554	Sexy Planet by Crystal Aliens.
4602594	4609097	Kind of one of those songs that a lot of people thought we wouldn't see because American audiences can't handle the word sexy.
4609117	4610438	It's Sensual Planet!
4610458	4615140	It's Sensual Planet, but believe it or not, it is coming to DDR Ultramix.
4616903	4622566	This is the licensed song I'm most excited about, Shiny Disco Balls by Who Da Funk.
4623266	4624067	I love this song.
4624407	4625147	I can't wait to play it.
4625167	4625908	I've never heard it.
4626408	4628569	Late night, rock and roll, fellas.
4628889	4630951	Oh, we're going to hear a little clip of Shiny Disco Balls right here.
4631291	4632011	Can we hear a clip of it?
4632191	4632692	I'm not hearing it.
4637674	4638375	Get to the lyrics.
4638395	4638915	The lyrics are here.
4641963	4643523	We're skipping around the mp3 a little bit.
4643843	4646944	This is an extended mix of the song, so here we go.
4650245	4650865	I love this song.
4651845	4653445	It's really repetitive, but I love it.
4653465	4656766	Anyway, that'll be fun.
4656786	4657826	So In Love by Caramel S. Okay.
4657846	4657966	Okay.
4667560	4668861	That'll be in the Ultramix.
4669181	4671482	Superstar, DJ Rich featuring Tail Brothers.
4671522	4677765	God, has there been a home mix that Superstar was not on?
4677945	4681046	Sweet Sweet Heart Magic by June.
4682487	4684288	The Earth Light by LED Light.
4684428	4684948	That's cool.
4686849	4689650	A new Konami original by Thuggy D once again.
4689750	4690911	Therefore You.
4692239	4693120	That should be interesting.
4694341	4696703	Trip Machine, The Love Mix by 2MB.
4697263	4698124	The Love Mix.
4698524	4701006	And lastly, yes, Loki?
4701507	4701767	Go ahead.
4702227	4704829	Lastly, Sugaru, Revenge vs. Desire.
4705069	4705530	Yes, Loki?
4706150	4709113	There's also one that they didn't put on there, but it's going to be an unlock.
4709213	4711795	Mind Parasite from Dance Maniacs is going to be on there.
4713036	4715878	Also, Colors is rumored to be in the game as well.
4716259	4718921	Now, the interesting thing is, don't forget, there's ten unlocks.
4720884	4727609	But also, DDR Ultramix is going to have the pay for new songs feature, which is going to be interesting.
4727629	4728629	And this is what I've heard.
4729590	4731251	This is what's come off of DDR Freak.
4731291	4740238	I read in some post by Order of Chaos, who's the producer for DDR Ultramix, said something about five songs, five dollars.
4741959	4742400	What do you think?
4743180	4744441	Is this a good idea for DDR?
4744841	4745442	Shitty idea?
4745462	4745542	Yeah.
4746813	4749635	Only 10 unlocks this time, but 5 songs, $5.
4749695	4751816	What do you think, Loki?
4753337	4757280	That's fine, I'm sure, because it's obviously going to download to the hard drive.
4757820	4761722	So whenever there's a transfer of files, there'll be a way to pirate the songs.
4761762	4764624	And it doesn't matter anyways, because someone's going to buy it for $5.
4765465	4766545	Put the sim files online.
4766565	4772109	Dave apparently has forgotten about the little device called the Xbox GameShark.
4773454	4774614	and people with laptops.
4775154	4777315	Who can save those files to their laptops?
4778475	4782496	All illegality aside, let's assume we played by the legal way here.
4782536	4783476	What do you guys think of it?
4783756	4785517	That's $5 I could get a sandwich with.
4786157	4786597	That's only $5.
4786777	4792998	I mean, I throw $5 down for lunch, so, you know, I eat at home one day, I get five songs.
4793618	4800440	As long as they're not shit, because I can see it being, like, utter shit that they're going to put on there, but if it was good stuff, yeah.
4802384	4809469	Let Them Move, the Let Them Move remix, the, uh, you know, uh... The Let Them Move remix by... Uh, Forever Sunshine.
4811050	4813672	They have, like, a set of five that's all Newt remixes.
4814333	4814413	Ah!
4816954	4820737	Yes, they're going to have a pack with Forever Sunshine and Let Them Move.
4821397	4823739	And, God, what else is a DDR song no one likes?
4823759	4824099	Crash.
4825921	4827162	Crash, thank you.
4828423	4830204	And more B4U songs.
4830304	4832706	And then an original with Yoko Ono.
4834847	4835508	Yay!
4836308	4838930	The Bag For You, the Thuggy D remix.
4839331	4846396	Yes, it'll be Bag For You by Thuggy D. Featuring, um, what's her face from, from, uh,
4847071	4848373	You know what song needs to be in DDR?
4848513	4848793	What?
4848893	4849213	Shit.
4849954	4850315	Shit?
4850355	4851236	I don't know that song.
4852297	4852837	Panorama.
4853858	4855440	You know what's interesting about this mix?
4856121	4859004	You know what I'm just noticing that is very interesting about this mix?
4860005	4863189	There is only one song in this entire mix that has Politary in it.
4866858	4870020	I'm thinking one of those expansion packs.
4870140	4871181	I'm going to call it right here.
4871321	4875423	One of those expansion packs is going to be five Naoki featuring Politary songs.
4875683	4876224	God help us.
4876244	4877865	I'm going to bet you anything.
4878425	4880726	I know people that will buy it.
4881227	4883268	No, there's people who like the one who can't sing.
4883288	4888431	There's people who come to this show on Monday nights, this week, Tuesday, who like Politary.
4888511	4890232	So there are people out there who like Politary.
4892000	4893180	But I just think that's interesting.
4893200	4893520	You know what?
4893560	4899842	I wouldn't love this feeling to be in the new... Oh, there's a shitty DDR song I forgot about.
4899902	4900382	Hey!
4900462	4902382	I like that song.
4902502	4905743	And you remember why I... So when was Ultra Mix coming out again?
4906003	4906803	When was this coming out?
4907843	4911804	Ultra Mix is out November... Sometime this month.
4911844	4912724	I don't remember the date.
4913124	4913585	I think the 18th.
4913605	4913845	The 18th.
4916587	4917127	We'll see.
4918268	4921208	I want to get an Xbox anyway, so we'll see.
4921408	4922229	Hold this for a second.
4922389	4922709	I'll find out.
4922729	4923369	You're weak.
4925930	4927770	Oh, Jamie's going to make a phone call.
4927830	4929711	Actually, somebody in our chat room will probably post it.
4930451	4934132	But Jamie's going to get an official word.
4934152	4936753	Yeah, it's in the same post as the song list.
4937433	4937833	Thank you.
4938634	4942555	It is the November 18th.
4946306	4946586	Okay.
4949987	4958130	So, also rumored to be in the mix that we haven't seen any proof of yet, but Metal Gear Solid 2, the theme, I think it is.
4958371	4960811	Or maybe it's that mix from Six Mix.
4961452	4962572	Oh, yeah.
4962852	4963592	That would be awesome.
4963933	4964353	Very cool.
4966614	4968414	Do you have that Paul Loganfold song?
4968434	4969395	Do you want to play a little bit of that?
4970555	4971195	Oh, you don't have that one.
4971235	4972176	What about the other one that was in there?
4972196	4973276	There was another one we said we want to play.
4973336	4974597	Oh, Castles in the Sky, I have that one.
4974617	4975077	I have that.
4975762	4979185	You have that?
4979425	4981106	Let's race and see who can pull it up first.
4983388	4984369	This is really good radio.
4984609	4985610	I know, this is great radio.
4985850	4988472	By the way, I vouch for chloroseptic.
4989793	4990434	It really works.
4990534	4991094	Okay, got it.
4993056	4993936	Here's Castles in the Sky.
5015478	5017138	That's Castles in the Sky, if you're curious.
5017679	5018699	It sounds pretty typical.
5019439	5022880	Yeah, it sounds very much like Will I. I prefer Will I to that song.
5023280	5030022	But I heard a rumor that the steps were going to be insane to that song.
5030102	5030622	So we'll see.
5030842	5033942	They might have some really good original steps to that.
5035363	5037783	I have a little bit of news.
5038223	5038644	Oh, really?
5038784	5041104	Have you read anything on Yahoo?
5041384	5042204	Give me your news.
5042745	5044025	Now, the FCC...
5045385	5049067	has said that it is okay to say fuck on national television.
5049187	5049407	What?
5049547	5049847	Really?
5050468	5052729	As long as it is not used to describe fucking.
5054069	5059012	That's the same way, you know what, that's the same rule you can use to say the word fuck in a PG-13 movie.
5061353	5063554	You can't say asshole, but you can say ass.
5064354	5064915	Sweet.
5066355	5069317	So now you can say fuck on TV, I can't wait for next week's South Park.
5070072	5076977	If this is fucking annoying, or this is fucking stupid, or fuck him, or... I cannot wait for next week's South Park.
5077217	5081841	But yeah, it was like, and then I came up, I think it was someone who was accepting an award.
5082141	5083562	They go, well, this is fucking awesome.
5084463	5085563	Oh yeah, I heard about that.
5085643	5086764	And the SEC got a bunch of letters.
5087845	5093289	And it was like, well, he didn't actually say that, like, I'm going to go fuck this person.
5093309	5095791	I'm going to go home and fuck my wife.
5101883	5103925	Chat room's itching for us to get our cage match on.
5104425	5105666	What do you guys think?
5105726	5106306	Let's do it.
5106646	5107587	All right, let's do it.
5108368	5109929	I didn't have to think of one this week.
5109969	5110389	Yeah, I know.
5110409	5111350	You got saved this week.
5111410	5113371	Let's do the Orange Launch cage match tonight, shall we?
5115513	5116253	You know what sucks?
5117074	5117234	What?
5117254	5120096	I think I deleted Holic off my computer.
5120816	5121277	That's okay.
5121297	5122057	I know it's on Loki's.
5122077	5122758	I can get it through there.
5123519	5125280	How dare you delete any tax?
5125400	5127842	I had to delete so much stuff.
5127902	5129023	Buy a hard drive!
5129083	5132165	To make room for Final Fantasy XI, it's not even funny.
5132185	5133225	Get a hard drive!
5133806	5134906	That's alright, we have Holly.
5134946	5135687	You wanna know what?
5135927	5136267	What?
5136287	5141351	I have a 120 gig hard drive, and I've used, um, 50 of it.
5144453	5146574	I need to start burning all stuff off of my hard drive.
5147374	5147635	Alright, ready?
5147655	5148215	Because I'm lazy.
5148835	5151257	Tonight, in the Orange Lounge Cage Match,
5153891	5157495	Last week in the cage match, Jamie won the cage match.
5158336	5160338	And her song was, you want to introduce it?
5161255	5166919	It was Little Flower by Cyberex featuring Rapina, wasn't it?
5167239	5167800	I think it was.
5168600	5170161	And it won by quite a landslide.
5171142	5173444	So will it win by a landslide again tonight?
5173544	5173884	I don't know.
5173924	5174284	We'll see.
5174545	5179408	The way the cage match works, the three of us are going to pick a song, and you're going to pick your favorite.
5179988	5190456	And your favorite, determined by your votes that are sent to me in the chat room once we've done playing all three songs, your vote will determine what song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.
5191377	5193459	So here it is, song number one that you can vote for tonight.
5193499	5194600	Jamie's pick from last week.
5194620	5195060	Which one?
5195100	5197162	And you only get to hear a clip of it because it is the winner.
5197703	5201105	This is Cyber X featuring Rapinoe with Little Flower.
5201246	5201506	Enjoy.
5259051	5260353	Thank you for watching!
5349798	5351699	Thank you for watching!
5404833	5406034	Alright, that was song number one.
5406114	5409217	Last week's winner, CyberX featuring Rapinoe with Little Flower.
5410438	5413381	Alright, and I forgot to put that in the chat room.
5413461	5415342	Usually I announce what songs one and two are.
5415402	5418825	So, Jamie, tell us how wonderful that song is while I do that part.
5418846	5420087	I think it's a nine.
5420667	5421428	It's trancy.
5421808	5422529	No, no, no, no, no, no.
5422569	5423650	You already rated it last week.
5423690	5425091	You just have to go on about how great it is.
5425511	5426172	It's awesome.
5426372	5430556	You really, really like the song because y'all really seem like tramps.
5431474	5433636	and it doesn't get much trance-ier than that.
5434597	5440681	Unless it's Das Schrockenspiel, which puts me in a trance every time I drive and I usually run into things.
5441322	5443984	Alright, Loki insists I do his song next.
5445507	5446228	Oh, he's going to find it.
5446248	5447149	Well, then I'm going to go next.
5447569	5450552	All right, my song I've picked tonight is kind of an older song.
5450592	5451433	It's a few years old.
5451873	5458960	And actually, those of you that listen to Understation Live on a regular basis may recognize this song because I know it's one of Travis' favorite break songs.
5459020	5464445	But I've just been really addicted to this song lately, and I think it would be awesome for DDR.
5464525	5467388	In fact, I'm going to convince Loki to put it on his bootleg mix that he does.
5468608	5472010	But I love this song a lot, and I hope you guys do too.
5472350	5476612	I really didn't have any other good choices for tonight, so I picked a nice little poppy techno song for you guys.
5476632	5478233	I forgot to make a comment on the chat room.
5478313	5478593	Okay.
5479294	5484456	Oki is not spelled with an H. It's O-O-K-I if you're going by Papa Romaji.
5484796	5485137	Thank you.
5486137	5487018	Well, thank you for clarifying.
5487518	5487758	All right.
5488689	5489971	Now, back to Gage Match.
5489991	5490392	Sorry.
5490552	5491233	That's alright, it's alright.
5492535	5496442	The song I picked is Tina Cousins, and it's called Mysterious Times.
5496682	5497423	So I hope you guys enjoy.
5580837	5581866	Thanks for watching!
5643051	5644895	You'll only see what you see
5689433	5690814	Thank you for watching!
5712142	5714083	Okay, that was song number two tonight.
5714103	5716264	That was Tina Cousins with Mysterious Times.
5717204	5717904	And what'd y'all think?
5717924	5718185	Jamie?
5718705	5720245	Um, it was pretty good.
5720365	5723006	It was, uh, kind of repetitive.
5723087	5724147	I'm eating rice.
5724427	5725447	I got good rice, too.
5726388	5727648	It doesn't taste like minute rice, either.
5727668	5729489	Um, but no.
5730990	5731490	It was okay.
5732250	5733511	I give it an eight.
5734431	5734731	Loki!
5736552	5737452	It was okay.
5738053	5738333	Seven.
5741278	5747923	Um, I was kind of strapped for songs this week, so I know that's not the best I can do, but I still like it.
5748063	5750145	I mean, it's a perfect DDR song.
5750185	5753087	It's so perfect for DDR, so I give it eight or nine.
5753468	5753848	Eight and a half.
5754649	5756410	All right, Loki, what's your pick for this week?
5759086	5764827	My pick for this week is Cool and the Gang, and it's a song called Get Down on It.
5764947	5772389	It's the DJ Jimmy Jam's, I've got to get the full title here as it scrolls on by here.
5774329	5781651	It's a Bootleg remix by DJ Jimmy Jam, whatever that is, and it's Get Down on It 2001.
5784437	5785139	by Kool and the Gang.
5786543	5787526	Alright, let's try it out.
5787586	5787967	Here it is.
5788248	5789131	Loki's pick for this week.
5789151	5789672	Kool and the Gang.
5789713	5790274	Get down on it.
5889878	5890903	We don't wanna dance
6147381	6148422	Okay, sorry about that.
6148702	6151365	Um, we were, um... Sorry, I had to get food.
6151445	6151725	...eating.
6151745	6154187	Let me turn that down.
6155488	6156049	Sorry!
6156529	6158591	Alright, uh, Cooling the Gang with Get Down On It, 2001.
6159832	6160132	Jamie.
6161774	6163796	It made me think of roller skating for some reason.
6164917	6169501	Um, it gets a 7.5 for nostalgic coolness.
6170393	6170713	Loki.
6171694	6175475	I give it a 9 because it's like the second song that's on my CD that I'm listening to right now.
6175715	6178197	First one being last week's pick that no one seemed to like.
6182178	6182498	I give it a 3.
6183039	6183479	It's boring.
6183979	6184459	I didn't like it.
6185400	6186720	You get no rice now.
6186980	6188101	I hope you choke on it.
6188601	6190802	You give my songs shitty scores all the time.
6190822	6192703	I gave it a 7, you ass.
6192723	6193824	This is an exception.
6194384	6195244	I didn't like it.
6195424	6196025	Deal with it.
6198106	6200768	Cool in the Gang is usually good.
6201068	6202189	Cool in the Gang is usually good.
6202209	6203289	It just wasn't good.
6203750	6204110	Alright.
6204770	6206692	And what if it was Jungle Boogie?
6207192	6208633	Alright, who gives a shit what I think?
6208693	6209874	It's up to the chat room now.
6210314	6213696	Send your votes in the sky over private message once we recap here.
6214177	6216698	Here are the three songs you can vote for tonight in tonight's cage match.
6216758	6222702	Last week's winner, Cyber X featuring Rapinoe with Little Flower is the first song you can vote for this week.
6224463	6225224	If I can get a clip of it.
6236491	6241153	Alright, song two you can vote for this week is Tina Cousins with Mysterious Times.
6244133	6261739	Alright, and song number three you can vote for this week is Kool and the Gang with Get Down On It, the DJ Jimmy Jam mix.
6270647	6276651	Alright, send those votes in now over private message to Sky in the chat room.
6279213	6285216	Alright, Loki, is there anything going on in the sim world this week that's worth talking about?
6287478	6287898	Uh, no.
6289059	6291120	I have my beeps, I apologize, if you guys, oh, sorry.
6292386	6299369	If you guys are hearing beeps over the air, I apologize, I don't, they're not turned off for some reason, they got turned back on, so just deal with it.
6300330	6308013	Um, no, nothing really going on, unless you count, like, Turning Mix 4th Plus, but, uh, no.
6309934	6311935	Yeah, why don't you turn it off, you lazy bastard?
6312775	6313656	What do I turn it off at?
6316017	6317618	Yeah, people don't like hearing beeps.
6317998	6318378	Shut up.
6320191	6321792	I'll see if I can find the sounds option.
6322032	6324274	Well, sort of sim-related, I guess.
6325774	6339463	It's been noted on a few of the message boards that that stupid bootleg DDR Megamix is actually running off a ported version of Step Mania to the System 573 boards, which, you know... Really?
6339643	6344506	For those who don't know what that is, that's the hardware that all DDR machines run off of.
6346527	6356093	So it's technically Step Mania running on that and some special software and a hacked security chip.
6358215	6359816	So why did the freeze arrows look like shit?
6360036	6362397	Because some of the files were corrupted on the disk.
6363138	6363538	That's why.
6365139	6366760	It was supposed to look nicer than that.
6368822	6372204	But it doesn't matter though because it's still just DDR Extreme.
6372224	6373605	They didn't add any new songs.
6375986	6377607	My favorite, though, is Don't Fall Off.
6378227	6380049	Yeah, Don't Fall Off.
6381089	6383051	Or the AT-ST will step on you.
6386431	6414518	Anyways, yeah, that's pretty much all that's going on, nothing really big other than that, I mean, I'm sure, I think they're in the process of making DDR, um, or Dancing Stage Fever, converting the songs over for Stepmania, and they're still working on DDR Extreme, even though I could have had them done weeks ago, but I just don't care anymore, so, you don't get them from me, so there, and, um, yeah, that's pretty much it, nothing really, oh,
6415231	6417720	Well, we could talk about Into the Groove.
6417760	6418683	I guess that's similar.
6418703	6419105	Why not?
6419145	6419607	Go for it.
6421920	6428621	A new arcade dancing game that's being developed by the people that do Step Mania.
6429182	6433322	Chris Danford, Kiel, who you might remember, we have a song of his in rotation.
6433982	6438783	And also Foyboy, I guess, or Fubi, I forget which one it was.
6439584	6445465	I think it was Fubi, because he does the steps on DWI Insanity.
6447085	6450626	So basically they're making their own home version, or not home version, but...
6451486	6465389	eventually is going to go there, but right now they're doing arcade mixes with this into the groove thing, which it's like DDR, it's more like, I don't know, it's just really weird looking.
6466434	6467235	That's all I got to say.
6484229	6485711	They're doing those there.
6485731	6492198	But so far, it's like, I don't know, I've listened to some of the music on there, and it sucks.
6492819	6493940	It sucks really bad.
6494361	6501810	I mean, Kiel's good and all for, I guess, making music, but I don't like any of the music that's in there so far.
6501830	6503612	You just think they picked the wrong ones to put in the game.
6505509	6507113	I don't know, they're just lame.
6507213	6507975	They suck.
6508075	6511764	It's just like playing that other game I was playing earlier.
6512025	6513228	Oh, we'll have to talk about that later, too.
6515339	6517280	God, no, it's not very good.
6517320	6526243	They're like, this one guy posted this mp3 of the song Utopia that he loves, and I downloaded it and listened to it, and it's crap.
6526483	6527103	I don't like it.
6527163	6528463	I think it's retarded.
6528483	6530424	Well, you know, that's just your big fat opinion.
6530784	6534605	Well, my big fat opinion counts because... You have a microphone.
6535085	6536046	Yeah, I have a microphone.
6536106	6537246	I have pretty good taste in music.
6537286	6539287	There's a lot of music, you know...
6539807	6540447	Thank you for watching!
6567761	6570502	This is the stuff that should be in there, but isn't.
6571063	6577025	But they're going to license music, they say, which I don't think they're going to actually physically license music.
6577085	6586169	But anyways, the whole thing runs off of Linux, because they don't want to pay for Windows XP for every single machine.
6586249	6587569	So it's running off of Linux.
6588089	6590871	It's pretty much a reworked StepMania.
6590911	6594172	It's more or less StepMania, and they have different arrows and stuff.
6594693	6598478	New mods and shit and mines and all the crap that Stepmania has.
6599960	6601142	It's just, I don't know.
6602424	6603245	I watch people play.
6603325	6606230	Oh, and there's songs with 11 and 12 footer steps.
6606920	6609442	I think that is so unnecessary.
6609602	6610243	It's retarded.
6610263	6617629	I guess I shouldn't knock it until I've tried it, but I think the whole notion of songs that were built to kill people is just unnecessary.
6617789	6620631	Honestly, Max Period was overdoing it.
6620651	6622052	It was overdoing it.
6622132	6626396	That end where it gets 600 beats per minute and stuff, that was just, it gets gay.
6627177	6628858	Not to mention that the song was ass.
6629478	6633582	It's just, it was really, really stupid what they're doing with it, but you know.
6634739	6635199	Whatever.
6635760	6638401	They say it's 50% done.
6638522	6641063	They can always change that stuff later if people don't like it.
6641564	6647768	But the people they have testing it, if they're like, ooh, I get the bar rape on this song, it's harder than Legend of Max.
6648508	6657374	With all due respect to the folks up in Seattle, there are the unreal players up there who can do this 11 and 12 stuff no problem.
6658206	6661770	I just, I worry that that's going to influence the development of the mix.
6661810	6667555	And it's just like, you know, okay, maybe one or two songs, yay, great, but keep it to a minimum.
6668096	6670838	Me, personally, I enjoy those fun 7 feet songs.
6671039	6672941	I like some of the Max 2 USA Steps.
6672981	6674102	I realize I'm in a minority.
6674642	6678843	But I kind of like the fun stuff more than I like the let's kill me steps, you know?
6678883	6684645	The whole point is, I mean, sure people like a challenge, but people like fun, intelligent steps, too.
6684685	6687886	There's a lot of songs that have intelligent steps, like Superstar.
6687926	6690167	Superstar's a fun song to play, and it's not that hard.
6691607	6692207	It's just fun.
6692287	6693008	That's the whole point.
6693448	6694688	And people play them over and over.
6694948	6700630	I mean, once you play a really hard song, the only reason you play it is to show off to friends and say, oh, look, I beat this song.
6700650	6701990	I mean, that's pretty much it.
6702010	6703651	It's not like you play it for your own benefit.
6706458	6709019	I don't know.
6709460	6713742	The whole idea about, you know, what the hell?
6714342	6715823	Just let Jamie play with the webcam.
6715843	6716403	She's having fun.
6716503	6717083	Okay, okay.
6717684	6724687	Anyway, it's the whole point of people making these bootlegs and stuff.
6724807	6733031	It's just, I don't know, it's very interesting to me and how Konami, because technically Konami can't really do much about it.
6733647	6736868	because the machines aren't supposed to be over here in the first place.
6737288	6744409	And they're kind of just getting by licensing in various manners by pretending they don't exist type of thing.
6745429	6747970	And so kind of people have free reign on doing that.
6748210	6752831	The only people that can come down on them are people in the United States like the RIAA and stuff like that.
6753971	6757872	Now, I think where they're going to run into trouble is because they're selling the machine, and that's a problem.
6758490	6771147	Now, my thing on it, which I was posing to our local arcade here, is that you just do one custom homemade upgrade for...
6773750	6774310	One Arcade.
6774771	6779332	I think the damage done by that would be minimal and the risk on it isn't that bad.
6779913	6782333	The repercussions would be like nothing.
6783174	6788336	So I posed that idea to our arcade manager and they're actually interested.
6788956	6790056	So I don't know.
6790177	6790517	We'll see.
6791857	6802205	But I know later this week I'm going down to the arcade and we're going to rip open the machine to see what we can do as far as feasibly upgrading it that way.
6803026	6808550	And all I've got to say is if I do end up doing that, it's going to look nice and it'll be a lot better than all this other shit.
6809091	6813414	And I've got word from... I heard this.
6813434	6814575	This was pretty big news.
6815780	6816521	Well, supposedly.
6816601	6816981	I don't know.
6817241	6820224	They posted this about the next generation DDR.
6820584	6822105	Oh, yeah?
6822325	6825107	But it's going to be coming out in like two or three years.
6825508	6826769	Oh, my God.
6827689	6828170	Yeah.
6828230	6832693	What about this Euromix that they're getting that's going to be on the new hardware, supposedly?
6832993	6834394	Well, that's Euromix.
6834855	6837056	But still... They get stuff.
6837077	6840339	Well, remember, if you remember... It'll be a preview of what we can expect.
6840359	6844002	They were supposed to do new hardware with DDR Extreme, but they never did.
6844022	6844722	True, true.
6845023	6845303	So...
6847926	6854550	I mean, for all this talk that DDR is dead in Japan, I mean, then why was Xtreme the number 7 selling game its debut week in the top 10?
6854590	6855130	It doesn't matter.
6855150	6856071	Look at QDX.
6857091	6859513	You have to freaking beg for a new game.
6859633	6860713	That's a whole other story, though.
6860734	6862254	That's just Konami being dicks.
6864816	6866997	Alright, you guys want to know who won the cage match tonight?
6867017	6869318	Sure.
6869338	6874301	Tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge cage match is Holic.
6874661	6875182	No, it's...
6877503	6879324	It is a tie, ladies and gentlemen.
6881385	6882325	The tie tonight.
6882345	6883886	Stop tying people, God.
6883926	6885947	I know, they always tie like every week.
6886067	6890489	We used to never have ties, and lately in like past eight shows we've had like six ties.
6890969	6893671	Anyway, the tie tonight is between two songs.
6894551	6897353	It's between last week's winner, Little Flower.
6904136	6904296	And...
6905023	6910625	The second song that tied this week is Cooling the Gang with Get Down On It, the 2001 mix.
6912806	6924049	So, as you know, when we have a tie in the Orange Lounge Cage Match, the host who did not win in the tie would get to break that tie.
6924109	6925310	And, oh, that's me tonight.
6926210	6928131	My song only got one stinking vote.
6929071	6930211	Your song sucks.
6930631	6931472	That being said...
6933516	6934499	This is a no-brainer.
6934539	6938088	I vote for Jamie's.
6939170	6940313	Loki, you the man.
6941755	6951357	But that song is the suck, so I pick Little Flowers, this week's cage match winner, for two weeks in a row, so enjoy.
6951497	6952558	I like the dog.
6953538	6963600	That's alright, I was going to pick something really shitty, but I could not find that damn track for the life of me.
6964461	6965681	It was Boys for Love.
6966501	6967502	Hey, what?
6967782	6968643	Boys for Love.
6969144	6971586	And it was a song about being gay, but I couldn't find it.
6972186	6974028	And it was really funny.
6974288	6977330	It's just like, it's a DDR song I had, but I can't find it.
6977531	6978411	I don't know where it went.
6978972	6980053	Are you going to put it in your mix?
6982915	6984036	I could, that would be funny.
6984056	6986318	If I find it, maybe.
6987139	6987499	Alright.
6991322	6994345	So... I think I'll take a break.
6997366	7000507	When we come back, we'll do the FUs of the week.
7000667	7003228	So send those over private message to Sky.
7003248	7004348	Hi, I'm in the chat room.
7004448	7008869	And if you have something to bitch about, we're going to get it out in the open on this next break.
7009569	7012190	In the meantime, we've done a TAC break.
7012230	7013250	We've done a TACA break.
7013951	7018192	I think now, like it or not, I think it's time to do Naoki break.
7018212	7018832	What do you guys think?
7020833	7021333	Don't cry.
7022353	7023873	No, we're going to play some good Naoki stuff.
7023913	7025574	So we will be right back after this break.
7077400	7078802	Thanks for watching!
7243502	7244184	Thanks for watching!
7347918	7356440	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter D, the letter A, and the number 59.
7356480	7362241	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
7362622	7366703	Hello everybody, it's time to do the FUs of the week.
7367023	7369643	Jamie, what are the FUs of the week all about?
7370003	7372644	Where we get pissed off and tell everybody.
7388414	7390756	My first FU of the week is a very important one.
7392797	7394158	FU to adultery.
7396080	7401524	I'm not going to go into specifics about it because it involves a pretty good friend of mine.
7403846	7406848	But there's no excuse for it.
7408201	7417165	and I can't really vouch for anyone who goes through with it who is... I'm not getting into details, but just in general.
7418205	7419605	I can't, I can't stand it.
7420986	7421226	So.
7421686	7422206	Next thing!
7422226	7434271	Um, uh, F you to people who go 10 miles under the speed limit in front of you and then people who match your speed in the lane next to you so that you can't change lanes.
7436512	7436612	Um...
7439082	7442667	You know what, I'm not really all that angsty because I'm still looking forward to my vacation.
7443988	7444409	Gasp.
7445751	7454442	F you to probably not having reliable internet access while I'm in Alabama.
7455455	7456435	But I'll do what I can.
7457036	7462417	And of course, F you for no remote way of me contributing to the show.
7465958	7466859	That's really about it.
7466979	7468379	I did, however, notice something.
7469019	7474181	The Radio Shack logo looks remarkably like the Battle Royale logo.
7475201	7476602	I think it's a government plot.
7478403	7482604	They're gonna make us all kill each other with remote-controlled cars, batteries, and Walkmans.
7484747	7486549	and PhilPort, a PCS for everybody.
7487070	7487470	Okay.
7489212	7489592	E.T.
7489632	7490133	Stallio.
7493617	7494097	All right.
7494758	7495459	Loki, you ready?
7498702	7499744	I caught the mic.
7500464	7500965	Okay.
7504415	7506857	Actually, yes, I am.
7508078	7510901	Fuck you, you stupid bastards at Golf Land.
7511462	7515445	Not necessarily people, because, you know, people will be stupid and they'll flock no matter.
7516826	7522732	Yes, I'm saying the bastards working behind the snack counter at Golf Land yesterday around 7 p.m.
7525057	7529441	You suck because first off you had to go make a stupid comment about my shirt.
7529642	7534707	Yes, I know what my shirt says and the fact that you comment about it does not make you seem any more intelligent.
7535768	7544656	And I don't care if your friend is afraid of ninja monkeys or ninja squirrels or any ninja rodent of whatever the case may be.
7545537	7548020	I don't care and I also don't care that
7548815	7575255	you're out of the large cup size, I want a soda, give me a fucking soda and just because you're stupid enough to drop the piece of pizza on the floor and you give me the larger slice by calling it the special piece of pizza, I don't really care and the fact that you tried to give me the piece of pizza attached to the giant cardboard circle it was on there to begin with I want it on a fucking plate
7575976	7579279	And you try to get me on this giant piece of cardboard, what the hell am I supposed to do with that?
7580499	7581861	This guy was a complete idiot.
7582941	7585103	Not surprising, you know, working at Golfland.
7586104	7586564	But yes.
7587905	7597432	Um, other than that, um, I don't like the cold, so fuck you Mother Nature for making it cold all of a sudden.
7597592	7600475	It was like 90 degrees one day, and then it dropped down to 50.
7601565	7606287	You can't just drop the temperature 40 degrees and expect anyone to, like, not care.
7609589	7610509	I have a comment to make.
7611810	7612150	Okay.
7612390	7617733	I talk to what the weather is in Alabama right now, and at nighttime, the low is 66 degrees.
7619053	7621395	Oh, that's cool.
7622515	7627698	And fuck you to my bank, because I was overdrawn on my account for, like, five bucks, and they charged me 60.
7629398	7630499	So, they suck.
7633001	7633481	Sue them!
7633501	7634961	I can't sue them.
7635041	7637342	All you have to do is get a credit card with your bank.
7638022	7641182	So if you overdraft, it pulls from your card and you're not charged any fines.
7641663	7643603	Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
7643923	7645483	See, I used to do that, too.
7645623	7646803	I used to have a credit card.
7647063	7648144	That's a big mistake.
7648184	7654145	Because not only do they charge you the $30 for overdrafting, they charge you a fee on your credit card, too.
7654625	7656065	It's just a big scam.
7657085	7658385	What bank do you bank with?
7658605	7659266	Wells Fargo.
7659566	7660306	No wonder.
7660386	7660966	Hell's Cargo.
7663228	7667150	So anyways, yeah, they suck, but whatever.
7667650	7668531	So, I'm done.
7672432	7672832	Alright.
7676794	7679775	My FU this week is a real no-brainer for me, actually.
7681536	7691760	Usually I have to sit here and think about what I'm going to say FU of the week to for a long time, but this week it's easy because I got really pissed off at Final Fantasy XI earlier this week.
7692429	7704777	so my app used to play online the Sony people because when you put in your credit card information you can't put in a space bar your name is not allowed to have spaces if you don't
7706666	7711129	I'm sorry, if you have a space in your name, you don't exist to the Final Fantasy people.
7711730	7715372	So, I had to call tech support and all that stuff.
7715672	7720395	And they don't take... They won't register you over the phone at tech support for whatever reason.
7720415	7720915	I don't know why.
7721236	7723517	I'm sure if I bitched or whined enough, they probably would have.
7723537	7726099	But luckily, the guy and I were able to make it work somehow, so...
7726619	7727900	I finally was able to get online.
7727940	7731943	The guy on the other end of the line at PlayOnline was actually very nice.
7731963	7738027	It was very good customer service and tech support, so it helped ease my anger a little bit.
7738067	7743711	But whoever thought that one up to disable the space bar, come on, why do you disable keys?
7743751	7745292	You never know when somebody might need to use it.
7745452	7750075	And for the record, I go by my middle name, actually, so I use my first initial.
7750435	7754378	My bank has me in the system as my first initial space middle name.
7755118	7758979	So, I'm something space Robert in the system.
7759339	7760319	So, that's why.
7761280	7763540	Yeah, I know you know, but we can keep it a secret.
7763960	7765401	I promise.
7765501	7766941	And it's a nice name for me.
7767461	7768442	So, whatever.
7769602	7770182	Name shmame.
7770662	7775243	So, screw you, whoever decided to come up with that disabling the space bar.
7775263	7777504	We're out in hell.
7778303	7781785	And it took me, I'll also FU to Final Fantasy XI because it took me about five hours to install.
7782065	7784326	But once I got in there, oh, fuck, it's beautiful.
7786066	7790328	I'm wondering if I installed the data I have, if it would work.
7790588	7793930	Either way, you're going to have to sit there and download the two-hour patch.
7794650	7797171	I doubt it will work, but it's worth a try.
7797191	7800012	You don't have to pay for anything.
7800032	7801893	Because I know there's people who already have.
7802882	7804864	I think the beta people had to upgrade, I think.
7804904	7805805	That's stupid.
7807186	7808527	Thank God for Ragnarok.
7808547	7810029	Alright.
7810990	7812111	Into the chatroom, FUs.
7814733	7820679	Bag4U says, Hey Sky, send an FU to Konami for being anal about the 2DX release.
7822560	7824222	I agree, that was kind of stupid of Konami.
7825705	7829866	23rd Magus says, F you to slow leveling in Ragnarok Online.
7830386	7833546	F you to my DDR skills slipping, I can't pass Sakura anymore.
7833907	7836627	And a big F you to concert tickets being so overpriced.
7836987	7838787	I'm sorry, but $30 a seat?
7838927	7839187	What?
7839447	7840948	You want to rate my wallet some more?
7841088	7841508	Damn.
7842088	7843888	Hey, $30 is actually pretty cheap for a concert.
7843908	7844488	Don't feel bad.
7844628	7847609	I was pricing the tickets for Alan Jackson and they're $45 apiece.
7848429	7850029	You want to go see Elton John in Vegas?
7850089	7851870	Prepare to pay $100 for the cheap seats.
7853570	7853890	Crazy.
7856607	7858668	God, it's just nuts how much some tickets cost.
7859048	7864230	John Fields would like to say, F you to Microsoft, your piece of shit software thinks my D drive is corrupt.
7864310	7868332	Now I have to rebuild my computer while trying to save as many files as I can.
7868392	7871093	Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you Microsoft and your XPOS.
7871553	7873254	Fuck you to twisting my ankle today.
7873414	7874834	Oh, and fuck you to Microsoft again.
7874934	7880677	Why not just use a second hard drive and move the data?
7880997	7881477	You know what?
7882579	7887360	When I installed Final Fantasy XI, something similar happened to me where it was trying to boot for my disk drive.
7888401	7891521	And thank God Brad was here because he was able to fix it.
7891861	7892742	I wouldn't have known what to do.
7892802	7894062	I would have broken down and cried.
7894982	7896663	At the $50, I would have wasted on nothing.
7898623	7898903	All right.
7900384	7900864	Let's see.
7900984	7905685	Joe Mama would like to say, My FU of the week is to the shitty PC controls for Final Fantasy XI.
7907400	7913386	I got used to the PC controls myself, but I received a tip from LankyStyle, who was a beta tester for Final Fantasy XI.
7913426	7914767	He says, use a Kiki Joy.
7914807	7915968	It makes it a lot easier.
7916388	7920512	Get the PlayStation controller hooked up to the computer, and you'll enjoy Final Fantasy XI a lot more.
7921433	7922374	I will try that in the future.
7923482	7932965	Snub Dishonored says, Fuck the children that didn't come to my house and left me with about five full pounds of Kit Kats, Twixes, and various other assorted candies.
7933245	7934045	You're complaining?
7934085	7934606	I'll take them.
7935266	7937827	Now I have to eat all this crap or throw it out.
7938027	7940187	Thanks a lot, you fucking overprotective parents.
7940227	7942348	You're saving your kids but killing my bowels.
7942868	7944709	Runs to bathroom to shit out chocolate.
7944729	7945369	So that's lovely.
7946067	7949969	Maybe I should have poisoned my candy to give those parents a real reason to keep their kids at home.
7950049	7952510	Yeah, then you'd still be stuck with it, and then you'd just have to throw it away.
7952530	7953791	God, it's a waste of chocolate.
7953971	7954291	I know.
7954451	7954991	You know what?
7955051	7955771	Take it to school.
7960394	7960514	No, 830.
7962276	7976264	Wampa164 would like to say, fuck you to the hot topic raver wannabe 14 year olds who spend their entire weekend from Friday until Sunday at the mall's arcade and causing me to not single digit grade exotic ethnic, going from 4 grades within 15 seconds left to 14.
7979126	7981867	This T underscore T brought to you by me.
7984389	7984769	Minced.
7986002	7987884	Went home from college for the weekend.
7988004	7989465	That's the basis of my FU.
7989945	7991226	FU to the local arcade.
7991246	7992587	They now have a pump-it-up machine.
7992627	7995930	It lags every time you hit an arrow and sometimes the song will just cut out.
7996710	7999372	They should have gotten the second DDR machine they said they were gonna get.
7999512	8002735	Fuck you to it raining for 11 days straight over here.
8002875	8005117	Maybe they don't know the difference between pump-it-up and DDR.
8008616	8013002	Zodiac Knight would like to say, I have no fuck you's because I love everyone equally.
8014364	8015085	Awww.
8017027	8017728	Hairball, sorry.
8020091	8025418	Pixie Dust would like to say, okay, fuck this, I'm actually happy, I only have three F you's this week.
8026860	8031103	Fuck Bacardi151 and being drunk to the point where I passed out when I got home.
8031543	8034184	Fuck dieting because I'm still the same damn weight.
8034545	8039808	And as always, just because what if you wouldn't be complete without Pixie Dust saying, Fuck having big boobs.
8039968	8043870	I can't do step aerobics properly with these things flopping like two puppies.
8044550	8046332	Okay, I'm done and love you, Rob.
8047252	8047932	Love you too.
8048213	8048793	You know what?
8049173	8051515	And notice how no love for Jamie or Loki.
8051555	8052495	It's all me.
8052655	8053055	Oh, shut up.
8053096	8053656	I'm the best.
8054762	8055863	No, you know what?
8056163	8060166	They make an exercise bra that's really good for big boob women.
8061607	8063609	I used it for a while.
8065530	8065910	Boobs.
8068172	8068833	Yes, Loki?
8070374	8071114	What are you doing, Loki?
8074497	8075758	I'm going to go to the next FU.
8075838	8076819	I just need someone to comment on.
8076839	8077139	What?
8077159	8080301	Oh, what do you want to comment on?
8081242	8082503	BananaBoobs.com?
8082543	8082723	No.
8083403	8083504	Um...
8085546	8085766	Yes.
8089708	8093089	About the dieting thing, don't diet, do a lifestyle adjustment.
8094610	8095010	That's good.
8096631	8099472	Oh, and she says in the public chat room, love you, Jamie.
8100733	8102174	Yay, we love you too.
8104294	8105455	What's the link you're going to post?
8107296	8109737	Some boob thing, some straight man thing.
8111098	8114001	This game rocks, and this is for you, Pixie Dust.
8114541	8116763	Frontal Assault, the ultimate boob game.
8117403	8119425	Okay, this game rocks, okay?
8119505	8120166	It's just awesome.
8122448	8125010	DJ Spector would like to say, fuck you to Max 300.
8126291	8126851	I agree.
8127012	8130715	It's been a while since I've said fuck you to Max 300, but goddamn, the Maxes suck.
8130735	8131395	Get over it.
8132216	8136780	DJ Spector would also like to say, fuck you to my fucking asshole of a Spanish teacher that I have.
8139139	8143963	You know, my Spanish 2 teacher, my least favorite teacher of all... No, my second least favorite teacher of all time.
8144683	8145304	You know what, Rob?
8145444	8145624	What?
8145664	8146424	I never took Spanish.
8148226	8150187	But I took French and Japanese at the same time.
8150367	8151108	¿Cómo te llamas?
8153389	8154010	¡Fuego!
8156612	8158353	El teléfono es el fuego.
8158413	8159214	¡Lucha libre!
8159794	8161075	¿Dónde está el baño?
8161455	8165038	Just like all the words I know in Spanish right there is lucha libre and...
8166224	8176192	LastFU, Telemundo, Wampa164 would like to say, Fuck Halloween for being a shitty holiday that's more of an excuse for people to vandalize people houses and property by teenagers.
8177293	8179134	The end.
8180495	8185619	Pixie Dust also says, I love Loki too, but don't tell Nelly.
8188801	8194766	As Loki brings up the world domination of the boob game that Jamie is watching.
8195379	8196840	What the fuck is this?
8196880	8201882	It's this giant pair of tits that you kind of use your hand to kind of throw.
8205863	8211286	It's kind of like DDR in a way because these little things scroll down the screen and you have to do the steps.
8212246	8213627	You have to do tricks with the boobs.
8213647	8218629	Like you either have to swing them one way or you do like a spiral or you have to just bounce them up and down.
8218969	8220169	It's all very interesting.
8223251	8223651	I swear.
8226286	8229736	Okay, as Jamie is fascinated by the boob game.
8229836	8230960	This game is stupid.
8234699	8236521	I think what we'll do is we'll take another break.
8236961	8237482	Okay.
8238823	8241525	And this break is going to be an LED break.
8242206	8251254	Somebody suggested to me, I forgot who, but I'm sure they'll be happy to hear that we're going to do an LED break because LED is awesome, and we need to hear some more LED songs.
8251314	8254177	So we're going to play some right now for you guys.
8254417	8256198	So enjoy this break, and we'll be back.
8256759	8258801	And we're going to do listless when we come back, yes?
8259562	8259882	Yes.
8260082	8260362	All right.
8260622	8261043	We'll be back.
8282636	8283979	Ranma S and Destroyer
8398857	8400599	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8519189	8520112	Thanks for watching!
8547851	8550155	Chile, Pimson, Nessie
8623078	8623698	Thanks for watching!
8657172	8657894	Thanks for watching!
8705840	8709982	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
8710242	8711923	Are you one of these staffers by Hollywood?
8712003	8712363	No!
8712463	8716065	Do we care what people think of us?
8716705	8718566	No!
8718586	8720006	Do we want people to kiss our ass?
8720487	8722728	Yes!
8724569	8726409	Extreme Bomani Radio.
8726649	8727290	That's us.
8727850	8729371	Orange Lounge Radio.
8730703	8733626	You know what's funny is that promo predates DDR Extreme.
8734687	8735708	That promo?
8736309	8737910	Yes.
8738871	8740533	That was made right before the second show.
8741454	8743316	Because I was gone for the second and third shows.
8744417	8746118	I was in Alabama.
8746259	8752165	I swear to God, when you get back from Alabama before season four premieres, we're going to sit down and do new promos for season four.
8752185	8753546	And that's going to be our treat to everybody.
8753806	8757368	Yeah, well, I'm back the whole Wednesday with nothing going on.
8778501	8783544	I remember somebody said Guardian Legend because Guardian Legend comes up on every list.
8784745	8786326	Something like that.
8787026	8789588	I'm almost positive that was done before, so we decided to shelve it.
8790729	8797033	Instead, we thought we'd go the other way around and say movie they most need to make a game out of.
8797073	8799714	We haven't done listless in a long, long time, so I'm going to explain how this works.
8799734	8801515	This is excluding ones that have already been done, by the way.
8801575	8803476	Yes, excluding ones that have already been done.
8803496	8805938	Or similar, because that took half of mine.
8806229	8807750	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8827168	8851426	and then we're going to have our big list, the definitive list and then we'll go around and the fun part is we each take one off one that we feel is not deserving to be there, it really shouldn't be there so we're going to take one off then the chatroom gets the ultimate say, the chatroom gets to vote on the definitive top three list tonight's topic, movie they most need to make a game out of so, here we go
8852651	8855256	First up, we have... Wait, you want to start, Jamie?
8855276	8855476	Sure.
8855676	8857439	Alright, Jamie, your number four pick for tonight.
8857580	8860365	The number four should be The NeverEnding Story.
8861767	8862629	Make it an RPG.
8863390	8864792	Any reason why NeverEnding Story?
8865514	8865674	Just...
8868911	8870292	Because it would have a kick-ass theme song.
8870612	8871293	Yes, quite.
8871353	8876797	Dear God, I hope... I want the whole... I want a whole... Ring in.
8877117	8878539	Okay, then take that off the list.
8878999	8880380	On PC, PC games don't count.
8880420	8881321	Okay, take it off.
8881641	8882081	Dua.
8882422	8882582	Aw.
8882842	8883242	Labyrinth.
8884363	8886084	I know they had a Labyrinth game on Commodore 64.
8886365	8888646	But that can be one of those really old games that needs to be updated.
8889607	8889887	Okay.
8890088	8890708	All right, Labyrinth.
8892529	8894971	Because then that means rendered David Bowie.
8895071	8895512	Exactly.
8895532	8895992	All right.
8896613	8896873	Okay.
8896893	8896973	Okay.
8898830	8899491	Nobody played it.
8899751	8900992	It was on Commodore 64.
8901072	8901633	Nobody played it.
8902073	8902894	Yeah.
8903034	8903374	Anyways.
8905536	8910120	My pick is going to be... God, there's so many.
8913023	8919328	I'm going to have to go with Showgirls because I can see it now.
8919408	8922090	You're struggling to get to the top of the world.
8922130	8923251	Do whatever it takes.
8923872	8925994	It's a story about survival.
8927404	8928085	I like that idea.
8928105	8934028	That sounds like it would be a really emotional kind of game with a really great backstory.
8934048	8934909	You don't know shit!
8935009	8935909	You don't know shit!
8937110	8939151	One of my very favorite movies of all time.
8939452	8940893	A pick close to my heart, Loki.
8940953	8941373	Thank you.
8943494	8944455	My number four pick...
8945180	8960616	is a game that it actually did have a game back in the 80s and they even updated it somewhat recently but all it was was a newer version of the 80s game and it sucks I want them to just scrap it all and do a new one The Rocky Horror Picture Show Is it a game?
8961055	8963476	They did a game and it sucks ass, so they need a new one.
8963797	8964577	What was this on?
8964777	8966538	It was on Apple 2E.
8967499	8972101	And then they did an updated version of it not too long ago, but it was just an updated version.
8972301	8972801	It sucked.
8973042	8975403	They need to totally just scrap the concept and do a new one.
8975423	8976484	I'm going to give them a do-over.
8976844	8980726	And technically, it's a game based on the play.
8980906	8982627	It's a Rocky Horror show game.
8982987	8986269	So they haven't done the game for the Rocky Horror picture show.
8986609	8987630	So that's my loophole.
8987670	8989931	So it'll be missing a couple of songs there.
8994306	8996147	My number four pick is the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
8996568	8996888	All right.
8997248	8997909	My number three.
8998569	8999510	Number three, Jamie.
8999690	9001832	Is Monty Python and the Holy Grail RPG.
9003733	9009838	Just think of the potential, especially with, who was it that did it, Terry Gilliam?
9010058	9010298	Mm-hmm.
9010739	9012260	Doing all the artwork for it.
9012280	9013641	It'd be awesome.
9013661	9014922	It'd be awesome.
9015002	9015402	I'd love it.
9015682	9018785	And, of course, they need to insert the... The one-on-one with the Black Knight.
9018825	9020106	The Ministry of Coconuts.
9020126	9020486	Mm-hmm.
9020846	9021647	You know, a little snippety.
9021667	9022628	It could be a rhythm game.
9022688	9023909	Proper use of the coconut.
9024824	9026545	They could be a special controller.
9027366	9029908	You'd play as, what was his squire's name, Patsy.
9029928	9030508	Yep.
9031169	9032269	And then you can eat the minstrels.
9032469	9034511	You can eat the minstrels.
9035772	9036933	And that was much rejoicing.
9037113	9037993	Yay.
9038454	9039755	Loki, your number three pick.
9040315	9043057	A newer one that just came to my head right now.
9044778	9046439	Orgasmo, the video game.
9047800	9048221	Orgasmo.
9049542	9050942	Pink Flamingo's The Game
9080191	9082852	Pink Flamingos is a John Waters early movie.
9082892	9084953	It's one of the most disgusting films ever made.
9084993	9086353	And it's about two people.
9086873	9091114	I should say three people because there's a couple and Divine, of course, in one of her best roles ever.
9091415	9094575	They're in a competition to be the filthiest person in the world.
9094996	9099357	And imagine if you could participate in that competition to be the filthiest person in the world.
9099617	9101878	And at the end, like the last stage, you can eat dog shit.
9102978	9105159	I just had an odd thought.
9105439	9105619	What?
9107333	9110154	They've made, created a machine that merges two people into one.
9111014	9112975	And so they take John Waters and John Hughes.
9115396	9115736	Imagine!
9115756	9117016	Then you just get hairspray.
9117616	9118657	Oh, yeah.
9118997	9119637	Alright, anyway.
9120177	9121378	Your number three pick, Jamie.
9121398	9121938	My number three pick.
9121958	9122678	I'm sorry, your number two pick.
9122698	9124039	My number two pick is Kill Bill.
9125679	9129400	Having to go through your enemies, and then all the fight scenes play like Bushido Blade.
9129500	9130801	God damn you, that was my number one.
9132418	9134899	You better not take my number one or I'll kick your ass.
9134999	9135360	All right.
9136120	9137220	You know what my number one is.
9138261	9138721	I can guess.
9138821	9139161	Loki.
9141343	9142583	Oh, this one should be easy.
9144624	9147626	The Oral Adventures of Kraven Moorhead.
9149347	9152528	What?
9152768	9153989	Please explain.
9154449	9157891	I can see this one playing out like Commander Keen or something like that.
9160285	9162066	It's a porno movie, folks!
9162706	9165367	But hey, it's got 17 videos already.
9165767	9169468	With a movie, you know, with a franchise that large, it needs a game.
9172129	9174190	I mean, alright, alright, fair enough.
9175550	9182052	My number two pick... Right... My number two pick is a movie you probably have never seen, but I'll explain it for you.
9182192	9184513	It's Trick, the game.
9186920	9194344	Trick is a nice little piece of gay cinema that's about two guys that just run into each other on the subway that are trying desperately to find a place to fuck.
9195444	9197445	And I'm thinking this will make an exciting video game.
9198086	9199527	It could be like one of those stealth games.
9199707	9200647	Have you ever played Thief?
9201387	9202008	That could be it.
9202068	9205369	It could be like, we've got to find a place to screw right now.
9205390	9206970	And there's a time limit and everything.
9207551	9208091	Trick the game.
9208131	9210792	And it could even have a cameo from Tori Spelling, just like the movie did.
9210812	9211453	It would be beautiful.
9211893	9213854	So Trick the Game is my number two pick.
9215195	9215995	My number one.
9216536	9217697	Yes, you're number one, Jamie.
9217717	9225166	Now, I was thinking of Scanners, but then again, there was Galarians, where you have people thinking at people hard enough that it makes their heads explode.
9225927	9226608	They already did that.
9227469	9228390	And all kinds of others.
9228811	9233657	But I figured, in keeping with, because it's me, we'd have Battle Royale.
9234057	9234397	Of course.
9235814	9241519	And it would work and make it like you have survival horror mode or you have multiplayer mode.
9242080	9246784	And then your friends, if you've got Xbox, put it on Xbox, network those bad boys.
9247025	9248746	You could have the whole classroom.
9249947	9250748	Who would win?
9251649	9252209	Think about it.
9252550	9252950	Excellent.
9253371	9253751	Catch.
9254969	9259550	All right, Loki, your number one pick for a movie that most needs to be a game.
9260410	9266891	No one except for maybe the people in the studio have actually seen this movie since it's that awful.
9267272	9271232	But it needs a game, and I will put the picture up on the cam.
9272093	9274793	It is Cheerleader Ninjas, the movie.
9274893	9275933	Cheerleader Ninjas.
9276653	9278334	I would love to see a game for this.
9283595	9283955	Awesome.
9285977	9289582	Can you briefly explain what this movie is about for those that may not have seen it?
9290103	9295110	It's about these cheerleaders who are being blamed for smut on the internet.
9295490	9297193	And they have to fight these nuns.
9297853	9300497	And there's this gay guy who's like the head, you know...
9301398	9302499	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9322332	9324714	I'm not sure if this movie had a game.
9324994	9327776	Jamie took my number one, so I'm having a stretch here.
9328236	9330178	But I'm thinking the more I think about it, this would be an awesome game.
9330198	9331018	It may have already had one.
9331058	9331539	I don't know, though.
9331759	9333260	Did Starship Troopers have a game?
9333320	9333480	Yes.
9333680	9334221	Damn it.
9336042	9337864	It was a 3D first-person shooter game.
9338284	9339125	Damn it, damn it, damn it.
9339785	9340185	I got one.
9340546	9343068	You can do Contact, the game.
9343228	9343448	No.
9343468	9346590	You play through the whole game and you find out that the boss is just her dad.
9346650	9346771	No.
9349491	9350091	Fuck that.
9350331	9351432	No contact the game.
9351472	9352172	I don't want that shit.
9352192	9352792	Geely the game.
9353152	9354213	You struggle.
9354233	9354273	No.
9354933	9356314	No Geely the game either.
9356634	9357994	I need more ideas.
9358214	9363656	I think I'm liking the idea of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back the game.
9363796	9365277	I was going to say that.
9365577	9366737	Or better yet, Clerks.
9366977	9367658	Let's do Clerks.
9367918	9368598	Clerks the game.
9368618	9369338	That was on my list.
9369558	9370319	That was on my list.
9370339	9372319	We're going to do Clerks the game.
9372539	9374740	I'm not even supposed to be in this game.
9374800	9376421	I'm not even supposed to play this today.
9377583	9378584	That could be the tagline.
9378624	9379304	It could be beautiful.
9379425	9382547	Or it could be like a sports game, Clerks Rooftop Hockey.
9382687	9383027	Yes.
9383568	9384749	It's a collection of minigames.
9386270	9388191	But you can get the alternate ending.
9389532	9391454	Ah.
9391594	9392375	Where everyone dies.
9394116	9395037	Wasn't that what happened?
9395477	9396338	Oh, he just got shot.
9397218	9398039	The original ending.
9398139	9398439	All right.
9398800	9399620	So here we are.
9399720	9401001	This is the list we have so far.
9401062	9402743	Next up is the elimination round.
9403203	9404064	We have Labyrinth.
9404793	9420800	Showgirls, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Orgasmo, Pink Flamingos, Kill Bill, The Oral Adventures of Kraven Moorhead, Trick, Battle Royale, Cheerleader Ninjas, and Clerks.
9421480	9423321	Jamie, what has to come off this list?
9429375	9429855	Showgirls.
9431597	9434599	I'm sorry, but I don't see how that could be made into a game.
9434959	9435639	Jamie.
9435659	9437300	You're killing me.
9437561	9440363	Unless it played like the Spice Girls game, which sucks.
9440383	9441363	You're killing me, Jamie.
9441623	9443285	It could be a dance game.
9443345	9445606	They would never be able to do it justice.
9447087	9447567	You're right.
9447608	9448008	You're right.
9448028	9449449	They could never do it justice.
9449889	9450429	You're right.
9450509	9450850	Thank you.
9451130	9452571	I'm okay with that pick now, Jamie.
9452631	9453532	Okay.
9453772	9455413	Loki, your turn to take something off the list.
9456153	9457434	Here comes Loki.
9457534	9458275	Here comes Loki.
9460197	9460958	A glass of something.
9461018	9461479	Is that blood?
9463401	9466225	Yes, the blood of all fruit.
9468228	9469790	It's tropical punch blood.
9469810	9473735	Okay, anyways.
9473755	9474797	Loki, what's coming off the list?
9476052	9490682	Pink Flamingos Ew, bitch That's gone I like the idea of Trick as a survival horror game Or like a stealth game Pink Flamingos, I can't see that Alright, you bastard You know what?
9491242	9504291	I'm sorry, but The Oral Adventures of Kraven Moorhead It's way too obscure I'm letting Cheerleader Ninjas slip by, for God's sake Cheerleader Ninjas would own The Oral Adventures of Kraven Moorhead is just a little too out there
9504961	9507203	It's a little too out there, so I'm going to have to take that off.
9507563	9508964	Okay, so here's what's left, you guys.
9509304	9509905	I get to read it.
9510005	9510685	You get to read it.
9510885	9511926	I get to post it first.
9512026	9514007	And when I post it, you guys can send your vote.
9514047	9518430	You're only going to vote for your favorite, and we will somehow come up with a top three out of this.
9518651	9520752	So if you wouldn't mind, Jamie, take it away.
9521252	9523734	Labyrinth, Rocky Horror Picture Show.
9523834	9525876	Maybe tell us a little bit about each movie that you know.
9525916	9526816	I'll fill in if you don't know.
9527156	9530619	Labyrinth is David Bowie in tight spandex.
9532705	9534986	Oh yeah, and some chick asked to rescue her little brother anyway.
9536987	9539088	Who was it that played her?

9539769	9540569	Yeah, Jennifer Connelly.
9543371	9549434	I hope, just sorry to interrupt, but I hope Zex and Chad is listening because there is nothing better in this world than Labyrinth for him.
9551015	9553956	Labyrinth is, okay, I picked up the Superbit edition.
9554196	9558759	I think he would come, if he's listening, I know he's going to come in the chat room for once just to vote for that.
9559534	9560895	Well, I hope he cleans up after himself.
9561855	9564117	Um, next up, Rocky Horror Picture Show.

9633826	9636789	It's about two gay guys who are trying to find a place to screw.
9637209	9638450	I was making it up.
9638670	9639711	Oh, okay.

9701100	9703282	The definitive list, coming back when we come back.
9773195	9774077	Thanks for watching!
9861196	9862377	Thanks for watching!
9928649	9928972	and more.
9982562	9982957	Thanks for watching!
10012864	10017807	From StepSquad to OrangeLabs, this DDR sucks!
10017887	10019788	Holla, Holla, Holla!
10019808	10019908	GGPO!
10032068	10034089	Hello, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
10034249	10043415	I know the suspense is killing you, but here it is, the definitive list as decided by us, Loki, DarkSakura, and Skye.
10043955	10045036	And a little help from the chat room.
10047537	10050499	www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.
10050559	10051279	Alright, here it is.
10052860	10057863	The top three movies you would like to see made into a game.
10058643	10061205	Number three, Kill Bill.
10062530	10068216	A lot of people when they were voting said, you know, I was going to vote for Kill Bill, but I think they're going to make that into a game anyway.
10068497	10069578	You guys are probably right.
10069638	10074423	I would say on this entire list, Kill Bill is the one I think is most likely going to be a game, if anything.
10074443	10074824	We'll see.
10075204	10078568	But Tarantino is such a big nerd that I could see it happening.
10079008	10080650	But Kill Bill is your number three pick.
10080970	10084094	But there were two films on this list you want to see even more than Kill Bill.
10084895	10087900	and number two is Clerks.
10088621	10089703	Clerks the game.
10090425	10097738	Yep, so you guys want to just be lazy in your video games as well as your real life, I guess, because there wouldn't be a lot to do in Clerks the game.
10099117	10100639	The animated series will be fun, I think.
10100799	10102560	So there it is, Clerks the Game.
10103081	10108506	And your number one pick, I think this is pretty much a no-brainer, you guys, Battle Royale the Game.
10109867	10112670	Best, I mean, this could be a Doom killer right here.
10112690	10115972	Fuck Quake, fuck Doom, Battle Royale would be where it's at.
10118575	10120176	I don't know, somebody should make a Quake mod.
10120356	10125241	I talked to someone who was actually trying to do one in Counter-Strike, but of course it wasn't really going to work.
10126892	10127452	Well, there you go.
10127532	10130053	The list has decided by you and us.
10130433	10131373	There's no disputing it.
10131473	10131993	That is it.
10132093	10135194	That's the list of movies that most need to be a game.
10136654	10147016	Okay, so now that we're back, Loki, we haven't even really referenced this yet in the show, but Loki would like to share with you this new game he downloaded this week.
10147956	10149657	And, Loki, you want to tell us a little more about this?
10150497	10151917	Yeah.
10151937	10155318	First off, the chair is being attacked by the microphone cords again.
10157324	10159005	Maybe that should be a movie or a game.
10159345	10160566	Attack of the Killer Microphone Court.
10165888	10166488	You okay there?
10166728	10167289	Need some help?
10168129	10168609	You gonna make it?
10171671	10174392	You're just in the middle of traffic, I think, is what happens to it.
10174792	10175993	I was the one sitting in it.
10176053	10176833	I didn't do anything.
10176953	10178754	She was spinning around and around and around.
10182836	10183096	Okay.
10183496	10184277	You okay, Loki?
10184497	10184937	You gonna make it?
10185529	10186810	Are you going to be okay?
10186830	10187611	Alright, he's ready.
10187731	10189593	He's ready to tell you all about the game.
10190634	10191234	I am safe.
10191875	10194577	Okay.
10194617	10198661	This game is this company's answer to DDR.
10198701	10203325	Yes, this game will take the world by storm and you will never know what DDR is.
10203345	10205166	You'll just go, oh my god, this game rocks.
10206387	10207849	At least that's what they would like to think.
10208689	10210351	This game is called Tap-A-Jam.
10211712	10212633	Tap-A-Jam.
10214059	10217461	and Tapajam is, well, it's interesting.
10221143	10222404	Tapajam loading.
10222944	10226706	And what wonderful songs can you expect in Tapajam?
10227306	10228027	Well, let's see.
10228247	10229488	It's all public domain music.
10229588	10237332	So, we have wonderful songs like Cannon and Bee, Flight of the Bumblebee,
10239824	10242144	Wow, these are top quality songs, you guys.
10242685	10243605	Moonlight Sonata.
10245925	10246665	Blue Danube.
10247966	10248406	Danube.
10250386	10252306	Simon Says Disco Fingers.
10252887	10253647	Who knows what that is?
10256087	10256907	And more shit.
10257908	10258528	Oh, and Chopsticks.
10258888	10259648	Yes, Chopsticks.
10261068	10264549	And you can see Loki and I are so mature when we play at our high score table.
10267419	10270261	Ass is in first place and cunts in second place.
10271381	10272542	Because we're so mature.
10273703	10273943	Okay.
10273963	10275124	So now we're going to show the game here.
10275144	10278226	We'll get Jamie's reaction.
10278426	10279666	And I'll describe it for our listeners.
10280007	10284809	Basically... Oh, man, you changed the... Oh, I changed the controls.
10284909	10285510	Sorry, guys.
10287211	10287291	Ah.
10288658	10294119	Basically, you have this up, down, left, right arrow, but it's on the left side of the screen.
10294419	10297860	So we've had, you know, we've had DDRs at the top, Beat Manias at the bottom.
10298080	10300960	Well, now we have a game where it's on the left side of the screen.
10301480	10303861	And so you have the up, left, right, and down arrows.
10305101	10305761	It's left, Loki.
10306181	10306681	That one's left.
10308021	10308721	And then right and down.
10310062	10317203	And as the notes scroll over to the left, you have to hit them when they come in this column, is the way this works.
10319241	10320281	Okay, what happened to my mouse?
10320482	10320842	There it goes.
10322723	10323283	Okie dokie.
10323543	10325584	And what website can they download this from, Loki?
10327025	10328505	It's that, like, game... If they would really want to?
10328525	10333048	It's like a game house is what's at... Just do a search for Tapa Jam.
10333768	10337189	It's like... Oh my god, beatbox bonus feature!
10337330	10338410	I didn't see this before!
10338450	10339951	Oh, a beatbox bonus feature, huh?
10341532	10343412	Oh, it's... Just go to the game.
10345013	10346414	It's like a music generator, just gay.
10352393	10354595	Alright, so he's going to play this.
10357818	10360501	And it even has a little wavelength in the bottom of the screen.
10360561	10363283	So it's like instead of pretty videos, you get waves like Winamp.
10365045	10366986	Listen to Loki make that sweet music.
10367006	10371951	Okay.
10380422	10381223	Aren't you happy?
10381303	10388829	Doesn't this game make you just go in that base?
10389069	10390310	I feel like breaking down.
10390370	10390931	Come on.
10392512	10393233	Jamie, your thoughts?
10400999	10403121	This is shit.
10404642	10405643	Actually, combo.
10405703	10406364	Oh my god.
10414248	10417750	I think this is an interesting way to get around having to license any song.
10418070	10420071	They just put in a bunch of classical songs.
10422032	10422873	That's a pretty smart idea.
10422893	10424694	Hey, we like our classical songs, don't we?
10425294	10430037	But I think we like our classical songs better when the renditions don't suck ass.
10431545	10436828	when they're played by an orchestra and not some $2 Casio keyboard from Walmart.
10443151	10447934	So if you've ever wanted to play Beatmania in the comfort of your own home, go buy a Beatmania machine.
10447954	10449274	Do not settle for this shit.
10451195	10453196	This is sort of like a guitar freak show.
10454137	10455958	Oh, Loki failed Chopsticks!
10456716	10461699	It's because I'm running the camera software, it's like, the notes are on one side of the screen, and I was like, jump.
10461919	10465762	If you thought Night Style had bad lag, try playing Tapper Jam with the camera.
10467963	10470004	But anyways, yeah, this game sucks.
10470625	10471525	But isn't this interesting?
10471545	10474187	This ties into what we were talking about last week.
10474227	10480451	We were talking about, you know, oh, this Into the Groove thing is going to get its pantsuit off it because it's copying Konami.
10481064	10485208	Well shit, this is a blatant ripoff of Beatmania if I've ever seen one.
10485568	10489612	I mean, they've differed it enough, but it's still, it's shit.
10490593	10491954	It's not even a good ripoff.
10492955	10494096	This sounds like shit.
10494116	10496198	Stop broadcasting this shit on the radio.
10497039	10498881	We have little enough listeners as it is.
10499721	10500102	Alright, fine.
10502659	10504540	Oh, I only get seven more sessions.
10505320	10506421	They only limit me to ten.
10506561	10508222	I think I'm going to go be violent.
10508282	10509823	Oh, it's at GameHouse.com.
10509843	10510863	That's where you can find it at.
10511964	10513204	And what other games do they have?
10513764	10515825	Somebody posted a link in our chat room.
10515865	10517046	Tiger posted that for you guys.
10518207	10518927	Yeah, lame.
10526220	10537103	This is what happens when people start making... This is what, if they have problems licensing music, if we're into the groove, this is what it's going to be like.
10537123	10543944	Yeah, we're going to have MIDI-sounding classical pieces, and we'll get to dance to Chopsticks and the Big Anub.
10544144	10546105	Play the one song real quick that I... What song?
10546465	10547265	This is Utopia.
10547305	10549226	This is one of the songs that's going to be into the group.
10549446	10550127	Sure, go for it.
10550207	10552668	And I didn't really like it that much, but, you know.
10552708	10554769	All right, we'll let our listeners judge for themselves.
10555209	10558370	This is by Ka, which is Gil's new name, if I'm not mistaken.
10558791	10561512	And Smiley is the name that he's under for this one.
10561532	10562912	You know, he's doing the Naoki thing.
10563113	10563613	How cute.
10564053	10565494	And, well, here it is.
10565574	10566574	All right, judge for yourself.
10566614	10567935	Here's Utopia from into the group.
10569495	10570756	I always think of the Madonna song.
10570816	10572297	Okay, come on.
10573017	10574978	I can't get away from being Madonna-ish.
10696519	10701120	Wow, okay, that was Utopia by Ka, Smiley, Keel, whatever the name is.
10701260	10703581	It's a song that's going to be an into the groove.
10704841	10705701	You guys' thoughts?
10705801	10709262	Loki, I know you already said you didn't like it, so I thought we'd see Jamie's thoughts.
10710022	10714503	Jamie's curled up in a little ball going to sleep, so you don't think you'd want to dance to that one, Jamie?
10716684	10717724	No, not much.
10720848	10723371	I think you guys are being a little hard on it.
10723411	10724573	I think it's a good song.
10724753	10727957	The problem is, okay, it's a good song, but...
10728619	10730560	It's badly produced.
10731960	10738023	And I'm not blaming the author for this because I think he's very talented and he's writing good music.
10738343	10743985	I think he's just probably very limited in what he's able to write because he probably only has so much equipment, you know, whatever.
10744305	10749607	But I think with an actual recording studio, if this guy worked for Konami, I think the song would be sweet.
10749927	10752248	I think it would have the better sampling.
10752488	10756830	I think you were exactly right when you said it sounds like a MIDI.
10757410	10760113	I think the sampling he's using is not good.
10760454	10761635	It's kind of a poor choice.
10761675	10764318	The piano sounds a little too MIDI-ish to me.
10765339	10768102	I think if he had the right equipment, it would be a kick-ass song.
10768122	10770764	I think if it were better produced, basically, is what it is.
10770804	10772266	I think it's a good song, badly produced.
10774002	10775983	I just don't think that it suits a dancing game.
10776063	10778443	It just doesn't seem like something I would enjoy playing.
10779404	10780004	It's a good song.
10780344	10781604	I just don't think I'd enjoy playing it.
10782745	10785845	It's actually, I almost see it more as like a 2DX song, in a way.
10786165	10792287	I think if it were more... It's funny you should mention that, because it's like a 12-footer in this damn game, so the steps are like 2DX.
10792307	10793728	You know what?
10793768	10798369	See, that's just going to ruin the song even more, to throw it away on these 12-footers and stuff.
10799129	10801870	I mean, that's just... It's stupid.
10803991	10805051	There's no need for it.
10805111	10805691	Come on.
10807052	10810793	Why don't you have a couple 11-footers to kill people?
10810853	10812093	But stick to fun steps.
10812113	10813573	That song could have some fun steps.
10813613	10814994	I think that song could have some really fun steps.
10815014	10822935	What they were saying is they have a maniac level or whatever, and already 10 of the songs have 11 and 12-footer steps.
10823055	10829217	I think the problem is people think that the way they can squeeze more life out of DDR is to make it harder.
10829992	10832914	And it's just kind of like, you know what, the human body is going to reach a point.
10833135	10835877	And there's a point where it's just not going to be fun for the rest of us anymore.
10835917	10841581	You're making the game to satisfy the 1% of people who could pass Max Period on the first try.
10842042	10847226	I'm sorry, but in my eyes, Max Period is no fun at all.
10848367	10850969	It's a bad DDR song because it's no fun at all.
10851329	10854952	Speeding a song up to 600 beats per minute at the end, that's stupid.
10856293	10858174	It's inhuman and undoable.
10858635	10859015	It's just...
10860967	10861348	It's too bad.
10862289	10864151	And the song sucks.
10864211	10865012	That's a big factor.
10866454	10868537	If they're going to do hard ones, the song at least needs to be good.
10872382	10872642	Okay.
10873463	10876367	Well, any other thoughts on this?
10879969	10885492	Any other thoughts on Into the Groove, Tapajam, any other DDR knockoffs we need to address while we're here?
10887874	10889575	I'm just thinking that we can do it way better.
10889935	10894338	And like I said, I'm going to take my attempt at it, so we'll work on it.
10894518	10900802	As I said last week, I'm going to try pushing that and seeing if an arcade will take my idea.
10900962	10905585	I'm just saying, you could do it a lot better than what you're doing right now.
10906773	10907113	Whatever.
10907774	10908234	But that's fine.
10909515	10916421	I mean, I understand that they have their, you know, limitations with going the legal route, but, you know, a lot of people don't care about the legal route.
10916441	10920844	That's why the DVR machines are here, so... That's the way you gotta look at it.
10924227	10929592	Joe Mama wanted to make a point, kind of defending Max's period a little bit, I guess, or whatever, playing Devil's Advocate.
10929973	10935398	How many people play Max 300 on 2-speed, he says, because that's just as bad as 600 beats per minute.
10936119	10938401	Honestly, I've seen one or two.
10938622	10940864	I've not seen that many people that brave it on 2-speed.
10940984	10943767	I mean, some people do it for the challenge.
10944407	10948689	But I don't really see it as something practical.
10949129	10951770	Most people that do it on 2-speed honestly haven't memorized.
10951810	10952770	They've played it so goddamn hard.
10952790	10955531	Here's the thing is, people don't like BPM-doubled songs.
10955991	10960352	Songs that, you know, the steps are going quite... Yeah, because honestly, max 300 is only supposed to be 150 beats per minute.
10960673	10962933	Yeah, I mean, we understand that, and same with Dropout.
10962993	10972977	Dropout's the same way, and I understand they go with the bass line on it, and they do, you know, the bass line goes in eighth notes or whatever for max period, not one point, and that's why it goes 600.
10974017	10979584	But the only reason, the steps for Max period aren't that hard, it's just so hard to read.
10979784	10980565	It's just stupid.
10981486	10984289	And the steps in the beginning are stupid too, because it's just jumping.
10984690	10985631	It's tons of jumping.
10986625	10987325	No one likes that.
10987405	10988126	It's just retarded.
10988286	10988826	That's true.
10989286	10993048	A lot of stepfiles in Tournament XIV got reamed for that.
10993648	10993868	Right?
10993988	10995989	Too many weird jokes and stuff.
10996089	10998510	If that were a stepfile in Tournament XIV, they would be bitching.
10998530	11002272	It wouldn't have even made it into the final.
11002332	11006593	It would just be laughed off as, like, first off, being a horrible Max remix.
11007194	11011175	And two, they would have been like, oh, well, this is the stepfile for it.
11011195	11011576	It's stupid.
11011596	11013676	Why did you double the BPM at the very end?
11013716	11014597	That's retarded.
11015297	11016517	They would have laughed at that thing.
11016938	11020498	I don't even know why they did that.
11021539	11024740	I don't really think they know what they're doing as far as sim files go.
11025160	11027160	I don't think they know what they're doing.
11027200	11030201	I don't think they know what their customers want.
11030901	11039384	And so they're looking at sim files, unfortunately looking at really shitty ones, and they're like, well, people like this, so this is what they're doing.
11039744	11040944	It just doesn't make any sense.
11043536	11049638	Okay, I guess at this point now, we'll open it up for final thoughts of the evening, because that's about it.
11049718	11059402	Actually, I did want to say though, Jamie, have a safe trip, fly safe, have fun in Alabama, have twice as much fun for me, three times as much, see, Loki's covered too, because California's going to suck.
11061149	11063010	I know, it'll suck until I get back.
11064250	11065991	Now, I'll have a good time.
11066231	11067552	You know, I'm going to see my family.
11068052	11071654	Hope they don't drive me completely insane by the time I get back.
11072494	11076416	But, and I'm going to have, I'm going to have Ma and Chad with me.
11077837	11080738	So, flying sort of parallel flights.
11081719	11084020	So, we're going to have lots of hanging out time.
11086061	11087822	So, it's a girls trip out to Alabama.
11087842	11088382	That should be fun.
11089085	11090426	All right, final thoughts of the evening.
11090926	11094427	I was just thinking, kind of a question to pose to the chat room.
11094447	11094647	Sure.
11096308	11107873	If you were to, like, say, go to your normal arcade, you've got, like, you know, your DVR Extreme has been there forever, and say it was upgraded with something that was homemade, but not necessarily, like, you know, into the group where it's its own things.
11108013	11113716	Like, say someone put Step Mania on there and put, like, a bunch of, like, you know, the old tracks and some of the new tracks.
11114176	11118979	Would you be that, like, against it if it was, like, a pretty decent collection of songs?
11119579	11124902	Are you going to be all pissed off that it's just, you know, it's an independent software and not an official Konami thing?
11125102	11128264	Or are you just going to be like, you know, hey, this is cool?
11128884	11130846	Because that's what I'm getting at.
11130966	11136549	I'm just trying to see if people would be so pissed off at having, like, a well put together set of songs.
11137350	11138492	But not official.
11138832	11140895	I mean, because this is into the group stuff.
11140935	11145540	If it was a well put together set of songs, it might be alright, but I don't know.
11146181	11149345	Just a little question to throw around there and discuss.
11150406	11150947	Alright, well.
11151539	11156044	Let's go around and get final thoughts, and we'll see if there's any answers to that when we get back.
11156124	11158106	Somebody wanted to share their final thought with us.
11158787	11168697	Somebody who's going by the nickname of Skywhore, thank you, thanks, that's great, says their final thought is that 2DX has met its match with Tapajam.
11170118	11171420	Have another bud, buddy.
11174352	11176134	A. You're my whore for Christ's sake.
11177515	11179336	B. No.
11179676	11187202	2DX has met its match with the... I would love to see a mix of songs, like to do just kind of like an independent thing.
11187542	11190765	Have the artists from 2DX and have like some of the homebrew artists.
11193246	11198889	Have some of the homebrew artists fight against each other, like kind of a DJ battle type thing.
11198909	11204152	Because there's a lot of homebrew artists out there that make really kick-ass songs and animations that go with them.
11205292	11207493	All right.
11207814	11212096	Well, I'm looking to see in the chat room if there's any response to your hypothetical question to them, and there is not.
11212496	11213136	Nobody cares.
11213336	11214957	So I guess it's time to end the show.
11215597	11216418	Loki, your final thought?
11217644	11224007	My final thought is I better get working on my show this week so I don't have to do it the same day as I usually do.
11224128	11224808	Tune in what day?
11225288	11225808	Wednesday.
11225969	11226389	What time?
11226949	11227609	It'll be at 7.
11228830	11229350	Sounds good.
11229750	11230591	Jamie, your final thought?
11234589	11237610	I have to get up at 4 in the fucking morning.
11238431	11239751	Oh, I'm sorry, final thought.
11241032	11248495	Don't forget, my show's going to be on Monday, and Tuesday I'm going to be on a plane, so just hope that I don't die or something.
11249176	11249716	And that's it.
11251377	11252938	I don't miss you all!
11254218	11259361	Um, my final thought is, um, I have nothing more to say.
11259921	11260301	That's it.
11263720	11268723	Jamie, you're going to have to word tonight because I know you enjoy always getting the word and you're going to be gone for a couple weeks, so here you go.
11270784	11271504	Here we go.
11273606	11276007	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
11276467	11280349	Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
11280750	11282591	We expect you a nice play again.
11283091	11285852	And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
11286413	11289715	Well, I object to all this sex on the television.
11290135	11292036	I mean, I keep falling off.
11292816	11294917	thanks for listening and we'll see you next week
11328095	11336580	Orange Lounge Radio, The Afterbirth, the part after the credits have crawled across the screen, and everything you think has come to an end, but it's still going.
11337380	11340622	Loki, you did finally get some feedback to your hypothetical situation you posed.
11340922	11341982	Okay.
11342703	11347725	I think, Zodiac Knight says, I think the potential for any DDR homebrew lies in the song selection.
11348546	11348786	Okay.
11349566	11349967	Sounds good.
11352588	11355009	Zodiac Knight also says, I would take a look at it at least.
11355810	11356310	Give it a try.
11357153	11374902	The thing I'm concerned about is I want to do this, and I think we might have the potential to actually put it in the arcade, but I'm thinking people are going to go and see it, and they're going to go on DDR free and go, oh my god, I saw this in the arcade, and people are getting pissed off, and I'm bitching about that.
11375522	11380305	It's kind of ironic that the people that like the game so much would actually ruin it for themselves.
11382206	11384127	Interesting thought.
11384407	11388169	Pixie Dust says, I suck at DDR, but I'd still try it.
11389509	11389730	Okay.
11390330	11394112	Because, like I said... So I think everybody's kind of like, okay, I'll try it.
11394552	11395232	I'll try it once.
11395613	11397053	I'll try it once, twice if I like it.
11398174	11398814	Three times to be sure.
11399135	11400535	Three times to be sure, exactly.
11400896	11401116	Okay.
11401216	11404257	Well, if they had good music, then I suppose it would take off and work.
11404377	11405818	So that's what I'll have to work on.
11405838	11407939	I'll have to work on it.
11407979	11409440	You should use my evil edits.
11409981	11413342	Nostylan says he's going to miss you, Jamie.
11413923	11416144	And he's going to miss Pump Up the Volume as well.
11416644	11417765	Well, it'll still be playing.
11417785	11418865	You'll get to hear some of the old ones.
11419586	11426890	And, you know, maybe the Tuesday night I get back, if I'm not, like, dead to the world, I'll toss on some Eurobeat for you.
11428174	11430355	I have a couple things I was going to be planning.
11431916	11434117	LiveWire for the 19th of November.
11434137	11436058	I'm going to have to do something special for that.
11437059	11438380	Some Bomani-related thing.
11439240	11442802	And then, what was it?
11444123	11448945	Also, I think, I don't know, might try to do something special for New Year's.
11449206	11450846	I don't know, depending on what I'm doing.
11452687	11453988	We should do something on New Year's.
11454348	11455269	What day is New Year's?
11456170	11458272	I do something every New Year's though.
11458792	11463135	Yeah, I'm thinking if anything runs on New Year's it's going to be taped because I don't want to be here.
11463475	11466697	We always do an anime marathon and get really drunk.
11466958	11472141	Yeah, I'm thinking I want to go out and get wasted because I didn't get to do it for Halloween so I'm going to be doing it for New Year's.
11473822	11475283	You can come get wasted with me, Loki.
11476144	11476644	Come on.
11477245	11478766	Drunk Rob is awesome, isn't it?
11480067	11484470	Drunk Rob is funny, Mr. Piñata.
11486303	11489006	I got called by somebody drunk last night three times.
11489186	11493089	I won't embarrass them on the air by saying who it is, but it was really funny.
11494270	11494851	It was great.
11494971	11496492	And he called today to apologize.
11496572	11497633	I'm like, you don't have to apologize.
11497653	11498114	You're funny.
11498734	11499195	This is cool.
11500676	11501657	So, it was funny.
11502918	11503799	Drunk people are hilarious.
11504740	11505361	You know what?
11505601	11505821	What?
11508784	11510085	You've seen me get drunk.
11510816	11514177	But I don't think I'm funny when I'm drunk, because it doesn't last.
11514237	11515717	You've been funny when you're drunk.
11516658	11519098	How?
11519618	11521279	I've seen you be funny when you're drunk.
11522059	11525220	I go around giving other people drinks because I want them to be as drunk as me.
11526080	11530361	People are calling on the phone, not realizing we're trying to do a show in this house.
11533242	11537003	Yeah, he's doing a radio show.
11538824	11540244	Who's the goober that called?
11541963	11543366	Yeah, I can have him call you.
11544768	11545409	Alright, bye.
11546771	11548374	Who was the goober that called?
11548494	11550278	That was Matt, so you can yell at him.
11550318	11550818	Goober!
11550839	11552682	Oh, you're still doing that?
11553163	11554305	Yeah, we are.
11555200	11555801	www.DarkSakura.com
11575978	11579400	But the way we've been counting, 69 is coming up in a couple weeks.
11579420	11580381	Those were half episodes.
11580541	11581841	Yeah.
11582162	11583402	It's so weird, you guys.
11584783	11586684	I can remember back to the first episode.
11586904	11589405	When we hit 100, we need to be really, really quick.
11589425	11591367	Well, I already said when we hit 100, I'm quitting.
11591687	11593228	No, we're not going to quit.
11593948	11595229	We're going to keep going.
11595749	11596669	All right, we'll keep going.
11596749	11599371	We're going to be geriatric.
11599411	11600832	PC Dust wants to take me to L.A.
11600892	11602392	for New Year's.
11602453	11603133	I'm down with that.
11604577	11607000	I want to go far away for New Year's.
11607140	11607821	I want to travel.
11608081	11609303	I want to have money and travel.
11609363	11610084	That's what I'm going to do.
11610204	11613007	Yeah, but I want a cookie, but I can't have that.
11615603	11615923	All right.
11616604	11622106	Your post-show tonight is going to be a recycled pre-show, one of Jamie's old pre-shows, and it's one I like.
11622887	11624968	So I've decided that that's going to be tonight's post-show.
11624988	11626309	Oh, and which one, pray tell.
11626509	11628950	It is the one with all the Svensson and Ghislaine mixes.
11629310	11630131	Oh, that one was fun.
11630391	11630911	Yes, it was.
11631491	11634373	Oh, wait, now I'm curious.
11634413	11638715	Now, before I get into the post-show, somebody says, Joe Mama says, the first episodes were fun.
11640556	11642157	Did we jump the shark or something?
11642197	11643898	What's wrong with the recent episodes?
11644810	11649373	I think this is like a fine wine we've improved with age.
11650293	11653415	I don't know, I've been noticing that... Or like a mold's gotten bigger.
11653595	11654956	I've been less bitter lately.
11654976	11659819	It's just like, I get to Sunday and I'm already relaxed.
11659839	11663781	I'll be angry all throughout the week and then I just kind of calm down on the weekend.
11664782	11669424	It's not because I'm getting laid more or anything, it's just because... I don't know, it's just calming.
11669785	11672026	I'm the only one not getting laid, I should be the bitter one.
11673288	11678150	But even when I wasn't, I was, I mean, even when I was, I was still getting, I was still bitter.
11678250	11683752	It's just like, I think I don't go out enough and get, like, people pissing me off enough.
11683812	11687013	Or it's the same people pissing me off, so it's like, eh, been there.
11687893	11691395	So, has Orange Lounge Radio jumped the shark yet, you think?
11691435	11692895	Or you think we still got a ways to go?
11692955	11697397	No, but I'm very scared to think of 23 Magus with a man's slut.
11698988	11699588	Well now.
11701549	11702230	Oh, I see.
11702270	11706872	Joe Mama is thinking back to those days when only like six people frequented our chat room during the shows.
11707012	11709233	And we just didn't give a fuck.
11709273	11709834	And guess what?
11709874	11712495	You still don't give a fuck.
11712855	11716217	Yeah, I mean, the number of people has never been that important to us.
11716317	11722900	I mean, because obviously if we were numbers, we don't get that many people in retrospect to listen to the show.
11722940	11724441	But in internet radio terms...
11725245	11726506	Quite a few, actually.
11726947	11730950	Quite a few for an internet radio show, which is very good.
11730970	11731570	We are loved.
11732391	11733532	And we have all you guys to thank.
11733552	11734553	And it just keeps getting bigger.
11734613	11736595	Every week I see new faces coming into the chatroom.
11736635	11737135	It's awesome.
11739037	11739477	It's awesome.
11740918	11741779	And we love you guys.
11742980	11744782	I'm sorry that you haven't gotten laid.
11746503	11747664	That's Pixie Dust.
11748925	11749245	I know.
11749506	11750947	I'm sorry that she hasn't gotten laid.
11752785	11755607	You come over, pixie dust, I'll show you good times.
11755807	11758789	You know what, people... I'll show your boobs some lovin'.
11759129	11761490	People don't need to get laid to be happy.
11761931	11762231	They don't.
11762691	11765233	Some people are perfectly happy being asexual.
11765453	11771656	But, but, but, getting laid definitely, like, takes the little, like, hyper dog out of you, you know?
11771676	11775419	It's just like... You know what this may be?
11775479	11778961	And to be honest, I can think of a few people that could use a little mellowing.
11782586	11783927	I'm sorry.
11784168	11784788	You know what?
11785228	11788090	I'm sorry that getting laid just does one thing for me.
11788110	11789031	It makes me want ice cream.
11790032	11790452	That's it.
11791173	11791773	Just remember.
11792534	11795836	Yes, could I order vanilla cream with an orgasm mix-in?
11797037	11798859	No, come back here and make your comment on there.
11798899	11799499	That was great.
11799719	11800500	That was brilliant.
11802021	11805604	Just remember, without sex, Ben and Jerry's wouldn't be doing so well.
11808359	11809160	Orange Cream, anyone?
11812101	11813582	What else am I thinking of here?
11813602	11814302	Vanilla Chunk?
11817044	11817404	I don't know.
11817544	11819905	It had something to do with this show, but I guess it wasn't that bad.
11819925	11820545	Trainwreck!
11820645	11821126	I know what it is.
11821186	11821746	I know what it is.
11821786	11823107	No, it actually has nothing to do with this show.
11823127	11825428	It has to do with getting laid, which is even better than this show.
11825548	11827369	It has to do with this show.
11827869	11828369	You know what?
11828409	11830710	Some people don't need to get laid.
11831171	11832511	Some people just want to cuddle.
11833792	11833892	Aww.
11837621	11844386	There's a funny line in Boondock Saints where they're talking about cuddling.
11844746	11850570	Because the one cop who's the perfect investigator, and he's a gay guy, but he acts like a straight guy.
11850610	11851071	It's kind of weird.
11851131	11852852	It's like this guy's trying to cuddle with him.
11852892	11853993	He's like, what the fuck you want?
11854033	11854733	You want to cuddle?
11855154	11856575	He's like, man, you're so gay.
11856755	11858096	And then he gets up and walks away.
11859076	11859757	That was funny.
11866890	11876158	All right, let's get it.
11876178	11876539	All right.
11877199	11878981	I hope you've had your fill.
11879281	11879601	All right.
11881603	11882124	That's it.
11882344	11884126	We're going to go into post-show now.
11884266	11885747	It's Spencer McGeehan music.
11886668	11888850	Started off with a little bit of Ayumi Hamasaki, huh?
11889648	11890408	We'll depend on you.
11890449	11892390	I can't wait to mute these microphones.
11893170	11894591	Say goodbye to the ferrets, Jamie.
11895091	11896612	They're coming with me.
11897152	11898493	You can't take them back.
11898513	11899734	You'll never see.
11900214	11900554	Oh, wait.
11900975	11905517	I have to take them back.
11905637	11910700	If you ever leave, when that day comes, we'll be together from there.
12093531	12095573	Thank you for watching!
12277703	12278984	Thanks for watching!
12308022	12316527	I want to die to the light of the ocean of love I want to die to the light of the ocean of love
