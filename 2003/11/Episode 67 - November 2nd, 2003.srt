00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,780

click on Orange Lounge, and click on chat.

130
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,800
And in the chat room, by the way, chat room is up on the television screen

131
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,020
so we can all see what you're saying.

132
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,660
So it's interactive when you're in our chat room.

133
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:58,020
Jamie, first tell us, I want everybody to know about these games that you brought

134
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,600
to the show tonight, because they're pretty cool.

135
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,720
I have them all in the chat room, sorry.

136
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,120
Well, I'll put them up on, the cam's updating, right?

137
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,680
I'll put them up on the.

138
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,700
Yeah, once and once in a while.

139
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,740
Well, you have to explain for those that aren't going to be on the cam.

140
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,360
You're going to have to give the.

141
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,300
Okay. I am an old school gaming freak.

142
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,660
I love old games.

143
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,420
So. Nothing wrong with that.

144
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:25,500
When Dan and I discovered that Sega was kind enough to release updated versions

145
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,120
of their older games, we hopped right on it and grabbed our three favorites.

146
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:28,860
Right on.

147
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,860
Of course, one of them was backordered, so we're still waiting for a Phantasy Star collection.

148
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:33,860
No surprise there.

149
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,860
Well, actually, this is the remake of the first Phantasy Star.

150
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,860
If anyone ever played it on the Master System, you know what I'm talking about.

151
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,860
Right.

152
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:45,860
But they put out another two games that are probably about my second and third favorite game ever.

153
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,860
And what will be the first game ever?

154
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,860
Guardian Legend.

155
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,860
Amen, sister.

156
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,860
I seriously doubt that's ever going to get a release.

157
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:57,860
But the first one I'm putting up on cam right now is probably my other favorite game, like, ever.

158
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:04,020
ever and for those who can't see the cam i'm trying to get to where they'll adjust it's

159
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:11,620
fantasy zone the game that brought us the opa opa which is this cute little ship with angelings

160
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:17,220
with feet and when you're on the ground he has little legs and he's super cute see there it is

161
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:22,820
on the camera fantasy zone um and then the other awesome game it's funny because the way you held

162
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:32,460
did that be still have Loki on part of the picture now let me see this may be a

163
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,700
little bit better okay so space Harrier being the other game which is some those

164
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:41,140
that may not recognize space Harrier by name because I didn't at first I kind of

165
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,220
had to I kind of had to get visuals of these games so let me kind of describe

166
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:50,260
them for you fantasy zone is like this it's like defender but in beautiful

167
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:56,600
beautiful pastels, and I never thought I'd refer to pastels as a beautiful thing, but

168
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,400
Fantasy Zone really pulls it off.

169
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,240
It's like uber cute in the way it's painted.

170
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,800
It looks like a color by number.

171
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:09,040
And when you're looking dead on, it looks like it's fully 2D, but they're really actually

172
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,840
flat, self-shaded polygons.

173
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,600
That's kind of the point I wanted to get to about these re-releases, is that they didn't

174
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,840
Now it's not like a Namco museum game or an Atari museum game where they just took the old games

175
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,880
Put them on a CD and emulated it. Basically. No, they took these games

176
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:32,000
Totally redid them. I'm guessing maybe they took the original code and redid the graphics. Yep completely and

177
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:39,320
About it. I mean actually I think they're they're fresh from scratch, but they play just like holy fuck. Are they beautiful?

178
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,800
I was impressed. I mean these games I

179
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:47,040
I wasn't like huge fans of them like Jamie was when they were first out, but I remember

180
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,160
playing Phantasy Zone.

181
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,160
I read it one weekend.

182
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:55,040
I played it on the Nintendo where it looked like barf because the color palette isn't

183
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,840
the same as it is on a Sega, so it looks all messed up.

184
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:10,240
The reason why is that the Nintendo was not set up for pastel color where the Master System

185
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,240
was.

186
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,740
So I played them and they looked like barf, but coming back now and playing them again, I'm just like,

187
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,360
oh my god, this is so beautiful. Finally we're using a next generation system

188
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,400
to make our 2D games look even better.

189
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:28,760
It's so cool. Dear 8-bit companies like Nintendo, anybody that was big in the 8-bit days,

190
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,680
even Konami.

191
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,640
It would be nice to have Super Konami World Collection

192
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,960
in 3D. Seriously, I want you all to take up this project.

193
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,200
Do your old 2D games in 3D like this because they are so cool.

194
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,280
It's just, oh man, especially when you're going to release one of these old

195
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,240
kind of like old school game packs and re-release this like a new thing.

196
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,720
I just, oh it's so beautiful. Words can't express.

197
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,360
They also come with another little neat thing though. If you bought the special edition

198
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,600
of Phantasy Star, which we actually didn't get, it came with a little binder.

199
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,920
And in the binder you would put these

200
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,560
cards

201
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:15,040
Okay, that are basically just description of the game some of the history of it. I'm putting

202
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,060
Up on the cam. That's still kind of neat though

203
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:28,000
So, um, but they're also they're bringing out more games the ones that are out right now in the series is

204
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,940
There was of course a fantasy star

205
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,360
Space Harrier, Fantasy Zone, Monaco GP

206
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,560
the Golden Axe, the other one.

207
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,840
Golden Axe is pretty.

208
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,840
Oh my God.

209
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:48,480
There's a site, actually if you go to the live stream of Community Girl Gamers and just

210
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,420
look for my post, I put a big post there about it with a link to the Japanese site where

211
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:00,640
you can watch a streaming video of screens from the first five releases.

212
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,460
I'm thinking you need to make that a cross post to the Orange Lounge community.

213
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:12,960
I'll go look for my old post, but the next ones that are coming out, and actually I didn't

214
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:20,740
find those out until I looked for the pre-orders on Licksang, but the next one out is Columns,

215
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,980
and then the other one, I don't remember what it is, it's the game that didn't come out

216
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,980
over here.

217
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,980
I'll have to check out all of them.

218
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,100
Oh my God, please tell me they're going to do Alex Kidd.

219
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,100
Wouldn't it be nice?

220
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,100
Yeah, Alex Kidd was a Sega game, wasn't it?

221
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,100
Yes, it was.

222
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,100
What would be really cool is if...

223
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,100
And Shinobi?

224
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,100
Oh, they did Shinobi.

225
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,100
Yeah, but...

226
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,100
Okay, I'm not counting the new Shinobi, the new...

227
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,100
You know what actually I think would be cool?

228
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:54,100
Is it Michael Jackson Moonwalker?

229
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,100
And Michael Jackson Moonwalker?

230
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,100
Oh, yeah.

231
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,100
What?

232
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,100
What?

233
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,100
Moonwalker was kind of 3D to begin with.

234
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,100
It was one of those cheap...

235
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:09,100
It was still a 2D game, but it was 3D, like it was like the Ninja Turtles where you can move up and down, but you know what?

236
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,100
Well, this is the last thing, and you know how in Sonic Adventure 2, how they had the bonus?

237
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:18,100
That was the remake of the Green Hill Zone from the first Sonic game?

238
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:24,100
Wouldn't it be cool if they took, like, the original Sonic games and did them like that?

239
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,100
Absolutely.

240
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:42,100
And then of course, this was just kind of brought up, I think this was brought up in the chat room, I think this is where I saw it, but my very favorite old school Sega game of all time, they badly need to do this port 2, Altered Beast.

241
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,100
Rise from your grave.

242
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,220
I cannot wait for them to do Altered Beasts like this.

243
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:54,260
This is, man, I'm just picturing, like, I'm kind of picturing, I'm going back to Castlevania

244
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,300
because for those who were listening to Vanilla Sky on Monday,

245
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:00,440
we were talking about the new Castlevania and kind of got into a discussion on, like, you know,

246
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:05,100
is Castlevania good or what have you because of the 3D-ness of it now.

247
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,120
I'm just thinking, oh my God.

248
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,100
And why would you play it in Japanese without the shitty US voice acting?

249
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,080
Oh my God, that's so much crap.

250
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,640
But I just go back and think, oh my God, what if like Simon's Quest were done like this

251
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,280
Fantasy Zone thing is?

252
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,840
I would have an orgasm.

253
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,640
You know, SEGA's always been really smart with their games.

254
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,440
They've just had, you know, bad advertising and, you know, going up against basically

255
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,960
a major monopoly like, you know, Sony is.

256
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,160
You know, they say that they didn't have, you know, take from their other facilities,

257
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:43,500
but you can tell they put major money behind the Playstation even though the Saturn to

258
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,040
this day is still a better system.

259
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:50,000
The Dreamcast to this day still had better games than many of us do.

260
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,320
You will go to your grave a Sega fangirl.

261
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:59,140
You know I used to be a Nintendo fangirl 100% and now my whole support of Nintendo comes

262
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,040
just because Sega is supporting them.

263
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:08,360
Isn't it so weird now to fire up a game like F-Zero, and you see on the first screen Sega

264
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,360
Nintendo.

265
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:15,320
It's like, wow, ten years ago you're picturing those ads in your mind, Sega does what Nintendo

266
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,320
does.

267
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,320
Well, you know what?

268
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:23,760
I remember on one of my tapes, one of my old tapes off Japanese TV, watching the monkeys,

269
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,400
these two little monkeys playing TV, and one of them was playing a Saturn, playing Burning

270
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,640
Rangers on the Saturn if this dates this for you and the other one was playing like

271
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:40,560
Some other game on like an older crappy game on the PlayStation and the PlayStation monkey went to go play the Saturn

272
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,880
I have to address something that came up in the chat room. We have some new chatters tonight

273
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,840
So hello to all our new folks. We love seeing some new faces in our chair room

274
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,180
I love a guy named Bargo who says a bunch of numbers is a little bit

275
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:57,460
disgusted by the thought of me having an orgasm over a game. You know what? There is nothing

276
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:01,940
better than an orgasm. You name me one thing in this world that's better than an orgasm.

277
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:06,180
Two orgasms! Two orgasms! Thank you, Loki!

278
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:11,780
Really good ice cream. Maybe if you're a woman, but...

279
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:19,140
If I was sitting between the best orgasm ever and a bowl of Chocolate Decadence Blue Bell

280
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:31,720
ice cream. Chocolate orgasm. Ooh. And this may be TMI. Is that a cold stone? Actually

281
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:39,560
the best best thing ever is the bowl of ice cream you eat after an orgasm. Is to go out,

282
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:45,760
fuck a bunch, and then eat a bowl of ice cream. For some it's the cigarettes, for some it's

283
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:51,240
the ice cream. Next time I'm going to go into Cold Stone, I'm going to be all, yeah, could

284
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:59,520
I get the, I'd like to get the vanilla cream with the orgasm mix in.

285
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:06,400
You know what we need to do, we need to sit and create, call it the orange lounge orgasm

286
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,480
at Cold Stone. And keep, and like, put the right flavors in it.

287
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,480
Oh, like write it in.

288
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,480
I don't have those anymore. You can't do it.

289
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,480
I was going to put mine in.

290
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,480
I used to have my cherry cheesecake flavor.

291
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,480
That I just called the dark soccer club.

292
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,480
How original.

293
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:35,480
It was graham cracker, brownie, cheesecake, and cherry pie filling.

294
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,480
It was so good and so bad for me.

295
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,480
I want ice cream now.

296
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,480
God damn it, I want ice cream!

297
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:47,480
As good as that sounds, Jamie, orgasms are better.

298
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,480
Anyway, I think we got off on a little bit of a tangent there.

299
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,480
Sorry, kids.

300
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,480
That's what we do here on Orange Island.

301
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,480
Welcome to the Fantasy Zone.

302
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,480
Get ready.

303
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,480
I was so happy because it's in there.

304
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,480
Does it actually have voice acting?

305
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,480
Well, yeah.

306
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,480
It's like, okay, this is what happened.

307
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,480
I wish we could play it for the chat room, but we really can't.

308
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:13,080
When you start off the game, it doesn't say welcome to the fantasy zone, get ready, at

309
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:19,680
least the first time you did it, it's like, get ready, Harrier, or something like that.

310
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,520
I bet you were pissed when you heard that.

311
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:28,800
Oh, I was, and then four games later, watching Dan play it the other night, it finally said

312
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,800
it.

313
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:36,480
I remember when I first ever like saw your post back on DDR Freak I remember

314
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,600
that was your signature welcome to the fantasy zone get ready and I always

315
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:45,880
thought it was actually from fantasy zone common misconception I'm sure is

316
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:51,880
set in the same universe as fantasy zone I think a lot of people don't realize

317
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,960
that yeah I know you've mentioned that to me before watch the if you look at

318
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,000
the original games your fantasy zone has the big plaid floors and everything and

319
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,000
And then you have the Checkered Ground, and then the Checkered Ground is in Space Harrier, the originals.

320
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And it's set in the same universe, although they made it completely different for these two.

321
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
They look completely different.

322
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
So, here's my final thought on the whole 8-bit games being redone.

323
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Guardian Legend remake, Guardian Legend remake.

324
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Deer, Broderbund, and who else put that game out?

325
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I don't remember.

326
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Broderbund was the publisher of it.

327
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Please do a Guardian Legend remake.

328
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,280
make. Oh my god, I would never leave the house, ever. It's done. It would be more addicting

329
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,280
than-

330
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,360
You know, there was, there wasn't a game that came out-

331
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,360
Guardian Legend Online.

332
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,360
Oh my god.

333
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,520
No, I don't know. Guardian Legend is not a game to be played online. Guardian Legend

334
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,000
is a masturbatory game. It's a solo experience.

335
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,920
Yeah, it's, you know what? They need to freakin' do-

336
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,920
It's a solo orgasm.

337
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,800
You know what? It was the original, it was the original survival horror game.

338
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,960
I don't know if I'd call it a horror game.

339
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,560
Well, okay, but it was the original survival game, if you think about it.

340
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:06,280
Because here you are, on this planet, by yourself, you know, this is before Samus ever did her

341
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:10,960
deal, I think, because there was the, what do you call it, Guardia, that came out before

342
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,960
that on the MSX.

343
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,960
Yeah, okay.

344
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,960
I mean, if you want to get technical with that.

345
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,960
Didn't the MSX come out before the Famicom?

346
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,960
It did.

347
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,960
Okay.

348
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,960
But yeah, I think it was on the MSX.

349
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:26,280
But anyway, you know, you're there and you can turn into a ship, but you have to go find

350
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,280
weapons.

351
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,600
I mean, she was doing it before Snake ever did his thing.

352
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,240
It's the same thing too.

353
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,840
It's tactical, survival, espionage, horror shooting game.

354
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:41,320
I always, I don't know if I'd go as far to say that it was this new genre of game that

355
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:48,640
was fabulous, but what it did is it took two genres of existing games like Zelda and Gradius

356
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,280
to kind of name two more like life force maybe but took these two days and brought them together

357
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,400
so beautifully.

358
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,320
It's just like going to a wedding and crying at the beautiful union of these two things.

359
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,040
And it had the little thingies from Adventure of Lolo.

360
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,040
What?

361
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,460
The blue thingies from Adventure of Lolo.

362
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,460
It did.

363
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,460
They've had the shots.

364
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:15,180
I don't think they were, I think they were supposed to be, they're related to the blue

365
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:22,700
things from Zexes Z-E-Y-X-Z that game Zexes? Yeah I think it's related to those

366
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:27,420
blue guys not the Lolo guy I think Lolo is a different blue guy. So I was like hey the guys

367
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:32,740
from adventure from adventure Lolo left they're boycotting. It was I you know it

368
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:36,740
had really good music in it too and I also knew the trick where you could walk

369
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:41,900
through the the wall the divider walls in the center like if you held your

370
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:45,800
controller at an angle and you could walk through the wall and get to the

371
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:51,680
other side. Epic games are great. And you know the other neat controller trick was

372
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:57,360
the one for Mega Man 3. I submitted the thing to Nintendo Power

373
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,020
way back when because I was the first person on the world that found this little trick. You know

374
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:07,460
everyone knew about the double jump in Mega Man 3 where you hold down your

375
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,520
left and right and I think A button or something like that on the second

376
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,760
controller and you can I put it on the floor and sit in a chair and hold it with

377
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,280
my feet but if you fall down a hole and then you let go and then hit it again

378
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,120
you'll hear the die noise and then you can jump out of the hole and you have no

379
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:29,080
life really and you can use the only way that you can shoot anything is to use

380
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:35,440
your special weapons because your shot is also your life but if you hit a power

381
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,640
up you know a life refill then you have to do the trick again but it's really

382
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:45,880
convenient when you're going against a boss and they can't kill you because you're already

383
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:52,440
dead. So that's, you know, I'm going off on a tangent right now.

384
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,520
Hooray for aggression. That's all right. All right, we need a topic

385
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:02,480
change. So you're going to be gone the next two weeks. So what's going on? For those that

386
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,800
are just joining us tonight, because I know we have some new folks, what's going on? Why

387
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,000
are you going to be leaving us the next couple of weeks?

388
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,260
I'm going to see my family.

389
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,220
The fifth is my mama's birthday.

390
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,820
I'm very pissed off that this is going

391
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,980
to go into the Vikings of the week

392
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,180
because I can't buy my mom her Alan Jackson tickets

393
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,300
because I can't afford them.

394
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,180
Which I'm really not that upset about me missing Alan Jackson,

395
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,300
but mom is really good.

396
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,660
And unless the credit card I signed up for arrives,

397
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,780
I can't get her tickets.

398
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,180
So I'm going to take her out to eat.

399
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:39,720
I'm going to try to do something nice, but the general itinerary is spending time

400
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:45,280
with my family, spending time with my mama-san and papa-san, who are really,

401
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,660
really good friends of mine who took care of me when I needed some place to stay.

402
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,980
Going to my college and getting my transcripts, because you know technically I'm still enrolled

403
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,420
at the University of South Alabama.

404
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,140
Technically, I'm still enrolled at a school in California, too.

405
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:58,700
Mm-hmm.

406
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:04,500
I'm going to have to get a SARS mask to go visit my mom's house

407
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,300
because she and her husband both smoke and also have a dog.

408
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,740
What am I super allergic to?

409
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,820
Cigarette-smoking dog.

410
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,900
Didn't you, oh, I don't, I'm a fan of Tangerine.

411
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,240
Well, yeah, but.

412
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,440
But it was the cigars because I wasn't allergic to them.

413
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,060
But I think it's different.

414
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,300
Once you quit, like, it can.

415
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,300
Well, it's really stupid to me because I had asthma.

416
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,860
It can really affect you.

417
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:33,820
Honestly, and I know that probably some people who are listening smoke,

418
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:37,080
I know that some people do every so often.

419
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,480
But I still think that it's probably the most retarded thing anyone can do to themselves.

420
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:47,360
That, and it's also pretty, and forgive me for saying so, this is how I feel about it.

421
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,400
It's also pretty inconsiderate of other people because you're poisoning their air.

422
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,160
If you think about it.

423
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,760
They have to breathe the smoke.

424
00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:00,680
And oh my God, I went to the casino and I thought I was going to die.

425
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,680
You went to the casino?

426
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:07,320
I went to Thunder Valley yesterday with Iguana Girl and Islander.

427
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,920
You know what's weird about that casino?

428
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,920
No arcade.

429
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,920
Yeah.

430
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,200
I'm such a dork.

431
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,440
The first time the casino opened up, I'm like, oh, maybe there will be a cool DDR machine

432
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,960
because that's just what an addict I am.

433
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,280
No arcade to be found anywhere.

434
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,720
Where do the kids go when mommy and daddy go to gambling?

435
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,600
I know that happens a lot.

436
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,200
I think that they lock them in the trunk.

437
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,200
The whole reason we went was to play bingo.

438
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,880
They have bingo there?

439
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,880
They have bingo.

440
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,880
It's pretty fun.

441
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,880
When?

442
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,880
They do it once an hour.

443
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,880
It's basically 45-50 minutes of bingo.

444
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,880
Holy shit.

445
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,760
You can do the electronic or you can do the paper play.

446
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,880
In the paper play, you basically get twice as many cards.

447
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,240
Is there a separate room for bingo or something?

448
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,360
Like a convention room.

449
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,560
I have never seen the bingo room.

450
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,480
It says bingo and big old letters inside.

451
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,160
Like when you go in the door and head off to the right

452
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:03,440
and around past the snack area, there's the bingo room.

453
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:11,140
But it's $12 for the paper play and the lightning progressive round and the validation.

454
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,600
But it's pretty fun.

455
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,640
And, you know, I was really close to a blackout.

456
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,000
I mean, I was like three away.

457
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:16,800
Right.

458
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,440
So.

459
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,980
Did anybody win anything?

460
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,800
Do one of you get three folks on the floor?

461
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,180
Oh, bummer.

462
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:29,800
But I, we went back to play on the slot machines trying to earn money for the next game.

463
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:34,820
And I just, when we sat down in front of a machine, put a dollar in it and got 15.50 back.

464
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,360
It's one of those, you know, where you can play up to 15 lines or nine lines or something.

465
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:45,240
And I got, I only played one line, get this, I played one line, the middle line,

466
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:51,620
and it was the one that's all like, like the poker faces, like 10 and up.

467
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,960
And I got all 10s across.

468
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:59,100
So I actually won like 17 off of it that I played a couple more rounds.

469
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,540
My future strategy for casinos, I've learned from Lanky Style,

470
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:06,240
one of the folks you hear on Vanilla Sky, video poker is where it's at.

471
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,980
Honestly, when I was in Reno last time, the only place I made money was video poker.

472
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,180
And that is all I'm ever going to play.

473
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,520
I lost all my video poker skills.

474
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,440
I don't know what happened.

475
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,680
That is all I'm ever going to play in the future.

476
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,140
When I was in Vegas for the ZDF Freak Moderators trip,

477
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:20,040
I was at the end of my money when we were leaving.

478
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:25,280
I had fifty cents in my pocket and I turned it into ten dollars

479
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,960
because I needed a cap there.

480
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,920
I'm looking at the chat room some of the comments on bingo we have some folks

481
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,000
that say they

482
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,880
hate bingo, you get complimentary prune juice, my grandma plays bingo with shuffleboard

483
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,240
was it a lot of old people there playing bingo?

484
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,280
There were old people there but there were a lot of young people too.

485
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,480
I'm noticing bingo seems to be like a younger and younger thing because

486
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:54,400
We had a girl in one of my classes where I work and we asked everybody, why are you hired

487
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,440
at work and why did you decide to come to this place and work?

488
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,480
One of the girls actually said, I have to fund my bingo addiction.

489
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,680
She had a daughter in her purse.

490
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,960
Not like a son and daughter, but like a bingo daughter, a dauber, not a daughter, a dauber.

491
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,000
She had a dauber in her purse with her, always.

492
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,640
You think we're obsessed on this show?

493
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:20,040
Well, the thing is, is that they actually have, you know, they've got site machines, but they also have like

494
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,360
soda fountain machines, and coffee,

495
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,760
and tea, and I made a latte

496
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:31,520
there for myself. I think I played bingo and had a latte with whipped cream.

497
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,560
Well, they have a Starbucks in the casino. You know what they have in the casino?

498
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,920
A fatburger. I can't either. I know, but it's...

499
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,120
Although I did hear they have turkey burgers, so I'll have to go there for a turkey burger.

500
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:45,600
Oh my god, I ate a pork cutlet. It made me sick, too.

501
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,160
Did you go to the buffet there?

502
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,920
No, I ate it at my friend's house.

503
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,200
We wanted to go to Fresh Choice, so we could come back.

504
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,440
When you come back from Alabama, we'll go play bingo,

505
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,020
and we'll go late so we can go to the buffet,

506
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,360
because the buffet is so good.

507
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,080
The thing is, we played the five and seven game.

508
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,040
And the thing is, though, is that you

509
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,680
don't get a second chance on the five and seven game.

510
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,040
So we need to go play the earlier games

511
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,880
if we're going to go.

512
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,440
Interesting.

513
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,280
So you can get a second chance to win, because I was close.

514
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,160
Is it going 24 hours a day?

515
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:17,800
No, I don't think so.

516
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,520
Oh, well shit.

517
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,440
Because the buffet is like, I know

518
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,560
this is really interesting to all our listeners out of town,

519
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,920
but just bear with us.

520
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:30,200
The buffet is only like $6 after 11 o'clock at night.

521
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,520
Holy crap, we should go.

522
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,560
You have to go late.

523
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:38,080
But man, if you don't eat all day and then go, oh.

524
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,040
What's it like during the day?

525
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,120
Pricey?

526
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,200
Like $15.

527
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,200
That's still not bad.

528
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,480
Not bad, but considering everything you get, not bad.

529
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:54,240
The one I went to at the, I wouldn't say the Beaux-Rivage, but that's one in Biloxi where

530
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:00,200
my friend works, but it was the Rio Casino.

531
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:06,560
They have a seafood buffet, it was like 30 bucks, but you get like Maine lobster on the

532
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,840
buffet.

533
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:15,040
I was like king crab, Alaskan snow crab, and everything.

534
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,040
I was like, oh, fish.

535
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:17,540
OK.

536
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,840
But that's, 15's not bad compared.

537
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,160
Well, we'll have to go and get back.

538
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,360
But have fun in Alabama.

539
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,200
I don't know what we're going to do on the show

540
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,960
without you while you're gone.

541
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,080
Because Loki and I, the last time

542
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,960
we did a show by ourselves, it was very interesting.

543
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,240
Yeah, that was the first time Loki made super bacon on the air.

544
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:39,560
I'm hoping we have a temporary fill-in somehow.

545
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,560
Oh, we'll get somebody.

546
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:46,520
to find a woman because we need the female perspective on the show you know

547
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:51,680
what we need to get yeah we need to make melody come down now we'll figure

548
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:58,560
something out we need to get pixie too I haven't yet to meet her I've heard good

549
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,040
things about her but I have to meet Oh pixie dust I'm thinking I'm thinking of

550
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:09,840
the other pixie there's two pixies and then I'll have to like call you know

551
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:14,920
I'll just we'll just get all the women here in your absence. We'll get Irene and melody and Janae and

552
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:22,560
Violent hyper girl, we'll just get them all here one night, and you know we'll have a we'll have a girls night on orange lounge

553
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:30,260
And I'll just be sitting in the corner making fun of everyone else

554
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,900
We'll see

555
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,140
We'll see

556
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:44,540
Well, so who knows what's gonna happen when when you're gone, but we'll still be doing shows you're gonna miss episode 69

557
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,540
I cry that's okay

558
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:52,500
But some more announcements about what's coming up to the station. So big changes coming in November all through the month, really?

559
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:57,620
So we'll talk about that in a little while. Oh my god, my voice still isn't all the way back

560
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,140
Well, I was just about to go into

561
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,940
I was just about to go into how was your week? How was your day?

562
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,840
So, I'll let you continue your bitching by asking you, how was your week?

563
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,280
How was your day?

564
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:16,680
I didn't have a voice most of the week, and as everyone can tell, it's barely, barely back.

565
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:23,400
I felt lots better, you know, progressively throughout the day.

566
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,020
The cough is, I guess, as everyone can tell, mostly cleared up,

567
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,460
although I still need the codeine at night.

568
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,360
I'm on happy drugs.

569
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,000
I took the last of my antibiotics today.

570
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:32,780
Whee!

571
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:38,360
I didn't touch my bimani except to lend it out to people while I'm out of town.

572
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:40,460
And.

573
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,560
Shit, I should have gotten my ignition pad back.

574
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,020
Oh well.

575
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,120
That's all right.

576
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,720
He's going to have the super ones done soon enough.

577
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:53,120
Okay. Yeah, I haven't been able to play DDR while my asthma has been so bad.

578
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,480
But I'm going to play an Alabama and I'm going to play the BeatMania 6 Mix Machine

579
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,800
if they still have it in the middle of the wall.

580
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,880
I'm looking forward to that.

581
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,040
Really, I didn't do a lot, much of anything.

582
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,380
Dan and I went out a bunch.

583
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:18,880
We, on Halloween, my work, every department decorated for a contest.

584
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:28,780
And like there's this one group that's in another building at the, at the, I just told Bob where it is.

585
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:34,880
But there's another building back there that they did, Studio 100M.

586
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,480
So they made it up like a dance club.

587
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:42,480
And it was really nice, but like one of the rooms upstairs was the super VIP room.

588
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:49,240
And they had like baking powder out on a mirror with a laser blade to the liquid cane.

589
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,200
And everyone was dressed up all 70s and everything.

590
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,720
Oh, that's a lovely picture.

591
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,380
One of the other places was they did it up like the Old West.

592
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,680
It was really nice the way they did it.

593
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,020
You know, had a bum in the jail and everything.

594
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,300
And another one was the haunted pirate ship.

595
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,560
And one was the 60s.

596
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,480
They did the 60s theme.

597
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:16,120
And you know they handed out the snacks, brownies, and this stuff called bong water.

598
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:17,500
Oh, how nice.

599
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,500
It's a drink that these people are making in Arizona,

600
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,880
and they're going to be marketing it here now.

601
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:27,420
Coming up in the next few months or so, and I tried it and it's really good.

602
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:31,060
It's not really carbonated, but more like a flavored water beverage.

603
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,060
It's really good.

604
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:38,220
Now, customer service was the best, and we won best, of course.

605
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,220
Did you?

606
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:47,220
We were haven and heck, and I decided that I was going to be in hell, so I wear my evil

607
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,220
boots.

608
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,220
Where you belong.

609
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:57,820
I wear my evil boots that I wear at Anima Expo for my Mad Hatter costume, the ones that

610
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:01,240
make me instantly fight it just taller.

611
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:08,220
Black pinstripe pants, this black corporate looking top, and my black wings.

612
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:15,140
I had lots of really gothic makeup and carried my whip with me, and I was a modern day angel

613
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,140
of death.

614
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:22,540
And all the chemicals were lined in black, and the walls were black and red, and we had

615
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:26,300
a guillotine, and we had the grim reaper hanging out in the corner.

616
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,300
Off with their heads.

617
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,300
Fire.

618
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,300
Did you have any watermelons?

619
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,180
We had these fakes coming into the major walkways, and they had fire erasing from them.

620
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,380
We had little torches, fake fire everywhere.

621
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,380
Cool.

622
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,380
And we had the lights off.

623
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,380
Fire's great.

624
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:41,060
So it was all red and fiery and everything.

625
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:45,140
I totally missed Halloween in my work, but I'll get into that later.

626
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:52,640
But one of the girls at my work, her costume was the best she did, the girl from The Ring,

627
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,640
the TV girl.

628
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,640
Cool.

629
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:59,080
Keep in mind, I haven't seen The Ring, but I knew her costume.

630
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,320
She won scariest costume, and it was perfect.

631
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,320
It was absolutely perfect.

632
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:06,720
The Ring, for a contemporary horror movie, it's really, really good.

633
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,600
I need to watch Ringo.

634
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:13,800
I have actually heard that some people, even folks that usually prefer Javanese cinema,

635
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,080
say the ring is better but i've heard mixed well i've heard that the first

636
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:20,520
one's more the japanese ones more suspense and the american ones more

637
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,560
horror

638
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:26,160
yeah i could see that and i would go for the suspense over the other

639
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,280
and i watched movie trailers today

640
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,800
preview for a movie i have to see what's that alien vs predator

641
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:39,460
oh give me give me a break that looks like crap no i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm

642
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:43,460
I'm going to see it because I've read some of the comics, I love the game.

643
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:46,460
Alien vs. Predator needs to stay a video game.

644
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,460
I know it's nothing like the comics.

645
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:56,460
I have a question. I have a question that will determine if this movie will suck or not.

646
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,460
Is Sigourney Weaver in it?

647
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,460
No.

648
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,460
Fuck this movie.

649
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:01,460
But I'm still going to see it.

650
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:06,460
I'm still going to see it just because I want to see all the action that ensues.

651
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:07,460
I don't care about the story.

652
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:10,980
I'm there to see predators and aliens beating each other up.

653
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,340
This movie ruins the continuity of all the sequels.

654
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:18,620
Seriously, it makes no sense with this movie being there.

655
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:19,620
It makes no sense.

656
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:20,620
It's just retarded.

657
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:25,020
I would rather see Freddy vs Jason ten more times.

658
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:32,340
I'd rather go see The House of the Dead than this movie.

659
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:36,680
The story is utter shit, but I think the action is going to be good.

660
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:42,720
And I want to see the decapitations and shootings and blood and crap.

661
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,880
I want to see all...

662
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,880
I'm going...

663
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,880
I want to see the production.

664
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,880
Alright, fair enough.

665
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,880
So you're in it for the violence.

666
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:48,880
I'm in it for the violence.

667
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,880
Alright, fair enough.

668
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,880
That I can...

669
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,880
That for me is going to be a gore test.

670
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:52,880
The cheesy gore, I can deal with that as a reason.

671
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,880
I don't...

672
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,880
The story is shit.

673
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,880
However, let's see Alien vs. Predator vs. Ash.

674
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,880
How about it?

675
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,880
Huh?

676
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:59,880
How about it?

677
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,880
I'll just bring out the boomstick.

678
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,720
The question from Chat Room Jamie, is the featurette on the web somewhere?

679
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:12,920
If you go to apple.com slash trailers, it's actually in, I think the, either,

680
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,660
I think there's four columns and it's in the, the second one.

681
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,440
Cool. So what other movie trailers did you watch?

682
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,260
I watched one for Resident Evil Apocalypse.

683
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,160
That was funny.

684
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,260
Is that the sequel?

685
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:29,840
Yeah. It's a commercial for the stuff called Regenerate.

686
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,160
And this woman, and you can tell it's obviously touched up, a young woman,

687
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,360
but she's got it looking all wrinkled and everything.

688
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,460
And it's like, it looks like, for the people who saw Resident Evil,

689
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:46,100
it looks like the T-Virus thing that they dropped at the beginning.

690
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,900
It's like using T-cell technology.

691
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,720
You know, I wasn't a huge fan of the Resident Evil movie.

692
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,520
I mean, there just aren't a lot of good video game movies.

693
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,700
I know a lot of the hardcore date gamers really did like the movie.

694
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:03,880
I'm kind of in a minority there, but maybe I'll check out the sequel when it's on video.

695
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,880
You need to watch the trailer, though, because it is hilarious.

696
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:19,880
I'm sorry, the best movie, you know, game movie adaptions have to be, without a doubt, Street Fighter and Double Dragon. They rocked like nothing else.

697
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,880
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

698
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,880
No, I thought you were going to see Super Mario Brothers.

699
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,880
Has there been a really, really good one?

700
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,880
Well...

701
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:30,880
Mortal Kombat was decent.

702
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,880
Mortal Kombat was good.

703
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,920
when I was at that age.

704
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,240
You know what I thought would have, was better than,

705
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,840
and actually it's another Van Damme movie,

706
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,380
but I thought it was better than the Street Fighter movie

707
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,740
that they did, because it seemed like it fit more in it.

708
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:45,080
What was it called, The Quest?

709
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,340
Yeah, there was a Van Damme movie called The Quest.

710
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,740
That made me think of the Street Fighter flick,

711
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,840
what Street Fighter should have been.

712
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,020
I had that whole impression when I saw it, and I went and saw

713
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,740
that one in the theater because it was a dollar movie.

714
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:59,560
The whole reason I was there is because I went there

715
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,120
to play one of my favorite games ever,

716
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:09,120
Starblade because they had the one in the big crane set up when you paid 75 cents and you were in this full 3D motion.

717
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,120
Cool.

718
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:15,120
And they told me that I had to see a movie to keep playing the game so I went and saw that.

719
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:20,120
And then I went and saw that because I was like the only person who could.

720
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,120
The Last Starfighter.

721
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,120
Wasn't that, that was the game?

722
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,120
The game came out after the movie.

723
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,120
The game came out after the movie.

724
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,120
The game came out after the movie.

725
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:32,120
Whatever, it still ties together.

726
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,120
Last time I thought it was a good movie.

727
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,120
You lose, try again.

728
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,120
But no, I never was a good one.

729
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:44,120
I just can't think of what it was.

730
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,120
Let's ask our chat room.

731
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,120
What?

732
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,120
What do they think?

733
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:50,120
You know, we need to do a list tonight.

734
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:54,120
What game needs to be made into a movie?

735
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,120
We can do it.

736
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,120
Just three of us?

737
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,120
Sure, why not?

738
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:00,680
We'll put four things on instead of three okay fair enough, okay?

739
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:08,760
Okay, I'm cool guys. We haven't done that ever no. Well. Okay. We'll do that. I thought we had to

740
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:15,440
Well, I'll ask the orange lounge historian that such as dark to be our angel that follows the show better than we do

741
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:20,960
If you've done that before I don't think we have I don't think that we've done that one I

742
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:26,960
I know we've joked a lot about DDR the movie on this show, but I don't think we ever did that one.

743
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:32,960
What a big hoax. You know, I laugh to this day about the people who thought it was going to happen.

744
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:42,960
I still think, especially after seeing the Para Para manga, which I think came up on Vanilla Sky, I don't think it came up on this show because we didn't find it until Monday.

745
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:54,260
Actually, the Power of Harm manga was the exact same story they were going to use for the DDR movie, so I'm thinking that, uh, people bought the story for the DDR movie and go,

746
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:57,960
Well, let's just put it within the other Bomani game. They're never going to know the difference.

747
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,460
So, back to your week and your day.

748
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:13,460
I'm still waiting for Battle Royale Volume 3 to be out, and I haven't had a chance to go by Kinokuniya to pick up the others that I'm missing.

749
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:20,460
So, apart from that, I decided that I'm going to start picking up another manga series after I'm done with Battle Royale.

750
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:26,460
And that's Berserk, which is still going and very expensive, but I don't care. And that's really about it.

751
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:29,460
Spent lots of time with my boy.

752
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:33,460
Loki, we haven't heard much from you this show. Hey, chat room, no flooding.

753
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:37,460
Alright, you're getting kicked.

754
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:41,460
Every last one of you.

755
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:45,460
Loki, we haven't heard much from you yet this show. What's up?

756
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:49,460
I've eaten too much rice. I had two bowls of rice. I should have known better than that.

757
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:53,460
But, I didn't do anything this week.

758
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:57,460
And, just kind of hung out.

759
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:06,520
Got a costume for Halloween, wore the costume for Halloween, and was working on my pads,

760
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:09,420
or not my pads, my cabinet was working on it.

761
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,560
I was going to finish it, or well not really finish it,

762
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,240
but start actually putting it together today.

763
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:20,420
But then I realized my measurements were off because the plans called for 5 eighths

764
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:26,160
of an inch MDF to be used when I was using 3 quarters of an inch MDF.

765
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:31,540
So I have to readjust some, but at least it's, you know, trimming down pieces, not, you know,

766
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:36,700
not screwing myself over with pieces being too short, so that's always good.

767
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,400
Still a pain in the ass.

768
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:43,760
And then, I don't know, not too much other stuff has been going on.

769
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:51,020
Just been sitting at home and stuff inside because it's cold out and went

770
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:55,640
down the golf lane yesterday and I was okay and stupid people there.

771
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:19,640
I don't know, not much, you'd think I'd be playing Castlevania since I bought it, but no I'm not, because I don't care, and thought about playing Zelda today but never actually got to play Zelda today, and I don't know, just broke waiting for more money, that's about it.

772
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:26,160
My week was interesting because I was on vacation this week

773
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,040
and originally my plan was to go to West Hollywood for Halloween.

774
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,100
Because, you know, I want to be with my people on Halloween.

775
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,800
But it didn't end up happening.

776
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:37,020
We decided to cancel the trip, mostly because of the fires that were going on in SoCal.

777
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,000
We kind of didn't want to end up in the middle of all of it.

778
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,620
My friend has really bad asthma and was afraid that the ash in the air might get to him.

779
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:45,440
Contacts as well, things like that.

780
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,220
And just some other stuff that came up.

781
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:49,420
So we ended up going on the trip.

782
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:53,180
So I've kind of just been having a lazy vacation.

783
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:55,300
I've just been sitting on my big butt.

784
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,340
I literally think I've gained three pounds while on this

785
00:52:58,340 --> 00:52:59,680
vacation, and I don't care.

786
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:05,520
Because I've kind of just needed it, I think, because

787
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,180
I've been working really hard nonstop for the

788
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:08,000
past couple months.

789
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,020
And it's going to be crazy.

790
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,180
This holiday season right up until Christmas is going to be

791
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:11,900
really crazy.

792
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,700
I'm just not going to have any time for anything.

793
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:17,300
So I'm kind of glad I kind of got a little vacation before I

794
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:17,860
have to go back.

795
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,880
Sometimes a vacation can be taken in your living room.

796
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,560
And I played a lot of Final Fantasy XI.

797
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,920
I'll talk about Final Fantasy XI a little later in the show,

798
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,600
much to Jamie's dislike.

799
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,000
But she'll just have to deal with it.

800
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,160
It means I have to buy a new freaking graphics card

801
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:33,960
if I want to get it.

802
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:36,060
I don't feel like spending the money on it.

803
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,540
When Ragnarok is hitting me just fine.

804
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:43,860
So that was pretty much my week and my day.

805
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,640
Today not a whole lot going on.

806
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,340
and I've just been sleeping in, I try to get myself back

807
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:52,000
on a regular sleep schedule because I've got to get

808
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,940
up early and go back to work tomorrow, so I don't want

809
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,840
to be on too crazy of a sleep schedule because I don't want

810
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,320
to be an irritable bitch tomorrow.

811
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:00,580
That's pretty much it.

812
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,140
Oh, at least you're not going in for the 5.30 shift.

813
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,940
No, but I am going in a half hour early tomorrow,

814
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:09,340
which means we're going in at 7, which for me is early,

815
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:10,040
so we'll see.

816
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:11,580
I think we work the same shift.

817
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,900
I work 7.30 to 4 usually.

818
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:15,900
Oh, 7.30, 4.30.

819
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:19,740
I only take a half for lunch.

820
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:23,660
I have something to tell you later though, which might be interesting.

821
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:26,780
Oh really? Yes, my work is moving in a few months.

822
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:30,420
Oh, to near me? To the area I used to work in.

823
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:33,940
Oh, okay. That's cool. Cool deal.

824
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:38,780
Okay, well I think we're going to do this break is we're going to

825
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:41,860
take another break actually right now and then we're going to come back and we

826
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:44,580
actually have some Bahmani things to talk about so we'll do that.

827
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:49,100
We have the cage match still, the FUs of the week, of course, all that fun stuff.

828
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,300
What do you want to hear?

829
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,600
Talk about the break.

830
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,440
Okay, we're going to, since we did a TAC break last time, I think what we're going

831
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,960
to do this time is we'll take a TAC break.

832
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:00,760
Won't that be fun?

833
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:07,940
Yay. So, we'll be back and some Bomani news to talk about, among other things.

834
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:15,620
Join our chat room, www.calibomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on Chat.

835
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,820
And while I look for the MP3, I want this break.

836
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:24,580
I think that later on during the show, though, we need to do a break of another's.

837
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:26,640
We could do that.

838
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:27,780
We could.

839
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:30,980
Because, you know, I'm really, really, really, sometimes today,

840
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:32,860
wanting to hear leading cyber another.

841
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:34,480
We'll see if we can arrange that.

842
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:41,480
Alright, we're going to take a break with some Taka music and we will be back.

843
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:09,480
Yeah.

844
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:14,480
Yeah.

845
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:19,480
Yeah.

846
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:24,480
Yeah.

847
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:29,480
Yeah.

848
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,480
You

849
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,480
You

850
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:14,480
Maybe they've seen us, and welcome us all So many like you to all, and things to be found

851
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:19,480
I'm still not alone, it turns out

852
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:22,480
The final countdown

853
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:28,480
The final countdown

854
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:39,480
Orange Lounge Radio. We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

855
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:49,480
Howdy. We're back. Did you miss us?

856
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:55,480
Orange Lounge Radio episode number 67. We're in the middle of it right now.

857
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,000
right now.

858
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,600
Yeah, and it's gooey and sticky.

859
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,120
Big station news.

860
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,640
Big, big station news.

861
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:08,400
There's a lot of shit coming to the station in November.

862
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:13,560
First off, this Wednesday is the return of Live Wire.

863
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:15,240
So you better be listening, because we don't want

864
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,240
Loki to have another fit.

865
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,180
But no, if you're not listening, you're seriously

866
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:20,640
missing out, because it's some good stuff.

867
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,200
Oh, if you're not listening, you're a poopy head.

868
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:22,680
That's right.

869
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:26,840
you're missing out on live mixing of dance, trance, and sometimes,

870
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:28,840
sometimes once in a while, a bimani song.

871
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,480
Of dance, trance, and antsy?

872
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,920
Is there anything you want to say about Loki?

873
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,340
He's too busy thumbing through my Final Fantasy XI manual.

874
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:37,020
No, he says no.

875
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:37,820
Isn't, oh.

876
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:39,340
Loki, you're being awfully quiet tonight.

877
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:40,040
Is everything okay?

878
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:40,860
Are you feeling all right?

879
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:41,720
I have a headache.

880
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:43,180
Aww, he has a headache.

881
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:44,100
Do you want some?

882
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:44,720
You want some new bread?

883
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,060
Advil?

884
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:46,680
Mine is just outside.

885
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:47,500
Oh, it's outside.

886
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:52,440
So we have Livewire returning on Wednesday.

887
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:56,780
This week, by the way, this week and one week only, Vanilla Sky

888
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:58,460
and Pump Up the Volume are changing nights.

889
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,420
So Pump Up the Volume will be on Monday.

890
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:02,100
Vanilla Sky will be on Tuesday.

891
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:02,660
Just so you know.

892
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:06,040
And I'm probably going to be away from the computer quite a bit.

893
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:06,820
Don't tell them that.

894
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:07,480
Well, no.

895
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,980
But that has to do with Jamie's trip because she's leaving on Tuesday.

896
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:12,040
Yeah, because I actually, I packed today.

897
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:13,340
My clothes are packed today.

898
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:13,520
Oh, okay, cool.

899
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,560
I just have, you know, my other little things to pack.

900
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:20,580
But, and I'm hoping that people actually make requests this time around.

901
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:25,220
And lots of people listen, make it a good show for me because I won't be able to do it

902
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:27,680
for two weeks, but you get to hear old shows.

903
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:33,880
But apart from that, you know, listen, request.

904
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:41,800
Also coming to the station in November, something that you guys have been asking me

905
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:46,420
about for a long time, Sunday, November 23rd, mark your calendars,

906
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:51,560
Sunday, November 23rd is season four, excuse me, of Orange Lounge Radio,

907
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,860
the debut, and that's going to be Jamie's return, because she'll be back

908
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:59,180
from Alabama, and it's episode number 70, and that is when the station

909
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:01,480
is going to go to MP3 Pro.

910
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:08,600
Depending on Live 365's setup, we may or may not be able to have the live

911
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:13,400
shows an MP3 Pro, but our Bahmani Music Amor program will be an MP3 Pro. For those who

912
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:18,880
don't know what MP3 Pro is, we'll have details on our website at that point about how you

913
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:23,680
can get DSL quality sound over your modem connection with MP3 Pro. It's very cool.

914
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:28,080
Why are you being so biased? What about cable quality?

915
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:35,160
Okay, cable, highest, and better quality, because life uses five buttons that is DSL

916
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,160
quality.

917
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,160
I'm teasing.

918
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,160
Way better quality. How about this?

919
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:42,720
Broadband Quality Radio over your modem.

920
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,800
That would be great.

921
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:45,880
Oh, I had the ferret in the air.

922
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:49,720
And also, just before Jamie gets back from break, we will

923
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:51,640
be setting the ferrets on fire live.

924
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:53,480
No!

925
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:56,520
I will hide the ferrets.

926
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:59,320
Hey, babies.

927
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:02,000
The ferrets love me here.

928
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,400
Look, don't kill the babies.

929
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,880
You fat murderer!

930
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,520
You're going to have to take them to Alabama with you if

931
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,560
You don't want them to die.

932
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:12,680
You are anti-ferret.

933
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:16,600
I think that's all the news for now, coming up to the station soon.

934
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:17,600
Yeah, you're right.

935
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:18,600
I'm anti-ferret.

936
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:22,280
There is one other thing.

937
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:29,080
I was hoping tonight we would have new Papa Music 10 MP3s to debut for you because we've

938
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:32,480
gotten the connection to get the music for it.

939
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:36,120
There is some great stuff on the Papa Music 10 soundtrack, honestly.

940
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:37,900
I know a lot of people have always been kind of,

941
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:40,320
pop and music stuff's kind of cheesy, things like that.

942
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:43,200
But seriously, there's some good shit on pop and music 10.

943
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,560
And you guys have to hear it.

944
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:50,480
For instance, Tack doing a duet with Desrow.

945
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:51,900
Oh, God.

946
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:52,900
Very interesting.

947
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:54,440
It sounds a lot like Distress.

948
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,960
That would just make me so.

949
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:00,920
Tacko with a new trance song and he got together with somebody

950
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,560
and I can't fucking remember who it was.

951
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:03,160
I apologize.

952
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,560
I'll have to see when I get the soundtrack.

953
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:12,160
And then, this is the greatest one of all, Mr. T doing Goonies Are Good Enough.

954
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,160
Cool.

955
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:16,640
It is the coolest thing I've ever heard in a Bobondi game in my life.

956
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,400
I cannot wait.

957
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,960
So I can't wait.

958
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:22,960
That's going to be great.

959
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,800
And I'm still looking for a attack.

960
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:34,400
What I'm thinking is maybe Thursday or so we'll have like a Pop and Music 10 debut special.

961
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:40,600
will be pre-taped. It won't be a live thing. Just some music so you guys can hear it.

962
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,600
That's going to be awesome.

963
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:46,600
I still remember being all happy about hearing the Yamato theme.

964
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:50,600
Yeah, the Yamato theme from Pop'n Music. Maybe we'll play some Pop'n Music MV3s later.

965
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:53,600
And the Lum song.

966
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,400
Yeah, that song?

967
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,400
The Lum theme song.

968
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,400
Oh, okay.

969
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:04,400
the

970
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:11,700
so hopefully we'll have those pop music ten mps for you soon

971
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:12,720
uh...

972
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:16,740
there's also the trial freaks uh... new music that's out to but uh... i don't

973
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:19,540
know if there's anything on our land right now maybe we'll be able to get to

974
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:21,560
a later in the show we'll see

975
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:25,740
i still need to be more home versions of the guitar freaks games

976
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:26,900
I do too.

977
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:31,340
You know, I have a freaking drum mania controller and two guitar freaks controllers

978
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:33,020
and no session.

979
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:36,400
No new sessions for me.

980
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,940
And they need to figure out how to get keyboard mania to work with it too.

981
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:42,480
I agree.

982
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,720
My poor

983
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,000
dust collected

984
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,980
keyboard mania.

985
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:51,100
I haven't played keyboard mania. I never even did bother to buy second and third.

986
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:54,400
Oh yeah, second and third did better than the first one.

987
01:07:54,400 --> 01:08:01,280
You know what's nice? What's nice is I'll finally be able to dust off my 2DX controller because they have the

988
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:04,860
signatures they needed or whatever to get the

989
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:06,820
get the new

990
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:08,440
consumer style made.

991
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:13,680
Well, I'm hoping that if I have the money available I might just

992
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:17,880
when they do the new arcade style controller release

993
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:22,960
just breaking down and ordering mine through Himea.

994
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:29,360
I'm hoping that in the new 2DX consumer style that they have every Konami original from

995
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:30,360
7th, 8th, and 9th style.

996
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:31,680
That would be so beautiful.

997
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:32,680
I'd cry.

998
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:34,960
That would be pretty cool.

999
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:39,480
And you know, now that we've seen DDR Extreme, we know that Konami is willing to put 100

1000
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:41,160
plus songs in a home mix.

1001
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:46,560
So there's no reason why they can't do DDR without it.

1002
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:51,920
And then they need to put TAC in a box and ship them to my house.

1003
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:54,920
It can mix for me all day at gunpoint.

1004
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:58,920
Well, let's see some other news going on right now in the Bamani world.

1005
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,920
I wanted to read this for you guys.

1006
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,920
I've got to pull up the story, though.

1007
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,920
Jamie, feel time.

1008
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:12,920
Hey, I hear it.

1009
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:13,920
You know what?

1010
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:14,920
What?

1011
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:16,920
I'm sitting on the floor, and I don't know why.

1012
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,920
Why are you sitting on the floor tonight?

1013
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:23,440
and it's not in front of the camera.

1014
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:25,480
I can hide here effectively.

1015
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:29,600
Not many places I can hide effectively from the webcam.

1016
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:31,560
Actually, yeah, there are.

1017
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:32,360
There are plenty of places.

1018
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:32,960
All right.

1019
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,640
Here's what I wanted to get into.

1020
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:40,420
The song list is released for DDRXBox, also, DDR UltraMix,

1021
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:42,520
because a lot of us have been calling it DDRXBox.

1022
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:46,240
The full song list is out, and so I thought we'd go over it

1023
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:49,100
and get your guys' reactions to the songs that are on it.

1024
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:49,940
What do you guys think?

1025
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:51,320
Loki, you with us?

1026
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:52,680
Okay, cool.

1027
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:54,400
0.59 by DJ Taka.

1028
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,800
We.

1029
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:59,080
Absolute, The Cuff N' Stuff It Mix by Thuggy D,

1030
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:01,060
which would pretty much be Scotty D.

1031
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:03,140
That's stupid.

1032
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:03,980
What?

1033
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:05,640
It sounds kind of stupid, the name.

1034
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:08,760
Yeah, The Cuff N' Stuff It Mix sounds a little,

1035
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:09,920
I'm worried because I'm wondering

1036
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,360
if it's gonna be like a rap version of Absolute, you know?

1037
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:13,200
Okay, that would suit.

1038
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1039
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:18,980
That would suck more than anything has sucked before.

1040
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:20,560
Except for that, don't move.

1041
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:23,400
I'm going to, I'm going to just have high hopes.

1042
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:28,740
Hi, we're still here.

1043
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:38,120
Also on DDR UltraMix, after the game of love, notice it's not after the game,

1044
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:42,680
but because Xbox will be a little more scandalous, they're going with after the game of love.

1045
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:52,200
A new transplant song from 2DX, Ballad For You is going to be an ultra mix, that should

1046
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,200
be interesting.

1047
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:57,800
But it's Thomas Howard, so all you Thomas Howard fanboys and girls will be...

1048
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:01,480
That is not a good Thomas Howard song.

1049
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:03,440
Like it or not, there it is.

1050
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:07,440
Candy Heart will be in the new DDR.

1051
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:10,240
Can't Stop Following in Love, the speed mix by Naoki.

1052
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:11,800
Oh yay, speed mix.

1053
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:18,240
A new license song, Castles in the Sky, Ian Van Dowell featuring Marsha, will be a song

1054
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,240
in Xbox.

1055
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:20,240
Marsha, Marsha, Marsha!

1056
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:23,800
We'll play that for you later in the show if we have time.

1057
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:24,800
Does it suck?

1058
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:25,800
It's pretty good.

1059
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:26,800
I like it.

1060
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,560
It's on the same par as Will I in Max 2.

1061
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:34,080
I think I like Will I a little bit more, but Castles in the Sky is not bad.

1062
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,560
Dive by B4U.

1063
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:38,680
Oh, the joy.

1064
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:43,660
Do That Thing by Masai, that's another licensed song, I've never heard this song.

1065
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:45,300
What's That Thing?

1066
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:50,300
It's Do That Thang, with an A, it's a thang, not a thing but a thang.

1067
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:55,140
Is that like Thing's cousin thang, you know like a foot that comes out of a box?

1068
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:58,260
The thang, you know it's the new thang.

1069
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:00,820
Drop the Bomb, the System SF remix.

1070
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:03,140
Oh Joy, Oh Rapture.

1071
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:05,140
DXY by Tack.

1072
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:07,520
Electro-Tuned by Tack.

1073
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,520
Exotic ethnic by revengee.

1074
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,020
Oh, yay.

1075
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:15,240
Uh... healing vision by desire. At least it's not the stupid angelic mix.

1076
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:22,240
What? You don't like the angelic mix?

1077
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:26,560
The angelic mix is like one of my favorite remixes of any DDR song ever.

1078
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:30,680
The angelic mix gives me a splitting headache every time I listen to it.

1079
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:34,800
Is it just the beep? Take the beep out though and it's a beautiful remix. That's okay, I still like the original better.

1080
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,120
You are weird.

1081
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:41,440
Hypnotic Crisis by the Blue Destroyers, that should be interesting.

1082
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:48,260
My First Cata, Hysteria by Naoki190, because you have to have your generic Konami trying

1083
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:50,420
to do rap song.

1084
01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:55,500
Another transplant from 2DX, and this is a really good one in my opinion, Infinite Prayer

1085
01:12:55,500 --> 01:13:00,340
by LED, and what's most interesting about that is I had heard rumors that LED had left

1086
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:04,740
Konami, I don't know if they're true or not, but if I'm not mistaken we haven't had any

1087
01:13:04,740 --> 01:13:07,180
new LED songs in a while, but kind of interesting.

1088
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:08,660
Infinite Prayer is going to be in DDR.

1089
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:10,340
Which mix, is this the standard?

1090
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:11,380
It's the standard.

1091
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:13,980
Wouldn't it be cool if they put the floating block in?

1092
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:15,860
Because that's my favorite mix of that.

1093
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:16,700
It would be nice.

1094
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:18,860
And there are still 10 unlocked, so you never know.

1095
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:21,260
But this is the original that's going to be in it.

1096
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:24,620
But the original original was, if I'm not mistaken, was a

1097
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:26,260
club mix song before it was a 2DX song.

1098
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:28,820
I think so.

1099
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:32,500
Insertion, the Machine Gun Kelly mix, a remix of

1100
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:36,460
of insertion by Thuggy D. So we can look forward to a wrap

1101
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:37,420
mix of insertion.

1102
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:39,660
That should be interesting.

1103
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:41,920
But that might be kind of good, because there's a lot of

1104
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,260
good rap out there about insertion.

1105
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:48,020
Oh, by the way, that's something else I need to do.

1106
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:49,780
Oh, I'm going to stick my what?

1107
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:51,340
I need to bring up something after the list.

1108
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:53,460
All right.

1109
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:59,060
Keep on moving the DMX mix by NMR Type G. It's kind of new,

1110
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:00,500
very interesting.

1111
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,780
It's not new, says Loki.

1112
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:03,740
Where is it from?

1113
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:06,140
It's from Dance Maniacs.

1114
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:07,340
Oh.

1115
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:08,180
Oh, I'll be damned.

1116
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:09,060
It sure is.

1117
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:10,580
My bad.

1118
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:13,380
My bad.

1119
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:15,220
Oh, maybe we'll have to listen to that later.

1120
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:18,340
Keep Your Body Movin' by Thuggy D. It's a new Konami

1121
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:19,620
original there.

1122
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:21,140
Thuggy D.

1123
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:22,340
Oh, you have it?

1124
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:24,660
Are we going to hear it?

1125
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:27,580
OK, so this is a little bit of Keep On Movin' the DMX mix.

1126
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:29,940
Just a little clip.

1127
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:31,940
I'm curious how different this is in the original.

1128
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:51,940
It's kinda ghetto. I don't think I like it. Whatever. Turn this shit off.

1129
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:54,940
It sounds like a bad another.

1130
01:14:54,940 --> 01:15:00,940
God, I'm a stupid asshole. DMX mix, of course, that means dance maniacs mix. God, I'm a tard.

1131
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:02,940
You do know some rap mix. Call the truth.

1132
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:08,940
Kind Lady by Okiatos. We all know Kind Lady. It's been in every DDR mix.

1133
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:09,940
We need the 80s one.

1134
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:14,940
I like Kind Lady, too. I'm glad it's there. La Senorita Virtual by T.M.E.

1135
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:16,940
The worst version of that song.

1136
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:21,940
I've heard much worse DDR mixes than La Senorita Virtual.

1137
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:23,940
I never really cared for that one.

1138
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:26,940
OK.

1139
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:30,780
Also going to be in DDR UltraMix will be Let the Beat Hit Em,

1140
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:34,300
classic R&B style, because it's just not DDR without some

1141
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:35,860
crappy mix of Let the Beat Hit Em.

1142
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:38,900
You know that the only version of that one I really liked was

1143
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:41,100
the one that was in Max.

1144
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:42,380
I think that's it.

1145
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:42,980
That's the one.

1146
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:44,740
Then that's the good one.

1147
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:47,220
Let's Talk It Over.

1148
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:48,780
That's decent.

1149
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:51,620
Look to the Sky, the True Color mix.

1150
01:15:51,620 --> 01:16:07,420
Love to Me, the disco mix, by Yamato, On the Jazz, Overblast by LED Light, Paranoia Eternal,

1151
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:13,700
the fan written Paranoia, A New Transplant, new to DDR UltraMix, Quickening by DJ Taka,

1152
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:20,320
that's a very cool one, a licensed song, this will be a lot of fun, Paul Oakenfold with

1153
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:24,880
Ready Steady Go. I don't know the song but... Hey, I have the CD. It's on my CD. Oh, cool.

1154
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:31,160
It's like the first track I think on the Buka CD. Maybe we'll get to that song later. Santa

1155
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:37,040
Melente Nante, of course, a fan favorite. Togo Project featuring Sana. That'll be good.

1156
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:43,960
Secret Rendezvous by the Divas. Ooh. Sexy Planet by Crystal Aliens. Kind of one of those

1157
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:48,220
songs that a lot of people thought we wouldn't see because American audiences can't handle

1158
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:54,180
the word sex. It's Sensual Planet. It's Sensual Planet, but believe it or not it is coming

1159
01:16:54,180 --> 01:17:01,740
to DDR UltraMix. This is the licensed song I'm most excited about. Shiny Disco Balls

1160
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:07,220
by Huda Funk. I love this song. I can't wait to play it. I've never heard it. Late night,

1161
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:10,900
rock and roll fellas. Oh, we're going to hear a little clip of Shiny Disco Balls right here.

1162
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:17,900
here. Can we hear a clip of it? I'm not hearing it. Get to the lyrics. We're skipping around

1163
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:29,620
the mp3 a little bit. This is an extended mix of the song. I love this song. It's really

1164
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:33,620
I love this song. It's really repetitive, but I love it.

1165
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:38,620
Ready, steady, go is better, stop doing this.

1166
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:41,620
Anyway, that'll be fun.

1167
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:44,620
So In Love by Caramel S.

1168
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:46,620
Okay.

1169
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:48,620
That'll be in Dior Ultra Mix.

1170
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:51,620
Superstar, DJ Rich featuring Tell Brothers.

1171
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:54,620
God, has there been a home mix that Superstar was not on?

1172
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:58,620
Sweet, Sweet Heart Magic.

1173
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:02,620
The Heart Magic, by June.

1174
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:04,620
The Earth Light, by L.E.D. Light.

1175
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:06,620
That's cool.

1176
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:09,620
A new Konami original by ThuggyD, once again.

1177
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:12,620
There For You.

1178
01:18:12,620 --> 01:18:14,620
That should be interesting.

1179
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:17,620
Trip Machine, The Love Mix, by 2MB.

1180
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:18,620
The Love Mix.

1181
01:18:18,620 --> 01:18:20,620
And lastly...

1182
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:21,620
Yes, Logie?

1183
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:22,620
Go ahead.

1184
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:25,620
Lastly, Tsugaru, Revenge vs. Desire.

1185
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:26,620
Yes, Logie.

1186
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:29,100
one that they didn't put on there, but it's going to be an unlock.

1187
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:31,740
Mind Parasite from Dance Maniacs is going to be on there.

1188
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:35,880
Also, Colors is rumored to be in the game as well.

1189
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:39,060
Now, this is the interesting thing is don't forget there's ten unlocks,

1190
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:46,760
but also DDR UltraMix is going to have the pay for new songs feature,

1191
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:47,640
which is going to be interesting.

1192
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:51,240
And this is what I've heard, this is what's come off of DDR Freak.

1193
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:57,120
I read in some post by Order of Chaos, who's the producer for DDR UltraMix, said something

1194
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:06,940
about five songs, $5. What do you guys think? Is this a good idea for DDR? Shitty idea?

1195
01:19:06,940 --> 01:19:13,540
Only ten unlocks this time, but five songs, $5. What do you think, Loki?

1196
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:18,400
That's fine, I'm sure, because it's obviously going to download to the hard drive. So whenever

1197
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:22,040
If there's a transfer of files, there'll be a way to pirate the songs anyways.

1198
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:25,240
And it doesn't matter anyways, because someone's going to buy it for five bucks.

1199
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:26,760
Put the same files online, I'll give it a free.

1200
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:33,840
They apparently have forgotten about the little device called the Xbox GameShark, and people

1201
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:34,840
with laptops.

1202
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:38,600
Who can save those files to their laptops?

1203
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:42,640
All illegality aside, let's assume we played by the legal way here.

1204
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:43,640
What do you guys think of it?

1205
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:46,360
That's five dollars I could get a sandwich with.

1206
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:47,360
That's only five bucks.

1207
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:50,800
I mean, I throw $5 down for lunch, so, you know,

1208
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,960
I eat at home one day, I get five songs.

1209
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:56,480
As long as they're not shit, because I can see it being,

1210
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,280
like, utter shit that they're going to put on there,

1211
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:00,460
but if it was good stuff, yeah.

1212
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:05,540
Let them move, the Let Them Move remix, the, you know,

1213
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:09,520
like, Forever Sunshine.

1214
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:14,520
They have like a set of five that's all newt remixes.

1215
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:22,400
Yes, they're going to have a pack with Forever Sunshine and Let Them Move and God, what else

1216
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:25,960
is DDR song no one likes?

1217
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:26,960
Crash.

1218
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:27,960
Crash.

1219
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:28,960
Thank you.

1220
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:30,400
And more B For You songs.

1221
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:36,680
And then an original with Yoko Ono.

1222
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:42,420
bag for you the Thuggy D remix. Yes, it'll be bagged for you by Thuggy D.

1223
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:48,420
Featuring, um, what's-her-face from, from, uh, you know the song that used to be in DDR?

1224
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:49,520
What? Shit.

1225
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:53,920
Shit? I don't know that song. Panorama.

1226
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:57,860
You know what's interesting about this mix? You know what I'm just noticing that is very

1227
01:20:57,860 --> 01:21:02,920
interesting about this mix? There is only one song in this entire mix that has Polteri

1228
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:10,800
in it I'm thinking I'm thinking one of those expansion packs I'm gonna call it

1229
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,680
right here one of those expansion packs is gonna be five now keep featuring

1230
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:19,020
Polteri songs god help I'm gonna bet you anything that's anything I don't people

1231
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:23,200
there's people who like yes there are people there's people who can't sing

1232
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:27,480
there's people who come to this show on Monday nights this week Tuesday who like

1233
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:32,600
voluntary so there are people out there who like voluntary but I just think that

1234
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:39,680
you're saying you know I was feeling to be in in a shitty DDR song I forgot

1235
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:48,520
about when was all coming out again when was this coming out ultra mix is out

1236
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:49,520
I don't know.

1237
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:50,520
I'm out November.

1238
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:51,520
Sometime this month.

1239
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:52,520
I don't remember the date.

1240
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:53,520
I think the 18th.

1241
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:54,520
The 18th.

1242
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:55,520
We'll see.

1243
01:21:55,520 --> 01:22:00,520
I want to get an Xbox anyway, so we'll see.

1244
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:02,520
Hold this for a second.

1245
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:03,520
I'll find out.

1246
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:04,520
You're weak.

1247
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:07,520
Oh, Jamie's going to make a phone call.

1248
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,520
Actually, somebody in our chat room will probably post it.

1249
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:13,520
But Jamie's going to get an official word.

1250
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:14,520
Yeah, it's in the same.

1251
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:15,520
Oh, hello.

1252
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,520
It's in the same post as the song list.

1253
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:18,760
Thank you.

1254
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,960
It is the November 18th.

1255
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:33,620
So also rumored to be in the mix that we haven't seen any

1256
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:37,040
proof of yet, but Metal Gear Solid 2, the

1257
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,360
theme, I think it is.

1258
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:42,880
Or maybe it's that mix from Six Mix.

1259
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:43,960
That would be awesome.

1260
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:46,660
Very cool.

1261
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:50,560
Do you have that Paul Logan-fold song? Do you want to play a little bit of that?

1262
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:53,560
Oh, you don't have that one? What about the other one that was in there? There was another one we said we want to play.

1263
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:55,820
Oh, Castles in the Sky, I have that one.

1264
01:22:55,820 --> 01:22:58,960
You have that?

1265
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:03,420
Let's race and see who can pull it up first.

1266
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:07,260
This is really good radio. I know, this is great radio. Loki and I are having a race right now.

1267
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:09,620
By the way, I vouch for chloroceptic.

1268
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:13,100
It really works. Okay, got it.

1269
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:20,100
Here's Castles in the Sky.

1270
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:37,620
That's Castles in the Sky if you're curious.

1271
01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:39,060
It sounds pretty typical.

1272
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:47,380
Yeah, it sounds very much like Will I. I prefer Will I to that song, but I heard a rumor that

1273
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:52,740
the steps were going to be insane to that song, so we'll see. They might have some really

1274
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:55,300
good original steps to that.

1275
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:58,020
I have a little bit of news.

1276
01:23:58,020 --> 01:23:59,020
Oh, really?

1277
01:23:59,020 --> 01:24:00,700
Have you read anything on Yahoo?

1278
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:02,680
Give me your news.

1279
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:09,160
Now the FCC has said that it is okay to say fuck on national television.

1280
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:10,400
What? Really?

1281
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:14,080
As long as it is not used to describe fucking.

1282
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:21,320
That's the same way, you know what, that's the same rule you can use to say the word fuck in a PG-13 movie.

1283
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:24,240
You can't say asshole, but you can say ass.

1284
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:26,320
Sweet.

1285
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:30,000
So now you can say fuck on TV, I can't wait for next week's South Park.

1286
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,500
if this is fucking annoying, or this is fucking stupid, or fuck him, or...

1287
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:37,000
I cannot wait for next week's South Park.

1288
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:42,000
But yeah, and that all came up, I think it was someone who was accepting an award,

1289
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:47,000
they go, well this is fucking awesome, and the FCC got a bunch of letters,

1290
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:54,000
and they were like, well, he didn't actually say that, like, I'm going to go fuck this person, so...

1291
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:01,000
I'm going to go home and fuck my wife!

1292
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:04,400
Chat room's itching for us to get our cage match on.

1293
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,620
What do you guys think? Let's do it.

1294
01:25:06,620 --> 01:25:08,240
Alright, let's do it.

1295
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:10,000
I didn't have to think of one this week.

1296
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:15,520
Yeah, I know you got saved this week. Let's do the orange launch cage match tonight, shall we?

1297
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,000
You know what sucks?

1298
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,800
What? I think I deleted Holic off my computer.

1299
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:23,440
That's okay, I know it's on Loki's, I can get it through there.

1300
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:30,440
How dare you delete any tax? I had to delete so much stuff. Buy a hard drive! To make room for Final Fantasy XI is not even funny. Get a hard drive!

1301
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,920
That's alright, we have Holly. You know what?

1302
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:38,060
I have a 120 gig hard drive.

1303
01:25:38,060 --> 01:25:40,640
And I've used um...

1304
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:44,380
50 of it.

1305
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:47,340
I need to start burning off stuff off of my hard drive.

1306
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:50,260
Alright, ready? Because I'm lazy.

1307
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:53,860
from the Orange Launch Cage Match.

1308
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:58,180
Last week in the Cage Match, Jamie won the Cage Match.

1309
01:25:58,180 --> 01:26:01,180
And her song was, do you want to introduce it?

1310
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:03,620
It was Little Flower

1311
01:26:03,620 --> 01:26:07,100
by CyberX featuring Rapina, wasn't it?

1312
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:08,300
I think it was.

1313
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:11,020
And it won by quite a landslide.

1314
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:15,940
So will it win by a landslide again tonight? I don't know, we'll see. The way the Cage Match works,

1315
01:26:15,940 --> 01:26:17,920
the three of us are going to pick a song

1316
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,840
and you're going to pick your favorite.

1317
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:22,360
And your favorite, determined by your votes,

1318
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:23,680
that are sent to me in the chat room

1319
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:25,080
once we've done playing all three songs.

1320
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:27,820
Your vote will determine what song goes into rotation

1321
01:26:27,820 --> 01:26:31,320
all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.

1322
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:32,600
So here it is, song number one

1323
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:33,500
that you can vote for tonight.

1324
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:35,120
Jamie's pick from last week, which one?

1325
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,360
And you only get to hear a clip of it

1326
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:37,720
because it is the winner.

1327
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:41,200
This is CyberX featuring Rapinoe with Little Flower.

1328
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:42,040
Enjoy.

1329
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:44,040
🎶🎶🎶

1330
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:44,040
Me

1331
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:54,040
I can't wait to see you in the next video!

1332
01:28:55,040 --> 01:29:08,040
I can't wait to see you in the next video!

1333
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:15,040
Konnazura gite mou keshite Akira nazuni

1334
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:20,040
You can't leave me without my love

1335
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:25,040
I'm not afraid of you

1336
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:30,040
I'm not afraid of you

1337
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:35,040
I'm not afraid of you

1338
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:40,040
I'm not afraid of you

1339
01:29:40,040 --> 01:30:08,440
All right, that was song number one, last week's winner, CyberX featuring Rapinoe with

1340
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:13,440
I forgot to put that in the chat room.

1341
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:15,480
Usually I announce what songs 1 and 2 are.

1342
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:19,080
So Jamie, tell us how wonderful that song is while I do that part.

1343
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:20,740
It's a 9.

1344
01:30:20,740 --> 01:30:21,740
It's chancy.

1345
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:22,740
No, no, no, no.

1346
01:30:22,740 --> 01:30:23,740
You already rated it last week.

1347
01:30:23,740 --> 01:30:25,580
You just have to go on about how great it is.

1348
01:30:25,580 --> 01:30:26,580
It's awesome.

1349
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:31,800
You really, really like the song because you already really seem to like trance.

1350
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:38,500
It doesn't get much trancier than that unless it's das Scrockenspiel which puts me in a

1351
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:41,420
trance every time I drive and I usually run into things.

1352
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:44,420
Alright, Loki insists I do his song next.

1353
01:30:44,420 --> 01:30:48,100
Oh, he's going to find it, well then I'm going to go next.

1354
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:53,580
My song I picked tonight, it's an older song, it's a few years old and actually those of

1355
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:57,020
you that listen to Understation Live on a regular basis may recognize this song because

1356
01:30:57,020 --> 01:31:00,820
I know it's one of Travis' favorite break songs, but I've just been really addicted

1357
01:31:00,820 --> 01:31:07,820
I think it would be awesome for DDR, in fact I'm gonna convince Loki to put it on his bootleg mix.

1358
01:31:07,820 --> 01:31:16,820
I love this song a lot, and I hope you guys do too. I really didn't have any other good choices for tonight so I picked a nice little poppy techno song for you guys.

1359
01:31:16,820 --> 01:31:18,820
I forgot to make a comment on chatroom.

1360
01:31:18,820 --> 01:31:25,820
OLK is not spelled with an H, it's OOKI if you're going by Papa Romaji. Thank you.

1361
01:31:25,820 --> 01:31:27,820
Well thank you for clarifying.

1362
01:31:27,820 --> 01:31:36,060
Now, back to Gage Match, the song I picked is Tina Cousins and it's called Mysterious

1363
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:37,060
Times.

1364
01:31:37,060 --> 01:31:39,060
Enjoy

1365
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:36,060
Life, a serious life, never moving around, dancing the rhythm of life.

1366
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:41,060
Time, mysterious time

1367
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:48,060
We're counting the hours and days till the end of all time

1368
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:53,060
We're feeling the change and we don't know why

1369
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:57,060
Choose one direction, just one more time

1370
01:32:58,060 --> 01:33:02,060
Don't say I'm thinking too much if you see what's behind

1371
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:06,060
And these are mysterious times

1372
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:13,060
Mysterious times

1373
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:20,060
No truth of my mind

1374
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:27,060
For this moment I feel like we live in mysterious times

1375
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:35,060
If you feel what's behind, these are mysterious times

1376
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:45,060
So, I feel my soul

1377
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:52,060
For this moment nobody could stop me from flying so high

1378
01:33:52,060 --> 01:34:05,060
Real, nothing is real In a war of illusion you only see what you

1379
01:34:05,060 --> 01:34:10,060
feel You're revealing the change and we don't

1380
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:15,060
know why Choose one direction, just one for time

1381
01:34:15,060 --> 01:34:20,060
Don't say I'm thinking too much if you see what's behind

1382
01:34:20,060 --> 01:34:24,060
And these are mysterious times

1383
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:31,060
Mysterious times

1384
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:38,060
The truth of our minds

1385
01:34:39,060 --> 01:34:45,060
For this moment I feel like we're living mysterious times

1386
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:52,060
If you see what's behind, these are mysterious times

1387
01:34:52,060 --> 01:35:17,300
Okay, that was song number two tonight, that was Tina Cousins with Mysterious Times.

1388
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:18,300
And what did y'all think, Jamie?

1389
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:26,300
Um, it was pretty good. It was, uh, kind of repetitive. I'm eating rice. I got good rice, too.

1390
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:28,800
It doesn't taste like minute rice, either.

1391
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:29,800
Um, but no.

1392
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:30,800
I know.

1393
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:34,300
It was okay. I give it an eight.

1394
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:36,300
Loki!

1395
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:40,800
It was okay. Seven.

1396
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:46,300
Um, I was kind of strapped for songs this week, so I know that's not the best I can do.

1397
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:54,300
But I still like it, I mean it's a perfect DDR song, it's so perfect for DDR, so I give it eight or nine, eight and a half.

1398
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:58,300
Alright, Loki, what's your pick for this week?

1399
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:05,300
My pick for this week is Cool and the Gang, and it's a song called Get Down On It.

1400
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:14,300
It's the DJ, Jewie Jams, I gotta get the full title here, what is it, Scrolls on Boy here.

1401
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:20,380
It's a Brute Lake remix by DJ Jimmy Jam, whatever that is.

1402
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:26,540
And it's Get Down On It in 2001 by Cool in the Gang.

1403
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:27,580
All right, let's try it out.

1404
01:36:27,580 --> 01:36:29,140
Here it is, Loki's pick for this week.

1405
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:36,140
Call the gang. Get down on it.

1406
01:38:29,140 --> 01:38:42,940
I say, people, whatcha gonna do?

1407
01:38:42,940 --> 01:38:48,620
You gotta get off the groove.

1408
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:55,940
Tell me, baby, how you gonna do it if you really don't wanna dance?

1409
01:38:55,940 --> 01:38:59,040
by standing on the wall.

1410
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:02,080
Tell me, are you going to do it if you really

1411
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:06,280
want to take a dance by standing on the wall?

1412
01:39:06,280 --> 01:39:08,240
Well, I heard all the music.

1413
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:10,380
Get down on it.

1414
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:12,280
Get down on it.

1415
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:13,760
Get down on it.

1416
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:14,760
Get down on it.

1417
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:15,760
Pull you down.

1418
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:17,240
Get down on it.

1419
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:19,240
Get down on it.

1420
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:21,240
Get down on it.

1421
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:22,240
Get down on it.

1422
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:24,240
Shalalalalala.

1423
01:39:24,240 --> 01:39:27,720
What you gon' do if you want to get out?

1424
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:39,720
What you gon' do if you back up off the wall?

1425
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:41,220
Hey, come on.

1426
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:14,740
Standing on the wall, get your back up, up, up.

1427
01:40:14,740 --> 01:40:17,060
Tell me, baby, how you gonna do it

1428
01:40:17,060 --> 01:40:18,560
if you really go take a chance?

1429
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:22,160
By standing on the wall, get your back up, up, up.

1430
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:26,740
Listen, baby, you know it when you're dancing, yeah.

1431
01:40:26,740 --> 01:40:30,740
You show it when you move, move, move.

1432
01:40:30,740 --> 01:40:34,540
You know it when you'r dancing, yeah.

1433
01:40:34,540 --> 01:40:38,460
You show it as you go across the block.

1434
01:40:38,460 --> 01:40:40,240
Get down on it.

1435
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:14,240
If you really want it, you got to feel it.

1436
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:16,240
Get down on it.

1437
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:20,240
Come on and get down on it.

1438
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:23,240
While you're dancing, get down on it.

1439
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:25,240
Get down on it.

1440
01:41:25,240 --> 01:41:26,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1441
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:28,240
Oh, yeah.

1442
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:31,240
You can do me, baby, when you move.

1443
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:34,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1444
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:36,240
Get down on it.

1445
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:39,240
Get down on it.

1446
01:41:39,240 --> 01:41:42,240
What you gon' do, if you wanna get out?

1447
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:44,240
I wonder if they're gonna do it for me?

1450
01:42:42,220 --> 01:42:44,700

1452
01:42:47,180 --> 01:42:51,700
seven point five for nostalgic coolness

i give it a nine because it's like the second song that's on my cd that i'm listening to right now

1454
01:42:55,820 --> 01:43:02,200

1456
01:43:04,020 --> 01:43:05,360

1460
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:18,140
I didn't like it. Deal with it.

1461
01:43:18,140 --> 01:43:21,120
Cool in the Gang is usually good.

1462
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:24,780
Cool in the Gang is usually good. That just wasn't good.

1463
01:43:24,780 --> 01:43:27,180
And what if it was Jungle Boogie?

1464
01:43:27,180 --> 01:43:30,280

01:44:41,940 --> 01:44:43,620
going on in the Sim world this week

1480
01:44:43,620 --> 01:44:45,300
that's worth talking about?

1481
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:47,300
Uh, no.

1482
01:44:47,300 --> 01:44:51,300
I have my beeps. I apologize. If you guys... Oh, sorry.

1483
01:44:51,300 --> 01:44:55,300
If you guys are hearing beeps over the air, I apologize. I don't...

1484
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:59,300
They're not turned off for some reason. They got turned back on, so just deal with it.

1485
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:08,300
Um, no. Nothing really going on, unless you count, like, turning makes fourth plus, but, uh, no.

1486
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:12,300
Yeah, why don't you turn it off, you lazy bastard?

1487
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:16,020
What do I turn it off at?

1488
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:17,980
Yeah, people don't like hearing beeps.

1489
01:45:17,980 --> 01:45:20,220
Shut up.

1490
01:45:20,220 --> 01:45:22,020
I'll see if I can find the sounds option.

1491
01:45:22,020 --> 01:45:25,740
Well, sort of simulated, I guess.

1492
01:45:25,740 --> 01:45:30,180
It's been noted on a few of the message boards that that

1493
01:45:30,180 --> 01:45:35,260
stupid bootleg DDR Megamix is actually running off a ported

1494
01:45:35,260 --> 01:45:38,860
version of StepMania to the system 573 boards, which, you

1495
01:45:38,860 --> 01:45:41,740
know, for those who don't know what that is, that's the

1496
01:45:41,740 --> 01:45:49,820
hardware that all DDR machines run off of. So it's technically StepMania running on that

1497
01:45:49,820 --> 01:46:00,020
and some special software and a hacked security chip. So why did the Freezeros look like shit?

1498
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:05,980
Because some of the files were corrupted on the disk, that's why. It was supposed to look

1499
01:46:05,980 --> 01:46:11,740
nicer than that but doesn't matter though because it's still just DDR

1500
01:46:11,740 --> 01:46:17,220
extreme they didn't add any new songs that's my favorite though is don't fall

1501
01:46:17,220 --> 01:46:28,060
off yeah don't fall off or the AT-ST will step on you anyways yeah that's

1502
01:46:28,060 --> 01:46:32,220
pretty much all that's going on nothing really big other than that I mean I'm

1503
01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:40,020
I'm sure, I think they're in the process of making DDR, or Dancing Stage Fever, converting

1504
01:46:40,020 --> 01:46:44,420
the songs over for StepMania, and they're still working on DDR Extreme, even though

1505
01:46:44,420 --> 01:46:48,700
I could have had them done weeks ago, but I just don't care anymore, so.

1506
01:46:48,700 --> 01:46:50,660
You don't get them from me, so there.

1507
01:46:50,660 --> 01:46:57,740
And that's pretty much it, nothing really, oh, well, we can talk about Into the Groove,

1508
01:46:57,740 --> 01:46:58,740
I guess that's simple.

1509
01:46:58,740 --> 01:46:59,740
Why not?

1510
01:46:59,740 --> 01:47:00,740
Go for it.

1511
01:47:00,740 --> 01:47:09,300
So, this is a new arcade dancing game that's being developed by the people that do StepMania,

1512
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:14,980
Chris Danford, Kiehl, who you might remember, we have a song of his in rotation, and also

1513
01:47:14,980 --> 01:47:21,180
Foyboy, I guess, or Fuby, I forget which one it was. I think it was Fuby, because he does

1514
01:47:21,180 --> 01:47:29,900
the steps on DWI Insanity, and so basically they're making their own home version, or

1515
01:47:29,900 --> 01:47:36,140
home version but eventually he's gonna go there but right now they're doing arcade mixes with

1516
01:47:36,140 --> 01:47:44,380
this Into the Groove thing which it sort it's like DDR it's more like um I don't know it's just

1517
01:47:44,380 --> 01:47:49,980
really weird looking that's all I gotta say it's really weird looking they're testing it right now

1518
01:47:49,980 --> 01:47:55,740
in a couple arcades there's one in Seattle I think it's a couple arcades now yeah there's one

1519
01:47:55,740 --> 01:48:00,740
They're doing one in Seattle and they're talking about doing one in Wisconsin. It's like one of the arcades.

1520
01:48:00,740 --> 01:48:01,740
Wisconsin.

1521
01:48:01,740 --> 01:48:04,740
Yeah, so they're doing those there.

1522
01:48:04,740 --> 01:48:05,740
They're doing those there.

1523
01:48:05,740 --> 01:48:06,740
They're actually doing those in Wisconsin.

1524
01:48:06,740 --> 01:48:14,740
But so far it's like, I don't know, I've listened to some of the music on there and it sucks. It sucks really bad.

1525
01:48:14,740 --> 01:48:17,740
I mean, Keel's good and all for, I guess, making music.

1526
01:48:17,740 --> 01:48:18,740
Yeah, I like a lot of his stuff.

1527
01:48:18,740 --> 01:48:21,740
I don't like any of the music that's in there so far.

1528
01:48:21,740 --> 01:48:24,740
You just think they picked the wrong ones to put in the game?

1529
01:48:24,740 --> 01:48:31,740
I don't know. They're just lame. They suck. It's just like playing that other game I was playing earlier.

1530
01:48:31,740 --> 01:48:33,740
Oh, we'll have to talk about that later, too.

1531
01:48:33,740 --> 01:48:48,740
But, um, God, no, it's not very good. They're like, this one guy posted this MP3 of the song Utopia that he loves, and I downloaded it and listened to it, and it's crap. I don't like it. I think it's retarded.

1532
01:48:48,740 --> 01:48:50,740
Well, now that's just your big, fat opinion.

1533
01:48:50,740 --> 01:48:53,740
Well, my big, fat opinion counts because, um...

1534
01:48:53,740 --> 01:48:54,620
You have a microphone.

1535
01:48:54,620 --> 01:48:56,100
I have, yeah, I have a microphone.

1536
01:48:56,100 --> 01:48:57,300
I have pretty good-tasting music.

1537
01:48:57,300 --> 01:49:02,500
There's a lot of music created by people, like custom music

1538
01:49:02,500 --> 01:49:05,900
that's made by people that doesn't sound like MIDI, OK?

1539
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:07,380
This is what the stuff sounds like.

1540
01:49:07,380 --> 01:49:09,340
It's just MIDI stuff.

1541
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:11,460
You can totally tell we're making this shit in Fruity

1542
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:14,060
Loops because everyone's like, oh, Fruity Loops is so

1543
01:49:14,060 --> 01:49:16,620
awesome, so awesome it is.

1544
01:49:16,620 --> 01:49:19,580
And then you go listen to these Japanese artists who do

1545
01:49:19,580 --> 01:49:21,020
the independent music also.

1546
01:49:21,020 --> 01:49:27,080
And, you know, it doesn't sound like, for loops, it sounds like a well-polished track.

1547
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:30,580
And this is the stuff that should be in there, but isn't.

1548
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:33,760
But they're going to, you know, license music, they say,

1549
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:37,040
which I don't think they're going to actually physically license music.

1550
01:49:37,100 --> 01:49:43,620
But anyways, the whole thing runs off of, off of Linux, because they don't want to, you know,

1551
01:49:43,620 --> 01:49:46,260
pay for Windows XP for every single machine.

1552
01:49:46,260 --> 01:49:47,580
So it's running off of Linux.

1553
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:50,980
It's pretty much a reworked StepMania.

1554
01:49:50,980 --> 01:49:56,100
It's more or less StepMania and they have different arrows and new mods and shit and

1555
01:49:56,100 --> 01:50:00,020
mines and all the crap that StepMania has.

1556
01:50:00,020 --> 01:50:02,340
It's just, I don't know.

1557
01:50:02,340 --> 01:50:03,340
I watch people play.

1558
01:50:03,340 --> 01:50:06,820
Oh, and there's songs with 11 and 12 footer steps.

1559
01:50:06,820 --> 01:50:09,700
I think that is so unnecessary.

1560
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:10,700
It's retarded.

1561
01:50:10,700 --> 01:50:14,620
I guess I shouldn't knock it until I've tried it, but I think the whole notion of songs

1562
01:50:14,620 --> 01:50:17,820
that were built to kill people is just unnecessary.

1563
01:50:17,820 --> 01:50:21,340
Honestly, Max Period was overdoing it.

1564
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:22,180
Was overdoing it.

1565
01:50:22,180 --> 01:50:25,260
That end where it gets 600 beats per minute and stuff,

1566
01:50:25,260 --> 01:50:27,140
that was just, it gets gay.

1567
01:50:27,140 --> 01:50:29,460
Not to mention that the song was ass.

1568
01:50:29,460 --> 01:50:32,100
It's just, it was really, really stupid what they're

1569
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:33,060
doing with it.

1570
01:50:33,060 --> 01:50:35,580
But you know, whatever.

1571
01:50:35,580 --> 01:50:38,860
If they say it's 50% done, it's not, you know, they can

1572
01:50:38,860 --> 01:50:41,620
always change that stuff later if people don't like it.

1573
01:50:41,620 --> 01:50:43,780
But the people they have testing it, if they're like,

1574
01:50:43,780 --> 01:50:46,820
ooh, I get the bar rape on this song, it's harder than

1575
01:50:46,820 --> 01:50:48,420
Legend of Max.

1576
01:50:48,420 --> 01:50:52,540
With all due respect to the folks up in Seattle, there are

1577
01:50:52,540 --> 01:50:56,740
the unreal players up there who can do this 11 and 12 stuff

1578
01:50:56,740 --> 01:50:58,580
no problem.

1579
01:50:58,580 --> 01:51:00,700
I worry that that's going to influence the

1580
01:51:00,700 --> 01:51:01,860
development of the mix.

1581
01:51:01,860 --> 01:51:05,940
And it's just like, OK, maybe one or two songs, yay, great.

1582
01:51:05,940 --> 01:51:07,980
But keep it to a minimum.

1583
01:51:07,980 --> 01:51:10,940
Me, personally, I enjoy those fun Seven Feet songs.

1584
01:51:10,940 --> 01:51:12,980
I liked some of the Max 2 USA steps.

1585
01:51:12,980 --> 01:51:14,540
I realize I'm in a minority.

1586
01:51:14,540 --> 01:51:18,900
But I kind of like the fun stuff more than I like the let's kill me steps, you know.

1587
01:51:18,900 --> 01:51:24,680
The whole point is, I mean, sure people like a challenge, but people like fun, intelligent steps too.

1588
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:27,880
There's a lot of songs that have intelligent steps, like Superstar.

1589
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:30,200
Superstar is a fun song to play, and it's not that hard.

1590
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:32,260
It's just fun.

1591
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:33,020
That's the whole point.

1592
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:34,820
And people play them over and over.

1593
01:51:34,820 --> 01:51:37,920
I mean, once you play like a really hard song, the only reason you play is

1594
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:40,640
to show off the friends and say, oh, look, I beat this song.

1595
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:41,980
I mean, that's pretty much it.

1596
01:51:41,980 --> 01:51:48,300
It's not like you play it for your own benefit, but I don't know.

1597
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:53,800
The whole idea about, you know, what the hell?

1598
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:55,820
Just let Jamie play with a webcam.

1599
01:51:55,820 --> 01:51:56,500
She's having fun.

1600
01:51:56,500 --> 01:51:57,060
Okay, okay.

1601
01:51:57,540 --> 01:52:04,700
Anyway, it's the whole point of like people, you know, making these bootlegs and stuff.

1602
01:52:04,700 --> 01:52:09,660
It's just, I don't know, it's very interesting to me and how Konami,

1603
01:52:09,660 --> 01:52:14,740
See, because technical economics can't really do much about it, because they're not,

1604
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:18,120
the machines aren't supposed to be over here in the first place, and they're kind of just,

1605
01:52:18,120 --> 01:52:21,880
you know, getting by licensing in various manners,

1606
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:24,440
by like pretending they don't exist type of thing.

1607
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:28,000
And so, kind of people have free reign on doing that.

1608
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:31,040
The only people that can come down on them are people in the United States,

1609
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:32,880
like the RIAA and stuff like that.

1610
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:35,560
Now, I think where they're going to run the trouble is

1611
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:37,920
because they're selling the machine, and that's the problem.

1612
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:53,920
Now, my thing on it which I was posing to our local arcade here is that you just do one custom homemade upgrade for one arcade.

1613
01:52:53,920 --> 01:52:58,920
I think the damage done by that would be minimal and the risk on it isn't that bad.

1614
01:52:58,920 --> 01:53:06,360
that bad. The repercussions would be like nothing. So, I posed that idea to our arcade

1615
01:53:06,360 --> 01:53:12,780
manager and they're actually interested. So, I don't know. We'll see. But I know later

1616
01:53:12,780 --> 01:53:18,280
this week I'm going down to the arcade and we're going to rip open the machine to see

1617
01:53:18,280 --> 01:53:23,760
what we can do as far as feasibly, you know, upgrading it that way. And all I got to say

1618
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:27,880
is if I do end up doing that, it's going to look nice and it'll be a lot better than all

1619
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:28,880
this other shit.

1620
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:33,720
And it's this, I've got word from, I heard this, this is

1621
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:35,720
pretty big news.

1622
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:37,200
Well, supposedly, I don't know.

1623
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:43,280
They posted this about the next generation DDR, but it's

1624
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:46,040
going to be coming out in like two or three years.

1625
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:48,160
Oh my god.

1626
01:53:48,160 --> 01:53:51,280
What about this Euromix that they're getting that's going to

1627
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:52,920
be on the new hardware, supposedly?

1628
01:53:52,920 --> 01:53:54,800
Well, that's Euromix.

1629
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:57,040
But still, they get stuff.

1630
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:58,520
Well, remember, if you remember correctly.

1631
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:00,360
It'll be a preview of what we can expect.

1632
01:54:00,360 --> 01:54:03,040
We're supposed to do new hardware with DDR Extreme,

1633
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:03,920
but they never did.

1634
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:04,420
True.

1635
01:54:04,420 --> 01:54:04,920
True.

1636
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:07,420
So.

1637
01:54:07,420 --> 01:54:07,920
Whatever.

1638
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:10,600
I mean, for all this talk that DDR is dead in Japan,

1639
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:13,280
I mean, then why was Extreme the number seven selling game?

1640
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:14,040
It's debut week.

1641
01:54:14,040 --> 01:54:14,880
You know, in the top 10.

1642
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:15,520
It's not dead.

1643
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:17,080
Look at 2DX.

1644
01:54:17,080 --> 01:54:19,600
Yep, they're freaking, you know, begged for a new game.

1645
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:21,100
That's a whole other story, though.

1646
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:24,360
That's just Konami being dicks.

1647
01:54:24,360 --> 01:54:25,920
All right, you guys want to know who

1648
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:32,920
won the cage match tonight? Tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge cage match is Holik.

1649
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:41,480
No, it's... It is a tie, ladies and gentlemen. The tie tonight...

1650
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:46,120
Stop tying people, God. I know, they always tie like every week.

1651
01:54:46,120 --> 01:54:50,160
We used to never have ties, and lately, in like past eight shows, we've had like six

1652
01:54:50,160 --> 01:54:56,780
ties. Anyway, the tie tonight is between two songs. It's between last week's winner, Little

1653
01:54:56,780 --> 01:55:09,780
Flower, and the second song that tied this week is Cool and the Gang with Get Down On

1654
01:55:09,780 --> 01:55:18,380
It, the 2001 mix. So, as you know, when we have a tie in the Orange Lounge Cage match,

1655
01:55:18,380 --> 01:55:26,220
The host, who did not win in the tie, would get to break that tie, and oh, that's me tonight.

1656
01:55:26,220 --> 01:55:30,780
My song only got one stinking vote, because your song sucks.

1657
01:55:30,780 --> 01:55:34,460
That being said, this is a no-brainer.

1658
01:55:34,460 --> 01:55:36,460
I vote for Jamie's.

1659
01:55:36,460 --> 01:55:37,460
Yay!

1660
01:55:37,460 --> 01:55:39,100
I know, let's pick another one.

1661
01:55:39,100 --> 01:55:47,740
Loki, you the man, but that song is the suck, so I pick Little Flowers, this week's cage

1662
01:55:47,740 --> 01:55:58,700
match winner for two weeks in a row so um enjoy i like the dog

1663
01:55:58,700 --> 01:56:03,220
i was gonna pick something really shitty but i could not find that damn track for the life

1664
01:56:03,220 --> 01:56:10,780
of me it was boys for love oh what boys for love and it was a song about being gay but

1665
01:56:10,780 --> 01:56:16,820
i couldn't find it and it was really funny it's just like it's a ddr song i have i can't

1666
01:56:16,820 --> 01:56:23,460
find it. I don't know where it went. Are you going to put it in your mix? I could, that

1667
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:37,740
would be funny. If I find it, maybe. All right. So, I think I'll take a break. When we come

1668
01:56:37,740 --> 01:56:43,660
back, we'll do the FUs of the week. So send those over private message to Sky. Hi, I'm

1669
01:56:43,660 --> 01:56:46,900
in the chat room and if you have something to bitch about, we're going to get it out

1670
01:56:46,900 --> 01:56:52,900
in the open on this next break. In the meantime, we've done a tack break, we've done a taka

1671
01:56:52,900 --> 01:56:58,900
break. I think now, like it or not, I think it's time to do Naoki break. What do you guys

1672
01:56:58,900 --> 01:56:59,900
think?

1673
01:56:59,900 --> 01:57:00,900
Cry.

1674
01:57:00,900 --> 01:57:05,260
Don't cry. No, we're going to play some good Naoki stuff. So we will be right back after

1675
01:57:05,260 --> 01:57:06,260
this break.

1676
01:59:06,260 --> 01:59:09,260
Why did you have to go away?

1677
01:59:09,260 --> 01:59:12,260
Always thought you'd stay

1678
01:59:12,260 --> 01:59:17,260
And keep on going over, over you

1679
01:59:17,260 --> 01:59:21,260
Tell me was it really true romance

1680
01:59:21,260 --> 01:59:24,260
Or just fantasy

1681
01:59:24,260 --> 01:59:27,260
I can't believe what we've been through

1682
01:59:27,260 --> 01:59:30,260
You're hanging out with someone new

1683
01:59:30,260 --> 01:59:33,260
Still you're in my heart, baby in my heart

1684
01:59:33,260 --> 01:59:35,260
Always in my heart

1685
01:59:35,260 --> 01:59:39,660
You'll never leave my heart till, till you've been my heart

1686
01:59:39,660 --> 01:59:45,260
Feet down in my heart, fill me with ecstasy

1687
01:59:45,260 --> 01:59:50,260
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1688
01:59:50,260 --> 01:59:53,260
Oh, baby, no, baby

1689
01:59:53,260 --> 01:59:56,260
Can't take you down to me

1690
01:59:56,260 --> 01:59:59,260
Was it just a fantasy?

1691
01:59:59,260 --> 02:00:02,260
What I've done for fear in reality

1692
02:00:02,260 --> 02:00:05,260
Oh baby, can't you just see

1693
02:00:05,260 --> 02:00:07,260
That I can't go on

1694
02:00:07,260 --> 02:00:10,260
Living without you

1695
02:00:10,260 --> 02:00:13,260
Still, still you're in my heart

1696
02:00:13,260 --> 02:00:14,260
Never leave my heart

1697
02:00:14,260 --> 02:00:17,260
Now it's forever more

1698
02:00:17,260 --> 02:00:19,260
Still, still you're in my heart

1699
02:00:19,260 --> 02:00:21,260
Always in my heart

1700
02:00:21,260 --> 02:00:27,260
When will I ever break free?

1701
02:02:21,260 --> 02:02:33,100
Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

1702
02:02:33,100 --> 02:02:37,260
is brought to you by the letter D, the letter A, and the number 59.

1703
02:02:37,260 --> 02:02:42,900
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

1704
02:02:42,900 --> 02:02:45,100
Hello everybody.

1705
02:02:45,100 --> 02:02:47,140
It's time to do the FUs of the Week.

1706
02:02:47,140 --> 02:02:50,260
Jamie, what are the FUs of the Week all about?

1707
02:02:50,260 --> 02:02:57,260
We get pissed off and tell everybody

1708
02:03:08,300 --> 02:03:12,540
My first F.U. of the week is a very important one

1709
02:03:12,540 --> 02:03:16,020
F.U. to Adultery

1710
02:03:16,020 --> 02:03:22,020
i'm not going to go into specifics about it because it involves a pretty good friend of mine

1711
02:03:22,020 --> 02:03:23,620
um...

1712
02:03:23,620 --> 02:03:25,900
but there's no

1713
02:03:25,900 --> 02:03:27,900
excuse for it

1714
02:03:27,900 --> 02:03:31,220
and i can't really

1715
02:03:31,220 --> 02:03:35,020
vouch for anyone who goes through with it who is

1716
02:03:35,020 --> 02:03:38,040
i'm not getting into details but just in general

1717
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:41,540
i can't i can't stand it

1718
02:03:41,540 --> 02:03:43,260
next thing

1719
02:03:43,260 --> 02:03:49,100
Um, F.U. to people who go ten miles under the speed limit in front of you.

1720
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:54,240
And then people who match your speed in the lane next to you so that you can't change lanes.

1721
02:03:56,120 --> 02:04:02,700
Um, you know what, I'm not really all that angsty, because I'm still looking forward to my vacation.

1722
02:04:03,500 --> 02:04:04,300
Mmm, casp.

1723
02:04:04,300 --> 02:04:15,980
FU to probably not having reliable internet access while I'm in Alabama, but I'll do what

1724
02:04:15,980 --> 02:04:16,980
I can.

1725
02:04:16,980 --> 02:04:26,140
And of course, FU for no remote way of me contributing to the show.

1726
02:04:26,140 --> 02:04:27,140
That's really about it.

1727
02:04:27,140 --> 02:04:29,020
I did, however, notice something.

1728
02:04:29,020 --> 02:04:36,420
Radio Shack logo looks remarkable like the battle royale logo. I think it's a government spot

1729
02:04:39,180 --> 02:04:42,540
With remote-control cars batteries and walkman

1730
02:04:44,300 --> 02:04:47,300
And cell phones a PCS for everybody, okay

1731
02:04:48,980 --> 02:04:50,980
E.t. Salio

1732
02:04:53,020 --> 02:04:55,360
All right, Loki you ready

1733
02:04:55,360 --> 02:05:11,560
I got the mic actually yes I am no fuck you with stupid bastards at Golfland not

1734
02:05:11,560 --> 02:05:15,160
necessarily people cuz you know people will be stupid and they'll flock no

1735
02:05:15,160 --> 02:05:20,840
matter yes I'm saying the bastards working behind the snack counter at

1736
02:05:20,840 --> 02:05:28,720
off land yesterday around 7pm. You suck because first off you have to go make a stupid comment

1737
02:05:28,720 --> 02:05:32,840
about my shirt. Yes I know what my shirt says and the fact that you comment about it does

1738
02:05:32,840 --> 02:05:38,660
not make you seem any more intelligent. I don't care if your friend is afraid of ninja

1739
02:05:38,660 --> 02:05:46,320
monkeys or ninja squirrels or any ninja rodent of whatever the case may be. I don't care

1740
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:53,760
and I also don't care that you're out of the large cup size I want a soda give me a fucking soda

1741
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:59,200
and just because you're stupid enough to drop the piece of pizza on the floor

1742
02:05:59,200 --> 02:06:05,520
and you give me the larger slice by calling this special piece of pizza I don't really care

1743
02:06:05,520 --> 02:06:11,440
and the fact that you tried to give me the piece of pizza attached to the giant uh cardboard circle

1744
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:13,840
it was on there to begin with

1745
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:15,960
I won it on a fucking plate

1746
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:20,480
and you tried to get me on this giant piece of cardboard, what the hell am I supposed to do with that?

1747
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:23,320
this guy was a complete idiot

1748
02:06:23,320 --> 02:06:27,800
not surprising, you were working at golf land

1749
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:29,920
um, other than that

1750
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:31,580
um

1751
02:06:31,580 --> 02:06:35,280
I don't like the cold, so fuck you mother nature

1752
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:36,580
for making it cold

1753
02:06:36,580 --> 02:06:39,660
all of a sudden, it was like ninety degrees one day

1754
02:06:39,660 --> 02:06:41,580
And then it dropped down to 50.

1755
02:06:41,580 --> 02:06:44,420
You can't just drop the temperature 40 degrees

1756
02:06:44,420 --> 02:06:46,380
and expect anyone to not care.

1757
02:06:49,540 --> 02:06:51,820
I have a comment to make.

1758
02:06:51,820 --> 02:06:52,420
OK.

1759
02:06:52,420 --> 02:06:55,260
I checked what the weather is in Alabama right now.

1760
02:06:55,260 --> 02:06:59,140
And at nighttime, below is 66 degrees.

1761
02:06:59,140 --> 02:06:59,700
That's cool.

1762
02:07:02,500 --> 02:07:04,380
And fuck you to my bank, because I

1763
02:07:04,380 --> 02:07:09,340
was overdrawn on my account for like $5, and they charged me 60.

1764
02:07:09,340 --> 02:07:10,500
So, they suck.

1765
02:07:13,040 --> 02:07:13,540
Sue them.

1766
02:07:14,440 --> 02:07:15,140
I can't sue them.

1767
02:07:15,140 --> 02:07:17,360
All you have to do is get a credit card with your bank.

1768
02:07:18,020 --> 02:07:21,220
So, if you overdraft a post from your card and you're not charged any fines,

1769
02:07:21,620 --> 02:07:22,820
you can just put it on your card.

1770
02:07:22,820 --> 02:07:23,620
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1771
02:07:23,900 --> 02:07:25,480
See, I used to do that too.

1772
02:07:25,480 --> 02:07:26,820
I used to have a credit card.

1773
02:07:27,040 --> 02:07:28,140
That's a big mistake.

1774
02:07:28,140 --> 02:07:31,100
Because not only do they charge you the $30 for overdrafting,

1775
02:07:31,540 --> 02:07:34,180
they charge you a fee on your credit card too.

1776
02:07:34,520 --> 02:07:36,060
It's just a big scam.

1777
02:07:36,440 --> 02:07:37,140
So, I think the problem.

1778
02:07:37,140 --> 02:07:38,420
What bank do you bank with?

1779
02:07:38,420 --> 02:07:42,420
No, no wonder. Hell's Cargo.

1780
02:07:42,420 --> 02:07:47,420
So anyways, yeah, they suck. But, um, whatever.

1781
02:07:47,420 --> 02:07:51,420
So, I'm done.

1782
02:07:51,420 --> 02:07:56,420
Alright.

1783
02:07:56,420 --> 02:08:00,420
My FU this week is a real no-brainer for me, actually.

1784
02:08:00,420 --> 02:08:05,420
Usually I have to sit here and think about what I'm going to say FU of the week to, uh, for a long time.

1785
02:08:05,420 --> 02:08:09,580
for a long time, but this week it's easy because I got really pissed off

1786
02:08:09,580 --> 02:08:15,100
at Final Fantasy XI earlier this week. So my nephew used to play online, the Sony people,

1787
02:08:15,100 --> 02:08:20,260
because when you put in your credit card information, you can't put in a space bar.

1788
02:08:20,260 --> 02:08:23,580
Your name is not allowed to have spaces.

1789
02:08:23,580 --> 02:08:29,900
If you don't, I'm sorry, if you have a space in your name, you don't exist to

1790
02:08:29,900 --> 02:08:31,300
the Final Fantasy people.

1791
02:08:31,300 --> 02:08:36,300
So I had to call tech support and all that stuff and they don't take

1792
02:08:36,560 --> 02:08:40,360
They won't register you over the phone at tech support for whatever reason

1793
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:42,680
I don't know why I'm sure if I bitch to wind enough

1794
02:08:42,680 --> 02:08:45,680
They probably would have but luckily the guy and I were able to make it work somehow

1795
02:08:45,680 --> 02:08:51,760
So I finally was able to get online the guy on the other end of the line at play online was actually very nice

1796
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:54,960
It was very good text customer service and tech support

1797
02:08:54,960 --> 02:08:57,960
So it it helped ease my anger a little bit

1798
02:08:57,960 --> 02:09:01,760
But whoever thought that one up to disable the space bar?

1799
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:03,720
Come on, why do you disable keys?

1800
02:09:03,720 --> 02:09:05,320
You never know when somebody might need to use it.

1801
02:09:05,320 --> 02:09:08,720
And for the record, I go by my middle name, actually.

1802
02:09:08,720 --> 02:09:10,320
So I use my first initial.

1803
02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:14,880
My bank has me in the system as my first initial space middle name.

1804
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:19,240
So I'm something space Robert in the system.

1805
02:09:19,240 --> 02:09:21,240
So that's why.

1806
02:09:21,240 --> 02:09:23,800
Yeah, I know you know, but we can keep it a secret.

1807
02:09:23,800 --> 02:09:24,680
I promise.

1808
02:09:24,680 --> 02:09:25,400
So.

1809
02:09:25,400 --> 02:09:27,360
And it's a nice name for me.

1810
02:09:27,360 --> 02:09:35,360
So screw you, who ever decided to come up with that disabling the space bar?

1811
02:09:35,360 --> 02:09:38,360
We're out in hell.

1812
02:09:38,360 --> 02:09:42,360
And it took me, also FU to file fantasy 11 because it took me about 5 hours to install.

1813
02:09:42,360 --> 02:09:45,360
But once I got in there, oh fuck it's beautiful.

1814
02:09:45,360 --> 02:09:49,360
I'm wondering if I installed the data I have.

1815
02:09:49,360 --> 02:09:50,360
If it would work.

1816
02:09:50,360 --> 02:09:54,360
Either way, you're going to have to sit there and download the 2 hour patch.

1817
02:09:54,360 --> 02:09:57,360
I doubt it will work, but it's worth a try.

1818
02:09:57,360 --> 02:09:58,360
It's worth it.

1819
02:09:58,360 --> 02:10:00,360
You don't have to pay for anything.

1820
02:10:00,360 --> 02:10:02,360
Cause I know there's people who already have.

1821
02:10:02,360 --> 02:10:05,360
I think the beta people had to upgrade, I think.

1822
02:10:05,360 --> 02:10:06,360
Stupid.

1823
02:10:06,360 --> 02:10:09,360
Thank god for Ragnarok.

1824
02:10:09,360 --> 02:10:10,360
Alright.

1825
02:10:10,360 --> 02:10:14,360
End of the chatroom, FUs.

1826
02:10:14,360 --> 02:10:16,360
Bag4U says,

1827
02:10:16,360 --> 02:10:22,360
Hey Sky, send an FU to Konami for being anal about the 2DX release.

1828
02:10:22,360 --> 02:10:24,360
agree that was kind of stupid of Konami

1829
02:10:25,240 --> 02:10:31,920
23rd magus says if you to slow leveling in Ragnarok online f you to my DDR skills slipping

1830
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:36,420
I can't pass Sakura anymore and a big f you to concert tickets being so overpriced

1831
02:10:36,440 --> 02:10:43,600
I'm sorry, but $30 a seat what you want to rate my wallet some more damn pay $30 is actually pretty cheap

1832
02:10:44,080 --> 02:10:47,480
I was pricing the tickets for Alan Jackson in there 45 apiece

1833
02:10:47,480 --> 02:10:51,360
you want to go see Elton John in Vegas prepare to pay a hundred dollars to the

1834
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:59,720
cheap seats crazy god it's just not so much some tickets cost John Fields would

1835
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:03,600
like to say F you to Microsoft your piece of shit software thinks my D drive

1836
02:11:03,600 --> 02:11:07,400
is corrupt now I have to rebuild my computer while trying to save as many

1837
02:11:07,400 --> 02:11:12,040

1838
02:11:12,040 --> 02:11:22,480
of twisting my ankle today oh and fuck you to Microsoft again you know what so

1839
02:11:22,480 --> 02:11:25,600
when I install Final Fantasy 11 something similar happened to me where it was

1840
02:11:25,600 --> 02:11:30,560
trying to boot for my disk drive I am Brad thank God Brad was here because he

1841
02:11:30,560 --> 02:11:33,960
was able to fix it I wouldn't know what to do I would have broken down and cried

1842
02:11:33,960 --> 02:11:41,320
at the $50 I would have wasted on nothing all right let's see Joe mama

1843
02:11:41,320 --> 02:11:47,000
I would like to say my FU of the week is to the shitty PC controls for Final Fantasy 11.

1844
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:51,920
I got used to the PC controls myself but I received a tip from Lanky Style who was a

1845
02:11:51,920 --> 02:11:53,440
beta tester for Final Fantasy 11.

1846
02:11:53,440 --> 02:11:56,480
He says use a kinky joy, it makes it a lot easier.

1847
02:11:56,480 --> 02:11:59,920
Get the Playstation controller hooked up to the computer and you'll enjoy Final Fantasy

1848
02:11:59,920 --> 02:12:01,320
11 a lot more.

1849
02:12:01,320 --> 02:12:03,560
I will try that in the future.

1850
02:12:03,560 --> 02:12:08,040
Snub Disrenoid says fuck the children that didn't come to my house and left me with about

1851
02:12:08,040 --> 02:12:13,040
five full pounds of Kit Kats, Twixes, and various other assorted candies.

1852
02:12:13,040 --> 02:12:14,040
You're complaining?

1853
02:12:14,040 --> 02:12:15,040
I'll take them.

1854
02:12:15,040 --> 02:12:18,040
Now I have to eat all of this crap or throw it out.

1855
02:12:18,040 --> 02:12:20,040
Thanks a lot you fucking overprotective parents.

1856
02:12:20,040 --> 02:12:22,040
You're saving your kids but killing my bowels.

1857
02:12:22,040 --> 02:12:24,040
Runs to bathroom to shit out chocolate.

1858
02:12:24,040 --> 02:12:26,040
So that's lovely.

1859
02:12:26,040 --> 02:12:29,040
Maybe I should have poisoned my candy to give those parents a real reason to keep their

1860
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:30,040
kids at home.

1861
02:12:30,040 --> 02:12:32,040
Then you'd still be stuck with it and you'd just have to throw it away.

1862
02:12:32,040 --> 02:12:33,040
God, it's wasted chocolate.

1863
02:12:33,040 --> 02:12:34,040
I know.

1864
02:12:34,040 --> 02:12:35,040
You know what?

1865
02:12:35,040 --> 02:12:36,040
Take it to school.

1866
02:12:36,040 --> 02:12:47,100
Wompo164 would like to say, fuck you to the Hot Topic raver wannabe 14 year olds who spend

1867
02:12:47,100 --> 02:12:51,840
their entire weekend from Friday until Sunday at the malls arcade and causing me to not

1868
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:59,240
single digit grade exotic ethnic going from 4 grades within 15 seconds left to 14.

1869
02:12:59,240 --> 02:13:04,240
T-underscore-T brought to you by me.

1870
02:13:04,240 --> 02:13:09,240
Minst went home from college for the weekend, that's the basis of my F.U.

1871
02:13:09,240 --> 02:13:16,240
F.U. to the local arcade, they now have a pump it up machine, it lags every time you hit an arrow and sometimes the song will just cut out.

1872
02:13:16,240 --> 02:13:19,240
They should have gotten the second DDR machine they said they were going to get.

1873
02:13:19,240 --> 02:13:22,240
Fuck you to it raining for 11 days straight over here.

1874
02:13:22,240 --> 02:13:28,240
Maybe they don't miss the difference between pump it up and DDR.

1875
02:13:28,240 --> 02:13:33,240
1. Zodiacknight would like to say I have no f**k you's because I love everyone equally.

1876
02:13:33,240 --> 02:13:38,240
Awww, hairball. Sorry.

1877
02:13:38,240 --> 02:13:46,240
2. Pixidust would like to say ok f**k this, I'm actually happy, I only have 3 f**k you's this week.

1878
02:13:46,240 --> 02:13:51,240
3. F**k Bacardi151 and being drunk to the point where I passed out when I got home.

1879
02:13:51,240 --> 02:13:58,140
Fuck dieting because I'm still the same damn weight and as always just because what if you wouldn't be complete without pixie dust saying

1880
02:13:58,200 --> 02:14:03,760
Fuck having big boobs. I can't do step aerobics properly with these things flapping like two puppies

1881
02:14:04,280 --> 02:14:06,280
Okay, I'm done and love you Rob. What?

1882
02:14:06,840 --> 02:14:13,520
Love you, too. You know what and notice how no love for Jamie or Loki. It's all me. Oh, sure. I'm the best

1883
02:14:13,520 --> 02:14:20,520
No, you know what? They make an exercise bra that's really good for big boob women.

1884
02:14:20,520 --> 02:14:23,520
I used it for a little while.

1885
02:14:23,520 --> 02:14:26,520
Boobs?

1886
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:31,520
Yes, Loki? What are you doing, Loki?

1887
02:14:31,520 --> 02:14:35,520
I'm going to go to the next FU.

1888
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:37,520
There's something for someone to comment on.

1889
02:14:37,520 --> 02:14:38,520
What?

1890
02:14:38,520 --> 02:14:40,520
Oh, what do you want to comment on?

1891
02:14:40,520 --> 02:14:42,520
BananaBoobs.com

1892
02:14:42,520 --> 02:14:53,040
about the dieting thing, don't diet, do a lifestyle adjustment.

1893
02:14:54,200 --> 02:14:54,980
That's, that's good.

1894
02:14:56,520 --> 02:14:59,460
Oh, and she says, she says in the public chat room, love you, Jamie.

1895
02:15:00,640 --> 02:15:02,080
Yay, we love you too.

1896
02:15:04,240 --> 02:15:05,360
What's the link you're going to post?

1897
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:09,760
Some boob thing, some straight man thing.

1898
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:17,320
this game rocks and this is for you pixie disc frontal assault the ultimate boob game

1899
02:15:17,320 --> 02:15:25,120

1902
02:15:34,840 --> 02:15:42,000
a Spanish teacher that I have. You know my Spanish 2 teacher, my least favorite teacher

1903
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:45,880
of all, no my second least favorite teacher of all time. You know what Rob? What? I never

1904
02:15:45,880 --> 02:15:57,280
took Spanish. I took French and Japanese at the same time. Como te llama? Fuego! El telefono

1905
02:15:57,280 --> 02:15:58,280
Luce libre!

1906
02:15:58,280 --> 02:16:07,280
Just like all the words in Spanish right there, Luce libre and last F U.

1907
02:16:07,280 --> 02:16:08,280
Telemundo.

1908
02:16:08,280 --> 02:16:12,560
Wampa164 would like to say, fuck Halloween for being a shitty holiday that's more of

1909
02:16:12,560 --> 02:16:16,320
an excuse for people to vandalize people's houses and property by teenagers.

1910
02:16:16,320 --> 02:16:18,280
Well, that's the best recipe.

1911
02:16:18,280 --> 02:16:19,280
The end.

1912
02:16:19,280 --> 02:16:20,280
Are they ever?

1913
02:16:20,280 --> 02:16:21,280
What the fuck is this?

1914
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:28,880
I love Loki too, but don't tell Nellie.

1915
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:37,200
As Loki brings up the world domination of the boob game that Jamie is watching, it's

1916
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:46,240
this giant pair of tits that you kind of use your hand to kind of throw.

1917
02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:50,360
It's kind of like DDR in a way because these little things scroll down the screen and you

1918
02:16:50,360 --> 02:16:52,260
have to do the steps.

1919
02:16:52,260 --> 02:16:53,660
You have to do tricks with the boobs.

1920
02:16:53,660 --> 02:16:56,300
Like you either have to swing them one way, or you do like a

1921
02:16:56,300 --> 02:16:58,920
spiral, or you have to just bounce them up and down.

1922
02:16:58,920 --> 02:17:00,180
It's all very interesting.

1923
02:17:03,220 --> 02:17:04,460
I swear.

1924
02:17:06,220 --> 02:17:07,180
OK.

1925
02:17:07,180 --> 02:17:09,700
As Jamie is fascinated by the boob game.

1926
02:17:09,700 --> 02:17:10,940
This game is stupid.

1927
02:17:14,620 --> 02:17:16,620
I think what we'll do is we'll take another break.

1928
02:17:16,620 --> 02:17:17,180
Eh?

1929
02:17:17,180 --> 02:17:17,860
Eh?

1930
02:17:17,860 --> 02:17:18,720
OK.

1931
02:17:18,720 --> 02:17:22,160
And this break is going to be an LED break.

1932
02:17:22,160 --> 02:17:23,240
Somebody suggested to me.

1933
02:17:23,240 --> 02:17:25,520
I forgot who, but I'm sure they'll be happy to hear that.

1934
02:17:25,520 --> 02:17:29,020
We're going to do an LED break, because LED is awesome.

1935
02:17:29,020 --> 02:17:31,760
And we need to hear some more LED songs, so we're going to

1936
02:17:31,760 --> 02:17:34,320
play some right now for you guys.

1937
02:17:34,320 --> 02:17:36,520
So enjoy this break, and we'll be back.

1938
02:17:36,520 --> 02:17:39,480
And we're going to do a list list when we come back, yes?

1939
02:17:39,480 --> 02:17:40,040
Yes.

1940
02:17:40,040 --> 02:17:40,600
All right.

1941
02:17:40,600 --> 02:17:47,600
we'll do that

1942
02:18:40,600 --> 02:19:08,600
Don't you ever let me go Don't you ever let me go

1943
02:19:08,600 --> 02:19:12,600
The

1944
02:19:12,600 --> 02:19:16,600
The

1945
02:19:16,600 --> 02:19:20,600
The

1946
02:19:20,600 --> 02:19:24,600
The

1947
02:19:24,600 --> 02:19:28,600
The

1948
02:19:28,600 --> 02:19:32,600
The

1949
02:19:32,600 --> 02:19:36,600
The

1950
02:19:36,600 --> 02:19:38,600
You

1951
02:20:06,600 --> 02:20:09,520
I'm sick of all your pieces, mama

1952
02:20:09,520 --> 02:20:12,180
Well, I like your good, good, good, good

1953
02:20:12,180 --> 02:20:14,220
But I'm just in the sky

1954
02:20:14,220 --> 02:20:17,660
Oh, yeah, no, no, no, no

1955
02:20:17,660 --> 02:20:20,280
I'm just gonna go and find my way

1956
02:20:20,280 --> 02:20:26,740
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah

1957
02:20:26,740 --> 02:20:31,620
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah

1958
02:24:01,620 --> 02:24:06,620
.

1959
02:24:06,620 --> 02:24:11,620
.

1960
02:24:11,620 --> 02:24:16,640
.

1961
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:21,640
.

1962
02:24:21,640 --> 02:24:26,640
.

1963
02:24:56,640 --> 02:25:24,640
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge radio staff meeting.

1964
02:25:24,640 --> 02:25:30,760
Xtreme Bimani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

1965
02:25:30,760 --> 02:25:34,920
You know what's funny is that promo predates DDRXtreme.

1966
02:25:34,920 --> 02:25:42,280
That promo was when, that was made right before the second show, because I was gone for the

1967
02:25:42,280 --> 02:25:43,920
second and third shows.

1968
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:46,160
I was in Alabama.

1969
02:25:46,160 --> 02:25:50,440
I swear to God when you get back from Alabama before season 4 premieres we're going to sit

1970
02:25:50,440 --> 02:25:53,880
down and do new promos for season 4 and that's going to be our treat to everybody.

1971
02:25:53,880 --> 02:25:57,680
Well, I'm back the whole Wednesday with nothing going on.

1972
02:25:57,680 --> 02:25:58,680
Well, yeah.

1973
02:25:58,680 --> 02:25:59,680
We'll see what we can do.

1974
02:25:59,680 --> 02:26:00,680
Get together.

1975
02:26:00,680 --> 02:26:01,680
All right.

1976
02:26:01,680 --> 02:26:04,480
As promised, tonight we're going to do a list list, and earlier in the show we said we wanted

1977
02:26:04,480 --> 02:26:08,800
to do a game they should most make a movie out of, but we put our brains together and

1978
02:26:08,800 --> 02:26:13,680
we could swear that somewhere in the history of Warren Tontroy we have done the topic before.

1979
02:26:13,680 --> 02:26:20,560
I'm almost positive Castlevania came out on top when we did that list, because I remember

1980
02:26:20,560 --> 02:26:25,880
Somebody said Guardian Legend, because Guardian Legend comes up on every list, and something

1981
02:26:25,880 --> 02:26:26,880
like that.

1982
02:26:26,880 --> 02:26:31,160
So I'm almost positive that was done before, so we decided to shelve it, and instead we

1983
02:26:31,160 --> 02:26:36,960
thought we'd go the other way around and say movie they most need to make a game out of.

1984
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:39,960
So we haven't done listless in a long, long time, so I'm going to explain how this works.

1985
02:26:39,960 --> 02:26:41,640
This is excluding ones that have already been done, by the way.

1986
02:26:41,640 --> 02:26:43,640
Yes, excluding ones that have already been done.

1987
02:26:43,640 --> 02:26:46,160
Or similar, because that lights a calf of mine.

1988
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:49,800
Yeah, because, well, I kind of put one that they did have a game a long time ago, but

1989
02:26:49,800 --> 02:26:50,500
need a new one.

1990
02:26:51,620 --> 02:26:52,920
So, cheater.

1991
02:26:52,920 --> 02:26:54,000
Anyway, yeah I cheated.

1992
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,720
Deal with it.

1993
02:26:56,720 --> 02:26:59,320
Basically, the way this works is that we're going to go

1994
02:26:59,320 --> 02:26:59,880
around the room.

1995
02:26:59,880 --> 02:27:01,400
And we're going to name our top fours.

1996
02:27:01,400 --> 02:27:03,760
There's only three of us, and I usually only do top three.

1997
02:27:03,760 --> 02:27:05,240
But since there's only three of us here tonight, we're going

1998
02:27:05,240 --> 02:27:07,140
to do our top four list.

1999
02:27:07,140 --> 02:27:09,200
And then we're going to have our big list, the definitive

2000
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:11,880
list, and then we'll go around.

2001
02:27:11,880 --> 02:27:14,320
And the fun part is, we each take one off.

2002
02:27:14,320 --> 02:27:16,480
One that we feel is not deserving to be there.

2003
02:27:16,480 --> 02:27:17,900
It really shouldn't be there, so we're going to take one

2004
02:27:17,900 --> 02:27:18,560
off.

2005
02:27:18,560 --> 02:27:20,840
Then the chat room gets the ultimate say.

2006
02:27:20,840 --> 02:27:24,880
The chat room gets to vote on the definitive top three list.

2007
02:27:24,880 --> 02:27:29,880
Tonight's topic, movie they most need to make a game out of.

2008
02:27:29,880 --> 02:27:32,600
So here we go.

2009
02:27:32,600 --> 02:27:35,120
First up, we have, what do you want to start, Jamie?

2010
02:27:35,120 --> 02:27:35,600
Sure.

2011
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:37,640
All right, Jamie, your number four pick for tonight.

2012
02:27:37,640 --> 02:27:41,680
The number four should be The Never Ending Story.

2013
02:27:41,680 --> 02:27:43,280
Make it an RPG.

2014
02:27:43,280 --> 02:27:45,440
Any reason why a never ending story?

2015
02:27:45,440 --> 02:27:48,840
just

2016
02:27:48,840 --> 02:27:50,560
because it would have a kick-ass theme song

2017
02:27:50,560 --> 02:27:55,960
yes, fight. Dear God I hope... I want the whole... I want a whole...

2018
02:27:55,960 --> 02:27:57,000
Ring then!

2019
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:58,880
Okay then take that off the list

2020
02:27:58,880 --> 02:28:01,560
on PC, PC games don't count. Okay, take it off.

2021
02:28:01,560 --> 02:28:03,840
Do a labyrinth.

2022
02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:07,560
I know they had a labyrinth game on Converse 64, but that could be one of those really old

2023
02:28:07,560 --> 02:28:09,480
games that needs to be updated.

2024
02:28:09,480 --> 02:28:12,480
Okay. Alright, labyrinth.

2025
02:28:12,480 --> 02:28:14,980
Because then that means Rendered David Bullies.

2026
02:28:14,980 --> 02:28:15,480
Exactly.

2027
02:28:15,480 --> 02:28:15,980
Alright.

2028
02:28:16,480 --> 02:28:16,980
Okay.

2029
02:28:18,480 --> 02:28:19,480
Nobody played it.

2030
02:28:19,480 --> 02:28:21,480
It was on Commodore 64, nobody played it.

2031
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:22,480
Yeah.

2032
02:28:22,480 --> 02:28:23,480
Um, anyways.

2033
02:28:23,480 --> 02:28:23,980
Loki.

2034
02:28:24,480 --> 02:28:24,980
Um.

2035
02:28:25,480 --> 02:28:28,480
My pick is going to be, um.

2036
02:28:28,980 --> 02:28:30,480
God, there's so many.

2037
02:28:32,980 --> 02:28:34,980
I'm gonna have to go with Showgirls.

2038
02:28:35,480 --> 02:28:36,480
Because, um.

2039
02:28:37,480 --> 02:28:37,980
You.

2040
02:28:38,480 --> 02:28:39,480
I can see it now.

2041
02:28:39,480 --> 02:28:41,480
You're struggling to get to the top of the world.

2042
02:28:41,480 --> 02:28:46,240
You know do whatever it takes. It's a story about survival. I

2043
02:28:47,160 --> 02:28:49,160
like that I did that sounds like you could be a

2044
02:28:49,480 --> 02:28:55,720
It would just be a really emotional kind of game with a really great back story. You don't know shit. You don't know shit

2045
02:28:56,680 --> 02:29:01,320
One of my very favorite movies of all time a pick close to my heart Loki. Thank you

2046
02:29:02,240 --> 02:29:03,080
All right

2047
02:29:03,080 --> 02:29:09,960
My number four pick is a game that it actually did have a game back in the 80s and they even

2048
02:29:09,960 --> 02:29:13,960
updated it somewhat recently, but all it was was a newer version of the 80s game, and it

2049
02:29:13,960 --> 02:29:18,960
sucks. I want them to just scrap it all and do a new one. The Rocky Horror Picture Show.

2050
02:29:18,960 --> 02:29:23,960
They did a game? They did a game, and it sucks ass, so they need a new one. What was this

2051
02:29:23,960 --> 02:29:29,960
on? It was on Apple IIe, and then they did an updated version of it not too long ago,

2052
02:29:29,960 --> 02:29:33,960
but it was just an updated version of it. It sucked. They need to totally just scrap

2053
02:29:33,960 --> 02:29:38,960
the concept and do a new one. I'm going to give them a do-over. And technically it's

2054
02:29:38,960 --> 02:29:40,840
It's a game based on the play.

2055
02:29:40,840 --> 02:29:42,920
It's a Rocky Horror Show game.

2056
02:29:42,920 --> 02:29:45,880
So they haven't done the game for the Rocky Horror Picture

2057
02:29:45,880 --> 02:29:46,520
Show.

2058
02:29:46,520 --> 02:29:48,120
So that's my loophole.

2059
02:29:48,120 --> 02:29:50,040
So it'll be just a couple of songs there.

2060
02:29:54,320 --> 02:29:56,520
My number four pick is the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

2061
02:29:56,520 --> 02:29:57,200
All right.

2062
02:29:57,200 --> 02:29:58,520
My number three.

2063
02:29:58,520 --> 02:29:59,520
Number three, Jamie.

2064
02:29:59,520 --> 02:30:03,680
Is Monty Python and the Holy Grail RPG.

2065
02:30:03,680 --> 02:30:08,880
Just think of the potential, especially with the

2066
02:30:08,880 --> 02:30:13,080
I did a Terry Gilliam doing all the artwork for it.

2067
02:30:13,080 --> 02:30:14,480
It'd be awesome.

2068
02:30:14,480 --> 02:30:15,000
It'd be awesome.

2069
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:15,560
I'd love it.

2070
02:30:15,560 --> 02:30:18,140
And, of course, they need to insert the one-on-one

2071
02:30:18,140 --> 02:30:19,100
with the Black Knight.

2072
02:30:19,100 --> 02:30:21,720
The Ministry of Coconuts, you know, little snippet of it.

2073
02:30:21,720 --> 02:30:22,840
It could be a rhythm game.

2074
02:30:22,840 --> 02:30:25,400
Proper use of the coconut.

2075
02:30:25,400 --> 02:30:27,320
That could be a special controller.

2076
02:30:27,320 --> 02:30:29,520
You'd play as, what was his squire's name?

2077
02:30:29,520 --> 02:30:30,320
Patsy.

2078
02:30:30,320 --> 02:30:30,820
Yep.

2079
02:30:30,820 --> 02:30:32,320
And then you can eat the minstrels.

2080
02:30:32,320 --> 02:30:33,680
Message for yourself.

2081
02:30:33,680 --> 02:30:35,800
You can eat the minstrels.

2082
02:30:35,800 --> 02:30:37,120
And that was much rejoicing.

2083
02:30:37,120 --> 02:30:38,480
Yay.

2084
02:30:38,480 --> 02:30:43,160
Loki, your number three pick, a newer one that just came to my head right now.

2085
02:30:44,680 --> 02:30:46,440
Orgazmo, the video game.

2086
02:30:47,680 --> 02:30:49,280
What would be a first person shooter?

2087
02:30:49,480 --> 02:30:52,900
Now you're a man, man, man, man.

2088
02:30:53,540 --> 02:30:55,740
Oh my, I will let you borrow my tape.

2089
02:30:55,740 --> 02:30:56,700
I have a tape somewhere.

2090
02:30:56,900 --> 02:30:57,620
I have a tape.

2091
02:30:58,200 --> 02:31:00,160
Let the woman borrow it so she can see it.

2092
02:31:00,240 --> 02:31:02,340
Okay. Go ahead.

2093
02:31:03,560 --> 02:31:04,300
Oh, it's great.

2094
02:31:04,300 --> 02:31:06,260
All right, Orgazmo the game, good idea.

2095
02:31:06,260 --> 02:31:11,240
All right, my number three pick is probably a small movie you may not have heard of,

2096
02:31:11,240 --> 02:31:14,320
but those that have seen it know why this needs to be a video game.

2097
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:16,700
Pink Flamingos, the game.

2098
02:31:19,560 --> 02:31:22,840
Pink Flamingos is a John Waters early movie.

2099
02:31:22,840 --> 02:31:26,460
It's one of the most disgusting films ever made, and it's about two people,

2100
02:31:26,740 --> 02:31:30,040
or I should say three people, because there's a couple, and Divine, of course,

2101
02:31:30,040 --> 02:31:32,580
in one of her best roles ever, they're in a competition

2102
02:31:32,580 --> 02:31:34,580
to be the filthiest person in the world.

2103
02:31:34,580 --> 02:31:39,360
And imagine if you could participate in that competition to be the filthiest person in the world.

2104
02:31:39,560 --> 02:31:41,860
And at the end, like the last stage, you can eat dog shit.

2105
02:31:42,860 --> 02:31:45,160
I just had an odd thought.

2106
02:31:45,360 --> 02:31:45,640
What?

2107
02:31:47,240 --> 02:31:50,220
They've made the creative machine that merges two people into one.

2108
02:31:50,940 --> 02:31:53,080
And so they take John Waters and John Hughes.

2109
02:31:55,280 --> 02:31:55,780
Imagine.

2110
02:31:55,780 --> 02:31:57,060
They just get hairspray.

2111
02:31:57,460 --> 02:31:57,860
Oh, yeah.

2112
02:31:57,980 --> 02:31:59,260
All right.

2113
02:31:59,260 --> 02:32:01,380
Anyway, your number three pick, Jamie.

2114
02:32:01,380 --> 02:32:01,840
My number three pick.

2115
02:32:01,840 --> 02:32:02,660
I'm sorry, your number two pick.

2116
02:32:02,660 --> 02:32:05,660
My number two pick is Kill Bill.

2117
02:32:05,660 --> 02:32:09,660
Having to go through your enemies, and then all the fight scenes play like Bushido Blade.

2118
02:32:09,660 --> 02:32:11,660
God damn you, that was my number one.

2119
02:32:11,660 --> 02:32:12,660
Bitch.

2120
02:32:12,660 --> 02:32:14,660
You better not take my number one or I'll kick your ass.

2121
02:32:14,660 --> 02:32:15,660
Alright.

2122
02:32:15,660 --> 02:32:17,660
You know what my number one is.

2123
02:32:17,660 --> 02:32:18,660
I can guess.

2124
02:32:18,660 --> 02:32:20,660
Loki.

2125
02:32:20,660 --> 02:32:24,660
Oh, this one should be easy.

2126
02:32:24,660 --> 02:32:31,660
The Oral Adventures of Kravenmoorhead.

2127
02:32:31,660 --> 02:32:37,660
I can see this one playing out like Commander Keen or something like that.

2128
02:32:39,660 --> 02:32:41,660
It's a porno movie, folks!

2129
02:32:42,660 --> 02:32:49,660
But hey, it's got 17 videos already. With a franchise that large, it needs a game.

2130
02:32:51,660 --> 02:32:52,660
I mean...

2131
02:32:52,660 --> 02:32:54,660
Alright, fair enough.

2132
02:32:54,660 --> 02:32:56,660
My number two pick...

2133
02:32:56,660 --> 02:32:57,660
Right...

2134
02:32:57,660 --> 02:33:01,660
My number two pick is a movie you probably have never seen, but I'll explain it for you.

2135
02:33:01,660 --> 02:33:04,660
It's Trick, the game.

2136
02:33:06,660 --> 02:33:11,660
Trick is a nice little piece of gay cinema that's about two guys that just run into each other on the subway

2137
02:33:11,660 --> 02:33:14,660
that are trying desperately to find a place to fuck.

2138
02:33:14,660 --> 02:33:17,660
And I'm thinking this will make an exciting video game.

2139
02:33:17,660 --> 02:33:19,660
It could be like one of those stealth games.

2140
02:33:19,660 --> 02:33:21,660
Have you ever played Thief? That could be it.

2141
02:33:21,660 --> 02:33:24,660
It could be like, we've got to find a place to screw right now.

2142
02:33:24,660 --> 02:33:26,660
And there's a time limit and everything.

2143
02:33:26,660 --> 02:33:30,420
trick the game and who could even have a cameo from Tori Spelling just like the

2144
02:33:30,420 --> 02:33:35,900
movie did be beautiful so I trick the game is my number two pick my number one

2145
02:33:35,900 --> 02:33:40,460
yes you're number one now I was thinking of scanners but then again there was

2146
02:33:40,460 --> 02:33:44,460
Galerians where you have people thinking of people hard enough that makes her

2147
02:33:44,460 --> 02:33:50,420
heads explode they already did that and all kinds of others I figured in keeping

2148
02:33:50,420 --> 02:33:55,980
with because it's me right would have battle royale of course game and it

2149
02:33:55,980 --> 02:34:00,380
would work and make it like you have survival horror mode or you have

2150
02:34:00,380 --> 02:34:05,880
multiplayer mode and your friends if you've got xbox put it on xbox network

2151
02:34:05,880 --> 02:34:12,180
those bad boys you could have the whole classroom who would win think about it

2152
02:34:12,180 --> 02:34:18,520
excellent catch all right like your number one pick for gay or movie that

2153
02:34:18,520 --> 02:34:23,460
most needs to be a game no one except for maybe the people in the studio have

2154
02:34:23,460 --> 02:34:29,780
actually seen this movie since it's that awful but it needs a game and I will put

2155
02:34:29,780 --> 02:34:35,340
the picture up on the cam it is cheerleader ninja yeah cheerleader

2156
02:34:35,340 --> 02:34:40,220
ninjas I would love to see a game for this

2157
02:34:42,900 --> 02:34:48,480
awesome any other can you briefly explain what this movie is about for

2158
02:34:48,480 --> 02:34:51,820
those that may not have seen it it's about these cheerleaders who are being

2159
02:34:51,820 --> 02:34:58,100
blamed for smut on the internet and they have to fight these nuns and there's

2160
02:34:58,100 --> 02:35:03,580
this gay guy who's like the head no person of their group or whatever of the

2161
02:35:03,580 --> 02:35:07,900
nun group and he's just pissed off because because he never got he never

2162
02:35:07,900 --> 02:35:13,340
got into the cheerleading squad and it's just it's so horrible and the movie has

2163
02:35:13,340 --> 02:35:19,180
all the stunt doubles are blow-up dolls and it's just great it's a great great

2164
02:35:19,180 --> 02:35:22,220
Great, great B movie.

2165
02:35:22,220 --> 02:35:24,940
I'm not sure if this movie had a...

2166
02:35:24,940 --> 02:35:29,060
Jamie took my number one, so I'm having a stretch here, but I'm thinking the more I

2167
02:35:29,060 --> 02:35:30,060
think about it, this would be an awesome game.

2168
02:35:30,060 --> 02:35:31,060
It may have already had one.

2169
02:35:31,060 --> 02:35:32,060
I don't know though.

2170
02:35:32,060 --> 02:35:34,060
Did Starship Troopers have a game?

2171
02:35:34,060 --> 02:35:35,060
Yes.

2172
02:35:35,060 --> 02:35:36,060
Damn it.

2173
02:35:36,060 --> 02:35:38,060
It was a 3D first person shooter game.

2174
02:35:38,060 --> 02:35:39,700
Damn it, damn it, damn it.

2175
02:35:39,700 --> 02:35:40,700
I got one.

2176
02:35:40,700 --> 02:35:43,100
You can do contact the game.

2177
02:35:43,100 --> 02:35:44,100
No.

2178
02:35:44,100 --> 02:35:48,420
You play through the whole game and you find out the end boss is just her dad, and I don't

2179
02:35:48,420 --> 02:35:52,420
Fuck that. No contact the game. I don't want that to happen.

2180
02:35:52,420 --> 02:35:54,420
Geely the game. You struggle to keep your...

2181
02:35:54,420 --> 02:35:57,420
No. No Geely the game either. I need more ideas.

2182
02:35:57,420 --> 02:35:59,420
I think, I think, um...

2183
02:35:59,420 --> 02:36:03,420
I'm liking the idea of Jay and Silent Bob strike back the game.

2184
02:36:03,420 --> 02:36:05,420
I was gonna say that.

2185
02:36:05,420 --> 02:36:07,420
Or better yet, Clerks. Let's do Clerks.

2186
02:36:07,420 --> 02:36:08,420
Clerks the game.

2187
02:36:08,420 --> 02:36:09,420
That was on my list.

2188
02:36:09,420 --> 02:36:10,420
That was on my list.

2189
02:36:10,420 --> 02:36:12,420
We're gonna do Clerks the game.

2190
02:36:12,420 --> 02:36:14,420
I'm not even supposed to be in this game.

2191
02:36:14,420 --> 02:36:16,420
I'm not even supposed to play this today.

2192
02:36:16,420 --> 02:36:19,420
That could be the tagline, it could be beautiful.

2193
02:36:19,420 --> 02:36:22,420
Or it could be like a sports game, Clerks Rooftop Hockey.

2194
02:36:22,420 --> 02:36:23,420
Yes!

2195
02:36:23,420 --> 02:36:25,420
It's a collection of mini games.

2196
02:36:25,420 --> 02:36:28,420
But you can get the alternate ending.

2197
02:36:28,420 --> 02:36:30,420
Oh.

2198
02:36:30,420 --> 02:36:33,420
Where everyone dies.

2199
02:36:33,420 --> 02:36:34,420
Wasn't that what happened?

2200
02:36:34,420 --> 02:36:35,420
Well, he got shot.

2201
02:36:35,420 --> 02:36:36,420
Oh, he just got shot.

2202
02:36:36,420 --> 02:36:37,420
The original ending.

2203
02:36:37,420 --> 02:36:38,420
Alright.

2204
02:36:38,420 --> 02:36:39,420
So here we are.

2205
02:36:39,420 --> 02:36:40,420
This is the list we have so far.

2206
02:36:40,420 --> 02:36:42,420
Next up is the elimination round.

2207
02:36:42,420 --> 02:37:01,420
We have Labyrinth, Showgirls, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Orgazmo, Pink Flamingos, Kill Bill, The Oral Adventures of Kraven Moorhead, Trick, Battle Royale, Cheerleader Ninjas, and Clerks.

2208
02:37:01,420 --> 02:37:09,420
Jamie, what has to come off this list?

2209
02:37:09,420 --> 02:37:14,900
I'm sorry, but I don't see how that could be made into a game.

2210
02:37:14,900 --> 02:37:15,900
Jamie!

2211
02:37:15,900 --> 02:37:16,900
You're killing me!

2212
02:37:16,900 --> 02:37:20,260
Unless it played like the Spice Girls game, which sucks.

2213
02:37:20,260 --> 02:37:22,260
You're killing me, Jamie.

2214
02:37:22,260 --> 02:37:23,380
It could be a dance game.

2215
02:37:23,380 --> 02:37:27,180
They would never be able to do it justice.

2216
02:37:27,180 --> 02:37:28,180
You're right, you're right.

2217
02:37:28,180 --> 02:37:29,980
They could never do it justice.

2218
02:37:29,980 --> 02:37:30,980
You're right.

2219
02:37:30,980 --> 02:37:31,980
Thank you.

2220
02:37:31,980 --> 02:37:32,980
I'm okay with that pick now, Jamie.

2221
02:37:32,980 --> 02:37:33,980
Okay.

2222
02:37:33,980 --> 02:37:35,980
Loki, your turn to take something off the list.

2223
02:37:35,980 --> 02:37:39,980
Here comes Loki, here comes Loki.

2224
02:37:39,980 --> 02:37:42,980
A glass of something, is that blood?

2225
02:37:42,980 --> 02:37:47,980
Yes, the blood of all fruit.

2226
02:37:47,980 --> 02:37:50,980
It's tropical punch blood.

2227
02:37:50,980 --> 02:37:52,980
Okay, anyways.

2228
02:37:52,980 --> 02:37:55,980
Loki, what's coming off the list?

2229
02:37:55,980 --> 02:37:56,980
Painful Mingos.

2230
02:37:56,980 --> 02:37:57,980
You bitch.

2231
02:37:57,980 --> 02:37:58,980
That's gone.

2232
02:37:58,980 --> 02:38:06,980
I like the idea of Trick as a survival horror game, but I thought it was like a stealth game, but as painful amigos, I can't do that.

2233
02:38:06,980 --> 02:38:08,980
Alright, you bastard.

2234
02:38:08,980 --> 02:38:18,980
You know what? I'm sorry, but The Oral Adventures of Craven Moorhead, it's way too obscure. I'm letting cheerleader ninjas slip by, for God's sake.

2235
02:38:18,980 --> 02:38:20,980
The cheerleader ninjas would own it.

2236
02:38:20,980 --> 02:38:26,980
The Oral Adventures of Craven Moorhead is just a little too out there. It's a little too out there, so I'm going to have to take that off.

2237
02:38:26,980 --> 02:38:31,600
that off okay so here's what's left you guys you get to read it I get to post it

Sheik has to rescue her little brother.

2244
02:38:54,720 --> 02:38:57,960
Anyway, who was it that played her?

2245
02:38:58,600 --> 02:38:59,740
Jennifer Connelly.

2246
02:38:59,740 --> 02:39:00,540
Yeah, Jennifer Connelly.

2247
02:39:01,400 --> 02:39:02,860
Next up.

2248
02:39:02,860 --> 02:39:06,200
I hope, just sorry to interrupt, but I hope Zex and Shadda is listening

2249
02:39:06,200 --> 02:39:09,460
because there is nothing better in this world than Labyrinth for him.

2250
02:39:10,960 --> 02:39:14,040
Labyrinth is, okay, I picked up the Superbit edition.

2251
02:39:14,100 --> 02:39:16,980
I think he would come in, if he's listening, I know he's going to come

2252
02:39:16,980 --> 02:39:18,780
in the chat room for once just to vote for that.

2253
02:39:19,540 --> 02:39:20,920
Well, that'd be cleans up after himself.

2254
02:39:20,920 --> 02:39:33,640
Next up, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Tim Curry, Best Singing Voice Ever, The Tattoo, and The

Anyway, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Polka Dots, Unladen Swallow.

2258
02:39:45,160 --> 02:39:47,160
Was it Africans Swallow or Europeans Swallow?

2259
02:39:47,160 --> 02:39:49,160
I don't know.

2260
02:39:49,160 --> 02:39:50,160
Anyway.

2261
02:39:50,160 --> 02:39:59,920
What was the guy's name who ran the sushi bar?

2262
02:39:59,920 --> 02:40:00,920
Sushi Fresh?

2263
02:40:00,920 --> 02:40:01,920
Or something?

2264
02:40:01,920 --> 02:40:02,920
G-Fresh.

2265
02:40:02,920 --> 02:40:03,920
It's all about G-Fresh.

2266
02:40:03,920 --> 02:40:06,920
Kill Bill.

2267
02:40:06,920 --> 02:40:11,680
Uma Thurman with a sword and being able to do wire work.

2268
02:40:11,680 --> 02:40:14,800
That was really impressive.

2269
02:40:14,800 --> 02:40:21,800
Kuriyama Chiaki as Go! Go! Yubari with her swinging ball of doom, and Sunny Chiba, speaking

2270
02:40:23,140 --> 02:40:30,140
very bad English. Your Japanese is good! Anyway, um, Chick, fuck if I know.

2271
02:40:33,900 --> 02:40:36,900
It's about two gay guys who are trying to find a place to screw.

2272
02:40:36,900 --> 02:40:41,900
I was making a mistake. Oh, okay. Oh, fuck if I know, I get it. Okay,

2273
02:40:41,900 --> 02:40:42,840
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2274
02:40:42,840 --> 02:40:44,440

02:40:54,540 --> 02:40:55,280
And clerks.

2280
02:40:55,920 --> 02:40:56,820
And girls who fart.

2281
02:40:58,680 --> 02:40:59,080
And nerds.

2282
02:40:59,440 --> 02:40:59,820
And nerds.

2283
02:41:00,520 --> 02:41:01,020
And clerks.

2284
02:41:02,600 --> 02:41:03,980
That's not supposed to be here today.

2285
02:41:04,860 --> 02:41:06,480
And rooftops, uh, hockey.

2286
02:41:08,120 --> 02:41:09,560

Yes, Death By Cocksucking.

2290
02:41:16,240 --> 02:41:17,620
And The Airplane Story.

2291
02:41:18,340 --> 02:41:22,380
All right, while those votes come in, we're going to take our last break of the night.

2292
02:41:22,380 --> 02:41:24,800
Any requests what we're going to do this break?

2293
02:41:24,800 --> 02:41:26,780
We want to do the anothers this break, right?

2294
02:41:27,040 --> 02:41:28,140
Okay, we're going to do the anothers.

2295
02:41:28,400 --> 02:41:32,600
So thank you, Zodiac Night, for saving my ass and sending this song to me.

2296
02:41:33,140 --> 02:41:33,740
Here it is.

2297
02:41:33,740 --> 02:41:39,760
Enjoy during this break while we tally the listless votes for a movie that you would most

2298
02:41:39,760 --> 02:41:41,080
like to see a video game made out of.

2299
02:41:41,080 --> 02:41:48,080
the definitive list coming back when we come back

2300
02:42:11,080 --> 02:42:15,080
...

2301
02:42:15,080 --> 02:42:19,080
...

2302
02:42:19,080 --> 02:42:23,080
...

2303
02:42:23,080 --> 02:42:27,080
...

2304
02:42:27,080 --> 02:42:31,080
...

2305
02:42:31,080 --> 02:42:35,080
...

2306
02:42:35,080 --> 02:42:39,080
...

2307
02:45:09,080 --> 02:45:29,000
This is fucked up!

2308
02:46:09,080 --> 02:46:16,080
Oh, this is bad.

2309
02:46:16,080 --> 02:46:22,080
Fucked up.

2310
02:46:22,080 --> 02:46:29,080
This is fucked up This is fucked up

2311
02:46:52,080 --> 02:47:21,080
I know the suspense is killing you but here it is the definitive list as decided by us

2312
02:47:21,080 --> 02:47:23,720
Loki, Clark, and Skye.

2313
02:47:23,720 --> 02:47:26,400
And a little help from the chat room.

2314
02:47:26,400 --> 02:47:30,520
www.calibilmani.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.

2315
02:47:30,520 --> 02:47:32,800
All right, here it is.

2316
02:47:32,800 --> 02:47:38,520
The top three movies you would like to see made into a game.

2317
02:47:38,520 --> 02:47:42,560
Number three, Kill Bill.

2318
02:47:42,560 --> 02:47:45,720
A lot of people, when they were voting, said, you know, I was going to vote for

2319
02:47:45,720 --> 02:47:48,460
Kill Bill, but I think they're going to make that into a game anyway.

2320
02:47:48,460 --> 02:47:49,560
You guys are probably right.

2321
02:47:49,560 --> 02:47:53,400
I would say on this entire list, Kill Bill is the one I think is most likely going to

2322
02:47:53,400 --> 02:47:54,400
be a game, if anything.

2323
02:47:54,400 --> 02:47:55,400
We'll see.

2324
02:47:55,400 --> 02:47:58,480
But Tarantino is such a big nerd that I could see it happening.

2325
02:47:58,480 --> 02:48:01,080
So, but Kill Bill is your number three pick.

2326
02:48:01,080 --> 02:48:05,000
But there were two films on this list you want to see even more than Kill Bill.

2327
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:09,000
And number two is Clerks.

2328
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:10,000
Clerks the Game.

2329
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:15,800
Yep, so you guys want to just be lazy in your video games as well as your real life, I guess.

2330
02:48:15,800 --> 02:48:18,000
Because there wouldn't be a lot to do in Clerks the Game.

2331
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:23,000
The animated series would be fun, I think. So, there it is, Clerks the Game.

2332
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:29,000
And your number one pick, I think this is pretty much a no-brainer, you guys, Battle Royale the Game.

2333
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:38,000
Best, I mean this could be a Doom killer right here. Fuck Quake, Fuck Doom, Battle Royale would be where it's at.

2334
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
I don't know, so they should make a Quake mod.

2335
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:47,000
I talked to someone who was actually trying to do an encounter strike, but of course it wasn't really going to work.

2336
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:50,480
So there you go, the list has decided by you and us.

2337
02:48:50,480 --> 02:48:51,520
There's no disputing it.

2338
02:48:51,520 --> 02:48:52,160
That is it.

2339
02:48:52,160 --> 02:48:56,640
That's the list of movies that most need to be a game.

2340
02:48:56,640 --> 02:48:59,800
OK, so now that we're back, we haven't even really

2341
02:48:59,800 --> 02:49:03,960
referenced this yet in the show, but Loki would like to

2342
02:49:03,960 --> 02:49:07,800
share with you this new game he downloaded this week.

2343
02:49:07,800 --> 02:49:12,000
And Loki, you want to tell us a little more about this?

2344
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,880
First off, the chair is being attacked by the microphone

2345
02:49:14,880 --> 02:49:17,260
again

2346
02:49:17,260 --> 02:49:19,300
maybe that should be a movie or a game

2347
02:49:19,300 --> 02:49:25,820
attack of the killer microphone cord

2348
02:49:25,820 --> 02:49:26,700
you ok there?

2349
02:49:26,700 --> 02:49:28,140
you need some help?

2350
02:49:28,140 --> 02:49:31,620
you gonna make it?

2351
02:49:31,620 --> 02:49:34,700
you're just in the middle of traffic i think is what happens to it

2352
02:49:34,700 --> 02:49:41,700
i was the one sitting in it and i didn't do anything she was spinning around and around and around

2353
02:49:41,700 --> 02:49:43,700
Okay.

2354
02:49:43,700 --> 02:49:49,700
You're okay, Loki. You gonna make it? You gonna be okay? Alright, he's ready. He's ready to tell you all about the game.

2355
02:49:49,700 --> 02:49:50,700
I thought I was on camera.

2356
02:49:50,700 --> 02:49:53,700
I am safe. Okay.

2357
02:49:53,700 --> 02:49:56,700
Um, this game is...

2358
02:49:56,700 --> 02:50:05,700
This company's answer to DDR. Yes, this game will take the world by storm and you will never know what DDR is. You'll just go, oh my god, this game rocks.

2359
02:50:05,700 --> 02:50:08,700
At least that's what they would like to think.

2360
02:50:08,700 --> 02:50:11,700
This game is called Tap-A-Jam.

2361
02:50:11,700 --> 02:50:13,980
Tap-A-Jam.

2362
02:50:13,980 --> 02:50:17,180
And Tap-A-Jam is, well, it's interesting.

2363
02:50:21,140 --> 02:50:22,860
Tap-A-Jam loading.

2364
02:50:22,860 --> 02:50:27,260
And what wonderful songs can you expect in Tap-A-Jam?

2365
02:50:27,260 --> 02:50:28,220
Well, let's see.

2366
02:50:28,220 --> 02:50:29,540
It's all public domain music.

2367
02:50:29,540 --> 02:50:36,420
So we have wonderful songs like Cannon and E.

2368
02:50:36,420 --> 02:50:39,780
Fight of the Bumblebee

2369
02:50:39,780 --> 02:50:42,500
Wow, these are top quality songs, you guys.

2370
02:50:42,500 --> 02:50:45,940
Moonlight Sonata

2371
02:50:45,940 --> 02:50:47,980
Blue Denimy

2372
02:50:47,980 --> 02:50:50,220
Danube

2373
02:50:50,220 --> 02:50:52,860
Simon Says Disco Fingers

2374
02:50:52,860 --> 02:50:55,740
Who knows what that is?

2375
02:50:55,740 --> 02:50:57,860
And more shit

2376
02:50:57,860 --> 02:50:58,900
Oh, and Chopsticks

2377
02:50:58,900 --> 02:51:01,020
Yes, Chopsticks

2378
02:51:01,020 --> 02:51:07,180
And you can see Loki and I are so mature when we play at our high score table.

2379
02:51:07,180 --> 02:51:11,580
Asses in first place and cunts in second place.

2380
02:51:11,580 --> 02:51:13,660
Because we're so mature.

2381
02:51:13,660 --> 02:51:16,180
Okay, so now we're going to show the game here.

2382
02:51:16,180 --> 02:51:18,380
We'll get Jamie's reaction.

2383
02:51:18,380 --> 02:51:19,980
And I'll describe it for our listeners.

2384
02:51:19,980 --> 02:51:26,980
Basically, I changed the controls, sorry guys.

2385
02:51:26,980 --> 02:51:33,980
Ah! Basically you have this up, down, left, right arrow, but it's on the left side of the screen.

2386
02:51:33,980 --> 02:51:37,980
So we've had, you know, we've had DDRs at the top, Beat Manias at the bottom.

2387
02:51:37,980 --> 02:51:40,980
Well, now we have a game where it's on the left side of the screen.

2388
02:51:40,980 --> 02:51:43,980
And so you have the up, left, right, and down arrows.

2389
02:51:44,980 --> 02:51:46,980
It's left, Loki. That one's left.

2390
02:51:46,980 --> 02:51:47,980
Ah, okay.

2391
02:51:47,980 --> 02:51:48,980
And then right and down.

2392
02:51:48,980 --> 02:51:58,980
And as the notes scroll over to the left, you have to hit them when they come in this column, is the way this works.

2393
02:51:58,980 --> 02:52:01,980
Okay, what happened to my mouse? There it goes.

2394
02:52:01,980 --> 02:52:02,980
Okie dokie.

2395
02:52:02,980 --> 02:52:05,980
And what website can they download this from, Loki?

2396
02:52:05,980 --> 02:52:06,980
It's at like...

2397
02:52:06,980 --> 02:52:07,980
That you really want to?

2398
02:52:07,980 --> 02:52:12,980
It's like a game house, is what it's at. Just do a search for tapa jam.

2399
02:52:12,980 --> 02:52:17,980
It's like, oh my god, beatbox bonus feature. I didn't see this before.

2400
02:52:17,980 --> 02:52:20,980
Oh, a beatbox bonus feature, huh?

2401
02:52:20,980 --> 02:52:24,980
Oh, it's, it's... just go, go to the game.

2402
02:52:24,980 --> 02:52:31,980
It's like a music generator, it's gay.

2403
02:52:31,980 --> 02:52:32,980
Alright.

2404
02:52:32,980 --> 02:52:37,980
So he's gonna play this, so...

2405
02:52:37,980 --> 02:52:44,980
And it even has a little wavelength in the bottom of the screen, so it's like instead of pretty videos, you get waves like Winamp.

2406
02:52:44,980 --> 02:52:51,980
listen to loki make that sweet music

2407
02:53:00,380 --> 02:53:03,420
aren't you happy? doesn't this game make you just

2408
02:53:03,420 --> 02:53:07,220
go mini! go in that base, yeah!

2409
02:53:07,220 --> 02:53:09,020
do do do do do do do do

2410
02:53:09,020 --> 02:53:12,540
i feel like breaking down, come on

2411
02:53:12,540 --> 02:53:19,540
Give me your thoughts.

2412
02:53:23,360 --> 02:53:26,940
Actually, combo, oh my god!

2413
02:53:26,940 --> 02:53:30,900
Okay, okay. Perfect.

2414
02:53:30,900 --> 02:53:38,080
I think this is an interesting way to get around having to license any song.

2415
02:53:38,080 --> 02:53:42,020
They just put in a bunch of classical songs.

2416
02:53:42,020 --> 02:53:45,020
That's a pretty smart idea. Hey, we like our classical songs, don't we?

2417
02:53:45,020 --> 02:53:51,020
But, um, I think we like our classical songs better when the renditions don't suck ass.

2418
02:53:51,020 --> 02:53:57,020
When they're played by an orchestra and not some $2 Casio keyboard from Walmart.

2419
02:54:02,020 --> 02:54:03,020
Ah!

2420
02:54:03,020 --> 02:54:08,020
So if you've ever wanted to play BeatMania in the comfort of your own home, go buy a BeatMania machine.

2421
02:54:08,020 --> 02:54:10,020
Do not settle for this shit.

2422
02:54:10,020 --> 02:54:14,020
This is, I think, sort of as a guitar freak show.

2423
02:54:14,020 --> 02:54:16,020
Oh, Loki failed Chopsticks!

2424
02:54:16,020 --> 02:54:19,020
It's because I'm running the camera software.

2425
02:54:19,020 --> 02:54:22,020
It's like, the notes are all, like, one size fails and jump.

2426
02:54:22,020 --> 02:54:26,020
If you thought night style had bad lag, try playing tap and jam with the camera.

2427
02:54:26,020 --> 02:54:28,020
Ugh.

2428
02:54:28,020 --> 02:54:30,020
But anyways, yeah, this game sucks.

2429
02:54:30,020 --> 02:54:32,020
But isn't this interesting?

2430
02:54:32,020 --> 02:54:34,020
Here, this ties into what we were talking about last week.

2431
02:54:34,020 --> 02:54:36,020
We were talking about, you know,

2432
02:54:36,020 --> 02:54:41,020
this into the groove thing is going to get its pants suit off of it because it's copying Konami.

2433
02:54:41,020 --> 02:54:46,020
Well, shit! This is a blatant rip-off of BeatMania if I've ever seen one.

2434
02:54:46,020 --> 02:54:53,020
I mean, they've differed it enough, but it's still, it's shit! It's not even a good rip-off.

2435
02:54:53,020 --> 02:54:57,020
This sounds like shit. Stop broadcasting this shit on the radio.

2436
02:54:57,020 --> 02:55:02,020
We have little enough listeners as it is.

2437
02:55:02,020 --> 02:55:04,580
And, oh, I only get seven more sessions.

2438
02:55:05,300 --> 02:55:06,520
They only limit me to ten.

2439
02:55:06,520 --> 02:55:08,460
I think I'm going to go be violently ill.

2440
02:55:08,460 --> 02:55:09,840
Oh, it's at gamehouse.com.

2441
02:55:09,840 --> 02:55:10,880
That's where you can find it at.

2442
02:55:11,880 --> 02:55:13,260
And what other games do they have?

2443
02:55:13,540 --> 02:55:14,140
They have Collapse.

2444
02:55:14,140 --> 02:55:15,640
Somebody posted a link in our chat room.

2445
02:55:15,640 --> 02:55:17,060
A tiger posted that for you guys.

2446
02:55:18,200 --> 02:55:19,000
Yeah, lame.

2447
02:55:25,600 --> 02:55:25,840
Well.

2448
02:55:25,840 --> 02:55:28,180
This is what happens when people start making.

2449
02:55:28,180 --> 02:55:37,180
This is what, if they have problems licensing music, and if we're into the groove, this is what it's going to be like.

2450
02:55:37,180 --> 02:55:44,180
Yeah, we're going to have MIDI sounding classical pieces, and we'll get to dance to Chopsticks and the Beganoob.

2451
02:55:44,180 --> 02:55:46,180
I'd like to play the one song real quick that I...

2452
02:55:46,180 --> 02:55:49,180
This is Utopia, this is one of the songs that's going to be into the groove.

2453
02:55:49,180 --> 02:55:50,180
Sure, go for it.

2454
02:55:50,180 --> 02:55:52,180
And I didn't really like it that much, but you know...

2455
02:55:52,180 --> 02:55:55,180
Alright, we'll let our listeners judge for themselves.

2456
02:55:55,180 --> 02:55:59,180
This is by Kaa, which is Gil's new name if I'm not mistaken.

2457
02:55:59,180 --> 02:56:03,180
Smiley is the name that I think he's under for this one, you know, he's doing the Naoki thing.

2458
02:56:03,180 --> 02:56:04,180
How cute.

2459
02:56:04,180 --> 02:56:06,180
And, um, well here it is.

2460
02:56:06,180 --> 02:56:09,180
Alright, judge for yourself, here's Utopia from Into the Groove.

2461
02:56:09,180 --> 02:56:11,180
I always think of the Madonna song.

2462
02:56:11,180 --> 02:56:13,180
Okay, come on.

2463
02:56:13,180 --> 02:56:15,180
I can't get away from being Madonna.

2464
02:56:45,180 --> 02:56:46,180
Let's go!

2465
02:56:46,180 --> 02:56:47,180
Let's go!

2466
02:56:47,180 --> 02:56:48,180
Let's go!

2467
02:56:48,180 --> 02:56:49,180
Let's go!

2468
02:56:49,180 --> 02:56:56,180
Let's go, let's go!

2469
02:57:49,180 --> 02:58:17,180
Let's go, let's go Let's go, let's go

2470
02:58:17,180 --> 02:58:21,200
That was Utopia by Kaa, Smiley, Keel, whatever the name is.

2471
02:58:21,200 --> 02:58:23,620
It's a song that's going to be an Into the Groove.

2472
02:58:24,800 --> 02:58:25,760
You guys' thoughts?

2473
02:58:25,760 --> 02:58:29,300
Loki, I know you already said you didn't like it, so I thought we'd see Jamie's thoughts.

2474
02:58:29,960 --> 02:58:33,420
Jamie's curled up in a little ball going to sleep, so you don't think you'd want

2475
02:58:33,420 --> 02:58:34,540
to dance to that one, Jamie?

2476
02:58:36,560 --> 02:58:37,860
No, not much.

2477
02:58:38,200 --> 02:58:43,360
I think, I think, Loki, I think you guys are being a little hard on it.

2478
02:58:43,360 --> 02:58:44,600
I think it's a good song.

2479
02:58:44,600 --> 02:58:52,120
The problem is, it's a good song, but it's badly produced.

2480
02:58:52,120 --> 02:58:57,420
And I'm not blaming the author for this, because I think he's very talented and he's writing

2481
02:58:57,420 --> 02:58:58,420
good music.

2482
02:58:58,420 --> 02:59:01,740
I think he's just probably very limited in what he's able to write, because he probably

2483
02:59:01,740 --> 02:59:07,380
only has so much equipment, but I think with an actual recording studio, if this guy worked

2484
02:59:07,380 --> 02:59:09,780
for Konami, I think the song would be sweet.

2485
02:59:09,780 --> 02:59:13,420
I think it would have the better sampling.

2486
02:59:13,420 --> 02:59:17,300
I think you were exactly right when you said it sounds like a MIDI.

2487
02:59:17,300 --> 02:59:20,540
I think the sampling he's using is not good.

2488
02:59:20,540 --> 02:59:21,700
It's kind of a poor choice.

2489
02:59:21,700 --> 02:59:25,200
The piano sounds a little too MIDI-ish to me.

2490
02:59:25,200 --> 02:59:28,100
I think if he had the right equipment, it would be a kick-ass song.

2491
02:59:28,100 --> 02:59:30,780
I think it would be better produced, basically, is what it is.

2492
02:59:30,780 --> 02:59:33,900
I think it's a good song, badly produced.

2493
02:59:33,900 --> 02:59:36,100
I just don't think that it's a dancing game.

2494
02:59:36,100 --> 02:59:39,480
It just doesn't seem like something I would enjoy playing.

2495
02:59:39,480 --> 02:59:40,480
It's a good song.

2496
02:59:40,480 --> 02:59:43,300
I just don't think I'd enjoy playing it.

2497
02:59:43,300 --> 02:59:45,860
I almost see it more as like a 2DX song, in a way.

2498
02:59:45,860 --> 02:59:47,260
I think if it were more...

2499
02:59:47,260 --> 02:59:50,820
It's funny you should mention that, because it's like a 12-footer in this damn game, so

2500
02:59:50,820 --> 02:59:52,340
the steps are like 2DX.

2501
02:59:52,340 --> 02:59:53,340
You know what?

2502
02:59:53,340 --> 02:59:57,780
And see, that's just going to ruin the song even more, to throw it away on these 12-footers

2503
02:59:57,780 --> 02:59:58,780
and stuff.

2504
02:59:58,780 --> 03:00:01,260
I mean, that's just...

2505
03:00:01,260 --> 03:00:04,100
It's stupid.

2506
03:00:04,100 --> 03:00:05,220
There's no need for it.

2507
03:00:05,220 --> 03:00:06,220
Come on.

2508
03:00:06,220 --> 03:00:07,220
You're going to have...

2509
03:00:07,220 --> 03:00:12,220
Why don't you have a couple 11-footers to kill people, you know, but stick to Fun Steps.

2510
03:00:12,220 --> 03:00:13,620
That song could have some fun steps.

2511
03:00:13,620 --> 03:00:15,040
I think that song could have some really fun steps.

2512
03:00:15,040 --> 03:00:20,140
What they're saying is like they have like a maniac level or whatever and already 10

2513
03:00:20,140 --> 03:00:22,860
of the songs have like 11 and 12 player steps.

2514
03:00:23,040 --> 03:00:25,140
I think the problem is people are trying to think,

2515
03:00:25,140 --> 03:00:29,340
people think that the way they can squeeze more life out of DDR is to make it harder.

2516
03:00:29,980 --> 03:00:32,980
And it's just kind of like, you know what, the human body is going to reach a point.

2517
03:00:32,980 --> 03:00:35,920
And there's a point where it's just not going to be fun for the rest of us anymore.

2518
03:00:35,920 --> 03:00:41,640
You're making the game to satisfy the 1% of people who could pass max period on the first try.

2519
03:00:41,640 --> 03:00:48,480
I'm sorry, but in my eyes, Max Period is no fun at all.

2520
03:00:48,480 --> 03:00:51,400
It's a bad DDR song because it's no fun at all.

2521
03:00:51,400 --> 03:00:56,420
Speeding a song up to 600 beats per minute at the end, that's stupid.

2522
03:00:56,420 --> 03:00:58,720
It's inhuman and doable.

2523
03:00:58,720 --> 03:01:02,440
It's too bad.

2524
03:01:02,440 --> 03:01:03,440
And the song sucks.

2525
03:01:03,440 --> 03:01:04,440
That's a big factor.

2526
03:01:04,440 --> 03:01:05,460
It's a big factor, you know.

2527
03:01:06,180 --> 03:01:12,460
If they're going to do hard ones this long, at least these would be good.

2528
03:01:12,460 --> 03:01:16,440
Okay. Well, any other, any other thoughts on this?

2529
03:01:16,760 --> 03:01:23,100
Any other thoughts on Into the Groove, Tap a Jam,

2530
03:01:23,100 --> 03:01:25,600
any other DDR knockoffs we need to address while we're here?

2531
03:01:26,500 --> 03:01:29,660
I'm just thinking that we can do it way better.

2532
03:01:29,840 --> 03:01:32,040
And like I said, I'm going to take my attempt at it.

2533
03:01:32,040 --> 03:01:34,400
So we'll work on it.

2534
03:01:34,400 --> 03:01:37,880
As I said last week, I'm going to try pushing that and seeing

2535
03:01:37,880 --> 03:01:40,960
if an arcade will take my idea.

2536
03:01:40,960 --> 03:01:44,920
I'm just saying, you could do it a lot better than what

2537
03:01:44,920 --> 03:01:46,760
you're doing right now.

2538
03:01:46,760 --> 03:01:49,480
Whatever, but that's fine.

2539
03:01:49,480 --> 03:01:52,700
I mean, I understand that they have their limitations with

2540
03:01:52,700 --> 03:01:55,840
going the legal route, but a lot of people don't care about

2541
03:01:55,840 --> 03:01:56,460
the legal route.

2542
03:01:56,460 --> 03:01:57,960
That's why the DVR machines are here.

2543
03:01:57,960 --> 03:02:03,560
So, that's the way you've got to look at it.

2544
03:02:04,160 --> 03:02:07,880
Joe Womma wanted to make a point, kind of defending max period a little bit, I guess,

2545
03:02:07,880 --> 03:02:09,600
or whatever, playing devil's advocate.

2546
03:02:09,920 --> 03:02:13,580
How many people play max 300 on two speed, he says, because that's just

2547
03:02:13,580 --> 03:02:15,400
as bad as 600 beats per minute.

2548
03:02:16,020 --> 03:02:18,480
Honestly, I've seen one or two.

2549
03:02:18,560 --> 03:02:20,860
I've not seen that many people that brave it on two speed.

2550
03:02:20,860 --> 03:02:27,260
I mean, some people do it for the challenge, but I don't really see it

2551
03:02:27,260 --> 03:02:28,980
as something practical.

2552
03:02:28,980 --> 03:02:31,060
Most people that do it on two-speed honestly

2553
03:02:31,060 --> 03:02:31,860
haven't memorized it.

2554
03:02:31,860 --> 03:02:32,780
They've played it so goddamn hard.

2555
03:02:32,780 --> 03:02:35,900
Here's the thing is, people don't like BPM-doubled songs,

2556
03:02:35,900 --> 03:02:37,740
songs that the steps are going quite well.

2557
03:02:37,740 --> 03:02:39,820
Yeah, because honestly, Max 300 is only supposed to be 150

2558
03:02:39,820 --> 03:02:40,660
beats per minute.

2559
03:02:40,660 --> 03:02:42,060
Yeah, I mean, we understand that.

2560
03:02:42,060 --> 03:02:42,980
And same with Dropout.

2561
03:02:42,980 --> 03:02:44,060
Dropout's the same way.

2562
03:02:44,060 --> 03:02:46,540
And I understand they go with the bass line on it.

2563
03:02:46,540 --> 03:02:51,020
And they do the bass line goes in eighth notes or whatever

2564
03:02:51,020 --> 03:02:52,540
for max period, not one point.

2565
03:02:52,540 --> 03:02:53,980
And that's why it goes 600.

2566
03:02:53,980 --> 03:02:58,240
But the only reason, the steps for max.period aren't that

2567
03:02:58,240 --> 03:02:59,760
hard, it's just so hard to read.

2568
03:02:59,760 --> 03:03:01,400
It's just stupid.

2569
03:03:01,400 --> 03:03:03,560
And the steps in the beginning are stupid too, because it's

2570
03:03:03,560 --> 03:03:04,640
just jumping.

2571
03:03:04,640 --> 03:03:06,560
It's tons of jumping.

2572
03:03:06,560 --> 03:03:08,320
No one likes that, it's just retarded.

2573
03:03:08,320 --> 03:03:12,680
That's true, a lot of step files in Turnamix 4 got reamed

2574
03:03:12,680 --> 03:03:13,960
for that, right?

2575
03:03:13,960 --> 03:03:16,000
Too many weird jokes and stuff.

2576
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:18,120
If that were a step file in Turnamix 4, they would be

2577
03:03:18,120 --> 03:03:22,320
bitching, it wouldn't have even made it into the final.

2578
03:03:22,320 --> 03:03:25,840
They would just be laughed off as first off being a horrible

2579
03:03:25,840 --> 03:03:29,680
Max remix, and then two, they would have been like, oh, well

2580
03:03:29,680 --> 03:03:32,480
this is the step file for this is stupid, why did you double

2581
03:03:32,480 --> 03:03:33,760
the BPM at the very end?

2582
03:03:33,760 --> 03:03:35,320
That's retarded.

2583
03:03:35,320 --> 03:03:36,960
They would have laughed at that thing.

2584
03:03:36,960 --> 03:03:41,560
I don't even know why they did that.

2585
03:03:41,560 --> 03:03:44,160
I don't really think they know what they're doing as far as

2586
03:03:44,160 --> 03:03:46,040
step files go.

2587
03:03:46,040 --> 03:03:47,280
I don't think they know what they're doing.

2588
03:03:47,280 --> 03:03:50,880
I don't think they know what their customers want.

2589
03:03:50,880 --> 03:03:55,140
And so, they're looking at symphyls, unfortunately looking at really shitty ones,

2590
03:03:55,600 --> 03:03:57,560
and they're like, well, people like this.

2591
03:03:57,740 --> 03:03:59,420
So, this is what they're doing.

2592
03:03:59,680 --> 03:04:00,980
It just doesn't make any sense.

2593
03:04:03,500 --> 03:04:08,000
Okay. I guess at this point now, we'll open it up for final thoughts

2594
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:09,640
of the evening, because that's about it.

2595
03:04:09,640 --> 03:04:14,220
Actually, I did want to say, though, Jamie, have a safe trip, fly safe, have fun in Alabama,

2596
03:04:14,220 --> 03:04:17,740
have twice as much fun for me, three times as much, so Loki's covered, too,

2597
03:04:18,180 --> 03:04:19,520
because California's going to suck.

2598
03:04:19,520 --> 03:04:23,040
I know, it'll suck until I get back.

2599
03:04:24,220 --> 03:04:27,560
No, I'll have a good time, you know, I'm going to see my family.

2600
03:04:28,020 --> 03:04:31,680
Hope they don't drive me completely insane by the time I get back.

2601
03:04:32,480 --> 03:04:36,440
But, and I'm going to have, I'm going to have my child with me.

2602
03:04:37,880 --> 03:04:44,020
So, flying sort of parallel flights, so we're going to have lots of hanging out time.

2603
03:04:44,020 --> 03:04:48,420
So it's a girls trip out to Alabama, that should be fun.

2604
03:04:49,020 --> 03:04:50,480
All right, final thoughts of the evening.

2605
03:04:50,760 --> 03:04:51,660
No, I was just thinking.

2606
03:04:51,660 --> 03:04:54,400
Oh, I was just thinking kind of a question opposed to a chat room.

2607
03:04:54,400 --> 03:04:59,480
Sure. If you were to like say go to your normal arcade, you've got like, you know,

2608
03:04:59,480 --> 03:05:03,900
your DVR extreme has been there forever and say it was upgraded with something that was homemade

2609
03:05:04,480 --> 03:05:07,860
but not necessarily like, you know, into the group or its own things.

2610
03:05:07,960 --> 03:05:12,100
Like say someone puts StepMania on there and put like a bunch of like, you know,

2611
03:05:12,100 --> 03:05:14,780
of the old tracks and some of the new tracks, would you be

2612
03:05:14,780 --> 03:05:18,100
that against it if it was a pretty decent

2613
03:05:18,100 --> 03:05:19,580
collection of songs?

2614
03:05:19,580 --> 03:05:22,300
Are you going to be all pissed off that it's just its own

2615
03:05:22,300 --> 03:05:25,060
independent software and not an official Konami thing?

2616
03:05:25,060 --> 03:05:28,980
Or are you just going to be like, hey, this is cool?

2617
03:05:28,980 --> 03:05:30,980
Because that's what I'm getting at.

2618
03:05:30,980 --> 03:05:33,260
I'm just trying to see if people would be so pissed off

2619
03:05:33,260 --> 03:05:38,120
at having a well put together set of songs, but not

2620
03:05:38,120 --> 03:05:40,980
official, because this is into the groove stuff.

2621
03:05:40,980 --> 03:05:45,560
If it was a well put together set of songs, it might be all right, but I don't know.

2622
03:05:46,220 --> 03:05:49,340
Just a little question to throw on there and, you know, discuss.

2623
03:05:50,380 --> 03:05:53,420
All right, well, let's go on and get final thoughts and we'll see

2624
03:05:53,420 --> 03:05:55,460
if there's any answers to that when we get back.

2625
03:05:55,700 --> 03:05:59,560
Somebody wanted to share their final thought with us, somebody who's going

2626
03:05:59,560 --> 03:06:05,260
by the nickname of Skywhore, thank you, thanks, that's great, says their final thought is

2627
03:06:05,260 --> 03:06:08,780
that 2DX has met its match with TapaJam.

2628
03:06:08,780 --> 03:06:11,780
Have another bud, buddy!

2629
03:06:13,780 --> 03:06:16,780
A. You're my whore, for Christ's sake.

2630
03:06:16,780 --> 03:06:26,780
B. No, 2DX has met its match with the, um, I would love to see a mix of songs, like, to do, like, just kind of like an independent thing.

2631
03:06:26,780 --> 03:06:30,780
Have the artist from 2DX and have, like, some of the homebrew artists.

2632
03:06:30,780 --> 03:06:37,300
He has some of the home brew artists fight against each other like, you know,

2633
03:06:37,300 --> 03:06:38,900
like kind of a DJ battle type thing.

2634
03:06:38,900 --> 03:06:42,320
Because there's a lot of home brew artists out there that make really kickass songs

2635
03:06:42,400 --> 03:06:45,400
and animations that go with them, so.

2636
03:06:45,840 --> 03:06:47,480
All right.

2637
03:06:47,800 --> 03:06:49,860
Well, I'm looking to see in the chat room if there's any response

2638
03:06:49,860 --> 03:06:51,380
to your hypothetical question to them.

2639
03:06:51,380 --> 03:06:52,100
And there is not.

2640
03:06:52,500 --> 03:06:53,240
Nobody cares.

2641
03:06:53,240 --> 03:06:55,000
So I guess it's time to end the show.

2642
03:06:55,460 --> 03:06:56,440
Loki, your final thought?

2643
03:06:56,440 --> 03:07:03,440
My final thought is I better get working on my show this week, so I don't have to do it the same day as I usually do.

2644
03:07:03,440 --> 03:07:04,440
Tune in what day?

2645
03:07:04,440 --> 03:07:05,440
Wednesday.

2646
03:07:05,440 --> 03:07:06,440
What time?

2647
03:07:06,440 --> 03:07:08,440
It'll be at seven.

2648
03:07:08,440 --> 03:07:10,440
Sounds good. Jamie, your final thought?

2649
03:07:12,440 --> 03:07:17,440
I have to get up at four in the fucking morning.

2650
03:07:17,440 --> 03:07:19,440
Oh, I'm sorry, final thought.

2651
03:07:19,440 --> 03:07:24,160
thought don't forget my shows gonna be on Monday and Tuesday I'm gonna be on a

2652
03:07:24,160 --> 03:07:31,720
plane so just hope that I don't die or something and that's it

2653
03:07:33,920 --> 03:07:44,360
my final thought is I have nothing more to say that's it Jamie you're gonna have

2654
03:07:44,360 --> 03:07:46,860
the word tonight because I know you enjoy always getting the word and

2655
03:07:46,860 --> 03:07:50,860
You're going to be gone for a couple of weeks, so here you go.

2656
03:07:50,860 --> 03:07:53,580
We go.

2657
03:07:53,580 --> 03:07:56,380
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2658
03:07:56,380 --> 03:08:00,780
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sabra, Sky, and Loki.

2659
03:08:00,780 --> 03:08:03,060
We expect you a nice play again.

2660
03:08:03,060 --> 03:08:06,420
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2661
03:08:06,420 --> 03:08:10,100
Well, I object to all this sex on the television.

2662
03:08:10,100 --> 03:08:12,820
I mean, I keep falling off.

2663
03:08:12,820 --> 03:08:15,360
Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2664
03:08:45,360 --> 03:08:57,360
Orange Lounge Radio, the afterbirth, the part after the credits have crawled across the screen and everything you think has come to an end, but it's still going.

2665
03:08:57,360 --> 03:09:00,360
Loki, you did finally get some feedback to your hypothetical situation you posed.

2666
03:09:00,360 --> 03:09:02,360
Okay.

2667
03:09:02,360 --> 03:09:08,360
I think, Zodiac Knight says, I think the potential for any DDR homebrew lies in the song selection.

2668
03:09:08,360 --> 03:09:12,360
Okay. Sounds good.

2669
03:09:12,360 --> 03:09:15,720
zodiac night also says i would take a look at it at least

2670
03:09:15,720 --> 03:09:17,100
give it a try

2671
03:09:17,100 --> 03:09:21,000
the thing i'm concerned about is i want to do this and i think we might have the

2672
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:23,100
potential to actually put it in the arcade

2673
03:09:23,100 --> 03:09:24,700
but i'm thinking people

2674
03:09:24,700 --> 03:09:27,000
are going to go and see it and they're going to get

2675
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:28,880
go like on ddr free and go

2676
03:09:28,880 --> 03:09:32,520
oh my god i saw this in the arcade and people were getting pissed off

2677
03:09:32,520 --> 03:09:35,440
and now i'm just going to be bitchy about that

2678
03:09:35,440 --> 03:09:38,920
it's kinda ironic that the people that like the game so much would actually

2679
03:09:38,920 --> 03:09:41,940
ruin it for themselves

2680
03:09:41,940 --> 03:09:44,380
But interesting thought.

2681
03:09:44,380 --> 03:09:49,460
Pixie Dust says, I suck at DDR, but I'd still try it.

2682
03:09:49,460 --> 03:09:50,380
OK.

2683
03:09:50,380 --> 03:09:51,740
Because, like I said.

2684
03:09:51,740 --> 03:09:54,580
So I think everybody's kind of like, OK, I'll try it.

2685
03:09:54,580 --> 03:09:55,580
I'll try it once.

2686
03:09:55,580 --> 03:09:59,140
I'll try it once, twice if I like it.

2687
03:09:59,140 --> 03:10:00,860
Three times to be sure, exactly.

2688
03:10:00,860 --> 03:10:01,360
OK.

2689
03:10:01,360 --> 03:10:02,820
Well, if they had good music, then I

2690
03:10:02,820 --> 03:10:04,420
suppose it would take off and work.

2691
03:10:04,420 --> 03:10:07,260
So that's what I'll have to work on.

2692
03:10:07,260 --> 03:10:08,260
I'll have to work on it.

2693
03:10:08,260 --> 03:10:09,900
You should use my evil edits.

2694
03:10:09,900 --> 03:10:13,360
No Stylin says, no Stylin says he's going to miss you, Jamie.

2695
03:10:13,760 --> 03:10:16,140
And he's going to miss, pump up the volume as well.

2696
03:10:16,620 --> 03:10:17,780
Well, it'll still be playing.

2697
03:10:17,780 --> 03:10:18,860
You'll get to hear some of the old ones.

2698
03:10:19,400 --> 03:10:25,320
And, you know, maybe, maybe the Tuesday night I get back, if I'm not like dead to the world,

2699
03:10:25,320 --> 03:10:26,900
I'll toss on some Eurobeat for you.

2700
03:10:27,300 --> 03:10:30,380
I have a couple things I was going to be planning.

2701
03:10:31,460 --> 03:10:34,220
Livewire for the 19th of November.

2702
03:10:34,220 --> 03:10:38,380
I'm going to have to do something special for that, some Bomani related thing.

2703
03:10:38,380 --> 03:10:46,600
And then, what was it, also I think, I don't know,

2704
03:10:46,600 --> 03:10:49,040
might try to do something special for New Year's.

2705
03:10:49,160 --> 03:10:50,820
I don't know, depending on what I'm doing.

2706
03:10:52,700 --> 03:10:54,060
We should do something on New Year's.

2707
03:10:54,060 --> 03:10:55,360
What day is New Year's?

2708
03:10:55,980 --> 03:10:58,300
I do something every New Year's though.

2709
03:10:58,740 --> 03:11:01,440
Yeah, I'm thinking if anything runs on New Year's,

2710
03:11:01,440 --> 03:11:03,200
it's going to be taped because I don't want to be here.

2711
03:11:03,360 --> 03:11:06,740
We always do an anime marathon and get really drunk.

2712
03:11:06,740 --> 03:11:10,940
Yeah, I'm thinking I want to go out and get wasted because I didn't get to do it for Halloween,

2713
03:11:10,940 --> 03:11:13,940
so I'm going to be doing it for New Year's.

2714
03:11:13,940 --> 03:11:16,260
You can come get wasted with me, Loki.

2715
03:11:16,260 --> 03:11:17,460
Come on.

2716
03:11:17,460 --> 03:11:20,340
Drunk Rob is awesome, isn't it?

2717
03:11:20,340 --> 03:11:26,240
Drunk Rob is funny, Mr. Piñata.

2718
03:11:26,240 --> 03:11:29,140
I got called by somebody drunk last night three times.

2719
03:11:29,140 --> 03:11:34,280
I won't embarrass them on the air by saying who it is, but it was really funny.

2720
03:11:34,280 --> 03:11:35,280
It was great.

2721
03:11:35,280 --> 03:11:36,280
And he called today to apologize.

2722
03:11:36,280 --> 03:11:42,040
I'm like you don't have to apologize you're funny this is cool so it's funny

2723
03:11:42,040 --> 03:11:50,960
drunk people are hilarious you know what what I I you've seen me get drunk but I

2724
03:11:50,960 --> 03:11:53,800
don't think I'm funny when I'm drunk because it doesn't last

2725
03:11:53,800 --> 03:12:00,280
ah you've been funny when you're drunk oh just I've seen you I've seen you be

2726
03:12:00,280 --> 03:12:04,000
funny when you're drunk I go around giving other people drinks because I

2727
03:12:04,000 --> 03:12:06,120
I want them to be as junk as me.

2728
03:12:06,120 --> 03:12:13,120
People are calling on the phone, not realizing we're trying to do a show in this house.

2729
03:12:18,900 --> 03:12:21,980
Who's the goober that called?

2730
03:12:21,980 --> 03:12:26,820
Yeah, I can have him call you.

2731
03:12:26,820 --> 03:12:29,460
Who was the goober that called?

2732
03:12:29,460 --> 03:12:31,540
That was Matt, so you can yell at him.

2733
03:12:31,540 --> 03:12:37,700
are you still doing that? Yeah, we are. It's only been 67 weeks now, I think. Yeah, we're

2734
03:12:37,700 --> 03:12:43,580
still doing it. Oh my God, you guys, we've been doing this for 67 weeks. We have technically

2735
03:12:43,580 --> 03:12:49,980
been doing it for 69 weeks because we've had our two. True, we had two tape shows. Technically,

2736
03:12:49,980 --> 03:12:57,060
technically, technically, this is the 69th show. So you are here after all. But the way

2737
03:12:57,060 --> 03:13:00,660
We've been counting 69 is coming up in a couple of those are half episodes. Yeah

2738
03:13:01,180 --> 03:13:06,580
This is it's so weird you guys I can I don't I can remember back to the first episode

2739
03:13:08,860 --> 03:13:11,340
Well, I already said when we hit a hundred I'm quitting

2740
03:13:13,580 --> 03:13:18,180
We're gonna keep going all right, we'll keep going we're gonna be geriatric and

2741
03:13:19,060 --> 03:13:23,300
PC just wants to take me to LA for New Year's. I'm down with that. I

2742
03:13:23,300 --> 03:13:27,120
I want to go, I want to go, I want to go far away for New Year's.

2743
03:13:27,120 --> 03:13:27,860
I want to travel.

2744
03:13:27,860 --> 03:13:29,320
I want to have money and travel.

2745
03:13:29,320 --> 03:13:30,100
That's what I'm going to do.

2746
03:13:30,100 --> 03:13:35,520
Yeah, but I want a cookie, but I can't have that.

2747
03:13:35,520 --> 03:13:39,900
All right, your post-show tonight is going to be a recycled preshow,

2748
03:13:39,900 --> 03:13:42,140
one of Jamie's old preshows, and it's one I like.

2749
03:13:42,880 --> 03:13:45,020
So I've decided that that's going to be tonight's post-show.

2750
03:13:45,020 --> 03:13:46,320
Oh, and which one, pray tell?

2751
03:13:46,420 --> 03:13:49,120
It is the one with all the Svensson and Gielin mixes.

2752
03:13:49,120 --> 03:13:50,160
Oh, that one was fun.

2753
03:13:50,240 --> 03:13:51,020
Yes, it was.

2754
03:13:51,020 --> 03:13:57,020
So, um, oh wait, now I'm curious, now before I get into the post-show, somebody says, Joe Mama says,

2755
03:13:57,020 --> 03:14:04,020
The first episodes were fun. Did we jump the shark or something? What's wrong with the recent episodes?

2756
03:14:04,020 --> 03:14:10,020
I think there's, like, like a fine wine we've improved with age.

2757
03:14:10,020 --> 03:14:12,020
I don't know, I've been noticing that.

2758
03:14:12,020 --> 03:14:14,020
Or, like, a mold gotten bigger.

2759
03:14:14,020 --> 03:14:16,020
I've been less bitter lately.

2760
03:14:16,020 --> 03:14:21,500
And it's like I get to Sunday and I'm already like relaxed like I'll be angry all throughout the week

2761
03:14:21,500 --> 03:14:23,740
And I just kind of calm down on the weekend

2762
03:14:24,340 --> 03:14:27,460
It's not because I'm getting laid more anything. It's just because I

2763
03:14:27,980 --> 03:14:31,980
Don't know. It's just calming. I'm the only one not getting laid. I should be the bitter one

2764
03:14:32,900 --> 03:14:38,060
But even when I wasn't I was I mean even when I was I was still getting I was still bitter

2765
03:14:38,060 --> 03:14:42,000
It's just like I think I don't go out enough and get like people

2766
03:14:42,000 --> 03:14:46,160
pissing me off enough or it's the same people pissing me off so it's like yeah

2767
03:14:46,160 --> 03:14:51,560
been there so has orange lounge radio jumped the shark yet you think or you

2768
03:14:51,560 --> 03:14:56,920
think we still got a ways to go I'm very scared to think of 23 makers with a man

2769
03:14:56,920 --> 03:15:04,200
slut well now oh I see Joe mama is thinking back to those days when only

2770
03:15:04,200 --> 03:15:07,960
like six people frequented our chat room during the shows and now we have and we

2771
03:15:07,960 --> 03:15:12,960
We just didn't give a fuck, and guess what, we still don't give a fuck.

2772
03:15:12,960 --> 03:15:16,960
Yeah, I mean the number of people has never been that important to us.

2773
03:15:16,960 --> 03:15:22,960
I mean, because obviously if we were numbers, we don't get that many people in retrospect to listen to the show.

2774
03:15:22,960 --> 03:15:26,960
But in internet radio terms, quite a few actually.

2775
03:15:26,960 --> 03:15:29,960
Quite a few for an internet radio show, which is...

2776
03:15:29,960 --> 03:15:31,960
We are loved.

2777
03:15:31,960 --> 03:15:33,960
And we have all you guys to thank.

2778
03:15:33,960 --> 03:15:36,740
it's getting bigger every week I see new faces coming in the chat room it's

2779
03:15:36,740 --> 03:15:44,220
awesome it's awesome and we love you guys I'm sorry that you haven't gotten

2780
03:15:44,220 --> 03:15:53,180
laid that's pixie dust I know I'm sorry that you haven't gotten laid you come

2781
03:15:53,180 --> 03:15:59,460
over pixie dust I show you good time I'll show your boobs some loving people

2782
03:15:59,460 --> 03:16:01,560
You don't need to get laid to be happy.

2783
03:16:01,940 --> 03:16:05,240
Some people are perfectly happy being asexual.

2784
03:16:05,420 --> 03:16:11,340
But, but, but getting laid definitely like takes the little like hyper dog out of you,

2785
03:16:11,340 --> 03:16:14,260
you know, it's just like mellow.

2786
03:16:14,260 --> 03:16:18,940
And to be honest, I can think of a few people that could use a little mellowy.

2787
03:16:20,060 --> 03:16:28,080
Sorry. You know what, I'm sorry, but getting laid just does one thing for me.

2788
03:16:28,080 --> 03:16:29,100
It makes me want ice cream.

2789
03:16:30,040 --> 03:16:30,460
That's it.

2790
03:16:30,860 --> 03:16:31,800
Just remember.

2791
03:16:32,480 --> 03:16:35,860
Yes, could I order vanilla cream with an orgasm mix in?

2792
03:16:35,860 --> 03:16:38,840
No, come back here and make your comment on the air.

2793
03:16:38,840 --> 03:16:39,560
That was great.

2794
03:16:39,680 --> 03:16:40,480
That was brilliant.

2795
03:16:41,980 --> 03:16:45,600
Just remember, without sex, Ben and Jerry's wouldn't be doing so well.

2796
03:16:47,760 --> 03:16:49,160
Orange cream, anyone?

2797
03:16:50,140 --> 03:16:53,560
What else am I thinking of here?

2798
03:16:53,560 --> 03:16:54,300
Vanilla chunk.

2799
03:16:54,300 --> 03:17:00,300
I don't know, it had something to do with the show, but I guess it wasn't that bad.

2800
03:17:00,300 --> 03:17:05,300
Oh, I know what it is. I know what it is. It actually has nothing to do with the show. It has to do with getting laid, which is even better than the show.

2801
03:17:05,300 --> 03:17:07,300
It has to do with the show.

2802
03:17:07,300 --> 03:17:13,300
You know what? For some people, some people don't need to get laid. Some people just want to cuddle.

2803
03:17:13,300 --> 03:17:15,300
Aww.

2804
03:17:17,300 --> 03:17:21,300
There was a funny line in, um, what was it, in, um,

2805
03:17:21,300 --> 03:17:24,300
Boondock Saints, where they're talking about cuddling,

2806
03:17:24,300 --> 03:17:27,300
because the one, uh, cop who's the perfect investigator,

2807
03:17:27,300 --> 03:17:30,300
and he's, he's a gay guy, but he acts like a straight guy.

2808
03:17:30,300 --> 03:17:32,300
It's kind of weird, it's like this guy's trying to cuddle with him,

2809
03:17:32,300 --> 03:17:34,300
he's like, what the fuck you want? You want to cuddle?

2810
03:17:34,300 --> 03:17:38,300
He's like, man, you're so gay, and he, like, gets up and walks away.

2811
03:17:38,300 --> 03:17:40,300
That was funny.

2812
03:17:55,300 --> 03:17:57,300
Alright, let's get it, alright.

2813
03:17:57,300 --> 03:17:59,300
The bear's been getting it on!

2814
03:17:59,300 --> 03:18:04,300
Alright, um, that's it. We're gonna go into Poshaw now.

2815
03:18:04,300 --> 03:18:09,300
It's, uh, Benjamin Guillen music, started off with a little bit of Ayumi Hamasaki, huh?

2816
03:18:09,300 --> 03:18:11,300
Would depend on you, I can't wait to mute these microphones.

2817
03:18:11,300 --> 03:18:14,300
Say goodbye to the, say goodbye to the ferrets, Jamie.

2818
03:18:14,300 --> 03:18:19,300
They're coming with me! You can't take them back, you'll never see!

2819
03:18:19,300 --> 03:18:21,300
Oh wait

2820
03:19:19,300 --> 03:19:21,300
Oh

2821
03:19:49,300 --> 03:19:51,300
Oh

2822
03:25:19,300 --> 03:25:28,300
I'm gonna take some time to lose my way

2823
03:25:28,300 --> 03:25:35,300
From the dark to the light to the sun and light

2824
03:25:35,300 --> 03:25:40,300
Put your hands in the air

2825
03:25:40,300 --> 03:25:56,700
Put your hand in my hand.

2826
03:25:56,700 --> 03:26:04,500
Put your hand in my hand.

2827
03:26:04,500 --> 03:26:07,500
my head

2828
03:26:07,500 --> 03:26:11,000
Let me show you the way

2829
03:26:11,000 --> 03:26:14,500
and you will understand

2830
03:26:14,500 --> 03:26:17,500
Let me show you the way

2831
03:26:17,500 --> 03:26:21,500
with your hands in my hand

2832
03:26:21,500 --> 03:26:24,500
Let me show you the way

2833
03:26:24,500 --> 03:26:29,000
and you will understand

2834
03:26:29,000 --> 03:26:33,000
Oh, shove you away

2835
03:26:43,000 --> 03:26:47,000
Oh, shove you away

2836
03:27:47,000 --> 03:28:15,680
Down the trees, down the alley, down the trees, any way

2837
03:28:15,680 --> 03:28:22,680
I'm gonna die to the light of the ocean in the dark

2838
03:28:22,680 --> 03:28:29,680
I'm gonna die to the pain of the future in the rain

2839
03:28:29,680 --> 03:28:36,680
I'm gonna die to the light of the ocean in the dark

2840
03:28:36,680 --> 03:28:42,680
You're running right

2841
03:28:42,680 --> 03:28:47,680
You're running right in my head

2842
03:28:47,680 --> 03:28:50,680
Let me show you

2843
03:28:50,680 --> 03:28:54,680
What you have in my head

2844
03:28:54,680 --> 03:28:57,680
Let me show you

2845
03:28:57,680 --> 03:29:02,680
The way that you will never die

2846
03:29:02,680 --> 03:29:04,680
Show you the way

2847
03:29:04,680 --> 03:29:08,680
Show you the way, show you the way

2848
03:29:08,680 --> 03:29:12,680
I'm taking you

2849
03:29:12,680 --> 03:29:16,680
I'm taking you

2850
03:29:16,680 --> 03:29:20,680
I'm taking you

2851
03:29:20,680 --> 03:29:24,680
Put your hand in my hand

2852
03:29:24,680 --> 03:29:28,680
Show you the way

2853
03:29:28,680 --> 03:29:32,680
And you will understand

2854
03:29:32,680 --> 03:29:37,680
You don't like it when you see a better day than the things that I wear

2855
03:31:37,680 --> 03:31:39,680
You
