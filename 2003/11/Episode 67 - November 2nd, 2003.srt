[SPEAKER_13]: Don't bring the cats.

154
00:09:55,098 --> 00:09:55,718
[SPEAKER_13]: Pull up a chair.

155
00:09:55,758 --> 00:09:57,619
[SPEAKER_13]: Get ready to listen, listen, listen.

Thanks for watching!

163
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:10,391
[SPEAKER_00]: Rock over London, rock over Chicago, Orange Lounge Radio.

164
00:14:10,591 --> 00:14:13,671
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good place to listen to the music.

165
00:14:17,372 --> 00:14:23,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, everybody, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 67, now in progress.

166
00:14:23,974 --> 00:14:24,114
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

167
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, tell me about... I'm going to go sit in the living room so I can show up on cam, because otherwise the cam's very boring.

168
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:44,045
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to... If you want to join us on cam, head on over to our chatroom, www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on chat.

169
00:14:44,165 --> 00:14:48,026
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the chatroom, by the way, chatroom is up on the television screen, so we can all see what you're saying.

170
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:50,027
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to molest them.

171
00:14:50,107 --> 00:14:51,628
[SPEAKER_09]: It's interactive when you're in our chatroom.

172
00:14:53,317 --> 00:14:59,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, but first tell us, I want everybody to know about these games that you brought to the show tonight, because they're pretty cool.

173
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:03,759
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to molest the chat room, sorry.

174
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:04,279
[SPEAKER_09]: That's alright.

175
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:07,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'll put them up on, the cam's updating, right?

176
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:09,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, once in a while.

177
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you have to explain for those that aren't going to be on the cam.

178
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,281
[SPEAKER_06]: I am an old school gaming freak.

179
00:15:15,901 --> 00:15:16,661
[SPEAKER_06]: I love old games.

180
00:15:17,461 --> 00:15:18,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing wrong with that.

181
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:22,302
[SPEAKER_06]: When Dan and I discovered that Sega was kind enough to...

182
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:26,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Release updated versions of their older games.

183
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,161
[SPEAKER_06]: We hopped right on it and grabbed our three favorites.

184
00:15:28,602 --> 00:15:28,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.

185
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:32,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, one of them was backordered, so we're still waiting for a Phantasy Star collection.

186
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:33,426
[SPEAKER_02]: No surprise there.

187
00:15:33,486 --> 00:15:35,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, this is a remake of the first Phantasy Star.

188
00:15:36,028 --> 00:15:38,911
[SPEAKER_06]: If anyone ever played it on the Master System, you know what I'm talking about.

189
00:15:39,211 --> 00:15:39,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

190
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:45,516
[SPEAKER_06]: But they put out another two games that are probably about my second and third favorite game ever.

191
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:47,058
[SPEAKER_09]: And what will be the first game ever?

192
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:48,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Guardian Legend.

193
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,742
[SPEAKER_06]: I seriously doubt that's ever going to get a release.

194
00:15:51,782 --> 00:15:58,427
[SPEAKER_06]: But the first one I'm putting up on cam right now is probably my other favorite game like ever.

195
00:15:58,667 --> 00:15:59,868
[SPEAKER_09]: And for those that can't see the cam.

196
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,411
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to get to where it'll adjust.

197
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:05,012
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Fantasy Zone.

198
00:16:06,513 --> 00:16:08,474
[SPEAKER_06]: The game that brought us the Opa Opa.

199
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:11,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is this cute little ship with angel wings.

200
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:12,317
[SPEAKER_06]: With feet.

201
00:16:12,618 --> 00:16:14,379
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you're on the gun he has little legs.

202
00:16:15,223 --> 00:16:16,423
[SPEAKER_06]: and he's super cute.

203
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:19,524
[SPEAKER_06]: See, there it is on the camera, Fantasy Zone.

204
00:16:19,884 --> 00:16:24,865
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the other awesome game... It's funny because the way you held it up, you still have Loki on part of the picture.

205
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:28,046
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't get it up there.

206
00:16:28,126 --> 00:16:30,807
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a very blurry picture of Space Harrier up there now.

207
00:16:31,467 --> 00:16:31,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me see.

208
00:16:31,987 --> 00:16:33,007
[SPEAKER_06]: This may be a little bit better.

209
00:16:33,247 --> 00:16:33,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

210
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:35,888
[SPEAKER_09]: So Space Harrier being the other game, which is...

211
00:16:36,468 --> 00:16:43,433
[SPEAKER_09]: For those that may not recognize Space Harrier by name, because I didn't at first, I kind of had to get visuals of these games.

212
00:16:43,453 --> 00:16:44,594
[SPEAKER_09]: So let me kind of describe them for you.

213
00:16:44,654 --> 00:16:48,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Fantasy Zone is like this beautiful... It's sort of like Defender.

214
00:16:48,477 --> 00:16:51,339
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like Defender, but in beautiful, beautiful pastels.

215
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,121
[SPEAKER_09]: And I never thought I'd... It's like happy music.

216
00:16:53,261 --> 00:16:58,284
[SPEAKER_09]: I never thought I'd refer to pastels as a beautiful thing, but Fantasy Zone really pulls it off.

217
00:16:58,345 --> 00:17:00,206
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like uber cute in the way it's painted.

218
00:17:00,246 --> 00:17:01,487
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like a color by number.

219
00:17:01,727 --> 00:17:11,272
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you're watching, when you're looking at, you know, dead on, it looks like it's fully 2D, but they're really actually flat, self-shaded polygons.

220
00:17:11,592 --> 00:17:24,039
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of the point I wanted to get to about these re-releases, is that they didn't just... Now, it's not like a Namco Museum game or an Atari Museum game where they just took the old games, put them on a CD, and emulated them, basically.

221
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,679
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

222
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,060
[SPEAKER_09]: They took these games...

223
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:26,921
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura,

224
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:48,189
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't like huge fans of them like Jamie was when they were first out, but I remember playing Fantasy Zone.

225
00:17:48,209 --> 00:17:49,150
[SPEAKER_09]: I ran it at one weekend.

226
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:57,201
[SPEAKER_09]: I played it on the Nintendo where it looked like barf because the color palette isn't the same as it is on a Sega, so it looks all messed up.

227
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:10,532
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason why is that the Nintendo was not set up for pastel color, where the Master System was.

228
00:18:11,393 --> 00:18:16,897
[SPEAKER_09]: So I played them and they looked like barf, but coming back now and playing them again, I'm just like, oh my god, this is so beautiful.

229
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:22,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Finally, we're using a next generation system to make our 2D games look even better.

230
00:18:22,721 --> 00:18:23,682
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so cool.

231
00:18:24,322 --> 00:18:29,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear 8-bit companies like Nintendo, anybody that was big in the 8-bit days, even Konami.

232
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:35,711
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be nice to have Super Konami World Collection 3D.

233
00:18:36,231 --> 00:18:38,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, I want you all to take up this project.

234
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:44,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Do your old 2D games in 3D like this, because they are so cool.

235
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:45,994
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, oh man.

236
00:18:46,374 --> 00:18:52,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially when you're going to release one of these old, kind of like old school game packs, and re-release it as like a new thing.

237
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:54,379
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, oh, it's so beautiful.

238
00:18:54,979 --> 00:18:55,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Words can't express.

239
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,642
[SPEAKER_06]: They also come with another little neat thing.

240
00:18:59,002 --> 00:19:04,505
[SPEAKER_06]: If you bought the special edition of Phantasy Star, which we actually didn't get, it came with a little binder.

241
00:19:05,406 --> 00:19:08,608
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the binder, you would put these cards in.

242
00:19:09,688 --> 00:19:10,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

243
00:19:10,469 --> 00:19:14,551
[SPEAKER_06]: That are basically just description of the game, some of the history of it.

244
00:19:14,711 --> 00:19:18,113
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm putting the Winter Fantasy Zone up on the cam.

245
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:19,193
[SPEAKER_09]: That's still kind of neat, though.

246
00:19:21,234 --> 00:19:25,677
[SPEAKER_06]: So... But they're also, they're bringing out more games.

247
00:19:25,717 --> 00:19:36,243
[SPEAKER_06]: The ones that are out right now in the series is there was, of course, Fantasy Star, Space Harrier, Fantasy Zone, Monaco GP...

248
00:19:37,784 --> 00:19:41,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Goldnax is pretty.

249
00:19:43,786 --> 00:19:54,510
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a site, actually if you go to the live journal community Girl Gamers and just look for my post, I put a big post there about it with a link to the Japanese site

250
00:19:55,313 --> 00:20:00,455
[SPEAKER_06]: where you can watch a streaming video of screens from the first five releases.

251
00:20:00,715 --> 00:20:03,876
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking you need to make that a cross post to the Orange Lounge community.

252
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:06,297
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go look for my own post.

253
00:20:06,337 --> 00:20:06,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Good idea.

254
00:20:07,397 --> 00:20:19,541
[SPEAKER_06]: But the next ones that are coming out, and actually I didn't find this out until I looked for the pre-orders on Lixing, but the next one out is Columns.

255
00:20:20,858 --> 00:20:22,899
[SPEAKER_06]: and then the other one, I don't remember what it is.

256
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:24,419
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a game that didn't come out over here.

257
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,760
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll have to check out.

258
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my God.

259
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:30,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Please tell me they're going to do Alex Kidd.

260
00:20:31,121 --> 00:20:31,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Wouldn't it be nice?

261
00:20:34,622 --> 00:20:36,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Alex Kidd was a Sega game, wasn't it?

262
00:20:36,823 --> 00:20:38,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it was.

263
00:20:38,964 --> 00:20:41,345
[SPEAKER_06]: What would be really cool is if... And Shinobi?

264
00:20:41,905 --> 00:20:43,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they did Shinobi.

265
00:20:44,486 --> 00:20:47,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but okay, I'm not counting the new Shinobi.

266
00:20:47,206 --> 00:20:48,867
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what actually I think would be cool?

267
00:20:48,887 --> 00:20:48,967
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

268
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,012
[SPEAKER_08]: and Michael Jackson Moonwalker.

269
00:20:56,232 --> 00:20:56,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.

270
00:20:57,393 --> 00:20:57,614
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

271
00:20:57,754 --> 00:20:57,974
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

272
00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:00,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Skywalker was kind of 3D to begin with.

273
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:05,614
[SPEAKER_09]: It was one of those cheap, it was still a 2D game, but it was 3D.

274
00:21:06,034 --> 00:21:09,417
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like the Ninja Turtles where you can move up and down, but you know what?

275
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:10,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this is what I was thinking.

276
00:21:10,438 --> 00:21:13,039
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how in Sonic Adventure 2, how they had the bonus?

277
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,243
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the remake of the Green Hill Zone from the first Sonic game.

278
00:21:19,104 --> 00:21:23,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Wouldn't it be cool if they took the original Sonic games and did them like that?

279
00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:25,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

280
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:41,846
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, of course, this was just kind of brought up, I think this was brought up in the chat room, I think this is where I saw it, but my very favorite old school Sega game of all time, they badly need to do this port to, Altered Beast.

281
00:21:42,266 --> 00:21:43,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Rise from your grave.

282
00:21:45,327 --> 00:21:48,229
[SPEAKER_09]: I cannot wait for them to do Altered Beast like this.

283
00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:48,969
[SPEAKER_09]: This is...

284
00:21:50,072 --> 00:22:05,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Man, I'm just picturing, I'm kind of picturing, I'm going back to Castlevania, because for those who were listening to Vanilla Sky on Monday, we were talking about the new Castlevania, and kind of got into a discussion on like, you know, is Castlevania good, or what have you, because of the 3D-ness of it now.

285
00:22:06,002 --> 00:22:06,822
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just thinking, oh my god.

286
00:22:06,842 --> 00:22:11,025
[SPEAKER_06]: And why would she play it in Japanese without the shitty US voice acting?

287
00:22:11,685 --> 00:22:13,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, that's so much crap.

288
00:22:13,863 --> 00:22:19,951
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just go back and think, oh my god, what if Simon's Quest were done like this Fantasy Zone thing is?

289
00:22:20,411 --> 00:22:21,353
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have an orgasm.

290
00:22:23,045 --> 00:22:25,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Sega has always been really smart with their games.

291
00:22:25,607 --> 00:22:34,131
[SPEAKER_06]: They've just had, you know, bad advertising and, you know, going up against basically a major monopoly like, you know, Sony is.

292
00:22:34,572 --> 00:22:44,838
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they say that they didn't have, you know, take from their other facilities, but you can tell they put major money behind the PlayStation, even though the Saturn to this day is still a better system.

293
00:22:46,018 --> 00:22:49,940
[SPEAKER_06]: The Dreamcast to this day has still had better games than many PS2s.

294
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,422
[SPEAKER_09]: You will go to your grave, a Sega fangirl.

295
00:22:53,263 --> 00:22:54,945
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I used to be a Nintendo fangirl, 100%.

296
00:22:56,506 --> 00:23:00,871
[SPEAKER_06]: And now, my whole support of Nintendo comes just because Sega's supporting them.

297
00:23:02,012 --> 00:23:09,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't it so weird now to fire up a game like F-Zero and you see on the first screen, Sega Nintendo?

298
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:15,586
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, wow, ten years ago, you're picturing those ads in your mind, Sega does what Nintendo don't.

299
00:23:15,606 --> 00:23:16,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what?

300
00:23:17,428 --> 00:23:25,251
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember on one of my tapes, one of my old tapes off Japanese TV, watching the monkeys, these two little monkeys playing TV.

301
00:23:25,951 --> 00:23:31,913
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of them was playing a Saturn, playing Burning Rangers on the Saturn, if this dates this for you.

302
00:23:32,373 --> 00:23:38,075
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other one was playing like some other game on, like an older crappy game on the PlayStation.

303
00:23:38,615 --> 00:23:40,576
[SPEAKER_06]: And the PlayStation monkey went to go play the Saturn.

304
00:23:41,565 --> 00:23:43,546
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to address something that came up in the chat room.

305
00:23:43,586 --> 00:23:46,228
[SPEAKER_09]: We have some new chatters tonight, so hello to all our new folks.

306
00:23:46,288 --> 00:23:47,849
[SPEAKER_09]: We love seeing some new faces in our chat room.

307
00:23:48,189 --> 00:23:55,454
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a guy named Bargle who says, is a little bit disgusted by the thought of me having an orgasm over a game.

308
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:56,394
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

309
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,816
[SPEAKER_09]: There is nothing better than an orgasm.

310
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:02,018
[SPEAKER_09]: You name me one thing in this world that's better than an orgasm.

311
00:24:02,198 --> 00:24:02,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Two orgasms.

312
00:24:03,459 --> 00:24:04,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Two orgasms.

313
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Loki.

314
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:05,980
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

315
00:24:07,201 --> 00:24:08,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Really good ice cream.

316
00:24:10,501 --> 00:24:19,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe if you're a woman, but... If I was sitting between the best orgasm ever and a bowl of chocolate decadence blue belt ice cream.

317
00:24:20,165 --> 00:24:21,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Chocolate orgasm.

318
00:24:22,406 --> 00:24:22,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh.

319
00:24:27,208 --> 00:24:28,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, and this may be TMI.

320
00:24:28,589 --> 00:24:30,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I give that a cold stone?

321
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:35,892
[SPEAKER_06]: The best, actually the best, best thing ever is the bowl of ice cream you eat after an orgasm.

322
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:38,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Is to go out

323
00:24:39,594 --> 00:24:40,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck a bunch.

324
00:24:41,775 --> 00:24:42,996
[SPEAKER_04]: And then eat a bowl of ice cream.

325
00:24:43,377 --> 00:24:45,038
[SPEAKER_09]: For some, it's the cigarettes.

326
00:24:45,118 --> 00:24:46,358
[SPEAKER_09]: For some, it's the ice cream.

327
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:47,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I don't smoke.

328
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:56,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Next time I'm going to go into Cold Stone, I'm going to be all, yeah, could I get the, I'd like to get the vanilla cream with the orgasm mix in.

329
00:24:59,647 --> 00:25:07,092
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we need to sit and create, call it the Orange Lounge Orgasm at Cold Stone.

330
00:25:08,858 --> 00:25:11,400
[SPEAKER_06]: and keep and like put the right number in it.

331
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, like write it in and stuff?

332
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they don't have those anymore.

333
00:25:13,521 --> 00:25:13,841
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

334
00:25:14,582 --> 00:25:16,082
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to put mine in.

335
00:25:17,882 --> 00:25:22,644
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to have my cherry cheesecake flavor that I just called the DarkSakura.

336
00:25:23,764 --> 00:25:24,285
[SPEAKER_02]: How original.

337
00:25:24,305 --> 00:25:35,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it was, you know, it was graham cracker, brownie, cheesecake, and cherry pie filling.

338
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,631
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so good and so bad for me.

339
00:25:39,151 --> 00:25:41,292
[SPEAKER_06]: I want ice cream now.

340
00:25:41,312 --> 00:25:44,033
[SPEAKER_09]: As good as that sounds, Jamie, orgasms are better.

341
00:25:47,441 --> 00:25:51,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway... Ice cream after... I think we got off on a little bit of a tangent there.

342
00:25:51,324 --> 00:25:51,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, kids.

343
00:25:52,044 --> 00:25:52,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey!

344
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:53,425
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we do here on Orange Honor.

345
00:25:53,445 --> 00:25:54,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the Fantasy Zone.

346
00:25:54,606 --> 00:25:54,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Get ready.

347
00:25:56,267 --> 00:25:58,309
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um... I was so happy because it's in there!

348
00:25:58,409 --> 00:25:59,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Does it actually have voice acting?

349
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:00,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah.

350
00:26:00,811 --> 00:26:02,392
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like... Okay, this is what happened.

351
00:26:02,752 --> 00:26:04,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish we could play it for the chat room, but we really can't.

352
00:26:05,474 --> 00:26:12,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but, um... When you're, um... It's like, when you start off the game, it doesn't say the Welcome to the Fantasy Zone, get ready.

353
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:14,180
[SPEAKER_06]: At least the first time it did it.

354
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,822
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like... Like...

355
00:26:17,572 --> 00:26:19,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Get Ready, Harrier, or something like that.

356
00:26:19,614 --> 00:26:20,134
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet you were pissed.

357
00:26:20,214 --> 00:26:21,035
[SPEAKER_09]: And then go for it.

358
00:26:21,095 --> 00:26:22,396
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet you were pissed when you heard that.

359
00:26:22,476 --> 00:26:22,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I was.

360
00:26:23,036 --> 00:26:28,940
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, like, four games later, you know, watching Dan play it the other night, it finally said it.

361
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,642
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were like, ah.

362
00:26:31,362 --> 00:26:35,965
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember when I first ever, like, saw your post back on DDR Freak.

363
00:26:36,066 --> 00:26:38,788
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember that was your signature, welcome to the Fantasy Zone, get ready.

364
00:26:39,168 --> 00:26:41,950
[SPEAKER_09]: And I always thought it was actually from Fantasy Zone.

365
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:48,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the thing is that Space Harrier is set in the same universe as Fantasy Zone.

366
00:26:50,695 --> 00:26:52,116
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a lot of people don't realize that.

367
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:53,997
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you've mentioned that to me before.

368
00:26:54,537 --> 00:26:58,800
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at the original games, Fantasy Zone has the big plaid floors and everything.

369
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:04,383
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you have the checkered ground, and then the checkered ground is in Space Harrier, the originals.

370
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:21,013
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's set in the same universe although they made it completely different for these two they look completely different so here's my final thought on the whole 8-bit games being redone Guardian Legend Remake Guardian Legend Remake Dear Broderbund and who else put that game out?

371
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:34,200
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember Broderbund was the publisher of it please do a Guardian Legend Remake oh my god I would never leave the house ever it's done it would be more addicting you know there was there was a game that came out

372
00:27:35,325 --> 00:27:36,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Guardian Legend Online.

373
00:27:36,785 --> 00:27:37,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God.

374
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:38,726
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't know.

375
00:27:38,786 --> 00:27:40,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Guardian Legend is not a game to be played online.

376
00:27:40,607 --> 00:27:42,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Guardian Legend is a masturbatory game.

377
00:27:42,707 --> 00:27:44,027
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a solo experience.

378
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:46,388
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

379
00:27:46,448 --> 00:27:47,629
[SPEAKER_09]: They need to freaking do it.

380
00:27:47,689 --> 00:27:48,709
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a solo orgasm.

381
00:27:48,909 --> 00:27:50,389
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

382
00:27:50,589 --> 00:27:52,670
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the original survival horror game.

383
00:27:54,343 --> 00:27:55,885
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I'd call it a horror game

384
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,120
[SPEAKER_06]: But you have to go find weapons, you know.

385
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,501
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, she was doing it before Snake ever did his thing.

386
00:28:30,521 --> 00:28:31,481
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same thing, too.

387
00:28:32,121 --> 00:28:35,562
[SPEAKER_06]: It's tactical survival espionage horror shooting game.

388
00:28:36,042 --> 00:28:52,505
[SPEAKER_09]: I always, I don't know if I'd go as far to say that it was this new genre of game that was fabulous, but what it did is it took two genres of existing games, like Zelda and Gradius, to kind of name two, more like Life Force, maybe, but took these two games and brought them together.

389
00:28:52,525 --> 00:28:53,425
[SPEAKER_09]: It was about as hard as Life Force.

390
00:28:54,205 --> 00:28:55,546
[SPEAKER_09]: So beautifully.

391
00:28:56,307 --> 00:29:00,911
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like going to a wedding and crying at the beautiful union of these two things.

392
00:29:01,231 --> 00:29:03,373
[SPEAKER_06]: And it had the little thingies from Adventure of Lolo.

393
00:29:04,514 --> 00:29:04,734
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

394
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:06,316
[SPEAKER_06]: The blue thingies from Adventure of Lolo.

395
00:29:08,432 --> 00:29:08,792
[SPEAKER_09]: It did.

396
00:29:09,252 --> 00:29:09,733
[SPEAKER_06]: They've had the shots.

397
00:29:09,753 --> 00:29:17,556
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think they were, I think they were supposed to be, they're related to the blue things from Zexys.

398
00:29:18,016 --> 00:29:20,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Z-E-Y-X-Z, that game, Zexys?

399
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:21,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

400
00:29:21,777 --> 00:29:24,018
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's related to those blue guys, not the Lolo guy.

401
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:25,519
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Lolo's a different blue guy.

402
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:29,140
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was like, hey, the guys from Adventure Lolo left.

403
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,020
[SPEAKER_06]: They're boycotting.

404
00:29:31,721 --> 00:29:34,182
[SPEAKER_06]: It was, and you know, it had really good music in it, too.

405
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:40,363
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also knew the trick where you could walk through the divider walls in the center.

406
00:29:40,723 --> 00:29:46,187
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like if you held your controller at an angle, you could walk through the wall and get to the other side.

407
00:29:46,207 --> 00:29:49,529
[SPEAKER_02]: 8-bit games are great.

408
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:52,651
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know the other neat controller trick was the one for Mega Man 3?

409
00:29:54,212 --> 00:29:58,414
[SPEAKER_06]: I submitted the thing to Nintendo Power way back when.

410
00:29:58,854 --> 00:30:01,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I was the first person I knew of that found this little trick.

411
00:30:02,837 --> 00:30:04,538
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, everyone knew about the double jump.

412
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,945
[SPEAKER_06]: In Mega Man 3, where you hold down your left and right and A button or something like that on the second controller.

413
00:30:11,866 --> 00:30:14,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I would put it on the floor and sit in a chair and hold it with my feet.

414
00:30:15,249 --> 00:30:21,894
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you fall down a hole and then you let go and then hit it again, you'll hear the die noise and then you can jump out of the hole.

415
00:30:22,555 --> 00:30:23,415
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have no life.

416
00:30:23,856 --> 00:30:24,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

417
00:30:25,497 --> 00:30:29,901
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can use, the only way that you can shoot anything is to use your special weapons.

418
00:30:31,202 --> 00:30:33,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Because your shot is also your life.

419
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:38,800
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you hit a power up, you know, a life refill, then you have to do the trick again.

420
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:46,202
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's really convenient when you're going against a boss and they can't kill you because you're already dead.

421
00:30:48,462 --> 00:30:52,203
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's, you know, I'm going off on a tangent right now.

422
00:30:52,363 --> 00:30:53,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray for digression.

423
00:30:54,184 --> 00:30:54,644
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.

424
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we need a topic change.

425
00:30:56,851 --> 00:30:59,954
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're going to be gone the next two weeks.

426
00:31:00,935 --> 00:31:01,496
[SPEAKER_09]: So what's going on?

427
00:31:02,036 --> 00:31:05,640
[SPEAKER_09]: For those that are just joining us tonight, because I know we have some new folks, what's going on?

428
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are you going to be leaving us the next couple of weeks?

429
00:31:07,121 --> 00:31:08,202
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to see my family.

430
00:31:08,263 --> 00:31:09,684
[SPEAKER_06]: The fifth is my mama's birthday.

431
00:31:11,265 --> 00:31:16,851
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very pissed off that this is going to go into the fuckies of the week because I can't buy my mom her Alan Jackson tickets because I can't afford them.

432
00:31:17,552 --> 00:31:17,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Awe.

433
00:31:18,312 --> 00:31:23,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I'm really not, you know, that upset about me missing Alan Jackson, but mom is really... Right.

434
00:31:24,418 --> 00:31:28,663
[SPEAKER_06]: And unless the credit card I signed up for arrives, I can't get her tickets.

435
00:31:29,824 --> 00:31:30,224
[SPEAKER_12]: Poopy.

436
00:31:32,306 --> 00:31:34,128
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I'm going to take her out to eat.

437
00:31:34,168 --> 00:31:35,389
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to try to do something nice.

438
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:48,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but the general itinerary is spending time with my family, spending time with my mama-san and papa-san, who were really, really good friends of mine who took care of me when I needed some place to stay.

439
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:55,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, going to my college and getting my transcripts, because, you know, technically I'm still enrolled at the University of South Alabama.

440
00:31:55,586 --> 00:31:58,168
[SPEAKER_09]: I technically, I'm still enrolled at a school in California, too.

441
00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:00,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, um,

442
00:32:01,903 --> 00:32:06,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Get a, have to get a SARS mask to go visit my mom's house because she and her husband both smoke.

443
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,331
[SPEAKER_06]: And also have a dog.

444
00:32:09,372 --> 00:32:10,754
[SPEAKER_06]: What am I super allergic to?

445
00:32:11,294 --> 00:32:12,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Cigar smoking dog.

446
00:32:13,537 --> 00:32:16,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't you, um, oh, I don't, um.

447
00:32:17,162 --> 00:32:18,543
[SPEAKER_06]: I smoked a while back.

448
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:19,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, but.

449
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:21,407
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was the cigars because I wasn't allergic to them.

450
00:32:22,904 --> 00:32:24,085
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think it's different.

451
00:32:24,205 --> 00:32:28,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Once you quit, like, it can... That was really stupid of me because I had asthma.

452
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,771
[SPEAKER_09]: It can really affect you.

453
00:32:30,171 --> 00:32:37,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, and I know that probably some people who are listening smoke, I know that some people do every so often.

454
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,484
[SPEAKER_06]: But I still think that's probably the most retarded thing anyone can do to themselves.

455
00:32:42,984 --> 00:32:44,506
[SPEAKER_06]: That, and it's also pretty...

456
00:32:45,346 --> 00:32:47,288
[SPEAKER_06]: and forgive me for saying so, this is how I feel about it.

457
00:32:47,588 --> 00:32:50,390
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also pretty inconsiderate of other people because you're poisoning their air.

458
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:52,151
[SPEAKER_06]: If you think about it.

459
00:32:52,491 --> 00:32:53,692
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to breathe the smoke.

460
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:55,953
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's another story.

461
00:32:56,394 --> 00:32:59,716
[SPEAKER_06]: And oh my god, I went to the casino and I thought I was going to die.

462
00:33:00,636 --> 00:33:01,497
[SPEAKER_06]: You went to the casino?

463
00:33:01,517 --> 00:33:06,340
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to Thunder Valley yesterday with Iguanago and Islander.

464
00:33:07,281 --> 00:33:08,602
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's weird about that casino?

465
00:33:08,622 --> 00:33:08,702
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

466
00:33:09,902 --> 00:33:10,603
[SPEAKER_09]: No arcade.

467
00:33:11,624 --> 00:33:12,525
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm such a dork.

468
00:33:13,205 --> 00:33:18,510
[SPEAKER_09]: The first time the casino opened up, I'm like, ooh, maybe there'll be a cool DDR machine because that's just what an addict I am.

469
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:21,312
[SPEAKER_09]: And no arcade to be found anywhere.

470
00:33:21,352 --> 00:33:25,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Where do the kids go when mommy and daddy go to gamble, which I know happens a lot.

471
00:33:25,696 --> 00:33:27,597
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that they lock them in the trunk.

472
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:31,981
[SPEAKER_06]: But the whole reason we went was to play bingo.

473
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:34,814
[SPEAKER_06]: They have bingo there?

474
00:33:34,854 --> 00:33:35,414
[SPEAKER_06]: They have bingo.

475
00:33:35,454 --> 00:33:35,994
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty fun.

476
00:33:36,074 --> 00:33:37,195
[SPEAKER_06]: When?

477
00:33:37,335 --> 00:33:41,137
[SPEAKER_06]: They do it once an hour, and it's basically like 45, 50 minutes of bingo.

478
00:33:42,218 --> 00:33:42,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy shit.

479
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:45,880
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do the electronic or you can do the paper play.

480
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,442
[SPEAKER_06]: In the paper play, you basically get twice as many cards.

481
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:50,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a separate room for bingo or something?

482
00:33:50,983 --> 00:33:53,385
[SPEAKER_06]: A big banquet, like a convention room.

483
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:55,546
[SPEAKER_10]: I have never seen the bingo room.

484
00:33:55,886 --> 00:33:57,487
[SPEAKER_06]: It says bingo in big old letters inside.

485
00:33:57,507 --> 00:34:03,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when you go in the door and head off to the right and around past the snack area, there's the bingo room.

486
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:11,078
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's $12 for the paper play and the lightning progressive round and the validation.

487
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,642
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's pretty fun, and, you know, I was really close to a blackout.

488
00:34:14,782 --> 00:34:15,983
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I was, like, three away.

489
00:34:16,543 --> 00:34:16,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

490
00:34:17,004 --> 00:34:19,967
[SPEAKER_06]: So... Did anybody win anything?

491
00:34:20,087 --> 00:34:20,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Did one of you get three?

492
00:34:20,988 --> 00:34:21,768
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we didn't win.

493
00:34:21,788 --> 00:34:22,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, bummer.

494
00:34:22,309 --> 00:34:22,789
[SPEAKER_06]: But I...

495
00:34:25,478 --> 00:34:29,739
[SPEAKER_06]: We went back to play on the slot machines, trying to earn money for the next game.

496
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:34,820
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just randomly sat down in front of a machine, put a dollar in it, and got $15.50 back.

497
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:35,640
[SPEAKER_12]: Cool.

498
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,461
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of those, you know, where you can play up to 15 lines or 9 lines or something.

499
00:34:39,481 --> 00:34:39,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

500
00:34:40,421 --> 00:34:50,083
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got, I only played one line, get this, I played one line, the middle line, and it was the one that's all like the poker faces.

501
00:34:50,423 --> 00:34:50,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

502
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:51,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Like 10 and up.

503
00:34:52,164 --> 00:34:53,844
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got all 10s across.

504
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:59,031
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually won like 17 off of it that I played a couple more rounds.

505
00:34:59,172 --> 00:35:06,234
[SPEAKER_09]: My future strategy for casinos, I've learned from LankyStyle, one of the folks you hear on Vanilla Sky, video poker is where it's at.

506
00:35:06,334 --> 00:35:11,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, when I was in Reno last time, the only place I made money was video poker, and that is all I'm ever going to play.

507
00:35:11,336 --> 00:35:12,517
[SPEAKER_06]: I lost all my video poker skills.

508
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:13,457
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what happened.

509
00:35:13,477 --> 00:35:14,818
[SPEAKER_09]: That is all I'm ever going to play in the future.

510
00:35:14,838 --> 00:35:19,999
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was in Vegas for the ZDF Week moderatorship, I was at the end of my money when we were leaving.

511
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:20,980
[SPEAKER_06]: I had...

512
00:35:21,881 --> 00:35:22,741
[SPEAKER_06]: 50 cents in my pocket.

513
00:35:23,642 --> 00:35:24,903
[SPEAKER_06]: And I turned it into $10.

514
00:35:26,485 --> 00:35:27,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I needed a cap there.

515
00:35:28,587 --> 00:35:32,070
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking at the chat room, some of the comments on bingo.

516
00:35:32,111 --> 00:35:35,073
[SPEAKER_09]: We have some folks that say they hate bingo.

517
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:37,476
[SPEAKER_09]: You get complimentary prune juice.

518
00:35:37,576 --> 00:35:41,099
[SPEAKER_09]: My grandma plays bingo with shuffleboard.

519
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it a lot of old people there playing bingo?

520
00:35:42,921 --> 00:35:44,783
[SPEAKER_06]: There were old people there, but there were a lot of young people too.

521
00:35:45,263 --> 00:35:46,184
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

522
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:57,674
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm noticing bingo seems to be like a younger and younger thing because we had a girl in one of my classes where I work and we asked everybody, you know, why are you hired at work and da-da-da, why did you decide to, you know, come to this place and work?

523
00:35:58,074 --> 00:36:00,896
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the girls actually said, I have to fund my bingo addiction.

524
00:36:02,198 --> 00:36:05,140
[SPEAKER_09]: And she, get this, she had a daughter in her purse.

525
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Not like a son and daughter, but like a bingo daughter.

526
00:36:08,443 --> 00:36:08,863
[SPEAKER_09]: A dauber.

527
00:36:09,063 --> 00:36:10,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe not a daughter, a dauber.

528
00:36:10,905 --> 00:36:13,087
[SPEAKER_09]: She had a dauber in her purse with her, always.

529
00:36:13,912 --> 00:36:15,594
[SPEAKER_09]: You think we're obsessed on this show.

530
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:24,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the thing is that they actually have, you know, they've got sight machines, but they also have, like, soda fountain machines and coffee and tea.

531
00:36:25,163 --> 00:36:27,745
[SPEAKER_06]: And I made a latte there for myself.

532
00:36:28,326 --> 00:36:31,429
[SPEAKER_06]: I freaking played bingo and had a latte with whipped cream.

533
00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:33,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they have a Starbucks in the casino.

534
00:36:33,331 --> 00:36:34,472
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what they have in the casino?

535
00:36:34,732 --> 00:36:35,353
[SPEAKER_09]: A fat burger.

536
00:36:36,113 --> 00:36:36,814
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't either.

537
00:36:37,234 --> 00:36:37,835
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, but it's...

538
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I did hear they have turkey burgers, so I'll have to go there for a turkey burger.

539
00:36:41,881 --> 00:36:43,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, I ate a pork cutlet.

540
00:36:44,582 --> 00:36:45,482
[SPEAKER_06]: It made me sick, too.

541
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:46,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you go to the buffet there?

542
00:36:47,263 --> 00:36:49,704
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I ate it at my friend's house.

543
00:36:50,064 --> 00:36:51,904
[SPEAKER_09]: We wanted to go to Fresh Choice.

544
00:36:52,205 --> 00:36:57,686
[SPEAKER_09]: When you come back from Alabama, we'll go play bingo, and we'll go late so we can go to the buffet, because the buffet is so good.

545
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:04,268
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing is, we played the 5-7 game, and the thing is that you don't get a second chance on the 5-7 game.

546
00:37:06,769 --> 00:37:09,750
[SPEAKER_06]: So we need to go play the earlier games if we're going to go.

547
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:10,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.

548
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,531
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can get a second chance to win because I was close.

549
00:37:14,352 --> 00:37:15,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it going 24 hours a day?

550
00:37:17,272 --> 00:37:17,853
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't think so.

551
00:37:17,973 --> 00:37:18,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well, shit.

552
00:37:19,353 --> 00:37:24,155
[SPEAKER_09]: The buffet is like... I know this is really interesting to all our listeners out of town, but just bear with us.

553
00:37:24,995 --> 00:37:29,916
[SPEAKER_09]: The buffet is only like $6 after 11 o'clock at night.

554
00:37:30,256 --> 00:37:30,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy crap.

555
00:37:30,877 --> 00:37:31,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we should go.

556
00:37:31,557 --> 00:37:32,337
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to go late.

557
00:37:32,637 --> 00:37:33,938
[SPEAKER_09]: But man, if you don't eat all day...

558
00:37:36,457 --> 00:37:38,959
[SPEAKER_06]: and then go... What's it like during the day?

559
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:40,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Pricey?

560
00:37:41,141 --> 00:37:41,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Like 15 bucks.

561
00:37:41,741 --> 00:37:43,042
[SPEAKER_06]: That's still not bad.

562
00:37:43,282 --> 00:37:45,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Not bad, but... Not for like a casino buffet.

563
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:47,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Considering everything you get, not bad.

564
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:54,871
[SPEAKER_06]: The one I went to at the... I want to say the Beaurevage, but that's one in Biloxi where my friend works.

565
00:37:55,552 --> 00:37:59,194
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was the Rio Casino.

566
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:01,436
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a seafood buffet.

567
00:38:01,476 --> 00:38:02,537
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like 30 bucks.

568
00:38:03,337 --> 00:38:03,958
[SPEAKER_06]: But you get like

569
00:38:04,954 --> 00:38:14,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Main Lobster on the buffet, you know, that was like king crab, Alaskan snow crab and everything.

570
00:38:14,999 --> 00:38:15,959
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, ha ha, fish.

571
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:17,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

572
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,341
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's, 15's not bad compared.

573
00:38:19,781 --> 00:38:20,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we'll have to go and eat back.

574
00:38:21,162 --> 00:38:22,142
[SPEAKER_09]: But have fun in Alabama.

575
00:38:22,343 --> 00:38:24,804
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what we're going to do on the show without you while you're gone.

576
00:38:25,644 --> 00:38:25,884
[SPEAKER_22]: Well.

577
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:30,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Because Loki and I, the last time we did a show by ourselves, it was very interesting.

578
00:38:30,306 --> 00:38:31,047
Yeah.

579
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that was the first time Loki made super bacon on the air.

580
00:38:34,621 --> 00:38:35,021
[SPEAKER_09]: God.

581
00:38:35,882 --> 00:38:38,923
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping we have a temporary fill-in somehow.

582
00:38:39,744 --> 00:38:40,364
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get somebody.

583
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,745
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to find my temporary fill-in.

584
00:38:42,765 --> 00:38:46,046
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to find a woman, because we need the female perspective on the show.

585
00:38:46,246 --> 00:38:46,827
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

586
00:38:46,847 --> 00:38:51,209
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to get... Yeah, we need to make Melody come down.

587
00:38:51,269 --> 00:38:52,229
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we'll figure something out.

588
00:38:52,349 --> 00:38:53,890
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to get Pixie, too.

589
00:38:56,463 --> 00:38:57,684
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't yet to meet her.

590
00:38:58,145 --> 00:38:59,666
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard good things about her, but I haven't met her.

591
00:38:59,906 --> 00:39:02,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Pixie Dust.

592
00:39:02,529 --> 00:39:04,191
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking of the other Pixie.

593
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:04,851
[SPEAKER_09]: There's two Pixies.

594
00:39:06,133 --> 00:39:08,375
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I'll have to, like, call.

595
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:10,019
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

596
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,281
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll just get all the women here in your absence.

597
00:39:12,341 --> 00:39:17,946
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get Irene and Melody and Janae and ViolentHyperGirl.

598
00:39:17,966 --> 00:39:19,468
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll just get them all here one night.

599
00:39:19,948 --> 00:39:22,770
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have a girls' night on Orange Lounge.

600
00:39:23,251 --> 00:39:23,911
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

601
00:39:26,974 --> 00:39:30,377
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll just be sitting in the corner making fun of everyone else.

602
00:39:34,281 --> 00:39:34,681
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

603
00:39:36,556 --> 00:39:36,956
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

604
00:39:38,557 --> 00:39:42,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, so who knows what's going to happen when you're gone, but we'll still be doing shows.

605
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:43,981
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to miss Episode 69.

606
00:39:44,581 --> 00:39:45,422
[SPEAKER_09]: I cry.

607
00:39:46,002 --> 00:39:46,643
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.

608
00:39:47,163 --> 00:39:50,125
[SPEAKER_09]: But some more announcements about what's coming up to the stations.

609
00:39:50,145 --> 00:39:51,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Some big changes coming in November.

610
00:39:51,746 --> 00:39:52,647
[SPEAKER_09]: All through the month, really.

611
00:39:53,687 --> 00:39:55,629
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll talk about that in a little while.

612
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:57,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God, my voice still isn't all the way back.

613
00:39:58,533 --> 00:40:03,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I was just about to go into... I can whine really well, but my voice is messed up.

614
00:40:03,836 --> 00:40:10,319
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just about to go into how was your week, how was your day, so I'll let you continue your bitching by asking you, how was your week, how was your day?

615
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:12,520
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have a voice most of the week.

616
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:16,681
[SPEAKER_06]: As everyone can tell, it's barely, barely back.

617
00:40:16,702 --> 00:40:16,722
[SPEAKER_06]: I...

618
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:23,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Felt lots better, you know, progressively throughout the day.

619
00:40:23,432 --> 00:40:25,993
[SPEAKER_06]: The cough is, I guess as everyone can tell, mostly cleared up.

620
00:40:26,433 --> 00:40:28,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I still need the codeine at night.

621
00:40:29,315 --> 00:40:30,355
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm on happy drugs.

622
00:40:30,456 --> 00:40:31,976
[SPEAKER_06]: I took the last of my antibiotics today.

623
00:40:32,397 --> 00:40:32,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Whee!

624
00:40:33,937 --> 00:40:38,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I didn't touch my Bimani except to lend it out to people while I'm out of town.

625
00:40:40,381 --> 00:40:42,562
[SPEAKER_09]: And... Shit, I should have gotten my ignition pad back.

626
00:40:42,762 --> 00:40:43,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh well.

627
00:40:43,643 --> 00:40:44,123
[SPEAKER_09]: That's alright.

628
00:40:44,223 --> 00:40:46,764
[SPEAKER_09]: He's gonna have the super ones done soon enough.

629
00:40:47,185 --> 00:40:47,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

630
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:53,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I haven't been able to play DDR while my asthma has been so bad.

631
00:40:53,448 --> 00:41:00,810
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm going to play it in Alabama, and I'm going to play it if they still have it, the Beatmania 6 Mix Machine, if they still have it in the middle of the mall.

632
00:41:02,071 --> 00:41:03,211
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking forward to that.

633
00:41:06,212 --> 00:41:08,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, I didn't do a lot, much of anything.

634
00:41:09,172 --> 00:41:10,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan and I went out a bunch.

635
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:14,334
[SPEAKER_06]: On Halloween, my work...

636
00:41:15,956 --> 00:41:18,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Every department decorated for a contest.

637
00:41:19,637 --> 00:41:29,020
[SPEAKER_06]: There's this one group that's in another building at the... I just told Bob where it is.

638
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:34,881
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's another building back there that they did Studio 100M.

639
00:41:36,002 --> 00:41:37,402
[SPEAKER_06]: So they made it up like a dance club.

640
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:42,425
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really nice, but one of the rooms upstairs was the super VIP room.

641
00:41:42,905 --> 00:41:49,168
[SPEAKER_06]: And they had baking powder out on a mirror with a laser blade to look like cocaine.

642
00:41:50,449 --> 00:41:50,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, how nice.

643
00:41:50,849 --> 00:41:53,170
[SPEAKER_06]: And everyone was dressed up all 70s and everything.

644
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:54,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's a lovely picture.

645
00:41:54,871 --> 00:41:59,333
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the other places was, they did it up like the Old West.

646
00:41:59,393 --> 00:42:00,693
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really nice the way they did it.

647
00:42:00,753 --> 00:42:02,974
[SPEAKER_06]: It had a bum in the jail and everything.

648
00:42:03,975 --> 00:42:06,236
[SPEAKER_06]: And another one was the Haunted Pirate Ship.

649
00:42:07,285 --> 00:42:08,186
[SPEAKER_06]: and one was the 60s.

650
00:42:08,286 --> 00:42:10,447
[SPEAKER_06]: They did the 60s theme.

651
00:42:10,767 --> 00:42:12,208
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what they handed out as snacks?

652
00:42:12,908 --> 00:42:13,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Brownies.

653
00:42:14,529 --> 00:42:16,090
[SPEAKER_06]: And this stuff called Bong Water.

654
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:17,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, how nice.

655
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:21,852
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a drink that these people are making in Arizona and they're going to be marketing it here now.

656
00:42:22,913 --> 00:42:24,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Like in the next few months or so.

657
00:42:25,394 --> 00:42:26,835
[SPEAKER_06]: And I tried it and it's really good.

658
00:42:27,315 --> 00:42:30,917
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, not really carbonated, but more like a flavored water beverage.

659
00:42:31,037 --> 00:42:31,517
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really good.

660
00:42:33,511 --> 00:42:36,074
[SPEAKER_06]: And now, customer service was the best.

661
00:42:36,214 --> 00:42:38,116
[SPEAKER_06]: We won best, of course.

662
00:42:38,277 --> 00:42:38,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you?

663
00:42:39,158 --> 00:42:41,340
[SPEAKER_06]: We were haven and heck.

664
00:42:42,381 --> 00:42:44,784
[SPEAKER_06]: And I decided that I was going to be in hell.

665
00:42:45,445 --> 00:42:47,767
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wore my evil boots.

666
00:42:48,688 --> 00:42:49,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Where you belong.

667
00:42:52,392 --> 00:42:59,939
[SPEAKER_06]: I wear my evil boots that I wore at Anime Expo from my Mad Hatter costume, the ones that make me, you know, instantly five inches taller.

668
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:06,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Black pinstripe pants, this, you know, black sort of corporate looking atop.

669
00:43:07,066 --> 00:43:15,534
[SPEAKER_06]: And my black wings, I had, you know, lots of really gothy makeup and carried my whip with me and I was a modern day angel of death.

670
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:25,737
[SPEAKER_06]: and all the cubicles were lined in black and the walls were black and red and we had a guillotine and we had the Grim Reaper hanging out in the corner.

671
00:43:26,257 --> 00:43:26,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Off with their heads.

672
00:43:27,197 --> 00:43:32,199
[SPEAKER_06]: We had these gates coming into the major walkways and they had fire raising from them.

673
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:34,380
[SPEAKER_06]: We had little torches, fake fire everywhere.

674
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,920
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had the lights off.

675
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:37,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Fire's great.

676
00:43:38,061 --> 00:43:40,461
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was all red and fiery and everything.

677
00:43:40,481 --> 00:43:44,543
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally missed Halloween in my work, but I'll get into that later.

678
00:43:44,963 --> 00:43:45,363
[SPEAKER_06]: But, uh,

679
00:43:46,588 --> 00:43:49,714
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the girls at my work, her costume was the best.

680
00:43:49,734 --> 00:43:53,280
[SPEAKER_06]: She did the girl from The Ring, the TV girl.

681
00:43:53,641 --> 00:43:54,362
[SPEAKER_22]: Cool.

682
00:43:55,404 --> 00:43:57,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep in mind, I haven't seen The Ring, but I knew...

683
00:43:58,467 --> 00:44:07,032
[SPEAKER_09]: The Ring is, for a contemporary horror movie, it's really, really good.

684
00:44:07,112 --> 00:44:08,453
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to watch Ringu.

685
00:44:08,713 --> 00:44:14,936
[SPEAKER_09]: I have actually heard that some people, even folks that usually prefer Japanese cinema, actually say The Ring is better.

686
00:44:15,076 --> 00:44:15,817
[SPEAKER_09]: But I've heard mixed.

687
00:44:15,917 --> 00:44:20,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I've heard that the Japanese one's more suspense and the American one's more horror.

688
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I could see that.

689
00:44:22,921 --> 00:44:25,022
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would go for the suspense over the other two.

690
00:44:26,224 --> 00:44:28,145
[SPEAKER_06]: and I watched movie trailers today.

691
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:28,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you?

692
00:44:29,265 --> 00:44:30,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Preview for a movie I have to see.

693
00:44:31,046 --> 00:44:31,406
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that?

694
00:44:31,647 --> 00:44:32,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Alien vs. Predator.

695
00:44:34,048 --> 00:44:34,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, crap.

696
00:44:34,608 --> 00:44:36,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, give me a break.

697
00:44:36,029 --> 00:44:37,449
[SPEAKER_09]: That looks like crap.

698
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:39,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?

699
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:39,310
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

700
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:42,632
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to see it because I've read some of the comics.

701
00:44:42,932 --> 00:44:45,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Alien vs. Predator needs to stay a video game.

702
00:44:46,579 --> 00:44:49,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I know it's nothing like the comics, but... I have a question.

703
00:44:49,845 --> 00:44:56,338
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a question that will determine if this... I have a question of all question that will determine if this movie will suck or not.

704
00:44:56,779 --> 00:44:57,821
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Sigourney Weaver in it.

705
00:44:58,889 --> 00:44:59,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck this movie.

706
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:01,450
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm still going to see it.

707
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:06,112
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still going to see it just because I want to see all the action that ensues.

708
00:45:06,172 --> 00:45:07,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care about the story.

709
00:45:07,633 --> 00:45:10,634
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm there to see predators and aliens beating each other up.

710
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,916
[SPEAKER_09]: This movie ruins the continuity of all the sequels.

711
00:45:14,456 --> 00:45:16,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, it makes no sense.

712
00:45:16,517 --> 00:45:18,258
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it's supposed to.

713
00:45:18,598 --> 00:45:19,498
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes no sense.

714
00:45:19,618 --> 00:45:20,539
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just retarded.

715
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:24,561
[SPEAKER_09]: I would rather see Freddy vs. Jason ten more times.

716
00:45:25,161 --> 00:45:26,762
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd watch the featurette on it.

717
00:45:26,982 --> 00:45:27,482
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd rather...

718
00:45:28,405 --> 00:45:31,647
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd rather go see The House of the Dead than this movie.

719
00:45:32,307 --> 00:45:35,609
[SPEAKER_06]: The story is utter shit, but I think the action's going to be good.

720
00:45:36,629 --> 00:45:42,112
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to see the decapitations and shootings and blood and crap.

721
00:45:42,792 --> 00:45:44,993
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see all... I'm going... I want to see it for the action.

722
00:45:45,013 --> 00:45:45,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, fair enough.

723
00:45:45,954 --> 00:45:47,094
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're in it for the violence.

724
00:45:47,174 --> 00:45:48,075
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in it for the violence.

725
00:45:48,235 --> 00:45:48,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, fair enough.

726
00:45:48,795 --> 00:45:50,556
[SPEAKER_06]: That for me is going to be a gore bust.

727
00:45:50,576 --> 00:45:53,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Cheesy gore, I can deal with that as a reason.

728
00:45:53,437 --> 00:45:56,739
[SPEAKER_09]: However, let's see Alien vs. Predator vs. Ash.

729
00:45:57,426 --> 00:45:58,126
[SPEAKER_09]: How about it, huh?

730
00:45:58,286 --> 00:45:58,687
[SPEAKER_09]: How about it?

731
00:45:59,147 --> 00:46:00,508
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just bring out the boomstick.

732
00:46:03,129 --> 00:46:04,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Question from chat room, Jamie.

733
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:05,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Is the feature ad on the web somewhere?

734
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:17,617
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go to apple.com slash trailers, it's actually in, I think there's four columns and it's in the second one.

735
00:46:19,217 --> 00:46:19,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool.

736
00:46:20,118 --> 00:46:21,419
[SPEAKER_09]: So what other movie trailers did you watch?

737
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:23,320
[SPEAKER_06]: I watched one for Resident Evil Apocalypse.

738
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:24,120
[SPEAKER_06]: That was funny.

739
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the sequel?

740
00:46:25,621 --> 00:46:25,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

741
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:29,903
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a commercial for this stuff called Regenerate.

742
00:46:31,224 --> 00:46:37,270
[SPEAKER_06]: And this woman, and you can tell it's obviously touched up, a young woman, but she's got it looking all wrinkled and everything.

743
00:46:37,871 --> 00:46:43,016
[SPEAKER_06]: And it looks like, for the people who saw Resident Evil, it looks like the T-Virus.

744
00:46:44,298 --> 00:46:44,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

745
00:47:02,191 --> 00:47:03,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I'll check out the sequel when it's on video.

746
00:47:04,432 --> 00:47:07,612
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to watch the trailer, though, because it is hilarious.

747
00:47:08,133 --> 00:47:16,715
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, the best movie, you know, game movie adaptions have to be, without a doubt, Street Fighter Double Dragon.

748
00:47:16,775 --> 00:47:19,816
[SPEAKER_09]: They rocked like nothing else.

749
00:47:20,656 --> 00:47:23,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up, shut up, shut up.

750
00:47:23,577 --> 00:47:25,177
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I thought you were going to say Super Mario Brothers.

751
00:47:25,737 --> 00:47:27,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Has there been a really, really good one?

752
00:47:28,538 --> 00:47:28,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Well...

753
00:47:29,682 --> 00:47:30,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Mortal Kombat was decent.

754
00:47:30,943 --> 00:47:31,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Mortal Kombat was good.

755
00:47:31,943 --> 00:47:32,824
[SPEAKER_09]: When I was at that age.

756
00:47:36,226 --> 00:47:41,829
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I thought was better than... Actually, it's another Van Damme movie that I thought was better than the Street Fighter movie that they did.

757
00:47:42,249 --> 00:47:43,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it seemed like it fit more in it.

758
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:44,470
[SPEAKER_06]: What was it called?

759
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:45,031
[SPEAKER_06]: The Quest?

760
00:47:46,692 --> 00:47:48,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there was a Van Damme movie called The Quest.

761
00:47:48,693 --> 00:47:50,654
[SPEAKER_06]: That made me think of a Street Fighter flick.

762
00:47:51,845 --> 00:47:52,826
[SPEAKER_06]: What Street Fighter should have been.

763
00:47:52,866 --> 00:47:54,187
[SPEAKER_06]: I had that whole impression when I saw it.

764
00:47:54,427 --> 00:47:56,709
[SPEAKER_06]: And I went and saw that one in the theater because it was a dollar movie.

765
00:47:57,430 --> 00:48:02,254
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole reason I was there is because I went there to play one of my favorite games ever, Starblade.

766
00:48:02,934 --> 00:48:09,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they had the one with the big crane set up where you played 75 cents and you were in this full 3D motion.

767
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:10,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

768
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:14,964
[SPEAKER_06]: And they told me that I had to see a movie to keep playing the game, so I went and saw that.

769
00:48:16,465 --> 00:48:19,868
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I went to... Because I was like the only person who could...

770
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:23,231
[SPEAKER_08]: The Last Starfighter.

771
00:48:25,433 --> 00:48:26,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't that the game?

772
00:48:26,554 --> 00:48:29,376
[SPEAKER_08]: The game came out after the movie.

773
00:48:29,396 --> 00:48:29,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever!

774
00:48:30,397 --> 00:48:31,939
[SPEAKER_09]: It still ties together.

775
00:48:32,699 --> 00:48:33,880
[SPEAKER_06]: The Last Starfighter was a good movie.

776
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:34,321
[SPEAKER_09]: You lose.

777
00:48:34,501 --> 00:48:35,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Try again.

778
00:48:35,962 --> 00:48:37,483
[SPEAKER_06]: But I know I remember it was a good one.

779
00:48:38,645 --> 00:48:39,966
[SPEAKER_06]: I just can't think of what it was.

780
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:45,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's ask our chatroom.

781
00:48:45,611 --> 00:48:45,831
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

782
00:48:46,972 --> 00:48:47,612
[SPEAKER_06]: What do they think?

783
00:48:47,652 --> 00:48:49,234
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we need to do a list list tonight.

784
00:48:50,487 --> 00:48:52,527
[SPEAKER_06]: What game needs to be made into a movie?

785
00:48:54,268 --> 00:48:54,888
[SPEAKER_09]: We can do it.

786
00:48:54,968 --> 00:48:55,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Just three of us?

787
00:48:55,888 --> 00:48:56,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, why not?

788
00:48:57,528 --> 00:48:59,049
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll put four things on instead of three.

789
00:48:59,489 --> 00:48:59,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

790
00:48:59,849 --> 00:49:00,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Fair enough?

791
00:49:00,469 --> 00:49:02,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

792
00:49:02,829 --> 00:49:04,269
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'm cool with that.

793
00:49:04,289 --> 00:49:05,150
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't done that ever?

794
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:06,130
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

795
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:07,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, okay, we'll do that.

796
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:08,910
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought we had two.

797
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:17,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'll ask an Orange Lounge historian such as Dark Tetsuya or Angel that follows the show better than we do if we've done that before.

798
00:49:17,772 --> 00:49:18,552
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we have.

799
00:49:19,662 --> 00:49:20,763
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that we've done that one.

800
00:49:22,264 --> 00:49:27,249
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we've joked a lot about DDR the movie on this show, but I don't think we ever did that one.

801
00:49:27,269 --> 00:49:28,249
[SPEAKER_06]: What a big hoax.

802
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:32,233
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I laugh to this day about the people who thought it was going to happen.

803
00:49:34,155 --> 00:49:39,739
[SPEAKER_09]: I still think, especially after seeing the Parapara manga, which I think came up on Vanilla Sky.

804
00:49:39,759 --> 00:49:42,382
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it came up on this show because we didn't find it until Monday.

805
00:49:43,357 --> 00:49:48,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, the Power of Power manga was the exact same story they were going to use for the DDR movie.

806
00:49:48,683 --> 00:49:56,492
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I'm thinking that people bought the story for the DDR movie and go, well, let's just put it with another Romani game.

807
00:49:56,512 --> 00:49:57,873
[SPEAKER_08]: They're never going to know the difference.

808
00:50:03,019 --> 00:50:04,300
[SPEAKER_09]: So, back to your week and your day.

809
00:50:05,424 --> 00:50:08,385
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still waiting for Battle Royale Volume 3 to be out.

810
00:50:09,245 --> 00:50:13,066
[SPEAKER_06]: And I haven't had a chance to go by Kino Kuniya to pick up the others that I'm missing.

811
00:50:15,426 --> 00:50:20,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Apart from that, I decided that I'm going to start picking up another manga series after I'm done with Battle Royale.

812
00:50:21,208 --> 00:50:24,629
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's Berserk, which is still going and very expensive, but I don't care.

813
00:50:25,289 --> 00:50:26,129
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's really about it.

814
00:50:27,489 --> 00:50:28,670
[SPEAKER_06]: I spent lots of time with my boy.

815
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:31,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, we haven't heard much from you this show.

816
00:50:32,011 --> 00:50:33,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, chat room, no flooding.

817
00:50:35,208 --> 00:50:37,649
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, you're getting kicked.

818
00:50:38,009 --> 00:50:38,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Every last one of you.

819
00:50:40,509 --> 00:50:42,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, we haven't heard much from you yet this show.

820
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:42,430
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up?

821
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:45,471
[SPEAKER_09]: I've eaten too much rice.

822
00:50:46,431 --> 00:50:47,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Had two bowls of rice.

823
00:50:47,631 --> 00:50:48,952
[SPEAKER_08]: I should have known better than that.

824
00:50:49,732 --> 00:50:52,633
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um... I didn't do anything this week.

825
00:50:54,253 --> 00:50:56,854
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um... Just kinda hung out.

826
00:50:57,514 --> 00:50:58,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Got a costume for Halloween.

827
00:50:59,054 --> 00:51:00,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Wore the costume for Halloween.

828
00:51:01,715 --> 00:51:02,495
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um...

829
00:51:04,736 --> 00:51:08,459
[SPEAKER_08]: I was working on my pads, or not my pads, my cabinet.

830
00:51:08,739 --> 00:51:09,379
[SPEAKER_08]: I was working on it.

831
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:13,222
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to finish it, or well, not really finish it, but start actually putting it together today.

832
00:51:14,924 --> 00:51:20,808
[SPEAKER_08]: But then I realized my measurements were off because the plans called for 5 eighths of an inch.

833
00:51:22,429 --> 00:51:23,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

834
00:51:41,377 --> 00:51:43,718
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, not too much other stuff has been going on.

835
00:51:43,758 --> 00:51:49,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Just been sitting at home and stuff inside because it's cold out.

836
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,981
[SPEAKER_08]: And went down to the golf lane yesterday and that was okay.

837
00:51:54,642 --> 00:51:55,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Stupid people there.

838
00:51:58,343 --> 00:51:59,823
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, not much.

839
00:52:00,024 --> 00:52:03,905
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd think I'd be playing Castlevania since I bought it, but no I'm not because I don't care.

840
00:52:04,845 --> 00:52:09,547
[SPEAKER_08]: And thought about playing Zelda today but never actually got to play Zelda today.

841
00:52:12,009 --> 00:52:15,134
[SPEAKER_08]: and... I don't know.

842
00:52:15,555 --> 00:52:17,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Just broke, waiting for more money.

843
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,161
[SPEAKER_08]: That's about it.

844
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:30,964
[SPEAKER_09]: My week was interesting because I was on vacation this week, and originally my plan was to go to West Hollywood for Halloween, because, you know, I want to be with my people on Halloween.

845
00:52:32,085 --> 00:52:33,825
[SPEAKER_09]: But it didn't end up happening.

846
00:52:33,845 --> 00:52:37,027
[SPEAKER_09]: We decided to cancel the trip, mostly because of the fires that were going on in SoCal.

847
00:52:37,047 --> 00:52:38,988
[SPEAKER_09]: We kind of didn't want to end up in the middle of all of it.

848
00:52:39,048 --> 00:52:45,411
[SPEAKER_09]: My friend has really bad asthma and was afraid that the ash in the air might get to him, contacts as well, things like that.

849
00:52:46,251 --> 00:52:48,212
[SPEAKER_09]: and just some other stuff that came up.

850
00:52:48,232 --> 00:52:49,432
[SPEAKER_09]: So we ended up going on the trip.

851
00:52:49,492 --> 00:52:53,134
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've kind of just been having a lazy vacation.

852
00:52:53,174 --> 00:52:54,654
[SPEAKER_09]: I've just been sitting on my big butt.

853
00:52:55,394 --> 00:52:58,836
[SPEAKER_09]: I literally think I've gained three pounds while on this vacation.

854
00:52:59,016 --> 00:53:02,857
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't care because I've kind of...

855
00:53:04,157 --> 00:53:05,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Just needed it, I think.

856
00:53:05,338 --> 00:53:07,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I've been working really hard non-stop for the past couple months.

857
00:53:07,998 --> 00:53:08,999
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's going to be crazy.

858
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:11,839
[SPEAKER_09]: This holiday season right up until Christmas is going to be really crazy.

859
00:53:11,879 --> 00:53:13,260
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just not going to have any time for anything.

860
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:17,821
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm kind of glad I got a little vacation before I have to go back.

861
00:53:17,881 --> 00:53:20,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes a vacation can be taken in your living room.

862
00:53:21,502 --> 00:53:23,562
[SPEAKER_09]: And I played a lot of Final Fantasy XI.

863
00:53:24,022 --> 00:53:25,923
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll talk about Final Fantasy XI a little later in the show.

864
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:28,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Much to Jamie's dislike.

865
00:53:28,744 --> 00:53:30,004
[SPEAKER_09]: But she'll just have to deal with it.

866
00:53:30,984 --> 00:53:43,788
[SPEAKER_06]: That was pretty much my week and my day.

867
00:53:44,428 --> 00:53:46,629
[SPEAKER_09]: Today, not a whole lot going on.

868
00:53:46,669 --> 00:53:47,870
[SPEAKER_09]: I've just been sleeping in.

869
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:58,233
[SPEAKER_09]: I tried to get myself back on a regular sleep schedule because I've got to get up early and go back to work tomorrow, so I don't want to be on too crazy of a sleep schedule because I don't want to be an irritable bitch tomorrow.

870
00:53:59,813 --> 00:54:00,574
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty much it.

871
00:54:01,134 --> 00:54:04,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, at least you're not going in for the 5.30 shift.

872
00:54:05,097 --> 00:54:10,000
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but I am going in a half hour early tomorrow, which means we're going in at 7, which for me is early, so we'll see.

873
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,521
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we work the same shift.

874
00:54:12,561 --> 00:54:14,823
[SPEAKER_09]: I work 7.30 to 4 usually.

875
00:54:14,843 --> 00:54:15,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, 7.30 to 4.30.

876
00:54:15,203 --> 00:54:17,285
[SPEAKER_09]: We're about the same.

877
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:18,545
[SPEAKER_09]: I only take a half for lunch.

878
00:54:19,406 --> 00:54:21,647
[SPEAKER_06]: I have something to tell you later, though.

879
00:54:22,368 --> 00:54:22,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

880
00:54:22,608 --> 00:54:23,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Which might be interesting.

881
00:54:23,649 --> 00:54:24,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, really?

882
00:54:24,549 --> 00:54:24,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

883
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:26,631
[SPEAKER_06]: My work is moving in a few months.

884
00:54:27,611 --> 00:54:28,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, to near me?

885
00:54:28,971 --> 00:54:30,352
[SPEAKER_06]: to the area I used to work in.

886
00:54:30,812 --> 00:54:31,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

887
00:54:32,292 --> 00:54:32,872
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

888
00:54:33,393 --> 00:54:33,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool deal.

889
00:54:35,693 --> 00:54:36,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

890
00:54:36,694 --> 00:54:41,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think what we're going to do this break is we're going to take another break, actually, right now, and then we're going to come back.

891
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:44,497
[SPEAKER_09]: And we actually have some Bambani things to talk about, so we'll do that.

892
00:54:44,957 --> 00:54:49,118
[SPEAKER_09]: We have the cage match still, the FUs of the week, of course, all that fun stuff.

893
00:54:49,318 --> 00:54:51,199
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you want to hear next?

894
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:58,924
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we're going to, since we did an attack break last time, I think what we're going to do this time is we'll take a Taka break.

895
00:55:00,044 --> 00:55:00,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Won't that be fun?

896
00:55:01,725 --> 00:55:02,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

897
00:55:03,206 --> 00:55:07,949
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll be back, and some Bomani news to talk about, among other things.

898
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:15,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Join our chat room, www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on Chat.

899
00:55:16,615 --> 00:55:18,776
[SPEAKER_09]: And while I look for the MP3 I want this break...

900
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:24,483
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that later on during the show, though, we need to do a break of another's.

901
00:55:26,044 --> 00:55:26,605
[SPEAKER_09]: We could do that.

902
00:55:27,606 --> 00:55:32,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, I'm really, really, really, sometime today, wanting to hear a leading side for another.

903
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:34,491
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see if we can arrange that.

904
00:55:35,292 --> 00:55:37,914
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we're going to take a break with some talk of music, and we will be back.

905
00:57:04,468 --> 00:57:04,753
Thank you.

906
00:58:16,169 --> 00:58:17,226
Thanks for watching!

907
01:01:36,005 --> 01:01:37,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio.

908
01:01:37,586 --> 01:01:39,747
[SPEAKER_09]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

909
01:01:40,567 --> 01:01:40,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Howdy.

910
01:01:40,927 --> 01:01:41,227
[SPEAKER_09]: We're back.

911
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:41,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you miss us?

912
01:01:52,819 --> 01:01:54,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 67.

913
01:01:54,742 --> 01:01:55,843
[SPEAKER_09]: We're in the middle of it right now.

914
01:01:55,863 --> 01:01:59,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and it's gooey and sticky.

915
01:01:59,588 --> 01:02:00,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Big station news.

916
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:02,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Big, big station news.

917
01:02:02,572 --> 01:02:06,056
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of shit coming to the station in November.

918
01:02:08,359 --> 01:02:10,482
[SPEAKER_09]: First off, this Wednesday...

919
01:02:11,298 --> 01:02:16,141
[SPEAKER_09]: is the return of LiveWire, so you better be listening, because we don't want Loki to have another fit.

920
01:02:17,242 --> 01:02:20,204
[SPEAKER_09]: But no, if you're not listening, you're seriously missing out, because it's some good stuff.

921
01:02:20,284 --> 01:02:22,105
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're not listening, you're a poopy head.

922
01:02:22,125 --> 01:02:31,952
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right, you're missing out on live mixing of Dance Trance and sometimes, sometimes, once in a while, a Bomani song.

923
01:02:32,512 --> 01:02:33,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anything you want to say about Loki?

924
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:36,335
[SPEAKER_09]: He's too busy thumbing through my Final Fantasy XI manual.

925
01:02:36,455 --> 01:02:36,995
[SPEAKER_09]: No, he says no.

926
01:02:37,856 --> 01:02:39,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, you're being awfully quiet tonight.

927
01:02:39,377 --> 01:02:39,977
[SPEAKER_09]: Is everything okay?

928
01:02:40,117 --> 01:02:40,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you feeling alright?

929
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:43,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Aw, he has a headache.

930
01:02:43,181 --> 01:02:45,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want some Advil?

931
01:02:46,882 --> 01:02:50,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's outside.

932
01:02:50,904 --> 01:02:52,405
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have Live Wire returning on Wednesday.

933
01:02:53,045 --> 01:02:58,348
[SPEAKER_09]: This week, by the way, this week and one week only, Vanilla Sky and Pump Up the Volume are changing nights.

934
01:02:58,808 --> 01:03:02,090
[SPEAKER_09]: So Pump Up the Volume will be on Monday, Vanilla Sky will be on Tuesday.

935
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:02,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Just so you know.

936
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:06,031
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm probably going to be away from the computer quite a bit.

937
01:03:06,051 --> 01:03:06,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't tell them that.

938
01:03:07,091 --> 01:03:07,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no.

939
01:03:07,531 --> 01:03:10,132
[SPEAKER_09]: But that has to do with Jamie's trip because she's leaving on Tuesday.

940
01:03:10,152 --> 01:03:11,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because actually I packed today.

941
01:03:12,472 --> 01:03:13,192
[SPEAKER_06]: My clothes are packed today.

942
01:03:13,212 --> 01:03:13,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay, cool.

943
01:03:13,753 --> 01:03:15,533
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have my other little things to pack.

944
01:03:15,613 --> 01:03:20,514
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm hoping that people actually make requests this time around.

945
01:03:21,274 --> 01:03:25,996
[SPEAKER_06]: And lots of people listen, make it a good show for me because I won't be able to do it for two weeks.

946
01:03:26,096 --> 01:03:27,616
[SPEAKER_06]: But you get to hear old shows.

947
01:03:28,816 --> 01:03:29,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

948
01:03:30,277 --> 01:03:31,697
[SPEAKER_06]: But apart from that, you know.

949
01:03:32,313 --> 01:03:35,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen, request.

950
01:03:35,694 --> 01:03:37,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Also coming to the station in November.

951
01:03:40,455 --> 01:03:42,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Something that you guys have been asking me about for a long time.

952
01:03:43,196 --> 01:03:45,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Sunday, November 23rd.

953
01:03:45,536 --> 01:03:46,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Mark your calendars.

954
01:03:46,476 --> 01:03:52,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Sunday, November 23rd is season four of Orange Lounge Radio, the debut.

955
01:03:52,098 --> 01:03:54,358
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's going to be Jamie's return because she'll be back from Alabama.

956
01:03:55,078 --> 01:03:55,899
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's episode number 70.

957
01:03:55,939 --> 01:03:55,999
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

958
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:01,402
[SPEAKER_09]: That is when the station is going to go to MP3 Pro.

959
01:04:02,903 --> 01:04:13,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Depending on Live 365's setup, we may or may not be able to have the live shows in MP3 Pro, but our Bomani Music Amore program will be in MP3 Pro.

960
01:04:13,091 --> 01:04:23,499
[SPEAKER_09]: For those that don't know what MP3 Pro is, we'll have details on our website at that point about how you can get DSL quality sound over your modem connection with MP3 Pro.

961
01:04:23,519 --> 01:04:24,119
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very cool.

962
01:04:26,883 --> 01:04:28,144
[SPEAKER_06]: What about cable quality?

963
01:04:29,145 --> 01:04:35,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, cable, ISD, better quality, because life uses five plugs in its DSL quality.

964
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:36,191
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm teasing.

965
01:04:36,231 --> 01:04:37,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Way better quality.

966
01:04:37,252 --> 01:04:37,692
[SPEAKER_09]: How about this?

967
01:04:38,052 --> 01:04:39,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Broadband quality.

968
01:04:39,253 --> 01:04:40,254
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

969
01:04:40,635 --> 01:04:42,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Broadband quality radio over your modem.

970
01:04:42,736 --> 01:04:43,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Power.

971
01:04:43,237 --> 01:04:43,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

972
01:04:44,858 --> 01:04:45,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I had the ferret in the air.

973
01:04:46,039 --> 01:04:51,604
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, just before Jamie gets back from break, we will be setting the ferrets on fire live.

974
01:04:51,664 --> 01:04:52,304
[SPEAKER_09]: No!

975
01:04:53,565 --> 01:04:55,047
[SPEAKER_06]: I will hide the ferrets.

976
01:04:56,463 --> 01:04:57,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, babies.

977
01:04:59,308 --> 01:05:01,772
[SPEAKER_06]: The ferrets love me, you hear?

978
01:05:02,052 --> 01:05:03,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, don't kill the babies.

979
01:05:04,396 --> 01:05:05,778
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't murder them!

980
01:05:05,798 --> 01:05:08,222
[SPEAKER_09]: You're gonna have to take them to Alabama with you if you don't want them to die.

981
01:05:10,563 --> 01:05:11,724
[SPEAKER_09]: You were anti-ferret.

982
01:05:12,725 --> 01:05:16,449
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's all the news for now coming up to the station soon.

983
01:05:16,649 --> 01:05:17,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you're right.

984
01:05:17,109 --> 01:05:17,730
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm anti-ferret.

985
01:05:20,813 --> 01:05:21,754
[SPEAKER_09]: There is one other thing.

986
01:05:22,454 --> 01:05:31,623
[SPEAKER_09]: I was hoping tonight we would have new Poppin' Music 10 MP3s to debut for you because we've gotten the connection to get the music for it.

987
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:35,664
[SPEAKER_09]: There is some great stuff on the Papa Music 10 soundtrack.

988
01:05:35,804 --> 01:05:40,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, I know a lot of people have always been kind of, eh, Papa Music stuff's kind of cheesy, things like that.

989
01:05:40,348 --> 01:05:42,910
[SPEAKER_09]: But seriously, there's some good shit on Papa Music 10.

990
01:05:44,211 --> 01:05:45,533
[SPEAKER_09]: And you guys have to hear it.

991
01:05:46,553 --> 01:05:50,357
[SPEAKER_09]: For instance, Tack doing a duet with Desro.

992
01:05:51,295 --> 01:05:51,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

993
01:05:51,936 --> 01:05:52,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting.

994
01:05:52,956 --> 01:05:54,377
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds a lot like Distress.

995
01:05:55,518 --> 01:06:02,543
[SPEAKER_09]: That would just make me so... Taco with a new trance song, and he got together with somebody, and I can't fucking remember who it was.

996
01:06:02,603 --> 01:06:03,163
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize.

997
01:06:03,183 --> 01:06:05,425
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll have to see when I get the soundtrack.

998
01:06:06,145 --> 01:06:08,006
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, this is the greatest one of all.

999
01:06:08,807 --> 01:06:12,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. T doing Goonies Are Good Enough.

1000
01:06:12,429 --> 01:06:12,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool!

1001
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:16,592
[SPEAKER_09]: It is the coolest thing I've ever heard in a Bomondi game in my life.

1002
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:17,673
[SPEAKER_09]: I cannot wait.

1003
01:06:18,373 --> 01:06:18,974
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um...

1004
01:06:20,805 --> 01:06:21,305
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't wait.

1005
01:06:21,825 --> 01:06:23,446
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be great.

1006
01:06:23,466 --> 01:06:25,327
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still looking forward to TAC.

1007
01:06:26,707 --> 01:06:33,770
[SPEAKER_09]: What I'm thinking is maybe Thursday or so we'll have a Poppin' Music 10 debut special.

1008
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:35,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Something will be pre-taped.

1009
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:36,010
[SPEAKER_09]: It won't be a live thing.

1010
01:06:36,351 --> 01:06:38,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Just some music so you guys can hear it.

1011
01:06:40,492 --> 01:06:41,292
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be awesome.

1012
01:06:42,393 --> 01:06:46,114
[SPEAKER_06]: I still remember being all happy about hearing the Yamato theme.

1013
01:06:47,199 --> 01:06:48,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the Yamato theme from Pop Music.

1014
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:50,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we'll play some Pop Music MP3s later.

1015
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:53,682
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Lem song.

1016
01:06:54,682 --> 01:06:55,042
[SPEAKER_09]: What song?

1017
01:06:55,362 --> 01:06:56,443
[SPEAKER_06]: The Lem theme song.

1018
01:06:56,503 --> 01:07:00,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

1019
01:07:03,045 --> 01:07:04,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Urusei Yatsura, that was what it was.

1020
01:07:08,837 --> 01:07:10,998
[SPEAKER_09]: So hopefully we'll have those pop music 10 MP3s for you soon.

1021
01:07:12,699 --> 01:07:18,402
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also Guitar Freaks new music that's out too, but I don't know if there's anything on that worth playing right now.

1022
01:07:18,462 --> 01:07:20,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we'll get to it later in the show.

1023
01:07:20,262 --> 01:07:20,603
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

1024
01:07:21,643 --> 01:07:24,985
[SPEAKER_06]: I still think there should be more home versions of the Guitar Freaks games.

1025
01:07:25,885 --> 01:07:26,505
[SPEAKER_09]: I do too.

1026
01:07:26,966 --> 01:07:32,268
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a freaking drum manual controller and two Guitar Freaks controllers and no session.

1027
01:07:33,068 --> 01:07:34,069
[SPEAKER_06]: No new sessions for me.

1028
01:07:36,497 --> 01:07:39,198
[SPEAKER_06]: And they need to figure out how to get Keyboard Mania to work with it, too.

1029
01:07:39,978 --> 01:07:40,338
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree.

1030
01:07:42,578 --> 01:07:45,719
[SPEAKER_06]: My poor, dust-collected Keyboard Mania.

1031
01:07:47,319 --> 01:07:48,680
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't played Keyboard Mania.

1032
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,900
[SPEAKER_09]: I never even did bother to buy second and third.

1033
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:53,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I like second and third better than the first one.

1034
01:07:54,401 --> 01:07:55,081
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's nice?

1035
01:07:55,121 --> 01:07:56,401
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the player in the second and third.

1036
01:07:56,481 --> 01:08:03,263
[SPEAKER_09]: What's nice is I'll finally be able to dust off my 2DX controller because they have the signatures they needed or whatever to get the...

1037
01:08:04,861 --> 01:08:07,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Get the new consumer style made.

1038
01:08:08,964 --> 01:08:16,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hoping that if I have the money available, I might just do the new arcade style controller release.

1039
01:08:17,009 --> 01:08:17,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yes.

1040
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:21,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Just breaking down and ordering mine through Himeya.

1041
01:08:23,193 --> 01:08:30,477
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping that in the new 2DX consumer style, that they have every Konami original from 7th to 8th and 9th style.

1042
01:08:30,517 --> 01:08:31,438
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be so beautiful.

1043
01:08:31,718 --> 01:08:32,199
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd cry.

1044
01:08:33,459 --> 01:08:34,320
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be pretty cool.

1045
01:08:34,824 --> 01:08:40,929
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, now that we've seen DDR Extreme, we know that Konami is willing to put 100 plus songs in a home mix.

1046
01:08:41,069 --> 01:08:46,374
[SPEAKER_09]: So, there's no reason why they can't do DDR with us.

1047
01:08:46,474 --> 01:08:49,016
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they need to put Tack in a box and ship him to my house.

1048
01:08:51,778 --> 01:08:53,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Make him mix for me all day at gunpoint.

1049
01:08:54,801 --> 01:08:58,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's see some other news going on right now in the Bomani world.

1050
01:08:59,242 --> 01:09:01,223
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to read this for you guys.

1051
01:09:01,443 --> 01:09:02,703
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got to pull up the story, though.

1052
01:09:03,744 --> 01:09:04,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, fill time.

1053
01:09:06,004 --> 01:09:13,107
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what?

1054
01:09:13,507 --> 01:09:13,707
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1055
01:09:13,947 --> 01:09:15,687
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sitting on the floor, and I don't know why.

1056
01:09:16,288 --> 01:09:17,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are you sitting on the floor tonight?

1057
01:09:18,644 --> 01:09:23,511
[SPEAKER_06]: It's comfy and it's not in front of the camera.

1058
01:09:24,112 --> 01:09:25,453
[SPEAKER_06]: I can hide here effectively.

1059
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:29,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Not many places I can hide effectively from the webcam.

1060
01:09:30,841 --> 01:09:32,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, yeah, there are plenty of places.

1061
01:09:32,631 --> 01:09:34,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, here's what I wanted to get into.

1062
01:09:34,692 --> 01:09:42,495
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the song list is released for DDR Xbox, DDR Ultramix, as a lot of us have been calling it, DDR Xbox.

1063
01:09:42,535 --> 01:09:48,838
[SPEAKER_09]: The full song list is out, and so I thought we'd go over it and get your guys' reactions to the songs that are on it.

1064
01:09:49,098 --> 01:09:49,639
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys think?

1065
01:09:49,959 --> 01:09:50,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, you with us?

1066
01:09:51,379 --> 01:09:51,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, cool.

1067
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:52,620
[SPEAKER_09]: .59 by DJ Taka.

1068
01:09:55,948 --> 01:10:02,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolute, the Cuff and Stuff It Mix by Thuggy D, which would pretty much be Scotty D. That's stupid.

1069
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:03,410
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1070
01:10:03,730 --> 01:10:05,271
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds kind of stupid, the name.

1071
01:10:05,691 --> 01:10:12,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the Cuff and Stuff It Mix sounds a little... I'm worried because I'm wondering if it's going to be like a rap version of Absolute, you know?

1072
01:10:12,373 --> 01:10:15,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that would suck.

1073
01:10:16,314 --> 01:10:18,935
[SPEAKER_06]: That would suck more than anything has sucked before.

1074
01:10:19,815 --> 01:10:21,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Except for Let Them Move.

1075
01:10:21,776 --> 01:10:23,276
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to just have high hopes.

1076
01:10:28,194 --> 01:10:28,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, we're still here.

1077
01:10:33,116 --> 01:10:36,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Also on DDR Ultramix, After the Game of Love.

1078
01:10:36,497 --> 01:10:42,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Notice it's not After the Game, but because Xbox will be a little more scandalous, they're going with After the Game of Love.

1079
01:10:42,959 --> 01:10:43,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy.

1080
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:44,900
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's gone out.

1081
01:10:45,756 --> 01:10:51,638
[SPEAKER_09]: A new transplant song from 2DX, Ballad For You, is going to be an Ultramix.

1082
01:10:51,898 --> 01:10:52,958
[SPEAKER_09]: That should be interesting.

1083
01:10:54,118 --> 01:11:00,200
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's Thomas Howard, so all you Thomas Howard fanboys and girls will be... That is not a good Thomas Howard song.

1084
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:02,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, like it or not, there it is.

1085
01:11:03,201 --> 01:11:03,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Candy Heart...

1086
01:11:04,986 --> 01:11:06,867
[SPEAKER_09]: will be in the new DDR.

1087
01:11:07,247 --> 01:11:10,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't Stop Falling in Love, the speed mix by Naoki.

1088
01:11:10,408 --> 01:11:11,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yay, speed mix.

1089
01:11:11,349 --> 01:11:13,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Mandatory Naoki, mandatory speed mix.

1090
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:17,451
[SPEAKER_09]: A new licensed song, Castles in the Sky, Ian Vandal featuring Marsha.

1091
01:11:17,511 --> 01:11:19,051
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be a song in Xbox.

1092
01:11:19,452 --> 01:11:21,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Marsha, Marsha, Marsha!

1093
01:11:21,532 --> 01:11:23,433
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll play that for you later in the show if we have time.

1094
01:11:24,274 --> 01:11:24,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it suck?

1095
01:11:25,254 --> 01:11:25,814
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty good.

1096
01:11:25,854 --> 01:11:26,354
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it.

1097
01:11:26,434 --> 01:11:29,376
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on the same par as Will I in Max 2.

1098
01:11:29,596 --> 01:11:32,997
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I like Will I a little bit more, but Castles in the Sky is not bad.

1099
01:11:34,068 --> 01:11:40,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Dive, by B4U Do That Thing, by Masai Drop the Bomb, the System SF remix

1100
01:12:03,062 --> 01:12:14,974
[SPEAKER_09]: DXY by Tac, Electro-Tuned by Tac, Exotic Ethnic by Revengy, Healing Vision by Desire, At least it's not the stupid angelic mix.

1101
01:12:15,334 --> 01:12:15,574
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1102
01:12:15,675 --> 01:12:16,776
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't like the angelic mix?

1103
01:12:18,678 --> 01:12:22,061
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, oh my god, stop, stop, stop.

1104
01:12:22,705 --> 01:12:26,188
[SPEAKER_09]: The Angelic Mix is like one of my favorite remixes of any DDR song ever.

1105
01:12:26,209 --> 01:12:29,532
[SPEAKER_06]: The Angelic Mix gives me a splitting headache every time I listen to it.

1106
01:12:29,652 --> 01:12:30,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it just the beep?

1107
01:12:30,733 --> 01:12:32,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Take the beep out, though, and it's a beautiful remix.

1108
01:12:32,815 --> 01:12:33,616
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay.

1109
01:12:33,736 --> 01:12:34,737
[SPEAKER_06]: I still like the original better.

1110
01:12:34,877 --> 01:12:35,517
[SPEAKER_09]: You are weird.

1111
01:12:37,559 --> 01:12:39,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Hypnotic Crisis by the Blue Destroyers.

1112
01:12:40,322 --> 01:12:41,143
[SPEAKER_09]: That should be interesting.

1113
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:42,184
[SPEAKER_09]: My first Kata.

1114
01:12:42,384 --> 01:12:43,165
[SPEAKER_09]: That was my first Kata.

1115
01:12:44,119 --> 01:12:49,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Hysteria by Naoki190, because you have to have your generic Konami trying to do rap song.

1116
01:12:50,204 --> 01:12:56,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Another transplant from 2DX, and this is a really good one in my opinion, Infinite Prayer by LED.

1117
01:12:56,868 --> 01:13:00,871
[SPEAKER_09]: And what's most interesting about that is I had heard rumors that LED had left Konami.

1118
01:13:00,971 --> 01:13:06,175
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if they're true or not, but if I'm not mistaken, we haven't had any new LED songs in a while.

1119
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:08,397
[SPEAKER_09]: But kind of interesting, Infinite Prayer is going to be in DDR.

1120
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:08,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Which mix?

1121
01:13:08,897 --> 01:13:09,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it just the standard?

1122
01:13:10,673 --> 01:13:11,354
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the standard.

1123
01:13:11,394 --> 01:13:13,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Wouldn't it be cool if they put the floating clock in?

1124
01:13:13,936 --> 01:13:15,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's my favorite mix of that.

1125
01:13:15,938 --> 01:13:18,840
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be nice, and there are still ten unlocks, so you never know.

1126
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:21,182
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is the original that's going to be in it.

1127
01:13:21,342 --> 01:13:26,206
[SPEAKER_09]: But the original original was, if I'm not mistaken, a club mix song before it was a 2DX song.

1128
01:13:26,266 --> 01:13:28,728
[SPEAKER_09]: I think so.

1129
01:13:29,008 --> 01:13:37,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Insertion, the Machine Gun Kelly mix, a remix of Insertion by Thuggy D. So we can look forward to a rap mix of Insertion.

1130
01:13:37,395 --> 01:13:38,236
[SPEAKER_09]: That should be interesting.

1131
01:13:39,696 --> 01:13:43,557
[SPEAKER_09]: But that might be kind of good because there's a lot of good rap out there about insertion.

1132
01:13:46,198 --> 01:13:48,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, by the way, there's something else I need to bring after this.

1133
01:13:48,558 --> 01:13:49,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm going to stick my what?

1134
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:51,159
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to bring up something after the list.

1135
01:13:51,319 --> 01:13:53,400
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1136
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:59,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep On Movin', the DMX mix by NMR Type G. It's kind of new, very interesting.

1137
01:14:00,482 --> 01:14:01,722
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not new, says Loki.

1138
01:14:01,762 --> 01:14:02,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Where is it from?

1139
01:14:03,743 --> 01:14:04,743
[SPEAKER_09]: It's from Dance Maniacs.

1140
01:14:06,427 --> 01:14:06,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh!

1141
01:14:07,388 --> 01:14:08,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'll be damned.

1142
01:14:08,168 --> 01:14:08,709
[SPEAKER_09]: It sure is.

1143
01:14:09,049 --> 01:14:09,549
[SPEAKER_09]: My bad.

1144
01:14:10,590 --> 01:14:11,010
[SPEAKER_09]: My bad.

1145
01:14:13,431 --> 01:14:14,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, maybe we'll have to listen to that later.

1146
01:14:15,213 --> 01:14:18,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep Your Body Movin' by Thuggy D. It's a new Konami original there.

1147
01:14:19,555 --> 01:14:21,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Thuggy D. Oh, you have it?

1148
01:14:22,277 --> 01:14:27,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we going to hear it if you... Okay, so this is a little bit of Keep On Movin' in the DMX mix.

1149
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:28,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a little clip.

1150
01:14:29,941 --> 01:14:31,783
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm curious how different this is than the original.

1151
01:14:46,095 --> 01:14:48,844
[SPEAKER_22]: It's kind of ghetto.

1152
01:14:49,366 --> 01:14:50,148
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think I like it.

1153
01:14:50,269 --> 01:14:50,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

1154
01:14:50,931 --> 01:14:51,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Turn this shit off.

1155
01:14:53,991 --> 01:14:55,032
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like a bad another.

1156
01:14:55,332 --> 01:14:56,993
[SPEAKER_09]: God, I'm a stupid asshole.

1157
01:14:57,053 --> 01:14:58,374
[SPEAKER_09]: DMX Mix, of course.

1158
01:14:58,434 --> 01:14:59,835
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's Dance Maniacs Mix.

1159
01:14:59,935 --> 01:15:00,695
[SPEAKER_09]: God, I'm a tard.

1160
01:15:00,936 --> 01:15:02,136
[SPEAKER_09]: You do know some rap mix.

1161
01:15:02,176 --> 01:15:02,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

1162
01:15:03,437 --> 01:15:06,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind Lady by Okiatos.

1163
01:15:06,219 --> 01:15:06,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind Lady.

1164
01:15:06,699 --> 01:15:07,380
[SPEAKER_09]: We all know Kind Lady.

1165
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:07,800
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that song.

1166
01:15:07,820 --> 01:15:09,261
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been in like every DDR mix.

1167
01:15:09,281 --> 01:15:10,242
[SPEAKER_06]: You need the 80s one.

1168
01:15:10,582 --> 01:15:11,523
[SPEAKER_09]: I like Kind Lady, too.

1169
01:15:11,543 --> 01:15:12,123
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad it's there.

1170
01:15:12,503 --> 01:15:14,004
[SPEAKER_09]: La Señorita Virtual.

1171
01:15:14,465 --> 01:15:16,246
[SPEAKER_06]: The worst version of that song.

1172
01:15:16,766 --> 01:15:21,609
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it's... I've heard much worse DDR mixes than La Señorita Virtual.

1173
01:15:21,669 --> 01:15:23,731
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't... I never really cared for that one.

1174
01:15:24,331 --> 01:15:25,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1175
01:15:27,072 --> 01:15:35,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Also going to be in DDR Ultra Mix will be Let the Beat Hit Em, classic R&B style, because it's just not DDR without some crappy mix of Let the Beat Hit Em.

1176
01:15:35,916 --> 01:15:40,698
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, though, the only version of that one I really liked was the one that was in Max.

1177
01:15:41,138 --> 01:15:41,778
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's it.

1178
01:15:42,378 --> 01:15:42,859
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the one.

1179
01:15:42,999 --> 01:15:43,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Then that's the good one.

1180
01:15:44,839 --> 01:15:45,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's Talk It Over.

1181
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:47,460
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good song.

1182
01:15:47,601 --> 01:15:48,181
[SPEAKER_09]: It's decent.

1183
01:15:48,901 --> 01:15:50,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Look to the Sky, the True Color Mix.

1184
01:15:51,762 --> 01:15:53,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Love to Me, the Disco Mix.

1185
01:15:54,602 --> 01:15:55,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool!

1186
01:15:56,103 --> 01:15:56,743
[SPEAKER_09]: By Yamato.

1187
01:15:58,184 --> 01:15:58,985
[SPEAKER_09]: On the Jazz.

1188
01:15:59,645 --> 01:16:00,146
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cool.

1189
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:02,507
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of over On the Jazz.

1190
01:16:03,007 --> 01:16:04,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Overblast by LED Light.

1191
01:16:05,429 --> 01:16:08,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Paranoia Eternal, the fan-written Paranoia.

1192
01:16:09,572 --> 01:16:11,493
[SPEAKER_09]: A New Transplant, new to DDUltraMix.

1193
01:16:11,753 --> 01:16:13,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Quickening by DJ Taka.

1194
01:16:13,734 --> 01:16:14,635
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a very cool one.

1195
01:16:16,696 --> 01:16:21,501
[SPEAKER_09]: A licensed song, this will be a lot of fun, Paul Oakenfold with Ready Steady Go.

1196
01:16:21,741 --> 01:16:22,723
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know this song.

1197
01:16:22,843 --> 01:16:23,624
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the CD.

1198
01:16:23,664 --> 01:16:24,224
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on my CD.

1199
01:16:24,605 --> 01:16:24,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, cool.

1200
01:16:24,905 --> 01:16:26,166
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the first track, I think, on the...

1201
01:16:27,268 --> 01:16:28,168
[SPEAKER_06]: On the Bucca CD.

1202
01:16:28,228 --> 01:16:29,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we'll get to that song later.

1203
01:16:30,930 --> 01:16:36,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Santa Malente Nante, of course, a fan favorite, Togo Project featuring Sana, that'll be good.

1204
01:16:36,952 --> 01:16:38,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Secret Rendezvous by the Divas.

1205
01:16:39,473 --> 01:16:39,953
[SPEAKER_22]: Ooh.

1206
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:42,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Sexy Planet by Crystal Aliens.

1207
01:16:42,594 --> 01:16:49,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of one of those songs that a lot of people thought we wouldn't see because American audiences can't handle the word sexy.

1208
01:16:49,117 --> 01:16:50,438
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Sensual Planet!

1209
01:16:50,458 --> 01:16:55,140
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Sensual Planet, but believe it or not, it is coming to DDR Ultramix.

1210
01:16:56,903 --> 01:17:02,566
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the licensed song I'm most excited about, Shiny Disco Balls by Who Da Funk.

1211
01:17:03,266 --> 01:17:04,067
[SPEAKER_09]: I love this song.

1212
01:17:04,407 --> 01:17:05,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait to play it.

1213
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:05,908
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never heard it.

1214
01:17:06,408 --> 01:17:08,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Late night, rock and roll, fellas.

1215
01:17:08,889 --> 01:17:10,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we're going to hear a little clip of Shiny Disco Balls right here.

1216
01:17:11,291 --> 01:17:12,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we hear a clip of it?

1217
01:17:12,191 --> 01:17:12,692
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not hearing it.

1218
01:17:17,674 --> 01:17:18,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Get to the lyrics.

1219
01:17:18,395 --> 01:17:18,915
[SPEAKER_09]: The lyrics are here.

1220
01:17:21,963 --> 01:17:23,523
[SPEAKER_09]: We're skipping around the mp3 a little bit.

1221
01:17:23,843 --> 01:17:26,944
[SPEAKER_09]: This is an extended mix of the song, so here we go.

1222
01:17:30,245 --> 01:17:30,865
[SPEAKER_09]: I love this song.

1223
01:17:31,845 --> 01:17:33,445
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really repetitive, but I love it.

1224
01:17:33,465 --> 01:17:36,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, that'll be fun.

1225
01:17:36,786 --> 01:17:37,826
[SPEAKER_06]: So In Love by Caramel S. Okay.

1226
01:17:37,846 --> 01:17:37,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1227
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:48,861
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll be in the Ultramix.

1228
01:17:49,181 --> 01:17:51,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Superstar, DJ Rich featuring Tail Brothers.

1229
01:17:51,522 --> 01:17:57,765
[SPEAKER_09]: God, has there been a home mix that Superstar was not on?

1230
01:17:57,945 --> 01:18:01,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Sweet Sweet Heart Magic by June.

1231
01:18:02,487 --> 01:18:04,288
[SPEAKER_09]: The Earth Light by LED Light.

1232
01:18:04,428 --> 01:18:04,948
[SPEAKER_09]: That's cool.

1233
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:09,650
[SPEAKER_09]: A new Konami original by Thuggy D once again.

1234
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:10,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Therefore You.

1235
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:13,120
[SPEAKER_09]: That should be interesting.

1236
01:18:14,341 --> 01:18:16,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Trip Machine, The Love Mix by 2MB.

1237
01:18:17,263 --> 01:18:18,124
[SPEAKER_06]: The Love Mix.

1238
01:18:18,524 --> 01:18:21,006
[SPEAKER_09]: And lastly, yes, Loki?

1239
01:18:21,507 --> 01:18:21,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.

1240
01:18:22,227 --> 01:18:24,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Lastly, Sugaru, Revenge vs. Desire.

1241
01:18:25,069 --> 01:18:25,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Loki?

1242
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:29,113
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also one that they didn't put on there, but it's going to be an unlock.

1243
01:18:29,213 --> 01:18:31,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Mind Parasite from Dance Maniacs is going to be on there.

1244
01:18:33,036 --> 01:18:35,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, Colors is rumored to be in the game as well.

1245
01:18:36,259 --> 01:18:38,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, the interesting thing is, don't forget, there's ten unlocks.

1246
01:18:40,884 --> 01:18:47,609
[SPEAKER_09]: But also, DDR Ultramix is going to have the pay for new songs feature, which is going to be interesting.

1247
01:18:47,629 --> 01:18:48,629
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is what I've heard.

1248
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:51,251
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what's come off of DDR Freak.

1249
01:18:51,291 --> 01:19:00,238
[SPEAKER_09]: I read in some post by Order of Chaos, who's the producer for DDR Ultramix, said something about five songs, five dollars.

1250
01:19:01,959 --> 01:19:02,400
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think?

1251
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:04,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this a good idea for DDR?

1252
01:19:04,841 --> 01:19:05,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Shitty idea?

1253
01:19:05,462 --> 01:19:05,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1254
01:19:06,813 --> 01:19:09,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Only 10 unlocks this time, but 5 songs, $5.

1255
01:19:09,695 --> 01:19:11,816
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think, Loki?

1256
01:19:13,337 --> 01:19:17,280
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fine, I'm sure, because it's obviously going to download to the hard drive.

1257
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:21,722
[SPEAKER_08]: So whenever there's a transfer of files, there'll be a way to pirate the songs.

1258
01:19:21,762 --> 01:19:24,624
[SPEAKER_08]: And it doesn't matter anyways, because someone's going to buy it for $5.

1259
01:19:25,465 --> 01:19:26,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Put the sim files online.

1260
01:19:26,565 --> 01:19:32,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Dave apparently has forgotten about the little device called the Xbox GameShark.

1261
01:19:33,454 --> 01:19:34,614
[SPEAKER_06]: and people with laptops.

1262
01:19:35,154 --> 01:19:37,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Who can save those files to their laptops?

1263
01:19:38,475 --> 01:19:42,496
[SPEAKER_09]: All illegality aside, let's assume we played by the legal way here.

1264
01:19:42,536 --> 01:19:43,476
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys think of it?

1265
01:19:43,756 --> 01:19:45,517
[SPEAKER_06]: That's $5 I could get a sandwich with.

1266
01:19:46,157 --> 01:19:46,597
[SPEAKER_08]: That's only $5.

1267
01:19:46,777 --> 01:19:52,998
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I throw $5 down for lunch, so, you know, I eat at home one day, I get five songs.

1268
01:19:53,618 --> 01:20:00,440
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as they're not shit, because I can see it being, like, utter shit that they're going to put on there, but if it was good stuff, yeah.

1269
01:20:02,384 --> 01:20:09,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Let Them Move, the Let Them Move remix, the, uh, you know, uh... The Let Them Move remix by... Uh, Forever Sunshine.

1270
01:20:11,050 --> 01:20:13,672
[SPEAKER_06]: They have, like, a set of five that's all Newt remixes.

1271
01:20:14,333 --> 01:20:14,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah!

1272
01:20:16,954 --> 01:20:20,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, they're going to have a pack with Forever Sunshine and Let Them Move.

1273
01:20:21,397 --> 01:20:23,739
[SPEAKER_09]: And, God, what else is a DDR song no one likes?

1274
01:20:23,759 --> 01:20:24,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Crash.

1275
01:20:25,921 --> 01:20:27,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Crash, thank you.

1276
01:20:28,423 --> 01:20:30,204
[SPEAKER_09]: And more B4U songs.

1277
01:20:30,304 --> 01:20:32,706
[SPEAKER_09]: And then an original with Yoko Ono.

1278
01:20:34,847 --> 01:20:35,508
Yay!

1279
01:20:36,308 --> 01:20:38,930
[SPEAKER_09]: The Bag For You, the Thuggy D remix.

1280
01:20:39,331 --> 01:20:46,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it'll be Bag For You by Thuggy D. Featuring, um, what's her face from, from, uh,

1281
01:20:47,071 --> 01:20:48,373
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what song needs to be in DDR?

1282
01:20:48,513 --> 01:20:48,793
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1283
01:20:48,893 --> 01:20:49,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit.

1284
01:20:49,954 --> 01:20:50,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Shit?

1285
01:20:50,355 --> 01:20:51,236
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know that song.

1286
01:20:52,297 --> 01:20:52,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Panorama.

1287
01:20:53,858 --> 01:20:55,440
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's interesting about this mix?

1288
01:20:56,121 --> 01:20:59,004
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I'm just noticing that is very interesting about this mix?

1289
01:21:00,005 --> 01:21:03,189
[SPEAKER_09]: There is only one song in this entire mix that has Politary in it.

1290
01:21:06,858 --> 01:21:10,020
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm thinking one of those expansion packs.

1291
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:11,181
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to call it right here.

1292
01:21:11,321 --> 01:21:15,423
[SPEAKER_09]: One of those expansion packs is going to be five Naoki featuring Politary songs.

1293
01:21:15,683 --> 01:21:16,224
[SPEAKER_09]: God help us.

1294
01:21:16,244 --> 01:21:17,865
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to bet you anything.

1295
01:21:18,425 --> 01:21:20,726
[SPEAKER_09]: I know people that will buy it.

1296
01:21:21,227 --> 01:21:23,268
[SPEAKER_09]: No, there's people who like the one who can't sing.

1297
01:21:23,288 --> 01:21:28,431
[SPEAKER_09]: There's people who come to this show on Monday nights, this week, Tuesday, who like Politary.

1298
01:21:28,511 --> 01:21:30,232
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are people out there who like Politary.

1299
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,180
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just think that's interesting.

1300
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:33,520
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1301
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:39,842
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't love this feeling to be in the new... Oh, there's a shitty DDR song I forgot about.

1302
01:21:39,902 --> 01:21:40,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey!

1303
01:21:40,462 --> 01:21:42,382
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that song.

1304
01:21:42,502 --> 01:21:45,743
[SPEAKER_06]: And you remember why I... So when was Ultra Mix coming out again?

1305
01:21:46,003 --> 01:21:46,803
[SPEAKER_08]: When was this coming out?

1306
01:21:47,843 --> 01:21:51,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Ultra Mix is out November... Sometime this month.

1307
01:21:51,844 --> 01:21:52,724
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember the date.

1308
01:21:53,124 --> 01:21:53,585
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the 18th.

1309
01:21:53,605 --> 01:21:53,845
[SPEAKER_09]: The 18th.

1310
01:21:56,587 --> 01:21:57,127
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

1311
01:21:58,268 --> 01:22:01,208
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to get an Xbox anyway, so we'll see.

1312
01:22:01,408 --> 01:22:02,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold this for a second.

1313
01:22:02,389 --> 01:22:02,709
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll find out.

1314
01:22:02,729 --> 01:22:03,369
[SPEAKER_09]: You're weak.

1315
01:22:05,930 --> 01:22:07,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Jamie's going to make a phone call.

1316
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:09,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, somebody in our chat room will probably post it.

1317
01:22:10,451 --> 01:22:14,132
[SPEAKER_09]: But Jamie's going to get an official word.

1318
01:22:14,152 --> 01:22:16,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's in the same post as the song list.

1319
01:22:17,433 --> 01:22:17,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1320
01:22:18,634 --> 01:22:22,555
[SPEAKER_09]: It is the November 18th.

1321
01:22:26,306 --> 01:22:26,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1322
01:22:29,987 --> 01:22:38,130
[SPEAKER_09]: So, also rumored to be in the mix that we haven't seen any proof of yet, but Metal Gear Solid 2, the theme, I think it is.

1323
01:22:38,371 --> 01:22:40,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe it's that mix from Six Mix.

1324
01:22:41,452 --> 01:22:42,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

1325
01:22:42,852 --> 01:22:43,592
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be awesome.

1326
01:22:43,933 --> 01:22:44,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool.

1327
01:22:46,614 --> 01:22:48,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have that Paul Loganfold song?

1328
01:22:48,434 --> 01:22:49,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to play a little bit of that?

1329
01:22:50,555 --> 01:22:51,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you don't have that one.

1330
01:22:51,235 --> 01:22:52,176
[SPEAKER_09]: What about the other one that was in there?

1331
01:22:52,196 --> 01:22:53,276
[SPEAKER_09]: There was another one we said we want to play.

1332
01:22:53,336 --> 01:22:54,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Castles in the Sky, I have that one.

1333
01:22:54,617 --> 01:22:55,077
[SPEAKER_09]: I have that.

1334
01:22:55,762 --> 01:22:59,185
[SPEAKER_09]: You have that?

1335
01:22:59,425 --> 01:23:01,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's race and see who can pull it up first.

1336
01:23:03,388 --> 01:23:04,369
[SPEAKER_06]: This is really good radio.

1337
01:23:04,609 --> 01:23:05,610
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, this is great radio.

1338
01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:08,472
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, I vouch for chloroseptic.

1339
01:23:09,793 --> 01:23:10,434
[SPEAKER_09]: It really works.

1340
01:23:10,534 --> 01:23:11,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, got it.

1341
01:23:13,056 --> 01:23:13,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's Castles in the Sky.

1342
01:23:35,478 --> 01:23:37,138
[SPEAKER_09]: That's Castles in the Sky, if you're curious.

1343
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:38,699
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds pretty typical.

1344
01:23:39,439 --> 01:23:42,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it sounds very much like Will I. I prefer Will I to that song.

1345
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:50,022
[SPEAKER_09]: But I heard a rumor that the steps were going to be insane to that song.

1346
01:23:50,102 --> 01:23:50,622
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see.

1347
01:23:50,842 --> 01:23:53,942
[SPEAKER_09]: They might have some really good original steps to that.

1348
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:57,783
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a little bit of news.

1349
01:23:58,223 --> 01:23:58,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, really?

1350
01:23:58,784 --> 01:24:01,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you read anything on Yahoo?

1351
01:24:01,384 --> 01:24:02,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Give me your news.

1352
01:24:02,745 --> 01:24:04,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the FCC...

1353
01:24:05,385 --> 01:24:09,067
[SPEAKER_06]: has said that it is okay to say fuck on national television.

1354
01:24:09,187 --> 01:24:09,407
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1355
01:24:09,547 --> 01:24:09,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

1356
01:24:10,468 --> 01:24:12,729
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as it is not used to describe fucking.

1357
01:24:14,069 --> 01:24:19,012
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the same way, you know what, that's the same rule you can use to say the word fuck in a PG-13 movie.

1358
01:24:21,353 --> 01:24:23,554
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't say asshole, but you can say ass.

1359
01:24:24,354 --> 01:24:24,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Sweet.

1360
01:24:26,355 --> 01:24:29,317
[SPEAKER_09]: So now you can say fuck on TV, I can't wait for next week's South Park.

1361
01:24:30,072 --> 01:24:36,977
[SPEAKER_06]: If this is fucking annoying, or this is fucking stupid, or fuck him, or... I cannot wait for next week's South Park.

1362
01:24:37,217 --> 01:24:41,841
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it was like, and then I came up, I think it was someone who was accepting an award.

1363
01:24:42,141 --> 01:24:43,562
[SPEAKER_06]: They go, well, this is fucking awesome.

1364
01:24:44,463 --> 01:24:45,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, I heard about that.

1365
01:24:45,643 --> 01:24:46,764
[SPEAKER_06]: And the SEC got a bunch of letters.

1366
01:24:47,845 --> 01:24:53,289
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was like, well, he didn't actually say that, like, I'm going to go fuck this person.

1367
01:24:53,309 --> 01:24:55,791
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go home and fuck my wife.

1368
01:25:01,883 --> 01:25:03,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Chat room's itching for us to get our cage match on.

1369
01:25:04,425 --> 01:25:05,666
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys think?

1370
01:25:05,726 --> 01:25:06,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do it.

1371
01:25:06,646 --> 01:25:07,587
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's do it.

1372
01:25:08,368 --> 01:25:09,929
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have to think of one this week.

1373
01:25:09,969 --> 01:25:10,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know.

1374
01:25:10,409 --> 01:25:11,350
[SPEAKER_09]: You got saved this week.

1375
01:25:11,410 --> 01:25:13,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do the Orange Launch cage match tonight, shall we?

1376
01:25:15,513 --> 01:25:16,253
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what sucks?

1377
01:25:17,074 --> 01:25:17,234
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1378
01:25:17,254 --> 01:25:20,096
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I deleted Holic off my computer.

1379
01:25:20,816 --> 01:25:21,277
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

1380
01:25:21,297 --> 01:25:22,057
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's on Loki's.

1381
01:25:22,077 --> 01:25:22,758
[SPEAKER_09]: I can get it through there.

1382
01:25:23,519 --> 01:25:25,280
[SPEAKER_06]: How dare you delete any tax?

1383
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,842
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to delete so much stuff.

1384
01:25:27,902 --> 01:25:29,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Buy a hard drive!

1385
01:25:29,083 --> 01:25:32,165
[SPEAKER_09]: To make room for Final Fantasy XI, it's not even funny.

1386
01:25:32,185 --> 01:25:33,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Get a hard drive!

1387
01:25:33,806 --> 01:25:34,906
[SPEAKER_09]: That's alright, we have Holly.

1388
01:25:34,946 --> 01:25:35,687
[SPEAKER_06]: You wanna know what?

1389
01:25:35,927 --> 01:25:36,267
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1390
01:25:36,287 --> 01:25:41,351
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a 120 gig hard drive, and I've used, um, 50 of it.

1391
01:25:44,453 --> 01:25:46,574
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to start burning all stuff off of my hard drive.

1392
01:25:47,374 --> 01:25:47,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, ready?

1393
01:25:47,655 --> 01:25:48,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm lazy.

1394
01:25:48,835 --> 01:25:51,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight, in the Orange Lounge Cage Match,

1395
01:25:53,891 --> 01:25:57,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Last week in the cage match, Jamie won the cage match.

1396
01:25:58,336 --> 01:26:00,338
[SPEAKER_09]: And her song was, you want to introduce it?

1397
01:26:01,255 --> 01:26:06,919
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Little Flower by Cyberex featuring Rapina, wasn't it?

1398
01:26:07,239 --> 01:26:07,800
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was.

1399
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,161
[SPEAKER_09]: And it won by quite a landslide.

1400
01:26:11,142 --> 01:26:13,444
[SPEAKER_09]: So will it win by a landslide again tonight?

1401
01:26:13,544 --> 01:26:13,884
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1402
01:26:13,924 --> 01:26:14,284
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

1403
01:26:14,545 --> 01:26:19,408
[SPEAKER_09]: The way the cage match works, the three of us are going to pick a song, and you're going to pick your favorite.

1404
01:26:19,988 --> 01:26:30,456
[SPEAKER_09]: And your favorite, determined by your votes that are sent to me in the chat room once we've done playing all three songs, your vote will determine what song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.

1405
01:26:31,377 --> 01:26:33,459
[SPEAKER_09]: So here it is, song number one that you can vote for tonight.

1406
01:26:33,499 --> 01:26:34,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie's pick from last week.

1407
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:35,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Which one?

1408
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:37,162
[SPEAKER_09]: And you only get to hear a clip of it because it is the winner.

1409
01:26:37,703 --> 01:26:41,105
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Cyber X featuring Rapinoe with Little Flower.

1410
01:26:41,246 --> 01:26:41,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Enjoy.

1411
01:27:39,051 --> 01:27:40,353
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for watching!

1412
01:29:09,798 --> 01:29:11,699
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for watching!

1413
01:30:04,833 --> 01:30:06,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, that was song number one.

1414
01:30:06,114 --> 01:30:09,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Last week's winner, CyberX featuring Rapinoe with Little Flower.

1415
01:30:10,438 --> 01:30:13,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, and I forgot to put that in the chat room.

1416
01:30:13,461 --> 01:30:15,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually I announce what songs one and two are.

1417
01:30:15,402 --> 01:30:18,825
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Jamie, tell us how wonderful that song is while I do that part.

1418
01:30:18,846 --> 01:30:20,087
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a nine.

1419
01:30:20,667 --> 01:30:21,428
[SPEAKER_06]: It's trancy.

1420
01:30:21,808 --> 01:30:22,529
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

1421
01:30:22,569 --> 01:30:23,650
[SPEAKER_09]: You already rated it last week.

1422
01:30:23,690 --> 01:30:25,091
[SPEAKER_09]: You just have to go on about how great it is.

1423
01:30:25,511 --> 01:30:26,172
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awesome.

1424
01:30:26,372 --> 01:30:30,556
[SPEAKER_06]: You really, really like the song because y'all really seem like tramps.

1425
01:30:31,474 --> 01:30:33,636
[SPEAKER_06]: and it doesn't get much trance-ier than that.

1426
01:30:34,597 --> 01:30:40,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless it's Das Schrockenspiel, which puts me in a trance every time I drive and I usually run into things.

1427
01:30:41,322 --> 01:30:43,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, Loki insists I do his song next.

1428
01:30:45,507 --> 01:30:46,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, he's going to find it.

1429
01:30:46,248 --> 01:30:47,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, then I'm going to go next.

1430
01:30:47,569 --> 01:30:50,552
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, my song I've picked tonight is kind of an older song.

1431
01:30:50,592 --> 01:30:51,433
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a few years old.

1432
01:30:51,873 --> 01:30:58,960
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually, those of you that listen to Understation Live on a regular basis may recognize this song because I know it's one of Travis' favorite break songs.

1433
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:04,445
[SPEAKER_09]: But I've just been really addicted to this song lately, and I think it would be awesome for DDR.

1434
01:31:04,525 --> 01:31:07,388
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I'm going to convince Loki to put it on his bootleg mix that he does.

1435
01:31:08,608 --> 01:31:12,010
[SPEAKER_09]: But I love this song a lot, and I hope you guys do too.

1436
01:31:12,350 --> 01:31:16,612
[SPEAKER_09]: I really didn't have any other good choices for tonight, so I picked a nice little poppy techno song for you guys.

1437
01:31:16,632 --> 01:31:18,233
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot to make a comment on the chat room.

1438
01:31:18,313 --> 01:31:18,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1439
01:31:19,294 --> 01:31:24,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Oki is not spelled with an H. It's O-O-K-I if you're going by Papa Romaji.

1440
01:31:24,796 --> 01:31:25,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1441
01:31:26,137 --> 01:31:27,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you for clarifying.

1442
01:31:27,518 --> 01:31:27,758
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1443
01:31:28,689 --> 01:31:29,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, back to Gage Match.

1444
01:31:29,991 --> 01:31:30,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1445
01:31:30,552 --> 01:31:31,233
[SPEAKER_09]: That's alright, it's alright.

1446
01:31:32,535 --> 01:31:36,442
[SPEAKER_09]: The song I picked is Tina Cousins, and it's called Mysterious Times.

1447
01:31:36,682 --> 01:31:37,423
[SPEAKER_09]: So I hope you guys enjoy.

1448
01:33:00,837 --> 01:33:01,866
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks for watching!

1449
01:34:03,051 --> 01:34:04,895
You'll only see what you see

1450
01:34:49,433 --> 01:34:50,814
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for watching!

1451
01:35:12,142 --> 01:35:14,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that was song number two tonight.

1452
01:35:14,103 --> 01:35:16,264
[SPEAKER_09]: That was Tina Cousins with Mysterious Times.

1453
01:35:17,204 --> 01:35:17,904
[SPEAKER_09]: And what'd y'all think?

1454
01:35:17,924 --> 01:35:18,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie?

1455
01:35:18,705 --> 01:35:20,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it was pretty good.

1456
01:35:20,365 --> 01:35:23,006
[SPEAKER_06]: It was, uh, kind of repetitive.

1457
01:35:23,087 --> 01:35:24,147
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm eating rice.

1458
01:35:24,427 --> 01:35:25,447
[SPEAKER_06]: I got good rice, too.

1459
01:35:26,388 --> 01:35:27,648
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't taste like minute rice, either.

1460
01:35:27,668 --> 01:35:29,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but no.

1461
01:35:30,990 --> 01:35:31,490
[SPEAKER_06]: It was okay.

1462
01:35:32,250 --> 01:35:33,511
[SPEAKER_06]: I give it an eight.

1463
01:35:34,431 --> 01:35:34,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki!

1464
01:35:36,552 --> 01:35:37,452
[SPEAKER_08]: It was okay.

1465
01:35:38,053 --> 01:35:38,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Seven.

1466
01:35:41,278 --> 01:35:47,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I was kind of strapped for songs this week, so I know that's not the best I can do, but I still like it.

1467
01:35:48,063 --> 01:35:50,145
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's a perfect DDR song.

1468
01:35:50,185 --> 01:35:53,087
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so perfect for DDR, so I give it eight or nine.

1469
01:35:53,468 --> 01:35:53,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Eight and a half.

1470
01:35:54,649 --> 01:35:56,410
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Loki, what's your pick for this week?

1471
01:35:59,086 --> 01:36:04,827
[SPEAKER_08]: My pick for this week is Cool and the Gang, and it's a song called Get Down on It.

1472
01:36:04,947 --> 01:36:12,389
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the DJ Jimmy Jam's, I've got to get the full title here as it scrolls on by here.

1473
01:36:14,329 --> 01:36:21,651
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a Bootleg remix by DJ Jimmy Jam, whatever that is, and it's Get Down on It 2001.

1474
01:36:24,437 --> 01:36:25,139
[SPEAKER_09]: by Kool and the Gang.

1475
01:36:26,543 --> 01:36:27,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's try it out.

1476
01:36:27,586 --> 01:36:27,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Here it is.

1477
01:36:28,248 --> 01:36:29,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki's pick for this week.

1478
01:36:29,151 --> 01:36:29,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Kool and the Gang.

1479
01:36:29,713 --> 01:36:30,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Get down on it.

1480
01:38:09,878 --> 01:38:10,903
[SPEAKER_21]: We don't wanna dance

1481
01:42:27,381 --> 01:42:28,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, sorry about that.

1482
01:42:28,702 --> 01:42:31,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we were, um... Sorry, I had to get food.

1483
01:42:31,445 --> 01:42:31,725
[SPEAKER_06]: ...eating.

1484
01:42:31,745 --> 01:42:34,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me turn that down.

1485
01:42:35,488 --> 01:42:36,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry!

1486
01:42:36,529 --> 01:42:38,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, uh, Cooling the Gang with Get Down On It, 2001.

1487
01:42:39,832 --> 01:42:40,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie.

1488
01:42:41,774 --> 01:42:43,796
[SPEAKER_06]: It made me think of roller skating for some reason.

1489
01:42:44,917 --> 01:42:49,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it gets a 7.5 for nostalgic coolness.

1490
01:42:50,393 --> 01:42:50,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

1491
01:42:51,694 --> 01:42:55,475
[SPEAKER_08]: I give it a 9 because it's like the second song that's on my CD that I'm listening to right now.

1492
01:42:55,715 --> 01:42:58,197
[SPEAKER_08]: First one being last week's pick that no one seemed to like.

1493
01:43:02,178 --> 01:43:02,498
[SPEAKER_09]: I give it a 3.

1494
01:43:03,039 --> 01:43:03,479
[SPEAKER_09]: It's boring.

1495
01:43:03,979 --> 01:43:04,459
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't like it.

1496
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:06,720
[SPEAKER_09]: You get no rice now.

1497
01:43:06,980 --> 01:43:08,101
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you choke on it.

1498
01:43:08,601 --> 01:43:10,802
[SPEAKER_09]: You give my songs shitty scores all the time.

1499
01:43:10,822 --> 01:43:12,703
[SPEAKER_09]: I gave it a 7, you ass.

1500
01:43:12,723 --> 01:43:13,824
[SPEAKER_09]: This is an exception.

1501
01:43:14,384 --> 01:43:15,244
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't like it.

1502
01:43:15,424 --> 01:43:16,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Deal with it.

1503
01:43:18,106 --> 01:43:20,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool in the Gang is usually good.

1504
01:43:21,068 --> 01:43:22,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Cool in the Gang is usually good.

1505
01:43:22,209 --> 01:43:23,289
[SPEAKER_10]: It just wasn't good.

1506
01:43:23,750 --> 01:43:24,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1507
01:43:24,770 --> 01:43:26,692
[SPEAKER_09]: And what if it was Jungle Boogie?

1508
01:43:27,192 --> 01:43:28,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, who gives a shit what I think?

1509
01:43:28,693 --> 01:43:29,874
[SPEAKER_09]: It's up to the chat room now.

1510
01:43:30,314 --> 01:43:33,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Send your votes in the sky over private message once we recap here.

1511
01:43:34,177 --> 01:43:36,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Here are the three songs you can vote for tonight in tonight's cage match.

1512
01:43:36,758 --> 01:43:42,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Last week's winner, Cyber X featuring Rapinoe with Little Flower is the first song you can vote for this week.

1513
01:43:44,463 --> 01:43:45,224
[SPEAKER_09]: If I can get a clip of it.

1514
01:43:56,491 --> 01:44:01,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, song two you can vote for this week is Tina Cousins with Mysterious Times.

1515
01:44:04,133 --> 01:44:21,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, and song number three you can vote for this week is Kool and the Gang with Get Down On It, the DJ Jimmy Jam mix.

1516
01:44:30,647 --> 01:44:36,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, send those votes in now over private message to Sky in the chat room.

1517
01:44:39,213 --> 01:44:45,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Loki, is there anything going on in the sim world this week that's worth talking about?

1518
01:44:47,478 --> 01:44:47,898
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, no.

1519
01:44:49,059 --> 01:44:51,120
[SPEAKER_09]: I have my beeps, I apologize, if you guys, oh, sorry.

1520
01:44:52,386 --> 01:44:59,369
[SPEAKER_09]: If you guys are hearing beeps over the air, I apologize, I don't, they're not turned off for some reason, they got turned back on, so just deal with it.

1521
01:45:00,330 --> 01:45:08,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, no, nothing really going on, unless you count, like, Turning Mix 4th Plus, but, uh, no.

1522
01:45:09,934 --> 01:45:11,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, why don't you turn it off, you lazy bastard?

1523
01:45:12,775 --> 01:45:13,656
[SPEAKER_08]: What do I turn it off at?

1524
01:45:16,017 --> 01:45:17,618
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, people don't like hearing beeps.

1525
01:45:17,998 --> 01:45:18,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up.

1526
01:45:20,191 --> 01:45:21,792
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll see if I can find the sounds option.

1527
01:45:22,032 --> 01:45:24,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, sort of sim-related, I guess.

1528
01:45:25,774 --> 01:45:39,463
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been noted on a few of the message boards that that stupid bootleg DDR Megamix is actually running off a ported version of Step Mania to the System 573 boards, which, you know... Really?

1529
01:45:39,643 --> 01:45:44,506
[SPEAKER_08]: For those who don't know what that is, that's the hardware that all DDR machines run off of.

1530
01:45:46,527 --> 01:45:56,093
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's technically Step Mania running on that and some special software and a hacked security chip.

1531
01:45:58,215 --> 01:45:59,816
[SPEAKER_08]: So why did the freeze arrows look like shit?

1532
01:46:00,036 --> 01:46:02,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Because some of the files were corrupted on the disk.

1533
01:46:03,138 --> 01:46:03,538
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why.

1534
01:46:05,139 --> 01:46:06,760
[SPEAKER_08]: It was supposed to look nicer than that.

1535
01:46:08,822 --> 01:46:12,204
[SPEAKER_08]: But it doesn't matter though because it's still just DDR Extreme.

1536
01:46:12,224 --> 01:46:13,605
[SPEAKER_09]: They didn't add any new songs.

1537
01:46:15,986 --> 01:46:17,607
[SPEAKER_09]: My favorite, though, is Don't Fall Off.

1538
01:46:18,227 --> 01:46:20,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Don't Fall Off.

1539
01:46:21,089 --> 01:46:23,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Or the AT-ST will step on you.

1540
01:46:26,431 --> 01:46:54,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, yeah, that's pretty much all that's going on, nothing really big other than that, I mean, I'm sure, I think they're in the process of making DDR, um, or Dancing Stage Fever, converting the songs over for Stepmania, and they're still working on DDR Extreme, even though I could have had them done weeks ago, but I just don't care anymore, so, you don't get them from me, so there, and, um, yeah, that's pretty much it, nothing really, oh,

1541
01:46:55,231 --> 01:46:57,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we could talk about Into the Groove.

1542
01:46:57,760 --> 01:46:58,683
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's similar.

1543
01:46:58,703 --> 01:46:59,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

1544
01:46:59,145 --> 01:46:59,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Go for it.

1545
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:08,621
[SPEAKER_08]: A new arcade dancing game that's being developed by the people that do Step Mania.

1546
01:47:09,182 --> 01:47:13,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Chris Danford, Kiel, who you might remember, we have a song of his in rotation.

1547
01:47:13,982 --> 01:47:18,783
[SPEAKER_08]: And also Foyboy, I guess, or Fubi, I forget which one it was.

1548
01:47:19,584 --> 01:47:25,465
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was Fubi, because he does the steps on DWI Insanity.

1549
01:47:27,085 --> 01:47:30,626
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically they're making their own home version, or not home version, but...

1550
01:47:31,486 --> 01:47:45,389
[SPEAKER_08]: eventually is going to go there, but right now they're doing arcade mixes with this into the groove thing, which it's like DDR, it's more like, I don't know, it's just really weird looking.

1551
01:47:46,434 --> 01:47:47,235
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I got to say.

1552
01:48:04,229 --> 01:48:05,711
[SPEAKER_08]: They're doing those there.

1553
01:48:05,731 --> 01:48:12,198
[SPEAKER_08]: But so far, it's like, I don't know, I've listened to some of the music on there, and it sucks.

1554
01:48:12,819 --> 01:48:13,940
[SPEAKER_09]: It sucks really bad.

1555
01:48:14,361 --> 01:48:21,810
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, Kiel's good and all for, I guess, making music, but I don't like any of the music that's in there so far.

1556
01:48:21,830 --> 01:48:23,612
[SPEAKER_09]: You just think they picked the wrong ones to put in the game.

1557
01:48:25,509 --> 01:48:27,113
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, they're just lame.

1558
01:48:27,213 --> 01:48:27,975
[SPEAKER_09]: They suck.

1559
01:48:28,075 --> 01:48:31,764
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like playing that other game I was playing earlier.

1560
01:48:32,025 --> 01:48:33,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we'll have to talk about that later, too.

1561
01:48:35,339 --> 01:48:37,280
[SPEAKER_09]: God, no, it's not very good.

1562
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:46,243
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like, this one guy posted this mp3 of the song Utopia that he loves, and I downloaded it and listened to it, and it's crap.

1563
01:48:46,483 --> 01:48:47,103
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like it.

1564
01:48:47,163 --> 01:48:48,463
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's retarded.

1565
01:48:48,483 --> 01:48:50,424
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, that's just your big fat opinion.

1566
01:48:50,784 --> 01:48:54,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, my big fat opinion counts because... You have a microphone.

1567
01:48:55,085 --> 01:48:56,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I have a microphone.

1568
01:48:56,106 --> 01:48:57,246
[SPEAKER_08]: I have pretty good taste in music.

1569
01:48:57,286 --> 01:48:59,287
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of music, you know...

1570
01:48:59,807 --> 01:49:00,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1571
01:49:27,761 --> 01:49:30,502
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the stuff that should be in there, but isn't.

1572
01:49:31,063 --> 01:49:37,025
[SPEAKER_08]: But they're going to license music, they say, which I don't think they're going to actually physically license music.

1573
01:49:37,085 --> 01:49:46,169
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyways, the whole thing runs off of Linux, because they don't want to pay for Windows XP for every single machine.

1574
01:49:46,249 --> 01:49:47,569
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's running off of Linux.

1575
01:49:48,089 --> 01:49:50,871
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty much a reworked StepMania.

1576
01:49:50,911 --> 01:49:54,172
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more or less StepMania, and they have different arrows and stuff.

1577
01:49:54,693 --> 01:49:58,478
[SPEAKER_08]: New mods and shit and mines and all the crap that Stepmania has.

1578
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:01,142
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, I don't know.

1579
01:50:02,424 --> 01:50:03,245
[SPEAKER_08]: I watch people play.

1580
01:50:03,325 --> 01:50:06,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and there's songs with 11 and 12 footer steps.

1581
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:09,442
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that is so unnecessary.

1582
01:50:09,602 --> 01:50:10,243
[SPEAKER_09]: It's retarded.

1583
01:50:10,263 --> 01:50:17,629
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I shouldn't knock it until I've tried it, but I think the whole notion of songs that were built to kill people is just unnecessary.

1584
01:50:17,789 --> 01:50:20,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, Max Period was overdoing it.

1585
01:50:20,651 --> 01:50:22,052
[SPEAKER_09]: It was overdoing it.

1586
01:50:22,132 --> 01:50:26,396
[SPEAKER_09]: That end where it gets 600 beats per minute and stuff, that was just, it gets gay.

1587
01:50:27,177 --> 01:50:28,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to mention that the song was ass.

1588
01:50:29,478 --> 01:50:33,582
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, it was really, really stupid what they're doing with it, but you know.

1589
01:50:34,739 --> 01:50:35,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

1590
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:38,401
[SPEAKER_08]: They say it's 50% done.

1591
01:50:38,522 --> 01:50:41,063
[SPEAKER_08]: They can always change that stuff later if people don't like it.

1592
01:50:41,564 --> 01:50:47,768
[SPEAKER_09]: But the people they have testing it, if they're like, ooh, I get the bar rape on this song, it's harder than Legend of Max.

1593
01:50:48,508 --> 01:50:57,374
[SPEAKER_09]: With all due respect to the folks up in Seattle, there are the unreal players up there who can do this 11 and 12 stuff no problem.

1594
01:50:58,206 --> 01:51:01,770
[SPEAKER_09]: I just, I worry that that's going to influence the development of the mix.

1595
01:51:01,810 --> 01:51:07,555
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just like, you know, okay, maybe one or two songs, yay, great, but keep it to a minimum.

1596
01:51:08,096 --> 01:51:10,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Me, personally, I enjoy those fun 7 feet songs.

1597
01:51:11,039 --> 01:51:12,941
[SPEAKER_09]: I like some of the Max 2 USA Steps.

1598
01:51:12,981 --> 01:51:14,102
[SPEAKER_09]: I realize I'm in a minority.

1599
01:51:14,642 --> 01:51:18,843
[SPEAKER_09]: But I kind of like the fun stuff more than I like the let's kill me steps, you know?

1600
01:51:18,883 --> 01:51:24,645
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole point is, I mean, sure people like a challenge, but people like fun, intelligent steps, too.

1601
01:51:24,685 --> 01:51:27,886
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of songs that have intelligent steps, like Superstar.

1602
01:51:27,926 --> 01:51:30,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Superstar's a fun song to play, and it's not that hard.

1603
01:51:31,607 --> 01:51:32,207
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just fun.

1604
01:51:32,287 --> 01:51:33,008
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the whole point.

1605
01:51:33,448 --> 01:51:34,688
[SPEAKER_08]: And people play them over and over.

1606
01:51:34,948 --> 01:51:40,630
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, once you play a really hard song, the only reason you play it is to show off to friends and say, oh, look, I beat this song.

1607
01:51:40,650 --> 01:51:41,990
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's pretty much it.

1608
01:51:42,010 --> 01:51:43,651
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not like you play it for your own benefit.

1609
01:51:46,458 --> 01:51:49,019
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1610
01:51:49,460 --> 01:51:53,742
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole idea about, you know, what the hell?

1611
01:51:54,342 --> 01:51:55,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Just let Jamie play with the webcam.

1612
01:51:55,843 --> 01:51:56,403
[SPEAKER_09]: She's having fun.

1613
01:51:56,503 --> 01:51:57,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, okay.

1614
01:51:57,684 --> 01:52:04,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, it's the whole point of people making these bootlegs and stuff.

1615
01:52:04,807 --> 01:52:13,031
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, I don't know, it's very interesting to me and how Konami, because technically Konami can't really do much about it.

1616
01:52:13,647 --> 01:52:16,868
[SPEAKER_08]: because the machines aren't supposed to be over here in the first place.

1617
01:52:17,288 --> 01:52:24,409
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're kind of just getting by licensing in various manners by pretending they don't exist type of thing.

1618
01:52:25,429 --> 01:52:27,970
[SPEAKER_09]: And so kind of people have free reign on doing that.

1619
01:52:28,210 --> 01:52:32,831
[SPEAKER_09]: The only people that can come down on them are people in the United States like the RIAA and stuff like that.

1620
01:52:33,971 --> 01:52:37,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I think where they're going to run into trouble is because they're selling the machine, and that's a problem.

1621
01:52:38,490 --> 01:52:51,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, my thing on it, which I was posing to our local arcade here, is that you just do one custom homemade upgrade for...

1622
01:52:53,750 --> 01:52:54,310
[SPEAKER_08]: One Arcade.

1623
01:52:54,771 --> 01:52:59,332
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the damage done by that would be minimal and the risk on it isn't that bad.

1624
01:52:59,913 --> 01:53:02,333
[SPEAKER_08]: The repercussions would be like nothing.

1625
01:53:03,174 --> 01:53:08,336
[SPEAKER_08]: So I posed that idea to our arcade manager and they're actually interested.

1626
01:53:08,956 --> 01:53:10,056
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know.

1627
01:53:10,177 --> 01:53:10,517
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

1628
01:53:11,857 --> 01:53:22,205
[SPEAKER_08]: But I know later this week I'm going down to the arcade and we're going to rip open the machine to see what we can do as far as feasibly upgrading it that way.

1629
01:53:23,026 --> 01:53:28,550
[SPEAKER_08]: And all I've got to say is if I do end up doing that, it's going to look nice and it'll be a lot better than all this other shit.

1630
01:53:29,091 --> 01:53:33,414
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've got word from... I heard this.

1631
01:53:33,434 --> 01:53:34,575
[SPEAKER_08]: This was pretty big news.

1632
01:53:35,780 --> 01:53:36,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, supposedly.

1633
01:53:36,601 --> 01:53:36,981
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1634
01:53:37,241 --> 01:53:40,224
[SPEAKER_08]: They posted this about the next generation DDR.

1635
01:53:40,584 --> 01:53:42,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah?

1636
01:53:42,325 --> 01:53:45,107
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's going to be coming out in like two or three years.

1637
01:53:45,508 --> 01:53:46,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my God.

1638
01:53:47,689 --> 01:53:48,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1639
01:53:48,230 --> 01:53:52,693
[SPEAKER_09]: What about this Euromix that they're getting that's going to be on the new hardware, supposedly?

1640
01:53:52,993 --> 01:53:54,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's Euromix.

1641
01:53:54,855 --> 01:53:57,056
[SPEAKER_09]: But still... They get stuff.

1642
01:53:57,077 --> 01:54:00,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, remember, if you remember... It'll be a preview of what we can expect.

1643
01:54:00,359 --> 01:54:04,002
[SPEAKER_09]: They were supposed to do new hardware with DDR Extreme, but they never did.

1644
01:54:04,022 --> 01:54:04,722
[SPEAKER_08]: True, true.

1645
01:54:05,023 --> 01:54:05,303
[SPEAKER_09]: So...

1646
01:54:07,926 --> 01:54:14,550
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, for all this talk that DDR is dead in Japan, I mean, then why was Xtreme the number 7 selling game its debut week in the top 10?

1647
01:54:14,590 --> 01:54:15,130
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter.

1648
01:54:15,150 --> 01:54:16,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at QDX.

1649
01:54:17,091 --> 01:54:19,513
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to freaking beg for a new game.

1650
01:54:19,633 --> 01:54:20,713
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a whole other story, though.

1651
01:54:20,734 --> 01:54:22,254
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just Konami being dicks.

1652
01:54:24,816 --> 01:54:26,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, you guys want to know who won the cage match tonight?

1653
01:54:27,017 --> 01:54:29,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

1654
01:54:29,338 --> 01:54:34,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge cage match is Holic.

1655
01:54:34,661 --> 01:54:35,182
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's...

1656
01:54:37,503 --> 01:54:39,324
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a tie, ladies and gentlemen.

1657
01:54:41,385 --> 01:54:42,325
[SPEAKER_09]: The tie tonight.

1658
01:54:42,345 --> 01:54:43,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop tying people, God.

1659
01:54:43,926 --> 01:54:45,947
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, they always tie like every week.

1660
01:54:46,067 --> 01:54:50,489
[SPEAKER_09]: We used to never have ties, and lately in like past eight shows we've had like six ties.

1661
01:54:50,969 --> 01:54:53,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, the tie tonight is between two songs.

1662
01:54:54,551 --> 01:54:57,353
[SPEAKER_09]: It's between last week's winner, Little Flower.

1663
01:55:04,136 --> 01:55:04,296
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

1664
01:55:05,023 --> 01:55:10,625
[SPEAKER_09]: The second song that tied this week is Cooling the Gang with Get Down On It, the 2001 mix.

1665
01:55:12,806 --> 01:55:24,049
[SPEAKER_09]: So, as you know, when we have a tie in the Orange Lounge Cage Match, the host who did not win in the tie would get to break that tie.

1666
01:55:24,109 --> 01:55:25,310
[SPEAKER_09]: And, oh, that's me tonight.

1667
01:55:26,210 --> 01:55:28,131
[SPEAKER_09]: My song only got one stinking vote.

1668
01:55:29,071 --> 01:55:30,211
[SPEAKER_09]: Your song sucks.

1669
01:55:30,631 --> 01:55:31,472
[SPEAKER_09]: That being said...

1670
01:55:33,516 --> 01:55:34,499
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a no-brainer.

1671
01:55:34,539 --> 01:55:38,088
[SPEAKER_09]: I vote for Jamie's.

1672
01:55:39,170 --> 01:55:40,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, you the man.

1673
01:55:41,755 --> 01:55:51,357
[SPEAKER_09]: But that song is the suck, so I pick Little Flowers, this week's cage match winner, for two weeks in a row, so enjoy.

1674
01:55:51,497 --> 01:55:52,558
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the dog.

1675
01:55:53,538 --> 01:56:03,600
[SPEAKER_08]: That's alright, I was going to pick something really shitty, but I could not find that damn track for the life of me.

1676
01:56:04,461 --> 01:56:05,681
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Boys for Love.

1677
01:56:06,501 --> 01:56:07,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, what?

1678
01:56:07,782 --> 01:56:08,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Boys for Love.

1679
01:56:09,144 --> 01:56:11,586
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was a song about being gay, but I couldn't find it.

1680
01:56:12,186 --> 01:56:14,028
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was really funny.

1681
01:56:14,288 --> 01:56:17,330
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just like, it's a DDR song I had, but I can't find it.

1682
01:56:17,531 --> 01:56:18,411
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know where it went.

1683
01:56:18,972 --> 01:56:20,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to put it in your mix?

1684
01:56:22,915 --> 01:56:24,036
[SPEAKER_08]: I could, that would be funny.

1685
01:56:24,056 --> 01:56:26,318
[SPEAKER_09]: If I find it, maybe.

1686
01:56:27,139 --> 01:56:27,499
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1687
01:56:31,322 --> 01:56:34,345
[SPEAKER_09]: So... I think I'll take a break.

1688
01:56:37,366 --> 01:56:40,507
[SPEAKER_09]: When we come back, we'll do the FUs of the week.

1689
01:56:40,667 --> 01:56:43,228
[SPEAKER_09]: So send those over private message to Sky.

1690
01:56:43,248 --> 01:56:44,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, I'm in the chat room.

1691
01:56:44,448 --> 01:56:48,869
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you have something to bitch about, we're going to get it out in the open on this next break.

1692
01:56:49,569 --> 01:56:52,190
[SPEAKER_09]: In the meantime, we've done a TAC break.

1693
01:56:52,230 --> 01:56:53,250
[SPEAKER_09]: We've done a TACA break.

1694
01:56:53,951 --> 01:56:58,192
[SPEAKER_09]: I think now, like it or not, I think it's time to do Naoki break.

1695
01:56:58,212 --> 01:56:58,832
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you guys think?

1696
01:57:00,833 --> 01:57:01,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't cry.

1697
01:57:02,353 --> 01:57:03,873
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we're going to play some good Naoki stuff.

1698
01:57:03,913 --> 01:57:05,574
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will be right back after this break.

1699
01:57:57,400 --> 01:57:58,802
Thanks for watching!

1700
02:00:43,502 --> 02:00:44,184
Thanks for watching!

1701
02:02:27,918 --> 02:02:36,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter D, the letter A, and the number 59.

1702
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:42,241
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

1703
02:02:42,622 --> 02:02:46,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello everybody, it's time to do the FUs of the week.

1704
02:02:47,023 --> 02:02:49,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, what are the FUs of the week all about?

1705
02:02:50,003 --> 02:02:52,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Where we get pissed off and tell everybody.

1706
02:03:08,414 --> 02:03:10,756
[SPEAKER_06]: My first FU of the week is a very important one.

1707
02:03:12,797 --> 02:03:14,158
[SPEAKER_06]: FU to adultery.

1708
02:03:16,080 --> 02:03:21,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to go into specifics about it because it involves a pretty good friend of mine.

1709
02:03:23,846 --> 02:03:26,848
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's no excuse for it.

1710
02:03:28,201 --> 02:03:37,165
[SPEAKER_06]: and I can't really vouch for anyone who goes through with it who is... I'm not getting into details, but just in general.

1711
02:03:38,205 --> 02:03:39,605
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't, I can't stand it.

1712
02:03:40,986 --> 02:03:41,226
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

1713
02:03:41,686 --> 02:03:42,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Next thing!

1714
02:03:42,226 --> 02:03:54,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, uh, F you to people who go 10 miles under the speed limit in front of you and then people who match your speed in the lane next to you so that you can't change lanes.

1715
02:03:56,512 --> 02:03:56,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1716
02:03:59,082 --> 02:04:02,667
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, I'm not really all that angsty because I'm still looking forward to my vacation.

1717
02:04:03,988 --> 02:04:04,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Gasp.

1718
02:04:05,751 --> 02:04:14,442
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to probably not having reliable internet access while I'm in Alabama.

1719
02:04:15,455 --> 02:04:16,435
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'll do what I can.

1720
02:04:17,036 --> 02:04:22,417
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, F you for no remote way of me contributing to the show.

1721
02:04:25,958 --> 02:04:26,859
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really about it.

1722
02:04:26,979 --> 02:04:28,379
[SPEAKER_06]: I did, however, notice something.

1723
02:04:29,019 --> 02:04:34,181
[SPEAKER_06]: The Radio Shack logo looks remarkably like the Battle Royale logo.

1724
02:04:35,201 --> 02:04:36,602
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a government plot.

1725
02:04:38,403 --> 02:04:42,604
[SPEAKER_06]: They're gonna make us all kill each other with remote-controlled cars, batteries, and Walkmans.

1726
02:04:44,747 --> 02:04:46,549
[SPEAKER_06]: and PhilPort, a PCS for everybody.

1727
02:04:47,070 --> 02:04:47,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1728
02:04:49,212 --> 02:04:49,592
[SPEAKER_06]: E.T.

1729
02:04:49,632 --> 02:04:50,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Stallio.

1730
02:04:53,617 --> 02:04:54,097
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1731
02:04:54,758 --> 02:04:55,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you ready?

1732
02:04:58,702 --> 02:04:59,744
[SPEAKER_08]: I caught the mic.

1733
02:05:00,464 --> 02:05:00,965
Okay.

1734
02:05:04,415 --> 02:05:06,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, yes, I am.

1735
02:05:08,078 --> 02:05:10,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck you, you stupid bastards at Golf Land.

1736
02:05:11,462 --> 02:05:15,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Not necessarily people, because, you know, people will be stupid and they'll flock no matter.

1737
02:05:16,826 --> 02:05:22,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I'm saying the bastards working behind the snack counter at Golf Land yesterday around 7 p.m.

1738
02:05:25,057 --> 02:05:29,441
[SPEAKER_08]: You suck because first off you had to go make a stupid comment about my shirt.

1739
02:05:29,642 --> 02:05:34,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I know what my shirt says and the fact that you comment about it does not make you seem any more intelligent.

1740
02:05:35,768 --> 02:05:44,656
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't care if your friend is afraid of ninja monkeys or ninja squirrels or any ninja rodent of whatever the case may be.

1741
02:05:45,537 --> 02:05:48,020
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care and I also don't care that

1742
02:05:48,815 --> 02:06:15,255
[SPEAKER_09]: you're out of the large cup size, I want a soda, give me a fucking soda and just because you're stupid enough to drop the piece of pizza on the floor and you give me the larger slice by calling it the special piece of pizza, I don't really care and the fact that you tried to give me the piece of pizza attached to the giant cardboard circle it was on there to begin with I want it on a fucking plate

1743
02:06:15,976 --> 02:06:19,279
[SPEAKER_08]: And you try to get me on this giant piece of cardboard, what the hell am I supposed to do with that?

1744
02:06:20,499 --> 02:06:21,861
[SPEAKER_08]: This guy was a complete idiot.

1745
02:06:22,941 --> 02:06:25,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Not surprising, you know, working at Golfland.

1746
02:06:26,104 --> 02:06:26,564
[SPEAKER_08]: But yes.

1747
02:06:27,905 --> 02:06:37,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, other than that, um, I don't like the cold, so fuck you Mother Nature for making it cold all of a sudden.

1748
02:06:37,592 --> 02:06:40,475
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like 90 degrees one day, and then it dropped down to 50.

1749
02:06:41,565 --> 02:06:46,287
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't just drop the temperature 40 degrees and expect anyone to, like, not care.

1750
02:06:49,589 --> 02:06:50,509
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a comment to make.

1751
02:06:51,810 --> 02:06:52,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1752
02:06:52,390 --> 02:06:57,733
[SPEAKER_06]: I talk to what the weather is in Alabama right now, and at nighttime, the low is 66 degrees.

1753
02:06:59,053 --> 02:07:01,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's cool.

1754
02:07:02,515 --> 02:07:07,698
[SPEAKER_08]: And fuck you to my bank, because I was overdrawn on my account for, like, five bucks, and they charged me 60.

1755
02:07:09,398 --> 02:07:10,499
[SPEAKER_08]: So, they suck.

1756
02:07:13,001 --> 02:07:13,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Sue them!

1757
02:07:13,501 --> 02:07:14,961
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't sue them.

1758
02:07:15,041 --> 02:07:17,342
[SPEAKER_06]: All you have to do is get a credit card with your bank.

1759
02:07:18,022 --> 02:07:21,182
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you overdraft, it pulls from your card and you're not charged any fines.

1760
02:07:21,663 --> 02:07:23,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1761
02:07:23,923 --> 02:07:25,483
[SPEAKER_08]: See, I used to do that, too.

1762
02:07:25,623 --> 02:07:26,803
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to have a credit card.

1763
02:07:27,063 --> 02:07:28,144
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a big mistake.

1764
02:07:28,184 --> 02:07:34,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Because not only do they charge you the $30 for overdrafting, they charge you a fee on your credit card, too.

1765
02:07:34,625 --> 02:07:36,065
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a big scam.

1766
02:07:37,085 --> 02:07:38,385
[SPEAKER_06]: What bank do you bank with?

1767
02:07:38,605 --> 02:07:39,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Wells Fargo.

1768
02:07:39,566 --> 02:07:40,306
[SPEAKER_06]: No wonder.

1769
02:07:40,386 --> 02:07:40,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell's Cargo.

1770
02:07:43,228 --> 02:07:47,150
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyways, yeah, they suck, but whatever.

1771
02:07:47,650 --> 02:07:48,531
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I'm done.

1772
02:07:52,432 --> 02:07:52,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1773
02:07:56,794 --> 02:07:59,775
[SPEAKER_09]: My FU this week is a real no-brainer for me, actually.

1774
02:08:01,536 --> 02:08:11,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually I have to sit here and think about what I'm going to say FU of the week to for a long time, but this week it's easy because I got really pissed off at Final Fantasy XI earlier this week.

1775
02:08:12,429 --> 02:08:24,777
[SPEAKER_10]: so my app used to play online the Sony people because when you put in your credit card information you can't put in a space bar your name is not allowed to have spaces if you don't

1776
02:08:26,666 --> 02:08:31,129
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, if you have a space in your name, you don't exist to the Final Fantasy people.

1777
02:08:31,730 --> 02:08:35,372
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I had to call tech support and all that stuff.

1778
02:08:35,672 --> 02:08:40,395
[SPEAKER_09]: And they don't take... They won't register you over the phone at tech support for whatever reason.

1779
02:08:40,415 --> 02:08:40,915
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why.

1780
02:08:41,236 --> 02:08:43,517
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure if I bitched or whined enough, they probably would have.

1781
02:08:43,537 --> 02:08:46,099
[SPEAKER_09]: But luckily, the guy and I were able to make it work somehow, so...

1782
02:08:46,619 --> 02:08:47,900
[SPEAKER_09]: I finally was able to get online.

1783
02:08:47,940 --> 02:08:51,943
[SPEAKER_09]: The guy on the other end of the line at PlayOnline was actually very nice.

1784
02:08:51,963 --> 02:08:58,027
[SPEAKER_09]: It was very good customer service and tech support, so it helped ease my anger a little bit.

1785
02:08:58,067 --> 02:09:03,711
[SPEAKER_09]: But whoever thought that one up to disable the space bar, come on, why do you disable keys?

1786
02:09:03,751 --> 02:09:05,292
[SPEAKER_09]: You never know when somebody might need to use it.

1787
02:09:05,452 --> 02:09:10,075
[SPEAKER_09]: And for the record, I go by my middle name, actually, so I use my first initial.

1788
02:09:10,435 --> 02:09:14,378
[SPEAKER_09]: My bank has me in the system as my first initial space middle name.

1789
02:09:15,118 --> 02:09:18,979
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I'm something space Robert in the system.

1790
02:09:19,339 --> 02:09:20,319
[SPEAKER_09]: So, that's why.

1791
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:23,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know you know, but we can keep it a secret.

1792
02:09:23,960 --> 02:09:25,401
[SPEAKER_06]: I promise.

1793
02:09:25,501 --> 02:09:26,941
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a nice name for me.

1794
02:09:27,461 --> 02:09:28,442
[SPEAKER_09]: So, whatever.

1795
02:09:29,602 --> 02:09:30,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Name shmame.

1796
02:09:30,662 --> 02:09:35,243
[SPEAKER_09]: So, screw you, whoever decided to come up with that disabling the space bar.

1797
02:09:35,263 --> 02:09:37,504
[SPEAKER_09]: We're out in hell.

1798
02:09:38,303 --> 02:09:41,785
[SPEAKER_09]: And it took me, I'll also FU to Final Fantasy XI because it took me about five hours to install.

1799
02:09:42,065 --> 02:09:44,326
[SPEAKER_09]: But once I got in there, oh, fuck, it's beautiful.

1800
02:09:46,066 --> 02:09:50,328
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm wondering if I installed the data I have, if it would work.

1801
02:09:50,588 --> 02:09:53,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Either way, you're going to have to sit there and download the two-hour patch.

1802
02:09:54,650 --> 02:09:57,171
[SPEAKER_09]: I doubt it will work, but it's worth a try.

1803
02:09:57,191 --> 02:10:00,012
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to pay for anything.

1804
02:10:00,032 --> 02:10:01,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know there's people who already have.

1805
02:10:02,882 --> 02:10:04,864
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the beta people had to upgrade, I think.

1806
02:10:04,904 --> 02:10:05,805
[SPEAKER_06]: That's stupid.

1807
02:10:07,186 --> 02:10:08,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank God for Ragnarok.

1808
02:10:08,547 --> 02:10:10,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1809
02:10:10,990 --> 02:10:12,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Into the chatroom, FUs.

1810
02:10:14,733 --> 02:10:20,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Bag4U says, Hey Sky, send an FU to Konami for being anal about the 2DX release.

1811
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:24,222
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree, that was kind of stupid of Konami.

1812
02:10:25,705 --> 02:10:29,866
[SPEAKER_09]: 23rd Magus says, F you to slow leveling in Ragnarok Online.

1813
02:10:30,386 --> 02:10:33,546
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to my DDR skills slipping, I can't pass Sakura anymore.

1814
02:10:33,907 --> 02:10:36,627
[SPEAKER_09]: And a big F you to concert tickets being so overpriced.

1815
02:10:36,987 --> 02:10:38,787
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, but $30 a seat?

1816
02:10:38,927 --> 02:10:39,187
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1817
02:10:39,447 --> 02:10:40,948
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to rate my wallet some more?

1818
02:10:41,088 --> 02:10:41,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn.

1819
02:10:42,088 --> 02:10:43,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, $30 is actually pretty cheap for a concert.

1820
02:10:43,908 --> 02:10:44,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't feel bad.

1821
02:10:44,628 --> 02:10:47,609
[SPEAKER_06]: I was pricing the tickets for Alan Jackson and they're $45 apiece.

1822
02:10:48,429 --> 02:10:50,029
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to go see Elton John in Vegas?

1823
02:10:50,089 --> 02:10:51,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Prepare to pay $100 for the cheap seats.

1824
02:10:53,570 --> 02:10:53,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Crazy.

1825
02:10:56,607 --> 02:10:58,668
[SPEAKER_09]: God, it's just nuts how much some tickets cost.

1826
02:10:59,048 --> 02:11:04,230
[SPEAKER_09]: John Fields would like to say, F you to Microsoft, your piece of shit software thinks my D drive is corrupt.

1827
02:11:04,310 --> 02:11:08,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I have to rebuild my computer while trying to save as many files as I can.

1828
02:11:08,392 --> 02:11:11,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you Microsoft and your XPOS.

1829
02:11:11,553 --> 02:11:13,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck you to twisting my ankle today.

1830
02:11:13,414 --> 02:11:14,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and fuck you to Microsoft again.

1831
02:11:14,934 --> 02:11:20,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not just use a second hard drive and move the data?

1832
02:11:20,997 --> 02:11:21,477
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1833
02:11:22,579 --> 02:11:27,360
[SPEAKER_09]: When I installed Final Fantasy XI, something similar happened to me where it was trying to boot for my disk drive.

1834
02:11:28,401 --> 02:11:31,521
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank God Brad was here because he was able to fix it.

1835
02:11:31,861 --> 02:11:32,742
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't have known what to do.

1836
02:11:32,802 --> 02:11:34,062
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have broken down and cried.

1837
02:11:34,982 --> 02:11:36,663
[SPEAKER_09]: At the $50, I would have wasted on nothing.

1838
02:11:38,623 --> 02:11:38,903
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1839
02:11:40,384 --> 02:11:40,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

1840
02:11:40,984 --> 02:11:45,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Joe Mama would like to say, My FU of the week is to the shitty PC controls for Final Fantasy XI.

1841
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:53,386
[SPEAKER_09]: I got used to the PC controls myself, but I received a tip from LankyStyle, who was a beta tester for Final Fantasy XI.

1842
02:11:53,426 --> 02:11:54,767
[SPEAKER_09]: He says, use a Kiki Joy.

1843
02:11:54,807 --> 02:11:55,968
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes it a lot easier.

1844
02:11:56,388 --> 02:12:00,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Get the PlayStation controller hooked up to the computer, and you'll enjoy Final Fantasy XI a lot more.

1845
02:12:01,433 --> 02:12:02,374
[SPEAKER_09]: I will try that in the future.

1846
02:12:03,482 --> 02:12:12,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Snub Dishonored says, Fuck the children that didn't come to my house and left me with about five full pounds of Kit Kats, Twixes, and various other assorted candies.

1847
02:12:13,245 --> 02:12:14,045
[SPEAKER_05]: You're complaining?

1848
02:12:14,085 --> 02:12:14,606
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll take them.

1849
02:12:15,266 --> 02:12:17,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I have to eat all this crap or throw it out.

1850
02:12:18,027 --> 02:12:20,187
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks a lot, you fucking overprotective parents.

1851
02:12:20,227 --> 02:12:22,348
[SPEAKER_09]: You're saving your kids but killing my bowels.

1852
02:12:22,868 --> 02:12:24,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Runs to bathroom to shit out chocolate.

1853
02:12:24,729 --> 02:12:25,369
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's lovely.

1854
02:12:26,067 --> 02:12:29,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I should have poisoned my candy to give those parents a real reason to keep their kids at home.

1855
02:12:30,049 --> 02:12:32,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, then you'd still be stuck with it, and then you'd just have to throw it away.

1856
02:12:32,530 --> 02:12:33,791
[SPEAKER_06]: God, it's a waste of chocolate.

1857
02:12:33,971 --> 02:12:34,291
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1858
02:12:34,451 --> 02:12:34,991
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1859
02:12:35,051 --> 02:12:35,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Take it to school.

1860
02:12:40,394 --> 02:12:40,514
[SPEAKER_09]: No, 830.

1861
02:12:42,276 --> 02:12:56,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Wampa164 would like to say, fuck you to the hot topic raver wannabe 14 year olds who spend their entire weekend from Friday until Sunday at the mall's arcade and causing me to not single digit grade exotic ethnic, going from 4 grades within 15 seconds left to 14.

1862
02:12:59,126 --> 02:13:01,867
[SPEAKER_09]: This T underscore T brought to you by me.

1863
02:13:04,389 --> 02:13:04,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Minced.

1864
02:13:06,002 --> 02:13:07,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Went home from college for the weekend.

1865
02:13:08,004 --> 02:13:09,465
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the basis of my FU.

1866
02:13:09,945 --> 02:13:11,226
[SPEAKER_09]: FU to the local arcade.

1867
02:13:11,246 --> 02:13:12,587
[SPEAKER_09]: They now have a pump-it-up machine.

1868
02:13:12,627 --> 02:13:15,930
[SPEAKER_09]: It lags every time you hit an arrow and sometimes the song will just cut out.

1869
02:13:16,710 --> 02:13:19,372
[SPEAKER_09]: They should have gotten the second DDR machine they said they were gonna get.

1870
02:13:19,512 --> 02:13:22,735
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck you to it raining for 11 days straight over here.

1871
02:13:22,875 --> 02:13:25,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they don't know the difference between pump-it-up and DDR.

1872
02:13:28,616 --> 02:13:33,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Zodiac Knight would like to say, I have no fuck you's because I love everyone equally.

1873
02:13:34,364 --> 02:13:35,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Awww.

1874
02:13:37,027 --> 02:13:37,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Hairball, sorry.

1875
02:13:40,091 --> 02:13:45,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Pixie Dust would like to say, okay, fuck this, I'm actually happy, I only have three F you's this week.

1876
02:13:46,860 --> 02:13:51,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck Bacardi151 and being drunk to the point where I passed out when I got home.

1877
02:13:51,543 --> 02:13:54,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck dieting because I'm still the same damn weight.

1878
02:13:54,545 --> 02:13:59,808
[SPEAKER_09]: And as always, just because what if you wouldn't be complete without Pixie Dust saying, Fuck having big boobs.

1879
02:13:59,968 --> 02:14:03,870
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't do step aerobics properly with these things flopping like two puppies.

1880
02:14:04,550 --> 02:14:06,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'm done and love you, Rob.

1881
02:14:07,252 --> 02:14:07,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Love you too.

1882
02:14:08,213 --> 02:14:08,793
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

1883
02:14:09,173 --> 02:14:11,515
[SPEAKER_09]: And notice how no love for Jamie or Loki.

1884
02:14:11,555 --> 02:14:12,495
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all me.

1885
02:14:12,655 --> 02:14:13,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, shut up.

1886
02:14:13,096 --> 02:14:13,656
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the best.

1887
02:14:14,762 --> 02:14:15,863
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you know what?

1888
02:14:16,163 --> 02:14:20,166
[SPEAKER_06]: They make an exercise bra that's really good for big boob women.

1889
02:14:21,607 --> 02:14:23,609
[SPEAKER_06]: I used it for a while.

1890
02:14:25,530 --> 02:14:25,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Boobs.

1891
02:14:28,172 --> 02:14:28,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Loki?

1892
02:14:30,374 --> 02:14:31,114
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you doing, Loki?

1893
02:14:34,497 --> 02:14:35,758
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to go to the next FU.

1894
02:14:35,838 --> 02:14:36,819
[SPEAKER_06]: I just need someone to comment on.

1895
02:14:36,839 --> 02:14:37,139
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1896
02:14:37,159 --> 02:14:40,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, what do you want to comment on?

1897
02:14:41,242 --> 02:14:42,503
[SPEAKER_06]: BananaBoobs.com?

1898
02:14:42,543 --> 02:14:42,723
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1899
02:14:43,403 --> 02:14:43,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1900
02:14:45,546 --> 02:14:45,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1901
02:14:49,708 --> 02:14:53,089
[SPEAKER_06]: About the dieting thing, don't diet, do a lifestyle adjustment.

1902
02:14:54,610 --> 02:14:55,010
[SPEAKER_09]: That's good.

1903
02:14:56,631 --> 02:14:59,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and she says in the public chat room, love you, Jamie.

1904
02:15:00,733 --> 02:15:02,174
[SPEAKER_20]: Yay, we love you too.

1905
02:15:04,294 --> 02:15:05,455
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the link you're going to post?

1906
02:15:07,296 --> 02:15:09,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Some boob thing, some straight man thing.

1907
02:15:11,098 --> 02:15:14,001
[SPEAKER_09]: This game rocks, and this is for you, Pixie Dust.

1908
02:15:14,541 --> 02:15:16,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Frontal Assault, the ultimate boob game.

1909
02:15:17,403 --> 02:15:19,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, this game rocks, okay?

1910
02:15:19,505 --> 02:15:20,166
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just awesome.

1911
02:15:22,448 --> 02:15:25,010
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Spector would like to say, fuck you to Max 300.

1912
02:15:26,291 --> 02:15:26,851
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree.

1913
02:15:27,012 --> 02:15:30,715
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been a while since I've said fuck you to Max 300, but goddamn, the Maxes suck.

1914
02:15:30,735 --> 02:15:31,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Get over it.

1915
02:15:32,216 --> 02:15:36,780
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Spector would also like to say, fuck you to my fucking asshole of a Spanish teacher that I have.

1916
02:15:39,139 --> 02:15:43,963
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, my Spanish 2 teacher, my least favorite teacher of all... No, my second least favorite teacher of all time.

1917
02:15:44,683 --> 02:15:45,304
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, Rob?

1918
02:15:45,444 --> 02:15:45,624
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1919
02:15:45,664 --> 02:15:46,424
[SPEAKER_06]: I never took Spanish.

1920
02:15:48,226 --> 02:15:50,187
[SPEAKER_06]: But I took French and Japanese at the same time.

1921
02:15:50,367 --> 02:15:51,108
[SPEAKER_05]: ¿Cómo te llamas?

1922
02:15:53,389 --> 02:15:54,010
[SPEAKER_05]: ¡Fuego!

1923
02:15:56,612 --> 02:15:58,353
[SPEAKER_05]: El teléfono es el fuego.

1924
02:15:58,413 --> 02:15:59,214
[SPEAKER_00]: ¡Lucha libre!

1925
02:15:59,794 --> 02:16:01,075
[SPEAKER_05]: ¿Dónde está el baño?

1926
02:16:01,455 --> 02:16:05,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like all the words I know in Spanish right there is lucha libre and...

1927
02:16:06,224 --> 02:16:16,192
[SPEAKER_09]: LastFU, Telemundo, Wampa164 would like to say, Fuck Halloween for being a shitty holiday that's more of an excuse for people to vandalize people houses and property by teenagers.

1928
02:16:17,293 --> 02:16:19,134
[SPEAKER_04]: The end.

1929
02:16:20,495 --> 02:16:25,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Pixie Dust also says, I love Loki too, but don't tell Nelly.

1930
02:16:28,801 --> 02:16:34,766
[SPEAKER_09]: As Loki brings up the world domination of the boob game that Jamie is watching.

1931
02:16:35,379 --> 02:16:36,840
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck is this?

1932
02:16:36,880 --> 02:16:41,882
[SPEAKER_09]: It's this giant pair of tits that you kind of use your hand to kind of throw.

1933
02:16:45,863 --> 02:16:51,286
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of like DDR in a way because these little things scroll down the screen and you have to do the steps.

1934
02:16:52,246 --> 02:16:53,627
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to do tricks with the boobs.

1935
02:16:53,647 --> 02:16:58,629
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you either have to swing them one way or you do like a spiral or you have to just bounce them up and down.

1936
02:16:58,969 --> 02:17:00,169
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all very interesting.

1937
02:17:03,251 --> 02:17:03,651
[SPEAKER_10]: I swear.

1938
02:17:06,286 --> 02:17:09,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, as Jamie is fascinated by the boob game.

1939
02:17:09,836 --> 02:17:10,960
[SPEAKER_06]: This game is stupid.

1940
02:17:14,699 --> 02:17:16,521
[SPEAKER_09]: I think what we'll do is we'll take another break.

1941
02:17:16,961 --> 02:17:17,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1942
02:17:18,823 --> 02:17:21,525
[SPEAKER_09]: And this break is going to be an LED break.

1943
02:17:22,206 --> 02:17:31,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody suggested to me, I forgot who, but I'm sure they'll be happy to hear that we're going to do an LED break because LED is awesome, and we need to hear some more LED songs.

1944
02:17:31,314 --> 02:17:34,177
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to play some right now for you guys.

1945
02:17:34,417 --> 02:17:36,198
[SPEAKER_09]: So enjoy this break, and we'll be back.

1946
02:17:36,759 --> 02:17:38,801
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to do listless when we come back, yes?

1947
02:17:39,562 --> 02:17:39,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1948
02:17:40,082 --> 02:17:40,362
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1949
02:17:40,622 --> 02:17:41,043
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be back.

1950
02:18:02,636 --> 02:18:03,979
Ranma S and Destroyer

1951
02:19:58,857 --> 02:20:00,599
DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1952
02:21:59,189 --> 02:22:00,112
Thanks for watching!

1953
02:22:27,851 --> 02:22:30,155
[SPEAKER_22]: Chile, Pimson, Nessie

1954
02:23:43,078 --> 02:23:43,698
Thanks for watching!

1955
02:24:17,172 --> 02:24:17,894
Thanks for watching!

1956
02:25:05,840 --> 02:25:09,982
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

1957
02:25:10,242 --> 02:25:11,923
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you one of these staffers by Hollywood?

1958
02:25:12,003 --> 02:25:12,363
[SPEAKER_20]: No!

1959
02:25:12,463 --> 02:25:16,065
[SPEAKER_20]: Do we care what people think of us?

1960
02:25:16,705 --> 02:25:18,566
[SPEAKER_20]: No!

1961
02:25:18,586 --> 02:25:20,006
[SPEAKER_20]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

1962
02:25:20,487 --> 02:25:22,728
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes!

1963
02:25:24,569 --> 02:25:26,409
[SPEAKER_17]: Extreme Bomani Radio.

1964
02:25:26,649 --> 02:25:27,290
[SPEAKER_17]: That's us.

1965
02:25:27,850 --> 02:25:29,371
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1966
02:25:30,703 --> 02:25:33,626
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's funny is that promo predates DDR Extreme.

1967
02:25:34,687 --> 02:25:35,708
[SPEAKER_06]: That promo?

1968
02:25:36,309 --> 02:25:37,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1969
02:25:38,871 --> 02:25:40,533
[SPEAKER_06]: That was made right before the second show.

1970
02:25:41,454 --> 02:25:43,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I was gone for the second and third shows.

1971
02:25:44,417 --> 02:25:46,118
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in Alabama.

1972
02:25:46,259 --> 02:25:52,165
[SPEAKER_09]: I swear to God, when you get back from Alabama before season four premieres, we're going to sit down and do new promos for season four.

1973
02:25:52,185 --> 02:25:53,546
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's going to be our treat to everybody.

1974
02:25:53,806 --> 02:25:57,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, I'm back the whole Wednesday with nothing going on.

1975
02:26:18,501 --> 02:26:23,544
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember somebody said Guardian Legend because Guardian Legend comes up on every list.

1976
02:26:24,745 --> 02:26:26,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Something like that.

1977
02:26:27,026 --> 02:26:29,588
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm almost positive that was done before, so we decided to shelve it.

1978
02:26:30,729 --> 02:26:37,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead, we thought we'd go the other way around and say movie they most need to make a game out of.

1979
02:26:37,073 --> 02:26:39,714
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't done listless in a long, long time, so I'm going to explain how this works.

1980
02:26:39,734 --> 02:26:41,515
[SPEAKER_06]: This is excluding ones that have already been done, by the way.

1981
02:26:41,575 --> 02:26:43,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, excluding ones that have already been done.

1982
02:26:43,496 --> 02:26:45,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Or similar, because that took half of mine.

1983
02:26:46,229 --> 02:26:47,750
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1984
02:27:07,168 --> 02:27:31,426
[SPEAKER_09]: and then we're going to have our big list, the definitive list and then we'll go around and the fun part is we each take one off one that we feel is not deserving to be there, it really shouldn't be there so we're going to take one off then the chatroom gets the ultimate say, the chatroom gets to vote on the definitive top three list tonight's topic, movie they most need to make a game out of so, here we go

1985
02:27:32,651 --> 02:27:35,256
[SPEAKER_09]: First up, we have... Wait, you want to start, Jamie?

1986
02:27:35,276 --> 02:27:35,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

1987
02:27:35,676 --> 02:27:37,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, Jamie, your number four pick for tonight.

1988
02:27:37,580 --> 02:27:40,365
[SPEAKER_06]: The number four should be The NeverEnding Story.

1989
02:27:41,767 --> 02:27:42,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Make it an RPG.

1990
02:27:43,390 --> 02:27:44,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Any reason why NeverEnding Story?

1991
02:27:45,514 --> 02:27:45,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Just...

1992
02:27:48,911 --> 02:27:50,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it would have a kick-ass theme song.

1993
02:27:50,612 --> 02:27:51,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, quite.

1994
02:27:51,353 --> 02:27:56,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear God, I hope... I want the whole... I want a whole... Ring in.

1995
02:27:57,117 --> 02:27:58,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, then take that off the list.

1996
02:27:58,999 --> 02:28:00,380
[SPEAKER_06]: On PC, PC games don't count.

1997
02:28:00,420 --> 02:28:01,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, take it off.

1998
02:28:01,641 --> 02:28:02,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Dua.

1999
02:28:02,422 --> 02:28:02,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Aw.

2000
02:28:02,842 --> 02:28:03,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Labyrinth.

2001
02:28:04,363 --> 02:28:06,084
[SPEAKER_09]: I know they had a Labyrinth game on Commodore 64.

2002
02:28:06,365 --> 02:28:08,646
[SPEAKER_09]: But that can be one of those really old games that needs to be updated.

2003
02:28:09,607 --> 02:28:09,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2004
02:28:10,088 --> 02:28:10,708
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Labyrinth.

2005
02:28:12,529 --> 02:28:14,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Because then that means rendered David Bowie.

2006
02:28:15,071 --> 02:28:15,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

2007
02:28:15,532 --> 02:28:15,992
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2008
02:28:16,613 --> 02:28:16,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2009
02:28:16,893 --> 02:28:16,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2010
02:28:18,830 --> 02:28:19,491
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody played it.

2011
02:28:19,751 --> 02:28:20,992
[SPEAKER_09]: It was on Commodore 64.

2012
02:28:21,072 --> 02:28:21,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody played it.

2013
02:28:22,073 --> 02:28:22,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2014
02:28:23,034 --> 02:28:23,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways.

2015
02:28:25,536 --> 02:28:30,120
[SPEAKER_08]: My pick is going to be... God, there's so many.

2016
02:28:33,023 --> 02:28:39,328
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to have to go with Showgirls because I can see it now.

2017
02:28:39,408 --> 02:28:42,090
[SPEAKER_08]: You're struggling to get to the top of the world.

2018
02:28:42,130 --> 02:28:43,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Do whatever it takes.

2019
02:28:43,872 --> 02:28:45,994
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a story about survival.

2020
02:28:47,404 --> 02:28:48,085
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that idea.

2021
02:28:48,105 --> 02:28:54,028
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds like it would be a really emotional kind of game with a really great backstory.

2022
02:28:54,048 --> 02:28:54,909
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't know shit!

2023
02:28:55,009 --> 02:28:55,909
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't know shit!

2024
02:28:57,110 --> 02:28:59,151
[SPEAKER_09]: One of my very favorite movies of all time.

2025
02:28:59,452 --> 02:29:00,893
[SPEAKER_09]: A pick close to my heart, Loki.

2026
02:29:00,953 --> 02:29:01,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2027
02:29:03,494 --> 02:29:04,455
[SPEAKER_09]: My number four pick...

2028
02:29:05,180 --> 02:29:20,616
[SPEAKER_09]: is a game that it actually did have a game back in the 80s and they even updated it somewhat recently but all it was was a newer version of the 80s game and it sucks I want them to just scrap it all and do a new one The Rocky Horror Picture Show Is it a game?

2029
02:29:21,055 --> 02:29:23,476
[SPEAKER_09]: They did a game and it sucks ass, so they need a new one.

2030
02:29:23,797 --> 02:29:24,577
[SPEAKER_06]: What was this on?

2031
02:29:24,777 --> 02:29:26,538
[SPEAKER_09]: It was on Apple 2E.

2032
02:29:27,499 --> 02:29:32,101
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they did an updated version of it not too long ago, but it was just an updated version.

2033
02:29:32,301 --> 02:29:32,801
[SPEAKER_09]: It sucked.

2034
02:29:33,042 --> 02:29:35,403
[SPEAKER_09]: They need to totally just scrap the concept and do a new one.

2035
02:29:35,423 --> 02:29:36,484
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to give them a do-over.

2036
02:29:36,844 --> 02:29:40,726
[SPEAKER_09]: And technically, it's a game based on the play.

2037
02:29:40,906 --> 02:29:42,627
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a Rocky Horror show game.

2038
02:29:42,987 --> 02:29:46,269
[SPEAKER_09]: So they haven't done the game for the Rocky Horror picture show.

2039
02:29:46,609 --> 02:29:47,630
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's my loophole.

2040
02:29:47,670 --> 02:29:49,931
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll be missing a couple of songs there.

2041
02:29:54,306 --> 02:29:56,147
[SPEAKER_09]: My number four pick is the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

2042
02:29:56,568 --> 02:29:56,888
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2043
02:29:57,248 --> 02:29:57,909
[SPEAKER_09]: My number three.

2044
02:29:58,569 --> 02:29:59,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Number three, Jamie.

2045
02:29:59,690 --> 02:30:01,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Monty Python and the Holy Grail RPG.

2046
02:30:03,733 --> 02:30:09,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Just think of the potential, especially with, who was it that did it, Terry Gilliam?

2047
02:30:10,058 --> 02:30:10,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

2048
02:30:10,739 --> 02:30:12,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Doing all the artwork for it.

2049
02:30:12,280 --> 02:30:13,641
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be awesome.

2050
02:30:13,661 --> 02:30:14,922
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be awesome.

2051
02:30:15,002 --> 02:30:15,402
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd love it.

2052
02:30:15,682 --> 02:30:18,785
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, they need to insert the... The one-on-one with the Black Knight.

2053
02:30:18,825 --> 02:30:20,106
[SPEAKER_06]: The Ministry of Coconuts.

2054
02:30:20,126 --> 02:30:20,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.

2055
02:30:20,846 --> 02:30:21,647
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, a little snippety.

2056
02:30:21,667 --> 02:30:22,628
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be a rhythm game.

2057
02:30:22,688 --> 02:30:23,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Proper use of the coconut.

2058
02:30:24,824 --> 02:30:26,545
[SPEAKER_09]: They could be a special controller.

2059
02:30:27,366 --> 02:30:29,908
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd play as, what was his squire's name, Patsy.

2060
02:30:29,928 --> 02:30:30,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

2061
02:30:31,169 --> 02:30:32,269
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you can eat the minstrels.

2062
02:30:32,469 --> 02:30:34,511
[SPEAKER_10]: You can eat the minstrels.

2063
02:30:35,772 --> 02:30:36,933
[SPEAKER_22]: And that was much rejoicing.

2064
02:30:37,113 --> 02:30:37,993
Yay.

2065
02:30:38,454 --> 02:30:39,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, your number three pick.

2066
02:30:40,315 --> 02:30:43,057
[SPEAKER_08]: A newer one that just came to my head right now.

2067
02:30:44,778 --> 02:30:46,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Orgasmo, the video game.

2068
02:30:47,800 --> 02:30:48,221
Orgasmo.

2069
02:30:49,542 --> 02:30:50,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Pink Flamingo's The Game

2070
02:31:20,191 --> 02:31:22,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Pink Flamingos is a John Waters early movie.

2071
02:31:22,892 --> 02:31:24,953
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one of the most disgusting films ever made.

2072
02:31:24,993 --> 02:31:26,353
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's about two people.

2073
02:31:26,873 --> 02:31:31,114
[SPEAKER_09]: I should say three people because there's a couple and Divine, of course, in one of her best roles ever.

2074
02:31:31,415 --> 02:31:34,575
[SPEAKER_09]: They're in a competition to be the filthiest person in the world.

2075
02:31:34,996 --> 02:31:39,357
[SPEAKER_09]: And imagine if you could participate in that competition to be the filthiest person in the world.

2076
02:31:39,617 --> 02:31:41,878
[SPEAKER_09]: And at the end, like the last stage, you can eat dog shit.

2077
02:31:42,978 --> 02:31:45,159
[SPEAKER_06]: I just had an odd thought.

2078
02:31:45,439 --> 02:31:45,619
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

2079
02:31:47,333 --> 02:31:50,154
[SPEAKER_06]: They've made, created a machine that merges two people into one.

2080
02:31:51,014 --> 02:31:52,975
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they take John Waters and John Hughes.

2081
02:31:55,396 --> 02:31:55,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine!

2082
02:31:55,756 --> 02:31:57,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you just get hairspray.

2083
02:31:57,616 --> 02:31:58,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

2084
02:31:58,997 --> 02:31:59,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, anyway.

2085
02:32:00,177 --> 02:32:01,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Your number three pick, Jamie.

2086
02:32:01,398 --> 02:32:01,938
[SPEAKER_06]: My number three pick.

2087
02:32:01,958 --> 02:32:02,678
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, your number two pick.

2088
02:32:02,698 --> 02:32:04,039
[SPEAKER_06]: My number two pick is Kill Bill.

2089
02:32:05,679 --> 02:32:09,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Having to go through your enemies, and then all the fight scenes play like Bushido Blade.

2090
02:32:09,500 --> 02:32:10,801
[SPEAKER_09]: God damn you, that was my number one.

2091
02:32:12,418 --> 02:32:14,899
[SPEAKER_06]: You better not take my number one or I'll kick your ass.

2092
02:32:14,999 --> 02:32:15,360
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2093
02:32:16,120 --> 02:32:17,220
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what my number one is.

2094
02:32:18,261 --> 02:32:18,721
[SPEAKER_09]: I can guess.

2095
02:32:18,821 --> 02:32:19,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

2096
02:32:21,343 --> 02:32:22,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, this one should be easy.

2097
02:32:24,624 --> 02:32:27,626
[SPEAKER_08]: The Oral Adventures of Kraven Moorhead.

2098
02:32:29,347 --> 02:32:32,528
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

2099
02:32:32,768 --> 02:32:33,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Please explain.

2100
02:32:34,449 --> 02:32:37,891
[SPEAKER_09]: I can see this one playing out like Commander Keen or something like that.

2101
02:32:40,285 --> 02:32:42,066
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a porno movie, folks!

2102
02:32:42,706 --> 02:32:45,367
[SPEAKER_09]: But hey, it's got 17 videos already.

2103
02:32:45,767 --> 02:32:49,468
[SPEAKER_09]: With a movie, you know, with a franchise that large, it needs a game.

2104
02:32:52,129 --> 02:32:54,190
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, alright, alright, fair enough.

2105
02:32:55,550 --> 02:33:02,052
[SPEAKER_09]: My number two pick... Right... My number two pick is a movie you probably have never seen, but I'll explain it for you.

2106
02:33:02,192 --> 02:33:04,513
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Trick, the game.

2107
02:33:06,920 --> 02:33:14,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Trick is a nice little piece of gay cinema that's about two guys that just run into each other on the subway that are trying desperately to find a place to fuck.

2108
02:33:15,444 --> 02:33:17,445
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm thinking this will make an exciting video game.

2109
02:33:18,086 --> 02:33:19,527
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be like one of those stealth games.

2110
02:33:19,707 --> 02:33:20,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you ever played Thief?

2111
02:33:21,387 --> 02:33:22,008
[SPEAKER_09]: That could be it.

2112
02:33:22,068 --> 02:33:25,369
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be like, we've got to find a place to screw right now.

2113
02:33:25,390 --> 02:33:26,970
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a time limit and everything.

2114
02:33:27,551 --> 02:33:28,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Trick the game.

2115
02:33:28,131 --> 02:33:30,792
[SPEAKER_09]: And it could even have a cameo from Tori Spelling, just like the movie did.

2116
02:33:30,812 --> 02:33:31,453
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be beautiful.

2117
02:33:31,893 --> 02:33:33,854
[SPEAKER_09]: So Trick the Game is my number two pick.

2118
02:33:35,195 --> 02:33:35,995
[SPEAKER_06]: My number one.

2119
02:33:36,536 --> 02:33:37,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you're number one, Jamie.

2120
02:33:37,717 --> 02:33:45,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I was thinking of Scanners, but then again, there was Galarians, where you have people thinking at people hard enough that it makes their heads explode.

2121
02:33:45,927 --> 02:33:46,608
[SPEAKER_06]: They already did that.

2122
02:33:47,469 --> 02:33:48,390
[SPEAKER_06]: And all kinds of others.

2123
02:33:48,811 --> 02:33:53,657
[SPEAKER_06]: But I figured, in keeping with, because it's me, we'd have Battle Royale.

2124
02:33:54,057 --> 02:33:54,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

2125
02:33:55,814 --> 02:34:01,519
[SPEAKER_06]: And it would work and make it like you have survival horror mode or you have multiplayer mode.

2126
02:34:02,080 --> 02:34:06,784
[SPEAKER_06]: And then your friends, if you've got Xbox, put it on Xbox, network those bad boys.

2127
02:34:07,025 --> 02:34:08,746
[SPEAKER_06]: You could have the whole classroom.

2128
02:34:09,947 --> 02:34:10,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Who would win?

2129
02:34:11,649 --> 02:34:12,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Think about it.

2130
02:34:12,550 --> 02:34:12,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

2131
02:34:13,371 --> 02:34:13,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Catch.

2132
02:34:14,969 --> 02:34:19,550
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Loki, your number one pick for a movie that most needs to be a game.

2133
02:34:20,410 --> 02:34:26,891
[SPEAKER_09]: No one except for maybe the people in the studio have actually seen this movie since it's that awful.

2134
02:34:27,272 --> 02:34:31,232
[SPEAKER_08]: But it needs a game, and I will put the picture up on the cam.

2135
02:34:32,093 --> 02:34:34,793
[SPEAKER_09]: It is Cheerleader Ninjas, the movie.

2136
02:34:34,893 --> 02:34:35,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Cheerleader Ninjas.

2137
02:34:36,653 --> 02:34:38,334
[SPEAKER_09]: I would love to see a game for this.

2138
02:34:43,595 --> 02:34:43,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

2139
02:34:45,977 --> 02:34:49,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you briefly explain what this movie is about for those that may not have seen it?

2140
02:34:50,103 --> 02:34:55,110
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about these cheerleaders who are being blamed for smut on the internet.

2141
02:34:55,490 --> 02:34:57,193
[SPEAKER_08]: And they have to fight these nuns.

2142
02:34:57,853 --> 02:35:00,497
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's this gay guy who's like the head, you know...

2143
02:35:01,398 --> 02:35:02,499
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2144
02:35:22,332 --> 02:35:24,714
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if this movie had a game.

2145
02:35:24,994 --> 02:35:27,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie took my number one, so I'm having a stretch here.

2146
02:35:28,236 --> 02:35:30,178
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm thinking the more I think about it, this would be an awesome game.

2147
02:35:30,198 --> 02:35:31,018
[SPEAKER_09]: It may have already had one.

2148
02:35:31,058 --> 02:35:31,539
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, though.

2149
02:35:31,759 --> 02:35:33,260
[SPEAKER_09]: Did Starship Troopers have a game?

2150
02:35:33,320 --> 02:35:33,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2151
02:35:33,680 --> 02:35:34,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn it.

2152
02:35:36,042 --> 02:35:37,864
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a 3D first-person shooter game.

2153
02:35:38,284 --> 02:35:39,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn it, damn it, damn it.

2154
02:35:39,785 --> 02:35:40,185
[SPEAKER_08]: I got one.

2155
02:35:40,546 --> 02:35:43,068
[SPEAKER_08]: You can do Contact, the game.

2156
02:35:43,228 --> 02:35:43,448
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

2157
02:35:43,468 --> 02:35:46,590
[SPEAKER_08]: You play through the whole game and you find out that the boss is just her dad.

2158
02:35:46,650 --> 02:35:46,771
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

2159
02:35:49,491 --> 02:35:50,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck that.

2160
02:35:50,331 --> 02:35:51,432
[SPEAKER_09]: No contact the game.

2161
02:35:51,472 --> 02:35:52,172
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want that shit.

2162
02:35:52,192 --> 02:35:52,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Geely the game.

2163
02:35:53,152 --> 02:35:54,213
[SPEAKER_09]: You struggle.

2164
02:35:54,233 --> 02:35:54,273
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

2165
02:35:54,933 --> 02:35:56,314
[SPEAKER_09]: No Geely the game either.

2166
02:35:56,634 --> 02:35:57,994
[SPEAKER_09]: I need more ideas.

2167
02:35:58,214 --> 02:36:03,656
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I'm liking the idea of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back the game.

2168
02:36:03,796 --> 02:36:05,277
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say that.

2169
02:36:05,577 --> 02:36:06,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Or better yet, Clerks.

2170
02:36:06,977 --> 02:36:07,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do Clerks.

2171
02:36:07,918 --> 02:36:08,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Clerks the game.

2172
02:36:08,618 --> 02:36:09,338
[SPEAKER_09]: That was on my list.

2173
02:36:09,558 --> 02:36:10,319
[SPEAKER_09]: That was on my list.

2174
02:36:10,339 --> 02:36:12,319
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to do Clerks the game.

2175
02:36:12,539 --> 02:36:14,740
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not even supposed to be in this game.

2176
02:36:14,800 --> 02:36:16,421
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not even supposed to play this today.

2177
02:36:17,583 --> 02:36:18,584
[SPEAKER_09]: That could be the tagline.

2178
02:36:18,624 --> 02:36:19,304
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be beautiful.

2179
02:36:19,425 --> 02:36:22,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Or it could be like a sports game, Clerks Rooftop Hockey.

2180
02:36:22,687 --> 02:36:23,027
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2181
02:36:23,568 --> 02:36:24,749
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a collection of minigames.

2182
02:36:26,270 --> 02:36:28,191
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can get the alternate ending.

2183
02:36:29,532 --> 02:36:31,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah.

2184
02:36:31,594 --> 02:36:32,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Where everyone dies.

2185
02:36:34,116 --> 02:36:35,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't that what happened?

2186
02:36:35,477 --> 02:36:36,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, he just got shot.

2187
02:36:37,218 --> 02:36:38,039
[SPEAKER_09]: The original ending.

2188
02:36:38,139 --> 02:36:38,439
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2189
02:36:38,800 --> 02:36:39,620
[SPEAKER_09]: So here we are.

2190
02:36:39,720 --> 02:36:41,001
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the list we have so far.

2191
02:36:41,062 --> 02:36:42,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Next up is the elimination round.

2192
02:36:43,203 --> 02:36:44,064
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Labyrinth.

2193
02:36:44,793 --> 02:37:00,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Showgirls, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Orgasmo, Pink Flamingos, Kill Bill, The Oral Adventures of Kraven Moorhead, Trick, Battle Royale, Cheerleader Ninjas, and Clerks.

2194
02:37:01,480 --> 02:37:03,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, what has to come off this list?

2195
02:37:09,375 --> 02:37:09,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Showgirls.

2196
02:37:11,597 --> 02:37:14,599
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, but I don't see how that could be made into a game.

2197
02:37:14,959 --> 02:37:15,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie.

2198
02:37:15,659 --> 02:37:17,300
[SPEAKER_09]: You're killing me.

2199
02:37:17,561 --> 02:37:20,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless it played like the Spice Girls game, which sucks.

2200
02:37:20,383 --> 02:37:21,363
[SPEAKER_09]: You're killing me, Jamie.

2201
02:37:21,623 --> 02:37:23,285
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be a dance game.

2202
02:37:23,345 --> 02:37:25,606
[SPEAKER_09]: They would never be able to do it justice.

2203
02:37:27,087 --> 02:37:27,567
[SPEAKER_09]: You're right.

2204
02:37:27,608 --> 02:37:28,008
[SPEAKER_09]: You're right.

2205
02:37:28,028 --> 02:37:29,449
[SPEAKER_09]: They could never do it justice.

2206
02:37:29,889 --> 02:37:30,429
[SPEAKER_09]: You're right.

2207
02:37:30,509 --> 02:37:30,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2208
02:37:31,130 --> 02:37:32,571
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm okay with that pick now, Jamie.

2209
02:37:32,631 --> 02:37:33,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2210
02:37:33,772 --> 02:37:35,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, your turn to take something off the list.

2211
02:37:36,153 --> 02:37:37,434

02:41:34,194 --> 02:41:41,040
[SPEAKER_09]: Enjoy during this break while we tally the listless votes for a movie that you would most like to see a video game made out of.

[SPEAKER_09]: The definitive list, coming back when we come back.

2304
02:42:53,195 --> 02:42:54,077
Thanks for watching!

2305
02:44:21,196 --> 02:44:22,377

[SPEAKER_19]: and more.

2307
02:46:22,562 --> 02:46:22,957
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for watching!

2308
02:46:52,864 --> 02:46:57,807
[SPEAKER_19]: From StepSquad to OrangeLabs, this DDR sucks!

2309
02:46:57,887 --> 02:46:59,788
[SPEAKER_22]: Holla, Holla, Holla!

2310
02:46:59,808 --> 02:46:59,908
[SPEAKER_22]: GGPO!

2311
02:47:12,068 --> 02:47:14,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

2312
02:47:14,249 --> 02:47:23,415
[SPEAKER_09]: I know the suspense is killing you, but here it is, the definitive list as decided by us, Loki, DarkSakura, and Skye.

2313
02:47:23,955 --> 02:47:25,036
[SPEAKER_09]: And a little help from the chat room.

2314
02:47:27,537 --> 02:47:30,499
[SPEAKER_09]: www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.

2315
02:47:30,559 --> 02:47:31,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, here it is.

2316
02:47:32,860 --> 02:47:37,863
[SPEAKER_09]: The top three movies you would like to see made into a game.

2317
02:47:38,643 --> 02:47:41,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Number three, Kill Bill.

2318
02:47:42,530 --> 02:47:48,216
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people when they were voting said, you know, I was going to vote for Kill Bill, but I think they're going to make that into a game anyway.

2319
02:47:48,497 --> 02:47:49,578
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are probably right.

2320
02:47:49,638 --> 02:47:54,423
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say on this entire list, Kill Bill is the one I think is most likely going to be a game, if anything.

2321
02:47:54,443 --> 02:47:54,824
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

2322
02:47:55,204 --> 02:47:58,568
[SPEAKER_09]: But Tarantino is such a big nerd that I could see it happening.

2323
02:47:59,008 --> 02:48:00,650
[SPEAKER_09]: But Kill Bill is your number three pick.

2324
02:48:00,970 --> 02:48:04,094
[SPEAKER_09]: But there were two films on this list you want to see even more than Kill Bill.

2325
02:48:04,895 --> 02:48:07,900
[SPEAKER_09]: and number two is Clerks.

2326
02:48:08,621 --> 02:48:09,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Clerks the game.

2327
02:48:10,425 --> 02:48:17,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, so you guys want to just be lazy in your video games as well as your real life, I guess, because there wouldn't be a lot to do in Clerks the game.

2328
02:48:19,117 --> 02:48:20,639
[SPEAKER_09]: The animated series will be fun, I think.

2329
02:48:20,799 --> 02:48:22,560
[SPEAKER_09]: So there it is, Clerks the Game.

2330
02:48:23,081 --> 02:48:28,506
[SPEAKER_09]: And your number one pick, I think this is pretty much a no-brainer, you guys, Battle Royale the Game.

2331
02:48:29,867 --> 02:48:32,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Best, I mean, this could be a Doom killer right here.

2332
02:48:32,690 --> 02:48:35,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck Quake, fuck Doom, Battle Royale would be where it's at.

2333
02:48:38,575 --> 02:48:40,176
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, somebody should make a Quake mod.

2334
02:48:40,356 --> 02:48:45,241
[SPEAKER_06]: I talked to someone who was actually trying to do one in Counter-Strike, but of course it wasn't really going to work.

2335
02:48:46,892 --> 02:48:47,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there you go.

2336
02:48:47,532 --> 02:48:50,053
[SPEAKER_09]: The list has decided by you and us.

2337
02:48:50,433 --> 02:48:51,373
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no disputing it.

2338
02:48:51,473 --> 02:48:51,993
[SPEAKER_09]: That is it.

2339
02:48:52,093 --> 02:48:55,194
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the list of movies that most need to be a game.

2340
02:48:56,654 --> 02:49:07,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so now that we're back, Loki, we haven't even really referenced this yet in the show, but Loki would like to share with you this new game he downloaded this week.

2341
02:49:07,956 --> 02:49:09,657
[SPEAKER_09]: And, Loki, you want to tell us a little more about this?

2342
02:49:10,497 --> 02:49:11,917
Yeah.

2343
02:49:11,937 --> 02:49:15,318
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, the chair is being attacked by the microphone cords again.

2344
02:49:17,324 --> 02:49:19,005
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that should be a movie or a game.

2345
02:49:19,345 --> 02:49:20,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Attack of the Killer Microphone Court.

2346
02:49:25,888 --> 02:49:26,488
[SPEAKER_09]: You okay there?

2347
02:49:26,728 --> 02:49:27,289
[SPEAKER_09]: Need some help?

2348
02:49:28,129 --> 02:49:28,609
[SPEAKER_09]: You gonna make it?

2349
02:49:31,671 --> 02:49:34,392
[SPEAKER_09]: You're just in the middle of traffic, I think, is what happens to it.

2350
02:49:34,792 --> 02:49:35,993
[SPEAKER_06]: I was the one sitting in it.

2351
02:49:36,053 --> 02:49:36,833
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't do anything.

2352
02:49:36,953 --> 02:49:38,754
[SPEAKER_09]: She was spinning around and around and around.

2353
02:49:42,836 --> 02:49:43,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2354
02:49:43,496 --> 02:49:44,277
[SPEAKER_09]: You okay, Loki?

2355
02:49:44,497 --> 02:49:44,937
[SPEAKER_09]: You gonna make it?

2356
02:49:45,529 --> 02:49:46,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to be okay?

2357
02:49:46,830 --> 02:49:47,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, he's ready.

2358
02:49:47,731 --> 02:49:49,593
[SPEAKER_09]: He's ready to tell you all about the game.

2359
02:49:50,634 --> 02:49:51,234
[SPEAKER_09]: I am safe.

2360
02:49:51,875 --> 02:49:54,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2361
02:49:54,617 --> 02:49:58,661
[SPEAKER_08]: This game is this company's answer to DDR.

2362
02:49:58,701 --> 02:50:03,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, this game will take the world by storm and you will never know what DDR is.

2363
02:50:03,345 --> 02:50:05,166
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll just go, oh my god, this game rocks.

2364
02:50:06,387 --> 02:50:07,849
[SPEAKER_08]: At least that's what they would like to think.

2365
02:50:08,689 --> 02:50:10,351
[SPEAKER_08]: This game is called Tap-A-Jam.

2366
02:50:11,712 --> 02:50:12,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Tap-A-Jam.

2367
02:50:14,059 --> 02:50:17,461
[SPEAKER_08]: and Tapajam is, well, it's interesting.

2368
02:50:21,143 --> 02:50:22,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Tapajam loading.

2369
02:50:22,944 --> 02:50:26,706
[SPEAKER_08]: And what wonderful songs can you expect in Tapajam?

2370
02:50:27,306 --> 02:50:28,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let's see.

2371
02:50:28,247 --> 02:50:29,488
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all public domain music.

2372
02:50:29,588 --> 02:50:37,332
[SPEAKER_08]: So, we have wonderful songs like Cannon and Bee, Flight of the Bumblebee,

2373
02:50:39,824 --> 02:50:42,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, these are top quality songs, you guys.

2374
02:50:42,685 --> 02:50:43,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Moonlight Sonata.

2375
02:50:45,925 --> 02:50:46,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Blue Danube.

2376
02:50:47,966 --> 02:50:48,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Danube.

2377
02:50:50,386 --> 02:50:52,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Simon Says Disco Fingers.

2378
02:50:52,887 --> 02:50:53,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knows what that is?

2379
02:50:56,087 --> 02:50:56,907
[SPEAKER_08]: And more shit.

2380
02:50:57,908 --> 02:50:58,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and Chopsticks.

2381
02:50:58,888 --> 02:50:59,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Chopsticks.

2382
02:51:01,068 --> 02:51:04,549
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can see Loki and I are so mature when we play at our high score table.

2383
02:51:07,419 --> 02:51:10,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Ass is in first place and cunts in second place.

2384
02:51:11,381 --> 02:51:12,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we're so mature.

2385
02:51:13,703 --> 02:51:13,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2386
02:51:13,963 --> 02:51:15,124
[SPEAKER_09]: So now we're going to show the game here.

2387
02:51:15,144 --> 02:51:18,226
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll get Jamie's reaction.

2388
02:51:18,426 --> 02:51:19,666
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll describe it for our listeners.

2389
02:51:20,007 --> 02:51:24,809
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically... Oh, man, you changed the... Oh, I changed the controls.

2390
02:51:24,909 --> 02:51:25,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, guys.

2391
02:51:27,211 --> 02:51:27,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah.

2392
02:51:28,658 --> 02:51:34,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, you have this up, down, left, right arrow, but it's on the left side of the screen.

2393
02:51:34,419 --> 02:51:37,860
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've had, you know, we've had DDRs at the top, Beat Manias at the bottom.

2394
02:51:38,080 --> 02:51:40,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, now we have a game where it's on the left side of the screen.

2395
02:51:41,480 --> 02:51:43,861
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you have the up, left, right, and down arrows.

2396
02:51:45,101 --> 02:51:45,761
[SPEAKER_09]: It's left, Loki.

2397
02:51:46,181 --> 02:51:46,681
[SPEAKER_09]: That one's left.

2398
02:51:48,021 --> 02:51:48,721
[SPEAKER_09]: And then right and down.

2399
02:51:50,062 --> 02:51:57,203
[SPEAKER_09]: And as the notes scroll over to the left, you have to hit them when they come in this column, is the way this works.

2400
02:51:59,241 --> 02:52:00,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, what happened to my mouse?

2401
02:52:00,482 --> 02:52:00,842
[SPEAKER_09]: There it goes.

2402
02:52:02,723 --> 02:52:03,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Okie dokie.

2403
02:52:03,543 --> 02:52:05,584
[SPEAKER_09]: And what website can they download this from, Loki?

2404
02:52:07,025 --> 02:52:08,505
[SPEAKER_09]: It's that, like, game... If they would really want to?

2405
02:52:08,525 --> 02:52:13,048
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a game house is what's at... Just do a search for Tapa Jam.

2406
02:52:13,768 --> 02:52:17,189
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like... Oh my god, beatbox bonus feature!

2407
02:52:17,330 --> 02:52:18,410
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't see this before!

2408
02:52:18,450 --> 02:52:19,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, a beatbox bonus feature, huh?

2409
02:52:21,532 --> 02:52:23,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's... Just go to the game.

2410
02:52:25,013 --> 02:52:26,414
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a music generator, just gay.

2411
02:52:32,393 --> 02:52:34,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so he's going to play this.

2412
02:52:37,818 --> 02:52:40,501
[SPEAKER_09]: And it even has a little wavelength in the bottom of the screen.

2413
02:52:40,561 --> 02:52:43,283
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's like instead of pretty videos, you get waves like Winamp.

2414
02:52:45,045 --> 02:52:46,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Listen to Loki make that sweet music.

2415
02:52:47,006 --> 02:52:51,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2416
02:53:00,422 --> 02:53:01,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Aren't you happy?

2417
02:53:01,303 --> 02:53:08,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Doesn't this game make you just go in that base?

2418
02:53:09,069 --> 02:53:10,310
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like breaking down.

2419
02:53:10,370 --> 02:53:10,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.

2420
02:53:12,512 --> 02:53:13,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, your thoughts?

2421
02:53:20,999 --> 02:53:23,121
[SPEAKER_22]: This is shit.

2422
02:53:24,642 --> 02:53:25,643
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, combo.

2423
02:53:25,703 --> 02:53:26,364
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh my god.

2424
02:53:34,248 --> 02:53:37,750
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is an interesting way to get around having to license any song.

2425
02:53:38,070 --> 02:53:40,071
[SPEAKER_09]: They just put in a bunch of classical songs.

2426
02:53:42,032 --> 02:53:42,873
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a pretty smart idea.

2427
02:53:42,893 --> 02:53:44,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, we like our classical songs, don't we?

2428
02:53:45,294 --> 02:53:50,037
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think we like our classical songs better when the renditions don't suck ass.

2429
02:53:51,545 --> 02:53:56,828
[SPEAKER_09]: when they're played by an orchestra and not some $2 Casio keyboard from Walmart.

2430
02:54:03,151 --> 02:54:07,934
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you've ever wanted to play Beatmania in the comfort of your own home, go buy a Beatmania machine.

2431
02:54:07,954 --> 02:54:09,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Do not settle for this shit.

2432
02:54:11,195 --> 02:54:13,196
[SPEAKER_06]: This is sort of like a guitar freak show.

2433
02:54:14,137 --> 02:54:15,958
Oh, Loki failed Chopsticks!

2434
02:54:16,716 --> 02:54:21,699
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because I'm running the camera software, it's like, the notes are on one side of the screen, and I was like, jump.

2435
02:54:21,919 --> 02:54:25,762
[SPEAKER_09]: If you thought Night Style had bad lag, try playing Tapper Jam with the camera.

2436
02:54:27,963 --> 02:54:30,004
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyways, yeah, this game sucks.

2437
02:54:30,625 --> 02:54:31,525
[SPEAKER_09]: But isn't this interesting?

2438
02:54:31,545 --> 02:54:34,187
[SPEAKER_09]: This ties into what we were talking about last week.

2439
02:54:34,227 --> 02:54:40,451
[SPEAKER_09]: We were talking about, you know, oh, this Into the Groove thing is going to get its pantsuit off it because it's copying Konami.

2440
02:54:41,064 --> 02:54:45,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Well shit, this is a blatant ripoff of Beatmania if I've ever seen one.

2441
02:54:45,568 --> 02:54:49,612
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they've differed it enough, but it's still, it's shit.

2442
02:54:50,593 --> 02:54:51,954
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not even a good ripoff.

2443
02:54:52,955 --> 02:54:54,096
[SPEAKER_09]: This sounds like shit.

2444
02:54:54,116 --> 02:54:56,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop broadcasting this shit on the radio.

2445
02:54:57,039 --> 02:54:58,881
[SPEAKER_09]: We have little enough listeners as it is.

2446
02:54:59,721 --> 02:55:00,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, fine.

2447
02:55:02,659 --> 02:55:04,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I only get seven more sessions.

2448
02:55:05,320 --> 02:55:06,421
[SPEAKER_08]: They only limit me to ten.

2449
02:55:06,561 --> 02:55:08,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm going to go be violent.

2450
02:55:08,282 --> 02:55:09,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's at GameHouse.com.

2451
02:55:09,843 --> 02:55:10,863
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where you can find it at.

2452
02:55:11,964 --> 02:55:13,204
[SPEAKER_09]: And what other games do they have?

2453
02:55:13,764 --> 02:55:15,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody posted a link in our chat room.

2454
02:55:15,865 --> 02:55:17,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Tiger posted that for you guys.

2455
02:55:18,207 --> 02:55:18,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, lame.

2456
02:55:26,220 --> 02:55:37,103
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what happens when people start making... This is what, if they have problems licensing music, if we're into the groove, this is what it's going to be like.

2457
02:55:37,123 --> 02:55:43,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we're going to have MIDI-sounding classical pieces, and we'll get to dance to Chopsticks and the Big Anub.

2458
02:55:44,144 --> 02:55:46,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Play the one song real quick that I... What song?

2459
02:55:46,465 --> 02:55:47,265
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Utopia.

2460
02:55:47,305 --> 02:55:49,226
[SPEAKER_08]: This is one of the songs that's going to be into the group.

2461
02:55:49,446 --> 02:55:50,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, go for it.

2462
02:55:50,207 --> 02:55:52,668
[SPEAKER_08]: And I didn't really like it that much, but, you know.

2463
02:55:52,708 --> 02:55:54,769
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we'll let our listeners judge for themselves.

2464
02:55:55,209 --> 02:55:58,370
[SPEAKER_09]: This is by Ka, which is Gil's new name, if I'm not mistaken.

2465
02:55:58,791 --> 02:56:01,512
[SPEAKER_08]: And Smiley is the name that he's under for this one.

2466
02:56:01,532 --> 02:56:02,912
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, he's doing the Naoki thing.

2467
02:56:03,113 --> 02:56:03,613
[SPEAKER_08]: How cute.

2468
02:56:04,053 --> 02:56:05,494
[SPEAKER_08]: And, well, here it is.

2469
02:56:05,574 --> 02:56:06,574
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, judge for yourself.

2470
02:56:06,614 --> 02:56:07,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's Utopia from into the group.

2471
02:56:09,495 --> 02:56:10,756
[SPEAKER_09]: I always think of the Madonna song.

2472
02:56:10,816 --> 02:56:12,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, come on.

2473
02:56:13,017 --> 02:56:14,978
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't get away from being Madonna-ish.

2474
02:58:16,519 --> 02:58:21,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, okay, that was Utopia by Ka, Smiley, Keel, whatever the name is.

2475
02:58:21,260 --> 02:58:23,581
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a song that's going to be an into the groove.

2476
02:58:24,841 --> 02:58:25,701
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys' thoughts?

2477
02:58:25,801 --> 02:58:29,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, I know you already said you didn't like it, so I thought we'd see Jamie's thoughts.

2478
02:58:30,022 --> 02:58:34,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie's curled up in a little ball going to sleep, so you don't think you'd want to dance to that one, Jamie?

2479
02:58:36,684 --> 02:58:37,724
[SPEAKER_22]: No, not much.

2480
02:58:40,848 --> 02:58:43,371
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you guys are being a little hard on it.

2481
02:58:43,411 --> 02:58:44,573
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a good song.

2482
02:58:44,753 --> 02:58:47,957
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem is, okay, it's a good song, but...

2483
02:58:48,619 --> 02:58:50,560
[SPEAKER_09]: It's badly produced.

2484
02:58:51,960 --> 02:58:58,023
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not blaming the author for this because I think he's very talented and he's writing good music.

2485
02:58:58,343 --> 02:59:03,985
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he's just probably very limited in what he's able to write because he probably only has so much equipment, you know, whatever.

2486
02:59:04,305 --> 02:59:09,607
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think with an actual recording studio, if this guy worked for Konami, I think the song would be sweet.

2487
02:59:09,927 --> 02:59:12,248
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would have the better sampling.

2488
02:59:12,488 --> 02:59:16,830
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you were exactly right when you said it sounds like a MIDI.

2489
02:59:17,410 --> 02:59:20,113
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the sampling he's using is not good.

2490
02:59:20,454 --> 02:59:21,635
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of a poor choice.

2491
02:59:21,675 --> 02:59:24,318
[SPEAKER_09]: The piano sounds a little too MIDI-ish to me.

2492
02:59:25,339 --> 02:59:28,102
[SPEAKER_09]: I think if he had the right equipment, it would be a kick-ass song.

2493
02:59:28,122 --> 02:59:30,764
[SPEAKER_09]: I think if it were better produced, basically, is what it is.

2494
02:59:30,804 --> 02:59:32,266
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a good song, badly produced.

2495
02:59:34,002 --> 02:59:35,983
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't think that it suits a dancing game.

2496
02:59:36,063 --> 02:59:38,443
[SPEAKER_06]: It just doesn't seem like something I would enjoy playing.

2497
02:59:39,404 --> 02:59:40,004
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good song.

2498
02:59:40,344 --> 02:59:41,604
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't think I'd enjoy playing it.

2499
02:59:42,745 --> 02:59:45,845
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually, I almost see it more as like a 2DX song, in a way.

2500
02:59:46,165 --> 02:59:52,287
[SPEAKER_09]: I think if it were more... It's funny you should mention that, because it's like a 12-footer in this damn game, so the steps are like 2DX.

2501
02:59:52,307 --> 02:59:53,728
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

2502
02:59:53,768 --> 02:59:58,369
[SPEAKER_09]: See, that's just going to ruin the song even more, to throw it away on these 12-footers and stuff.

2503
02:59:59,129 --> 03:00:01,870
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's just... It's stupid.

2504
03:00:03,991 --> 03:00:05,051
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no need for it.

2505
03:00:05,111 --> 03:00:05,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.

2506
03:00:07,052 --> 03:00:10,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't you have a couple 11-footers to kill people?

2507
03:00:10,853 --> 03:00:12,093
[SPEAKER_09]: But stick to fun steps.

2508
03:00:12,113 --> 03:00:13,573
[SPEAKER_09]: That song could have some fun steps.

2509
03:00:13,613 --> 03:00:14,994
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that song could have some really fun steps.

2510
03:00:15,014 --> 03:00:22,935
[SPEAKER_08]: What they were saying is they have a maniac level or whatever, and already 10 of the songs have 11 and 12-footer steps.

2511
03:00:23,055 --> 03:00:29,217
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the problem is people think that the way they can squeeze more life out of DDR is to make it harder.

2512
03:00:29,992 --> 03:00:32,914
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just kind of like, you know what, the human body is going to reach a point.

2513
03:00:33,135 --> 03:00:35,877
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a point where it's just not going to be fun for the rest of us anymore.

2514
03:00:35,917 --> 03:00:41,581
[SPEAKER_09]: You're making the game to satisfy the 1% of people who could pass Max Period on the first try.

2515
03:00:42,042 --> 03:00:47,226
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, but in my eyes, Max Period is no fun at all.

2516
03:00:48,367 --> 03:00:50,969
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a bad DDR song because it's no fun at all.

2517
03:00:51,329 --> 03:00:54,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Speeding a song up to 600 beats per minute at the end, that's stupid.

2518
03:00:56,293 --> 03:00:58,174
[SPEAKER_09]: It's inhuman and undoable.

2519
03:00:58,635 --> 03:00:59,015
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just...

2520
03:01:00,967 --> 03:01:01,348
[SPEAKER_09]: It's too bad.

2521
03:01:02,289 --> 03:01:04,151
[SPEAKER_06]: And the song sucks.

2522
03:01:04,211 --> 03:01:05,012
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a big factor.

2523
03:01:06,454 --> 03:01:08,537
[SPEAKER_06]: If they're going to do hard ones, the song at least needs to be good.

2524
03:01:12,382 --> 03:01:12,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2525
03:01:13,463 --> 03:01:16,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, any other thoughts on this?

2526
03:01:19,969 --> 03:01:25,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other thoughts on Into the Groove, Tapajam, any other DDR knockoffs we need to address while we're here?

2527
03:01:27,874 --> 03:01:29,575
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just thinking that we can do it way better.

2528
03:01:29,935 --> 03:01:34,338
[SPEAKER_08]: And like I said, I'm going to take my attempt at it, so we'll work on it.

2529
03:01:34,518 --> 03:01:40,802
[SPEAKER_08]: As I said last week, I'm going to try pushing that and seeing if an arcade will take my idea.

2530
03:01:40,962 --> 03:01:45,585
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just saying, you could do it a lot better than what you're doing right now.

2531
03:01:46,773 --> 03:01:47,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

2532
03:01:47,774 --> 03:01:48,234
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's fine.

2533
03:01:49,515 --> 03:01:56,421
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I understand that they have their, you know, limitations with going the legal route, but, you know, a lot of people don't care about the legal route.

2534
03:01:56,441 --> 03:02:00,844
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why the DVR machines are here, so... That's the way you gotta look at it.

2535
03:02:04,227 --> 03:02:09,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Joe Mama wanted to make a point, kind of defending Max's period a little bit, I guess, or whatever, playing Devil's Advocate.

2536
03:02:09,973 --> 03:02:15,398
[SPEAKER_09]: How many people play Max 300 on 2-speed, he says, because that's just as bad as 600 beats per minute.

2537
03:02:16,119 --> 03:02:18,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, I've seen one or two.

2538
03:02:18,622 --> 03:02:20,864
[SPEAKER_09]: I've not seen that many people that brave it on 2-speed.

2539
03:02:20,984 --> 03:02:23,767
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, some people do it for the challenge.

2540
03:02:24,407 --> 03:02:28,689
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't really see it as something practical.

2541
03:02:29,129 --> 03:02:31,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Most people that do it on 2-speed honestly haven't memorized.

2542
03:02:31,810 --> 03:02:32,770
[SPEAKER_09]: They've played it so goddamn hard.

2543
03:02:32,790 --> 03:02:35,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the thing is, people don't like BPM-doubled songs.

2544
03:02:35,991 --> 03:02:40,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Songs that, you know, the steps are going quite... Yeah, because honestly, max 300 is only supposed to be 150 beats per minute.

2545
03:02:40,673 --> 03:02:42,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, we understand that, and same with Dropout.

2546
03:02:42,993 --> 03:02:52,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Dropout's the same way, and I understand they go with the bass line on it, and they do, you know, the bass line goes in eighth notes or whatever for max period, not one point, and that's why it goes 600.

2547
03:02:54,017 --> 03:02:59,584
[SPEAKER_08]: But the only reason, the steps for Max period aren't that hard, it's just so hard to read.

2548
03:02:59,784 --> 03:03:00,565
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just stupid.

2549
03:03:01,486 --> 03:03:04,289
[SPEAKER_08]: And the steps in the beginning are stupid too, because it's just jumping.

2550
03:03:04,690 --> 03:03:05,631
[SPEAKER_08]: It's tons of jumping.

2551
03:03:06,625 --> 03:03:07,325
[SPEAKER_08]: No one likes that.

2552
03:03:07,405 --> 03:03:08,126
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just retarded.

2553
03:03:08,286 --> 03:03:08,826
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true.

2554
03:03:09,286 --> 03:03:13,048
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of stepfiles in Tournament XIV got reamed for that.

2555
03:03:13,648 --> 03:03:13,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?

2556
03:03:13,988 --> 03:03:15,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Too many weird jokes and stuff.

2557
03:03:16,089 --> 03:03:18,510
[SPEAKER_08]: If that were a stepfile in Tournament XIV, they would be bitching.

2558
03:03:18,530 --> 03:03:22,272
[SPEAKER_08]: It wouldn't have even made it into the final.

2559
03:03:22,332 --> 03:03:26,593
[SPEAKER_08]: It would just be laughed off as, like, first off, being a horrible Max remix.

2560
03:03:27,194 --> 03:03:31,175
[SPEAKER_08]: And two, they would have been like, oh, well, this is the stepfile for it.

2561
03:03:31,195 --> 03:03:31,576
[SPEAKER_08]: It's stupid.

2562
03:03:31,596 --> 03:03:33,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Why did you double the BPM at the very end?

2563
03:03:33,716 --> 03:03:34,597
[SPEAKER_08]: That's retarded.

2564
03:03:35,297 --> 03:03:36,517
[SPEAKER_08]: They would have laughed at that thing.

2565
03:03:36,938 --> 03:03:40,498
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know why they did that.

2566
03:03:41,539 --> 03:03:44,740
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really think they know what they're doing as far as sim files go.

2567
03:03:45,160 --> 03:03:47,160
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think they know what they're doing.

2568
03:03:47,200 --> 03:03:50,201
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think they know what their customers want.

2569
03:03:50,901 --> 03:03:59,384
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they're looking at sim files, unfortunately looking at really shitty ones, and they're like, well, people like this, so this is what they're doing.

2570
03:03:59,744 --> 03:04:00,944
[SPEAKER_08]: It just doesn't make any sense.

2571
03:04:03,536 --> 03:04:09,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I guess at this point now, we'll open it up for final thoughts of the evening, because that's about it.

2572
03:04:09,718 --> 03:04:19,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I did want to say though, Jamie, have a safe trip, fly safe, have fun in Alabama, have twice as much fun for me, three times as much, see, Loki's covered too, because California's going to suck.

2573
03:04:21,149 --> 03:04:23,010
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, it'll suck until I get back.

2574
03:04:24,250 --> 03:04:25,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I'll have a good time.

2575
03:04:26,231 --> 03:04:27,552
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm going to see my family.

2576
03:04:28,052 --> 03:04:31,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope they don't drive me completely insane by the time I get back.

2577
03:04:32,494 --> 03:04:36,416
[SPEAKER_06]: But, and I'm going to have, I'm going to have Ma and Chad with me.

2578
03:04:37,837 --> 03:04:40,738
[SPEAKER_06]: So, flying sort of parallel flights.

2579
03:04:41,719 --> 03:04:44,020
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we're going to have lots of hanging out time.

2580
03:04:46,061 --> 03:04:47,822
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it's a girls trip out to Alabama.

2581
03:04:47,842 --> 03:04:48,382
[SPEAKER_09]: That should be fun.

2582
03:04:49,085 --> 03:04:50,426
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, final thoughts of the evening.

2583
03:04:50,926 --> 03:04:54,427
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just thinking, kind of a question to pose to the chat room.

2584
03:04:54,447 --> 03:04:54,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

2585
03:04:56,308 --> 03:05:07,873
[SPEAKER_08]: If you were to, like, say, go to your normal arcade, you've got, like, you know, your DVR Extreme has been there forever, and say it was upgraded with something that was homemade, but not necessarily, like, you know, into the group where it's its own things.

2586
03:05:08,013 --> 03:05:13,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, say someone put Step Mania on there and put, like, a bunch of, like, you know, the old tracks and some of the new tracks.

2587
03:05:14,176 --> 03:05:18,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you be that, like, against it if it was, like, a pretty decent collection of songs?

2588
03:05:19,579 --> 03:05:24,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you going to be all pissed off that it's just, you know, it's an independent software and not an official Konami thing?

2589
03:05:25,102 --> 03:05:28,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Or are you just going to be like, you know, hey, this is cool?

2590
03:05:28,884 --> 03:05:30,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's what I'm getting at.

2591
03:05:30,966 --> 03:05:36,549
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just trying to see if people would be so pissed off at having, like, a well put together set of songs.

2592
03:05:37,350 --> 03:05:38,492
[SPEAKER_08]: But not official.

2593
03:05:38,832 --> 03:05:40,895
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, because this is into the group stuff.

2594
03:05:40,935 --> 03:05:45,540
[SPEAKER_08]: If it was a well put together set of songs, it might be alright, but I don't know.

2595
03:05:46,181 --> 03:05:49,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a little question to throw around there and discuss.

2596
03:05:50,406 --> 03:05:50,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well.

2597
03:05:51,539 --> 03:05:56,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go around and get final thoughts, and we'll see if there's any answers to that when we get back.

2598
03:05:56,124 --> 03:05:58,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody wanted to share their final thought with us.

2599
03:05:58,787 --> 03:06:08,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody who's going by the nickname of Skywhore, thank you, thanks, that's great, says their final thought is that 2DX has met its match with Tapajam.

2600
03:06:10,118 --> 03:06:11,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Have another bud, buddy.

2601
03:06:14,352 --> 03:06:16,134
[SPEAKER_09]: A. You're my whore for Christ's sake.

2602
03:06:17,515 --> 03:06:19,336
[SPEAKER_08]: B. No.

2603
03:06:19,676 --> 03:06:27,202
[SPEAKER_08]: 2DX has met its match with the... I would love to see a mix of songs, like to do just kind of like an independent thing.

2604
03:06:27,542 --> 03:06:30,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Have the artists from 2DX and have like some of the homebrew artists.

2605
03:06:33,246 --> 03:06:38,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Have some of the homebrew artists fight against each other, like kind of a DJ battle type thing.

2606
03:06:38,909 --> 03:06:44,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there's a lot of homebrew artists out there that make really kick-ass songs and animations that go with them.

2607
03:06:45,292 --> 03:06:47,493
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2608
03:06:47,814 --> 03:06:52,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm looking to see in the chat room if there's any response to your hypothetical question to them, and there is not.

2609
03:06:52,496 --> 03:06:53,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody cares.

2610
03:06:53,336 --> 03:06:54,957
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess it's time to end the show.

2611
03:06:55,597 --> 03:06:56,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki, your final thought?

2612
03:06:57,644 --> 03:07:04,007
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is I better get working on my show this week so I don't have to do it the same day as I usually do.

2613
03:07:04,128 --> 03:07:04,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Tune in what day?

2614
03:07:05,288 --> 03:07:05,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Wednesday.

2615
03:07:05,969 --> 03:07:06,389
[SPEAKER_08]: What time?

2616
03:07:06,949 --> 03:07:07,609
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be at 7.

2617
03:07:08,830 --> 03:07:09,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.

2618
03:07:09,750 --> 03:07:10,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie, your final thought?

2619
03:07:14,589 --> 03:07:17,610
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to get up at 4 in the fucking morning.

2620
03:07:18,431 --> 03:07:19,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry, final thought.

2621
03:07:21,032 --> 03:07:28,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't forget, my show's going to be on Monday, and Tuesday I'm going to be on a plane, so just hope that I don't die or something.

2622
03:07:29,176 --> 03:07:29,716
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's it.

2623
03:07:31,377 --> 03:07:32,938
I don't miss you all!

2624
03:07:34,218 --> 03:07:39,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, my final thought is, um, I have nothing more to say.

2625
03:07:39,921 --> 03:07:40,301
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it.

2626
03:07:43,720 --> 03:07:48,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, you're going to have to word tonight because I know you enjoy always getting the word and you're going to be gone for a couple weeks, so here you go.

2627
03:07:50,784 --> 03:07:51,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

2628
03:07:53,606 --> 03:07:56,007
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2629
03:07:56,467 --> 03:08:00,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

2630
03:08:00,750 --> 03:08:02,591
[SPEAKER_07]: We expect you a nice play again.

2631
03:08:03,091 --> 03:08:05,852
[SPEAKER_07]: And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2632
03:08:06,413 --> 03:08:09,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I object to all this sex on the television.

2633
03:08:10,135 --> 03:08:12,036
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I keep falling off.

2634
03:08:12,816 --> 03:08:14,917
[SPEAKER_09]: thanks for listening and we'll see you next week

2635
03:08:48,095 --> 03:08:56,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio, The Afterbirth, the part after the credits have crawled across the screen, and everything you think has come to an end, but it's still going.

2636
03:08:57,380 --> 03:09:00,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, you did finally get some feedback to your hypothetical situation you posed.

2637
03:09:00,922 --> 03:09:01,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2638
03:09:02,703 --> 03:09:07,725
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, Zodiac Knight says, I think the potential for any DDR homebrew lies in the song selection.

2639
03:09:08,546 --> 03:09:08,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2640
03:09:09,566 --> 03:09:09,967
[SPEAKER_12]: Sounds good.

2641
03:09:12,588 --> 03:09:15,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Zodiac Knight also says, I would take a look at it at least.

2642
03:09:15,810 --> 03:09:16,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Give it a try.

2643
03:09:17,153 --> 03:09:34,902
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing I'm concerned about is I want to do this, and I think we might have the potential to actually put it in the arcade, but I'm thinking people are going to go and see it, and they're going to go on DDR free and go, oh my god, I saw this in the arcade, and people are getting pissed off, and I'm bitching about that.

2644
03:09:35,522 --> 03:09:40,305
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of ironic that the people that like the game so much would actually ruin it for themselves.

2645
03:09:42,206 --> 03:09:44,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting thought.

2646
03:09:44,407 --> 03:09:48,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Pixie Dust says, I suck at DDR, but I'd still try it.

2647
03:09:49,509 --> 03:09:49,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2648
03:09:50,330 --> 03:09:54,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, like I said... So I think everybody's kind of like, okay, I'll try it.

2649
03:09:54,552 --> 03:09:55,232
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll try it once.

2650
03:09:55,613 --> 03:09:57,053
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll try it once, twice if I like it.

2651
03:09:58,174 --> 03:09:58,814
Three times to be sure.

2652
03:09:59,135 --> 03:10:00,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Three times to be sure, exactly.

2653
03:10:00,896 --> 03:10:01,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2654
03:10:01,216 --> 03:10:04,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if they had good music, then I suppose it would take off and work.

2655
03:10:04,377 --> 03:10:05,818
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what I'll have to work on.

2656
03:10:05,838 --> 03:10:07,939
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll have to work on it.

2657
03:10:07,979 --> 03:10:09,440
[SPEAKER_06]: You should use my evil edits.

2658
03:10:09,981 --> 03:10:13,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Nostylan says he's going to miss you, Jamie.

2659
03:10:13,923 --> 03:10:16,144
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's going to miss Pump Up the Volume as well.

2660
03:10:16,644 --> 03:10:17,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it'll still be playing.

2661
03:10:17,785 --> 03:10:18,865
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll get to hear some of the old ones.

2662
03:10:19,586 --> 03:10:26,890
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, maybe the Tuesday night I get back, if I'm not, like, dead to the world, I'll toss on some Eurobeat for you.

2663
03:10:28,174 --> 03:10:30,355
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a couple things I was going to be planning.

2664
03:10:31,916 --> 03:10:34,117
[SPEAKER_08]: LiveWire for the 19th of November.

2665
03:10:34,137 --> 03:10:36,058
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to have to do something special for that.

2666
03:10:37,059 --> 03:10:38,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Some Bomani-related thing.

2667
03:10:39,240 --> 03:10:42,802
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, what was it?

2668
03:10:44,123 --> 03:10:48,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I think, I don't know, might try to do something special for New Year's.

2669
03:10:49,206 --> 03:10:50,846
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, depending on what I'm doing.

2670
03:10:52,687 --> 03:10:53,988
[SPEAKER_08]: We should do something on New Year's.

2671
03:10:54,348 --> 03:10:55,269
[SPEAKER_08]: What day is New Year's?

2672
03:10:56,170 --> 03:10:58,272
[SPEAKER_06]: I do something every New Year's though.

2673
03:10:58,792 --> 03:11:03,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm thinking if anything runs on New Year's it's going to be taped because I don't want to be here.

2674
03:11:03,475 --> 03:11:06,697
[SPEAKER_06]: We always do an anime marathon and get really drunk.

2675
03:11:06,958 --> 03:11:12,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm thinking I want to go out and get wasted because I didn't get to do it for Halloween so I'm going to be doing it for New Year's.

2676
03:11:13,822 --> 03:11:15,283
[SPEAKER_10]: You can come get wasted with me, Loki.

2677
03:11:16,144 --> 03:11:16,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on.

2678
03:11:17,245 --> 03:11:18,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Drunk Rob is awesome, isn't it?

2679
03:11:20,067 --> 03:11:24,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Drunk Rob is funny, Mr. Piñata.

2680
03:11:26,303 --> 03:11:29,006
[SPEAKER_09]: I got called by somebody drunk last night three times.

2681
03:11:29,186 --> 03:11:33,089
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't embarrass them on the air by saying who it is, but it was really funny.

2682
03:11:34,270 --> 03:11:34,851
[SPEAKER_09]: It was great.

2683
03:11:34,971 --> 03:11:36,492
[SPEAKER_09]: And he called today to apologize.

2684
03:11:36,572 --> 03:11:37,633
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, you don't have to apologize.

2685
03:11:37,653 --> 03:11:38,114
[SPEAKER_09]: You're funny.

2686
03:11:38,734 --> 03:11:39,195
[SPEAKER_09]: This is cool.

2687
03:11:40,676 --> 03:11:41,657
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it was funny.

2688
03:11:42,918 --> 03:11:43,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Drunk people are hilarious.

2689
03:11:44,740 --> 03:11:45,361
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

2690
03:11:45,601 --> 03:11:45,821
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2691
03:11:48,784 --> 03:11:50,085
[SPEAKER_06]: You've seen me get drunk.

2692
03:11:50,816 --> 03:11:54,177
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't think I'm funny when I'm drunk, because it doesn't last.

2693
03:11:54,237 --> 03:11:55,717
[SPEAKER_09]: You've been funny when you're drunk.

2694
03:11:56,658 --> 03:11:59,098
[SPEAKER_09]: How?

2695
03:11:59,618 --> 03:12:01,279
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen you be funny when you're drunk.

2696
03:12:02,059 --> 03:12:05,220
[SPEAKER_06]: I go around giving other people drinks because I want them to be as drunk as me.

2697
03:12:06,080 --> 03:12:10,361
[SPEAKER_09]: People are calling on the phone, not realizing we're trying to do a show in this house.

2698
03:12:13,242 --> 03:12:17,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, he's doing a radio show.

2699
03:12:18,824 --> 03:12:20,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's the goober that called?

2700
03:12:21,963 --> 03:12:23,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I can have him call you.

2701
03:12:24,768 --> 03:12:25,409
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, bye.

2702
03:12:26,771 --> 03:12:28,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Who was the goober that called?

2703
03:12:28,494 --> 03:12:30,278
[SPEAKER_08]: That was Matt, so you can yell at him.

2704
03:12:30,318 --> 03:12:30,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Goober!

2705
03:12:30,839 --> 03:12:32,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you're still doing that?

2706
03:12:33,163 --> 03:12:34,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we are.

2707
03:12:35,200 --> 03:12:35,801
[SPEAKER_09]: www.DarkSakura.com

2708
03:12:55,978 --> 03:12:59,400
[SPEAKER_09]: But the way we've been counting, 69 is coming up in a couple weeks.

2709
03:12:59,420 --> 03:13:00,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Those were half episodes.

2710
03:13:00,541 --> 03:13:01,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2711
03:13:02,162 --> 03:13:03,402
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so weird, you guys.

2712
03:13:04,783 --> 03:13:06,684
[SPEAKER_09]: I can remember back to the first episode.

2713
03:13:06,904 --> 03:13:09,405
[SPEAKER_06]: When we hit 100, we need to be really, really quick.

2714
03:13:09,425 --> 03:13:11,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I already said when we hit 100, I'm quitting.

2715
03:13:11,687 --> 03:13:13,228
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we're not going to quit.

2716
03:13:13,948 --> 03:13:15,229
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to keep going.

2717
03:13:15,749 --> 03:13:16,669
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we'll keep going.

2718
03:13:16,749 --> 03:13:19,371
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to be geriatric.

2719
03:13:19,411 --> 03:13:20,832
[SPEAKER_09]: PC Dust wants to take me to L.A.

2720
03:13:20,892 --> 03:13:22,392
[SPEAKER_09]: for New Year's.

2721
03:13:22,453 --> 03:13:23,133
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm down with that.

2722
03:13:24,577 --> 03:13:27,000
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to go far away for New Year's.

2723
03:13:27,140 --> 03:13:27,821
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to travel.

2724
03:13:28,081 --> 03:13:29,303
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to have money and travel.

2725
03:13:29,363 --> 03:13:30,084
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'm going to do.

2726
03:13:30,204 --> 03:13:33,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but I want a cookie, but I can't have that.

2727
03:13:35,603 --> 03:13:35,923
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2728
03:13:36,604 --> 03:13:42,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Your post-show tonight is going to be a recycled pre-show, one of Jamie's old pre-shows, and it's one I like.

2729
03:13:42,887 --> 03:13:44,968
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've decided that that's going to be tonight's post-show.

2730
03:13:44,988 --> 03:13:46,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and which one, pray tell.

2731
03:13:46,509 --> 03:13:48,950
[SPEAKER_09]: It is the one with all the Svensson and Ghislaine mixes.

2732
03:13:49,310 --> 03:13:50,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that one was fun.

2733
03:13:50,391 --> 03:13:50,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it was.

2734
03:13:51,491 --> 03:13:54,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wait, now I'm curious.

2735
03:13:54,413 --> 03:13:58,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, before I get into the post-show, somebody says, Joe Mama says, the first episodes were fun.

2736
03:14:00,556 --> 03:14:02,157
[SPEAKER_09]: Did we jump the shark or something?

2737
03:14:02,197 --> 03:14:03,898
[SPEAKER_09]: What's wrong with the recent episodes?

2738
03:14:04,810 --> 03:14:09,373
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is like a fine wine we've improved with age.

2739
03:14:10,293 --> 03:14:13,415
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I've been noticing that... Or like a mold's gotten bigger.

2740
03:14:13,595 --> 03:14:14,956
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been less bitter lately.

2741
03:14:14,976 --> 03:14:19,819
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like, I get to Sunday and I'm already relaxed.

2742
03:14:19,839 --> 03:14:23,781
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be angry all throughout the week and then I just kind of calm down on the weekend.

2743
03:14:24,782 --> 03:14:29,424
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not because I'm getting laid more or anything, it's just because... I don't know, it's just calming.

2744
03:14:29,785 --> 03:14:32,026
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the only one not getting laid, I should be the bitter one.

2745
03:14:33,288 --> 03:14:38,150
[SPEAKER_09]: But even when I wasn't, I was, I mean, even when I was, I was still getting, I was still bitter.

2746
03:14:38,250 --> 03:14:43,752
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like, I think I don't go out enough and get, like, people pissing me off enough.

2747
03:14:43,812 --> 03:14:47,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Or it's the same people pissing me off, so it's like, eh, been there.

2748
03:14:47,893 --> 03:14:51,395
[SPEAKER_09]: So, has Orange Lounge Radio jumped the shark yet, you think?

2749
03:14:51,435 --> 03:14:52,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Or you think we still got a ways to go?

2750
03:14:52,955 --> 03:14:57,397
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but I'm very scared to think of 23 Magus with a man's slut.

2751
03:14:58,988 --> 03:14:59,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Well now.

2752
03:15:01,549 --> 03:15:02,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I see.

2753
03:15:02,270 --> 03:15:06,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Joe Mama is thinking back to those days when only like six people frequented our chat room during the shows.

2754
03:15:07,012 --> 03:15:09,233
[SPEAKER_06]: And we just didn't give a fuck.

2755
03:15:09,273 --> 03:15:09,834
[SPEAKER_06]: And guess what?

2756
03:15:09,874 --> 03:15:12,495
[SPEAKER_09]: You still don't give a fuck.

2757
03:15:12,855 --> 03:15:16,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, the number of people has never been that important to us.

2758
03:15:16,317 --> 03:15:22,900
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, because obviously if we were numbers, we don't get that many people in retrospect to listen to the show.

2759
03:15:22,940 --> 03:15:24,441
[SPEAKER_09]: But in internet radio terms...

2760
03:15:25,245 --> 03:15:26,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Quite a few, actually.

2761
03:15:26,947 --> 03:15:30,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Quite a few for an internet radio show, which is very good.

2762
03:15:30,970 --> 03:15:31,570
[SPEAKER_09]: We are loved.

2763
03:15:32,391 --> 03:15:33,532
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have all you guys to thank.

2764
03:15:33,552 --> 03:15:34,553
[SPEAKER_09]: And it just keeps getting bigger.

2765
03:15:34,613 --> 03:15:36,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Every week I see new faces coming into the chatroom.

2766
03:15:36,635 --> 03:15:37,135
[SPEAKER_09]: It's awesome.

2767
03:15:39,037 --> 03:15:39,477
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

2768
03:15:40,918 --> 03:15:41,779
[SPEAKER_06]: And we love you guys.

2769
03:15:42,980 --> 03:15:44,782
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry that you haven't gotten laid.

2770
03:15:46,503 --> 03:15:47,664
[SPEAKER_08]: That's Pixie Dust.

2771
03:15:48,925 --> 03:15:49,245
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

2772
03:15:49,506 --> 03:15:50,947
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry that she hasn't gotten laid.

2773
03:15:52,785 --> 03:15:55,607
[SPEAKER_09]: You come over, pixie dust, I'll show you good times.

2774
03:15:55,807 --> 03:15:58,789
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, people... I'll show your boobs some lovin'.

2775
03:15:59,129 --> 03:16:01,490
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't need to get laid to be happy.

2776
03:16:01,931 --> 03:16:02,231
They don't.

2777
03:16:02,691 --> 03:16:05,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people are perfectly happy being asexual.

2778
03:16:05,453 --> 03:16:11,656
[SPEAKER_09]: But, but, but, getting laid definitely, like, takes the little, like, hyper dog out of you, you know?

2779
03:16:11,676 --> 03:16:15,419
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like... You know what this may be?

2780
03:16:15,479 --> 03:16:18,961
[SPEAKER_08]: And to be honest, I can think of a few people that could use a little mellowing.

2781
03:16:22,586 --> 03:16:23,927
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

2782
03:16:24,168 --> 03:16:24,788
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

2783
03:16:25,228 --> 03:16:28,090
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry that getting laid just does one thing for me.

2784
03:16:28,110 --> 03:16:29,031
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes me want ice cream.

2785
03:16:30,032 --> 03:16:30,452
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

2786
03:16:31,173 --> 03:16:31,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Just remember.

2787
03:16:32,534 --> 03:16:35,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, could I order vanilla cream with an orgasm mix-in?

2788
03:16:37,037 --> 03:16:38,859
[SPEAKER_06]: No, come back here and make your comment on there.

2789
03:16:38,899 --> 03:16:39,499
[SPEAKER_06]: That was great.

2790
03:16:39,719 --> 03:16:40,500
[SPEAKER_06]: That was brilliant.

2791
03:16:42,021 --> 03:16:45,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Just remember, without sex, Ben and Jerry's wouldn't be doing so well.

2792
03:16:48,359 --> 03:16:49,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Cream, anyone?

2793
03:16:52,101 --> 03:16:53,582
[SPEAKER_09]: What else am I thinking of here?

2794
03:16:53,602 --> 03:16:54,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Vanilla Chunk?

2795
03:16:57,044 --> 03:16:57,404
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2796
03:16:57,544 --> 03:16:59,905
[SPEAKER_09]: It had something to do with this show, but I guess it wasn't that bad.

2797
03:16:59,925 --> 03:17:00,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Trainwreck!

2798
03:17:00,645 --> 03:17:01,126
[SPEAKER_09]: I know what it is.

2799
03:17:01,186 --> 03:17:01,746
[SPEAKER_09]: I know what it is.

2800
03:17:01,786 --> 03:17:03,107
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it actually has nothing to do with this show.

2801
03:17:03,127 --> 03:17:05,428
[SPEAKER_09]: It has to do with getting laid, which is even better than this show.

2802
03:17:05,548 --> 03:17:07,369
[SPEAKER_22]: It has to do with this show.

2803
03:17:07,869 --> 03:17:08,369
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

2804
03:17:08,409 --> 03:17:10,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Some people don't need to get laid.

2805
03:17:11,171 --> 03:17:12,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Some people just want to cuddle.

2806
03:17:13,792 --> 03:17:13,892
[SPEAKER_22]: Aww.

2807
03:17:17,621 --> 03:17:24,386
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a funny line in Boondock Saints where they're talking about cuddling.

2808
03:17:24,746 --> 03:17:30,570
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the one cop who's the perfect investigator, and he's a gay guy, but he acts like a straight guy.

2809
03:17:30,610 --> 03:17:31,071
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of weird.

2810
03:17:31,131 --> 03:17:32,852
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like this guy's trying to cuddle with him.

2811
03:17:32,892 --> 03:17:33,993
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, what the fuck you want?

2812
03:17:34,033 --> 03:17:34,733
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to cuddle?

2813
03:17:35,154 --> 03:17:36,575
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, man, you're so gay.

2814
03:17:36,755 --> 03:17:38,096
[SPEAKER_08]: And then he gets up and walks away.

2815
03:17:39,076 --> 03:17:39,757
[SPEAKER_08]: That was funny.

2816
03:17:46,890 --> 03:17:56,158
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let's get it.

2817
03:17:56,178 --> 03:17:56,539
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2818
03:17:57,199 --> 03:17:58,981
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you've had your fill.

2819
03:17:59,281 --> 03:17:59,601
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2820
03:18:01,603 --> 03:18:02,124
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

2821
03:18:02,344 --> 03:18:04,126
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to go into post-show now.

2822
03:18:04,266 --> 03:18:05,747
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Spencer McGeehan music.

2823
03:18:06,668 --> 03:18:08,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Started off with a little bit of Ayumi Hamasaki, huh?

2824
03:18:09,648 --> 03:18:10,408
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll depend on you.

2825
03:18:10,449 --> 03:18:12,390
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't wait to mute these microphones.

2826
03:18:13,170 --> 03:18:14,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Say goodbye to the ferrets, Jamie.

2827
03:18:15,091 --> 03:18:16,612
[SPEAKER_04]: They're coming with me.

2828
03:18:17,152 --> 03:18:18,493
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't take them back.

2829
03:18:18,513 --> 03:18:19,734
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll never see.

2830
03:18:20,214 --> 03:18:20,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait.

2831
03:18:20,975 --> 03:18:25,517
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to take them back.

2832
03:18:25,637 --> 03:18:30,700
[SPEAKER_22]: If you ever leave, when that day comes, we'll be together from there.

2833
03:21:33,531 --> 03:21:35,573
Thank you for watching!

2834

Thanks for watching!

2835

[SPEAKER_22]: I want to die to the light of the ocean of love I want to die to the light of the ocean of love
