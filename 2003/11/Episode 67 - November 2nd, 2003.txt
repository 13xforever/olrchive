Rock over London, rock over Chicago, Orange Lounge Radio.
It's a good place to listen to the music.
Hello, everybody, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 67, now in progress.
So...
Jamie, tell me about... I'm going to go sit in the living room so I can show up on cam, because otherwise the cam's very boring.
If you want to... If you want to join us on cam, head on over to our chatroom, www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on chat.
And in the chatroom, by the way, chatroom is up on the television screen, so we can all see what you're saying.
I'm going to molest them.
It's interactive when you're in our chatroom.
Jamie, but first tell us, I want everybody to know about these games that you brought to the show tonight, because they're pretty cool.
I had to molest the chat room, sorry.
That's alright.
Well, I'll put them up on, the cam's updating, right?
Yeah, once in a while.
Well, you have to explain for those that aren't going to be on the cam.
I am an old school gaming freak.
I love old games.
Nothing wrong with that.
When Dan and I discovered that Sega was kind enough to...
Release updated versions of their older games.
We hopped right on it and grabbed our three favorites.
Right on.
Of course, one of them was backordered, so we're still waiting for a Phantasy Star collection.
No surprise there.
Well, actually, this is a remake of the first Phantasy Star.
If anyone ever played it on the Master System, you know what I'm talking about.
Right.
But they put out another two games that are probably about my second and third favorite game ever.
And what will be the first game ever?
Guardian Legend.
I seriously doubt that's ever going to get a release.
But the first one I'm putting up on cam right now is probably my other favorite game like ever.
And for those that can't see the cam.
I'm trying to get to where it'll adjust.
It's Fantasy Zone.
The game that brought us the Opa Opa.
Which is this cute little ship with angel wings.
With feet.
And when you're on the gun he has little legs.
and he's super cute.
See, there it is on the camera, Fantasy Zone.
And then the other awesome game... It's funny because the way you held it up, you still have Loki on part of the picture.
I didn't get it up there.
You have a very blurry picture of Space Harrier up there now.
Let me see.
This may be a little bit better.
Okay.
So Space Harrier being the other game, which is...
For those that may not recognize Space Harrier by name, because I didn't at first, I kind of had to get visuals of these games.
So let me kind of describe them for you.
Fantasy Zone is like this beautiful... It's sort of like Defender.
It's like Defender, but in beautiful, beautiful pastels.
And I never thought I'd... It's like happy music.
I never thought I'd refer to pastels as a beautiful thing, but Fantasy Zone really pulls it off.
It's like uber cute in the way it's painted.
It looks like a color by number.
And when you're watching, when you're looking at, you know, dead on, it looks like it's fully 2D, but they're really actually flat, self-shaded polygons.
That's kind of the point I wanted to get to about these re-releases, is that they didn't just... Now, it's not like a Namco Museum game or an Atari Museum game where they just took the old games, put them on a CD, and emulated them, basically.
No.
They took these games...
DarkSakura,
I wasn't like huge fans of them like Jamie was when they were first out, but I remember playing Fantasy Zone.
I ran it at one weekend.
I played it on the Nintendo where it looked like barf because the color palette isn't the same as it is on a Sega, so it looks all messed up.
And the reason why is that the Nintendo was not set up for pastel color, where the Master System was.
So I played them and they looked like barf, but coming back now and playing them again, I'm just like, oh my god, this is so beautiful.
Finally, we're using a next generation system to make our 2D games look even better.
It's so cool.
Dear 8-bit companies like Nintendo, anybody that was big in the 8-bit days, even Konami.
It would be nice to have Super Konami World Collection 3D.
Seriously, I want you all to take up this project.
Do your old 2D games in 3D like this, because they are so cool.
It's just, oh man.
Especially when you're going to release one of these old, kind of like old school game packs, and re-release it as like a new thing.
I just, oh, it's so beautiful.
Words can't express.
They also come with another little neat thing.
If you bought the special edition of Phantasy Star, which we actually didn't get, it came with a little binder.
And in the binder, you would put these cards in.
Oh, okay.
That are basically just description of the game, some of the history of it.
I'm putting the Winter Fantasy Zone up on the cam.
That's still kind of neat, though.
So... But they're also, they're bringing out more games.
The ones that are out right now in the series is there was, of course, Fantasy Star, Space Harrier, Fantasy Zone, Monaco GP...
Goldnax is pretty.
There's a site, actually if you go to the live journal community Girl Gamers and just look for my post, I put a big post there about it with a link to the Japanese site
where you can watch a streaming video of screens from the first five releases.
I'm thinking you need to make that a cross post to the Orange Lounge community.
I'll go look for my own post.
Good idea.
But the next ones that are coming out, and actually I didn't find this out until I looked for the pre-orders on Lixing, but the next one out is Columns.
and then the other one, I don't remember what it is.
It's a game that didn't come out over here.
I'll have to check out.
Oh my God.
Please tell me they're going to do Alex Kidd.
Wouldn't it be nice?
Yeah, Alex Kidd was a Sega game, wasn't it?
Yes, it was.
What would be really cool is if... And Shinobi?
Well, they did Shinobi.
Yeah, but okay, I'm not counting the new Shinobi.
You know what actually I think would be cool?
What?
and Michael Jackson Moonwalker.
Oh yeah.
What?
What?
Skywalker was kind of 3D to begin with.
It was one of those cheap, it was still a 2D game, but it was 3D.
It was like the Ninja Turtles where you can move up and down, but you know what?
Well, this is what I was thinking.
You know how in Sonic Adventure 2, how they had the bonus?
That was the remake of the Green Hill Zone from the first Sonic game.
Wouldn't it be cool if they took the original Sonic games and did them like that?
Absolutely.
And then, of course, this was just kind of brought up, I think this was brought up in the chat room, I think this is where I saw it, but my very favorite old school Sega game of all time, they badly need to do this port to, Altered Beast.
Rise from your grave.
I cannot wait for them to do Altered Beast like this.
This is...
Man, I'm just picturing, I'm kind of picturing, I'm going back to Castlevania, because for those who were listening to Vanilla Sky on Monday, we were talking about the new Castlevania, and kind of got into a discussion on like, you know, is Castlevania good, or what have you, because of the 3D-ness of it now.
I'm just thinking, oh my god.
And why would she play it in Japanese without the shitty US voice acting?
Oh my god, that's so much crap.
But I just go back and think, oh my god, what if Simon's Quest were done like this Fantasy Zone thing is?
I would have an orgasm.
Sega has always been really smart with their games.
They've just had, you know, bad advertising and, you know, going up against basically a major monopoly like, you know, Sony is.
You know, they say that they didn't have, you know, take from their other facilities, but you can tell they put major money behind the PlayStation, even though the Saturn to this day is still a better system.
The Dreamcast to this day has still had better games than many PS2s.
You will go to your grave, a Sega fangirl.
You know, I used to be a Nintendo fangirl, 100%.
And now, my whole support of Nintendo comes just because Sega's supporting them.
Isn't it so weird now to fire up a game like F-Zero and you see on the first screen, Sega Nintendo?
It's like, wow, ten years ago, you're picturing those ads in your mind, Sega does what Nintendo don't.
Well, you know what?
I remember on one of my tapes, one of my old tapes off Japanese TV, watching the monkeys, these two little monkeys playing TV.
And one of them was playing a Saturn, playing Burning Rangers on the Saturn, if this dates this for you.
And the other one was playing like some other game on, like an older crappy game on the PlayStation.
And the PlayStation monkey went to go play the Saturn.
I have to address something that came up in the chat room.
We have some new chatters tonight, so hello to all our new folks.
We love seeing some new faces in our chat room.
We have a guy named Bargle who says, is a little bit disgusted by the thought of me having an orgasm over a game.
You know what?
There is nothing better than an orgasm.
You name me one thing in this world that's better than an orgasm.
Two orgasms.
Two orgasms.
Thank you, Loki.
What?
Really good ice cream.
Maybe if you're a woman, but... If I was sitting between the best orgasm ever and a bowl of chocolate decadence blue belt ice cream.
Chocolate orgasm.
Ooh.
Although, and this may be TMI.
Did I give that a cold stone?
The best, actually the best, best thing ever is the bowl of ice cream you eat after an orgasm.
Is to go out
Fuck a bunch.
And then eat a bowl of ice cream.
For some, it's the cigarettes.
For some, it's the ice cream.
Hey, I don't smoke.
Next time I'm going to go into Cold Stone, I'm going to be all, yeah, could I get the, I'd like to get the vanilla cream with the orgasm mix in.
You know, we need to sit and create, call it the Orange Lounge Orgasm at Cold Stone.
and keep and like put the right number in it.
Oh, like write it in and stuff?
Well, they don't have those anymore.
What?
I was going to put mine in.
I used to have my cherry cheesecake flavor that I just called the DarkSakura.
How original.
Because it was, you know, it was graham cracker, brownie, cheesecake, and cherry pie filling.
It was so good and so bad for me.
I want ice cream now.
As good as that sounds, Jamie, orgasms are better.
Anyway... Ice cream after... I think we got off on a little bit of a tangent there.
Sorry, kids.
Hey!
That's what we do here on Orange Honor.
Welcome to the Fantasy Zone.
Get ready.
So, um... I was so happy because it's in there!
Does it actually have voice acting?
Well, yeah.
It's like... Okay, this is what happened.
I wish we could play it for the chat room, but we really can't.
Um, but, um... When you're, um... It's like, when you start off the game, it doesn't say the Welcome to the Fantasy Zone, get ready.
At least the first time it did it.
It's like... Like...
Get Ready, Harrier, or something like that.
I bet you were pissed.
And then go for it.
I bet you were pissed when you heard that.
Oh, I was.
And then, like, four games later, you know, watching Dan play it the other night, it finally said it.
And we were like, ah.
I remember when I first ever, like, saw your post back on DDR Freak.
I remember that was your signature, welcome to the Fantasy Zone, get ready.
And I always thought it was actually from Fantasy Zone.
Well, the thing is that Space Harrier is set in the same universe as Fantasy Zone.
I think a lot of people don't realize that.
I know you've mentioned that to me before.
If you look at the original games, Fantasy Zone has the big plaid floors and everything.
And then you have the checkered ground, and then the checkered ground is in Space Harrier, the originals.
and it's set in the same universe although they made it completely different for these two they look completely different so here's my final thought on the whole 8-bit games being redone Guardian Legend Remake Guardian Legend Remake Dear Broderbund and who else put that game out?
I don't remember Broderbund was the publisher of it please do a Guardian Legend Remake oh my god I would never leave the house ever it's done it would be more addicting you know there was there was a game that came out
Guardian Legend Online.
Oh, my God.
No, I don't know.
Guardian Legend is not a game to be played online.
Guardian Legend is a masturbatory game.
It's a solo experience.
You know what?
They need to freaking do it.
It's a solo orgasm.
You know what?
It was the original survival horror game.
I don't know if I'd call it a horror game
But you have to go find weapons, you know.
I mean, she was doing it before Snake ever did his thing.
It's the same thing, too.
It's tactical survival espionage horror shooting game.
I always, I don't know if I'd go as far to say that it was this new genre of game that was fabulous, but what it did is it took two genres of existing games, like Zelda and Gradius, to kind of name two, more like Life Force, maybe, but took these two games and brought them together.
It was about as hard as Life Force.
So beautifully.
It's just like going to a wedding and crying at the beautiful union of these two things.
And it had the little thingies from Adventure of Lolo.
What?
The blue thingies from Adventure of Lolo.
It did.
They've had the shots.
I don't think they were, I think they were supposed to be, they're related to the blue things from Zexys.
Z-E-Y-X-Z, that game, Zexys?
Yeah.
I think it's related to those blue guys, not the Lolo guy.
I think Lolo's a different blue guy.
So I was like, hey, the guys from Adventure Lolo left.
They're boycotting.
It was, and you know, it had really good music in it, too.
And I also knew the trick where you could walk through the divider walls in the center.
It's like if you held your controller at an angle, you could walk through the wall and get to the other side.
8-bit games are great.
And you know the other neat controller trick was the one for Mega Man 3?
I submitted the thing to Nintendo Power way back when.
Because I was the first person I knew of that found this little trick.
You know, everyone knew about the double jump.
In Mega Man 3, where you hold down your left and right and A button or something like that on the second controller.
Because I would put it on the floor and sit in a chair and hold it with my feet.
But if you fall down a hole and then you let go and then hit it again, you'll hear the die noise and then you can jump out of the hole.
And you have no life.
Really?
And you can use, the only way that you can shoot anything is to use your special weapons.
Because your shot is also your life.
But if you hit a power up, you know, a life refill, then you have to do the trick again.
But it's really convenient when you're going against a boss and they can't kill you because you're already dead.
So, that's, you know, I'm going off on a tangent right now.
Hooray for digression.
That's all right.
Alright, we need a topic change.
So you're going to be gone the next two weeks.
So what's going on?
For those that are just joining us tonight, because I know we have some new folks, what's going on?
Why are you going to be leaving us the next couple of weeks?
I'm going to see my family.
The fifth is my mama's birthday.
I'm very pissed off that this is going to go into the fuckies of the week because I can't buy my mom her Alan Jackson tickets because I can't afford them.
Awe.
Which I'm really not, you know, that upset about me missing Alan Jackson, but mom is really... Right.
And unless the credit card I signed up for arrives, I can't get her tickets.
Poopy.
So, you know, I'm going to take her out to eat.
I'm going to try to do something nice.
Um, but the general itinerary is spending time with my family, spending time with my mama-san and papa-san, who were really, really good friends of mine who took care of me when I needed some place to stay.
Um, going to my college and getting my transcripts, because, you know, technically I'm still enrolled at the University of South Alabama.
I technically, I'm still enrolled at a school in California, too.
Um, um,
Get a, have to get a SARS mask to go visit my mom's house because she and her husband both smoke.
And also have a dog.
What am I super allergic to?
Cigar smoking dog.
Didn't you, um, oh, I don't, um.
I smoked a while back.
Well, yeah, but.
But it was the cigars because I wasn't allergic to them.
But I think it's different.
Once you quit, like, it can... That was really stupid of me because I had asthma.
It can really affect you.
Honestly, and I know that probably some people who are listening smoke, I know that some people do every so often.
But I still think that's probably the most retarded thing anyone can do to themselves.
That, and it's also pretty...
and forgive me for saying so, this is how I feel about it.
It's also pretty inconsiderate of other people because you're poisoning their air.
If you think about it.
They have to breathe the smoke.
But that's another story.
And oh my god, I went to the casino and I thought I was going to die.
You went to the casino?
I went to Thunder Valley yesterday with Iguanago and Islander.
You know what's weird about that casino?
What?
No arcade.
I'm such a dork.
The first time the casino opened up, I'm like, ooh, maybe there'll be a cool DDR machine because that's just what an addict I am.
And no arcade to be found anywhere.
Where do the kids go when mommy and daddy go to gamble, which I know happens a lot.
I think that they lock them in the trunk.
But the whole reason we went was to play bingo.
They have bingo there?
They have bingo.
It's pretty fun.
When?
They do it once an hour, and it's basically like 45, 50 minutes of bingo.
Holy shit.
You can do the electronic or you can do the paper play.
In the paper play, you basically get twice as many cards.
Is there a separate room for bingo or something?
A big banquet, like a convention room.
I have never seen the bingo room.
It says bingo in big old letters inside.
Like when you go in the door and head off to the right and around past the snack area, there's the bingo room.
But it's $12 for the paper play and the lightning progressive round and the validation.
But it's pretty fun, and, you know, I was really close to a blackout.
I mean, I was, like, three away.
Right.
So... Did anybody win anything?
Did one of you get three?
No, we didn't win.
Oh, bummer.
But I...
We went back to play on the slot machines, trying to earn money for the next game.
And I just randomly sat down in front of a machine, put a dollar in it, and got $15.50 back.
Cool.
It's one of those, you know, where you can play up to 15 lines or 9 lines or something.
Right.
And I got, I only played one line, get this, I played one line, the middle line, and it was the one that's all like the poker faces.
Right.
Like 10 and up.
And I got all 10s across.
I actually won like 17 off of it that I played a couple more rounds.
My future strategy for casinos, I've learned from LankyStyle, one of the folks you hear on Vanilla Sky, video poker is where it's at.
Honestly, when I was in Reno last time, the only place I made money was video poker, and that is all I'm ever going to play.
I lost all my video poker skills.
I don't know what happened.
That is all I'm ever going to play in the future.
When I was in Vegas for the ZDF Week moderatorship, I was at the end of my money when we were leaving.
I had...
50 cents in my pocket.
And I turned it into $10.
Because I needed a cap there.
I'm looking at the chat room, some of the comments on bingo.
We have some folks that say they hate bingo.
You get complimentary prune juice.
My grandma plays bingo with shuffleboard.
Was it a lot of old people there playing bingo?
There were old people there, but there were a lot of young people too.
You know what?
I'm noticing bingo seems to be like a younger and younger thing because we had a girl in one of my classes where I work and we asked everybody, you know, why are you hired at work and da-da-da, why did you decide to, you know, come to this place and work?
And one of the girls actually said, I have to fund my bingo addiction.
And she, get this, she had a daughter in her purse.
Not like a son and daughter, but like a bingo daughter.
A dauber.
Maybe not a daughter, a dauber.
She had a dauber in her purse with her, always.
You think we're obsessed on this show.
Well, the thing is that they actually have, you know, they've got sight machines, but they also have, like, soda fountain machines and coffee and tea.
And I made a latte there for myself.
I freaking played bingo and had a latte with whipped cream.
Well, they have a Starbucks in the casino.
You know what they have in the casino?
A fat burger.
I can't either.
I know, but it's...
Although I did hear they have turkey burgers, so I'll have to go there for a turkey burger.
Oh my god, I ate a pork cutlet.
It made me sick, too.
Did you go to the buffet there?
No, I ate it at my friend's house.
We wanted to go to Fresh Choice.
When you come back from Alabama, we'll go play bingo, and we'll go late so we can go to the buffet, because the buffet is so good.
The thing is, we played the 5-7 game, and the thing is that you don't get a second chance on the 5-7 game.
So we need to go play the earlier games if we're going to go.
Interesting.
So you can get a second chance to win because I was close.
Is it going 24 hours a day?
No, I don't think so.
Oh, well, shit.
The buffet is like... I know this is really interesting to all our listeners out of town, but just bear with us.
The buffet is only like $6 after 11 o'clock at night.
Holy crap.
Well, we should go.
You have to go late.
But man, if you don't eat all day...
and then go... What's it like during the day?
Pricey?
Like 15 bucks.
That's still not bad.
Not bad, but... Not for like a casino buffet.
Considering everything you get, not bad.
The one I went to at the... I want to say the Beaurevage, but that's one in Biloxi where my friend works.
But it was the Rio Casino.
They have a seafood buffet.
It was like 30 bucks.
But you get like
Main Lobster on the buffet, you know, that was like king crab, Alaskan snow crab and everything.
I was like, ha ha, fish.
Okay.
But that's, 15's not bad compared.
Well, we'll have to go and eat back.
But have fun in Alabama.
I don't know what we're going to do on the show without you while you're gone.
Well.
Because Loki and I, the last time we did a show by ourselves, it was very interesting.
Yeah.
Yeah, that was the first time Loki made super bacon on the air.
God.
I'm hoping we have a temporary fill-in somehow.
We'll get somebody.
I have to find my temporary fill-in.
We need to find a woman, because we need the female perspective on the show.
You know what?
We need to get... Yeah, we need to make Melody come down.
No, we'll figure something out.
We need to get Pixie, too.
I haven't yet to meet her.
I've heard good things about her, but I haven't met her.
Oh, Pixie Dust.
I'm thinking of the other Pixie.
There's two Pixies.
And then I'll have to, like, call.
You know what?
We'll just get all the women here in your absence.
We'll get Irene and Melody and Janae and ViolentHyperGirl.
We'll just get them all here one night.
We'll have a girls' night on Orange Lounge.
That's it.
And I'll just be sitting in the corner making fun of everyone else.
We'll see.
We'll see.
Well, so who knows what's going to happen when you're gone, but we'll still be doing shows.
You're going to miss Episode 69.
I cry.
That's okay.
But some more announcements about what's coming up to the stations.
Some big changes coming in November.
All through the month, really.
So we'll talk about that in a little while.
Oh my God, my voice still isn't all the way back.
Well, I was just about to go into... I can whine really well, but my voice is messed up.
I was just about to go into how was your week, how was your day, so I'll let you continue your bitching by asking you, how was your week, how was your day?
I didn't have a voice most of the week.
As everyone can tell, it's barely, barely back.
I...
Felt lots better, you know, progressively throughout the day.
The cough is, I guess as everyone can tell, mostly cleared up.
Although I still need the codeine at night.
I'm on happy drugs.
I took the last of my antibiotics today.
Whee!
Um, I didn't touch my Bimani except to lend it out to people while I'm out of town.
And... Shit, I should have gotten my ignition pad back.
Oh well.
That's alright.
He's gonna have the super ones done soon enough.
Okay.
Yeah, I haven't been able to play DDR while my asthma has been so bad.
But I'm going to play it in Alabama, and I'm going to play it if they still have it, the Beatmania 6 Mix Machine, if they still have it in the middle of the mall.
I'm looking forward to that.
Really, I didn't do a lot, much of anything.
Dan and I went out a bunch.
On Halloween, my work...
Every department decorated for a contest.
There's this one group that's in another building at the... I just told Bob where it is.
But there's another building back there that they did Studio 100M.
So they made it up like a dance club.
It was really nice, but one of the rooms upstairs was the super VIP room.
And they had baking powder out on a mirror with a laser blade to look like cocaine.
Oh, how nice.
And everyone was dressed up all 70s and everything.
Oh, that's a lovely picture.
One of the other places was, they did it up like the Old West.
It was really nice the way they did it.
It had a bum in the jail and everything.
And another one was the Haunted Pirate Ship.
and one was the 60s.
They did the 60s theme.
And you know what they handed out as snacks?
Brownies.
And this stuff called Bong Water.
Oh, how nice.
It's a drink that these people are making in Arizona and they're going to be marketing it here now.
Like in the next few months or so.
And I tried it and it's really good.
It's like, not really carbonated, but more like a flavored water beverage.
It's really good.
And now, customer service was the best.
We won best, of course.
Did you?
We were haven and heck.
And I decided that I was going to be in hell.
So I wore my evil boots.
Where you belong.
I wear my evil boots that I wore at Anime Expo from my Mad Hatter costume, the ones that make me, you know, instantly five inches taller.
Black pinstripe pants, this, you know, black sort of corporate looking atop.
And my black wings, I had, you know, lots of really gothy makeup and carried my whip with me and I was a modern day angel of death.
and all the cubicles were lined in black and the walls were black and red and we had a guillotine and we had the Grim Reaper hanging out in the corner.
Off with their heads.
We had these gates coming into the major walkways and they had fire raising from them.
We had little torches, fake fire everywhere.
And we had the lights off.
Fire's great.
So it was all red and fiery and everything.
I totally missed Halloween in my work, but I'll get into that later.
But, uh,
One of the girls at my work, her costume was the best.
She did the girl from The Ring, the TV girl.
Cool.
Keep in mind, I haven't seen The Ring, but I knew...
The Ring is, for a contemporary horror movie, it's really, really good.
I need to watch Ringu.
I have actually heard that some people, even folks that usually prefer Japanese cinema, actually say The Ring is better.
But I've heard mixed.
Well, I've heard that the Japanese one's more suspense and the American one's more horror.
Yeah, I could see that.
And I would go for the suspense over the other two.
and I watched movie trailers today.
Did you?
Preview for a movie I have to see.
What's that?
Alien vs. Predator.
Oh, crap.
Oh, give me a break.
That looks like crap.
Really?
No.
I'm going to see it because I've read some of the comics.
Alien vs. Predator needs to stay a video game.
Oh, I know it's nothing like the comics, but... I have a question.
I have a question that will determine if this... I have a question of all question that will determine if this movie will suck or not.
It's Sigourney Weaver in it.
Fuck this movie.
But I'm still going to see it.
I'm still going to see it just because I want to see all the action that ensues.
I don't care about the story.
I'm there to see predators and aliens beating each other up.
This movie ruins the continuity of all the sequels.
Seriously, it makes no sense.
I don't think it's supposed to.
It makes no sense.
It's just retarded.
I would rather see Freddy vs. Jason ten more times.
I'd watch the featurette on it.
I'd rather...
I'd rather go see The House of the Dead than this movie.
The story is utter shit, but I think the action's going to be good.
And I want to see the decapitations and shootings and blood and crap.
I want to see all... I'm going... I want to see it for the action.
Alright, fair enough.
So you're in it for the violence.
I'm in it for the violence.
Alright, fair enough.
That for me is going to be a gore bust.
Cheesy gore, I can deal with that as a reason.
However, let's see Alien vs. Predator vs. Ash.
How about it, huh?
How about it?
I'll just bring out the boomstick.
Question from chat room, Jamie.
Is the feature ad on the web somewhere?
If you go to apple.com slash trailers, it's actually in, I think there's four columns and it's in the second one.
Cool.
So what other movie trailers did you watch?
I watched one for Resident Evil Apocalypse.
That was funny.
Is that the sequel?
Yeah.
It's a commercial for this stuff called Regenerate.
And this woman, and you can tell it's obviously touched up, a young woman, but she's got it looking all wrinkled and everything.
And it looks like, for the people who saw Resident Evil, it looks like the T-Virus.
Thank you for watching!
Maybe I'll check out the sequel when it's on video.
You need to watch the trailer, though, because it is hilarious.
I'm sorry, the best movie, you know, game movie adaptions have to be, without a doubt, Street Fighter Double Dragon.
They rocked like nothing else.
Shut up, shut up, shut up.
No, I thought you were going to say Super Mario Brothers.
Has there been a really, really good one?
Well...
Mortal Kombat was decent.
Mortal Kombat was good.
When I was at that age.
You know what I thought was better than... Actually, it's another Van Damme movie that I thought was better than the Street Fighter movie that they did.
Because it seemed like it fit more in it.
What was it called?
The Quest?
Yeah, there was a Van Damme movie called The Quest.
That made me think of a Street Fighter flick.
What Street Fighter should have been.
I had that whole impression when I saw it.
And I went and saw that one in the theater because it was a dollar movie.
The whole reason I was there is because I went there to play one of my favorite games ever, Starblade.
Because they had the one with the big crane set up where you played 75 cents and you were in this full 3D motion.
Cool.
And they told me that I had to see a movie to keep playing the game, so I went and saw that.
And then I went to... Because I was like the only person who could...
The Last Starfighter.
Wasn't that the game?
The game came out after the movie.
Whatever!
It still ties together.
The Last Starfighter was a good movie.
You lose.
Try again.
But I know I remember it was a good one.
I just can't think of what it was.
Let's ask our chatroom.
What?
What do they think?
You know, we need to do a list list tonight.
What game needs to be made into a movie?
We can do it.
Just three of us?
Sure, why not?
We'll put four things on instead of three.
Okay.
Fair enough?
Okay.
Okay, I'm cool with that.
We haven't done that ever?
No.
Well, okay, we'll do that.
I thought we had two.
Well, I'll ask an Orange Lounge historian such as Dark Tetsuya or Angel that follows the show better than we do if we've done that before.
I don't think we have.
I don't think that we've done that one.
I know we've joked a lot about DDR the movie on this show, but I don't think we ever did that one.
What a big hoax.
You know, I laugh to this day about the people who thought it was going to happen.
I still think, especially after seeing the Parapara manga, which I think came up on Vanilla Sky.
I don't think it came up on this show because we didn't find it until Monday.
Actually, the Power of Power manga was the exact same story they were going to use for the DDR movie.
So, I'm thinking that people bought the story for the DDR movie and go, well, let's just put it with another Romani game.
They're never going to know the difference.
So, back to your week and your day.
I'm still waiting for Battle Royale Volume 3 to be out.
And I haven't had a chance to go by Kino Kuniya to pick up the others that I'm missing.
Apart from that, I decided that I'm going to start picking up another manga series after I'm done with Battle Royale.
And that's Berserk, which is still going and very expensive, but I don't care.
And that's really about it.
I spent lots of time with my boy.
Loki, we haven't heard much from you this show.
Hey, chat room, no flooding.
Alright, you're getting kicked.
Every last one of you.
Loki, we haven't heard much from you yet this show.
What's up?
I've eaten too much rice.
Had two bowls of rice.
I should have known better than that.
But, um... I didn't do anything this week.
And, um... Just kinda hung out.
Got a costume for Halloween.
Wore the costume for Halloween.
And, um...
I was working on my pads, or not my pads, my cabinet.
I was working on it.
I was going to finish it, or well, not really finish it, but start actually putting it together today.
But then I realized my measurements were off because the plans called for 5 eighths of an inch.
Thank you for watching!
I don't know, not too much other stuff has been going on.
Just been sitting at home and stuff inside because it's cold out.
And went down to the golf lane yesterday and that was okay.
Stupid people there.
I don't know, not much.
You'd think I'd be playing Castlevania since I bought it, but no I'm not because I don't care.
And thought about playing Zelda today but never actually got to play Zelda today.
and... I don't know.
Just broke, waiting for more money.
That's about it.
My week was interesting because I was on vacation this week, and originally my plan was to go to West Hollywood for Halloween, because, you know, I want to be with my people on Halloween.
But it didn't end up happening.
We decided to cancel the trip, mostly because of the fires that were going on in SoCal.
We kind of didn't want to end up in the middle of all of it.
My friend has really bad asthma and was afraid that the ash in the air might get to him, contacts as well, things like that.
and just some other stuff that came up.
So we ended up going on the trip.
So I've kind of just been having a lazy vacation.
I've just been sitting on my big butt.
I literally think I've gained three pounds while on this vacation.
And I don't care because I've kind of...
Just needed it, I think.
Because I've been working really hard non-stop for the past couple months.
And it's going to be crazy.
This holiday season right up until Christmas is going to be really crazy.
I'm just not going to have any time for anything.
So I'm kind of glad I got a little vacation before I have to go back.
Sometimes a vacation can be taken in your living room.
And I played a lot of Final Fantasy XI.
I'll talk about Final Fantasy XI a little later in the show.
Much to Jamie's dislike.
But she'll just have to deal with it.
That was pretty much my week and my day.
Today, not a whole lot going on.
I've just been sleeping in.
I tried to get myself back on a regular sleep schedule because I've got to get up early and go back to work tomorrow, so I don't want to be on too crazy of a sleep schedule because I don't want to be an irritable bitch tomorrow.
That's pretty much it.
Oh, at least you're not going in for the 5.30 shift.
No, but I am going in a half hour early tomorrow, which means we're going in at 7, which for me is early, so we'll see.
I think we work the same shift.
I work 7.30 to 4 usually.
Oh, 7.30 to 4.30.
We're about the same.
I only take a half for lunch.
I have something to tell you later, though.
Oh.
Which might be interesting.
Oh, really?
Yes.
My work is moving in a few months.
Oh, to near me?
to the area I used to work in.
Oh, okay.
That's cool.
Cool deal.
Okay.
Well, I think what we're going to do this break is we're going to take another break, actually, right now, and then we're going to come back.
And we actually have some Bambani things to talk about, so we'll do that.
We have the cage match still, the FUs of the week, of course, all that fun stuff.
What do you want to hear next?
Okay, we're going to, since we did an attack break last time, I think what we're going to do this time is we'll take a Taka break.
Won't that be fun?
Yay.
So we'll be back, and some Bomani news to talk about, among other things.
Join our chat room, www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on Chat.
And while I look for the MP3 I want this break...
I think that later on during the show, though, we need to do a break of another's.
We could do that.
Because, you know, I'm really, really, really, sometime today, wanting to hear a leading side for another.
We'll see if we can arrange that.
All right, we're going to take a break with some talk of music, and we will be back.
Thank you.
Thanks for watching!
Orange Lounge Radio.
We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
Howdy.
We're back.
Did you miss us?
Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 67.
We're in the middle of it right now.
Yeah, and it's gooey and sticky.
Big station news.
Big, big station news.
There's a lot of shit coming to the station in November.
First off, this Wednesday...
is the return of LiveWire, so you better be listening, because we don't want Loki to have another fit.
But no, if you're not listening, you're seriously missing out, because it's some good stuff.
And if you're not listening, you're a poopy head.
That's right, you're missing out on live mixing of Dance Trance and sometimes, sometimes, once in a while, a Bomani song.
Is there anything you want to say about Loki?
He's too busy thumbing through my Final Fantasy XI manual.
No, he says no.
Loki, you're being awfully quiet tonight.
Is everything okay?
Are you feeling alright?
Aw, he has a headache.
Do you want some Advil?
Oh, it's outside.
So we have Live Wire returning on Wednesday.
This week, by the way, this week and one week only, Vanilla Sky and Pump Up the Volume are changing nights.
So Pump Up the Volume will be on Monday, Vanilla Sky will be on Tuesday.
Just so you know.
And I'm probably going to be away from the computer quite a bit.
Don't tell them that.
Well, no.
But that has to do with Jamie's trip because she's leaving on Tuesday.
Yeah, because actually I packed today.
My clothes are packed today.
Oh, okay, cool.
I just have my other little things to pack.
And I'm hoping that people actually make requests this time around.
And lots of people listen, make it a good show for me because I won't be able to do it for two weeks.
But you get to hear old shows.
Yep.
But apart from that, you know.
Listen, request.
Also coming to the station in November.
Something that you guys have been asking me about for a long time.
Sunday, November 23rd.
Mark your calendars.
Sunday, November 23rd is season four of Orange Lounge Radio, the debut.
And that's going to be Jamie's return because she'll be back from Alabama.
And it's episode number 70.
And...
That is when the station is going to go to MP3 Pro.
Depending on Live 365's setup, we may or may not be able to have the live shows in MP3 Pro, but our Bomani Music Amore program will be in MP3 Pro.
For those that don't know what MP3 Pro is, we'll have details on our website at that point about how you can get DSL quality sound over your modem connection with MP3 Pro.
It's very cool.
What about cable quality?
Okay, cable, ISD, better quality, because life uses five plugs in its DSL quality.
I'm teasing.
Way better quality.
How about this?
Broadband quality.
There you go.
Broadband quality radio over your modem.
Power.
Great.
Oh, I had the ferret in the air.
And also, just before Jamie gets back from break, we will be setting the ferrets on fire live.
No!
I will hide the ferrets.
Hey, babies.
The ferrets love me, you hear?
Look, don't kill the babies.
You can't murder them!
You're gonna have to take them to Alabama with you if you don't want them to die.
You were anti-ferret.
I think that's all the news for now coming up to the station soon.
Yeah, you're right.
I'm anti-ferret.
There is one other thing.
I was hoping tonight we would have new Poppin' Music 10 MP3s to debut for you because we've gotten the connection to get the music for it.
There is some great stuff on the Papa Music 10 soundtrack.
Honestly, I know a lot of people have always been kind of, eh, Papa Music stuff's kind of cheesy, things like that.
But seriously, there's some good shit on Papa Music 10.
And you guys have to hear it.
For instance, Tack doing a duet with Desro.
Oh, God.
Very interesting.
It sounds a lot like Distress.
That would just make me so... Taco with a new trance song, and he got together with somebody, and I can't fucking remember who it was.
I apologize.
I'll have to see when I get the soundtrack.
And then, this is the greatest one of all.
Mr. T doing Goonies Are Good Enough.
Cool!
It is the coolest thing I've ever heard in a Bomondi game in my life.
I cannot wait.
So, um...
I can't wait.
That's going to be great.
I'm still looking forward to TAC.
What I'm thinking is maybe Thursday or so we'll have a Poppin' Music 10 debut special.
Something will be pre-taped.
It won't be a live thing.
Just some music so you guys can hear it.
That's going to be awesome.
I still remember being all happy about hearing the Yamato theme.
Yeah, the Yamato theme from Pop Music.
Maybe we'll play some Pop Music MP3s later.
And the Lem song.
What song?
The Lem theme song.
Oh, okay.
Urusei Yatsura, that was what it was.
So hopefully we'll have those pop music 10 MP3s for you soon.
There's also Guitar Freaks new music that's out too, but I don't know if there's anything on that worth playing right now.
Maybe we'll get to it later in the show.
We'll see.
I still think there should be more home versions of the Guitar Freaks games.
I do too.
I have a freaking drum manual controller and two Guitar Freaks controllers and no session.
No new sessions for me.
And they need to figure out how to get Keyboard Mania to work with it, too.
I agree.
My poor, dust-collected Keyboard Mania.
I haven't played Keyboard Mania.
I never even did bother to buy second and third.
Oh, I like second and third better than the first one.
You know what's nice?
I like the player in the second and third.
What's nice is I'll finally be able to dust off my 2DX controller because they have the signatures they needed or whatever to get the...
Get the new consumer style made.
I'm hoping that if I have the money available, I might just do the new arcade style controller release.
Ah, yes.
Just breaking down and ordering mine through Himeya.
I'm hoping that in the new 2DX consumer style, that they have every Konami original from 7th to 8th and 9th style.
That would be so beautiful.
I'd cry.
That would be pretty cool.
And you know, now that we've seen DDR Extreme, we know that Konami is willing to put 100 plus songs in a home mix.
So, there's no reason why they can't do DDR with us.
And then they need to put Tack in a box and ship him to my house.
Make him mix for me all day at gunpoint.
Well, let's see some other news going on right now in the Bomani world.
I wanted to read this for you guys.
I've got to pull up the story, though.
Jamie, fill time.
You know what?
What?
I'm sitting on the floor, and I don't know why.
Why are you sitting on the floor tonight?
It's comfy and it's not in front of the camera.
I can hide here effectively.
Not many places I can hide effectively from the webcam.
Actually, yeah, there are plenty of places.
Alright, here's what I wanted to get into.
It's the song list is released for DDR Xbox, DDR Ultramix, as a lot of us have been calling it, DDR Xbox.
The full song list is out, and so I thought we'd go over it and get your guys' reactions to the songs that are on it.
What do you guys think?
Loki, you with us?
Okay, cool.
.59 by DJ Taka.
Absolute, the Cuff and Stuff It Mix by Thuggy D, which would pretty much be Scotty D. That's stupid.
What?
It sounds kind of stupid, the name.
Yeah, the Cuff and Stuff It Mix sounds a little... I'm worried because I'm wondering if it's going to be like a rap version of Absolute, you know?
Okay, that would suck.
That would suck more than anything has sucked before.
Except for Let Them Move.
I'm going to just have high hopes.
Hi, we're still here.
Also on DDR Ultramix, After the Game of Love.
Notice it's not After the Game, but because Xbox will be a little more scandalous, they're going with After the Game of Love.
Happy.
So that's gone out.
A new transplant song from 2DX, Ballad For You, is going to be an Ultramix.
That should be interesting.
But it's Thomas Howard, so all you Thomas Howard fanboys and girls will be... That is not a good Thomas Howard song.
Well, like it or not, there it is.
Candy Heart...
will be in the new DDR.
Can't Stop Falling in Love, the speed mix by Naoki.
Oh, yay, speed mix.
Mandatory Naoki, mandatory speed mix.
A new licensed song, Castles in the Sky, Ian Vandal featuring Marsha.
That's going to be a song in Xbox.
Marsha, Marsha, Marsha!
We'll play that for you later in the show if we have time.
Does it suck?
It's pretty good.
I like it.
It's on the same par as Will I in Max 2.
I think I like Will I a little bit more, but Castles in the Sky is not bad.
Dive, by B4U Do That Thing, by Masai Drop the Bomb, the System SF remix
DXY by Tac, Electro-Tuned by Tac, Exotic Ethnic by Revengy, Healing Vision by Desire, At least it's not the stupid angelic mix.
What?
You don't like the angelic mix?
Oh my god, oh my god, stop, stop, stop.
The Angelic Mix is like one of my favorite remixes of any DDR song ever.
The Angelic Mix gives me a splitting headache every time I listen to it.
Is it just the beep?
Take the beep out, though, and it's a beautiful remix.
That's okay.
I still like the original better.
You are weird.
Hypnotic Crisis by the Blue Destroyers.
That should be interesting.
My first Kata.
That was my first Kata.
Hysteria by Naoki190, because you have to have your generic Konami trying to do rap song.
Another transplant from 2DX, and this is a really good one in my opinion, Infinite Prayer by LED.
And what's most interesting about that is I had heard rumors that LED had left Konami.
I don't know if they're true or not, but if I'm not mistaken, we haven't had any new LED songs in a while.
But kind of interesting, Infinite Prayer is going to be in DDR.
Which mix?
Is it just the standard?
It's the standard.
Wouldn't it be cool if they put the floating clock in?
Because that's my favorite mix of that.
It would be nice, and there are still ten unlocks, so you never know.
But this is the original that's going to be in it.
But the original original was, if I'm not mistaken, a club mix song before it was a 2DX song.
I think so.
Insertion, the Machine Gun Kelly mix, a remix of Insertion by Thuggy D. So we can look forward to a rap mix of Insertion.
That should be interesting.
But that might be kind of good because there's a lot of good rap out there about insertion.
Oh, by the way, there's something else I need to bring after this.
Oh, I'm going to stick my what?
I need to bring up something after the list.
All right.
Keep On Movin', the DMX mix by NMR Type G. It's kind of new, very interesting.
It's not new, says Loki.
Where is it from?
It's from Dance Maniacs.
Oh!
Oh, I'll be damned.
It sure is.
My bad.
My bad.
Oh, maybe we'll have to listen to that later.
Keep Your Body Movin' by Thuggy D. It's a new Konami original there.
Thuggy D. Oh, you have it?
Are we going to hear it if you... Okay, so this is a little bit of Keep On Movin' in the DMX mix.
Just a little clip.
I'm curious how different this is than the original.
It's kind of ghetto.
I don't think I like it.
Whatever.
Turn this shit off.
It sounds like a bad another.
God, I'm a stupid asshole.
DMX Mix, of course.
I mean, it's Dance Maniacs Mix.
God, I'm a tard.
You do know some rap mix.
Anyway.
Kind Lady by Okiatos.
Kind Lady.
We all know Kind Lady.
I like that song.
It's been in like every DDR mix.
You need the 80s one.
I like Kind Lady, too.
I'm glad it's there.
La Señorita Virtual.
The worst version of that song.
I don't think it's... I've heard much worse DDR mixes than La Señorita Virtual.
It doesn't... I never really cared for that one.
Okay.
Also going to be in DDR Ultra Mix will be Let the Beat Hit Em, classic R&B style, because it's just not DDR without some crappy mix of Let the Beat Hit Em.
You know, though, the only version of that one I really liked was the one that was in Max.
I think that's it.
That's the one.
Then that's the good one.
Let's Talk It Over.
That's a good song.
It's decent.
Look to the Sky, the True Color Mix.
Love to Me, the Disco Mix.
Cool!
By Yamato.
On the Jazz.
That's cool.
I'm kind of over On the Jazz.
Overblast by LED Light.
Paranoia Eternal, the fan-written Paranoia.
A New Transplant, new to DDUltraMix.
Quickening by DJ Taka.
That's a very cool one.
A licensed song, this will be a lot of fun, Paul Oakenfold with Ready Steady Go.
I don't know this song.
I have the CD.
It's on my CD.
Oh, cool.
It's like the first track, I think, on the...
On the Bucca CD.
Maybe we'll get to that song later.
Santa Malente Nante, of course, a fan favorite, Togo Project featuring Sana, that'll be good.
Secret Rendezvous by the Divas.
Ooh.
Sexy Planet by Crystal Aliens.
Kind of one of those songs that a lot of people thought we wouldn't see because American audiences can't handle the word sexy.
It's Sensual Planet!
It's Sensual Planet, but believe it or not, it is coming to DDR Ultramix.
This is the licensed song I'm most excited about, Shiny Disco Balls by Who Da Funk.
I love this song.
I can't wait to play it.
I've never heard it.
Late night, rock and roll, fellas.
Oh, we're going to hear a little clip of Shiny Disco Balls right here.
Can we hear a clip of it?
I'm not hearing it.
Get to the lyrics.
The lyrics are here.
We're skipping around the mp3 a little bit.
This is an extended mix of the song, so here we go.
I love this song.
It's really repetitive, but I love it.
Anyway, that'll be fun.
So In Love by Caramel S. Okay.
Okay.
That'll be in the Ultramix.
Superstar, DJ Rich featuring Tail Brothers.
God, has there been a home mix that Superstar was not on?
Sweet Sweet Heart Magic by June.
The Earth Light by LED Light.
That's cool.
A new Konami original by Thuggy D once again.
Therefore You.
That should be interesting.
Trip Machine, The Love Mix by 2MB.
The Love Mix.
And lastly, yes, Loki?
Go ahead.
Lastly, Sugaru, Revenge vs. Desire.
Yes, Loki?
There's also one that they didn't put on there, but it's going to be an unlock.
Mind Parasite from Dance Maniacs is going to be on there.
Also, Colors is rumored to be in the game as well.
Now, the interesting thing is, don't forget, there's ten unlocks.
But also, DDR Ultramix is going to have the pay for new songs feature, which is going to be interesting.
And this is what I've heard.
This is what's come off of DDR Freak.
I read in some post by Order of Chaos, who's the producer for DDR Ultramix, said something about five songs, five dollars.
What do you think?
Is this a good idea for DDR?
Shitty idea?
Yeah.
Only 10 unlocks this time, but 5 songs, $5.
What do you think, Loki?
That's fine, I'm sure, because it's obviously going to download to the hard drive.
So whenever there's a transfer of files, there'll be a way to pirate the songs.
And it doesn't matter anyways, because someone's going to buy it for $5.
Put the sim files online.
Dave apparently has forgotten about the little device called the Xbox GameShark.
and people with laptops.
Who can save those files to their laptops?
All illegality aside, let's assume we played by the legal way here.
What do you guys think of it?
That's $5 I could get a sandwich with.
That's only $5.
I mean, I throw $5 down for lunch, so, you know, I eat at home one day, I get five songs.
As long as they're not shit, because I can see it being, like, utter shit that they're going to put on there, but if it was good stuff, yeah.
Let Them Move, the Let Them Move remix, the, uh, you know, uh... The Let Them Move remix by... Uh, Forever Sunshine.
They have, like, a set of five that's all Newt remixes.
Ah!
Yes, they're going to have a pack with Forever Sunshine and Let Them Move.
And, God, what else is a DDR song no one likes?
Crash.
Crash, thank you.
And more B4U songs.
And then an original with Yoko Ono.
Yay!
The Bag For You, the Thuggy D remix.
Yes, it'll be Bag For You by Thuggy D. Featuring, um, what's her face from, from, uh,
You know what song needs to be in DDR?
What?
Shit.
Shit?
I don't know that song.
Panorama.
You know what's interesting about this mix?
You know what I'm just noticing that is very interesting about this mix?
There is only one song in this entire mix that has Politary in it.
I'm thinking one of those expansion packs.
I'm going to call it right here.
One of those expansion packs is going to be five Naoki featuring Politary songs.
God help us.
I'm going to bet you anything.
I know people that will buy it.
No, there's people who like the one who can't sing.
There's people who come to this show on Monday nights, this week, Tuesday, who like Politary.
So there are people out there who like Politary.
But I just think that's interesting.
You know what?
I wouldn't love this feeling to be in the new... Oh, there's a shitty DDR song I forgot about.
Hey!
I like that song.
And you remember why I... So when was Ultra Mix coming out again?
When was this coming out?
Ultra Mix is out November... Sometime this month.
I don't remember the date.
I think the 18th.
The 18th.
We'll see.
I want to get an Xbox anyway, so we'll see.
Hold this for a second.
I'll find out.
You're weak.
Oh, Jamie's going to make a phone call.
Actually, somebody in our chat room will probably post it.
But Jamie's going to get an official word.
Yeah, it's in the same post as the song list.
Thank you.
It is the November 18th.
Okay.
So, also rumored to be in the mix that we haven't seen any proof of yet, but Metal Gear Solid 2, the theme, I think it is.
Or maybe it's that mix from Six Mix.
Oh, yeah.
That would be awesome.
Very cool.
Do you have that Paul Loganfold song?
Do you want to play a little bit of that?
Oh, you don't have that one.
What about the other one that was in there?
There was another one we said we want to play.
Oh, Castles in the Sky, I have that one.
I have that.
You have that?
Let's race and see who can pull it up first.
This is really good radio.
I know, this is great radio.
By the way, I vouch for chloroseptic.
It really works.
Okay, got it.
Here's Castles in the Sky.
That's Castles in the Sky, if you're curious.
It sounds pretty typical.
Yeah, it sounds very much like Will I. I prefer Will I to that song.
But I heard a rumor that the steps were going to be insane to that song.
So we'll see.
They might have some really good original steps to that.
I have a little bit of news.
Oh, really?
Have you read anything on Yahoo?
Give me your news.
Now, the FCC...
has said that it is okay to say fuck on national television.
What?
Really?
As long as it is not used to describe fucking.
That's the same way, you know what, that's the same rule you can use to say the word fuck in a PG-13 movie.
You can't say asshole, but you can say ass.
Sweet.
So now you can say fuck on TV, I can't wait for next week's South Park.
If this is fucking annoying, or this is fucking stupid, or fuck him, or... I cannot wait for next week's South Park.
But yeah, it was like, and then I came up, I think it was someone who was accepting an award.
They go, well, this is fucking awesome.
Oh yeah, I heard about that.
And the SEC got a bunch of letters.
And it was like, well, he didn't actually say that, like, I'm going to go fuck this person.
I'm going to go home and fuck my wife.
Chat room's itching for us to get our cage match on.
What do you guys think?
Let's do it.
All right, let's do it.
I didn't have to think of one this week.
Yeah, I know.
You got saved this week.
Let's do the Orange Launch cage match tonight, shall we?
You know what sucks?
What?
I think I deleted Holic off my computer.
That's okay.
I know it's on Loki's.
I can get it through there.
How dare you delete any tax?
I had to delete so much stuff.
Buy a hard drive!
To make room for Final Fantasy XI, it's not even funny.
Get a hard drive!
That's alright, we have Holly.
You wanna know what?
What?
I have a 120 gig hard drive, and I've used, um, 50 of it.
I need to start burning all stuff off of my hard drive.
Alright, ready?
Because I'm lazy.
Tonight, in the Orange Lounge Cage Match,
Last week in the cage match, Jamie won the cage match.
And her song was, you want to introduce it?
It was Little Flower by Cyberex featuring Rapina, wasn't it?
I think it was.
And it won by quite a landslide.
So will it win by a landslide again tonight?
I don't know.
We'll see.
The way the cage match works, the three of us are going to pick a song, and you're going to pick your favorite.
And your favorite, determined by your votes that are sent to me in the chat room once we've done playing all three songs, your vote will determine what song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.
So here it is, song number one that you can vote for tonight.
Jamie's pick from last week.
Which one?
And you only get to hear a clip of it because it is the winner.
This is Cyber X featuring Rapinoe with Little Flower.
Enjoy.
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Alright, that was song number one.
Last week's winner, CyberX featuring Rapinoe with Little Flower.
Alright, and I forgot to put that in the chat room.
Usually I announce what songs one and two are.
So, Jamie, tell us how wonderful that song is while I do that part.
I think it's a nine.
It's trancy.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You already rated it last week.
You just have to go on about how great it is.
It's awesome.
You really, really like the song because y'all really seem like tramps.
and it doesn't get much trance-ier than that.
Unless it's Das Schrockenspiel, which puts me in a trance every time I drive and I usually run into things.
Alright, Loki insists I do his song next.
Oh, he's going to find it.
Well, then I'm going to go next.
All right, my song I've picked tonight is kind of an older song.
It's a few years old.
And actually, those of you that listen to Understation Live on a regular basis may recognize this song because I know it's one of Travis' favorite break songs.
But I've just been really addicted to this song lately, and I think it would be awesome for DDR.
In fact, I'm going to convince Loki to put it on his bootleg mix that he does.
But I love this song a lot, and I hope you guys do too.
I really didn't have any other good choices for tonight, so I picked a nice little poppy techno song for you guys.
I forgot to make a comment on the chat room.
Okay.
Oki is not spelled with an H. It's O-O-K-I if you're going by Papa Romaji.
Thank you.
Well, thank you for clarifying.
All right.
Now, back to Gage Match.
Sorry.
That's alright, it's alright.
The song I picked is Tina Cousins, and it's called Mysterious Times.
So I hope you guys enjoy.
Thanks for watching!
You'll only see what you see
Thank you for watching!
Okay, that was song number two tonight.
That was Tina Cousins with Mysterious Times.
And what'd y'all think?
Jamie?
Um, it was pretty good.
It was, uh, kind of repetitive.
I'm eating rice.
I got good rice, too.
It doesn't taste like minute rice, either.
Um, but no.
It was okay.
I give it an eight.
Loki!
It was okay.
Seven.
Um, I was kind of strapped for songs this week, so I know that's not the best I can do, but I still like it.
I mean, it's a perfect DDR song.
It's so perfect for DDR, so I give it eight or nine.
Eight and a half.
All right, Loki, what's your pick for this week?
My pick for this week is Cool and the Gang, and it's a song called Get Down on It.
It's the DJ Jimmy Jam's, I've got to get the full title here as it scrolls on by here.
It's a Bootleg remix by DJ Jimmy Jam, whatever that is, and it's Get Down on It 2001.
by Kool and the Gang.
Alright, let's try it out.
Here it is.
Loki's pick for this week.
Kool and the Gang.
Get down on it.
We don't wanna dance
Okay, sorry about that.
Um, we were, um... Sorry, I had to get food.
...eating.
Let me turn that down.
Sorry!
Alright, uh, Cooling the Gang with Get Down On It, 2001.
Jamie.
It made me think of roller skating for some reason.
Um, it gets a 7.5 for nostalgic coolness.
Loki.
I give it a 9 because it's like the second song that's on my CD that I'm listening to right now.
First one being last week's pick that no one seemed to like.
I give it a 3.
It's boring.
I didn't like it.
You get no rice now.
I hope you choke on it.
You give my songs shitty scores all the time.
I gave it a 7, you ass.
This is an exception.
I didn't like it.
Deal with it.
Cool in the Gang is usually good.
Cool in the Gang is usually good.
It just wasn't good.
Alright.
And what if it was Jungle Boogie?
Alright, who gives a shit what I think?
It's up to the chat room now.
Send your votes in the sky over private message once we recap here.
Here are the three songs you can vote for tonight in tonight's cage match.
Last week's winner, Cyber X featuring Rapinoe with Little Flower is the first song you can vote for this week.
If I can get a clip of it.
Alright, song two you can vote for this week is Tina Cousins with Mysterious Times.
Alright, and song number three you can vote for this week is Kool and the Gang with Get Down On It, the DJ Jimmy Jam mix.
Alright, send those votes in now over private message to Sky in the chat room.
Alright, Loki, is there anything going on in the sim world this week that's worth talking about?
Uh, no.
I have my beeps, I apologize, if you guys, oh, sorry.
If you guys are hearing beeps over the air, I apologize, I don't, they're not turned off for some reason, they got turned back on, so just deal with it.
Um, no, nothing really going on, unless you count, like, Turning Mix 4th Plus, but, uh, no.
Yeah, why don't you turn it off, you lazy bastard?
What do I turn it off at?
Yeah, people don't like hearing beeps.
Shut up.
I'll see if I can find the sounds option.
Well, sort of sim-related, I guess.
It's been noted on a few of the message boards that that stupid bootleg DDR Megamix is actually running off a ported version of Step Mania to the System 573 boards, which, you know... Really?
For those who don't know what that is, that's the hardware that all DDR machines run off of.
So it's technically Step Mania running on that and some special software and a hacked security chip.
So why did the freeze arrows look like shit?
Because some of the files were corrupted on the disk.
That's why.
It was supposed to look nicer than that.
But it doesn't matter though because it's still just DDR Extreme.
They didn't add any new songs.
My favorite, though, is Don't Fall Off.
Yeah, Don't Fall Off.
Or the AT-ST will step on you.
Anyways, yeah, that's pretty much all that's going on, nothing really big other than that, I mean, I'm sure, I think they're in the process of making DDR, um, or Dancing Stage Fever, converting the songs over for Stepmania, and they're still working on DDR Extreme, even though I could have had them done weeks ago, but I just don't care anymore, so, you don't get them from me, so there, and, um, yeah, that's pretty much it, nothing really, oh,
Well, we could talk about Into the Groove.
I guess that's similar.
Why not?
Go for it.
A new arcade dancing game that's being developed by the people that do Step Mania.
Chris Danford, Kiel, who you might remember, we have a song of his in rotation.
And also Foyboy, I guess, or Fubi, I forget which one it was.
I think it was Fubi, because he does the steps on DWI Insanity.
So basically they're making their own home version, or not home version, but...
eventually is going to go there, but right now they're doing arcade mixes with this into the groove thing, which it's like DDR, it's more like, I don't know, it's just really weird looking.
That's all I got to say.
They're doing those there.
But so far, it's like, I don't know, I've listened to some of the music on there, and it sucks.
It sucks really bad.
I mean, Kiel's good and all for, I guess, making music, but I don't like any of the music that's in there so far.
You just think they picked the wrong ones to put in the game.
I don't know, they're just lame.
They suck.
It's just like playing that other game I was playing earlier.
Oh, we'll have to talk about that later, too.
God, no, it's not very good.
They're like, this one guy posted this mp3 of the song Utopia that he loves, and I downloaded it and listened to it, and it's crap.
I don't like it.
I think it's retarded.
Well, you know, that's just your big fat opinion.
Well, my big fat opinion counts because... You have a microphone.
Yeah, I have a microphone.
I have pretty good taste in music.
There's a lot of music, you know...
Thank you for watching!
This is the stuff that should be in there, but isn't.
But they're going to license music, they say, which I don't think they're going to actually physically license music.
But anyways, the whole thing runs off of Linux, because they don't want to pay for Windows XP for every single machine.
So it's running off of Linux.
It's pretty much a reworked StepMania.
It's more or less StepMania, and they have different arrows and stuff.
New mods and shit and mines and all the crap that Stepmania has.
It's just, I don't know.
I watch people play.
Oh, and there's songs with 11 and 12 footer steps.
I think that is so unnecessary.
It's retarded.
I guess I shouldn't knock it until I've tried it, but I think the whole notion of songs that were built to kill people is just unnecessary.
Honestly, Max Period was overdoing it.
It was overdoing it.
That end where it gets 600 beats per minute and stuff, that was just, it gets gay.
Not to mention that the song was ass.
It's just, it was really, really stupid what they're doing with it, but you know.
Whatever.
They say it's 50% done.
They can always change that stuff later if people don't like it.
But the people they have testing it, if they're like, ooh, I get the bar rape on this song, it's harder than Legend of Max.
With all due respect to the folks up in Seattle, there are the unreal players up there who can do this 11 and 12 stuff no problem.
I just, I worry that that's going to influence the development of the mix.
And it's just like, you know, okay, maybe one or two songs, yay, great, but keep it to a minimum.
Me, personally, I enjoy those fun 7 feet songs.
I like some of the Max 2 USA Steps.
I realize I'm in a minority.
But I kind of like the fun stuff more than I like the let's kill me steps, you know?
The whole point is, I mean, sure people like a challenge, but people like fun, intelligent steps, too.
There's a lot of songs that have intelligent steps, like Superstar.
Superstar's a fun song to play, and it's not that hard.
It's just fun.
That's the whole point.
And people play them over and over.
I mean, once you play a really hard song, the only reason you play it is to show off to friends and say, oh, look, I beat this song.
I mean, that's pretty much it.
It's not like you play it for your own benefit.
I don't know.
The whole idea about, you know, what the hell?
Just let Jamie play with the webcam.
She's having fun.
Okay, okay.
Anyway, it's the whole point of people making these bootlegs and stuff.
It's just, I don't know, it's very interesting to me and how Konami, because technically Konami can't really do much about it.
because the machines aren't supposed to be over here in the first place.
And they're kind of just getting by licensing in various manners by pretending they don't exist type of thing.
And so kind of people have free reign on doing that.
The only people that can come down on them are people in the United States like the RIAA and stuff like that.
Now, I think where they're going to run into trouble is because they're selling the machine, and that's a problem.
Now, my thing on it, which I was posing to our local arcade here, is that you just do one custom homemade upgrade for...
One Arcade.
I think the damage done by that would be minimal and the risk on it isn't that bad.
The repercussions would be like nothing.
So I posed that idea to our arcade manager and they're actually interested.
So I don't know.
We'll see.
But I know later this week I'm going down to the arcade and we're going to rip open the machine to see what we can do as far as feasibly upgrading it that way.
And all I've got to say is if I do end up doing that, it's going to look nice and it'll be a lot better than all this other shit.
And I've got word from... I heard this.
This was pretty big news.
Well, supposedly.
I don't know.
They posted this about the next generation DDR.
Oh, yeah?
But it's going to be coming out in like two or three years.
Oh, my God.
Yeah.
What about this Euromix that they're getting that's going to be on the new hardware, supposedly?
Well, that's Euromix.
But still... They get stuff.
Well, remember, if you remember... It'll be a preview of what we can expect.
They were supposed to do new hardware with DDR Extreme, but they never did.
True, true.
So...
I mean, for all this talk that DDR is dead in Japan, I mean, then why was Xtreme the number 7 selling game its debut week in the top 10?
It doesn't matter.
Look at QDX.
You have to freaking beg for a new game.
That's a whole other story, though.
That's just Konami being dicks.
Alright, you guys want to know who won the cage match tonight?
Sure.
Tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge cage match is Holic.
No, it's...
It is a tie, ladies and gentlemen.
The tie tonight.
Stop tying people, God.
I know, they always tie like every week.
We used to never have ties, and lately in like past eight shows we've had like six ties.
Anyway, the tie tonight is between two songs.
It's between last week's winner, Little Flower.
And...
The second song that tied this week is Cooling the Gang with Get Down On It, the 2001 mix.
So, as you know, when we have a tie in the Orange Lounge Cage Match, the host who did not win in the tie would get to break that tie.
And, oh, that's me tonight.
My song only got one stinking vote.
Your song sucks.
That being said...
This is a no-brainer.
I vote for Jamie's.
Loki, you the man.
But that song is the suck, so I pick Little Flowers, this week's cage match winner, for two weeks in a row, so enjoy.
I like the dog.
That's alright, I was going to pick something really shitty, but I could not find that damn track for the life of me.
It was Boys for Love.
Hey, what?
Boys for Love.
And it was a song about being gay, but I couldn't find it.
And it was really funny.
It's just like, it's a DDR song I had, but I can't find it.
I don't know where it went.
Are you going to put it in your mix?
I could, that would be funny.
If I find it, maybe.
Alright.
So... I think I'll take a break.
When we come back, we'll do the FUs of the week.
So send those over private message to Sky.
Hi, I'm in the chat room.
And if you have something to bitch about, we're going to get it out in the open on this next break.
In the meantime, we've done a TAC break.
We've done a TACA break.
I think now, like it or not, I think it's time to do Naoki break.
What do you guys think?
Don't cry.
No, we're going to play some good Naoki stuff.
So we will be right back after this break.
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter D, the letter A, and the number 59.
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
Hello everybody, it's time to do the FUs of the week.
Jamie, what are the FUs of the week all about?
Where we get pissed off and tell everybody.
My first FU of the week is a very important one.
FU to adultery.
I'm not going to go into specifics about it because it involves a pretty good friend of mine.
But there's no excuse for it.
and I can't really vouch for anyone who goes through with it who is... I'm not getting into details, but just in general.
I can't, I can't stand it.
So.
Next thing!
Um, uh, F you to people who go 10 miles under the speed limit in front of you and then people who match your speed in the lane next to you so that you can't change lanes.
Um...
You know what, I'm not really all that angsty because I'm still looking forward to my vacation.
Gasp.
F you to probably not having reliable internet access while I'm in Alabama.
But I'll do what I can.
And of course, F you for no remote way of me contributing to the show.
That's really about it.
I did, however, notice something.
The Radio Shack logo looks remarkably like the Battle Royale logo.
I think it's a government plot.
They're gonna make us all kill each other with remote-controlled cars, batteries, and Walkmans.
and PhilPort, a PCS for everybody.
Okay.
E.T.
Stallio.
All right.
Loki, you ready?
I caught the mic.
Okay.
Actually, yes, I am.
Fuck you, you stupid bastards at Golf Land.
Not necessarily people, because, you know, people will be stupid and they'll flock no matter.
Yes, I'm saying the bastards working behind the snack counter at Golf Land yesterday around 7 p.m.
You suck because first off you had to go make a stupid comment about my shirt.
Yes, I know what my shirt says and the fact that you comment about it does not make you seem any more intelligent.
And I don't care if your friend is afraid of ninja monkeys or ninja squirrels or any ninja rodent of whatever the case may be.
I don't care and I also don't care that
you're out of the large cup size, I want a soda, give me a fucking soda and just because you're stupid enough to drop the piece of pizza on the floor and you give me the larger slice by calling it the special piece of pizza, I don't really care and the fact that you tried to give me the piece of pizza attached to the giant cardboard circle it was on there to begin with I want it on a fucking plate
And you try to get me on this giant piece of cardboard, what the hell am I supposed to do with that?
This guy was a complete idiot.
Not surprising, you know, working at Golfland.
But yes.
Um, other than that, um, I don't like the cold, so fuck you Mother Nature for making it cold all of a sudden.
It was like 90 degrees one day, and then it dropped down to 50.
You can't just drop the temperature 40 degrees and expect anyone to, like, not care.
I have a comment to make.
Okay.
I talk to what the weather is in Alabama right now, and at nighttime, the low is 66 degrees.
Oh, that's cool.
And fuck you to my bank, because I was overdrawn on my account for, like, five bucks, and they charged me 60.
So, they suck.
Sue them!
I can't sue them.
All you have to do is get a credit card with your bank.
So if you overdraft, it pulls from your card and you're not charged any fines.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
See, I used to do that, too.
I used to have a credit card.
That's a big mistake.
Because not only do they charge you the $30 for overdrafting, they charge you a fee on your credit card, too.
It's just a big scam.
What bank do you bank with?
Wells Fargo.
No wonder.
Hell's Cargo.
So anyways, yeah, they suck, but whatever.
So, I'm done.
Alright.
My FU this week is a real no-brainer for me, actually.
Usually I have to sit here and think about what I'm going to say FU of the week to for a long time, but this week it's easy because I got really pissed off at Final Fantasy XI earlier this week.
so my app used to play online the Sony people because when you put in your credit card information you can't put in a space bar your name is not allowed to have spaces if you don't
I'm sorry, if you have a space in your name, you don't exist to the Final Fantasy people.
So, I had to call tech support and all that stuff.
And they don't take... They won't register you over the phone at tech support for whatever reason.
I don't know why.
I'm sure if I bitched or whined enough, they probably would have.
But luckily, the guy and I were able to make it work somehow, so...
I finally was able to get online.
The guy on the other end of the line at PlayOnline was actually very nice.
It was very good customer service and tech support, so it helped ease my anger a little bit.
But whoever thought that one up to disable the space bar, come on, why do you disable keys?
You never know when somebody might need to use it.
And for the record, I go by my middle name, actually, so I use my first initial.
My bank has me in the system as my first initial space middle name.
So, I'm something space Robert in the system.
So, that's why.
Yeah, I know you know, but we can keep it a secret.
I promise.
And it's a nice name for me.
So, whatever.
Name shmame.
So, screw you, whoever decided to come up with that disabling the space bar.
We're out in hell.
And it took me, I'll also FU to Final Fantasy XI because it took me about five hours to install.
But once I got in there, oh, fuck, it's beautiful.
I'm wondering if I installed the data I have, if it would work.
Either way, you're going to have to sit there and download the two-hour patch.
I doubt it will work, but it's worth a try.
You don't have to pay for anything.
Because I know there's people who already have.
I think the beta people had to upgrade, I think.
That's stupid.
Thank God for Ragnarok.
Alright.
Into the chatroom, FUs.
Bag4U says, Hey Sky, send an FU to Konami for being anal about the 2DX release.
I agree, that was kind of stupid of Konami.
23rd Magus says, F you to slow leveling in Ragnarok Online.
F you to my DDR skills slipping, I can't pass Sakura anymore.
And a big F you to concert tickets being so overpriced.
I'm sorry, but $30 a seat?
What?
You want to rate my wallet some more?
Damn.
Hey, $30 is actually pretty cheap for a concert.
Don't feel bad.
I was pricing the tickets for Alan Jackson and they're $45 apiece.
You want to go see Elton John in Vegas?
Prepare to pay $100 for the cheap seats.
Crazy.
God, it's just nuts how much some tickets cost.
John Fields would like to say, F you to Microsoft, your piece of shit software thinks my D drive is corrupt.
Now I have to rebuild my computer while trying to save as many files as I can.
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you Microsoft and your XPOS.
Fuck you to twisting my ankle today.
Oh, and fuck you to Microsoft again.
Why not just use a second hard drive and move the data?
You know what?
When I installed Final Fantasy XI, something similar happened to me where it was trying to boot for my disk drive.
And thank God Brad was here because he was able to fix it.
I wouldn't have known what to do.
I would have broken down and cried.
At the $50, I would have wasted on nothing.
All right.
Let's see.
Joe Mama would like to say, My FU of the week is to the shitty PC controls for Final Fantasy XI.
I got used to the PC controls myself, but I received a tip from LankyStyle, who was a beta tester for Final Fantasy XI.
He says, use a Kiki Joy.
It makes it a lot easier.
Get the PlayStation controller hooked up to the computer, and you'll enjoy Final Fantasy XI a lot more.
I will try that in the future.
Snub Dishonored says, Fuck the children that didn't come to my house and left me with about five full pounds of Kit Kats, Twixes, and various other assorted candies.
You're complaining?
I'll take them.
Now I have to eat all this crap or throw it out.
Thanks a lot, you fucking overprotective parents.
You're saving your kids but killing my bowels.
Runs to bathroom to shit out chocolate.
So that's lovely.
Maybe I should have poisoned my candy to give those parents a real reason to keep their kids at home.
Yeah, then you'd still be stuck with it, and then you'd just have to throw it away.
God, it's a waste of chocolate.
I know.
You know what?
Take it to school.
No, 830.
Wampa164 would like to say, fuck you to the hot topic raver wannabe 14 year olds who spend their entire weekend from Friday until Sunday at the mall's arcade and causing me to not single digit grade exotic ethnic, going from 4 grades within 15 seconds left to 14.
This T underscore T brought to you by me.
Minced.
Went home from college for the weekend.
That's the basis of my FU.
FU to the local arcade.
They now have a pump-it-up machine.
It lags every time you hit an arrow and sometimes the song will just cut out.
They should have gotten the second DDR machine they said they were gonna get.
Fuck you to it raining for 11 days straight over here.
Maybe they don't know the difference between pump-it-up and DDR.
Zodiac Knight would like to say, I have no fuck you's because I love everyone equally.
Awww.
Hairball, sorry.
Pixie Dust would like to say, okay, fuck this, I'm actually happy, I only have three F you's this week.
Fuck Bacardi151 and being drunk to the point where I passed out when I got home.
Fuck dieting because I'm still the same damn weight.
And as always, just because what if you wouldn't be complete without Pixie Dust saying, Fuck having big boobs.
I can't do step aerobics properly with these things flopping like two puppies.
Okay, I'm done and love you, Rob.
Love you too.
You know what?
And notice how no love for Jamie or Loki.
It's all me.
Oh, shut up.
I'm the best.
No, you know what?
They make an exercise bra that's really good for big boob women.
I used it for a while.
Boobs.
Yes, Loki?
What are you doing, Loki?
I'm going to go to the next FU.
I just need someone to comment on.
What?
Oh, what do you want to comment on?
BananaBoobs.com?
No.
Um...
Yes.
About the dieting thing, don't diet, do a lifestyle adjustment.
That's good.
Oh, and she says in the public chat room, love you, Jamie.
Yay, we love you too.
What's the link you're going to post?
Some boob thing, some straight man thing.
This game rocks, and this is for you, Pixie Dust.
Frontal Assault, the ultimate boob game.
Okay, this game rocks, okay?
It's just awesome.
DJ Spector would like to say, fuck you to Max 300.
I agree.
It's been a while since I've said fuck you to Max 300, but goddamn, the Maxes suck.
Get over it.
DJ Spector would also like to say, fuck you to my fucking asshole of a Spanish teacher that I have.
You know, my Spanish 2 teacher, my least favorite teacher of all... No, my second least favorite teacher of all time.
You know what, Rob?
What?
I never took Spanish.
But I took French and Japanese at the same time.
¿Cómo te llamas?
¡Fuego!
El teléfono es el fuego.
¡Lucha libre!
¿Dónde está el baño?
Just like all the words I know in Spanish right there is lucha libre and...
LastFU, Telemundo, Wampa164 would like to say, Fuck Halloween for being a shitty holiday that's more of an excuse for people to vandalize people houses and property by teenagers.
The end.
Pixie Dust also says, I love Loki too, but don't tell Nelly.
As Loki brings up the world domination of the boob game that Jamie is watching.
What the fuck is this?
It's this giant pair of tits that you kind of use your hand to kind of throw.
It's kind of like DDR in a way because these little things scroll down the screen and you have to do the steps.
You have to do tricks with the boobs.
Like you either have to swing them one way or you do like a spiral or you have to just bounce them up and down.
It's all very interesting.
I swear.
Okay, as Jamie is fascinated by the boob game.
This game is stupid.
I think what we'll do is we'll take another break.
Okay.
And this break is going to be an LED break.
Somebody suggested to me, I forgot who, but I'm sure they'll be happy to hear that we're going to do an LED break because LED is awesome, and we need to hear some more LED songs.
So we're going to play some right now for you guys.
So enjoy this break, and we'll be back.
And we're going to do listless when we come back, yes?
Yes.
All right.
We'll be back.
Ranma S and Destroyer
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thanks for watching!
Chile, Pimson, Nessie
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
Are you one of these staffers by Hollywood?
No!
Do we care what people think of us?
No!
Do we want people to kiss our ass?
Yes!
Extreme Bomani Radio.
That's us.
Orange Lounge Radio.
You know what's funny is that promo predates DDR Extreme.
That promo?
Yes.
That was made right before the second show.
Because I was gone for the second and third shows.
I was in Alabama.
I swear to God, when you get back from Alabama before season four premieres, we're going to sit down and do new promos for season four.
And that's going to be our treat to everybody.
Yeah, well, I'm back the whole Wednesday with nothing going on.
I remember somebody said Guardian Legend because Guardian Legend comes up on every list.
Something like that.
I'm almost positive that was done before, so we decided to shelve it.
Instead, we thought we'd go the other way around and say movie they most need to make a game out of.
We haven't done listless in a long, long time, so I'm going to explain how this works.
This is excluding ones that have already been done, by the way.
Yes, excluding ones that have already been done.
Or similar, because that took half of mine.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
and then we're going to have our big list, the definitive list and then we'll go around and the fun part is we each take one off one that we feel is not deserving to be there, it really shouldn't be there so we're going to take one off then the chatroom gets the ultimate say, the chatroom gets to vote on the definitive top three list tonight's topic, movie they most need to make a game out of so, here we go
First up, we have... Wait, you want to start, Jamie?
Sure.
Alright, Jamie, your number four pick for tonight.
The number four should be The NeverEnding Story.
Make it an RPG.
Any reason why NeverEnding Story?
Just...
Because it would have a kick-ass theme song.
Yes, quite.
Dear God, I hope... I want the whole... I want a whole... Ring in.
Okay, then take that off the list.
On PC, PC games don't count.
Okay, take it off.
Dua.
Aw.
Labyrinth.
I know they had a Labyrinth game on Commodore 64.
But that can be one of those really old games that needs to be updated.
Okay.
All right, Labyrinth.
Because then that means rendered David Bowie.
Exactly.
All right.
Okay.
Okay.
Nobody played it.
It was on Commodore 64.
Nobody played it.
Yeah.
Anyways.
My pick is going to be... God, there's so many.
I'm going to have to go with Showgirls because I can see it now.
You're struggling to get to the top of the world.
Do whatever it takes.
It's a story about survival.
I like that idea.
That sounds like it would be a really emotional kind of game with a really great backstory.
You don't know shit!
You don't know shit!
One of my very favorite movies of all time.
A pick close to my heart, Loki.
Thank you.
My number four pick...
is a game that it actually did have a game back in the 80s and they even updated it somewhat recently but all it was was a newer version of the 80s game and it sucks I want them to just scrap it all and do a new one The Rocky Horror Picture Show Is it a game?
They did a game and it sucks ass, so they need a new one.
What was this on?
It was on Apple 2E.
And then they did an updated version of it not too long ago, but it was just an updated version.
It sucked.
They need to totally just scrap the concept and do a new one.
I'm going to give them a do-over.
And technically, it's a game based on the play.
It's a Rocky Horror show game.
So they haven't done the game for the Rocky Horror picture show.
So that's my loophole.
So it'll be missing a couple of songs there.
My number four pick is the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
All right.
My number three.
Number three, Jamie.
Is Monty Python and the Holy Grail RPG.
Just think of the potential, especially with, who was it that did it, Terry Gilliam?
Mm-hmm.
Doing all the artwork for it.
It'd be awesome.
It'd be awesome.
I'd love it.
And, of course, they need to insert the... The one-on-one with the Black Knight.
The Ministry of Coconuts.
Mm-hmm.
You know, a little snippety.
It could be a rhythm game.
Proper use of the coconut.
They could be a special controller.
You'd play as, what was his squire's name, Patsy.
Yep.
And then you can eat the minstrels.
You can eat the minstrels.
And that was much rejoicing.
Yay.
Loki, your number three pick.
A newer one that just came to my head right now.
Orgasmo, the video game.
Orgasmo.
Pink Flamingo's The Game
Pink Flamingos is a John Waters early movie.
It's one of the most disgusting films ever made.
And it's about two people.
I should say three people because there's a couple and Divine, of course, in one of her best roles ever.
They're in a competition to be the filthiest person in the world.
And imagine if you could participate in that competition to be the filthiest person in the world.
And at the end, like the last stage, you can eat dog shit.
I just had an odd thought.
What?
They've made, created a machine that merges two people into one.
And so they take John Waters and John Hughes.
Imagine!
Then you just get hairspray.
Oh, yeah.
Alright, anyway.
Your number three pick, Jamie.
My number three pick.
I'm sorry, your number two pick.
My number two pick is Kill Bill.
Having to go through your enemies, and then all the fight scenes play like Bushido Blade.
God damn you, that was my number one.
You better not take my number one or I'll kick your ass.
All right.
You know what my number one is.
I can guess.
Loki.
Oh, this one should be easy.
The Oral Adventures of Kraven Moorhead.
What?
Please explain.
I can see this one playing out like Commander Keen or something like that.
It's a porno movie, folks!
But hey, it's got 17 videos already.
With a movie, you know, with a franchise that large, it needs a game.
I mean, alright, alright, fair enough.
My number two pick... Right... My number two pick is a movie you probably have never seen, but I'll explain it for you.
It's Trick, the game.
Trick is a nice little piece of gay cinema that's about two guys that just run into each other on the subway that are trying desperately to find a place to fuck.
And I'm thinking this will make an exciting video game.
It could be like one of those stealth games.
Have you ever played Thief?
That could be it.
It could be like, we've got to find a place to screw right now.
And there's a time limit and everything.
Trick the game.
And it could even have a cameo from Tori Spelling, just like the movie did.
It would be beautiful.
So Trick the Game is my number two pick.
My number one.
Yes, you're number one, Jamie.
Now, I was thinking of Scanners, but then again, there was Galarians, where you have people thinking at people hard enough that it makes their heads explode.
They already did that.
And all kinds of others.
But I figured, in keeping with, because it's me, we'd have Battle Royale.
Of course.
And it would work and make it like you have survival horror mode or you have multiplayer mode.
And then your friends, if you've got Xbox, put it on Xbox, network those bad boys.
You could have the whole classroom.
Who would win?
Think about it.
Excellent.
Catch.
All right, Loki, your number one pick for a movie that most needs to be a game.
No one except for maybe the people in the studio have actually seen this movie since it's that awful.
But it needs a game, and I will put the picture up on the cam.
It is Cheerleader Ninjas, the movie.
Cheerleader Ninjas.
I would love to see a game for this.
Awesome.
Can you briefly explain what this movie is about for those that may not have seen it?
It's about these cheerleaders who are being blamed for smut on the internet.
And they have to fight these nuns.
And there's this gay guy who's like the head, you know...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I'm not sure if this movie had a game.
Jamie took my number one, so I'm having a stretch here.
But I'm thinking the more I think about it, this would be an awesome game.
It may have already had one.
I don't know, though.
Did Starship Troopers have a game?
Yes.
Damn it.
It was a 3D first-person shooter game.
Damn it, damn it, damn it.
I got one.
You can do Contact, the game.
No.
You play through the whole game and you find out that the boss is just her dad.
No.
Fuck that.
No contact the game.
I don't want that shit.
Geely the game.
You struggle.
No.
No Geely the game either.
I need more ideas.
I think I'm liking the idea of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back the game.
I was going to say that.
Or better yet, Clerks.
Let's do Clerks.
Clerks the game.
That was on my list.
That was on my list.
We're going to do Clerks the game.
I'm not even supposed to be in this game.
I'm not even supposed to play this today.
That could be the tagline.
It could be beautiful.
Or it could be like a sports game, Clerks Rooftop Hockey.
Yes.
It's a collection of minigames.
But you can get the alternate ending.
Ah.
Where everyone dies.
Wasn't that what happened?
Oh, he just got shot.
The original ending.
All right.
So here we are.
This is the list we have so far.
Next up is the elimination round.
We have Labyrinth.
Showgirls, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Orgasmo, Pink Flamingos, Kill Bill, The Oral Adventures of Kraven Moorhead, Trick, Battle Royale, Cheerleader Ninjas, and Clerks.
Jamie, what has to come off this list?
Showgirls.
I'm sorry, but I don't see how that could be made into a game.
Jamie.
You're killing me.
Unless it played like the Spice Girls game, which sucks.
You're killing me, Jamie.
It could be a dance game.
They would never be able to do it justice.
You're right.
You're right.
They could never do it justice.
You're right.
Thank you.
I'm okay with that pick now, Jamie.
Okay.
Loki, your turn to take something off the list.
Here comes Loki.
Here comes Loki.
A glass of something.
Is that blood?
Yes, the blood of all fruit.
It's tropical punch blood.
Okay, anyways.
Loki, what's coming off the list?
Pink Flamingos Ew, bitch That's gone I like the idea of Trick as a survival horror game Or like a stealth game Pink Flamingos, I can't see that Alright, you bastard You know what?
I'm sorry, but The Oral Adventures of Kraven Moorhead It's way too obscure I'm letting Cheerleader Ninjas slip by, for God's sake Cheerleader Ninjas would own The Oral Adventures of Kraven Moorhead is just a little too out there
It's a little too out there, so I'm going to have to take that off.
Okay, so here's what's left, you guys.
I get to read it.
You get to read it.
I get to post it first.
And when I post it, you guys can send your vote.
You're only going to vote for your favorite, and we will somehow come up with a top three out of this.
So if you wouldn't mind, Jamie, take it away.
Labyrinth, Rocky Horror Picture Show.
Maybe tell us a little bit about each movie that you know.
I'll fill in if you don't know.
Labyrinth is David Bowie in tight spandex.
Oh yeah, and some chick asked to rescue her little brother anyway.
Who was it that played her?
Jennifer Connelly.
Yeah, Jennifer Connelly.
I hope, just sorry to interrupt, but I hope Zex and Chad is listening because there is nothing better in this world than Labyrinth for him.
Labyrinth is, okay, I picked up the Superbit edition.
I think he would come, if he's listening, I know he's going to come in the chat room for once just to vote for that.
Well, I hope he cleans up after himself.
Um, next up, Rocky Horror Picture Show.
Tim Curry.
Best singing voice ever.
The tattoo.
And the guy grunting.
Um, anyway.
Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
Coconuts.
Unladen Swallow.
What is the aspect of a Steven Unladen Swallow?
Was it African Swallow or European Swallow?
I don't know!
Ah!
Anyway.
Next up, Orgasma.
Shoot a gun, get sticky pants.
Cock Rocket.
Cock Rocket.
And what was the guy's name who ran the sushi bar?
Sushi Fresh?
Or something?
G Fresh.
It's all about G Fresh.
Kill Bill.
Uma Thurman with a sword and being able to do wire work.
That was really impressive.
Kuriyama Chiaki as Gogo Yubari with her swinging ball of doom.
And Sunny Chippa speaking very bad English.
Your Japanese is good!
Anyway.
Trick?
Fuck if I know.
It's about two gay guys who are trying to find a place to screw.
I was making it up.
Oh, okay.
Oh, fuck if I know.
I get it.
Okay, fuck, yeah, okay.
Battle Royale, Dead Children.
And Beat Takeshi.

Yes, Death by Cocksucking.
And The Airplane Story.
Alright, while those votes come in, we're going to take our last break of the night.
Any requests for what we're going to do this break?
We want to do the anothers this break, right?
Okay, we're going to do the anothers.
So, thank you Zodiac Knight for saving my ass and sending this song to me.
Here it is.
Enjoy during this break while we tally the listless votes for a movie that you would most like to see a video game made out of.
The definitive list, coming back when we come back.
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
and more.
Thanks for watching!
From StepSquad to OrangeLabs, this DDR sucks!
Holla, Holla, Holla!
GGPO!
Hello, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
I know the suspense is killing you, but here it is, the definitive list as decided by us, Loki, DarkSakura, and Skye.
And a little help from the chat room.
www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.
Alright, here it is.
The top three movies you would like to see made into a game.
Number three, Kill Bill.
A lot of people when they were voting said, you know, I was going to vote for Kill Bill, but I think they're going to make that into a game anyway.
You guys are probably right.
I would say on this entire list, Kill Bill is the one I think is most likely going to be a game, if anything.
We'll see.
But Tarantino is such a big nerd that I could see it happening.
But Kill Bill is your number three pick.
But there were two films on this list you want to see even more than Kill Bill.
and number two is Clerks.
Clerks the game.
Yep, so you guys want to just be lazy in your video games as well as your real life, I guess, because there wouldn't be a lot to do in Clerks the game.
The animated series will be fun, I think.
So there it is, Clerks the Game.
And your number one pick, I think this is pretty much a no-brainer, you guys, Battle Royale the Game.
Best, I mean, this could be a Doom killer right here.
Fuck Quake, fuck Doom, Battle Royale would be where it's at.
I don't know, somebody should make a Quake mod.
I talked to someone who was actually trying to do one in Counter-Strike, but of course it wasn't really going to work.
Well, there you go.
The list has decided by you and us.
There's no disputing it.
That is it.
That's the list of movies that most need to be a game.
Okay, so now that we're back, Loki, we haven't even really referenced this yet in the show, but Loki would like to share with you this new game he downloaded this week.
And, Loki, you want to tell us a little more about this?
Yeah.
First off, the chair is being attacked by the microphone cords again.
Maybe that should be a movie or a game.
Attack of the Killer Microphone Court.
You okay there?
Need some help?
You gonna make it?
You're just in the middle of traffic, I think, is what happens to it.
I was the one sitting in it.
I didn't do anything.
She was spinning around and around and around.
Okay.
You okay, Loki?
You gonna make it?
Are you going to be okay?
Alright, he's ready.
He's ready to tell you all about the game.
I am safe.
Okay.
This game is this company's answer to DDR.
Yes, this game will take the world by storm and you will never know what DDR is.
You'll just go, oh my god, this game rocks.
At least that's what they would like to think.
This game is called Tap-A-Jam.
Tap-A-Jam.
and Tapajam is, well, it's interesting.
Tapajam loading.
And what wonderful songs can you expect in Tapajam?
Well, let's see.
It's all public domain music.
So, we have wonderful songs like Cannon and Bee, Flight of the Bumblebee,
Wow, these are top quality songs, you guys.
Moonlight Sonata.
Blue Danube.
Danube.
Simon Says Disco Fingers.
Who knows what that is?
And more shit.
Oh, and Chopsticks.
Yes, Chopsticks.
And you can see Loki and I are so mature when we play at our high score table.
Ass is in first place and cunts in second place.
Because we're so mature.
Okay.
So now we're going to show the game here.
We'll get Jamie's reaction.
And I'll describe it for our listeners.
Basically... Oh, man, you changed the... Oh, I changed the controls.
Sorry, guys.
Ah.
Basically, you have this up, down, left, right arrow, but it's on the left side of the screen.
So we've had, you know, we've had DDRs at the top, Beat Manias at the bottom.
Well, now we have a game where it's on the left side of the screen.
And so you have the up, left, right, and down arrows.
It's left, Loki.
That one's left.
And then right and down.
And as the notes scroll over to the left, you have to hit them when they come in this column, is the way this works.
Okay, what happened to my mouse?
There it goes.
Okie dokie.
And what website can they download this from, Loki?
It's that, like, game... If they would really want to?
It's like a game house is what's at... Just do a search for Tapa Jam.
It's like... Oh my god, beatbox bonus feature!
I didn't see this before!
Oh, a beatbox bonus feature, huh?
Oh, it's... Just go to the game.
It's like a music generator, just gay.
Alright, so he's going to play this.
And it even has a little wavelength in the bottom of the screen.
So it's like instead of pretty videos, you get waves like Winamp.
Listen to Loki make that sweet music.
Okay.
Aren't you happy?
Doesn't this game make you just go in that base?
I feel like breaking down.
Come on.
Jamie, your thoughts?
This is shit.
Actually, combo.
Oh my god.
I think this is an interesting way to get around having to license any song.
They just put in a bunch of classical songs.
That's a pretty smart idea.
Hey, we like our classical songs, don't we?
But I think we like our classical songs better when the renditions don't suck ass.
when they're played by an orchestra and not some $2 Casio keyboard from Walmart.
So if you've ever wanted to play Beatmania in the comfort of your own home, go buy a Beatmania machine.
Do not settle for this shit.
This is sort of like a guitar freak show.
Oh, Loki failed Chopsticks!
It's because I'm running the camera software, it's like, the notes are on one side of the screen, and I was like, jump.
If you thought Night Style had bad lag, try playing Tapper Jam with the camera.
But anyways, yeah, this game sucks.
But isn't this interesting?
This ties into what we were talking about last week.
We were talking about, you know, oh, this Into the Groove thing is going to get its pantsuit off it because it's copying Konami.
Well shit, this is a blatant ripoff of Beatmania if I've ever seen one.
I mean, they've differed it enough, but it's still, it's shit.
It's not even a good ripoff.
This sounds like shit.
Stop broadcasting this shit on the radio.
We have little enough listeners as it is.
Alright, fine.
Oh, I only get seven more sessions.
They only limit me to ten.
I think I'm going to go be violent.
Oh, it's at GameHouse.com.
That's where you can find it at.
And what other games do they have?
Somebody posted a link in our chat room.
Tiger posted that for you guys.
Yeah, lame.
This is what happens when people start making... This is what, if they have problems licensing music, if we're into the groove, this is what it's going to be like.
Yeah, we're going to have MIDI-sounding classical pieces, and we'll get to dance to Chopsticks and the Big Anub.
Play the one song real quick that I... What song?
This is Utopia.
This is one of the songs that's going to be into the group.
Sure, go for it.
And I didn't really like it that much, but, you know.
All right, we'll let our listeners judge for themselves.
This is by Ka, which is Gil's new name, if I'm not mistaken.
And Smiley is the name that he's under for this one.
You know, he's doing the Naoki thing.
How cute.
And, well, here it is.
All right, judge for yourself.
Here's Utopia from into the group.
I always think of the Madonna song.
Okay, come on.
I can't get away from being Madonna-ish.
Wow, okay, that was Utopia by Ka, Smiley, Keel, whatever the name is.
It's a song that's going to be an into the groove.
You guys' thoughts?
Loki, I know you already said you didn't like it, so I thought we'd see Jamie's thoughts.
Jamie's curled up in a little ball going to sleep, so you don't think you'd want to dance to that one, Jamie?
No, not much.
I think you guys are being a little hard on it.
I think it's a good song.
The problem is, okay, it's a good song, but...
It's badly produced.
And I'm not blaming the author for this because I think he's very talented and he's writing good music.
I think he's just probably very limited in what he's able to write because he probably only has so much equipment, you know, whatever.
But I think with an actual recording studio, if this guy worked for Konami, I think the song would be sweet.
I think it would have the better sampling.
I think you were exactly right when you said it sounds like a MIDI.
I think the sampling he's using is not good.
It's kind of a poor choice.
The piano sounds a little too MIDI-ish to me.
I think if he had the right equipment, it would be a kick-ass song.
I think if it were better produced, basically, is what it is.
I think it's a good song, badly produced.
I just don't think that it suits a dancing game.
It just doesn't seem like something I would enjoy playing.
It's a good song.
I just don't think I'd enjoy playing it.
It's actually, I almost see it more as like a 2DX song, in a way.
I think if it were more... It's funny you should mention that, because it's like a 12-footer in this damn game, so the steps are like 2DX.
You know what?
See, that's just going to ruin the song even more, to throw it away on these 12-footers and stuff.
I mean, that's just... It's stupid.
There's no need for it.
Come on.
Why don't you have a couple 11-footers to kill people?
But stick to fun steps.
That song could have some fun steps.
I think that song could have some really fun steps.
What they were saying is they have a maniac level or whatever, and already 10 of the songs have 11 and 12-footer steps.
I think the problem is people think that the way they can squeeze more life out of DDR is to make it harder.
And it's just kind of like, you know what, the human body is going to reach a point.
And there's a point where it's just not going to be fun for the rest of us anymore.
You're making the game to satisfy the 1% of people who could pass Max Period on the first try.
I'm sorry, but in my eyes, Max Period is no fun at all.
It's a bad DDR song because it's no fun at all.
Speeding a song up to 600 beats per minute at the end, that's stupid.
It's inhuman and undoable.
It's just...
It's too bad.
And the song sucks.
That's a big factor.
If they're going to do hard ones, the song at least needs to be good.
Okay.
Well, any other thoughts on this?
Any other thoughts on Into the Groove, Tapajam, any other DDR knockoffs we need to address while we're here?
I'm just thinking that we can do it way better.
And like I said, I'm going to take my attempt at it, so we'll work on it.
As I said last week, I'm going to try pushing that and seeing if an arcade will take my idea.
I'm just saying, you could do it a lot better than what you're doing right now.
Whatever.
But that's fine.
I mean, I understand that they have their, you know, limitations with going the legal route, but, you know, a lot of people don't care about the legal route.
That's why the DVR machines are here, so... That's the way you gotta look at it.
Joe Mama wanted to make a point, kind of defending Max's period a little bit, I guess, or whatever, playing Devil's Advocate.
How many people play Max 300 on 2-speed, he says, because that's just as bad as 600 beats per minute.
Honestly, I've seen one or two.
I've not seen that many people that brave it on 2-speed.
I mean, some people do it for the challenge.
But I don't really see it as something practical.
Most people that do it on 2-speed honestly haven't memorized.
They've played it so goddamn hard.
Here's the thing is, people don't like BPM-doubled songs.
Songs that, you know, the steps are going quite... Yeah, because honestly, max 300 is only supposed to be 150 beats per minute.
Yeah, I mean, we understand that, and same with Dropout.
Dropout's the same way, and I understand they go with the bass line on it, and they do, you know, the bass line goes in eighth notes or whatever for max period, not one point, and that's why it goes 600.
But the only reason, the steps for Max period aren't that hard, it's just so hard to read.
It's just stupid.
And the steps in the beginning are stupid too, because it's just jumping.
It's tons of jumping.
No one likes that.
It's just retarded.
That's true.
A lot of stepfiles in Tournament XIV got reamed for that.
Right?
Too many weird jokes and stuff.
If that were a stepfile in Tournament XIV, they would be bitching.
It wouldn't have even made it into the final.
It would just be laughed off as, like, first off, being a horrible Max remix.
And two, they would have been like, oh, well, this is the stepfile for it.
It's stupid.
Why did you double the BPM at the very end?
That's retarded.
They would have laughed at that thing.
I don't even know why they did that.
I don't really think they know what they're doing as far as sim files go.
I don't think they know what they're doing.
I don't think they know what their customers want.
And so they're looking at sim files, unfortunately looking at really shitty ones, and they're like, well, people like this, so this is what they're doing.
It just doesn't make any sense.
Okay, I guess at this point now, we'll open it up for final thoughts of the evening, because that's about it.
Actually, I did want to say though, Jamie, have a safe trip, fly safe, have fun in Alabama, have twice as much fun for me, three times as much, see, Loki's covered too, because California's going to suck.
I know, it'll suck until I get back.
Now, I'll have a good time.
You know, I'm going to see my family.
Hope they don't drive me completely insane by the time I get back.
But, and I'm going to have, I'm going to have Ma and Chad with me.
So, flying sort of parallel flights.
So, we're going to have lots of hanging out time.
So, it's a girls trip out to Alabama.
That should be fun.
All right, final thoughts of the evening.
I was just thinking, kind of a question to pose to the chat room.
Sure.
If you were to, like, say, go to your normal arcade, you've got, like, you know, your DVR Extreme has been there forever, and say it was upgraded with something that was homemade, but not necessarily, like, you know, into the group where it's its own things.
Like, say someone put Step Mania on there and put, like, a bunch of, like, you know, the old tracks and some of the new tracks.
Would you be that, like, against it if it was, like, a pretty decent collection of songs?
Are you going to be all pissed off that it's just, you know, it's an independent software and not an official Konami thing?
Or are you just going to be like, you know, hey, this is cool?
Because that's what I'm getting at.
I'm just trying to see if people would be so pissed off at having, like, a well put together set of songs.
But not official.
I mean, because this is into the group stuff.
If it was a well put together set of songs, it might be alright, but I don't know.
Just a little question to throw around there and discuss.
Alright, well.
Let's go around and get final thoughts, and we'll see if there's any answers to that when we get back.
Somebody wanted to share their final thought with us.
Somebody who's going by the nickname of Skywhore, thank you, thanks, that's great, says their final thought is that 2DX has met its match with Tapajam.
Have another bud, buddy.
A. You're my whore for Christ's sake.
B. No.
2DX has met its match with the... I would love to see a mix of songs, like to do just kind of like an independent thing.
Have the artists from 2DX and have like some of the homebrew artists.
Have some of the homebrew artists fight against each other, like kind of a DJ battle type thing.
Because there's a lot of homebrew artists out there that make really kick-ass songs and animations that go with them.
All right.
Well, I'm looking to see in the chat room if there's any response to your hypothetical question to them, and there is not.
Nobody cares.
So I guess it's time to end the show.
Loki, your final thought?
My final thought is I better get working on my show this week so I don't have to do it the same day as I usually do.
Tune in what day?
Wednesday.
What time?
It'll be at 7.
Sounds good.
Jamie, your final thought?
I have to get up at 4 in the fucking morning.
Oh, I'm sorry, final thought.
Don't forget, my show's going to be on Monday, and Tuesday I'm going to be on a plane, so just hope that I don't die or something.
And that's it.
I don't miss you all!
Um, my final thought is, um, I have nothing more to say.
That's it.
Jamie, you're going to have to word tonight because I know you enjoy always getting the word and you're going to be gone for a couple weeks, so here you go.
Here we go.
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
We expect you a nice play again.
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
Well, I object to all this sex on the television.
I mean, I keep falling off.
thanks for listening and we'll see you next week
Orange Lounge Radio, The Afterbirth, the part after the credits have crawled across the screen, and everything you think has come to an end, but it's still going.
Loki, you did finally get some feedback to your hypothetical situation you posed.
Okay.
I think, Zodiac Knight says, I think the potential for any DDR homebrew lies in the song selection.
Okay.
Sounds good.
Zodiac Knight also says, I would take a look at it at least.
Give it a try.
The thing I'm concerned about is I want to do this, and I think we might have the potential to actually put it in the arcade, but I'm thinking people are going to go and see it, and they're going to go on DDR free and go, oh my god, I saw this in the arcade, and people are getting pissed off, and I'm bitching about that.
It's kind of ironic that the people that like the game so much would actually ruin it for themselves.
Interesting thought.
Pixie Dust says, I suck at DDR, but I'd still try it.
Okay.
Because, like I said... So I think everybody's kind of like, okay, I'll try it.
I'll try it once.
I'll try it once, twice if I like it.
Three times to be sure.
Three times to be sure, exactly.
Okay.
Well, if they had good music, then I suppose it would take off and work.
So that's what I'll have to work on.
I'll have to work on it.
You should use my evil edits.
Nostylan says he's going to miss you, Jamie.
And he's going to miss Pump Up the Volume as well.
Well, it'll still be playing.
You'll get to hear some of the old ones.
And, you know, maybe the Tuesday night I get back, if I'm not, like, dead to the world, I'll toss on some Eurobeat for you.
I have a couple things I was going to be planning.
LiveWire for the 19th of November.
I'm going to have to do something special for that.
Some Bomani-related thing.
And then, what was it?
Also, I think, I don't know, might try to do something special for New Year's.
I don't know, depending on what I'm doing.
We should do something on New Year's.
What day is New Year's?
I do something every New Year's though.
Yeah, I'm thinking if anything runs on New Year's it's going to be taped because I don't want to be here.
We always do an anime marathon and get really drunk.
Yeah, I'm thinking I want to go out and get wasted because I didn't get to do it for Halloween so I'm going to be doing it for New Year's.
You can come get wasted with me, Loki.
Come on.
Drunk Rob is awesome, isn't it?
Drunk Rob is funny, Mr. Piñata.
I got called by somebody drunk last night three times.
I won't embarrass them on the air by saying who it is, but it was really funny.
It was great.
And he called today to apologize.
I'm like, you don't have to apologize.
You're funny.
This is cool.
So, it was funny.
Drunk people are hilarious.
You know what?
What?
You've seen me get drunk.
But I don't think I'm funny when I'm drunk, because it doesn't last.
You've been funny when you're drunk.
How?
I've seen you be funny when you're drunk.
I go around giving other people drinks because I want them to be as drunk as me.
People are calling on the phone, not realizing we're trying to do a show in this house.
Yeah, he's doing a radio show.
Who's the goober that called?
Yeah, I can have him call you.
Alright, bye.
Who was the goober that called?
That was Matt, so you can yell at him.
Goober!
Oh, you're still doing that?
Yeah, we are.
www.DarkSakura.com
But the way we've been counting, 69 is coming up in a couple weeks.
Those were half episodes.
Yeah.
It's so weird, you guys.
I can remember back to the first episode.
When we hit 100, we need to be really, really quick.
Well, I already said when we hit 100, I'm quitting.
No, we're not going to quit.
We're going to keep going.
All right, we'll keep going.
We're going to be geriatric.
PC Dust wants to take me to L.A.
for New Year's.
I'm down with that.
I want to go far away for New Year's.
I want to travel.
I want to have money and travel.
That's what I'm going to do.
Yeah, but I want a cookie, but I can't have that.
All right.
Your post-show tonight is going to be a recycled pre-show, one of Jamie's old pre-shows, and it's one I like.
So I've decided that that's going to be tonight's post-show.
Oh, and which one, pray tell.
It is the one with all the Svensson and Ghislaine mixes.
Oh, that one was fun.
Yes, it was.
Oh, wait, now I'm curious.
Now, before I get into the post-show, somebody says, Joe Mama says, the first episodes were fun.
Did we jump the shark or something?
What's wrong with the recent episodes?
I think this is like a fine wine we've improved with age.
I don't know, I've been noticing that... Or like a mold's gotten bigger.
I've been less bitter lately.
It's just like, I get to Sunday and I'm already relaxed.
I'll be angry all throughout the week and then I just kind of calm down on the weekend.
It's not because I'm getting laid more or anything, it's just because... I don't know, it's just calming.
I'm the only one not getting laid, I should be the bitter one.
But even when I wasn't, I was, I mean, even when I was, I was still getting, I was still bitter.
It's just like, I think I don't go out enough and get, like, people pissing me off enough.
Or it's the same people pissing me off, so it's like, eh, been there.
So, has Orange Lounge Radio jumped the shark yet, you think?
Or you think we still got a ways to go?
No, but I'm very scared to think of 23 Magus with a man's slut.
Well now.
Oh, I see.
Joe Mama is thinking back to those days when only like six people frequented our chat room during the shows.
And we just didn't give a fuck.
And guess what?
You still don't give a fuck.
Yeah, I mean, the number of people has never been that important to us.
I mean, because obviously if we were numbers, we don't get that many people in retrospect to listen to the show.
But in internet radio terms...
Quite a few, actually.
Quite a few for an internet radio show, which is very good.
We are loved.
And we have all you guys to thank.
And it just keeps getting bigger.
Every week I see new faces coming into the chatroom.
It's awesome.
It's awesome.
And we love you guys.
I'm sorry that you haven't gotten laid.
That's Pixie Dust.
I know.
I'm sorry that she hasn't gotten laid.
You come over, pixie dust, I'll show you good times.
You know what, people... I'll show your boobs some lovin'.
People don't need to get laid to be happy.
They don't.
Some people are perfectly happy being asexual.
But, but, but, getting laid definitely, like, takes the little, like, hyper dog out of you, you know?
It's just like... You know what this may be?
And to be honest, I can think of a few people that could use a little mellowing.
I'm sorry.
You know what?
I'm sorry that getting laid just does one thing for me.
It makes me want ice cream.
That's it.
Just remember.
Yes, could I order vanilla cream with an orgasm mix-in?
No, come back here and make your comment on there.
That was great.
That was brilliant.
Just remember, without sex, Ben and Jerry's wouldn't be doing so well.
Orange Cream, anyone?
What else am I thinking of here?
Vanilla Chunk?
I don't know.
It had something to do with this show, but I guess it wasn't that bad.
Trainwreck!
I know what it is.
I know what it is.
No, it actually has nothing to do with this show.
It has to do with getting laid, which is even better than this show.
It has to do with this show.
You know what?
Some people don't need to get laid.
Some people just want to cuddle.
Aww.
There's a funny line in Boondock Saints where they're talking about cuddling.
Because the one cop who's the perfect investigator, and he's a gay guy, but he acts like a straight guy.
It's kind of weird.
It's like this guy's trying to cuddle with him.
He's like, what the fuck you want?
You want to cuddle?
He's like, man, you're so gay.
And then he gets up and walks away.
That was funny.
All right, let's get it.
All right.
I hope you've had your fill.
All right.
That's it.
We're going to go into post-show now.
It's Spencer McGeehan music.
Started off with a little bit of Ayumi Hamasaki, huh?
We'll depend on you.
I can't wait to mute these microphones.
Say goodbye to the ferrets, Jamie.
They're coming with me.
You can't take them back.
You'll never see.
Oh, wait.
I have to take them back.
If you ever leave, when that day comes, we'll be together from there.
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!
I want to die to the light of the ocean of love I want to die to the light of the ocean of love
