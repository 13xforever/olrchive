10092	14233	Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
17836	20397	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
20697	22718	Romani Talk and then some.
23398	26119	Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.
26479	30481	Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.
31121	35903	Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.
36483	40184	You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
40525	42005	Yes, I will spank your child.
42405	44126	If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.
48922	50983	Well, here's to my big opening.
51504	52644	A sphincter says what?
52664	54906	I'm super, thanks for asking.
55286	57888	Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.
57928	61190	What am I doing here?
61210	61490	No.
61770	63091	Dodge this.
63552	65433	This is a tasty burger.
65673	68135	Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.
68355	69015	Yes, I have.
69435	71217	Look, it's a flesh wound.
71437	77601	Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie.
78627	79348	Oh yeah?
79568	82870	Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.
83130	84191	DarkSakura.
84371	85212	I've got a sniff.
85532	86072	Skye.
86172	88254	But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.
88634	89174	Loki.
89415	90435	I hate you!
90836	92977	Orange Lounge Radio.
94738	96460	We are live.
98161	100182	And this is episode number 69.
103470	112272	for November the 16th of 2000 and wait for it, wait for it, three.
114912	121453	You're tuned in to the Bimani scenes most sexually charged for 99 cents a minute.
122553	128074	Radio station of all things between my legs and Bimani.
129714	131415	My name is Rob Roberts.
131615	132655	You might know me as
133744	134964	Soft Bunny Lips.
136945	139845	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.
140785	148807	In this corner, the most heterosexual tech boy on the farm, Mr. Loki.
150127	151287	He's a breast man.
154788	155568	Yeah.
157928	160249	Hey, look at me.
160449	161469	I'm acting so...
171972	181736	Also joining me tonight, well, she's not here, but she's somewhere being naughty.
182196	184577	It's Miss Jamie Summers.
184997	188739	She's off in Alabama being very, very naughty.
191042	201369	So in her place tonight, we have a whole orgy of people, starting with the one and only Orange Lounge Madam.
202429	204911	Say hello to Pixie Dust.
205671	206071	Hi.
206992	208693	I want to fuck your brains out.
208873	209314	Oh yeah.
209614	209754	Oh!
210453	211233	Fuck yeah!
211573	217015	No, it's infamous for me coming, being the Orange Lounge Madam, being on show 69 of all things.
217755	218916	Yeah, whatever.
219176	227959	Also joining us for this monumentally huge episode 69, say hello to Nurse Tylan.
229199	230980	Hi, I'm really sexy, am I?
231300	233601	I just broke the queue.
234101	234461	Thank you.
235815	243098	Also joining us, straight from heaven, oh God, oh God, it's DDR Angel.
243678	245779	Bunnies have friends with tricks.
248360	253342	Also with us tonight, say hello to the 69th Magus.
255102	259664	So, put your vibrators on autopilot and enjoy the ride.
261765	264006	Haha, even after you add more numbers, you're still not funny.
264066	264646	Yeah!
265874	267576	There's no turning back now!
267796	273981	Alright, in all seriousness tonight, this is the episode we've been looking forward to for a long time, episode number 69.
274121	283049	So, you know, we had to do something for it, because it was kind of starting to feel anticlimactic, you know, with Jamie not here, unfortunately, and just... Yeah, yeah.
283830	290656	The one thing that's not going to be climactic tonight... I don't think anybody in that corner of the room is going to be climaxing anything today.
290676	292638	I've got to plug the cord in the hole.
293564	296506	Stick that cord, stick that network cord in somebody's hole.
296566	296906	Do it.
297326	297906	Do it, Loki.
297946	298307	Do it.
300168	302529	Ooh, ViolentHyperGirl's going to come out here and she's going to bring her whip.
302809	303429	I'll bring mine.
303750	305451	In all seriousness, we're not crazy.
305511	307131	There is going to be other stuff to talk about tonight.
307152	308552	We have a whole lot of stuff to talk about.
309533	311334	There's DDR Ultra Mix coming out soon.
311654	312174	How was your week?
312214	312815	How was your day?
312835	317237	We have plenty to talk about when it comes to Final Fantasy XI, RekkaCon, and all that fun stuff.
318278	320659	And all sorts of interesting things and...
321388	323449	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
347469	347969	Right now.
348269	349030	Very naked.
349110	351891	And I have to say, you have such nice breasts, Pixie Dust.
351931	353212	You have very lovely breasts.
353512	353872	Thank you.
354553	355653	You're very welcome.
355753	356173	And plants.
358014	359315	Alright, we're going to start this off.
359335	364377	We're going to take a quick break with some music from Dancing Stage Fever, the new game that came out in Europe not too long ago.
364458	366138	Some classic songs in there.
366158	372622	You may have heard some of these tunes before, but now, if you're in Europe or you have a way of playing Dancing Stage Fever, you can play these songs.
372802	373242	We'll be back.
406358	407518	Okay, we're going to have to can that.
407558	408398	I don't know what's going on.
408478	411739	It's stopping going there, so let's see here.
411779	413599	What I'll do is I'll copy the files over real fast.
413619	414380	We'll do it a different way.
415080	416760	Something weird's running with the network right now.
417140	421962	In the meantime, PastyDust will do her 900 operator impersonation for you.
423362	424242	Ring, ring, ring, ring.
424782	425202	Hello.
425903	426363	Hi.
427283	428263	What's your name, little boy?
428903	431064	My name is Loki.
431144	431424	Loki.
433956	434936	What are you into, little boy?
435977	438317	I'm into sex and big things.
439418	440858	What kind of big things, Loki?
441378	441859	Breasts.
444279	445180	What do you like about them?
446360	447461	They're bouncy.
449821	450402	You're pathetic.
450442	451002	Get off my line.
451022	455303	Flick!
455523	456724	Yeah, something weird's going on.
456744	460665	The network's running really slow today, so I'm not able to run things off the network very well.
462873	464835	Yeah, it's because we have a lot of stuff going through our network right now.
464895	467117	So, sorry, guys.
468939	469279	That's all right.
469299	469780	We'll be okay.
475825	484514	If you want to join our chat room and join in the big orgy that's going on in there, head on over to our website, www.callybimani.com.
485054	487837	Click on Orange Lounge and click on Chat.
490309	503947	and okay in this break we're going to hear it starting off with Asa Bass with All That She Wants will be the first song we hear from Dancing Stage Fever and then some more stuff that you may or may not recognize so okay now that it's copied over to my drive let's try this again we'll be right back
701494	703716	I say, the boys are back in town
742953	747098	The boys are back in town again Just hanging down at Dino's
778348	779949	Hi, this is Mel B of RTF.
780309	785191	And for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join us on all the fun together.
786051	792014	Hey, if you're a broke ass like I am, why don't you come to one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.
792334	794235	It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights.
794795	799197	Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.
800436	804198	Alright, we are back, Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 69, in progress.
804638	810220	I like that promo because Mel's kind of, you know, she's a, and for an extra 99 cents a minute, he gets into it too, so.
810620	811421	Oh, yeah.
811481	812221	I had to bring that in.
812661	827948	And by the way, for those of you guys that have played Karaoke Revolution yet, once you guys unlock the song one week, we haven't done it here yet because I've been lazy and I haven't played Karaoke Revolution all week, but once you unlock the song one week, apparently you get a video with it, and in that video, Mel makes a cameo.
829195	832797	I guess it's all these different people singing the song or something like that, and he's in it.
833237	835458	So be on the lookout for that.
835558	835958	Yes, Angel?
836859	841341	Actually, my friend is actually in the game.
841661	843842	He actually did voice for the game.
844362	845082	Oh, that's cool.
845102	846023	His name is Bert.
846627	847067	What did he sing?
847248	848348	I only know his first name.
848368	849429	Do you know what he sang in it?
849569	850390	Eagle Eye Cherry Song.
850830	851151	The what?
851311	851991	The Eagle Eye Cherry Song.
852011	852552	Oh, Safe Tonight?
852892	854974	Hey, I can get a good score on that one.
855614	856815	Maybe because Bert's helping, you see.
857116	861859	Maybe if we get bored the last segment, we could fire up Karaoke Revolution and see who's an all-star here.
861879	863200	Because I haven't seen it yet.
863761	864602	Maybe, maybe.
864642	866523	We'll see how desperate for material we get.
866583	866903	We'll see.
866963	867264	Desperate?
867284	868265	Who says we're ever desperate?
869726	870707	It's episode 69.
870747	871948	We're very, very desperate.
871968	873889	Speaking of desperate, hey, Andrew, how are you doing?
877037	878638	Wonderful.
879479	880900	I ain't desperate for nothing.
882241	882901	Oh, really?
882921	884362	Anyway, how about a good joke?
888145	894430	All right, in that break, during... In that break, we played a bunch of stuff from Dancing Sage Fever... Fever?
894610	895150	Fee-ger?
895670	896051	Fever!
897011	900074	Dancing Sage... Feces, yes.
900154	900454	Yes.
901551	912678	and in Dancing Stage Faces, that's a joke for you Sacramento people, in Dancing Stage Faces we have Asa Bass with All That She Wants, Dexy's Midnight Runners with Come On Eileen and Thin Lizzy with The Boys Are Back In Town.
913178	917661	And maybe later on in the show we'll play some of the less good tracks from it, so we'll see.
917801	918862	I came on Eileen.
920043	921023	What'd you say, Loki?
921324	922364	I came on Eileen.
922765	924366	Well, the song did say come on Eileen.
924386	924846	All right.
928190	936597	I figure, even though it's episode number 69, I figured we'd start the show off as we always do, with a little bit of, how was your day, how was your week?
938119	940721	So let's go around and see how everybody's day and their week was.
940941	944124	I will start tonight, because I never start this segment off, so I'm going to start.
945265	950269	Yesterday was the one and only, for those of you in NorCal, Wreck-A-Con.
951221	957364	Which is a small convention they did at a community college for anime and video games and all that dorky fun stuff.
957384	961786	And they did this at a community college in Pittsburgh, California, which is in the East Bay.
962346	965508	And this was my very first anime convention.
967649	971431	And Pixie Dust just had her period right through her pants.
972311	973212	That is amazing.
973272	974632	What the hell did you do, Pixie Dust?
975373	975933	Give her a mic.
975953	976393	Give her a mic.
977814	978835	Oh, that's definitely sweet.
978855	979635	The power's off.
981688	983068	Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!
983128	984329	That wasn't even a joke.
984749	985449	Did you catch that?
985469	987569	He just made another nonsense joke.
987689	988790	So it's not really that great.
990270	991850	It just looks like it was a painting, so it's okay.
992050	998232	It just looks like... It just looks like she got rammed so hard that she's bleeding right now.
998772	1000192	We won't talk about last night, Rob.
1001792	1007093	Well, they missed by a long shot, because that's your thigh, and nowhere near where it needs to be.
1008474	1009714	Well, right here, you know...
1010965	1012566	Anyway, RekkaCon, hello.
1013527	1016289	I think we have people listening today that actually went to RekkaCon yesterday.
1016349	1018410	So hello to all our new listeners that were at RekkaCon yesterday.
1018850	1025775	Because I whored out the station and the business cards and Jahi, bless his little heart, let me get on the mic and kind of plug things too.
1025795	1026696	So that was very nice of him.
1026756	1027336	Thank you, Jahi.
1028657	1030158	So, what did you guys think of RekkaCon?
1030178	1030858	Did you guys have a good time?
1030878	1031999	What kind of stuff did you guys do?
1032139	1034821	Anything you saw for the first time, got to play for the first time, things like that?
1035201	1035702	No styling?
1036042	1037143	I just walked around, man.
1037343	1037983	You just walked around?
1038003	1038844	You were just there for the people?
1038864	1038944	Yeah.
1040604	1041285	That's like me.
1041645	1042445	Basically, that's it.
1042625	1043186	That's like me.
1044186	1046788	There hasn't been any DDR tournaments in NorCal really lately.
1046808	1048949	There was one a couple weeks ago, but I couldn't go.
1049270	1053012	So this was kind of like a chance for me to see everybody because I haven't seen them in a long time.
1053652	1057375	Did you get to play any new interesting games or did you buy anything at the expo or anything like that?
1059696	1060637	Oh, it's completely broken.
1060657	1062778	I thought nothing was necessary.
1063038	1063739	Okay.
1065835	1067216	I have to ask, no milkshakes?
1067757	1068917	No, no milkshakes.
1069018	1069418	Oh, okay.
1070218	1070679	None at all.
1071019	1071399	None at all.
1071419	1074141	What the fuck?
1074201	1077324	I find that weird, you know, just everybody comes up to me and says milkshake.
1077624	1080046	Well, okay, I'm just going to say it.
1080346	1084229	Your online personality and your in-life personality are so different.
1084849	1087771	So, so different, no stylist.
1087831	1090013	I mean, not that it's a bad thing, I'm just saying.
1090753	1092735	Now it looks like I peed on myself since I tried to clean it up.
1096181	1098343	Why don't you hand the mic off to Angel over there?
1100145	1101326	Angel, what did you think of WreckerCon?
1102087	1102587	Sweet.
1102607	1104649	Did you get to play any new games for the first time or do anything?
1104669	1106631	That Tycho one.
1106691	1107371	Tycho no Tatooine?
1108292	1109593	The drum game?
1110614	1111075	I mean, hi.
1112636	1116440	I got to see the... Did somebody just say that Janae had a maxi period?
1119322	1120383	That was horrible.
1120644	1121204	Die.
1125712	1129634	Anyway, Angel, yesterday, Wreck-It-Con.
1133936	1134636	Let's see.
1134656	1138378	I almost brought Battle Royale manga, but I resisted.
1138398	1140819	Because you're poor.
1141479	1142820	I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.
1143767	1149788	Um, not really, but yeah, I mean, there's better things I should be saving for at the moment, so.
1150649	1152769	Um, yeah, so is life.
1153369	1153769	Excuse me.
1153969	1154369	That's cool.
1154849	1155209	Anyway.
1155510	1157390	Did you meet anybody new yesterday you hadn't met before?
1158350	1161811	Shahi, Mr. Wendell, obviously no style in.
1162911	1168512	Um, Iwonaoki2DX, StaplerX, let's see, I could go on and on.
1168932	1171733	Um, and a bunch of their friends who came over.
1173413	1175035	Dragon Quest Slime Morimori Adventures
1194414	1196496	Yes, the Dragon Quest with a real sword.
1196796	1197737	That game looked so sweet.
1197757	1198558	I didn't get a chance to play it.
1198578	1203363	It was the most popular thing in the game room, and everybody was kind of crowded around it, but it looked really cute.
1203844	1208328	I wanted to play it, but I love the way the enemies are drawn.
1208528	1211071	They updated all the enemies, like the slimes.
1211271	1213173	Well, not just cel-shaded, but they made them look sweet.
1213193	1215396	Yeah, the cel-shaded, the redone, it looks good.
1215456	1216577	It plays pretty well.
1217077	1218178	I was kind of surprised, though.
1218198	1225881	I was thinking that the Dragon Quest Sword game was going to be just like... Somebody had told me, oh, it's just the very first Dragon Quest, except you use a sword as a controller.
1225901	1226902	I was like, well, that's kind of weird.
1227222	1229103	But it's actually this whole new original game.
1229483	1233044	It kind of struck me as like a Super Scope game to me.
1233104	1235346	It looked a lot like a game you'd be playing with a Super Scope.
1236126	1239848	Like you'd be shooting the slimes, but instead you use the sword.
1243442	1243882	That was fun.
1244042	1244423	Good times.
1245023	1246783	We got to meet a lot of new faces.
1246943	1249604	Basically met everyone that Angel met.
1250024	1250264	Yep.
1251365	1252045	We had a good time.
1252305	1255266	We watched some AMVs in the video room.
1255286	1257586	What were some good music videos you guys saw?
1257726	1259607	The chibi things that kill.
1261287	1264308	A complete waste of 6 minutes and 45 seconds.
1264608	1264948	Okay.
1265669	1265789	And...
1268922	1276644	This one to In The Navy, where they started spoofing all these Battle Cruiser animes.
1277404	1277824	Interesting.
1278264	1278524	Okay.
1278844	1279204	Cool deal.
1280704	1282405	So yeah, Wreck-It-Con was just, it was great.
1282485	1283765	It was my first convention.
1283825	1288926	I've never been to any kind of anime or geek convention, really, ever, unless you count Rocky Horror Conventions.
1288966	1289646	Those are kind of geeky.
1290126	1293587	But actually, that's more of like a sex thing, because people get laid at those, except me.
1293607	1298408	But anyway, but ironically enough, a Rocky Horror Convention was the very first place I ever played DDR.
1299170	1309524	but anyway, that was my first non-RockyCon and good times, I just like getting to see people I don't know much about anime, I don't really watch a lot of it admittedly I'm one of those few DDR players that just
1310353	1317198	I've seen a couple Miyazaki films, and I watched Pokemon back when it was cool, but I haven't really gotten as into anime.
1317238	1318659	I kind of rely on Jamie for all that.
1318719	1321361	She's really into anime, and she just kind of tells me what's good and what's not.
1321721	1325643	And Loki, being the hookup, also knows some good and not good things.
1326044	1327685	But I saw a lot of great cosplayers.
1327705	1328946	There were some cute cosplayers.
1329206	1332788	There was a lot of Final Fantasy cosplayers, and I'm always a sucker for anything Final Fantasy.
1332808	1335130	And there were some X2 characters...
1335905	1340487	and there was a whole little group that had like a Squall and a Yuffie and all this stuff in it.
1340507	1341107	It was really cute.
1341748	1346950	And one thing that made me very happy is that there was a Mai.
1347130	1348871	Somebody came dressed as Mai from Final Fight.
1348911	1349551	So that made me happy.
1349611	1350792	Or not Final Fight, Fatal Fury.
1351052	1351632	That made me happy.
1352113	1353233	Because I love Mai.
1354694	1355874	Link was cool.
1356415	1359756	Oh yeah, they had not just one, but like two people dressed up as Link.
1359836	1361597	Actually, they had a Link and a Saria.
1363050	1391953	and later on they had like after the cosplay they had karaoke so we had like a guy dressed up as Zell singing Invoke rather well too and if you've ever been to an anime convention at all Ramen and Rice had shown up to this one as well oh my god now people tell me Ramen and Rice are at every single anime convention in the area so it's kind of like but this is the first time I saw them and I was like
1392353	1393574	They are so cool.
1393795	1396437	These girls play like everything on their violins.
1396718	1398219	I want to get some of their stuff for the station.
1398259	1400542	I should email, do some emails.
1400902	1404426	I'm a violinist myself, and they're awesome.
1404506	1406247	Oh, I would have thought you were a pianist.
1408390	1409090	No, but I have one.
1410912	1411473	Crap.
1412474	1413194	Be more funny.
1414376	1415056	Follow your advice.
1417222	1421504	Anyway, we wound up requesting, like, Butterfly and Scars of Time from Carameldansen.
1421724	1422044	Damn you!
1422064	1422225	Damn you!
1422245	1423705	You're the one that got them to play Butterfly.
1423745	1425086	Yes, I'm the one that got them to play Butterfly.
1425106	1426567	I hope you die, and you burn in hell.
1427867	1428248	Just kidding.
1428268	1429408	It's pretty hot in this room already.
1431049	1433610	Walked right into the pianist's quote, didn't you, Magus?
1435931	1439073	I would have given my left nut to hear them play Scars of Time.
1439113	1440654	I'm so sad I didn't stay around for that.
1440694	1441414	I bet it kicked ass.
1441434	1442715	Well, I did, and I still have mine.
1444053	1447855	I did hear them play some stuff from Final Fantasy X, though, which made me all horny, because it was great.
1448376	1454319	Well, uh, see, at the time they played Scars of Time, you hadn't gotten there yet, Mr. Fashionably Late.
1454359	1455760	Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, bitch.
1455820	1457741	I'm just kidding.
1457761	1458101	Love you.
1458642	1459562	Oh, really?
1460243	1461503	Let's take it outside.
1461523	1462024	In a good way.
1462284	1463424	Oh, really?
1464305	1464865	In a good way.
1464885	1464925	Um...
1469389	1474015	Wow, we have lots of new faces in our chat room tonight, so just hello to all our new chatters.
1474055	1476418	I see Captain Canada in here tonight, we haven't had him in a while.
1476678	1478160	Jahi's here tonight, hello.
1479481	1483366	It was so great seeing you with Kanye yesterday, and I see S-Ghost, somebody new I haven't seen before.
1484027	1486190	Violent Hypergirl's here, I haven't seen her in a long time.
1487591	1488412	and all sorts of people.
1489053	1490594	XVI, as he likes to be called.
1491175	1494018	Brandon, all these people I don't get to talk to too much.
1494358	1495679	But they're in the chat room tonight, so hello.
1495739	1497741	Head on over to www.cali.com.
1498262	1501986	Click on Orange Lounge and click on chat to join our chat room.
1504448	1505289	Jahi, by the way.
1506144	1508425	One of the greatest MCs I've ever seen.
1508785	1511107	I swear to God I want him to MC a DDR tournament.
1511367	1517650	Yesterday I would see him on the mic and people were breakdancing and stuff and he's sitting there going, you know, he's doing his thing.
1517710	1518971	I can't even impersonate it so great.
1518991	1519711	He's doing his thing.
1519891	1521752	And then like I come back an hour later and there he goes.
1521792	1523593	He's still going and he's into it.
1524113	1524634	He's a man.
1524714	1525114	He's a man.
1525854	1527275	You've got to come up and be on the show sometime.
1528320	1537022	Anyway, so also on How Was My Week, How Was My Day, something worth noting, talking about is this thing that I did on Thursday.
1538003	1543504	I got asked to promote Orange Lounge Radio in a way at this local high school.
1543624	1546505	I judged a local high school's American Idol style competition.
1547545	1550466	And it was very interesting.
1551026	1553007	I don't know if anybody from there is listening tonight.
1553047	1555047	Probably not because they only mentioned the station like twice.
1555067	1556608	I only gave out one business card to...
1557682	1574086	The guy who I thought was most talented out of everybody Mostly because he wrote his own music And it was fucking funny It was something like Adam Sandler would have done And I'm actually in talks with him right now Trying to get a song of his to spin on the show So you guys can see what I'm talking about But it was very interesting because it was
1574930	1582932	Me, and two interns from one of the local Sacramento stations, or I don't know, they work in the promotions department or something like that, and two teachers.
1583332	1594114	So it was supposed to be like all these local celebrities, and I was going to be like the nobody, but I ended up being the only one that actually was on a radio program of any kind, so that was kind of interesting.
1594754	1597755	I also ended up being the asshole judge, because I was the only one...
1598479	1601940	Willing to say anything remotely constructive about anybody.
1602261	1605962	Because everybody, all the other judges are like, Oh my God, you were so great.
1605982	1607123	You were just like Clay Aiken.
1607143	1608283	You're better than Clay Aiken.
1608423	1609223	Oh my God.
1609543	1611444	You should be an American Idol, okay?
1612465	1614305	You have an awesome voice.
1615286	1618927	Yeah, and then the one guy was like, You have an awesome voice.
1619568	1620688	You are going to go far.
1620748	1624630	And then the next person was like, You're going to go so far because you have an awesome voice.
1625410	1627891	And then the next person would come up and go, You...
1628740	1629360	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1649867	1650648	You know, type thing.
1651008	1653270	And then there was another girl.
1653550	1654991	This was the one that pissed me off, though.
1655011	1658574	This was weird because I haven't been back to high school in a long time.
1658894	1662217	This was the first time I'd kind of... Shut up.
1662517	1663258	Shut up.
1664119	1665099	I graduated in 96.
1665560	1665940	Fuck you.
1668202	1669663	Seven years ago, bitch.
1671845	1672605	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1672645	1673106	You thought.
1673266	1674707	Well, you need to think more next time.
1674767	1675167	I'm just kidding.
1675187	1675668	I love you.
1676969	1677810	You've been a bad girl.
1677830	1678450	I'm going to punish you.
1681630	1683971	I haven't set foot in a high school in a long time and I remembered why.
1683991	1689373	There was this one girl up there who, I guess she wasn't that popular or something because she did her thing.
1689393	1690833	She was singing Hit We With Her Best Shot.
1691193	1692293	And she was doing a good job.
1692333	1694314	I mean, I would have liked to have seen her get into it a little more.
1694354	1696415	But she, you know, had a lot of courage to get up there on stage.
1696435	1697295	And she was having fun with it.
1697315	1698315	It looked like she had a lot of fun with it.
1698816	1703437	And of course it goes, and the first person goes, it goes, Oh my God, you were really great.
1703457	1705358	You're just like Kelly Clarkson.
1705658	1707778	And you're going to be better than her.
1708079	1709359	And then the next person got up and goes,
1709959	1713522	You have a totally awesome voice and it's going to take you so far in life.
1713862	1717645	And then somebody else in the audience goes, these people in the audience start yelling, liar!
1719126	1728212	And while it was like mildly amusing, I was like, okay, that's fucked up and you shouldn't do that when this girl, this poor girl is getting up on stage, you know, making a fool out of herself for your entertainment.
1729113	1732055	So the mic got over to me and I said, hey, you know what?
1732748	1735350	Girl, you got a lot of balls to get up here on stage and do that.
1735530	1740495	And you're going to go, you know, you're going to be able to accomplish a lot in life, unlike some of these people who will be sitting in the dark forever.
1741435	1745318	And then the guys in the audience are like, rubble, rubble, rubble.
1746079	1750483	And the teacher next to me leaned over and said, thank you for saying that.
1751043	1751884	And that made me feel good.
1752304	1753645	Because I hate assholes.
1753765	1754186	I hate them.
1754486	1756808	And most people in high school were just like the ones I hated.
1757068	1758609	And would call me fag all the time and stuff.
1758870	1760331	And they need to, like, burn in hell.
1760671	1761592	Because they suck.
1762279	1763781	I don't care if they were right, Nelly.
1764201	1764722	It doesn't matter.
1764742	1765683	That's beside the point.
1765943	1766724	You're missing the point.
1768806	1770387	Anyway, that was my week and my day.
1770647	1774291	Loki, how was your week and your day?
1775432	1776433	Not that eventful.
1776914	1784221	I built a computer and upgraded my... Well, I upgraded mine so much that I pretty much built another computer.
1785402	1785743	So...
1786906	1790988	It's odd because this computer runs like Final Fantasy XI really nice.
1791128	1796090	It's like, just with all the settings on high, it still runs good.
1796710	1803453	Yet, it won't run ConquerCam, and yet I'm downloading off the internet and I'm only getting like 1kbps.
1803593	1805353	So it's like, I don't get it.
1806414	1809295	So I don't, whatever, it's fine I guess.
1810075	1814917	But it's, you know, I've got a larger hard drive and I have a computer for my cabinets.
1816896	1818877	I had to go to Fry's a lot this weekend.
1818917	1819618	That sucked.
1819698	1823740	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
1824081	1827823	Went to that thing that Rob was talking about, and that was okay.
1827843	1832486	Yeah, I didn't do much.
1834307	1835588	My week was awesome.
1835748	1837028	It will take me far in life.
1839550	1841231	Yelled at people today.
1841911	1842732	Mostly Andrew.
1843832	1846314	Yeah, that's about it.
1849210	1849891	I didn't do much.
1851472	1853894	Okay, let's hear from some of our guests then, Pixie Dust.
1853934	1855135	I know you've got a lot to say.
1855255	1857477	I didn't have my period on my pants.
1857617	1860079	It was peanut butter sauce, god damn it.
1861240	1862501	But before that, how was your week?
1862521	1863221	What did you do this week?
1863261	1864782	I haven't seen you in like two months.
1864842	1865223	I know.
1865683	1866504	Nothing's gone.
1866524	1867524	You made me sad.
1867905	1868906	No, I didn't.
1869606	1872388	I made you relieved that you didn't have to put up with my period down there.
1872408	1872989	Oh, shut up.
1873349	1874050	Well, how was your week?
1874070	1874430	What did you do?
1875566	1876587	What did I do this week?
1878007	1879308	I fucking don't know.
1879328	1881209	It just went by.
1881469	1883411	Or should I say, who did you do this week?
1883431	1889554	There's this strange guy behind me, and yeah, he's been kissing me all weekend long, so I don't know.
1890595	1892055	I picked him up off the side of the road.
1892096	1892496	Did you?
1892696	1893556	How much did it cost you?
1895698	1896418	You're pretty cheap.
1896458	1897579	You're like five cents, right?
1899019	1903242	No, seriously, school, work has like occupied all my time.
1903922	1907283	So I haven't been doing much of anything except been home on the phone.
1909004	1911745	Have you gotten out to play any Bomani recently or anything?
1911765	1912045	No.
1912325	1914967	Now you, I haven't, we haven't had you on the show in a long time.
1914987	1917488	Did you ever pick up Max 2 for the home?
1919408	1920289	No comment on that.
1921329	1921469	Oh.
1921969	1923170	Kind of, yeah.
1923590	1925331	Oh, I see a little bitterness there.
1925591	1928232	I have a little bitterness towards someone.
1928512	1929552	Oh, okay, I won't say no more.
1929573	1930273	And you guys all know.
1930453	1931173	I won't say no more.
1931253	1932634	I don't know, who is it?
1933746	1934567	It's alright.
1934927	1935888	It's you!
1936828	1937969	You bastard!
1938149	1939010	It's alright.
1939791	1944974	And, basically, I spotted, this fool came up to see me, so, you know.
1946215	1947236	And you went to Rekikon, yes?
1947396	1948317	And I went to Rekikon.
1948677	1949658	And I called in sick to work.
1950526	1951066	Shame on you.
1951106	1953007	You called in sick to work to go to Rekakon?
1953347	1955448	I called in sick to work because Victor came up.
1955788	1956148	Oh, I see.
1956769	1958009	Not to see your asses.
1958289	1959390	Oh, I see how it is.
1959410	1959930	No, we, no.
1960190	1960810	Shut up.
1960930	1961631	Bitch, pass that mic.
1961651	1962311	I'm just kidding.
1962691	1963531	It's mine now.
1963772	1964692	She almost said what I want.
1964892	1965452	You're an ass.
1965572	1966052	You're an ass.
1968033	1969134	But yeah, it's been good.
1969254	1969814	I miss you, Rob.
1970245	1970906	Oh, I missed you too.
1971126	1972047	I missed Loki too.
1972427	1973468	But don't tell Nellie that.
1973669	1975570	The chatroom was reminding me of a good thing.
1975590	1979114	The chatroom was reminding me of a good thing that happened at the con.
1979134	1979775	Something kind of funny.
1980375	1983558	Richie, EvilMalky2DX, one of the folks at Frigasaur chatroom.
1983759	1984619	He caught on fire.
1984720	1985320	No, I'm kidding.
1985360	1985500	What?
1985520	1985881	He did not.
1986141	1986802	No, I'm kidding.
1986862	1987302	God, people.
1987542	1988163	You're gullible.
1988643	1989284	Look up gullible.
1989705	1990065	Oof.
1990709	1993270	He had this sign that said, I like maids.
1993290	1996372	When I first saw him there at the con, we were all outside.
1996692	1999593	And I'm like, Richie, I think I saw a maid cosplayer inside.
1999633	2000914	And it was just like, boom!
2001134	2004696	Have you ever seen one of those Roadrunner cartoons?
2004796	2005576	Oh, it was you.
2005596	2005896	I'm sorry.
2005916	2006977	It was Magus who said it.
2007077	2007557	I thought it.
2007637	2008037	You said it.
2008698	2012600	And have you seen one of those Roadrunner cartoons where it's just like, bing, bing, bing!
2012880	2013860	That was like Richie.
2014200	2016221	It was like, oh, there's a maid cosplayer inside.
2016341	2017122	Bing, bing, bing, bing!
2019036	2019797	No one noticed me.
2019857	2022319	I was surprised.
2022899	2024740	Well, you know us, we know who you are.
2024800	2026622	But a lot of people don't know who you are.
2027162	2029304	They don't know you're the Orange Lounge, madame.
2029424	2030164	Yes, I am.
2030184	2031946	I'm the only one with my foot behind my head.
2032306	2033667	That's the only reason they named me that.
2035488	2036249	No one noticed me.
2036289	2037790	I guess I was kind of plain the other day.
2038130	2039131	Anything exciting today?
2040172	2040632	Hmm.
2041853	2042193	Cake.
2042794	2043394	And fried Twinkies.
2046637	2048398	Alright, no styling.
2049584	2050745	Let's hear from no silence.
2050985	2054326	I know he doesn't talk much in person compared to online, but we'll try to get something out of him.
2054386	2057027	No, I'm two different people, you know.
2057067	2057207	What?
2057267	2057628	Yeah, you're on.
2057668	2060969	Okay, I'm two different people from like online and, you know, real life.
2061089	2061569	It's okay.
2061669	2063510	I'm just making this observation.
2063870	2070193	I would be a little scared if you were kind of bouncing off your walls and changing your nickname every five seconds like you do on IRC, but that's okay.
2070933	2072414	Multi-personalities, yeah.
2072474	2072914	It's all good.
2073522	2074843	Oh, just talk about Angel, all of you?
2102073	2112037	Okay, I realize this is episode 69 and all, but let's not make me barf, okay, from all this lovey-dovey chat, because I'm the only single person in this room right now who's not dating someone else in the room.
2113298	2115999	So I feel really like a seventh wheel right now.
2116079	2116659	Okay, I'll tell you this.
2118139	2127223	Coming back from Hollywood Video, first time coming to Sacramento and everything, and whoever designs these layouts for these stores and malls, you know,
2128908	2132071	This huge rock, I ran over this rock and I was clinging like in mid-air.
2132211	2132931	It was hilarious.
2133812	2134973	We were like hovering.
2135333	2136234	Oh my god, a rock.
2137655	2142078	I was like, I was on the passenger side and I was like, what the fuck did you hit?
2142098	2143860	I thought it was a fire hydrant.
2143880	2145601	I was like, well that was an interesting part.
2145701	2146962	But it was like, oh shit.
2150545	2151766	So, that was interesting.
2151806	2152566	Well, I'm taking your time.
2152827	2153247	That's cool.
2153787	2154828	And that's pretty much my day.
2155589	2155869	Or week.
2156289	2157010	Alright, alright.
2159484	2161085	Angel, how was your week?
2161125	2161765	Hi, Rob.
2161825	2162645	Hi, how are you?
2162905	2163265	Good.
2163645	2166266	Didn't your local Scandia get a new Bomani game recently?
2168407	2169027	Percussion Freaks.
2169667	2170247	Percussion Freaks.
2170267	2171627	Now, not Drum Freaks, but Percussion Freaks.
2171647	2173428	Well, it's Drum Mania, but I mean, it's Drum Mania.
2173468	2177189	I know, but it's a different name, so that makes it worth talking about.
2177309	2182710	Well, I suppose it's a different name, except for the fact that it still says Drum Mania on the stupid machine.
2182770	2183750	Have you gotten a chance to play it at all?
2184010	2184491	No.
2184511	2185551	Oh, well then fuck it.
2185591	2186131	Tell us about your week.
2188762	2190343	Um, let's see.
2191704	2198188	I pretty much worked all week except for like school on Thursday, which I was sick for, so I didn't go, but that's okay.
2198769	2202351	Um, then I just pretty much waited out the rest of the week until I got here.
2203792	2204233	So yay.
2207115	2207435	Anyway.
2208636	2209756	I'm going to be boring now.
2211438	2215000	Boring and monotoned and meh.
2217165	2218266	Pie!
2220368	2221909	Mmm, pie.
2223650	2226973	Andrew, the 69th Magus, how was your week, how was your day?
2228254	2232657	Uh, week, long and hard, like, never mind.
2232957	2235800	Um, over.
2237861	2238121	Over.
2238622	2242565	But, uh, kind of went through the motions of
2243211	2260821	Just going to school, just, yes, I'm making all these terrible puns, and just went to school, went home, went to school, went home, went to school, went home, went to school, went home, all week, and finally, Saturday rolled around, went to Rekticon, and wee, fun.
2262322	2267585	So, rest of the week was boring, weekend is just all hyper and happy and shit.
2268740	2274645	If I hear the 5678 song one more time, I swear to... Oh, shit.
2277908	2279110	No, not twisted earth.
2283854	2286336	You should see... Nellie, you should see what else I can whistle.
2288018	2288818	You blow well.
2290500	2292202	I can blow these lips very well, Nellie.
2297130	2303335	He's quite talented at the meat flute.
2303495	2307599	Alright, we're going to take a break and when we come back we'll talk about some more Barmani.
2308159	2311182	And I think we will have ourselves a cage match.
2312023	2315666	But the rules for the cage match tonight are a little bit different.
2315906	2318608	I'll be in the cage actually dancing topless.
2319068	2322932	So stay tuned for that because we're going to have ourselves a cage match when we come back.
2323592	2325514	And we'll talk about a whole bunch of other stuff too.
2326532	2329453	This break we're going to do a segment of a bunch of Mr. T songs.
2329733	2331334	Because Mr. T rocks.
2331634	2333675	And I'm not talking about I pity the fool.
2333695	2335936	I pity the fool who takes my gold chain.
2335996	2338897	I'm talking about that other Mr. T. The one that we all know from Bomani.
2338917	2339317	We'll be back.
2442708	2445141	Thanks for watching!
2639795	2644579	From the Setsquad to Orange Labs, this PDR sucks!
2644939	2645259	Holla!
2645419	2645740	Suck!
2645760	2646000	Suck!
2646020	2646400	Suck!
2646620	2646801	Suck!
2646821	2647021	Suck!
2647041	2647181	Suck!
2647201	2647421	Suck!
2659833	2665177	I mean, alright, we're back and you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 69.
2666398	2671502	And as promised, we're going to get into a cage match here very shortly, but I thought this was worth talking about this week.
2671962	2674344	Loki, I know you've been somewhat involved in this.
2675325	2677666	There's been this movement going on lately.
2677886	2685192	MTV is holding this contest and they are naming the best game of the millennium.
2686633	2691417	Now, of course, we're only three years into the millennium, but they're going to name the best game of the whole damn millennium anyway.
2692357	2693298	Up for nomination?
2693838	2694559	DDR.
2694659	2696701	This is MTV and Electronic Gaming Monthly.
2697361	2697741	Milkshake.
2698062	2699242	Also up for nomination?
2700043	2700643	Halo.
2701364	2704827	The Final Fantasy series, the Super Mario series, yada, yada, yada.
2704907	2710631	Loki, tell us more about what's been going on, trying to flood the channels with votes for DDR.
2711636	2712537	It's really stupid.
2713237	2720903	MTV is really genius, and they allowed people to vote more than once for their game.
2721603	2728028	So obviously that opens it up for, hey, let's make a script, and I'm going to go ahead and vote for my game millions of times.
2728488	2732651	And so that's what everyone did, at least the people that are voting for Halo and DDR.
2733372	2740097	So this went on for like two days, and then finally MTV closed their polls, and they were like, okay, find out the results on January 2nd.
2741636	2744318	Okay, so that... And we thought, okay, they're done.
2744478	2747980	So pretty much, you know, Halo and DDR are going to win, you know, according to that.
2748040	2749241	And DDR was in the lead.
2749961	2752763	Then for some reason, people thought you could still vote after the polls closed.
2752803	2754784	So they kept doing it, and doing it, and doing it.
2754824	2767171	And finally, they opened the polls again, supposedly changing their script, or their, like, webpage or whatever, their submission thing, so that you can't, you know, do this multiple voting thing, yet it's still getting through.
2767672	2767772	So...
2768237	2768697	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2791233	2792154	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2815668	2822154	It wasn't like a program, but it was a web page that would refresh like 10 frames over and over again with the voting page.
2822595	2826398	And we had this artist up to 98% of the vote for the Viewer's Choice Award.
2826759	2835407	And the day of the MTV Awards, they posted a message on there that said, Well, this person won the web vote, but we're only going to count the phone votes for the real award.
2835427	2836808	So stay tuned tonight and see who wins.
2837069	2838190	And a completely different person won.
2838710	2840051	So MTV, you know what?
2840131	2842113	If they want to just throw out the web votes, they'll do it.
2842193	2847537	And what they're going to do is they're going to keep all the advertising dollars for all those banners that loaded.
2847557	2848177	Because think of it.
2848918	2851940	Every time you refresh that page, that's like three more banners.
2852180	2854142	Because MTV.com is full of logos.
2854522	2855663	Three more banners that load.
2855723	2861528	So you vote a million times, you're giving MTV $1,000 from all that refreshing.
2862108	2863689	So kind of something to think about.
2863769	2864910	At least that's the way I look at it.
2866331	2867072	You have something to say, Pixies?
2867092	2867172	Yes.
2868183	2870604	Well, you want to know something more pathetic than that?
2871444	2877966	The search for Miss Applebottom on VH1, where they're searching for the woman with the perfect butt.
2878866	2883268	And the choice host of that is Nelly.
2884688	2885108	This Nelly?
2885128	2886028	Not this Nelly.
2887009	2888209	Nelly with the band-aid.
2888249	2888629	Oh, boy.
2888849	2890590	It's getting hot in here.
2890710	2891490	It's so pathetic.
2891530	2894831	There was nothing but big booty black girls and adult models there.
2896548	2898210	I can make it clap!
2898270	2900752	Look, I do not want to hear about your twat clapping, okay?
2900872	2902813	I would have thought J-Lo would have been a judge on that show.
2904175	2905556	She has the queen of all butts.
2906677	2908038	I have the king, she has the queen.
2909259	2910800	I literally have a king-sized butt.
2912441	2913983	Are you the flying duchess?
2914403	2915784	Yes, because it's so wide.
2916164	2918987	I'm like, I like Sarah Ferguson, I have like a wide ass.
2920208	2920628	Yeah.
2920768	2922690	I like how you throw that, unlike Sarah Ferguson.
2924577	2928734	Well, you know what's weird is that they're going to be doing that Partridge Family redo pretty soon, too.
2929075	2929276	I mean...
2930368	2932009	Oh, Mavis, aren't you in that?
2933749	2937311	VH1 is a network I'll watch occasionally because they actually play some good videos.
2937391	2939832	I mean, this is how I know I'm getting old.
2940132	2941852	Because I prefer VH1 to MTV.
2941872	2945054	The music on MTV I don't like as much as I like the music on VH1.
2945094	2946374	It's like, oh God, am I getting old?
2946694	2955778	Because I prefer the station that plays things like, you know, that kind of skew a little bit older, like Sting and Coldplay and Sarah McLachlan.
2955818	2957458	And bands that don't play on MTV a lot.
2957498	2958679	I'm like, am I getting old?
2959665	2962186	So this is kind of one reason I don't care about the MTV polls.
2962326	2963887	I don't watch MTV, so I care less who wins.
2964267	2972271	But word has come from some of the folks from Team Seattle that MTV was actually out there in Seattle filming some stuff just in case.
2972732	2977574	So if DDR does win, you can expect to see some massive bar raping on MTV.
2977694	2978134	No, I'm just kidding.
2978154	2978815	I'm kidding.
2978835	2980135	Much love for Seattle.
2984505	2986607	So it's just, either way, it's going to happen.
2986687	2987708	It's just going to be sad.
2988189	2991552	And you know, I'm almost willing to bet Microsoft's going to win.
2991712	2992313	Or you know what?
2992473	2996137	I'm going to be willing to bet that Grand Theft Auto Vice City wins, no matter what.
2996826	3000289	That's the thing, because it's trendy to like a Grand Theft Auto by Cindy.
3000309	3010416	It would be like avant-garde for MTV to give the award, because we're going to give the award to a controversial game where you shoot hookers, where you fuck the women and then blow their heads off.
3011316	3012817	That's going to be the best game of the millennium.
3012857	3014779	That sums up 2003 right there.
3015099	3015800	Grand Theft Auto 3.
3015860	3020583	It's just going to be so retarded.
3023605	3024586	I just don't like MTV.
3027045	3027645	Thanks for watching!
3043919	3049921	Okay, the exposure of DDR to anybody on MTV was that stupid fucking Wade Robson commercial.
3050302	3051562	That's all they fucking know.
3051942	3057224	All they know is Afro Man and fucking all his stupid shit like, Oh, you have to go up and do it and do the side.
3057664	3057825	Oh!
3058605	3061126	I'm like, I don't want DDR on MTV.
3061246	3062726	I don't want those people playing my game.
3063587	3064867	Stay off my dance pad.
3065428	3065848	Get off.
3066848	3067949	Like those little girls that come in.
3067969	3070470	Alright, the new thing is going to be Karaoke Revolution.
3071130	3071410	Here's...
3072338	3073539	Goodie fucking goodie.
3074179	3075339	No style in that something he wants to say?
3078781	3079801	Um, no.
3080902	3082062	Oh, well don't tease me like that.
3083243	3083383	Um.
3084703	3086384	Oh, but Rob, you love to be teased.
3086404	3087645	I do love to be teased.
3088245	3088405	Oh.
3088805	3093207	We'll talk a little more about Karaoke Revolution and things like that after this cage match we're going to have.
3093587	3096969	Now, as I promised, tonight is a little different of a cage match.
3097409	3099470	And because it's a different cage match, we have different music.
3101351	3102512	I just like to hear y'all mocha.
3104254	3108238	So, tonight we are having what's called a reverse cage match.
3108918	3120409	The reason why we're having a reverse cage match tonight is because Jamie left for Alabama and assumed that her song would win for two more weeks and forgot to give me... No, I think she just forgot because she was really busy packing everything.
3120769	3122551	She forgot to give me two more songs for cage match.
3123138	3125280	or if she told me, I've forgotten, it's my bad.
3125620	3139070	So what we've decided we'd do tonight is we'd table the cage match, because we all know Loki's song probably would have won again anyway, because he won last week with Battle Without Honor or Humanity, the 88-7 Lens Mix, which we'll play later in the show for those who... Oh shit, no I don't.
3140251	3143213	I guess we won't be playing it later in the show, because I don't have the mp3 of it.
3143293	3143574	Rob?
3143734	3143954	Yes?
3143974	3145095	Oh my god, it's a cheeseburger!
3147435	3150718	Anyway, I guess I can't play because I don't have the MP3 of it.
3150738	3156484	Unless somebody in the chatroom I sent it to can send it back to me because it was on Loki's old computer, which is not operative right now.
3157225	3161629	Anyway, tonight in the reverse cage match, this is what's going to happen.
3162401	3169145	Loki and I, between, we're each going to put in two songs that we believe are some of the worst things we've ever heard.
3169545	3173747	And they're going to be Bomani or Dance Mania related in some way.
3174127	3177309	And you guys will vote for the absolute worst song that you heard.
3178189	3182732	And the loser will be banned from Orange Lounge Radio indefinitely.
3182772	3185733	You will never hear this song on the station ever again.
3186033	3186334	Ever.
3187014	3188174	We will ban the song.
3188275	3188875	It's gone.
3190131	3196799	All right, so Loki and I are going to pick two songs each, so you're going to vote for the song you hate the most, the song you want to leave tonight.
3197800	3199942	All right, so that's the reverse cage match.
3199962	3204587	Instead of picking a song to win and be in rotation all week long, you're going to pick for a song to lose and be banned indefinitely.
3205768	3211475	All right, so first up is going to be my first pick, and it's actually a song from Dancing Stage Fever.
3212395	3213036	How exciting!
3213076	3215678	This is a song that you can actually dance to in Dancing Stage Fever.
3215738	3220924	So even if it gets banned from the station indefinitely, you'll still be able to play it if you really, really want to.
3222105	3225308	Here's my pick for tonight's reverse cage match to ban from the station.
3225648	3227450	It's the Spice Girls with Wannabe.
3227710	3228031	Enjoy!
3243625	3264851	If you want my future, forget my past If you wanna get with me, better make it fast Now don't go wasting my precious time Get your act together, we could be just fine I'll tell you what I want, what I really, really want Don't tell me what you want, what you really, really want
3267200	3289295	If you wanna be my lover You gotta get with my friends Make it last forever Friendship never ends If you wanna be my lover You have got to give Thinking is too easy But that's the way it is If you wanna be my lover You gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta Make it last forever Somebody's got a mind It's all about Somebody's got a mind
3300613	3323499	All right, that was song number one in tonight's reverse cage match for worst song ever to be banned from the station.
3323599	3328400	Spice Girls was one of the... Let's go around and see what people thought of that and rate it on a scale of one to ten.
3328820	3329280	Pixie Dust.
3330282	3336707	All I gotta say is, I have Scary Spice hair, so I love that song.
3337347	3337788	Dammit.
3338228	3340330	Reminds me of my youth, you fuckface.
3341631	3342231	Dammit!
3343572	3344613	Fuck you.
3344793	3345894	I want that song.
3346054	3347255	My favorite song's still one.
3348135	3350097	Well, if you give it a one, that means you think it's bad.
3350337	3351098	Oh, I'll give it a ten!
3351678	3351958	Alright.
3351978	3353279	I thought we were doing it in reverse.
3353900	3354020	Okay.
3354040	3354160	Okay.
3355146	3356267	I thought you were doing it in reverse.
3356347	3359108	No, you still vote on 1 to 10, 10 being good, 1 being bad.
3359128	3359808	So you give it a 10?
3360388	3363530	It's not as good as some Spice Girls songs, but, you know, well.
3363550	3363910	All right.
3365031	3365371	Angel.
3367512	3368072	Yes, Rob?
3368432	3368672	Yes.
3370293	3375535	Um, well, yeah, I guess old school or something.
3375555	3378737	Not really old school, but something from my childhood or whatever.
3379117	3379917	Teenage years.
3380698	3382739	Um, it's okay.
3382859	3383259	They're just...
3383931	3384712	There, okay?
3384952	3386053	Specials are just there.
3386413	3386733	Whatever.
3386793	3387073	Alright.
3388574	3389435	Hell, six.
3389955	3390395	Okay.
3390436	3392177	Yeah, I didn't like them anyway.
3392457	3393217	No styling.
3393518	3396099	No styling.
3397300	3401723	I really liked the Spice Girls when I was young and everything, but... Yeah, yeah, I know.
3401863	3403625	It's a high school film, but I give it a four.
3405045	3405706	Alright.
3405746	3406126	Magus.
3406146	3406506	Magus.
3412287	3413007	I think J.K.
3413027	3421272	in the chatroom said it best when he said that he'd like to bang about three out of five of them, but he'd rather they keep the dick in their mouth so he doesn't have to hear them.
3422173	3423194	Zero!
3423694	3424474	Bye-bye!
3425135	3425515	All right.
3427536	3427696	No.
3429037	3430578	It's a zing for him, not for me.
3430658	3433380	My vote is be glad it wasn't Spice Up Your Life, okay?
3434179	3435079	I know that whole song.
3435099	3436100	So I give it a two.
3436500	3438360	I know that whole song, and I love that whole song.
3438460	3444182	Up next, Loki, your first pick, because we're each putting in two songs tonight because Jamie's not here, so we're going to have four songs to pick from.
3444382	3448984	Loki, what's your first song tonight that you're going to nominate to be banned from Orange Lounge forever?
3449929	3451549	This song is like the worst song ever.
3451569	3453330	You guys seem to like it, so you know what?
3453490	3454290	I hope it's gone.
3454990	3455270	Leave.
3455790	3456290	It's done.
3456670	3457770	This is lame.
3458451	3460091	I give you fucking Holic.
3460411	3461951	Vote for Holic, you bitch.
3461971	3463212	You fucking bitch and whiny.
3463232	3464212	You can't vote for Holic.
3464572	3466552	Vote for it now.
3467192	3475014	All right, so Loki is putting in Holic to be banned from the station forever because he's sick of people trying to vote for it in the cage match.
3475414	3476094	So here we go.
3477024	3478393	Song number two to be banned tonight.
3478413	3479561	This is Tack with Holic.
3564622	3568223	Alright, that was song number two to be voted for eviction from Orange Lounge Radio tonight.
3568243	3578526	That was Tack with Holic, and Loki's trying to be cute because everybody always votes for Holic in our cage matches, so he just wants that song off the station so people don't try to vote for that shit anymore.
3578926	3580386	But you guys, here's your say.
3580406	3581786	What do you think of Tack with Holic?
3582887	3584687	It's Tack, it's Holic, it's holorific.
3585367	3585847	One to ten.
3588965	3590206	Just for Jamie, I'd give it a 10.
3590426	3591046	Alright, Angel.
3591586	3592987	It's tackified, it has to stay 10.
3593247	3594748	Alright, no styling.
3594768	3600291	Oh, I'd give it a nice 10.
3600611	3600951	Alright.
3601691	3602051	Magus.
3602372	3603752	It's tack, need I say more?
3603772	3603752	10.
3604093	3605113	Alright.
3607154	3608935	Run, because it sucks.
3609395	3611396	It's the same damn song over and over again.
3611416	3612957	He thought he was all cool by, you know...
3613632	3616034	I'm doing it in 7, 4, you know, measures, whatever.
3616054	3616915	Sucks.
3617455	3617715	Lame.
3618036	3618536	Lame song.
3618656	3620217	Sounds like every single other song is done.
3623240	3623580	Alright.
3624180	3625762	I'll give you the one already.
3626082	3626462	I give it a 9.
3627723	3629405	Because I'm just not going to give it a 10.
3629465	3630946	Because I'm just that big of a prick.
3631726	3632387	Alright.
3633067	3636390	Song number 3 tonight is my pick, and it's a Dance Mania pick.
3636790	3639252	This comes from Dance Mania EX1.
3639973	3641034	And it's a cover song.
3642203	3645747	And it's a cover of a song that was really famous because it was in a movie once.
3646928	3649551	And the name of the group that covers it is called Bushida.
3650412	3653295	And this is their cover of My Heart Will Go On.
3653535	3654796	My pick for tonight.
3655257	3655777	One!
3655878	3656478	One!
3656578	3656738	One!
3656959	3657099	One!
3657339	3658640	My Heart Will Go On.
3659241	3659702	Enjoy.
3680227	3680888	Thanks for watching!
3784156	3788158	Alright, I decided to save you by only playing half of that, because it goes on for four minutes.
3788178	3792721	That was My Heart Will Go On, by... I don't even remember the name of it.
3792761	3796463	Originally by Celine Dion, but on Dance Mania EX1, that was by Bushida.
3796483	3800065	I'm sorry, not EX1, Dance Mania X1, that's by Bushida.
3800105	3801486	Your guys' thoughts, Pixie Dust.
3802447	3806289	It's covered of Celine Dion.
3806709	3809551	It made me fucking die!
3810251	3811072	Bastard!
3812575	3815998	I hate playing Neon, so... I'll give this a zero on my list.
3816498	3818039	Alright, Angel.
3819140	3819700	Um, no.
3819820	3820241	Die.
3820501	3820641	One.
3821462	3822222	Uh, no Skyland.
3824884	3826545	I give it a zero.
3826585	3827226	You know, 0.1.
3827286	3828547	I don't like this song at all.
3829708	3830628	Alright, Magus.
3831289	3831769	Zero.
3831829	3832710	Goodbye!
3832730	3834331	Uh, Loki.
3835131	3838413	It gets a ten because that movie was so sad.
3838954	3840014	Oh my god.
3840294	3846178	He's so gone and she's so sad because her love died and became a popsicle.
3854343	3862789	I am the world's greatest singer and I give my song a ten because I have six crannies and you have none.
3866282	3868183	Next thing you know, it's Lane Dion Hot Pockets.
3868483	3868824	All right.
3869384	3872287	Loki, the final pick in tonight's reverse cage match.
3872327	3874629	For song to be banned from Orange Lounge forever, what's your pick?
3874649	3881695	You know, they saved my other song from being put in here, because it probably would have gotten voted off, and now you'd be subjected to it even more.
3882496	3885499	Well, the song I was going to pick was Eddie Murphy, Party All the Time, but...
3886560	3887481	We like that song.
3887521	3897031	So instead, we've got Nancy and the Boys, a wonderful speed group who sucks because it's speed music, doing Complicated.
3897391	3898192	So eat this.
3899694	3903397	Alright, from Speed 10, this is Nancy and the Boys with Complicated.
3903417	3903537	Enjoy.
3903557	3903878	Enjoy.
3958124	3959685	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4038394	4041517	Oh my god, I'm so glad we did this tonight.
4042077	4045640	The chatroom reactions to these songs are fucking priceless.
4045700	4046381	This is great.
4046401	4047441	We've got to do this again.
4048682	4051825	Such classic lines as, she sounds like a meth addict.
4053889	4055671	I heard that when I was over at Garrett's house when he first got C-10.
4055691	4059254	We just rolled on the floor laughing from that crap.
4059274	4061877	It's unfortunately better than Avril, but, you know.
4080365	4087529	Who the fuck either turned up or changed the speed on the record player to where it's like, or just, who scratched it by Avril Lavigne CD?
4087569	4088129	I mean, mine?
4088149	4088890	Maybe it was Pixie's.
4106184	4106845	Fuck you.
4107165	4108446	I don't have Avril.
4108846	4110668	I have fucking Nancy in the voice.
4110708	4111709	Get it right, bitch.
4113830	4114231	No.
4114331	4115892	On a scale of one to ten.
4116452	4116653	Angel.
4117193	4117553	Oh, yeah.
4117633	4117894	Right.
4118794	4120275	One being low and ten being high.
4121276	4122057	One, bitch.
4122557	4123118	No styling.
4123158	4124339	Your thoughts on Nancy in the voice.
4124359	4127361	My thoughts and thoughts is too fast and it sounds like, you know, Disney World or whatever.
4127461	4128102	I give it a one.
4128442	4128722	All right.
4128882	4129963	One.
4130023	4130384	Magus.
4132365	4132966	Guy.
4133706	4134347	Zero.
4135228	4135428	Loki.
4135448	4135548	Zero.
4137272	4138033	I give it a 2.
4138193	4143215	The song almost killed Andrew over there, so it's got some power to it.
4146176	4148537	I give this song a 10, and I'm telling you why.
4149257	4154779	I almost peed my pants laughing at the chatroom reactions during that song, and that is worth something.
4155600	4155920	Alright.
4156060	4158941	Let's see, Rob, you almost peed your pants in Vegas or almost died?
4159947	4161708	and I almost peed my pants on a dead magus.
4161748	4162088	So what?
4162108	4162409	Alright.
4164290	4165331	That could be a fetish film.
4166191	4167412	Alright, here are your choices.
4167452	4169713	Remember, tonight is a reverse cage match.
4169753	4175477	The song that wins, quote unquote, if we can call it that, will be banned from Orange Lounge for all eternity.
4176278	4176818	Here we go.
4177718	4178339	Here's a recap.
4178359	4180260	You vote for the song you want to ban.
4180580	4181201	Alright, here we go.
4181321	4183142	Spice Girls with Wannabe, choice number one.
4184249	4198008	If you wanna be my lover, you gotta get with my friends Making love forever, friendship never ends Alright, song number two you can vote for tonight is kind of surprising, but it's Tack with Holic
4211371	4215752	Alright, song number two you can vote for tonight is from Dance Mia X1.
4215792	4219294	It's a cover of Celine Dion with My Heart Will Go On.
4226076	4239720	Alright, and song number four you can vote for tonight from Speed 10, Nancy and the Boys with Complicated.
4248547	4249467	Alright, there you go.
4249788	4251388	Place vote now.
4251448	4254809	Those votes come a private message to me, Sky, in the chat room.
4255490	4255810	Alright.
4257130	4257971	Oh, wow.
4259091	4260151	I'm loving the reactions.
4260171	4262012	They're like, no, don't do the recaps.
4262072	4263833	Don't play them again, please, for the love of God.
4263873	4265513	Alright, we'll tie those votes momentarily.
4265994	4269235	Nellie, you had an interesting opinion on Nancy the Boy's Complicated.
4270075	4270655	I loved it.
4271236	4272296	It's beautiful.
4272316	4274077	Why did you love it and think it's beautiful?
4274917	4275677	It's funny.
4276297	4277738	It sounds like the chipmunks.
4278590	4280851	Yeah, why do people buy Chipmunks albums?
4280891	4281792	This is what I want to know.
4282032	4286154	The Chipmunks, maybe were funny in the 50s, but they're not funny now.
4286614	4287734	Because they're only two bucks.
4288175	4288955	Alright.
4290075	4291996	It's cheap entertainment, like you, Rob.
4292517	4296859	Because all you've got to do is slow down the song, and it's the real song.
4297139	4297919	The real song.
4299620	4300100	Yeah.
4301121	4301481	Alright.
4302601	4305182	Nancy and the boys should die of chlamydia, from what I understand.
4305763	4306003	And they...
4307308	4309750	You can't, a song can't die of chlamydia.
4310190	4311691	AIDS maybe, but not chlamydia.
4311711	4314452	You know what, we should send them to Elephant Bar and they can die of hepatitis.
4315053	4315233	Alright.
4315773	4318415	Hey, if there's a tie tonight, you guys, we'll kick both songs off.
4318455	4319095	How's that sound?
4319996	4320736	Yay!
4321217	4322277	There probably will be.
4322297	4323178	I'm thinking there's going to be.
4323858	4326480	If there's a tie tonight, guess what other song gets voted off?
4326500	4328221	Yeah, that's right, Holic.
4328741	4329782	Holic in the song.
4330622	4333344	I think I see some votes coming in for Holic, so you never know.
4333704	4334945	My Holic could win, we'll see.
4335640	4339442	and that Jamie is going to be a pissed off woman if she hears the Holic got banned from the station.
4339842	4341163	She's going to have my head.
4341663	4346226	She will never... Not like that, you sick fucks.
4348987	4352709	She can possibly quit the show if Holic gets banned.
4352990	4354190	I know Holic's not going to get banned.
4354210	4355391	Come on, look at the other crap we played.
4355731	4356411	We'll see what happens, though.
4356431	4357072	We'll see what happens.
4358272	4358593	Alright.
4359933	4360073	So...
4361474	4363134	Let's go into some other Bomani news.
4363355	4366035	Maybe the chat room will calm down a bit if we talk about some other things.
4366775	4367636	Everybody breathe in.
4368536	4368996	Breathe out.
4370056	4370656	Alright, alright.
4372597	4374077	I'm also in Bomani news this week.
4374097	4375978	Don't touch there, Rob!
4376078	4382559	Time Magazine, DDR Freak is reporting, that Time Magazine has named as Game of the Year for 2003, Karaoke Revolution.
4387026	4387306	Why?
4387606	4387947	Why?
4388187	4388707	Dead silence.
4388767	4389308	What do you guys think?
4389328	4389948	What do you guys think of this?
4390068	4392910	I'd like to hear Loki's thoughts on Karaoke Revolution, having played this.
4394791	4397173	Um, it just came out.
4397413	4399434	How can they, like, say, oh, it's awesome!
4400215	4401136	Like, awesome!
4401296	4401736	Oh, wow!
4403157	4405098	Like, totally freaked me out, I forgot it on!
4405138	4408661	How did they, like, you know, how'd they come up with that?
4408761	4410262	I mean, that's just really stupid.
4412063	4414945	This game rocks, because you can sing the songs!
4418536	4424621	Do you think it's possibly because it's innovative and people like these innovative games and they think it's going to start a revolution?
4425461	4426302	Isn't that innovative?
4426602	4429444	Oh yeah, karaoke was just invented by Konami!
4429764	4430985	Woo!
4433207	4434168	But what about the eye toy?
4434188	4437470	I think the eye toy is way more innovative than karaoke revolution.
4440752	4443895	Yeah, but you can't sing with poorly recorded cover artists.
4445273	4448214	Hey, one of those poorly recorded cover artists is one of Angel's friends.
4449235	4449735	Any point.
4451376	4453137	Asshole!
4454097	4454557	God!
4456438	4456758	All right.
4457239	4457939	Not like me.
4461161	4462801	So, Time Magazine named Karaoke Revolution.
4463482	4466163	Max 2 never got named Game of the Anything.
4467363	4469525	Ultramix won't get named Game of the Anything.
4469945	4472266	DDR is just getting shit on left and right.
4472346	4473987	It may win MTV's poll.
4474107	4474567	Oh, goody.
4476163	4477524	What about Enter the Matrix?
4477564	4478825	That was an awesome game.
4479285	4480886	Oh boy, you forgot about that one.
4481386	4482787	Guess it was better than the movies, right?
4483047	4483548	I'm just kidding.
4484308	4486249	It was better than Karaoke Revolution.
4488210	4490112	Karaoke Revolution is kind of retarded.
4490492	4494054	All it is is you're basically just taking your home console and singing with it.
4494894	4495335	Poorly.
4495655	4496816	Singing poorly with it.
4498276	4499157	That is just me.
4499837	4500778	And a lot of other people.
4501756	4503236	All you're doing is encouraging them.
4503316	4503916	God damn it.
4504216	4507297	If there's anything in this world we need is encouraging stupid people.
4507657	4509057	Why do we need to encourage them?
4509817	4510277	God damn it.
4510317	4513978	You won't let the stupid Chinese lady just stop asking me for samples.
4514218	4515838	No, you have to go and interject.
4516338	4519559	You have to go, Oh, yes, I will take a sample.
4520239	4521639	We people want samples.
4521919	4523020	I want to ask them now.
4523620	4525540	And so, you just won't stop.
4525860	4527120	Same with this goddamn thing.
4527180	4529881	People sometimes weren't meant to sing.
4530201	4530961	Just a fact.
4532357	4532957	Don't sing.
4533017	4536820	And this gives them a false hope that someday they'll become a singing superstar.
4536980	4540683	And in the meantime, they have to torture us with their horrible renditions of crap.
4541944	4543325	Including complicated.
4544405	4544926	Lame.
4545706	4545906	No.
4546827	4547808	Game of the year?
4547988	4548728	I think not.
4551410	4553712	But you seemed to have a good time when you played this game.
4556034	4558235	Oh yeah, great time was had by me.
4558255	4558315	Not...
4567022	4567662	Okay.
4568603	4569404	Alright, Pixie Dust.
4570225	4575371	This game encourages my Filipino relatives to go and buy an Xbox and play Karaoke Revolution.
4575511	4576472	Actually, it's on the PS2, dear.
4576512	4577053	Oh, PS2.
4577113	4578014	I thought it was on Xbox.
4578234	4579495	No, Xbox is Ultramix.
4579695	4580096	Oh, okay.
4580991	4584253	I bet you anything Xbox will get a karaoke revolution if it sells well on PS2.
4584273	4585054	I bet you anything.
4585514	4589097	It encourages my aunts to go, oh, that's karaoke.
4589357	4589897	Oh, shit.
4590078	4595541	Okay, we'll go get that and we'll get some wine and beer and smoke a lot and fight cocks all day long.
4597203	4597443	Yeah.
4598744	4599464	Filipino relatives.
4601986	4603267	Fight cocks.
4603527	4604268	Fight them.
4604328	4605108	Oh, fight cocks.
4605128	4605889	Cock fighting.
4605969	4610352	Yeah, why don't we just come out with like Blowjob Revolution or something like that, you know?
4611693	4615594	Didn't we have a list list like that one week where we were deciding what needs a Bomani game?
4615614	4616575	And I want to say something.
4616855	4619536	Yeah, I want to say Beat Your Meat Mania won that, actually.
4619596	4620196	I think it did.
4622597	4622877	Anyway.
4624138	4627579	Who knows what revolution Konami will try to start next.
4627599	4629800	Okay, we're going to take another break here.
4630160	4632021	And when we come back, we'll announce the winner of the cage match.
4632061	4633421	I have to take a break to tally the votes.
4633461	4636722	We have more votes tonight in tonight's cage match than I've ever seen in a cage match ever.
4637043	4640724	Which makes me think we need to do a reverse cage match every week.
4642222	4643122	Just kidding, just kidding.
4643322	4643743	Don't kill me.
4644123	4644543	Don't kill me.
4644623	4646324	Yeah, we'll end up having no songs on the station.
4647724	4648905	I'll just keep voting for Holic.
4651446	4655147	Also, are we going to get into this add-on crap later?
4656047	4656548	Absolutely.
4656588	4660389	When we come back, we're going to talk a little more about Ultramix since it is coming out this week after all.
4661049	4663030	In this break, just a random potpourri of stuff.
4663050	4666911	A couple songs from Guitar Freaks and something from DDR that I rather like.
4666951	4668312	And I know some of you listening like it too.
4668812	4670593	So enjoy these good songs.
4672068	4673790	After that little orgy of bad stuff.
4673810	4674471	And we'll be right back.
4674491	4675492	Of course, it's all relative.
4675512	4676694	You can hate all three of these songs.
4676774	4678476	But, well, sucks to be you.
4679077	4679498	We'll be back.
4755027	4756029	It's great man!
4782219	4783159	Thank you for watching!
4825782	4827082	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network
4854926	4855743	Thanks for watching!
4944540	4945781	Orange Lounge Radio.
4946101	4948262	We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
4955426	4956307	Alright, we're back.
4957307	4958648	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
4958908	4963091	And I have the winner, or should I say loser, of tonight's reverse cage match.
4963151	4963731	You are loser!
4964051	4969314	Just out of curiosity, what would you have voted for, gang, and what do you think is going to lose?
4969394	4970995	I'll tell you, tonight's loser...
4972651	4974372	Got 79% of the votes.
4975993	4976574	What do you think?
4976754	4977675	What do you think should lose?
4977695	4978515	What do you think will lose?
4978575	4979056	No silent.
4980056	4981557	Uh, the second song.
4982038	4982458	Holic?
4983419	4984680	You think Holic should lose?
4984700	4986841	You think Holic should lose or will lose?
4986861	4987662	Yeah, will lose.
4987862	4988782	You think Holic will lose?
4989163	4989423	Okay.
4989743	4991324	And, uh, the one will stay?
4991344	4992785	Well, that's it.
4992805	4994827	What would you want to kick out of the four of those?
4994847	4994907	Um...
4997099	4998640	The slow one, the Titanic song.
4998660	4999901	Okay, my heart will go on.
4999921	5000642	Yeah, that one.
5000922	5003624	Pixie Dust, what do you think will be booted and what would you do?
5003644	5007707	You have just got on Jamie's bad side for saying how it will be banned.
5008127	5010389	You fucker.
5011510	5013431	Avril, or Nancy and the Boys.
5013831	5014392	Will be banned?
5014952	5015573	Will be banned.
5015773	5016633	And what should be banned?
5017274	5018014	What should be banned?
5018054	5018315	Yeah.
5018515	5019756	Fucking Titanic song.
5019776	5020176	All right.
5023157	5025759	Angel, what song do you think got 79% of the vote tonight?
5026799	5028981	Probably the Avril Lavigne cover.
5029221	5031522	Okay, and what do you think should be?
5031542	5032543	Do you think it's rightfully so?
5033924	5036926	Either that or the Stupid Titanic song, sorry.
5037126	5038427	Alright.
5038487	5040588	Magus, what will be booted off tonight?
5040628	5043810	What should... Sadly, I think Holic will go...
5044614	5046155	All right, you think Holic's going to go tonight?
5046235	5047475	What do you think should go?
5047855	5048956	Definitely complicated.
5049136	5052537	Should have gone, but I have a feeling it's going to be Holic.
5052557	5053298	All right, we'll see.
5053558	5053938	Magus?
5053978	5054538	Momentarily.
5054718	5055679	I will kill you later.
5055699	5056319	What should go?
5056339	5057399	What do you think will go?
5057479	5060781	Not expressing opinion, just Holic should go because it sucks.
5060841	5063362	Actually, we should remove all tech music from this station.
5065143	5066663	Jamie will stab you for that.
5066683	5070505	If Jamie's listening, she's going to come back and shove one of those ferrets right up your ass.
5074224	5074564	Great.
5075205	5078626	Alright, but in all seriousness, what do you think will be voted tonight?
5080127	5080508	Holic?
5082889	5085490	Okay, well I already know who's losing.
5086611	5093735	And with 79% of the vote, the song You... I'm sorry, what's going on over there?
5093755	5095696	They're raping the ferrets!
5097717	5098357	Bastards!
5098717	5099357	Uh-huh.
5099377	5100478	Don't play with the ferrets.
5100578	5101578	Jamie would be upset.
5102558	5103778	Alright.
5103798	5104579	Don't play with the ferrets.
5104599	5106339	You're going to get beat up when Jamie comes back.
5106459	5111080	And I'm the one who's going to be here because two of these bastards live in frickin' the Bay Area.
5112320	5112800	Bastards.
5114441	5114881	Alright.
5115461	5115821	What?
5117561	5118242	Repeat that.
5118442	5119682	Oh, so the ferrets are stiff.
5119822	5120402	That's all I said.
5121102	5122002	Ferrets are all stiff.
5127185	5128527	Okay, Rob, I'll quiet them down.
5128767	5134534	Alright, yeah, would you get those... Would you get that... Get them all shutting up, please.
5137037	5137839	Alright, here we go.
5138179	5143666	Tonight's loser with 79% of the votes is... Complicated.
5152737	5156599	It is gone from this station forever.
5156619	5157839	Bye-bye.
5157859	5162041	That was my little car screeching noise.
5162581	5162901	All right.
5164482	5169624	Okay, so Complicated does get the boot from the station, and you will never hear it on this station ever again.
5169704	5177047	Even if somebody is trying to play Speed 10 in their entirety, they must skip track one, because you guys have voted Complicated off of the station.
5178428	5179128	Yeah, I can strip now.
5180698	5183660	So in celebration, Pixie Dust will be getting naked for you all right now.
5184460	5185901	Oh, except the cam's down tonight.
5185961	5186441	What a bummer.
5187142	5188022	Hey, Rob, where's the music?
5188723	5189163	What music?
5190624	5197347	Oh, I only have... My only stripping song was Complicated, so now I... Rob, you got your show yesterday at RecCon.
5197828	5198268	Wait, what?
5198788	5200269	You got your show yesterday at RecCon.
5202469	5203350	You got my... Oh, yeah, I did.
5203370	5203930	I did get it to show you.
5203950	5204470	I'll show you right now.
5205070	5209912	Arcadian is saying I should delete the file off my computer completely, and I think that is a good idea.
5210072	5211933	So, here we go.
5212173	5213794	I'm going to... I'm currently going in.
5213834	5216695	Here's my Dance Mania Speed 10 directory.
5217075	5219576	I'm going to Complicated, and I'm deleting it.
5220176	5221957	It says, do you want to send it to the recycle bin?
5221997	5222737	And I just click yes.
5223638	5227019	And now I'm minimizing my... So I can get to the recycle bin, and here we go.
5227079	5227579	Wait for it.
5227639	5228079	Wait for it.
5228540	5229360	Oh, wait for it.
5230703	5232284	Erwin, did you hear that little sound?
5232304	5234165	That little paper-wrecking sound?
5234185	5234625	That was it.
5234705	5237687	Complicated is off my hard drive and gone forever.
5242289	5242849	Gone forever.
5243770	5244030	All right.
5246411	5251774	Loki, you had some stuff you wanted to share tonight with DDR Ultramix, since, believe it or not, we are a Bimani-related show.
5253592	5255933	They've already announced what the first song pack is going to be.
5256674	5273762	It's a bunch of Konami originals, starting with DJ Taka with Abyss from 5th Mix, Naoki Burning the Floor from 4th Mix, Tomasuki with Mind Parasite from Dance Maniacs, Mr. T with some guy...
5275814	5285359	Motolake F, Burning Heat 3 Option Mix from Max 2, and Rick, in my eyes, from, I believe that was 5th Mix, 4th Style.
5288961	5290242	And that's it, $5 for 5 songs.
5290642	5290802	Oh yeah.
5293529	5295210	The one on there you guys probably don't know.
5295230	5296531	I think everybody knows Abyss.
5296571	5297992	Everybody knows Burning the Floor.
5298473	5302335	The few you guys might not know, or you may have forgotten what they sound like.
5302395	5304557	Let's hear a little bit here of Mind Parasite.
5304617	5305337	I know I have this.
5307218	5308099	Or at least I thought I did.
5308139	5308699	Maybe I don't.
5308979	5311301	It could have been on Loki's old drive, actually.
5312462	5313322	Oh, shit.
5314203	5315404	Well, don't I look like a dumbass?
5316805	5317745	What's different from any other day?
5317765	5318266	Yeah, I know.
5318286	5319246	What's different from any other day?
5319286	5320027	Ha, ha, ha, ha.
5320367	5321328	I love you all.
5321348	5321428	Bye.
5323098	5330596	Oh wait, no, I do, here we go, this is Mind Parasite, and this is good because this is Tomosuke, who is half of Orange Lounge actually, so this is Mind Parasite.
5359304	5361565	Alright, that is a little bit of Mind Parasite.
5361585	5363186	That's going to be a song that you can download.
5363266	5365727	It's going to be, what, five bucks for this?
5366267	5367928	It's like paying for games on my cell phone.
5367948	5369208	Is it five bucks a month?
5369608	5372630	No, it's just five bucks and you permanently get all those songs forever.
5373690	5379893	The other song I was going to play is In My Eyes, except I deleted my Force Style soundtrack to make room for Final Fantasy XI.
5380253	5380693	So I've got to...
5381940	5382621	I've got to consult.
5382681	5383261	No, you're right.
5383321	5384142	You know what?
5384262	5385323	I am a stupid idiot.
5385383	5386244	It is on 5th style.
5386784	5387885	I'm picturing it right now.
5388105	5389146	Why was I thinking 4th style?
5389426	5389806	You know why?
5389846	5392308	Because I get Love Will mixed up with it.
5393269	5393649	I should.
5393669	5395511	If you want to grab your 5th style soundtrack, go get it.
5397867	5399388	We'll hear you in my eyes in the next break.
5399428	5399808	How's that?
5399908	5401389	We'll just save that for the next break.
5403671	5416079	What do you guys think of this whole... We've kind of brought this up on the show before, but now that it's coming to light and the details are coming out and the song list is coming out, what do you guys think of this whole paying $5 to download songs bit?
5416099	5416640	What do you think of this?
5416660	5417681	Is it a good idea, a bad idea?
5418221	5420342	I could pay $5 to have sex with Rob.
5421243	5421763	Bad idea.
5423544	5423865	Oh!
5423965	5424125	Oh!
5428150	5428990	Haha, you're not funny.
5431071	5433751	Seki, seki, five dollars, we love you long time.
5435111	5435592	Okay.
5435672	5437272	I paid five dollars to get away.
5438472	5440753	What do you think, what do you think of this idea?
5440773	5442973	Does somebody have a serious comment here, Angel?
5444813	5446374	Um, no.
5447054	5449734	You know, we already pay enough for Mamani.
5449754	5456836	If you're like Mamani, you know, addicts like we all are, you know, we already pay enough for like, you know, getting 2DX in our houses and
5457475	5462177	You know, being able to play that because you have to buy another system for that and all that crap.
5462397	5462657	What?
5466139	5469141	Anyway, yeah, so, you know, I mean, we already pay enough.
5469761	5475504	I don't think we should be paying any more because there's something called... Well, Loki knows what I'm talking about.
5482147	5482607	Let's see.
5483766	5489152	Why even bother with UltraVix at all when you can just install Linux on an Xbox and run StepMania?
5490974	5492735	Let's assume not everyone knows how to do that.
5492876	5495258	Not everyone's a nerdy genius like you, I guess.
5497981	5499903	I use that term extremely loosely.
5500083	5500744	Kind of like you.
5501424	5501825	Just kidding.
5501845	5501945	What?
5504409	5505250	Who's the loose one?
5505350	5506130	I'm just kidding.
5506210	5506670	I'm kidding.
5507111	5508031	I love you, Janae.
5508551	5510052	Pixie Dust, don't get pouty with me.
5510573	5512634	I'm going to come show you some love, Pixie Dust.
5512654	5513574	I'm going to show you some love.
5514015	5514835	I love you.
5514875	5516116	I'm going to put my head on your bosom.
5517897	5519098	Somebody get the camera.
5519238	5520919	I love you, Pixie Dust.
5521159	5522039	I love you, too.
5522900	5523580	I'm sorry.
5523600	5524301	Bear it, love.
5524421	5525241	Bear it, love.
5530885	5532786	I can put an Xbox on those tits, man.
5535068	5539011	Yeah, it's good shopping.
5539031	5539991	You know, I love you.
5540011	5540612	I love you too.
5540752	5542092	Bastard.
5545534	5549237	Loki, I know you of all people love to pay to download things.
5549277	5551918	I want to hear your thoughts on the $5 for 5 songs bit.
5553819	5554159	It's just $5.
5554420	5562824	I'd just do it so... Well, if I had the Xbox version or whatever, I might download it just so I can rip them.
5563325	5563485	But...
5564915	5567396	I don't see a problem with paying $5 for five songs.
5567416	5570717	That's not that, you know, expensive for just a one-time purchase.
5570777	5571978	It's just like an add-on CD.
5572978	5576679	Wow, of all people, I was not expecting you to support this.
5578240	5583322	Well, I would do it, but, I mean, not to say that it's not going to be a workaround, because I'm pretty sure that there is.
5583442	5584982	So, you know, whatever.
5587443	5590164	I'll just download them off of, like, Supernova, because I'm sure they'll have it.
5591980	5598024	Do you think people would pay for these when they can go off of Stepmania's many dedicated sites and get it for free?
5599666	5602388	Well, those are going to be the same people that are going to buy the game or not.
5604309	5609453	I probably will because we normally buy the game, but then I rip the songs and I play them on mine.
5610703	5619305	You know, I actually think I'd buy the expansion pack, too, but the problem is I don't own an Xbox, and I still have higher things on my priority list to get, even with DDR coming out.
5619345	5623046	I'm like, ooh, I need a new processor for my computer so I can play Final Fantasy XI.
5623066	5625026	Ooh, I need a bigger hard drive for my MP3s.
5625627	5626607	Ooh, I need to buy a hooker.
5627687	5629528	You bought me last night, Rob!
5629588	5630068	Oh, I'm sorry.
5630308	5633388	Well, I mean, but you from the 99-cent hooker store.
5634389	5635289	I can afford that.
5636639	5638000	It's dark, she knew it.
5638140	5639320	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
5639581	5643182	She had to raise her prices due to inflation in the breasts.
5645484	5647385	Not like that mom and that baby, huh, Rob?
5648745	5649386	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5649826	5651527	Oh, come on, you're not going to tell them about that?
5652587	5653248	Why don't you tell it?
5653268	5654068	You tell it so much better.
5654869	5657970	No, I won't, because now Loki's saying no, so never mind.
5658030	5659351	No, don't listen to Loki, I never do.
5660808	5671873	Well, we were coming out of the grocery store, going back to the car, and this mom comes out with the kid in the cart, and all of a sudden Loki responds with, Oh, look!
5672603	5677105	They sold a kid or something, and the kid was all happy and whatever, and we all busted up laughing.
5677725	5679606	Alright, Loki wants to correct some things.
5679626	5693051	Go ahead, correct it, because I don't... I saw this stupid woman who looked homely with her stupid baby in the car, you know, pushing her around, picking up cans or whatever, and then I'm like, aw, how cute, she's gonna go sell her baby.
5693411	5696492	And the baby was all happy to be rid of her crack-horn mom.
5697192	5701134	Alright.
5703314	5706175	Okay, um, wow.
5707416	5709056	What else is going on in the Bomani world?
5709596	5711317	Loki, what's going on in the sim scene?
5711357	5712658	Anything new in the sim world?
5712678	5714918	Why don't you give us our sim update of the week.
5716199	5719780	DDR Maniacs, this site came up, yippee.
5720540	5730904	And on DDRAmerica.com or whatever, your BitTorrent site, you can find the wonderful Dancing Stage Fever songs, which I played today, and they suck.
5731613	5732434	Surprise, surprise.
5733795	5735116	The end.
5737798	5738138	That's it.
5738239	5738979	Nothing else going on.
5740520	5740761	Nothing.
5741461	5741801	Zilch.
5744344	5744644	Alright.
5745685	5749748	We're going to take a quick break and when we come back we're going to do the FUs of the week.
5750469	5750769	So...
5751953	5757094	Send those on over to private message to Sky in the chat room and we'll be reading those right after this quick break.
5757575	5759975	And all three of these songs have something in common.
5760015	5764856	They may have a different artist's name, but they still have something very much in common.
5764936	5765397	We'll be back.
5766737	5767637	Starting off with In My Eyes.
5767977	5769538	In My Eyes
5893544	5898066	The end is near, the end is near, the end is near, the end is near, the end is near
5934316	5935737	Let's get it!
5935757	5936398	Let's get it!
5936498	5937399	Let's get it!
5946778	5947739	Thank you for watching!
5991694	5992702	Thank you for watching!
6112226	6118088	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
6119068	6120389	Alright, we're back.
6124654	6128237	and it's about time to get into our favorite part of the show, the FUs of the week.
6128257	6130758	But first, we want to make a few quick programming announcements.
6131699	6141786	Vanilla Sky will not be on tomorrow night because I have to do some other errands and with work getting busy and all, I can't stay up late, so I have to take Angel home tomorrow.
6142346	6143327	Yeah, Loki.
6144488	6148130	And unfortunately, with my computer being the way it is and the situation I'm in, I'm
6150290	6154491	and unfortunately unable to do a LiveWire show this week.
6154532	6162574	And that kind of sucks too, but I didn't plan for it to be this way and try and make sure it's not, but the computer's kind of up in the air right now.
6163815	6166896	So instead, Vanilla Sky will be on Wednesday this week.
6167016	6170077	So I'm going to move over to Wednesday this week since there won't be a new LiveWire this week.
6170497	6178320	And tomorrow night, if we can get the computer hooked up tomorrow, I don't know, I'll play an old episode of LiveWire in an increased bitrate.
6178869	6181770	So it'll be like a higher quality stream.
6181830	6184811	So we'll do that tomorrow for Monday night.
6185671	6191353	If we can't get that to happen, we'll rerun an old episode of Vanilla Sky and a new episode of Vanilla Sky on Wednesday this week.
6191673	6193173	Pump up the volume, of course, on Tuesday.
6193513	6194254	Rerun this week.
6194434	6195594	Jamie is still in Alabama.
6195694	6202296	She does get back on Tuesday, but we don't expect her to want to walk through the door and sign online first thing.
6203056	6205439	She's probably going to want to sleep for a little while.
6205460	6206541	So she'll be back next week though.
6206581	6207883	She'll be back Sunday for sure.
6208303	6211187	Season 4 of Orange Lounge Radio debuts this Sunday.
6211387	6217255	And the catch was that we were going to go MP3 Pro on Sunday, but we'll get into that in the FU's of the week.
6219117	6220960	Which it is now time for you guys.
6223171	6225813	Here we go, we are going into the FUs of the week.
6226153	6230215	I have to get a little bit old school this week with the FU music because of Loki's computer being down.
6230255	6232977	I'm missing a few files, but we'll start it off.
6243544	6243944	Alright.
6245740	6248161	Jamie this week would like to give a big F.U.
6248241	6253702	to stupid people and us.
6254002	6254382	I don't know.
6254462	6254802	I don't know.
6254942	6259283	Stupid drivers and things that are pissing her off in Alabama.
6260283	6263264	And I'm sure she misses all of us greatly.
6264144	6265164	So that's Jamie's F.U.
6265184	6268505	for tonight, which I am entering on her behalf.
6269646	6271346	Up next is Loki with his F.U.s.
6272956	6275537	And he still has the Christmas speed music, I promise, two weeks ago.
6278658	6281139	Wish you would have thought of this when we did the cage match, huh?
6285220	6296044	Anyways, uh, F you, or, uh, fuck you to, um, Price, because you suck, because the fact that I had to drive down there to get you to suck.
6296644	6302287	I spent my money there, I come back here, I'm working on my computer, I look at my processor, oh, guess what, they gave me the wrong processor.
6302647	6311892	So I drive another half hour all the way back to Fry's, wait an hour, wait in line for another hour, get a new processor, and drive back.
6312092	6315453	And then finally I tried it in my computer, and my computer worked.
6315473	6321116	My old computer, something happened to the motherboard, you know, when I was installing it, so that didn't work.
6321136	6324738	So I go back to Fry's, and go pick up a new motherboard, and come back home,
6325411	6327192	I wasted four hours because of Fry.
6328452	6329072	Surprise stuff.
6329652	6339075	Then there was this guy today when I was driving on the road who was trying to scratch his ass or something while driving his beat up truck and was like swerving all over the road.
6339635	6343416	Like practically just driving in two lanes at once and stuff like that.
6344036	6346316	So I hate people and they deserve to die.
6346857	6348337	And another thing was...
6349417	6353141	Fuck you, people with cell phones, because your cell phones are going to get taken away pretty soon.
6353161	6356004	You're not going to be able to drive in your car with cell phones.
6356564	6357245	So, guess what?
6357505	6359487	You're going to have to concentrate on the road now.
6360889	6361289	No.
6362370	6362851	Two words.
6363091	6363431	One word.
6363491	6364012	Compound.
6364152	6364613	Headset.
6364653	6367916	So, I just, you know, I hate it.
6368076	6369618	I hate you guys driving me.
6370692	6371373	Thank you for watching!
6388544	6392725	I don't understand why you have to send interns to a stupid competition like that.
6393125	6394786	They have no opinion whatsoever.
6394866	6398907	All they were doing was promoting some god knows whatever concert, and I forgot what it was.
6399227	6400167	Good job on them.
6400507	6401688	Hey, let's get a look.
6402268	6403748	Good Charlotte sucks ass.
6403848	6412451	So anyways, you know, so they suck ass, and the fact that they have 1079 coming to promote their damn show, that's really sad.
6412851	6417812	Then not only that, that stupid guy had no, you know, comments whatsoever, no constructive comments.
6418487	6420929	I brought these people in the first place, so that sucks.
6421689	6422169	Ooh.
6422229	6423270	Ooh, cat fight.
6423390	6425391	Anyway.
6427032	6428754	Well, that's even better.
6428794	6431495	But anyway, yeah, after the fact that my...
6440919	6443600	For some reason, my computer is running slow on the internet.
6443720	6454745	I don't know what the hell's up with our internet right now, and my PC, but the fact that I upgraded the RAM, upgraded the processor, upgraded the motherboard, and everything else does not make it run slow.
6454805	6456685	Why does it run slow when you upgrade it?
6456705	6457546	That makes no sense.
6458206	6460707	So, I have to figure that one out.
6460967	6465109	What the hell is this?
6465129	6467670	This is like some, like, Australian guy singing this.
6474011	6474932	Oh, crikey!
6475532	6476012	It's Rudolph!
6476072	6478154	He's going down in history!
6478274	6479635	Oh, that's awful.
6481276	6487620	Yeah, so that sucks, and... You know, I had lots of money this weekend, now it's all gone.
6488260	6488740	More or less.
6489501	6490482	So that sucks, too.
6492123	6493964	I think I'm done.
6494484	6494844	Yeah.
6495685	6496065	For now.
6498206	6498947	Alright, my turn.
6500572	6502893	Of course, we get to hear Lion Suki again, even though we played it in that break.
6502933	6505095	Which, by the way, was all Akira Yamaoka-related things.
6505435	6508096	Rick, In My Eyes, Dancer, Duval, Lion Suki.
6509217	6510198	All 2DX songs, too.
6511719	6516321	My AFU this week goes to Live365.com, the lovely site that hosts our radio station.
6516822	6522105	That MP3 Pro live shit was supposed to be rolled out at the end of October, and we're still waiting for it.
6523105	6528008	And I was hoping we could have a live MP3 Pro stream starting Sunday, but that ain't gonna happen.
6528048	6528228	Why?
6528248	6528549	Because Live365...
6529838	6531681	I can't fucking get things out on time.
6532162	6535228	I hope we don't get the plug pulled for me ranting on this on Life is Five.
6535248	6537111	But hey, I'm entitled to my right of speech.
6540232	6541333	I'm just a little upset.
6541353	6548318	I'm also upset at them because they're promoting the MP3 Pro thing all over the site when it's supposed to be in beta still.
6548378	6550560	It's not supposed to be something that was rolled out to everybody.
6550620	6556404	I think it's a piss poor thing to do to roll it out when half the people can't use it because the live software isn't rolled out yet.
6556424	6564891	You guys suck that cock and balls and I hope you get your shit done soon before I come to wherever you're at and set your building on fire.
6564911	6566572	You bet, Tom.
6567145	6568927	Yeah, I said come.
6570848	6574811	Let's see, my other FUs of the week go to being single, because being single sucks.
6575552	6583819	And my other FU goes to my job, because as much as I love my job, having to teach two classes at once is going to suck a fat cock.
6584399	6586141	And, oh, I'm going to hug from Janae.
6586942	6589964	All FU to Janae for having a vagina, not a penis.
6589984	6592386	Same thing to Angel, yes, same thing.
6596757	6597798	Just fuck women.
6598319	6600781	Alright, alright.
6601241	6601602	That's enough.
6601802	6605605	If you believe the fuck women, that's the idea.
6606046	6606586	Catch on.
6608087	6608468	Alright.
6610109	6611971	Alright, here we go.
6613012	6614113	Alright.
6615875	6619137	Here comes the chatroom, not chatroom FUs, the rest of in-house FUs.
6619178	6619578	Pixie Dust.
6623033	6626935	F you goes to loaning friends money because they never pay you back.
6627015	6627696	Well, ex-friends.
6628156	6630077	Never pay you back because they're bastards.
6630657	6631998	Or this person is a bastard.
6632939	6634199	And, yeah, that's one thing.
6635060	6638942	F you goes to the search for Miss Applebottom because it fucking sucks.
6639502	6643104	Why the fuck are you going to tell Nelly that you can make your twat clap?
6643585	6645506	What kind of thing does that do?
6649261	6651444	What does it have to do with your butt?
6651484	6652845	What does that sound like?
6653746	6654627	Let me try, hold on.
6655228	6659894	All I gotta say is that it'd be cool if we could do it in time with the Addams Family song.
6660094	6661195	No, no, no, clap.
6661215	6662897	Um, I had one more, fuck you.
6667771	6668952	Fuck you to Loki.
6669352	6672173	I'm going to a fucking good Charlotte concert, you bastard.
6672413	6673593	And I'm glad about it.
6674094	6676935	Go hang out with your 1079 cronies.
6677715	6680256	These are going to be 106.5 cronies, bitch.
6680977	6681837	Oh my God.
6682117	6683198	Like there's a difference.
6683578	6684738	There is a difference.
6685599	6687499	They don't play Eminem on 1079.
6689880	6690841	Fuck Tard.
6692882	6693342	I don't know.
6693542	6694982	Angel just said fuck Tard in my ear.
6695523	6696003	Whoa, wait.
6697068	6697568	I blame y'all.
6698048	6701790	But, I'm, fuck you Ghost Nelly for smacking me on my ass.
6701970	6704631	And, well, no wait.
6704771	6707313	I'm not supposed to!
6708093	6709634	Not supposed to, but I liked it.
6709954	6710374	Yeah.
6711054	6712575	And, yeah.
6713095	6716657	Fuck having big tits, because I'm actually in studio and I can say that with Loki's face changed.
6716677	6717877	I'm like, shut the fuck up.
6717977	6719858	Fuck having big tits.
6720118	6721279	Jerks don't bait, you're right.
6721949	6723650	I'm sorry, those aren't big tits.
6723710	6728611	Big tits are like double G. That's like the stuff that you see on the Amorium.
6728851	6729952	Shut the fuck up.
6731892	6733713	They can hold an Xbox between them.
6733773	6734173	Shut up.
6735173	6737994	Hey, that is so fake, okay?
6738195	6740735	An Xbox can hold a small country in it, okay?
6741856	6745437	I did not really mean you could put an Xbox on those boobs.
6746457	6747498	Controller, maybe.
6747678	6748258	Xbox, no.
6750367	6752668	Fuck, dude, I can't even fit an Xbox in my car.
6752768	6753588	Okay.
6753808	6756450	I'm done.
6757190	6758650	All right, up next, no styling.
6759091	6769595	Dude, I usually have this huge, long FU for Sky, but now I don't have an FU except for those rocks in Sacramento.
6769755	6772196	It's like, fuck you, rocks.
6773316	6773877	Rock on.
6773977	6774857	All right, Angel.
6775677	6777058	Your FU is for tonight, Angel.
6780094	6781835	Stop laughing and rant about something.
6781855	6783396	This is not a funny part of the show.
6783436	6786398	You are not allowed to laugh.
6786598	6787378	Shut up, Rob.
6788539	6790520	PC Dust is balancing DNL on her boobs.
6790540	6792041	That's why we're both laughing right now.
6794422	6795663	But can you crush the can?
6795683	6796784	Angel.
6797124	6801006	Okay, okay, okay.
6801106	6805249	Um... Thank you to my work for not, um...
6806391	6808092	Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time.
6837114	6839576	And, uh, I guess that's it, because I'm not that angsty this week.
6840136	6841137	Surprisingly enough.
6846541	6847181	Alright.
6849363	6851164	Uh-oh, uh-oh, here comes Loki again.
6854206	6859810	Fuck you to the stupid goddamn commercials on the radio about some truck.
6860331	6863733	I don't give a fuck if a black hole does not have a hemi.
6864334	6864674	Okay?
6864694	6864774	Okay?
6866363	6873327	I swear to God, if I was that person in this fictitious commercial, I would have gutted those two people talking.
6873907	6875988	I hated that commercial because it's so fucking annoying.
6876028	6877429	Hey, I got a hemi, too!
6878429	6879210	Look what I can do!
6879390	6881451	How much does that black hole throw?
6881471	6882972	Does it have a hemi?
6883452	6884652	I'm a redneck!
6885033	6889115	Who fucks my own cousin?
6889155	6890475	I hate that fucking commercial.
6890755	6891096	That's all.
6891256	6891536	I'm done.
6893097	6893497	Magus.
6894677	6897739	Alright, this has been keeping me for most of the day.
6898359	6908186	F you to the way that the swap room at Wreck-It-Con was designed, the way they had like the door guards and shit.
6909166	6912569	There was one way in, one way out.
6913109	6918913	You could not, you know, go out for like five seconds and then go back in the same door.
6919073	6922275	You had to go all the way around the building and go back in.
6924412	6925413	is just a pain in the ass.
6925453	6928115	And then they had the long lines at the game room.
6931557	6939602	Then, let's see, FU to Traffic getting into Pittsburgh for WreckerCon and FU to Fog on the way home.
6940663	6941023	That's about it.
6941043	6941644	I'm not that anxious.
6941664	6942124	Well, thank God.
6942164	6943125	I'm glad we left when we did.
6943797	6944277	I hate fog.
6944297	6945418	We took a secret way home.
6945458	6947639	We went like, we went like on these back roads.
6947679	6949599	We went up 4 and then we went up 160.
6949659	6950620	We were like in the wilderness.
6950640	6951500	It was really scary.
6951520	6952761	It's a secret to everybody.
6952781	6954561	We went, we went by a town.
6956282	6959403	We went by a town that has only 60 people that live in it.
6959443	6959944	It was scary.
6962045	6962805	No, it wasn't Susanville.
6963185	6965346	Alright, let's get to the chatroom FUs.
6978661	6979381	Alright, sorry.
6980322	6982223	Captain Canada would like to give an FU to the week.
6982243	6985805	Beer bottle caps for being so impossible to open without a bottle opener.
6986186	6990248	And my roommate and myself for not having bottle opener in our dorm.
6990288	6994911	It took me like ten minutes and a cut hand before I finally ripped the cap off with a pair of scissors.
6994951	6998012	It was like sitting on the pot and then realizing there's no toilet paper.
6999774	7001074	Wipe your ass with a shower curtain.
7006821	7019687	Zodiac Knight would like to send a big F you to his school, the Illinois Institute of Technology, for being such money-grubbing whores who continue to not provide for their students.
7020307	7022508	And if you can't say the school's name on the air, I understand.
7022548	7022848	Oops.
7025349	7026990	Hi, Zodiac Knight, by the way.
7029122	7030764	Um, let's see.
7030904	7037148	EvilNauki2DX would like to say, Fuck Seton Medical Center for not telling us that my grandmother suffers from anemia.
7037208	7042111	Thanks to those asshats, my grandmother is on life support and I have no fucking idea if she's going to live to see tomorrow.
7042572	7045414	Oh, that's too... That's sad.
7045454	7053279	This isn't supposed to be about sad things, but... I just... I hope things go better for you.
7054972	7058777	DJ Spector would like to say fuck you to Speed Mixes, especially Avril Lavigne Speed Mixes.
7058817	7060960	Fuck you to my Spanish teacher Lucretia again.
7061040	7063644	Fuck you to Clock Tower 3, the suckiest game ever.

7076289	7083254	Fuck you to my fan club who seem to show up at the arcade every time I show up and look like they're watching more than just me playing Initial D. They're watching your breasts, of course.
7083855	7092601	F you to stalkers in general because they're giving ex-C9CNME creepy looks in terms of smiling and trying to be friendly when it's creepy as fuck.
7092621	7096143	And F you to midterms because of those I haven't been to be able to go to Orange Lounge Radio.
7098045	7099746	And I miss the Orange Lounge Radio crew, so yeah.
7100857	7110161	XVI, as he's known, is tuning in from Las Vegas tonight and would like to give an FU of the week to the manager of the virtual reality zone at the Adventure Dome at Circus Circus in Las Vegas.
7110621	7113743	That was one of the first places I ever played VR, FYI.
7113763	7120246	They don't fix their Romani machines, so many locals accuse the workers of their being lazy-ass bastards when it's actually the manager who's to be blamed for it.
7120906	7122788	F you to myself for being left out of Too Much.
7122828	7126192	I want to get out of Las Vegas so I can be back with my friends, back with the RTA crew.
7126733	7132519	Also F you to the Las Vegas bus system known as Cat for making such lame excuses and mostly not on fucking time on their schedules.
7135082	7140448	S Ghost would like to say F you to you guys for airing erotic songs when my parents invited over a pastor.
7142415	7144757	Good thing I'm an atheist or else I'd be headed straight to hell.
7145337	7153124	On the subject of religion, F you to that one pastor who wants to put a memorial in Matthew Shepard's town that says Matthew Shepard entered hell, whatever the name, whatever the date was.
7154004	7156366	That's the guy who runs GodHatesFags.com.
7156406	7156867	What's his name?
7156967	7157948	Fred Phelps, I think.
7158528	7162291	And he's a total asshat who's just an attention whore, and that's how he does it, by fag-bashing.
7162351	7167235	So that's why we don't like to acknowledge that he exists, because sick people like that don't exist in my world.
7167976	7171979	Be sure to tune in to his show, The 700 Club, on the Family Channel.
7173088	7177449	Yeah, weekdays at 11.
7177689	7182111	700 Club, great material for having friends over and wanting to talk about something.
7183991	7192333	S-Ghost, F you to whoever made the horrible S-Ghost parody journal on LiveJournal, which is that LiveJournal user, S-Ghost.
7192513	7194734	F you to Good Charlotte and all that punk crap.

7199893	7203414	John Fields would like to say, fuck you to falling down the stairs again.
7203434	7206095	F you to getting sick over the weekend and not going home from college.
7206635	7207515	F you being fat.
7207735	7210996	F you to not being able to find a new free Ragnarok online server to play on.
7211317	7214237	Lastly, F you to all the broken glass on the sidewalks at campus.
7214578	7216278	Someone could get hurt, you drunken bastards.
7216298	7217178	Go to hell, alcohol.
7217218	7218499	I hope I never drink you again.
7219599	7223100	SablerX would like to say, F you to those damn songs in the reverse cage match.
7223480	7225841	And an F you to the Wrecker game room entry exitness.
7227749	7231153	Jahi would like to say fuck Monica for trying to give out STDs to people.

7240243	7243666	Fuck the Bubble Sisters Korean R&B group for being racist pieces of shit.
7243727	7245468	Fuck Nancy and the boys for making that song.
7245789	7248732	Fuck laws that prevent me from giving out Monica's last name, that dirty bitch.
7248812	7249613	Okay, I think that covers it.
7252666	7254206	Monica's a dirty hoe.
7254227	7258928	Fuck that half-Asian guy that won over the totally Asian guy on fucking Russian Roulette.
7259208	7262909	The Asian guy would have beat you down with his Asian powers, so shut up.
7264309	7265029	Asian powers.
7265850	7268150	And we all know it was Lewinsky, of course.
7271131	7278213	Ledford would like to say, Fuck you, the MTV poll and the stupid hail of script kiddies and broken P1 pad on the first 8th mix machine I've played for FU's.
7279481	7282804	F you to commercials showing before movies, especially the RIAA ones.
7282824	7284866	Actually, that would be the MPAA, but same difference.
7285947	7289029	Black Lab would like to say, fuck the rain, I hate riding bikes in the rain.
7289069	7291872	Fuck the initial D noobs at the UCD arcade.
7292552	7295095	They take up space to make it harder for me to get more games in.
7295175	7298117	Fuck my birthday for being on the day before a huge chemistry midterm.
7298177	7299618	I spent my whole birthday studying.

7301720	7303702	Dark Tetsu would like to say, fuck you to the cold bug.
7304346	7307948	Nince would like to say, fuck you to my internet being down last weekend.
7308008	7310910	It went out Saturday and I didn't have it back until Tuesday.
7311551	7313352	F you to things in general, just feeling bitter.
7313812	7316254	F you to Sky for using this song for the chatroom FUs.
7316294	7316994	Hey, fuck you, buddy.
7317394	7318735	And the bad songs continue.
7319636	7320536	That's right, it's Oha Night.
7321657	7324659	RYC3 Rice would like to say, why not fuck you to work?
7324679	7325740	I have to work at 6am.
7326160	7326920	Anyway, hi guys.

7331561	7332642	That was a lot of FUs tonight.
7332662	7334022	There's a lot of people in our chat room.
7334082	7335323	I gotta say a shout out.
7335903	7336464	What can I say?
7337004	7340345	I'd also like to add, FU that I have finals next week.
7340385	7341626	And that's it for the FUs of the week.
7342046	7343227	I gotta say a shout out, Ryan.
7343247	7344347	Alright, shout out from Janae.
7344467	7346268	I gotta shout out to Zodiac Knight.
7346328	7347569	Where's my fucking sushi?
7348069	7349050	I really need some.
7349270	7351691	I'm gonna start stripping any time now if I don't get sushi.
7352375	7353695	God, where is it?
7353835	7355636	He practically lives on the other coast.
7355756	7358077	I know, but he said he'd mail it to me.
7358477	7359257	He's going to mail you?
7359277	7360277	Ew, that would be nasty.
7361158	7364179	I left sushi in the car overnight once and it was all nasty the next day.
7364479	7365659	But he's my sushi pimp.
7366179	7366519	I know.
7367259	7368600	Just make him come out here and buy you some.
7369600	7370460	I've got to give a shout out too.
7370761	7372181	Just because, wait, is Jolly still in there?
7373354	7374575	Hey Johnny, this is Angel.
7375115	7379177	Yeah, I just wanted to say hi and sorry I didn't get to say bye last night because you were dancing away.
7379277	7382939	So, I just thought I'd leave you alone and had to go home and whatever.
7383580	7385020	Anyway, yeah, hi!
7385581	7387802	And hi to Rice too because you said hi guys, so I said hi.
7388943	7392244	Yeah, I'd like to give a shout out to all my homies in CB4.
7392544	7393165	Yeah, peace out man.
7400036	7402198	Oh my god, you guys, I want to give a shout out to Carson Daly.
7402218	7402978	This is so fun!
7403178	7404199	Oh my god!
7404239	7406701	Oh my god, you guys, this is so fun!
7406721	7409483	I want to have 10 million of these babies.
7409843	7412025	It wasn't Carson Daly, it was Justin Timberlake.
7412065	7413225	Now get it right, bitch.
7415007	7415687	That was me.
7416568	7418389	Everybody knows that Lance is the hottest.
7418449	7418949	Oh my god!
7419490	7420210	No, my god!
7420430	7423613	No, Justin is the hottest because he has solo career now and he's like so hot.
7423873	7424914	Oh my god!
7424934	7426535	Oh, my whole cheerleading team thinks that.
7427215	7427756	Yeah.
7427776	7428296	Yeah.
7429671	7440753	Now that we've thoroughly scared our listeners, I think what we'll do is kill ourselves.
7440833	7440973	No.
7441693	7447315	What we're going to do... It's like Suicide Club all over again.
7448315	7448515	Yes.
7450075	7451335	I'm doing that voice the whole night now.
7453756	7454356	Yeah.
7454376	7454456	Yeah.
7455393	7459898	I'm going to do this voice the whole night long because, you know, it annoys people.

8769130	8770892	I've got a plate, so I have a reason.
8771212	8775995	Um, basically, since we're kind of, uh, this isn't a popular segment with our chat room.
8776015	8779877	I think I got the equivalent of a C. I don't know.
8780637	8783579	We'll let one more person go, and then we'll judge where we're at.
8783599	8786521	So, Janae, why don't you, uh, pixie dust, why don't you take over.
8786961	8791544	And, uh, if the chat room says, please, Lord, pull the plug, after Janae, we'll stop this segment.
8791564	8792144	All right, guys.
8792164	8794526	Otherwise, we're putting Loki on stage.
8794546	8796327	Guys, let me explain something to the chat room.
8796787	8804469	You have the lines that dictate what pitch you sing at, so I had to find myself constantly adjusting my pitch.
8804529	8808110	I couldn't, like, go my own way, you know.
8809230	8815072	So, I suck at DDR freestyle, but I can actually sing on my own pretty well.
8816292	8818133	Alright, what song are you going to do, Janae?
8820311	8822212	Oh, she's going to do Nora Jones.

9417509	9418770	We're going to pick for him.
9418790	9419430	Sing tonight.
9420431	9421051	You'll laugh.
9421452	9421912	You'll laugh.
9421932	9422512	You'll cry.
9423533	9425155	It's the feel-good song of the year.
9427977	9428617	I'm coming out.
9429118	9432400	Hit me with your best shot.
9432760	9433881	Hit me with your best shot.
9442449	9451732	No, that's killer.
9453953	9456574	Uh, Nostalin will be singing Wind Beneath My Wings.
9460795	9462936	Yeah, the mic's gotta be really close to your mouth, okay?
9463096	9463736	Alright, here we go.
9465076	9467497	Uh, Nostalin's version of Wind Beneath My Wings.
9467897	9469598	And Nostalin will be singing at the party.
9470666	9471426	Alright, here we go.
9471687	9472327	Oh, yeah, okay.
9472367	9473687	No silent on Superstar TV.
9473707	9474048	Here we go.
9474608	9478070	No silent on Superstar TV with wind beneath my wings.
9478210	9478630	Enjoy.
9481091	9484313	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, us making asses of ourselves on Karaoke Revolution.
9506939	9527145	It must be happy cold there in my soul To never have some light on your face Your word content to let me shine
9530652	9560215	You always walk the step with me So I was the one with the whole body While you were the one with all the strength A beautiful face without a name For so long
9561215	9563737	Thank you for watching.
9592052	9599594	For you are the one beneath my wings But I've got it all here in my hands
9619264	9619824	Yeah.
9620284	9620564	Of course.
9620625	9621205	Oh, wait.
9621265	9621545	Oh, wait.
9655106	9659687	I wish I could be Oh and I, I could fly higher
9688759	9692522	For you are the wind beneath my wings.
9692542	9696485	Because you are the wind beneath my wings.
9696505	9699548	Because you are the wind beneath my wings.
9717483	9726106	NoStylen has failed his song!
9726326	9734228	With 2,146 points, NoStylen failed Wind Beneath My Wings, and Teninga has broken down on stage and cried.
9744691	9745111	All right.
9746292	9747132	Here you go, you guys.
9747713	9748493	This is how it's going to work.
9748513	9749874	You guys are going to vote for a winner.
9749954	9756117	The winner will come back and sing an encore song, which will be selected at random by the game.
9756637	9758618	Unless it's a song that we've already done.
9758898	9760639	Then we'll back out and pick a different one, okay?
9760979	9761480	So here we go.
9761780	9763941	Just put it in the chat room, all in caps.
9764501	9765661	Who you want the winner to be.
9765962	9767622	You can vote for me.
9767982	9769303	I sang Like a Virgin.
9769723	9773404	You can vote for Magus, who sang Power of Love.
9773764	9777905	You can vote for Pixie Dust, who sang... What the hell did you sing?
9777945	9778666	I forgot already.
9779046	9779966	You sang Don't Know Why.
9779986	9780846	You sang the Noah Jones one.
9781266	9784948	And you can vote for Loki, who sang Complicated, at your request.
9785388	9788069	Or you can vote for No Stylin', who sang Wind Beneath My Wings.
9788669	9788989	So...
9790020	9795643	Put all in caps right now who you want to sing again and who will play a random song.
9796344	9799826	We see some Rob, some Nostalin.
9800406	9804328	There's going to be a tie between Loki and Nostalin.
9804688	9805749	That's what it's going to be.
9806569	9807290	I predicted.
9807670	9811312	All right, you guys have a minute to flood our screen with your votes.
9811372	9814754	Sorry against people who don't like flooding, but...
9815382	9820463	But my inbox is already full of your Ask Orange Lawrence questions, which we probably won't get to now.
9822163	9822844	I love Angel.
9822864	9823264	She voted for me.
9823324	9824444	Okay, we see some Janae's.
9824684	9826064	Oh, I'm starting to see some Loki's.
9827965	9830845	No, there's about four lines for Loki.
9831565	9833926	Victor, no styling.
9834726	9835346	Let's see.
9836926	9837867	Loki wins.
9837967	9838567	Loki...
9842606	9844067	I don't know, it's kind of close, you guys.
9844127	9846429	It's between me, Loki, and Nostyle, and what do you think?
9847149	9847910	What do you guys think?
9848270	9849251	Fuck you guys!
9849491	9850952	Fucking didn't vote for me, you cunts!
9850972	9853794	I'm thinking, I'm thinking, you did get a vote today.
9853834	9854995	I did, me!
9856776	9857216	You know what?
9857236	9858237	One fucking vote, you cunts!
9858257	9860258	I'm thinking Loki is the winner, okay?
9860298	9863260	Loki is going to do an encore presentation right now.
9863280	9864801	Loki is the winner!
9865001	9865442	Damn it!
9865662	9866182	Red wine.
9866202	9866462	Red wine.
9866482	9866743	Alright.
9867923	9868504	No, I know.
9868524	9869545	I'm coming out!
9869605	9869905	No!
9872661	9876884	No, no, it's going to be randomly selected by the computer.
9877324	9879005	It's going to be randomly selected by the computer.
9879245	9883267	If it's a song we've already heard, we're going to cancel it out and do a different one because we want to hear something new.
9883848	9884588	Alright, ready Loki?
9886149	9886509	Alright.
9890992	9893613	This is no scoring mode, it's just plain karaoke fun.
9893713	9895314	Actually, no wait, no, we'll do, I'm sorry.
9895835	9898116	No wait, I don't remember how to get it to select random now.
9898866	9899726	Okay, you ready, Loki?
9900266	9902247	We're going to pick one completely at random.
9902307	9905207	Here is the song Loki will be singing as his encore.
9905467	9910248	The wheel is spinning, and it's landing on... It's the end of the world as we know it.
9911188	9911588	All right.
9913248	9913689	Here we go.
9914809	9917349	Loki's singing It's the End of the World as We Know It at the county fair.
9917509	9917869	Enjoy.
9920410	9921130	Why?
9921170	9922090	Let's sing along.
9928962	9930283	Yeah, let's sing along.
9930303	9933565	Yeah, group sing along.
9933585	9934425	I am so not singing this song.
9934445	9936666	I don't like this song.
9936906	9939167	I can't work with this.
9958231	9959072	I can't hit the pitch.
9964415	9965296	They're too fast!
9965476	9967177	Give me a different song, come on, seriously.
9967798	9969539	This is ridiculous, I can't work with this.
9969559	9973162	Alright, Loki is about to fail, it's the end of the world as we know it, and he wants a different song.
9973182	9975103	That means we are going to pick the song for him.
9976604	9978345	I can't work with this, this is too fast.
9986972	9992514	Alright, since Loki failed that song miserably, we're going to pick a song for him.
9992694	9994455	Because we're not going to let him get away with it that way.
9994475	9995956	What do you guys say?
9996036	9996496	Believe?
9996816	9999717	Like a... Girls just want to have a... Alright, I'm coming out.
9999877	10000457	I'm coming out.
10000497	10000857	Here it is.
10001258	10002778	Loki singing, I'm coming out.
10004719	10006139	At the county fair with Teninga.
10006760	10007280	Here we go.
10008200	10010261	Remember, he goes, I'm coming out.
10010461	10010681	You know?
10010841	10011341	You know how it goes?
10011462	10012082	You know how this one goes?
10012122	10012502	Okay, here we go.
10016450	10033582	I'm staying in I'm staying in I'm staying in I'm staying in I'm staying in

10069064	10069985	He's laughing.
10070745	10083132	Stop making me laugh dammit!
10083172	10085633	Breaking out of the shell.
10086413	10089895	I have to shout that I'm staying in.
10090695	10092116	I'm staying in.
10093117	10097219	I want the world to know I'm happy with the pussy.
10099634	10125423	I'm staying in, I want the world to know I shop on the same side of the street I've got to show the world, yeah, I wanna see All my abilities, there's so much for me Somehow I have to make them, just to understand I've got it all in hand, oh how I've got it planned
10126221	10150378	I'm spreading the love, there's more for me to fear And I just feel so good every time I hear I'm singing I'm happy with the females, gotta let it show I'm actually passing this song, that's pretty amazing I think Since I can't sing worth a shit
10154233	10156054	Oh yeah, play that instrumental solo.
10156655	10159756	Oh yeah, oh yeah.
10162358	10168242	Yeah, work in the crowd.
10169903	10171924	Yeah, yeah.

10207427	10208928	I'm sick of this song.
10209149	10211050	You're gonna really die.
10213172	10214593	God, this is long.
10215174	10217476	It just doesn't fucking end.
10217796	10219457	Just keeps on going on.
10222100	10224462	I'm gonna kill anyone in the chatroom that has a recording of this.
10224682	10225743	You're gonna so die.
10226283	10227324	I know where you live.
10228345	10231468	As a reminder, the show will be broadcast this week on Thursday.
10234789	10237932	A score of 6,964 points for Loki.
10237992	10239194	Not even a gold record.
10239874	10241336	There is no justice in this world.
10241416	10241816	Okay.
10243157	10245159	Alright, we're going to shut the game off now.
10245259	10247301	Oh my god, I have not laughed that hard.
10247441	10249183	I laughed so hard my head scared.
10249203	10250925	I laughed so hard I peed, okay?
10251285	10252106	I peed a little.
10253167	10254188	I peed a little bit.
10255228	10261130	I can't with my jaw anymore, so no sex tonight, huh, Rob?
10261830	10263230	Oh, that hurt so bad.
10263490	10264791	Oh, my God.
10267111	10268732	I can't believe you.
10269092	10269672	Okay.
10269912	10271853	Yes, it is.
10273673	10275614	I should have been like, I'm sliding in.
10275694	10276674	You know, that would have been even better.
10276914	10277674	But, all right.
10279275	10279715	All right.
10281295	10286081	Luckily, the one person that Loki forgets has a recording is me.
10286662	10287042	All right.
10289205	10292108	My hair looks so bad.
10292148	10295012	We might run a little bit over tonight, but I don't think anybody cares after that.
10295232	10298076	And to think, you guys wanted to end the segment before Loki sang.
10299534	10300635	I think we should make him sing again.
10301035	10303857	Oh, come on.
10304337	10305818	It should be... Okay, I got it.
10305838	10306958	It's going to have to be a bit.
10307018	10309100	It's the only reason people are going to tune into our show now.
10309780	10312922	It should be a duo between Victor and Loki.
10313022	10313522	You know what?
10313762	10317364	When the Karaoke Revolution expansion pack comes out, Loki will sing again.
10317804	10321286	So, you're my fucking monkey, Loki will sing when I tell you to.
10321306	10322927	I'm just kidding.
10322947	10323708	Dance, monkey, dance.
10324289	10327354	What we're going to do when the expansion pack comes out, we'll do this again.
10328496	10330779	This is more incentive for Konami to get those expansion packs out.
10332181	10332923	As promised...
10337069	10337789	Oh my god.
10340211	10343232	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
10343692	10346974	I have no idea how we're going to follow that segment, but we'll sure try.
10347394	10348955	Will Pixie Dust take her top off?
10349335	10350836	Will Magus take his pants off?
10351316	10351996	I hope not.
10352156	10354337	That would be a side to make me blind.
10355118	10357098	Alright.
10357138	10357659	Here we go.
10357699	10359720	First question tonight, ask Orange Lounge.
10363802	10364562	What happened?
10365122	10366603	Oh my god, I guess I missed it.
10367287	10367827	Here we go.
10369228	10370209	First question.
10371930	10375692	First question from... I can't find... Okay, here we go.
10375752	10380435	Leadfoot would like to know, How did Mobomoga get into Xtreme and which one of you made it?
10381496	10382076	Good, thank God.
10382777	10384998	Mobomoga is by The Orange Lounge.
10385699	10390482	And it got into Xtreme because Konami got cheap and stopped licensing things.
10390742	10391863	One more time, he says.
10392203	10393303	Woo, I saw her boobies!
10393624	10393884	All right.
10394893	10397495	Ledford would also like to know, what happened to Orange Crush?
10397756	10399697	That was kind of a regular segment we had on the show.
10399757	10401739	Well, that's Rice Princess's thing.
10402320	10407064	And since she's not really on the show much anymore, because she spends a lot of time coming over for Vanilla Sky.
10407384	10409906	But of course, Rice Princess, always welcome at the show.
10410026	10412669	And if she comes back, I'm hoping she'll bring some Orange Crush with her.
10413570	10420596	A good substitute would always be Vanilla Sky Video Game Trivia, which you can hear on Vanilla Sky, which is the bad music and video game trivia.
10422401	10422661	All right.
10423963	10424743	So, let's see.
10426605	10432270	XVI would like to know, what songs do you guys look forward to playing on Guitar Freak 10th or Drum Mania 9th Mix?
10433151	10433751	None of them.
10433831	10434372	None of them.
10434472	10436874	It's the same fucking game over and over.
10437415	10439977	Maybe the Weezer song, One Time, for Shits and Giggles.
10440097	10440838	I think that would be about it.
10441018	10443580	I'd like to play Mad Blast, but that wasn't on this one.
10443600	10444321	I don't think it was.
10445702	10446002	All right.
10447384	10448765	John Fields would like to know, Loki...
10449531	10452732	Which Beatmania sim do you prefer, and why do you prefer it over the other?
10452892	10454752	BM98 or Beatmania DX?
10455032	10459973	I don't play Beatmania sims, but I play the emulators, so that was kind of cool.
10460793	10465654	But I was using a, what was it, Beatmania DX, whatever that is.
10466215	10468975	There's actually another one, too, that not many people know of.
10469035	10472716	I can't remember what exactly the name of it was, because I had the link on my old computer.
10472756	10477877	But there's another sim out there that's comparable to Beatmania DX, so...
10478792	10480433	Alright, cool.
10480534	10481754	Question from Jay Kinetic.
10482695	10483936	Astroglide or KY?
10483956	10484377	Astroglide.
10486078	10487399	Pixie Dust says Astroglide.
10489120	10489821	Nelly says KY.
10489861	10491382	Warming liquid.
10491402	10492663	Warming liquid, says Nelly.
10493344	10497167	I say choice number three, ID, which most of you have probably never heard of.
10499048	10499809	Janae knows of it.
10501410	10502891	Anybody else care to answer this question?
10504112	10505113	No, alright then, moving on.
10509238	10515101	S-Ghost would like to know, what package are you guys using for Live 365?
10515461	10518043	I'm trying to start up a station and you seem to have a good thing going.
10518083	10518443	P.S.
10518503	10520724	I won't be playing anything on Sunday night, so you know.
10521464	10527127	Without getting into too many specifics, I can talk about this more with you offline, but we have the personal broadcaster package.
10527187	10530929	We don't run as a commercial station because we don't run our own in-house ads or anything like that.
10531309	10536732	and we don't really have that many people that listen that necessitate us needing hundreds of simultaneous listeners.
10537973	10539414	So we have one of the personal packages.
10539434	10541575	I can give you the specifics offline.
10542376	10544677	He says he wants to do his own station.
10546018	10547319	Hey, sure, why not?
10547359	10548059	The more the merrier.
10548400	10550461	But you start a live talk show, I'll kill you.
10550661	10551261	No, I'm just kidding.
10551662	10552042	I'm kidding.
10553783	10556325	Because they were voting for the song they wanted you to sing, Loki.
10556345	10557025	That's why I have all the PMs.
10558199	10561841	It's one of the personal broadcaster packages and it's reasonable, I guess.
10561981	10564522	Although I don't like the idea of having to pay to do this show.
10564982	10567083	But whatever, we have fun doing it and that's what it's all about.
10568584	10572726	EvilMaliki2DX would like to know, when are you coming over to clean my house and the plumbing?
10573806	10575027	Anytime, anyplace, baby.
10580441	10580822	That's it.
10580862	10583644	I'm out of questions unless somebody else wants to send along a new question.
10583724	10588047	Actually, we probably should start to get wrapping up the show pretty soon here.
10589028	10592611	I'm having a lot of people ask me for a copy of the Karaoke Revolution segment.
10592931	10594252	What do you guys think we ought to do with that?
10595053	10596894	I'm thinking burn it.
10597054	10598295	Sell it on eBay, the highest bidder.
10599776	10600316	Kazaa.
10600497	10601217	Put it on Kazaa.
10601838	10602458	We'll see what happens.
10602498	10603779	I think it could be a good promotion show.
10604560	10607402	Loki and I have been busting our butts trying to get a new website done.
10609489	10610049	Right.
10610609	10615510	And when we have that new website done in our downloads area, we will put that up just for you guys.
10616970	10617630	Right.
10618331	10619631	Maybe we'll have like... You know what?
10619651	10621531	We should get ourselves like a listeners club.
10622451	10624252	An Orange Lounge listeners club.
10625672	10626132	Yeah.
10626612	10628812	Well, we have a message board, but none of us seem to use it.
10628832	10632773	But it is over at KaliBomani.com if you click on the evil board of randomness.
10633453	10635673	Unfortunately, our forums have been a little dead lately.
10636014	10637754	But you can go there and revive them.
10637854	10638634	We certainly wouldn't mind.
10640603	10642424	I'm making a sexy pose for Pixie Dust right now.
10646225	10647866	I was just showing off my pillowy lips.
10648626	10648986	All right.
10650007	10653508	I guess we're going to close the mailbag now for Ask Orange Lodge.
10659662	10662785	That was Orange Lounge, or should I say Ask Orange Lounge.
10663125	10666388	The segment's over now, so don't send any more questions.
10666909	10670272	We hope you learned something really useful.
10670692	10673715	The show's over, so we're going to end the segment right now.
10674396	10674716	Alright.
10678480	10682444	Now's the part of the show where we go around and we get everybody's final thoughts.
10684685	10686967	Let's start with No Stalin.
10687548	10688749	Thank you for coming tonight, No Stalin.
10688769	10689690	I know it was your first show.
10690270	10692152	Kind of an interesting show to have as your first show.
10692653	10694014	I really like the show, you know.
10694494	10694815	Good.
10694995	10696556	Really random and me showing up.
10697277	10697637	It's cool.
10697838	10698338	Good times.
10698518	10699599	Good times.
10699639	10700180	Good times.
10700340	10701301	GT, I like to say.
10701341	10701581	Yes.
10701781	10702302	Your mom.
10705965	10706306	Thank you.
10711574	10713114	Oh, God, that over.
10713575	10714595	Pixie Dust, your final thought.
10715435	10721697	I'm laying on the 23rd Magnus, or 69 Magnus, in a salon right now.
10721897	10723697	I am such a slut, aren't I?
10724037	10725698	But only one comes home with me tonight.
10727278	10727678	Well.
10728638	10729258	That's Rob.
10729819	10730339	Yes, that's me.
10730399	10730919	I get to come home.
10731599	10732659	I'm getting a restraining order.
10734060	10734620	Shut up.
10734660	10735460	You fuck face.
10737282	10739303	Alright, um, let's see.
10740304	10741005	Uh, moving on.
10741685	10743306	Um, Magus, your final thought for tonight.
10743847	10745508	Why'd you have to go ahead and make things so complicated?
10745528	10748490	Angel, Angel, your final thought for tonight.
10749370	10750691	I didn't think of one, damn you.
10751532	10752252	I'm coming out.
10752733	10753633	Oh my god, it's a milkshake!
10754754	10756295	Milkshake!
10756435	10757896	Cheeseburger!
10758036	10759798	Uh, Loki, your final thought.
10760658	10761779	I want to sing it to you.
10762019	10762399	Here it comes.
10762960	10764461	Loki's going to sing his final thought tonight.
10764481	10764561	Okay.
10767515	10768676	No, I'm not.
10768736	10770157	I'm not going to sing my final thought.
10770197	10773139	What the hell is this wrapped around?
10773500	10774220	What the fuck?
10775942	10776322	Anyways.
10776342	10778664	At least it's on my chair this time.
10781806	10783427	Please don't make me sing anymore.
10783608	10786310	I don't... We have an afterbirth coming up.
10787010	10787551	I'm just kidding.
10787611	10787931	I'm kidding.
10787951	10788451	Whatever.
10788591	10789152	I don't care.
10789332	10789692	Fine.
10790032	10793435	If they want to be tortured like that, they're masochists in the goddamn chat room.
10793475	10793835	Fine.
10793855	10795176	Alright.
10795617	10796017	We'll see.
10796698	10797018	Alright.
10798329	10799050	Is that your final thought?
10799651	10800512	I'm done, yeah.
10800793	10805139	My final thought is, wow, I almost peed when Loki sang.
10805179	10806240	That was amazing.
10806621	10810486	Loki has driven me to urinary movements in my body.
10810526	10811207	That is amazing.
10813681	10814742	The final word of tonight.
10815062	10815803	Thank you guys for being here.
10815863	10821147	Next week on the show, season four premiere, Jamie's back in his house and will tell us all about our Alabama trip.
10822088	10829715	DDR Ultramix is out on the shelves and we'll be giving our impressions if we get a chance to play it, actually, and more craziness.
10830475	10834179	Tonight's final word I will give to Pixie Dust.
10834559	10839123	Gets the final word, the one word to sum up the entire show and leave us on.
10843942	10844402	One man, one way.
10844422	10844762	One desire.
10874384	10875685	They went too far.
10876005	10877746	They broke all the rules.
10878087	10880608	One man curled the frog as a pimp.
10880648	10881629	Where's my money?
10883450	10883930	Where is it?
10886872	10887433	One man.
10889094	10889654	One way.
10891876	10892756	What a weird voice.
10892796	10895158	That's the only thing that guy could do for a living, you know?
10895738	10897199	He couldn't be a mechanic or anything.
10898020	10899981	Hey, how much is that transmission going to cost me?
10901262	10902703	An arm and a leg.
10902723	10902903	Thank you.
10907714	10910257	Just imagine having sex with somebody, that'd be hilarious, you know?
10910417	10912740	Oh yeah, the desire in your eyes.
10914702	10917906	The passion between us burns with fire.
10918667	10921130	Oh yeah, one way in, no way out.
10929600	10930561	Same babble.
10931222	10933183	Jean-Claude Van Damme.
10933724	10938588	In the same crap you've seen over and over and over again.
10938608	10943572	I'd love to be in one of those movies.
10944253	10952460	Be like... Crescent Heights was a peaceful community until Amy Anderson moved in.
10953761	10954122	Hello?
10957060	10959181	She went to the police, but they couldn't help.
10959241	10960622	I'm sorry, hasn't done nothing wrong.
10960682	10963504	So she went to Detective Pablo Francisco.
10964124	10964805	What's going on?
10965005	10966526	He's trying to kill me, Pablo!
10966586	10967587	Double the action.
10968867	10970028	Triple the excitement.
10970108	10970909	Get down!
10971349	10972610	More of the excitement.
10972870	10973931	Get down again!
10976332	10979054	With the help of his Mexican girlfriend, Rosa.
10979094	10981235	Don't worry, Amy, we'll kick his ass, eh?
10984697	10985818	Call him late at night.
10989323	10991065	He always can take something stupid and make it cool.
10991525	10992286	Can't he?
10992306	10998853	He'll always be like... In the city, he must fight to survive.
10999775	11001757	He sold tortillas on the corner.
11003719	11005201	And the mob wanted in.
11005821	11008204	I don't know who this guy is, but I want him in his tamales.
11008224	11008805	He's dead!
11010203	11015824	He had one chance, and his chance was to fight back Arnold Schwarzenegger.
11016305	11019445	Listen to me, these are my tortillas and I'm not going to give them out.
11021586	11022466	Listen to me!
11025687	11027867	In a place where they didn't know his name.
11028468	11030408	Mijito, who are those men who came here?
11030428	11031188	What's happening?
11031468	11033749	Listen to me, listen to me, keep your head down.
11033769	11038130	They're trying to take my tortillas!
11050200	11054561	Little Tortilla Boy Thank you very much.
11054661	11055162	Good night.
11055382	11056362	God bless you.
11057102	11058523	Good night.
11063524	11065625	Thanks for listening and we'll see you next week.
