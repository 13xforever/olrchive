Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Lonnie Toss and then some.
Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
Yes, I will spank your child.
If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.
Well, here's to my big opening.
A sphincter says what?
I'm super. Thanks for asking.
You little bitch troll from hell!
What am I doing here?
Nooo!
Dodge this.
Mm-hmm. This is a tasty burger.
Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left!
It's a house? Look!
It's a flesh wound.
Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a polyshorn.
Oh, yeah? Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.
Dark Sakura.
I'm not a sniff
Sky
But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer
Loki
I hate you

starting to feel anti-climatic you know with Jamie not here unfortunately and
just yeah yeah the one thing that's not going to be climactic tonight I think

some sexy things too.
Of course when I'm here.
Also tonight a very special cage match, we're going to change the rules tonight, we're not
going to do what we've done in the past, and I'll tell you why when we come back. No web
cam tonight kids, sorry, but Loki has bought a new computer, which I'm sure he'll talk
about a little later in the show, and because of that upgrade he hasn't had time to set
up the cam, so we don't have a cam tonight, which is a good thing because we are all naked
right now. Very naked. And I have to say, you have such nice breasts, Pixie Dust, you
have very lovely breasts. Thank you. You're very welcome. And plants. Alright, we're going
to start this off, we're going to take a quick break with some music from Dancing Stage Fever,
the new game that came out in Europe not too long ago, some classic songs in there. You
may have heard some of these tunes before, but now if you're in Europe or you have a
way of playing Dancing Stage Fever. You can play these songs. We'll be back.
Okay, we're going to have to cam that, I don't know what's going on, it's stopping going
there, so let's see here.
What I'll do is I'll copy the files over real fast, we'll do it a different way.
Something weird's running with the network right now.
In the meantime, Pasty Dust will do her 900 operator impersonation for you.
Ring, ring, ring, ring.
Hello.
Hi.
What's your name, little boy?
My name is, um, uh, Loki.
What are you into, little boy?
Um, I'm into sex and big things.
What kind of big things, Loki?
Breasts.
What do you like about them?
They're bouncy.
You're pathetic.
Get off my line.
Flick!
Um, yeah, something weird's going on.
The network's running really slow today, so I'm not able to run things off the network
very well.
Yeah, it's because we have a lot of stuff going through our network right now, so sorry
guys.
That's all right, we'll be okay.
If you want to join our chat room and join in the big orgy that's going on in there,
on over to our website www.calibomani.com. Click on Orange Lounge and click on Chat.
And okay in this break we're going to hear it starting off with Asa Bass with All That
She Wants will be the first song we hear from Dancing Stage Fever and then some more stuff
that you may or may not recognize. So okay now that it's copied over to my drive let's
try this again. We'll be right back.
When she woke up late in the morning light And the day had just begun
She opened up her eyes and thought Oh, what a morning
It's not a day for words It's a day for catching time
She was lying on the beach and having fun She's going to get you all that she wants
All that she wants Is another baby
All that she wants Is another baby
All that she wants All that she wants
Oh, how a journey it rides And it's time to pull up the radio
With a billion hearts in common now Oh, how a journey it rides
And it started from the radio With a billion hearts you wouldn't know
I'll never be twice
Sign along, oh baby
Oh, you're not so brave
But you're there with the same hope and terror
Guess who just got back today Them wild night boys that had been away
Haven't changed had much to say But man, I still think them cats are great
They were asking if you were around How you was, where you could be found
Told them you were living downtown Driving all the old men crazy
The boys are back in town, boys are back in town
I said, boys are back in town, boys are back in town
Boys are back in town Boys are back in town
Boys are back in town Boys are back in town
Boys are back in town again
And hang it down at Nemo's The boss will take us down again
Hi this is Mel B of RTF and for an extra $1.99 a minute my girlfriend Mel B can join us on
You guys have played karaoke revolution yet once you guys unlock the song one week
We haven't done it here yet because I've been lazy and I haven't played karaoke revolution all week
But once you unlock the song one week, apparently you get a video with it and in that video Mel makes a cameo
He's I guess it's all these different people singing the song or something like that and he's in it. So
Be on the lookout for that. Yes angel. Um, actually my friends
his friend is actually in the game. He actually did voice for the game. His name is Bert.
I only know his first name. Do you know what he sang in it? The Eagle Eye Cherry Song.
The what? Oh, Safe Tonight? Hey, I can get a good squaw on that one. Maybe because Bert's
helping you see. Maybe if we get bored the last segment we could fire up Karaoke Revolution
and see who's an all-star here. Because I haven't seen it yet. Maybe. We'll see how
how desperate for material we get. We'll see. Desperate? Who says we're ever desperate?
It's episode 69. We're very, very desperate. Speaking of desperate, hey Andrew, how you
doing? Wonderful. I ain't desperate for nothing. Oh, really? How about a good joke? Alright,
In that break we play a bunch of stuff from Dancing Stage Fever, Feces, and in Dancing
Stage Faces we have Asa Bass with All That She Wants, Dexi's Midnight Runners with Come
On Eileen, and Thin Lizzy with The Boys Are Back in Town.
Maybe later on in the show we'll play some of the less good tracks from it so we'll see.
Even though it's episode number 69, I figured we'd start the show off as we always do with
a little bit of how was your day, how was your week.
So let's go around and see how everybody's day and their week was.
I will start tonight because I never started this segment off, so I'm going to start.
Yesterday was the one and only, for those of you in NorCal, Recacon, which is a small
convention they did at a community college for anime and video games and all that dorky
fun stuff.
They did this at a community college in Pittsburgh, California, which is in the East Bay.
And this was my very first anime convention.
pixie dust just had her period right through her pants that is amazing what the hell did
you do pixie dust give her a mic give her a mic oh it's definitely sorry the sour sauce
fuck you fuck you fuck you that wasn't even a joke did you catch that he just made another
nun myself so it's not really that great i just looked like it was a painting so it's okay it just
It just looked like she got rammed so hard that she's bleeding right now.
What am I going to talk about last night, Rob?
Well, they missed by a long shuck because that's your thigh and nowhere near where it
needs to be.
Well, right here, you know.
Anyway, Rekacon, hello.
I think we have people listening today that actually went to Rekacon yesterday.
So hello to all our new listeners that were at Rekacon yesterday because I hoard out the
the station and business cards and Jahi, bless his little heart, let me get on the mic and
kind of plug things too. So that was very nice of him. Thank you, Jahi. So, what did
you guys think of Rekha Khan? Did you guys have a good time? What kind of stuff did you
guys do? Anything you saw for the first time, got to play for the first time, things like
that? No silent. I just walked around, man. You just walked around? You were just there
for the people? That's like me. Yeah, basically that's it. That's like me. There hasn't been
any DDR tournaments in NorCal really lately. There was one a couple weeks ago that I couldn't
go. So this was kind of like a chance for me to see everybody because I haven't seen
them in a long time. So, did you get to play any new interesting games or did you buy anything
at the expo or anything like that? Oh, it's completely broke and I thought nothing was
necessary. Blah. I have to ask, no milkshakes? No, no milkshakes. Oh, okay. None at all.
None at all. What the fuck? Yeah, I find that weird, you know, just everybody comes up to
I'm just going to say it, your online personality and your in-life personality are so different.
So, so different, no stylist.
I mean, not that it's a bad thing.
I'm just saying.
Now it looks like I peed on myself since I tried to clean it up.
Fuck!
Why don't you hand the mic off to Angel over there.
Hey, Angel.
Angel, what did you think of Wrecker Hunt?
Sweet.
Did you get to play any new games for the first time or do anything?
I got to see the, did somebody just say that Janae had a maxi period?
That was horrible.
Die.
You're lucky I know you are, unless I kick your ass, you're sick.
Anyway Angel, yesterday, Rekha Khan.
Let's see. God, I almost spelt that away on manga, but, um, I resisted.
It was your poor. I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.
Um, not really, but, yeah, I mean, there's better things I should be saving for at the moment, so.
Um, yeah. So is life. Excuse me.
That's cool.
Anyway.
Did you meet anybody new yesterday you hadn't met before?
Jahi, Mr. Wendell, obviously no stylin, Iwanaki2DX, StaplarX, and a bunch of their friends who came over.
So yeah, that's a lot of people.
Okay. Let's see, what about Magus? Magus, what did you think of the 69th Magus? What did you think of the Rekka Khan yesterday?
Rekka Khan was just plain awesome.
And did you get to play anything new for the first time that you haven't played before?
I got to play Taiko no Tetsujin. I got to play that new Dragon Quest Slime Morimori Adventure.
Yes, the Dragon Quest with the real sword. That game looked so sweet. I didn't get a chance to play it.
It was the most popular thing in the game room and everybody was kind of crowded around it, but it looked really cute.
I just wanted to play it, but I love the way the enemies are drawn.
They updated all the whole enemies, like the slimes. Well, not just cel-shaded, but they made them look sweet.
I don't know if they did the redone, it looks good, it plays pretty well.
I was kind of surprised though, I was thinking that the Dragon Quest sword game was going
to be just like, somebody had told me, oh it's just the very first Dragon Quest except
you use the sword as a controller.
I was like, well that's kind of weird, but it's actually this whole new original game.
It kind of struck me as like a super scope game to me.
It looked a lot like a game you'd be playing with a super scope, where like you'd be shooting
the slimes but instead you use the sword.
So that was fun. Good times.
We got to meet a lot of new faces. Basically met everyone that Angel met.
Yep.
We had a good time. We watched some AMVs in the video room.
What were some good music videos you guys saw?
The chibi things that kill.
Uh huh.
A complete waste of six minutes and forty-five seconds.
Okay.
And this one too, In the Navy, where they started spoofing all these battle cruiser
animes.
Interesting.
Okay.
Cool deal.
Um, so yeah, Wreck or Crawl was just, it was great, it was my first convention, I've never
been to any kind of anime or geek convention, really, ever, unless you count wacky horror
conventions, those are kind of geeky.
But actually, that's more of like a sex thing, because people get laid at those, except me.
Anyway, but ironically enough, the Rocky Horror Convention was the very first place I ever
played DDR.
Anyway, that was my first non-RockyCon, and good times.
I just like getting to see people.
I don't know much about anime.
I don't really watch a lot of it, admittedly.
I'm one of those few DDR players that just... I've seen a couple Miyazaki films and
I watched Pokemon back when it was cool, but I haven't really gotten as into anime.
I kind of rely on Jamie for all that.
She's really into anime, and she just kind of tells me what's good and what's not, and
And Loki being the hookup also knows some good and not good things.
But I saw a lot of great cosplayers.
There were some cute cosplayers.
There was a lot of Final Fantasy cosplayers, and I'm always a sucker for anything Final
Fantasy.
And there were some X2 characters.
And there was a whole little group that had like a squall and a yuffie and all this stuff
in it.
It was really cute.
One thing that made me very happy is that there was a Mai.
Somebody came dressed as Mai from Final Fight.
me happy.
Link was cool.
Oh yeah, they had not just one, but two people dressed up as Link, which I thought was cool.
They actually had a Link and a Saria.
Later on, after the cosplay, they had karaoke.
So we had a guy dressed up as Zelcine invoke rather well, too.
And if you've ever been to an anime convention at all, Ramen and Rice had shown up to this
one as well.
Oh my God.
Now people tell me Ramen and Rice are at every single anime convention in the area, so it's
kind of like, but this is the first time I saw them, and I was like, they are so cool.
These girls play like everything on their violinists.
I want to get some of their stuff for the station.
I should email, do some emails.
I'm a violinist myself, and they're awesome.
Oh, I would have thought you were a pianist.
No, but I have one.
Crap.
Be more funny.
Follow your own advice.
Anyway, we wound up requesting, like, butterfly and scars of time from people across.
Damn you, damn you.
And you're the one that got them to play butterfly.
Yes, I'm the one that got them to play butterfly.
I hope you die.
I hope you die and you burn in hell.
Just kidding.
It's pretty hot in this room already.
Walked right into the pianist's quip, didn't you, Magus?
I would have given my left nut to hear them play Scars of Time.
I'm so sad I didn't stay around for that.
I bet it kicked ass.
Oh, I did and I still have mine.
I did hear them play some stuff from Final Fantasy X, though, which made me all horny
because it was great.
Well, uh, see, at the time they played Scars of Time, you hadn't gotten there yet, Mr.
Fashionably Late.
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, bitch.
I'm just kidding.
Love you.
Oh, really?
come back an hour later and there he goes, he's still going. He's the man, he's the man.
You've got to come up and be on the show sometime. Anyway, so also on How Was My Week, How Was
My Day, something worth noting, talking about is this thing that I did on Thursday. I got
asked to promote Orange Lounge Radio in a way at this local high school. I judged a
local high school's American Idol-style competition, and it was very interesting. I don't know
if anybody from there is listening tonight, probably not because they only mentioned the
station like twice, and I only gave out one business card to the guy who I thought was
most talented out of everybody, mostly because he wrote his own music, and it was fucking
funny. It was something like Adam Sandler would have done, and I'm actually in talks
with him right now trying to get a song of his to spin on the show so you guys can see
what I'm talking about, but it was very interesting because it was me and two interns from one
of the local Sacramento stations, or I don't know, they work in the promotions department
or something like that, and two teachers.
So it was supposed to be like all these local celebrities and I was going to be like the
nobody but I ended up being the only one that actually was on a radio program of any kind
so that was kind of interesting.
I also ended up being the asshole judge because I was the only one willing to say anything
remotely constructive about anybody, because everybody, all the other judges are like,
Oh my God, you're so great, you're just like Claire Aiken, you're better than Claire Aiken,
oh my God, you should be an American Idol, okay?
You have an awesome voice.
Yeah, and then the one guy was like, you have an awesome voice, you are gonna go far, and
then the next person was like, you're gonna go so far, because you have an awesome voice.
And then the next person would come up and go,
you have an awesome voice, and it's going to take you very far.
It was the same thing for everybody.
You have an awesome voice, and it's going to take you very far.
If it's going to take you so damn far,
get your ass out of the room.
And then finally, it would come to me, and I'd be all,
you brought your words up on the stage,
and that looks really tacky type thing.
And then there was another girl.
This was the one that pissed me off, though.
This was weird because I haven't been back to high school in a long time.
This was the first time I'd kind of...
Shut up.
Shut up.
I graduated in 96.
Fuck you.
I really didn't think so.
Seven years ago.
Bitch.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You thought.
Well, you need to think more next time.
I'm just kidding.
I love you.
I've been a bad girl.
You've been a bad girl.
I'm going to punish you.
I haven't set foot in a high school in a long time and I remembered why.
There was this one girl up there who I guess she wasn't that popular or something because
she did her thing.
She was singing Hit We With Her Best Shot and she was doing a good job.
I would have liked to have seen her get into it a little more, but she had a lot of courage
to get up there on stage and she was having fun with it.
It looked like she had a lot of fun with it.
And of course it goes, and the first person goes, it goes, oh my God, you were really
great.
You're just like Kelly Clarkson and you're going to be better than her.
And then the next person got up and goes, you have a totally awesome voice and it's
It's going to take you so far in life.
And then somebody else in the audience goes,
these people in the audience start yelling, liar.
And while it was mildly amusing, I was like, OK, that's
fucked up.
And you shouldn't do that when this poor girl's getting up
on stage making a fool out of herself for your entertainment.
So the mic got over to me and I said, hey, you know what?
Girl, you've got a lot of balls to get up here on stage
and do that.
And you're going to be able to accomplish a lot of life
unlike some of these people who will
be sitting in the dark forever.
and then the guys in the audience were like,
blah, blah, blah, blah.
And the teacher next to me leaned over and said,
thank you for saying that.
And that made me feel good because I hate assholes.
I hate them.
And those people in high school were just like the ones I hated
and would call me fag all the time and stuff.
And they need to like burn in hell because they suck.
I don't care if they were right, Nelly.
It doesn't matter.
That's beside the point.
You're missing the point.
Anyway, that was my week and my day.
Loki, how was your week of your day?
downloading off the internet I'm only getting like one kbps so it's like I don't get it
so I don't whatever it's fine I guess but it's no got a larger hard drive and I have
a computer for my cabinet but I had to go to Fry's a lot this weekend that sucked and
yeah that's pretty much it went to that thing that Rob was talking about and that was okay
And yeah, I didn't do much.
My week was awesome.
It will take me far in life.
Yelled at people today.
Mostly Andrew.
Yeah, that's about it.
I didn't do much.
OK, let's hear from some of our guests then, Pixie Dust.
I know you got a lot to say.
How was your day?
I didn't have my period on my pants.
It was Peter Sauer's song, god damn it!
But before that, how was your week? What did you do this week?
I haven't seen you in like two months.
I know! I've been flawed.
It made me sad.
No, I didn't!
I made you relieved that you didn't have to pull up with me.
Oh, shut up.
Well, how was your week? What did you do?
What did I do this week?
I fucking don't know!
It just went by!
Or should I say, who did you do this week?
There's this strange guy behind me,
Yeah, he's been kissing me all weekend long, so I don't know.
I picked him up off the side of the road.
Did you?
Yeah.
How much did it cost you?
You're pretty cheap.
You're like five cents, right?
No, seriously, school work has like, occupied all my time, so I haven't been doing much
of anything except been home on the phone.
Have you gotten out to play any Bamani recently or anything?
No.
Now, we haven't had you on the show in a long time.
you ever pick up Max 2 for the home? No comment on that. Oh, I see a little bitterness there.
I have a little bitterness towards sending someone. And you guys all know. I won't say
no more. I don't know, who is it? It's you! You bastard! And basically, this fool came
up to see me. And you went to Rekordkon, yes? And I went to Rekordkon. And I called in sick
to work. Shame on you. You called in sick to work to go to Rekordkon? I called in sick
to work because Victor came up. Oh, I see. Not to see your asses. Oh, I see how it is.
No, we, no. Shut up. Bitch, pass that mic. Just kidding. It's mine now. She almost said
what I want. You're an ass. You're an ass, Victor. But yeah, it's been good. I miss you,
The chat room was reminding me of a good thing that happened at the con, something kind of
funny.
Richie, EvilMaukie2Dx, one of the folks at Frigous Art Chat Room, he caught on fire!
No, I'm kidding.
He did not.
No, I'm kidding.
God people.
You're gullible.
Look up gullible.
He had this sign that said, I like maids.
When I first saw him there at the con, we were all outside, and Richie, I think I saw
a maid cosplayer inside and it was just like, boom! Have you ever seen one of those Roadrunner
cartoons? That was like Richie. There was a maid cosplayer inside. No one noticed me.
I was surprised. They did. A lot of people don't know who you are. They don't know you're
the Orange Lounge. Madam. Yes, I am. I'm the only one with a foot behind my head. That's
all it is. They gave me that. No one noticed me. I guess I was playing the other day. Anything
exciting today? Hmm. Cake. And fried Twinkies. Alright. No Stylin. Let's hear from No Stylin.
I know he doesn't talk much in person compared to online, but we'll try to get something
I'm two different people from online and real life.
It's okay.
I'm just making this observation.
I would be a little scared if you were kind of bouncing off your walls and changing your
nickname every five seconds like you do on IRC.
That's okay.
Multipersonalities, yeah.
It's all good.
Do you have any shout outs you want to give while you're here?
Yeah, Dennis wanted to give a shout out to his homie Maple, I think, from Stockton.
That's it.
listen to the show, I don't think, but that's okay. I'm teasing, I'm teasing. I always think
that nobody listens to the show. Well, how was your week? What did you do? Let's see,
came up this weekend, met a special person, you know, really cool, nice, lovable, huggable.
Oh, just talk about Angel all you want. Okay, I realize it's episode 69 and all, but let's
not make me barf, okay, from all this lovey-dovey chat, because I'm the only single person in
this room right now, who's not dating someone else in the room, so I feel really like a
seventh wheel right now.
Okay, I'll tell you this.
What happened?
All right.
Coming back from Hollywood video, first time coming to Sacramento and everything, and whoever
designs these layouts for these stores and malls, this huge rock, I ran over this rock
and I was clinging in mid-air.
It was hilarious.
We were hovering.
Oh my God, a rock.
I was on the passenger side and I was like, what the fuck did you hit? I thought it was
a fire hydrant. Well, that was interesting. But it was like, oh shit. So, that was interesting.
Well, I'm taking your time. That's cool. And that's pretty much my day. Or week. Alright.
Angel, how was your week? Hi Rob. Hi, how are you? Good. Didn't your local
Did you get a new Bimani game recently?
Percussion Freaks
Percussion Freaks? No, not Drum Freaks, but Percussion Freaks
Well, it's Drummania, but I mean, it's Drummania
I know, but it's a different name, so that makes it worth talking about
Well, I suppose it's a different name, except for the fact that it still says Drummania on the stupid machine
Have you gotten a chance to play it at all?
No
Oh, well then fuck it, tell us about your week
Um, let's see, I pretty much worked all week except for like school on Thursday, which
I was sick for, so I didn't go, but that's okay, um, then I just pretty much waited out
the rest of the week until I got here, so yay, huh, anyway, I'm gonna be boring now,
boring and monotoned and neh.
That's pie!
Pie!
Yoo, pie.
Mmm.
Pie.
Andrew, the 69th magazine, how was your week?
How was your day?
Uh, week, long and hard, like, never mind.
Over.
Over.
But I kind of went through the motions of just going to school, yes, I'm making all
these terrible puns, and just went to school, went home, went to school, went home, went
to school, went home, went to school, went home all week, and finally Saturday rolled
around, went to RecCon, and wee fun.
So the rest of the week with Boring Weekend is just all hyper and happy and shit.
If I do the 5, 6, 7, 8 song one more time, I swear to...
Oh shit!
No, not twisted earth!
You should see, Nellie, you should see what else I can whistle.
I can blow these lips very well, Millie.
He's quite talented at the meat flute.
Have you ever heard the milkshake song, the ghetto milkshake song?
Alright, we're going to take a break and when we come back we'll talk about some more Bamani
and I think we will have ourselves a cage match.
But the rules for the cage match tonight are a little bit different.
I'll be in the cage actually dancing topless.
No, so stay tuned for that, because we're going to have ourselves a cage match when we come back.
And we'll talk about a whole bunch of other stuff, too.
This break, we're going to do a segment of a bunch of Mr. T songs, because Mr. T rocks.
And I'm not talking about I pity the fool, but I'm talking about
I pity the fool who tastes my gold chain.
about that other Mr. T, the one that we all know from
We'll be back.

For the step squad of Orange Lounge, this media stops on the phone with the winners at the site PS.
GTPO.
I mean, all right, we're back and you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 69.
And as promised, we're going to get into a cage match here very shortly, but I thought
this was worth talking about this week.
Loki, I know you've been somewhat involved in this.
There's been this movement going on lately, MTV is holding this contest, and they are
naming the best game of the millennium.
Now of course we're only three years into the millennium, but they're going to name
the best game of the whole damn millennium anyway.
Up for nomination, DDR.
This is an MTV and electronic gaming monthly.
Also up for nomination, Halo.
The Final Fantasy series, the Super Mario series, yada yada yada.
Loki, tell us more about what's been going on trying to flood the channels with votes
for DDR.
That's really stupid.
MTV is, you know, they're really genius and they allowed people to vote more than once
for their game. So obviously that opens it up for, hey, let's make a script and I'm going
to go ahead and vote for my game millions of times. And so that's what everyone did,
at least the people that are voting for Halo and DDR. So this went on for like two days
and then finally MTV closed their polls and they're like, okay, find out the results on
January 2nd. Okay, so that, we thought, okay, they're done. So, pretty much, you know, Halo
and DDR are going to win, you know, according to that. And DDR was in the lead. Then for
some reason, people thought you could still vote after the polls closed. So, they kept
doing it and doing it and doing it. And finally, they opened the polls again, supposedly changing
their script or their, like, webpage or whatever, their submission thing, so that you can't,
you know, do this multiple voting thing. Yet, it's still getting through. So, to be honest,
I don't know what they're doing and I just don't care anymore.
I was doing it in the beginning, you know, helping out, but now I just don't care.
It's stupid.
Well, if you want to help out, you can go over to MTV.com and do the votes that way,
or you can keep an eye on DDR Freak because the admin of DDR Freak, J-Dog, has been writing
several scripts to kind of auto-vote.
So if you want to, you know, help DDR out and make it the number one game, go ahead
and do it.
But, you know, I could give a shit because MTV polls suck.
I have seen this exact same thing happen before, exact same thing.
An artist I really like a lot was up one year as a nominee for the MTV Viewer's Choice Awards,
and they did voting online, same way.
But this time you could see the results as you were voting.
And somebody wrote on the web board for this particular artist, somebody wrote a script
that would auto-vote.
It wasn't like a program, but it was a web page that would refresh like 10 frames over
and over again with the voting page.
So we had this artist up to 98% of the vote for the Viewer's Choice Award.
And the day of the MTV Awards, they posted a message on there that said, well, this person
won the web vote, but we're only going to count the phone votes for the real award.
So stay tuned tonight and see who wins, and a completely different person won.
So MTV, you know what, if they want to just throw out the web votes, they'll do it.
And what they're going to do is they're going to keep all of the advertising dollars for
all those banners that loaded.
Because think of it, every time you refresh that page, that's like three more banners
average because MTV.com is full of logos, three more banners that load. So you vote
a million times, you're giving MTV a thousand dollars from all that refreshing. So, kind
of something to think about. At least that's the way I look at it. You have something to
say, Pixie? Well, you wanted something more pathetic than that? The search for Miss Applebottom
on VH1, where they're searching for the woman with the perfect butt. And the choice host
of that? J-Lo? Nelly. This Nelly? Not this Nelly. Nelly with the bandaid on his eye.
It's getting hot in here. It's so pathetic, there was nothing but big booty black girls
and adult models there. I would have thought J-Lo would have been a judge on that show.
She has the queen of all butts. I have the king, she has the queen. I have a king-sized
are you the flying duchess yes because it's so wide i'm like i like sarah ferguson i have
like a wide ass yeah i like how you throw that unlike sarah ferguson well you know what's
weird is that they're going to be doing that partridge family redo pretty soon too i mean
mtv aren't you in that vh1 is a network i'll watch occasionally because they actually play
some good videos. This is how I know I'm getting old, because I prefer VH1 to MTV. The music
on MTV I don't like, as much as I like the music on VH1. It's like, oh God, am I getting
old? Because I prefer the station that plays things that skew a little bit older, like
Sting and Coldplay and- Sarah McLachlan.
Sarah McLachlan, and bands that don't play on MTV a lot. I'm like, am I getting old?
So this is one reason I don't care about the MTV poll, is that I don't watch MTV, so I
Are you willing to bet that Grand Theft Auto Vice City wins, no matter what?
That's the thing, because it's trendy to like a Grand Theft Auto Vice City,
and it would be like avant-garde for MTV to give the award, because we're going to give the award to a controversial game
where you shoot hookers, where you fuck the women and then blow their heads off.
That's going to be the best game of the millennium. That sums up 2003 right there.
Grand Theft Auto III.
It's just going to be summary targeted.
I just don't like MTV.
Well, there you have it. There is that poll and it exists if you want to go vote in it.
You know, it would be nice to see DDR win something.
But I think people out there are thinking that,
Oh my gods! If DDR wins this poll and we get exposure on MTV, the Konami is going to make a new mix.
6.
Okay, the exposure of DDR to anybody on MTV was that stupid fucking Wade Robson commercial.
That's all they fucking know.
All they know is Afro Man and fucking all his stupid shit like, oh you have to go up
and do it and to the side.
I'm like, I don't want DDR on MTV.
I don't want those people playing my game.
Stay off my dance pad.
Get off.
I like those little girls that come in.
The new thing is going to be karaoke revolution.
Goody fucking goody.
No styling has something he wants to say?
No.
Well, don't tease me like that.
Oh, but Rob, you love to be teased.
I do like to be teased.
We'll talk a little more about karaoke revolution
and things like that after this cage match we're going to have.
Now, as I promised, tonight is a little different of a cage
match and because it's a different cage match we have different music.
So tonight we are having what's called a reverse cage match. The reason why we are having a
reverse cage match tonight is because Jamie left for Alabama and assumed that her song
would win for two more weeks and forgot to give me two more songs for cage match. Or
Or if she told me, I forgot, and it's my bad.
So what we've decided we do tonight is we table the cage match, because we all know Loki's song probably would have won again anyway,
because he won last week with Battle Without Honor or Humanity, the 88 severed lens mix,
which we'll play later in the show for those who...
Oh shit, no I don't.
I guess we won't be playing it later in the show, because I don't have the MP3 of it.
Oh my God, it's a cheeseburger!
Anyway, I guess I can't play because I don't have the MP3 of it,
Unless somebody in the chat room I send it to can send it back to me, because it was on Loki's old computer, which is not operative right now.
Anyway, tonight in the reverse cage match, this is what's going to happen.
Loki and I between, we're each going to put in two songs that we believe are some of the worst things we've ever heard.
And they're going to be Bamani or Dance Mania related in some way.
And you guys will vote for the absolute worst song that you heard, and the loser will be banned from Orange Lounge Radio indefinitely.
You will never hear this song on the station ever again. Ever. We will ban the song. It's gone.
Alright, so Lucky and I are going to pick two songs each, so you're going to vote for the song you hate the most.
The song you want to leave tonight. Alright, so that's the reverse cage match.
instead of picking a song to win and be in rotation all week long, you're going to pick for a song to lose and be banned indefinitely.
Alright, so first up is going to be my first pick, and it's actually a song from Dancing Stage Fever.
How exciting. This is a song that you can actually dance to in Dancing Stage Fever, so even if it gets banned from the station indefinitely,
you'll still be able to play it if you really, really want to.
Here's my pick for tonight's reverse cage match to ban from the station. It's the Spice Girls with Wannabe. Enjoy.
You'll tell me what you want, what I really really want
No, tell me what you really really want
I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want
No, tell me what you want, what you really really want
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
I'm gonna really really really wanna
So you say ahhh
If you want my future, forget my past
If you wanna get with me, we'll be making ministry
Now don't go wasting, my precious time
Sean, get your actually every week to be just fine
I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want
Don't tell me what you want, what you really really want
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna Really really really wanna do the thing
If you wanna be my lover You gotta have with my friends
Making life forever Friendship never ends
If you wanna be my lover You have got to give
Taking it too easy but that's the way it is
If you wanna be my lover
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta
Make the last word for the Lord
Come you body down and wind it all around
If you want to be my lover
Alright though, song number one in tonight's reverse cage match for worst song ever to
be banned from the station was Spice Girls with Wannabe.
Let's go around and see what people thought of that and rate it on a scale of one to ten.
Pixie Dust.
All I gotta say is, I have ScarySpy's hair, so I love that song. Damn it. Reminds me of my youth, you fuckface. Damn it! Fuck you, I want that song.
It's my favorite song, so a one.
Well, if you give it a one, that means you think it's bad.
Oh, I gave it a ten!
Alright.
I thought we were doing it in reverse.
Okay.
I thought you were doing it in reverse.
said that he'd like to bang about three out of five of them, but he'd rather they keep
the dick in their mouth so he doesn't have to hear them.
Zero!
Bum-bye!
Alright.
Rob Zink?
Uh, no.
Oh!
It's a Zink for him, not for me.
My vote is be glad it wasn't spice up your life, okay?
I know that whole song.
So I give it a two.
I know that whole song, and I love that whole song.
Up next, Loki, your first pick, because we're each putting in two songs tonight because
Jamie's not here, so we're going to have four songs to pick from.
Uh, Loki, what's your first song tonight that you're going to nominate to be banned from Orange Lounge forever?
This song is like the worst song ever. You guys seem to like it, so you know what? I hope it's gone.
Leave. It's done. This is lame.
I give you fucking Holic. Vote for Holic, you bitch! You fucking bitch and whiny, you can't vote for Holic. Vote for it now!
now all right so loki is putting in holic to be banned from the station forever because he's sick
of people trying to vote for it in the cage match so here we go song number two to be banned tonight
This is Tack with Holik.
Alright, that was song number two to be voted for eviction from Orange Lodge Radio tonight.
it was tack with holic and loki's trying to be cute because uh everybody always votes
for holic in our cage matches so he just wants that song off the station so people don't
try to vote for that shit anymore but you guys here's your say what do you think of
tack with holic it's tack it's holic it's hollering one to ten just for jamie i give
it ten all right angel it's tackified it has to stay ten all right no stalin
I'll give it a nice ten.
Alright.
Now I guess it's tag.
Can you guys see more?
Ten.
Alright.
One!
Cause it sucks.
It's the same damn song over and over again.
He thought he was all cool by his, you know, doing it in seven, four, you know, measures,
whatever.
Sucks.
Lame.
Lame song sounds like every single other song is done.
Alright.
I give it a nine because I just not going to give it a ten because I'm just that big
of a prank.
Song number three tonight is my pick and it's a Dance Mania pick.
This comes from Dance Mania EX1 and it's a cover song and it's a cover of a song that
was really famous because it was in a movie once and the name of the group that covers
it is called Bushida, and this is their cover of My Heart Will Go On. My pick for tonight
If you're done with the station, my heart will go on.
Enjoy!
In my, in my dreams, I see you, I feel you That's how I want to go on
Before I cross the distance, I'll stay deep between my
Ears come to shove you along
Wherever you are, I believe that the heart is gone
No, no, you are from the dark and you're here in my heart and my heart is gone and gone
I can touch you sometime, I'll just fall for our time
And I won't let you be with me, I won't let you be with me
It's covered of Blaine Dion. It needs to fucking DIE, BASTARD!
I hate Blaine Dion, so that gets a zero on my list.
Alright, Angel.
No, DIE, one.
No, Skylin.
I give it a zero. 0.1, I don't like this song at all.
Alright, Magus Zero. Goodbye.
Uh, Loki.
It gets a 10 because that movie was so sad.
Oh my god, he's so gone and she's so sad because her love died and became a popsicle.
I'm so alone!
I am the world's greatest singer.
And I give my song a ten because I have six crannies and you have none.
Because I have the words, great to see none.
Next thing you know, Celine Dion Hot Pockets.
Alright.
Loki, the final pick in tonight's reverse cage match.
For song to be banned from Orange Lounge forever.
What did you pick?
No, they saved my other song from being put in here because it probably would have gotten
put off but now you get to be subjected to it even more.
The song I was going to pick was Eddie Murphy's Party All the Time, but we like that song.
So instead, we've got Nancy and the Boys, a wonderful speed group who sucks because
it's speed music, doing Complicated.
So eat this.
Alright, from Speed 10, this is Nancy and the Boys with Complicated.
Enjoy.
I can't wait to see you again
I can't wait to see you again
Chill out, watch the young poor
Lay back, all the time you poor
And if you could only let it be
You'll see
I like you the way you are
When we're sliding in your car
And you're talking to me one-on-one
You've got somebody else
Everyone else
Watch them back, you can laugh
Try and fool, look like fool to me
Tell me
What you're gonna get
So complicated
I see the way you're acting
I'm somebody else, get me frustrated
I'm not just used to you
And you're all in your club
And you're great
And you take care
And you start hating too
No, no, no
You come over, I know
Check out, like yourself, I know
Where you are and where it's at, you see
You make me laugh out, rain looks like a pro
Take off all your crappy clothes
You know what I'm doing
And you want the music
Come on, come on now
Everyone else, watch them back
You can laugh, smile and cool
You look like a fool to me
Tell me what you know
This ain't something I can tell you
I hate it all when you're acting like nobody else
Get me frustrated
I trust this you
And you fall and you fall and you break
And you say what you get and you say it
Oh my God, I'm so glad we did this tonight.
The chat room reactions to these songs are fucking priceless.
This is great.
We've got to do this again.
Which classic lines is, she sounds like a meth addict?
How are you doing, Andrew?
Oh, would you say, Loki, play it again?
Oh, play it again. No.
All right, your thoughts, Nancy and the boys, complicated, speed 10.
What do you think, Pixie Dust?
I heard that when I was over at Garrett's house when he first got speed 10.
We just rolled on the floor laughing from that crap.
It's, unfortunately, better than Avril, but, you know.
Zero. Zero.
Alright, that's 7-1-10, she gives it a zero.
Angel, your thoughts on Nancy and the boys? Complicated.
Who the fuck either turned up or changed the speed on the record player to where it's like,
Who scratched my Avril Lavigne CD? I mean, mine? Um, maybe it was Bixby's.
Fuck you! I don't have Avril! I have fucking Nancy and the boys, get it right, bitch!
Mmmm, no.
Let's go one to ten, Angel.
Oh yeah, right.
One being low and ten being high.
One, bitch!
No Stalin, your thoughts on Nancy and the boys?
I give this song a 10 and I'm telling you why, I almost peed my pants laughing at the
chat room reactions during that song, and that is worth something.
Let's see, Rob, you almost peed your pants in Megas or you're supposed to die?
And I almost peed my pants on a dead Megas, so what?
That could be a fetish film.
Alright, here are your choices.
Remember tonight is a reverse cage match.
The song that wins, quote unquote, if we can call it that, will be banned from Orange Lounge
for all eternity.
Here we go.
Here's a recap.
You vote for the song you want to ban.
Here we go, Spice Girls with Wannabe, choice number one.
Song number two you can vote for tonight is kind of surprising, but it's Tack with Hollick.
All right, song number two you can vote for tonight is from Dance Mia X1.
It's a cover of Celine Dion with My Heart Will Go On.
Song number 4 you can vote for tonight from Speed 10 Nancy and the Boys with Complicated
Alright, there you go, please vote now, those votes come with a private message to me, Sky,
in the chatroom.
Alright, oh wow, I'm loving the reactions, they're like, no, don't do the recaps, don't
play them again, please, for the love of God, alright, we'll tally those votes momentarily.
No, you had an interesting opinion on Nancy and the Boys' Complicated.
I loved it.
It's beautiful.
Why did you love it and think it's beautiful?
Because it's funny.
It sounds like the Chipmunks.
Yeah, why do people buy Chipmunks albums?
This is what I want to know.
The Chipmunks, maybe were funny in the 50s, but they're not funny now.
Because they're only two bucks.
It's cheap entertainment like you, Rob.
Because all you have to do is slow down the song and it's the real song.
Nancy and the boys should die of chlamydia from what I understand.
A song can't die of chlamydia, AIDS maybe, but not chlamydia.
You know what?
We should send them to elephant bar and they can die of hepatitis.
Hey, if there's a tie tonight, you guys, we'll kick both songs off.
How's that sound?
There's a tie tonight. Guess what other song gets booted off? I think I see some votes
coming in for Holiks, so you never know. My Holiks could win, we'll see. And that Jamie
is going to be a pissed off woman if she hears the Holiks got banned from the station. She's
time magazine has named as game of the year for 2003 karaoke revolution. Why? Why? What
do you guys think? I'd like to hear Loki's thoughts on karaoke revolution having played
this? Do you think it's possibly because it's innovative and people like these innovative
games and they think it's going to start a revolution?
Isn't that innovative? Oh yeah, karaoke was just invented by Konami!
But what about the iToy? I think the iToy is way more innovative than karaoke revolution.
Yeah, but you can't sing with poorly recorded cover artists.
Hey, one of those poorly recorded cover artists is one of Angel's friends.
And a point.
Asshole!
God!
Two bucks.
Alright.
Not like me.
So, so Time magazine names karaoke revolution...
Max 2?
Never got named game of the anything.
Ultra Mix?
Won't get named game of the anything.
DER's just getting shit on left and right.
It may win MTV's poll.
Oh goodie.
What about Enter the Matrix? That was an awesome game.
I don't believe a rat about that one.
I guess it was better than the movies, right?
I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.
It was better than Karaoke Revolution.
Karaoke Revolution is kind of retarded.
All it is, is you're basically just taking your home console and singing with it.
Poorly. Singing poorly with it.
That is just me. And a lot of other people.
All you're doing is encouraging them.
God damn it.
If there's anything in this world we need, it's encouraging stupid people.
Why do we need to encourage them?
God damn it.
You won't let the stupid Chinese lady just stop asking you for samples.
No, you have to go and interject.
You have to go, oh yes, I will take a sample.
We keep the rats out of those.
I will ask them now.
And so, these won't stop.
It's the same with this God damn thing.
sometimes weren't meant to sing. Just the fact. Just don't sing. And this gives them
a false hope that someday they'll become a singing superstar. And in the meantime, they
have to torture us with their horrible renditions of crap. Including complicated. Lame. No.
Game of the year, I think not. But you seemed to have a good time when you played this game.
game? Oh yeah, great time was had by me, not. Okay. Alright, Pixie Dust. This game encourages
my Filipino relatives to go and buy an Xbox and play Karaoke Revolution. Actually, it's
on the PS2, dear. Oh, PS2. I thought it was on Xbox, for some reason. No, Xbox is Ultra
I bet you anything that Xbox will get a karaoke revolution, if it sells well on PS2.
It encourages my aunts to go, oh, that's karaoke, oh shit, ok, we'll go get that, and we'll
get some wine and beer and smoke glass and fight cocks all day long.
Yeah.
Filipino relatives.
They say, do you go bite cocks?
Fight them.
Oh, fight cocks.
Cock fighting.
What was this kind of blowjob revolution or something like that, you know?
Didn't we have a list list like that one week where we were deciding what needs a Bamani game?
And I want to say something...
Yeah, I want to say Beat Your Meat Mania won that, actually.
I think it did.
Anyway, who knows what revolution Konami will try to start next.
Okay, we're going to take another break here, and when we come back, we'll announce the winner of the cage match.
I have to take a break to tally the votes.
We have more votes tonight in tonight's cage match than I've ever seen in a cage match
ever, which makes me think we need to do a reverse cage match every week.
Just kidding.
Just kidding.
Don't kill me.
Don't kill me.
Yeah.
We'll end up having no songs on the station.
I'll just keep voting for Holly.
Also, are we going to get into this add-on crap later?
Absolutely.
When we come back, we're going to talk a little more about Ultramix, since it is coming out
this week after all.
In this break, just random potpourri stuff, couple songs from Guitar Freaks and something
from DDR that I rather like and I know some of you listening like it too.
So enjoy these good songs after that little orgy of bad stuff and we'll be right back.
Of course it's all relative, you could hate all three of these songs but, well, sucks
to be you.
We'll be back.
I get an eight-niner to scramble I got my car all set to scramble
Don't really know where I'm from so I put my foot down on the pedal
I got pedal to the metal Rolled down the highway just like a fireball
Climb like the stairs, don't stop the fire, boy, burn it high to the floor
Get those tomatoes, don't stop the fire, boy, burn the sky like it's snow
I'm gonna get it!
I'm going to get it!
It's great, man!
But when she caught his eye, ain't no man could fight those demons
He knew he'd have to try to let love in
Not to let him know, but to try again
But when she caught his eye, ain't no man could fight those demons
He knew he had to try to make love in
Not to let her know, she was in the mood for talking
So then he began to play the game
Before he knew it, he had told her how much he'd been hurting
How he was hoping she was not the same
Could you see the kind of way people are looking
After all that's trying to be true to love
And she said, boy, you don't have to love no more
I'll give the love you need till you holler in the fair and see
Like a love boy, I'm a fine lady
You've been hard, so peaceful, but I am the cure
When you wake up late, it's a dream
See, boy, you know she still haunts me, at least
This lady, you know what you found in me
As a lady, I'm the lady that can give you what you need
Baby, I'm a fine lady that will never leave you lonely
Yeah, but maybe this lady will find a baby from the other side, won't she?
Let's get together, honey, honey, me and you, and do the things, oh, do the things that
we like to do. Oh, do a little dance, make a little love. Get down to life, get down to life. Baby, babe, I need you. Same place, same town.
Well, we can't have all the kids together
And be so on my mind, oh
You and I, baby, look

Get down, get down, get down, get down, get down tonight, baby

Probably the Avril Lavigne cover.
Okay.

should go definitely complicated should have gone but all right I have a
feeling it's gonna be Holick all right we'll see
Maggie momentarily let me we'll kill you later what should go what do you think

to remove alt-hack music from this station? Jamie will stab you for that. If Jamie's listening,
she's going to come back and shove one of those ferrets right up your ass. Great. Alright,
but in all seriousness, what do you think will be voted tonight? Holic? Okay, well I
I already know who's losing.
And with 79% of the vote, the song you...
I'm sorry, what's going on over there?
They're raping the ferrets, bastards.
Don't play with the ferrets.
Jamie would be upset.
All right.
Yeah, don't play with the ferrets.
You're going to get beat up when Jamie comes back.
That's all.
And I'm the one who's going to be here,
because two of these bastards live in frickin' the Bay Area.
Bastards.
Alright.
What?
Repeat that.
Oh, it's the first or step.
Awesome.
There's the off-step.
Okay, Rob.
I'll quiet them down.
Alright, yeah.
Would you get those, would you get that, get them all uh, shutting up, please?
Alright, here we go.
Tonight's loser, with 79% of the votes, is Complicated.
It is gone from the station forever.
Hi, guys.
How's my little car screeching noise?
All right.
Okay, so complicated does get the boot from the station and you will never hear it on the station ever again
Even if somebody is trying to play speed 10 in their entirety
They must skip track one because you guys have voted complicated off of the station
Yeah, I can strip now
So in celebration pixie dust will be getting naked for you all right now. Oh, except the camps down tonight. What a bummer
Where's the music what music? Oh
Oh, I only had, my only stripping song was Complicated, so now I'm...
Rob, you got your... Rob, you got your show yesterday at Rekacon.
Wait, what? You got your show yesterday at Rekacon.
I got... You got my... Oh yeah, I did, I did get a show yesterday at Rekacon.
Arkadian is saying I should delete the file off my computer completely, and I
think that is a good idea, so...
Here we go, I'm going to, I'm currently going in, here's my DanceMania
Speed 10 directory. I'm going to Complicated,
I'm deleting it. It says do you want to send it through a cycle bin?
And I just like yes, and now I'm minimizing my dose so I can get to the recital bin and here we go
Wait for it. Wait for it. Oh
There went yeah sound that little paper wrecking sound that was it complicated is off my hard drive and gone forever
Gone forever
All right
I know that.
Loki, you had some stuff you wanted to share tonight with DDR Ultramix, since believe it
or not, we are a Bimani related show.
They've already announced what the first song pack is going to be.
It's a bunch of konami originals, starting with DJ Taka with Abyss from Fifth Mix, Naoki
Burning the Floor from Fourth Mix, Tomosuke with Mind Parasite from Dance Maniacs, Mr.
Alright, that is a little bit of money.
Love Will mixed up with it.
I should, if you want to grab your Fistoff soundtrack, go get it.
We'll hear it in my eyes in the next break. How's that?
We'll just save that for the next break.
What do you guys think of this whole...
We've kind of brought this up on the show before, but now that it's coming to light,
and the details are coming out, and the song list is coming out,
what do you guys think of this whole paying $5 to download songs bit?
What do you think of this? Good idea? Bad idea?
I could pay $5 to have sex with Rob. Bad idea.
Haha, you're not funny.
Sucky, sucky $5, me love you long time.
Okay.
I pay you $5 to get away.
What do you think of this idea? Does somebody have a serious comment here, Angel?
No. We already pay enough for Bemani. If you're like Bemani addicts, like we all are, we already pay enough for getting 2DX in our houses and being able to play that because you have to buy another system for that and all that crap.
Why even bother with Ultravix at all when you can just install Linux on an Xbox and
run StepMania?
Let's assume not everyone knows how to do that.
Not everyone's a nerdy genius like you, I guess.
I use that term extremely loosely.
Kind of like you.
Ha ha ha.
Just kidding.
Who's the loose one?
I'm just kidding.
I'm kidding.
I love you, Janae.
Pixie dust, don't get pouty with me.
I'm going to come show you some love, Pixie dust.
I'm going to show you some love.
I love you.
I'm going to put my head on your bosom.
Somebody get the cam.
I love you.
be? I love you too. I'm so in love. Barrett love. Barrett love. I could put an Xbox on
those tits, man. What? Yeah, it's good shopping. I love you. I love you too. Bastard.
I know you, of all people, love to pay to download things. I want to hear your thoughts
on the $5 for 5 songs bit. It's just $5. I'd just do it. If I had the Xbox version or whatever,
I might download it just so I can rip them. I don't see a problem with paying $5 for 5
songs. It's not that expensive for just a one-time purchase. It's just like an add-on
to buy the game or not. I probably will because we normally buy the game but then I rip the
songs and play them on my mind. I actually think I would buy the expansion
pack too but the problem is I don't own an Xbox and I still have higher things on my
priority list to get even with DDR coming out. I'm like, I need a new processor for
my computer so I can play Final Fantasy 11. I need a bigger hard drive for my MP3s. I
I need to buy a hooker. You bought me last night Rob. I'm sorry. You're from the 99 cent
hooker store. I can afford that. I'm sorry. She had to raise her prices due to inflation
in the breasts. Not like that mom and that baby huh Rob? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh come on
you're not going to tell them about that? Why don't you tell her? You tell her so much
No, I won't because now Loki is saying no, so never mind.
No, don't listen to Loki, I never do.
Well, we were coming out of the grocery store, going back to the car and this mom comes out with the kid in the cart and all of a sudden Loki responds with,
Oh look, they sold the kid or something and the kid was all happy and whatever. We all busted up laughing.
Alright, Loki wants to correct some things.
Go ahead, correct it because I don't...
I saw the stupid woman who looked homely with her stupid baby in her car, pushing her around
picking up cans or whatever, and then I'm like, aw, how cute, she's gonna go sell her
baby.
And the baby was all happy to be rid of her crack whore mom.
Alright.
Okay, um, wow.
What else is going on in the Beaumonti world?
what's going on in the Sim scene? Anything new in the Sim world? Why don't you give us
some of your Sim update of the week? DDR Maniacs, this site came up, yippee. And on ddramerica.com
or whatever, your BitTorrent site, you can find the wonderful Dancing Stage Fever songs,
which I played today, and they suck. Surprise, surprise. The end. That's it, nothing else
What's going on?
Nothing.
All right.
We're going to take a quick break, and when we come back, we're going to do the FUs of
the week.
So, send those on over to Private Message to Sky in the chat room, and we'll be reading
those right after this quick break.
And all three of these songs have something in common.
They may have a different artist's name, but they still have something very much in common.
We'll be back.
off with it in my eyes.
You make me free
They're the key of the need to live
You are the light that makes me free
They're not all the energy

Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
Alright, we're back, and it's about time to get in our favorite part of the show, the
FUs of the Week, but first we want to make a few quick programming announcements.
Vanilla Sky will not be on tomorrow night because I have to do some other errands and
with work getting busy and all, I can't stay up late so I have to take Angel home tomorrow.
Yeah.
Loki.
And unfortunately with my computer being the way it is in the situation I'm in, I'm unfortunately
unable to do a live wire show this week and that kind of sucks too but I didn't plan for
it to be this way and try and make sure it's not, but the computer is kind of up in the
air right now.
So instead, Vanilla Sky will be on Wednesday this week, so I'm going to move over to Wednesday
this week since there won't be a new live wire this week.
And tomorrow night, if we can get the computer hooked up tomorrow, I don't know, I'll play
an old episode of live wire in an increased bit rate.
So it'll be like a higher quality stream, so we'll do that tomorrow for Monday night.
If we can't get that to happen, we'll re-run an old episode of Vanilla Sky and a new episode
of Vanilla Sky on Wednesday this week.
Power Up at the Volume, of course, on Tuesday.
Re-run this week.
Jamie is still in Alabama.
She does get back on Tuesday, but we don't expect her to want to walk through the door
and sign online first thing.
She's probably going to want to sleep for a little while, so she'll be back next week
though.
She'll be back Sunday for sure.
Season 4 of Orange Lawn's radio debuts this Sunday, and the catch was that we were going
to go MP3 Pro on Sunday, but we'll get into that in the FUs of the week. Which it is now
time for you guys. Here we go, we are going into the FUs of the week. I have to get a
little bit old school this week with the FU music because of Loki's computer being down.
I'm missing a few files, but we'll start it off.
Jamie this week would like to give a big F.U. to stupid people and us, I don't know, stupid
drivers and things that are pissing her off in Alabama, and I'm sure she misses all of
us greatly. So that's Jamie's F-use for tonight, which I am entering on her behalf. Up next
is Loki with his F-use. And he still has the Christmas speed music, I promise, two weeks
I wish you would have thought of this when we did the cage match, huh?
Wait an hour, wait in line for another hour, get a new processor and drive back.
And then finally I tried my computer and my computer worked.
My old computer, something happened in the motherboard when I was installing it, so that didn't work.
So I go back to Fry's and go pick up a new motherboard and come back home.
And yeah, I wasted four hours because of Fry's.
So Fry's sucks.
Then there was this guy today when I was driving on the road who was trying to scratch his
ass or something while driving his beat up truck and was like swerving all over the road.
Like practically like you know just driving in two lanes at once and stuff like that.
So I hate people and they deserve to die.
And um another thing was um fucking with people with cell phones because uh your cell phones
are going to get taken away pretty soon and you're not going to be able to drive in your
car with your cell phones.
So guess what?
You're gonna have to concentrate on the road now, huh?
No!
Two words, one word, compound, headset.
So, I just, you know, I hate it, I hate you guys, you know, driving at cell phones, you suck.
Too small!
I also hate the old bitch that was driving in front of me that was driving like 35 miles an hour in a 50 mile an hour road.
Uh, you suck and I yelled at you, so, yeah.
Um, also, fuck you to 107.9, cause they really suck.
I don't understand why you have to send interns to a stupid competition like that.
They have no opinion whatsoever.
All they were doing was promoting some god knows whatever concert and I forgot what it was.
Good job on them.
Hey, let's do the look.
Good show sucks ass.
So anyway, so they suck ass and the fact that they have 107.9 coming to promote their damn show, that's really sad.
Then not only that, that civic guy had no, you know, comments whatsoever, no constructive comments about these people in the first place, so that sucks.
Ooh. Ooh, cat fight.
I have to figure that one out.
What the hell is this? This is like some Australian guy singing this.
Oh, crikey! It's Rudolph! He's going down in history!
Oh, that's awful!
I had lots of money this weekend and now it's all gone, more or less.
I think I'm done for now.
All right, my turn.
Of course, we get to hear Lion Suki again, even though we played it in that break, which,
by the way, was all a Kiriyama, but related things.
Rick in my eyes, Dancer, Duvall, Lion Suki, all 2DX songs, too.
My F.U. this week goes to live365.com, the lovely site that hosts our radio station.
That MP3 Pro live shit was supposed to be rolled out at the end of October, and we're
still waiting for it.
I was hoping we could have a live MP3 Pro stream starting Sunday, but that ain't gonna happen. Why? Because Live365 can't fucking get things out on time.
I hope we don't get the plug pulled for ranting on this on Live365, but hey, I'm entitled to my right of speech.
I'm just a little upset. I'm also upset at them because they're promoting the MP3 Pro thing all over the site when it's supposed to be in beta still.
It's not supposed to be something that was rolled out to everybody, and I think it's a piss-poor thing to do to roll it out when half the people can't use it, because the live software isn't rolled out yet.
You guys suck that cock, cock and balls, and I hope you get your shit done soon before I come to wherever you're at and set your building on fire.
He said come.
Yeah, I said come.
Um, let's see, my other FUs of the week go to, um, being single, because being single sucks, and, um, my other FU goes to my job, because as much as I love my job, having to teach two classes at once is going to suck a fat cock, and, oh, I'm going to hug from Janae.
Aw.
I would hate to do Janae if they're having a vagina, not a penis.
F.U. goes to loading friends money cause they never pay you back, well ex-friends, never pay you back cause they're bastards.
Or this person is a bastard.
And yeah, that's one thing.
F.U. goes to the search for Miss Applebottom cause it fucking sucks.
Why the fuck are you going to tell Nelly that you can make your twat clap?
What kind of thing does it have to do?
What does it have to do with your butt?
What does that sound like?
Let me try, hold on.
All I gotta say, that'd be cool if I could do it in time with like the Addams Family song.
No, no, no. Crap, crap.
Um, hi one more fuck you.
Fuck you to Loki.
I'm going to a fucking good Charlotte concert, you bastard.
And I'm glad about it.
Yo, hang out with your 107.9 cronies!
You're gonna be 106.5 cronies, bitch!
Oh my god! Like, there's a difference.
There is a difference.
They don't play Eminem on 107.9.
Take your hand for it.
Fucktard!
I don't know. Angel just said fucktard in my ear.
Whoa, wait!
I blame you on it.
But, I would fuck you, Ghost Nelly, for smacking on my ass.
And, well, no wait.
I'm not supposed to but I liked it yeah and yeah fuck having big tits cuz I'm
actually in studio and I can say that with Loki's face change like shut the
fuck up fuck having big tits just don't think you're right I'm sorry those aren't
big tits big tits like double G that's like the stuff that you see on
Yeah, shut the fuck up.
They can hold an Xbox between them, shut up.
Hey, that is so fake.
An Xbox can hold a small country in it, okay?
I did not really mean you could put an Xbox on those boobs.
Controller, maybe. Xbox, no.
Fuck, did I get you to put an Xbox in my car?
I'm done.
I usually have this huge, long F.U. for Sky, but now I don't have an F.U. except for those
rocks in Sacramento.
Fuck you, rocks.
Rock on.
All right, Angel, your F.U. is for tonight, Angel.
Stop laughing and rain about something.
This is not a funny part of the show, you are not allowed to laugh.
I see.
Pc Dust is balancing DNL on her boobs, that's why they're stopping right now.
But can you crush the can?
Angel.
Um, thank you to my work for not being able to give us checks on Friday,
but you know, it's a mail thing so...
I'm not that angsty this week, surprisingly enough.
up?
uh oh, uh oh, here comes lucky again
fuck you to the stupid god damn commercials on the radio about some truck
i don't give a fuck if a black hole does not have a hemi
okay
I swear to God, if I was that person in this fictitious commercial, I would have gutted
those two people talking.
I hated that commercial because it's so fucking annoying.
Hey, I got a Hemi too!
Look what I can do!
How much is that purple tail?
Does it have a Hemi?
I'm a redneck!
Who fucks my own cousin?
I hate that fucking commercial.
That's all.
I'm dead.
Magus.
I hate that fucking commercial.
That's all.
I'm dead.
Magus.
Alright, this is gonna keep me for most of the day.
F you to the way that the swap room at Rekacon was designed, the way they had the door guards
and shit.
There was one way in, one way out.
could not you know go out for like five seconds and go back in the same door
and go all the way around the building and go back in it's just a pain in the
ass and then they had the long lines at the game room then let's see if you do
traffic good at getting into Pittsburgh for Rekha Khan and F you to fog on the
All right, sorry. Captain Canada, I'd like to give a nephew to the week. Beer bottle caps
for being so impossible to open without a bottle opener. And my roommate and myself
for not having bottle opener in our dorm. It took me like 10 minutes and a cut hand
before I finally ripped the cap off with a pair of scissors. It was like sitting on the
pot and then realizing there's no toilet paper.
Wipe your ass with a shower curtain.
Zodiac Knight would like to send a big F.U. to his school, the Illinois Institute of Technology
for being such money-grubbing whores who continue to not provide for their students.
And if you can't say the school's name on the air, I'll understand.
Oops.
Hi, ZodiacNet, by the way.
Um, let's see.
Evil Naoki 2DX would like to say, fuck Seton Medical Center for not telling us that my grandmother suffers from anemia.
Thanks to those asshats, my grandmother is on life support and I have no fucking idea if she's going to live to see tomorrow.
Piper Girl would like to say, F you to programming, the C language, pointers and arrays.
Fuck you to my fan club, who seem to show up at the arcade every time I show up and
look like they're watching more than just me playing Initial D.
They're watching your press, of course.
F you to stalkers in general, because they're giving ex-C9, C9, M me creepy looks in terms
of smiling and trying to be friendly when it's creepy as fuck.
And F you to midterms, because of those I haven't been able to go to Orange Lawn's radio.
And I miss the Orange Lawn's radio crew, so yeah.
SVI is tuning in from Las Vegas tonight and would like to give an F-You of the week to
the manager of the virtual reality zone of the Adventure Dome at Circus Circus in Las
Vegas.
That was one of the first places I ever played VR.
They don't fix their bimani machines so many locals accuse the workers of being lazy ass
bastards when it's actually the manager who is to be blamed for it.
F-You to myself for being left out of too much.
I want to get out of Las Vegas so I can be back with my friends back at the RTA crew.
Fred Phelps, I think, and he's a total ass-hat who's just an attention-horn, that's how he does it by fag-bashing, so that's why we don't like to acknowledge that he exists, because sick people like that don't exist in my world.
Be sure to tune in to his show, The 700 Club, on the Family Channel.
Yeah, weekdays at 11.
700 Club, great material for having friends over and wanting to talk about something.
If you like this video, please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel.

Alright
Magus got a score of 8,936
We've been officially saved
Why?
Because he's done.
He's done?
Oh, okay.
Not even a gold record.
I've got a place, so I have a reason.
Basically, since we're kind of...
This isn't a popular segment with our chat room.
I think I got the equivalent of a C.
I don't know.
My voice isn't too good today, so...
We'll let one more person go, and then we'll judge where we're at.
So, Janae, why don't you pixie dust, why don't you take over.
And if the chat room says, please Lord, pull the plug, after Janae, we'll stop this segment.
Otherwise, we're putting Loki on stage.
She's going to do a little bit of sexy piano loving here from a Pixie Dust.
Alright, ready? Here she goes. Remember you want to kind of keep the green arrow on the blue bar.
That's right. You're going to be singing at Central Station.
Alright, here we go. Loading. This is Pixie Dust with Don't Know Why.
and chat room you can vote if you want this segment to keep going with Loki singing a
song or if you want us to end it.
I'll wait till I've saw the sun I don't know why I love you by the house of
I don't know why I didn't come I don't know why I didn't come
When I saw the break of day I wish that I would fly away
Can't change till you've got me in my hands My heart is dreshed in your eyes
And you'll be on my mind For all I know
I'll be on my mind for a little while
I'll cross the endless sea
I will die in that sea
But I'll be right here
I'm running down the road
My heart is drenching
Can I get that one?
You'll be on my mind forever
I don't know why I don't know why I don't know why
I didn't come
Feeling empty as a drum
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come
I don't know why I didn't come
All right, a score of 31,043 points for Pixie Dust. Nice job. And also a platinum. She is
a superstar. I let you guys vote in the chat room if you wanted to keep this statement
going because some of you guys were complaining about it. And you voted, Loki has to sing.
You guys wanted to hear it, so Loki will be singing complicated.
In the meantime, vote in the chat room.
Do you want no stylin' to sing?
No stylin' me?
Loki, sing the parody.
Sing the word out.
No stylin' will be up after Loki.
I don't want to sing.
I suck.
You'll see why.
I should have just done my live performance as the song that we should have voted off.
What the hell is happening to this microphone, too?
It's like all fucked up.
God damn it, I don't wanna play a song!
Hey, who told the chat room to vote?
Oh, we just cycled out of a game.
Teninga is the winner.
Teninga is the winner!
Alright, here we go.
Going back into a new game.
And we're gonna play Teninga again.
Alright, here we go.
Loki will be singing Complicated.
And, Loki will be singing at the pit stop, as will the song sound like a pit stop.
I don't want to do this!
Dude, I am like a chick on this stage. She is so lame.
Okay, just so you know chat room, I can't sing. And they're doing this because they hate you. They don't like you.
I'm feeling sweet
Chill out, which is all I'm looking for
Lay back, it's all been done before
And if you could go on leave, let it be
You will see
I like you, you are

You suck.
Bite my ass.
Chill out, watch it goin' for.
Lay back, it's all been done before.
Eat my ass, you could only let it be.
You'll see.
I think this segment is really dead. You should stop torturing the chat room now
You're really trying to be cool looking like a fool to me. I could have told you that
Tell me
You know, they're fucking recording this god damn you
I hate it. I want her to break down cry again
You'll fail, and you'll crawl, and you'll break, and you'll take, and you'll get, and you'll turn it, blah blah blah blah
Crowd boost, so fucking take that up your ass
No, no, why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're looking and acting like somebody else gets me frustrated
Life's like this and that's it, she's failing, she's failing
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
I want to sing to promise me
I'll never forget
You
Fucking
Suck
Oooh
Alright
A score of
5824 points
For Loki
Believe it or not, not even a gold record
Alright
You guys voted
If no stylin' should sing or not
You voted that yes, No Styling needs to get up there to sing.
So, No Styling, what song are you going to do?
We don't know what he's going to sing because he hasn't chosen and he doesn't know these songs.
So yeah.
What are you going to pick for him?
You'll laugh, you'll cry. It's a feel good song of the year. I'm coming out. Hit me with
Give me with your best shot.
Yes, yes.
Give me with your best shot.
Give me with your best shot.
No, that's killer.
That's all one go.

Oh, you are the wind beneath my wings.
Fly, fly, fly.
Fly, fly away.
Fly, fly, fly away.
Fly, fly, fly away.
Fly, fly, fly away.
Wow!
No Stylin has failed his song with 2,146 points.
No Stylin failed Wind Beneath My Wings and Tenenga has broken down on stage and cried.
Alright, here you go you guys, this is how it's going to work, you guys are going to
vote for a winner.
The winner will come back and sing an encore song which will be selected at random by the
game unless, unless it's a song that we've already done, then we'll back out and pick
a different one, okay?
So here we go, just put it in the chat room, all in caps, who you want the winner to be.
You can vote for me, I sang Like A Virgin, you can vote for Magus who sang Power Of Love,
You can vote for a pixie dust who sang, what the hell did you sing, I forgot already.
You sang Don't Know Why, you sang the Noah Jones one.
And you can vote for Loki who sang Complicated at your request, or you can vote for No Stylin
who sang Wind Beneath My Wings.
So put all in caps right now who you want to sing again and who will play a random song.
We see some Rob, some No Stylin, we'll see.
There's going to be a tie between Loki and no stylin.
This is what it's going to be.
I predict it.
Minus Cleoparison.
Alright, you guys have a minute to flood our screen with your votes.
I won't fix you.
Sorry about that.
I guess people who don't like flooding, but my inbox is already full of your Ask Orange
Lounge questions, which we probably won't get to now.
I love Angel, she voted for me.
Okay, we see some Janaes.
Oh, I'm starting to see some Lokis.
Oh no, there's four lines for Loki. Victor, no styling. Um, let's see. Loki wins. Loki,
um, I don't know. It's kind of close. You guys, it's between me, Loki and no styling.
What do you think? What do you guys think? You guys didn't vote for me. You kind of thinking
I'm thinking, you did get a vote Janae, I did get one too.
I did, me.
You know what?
I'm thinking Loki is the winner.
Loki is going to do an encore presentation right now.
Loki is the winner.
Red wine.
No, I know.
Yes, yes!
No, no.
It's going to be randomly selected by the computer.
randomly selected by the computer. If it's a song we've already heard, we're going to cancel it out and do a different one because we want to hear something new.
Alright, ready Loki?
Alright.
This is no scoring mode, it's just playing karaoke fun. Actually, no wait, no, I'm sorry.
No wait, I don't remember how to get it to select random now.
Okay, you ready Loki? We're going to pick one completely at random. Here is the song Loki will be singing as his encore.
for. The wheel is spinning and it's landing on. It's the end of the world as we know it.
Alright, here we go. Loki singing is the end of the world as we know it at the county fair.
Enjoy.
Let's sing along. Yeah, group sing along.
I am so not singing this song, I'm just gonna...
That starts with an earthquake, birds and snakes and airplanes.
Lady Bruce is not afraid.
I am not afraid of words.
I don't like this song. I can't work with this.
Uh...uh...
I can't hit the pitch.
World has deck.
Dude, they're too fast. Give me a different song. Come on, seriously.
This is ridiculous. I can't remember this.
That means we are going to pick the song for him.
Right?
I can't work this. This is too fast.
What do you guys say, believe, like a girl, just want to have a, alright, I'm coming out,
I'm coming out, here it is, Loki singing I'm coming out, at the county fair, with Teninga,

spreading the love there's more for me to fear and I just feel so good every
time I hear I'm singing I'm happy with the females gotta let it show I'm

And it just keeps on going on.
I'm going to kill anyone in the chat room that has a recording of this. You're going to so die. I know where you live.
As a reminder, the show will be broadcast this week on Thursday.
A score of 6,964 points for Loki. Not even a gold record. There is no justice in this world. Okay.
Alright, we're gonna shut the game off now. Oh my god. I have not laughed that hard
My head I laugh so hard. I peed okay. I put a little I peed a little bit I
Can't lose my job anymore, so no sex tonight, huh?
out. Oh, that hurt so bad. Oh my God. I can't believe you. Okay. I should have been like,
I'm sliding in. You know, that would have been even better. But, alright. Whew, alright.
Luckily, the one person that Loki forgets has a recording is me.
Woo!
Alright.
My head hurts so bad.
Since we probably, we might run a little bit over tonight, but I don't think anybody cares
after that.
And to think, you guys wanted to end the segment before Loki sang.
I don't want to sing anymore.
I think we should make him sing again.
Oh, come on.
We have to...
It should be...
Okay, I got it.
It's going to have to be a bit.
It's the only reason people are going to tune into our show now.
It should be a duo between Victor and Loki.
You know what? When the Karaoke Revolution expansion pack comes out, Loki will sing again.
So, you're my fucking monkey, Loki will sing when I tell you to.
Dance, monkey dance.
What we're going to do when the expansion pack comes out, we'll do this again.
This is more incentive for Konami to get those expansion packs out.
As promised...
Oh my God, let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
I have no idea how we're gonna follow that segment,
but we'll sure try.
Will Pixie Dust take her top off?
Will Magus take his pants off?
I hope not, that would be a sign that make me blind.
Here we go, first question tonight, and ask Orange Lounge.
No!
What happened?
Oh my God, I guess I missed it. Here we go. First question. First question from... I can't
find... Okay, here we go. Leadfoot would like to know, how did MobaMoga get into Extreme
and which one of you made it? Good, thank God. MobaMoga's by The Orange Lounge and it
got into Extreme because Konami got cheap and stopped licensing things. One more time,
says, Whew! I saw her do this! All right, Ledford would also like to know, what happened
to Orange Crush? That was kind of a regular segment we had on the show. Well, that's Rice
Princess's thing, and since she's not really on the show much anymore, because she spends
a lot of time coming over for Vanilla Sky. But of course, Rice Princess always welcome
at the show, and if she comes back, I'm hoping she'll bring some Orange Crush with her. A
good substitute would always be Vanilla Sky video game trivia, which you can hear on Vanilla
Sky, which is the bad music and video game trivia. Alright, so let's see. XBI would like
to know, what songs do you guys look forward to playing on Guitar Freak 10th or Drummania
9th Mix? None of them. None of them. It's the same fucking game over and over. Maybe
the Weezer song, One Time, for shits and giggles. I think that would be about it. I think they
play Mad Blast, but that wasn't on this one. No, I don't think it was. Alright. John Fields
would like to know, Loki, which Beatmania SIM do you prefer, and why do you prefer it
over the other, BM98 or Beatmania DX? I don't play Beatmania SIMs, but I play the emulators,
so that was kind of cool. But I was using a, what was it, Beatmania DX, whatever it
is. There's actually another one, too, that not many people know of. I can't remember
what exactly the name of it was, because I had the link on my old computer. But there's
There's another sim out there that's comparable to B-Mania DX.
Question from Jay Kinetic, Astro Glide or KY?
Pixie Dust says Astro Glide.
Nelly says KY.
Warming liquid says Nelly.
I say choice number three, ID, which most of you have probably never heard of.
Janae knows of it.
Anybody else care to answer this question?
No, all right then, moving on.
Darktits, oh, now's the vote for Loki's song.
SGhost would like to know, what package are you guys using
for Live 365?
I'm trying to start up a station,
and you seem to have a good thing going.
PS, I won't be playing anything on Sunday night, so you know.
Without getting into too many specifics,
I can talk about this more with you offline,
but we have the personal broadcaster package.
We don't run as a commercial station,
because we don't run our own in-house ads
or anything like that.
And we don't really have that many people
that listen that necessitate us needing hundreds
of simultaneous listeners.
So we have one of the personal packages.
I can give you the specifics offline.
He says he wants to do his own station.
Hey, sure, why not?
The more the merrier.
But you start a live talk show, I'll kill you.
No, I'm just kidding.
I'm kidding.
Because they were voting for the song
they wanted you to sing, Loki.
That's why I have all the PMs.
It's one of the personal broadcaster packages,
And it's reasonable, I guess, although I don't like the idea of having to pay to do this
show.
But whatever.
We had fun doing it and that's what it's all about.
EvilMalkey2Dx would like to know, when are you coming over to clean my house and the
plumbing?
Anytime in the place, baby.
That's it.
I'm out of questions unless somebody else wants to send along a new question.
Actually we probably should start to get wrapping up the show pretty soon here.
I'm having a lot of people ask me for a copy of the karaoke revolution segment.
What do you guys think we ought to do with that?
I'm thinking burn it, sell it on Ebay, the highest bidder, Kazaa, put it on Kazaa, we'll
see what happens.
I think it could be a good promotion show.
Loki and I have been busting our butts trying to get a new website done and when we have
that new website done in our downloads area we will put that up just for you guys.
You know what? We should get ourselves a listeners club. An Orange Lounge listeners club. Yeah.
Well, we have a message board, but none of us seem to use it, but it is over at calliebomani.com.
If you click on the evil board of randomness. Unfortunately, our phones have been a little
dead lately, but you can go there and revive them. We certainly wouldn't mind. I'm making
a sexy pose for pixie dust right now. I was just showing off my pillowy lips. Alright,
I guess we're going to close the mailbag now for Ask Orange Lounge. That was Orange Lounge
or should I say Ask Orange Lounge. The segment's over now so don't send any more questions.
We hope you learned something really useful.
The show's over, so we're going to end the segment right now.
All right.
Now's the part of the show where we go around and we get everybody's final thoughts.
Let's start with No Stalin.
Thank you for coming tonight.
No Stalin, no is your first show.
Kind of an interesting show to have as your first show.
I really like the show, you know.
Good.
them and me showing up. It's cool. Good times. Good times. Good times. G.T. like to say.
Yes. Your mom. Thank you. Who thought that over? Pixie Dust, your final thought. I'm
laying on the twenty-third or sixty-nine magnus in O's Island right now. I am such a slut,
but only one comes home with me tonight well that's Rob yes that's me I get to
come home I'm getting a restraining order shut up you fuck face all right
um let's see moving on um Magus your final thought for tonight why'd you have
to go ahead make things so complicated your final thought for tonight I didn't
think of one, damn you. I'm coming out. Oh my god, there's a milkshake! Milkshake! Cheeseburger!
Loki, your final thought. I want to sing it to you. Here it comes. Loki's gonna sing his
final thought tonight. Uh, no I'm not. Alright. I'm not gonna sing my final thought. Ah, I...
The hell is this wrapped around?
What the fuck?
Anyways...
Lisa's on my chair this time.
Um...
Please don't make me sing anywhere.
I don't...
We have an afterbirth coming up.
I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.
Fine! If they want to be tortured like that,
their masochist in the goddamn chat room, fine.
Alright.
We'll see.
Alright, uh, is that your final thought?
My final thought is, wow, I almost peed when Loki sang. That was amazing. Loki has driven
me to urinary movements in my body. That is amazing.
The final word of tonight, thank you guys for being here next week on the show, season
four premiere. Jamie's back in his house and will tell us all about our Alabama trip. DDR
Ultra Mix is out on the shelves and we'll be giving our impressions if we get a chance
to play it, actually, and more craziness. Tonight's final word I will give to Pixie
Dust. It's the final word, the one word to sum up the entire show and leave us on.
Twat. Clap. You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sakura, Sky and Loki. We expect you a nice play again.
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
What I really like about the movies, I like the previews for some reason.
I like to get there.
I don't want to see just the movie when I get there.
I got to see some previews first.

One desire.
They went too far.
They broke all the rules.
One man, Kermit the Frog as a pimp.
Where's my money?
Where is it?
One man, one way.
What a weird voice, Satan.
That's the only thing that guy could do for a living, you know?
He couldn't be a mechanic or anything.
Hey, uh, how much is that transmission gonna cost me?
An arm and a leg.
Just imagine having sex with somebody, that'd be hilarious, you know?
Oh yeah, the desire in your eyes.
The passion between us burns with fire.
Oh yeah, one way in, no way out.
Oh, same babble.
Jean-Claude Van Damme in the same crap
