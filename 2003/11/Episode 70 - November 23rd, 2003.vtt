01:00.000 --> 01:25.320
And now for our feature presentation.

01:25.320 --> 01:29.620
Orange Lounge Radio Live is now on the air.

01:29.620 --> 01:37.220
Orange Lounge Radio Live is a live talk program dedicated to all things Bomani and Bensum.

01:37.220 --> 01:42.620
Orange Lounge Radio may contain adult content, but you probably shouldn't let your children

01:42.620 --> 01:43.620
listen.

01:43.620 --> 01:50.940
If you do let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio, they may turn into evil little

01:50.940 --> 01:53.060
demons from hell!

01:53.060 --> 01:58.380
Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.

01:58.380 --> 02:07.140
Now you see that evil will always triumph, because good is dumb.

02:07.140 --> 02:10.180
Fact, drunk and stupid is no way to go flex up.

02:10.180 --> 02:13.820
He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body.

02:13.820 --> 02:18.580
Well, it makes you look like an ass is what he does, Ed.

02:18.580 --> 02:19.580
Hamburgers!

02:19.580 --> 02:21.620
The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.

02:21.620 --> 02:22.620
I was a huge...

02:22.620 --> 02:23.620
Cool.

02:23.620 --> 02:24.620
Cool.

02:24.620 --> 02:28.620
Do you mind if I take my new car for a ride?

02:28.620 --> 02:30.620
That's right.

02:30.620 --> 02:32.620
The only thing you're gonna be riding is me.

02:32.620 --> 02:33.620
Have you seen my picture?

02:33.620 --> 02:34.620
Lena?

02:34.620 --> 02:38.620
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my underground lair.

02:38.620 --> 02:40.620
So it was you.

02:40.620 --> 02:41.620
I was going to expose you.

02:41.620 --> 02:42.620
I know.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.620
So I choose to expose myself.

02:44.620 --> 02:45.620
Please, there are ladies present.

02:45.620 --> 02:48.620
This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.

02:48.620 --> 02:49.620
Dark Sakura.

02:49.620 --> 02:52.620
Oh my god, I see a bloody stump!

02:52.620 --> 03:04.300
Skye, Loki, Orange Lounge Radio

03:04.300 --> 03:11.940
We are live and this is episode number 70 for November the 23rd of 2003 you're tuned

03:11.940 --> 03:18.060
in to the Bamani Scene's most underprepared radio station of all things being money.

03:18.060 --> 03:19.940
My name is Rob Roberts if you might know me as Skye.

03:19.940 --> 03:27.780
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, back from her two-week vacation,

03:27.780 --> 03:31.140
the happiest bunny on the farm, Ms. Jamie Summers.

03:31.140 --> 03:32.140
You know her better?

03:32.140 --> 03:33.140
Hi!

03:33.140 --> 03:34.140
Long time no talk.

03:34.140 --> 03:35.140
I'm cooking.

03:35.140 --> 03:36.140
Bye.

03:36.140 --> 03:37.140
Tonight, she's Iron Chef Sakura right now.

03:37.140 --> 03:40.860
In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

03:40.860 --> 03:41.860
Hello.

03:41.860 --> 03:42.860
I need to un...

03:42.860 --> 03:43.860
What the hell?

03:43.860 --> 03:48.820
The cords have just all mated with each other.

03:48.820 --> 03:51.540
loki picked up a microphone and it's like taking the christmas lights out of

03:51.540 --> 03:53.500
the box on christmas

03:53.500 --> 03:56.580
what the hell is this doing here? there's like a ribbing cable

03:56.580 --> 03:58.900
this random printer cord is mixed in too

03:58.900 --> 04:00.060
uh... anyway

04:00.060 --> 04:03.020
if we sound a little disorganized tonight it's because we are

04:03.020 --> 04:04.980
we have jamie over here cooking

04:04.980 --> 04:06.300
we have uh...

04:06.300 --> 04:09.060
loki over here you know trying to untangle the cords me i've been feeling

04:09.060 --> 04:11.500
kinda uh... this evening i'll get into that later

04:11.500 --> 04:12.820
so i'm just like

04:12.820 --> 04:17.600

04:26.200 --> 04:28.000
hi how you doing

04:28.000 --> 04:32.720
i was here like two weeks ago how could it be that long? long enough

04:32.720 --> 04:35.080
what did you bring with you tonight?

04:35.080 --> 04:36.280
it's a surprise

04:36.280 --> 04:39.480
if you really want me to tell them first break

04:39.480 --> 04:43.600
who else did you bring with you here? let's have her introduce herself

04:43.600 --> 04:48.600
Most people who are listening should know her if they go to RVGL, or actually did go to RVGL.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.600
Yeah, but we're a worldwide show, so...

04:54.600 --> 04:55.600
Yeah, that's right.

04:55.600 --> 04:56.600
Well, there she is.

04:56.600 --> 04:57.600
Miko.

04:58.600 --> 04:59.600
Hi.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.600
How are you?

05:01.600 --> 05:03.600
I'm fine. How are you?

05:03.600 --> 05:06.600
I'm good. Welcome to our disorganized mess of a show.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.600
Well, this is fun.

05:09.600 --> 05:13.600
Alright, well, hey, the fun's just about to start.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.600
We haven't even gotten there yet.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.600
Alright, we're going to take a quick break to try and organize ourselves,

05:18.600 --> 05:22.600
and we'll get that surprise ready, and we'll start off the show with it

05:22.600 --> 05:24.600
as soon as we come back.

05:24.600 --> 05:29.600
After a little bit of this and a little bit of that from the Bomani world.

05:29.600 --> 05:36.600
back.

05:59.600 --> 06:17.640
You leave me when I'm at the woods Feelin' as if I've been cursed

06:17.640 --> 06:23.640
As if I've been cursed with a cold within

06:25.640 --> 06:30.640
Days goodbye and still I think of you

06:32.640 --> 06:38.640
Days when I couldn't live my life without you

06:38.640 --> 06:42.640
Without you

06:42.640 --> 07:10.640
I know that you understand me I know that you understand me

07:10.640 --> 07:14.640
I know that you're lost to me, I know you're lost on my lips

07:14.640 --> 07:18.640
You're so peculiarly derided, I know that you're the lady

07:18.640 --> 07:22.640
I know that you're lost to me, I know you're lost on my lips

07:22.640 --> 07:26.640
Maybe you could tell

07:26.640 --> 07:31.640
Sometimes I'm sick and fussy, see through my speech on me

07:31.640 --> 07:35.640
Maybe I'll be fly but I can't trust that you're nothing

07:35.640 --> 07:37.640
I know that you just hear me

07:37.640 --> 07:39.640
I know you just want me

07:39.640 --> 07:41.640
Yes, I need you

08:01.640 --> 08:04.640
Maybe I feel guilty

08:04.640 --> 08:09.640
Maybe I should be taking my pain

08:09.640 --> 08:13.640
Maybe I should be taking my pain

08:13.640 --> 08:18.640
Maybe she should be taking my pain

08:21.640 --> 08:24.640
I can't change the time

08:24.640 --> 08:26.640
I'm so mad

08:26.640 --> 08:29.640
I really like it

08:29.640 --> 08:31.640
I really like

08:31.640 --> 08:33.640
I can't find the

08:33.640 --> 08:35.640
I'm the only one

08:35.640 --> 08:37.640
I'm the only one

08:37.640 --> 08:39.640
Yeah

08:39.640 --> 08:41.640
Yeah

08:41.640 --> 08:43.640
Yeah

08:43.640 --> 08:45.640
Yeah

08:45.640 --> 08:47.640
Yeah

08:47.640 --> 08:49.640
Yeah

08:49.640 --> 08:51.640
Yeah

08:51.640 --> 08:53.640
Yeah

08:53.640 --> 08:55.640
Maybe I

08:55.640 --> 08:57.640
Will be taking my

08:57.640 --> 08:59.640
you

10:27.640 --> 10:44.080
Hey, did you hear about that show?

10:44.080 --> 10:45.080
What show?

10:45.080 --> 10:48.200
Well, they play a lot of grace and money and video of each game music, but if you listen

10:48.200 --> 10:50.320
to it, you have to listen to it again within seven days.

10:50.320 --> 10:52.120
Oh, I've heard of that station.

10:52.120 --> 10:53.120
Really?

10:53.120 --> 10:55.280
Yeah, I even listened to it a couple weeks ago.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.780
Hey, what happens to you if you don't listen to it again?

10:57.780 --> 10:59.280
Well, you die.

10:59.280 --> 11:00.780
I what?

11:00.780 --> 11:02.080
Hey! Wait!

11:02.080 --> 11:05.080
What's this crazy bitch doing coming out of my computer screen?

11:05.080 --> 11:06.280
Aaaaaah.

11:06.880 --> 11:08.280
Orange Lounge Radio.

11:08.280 --> 11:10.280
Listen or die!

11:11.280 --> 11:12.280
Seven days.

11:13.280 --> 11:16.280
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

11:16.280 --> 11:17.780
Episode number seventy.

11:17.780 --> 11:18.780
Yo.

11:18.780 --> 11:22.780
If you wanna join our chat room, head on over to www.calibomani.com.

11:22.780 --> 11:24.280
Click on Orange Lounge and click on Chat.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.280
And he tells me it's good, and I believe my friends usually.

11:56.280 --> 11:57.280
Do you believe everything everyone tells you?

11:57.280 --> 11:58.280
Yes.

11:58.280 --> 12:04.280
You know, Rob, I have some, uh, swampland I could sell you in Arizona.

12:04.280 --> 12:05.280
What?

12:05.280 --> 12:06.280
You have one?

12:06.280 --> 12:08.280
I have some swampland I could sell you in Arizona.

12:08.280 --> 12:09.280
Really?

12:09.280 --> 12:10.280
Is it by the beach?

12:10.280 --> 12:11.280
Yeah.

12:11.280 --> 12:12.280
Oh, cool.

12:12.280 --> 12:13.280
Um, anyway.

12:13.280 --> 12:16.280
They have white gauges in their shivers too.

12:16.280 --> 12:22.280
Of course the chat room's going, of course Rob doesn't eat fish, he's a fag, ha ha ha ha.

12:22.280 --> 12:26.160
funny. That joke was funny maybe ten years ago?

12:26.160 --> 12:32.040
Was that from the page of the 23rd? Yeah. Of course. Where else? Anyway, let's get

12:32.040 --> 12:39.320
into that big surprise I was talking about earlier. Yes, Zero has brought over his sex

12:39.320 --> 12:48.960
box and with that comes DDR UltraMix, which I have not seen at all yet and I think a lot

13:18.960 --> 13:23.960
plugging component cables into a RCA system.

13:23.960 --> 13:25.960
Yeah.

13:25.960 --> 13:31.960
Basically the way that the screen looks is kind of built up as if you're looking at a concert stage.

13:31.960 --> 13:34.960
It's got like a whole little set of ratchery type things on the side.

13:34.960 --> 13:40.960
And on the opening screen it has like spotlights on the top and it's mostly really bright white.

13:40.960 --> 13:44.960
And out of all of those EDR games it has the coolest menu music.

13:44.960 --> 13:45.960
Yeah.

13:45.960 --> 13:51.820
Agree so far just with the menus and everything. I've been incredibly impressed so yeah, I'm sorry Jamie

13:55.560 --> 13:57.420
Yeah, it does I'm kind of surprised okay

13:57.420 --> 14:03.180
I want to see I have heard that do that thing has a really scandalous gay video

14:03.180 --> 14:06.380
Yeah, you know I want to see it. We figured that you would like this video

14:06.380 --> 14:09.860
I must do that thing so if we could play do that thing, please

14:09.860 --> 14:13.860
And then you guys can hear this, too.

14:13.860 --> 14:15.860
This is a funny song.

14:15.860 --> 14:18.860
I think we're okay. I'll just...

14:21.860 --> 14:23.860
Oh, you better watch the video.

14:23.860 --> 14:26.860
Oh. Yeah!

14:29.860 --> 14:32.860
Okay, there's like... Wow.

14:32.860 --> 14:43.360
This is the gayest video I've ever seen in my life. There's like women in fur and half-naked men.

15:02.860 --> 15:13.260
these two chicks are standing in front of a microphone that says the name of their band

15:13.260 --> 15:18.860
the size it's very britney spears to me they look like britney spears clones i guess it's

15:18.860 --> 15:25.860
girls

15:31.140 --> 15:34.260
oh my god they're not wearing pants that's awesome

15:34.260 --> 15:41.260
god damn it why can't this be in color

15:41.260 --> 15:48.260
Ready Steady Go by Paul Oakenfold

16:11.260 --> 16:16.260
kostjamrh ready steady go by Paul Kvoltz

16:46.260 --> 17:08.140
But they got all the elements of the song, like perfect, and what I'm really impressed

17:08.140 --> 17:15.900
of is the fact that almost all the songs, like the license lines, they all have really

17:15.900 --> 17:43.180
p0k3smot42o

17:43.180 --> 17:46.180
Strictly the motherfucker

17:51.180 --> 17:54.180
Strictly the motherfucker

17:55.180 --> 17:57.180
Ready, steady, go

17:57.180 --> 18:18.660
All right, that was Ready Steady Go by Paul Ogenfold.

18:18.660 --> 18:22.500
We're playing DDR UltraMix here on Orange Laundry Radio.

18:22.500 --> 18:25.120
No webcam tonight, guys, sorry.

18:25.120 --> 18:28.120
We haven't been able to get it working again since the computer upgrade.

18:28.120 --> 18:35.120
And we can't hook UltraMix directly into our video card either, because we don't have that either.

18:35.120 --> 18:42.120
They also have a cool song that, of course, most people know it, Castles in the Sky.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.120
Yeah, Castles in the Sky, most people know that song already.

18:44.120 --> 18:47.120
They did a really good job with the stuff for that too.

18:47.120 --> 18:52.120
Let's hear one of the remixes. I'd like to play one of the new remixes for everybody.

18:52.120 --> 18:54.120
The two remixes that are on here right now...

18:54.120 --> 18:56.120
What are the unlocks so far? What have you unlocked?

18:56.120 --> 19:04.120
The unlocks that I've gotten so far are the Metal Gear Solid song from Beatania.

19:04.120 --> 19:07.120
Oh, this is Keep Your Body Movin' by Thuggy D.

19:07.120 --> 19:15.120
The cool thing about this Thuggy D guy is the fact that he remixed Absolute and Insertion.

19:15.120 --> 19:20.120
I think most people are pretty convinced that this is just Scotty D from Drop the Bomb.

19:20.120 --> 19:22.520
It's actually not really yeah

19:22.520 --> 19:33.520
Yeah, they have a link on the internet to where you can go and get his group information.

19:52.520 --> 20:01.520
This is very interesting, it's um, I haven't heard a DDR song about DDR in a long time.

20:01.520 --> 20:05.520
Really, I thought this was probably the worst song on the whole night.

20:05.520 --> 20:10.520
Yeah, this is definitely like an old stupid media song.

20:10.520 --> 20:21.520
It's interesting, I'll give it that.

20:21.520 --> 20:28.520
I also unlocked one of the Incident Prayers.

20:28.520 --> 20:41.520
Somebody had told me that Santa Milette, the BLT style, is in the MOC, actually.

20:41.520 --> 20:43.520
No, it's just already in there. It's out of the MOC.

20:43.520 --> 20:46.520
Oh, the remixed Santa Milette, the new one.

20:46.520 --> 20:47.520
I haven't heard that yet.

20:47.520 --> 20:50.520
Well, it's not new if you play 4 style, but...

20:50.520 --> 21:15.280
p0k3smot42o

21:15.280 --> 21:39.840
kostjamrh

23:09.840 --> 23:38.280
morsdraconis

23:38.280 --> 24:02.900
kostjamrh

25:02.900 --> 25:09.900
Here's your typical slowdown that you're used to in the normal insertion.

25:32.900 --> 25:41.900
kostjamrh No speed up at the end.

26:02.900 --> 26:11.900
I mean, I just wonder if they do make another one for the Xbox. If they do, um, from what I understand, this is just more of a promised catch, to bring one to it.

26:13.900 --> 26:17.900
What? Oh, yeah, it's more of a dance meeting.

26:17.900 --> 26:26.900
Yeah, I mean, if they do, for the fact, make a new one, I wonder if he's gonna be back doing more stuff. If he's gonna turn into, you know, a Scotty D, or...

26:26.900 --> 26:27.900
We'll see.

26:27.900 --> 26:32.900
All right, let's pull the plug on UltraMix for now.

26:32.900 --> 26:36.900
God, no, turn off the love to me, Jesus.

26:36.900 --> 26:37.900
All right.

26:37.900 --> 26:40.900
Yeah, we'll play that one.

26:40.900 --> 26:44.900
Maybe later in the show we'll get to the Metal Gear 1 and the shiny disco balls.

26:44.900 --> 26:46.900
Some people want to hear that too.

26:46.900 --> 26:53.900
Anyway, Ryan, you've been playing this more than anybody else here really.

26:53.900 --> 26:56.900
Being a DDR fan, what did you think of UltraMix?

26:56.900 --> 26:59.900
and compare it to Max 2 for PlayStation 2?

26:59.900 --> 27:05.900
Well, I mean, you can kind of compare it as out of the box that Max 2 would be better.

27:05.900 --> 27:16.900
But a lot of the redeeming qualities to the Xbox One is the fact that out of the box

27:16.900 --> 27:20.900
it's got a couple good remixes and it has a couple new songs that you haven't heard.

27:20.900 --> 27:25.900
And on top of that, it's more of a party game now for the fact that you can have

27:25.900 --> 27:32.200
four people playing in your house at the same time, which we actually tested around a little

27:32.200 --> 27:38.400
bit last night, and it's pretty fun because it gets pretty competitive. On top of that,

27:38.400 --> 27:43.700
of course, you have the Xbox Live stuff where you can get on there and play up to four people

27:43.700 --> 27:52.700
at once, transferring edits back and forth and stuff like that. I managed to play against

27:52.700 --> 27:58.340
one guy with an edit he had. And seriously, a lot of these people who made edits are really,

27:58.340 --> 28:04.180
really bad. It almost makes a lot of the Tournaments 4 stuff look good. I mean, it's that sad.

28:04.180 --> 28:07.380
About the Xbox Live, though, can you talk to them while you're playing?

28:07.380 --> 28:12.060
Yeah. When you buy an Xbox Live with the DDR pad, if you look in the front of the DDR pad,

28:12.060 --> 28:15.380
it has a part where you can hook your communicator in, and they give you like a six...

28:15.380 --> 28:16.380
Oh, so it's hooked to the pad?

28:16.380 --> 28:17.980
Yeah. And you can put a memory card in there, too.

28:17.980 --> 28:18.980
Oh.

28:18.980 --> 28:23.340
the cool thing is they give you a six foot extension for your headset. It only goes down

28:23.340 --> 28:27.260
about three feet. You can get a longer extension for it so you can talk while you're dancing.

28:27.260 --> 28:32.700
It goes into the controller port. Yeah. And another good thing too that I was really impressed

28:32.700 --> 28:38.660
with was the actual pad that comes with it if you buy it. I know a lot of people say,

28:38.660 --> 28:45.060
oh, we have really good anti-slip stuff. That pad on the Xbox, I got a running start about

28:45.060 --> 28:50.500
10 feet away, jumped up on it, and it didn't move anywhere. I was able to play stuff like

28:50.500 --> 28:56.500
Sugaru really, really well, double-aided. So, I mean, there's no problem with the pad.

28:56.500 --> 29:01.860
It's all a really, really good thing all around. And plus, the online stuff, you're gonna be

29:01.860 --> 29:05.700
able to download new characters, you're gonna be able to download new songs. And if they

29:05.700 --> 29:10.500
keep going at the rate they are with the new songs they've released onto the game itself,

29:10.500 --> 29:15.020
and they have those really good steps like that with the exception of a couple

29:15.020 --> 29:19.140
it's going to prove to be a very good

29:19.140 --> 29:23.380
one of my buddies had said he was playing the uh... ddr xbox online

29:23.380 --> 29:24.500
he was playing through xbox live

29:24.500 --> 29:25.980
and he was playing some guy

29:25.980 --> 29:29.220
when challenging him and then at the end he beat this guy and he heard over the

29:29.220 --> 29:30.260
microphone

29:30.260 --> 29:31.740
like he heard a kind of distance

29:31.740 --> 29:34.060
man this guy just beat me

29:34.060 --> 29:37.420
yeah he says this xbox live thing really makes

29:37.420 --> 30:00.420
Do you hear some of that chatter online is really funny?

30:00.420 --> 30:02.420
Except for the delay.

30:30.420 --> 30:35.420
Have you tried buying the new songs yet? I hear that you can buy five new songs for five bucks right now on Xbox Live.

30:35.420 --> 30:42.420
Yeah, you can. I actually haven't had a chance to do it yet, because my Cat5 cable is not long enough to reach my Xboxes, so I gotta do it somewhere.

30:42.420 --> 30:44.420
I might do it tonight before I leave here.

30:44.420 --> 30:45.420
Oh.

30:45.420 --> 30:48.420
Or maybe I can do it by the end of the show, since we have a spare cable.

30:48.420 --> 30:51.420
That'd be interesting, yeah. Actually, we have a spare cable. Maybe we could buy the songs.

30:51.420 --> 30:52.420
That'd be interesting.

30:52.420 --> 30:55.420
I can do it with no problem. I have all set up to do it.

30:55.420 --> 30:56.420
Alright.

30:56.420 --> 30:59.420
So we'll see what comes out. I don't know if they're selling characters yet, though.

30:59.420 --> 31:17.420
kostjamrh In My Eyes is in it and Mind Parasite

31:17.420 --> 31:24.420
kostjamrh I heard from what they are going to try to do is throw as much extreme stuff

31:24.420 --> 31:44.420
kostjamrh I had also heard that Santa Marte, the BLT style from 4 styles, is in there too, so that would be a fun unlock.

31:44.420 --> 31:57.420
kostjamrh The problem with the unlocks on here, and it's not even so much as a problem, it's like, after you play one song, which anyone who plays this probably won't mind knowing, the Metal Gear song from Beatmania is the first song you unlock.

31:57.420 --> 32:06.420
You unlocked Santa, if I remember correctly, by I think double A-ing or passing Santa on all difficulties.

32:06.420 --> 32:07.420
Really?

32:07.420 --> 32:09.420
Yeah, I'll have to try that.

32:09.420 --> 32:20.420
I also know that there's some, there is supposedly an unlock everything code, like how 2DX had, you know, what if you got like, what was it, 573 or something like that, it would unlock everything.

32:20.420 --> 32:27.500
everything. They're supposedly something like that on the Xbox, though I'm not sure exactly

32:27.500 --> 32:33.800
how they plan on having it done. I wouldn't say UltraMix is better than the Extreme Japanese

32:33.800 --> 32:41.540
yet, because it doesn't have as many songs. Out of the box, it's got like 38 songs, and

32:41.540 --> 32:46.940
you can only unlock like 9 more, which that's the real assy part about it. You know what,

32:46.940 --> 32:53.080
But though it's all credit for Ultramix, it's great because it's new.

32:53.080 --> 32:56.220
They've made old stuff look really new.

32:56.220 --> 33:01.040
They've kind of redone the interface, and like you said, the stage select music is awesome.

33:01.040 --> 33:05.540
They have some innovative new modes with the whole live play and the four player thing.

33:05.540 --> 33:07.380
They've really taken steps in the right direction.

33:07.380 --> 33:10.940
I've got to totally credit Konami of Hawaii for making an interesting DDR mix.

33:10.940 --> 33:15.760
I suppose also there's a mode with the arrows where if you step on a certain arrow, it gives

33:15.760 --> 33:18.160
more life tier, life bar or something like that too.

33:18.160 --> 33:22.280
Yeah, it's supposedly one of the unlockable modes. There's supposed to be two new unlockable

33:22.280 --> 33:23.280
modes. Wow.

33:23.280 --> 33:28.340
I just don't know about it yet. But yeah, I mean, this mix all together is shaping up

33:28.340 --> 33:32.240
to be really good, if they keep up on those downloads. I mean, it's really cool if they

33:32.240 --> 33:37.560
do have five new songs, but what I don't want to see is they go, you know, maybe a few weeks,

33:37.560 --> 33:41.160
because it's supposed to be like every two weeks I think they're going to do that, or

33:41.160 --> 33:46.200
once a month and what will be stupid is if they drop it after two months and they never

33:46.200 --> 33:51.440
do it because I don't think they will for the fact they can make the money but you know

33:51.440 --> 33:53.040
it's happened with stuff like that before.

33:53.040 --> 33:58.580
Let's see the unlockables. They've got of course the Metal Gear Solid 2 Mission R by

33:58.580 --> 34:05.280
LED from BeatMania. That's to unlock that you get any grade of an A on any song. Grade

34:05.280 --> 34:11.660
Radio 6 Cyber by Taka, that's another unlock, AA any song. Put Your Faith in Me Saturday

34:11.660 --> 34:18.620
Night Mix, quit a song. I quit it because my phone rang. And Paranoia Rebirth, get a

34:18.620 --> 34:24.840
C or higher up for Paranoia Eternal on all three difficulties. Colors for Extreme, play

34:24.840 --> 34:31.700
a lot of songs. It starts getting like that. Healing Vision and Angelic Mix, get a C or

34:31.700 --> 34:37.660
higher for Healing Vision on all three difficulties. Santa Mora, whatever, the BLT style for Santa

34:37.660 --> 34:45.060
is, yeah, C or higher for any Santa song, or for Santa on all three difficulties. Max

34:45.060 --> 34:52.060
300, double, triple A any song, or pass it on roulette, and Orion 78 Civilization Mix

34:52.060 --> 34:56.500
Beat Challenge Mode. So those are all the unlocks. I mean, that's, that's good unlock

34:56.500 --> 35:03.660
stuff though right there. Just, I'm just curious to see what they're gonna sell. If they sell

35:03.660 --> 35:08.660
any of the other Macs or anything. I still don't like the idea of unlocking old songs

35:08.660 --> 35:13.020
but since this is Xbox's first mix we'll let it slide and the fact that there is some really

35:13.020 --> 35:17.820
good stuff that you do unlock in there. There's the one concern though is that how people

35:17.820 --> 35:25.380
are gonna cheat the system. And the only, I think that people are gonna find a way to

35:25.380 --> 35:29.880
do it though to copy them not that I would encourage it you know I would

35:29.880 --> 35:34.680
expect for people to download well yeah like with the like what we do for

35:34.680 --> 35:43.620
Phantasy Star with the with the game shark and a laptop that's all you um but

35:43.620 --> 35:48.480
um you know I just I'd like to encourage you know for anyone who's listening who

35:48.480 --> 35:52.680
has the game or plans on getting it for the Xbox go ahead and buy your downloads

35:52.680 --> 35:59.680
Don't try to cheat the system, in this case.

35:59.680 --> 36:03.680
Yeah, because then they'll make new DDRs and blah blah blah, everybody's happy.

36:03.680 --> 36:13.680
For the simple case, if you're buying the Xbox version, obviously you're buying it so you can play online and so you can download new songs.

36:13.680 --> 36:20.680
kostjamrh And DDR will be dead and it will be all your fault!

36:43.680 --> 36:50.800
Way out there statement I'm going to get my butt kicked for, but maybe if DDR is successful

36:50.800 --> 36:55.800
enough on the Xbox, Microsoft will have the balls to tell them to bring 2DX over here.

36:55.800 --> 37:01.320
Because that could be something that could make a lot of people interested in an Xbox

37:01.320 --> 37:02.320
really fast.

37:02.320 --> 37:05.640
Okay, here's the thing. If they're going to do something like that, they have to make

37:05.640 --> 37:09.840
the key presses and stuff and the songs and everything as good as they have done on some

37:09.840 --> 37:13.320
of these with the steps and the song choices. As long as they do that, I would have no problem

37:13.320 --> 37:16.840
buying it. But if it comes to the point where they're going to release another crappy ass

37:16.840 --> 37:22.320
US mix, I will refuse to buy it or even play it. And it's just going to get that bad.

37:22.320 --> 37:28.240
Rumor is, now take this with a grain of salt, rumor is apparently this is published in some

37:28.240 --> 37:34.160
Konami newsletter in Japan this week. 7th Style is on its way, 80 songs. So we'll see.

37:34.160 --> 37:37.520
Happy. We don't know any details yet, but we will

37:37.520 --> 37:41.200
keep our eyes posted. Well, you know what I was thinking that it

37:41.200 --> 37:47.300
it could be possible for them to do especially on Xbox, keyboard mania. There is a US keyboard

37:47.300 --> 37:53.720
mania released for PC. Yeah, I remember we talked about it on one show here and information

37:53.720 --> 37:59.520
was scarce as it is, so it was a really under promoted thing. I mean just think about it,

37:59.520 --> 38:06.520
if it's on the PC it can go on the Xbox no problem. Right. So, perhaps they might decide

38:06.520 --> 38:11.120
might decide to try that one. It'd be, you know, the way keyboard mania was, you know,

38:11.120 --> 38:15.840
a very small market, but bring it out, put enough of a price tag on it, and they'll make

38:15.840 --> 38:16.840
their money back.

38:16.840 --> 38:20.720
I know. If there was enough interest to keep that PC one alive when we barely know anything

38:20.720 --> 38:27.080
about it, and, you know, some people actually consider our station a source of news, shock,

38:27.080 --> 38:30.240
we barely know anything about it. I don't know how this keyboard mania's thing's making

38:30.240 --> 38:31.880
its money on PC, but...

38:31.880 --> 38:39.000
One last thing about the UltraMix that's kind of cool is if you have a metal pad for the

38:39.000 --> 38:45.440
PlayStation 2, you can go to Fry's or whatever your main heavy hitter electronics store is

38:45.440 --> 38:51.520
and buy a little $20 adapter and you can use it on the Xbox because it actually does work

38:51.520 --> 38:53.680
because it's mapped out to the buttons.

38:53.680 --> 38:57.680
So you can actually use your metal pads or even if you don't want to spend the money

38:57.680 --> 39:04.160
on a new Microsoft pad and you have PlayStation 1s laying all around, spend $21.74 and go

39:04.160 --> 39:12.800
and buy an adapter and you can play all your games. And it's really worth it for the fact

39:12.800 --> 39:17.600
that, I mean, some people also don't like the Xbox controller for pretty much anything

39:17.600 --> 39:21.040
or fighting games and stuff. You can always use your PlayStation controller too. It's

39:21.040 --> 39:22.040
worth using.

39:22.040 --> 39:28.880
Okay, you guys want to take a break or you want to just go into some how was your week,

39:28.880 --> 39:29.880
how was your day?

39:29.880 --> 39:32.080
Because I know we've got a lot to talk about here.

39:32.080 --> 39:36.680
Alright, well, Jamie, you were gone for some time here, so...

39:36.680 --> 39:37.680
Two whole weeks.

39:37.680 --> 39:38.680
Two whole weeks.

39:38.680 --> 39:39.680
That's a long time, you know.

39:39.680 --> 39:40.680
Well, how was your month?

39:40.680 --> 39:41.680
How was your day?

39:41.680 --> 39:50.840
Well, Ma and John went with me to Alabama, and we stayed at my grandmother's place.

39:50.840 --> 39:55.640
And basically it was a lot of running around in my grandma's car and finding people and

39:55.640 --> 40:01.280
seeing old friends and visiting and doing some gaming which made me happy because I

40:01.280 --> 40:06.080
haven't done any gaming since the last time I was in Alabama.

40:06.080 --> 40:10.240
Got to see a lot of people I really missed.

40:10.240 --> 40:13.120
We watched so many movies while I was there.

40:13.120 --> 40:18.160
Finally saw The Ring, finally, multiple times while I was there.

40:18.160 --> 40:23.260
And then we rented Ringu, and it was okay, but I liked the ring.

40:23.260 --> 40:31.200
And then we saw Scary Movie 3 and Kill Bill again, and the third Matrix movie, which was

40:31.200 --> 40:40.680
heh, which everything in that movie happened exactly how I expected it to, except for the

40:40.680 --> 40:48.080
very end, which I'm not going to spoil for anybody.

40:48.080 --> 40:50.080
I haven't seen it yet.

40:50.080 --> 40:53.080
I'm not answering any questions on that.

40:53.080 --> 40:54.080
He turns into a bunny.

40:54.080 --> 40:58.080
Yeah, he turns into a bunny and scampers off into the sunset.

40:58.080 --> 41:04.760
And you thought all those, how far does the rabbit hole thing go, was all just like, you

41:04.760 --> 41:05.760
know, metaphors.

41:05.760 --> 41:06.760
Uh-uh.

41:06.760 --> 41:13.920
He was, he was going on a skateboard in a little, you know, vest with a pocket watch

41:13.920 --> 41:16.920
going, I'm late.

41:16.920 --> 41:20.840
It was fighting Smith, and then all of a sudden, the wild stallions come in.

41:20.840 --> 41:30.160
Yeah, all of a sudden, Alex Schwinner shows up like, dude, we're in the wrong movie.

41:30.160 --> 41:33.160
Kill me now.

41:33.160 --> 41:41.600
Anyway, I really wanted to go to the French Quarter while I was there, but I didn't get

41:41.600 --> 41:42.600
to.

41:42.600 --> 41:43.600
We just...

41:43.600 --> 41:44.600
Pout.

41:44.600 --> 41:48.520
I got into New Orleans, drove back, although we did eat at a really nice buffet at the

41:48.520 --> 41:53.880
Beaux Ravages in Biloxi, and it was free.

41:53.880 --> 41:59.120
And let's see, I played DDR at cyber station in my build.

41:59.120 --> 42:01.920
The dance maniacs machine was gone and that made me cry.

42:01.920 --> 42:02.920
Really?

42:02.920 --> 42:10.480
Yeah, but the DDR machine there was kind of crap, so I twisted my knee playing on that

42:10.480 --> 42:11.480
machine.

42:11.480 --> 42:16.920
I hadn't played any DDR for a month because of that nasty sinus infection I had.

42:16.920 --> 42:19.520
I'd never got a chance to go find the BeatMania machine.

42:19.520 --> 42:21.720
I found out where it is.

42:21.720 --> 42:22.720
It was at the mall.

42:22.720 --> 42:26.840
I used to work at it, Springdale Mall, and they're renovating the mall.

42:26.840 --> 42:32.040
They're rebuilding the whole center of it, so they moved the machine actually to a little,

42:32.040 --> 42:38.720
I think it's like a network gaming place slash arcade, but it's over for anyone who lives

42:38.720 --> 42:44.500
in that area who might be listening to the show. It's on Moffitt Road by University.

42:44.500 --> 42:47.420
Just this little sort of hole-in-the-wall gaming place. But I didn't get a chance to

42:47.420 --> 42:48.420
go.

42:48.420 --> 42:49.420
I have an on-topic question.

42:49.420 --> 42:50.420
Ah.

42:50.420 --> 42:53.460
What is up with those networking gaming places? I've seen them popping up everywhere lately,

42:53.460 --> 42:57.580
like here in Sacramento where Orange Island is based. I've seen at least three brand new

42:57.580 --> 42:58.940
network gaming places in the area.

42:58.940 --> 43:01.660
There was one that we passed on the way up here.

43:01.660 --> 43:04.700
What did... Are they really that popular? I've never been to one in my life.

43:04.700 --> 43:06.740
They're gonna go the way of the dot com business.

43:36.740 --> 43:39.380
I completely forgot where I was, thank you very much.

43:39.380 --> 43:42.020
You were playing DDR in the BeatMania machine?

43:42.020 --> 43:46.700
Yeah, and I never got to play the BeatMania machine, so, but it's a, what I had been told

43:46.700 --> 43:52.820
it was a 6th mix and I wanted to play it.

43:52.820 --> 43:59.060
I took my mom out to dinner for her birthday at the original Oyster House, which is like

43:59.060 --> 44:01.300
the best seafood place in the universe.

44:01.300 --> 44:05.220
All the seafood that they cook there is all locally caught stuff.

44:05.220 --> 44:10.580
This is really yummy, fresh catfish and all kinds of food.

44:10.580 --> 44:11.580
Better than red lobster?

44:11.580 --> 44:19.420
Red lobster, okay, red lobster is good, but nothing beats fish caught in the Gulf.

44:19.420 --> 44:25.460
And I have to say this, you eat seafood out here, all the West Coast seafood does not

44:25.460 --> 44:30.600
taste as good as seafood caught on the East Coast, I'm sorry, it does not.

44:30.600 --> 44:35.320
It has this sort of weird flavor to it.

44:35.320 --> 44:39.400
Real seafood is in the south.

44:39.400 --> 44:43.440
And I got to eat fried okra, which made me happy, because nobody out here knows how to

44:43.440 --> 44:45.440
cook fried okra, right?

44:45.440 --> 44:47.040
Because they make it all slimy and icky.

44:47.040 --> 44:49.360
I ate the Cracker Barrel.

44:49.360 --> 44:58.320
It made me sick, because I'm not used to country cooking anymore, but it was pretty good.

44:58.320 --> 44:59.320
I enjoyed it.

44:59.320 --> 45:04.200
We ran into lots of movies, like I said.

45:04.200 --> 45:11.240
I got to see Undercover Brother, that was like the funniest movie ever.

45:11.240 --> 45:12.240
Not really much else happened.

45:12.240 --> 45:15.160
Oh yeah, we went to Walmart a lot.

45:15.160 --> 45:16.160
Super Walmart.

45:16.160 --> 45:17.800
There's two of them.

45:17.800 --> 45:19.120
I was so happy because I love Super Walmart.

45:19.120 --> 45:21.920
Now I've heard that associated with the South before.

45:21.920 --> 45:24.600
Well, they can't have Super Walmart out here.

45:24.600 --> 45:26.840
There's like one, and it's in, what, Chico?

45:26.840 --> 45:28.800
They're going to open a Super Walmart in Chico.

45:28.800 --> 45:32.800
But Chico is, you know, just like most rural parts of the nation, so...

45:32.800 --> 45:34.800
Well, maybe it's hardly rural.

45:34.800 --> 45:36.800
I know, but...

45:36.800 --> 45:38.800
I don't know how to put it. Forget it.

45:38.800 --> 45:40.800
But, um...

45:40.800 --> 45:43.800
Maybe it's this college town thing, I don't know.

45:43.800 --> 45:44.800
Maybe.

45:44.800 --> 45:47.800
But, um, the, uh...

45:47.800 --> 45:50.800
We went there, like, practically every night.

45:50.800 --> 45:52.800
It's like, we're bored, let's go to Walmart.

45:52.800 --> 45:53.800
So...

45:53.800 --> 45:55.800
Ah, it reminds me of college.

45:55.800 --> 46:00.800
When I was going to school, it was Walmart or Bruno's the grocery store to go get liquor, but I'm sorry

46:02.360 --> 46:07.740
I got my transcripts from school. Yay second go back to school. This is me off

46:07.740 --> 46:11.160
I ordered two copies of my transcripts, you know two sealed copies

46:11.320 --> 46:15.200
So if I go to one school or want to go to the other I can have both of those copies

46:16.240 --> 46:20.640
They only sent me one of them. So I have to call them and bitch and fuss and moan

46:21.680 --> 46:23.680
complain complain

46:23.680 --> 46:28.600
The flight back was bumpy.

46:28.600 --> 46:33.920
We went through this torrent right before we got into New Orleans and then there was

46:33.920 --> 46:38.560
an accident and it was all kind of crappy, but our flights left within five minutes of

46:38.560 --> 46:39.560
each other.

46:39.560 --> 46:45.480
We had everything timed so well, you know, when our flights were leaving and everything.

46:45.480 --> 46:51.280
The ride to Denver was bumpy, the flight to Sacramento was pretty smooth, and then I got

46:51.280 --> 46:53.280
in town and was like, hey, it's cold.

46:53.280 --> 46:58.060
By the way, Mobile has the most bipolar weather ever.

46:58.060 --> 46:59.060
It's like, I'm hot, I'm cold.

46:59.060 --> 47:00.060
I'm hot, I'm cold.

47:00.060 --> 47:01.060
I'm hot, I'm cold.

47:01.060 --> 47:02.060
It's like menopause or something.

47:02.060 --> 47:05.780
Anyway, it was really kind of warm.

47:05.780 --> 47:11.460
Of course, it was humid the whole time, but around Thursday-ish, it got really cold, like

47:11.460 --> 47:13.380
in the 50s or so.

47:13.380 --> 47:17.180
It was cold weather, and then Monday, hi, I'm hot.

47:17.180 --> 47:18.180
It's 80.

47:18.180 --> 47:30.220
look, the sun's out and people drive really slow there. I came back feeling really happy.

47:30.220 --> 47:35.880
That's the best place anyone can go for a vacation because it's relaxing. No one's going

47:35.880 --> 47:44.060
to rush you or anything. People are polite. California sucks. I mean, there's more to

47:44.060 --> 47:51.980
here. But I think the vast majority of people out here just suck. I said vast majority,

47:51.980 --> 47:56.340
not everybody. Of course, the people that I associate with that I consider my friends

47:56.340 --> 48:00.420
are in the non-suck portion of the community. Well, okay.

48:00.420 --> 48:07.100
But most everybody else. There's not as many polite people. No one's going to smile at

48:07.100 --> 48:13.540
you when you walk down the road, or nod their head high, or hold a door for you, or be considerate.

48:13.540 --> 48:17.980
you know people are too much in our hurry I smile at other people like when

48:17.980 --> 48:21.100
I've gotten a raise and they probably look at you like you just escaped from the asylum like when

48:21.100 --> 48:29.140
I've gotten a raise at work or something it just you never see the difference

48:29.140 --> 48:36.740
until you've been away from it for so long that it was just I don't know it was

48:36.740 --> 48:41.340
sort of almost disappointing to come back almost disappointing but I mean

48:41.340 --> 48:46.180
And this is, of course, where my home is, and I couldn't imagine living anywhere else.

48:46.180 --> 48:49.140
But still, it was just...

48:49.140 --> 48:54.200
I found myself getting homesick right when I got off the plane, so it was really weird.

48:54.200 --> 48:59.540
And as for my day, I got back and decided to try the test server for Ragnarok.

48:59.540 --> 49:04.940
So I'm on the Sacre server, enjoying it.

49:04.940 --> 49:09.140
I'm supposed to be finishing up the last chapter of my fanfic, but I've only barely started

49:09.140 --> 49:10.140
it.

49:10.140 --> 49:13.500
and

49:13.500 --> 49:16.660
you know work was work. One good thing though I found

49:16.660 --> 49:20.140
I realized once I counted everything up I only work six

49:20.140 --> 49:24.420
days this entire month. But you get paid for it all right?

49:24.420 --> 49:28.540
Oh hell yeah. Right on. Because we got two holidays this month

49:28.540 --> 49:31.660
my vacation and plus we get two days off for Thanksgiving

49:31.660 --> 49:36.660
so it works out cool for me.

49:36.660 --> 49:39.540
Anything else? I am glad to be back don't get me wrong. Welcome back.

49:39.540 --> 49:41.540
I am glad to be back.

50:09.540 --> 50:18.980
So I ended up playing some Guitar Freaks and some Fourth Plus and No Extreme and a little

50:18.980 --> 50:23.540
bit of F Zero.

50:23.540 --> 50:29.740
And earlier this week I was still sitting on my computer getting it all working fine.

50:29.740 --> 50:36.060
I'm kind of in the process right now of getting my copies of certain programs that I don't

50:36.060 --> 50:42.340
owned, put them on my computer, you know, so I was busy downloading my updated software

50:42.340 --> 50:49.020
and all that. And I got a few other games I need to try out, like I just got Simpsons

50:49.020 --> 50:53.980
Hit and Run, which looks pretty good, and then Celebrity Deathmatch, which looks kind

50:53.980 --> 51:01.300
of fun. And then Midnight Club 2 didn't work for me. For some reason, the image that it

51:01.300 --> 51:08.540
wanted me to burn was larger than the CD I have, so, that sucked. And then, what else?

51:08.540 --> 51:15.060
I've been working on a list of something for a secret something that I'll be, you know,

51:15.060 --> 51:21.500
doing later. I can't really say right now because I just can't. It's not close to completion

51:21.500 --> 51:29.460
yet. But, on this list right now, there's a good, oh, over 600 things on this list,

51:29.460 --> 51:36.540
so it's a long list that I need to work on. Anyways, so I've been doing that, and I was

51:36.540 --> 51:44.580
going to work on the web page for Orange Lounge, but I never got around to it, and yeah. And

51:44.580 --> 51:54.940
also, yeah, I don't know. My show's in limbo right now, too, so. I don't know. It's been

51:54.940 --> 52:01.620
like that, kind of like a whole week to spend in limbo. That's pretty much it.

52:01.620 --> 52:05.420
Alright, yeah, more programming notes to come after the next break. There's some important

52:05.420 --> 52:10.400
programming notes that we'll need to get out of the way and take care of. My week and my

52:10.400 --> 52:15.260
day was okay. I really didn't do anything too exciting this week. Monday night I took

52:15.260 --> 52:19.580
Magus and Angel home, so they know Sky was on Wednesday instead, and that was good. Oh,

52:19.580 --> 52:24.080
on the way to take Magus and Angel home, we stopped for Boba in Davis, and they have this

52:24.080 --> 52:28.600
awesome new flavor which is this coffee toffee flavor it's great

52:28.600 --> 52:31.880
uh... so there was that and then uh... friday

52:31.880 --> 52:35.600
uh... i went out to spike and mike sick and twisted festival of animation over

52:35.600 --> 52:36.680
downtown

52:36.680 --> 52:39.960
and that's the third year in a row i've gone and there's uh... some pretty funny

52:39.960 --> 52:40.960
shit this year

52:40.960 --> 52:44.560
uh... namely the ninjus was funny

52:44.560 --> 52:46.120
and uh...

52:46.120 --> 52:47.640
well so that was good

52:47.640 --> 52:51.400
something about this giant stick figure that was a condom that was pretty good

52:51.400 --> 52:53.860
happy tree friends as always was winner

52:53.860 --> 52:59.740
But the best, by far, was here comes Dr. Tran.

52:59.740 --> 53:01.940
Fucking hilarious.

53:01.940 --> 53:07.620
If you want to visit www.beyondgrandpa.com and get all the information on oh shit it's

53:07.620 --> 53:11.260
Dr. Tran, it's great and would be well worth your visit.

53:11.260 --> 53:12.980
So that was fun.

53:12.980 --> 53:15.580
And then yesterday I hung out with Jamie for a while where we worked on a couple of the

53:15.580 --> 53:21.620
new promos you'll be hearing and got to see my buddy Eddie, who's in from out of town,

53:21.620 --> 53:27.280
They made some home movies, not those kind of movies, and that was about it.

53:27.280 --> 53:29.600
And then today was okay.

53:29.600 --> 53:33.160
I woke up really late and then the power went out and that sucked.

53:33.160 --> 53:38.940
And then I hurried up and worked on the new intro and I was going to go out and meet Pixie

53:38.940 --> 53:43.260
Dust and no Stylin, but I didn't because Jamie was cooking, I remembered, so I didn't go

53:43.260 --> 53:46.200
out to meet them.

53:46.200 --> 53:50.220
And my eyes started hurting, which kind of sucked, but I took Tylenol and it's better

53:50.220 --> 53:51.220
now.

53:51.220 --> 53:57.100
I didn't catch whatever lanky style had because he had an eye infection the other day, but

53:57.100 --> 53:58.680
I don't think it was pink eye though.

53:58.680 --> 54:01.400
It was just something where the eyes were like really, really hurting.

54:01.400 --> 54:05.440
I don't know, but I think I'm okay because I took Tylenol and I feel better.

54:05.440 --> 54:07.280
So maybe it was just psychological.

54:07.280 --> 54:09.440
I don't know.

54:09.440 --> 54:14.160
So that was pretty much my week and my day.

54:14.160 --> 54:19.120
Anyway, Zero or Miko, you guys have anything you want to share about your week and your

54:19.120 --> 54:20.120
day?

54:20.120 --> 54:27.120
the show

54:27.420 --> 54:30.920
you talk into the microphone you just say hi people and

54:30.920 --> 54:37.920
this is what's good and this is what sucks whatever

54:39.300 --> 54:41.580
yes it is on

54:41.580 --> 54:43.660
if you don't talk they'll make me sing

54:43.660 --> 54:46.500
please talk

54:46.500 --> 54:47.720
no

54:47.720 --> 54:51.220

54:51.220 --> 54:55.860
stunts only

54:55.860 --> 54:57.520
would you do yesterday

54:57.520 --> 54:59.300
i can't remember

54:59.300 --> 55:01.040
did you go to the offline at all this week

55:01.040 --> 55:04.040
uh... yeah

55:04.040 --> 55:05.800
to play anything interesting later

55:05.800 --> 55:08.680
uh...

55:08.680 --> 55:10.960
tdr extreme

55:10.960 --> 55:12.200

55:12.200 --> 55:13.560
what uh... what

55:13.560 --> 55:14.760
what was like

55:14.760 --> 55:21.760
kostjamrh What was the last big song you passed in ddr extreme?

55:44.760 --> 55:49.760
nico looks like a poor deer in the headlights right now with a microphone in her hand

55:49.760 --> 55:54.760
they can hear me? can they?

55:54.760 --> 55:59.760
i could pass cartoon heroes when ddr extreme first came out too

55:59.760 --> 56:04.760
and then i didn't go for playing for a long time and i got fat and older and then i couldn't beat it

56:04.760 --> 56:09.760
but i can beat it again

56:09.760 --> 56:14.760
kostjamrh What do you think of Ultramix?

56:14.760 --> 56:19.760
kostjamrh What do you think of Ultramix?

56:44.760 --> 57:09.520
p0k3smot42o

57:09.520 --> 57:10.520
Okay.

57:10.520 --> 57:11.520
And Rancho.

57:11.520 --> 57:12.520
Okay.

57:12.520 --> 57:16.260
Is that the one that says Dunkin' Donuts, too?

57:16.260 --> 57:17.260
I guess not.

57:17.260 --> 57:18.260
Forget it.

57:18.260 --> 57:21.100
No, but we have the coffee by Dunkin' Donuts.

57:21.100 --> 57:22.100
All right.

57:22.100 --> 57:23.100
Good enough.

57:23.100 --> 57:30.900
And what's the third one, if you're willing to share?

57:30.900 --> 57:33.100
And I work at my school.

57:33.100 --> 57:34.740
All right.

57:34.740 --> 57:35.740
Yeah.

57:35.740 --> 57:37.740
Hooray for school.

57:37.740 --> 57:40.220
pay for school

57:40.220 --> 57:45.220
that's why i like going to school is because i get paid

57:45.220 --> 57:47.580
all right right on

57:47.580 --> 57:48.900
okay so uh...

57:48.900 --> 57:52.900
let's hear from zero we haven't heard from zero yet how uh... how was your week in your day

57:52.900 --> 57:54.380
mister zero

57:54.380 --> 57:58.580
no it was okay my week. You have your lower lip sticking out like you're pouty about something

57:58.580 --> 58:02.860
i had to spend like every dime i had on my piece of shit

58:02.860 --> 58:04.460
fucking car

58:04.460 --> 58:11.100
You know, I only paid $100 for that car, so I wouldn't feel so bad if I set it in a nice,

58:11.100 --> 58:15.180
happy roll and then jumped out and let it crash into a wall or incoming traffic.

58:15.180 --> 58:16.180
It's...

58:16.180 --> 58:18.380
God, my door doesn't shut!

58:18.380 --> 58:23.580
So I had to tie it with a shoestring.

58:23.580 --> 58:24.580
You tellin' me it's ghetto!

58:24.580 --> 58:27.220
I know my car's ghetto.

58:27.220 --> 58:33.060
It's not easy to fix, it's just I don't have the $50 for the stuff that I need to fix it.

58:33.060 --> 58:38.720
I'm kind of pissed off for the fact that it says that the song pack 1 for Ultramix is

58:38.720 --> 58:43.980
released and yet they won't update their fucking sites to tell you what's out.

58:43.980 --> 58:46.780
There's a lot of stuff that Xbox Live is screwing up on right now.

58:46.780 --> 58:50.300
Somebody had showed me a site that had the X... I thought it was an Xbox site.

58:50.300 --> 58:53.420
No, I know it tells... No, it's not... I'll tell you right now it's not Xbox because I'm

58:53.420 --> 58:56.060
on it. They're just totally making it look like crap.

58:56.060 --> 58:59.580
They're still stuck in October now.

58:59.580 --> 59:04.100
I would know anything about websites that never update. I've never heard of this.

59:04.100 --> 59:05.220
Of course you haven't.

59:05.220 --> 59:07.840
No, never. No, not at all.

59:07.840 --> 59:11.300
Just like my live journal that never updates. But anyways,

59:11.300 --> 59:12.140
so uh...

59:12.140 --> 59:14.100
there's that, and

59:14.100 --> 59:17.460
of course I got UltraMix, so I had a lot of fun with that.

59:17.460 --> 59:22.380
Also, I started playing a little bit of uh... I think you need an UltraMix party.

59:22.380 --> 59:26.440
I was thinking about it. I just gotta figure out how to plan it and when to.

59:26.440 --> 59:28.340
I mean, I know how to plan it, I just don't know when.

59:28.340 --> 59:30.340
p0k3smot42o I think I need to finish my cabinet

59:58.340 --> 01:00:04.340
kostjamrh And she cooked us dinner tonight, so do launder here all you want. Bring fish and you can, uh...

01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:10.340
kostjamrh Now I know why we couldn't download anything. I'm looking at their service status, and it says that it's down.

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:12.340
kostjamrh Huh, that sucks.

01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:16.340
kostjamrh And I bet you if I go back to it, it'll say that it's up, and then it'll say it's down.

01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:21.340
kostjamrh But, um, no yeah, I want to get everybody together, just to come over and have another b-money party because I miss it.

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:28.340
parties are fun. And I'm sorry I missed your last one. I think I just was having my period.

01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:25.160
I want to get everybody together just because we haven't done it in a long time and every

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:30.480
time we get together it's a lot of fun.

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:31.480
No idea.

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.720
We don't know a lot of these people in our chat room, they're just there.

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:34.960
They just started showing up.

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:38.920
They just started showing up and we haven't kicked them out yet, so.

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:39.920
They're our neighbors, you're friends.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:43.140
No, we love all our new chatters, hello to all the new chatters.

01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:48.160
I've seen some new faces pop up this past couple weeks, so it's exciting.

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.160
And our old chatters too.

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:52.800
and xbox lives up now one of the odds of that one

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:56.120
it's everywhere now

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.480
we're not just we're fucking big it's sad

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:01.520
uh... anything else you want to share about your week and your day

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.440
i managed to make it here today

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:06.880
congratulations that is an accomplishment honestly throughout this christmas season

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.840
i have no idea how many days i'm gonna be here

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:11.040
cuz it's

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:15.000
i work in the mall i mean

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.880
it's alright you know

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:25.880
Well, here's the thing is that I'm trying to get coming back here every week, now that I have a car and stuff, kinda, that walks really fast but doesn't run.

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:35.880
Um, once I get my, once I get this work schedule figured out, there'll be some nights hopefully I'll get here, either that or I'll just come here late, if anything, so...

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:39.880
Yeah, the mall closes at six, right? So you guys are out there by seven.

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:40.880
Extended hours now.

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:41.880
DOPE!

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:45.880
Yeah, so I mean, there's some people closing way late for no apparent reason.

01:02:45.880 --> 01:03:05.880
kostjamrh You know who his boss is?

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:10.280
Yes, I know who his boss is.

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:14.040
And you think his boss would be sympathetic to the situation that there's this Orange

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:19.320
Lounge radio program, but no, that just makes him want to make him work more on Sunday nights.

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:20.320
Anyway.

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:22.320
I heard you're going to want TDX.

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:23.320
What?

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:24.320
You heard what?

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:25.840
What did you hear?

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:28.040
I heard that TDX is going to be at SunSplash.

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:34.120
Yeah, that's a rumor that always comes up, but we don't, I think they want to get it,

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:38.340
but maybe the people that actually buy the games don't.

01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:39.340
Oh man.

01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:40.340
Okay.

01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:44.620
They were gonna get Derby Owners Club, that's before they found out it was gonna be $60,000

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:49.260
for a four-player cabinet, and they said fuck it because it's been out for a while and it's

01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:53.840
not making the money it used to, and it would take like over a year to make the money back

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:54.840
on it.

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:55.840
So they said fuck it.

01:03:55.840 --> 01:04:00.840
But they do have $120,000 to spend on arcade games for this coming year.

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:06.300
So it's a possibility. I honestly don't want it there, because I think it'll get fucked

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:11.580
up the same way that, you know, the one that Scandia does.

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:12.580
Speaking of which...

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:18.140
And I'd rather them, like, upgrade their complete mix too to beat me to the final, or even,

01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:22.260
like, I don't know if it's a possible upgrade machine to a beat me to three the final or

01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:27.380
something like that. But I'd rather them do that, because at least it gets some play out

01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:36.700
of it and clean up the machine a bit and replace the coin door on it and stuff. But, what else?

01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:45.780
Oh, they were, well, they're supposed to get another DDR machine there. I can't say. But,

01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:49.740
there's a new, there's possibly a new DDR machine coming in there. It's Tori, it's from

01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:56.740
scandia

01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:24.660
No, it gets even better. They left the bass speakers on there because you can't really

01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:32.540
get rid of them. It's like they went to Kmart and bought a $150 little mini stereo system

01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:38.440
because there's two really shitty speakers on top, like the detachable ones off of a

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:43.060
boom box or something. They're sitting up there like, you can't hear it, of course.

01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:52.020
I mean, it wouldn't even matter. They don't care anymore. I've actually heard them say

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:57.640
they don't care anymore. That was the, you know, the shift managers were saying that,

01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:02.360
and also the main guy there doesn't care. They care more about that stupid fucking hick

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:08.740
shooter game than they care about anything else, because people have been blowing money

01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:09.740
in their left and right.

01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:16.520
That's what we need to be teaching the people in the ghetto, to shoot white people.

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:20.000
I would love to take the camera over to Scandi and get a picture of that ascii machine though.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.960
It's their 2DX machine works.

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:25.680
And it's a miracle.

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.400
I've got some Scandi tokens I need to blow.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:32.860
No, I think I want to actually call the owners.

01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:34.040
I think I, you know...

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.000
Have a ball.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.320
I have all the stuff to hook a recorder up to my telephone.

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:39.120
Record the conversation, put it on air, it'll be funny.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.120
I'll do it.

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:45.440
Not if you said that you were recording at the beginning of the phone call.

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:49.240
That's why every time you call a customer service place, they say this call may be recorded.

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:52.920
You want to interview them for a local radio station?

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:56.000
I'll do it.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.780
Why does your arcade suck so bad?

01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:00.780
Nobody cares.

01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:02.000
Why are you losing money?

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.800
They asked me that again the other day.

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:09.280
shift magic guy comes up. And this is the guy who's like, oh man, you should apply here

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:13.200
because it seems like you really care about the games. I'm like, no, thank you. But he's

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:17.480
like, why are all your friends not coming here anymore? I said, look at your DDR machine.

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:22.400
And he's like, what? And I said, it looks like my computer on top of some speakers.

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:26.400
There's no, there's nothing on there. And he said, yeah, well that's because the speakers

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:29.400
didn't work. I said, if the speakers didn't work, you don't have to take the whole top

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:34.040
off. And he's like, yeah, there's some other legal issues coming up. So how about this?

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.040
Keith went to RVGL.

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:45.040
Well no, it's not that. They said legal issues came up, so I wonder if someone ragged on them about having their extreme or something like that.

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:51.040
Oh please, that would be the first case I've ever heard of anywhere where somebody said something like that.

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:54.040
Well for the fact that they said legal issues makes me wonder what it was.

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:57.040
They're retarded, they don't know what the hell they're talking about.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:01.040
Some stupid baby fell off the machine and now they have a lawsuit.

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:09.040
My kid was climbing the machine, fell down, and cracked his head open, so you need to, like, remove that so he doesn't climb.

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:13.040
Darwin, doesn't that work?

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:15.040
So, I don't know. I think Scandia is gonna-

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:20.040
The music coming from that machine is making my child gay!

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:24.040
You need to remove that machine! It's making people gay!

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.040
No. Last-

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:32.040
Why do we have to listen to all this jap music? We live in the United States of America, not Japan!

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:36.040
Keep your music to your own country! Thank you!

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:09.040
For the record, I love the artichoke dip from the heffalup bar.

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:36.040
Anyway, let's take a break, because we've gone like an hour now without a break.

01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:39.040
So I think we need to take a break. When we come back, we're going to have...

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:41.040
I want to do a cage match first. We're going to do a cage match first?

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:45.040
Fine. We'll do a cage match first. We'll do that fuse later.

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:52.040
Cage match when we come back from this break with more just cornucopia of Bimani music.

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:59.040
back.

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:25.040
My emotions still remain

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:28.040
All my heart still yearns cause the fire still burns

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:32.040
I can't put out the pain

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:37.040
I would never, never assume to leave me with a mental wound

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:44.040
You know the reason why I cannot give and forget

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:47.040
You have left me not for life

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:50.240
Bitch, what's got like a night?

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:57.040
I can't forgive and forget

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:04.640
Can't forgive and forget

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:11.640
You've only got yourself to blame.

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:57.120
Baby, it's all live gold Baby, it's all live gold

01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:03.120
She's the one I'd like to call, whoa Baby, it's all it does

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:07.120
Ride forever, can't wait until tomorrow

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:35.120
I want you baby, maybe tonight

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:37.120
I take you far away

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:40.120
I see you dancing

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:43.120
Shining like a jewel

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:45.120
Burning for love

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:49.120
In the golden light of love inside of

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:52.120
My pride, my heaven

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:55.120
Your precious fire for me

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:57.120
Baby, it's all in gold

01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:01.120
Reaching out, I don't wanna let you go

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:03.120
Baby, it's all in gold

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:10.120
Baby it's all this gold, shine forever, can't wait till tomorrow

01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:15.120
Baby it's all this gold, reaching out I don't wanna let you go

01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:21.120
Baby it's all this gold, shine forever, can't wait till tomorrow

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:34.120
I need you, baby

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:36.120
What is it for you?

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:59.120
I think you have my feelings My hopes are far away, so please

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:05.120
He got a dream in his face He got a shadow of a dream

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:09.120
It's time to say goodbye to my face

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:14.120
I don't want you alone I pray you'll be happy

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:18.120
It's my time, I need to say that

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:20.120
That's the place for you

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:24.120
You don't have to let me get to be who you should be

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:26.120
That's the place for you

01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:30.120
I can make it through, but I don't do it anymore

01:14:56.120 --> 01:15:20.560
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:24.040
the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:29.540
Um, Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music & More program. Can we talk about that?

01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:32.040
No subject will ever be taboo.

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:36.040
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights?

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:39.040
Except, of course, the subject that was just under discussion.

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:45.040
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:47.040
I collect your fucking head.

01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:50.040
Just like this fucker here.

01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:52.040
What the fuck is going on here?

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:22.040
How's everybody doing?

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:27.040
I'm getting pissy because I can't find the cage match pick I want for tonight on my computer.

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:32.040
It's been on the whole time.

01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:37.040
No, it's okay because it's muted. I can mute them here and then they don't go past my computer.

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:40.040
What's up?

01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:41.040
Hi Rob.

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:42.040
Hi.

01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:43.040
Rob.

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:44.040
Rob.

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:45.040
What?

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:46.040
Rob.

01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:47.040
What?

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:48.040
Rob.

01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:49.040
What?

01:16:49.040 --> 01:17:08.320
So did you hear about last week's cage match?

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:12.840
Because I didn't have a song for you, we did a reverse cage match and we nominated four

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:17.800
songs to be booted off the station forever and did you know that Loki chose one of his

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:24.800
songs to be banned from the station forever.

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:51.800
What would I have a problem with that note?

01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:46.800
The first song you can vote for tonight, I would say last week's winner, but it's actually two weeks ago's winner.

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:51.600
It's Battle Without an Honor or Humanity, the 88 Severed Limbs mix by the one and only

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:52.600
Loki.

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:53.600
Enjoy!

01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:57.080
You only get to hear a clip of it because it did win last week, so we'll start it about

01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:04.080
halfway in.

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:29.080
I failed all the rest, wanna raise the top ten

01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:31.080
Stop lookin', I took you five to the right hand

01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:33.080
Now I just need you to be the best of a black man

01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:35.080
This wisdom wasn't made the way, so it's not planned

01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:37.080
This hell is an actual terror

01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:39.080
They make me move, they fight it up every day

01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:41.080
So go and fuck it through them, they change it in like a modern parade

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:43.080
Don't combine, they say what the savage is, we're the only swine

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:45.080
This thing, there's only one spade

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.080
This body, I'm at the hop, I'm ready to sing him a song

01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:49.080
I wanna run, come on, there may be no peace, no smoke

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:50.080
We don't need

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:32.080
The first song you can vote for tonight is Battle Without a Honor or Humanity, the 88-7

01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:42.360
Limbs mix, so you can vote for that one, or you can vote for this next one, which is Jamie's

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:43.360
pick.

01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:44.920
Hey, stop fighting about Para-Para.

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:48.320
We're trying to do a show here, hello.

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:50.320
Jamie, what song did you pick for tonight's Cade Mass?

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.320
I forgot. Something by Utah Saints.

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:54.320
Yes, it's FIFA 2001, actually.

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:58.320
I think it was done for FIFA 2001, but it's something else and I couldn't find the title again.

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.320
So we'll just call it FIFA 2001.

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:01.320
Okay.

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:03.320
Alright, so this is Jamie's pick for tonight's Cade Mass.

01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:06.320
They say the title, and they end the song, though, somewhere.

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:07.320
Okay.

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:09.320
Something Hyperbeat or something.

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:12.320
Alright. Well, any particular reason you're picking this song?

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:15.320
Because I like Utah Saints, and we've never had one, so I picked one.

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:21.340
All right here it is second song you can vote for tonight Jamie's pick Utah Saints with FIFA 2001 enjoy

I like Utah Saints, it gets a 9.

01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:44.040
p0k3smot42o I actually really did enjoy that song and I wish I would have heard it before now.

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:49.040
I think it was definitely a good song. I would give it an 8 or 9.

01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:53.040
Okay. I had asked Mika what she thinks because she's on the phone, so she loses.

01:25:53.040 --> 01:26:00.040
Alright, so there's song number 2 you can vote for tonight. Utah Saints with Power to the People?

01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:05.040
Beats. Power to the Beats. Power to the People!

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:12.040
Alright. The song I wanted to pick for tonight's Cajun Match I couldn't find and that kind of pisses me off.

01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:46.440
I think I wasn't really listening now. What do you think of it on scale one to ten?

01:26:46.440 --> 01:27:03.760
I don't know. Can we listen to it again? No, we can't listen to it again.

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:05.760
No, it's a 1, by default.

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:39.440
Hey, my pick for tonight is from a new dance compilation out there.

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:42.640
It's Now Dance 2004 from Britain.

01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:47.320
And this is Mel C, one of the Spice Girls, but that's okay, it's the Spice Girl that

01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:48.320
can sing.

01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:49.320
Baby Spice?

01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:50.320
Sporty Spice.

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:51.320
The Daiki one.

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.320
Daiki Spice.

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:53.320
The one with the bad teeth?

01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:54.320
Yes.

01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:55.320
Oh.

01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:56.320
They all have bad teeth.

01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:57.320
They're British.

01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:58.320
Just kidding.

01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:02.160
This is the one that Did I Turn to You from DanceMania X8, which is a pretty popular song.

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:03.520
And this is a new single from her.

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:09.360

Expect me not to disappear, fearing you won't fall in love

01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:58.520

We're gonna have a good time

01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:27.520
Gonna have a good time

All right, that was Mel C with Yeah Yeah Yeah.

01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:03.080
Jamie.

01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:04.080
What?

01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:07.440
Mel C, Yeah Yeah Yeah.

01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:13.340
It was kind of repetitive and made me think of that Britney Spears song that's in Fifth

01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:14.340
Mix.

01:32:14.340 --> 01:32:18.340
So, no offense, but it gets like a 6.8.

01:32:18.340 --> 01:32:20.340
Alright, Logie.

01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:31.340
You know, this just goes to show you, you know, they can leave the Spice Girls, but they still suck.

01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:35.340
I don't care if she dead, I turn to you, this is crap.

01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:38.340
It gets a 3, because it's good.

01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:12.340
It still sucks and it gets less than a zero.

01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:14.340
It gets less than me.

01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:18.340
No, that sucked. I never want to hear it again. It gets like a one.

01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:20.340
That's it.

01:33:20.340 --> 01:33:23.340
All right, Nico?

01:33:23.340 --> 01:33:27.340
It's good. I give it a one.

01:33:27.340 --> 01:33:29.340
What the hell is that?

01:33:29.340 --> 01:33:30.340
Crack.

01:33:30.340 --> 01:33:34.340
Jonas, hello, but you don't get to vote on that because you didn't get to vote on the others.

01:33:34.340 --> 01:33:35.340
I'm sorry.

01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:36.340
That's all right, but hello.

01:33:36.340 --> 01:33:37.340
How are you?

01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:39.340

Here's a quick recap.

01:33:47.820 --> 01:33:50.420
Song number one, Battle Without a Honor or Humanity,

01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:51.620
the 88-several limb mix.

01:33:51.620 --> 01:33:53.080
This is a battle without a humanity.

01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:54.540
This is a battle without a humanity.

01:33:54.540 --> 01:33:58.140
This is a battle without a humanity.

01:33:58.140 --> 01:33:59.180
All right.

01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:00.900
Song number two you can vote for tonight

01:34:00.900 --> 01:34:05.420
is Utah Saints with FIFA 2001, the, what the hell's

01:34:05.420 --> 01:34:06.100
name of it again?

01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:07.060
Power to the Beats.

01:34:07.060 --> 01:34:14.060
How are the beats? Thank you.

01:34:15.380 --> 01:34:22.380
And song number three you can vote for tonight is Mel C with Yeah Yeah Yeah.

01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:31.700
Alright, send those votes over private message now now now to Sky.

01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:34.980
I'm in the chat room. Hello, how are you?

01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:41.980
Wait, Jamie, before you get to the picture thing, because we're not ready for a break yet, I wanted to talk, because I know you wanted to talk about this earlier.

01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:48.980
You picked up a new game this week, you passed up Ultramix to get your Eurobeat collection, but you did get a new game this week, right?

01:34:48.980 --> 01:34:50.980
Final Fantasy X-2, not X.

01:34:50.980 --> 01:34:51.980
Final Fantasy X-2.

01:34:51.980 --> 01:34:55.980
Dear people, it's X, not X. Roll the numerals. Say it with me.

01:34:55.980 --> 01:34:58.980
Ten-two.

01:34:58.980 --> 01:34:59.980
Everybody?

01:34:59.980 --> 01:35:00.980
X-2? Twelve?

01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:02.980
Is it Final Fantasy X-2?

01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:07.660
To piss Jamie off, I'll be calling it X2 all night long. X2? So what did you think of X2?

01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:09.420
I don't know. That game doesn't exist.

01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:11.720
What did you think of Final Fantasy XII?

01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:14.820
You know, the posters for that game look pretty neat.

01:35:14.820 --> 01:35:16.900
And the main character is hot.

01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:21.220
And actually, yes, they do have pictures of the game up on the internet now.

01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:27.220
So what did you think about Final Fantasy... I mean Charlie's Angels, the game.

01:35:29.220 --> 01:35:31.500
That was just like... That was great.

01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:38.100
I love the game. I'm having a great time with it. Although, my big disappointment came when

01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:43.820
they brought in my man, because in the Japanese version, my favorite voice actor is his voice,

01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:50.700
the guy with one leg. And his voice is okay in the US one, but I'm getting a Japanese

01:35:50.700 --> 01:35:58.500
one coming up probably in a month or so, so I get to hear it later. But it's not bad.

01:35:58.500 --> 01:36:02.980
The whole Al Bhed thing is back, you know, where you pick up the primer and everything,

01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:05.940
but it doesn't really interfere with the game.

01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:06.940
It's pretty neat so far.

01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:10.420
I'm about, I think, up on the fourth, fifth mission.

01:36:10.420 --> 01:36:18.060
I'm enjoying it, although you make sure that you have plenty of healing implements and

01:36:18.060 --> 01:36:21.820
as much magic refill things as you can right at the beginning of the game, because it gets

01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:22.820
pretty tough.

01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:27.100
But the whole dress fear thing is pretty neat.

01:36:27.100 --> 01:36:31.120
i'll probably pick it up and play through it because i play through ten and play through

01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:33.240
all the other ones and

01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:37.180
that's what i do

01:36:37.180 --> 01:36:40.280
oh yeah

01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:44.440
ah dark child says that at E3 they called it X2

01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:47.680
they're idiots

01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:52.720
just sayin'

01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:56.360
one two three four five six seven eight nine X is not actually how it is

01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:59.760
i don't know if there isn't make a man they're just uh... tailgating off the

01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:01.000
uh... expert

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.440
i don't know you see cuz i would find that person

01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:05.860
and shoot them in the head

01:37:05.860 --> 01:37:10.260
access you know i really like final fantasy v i i i

01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:12.280
it was really cool but

01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:15.720
this one's okay to you i guess

01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:18.400
i think everybody should get over it it's a game name

01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:20.880
but uh... thanks to uh...

01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:23.300
uh... to uh... link uh...

01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:30.060
provided by, who did I get that from? From Nikari earlier. We've got an MP3 of the English

01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:33.660
opening. Yes, and I have to... We're going to need to skip forward just a little bit

01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:36.620
in the MP3 because... Well, I'm going to have to unpack it first, but we'll get to that

01:37:36.620 --> 01:37:38.860
after everybody's review. We'll get to it after everybody's review, because I have to

01:37:38.860 --> 01:37:44.060
unpack it first. Yeah, it's, you know what? They had another version of the intro, because

01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:48.980
they translated the intro. The one that they were going to do, oh my God, they had the

01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:58.380
worst singer ever. It sounded worse than the Busta Move 2 music. No, no, no, no, no. No,

01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:04.180
they actually had an English speaking person doing the intro, the last person, and it really

01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:10.340
sucked. Kotokumi was actually pretty good, her English one, but she put very odd pauses

01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:16.040
in it and so it wouldn't have worked out. Too many people would have just been really

01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:20.760
stupid over it and not liked it, even though her voice is absolutely awesome.

01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:25.320
I like her voice better than the one they got, but the final person they settled with

01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:29.480
though has a really nice voice and did the song justice, I thought.

01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:38.920
But it's still the same intro for everyone who's seen the Japanese intro.

01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:45.920
I'm probably pretty sure next week I'm going to have the song, Real Emotion, on our pre-show.

01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:56.200
Yeah, so I got to see a little bit of 10-2 yesterday, and it's interesting. I really

01:38:56.200 --> 01:39:01.000
liked how there's... I mean, this is to be expected when you have a direct sequel to

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.240
a Final Fantasy game, but a lot of the same areas. Like, you know, I was watching the

01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:07.280
beginning of the game and there's a lot of Luca in it, and so it was kind of cool to

01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:10.760
see like the same areas but like with these new kind of characters and

01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:14.400
different things I don't know I'm easily amused I guess um but the gameplay

01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:19.560
overall like it looks like they kept the same engine for everything outside the

01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:23.420
battles and then totally redid the battle engine it's that all active

01:39:23.420 --> 01:39:26.920
battle yeah it's all actually really fast and they have the dress shoes and

01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:31.360
that's the first thing I noticed was my god the battles are fast paced Wow but

01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:34.820
it's pretty cool I like that I like the idea of some fast paced battles on a

01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:39.500
Final Fantasy game. The dresspheres are fine. But this is, yeah, between the dresspheres

01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:43.940
and the whole just blatant Charlie Angel's theme, Charlie's Angels theme going on with

01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:50.380
it, it is seriously, it's a cross between Final Fantasy and a Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen

01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:56.820
shopping game. No! Do not insult the game with that. And then, you know, you go to these

01:39:56.820 --> 01:40:01.540
towns, you're talking to people, it's like, you totally scored, like, 1,500 gills. You

01:40:01.540 --> 01:40:05.460
up in the chest and says, you scored Phoenix down, you know.

01:40:05.460 --> 01:40:11.380
And everything is awesomeness, awesome that. Oh my god, you were so awesome, you're throwing

01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:14.700
up a level, babe. That particular scene where they're talking

01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:18.780
about the awesome sphere. Girl, you know how to work that level.

01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:25.780
It's just like that in the Japanese version. But I did notice some changes, like in the

01:40:25.780 --> 01:40:32.180
I did notice some changes. There's, um, like, um, in the Japanese version, there's the Seagull

01:40:32.180 --> 01:40:36.780
team and there's the Gullwings in the US one. That's like a little, you know, little changes

01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:41.900
here and there. And then they got all the same voice actors.

01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:45.300
Yeah, that was pretty cool. Don't get me wrong, just because I say it's a cross between Mary

01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:49.380
Kay and Ashley Olsen game, I'm just, I'm poking fun at it. It really does look like a pretty

01:40:49.380 --> 01:40:52.780
neat game. I wish I could have, like, played it a little more, but I'm too consumed with

01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:55.860
11 to give a shit about any other Final Fantasy right now.

01:40:55.860 --> 01:41:00.140
Addict. So, Ragnarok is cooler. Ragnarok is cooler.

01:41:00.140 --> 01:41:10.140
Yeah, and I need to beat 10 first anyway, so. Yeah, Final Fantasy X-2, not too shabby.

01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:15.780
It's kind of what you'd expect. It's definitely kind of made for the fanboys, although I don't

01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:20.620
know, I would say it's a very great game. I should have brought it back with me.

01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:25.180
But it's more for teenage girls and gay men, but that's okay.

01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:28.140
Fanboys will love it too because, you know, I guess they're hot or whatever.

01:41:28.140 --> 01:41:29.780
It definitely gives the fan service.

01:41:29.780 --> 01:41:32.540
Yeah, it's definitely for the fans.

01:41:32.540 --> 01:41:35.660
That's good because they need to sell a lot of copies to make up for how much money they

01:41:35.660 --> 01:41:36.660
lost on the movie.

01:41:36.660 --> 01:41:41.700
Well, you know, I really, though, I really think that the different job changed just

01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:42.700
a little.

01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:50.580
They have, like, set animations, like when you change into the singer.

01:41:50.580 --> 01:41:55.540
She had the spotlight on her and the lights behind her and it dark, so it looks all dramatic.

01:41:55.540 --> 01:42:01.100
Like when you change into the thief, she hops across the moon, there's a moon in the background

01:42:01.100 --> 01:42:02.100
they hop across.

01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:09.020
When you change into the sword fighter, you see their reflection in the sword.

01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:12.820
And Yuna has Tidus' sword.

01:42:12.820 --> 01:42:13.820
That was really cool.

01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:14.820
Yeah, it's pretty neat.

01:42:14.820 --> 01:42:15.820
But it's pretty cool.

01:42:15.820 --> 01:42:18.620
It actually doesn't look like it ruins a whole lot.

01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:22.540
I still haven't beaten Final Fantasy X, and it hasn't really ruined a whole lot, really.

01:42:22.540 --> 01:42:27.740
I mean, you can kind of pick up something that must happen, but I'm kind of appreciative

01:42:27.740 --> 01:42:33.060
that they didn't wreck the whole storyline to X with 10-2, you know what I mean?

01:42:33.060 --> 01:42:34.860
Does that make sense at all?

01:42:34.860 --> 01:42:35.860
It makes sense.

01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:36.860
All right.

01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:39.620
What do you think, Loki?

01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:41.540
You got to see the game a little bit.

01:42:41.540 --> 01:42:42.540
He's running away.

01:42:42.540 --> 01:42:46.180
Have you got to play 10-2 at all, Zero?

01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:47.700
What did you think of what you saw?

01:42:47.700 --> 01:42:52.140
a little bit and what I saw, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it or not. It just

01:42:52.140 --> 01:42:55.860
looked kind of girly to me, but I saw a couple of battle scenes and I thought they looked

01:42:55.860 --> 01:43:00.700
really good, so I'm definitely going to be at some point picking it up. The strategy

01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:04.660
guide is really cool, especially with the limited edition one with all the artwork and

01:43:04.660 --> 01:43:09.660
stuff in it. Going by reading some of that strategy guide and seeing some of the stuff

01:43:09.660 --> 01:43:13.500
I saw and from what other people have been telling me, I think that I actually will like

01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:18.940
it because I really didn't like 10 too much because it just I don't know I just didn't

01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:23.500
really get with the story but it looks like this one with its more fast paced action I

01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:28.580
think I'll be able to keep up with it a lot more and enjoy it.

01:43:28.580 --> 01:43:33.600
It really does feel though like you're coming in at the end of 10 because it's like what

01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:38.880
you can do is already advanced in as far as where you can go and you get choices of different

01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:47.080
missions you can take and it's pretty I enjoy the game okay you guys want to

01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:51.880
know tonight's cage match winner all right let's unveil tonight's cage match

01:43:51.880 --> 01:44:01.200
winner back to the cage match I've tallied up all the votes and and we have

01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:06.960
a tie in tonight's cage match yay there's a tie in tonight's cage match

01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:12.340
between Loki's pick battle without a honor or humanity the 88 severed

01:44:12.340 --> 01:44:13.340
limbs mix

01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:22.860
and between the Utah Saints song

01:44:22.860 --> 01:44:28.740
whoops whoop that's not it

01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:31.260
it's this one sorry there it is

01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:46.040
So we have a tie, and in that case I get to break the tie, with a hammer. Sorry you can't

01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:57.900
send in house votes, I'm on to you. So I get to break the tie vote. Oh wow, this is tricky.

01:44:57.900 --> 01:45:02.860
There's a tie between the first and second songs tonight, and I get to break the tie.

01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:09.260
And whereas, I think I do prefer Battle Without a Honor or Humanity, I didn't quite care for

01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:13.260
what Loki had to say about my cage match pick, so I'm choosing Jamie's cage match pick.

01:45:13.260 --> 01:45:14.260
Yay!

01:45:14.260 --> 01:45:19.300
Oh no, now I have to make another song, oh no.

01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:26.300
I would like to vote that that goes into permanent rotation.

01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:35.300
Well, okay. Sure, why not, since we're all Kill Bill fans anyway.

01:45:35.300 --> 01:45:43.260
Alright, so there we go. So you'll hear both of those songs in Orange

01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:16.340
We're going to play that real emotion from Final Fantasy X-2 and something else in this

01:46:16.340 --> 01:46:17.340
break.

01:46:17.340 --> 01:46:19.820
Then when we come back, we'll do the FUs of the week.

01:46:19.820 --> 01:46:21.940
We'll have to skip forward though a little bit.

01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:22.940
So say this-

01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:25.660
But why would we play both versions?

01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:27.540
We have the Japanese shortened up one?

01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:30.460
Okay, so we'll play both versions then, I guess.

01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:34.060
So we're going to skip forward a little bit in this MP3, so pardon us while we navigate

01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:36.300
this MP3 a little bit to find you the actual words.

01:46:36.300 --> 01:46:40.920
So we'll hear both the English and Japanese versions of real emotion.

01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:43.680
And we'll be back with the FUs of the week, so send those in over private messages to

01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:50.680
the sky.

01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:18.680
What can I do for you?

01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:28.680
What can I do for you?

01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:30.680
But I can't get in you

01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:35.680
What can I do for you?

01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:46.680
I'll be the hazy girl of my heart I can't wait for something like this

01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:54.680
And now and then I don't know what to do I don't think that I can ever go back

01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:57.680
To the things I've seen And those hazy dreams

01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:00.680
Can you tell her what I'm sayin' now?

01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:01.680
Hey.

01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:03.680
You said it'd be a good thing,

01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:04.680
Like a thing,

01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:08.680
Like a thing.

01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:10.680
So, I know,

01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:13.680
The world up in the ocean has surrounded me.

01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:16.680
I won't get into it now.

01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:17.680
I know,

01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:21.680
That 40's the only way my heart can go.

01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:25.680
I hear your voice callin' out to me.

01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:28.080
You'll never be alone

01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:29.080
Can I get to you?

01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:32.680
Can I get to you?

01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:36.680
Can I get to you?

01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:40.180
Can I get to you?

01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:44.680
Yeah, I can hear you

01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:51.680
And if I find the river that the moment has surrounded me

01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:54.680
And I can't go on

01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:57.680
I'll dance the moment that I close my eyes

01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:00.180
I'll fall in love's happy heart

01:49:00.180 --> 01:49:03.180
I'm dancing for all of you

01:49:03.180 --> 01:49:05.180
I'll never be free

01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:07.180
And so I know

01:49:07.180 --> 01:49:10.180
The world of good emotion has to rise

01:49:10.180 --> 01:49:13.180
I won't give in to it now

01:49:13.180 --> 01:49:16.180
I know that moment is the only way

01:49:16.180 --> 01:49:18.180
My heart can go

01:49:18.180 --> 01:49:21.180
I hear your voice calling out

01:49:21.180 --> 01:49:25.180
I can't hear you, you'll never be alone

01:49:25.180 --> 01:49:30.180
Can I do for you? Can I do for you? Can I do for you?

01:49:30.180 --> 01:49:33.180
I can't hear you

01:49:33.180 --> 01:49:36.180
I can't hear you

01:49:36.180 --> 01:49:46.580
What can I do for you?

01:51:06.180 --> 01:51:16.180
This is the end of the video, if you want to see more videos like this, please subscribe to my channel.

01:51:46.180 --> 01:52:15.940
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff

01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:17.940
Do we want to be accepted by Hollywood?

01:52:17.940 --> 01:52:19.940
No!

01:52:19.940 --> 01:52:21.940
Do we care what people think of us?

01:52:21.940 --> 01:52:23.940
No!

01:52:23.940 --> 01:52:25.940
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

01:52:25.940 --> 01:52:27.940
Yes!

01:52:27.940 --> 01:52:31.940
Extreme Bimani Radio.

01:52:31.940 --> 01:52:33.940
That's us.

01:52:33.940 --> 01:52:35.940
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:52:35.940 --> 01:52:37.940
Hi everybody.

01:52:37.940 --> 01:52:39.940
We're back.

01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:41.940
Both versions of a real motion back to back there.

01:52:41.940 --> 01:52:46.940
and there's a third one out there too, Koda doing the English, but we don't have that currently.

01:52:46.940 --> 01:52:49.940
We'll just have to play that later! Yep.

01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:53.940
Anyway, it's about time to get into the FUs of the Week, but Jamie's not here just yet.

01:52:53.940 --> 01:53:00.940
So, Loki, is there anything going on out there in the sim world you want to tell us about?

01:53:00.940 --> 01:53:07.940
I guess. People are working on skins for, you know, the rest of the Bomani games like, you know, Extreme and stuff.

01:53:07.940 --> 01:53:16.980
I hear Popping Music's in development for StepMania. Support for that. And, let's see,

01:53:16.980 --> 01:53:23.580
what else? Oh, Keysound BMS files for 9th Style will be up on Vimeo later this week.

01:53:23.580 --> 01:53:29.220
They promised it a few days ago, but they ran into some problems or something. So, those

01:53:29.220 --> 01:53:33.500
will be up later on this week. So, you look for those. So, you can play 9th Style stuff

01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:42.520
at home without all the lag. Also on supernova.org they've got the hard drive images for some

01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:47.020
of the rest of the Beatmania games. Almost all of them are covered now. So if you have

01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:52.700
the latest version of MAME you can play those as well. So go get those if you want to play

01:53:52.700 --> 01:54:01.620
the actual arcade game of Beatmania. And yeah, there's other stuff but I can't mention the

01:54:01.620 --> 01:54:09.380
other stuff too. But that's more local anyways. So, that's it. Oh, and I'm sure people are

01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:14.460
going to be ripping Xbox stuff, but nothing yet. And as I mentioned last week, DDR Fever

01:54:14.460 --> 01:54:23.540
stuff is available on DDRamerica.org or whatever it is, I can't remember. It's a DDR BitTorrent

01:54:23.540 --> 01:54:29.420
site and you can download the craptastic songs that they have on there that's

01:54:29.420 --> 01:54:39.060
about it okay well let's see I think we're about ready to get into the FUs

01:54:39.060 --> 01:54:42.140
of the week so you want to send those over to me

01:54:42.140 --> 01:54:51.220
Sky private message and try to limit yourselves on the FUs of the week I'm

01:54:51.220 --> 01:54:54.820
getting several people who are writing me novels this week and forget it

01:54:54.820 --> 01:54:58.940
i'm capping you guys after like three or four f us because it's too much

01:54:58.940 --> 01:55:01.900
so um... and there's a lot of people sending them tonight so uh... send me

01:55:01.900 --> 01:55:03.180
your best ones

01:55:03.180 --> 01:55:05.160
uh... in the meantime

01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:07.320
jamie what is the f u segment all about

01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:14.320
when we're pissed off and tell everyone about it.

01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:30.400
Um, my first F.U. of the week goes for people who are consistently negative and have

01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:32.520
nothing positive to say.

01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:36.600
Like someone who, um, never mind, I'm not naming names,

01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:40.400
but someone who is uh... listening right now

01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:42.040
now i'm not mentioning names

01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:43.760
they know who they are

01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:45.720
because trust me who always says

01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:47.280
oh this sucks

01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:49.520
that's not my style or

01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:54.560
i don't like this or always negative always negative anyway

01:55:54.560 --> 01:55:56.100
um...

01:55:56.100 --> 01:55:58.760
and everyone goes through having to go back to work

01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:01.660
although honestly when i went back to work we were having a

01:56:01.660 --> 01:56:05.160
thanksgiving potluck it was pretty cool

01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:06.220
and uh...

01:56:06.220 --> 01:56:10.780
Of course, it's also no longer our busy season of the year, so we're really slow, so I've

01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:14.660
got tons of time just to get stuff done and think.

01:56:14.660 --> 01:56:23.660
Um, Effie goes to my cat for, uh, needing a bath, so I have to go wash my cat.

01:56:23.660 --> 01:56:24.660
Um.

01:56:24.660 --> 01:56:32.380
Oh, I just need to make sure that the pussy's clean.

01:56:32.380 --> 01:56:35.460
Well, at least she's well-petted.

01:56:35.460 --> 01:56:47.940
Anyway, another F.U. goes toward the upstairs room at my house for not being

01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:53.180
cleaned so I have to clean that and I don't want to do that.

01:56:53.180 --> 01:56:57.940
And then all the stupid people in California, which are most everybody.

01:56:57.940 --> 01:56:58.940
Not everybody.

01:56:58.940 --> 01:57:03.700
There's more people in this room I can say as an intelligent human being.

01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:10.660
just everybody else though sucks and none of them can drive

01:57:10.660 --> 01:57:17.580
and another one goes toward um... me for leaving my oregel at home because my tooth hurts

01:57:17.580 --> 01:57:20.540
and then um...

01:57:20.540 --> 01:57:24.140
I think that's about it. I'm really not full of angst today

01:57:24.140 --> 01:57:25.340
oh yeah

01:57:25.340 --> 01:57:26.300
ten-two

01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:27.680
ten

01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:28.940
ten

01:57:28.940 --> 01:57:33.340
not x

01:57:33.340 --> 01:57:35.980
oh yeah and the other one goes towards square

01:57:35.980 --> 01:57:39.780
for closing the final fantasy 11 beta

01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:43.100
right before i could install my beta copy

01:57:43.100 --> 01:57:46.880
square enix

01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:49.100
big f u to square enix

01:57:49.100 --> 01:57:50.860
and then

01:57:50.860 --> 01:57:58.520
a f u towards me not having more money

01:57:58.520 --> 01:57:59.900
uh...

01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:00.660
first one

01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:01.880
well it's kind of minor

01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:03.320
the first one was

01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:07.140
if you define fancy eleven because i was watering into a two more didn't know

01:58:07.140 --> 01:58:09.380
it's going to get jumped by two goblins

01:58:09.380 --> 01:58:12.880
you know there's a real life or a kick the goblins ass without thinking about

01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:13.560
it

01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:18.880
but this is a game so i can't do that i mean i'm a rpg haha no i'm not a file

01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:21.920
fancy i play file fancy i don't play

01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:23.760
on my head that you're playing on

01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:25.560
and online game

01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:28.960
it's half of an online game it's half i fancy

01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:31.400
and i'm only having had the rule

01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:32.800
i'm not

01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:35.680
you break half of it you break the whole thing

01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:38.240
you don't understand i'm playing it leisurely

01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:44.120
i'm not like i have to be on there all day cause i have to level up every day every day

01:58:44.120 --> 01:58:47.220
oh my god if i'm not in this world like

01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:49.000
most of my life

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:50.760
i don't know what i'm gonna do i dedicate

01:58:50.760 --> 01:58:55.280
i dedicate the nelson laugh to you

01:58:55.280 --> 01:58:58.000
uh... second f u goes to leaves

01:58:58.000 --> 01:58:59.480
i don't like leaves

01:58:59.480 --> 01:59:04.000
and the fact that every single leaf that's in this apartment complex

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:05.860
fell during one day

01:59:05.860 --> 01:59:09.360
it's like it's snow outside but it's leaves

01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:12.860
there's just like so many leaves out there it's kind of funny because the

01:59:12.860 --> 01:59:15.120
mexicans were here the day before

01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:19.920
blowing off the leaves like a few leaves that were there

01:59:19.920 --> 01:59:23.300
and then a few years later every single leaf falls all at once

01:59:23.300 --> 01:59:26.860
man i wish i could see their sad face when they come to work

01:59:26.860 --> 01:59:28.120
next week

01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:30.200
but i'll man

01:59:30.200 --> 01:59:32.580
uh... also

01:59:32.580 --> 01:59:34.840
uh... at the two

01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:36.560
uh...

01:59:36.560 --> 01:59:38.280
the parades that we had today

01:59:38.280 --> 01:59:39.880
that mean that had been

01:59:39.880 --> 01:59:41.640
yeah been

01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:44.480
that's art

01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:46.500
and

01:59:46.500 --> 01:59:50.360
i really are much of at the the people are like this

01:59:50.360 --> 01:59:52.920
they're talking about michael jackson and already

01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:54.220
no victim of

01:59:54.220 --> 01:59:56.200
no molesting his child

01:59:56.200 --> 02:00:01.200
Here's my opinion on it, and you're going to listen to it anyways because I'm making you.

02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:08.200
Basically, I think he's an easy target, and that they're just taking advantage of him because he's an easy target and a freak that sleeps with children.

02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:13.200
Now, while he may be a freak that sleeps with children, does it mean that he's groping them?

02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:19.200
So, you know, I just think he's just a freak, but I think he's innocent, and yet people are like,

02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:22.200
I wouldn't let my kid next to that chum, Lester.

02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:27.200
He's been convicted. He hasn't even gone to trial yet. You haven't heard any of the details yet.

02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:33.200
It's just, it's annoying. But, I hate the media, because now they're talking about this instead of Kobe Bryant.

02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:41.200
And then, you know, next thing you'll hear is, like, I don't know, uh, Bob Barker will have, like, chicken heads stapled to his walls.

02:00:41.200 --> 02:01:08.080
kostjamrh And you know, if something like that happened,

02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:12.320
Bob Barker would have a bunch of kittens and puppies killed all in his house, and then

02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:16.520
he's talking about spandex and pets.

02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:19.640
I just had a horrible thought, and Rod's probably going to hate me for this.

02:01:19.640 --> 02:01:25.120
He's probably got the preserved corpse of Rod Roddy in the closet, so that he can open

02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:30.160
it up. What would you do in this situation, Rod? What would you do?

02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:40.480
I would sell it on eBay. Anyways, um, yeah, I'm done. Oh, F you to, um, Iron Chef for

02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:45.360
not, like, last night we watched the, they tied, okay, so they had to go into an overcooked

02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:50.400
round, and, um, they had, the first round was the potato match, which was awesome, because

02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:53.960
I love potatoes, so I was watching that, and then the next round was sweet potatoes. I

02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:57.280
was like, you know what'd be cool? Is if they put something in there that, like, no one

02:01:57.280 --> 02:02:03.120
would want to cook, like kittens. They should have the kitten Iron Chef cook off. And it

02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:07.860
would be great because they'd just be like all grossed out and stuff, but they'd have

02:02:07.860 --> 02:02:13.900
to create awesome dishes using kittens. Live kittens. So that's it.

02:02:13.900 --> 02:02:18.100
I don't know. I still want to see the live octopus one. Like from the intro.

02:02:18.100 --> 02:02:22.460
Giant alien. No. All right, I'm done.

02:02:22.460 --> 02:02:23.700
Dog, force me.

02:02:23.700 --> 02:02:24.700
Rob.

02:02:24.700 --> 02:02:25.700
Rob.

02:02:25.700 --> 02:02:29.780
Well, you might try giving me a microphone. I'd love to give some F yous

02:02:31.300 --> 02:02:35.260
I have a couple of use this week F you to the power going out earlier today

02:02:35.260 --> 02:02:40.520
I fucking sucked and I thought I thought you know what though F you for not staying off longer

02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:41.620
I wish it was still off right now

02:02:41.620 --> 02:02:45.200
Then I would have had an excuse to just stay home and not do it

02:02:46.580 --> 02:02:50.380
Sure, I could have just gone over to Jamie's, but I would have taken the easy way

02:02:50.380 --> 02:02:52.380
I would have left me to do this by myself.

02:03:20.380 --> 02:03:24.620
on it got voted out, but the show itself is still good, and next season is going to be

02:03:24.620 --> 02:03:28.380
like the best television ever. So, um, you have to go to people that hate on reality

02:03:28.380 --> 02:03:30.780
TV just because reality TV, because this show rules.

02:03:30.780 --> 02:03:34.900
The only reason he's doing so well is all those two-year-olds watching the show. That

02:03:34.900 --> 02:03:41.060
and, um, you know, the other show. Anyways, yeah, that sucked! Fucking A that he got voted

02:03:41.060 --> 02:03:45.260
off, but, you know, that's alright, because, you know, vicariously through someone else,

02:03:45.260 --> 02:03:49.020
he will have his revenge. You know what, I kind of view, a lot of people hate on it,

02:04:19.020 --> 02:04:23.020
really hot guys like billy kidman he's hot

02:04:23.020 --> 02:04:27.100
wrestling's okay it's just you know it's not my cup of tea but i don't hate on

02:04:27.100 --> 02:04:29.900
wrestling just because wrestling is popular yet

02:04:29.900 --> 02:04:33.980
people hate on survivor because survivor is popular so i'm saying f you

02:04:33.980 --> 02:04:37.820
i don't watch wrestling because they don't wrestle against little kittens

02:04:37.820 --> 02:04:41.660
god damn it i want to see the big people smash the kittens

02:04:41.660 --> 02:04:47.500
is that so much to ask and to be honest i actually rather enjoy wrestling when

02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:50.860
China's involved, except she's gone now, so I'm going to be a singer now.

02:04:50.860 --> 02:04:54.140
And I like it when they get out the tables and the ladders.

02:04:54.140 --> 02:04:55.900
That's always entertaining.

02:04:55.900 --> 02:04:59.900
The teal and I like how the tables, ladders, ladders and chairs and cookie sheets.

02:05:00.700 --> 02:05:02.140
I liked them.

02:05:02.140 --> 02:05:05.700
I also liked how the one icon on Jamie's wrestling data

02:05:05.700 --> 02:05:07.940
for some game was a little spinning ladder.

02:05:07.940 --> 02:05:09.940
Yeah, on the news fight game.

02:05:09.940 --> 02:05:11.540
That was cool. A ladder.

02:05:11.540 --> 02:05:12.840
Yes, that rocked.

02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:15.740
Anyway, let's hear from other folks in our room.

02:05:15.740 --> 02:05:20.740
zer0, your FUs of the week

02:05:45.740 --> 02:05:50.740
kostjamrh FU to Mortal Kombat 5 should have stopped at 3

02:06:15.740 --> 02:06:20.740
kostjamrh But now they're doing Mortal Kombat 5 because they realized, oh, Deadly Alliance is kind of popular, maybe we should have put it in the arcade.

02:06:20.740 --> 02:06:25.740
kostjamrh Yeah, which is absolutely ridiculous, because they should have stopped at the failure of 4.

02:06:25.740 --> 02:06:30.740
kostjamrh Deadly Alliance was okay, I mean it was no Soul Calibur, but it was entertaining. It was more entertaining than a lot of fighting games I've played.

02:06:30.740 --> 02:06:35.740
kostjamrh Fatalities are still cool.

02:06:35.740 --> 02:06:40.740
kostjamrh Fatalities all sucked on Deadly Alliance.

02:06:40.740 --> 02:06:50.740
kostjamrh They didn't even put like friendships or anything in there, because those were the funniest out of everything.

02:06:50.740 --> 02:06:55.740
kostjamrh This is going to be great!

02:07:20.740 --> 02:07:27.740
pikachu mix

02:07:50.740 --> 02:07:58.740
Anyways, anyways, um, and the F-U-2 didn't have my right arm injured, in a way.

02:07:58.740 --> 02:08:01.740
I'll show the videos later.

02:08:01.740 --> 02:08:13.740
And, basically not many F-Us, except for people emailing me about the upcoming tournament I'm trying to organize for April, which I have no place at yet.

02:08:13.740 --> 02:08:17.740
People saying, when is it going to be coming over? It's coming soon.

02:08:17.740 --> 02:08:22.740
kostjamrh And people are issuing about bar raping vs no bar raping on PA

02:08:47.740 --> 02:08:56.740
All the Final Fantasy, etcetera, etcetera, and especially the new upcoming movie of Final Fantasy Children Advent.

02:08:56.740 --> 02:09:03.740
I already know, you know what, as much as I love Final Fantasy VII, I'm already convinced this movie is going to be a huge disappointment, so...

02:09:03.740 --> 02:09:05.740
I'm not looking forward to it.

02:09:05.740 --> 02:09:10.740
I've always seen, like, the spirits within, but all I do is throw fanboy shit, like,

02:09:10.740 --> 02:09:38.020
p0k3smot42o

02:09:40.740 --> 02:09:41.740
the week

02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:42.740
not really

02:09:42.740 --> 02:09:45.740
okay

02:09:45.740 --> 02:09:50.740
then lets get on to our chair of F.U. shall we

02:09:50.740 --> 02:09:53.740
Jamie would you like to enter an F.U. on behalf of Miko

02:09:53.740 --> 02:09:56.740
F.U. to not having an F.U.

02:09:56.740 --> 02:09:57.740
alright

02:09:57.740 --> 02:10:00.740
moving on

02:10:00.740 --> 02:10:03.740
what is up with this Mary Kay and Ashley DVD

02:10:03.740 --> 02:10:04.740
moving on

02:10:04.740 --> 02:10:08.740
Zodiac Knight would like to give an F.U. of the week to Squeenix

02:10:08.740 --> 02:10:14.040
An FU of the week to Squeenix for using a sucky version of Real Emotion as the X2 opening song.

02:10:14.040 --> 02:10:15.740
Okay, that version did not suck.

02:10:17.240 --> 02:10:18.440
DarkHatsui would like to say,

02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:20.740
F you to this cold that still hasn't gone away.

02:10:21.540 --> 02:10:22.940
Jason would like to say,

02:10:22.940 --> 02:10:25.940
F you to cable one while I'm happy that I can have cable.

02:10:25.940 --> 02:10:29.640
It's really stupid that me and my friend are separated by four houses and one street

02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:31.040
and that he can't get cable.

02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:31.940
Hurry the hell up.

02:10:32.540 --> 02:10:35.840
Uh, fuck you, boss, name withheld, for calling me fat.

02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:37.940
I haven't gained a pound in quite a while.

02:10:37.940 --> 02:10:43.580
Jason would also like to say fuck myself for not listening in a while and not having a reason not to listen

02:10:44.060 --> 02:10:46.420
Yes, I'm the permissible fired

02:10:48.300 --> 02:10:50.300
You have a microphone oh the other ferret

02:10:51.860 --> 02:10:53.860
Where the hell did it go?

02:10:54.140 --> 02:10:56.980
Well, then it's your fault for throwing it at me, isn't it? Oh

02:10:57.620 --> 02:10:59.140
Here it is

02:10:59.140 --> 02:11:03.480
Don't throw it again. All right. Yeah, if you Jason shame on you for not listening

02:11:08.240 --> 02:11:12.900
DJ dark knight would like to say f you to the game attendance at my local putt-putt

02:11:12.980 --> 02:11:16.720
We're not fixing the 2dx and initial d machines because the 2dx machines

02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:23.760
Still have the black void on the top of the screen and can't watch the videos and the initial d machine for not fixing the two

02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:27.540
Player side wheel because of that I lost a match racing Friday night

02:11:27.540 --> 02:11:31.540
Alright, here's a suggestion. Stop playing Initial D.

02:11:31.540 --> 02:11:35.540
Hey! Here's a suggestion. Get a JPS 2 and play it at home.

02:11:35.540 --> 02:11:39.540
Play Initial D at home like I do.

02:11:39.540 --> 02:11:43.540
Darkchild

02:11:43.540 --> 02:11:47.540
DD Archaholic, I don't know. I think it's Darkchild sending most of these FUs but they keep

02:11:47.540 --> 02:11:51.540
switching their name back and forth. Darkchild likes to say FU to people who call

02:11:51.540 --> 02:11:55.540
others stupid for saying things differently than they do. FU to

02:11:55.540 --> 02:11:59.180
people who act one way and bitch at others for doing it themselves. F U to the cat shit

02:11:59.180 --> 02:12:05.900
smell creeping in on me and F U to Polar Boy of Game Stop Arden, whatever that means. S

02:12:05.900 --> 02:12:11.180
Ghost would like to say, F U to my job for being bipolar. Last week they scheduled me

02:12:11.180 --> 02:12:17.500
less than 10 hours and this week they scheduled me 30 plus before schedule changes. My boss

02:12:17.500 --> 02:12:21.980
and his wife are morons, they should learn how to schedule before starting a business.

02:12:21.980 --> 02:12:25.980
F you to my dreams. I'm sick of being a secret service member for a bag of salad.

02:12:25.980 --> 02:12:27.980
What?

02:12:27.980 --> 02:12:31.980
I'm sick of being a secret service member for a bag of salad.

02:12:31.980 --> 02:12:33.980
Okay.

02:12:33.980 --> 02:12:37.980
Oddly enough I always die at the end. I think Freud would have a field day with me.

02:12:37.980 --> 02:12:42.980
F you to anyone who thinks I'm a pervert now. I was making a reference to an earlier statement like

02:12:42.980 --> 02:12:47.980
that tits equal veto power. I'm not sexist and I'm sorry if anyone thought I was.

02:12:47.980 --> 02:12:50.980
But, but, but, but they do.

02:12:50.980 --> 02:13:04.980
FU to my clothes washer having an electrical fire leaving my clothes soaking in water

02:13:04.980 --> 02:13:08.980
FU to this freaking wait for Phantasy Star Online Episode 3

02:13:08.980 --> 02:13:12.980
FU to everyone who can't time attack on Phantasy Star Online Challenge Mode

02:13:12.980 --> 02:13:15.980
I quit P.S.O.

02:13:42.980 --> 02:13:46.820
would like to say F you to people who accuse me of cheating on ultra mix it's

02:13:46.820 --> 02:13:55.420
not my fault that you can't be as great as an arrow-smashing fairy as I am from

02:13:55.420 --> 02:14:01.500
one arrow-smashing fairy to another you show them who's boss DJ Specter would

02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:05.660
like to say F you to my Spanish teacher F you to Sam's Club for not having the

02:14:05.660 --> 02:14:10.300
digital camera they supposedly had F you to school and F you to optical illusions

02:14:10.300 --> 02:14:16.300
and that's for minst would like to say fu to teen night at the ddr place by my house

02:14:16.300 --> 02:14:20.700
home from college for break and i forgot they did that on fridays the place was filled with

02:14:20.700 --> 02:14:26.220
various small children acting even more stupid than usual minst would also like to say fu

02:14:26.220 --> 02:14:29.900
to people who angst over initial d i've seen it for the first time and it's not a pretty

02:14:29.900 --> 02:14:36.520
sight oh yes an fu to being on dial-up for 10 days and fu to the people in the general

02:14:36.520 --> 02:14:42.240
area where I live, as for some reason they've decided it's now popular to golf, almost like

02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:43.240
five years ago.

02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:44.240
Anyway.

02:14:44.240 --> 02:14:45.240
That's like early 80s.

02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:46.240
I know.

02:14:46.240 --> 02:14:50.620
Angel would like to say, I can't give you my FU as much as I'd like to, but here we

02:14:50.620 --> 02:14:51.620
go.

02:14:51.620 --> 02:14:52.620
I don't, I don't.

02:14:52.620 --> 02:14:56.520
Oh, she's trying to omit names and stuff.

02:14:56.520 --> 02:15:00.600
FU to friends hanging out with enemies and expecting me to be cool with it.

02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:02.280
Stop trying to think that I'm friends with you still.

02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:03.280
I'm over it.

02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:38.280
I slept at around 4 a.m. and forced myself to wake up around 6 a.m. to take my cousin to school.

02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:43.280
F.U. to name-changing in some of the games and anime in general. I know there are some good name-changes,

02:15:43.280 --> 02:15:46.280
but they should at least be a good reason for it.

02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:51.280
Lastly, F.U. to the tourists who visit the Adventure Dome who break the Bomani machines and act like idiots.

02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:56.280
Okay, that's it.

02:15:56.280 --> 02:15:59.280
Oh, Miko thought of an F.U.

02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:19.280
kostjamrh I would have to say F U to the people who don't wear seatbelts, because Hailey, something from my school, just passed away because she did not wear a seatbelt.

02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:27.280
And she was driving in the pouring rain and speeding, without a seat belt.

02:16:27.280 --> 02:16:32.280
So she lost out of control and she crashed into some other cars.

02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:35.280
And she's dead.

02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:39.280
Well, that's Darwinism for you.

02:16:39.280 --> 02:16:40.280
What?

02:16:40.280 --> 02:16:41.280
Sorry.

02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:45.280
Well, hard lesson learned unfortunately, that's too bad.

02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:46.280
Wow.

02:16:46.280 --> 02:16:48.280
At least she wasn't drunk.

02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:53.280
At least she wasn't drunk and driving, because that's even worse if you ask me.

02:16:55.280 --> 02:16:58.280
You throw like a girl, Jonas! I'm just kidding.

02:16:58.280 --> 02:17:00.280
Okay, okay, I don't know.

02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:02.280
Right here.

02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:04.280
For somebody else, F you.

02:17:05.280 --> 02:17:06.280
Ah, blow me.

02:17:06.280 --> 02:17:07.280
Alright.

02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:08.280
Alright.

02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:09.280
Thanks.

02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:10.280
Wow.

02:17:10.280 --> 02:17:12.280
He does it again and the sun steps on the corner.

02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:14.280
I wish it was that easy.

02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:17.280
I wish I could just walk it up to some, you know, cute guy.

02:17:17.280 --> 02:17:24.280
me

02:17:47.280 --> 02:17:55.960
We are going to take a little breaky break here, and when we come back, we're going to

02:17:55.960 --> 02:18:01.120
play some more Ultramix, I think, and we're also going to do some Ask Orange Lounge. How's

02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:09.600
that sound, kids? Sound like fun? Yes, I thought so. All right, so we'll take a break, and

02:18:09.600 --> 02:18:15.040
we'll be right back. You can send those questions for Ask Orange Lounge now to me, Skye, in

02:18:15.040 --> 02:18:22.040
in the chatroom.

02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:54.040
Tell me that you want me Tell me that you need me

02:18:54.040 --> 02:19:02.040
Tell me that you want me Tell me that you love me

02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:09.040
I'll be your dream Be my fantasy

02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:17.040
I'll be your dream, you'll be my fantasy

02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:34.040
I'll be your dream, I'll be your dream

02:19:34.040 --> 02:19:39.040
I'll be your dream

02:19:39.040 --> 02:19:44.040
You'll be my fantasy

02:19:44.040 --> 02:19:47.040
Yeah

02:19:47.040 --> 02:19:50.040
Let the dream come true

02:19:50.040 --> 02:19:52.040
Let the dream come true

02:19:52.040 --> 02:19:56.040
Let the dream control your mind

02:19:56.040 --> 02:19:59.040
A little bit of ecstasy

02:23:26.040 --> 02:23:53.200
Hello, and welcome back everybody to Orange Launch Radio, Episode 70, our season 4 premiere.

02:23:53.200 --> 02:23:58.400
A few programming notes, things we need to tell you guys about, Vanilla Sky is going

02:23:58.400 --> 02:24:01.820
to be moving, it's not going to be on Monday nights anymore, it's going to be on Wednesday

02:24:01.820 --> 02:24:02.820
nights.

02:24:02.820 --> 02:24:06.340
Those of you who are listening to the show this week know that Lanky Style got a brand

02:24:06.340 --> 02:24:10.360
new job, which he started tonight, best of luck to him, but it's going to require that

02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:14.600
he is not available Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday nights, so instead we're going to move the

02:24:14.600 --> 02:24:19.800
show to Wednesday so he can still be a part of it, because they've been really good on

02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:24.940
show and we've talked about a lot of interesting game things and non game

02:24:24.940 --> 02:24:30.060
things so if you haven't tuned into that you should also back live this week on

02:24:30.060 --> 02:24:36.300

02:24:53.980 --> 02:24:56.980
Okay.

02:24:56.980 --> 02:25:01.140
Some of you may be asking yourselves, well, if Vanilla Sky is moving to Wednesdays, what's

02:25:01.140 --> 02:25:02.780
happening to Livewire?

02:25:02.780 --> 02:25:08.080
Well, I guess Loki would be best to answer that question, but I'll kind of answer it

02:25:08.080 --> 02:25:09.080
for him.

02:25:09.080 --> 02:25:11.780
He's going to be doing some intermittent stuff on Monday nights from now on.

02:25:11.780 --> 02:25:15.580
He doesn't really want to go through the effort to make a new Livewire every single week,

02:25:15.580 --> 02:25:18.160
because believe it or not, it's a lot of work.

02:25:18.160 --> 02:25:24.720
easier than just turn on the microphones and throw on some music like the rest of us do.

02:25:24.720 --> 02:25:31.080
So he's just going to do some stuff for Mondays intermittently and hopefully we'll still have

02:25:31.080 --> 02:25:35.080
some special programming for you guys on Monday night.

02:25:35.080 --> 02:25:37.200
Condition Zero will be back one of these days, won't it?

02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:39.440
I unlocked the new BLT one.

02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:41.400
Condition Zero will be back one of these days, won't it Zero?

02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:42.400
Yes?

02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:43.400
Yeah.

02:25:43.400 --> 02:25:44.400
Yes, yes, yes.

02:25:44.400 --> 02:25:45.400
All right, good.

02:25:45.400 --> 02:25:46.400
All right, as promised, let's go back over to UltraMix.

02:25:46.400 --> 02:25:47.400
mix.

02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:48.400
Alright, it's unlocked.

02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:55.400
They've just unlocked BLT style, so let's hear this, let's play, ooh this might be too

02:25:55.400 --> 02:25:58.400
loud, sorry guys.

02:25:58.400 --> 02:26:11.400
Well yeah, so it did on a fourth style.

02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:13.400
Alright, play it

02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:54.400
Of course, it sped up just like you would have thought it would.

02:26:54.400 --> 02:26:55.400
Huh?

02:26:55.400 --> 02:26:56.400
Yeah, a little bit.

02:26:56.400 --> 02:26:58.400
Yeah, a little bit.

02:26:58.400 --> 02:27:03.400
It's spelled out the same way that they're in 4th style.

02:27:28.400 --> 02:27:52.400
namagem1

02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:57.400
namagem1- I like this song a lot

02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:05.400
namagem1- I'm hoping they didn't fuck it up

02:28:02.400 --> 02:28:07.400
namagem1- I love the way it plays

02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:15.400
namagem1- I love that song

02:28:12.400 --> 02:28:17.400
namagem1- I'm hoping they didn't fuck it up

02:28:17.400 --> 02:28:22.400
justdrop- I'm hoping they didn't fuck it up, but apparently zero says they have

02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:57.400
dukeofthebump

02:29:22.400 --> 02:29:31.400
p0k3smot42o have you noticed any new katas?

02:29:31.400 --> 02:29:40.400
p0k3smot42o i think castle in the sky isnt a kata

02:29:40.400 --> 02:29:45.400
p0k3smot42o on doubles i know it is on singles i know it is

02:29:45.400 --> 02:29:52.400
kostjamrh What I don't like is that they rip the background from Fantasy from Max 2, the one by Lockout. It's a total rip-off of that background. Completely ripped off.

02:30:15.400 --> 02:30:22.400
And the background is a castle in the sky, go figure.

02:30:45.400 --> 02:31:04.960
I was expecting there to be a slow down there, but no.

02:31:04.960 --> 02:31:10.480
It slowed down marginally, it's still slowing down.

02:31:10.480 --> 02:31:11.480
Lots of freezes.

02:31:11.480 --> 02:31:16.480
no it's a consistent tempo change like with insertion

02:31:27.480 --> 02:31:32.480
yeah you usually don't see 16th note runs like that in licensed ones

02:31:32.480 --> 02:31:34.480
Yeah, there's been quite a few in this.

02:31:34.480 --> 02:31:53.840
some strange gallops there

02:31:53.840 --> 02:32:16.040
And some folks wanted to hear the Metal Gear one, so we'll play that too.

02:32:16.040 --> 02:32:24.040
We are playing a DDR Ultra MX-8 on Orange Pond's radio.

02:32:24.040 --> 02:32:31.040
Oh, this isn't the one I was thinking it was.

02:32:31.040 --> 02:32:32.040
This is the one that was...

02:32:32.040 --> 02:32:39.040
the one from 6 and Core, home version

02:33:02.040 --> 02:33:09.040
I'm kind of surprised this is only a 7, it's a little more 8-ish.

02:33:32.040 --> 02:33:34.040
to me, especially with the 16th in it. Oh, it is an 8?

02:33:34.040 --> 02:33:36.040
This doesn't look that hard at all.

02:33:36.040 --> 02:33:38.040
I'm sorry, this looks more like a 6.

02:33:38.040 --> 02:33:40.040
It doesn't look hard to us.

02:33:40.040 --> 02:33:42.040
We're kind of jaded because we've beaten, you know,

02:33:42.040 --> 02:33:44.040
Cat and stuff, but usually songs,

02:33:44.040 --> 02:33:46.040
once they get 16th notes in them and stuff,

02:33:46.040 --> 02:33:48.040
they're 8.

02:33:48.040 --> 02:33:50.040
So that's all that surprises me.

02:33:50.040 --> 02:33:52.040
I would honestly rank this song a 7.

02:33:56.040 --> 02:33:58.040
But if they're opposing, they're easy to do.

02:33:58.040 --> 02:34:00.040
If it's just

02:34:00.040 --> 02:34:03.040
The same step being repeated, it's easy.

02:34:30.040 --> 02:34:36.040
The only song that has a music video to it is the one with the half naked men in it.

02:34:36.040 --> 02:34:39.040
The Maasai one, do that thing.

02:34:39.040 --> 02:34:43.040
That was the only one.

02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:49.040
So is that it for Ultramix? Do you guys want to play one more or what?

02:34:49.040 --> 02:34:52.040
Okay, I'm going to do Keep Your Body Movin' by Spaghetti.

02:34:52.040 --> 02:34:54.040
Yeah, I played that one.

02:34:54.040 --> 02:34:58.040
Oh yeah, yeah, you did that one. We're going to do the There For You.

02:34:58.040 --> 02:35:22.800
p0k3smot42o

02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:28.080
It starts getting all jittery and crap, and it's like it's trying to load everything up

02:35:28.080 --> 02:35:31.700
Which it's the Xbox and it should be able to do it, but I'm really slow at songs

02:35:31.700 --> 02:35:34.480
It's almost like it starts the arrow starts shaking

02:35:34.480 --> 02:35:39.480
It has the solo dogs.

02:35:39.480 --> 02:35:44.480
You know what? I don't like free zeroes. I don't like free zeroes.

02:35:44.480 --> 02:35:49.480
Free zeroes are good when used in moderation.

02:35:49.480 --> 02:35:54.480
Yeah, there are too many

02:35:54.480 --> 02:35:59.480
thejadedmieu 3 zeroes are good when used in moderation

02:35:59.480 --> 02:36:04.480
kostjamrh Yeah, the too many ones were just excessive on the free zeroes. And the thing is, I don't play with free zeroes anyway because of my ankle.

02:36:04.480 --> 02:36:08.480
Too many ones were just excessive on the free zeroes.

02:36:08.480 --> 02:36:12.480
And the thing is, I don't play with free zeroes anyway because of my angle.

02:36:12.480 --> 02:36:16.480
Anytime I'm there, I'll be there with you

02:36:19.480 --> 02:36:23.480
Anytime I do what we do

02:36:23.480 --> 02:36:28.480
Anytime we do what we do

02:36:29.480 --> 02:36:31.480
Anytime, anytime

02:36:31.480 --> 02:36:50.920
Weee, that was fun. That song did not excite me. That song was very familiar. No, it's

02:36:50.920 --> 02:37:04.400
want to eat you up. Alright. No, I'm thinking the 2DX video because for the run for let's

02:37:04.400 --> 02:37:10.000
talk it over. I'm going to, I'm going to fade out UltraMix there and we're going to take

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:13.160
a quick break and when we come back we're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge and then

02:37:13.160 --> 02:37:20.920
wrap up the show, okay guys? So we will be right back, everybody. I'm just going to cue

02:37:20.920 --> 02:37:22.920
up some music. Jamie, what did you want to hear this break?

02:37:22.920 --> 02:37:27.920
The old Metal Gear one. The old Metal Gear one. So we will hear that

02:37:27.920 --> 02:37:34.920
right now. We'll be back. Thanks for tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:38:27.920 --> 02:38:44.920
Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Can you hear what I'm saying?

02:38:44.920 --> 02:38:47.920
I'm gonna jam the chicken man, they'll watch it back

02:38:47.920 --> 02:38:50.920
I'm gonna kill ass, beat him, kill him all

02:38:50.920 --> 02:38:59.920
Down, what am I gonna do?

02:38:59.920 --> 02:39:03.920
Have you ever seen a cool game like this?

02:39:03.920 --> 02:39:05.920
Here

02:39:33.920 --> 02:39:38.920
And why? Leave me alone so many days

02:39:38.920 --> 02:39:41.920
Just to get up in so many nights

02:39:41.920 --> 02:39:47.920
Leave me alone and run, run, run

02:39:47.920 --> 02:39:49.920
Tell me why

02:39:54.920 --> 02:39:56.920
Tell me why

02:40:56.920 --> 02:41:16.920
If you feel my heart, but you feel this is mine And it means you better stay behind, my love

02:41:16.920 --> 02:41:22.920
It's the dance of your soul, that you try to relieve You'll never undo your heart emotion

02:41:22.920 --> 02:41:24.920
Feel it, feel it, baby

02:41:24.920 --> 02:41:28.920
Feel the fire, it's burning deep inside me

02:41:28.920 --> 02:41:32.920
Listen, listen, honey, listen to

Come listen to you

02:41:56.920 --> 02:41:58.920
You can follow that and you'll find it fun

02:42:11.920 --> 02:42:13.920
Dance to the heartbeat

02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:41.160
We're going to MP3 Pro soon, probably over Thanksgiving, so don't be surprised if you

02:42:41.160 --> 02:42:46.380
hear a lot about how we've gone mp3 pro that means all that means is that if you

02:42:46.380 --> 02:42:51.440
have a special codec installed on your mp3 player that you will be able to hear

02:42:51.440 --> 02:42:57.200
DSL quality streaming at a dial-up standard so on the bitrate for the

02:42:57.200 --> 02:42:59.960
station will go up a little bit but it'll still be modem friendly for those

02:42:59.960 --> 02:43:06.520
who on thirty three six and fifty what is it fifty six K thirty five okay you'll

02:43:06.520 --> 02:43:14.960
will be fine. If you're on 28.8 though, fucking A. Upgrade. Fuck. Ten bucks for a 56k modem.

02:43:14.960 --> 02:43:22.840
I will buy you a modem. If you are seriously on 28.8 still, fucking email us at orangeloungeradioatyahoo.com

02:43:22.840 --> 02:43:26.920
so we may mock you openly. It'll take them an hour to email us, Rob. Yeah, it'll take

02:43:26.920 --> 02:43:31.000
them an hour to email us. But if you're on 33.6 or 56k, you'll still be fine. But the

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:38.000
bit rate will be up a little bit.

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:08.060
I sure don't think so as long as Jamie's around she's gonna dry me nuts of that fucking ferret until I set it on fire

02:44:09.440 --> 02:44:11.440
All right

02:44:12.240 --> 02:44:15.360
Question number one tonight from zodiac night

02:44:16.940 --> 02:44:24.580
What bimani songs of those that were never released on any DDR mix before so what bimani songs not on a DDR mix yet

02:44:24.580 --> 02:44:29.580
Would you guys and gals like to see come out in future downloads for Ultrix?

02:44:54.580 --> 02:44:59.280
speaking of official though the safari

02:44:59.280 --> 02:45:03.440
um... for me all the other tax songs that weren't released um...

02:45:03.440 --> 02:45:04.120
powered

02:45:04.120 --> 02:45:08.020
bad bye baby balloon is already in ddr he asks for ones that are already in ddr

02:45:08.020 --> 02:45:10.660
amigo

02:45:10.660 --> 02:45:13.900
okay so you want bad bye baby balloon as an ultramix download but

02:45:13.900 --> 02:45:16.940
but um... we're talking songs that haven't already been in ddr that are in

02:45:16.940 --> 02:45:19.280
some abamani game that's the deal

02:45:19.280 --> 02:45:20.780
there you go

02:45:20.780 --> 02:45:23.060
yeah like star mine there's one

02:45:23.060 --> 02:45:24.060
Instant Love.

02:45:24.060 --> 02:45:25.060
Okay.

02:45:25.060 --> 02:45:29.060
My pick would be Power Dream, from 9th Style, because I fucking love that song.

02:45:29.060 --> 02:45:35.260
Or just about anything in Kiryamoka, please, Bitmania, Love Me Do, would be fucking the

02:45:35.260 --> 02:45:36.260
shit.

02:45:36.260 --> 02:45:41.100
Showa, the 9th Style, the other 9th Style one that's not Lion Suki, but Lion Suki would

02:45:41.100 --> 02:45:42.100
be good too.

02:45:42.100 --> 02:45:43.100
So just about anything in Kiryamoka.

02:45:43.100 --> 02:45:44.100
No.

02:45:44.100 --> 02:45:45.100
Panorama.

02:45:45.100 --> 02:45:47.980
Or Goonies Are Good Enough, from Popin' 10, please.

02:45:47.980 --> 02:45:48.980
Thank you.

02:45:48.980 --> 02:45:49.980
Panorama.

02:45:49.980 --> 02:45:50.980
Yes.

02:45:50.980 --> 02:45:54.980
Anybody else have a thought for Bomani Songs for Ultramix Download?

02:45:55.980 --> 02:46:03.980
I think it would be cool to either see Traces, either the original or the remix, or to see...

02:46:04.980 --> 02:46:08.980
I can't think of it right now. Crap, I went blank.

02:46:08.980 --> 02:46:10.980
But it would be cool to see a good QQQ.

02:46:10.980 --> 02:46:13.980
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, Rizlim. Rizlim, please. Rizlim.

02:46:13.980 --> 02:46:21.980
Okay. Wouldn't it be cool if we knew someone that could make an upgrade for an arcade cabinet

02:46:21.980 --> 02:46:25.980
and they could put all these songs in there?

02:46:25.980 --> 02:46:30.980
That would be cool. Yeah, that would be fucking great. Let Xplosive answer the question.

02:46:30.980 --> 02:46:37.900
Let's see, what songs for the Bebop? Let me see, like, there's some songs from dusinfos.com

02:46:37.900 --> 02:46:44.660
that seem good, like the V-Techno remix, or the Abyss, the Heavens mix. That would sound

02:46:44.660 --> 02:46:45.660
good.

02:46:45.660 --> 02:46:51.540
Cool. I like 23rd Magus's idea, you should too, Jamie. Schlagwerk.

02:46:51.540 --> 02:46:52.540
Oh, Schlagwerk.

02:46:52.540 --> 02:46:59.620
How about Schlagwerk? You know what? Fuck 2DX, let's put some Loki remixes in a DDR

02:46:59.620 --> 02:47:04.900

02:47:26.420 --> 02:47:33.420
Question for me, how long is it really limp and fully extended?

02:47:36.960 --> 02:47:43.460
Ozzero is going to answer this, I don't know how he knows the answer but he wants to answer

02:47:43.460 --> 02:47:44.080
this.

02:47:44.080 --> 02:47:48.660
Well if I bend at the elbow it's about a foot long.

02:47:48.660 --> 02:47:51.540
God damn it, you stole my joke.

02:47:51.540 --> 02:47:53.540
If I put my arm straight out, it's about...

02:47:53.540 --> 02:47:55.160
I would say kind of limp.

02:47:55.160 --> 02:47:59.860
My finger is about two and a half inches, and when I fully extend that middle finger,

02:47:59.860 --> 02:48:04.820
as I'm doing right now, when I fully extend that middle finger, I think I'm hitting a

02:48:04.820 --> 02:48:06.180
good three inches there.

02:48:06.180 --> 02:48:14.140
It's not about the size of the boat, it's about the motion in the ocean.

02:48:14.140 --> 02:48:17.620
It's as big as you can airbrush it.

02:48:17.620 --> 02:48:23.300
John Fields would like to know, will you please play my remix of Air for everyone to hear?

02:48:23.300 --> 02:48:25.980
No.

02:48:25.980 --> 02:48:28.300
Maybe in the after birth.

02:48:28.300 --> 02:48:31.980
S Ghost would like to know, do you know why all the release dates for Ultramix are screwed

02:48:31.980 --> 02:48:33.080
up?

02:48:33.080 --> 02:48:34.980
I didn't know they were screwed up, I thought the game...

02:48:34.980 --> 02:48:36.820
Let's say thank you to Microsoft.

02:48:36.820 --> 02:48:41.780
Let's ask the guy that works at GameStop.

02:48:41.780 --> 02:48:42.780
I believe you.

02:48:42.780 --> 02:48:43.780
I'm sorry.

02:48:43.780 --> 02:48:47.180
No, it's actually not that the release dates were messed up.

02:48:47.180 --> 02:48:52.580
Since they, at the last minute, announced, basically about four days before they decided

02:48:52.580 --> 02:48:57.220
to do it, that instead of being out on December 3rd, it was actually going to be out with

02:48:57.220 --> 02:49:02.300
the pad and the game packaged, it was going to be out on the 18th. It was kind of something

02:49:02.300 --> 02:49:08.740
they didn't really push out. And then, as far as I know, check it, December 3rd has

02:49:08.740 --> 02:49:10.260
always been

02:49:10.260 --> 02:49:16.760
the original release date

02:49:16.760 --> 02:49:20.820
I'm getting yelled at for not answering that limp question honestly

02:49:20.820 --> 02:49:22.200
uh...

02:49:22.200 --> 02:49:24.620
let's see micro flaccid

02:49:24.620 --> 02:49:28.700
Nince would like to know, this is a good question being asked by Nince here

02:49:28.700 --> 02:49:33.540
why oh why are Magus's jokes so horribly bad?

02:49:33.540 --> 02:49:35.720
okay

02:49:35.720 --> 02:49:40.040
look at the originator of the jokes

02:49:40.040 --> 02:49:42.520
and the amount of the true sense of humor

02:49:42.520 --> 02:49:43.720
you're so mean

02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:47.880
i know i am that's why i'm here

02:49:47.880 --> 02:49:51.440
it's just like you have to understand your place in this world i wasn't meant

02:49:51.440 --> 02:49:52.600
to sing

02:49:52.600 --> 02:49:54.320
so i try not to

02:49:54.320 --> 02:49:59.620
he wasn't meant to be funny so he should try not to

02:49:59.620 --> 02:50:02.840
see it's really cool you gotta look at it this way

02:50:02.840 --> 02:50:07.000
his jokes are so bad because he takes all that power from his freestyling

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.200
and he puts it into his jokes

02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:11.600
and it just makes him so bad

02:50:11.600 --> 02:50:17.240
that i mean you know you can't help but say how horrible they are

02:50:17.240 --> 02:50:20.720
speaking of freestyling, imagine how he's gonna

02:50:20.720 --> 02:50:26.720
i wonder what the judge is gonna say if he even participates in the tournaments

02:50:26.720 --> 02:50:30.120
go ahead jonas

02:50:30.120 --> 02:50:31.960
that's all i gotta say

02:50:31.960 --> 02:50:33.960
i guess no comment

02:50:33.960 --> 02:50:38.960
you're saying fuck you to jamie when i'm the one who just totally like

02:50:38.960 --> 02:50:42.960
buffer there are thirty second don't forget there are about a minute

02:50:42.960 --> 02:50:44.320
i was gonna say you know

02:50:44.320 --> 02:50:46.080
alright

02:50:46.080 --> 02:50:49.440
uh... but you know what in all seriousness he's a good sport for putting up with our

02:50:49.440 --> 02:50:51.640
shit cause we're really fucking mean to him

02:50:51.640 --> 02:50:57.400
uh... i swear just translated into portuguese and he'll be hilarious

02:50:57.400 --> 02:51:02.840
Even funnier if you choose to read it.

02:51:02.840 --> 02:51:05.240
Okay.

02:51:05.240 --> 02:51:07.120
Moving on. Shit happens.

02:51:07.120 --> 02:51:10.240
Twenty-third of the night goes to everyone.

02:51:10.240 --> 02:51:16.040
Yeah, shit happens, but eventually you flash.

02:51:16.040 --> 02:51:21.440
DarkTetsuya would like to know, did Jamie ever get to hear QQQAZAR, and if so,

02:51:21.440 --> 02:51:23.180
what were her thoughts on it?

02:51:23.180 --> 02:51:27.380
There's two versions. There's the one that Angel did and there's the one that Loki did.

02:51:27.380 --> 02:51:30.160
So there's two versions and she's heard neither one.

02:51:30.160 --> 02:51:32.360
No that I ever have, yeah.

02:51:32.360 --> 02:51:36.280
So, maybe we'll send them to her later.

02:51:36.280 --> 02:51:40.040
Let's see...

02:51:40.040 --> 02:51:41.880
DJ Dark Knight.

02:51:41.880 --> 02:51:45.720
Oh, he has DJ in his name. He must be a 2DX player.

02:51:45.720 --> 02:51:47.840
Just messin', just messin'.

02:51:47.840 --> 02:51:50.800
I don't like that shit. I don't like people to try to tell other people what they should, what the

02:51:50.800 --> 02:51:57.800
can and can't put in your name. Can I want to be DJ whatever, go fucking for it. DJ

02:51:59.080 --> 02:52:03.080
can stand for a lot of things, it could be somebody's name. I fucking hate it when people

02:52:03.080 --> 02:52:09.520
F you of the week, I hope you're listening, pool boy, if somebody likes to rip on somebody

02:52:09.520 --> 02:52:14.000
else for using DJ in their name, fuck you, you have no right to tell anybody what they

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:19.640
can and can't put in their name just because they're not a real DJ. God, that pisses me

02:52:49.640 --> 02:52:53.040
right so we're radio DJs exactly exactly so we have every right to call ourselves

02:52:53.040 --> 02:52:59.160
DJ and my DJ Celica is actually from 2dx I don't want to be a DJ I didn't like

02:52:59.160 --> 02:53:14.160
her in full house okay well yeah he did have a question oh I heard rumors that

02:53:14.160 --> 02:53:18.400
Sony was going to do a karaoke revolution game themselves I saw it on a

02:53:18.400 --> 02:53:23.400
website. Is that true? Meaning that Sony was making a karaoke revolution type game themselves.

02:53:23.400 --> 02:53:30.160
Well, we did report it on Vanilla Sky earlier this week that Sony has asked the folks behind

02:53:30.160 --> 02:53:34.140
the iToy, because the iToy has done so well, to look into the possibilities of doing something

02:53:34.140 --> 02:53:41.120
karaoke related. And I remember some third party company was doing something too. Namtai

02:53:41.120 --> 02:53:44.760
was that it? Oh no, Namtai does the camera, but there was another company that's looking

02:53:44.760 --> 02:53:46.760
into doing the karaoke thing too.

02:53:46.760 --> 02:53:47.760
So, and...

02:53:47.760 --> 02:53:48.760
Ah!

02:53:48.760 --> 02:53:49.760
Stop!

02:53:49.760 --> 02:53:50.760
Ah!

02:53:50.760 --> 02:53:51.760
Will I kill you?

02:53:51.760 --> 02:53:52.760
Stop throwing the goddamn mic at me!

02:53:52.760 --> 02:53:57.120
Fuck, if it's not, like, sitting at the goddamn chair of the mic, like, wrapping around me

02:53:57.120 --> 02:54:02.760
like some sort of cobra snake or like some sort of fucking snake, like anaconda or something

02:54:02.760 --> 02:54:07.080
trying to wrap around me, it's like sitting on the floor just, this goddamn microphone

02:54:07.080 --> 02:54:08.080
is trying to kill me.

02:54:08.080 --> 02:54:09.080
Did you have your foot wrapped around your foot?

02:54:09.080 --> 02:54:10.080
I don't care!

02:54:10.080 --> 02:54:11.080
How's it going under my foot?

02:54:11.080 --> 02:54:12.080
I swear!

02:54:12.080 --> 02:54:18.240
going under my foot? I swear! Oh, I have to address this in the chatroom, Bill. They're

02:54:18.240 --> 02:54:25.320
saying that they have the right to call themselves BJ. Then go do it! Anyways, no, um, you don't

02:54:25.320 --> 02:54:29.720
happen to remember that one karaoke game I showed you at the store. I do remember that.

02:54:29.720 --> 02:54:33.640
The one with the ugly box. Yeah, the one we put at the very back of the store, hopefully

02:54:33.640 --> 02:54:39.360
nobody would see. Yeah, piece of shit. That's what, what the fuck would I play that shit

02:54:39.360 --> 02:54:46.360
The only cool thing is that it comes with three discs of karaoke music and nothing else because it's shit.

02:54:46.360 --> 02:54:51.360
No, you threw it too low.

02:54:51.360 --> 02:54:56.360
You know what, though, I hope no one buys that because you know what's going to happen.

02:54:56.360 --> 02:55:01.360
When one person buys it, they'll send your store 20 copies.

02:55:01.360 --> 02:55:06.360
Alright, well maybe I ought to go in and buy it then, just to see.

02:55:06.360 --> 02:55:11.360
You know what, I'm thinking of, one of the things I'm thinking of doing is actually getting

02:55:11.360 --> 02:55:14.800
the PC version of Pump It Up.

02:55:14.800 --> 02:55:19.160
To get the new one with all the newer songs on it, though.

02:55:19.160 --> 02:55:25.160
So I can play it in my no room upstairs at Premiere.

02:55:25.160 --> 02:55:26.160
I love Pump It Up.

02:55:26.160 --> 02:55:28.560
We'll have more news on that as we know it, but Namtai's working on something.

02:55:28.560 --> 02:55:33.060
They're also doing a dance game for the iToys, so they're ripping off Konami's ideas left

02:55:33.060 --> 02:55:36.240
and right, so we'll see what happens.

02:55:36.240 --> 02:55:41.800
has a question. When is Rob on Final Fantasy XI? You can find me on the Bismarck server

02:55:41.800 --> 02:55:48.840
on Final Fantasy XI, usually in the evenings. Loki has a smartass answer I'm sure. All the

02:55:48.840 --> 02:55:54.120
time? I was just going to say I was on there too. Since he says I have a smartass answer,

02:55:54.120 --> 02:55:59.200
yeah he's always on there because he doesn't have a life. He just plays Final Fantasy XI

02:55:59.200 --> 02:56:03.880
all the time. And sleeps. I'm on there too. I'm Tomosuke. He'll see me butchering rabbits

02:56:03.880 --> 02:56:08.840
left and right, because that's what I do. I butcher small, innocent animals. Since there's

02:56:08.840 --> 02:56:11.680
no kittens in the game, rabbits will have to suffice.

02:56:11.680 --> 02:56:16.240
Okay. You know what? I don't know that I can play that game, because I got motion sick

02:56:16.240 --> 02:56:26.520
watching Rob. Just play it blindfolded. Blink, blink. Alright. Play more Ragnarok. Alright.

02:56:26.520 --> 02:56:32.360
You can play on the Ragnarok server, if only on C11. No. I'll play Ragnarok, thank you.

02:56:32.360 --> 02:56:37.800
Okay, almost done, no more questions please, we have to wrap up this segment.

02:56:37.800 --> 02:56:42.100
Jazz would also like to know, and why don't you listen to me and check out Graduizik Cyber

02:56:42.100 --> 02:56:51.840
on Doubles Wii, because it says brand new 10-footers, especially on American Mix, should

02:56:51.840 --> 02:56:54.780
get talked about.

02:56:54.780 --> 02:57:01.100
It's a new 10-footer on Doubles, hooray, 10-footer, it would be nice if Wii was easier to play

02:57:01.100 --> 02:57:10.060
doubles at home oh my god that's the first otaku no video reference I've seen

02:57:10.060 --> 02:57:19.180
in like 20 like forever um Jason would like to ask why is it that when I have

02:57:19.180 --> 02:57:22.900
orange lounge radio turned up high and Papa music 8 turned up just enough to

02:57:22.900 --> 02:57:27.860
hear it that I can do so much better on songs than when Papa music 8 is blaring

02:57:27.860 --> 02:57:31.260
and, of course, the only music sound being made.

02:57:31.260 --> 02:57:35.820
So why is it when Orange Lounge Radio is on, he does even better?

02:57:35.820 --> 02:57:36.820
Any thoughts?

02:57:36.820 --> 02:57:38.020
I don't think that that made sense.

02:57:38.020 --> 02:57:44.660
Because our enchanted voodoo powers make it possible.

02:57:44.660 --> 02:57:49.320
Because we're great, end of story.

02:57:49.320 --> 02:57:51.860
And Darkchild would like to know, how long is my penis?

02:57:51.860 --> 02:57:55.860
But unfortunately, we're out of time, so we'll have to table that question next week.

02:57:55.860 --> 02:57:57.100
Sorry, gang.

02:57:57.100 --> 02:58:02.100
p0k3smot42o

02:58:27.100 --> 02:58:36.100
Moving on, who's next? Jonas, any final thoughts?

02:58:36.100 --> 02:58:46.100
Hmm, not really that much thought about it. Really not much. Except the fact that I've

02:58:46.100 --> 02:58:50.100
got 23rd Magus thinking about the next tournament and what he's going to do.

02:58:50.100 --> 02:58:53.100
Dude, Darkchild, you know I'm joking. Shut up.

02:59:53.100 --> 03:00:17.380
I have a word of advice for those folks making 10 foot edits to max remixes and things like

03:00:17.380 --> 03:00:18.380
that.

03:00:18.380 --> 03:00:19.380
Go outside!

03:00:19.380 --> 03:00:20.380
Seriously.

03:00:20.380 --> 03:00:22.180
Go outside and take in some fresh air.

03:00:22.180 --> 03:00:26.420
Please, make some friends, get a girlfriend, get laid, do you some good.

03:00:26.420 --> 03:00:27.420
All right.

03:00:27.420 --> 03:00:34.700
Tonight's final word, I'm going to give tonight's final word of the show to Mikko.

03:00:34.700 --> 03:00:40.980
So one word, one word that sums everything up for you, Mikko, right now.

03:00:40.980 --> 03:00:42.420
A one-letter word?

03:00:42.420 --> 03:00:44.180
Just one word, no, one word.

03:00:44.180 --> 03:00:45.180
One word.

03:00:45.180 --> 03:00:46.180
Bye.

03:00:46.180 --> 03:00:54.980

What is Ace Mista?

What is that? I don't know what Ace Mista is. Why do you know Ace Mista?

03:02:03.740 --> 03:02:09.740

You know, you have to have an ace in moderation, you know what I mean?

03:02:46.740 --> 03:02:49.740
You cannot have an ace all the time, you know?

03:02:49.740 --> 03:02:58.740
Because if you have an ass all the time, then it's not special.

03:02:58.740 --> 03:03:11.740
You know what mommy is saying? There is a boy and his name is Paul. And mommy like Paul.

03:03:11.740 --> 03:03:16.740
He's a nice boy but he's gay and he only like to sing.

03:03:16.740 --> 03:03:20.740
You know, he like an ass and Judy Garland, and that's all.

03:03:25.740 --> 03:03:28.740
And what kind of life is it like that?

03:03:29.740 --> 03:03:31.740
That's all.

03:03:32.740 --> 03:03:36.740
You know, there's an ass and an ass over the rainbow, and that's all.

03:03:37.740 --> 03:03:38.740
What kind of life?

03:03:39.740 --> 03:03:41.740
I don't know why they do this.

03:03:41.740 --> 03:03:48.220
I have to look at this book, it's an ace mister.

03:03:48.220 --> 03:03:50.860
SambPsar is going to look at this book.

03:03:50.860 --> 03:03:53.180
I am going to look at it.

03:03:53.180 --> 03:03:56.080
Look at mami, I am going to look at ace mister now.

03:03:56.080 --> 03:04:01.080
Look at mami, okay, look at mami.

03:04:01.080 --> 03:04:02.500
Ace mister.

03:04:02.500 --> 03:04:27.500
I was shocked, you know. I was so shocked. It was just ass right away, you know.

03:04:27.500 --> 03:04:45.860
I thought they would be table of contents, didn't they?

03:04:45.860 --> 03:04:57.020
Thank you very much everybody.

03:04:57.020 --> 03:05:24.020
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:05:24.020 --> 03:05:29.340
Welcome everybody to the Orange Lounge Radio after birth for the parts that were too hot

03:05:29.340 --> 03:05:33.380
for Orange Lounge Radio. You can hear them now.

03:05:33.380 --> 03:05:41.260
So any after birth thoughts, Jamie? You were looking at some interesting movies

03:05:41.260 --> 03:05:47.140
earlier. I think your mic might be off. Check the mic,

03:05:47.140 --> 03:05:51.740
make sure it's not off. This has got Sable in it, in the bad fake

03:05:51.740 --> 03:05:58.740
porn thing. But it's widescreen, so it's forgiven. Because pan and scan sucks.

03:05:58.740 --> 03:06:05.180
Yeah, I don't like pan and scan either. Pan and scan is bad because you lose a part of

03:06:05.180 --> 03:06:09.740
the picture. Everyone who says that the black bars cut

03:06:09.740 --> 03:06:16.880
off the screen is an idiot. I realize where it can be irritating, but here's

03:06:16.880 --> 03:06:19.780
what's most irritating. When they built the TVs, they should have made them the same size

03:06:19.780 --> 03:06:23.040
as the movie screens, and then we would have never had this problem, so F whoever came

03:06:23.040 --> 03:06:24.040
up with that idea.

03:06:24.040 --> 03:06:26.740
Well, you know what, my next TV is going to be a widescreen TV.

03:06:26.740 --> 03:06:30.180
Exactly, see that's the nice thing, now they are making the TVs the same size as the movies,

03:06:30.180 --> 03:06:34.660
so people will never have to worry about the black bars, and are you missing something

03:06:34.660 --> 03:06:37.820
with the widescreen, all that stuff, they won't have to worry about it ever again.

03:06:37.820 --> 03:06:38.820
It's already been thought of.

03:06:38.820 --> 03:06:40.380
You know what we need to do?

03:06:40.380 --> 03:06:41.380
We need a chill-a-thon.

03:06:41.380 --> 03:06:42.380
A chill-a-thon?

03:06:42.380 --> 03:06:44.660
We need a chill-a-thon.

03:06:44.660 --> 03:06:45.660
How so?

03:06:45.660 --> 03:06:49.180
Like, just take those two DVDs and watch them back to back.

03:06:49.180 --> 03:06:55.100
by me, and I have her new CD, so if I left it at work, don't.

03:06:55.100 --> 03:06:56.100
It's okay.

03:06:56.100 --> 03:06:59.780
And then just to break up the Jonas, watch Rejected.

03:06:59.780 --> 03:07:00.780
Okay.

03:07:00.780 --> 03:07:01.780
You know what?

03:07:01.780 --> 03:07:08.500
It's weird that on Bitter Films that made Rejected has a new compilation coming out,

03:07:08.500 --> 03:07:09.940
which should be good.

03:07:09.940 --> 03:07:11.300
It's going to be a bunch of their stuff.

03:07:11.300 --> 03:07:14.460
And they show Billy's balloon at Spike and Mike's, and that made me happy, because Billy's

03:07:14.460 --> 03:07:17.420
balloon is great, because I love when balloons beat up little children.

03:07:17.420 --> 03:07:18.420
Aww.

03:07:48.420 --> 03:07:52.220
Did I get rid of it?

03:07:52.220 --> 03:07:54.180
I don't think I would have deleted it, but I don't...

03:07:54.180 --> 03:07:55.180
Oh, there it is.

03:07:55.180 --> 03:07:56.180
There it is.

03:07:56.180 --> 03:07:58.340
If your anus is bleeding, use a tampon.

03:07:58.340 --> 03:08:02.440
I just got a copy off this Japanese site of max 30,000.

03:08:02.440 --> 03:08:07.220
It's two seconds long.

03:08:07.220 --> 03:08:10.620
That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard of in my entire life.

03:08:10.620 --> 03:08:12.620
What the hell?

03:08:12.620 --> 03:08:29.220
for the love of God, and all that is holy, my anus is bleeding, wow, that's great, that

03:08:29.220 --> 03:08:38.780
sounded like me shitting, that sounds like a robot taking a shit, aww, bye Zero, nice

03:08:38.780 --> 03:08:39.780
Nice knowing you.

03:08:39.780 --> 03:08:40.780
Bye Nico.

03:08:40.780 --> 03:08:41.780
Have fun in the castle.

03:08:41.780 --> 03:08:42.780
Take care.

03:08:42.780 --> 03:08:45.820
Okay, tonight's post show, we're going to start it off with that air remix, and then

03:08:45.820 --> 03:08:53.100
after the air remix, we're going to go into that Now Dance 2004 compilation from Britain

03:08:53.100 --> 03:08:58.260
because it's neat, and lots of good songs in it, including some Kylie Minogue, some

03:08:58.260 --> 03:09:01.700
Ian Van Dau, and some other artists you may know from Balmani releases.

03:09:01.700 --> 03:09:02.700
Enjoy.

03:09:02.700 --> 03:09:04.700
night

03:10:32.700 --> 03:10:39.700
Let me remind, she chose not to cry

03:10:39.700 --> 03:10:46.700
It's not a lie, it's not a lie

03:10:46.700 --> 03:10:53.700
It's not a lie, it's not a lie

03:10:53.700 --> 03:11:08.700
Let me remind, she chose not to cry It's alright, for your lover has come home

03:11:08.700 --> 03:11:20.700
Never ever be alone, by your side I'll always say, never ever be alone.
