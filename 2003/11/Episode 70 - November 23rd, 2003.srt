2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:25,320
And now for our feature presentation.

3
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,620
Orange Lounge Radio Live is now on the air.

4
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:37,220
Orange Lounge Radio Live is a live talk program dedicated to all things Bomani and Bensum.

5
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,620
Orange Lounge Radio may contain adult content, but you probably shouldn't let your children

6
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,620
listen.

7
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:50,940
If you do let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio, they may turn into evil little

8
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,060
demons from hell!

9
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:58,380
Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.

10
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:07,140
Now you see that evil will always triumph, because good is dumb.

11
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,180
Fact, drunk and stupid is no way to go flex up.

12
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,820
He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body.

13
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:18,580
Well, it makes you look like an ass is what he does, Ed.

14
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,580
Hamburgers!

15
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,620
The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.

16
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,620
I was a huge...

17
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,620
Cool.

18
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,620
Cool.

19
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,620
Do you mind if I take my new car for a ride?

20
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,620
That's right.

21
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,620
The only thing you're gonna be riding is me.

22
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,620
Have you seen my picture?

23
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,620
Lena?

24
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,620
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my underground lair.

25
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,620
So it was you.

26
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,620
I was going to expose you.

27
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,620
I know.

28
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,620
So I choose to expose myself.

29
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,620
Please, there are ladies present.

30
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,620
This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.

31
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,620
Dark Sakura.

32
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,620
Oh my god, I see a bloody stump!

33
00:02:52,620 --> 00:03:04,300
Skye, Loki, Orange Lounge Radio

34
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:11,940
We are live and this is episode number 70 for November the 23rd of 2003 you're tuned

35
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:18,060
in to the Bamani Scene's most underprepared radio station of all things being money.

36
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,940
My name is Rob Roberts if you might know me as Skye.

37
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:27,780
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, back from her two-week vacation,

38
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,140
the happiest bunny on the farm, Ms. Jamie Summers.

39
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,140
You know her better?

40
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,140
Hi!

41
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,140
Long time no talk.

42
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,140
I'm cooking.

43
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,140
Bye.

44
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,140
Tonight, she's Iron Chef Sakura right now.

45
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,860
In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

46
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,860
Hello.

47
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,860
I need to un...

48
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,860
What the hell?

49
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,820
The cords have just all mated with each other.

50
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:51,540
loki picked up a microphone and it's like taking the christmas lights out of

51
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,500
the box on christmas

52
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,580
what the hell is this doing here? there's like a ribbing cable

53
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,900
this random printer cord is mixed in too

54
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,060
uh... anyway

55
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,020
if we sound a little disorganized tonight it's because we are

56
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,980
we have jamie over here cooking

57
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,300
we have uh...

58
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,060
loki over here you know trying to untangle the cords me i've been feeling

59
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,500
kinda uh... this evening i'll get into that later

60
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,820
so i'm just like

61
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,600
now getting with it my tylenol is finally kicking in and i can like see again

62
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,680

63
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,200
say hello to zero is here and i know there's no microphone

64
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,000
hi how you doing

65
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,720
i was here like two weeks ago how could it be that long? long enough

66
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,080
what did you bring with you tonight?

67
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,280
it's a surprise

68
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,480
if you really want me to tell them first break

69
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,600
who else did you bring with you here? let's have her introduce herself

70
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Most people who are listening should know her if they go to RVGL, or actually did go to RVGL.

71
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,600
Yeah, but we're a worldwide show, so...

72
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
Yeah, that's right.

73
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Well, there she is.

74
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Miko.

75
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
Hi.

76
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
How are you?

77
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,600
I'm fine. How are you?

78
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,600
I'm good. Welcome to our disorganized mess of a show.

79
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Well, this is fun.

80
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Alright, well, hey, the fun's just about to start.

81
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
We haven't even gotten there yet.

82
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Alright, we're going to take a quick break to try and organize ourselves,

83
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,600
and we'll get that surprise ready, and we'll start off the show with it

84
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
as soon as we come back.

85
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,600
After a little bit of this and a little bit of that from the Bomani world.

86
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:36,600
back.

87
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:17,640
You leave me when I'm at the woods Feelin' as if I've been cursed

88
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:23,640
As if I've been cursed with a cold within

89
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,640
Days goodbye and still I think of you

90
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:38,640
Days when I couldn't live my life without you

91
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,640
Without you

92
00:06:42,640 --> 00:07:10,640
I know that you understand me I know that you understand me

93
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,640
I know that you're lost to me, I know you're lost on my lips

94
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,640
You're so peculiarly derided, I know that you're the lady

95
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,640
I know that you're lost to me, I know you're lost on my lips

96
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,640
Maybe you could tell

97
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,640
Sometimes I'm sick and fussy, see through my speech on me

98
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,640
Maybe I'll be fly but I can't trust that you're nothing

99
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,640
I know that you just hear me

100
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,640
I know you just want me

101
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,640
Yes, I need you

102
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,640
Maybe I feel guilty

103
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,640
Maybe I should be taking my pain

104
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,640
Maybe I should be taking my pain

105
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:18,640
Maybe she should be taking my pain

106
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,640
I can't change the time

107
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,640
I'm so mad

108
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,640
I really like it

109
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,640
I really like

110
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,640
I can't find the

111
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,640
I'm the only one

112
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,640
I'm the only one

113
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,640
Yeah

114
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,640
Yeah

115
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,640
Yeah

116
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,640
Yeah

117
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,640
Yeah

118
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,640
Yeah

119
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,640
Yeah

120
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,640
Yeah

121
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,640
Maybe I

122
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,640
Will be taking my

123
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,640
you

124
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:44,080
Hey, did you hear about that show?

125
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,080
What show?

126
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,200
Well, they play a lot of grace and money and video of each game music, but if you listen

127
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,320
to it, you have to listen to it again within seven days.

128
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,120
Oh, I've heard of that station.

129
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,120
Really?

130
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,280
Yeah, I even listened to it a couple weeks ago.

131
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,780
Hey, what happens to you if you don't listen to it again?

132
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,280
Well, you die.

133
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,780
I what?

134
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,080
Hey! Wait!

135
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,080
What's this crazy bitch doing coming out of my computer screen?

136
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,280
Aaaaaah.

137
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,280
Orange Lounge Radio.

138
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,280
Listen or die!

139
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,280
Seven days.

140
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,280
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

141
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,780
Episode number seventy.

142
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,780
Yo.

143
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,780

Click on Orange Lounge and click on Chat.

145
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,280
And he tells me it's good, and I believe my friends usually.

146
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,280
Do you believe everything everyone tells you?

147
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,280
Yes.

148
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:04,280
You know, Rob, I have some, uh, swampland I could sell you in Arizona.

149
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,280
What?

150
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,280
You have one?

151
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,280
I have some swampland I could sell you in Arizona.

152
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
Really?

153
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,280
Is it by the beach?

154
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,280
Yeah.

155
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,280
Oh, cool.

156
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,280
Um, anyway.

157
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,280
They have white gauges in their shivers too.

158
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:22,280
Of course the chat room's going, of course Rob doesn't eat fish, he's a fag, ha ha ha ha.

159
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,160
funny. That joke was funny maybe ten years ago?

160
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:32,040
Was that from the page of the 23rd? Yeah. Of course. Where else? Anyway, let's get

161
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:39,320
into that big surprise I was talking about earlier. Yes, Zero has brought over his sex

162
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:48,960
box and with that comes DDR UltraMix, which I have not seen at all yet and I think a lot

163
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,960
plugging component cables into a RCA system.

164
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,960
Yeah.

165
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:31,960
Basically the way that the screen looks is kind of built up as if you're looking at a concert stage.

166
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,960
It's got like a whole little set of ratchery type things on the side.

167
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:40,960
And on the opening screen it has like spotlights on the top and it's mostly really bright white.

168
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,960
And out of all of those EDR games it has the coolest menu music.

169
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,960
Yeah.

170
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:51,820
Agree so far just with the menus and everything. I've been incredibly impressed so yeah, I'm sorry Jamie

171
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,420
Yeah, it does I'm kind of surprised okay

172
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:03,180
I want to see I have heard that do that thing has a really scandalous gay video

173
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,380
Yeah, you know I want to see it. We figured that you would like this video

174
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,860
I must do that thing so if we could play do that thing, please

175
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,860
And then you guys can hear this, too.

176
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,860
This is a funny song.

177
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,860
I think we're okay. I'll just...

178
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,860
Oh, you better watch the video.

179
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,860
Oh. Yeah!

180
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,860
Okay, there's like... Wow.

181
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:43,360
This is the gayest video I've ever seen in my life. There's like women in fur and half-naked men.

182
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:13,260
these two chicks are standing in front of a microphone that says the name of their band

183
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:18,860
the size it's very britney spears to me they look like britney spears clones i guess it's

184
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:25,860
girls

185
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,260
oh my god they're not wearing pants that's awesome

186
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:41,260
god damn it why can't this be in color

187
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:48,260
Ready Steady Go by Paul Oakenfold

188
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:16,260
kostjamrh ready steady go by Paul Kvoltz

189
00:16:46,260 --> 00:17:08,140
But they got all the elements of the song, like perfect, and what I'm really impressed

190
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:15,900
of is the fact that almost all the songs, like the license lines, they all have really

191
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:43,180
p0k3smot42o

192
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,180
Strictly the motherfucker

193
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,180
Strictly the motherfucker

194
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,180
Ready, steady, go

195
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:18,660
All right, that was Ready Steady Go by Paul Ogenfold.

196
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,500
We're playing DDR UltraMix here on Orange Laundry Radio.

197
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,120
No webcam tonight, guys, sorry.

198
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,120
We haven't been able to get it working again since the computer upgrade.

199
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:35,120
And we can't hook UltraMix directly into our video card either, because we don't have that either.

200
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:42,120
They also have a cool song that, of course, most people know it, Castles in the Sky.

201
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,120
Yeah, Castles in the Sky, most people know that song already.

202
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,120
They did a really good job with the stuff for that too.

203
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,120
Let's hear one of the remixes. I'd like to play one of the new remixes for everybody.

204
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,120
The two remixes that are on here right now...

205
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,120
What are the unlocks so far? What have you unlocked?

206
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:04,120
The unlocks that I've gotten so far are the Metal Gear Solid song from Beatania.

207
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,120
Oh, this is Keep Your Body Movin' by Thuggy D.

208
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:15,120
The cool thing about this Thuggy D guy is the fact that he remixed Absolute and Insertion.

209
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,120
I think most people are pretty convinced that this is just Scotty D from Drop the Bomb.

210
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,520
It's actually not really yeah

211
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:33,520
Yeah, they have a link on the internet to where you can go and get his group information.

212
00:19:52,520 --> 00:20:01,520
This is very interesting, it's um, I haven't heard a DDR song about DDR in a long time.

213
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,520
Really, I thought this was probably the worst song on the whole night.

214
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,520
Yeah, this is definitely like an old stupid media song.

215
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:21,520
It's interesting, I'll give it that.

216
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:28,520
I also unlocked one of the Incident Prayers.

217
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:41,520
Somebody had told me that Santa Milette, the BLT style, is in the MOC, actually.

218
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,520
No, it's just already in there. It's out of the MOC.

219
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,520
Oh, the remixed Santa Milette, the new one.

220
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
I haven't heard that yet.

221
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,520
Well, it's not new if you play 4 style, but...

222
00:20:50,520 --> 00:21:15,280
p0k3smot42o

223
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:39,840
kostjamrh

224
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:38,280
morsdraconis

225
00:23:38,280 --> 00:24:02,900
kostjamrh

226
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:09,900
Here's your typical slowdown that you're used to in the normal insertion.

227
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:41,900
kostjamrh No speed up at the end.

228
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:11,900
I mean, I just wonder if they do make another one for the Xbox. If they do, um, from what I understand, this is just more of a promised catch, to bring one to it.

229
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,900
What? Oh, yeah, it's more of a dance meeting.

230
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:26,900
Yeah, I mean, if they do, for the fact, make a new one, I wonder if he's gonna be back doing more stuff. If he's gonna turn into, you know, a Scotty D, or...

231
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,900
We'll see.

232
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,900
All right, let's pull the plug on UltraMix for now.

233
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,900
God, no, turn off the love to me, Jesus.

234
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,900
All right.

235
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,900
Yeah, we'll play that one.

236
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,900
Maybe later in the show we'll get to the Metal Gear 1 and the shiny disco balls.

237
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,900
Some people want to hear that too.

238
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:53,900
Anyway, Ryan, you've been playing this more than anybody else here really.

239
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,900
Being a DDR fan, what did you think of UltraMix?

240
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,900
and compare it to Max 2 for PlayStation 2?

241
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:05,900
Well, I mean, you can kind of compare it as out of the box that Max 2 would be better.

242
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:16,900
But a lot of the redeeming qualities to the Xbox One is the fact that out of the box

243
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,900
it's got a couple good remixes and it has a couple new songs that you haven't heard.

244
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:25,900
And on top of that, it's more of a party game now for the fact that you can have

245
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:32,200
four people playing in your house at the same time, which we actually tested around a little

246
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:38,400
bit last night, and it's pretty fun because it gets pretty competitive. On top of that,

247
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,700
of course, you have the Xbox Live stuff where you can get on there and play up to four people

248
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:52,700
at once, transferring edits back and forth and stuff like that. I managed to play against

249
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:58,340
one guy with an edit he had. And seriously, a lot of these people who made edits are really,

250
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:04,180
really bad. It almost makes a lot of the Tournaments 4 stuff look good. I mean, it's that sad.

251
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:07,380
About the Xbox Live, though, can you talk to them while you're playing?

252
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:12,060
Yeah. When you buy an Xbox Live with the DDR pad, if you look in the front of the DDR pad,

253
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,380
it has a part where you can hook your communicator in, and they give you like a six...

254
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,380
Oh, so it's hooked to the pad?

255
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,980
Yeah. And you can put a memory card in there, too.

256
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,980
Oh.

257
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:23,340
the cool thing is they give you a six foot extension for your headset. It only goes down

258
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,260
about three feet. You can get a longer extension for it so you can talk while you're dancing.

259
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:32,700
It goes into the controller port. Yeah. And another good thing too that I was really impressed

260
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:38,660
with was the actual pad that comes with it if you buy it. I know a lot of people say,

261
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:45,060
oh, we have really good anti-slip stuff. That pad on the Xbox, I got a running start about

262
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:50,500
10 feet away, jumped up on it, and it didn't move anywhere. I was able to play stuff like

263
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:56,500
Sugaru really, really well, double-aided. So, I mean, there's no problem with the pad.

264
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:01,860
It's all a really, really good thing all around. And plus, the online stuff, you're gonna be

265
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:05,700
able to download new characters, you're gonna be able to download new songs. And if they

266
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:10,500
keep going at the rate they are with the new songs they've released onto the game itself,

267
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:15,020
and they have those really good steps like that with the exception of a couple

268
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:19,140
it's going to prove to be a very good

269
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:23,380
one of my buddies had said he was playing the uh... ddr xbox online

270
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,500
he was playing through xbox live

271
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,980
and he was playing some guy

272
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,220
when challenging him and then at the end he beat this guy and he heard over the

273
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,260
microphone

274
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,740
like he heard a kind of distance

275
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,060
man this guy just beat me

276
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:37,420
yeah he says this xbox live thing really makes

277
00:29:37,420 --> 00:30:00,420
Do you hear some of that chatter online is really funny?

278
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,420
Except for the delay.

279
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:35,420
Have you tried buying the new songs yet? I hear that you can buy five new songs for five bucks right now on Xbox Live.

280
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:42,420
Yeah, you can. I actually haven't had a chance to do it yet, because my Cat5 cable is not long enough to reach my Xboxes, so I gotta do it somewhere.

281
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,420
I might do it tonight before I leave here.

282
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,420
Oh.

283
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,420
Or maybe I can do it by the end of the show, since we have a spare cable.

284
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:51,420
That'd be interesting, yeah. Actually, we have a spare cable. Maybe we could buy the songs.

285
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,420
That'd be interesting.

286
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,420
I can do it with no problem. I have all set up to do it.

287
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,420
Alright.

288
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:59,420
So we'll see what comes out. I don't know if they're selling characters yet, though.

289
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:17,420
kostjamrh In My Eyes is in it and Mind Parasite

290
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:24,420
kostjamrh I heard from what they are going to try to do is throw as much extreme stuff

291
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:44,420
kostjamrh I had also heard that Santa Marte, the BLT style from 4 styles, is in there too, so that would be a fun unlock.

292
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:57,420
kostjamrh The problem with the unlocks on here, and it's not even so much as a problem, it's like, after you play one song, which anyone who plays this probably won't mind knowing, the Metal Gear song from Beatmania is the first song you unlock.

293
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:06,420
You unlocked Santa, if I remember correctly, by I think double A-ing or passing Santa on all difficulties.

294
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,420
Really?

295
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,420
Yeah, I'll have to try that.

296
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:20,420
I also know that there's some, there is supposedly an unlock everything code, like how 2DX had, you know, what if you got like, what was it, 573 or something like that, it would unlock everything.

297
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:27,500
everything. They're supposedly something like that on the Xbox, though I'm not sure exactly

298
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:33,800
how they plan on having it done. I wouldn't say UltraMix is better than the Extreme Japanese

299
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:41,540
yet, because it doesn't have as many songs. Out of the box, it's got like 38 songs, and

300
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:46,940
you can only unlock like 9 more, which that's the real assy part about it. You know what,

301
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:53,080
But though it's all credit for Ultramix, it's great because it's new.

302
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,220
They've made old stuff look really new.

303
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:01,040
They've kind of redone the interface, and like you said, the stage select music is awesome.

304
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:05,540
They have some innovative new modes with the whole live play and the four player thing.

305
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,380
They've really taken steps in the right direction.

306
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:10,940
I've got to totally credit Konami of Hawaii for making an interesting DDR mix.

307
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:15,760
I suppose also there's a mode with the arrows where if you step on a certain arrow, it gives

308
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,160
more life tier, life bar or something like that too.

309
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:22,280
Yeah, it's supposedly one of the unlockable modes. There's supposed to be two new unlockable

310
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,280
modes. Wow.

311
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:28,340
I just don't know about it yet. But yeah, I mean, this mix all together is shaping up

312
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,240
to be really good, if they keep up on those downloads. I mean, it's really cool if they

313
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,560
do have five new songs, but what I don't want to see is they go, you know, maybe a few weeks,

314
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:41,160
because it's supposed to be like every two weeks I think they're going to do that, or

315
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:46,200
once a month and what will be stupid is if they drop it after two months and they never

316
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,440
do it because I don't think they will for the fact they can make the money but you know

317
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,040
it's happened with stuff like that before.

318
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:58,580
Let's see the unlockables. They've got of course the Metal Gear Solid 2 Mission R by

319
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:05,280
LED from BeatMania. That's to unlock that you get any grade of an A on any song. Grade

320
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:11,660
Radio 6 Cyber by Taka, that's another unlock, AA any song. Put Your Faith in Me Saturday

321
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:18,620
Night Mix, quit a song. I quit it because my phone rang. And Paranoia Rebirth, get a

322
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:24,840
C or higher up for Paranoia Eternal on all three difficulties. Colors for Extreme, play

323
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:31,700
a lot of songs. It starts getting like that. Healing Vision and Angelic Mix, get a C or

324
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:37,660
higher for Healing Vision on all three difficulties. Santa Mora, whatever, the BLT style for Santa

325
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:45,060
is, yeah, C or higher for any Santa song, or for Santa on all three difficulties. Max

326
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:52,060
300, double, triple A any song, or pass it on roulette, and Orion 78 Civilization Mix

327
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:56,500
Beat Challenge Mode. So those are all the unlocks. I mean, that's, that's good unlock

328
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:03,660
stuff though right there. Just, I'm just curious to see what they're gonna sell. If they sell

329
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:08,660
any of the other Macs or anything. I still don't like the idea of unlocking old songs

330
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:13,020
but since this is Xbox's first mix we'll let it slide and the fact that there is some really

331
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:17,820
good stuff that you do unlock in there. There's the one concern though is that how people

332
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:25,380
are gonna cheat the system. And the only, I think that people are gonna find a way to

333
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:29,880
do it though to copy them not that I would encourage it you know I would

334
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,680
expect for people to download well yeah like with the like what we do for

335
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:43,620
Phantasy Star with the with the game shark and a laptop that's all you um but

336
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:48,480
um you know I just I'd like to encourage you know for anyone who's listening who

337
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,680
has the game or plans on getting it for the Xbox go ahead and buy your downloads

338
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:59,680
Don't try to cheat the system, in this case.

339
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,680
Yeah, because then they'll make new DDRs and blah blah blah, everybody's happy.

340
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:13,680
For the simple case, if you're buying the Xbox version, obviously you're buying it so you can play online and so you can download new songs.

341
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:20,680
kostjamrh And DDR will be dead and it will be all your fault!

342
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:50,800
Way out there statement I'm going to get my butt kicked for, but maybe if DDR is successful

343
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,800
enough on the Xbox, Microsoft will have the balls to tell them to bring 2DX over here.

344
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:01,320
Because that could be something that could make a lot of people interested in an Xbox

345
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,320
really fast.

346
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,640
Okay, here's the thing. If they're going to do something like that, they have to make

347
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,840
the key presses and stuff and the songs and everything as good as they have done on some

348
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,320
of these with the steps and the song choices. As long as they do that, I would have no problem

349
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,840
buying it. But if it comes to the point where they're going to release another crappy ass

350
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:22,320
US mix, I will refuse to buy it or even play it. And it's just going to get that bad.

351
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:28,240
Rumor is, now take this with a grain of salt, rumor is apparently this is published in some

352
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:34,160
Konami newsletter in Japan this week. 7th Style is on its way, 80 songs. So we'll see.

353
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,520
Happy. We don't know any details yet, but we will

354
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,200
keep our eyes posted. Well, you know what I was thinking that it

355
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:47,300
it could be possible for them to do especially on Xbox, keyboard mania. There is a US keyboard

356
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:53,720
mania released for PC. Yeah, I remember we talked about it on one show here and information

357
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:59,520
was scarce as it is, so it was a really under promoted thing. I mean just think about it,

358
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:06,520
if it's on the PC it can go on the Xbox no problem. Right. So, perhaps they might decide

359
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:11,120
might decide to try that one. It'd be, you know, the way keyboard mania was, you know,

360
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:15,840
a very small market, but bring it out, put enough of a price tag on it, and they'll make

361
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,840
their money back.

362
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,720
I know. If there was enough interest to keep that PC one alive when we barely know anything

363
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:27,080
about it, and, you know, some people actually consider our station a source of news, shock,

364
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,240
we barely know anything about it. I don't know how this keyboard mania's thing's making

365
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,880
its money on PC, but...

366
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:39,000
One last thing about the UltraMix that's kind of cool is if you have a metal pad for the

367
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,440
PlayStation 2, you can go to Fry's or whatever your main heavy hitter electronics store is

368
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,520
and buy a little $20 adapter and you can use it on the Xbox because it actually does work

369
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,680
because it's mapped out to the buttons.

370
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,680
So you can actually use your metal pads or even if you don't want to spend the money

371
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:04,160
on a new Microsoft pad and you have PlayStation 1s laying all around, spend $21.74 and go

372
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:12,800
and buy an adapter and you can play all your games. And it's really worth it for the fact

373
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,600
that, I mean, some people also don't like the Xbox controller for pretty much anything

374
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,040
or fighting games and stuff. You can always use your PlayStation controller too. It's

375
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,040
worth using.

376
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:28,880
Okay, you guys want to take a break or you want to just go into some how was your week,

377
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,880
how was your day?

378
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,080
Because I know we've got a lot to talk about here.

379
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:36,680
Alright, well, Jamie, you were gone for some time here, so...

380
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,680
Two whole weeks.

381
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,680
Two whole weeks.

382
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,680
That's a long time, you know.

383
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,680
Well, how was your month?

384
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,680
How was your day?

385
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:50,840
Well, Ma and John went with me to Alabama, and we stayed at my grandmother's place.

386
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:55,640
And basically it was a lot of running around in my grandma's car and finding people and

387
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:01,280
seeing old friends and visiting and doing some gaming which made me happy because I

388
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,080
haven't done any gaming since the last time I was in Alabama.

389
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:10,240
Got to see a lot of people I really missed.

390
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,120
We watched so many movies while I was there.

391
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:18,160
Finally saw The Ring, finally, multiple times while I was there.

392
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:23,260
And then we rented Ringu, and it was okay, but I liked the ring.

393
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:31,200
And then we saw Scary Movie 3 and Kill Bill again, and the third Matrix movie, which was

394
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:40,680
heh, which everything in that movie happened exactly how I expected it to, except for the

395
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:48,080
very end, which I'm not going to spoil for anybody.

396
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,080
I haven't seen it yet.

397
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,080
I'm not answering any questions on that.

398
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,080
He turns into a bunny.

399
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:58,080
Yeah, he turns into a bunny and scampers off into the sunset.

400
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:04,760
And you thought all those, how far does the rabbit hole thing go, was all just like, you

401
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,760
know, metaphors.

402
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,760
Uh-uh.

403
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:13,920
He was, he was going on a skateboard in a little, you know, vest with a pocket watch

404
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,920
going, I'm late.

405
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,840
It was fighting Smith, and then all of a sudden, the wild stallions come in.

406
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:30,160
Yeah, all of a sudden, Alex Schwinner shows up like, dude, we're in the wrong movie.

407
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,160
Kill me now.

408
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:41,600
Anyway, I really wanted to go to the French Quarter while I was there, but I didn't get

409
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,600
to.

410
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
We just...

411
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,600
Pout.

412
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,520
I got into New Orleans, drove back, although we did eat at a really nice buffet at the

413
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:53,880
Beaux Ravages in Biloxi, and it was free.

414
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:59,120
And let's see, I played DDR at cyber station in my build.

415
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,920
The dance maniacs machine was gone and that made me cry.

416
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,920
Really?

417
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:10,480
Yeah, but the DDR machine there was kind of crap, so I twisted my knee playing on that

418
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,480
machine.

419
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:16,920
I hadn't played any DDR for a month because of that nasty sinus infection I had.

420
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,520
I'd never got a chance to go find the BeatMania machine.

421
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,720
I found out where it is.

422
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,720
It was at the mall.

423
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,840
I used to work at it, Springdale Mall, and they're renovating the mall.

424
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:32,040
They're rebuilding the whole center of it, so they moved the machine actually to a little,

425
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:38,720
I think it's like a network gaming place slash arcade, but it's over for anyone who lives

426
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:44,500
in that area who might be listening to the show. It's on Moffitt Road by University.

427
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,420
Just this little sort of hole-in-the-wall gaming place. But I didn't get a chance to

428
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,420
go.

429
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,420
I have an on-topic question.

430
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,420
Ah.

431
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:53,460
What is up with those networking gaming places? I've seen them popping up everywhere lately,

432
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:57,580
like here in Sacramento where Orange Island is based. I've seen at least three brand new

433
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,940
network gaming places in the area.

434
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:01,660
There was one that we passed on the way up here.

435
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,700
What did... Are they really that popular? I've never been to one in my life.

436
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,740
They're gonna go the way of the dot com business.

437
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,380
I completely forgot where I was, thank you very much.

438
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:42,020
You were playing DDR in the BeatMania machine?

439
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:46,700
Yeah, and I never got to play the BeatMania machine, so, but it's a, what I had been told

440
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:52,820
it was a 6th mix and I wanted to play it.

441
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:59,060
I took my mom out to dinner for her birthday at the original Oyster House, which is like

442
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:01,300
the best seafood place in the universe.

443
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:05,220
All the seafood that they cook there is all locally caught stuff.

444
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:10,580
This is really yummy, fresh catfish and all kinds of food.

445
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:11,580
Better than red lobster?

446
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:19,420
Red lobster, okay, red lobster is good, but nothing beats fish caught in the Gulf.

447
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:25,460
And I have to say this, you eat seafood out here, all the West Coast seafood does not

448
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:30,600
taste as good as seafood caught on the East Coast, I'm sorry, it does not.

449
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:35,320
It has this sort of weird flavor to it.

450
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:39,400
Real seafood is in the south.

451
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:43,440
And I got to eat fried okra, which made me happy, because nobody out here knows how to

452
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,440
cook fried okra, right?

453
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,040
Because they make it all slimy and icky.

454
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,360
I ate the Cracker Barrel.

455
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:58,320
It made me sick, because I'm not used to country cooking anymore, but it was pretty good.

456
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,320
I enjoyed it.

457
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:04,200
We ran into lots of movies, like I said.

458
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:11,240
I got to see Undercover Brother, that was like the funniest movie ever.

459
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,240
Not really much else happened.

460
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,160
Oh yeah, we went to Walmart a lot.

461
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,160
Super Walmart.

462
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,800
There's two of them.

463
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,120
I was so happy because I love Super Walmart.

464
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,920
Now I've heard that associated with the South before.

465
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,600
Well, they can't have Super Walmart out here.

466
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,840
There's like one, and it's in, what, Chico?

467
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,800
They're going to open a Super Walmart in Chico.

468
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,800
But Chico is, you know, just like most rural parts of the nation, so...

469
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,800
Well, maybe it's hardly rural.

470
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,800
I know, but...

471
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,800
I don't know how to put it. Forget it.

472
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,800
But, um...

473
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,800
Maybe it's this college town thing, I don't know.

474
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:44,800
Maybe.

475
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,800
But, um, the, uh...

476
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,800
We went there, like, practically every night.

477
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,800
It's like, we're bored, let's go to Walmart.

478
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,800
So...

479
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,800
Ah, it reminds me of college.

480
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:00,800
When I was going to school, it was Walmart or Bruno's the grocery store to go get liquor, but I'm sorry

481
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:07,740
I got my transcripts from school. Yay second go back to school. This is me off

482
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:11,160
I ordered two copies of my transcripts, you know two sealed copies

483
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:15,200
So if I go to one school or want to go to the other I can have both of those copies

484
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,640
They only sent me one of them. So I have to call them and bitch and fuss and moan

485
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,680
complain complain

486
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,600
The flight back was bumpy.

487
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:33,920
We went through this torrent right before we got into New Orleans and then there was

488
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,560
an accident and it was all kind of crappy, but our flights left within five minutes of

489
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,560
each other.

490
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:45,480
We had everything timed so well, you know, when our flights were leaving and everything.

491
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:51,280
The ride to Denver was bumpy, the flight to Sacramento was pretty smooth, and then I got

492
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,280
in town and was like, hey, it's cold.

493
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:58,060
By the way, Mobile has the most bipolar weather ever.

494
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,060
It's like, I'm hot, I'm cold.

495
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,060
I'm hot, I'm cold.

496
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,060
I'm hot, I'm cold.

497
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:02,060
It's like menopause or something.

498
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:05,780
Anyway, it was really kind of warm.

499
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:11,460
Of course, it was humid the whole time, but around Thursday-ish, it got really cold, like

500
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,380
in the 50s or so.

501
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:17,180
It was cold weather, and then Monday, hi, I'm hot.

502
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:18,180
It's 80.

503
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:30,220
look, the sun's out and people drive really slow there. I came back feeling really happy.

504
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:35,880
That's the best place anyone can go for a vacation because it's relaxing. No one's going

505
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:44,060
to rush you or anything. People are polite. California sucks. I mean, there's more to

506
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:51,980
here. But I think the vast majority of people out here just suck. I said vast majority,

507
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:56,340
not everybody. Of course, the people that I associate with that I consider my friends

508
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:00,420
are in the non-suck portion of the community. Well, okay.

509
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:07,100
But most everybody else. There's not as many polite people. No one's going to smile at

510
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:13,540
you when you walk down the road, or nod their head high, or hold a door for you, or be considerate.

511
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:17,980
you know people are too much in our hurry I smile at other people like when

512
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:21,100
I've gotten a raise and they probably look at you like you just escaped from the asylum like when

513
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:29,140
I've gotten a raise at work or something it just you never see the difference

514
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:36,740
until you've been away from it for so long that it was just I don't know it was

515
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:41,340
sort of almost disappointing to come back almost disappointing but I mean

516
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:46,180
And this is, of course, where my home is, and I couldn't imagine living anywhere else.

517
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:49,140
But still, it was just...

518
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:54,200
I found myself getting homesick right when I got off the plane, so it was really weird.

519
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:59,540
And as for my day, I got back and decided to try the test server for Ragnarok.

520
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:04,940
So I'm on the Sacre server, enjoying it.

521
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:09,140
I'm supposed to be finishing up the last chapter of my fanfic, but I've only barely started

522
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,140
it.

523
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:13,500
and

524
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,660
you know work was work. One good thing though I found

525
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:20,140
I realized once I counted everything up I only work six

526
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:24,420
days this entire month. But you get paid for it all right?

527
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:28,540
Oh hell yeah. Right on. Because we got two holidays this month

528
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:31,660
my vacation and plus we get two days off for Thanksgiving

529
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:36,660
so it works out cool for me.

530
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,540
Anything else? I am glad to be back don't get me wrong. Welcome back.

531
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:41,540
I am glad to be back.

532
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:18,980
So I ended up playing some Guitar Freaks and some Fourth Plus and No Extreme and a little

533
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:23,540
bit of F Zero.

534
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:29,740
And earlier this week I was still sitting on my computer getting it all working fine.

535
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:36,060
I'm kind of in the process right now of getting my copies of certain programs that I don't

536
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:42,340
owned, put them on my computer, you know, so I was busy downloading my updated software

537
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:49,020
and all that. And I got a few other games I need to try out, like I just got Simpsons

538
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:53,980
Hit and Run, which looks pretty good, and then Celebrity Deathmatch, which looks kind

539
00:50:53,980 --> 00:51:01,300
of fun. And then Midnight Club 2 didn't work for me. For some reason, the image that it

540
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:08,540
wanted me to burn was larger than the CD I have, so, that sucked. And then, what else?

541
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:15,060
I've been working on a list of something for a secret something that I'll be, you know,

542
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:21,500
doing later. I can't really say right now because I just can't. It's not close to completion

543
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:29,460
yet. But, on this list right now, there's a good, oh, over 600 things on this list,

544
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:36,540
so it's a long list that I need to work on. Anyways, so I've been doing that, and I was

545
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:44,580
going to work on the web page for Orange Lounge, but I never got around to it, and yeah. And

546
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:54,940
also, yeah, I don't know. My show's in limbo right now, too, so. I don't know. It's been

547
00:51:54,940 --> 00:52:01,620
like that, kind of like a whole week to spend in limbo. That's pretty much it.

548
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:05,420
Alright, yeah, more programming notes to come after the next break. There's some important

549
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:10,400
programming notes that we'll need to get out of the way and take care of. My week and my

550
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:15,260
day was okay. I really didn't do anything too exciting this week. Monday night I took

551
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:19,580
Magus and Angel home, so they know Sky was on Wednesday instead, and that was good. Oh,

552
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:24,080
on the way to take Magus and Angel home, we stopped for Boba in Davis, and they have this

553
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:28,600
awesome new flavor which is this coffee toffee flavor it's great

554
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:31,880
uh... so there was that and then uh... friday

555
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:35,600
uh... i went out to spike and mike sick and twisted festival of animation over

556
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,680
downtown

557
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:39,960
and that's the third year in a row i've gone and there's uh... some pretty funny

558
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:40,960
shit this year

559
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,560
uh... namely the ninjus was funny

560
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,120
and uh...

561
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,640
well so that was good

562
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:51,400
something about this giant stick figure that was a condom that was pretty good

563
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,860
happy tree friends as always was winner

564
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:59,740
But the best, by far, was here comes Dr. Tran.

565
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:01,940
Fucking hilarious.

566
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:07,620
If you want to visit www.beyondgrandpa.com and get all the information on oh shit it's

567
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:11,260
Dr. Tran, it's great and would be well worth your visit.

568
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:12,980
So that was fun.

569
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:15,580
And then yesterday I hung out with Jamie for a while where we worked on a couple of the

570
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:21,620
new promos you'll be hearing and got to see my buddy Eddie, who's in from out of town,

571
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:27,280
They made some home movies, not those kind of movies, and that was about it.

572
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,600
And then today was okay.

573
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:33,160
I woke up really late and then the power went out and that sucked.

574
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:38,940
And then I hurried up and worked on the new intro and I was going to go out and meet Pixie

575
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:43,260
Dust and no Stylin, but I didn't because Jamie was cooking, I remembered, so I didn't go

576
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:46,200
out to meet them.

577
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:50,220
And my eyes started hurting, which kind of sucked, but I took Tylenol and it's better

578
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:51,220
now.

579
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:57,100
I didn't catch whatever lanky style had because he had an eye infection the other day, but

580
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,680
I don't think it was pink eye though.

581
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,400
It was just something where the eyes were like really, really hurting.

582
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:05,440
I don't know, but I think I'm okay because I took Tylenol and I feel better.

583
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:07,280
So maybe it was just psychological.

584
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,440
I don't know.

585
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:14,160
So that was pretty much my week and my day.

586
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:19,120
Anyway, Zero or Miko, you guys have anything you want to share about your week and your

587
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,120
day?

588
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:27,120
the show

589
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:30,920
you talk into the microphone you just say hi people and

590
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:37,920
this is what's good and this is what sucks whatever

591
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,580
yes it is on

592
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:43,660
if you don't talk they'll make me sing

593
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:46,500
please talk

594
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,720
no

595
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:51,220
low-key does not saying we bring that out on special occasions and rating

596
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:55,860
stunts only

597
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,520
would you do yesterday

598
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,300
i can't remember

599
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,040
did you go to the offline at all this week

600
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:04,040
uh... yeah

601
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,800
to play anything interesting later

602
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,680
uh...

603
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,960
tdr extreme

604
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,200
right on

605
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,560
what uh... what

606
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,760
what was like

607
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:21,760
kostjamrh What was the last big song you passed in ddr extreme?

608
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:49,760
nico looks like a poor deer in the headlights right now with a microphone in her hand

609
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:54,760
they can hear me? can they?

610
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:59,760
i could pass cartoon heroes when ddr extreme first came out too

611
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,760
and then i didn't go for playing for a long time and i got fat and older and then i couldn't beat it

612
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:09,760
but i can beat it again

613
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:14,760
kostjamrh What do you think of Ultramix?

614
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:19,760
kostjamrh What do you think of Ultramix?

615
00:56:44,760 --> 00:57:09,520
p0k3smot42o

616
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,520
Okay.

617
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,520
And Rancho.

618
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,520
Okay.

619
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:16,260
Is that the one that says Dunkin' Donuts, too?

620
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:17,260
I guess not.

621
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,260
Forget it.

622
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:21,100
No, but we have the coffee by Dunkin' Donuts.

623
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,100
All right.

624
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,100
Good enough.

625
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:30,900
And what's the third one, if you're willing to share?

626
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,100
And I work at my school.

627
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:34,740
All right.

628
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:35,740
Yeah.

629
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:37,740
Hooray for school.

630
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:40,220
pay for school

631
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:45,220
that's why i like going to school is because i get paid

632
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:47,580
all right right on

633
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:48,900
okay so uh...

634
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:52,900
let's hear from zero we haven't heard from zero yet how uh... how was your week in your day

635
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,380
mister zero

636
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:58,580
no it was okay my week. You have your lower lip sticking out like you're pouty about something

637
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:02,860
i had to spend like every dime i had on my piece of shit

638
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:04,460
fucking car

639
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:11,100
You know, I only paid $100 for that car, so I wouldn't feel so bad if I set it in a nice,

640
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:15,180
happy roll and then jumped out and let it crash into a wall or incoming traffic.

641
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:16,180
It's...

642
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:18,380
God, my door doesn't shut!

643
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:23,580
So I had to tie it with a shoestring.

644
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:24,580
You tellin' me it's ghetto!

645
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:27,220
I know my car's ghetto.

646
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:33,060
It's not easy to fix, it's just I don't have the $50 for the stuff that I need to fix it.

647
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:38,720
I'm kind of pissed off for the fact that it says that the song pack 1 for Ultramix is

648
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:43,980
released and yet they won't update their fucking sites to tell you what's out.

649
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:46,780
There's a lot of stuff that Xbox Live is screwing up on right now.

650
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:50,300
Somebody had showed me a site that had the X... I thought it was an Xbox site.

651
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:53,420
No, I know it tells... No, it's not... I'll tell you right now it's not Xbox because I'm

652
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:56,060
on it. They're just totally making it look like crap.

653
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:59,580
They're still stuck in October now.

654
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:04,100
I would know anything about websites that never update. I've never heard of this.

655
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:05,220
Of course you haven't.

656
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,840
No, never. No, not at all.

657
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:11,300
Just like my live journal that never updates. But anyways,

658
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:12,140
so uh...

659
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:14,100
there's that, and

660
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:17,460
of course I got UltraMix, so I had a lot of fun with that.

661
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:22,380
Also, I started playing a little bit of uh... I think you need an UltraMix party.

662
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:26,440
I was thinking about it. I just gotta figure out how to plan it and when to.

663
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,340
I mean, I know how to plan it, I just don't know when.

664
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:30,340
p0k3smot42o I think I need to finish my cabinet

665
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:04,340
kostjamrh And she cooked us dinner tonight, so do launder here all you want. Bring fish and you can, uh...

666
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:10,340
kostjamrh Now I know why we couldn't download anything. I'm looking at their service status, and it says that it's down.

667
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,340
kostjamrh Huh, that sucks.

668
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:16,340
kostjamrh And I bet you if I go back to it, it'll say that it's up, and then it'll say it's down.

669
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:21,340
kostjamrh But, um, no yeah, I want to get everybody together, just to come over and have another b-money party because I miss it.

670
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:28,340
parties are fun. And I'm sorry I missed your last one. I think I just was having my period.

671
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:25,160
I want to get everybody together just because we haven't done it in a long time and every

672
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:30,480
time we get together it's a lot of fun.

673
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:31,480
No idea.

674
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,720
We don't know a lot of these people in our chat room, they're just there.

675
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:34,960
They just started showing up.

676
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,920
They just started showing up and we haven't kicked them out yet, so.

677
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:39,920
They're our neighbors, you're friends.

678
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:43,140
No, we love all our new chatters, hello to all the new chatters.

679
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:48,160
I've seen some new faces pop up this past couple weeks, so it's exciting.

680
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,160
And our old chatters too.

681
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:52,800
and xbox lives up now one of the odds of that one

682
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:56,120
it's everywhere now

683
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,480
we're not just we're fucking big it's sad

684
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,520
uh... anything else you want to share about your week and your day

685
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,440
i managed to make it here today

686
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,880
congratulations that is an accomplishment honestly throughout this christmas season

687
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,840
i have no idea how many days i'm gonna be here

688
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,040
cuz it's

689
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:15,000
i work in the mall i mean

690
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,880
it's alright you know

691
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:25,880
Well, here's the thing is that I'm trying to get coming back here every week, now that I have a car and stuff, kinda, that walks really fast but doesn't run.

692
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:35,880
Um, once I get my, once I get this work schedule figured out, there'll be some nights hopefully I'll get here, either that or I'll just come here late, if anything, so...

693
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:39,880
Yeah, the mall closes at six, right? So you guys are out there by seven.

694
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:40,880
Extended hours now.

695
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:41,880
DOPE!

696
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:45,880
Yeah, so I mean, there's some people closing way late for no apparent reason.

697
01:02:45,880 --> 01:03:05,880
kostjamrh You know who his boss is?

698
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:10,280
Yes, I know who his boss is.

699
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:14,040
And you think his boss would be sympathetic to the situation that there's this Orange

700
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:19,320
Lounge radio program, but no, that just makes him want to make him work more on Sunday nights.

701
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:20,320
Anyway.

702
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:22,320
I heard you're going to want TDX.

703
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,320
What?

704
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,320
You heard what?

705
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:25,840
What did you hear?

706
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,040
I heard that TDX is going to be at SunSplash.

707
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:34,120
Yeah, that's a rumor that always comes up, but we don't, I think they want to get it,

708
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:38,340
but maybe the people that actually buy the games don't.

709
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:39,340
Oh man.

710
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:40,340
Okay.

711
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:44,620
They were gonna get Derby Owners Club, that's before they found out it was gonna be $60,000

712
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:49,260
for a four-player cabinet, and they said fuck it because it's been out for a while and it's

713
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:53,840
not making the money it used to, and it would take like over a year to make the money back

714
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:54,840
on it.

715
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:55,840
So they said fuck it.

716
01:03:55,840 --> 01:04:00,840
But they do have $120,000 to spend on arcade games for this coming year.

717
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:06,300
So it's a possibility. I honestly don't want it there, because I think it'll get fucked

718
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:11,580
up the same way that, you know, the one that Scandia does.

719
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:12,580
Speaking of which...

720
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:18,140
And I'd rather them, like, upgrade their complete mix too to beat me to the final, or even,

721
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:22,260
like, I don't know if it's a possible upgrade machine to a beat me to three the final or

722
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:27,380
something like that. But I'd rather them do that, because at least it gets some play out

723
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:36,700
of it and clean up the machine a bit and replace the coin door on it and stuff. But, what else?

724
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:45,780
Oh, they were, well, they're supposed to get another DDR machine there. I can't say. But,

725
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:49,740
there's a new, there's possibly a new DDR machine coming in there. It's Tori, it's from

726
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:56,740
scandia

727
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:24,660
No, it gets even better. They left the bass speakers on there because you can't really

728
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:32,540
get rid of them. It's like they went to Kmart and bought a $150 little mini stereo system

729
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:38,440
because there's two really shitty speakers on top, like the detachable ones off of a

730
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:43,060
boom box or something. They're sitting up there like, you can't hear it, of course.

731
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:52,020
I mean, it wouldn't even matter. They don't care anymore. I've actually heard them say

732
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:57,640
they don't care anymore. That was the, you know, the shift managers were saying that,

733
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:02,360
and also the main guy there doesn't care. They care more about that stupid fucking hick

734
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:08,740
shooter game than they care about anything else, because people have been blowing money

735
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:09,740
in their left and right.

736
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:16,520
That's what we need to be teaching the people in the ghetto, to shoot white people.

737
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:20,000
I would love to take the camera over to Scandi and get a picture of that ascii machine though.

738
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,960
It's their 2DX machine works.

739
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,680
And it's a miracle.

740
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,400
I've got some Scandi tokens I need to blow.

741
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:32,860
No, I think I want to actually call the owners.

742
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:34,040
I think I, you know...

743
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:35,000
Have a ball.

744
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,320
I have all the stuff to hook a recorder up to my telephone.

745
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:39,120
Record the conversation, put it on air, it'll be funny.

746
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,120
I'll do it.

747
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:45,440
Not if you said that you were recording at the beginning of the phone call.

748
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:49,240
That's why every time you call a customer service place, they say this call may be recorded.

749
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:52,920
You want to interview them for a local radio station?

750
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:56,000
I'll do it.

751
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,780
Why does your arcade suck so bad?

752
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:00,780
Nobody cares.

753
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:02,000
Why are you losing money?

754
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,800
They asked me that again the other day.

755
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:09,280
shift magic guy comes up. And this is the guy who's like, oh man, you should apply here

756
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:13,200
because it seems like you really care about the games. I'm like, no, thank you. But he's

757
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:17,480
like, why are all your friends not coming here anymore? I said, look at your DDR machine.

758
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:22,400
And he's like, what? And I said, it looks like my computer on top of some speakers.

759
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:26,400
There's no, there's nothing on there. And he said, yeah, well that's because the speakers

760
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,400
didn't work. I said, if the speakers didn't work, you don't have to take the whole top

761
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:34,040
off. And he's like, yeah, there's some other legal issues coming up. So how about this?

762
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:36,040
Keith went to RVGL.

763
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:45,040
Well no, it's not that. They said legal issues came up, so I wonder if someone ragged on them about having their extreme or something like that.

764
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:51,040
Oh please, that would be the first case I've ever heard of anywhere where somebody said something like that.

765
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:54,040
Well for the fact that they said legal issues makes me wonder what it was.

766
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:57,040
They're retarded, they don't know what the hell they're talking about.

767
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:01,040
Some stupid baby fell off the machine and now they have a lawsuit.

768
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:09,040
My kid was climbing the machine, fell down, and cracked his head open, so you need to, like, remove that so he doesn't climb.

769
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:13,040
Darwin, doesn't that work?

770
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,040
So, I don't know. I think Scandia is gonna-

771
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:20,040
The music coming from that machine is making my child gay!

772
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:24,040
You need to remove that machine! It's making people gay!

773
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,040
No. Last-

774
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:32,040
Why do we have to listen to all this jap music? We live in the United States of America, not Japan!

775
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:36,040
Keep your music to your own country! Thank you!

776
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:09,040
For the record, I love the artichoke dip from the heffalup bar.

777
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:36,040
Anyway, let's take a break, because we've gone like an hour now without a break.

778
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:39,040
So I think we need to take a break. When we come back, we're going to have...

779
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,040
I want to do a cage match first. We're going to do a cage match first?

780
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:45,040
Fine. We'll do a cage match first. We'll do that fuse later.

781
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:52,040
Cage match when we come back from this break with more just cornucopia of Bimani music.

782
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:59,040
back.

783
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:25,040
My emotions still remain

784
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:28,040
All my heart still yearns cause the fire still burns

785
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:32,040
I can't put out the pain

786
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:37,040
I would never, never assume to leave me with a mental wound

787
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:44,040
You know the reason why I cannot give and forget

788
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:47,040
You have left me not for life

789
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:50,240
Bitch, what's got like a night?

790
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:57,040
I can't forgive and forget

791
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:04,640
Can't forgive and forget

792
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:11,640
You've only got yourself to blame.

793
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:57,120
Baby, it's all live gold Baby, it's all live gold

794
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:03,120
She's the one I'd like to call, whoa Baby, it's all it does

795
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:07,120
Ride forever, can't wait until tomorrow

796
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:35,120
I want you baby, maybe tonight

797
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,120
I take you far away

798
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:40,120
I see you dancing

799
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:43,120
Shining like a jewel

800
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,120
Burning for love

801
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:49,120
In the golden light of love inside of

802
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:52,120
My pride, my heaven

803
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:55,120
Your precious fire for me

804
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,120
Baby, it's all in gold

805
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:01,120
Reaching out, I don't wanna let you go

806
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,120
Baby, it's all in gold

807
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:10,120
Baby it's all this gold, shine forever, can't wait till tomorrow

808
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:15,120
Baby it's all this gold, reaching out I don't wanna let you go

809
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:21,120
Baby it's all this gold, shine forever, can't wait till tomorrow

810
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:34,120
I need you, baby

811
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:36,120
What is it for you?

812
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:59,120
I think you have my feelings My hopes are far away, so please

813
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:05,120
He got a dream in his face He got a shadow of a dream

814
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:09,120
It's time to say goodbye to my face

815
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:14,120
I don't want you alone I pray you'll be happy

816
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:18,120
It's my time, I need to say that

817
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,120
That's the place for you

818
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:24,120
You don't have to let me get to be who you should be

819
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:26,120
That's the place for you

820
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:30,120
I can make it through, but I don't do it anymore

821
01:14:56,120 --> 01:15:20,560
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of

822
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:24,040
the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

823
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:29,540
Um, Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music & More program. Can we talk about that?

824
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:32,040
No subject will ever be taboo.

825
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:36,040
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights?

826
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:39,040
Except, of course, the subject that was just under discussion.

827
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:45,040
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

828
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,040
I collect your fucking head.

829
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:50,040
Just like this fucker here.

830
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:52,040
What the fuck is going on here?

831
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:22,040
How's everybody doing?

832
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:27,040
I'm getting pissy because I can't find the cage match pick I want for tonight on my computer.

833
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:32,040
It's been on the whole time.

834
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:37,040
No, it's okay because it's muted. I can mute them here and then they don't go past my computer.

835
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,040
What's up?

836
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,040
Hi Rob.

837
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,040
Hi.

838
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:43,040
Rob.

839
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,040
Rob.

840
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:45,040
What?

841
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,040
Rob.

842
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:47,040
What?

843
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,040
Rob.

844
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:49,040
What?

845
01:16:49,040 --> 01:17:08,320
So did you hear about last week's cage match?

846
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:12,840
Because I didn't have a song for you, we did a reverse cage match and we nominated four

847
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:17,800
songs to be booted off the station forever and did you know that Loki chose one of his

848
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:24,800
songs to be banned from the station forever.

849
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:51,800
What would I have a problem with that note?

850
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:46,800
The first song you can vote for tonight, I would say last week's winner, but it's actually two weeks ago's winner.

851
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:51,600
It's Battle Without an Honor or Humanity, the 88 Severed Limbs mix by the one and only

852
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:52,600
Loki.

853
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:53,600
Enjoy!

854
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:57,080
You only get to hear a clip of it because it did win last week, so we'll start it about

855
01:18:57,080 --> 01:19:04,080
halfway in.

856
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:29,080
I failed all the rest, wanna raise the top ten

857
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:31,080
Stop lookin', I took you five to the right hand

858
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:33,080
Now I just need you to be the best of a black man

859
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:35,080
This wisdom wasn't made the way, so it's not planned

860
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:37,080
This hell is an actual terror

861
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:39,080
They make me move, they fight it up every day

862
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:41,080
So go and fuck it through them, they change it in like a modern parade

863
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:43,080
Don't combine, they say what the savage is, we're the only swine

864
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:45,080
This thing, there's only one spade

865
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,080
This body, I'm at the hop, I'm ready to sing him a song

866
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:49,080
I wanna run, come on, there may be no peace, no smoke

867
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:50,080
We don't need

868
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:32,080
The first song you can vote for tonight is Battle Without a Honor or Humanity, the 88-7

869
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:42,360
Limbs mix, so you can vote for that one, or you can vote for this next one, which is Jamie's

870
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:43,360
pick.

871
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:44,920
Hey, stop fighting about Para-Para.

872
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:48,320
We're trying to do a show here, hello.

873
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,320
Jamie, what song did you pick for tonight's Cade Mass?

874
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,320
I forgot. Something by Utah Saints.

875
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,320
Yes, it's FIFA 2001, actually.

876
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:58,320
I think it was done for FIFA 2001, but it's something else and I couldn't find the title again.

877
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,320
So we'll just call it FIFA 2001.

878
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:01,320
Okay.

879
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:03,320
Alright, so this is Jamie's pick for tonight's Cade Mass.

880
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:06,320
They say the title, and they end the song, though, somewhere.

881
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:07,320
Okay.

882
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:09,320
Something Hyperbeat or something.

883
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:12,320
Alright. Well, any particular reason you're picking this song?

884
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:15,320
Because I like Utah Saints, and we've never had one, so I picked one.

885
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:21,340
All right here it is second song you can vote for tonight Jamie's pick Utah Saints with FIFA 2001 enjoy

01:21:45,320 --> 01:22:13,440
Power, power, power to the beat!

01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:15,040
I like Utah Saints, it gets a 9.

902
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:44,040
p0k3smot42o I actually really did enjoy that song and I wish I would have heard it before now.

903
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:49,040
I think it was definitely a good song. I would give it an 8 or 9.

904
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:53,040
Okay. I had asked Mika what she thinks because she's on the phone, so she loses.

905
01:25:53,040 --> 01:26:00,040
Alright, so there's song number 2 you can vote for tonight. Utah Saints with Power to the People?

906
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:05,040
Beats. Power to the Beats. Power to the People!

907
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:12,040
Alright. The song I wanted to pick for tonight's Cajun Match I couldn't find and that kind of pisses me off.

908
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:46,440
I think I wasn't really listening now. What do you think of it on scale one to ten?

909
01:26:46,440 --> 01:27:03,760
I don't know. Can we listen to it again? No, we can't listen to it again.

910
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:05,760
No, it's a 1, by default.

911
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:39,440
Hey, my pick for tonight is from a new dance compilation out there.

912
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:42,640
It's Now Dance 2004 from Britain.

913
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:47,320
And this is Mel C, one of the Spice Girls, but that's okay, it's the Spice Girl that

914
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:48,320
can sing.

915
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:49,320
Baby Spice?

916
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:50,320
Sporty Spice.

917
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:51,320
The Daiki one.

918
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:52,320
Daiki Spice.

919
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,320
The one with the bad teeth?

920
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:54,320
Yes.

921
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:55,320
Oh.

922
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:56,320
They all have bad teeth.

923
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:57,320
They're British.

924
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:58,320
Just kidding.

925
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:02,160
This is the one that Did I Turn to You from DanceMania X8, which is a pretty popular song.

926
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:03,520
And this is a new single from her.

927
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:09,360

All right, that was Mel C with Yeah Yeah Yeah.

963
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:03,080
Jamie.

964
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:04,080
What?

965
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:07,440
Mel C, Yeah Yeah Yeah.

966
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:13,340
It was kind of repetitive and made me think of that Britney Spears song that's in Fifth

967
01:32:13,340 --> 01:32:14,340
Mix.

968
01:32:14,340 --> 01:32:18,340
So, no offense, but it gets like a 6.8.

969
01:32:18,340 --> 01:32:20,340
Alright, Logie.

970
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:31,340
You know, this just goes to show you, you know, they can leave the Spice Girls, but they still suck.

971
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:35,340
I don't care if she dead, I turn to you, this is crap.

972
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:38,340
It gets a 3, because it's good.

973
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:12,340
It still sucks and it gets less than a zero.

974
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:14,340
It gets less than me.

975
01:33:14,340 --> 01:33:18,340
No, that sucked. I never want to hear it again. It gets like a one.

976
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:20,340
That's it.

977
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:23,340
All right, Nico?

978
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:27,340
It's good. I give it a one.

979
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:29,340
What the hell is that?

980
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:30,340
Crack.

981
01:33:30,340 --> 01:33:34,340
Jonas, hello, but you don't get to vote on that because you didn't get to vote on the others.

982
01:33:34,340 --> 01:33:35,340
I'm sorry.

983
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:36,340
That's all right, but hello.

984
01:33:36,340 --> 01:33:37,340
How are you?

985
01:33:37,340 --> 01:33:39,340
All right.

986
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:43,380
Get ready to send your votes in over private message to Sky.

987
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:46,540
And here's the songs you can vote for tonight.

988
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:47,820
Here's a quick recap.

989
01:33:47,820 --> 01:33:50,420
Song number one, Battle Without a Honor or Humanity,

990
01:33:50,420 --> 01:33:51,620
the 88-several limb mix.

991
01:33:51,620 --> 01:33:53,080
This is a battle without a humanity.

992
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:54,540
This is a battle without a humanity.

993
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:58,140
This is a battle without a humanity.

994
01:33:58,140 --> 01:33:59,180
All right.

995
01:33:59,180 --> 01:34:00,900
Song number two you can vote for tonight

996
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:05,420
is Utah Saints with FIFA 2001, the, what the hell's

997
01:34:05,420 --> 01:34:06,100
name of it again?

998
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:07,060
Power to the Beats.

999
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:14,060
How are the beats? Thank you.

1000
01:34:15,380 --> 01:34:22,380
And song number three you can vote for tonight is Mel C with Yeah Yeah Yeah.

1001
01:34:25,820 --> 01:34:31,700
Alright, send those votes over private message now now now to Sky.

1002
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:34,980
I'm in the chat room. Hello, how are you?

1003
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:41,980
Wait, Jamie, before you get to the picture thing, because we're not ready for a break yet, I wanted to talk, because I know you wanted to talk about this earlier.

1004
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:48,980
You picked up a new game this week, you passed up Ultramix to get your Eurobeat collection, but you did get a new game this week, right?

1005
01:34:48,980 --> 01:34:50,980
Final Fantasy X-2, not X.

1006
01:34:50,980 --> 01:34:51,980
Final Fantasy X-2.

1007
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:55,980
Dear people, it's X, not X. Roll the numerals. Say it with me.

1008
01:34:55,980 --> 01:34:58,980
Ten-two.

1009
01:34:58,980 --> 01:34:59,980
Everybody?

1010
01:34:59,980 --> 01:35:00,980
X-2? Twelve?

1011
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:02,980
Is it Final Fantasy X-2?

1012
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:07,660
To piss Jamie off, I'll be calling it X2 all night long. X2? So what did you think of X2?

1013
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:09,420
I don't know. That game doesn't exist.

1014
01:35:09,420 --> 01:35:11,720
What did you think of Final Fantasy XII?

1015
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:14,820
You know, the posters for that game look pretty neat.

1016
01:35:14,820 --> 01:35:16,900
And the main character is hot.

1017
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:21,220
And actually, yes, they do have pictures of the game up on the internet now.

1018
01:35:21,220 --> 01:35:27,220
So what did you think about Final Fantasy... I mean Charlie's Angels, the game.

1019
01:35:29,220 --> 01:35:31,500
That was just like... That was great.

1020
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:38,100
I love the game. I'm having a great time with it. Although, my big disappointment came when

1021
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:43,820
they brought in my man, because in the Japanese version, my favorite voice actor is his voice,

1022
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:50,700
the guy with one leg. And his voice is okay in the US one, but I'm getting a Japanese

1023
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:58,500
one coming up probably in a month or so, so I get to hear it later. But it's not bad.

1024
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:02,980
The whole Al Bhed thing is back, you know, where you pick up the primer and everything,

1025
01:36:02,980 --> 01:36:05,940
but it doesn't really interfere with the game.

1026
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:06,940
It's pretty neat so far.

1027
01:36:06,940 --> 01:36:10,420
I'm about, I think, up on the fourth, fifth mission.

1028
01:36:10,420 --> 01:36:18,060
I'm enjoying it, although you make sure that you have plenty of healing implements and

1029
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:21,820
as much magic refill things as you can right at the beginning of the game, because it gets

1030
01:36:21,820 --> 01:36:22,820
pretty tough.

1031
01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:27,100
But the whole dress fear thing is pretty neat.

1032
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:31,120
i'll probably pick it up and play through it because i play through ten and play through

1033
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:33,240
all the other ones and

1034
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:37,180
that's what i do

1035
01:36:37,180 --> 01:36:40,280
oh yeah

1036
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:44,440
ah dark child says that at E3 they called it X2

1037
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:47,680
they're idiots

1038
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:52,720
just sayin'

1039
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:56,360
one two three four five six seven eight nine X is not actually how it is

1040
01:36:56,360 --> 01:36:59,760
i don't know if there isn't make a man they're just uh... tailgating off the

1041
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,000
uh... expert

1042
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:04,440
i don't know you see cuz i would find that person

1043
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:05,860
and shoot them in the head

1044
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:10,260
access you know i really like final fantasy v i i i

1045
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:12,280
it was really cool but

1046
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:15,720
this one's okay to you i guess

1047
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:18,400
i think everybody should get over it it's a game name

1048
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,880
but uh... thanks to uh...

1049
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:23,300
uh... to uh... link uh...

1050
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:30,060
provided by, who did I get that from? From Nikari earlier. We've got an MP3 of the English

1051
01:37:30,060 --> 01:37:33,660
opening. Yes, and I have to... We're going to need to skip forward just a little bit

1052
01:37:33,660 --> 01:37:36,620
in the MP3 because... Well, I'm going to have to unpack it first, but we'll get to that

1053
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:38,860
after everybody's review. We'll get to it after everybody's review, because I have to

1054
01:37:38,860 --> 01:37:44,060
unpack it first. Yeah, it's, you know what? They had another version of the intro, because

1055
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:48,980
they translated the intro. The one that they were going to do, oh my God, they had the

1056
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:58,380
worst singer ever. It sounded worse than the Busta Move 2 music. No, no, no, no, no. No,

1057
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:04,180
they actually had an English speaking person doing the intro, the last person, and it really

1058
01:38:04,180 --> 01:38:10,340
sucked. Kotokumi was actually pretty good, her English one, but she put very odd pauses

1059
01:38:10,340 --> 01:38:16,040
in it and so it wouldn't have worked out. Too many people would have just been really

1060
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:20,760
stupid over it and not liked it, even though her voice is absolutely awesome.

1061
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:25,320
I like her voice better than the one they got, but the final person they settled with

1062
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:29,480
though has a really nice voice and did the song justice, I thought.

1063
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:38,920
But it's still the same intro for everyone who's seen the Japanese intro.

1064
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:45,920
I'm probably pretty sure next week I'm going to have the song, Real Emotion, on our pre-show.

1065
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:56,200
Yeah, so I got to see a little bit of 10-2 yesterday, and it's interesting. I really

1066
01:38:56,200 --> 01:39:01,000
liked how there's... I mean, this is to be expected when you have a direct sequel to

1067
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,240
a Final Fantasy game, but a lot of the same areas. Like, you know, I was watching the

1068
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:07,280
beginning of the game and there's a lot of Luca in it, and so it was kind of cool to

1069
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:10,760
see like the same areas but like with these new kind of characters and

1070
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:14,400
different things I don't know I'm easily amused I guess um but the gameplay

1071
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:19,560
overall like it looks like they kept the same engine for everything outside the

1072
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:23,420
battles and then totally redid the battle engine it's that all active

1073
01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:26,920
battle yeah it's all actually really fast and they have the dress shoes and

1074
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:31,360
that's the first thing I noticed was my god the battles are fast paced Wow but

1075
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:34,820
it's pretty cool I like that I like the idea of some fast paced battles on a

1076
01:39:34,820 --> 01:39:39,500
Final Fantasy game. The dresspheres are fine. But this is, yeah, between the dresspheres

1077
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:43,940
and the whole just blatant Charlie Angel's theme, Charlie's Angels theme going on with

1078
01:39:43,940 --> 01:39:50,380
it, it is seriously, it's a cross between Final Fantasy and a Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen

1079
01:39:50,380 --> 01:39:56,820
shopping game. No! Do not insult the game with that. And then, you know, you go to these

1080
01:39:56,820 --> 01:40:01,540
towns, you're talking to people, it's like, you totally scored, like, 1,500 gills. You

1081
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:05,460
up in the chest and says, you scored Phoenix down, you know.

1082
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:11,380
And everything is awesomeness, awesome that. Oh my god, you were so awesome, you're throwing

1083
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:14,700
up a level, babe. That particular scene where they're talking

1084
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:18,780
about the awesome sphere. Girl, you know how to work that level.

1085
01:40:18,780 --> 01:40:25,780
It's just like that in the Japanese version. But I did notice some changes, like in the

1086
01:40:25,780 --> 01:40:32,180
I did notice some changes. There's, um, like, um, in the Japanese version, there's the Seagull

1087
01:40:32,180 --> 01:40:36,780
team and there's the Gullwings in the US one. That's like a little, you know, little changes

1088
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:41,900
here and there. And then they got all the same voice actors.

1089
01:40:41,900 --> 01:40:45,300
Yeah, that was pretty cool. Don't get me wrong, just because I say it's a cross between Mary

1090
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:49,380
Kay and Ashley Olsen game, I'm just, I'm poking fun at it. It really does look like a pretty

1091
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:52,780
neat game. I wish I could have, like, played it a little more, but I'm too consumed with

1092
01:40:52,780 --> 01:40:55,860
11 to give a shit about any other Final Fantasy right now.

1093
01:40:55,860 --> 01:41:00,140
Addict. So, Ragnarok is cooler. Ragnarok is cooler.

1094
01:41:00,140 --> 01:41:10,140
Yeah, and I need to beat 10 first anyway, so. Yeah, Final Fantasy X-2, not too shabby.

1095
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:15,780
It's kind of what you'd expect. It's definitely kind of made for the fanboys, although I don't

1096
01:41:15,780 --> 01:41:20,620
know, I would say it's a very great game. I should have brought it back with me.

1097
01:41:20,620 --> 01:41:25,180
But it's more for teenage girls and gay men, but that's okay.

1098
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:28,140
Fanboys will love it too because, you know, I guess they're hot or whatever.

1099
01:41:28,140 --> 01:41:29,780
It definitely gives the fan service.

1100
01:41:29,780 --> 01:41:32,540
Yeah, it's definitely for the fans.

1101
01:41:32,540 --> 01:41:35,660
That's good because they need to sell a lot of copies to make up for how much money they

1102
01:41:35,660 --> 01:41:36,660
lost on the movie.

1103
01:41:36,660 --> 01:41:41,700
Well, you know, I really, though, I really think that the different job changed just

1104
01:41:41,700 --> 01:41:42,700
a little.

1105
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:50,580
They have, like, set animations, like when you change into the singer.

1106
01:41:50,580 --> 01:41:55,540
She had the spotlight on her and the lights behind her and it dark, so it looks all dramatic.

1107
01:41:55,540 --> 01:42:01,100
Like when you change into the thief, she hops across the moon, there's a moon in the background

1108
01:42:01,100 --> 01:42:02,100
they hop across.

1109
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:09,020
When you change into the sword fighter, you see their reflection in the sword.

1110
01:42:09,020 --> 01:42:12,820
And Yuna has Tidus' sword.

1111
01:42:12,820 --> 01:42:13,820
That was really cool.

1112
01:42:13,820 --> 01:42:14,820
Yeah, it's pretty neat.

1113
01:42:14,820 --> 01:42:15,820
But it's pretty cool.

1114
01:42:15,820 --> 01:42:18,620
It actually doesn't look like it ruins a whole lot.

1115
01:42:18,620 --> 01:42:22,540
I still haven't beaten Final Fantasy X, and it hasn't really ruined a whole lot, really.

1116
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:27,740
I mean, you can kind of pick up something that must happen, but I'm kind of appreciative

1117
01:42:27,740 --> 01:42:33,060
that they didn't wreck the whole storyline to X with 10-2, you know what I mean?

1118
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:34,860
Does that make sense at all?

1119
01:42:34,860 --> 01:42:35,860
It makes sense.

1120
01:42:35,860 --> 01:42:36,860
All right.

1121
01:42:36,860 --> 01:42:39,620
What do you think, Loki?

1122
01:42:39,620 --> 01:42:41,540
You got to see the game a little bit.

1123
01:42:41,540 --> 01:42:42,540
He's running away.

1124
01:42:42,540 --> 01:42:46,180
Have you got to play 10-2 at all, Zero?

1125
01:42:46,180 --> 01:42:47,700
What did you think of what you saw?

1126
01:42:47,700 --> 01:42:52,140
a little bit and what I saw, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it or not. It just

1127
01:42:52,140 --> 01:42:55,860
looked kind of girly to me, but I saw a couple of battle scenes and I thought they looked

1128
01:42:55,860 --> 01:43:00,700
really good, so I'm definitely going to be at some point picking it up. The strategy

1129
01:43:00,700 --> 01:43:04,660
guide is really cool, especially with the limited edition one with all the artwork and

1130
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:09,660
stuff in it. Going by reading some of that strategy guide and seeing some of the stuff

1131
01:43:09,660 --> 01:43:13,500
I saw and from what other people have been telling me, I think that I actually will like

1132
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:18,940
it because I really didn't like 10 too much because it just I don't know I just didn't

1133
01:43:18,940 --> 01:43:23,500
really get with the story but it looks like this one with its more fast paced action I

1134
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:28,580
think I'll be able to keep up with it a lot more and enjoy it.

1135
01:43:28,580 --> 01:43:33,600
It really does feel though like you're coming in at the end of 10 because it's like what

1136
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:38,880
you can do is already advanced in as far as where you can go and you get choices of different

1137
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:47,080
missions you can take and it's pretty I enjoy the game okay you guys want to

1138
01:43:47,080 --> 01:43:51,880
know tonight's cage match winner all right let's unveil tonight's cage match

1139
01:43:51,880 --> 01:44:01,200
winner back to the cage match I've tallied up all the votes and and we have

1140
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:06,960
a tie in tonight's cage match yay there's a tie in tonight's cage match

1141
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:12,340
between Loki's pick battle without a honor or humanity the 88 severed

1142
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:13,340
limbs mix

1143
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:22,860
and between the Utah Saints song

1144
01:44:22,860 --> 01:44:28,740
whoops whoop that's not it

1145
01:44:28,740 --> 01:44:31,260
it's this one sorry there it is

1146
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:46,040
So we have a tie, and in that case I get to break the tie, with a hammer. Sorry you can't

1147
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:57,900
send in house votes, I'm on to you. So I get to break the tie vote. Oh wow, this is tricky.

1148
01:44:57,900 --> 01:45:02,860
There's a tie between the first and second songs tonight, and I get to break the tie.

1149
01:45:02,860 --> 01:45:09,260
And whereas, I think I do prefer Battle Without a Honor or Humanity, I didn't quite care for

1150
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:13,260
what Loki had to say about my cage match pick, so I'm choosing Jamie's cage match pick.

1151
01:45:13,260 --> 01:45:14,260
Yay!

1152
01:45:14,260 --> 01:45:19,300
Oh no, now I have to make another song, oh no.

1153
01:45:19,300 --> 01:45:26,300
I would like to vote that that goes into permanent rotation.

1154
01:45:26,300 --> 01:45:35,300
Well, okay. Sure, why not, since we're all Kill Bill fans anyway.

1155
01:45:35,300 --> 01:45:43,260
Alright, so there we go. So you'll hear both of those songs in Orange

1156
01:46:13,260 --> 01:46:16,340
We're going to play that real emotion from Final Fantasy X-2 and something else in this

1157
01:46:16,340 --> 01:46:17,340
break.

1158
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:19,820
Then when we come back, we'll do the FUs of the week.

1159
01:46:19,820 --> 01:46:21,940
We'll have to skip forward though a little bit.

1160
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:22,940
So say this-

1161
01:46:22,940 --> 01:46:25,660
But why would we play both versions?

1162
01:46:25,660 --> 01:46:27,540
We have the Japanese shortened up one?

1163
01:46:27,540 --> 01:46:30,460
Okay, so we'll play both versions then, I guess.

1164
01:46:30,460 --> 01:46:34,060
So we're going to skip forward a little bit in this MP3, so pardon us while we navigate

1165
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:36,300
this MP3 a little bit to find you the actual words.

1166
01:46:36,300 --> 01:46:40,920
So we'll hear both the English and Japanese versions of real emotion.

1167
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:43,680
And we'll be back with the FUs of the week, so send those in over private messages to

1168
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:50,680
the sky.

1169
01:47:13,680 --> 01:47:18,680
What can I do for you?

1170
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:28,680
What can I do for you?

1171
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:30,680
But I can't get in you

1172
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:35,680
What can I do for you?

1173
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:46,680
I'll be the hazy girl of my heart I can't wait for something like this

1174
01:47:46,680 --> 01:47:54,680
And now and then I don't know what to do I don't think that I can ever go back

1175
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:57,680
To the things I've seen And those hazy dreams

1176
01:47:57,680 --> 01:48:00,680
Can you tell her what I'm sayin' now?

1177
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:01,680
Hey.

1178
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:03,680
You said it'd be a good thing,

1179
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:04,680
Like a thing,

1180
01:48:04,680 --> 01:48:08,680
Like a thing.

1181
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:10,680
So, I know,

1182
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:13,680
The world up in the ocean has surrounded me.

1183
01:48:13,680 --> 01:48:16,680
I won't get into it now.

1184
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:17,680
I know,

1185
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:21,680
That 40's the only way my heart can go.

1186
01:48:21,680 --> 01:48:25,680
I hear your voice callin' out to me.

1187
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:28,080
You'll never be alone

1188
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:29,080
Can I get to you?

1189
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:32,680
Can I get to you?

1190
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:36,680
Can I get to you?

1191
01:48:39,180 --> 01:48:40,180
Can I get to you?

1192
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:44,680
Yeah, I can hear you

1193
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:51,680
And if I find the river that the moment has surrounded me

1194
01:48:51,680 --> 01:48:54,680
And I can't go on

1195
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:57,680
I'll dance the moment that I close my eyes

1196
01:48:57,680 --> 01:49:00,180
I'll fall in love's happy heart

1197
01:49:00,180 --> 01:49:03,180
I'm dancing for all of you

1198
01:49:03,180 --> 01:49:05,180
I'll never be free

1199
01:49:05,180 --> 01:49:07,180
And so I know

1200
01:49:07,180 --> 01:49:10,180
The world of good emotion has to rise

1201
01:49:10,180 --> 01:49:13,180
I won't give in to it now

1202
01:49:13,180 --> 01:49:16,180
I know that moment is the only way

1203
01:49:16,180 --> 01:49:18,180
My heart can go

1204
01:49:18,180 --> 01:49:21,180
I hear your voice calling out

1205
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:25,180
I can't hear you, you'll never be alone

1206
01:49:25,180 --> 01:49:30,180
Can I do for you? Can I do for you? Can I do for you?

1207
01:49:30,180 --> 01:49:33,180
I can't hear you

1208
01:49:33,180 --> 01:49:36,180
I can't hear you

1209
01:49:36,180 --> 01:49:46,580
What can I do for you?

1210
01:51:06,180 --> 01:51:16,180
This is the end of the video, if you want to see more videos like this, please subscribe to my channel.

1211
01:51:46,180 --> 01:52:15,940
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff

1212
01:52:15,940 --> 01:52:17,940
Do we want to be accepted by Hollywood?

1213
01:52:17,940 --> 01:52:19,940
No!

1214
01:52:19,940 --> 01:52:21,940
Do we care what people think of us?

1215
01:52:21,940 --> 01:52:23,940
No!

1216
01:52:23,940 --> 01:52:25,940
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

1217
01:52:25,940 --> 01:52:27,940
Yes!

1218
01:52:27,940 --> 01:52:31,940
Extreme Bimani Radio.

1219
01:52:31,940 --> 01:52:33,940
That's us.

1220
01:52:33,940 --> 01:52:35,940
Orange Lounge Radio.

1221
01:52:35,940 --> 01:52:37,940
Hi everybody.

1222
01:52:37,940 --> 01:52:39,940
We're back.

1223
01:52:39,940 --> 01:52:41,940
Both versions of a real motion back to back there.

1224
01:52:41,940 --> 01:52:46,940
and there's a third one out there too, Koda doing the English, but we don't have that currently.

1225
01:52:46,940 --> 01:52:49,940
We'll just have to play that later! Yep.

1226
01:52:49,940 --> 01:52:53,940
Anyway, it's about time to get into the FUs of the Week, but Jamie's not here just yet.

1227
01:52:53,940 --> 01:53:00,940
So, Loki, is there anything going on out there in the sim world you want to tell us about?

1228
01:53:00,940 --> 01:53:07,940
I guess. People are working on skins for, you know, the rest of the Bomani games like, you know, Extreme and stuff.

1229
01:53:07,940 --> 01:53:16,980
I hear Popping Music's in development for StepMania. Support for that. And, let's see,

1230
01:53:16,980 --> 01:53:23,580
what else? Oh, Keysound BMS files for 9th Style will be up on Vimeo later this week.

1231
01:53:23,580 --> 01:53:29,220
They promised it a few days ago, but they ran into some problems or something. So, those

1232
01:53:29,220 --> 01:53:33,500
will be up later on this week. So, you look for those. So, you can play 9th Style stuff

1233
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:42,520
at home without all the lag. Also on supernova.org they've got the hard drive images for some

1234
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:47,020
of the rest of the Beatmania games. Almost all of them are covered now. So if you have

1235
01:53:47,020 --> 01:53:52,700
the latest version of MAME you can play those as well. So go get those if you want to play

1236
01:53:52,700 --> 01:54:01,620
the actual arcade game of Beatmania. And yeah, there's other stuff but I can't mention the

1237
01:54:01,620 --> 01:54:09,380
other stuff too. But that's more local anyways. So, that's it. Oh, and I'm sure people are

1238
01:54:09,380 --> 01:54:14,460
going to be ripping Xbox stuff, but nothing yet. And as I mentioned last week, DDR Fever

1239
01:54:14,460 --> 01:54:23,540
stuff is available on DDRamerica.org or whatever it is, I can't remember. It's a DDR BitTorrent

1240
01:54:23,540 --> 01:54:29,420
site and you can download the craptastic songs that they have on there that's

1241
01:54:29,420 --> 01:54:39,060
about it okay well let's see I think we're about ready to get into the FUs

1242
01:54:39,060 --> 01:54:42,140
of the week so you want to send those over to me

1243
01:54:42,140 --> 01:54:51,220
Sky private message and try to limit yourselves on the FUs of the week I'm

1244
01:54:51,220 --> 01:54:54,820
getting several people who are writing me novels this week and forget it

1245
01:54:54,820 --> 01:54:58,940
i'm capping you guys after like three or four f us because it's too much

1246
01:54:58,940 --> 01:55:01,900
so um... and there's a lot of people sending them tonight so uh... send me

1247
01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:03,180
your best ones

1248
01:55:03,180 --> 01:55:05,160
uh... in the meantime

1249
01:55:05,160 --> 01:55:07,320
jamie what is the f u segment all about

1250
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:14,320
when we're pissed off and tell everyone about it.

1251
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:30,400
Um, my first F.U. of the week goes for people who are consistently negative and have

1252
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:32,520
nothing positive to say.

1253
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:36,600
Like someone who, um, never mind, I'm not naming names,

1254
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:40,400
but someone who is uh... listening right now

1255
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:42,040
now i'm not mentioning names

1256
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:43,760
they know who they are

1257
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:45,720
because trust me who always says

1258
01:55:45,720 --> 01:55:47,280
oh this sucks

1259
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:49,520
that's not my style or

1260
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:54,560
i don't like this or always negative always negative anyway

1261
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:56,100
um...

1262
01:55:56,100 --> 01:55:58,760
and everyone goes through having to go back to work

1263
01:55:58,760 --> 01:56:01,660
although honestly when i went back to work we were having a

1264
01:56:01,660 --> 01:56:05,160
thanksgiving potluck it was pretty cool

1265
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:06,220
and uh...

1266
01:56:06,220 --> 01:56:10,780
Of course, it's also no longer our busy season of the year, so we're really slow, so I've

1267
01:56:10,780 --> 01:56:14,660
got tons of time just to get stuff done and think.

1268
01:56:14,660 --> 01:56:23,660
Um, Effie goes to my cat for, uh, needing a bath, so I have to go wash my cat.

1269
01:56:23,660 --> 01:56:24,660
Um.

1270
01:56:24,660 --> 01:56:32,380
Oh, I just need to make sure that the pussy's clean.

1271
01:56:32,380 --> 01:56:35,460
Well, at least she's well-petted.

1272
01:56:35,460 --> 01:56:47,940
Anyway, another F.U. goes toward the upstairs room at my house for not being

1273
01:56:47,940 --> 01:56:53,180
cleaned so I have to clean that and I don't want to do that.

1274
01:56:53,180 --> 01:56:57,940
And then all the stupid people in California, which are most everybody.

1275
01:56:57,940 --> 01:56:58,940
Not everybody.

1276
01:56:58,940 --> 01:57:03,700
There's more people in this room I can say as an intelligent human being.

1277
01:57:03,700 --> 01:57:10,660
just everybody else though sucks and none of them can drive

1278
01:57:10,660 --> 01:57:17,580
and another one goes toward um... me for leaving my oregel at home because my tooth hurts

1279
01:57:17,580 --> 01:57:20,540
and then um...

1280
01:57:20,540 --> 01:57:24,140
I think that's about it. I'm really not full of angst today

1281
01:57:24,140 --> 01:57:25,340
oh yeah

1282
01:57:25,340 --> 01:57:26,300
ten-two

1283
01:57:26,300 --> 01:57:27,680
ten

1284
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:28,940
ten

1285
01:57:28,940 --> 01:57:33,340
not x

1286
01:57:33,340 --> 01:57:35,980
oh yeah and the other one goes towards square

1287
01:57:35,980 --> 01:57:39,780
for closing the final fantasy 11 beta

1288
01:57:39,780 --> 01:57:43,100
right before i could install my beta copy

1289
01:57:43,100 --> 01:57:46,880
square enix

1290
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:49,100
big f u to square enix

1291
01:57:49,100 --> 01:57:50,860
and then

1292
01:57:50,860 --> 01:57:58,520
a f u towards me not having more money

1293
01:57:58,520 --> 01:57:59,900
uh...

1294
01:57:59,900 --> 01:58:00,660
first one

1295
01:58:00,660 --> 01:58:01,880
well it's kind of minor

1296
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:03,320
the first one was

1297

1299
01:58:09,380 --> 01:58:12,880
you know there's a real life or a kick the goblins ass without thinking about

1300
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:13,560
it

1301
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:18,880
but this is a game so i can't do that i mean i'm a rpg haha no i'm not a file

1303
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:23,760

1304
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:25,560
and online game

01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:31,400
and i'm only having had the rule

1307

i'm not

1308
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:35,680
you break half of it you break the whole thing

1309
01:58:35,680 --> 01:58:38,240
you don't understand i'm playing it leisurely

1310
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:44,120
i'm not like i have to be on there all day cause i have to level up every day every day

1311
01:58:44,120 --> 01:58:47,220
oh my god if i'm not in this world like

1312
01:58:47,220 --> 01:58:49,000
most of my life

1313
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:50,760
i don't know what i'm gonna do i dedicate

1314
01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:55,280
i dedicate the nelson laugh to you

1315
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:58,000
uh... second f u goes to leaves

1316
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,480
i don't like leaves

1317
01:58:59,480 --> 01:59:04,000
and the fact that every single leaf that's in this apartment complex

1318
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,860
fell during one day

1319
01:59:05,860 --> 01:59:09,360
it's like it's snow outside but it's leaves

1320
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:12,860
there's just like so many leaves out there it's kind of funny because the

1321
01:59:12,860 --> 01:59:15,120
mexicans were here the day before

1322
01:59:15,120 --> 01:59:19,920
blowing off the leaves like a few leaves that were there

1323
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:23,300
and then a few years later every single leaf falls all at once

1324
01:59:23,300 --> 01:59:26,860
man i wish i could see their sad face when they come to work

1325
01:59:26,860 --> 01:59:28,120
next week

1326
01:59:28,120 --> 01:59:30,200
but i'll man

1327
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:32,580
uh... also

1328
01:59:32,580 --> 01:59:34,840
uh... at the two

1329
01:59:34,840 --> 01:59:36,560
uh...

1330
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:38,280
the parades that we had today

1331
01:59:38,280 --> 01:59:39,880
that mean that had been

1332
01:59:39,880 --> 01:59:41,640
yeah been

1333
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:44,480
that's art

1334
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:46,500
and

1335
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:50,360
i really are much of at the the people are like this

1336
01:59:50,360 --> 01:59:52,920
they're talking about michael jackson and already

1337
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:54,220
no victim of

1338
01:59:54,220 --> 01:59:56,200
no molesting his child

1339
01:59:56,200 --> 02:00:01,200
Here's my opinion on it, and you're going to listen to it anyways because I'm making you.

1340
02:00:01,200 --> 02:00:08,200
Basically, I think he's an easy target, and that they're just taking advantage of him because he's an easy target and a freak that sleeps with children.

1341
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:13,200
Now, while he may be a freak that sleeps with children, does it mean that he's groping them?

1342
02:00:13,200 --> 02:00:19,200
So, you know, I just think he's just a freak, but I think he's innocent, and yet people are like,

1343
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:22,200
I wouldn't let my kid next to that chum, Lester.

1344
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:27,200
He's been convicted. He hasn't even gone to trial yet. You haven't heard any of the details yet.

1345
02:00:27,200 --> 02:00:33,200
It's just, it's annoying. But, I hate the media, because now they're talking about this instead of Kobe Bryant.

1346
02:00:33,200 --> 02:00:41,200
And then, you know, next thing you'll hear is, like, I don't know, uh, Bob Barker will have, like, chicken heads stapled to his walls.

1347
02:00:41,200 --> 02:01:08,080
kostjamrh And you know, if something like that happened,

1348
02:01:08,080 --> 02:01:12,320
Bob Barker would have a bunch of kittens and puppies killed all in his house, and then

1349
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:16,520
he's talking about spandex and pets.

1350
02:01:16,520 --> 02:01:19,640
I just had a horrible thought, and Rod's probably going to hate me for this.

1351
02:01:19,640 --> 02:01:25,120
He's probably got the preserved corpse of Rod Roddy in the closet, so that he can open

1352
02:01:25,120 --> 02:01:30,160
it up. What would you do in this situation, Rod? What would you do?

1353
02:01:30,160 --> 02:01:40,480
I would sell it on eBay. Anyways, um, yeah, I'm done. Oh, F you to, um, Iron Chef for

1354
02:01:40,480 --> 02:01:45,360
not, like, last night we watched the, they tied, okay, so they had to go into an overcooked

1355
02:01:45,360 --> 02:01:50,400
round, and, um, they had, the first round was the potato match, which was awesome, because

1356
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:53,960
I love potatoes, so I was watching that, and then the next round was sweet potatoes. I

1357
02:01:53,960 --> 02:01:57,280
was like, you know what'd be cool? Is if they put something in there that, like, no one

1358
02:01:57,280 --> 02:02:03,120
would want to cook, like kittens. They should have the kitten Iron Chef cook off. And it

1359
02:02:03,120 --> 02:02:07,860
would be great because they'd just be like all grossed out and stuff, but they'd have

1360
02:02:07,860 --> 02:02:13,900
to create awesome dishes using kittens. Live kittens. So that's it.

1361
02:02:13,900 --> 02:02:18,100
I don't know. I still want to see the live octopus one. Like from the intro.

1362
02:02:18,100 --> 02:02:22,460
Giant alien. No. All right, I'm done.

1363
02:02:22,460 --> 02:02:23,700
Dog, force me.

1364
02:02:23,700 --> 02:02:24,700
Rob.

1365
02:02:24,700 --> 02:02:25,700
Rob.

1366
02:02:25,700 --> 02:02:29,780
Well, you might try giving me a microphone. I'd love to give some F yous

1367
02:02:31,300 --> 02:02:35,260
I have a couple of use this week F you to the power going out earlier today

1368
02:02:35,260 --> 02:02:40,520
I fucking sucked and I thought I thought you know what though F you for not staying off longer

1369
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:41,620
I wish it was still off right now

1370
02:02:41,620 --> 02:02:45,200
Then I would have had an excuse to just stay home and not do it

1371
02:02:46,580 --> 02:02:50,380
Sure, I could have just gone over to Jamie's, but I would have taken the easy way

1372
02:02:50,380 --> 02:02:52,380
I would have left me to do this by myself.

1373
02:03:20,380 --> 02:03:24,620
on it got voted out, but the show itself is still good, and next season is going to be

1374
02:03:24,620 --> 02:03:28,380
like the best television ever. So, um, you have to go to people that hate on reality

1375
02:03:28,380 --> 02:03:30,780
TV just because reality TV, because this show rules.

1376
02:03:30,780 --> 02:03:34,900
The only reason he's doing so well is all those two-year-olds watching the show. That

1377
02:03:34,900 --> 02:03:41,060
and, um, you know, the other show. Anyways, yeah, that sucked! Fucking A that he got voted

1378
02:03:41,060 --> 02:03:45,260
off, but, you know, that's alright, because, you know, vicariously through someone else,

1379
02:03:45,260 --> 02:03:49,020
he will have his revenge. You know what, I kind of view, a lot of people hate on it,

1380
02:04:19,020 --> 02:04:23,020
really hot guys like billy kidman he's hot

1381
02:04:23,020 --> 02:04:27,100
wrestling's okay it's just you know it's not my cup of tea but i don't hate on

1382
02:04:27,100 --> 02:04:29,900
wrestling just because wrestling is popular yet

1383
02:04:29,900 --> 02:04:33,980
people hate on survivor because survivor is popular so i'm saying f you

1384
02:04:33,980 --> 02:04:37,820
i don't watch wrestling because they don't wrestle against little kittens

1385
02:04:37,820 --> 02:04:41,660
god damn it i want to see the big people smash the kittens

1386
02:04:41,660 --> 02:04:47,500
is that so much to ask and to be honest i actually rather enjoy wrestling when

1387
02:04:47,500 --> 02:04:50,860
China's involved, except she's gone now, so I'm going to be a singer now.

1388
02:04:50,860 --> 02:04:54,140
And I like it when they get out the tables and the ladders.

1389
02:04:54,140 --> 02:04:55,900
That's always entertaining.

1390
02:04:55,900 --> 02:04:59,900
The teal and I like how the tables, ladders, ladders and chairs and cookie sheets.

1391
02:05:00,700 --> 02:05:02,140
I liked them.

1392
02:05:02,140 --> 02:05:05,700
I also liked how the one icon on Jamie's wrestling data

1393
02:05:05,700 --> 02:05:07,940
for some game was a little spinning ladder.

1394
02:05:07,940 --> 02:05:09,940
Yeah, on the news fight game.

1395
02:05:09,940 --> 02:05:11,540
That was cool. A ladder.

1396
02:05:11,540 --> 02:05:12,840
Yes, that rocked.

1397
02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:15,740
Anyway, let's hear from other folks in our room.

1398
02:05:15,740 --> 02:05:20,740
zer0, your FUs of the week

1399
02:05:45,740 --> 02:05:50,740
kostjamrh FU to Mortal Kombat 5 should have stopped at 3

1400
02:06:15,740 --> 02:06:20,740
kostjamrh But now they're doing Mortal Kombat 5 because they realized, oh, Deadly Alliance is kind of popular, maybe we should have put it in the arcade.

1401
02:06:20,740 --> 02:06:25,740
kostjamrh Yeah, which is absolutely ridiculous, because they should have stopped at the failure of 4.

1402
02:06:25,740 --> 02:06:30,740
kostjamrh Deadly Alliance was okay, I mean it was no Soul Calibur, but it was entertaining. It was more entertaining than a lot of fighting games I've played.

1403
02:06:30,740 --> 02:06:35,740
kostjamrh Fatalities are still cool.

1404
02:06:35,740 --> 02:06:40,740
kostjamrh Fatalities all sucked on Deadly Alliance.

1405
02:06:40,740 --> 02:06:50,740
kostjamrh They didn't even put like friendships or anything in there, because those were the funniest out of everything.

1406
02:06:50,740 --> 02:06:55,740
kostjamrh This is going to be great!

1407
02:07:20,740 --> 02:07:27,740
pikachu mix

1408
02:07:50,740 --> 02:07:58,740
Anyways, anyways, um, and the F-U-2 didn't have my right arm injured, in a way.

1409
02:07:58,740 --> 02:08:01,740
I'll show the videos later.

1410
02:08:01,740 --> 02:08:13,740
And, basically not many F-Us, except for people emailing me about the upcoming tournament I'm trying to organize for April, which I have no place at yet.

1411
02:08:13,740 --> 02:08:17,740
People saying, when is it going to be coming over? It's coming soon.

1412
02:08:17,740 --> 02:08:22,740
kostjamrh And people are issuing about bar raping vs no bar raping on PA

1413
02:08:47,740 --> 02:08:56,740
All the Final Fantasy, etcetera, etcetera, and especially the new upcoming movie of Final Fantasy Children Advent.

1414
02:08:56,740 --> 02:09:03,740
I already know, you know what, as much as I love Final Fantasy VII, I'm already convinced this movie is going to be a huge disappointment, so...

1415
02:09:03,740 --> 02:09:05,740
I'm not looking forward to it.

1416
02:09:05,740 --> 02:09:10,740
I've always seen, like, the spirits within, but all I do is throw fanboy shit, like,

1417
02:09:10,740 --> 02:09:38,020
p0k3smot42o

1418
02:09:40,740 --> 02:09:41,740
the week

1419
02:09:41,740 --> 02:09:42,740
not really

1420
02:09:42,740 --> 02:09:45,740
okay

1421
02:09:45,740 --> 02:09:50,740
then lets get on to our chair of F.U. shall we

1422
02:09:50,740 --> 02:09:53,740
Jamie would you like to enter an F.U. on behalf of Miko

1423
02:09:53,740 --> 02:09:56,740
F.U. to not having an F.U.

1424
02:09:56,740 --> 02:09:57,740
alright

1425
02:09:57,740 --> 02:10:00,740
moving on

1426
02:10:00,740 --> 02:10:03,740
what is up with this Mary Kay and Ashley DVD

1427
02:10:03,740 --> 02:10:04,740
moving on

1428
02:10:04,740 --> 02:10:08,740
Zodiac Knight would like to give an F.U. of the week to Squeenix

1429
02:10:08,740 --> 02:10:14,040
An FU of the week to Squeenix for using a sucky version of Real Emotion as the X2 opening song.

1430
02:10:14,040 --> 02:10:15,740
Okay, that version did not suck.

1431
02:10:17,240 --> 02:10:18,440
DarkHatsui would like to say,

1432
02:10:18,440 --> 02:10:20,740
F you to this cold that still hasn't gone away.

1433
02:10:21,540 --> 02:10:22,940
Jason would like to say,

1434
02:10:22,940 --> 02:10:25,940
F you to cable one while I'm happy that I can have cable.

1435
02:10:25,940 --> 02:10:29,640
It's really stupid that me and my friend are separated by four houses and one street

1436
02:10:29,640 --> 02:10:31,040
and that he can't get cable.

1437
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:31,940
Hurry the hell up.

1438
02:10:32,540 --> 02:10:35,840
Uh, fuck you, boss, name withheld, for calling me fat.

1439
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:37,940
I haven't gained a pound in quite a while.

1440
02:10:37,940 --> 02:10:43,580
Jason would also like to say fuck myself for not listening in a while and not having a reason not to listen

1441
02:10:44,060 --> 02:10:46,420
Yes, I'm the permissible fired

1442
02:10:48,300 --> 02:10:50,300
You have a microphone oh the other ferret

1443
02:10:51,860 --> 02:10:53,860
Where the hell did it go?

1444
02:10:54,140 --> 02:10:56,980
Well, then it's your fault for throwing it at me, isn't it? Oh

1445
02:10:57,620 --> 02:10:59,140
Here it is

1446
02:10:59,140 --> 02:11:03,480
Don't throw it again. All right. Yeah, if you Jason shame on you for not listening

1447
02:11:08,240 --> 02:11:12,900
DJ dark knight would like to say f you to the game attendance at my local putt-putt

1448
02:11:12,980 --> 02:11:16,720
We're not fixing the 2dx and initial d machines because the 2dx machines

1449
02:11:16,960 --> 02:11:23,760
Still have the black void on the top of the screen and can't watch the videos and the initial d machine for not fixing the two

1450
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:27,540
Player side wheel because of that I lost a match racing Friday night

1451
02:11:27,540 --> 02:11:31,540
Alright, here's a suggestion. Stop playing Initial D.

1452
02:11:31,540 --> 02:11:35,540
Hey! Here's a suggestion. Get a JPS 2 and play it at home.

1453
02:11:35,540 --> 02:11:39,540
Play Initial D at home like I do.

1454
02:11:39,540 --> 02:11:43,540
Darkchild

1455
02:11:43,540 --> 02:11:47,540
DD Archaholic, I don't know. I think it's Darkchild sending most of these FUs but they keep

1456
02:11:47,540 --> 02:11:51,540
switching their name back and forth. Darkchild likes to say FU to people who call

1457
02:11:51,540 --> 02:11:55,540
others stupid for saying things differently than they do. FU to

1458
02:11:55,540 --> 02:11:59,180
people who act one way and bitch at others for doing it themselves. F U to the cat shit

1459
02:11:59,180 --> 02:12:05,900
smell creeping in on me and F U to Polar Boy of Game Stop Arden, whatever that means. S

1460
02:12:05,900 --> 02:12:11,180
Ghost would like to say, F U to my job for being bipolar. Last week they scheduled me

1461
02:12:11,180 --> 02:12:17,500
less than 10 hours and this week they scheduled me 30 plus before schedule changes. My boss

1462
02:12:17,500 --> 02:12:21,980
and his wife are morons, they should learn how to schedule before starting a business.

1463
02:12:21,980 --> 02:12:25,980
F you to my dreams. I'm sick of being a secret service member for a bag of salad.

1464
02:12:25,980 --> 02:12:27,980
What?

1465
02:12:27,980 --> 02:12:31,980
I'm sick of being a secret service member for a bag of salad.

1466
02:12:31,980 --> 02:12:33,980
Okay.

1467
02:12:33,980 --> 02:12:37,980
Oddly enough I always die at the end. I think Freud would have a field day with me.

1468
02:12:37,980 --> 02:12:42,980
F you to anyone who thinks I'm a pervert now. I was making a reference to an earlier statement like

1469
02:12:42,980 --> 02:12:47,980
that tits equal veto power. I'm not sexist and I'm sorry if anyone thought I was.

1470
02:12:47,980 --> 02:12:50,980
But, but, but, but they do.

1471
02:12:50,980 --> 02:13:04,980
FU to my clothes washer having an electrical fire leaving my clothes soaking in water

1472
02:13:04,980 --> 02:13:08,980
FU to this freaking wait for Phantasy Star Online Episode 3

1473
02:13:08,980 --> 02:13:12,980
FU to everyone who can't time attack on Phantasy Star Online Challenge Mode

1474
02:13:12,980 --> 02:13:15,980
I quit P.S.O.

1475
02:13:42,980 --> 02:13:46,820
would like to say F you to people who accuse me of cheating on ultra mix it's

1476
02:13:46,820 --> 02:13:55,420
not my fault that you can't be as great as an arrow-smashing fairy as I am from

1477
02:13:55,420 --> 02:14:01,500
one arrow-smashing fairy to another you show them who's boss DJ Specter would

1478
02:14:01,500 --> 02:14:05,660
like to say F you to my Spanish teacher F you to Sam's Club for not having the

1479
02:14:05,660 --> 02:14:10,300
digital camera they supposedly had F you to school and F you to optical illusions

1480
02:14:10,300 --> 02:14:16,300
and that's for minst would like to say fu to teen night at the ddr place by my house

1481
02:14:16,300 --> 02:14:20,700
home from college for break and i forgot they did that on fridays the place was filled with

1482
02:14:20,700 --> 02:14:26,220
various small children acting even more stupid than usual minst would also like to say fu

1483
02:14:26,220 --> 02:14:29,900
to people who angst over initial d i've seen it for the first time and it's not a pretty

1484
02:14:29,900 --> 02:14:36,520
sight oh yes an fu to being on dial-up for 10 days and fu to the people in the general

1485
02:14:36,520 --> 02:14:42,240
area where I live, as for some reason they've decided it's now popular to golf, almost like

1486
02:14:42,240 --> 02:14:43,240
five years ago.

1487
02:14:43,240 --> 02:14:44,240
Anyway.

1488
02:14:44,240 --> 02:14:45,240
That's like early 80s.

1489
02:14:45,240 --> 02:14:46,240
I know.

1490
02:14:46,240 --> 02:14:50,620
Angel would like to say, I can't give you my FU as much as I'd like to, but here we

1491
02:14:50,620 --> 02:14:51,620
go.

1492
02:14:51,620 --> 02:14:52,620
I don't, I don't.

1493
02:14:52,620 --> 02:14:56,520
Oh, she's trying to omit names and stuff.

1494
02:14:56,520 --> 02:15:00,600
FU to friends hanging out with enemies and expecting me to be cool with it.

1495
02:15:00,600 --> 02:15:02,280
Stop trying to think that I'm friends with you still.

1496
02:15:02,280 --> 02:15:03,280
I'm over it.

1497
02:15:33,280 --> 02:15:38,280
I slept at around 4 a.m. and forced myself to wake up around 6 a.m. to take my cousin to school.

1498
02:15:38,280 --> 02:15:43,280
F.U. to name-changing in some of the games and anime in general. I know there are some good name-changes,

1499
02:15:43,280 --> 02:15:46,280
but they should at least be a good reason for it.

1500
02:15:46,280 --> 02:15:51,280
Lastly, F.U. to the tourists who visit the Adventure Dome who break the Bomani machines and act like idiots.

1501
02:15:51,280 --> 02:15:56,280
Okay, that's it.

1502
02:15:56,280 --> 02:15:59,280
Oh, Miko thought of an F.U.

1503
02:15:59,280 --> 02:16:19,280
kostjamrh I would have to say F U to the people who don't wear seatbelts, because Hailey, something from my school, just passed away because she did not wear a seatbelt.

1504
02:16:19,280 --> 02:16:27,280
And she was driving in the pouring rain and speeding, without a seat belt.

1505
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:32,280
So she lost out of control and she crashed into some other cars.

1506
02:16:32,280 --> 02:16:35,280
And she's dead.

1507
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:39,280
Well, that's Darwinism for you.

1508
02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:40,280
What?

1509
02:16:40,280 --> 02:16:41,280
Sorry.

1510
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:45,280
Well, hard lesson learned unfortunately, that's too bad.

1511
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:46,280
Wow.

1512
02:16:46,280 --> 02:16:48,280
At least she wasn't drunk.

1513
02:16:48,280 --> 02:16:53,280
At least she wasn't drunk and driving, because that's even worse if you ask me.

1514
02:16:55,280 --> 02:16:58,280
You throw like a girl, Jonas! I'm just kidding.

1515
02:16:58,280 --> 02:17:00,280
Okay, okay, I don't know.

1516
02:17:00,280 --> 02:17:02,280
Right here.

1517
02:17:02,280 --> 02:17:04,280
For somebody else, F you.

1518
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:06,280
Ah, blow me.

1519
02:17:06,280 --> 02:17:07,280
Alright.

1520
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:08,280
Alright.

1521
02:17:08,280 --> 02:17:09,280
Thanks.

1522
02:17:09,280 --> 02:17:10,280
Wow.

1523
02:17:10,280 --> 02:17:12,280
He does it again and the sun steps on the corner.

1524
02:17:12,280 --> 02:17:14,280
I wish it was that easy.

1525
02:17:14,280 --> 02:17:17,280
I wish I could just walk it up to some, you know, cute guy.

1526
02:17:17,280 --> 02:17:24,280
me

1527
02:17:47,280 --> 02:17:55,960
We are going to take a little breaky break here, and when we come back, we're going to

1528
02:17:55,960 --> 02:18:01,120
play some more Ultramix, I think, and we're also going to do some Ask Orange Lounge. How's

1529
02:18:01,120 --> 02:18:09,600
that sound, kids? Sound like fun? Yes, I thought so. All right, so we'll take a break, and

1530
02:18:09,600 --> 02:18:15,040
we'll be right back. You can send those questions for Ask Orange Lounge now to me, Skye, in

1531
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:22,040
in the chatroom.

1532
02:18:45,040 --> 02:18:54,040
Tell me that you want me Tell me that you need me

1533
02:18:54,040 --> 02:19:02,040
Tell me that you want me Tell me that you love me

1534
02:19:02,040 --> 02:19:09,040
I'll be your dream Be my fantasy

1535
02:19:09,040 --> 02:19:17,040
I'll be your dream, you'll be my fantasy

1536
02:19:17,040 --> 02:19:34,040
I'll be your dream, I'll be your dream

1537
02:19:34,040 --> 02:19:39,040
I'll be your dream

1538
02:19:39,040 --> 02:19:44,040
You'll be my fantasy

1539
02:19:44,040 --> 02:19:47,040
Yeah

1540
02:19:47,040 --> 02:19:50,040
Let the dream come true

1541
02:19:50,040 --> 02:19:52,040
Let the dream come true

1542
02:19:52,040 --> 02:19:56,040
Let the dream control your mind

1543
02:19:56,040 --> 02:19:59,040
A little bit of ecstasy

1544
02:23:26,040 --> 02:23:53,200
Hello, and welcome back everybody to Orange Launch Radio, Episode 70, our season 4 premiere.

1545
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:58,400
A few programming notes, things we need to tell you guys about, Vanilla Sky is going

1546
02:23:58,400 --> 02:24:01,820
to be moving, it's not going to be on Monday nights anymore, it's going to be on Wednesday

1547
02:24:01,820 --> 02:24:02,820
nights.

1548
02:24:02,820 --> 02:24:06,340
Those of you who are listening to the show this week know that Lanky Style got a brand

1549
02:24:06,340 --> 02:24:10,360
new job, which he started tonight, best of luck to him, but it's going to require that

1550
02:24:10,360 --> 02:24:14,600
he is not available Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday nights, so instead we're going to move the

1551
02:24:14,600 --> 02:24:19,800
show to Wednesday so he can still be a part of it, because they've been really good on

1552
02:24:19,800 --> 02:24:24,940
show and we've talked about a lot of interesting game things and non game

1553
02:24:24,940 --> 02:24:30,060
things so if you haven't tuned into that you should also back live this week on

1554
02:24:30,060 --> 02:24:36,300
Tuesday is my show pump up the volume the unappreciated pump up the volume

1555
02:24:36,300 --> 02:24:42,360
hit hit pre show at 7 show starts at 730 hang out in the chat room if you make a

1556
02:24:42,360 --> 02:24:48,220
request if I have it I'll play it it's that easy and make sure that like you

1557
02:24:48,220 --> 02:24:53,980
You get 20 people to sign in and listen to me this time, or I'll cry.

1558
02:24:53,980 --> 02:24:56,980
Okay.

1559
02:24:56,980 --> 02:25:01,140
Some of you may be asking yourselves, well, if Vanilla Sky is moving to Wednesdays, what's

1560
02:25:01,140 --> 02:25:02,780
happening to Livewire?

1561
02:25:02,780 --> 02:25:08,080
Well, I guess Loki would be best to answer that question, but I'll kind of answer it

1562
02:25:08,080 --> 02:25:09,080
for him.

1563
02:25:09,080 --> 02:25:11,780
He's going to be doing some intermittent stuff on Monday nights from now on.

1564
02:25:11,780 --> 02:25:15,580
He doesn't really want to go through the effort to make a new Livewire every single week,

1565
02:25:15,580 --> 02:25:18,160
because believe it or not, it's a lot of work.

1566
02:25:18,160 --> 02:25:24,720
easier than just turn on the microphones and throw on some music like the rest of us do.

1567
02:25:24,720 --> 02:25:31,080
So he's just going to do some stuff for Mondays intermittently and hopefully we'll still have

1568
02:25:31,080 --> 02:25:35,080
some special programming for you guys on Monday night.

1569
02:25:35,080 --> 02:25:37,200
Condition Zero will be back one of these days, won't it?

1570
02:25:37,200 --> 02:25:39,440
I unlocked the new BLT one.

1571
02:25:39,440 --> 02:25:41,400
Condition Zero will be back one of these days, won't it Zero?

1572
02:25:41,400 --> 02:25:42,400
Yes?

1573
02:25:42,400 --> 02:25:43,400
Yeah.

1574
02:25:43,400 --> 02:25:44,400
Yes, yes, yes.

1575
02:25:44,400 --> 02:25:45,400
All right, good.

1576
02:25:45,400 --> 02:25:46,400
All right, as promised, let's go back over to UltraMix.

1577
02:25:46,400 --> 02:25:47,400
mix.

1578
02:25:47,400 --> 02:25:48,400
Alright, it's unlocked.

1579
02:25:48,400 --> 02:25:55,400
They've just unlocked BLT style, so let's hear this, let's play, ooh this might be too

1580
02:25:55,400 --> 02:25:58,400
loud, sorry guys.

1581
02:25:58,400 --> 02:26:11,400
Well yeah, so it did on a fourth style.

1582
02:26:11,400 --> 02:26:13,400
Alright, play it

1583
02:26:41,400 --> 02:26:54,400
Of course, it sped up just like you would have thought it would.

1584
02:26:54,400 --> 02:26:55,400
Huh?

1585
02:26:55,400 --> 02:26:56,400
Yeah, a little bit.

1586
02:26:56,400 --> 02:26:58,400
Yeah, a little bit.

1587
02:26:58,400 --> 02:27:03,400
It's spelled out the same way that they're in 4th style.

1588
02:27:28,400 --> 02:27:52,400
namagem1

1589
02:27:52,400 --> 02:27:57,400
namagem1- I like this song a lot

1590
02:28:00,400 --> 02:28:05,400
namagem1- I'm hoping they didn't fuck it up

1591
02:28:02,400 --> 02:28:07,400
namagem1- I love the way it plays

1592
02:28:10,400 --> 02:28:15,400
namagem1- I love that song

1593
02:28:12,400 --> 02:28:17,400
namagem1- I'm hoping they didn't fuck it up

1594
02:28:17,400 --> 02:28:22,400
justdrop- I'm hoping they didn't fuck it up, but apparently zero says they have

1595
02:28:52,400 --> 02:28:57,400
dukeofthebump

1596
02:29:22,400 --> 02:29:31,400
p0k3smot42o have you noticed any new katas?

1597
02:29:31,400 --> 02:29:40,400
p0k3smot42o i think castle in the sky isnt a kata

1598
02:29:40,400 --> 02:29:45,400
p0k3smot42o on doubles i know it is on singles i know it is

1599
02:29:45,400 --> 02:29:52,400
kostjamrh What I don't like is that they rip the background from Fantasy from Max 2, the one by Lockout. It's a total rip-off of that background. Completely ripped off.

1600
02:30:15,400 --> 02:30:22,400
And the background is a castle in the sky, go figure.

1601
02:30:45,400 --> 02:31:04,960
I was expecting there to be a slow down there, but no.

1602
02:31:04,960 --> 02:31:10,480
It slowed down marginally, it's still slowing down.

1603
02:31:10,480 --> 02:31:11,480
Lots of freezes.

1604
02:31:11,480 --> 02:31:16,480
no it's a consistent tempo change like with insertion

1605
02:31:27,480 --> 02:31:32,480
yeah you usually don't see 16th note runs like that in licensed ones

1606
02:31:32,480 --> 02:31:34,480
Yeah, there's been quite a few in this.

1607
02:31:34,480 --> 02:31:53,840
some strange gallops there

1608
02:31:53,840 --> 02:32:16,040
And some folks wanted to hear the Metal Gear one, so we'll play that too.

1609
02:32:16,040 --> 02:32:24,040
We are playing a DDR Ultra MX-8 on Orange Pond's radio.

1610
02:32:24,040 --> 02:32:31,040
Oh, this isn't the one I was thinking it was.

1611
02:32:31,040 --> 02:32:32,040
This is the one that was...

1612
02:32:32,040 --> 02:32:39,040
the one from 6 and Core, home version

1613
02:33:02,040 --> 02:33:09,040
I'm kind of surprised this is only a 7, it's a little more 8-ish.

1614
02:33:32,040 --> 02:33:34,040
to me, especially with the 16th in it. Oh, it is an 8?

1615
02:33:34,040 --> 02:33:36,040
This doesn't look that hard at all.

1616
02:33:36,040 --> 02:33:38,040
I'm sorry, this looks more like a 6.

1617
02:33:38,040 --> 02:33:40,040
It doesn't look hard to us.

1618
02:33:40,040 --> 02:33:42,040
We're kind of jaded because we've beaten, you know,

1619
02:33:42,040 --> 02:33:44,040
Cat and stuff, but usually songs,

1620
02:33:44,040 --> 02:33:46,040
once they get 16th notes in them and stuff,

1621
02:33:46,040 --> 02:33:48,040
they're 8.

1622
02:33:48,040 --> 02:33:50,040
So that's all that surprises me.

1623
02:33:50,040 --> 02:33:52,040
I would honestly rank this song a 7.

1624
02:33:56,040 --> 02:33:58,040
But if they're opposing, they're easy to do.

1625
02:33:58,040 --> 02:34:00,040
If it's just

1626
02:34:00,040 --> 02:34:03,040
The same step being repeated, it's easy.

1627
02:34:30,040 --> 02:34:36,040
The only song that has a music video to it is the one with the half naked men in it.

1628
02:34:36,040 --> 02:34:39,040
The Maasai one, do that thing.

1629
02:34:39,040 --> 02:34:43,040
That was the only one.

1630
02:34:43,040 --> 02:34:49,040
So is that it for Ultramix? Do you guys want to play one more or what?

1631
02:34:49,040 --> 02:34:52,040
Okay, I'm going to do Keep Your Body Movin' by Spaghetti.

1632
02:34:52,040 --> 02:34:54,040
Yeah, I played that one.

1633
02:34:54,040 --> 02:34:58,040
Oh yeah, yeah, you did that one. We're going to do the There For You.

1634
02:34:58,040 --> 02:35:22,800
p0k3smot42o

1635
02:35:22,800 --> 02:35:28,080
It starts getting all jittery and crap, and it's like it's trying to load everything up

1636
02:35:28,080 --> 02:35:31,700
Which it's the Xbox and it should be able to do it, but I'm really slow at songs

1637
02:35:31,700 --> 02:35:34,480
It's almost like it starts the arrow starts shaking

1638
02:35:34,480 --> 02:35:39,480
It has the solo dogs.

1639
02:35:39,480 --> 02:35:44,480
You know what? I don't like free zeroes. I don't like free zeroes.

1640
02:35:44,480 --> 02:35:49,480
Free zeroes are good when used in moderation.

1641
02:35:49,480 --> 02:35:54,480
Yeah, there are too many

1642
02:35:54,480 --> 02:35:59,480
thejadedmieu 3 zeroes are good when used in moderation

1643
02:35:59,480 --> 02:36:04,480
kostjamrh Yeah, the too many ones were just excessive on the free zeroes. And the thing is, I don't play with free zeroes anyway because of my ankle.

1644
02:36:04,480 --> 02:36:08,480
Too many ones were just excessive on the free zeroes.

1645
02:36:08,480 --> 02:36:12,480
And the thing is, I don't play with free zeroes anyway because of my angle.

1646
02:36:12,480 --> 02:36:16,480
Anytime I'm there, I'll be there with you

1647
02:36:19,480 --> 02:36:23,480
Anytime I do what we do

1648
02:36:23,480 --> 02:36:28,480
Anytime we do what we do

1649
02:36:29,480 --> 02:36:31,480
Anytime, anytime

1650
02:36:31,480 --> 02:36:50,920
Weee, that was fun. That song did not excite me. That song was very familiar. No, it's

1651
02:36:50,920 --> 02:37:04,400
want to eat you up. Alright. No, I'm thinking the 2DX video because for the run for let's

1652
02:37:04,400 --> 02:37:10,000
talk it over. I'm going to, I'm going to fade out UltraMix there and we're going to take

1653
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:13,160
a quick break and when we come back we're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge and then

1654
02:37:13,160 --> 02:37:20,920
wrap up the show, okay guys? So we will be right back, everybody. I'm just going to cue

1655
02:37:20,920 --> 02:37:22,920
up some music. Jamie, what did you want to hear this break?

1656
02:37:22,920 --> 02:37:27,920
The old Metal Gear one. The old Metal Gear one. So we will hear that

1657
02:37:27,920 --> 02:37:34,920
right now. We'll be back. Thanks for tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio.

1658
02:38:27,920 --> 02:38:44,920
Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Can you hear what I'm saying?

1659
02:38:44,920 --> 02:38:47,920
I'm gonna jam the chicken man, they'll watch it back

1660
02:38:47,920 --> 02:38:50,920
I'm gonna kill ass, beat him, kill him all

1661
02:38:50,920 --> 02:38:59,920
Down, what am I gonna do?

1662
02:38:59,920 --> 02:39:03,920
Have you ever seen a cool game like this?

1663
02:39:03,920 --> 02:39:05,920
Here

1664
02:39:33,920 --> 02:39:38,920
And why? Leave me alone so many days

1665
02:39:38,920 --> 02:39:41,920
Just to get up in so many nights

1666
02:39:41,920 --> 02:39:47,920
Leave me alone and run, run, run

1667
02:39:47,920 --> 02:39:49,920
Tell me why

1668
02:39:54,920 --> 02:39:56,920
Tell me why

1669
02:40:56,920 --> 02:41:16,920
If you feel my heart, but you feel this is mine And it means you better stay behind, my love

1670
02:41:16,920 --> 02:41:22,920
It's the dance of your soul, that you try to relieve You'll never undo your heart emotion

1671
02:41:22,920 --> 02:41:24,920
Feel it, feel it, baby

Dance to the heartbeat

1685
02:42:13,920 --> 02:42:41,160
We're going to MP3 Pro soon, probably over Thanksgiving, so don't be surprised if you

1686
02:42:41,160 --> 02:42:46,380
hear a lot about how we've gone mp3 pro that means all that means is that if you

1687
02:42:46,380 --> 02:42:51,440
have a special codec installed on your mp3 player that you will be able to hear

1688
02:42:51,440 --> 02:42:57,200
DSL quality streaming at a dial-up standard so on the bitrate for the

1689
02:42:57,200 --> 02:42:59,960
station will go up a little bit but it'll still be modem friendly for those

1690
02:42:59,960 --> 02:43:06,520
who on thirty three six and fifty what is it fifty six K thirty five okay you'll

1691
02:43:06,520 --> 02:43:14,960
will be fine. If you're on 28.8 though, fucking A. Upgrade. Fuck. Ten bucks for a 56k modem.

1692
02:43:14,960 --> 02:43:22,840
I will buy you a modem. If you are seriously on 28.8 still, fucking email us at orangeloungeradioatyahoo.com

1693
02:43:22,840 --> 02:43:26,920
so we may mock you openly. It'll take them an hour to email us, Rob. Yeah, it'll take

1694
02:43:26,920 --> 02:43:31,000
them an hour to email us. But if you're on 33.6 or 56k, you'll still be fine. But the

1695
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:38,000
bit rate will be up a little bit.

1696
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:08,060
I sure don't think so as long as Jamie's around she's gonna dry me nuts of that fucking ferret until I set it on fire

1697
02:44:09,440 --> 02:44:11,440
All right

1698
02:44:12,240 --> 02:44:15,360
Question number one tonight from zodiac night

1699
02:44:16,940 --> 02:44:24,580
What bimani songs of those that were never released on any DDR mix before so what bimani songs not on a DDR mix yet

1700
02:44:24,580 --> 02:44:29,580
Would you guys and gals like to see come out in future downloads for Ultrix?

1701
02:44:54,580 --> 02:44:59,280
speaking of official though the safari

1702
02:44:59,280 --> 02:45:03,440

1703
02:45:03,440 --> 02:45:04,120
powered

1704
02:45:04,120 --> 02:45:08,020
bad bye baby balloon is already in ddr he asks for ones that are already in ddr

1705
02:45:08,020 --> 02:45:10,660

1706
02:45:10,660 --> 02:45:13,900
okay so you want bad bye baby balloon as an ultramix download but

1707
02:45:13,900 --> 02:45:16,940
but um... we're talking songs that haven't already been in ddr that are in

1708
02:45:16,940 --> 02:45:19,280
some abamani game that's the deal

1709
02:45:19,280 --> 02:45:20,780
there you go

1710
02:45:20,780 --> 02:45:23,060
yeah like star mine there's one

1711
02:45:23,060 --> 02:45:24,060
Instant Love.

1712
02:45:24,060 --> 02:45:25,060
Okay.

1713
02:45:25,060 --> 02:45:29,060
My pick would be Power Dream, from 9th Style, because I fucking love that song.

1714
02:45:29,060 --> 02:45:35,260
Or just about anything in Kiryamoka, please, Bitmania, Love Me Do, would be fucking the

1715
02:45:35,260 --> 02:45:36,260
shit.

1716
02:45:36,260 --> 02:45:41,100
Showa, the 9th Style, the other 9th Style one that's not Lion Suki, but Lion Suki would

1717
02:45:41,100 --> 02:45:42,100
be good too.

1718
02:45:42,100 --> 02:45:43,100
So just about anything in Kiryamoka.

1719
02:45:43,100 --> 02:45:44,100
No.

1720
02:45:44,100 --> 02:45:45,100
Panorama.

1721
02:45:45,100 --> 02:45:47,980
Or Goonies Are Good Enough, from Popin' 10, please.

1722
02:45:47,980 --> 02:45:48,980
Thank you.

1723
02:45:48,980 --> 02:45:49,980
Panorama.

1724
02:45:49,980 --> 02:45:50,980
Yes.

1725
02:45:50,980 --> 02:45:54,980
Anybody else have a thought for Bomani Songs for Ultramix Download?

1726
02:45:55,980 --> 02:46:03,980
I think it would be cool to either see Traces, either the original or the remix, or to see...

1727
02:46:04,980 --> 02:46:08,980
I can't think of it right now. Crap, I went blank.

1728
02:46:08,980 --> 02:46:10,980
But it would be cool to see a good QQQ.

1729
02:46:10,980 --> 02:46:13,980
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, Rizlim. Rizlim, please. Rizlim.

1730
02:46:13,980 --> 02:46:21,980
Okay. Wouldn't it be cool if we knew someone that could make an upgrade for an arcade cabinet

1731
02:46:21,980 --> 02:46:25,980
and they could put all these songs in there?

1732
02:46:25,980 --> 02:46:30,980
That would be cool. Yeah, that would be fucking great. Let Xplosive answer the question.

1733
02:46:30,980 --> 02:46:37,900
Let's see, what songs for the Bebop? Let me see, like, there's some songs from dusinfos.com

1734
02:46:37,900 --> 02:46:44,660
that seem good, like the V-Techno remix, or the Abyss, the Heavens mix. That would sound

1735
02:46:44,660 --> 02:46:45,660
good.

1736
02:46:45,660 --> 02:46:51,540
Cool. I like 23rd Magus's idea, you should too, Jamie. Schlagwerk.

1737
02:46:51,540 --> 02:46:52,540
Oh, Schlagwerk.

1738
02:46:52,540 --> 02:46:59,620
How about Schlagwerk? You know what? Fuck 2DX, let's put some Loki remixes in a DDR

1739
02:46:59,620 --> 02:47:04,900
he's got some pretty sweet ones miko you have an idea um i like monkey dance monkey dance yeah and

1740
02:47:04,900 --> 02:47:10,580
i also like uh what is it called deadline oh deadline would be a good one yeah deadline would

1741
02:47:10,580 --> 02:47:20,100
be great beauty of silence all right cool thanks okay let's go on to the next question shall we

1742
02:47:20,740 --> 02:47:26,420
um didi or dark child has a question for me because it says didi alcoholic right now but

1743
02:47:26,420 --> 02:47:33,420
Question for me, how long is it really limp and fully extended?

1744
02:47:36,960 --> 02:47:43,460
Ozzero is going to answer this, I don't know how he knows the answer but he wants to answer

1745
02:47:43,460 --> 02:47:44,080
this.

1746
02:47:44,080 --> 02:47:48,660
Well if I bend at the elbow it's about a foot long.

1747
02:47:48,660 --> 02:47:51,540
God damn it, you stole my joke.

1748
02:47:51,540 --> 02:47:53,540
If I put my arm straight out, it's about...

1749
02:47:53,540 --> 02:47:55,160
I would say kind of limp.

1750
02:47:55,160 --> 02:47:59,860
My finger is about two and a half inches, and when I fully extend that middle finger,

1751
02:47:59,860 --> 02:48:04,820
as I'm doing right now, when I fully extend that middle finger, I think I'm hitting a

1752
02:48:04,820 --> 02:48:06,180
good three inches there.

1753
02:48:06,180 --> 02:48:14,140
It's not about the size of the boat, it's about the motion in the ocean.

1754
02:48:14,140 --> 02:48:17,620
It's as big as you can airbrush it.

1755
02:48:17,620 --> 02:48:23,300
John Fields would like to know, will you please play my remix of Air for everyone to hear?

1756
02:48:23,300 --> 02:48:25,980
No.

1757
02:48:25,980 --> 02:48:28,300
Maybe in the after birth.

1758
02:48:28,300 --> 02:48:31,980
S Ghost would like to know, do you know why all the release dates for Ultramix are screwed

1759
02:48:31,980 --> 02:48:33,080
up?

1760
02:48:33,080 --> 02:48:34,980
I didn't know they were screwed up, I thought the game...

1761
02:48:34,980 --> 02:48:36,820
Let's say thank you to Microsoft.

1762
02:48:36,820 --> 02:48:41,780
Let's ask the guy that works at GameStop.

1763
02:48:41,780 --> 02:48:42,780
I believe you.

1764
02:48:42,780 --> 02:48:43,780
I'm sorry.

1765
02:48:43,780 --> 02:48:47,180
No, it's actually not that the release dates were messed up.

1766
02:48:47,180 --> 02:48:52,580
Since they, at the last minute, announced, basically about four days before they decided

1767
02:48:52,580 --> 02:48:57,220
to do it, that instead of being out on December 3rd, it was actually going to be out with

1768
02:48:57,220 --> 02:49:02,300
the pad and the game packaged, it was going to be out on the 18th. It was kind of something

1769
02:49:02,300 --> 02:49:08,740
they didn't really push out. And then, as far as I know, check it, December 3rd has

1770
02:49:08,740 --> 02:49:10,260
always been

1771
02:49:10,260 --> 02:49:16,760
the original release date

1772
02:49:16,760 --> 02:49:20,820
I'm getting yelled at for not answering that limp question honestly

1773
02:49:20,820 --> 02:49:22,200
uh...

1774
02:49:22,200 --> 02:49:24,620
let's see micro flaccid

1775
02:49:24,620 --> 02:49:28,700
Nince would like to know, this is a good question being asked by Nince here

1776
02:49:28,700 --> 02:49:33,540
why oh why are Magus's jokes so horribly bad?

1777
02:49:33,540 --> 02:49:35,720
okay

1778
02:49:35,720 --> 02:49:40,040
look at the originator of the jokes

1779
02:49:40,040 --> 02:49:42,520
and the amount of the true sense of humor

1780
02:49:42,520 --> 02:49:43,720
you're so mean

1781
02:49:43,720 --> 02:49:47,880
i know i am that's why i'm here

1782
02:49:47,880 --> 02:49:51,440
it's just like you have to understand your place in this world i wasn't meant

1783
02:49:51,440 --> 02:49:52,600
to sing

1784
02:49:52,600 --> 02:49:54,320
so i try not to

1785
02:49:54,320 --> 02:49:59,620
he wasn't meant to be funny so he should try not to

1786
02:49:59,620 --> 02:50:02,840
see it's really cool you gotta look at it this way

1787
02:50:02,840 --> 02:50:07,000
his jokes are so bad because he takes all that power from his freestyling

1788
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,200
and he puts it into his jokes

1789
02:50:09,200 --> 02:50:11,600
and it just makes him so bad

1790
02:50:11,600 --> 02:50:17,240
that i mean you know you can't help but say how horrible they are

1791
02:50:17,240 --> 02:50:20,720
speaking of freestyling, imagine how he's gonna

1792
02:50:20,720 --> 02:50:26,720
i wonder what the judge is gonna say if he even participates in the tournaments

1793
02:50:26,720 --> 02:50:30,120
go ahead jonas

1794
02:50:30,120 --> 02:50:31,960
that's all i gotta say

1795
02:50:31,960 --> 02:50:33,960
i guess no comment

1796
02:50:33,960 --> 02:50:38,960
you're saying fuck you to jamie when i'm the one who just totally like

1797
02:50:38,960 --> 02:50:42,960
buffer there are thirty second don't forget there are about a minute

1798
02:50:42,960 --> 02:50:44,320
i was gonna say you know

1799
02:50:44,320 --> 02:50:46,080
alright

1800
02:50:46,080 --> 02:50:49,440
uh... but you know what in all seriousness he's a good sport for putting up with our

1801
02:50:49,440 --> 02:50:51,640
shit cause we're really fucking mean to him

1802
02:50:51,640 --> 02:50:57,400
uh... i swear just translated into portuguese and he'll be hilarious

1803
02:50:57,400 --> 02:51:02,840
Even funnier if you choose to read it.

1804
02:51:02,840 --> 02:51:05,240
Okay.

1805
02:51:05,240 --> 02:51:07,120
Moving on. Shit happens.

1806
02:51:07,120 --> 02:51:10,240
Twenty-third of the night goes to everyone.

1807
02:51:10,240 --> 02:51:16,040
Yeah, shit happens, but eventually you flash.

1808
02:51:16,040 --> 02:51:21,440
DarkTetsuya would like to know, did Jamie ever get to hear QQQAZAR, and if so,

1809
02:51:21,440 --> 02:51:23,180
what were her thoughts on it?

1810
02:51:23,180 --> 02:51:27,380
There's two versions. There's the one that Angel did and there's the one that Loki did.

1811
02:51:27,380 --> 02:51:30,160
So there's two versions and she's heard neither one.

1812
02:51:30,160 --> 02:51:32,360
No that I ever have, yeah.

1813
02:51:32,360 --> 02:51:36,280
So, maybe we'll send them to her later.

1814
02:51:36,280 --> 02:51:40,040
Let's see...

1815
02:51:40,040 --> 02:51:41,880
DJ Dark Knight.

1816
02:51:41,880 --> 02:51:45,720
Oh, he has DJ in his name. He must be a 2DX player.

1817
02:51:45,720 --> 02:51:47,840
Just messin', just messin'.

1818
02:51:47,840 --> 02:51:50,800
I don't like that shit. I don't like people to try to tell other people what they should, what the

1819
02:51:50,800 --> 02:51:57,800
can and can't put in your name. Can I want to be DJ whatever, go fucking for it. DJ

1820
02:51:59,080 --> 02:52:03,080
can stand for a lot of things, it could be somebody's name. I fucking hate it when people

1821
02:52:03,080 --> 02:52:09,520
F you of the week, I hope you're listening, pool boy, if somebody likes to rip on somebody

1822
02:52:09,520 --> 02:52:14,000
else for using DJ in their name, fuck you, you have no right to tell anybody what they

1823
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:19,640
can and can't put in their name just because they're not a real DJ. God, that pisses me

1824
02:52:49,640 --> 02:52:53,040
right so we're radio DJs exactly exactly so we have every right to call ourselves

1825
02:52:53,040 --> 02:52:59,160
DJ and my DJ Celica is actually from 2dx I don't want to be a DJ I didn't like

1826
02:52:59,160 --> 02:53:14,160
her in full house okay well yeah he did have a question oh I heard rumors that

1827
02:53:14,160 --> 02:53:18,400
Sony was going to do a karaoke revolution game themselves I saw it on a

1828
02:53:18,400 --> 02:53:23,400
website. Is that true? Meaning that Sony was making a karaoke revolution type game themselves.

1829
02:53:23,400 --> 02:53:30,160
Well, we did report it on Vanilla Sky earlier this week that Sony has asked the folks behind

1830
02:53:30,160 --> 02:53:34,140
the iToy, because the iToy has done so well, to look into the possibilities of doing something

1831
02:53:34,140 --> 02:53:41,120
karaoke related. And I remember some third party company was doing something too. Namtai

1832
02:53:41,120 --> 02:53:44,760
was that it? Oh no, Namtai does the camera, but there was another company that's looking

1833
02:53:44,760 --> 02:53:46,760
into doing the karaoke thing too.

1834
02:53:46,760 --> 02:53:47,760
So, and...

1835
02:53:47,760 --> 02:53:48,760
Ah!

1836
02:53:48,760 --> 02:53:49,760
Stop!

1837
02:53:49,760 --> 02:53:50,760
Ah!

1838
02:53:50,760 --> 02:53:51,760
Will I kill you?

1839
02:53:51,760 --> 02:53:52,760
Stop throwing the goddamn mic at me!

1840
02:53:52,760 --> 02:53:57,120
Fuck, if it's not, like, sitting at the goddamn chair of the mic, like, wrapping around me

1841
02:53:57,120 --> 02:54:02,760
like some sort of cobra snake or like some sort of fucking snake, like anaconda or something

1842
02:54:02,760 --> 02:54:07,080
trying to wrap around me, it's like sitting on the floor just, this goddamn microphone

1843
02:54:07,080 --> 02:54:08,080
is trying to kill me.

1844
02:54:08,080 --> 02:54:09,080
Did you have your foot wrapped around your foot?

1845
02:54:09,080 --> 02:54:10,080
I don't care!

1846
02:54:10,080 --> 02:54:11,080
How's it going under my foot?

1847
02:54:11,080 --> 02:54:12,080
I swear!

1848
02:54:12,080 --> 02:54:18,240
going under my foot? I swear! Oh, I have to address this in the chatroom, Bill. They're

1849
02:54:18,240 --> 02:54:25,320
saying that they have the right to call themselves BJ. Then go do it! Anyways, no, um, you don't

1850
02:54:25,320 --> 02:54:29,720
happen to remember that one karaoke game I showed you at the store. I do remember that.

1851
02:54:29,720 --> 02:54:33,640
The one with the ugly box. Yeah, the one we put at the very back of the store, hopefully

1852
02:54:33,640 --> 02:54:39,360
nobody would see. Yeah, piece of shit. That's what, what the fuck would I play that shit

1853
02:54:39,360 --> 02:54:46,360
The only cool thing is that it comes with three discs of karaoke music and nothing else because it's shit.

1854
02:54:46,360 --> 02:54:51,360
No, you threw it too low.

1855
02:54:51,360 --> 02:54:56,360
You know what, though, I hope no one buys that because you know what's going to happen.

1856
02:54:56,360 --> 02:55:01,360
When one person buys it, they'll send your store 20 copies.

1857
02:55:01,360 --> 02:55:06,360
Alright, well maybe I ought to go in and buy it then, just to see.

1858
02:55:06,360 --> 02:55:11,360
You know what, I'm thinking of, one of the things I'm thinking of doing is actually getting

1859
02:55:11,360 --> 02:55:14,800
the PC version of Pump It Up.

1860
02:55:14,800 --> 02:55:19,160
To get the new one with all the newer songs on it, though.

1861
02:55:19,160 --> 02:55:25,160
So I can play it in my no room upstairs at Premiere.

1862
02:55:25,160 --> 02:55:26,160
I love Pump It Up.

1863
02:55:26,160 --> 02:55:28,560
We'll have more news on that as we know it, but Namtai's working on something.

1864
02:55:28,560 --> 02:55:33,060
They're also doing a dance game for the iToys, so they're ripping off Konami's ideas left

1865
02:55:33,060 --> 02:55:36,240
and right, so we'll see what happens.

1866
02:55:36,240 --> 02:55:41,800
has a question. When is Rob on Final Fantasy XI? You can find me on the Bismarck server

1867
02:55:41,800 --> 02:55:48,840
on Final Fantasy XI, usually in the evenings. Loki has a smartass answer I'm sure. All the

1868
02:55:48,840 --> 02:55:54,120
time? I was just going to say I was on there too. Since he says I have a smartass answer,

1869
02:55:54,120 --> 02:55:59,200
yeah he's always on there because he doesn't have a life. He just plays Final Fantasy XI

1870
02:55:59,200 --> 02:56:03,880
all the time. And sleeps. I'm on there too. I'm Tomosuke. He'll see me butchering rabbits

1871
02:56:03,880 --> 02:56:08,840
left and right, because that's what I do. I butcher small, innocent animals. Since there's

1872
02:56:08,840 --> 02:56:11,680
no kittens in the game, rabbits will have to suffice.

1873
02:56:11,680 --> 02:56:16,240
Okay. You know what? I don't know that I can play that game, because I got motion sick

1874
02:56:16,240 --> 02:56:26,520
watching Rob. Just play it blindfolded. Blink, blink. Alright. Play more Ragnarok. Alright.

1875
02:56:26,520 --> 02:56:32,360
You can play on the Ragnarok server, if only on C11. No. I'll play Ragnarok, thank you.

1876
02:56:32,360 --> 02:56:37,800
Okay, almost done, no more questions please, we have to wrap up this segment.

1877
02:56:37,800 --> 02:56:42,100
Jazz would also like to know, and why don't you listen to me and check out Graduizik Cyber

1878
02:56:42,100 --> 02:56:51,840
on Doubles Wii, because it says brand new 10-footers, especially on American Mix, should

1879
02:56:51,840 --> 02:56:54,780
get talked about.

1880
02:56:54,780 --> 02:57:01,100
It's a new 10-footer on Doubles, hooray, 10-footer, it would be nice if Wii was easier to play

1881
02:57:01,100 --> 02:57:10,060
doubles at home oh my god that's the first otaku no video reference I've seen

1882
02:57:10,060 --> 02:57:19,180
in like 20 like forever um Jason would like to ask why is it that when I have

1883
02:57:19,180 --> 02:57:22,900
orange lounge radio turned up high and Papa music 8 turned up just enough to

1884
02:57:22,900 --> 02:57:27,860
hear it that I can do so much better on songs than when Papa music 8 is blaring

1885
02:57:27,860 --> 02:57:31,260
and, of course, the only music sound being made.

1886
02:57:31,260 --> 02:57:35,820
So why is it when Orange Lounge Radio is on, he does even better?

1887
02:57:35,820 --> 02:57:36,820
Any thoughts?

1888
02:57:36,820 --> 02:57:38,020
I don't think that that made sense.

1889
02:57:38,020 --> 02:57:44,660
Because our enchanted voodoo powers make it possible.

1890
02:57:44,660 --> 02:57:49,320
Because we're great, end of story.

1891
02:57:49,320 --> 02:57:51,860
And Darkchild would like to know, how long is my penis?

1892
02:57:51,860 --> 02:57:55,860
But unfortunately, we're out of time, so we'll have to table that question next week.

1893
02:57:55,860 --> 02:57:57,100
Sorry, gang.

1894
02:57:57,100 --> 02:58:02,100
p0k3smot42o

1895
02:58:27,100 --> 02:58:36,100
Moving on, who's next? Jonas, any final thoughts?

1896
02:58:36,100 --> 02:58:46,100
Hmm, not really that much thought about it. Really not much. Except the fact that I've

1897
02:58:46,100 --> 02:58:50,100
got 23rd Magus thinking about the next tournament and what he's going to do.

1898
02:58:50,100 --> 02:58:53,100
Dude, Darkchild, you know I'm joking. Shut up.

1899
02:59:53,100 --> 03:00:17,380
I have a word of advice for those folks making 10 foot edits to max remixes and things like

1900
03:00:17,380 --> 03:00:18,380
that.

1901
03:00:18,380 --> 03:00:19,380
Go outside!

1902
03:00:19,380 --> 03:00:20,380
Seriously.

1903
03:00:20,380 --> 03:00:22,180
Go outside and take in some fresh air.

1904
03:00:22,180 --> 03:00:26,420
Please, make some friends, get a girlfriend, get laid, do you some good.

1905
03:00:26,420 --> 03:00:27,420
All right.

1906
03:00:27,420 --> 03:00:34,700
Tonight's final word, I'm going to give tonight's final word of the show to Mikko.

1907
03:00:34,700 --> 03:00:40,980
So one word, one word that sums everything up for you, Mikko, right now.

1908
03:00:40,980 --> 03:00:42,420
A one-letter word?

1909
03:00:42,420 --> 03:00:44,180
Just one word, no, one word.

1910
03:00:44,180 --> 03:00:45,180
One word.

1911
03:00:45,180 --> 03:00:46,180
Bye.

1912

What is that? I don't know what Ace Mista is. Why do you know Ace Mista?

1927
03:02:32,740 --> 03:02:37,740
You know, you have to have an ace in moderation, you know what I mean?

1928
03:02:46,740 --> 03:02:49,740
You cannot have an ace all the time, you know?

1929
03:02:49,740 --> 03:02:58,740
Because if you have an ass all the time, then it's not special.

1930
03:02:58,740 --> 03:03:11,740
You know what mommy is saying? There is a boy and his name is Paul. And mommy like Paul.

1931
03:03:11,740 --> 03:03:16,740
He's a nice boy but he's gay and he only like to sing.

1932
03:03:16,740 --> 03:03:20,740
You know, he like an ass and Judy Garland, and that's all.

1933
03:03:25,740 --> 03:03:28,740
And what kind of life is it like that?

1934
03:03:29,740 --> 03:03:31,740
That's all.

1935
03:03:32,740 --> 03:03:36,740
You know, there's an ass and an ass over the rainbow, and that's all.

1936
03:03:37,740 --> 03:03:38,740
What kind of life?

1937
03:03:39,740 --> 03:03:41,740
I don't know why they do this.

1938
03:03:41,740 --> 03:03:48,220
I have to look at this book, it's an ace mister.

1939
03:03:48,220 --> 03:03:50,860
SambPsar is going to look at this book.

1940
03:03:50,860 --> 03:03:53,180
I am going to look at it.

1941
03:03:53,180 --> 03:03:56,080
Look at mami, I am going to look at ace mister now.

1942
03:03:56,080 --> 03:04:01,080
Look at mami, okay, look at mami.

1943
03:04:01,080 --> 03:04:02,500
Ace mister.

1944
03:04:02,500 --> 03:04:27,500
I was shocked, you know. I was so shocked. It was just ass right away, you know.

1945
03:04:27,500 --> 03:04:45,860
I thought they would be table of contents, didn't they?

1946
03:04:45,860 --> 03:04:57,020
Thank you very much everybody.

1947
03:04:57,020 --> 03:05:24,020
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

1948
03:05:24,020 --> 03:05:29,340
Welcome everybody to the Orange Lounge Radio after birth for the parts that were too hot

1949
03:05:29,340 --> 03:05:33,380
for Orange Lounge Radio. You can hear them now.

1950
03:05:33,380 --> 03:05:41,260
So any after birth thoughts, Jamie? You were looking at some interesting movies

1951
03:05:41,260 --> 03:05:47,140
earlier. I think your mic might be off. Check the mic,

1952
03:05:47,140 --> 03:05:51,740
make sure it's not off. This has got Sable in it, in the bad fake

1953
03:05:51,740 --> 03:05:58,740
porn thing. But it's widescreen, so it's forgiven. Because pan and scan sucks.

1954
03:05:58,740 --> 03:06:05,180
Yeah, I don't like pan and scan either. Pan and scan is bad because you lose a part of

1955
03:06:05,180 --> 03:06:09,740
the picture. Everyone who says that the black bars cut

1956
03:06:09,740 --> 03:06:16,880
off the screen is an idiot. I realize where it can be irritating, but here's

1957
03:06:16,880 --> 03:06:19,780
what's most irritating. When they built the TVs, they should have made them the same size

1958
03:06:19,780 --> 03:06:23,040
as the movie screens, and then we would have never had this problem, so F whoever came

1959
03:06:23,040 --> 03:06:24,040
up with that idea.

1960
03:06:24,040 --> 03:06:26,740
Well, you know what, my next TV is going to be a widescreen TV.

1961
03:06:26,740 --> 03:06:30,180
Exactly, see that's the nice thing, now they are making the TVs the same size as the movies,

1962
03:06:30,180 --> 03:06:34,660
so people will never have to worry about the black bars, and are you missing something

1963
03:06:34,660 --> 03:06:37,820
with the widescreen, all that stuff, they won't have to worry about it ever again.

1964
03:06:37,820 --> 03:06:38,820
It's already been thought of.

1965
03:06:38,820 --> 03:06:40,380
You know what we need to do?

1966
03:06:40,380 --> 03:06:41,380
We need a chill-a-thon.

1967
03:06:41,380 --> 03:06:42,380
A chill-a-thon?

1968
03:06:42,380 --> 03:06:44,660
We need a chill-a-thon.

1969
03:06:44,660 --> 03:06:45,660
How so?

1970
03:06:45,660 --> 03:06:49,180
Like, just take those two DVDs and watch them back to back.

1971
03:06:49,180 --> 03:06:55,100
by me, and I have her new CD, so if I left it at work, don't.

1972
03:06:55,100 --> 03:06:56,100
It's okay.

1973
03:06:56,100 --> 03:06:59,780
And then just to break up the Jonas, watch Rejected.

1974
03:06:59,780 --> 03:07:00,780
Okay.

1975
03:07:00,780 --> 03:07:01,780
You know what?

1976
03:07:01,780 --> 03:07:08,500
It's weird that on Bitter Films that made Rejected has a new compilation coming out,

1977
03:07:08,500 --> 03:07:09,940
which should be good.

1978
03:07:09,940 --> 03:07:11,300
It's going to be a bunch of their stuff.

1979
03:07:11,300 --> 03:07:14,460
And they show Billy's balloon at Spike and Mike's, and that made me happy, because Billy's

1980
03:07:14,460 --> 03:07:17,420
balloon is great, because I love when balloons beat up little children.

1981
03:07:17,420 --> 03:07:18,420
Aww.

1982
03:07:48,420 --> 03:07:52,220
Did I get rid of it?

1983
03:07:52,220 --> 03:07:54,180
I don't think I would have deleted it, but I don't...

1984
03:07:54,180 --> 03:07:55,180
Oh, there it is.

1985
03:07:55,180 --> 03:07:56,180
There it is.

1986
03:07:56,180 --> 03:07:58,340
If your anus is bleeding, use a tampon.

1987
03:07:58,340 --> 03:08:02,440
I just got a copy off this Japanese site of max 30,000.

1988
03:08:02,440 --> 03:08:07,220
It's two seconds long.

1989
03:08:07,220 --> 03:08:10,620
That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard of in my entire life.

1990
03:08:10,620 --> 03:08:12,620
What the hell?

1991
03:08:12,620 --> 03:08:29,220
for the love of God, and all that is holy, my anus is bleeding, wow, that's great, that

1992
03:08:29,220 --> 03:08:38,780
sounded like me shitting, that sounds like a robot taking a shit, aww, bye Zero, nice

1993
03:08:38,780 --> 03:08:39,780
Nice knowing you.

1994
03:08:39,780 --> 03:08:40,780
Bye Nico.

1995
03:08:40,780 --> 03:08:41,780
Have fun in the castle.

1996
03:08:41,780 --> 03:08:42,780
Take care.

1997
03:08:42,780 --> 03:08:45,820
Okay, tonight's post show, we're going to start it off with that air remix, and then

1998
03:08:45,820 --> 03:08:53,100
after the air remix, we're going to go into that Now Dance 2004 compilation from Britain

1999
03:08:53,100 --> 03:08:58,260
because it's neat, and lots of good songs in it, including some Kylie Minogue, some

2000
03:08:58,260 --> 03:09:01,700
Ian Van Dau, and some other artists you may know from Balmani releases.

2001
03:09:01,700 --> 03:09:02,700
Enjoy.

2002
03:09:02,700 --> 03:09:04,700
night

2003
03:10:32,700 --> 03:10:39,700
Let me remind, she chose not to cry

2004
03:10:39,700 --> 03:10:46,700
It's not a lie, it's not a lie

2005
03:10:46,700 --> 03:10:53,700
It's not a lie, it's not a lie

2006
03:10:53,700 --> 03:11:08,700
Let me remind, she chose not to cry It's alright, for your lover has come home

2007
03:11:08,700 --> 03:11:20,700
Never ever be alone, by your side I'll always say, never ever be alone.
