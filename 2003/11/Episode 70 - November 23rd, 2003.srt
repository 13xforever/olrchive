1
00:01:16,923 --> 00:01:18,944
[SPEAKER_16]: And now for our feature presentation.

2
00:01:25,068 --> 00:01:28,670
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio Live is now on the air.

3
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:36,134
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio Live is a live talk program dedicated to all things Bomani and Bensum.

4
00:01:36,977 --> 00:01:40,259
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio may contain adult content.

5
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:43,140
[SPEAKER_12]: You probably shouldn't let your children listen.

6
00:01:44,241 --> 00:01:52,425
[SPEAKER_12]: If you do let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio, they may turn into evil little demons from hell!

7
00:01:53,846 --> 00:01:57,228
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.

8
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:06,991
[SPEAKER_15]: Now you see that evil will always triumph because good is dumb.

9
00:02:07,231 --> 00:02:09,791
[SPEAKER_15]: Trash, drunk, and stupid is no way to go through, sir.

10
00:02:10,092 --> 00:02:13,652
[SPEAKER_15]: He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body.

11
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:17,353
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, makes you look like an ass is what he does, Ed.

12
00:02:17,713 --> 00:02:18,433
[SPEAKER_15]: Hamburgers!

13
00:02:19,213 --> 00:02:21,374
[SPEAKER_15]: The cornerstone of any nutritionist's practice.

14
00:02:21,614 --> 00:02:22,414
[SPEAKER_15]: That was huge.

15
00:02:23,954 --> 00:02:24,554
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.

16
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,795
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you mind if I take my new car for a ride?

17
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:31,969
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura DarkSakura

18
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:54,872
[SPEAKER_12]: Any time, any place, baby.

19
00:02:55,152 --> 00:02:55,672
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki.

20
00:02:56,152 --> 00:02:57,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Ow, my foot!

21
00:02:57,512 --> 00:02:59,693
[SPEAKER_11]: Why did I shoot myself in my foot?

22
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,833
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio.

23
00:03:04,214 --> 00:03:10,415
[SPEAKER_19]: We are live, and this is episode number 70 for November the 23rd of 2003.

24
00:03:10,495 --> 00:03:17,037
[SPEAKER_19]: You're tuned in to the Bomani Scene's most underprepared radio station of all things being money.

25
00:03:18,018 --> 00:03:19,879
[SPEAKER_19]: My name is Rob Roberts, if you might know me as Sky.

26
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:31,946
[SPEAKER_19]: Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, back from her three-week, two-week vacation, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers, you know her better, DarkSakura.

27
00:03:32,206 --> 00:03:34,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, long time no talk, I'm cooking, bye.

28
00:03:34,327 --> 00:03:36,469
[SPEAKER_19]: Tonight she's Iron Chef Sakura right now.

29
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,611
[SPEAKER_19]: In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

30
00:03:40,891 --> 00:03:44,053
[SPEAKER_19]: Hello, I need to, what the hell?

31
00:03:44,393 --> 00:03:45,434
[SPEAKER_19]: The cords have just...

32
00:03:46,804 --> 00:03:47,927
[SPEAKER_19]: all mated with each other.

33
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:52,617
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki picked up the microphone and it's like taking the Christmas lights out of the box on Christmas.

34
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:54,619
[SPEAKER_19]: What the hell is this doing here?

35
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,380
[SPEAKER_19]: There's like a ribbing cable.

36
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,541
[SPEAKER_19]: This random printer cord is mixed in too.

37
00:03:59,221 --> 00:04:02,303
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, if we sound a little disorganized tonight, it's because we are.

38
00:04:02,363 --> 00:04:04,343
[SPEAKER_19]: We have Jamie over here cooking.

39
00:04:05,004 --> 00:04:08,105
[SPEAKER_19]: We have Loki over here, you know, trying to untangle the cords.

40
00:04:08,185 --> 00:04:10,306
[SPEAKER_19]: Me, I've been feeling kind of eh this evening.

41
00:04:10,346 --> 00:04:11,166
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll get into that later.

42
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:13,887
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm just like now getting with it.

43
00:04:13,927 --> 00:04:16,648
[SPEAKER_19]: My Tylenol is finally kicking in and I can like see again.

44
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:22,831
[SPEAKER_19]: Also with us tonight, SayHello20 is here and I know there's no microphone.

45
00:04:25,507 --> 00:04:25,928
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, what's up?

46
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:26,948
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, how you doing?

47
00:04:26,988 --> 00:04:27,669
[SPEAKER_19]: Long time no see.

48
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:29,110
[SPEAKER_21]: I was here like two weeks ago.

49
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:29,991
[SPEAKER_21]: How could it be that long?

50
00:04:30,432 --> 00:04:31,152
[SPEAKER_19]: Ah, long enough.

51
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:31,893
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, okay.

52
00:04:32,253 --> 00:04:33,935
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, what did you bring with you tonight?

53
00:04:35,156 --> 00:04:35,936
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a surprise.

54
00:04:36,297 --> 00:04:39,179
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, don't get... If you really want me to tell them... Nah, tell them first break.

55
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:39,860
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,181
[SPEAKER_19]: Who else did you bring with you here?

57
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,482
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's have her introduce herself.

58
00:04:43,663 --> 00:04:48,688
[SPEAKER_21]: Most people who are listening should know her if they go to RBGL, or actually did go to RBGL.

59
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:54,415
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, but we're a worldwide show.

60
00:04:54,455 --> 00:04:55,516
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that's right, huh?

61
00:04:55,656 --> 00:04:56,737
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, here she is.

62
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:57,517
[SPEAKER_21]: Miko.

63
00:04:59,298 --> 00:04:59,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

64
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:00,959
[SPEAKER_19]: How are you?

65
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:02,860
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm fine.

66
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,521
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you?

67
00:05:03,901 --> 00:05:04,341
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm good.

68
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:06,162
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome to our disorganized mess of a show.

69
00:05:08,404 --> 00:05:09,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this is fun.

70
00:05:09,244 --> 00:05:09,905
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

71
00:05:09,925 --> 00:05:12,066
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, hey, the fun's just about to start.

72
00:05:13,635 --> 00:05:15,416
[SPEAKER_19]: We haven't even gotten there yet.

73
00:05:15,476 --> 00:05:15,736
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

74
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:29,220
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to take a quick break to try and organize ourselves, and we'll get that surprise ready, and we'll start off the show with it as soon as we come back after a little bit of this and a little bit of that from the Bomani world.

75
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,660
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll be back.

76
00:06:33,322 --> 00:06:34,886
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

77
00:10:41,946 --> 00:10:43,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, did you hear about that show?

78
00:10:43,927 --> 00:10:44,507
[SPEAKER_18]: What show?

79
00:10:44,807 --> 00:10:50,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they play a lot of great Fermanian video game music, but if you listen to it, you have to listen to it again within seven days.

80
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,951
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I've heard of that station.

81
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:52,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

82
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,892
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I even listened to it a couple weeks ago.

83
00:10:55,372 --> 00:10:57,633
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, what happens to you if you don't listen to it again?

84
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:58,794
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, you die.

85
00:10:59,414 --> 00:10:59,954
[SPEAKER_22]: I, what?

86
00:11:00,774 --> 00:11:04,976
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, wait, what's this crazy bitch doing coming out of my computer screen?

87
00:11:05,877 --> 00:11:06,057
Ahhhh!

88
00:11:07,185 --> 00:11:09,847
[SPEAKER_20]: Orange Lounge Radio, listen or die!

89
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:17,491
[SPEAKER_22]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 70.

90
00:11:19,172 --> 00:11:26,477
[SPEAKER_19]: If you want to join our chatroom, head on over to www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on chat, but I warn you guys, it is a fucking madhouse in there tonight.

91
00:11:26,497 --> 00:11:30,539
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a lot of people there, and I'm having a hard time keeping up with the chatroom, but...

92
00:11:32,971 --> 00:11:35,373
[SPEAKER_19]: and of course I'm trying to eat as well at the same time.

93
00:11:35,633 --> 00:11:36,713
[SPEAKER_19]: And Jamie, very delicious.

94
00:11:36,773 --> 00:11:37,114
[SPEAKER_19]: Good job.

95
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:37,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

96
00:11:38,034 --> 00:11:39,255
[SPEAKER_19]: And I usually don't eat fish.

97
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:44,598
[SPEAKER_19]: I just made a confession earlier today in one of our buddies' live journal, in Maren Chan's live journal.

98
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:47,720
[SPEAKER_19]: I was saying I've never in my life eaten at Red Lobster.

99
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:48,420
[SPEAKER_19]: Ever.

100
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:49,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Red Lobster's good.

101
00:11:50,141 --> 00:11:51,642
[SPEAKER_19]: I know, but I've never eaten there.

102
00:11:51,902 --> 00:11:53,443
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you know it's good if you've never eaten there?

103
00:11:53,703 --> 00:11:56,165
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, because everybody tells me it's good and I believe my friends usually.

104
00:11:56,185 --> 00:11:57,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you believe everything everyone tells you?

105
00:11:57,386 --> 00:11:57,626
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

106
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:03,977
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Rob, I have some Swampland I could sell you in Arizona.

107
00:12:04,597 --> 00:12:04,858
[SPEAKER_19]: What?

108
00:12:04,878 --> 00:12:06,299
[SPEAKER_19]: You have what?

109
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:08,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some Swampland I could sell you in Arizona.

110
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:08,500
[SPEAKER_19]: Really?

111
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,481
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it by the beach?

112
00:12:10,281 --> 00:12:10,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

113
00:12:10,842 --> 00:12:11,262
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, cool.

114
00:12:12,623 --> 00:12:16,766
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway... They have white papers and they're super stupid.

115
00:12:16,786 --> 00:12:19,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course the chat room is going, Of course Rob doesn't eat fish.

116
00:12:19,968 --> 00:12:20,668
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a fag.

117
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:21,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Ha ha ha ha.

118
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:22,630
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, really funny.

119
00:12:24,315 --> 00:12:25,957
[SPEAKER_19]: Zero has brought over his sex box.

120
00:12:26,297 --> 00:12:26,838
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that comes...

121
00:12:44,107 --> 00:12:47,589
[SPEAKER_19]: DDR Ultramix, which I have not seen at all yet.

122
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:51,891
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think a lot of people here haven't really seen this at all yet.

123
00:12:52,352 --> 00:12:54,273
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're getting to see this for the first time.

124
00:12:54,293 --> 00:12:56,334
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, a few things first.

125
00:12:56,594 --> 00:12:59,175
[SPEAKER_19]: A, the wrong cables were brought over.

126
00:12:59,255 --> 00:13:03,318
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're looking at this game in black and white right now because we're trying to hook... It's overwhelmingly green.

127
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:04,498
[SPEAKER_19]: Good.

128
00:13:04,558 --> 00:13:05,459
[SPEAKER_19]: It's blue, isn't it?

129
00:13:07,658 --> 00:13:08,599
[SPEAKER_19]: I had heard it was really blue.

130
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:09,499
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, a few things first.

131
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:15,885
[SPEAKER_19]: Component cables were brought over, so A, we can't hook it up to any webcam or anything, so you're just going to have to kind of listen to us.

132
00:13:16,306 --> 00:13:23,832
[SPEAKER_19]: B, we're looking at it in black and white because we're plugging component cables into a RCA system.

133
00:13:24,753 --> 00:13:24,973
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

134
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:31,388
[SPEAKER_21]: Basically, the way that the screen looks, it's kind of built up as if you're looking at a concert stage.

135
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:40,676
[SPEAKER_20]: It's got like a whole little set of Rattray type things on the side, and on the opening screen it has like spotlights on the top, and it's mostly really bright white.

136
00:13:41,116 --> 00:13:44,118
[SPEAKER_19]: And out of all of those EDR games, it has the coolest menu music.

137
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:46,480
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I agree.

138
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:51,925
[SPEAKER_19]: So far, just with the menus and everything, I've been incredibly impressed, so... Yeah, I'm sorry, Jamie?

139
00:13:53,186 --> 00:13:54,507
[SPEAKER_02]: It sort of sounds like porn music, though.

140
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:56,459
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it does.

141
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:57,120
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm kind of surprised.

142
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:03,464
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, I want to see... I have heard that Do That Fang has a really scandalous gay video to it.

143
00:14:03,484 --> 00:14:03,985
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, you know.

144
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:04,685
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to see it.

145
00:14:04,725 --> 00:14:06,927
[SPEAKER_19]: We figured that you would like this video when you're at my house.

146
00:14:07,027 --> 00:14:09,969
[SPEAKER_22]: I must see Do That Fang, so if we could play Do That Fang, please.

147
00:14:10,729 --> 00:14:11,069
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

148
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,491
[SPEAKER_22]: And then you guys can hear this, too.

149
00:14:14,732 --> 00:14:15,653
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a funny song.

150
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:18,354
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we're okay.

151
00:14:18,394 --> 00:14:18,735
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll just...

152
00:14:22,218 --> 00:14:23,418
[SPEAKER_19]: Probably better watch the video.

153
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:30,040
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah!

154
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,501
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, there's like, wow.

155
00:14:36,382 --> 00:14:38,662
[SPEAKER_22]: This is the gayest video I've ever seen in my life.

156
00:14:38,702 --> 00:14:43,444
[SPEAKER_22]: There's like women in fur and half-naked men.

157
00:15:09,636 --> 00:15:13,859
[SPEAKER_22]: These two chicks are standing in front of a microphone that says the name of their band, Masai.

158
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,661
[SPEAKER_22]: It's very Britney Spears to me.

159
00:15:16,681 --> 00:15:18,182
[SPEAKER_22]: They look like Britney Spears clones.

160
00:15:18,202 --> 00:15:19,323
[SPEAKER_22]: I guess it's two girls.

161
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:31,991
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my god!

162
00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:33,172
[SPEAKER_22]: They're not wearing pants!

163
00:15:33,472 --> 00:15:34,153
[SPEAKER_22]: That's awesome!

164
00:15:37,915 --> 00:15:39,697
[SPEAKER_22]: Goddammit, why can't this be in colors?

165
00:15:39,717 --> 00:15:47,307
[SPEAKER_22]: Their undies are wide anyway.

166
00:15:52,454 --> 00:15:54,737
[SPEAKER_22]: My god, I might just have to buy an Xbox for this.

167
00:16:00,124 --> 00:16:01,666
[SPEAKER_20]: I know the next song you gotta play though.

168
00:16:01,747 --> 00:16:02,568
[SPEAKER_22]: That was great.

169
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:04,590
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, what's the next song we gotta hear?

170
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,293
[SPEAKER_20]: Ready Steady Go by Paul Oakenfold.

171
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,115
[SPEAKER_22]: Ready Steady Go by Paul Oakenfold.

172
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:09,377
[SPEAKER_20]: It's an awesome song.

173
00:16:10,418 --> 00:16:12,761
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, let's hear Ready Steady Go by Paul Oakenfold.

174
00:16:13,883 --> 00:16:14,504
[SPEAKER_22]: How did Loki do?

175
00:16:14,544 --> 00:16:16,747
[SPEAKER_22]: Loki got an A on Do That Thing by Masai.

176
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,483
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, this is a really cool one, and the steps will kind of trip you up halfway through it.

177
00:16:29,543 --> 00:16:30,083
[SPEAKER_21]: It's really cool.

178
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,111
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, it has a lot of steps really close to 3-Days.

179
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:53,490
[SPEAKER_23]: All like three minutes?

180
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:54,731
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh no.

181
00:16:55,211 --> 00:16:56,252
[SPEAKER_21]: So edited for length.

182
00:16:56,352 --> 00:16:57,793
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah, I thought you meant like did I edit?

183
00:16:57,813 --> 00:16:58,793
[SPEAKER_21]: No, this is the full thing.

184
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:01,395
[SPEAKER_21]: But they got all the elements of the song.

185
00:17:03,777 --> 00:17:04,457
[SPEAKER_21]: Like perfect.

186
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:14,164
[SPEAKER_21]: And what I'm really impressed of is the fact that almost all the songs, like the license... Oh my god, a slowdown!

187
00:17:14,705 --> 00:17:17,307
[SPEAKER_21]: They all have really good steps.

188
00:17:18,427 --> 00:17:18,768
[SPEAKER_18]: Really?

189
00:17:19,268 --> 00:17:21,610
[SPEAKER_21]: Except for shiny disco balls.

190
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:23,842
[SPEAKER_19]: God, I love that song, though.

191
00:17:25,263 --> 00:17:26,664
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just so repetitive.

192
00:17:26,704 --> 00:17:28,924
[SPEAKER_19]: Whoa, speed up!

193
00:18:16,258 --> 00:18:18,560
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, that was Ready Steady Go by Paul Oakenfold.

194
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,503
[SPEAKER_19]: We're playing DDR Ultramix here on Orange Lounge Radio.

195
00:18:22,444 --> 00:18:23,846
[SPEAKER_19]: No webcam tonight, guys.

196
00:18:23,906 --> 00:18:24,927
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.

197
00:18:25,087 --> 00:18:27,749
[SPEAKER_19]: We haven't been able to get it working again since the computer upgrade.

198
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:33,635
[SPEAKER_19]: And we can't hook Ultramix directly into our video card either because we don't have that either.

199
00:18:37,694 --> 00:18:42,037
[SPEAKER_21]: They also have a cool song that, of course, most people know it, Castles in the Sky.

200
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:44,399
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, Castles in the Sky, most people know that song already.

201
00:18:44,639 --> 00:18:46,600
[SPEAKER_21]: They did a really good job with the steps of that too.

202
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,181
[SPEAKER_18]: That's cool.

203
00:18:47,381 --> 00:18:48,562
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's hear one of the remixes.

204
00:18:48,822 --> 00:18:52,264
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like to play one of the new remixes for everybody.

205
00:18:52,284 --> 00:18:54,145
[SPEAKER_19]: The two remixes that are on here right now.

206
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:55,606
[SPEAKER_19]: What are the unlocks so far?

207
00:18:55,827 --> 00:19:03,312
[SPEAKER_20]: The unlocks that I've done so far are the Metal Gear Solid song from Beatmania.

208
00:19:04,392 --> 00:19:15,005
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, this is Keep Your Body Movin' by Thuggy D. The cool thing about this Thuggy D guy is the fact that he remixed Absolute and Insertion.

209
00:19:15,285 --> 00:19:20,231
[SPEAKER_19]: I think most people are pretty convinced that this is just Scotty D from Drop the Bomb.

210
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:21,313
[SPEAKER_19]: It's actually not.

211
00:19:22,054 --> 00:19:22,354
[SPEAKER_19]: Really?

212
00:19:22,434 --> 00:19:22,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

213
00:19:26,593 --> 00:19:32,935
[SPEAKER_20]: they have a link on the internet to where you can go and get his group information this is very interesting

214
00:19:57,031 --> 00:20:00,133
[SPEAKER_19]: I haven't heard a DDR song about DDR in a long time.

215
00:20:01,974 --> 00:20:05,476
[SPEAKER_19]: Really, I thought this was probably the worst song on the whole night.

216
00:20:05,776 --> 00:20:10,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is definitely like an old Dippy Mania song.

217
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:13,121
[SPEAKER_21]: It's interesting, I'll give it that.

218
00:20:21,363 --> 00:20:22,784
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, Ballad For You is in this.

219
00:20:22,924 --> 00:20:35,388
[SPEAKER_11]: I also unlocked one of the Infinite Prayers.

220
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:37,449
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, cool.

221
00:20:37,629 --> 00:20:41,270
[SPEAKER_19]: Somebody had told me that Santa Malete, the BLT style, is in Unlock, actually.

222
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,050
[SPEAKER_19]: No, it's just already in there.

223
00:20:43,131 --> 00:20:44,511
[SPEAKER_19]: It's out of the box.

224
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:47,252
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, the remix Santa Malete, the new one.

225
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:48,132
[SPEAKER_19]: I haven't heard that yet.

226
00:20:48,152 --> 00:20:49,953
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, it's not new if you play 4-style, but...

227
00:20:51,118 --> 00:20:51,938
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I haven't heard that.

228
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:55,360
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a pretty neat looking background, considering we were looking at it in black and white.

229
00:20:57,141 --> 00:20:58,522
[SPEAKER_21]: The videos are generally pretty good.

230
00:20:58,542 --> 00:20:58,982
[SPEAKER_19]: Very interesting.

231
00:21:00,863 --> 00:21:03,085
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, maybe one more, for now.

232
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,106
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, let's play the two remixes real quick.

233
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:06,466
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

234
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:12,770
[SPEAKER_19]: Now the quickening, too.

235
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,171
[SPEAKER_19]: Wait, we'll play a little clip of There For You, we'll just play the clip.

236
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,092
[SPEAKER_19]: This is There For You by WD.

237
00:21:22,236 --> 00:21:24,258
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, so this is Absolute.

238
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:28,961
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a remix of Absolute by Thuggy D. What is this called?

239
00:21:29,362 --> 00:21:31,263
[SPEAKER_19]: This is called Cut and Stuff It Mix.

240
00:21:31,283 --> 00:21:32,124
[SPEAKER_19]: Cut and Stuff It, yeah.

241
00:21:32,164 --> 00:21:32,885
[SPEAKER_19]: Cut and Stuff Mix.

242
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:33,845
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, let's hear it.

243
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:46,215
[SPEAKER_21]: And there's the Machine Gun Kelly version insertion once again done by Thuggy D. Well, we'll see.

244
00:21:46,295 --> 00:21:47,756
[SPEAKER_19]: It gets better in the middle.

245
00:21:47,776 --> 00:21:49,538
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, we're going to listen to Absolute Cut and Stuff Mix.

246
00:23:17,068 --> 00:23:18,770
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow, it sounds like a hoedown all of a sudden.

247
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,558
[SPEAKER_19]: What the hell was that?

248
00:23:25,139 --> 00:23:26,240
[SPEAKER_19]: Somebody banging on the piano.

249
00:23:28,022 --> 00:23:29,004
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, kinda lame.

250
00:23:29,104 --> 00:23:29,645
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't like that.

251
00:23:30,506 --> 00:23:31,026
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't like that.

252
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,381
[SPEAKER_19]: Chatroom doesn't seem to care for it much either.

253
00:23:33,621 --> 00:23:34,942
[SPEAKER_02]: That was disasterific.

254
00:23:35,103 --> 00:23:36,023
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

255
00:23:36,063 --> 00:23:37,785
[SPEAKER_19]: Chatroom would like to hear the insertion mix.

256
00:23:37,805 --> 00:23:39,766
[SPEAKER_19]: It sounds like there's a lot of them that like that little clip.

257
00:23:40,607 --> 00:23:43,930
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, we'll play that and then we're going to do some other show and then we'll come back to this later.

258
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:51,596
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, basically the Absolute sound like a crappy ass happy hardcore slash Disneyland electrical parade.

259
00:23:52,336 --> 00:23:52,877
[SPEAKER_19]: Interesting.

260
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,840
[SPEAKER_19]: God damn it, now I'm going to have to buy a fucking Xbox.

261
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,103
[SPEAKER_19]: No, you'll like the insertion one.

262
00:23:59,264 --> 00:23:59,765
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, here we go.

263
00:24:00,387 --> 00:24:01,670
[SPEAKER_19]: Machine Gun Kelly mix of insertion.

264
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,686
[SPEAKER_22]: Here's your typical slowdown that you're used to in the normal insertion.

265
00:25:42,196 --> 00:25:44,916
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, that was insertion of the machine gun, Cali makes no speedup at the end.

266
00:25:45,362 --> 00:25:48,843
[SPEAKER_20]: No, and, no, yeah, it was still cool, I like the way that they did it.

267
00:25:48,983 --> 00:25:51,384
[SPEAKER_18]: I like how someone in the chat room put it, it sounds like a Loki remix.

268
00:25:51,724 --> 00:25:54,345
[SPEAKER_20]: It kinda does, actually.

269
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:54,965
[SPEAKER_18]: It really does.

270
00:25:56,285 --> 00:26:01,287
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, Buggy D all around did a good job, except for Absolute.

271
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:06,768
[SPEAKER_20]: And I mean, I just wonder if they do make another one for the Xbox, if they do.

272
00:26:06,788 --> 00:26:11,990
[SPEAKER_20]: From what I understand, this is just more of a promise kept to bring one to it.

273
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:14,031
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

274
00:26:16,028 --> 00:26:17,870
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, yeah, it's one from Dance Maniacs.

275
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:24,074
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I mean, if they do, for the fact, make a new one, I wonder if he's gonna be back doing more stuff.

276
00:26:24,354 --> 00:26:28,557
[SPEAKER_20]: If he's gonna turn into, you know, Scotty D or... We'll see.

277
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:32,420
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, let's, uh, pull the plug on Ultramix for now.

278
00:26:33,921 --> 00:26:35,883
[SPEAKER_22]: God, no, turn off the love to me, Jesus.

279
00:26:37,244 --> 00:26:37,524
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

280
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,419
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, we'll play that one.

281
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,727
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe later in the show we'll get to the Metal Gear one and the shiny disco balls.

282
00:26:44,807 --> 00:26:45,929
[SPEAKER_19]: Some people want to hear that too.

283
00:26:47,668 --> 00:26:54,033
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, Ryan, you've been playing this more than anybody else here, really.

284
00:26:54,733 --> 00:26:56,654
[SPEAKER_19]: Being a DDR fan, what did you think of Ultramix?

285
00:26:57,295 --> 00:26:59,396
[SPEAKER_19]: And compare it to Max 2 for PlayStation 2.

286
00:26:59,596 --> 00:27:05,401
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I mean, you can kind of compare it as out of the box that Max 2 would be better.

287
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:09,083
[SPEAKER_20]: But a lot of the redeeming qualities, too...

288
00:27:12,646 --> 00:27:20,133
[SPEAKER_20]: The Xbox One is the fact that out of the box it's got a couple good remixes and it has a couple new songs that you haven't heard.

289
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:28,480
[SPEAKER_20]: And on top of that, it's more of a party game now for the fact that you can have four people playing in your house at the same time.

290
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:35,306
[SPEAKER_20]: Which we actually tested around a little bit last night and it's pretty fun because it gets pretty competitive.

291
00:27:36,341 --> 00:27:44,103
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, on top of that, of course you have the Xbox Live stuff where you can get on there and play up to four people at once.

292
00:27:45,723 --> 00:27:50,604
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, transferring edits back and forth and stuff like that.

293
00:27:51,404 --> 00:27:54,425
[SPEAKER_20]: I managed to play against one guy with an edit he had.

294
00:27:54,925 --> 00:27:59,006
[SPEAKER_20]: And seriously, a lot of these people who made edits are really, really bad.

295
00:27:59,226 --> 00:28:01,907
[SPEAKER_19]: It almost makes a lot of the Tournament 4 stuff look good.

296
00:28:01,927 --> 00:28:03,867
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, it's that sad.

297
00:28:04,326 --> 00:28:07,189
[SPEAKER_02]: About the Xbox Live, though, can you talk to them while you're playing?

298
00:28:07,449 --> 00:28:15,095
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, when you buy an Xbox Live with the DDR pad, if you look in the front of the DDR pad, it has a part where you can hook your communicator in, and they give you like a stick.

299
00:28:15,175 --> 00:28:16,016
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, so it's hooked to the pad?

300
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,138
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and you can put a memory card in there, too.

301
00:28:18,158 --> 00:28:18,898
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh.

302
00:28:18,938 --> 00:28:24,063
[SPEAKER_21]: And the cool thing is they give you a six-foot extension for your headset, because, you know, it only goes down about three feet.

303
00:28:24,143 --> 00:28:24,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

304
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:27,225
[SPEAKER_21]: You can get a longer extension for it so you can talk while you're dancing.

305
00:28:27,245 --> 00:28:28,847
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes into the controller port.

306
00:28:29,235 --> 00:28:29,395
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

307
00:28:30,255 --> 00:28:36,137
[SPEAKER_20]: And another good thing, too, that I was really impressed with was the actual pad that comes with it if you buy it.

308
00:28:36,598 --> 00:28:40,899
[SPEAKER_20]: It's, I mean, I know a lot of people say, oh, we have really good anti-slip stuff.

309
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:48,402
[SPEAKER_20]: That pad on the Xbox, I got a running start about 10 feet away, jumped up on it, and it didn't move anywhere.

310
00:28:48,902 --> 00:28:53,423
[SPEAKER_20]: I was able to play stuff like Suguru really, really well, double ate it.

311
00:28:54,104 --> 00:28:54,664
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I mean, there's...

312
00:28:55,544 --> 00:28:59,525
[SPEAKER_20]: No problem with the pad, it's all a really, really good thing all around.

313
00:28:59,585 --> 00:29:04,907
[SPEAKER_20]: And plus, the online stuff, you're going to be able to download new characters, you're going to be able to download new songs.

314
00:29:05,447 --> 00:29:18,712
[SPEAKER_20]: And if they keep going at the rate they are with the new songs they've released onto the game itself, and they have those really good steps like that, with the exception of a couple, it's going to prove to be a very good game.

315
00:29:19,332 --> 00:29:33,283
[SPEAKER_19]: One of my buddies had said he was playing the DDR Xbox online, he was playing through Xbox Live, and he was playing some guy and challenging him, and then at the end he beat this guy, and he heard over the microphone, like he heard a kind of distance, man, this guy just beat me!

316
00:29:34,084 --> 00:29:38,047
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, he says this Xbox Live thing really makes DDR fun.

317
00:29:38,547 --> 00:29:55,964
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, here's the thing, too, is the fact that if you don't want to go out and spend money at the arcades all the time, and you just want to have a small little DDR at home to play against other people, that's a great way to go, for the fact that you still have your own screen, and, you know, the other person has their own screen, so you're not sharing the screen.

318
00:29:56,605 --> 00:30:00,129
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a lot of fun, and to hear some of that chatter online is really funny.

319
00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:02,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Except for the delay, like...

320
00:30:02,984 --> 00:30:06,465
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, it's not that bad, because the songs load up on their own.

321
00:30:06,545 --> 00:30:08,105
[SPEAKER_02]: For one, the chat delay.

322
00:30:08,505 --> 00:30:12,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know when I was playing PSO for a while, you'd get maybe five seconds in between.

323
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:14,527
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, it happens occasionally.

324
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:30,050
[SPEAKER_20]: But the one thing I like is the fact that both songs don't have to be running totally consecutively, because the Xbox will load it, and it just throws up your... The only thing that it really transmits back and forth is your score, as you play against the other person on the same song.

325
00:30:30,424 --> 00:30:32,346
[SPEAKER_19]: Have you tried buying the new songs yet?

326
00:30:32,426 --> 00:30:35,608
[SPEAKER_19]: I hear that you can buy five new songs for five bucks right now on Xbox Live.

327
00:30:35,628 --> 00:30:36,329
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, you can.

328
00:30:36,449 --> 00:30:42,334
[SPEAKER_20]: I actually haven't had a chance to do it yet because my Cat5 cable is not long enough to reach my Xboxes, so I've got to do it somewhere.

329
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:43,855
[SPEAKER_20]: I might do it tonight before I leave here.

330
00:30:44,555 --> 00:30:45,156
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh.

331
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:48,559
[SPEAKER_20]: Or maybe I can do it by the end of the show since we have a spare cable.

332
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:49,139
[SPEAKER_19]: That would be interesting.

333
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:50,360
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, actually, we have a spare cable.

334
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,401
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe we could buy the songs.

335
00:30:52,482 --> 00:30:54,183
[SPEAKER_19]: I can do it with no problem.

336
00:30:54,223 --> 00:30:55,244
[SPEAKER_20]: I have it all set up to do it.

337
00:30:55,344 --> 00:30:55,684
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

338
00:30:56,225 --> 00:30:57,025
[SPEAKER_20]: So we'll see what comes out.

339
00:30:57,125 --> 00:30:58,947
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if they're selling characters yet, though.

340
00:30:59,127 --> 00:31:00,008
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think they're selling characters.

341
00:31:00,028 --> 00:31:02,230
[SPEAKER_19]: I've only heard that they have the five songs so far for sale.

342
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,672
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, but there are a couple new songs.

343
00:31:04,692 --> 00:31:05,152
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you remember?

344
00:31:06,153 --> 00:31:08,355
[SPEAKER_19]: There was, uh, wasn't Love Will?

345
00:31:08,415 --> 00:31:09,176
[SPEAKER_19]: No, there was some...

346
00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:15,453
[SPEAKER_19]: In My Eyes is in it, and, um, crap, I can't remember the other one.

347
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:15,913
[SPEAKER_19]: Mine Parasite.

348
00:31:16,173 --> 00:31:21,457
[SPEAKER_19]: Mine Parasite, and then there was, like, Burning Heat, um, Burn on the Floor, and, like, some other thing.

349
00:31:21,477 --> 00:31:27,041
[SPEAKER_19]: I heard from what they're gonna try to do is throw as much Extreme stuff in it as possible, as Konami of Japan will allow you.

350
00:31:27,081 --> 00:31:29,423
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, Colors for Extreme is in here, it's an unlock.

351
00:31:29,463 --> 00:31:30,504
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I know that.

352
00:31:30,664 --> 00:31:31,644
[SPEAKER_20]: I've heard, I've heard that.

353
00:31:31,685 --> 00:31:36,328
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a couple I've heard, but I really wanna see how well they do it.

354
00:31:38,652 --> 00:31:42,595
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd also heard that Santa Muerte, the BLT style from Force Style is in there too.

355
00:31:43,155 --> 00:31:44,576
[SPEAKER_19]: That would be a fun unlock, I think.

356
00:31:44,817 --> 00:31:57,166
[SPEAKER_20]: The problem with the unlocks on here, and it's not even so much a problem, it's like, after you play one song, which anyone who plays this probably won't mind knowing, the Metal Gear song from Beatmania, it's the first song you unlock.

357
00:31:58,407 --> 00:32:06,794
[SPEAKER_19]: You unlock Santa, if I remember correctly, by, I think, double-a-ing or passing Santa on all difficulties.

358
00:32:07,295 --> 00:32:07,535
[SPEAKER_21]: Really?

359
00:32:07,855 --> 00:32:07,995
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

360
00:32:08,015 --> 00:32:08,976
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll have to try that.

361
00:32:09,757 --> 00:32:11,078
[SPEAKER_20]: I also know that there's some...

362
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,361
[SPEAKER_20]: There is supposedly an unlock everything code, like how 2DX had.

363
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:20,764
[SPEAKER_20]: If you got 573 or something like that, it would unlock everything.

364
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:28,768
[SPEAKER_20]: There's supposedly something like that on the Xbox, though I'm not sure exactly how they plan on having it done.

365
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,202
[SPEAKER_20]: I wouldn't say Ultramix is better than the Extreme Japanese yet.

366
00:32:35,023 --> 00:32:37,525
[SPEAKER_20]: Because it doesn't have as many songs.

367
00:32:37,925 --> 00:32:41,408
[SPEAKER_20]: Out of the box, it's got like 38 songs.

368
00:32:41,448 --> 00:32:43,010
[SPEAKER_20]: And you can only unlock like 9 more.

369
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,112
[SPEAKER_19]: Which, that's the real assy part about it.

370
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:48,494
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what though?

371
00:32:48,594 --> 00:32:50,376
[SPEAKER_19]: It's all credit for Ultramix.

372
00:32:50,696 --> 00:32:52,858
[SPEAKER_19]: It's great because it's like new.

373
00:32:52,978 --> 00:32:55,020
[SPEAKER_19]: They've made old stuff look really new.

374
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,641
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, you know, they've kind of...

375
00:32:57,722 --> 00:33:01,005
[SPEAKER_19]: Redone the interface, and like Loki said, the stage select music is awesome.

376
00:33:01,025 --> 00:33:04,908
[SPEAKER_19]: They have some innovative new modes with the whole live play and the four player thing.

377
00:33:05,389 --> 00:33:07,370
[SPEAKER_19]: They've really taken steps in the right direction.

378
00:33:07,411 --> 00:33:10,653
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got to totally credit Konami of Hawaii making an interesting DDR mix.

379
00:33:11,474 --> 00:33:18,220
[SPEAKER_19]: Supposedly also there's a mode with the arrows where if you step on a certain arrow it gives more life to your life bar or something like that too.

380
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,902
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, it's supposedly one of the unlockable modes.

381
00:33:21,102 --> 00:33:22,584
[SPEAKER_20]: There's supposed to be two new unlockable modes.

382
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,185
[SPEAKER_20]: I just don't know about it yet.

383
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:30,710
[SPEAKER_20]: But yeah, I mean, this mix all together is shaping up to be really good if they keep up on those downloads.

384
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:48,944
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, it's really cool if they do have five new songs, but what I don't want to see is they go, you know, maybe a few weeks, because it's supposed to be like every two weeks I think they're going to do that, or once a month, and what'll be stupid is if they drop it after two months and they never do it, because I don't think they will for the fact they can make the money.

385
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:53,116
[SPEAKER_20]: But, you know, it's happened with stuff like that before.

386
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:54,756
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see, the unlockables.

387
00:33:54,856 --> 00:34:01,118
[SPEAKER_19]: They've got, of course, the Metal Gear Solid 2 Mission R by LED from Beatmania.

388
00:34:01,718 --> 00:34:04,538
[SPEAKER_19]: To unlock that, you get any grade of an A on any song.

389
00:34:05,078 --> 00:34:07,979
[SPEAKER_19]: Gradient 6 Cyber by Taka.

390
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,099
[SPEAKER_19]: That's another unlock.

391
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,080
[SPEAKER_19]: Double A any song.

392
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,200
[SPEAKER_19]: Put Your Faith in Me Saturday Night Mix.

393
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,420
[SPEAKER_19]: Quit a song.

394
00:34:14,381 --> 00:34:15,701
[SPEAKER_19]: I quit it because my phone rang.

395
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:17,822
[SPEAKER_19]: and Paranoia Rebirth.

396
00:34:18,262 --> 00:34:21,763
[SPEAKER_19]: Get a C or higher for Paranoia Eternal on all three difficulties.

397
00:34:23,264 --> 00:34:24,204
[SPEAKER_19]: Colors for Extreme.

398
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:25,844
[SPEAKER_19]: Play a lot of songs.

399
00:34:27,545 --> 00:34:28,805
[SPEAKER_19]: It starts getting like that.

400
00:34:29,726 --> 00:34:31,126
[SPEAKER_19]: Healing Vision and Angelic Mix.

401
00:34:31,206 --> 00:34:34,087
[SPEAKER_19]: Get a C or higher for Healing Vision on all three difficulties.

402
00:34:34,528 --> 00:34:35,908
[SPEAKER_19]: Santa Mor... whatever.

403
00:34:36,268 --> 00:34:37,929
[SPEAKER_19]: The BLT style for Santa is...

404
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:44,374
[SPEAKER_19]: Gasee or higher for any Santa song, or for Santa on all three difficulties.

405
00:34:44,855 --> 00:34:53,062
[SPEAKER_19]: Max 300, AAA any song or pass it on Roulette, and Orion 78 Civilization Mix Beat Challenge Mode.

406
00:34:54,063 --> 00:34:54,964
[SPEAKER_19]: Those are all the unlocks.

407
00:34:54,984 --> 00:34:58,387
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, that's good unlock stuff, though, right there.

408
00:34:59,027 --> 00:35:01,550
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just curious to see what they're going to sell.

409
00:35:03,311 --> 00:35:04,873
[SPEAKER_20]: If they sell any of the other Maxes or anything.

410
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:11,734
[SPEAKER_19]: I still don't like the idea of unlocking old songs, but since this is Xbox's first mix, we'll let it slide.

411
00:35:11,894 --> 00:35:14,735
[SPEAKER_19]: And the fact that there is some really good stuff that you do unlock in there.

412
00:35:14,955 --> 00:35:18,958
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the one concern, though, is how people are going to cheat the system.

413
00:35:21,446 --> 00:35:25,972
[SPEAKER_02]: and the only... I think that people are going to find a way to do it, though.

414
00:35:26,532 --> 00:35:27,113
[SPEAKER_02]: To copy them.

415
00:35:27,934 --> 00:35:29,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I would encourage it, you know.

416
00:35:29,396 --> 00:35:31,678
[SPEAKER_02]: I would expect for people to... To copy the downloads?

417
00:35:32,019 --> 00:35:33,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.

418
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:37,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what we do for Phantasy Star with the Game Shark.

419
00:35:37,866 --> 00:35:38,546
[SPEAKER_02]: And a laptop.

420
00:35:38,626 --> 00:35:39,087
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all you need.

421
00:35:43,522 --> 00:35:52,788
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I'd just like to encourage, you know, for anyone who's listening who has the game or plans on getting it for the Xbox, go ahead and buy your downloads.

422
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:56,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't, you know, don't try to cheat the system.

423
00:35:56,991 --> 00:35:57,411
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case.

424
00:36:00,069 --> 00:36:03,170
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, because then they'll make new DDRs and blah blah blah, everybody's happy.

425
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:13,334
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, for the symbol case, I mean, you bought, I mean, if you're buying Xbox, if you're buying the Xbox version, obviously you're buying it so you can play online and so you can download new songs.

426
00:36:13,914 --> 00:36:24,158
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, if you're gonna sit there and steal the songs, then what's gonna end up happening is they're gonna be like, oh, well, we're not making enough profit off this game, so there's absolutely no reason for us to make another game.

427
00:36:24,258 --> 00:36:26,659
[SPEAKER_20]: Then DDR will be dead and it'll be all your fault!

428
00:36:27,259 --> 00:36:30,922
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I mean, this is a really cool game.

429
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:35,106
[SPEAKER_20]: And if you make it so another one's not going to come out, I'm going to come out and personally kick your ass.

430
00:36:35,926 --> 00:36:36,827
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what I'm hoping?

431
00:36:37,888 --> 00:36:44,353
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm thinking, this may be a way out here statement that I'm going to get my butt kicked for.

432
00:36:45,975 --> 00:36:48,096
[SPEAKER_19]: Way out there statement I'm going to get my butt kicked for.

433
00:36:48,176 --> 00:36:55,843
[SPEAKER_19]: But maybe if DDR is successful enough on the Xbox, Microsoft will have the balls to tell them to bring 2DX over here.

434
00:36:57,042 --> 00:36:57,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Pray, pray, hope, hope

435
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:29,882
[SPEAKER_19]: Rumor is, now take this with grain of salt, rumor is apparently this was published in some Konami newsletter in Japan this week.

436
00:37:30,462 --> 00:37:32,443
[SPEAKER_19]: Seven styles on its way, 80 songs.

437
00:37:33,383 --> 00:37:33,963
[SPEAKER_19]: So we'll see.

438
00:37:34,223 --> 00:37:34,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy.

439
00:37:34,763 --> 00:37:38,385
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't know any details yet, but we will keep our eyes posted.

440
00:37:38,805 --> 00:37:43,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know what I was thinking that could be possible for them to do, especially on Xbox?

441
00:37:44,147 --> 00:37:44,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Keyboard mania.

442
00:37:45,628 --> 00:37:48,329
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a US keyboard mania release for PC.

443
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:58,301
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember we talked about it on one show here and information was scarce as it is so it was a really under-promoted thing.

444
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just think about it.

445
00:37:59,481 --> 00:38:02,263
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's on the PC, it can go on the Xbox, no problem.

446
00:38:02,483 --> 00:38:02,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

447
00:38:03,464 --> 00:38:08,427
[SPEAKER_02]: So, perhaps they might decide to try that one.

448
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:16,373
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be the way Keyboard Mania was, a very small market, but bring it out, put enough of a price tag on it, and they'll make their money back.

449
00:38:16,413 --> 00:38:21,377
[SPEAKER_19]: I know, if there was enough interest to keep that PC one alive when we barely know anything about it,

450
00:38:22,117 --> 00:38:25,498
[SPEAKER_19]: and, you know, some people actually consider our station a source of news.

451
00:38:25,698 --> 00:38:25,999
[SPEAKER_19]: Shock.

452
00:38:26,999 --> 00:38:28,059
[SPEAKER_19]: We barely know anything about it.

453
00:38:28,099 --> 00:38:31,141
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know how this Keyboard Mania thing is making its money on PC.

454
00:38:31,801 --> 00:38:39,004
[SPEAKER_20]: One last thing about the Ultra Mix that's kind of cool is if you have a metal pad for the PlayStation 2,

455
00:38:40,465 --> 00:38:52,775
[SPEAKER_20]: You can go to Fry's or whatever your main heavy hitter electronics store is and buy a little $20 adapter and you can use it on the Xbox because it actually does work because it's mapped out to the buttons.

456
00:38:53,596 --> 00:39:02,884
[SPEAKER_20]: So you can actually use your metal pads or even if you don't want to spend the money on a new Microsoft pad and you have PlayStation 1s laying all around, spend $21.74 and go and buy an adapter.

457
00:39:08,157 --> 00:39:09,919
[SPEAKER_20]: And you can play all your games.

458
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:18,646
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's really worth it for the fact that, I mean, some people also don't like the Xbox controller for pretty much anything, or fighting games and stuff.

459
00:39:19,127 --> 00:39:20,928
[SPEAKER_21]: You can always use the PlayStation controller, too.

460
00:39:20,988 --> 00:39:21,609
[SPEAKER_20]: It's worth using.

461
00:39:24,452 --> 00:39:24,792
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

462
00:39:24,812 --> 00:39:29,436
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys want to take a break, or you want to just go into some how was your week, how was your day?

463
00:39:29,456 --> 00:39:31,518
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I know we've got a lot to talk about here.

464
00:39:32,782 --> 00:39:39,684
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, well, Jamie, you were gone for some time here Two whole weeks Two whole weeks, that's a long time, you know

465
00:39:40,765 --> 00:39:41,705
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, how was your month?

466
00:39:41,745 --> 00:39:42,506
[SPEAKER_19]: How was your day?

467
00:39:43,686 --> 00:39:48,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Mara and Sean went with me to Alabama.

468
00:39:49,228 --> 00:39:50,309
[SPEAKER_02]: We stayed at my grandmother's place.

469
00:39:50,849 --> 00:40:03,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, it was a lot of running around in my grandma's car and finding people and seeing old friends and visiting and doing some gaming, which made me happy because I haven't done any gaming since the last time I was in Alabama.

470
00:40:04,874 --> 00:40:10,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to see a lot of people I really missed.

471
00:40:10,176 --> 00:40:11,637
[SPEAKER_02]: We watched so many movies while I was there.

472
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:13,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally saw The Ring.

473
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:14,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally.

474
00:40:15,598 --> 00:40:16,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Multiple times while I was there.

475
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,801
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we rented Ringu and it was okay, but I like The Ring.

476
00:40:23,161 --> 00:40:28,403
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we saw Scary Movie 3 and Kill Bill again.

477
00:40:29,244 --> 00:40:31,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And the third Matrix movie, which was...

478
00:40:35,454 --> 00:40:42,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, which everything in that movie happened exactly how I expected it to except for the very end, which I'm not going to spoil for anybody.

479
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:53,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm not answering any questions on that.

480
00:40:53,668 --> 00:40:57,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he turns into a bunny and scampers off into the sunset.

481
00:40:58,592 --> 00:40:58,632
Um,

482
00:41:00,413 --> 00:41:05,554
[SPEAKER_19]: And you thought all those how far does the rabbit hole thing go was all just like, you know, metaphors.

483
00:41:05,994 --> 00:41:08,374
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh-uh.

484
00:41:08,494 --> 00:41:14,676
[SPEAKER_02]: He was going on a skateboard in a little, you know, vest with a pocket watch going, I'm late.

485
00:41:16,896 --> 00:41:20,797
[SPEAKER_19]: He was fighting Smith and then all of a sudden the wild stallions come in.

486
00:41:22,517 --> 00:41:27,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, all of a sudden Alex Winter shows up like, dude, we're in the wrong movie.

487
00:41:30,031 --> 00:41:30,611
[SPEAKER_22]: Kill me now.

488
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:33,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

489
00:41:37,957 --> 00:41:41,840
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I really wanted to go to the French Quarter while I was there, but I didn't get to.

490
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:49,845
[SPEAKER_02]: We just got into New Orleans, drove back, although we did eat at a really nice buffet at the Beaurevage in Biloxi.

491
00:41:50,846 --> 00:41:51,607
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was free.

492
00:41:53,708 --> 00:41:57,251
[SPEAKER_02]: And, let's see, I played DDR at Cyber Station.

493
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,040
[SPEAKER_02]: The Dance Maniacs machine is gone and that made me cry.

494
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:02,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

495
00:42:02,922 --> 00:42:06,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and the DDR machine there was kind of crap.

496
00:42:08,686 --> 00:42:15,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I twisted my knee playing on that machine, but then again I hadn't played any DDR for a month because of that nasty sinus infection I had.

497
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:19,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I never got a chance to go find the Beatmania machine.

498
00:42:19,556 --> 00:42:20,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I found out where it is.

499
00:42:21,737 --> 00:42:22,717
[SPEAKER_02]: It was at the mall.

500
00:42:22,737 --> 00:42:23,998
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to work at it, Springdale Mall.

501
00:42:24,738 --> 00:42:26,738
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're renovating the mall.

502
00:42:26,758 --> 00:42:28,339
[SPEAKER_02]: They're rebuilding the whole center of it.

503
00:42:28,419 --> 00:42:35,140
[SPEAKER_02]: So they moved the machine, actually, to a little, I think it's like a network gaming place slash arcade.

504
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:43,962
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's over, for anyone who lives in that area who might be listening to the show, it's on Moffett Road by University.

505
00:42:44,502 --> 00:42:46,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Just this little sort of hole-in-the-wall gaming place.

506
00:42:46,642 --> 00:42:47,583
[SPEAKER_02]: But I didn't get a chance to go.

507
00:42:47,843 --> 00:42:48,823
[SPEAKER_19]: I have an off-topic question.

508
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:49,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

509
00:42:49,921 --> 00:42:51,762
[SPEAKER_19]: What is up with those networking gaming places?

510
00:42:51,782 --> 00:42:55,484
[SPEAKER_19]: I've seen them popping up everywhere lately, like here in Sacramento, where Orange Orange is based.

511
00:42:55,944 --> 00:42:59,025
[SPEAKER_19]: I've seen at least three brand new network gaming places in the area.

512
00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:01,687
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one that we passed on the way up here.

513
00:43:02,607 --> 00:43:03,768
[SPEAKER_19]: Are they really that popular?

514
00:43:03,828 --> 00:43:04,728
[SPEAKER_19]: I've never been to one in my life.

515
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,809
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to go the way of the dot-com business.

516
00:43:07,529 --> 00:43:08,530
[SPEAKER_19]: They're like QZAR to me.

517
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:12,552
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not talking bad about QZAR.

518
00:43:12,572 --> 00:43:17,454
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just saying QZAR is everywhere for about a year, and then suddenly they all disappear like that.

519
00:43:19,861 --> 00:43:28,623
[SPEAKER_19]: That's because Kezar Corporate went under, and then all the places stopped, you know, they stopped making the things, and now you have to play with the guns that are already built.

520
00:43:29,744 --> 00:43:31,184
[SPEAKER_19]: Different reasons, same outcome.

521
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:31,924
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, Jamie.

522
00:43:32,044 --> 00:43:33,264
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, yeah.

523
00:43:34,285 --> 00:43:39,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, anyway, uh, I have completely forgot where I was, thank you very much.

524
00:43:39,318 --> 00:43:42,059
[SPEAKER_19]: You were playing DDR in the Beatmania Machine.

525
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I never got to play the Beatmania Machine.

526
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,301
[SPEAKER_02]: What I had been told was a sixth mix, and I wanted to play it.

527
00:43:49,642 --> 00:44:00,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I took my mom out to dinner for her birthday at the original Oyster House, which is like the best seafood place in the universe.

528
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:05,087
[SPEAKER_02]: All the seafood that they cook there is all locally caught stuff.

529
00:44:05,567 --> 00:44:06,247
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really yummy.

530
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:08,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Fresh catfish and... Wait, wait, wait, wait.

531
00:44:09,258 --> 00:44:09,999
[SPEAKER_02]: All kinds of food.

532
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:11,300
[SPEAKER_19]: Better than Red Lobster?

533
00:44:12,061 --> 00:44:19,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Red Lobster, okay, Red Lobster's good, but nothing beats fish caught in the Gulf.

534
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:27,339
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to say this, you eat seafood out here, all the West Coast seafood, does not taste as good as seafood caught on the East Coast.

535
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:28,500
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, it does not.

536
00:44:30,593 --> 00:44:33,934
[SPEAKER_02]: It has this sort of weird flavor to it.

537
00:44:35,235 --> 00:44:37,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Real seafood is in the south.

538
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:44,218
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got to eat fried okra, which made me happy because nobody out here knows how to cook fried okra right?

539
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:46,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they make it all slimy and icky.

540
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:48,640
[SPEAKER_02]: I ate the Cracker Barrel.

541
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:53,802
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me sick because I'm not used to country cooking anymore.

542
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,242
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was pretty good.

543
00:44:58,462 --> 00:44:58,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoyed it.

544
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:01,965
[SPEAKER_02]: What else did I do?

545
00:45:01,985 --> 00:45:03,767
[SPEAKER_02]: We rented lots of movies, like I said.

546
00:45:04,267 --> 00:45:05,628
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to see Undercover Brother.

547
00:45:05,648 --> 00:45:07,070
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like the funniest movie ever.

548
00:45:11,113 --> 00:45:12,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really much else happened.

549
00:45:12,455 --> 00:45:13,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, we went to Walmart a lot.

550
00:45:14,857 --> 00:45:15,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Walmart.

551
00:45:15,958 --> 00:45:16,959
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two of them.

552
00:45:17,899 --> 00:45:19,321
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so happy because I loved Super Walmart.

553
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:21,283
[SPEAKER_18]: Now I've heard that associated with the South before.

554
00:45:22,022 --> 00:45:24,464
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, well, they can't have Super Walmarts out here.

555
00:45:24,485 --> 00:45:26,326
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like one, and it's in, what, Chico.

556
00:45:26,647 --> 00:45:28,429
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, they're going to open a Super Walmart in Chico.

557
00:45:28,709 --> 00:45:32,292
[SPEAKER_19]: But Chico is, you know, just like most rural parts of the nation, so.

558
00:45:32,433 --> 00:45:34,575
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, well, Mobile's hardly rural.

559
00:45:35,115 --> 00:45:37,718
[SPEAKER_19]: I know, but, I don't know how to put it.

560
00:45:37,958 --> 00:45:38,279
[SPEAKER_19]: Forget it.

561
00:45:38,439 --> 00:45:42,443
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, but then maybe it's this College Town thing, I don't know.

562
00:45:43,884 --> 00:45:44,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

563
00:45:44,205 --> 00:45:45,426
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, the, uh.

564
00:45:47,557 --> 00:45:49,680
[SPEAKER_02]: We went there like practically every night.

565
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:53,004
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, we're bored, let's go to Walmart.

566
00:45:53,965 --> 00:45:55,047
[SPEAKER_19]: It reminds me of college.

567
00:45:56,201 --> 00:45:59,903
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was going to school, it was Walmart or Bruno's, the grocery store to go get liquor.

568
00:46:00,263 --> 00:46:00,884
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I'm sorry.

569
00:46:03,425 --> 00:46:04,686
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my transcripts from school.

570
00:46:05,286 --> 00:46:06,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, so I can go back to school.

571
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, this pisses me off.

572
00:46:07,927 --> 00:46:09,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I ordered two copies of my transcripts.

573
00:46:10,028 --> 00:46:11,229
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, two sealed copies.

574
00:46:11,729 --> 00:46:15,411
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I go to one school and want to go to the other, I can have both of those copies.

575
00:46:16,672 --> 00:46:17,672
[SPEAKER_02]: They only sent me one of them.

576
00:46:18,273 --> 00:46:20,754
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have to call them and bitch and fuss and moan.

577
00:46:21,855 --> 00:46:22,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Complain, complain.

578
00:46:23,355 --> 00:46:23,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

579
00:46:24,856 --> 00:46:26,840
[SPEAKER_02]: The flight back was bumpy.

580
00:46:28,542 --> 00:46:32,769
[SPEAKER_02]: We went through this torrent right before we got into New Orleans.

581
00:46:33,631 --> 00:46:35,974
[SPEAKER_02]: There was an accident and it was all kind of crappy.

582
00:46:36,615 --> 00:46:38,979
[SPEAKER_02]: But our flights left within five minutes of each other.

583
00:46:40,023 --> 00:46:45,225
[SPEAKER_02]: We had everything timed so well, you know, when our flights were leaving and everything.

584
00:46:45,486 --> 00:46:52,669
[SPEAKER_02]: The ride to Denver was bumpy, the flight to Sacramento was pretty smooth, and then I got in town and was like, hey, it's cold.

585
00:46:53,249 --> 00:46:56,951
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, Mobile has the most bipolar weather ever.

586
00:46:57,958 --> 00:47:00,199
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I'm hot, I'm cold, I'm hot, I'm cold, I'm hot, I'm cold.

587
00:47:00,219 --> 00:47:01,339
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like menopause or something.

588
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:05,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, it was really kind of warm.

589
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, it was humid the whole time.

590
00:47:07,981 --> 00:47:12,923
[SPEAKER_02]: But around Thursday-ish, it got really cold, like in the 50s or so.

591
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:14,103
[SPEAKER_02]: It was coat weather.

592
00:47:14,243 --> 00:47:16,144
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Monday, hi, I'm hot.

593
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:17,204
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 80.

594
00:47:18,104 --> 00:47:18,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, the sun's out.

595
00:47:20,365 --> 00:47:21,685
[SPEAKER_02]: And people drive really slow there.

596
00:47:23,386 --> 00:47:23,546
[SPEAKER_02]: And...

597
00:47:26,297 --> 00:47:34,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I came back feeling really happy That's the best place anyone can go for a vacation because it's relaxing

598
00:47:35,422 --> 00:47:37,303
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's going to rush you or anything.

599
00:47:39,084 --> 00:47:40,165
[SPEAKER_02]: People are polite.

600
00:47:41,126 --> 00:47:42,146
[SPEAKER_02]: California sucks.

601
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:48,330
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's more to do here, but I think the vast majority of people out here just suck.

602
00:47:49,271 --> 00:47:52,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I said vast majority, not everybody.

603
00:47:53,053 --> 00:47:58,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course the people that I associate with, that I consider my friends, are in the non-suck portion of the community.

604
00:47:58,757 --> 00:47:59,417
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, okay.

605
00:48:00,198 --> 00:48:01,979
[SPEAKER_02]: But most everybody else...

606
00:48:03,566 --> 00:48:05,407
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not as many polite people.

607
00:48:06,088 --> 00:48:14,593
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's going to smile at you when you walk down the road or nod their head high or hold a door for you or be considerate.

608
00:48:14,673 --> 00:48:16,254
[SPEAKER_02]: People are too much in a hurry.

609
00:48:16,514 --> 00:48:18,135
[SPEAKER_19]: I smile at other people when I've gotten a raise.

610
00:48:18,216 --> 00:48:20,797
[SPEAKER_02]: And they probably look at you like you just escaped from the asylum.

611
00:48:20,857 --> 00:48:22,638
[SPEAKER_19]: Like when I've gotten a raise at work or something.

612
00:48:27,261 --> 00:48:31,064
[SPEAKER_02]: You never see the difference until you've been away from it for so long.

613
00:48:32,558 --> 00:48:38,722
[SPEAKER_02]: That it was just, I don't know, it was sort of almost disappointing to come back.

614
00:48:39,242 --> 00:48:40,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost disappointing.

615
00:48:40,943 --> 00:48:44,926
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, this is of course where my home is and I couldn't imagine living anywhere else.

616
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:52,571
[SPEAKER_02]: But still it was just, I found myself getting homesick right when I got off the plane so it was really weird.

617
00:48:54,156 --> 00:48:59,621
[SPEAKER_02]: And as for my day, I got back and decided to try the test server for Ragnarok.

618
00:49:00,341 --> 00:49:03,004
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm on the Sakurai server, enjoying it.

619
00:49:05,105 --> 00:49:09,189
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm supposed to be finishing up the last chapter of my fanfic, but I've only barely started it.

620
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:14,513
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, work was work.

621
00:49:15,194 --> 00:49:21,960
[SPEAKER_02]: One good thing, though, I realized once I counted everything up, I only worked six days this entire month.

622
00:49:22,864 --> 00:49:24,344
[SPEAKER_02]: But you get paid for it all, right?

623
00:49:24,564 --> 00:49:25,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hell yeah.

624
00:49:25,405 --> 00:49:25,945
[SPEAKER_20]: Right on.

625
00:49:26,345 --> 00:49:31,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we got two holidays this month, my vacation, and plus we get two days off for Thanksgiving.

626
00:49:32,946 --> 00:49:34,187
[SPEAKER_02]: So it works out cool for me.

627
00:49:36,727 --> 00:49:37,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else?

628
00:49:37,127 --> 00:49:38,028
[SPEAKER_08]: I am glad to be back.

629
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:38,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't get me wrong.

630
00:49:38,928 --> 00:49:39,428
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome back.

631
00:49:39,648 --> 00:49:41,368
[SPEAKER_02]: I am glad to be back.

632
00:49:41,908 --> 00:49:44,529
[SPEAKER_19]: You didn't miss a lot on the show, just Loki singing.

633
00:49:45,769 --> 00:49:46,089
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, good.

634
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:50,811
[SPEAKER_19]: Anything else you want to share?

635
00:49:51,111 --> 00:49:51,991
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

636
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:52,311
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki.

637
00:49:53,635 --> 00:49:54,075
[SPEAKER_19]: How was your day?

638
00:49:54,115 --> 00:49:54,516
[SPEAKER_19]: How was your week?

639
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,677
[SPEAKER_19]: Today was okay until the power went out.

640
00:49:57,777 --> 00:50:02,660
[SPEAKER_21]: Then I went down to Golfland to meet with Keith again to show him something that he wanted to see.

641
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:06,362
[SPEAKER_19]: He wanted to see the iPack to see how big it was.

642
00:50:06,442 --> 00:50:08,624
[SPEAKER_19]: So I went down there to go see him and he wasn't there again.

643
00:50:08,744 --> 00:50:09,124
[SPEAKER_19]: Surprise.

644
00:50:09,704 --> 00:50:19,850
[SPEAKER_19]: So I ended up playing some Guitar Freaks and some 4th Plus and No Extreme and a little bit of F-Zero.

645
00:50:22,032 --> 00:50:31,486
[SPEAKER_19]: and earlier this week I was still set on my computer getting it all working fine I'm busy in the I'm kind of in the process of right now of

646
00:50:33,018 --> 00:50:39,021
[SPEAKER_19]: Getting my copies of certain programs that I don't own to put them on my computer.

647
00:50:39,221 --> 00:50:42,843
[SPEAKER_19]: So I was busy downloading my updated software and all that.

648
00:50:43,723 --> 00:50:46,865
[SPEAKER_19]: I got a few other games I need to try out.

649
00:50:46,885 --> 00:50:50,567
[SPEAKER_19]: I just got Simpsons Hit and Run, which looks pretty good.

650
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:54,389
[SPEAKER_19]: And then Celebrity Deathmatch, which looks kind of fun.

651
00:50:55,169 --> 00:50:59,151
[SPEAKER_19]: And then Midnight Club 2 didn't work for me.

652
00:50:59,371 --> 00:51:00,872
[SPEAKER_21]: For some reason, the image...

653
00:51:01,172 --> 00:51:01,673
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been working on

654
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:16,366
[SPEAKER_19]: A list of something for a secret something that I'll be doing later.

655
00:51:17,047 --> 00:51:19,948
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't really say right now because I just can't.

656
00:51:20,108 --> 00:51:21,748
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not close to completion yet.

657
00:51:22,429 --> 00:51:29,411
[SPEAKER_19]: But on this list right now there's a good over 600 things on this list.

658
00:51:29,591 --> 00:51:31,912
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's a long list that I need to work on.

659
00:51:33,573 --> 00:51:37,855
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyways, so I've been doing that and I was going to work on the webpage.

660
00:51:39,517 --> 00:51:41,618
[SPEAKER_19]: Orange Lounge, but I never got around to it.

661
00:51:42,138 --> 00:51:44,099
[SPEAKER_19]: And... Yeah.

662
00:51:44,459 --> 00:51:48,761
[SPEAKER_19]: And also... Yeah, I don't know.

663
00:51:49,081 --> 00:51:50,741
[SPEAKER_19]: My show's in limbo right now, too.

664
00:51:51,562 --> 00:51:54,283
[SPEAKER_19]: So... I don't know.

665
00:51:54,683 --> 00:51:55,363
[SPEAKER_19]: It's been like that.

666
00:51:55,503 --> 00:51:57,184
[SPEAKER_19]: Kind of like a whole week's been in limbo.

667
00:51:58,984 --> 00:51:59,645
[SPEAKER_19]: That's pretty much it.

668
00:52:01,545 --> 00:52:01,825
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

669
00:52:02,186 --> 00:52:04,646
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, more programming notes to come after the next break.

670
00:52:04,666 --> 00:52:08,268
[SPEAKER_19]: There's some important programming notes that we'll need to get out of the way and take care of.

671
00:52:09,249 --> 00:52:10,329
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for watching!

672
00:52:32,534 --> 00:52:47,185
[SPEAKER_19]: I went out to Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation over downtown, and it's the third year in a row I've gone, and there's some pretty funny shit this year, namely the ninjas was funny, and what else was there that was good?

673
00:52:47,705 --> 00:52:51,048
[SPEAKER_19]: Something about this giant stick figure that was a condom, that was pretty good.

674
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:54,991
[SPEAKER_19]: Happy Tree Friends, as always, was a winner, but the best...

675
00:52:55,899 --> 00:52:58,860
[SPEAKER_19]: By far, here comes Dr. Tran.

676
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:01,120
[SPEAKER_19]: Fucking hilarious.

677
00:53:01,881 --> 00:53:10,783
[SPEAKER_19]: If you want to visit www.beyondgrandpa.com and get all the information on, oh shit, it's Dr. Tran, it's great and would be well worth your visit.

678
00:53:11,183 --> 00:53:11,803
[SPEAKER_19]: So that was fun.

679
00:53:12,883 --> 00:53:16,564
[SPEAKER_19]: And then yesterday I hung out with Jamie for a while where we worked on a couple of the new promos you'll be hearing.

680
00:53:17,244 --> 00:53:20,725
[SPEAKER_19]: And got to see my buddy Eddie who's in from out of town.

681
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:22,766
[SPEAKER_19]: Made some home movies.

682
00:53:23,086 --> 00:53:23,406
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

683
00:53:23,886 --> 00:53:24,407
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura.com

684
00:53:46,009 --> 00:53:55,950
[SPEAKER_19]: and my eyes started hurting which kind of sucked but I took Tylenol and it's better now and I'm hoping I didn't catch whatever LankyStyle had because he had an eye infection the other day but

685
00:53:57,139 --> 00:53:58,540
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think it was Pink Eye though.

686
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:01,342
[SPEAKER_19]: It was just something where the eyes were like really, really hurting.

687
00:54:01,422 --> 00:54:01,763
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

688
00:54:02,283 --> 00:54:05,225
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think I'm okay because I took Tylenol and I feel better.

689
00:54:05,345 --> 00:54:07,247
[SPEAKER_19]: So maybe it was just psychological.

690
00:54:07,307 --> 00:54:07,667
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

691
00:54:09,368 --> 00:54:12,591
[SPEAKER_19]: So that was pretty much my week and my day.

692
00:54:14,032 --> 00:54:19,115
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, Zero or Miko, you guys have anything you want to share about your week and your day?

693
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,636
[SPEAKER_19]: We haven't heard from Miko much this show.

694
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:23,839
[SPEAKER_19]: Does she have anything you want to share anything about your week and your day?

695
00:54:27,495 --> 00:54:32,939
[SPEAKER_19]: You talk into the microphone, you just say, hi people, and this is what's good and this is what sucks, or whatever.

696
00:54:39,383 --> 00:54:40,143
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, it is on.

697
00:54:40,363 --> 00:54:40,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

698
00:54:41,644 --> 00:54:43,345
[SPEAKER_19]: If you don't talk, they'll make me sing.

699
00:54:43,565 --> 00:54:44,586
[SPEAKER_19]: Please, talk.

700
00:54:44,786 --> 00:54:45,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Sing!

701
00:54:45,307 --> 00:54:45,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes!

702
00:54:45,747 --> 00:54:46,247
[SPEAKER_19]: No!

703
00:54:46,287 --> 00:54:46,567
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes!

704
00:54:46,647 --> 00:54:47,028
[SPEAKER_19]: No!

705
00:54:47,788 --> 00:54:48,989
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki does not sing.

706
00:54:49,029 --> 00:54:52,051
[SPEAKER_19]: We bring that out on special occasions and rating stunts only.

707
00:54:55,873 --> 00:54:56,734
[SPEAKER_19]: What'd you do yesterday?

708
00:54:57,617 --> 00:54:58,758
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember.

709
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:00,620
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you go to Golfland at all this week?

710
00:55:02,121 --> 00:55:03,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Friday.

711
00:55:03,582 --> 00:55:06,625
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you play anything interesting while you were there?

712
00:55:08,686 --> 00:55:10,208
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR Extreme.

713
00:55:11,008 --> 00:55:11,469
[SPEAKER_19]: Right on.

714
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:17,454
[SPEAKER_19]: What was the last big song you passed in DDR Extreme?

715
00:55:18,847 --> 00:55:20,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, Cartoon Heroes!

716
00:55:20,428 --> 00:55:20,868
[SPEAKER_19]: Right on!

717
00:55:21,368 --> 00:55:24,150
[SPEAKER_07]: But I already passed that, like, when it first came out.

718
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:24,630
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh.

719
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:26,271
[SPEAKER_19]: But we just did it again, though.

720
00:55:26,591 --> 00:55:32,314
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, you see, I could pass Cartoon Heroes when it first came out, but then I didn't play DDR for a while, and I started getting... Who's Rice Princess?

721
00:55:33,354 --> 00:55:35,155
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, that is Rice Princess.

722
00:55:36,016 --> 00:55:36,996
[SPEAKER_19]: And she goes to RVGL, too.

723
00:55:37,577 --> 00:55:37,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

724
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:38,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

725
00:55:40,398 --> 00:55:40,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Irene?

726
00:55:42,699 --> 00:55:43,219
Oh, hi!

727
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:49,591
[SPEAKER_19]: Mika looks like a poor deer in the headlights right now with a microphone in her hand.

728
00:55:49,611 --> 00:55:51,031
[SPEAKER_19]: She's like, they can hear me?

729
00:55:51,472 --> 00:55:51,832
[SPEAKER_19]: Can they?

730
00:55:52,552 --> 00:55:53,032
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh my god.

731
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:54,573
Hello, is this thing on?

732
00:55:55,733 --> 00:56:04,996
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what, I could pass Cartoon Heroes when DDR Extreme first came out too and then I didn't go for playing for a long time and I got fat and older and then I couldn't beat it, but I can beat it again.

733
00:56:06,076 --> 00:56:06,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Likewise.

734
00:56:06,737 --> 00:56:07,857
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, but I'll go...

735
00:56:11,508 --> 00:56:17,091
[SPEAKER_19]: After I Beat It, which isn't a lot of fun, so I only do that at birthday parties now and special occasions.

736
00:56:18,772 --> 00:56:23,094
[SPEAKER_19]: So, that being said, anything else you'd like to share with our listeners, Mikael, for now?

737
00:56:23,575 --> 00:56:24,395
[SPEAKER_19]: About your week and your day?

738
00:56:28,697 --> 00:56:29,598
[SPEAKER_19]: What do you think of Ultramix?

739
00:56:31,335 --> 00:56:33,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I think it's cool.

740
00:56:33,776 --> 00:56:34,417
[SPEAKER_19]: It is pretty cool.

741
00:56:34,437 --> 00:56:39,319
[SPEAKER_07]: I just need a pad that needs to be slippery so I can do the moonwalk.

742
00:56:39,519 --> 00:56:40,240
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you have an Xbox?

743
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,481
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but my dad was going to buy me one.

744
00:56:44,342 --> 00:56:45,922
[SPEAKER_19]: I wish my dad would buy me an Xbox.

745
00:56:45,982 --> 00:56:46,423
[SPEAKER_19]: No fair.

746
00:56:46,763 --> 00:56:50,225
[SPEAKER_07]: But my mom said no because she's a loser.

747
00:56:51,485 --> 00:56:52,065
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, no.

748
00:56:53,606 --> 00:56:54,927
[SPEAKER_22]: She just wants what's best for you.

749
00:56:56,368 --> 00:56:58,010
[SPEAKER_22]: Which means less games and more chores.

750
00:56:58,630 --> 00:56:59,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, exactly.

751
00:56:59,611 --> 00:57:02,214
[SPEAKER_07]: I have three jobs, by the way.

752
00:57:02,894 --> 00:57:03,755
[SPEAKER_19]: Dang, what jobs?

753
00:57:04,416 --> 00:57:06,437
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a caregiver downtown.

754
00:57:06,598 --> 00:57:06,958
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

755
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:11,002
[SPEAKER_07]: And I work for 31 Baskin Robbins and Rancho.

756
00:57:11,282 --> 00:57:11,582
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

757
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:14,225
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that the one that's at Dunkin' Donuts, too?

758
00:57:16,478 --> 00:57:17,539
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess not, forget it.

759
00:57:18,139 --> 00:57:21,120
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but we have the coffee dunk by Dunkin' Donuts.

760
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,040
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, good enough.

761
00:57:24,721 --> 00:57:26,521
[SPEAKER_18]: And what's the third one, if you wanted to share?

762
00:57:26,541 --> 00:57:32,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and I work at my school.

763
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:34,644
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

764
00:57:37,525 --> 00:57:38,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Hooray for school.

765
00:57:39,805 --> 00:57:42,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's why I like going to school, because I get paid.

766
00:57:45,089 --> 00:57:45,809
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, right on.

767
00:57:47,370 --> 00:57:49,510
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so let's hear from Zero.

768
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:50,591
[SPEAKER_19]: We haven't heard from Zero yet.

769
00:57:50,651 --> 00:57:53,191
[SPEAKER_19]: How was your week and your day, Mr. Zero?

770
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:53,852
Bleh.

771
00:57:54,232 --> 00:57:55,252
[SPEAKER_21]: No, it was okay.

772
00:57:55,272 --> 00:57:58,193
[SPEAKER_19]: You have your lower lip sticking out like you're pouty about something.

773
00:57:58,573 --> 00:58:03,395
[SPEAKER_21]: I had to spend, like, every dime I had on my piece of shit fucking car.

774
00:58:03,915 --> 00:58:04,035
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh.

775
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:14,118
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I only paid $100 for that car, so I wouldn't feel so bad if I set it in a nice, happy roll and then jumped out and let it crash into a wall or incoming traffic.

776
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:17,440
[SPEAKER_21]: It's... God, my door doesn't shut.

777
00:58:18,321 --> 00:58:19,882
[SPEAKER_21]: So I had to tie it with a shoestring.

778
00:58:23,506 --> 00:58:25,607
[SPEAKER_21]: You're telling me it's ghetto.

779
00:58:25,728 --> 00:58:26,748
[SPEAKER_21]: I know my car's ghetto.

780
00:58:26,789 --> 00:58:31,212
[SPEAKER_21]: Nah, it's something easy to fix, it's just I don't have the 50 bucks for the stuff I need to fix it.

781
00:58:32,273 --> 00:58:41,842
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, I'm kinda pissed off for the fact that it says that the song pack 1 for Ultramix is released and yet they won't update their fucking sites.

782
00:58:42,442 --> 00:58:43,423
[SPEAKER_21]: to tell you what's out.

783
00:58:43,924 --> 00:58:46,627
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a lot of stuff that Xbox Live is screwing up on right now.

784
00:58:46,647 --> 00:58:50,011
[SPEAKER_19]: Somebody had showed me a site that had the X... I thought it was an Xbox site.

785
00:58:50,031 --> 00:58:53,735
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I know it tells... No, it's not... I'll tell you right now it's not Xbox because I'm on it.

786
00:58:53,755 --> 00:58:54,055
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, okay.

787
00:58:54,095 --> 00:58:55,857
[SPEAKER_19]: They're just totally making it look like crap.

788
00:58:56,137 --> 00:58:56,998
[SPEAKER_19]: They're still stuck in...

789
00:58:58,630 --> 00:59:00,350
[SPEAKER_19]: I think you need an Ultramix party.

790
00:59:22,463 --> 00:59:23,424
[SPEAKER_19]: I was thinking about it.

791
00:59:23,584 --> 00:59:27,886
[SPEAKER_19]: I just gotta figure out how to plan it and when to... I mean, I know how to plan it, I just don't know when.

792
00:59:28,347 --> 00:59:29,607
[SPEAKER_19]: I think I need to finish my cabinet.

793
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:30,868
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah?

794
00:59:30,888 --> 00:59:33,049
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

795
00:59:33,389 --> 00:59:37,372
[SPEAKER_19]: I got these two, like, wonderful DDR pads not being used at all.

796
00:59:37,392 --> 00:59:38,833
[SPEAKER_19]: They're just kinda sitting there.

797
00:59:38,973 --> 00:59:40,153
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, you have your coin door.

798
00:59:40,294 --> 00:59:41,114
[SPEAKER_19]: That is hella cool.

799
00:59:41,714 --> 00:59:43,716
[SPEAKER_19]: I have everything, and that's why I'm broke.

800
00:59:44,876 --> 00:59:47,778
[SPEAKER_19]: We're gonna install the coin door into the laundry machine for the meantime.

801
00:59:47,858 --> 00:59:49,039
[SPEAKER_19]: I like that idea.

802
00:59:52,846 --> 00:59:53,908
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a lot of people.

803
00:59:54,148 --> 00:59:57,031
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just a joke.

804
00:59:57,351 --> 01:00:01,256
[SPEAKER_19]: And she cooked us dinner tonight, so do laundry here all you want.

805
01:00:01,376 --> 01:00:03,238
[SPEAKER_19]: Bring fish and you can...

806
01:00:04,437 --> 01:00:06,138
[SPEAKER_21]: Now I know why we couldn't download anything.

807
01:00:06,638 --> 01:00:10,440
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm looking at their service status, and it says that it's down.

808
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:11,421
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, that sucks.

809
01:00:11,681 --> 01:00:14,822
[SPEAKER_21]: And I bet you if I go back to it, it'll say that it's up, and then it'll say it's down.

810
01:00:15,563 --> 01:00:20,685
[SPEAKER_21]: But, um, no, yeah, I want to get everybody together, just to come over and have another B-Money party, because I miss it.

811
01:00:20,845 --> 01:00:23,607
[SPEAKER_19]: But money parties are fun, and I'm sorry I missed your last one.

812
01:00:23,807 --> 01:00:26,508
[SPEAKER_19]: I, um, I think I just was having my period.

813
01:00:26,528 --> 01:00:27,069
[SPEAKER_19]: You didn't miss much.

814
01:00:27,169 --> 01:00:28,629
[SPEAKER_19]: The only person who was there was Garrett.

815
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:35,622
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, Garrett's cool, I know, I know, there's nothing to say he's a bad person, but hardly anybody showed up.

816
01:00:35,802 --> 01:00:37,803
[SPEAKER_21]: It was kind of, yeah.

817
01:00:38,223 --> 01:00:42,045
[SPEAKER_21]: But, um, oh, and my friend Alex from my work came, too.

818
01:00:42,565 --> 01:00:46,927
[SPEAKER_21]: But, um, yeah, I want to try to get something big and just have a bunch of fun.

819
01:00:46,967 --> 01:00:48,948
[SPEAKER_21]: We should do, like, a Christmas party or something.

820
01:00:49,808 --> 01:00:52,970
[SPEAKER_21]: and we could have a gift exchange, wouldn't that be fun?

821
01:00:53,650 --> 01:01:06,476
[SPEAKER_19]: you're the only one who finds that entertaining I think instead of a Christmas party we should have like a Hanukkah party because nobody ever has Hanukkah parties we should make up our own type of holiday everyone else is doing it everyone else is making up a holiday, why not?

822
01:01:07,256 --> 01:01:15,560
[SPEAKER_02]: or a winter solstice yeah, we need the Yule party where we like burn a log or we get the TV log

823
01:01:18,717 --> 01:01:19,278
[SPEAKER_19]: Great.

824
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:20,939
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I don't know.

825
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:26,485
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to get everybody together just because we haven't done it in a long time and every time we get together it's a lot of fun.

826
01:01:30,469 --> 01:01:30,850
[SPEAKER_19]: No idea.

827
01:01:30,910 --> 01:01:32,792
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't know a lot of these people in our chatroom, Miko.

828
01:01:32,812 --> 01:01:33,432
[SPEAKER_19]: They're just there.

829
01:01:33,652 --> 01:01:34,874
[SPEAKER_19]: They just start showing up.

830
01:01:35,134 --> 01:01:37,637
[SPEAKER_19]: They just started showing up and we haven't kicked them out yet, so...

831
01:01:38,823 --> 01:01:40,184
[SPEAKER_19]: There are our neighbors, your friends.

832
01:01:40,244 --> 01:01:41,585
[SPEAKER_19]: No, we love all our new chatters.

833
01:01:41,625 --> 01:01:42,806
[SPEAKER_19]: Hello to all the new chatters.

834
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:47,509
[SPEAKER_19]: I've seen some new faces pop up this past couple weeks, so it's exciting.

835
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:49,010
[SPEAKER_19]: And our old chatters, too.

836
01:01:49,151 --> 01:01:50,411
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and Xbox Live's up now.

837
01:01:50,552 --> 01:01:51,492
[SPEAKER_21]: What are the odds of that one?

838
01:01:52,873 --> 01:01:53,994
[SPEAKER_21]: It's everywhere now.

839
01:01:56,076 --> 01:01:57,577
[SPEAKER_21]: We're not just... We're fucking big.

840
01:01:57,617 --> 01:01:58,157
[SPEAKER_19]: It's sad.

841
01:01:58,797 --> 01:02:00,359
[SPEAKER_19]: Anything else you want to share about your week and your day?

842
01:02:01,164 --> 01:02:03,086
[SPEAKER_21]: I managed to make it here today.

843
01:02:03,406 --> 01:02:04,867
[SPEAKER_21]: Congratulations, that is an accomplishment.

844
01:02:04,947 --> 01:02:08,670
[SPEAKER_21]: Honestly, throughout this Christmas season, I have no idea how many days I'm going to be here.

845
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:12,212
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I work in the mall.

846
01:02:12,532 --> 01:02:12,893
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean...

847
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:14,530
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

848
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:15,911
[SPEAKER_21]: It's alright, you know.

849
01:02:16,811 --> 01:02:20,733
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, the thing is that I'm trying to get coming back here every week.

850
01:02:21,173 --> 01:02:25,115
[SPEAKER_21]: Now that I have a car and stuff, kind of, that walks really fast but doesn't run.

851
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:32,659
[SPEAKER_21]: Once I get this work schedule figured out, there'll be some nights hopefully I'll get here.

852
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:35,380
[SPEAKER_21]: Either that or I'll just come here late, if anything.

853
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:37,361
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, the mall closes at 6, right?

854
01:02:37,381 --> 01:02:39,182
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, the mall closes at 7.

855
01:02:39,262 --> 01:02:40,263
[SPEAKER_21]: Extended hours now.

856
01:02:40,403 --> 01:02:40,703
[SPEAKER_21]: Dope!

857
01:02:41,323 --> 01:02:45,785
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, so I mean, there's some people closing way late for no apparent reason.

858
01:02:46,585 --> 01:02:47,085
[SPEAKER_21]: So we'll see.

859
01:02:47,365 --> 01:02:49,666
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm still going to try to get here, and if not, I'll just get here late.

860
01:02:50,146 --> 01:02:51,567
[SPEAKER_21]: I've got to at least show up at some point.

861
01:02:52,807 --> 01:02:53,887
[SPEAKER_19]: They can't work you too hard.

862
01:02:53,927 --> 01:02:54,768
[SPEAKER_19]: There are labor laws.

863
01:02:56,608 --> 01:03:00,330
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, but there's ways to get around labor laws.

864
01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:01,450
[SPEAKER_21]: It's very easy.

865
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:03,951
[SPEAKER_21]: Anybody can lie these days.

866
01:03:04,851 --> 01:03:05,912
[SPEAKER_01]: You know who his boss is.

867
01:03:05,952 --> 01:03:07,092
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I know who his boss is.

868
01:03:10,169 --> 01:03:14,952
[SPEAKER_19]: And you think his boss would be sympathetic to the situation that there's this Orange Lounge radio program.

869
01:03:15,252 --> 01:03:18,894
[SPEAKER_19]: But no, that just makes him want to make him work more on Sunday nights.

870
01:03:19,414 --> 01:03:19,755
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway.

871
01:03:22,476 --> 01:03:22,716
[SPEAKER_19]: What?

872
01:03:22,756 --> 01:03:23,297
[SPEAKER_22]: You heard what?

873
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:25,178
[SPEAKER_22]: What'd you hear?

874
01:03:25,938 --> 01:03:28,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard that TDX is going to be at Sunsplash.

875
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:37,485
[SPEAKER_19]: Eh, that's a rumor that always comes up, but we don't... I think they want to get it, but maybe the people that actually buy the games don't.

876
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:38,819
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh man.

877
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:39,400
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

878
01:03:40,121 --> 01:03:41,602
[SPEAKER_19]: They were going to get Derby Owner's Club.

879
01:03:42,223 --> 01:03:46,346
[SPEAKER_19]: That's before they found out it was going to be $60,000 for a four-player cabinet.

880
01:03:46,767 --> 01:03:50,570
[SPEAKER_19]: And they said, fuck it, because it's been out for a while and it's not making the money it used to.

881
01:03:51,331 --> 01:03:54,174
[SPEAKER_19]: And it would take over a year to make the money back on it.

882
01:03:54,774 --> 01:03:55,515
[SPEAKER_19]: So they said, fuck it.

883
01:03:55,555 --> 01:03:59,438
[SPEAKER_19]: But they do have $120,000 to spend on arcade games for this coming year.

884
01:04:00,737 --> 01:04:02,538
[SPEAKER_19]: So, it's a possibility.

885
01:04:03,338 --> 01:04:11,620
[SPEAKER_19]: I honestly don't want it there, because I think it'll get fucked up the same way that, you know, the one that Scandia does.

886
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:22,924
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'd rather them, like, upgrade their Complete Mix 2 to a Beat Me in the Final, or even, like, I don't know if it's possible, upgrade Machine 2 to a Beat Me in the Final, or something like that.

887
01:04:23,644 --> 01:04:30,948
[SPEAKER_19]: But I'd rather them do that because at least it gets some play out of it and clean up the machine a bit and replace the coin door on it and stuff.

888
01:04:36,271 --> 01:04:36,611
[SPEAKER_19]: What else?

889
01:04:36,851 --> 01:04:41,573
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, they were... Well, they're supposed to get another DDR machine there.

890
01:04:43,414 --> 01:04:43,895
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't say.

891
01:04:44,675 --> 01:04:48,477
[SPEAKER_19]: But there's possibly a new DDR machine coming in there.

892
01:04:48,637 --> 01:04:49,397
[SPEAKER_19]: It's touring.

893
01:04:49,457 --> 01:04:50,458
[SPEAKER_19]: It's from another golf land.

894
01:04:52,352 --> 01:05:00,714
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, one, uh, speaking of arcades, let's bring up hell and talk about Scandia.

895
01:05:01,855 --> 01:05:04,915
[SPEAKER_21]: Scandia, you thought Scandia was ghetto before.

896
01:05:05,656 --> 01:05:09,116
[SPEAKER_21]: You look at the Xtreme machine, it has no top.

897
01:05:10,357 --> 01:05:13,838
[SPEAKER_21]: It's, uh, they totally ripped the whole thing off the top.

898
01:05:14,258 --> 01:05:16,558
[SPEAKER_21]: There's no speakers, there's no marquee, there's no lights.

899
01:05:17,059 --> 01:05:18,559
[SPEAKER_21]: There's, for Xtreme,

900
01:05:19,781 --> 01:05:21,162
[SPEAKER_21]: No, it gets even better.

901
01:05:21,903 --> 01:05:25,225
[SPEAKER_21]: They left the bass speakers on there because you can't really get rid of them.

902
01:05:26,687 --> 01:05:39,437
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like they went to Kmart and bought a $150 little mini stereo system because there's two really shitty speakers on top, like the detachable ones off of a boombox or something.

903
01:05:39,937 --> 01:05:42,600
[SPEAKER_21]: They're sitting up there, like, you can't hear it, of course.

904
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:47,704
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, who... It wouldn't even matter.

905
01:05:49,123 --> 01:05:50,064
[SPEAKER_21]: They don't care anymore.

906
01:05:50,704 --> 01:05:53,085
[SPEAKER_21]: I've actually heard them say they don't care anymore.

907
01:05:53,905 --> 01:06:00,428
[SPEAKER_21]: That was the, you know, the shift managers were saying that, and also the main guy there doesn't care.

908
01:06:00,588 --> 01:06:06,350
[SPEAKER_20]: They care more about that stupid fucking Hick shooter game than they care about anything else.

909
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:09,572
[SPEAKER_20]: Because people have been blowing money in their left and right.

910
01:06:09,752 --> 01:06:13,053
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what we need to be teaching the people in the ghetto, to shoot white people.

911
01:06:16,596 --> 01:06:20,099
[SPEAKER_19]: I would love to take the camera over to Scandia and get a picture of that assy machine, though.

912
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:23,022
[SPEAKER_19]: It's there, but hey, their 2DX machine works.

913
01:06:23,983 --> 01:06:24,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

914
01:06:24,103 --> 01:06:24,824
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's a miracle.

915
01:06:25,685 --> 01:06:27,306
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got some Scandia tokens I need to blow.

916
01:06:27,326 --> 01:06:29,388
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, I think I want to actually call the owners.

917
01:06:32,931 --> 01:06:34,713
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I, you know... Have a ball.

918
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:37,296
[SPEAKER_02]: I have all the stuff to hook a recorder up to my telephone.

919
01:06:37,316 --> 01:06:38,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Record the conversation and put it on air.

920
01:06:38,457 --> 01:06:38,897
[SPEAKER_19]: It'll be funny.

921
01:06:39,197 --> 01:06:39,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do it.

922
01:06:41,676 --> 01:06:45,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Not if you said that you're recording at the beginning of the phone call.

923
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:49,144
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why every time you call a customer service place, they say this call may be recorded.

924
01:06:50,064 --> 01:06:52,407
[SPEAKER_19]: Say you want to interview them for a local radio station.

925
01:06:54,309 --> 01:06:54,629
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll do it.

926
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:58,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Why does your arcade suck so bad?

927
01:06:59,174 --> 01:07:00,275
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, nobody cares.

928
01:07:00,295 --> 01:07:00,835
[SPEAKER_20]: They're losing money.

929
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:03,378
[SPEAKER_20]: They asked me that again.

930
01:07:04,022 --> 01:07:10,785
[SPEAKER_21]: The other day, the Shift Magic guy comes up, and this is the guy who's like, oh man, you should apply here because it seems like you really care about the games.

931
01:07:10,805 --> 01:07:11,465
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm like, no, thank you.

932
01:07:12,085 --> 01:07:15,627
[SPEAKER_21]: But he's like, why are all your friends not coming here anymore?

933
01:07:15,687 --> 01:07:17,548
[SPEAKER_21]: I said, look at your DDR machine.

934
01:07:18,108 --> 01:07:18,708
[SPEAKER_21]: He said, what?

935
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:22,210
[SPEAKER_21]: He said, it looks like my computer on top of some speakers.

936
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:23,890
[SPEAKER_21]: There's nothing on there.

937
01:07:24,330 --> 01:07:26,912
[SPEAKER_21]: He said, yeah, well, that's because the speakers didn't work.

938
01:07:26,972 --> 01:07:29,713
[SPEAKER_21]: I said, if the speakers didn't work, you don't have to take the whole top off.

939
01:07:30,493 --> 01:07:33,076
[SPEAKER_21]: and he's like, yo, there's some other legal issues coming up.

940
01:07:33,136 --> 01:07:33,837
[SPEAKER_21]: How about this?

941
01:07:34,118 --> 01:07:35,700
[SPEAKER_19]: Keith went to RVGL.

942
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:37,422
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, no, it's not that.

943
01:07:37,482 --> 01:07:44,530
[SPEAKER_20]: They said legal issues came up, so I wonder if someone, you know, ragged on him about having their extreme or something like that.

944
01:07:45,615 --> 01:08:10,173
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh please, that would be the first case I've ever heard of anywhere where somebody said something like that Well for the fact that they said legal issues makes me wonder what it was They're retarded, they don't know what the hell they're talking about Some stupid baby fell off the machine and now they have a lawsuit My kid was climbing the machine, fell down and cracked his head open So you need to remove that so he doesn't climb Darwinism at work

945
01:08:13,533 --> 01:08:17,717
[SPEAKER_08]: The music coming from that machine is making my child gay.

946
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:22,181
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to remove that machine.

947
01:08:22,282 --> 01:08:23,643
[SPEAKER_08]: It's making people gay.

948
01:08:25,485 --> 01:08:28,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do we have to listen to all this Jap music?

949
01:08:28,508 --> 01:08:31,531
[SPEAKER_08]: We live in the United States of America, not Japan.

950
01:08:32,272 --> 01:08:34,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep your music to your own country.

951
01:08:34,374 --> 01:08:34,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

952
01:08:36,451 --> 01:08:58,827
[SPEAKER_21]: No, one funny thing last night, too, I was standing there playing 2DX, and I was playing Dancer, and I didn't have the effects on, because it sounds like absolute shit with the effector on, and this lady's all, that's too loud, they can't hear the music game, and I was like, oh, I'm sorry about that, when she wasn't looking, I hit the effector, which was on Surround 1, so it was just this loud, blaring, screeching noise the whole way through it, she started, like, crying about it, it was pretty funny.

953
01:09:05,396 --> 01:09:12,580
[SPEAKER_19]: Miko's just kind of sitting in the corner, and sometimes, like, she's kind of like, she'll just sit there, and then she'll point at something in the chat, and she'll go, I know her!

954
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:13,301
[SPEAKER_19]: I know her!

955
01:09:13,741 --> 01:09:14,141
I know her!

956
01:09:14,862 --> 01:09:15,202
I know him!

957
01:09:15,642 --> 01:09:15,942
I know him!

958
01:09:16,923 --> 01:09:20,065
[SPEAKER_21]: And then you try to give her the microphone so she can say hi to them, and she does nothing.

959
01:09:20,145 --> 01:09:21,026
[SPEAKER_21]: Immediately clams up.

960
01:09:23,007 --> 01:09:26,729
[SPEAKER_02]: For the record, I love the artichoke dip from the Hufflepuff bar.

961
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:29,491
[SPEAKER_19]: Hufflepuff bar.

962
01:09:29,511 --> 01:09:30,351
[SPEAKER_19]: Hufflepuff bar.

963
01:09:32,190 --> 01:09:35,072
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, let's take a break because we've gone like an hour now without a break.

964
01:09:35,973 --> 01:09:36,954
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think we need to take a break.

965
01:09:36,974 --> 01:09:40,316
[SPEAKER_19]: When we come back, we're going to have... I want to do a cage match first.

966
01:09:40,356 --> 01:09:41,157
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to do a cage match first?

967
01:09:41,357 --> 01:09:41,577
[SPEAKER_19]: Fine.

968
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:42,798
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll do a cage match first.

969
01:09:43,098 --> 01:09:43,999
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll do FUs later.

970
01:09:45,019 --> 01:09:51,704
[SPEAKER_19]: Cage match when we come back from this break with more just cornucopia of Bimani music.

971
01:09:51,804 --> 01:09:52,245
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll be back.

972
01:10:16,269 --> 01:10:17,030
Thanks for watching!

973
01:15:14,312 --> 01:15:23,685
[SPEAKER_12]: And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

974
01:15:24,225 --> 01:15:28,451
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.

975
01:15:28,491 --> 01:15:29,452
[SPEAKER_19]: Can we talk about that?

976
01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:31,816
[SPEAKER_14]: No subject will ever be taboo.

977
01:15:32,316 --> 01:15:35,959
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights.

978
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:39,002
[SPEAKER_19]: Except, of course, the subject that was just under discussion.

979
01:15:39,522 --> 01:15:44,866
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

980
01:15:45,407 --> 01:15:46,748
[SPEAKER_03]: I collect your fucking head.

981
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:50,171
[SPEAKER_14]: Just like this fucker here.

982
01:15:51,252 --> 01:15:54,935
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?

983
01:15:55,215 --> 01:15:58,578
[SPEAKER_22]: The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

984
01:15:59,519 --> 01:16:01,180
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, if any of you sons of bitches...

985
01:16:02,034 --> 01:16:03,835
[SPEAKER_14]: Got anything else to say?

986
01:16:04,175 --> 01:16:05,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Now's the fucking time!

987
01:16:07,117 --> 01:16:10,920
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

988
01:16:12,261 --> 01:16:16,824
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 70.

989
01:16:17,965 --> 01:16:18,665
[SPEAKER_19]: In progress.

990
01:16:20,947 --> 01:16:21,807
[SPEAKER_19]: How's everybody doing?

991
01:16:23,248 --> 01:16:27,131
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm getting pissy because I can't find the cage match pick I want for tonight on my computer.

992
01:16:27,151 --> 01:16:27,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

993
01:16:30,538 --> 01:16:31,539
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been on the whole time.

994
01:16:31,559 --> 01:16:32,980
[SPEAKER_19]: No, it's okay because it's muted.

995
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:36,502
[SPEAKER_19]: Dude, I can mute them here and then they don't go past my computer.

996
01:16:39,183 --> 01:16:39,723
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, what's up?

997
01:16:40,004 --> 01:16:40,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Rob.

998
01:16:40,644 --> 01:16:40,944
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi.

999
01:16:41,224 --> 01:16:41,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob.

1000
01:16:42,145 --> 01:16:42,405
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob.

1001
01:16:42,905 --> 01:16:43,125
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1002
01:16:43,226 --> 01:16:43,446
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob.

1003
01:16:43,566 --> 01:16:43,766
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1004
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:44,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob.

1005
01:16:44,366 --> 01:16:44,646
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1006
01:16:44,907 --> 01:16:45,847
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob.

1007
01:16:45,927 --> 01:16:46,167
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1008
01:16:46,327 --> 01:16:46,568
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob.

1009
01:16:46,608 --> 01:16:46,828
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1010
01:16:47,448 --> 01:16:47,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob.

1011
01:16:47,788 --> 01:16:48,068
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1012
01:16:51,150 --> 01:16:51,671
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate you.

1013
01:16:52,771 --> 01:16:53,352
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Rob.

1014
01:16:53,372 --> 01:16:53,492
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1015
01:17:02,063 --> 01:17:06,227
[SPEAKER_19]: So did you hear about last week's cage match?

1016
01:17:07,007 --> 01:17:07,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, yeah.

1017
01:17:07,948 --> 01:17:09,329
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, because I didn't have a song for you.

1018
01:17:09,369 --> 01:17:10,710
[SPEAKER_19]: We did a reverse cage match.

1019
01:17:11,171 --> 01:17:15,054
[SPEAKER_19]: And we nominated four songs to be booted off the station forever.

1020
01:17:15,434 --> 01:17:19,477
[SPEAKER_19]: And did you know that Loki chose as one of his songs to be banned from the station forever?

1021
01:17:19,878 --> 01:17:20,598
[SPEAKER_19]: He picked Holic.

1022
01:17:21,379 --> 01:17:21,879
[SPEAKER_19]: Bitch.

1023
01:17:24,381 --> 01:17:26,663
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I would so overrule that.

1024
01:17:26,883 --> 01:17:27,184
[SPEAKER_22]: I know.

1025
01:17:27,264 --> 01:17:29,686
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd use my chickly veto power.

1026
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:31,112
[SPEAKER_22]: Your tits.

1027
01:17:33,934 --> 01:17:34,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the other ferret?

1028
01:17:35,595 --> 01:17:44,900
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, yes, last week in the Orange Lounge Radio cage match, we had a reverse cage match, and Nancy and the Boys Complicated from Speed 10 was banned forever.

1029
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:46,601
[SPEAKER_22]: Are you okay with that?

1030
01:17:47,321 --> 01:17:47,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1031
01:17:48,021 --> 01:17:49,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, making sure.

1032
01:17:49,622 --> 01:17:50,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Would I have a problem with that?

1033
01:17:50,943 --> 01:17:51,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

1034
01:17:51,463 --> 01:17:54,285
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, so Nancy and the Boys Complicated, gone forever.

1035
01:17:56,226 --> 01:18:09,009
[SPEAKER_22]: So now we're back to our normal cage match, so we have to flash back to episode number 68, where Loki had a brand new remix that debuted, and it won.

1036
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:18,412
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is the way the cage match works, we're going to play three songs for you guys, so you guys head on over to our chat room, www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on Chat.

1037
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:25,604
[SPEAKER_19]: and you can vote for your favorite and your favorite by your votes determines the winner which goes into rotation all week long on Orange Blouse Radio.

1038
01:18:26,024 --> 01:18:27,545
[SPEAKER_02]: A message for S Ghost?

1039
01:18:28,366 --> 01:18:28,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1040
01:18:28,566 --> 01:18:32,048
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, go to a strip club or hire a hooker.

1041
01:18:33,569 --> 01:18:34,229
[SPEAKER_19]: What was that for?

1042
01:18:36,451 --> 01:18:36,771
[SPEAKER_19]: Whatever.

1043
01:18:37,111 --> 01:18:37,491
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I see.

1044
01:18:38,452 --> 01:18:41,654
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so let's hear the first song you can vote for tonight.

1045
01:18:43,195 --> 01:18:45,837
[SPEAKER_19]: I would say last week's winner, but it's actually two weeks ago's winner.

1046
01:18:47,318 --> 01:18:52,146
[SPEAKER_19]: Battle Without an Honor or Humanity, the 88 Severed Limbs mix by the one and only Loki.

1047
01:18:53,088 --> 01:18:53,549
[SPEAKER_19]: Enjoy!

1048
01:18:54,030 --> 01:18:57,596
[SPEAKER_19]: You only get to hear a clip of it because it did win last week, so we'll start about halfway in.

1049
01:20:25,908 --> 01:20:32,756
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, that's the first song you can vote for tonight is Battle Without a Honor or Humanity, the 88 Severed Limbs mix.

1050
01:20:33,817 --> 01:20:39,544
[SPEAKER_19]: And, um, so, um, you can vote for that one.

1051
01:20:40,164 --> 01:20:42,767
[SPEAKER_19]: Or you can vote for this next one, which is Jamie's pick.

1052
01:20:43,488 --> 01:20:44,850
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, Stop Fighting About Par Par.

1053
01:20:46,419 --> 01:20:48,301
[SPEAKER_08]: We're trying to do a show here, hello!

1054
01:20:48,821 --> 01:20:50,462
[SPEAKER_22]: Jamie, what song did you pick for tonight's K-Dress?

1055
01:20:50,502 --> 01:20:52,263
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought something by Utah Saints.

1056
01:20:52,283 --> 01:20:53,944
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, it's FIFA 2001, actually.

1057
01:20:54,865 --> 01:20:58,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was done for FIFA 2001, but it's something else and I couldn't find the title again.

1058
01:20:58,587 --> 01:20:59,508
[SPEAKER_19]: So we'll just call it FIFA 2001.

1059
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:00,048
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1060
01:21:00,628 --> 01:21:02,930
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, so this is Jamie's pick for tonight's K-Dress.

1061
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:05,852
[SPEAKER_02]: They say the title in the song, though, somewhere.

1062
01:21:06,452 --> 01:21:06,732
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1063
01:21:07,493 --> 01:21:09,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Something Hyper Beat or something.

1064
01:21:09,890 --> 01:21:12,133
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, well any particular reason you're picking this song?

1065
01:21:12,333 --> 01:21:15,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I like Utah Saints, and we've never had one, so I picked one.

1066
01:21:15,818 --> 01:21:20,024
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, here it is, second song you can vote for tonight, Jamie's pick, Utah Saints with FIFA 2001.

1067
01:21:20,064 --> 01:21:20,164
[SPEAKER_22]: Enjoy!

1068
01:23:42,822 --> 01:23:43,483
Check it out!

1069
01:23:43,503 --> 01:23:43,683
Power!

1070
01:23:43,803 --> 01:23:44,023
Power!

1071
01:23:44,043 --> 01:23:44,904
Power to the people!

1072
01:23:44,924 --> 01:23:46,326
Power to the people and the beast!

1073
01:24:50,436 --> 01:24:54,818
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, that was Utah Saints with, what was the real name of that song, Loki?

1074
01:24:54,858 --> 01:24:55,699
[SPEAKER_19]: Power to the Beats.

1075
01:24:55,919 --> 01:24:57,740
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, thank you, DarkSakura, Power to the Beats.

1076
01:24:57,940 --> 01:25:01,642
[SPEAKER_19]: We were calling it FIFA 2001, because it was from the FIFA 2001 game.

1077
01:25:01,662 --> 01:25:05,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not from the game, it was like, for reference.

1078
01:25:07,165 --> 01:25:09,266
[SPEAKER_19]: It was in the game, too.

1079
01:25:09,886 --> 01:25:11,467
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so your thoughts, Jamie?

1080
01:25:12,708 --> 01:25:14,268
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Utah Saints, it gets a 9.

1081
01:25:15,169 --> 01:25:15,389
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki!

1082
01:25:19,167 --> 01:25:25,108
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually really did enjoy that song, and I wish I would have heard it before now.

1083
01:25:25,128 --> 01:25:27,308
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I think it was definitely a good song.

1084
01:25:27,348 --> 01:25:28,969
[SPEAKER_19]: I would give it an 8 or 9.

1085
01:25:49,915 --> 01:25:53,077
[SPEAKER_22]: I would ask Miko what she thinks because she's on the phone, so she loses.

1086
01:25:53,617 --> 01:25:55,938
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, so their song number two you can vote for tonight.

1087
01:25:57,019 --> 01:26:00,520
[SPEAKER_22]: Utah Saints with Power to the... People?

1088
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:00,961
[SPEAKER_22]: Beats.

1089
01:26:01,121 --> 01:26:01,701
[SPEAKER_22]: Power to Beats.

1090
01:26:01,941 --> 01:26:04,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Power to People!

1091
01:26:05,583 --> 01:26:05,903
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

1092
01:26:07,644 --> 01:26:11,786
[SPEAKER_19]: The song I wanted to pick for tonight's cage match I couldn't find and that kind of pisses me off.

1093
01:26:13,404 --> 01:26:14,746
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, it's okay.

1094
01:26:14,906 --> 01:26:17,808
[SPEAKER_19]: I have this backup because I was going to do this song at some point eventually anyway.

1095
01:26:18,349 --> 01:26:19,970
[SPEAKER_19]: I just didn't want to do it tonight, but I'll do it tonight.

1096
01:26:20,711 --> 01:26:22,092
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, what did you think of that song, Mika?

1097
01:26:22,112 --> 01:26:22,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, catch.

1098
01:26:24,113 --> 01:26:24,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Come in!

1099
01:26:27,376 --> 01:26:27,877
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello.

1100
01:26:27,897 --> 01:26:29,838
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey, Jonas, what's up?

1101
01:26:29,858 --> 01:26:31,560
[SPEAKER_23]: Mika, what did you think of that song?

1102
01:26:37,642 --> 01:26:38,723
[SPEAKER_22]: You thought it was, is it on?

1103
01:26:38,803 --> 01:26:40,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, hi, oh, sorry What did you think of the song?

1104
01:26:40,824 --> 01:26:46,467
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was cool I think, I wasn't really listening And what did you think of it on a scale of 1 to 10?

1105
01:26:51,009 --> 01:27:02,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Lower, lower, lower I don't know, can we listen to it again?

1106
01:27:02,715 --> 01:27:03,776
[SPEAKER_22]: No, we can't listen to it again

1107
01:27:07,609 --> 01:27:09,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, I've heard better.

1108
01:27:09,851 --> 01:27:11,051
[SPEAKER_22]: It gets a duh, alright.

1109
01:27:11,652 --> 01:27:12,953
[SPEAKER_07]: I give it a three.

1110
01:27:13,713 --> 01:27:14,313
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a three.

1111
01:27:14,534 --> 01:27:15,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, three and a half.

1112
01:27:17,455 --> 01:27:19,477
[SPEAKER_22]: She says it's good and then gives it a three.

1113
01:27:23,559 --> 01:27:24,300
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay!

1114
01:27:24,580 --> 01:27:27,282
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that vote doesn't count because she wasn't paying attention.

1115
01:27:27,303 --> 01:27:28,644
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, none of our votes count.

1116
01:27:28,684 --> 01:27:31,086
[SPEAKER_19]: It's up to the chatroom in the end, so fair enough.

1117
01:27:31,286 --> 01:27:32,387
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe it's for the best that way.

1118
01:27:33,548 --> 01:27:39,033
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, my pick for tonight is from a new dance compilation out there.

1119
01:27:39,333 --> 01:27:41,896
[SPEAKER_19]: It's Now Dance 2004 from Britain.

1120
01:27:42,516 --> 01:27:46,640
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is Mel C, one of the Spice Girls, but that's okay.

1121
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:47,841
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the Spice Girl that can sing.

1122
01:27:48,141 --> 01:27:48,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Baby Spice?

1123
01:27:48,882 --> 01:27:49,503
[SPEAKER_19]: Sporty Spice.

1124
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:52,452
[SPEAKER_08]: The one with the bad teeth?

1125
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:26,764
[SPEAKER_10]: On a mission, yeah, yeah, yeah If you're with me, raise your hands, yeah, yeah, yeah Got no inhibitions, it's our decision We're gonna have a good time It's easier to let go Than giving to yourself tonight

1126

Yeah, yeah, yeah, if you're with me raise your hand Yeah, yeah, yeah, got no inhibitions

1127
01:31:59,032 --> 01:32:01,734
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, that was Mel C with Yeah Yeah Yeah.

1128
01:32:03,035 --> 01:32:03,395
[SPEAKER_22]: Jamie.

1129
01:32:03,735 --> 01:32:04,055
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1130
01:32:04,716 --> 01:32:06,497
[SPEAKER_22]: Mel C, Yeah Yeah Yeah.

1131
01:32:07,437 --> 01:32:13,741
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of repetitive and made me think of that Britney Spears song that's in Fifth Mix.

1132
01:32:14,522 --> 01:32:17,523
[SPEAKER_02]: So, no offense, but it gets like a 6.8.

1133
01:32:18,664 --> 01:32:19,645
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, Loki.

1134
01:32:24,027 --> 01:32:26,109
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, this just goes to show you...

1135
01:32:27,333 --> 01:32:31,014
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, they can leave the Spice Girls, but they still suck.

1136
01:32:32,334 --> 01:32:35,315
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't care if I turn to you, this is crap.

1137
01:32:36,296 --> 01:32:37,896
[SPEAKER_19]: It gets a 3, because it's good.

1138
01:32:41,837 --> 01:32:42,597
[SPEAKER_22]: It gets a 10.

1139
01:32:43,418 --> 01:32:45,258
[SPEAKER_22]: Loki doesn't know what he's talking about, and LC's awesome.

1140
01:32:46,518 --> 01:32:46,878
[SPEAKER_21]: Zero.

1141
01:32:47,699 --> 01:32:49,259
[SPEAKER_21]: You chose this song, didn't you, Rob?

1142
01:32:49,279 --> 01:32:49,759
[SPEAKER_21]: Of course.

1143
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:52,820
[SPEAKER_21]: That explains all of it.

1144
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:55,461
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, the song really, really sucks.

1145
01:32:56,564 --> 01:33:00,905
[SPEAKER_21]: Probably the worst song I've ever heard next to... Peanut Butter Jelly Time?

1146
01:33:02,785 --> 01:33:07,246
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I've got a whole arsenal of MP3s I can dig out for you, Zero.

1147
01:33:07,826 --> 01:33:08,466
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't care.

1148
01:33:08,706 --> 01:33:11,307
[SPEAKER_19]: It still sucks and it gets less than a zero.

1149
01:33:12,807 --> 01:33:13,587
[SPEAKER_21]: It gets less than me.

1150
01:33:14,088 --> 01:33:15,648
[SPEAKER_21]: No, that sucked.

1151
01:33:15,748 --> 01:33:16,628
[SPEAKER_21]: I never want to hear it again.

1152
01:33:16,748 --> 01:33:17,648
[SPEAKER_21]: It gets like a one.

1153
01:33:19,209 --> 01:33:19,529
[SPEAKER_21]: That's it.

1154
01:33:20,329 --> 01:33:21,489
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, Miko?

1155
01:33:23,870 --> 01:33:24,370
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good.

1156
01:33:24,530 --> 01:33:25,650
[SPEAKER_07]: I give it a one.

1157
01:33:28,151 --> 01:33:31,374
[SPEAKER_19]: Battle Without a Honor or Humanity 88 Severed Limb Mix

1166
01:34:38,462 --> 01:34:41,323
[SPEAKER_19]: I wanted to talk, because I know you wanted to talk about this earlier.

1167
01:34:42,043 --> 01:34:43,284
[SPEAKER_19]: You picked up a new game this week.

1168
01:34:43,304 --> 01:34:48,766
[SPEAKER_19]: You passed up Ultramix to get your Eurobee collection, but you did get a new game this week, right?

1169
01:34:48,786 --> 01:34:50,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy X-2, not X. Final Fantasy X-2.

1170
01:34:52,188 --> 01:34:54,829
[SPEAKER_02]: People, it's 10, not X. Run the numerals.

1171
01:34:55,209 --> 01:34:55,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Say it with me.

1172
01:34:56,389 --> 01:34:58,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Ten, two.

1173
01:34:59,329 --> 01:34:59,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody?

1174
01:35:00,290 --> 01:35:00,630
[SPEAKER_19]: X2?

1175
01:35:01,230 --> 01:35:00,630
12?

1176
01:35:01,790 --> 01:35:02,650
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it Final Fantasy 12?

1177
01:35:02,970 --> 01:35:05,051
[SPEAKER_19]: To piss Jamie off, I'll be calling it X2 all night long.

1178
01:35:05,331 --> 01:35:05,371
[SPEAKER_19]: X2.

1179
01:35:05,411 --> 01:35:06,551
[SPEAKER_19]: So what did you think of X2?

1180
01:35:07,731 --> 01:35:08,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1181
01:35:08,111 --> 01:35:09,071
[SPEAKER_02]: That game doesn't exist.

1182
01:35:09,412 --> 01:35:10,592
[SPEAKER_22]: What did you think of Final Fantasy 12?

1183
01:35:12,212 --> 01:35:16,153
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the posters for that game look pretty neat, and the main character's hot.

1184
01:35:17,239 --> 01:35:19,500
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, yes, they do have pictures of the game up on the internet now.

1185
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:23,582
[SPEAKER_19]: So what do you think about Final Fantasy, I mean, Charlie's Angels, the game?

1186
01:35:29,225 --> 01:35:30,646
[SPEAKER_18]: That was just like... That was great.

1187
01:35:31,942 --> 01:35:54,831
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the game, I'm having a great time with it, although my big disappointment came when they brought in my man, because in the Japanese version my favorite voice actor is his voice, the guy with one leg, and his voice is okay in the US one, but I'm getting a Japanese one coming up probably in a month or so, so I get to hear it later.

1188
01:35:57,879 --> 01:35:58,460
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not bad.

1189
01:35:58,540 --> 01:36:04,525
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole Albed thing is back, you know, where you pick up the primer and everything, but it doesn't really interfere with the game.

1190
01:36:05,827 --> 01:36:06,807
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty neat so far.

1191
01:36:07,308 --> 01:36:09,630
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm about, I think, up on the fourth, fifth mission.

1192
01:36:10,471 --> 01:36:11,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm enjoying it.

1193
01:36:13,013 --> 01:36:22,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, make sure that you have plenty of healing implements and as much magic refill things as you can right at the beginning of the game because it gets pretty tough.

1194
01:36:23,999 --> 01:36:26,640
[SPEAKER_02]: But the whole Dressphere thing is pretty neat.

1195
01:36:27,180 --> 01:36:33,983
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll probably pick it up and play through it because I played through 10 and I played through all the other ones and it's what I do.

1196
01:36:37,124 --> 01:36:37,705
[SPEAKER_19]: But yeah.

1197
01:36:40,766 --> 01:36:43,367
[SPEAKER_19]: Ah, Darkchild says that at E3 they called it X2.

1198
01:36:43,427 --> 01:36:45,188
[SPEAKER_02]: They're idiots.

1199
01:36:47,749 --> 01:36:48,269
[SPEAKER_21]: Just saying.

1200
01:36:53,025 --> 01:36:56,167
[SPEAKER_21]: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, X is not actually how it is.

1201
01:36:56,548 --> 01:36:57,048
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1202
01:36:57,188 --> 01:36:58,129
[SPEAKER_19]: This isn't Mega Man.

1203
01:36:58,169 --> 01:37:00,430
[SPEAKER_19]: They're just tailgating off the X-Men.

1204
01:37:01,091 --> 01:37:01,531
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

1205
01:37:01,631 --> 01:37:05,634
[SPEAKER_19]: You see, because I really... I would find that person and shoot them in the head.

1206
01:37:06,054 --> 01:37:06,535
[SPEAKER_19]: X this.

1207
01:37:06,755 --> 01:37:09,957
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I really liked Final Fantasy VIII.

1208
01:37:10,357 --> 01:37:11,318
[SPEAKER_19]: It was really cool.

1209
01:37:11,578 --> 01:37:13,860
[SPEAKER_19]: But this one's okay too, I guess.

1210
01:37:15,801 --> 01:37:17,222
[SPEAKER_22]: I think everybody should get over it.

1211
01:37:17,262 --> 01:37:18,022
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a game name.

1212
01:37:18,543 --> 01:37:25,368
[SPEAKER_02]: But thanks to a link provided by... Who did I get that from?

1213
01:37:25,408 --> 01:37:26,409
[SPEAKER_02]: From Nikari earlier.

1214
01:37:27,770 --> 01:37:30,432
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got an MP3 of the English opening.

1215
01:37:30,632 --> 01:37:33,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and I have to... We're going to need to skip forward just a little bit in the MP3.

1216
01:37:34,014 --> 01:37:36,015
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I'm going to have to unpack it first.

1217
01:37:36,055 --> 01:37:37,556
[SPEAKER_19]: But we'll get to that after everybody's review.

1218
01:37:37,576 --> 01:37:39,978
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll get to it after everybody's review because I have to unpack it first.

1219
01:37:40,318 --> 01:37:40,878
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1220
01:37:41,338 --> 01:37:43,980
[SPEAKER_02]: They had another version of the intro.

1221
01:37:44,020 --> 01:37:45,941
[SPEAKER_02]: They translated the intro.

1222
01:37:46,141 --> 01:37:50,624
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that they were going to do, oh my God, they had the worst singer ever.

1223
01:37:51,364 --> 01:37:53,385
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounded worse than the Best of Move 2 music.

1224
01:37:54,906 --> 01:37:55,667
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, no.

1225
01:37:57,651 --> 01:38:04,320
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they actually had an English speaking person doing the intro, the last person, and it really sucked.

1226
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:12,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Kota Kumi was actually pretty good, her English one, but she put very odd pauses in it, and so it wouldn't have worked out.

1227
01:38:14,672 --> 01:38:17,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Too many people would have just been really stupid over it and not liked it.

1228
01:38:18,576 --> 01:38:20,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though her voice is absolutely awesome.

1229
01:38:20,698 --> 01:38:22,459
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like her voice better than the one they got.

1230
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:28,124
[SPEAKER_02]: But the final person they settled with though has a really nice voice and did the song justice, I thought.

1231
01:38:29,385 --> 01:38:34,670
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's still, you know, the same intro for everyone who's seen the Japanese intro.

1232
01:38:36,552 --> 01:38:36,692
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1233
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:45,531
[SPEAKER_02]: and probably pre-show next week I'm going to have the song Real Emotion on our pre-show.

1234
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:55,503
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, yeah, so I got to see a little bit of X-2 yesterday, and it's interesting.

1235
01:38:55,683 --> 01:39:03,206
[SPEAKER_19]: I really liked how there's... I mean, this is to be expected when you have a direct sequel to a Final Fantasy game, but a lot of the same areas.

1236
01:39:03,246 --> 01:39:06,027
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, you know, I was watching the beginning of the game, and there's a lot of Luka in it.

1237
01:39:06,347 --> 01:39:11,189
[SPEAKER_19]: And so it was kind of cool to see the same areas, but with these new characters and different things.

1238
01:39:11,209 --> 01:39:12,509
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know, I'm easily amused, I guess.

1239
01:39:13,650 --> 01:39:16,651
[SPEAKER_19]: But the gameplay overall, it looks like they kept the same...

1240
01:39:17,618 --> 01:39:21,667
[SPEAKER_19]: engine for everything outside the battles and then totally redid the battle engine.

1241
01:39:22,327 --> 01:39:23,727
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all active battle.

1242
01:39:23,927 --> 01:39:24,828
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's all active battle now.

1243
01:39:24,848 --> 01:39:25,868
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to be really fast.

1244
01:39:25,908 --> 01:39:26,708
[SPEAKER_19]: And they have the dress fears.

1245
01:39:26,788 --> 01:39:30,329
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's the first thing I noticed was, my God, the battles are fast-paced.

1246
01:39:30,549 --> 01:39:30,949
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow.

1247
01:39:31,269 --> 01:39:32,009
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's pretty cool.

1248
01:39:32,069 --> 01:39:32,489
[SPEAKER_19]: I like that.

1249
01:39:32,509 --> 01:39:35,470
[SPEAKER_19]: I like the idea of some fast-paced battles in a Final Fantasy game.

1250
01:39:36,150 --> 01:39:37,010
[SPEAKER_19]: The dress fears are fun.

1251
01:39:37,050 --> 01:39:51,053
[SPEAKER_19]: But this is, yeah, between the dress fears and the whole just blatant Charlie's Angels theme going on with it, it is seriously, it's a cross between Final Fantasy and a Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen shopping game.

1252
01:39:51,073 --> 01:39:51,213
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow.

1253
01:39:52,053 --> 01:39:52,533
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

1254
01:39:53,613 --> 01:39:54,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not insult the game like that.

1255
01:39:55,014 --> 01:40:00,735
[SPEAKER_19]: And then, you know, you go to these tells, you're talking to people, it's like, you totally scored like 1,500 kills.

1256
01:40:00,755 --> 01:40:04,056
[SPEAKER_19]: You open a chest that says, you scored Phoenix Down.

1257
01:40:04,696 --> 01:40:04,996
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.

1258
01:40:05,356 --> 01:40:08,216
[SPEAKER_19]: And everything is awesome this, awesome that.

1259
01:40:08,957 --> 01:40:10,737
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh my god, you were so awesome.

1260
01:40:10,937 --> 01:40:12,377
[SPEAKER_19]: You're going up a level, babe.

1261
01:40:13,057 --> 01:40:15,958
[SPEAKER_02]: That particular scene where they're talking about the awesome sphere.

1262
01:40:16,338 --> 01:40:17,958
[SPEAKER_18]: Girl, you know how to work that level.

1263
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:20,459
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like that in the Japanese version.

1264
01:40:22,192 --> 01:40:24,133
[SPEAKER_18]: You're so fired!

1265
01:40:27,315 --> 01:40:28,936
[SPEAKER_02]: I did notice some changes.

1266
01:40:29,877 --> 01:40:35,320
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Japanese version, there's the seagull team, and there's the gull wings in the US one.

1267
01:40:35,380 --> 01:40:37,221
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like little changes here and there.

1268
01:40:39,482 --> 01:40:40,883
[SPEAKER_02]: But they got all the same voice actors.

1269
01:40:41,943 --> 01:40:42,783
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that was pretty cool.

1270
01:40:42,843 --> 01:40:47,926
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't get me wrong, just because I say it's a cross between a Mary Kay and Ashley Olsen game, I'm just, I'm poking fun at it.

1271
01:40:48,326 --> 01:40:49,946
[SPEAKER_19]: It really does look like a pretty neat game.

1272
01:40:49,986 --> 01:40:54,869
[SPEAKER_19]: I wish I could have, like, played it a little more, but I'm too consumed with Eleven to give a shit about any other Final Fantasy right now.

1273
01:40:55,509 --> 01:40:56,649
[SPEAKER_19]: Um... Addict.

1274
01:40:57,170 --> 01:40:59,270
[SPEAKER_19]: So... Ragnarok is cooler.

1275
01:40:59,410 --> 01:41:00,191
[SPEAKER_19]: Ragnarok is cooler.

1276
01:41:00,211 --> 01:41:04,313
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, and I need to beat Ten first anyway, so... Um...

1277
01:41:06,092 --> 01:41:09,017
[SPEAKER_19]: Final Fantasy X-2, not too shabby.

1278
01:41:10,079 --> 01:41:11,481
[SPEAKER_19]: It's kind of what you'd expect.

1279
01:41:11,581 --> 01:41:17,852
[SPEAKER_19]: It's definitely kind of made for the fanboys, although, I don't know, I would say it's very J-game.

1280
01:41:21,874 --> 01:41:24,196
[SPEAKER_19]: It's more for like teenage girls and gay men, but that's okay.

1281
01:41:25,036 --> 01:41:28,218
[SPEAKER_19]: Fanboys will love it too because, you know, I guess they're hot or whatever.

1282
01:41:28,238 --> 01:41:29,439
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely gives the fan service.

1283
01:41:29,639 --> 01:41:31,380
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's definitely for the fans.

1284
01:41:31,821 --> 01:41:36,584
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's good because they need to sell a lot of copies to make up for how much money they lost on the movie.

1285
01:41:37,144 --> 01:41:42,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I really, though, I really think that the different job changed just a little.

1286
01:41:42,548 --> 01:41:48,091
[SPEAKER_02]: They have like set animations, like when you change into the singer role.

1287
01:41:50,523 --> 01:41:55,448
[SPEAKER_02]: She has the spotlight on her and the lights behind her and it's dark, so it looks all dramatic.

1288
01:41:55,488 --> 01:41:58,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you change into the thief, she hops across the moon.

1289
01:41:59,632 --> 01:42:01,914
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's a moon in the background and they hop across.

1290
01:42:02,295 --> 01:42:08,601
[SPEAKER_02]: When you change into the sword fighter, you see their reflection in the sword.

1291
01:42:08,961 --> 01:42:11,844
[SPEAKER_02]: And Yuna has Titus' sword.

1292
01:42:12,704 --> 01:42:13,385
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really cool.

1293
01:42:13,425 --> 01:42:14,006
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that's pretty neat.

1294
01:42:15,144 --> 01:42:16,205
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty cool.

1295
01:42:16,706 --> 01:42:18,607
[SPEAKER_19]: It actually doesn't look like it ruins a whole lot.

1296
01:42:18,647 --> 01:42:22,590
[SPEAKER_19]: I still haven't beaten Final Fantasy X and it hasn't really ruined a whole lot, really.

1297
01:42:22,630 --> 01:42:31,597
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, you can kind of pick up something that must happen, but I'm kind of appreciative that they didn't wreck the whole storyline to X with X-2, you know what I mean?

1298
01:42:33,558 --> 01:42:34,359
[SPEAKER_19]: Does that make sense at all?

1299
01:42:34,779 --> 01:42:35,299
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sense.

1300
01:42:35,559 --> 01:42:35,860
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

1301
01:42:38,842 --> 01:42:39,582
[SPEAKER_19]: What did you think, Loki?

1302
01:42:39,602 --> 01:42:40,823
[SPEAKER_19]: You got to see the game a little bit.

1303
01:42:41,484 --> 01:42:42,164
[SPEAKER_19]: He's running away.

1304
01:42:42,545 --> 01:42:44,106
[SPEAKER_19]: Have you gotten to play X-2 at all, Zero?

1305
01:42:46,081 --> 01:42:47,082
[SPEAKER_19]: What did you think of what you saw?

1306
01:42:47,742 --> 01:42:50,685
[SPEAKER_21]: A little bit, and what I saw, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it or not.

1307
01:42:51,185 --> 01:42:59,251
[SPEAKER_21]: It just looked kind of girly to me, but I mean, I saw a couple battle scenes, I thought they looked really good, so I'm definitely going to be at some point picking it up.

1308
01:43:00,232 --> 01:43:05,296
[SPEAKER_21]: The strategy guide is really cool, especially with the limited edition one, with all the artwork and stuff in it.

1309
01:43:06,377 --> 01:43:25,941
[SPEAKER_21]: Going by reading some of that strategy guide and seeing some of the stuff I saw and from what other people have been telling me, I think that I actually will like it, because I really didn't like X too much, because it just, I don't know, I just didn't really get with the story, but it looks like this one, with its more fast-paced action, I think I'll be able to keep up with it a lot more and enjoy it.

1310
01:43:28,533 --> 01:43:37,099
[SPEAKER_02]: It really does feel like you're coming in at the end of 10 because it's like what you can do is already advanced as far as where you can go.

1311
01:43:37,739 --> 01:43:40,021
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get choices of different missions you can take.

1312
01:43:40,761 --> 01:43:41,201
[SPEAKER_02]: It's neat.

1313
01:43:41,842 --> 01:43:42,442
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoy the game.

1314
01:43:45,644 --> 01:43:48,186
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, you guys want to know tonight's cage match winner?

1315
01:43:49,427 --> 01:43:52,229
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, let's unveil tonight's cage match winner.

1316
01:43:56,299 --> 01:43:57,039
[SPEAKER_19]: Back to the cage match.

1317
01:43:57,099 --> 01:44:03,222
[SPEAKER_19]: I've tallied up all the votes and we have a tie in tonight's cage match.

1318
01:44:03,522 --> 01:44:04,002
[SPEAKER_21]: Yay.

1319
01:44:04,722 --> 01:44:22,990
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a tie in tonight's cage match between Loki's pick, Battle Without a Honor or Humanity, the 88 Severed Lindenix, and between the Utah Saints song,

1320
01:44:26,148 --> 01:44:26,828
[SPEAKER_22]: Oops, that's not it.

1321
01:44:28,809 --> 01:44:29,389
[SPEAKER_22]: It's this one.

1322
01:44:29,449 --> 01:44:29,769
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry.

1323
01:44:30,890 --> 01:44:31,370
[SPEAKER_22]: There it is.

1324
01:44:33,991 --> 01:44:34,551
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the one.

1325
01:44:34,571 --> 01:44:35,251
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry about that.

1326
01:44:35,571 --> 01:44:35,951
[SPEAKER_19]: My bad.

1327
01:44:38,052 --> 01:44:38,932
[SPEAKER_19]: So we have a tie.

1328
01:44:40,173 --> 01:44:42,733
[SPEAKER_19]: And in that case, I get to break the tie.

1329
01:44:44,374 --> 01:44:45,014
[SPEAKER_19]: With a hammer?

1330
01:44:45,394 --> 01:44:46,975
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, you can't send in house votes.

1331
01:44:47,055 --> 01:44:47,635
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm on to you.

1332
01:44:49,196 --> 01:44:50,696
[SPEAKER_19]: So I get to break the tie vote.

1333
01:44:51,636 --> 01:44:52,877
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, well, this is tricky.

1334
01:44:55,382 --> 01:44:57,004
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, whereas, what?

1335
01:44:57,745 --> 01:45:02,231
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a tie between the first and second songs tonight, and I get to break the tie.

1336
01:45:02,751 --> 01:45:13,364
[SPEAKER_19]: And whereas, I think I do prefer Battle Without a Honor or Humanity, I didn't quite care for what Loki had to say about my cage match pick, so I'm choosing Jamie's cage match pick tonight.

1337
01:45:13,384 --> 01:45:13,805
[SPEAKER_19]: Yay!

1338
01:45:15,859 --> 01:45:18,341
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh no, now I have to make another song, oh no.

1339
01:45:18,501 --> 01:45:26,105
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but, but, I would like to vote that I vote that that goes into permanent rotation.

1340
01:45:28,807 --> 01:45:30,528
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, okay.

1341
01:45:32,449 --> 01:45:33,010
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure, why not?

1342
01:45:33,450 --> 01:45:34,991
[SPEAKER_19]: Since we're all Kill Bill fans anyway.

1343
01:45:38,713 --> 01:45:41,355
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, so there we go.

1344
01:45:41,455 --> 01:45:44,257
[SPEAKER_19]: So you'll hear both of those songs in Orange House Rotation pretty soon.

1345
01:45:46,138 --> 01:45:49,719
[SPEAKER_19]: And yes, there were votes for the Mel C song, so don't go thinking.

1346
01:45:49,739 --> 01:45:51,839
[SPEAKER_02]: By people who have no musical taste.

1347
01:45:51,999 --> 01:45:54,000
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't like where you're going with that statement, buddy.

1348
01:45:54,020 --> 01:45:56,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I gave you a 6 on that song.

1349
01:45:57,420 --> 01:45:57,820
[SPEAKER_02]: 6.8 even.

1350
01:46:01,981 --> 01:46:03,901
[SPEAKER_02]: If she wasn't singing, it would have gotten a 9.

1351
01:46:05,782 --> 01:46:06,142
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1352
01:46:06,502 --> 01:46:09,803
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to take a quick break.

1353
01:46:09,883 --> 01:46:11,523
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to play that real emotion.

1354
01:46:13,305 --> 01:46:16,766
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to play that Real Emotion from Final Fantasy X-2 and something else in this break.

1355
01:46:17,566 --> 01:46:19,687
[SPEAKER_19]: Then when we come back, we'll do the FUs of the week.

1356
01:46:20,207 --> 01:46:21,807
[SPEAKER_19]: We have to skip forward, though, a little bit.

1357
01:46:21,847 --> 01:46:23,768
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll probably play both versions.

1358
01:46:25,588 --> 01:46:27,089
[SPEAKER_19]: We have the Japanese shortened up one?

1359
01:46:28,149 --> 01:46:30,229
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so we'll play both versions then, I guess.

1360
01:46:31,250 --> 01:46:35,891
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to skip forward a little bit in this MP3, so pardon us while we navigate this MP3 a little bit to find you the actual words.

1361
01:46:36,211 --> 01:46:39,392
[SPEAKER_19]: So we'll hear both the English and Japanese versions of Real Emotion.

1362
01:46:40,801 --> 01:46:44,054
[SPEAKER_19]: and we'll be back with the FUs of the week so send those in over private message to Sky.

1363
01:47:12,706 --> 01:47:13,067
RUN!

1364
01:48:01,008 --> 01:48:01,149
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey.

1365
01:48:01,209 --> 01:48:01,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey.

1366
01:49:45,561 --> 01:49:46,534
[SPEAKER_14]: What can I do for you?

1367
01:52:12,342 --> 01:52:16,504
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

1368
01:52:16,765 --> 01:52:18,445
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you one of these staffers by Hollywood?

1369
01:52:18,465 --> 01:52:21,147
[SPEAKER_14]: No!

1370
01:52:21,247 --> 01:52:22,588
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we care what people think of us?

1371
01:52:23,228 --> 01:52:25,089
[SPEAKER_14]: No!

1372
01:52:25,169 --> 01:52:26,510
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

1373
01:52:26,990 --> 01:52:29,892
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes!

1374
01:52:31,072 --> 01:52:35,875
[SPEAKER_12]: Extreme Bomani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

1375
01:52:37,591 --> 01:52:46,253
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi everybody, we're back, and both versions of a real motion back-to-back there, and there's a third one out there too, Koda doing the English, but we don't have that currently.

1376
01:52:47,373 --> 01:52:48,794
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll just have to play that later!

1377
01:52:49,334 --> 01:52:49,514
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep.

1378
01:52:50,434 --> 01:52:57,436
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, it's about time to get into the FUs of the week, but Jamie's not here just yet, so Loki, is there anything going on out there in the sim world you want to tell us about?

1379
01:52:58,596 --> 01:52:58,696
[SPEAKER_19]: Um...

1380
01:53:00,939 --> 01:53:13,512
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess, um, people are working on, um, skins for, you know, the rest of the Bomani games, like, you know, Extreme and stuff, uh, here, Poppin' Music's in development for Step Mania, support for that, and, um,

1381
01:53:16,548 --> 01:53:23,495
[SPEAKER_19]: Key Sound BMS files for NinthStyle will be up on MyStyle later this week.

1382
01:53:38,211 --> 01:53:43,996
[SPEAKER_19]: Also on SuperNova.org, they've got the hard drive images for some of the rest of the Beatmania games.

1383
01:53:44,496 --> 01:53:45,777
[SPEAKER_19]: Almost all of them are covered now.

1384
01:53:46,298 --> 01:53:49,480
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you have the latest version of MAME, you can play those as well.

1385
01:53:50,241 --> 01:53:54,985
[SPEAKER_19]: So go get those if you want to play the actual arcade game of Beatmania.

1386
01:53:56,426 --> 01:54:02,411
[SPEAKER_19]: And yeah, there's other stuff, but I can't mention the other stuff too.

1387
01:54:02,951 --> 01:54:04,413
[SPEAKER_19]: But that's more local anyways.

1388
01:54:04,773 --> 01:54:06,935
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's it.

1389
01:54:08,044 --> 01:54:11,686
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, and I'm sure people are going to be ripping Xbox stuff, but nothing yet.

1390
01:54:12,366 --> 01:54:21,430
[SPEAKER_19]: And as I mentioned last week, DDR Fever stuff is available on DDRAmerica.org or whatever it is, I can't remember.

1391
01:54:22,170 --> 01:54:27,793
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a DDR BitTorrent site, and you can download the craptastic songs that they have on there.

1392
01:54:29,274 --> 01:54:29,774
[SPEAKER_23]: That's about it.

1393
01:54:32,981 --> 01:54:43,910
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, well, let's see, I think we're about ready to get into the FUs of the week, so you want to send those over to me, Sky, private message?

1394
01:54:48,639 --> 01:54:51,081
[SPEAKER_19]: and try to limit yourselves on the FUs of the week.

1395
01:54:51,121 --> 01:54:54,484
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm getting several people who are writing me novels this week and forget it.

1396
01:54:54,844 --> 01:54:58,406
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm capping you guys after like three or four FUs because it's too much.

1397
01:54:59,027 --> 01:55:02,570
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's a lot of people sending them tonight, so send me your best ones.

1398
01:55:03,550 --> 01:55:07,033
[SPEAKER_19]: In the meantime, Jamie, what is the FU segment all about?

1399
01:55:07,413 --> 01:55:09,675
[SPEAKER_02]: When we're pissed off and tell everyone about it.

1400
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:31,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my first FU of the week goes to people who are consistently negative and have nothing positive to say.

1401
01:55:32,603 --> 01:55:39,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Like someone who, um, never mind, I'm not naming names, but someone who is listening right now.

1402
01:55:40,567 --> 01:55:42,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm not mentioning names, they know who they are.

1403
01:55:44,403 --> 01:55:50,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me, who always says, oh, this sucks, oh, that's not my style, or I don't like this.

1404
01:55:50,767 --> 01:55:52,728
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always negative, always negative.

1405
01:55:52,988 --> 01:55:58,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, another one goes toward having to go back to work.

1406
01:55:58,851 --> 01:56:02,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, honestly, when I went back to work, we were having a Thanksgiving potluck.

1407
01:56:02,633 --> 01:56:03,153
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty cool.

1408
01:56:05,363 --> 01:56:14,069
[SPEAKER_02]: and of course it's also no longer our busy season of the year so we're really slow so I've got tons of time just to get stuff done and think.

1409
01:56:16,830 --> 01:56:22,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Effie goes to my cat for meeting a bath so I have to go wash my cat.

1410
01:56:22,834 --> 01:56:31,560
[SPEAKER_18]: I always need to make sure that the pussy's clean.

1411
01:56:34,312 --> 01:56:35,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at least she's well petted.

1412
01:56:35,513 --> 01:56:37,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1413
01:56:40,075 --> 01:56:49,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Another FU goes toward the upstairs room at my house for not being clean, so I have to clean that.

1414
01:56:49,661 --> 01:56:50,561
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to do that.

1415
01:56:53,123 --> 01:56:57,105
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all the stupid people in California, which are most everybody.

1416
01:56:57,825 --> 01:56:58,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody.

1417
01:56:59,186 --> 01:57:00,147
[SPEAKER_02]: There's smart people in this.

1418
01:57:00,227 --> 01:57:02,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody in this room I can say is an intelligent human being.

1419
01:57:03,467 --> 01:57:06,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Most everybody else though sucks and none of them can drive.

1420
01:57:08,929 --> 01:57:09,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Stupid people.

1421
01:57:10,489 --> 01:57:16,211
[SPEAKER_02]: And another one goes toward me for leaving my aura gel at home because my tooth hurts.

1422
01:57:17,411 --> 01:57:21,393
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, I think that's about it.

1423
01:57:21,513 --> 01:57:23,373
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really not full of angst today.

1424
01:57:24,214 --> 01:57:24,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, 10-2.

1425
01:57:24,634 --> 01:57:24,614
10.

1426
01:57:24,654 --> 01:57:25,674
[SPEAKER_02]: 10.

1427
01:57:24,894 --> 01:57:25,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Not angst.

1428
01:57:25,874 --> 01:57:26,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1429
01:57:33,409 --> 01:57:42,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, and another one goes towards Square for closing the Final Fantasy XI beta right before I could install my beta copy.

1430
01:57:43,194 --> 01:57:43,815
[SPEAKER_19]: Square Enix.

1431
01:57:44,135 --> 01:57:44,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Squeenix.

1432
01:57:45,616 --> 01:57:46,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Squeenix.

1433
01:57:46,917 --> 01:57:47,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Big F you to Squeenix.

1434
01:57:49,278 --> 01:57:52,720
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a F you toward me not having more money.

1435
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:53,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm done.

1436
01:57:55,242 --> 01:57:55,582
[SPEAKER_19]: Matt.

1437
01:57:58,824 --> 01:57:58,924
[SPEAKER_19]: Um...

1438
01:57:59,926 --> 01:58:01,627
[SPEAKER_19]: The first one, well, it's kind of minor.

1439
01:58:01,907 --> 01:58:09,092
[SPEAKER_19]: The first one was FU to Final Fantasy XI because I was wandering into a tomb where I didn't know I was going and I got jumped by two goblins.

1440
01:58:09,392 --> 01:58:15,516
[SPEAKER_19]: See, now, if this were real life, I would kick the goblin's ass without thinking about it, but this is a game, so I can't do that.

1441
01:58:15,536 --> 01:58:16,857
[SPEAKER_02]: You're playing an MMORPG.

1442
01:58:16,957 --> 01:58:18,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha ha ha ha.

1443
01:58:18,078 --> 01:58:19,419
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I'm playing Final Fantasy.

1444
01:58:19,599 --> 01:58:20,700
[SPEAKER_19]: I play Final Fantasy.

1445
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:22,781
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't play online games.

1446
01:58:22,841 --> 01:58:25,103
[SPEAKER_02]: You're playing an on... It's an online game!

1447
01:58:25,646 --> 01:58:27,206
[SPEAKER_19]: It's half of an online game.

1448
01:58:27,366 --> 01:58:28,567
[SPEAKER_19]: It's half Final Fantasy.

1449
01:58:29,107 --> 01:58:31,047
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm only breaking half the rule.

1450
01:58:32,848 --> 01:58:33,768
[SPEAKER_02]: You break half of it.

1451
01:58:33,808 --> 01:58:34,828
[SPEAKER_02]: You break the whole thing.

1452
01:58:35,708 --> 01:58:36,408
[SPEAKER_19]: You don't understand.

1453
01:58:36,528 --> 01:58:38,029
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm playing it leisurely.

1454
01:58:38,289 --> 01:58:39,489
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not like going out there.

1455
01:58:39,569 --> 01:58:43,110
[SPEAKER_19]: I have to be out there all day because I have to level up every day.

1456
01:58:43,370 --> 01:58:43,930
[SPEAKER_19]: Every day.

1457
01:58:43,950 --> 01:58:45,110
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh my god.

1458
01:58:45,270 --> 01:58:50,571
[SPEAKER_19]: If I'm not in this world like most of my life, I don't know what I'm going to do.

1459
01:58:50,852 --> 01:58:52,532
[SPEAKER_02]: I dedicate the Nelson laugh to you.

1460
01:58:55,496 --> 01:58:57,640
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, Second Nephew goes to leaves.

1461
01:58:58,080 --> 01:58:58,982
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't like leaves.

1462
01:58:59,543 --> 01:59:05,492
[SPEAKER_19]: And the fact that every single leaf that's in this apartment complex fell, like, during one day.

1463
01:59:05,933 --> 01:59:08,397
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just like it's snow outside, but it's leaves.

1464
01:59:09,543 --> 01:59:11,726
[SPEAKER_19]: There's just like so many leaves out there.

1465
01:59:11,846 --> 01:59:17,832
[SPEAKER_19]: It's kind of funny because the Mexicans were here the day before, like blowing off the leaves, like the few leaves that were there.

1466
01:59:18,273 --> 01:59:22,958
[SPEAKER_19]: And then like a few days later, just every single leaf falls all at once.

1467
01:59:23,338 --> 01:59:27,523
[SPEAKER_19]: Man, I wish I could see their sad face when they come to work, you know, next week.

1468
01:59:28,163 --> 01:59:28,944
[SPEAKER_19]: But oh man.

1469
01:59:29,625 --> 01:59:31,207
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyways, also...

1470
01:59:32,805 --> 01:59:42,309
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, FU to, uh, stupid power outage that we had today, because that means I had to, you know, get up and do stuff, so that sucked.

1471
01:59:43,189 --> 01:59:47,871
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, and, I don't know, I really don't have much.

1472
01:59:48,192 --> 01:59:55,395
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, FU to people that are, like, doing this, they're talking about Michael Jackson and already, you know, victim him of, you know, molesting this child.

1473
01:59:56,315 --> 02:00:00,357
[SPEAKER_19]: Here's my opinion on it, and you're going to listen to it anyways, because I'm making you.

1474
02:00:00,977 --> 02:00:01,037
[SPEAKER_19]: Um...

1475
02:00:01,880 --> 02:00:08,287
[SPEAKER_19]: Basically, I think he's an easy target and that they're just taking advantage of him because he's an easy target and a freak that sleeps with children.

1476
02:00:08,828 --> 02:00:12,472
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, while he may be a freak that sleeps with children, doesn't mean that he's groping them.

1477
02:00:13,012 --> 02:00:17,637
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, I just think he's just a freak, but I think he's innocent.

1478
02:00:17,757 --> 02:00:21,441
[SPEAKER_19]: And yet people are like, man, I wouldn't let my kid next to that chum, Lester.

1479
02:00:22,302 --> 02:00:23,103
[SPEAKER_19]: He's been convicted.

1480
02:00:23,183 --> 02:00:24,844
[SPEAKER_19]: He hasn't even gone on the trail yet.

1481
02:00:24,944 --> 02:00:26,625
[SPEAKER_19]: You haven't heard any of the details yet.

1482
02:00:27,606 --> 02:00:28,667
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just, it's annoying.

1483
02:00:29,027 --> 02:00:30,528
[SPEAKER_19]: But, I hate the media.

1484
02:00:31,049 --> 02:00:46,861
[SPEAKER_19]: Because now they're talking about this instead of Kobe Bryant, and then, you know, next thing you'll hear is like, I don't know, Bob Barker will have, like, chicken heads stapled to his walls, and, like, some of the models will be missing, and he'll be a cannibal or something, you know, and that'll be that, so...

1485
02:00:47,541 --> 02:00:49,222
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just like, it'll never end.

1486
02:00:49,562 --> 02:00:52,104
[SPEAKER_19]: And thank God we don't have to hear about J-Lo at least.

1487
02:00:52,324 --> 02:00:58,729
[SPEAKER_19]: She's probably pissed off that she's not getting any media coverage about her marriages or... I don't know if I should get married!

1488
02:00:59,349 --> 02:00:59,929
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe?

1489
02:01:00,230 --> 02:01:00,910
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

1490
02:01:01,230 --> 02:01:01,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe?

1491
02:01:02,111 --> 02:01:02,511
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1492
02:01:02,731 --> 02:01:03,992
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just like, it's really annoying.

1493
02:01:04,172 --> 02:01:04,733
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't care.

1494
02:01:05,673 --> 02:01:11,737
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, like, if something like that happened, Bob Barker would have a bunch of kittens and puppies killed all in his house.

1495
02:01:12,198 --> 02:01:13,779
[SPEAKER_20]: And then he's talking about Spanning and Pets.

1496
02:01:16,556 --> 02:01:18,839
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had a horrible thought and Rod's probably going to hate me for this.

1497
02:01:19,640 --> 02:01:25,346
[SPEAKER_02]: He's probably got the preserved corpse of Rod Rod in his closet so that he can open it up.

1498
02:01:25,646 --> 02:01:27,388
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you do in this situation, Rod?

1499
02:01:27,428 --> 02:01:28,049
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you do?

1500
02:01:30,251 --> 02:01:32,414
[SPEAKER_18]: I would sell it on eBay.

1501
02:01:33,495 --> 02:01:35,898
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyways, um, yeah, I'm done.

1502
02:01:37,791 --> 02:02:05,325
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, FU to, um, Iron Chef, for not, like, last night we watched the, they tied, okay, so they go into an overcooked round, and, um, they had, the first round was the potato match, which was awesome, because I love potatoes, so, I was watching that, and then the next round was sweet potatoes, I was like, you know what would be cool, is if they put something in there that, like, no one would want to cook, like kittens, they should have the kitten, you know, Iron Chef cook off, and it would be great, because, you know, they'd just be like,

1503
02:02:06,025 --> 02:02:10,068
[SPEAKER_19]: All grossed out and stuff, but they have to create awesome dishes using kittens.

1504
02:02:10,949 --> 02:02:11,489
[SPEAKER_19]: Live kittens.

1505
02:02:12,410 --> 02:02:13,290
[SPEAKER_18]: So, that's it.

1506
02:02:14,151 --> 02:02:14,451
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1507
02:02:14,471 --> 02:02:16,072
[SPEAKER_02]: I still want to see the live octopus one.

1508
02:02:17,493 --> 02:02:18,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Like from the intro.

1509
02:02:19,515 --> 02:02:20,635
[SPEAKER_18]: Giant alien.

1510
02:02:21,696 --> 02:02:22,156
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, I'm done.

1511
02:02:22,417 --> 02:02:22,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Dog.

1512
02:02:23,317 --> 02:02:23,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Horse meat.

1513
02:02:25,379 --> 02:02:26,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

1514
02:02:26,139 --> 02:02:26,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

1515
02:02:26,399 --> 02:02:27,400
[SPEAKER_22]: Give me a mic.

1516
02:02:27,660 --> 02:02:28,741
[SPEAKER_22]: Try giving me a microphone.

1517
02:02:28,781 --> 02:02:29,862
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd love to give some FUs.

1518
02:02:32,552 --> 02:02:59,313
[SPEAKER_19]: I have a couple FUs this week FU to the power going out earlier today that fucking sucked and I thought I thought you know what though FU for not staying off longer I wish it was still off right now then I would have had an excuse to just stay home and not do a show tonight true I could have just gone over to Jamie's but I would have taken the easy way out you would have left me to do this by myself no I would have taken the easy way out and said no show tonight but the power couldn't stay off longer I would have run away anyway because I love our listeners so do you

1519
02:03:00,370 --> 02:03:01,812
[SPEAKER_22]: They could live without us for one week.

1520
02:03:01,832 --> 02:03:04,816
[SPEAKER_22]: They could go outside and find something to do.

1521
02:03:05,658 --> 02:03:06,198
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's see.

1522
02:03:06,218 --> 02:03:12,347
[SPEAKER_19]: F you to people that hate on the show Survivor because it's cool to hate on reality TV.

1523
02:03:13,048 --> 02:03:15,412
[SPEAKER_19]: Yet this show is still consistently in the top ten for some reason.

1524
02:03:16,012 --> 02:03:39,440
[SPEAKER_19]: and the show rocks and yes this week sucked because the best person on it got voted out but the show itself is still good and next season is going to be like the best television ever so F you to people that hate on reality TV just because it's reality TV because this show rules the only reason it's doing so well is all those two year olds watching the show that and you know the other show anyways that sucked

1525
02:03:39,898 --> 02:03:46,242
[SPEAKER_19]: Fucking A that he got voted off, but, you know, that's alright, because, you know, vicariously through someone else, he will have his revenge.

1526
02:03:46,903 --> 02:03:50,665
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what, I kind of view, a lot of people hate on it, because, like, you know, it's fake or whatever.

1527
02:03:50,745 --> 02:03:52,166
[SPEAKER_19]: I kind of view it as a sport.

1528
02:03:52,646 --> 02:03:54,928
[SPEAKER_19]: For me, Survivor is my wrestling.

1529
02:03:55,168 --> 02:04:02,192
[SPEAKER_19]: You have the drama, you have the competitions, you have it way played out, it's, you know what... But wrestling has hotter guys.

1530
02:04:03,593 --> 02:04:04,634
[SPEAKER_19]: Mmm, I don't know about that.

1531
02:04:05,515 --> 02:04:07,396
[SPEAKER_19]: If you like those muscle guys, meh.

1532
02:04:07,964 --> 02:04:11,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all of them are... Yeah, they can make it on Survivor.

1533
02:04:12,607 --> 02:04:17,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, not all of the guys in wrestling are like Brock Lesnar where their neck muscles are growing out of their ears.

1534
02:04:18,691 --> 02:04:20,572
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like the really hot guys like Billy Kidman.

1535
02:04:20,952 --> 02:04:21,432
[SPEAKER_02]: He's hot.

1536
02:04:23,113 --> 02:04:24,114
[SPEAKER_19]: Wrestling's okay.

1537
02:04:24,214 --> 02:04:25,915
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just, you know, it's not my cup of tea.

1538
02:04:25,955 --> 02:04:29,497
[SPEAKER_19]: But I don't hate on wrestling just because wrestling is popular.

1539
02:04:29,798 --> 02:04:32,339
[SPEAKER_19]: Yet people hate on Survivor because Survivor's popular.

1540
02:04:32,379 --> 02:04:33,120
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm saying F you.

1541
02:04:34,199 --> 02:04:37,443
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't watch wrestling because they don't wrestle against little kittens.

1542
02:04:37,963 --> 02:04:41,186
[SPEAKER_19]: God damn it, I want to see the big people smash the kittens.

1543
02:04:41,847 --> 02:04:43,188
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that so much to ask?

1544
02:04:45,130 --> 02:04:49,195
[SPEAKER_19]: And to be honest, I actually rather enjoy wrestling when Chyna's involved, except she's gone now.

1545
02:04:49,235 --> 02:04:50,876
[SPEAKER_02]: She's trying to be a singer now.

1546
02:04:51,077 --> 02:04:54,120
[SPEAKER_19]: And I like it when they get out the tables and the ladders.

1547
02:04:54,220 --> 02:04:55,101
[SPEAKER_19]: That's always entertaining.

1548
02:04:56,024 --> 02:04:59,106
[SPEAKER_02]: The TLC net, tables, ladders, and chairs.

1549
02:04:59,186 --> 02:04:59,886
[SPEAKER_22]: And cookie sheets.

1550
02:05:01,147 --> 02:05:07,390
[SPEAKER_22]: I also liked how the one icon on Jamie's wrestling data for some game was a little spinning ladder.

1551
02:05:07,810 --> 02:05:09,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, on the new SmackDown game.

1552
02:05:10,011 --> 02:05:10,431
[SPEAKER_02]: That was cool.

1553
02:05:10,571 --> 02:05:11,152
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a ladder.

1554
02:05:11,652 --> 02:05:12,532
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, that rocked.

1555
02:05:12,972 --> 02:05:15,694
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, let's hear from other folks in our room.

1556
02:05:16,734 --> 02:05:17,715
[SPEAKER_19]: Zero, you're up for use of the week.

1557
02:05:19,355 --> 02:05:23,337
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, I can say fuck you to my car, obviously, because it's a piece of shit.

1558
02:05:24,237 --> 02:05:27,719
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, fuck you to about half, no, not half the people.

1559
02:05:28,219 --> 02:05:32,521
[SPEAKER_21]: Everybody in the mall except 14 of them, and those 14 of which I happen to work with.

1560
02:05:33,322 --> 02:05:43,526
[SPEAKER_21]: Everybody else is a big group of assholes who don't know how to park and yell at you because some guy almost makes you crash into them, and yet they're the stupid asses who keep going and driving like they're stupid morons.

1561
02:05:44,507 --> 02:05:44,607
[SPEAKER_21]: Um...

1562
02:05:46,741 --> 02:05:50,962
[SPEAKER_21]: FU to still not having quite enough cash for absolutely anything.

1563
02:05:52,062 --> 02:05:55,683
[SPEAKER_21]: FU to having to go to the dentist because that shit sucks.

1564
02:05:56,744 --> 02:06:00,405
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, FU to Mortal Kombat 5, should have stopped at like 3.

1565
02:06:00,685 --> 02:06:02,665
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a Mortal Kombat 5?

1566
02:06:03,505 --> 02:06:06,266
[SPEAKER_21]: Supposedly, they already have screenshots of it and it looks totally stupid.

1567
02:06:06,286 --> 02:06:08,547
[SPEAKER_19]: But I thought that's what Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance was supposed to be.

1568
02:06:08,567 --> 02:06:09,947
[SPEAKER_19]: Deadly Alliance was Deadly Alliance.

1569
02:06:11,360 --> 02:06:16,322
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought it was just Mortal Kombat 5, but they didn't call it Mortal Kombat 5 because they didn't put it in the arcades.

1570
02:06:16,562 --> 02:06:19,724
[SPEAKER_21]: No, it's just Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance.

1571
02:06:19,744 --> 02:06:23,185
[SPEAKER_19]: But now they're doing Mortal Kombat 5 because they realized, oh, Deadly Alliance is kind of popular.

1572
02:06:23,225 --> 02:06:24,546
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe we should have put it in the arcades.

1573
02:06:24,586 --> 02:06:27,787
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, which is absolutely ridiculous because they should have stopped at the failure of 4.

1574
02:06:30,268 --> 02:06:31,469
[SPEAKER_19]: Deadly Alliance was okay.

1575
02:06:31,509 --> 02:06:33,570
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, it was no Soul Calibur, but it was entertaining.

1576
02:06:33,610 --> 02:06:35,690
[SPEAKER_19]: It was more entertaining than a lot of fighting games I've played.

1577
02:06:37,671 --> 02:06:38,632
[SPEAKER_19]: Fatalities are still cool.

1578
02:06:39,888 --> 02:06:44,871
[SPEAKER_21]: Fatalities all sucked on Deadly Alliance.

1579
02:06:46,392 --> 02:06:52,056
[SPEAKER_21]: They didn't even put friendships or anything in there because those were the funniest out of everything.

1580
02:06:52,796 --> 02:06:56,739
[SPEAKER_21]: Not really much else to say fuck you to because there's just not a whole lot going on.

1581
02:06:57,539 --> 02:07:01,682
[SPEAKER_21]: But yeah, fuck you to people who are telling me I'm lying when I have proof of what I'm talking about.

1582
02:07:02,422 --> 02:07:06,044
[SPEAKER_21]: And really, that seems to be about it.

1583
02:07:06,084 --> 02:07:06,925
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't have a whole big

1584
02:07:11,991 --> 02:07:26,395
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, we have, um, Jonas is here, hello This is Mr. Explosive himself And just realize that the FU music right now is the Butterfly Pikachu mix So you might want to keep it short I'm gonna keep it short, there's not gonna be any FUs though Alright, what's up?

1585
02:07:26,615 --> 02:07:33,617
[SPEAKER_17]: The first FU is Bitches on the Damn Road Fucked up the, um, you know the, you know the song when you go down and it goes up?

1586
02:07:35,037 --> 02:07:36,978
[SPEAKER_17]: Fuckin', um, scratch the bottom of my car

1587
02:07:38,260 --> 02:07:38,720
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, Dips.

1588
02:07:40,622 --> 02:07:42,863
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I'm not sure if I'm gonna get a new bump or not.

1589
02:07:44,544 --> 02:07:45,465
[SPEAKER_17]: Nah, I have speed bumps, though.

1590
02:07:45,525 --> 02:07:50,168
[SPEAKER_17]: Just some... Hell nah, I'm not getting that crazy, but drop 70 miles an hour on speed bumps.

1591
02:07:52,429 --> 02:07:53,350
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyways, anyways.

1592
02:07:54,351 --> 02:07:58,454
[SPEAKER_17]: And the FU2 beat getting my right arm injured, in a way.

1593
02:07:59,654 --> 02:08:01,215
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll show the videos later.

1594
02:08:03,523 --> 02:08:13,409
[SPEAKER_17]: and basically not many FUs except for people emailing me about the upcoming tournament I'm trying to organize for April which I have no place at yet.

1595
02:08:13,789 --> 02:08:15,550
[SPEAKER_17]: People saying, when is it going to be coming over?

1596
02:08:16,311 --> 02:08:17,251
[SPEAKER_17]: It's coming soon.

1597
02:08:17,271 --> 02:08:22,374
[SPEAKER_17]: And people are issuing about bar raping versus no bar raping on PA.

1598
02:08:23,995 --> 02:08:28,878
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's a whole other discussion we could have later.

1599
02:08:29,525 --> 02:08:31,406
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I don't want to doubt you with that.

1600
02:08:31,546 --> 02:08:33,166
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of the boys just read it, dammit.

1601
02:08:35,867 --> 02:08:38,388
[SPEAKER_17]: And they have a few two fanboys all over.

1602
02:08:38,408 --> 02:08:40,929
[SPEAKER_17]: All they talk about is the same old shit over and over and over.

1603
02:08:41,590 --> 02:08:47,072
[SPEAKER_17]: How they say like, Neonix is cool, or Cloud is the best character, she should be in Final Fantasy.

1604
02:08:48,312 --> 02:08:49,333
[SPEAKER_17]: All the Final Fantasys.

1605
02:08:50,053 --> 02:08:50,893
[SPEAKER_17]: Etc, etc.

1606
02:08:51,213 --> 02:08:55,295
[SPEAKER_17]: And especially the new, upcoming movie of Final Fantasy, Children's Advent.

1607
02:08:57,561 --> 02:09:04,503
[SPEAKER_19]: I already know, you know what, as much as I love Final Fantasy 7, I'm already convinced this movie is going to be a huge disappointment, so... That's what I'm thinking.

1608
02:09:04,543 --> 02:09:05,603
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not looking forward to it.

1609
02:09:06,223 --> 02:09:14,285
[SPEAKER_17]: I've already seen, like, The Spirits Within, but all I'm going to do is throw fanboy shit, like, ooh, let's throw in Cloud and Sephiroth, fight together, pow pow pow.

1610
02:09:15,086 --> 02:09:16,186
[SPEAKER_17]: There, that's a movie.

1611
02:09:21,507 --> 02:09:24,308
[SPEAKER_17]: But I'm not going to judge it from its cover, I'll see what happens.

1612
02:09:25,997 --> 02:09:27,278
[SPEAKER_19]: I will judge it by its cover.

1613
02:09:27,838 --> 02:09:28,658
[SPEAKER_19]: Big disappointment.

1614
02:09:30,039 --> 02:09:30,659
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just kidding.

1615
02:09:30,699 --> 02:09:31,599
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll watch it, of course.

1616
02:09:33,520 --> 02:09:35,961
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, that's all I have to say for now.

1617
02:09:35,981 --> 02:09:39,162
[SPEAKER_17]: Miko, do you have any FUs?

1618
02:09:39,762 --> 02:09:41,143
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, Miko, do you have any FUs of the week?

1619
02:09:42,123 --> 02:09:42,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really.

1620
02:09:45,265 --> 02:09:45,685
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay!

1621
02:09:47,325 --> 02:09:49,386
[SPEAKER_19]: Then let's get on to our Charm FUs, shall we?

1622
02:09:51,147 --> 02:09:53,648
[SPEAKER_19]: Jamie, would you like to enter an FU on behalf of Miko?

1623
02:09:55,462 --> 02:09:56,683
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to not having an FU.

1624
02:09:56,703 --> 02:09:57,784
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

1625
02:10:00,366 --> 02:10:00,866
[SPEAKER_19]: Moving on.

1626
02:10:00,886 --> 02:10:03,288
[SPEAKER_02]: What is up with this Mary Kay and Ashley DVD?

1627
02:10:04,388 --> 02:10:04,869
[SPEAKER_22]: Moving on.

1628
02:10:05,549 --> 02:10:13,995
[SPEAKER_19]: Zodiac Knight would like to give an FU of the week to Squeenix for using a sucky version of Real Emotion as the X2 opening song.

1629
02:10:14,295 --> 02:10:15,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that version did not suck.

1630
02:10:17,337 --> 02:10:20,600
[SPEAKER_22]: Darketsuyu would like to say FU to this cold that still hasn't gone away.

1631
02:10:21,673 --> 02:10:50,272
[SPEAKER_22]: Jason would like to say, F you to Cable One, while I'm happy that I have cable, it's really stupid that me and my friend are separated by four houses and one street, and that he can't get cable, hurry the hell up, uh, fuck you boss, name withheld, for calling me fat, I haven't gained a pound in quite a while, Jason would also like to say, fuck myself, for not listening in a while, and not having a reason not to listen, yes, unpermissible, fired, you have a microphone, oh, the other ferret,

1632
02:10:52,219 --> 02:10:53,220
[SPEAKER_19]: Where the hell did it go?

1633
02:10:53,440 --> 02:10:54,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I threw it at you.

1634
02:10:54,461 --> 02:10:56,683
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, then it's your fault for throwing it at me, isn't it?

1635
02:10:57,884 --> 02:10:58,365
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, here it is.

1636
02:10:59,426 --> 02:11:00,226
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't throw it again.

1637
02:11:00,847 --> 02:11:02,509
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, F you, Jason.

1638
02:11:02,689 --> 02:11:03,710
[SPEAKER_19]: Shame on you for not listening.

1639
02:11:08,494 --> 02:11:27,649
[SPEAKER_19]: DJ Dark Knight would like to say F you to the game attendants at my local Putt-Putt for not fixing the 2DX and initial D machines because the 2DX machines still have the black void on the top of the screen and you can't watch the videos and the initial D machine for not fixing the two player side wheel because of that I lost a match racing Friday night

1640
02:11:28,902 --> 02:11:31,726
[SPEAKER_19]: Here's a suggestion, stop playing Initial D Hey!

1641
02:11:31,766 --> 02:11:42,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding Here's a suggestion, get a JPS 2 and play it at home Play Initial D at home like I do Dark Child

1642
02:11:43,888 --> 02:11:48,653
[SPEAKER_19]: DD Arcaholic, I don't know, I think it's Dark Child sending most of these FUs, but they keep switching their name back and forth.

1643
02:11:49,914 --> 02:11:53,979
[SPEAKER_19]: Dark Child likes to say FU to people who call others stupid for saying things differently than they do.

1644
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:58,223
[SPEAKER_22]: FU to people who act one way and bitch at others for doing it themselves.

1645
02:11:58,383 --> 02:12:03,389
[SPEAKER_22]: FU to the cat shit smell creeping in on me, and FU to Pillar Boy of GameStop Arden, whatever that means.

02:12:10,087 --> 02:12:15,269
[SPEAKER_22]: Last week they scheduled me less than 10 hours and this week they scheduled me 30 plus before schedule changes.

1648
02:12:16,930 --> 02:12:18,550
[SPEAKER_19]: My boss and his wife are morons.

1649
02:12:18,610 --> 02:12:21,031
[SPEAKER_19]: They should learn how to schedule before starting a business.

1650
02:12:21,971 --> 02:12:22,892
[SPEAKER_19]: F you to my dreams.

1651
02:12:22,932 --> 02:12:25,893
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sick of being a Secret Service member for a bag of salad.

1652
02:12:27,033 --> 02:12:27,453
[SPEAKER_19]: What?

1653
02:12:28,473 --> 02:12:31,914
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sick of being a Secret Service member for a bag of salad.

1654
02:12:31,934 --> 02:12:33,435
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1655
02:12:34,750 --> 02:12:36,391
[SPEAKER_19]: Oddly enough, I always die at the end.

1656
02:12:36,431 --> 02:12:38,051
[SPEAKER_19]: I think Freud would have a field day with me.

02:12:39,312 --> 02:12:41,193
[SPEAKER_19]: F you to anyone who thinks I'm a pervert now.

1658
02:12:41,253 --> 02:12:45,475
[SPEAKER_19]: I was making a reference to an earlier statement like that tits equal veto power.

1659
02:12:45,555 --> 02:12:48,136
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sexist, and I'm sorry if anyone thought I was.

1660
02:12:48,416 --> 02:12:50,417
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but, but, but they do.

1667
02:13:15,550 --> 02:13:16,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I quit PSO.

1668
02:13:16,531 --> 02:13:16,971
[SPEAKER_19]: Interesting.

1669
02:13:17,191 --> 02:13:18,271
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, you finally quit PSO?

1670
02:13:18,331 --> 02:13:20,372
[SPEAKER_02]: We're canceling PSO to get Final Fantasy XI.

1671
02:13:20,633 --> 02:13:21,233
[SPEAKER_19]: Good choice.

1672

1677
02:13:37,079 --> 02:13:39,281
[SPEAKER_19]: Thieves own all, not surprisingly.

02:13:39,661 --> 02:13:40,961
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm set.

1679
02:13:42,642 --> 02:13:46,665
[SPEAKER_19]: Jazz would like to say, F you to people who accuse me of cheating on Ultramix.

1680
02:13:46,705 --> 02:13:50,587
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not my fault that you can't be as great as an arrow-smashing fairy as I am.

1681
02:13:53,387 --> 02:13:53,568
[SPEAKER_19]: Aw.

1682
02:13:55,269 --> 02:13:58,432
[SPEAKER_19]: From one arrow smashing fairy to another, you show them who's boss.

1683
02:14:00,514 --> 02:14:03,637
[SPEAKER_19]: DJ Spector would like to say F you to my Spanish teacher.

1684
02:14:04,018 --> 02:14:07,341
[SPEAKER_19]: F you to Sam's Club for not having the digital camera they supposedly had.

1685
02:14:08,082 --> 02:14:10,364
[SPEAKER_19]: F you to school and F you to optical illusions.

1686
02:14:10,424 --> 02:14:10,965
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's four.

1687
02:14:12,489 --> 02:14:16,331
[SPEAKER_19]: Minst would like to say, F you to teen night at the DDR place by my house.

1688
02:14:16,471 --> 02:14:19,632
[SPEAKER_19]: Home from college for break, and I forgot they did that on Fridays.

1689
02:14:19,652 --> 02:14:23,634
[SPEAKER_19]: The place was filled with various small children acting even more stupid than usual.

1690
02:14:24,595 --> 02:14:30,337
[SPEAKER_19]: Minst would also like to say, F you to people who angst over initial D. I've seen it for the first time and it's not a pretty sight.

1691
02:14:31,858 --> 02:14:34,519
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh yes, and F you to being on dial-up for 10 days.

1692
02:14:35,019 --> 02:14:40,462
[SPEAKER_19]: And F you to the people in the general area where I live, as for some reason they've decided it's now popular to goth.

1693
02:14:46,413 --> 02:14:48,635
[SPEAKER_19]: Angel would like to say, I can't give you my F.U.

1694
02:14:48,675 --> 02:14:50,916
[SPEAKER_19]: as much as I'd like to, but here we go.

1695
02:14:52,758 --> 02:14:56,060
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, she's trying to omit names and stuff.

1696
02:14:56,740 --> 02:14:56,981
[SPEAKER_19]: F.U.

1697
02:14:57,021 --> 02:15:00,343
[SPEAKER_19]: to friends hanging out with enemies and expecting me to be cool with it.

1698
02:15:00,383 --> 02:15:02,264
[SPEAKER_19]: Stop trying to think that I'm friends with you still.

1699
02:15:02,304 --> 02:15:02,804
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm over it.

1700
02:15:02,844 --> 02:15:03,565
[SPEAKER_19]: Why can't you be?

1701
02:15:03,585 --> 02:15:04,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1702
02:15:06,187 --> 02:15:06,407
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1703
02:15:10,237 --> 02:15:10,838
[SPEAKER_19]: S.A.E.

1704
02:15:11,198 --> 02:15:13,360
[SPEAKER_19]: would like to say, Hey Sky, an F.U.

1705
02:15:13,420 --> 02:15:16,523
[SPEAKER_19]: to Initial D for ruining my confidence to drive in real life.

1706
02:15:17,283 --> 02:15:21,247
[SPEAKER_19]: Here's a hint, stop playing Initial D. Just teasing.

1707
02:15:22,168 --> 02:15:22,868
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkLion.

1708
02:15:24,897 --> 02:15:29,259
[SPEAKER_19]: 16, XVI, whatever he prefers to be called, would like to say F you to sleep deprivation.

1709
02:15:29,339 --> 02:15:32,761
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't get any much sleep last Wednesday for some reason.

1710
02:15:33,161 --> 02:15:34,622
[SPEAKER_19]: I slept at around 4 a.m.

1711
02:15:34,662 --> 02:15:36,683
[SPEAKER_19]: and forced myself to wake up around 6 a.m.

1712
02:15:36,723 --> 02:15:37,863
[SPEAKER_19]: to take my cousin to school.

1713
02:15:38,844 --> 02:15:41,565
[SPEAKER_19]: F you to name changing in some of the games and anime in general.

1714
02:15:41,746 --> 02:15:43,386
[SPEAKER_19]: I know there are some good name changes.

1715
02:15:43,486 --> 02:15:45,608
[SPEAKER_19]: Today should at least be a good reason for it.

1716
02:15:46,388 --> 02:15:51,551
[SPEAKER_19]: Lastly, F you to the tourists who visit the Adventure Dome, who break the Maman machines and act like idiots.

1717
02:15:54,140 --> 02:15:55,401
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, that's it.

1718
02:15:57,342 --> 02:15:58,603
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, Mika thought of an FU.

1719
02:15:59,123 --> 02:16:00,104
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, well, wait a minute.

1720
02:16:01,244 --> 02:16:01,784
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, go for it.

1721
02:16:03,445 --> 02:16:06,587
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have to say FU to the people who don't wear seatbelts.

1722
02:16:09,454 --> 02:16:38,082
[SPEAKER_07]: because Haley something from my school just passed away because she did not wear a seatbelt and she was driving in the pouring rain and speeding without a seatbelt so she lost out of control and she crashed into some other cars and she's dead well that's Darwinism for you

1723
02:16:39,195 --> 02:16:39,496
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

1724
02:16:40,036 --> 02:16:40,277
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry.

1725
02:16:41,338 --> 02:16:43,482
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, hard lesson learned, unfortunately.

1726
02:16:43,522 --> 02:16:44,043
[SPEAKER_19]: It's too bad.

1727
02:16:45,064 --> 02:16:45,305
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow.

1728
02:16:46,987 --> 02:16:48,029
[SPEAKER_19]: At least she wasn't drunk.

1729
02:16:48,650 --> 02:16:50,873
[SPEAKER_19]: At least she wasn't drunk and driving.

1730
02:16:50,893 --> 02:16:52,576
[SPEAKER_19]: Because that's even worse, if you ask me.

1731
02:16:55,802 --> 02:16:57,483
[SPEAKER_19]: You throw like a girl, Jonas.

1732
02:16:57,603 --> 02:17:02,746
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just kidding.

1733
02:17:05,347 --> 02:17:05,827
[SPEAKER_22]: Ah, blow me.

1734
02:17:06,207 --> 02:17:06,568
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

1735
02:17:07,508 --> 02:17:07,728
[SPEAKER_22]: Wow.

1736
02:17:07,748 --> 02:17:13,991
[SPEAKER_22]: I wish it was that easy.

1737
02:17:14,292 --> 02:17:16,833
[SPEAKER_22]: I wish I could just walk up to some cute guy.

1738
02:17:16,893 --> 02:17:17,473
[SPEAKER_22]: Ah, blow me.

1739
02:17:17,793 --> 02:17:18,093
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1740
02:17:19,694 --> 02:17:20,155
[SPEAKER_22]: God.

1741
02:17:20,535 --> 02:17:21,735
[SPEAKER_22]: I wish it was that easy.

1742
02:17:21,775 --> 02:17:23,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Depends on where you go, when you go.

1743
02:17:23,396 --> 02:17:24,437
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, yes.

1744
02:17:25,302 --> 02:17:25,802
[SPEAKER_22]: You had a thought?

1745
02:17:30,544 --> 02:17:31,285
[SPEAKER_02]: There was my thought.

1746
02:17:31,385 --> 02:17:31,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's another one.

1747
02:17:34,666 --> 02:17:35,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Rob.

1748
02:17:35,726 --> 02:17:35,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob.

1749
02:17:36,007 --> 02:17:36,247
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1750
02:17:36,807 --> 02:17:37,387
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1751
02:17:37,427 --> 02:17:37,667
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1752
02:17:38,148 --> 02:17:38,408
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1753
02:17:38,968 --> 02:17:39,308
[SPEAKER_19]: What?

1754
02:17:39,868 --> 02:17:40,168
[SPEAKER_19]: What?

1755
02:17:42,830 --> 02:17:43,210
[SPEAKER_19]: I hate you.

1756
02:17:43,930 --> 02:17:46,391
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1757
02:17:46,451 --> 02:17:47,051
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see.

1758
02:17:47,271 --> 02:17:49,913
[SPEAKER_19]: We are going to take a little breaky break here.

1759
02:17:51,833 --> 02:17:52,894
[SPEAKER_19]: And when we come back...

1760
02:17:54,850 --> 02:17:57,492
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to play some more Ultramix, I think.

1761
02:17:58,292 --> 02:18:00,153
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're also going to do some Ask Orange Lounge.

1762
02:18:01,014 --> 02:18:01,994
[SPEAKER_19]: How's that sound, kids?

1763
02:18:02,334 --> 02:18:02,915
[SPEAKER_19]: Sound like fun?

1764
02:18:04,175 --> 02:18:05,076
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I thought so.

1765
02:18:05,896 --> 02:18:07,457
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, so we'll take a break.

1766
02:18:08,578 --> 02:18:10,699
[SPEAKER_19]: And we'll be right back.

1767
02:18:11,980 --> 02:18:15,562
[SPEAKER_19]: You can send those questions for Ask Orange Lounge now to me, Sky, in the chat room.

1768
02:18:21,926 --> 02:18:27,323
[SPEAKER_13]: A little better you and me A little better such a friend

1769
02:19:28,753 --> 02:19:29,554
Thanks for watching!

1770
02:19:56,626 --> 02:19:58,130
[SPEAKER_13]: A little bit of agency

1771
02:22:18,446 --> 02:22:19,632
Thanks for watching!

1772
02:22:49,625 --> 02:22:50,275
Thanks for watching!

1773
02:23:34,076 --> 02:23:38,842
[SPEAKER_11]: From the Step Squad to Orange Labs, this DDR sucks!

1774
02:23:38,963 --> 02:23:43,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler!

1775
02:23:43,228 --> 02:23:43,669
[SPEAKER_11]: TTPO!

1776
02:23:48,356 --> 02:23:52,860
[SPEAKER_19]: Hello and welcome back everybody to Orange Launch Radio, episode 70, our season 4 premiere.

1777
02:23:53,480 --> 02:23:55,882
[SPEAKER_19]: A few programming notes, things we need to tell you guys about.

1778
02:23:57,143 --> 02:23:59,045
[SPEAKER_19]: Vanilla Sky is going to be moving.

1779
02:23:59,465 --> 02:24:02,207
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not going to be on Monday nights anymore, it's going to be on Wednesday nights.

1780
02:24:02,607 --> 02:24:08,712
[SPEAKER_19]: Those of you that were listening to the show this week know that LankyStyle got a brand new job, which he started tonight, best of luck to him.

1781
02:24:09,373 --> 02:24:12,475
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's going to require that he's not available Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday nights.

1782
02:24:12,996 --> 02:24:16,619
[SPEAKER_19]: So instead, we're going to move the show to Wednesday so he can still be a part of it.

1783
02:24:17,339 --> 02:24:45,661
[SPEAKER_19]: and because they've been really good on that show and we've talked about a lot of interesting game things and non-game things so if you haven't tuned into that you should also back live this week on Tuesday is my show pump up the volume the unabbreviated pump up the volume hint hint pre-show at 7 show starts at 7.30 hang out in the chat room if you make a request if I have it I'll play it it's that easy

1784
02:24:47,068 --> 02:24:50,342
[SPEAKER_02]: And make sure that you get 20 people to sign in and listen to me this time.

1785
02:24:50,904 --> 02:24:51,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I'll cry.

1786
02:24:55,433 --> 02:25:02,396
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, some of you may be asking yourselves, well, if Vanilla Sky is moving to Wednesdays, what's happening to LiveWire?

1787
02:25:03,176 --> 02:25:08,238
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I guess Loki would be best to answer that question, but I'll kind of answer it for him.

1788
02:25:08,678 --> 02:25:11,659
[SPEAKER_19]: He's going to be doing some intermittent stuff on Monday nights from now on.

1789
02:25:11,759 --> 02:25:17,021
[SPEAKER_19]: He doesn't really want to go through the effort to make a new LiveWire every single week, because believe it or not, it's a lot of work.

1790
02:25:18,082 --> 02:25:22,743
[SPEAKER_19]: It's easier than just, you know, turn on the microphones and throw on some music like the rest of us do.

1791
02:25:24,664 --> 02:25:29,066
[SPEAKER_19]: So he's just going to do some stuff for Mondays intermittently.

1792
02:25:29,407 --> 02:25:32,908
[SPEAKER_19]: And hopefully we'll still have some special programming for you guys on Monday night.

1793
02:25:33,529 --> 02:25:36,750
[SPEAKER_19]: And Condition Zero will be back one of these days, won't it?

1794
02:25:39,131 --> 02:25:41,172
[SPEAKER_19]: Condition Zero will be back one of these days, won't it, Zero?

1795
02:25:41,412 --> 02:25:41,632
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes?

1796
02:25:41,793 --> 02:25:42,433
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1797
02:25:42,513 --> 02:25:43,453
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, good.

1798
02:25:44,134 --> 02:25:46,895
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, as promised, let's go back over to Ultramix.

1799
02:25:47,095 --> 02:25:50,777
[SPEAKER_19]: And they've just unlocked BLT style.

1800
02:25:50,857 --> 02:25:51,717
[SPEAKER_19]: So let's hear this.

1801
02:25:51,817 --> 02:25:52,698
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's play...

1802
02:25:54,784 --> 02:25:55,805
[SPEAKER_19]: Ooh, this might be too loud.

1803
02:25:55,845 --> 02:25:56,285
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, guys.

1804
02:25:56,305 --> 02:25:56,685
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, yeah.

1805
02:25:56,705 --> 02:25:58,186
[SPEAKER_11]: So did on a fourth style.

1806
02:25:58,306 --> 02:25:59,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, play it.

1807
02:26:50,947 --> 02:26:54,069
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course it's sped up just like you would have thought it would.

1808
02:26:54,830 --> 02:26:55,210
[SPEAKER_18]: Huh?

1809
02:26:56,571 --> 02:26:57,592
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, a little bit.

1810
02:27:00,494 --> 02:27:03,136
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sped up the same way as it does here in the fourth style.

1811
02:27:32,652 --> 02:27:38,458
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a lot of runs in this.

1812
02:27:39,079 --> 02:27:47,227
[SPEAKER_18]: It's very... Jonas is saying it looks like a mix of Orion and A.

1813
02:27:53,186 --> 02:27:53,746
[SPEAKER_18]: That was interesting.

1814
02:27:53,766 --> 02:27:55,967
[SPEAKER_19]: It was a little fast, but it's cool, I guess.

1815
02:27:55,987 --> 02:27:57,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's in 1.5 speed.

1816
02:27:57,987 --> 02:27:58,668
[SPEAKER_19]: Some fun steps.

1817
02:28:02,329 --> 02:28:07,870
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, Chowroom wants to hear Shiny Disco Balls.

1818
02:28:15,532 --> 02:28:16,533
[SPEAKER_19]: I like this song a lot.

1819
02:28:17,753 --> 02:28:20,954
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm hoping they didn't fuck it up, but apparently Zero says they have.

1820
02:28:30,106 --> 02:28:32,801
Discord, Discord, Discord, Discord, Discord, Discord

1821
02:28:57,467 --> 02:29:03,318
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, some folks in the room are saying this song has very karaoke steps to them, which, yeah, it kind of does.

1822
02:29:03,338 --> 02:29:07,325
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of disco, disco, one, two, one, yeah, very karaoke.

1823
02:29:14,011 --> 02:29:21,536
[SPEAKER_21]: This song is definitely one that you'll want to edit for the fact it's like just, disco, disco, disco, and that's the steps throughout the whole thing.

1824
02:29:22,096 --> 02:29:25,778
[SPEAKER_21]: And then when it gets cool, they just go back to what it was.

1825
02:29:26,459 --> 02:29:28,220
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, right after this.

1826
02:29:28,380 --> 02:29:29,380
[SPEAKER_20]: It's kind of disappointing.

1827
02:29:30,301 --> 02:29:31,602
[SPEAKER_22]: Have you noticed any new katas?

1828
02:29:34,517 --> 02:29:39,461
[SPEAKER_21]: There's, I think, Castle in the Sky is in CatEye.

1829
02:29:39,601 --> 02:29:40,102
[SPEAKER_21]: I know that.

1830
02:29:40,202 --> 02:29:41,282
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, on doubles I know this.

1831
02:29:41,383 --> 02:29:42,443
[SPEAKER_21]: On singles I know this.

1832
02:29:42,463 --> 02:29:43,444
[SPEAKER_21]: Definitely not.

1833
02:29:44,545 --> 02:29:46,647
[SPEAKER_21]: But this song is the worst.

1834
02:29:46,767 --> 02:29:48,228
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would be freestyle-able though?

1835
02:29:48,648 --> 02:29:49,990
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, it's freestyle-able.

1836
02:29:51,211 --> 02:29:56,555
[SPEAKER_21]: Definitely, but if you're just trying to play it for fun, you're not going to find a whole lot in that one.

1837
02:29:59,005 --> 02:30:03,567
[SPEAKER_19]: What I don't like is that they ripped the background from Fantasy from Max 2, the one by Lockout.

1838
02:30:04,387 --> 02:30:05,908
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a total rip-off of that background.

1839
02:30:05,948 --> 02:30:07,348
[SPEAKER_19]: Completely ripped off.

1840
02:30:09,789 --> 02:30:10,309
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1841
02:30:10,349 --> 02:30:12,550
[SPEAKER_02]: This song over music sucks, though.

1842
02:30:21,533 --> 02:30:25,095
[SPEAKER_18]: Chatroom wanted to hear the edit of Castles in the Sky, so here you guys go.

1843
02:30:25,775 --> 02:30:27,536
[SPEAKER_18]: And the background is a castle in the sky.

1844
02:30:27,596 --> 02:30:28,076
[SPEAKER_18]: Go figure.

1845
02:31:01,952 --> 02:31:04,433
[SPEAKER_18]: I was expecting there to be a slowdown there, but no.

1846
02:31:04,893 --> 02:31:06,133
[SPEAKER_02]: It slowed down marginally.

1847
02:31:07,274 --> 02:31:10,054
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still slowing down.

1848
02:31:10,294 --> 02:31:11,035
[SPEAKER_19]: Lots of freezes.

1849
02:31:11,955 --> 02:31:14,496
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's a consistent tempo change like with Insertion.

1850
02:31:26,465 --> 02:31:37,632
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, you usually don't see 16th note runs like that in licensed ones Yeah, there's been quite a few in this Some strange gallops there

1851
02:32:09,566 --> 02:32:10,086
[SPEAKER_18]: Interesting.

1852
02:32:10,366 --> 02:32:11,126
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't so bad.

1853
02:32:12,007 --> 02:32:15,187
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, and some folks wanted to hear the Metal Gear one, so we'll play that too.

1854
02:32:20,968 --> 02:32:23,629
[SPEAKER_22]: We're playing a DDR Ultramix here on Orange Lines Radio.

1855
02:32:28,770 --> 02:32:31,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this isn't the one I was thinking it was.

1856
02:32:31,250 --> 02:32:34,671
[SPEAKER_19]: No, it's the one from 6 and Core Home Version.

1857
02:33:29,008 --> 02:33:30,388
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm kind of surprised this is only a 7.

1858
02:33:30,869 --> 02:33:33,709
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a little more 8-ish to me, especially with the 16s in it.

1859
02:33:33,749 --> 02:33:34,409
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, it is an 8?

1860
02:33:34,550 --> 02:33:36,110
[SPEAKER_08]: This doesn't look that hard at all.

1861
02:33:37,310 --> 02:33:38,531
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, this looks more like a 6.

1862
02:33:38,971 --> 02:33:40,231
[SPEAKER_19]: It doesn't look hard to us.

1863
02:33:40,271 --> 02:33:42,652
[SPEAKER_19]: We're kind of jaded because we've beaten, you know, kind of stuff.

1864
02:33:42,672 --> 02:33:47,633
[SPEAKER_19]: But usually songs, once they get 16th notes in them and stuff, they're 8s.

1865
02:33:47,653 --> 02:33:49,774
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's all it surprises me.

1866
02:33:49,894 --> 02:33:51,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I would honestly rank this song a 7.

1867
02:33:55,995 --> 02:33:57,976
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they're opposing, they're easy to do.

1868
02:33:59,548 --> 02:34:02,590
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's just the same step being repeated, it's easy.

1869
02:34:03,451 --> 02:34:04,011
Hmm.

1870
02:34:04,031 --> 02:34:05,012
Very interesting.

1871
02:34:16,708 --> 02:34:18,249
[SPEAKER_19]: So folks want to know what the videos are like.

1872
02:34:18,329 --> 02:34:22,432
[SPEAKER_19]: Pretty much all the videos are just generic videos, just like you'd see in Max 2.

1873
02:34:22,472 --> 02:34:23,473
[SPEAKER_19]: They're recycled stuff.

1874
02:34:23,533 --> 02:34:28,476
[SPEAKER_19]: It looks like there are some new inserts, but even the new ones are pretty generic stuff.

1875
02:34:28,496 --> 02:34:30,977
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, lights and colors and dumb things like that.

1876
02:34:31,017 --> 02:34:36,361
[SPEAKER_19]: The only song that has a music video to it is the one with the half-naked men in it.

1877
02:34:36,621 --> 02:34:37,562
[SPEAKER_19]: The Maasai one.

1878
02:34:38,062 --> 02:34:38,662
[SPEAKER_19]: Do that thing.

1879
02:34:39,623 --> 02:34:40,343
[SPEAKER_18]: That was the only one.

1880
02:34:43,545 --> 02:34:44,686
[SPEAKER_18]: So is that it for Ultramix?

1881
02:34:44,706 --> 02:34:45,807
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you guys want to play one more or what?

1882
02:34:49,568 --> 02:34:54,330
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, we're going to do Keep Your Body Movin' by Thuggy D. Yeah, I played that one.

1883
02:34:54,870 --> 02:34:55,890
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh yeah, yeah, you did that one.

1884
02:34:55,910 --> 02:34:57,791
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to do the There For You.

1885
02:34:57,811 --> 02:34:59,251
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the one you haven't heard.

1886
02:35:00,632 --> 02:35:00,812
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

1887
02:35:00,872 --> 02:35:05,514
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, we're going to do There For You by Thuggy D. This will be the last one for now.

1888
02:35:05,634 --> 02:35:06,634
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we'll do Ask Orange Lounge.

1889
02:35:19,528 --> 02:35:23,172
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, one thing that sucks about this, for some reason, it can't run at slow speeds.

1890
02:35:23,752 --> 02:35:25,574
[SPEAKER_21]: It starts getting all jittery and crap.

1891
02:35:26,195 --> 02:35:30,198
[SPEAKER_21]: And it says it's like it's trying to load everything up, which it's the Xbox and it should be able to do it.

1892
02:35:30,619 --> 02:35:34,523
[SPEAKER_21]: But on really slower songs, it's almost like the arrows start shaking.

1893
02:35:34,543 --> 02:35:36,424
[SPEAKER_21]: It has the solo dogs.

1894
02:35:50,268 --> 02:35:51,429
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1895
02:35:51,669 --> 02:35:52,610
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like freeze arrows.

1896
02:35:53,551 --> 02:35:59,075
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like freeze arrows.

1897
02:36:00,296 --> 02:36:02,398
[SPEAKER_18]: Freeze arrows are good when used in moderation.

1898
02:36:03,158 --> 02:36:07,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but too many ones are just excessive on the freeze arrows.

1899
02:36:08,522 --> 02:36:11,265
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is, I don't play with freeze arrows anyway because of my angle.

1900
02:36:17,009 --> 02:36:19,131
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, Shining Polaris freeze arrows was real much...

1901
02:36:41,843 --> 02:36:42,684
[SPEAKER_18]: Wee, that was fun.

1902
02:36:44,245 --> 02:36:45,266
[SPEAKER_02]: That song did not excite me.

1903
02:36:45,286 --> 02:36:46,367
[SPEAKER_18]: That background looks very familiar.

1904
02:36:50,670 --> 02:36:51,591
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it's not Eat You Up.

1905
02:36:59,397 --> 02:37:00,738
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1906
02:37:01,479 --> 02:37:06,543
[SPEAKER_02]: The one thing in the 2DX video, because for the one for Let's Talk It Over, just had this girl there.

1907
02:37:07,455 --> 02:37:08,536
[SPEAKER_19]: Remix Remix Remix

1908
02:37:45,420 --> 02:37:45,942
[SPEAKER_16]: Remix

1909
02:38:39,665 --> 02:38:44,489
[SPEAKER_00]: Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Solid Snake, can you hear what I'm saying?

1910
02:38:44,729 --> 02:38:53,216
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this time the chicken man, they won't step back I'm gonna kill, I'm gonna beat him, kill him all Damn, what am I gonna do?

1911
02:38:53,256 --> 02:38:54,337
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, what am I gonna do?

1912
02:38:55,278 --> 02:38:56,419
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, what am I gonna do?

1913
02:38:56,439 --> 02:39:02,604
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, damn Have you ever seen a cool game like this?

1914
02:40:47,545 --> 02:40:48,506
Thanks for watching!

1915
02:41:36,212 --> 02:41:37,133
Thank you for watching!

1916
02:42:04,857 --> 02:42:08,158
This is a heartbeat This is a heartbeat

1917
02:42:29,893 --> 02:42:31,814
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1918
02:42:31,854 --> 02:42:33,235
[SPEAKER_19]: Here we are, Season 4 Premiere.

1919
02:42:33,275 --> 02:42:34,475
[SPEAKER_19]: Hope you're enjoying it so far.

1920
02:42:36,256 --> 02:42:43,700
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to MP3 Pro soon, probably over Thanksgiving, so don't be surprised if you hear a lot about how we've gone MP3 Pro.

1921
02:42:44,381 --> 02:42:54,306
[SPEAKER_19]: All that means is that if you have a special codec installed on your MP3 player, that you will be able to hear DSL quality streaming at a dial-up.

1922
02:42:55,177 --> 02:42:56,518
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for watching!

1923
02:43:14,052 --> 02:43:14,933
[SPEAKER_22]: 10 bucks for a 56k modem.

1924
02:43:15,034 --> 02:43:17,016
[SPEAKER_19]: I will buy you a modem.

1925
02:43:17,036 --> 02:43:25,024
[SPEAKER_19]: If you are seriously on 28.8 still, fucking email us at orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com so we may mock you openly before the switch.

1926
02:43:25,044 --> 02:43:26,586
[SPEAKER_02]: But it'll take them an hour to email us, Rob.

1927
02:43:26,606 --> 02:43:27,667
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it'll take them an hour to email us.

1928
02:43:28,087 --> 02:43:30,350
[SPEAKER_19]: But if you're on 33.6 or 56k, you'll still be fine.

1929
02:43:30,890 --> 02:43:32,152
[SPEAKER_19]: But the bitrate will be up in a little bit.

1930
02:43:35,296 --> 02:43:47,581
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright, I think my cell phone connects to the internet faster than 28.8, that's fucking sad Okay, as promised, we have a whole fucking ton of questions for this tonight, so let's get to it

1931
02:43:54,130 --> 02:43:57,112
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's Ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

1932
02:43:57,772 --> 02:44:00,834
[SPEAKER_19]: Will that ferret ever shut the fuck up on this show?

1933
02:44:01,554 --> 02:44:02,655
[SPEAKER_19]: I sure don't think so.

1934
02:44:03,175 --> 02:44:08,238
[SPEAKER_19]: As long as Jamie's around, she's gonna drive me nuts with that fucking ferret until I set it on fire.

1935
02:44:09,459 --> 02:44:11,520
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

1936
02:44:12,380 --> 02:44:15,442
[SPEAKER_19]: Question number one tonight, from Zodiac Knight.

1937
02:44:17,273 --> 02:44:21,536
[SPEAKER_19]: What Bomani songs of those that were never released on any DDR mix before?

1938
02:44:21,957 --> 02:44:29,202
[SPEAKER_19]: So what Bomani songs, not on a DDR mix yet, would you guys and gals like to see come out in future downloads for Ultrix?

1939
02:44:32,725 --> 02:44:36,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Infinite Prayer, Floating Flock Isn't that on there?

1940
02:44:36,728 --> 02:44:39,911
[SPEAKER_19]: No, that's... Oh, so the original Infinite Prayer, so you want Floating Flock, okay.

1941
02:44:40,991 --> 02:44:41,572
[SPEAKER_19]: That it, Amor?

1942
02:44:43,474 --> 02:44:43,894
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, Loki.

1943
02:44:45,615 --> 02:44:48,097
[SPEAKER_19]: Um... Oh, crap.

1944
02:44:48,657 --> 02:44:51,279
[SPEAKER_19]: Um... DJ Army.

1945
02:44:53,900 --> 02:44:56,582
[SPEAKER_02]: And, well, speaking of official, though, The Safari.

1946
02:44:57,082 --> 02:44:57,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Duh.

1947
02:44:57,983 --> 02:45:01,925
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, for me... All the other tech songs that weren't released.

1948
02:45:02,245 --> 02:45:05,987
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, Power... Bad Bye Baby Balloon is already in DDR.

1949
02:45:06,128 --> 02:45:08,329
[SPEAKER_19]: He asked for ones that are already in DDR, Migo.

1950
02:45:10,994 --> 02:45:12,435
[SPEAKER_19]: Starmind, Power Dream, Akira Yamaoka, Bitmania

1951
02:45:33,722 --> 02:45:35,663
[SPEAKER_19]: Love Me Do would be fucking the shit.

1952
02:45:36,223 --> 02:45:40,084
[SPEAKER_19]: Showa, the night style, the other night style one that's not Lion Suki.

1953
02:45:40,404 --> 02:45:43,665
[SPEAKER_19]: But Lion Suki would be good too, so just about anything in Kiriyamaoka.

1954
02:45:43,805 --> 02:45:44,285
[SPEAKER_19]: Panorama.

1955
02:45:44,785 --> 02:45:47,706
[SPEAKER_19]: Or Goonies Are Good Enough from Poppin' 10, please.

1956
02:45:47,886 --> 02:45:48,146
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1957
02:45:48,226 --> 02:45:48,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Panorama.

1958
02:45:49,186 --> 02:45:49,386
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1959
02:45:51,447 --> 02:45:55,008
[SPEAKER_19]: Anybody else have a thought for Bomani songs for Ultramix downloads?

1960
02:45:56,488 --> 02:46:06,074
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it would be cool to either see Traces, either the original or the remix, or to see... I can't think of it right now.

1961
02:46:07,935 --> 02:46:08,856
[SPEAKER_21]: Crap, I went blank.

1962
02:46:08,876 --> 02:46:11,378
[SPEAKER_21]: But it would be cool to see a good QQQ.

1963
02:46:11,598 --> 02:46:12,979
[SPEAKER_19]: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, Rizlam.

1964
02:46:13,399 --> 02:46:13,839
[SPEAKER_19]: Rizlam, please.

1965
02:46:13,959 --> 02:46:14,259
[SPEAKER_19]: Rizlam.

1966
02:46:14,780 --> 02:46:15,260
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1967
02:46:17,441 --> 02:46:22,465
[SPEAKER_19]: Wouldn't it be cool if we knew someone that could make an upgrade for an arcade cabinet?

1968
02:46:23,766 --> 02:46:25,527
[SPEAKER_19]: And they could put all these songs in there.

1969
02:46:26,613 --> 02:46:27,293
[SPEAKER_19]: That would be cool.

1970
02:46:27,333 --> 02:46:28,754
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that would be fucking great.

1971
02:46:28,794 --> 02:46:30,535
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's listen to the answer to the question.

1972
02:46:32,015 --> 02:46:32,395
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see.

1973
02:46:32,435 --> 02:46:34,396
[SPEAKER_17]: What songs for the Bebani?

1974
02:46:34,436 --> 02:46:34,936
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me see.

1975
02:46:34,956 --> 02:46:41,959
[SPEAKER_17]: There's some songs from DDSInfalls.com that seem good, like the V-Techno remix or the Abyss, the Heavens mix.

1976
02:46:44,020 --> 02:46:44,900
[SPEAKER_17]: That would sound good.

1977
02:46:46,201 --> 02:46:46,521
[SPEAKER_19]: Cool.

1978
02:46:48,121 --> 02:46:49,622
[SPEAKER_19]: I like 23rd Magus' idea.

1979
02:46:49,682 --> 02:46:50,662
[SPEAKER_19]: You should too, Jamie.

1980
02:46:51,063 --> 02:46:51,583
[SPEAKER_19]: Schlagwerk.

1981
02:46:51,683 --> 02:46:53,564
[SPEAKER_19]: How about Schlagwerk?

1982
02:46:53,904 --> 02:46:54,364
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what?

1983
02:46:55,287 --> 02:46:56,027
[SPEAKER_19]: Fuck 2DX.

1984
02:46:57,488 --> 02:47:00,689
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's put some Loki remixes in a DDR machine because he's got some pretty sweet ones.

1985
02:47:01,009 --> 02:47:01,749
[SPEAKER_19]: Miko, you have an idea?

1986
02:47:02,509 --> 02:47:03,569
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Monkey Dance.

1987
02:47:03,789 --> 02:47:04,410
[SPEAKER_19]: Monkey Dance.

1988
02:47:04,550 --> 02:47:07,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I also like, what is it called, Deadline.

1989
02:47:08,851 --> 02:47:10,051
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, Deadline would be a good one.

1990
02:47:10,091 --> 02:47:10,971
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, Deadline would be great.

1991
02:47:10,991 --> 02:47:12,452
[SPEAKER_07]: What about Beauty of Silence?

1992
02:47:14,833 --> 02:47:15,173
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1993
02:47:16,453 --> 02:47:16,793
[SPEAKER_19]: Cool.

1994
02:47:16,933 --> 02:47:17,193
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks.

1995
02:47:17,573 --> 02:47:17,813
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1996
02:47:18,514 --> 02:47:20,134
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's go on to the next question, shall we?

1997
02:47:20,154 --> 02:47:21,995
[SPEAKER_19]: Dark Child.

1998
02:47:23,939 --> 02:47:24,700
[SPEAKER_19]: How long is it really?

1999
02:47:24,720 --> 02:47:25,741
[SPEAKER_19]: Limp and fully extended?

2000
02:47:25,761 --> 02:47:26,642
[SPEAKER_19]: Zero is going to answer this.

2001
02:47:26,662 --> 02:47:30,607
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know how he knows the answer, but he wants to answer this.

2002
02:47:44,895 --> 02:47:48,638
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, if I bend at the elbow, it's about a foot long.

2003
02:47:48,678 --> 02:47:50,579
[SPEAKER_21]: God damn it, you stole my joke.

2004
02:47:51,520 --> 02:47:55,123
[SPEAKER_19]: If I put my arm straight out, it's about... I would say kind of limp.

2005
02:47:55,163 --> 02:48:05,951
[SPEAKER_19]: My finger is about two and a half inches, and when I fully extend that middle finger, as I'm doing right now, when I fully extend that middle finger, I think I'm hitting a good three inches there.

2006
02:48:06,612 --> 02:48:09,234
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not about the size of the boat, it's about the motion in the ocean.

2007
02:48:09,254 --> 02:48:11,816
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

2008
02:48:14,059 --> 02:48:17,582
[SPEAKER_02]: It's as big as you can airbrush it.

2009
02:48:17,682 --> 02:48:23,167
[SPEAKER_19]: John Fields would like to know, will you please play my remix of Air for everyone to hear?

2010
02:48:23,407 --> 02:48:23,587
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2011
02:48:25,789 --> 02:48:26,629
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe in the afterbirth.

2012
02:48:28,311 --> 02:48:32,194
[SPEAKER_19]: S Ghost would like to know, do you know why all the release dates for Ultramix are screwed up?

2013
02:48:33,155 --> 02:48:34,176
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't know they were screwed up.

2014
02:48:34,816 --> 02:48:36,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say thank you to Microsoft.

2015
02:48:36,718 --> 02:48:38,179
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's ask the guy that works at GameStop.

2016
02:48:41,866 --> 02:48:42,426
[SPEAKER_21]: I believe you.

2017
02:48:43,407 --> 02:48:46,489
[SPEAKER_21]: No, it's actually not that the release dates were messed up.

2018
02:48:47,070 --> 02:48:59,738
[SPEAKER_20]: It's that they, at the last minute, announced, basically about four days before they decided to do it, that instead of being out on December 3rd, it was actually going to be out with the pad and the game packaged.

2019
02:49:00,118 --> 02:49:01,439
[SPEAKER_20]: It was going to be out on the 18th.

2020
02:49:01,559 --> 02:49:03,741
[SPEAKER_20]: It was kind of something they didn't really push out.

2021
02:49:04,501 --> 02:49:11,646
[SPEAKER_20]: And then, as far as I know, check it, December 3rd has always been the original release date.

2022
02:49:17,011 --> 02:49:20,274
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm getting yelled at for not answering that limp question, honestly.

2023
02:49:22,195 --> 02:49:22,716
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see.

2024
02:49:23,036 --> 02:49:24,037
[SPEAKER_19]: Microflacid.

2025
02:49:24,698 --> 02:49:28,061
[SPEAKER_19]: Ninst would like to know, this is a good question being asked by Ninst here.

2026
02:49:28,841 --> 02:49:32,805
[SPEAKER_19]: Why, oh why, are Magus' jokes so horribly bad?

2027
02:49:33,646 --> 02:49:34,046
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

2028
02:49:35,928 --> 02:49:38,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the originator of the jokes.

2029
02:49:38,170 --> 02:49:38,330
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

2030
02:49:40,146 --> 02:49:41,989
[SPEAKER_02]: and the amount of a true sense of humor.

2031
02:49:42,549 --> 02:49:43,250
[SPEAKER_02]: You're so mean.

2032
02:49:43,791 --> 02:49:44,332
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I am.

2033
02:49:44,372 --> 02:49:44,973
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I'm here.

2034
02:49:46,695 --> 02:49:46,935
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

2035
02:49:47,956 --> 02:49:50,580
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just like you have to understand your place in this world.

2036
02:49:50,840 --> 02:49:53,864
[SPEAKER_19]: I wasn't meant to sing, so I try not to.

2037
02:49:54,385 --> 02:49:57,189
[SPEAKER_19]: He wasn't meant to be funny, so he should try not to.

2038
02:49:59,699 --> 02:50:00,559
[SPEAKER_21]: See, it's really cool.

2039
02:50:00,579 --> 02:50:01,740
[SPEAKER_21]: You gotta look at it this way.

2040
02:50:02,240 --> 02:50:08,563
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, his jokes are so bad because he takes all that power from his freestyling and he puts it into his jokes.

2041
02:50:09,264 --> 02:50:14,546
[SPEAKER_21]: And it just makes him so bad that, I mean, you know, you can't help but say a horrible error.

2042
02:50:17,387 --> 02:50:24,471
[SPEAKER_17]: Speaking of freestyle, imagine how he's gonna... I wonder what the judge is gonna say if he even participates in the tournaments.

2043
02:50:26,752 --> 02:50:27,292
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead, Jonas.

2044
02:50:28,928 --> 02:50:30,949
[SPEAKER_17]: But, that's all I got to say.

2045
02:50:32,389 --> 02:50:32,889
[SPEAKER_17]: No comment.

2046
02:50:34,029 --> 02:50:39,411
[SPEAKER_21]: You're saying fuck you to Jamie when I'm the one who just totally, like... Buffer.

2047
02:50:39,591 --> 02:50:42,071
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't forget there are about a minute and 30 seconds left.

2048
02:50:42,091 --> 02:50:45,252
[SPEAKER_19]: That's all I got to say, you know.

2049
02:50:46,593 --> 02:50:51,094
[SPEAKER_19]: But you know what, in all seriousness, he's a good sport for putting up with our shit, because we're really fucking mean to him.

2050
02:50:52,114 --> 02:50:55,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear, just translate it into Portuguese and he'll be hilarious.

2051
02:50:57,498 --> 02:50:58,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Even funnier if he tries to read it.

2052
02:51:03,082 --> 02:51:03,442
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

2053
02:51:05,343 --> 02:51:05,824
[SPEAKER_17]: Moving on.

2054
02:51:05,864 --> 02:51:08,125
[SPEAKER_17]: Shit happens, 23rd of August.

2055
02:51:10,307 --> 02:51:12,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, shit happens, but eventually you flush.

2056
02:51:14,870 --> 02:51:15,190
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

2057
02:51:16,107 --> 02:51:22,769
[SPEAKER_19]: Dark Tetsuya would like to know, did Jamie ever get to hear QQQAzar, and if so, what were her thoughts on it?

2058
02:51:23,389 --> 02:51:24,110
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, no.

2059
02:51:24,130 --> 02:51:25,070
[SPEAKER_19]: There's two versions.

2060
02:51:25,150 --> 02:51:27,231
[SPEAKER_19]: There's the one that Angel did, and there's the one that Loki did.

2061
02:51:27,471 --> 02:51:29,891
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's two versions, and she's heard neither one.

2062
02:51:30,231 --> 02:51:31,372
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that I ever have, yeah.

2063
02:51:31,832 --> 02:51:33,553
[SPEAKER_19]: So, maybe we'll send them to her later.

2064
02:51:37,154 --> 02:51:37,994
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, let's see.

2065
02:51:40,075 --> 02:51:41,435
[SPEAKER_19]: DJ Dark Knight.

2066
02:51:41,975 --> 02:51:43,136
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, he has DJ in his name.

2067
02:51:43,156 --> 02:51:44,156
[SPEAKER_19]: He must be a 2DX player.

2068
02:51:44,416 --> 02:51:44,516
Hmm.

2069
02:51:45,871 --> 02:51:47,393
[SPEAKER_19]: Just messing, just messing.

2070
02:51:47,934 --> 02:51:48,615
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't like that shit.

2071
02:51:48,635 --> 02:51:51,800
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't like people that try to tell other people what they can and can't put in your name.

2072
02:51:51,960 --> 02:51:54,865
[SPEAKER_22]: If you want to be DJ whatever, go fucking for it.

2073
02:51:58,377 --> 02:51:58,897
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for watching!

2074
02:52:21,912 --> 02:52:22,854
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you have something you wanted to say?

2075
02:52:22,874 --> 02:52:26,339
[SPEAKER_17]: I was going to say F you for people who call themselves DJs and everything.

2076
02:52:26,720 --> 02:52:27,541
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, you know what?

2077
02:52:28,022 --> 02:52:28,383
[SPEAKER_17]: Let them.

2078
02:52:28,883 --> 02:52:30,206
[SPEAKER_22]: What does it take to be a DJ?

2079
02:52:31,474 --> 02:52:32,094
[SPEAKER_22]: Not a lot.

2080
02:52:32,614 --> 02:52:33,134
[SPEAKER_22]: Look at us.

2081
02:52:33,214 --> 02:52:33,875
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, yeah.

2082
02:52:33,915 --> 02:52:34,435
[SPEAKER_22]: Look at us.

2083
02:52:34,615 --> 02:52:35,735
[SPEAKER_22]: We're radio DJs.

2084
02:52:36,215 --> 02:52:42,797
[SPEAKER_19]: I have every right, by those standards, if you have to be a real DJ to call yourself DJ whatever, I have every right to go around and call myself DJ Sky.

2085
02:52:43,057 --> 02:52:46,158
[SPEAKER_19]: And she can call herself DJ DarkSakura, and he can call himself DJ Loki.

2086
02:52:46,418 --> 02:52:48,138
[SPEAKER_02]: We... What do we do?

2087
02:52:48,178 --> 02:52:49,098
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on the radio.

2088
02:52:49,318 --> 02:52:49,838
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that's right.

2089
02:52:49,878 --> 02:52:50,699
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're radio DJs.

2090
02:52:51,039 --> 02:52:51,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

2091
02:52:51,759 --> 02:52:52,099
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.

2092
02:52:52,139 --> 02:52:53,559
[SPEAKER_19]: So we have every right to call ourselves DJ.

2093
02:52:53,699 --> 02:52:55,520
[SPEAKER_02]: And my DJ Celica is actually from 2DX.

2094
02:52:57,440 --> 02:52:58,561
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't want to be a DJ.

2095
02:52:58,721 --> 02:53:00,081
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't like her in Full House.

2096
02:53:08,098 --> 02:53:08,359
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

2097
02:53:09,823 --> 02:53:11,006
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh yeah, he did have a question.

2098
02:53:11,548 --> 02:53:12,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, a question.

2099
02:53:13,317 --> 02:53:17,818
[SPEAKER_19]: I heard rumors that Sony was going to do a karaoke revolution game themselves.

2100
02:53:17,898 --> 02:53:18,878
[SPEAKER_19]: I saw it on a website.

2101
02:53:18,938 --> 02:53:19,518
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that true?

2102
02:53:20,119 --> 02:53:22,959
[SPEAKER_19]: Meaning that Sony was making a karaoke revolution type game themselves.

2103
02:53:23,819 --> 02:53:25,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there is something like that.

2104
02:53:25,120 --> 02:53:35,022
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, we did report it on Vanilla Sky earlier this week that Sony has asked the folks behind the iToy, because the iToy has done so well, to look into the possibilities of doing something karaoke related.

2105
02:53:35,882 --> 02:53:36,163
[SPEAKER_19]: Stop!

2106
02:53:36,603 --> 02:53:36,703
[SPEAKER_19]: Stop!

2107
02:53:50,555 --> 02:53:51,515
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't care!

2108
02:53:51,535 --> 02:53:52,816
[SPEAKER_19]: How's it going under my foot?

2109
02:53:53,016 --> 02:53:53,776
[SPEAKER_19]: I swear!

2110
02:54:15,993 --> 02:54:17,674
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I have to address this in the chatroom, though.

2111
02:54:17,974 --> 02:54:20,595
[SPEAKER_19]: They're saying that they have the right to call themselves BJ.

2112
02:54:21,515 --> 02:54:22,475
[SPEAKER_19]: Then go do it!

2113
02:54:23,195 --> 02:54:28,917
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyways, no, um, you don't happen to remember that one karaoke game I showed you at the store.

2114
02:54:28,937 --> 02:54:31,158
[SPEAKER_21]: I do remember that, the one in the really ugly box.

2115
02:54:31,258 --> 02:54:34,339
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, the one we put at the very back of the store, hopefully nobody would see.

2116
02:54:34,759 --> 02:54:35,800
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, piece of shit.

2117
02:54:36,760 --> 02:54:39,661
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what... What the fuck would I play that shit for?

2118
02:54:39,681 --> 02:54:40,401
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just curious.

2119
02:54:40,881 --> 02:54:45,143
[SPEAKER_21]: The only cool thing, it comes with three discs of karaoke music and nothing else, because it's shit.

2120
02:54:49,474 --> 02:54:50,535
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you threw it too low.

2121
02:54:51,996 --> 02:54:53,077
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

2122
02:54:54,198 --> 02:54:56,360
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope no one buys that because you know what's going to happen.

2123
02:54:56,380 --> 02:54:58,741
[SPEAKER_02]: If one person buys it, they'll send your store 20 copies.

2124
02:55:02,044 --> 02:55:02,424
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

2125
02:55:02,985 --> 02:55:04,846
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe I ought to go in and buy it then, just to see.

2126
02:55:07,368 --> 02:55:08,469
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

2127
02:55:08,529 --> 02:55:13,013
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things I'm thinking of doing is actually getting the PC version of Pump It Up.

2128
02:55:14,194 --> 02:55:14,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2129
02:55:14,744 --> 02:55:18,526
[SPEAKER_02]: To get the new one with all the newer songs on it, though.

2130
02:55:19,787 --> 02:55:22,089
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can play it in my new room upstairs.

2131
02:55:23,650 --> 02:55:23,910
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2132
02:55:24,150 --> 02:55:25,771
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Pump It Up.

2133
02:55:25,791 --> 02:55:27,312
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll have more news on that as we know it.

2134
02:55:27,352 --> 02:55:28,473
[SPEAKER_19]: But Namtai's working on something.

2135
02:55:28,493 --> 02:55:30,334
[SPEAKER_19]: They're also doing a dance game for the iToys.

2136
02:55:30,394 --> 02:55:33,436
[SPEAKER_19]: So they're ripping off Konami's ideas left and right.

2137
02:55:33,476 --> 02:55:34,377
[SPEAKER_19]: So we'll see what happens.

2138
02:55:35,836 --> 02:55:36,957
[SPEAKER_19]: Jazz has a question.

2139
02:55:37,678 --> 02:55:39,699
[SPEAKER_19]: When is Rob on Final Fantasy XI?

2140
02:55:40,440 --> 02:55:44,483
[SPEAKER_19]: You can find me on the Bismarck server on Final Fantasy XI, usually in the evenings.

2141
02:55:45,403 --> 02:55:47,104
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki has a smart ass answer, I'm sure.

2142
02:55:48,646 --> 02:55:49,186
[SPEAKER_02]: All the time.

2143
02:55:50,347 --> 02:55:51,948
[SPEAKER_19]: I was just going to say I was on there too.

2144
02:55:52,429 --> 02:55:57,172
[SPEAKER_19]: Since he says I have a smart ass answer, yeah, he's always on there because he doesn't have a life.

2145
02:55:57,613 --> 02:55:59,634
[SPEAKER_19]: He just plays Final Fantasy XI all the time.

2146
02:55:59,734 --> 02:56:00,235
[SPEAKER_08]: And sleeps.

2147
02:56:00,475 --> 02:56:01,255
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm on there too.

2148
02:56:01,376 --> 02:56:02,236
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm Tomosuke.

2149
02:56:02,316 --> 02:56:05,399
[SPEAKER_19]: You'll see me butchering rabbits left and right because that's what I do.

2150
02:56:06,239 --> 02:56:06,900
[SPEAKER_08]: You butcher rabbits.

2151
02:56:06,920 --> 02:56:08,281
[SPEAKER_19]: I butcher small, innocent animals.

2152
02:56:08,541 --> 02:56:11,764
[SPEAKER_19]: Since there's no kittens in the game, rabbits will have to suffice.

2153
02:56:12,824 --> 02:56:13,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2154
02:56:13,925 --> 02:56:14,265
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

2155
02:56:14,305 --> 02:56:16,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that I can play that game because I got motion sick watching Rob.

2156
02:56:18,749 --> 02:56:19,590
[SPEAKER_18]: Just play it blindfolded.

2157
02:56:20,544 --> 02:56:21,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Blink Blink

2158
02:56:24,342 --> 02:56:25,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Play more Ragnarok.

2159
02:56:25,623 --> 02:56:26,023
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

2160
02:56:26,544 --> 02:56:29,225
[SPEAKER_19]: You can play on the Ragnarok server or from SC11.

2161
02:56:29,806 --> 02:56:29,986
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2162
02:56:30,246 --> 02:56:30,847
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll play Ragnarok.

2163
02:56:30,867 --> 02:56:31,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2164
02:56:32,147 --> 02:56:32,508
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

2165
02:56:33,388 --> 02:56:33,949
[SPEAKER_19]: Almost done.

2166
02:56:33,989 --> 02:56:35,009
[SPEAKER_19]: No more questions, please.

2167
02:56:35,069 --> 02:56:36,330
[SPEAKER_19]: We have to wrap up this segment.

2168
02:56:37,751 --> 02:56:43,475
[SPEAKER_19]: Jazz would also like to know, and why don't you listen to me and check out Graduizic Cyber on Doubles Wii?

2169
02:56:43,855 --> 02:56:46,037
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not Graduistic.

2170
02:56:46,057 --> 02:56:47,638
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Graduizic.

2171
02:56:48,198 --> 02:56:48,598
[SPEAKER_19]: Whatever.

2172
02:56:48,618 --> 02:56:49,239
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Gradius.

2173
02:56:49,659 --> 02:56:52,601
[SPEAKER_19]: New 10-footers, especially on American Mix, should get talked about.

2174
02:56:54,707 --> 02:56:56,088
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a new 10-footer on doubles.

2175
02:56:57,269 --> 02:56:57,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay.

2176
02:56:58,329 --> 02:56:59,350
[SPEAKER_19]: Hooray, 10-footer.

2177
02:56:59,430 --> 02:57:01,871
[SPEAKER_19]: It would be nice if it was easier to play doubles at home.

2178
02:57:05,714 --> 02:57:06,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.

2179
02:57:07,615 --> 02:57:13,379
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the first Otakuto video reference I've seen in like 20, like forever.

2180
02:57:16,480 --> 02:57:23,285
[SPEAKER_19]: Jason would like to ask, why is it that when I have Orange Lounge Radio turned up high and Papa Music 8 turned up just enough to hear it,

2181
02:57:24,076 --> 02:57:30,458
[SPEAKER_19]: that I can do so much better on songs than when Papa Music Aid is blaring and of course the only music sound being made.

2182
02:57:31,198 --> 02:57:33,519
[SPEAKER_19]: So why is it when Orange Lounge Radio is on he does even better?

2183
02:57:35,740 --> 02:57:36,220
[SPEAKER_19]: Any thoughts?

2184
02:57:36,400 --> 02:57:37,660
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that that made sense.

2185
02:57:37,720 --> 02:57:41,141
[SPEAKER_19]: Because our enchanted voodoo powers make it possible.

2186
02:57:44,362 --> 02:57:45,343
[SPEAKER_19]: Because we're great.

2187
02:57:45,663 --> 02:57:46,263
[SPEAKER_19]: End of story.

2188
02:57:49,223 --> 02:58:16,670
[SPEAKER_19]: and Dark Child would like to know how long is my penis but unfortunately we're out of time so we'll have to table that question next week sorry gang and we're going to close up the whole I'm such a bitch we're going to close up the whole little Ask Orange Lounge hope you learned something and now it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought Zero, your final thought for tonight

2189
02:58:17,785 --> 02:58:19,786
[SPEAKER_19]: If you don't know how long it is, you probably can't see it.

2190
02:58:20,667 --> 02:58:21,908
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey now, I don't like where you're going with that.

2191
02:58:23,449 --> 02:58:24,630
[SPEAKER_19]: That's kind of where it stops.

2192
02:58:24,670 --> 02:58:25,070
[SPEAKER_19]: Shut up.

2193
02:58:26,491 --> 02:58:27,071
[SPEAKER_19]: Jeez!

2194
02:58:28,893 --> 02:58:29,453
[SPEAKER_19]: Moving on.

2195
02:58:32,095 --> 02:58:32,615
[SPEAKER_19]: Who's next?

2196
02:58:32,895 --> 02:58:33,235
[SPEAKER_19]: Jonas.

2197
02:58:33,976 --> 02:58:34,796
Any last words?

2198
02:58:34,816 --> 02:58:35,937
[SPEAKER_19]: Any final thoughts?

2199
02:58:37,999 --> 02:58:39,560
[SPEAKER_17]: Not really much thought about it.

2200
02:58:39,720 --> 02:58:39,820
[SPEAKER_17]: Just...

2201
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:44,161
[SPEAKER_17]: Really not much.

2202
02:58:44,361 --> 02:58:48,662
[SPEAKER_17]: Except the fact that I got 23rd Magus thinking about the next tournament, what he's going to do.

2203
02:58:50,142 --> 02:58:51,883
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, Dark Child, you know I'm joking.

2204
02:58:52,043 --> 02:58:52,323
[SPEAKER_19]: Shut up.

2205
02:58:53,864 --> 02:58:54,224
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

2206
02:58:55,964 --> 02:58:57,985
[SPEAKER_19]: Miko, any last thoughts?

2207
02:58:58,545 --> 02:58:59,185
[SPEAKER_19]: Any final words?

2208
02:59:01,506 --> 02:59:02,066
[SPEAKER_06]: About what?

2209
02:59:02,746 --> 02:59:03,366
[SPEAKER_19]: About anything.

2210
02:59:03,947 --> 02:59:04,587
[SPEAKER_19]: Your final thought.

2211
02:59:04,607 --> 02:59:05,607
[SPEAKER_19]: Jerry Springer's final thought.

2212
02:59:05,627 --> 02:59:05,987
[SPEAKER_19]: What is it?

2213
02:59:09,188 --> 02:59:09,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Be safe.

2214
02:59:10,589 --> 02:59:11,289
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, be safe.

2215
02:59:12,452 --> 02:59:40,192
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, be happy too, be happy too, DarkSakura, your final thought, Portobella Mushroom, Portobella, Portobella, is that it, alright, Loki, your final thought, go visit Japanese sim file sites, because they're better than US ones anyways, because I just decided to do that, my final thought is, hi,

2216
02:59:42,733 --> 02:59:43,073
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess.

2217
02:59:43,433 --> 02:59:44,634
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess I have nothing better to say.

2218
02:59:44,874 --> 02:59:45,474
[SPEAKER_19]: I like cheese.

2219
02:59:46,055 --> 02:59:46,655
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, Jonas?

2220
02:59:46,855 --> 02:59:48,096
[SPEAKER_19]: I got one more to say.

2221
02:59:48,116 --> 02:59:48,696
[SPEAKER_19]: Something extra?

2222
02:59:49,657 --> 02:59:50,037
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

2223
02:59:50,778 --> 02:59:51,578
[SPEAKER_17]: Here's some advice.

2224
02:59:52,019 --> 02:59:54,280
[SPEAKER_17]: Quit the goddamn Edison, Bimani style.

2225
02:59:54,340 --> 02:59:58,483
[SPEAKER_17]: No one wants to play a 10-foot Edison from Max 300 or Pink Dinosaur or whatever.

2226
02:59:58,543 --> 03:00:00,024
[SPEAKER_17]: It's time.

2227
03:00:01,224 --> 03:00:01,985
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been a 10-

2228
03:00:09,440 --> 03:00:17,383
[SPEAKER_19]: I have a word of advice for those folks making 10-foot edits to Max remixes and things like that.

2229
03:00:17,643 --> 03:00:18,563
[SPEAKER_19]: Go outside.

2230
03:00:18,803 --> 03:00:19,383
[SPEAKER_19]: Seriously.

2231
03:00:19,583 --> 03:00:21,624
[SPEAKER_19]: Go outside and take in some fresh air.

2232
03:00:21,864 --> 03:00:22,344
[SPEAKER_19]: Seriously.

2233
03:00:22,824 --> 03:00:23,145
[SPEAKER_19]: Please.

2234
03:00:23,285 --> 03:00:23,965
[SPEAKER_19]: Make some friends.

2235
03:00:24,145 --> 03:00:24,765
[SPEAKER_19]: Get a girlfriend.

2236
03:00:24,785 --> 03:00:25,205
[SPEAKER_19]: Get laid.

2237
03:00:25,525 --> 03:00:26,105
[SPEAKER_19]: Do some good.

2238
03:00:26,706 --> 03:00:27,006
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

2239
03:00:30,032 --> 03:00:34,076
[SPEAKER_19]: Tonight's final word, I'm going to give tonight's final word of the show to Miko.

2240
03:00:34,637 --> 03:00:38,260
[SPEAKER_19]: So one word, one word that sums everything up for you Miko right now.

2241
03:00:41,063 --> 03:00:42,024
[SPEAKER_06]: A one letter word?

2242
03:00:42,264 --> 03:00:43,926
[SPEAKER_12]: Just one word, no one word.

2243
03:00:44,186 --> 03:00:44,667
[SPEAKER_06]: One word.

2244
03:00:46,108 --> 03:00:46,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

2245
03:00:46,549 --> 03:00:46,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

2246
03:00:47,563 --> 03:00:50,545
[SPEAKER_12]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2247
03:00:51,105 --> 03:00:54,447
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

2248
03:00:55,047 --> 03:01:00,251
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

2249
03:01:00,491 --> 03:01:10,937
[SPEAKER_12]: If you'd like to leave us a comment, send us an email at orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2250
03:01:11,870 --> 03:01:14,231
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew up in San Francisco.

2251
03:01:14,652 --> 03:01:20,054
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew up in the midst of Polk Street, Hanky Code, Poppers, San Francisco.

2252
03:01:20,615 --> 03:01:21,915
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's like my childhood.

2253
03:01:21,995 --> 03:01:24,677
[SPEAKER_05]: So I feel really comfortable in talking about it.

2254
03:01:24,717 --> 03:01:31,380
[SPEAKER_05]: My parents owned a bookstore on Polk Street, and my mother was in charge of the gay porn.

2255
03:01:32,661 --> 03:01:33,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is like crazy.

2256
03:01:34,642 --> 03:01:37,904
[SPEAKER_05]: She would pull out these books and show me to talk about it.

2257
03:01:39,642 --> 03:01:44,706
[SPEAKER_03]: This book, this book, it's called Ace Master.

2258
03:01:50,931 --> 03:01:52,553
[SPEAKER_03]: What is an Ace Master?

2259
03:01:54,874 --> 03:01:55,555
[SPEAKER_03]: What is that?

2260
03:01:55,695 --> 03:01:57,096
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what Ace Master is.

2261
03:01:57,136 --> 03:01:58,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you need an Ace Master?

2262
03:02:03,641 --> 03:02:05,503
[SPEAKER_03]: This book is an Ace Master.

2263
03:02:09,989 --> 03:02:14,832
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought this is a gay, the book for gay, because mommy know about the gay.

2264
03:02:17,214 --> 03:02:20,335
[SPEAKER_04]: The gay, they like ass.

2265
03:02:20,956 --> 03:02:21,616
[SPEAKER_04]: They do.

2266
03:02:22,337 --> 03:02:24,498
[SPEAKER_04]: They like ass so much.

2267
03:02:25,098 --> 03:02:29,721
[SPEAKER_04]: They like ass, but they like ass too much.

2268
03:02:33,163 --> 03:02:36,365
[SPEAKER_04]: You hear two people, ass in moderation.

2269
03:02:46,480 --> 03:02:48,622
[SPEAKER_04]: You cannot have an ass all the time.

2270
03:02:48,642 --> 03:02:49,843
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?

2271
03:02:52,325 --> 03:02:58,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you have an ass all the time, then it's not special.

2272
03:03:03,854 --> 03:03:05,215
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what mom is saying?

2273
03:03:05,235 --> 03:03:06,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that, that is...

2274
03:03:07,116 --> 03:03:09,840
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a boy, and his name is Paul.

2275
03:03:10,361 --> 03:03:12,003
[SPEAKER_04]: And mommy like Paul.

2276
03:03:12,044 --> 03:03:17,372
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a nice boy, but he's gay, and he only like to sing.

2277
03:03:17,812 --> 03:03:19,214
[SPEAKER_04]: He like A.S.

2278
03:03:19,455 --> 03:03:20,396
[SPEAKER_04]: and Judy Garland.

2279
03:03:20,456 --> 03:03:20,957
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's all.

2280
03:03:26,269 --> 03:03:28,631
[SPEAKER_04]: And what kind of life is it like that?

2281
03:03:30,293 --> 03:03:31,174
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.

2282
03:03:31,975 --> 03:03:36,919
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's an ace and an ace over the rainbow, and that's all.

2283
03:03:39,842 --> 03:03:41,403
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why they do this.

2284
03:03:44,146 --> 03:03:46,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have to look at this book with the ace, mister.

2285
03:03:48,630 --> 03:03:50,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody's going to look at this book.

2286
03:03:50,512 --> 03:03:51,433
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to look at it.

2287
03:03:52,526 --> 03:03:55,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Mami, look at Mami, gonna look at Ace Mister now.

2288
03:03:55,448 --> 03:04:00,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Mami gonna look at Ace Mister now, look at Mami, okay, look at Mami, look at Mami.

2289
03:04:02,593 --> 03:04:03,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Ace Mister.

2290
03:04:16,029 --> 03:04:20,771
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't... I thought I was shocked, you know.

2291
03:04:21,911 --> 03:04:23,452
[SPEAKER_09]: I was so shocked.

2292
03:04:23,892 --> 03:04:26,092
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just ass right away, you know.

2293
03:04:26,172 --> 03:04:31,154
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a miracle.

2294
03:04:31,274 --> 03:04:35,816
Oh my God.

2295
03:04:37,006 --> 03:04:40,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2296
03:05:23,908 --> 03:05:30,493
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome everybody to the Orange Lounge Radio Afterbirth for the parts that were too hot for Orange Lounge Radio.

2297
03:05:30,533 --> 03:05:31,394
[SPEAKER_19]: You can hear them now.

2298
03:05:33,295 --> 03:05:35,717
[SPEAKER_19]: So any afterbirth thoughts, Jamie?

2299
03:05:39,741 --> 03:05:41,622
[SPEAKER_19]: You were looking at some interesting movies earlier.

2300
03:05:44,264 --> 03:05:45,305
[SPEAKER_19]: I think your mic might be off.

2301
03:05:46,546 --> 03:05:47,767
[SPEAKER_19]: Check the mic, make sure it's not off.

2302
03:05:49,088 --> 03:05:52,691
[SPEAKER_02]: This has got Sable in it in a bad fake porn thing.

2303
03:05:53,531 --> 03:05:55,153
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's widescreen so it's forgiven.

2304
03:05:56,674 --> 03:05:58,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Pan and Scan sucks.

2305
03:05:59,716 --> 03:06:01,137
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I don't like Pan and Scan either.

2306
03:06:02,758 --> 03:06:05,700
[SPEAKER_19]: Pan and Scan is bad because you lose a part of the picture.

2307
03:06:07,382 --> 03:06:11,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone who says that the black bars cut off the screen is an idiot.

2308
03:06:12,903 --> 03:06:15,465
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

2309
03:06:42,856 --> 03:06:43,516
[SPEAKER_19]: A show-a-thon?

2310
03:06:43,596 --> 03:06:44,517
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a show-a-thon.

2311
03:06:44,637 --> 03:06:45,037
[SPEAKER_19]: How so?

2312
03:06:45,557 --> 03:06:48,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, just take those two DVDs and watch them back-to-back.

2313
03:06:48,998 --> 03:06:49,559
[SPEAKER_19]: Fine by me.

2314
03:06:49,819 --> 03:06:51,759
[SPEAKER_19]: And I have her new CD, except I left it at work.

2315
03:06:52,760 --> 03:06:53,540
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't.

2316
03:06:55,041 --> 03:06:55,661
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

2317
03:06:55,741 --> 03:06:59,142
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, just to break up the show-ness, watch Rejected.

2318
03:07:00,103 --> 03:07:00,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2319
03:07:00,963 --> 03:07:09,066
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I hear that on Bitter Films, that Made Rejected has a new compilation coming out, which should be good.

2320
03:07:09,893 --> 03:07:10,974
[SPEAKER_19]: It's going to be a bunch of their stuff.

2321
03:07:11,234 --> 03:07:13,955
[SPEAKER_19]: And they showed Billy's Balloon at Spike and Mike's and that made me happy.

2322
03:07:13,975 --> 03:07:15,156
[SPEAKER_19]: Because Billy's Balloon is great.

2323
03:07:15,176 --> 03:07:17,057
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I love when balloons beat up little children.

2324
03:07:19,459 --> 03:07:20,379
[SPEAKER_19]: Have you seen Billy's Balloon?

2325
03:07:20,599 --> 03:07:20,739
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2326
03:07:20,840 --> 03:07:21,700
[SPEAKER_19]: That's fucking great.

2327
03:07:21,720 --> 03:07:22,300
[SPEAKER_19]: You've got to see it.

2328
03:07:25,162 --> 03:07:32,847
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess that's pretty much it for our little afterbirth.

2329
03:07:34,788 --> 03:07:36,269
[SPEAKER_19]: Tonight in the post-show...

2330
03:07:37,625 --> 03:07:40,186
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to start it off with that air remix I promised.

2331
03:07:42,027 --> 03:07:42,767
[SPEAKER_19]: If I can find it.

2332
03:07:42,908 --> 03:07:44,128
[SPEAKER_19]: I know I've got it in here somewhere.

2333
03:07:45,409 --> 03:07:46,549
[SPEAKER_19]: TikTok, TikTok, TikTok.

2334
03:07:48,010 --> 03:07:48,530
[SPEAKER_19]: I had it.

2335
03:07:48,750 --> 03:07:49,431
[SPEAKER_19]: Did I get rid of it?

2336
03:07:52,252 --> 03:07:53,913
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think I would have deleted it, but I don't.

2337
03:07:53,973 --> 03:07:54,413
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, there it is.

2338
03:07:54,593 --> 03:07:55,073
[SPEAKER_19]: There it is.

2339
03:07:55,854 --> 03:07:57,995
[SPEAKER_02]: If your anus is bleeding, use a tampon.

2340
03:07:58,415 --> 03:08:01,016
[SPEAKER_19]: I just got a copy of this Japanese say of max 30,000.

2341
03:08:02,357 --> 03:08:03,377
[SPEAKER_19]: It's two seconds long.

2342
03:08:07,045 --> 03:08:10,207
[SPEAKER_19]: That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard of in my entire life.

2343
03:08:10,227 --> 03:08:15,731
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you going to play it?

2344
03:08:15,771 --> 03:08:18,233
[SPEAKER_08]: For the word of God and all that is holy.

2345
03:08:18,633 --> 03:08:19,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Play it.

2346
03:08:19,073 --> 03:08:20,774
[SPEAKER_08]: My anus is bleeding.

2347
03:08:20,814 --> 03:08:22,195
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to hear max 30,000.

2348
03:08:25,858 --> 03:08:26,318
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow.

2349
03:08:26,458 --> 03:08:27,339
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

2350
03:08:28,960 --> 03:08:30,801
[SPEAKER_19]: That sounded like me shitting.

2351
03:08:32,442 --> 03:08:35,945
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a robot taking a shit.

2352
03:08:37,303 --> 03:08:37,944
[SPEAKER_19]: Aw, bye, Zero.

2353
03:08:38,124 --> 03:08:38,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

2354
03:08:38,644 --> 03:08:39,345
[SPEAKER_19]: Nice knowing you.

2355
03:08:39,425 --> 03:08:39,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye, Nico.

2356
03:08:39,665 --> 03:08:41,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Have fun staying in the castle.

2357
03:08:41,106 --> 03:08:41,526
[SPEAKER_19]: Take care.

2358
03:08:42,007 --> 03:09:01,441
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, tonight's post-show, we're going to start it off with that Air remix, and then after the Air remix, we're going to go into that Now Dance 2004 compilation from Britain, because it's neat, and lots of good songs in it, including some Kylie Minogue, some Ian Van Dahl, and some other artists you may know from Bomani releases.

2359
03:09:02,081 --> 03:09:02,441
[SPEAKER_19]: Enjoy.

2360
03:09:02,501 --> 03:09:03,042
[SPEAKER_19]: Have a great night.

2361
03:10:49,123 --> 03:11:14,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty Green Eyes It's full of sparkle and such light And let me remind That you chose not to cry But it's alright For your lover has come home By your side alone with me You'll never ever be alone
