Orange Lounge Radio Live is now on the air.
Orange Lounge Radio Live is a live talk program dedicated to all things Bomani and Bensum.
Orange Lounge Radio may contain adult content, but you probably shouldn't let your children
listen.
If you do let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio, they may turn into evil little
demons from hell!
Oh wait, most children already are evil little demons from hell.
Now you see that evil will always triumph, because good is dumb.
Fact, drunk and stupid is no way to go flex up.

Hey, did you hear about that show?
What show?
Well, they play a lot of grace and money and video of each game music, but if you listen
to it, you have to listen to it again within seven days.
Oh, I've heard of that station.
Really?
Yeah, I even listened to it a couple weeks ago.
Hey, what happens to you if you don't listen to it again?
Well, you die.
I what?
Hey! Wait!
What's this crazy bitch doing coming out of my computer screen?
Aaaaaah.

Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
Episode number seventy.
Yo.
If you wanna join our chat room, head on over to www.calibomani.com.
Click on Orange Lounge and click on Chat.
And he tells me it's good, and I believe my friends usually.
Do you believe everything everyone tells you?
Yes.
You know, Rob, I have some, uh, swampland I could sell you in Arizona.
What?
You have one?
I have some swampland I could sell you in Arizona.
Really?
Is it by the beach?
Yeah.
Oh, cool.
Um, anyway.
They have white gauges in their shivers too.
Of course the chat room's going, of course Rob doesn't eat fish, he's a fag, ha ha ha ha.
funny. That joke was funny maybe ten years ago?
Was that from the page of the 23rd? Yeah. Of course. Where else? Anyway, let's get
into that big surprise I was talking about earlier. Yes, Zero has brought over his sex
box and with that comes DDR UltraMix, which I have not seen at all yet and I think a lot
plugging component cables into a RCA system.
Yeah.
Basically the way that the screen looks is kind of built up as if you're looking at a concert stage.
It's got like a whole little set of ratchery type things on the side.
And on the opening screen it has like spotlights on the top and it's mostly really bright white.
And out of all of those EDR games it has the coolest menu music.
Yeah.
Agree so far just with the menus and everything. I've been incredibly impressed so yeah, I'm sorry Jamie
Yeah, it does I'm kind of surprised okay
I want to see I have heard that do that thing has a really scandalous gay video
Yeah, you know I want to see it. We figured that you would like this video
I must do that thing so if we could play do that thing, please
And then you guys can hear this, too.
This is a funny song.
I think we're okay. I'll just...
Oh, you better watch the video.
Oh. Yeah!
Okay, there's like... Wow.
This is the gayest video I've ever seen in my life. There's like women in fur and half-naked men.
these two chicks are standing in front of a microphone that says the name of their band
the size it's very britney spears to me they look like britney spears clones i guess it's
girls
oh my god they're not wearing pants that's awesome
god damn it why can't this be in color
Ready Steady Go by Paul Oakenfold
kostjamrh ready steady go by Paul Kvoltz
But they got all the elements of the song, like perfect, and what I'm really impressed
of is the fact that almost all the songs, like the license lines, they all have really
p0k3smot42o
Strictly the motherfucker
Strictly the motherfucker
Ready, steady, go
All right, that was Ready Steady Go by Paul Ogenfold.
We're playing DDR UltraMix here on Orange Laundry Radio.
No webcam tonight, guys, sorry.
We haven't been able to get it working again since the computer upgrade.
And we can't hook UltraMix directly into our video card either, because we don't have that either.
They also have a cool song that, of course, most people know it, Castles in the Sky.
Yeah, Castles in the Sky, most people know that song already.
They did a really good job with the stuff for that too.
Let's hear one of the remixes. I'd like to play one of the new remixes for everybody.
The two remixes that are on here right now...
What are the unlocks so far? What have you unlocked?
The unlocks that I've gotten so far are the Metal Gear Solid song from Beatania.
Oh, this is Keep Your Body Movin' by Thuggy D.
The cool thing about this Thuggy D guy is the fact that he remixed Absolute and Insertion.
I think most people are pretty convinced that this is just Scotty D from Drop the Bomb.
It's actually not really yeah
Yeah, they have a link on the internet to where you can go and get his group information.
This is very interesting, it's um, I haven't heard a DDR song about DDR in a long time.
Really, I thought this was probably the worst song on the whole night.
Yeah, this is definitely like an old stupid media song.
It's interesting, I'll give it that.
I also unlocked one of the Incident Prayers.
Somebody had told me that Santa Milette, the BLT style, is in the MOC, actually.
No, it's just already in there. It's out of the MOC.
Oh, the remixed Santa Milette, the new one.
I haven't heard that yet.
Well, it's not new if you play 4 style, but...
p0k3smot42o
kostjamrh
morsdraconis
kostjamrh
Here's your typical slowdown that you're used to in the normal insertion.
kostjamrh No speed up at the end.
I mean, I just wonder if they do make another one for the Xbox. If they do, um, from what I understand, this is just more of a promised catch, to bring one to it.
What? Oh, yeah, it's more of a dance meeting.
Yeah, I mean, if they do, for the fact, make a new one, I wonder if he's gonna be back doing more stuff. If he's gonna turn into, you know, a Scotty D, or...
We'll see.
All right, let's pull the plug on UltraMix for now.
God, no, turn off the love to me, Jesus.
All right.
Yeah, we'll play that one.
Maybe later in the show we'll get to the Metal Gear 1 and the shiny disco balls.
Some people want to hear that too.
Anyway, Ryan, you've been playing this more than anybody else here really.
Being a DDR fan, what did you think of UltraMix?
and compare it to Max 2 for PlayStation 2?
Well, I mean, you can kind of compare it as out of the box that Max 2 would be better.
But a lot of the redeeming qualities to the Xbox One is the fact that out of the box
it's got a couple good remixes and it has a couple new songs that you haven't heard.
And on top of that, it's more of a party game now for the fact that you can have
four people playing in your house at the same time, which we actually tested around a little
bit last night, and it's pretty fun because it gets pretty competitive. On top of that,
of course, you have the Xbox Live stuff where you can get on there and play up to four people
at once, transferring edits back and forth and stuff like that. I managed to play against
one guy with an edit he had. And seriously, a lot of these people who made edits are really,
really bad. It almost makes a lot of the Tournaments 4 stuff look good. I mean, it's that sad.
About the Xbox Live, though, can you talk to them while you're playing?
Yeah. When you buy an Xbox Live with the DDR pad, if you look in the front of the DDR pad,
it has a part where you can hook your communicator in, and they give you like a six...
Oh, so it's hooked to the pad?
Yeah. And you can put a memory card in there, too.
Oh.
the cool thing is they give you a six foot extension for your headset. It only goes down
about three feet. You can get a longer extension for it so you can talk while you're dancing.
It goes into the controller port. Yeah. And another good thing too that I was really impressed
with was the actual pad that comes with it if you buy it. I know a lot of people say,
oh, we have really good anti-slip stuff. That pad on the Xbox, I got a running start about
10 feet away, jumped up on it, and it didn't move anywhere. I was able to play stuff like
Sugaru really, really well, double-aided. So, I mean, there's no problem with the pad.
It's all a really, really good thing all around. And plus, the online stuff, you're gonna be
able to download new characters, you're gonna be able to download new songs. And if they
keep going at the rate they are with the new songs they've released onto the game itself,
and they have those really good steps like that with the exception of a couple
it's going to prove to be a very good
one of my buddies had said he was playing the uh... ddr xbox online
he was playing through xbox live
and he was playing some guy
when challenging him and then at the end he beat this guy and he heard over the
microphone
like he heard a kind of distance
man this guy just beat me
yeah he says this xbox live thing really makes
Do you hear some of that chatter online is really funny?
Except for the delay.
Have you tried buying the new songs yet? I hear that you can buy five new songs for five bucks right now on Xbox Live.
Yeah, you can. I actually haven't had a chance to do it yet, because my Cat5 cable is not long enough to reach my Xboxes, so I gotta do it somewhere.
I might do it tonight before I leave here.
Oh.
Or maybe I can do it by the end of the show, since we have a spare cable.
That'd be interesting, yeah. Actually, we have a spare cable. Maybe we could buy the songs.
That'd be interesting.
I can do it with no problem. I have all set up to do it.
Alright.
So we'll see what comes out. I don't know if they're selling characters yet, though.
kostjamrh In My Eyes is in it and Mind Parasite
kostjamrh I heard from what they are going to try to do is throw as much extreme stuff
kostjamrh I had also heard that Santa Marte, the BLT style from 4 styles, is in there too, so that would be a fun unlock.
kostjamrh The problem with the unlocks on here, and it's not even so much as a problem, it's like, after you play one song, which anyone who plays this probably won't mind knowing, the Metal Gear song from Beatmania is the first song you unlock.
You unlocked Santa, if I remember correctly, by I think double A-ing or passing Santa on all difficulties.
Really?
Yeah, I'll have to try that.
I also know that there's some, there is supposedly an unlock everything code, like how 2DX had, you know, what if you got like, what was it, 573 or something like that, it would unlock everything.
everything. They're supposedly something like that on the Xbox, though I'm not sure exactly
how they plan on having it done. I wouldn't say UltraMix is better than the Extreme Japanese
yet, because it doesn't have as many songs. Out of the box, it's got like 38 songs, and
you can only unlock like 9 more, which that's the real assy part about it. You know what,
But though it's all credit for Ultramix, it's great because it's new.
They've made old stuff look really new.
They've kind of redone the interface, and like you said, the stage select music is awesome.
They have some innovative new modes with the whole live play and the four player thing.
They've really taken steps in the right direction.
I've got to totally credit Konami of Hawaii for making an interesting DDR mix.
I suppose also there's a mode with the arrows where if you step on a certain arrow, it gives
more life tier, life bar or something like that too.
Yeah, it's supposedly one of the unlockable modes. There's supposed to be two new unlockable
modes. Wow.
I just don't know about it yet. But yeah, I mean, this mix all together is shaping up
to be really good, if they keep up on those downloads. I mean, it's really cool if they
do have five new songs, but what I don't want to see is they go, you know, maybe a few weeks,
because it's supposed to be like every two weeks I think they're going to do that, or
once a month and what will be stupid is if they drop it after two months and they never
do it because I don't think they will for the fact they can make the money but you know
it's happened with stuff like that before.
Let's see the unlockables. They've got of course the Metal Gear Solid 2 Mission R by
LED from BeatMania. That's to unlock that you get any grade of an A on any song. Grade
Radio 6 Cyber by Taka, that's another unlock, AA any song. Put Your Faith in Me Saturday
Night Mix, quit a song. I quit it because my phone rang. And Paranoia Rebirth, get a
C or higher up for Paranoia Eternal on all three difficulties. Colors for Extreme, play
a lot of songs. It starts getting like that. Healing Vision and Angelic Mix, get a C or
higher for Healing Vision on all three difficulties. Santa Mora, whatever, the BLT style for Santa
is, yeah, C or higher for any Santa song, or for Santa on all three difficulties. Max
300, double, triple A any song, or pass it on roulette, and Orion 78 Civilization Mix
Beat Challenge Mode. So those are all the unlocks. I mean, that's, that's good unlock
stuff though right there. Just, I'm just curious to see what they're gonna sell. If they sell
any of the other Macs or anything. I still don't like the idea of unlocking old songs
but since this is Xbox's first mix we'll let it slide and the fact that there is some really
good stuff that you do unlock in there. There's the one concern though is that how people
are gonna cheat the system. And the only, I think that people are gonna find a way to
do it though to copy them not that I would encourage it you know I would
expect for people to download well yeah like with the like what we do for
Phantasy Star with the with the game shark and a laptop that's all you um but
um you know I just I'd like to encourage you know for anyone who's listening who
has the game or plans on getting it for the Xbox go ahead and buy your downloads
Don't try to cheat the system, in this case.
Yeah, because then they'll make new DDRs and blah blah blah, everybody's happy.
For the simple case, if you're buying the Xbox version, obviously you're buying it so you can play online and so you can download new songs.
kostjamrh And DDR will be dead and it will be all your fault!
Way out there statement I'm going to get my butt kicked for, but maybe if DDR is successful
enough on the Xbox, Microsoft will have the balls to tell them to bring 2DX over here.
Because that could be something that could make a lot of people interested in an Xbox
really fast.
Okay, here's the thing. If they're going to do something like that, they have to make
the key presses and stuff and the songs and everything as good as they have done on some
of these with the steps and the song choices. As long as they do that, I would have no problem
buying it. But if it comes to the point where they're going to release another crappy ass
US mix, I will refuse to buy it or even play it. And it's just going to get that bad.
Rumor is, now take this with a grain of salt, rumor is apparently this is published in some
Konami newsletter in Japan this week. 7th Style is on its way, 80 songs. So we'll see.
Happy. We don't know any details yet, but we will
keep our eyes posted. Well, you know what I was thinking that it
it could be possible for them to do especially on Xbox, keyboard mania. There is a US keyboard
mania released for PC. Yeah, I remember we talked about it on one show here and information
was scarce as it is, so it was a really under promoted thing. I mean just think about it,
if it's on the PC it can go on the Xbox no problem. Right. So, perhaps they might decide
might decide to try that one. It'd be, you know, the way keyboard mania was, you know,
a very small market, but bring it out, put enough of a price tag on it, and they'll make
their money back.
I know. If there was enough interest to keep that PC one alive when we barely know anything
about it, and, you know, some people actually consider our station a source of news, shock,
we barely know anything about it. I don't know how this keyboard mania's thing's making
its money on PC, but...
One last thing about the UltraMix that's kind of cool is if you have a metal pad for the
PlayStation 2, you can go to Fry's or whatever your main heavy hitter electronics store is
and buy a little $20 adapter and you can use it on the Xbox because it actually does work
because it's mapped out to the buttons.
So you can actually use your metal pads or even if you don't want to spend the money
on a new Microsoft pad and you have PlayStation 1s laying all around, spend $21.74 and go
and buy an adapter and you can play all your games. And it's really worth it for the fact
that, I mean, some people also don't like the Xbox controller for pretty much anything
or fighting games and stuff. You can always use your PlayStation controller too. It's
worth using.
Okay, you guys want to take a break or you want to just go into some how was your week,
how was your day?
Because I know we've got a lot to talk about here.
Alright, well, Jamie, you were gone for some time here, so...
Two whole weeks.
Two whole weeks.
That's a long time, you know.
Well, how was your month?
How was your day?
Well, Ma and John went with me to Alabama, and we stayed at my grandmother's place.
And basically it was a lot of running around in my grandma's car and finding people and
seeing old friends and visiting and doing some gaming which made me happy because I
haven't done any gaming since the last time I was in Alabama.
Got to see a lot of people I really missed.
We watched so many movies while I was there.
Finally saw The Ring, finally, multiple times while I was there.
And then we rented Ringu, and it was okay, but I liked the ring.
And then we saw Scary Movie 3 and Kill Bill again, and the third Matrix movie, which was
heh, which everything in that movie happened exactly how I expected it to, except for the
very end, which I'm not going to spoil for anybody.
I haven't seen it yet.
I'm not answering any questions on that.
He turns into a bunny.
Yeah, he turns into a bunny and scampers off into the sunset.
And you thought all those, how far does the rabbit hole thing go, was all just like, you
know, metaphors.
Uh-uh.
He was, he was going on a skateboard in a little, you know, vest with a pocket watch
going, I'm late.
It was fighting Smith, and then all of a sudden, the wild stallions come in.
Yeah, all of a sudden, Alex Schwinner shows up like, dude, we're in the wrong movie.
Kill me now.
Anyway, I really wanted to go to the French Quarter while I was there, but I didn't get
to.
We just...
Pout.
I got into New Orleans, drove back, although we did eat at a really nice buffet at the
Beaux Ravages in Biloxi, and it was free.
And let's see, I played DDR at cyber station in my build.
The dance maniacs machine was gone and that made me cry.
Really?
Yeah, but the DDR machine there was kind of crap, so I twisted my knee playing on that
machine.
I hadn't played any DDR for a month because of that nasty sinus infection I had.
I'd never got a chance to go find the BeatMania machine.
I found out where it is.
It was at the mall.
I used to work at it, Springdale Mall, and they're renovating the mall.
They're rebuilding the whole center of it, so they moved the machine actually to a little,
I think it's like a network gaming place slash arcade, but it's over for anyone who lives
in that area who might be listening to the show. It's on Moffitt Road by University.
Just this little sort of hole-in-the-wall gaming place. But I didn't get a chance to
go.
I have an on-topic question.
Ah.
What is up with those networking gaming places? I've seen them popping up everywhere lately,
like here in Sacramento where Orange Island is based. I've seen at least three brand new
network gaming places in the area.
There was one that we passed on the way up here.
What did... Are they really that popular? I've never been to one in my life.
They're gonna go the way of the dot com business.
I completely forgot where I was, thank you very much.
You were playing DDR in the BeatMania machine?
Yeah, and I never got to play the BeatMania machine, so, but it's a, what I had been told
it was a 6th mix and I wanted to play it.
I took my mom out to dinner for her birthday at the original Oyster House, which is like
the best seafood place in the universe.
All the seafood that they cook there is all locally caught stuff.
This is really yummy, fresh catfish and all kinds of food.
Better than red lobster?
Red lobster, okay, red lobster is good, but nothing beats fish caught in the Gulf.
And I have to say this, you eat seafood out here, all the West Coast seafood does not
taste as good as seafood caught on the East Coast, I'm sorry, it does not.
It has this sort of weird flavor to it.
Real seafood is in the south.
And I got to eat fried okra, which made me happy, because nobody out here knows how to
cook fried okra, right?
Because they make it all slimy and icky.
I ate the Cracker Barrel.
It made me sick, because I'm not used to country cooking anymore, but it was pretty good.
I enjoyed it.
We ran into lots of movies, like I said.
I got to see Undercover Brother, that was like the funniest movie ever.
Not really much else happened.
Oh yeah, we went to Walmart a lot.
Super Walmart.
There's two of them.
I was so happy because I love Super Walmart.
Now I've heard that associated with the South before.
Well, they can't have Super Walmart out here.
There's like one, and it's in, what, Chico?
They're going to open a Super Walmart in Chico.
But Chico is, you know, just like most rural parts of the nation, so...
Well, maybe it's hardly rural.
I know, but...
I don't know how to put it. Forget it.
But, um...
Maybe it's this college town thing, I don't know.
Maybe.
But, um, the, uh...
We went there, like, practically every night.
It's like, we're bored, let's go to Walmart.
So...
Ah, it reminds me of college.
When I was going to school, it was Walmart or Bruno's the grocery store to go get liquor, but I'm sorry
I got my transcripts from school. Yay second go back to school. This is me off
I ordered two copies of my transcripts, you know two sealed copies
So if I go to one school or want to go to the other I can have both of those copies
They only sent me one of them. So I have to call them and bitch and fuss and moan
complain complain
The flight back was bumpy.
We went through this torrent right before we got into New Orleans and then there was
an accident and it was all kind of crappy, but our flights left within five minutes of
each other.
We had everything timed so well, you know, when our flights were leaving and everything.
The ride to Denver was bumpy, the flight to Sacramento was pretty smooth, and then I got
in town and was like, hey, it's cold.
By the way, Mobile has the most bipolar weather ever.
It's like, I'm hot, I'm cold.
I'm hot, I'm cold.
I'm hot, I'm cold.
It's like menopause or something.
Anyway, it was really kind of warm.
Of course, it was humid the whole time, but around Thursday-ish, it got really cold, like
in the 50s or so.
It was cold weather, and then Monday, hi, I'm hot.
It's 80.
look, the sun's out and people drive really slow there. I came back feeling really happy.
That's the best place anyone can go for a vacation because it's relaxing. No one's going
to rush you or anything. People are polite. California sucks. I mean, there's more to
here. But I think the vast majority of people out here just suck. I said vast majority,
not everybody. Of course, the people that I associate with that I consider my friends
are in the non-suck portion of the community. Well, okay.
But most everybody else. There's not as many polite people. No one's going to smile at
you when you walk down the road, or nod their head high, or hold a door for you, or be considerate.
you know people are too much in our hurry I smile at other people like when
I've gotten a raise and they probably look at you like you just escaped from the asylum like when
I've gotten a raise at work or something it just you never see the difference
until you've been away from it for so long that it was just I don't know it was
sort of almost disappointing to come back almost disappointing but I mean
And this is, of course, where my home is, and I couldn't imagine living anywhere else.
But still, it was just...
I found myself getting homesick right when I got off the plane, so it was really weird.
And as for my day, I got back and decided to try the test server for Ragnarok.
So I'm on the Sacre server, enjoying it.
I'm supposed to be finishing up the last chapter of my fanfic, but I've only barely started
it.
and
you know work was work. One good thing though I found
I realized once I counted everything up I only work six
days this entire month. But you get paid for it all right?
Oh hell yeah. Right on. Because we got two holidays this month
my vacation and plus we get two days off for Thanksgiving
so it works out cool for me.
Anything else? I am glad to be back don't get me wrong. Welcome back.
I am glad to be back.
So I ended up playing some Guitar Freaks and some Fourth Plus and No Extreme and a little
bit of F Zero.
And earlier this week I was still sitting on my computer getting it all working fine.
I'm kind of in the process right now of getting my copies of certain programs that I don't
owned, put them on my computer, you know, so I was busy downloading my updated software
and all that. And I got a few other games I need to try out, like I just got Simpsons
Hit and Run, which looks pretty good, and then Celebrity Deathmatch, which looks kind
of fun. And then Midnight Club 2 didn't work for me. For some reason, the image that it
wanted me to burn was larger than the CD I have, so, that sucked. And then, what else?
I've been working on a list of something for a secret something that I'll be, you know,
doing later. I can't really say right now because I just can't. It's not close to completion
yet. But, on this list right now, there's a good, oh, over 600 things on this list,
so it's a long list that I need to work on. Anyways, so I've been doing that, and I was
going to work on the web page for Orange Lounge, but I never got around to it, and yeah. And
also, yeah, I don't know. My show's in limbo right now, too, so. I don't know. It's been
like that, kind of like a whole week to spend in limbo. That's pretty much it.
Alright, yeah, more programming notes to come after the next break. There's some important
programming notes that we'll need to get out of the way and take care of. My week and my
day was okay. I really didn't do anything too exciting this week. Monday night I took
Magus and Angel home, so they know Sky was on Wednesday instead, and that was good. Oh,
on the way to take Magus and Angel home, we stopped for Boba in Davis, and they have this
awesome new flavor which is this coffee toffee flavor it's great
uh... so there was that and then uh... friday
uh... i went out to spike and mike sick and twisted festival of animation over
downtown
and that's the third year in a row i've gone and there's uh... some pretty funny
shit this year
uh... namely the ninjus was funny
and uh...
well so that was good
something about this giant stick figure that was a condom that was pretty good
happy tree friends as always was winner
But the best, by far, was here comes Dr. Tran.
Fucking hilarious.
If you want to visit www.beyondgrandpa.com and get all the information on oh shit it's
Dr. Tran, it's great and would be well worth your visit.
So that was fun.
And then yesterday I hung out with Jamie for a while where we worked on a couple of the
new promos you'll be hearing and got to see my buddy Eddie, who's in from out of town,
They made some home movies, not those kind of movies, and that was about it.
And then today was okay.
I woke up really late and then the power went out and that sucked.
And then I hurried up and worked on the new intro and I was going to go out and meet Pixie
Dust and no Stylin, but I didn't because Jamie was cooking, I remembered, so I didn't go
out to meet them.
And my eyes started hurting, which kind of sucked, but I took Tylenol and it's better
now.
I didn't catch whatever lanky style had because he had an eye infection the other day, but
I don't think it was pink eye though.
It was just something where the eyes were like really, really hurting.
I don't know, but I think I'm okay because I took Tylenol and I feel better.
So maybe it was just psychological.
I don't know.
So that was pretty much my week and my day.
Anyway, Zero or Miko, you guys have anything you want to share about your week and your
day?
the show
you talk into the microphone you just say hi people and
this is what's good and this is what sucks whatever
yes it is on
if you don't talk they'll make me sing
please talk
no
low-key does not saying we bring that out on special occasions and rating
stunts only
would you do yesterday
i can't remember
did you go to the offline at all this week
uh... yeah
to play anything interesting later
uh...
tdr extreme
right on
what uh... what
what was like
kostjamrh What was the last big song you passed in ddr extreme?
nico looks like a poor deer in the headlights right now with a microphone in her hand
they can hear me? can they?
i could pass cartoon heroes when ddr extreme first came out too
and then i didn't go for playing for a long time and i got fat and older and then i couldn't beat it
but i can beat it again
kostjamrh What do you think of Ultramix?
kostjamrh What do you think of Ultramix?
p0k3smot42o
Okay.
And Rancho.
Okay.
Is that the one that says Dunkin' Donuts, too?
I guess not.
Forget it.
No, but we have the coffee by Dunkin' Donuts.
All right.
Good enough.
And what's the third one, if you're willing to share?
And I work at my school.
All right.
Yeah.
Hooray for school.
pay for school
that's why i like going to school is because i get paid
all right right on
okay so uh...
let's hear from zero we haven't heard from zero yet how uh... how was your week in your day
mister zero
no it was okay my week. You have your lower lip sticking out like you're pouty about something
i had to spend like every dime i had on my piece of shit
fucking car
You know, I only paid $100 for that car, so I wouldn't feel so bad if I set it in a nice,
happy roll and then jumped out and let it crash into a wall or incoming traffic.
It's...
God, my door doesn't shut!
So I had to tie it with a shoestring.
You tellin' me it's ghetto!
I know my car's ghetto.
It's not easy to fix, it's just I don't have the $50 for the stuff that I need to fix it.
I'm kind of pissed off for the fact that it says that the song pack 1 for Ultramix is
released and yet they won't update their fucking sites to tell you what's out.
There's a lot of stuff that Xbox Live is screwing up on right now.
Somebody had showed me a site that had the X... I thought it was an Xbox site.
No, I know it tells... No, it's not... I'll tell you right now it's not Xbox because I'm
on it. They're just totally making it look like crap.
They're still stuck in October now.
I would know anything about websites that never update. I've never heard of this.
Of course you haven't.
No, never. No, not at all.
Just like my live journal that never updates. But anyways,
so uh...
there's that, and
of course I got UltraMix, so I had a lot of fun with that.
Also, I started playing a little bit of uh... I think you need an UltraMix party.
I was thinking about it. I just gotta figure out how to plan it and when to.
I mean, I know how to plan it, I just don't know when.
p0k3smot42o I think I need to finish my cabinet
kostjamrh And she cooked us dinner tonight, so do launder here all you want. Bring fish and you can, uh...
kostjamrh Now I know why we couldn't download anything. I'm looking at their service status, and it says that it's down.
kostjamrh Huh, that sucks.
kostjamrh And I bet you if I go back to it, it'll say that it's up, and then it'll say it's down.
kostjamrh But, um, no yeah, I want to get everybody together, just to come over and have another b-money party because I miss it.
parties are fun. And I'm sorry I missed your last one. I think I just was having my period.
I want to get everybody together just because we haven't done it in a long time and every
time we get together it's a lot of fun.
No idea.
We don't know a lot of these people in our chat room, they're just there.
They just started showing up.
They just started showing up and we haven't kicked them out yet, so.
They're our neighbors, you're friends.
No, we love all our new chatters, hello to all the new chatters.
I've seen some new faces pop up this past couple weeks, so it's exciting.
And our old chatters too.
and xbox lives up now one of the odds of that one
it's everywhere now
we're not just we're fucking big it's sad
uh... anything else you want to share about your week and your day
i managed to make it here today
congratulations that is an accomplishment honestly throughout this christmas season
i have no idea how many days i'm gonna be here
cuz it's
i work in the mall i mean
it's alright you know
Well, here's the thing is that I'm trying to get coming back here every week, now that I have a car and stuff, kinda, that walks really fast but doesn't run.
Um, once I get my, once I get this work schedule figured out, there'll be some nights hopefully I'll get here, either that or I'll just come here late, if anything, so...
Yeah, the mall closes at six, right? So you guys are out there by seven.
Extended hours now.
DOPE!
Yeah, so I mean, there's some people closing way late for no apparent reason.
kostjamrh You know who his boss is?
Yes, I know who his boss is.
And you think his boss would be sympathetic to the situation that there's this Orange
Lounge radio program, but no, that just makes him want to make him work more on Sunday nights.
Anyway.
I heard you're going to want TDX.
What?
You heard what?
What did you hear?
I heard that TDX is going to be at SunSplash.
Yeah, that's a rumor that always comes up, but we don't, I think they want to get it,
but maybe the people that actually buy the games don't.
Oh man.
Okay.
They were gonna get Derby Owners Club, that's before they found out it was gonna be $60,000
for a four-player cabinet, and they said fuck it because it's been out for a while and it's
not making the money it used to, and it would take like over a year to make the money back
on it.
So they said fuck it.
But they do have $120,000 to spend on arcade games for this coming year.
So it's a possibility. I honestly don't want it there, because I think it'll get fucked
up the same way that, you know, the one that Scandia does.
Speaking of which...
And I'd rather them, like, upgrade their complete mix too to beat me to the final, or even,
like, I don't know if it's a possible upgrade machine to a beat me to three the final or
something like that. But I'd rather them do that, because at least it gets some play out
of it and clean up the machine a bit and replace the coin door on it and stuff. But, what else?
Oh, they were, well, they're supposed to get another DDR machine there. I can't say. But,
there's a new, there's possibly a new DDR machine coming in there. It's Tori, it's from
scandia
No, it gets even better. They left the bass speakers on there because you can't really
get rid of them. It's like they went to Kmart and bought a $150 little mini stereo system
because there's two really shitty speakers on top, like the detachable ones off of a
boom box or something. They're sitting up there like, you can't hear it, of course.
I mean, it wouldn't even matter. They don't care anymore. I've actually heard them say
they don't care anymore. That was the, you know, the shift managers were saying that,
and also the main guy there doesn't care. They care more about that stupid fucking hick
shooter game than they care about anything else, because people have been blowing money
in their left and right.
That's what we need to be teaching the people in the ghetto, to shoot white people.
I would love to take the camera over to Scandi and get a picture of that ascii machine though.
It's their 2DX machine works.
And it's a miracle.
I've got some Scandi tokens I need to blow.
No, I think I want to actually call the owners.
I think I, you know...
Have a ball.
I have all the stuff to hook a recorder up to my telephone.
Record the conversation, put it on air, it'll be funny.
I'll do it.
Not if you said that you were recording at the beginning of the phone call.
That's why every time you call a customer service place, they say this call may be recorded.
You want to interview them for a local radio station?
I'll do it.
Why does your arcade suck so bad?
Nobody cares.
Why are you losing money?
They asked me that again the other day.
shift magic guy comes up. And this is the guy who's like, oh man, you should apply here
because it seems like you really care about the games. I'm like, no, thank you. But he's
like, why are all your friends not coming here anymore? I said, look at your DDR machine.
And he's like, what? And I said, it looks like my computer on top of some speakers.
There's no, there's nothing on there. And he said, yeah, well that's because the speakers
didn't work. I said, if the speakers didn't work, you don't have to take the whole top
off. And he's like, yeah, there's some other legal issues coming up. So how about this?
Keith went to RVGL.
Well no, it's not that. They said legal issues came up, so I wonder if someone ragged on them about having their extreme or something like that.
Oh please, that would be the first case I've ever heard of anywhere where somebody said something like that.
Well for the fact that they said legal issues makes me wonder what it was.
They're retarded, they don't know what the hell they're talking about.
Some stupid baby fell off the machine and now they have a lawsuit.
My kid was climbing the machine, fell down, and cracked his head open, so you need to, like, remove that so he doesn't climb.
Darwin, doesn't that work?
So, I don't know. I think Scandia is gonna-
The music coming from that machine is making my child gay!
You need to remove that machine! It's making people gay!
No. Last-
Why do we have to listen to all this jap music? We live in the United States of America, not Japan!
Keep your music to your own country! Thank you!
For the record, I love the artichoke dip from the heffalup bar.
Anyway, let's take a break, because we've gone like an hour now without a break.
So I think we need to take a break. When we come back, we're going to have...
I want to do a cage match first. We're going to do a cage match first?
Fine. We'll do a cage match first. We'll do that fuse later.
Cage match when we come back from this break with more just cornucopia of Bimani music.
back.
My emotions still remain
All my heart still yearns cause the fire still burns
I can't put out the pain
I would never, never assume to leave me with a mental wound
You know the reason why I cannot give and forget
You have left me not for life
Bitch, what's got like a night?
I can't forgive and forget
Can't forgive and forget
You've only got yourself to blame.
Baby, it's all live gold Baby, it's all live gold
She's the one I'd like to call, whoa Baby, it's all it does
Ride forever, can't wait until tomorrow
I want you baby, maybe tonight
I take you far away
I see you dancing
Shining like a jewel
Burning for love
In the golden light of love inside of
My pride, my heaven
Your precious fire for me
Baby, it's all in gold
Reaching out, I don't wanna let you go
Baby, it's all in gold
Baby it's all this gold, shine forever, can't wait till tomorrow
Baby it's all this gold, reaching out I don't wanna let you go
Baby it's all this gold, shine forever, can't wait till tomorrow
I need you, baby
What is it for you?
I think you have my feelings My hopes are far away, so please
He got a dream in his face He got a shadow of a dream
It's time to say goodbye to my face
I don't want you alone I pray you'll be happy
It's my time, I need to say that
That's the place for you
You don't have to let me get to be who you should be
That's the place for you
I can make it through, but I don't do it anymore
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of
the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.
Um, Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music & More program. Can we talk about that?
No subject will ever be taboo.
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights?
Except, of course, the subject that was just under discussion.
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?
I collect your fucking head.
Just like this fucker here.
What the fuck is going on here?
How's everybody doing?
I'm getting pissy because I can't find the cage match pick I want for tonight on my computer.
It's been on the whole time.
No, it's okay because it's muted. I can mute them here and then they don't go past my computer.
What's up?
Hi Rob.
Hi.
Rob.
Rob.
What?
Rob.
What?
Rob.
What?
So did you hear about last week's cage match?
Because I didn't have a song for you, we did a reverse cage match and we nominated four
songs to be booted off the station forever and did you know that Loki chose one of his
songs to be banned from the station forever.
What would I have a problem with that note?
The first song you can vote for tonight, I would say last week's winner, but it's actually two weeks ago's winner.
It's Battle Without an Honor or Humanity, the 88 Severed Limbs mix by the one and only
Loki.
Enjoy!
You only get to hear a clip of it because it did win last week, so we'll start it about
halfway in.
I failed all the rest, wanna raise the top ten
Stop lookin', I took you five to the right hand
Now I just need you to be the best of a black man
This wisdom wasn't made the way, so it's not planned
This hell is an actual terror
They make me move, they fight it up every day
So go and fuck it through them, they change it in like a modern parade
Don't combine, they say what the savage is, we're the only swine
This thing, there's only one spade
This body, I'm at the hop, I'm ready to sing him a song
I wanna run, come on, there may be no peace, no smoke
We don't need
The first song you can vote for tonight is Battle Without a Honor or Humanity, the 88-7
Limbs mix, so you can vote for that one, or you can vote for this next one, which is Jamie's
pick.
Hey, stop fighting about Para-Para.
We're trying to do a show here, hello.
Jamie, what song did you pick for tonight's Cade Mass?
I forgot. Something by Utah Saints.
Yes, it's FIFA 2001, actually.
I think it was done for FIFA 2001, but it's something else and I couldn't find the title again.
So we'll just call it FIFA 2001.
Okay.
Alright, so this is Jamie's pick for tonight's Cade Mass.
They say the title, and they end the song, though, somewhere.
Okay.
Something Hyperbeat or something.
Alright. Well, any particular reason you're picking this song?
Because I like Utah Saints, and we've never had one, so I picked one.
All right here it is second song you can vote for tonight Jamie's pick Utah Saints with FIFA 2001 enjoy

I like Utah Saints, it gets a 9.
p0k3smot42o I actually really did enjoy that song and I wish I would have heard it before now.
I think it was definitely a good song. I would give it an 8 or 9.
Okay. I had asked Mika what she thinks because she's on the phone, so she loses.
Alright, so there's song number 2 you can vote for tonight. Utah Saints with Power to the People?
Beats. Power to the Beats. Power to the People!
Alright. The song I wanted to pick for tonight's Cajun Match I couldn't find and that kind of pisses me off.
I think I wasn't really listening now. What do you think of it on scale one to ten?
I don't know. Can we listen to it again? No, we can't listen to it again.
No, it's a 1, by default.
Hey, my pick for tonight is from a new dance compilation out there.
It's Now Dance 2004 from Britain.
And this is Mel C, one of the Spice Girls, but that's okay, it's the Spice Girl that
can sing.
Baby Spice?
Sporty Spice.
The Daiki one.
Daiki Spice.
The one with the bad teeth?
Yes.
Oh.
They all have bad teeth.
They're British.
Just kidding.
This is the one that Did I Turn to You from DanceMania X8, which is a pretty popular song.
And this is a new single from her.

You're giving to yourself tonight, yet I'm not for sure

All right, that was Mel C with Yeah Yeah Yeah.
Jamie.
What?
Mel C, Yeah Yeah Yeah.
It was kind of repetitive and made me think of that Britney Spears song that's in Fifth
Mix.
So, no offense, but it gets like a 6.8.
Alright, Logie.
You know, this just goes to show you, you know, they can leave the Spice Girls, but they still suck.
I don't care if she dead, I turn to you, this is crap.
It gets a 3, because it's good.
It still sucks and it gets less than a zero.
It gets less than me.
No, that sucked. I never want to hear it again. It gets like a one.
That's it.
All right, Nico?
It's good. I give it a one.
What the hell is that?
Crack.
Jonas, hello, but you don't get to vote on that because you didn't get to vote on the others.
I'm sorry.
That's all right, but hello.
How are you?
All right.
Get ready to send your votes in over private message to Sky.
And here's the songs you can vote for tonight.
Here's a quick recap.
Song number one, Battle Without a Honor or Humanity,
the 88-several limb mix.
This is a battle without a humanity.
This is a battle without a humanity.
This is a battle without a humanity.
All right.
Song number two you can vote for tonight
is Utah Saints with FIFA 2001, the, what the hell's
name of it again?
Power to the Beats.
How are the beats? Thank you.
And song number three you can vote for tonight is Mel C with Yeah Yeah Yeah.
Alright, send those votes over private message now now now to Sky.
I'm in the chat room. Hello, how are you?
Wait, Jamie, before you get to the picture thing, because we're not ready for a break yet, I wanted to talk, because I know you wanted to talk about this earlier.
You picked up a new game this week, you passed up Ultramix to get your Eurobeat collection, but you did get a new game this week, right?
Final Fantasy X-2, not X.
Final Fantasy X-2.
Dear people, it's X, not X. Roll the numerals. Say it with me.
Ten-two.
Everybody?
X-2? Twelve?
Is it Final Fantasy X-2?
To piss Jamie off, I'll be calling it X2 all night long. X2? So what did you think of X2?
I don't know. That game doesn't exist.
What did you think of Final Fantasy XII?
You know, the posters for that game look pretty neat.
And the main character is hot.
And actually, yes, they do have pictures of the game up on the internet now.
So what did you think about Final Fantasy... I mean Charlie's Angels, the game.
That was just like... That was great.
I love the game. I'm having a great time with it. Although, my big disappointment came when
they brought in my man, because in the Japanese version, my favorite voice actor is his voice,
the guy with one leg. And his voice is okay in the US one, but I'm getting a Japanese
one coming up probably in a month or so, so I get to hear it later. But it's not bad.
The whole Al Bhed thing is back, you know, where you pick up the primer and everything,
but it doesn't really interfere with the game.
It's pretty neat so far.
I'm about, I think, up on the fourth, fifth mission.
I'm enjoying it, although you make sure that you have plenty of healing implements and
as much magic refill things as you can right at the beginning of the game, because it gets
pretty tough.
But the whole dress fear thing is pretty neat.
i'll probably pick it up and play through it because i play through ten and play through
all the other ones and
that's what i do
oh yeah
ah dark child says that at E3 they called it X2
they're idiots
just sayin'
one two three four five six seven eight nine X is not actually how it is
i don't know if there isn't make a man they're just uh... tailgating off the
uh... expert
i don't know you see cuz i would find that person
and shoot them in the head
access you know i really like final fantasy v i i i
it was really cool but
this one's okay to you i guess
i think everybody should get over it it's a game name
but uh... thanks to uh...
uh... to uh... link uh...
provided by, who did I get that from? From Nikari earlier. We've got an MP3 of the English
opening. Yes, and I have to... We're going to need to skip forward just a little bit
in the MP3 because... Well, I'm going to have to unpack it first, but we'll get to that
after everybody's review. We'll get to it after everybody's review, because I have to
unpack it first. Yeah, it's, you know what? They had another version of the intro, because
they translated the intro. The one that they were going to do, oh my God, they had the
worst singer ever. It sounded worse than the Busta Move 2 music. No, no, no, no, no. No,
they actually had an English speaking person doing the intro, the last person, and it really
sucked. Kotokumi was actually pretty good, her English one, but she put very odd pauses
in it and so it wouldn't have worked out. Too many people would have just been really
stupid over it and not liked it, even though her voice is absolutely awesome.
I like her voice better than the one they got, but the final person they settled with
though has a really nice voice and did the song justice, I thought.
But it's still the same intro for everyone who's seen the Japanese intro.
I'm probably pretty sure next week I'm going to have the song, Real Emotion, on our pre-show.
Yeah, so I got to see a little bit of 10-2 yesterday, and it's interesting. I really
liked how there's... I mean, this is to be expected when you have a direct sequel to
a Final Fantasy game, but a lot of the same areas. Like, you know, I was watching the
beginning of the game and there's a lot of Luca in it, and so it was kind of cool to
see like the same areas but like with these new kind of characters and
different things I don't know I'm easily amused I guess um but the gameplay
overall like it looks like they kept the same engine for everything outside the
battles and then totally redid the battle engine it's that all active
battle yeah it's all actually really fast and they have the dress shoes and
that's the first thing I noticed was my god the battles are fast paced Wow but
it's pretty cool I like that I like the idea of some fast paced battles on a
Final Fantasy game. The dresspheres are fine. But this is, yeah, between the dresspheres
and the whole just blatant Charlie Angel's theme, Charlie's Angels theme going on with
it, it is seriously, it's a cross between Final Fantasy and a Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen
shopping game. No! Do not insult the game with that. And then, you know, you go to these
towns, you're talking to people, it's like, you totally scored, like, 1,500 gills. You
up in the chest and says, you scored Phoenix down, you know.
And everything is awesomeness, awesome that. Oh my god, you were so awesome, you're throwing
up a level, babe. That particular scene where they're talking
about the awesome sphere. Girl, you know how to work that level.
It's just like that in the Japanese version. But I did notice some changes, like in the
I did notice some changes. There's, um, like, um, in the Japanese version, there's the Seagull
team and there's the Gullwings in the US one. That's like a little, you know, little changes
here and there. And then they got all the same voice actors.
Yeah, that was pretty cool. Don't get me wrong, just because I say it's a cross between Mary
Kay and Ashley Olsen game, I'm just, I'm poking fun at it. It really does look like a pretty
neat game. I wish I could have, like, played it a little more, but I'm too consumed with
11 to give a shit about any other Final Fantasy right now.
Addict. So, Ragnarok is cooler. Ragnarok is cooler.
Yeah, and I need to beat 10 first anyway, so. Yeah, Final Fantasy X-2, not too shabby.
It's kind of what you'd expect. It's definitely kind of made for the fanboys, although I don't
know, I would say it's a very great game. I should have brought it back with me.
But it's more for teenage girls and gay men, but that's okay.
Fanboys will love it too because, you know, I guess they're hot or whatever.
It definitely gives the fan service.
Yeah, it's definitely for the fans.
That's good because they need to sell a lot of copies to make up for how much money they
lost on the movie.
Well, you know, I really, though, I really think that the different job changed just
a little.
They have, like, set animations, like when you change into the singer.
She had the spotlight on her and the lights behind her and it dark, so it looks all dramatic.
Like when you change into the thief, she hops across the moon, there's a moon in the background
they hop across.
When you change into the sword fighter, you see their reflection in the sword.
And Yuna has Tidus' sword.
That was really cool.
Yeah, it's pretty neat.
But it's pretty cool.
It actually doesn't look like it ruins a whole lot.
I still haven't beaten Final Fantasy X, and it hasn't really ruined a whole lot, really.
I mean, you can kind of pick up something that must happen, but I'm kind of appreciative
that they didn't wreck the whole storyline to X with 10-2, you know what I mean?
Does that make sense at all?
It makes sense.
All right.
What do you think, Loki?
You got to see the game a little bit.
He's running away.
Have you got to play 10-2 at all, Zero?
What did you think of what you saw?
a little bit and what I saw, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it or not. It just
looked kind of girly to me, but I saw a couple of battle scenes and I thought they looked
really good, so I'm definitely going to be at some point picking it up. The strategy
guide is really cool, especially with the limited edition one with all the artwork and
stuff in it. Going by reading some of that strategy guide and seeing some of the stuff
I saw and from what other people have been telling me, I think that I actually will like
it because I really didn't like 10 too much because it just I don't know I just didn't
really get with the story but it looks like this one with its more fast paced action I
think I'll be able to keep up with it a lot more and enjoy it.
It really does feel though like you're coming in at the end of 10 because it's like what
you can do is already advanced in as far as where you can go and you get choices of different
missions you can take and it's pretty I enjoy the game okay you guys want to
know tonight's cage match winner all right let's unveil tonight's cage match
winner back to the cage match I've tallied up all the votes and and we have
a tie in tonight's cage match yay there's a tie in tonight's cage match
between Loki's pick battle without a honor or humanity the 88 severed
limbs mix
and between the Utah Saints song
whoops whoop that's not it
it's this one sorry there it is
So we have a tie, and in that case I get to break the tie, with a hammer. Sorry you can't
send in house votes, I'm on to you. So I get to break the tie vote. Oh wow, this is tricky.
There's a tie between the first and second songs tonight, and I get to break the tie.
And whereas, I think I do prefer Battle Without a Honor or Humanity, I didn't quite care for
what Loki had to say about my cage match pick, so I'm choosing Jamie's cage match pick.
Yay!
Oh no, now I have to make another song, oh no.
I would like to vote that that goes into permanent rotation.
Well, okay. Sure, why not, since we're all Kill Bill fans anyway.
Alright, so there we go. So you'll hear both of those songs in Orange
We're going to play that real emotion from Final Fantasy X-2 and something else in this
break.
Then when we come back, we'll do the FUs of the week.
We'll have to skip forward though a little bit.
So say this-
But why would we play both versions?
We have the Japanese shortened up one?
Okay, so we'll play both versions then, I guess.
So we're going to skip forward a little bit in this MP3, so pardon us while we navigate
this MP3 a little bit to find you the actual words.
So we'll hear both the English and Japanese versions of real emotion.
And we'll be back with the FUs of the week, so send those in over private messages to
the sky.
What can I do for you?
What can I do for you?
But I can't get in you
What can I do for you?
I'll be the hazy girl of my heart I can't wait for something like this
And now and then I don't know what to do I don't think that I can ever go back
To the things I've seen And those hazy dreams
Can you tell her what I'm sayin' now?
Hey.
You said it'd be a good thing,
Like a thing,
Like a thing.
So, I know,
The world up in the ocean has surrounded me.
I won't get into it now.
I know,
That 40's the only way my heart can go.
I hear your voice callin' out to me.
You'll never be alone
Can I get to you?
Can I get to you?
Can I get to you?
Can I get to you?
Yeah, I can hear you
And if I find the river that the moment has surrounded me
And I can't go on
I'll dance the moment that I close my eyes
I'll fall in love's happy heart
I'm dancing for all of you
I'll never be free
And so I know
The world of good emotion has to rise
I won't give in to it now
I know that moment is the only way
My heart can go
I hear your voice calling out
I can't hear you, you'll never be alone
Can I do for you? Can I do for you? Can I do for you?
I can't hear you
I can't hear you
What can I do for you?
This is the end of the video, if you want to see more videos like this, please subscribe to my channel.
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff
Do we want to be accepted by Hollywood?
No!
Do we care what people think of us?
No!
Do we want people to kiss our ass?
Yes!
Extreme Bimani Radio.
That's us.
Orange Lounge Radio.
Hi everybody.
We're back.
Both versions of a real motion back to back there.
and there's a third one out there too, Koda doing the English, but we don't have that currently.
We'll just have to play that later! Yep.
Anyway, it's about time to get into the FUs of the Week, but Jamie's not here just yet.
So, Loki, is there anything going on out there in the sim world you want to tell us about?
I guess. People are working on skins for, you know, the rest of the Bomani games like, you know, Extreme and stuff.
I hear Popping Music's in development for StepMania. Support for that. And, let's see,
what else? Oh, Keysound BMS files for 9th Style will be up on Vimeo later this week.
They promised it a few days ago, but they ran into some problems or something. So, those
will be up later on this week. So, you look for those. So, you can play 9th Style stuff
at home without all the lag. Also on supernova.org they've got the hard drive images for some
of the rest of the Beatmania games. Almost all of them are covered now. So if you have
the latest version of MAME you can play those as well. So go get those if you want to play
the actual arcade game of Beatmania. And yeah, there's other stuff but I can't mention the
other stuff too. But that's more local anyways. So, that's it. Oh, and I'm sure people are
going to be ripping Xbox stuff, but nothing yet. And as I mentioned last week, DDR Fever
stuff is available on DDRamerica.org or whatever it is, I can't remember. It's a DDR BitTorrent
site and you can download the craptastic songs that they have on there that's
about it okay well let's see I think we're about ready to get into the FUs
of the week so you want to send those over to me
Sky private message and try to limit yourselves on the FUs of the week I'm
getting several people who are writing me novels this week and forget it
i'm capping you guys after like three or four f us because it's too much
so um... and there's a lot of people sending them tonight so uh... send me
your best ones
uh... in the meantime
jamie what is the f u segment all about
when we're pissed off and tell everyone about it.
Um, my first F.U. of the week goes for people who are consistently negative and have
nothing positive to say.
Like someone who, um, never mind, I'm not naming names,
but someone who is uh... listening right now
now i'm not mentioning names
they know who they are
because trust me who always says
oh this sucks
that's not my style or
i don't like this or always negative always negative anyway
um...
and everyone goes through having to go back to work
although honestly when i went back to work we were having a
thanksgiving potluck it was pretty cool
and uh...
Of course, it's also no longer our busy season of the year, so we're really slow, so I've
got tons of time just to get stuff done and think.
Um, Effie goes to my cat for, uh, needing a bath, so I have to go wash my cat.
Um.
Oh, I just need to make sure that the pussy's clean.
Well, at least she's well-petted.
Anyway, another F.U. goes toward the upstairs room at my house for not being
cleaned so I have to clean that and I don't want to do that.
And then all the stupid people in California, which are most everybody.
Not everybody.
There's more people in this room I can say as an intelligent human being.
just everybody else though sucks and none of them can drive
and another one goes toward um... me for leaving my oregel at home because my tooth hurts
and then um...
I think that's about it. I'm really not full of angst today
oh yeah
ten-two
ten
ten
not x
oh yeah and the other one goes towards square
for closing the final fantasy 11 beta
right before i could install my beta copy
square enix
big f u to square enix
and then
a f u towards me not having more money
uh...
first one
well it's kind of minor
the first one was
if you define fancy eleven because i was watering into a two more didn't know
it's going to get jumped by two goblins
you know there's a real life or a kick the goblins ass without thinking about
it
but this is a game so i can't do that i mean i'm a rpg haha no i'm not a file
fancy i play file fancy i don't play
on my head that you're playing on
and online game
it's half of an online game it's half i fancy
and i'm only having had the rule
i'm not
you break half of it you break the whole thing
you don't understand i'm playing it leisurely
i'm not like i have to be on there all day cause i have to level up every day every day
oh my god if i'm not in this world like
most of my life
i don't know what i'm gonna do i dedicate
i dedicate the nelson laugh to you
uh... second f u goes to leaves
i don't like leaves
and the fact that every single leaf that's in this apartment complex
fell during one day
it's like it's snow outside but it's leaves
there's just like so many leaves out there it's kind of funny because the
mexicans were here the day before
blowing off the leaves like a few leaves that were there
and then a few years later every single leaf falls all at once
man i wish i could see their sad face when they come to work
next week
but i'll man
uh... also
uh... at the two
uh...
the parades that we had today
that mean that had been
yeah been
that's art
and
i really are much of at the the people are like this
they're talking about michael jackson and already
no victim of
no molesting his child
Here's my opinion on it, and you're going to listen to it anyways because I'm making you.
Basically, I think he's an easy target, and that they're just taking advantage of him because he's an easy target and a freak that sleeps with children.
Now, while he may be a freak that sleeps with children, does it mean that he's groping them?
So, you know, I just think he's just a freak, but I think he's innocent, and yet people are like,
I wouldn't let my kid next to that chum, Lester.
He's been convicted. He hasn't even gone to trial yet. You haven't heard any of the details yet.
It's just, it's annoying. But, I hate the media, because now they're talking about this instead of Kobe Bryant.
And then, you know, next thing you'll hear is, like, I don't know, uh, Bob Barker will have, like, chicken heads stapled to his walls.
kostjamrh And you know, if something like that happened,
Bob Barker would have a bunch of kittens and puppies killed all in his house, and then
he's talking about spandex and pets.
I just had a horrible thought, and Rod's probably going to hate me for this.
He's probably got the preserved corpse of Rod Roddy in the closet, so that he can open
it up. What would you do in this situation, Rod? What would you do?
I would sell it on eBay. Anyways, um, yeah, I'm done. Oh, F you to, um, Iron Chef for
not, like, last night we watched the, they tied, okay, so they had to go into an overcooked
round, and, um, they had, the first round was the potato match, which was awesome, because
I love potatoes, so I was watching that, and then the next round was sweet potatoes. I
was like, you know what'd be cool? Is if they put something in there that, like, no one
would want to cook, like kittens. They should have the kitten Iron Chef cook off. And it
would be great because they'd just be like all grossed out and stuff, but they'd have
to create awesome dishes using kittens. Live kittens. So that's it.
I don't know. I still want to see the live octopus one. Like from the intro.
Giant alien. No. All right, I'm done.
Dog, force me.
Rob.
Rob.
Well, you might try giving me a microphone. I'd love to give some F yous
I have a couple of use this week F you to the power going out earlier today
I fucking sucked and I thought I thought you know what though F you for not staying off longer
I wish it was still off right now
Then I would have had an excuse to just stay home and not do it
Sure, I could have just gone over to Jamie's, but I would have taken the easy way
I would have left me to do this by myself.
on it got voted out, but the show itself is still good, and next season is going to be
like the best television ever. So, um, you have to go to people that hate on reality
TV just because reality TV, because this show rules.
The only reason he's doing so well is all those two-year-olds watching the show. That
and, um, you know, the other show. Anyways, yeah, that sucked! Fucking A that he got voted
off, but, you know, that's alright, because, you know, vicariously through someone else,
he will have his revenge. You know what, I kind of view, a lot of people hate on it,
really hot guys like billy kidman he's hot
wrestling's okay it's just you know it's not my cup of tea but i don't hate on
wrestling just because wrestling is popular yet
people hate on survivor because survivor is popular so i'm saying f you
i don't watch wrestling because they don't wrestle against little kittens
god damn it i want to see the big people smash the kittens
is that so much to ask and to be honest i actually rather enjoy wrestling when
China's involved, except she's gone now, so I'm going to be a singer now.
And I like it when they get out the tables and the ladders.
That's always entertaining.
The teal and I like how the tables, ladders, ladders and chairs and cookie sheets.
I liked them.
I also liked how the one icon on Jamie's wrestling data
for some game was a little spinning ladder.
Yeah, on the news fight game.
That was cool. A ladder.
Yes, that rocked.
Anyway, let's hear from other folks in our room.
zer0, your FUs of the week
kostjamrh FU to Mortal Kombat 5 should have stopped at 3
kostjamrh But now they're doing Mortal Kombat 5 because they realized, oh, Deadly Alliance is kind of popular, maybe we should have put it in the arcade.
kostjamrh Yeah, which is absolutely ridiculous, because they should have stopped at the failure of 4.
kostjamrh Deadly Alliance was okay, I mean it was no Soul Calibur, but it was entertaining. It was more entertaining than a lot of fighting games I've played.
kostjamrh Fatalities are still cool.
kostjamrh Fatalities all sucked on Deadly Alliance.
kostjamrh They didn't even put like friendships or anything in there, because those were the funniest out of everything.
kostjamrh This is going to be great!
pikachu mix
Anyways, anyways, um, and the F-U-2 didn't have my right arm injured, in a way.
I'll show the videos later.
And, basically not many F-Us, except for people emailing me about the upcoming tournament I'm trying to organize for April, which I have no place at yet.
People saying, when is it going to be coming over? It's coming soon.
kostjamrh And people are issuing about bar raping vs no bar raping on PA
All the Final Fantasy, etcetera, etcetera, and especially the new upcoming movie of Final Fantasy Children Advent.
I already know, you know what, as much as I love Final Fantasy VII, I'm already convinced this movie is going to be a huge disappointment, so...
I'm not looking forward to it.
I've always seen, like, the spirits within, but all I do is throw fanboy shit, like,
p0k3smot42o
the week
not really
okay
then lets get on to our chair of F.U. shall we
Jamie would you like to enter an F.U. on behalf of Miko
F.U. to not having an F.U.
alright
moving on
what is up with this Mary Kay and Ashley DVD
moving on
Zodiac Knight would like to give an F.U. of the week to Squeenix
An FU of the week to Squeenix for using a sucky version of Real Emotion as the X2 opening song.
Okay, that version did not suck.
DarkHatsui would like to say,
F you to this cold that still hasn't gone away.
Jason would like to say,
F you to cable one while I'm happy that I can have cable.
It's really stupid that me and my friend are separated by four houses and one street
and that he can't get cable.
Hurry the hell up.
Uh, fuck you, boss, name withheld, for calling me fat.
I haven't gained a pound in quite a while.
Jason would also like to say fuck myself for not listening in a while and not having a reason not to listen
Yes, I'm the permissible fired
You have a microphone oh the other ferret
Where the hell did it go?
Well, then it's your fault for throwing it at me, isn't it? Oh
Here it is
Don't throw it again. All right. Yeah, if you Jason shame on you for not listening
DJ dark knight would like to say f you to the game attendance at my local putt-putt
We're not fixing the 2dx and initial d machines because the 2dx machines
Still have the black void on the top of the screen and can't watch the videos and the initial d machine for not fixing the two
Player side wheel because of that I lost a match racing Friday night
Alright, here's a suggestion. Stop playing Initial D.
Hey! Here's a suggestion. Get a JPS 2 and play it at home.
Play Initial D at home like I do.
Darkchild
DD Archaholic, I don't know. I think it's Darkchild sending most of these FUs but they keep
switching their name back and forth. Darkchild likes to say FU to people who call
others stupid for saying things differently than they do. FU to
people who act one way and bitch at others for doing it themselves. F U to the cat shit
smell creeping in on me and F U to Polar Boy of Game Stop Arden, whatever that means. S
Ghost would like to say, F U to my job for being bipolar. Last week they scheduled me
less than 10 hours and this week they scheduled me 30 plus before schedule changes. My boss
and his wife are morons, they should learn how to schedule before starting a business.
F you to my dreams. I'm sick of being a secret service member for a bag of salad.
What?
I'm sick of being a secret service member for a bag of salad.
Okay.
Oddly enough I always die at the end. I think Freud would have a field day with me.
F you to anyone who thinks I'm a pervert now. I was making a reference to an earlier statement like
that tits equal veto power. I'm not sexist and I'm sorry if anyone thought I was.
But, but, but, but they do.
FU to my clothes washer having an electrical fire leaving my clothes soaking in water
FU to this freaking wait for Phantasy Star Online Episode 3
FU to everyone who can't time attack on Phantasy Star Online Challenge Mode
I quit P.S.O.
would like to say F you to people who accuse me of cheating on ultra mix it's
not my fault that you can't be as great as an arrow-smashing fairy as I am from
one arrow-smashing fairy to another you show them who's boss DJ Specter would
like to say F you to my Spanish teacher F you to Sam's Club for not having the
digital camera they supposedly had F you to school and F you to optical illusions
and that's for minst would like to say fu to teen night at the ddr place by my house
home from college for break and i forgot they did that on fridays the place was filled with
various small children acting even more stupid than usual minst would also like to say fu
to people who angst over initial d i've seen it for the first time and it's not a pretty
sight oh yes an fu to being on dial-up for 10 days and fu to the people in the general
area where I live, as for some reason they've decided it's now popular to golf, almost like
five years ago.
Anyway.
That's like early 80s.
I know.
Angel would like to say, I can't give you my FU as much as I'd like to, but here we
go.
I don't, I don't.
Oh, she's trying to omit names and stuff.
FU to friends hanging out with enemies and expecting me to be cool with it.
Stop trying to think that I'm friends with you still.
I'm over it.
I slept at around 4 a.m. and forced myself to wake up around 6 a.m. to take my cousin to school.
F.U. to name-changing in some of the games and anime in general. I know there are some good name-changes,
but they should at least be a good reason for it.
Lastly, F.U. to the tourists who visit the Adventure Dome who break the Bomani machines and act like idiots.
Okay, that's it.
Oh, Miko thought of an F.U.
kostjamrh I would have to say F U to the people who don't wear seatbelts, because Hailey, something from my school, just passed away because she did not wear a seatbelt.
And she was driving in the pouring rain and speeding, without a seat belt.
So she lost out of control and she crashed into some other cars.
And she's dead.
Well, that's Darwinism for you.
What?
Sorry.
Well, hard lesson learned unfortunately, that's too bad.
Wow.
At least she wasn't drunk.
At least she wasn't drunk and driving, because that's even worse if you ask me.
You throw like a girl, Jonas! I'm just kidding.
Okay, okay, I don't know.
Right here.
For somebody else, F you.
Ah, blow me.
Alright.
Alright.
Thanks.
Wow.
He does it again and the sun steps on the corner.
I wish it was that easy.
I wish I could just walk it up to some, you know, cute guy.
me
We are going to take a little breaky break here, and when we come back, we're going to
play some more Ultramix, I think, and we're also going to do some Ask Orange Lounge. How's
that sound, kids? Sound like fun? Yes, I thought so. All right, so we'll take a break, and
we'll be right back. You can send those questions for Ask Orange Lounge now to me, Skye, in
in the chatroom.
Tell me that you want me Tell me that you need me
Tell me that you want me Tell me that you love me
I'll be your dream Be my fantasy
I'll be your dream, you'll be my fantasy
I'll be your dream, I'll be your dream
I'll be your dream
You'll be my fantasy
Yeah
Let the dream come true
Let the dream come true
Let the dream control your mind
A little bit of ecstasy
Hello, and welcome back everybody to Orange Launch Radio, Episode 70, our season 4 premiere.
A few programming notes, things we need to tell you guys about, Vanilla Sky is going
to be moving, it's not going to be on Monday nights anymore, it's going to be on Wednesday
nights.
Those of you who are listening to the show this week know that Lanky Style got a brand
new job, which he started tonight, best of luck to him, but it's going to require that
he is not available Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday nights, so instead we're going to move the
show to Wednesday so he can still be a part of it, because they've been really good on
show and we've talked about a lot of interesting game things and non game
things so if you haven't tuned into that you should also back live this week on
Tuesday is my show pump up the volume the unappreciated pump up the volume
hit hit pre show at 7 show starts at 730 hang out in the chat room if you make a
request if I have it I'll play it it's that easy and make sure that like you
You get 20 people to sign in and listen to me this time, or I'll cry.
Okay.
Some of you may be asking yourselves, well, if Vanilla Sky is moving to Wednesdays, what's
happening to Livewire?
Well, I guess Loki would be best to answer that question, but I'll kind of answer it
for him.
He's going to be doing some intermittent stuff on Monday nights from now on.
He doesn't really want to go through the effort to make a new Livewire every single week,
because believe it or not, it's a lot of work.
easier than just turn on the microphones and throw on some music like the rest of us do.
So he's just going to do some stuff for Mondays intermittently and hopefully we'll still have
some special programming for you guys on Monday night.
Condition Zero will be back one of these days, won't it?
I unlocked the new BLT one.
Condition Zero will be back one of these days, won't it Zero?
Yes?
Yeah.
Yes, yes, yes.
All right, good.
All right, as promised, let's go back over to UltraMix.
mix.
Alright, it's unlocked.
They've just unlocked BLT style, so let's hear this, let's play, ooh this might be too
loud, sorry guys.
Well yeah, so it did on a fourth style.
Alright, play it
Of course, it sped up just like you would have thought it would.
Huh?
Yeah, a little bit.
Yeah, a little bit.
It's spelled out the same way that they're in 4th style.
namagem1
namagem1- I like this song a lot
namagem1- I'm hoping they didn't fuck it up
namagem1- I love the way it plays
namagem1- I love that song
namagem1- I'm hoping they didn't fuck it up
justdrop- I'm hoping they didn't fuck it up, but apparently zero says they have
dukeofthebump
p0k3smot42o have you noticed any new katas?
p0k3smot42o i think castle in the sky isnt a kata
p0k3smot42o on doubles i know it is on singles i know it is
kostjamrh What I don't like is that they rip the background from Fantasy from Max 2, the one by Lockout. It's a total rip-off of that background. Completely ripped off.
And the background is a castle in the sky, go figure.
I was expecting there to be a slow down there, but no.
It slowed down marginally, it's still slowing down.
Lots of freezes.
no it's a consistent tempo change like with insertion
yeah you usually don't see 16th note runs like that in licensed ones
Yeah, there's been quite a few in this.
some strange gallops there
And some folks wanted to hear the Metal Gear one, so we'll play that too.
We are playing a DDR Ultra MX-8 on Orange Pond's radio.
Oh, this isn't the one I was thinking it was.
This is the one that was...
the one from 6 and Core, home version
I'm kind of surprised this is only a 7, it's a little more 8-ish.
to me, especially with the 16th in it. Oh, it is an 8?
This doesn't look that hard at all.
I'm sorry, this looks more like a 6.
It doesn't look hard to us.
We're kind of jaded because we've beaten, you know,
Cat and stuff, but usually songs,
once they get 16th notes in them and stuff,
they're 8.
So that's all that surprises me.
I would honestly rank this song a 7.
But if they're opposing, they're easy to do.
If it's just
The same step being repeated, it's easy.
The only song that has a music video to it is the one with the half naked men in it.
The Maasai one, do that thing.
That was the only one.
So is that it for Ultramix? Do you guys want to play one more or what?
Okay, I'm going to do Keep Your Body Movin' by Spaghetti.
Yeah, I played that one.
Oh yeah, yeah, you did that one. We're going to do the There For You.
p0k3smot42o
It starts getting all jittery and crap, and it's like it's trying to load everything up
Which it's the Xbox and it should be able to do it, but I'm really slow at songs
It's almost like it starts the arrow starts shaking
It has the solo dogs.
You know what? I don't like free zeroes. I don't like free zeroes.
Free zeroes are good when used in moderation.
Yeah, there are too many
thejadedmieu 3 zeroes are good when used in moderation
kostjamrh Yeah, the too many ones were just excessive on the free zeroes. And the thing is, I don't play with free zeroes anyway because of my ankle.
Too many ones were just excessive on the free zeroes.
And the thing is, I don't play with free zeroes anyway because of my angle.
Anytime I'm there, I'll be there with you
Anytime I do what we do
Anytime we do what we do
Anytime, anytime
Weee, that was fun. That song did not excite me. That song was very familiar. No, it's
want to eat you up. Alright. No, I'm thinking the 2DX video because for the run for let's
talk it over. I'm going to, I'm going to fade out UltraMix there and we're going to take
a quick break and when we come back we're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge and then
wrap up the show, okay guys? So we will be right back, everybody. I'm just going to cue
up some music. Jamie, what did you want to hear this break?
The old Metal Gear one. The old Metal Gear one. So we will hear that
right now. We'll be back. Thanks for tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio.
Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Can you hear what I'm saying?
I'm gonna jam the chicken man, they'll watch it back

Down, what am I gonna do?
Have you ever seen a cool game like this?

Just to get up in so many nights
Leave me alone and run, run, run
Tell me why
Tell me why
If you feel my heart, but you feel this is mine And it means you better stay behind, my love

You better make the chances right now
Dance to the heartbeat
And let it go
You can follow that and you'll find it fun
Dance to the heartbeat
We're going to MP3 Pro soon, probably over Thanksgiving, so don't be surprised if you
hear a lot about how we've gone mp3 pro that means all that means is that if you
have a special codec installed on your mp3 player that you will be able to hear
DSL quality streaming at a dial-up standard so on the bitrate for the
station will go up a little bit but it'll still be modem friendly for those
who on thirty three six and fifty what is it fifty six K thirty five okay you'll
will be fine. If you're on 28.8 though, fucking A. Upgrade. Fuck. Ten bucks for a 56k modem.
I will buy you a modem. If you are seriously on 28.8 still, fucking email us at orangeloungeradioatyahoo.com
so we may mock you openly. It'll take them an hour to email us, Rob. Yeah, it'll take
them an hour to email us. But if you're on 33.6 or 56k, you'll still be fine. But the
bit rate will be up a little bit.
I sure don't think so as long as Jamie's around she's gonna dry me nuts of that fucking ferret until I set it on fire
All right
Question number one tonight from zodiac night
What bimani songs of those that were never released on any DDR mix before so what bimani songs not on a DDR mix yet
Would you guys and gals like to see come out in future downloads for Ultrix?
speaking of official though the safari
um... for me all the other tax songs that weren't released um...
powered
bad bye baby balloon is already in ddr he asks for ones that are already in ddr
amigo
okay so you want bad bye baby balloon as an ultramix download but
but um... we're talking songs that haven't already been in ddr that are in
some abamani game that's the deal
there you go
yeah like star mine there's one
Instant Love.
Okay.
My pick would be Power Dream, from 9th Style, because I fucking love that song.
Or just about anything in Kiryamoka, please, Bitmania, Love Me Do, would be fucking the
shit.
Showa, the 9th Style, the other 9th Style one that's not Lion Suki, but Lion Suki would
be good too.
So just about anything in Kiryamoka.
No.
Panorama.
Or Goonies Are Good Enough, from Popin' 10, please.
Thank you.
Panorama.
Yes.
Anybody else have a thought for Bomani Songs for Ultramix Download?
I think it would be cool to either see Traces, either the original or the remix, or to see...
I can't think of it right now. Crap, I went blank.
But it would be cool to see a good QQQ.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, Rizlim. Rizlim, please. Rizlim.
Okay. Wouldn't it be cool if we knew someone that could make an upgrade for an arcade cabinet
and they could put all these songs in there?
That would be cool. Yeah, that would be fucking great. Let Xplosive answer the question.
Let's see, what songs for the Bebop? Let me see, like, there's some songs from dusinfos.com
that seem good, like the V-Techno remix, or the Abyss, the Heavens mix. That would sound
good.
Cool. I like 23rd Magus's idea, you should too, Jamie. Schlagwerk.
Oh, Schlagwerk.
How about Schlagwerk? You know what? Fuck 2DX, let's put some Loki remixes in a DDR
he's got some pretty sweet ones miko you have an idea um i like monkey dance monkey dance yeah and
i also like uh what is it called deadline oh deadline would be a good one yeah deadline would
be great beauty of silence all right cool thanks okay let's go on to the next question shall we
um didi or dark child has a question for me because it says didi alcoholic right now but
Question for me, how long is it really limp and fully extended?
Ozzero is going to answer this, I don't know how he knows the answer but he wants to answer
this.
Well if I bend at the elbow it's about a foot long.
God damn it, you stole my joke.
If I put my arm straight out, it's about...
I would say kind of limp.
My finger is about two and a half inches, and when I fully extend that middle finger,
as I'm doing right now, when I fully extend that middle finger, I think I'm hitting a
good three inches there.
It's not about the size of the boat, it's about the motion in the ocean.
It's as big as you can airbrush it.
John Fields would like to know, will you please play my remix of Air for everyone to hear?
No.
Maybe in the after birth.
S Ghost would like to know, do you know why all the release dates for Ultramix are screwed
up?
I didn't know they were screwed up, I thought the game...
Let's say thank you to Microsoft.
Let's ask the guy that works at GameStop.
I believe you.
I'm sorry.
No, it's actually not that the release dates were messed up.
Since they, at the last minute, announced, basically about four days before they decided
to do it, that instead of being out on December 3rd, it was actually going to be out with
the pad and the game packaged, it was going to be out on the 18th. It was kind of something
they didn't really push out. And then, as far as I know, check it, December 3rd has
always been
the original release date
I'm getting yelled at for not answering that limp question honestly
uh...
let's see micro flaccid
Nince would like to know, this is a good question being asked by Nince here
why oh why are Magus's jokes so horribly bad?
okay
look at the originator of the jokes
and the amount of the true sense of humor
you're so mean
i know i am that's why i'm here
it's just like you have to understand your place in this world i wasn't meant
to sing
so i try not to
he wasn't meant to be funny so he should try not to
see it's really cool you gotta look at it this way
his jokes are so bad because he takes all that power from his freestyling
and he puts it into his jokes
and it just makes him so bad
that i mean you know you can't help but say how horrible they are
speaking of freestyling, imagine how he's gonna
i wonder what the judge is gonna say if he even participates in the tournaments
go ahead jonas
that's all i gotta say
i guess no comment
you're saying fuck you to jamie when i'm the one who just totally like
buffer there are thirty second don't forget there are about a minute
i was gonna say you know
alright
uh... but you know what in all seriousness he's a good sport for putting up with our
shit cause we're really fucking mean to him
uh... i swear just translated into portuguese and he'll be hilarious
Even funnier if you choose to read it.
Okay.
Moving on. Shit happens.
Twenty-third of the night goes to everyone.
Yeah, shit happens, but eventually you flash.
DarkTetsuya would like to know, did Jamie ever get to hear QQQAZAR, and if so,
what were her thoughts on it?
There's two versions. There's the one that Angel did and there's the one that Loki did.
So there's two versions and she's heard neither one.
No that I ever have, yeah.
So, maybe we'll send them to her later.
Let's see...
DJ Dark Knight.
Oh, he has DJ in his name. He must be a 2DX player.
Just messin', just messin'.
I don't like that shit. I don't like people to try to tell other people what they should, what the
can and can't put in your name. Can I want to be DJ whatever, go fucking for it. DJ
can stand for a lot of things, it could be somebody's name. I fucking hate it when people
F you of the week, I hope you're listening, pool boy, if somebody likes to rip on somebody
else for using DJ in their name, fuck you, you have no right to tell anybody what they
can and can't put in their name just because they're not a real DJ. God, that pisses me
right so we're radio DJs exactly exactly so we have every right to call ourselves
DJ and my DJ Celica is actually from 2dx I don't want to be a DJ I didn't like
her in full house okay well yeah he did have a question oh I heard rumors that
Sony was going to do a karaoke revolution game themselves I saw it on a
website. Is that true? Meaning that Sony was making a karaoke revolution type game themselves.
Well, we did report it on Vanilla Sky earlier this week that Sony has asked the folks behind
the iToy, because the iToy has done so well, to look into the possibilities of doing something
karaoke related. And I remember some third party company was doing something too. Namtai
was that it? Oh no, Namtai does the camera, but there was another company that's looking
into doing the karaoke thing too.
So, and...
Ah!
Stop!
Ah!
Will I kill you?
Stop throwing the goddamn mic at me!
Fuck, if it's not, like, sitting at the goddamn chair of the mic, like, wrapping around me
like some sort of cobra snake or like some sort of fucking snake, like anaconda or something
trying to wrap around me, it's like sitting on the floor just, this goddamn microphone
is trying to kill me.
Did you have your foot wrapped around your foot?
I don't care!
How's it going under my foot?
I swear!
going under my foot? I swear! Oh, I have to address this in the chatroom, Bill. They're
saying that they have the right to call themselves BJ. Then go do it! Anyways, no, um, you don't
happen to remember that one karaoke game I showed you at the store. I do remember that.
The one with the ugly box. Yeah, the one we put at the very back of the store, hopefully
nobody would see. Yeah, piece of shit. That's what, what the fuck would I play that shit
The only cool thing is that it comes with three discs of karaoke music and nothing else because it's shit.
No, you threw it too low.
You know what, though, I hope no one buys that because you know what's going to happen.
When one person buys it, they'll send your store 20 copies.
Alright, well maybe I ought to go in and buy it then, just to see.
You know what, I'm thinking of, one of the things I'm thinking of doing is actually getting
the PC version of Pump It Up.
To get the new one with all the newer songs on it, though.
So I can play it in my no room upstairs at Premiere.
I love Pump It Up.
We'll have more news on that as we know it, but Namtai's working on something.
They're also doing a dance game for the iToys, so they're ripping off Konami's ideas left
and right, so we'll see what happens.
has a question. When is Rob on Final Fantasy XI? You can find me on the Bismarck server
on Final Fantasy XI, usually in the evenings. Loki has a smartass answer I'm sure. All the
time? I was just going to say I was on there too. Since he says I have a smartass answer,
yeah he's always on there because he doesn't have a life. He just plays Final Fantasy XI
all the time. And sleeps. I'm on there too. I'm Tomosuke. He'll see me butchering rabbits
left and right, because that's what I do. I butcher small, innocent animals. Since there's
no kittens in the game, rabbits will have to suffice.
Okay. You know what? I don't know that I can play that game, because I got motion sick
watching Rob. Just play it blindfolded. Blink, blink. Alright. Play more Ragnarok. Alright.
You can play on the Ragnarok server, if only on C11. No. I'll play Ragnarok, thank you.
Okay, almost done, no more questions please, we have to wrap up this segment.
Jazz would also like to know, and why don't you listen to me and check out Graduizik Cyber
on Doubles Wii, because it says brand new 10-footers, especially on American Mix, should
get talked about.
It's a new 10-footer on Doubles, hooray, 10-footer, it would be nice if Wii was easier to play
doubles at home oh my god that's the first otaku no video reference I've seen
in like 20 like forever um Jason would like to ask why is it that when I have
orange lounge radio turned up high and Papa music 8 turned up just enough to
hear it that I can do so much better on songs than when Papa music 8 is blaring
and, of course, the only music sound being made.
So why is it when Orange Lounge Radio is on, he does even better?
Any thoughts?
I don't think that that made sense.
Because our enchanted voodoo powers make it possible.
Because we're great, end of story.
And Darkchild would like to know, how long is my penis?
But unfortunately, we're out of time, so we'll have to table that question next week.
Sorry, gang.
p0k3smot42o
Moving on, who's next? Jonas, any final thoughts?
Hmm, not really that much thought about it. Really not much. Except the fact that I've
got 23rd Magus thinking about the next tournament and what he's going to do.
Dude, Darkchild, you know I'm joking. Shut up.
I have a word of advice for those folks making 10 foot edits to max remixes and things like
that.
Go outside!
Seriously.
Go outside and take in some fresh air.
Please, make some friends, get a girlfriend, get laid, do you some good.
All right.
Tonight's final word, I'm going to give tonight's final word of the show to Mikko.
So one word, one word that sums everything up for you, Mikko, right now.
A one-letter word?
Just one word, no, one word.
One word.
Bye.
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Orange Lounge Radio is an Orange Lounge production.

of the day.
I grew up in San Francisco and you know like I grew up in the midst of Polk
Street hanky-code poppers San Francisco so that's like my childhood so I feel
like really comfortable and talking about my parents on a bookstore on Polk
Street and my mother was in charge of the gay porn which is like crazy she
would like like pull out these books and show me to talk about it these these
This book, it's called Ace Mista.
What is Ace Mista?
What is that? I don't know what Ace Mista is. Why do you know Ace Mista?
This book is an Ace Mista.
I don't, this is a gay, the book for gay because mommy don't know about the gay, you know.
The gay, they like ass. They do. They like ass so much, you know. They like ass and, but they like ass too much, you know.
You know, you have to have an ace in moderation, you know what I mean?
You cannot have an ace all the time, you know?
Because if you have an ass all the time, then it's not special.
You know what mommy is saying? There is a boy and his name is Paul. And mommy like Paul.
He's a nice boy but he's gay and he only like to sing.
You know, he like an ass and Judy Garland, and that's all.
And what kind of life is it like that?
That's all.
You know, there's an ass and an ass over the rainbow, and that's all.
What kind of life?
I don't know why they do this.
I have to look at this book, it's an ace mister.
SambPsar is going to look at this book.
I am going to look at it.
Look at mami, I am going to look at ace mister now.
Look at mami, okay, look at mami.
Ace mister.
I was shocked, you know. I was so shocked. It was just ass right away, you know.
I thought they would be table of contents, didn't they?
Thank you very much everybody.
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
Welcome everybody to the Orange Lounge Radio after birth for the parts that were too hot
for Orange Lounge Radio. You can hear them now.
So any after birth thoughts, Jamie? You were looking at some interesting movies
earlier. I think your mic might be off. Check the mic,
make sure it's not off. This has got Sable in it, in the bad fake
porn thing. But it's widescreen, so it's forgiven. Because pan and scan sucks.
Yeah, I don't like pan and scan either. Pan and scan is bad because you lose a part of
the picture. Everyone who says that the black bars cut
off the screen is an idiot. I realize where it can be irritating, but here's
what's most irritating. When they built the TVs, they should have made them the same size
as the movie screens, and then we would have never had this problem, so F whoever came
up with that idea.
Well, you know what, my next TV is going to be a widescreen TV.
Exactly, see that's the nice thing, now they are making the TVs the same size as the movies,
so people will never have to worry about the black bars, and are you missing something
with the widescreen, all that stuff, they won't have to worry about it ever again.
It's already been thought of.
You know what we need to do?
We need a chill-a-thon.
A chill-a-thon?
We need a chill-a-thon.
How so?
Like, just take those two DVDs and watch them back to back.
by me, and I have her new CD, so if I left it at work, don't.
It's okay.
And then just to break up the Jonas, watch Rejected.
Okay.
You know what?
It's weird that on Bitter Films that made Rejected has a new compilation coming out,
which should be good.
It's going to be a bunch of their stuff.
And they show Billy's balloon at Spike and Mike's, and that made me happy, because Billy's
balloon is great, because I love when balloons beat up little children.
Aww.
Did I get rid of it?
I don't think I would have deleted it, but I don't...
Oh, there it is.
There it is.
If your anus is bleeding, use a tampon.
I just got a copy off this Japanese site of max 30,000.
It's two seconds long.
That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard of in my entire life.
What the hell?
for the love of God, and all that is holy, my anus is bleeding, wow, that's great, that
sounded like me shitting, that sounds like a robot taking a shit, aww, bye Zero, nice
Nice knowing you.
Bye Nico.
Have fun in the castle.
Take care.
Okay, tonight's post show, we're going to start it off with that air remix, and then
after the air remix, we're going to go into that Now Dance 2004 compilation from Britain
because it's neat, and lots of good songs in it, including some Kylie Minogue, some
Ian Van Dau, and some other artists you may know from Balmani releases.
Enjoy.
night
