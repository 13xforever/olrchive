WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:18.000
Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.240
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Lonnie Toss and then some.

00:23.240 --> 00:26.520
Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

00:26.520 --> 00:30.520
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

00:30.520 --> 00:36.520
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

00:36.520 --> 00:40.520
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

00:40.520 --> 00:42.520
Yes, I will spank your child.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.520
If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

00:49.520 --> 00:51.520
Well, here's to my big opening.

00:51.520 --> 00:53.520
A sphincter says what?

00:53.520 --> 00:55.520
I'm super. Thanks for asking.

00:55.520 --> 00:57.820
You little bitch troll from hell!

00:57.820 --> 00:59.520
What am I doing here?

00:59.520 --> 01:01.520
Nooo!

01:01.520 --> 01:02.520
Dodge this.

01:02.520 --> 01:05.520
Mm-hmm. This is a tasty burger.

01:05.520 --> 01:08.220
Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left!

01:08.220 --> 01:10.020
It's a house? Look!

01:10.020 --> 01:11.320
It's a flesh wound.

01:11.320 --> 01:18.420
Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a polyshorn.

01:18.420 --> 01:23.020
Oh, yeah? Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

01:23.020 --> 01:24.220
Dark Sakura.

01:24.220 --> 01:25.580
I'm not a sniff

01:25.580 --> 01:26.080
Sky

01:26.080 --> 01:28.500
But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer

01:28.500 --> 01:29.260
Loki

01:29.260 --> 01:30.580
I hate you

01:30.580 --> 01:32.580

04:32.540 --> 04:37.540
episode number 69 so you know we had to do something for it cuz it was kind of

04:37.540 --> 04:41.380
starting to feel anti-climatic you know with Jamie not here unfortunately and

04:41.380 --> 04:47.340
just yeah yeah the one thing that's not going to be climactic tonight I think

04:47.340 --> 04:50.340

Also tonight a very special cage match, we're going to change the rules tonight, we're not

05:34.460 --> 05:38.620
cam tonight kids, sorry, but Loki has bought a new computer, which I'm sure he'll talk

05:38.620 --> 05:42.340
about a little later in the show, and because of that upgrade he hasn't had time to set

05:42.340 --> 05:47.420
up the cam, so we don't have a cam tonight, which is a good thing because we are all naked

05:47.420 --> 05:51.980
right now. Very naked. And I have to say, you have such nice breasts, Pixie Dust, you

05:51.980 --> 05:58.500
have very lovely breasts. Thank you. You're very welcome. And plants. Alright, we're going

05:58.500 --> 06:02.420
to start this off, we're going to take a quick break with some music from Dancing Stage Fever,

06:02.420 --> 06:06.180
the new game that came out in Europe not too long ago, some classic songs in there. You

06:06.180 --> 06:09.540
may have heard some of these tunes before, but now if you're in Europe or you have a

06:09.540 --> 06:16.540
way of playing Dancing Stage Fever. You can play these songs. We'll be back.

06:39.540 --> 06:50.300
Okay, we're going to have to cam that, I don't know what's going on, it's stopping going

06:50.300 --> 06:51.860
there, so let's see here.

06:51.860 --> 06:55.340
What I'll do is I'll copy the files over real fast, we'll do it a different way.

06:55.340 --> 06:56.980
Something weird's running with the network right now.

06:56.980 --> 07:02.500
In the meantime, Pasty Dust will do her 900 operator impersonation for you.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.980
Ring, ring, ring, ring.

07:04.980 --> 07:05.980
Hello.

07:05.980 --> 07:06.980
Hi.

07:06.980 --> 07:08.940
What's your name, little boy?

07:08.940 --> 07:14.060
My name is, um, uh, Loki.

07:14.060 --> 07:15.380
What are you into, little boy?

07:15.380 --> 07:19.500
Um, I'm into sex and big things.

07:19.500 --> 07:22.820
What kind of big things, Loki?

07:22.820 --> 07:24.380
Breasts.

07:24.380 --> 07:26.540
What do you like about them?

07:26.540 --> 07:27.540
They're bouncy.

07:27.540 --> 07:28.540
You're pathetic.

07:28.540 --> 07:29.540
Get off my line.

07:29.540 --> 07:30.540
Flick!

07:30.540 --> 07:36.740
Um, yeah, something weird's going on.

07:36.740 --> 07:40.180
The network's running really slow today, so I'm not able to run things off the network

07:40.180 --> 07:41.180
very well.

07:41.180 --> 07:46.460
Yeah, it's because we have a lot of stuff going through our network right now, so sorry

07:46.460 --> 07:47.460
guys.

07:47.460 --> 07:55.860
That's all right, we'll be okay.

07:55.860 --> 07:59.900
If you want to join our chat room and join in the big orgy that's going on in there,

07:59.900 --> 08:10.480

08:10.480 --> 08:14.520
And okay in this break we're going to hear it starting off with Asa Bass with All That

08:14.520 --> 08:19.520
She Wants will be the first song we hear from Dancing Stage Fever and then some more stuff

08:19.520 --> 08:22.580
that you may or may not recognize. So okay now that it's copied over to my drive let's

08:22.580 --> 08:29.580
try this again. We'll be right back.

08:52.580 --> 08:59.580
When she woke up late in the morning light And the day had just begun

08:59.580 --> 09:04.580
She opened up her eyes and thought Oh, what a morning

09:04.580 --> 09:09.580
It's not a day for words It's a day for catching time

09:09.580 --> 09:16.580
She was lying on the beach and having fun She's going to get you all that she wants

09:16.580 --> 09:23.580
All that she wants Is another baby

09:30.580 --> 09:37.580
All that she wants Is another baby

09:37.580 --> 09:44.580
All that she wants All that she wants

10:07.580 --> 10:21.580
Oh, how a journey it rides And it's time to pull up the radio

10:21.580 --> 10:31.580
With a billion hearts in common now Oh, how a journey it rides

10:31.580 --> 10:37.580
And it started from the radio With a billion hearts you wouldn't know

10:37.580 --> 10:41.580
I'll never be twice

10:41.580 --> 10:46.580
Sign along, oh baby

10:46.580 --> 10:49.580
Oh, you're not so brave

10:49.580 --> 10:54.580
But you're there with the same hope and terror

11:24.580 --> 11:46.220
Guess who just got back today Them wild night boys that had been away

11:46.220 --> 11:52.020
Haven't changed had much to say But man, I still think them cats are great

11:52.020 --> 11:57.020
They were asking if you were around How you was, where you could be found

11:57.020 --> 12:03.020
Told them you were living downtown Driving all the old men crazy

12:03.020 --> 12:08.020
The boys are back in town, boys are back in town

12:08.020 --> 12:15.020
I said, boys are back in town, boys are back in town

12:15.020 --> 12:17.700
Boys are back in town Boys are back in town

12:17.700 --> 12:21.020
Boys are back in town Boys are back in town

12:31.300 --> 12:34.460
Boys are back in town again

12:34.460 --> 12:58.360
And hang it down at Nemo's The boss will take us down again

12:58.360 --> 13:03.700
Hi this is Mel B of RTF and for an extra $1.99 a minute my girlfriend Mel B can join us on

13:33.700 --> 13:38.880
You guys have played karaoke revolution yet once you guys unlock the song one week

13:38.880 --> 13:42.380
We haven't done it here yet because I've been lazy and I haven't played karaoke revolution all week

13:42.380 --> 13:47.760
But once you unlock the song one week, apparently you get a video with it and in that video Mel makes a cameo

13:48.460 --> 13:53.360
He's I guess it's all these different people singing the song or something like that and he's in it. So

13:54.220 --> 13:58.700
Be on the lookout for that. Yes angel. Um, actually my friends

13:58.700 --> 14:07.180
his friend is actually in the game. He actually did voice for the game. His name is Bert.

14:07.180 --> 14:10.860
I only know his first name. Do you know what he sang in it? The Eagle Eye Cherry Song.

14:10.860 --> 14:16.180
The what? Oh, Safe Tonight? Hey, I can get a good squaw on that one. Maybe because Bert's

14:16.180 --> 14:20.460
helping you see. Maybe if we get bored the last segment we could fire up Karaoke Revolution

14:20.460 --> 14:24.880
and see who's an all-star here. Because I haven't seen it yet. Maybe. We'll see how

14:24.880 --> 14:29.800
how desperate for material we get. We'll see. Desperate? Who says we're ever desperate?

14:29.800 --> 14:34.800
It's episode 69. We're very, very desperate. Speaking of desperate, hey Andrew, how you

14:34.800 --> 14:48.600
doing? Wonderful. I ain't desperate for nothing. Oh, really? How about a good joke? Alright,

14:48.600 --> 15:02.120
In that break we play a bunch of stuff from Dancing Stage Fever, Feces, and in Dancing

15:02.120 --> 15:10.360
Stage Faces we have Asa Bass with All That She Wants, Dexi's Midnight Runners with Come

15:10.360 --> 15:13.740
On Eileen, and Thin Lizzy with The Boys Are Back in Town.

15:13.740 --> 15:29.460
Maybe later on in the show we'll play some of the less good tracks from it so we'll see.

15:29.460 --> 15:33.960
Even though it's episode number 69, I figured we'd start the show off as we always do with

15:33.960 --> 15:38.160
a little bit of how was your day, how was your week.

15:38.160 --> 15:40.800
So let's go around and see how everybody's day and their week was.

15:40.800 --> 15:45.660
I will start tonight because I never started this segment off, so I'm going to start.

15:45.660 --> 15:51.720
Yesterday was the one and only, for those of you in NorCal, Recacon, which is a small

15:51.720 --> 15:56.780
convention they did at a community college for anime and video games and all that dorky

15:56.780 --> 15:57.780
fun stuff.

15:57.780 --> 16:02.440
They did this at a community college in Pittsburgh, California, which is in the East Bay.

16:02.440 --> 16:07.760
And this was my very first anime convention.

16:07.760 --> 16:13.760
pixie dust just had her period right through her pants that is amazing what the hell did

16:13.760 --> 16:19.600
you do pixie dust give her a mic give her a mic oh it's definitely sorry the sour sauce

16:20.880 --> 16:26.160
fuck you fuck you fuck you that wasn't even a joke did you catch that he just made another

16:26.160 --> 16:32.480
nun myself so it's not really that great i just looked like it was a painting so it's okay it just

16:32.480 --> 16:38.240
It just looked like she got rammed so hard that she's bleeding right now.

16:38.240 --> 16:41.480
What am I going to talk about last night, Rob?

16:41.480 --> 16:46.400
Well, they missed by a long shuck because that's your thigh and nowhere near where it

16:46.400 --> 16:47.720
needs to be.

16:47.720 --> 16:51.160
Well, right here, you know.

16:51.160 --> 16:53.480
Anyway, Rekacon, hello.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.400
I think we have people listening today that actually went to Rekacon yesterday.

16:56.400 --> 17:00.040
So hello to all our new listeners that were at Rekacon yesterday because I hoard out the

17:00.040 --> 17:04.740
the station and business cards and Jahi, bless his little heart, let me get on the mic and

17:04.740 --> 17:09.400
kind of plug things too. So that was very nice of him. Thank you, Jahi. So, what did

17:09.400 --> 17:11.520
you guys think of Rekha Khan? Did you guys have a good time? What kind of stuff did you

17:11.520 --> 17:14.800
guys do? Anything you saw for the first time, got to play for the first time, things like

17:14.800 --> 17:18.400
that? No silent. I just walked around, man. You just walked around? You were just there

17:18.400 --> 17:24.720
for the people? That's like me. Yeah, basically that's it. That's like me. There hasn't been

17:24.720 --> 17:28.720
any DDR tournaments in NorCal really lately. There was one a couple weeks ago that I couldn't

17:28.720 --> 17:32.280
go. So this was kind of like a chance for me to see everybody because I haven't seen

17:32.280 --> 17:36.300
them in a long time. So, did you get to play any new interesting games or did you buy anything

17:36.300 --> 17:41.280
at the expo or anything like that? Oh, it's completely broke and I thought nothing was

17:41.280 --> 17:50.280
necessary. Blah. I have to ask, no milkshakes? No, no milkshakes. Oh, okay. None at all.

17:50.280 --> 17:56.280
None at all. What the fuck? Yeah, I find that weird, you know, just everybody comes up to

17:56.280 --> 18:04.900
I'm just going to say it, your online personality and your in-life personality are so different.

18:04.900 --> 18:06.620
So, so different, no stylist.

18:06.620 --> 18:09.380
I mean, not that it's a bad thing.

18:09.380 --> 18:10.380
I'm just saying.

18:10.380 --> 18:14.420
Now it looks like I peed on myself since I tried to clean it up.

18:14.420 --> 18:15.420
Fuck!

18:15.420 --> 18:18.820
Why don't you hand the mic off to Angel over there.

18:18.820 --> 18:19.820
Hey, Angel.

18:19.820 --> 18:21.620
Angel, what did you think of Wrecker Hunt?

18:21.620 --> 18:22.620
Sweet.

18:22.620 --> 18:24.980
Did you get to play any new games for the first time or do anything?

18:24.980 --> 18:39.420
I got to see the, did somebody just say that Janae had a maxi period?

18:39.420 --> 18:40.420
That was horrible.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.420
Die.

18:41.420 --> 18:47.780
You're lucky I know you are, unless I kick your ass, you're sick.

18:47.780 --> 18:54.100
Anyway Angel, yesterday, Rekha Khan.

18:54.100 --> 19:00.100
Let's see. God, I almost spelt that away on manga, but, um, I resisted.

19:00.100 --> 19:03.100
It was your poor. I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.

19:03.100 --> 19:10.100
Um, not really, but, yeah, I mean, there's better things I should be saving for at the moment, so.

19:10.100 --> 19:14.100
Um, yeah. So is life. Excuse me.

19:14.100 --> 19:15.100
That's cool.

19:15.100 --> 19:16.100
Anyway.

19:16.100 --> 19:18.100
Did you meet anybody new yesterday you hadn't met before?

19:18.100 --> 19:32.100
Jahi, Mr. Wendell, obviously no stylin, Iwanaki2DX, StaplarX, and a bunch of their friends who came over.

19:32.100 --> 19:36.100
So yeah, that's a lot of people.

19:36.100 --> 19:42.100
Okay. Let's see, what about Magus? Magus, what did you think of the 69th Magus? What did you think of the Rekka Khan yesterday?

19:42.100 --> 19:44.100
Rekka Khan was just plain awesome.

19:44.100 --> 19:47.100
And did you get to play anything new for the first time that you haven't played before?

19:47.100 --> 19:54.100
I got to play Taiko no Tetsujin. I got to play that new Dragon Quest Slime Morimori Adventure.

19:54.100 --> 19:58.100
Yes, the Dragon Quest with the real sword. That game looked so sweet. I didn't get a chance to play it.

19:58.100 --> 20:03.100
It was the most popular thing in the game room and everybody was kind of crowded around it, but it looked really cute.

20:03.100 --> 20:08.100
I just wanted to play it, but I love the way the enemies are drawn.

20:08.100 --> 20:13.100
They updated all the whole enemies, like the slimes. Well, not just cel-shaded, but they made them look sweet.

20:13.100 --> 20:16.960
I don't know if they did the redone, it looks good, it plays pretty well.

20:16.960 --> 20:20.420
I was kind of surprised though, I was thinking that the Dragon Quest sword game was going

20:20.420 --> 20:24.520
to be just like, somebody had told me, oh it's just the very first Dragon Quest except

20:24.520 --> 20:25.920
you use the sword as a controller.

20:25.920 --> 20:29.500
I was like, well that's kind of weird, but it's actually this whole new original game.

20:29.500 --> 20:33.100
It kind of struck me as like a super scope game to me.

20:33.100 --> 20:37.140
It looked a lot like a game you'd be playing with a super scope, where like you'd be shooting

20:37.140 --> 20:42.740
the slimes but instead you use the sword.

20:42.740 --> 20:44.740
So that was fun. Good times.

20:44.740 --> 20:49.740
We got to meet a lot of new faces. Basically met everyone that Angel met.

20:49.740 --> 20:50.740
Yep.

20:50.740 --> 20:55.740
We had a good time. We watched some AMVs in the video room.

20:55.740 --> 20:57.740
What were some good music videos you guys saw?

20:57.740 --> 20:59.740
The chibi things that kill.

20:59.740 --> 21:00.740
Uh huh.

21:00.740 --> 21:04.740
A complete waste of six minutes and forty-five seconds.

21:04.740 --> 21:05.740
Okay.

21:05.740 --> 21:15.460
And this one too, In the Navy, where they started spoofing all these battle cruiser

21:15.460 --> 21:16.460
animes.

21:16.460 --> 21:17.460
Interesting.

21:17.460 --> 21:18.460
Okay.

21:18.460 --> 21:19.460
Cool deal.

21:19.460 --> 21:24.140
Um, so yeah, Wreck or Crawl was just, it was great, it was my first convention, I've never

21:24.140 --> 21:28.860
been to any kind of anime or geek convention, really, ever, unless you count wacky horror

21:28.860 --> 21:30.260
conventions, those are kind of geeky.

21:30.260 --> 21:33.660
But actually, that's more of like a sex thing, because people get laid at those, except me.

21:33.660 --> 21:37.960
Anyway, but ironically enough, the Rocky Horror Convention was the very first place I ever

21:37.960 --> 21:38.960
played DDR.

21:38.960 --> 21:43.300
Anyway, that was my first non-RockyCon, and good times.

21:43.300 --> 21:44.620
I just like getting to see people.

21:44.620 --> 21:46.260
I don't know much about anime.

21:46.260 --> 21:47.820
I don't really watch a lot of it, admittedly.

21:47.820 --> 21:52.180
I'm one of those few DDR players that just... I've seen a couple Miyazaki films and

21:52.180 --> 21:57.180
I watched Pokemon back when it was cool, but I haven't really gotten as into anime.

21:57.180 --> 21:58.840
I kind of rely on Jamie for all that.

21:58.840 --> 22:01.860
She's really into anime, and she just kind of tells me what's good and what's not, and

22:01.860 --> 22:06.160
And Loki being the hookup also knows some good and not good things.

22:06.160 --> 22:07.800
But I saw a lot of great cosplayers.

22:07.800 --> 22:08.800
There were some cute cosplayers.

22:08.800 --> 22:12.380
There was a lot of Final Fantasy cosplayers, and I'm always a sucker for anything Final

22:12.380 --> 22:13.380
Fantasy.

22:13.380 --> 22:16.040
And there were some X2 characters.

22:16.040 --> 22:20.300
And there was a whole little group that had like a squall and a yuffie and all this stuff

22:20.300 --> 22:21.300
in it.

22:21.300 --> 22:24.620
It was really cute.

22:24.620 --> 22:26.980
One thing that made me very happy is that there was a Mai.

22:26.980 --> 22:29.100
Somebody came dressed as Mai from Final Fight.

22:29.100 --> 22:34.840
me happy.

22:34.840 --> 22:35.840
Link was cool.

22:35.840 --> 22:40.200
Oh yeah, they had not just one, but two people dressed up as Link, which I thought was cool.

22:40.200 --> 22:44.240
They actually had a Link and a Saria.

22:44.240 --> 22:47.440
Later on, after the cosplay, they had karaoke.

22:47.440 --> 22:56.360
So we had a guy dressed up as Zelcine invoke rather well, too.

22:56.360 --> 23:02.380
And if you've ever been to an anime convention at all, Ramen and Rice had shown up to this

23:02.380 --> 23:03.380
one as well.

23:03.380 --> 23:04.380
Oh my God.

23:04.380 --> 23:08.580
Now people tell me Ramen and Rice are at every single anime convention in the area, so it's

23:08.580 --> 23:13.900
kind of like, but this is the first time I saw them, and I was like, they are so cool.

23:13.900 --> 23:16.560
These girls play like everything on their violinists.

23:16.560 --> 23:18.260
I want to get some of their stuff for the station.

23:18.260 --> 23:20.620
I should email, do some emails.

23:20.620 --> 23:24.420
I'm a violinist myself, and they're awesome.

23:24.420 --> 23:28.420
Oh, I would have thought you were a pianist.

23:28.420 --> 23:31.420
No, but I have one.

23:31.420 --> 23:32.420
Crap.

23:32.420 --> 23:34.420
Be more funny.

23:34.420 --> 23:37.420
Follow your own advice.

23:37.420 --> 23:41.420
Anyway, we wound up requesting, like, butterfly and scars of time from people across.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.420
Damn you, damn you.

23:42.420 --> 23:43.420
And you're the one that got them to play butterfly.

23:43.420 --> 23:44.420
Yes, I'm the one that got them to play butterfly.

23:44.420 --> 23:45.420
I hope you die.

23:45.420 --> 23:47.420
I hope you die and you burn in hell.

23:47.420 --> 23:48.420
Just kidding.

23:48.420 --> 23:50.420
It's pretty hot in this room already.

23:50.420 --> 23:56.420
Walked right into the pianist's quip, didn't you, Magus?

23:56.420 --> 23:59.100
I would have given my left nut to hear them play Scars of Time.

23:59.100 --> 24:00.740
I'm so sad I didn't stay around for that.

24:00.740 --> 24:01.740
I bet it kicked ass.

24:01.740 --> 24:03.980
Oh, I did and I still have mine.

24:03.980 --> 24:07.180
I did hear them play some stuff from Final Fantasy X, though, which made me all horny

24:07.180 --> 24:08.180
because it was great.

24:08.180 --> 24:13.380
Well, uh, see, at the time they played Scars of Time, you hadn't gotten there yet, Mr.

24:13.380 --> 24:14.380
Fashionably Late.

24:14.380 --> 24:17.380
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, bitch.

24:17.380 --> 24:18.380
I'm just kidding.

24:18.380 --> 24:19.380
Love you.

24:19.380 --> 24:20.380
Oh, really?

25:20.380 --> 25:25.940
come back an hour later and there he goes, he's still going. He's the man, he's the man.

25:25.940 --> 25:31.020
You've got to come up and be on the show sometime. Anyway, so also on How Was My Week, How Was

25:31.020 --> 25:38.300
My Day, something worth noting, talking about is this thing that I did on Thursday. I got

25:38.300 --> 25:44.100
asked to promote Orange Lounge Radio in a way at this local high school. I judged a

25:44.100 --> 25:51.240
local high school's American Idol-style competition, and it was very interesting. I don't know

25:51.240 --> 25:54.240
if anybody from there is listening tonight, probably not because they only mentioned the

25:54.240 --> 25:58.740
station like twice, and I only gave out one business card to the guy who I thought was

25:58.740 --> 26:02.740
most talented out of everybody, mostly because he wrote his own music, and it was fucking

26:02.740 --> 26:06.380
funny. It was something like Adam Sandler would have done, and I'm actually in talks

26:06.380 --> 26:10.340
with him right now trying to get a song of his to spin on the show so you guys can see

26:10.340 --> 26:17.220
what I'm talking about, but it was very interesting because it was me and two interns from one

26:17.220 --> 26:20.940
of the local Sacramento stations, or I don't know, they work in the promotions department

26:20.940 --> 26:23.420
or something like that, and two teachers.

26:23.420 --> 26:28.180
So it was supposed to be like all these local celebrities and I was going to be like the

26:28.180 --> 26:33.020
nobody but I ended up being the only one that actually was on a radio program of any kind

26:33.020 --> 26:34.660
so that was kind of interesting.

26:34.660 --> 26:39.540
I also ended up being the asshole judge because I was the only one willing to say anything

26:39.540 --> 26:44.340
remotely constructive about anybody, because everybody, all the other judges are like,

26:44.340 --> 26:48.300
Oh my God, you're so great, you're just like Claire Aiken, you're better than Claire Aiken,

26:48.300 --> 26:52.540
oh my God, you should be an American Idol, okay?

26:52.540 --> 26:54.500
You have an awesome voice.

26:54.500 --> 27:00.820
Yeah, and then the one guy was like, you have an awesome voice, you are gonna go far, and

27:00.820 --> 27:05.460
then the next person was like, you're gonna go so far, because you have an awesome voice.

27:05.460 --> 27:07.580
And then the next person would come up and go,

27:07.580 --> 27:11.020
you have an awesome voice, and it's going to take you very far.

27:11.020 --> 27:13.240
It was the same thing for everybody.

27:13.240 --> 27:16.460
You have an awesome voice, and it's going to take you very far.

27:16.460 --> 27:18.100
If it's going to take you so damn far,

27:18.100 --> 27:20.440
get your ass out of the room.

27:20.440 --> 27:25.020
And then finally, it would come to me, and I'd be all,

27:25.020 --> 27:27.140
you brought your words up on the stage,

27:27.140 --> 27:31.020
and that looks really tacky type thing.

27:31.020 --> 27:33.420
And then there was another girl.

27:33.420 --> 27:35.380
This was the one that pissed me off, though.

27:35.380 --> 27:38.620
This was weird because I haven't been back to high school in a long time.

27:38.620 --> 27:41.020
This was the first time I'd kind of...

27:41.020 --> 27:42.420
Shut up.

27:42.420 --> 27:44.020
Shut up.

27:44.020 --> 27:45.500
I graduated in 96.

27:45.500 --> 27:46.500
Fuck you.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.220
I really didn't think so.

27:48.220 --> 27:49.220
Seven years ago.

27:49.220 --> 27:50.220
Bitch.

27:50.220 --> 27:51.220
Yeah.

27:51.220 --> 27:52.220
Yeah.

27:52.220 --> 27:53.220
Yeah.

27:53.220 --> 27:54.220
You thought.

27:54.220 --> 27:55.220
Well, you need to think more next time.

27:55.220 --> 27:56.220
I'm just kidding.

27:56.220 --> 27:57.220
I love you.

27:57.220 --> 27:58.220
I've been a bad girl.

27:58.220 --> 27:59.220
You've been a bad girl.

27:59.220 --> 28:00.220
I'm going to punish you.

28:00.220 --> 28:03.940
I haven't set foot in a high school in a long time and I remembered why.

28:03.940 --> 28:08.540
There was this one girl up there who I guess she wasn't that popular or something because

28:08.540 --> 28:09.540
she did her thing.

28:09.540 --> 28:12.560
She was singing Hit We With Her Best Shot and she was doing a good job.

28:12.560 --> 28:15.540
I would have liked to have seen her get into it a little more, but she had a lot of courage

28:15.540 --> 28:17.260
to get up there on stage and she was having fun with it.

28:17.260 --> 28:18.860
It looked like she had a lot of fun with it.

28:18.860 --> 28:22.860
And of course it goes, and the first person goes, it goes, oh my God, you were really

28:22.860 --> 28:23.860
great.

28:23.860 --> 28:28.140
You're just like Kelly Clarkson and you're going to be better than her.

28:28.140 --> 28:31.940
And then the next person got up and goes, you have a totally awesome voice and it's

28:31.940 --> 28:33.900
It's going to take you so far in life.

28:33.900 --> 28:35.540
And then somebody else in the audience goes,

28:35.540 --> 28:39.060
these people in the audience start yelling, liar.

28:39.060 --> 28:42.420
And while it was mildly amusing, I was like, OK, that's

28:42.420 --> 28:42.980
fucked up.

28:42.980 --> 28:45.420
And you shouldn't do that when this poor girl's getting up

28:45.420 --> 28:49.100
on stage making a fool out of herself for your entertainment.

28:49.100 --> 28:52.740
So the mic got over to me and I said, hey, you know what?

28:52.740 --> 28:54.940
Girl, you've got a lot of balls to get up here on stage

28:54.940 --> 28:55.460
and do that.

28:55.460 --> 28:58.460
And you're going to be able to accomplish a lot of life

28:58.460 --> 28:59.880
unlike some of these people who will

28:59.880 --> 29:01.420
be sitting in the dark forever.

29:01.420 --> 29:03.440
and then the guys in the audience were like,

29:03.440 --> 29:05.980
blah, blah, blah, blah.

29:05.980 --> 29:09.600
And the teacher next to me leaned over and said,

29:09.600 --> 29:11.080
thank you for saying that.

29:11.080 --> 29:13.740
And that made me feel good because I hate assholes.

29:13.740 --> 29:14.340
I hate them.

29:14.340 --> 29:17.060
And those people in high school were just like the ones I hated

29:17.060 --> 29:18.900
and would call me fag all the time and stuff.

29:18.900 --> 29:22.300
And they need to like burn in hell because they suck.

29:22.300 --> 29:24.220
I don't care if they were right, Nelly.

29:24.220 --> 29:25.020
It doesn't matter.

29:25.020 --> 29:26.020
That's beside the point.

29:26.020 --> 29:28.820
You're missing the point.

29:28.820 --> 29:30.660
Anyway, that was my week and my day.

29:30.660 --> 29:32.660
Loki, how was your week of your day?

30:00.660 --> 30:06.500
downloading off the internet I'm only getting like one kbps so it's like I don't get it

30:06.500 --> 30:13.060
so I don't whatever it's fine I guess but it's no got a larger hard drive and I have

30:13.060 --> 30:19.740
a computer for my cabinet but I had to go to Fry's a lot this weekend that sucked and

30:19.740 --> 30:28.780
yeah that's pretty much it went to that thing that Rob was talking about and that was okay

30:28.780 --> 30:34.220
And yeah, I didn't do much.

30:34.220 --> 30:35.660
My week was awesome.

30:35.660 --> 30:39.460
It will take me far in life.

30:39.460 --> 30:41.900
Yelled at people today.

30:41.900 --> 30:42.700
Mostly Andrew.

30:45.580 --> 30:49.180
Yeah, that's about it.

30:49.180 --> 30:51.460
I didn't do much.

30:51.460 --> 30:53.940
OK, let's hear from some of our guests then, Pixie Dust.

30:53.940 --> 30:55.220
I know you got a lot to say.

30:55.220 --> 30:55.940
How was your day?

30:55.940 --> 30:57.580
I didn't have my period on my pants.

30:57.580 --> 31:00.220
It was Peter Sauer's song, god damn it!

31:01.220 --> 31:03.220
But before that, how was your week? What did you do this week?

31:03.220 --> 31:04.820
I haven't seen you in like two months.

31:04.820 --> 31:06.660
I know! I've been flawed.

31:06.660 --> 31:07.820
It made me sad.

31:07.820 --> 31:09.580
No, I didn't!

31:09.580 --> 31:11.620
I made you relieved that you didn't have to pull up with me.

31:11.620 --> 31:13.340
Oh, shut up.

31:13.340 --> 31:15.580
Well, how was your week? What did you do?

31:15.580 --> 31:17.900
What did I do this week?

31:17.900 --> 31:20.020
I fucking don't know!

31:20.020 --> 31:21.420
It just went by!

31:21.420 --> 31:23.420
Or should I say, who did you do this week?

31:23.420 --> 31:25.420
There's this strange guy behind me,

31:25.420 --> 31:30.500
Yeah, he's been kissing me all weekend long, so I don't know.

31:30.500 --> 31:32.220
I picked him up off the side of the road.

31:32.220 --> 31:33.220
Did you?

31:33.220 --> 31:34.220
Yeah.

31:34.220 --> 31:35.220
How much did it cost you?

31:35.220 --> 31:36.220
You're pretty cheap.

31:36.220 --> 31:38.220
You're like five cents, right?

31:38.220 --> 31:44.940
No, seriously, school work has like, occupied all my time, so I haven't been doing much

31:44.940 --> 31:47.380
of anything except been home on the phone.

31:47.380 --> 31:51.780
Have you gotten out to play any Bamani recently or anything?

31:51.780 --> 31:52.780
No.

31:52.780 --> 31:54.940
Now, we haven't had you on the show in a long time.

31:54.940 --> 32:05.540
you ever pick up Max 2 for the home? No comment on that. Oh, I see a little bitterness there.

32:05.540 --> 32:10.780
I have a little bitterness towards sending someone. And you guys all know. I won't say

32:10.780 --> 32:23.200
no more. I don't know, who is it? It's you! You bastard! And basically, this fool came

32:23.200 --> 32:29.300
up to see me. And you went to Rekordkon, yes? And I went to Rekordkon. And I called in sick

32:29.300 --> 32:33.820
to work. Shame on you. You called in sick to work to go to Rekordkon? I called in sick

32:33.820 --> 32:39.820
to work because Victor came up. Oh, I see. Not to see your asses. Oh, I see how it is.

32:39.820 --> 32:44.260
No, we, no. Shut up. Bitch, pass that mic. Just kidding. It's mine now. She almost said

32:44.260 --> 32:49.660
what I want. You're an ass. You're an ass, Victor. But yeah, it's been good. I miss you,

32:49.660 --> 32:59.520
The chat room was reminding me of a good thing that happened at the con, something kind of

32:59.520 --> 33:00.520
funny.

33:00.520 --> 33:04.720
Richie, EvilMaukie2Dx, one of the folks at Frigous Art Chat Room, he caught on fire!

33:04.720 --> 33:05.720
No, I'm kidding.

33:05.720 --> 33:06.720
He did not.

33:06.720 --> 33:07.720
No, I'm kidding.

33:07.720 --> 33:08.720
God people.

33:08.720 --> 33:09.720
You're gullible.

33:09.720 --> 33:10.720
Look up gullible.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.760
He had this sign that said, I like maids.

33:12.760 --> 33:18.240
When I first saw him there at the con, we were all outside, and Richie, I think I saw

33:18.240 --> 33:26.340
a maid cosplayer inside and it was just like, boom! Have you ever seen one of those Roadrunner

33:26.340 --> 33:39.680
cartoons? That was like Richie. There was a maid cosplayer inside. No one noticed me.

33:39.680 --> 33:47.760
I was surprised. They did. A lot of people don't know who you are. They don't know you're

33:47.760 --> 33:52.480
the Orange Lounge. Madam. Yes, I am. I'm the only one with a foot behind my head. That's

33:52.480 --> 33:58.400
all it is. They gave me that. No one noticed me. I guess I was playing the other day. Anything

33:58.400 --> 34:10.920
exciting today? Hmm. Cake. And fried Twinkies. Alright. No Stylin. Let's hear from No Stylin.

34:10.920 --> 34:14.000
I know he doesn't talk much in person compared to online, but we'll try to get something

34:14.000 --> 34:21.160
I'm two different people from online and real life.

34:21.160 --> 34:22.160
It's okay.

34:22.160 --> 34:23.720
I'm just making this observation.

34:23.720 --> 34:27.720
I would be a little scared if you were kind of bouncing off your walls and changing your

34:27.720 --> 34:29.920
nickname every five seconds like you do on IRC.

34:29.920 --> 34:30.920
That's okay.

34:30.920 --> 34:31.920
Multipersonalities, yeah.

34:31.920 --> 34:32.920
It's all good.

34:32.920 --> 34:35.200
Do you have any shout outs you want to give while you're here?

34:35.200 --> 34:42.240
Yeah, Dennis wanted to give a shout out to his homie Maple, I think, from Stockton.

34:42.240 --> 34:43.240
That's it.

34:43.240 --> 34:48.240
listen to the show, I don't think, but that's okay. I'm teasing, I'm teasing. I always think

34:48.240 --> 34:51.960
that nobody listens to the show. Well, how was your week? What did you do? Let's see,

34:51.960 --> 34:57.960
came up this weekend, met a special person, you know, really cool, nice, lovable, huggable.

34:57.960 --> 35:05.560
Oh, just talk about Angel all you want. Okay, I realize it's episode 69 and all, but let's

35:05.560 --> 35:09.560
not make me barf, okay, from all this lovey-dovey chat, because I'm the only single person in

35:09.560 --> 35:14.800
this room right now, who's not dating someone else in the room, so I feel really like a

35:14.800 --> 35:15.800
seventh wheel right now.

35:15.800 --> 35:16.800
Okay, I'll tell you this.

35:16.800 --> 35:17.800
What happened?

35:17.800 --> 35:18.800
All right.

35:18.800 --> 35:24.500
Coming back from Hollywood video, first time coming to Sacramento and everything, and whoever

35:24.500 --> 35:30.480
designs these layouts for these stores and malls, this huge rock, I ran over this rock

35:30.480 --> 35:31.480
and I was clinging in mid-air.

35:31.480 --> 35:32.480
It was hilarious.

35:32.480 --> 35:33.480
We were hovering.

35:33.480 --> 35:34.480
Oh my God, a rock.

35:34.480 --> 35:41.480
I was on the passenger side and I was like, what the fuck did you hit? I thought it was

35:42.880 --> 35:49.880
a fire hydrant. Well, that was interesting. But it was like, oh shit. So, that was interesting.

35:51.880 --> 35:58.880
Well, I'm taking your time. That's cool. And that's pretty much my day. Or week. Alright.

35:59.480 --> 36:04.440
Angel, how was your week? Hi Rob. Hi, how are you? Good. Didn't your local

36:04.440 --> 36:06.440
Did you get a new Bimani game recently?

36:08.440 --> 36:09.440
Percussion Freaks

36:09.440 --> 36:11.440
Percussion Freaks? No, not Drum Freaks, but Percussion Freaks

36:11.440 --> 36:13.440
Well, it's Drummania, but I mean, it's Drummania

36:13.440 --> 36:17.440
I know, but it's a different name, so that makes it worth talking about

36:17.440 --> 36:22.440
Well, I suppose it's a different name, except for the fact that it still says Drummania on the stupid machine

36:22.440 --> 36:23.440
Have you gotten a chance to play it at all?

36:23.440 --> 36:24.440
No

36:24.440 --> 36:26.440
Oh, well then fuck it, tell us about your week

36:26.440 --> 36:35.800
Um, let's see, I pretty much worked all week except for like school on Thursday, which

36:35.800 --> 36:40.880
I was sick for, so I didn't go, but that's okay, um, then I just pretty much waited out

36:40.880 --> 36:51.400
the rest of the week until I got here, so yay, huh, anyway, I'm gonna be boring now,

36:51.400 --> 36:55.600
boring and monotoned and neh.

36:55.600 --> 36:57.100
That's pie!

36:57.100 --> 36:58.600
Pie!

36:58.600 --> 37:00.100
Yoo, pie.

37:00.100 --> 37:01.100
Mmm.

37:01.100 --> 37:03.500
Pie.

37:03.500 --> 37:06.400
Andrew, the 69th magazine, how was your week?

37:06.400 --> 37:08.600
How was your day?

37:08.600 --> 37:15.300
Uh, week, long and hard, like, never mind.

37:15.300 --> 37:17.700
Over.

37:17.700 --> 37:18.600
Over.

37:18.600 --> 37:26.400
But I kind of went through the motions of just going to school, yes, I'm making all

37:26.400 --> 37:33.160
these terrible puns, and just went to school, went home, went to school, went home, went

37:33.160 --> 37:38.160
to school, went home, went to school, went home all week, and finally Saturday rolled

37:38.160 --> 37:42.400
around, went to RecCon, and wee fun.

37:42.400 --> 37:47.840
So the rest of the week with Boring Weekend is just all hyper and happy and shit.

37:47.840 --> 37:52.160
If I do the 5, 6, 7, 8 song one more time, I swear to...

37:52.160 --> 37:53.160
Oh shit!

37:53.160 --> 37:56.160
No, not twisted earth!

37:56.160 --> 38:10.320
You should see, Nellie, you should see what else I can whistle.

38:10.320 --> 38:13.320
I can blow these lips very well, Millie.

38:13.320 --> 38:19.320
He's quite talented at the meat flute.

38:19.320 --> 38:23.320
Have you ever heard the milkshake song, the ghetto milkshake song?

38:23.320 --> 38:27.920
Alright, we're going to take a break and when we come back we'll talk about some more Bamani

38:27.920 --> 38:32.120
and I think we will have ourselves a cage match.

38:32.120 --> 38:35.800
But the rules for the cage match tonight are a little bit different.

38:35.800 --> 38:38.320
I'll be in the cage actually dancing topless.

38:38.320 --> 38:43.320
No, so stay tuned for that, because we're going to have ourselves a cage match when we come back.

38:43.320 --> 38:46.320
And we'll talk about a whole bunch of other stuff, too.

38:46.320 --> 38:51.320
This break, we're going to do a segment of a bunch of Mr. T songs, because Mr. T rocks.

38:51.320 --> 38:54.320
And I'm not talking about I pity the fool, but I'm talking about

38:54.320 --> 38:56.320
I pity the fool who tastes my gold chain.

38:56.320 --> 38:58.560
about that other Mr. T, the one that we all know from

38:58.560 --> 38:59.560
We'll be back.

42:28.560 --> 42:32.720
So

42:32.720 --> 42:36.720
So

42:36.720 --> 42:40.720
So

42:40.720 --> 42:44.720
So

42:44.720 --> 42:48.720
So

42:48.720 --> 42:52.720
So

42:52.720 --> 42:56.720
So

43:56.720 --> 44:09.720
For the step squad of Orange Lounge, this media stops on the phone with the winners at the site PS.

44:09.720 --> 44:19.720
GTPO.

44:19.720 --> 44:26.520
I mean, all right, we're back and you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 69.

44:26.520 --> 44:29.880
And as promised, we're going to get into a cage match here very shortly, but I thought

44:29.880 --> 44:31.640
this was worth talking about this week.

44:31.640 --> 44:35.480
Loki, I know you've been somewhat involved in this.

44:35.480 --> 44:41.400
There's been this movement going on lately, MTV is holding this contest, and they are

44:41.400 --> 44:46.680
naming the best game of the millennium.

44:46.680 --> 44:49.580
Now of course we're only three years into the millennium, but they're going to name

44:49.580 --> 44:52.380
the best game of the whole damn millennium anyway.

44:52.380 --> 44:54.700
Up for nomination, DDR.

44:54.700 --> 44:58.220
This is an MTV and electronic gaming monthly.

44:58.220 --> 45:01.380
Also up for nomination, Halo.

45:01.380 --> 45:04.740
The Final Fantasy series, the Super Mario series, yada yada yada.

45:04.740 --> 45:10.180
Loki, tell us more about what's been going on trying to flood the channels with votes

45:10.180 --> 45:11.180
for DDR.

45:11.180 --> 45:13.940
That's really stupid.

45:13.940 --> 45:20.100
MTV is, you know, they're really genius and they allowed people to vote more than once

45:20.100 --> 45:25.620
for their game. So obviously that opens it up for, hey, let's make a script and I'm going

45:25.620 --> 45:29.740
to go ahead and vote for my game millions of times. And so that's what everyone did,

45:29.740 --> 45:36.040
at least the people that are voting for Halo and DDR. So this went on for like two days

45:36.040 --> 45:39.580
and then finally MTV closed their polls and they're like, okay, find out the results on

45:39.580 --> 45:45.820
January 2nd. Okay, so that, we thought, okay, they're done. So, pretty much, you know, Halo

45:45.820 --> 45:50.180
and DDR are going to win, you know, according to that. And DDR was in the lead. Then for

45:50.180 --> 45:53.300
some reason, people thought you could still vote after the polls closed. So, they kept

45:53.300 --> 45:58.420
doing it and doing it and doing it. And finally, they opened the polls again, supposedly changing

45:58.420 --> 46:03.900
their script or their, like, webpage or whatever, their submission thing, so that you can't,

46:03.900 --> 46:08.740
you know, do this multiple voting thing. Yet, it's still getting through. So, to be honest,

46:08.740 --> 46:10.960
I don't know what they're doing and I just don't care anymore.

46:10.960 --> 46:14.480
I was doing it in the beginning, you know, helping out, but now I just don't care.

46:14.480 --> 46:15.480
It's stupid.

46:15.480 --> 46:19.720
Well, if you want to help out, you can go over to MTV.com and do the votes that way,

46:19.720 --> 46:24.240
or you can keep an eye on DDR Freak because the admin of DDR Freak, J-Dog, has been writing

46:24.240 --> 46:27.000
several scripts to kind of auto-vote.

46:27.000 --> 46:31.760
So if you want to, you know, help DDR out and make it the number one game, go ahead

46:31.760 --> 46:32.760
and do it.

46:32.760 --> 46:36.460
But, you know, I could give a shit because MTV polls suck.

46:36.460 --> 46:39.500
I have seen this exact same thing happen before, exact same thing.

46:39.500 --> 46:45.200
An artist I really like a lot was up one year as a nominee for the MTV Viewer's Choice Awards,

46:45.200 --> 46:47.300
and they did voting online, same way.

46:47.300 --> 46:49.840
But this time you could see the results as you were voting.

46:49.840 --> 46:54.860
And somebody wrote on the web board for this particular artist, somebody wrote a script

46:54.860 --> 46:55.860
that would auto-vote.

46:55.860 --> 47:00.740
It wasn't like a program, but it was a web page that would refresh like 10 frames over

47:00.740 --> 47:02.660
and over again with the voting page.

47:02.660 --> 47:06.900
So we had this artist up to 98% of the vote for the Viewer's Choice Award.

47:06.900 --> 47:12.220
And the day of the MTV Awards, they posted a message on there that said, well, this person

47:12.220 --> 47:15.500
won the web vote, but we're only going to count the phone votes for the real award.

47:15.500 --> 47:18.800
So stay tuned tonight and see who wins, and a completely different person won.

47:18.800 --> 47:22.300
So MTV, you know what, if they want to just throw out the web votes, they'll do it.

47:22.300 --> 47:26.500
And what they're going to do is they're going to keep all of the advertising dollars for

47:26.500 --> 47:27.740
all those banners that loaded.

47:27.740 --> 47:32.100
Because think of it, every time you refresh that page, that's like three more banners

47:32.100 --> 47:36.180
average because MTV.com is full of logos, three more banners that load. So you vote

47:36.180 --> 47:42.860
a million times, you're giving MTV a thousand dollars from all that refreshing. So, kind

47:42.860 --> 47:46.820
of something to think about. At least that's the way I look at it. You have something to

47:46.820 --> 47:52.980
say, Pixie? Well, you wanted something more pathetic than that? The search for Miss Applebottom

47:52.980 --> 48:00.740
on VH1, where they're searching for the woman with the perfect butt. And the choice host

48:00.740 --> 48:07.740
of that? J-Lo? Nelly. This Nelly? Not this Nelly. Nelly with the bandaid on his eye.

48:08.940 --> 48:13.720
It's getting hot in here. It's so pathetic, there was nothing but big booty black girls

48:13.720 --> 48:20.720
and adult models there. I would have thought J-Lo would have been a judge on that show.

48:24.220 --> 48:30.220
She has the queen of all butts. I have the king, she has the queen. I have a king-sized

48:30.220 --> 48:37.580
are you the flying duchess yes because it's so wide i'm like i like sarah ferguson i have

48:37.580 --> 48:45.020
like a wide ass yeah i like how you throw that unlike sarah ferguson well you know what's

48:45.020 --> 48:49.300
weird is that they're going to be doing that partridge family redo pretty soon too i mean

48:49.300 --> 48:56.540
mtv aren't you in that vh1 is a network i'll watch occasionally because they actually play

48:56.540 --> 49:02.160
some good videos. This is how I know I'm getting old, because I prefer VH1 to MTV. The music

49:02.160 --> 49:05.980
on MTV I don't like, as much as I like the music on VH1. It's like, oh God, am I getting

49:05.980 --> 49:11.280
old? Because I prefer the station that plays things that skew a little bit older, like

49:11.280 --> 49:15.000
Sting and Coldplay and- Sarah McLachlan.

49:15.000 --> 49:19.720
Sarah McLachlan, and bands that don't play on MTV a lot. I'm like, am I getting old?

49:19.720 --> 49:23.180
So this is one reason I don't care about the MTV poll, is that I don't watch MTV, so I

49:53.180 --> 49:57.180
Are you willing to bet that Grand Theft Auto Vice City wins, no matter what?

49:57.180 --> 50:01.180
That's the thing, because it's trendy to like a Grand Theft Auto Vice City,

50:01.180 --> 50:07.180
and it would be like avant-garde for MTV to give the award, because we're going to give the award to a controversial game

50:07.180 --> 50:11.180
where you shoot hookers, where you fuck the women and then blow their heads off.

50:11.180 --> 50:15.180
That's going to be the best game of the millennium. That sums up 2003 right there.

50:15.180 --> 50:19.180
Grand Theft Auto III.

50:19.180 --> 50:21.180
It's just going to be summary targeted.

50:23.180 --> 50:25.180
I just don't like MTV.

50:27.180 --> 50:30.180
Well, there you have it. There is that poll and it exists if you want to go vote in it.

50:30.180 --> 50:32.180
You know, it would be nice to see DDR win something.

50:32.180 --> 50:34.180
But I think people out there are thinking that,

50:34.180 --> 50:40.180
Oh my gods! If DDR wins this poll and we get exposure on MTV, the Konami is going to make a new mix.

50:40.180 --> 50:41.180
6.

50:41.180 --> 50:49.940
Okay, the exposure of DDR to anybody on MTV was that stupid fucking Wade Robson commercial.

50:49.940 --> 50:51.580
That's all they fucking know.

50:51.580 --> 50:55.700
All they know is Afro Man and fucking all his stupid shit like, oh you have to go up

50:55.700 --> 50:58.540
and do it and to the side.

50:58.540 --> 51:01.180
I'm like, I don't want DDR on MTV.

51:01.180 --> 51:03.020
I don't want those people playing my game.

51:03.020 --> 51:05.520
Stay off my dance pad.

51:05.520 --> 51:06.520
Get off.

51:06.520 --> 51:08.380
I like those little girls that come in.

51:08.380 --> 51:12.380
The new thing is going to be karaoke revolution.

51:12.380 --> 51:14.180
Goody fucking goody.

51:14.180 --> 51:15.940
No styling has something he wants to say?

51:19.500 --> 51:21.020
No.

51:21.020 --> 51:24.660
Well, don't tease me like that.

51:24.660 --> 51:26.260
Oh, but Rob, you love to be teased.

51:26.260 --> 51:28.780
I do like to be teased.

51:28.780 --> 51:30.780
We'll talk a little more about karaoke revolution

51:30.780 --> 51:33.620
and things like that after this cage match we're going to have.

51:33.620 --> 51:36.700
Now, as I promised, tonight is a little different of a cage

51:36.700 --> 51:43.700
match and because it's a different cage match we have different music.

51:44.340 --> 51:49.700
So tonight we are having what's called a reverse cage match. The reason why we are having a

51:49.700 --> 51:55.580
reverse cage match tonight is because Jamie left for Alabama and assumed that her song

51:55.580 --> 52:02.580
would win for two more weeks and forgot to give me two more songs for cage match. Or

52:02.580 --> 52:05.580
Or if she told me, I forgot, and it's my bad.

52:05.580 --> 52:10.580
So what we've decided we do tonight is we table the cage match, because we all know Loki's song probably would have won again anyway,

52:10.580 --> 52:14.580
because he won last week with Battle Without Honor or Humanity, the 88 severed lens mix,

52:14.580 --> 52:17.580
which we'll play later in the show for those who...

52:17.580 --> 52:19.580
Oh shit, no I don't.

52:19.580 --> 52:23.580
I guess we won't be playing it later in the show, because I don't have the MP3 of it.

52:23.580 --> 52:26.580
Oh my God, it's a cheeseburger!

52:26.580 --> 52:30.580
Anyway, I guess I can't play because I don't have the MP3 of it,

52:30.580 --> 52:36.580
Unless somebody in the chat room I send it to can send it back to me, because it was on Loki's old computer, which is not operative right now.

52:36.580 --> 52:41.580
Anyway, tonight in the reverse cage match, this is what's going to happen.

52:41.580 --> 52:49.580
Loki and I between, we're each going to put in two songs that we believe are some of the worst things we've ever heard.

52:49.580 --> 52:53.580
And they're going to be Bamani or Dance Mania related in some way.

52:53.580 --> 53:02.580
And you guys will vote for the absolute worst song that you heard, and the loser will be banned from Orange Lounge Radio indefinitely.

53:02.580 --> 53:08.580
You will never hear this song on the station ever again. Ever. We will ban the song. It's gone.

53:08.580 --> 53:14.580
Alright, so Lucky and I are going to pick two songs each, so you're going to vote for the song you hate the most.

53:14.580 --> 53:19.580
The song you want to leave tonight. Alright, so that's the reverse cage match.

53:19.580 --> 53:24.580
instead of picking a song to win and be in rotation all week long, you're going to pick for a song to lose and be banned indefinitely.

53:24.580 --> 53:31.580
Alright, so first up is going to be my first pick, and it's actually a song from Dancing Stage Fever.

53:31.580 --> 53:37.580
How exciting. This is a song that you can actually dance to in Dancing Stage Fever, so even if it gets banned from the station indefinitely,

53:37.580 --> 53:41.580
you'll still be able to play it if you really, really want to.

53:41.580 --> 53:48.580
Here's my pick for tonight's reverse cage match to ban from the station. It's the Spice Girls with Wannabe. Enjoy.

53:48.580 --> 53:51.460
You'll tell me what you want, what I really really want

53:51.460 --> 53:53.180
No, tell me what you really really want

53:53.180 --> 53:55.320
I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want

53:55.320 --> 53:57.200
No, tell me what you want, what you really really want

53:57.200 --> 53:59.260
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna

53:59.260 --> 54:01.620
I'm gonna really really really wanna

54:01.620 --> 54:02.580
So you say ahhh

54:02.580 --> 54:06.140
If you want my future, forget my past

54:06.140 --> 54:10.880
If you wanna get with me, we'll be making ministry

54:10.880 --> 54:15.240
Now don't go wasting, my precious time

54:15.240 --> 54:20.240
Sean, get your actually every week to be just fine

54:20.240 --> 54:22.240
I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want

54:22.240 --> 54:24.240
Don't tell me what you want, what you really really want

54:24.240 --> 54:29.240
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna Really really really wanna do the thing

54:29.240 --> 54:33.240
If you wanna be my lover You gotta have with my friends

54:33.240 --> 54:38.240
Making life forever Friendship never ends

54:38.240 --> 54:42.240
If you wanna be my lover You have got to give

54:42.240 --> 54:46.420
Taking it too easy but that's the way it is

54:46.420 --> 54:48.620
If you wanna be my lover

54:48.620 --> 54:50.940
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta

54:50.940 --> 54:52.840
Make the last word for the Lord

54:52.840 --> 55:04.840
Come you body down and wind it all around

55:04.840 --> 55:15.360
If you want to be my lover

55:15.360 --> 55:22.600
Alright though, song number one in tonight's reverse cage match for worst song ever to

55:22.600 --> 55:24.840
be banned from the station was Spice Girls with Wannabe.

55:24.840 --> 55:29.000
Let's go around and see what people thought of that and rate it on a scale of one to ten.

55:29.000 --> 55:30.000
Pixie Dust.

55:30.000 --> 55:46.000
All I gotta say is, I have ScarySpy's hair, so I love that song. Damn it. Reminds me of my youth, you fuckface. Damn it! Fuck you, I want that song.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
It's my favorite song, so a one.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Well, if you give it a one, that means you think it's bad.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
Oh, I gave it a ten!

55:51.000 --> 55:52.000
Alright.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
I thought we were doing it in reverse.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
Okay.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
I thought you were doing it in reverse.

56:55.000 --> 56:59.600
said that he'd like to bang about three out of five of them, but he'd rather they keep

56:59.600 --> 57:03.000
the dick in their mouth so he doesn't have to hear them.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
Zero!

57:04.000 --> 57:05.000
Bum-bye!

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
Alright.

57:06.000 --> 57:07.000
Rob Zink?

57:07.000 --> 57:08.000
Uh, no.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.000
Oh!

57:09.000 --> 57:10.680
It's a Zink for him, not for me.

57:10.680 --> 57:14.080
My vote is be glad it wasn't spice up your life, okay?

57:14.080 --> 57:15.080
I know that whole song.

57:15.080 --> 57:16.320
So I give it a two.

57:16.320 --> 57:18.520
I know that whole song, and I love that whole song.

57:18.520 --> 57:21.520
Up next, Loki, your first pick, because we're each putting in two songs tonight because

57:21.520 --> 57:24.000
Jamie's not here, so we're going to have four songs to pick from.

57:24.000 --> 57:29.000
Uh, Loki, what's your first song tonight that you're going to nominate to be banned from Orange Lounge forever?

57:30.000 --> 57:34.000
This song is like the worst song ever. You guys seem to like it, so you know what? I hope it's gone.

57:35.000 --> 57:38.000
Leave. It's done. This is lame.

57:39.000 --> 57:45.000
I give you fucking Holic. Vote for Holic, you bitch! You fucking bitch and whiny, you can't vote for Holic. Vote for it now!

57:45.000 --> 57:52.680

57:52.680 --> 57:58.280
of people trying to vote for it in the cage match so here we go song number two to be banned tonight

57:58.280 --> 58:00.280
This is Tack with Holik.

58:58.280 --> 59:28.240
Alright, that was song number two to be voted for eviction from Orange Lodge Radio tonight.

59:28.240 --> 59:32.880

59:32.880 --> 59:37.200

Alright.

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:02.760
Now I guess it's tag.

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:03.760
Can you guys see more?

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:04.760

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:06.760

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:07.760
Cause it sucks.

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:10.760
It's the same damn song over and over again.

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:15.760
He thought he was all cool by his, you know, doing it in seven, four, you know, measures,

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:16.760
whatever.

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:17.760
Sucks.

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:18.760
Lame.

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:21.760
Lame song sounds like every single other song is done.

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:22.760
Alright.

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:30.440
I give it a nine because I just not going to give it a ten because I'm just that big

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:33.240
of a prank.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:36.880
Song number three tonight is my pick and it's a Dance Mania pick.

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:43.600
This comes from Dance Mania EX1 and it's a cover song and it's a cover of a song that

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:48.320
was really famous because it was in a movie once and the name of the group that covers

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:54.400
it is called Bushida, and this is their cover of My Heart Will Go On. My pick for tonight

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:58.400
If you're done with the station, my heart will go on.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.400
Enjoy!

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:44.400
In my, in my dreams, I see you, I feel you That's how I want to go on

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:53.200
Before I cross the distance, I'll stay deep between my

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:59.200
Ears come to shove you along

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:14.200
Wherever you are, I believe that the heart is gone

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:34.200
No, no, you are from the dark and you're here in my heart and my heart is gone and gone

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:51.200
I can touch you sometime, I'll just fall for our time

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:58.200
And I won't let you be with me, I won't let you be with me

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:31.200
It's covered of Blaine Dion. It needs to fucking DIE, BASTARD!

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:36.200
I hate Blaine Dion, so that gets a zero on my list.

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.200
Alright, Angel.

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:41.200
No, DIE, one.

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:44.200
No, Skylin.

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:49.200
I give it a zero. 0.1, I don't like this song at all.

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:53.200
Alright, Magus Zero. Goodbye.

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.200
Uh, Loki.

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:58.200
It gets a 10 because that movie was so sad.

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:06.200
Oh my god, he's so gone and she's so sad because her love died and became a popsicle.

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:08.200
I'm so alone!

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:16.200
I am the world's greatest singer.

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:23.200
And I give my song a ten because I have six crannies and you have none.

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:26.200
Because I have the words, great to see none.

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:28.200
Next thing you know, Celine Dion Hot Pockets.

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:29.200
Alright.

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:32.200
Loki, the final pick in tonight's reverse cage match.

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.200
For song to be banned from Orange Lounge forever.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.200
What did you pick?

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:39.200
No, they saved my other song from being put in here because it probably would have gotten

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:42.200
put off but now you get to be subjected to it even more.

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:48.200
The song I was going to pick was Eddie Murphy's Party All the Time, but we like that song.

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:54.200
So instead, we've got Nancy and the Boys, a wonderful speed group who sucks because

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:57.200
it's speed music, doing Complicated.

01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:59.200
So eat this.

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:03.200
Alright, from Speed 10, this is Nancy and the Boys with Complicated.

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.200
Enjoy.

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:36.200
I can't wait to see you again

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:38.200
I can't wait to see you again

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.200
Chill out, watch the young poor

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:40.200
Lay back, all the time you poor

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:42.200
And if you could only let it be

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:43.200
You'll see

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.200
I like you the way you are

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:46.200
When we're sliding in your car

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:48.200
And you're talking to me one-on-one

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.200
You've got somebody else

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.200
Everyone else

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.200
Watch them back, you can laugh

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:53.200
Try and fool, look like fool to me

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.200
Tell me

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.200
What you're gonna get

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:56.200
So complicated

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:57.200
I see the way you're acting

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:58.200
I'm somebody else, get me frustrated

01:05:58.200 --> 01:05:59.200
I'm not just used to you

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.200
And you're all in your club

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:01.200
And you're great

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.200
And you take care

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:03.200
And you start hating too

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.200
No, no, no

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:07.200
You come over, I know

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:09.200
Check out, like yourself, I know

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.200
Where you are and where it's at, you see

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.200
You make me laugh out, rain looks like a pro

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:15.200
Take off all your crappy clothes

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:16.200
You know what I'm doing

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:17.200
And you want the music

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.200
Come on, come on now

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.200
Everyone else, watch them back

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:21.200
You can laugh, smile and cool

01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:22.200
You look like a fool to me

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:23.200
Tell me what you know

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:25.200
This ain't something I can tell you

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:27.200
I hate it all when you're acting like nobody else

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:28.200
Get me frustrated

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:29.200
I trust this you

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:30.200
And you fall and you fall and you break

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:31.200
And you say what you get and you say it

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:22.120
Oh my God, I'm so glad we did this tonight.

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:25.760
The chat room reactions to these songs are fucking priceless.

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:26.760
This is great.

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:29.260
We've got to do this again.

01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:33.260
Which classic lines is, she sounds like a meth addict?

01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:36.260
How are you doing, Andrew?

01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:40.260
Oh, would you say, Loki, play it again?

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:42.260
Oh, play it again. No.

01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:46.260
All right, your thoughts, Nancy and the boys, complicated, speed 10.

01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:47.260
What do you think, Pixie Dust?

01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:51.260
I heard that when I was over at Garrett's house when he first got speed 10.

01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:55.260
We just rolled on the floor laughing from that crap.

01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:59.260
It's, unfortunately, better than Avril, but, you know.

01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:02.260
Zero. Zero.

01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:05.260
Alright, that's 7-1-10, she gives it a zero.

01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:10.260
Angel, your thoughts on Nancy and the boys? Complicated.

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:16.260
Who the fuck either turned up or changed the speed on the record player to where it's like,

01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:25.260
Who scratched my Avril Lavigne CD? I mean, mine? Um, maybe it was Bixby's.

01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:32.260
Fuck you! I don't have Avril! I have fucking Nancy and the boys, get it right, bitch!

01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:35.260
Mmmm, no.

01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:37.260
Let's go one to ten, Angel.

01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:38.260
Oh yeah, right.

01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:40.260
One being low and ten being high.

01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:42.260
One, bitch!

01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:44.260
No Stalin, your thoughts on Nancy and the boys?

01:08:44.260 --> 01:09:11.380
I give this song a 10 and I'm telling you why, I almost peed my pants laughing at the

01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:14.900
chat room reactions during that song, and that is worth something.

01:09:14.900 --> 01:09:20.060
Let's see, Rob, you almost peed your pants in Megas or you're supposed to die?

01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:22.580
And I almost peed my pants on a dead Megas, so what?

01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:25.740
That could be a fetish film.

01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:27.660
Alright, here are your choices.

01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:29.820
Remember tonight is a reverse cage match.

01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:34.180
The song that wins, quote unquote, if we can call it that, will be banned from Orange Lounge

01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:36.380
for all eternity.

01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:37.380
Here we go.

01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:38.420
Here's a recap.

01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:40.880
You vote for the song you want to ban.

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:53.280
Here we go, Spice Girls with Wannabe, choice number one.

01:09:53.280 --> 01:10:04.880
Song number two you can vote for tonight is kind of surprising, but it's Tack with Hollick.

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:15.840
All right, song number two you can vote for tonight is from Dance Mia X1.

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:20.000
It's a cover of Celine Dion with My Heart Will Go On.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:39.720
Song number 4 you can vote for tonight from Speed 10 Nancy and the Boys with Complicated

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:54.080
Alright, there you go, please vote now, those votes come with a private message to me, Sky,

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:55.080
in the chatroom.

01:10:55.080 --> 01:11:02.240
Alright, oh wow, I'm loving the reactions, they're like, no, don't do the recaps, don't

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:05.720
play them again, please, for the love of God, alright, we'll tally those votes momentarily.

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:10.000
No, you had an interesting opinion on Nancy and the Boys' Complicated.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000
I loved it.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000
It's beautiful.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.440
Why did you love it and think it's beautiful?

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.320
Because it's funny.

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.800
It sounds like the Chipmunks.

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:21.000
Yeah, why do people buy Chipmunks albums?

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
This is what I want to know.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.240
The Chipmunks, maybe were funny in the 50s, but they're not funny now.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:30.160
Because they're only two bucks.

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:32.160
It's cheap entertainment like you, Rob.

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:39.160
Because all you have to do is slow down the song and it's the real song.

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:47.920
Nancy and the boys should die of chlamydia from what I understand.

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:51.560
A song can't die of chlamydia, AIDS maybe, but not chlamydia.

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:52.560
You know what?

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.400
We should send them to elephant bar and they can die of hepatitis.

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:58.520
Hey, if there's a tie tonight, you guys, we'll kick both songs off.

01:11:58.520 --> 01:11:59.520
How's that sound?

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:11.520
There's a tie tonight. Guess what other song gets booted off? I think I see some votes

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:16.180
coming in for Holiks, so you never know. My Holiks could win, we'll see. And that Jamie

01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:20.000
is going to be a pissed off woman if she hears the Holiks got banned from the station. She's

01:12:50.000 --> 01:13:08.880
time magazine has named as game of the year for 2003 karaoke revolution. Why? Why? What

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:12.680
do you guys think? I'd like to hear Loki's thoughts on karaoke revolution having played

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:42.240
this? Do you think it's possibly because it's innovative and people like these innovative

01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:44.640
games and they think it's going to start a revolution?

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:49.240
Isn't that innovative? Oh yeah, karaoke was just invented by Konami!

01:13:49.240 --> 01:14:00.240
But what about the iToy? I think the iToy is way more innovative than karaoke revolution.

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:05.280
Yeah, but you can't sing with poorly recorded cover artists.

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:08.200
Hey, one of those poorly recorded cover artists is one of Angel's friends.

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.200
And a point.

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:12.200
Asshole!

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.200
God!

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.200
Two bucks.

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:17.200
Alright.

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:18.200
Not like me.

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:22.200
So, so Time magazine names karaoke revolution...

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:24.200
Max 2?

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:26.200
Never got named game of the anything.

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:27.200
Ultra Mix?

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:29.200
Won't get named game of the anything.

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:32.200
DER's just getting shit on left and right.

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:33.200
It may win MTV's poll.

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:35.200
Oh goodie.

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:39.200
What about Enter the Matrix? That was an awesome game.

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:41.200
I don't believe a rat about that one.

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.200
I guess it was better than the movies, right?

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:44.200
I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:48.200
It was better than Karaoke Revolution.

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:50.200
Karaoke Revolution is kind of retarded.

01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:54.200
All it is, is you're basically just taking your home console and singing with it.

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:58.200
Poorly. Singing poorly with it.

01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:01.200
That is just me. And a lot of other people.

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:03.280
All you're doing is encouraging them.

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.280
God damn it.

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:07.720
If there's anything in this world we need, it's encouraging stupid people.

01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:09.120
Why do we need to encourage them?

01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:10.120
God damn it.

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:14.040
You won't let the stupid Chinese lady just stop asking you for samples.

01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:16.400
No, you have to go and interject.

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:19.880
You have to go, oh yes, I will take a sample.

01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:21.960
We keep the rats out of those.

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:23.680
I will ask them now.

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:25.280
And so, these won't stop.

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:27.520
It's the same with this God damn thing.

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:33.560
sometimes weren't meant to sing. Just the fact. Just don't sing. And this gives them

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:37.840
a false hope that someday they'll become a singing superstar. And in the meantime, they

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:46.840
have to torture us with their horrible renditions of crap. Including complicated. Lame. No.

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:53.680
Game of the year, I think not. But you seemed to have a good time when you played this game.

01:15:53.680 --> 01:16:11.420
game? Oh yeah, great time was had by me, not. Okay. Alright, Pixie Dust. This game encourages

01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:15.860
my Filipino relatives to go and buy an Xbox and play Karaoke Revolution. Actually, it's

01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:19.260
on the PS2, dear. Oh, PS2. I thought it was on Xbox, for some reason. No, Xbox is Ultra

01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:25.260
I bet you anything that Xbox will get a karaoke revolution, if it sells well on PS2.

01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:31.260
It encourages my aunts to go, oh, that's karaoke, oh shit, ok, we'll go get that, and we'll

01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:36.260
get some wine and beer and smoke glass and fight cocks all day long.

01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:37.260
Yeah.

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:38.260
Filipino relatives.

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:43.260
They say, do you go bite cocks?

01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:44.260
Fight them.

01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:45.260
Oh, fight cocks.

01:16:45.260 --> 01:16:46.260
Cock fighting.

01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:51.260
What was this kind of blowjob revolution or something like that, you know?

01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:55.260
Didn't we have a list list like that one week where we were deciding what needs a Bamani game?

01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:56.260
And I want to say something...

01:16:56.260 --> 01:16:59.260
Yeah, I want to say Beat Your Meat Mania won that, actually.

01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:02.260
I think it did.

01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:07.260
Anyway, who knows what revolution Konami will try to start next.

01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:11.260
Okay, we're going to take another break here, and when we come back, we'll announce the winner of the cage match.

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:13.260
I have to take a break to tally the votes.

01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:16.620
We have more votes tonight in tonight's cage match than I've ever seen in a cage match

01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:22.380
ever, which makes me think we need to do a reverse cage match every week.

01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:23.380
Just kidding.

01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:24.380
Just kidding.

01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:25.380
Don't kill me.

01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:26.380
Don't kill me.

01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:27.380
Yeah.

01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:28.380
We'll end up having no songs on the station.

01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:29.380
I'll just keep voting for Holly.

01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:35.540
Also, are we going to get into this add-on crap later?

01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:36.540
Absolutely.

01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:39.380
When we come back, we're going to talk a little more about Ultramix, since it is coming out

01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:41.080
this week after all.

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:45.020
In this break, just random potpourri stuff, couple songs from Guitar Freaks and something

01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:48.860
from DDR that I rather like and I know some of you listening like it too.

01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:54.500
So enjoy these good songs after that little orgy of bad stuff and we'll be right back.

01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:58.100
Of course it's all relative, you could hate all three of these songs but, well, sucks

01:17:58.100 --> 01:17:59.100
to be you.

01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:00.100
We'll be back.

01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:15.660
I get an eight-niner to scramble I got my car all set to scramble

01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:21.540
Don't really know where I'm from so I put my foot down on the pedal

01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:27.540
I got pedal to the metal Rolled down the highway just like a fireball

01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:31.540
Climb like the stairs, don't stop the fire, boy, burn it high to the floor

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:36.540
Get those tomatoes, don't stop the fire, boy, burn the sky like it's snow

01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:10.540
I'm gonna get it!

01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:24.900
I'm going to get it!

01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:25.900
It's great, man!

01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:32.900
But when she caught his eye, ain't no man could fight those demons

01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:39.900
He knew he'd have to try to let love in

01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:46.900
Not to let him know, but to try again

01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:50.900
But when she caught his eye, ain't no man could fight those demons

01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:53.900
He knew he had to try to make love in

01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:57.900
Not to let her know, she was in the mood for talking

01:19:57.900 --> 01:20:00.900
So then he began to play the game

01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:04.900
Before he knew it, he had told her how much he'd been hurting

01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:07.900
How he was hoping she was not the same

01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:10.900
Could you see the kind of way people are looking

01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:13.900
After all that's trying to be true to love

01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:17.900
And she said, boy, you don't have to love no more

01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:21.900
I'll give the love you need till you holler in the fair and see

01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:24.900
Like a love boy, I'm a fine lady

01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:27.900
You've been hard, so peaceful, but I am the cure

01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:30.900
When you wake up late, it's a dream

01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:34.900
See, boy, you know she still haunts me, at least

01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:37.900
This lady, you know what you found in me

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:40.900
As a lady, I'm the lady that can give you what you need

01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:44.900
Baby, I'm a fine lady that will never leave you lonely

01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:49.900
Yeah, but maybe this lady will find a baby from the other side, won't she?

01:20:49.900 --> 01:21:15.020
Let's get together, honey, honey, me and you, and do the things, oh, do the things that

01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:35.020
we like to do. Oh, do a little dance, make a little love. Get down to life, get down to life. Baby, babe, I need you. Same place, same town.

01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:39.020
Well, we can't have all the kids together

01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:44.020
And be so on my mind, oh

01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:48.020
You and I, baby, look

01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:52.020
Get down tonight, get down tonight, baby

01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:58.020
Get down, get down, get down, get down, get down tonight, baby

01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:35.020
said

01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:37.260

01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:44.020
winner or should i say loser of tonight's reverse cage match

01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:45.620
just out of curiosity

01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:49.420
what would you have voted for gang and what do you think is going to lose

01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:50.860
i'll tell you tonight's

01:22:50.860 --> 01:22:52.580
tonight's loser

01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:55.940
got seventy nine percent of the votes

01:22:55.940 --> 01:23:00.800
What do you think should lose and will lose?

01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:02.380
The second song.

01:23:02.380 --> 01:23:12.160
You think Holik should lose or will lose?

01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:21.500
The Slow One, the Titanic song.

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.480
Pixie Dust what do you think will be booted and what should be lost?

01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:30.480
You have just got on Jamie's bad side for saying Hollis will be banned, you fucker.

01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:33.960
Avril, or Nancy and the Boys.

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:34.960
Will be banned?

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:35.960
Will be banned.

01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:37.360
And what should be banned?

01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:38.360
What should be banned?

01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:39.360
Yeah.

01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:40.360
Fucking Titanic song.

01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:42.360
Fucking bitch.

01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:47.280
Angel, what song do you think got 79% of the vote tonight?

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:49.360
Probably the Avril Lavigne cover.

01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:50.360
Okay.

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.560
And what do you think should be?

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:57.240
you think it's rightfully so either that or the stupid Titanic song sorry all

01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:03.040
right Magus what will be booted off tonight what should sadly I think Holick

01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:06.720
will go all right you think Holick's gonna go tonight what do you think

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:11.480
should go definitely complicated should have gone but all right I have a

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:13.480
feeling it's gonna be Holick all right we'll see

01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:17.080
Maggie momentarily let me we'll kill you later what should go what do you think

01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:21.160
we're not expressing opinion just hard to go because it sucked actually we

01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:27.520
to remove alt-hack music from this station? Jamie will stab you for that. If Jamie's listening,

01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:35.520
she's going to come back and shove one of those ferrets right up your ass. Great. Alright,

01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:44.320
but in all seriousness, what do you think will be voted tonight? Holic? Okay, well I

01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:46.480
I already know who's losing.

01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:52.640
And with 79% of the vote, the song you...

01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:54.200
I'm sorry, what's going on over there?

01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:59.320
They're raping the ferrets, bastards.

01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:00.560
Don't play with the ferrets.

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:01.640
Jamie would be upset.

01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:02.480
All right.

01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:04.680
Yeah, don't play with the ferrets.

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:06.680
You're going to get beat up when Jamie comes back.

01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:07.180
That's all.

01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:08.760
And I'm the one who's going to be here,

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:12.360
because two of these bastards live in frickin' the Bay Area.

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:14.280
Bastards.

01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:15.280
Alright.

01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:16.280
What?

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:17.280
Repeat that.

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:19.280
Oh, it's the first or step.

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.280
Awesome.

01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:21.280
There's the off-step.

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:22.280
Okay, Rob.

01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:23.280
I'll quiet them down.

01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:24.280
Alright, yeah.

01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:34.280
Would you get those, would you get that, get them all uh, shutting up, please?

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:38.280
Alright, here we go.

01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:52.280
Tonight's loser, with 79% of the votes, is Complicated.

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:57.280
It is gone from the station forever.

01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:00.280
Hi, guys.

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:02.280
How's my little car screeching noise?

01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:04.280
All right.

01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:09.520
Okay, so complicated does get the boot from the station and you will never hear it on the station ever again

01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:12.120
Even if somebody is trying to play speed 10 in their entirety

01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:17.000
They must skip track one because you guys have voted complicated off of the station

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Yeah, I can strip now

01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:26.280
So in celebration pixie dust will be getting naked for you all right now. Oh, except the camps down tonight. What a bummer

01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:29.320
Where's the music what music? Oh

01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:34.280
Oh, I only had, my only stripping song was Complicated, so now I'm...

01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:37.440
Rob, you got your... Rob, you got your show yesterday at Rekacon.

01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:40.360
Wait, what? You got your show yesterday at Rekacon.

01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:44.520
I got... You got my... Oh yeah, I did, I did get a show yesterday at Rekacon.

01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:48.560
Arkadian is saying I should delete the file off my computer completely, and I

01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.560
think that is a good idea, so...

01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:55.120
Here we go, I'm going to, I'm currently going in, here's my DanceMania

01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:58.320
Speed 10 directory. I'm going to Complicated,

01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:01.900
I'm deleting it. It says do you want to send it through a cycle bin?

01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:06.600
And I just like yes, and now I'm minimizing my dose so I can get to the recital bin and here we go

01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:08.680
Wait for it. Wait for it. Oh

01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:17.480
There went yeah sound that little paper wrecking sound that was it complicated is off my hard drive and gone forever

01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:23.280
Gone forever

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:25.280
All right

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:26.280
I know that.

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:29.760
Loki, you had some stuff you wanted to share tonight with DDR Ultramix, since believe it

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:33.720
or not, we are a Bimani related show.

01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:36.840
They've already announced what the first song pack is going to be.

01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:43.440
It's a bunch of konami originals, starting with DJ Taka with Abyss from Fifth Mix, Naoki

01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:50.800
Burning the Floor from Fourth Mix, Tomosuke with Mind Parasite from Dance Maniacs, Mr.

01:28:50.800 --> 01:29:20.760
Alright, that is a little bit of money.

01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:52.760
Love Will mixed up with it.

01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:55.760
I should, if you want to grab your Fistoff soundtrack, go get it.

01:29:57.760 --> 01:29:59.760
We'll hear it in my eyes in the next break. How's that?

01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:01.760
We'll just save that for the next break.

01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:05.760
What do you guys think of this whole...

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:08.760
We've kind of brought this up on the show before, but now that it's coming to light,

01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:11.760
and the details are coming out, and the song list is coming out,

01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:15.760
what do you guys think of this whole paying $5 to download songs bit?

01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:17.760
What do you think of this? Good idea? Bad idea?

01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:21.760
I could pay $5 to have sex with Rob. Bad idea.

01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:28.760
Haha, you're not funny.

01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:33.760
Sucky, sucky $5, me love you long time.

01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:35.760
Okay.

01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:36.760
I pay you $5 to get away.

01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:42.760
What do you think of this idea? Does somebody have a serious comment here, Angel?

01:30:42.760 --> 01:31:01.760
No. We already pay enough for Bemani. If you're like Bemani addicts, like we all are, we already pay enough for getting 2DX in our houses and being able to play that because you have to buy another system for that and all that crap.

01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:28.320
Why even bother with Ultravix at all when you can just install Linux on an Xbox and

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:31.160
run StepMania?

01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:33.020
Let's assume not everyone knows how to do that.

01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:37.920
Not everyone's a nerdy genius like you, I guess.

01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:40.260
I use that term extremely loosely.

01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:41.260
Kind of like you.

01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:42.260
Ha ha ha.

01:31:42.260 --> 01:31:43.260
Just kidding.

01:31:43.260 --> 01:31:45.260
Who's the loose one?

01:31:45.260 --> 01:31:46.260
I'm just kidding.

01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:47.260
I'm kidding.

01:31:47.260 --> 01:31:48.860
I love you, Janae.

01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:50.780
Pixie dust, don't get pouty with me.

01:31:50.780 --> 01:31:52.660
I'm going to come show you some love, Pixie dust.

01:31:52.660 --> 01:31:53.660
I'm going to show you some love.

01:31:53.660 --> 01:31:54.660
I love you.

01:31:54.660 --> 01:31:58.220
I'm going to put my head on your bosom.

01:31:58.220 --> 01:31:59.220
Somebody get the cam.

01:31:59.220 --> 01:32:00.220
I love you.

01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:12.000
be? I love you too. I'm so in love. Barrett love. Barrett love. I could put an Xbox on

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:24.760
those tits, man. What? Yeah, it's good shopping. I love you. I love you too. Bastard.

01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:30.160
I know you, of all people, love to pay to download things. I want to hear your thoughts

01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:40.480
on the $5 for 5 songs bit. It's just $5. I'd just do it. If I had the Xbox version or whatever,

01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:47.120
I might download it just so I can rip them. I don't see a problem with paying $5 for 5

01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:51.560
songs. It's not that expensive for just a one-time purchase. It's just like an add-on

01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:28.000
to buy the game or not. I probably will because we normally buy the game but then I rip the

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:32.900
songs and play them on my mind. I actually think I would buy the expansion

01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:37.000
pack too but the problem is I don't own an Xbox and I still have higher things on my

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:41.320
priority list to get even with DDR coming out. I'm like, I need a new processor for

01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:45.800
my computer so I can play Final Fantasy 11. I need a bigger hard drive for my MP3s. I

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:52.760
I need to buy a hooker. You bought me last night Rob. I'm sorry. You're from the 99 cent

01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:59.760
hooker store. I can afford that. I'm sorry. She had to raise her prices due to inflation

01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:09.520
in the breasts. Not like that mom and that baby huh Rob? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh come on

01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:13.820
you're not going to tell them about that? Why don't you tell her? You tell her so much

01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:17.820
No, I won't because now Loki is saying no, so never mind.

01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:19.820
No, don't listen to Loki, I never do.

01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:30.820
Well, we were coming out of the grocery store, going back to the car and this mom comes out with the kid in the cart and all of a sudden Loki responds with,

01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:37.820
Oh look, they sold the kid or something and the kid was all happy and whatever. We all busted up laughing.

01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:39.820
Alright, Loki wants to correct some things.

01:34:39.820 --> 01:34:41.820
Go ahead, correct it because I don't...

01:34:41.820 --> 01:34:47.580
I saw the stupid woman who looked homely with her stupid baby in her car, pushing her around

01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:52.980
picking up cans or whatever, and then I'm like, aw, how cute, she's gonna go sell her

01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:53.980
baby.

01:34:53.980 --> 01:34:57.540
And the baby was all happy to be rid of her crack whore mom.

01:34:57.540 --> 01:34:58.540
Alright.

01:34:58.540 --> 01:35:00.980
Okay, um, wow.

01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:09.500
What else is going on in the Beaumonti world?

01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:13.380
what's going on in the Sim scene? Anything new in the Sim world? Why don't you give us

01:35:13.380 --> 01:35:23.660
some of your Sim update of the week? DDR Maniacs, this site came up, yippee. And on ddramerica.com

01:35:23.660 --> 01:35:28.900
or whatever, your BitTorrent site, you can find the wonderful Dancing Stage Fever songs,

01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:38.580
which I played today, and they suck. Surprise, surprise. The end. That's it, nothing else

01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:39.580
What's going on?

01:35:39.580 --> 01:35:40.580
Nothing.

01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:41.580
All right.

01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:49.340
We're going to take a quick break, and when we come back, we're going to do the FUs of

01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:50.340
the week.

01:35:50.340 --> 01:35:55.420
So, send those on over to Private Message to Sky in the chat room, and we'll be reading

01:35:55.420 --> 01:35:57.700
those right after this quick break.

01:35:57.700 --> 01:36:00.060
And all three of these songs have something in common.

01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:05.060
They may have a different artist's name, but they still have something very much in common.

01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:06.940
We'll be back.

01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:13.940
off with it in my eyes.

01:36:36.940 --> 01:36:39.940
You make me free

01:36:41.940 --> 01:36:47.940
They're the key of the need to live

01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:52.940
You are the light that makes me free

01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:59.940
They're not all the energy

01:36:59.940 --> 01:37:01.940
This is the end of the video.

01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:03.940
Thank you for watching.

01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:05.940
Please subscribe and like the video.

01:37:35.940 --> 01:37:39.940
I can feel it in the air

01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:47.940
In the air

01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:20.940
How could we stop at this moment, and write about what's been already done?

01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:24.600
How could we stop at this moment, and write about what's been already done?

01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:28.960
How could we stop at this moment, and write about what's been already done?

01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:33.020
How could we stop at this moment, and write about what's been already done?

01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:37.940
How could we stop at this moment, and write about what's been already done?

01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:41.120
How could we stop at this moment, and write about what's been already done?

01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:45.700
How could we stop at this moment, and write about what's been already done?

01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:58.700
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

01:41:58.700 --> 01:42:07.700
Alright, we're back, and it's about time to get in our favorite part of the show, the

01:42:07.700 --> 01:42:11.140
FUs of the Week, but first we want to make a few quick programming announcements.

01:42:11.140 --> 01:42:17.340
Vanilla Sky will not be on tomorrow night because I have to do some other errands and

01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:22.260
with work getting busy and all, I can't stay up late so I have to take Angel home tomorrow.

01:42:22.260 --> 01:42:23.260
Yeah.

01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:24.260
Loki.

01:42:24.260 --> 01:42:31.540
And unfortunately with my computer being the way it is in the situation I'm in, I'm unfortunately

01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:37.860
unable to do a live wire show this week and that kind of sucks too but I didn't plan for

01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:42.140
it to be this way and try and make sure it's not, but the computer is kind of up in the

01:42:42.140 --> 01:42:43.860
air right now.

01:42:43.860 --> 01:42:48.180
So instead, Vanilla Sky will be on Wednesday this week, so I'm going to move over to Wednesday

01:42:48.180 --> 01:42:50.620
this week since there won't be a new live wire this week.

01:42:50.620 --> 01:42:55.260
And tomorrow night, if we can get the computer hooked up tomorrow, I don't know, I'll play

01:42:55.260 --> 01:42:58.940
an old episode of live wire in an increased bit rate.

01:42:58.940 --> 01:43:05.700
So it'll be like a higher quality stream, so we'll do that tomorrow for Monday night.

01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:09.920
If we can't get that to happen, we'll re-run an old episode of Vanilla Sky and a new episode

01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:11.380
of Vanilla Sky on Wednesday this week.

01:43:11.380 --> 01:43:13.780
Power Up at the Volume, of course, on Tuesday.

01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:14.780
Re-run this week.

01:43:14.780 --> 01:43:15.780
Jamie is still in Alabama.

01:43:15.780 --> 01:43:20.700
She does get back on Tuesday, but we don't expect her to want to walk through the door

01:43:20.700 --> 01:43:23.220
and sign online first thing.

01:43:23.220 --> 01:43:26.380
She's probably going to want to sleep for a little while, so she'll be back next week

01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:27.380
though.

01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:28.540
She'll be back Sunday for sure.

01:43:28.540 --> 01:43:32.860
Season 4 of Orange Lawn's radio debuts this Sunday, and the catch was that we were going

01:43:32.860 --> 01:43:39.700
to go MP3 Pro on Sunday, but we'll get into that in the FUs of the week. Which it is now

01:43:39.700 --> 01:43:46.460
time for you guys. Here we go, we are going into the FUs of the week. I have to get a

01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:50.220
little bit old school this week with the FU music because of Loki's computer being down.

01:43:50.220 --> 01:44:06.020
I'm missing a few files, but we'll start it off.

01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:15.180
Jamie this week would like to give a big F.U. to stupid people and us, I don't know, stupid

01:44:15.180 --> 01:44:22.180
drivers and things that are pissing her off in Alabama, and I'm sure she misses all of

01:44:22.620 --> 01:44:29.620
us greatly. So that's Jamie's F-use for tonight, which I am entering on her behalf. Up next

01:44:30.180 --> 01:44:35.180
is Loki with his F-use. And he still has the Christmas speed music, I promise, two weeks

01:44:35.180 --> 01:44:42.180
I wish you would have thought of this when we did the cage match, huh?

01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:12.180
Wait an hour, wait in line for another hour, get a new processor and drive back.

01:45:12.180 --> 01:45:15.180
And then finally I tried my computer and my computer worked.

01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:21.180
My old computer, something happened in the motherboard when I was installing it, so that didn't work.

01:45:21.180 --> 01:45:25.180
So I go back to Fry's and go pick up a new motherboard and come back home.

01:45:25.180 --> 01:45:28.180
And yeah, I wasted four hours because of Fry's.

01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:29.180
So Fry's sucks.

01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:33.900
Then there was this guy today when I was driving on the road who was trying to scratch his

01:45:33.900 --> 01:45:39.740
ass or something while driving his beat up truck and was like swerving all over the road.

01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:44.100
Like practically like you know just driving in two lanes at once and stuff like that.

01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:46.980
So I hate people and they deserve to die.

01:45:46.980 --> 01:45:51.860
And um another thing was um fucking with people with cell phones because uh your cell phones

01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:54.740
are going to get taken away pretty soon and you're not going to be able to drive in your

01:45:54.740 --> 01:45:56.620
car with your cell phones.

01:45:56.620 --> 01:45:57.620
So guess what?

01:45:57.620 --> 01:45:59.620
You're gonna have to concentrate on the road now, huh?

01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:01.620
No!

01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:04.620
Two words, one word, compound, headset.

01:46:04.620 --> 01:46:11.620
So, I just, you know, I hate it, I hate you guys, you know, driving at cell phones, you suck.

01:46:11.620 --> 01:46:12.620
Too small!

01:46:12.620 --> 01:46:17.620
I also hate the old bitch that was driving in front of me that was driving like 35 miles an hour in a 50 mile an hour road.

01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:22.620
Uh, you suck and I yelled at you, so, yeah.

01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:26.620
Um, also, fuck you to 107.9, cause they really suck.

01:46:26.620 --> 01:46:32.620
I don't understand why you have to send interns to a stupid competition like that.

01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:34.620
They have no opinion whatsoever.

01:46:34.620 --> 01:46:38.620
All they were doing was promoting some god knows whatever concert and I forgot what it was.

01:46:38.620 --> 01:46:39.620
Good job on them.

01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:41.620
Hey, let's do the look.

01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:43.620
Good show sucks ass.

01:46:43.620 --> 01:46:52.620
So anyway, so they suck ass and the fact that they have 107.9 coming to promote their damn show, that's really sad.

01:46:52.620 --> 01:47:01.620
Then not only that, that civic guy had no, you know, comments whatsoever, no constructive comments about these people in the first place, so that sucks.

01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:08.620
Ooh. Ooh, cat fight.

01:47:38.620 --> 01:47:40.620
I have to figure that one out.

01:47:43.620 --> 01:47:47.620
What the hell is this? This is like some Australian guy singing this.

01:47:53.620 --> 01:47:57.620
Oh, crikey! It's Rudolph! He's going down in history!

01:47:57.620 --> 01:47:59.620
Oh, that's awful!

01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:08.620
I had lots of money this weekend and now it's all gone, more or less.

01:48:08.620 --> 01:48:16.620
I think I'm done for now.

01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:18.620
All right, my turn.

01:48:18.620 --> 01:48:23.140
Of course, we get to hear Lion Suki again, even though we played it in that break, which,

01:48:23.140 --> 01:48:25.380
by the way, was all a Kiriyama, but related things.

01:48:25.380 --> 01:48:31.740
Rick in my eyes, Dancer, Duvall, Lion Suki, all 2DX songs, too.

01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:36.940
My F.U. this week goes to live365.com, the lovely site that hosts our radio station.

01:48:36.940 --> 01:48:41.080
That MP3 Pro live shit was supposed to be rolled out at the end of October, and we're

01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:43.140
still waiting for it.

01:48:43.140 --> 01:48:52.140
I was hoping we could have a live MP3 Pro stream starting Sunday, but that ain't gonna happen. Why? Because Live365 can't fucking get things out on time.

01:48:52.140 --> 01:49:00.140
I hope we don't get the plug pulled for ranting on this on Live365, but hey, I'm entitled to my right of speech.

01:49:00.140 --> 01:49:08.140
I'm just a little upset. I'm also upset at them because they're promoting the MP3 Pro thing all over the site when it's supposed to be in beta still.

01:49:08.140 --> 01:49:16.140
It's not supposed to be something that was rolled out to everybody, and I think it's a piss-poor thing to do to roll it out when half the people can't use it, because the live software isn't rolled out yet.

01:49:16.140 --> 01:49:25.140
You guys suck that cock, cock and balls, and I hope you get your shit done soon before I come to wherever you're at and set your building on fire.

01:49:25.140 --> 01:49:27.140
He said come.

01:49:27.140 --> 01:49:28.140
Yeah, I said come.

01:49:28.140 --> 01:49:46.140
Um, let's see, my other FUs of the week go to, um, being single, because being single sucks, and, um, my other FU goes to my job, because as much as I love my job, having to teach two classes at once is going to suck a fat cock, and, oh, I'm going to hug from Janae.

01:49:46.140 --> 01:49:47.140
Aw.

01:49:47.140 --> 01:49:50.140
I would hate to do Janae if they're having a vagina, not a penis.

01:50:20.140 --> 01:50:30.140
F.U. goes to loading friends money cause they never pay you back, well ex-friends, never pay you back cause they're bastards.

01:50:30.140 --> 01:50:32.140
Or this person is a bastard.

01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:34.140
And yeah, that's one thing.

01:50:34.140 --> 01:50:39.140
F.U. goes to the search for Miss Applebottom cause it fucking sucks.

01:50:39.140 --> 01:50:43.140
Why the fuck are you going to tell Nelly that you can make your twat clap?

01:50:43.140 --> 01:50:46.140
What kind of thing does it have to do?

01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:51.140
What does it have to do with your butt?

01:50:51.140 --> 01:50:53.140
What does that sound like?

01:50:53.140 --> 01:50:55.140
Let me try, hold on.

01:50:55.140 --> 01:51:00.140
All I gotta say, that'd be cool if I could do it in time with like the Addams Family song.

01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:02.140
No, no, no. Crap, crap.

01:51:02.140 --> 01:51:07.140
Um, hi one more fuck you.

01:51:07.140 --> 01:51:09.140
Fuck you to Loki.

01:51:09.140 --> 01:51:12.140
I'm going to a fucking good Charlotte concert, you bastard.

01:51:12.140 --> 01:51:14.140
And I'm glad about it.

01:51:14.140 --> 01:51:17.140
Yo, hang out with your 107.9 cronies!

01:51:17.140 --> 01:51:20.140
You're gonna be 106.5 cronies, bitch!

01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:23.140
Oh my god! Like, there's a difference.

01:51:23.140 --> 01:51:25.140
There is a difference.

01:51:25.140 --> 01:51:28.140
They don't play Eminem on 107.9.

01:51:28.140 --> 01:51:29.140
Take your hand for it.

01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:31.140
Fucktard!

01:51:32.140 --> 01:51:35.140
I don't know. Angel just said fucktard in my ear.

01:51:35.140 --> 01:51:36.140
Whoa, wait!

01:51:36.140 --> 01:51:37.140
I blame you on it.

01:51:37.140 --> 01:51:41.140
But, I would fuck you, Ghost Nelly, for smacking on my ass.

01:51:41.140 --> 01:51:43.140
And, well, no wait.

01:51:43.140 --> 01:51:54.360
I'm not supposed to but I liked it yeah and yeah fuck having big tits cuz I'm

01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:57.200
actually in studio and I can say that with Loki's face change like shut the

01:51:57.200 --> 01:52:03.120
fuck up fuck having big tits just don't think you're right I'm sorry those aren't

01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:08.280
big tits big tits like double G that's like the stuff that you see on

01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:10.280
Yeah, shut the fuck up.

01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:14.280
They can hold an Xbox between them, shut up.

01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:17.280
Hey, that is so fake.

01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:20.280
An Xbox can hold a small country in it, okay?

01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:25.280
I did not really mean you could put an Xbox on those boobs.

01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:28.280
Controller, maybe. Xbox, no.

01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:32.280
Fuck, did I get you to put an Xbox in my car?

01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:37.280
I'm done.

01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:48.400
I usually have this huge, long F.U. for Sky, but now I don't have an F.U. except for those

01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:51.400
rocks in Sacramento.

01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:53.520
Fuck you, rocks.

01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:54.520
Rock on.

01:52:54.520 --> 01:53:00.320
All right, Angel, your F.U. is for tonight, Angel.

01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:01.800
Stop laughing and rain about something.

01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:05.880
This is not a funny part of the show, you are not allowed to laugh.

01:53:05.880 --> 01:53:06.880
I see.

01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:11.880
Pc Dust is balancing DNL on her boobs, that's why they're stopping right now.

01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:16.880
But can you crush the can?

01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:21.880
Angel.

01:53:21.880 --> 01:53:26.880
Um, thank you to my work for not being able to give us checks on Friday,

01:53:26.880 --> 01:53:31.880
but you know, it's a mail thing so...

01:53:31.880 --> 01:54:00.880
I'm not that angsty this week, surprisingly enough.

01:54:00.880 --> 01:54:07.880
up?

01:54:09.260 --> 01:54:14.200
uh oh, uh oh, here comes lucky again

01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:20.280
fuck you to the stupid god damn commercials on the radio about some truck

01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:24.000
i don't give a fuck if a black hole does not have a hemi

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.300
okay

01:54:26.300 --> 01:54:32.040
I swear to God, if I was that person in this fictitious commercial, I would have gutted

01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:33.840
those two people talking.

01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:35.840
I hated that commercial because it's so fucking annoying.

01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:36.840
Hey, I got a Hemi too!

01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:37.840
Look what I can do!

01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:38.840
How much is that purple tail?

01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:39.840
Does it have a Hemi?

01:54:39.840 --> 01:54:40.840
I'm a redneck!

01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:41.840
Who fucks my own cousin?

01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:42.840
I hate that fucking commercial.

01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:43.840
That's all.

01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:44.840
I'm dead.

01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:45.840
Magus.

01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:50.840
I hate that fucking commercial.

01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:51.840
That's all.

01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:52.840
I'm dead.

01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:53.840
Magus.

01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:59.840
Alright, this is gonna keep me for most of the day.

01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:07.840
F you to the way that the swap room at Rekacon was designed, the way they had the door guards

01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:08.840
and shit.

01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:13.160
There was one way in, one way out.

01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:18.840
could not you know go out for like five seconds and go back in the same door

01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:25.200
and go all the way around the building and go back in it's just a pain in the

01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:33.040
ass and then they had the long lines at the game room then let's see if you do

01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:39.240
traffic good at getting into Pittsburgh for Rekha Khan and F you to fog on the

01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:23.060
All right, sorry. Captain Canada, I'd like to give a nephew to the week. Beer bottle caps

01:56:23.060 --> 01:56:27.360
for being so impossible to open without a bottle opener. And my roommate and myself

01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:32.600
for not having bottle opener in our dorm. It took me like 10 minutes and a cut hand

01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:35.640
before I finally ripped the cap off with a pair of scissors. It was like sitting on the

01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:39.840
pot and then realizing there's no toilet paper.

01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:46.800
Wipe your ass with a shower curtain.

01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:55.320
Zodiac Knight would like to send a big F.U. to his school, the Illinois Institute of Technology

01:56:55.320 --> 01:56:59.640
for being such money-grubbing whores who continue to not provide for their students.

01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:02.640
And if you can't say the school's name on the air, I'll understand.

01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:04.640
Oops.

01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:07.640
Hi, ZodiacNet, by the way.

01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:10.640
Um, let's see.

01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:16.640
Evil Naoki 2DX would like to say, fuck Seton Medical Center for not telling us that my grandmother suffers from anemia.

01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:22.640
Thanks to those asshats, my grandmother is on life support and I have no fucking idea if she's going to live to see tomorrow.

01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:56.280
Piper Girl would like to say, F you to programming, the C language, pointers and arrays.

01:57:56.280 --> 01:57:59.920
Fuck you to my fan club, who seem to show up at the arcade every time I show up and

01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:02.000
look like they're watching more than just me playing Initial D.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:03.560
They're watching your press, of course.

01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:10.240
F you to stalkers in general, because they're giving ex-C9, C9, M me creepy looks in terms

01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:12.560
of smiling and trying to be friendly when it's creepy as fuck.

01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:18.080
And F you to midterms, because of those I haven't been able to go to Orange Lawn's radio.

01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:20.900
And I miss the Orange Lawn's radio crew, so yeah.

01:58:20.900 --> 01:58:26.560
SVI is tuning in from Las Vegas tonight and would like to give an F-You of the week to

01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:29.840
the manager of the virtual reality zone of the Adventure Dome at Circus Circus in Las

01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:30.840
Vegas.

01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:33.800
That was one of the first places I ever played VR.

01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:37.840
They don't fix their bimani machines so many locals accuse the workers of being lazy ass

01:58:37.840 --> 01:58:40.440
bastards when it's actually the manager who is to be blamed for it.

01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:42.880
F-You to myself for being left out of too much.

01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:46.940
I want to get out of Las Vegas so I can be back with my friends back at the RTA crew.

01:59:16.940 --> 01:59:27.940
Fred Phelps, I think, and he's a total ass-hat who's just an attention-horn, that's how he does it by fag-bashing, so that's why we don't like to acknowledge that he exists, because sick people like that don't exist in my world.

01:59:27.940 --> 01:59:34.940
Be sure to tune in to his show, The 700 Club, on the Family Channel.

01:59:34.940 --> 01:59:36.940
Yeah, weekdays at 11.

01:59:36.940 --> 01:59:43.940
700 Club, great material for having friends over and wanting to talk about something.

02:00:13.940 --> 02:00:20.940
If you like this video, please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel.

Yeah, I'd like to give a shout out to all my homies in CB4, yeah, peace out man!

02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:26.080
And I gotta give a shout out to Carson Daly because he's so fine! Oh my god! Oh my god, he always is so fine!

02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:33.080
It wasn't Carson Daly, it was Justin Timberlake, now get it right, bitch!

02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:36.080
That was me!

02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:38.080
Everybody knows that Lance is the hottest.

02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:40.080
Oh my god! No, I'm good!

02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:43.080
No, Justin is the hottest because he has solo crew now and he's like so hot!

02:03:43.080 --> 02:03:45.080
Oh my god!

02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:47.080
Oh, my whole cheerleading team thinks that.

02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:49.080
Yeah!

02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:51.080
Okay.

02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:54.080
Now that we've thoroughly scared our listeners.

02:03:54.080 --> 02:03:56.080
Like, oh my god!

02:03:56.080 --> 02:03:59.080
I think what we'll do

02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:01.080
is kill ourselves. No.

02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:02.080
Uh, what we're gonna do...

02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:04.080
Oh, awesome!

02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:05.080
Can I join?

02:04:05.080 --> 02:04:08.080
It's like Suicide Club all over again.

02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:09.080
Yes.

02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:12.080
I'm doing that voice the whole night now.

02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:13.080
Yeah.

02:04:13.080 --> 02:04:19.080
Like, I'm going to do this voice the whole night long, because, you know, like, it annoys

02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:20.080
people.

02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:22.080
Yeah, this is a ladies' man.

02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:26.080
I hope you get your wang hugified.

02:04:26.080 --> 02:04:27.080
The wang?

02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:30.080

02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:31.080

02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:42.600
ten inches.

02:04:42.600 --> 02:04:52.020
Yeah, that's pretty small.

02:04:52.020 --> 02:04:53.020
Like totally.

02:04:53.020 --> 02:04:57.620
I think we'll try to save this show by taking a quick break.

02:04:57.620 --> 02:05:01.860
And when we come back from the break, some of us are going to show off our shit in Karaoke

02:05:01.860 --> 02:05:02.860
Revolution.

02:05:02.860 --> 02:05:10.620
All right, so we're going to be singing some karaoke revolution and also we're going to

02:05:10.620 --> 02:05:16.320
be doing some Ask Orange Lounge. So send in those questions over private message for Ask

02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:19.940
Orange Lounge when we come back. It's going to be a little bit of an extended break because

02:05:19.940 --> 02:05:25.380
we're going to set up some things for karaoke revolution. So we're going to play some songs

02:05:25.380 --> 02:05:29.020

02:05:29.020 --> 02:05:40.580
Maniacs, including Johnny Johnna, Happy Hopper, Twinbee, Quickening, and we'll do In My Dreams,

02:05:40.580 --> 02:05:47.580
because that's one of my favorite Bomani songs ever.

02:07:10.580 --> 02:07:12.580
Now you have to quit the drill

02:07:12.580 --> 02:07:14.580
I don't wanna do it

02:08:12.580 --> 02:08:31.580

1, 2, 3, 4!

02:09:11.580 --> 02:09:13.580
You don't know

They want to be the one that they're used to, won't you sing?

02:09:28.580 --> 02:09:30.580
You don't know

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

02:11:24.580 --> 02:11:40.580
Oh yeah, yeah

02:11:40.580 --> 02:11:43.580
How can I know what you're thinking?

02:11:43.580 --> 02:11:47.580
How do I know what's going on?

02:11:47.580 --> 02:11:50.580
Don't make it hard to believe in

02:11:50.580 --> 02:11:54.580
Don't make it hard to go on

02:11:54.580 --> 02:11:57.580
Put a little faith in me now

02:11:57.580 --> 02:12:01.580
Put a little trust in me somehow

02:12:01.580 --> 02:12:05.580
Cause when I hold you I'm never bound

02:12:05.580 --> 02:12:08.580
Cause it's all that I feel

02:12:08.580 --> 02:12:11.580
In my dream, but in my dreams

02:12:11.580 --> 02:12:14.580
You and I can do it so great

02:12:14.580 --> 02:12:18.580
But in my heart I can feel

02:12:18.580 --> 02:12:27.580
I wanna make you feel free, I wanna make you feel forever

02:12:27.580 --> 02:12:35.580

02:19:53.380 --> 02:19:57.380

Change your heart to a little white stuff

Born and beaten, that's the power of love

02:23:09.020 --> 02:23:13.020
Tough and balanced, rich like cream

02:23:13.020 --> 02:23:17.020
Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream

02:23:17.020 --> 02:23:21.020
Maybe I wouldn't do it and make her own right

02:23:21.020 --> 02:23:25.020
Power of love will keep you home at night

02:23:25.020 --> 02:23:29.020

It's strong, it's sudden, it's cruel sometimes

02:23:37.020 --> 02:23:41.020
But it might just save your life

02:23:41.020 --> 02:23:45.020

It's the power of love

02:23:49.020 --> 02:23:51.020
Uh, Maggots, I think you need to sing a little louder.

02:23:51.020 --> 02:23:59.020
First time feeling it might make you sad Next time you feel it might make you mad

02:23:59.020 --> 02:24:07.020
Will you be glad, baby, when you're found It's the power to make love around

02:24:07.020 --> 02:24:15.020
Don't take money, don't take fame Don't need no credit card to ride this train

02:24:15.020 --> 02:24:19.020
As strong and as sudden and cruel sometimes

02:24:19.020 --> 02:24:24.020
It might just save your life

02:24:24.020 --> 02:24:29.020
And saving all your love is fair

02:24:29.020 --> 02:24:32.020
Yeah, but you don't care

02:24:32.020 --> 02:24:36.020
You know what to do

02:24:36.020 --> 02:24:40.020
When it gets all of you

02:24:40.020 --> 02:24:48.020

02:24:48.020 --> 02:24:52.020
You feel the power of love

02:24:52.020 --> 02:24:55.020
Do you feel it?

02:25:00.020 --> 02:25:02.020
I'm really suckin' on this

02:25:04.020 --> 02:25:07.020
It's okay, Magus, you suck all the time

02:25:07.020 --> 02:25:09.020
Shut up! Shut up, Robin!

02:25:09.020 --> 02:25:11.020
Shut up, Robin. I don't suck. You suck.

02:25:11.020 --> 02:25:13.020

02:25:13.020 --> 02:25:15.020
Stolen.

02:25:15.020 --> 02:25:17.020
Don't take money

02:25:17.020 --> 02:25:19.020
Don't take fame

02:25:19.020 --> 02:25:21.020
Don't need no credit card

02:25:21.020 --> 02:25:23.020
To ride this train

02:25:23.020 --> 02:25:25.020
Coven diamonds

02:25:25.020 --> 02:25:27.020
And from it's steed

02:25:27.020 --> 02:25:29.020
You won't feel nothing

02:25:29.020 --> 02:25:31.020
To feel

02:25:31.020 --> 02:25:33.020
You feel the power

02:25:33.020 --> 02:25:35.020
You feel the power of love

02:25:35.020 --> 02:25:37.020

You feel the power of love

02:25:49.020 --> 02:25:55.020
You feel the power of love

02:25:55.020 --> 02:25:57.020
Alright

02:25:57.020 --> 02:26:01.020
Magus got a score of 8,936

02:26:01.020 --> 02:26:03.020
We've been officially saved

02:26:03.020 --> 02:26:04.020
Why?

02:26:04.020 --> 02:26:05.020
Because he's done.

02:26:05.020 --> 02:26:06.020
He's done?

02:26:06.020 --> 02:26:07.020
Oh, okay.

02:26:07.020 --> 02:26:09.020
Not even a gold record.

02:26:09.020 --> 02:26:12.020
I've got a place, so I have a reason.

02:26:12.020 --> 02:26:14.020
Basically, since we're kind of...

02:26:14.020 --> 02:26:16.020
This isn't a popular segment with our chat room.

02:26:16.020 --> 02:26:18.020
I think I got the equivalent of a C.

02:26:18.020 --> 02:26:19.020
I don't know.

02:26:19.020 --> 02:26:20.020
My voice isn't too good today, so...

02:26:20.020 --> 02:26:24.020
We'll let one more person go, and then we'll judge where we're at.

02:26:24.020 --> 02:26:27.020
So, Janae, why don't you pixie dust, why don't you take over.

02:26:27.020 --> 02:26:32.020
And if the chat room says, please Lord, pull the plug, after Janae, we'll stop this segment.

02:26:32.020 --> 02:26:34.020
Otherwise, we're putting Loki on stage.

02:27:02.020 --> 02:27:07.020
She's going to do a little bit of sexy piano loving here from a Pixie Dust.

02:27:07.020 --> 02:27:14.020
Alright, ready? Here she goes. Remember you want to kind of keep the green arrow on the blue bar.

02:27:14.020 --> 02:27:20.020
That's right. You're going to be singing at Central Station.

02:27:20.020 --> 02:27:23.020
Alright, here we go. Loading. This is Pixie Dust with Don't Know Why.

02:27:23.020 --> 02:27:26.180
and chat room you can vote if you want this segment to keep going with Loki singing a

02:27:26.180 --> 02:27:31.180
song or if you want us to end it.

02:27:31.180 --> 02:27:58.180
I'll wait till I've saw the sun I don't know why I love you by the house of

02:27:58.180 --> 02:28:10.180
I don't know why I didn't come I don't know why I didn't come

02:28:10.180 --> 02:28:22.180
When I saw the break of day I wish that I would fly away

02:28:22.180 --> 02:28:36.180
Can't change till you've got me in my hands My heart is dreshed in your eyes

02:28:36.180 --> 02:28:46.180
And you'll be on my mind For all I know

02:28:46.180 --> 02:28:56.180
I'll be on my mind for a little while

02:28:56.180 --> 02:29:01.180
I'll cross the endless sea

02:29:01.180 --> 02:29:06.180
I will die in that sea

02:29:06.180 --> 02:29:11.180
But I'll be right here

02:29:11.180 --> 02:29:16.180
I'm running down the road

02:29:17.180 --> 02:29:22.180
My heart is drenching

02:29:22.180 --> 02:29:26.180
Can I get that one?

02:29:27.180 --> 02:29:38.180
You'll be on my mind forever

02:29:38.180 --> 02:29:45.180
I don't know why I don't know why I don't know why

02:30:08.180 --> 02:30:10.180
I didn't come

02:30:11.180 --> 02:30:15.180
Feeling empty as a drum

02:30:16.180 --> 02:30:20.180
I don't know why I didn't come

02:30:21.180 --> 02:30:25.180
I don't know why I didn't come

02:30:26.180 --> 02:30:32.180
I don't know why I didn't come

02:30:32.180 --> 02:30:47.780
All right, a score of 31,043 points for Pixie Dust. Nice job. And also a platinum. She is

02:30:47.780 --> 02:30:53.620
a superstar. I let you guys vote in the chat room if you wanted to keep this statement

02:30:53.620 --> 02:30:59.300
going because some of you guys were complaining about it. And you voted, Loki has to sing.

02:30:59.300 --> 02:31:11.100
You guys wanted to hear it, so Loki will be singing complicated.

02:31:11.100 --> 02:31:12.740
In the meantime, vote in the chat room.

02:31:12.740 --> 02:31:14.700
Do you want no stylin' to sing?

02:31:14.700 --> 02:31:15.700
No stylin' me?

02:31:15.700 --> 02:31:16.700
Loki, sing the parody.

02:31:16.700 --> 02:31:17.700
Sing the word out.

02:31:17.700 --> 02:31:18.700
No stylin' will be up after Loki.

02:31:18.700 --> 02:31:19.700
I don't want to sing.

02:31:19.700 --> 02:31:20.700
I suck.

02:31:20.700 --> 02:31:21.700
You'll see why.

02:31:21.700 --> 02:31:28.700
I should have just done my live performance as the song that we should have voted off.

02:31:28.700 --> 02:31:30.700
What the hell is happening to this microphone, too?

02:31:30.700 --> 02:31:32.700
It's like all fucked up.

02:31:32.700 --> 02:31:35.700
God damn it, I don't wanna play a song!

02:31:35.700 --> 02:31:38.700
Hey, who told the chat room to vote?

02:31:38.700 --> 02:31:40.700
Oh, we just cycled out of a game.

02:31:40.700 --> 02:31:42.700
Teninga is the winner.

02:31:42.700 --> 02:31:44.700
Teninga is the winner!

02:31:45.700 --> 02:31:47.700
Alright, here we go.

02:31:47.700 --> 02:31:49.700
Going back into a new game.

02:31:49.700 --> 02:31:51.700
And we're gonna play Teninga again.

02:31:51.700 --> 02:31:53.700
Alright, here we go.

02:31:53.700 --> 02:31:55.700
Loki will be singing Complicated.

02:31:55.700 --> 02:32:21.900
And, Loki will be singing at the pit stop, as will the song sound like a pit stop.

02:32:21.900 --> 02:32:23.900
I don't want to do this!

02:32:25.900 --> 02:32:29.900
Dude, I am like a chick on this stage. She is so lame.

02:32:32.900 --> 02:32:40.900
Okay, just so you know chat room, I can't sing. And they're doing this because they hate you. They don't like you.

02:32:40.900 --> 02:32:45.900
I'm feeling sweet

02:32:45.900 --> 02:32:48.900
Chill out, which is all I'm looking for

02:32:48.900 --> 02:32:51.900
Lay back, it's all been done before

02:32:51.900 --> 02:32:55.900
And if you could go on leave, let it be

02:32:55.900 --> 02:32:57.900
You will see

02:32:57.900 --> 02:33:00.900
I like you, you are

02:33:00.900 --> 02:33:03.900
When we're driving in your car

02:33:03.900 --> 02:33:04.900
When we're driving in your car

02:33:04.900 --> 02:33:06.900
When we're driving in your car

02:33:06.900 --> 02:33:17.020

I can't hit the pitch cuz I can't sing where's the crap you're making me do this

02:34:02.540 --> 02:34:10.600
Laugh out when you strike your pose take off all your preppy clothes get naked on the floor

I

02:34:13.840 --> 02:34:15.900
Hate this somebody else

02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:24.260
Watching your back just can't relax. You're trying to be cool. You're looking like a fool to me

02:34:24.260 --> 02:34:30.260
Tell me, why'd you have to make me go and play this fucking game?

02:34:30.260 --> 02:34:34.260
I fucking hate, I see why you're acting like somebody else

02:34:34.260 --> 02:34:37.260
But I can't keep up the words

02:34:37.260 --> 02:34:39.260
Lies like this

02:34:39.260 --> 02:34:42.260
You fall and you crawl and you've been taken

02:34:42.260 --> 02:34:44.260
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

02:34:44.260 --> 02:34:45.260
And there's tough words

02:34:45.260 --> 02:34:47.260
And what's even the stupid thing?

02:34:47.260 --> 02:34:49.260
Hey, why are you walking away?

02:34:49.260 --> 02:34:52.260
Fuck you, get your ass back in this fucking concert!

02:34:54.260 --> 02:34:56.260
No, no, no.

You suck.

02:35:00.260 --> 02:35:02.260
Bite my ass.

Lay back, it's all been done before.

Eat my ass, you could only let it be.

02:35:14.260 --> 02:35:16.260
You'll see.

02:35:16.260 --> 02:35:22.100
I think this segment is really dead. You should stop torturing the chat room now

02:35:22.220 --> 02:35:26.940
You're really trying to be cool looking like a fool to me. I could have told you that

02:35:27.460 --> 02:35:29.460
Tell me

I hate it. I want her to break down cry again

02:35:40.660 --> 02:35:47.660
You'll fail, and you'll crawl, and you'll break, and you'll take, and you'll get, and you'll turn it, blah blah blah blah

02:35:47.660 --> 02:35:51.660
Crowd boost, so fucking take that up your ass

02:35:51.660 --> 02:35:57.660
No, no, why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?

02:35:57.660 --> 02:36:03.660
I see the way you're looking and acting like somebody else gets me frustrated

02:36:03.660 --> 02:36:09.660
Life's like this and that's it, she's failing, she's failing

02:36:09.660 --> 02:36:11.660
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do

02:36:11.660 --> 02:36:13.660
I want to sing to promise me

02:36:13.660 --> 02:36:15.660
I'll never forget

02:36:15.660 --> 02:36:17.660
You

02:36:17.660 --> 02:36:18.660
Fucking

02:36:18.660 --> 02:36:20.660
Suck

02:36:20.660 --> 02:36:22.660
Oooh

02:36:22.660 --> 02:36:24.660
Alright

02:36:24.660 --> 02:36:26.660
A score of

02:36:26.660 --> 02:36:28.660
5824 points

02:36:28.660 --> 02:36:29.660
For Loki

02:36:29.660 --> 02:36:31.660
Believe it or not, not even a gold record

02:36:31.660 --> 02:36:33.660
Alright

02:36:33.660 --> 02:36:35.660
You guys voted

02:36:35.660 --> 02:36:37.660
If no stylin' should sing or not

02:36:37.660 --> 02:36:41.660
You voted that yes, No Styling needs to get up there to sing.

02:36:41.660 --> 02:36:45.660
So, No Styling, what song are you going to do?

02:36:51.660 --> 02:36:55.660
We don't know what he's going to sing because he hasn't chosen and he doesn't know these songs.

02:36:55.660 --> 02:36:57.660
So yeah.

02:36:57.660 --> 02:36:59.660
What are you going to pick for him?

02:36:59.660 --> 02:37:13.180
You'll laugh, you'll cry. It's a feel good song of the year. I'm coming out. Hit me with

02:37:13.180 --> 02:37:15.180
Give me with your best shot.

02:37:15.180 --> 02:37:17.180
Yes, yes.

02:37:17.180 --> 02:37:20.180
Give me with your best shot.

02:37:20.180 --> 02:37:22.180
Give me with your best shot.

02:37:22.180 --> 02:37:24.180
No, that's killer.

02:37:24.180 --> 02:37:26.180
That's all one go.

02:37:29.180 --> 02:37:33.180
Did you ever know what you were meant to be?

02:37:33.180 --> 02:37:37.180
No, Stalin will be singing Wind Beneath My Wings.

02:37:38.180 --> 02:37:40.180
Everything I wish I could.

02:37:40.180 --> 02:37:43.180
Yeah, the mic's got to be really close to your mouth, okay?

02:37:43.180 --> 02:37:44.180
Alright, here we go.

02:37:44.180 --> 02:37:50.180
No Stylin's version of Wind Beneath My Wings, and No Stylin will be singing at the party.

02:37:50.180 --> 02:37:51.180
Alright, here we go.

02:37:51.180 --> 02:37:52.180
Oh, yeah, okay.

02:37:52.180 --> 02:37:53.180
No Stylin on Superstar TV.

02:37:53.180 --> 02:37:54.180
Here we go.

02:37:54.180 --> 02:37:58.180
No Stylin on Superstar TV with Wind Beneath My Wings.

02:37:58.180 --> 02:37:59.180
Enjoy.

02:37:59.180 --> 02:38:06.180
It must be happening cold, there it is, there it is, there it is.

02:38:29.180 --> 02:38:36.180
in myself. Never have the light on your face. Your work content to let me shine. You always

02:38:36.180 --> 02:38:54.220
your work content to let me shine you always walk the step of the night

02:38:54.220 --> 02:39:22.220
So I was the one with all the strength, A beautiful face without a name, for so long.

02:39:22.220 --> 02:39:24.220
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

02:39:24.220 --> 02:39:27.220
Thank you.

02:39:27.220 --> 02:39:29.220
Boys.

02:39:29.220 --> 02:39:37.220
Do you ever, ever let me know my hero?

02:39:37.220 --> 02:39:45.220
Everything I would like to be.

02:39:45.220 --> 02:39:50.220
I am an animal

02:39:51.220 --> 02:39:56.220
For you are the one beneath my wings

02:39:57.220 --> 02:40:00.220
I am an animal

02:40:01.220 --> 02:40:03.220
I am a pig

02:40:04.220 --> 02:40:06.220
I have a freak

02:40:07.220 --> 02:40:09.220
I will eat all of this

02:40:10.220 --> 02:40:13.220
But I've got it all here

02:40:13.220 --> 02:40:18.220
You're in my heart

02:40:19.220 --> 02:40:23.220
I want you to know I know the truth

02:40:24.220 --> 02:40:31.220
I will be nothing without you

02:40:34.220 --> 02:40:41.220
If you ever know that you're my hero

02:40:41.220 --> 02:40:47.220
Oh, everything I would ever be.

02:40:50.220 --> 02:40:53.220
I'm in my home.

02:40:53.220 --> 02:40:57.220
I am a champion.

02:40:57.220 --> 02:41:02.220
You are the wind beneath my wings.

02:41:02.220 --> 02:41:11.220
Did I ever tell you my hero?

02:41:11.220 --> 02:41:18.220
For everything I wish I could be

02:41:18.220 --> 02:41:27.220
Oh and I, I could fly higher

02:41:27.220 --> 02:41:43.220
For you are the wind beneath my wings, because you are the wind beneath my wings.

02:41:43.220 --> 02:41:56.220
Oh, you are the wind beneath my wings.

02:41:56.220 --> 02:42:04.180
Fly, fly, fly.

02:42:04.180 --> 02:42:08.220
Fly, fly away.

02:42:08.220 --> 02:42:10.060
Fly, fly, fly away.

02:42:10.060 --> 02:42:11.120
Fly, fly, fly away.

02:42:11.120 --> 02:42:12.020
Fly, fly, fly away.

02:42:12.020 --> 02:42:13.020
Wow!

02:42:13.020 --> 02:42:17.000
No Stylin has failed his song with 2,146 points.

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:24.420
No Stylin failed Wind Beneath My Wings and Tenenga has broken down on stage and cried.

02:42:24.420 --> 02:42:28.980
Alright, here you go you guys, this is how it's going to work, you guys are going to

02:42:28.980 --> 02:42:29.980
vote for a winner.

02:42:29.980 --> 02:42:35.140
The winner will come back and sing an encore song which will be selected at random by the

02:42:35.140 --> 02:42:39.860
game unless, unless it's a song that we've already done, then we'll back out and pick

02:42:39.860 --> 02:42:41.020
a different one, okay?

02:42:41.020 --> 02:42:46.020
So here we go, just put it in the chat room, all in caps, who you want the winner to be.

02:42:46.020 --> 02:42:53.820
You can vote for me, I sang Like A Virgin, you can vote for Magus who sang Power Of Love,

02:42:53.820 --> 02:42:59.100
You can vote for a pixie dust who sang, what the hell did you sing, I forgot already.

02:42:59.100 --> 02:43:01.380
You sang Don't Know Why, you sang the Noah Jones one.

02:43:01.380 --> 02:43:06.540
And you can vote for Loki who sang Complicated at your request, or you can vote for No Stylin

02:43:06.540 --> 02:43:08.740
who sang Wind Beneath My Wings.

02:43:08.740 --> 02:43:16.380
So put all in caps right now who you want to sing again and who will play a random song.

02:43:16.380 --> 02:43:20.620
We see some Rob, some No Stylin, we'll see.

02:43:20.620 --> 02:43:24.620
There's going to be a tie between Loki and no stylin.

02:43:24.620 --> 02:43:26.620
This is what it's going to be.

02:43:26.620 --> 02:43:27.620
I predict it.

02:43:27.620 --> 02:43:28.620
Minus Cleoparison.

02:43:28.620 --> 02:43:31.620
Alright, you guys have a minute to flood our screen with your votes.

02:43:31.620 --> 02:43:32.620
I won't fix you.

02:43:32.620 --> 02:43:33.620
Sorry about that.

02:43:33.620 --> 02:43:38.820
I guess people who don't like flooding, but my inbox is already full of your Ask Orange

02:43:38.820 --> 02:43:40.620
Lounge questions, which we probably won't get to now.

02:43:40.620 --> 02:43:43.620
I love Angel, she voted for me.

02:43:43.620 --> 02:43:44.620
Okay, we see some Janaes.

02:43:44.620 --> 02:43:46.620
Oh, I'm starting to see some Lokis.

02:43:46.620 --> 02:43:58.980
Oh no, there's four lines for Loki. Victor, no styling. Um, let's see. Loki wins. Loki,

02:43:58.980 --> 02:44:05.940
um, I don't know. It's kind of close. You guys, it's between me, Loki and no styling.

02:44:05.940 --> 02:44:11.940
What do you think? What do you guys think? You guys didn't vote for me. You kind of thinking

02:44:11.940 --> 02:44:13.940
I'm thinking, you did get a vote Janae, I did get one too.

02:44:13.940 --> 02:44:15.940
I did, me.

02:44:15.940 --> 02:44:17.940
You know what?

02:44:17.940 --> 02:44:19.940
I'm thinking Loki is the winner.

02:44:19.940 --> 02:44:23.940
Loki is going to do an encore presentation right now.

02:44:23.940 --> 02:44:25.940
Loki is the winner.

02:44:25.940 --> 02:44:27.940
Red wine.

02:44:27.940 --> 02:44:29.940
No, I know.

02:44:29.940 --> 02:44:31.940
Yes, yes!

02:44:31.940 --> 02:44:33.940
No, no.

02:44:33.940 --> 02:44:37.940
It's going to be randomly selected by the computer.

02:44:37.940 --> 02:44:43.940
randomly selected by the computer. If it's a song we've already heard, we're going to cancel it out and do a different one because we want to hear something new.

02:44:43.940 --> 02:44:45.940
Alright, ready Loki?

02:44:45.940 --> 02:44:50.940
Alright.

02:44:50.940 --> 02:44:55.940
This is no scoring mode, it's just playing karaoke fun. Actually, no wait, no, I'm sorry.

02:44:55.940 --> 02:44:58.940
No wait, I don't remember how to get it to select random now.

02:44:58.940 --> 02:45:04.940
Okay, you ready Loki? We're going to pick one completely at random. Here is the song Loki will be singing as his encore.

02:45:04.940 --> 02:45:11.940
for. The wheel is spinning and it's landing on. It's the end of the world as we know it.

02:45:11.940 --> 02:45:17.940
Alright, here we go. Loki singing is the end of the world as we know it at the county fair.

02:45:17.940 --> 02:45:18.940
Enjoy.

02:45:18.940 --> 02:45:29.940
Let's sing along. Yeah, group sing along.

02:45:29.940 --> 02:45:34.940
I am so not singing this song, I'm just gonna...

02:45:34.940 --> 02:45:39.940
That starts with an earthquake, birds and snakes and airplanes.

02:45:39.940 --> 02:45:42.940
Lady Bruce is not afraid.

02:45:42.940 --> 02:45:48.940
I am not afraid of words.

02:45:48.940 --> 02:45:51.940
I don't like this song. I can't work with this.

02:45:51.940 --> 02:45:54.940
Uh...uh...

02:45:54.940 --> 02:45:58.940
I can't hit the pitch.

02:45:58.940 --> 02:46:02.940
World has deck.

02:46:02.940 --> 02:46:06.940
Dude, they're too fast. Give me a different song. Come on, seriously.

02:46:06.940 --> 02:46:10.940
This is ridiculous. I can't remember this.

02:46:10.940 --> 02:46:14.940
That means we are going to pick the song for him.

02:46:14.940 --> 02:46:18.940
Right?

02:46:18.940 --> 02:46:22.940
I can't work this. This is too fast.

02:46:22.940 --> 02:46:39.780
What do you guys say, believe, like a girl, just want to have a, alright, I'm coming out,

The time has come for me

02:48:03.540 --> 02:48:05.540
Breakin' out of the shell

02:48:05.540 --> 02:48:07.540

02:49:03.460 --> 02:49:10.460
I'm actually passing this song. That's pretty amazing, I think, since I can't sing worth a shit.

02:49:14.460 --> 02:49:17.460
Oh yeah, play the instrumental solo. Oh yeah, oh yeah.

02:49:22.460 --> 02:49:24.460

And it just keeps on going on.

02:50:21.900 --> 02:50:27.900
I'm going to kill anyone in the chat room that has a recording of this. You're going to so die. I know where you live.

02:50:27.900 --> 02:50:31.900
As a reminder, the show will be broadcast this week on Thursday.

02:50:33.900 --> 02:50:41.900
A score of 6,964 points for Loki. Not even a gold record. There is no justice in this world. Okay.

02:50:42.900 --> 02:50:46.940
Alright, we're gonna shut the game off now. Oh my god. I have not laughed that hard

02:50:48.020 --> 02:50:54.420
My head I laugh so hard. I peed okay. I put a little I peed a little bit I

02:50:55.020 --> 02:50:57.820
Can't lose my job anymore, so no sex tonight, huh?

02:50:57.820 --> 02:51:14.300
out. Oh, that hurt so bad. Oh my God. I can't believe you. Okay. I should have been like,

02:51:14.300 --> 02:51:21.260
I'm sliding in. You know, that would have been even better. But, alright. Whew, alright.

02:51:21.260 --> 02:51:25.340
Luckily, the one person that Loki forgets has a recording is me.

02:51:25.340 --> 02:51:26.340
Woo!

02:51:26.340 --> 02:51:27.340
Alright.

02:51:27.340 --> 02:51:31.300
My head hurts so bad.

02:51:31.300 --> 02:51:34.660
Since we probably, we might run a little bit over tonight, but I don't think anybody cares

02:51:34.660 --> 02:51:35.660
after that.

02:51:35.660 --> 02:51:38.060
And to think, you guys wanted to end the segment before Loki sang.

02:51:38.060 --> 02:51:39.460
I don't want to sing anymore.

02:51:39.460 --> 02:51:41.460
I think we should make him sing again.

02:51:41.460 --> 02:51:44.220
Oh, come on.

02:51:44.220 --> 02:51:45.220
We have to...

02:51:45.220 --> 02:51:46.220
It should be...

02:51:46.220 --> 02:51:47.220
Okay, I got it.

02:51:47.220 --> 02:51:48.220
It's going to have to be a bit.

02:51:48.220 --> 02:51:49.220
It's the only reason people are going to tune into our show now.

02:51:49.220 --> 02:51:53.220
It should be a duo between Victor and Loki.

02:51:53.220 --> 02:51:57.220
You know what? When the Karaoke Revolution expansion pack comes out, Loki will sing again.

02:51:57.220 --> 02:52:01.220
So, you're my fucking monkey, Loki will sing when I tell you to.

02:52:01.220 --> 02:52:05.220
Dance, monkey dance.

02:52:05.220 --> 02:52:09.220
What we're going to do when the expansion pack comes out, we'll do this again.

02:52:09.220 --> 02:52:13.220
This is more incentive for Konami to get those expansion packs out.

02:52:13.220 --> 02:52:17.220
As promised...

02:52:17.220 --> 02:52:22.220
Oh my God, let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

02:52:23.720 --> 02:52:25.960
I have no idea how we're gonna follow that segment,

02:52:25.960 --> 02:52:27.440
but we'll sure try.

02:52:27.440 --> 02:52:29.400
Will Pixie Dust take her top off?

02:52:29.400 --> 02:52:31.280
Will Magus take his pants off?

02:52:31.280 --> 02:52:34.640
I hope not, that would be a sign that make me blind.

02:52:37.160 --> 02:52:40.000
Here we go, first question tonight, and ask Orange Lounge.

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:41.840
No!

02:52:43.840 --> 02:52:45.080
What happened?

02:52:45.080 --> 02:52:55.080
Oh my God, I guess I missed it. Here we go. First question. First question from... I can't

02:52:55.080 --> 02:52:59.320
find... Okay, here we go. Leadfoot would like to know, how did MobaMoga get into Extreme

02:52:59.320 --> 02:53:07.640
and which one of you made it? Good, thank God. MobaMoga's by The Orange Lounge and it

02:53:07.640 --> 02:53:11.560
got into Extreme because Konami got cheap and stopped licensing things. One more time,

02:53:11.560 --> 02:53:16.560
says, Whew! I saw her do this! All right, Ledford would also like to know, what happened

02:53:16.560 --> 02:53:20.780
to Orange Crush? That was kind of a regular segment we had on the show. Well, that's Rice

02:53:20.780 --> 02:53:25.460
Princess's thing, and since she's not really on the show much anymore, because she spends

02:53:25.460 --> 02:53:29.380
a lot of time coming over for Vanilla Sky. But of course, Rice Princess always welcome

02:53:29.380 --> 02:53:33.620
at the show, and if she comes back, I'm hoping she'll bring some Orange Crush with her. A

02:53:33.620 --> 02:53:38.420
good substitute would always be Vanilla Sky video game trivia, which you can hear on Vanilla

02:53:38.420 --> 02:53:47.340
Sky, which is the bad music and video game trivia. Alright, so let's see. XBI would like

02:53:47.340 --> 02:53:51.580
to know, what songs do you guys look forward to playing on Guitar Freak 10th or Drummania

02:53:51.580 --> 02:53:57.620
9th Mix? None of them. None of them. It's the same fucking game over and over. Maybe

02:53:57.620 --> 02:54:01.620
the Weezer song, One Time, for shits and giggles. I think that would be about it. I think they

02:54:01.620 --> 02:54:07.820
play Mad Blast, but that wasn't on this one. No, I don't think it was. Alright. John Fields

02:54:07.820 --> 02:54:12.300
would like to know, Loki, which Beatmania SIM do you prefer, and why do you prefer it

02:54:12.300 --> 02:54:17.940
over the other, BM98 or Beatmania DX? I don't play Beatmania SIMs, but I play the emulators,

02:54:17.940 --> 02:54:25.500
so that was kind of cool. But I was using a, what was it, Beatmania DX, whatever it

02:54:25.500 --> 02:54:29.500
is. There's actually another one, too, that not many people know of. I can't remember

02:54:29.500 --> 02:54:33.660
what exactly the name of it was, because I had the link on my old computer. But there's

02:54:33.660 --> 02:54:40.840
There's another sim out there that's comparable to B-Mania DX.

02:54:40.840 --> 02:54:46.120
Question from Jay Kinetic, Astro Glide or KY?

02:54:46.120 --> 02:54:49.120
Pixie Dust says Astro Glide.

02:54:49.120 --> 02:54:51.560
Nelly says KY.

02:54:51.560 --> 02:54:53.000
Warming liquid says Nelly.

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:59.000
I say choice number three, ID, which most of you have probably never heard of.

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:01.440
Janae knows of it.

02:55:01.440 --> 02:55:04.040
Anybody else care to answer this question?

02:55:04.040 --> 02:55:07.160
No, all right then, moving on.

02:55:07.160 --> 02:55:11.440
Darktits, oh, now's the vote for Loki's song.

02:55:11.440 --> 02:55:13.940
SGhost would like to know, what package are you guys using

02:55:13.940 --> 02:55:15.320
for Live 365?

02:55:15.320 --> 02:55:16.760
I'm trying to start up a station,

02:55:16.760 --> 02:55:18.100
and you seem to have a good thing going.

02:55:18.100 --> 02:55:21.200
PS, I won't be playing anything on Sunday night, so you know.

02:55:21.200 --> 02:55:22.940
Without getting into too many specifics,

02:55:22.940 --> 02:55:24.780
I can talk about this more with you offline,

02:55:24.780 --> 02:55:27.160
but we have the personal broadcaster package.

02:55:27.160 --> 02:55:28.820
We don't run as a commercial station,

02:55:28.820 --> 02:55:30.400
because we don't run our own in-house ads

02:55:30.400 --> 02:55:31.320
or anything like that.

02:55:31.320 --> 02:55:32.940
And we don't really have that many people

02:55:32.940 --> 02:55:35.740
that listen that necessitate us needing hundreds

02:55:35.740 --> 02:55:37.940
of simultaneous listeners.

02:55:37.940 --> 02:55:39.540
So we have one of the personal packages.

02:55:39.540 --> 02:55:42.380
I can give you the specifics offline.

02:55:42.380 --> 02:55:45.980
He says he wants to do his own station.

02:55:45.980 --> 02:55:47.380
Hey, sure, why not?

02:55:47.380 --> 02:55:48.460
The more the merrier.

02:55:48.460 --> 02:55:50.500
But you start a live talk show, I'll kill you.

02:55:50.500 --> 02:55:51.700
No, I'm just kidding.

02:55:51.700 --> 02:55:53.860
I'm kidding.

02:55:53.860 --> 02:55:55.420
Because they were voting for the song

02:55:55.420 --> 02:55:56.660
they wanted you to sing, Loki.

02:55:56.660 --> 02:55:58.180
That's why I have all the PMs.

02:55:58.180 --> 02:56:00.180
It's one of the personal broadcaster packages,

02:56:00.180 --> 02:56:04.340
And it's reasonable, I guess, although I don't like the idea of having to pay to do this

02:56:04.340 --> 02:56:05.340
show.

02:56:05.340 --> 02:56:06.340
But whatever.

02:56:06.340 --> 02:56:08.540
We had fun doing it and that's what it's all about.

02:56:08.540 --> 02:56:12.340
EvilMalkey2Dx would like to know, when are you coming over to clean my house and the

02:56:12.340 --> 02:56:13.900
plumbing?

02:56:13.900 --> 02:56:20.660
Anytime in the place, baby.

02:56:20.660 --> 02:56:21.660
That's it.

02:56:21.660 --> 02:56:23.980
I'm out of questions unless somebody else wants to send along a new question.

02:56:23.980 --> 02:56:28.660
Actually we probably should start to get wrapping up the show pretty soon here.

02:56:28.660 --> 02:56:32.660
I'm having a lot of people ask me for a copy of the karaoke revolution segment.

02:56:32.660 --> 02:56:35.020
What do you guys think we ought to do with that?

02:56:35.020 --> 02:56:41.940
I'm thinking burn it, sell it on Ebay, the highest bidder, Kazaa, put it on Kazaa, we'll

02:56:41.940 --> 02:56:42.940
see what happens.

02:56:42.940 --> 02:56:44.780
I think it could be a good promotion show.

02:56:44.780 --> 02:56:52.020
Loki and I have been busting our butts trying to get a new website done and when we have

02:56:52.020 --> 02:56:58.500
that new website done in our downloads area we will put that up just for you guys.

02:56:58.500 --> 02:57:05.500
You know what? We should get ourselves a listeners club. An Orange Lounge listeners club. Yeah.

02:57:05.500 --> 02:57:11.060
Well, we have a message board, but none of us seem to use it, but it is over at calliebomani.com.

02:57:11.060 --> 02:57:14.860
If you click on the evil board of randomness. Unfortunately, our phones have been a little

02:57:14.860 --> 02:57:20.860
dead lately, but you can go there and revive them. We certainly wouldn't mind. I'm making

02:57:20.860 --> 02:57:27.860
a sexy pose for pixie dust right now. I was just showing off my pillowy lips. Alright,

02:57:29.940 --> 02:57:36.940
I guess we're going to close the mailbag now for Ask Orange Lounge. That was Orange Lounge

02:57:40.820 --> 02:57:46.540
or should I say Ask Orange Lounge. The segment's over now so don't send any more questions.

02:57:46.540 --> 02:57:50.540
We hope you learned something really useful.

02:57:50.540 --> 02:57:54.540
The show's over, so we're going to end the segment right now.

02:57:54.540 --> 02:57:58.540
All right.

02:57:58.540 --> 02:58:04.540
Now's the part of the show where we go around and we get everybody's final thoughts.

02:58:04.540 --> 02:58:07.540
Let's start with No Stalin.

02:58:07.540 --> 02:58:08.540
Thank you for coming tonight.

02:58:08.540 --> 02:58:10.540
No Stalin, no is your first show.

02:58:10.540 --> 02:58:12.540
Kind of an interesting show to have as your first show.

02:58:12.540 --> 02:58:14.540
I really like the show, you know.

02:58:14.540 --> 02:58:15.540
Good.

02:58:15.540 --> 02:58:21.540
them and me showing up. It's cool. Good times. Good times. Good times. G.T. like to say.

02:58:21.540 --> 02:58:35.540
Yes. Your mom. Thank you. Who thought that over? Pixie Dust, your final thought. I'm

02:58:35.540 --> 02:58:43.540
laying on the twenty-third or sixty-nine magnus in O's Island right now. I am such a slut,

02:58:43.540 --> 02:58:50.660
but only one comes home with me tonight well that's Rob yes that's me I get to

02:58:50.660 --> 02:58:57.540

02:58:57.540 --> 02:59:04.180
um let's see moving on um Magus your final thought for tonight why'd you have

02:59:04.180 --> 02:59:09.620
to go ahead make things so complicated your final thought for tonight I didn't

02:59:09.620 --> 02:59:18.020
think of one, damn you. I'm coming out. Oh my god, there's a milkshake! Milkshake! Cheeseburger!

02:59:18.020 --> 02:59:23.740
Loki, your final thought. I want to sing it to you. Here it comes. Loki's gonna sing his

02:59:23.740 --> 02:59:31.020
final thought tonight. Uh, no I'm not. Alright. I'm not gonna sing my final thought. Ah, I...

02:59:31.020 --> 02:59:33.020
The hell is this wrapped around?

02:59:33.020 --> 02:59:35.020
What the fuck?

02:59:35.020 --> 02:59:37.020
Anyways...

02:59:37.020 --> 02:59:39.020
Lisa's on my chair this time.

02:59:39.020 --> 02:59:41.020
Um...

02:59:41.020 --> 02:59:43.020
Please don't make me sing anywhere.

02:59:43.020 --> 02:59:45.020
I don't...

02:59:45.020 --> 02:59:47.020
We have an afterbirth coming up.

02:59:47.020 --> 02:59:49.020
I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.

02:59:49.020 --> 02:59:51.020
Fine! If they want to be tortured like that,

02:59:51.020 --> 02:59:53.020
their masochist in the goddamn chat room, fine.

02:59:53.020 --> 02:59:55.020
Alright.

02:59:55.020 --> 02:59:57.020
We'll see.

02:59:57.020 --> 02:59:59.020
Alright, uh, is that your final thought?

02:59:59.020 --> 03:00:07.460
My final thought is, wow, I almost peed when Loki sang. That was amazing. Loki has driven

03:00:07.460 --> 03:00:11.220
me to urinary movements in my body. That is amazing.

03:00:11.220 --> 03:00:17.180
The final word of tonight, thank you guys for being here next week on the show, season

03:00:17.180 --> 03:00:22.460
four premiere. Jamie's back in his house and will tell us all about our Alabama trip. DDR

03:00:22.460 --> 03:00:27.340
Ultra Mix is out on the shelves and we'll be giving our impressions if we get a chance

03:00:27.340 --> 03:00:33.660
to play it, actually, and more craziness. Tonight's final word I will give to Pixie

03:00:33.660 --> 03:00:39.660
Dust. It's the final word, the one word to sum up the entire show and leave us on.

03:00:39.660 --> 03:00:46.660
Twat. Clap. You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

03:00:46.980 --> 03:00:53.500
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sakura, Sky and Loki. We expect you a nice play again.

03:00:53.500 --> 03:00:56.260
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:00:56.260 --> 03:00:59.020
What I really like about the movies, I like the previews for some reason.

03:00:59.020 --> 03:01:00.020
I like to get there.

03:01:00.020 --> 03:01:01.020
I don't want to see just the movie when I get there.

03:01:01.020 --> 03:01:02.340
I got to see some previews first.

03:01:02.340 --> 03:01:06.700
I like that guy with that deep voice, like, smoke like 10 packs of cigarettes.

03:01:06.700 --> 03:01:10.980
One man, one way.

03:01:10.980 --> 03:01:14.440
One desire.

03:01:14.440 --> 03:01:16.080
They went too far.

03:01:16.080 --> 03:01:18.140
They broke all the rules.

03:01:18.140 --> 03:01:20.780
One man, Kermit the Frog as a pimp.

03:01:20.780 --> 03:01:21.780
Where's my money?

03:01:21.780 --> 03:01:26.920
Where is it?

03:01:26.920 --> 03:01:31.980
One man, one way.

03:01:31.980 --> 03:01:32.980
What a weird voice, Satan.

03:01:32.980 --> 03:01:35.780
That's the only thing that guy could do for a living, you know?

03:01:35.780 --> 03:01:37.380
He couldn't be a mechanic or anything.

03:01:37.380 --> 03:01:41.260
Hey, uh, how much is that transmission gonna cost me?

03:01:41.260 --> 03:01:44.700
An arm and a leg.

03:01:44.700 --> 03:01:50.420
Just imagine having sex with somebody, that'd be hilarious, you know?

03:01:50.420 --> 03:01:54.740
Oh yeah, the desire in your eyes.

03:01:54.740 --> 03:01:58.540
The passion between us burns with fire.

03:01:58.540 --> 03:02:01.540
Oh yeah, one way in, no way out.

03:02:01.540 --> 03:02:11.220
Oh, same babble.

03:02:11.220 --> 03:02:14.900
Jean-Claude Van Damme in the same crap

03:02:14.900 --> 03:02:21.900
you've seen over and over and over again

03:02:22.580 --> 03:02:27.860
I lived to be in one of those movies, I'd be like

03:02:27.860 --> 03:02:30.400
Crescent Heights was a peaceful community

03:02:30.400 --> 03:02:33.760
until Amy Andersono moved in

03:02:33.760 --> 03:02:35.580
Hello, I'm watching you Amy

03:02:35.580 --> 03:02:37.020
Oh my God!

03:02:37.020 --> 03:02:40.620
She went to the police but they couldn't help, I'm sorry I haven't done nothing wrong

03:02:40.620 --> 03:02:44.140
so she went to Detective Pablo Francisco

03:02:44.140 --> 03:02:49.360
what's going on he's trying to kill me Pablo double the action triple the

03:02:49.360 --> 03:02:56.800
