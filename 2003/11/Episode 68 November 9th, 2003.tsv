8914	13053	Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
16656	21538	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the mommy talk and then some.
22138	24839	Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.
25219	29241	Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.
29861	34663	Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.
35223	38944	You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
39265	40745	Yes, I will spank your child.
41145	42866	If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.
45543	49046	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
69482	76404	Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie.
77384	78084	Oh yeah?
78244	81625	Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.
81865	82905	DarkSakura.
83105	84025	I've got a sniff.
84265	84765	Skye.
84906	87026	But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.
87386	87886	Loki.
88166	89186	I hate you!
89607	91587	Orange Lounge Radio Arts.
92688	96991	We are live, and this is episode number 68 for November the 9th of 2003.
97172	106219	You're tuned in to the Vimani Scene's most, um, female challenger tonight, radio station of all things Vimani.
107159	108961	My name is Rob Robertson, you might know me as Sky.
109561	112243	Joining me, as always, are half of my awesome co-hosts.
112503	117848	In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers, is all the way in that corner that's in Alabama.
118468	120530	She's out tonight, she's on vacation, so...
122133	123634	So no Jamie tonight, sorry everybody.
124394	129576	But we have some more guests here to help kind of fill that void that Jamie has left.
129636	130317	Is this mic on?
130537	131557	Yes, the mic is on.
131897	132718	Yes, Lanky, stop.
133098	133298	What?
133818	134298	Testing.
134498	135179	There we go, yeah.
136099	137040	I told you it was on!
138960	139961	You question my authority?
140401	140761	Yeah.
140921	141822	You little poopy head.
142402	144183	In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.
145303	145703	Hello.
147264	147684	Hello.
150125	150866	Oh, that's an old one.
150906	151246	Oh, okay.
152596	153978	We're talking about Walmart again?
154458	155780	Oh no, I'm using an old script.
155820	157221	Do you hate Walmart still, Rob?
157602	158363	Do I hate Walmart?
158423	159183	I'll get into that later.
160445	161886	I have to have something to talk about tonight, Chris.
162887	167532	Also with us tonight we have, as you were already hearing him, because he just can't shut the fuck up.
167552	167933	Just kidding.
167953	169394	Say it a little Likey style.
169574	170275	Up the shut phone.
170495	173238	You know him probably if you listen to Vanilla Sky on Monday nights, right?
173639	173879	Yes.
173919	174660	Because he's always here.
175220	175861	I hope you know me.
175881	182568	Probably just like that annoying guy who always gives us his stupid opinions about how games are cool and some games aren't.
182908	183348	That's right.
183809	185310	Castlevania's cool and you all suck.
186572	186952	Thank you.
187913	192417	Also here tonight, say hello to Bradley, also known as Arcadian42.
192457	192598	Hi.
192938	193639	Hi, how are you?
194920	195200	Well.
196101	196201	Well.
197398	197838	All right.
198339	203063	Also, we have somebody who I don't think has ever been to the show in the house before.
203223	203523	No.
204384	207306	Has joined us for some of our live remotes, but never in the house.
207887	209288	Say hello to Vanders.
210129	210709	Mahalo.
211290	211810	How are you?
211830	213472	I am well, thank you.
213692	214272	That's good.
214332	215193	I'm glad you can make it.
215753	215994	Thanks.
216034	216854	I'm glad to be here.
216914	217795	This is exciting.
218296	220477	Our home base is exactly what I thought it would be.
220497	222339	Lots of anime, lots of DVDs, and lots of games.
222499	224381	And lots of crap everywhere, isn't it?
225399	226080	and SuperBacon.
226160	228382	That's alright, we love, yes and lots of SuperBacon.
229063	230604	And French bread pizza for me tonight.
231325	231645	Mm-mm.
232086	232346	Yummy.
233147	237151	Brad says he needs to be careful because he might trip and fall and eat that pizza!
237832	239874	And I'll bash his head in if he does.
242476	245880	That, that French bread pizza needs to be in my belly, dammit.
246769	256313	Alright, tonight we're going to play some music from the Poppin' 10, Poppin' Music Part 10 soundtrack for our breaks, because I know you guys have been wanting to hear some of the new stuff.
257393	262315	During this break we're going to hear a brand new Mr. T song doing the Goonies Are Good Enough.
262775	265196	This is awesome.
265256	266016	It is awesome.
266056	266977	You're outvoted, Loki.
267557	272999	Also in this break we're going to hear an artist called Noki Nokio with a song called Pata Pata Mama.
274482	276725	Hatsa Pata Mama is the name of the song we're going to hear second.
277106	281272	And then also in this break, we're going to hear a really cool remix of Murmur Twins.
281793	285639	Yes, Poppin' Music 10 has a guitar remix of Murmur Twins, and we're going to hear that in this break too.
285759	287502	So enjoy, we'll be back.
287682	289004	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
409548	418934	9 o'clock, I'm a do-pa-ta-pa-ta, noisy 7 o'clock, hot pot, car-o-car-o, kitchen 8 o'clock, I'm a do-pa-ta-pa-ta, noisy 9 o'clock, I'm a do-pa-ta-pa-ta, noisy
434657	442486	Baby Settaku, Boi Boi Switch on, 11 o'clock, I want to go to the bathroom.
442686	445169	12 o'clock, I want to go to the bathroom.
445269	446750	Ah, it's beautiful.
458160	459661	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
498852	499893	Thank you for watching!
561705	561886	and more.
607140	611281	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
611522	613002	Extreme Bobani Radio.
613022	616783	That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
632725	634946	Hello, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
635787	638848	And that was some music from the new Poppin' Music Part 10.
639529	641870	God, I can't believe that game has gotten that high, all the way to 10.
642470	645092	That's more than I think any other Bomani game has gotten yet.
646192	648974	What is it about Poppin' Music that makes it so damn popular?
650034	650535	Any thoughts?
655457	656898	Yeah, get a microphone, Loki.
657118	658199	Come on, say it again.
659585	663062	Because retards like smashing their heads into large round buttons.
665074	666595	I'm not quite sure why it's so popular.
666615	676463	I guess maybe just the music is more popular over there than, say, 2DX's music seems to be more popular over here, from my little sphere of influence.
677344	678225	I personally, I don't know.
678785	693457	Since there's so much music in pop music, since there's ten versions now, plus the anime level ones, yeah, there's a lot of good tracks, but overall I think the majority of the music isn't my style, whereas 2DX is more my type of thing, more of a dancey, techno, trancey...
694986	698010	You and your, you know, rectangular buttons.
698391	701315	Yeah, I know, not the big round tap light ones.
701375	704500	Instead, I've got little, little tiny, like, keys, you know.
704840	708145	Well, your character, your game doesn't have any characters dancing around.
709026	710709	Well, in some of the videos it does.
713167	714067	I have all of them.
729741	730441	I don't know, it's crazy.
730981	741184	I was just looking at, um, Navi was over at a little gathering we were having last night, and, uh, Navi, um, who's been on the show before, he's kind of known as the local Papa Music whore, and he buys everything relating to Papa Music.
741204	742944	He bought this new Papa Music calendar.
743304	746345	Okay, this new calendar is like the size of a small poster.
746405	748225	It's not the size of your typical calendar, it's bigger.
748566	753527	It's like the size of a small poster, not a huge wall poster, but like a, like a fold-out poster type thing.
753567	754327	It's, it's pretty big.
754967	760331	and the cover of it has every single character from Poppin' Music and it's like looking at a Where's Waldo picture.
760491	762493	Honestly, there's so many people just packed in there.
762813	764894	It's kind of like, I want to find this one.
764914	767776	I want to find the girl that looks like she's flicking her clit in that one song.
768096	770618	And I'm looking and it's like playing Where's Waldo.
770638	772039	There's so damn many characters.
772680	775542	And yes, I swear to God, there is a girl that looks like she's flicking her clit in one song.
775862	776402	Just wanted to share.
776863	779244	No, it looks more like she's smoking out of her pussy.
779304	780405	She keeps going like this.
780505	781326	You know how people smoke?
781366	783667	I'm doing the sign with the two fingers out like a peace sign.
783687	784228	They're smoking.
785095	788957	The best, though, is the character Liddell, who is in, I believe it's Poppin' Music 8.
788997	791879	I think it's 7 or 8, I can't remember, but it's a song called Galaxy Forest.
791899	792519	I think it's 8 too.
803021	803522	No, you know what?
803542	806504	I think it's 7, because I think I've known of Liddell for a while.
806925	815153	Okay, so I think it's one of the consumer tracks from 7 is Galaxy Forest, and there's this chick Liddell who looks like a sheepherder, but like with no face and just two little lighting eyes.
815473	817815	So kind of like a black mage, like if you imagine Vivi, right?
818156	820078	It's like Vivi is a sheepherder, but a girl.
820378	825263	And like she wears a skirt, but if she loses, like rats fly out of her cooch.
827065	829106	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
857990	859851	Anyway, sorry.
860071	864832	So I thought maybe we could go through these songs we just played and see what you guys think of them.
865313	868934	We haven't really ever done that with new songs, but, you know, we're desperate for material tonight.
868954	871995	So let's see, what do you guys think of Mr. T with Goonies Are Good Enough?
873235	873875	Crap!
874035	878657	Crap, crap, crap, crap.
878857	880037	You think this is crap?
880518	881118	It is crap.
881138	882018	You're crap.
882298	884059	Let me just play some MIDI for you.
884719	886160	We don't even do anything with it.
886180	886940	We just play MIDI.
890717	892518	Okay, that's your opinion.
893358	899701	This song brings me back to my days when I was a little kid and used to play Goose 2 on Nintendo.
900401	901281	Oh, it's awesome.
901482	909225	I've always liked Mr. T, but he's been bringing out some cool stuff ever since, like, I don't know, Burning Heat and stuff like that.
909305	910845	So, good stuff.
911166	916128	It just reminds me of kind of like Akira Yamaoka's feel of his little 8-bit sounding music and stuff.
916548	917888	I have a question for Loki.
917908	919309	Do you consider this crap funny?
923513	923813	Yes.
924974	925795	Wait a minute.
925915	926916	You like this song.
926956	928057	I've seen you play it before.
929358	930258	Yeah, like once.
931179	931399	Ass.
931740	932780	You don't like that song?
933875	937097	To me, Goonies Are Good Enough is just like, it's kind of like the next chapter.
937117	945143	That song right there, that has actual synthesizers and stuff in it, and it actually looks like, you know, they spent more than two minutes on it, okay?
945624	949727	Whereas the Goonies song is just like, oh, let's play it straight off Nintendo.
950147	952669	And no, it wasn't hard for him to do that.
952969	955671	All he did was just throw it into a MIDI player and go.
956512	957472	Okay, here's my next question.
957492	958173	What do you think of this?
964648	965289	See, that's better.
968032	970656	You gotta keep it with those Faggots!
972378	982931	Well, if you're gonna play a faggoty song anyways, at least play it so it sounds like a faggoty song instead of faggoty 8-bit shit.
985367	990151	The opinions and whatever of Loki do not... Yeah, you get it.
990631	991172	No, I don't care.
991212	992172	I'm gay and I think it's funny.
992453	998057	So, um... We all know Loki's type.
998257	999378	Type with the queers.
999418	1000999	He loves his queers.
1001059	1002540	No, I love my goonies, okay?
1002741	1004022	He's friendly.
1005781	1016548	I love Goonies, that movie rocks And to totally take that song and just take a huge dump on it It's just awful But doesn't that song, isn't it even remotely retro to you?
1016609	1019371	Didn't you ever play the Goonies 2 on Nintendo?
1020211	1021732	No, that doesn't exist.
1021952	1024013	She turned into a fucking mermaid.
1024053	1027015	Come on, that does not exist.
1027696	1032959	I've read online that people think that that song is the Goonies 2 song just lifted from the game.
1033259	1036521	Okay, I hate to break it to you, but 8-Bit sounded a lot worse than that.
1036561	1037902	So that has been redone.
1038302	1040703	Now, to me, not enough in my opinion.
1040804	1041124	Shut up.
1041464	1046067	That song is to Goonies 2 like Burning Heat was to Gradius 2.
1047136	1049338	To me, that's just kind of the next chapter of the Burning Heat.
1049438	1052481	It's taking another old-school Konami theme and redoing it.
1052781	1058125	So let's all hope to God the next Mr. T tackles Castlevania 2, because I would poop my pants.
1059046	1059787	Oh my God.
1061108	1062669	Here's the thing I've always been pissed off about.
1062729	1066532	Akumajou Dracula Medley from, what is it, Keyboard Mania 2nd?
1066572	1066753	Yeah.
1068388	1073211	is like already perfectly suited for Guitar Freaks and Drone Mania session, and it never showed up.
1073231	1078875	It's got the, you know, come on man, more Castlevania music in Romani games, please.
1080296	1082357	No more Gradius, or Goonies.
1085289	1086310	The music in Gradius was cool.
1104741	1110164	Roller Games, stupid rollerblading or, you know, roller derby type game that they made.
1110745	1113106	Or, yeah, Rush Attack or Metal Gear the Original.
1113146	1116969	They always had pretty good music for, like, the hardware that they were putting it on.
1118069	1119550	And, yeah, Gradius' music was cool.
1119610	1121572	Even the 2DX songs are very good and stuff.
1121632	1123333	But I want Castlevania music.
1125174	1127175	And if you haven't played it yet, go play the new Castlevania.
1127215	1127635	Good stuff.
1127796	1128376	Get the soundtrack.
1128396	1128936	It's awesome.
1129777	1131458	Do they actually have a CD soundtrack for that?
1132126	1161052	uh, Japan will, we won't um, the game came out here in America first and they're gonna release it over there like a month later with a CD soundtrack and like tons of freaking collectibles and stuff cause we don't get that cool stuff over here damn you, Konami of America yeah, here we stupid Americans we not good enough for collector edition oh well any other thoughts on Goonies are Good Enough?
1162543	1162763	Okay.
1163725	1164405	Uh, it was crap.
1165206	1166889	Hey, I think those Goonies were good enough.
1169632	1170453	That's better than the movie.
1170473	1173076	That song should have been in the movie.
1173537	1175560	Like, I don't know, like, just like that.
1176341	1178003	Weird synthesizer sounding and stuff.
1179192	1179973	Here, talk.
1180613	1181874	Alright, let's go to the next song.
1181975	1185037	I had to play this just because of the name alone.
1185057	1187379	This is a song called Pata Pata Mama.
1187399	1188741	This is the next song we played on that break.
1189041	1194726	What do you think of this one?
1196968	1197749	What do you think of this one?
1197789	1200631	Now we know why those schoolgirls jumped in front of the train.
1203974	1204955	That bad, huh?
1206147	1211571	I think it's cute, in a poppin' music way, and only a way that poppin' music can be.
1211752	1212152	That song is cute.
1212172	1220018	Poppin' music belongs in the Twilight Zone, because seriously, it has like the worst music ever, and then, yet, they keep releasing more sequels for it.
1222941	1225102	Alright, whatever you say.
1225363	1230787	Okay, and then next was a remix of Murmur Twins, the guitar version of Murmur Twins.
1231387	1231728	I don't know
1237827	1238248	Come on.
1238268	1239390	Hey, that's acceptable.
1240151	1240872	Oh, wow.
1241373	1245100	I was expecting something, you know, angsty from him.
1245120	1246222	I like Murmur Twins.
1246583	1247224	Good, good.
1247244	1250990	But I don't like, you know, Shitty Middy and whatever the fuck that other one was.
1252830	1253931	Yeah, I don't even know what the other one was.
1253951	1254431	Screw that.
1254491	1255392	But yeah, this is good.
1255972	1257153	DJW is awesome.
1257574	1262037	Murmur Twins, Spica, Linus, all the cool stuff he's done.
1262057	1268662	Murmur Twins has probably always been my favorite of his, so this is pretty cool that they actually remixed it and such.
1269442	1271664	Just don't do like a trance remix of it ever, please.
1273846	1278669	I imagine that'll probably be in the next 2DX, because remember how Night Style was just like remix hell?
1278929	1282092	Like everything was just remixed and the shit out of it in Night Style?
1284366	1284946	Well, I don't know.
1284986	1295013	I think DJW's little forte is using kind of like keyboards and piano a lot, almost like an Osamu Kubota-ish, but not as classical sounding.
1295073	1297954	And so I don't think they would do like a trancy version, really.
1298775	1299115	I don't know.
1299615	1303318	Then again, Moonchild is kind of different from his other stuff, so whatever.
1305759	1306079	All right.
1306700	1308601	So any other thoughts on Murmur Twins?
1308941	1309241	Anyone?
1309982	1310182	All right.
1311189	1315070	Hello to Slinky, by the way, who showed up while we were talking about all the poppin' music stuff.
1315110	1316031	How are you, sir?
1319592	1319812	Hi.
1320292	1320572	Hi.
1322213	1322573	Excellent.
1322993	1323553	That's good.
1323633	1325154	So you drove yourself here tonight, huh?
1325854	1326634	Yeah.
1326674	1327734	Congratulations.
1328175	1328515	Thanks.
1328875	1330375	Did Mommy and Daddy buy you a car?
1332096	1332336	Yes.
1332556	1333296	Spoiled brat!
1333976	1334297	Thank you.
1336721	1337001	You know what?
1337582	1340904	Actually, my mom and dad were going to give me an old car of theirs, too, when I got my license.
1341304	1343626	Only, we had a big flood, and it drowned.
1343646	1345087	It drowned?
1345107	1345507	It drowned.
1345527	1346208	The car drowned.
1347028	1347128	Oh.
1348209	1350071	Yeah, so, I'm just bitter.
1350171	1350671	Don't listen to me.
1351031	1353373	Maybe you shouldn't have living cars anymore, then.
1354714	1356155	No, my car, it died.
1356335	1359917	And when you turn the key in, it won't start anymore, because, you know, there's mud everywhere.
1359938	1361258	It's dead.
1361359	1361619	Dead.
1365541	1368645	You shouldn't drive the car into the river again then, maybe.
1368685	1370787	No, I did not drive the car into the river.
1370827	1371848	My dad parked it
1375084	1379727	He parked it near a creek, which is typical because there's a parking lot next to this creek.
1379747	1380808	And what do you do in parking lots?
1380828	1381549	You park your car.
1381569	1382429	So that's what he did.
1382890	1384591	No, he did not park his car in the creek.
1384651	1390616	He parked his car next to the creek, and then it rained like, what, 8 inches in 24 hours or something fucking crazy?
1391216	1397941	No, this was in 1995 when California had those huge floods and President Clinton came out here and everything, and the car just floated away.
1398662	1401444	Too bad the floods didn't sweep him away when he was out here.
1403928	1404428	I cried.
1404468	1405529	But my car now is cool.
1406069	1408650	Actually, the car I was supposed to have was a Ford Explorer.
1409011	1410471	It was a 92 Ford Explorer.
1410892	1415674	And my friends and I always called it the Jurassic Park car because it was the same car they used in Jurassic Park.
1415754	1420577	And, you know, we always used to get in the car and go... I know.
1420737	1421337	We were dorks.
1421457	1422118	What can I say?
1423138	1424439	No, actually, it never got old.
1424459	1425619	Kill yourself now.
1426420	1426680	Awful.
1435719	1437619	I hope a dinosaur eats you while you're on the crapper.
1440160	1441940	Oh, Jurassic Park 4 was awesome.
1442921	1444241	There was no Jurassic Park 4.
1445321	1446341	There was no Jurassic Park 4.
1446662	1447662	That's what's so great about it.
1455384	1456144	I know, I know.
1457084	1458364	But I do, I miss my car.
1458384	1460545	You know whenever I think about my car I get all nostalgic?
1466209	1467189	Why do you have this?
1469810	1471370	Are you a Closet Jurassic Park fan?
1471390	1472410	Do you like dinosaurs?
1473090	1473891	Pink dinosaurs?
1477111	1479432	No, I just happen to like John Williams.
1479452	1481732	I happen to like John Williams, is that so wrong?
1481852	1485513	I reorganized my MP3 collection not too long ago.
1486253	1488234	That's right, John Williams is one of the greatest composers ever.
1491064	1493384	They are really making a Jurassic Park 4, though, you do know.
1493665	1496185	You do know this, because Jurassic Park 3 did really, really well.
1496265	1497865	So, of course, there'll be a Jurassic Park 4.
1498385	1499106	It did well?
1499666	1500946	I didn't know anybody who saw it.
1501906	1502186	Really.
1502206	1508847	I would only see it because William H. Macy's in it, that's all.
1509768	1510588	What the hell?
1511968	1515389	Look, Thanos is showing... What is that?
1515589	1516589	Are they raccoons?
1519977	1521418	Hold on, get this on the mic.
1529444	1530585	Is this Satan worshipping?
1530645	1531825	I don't... This is weird.
1531865	1533347	It sounds like Silent Hill music.
1535748	1536189	Excuse me.
1537610	1538050	I'm dying.
1539671	1541172	Too much nostalgia is bad for me.
1541192	1542233	Anyway.
1543314	1543554	Anyway.
1544619	1549103	Why don't you post the link to that badger thing in the chat room so if they... Oh, did they get... Oh, okay.
1549443	1550444	Oh, somebody else put it in there.
1550504	1550764	I see.
1550965	1551225	I see.
1551605	1551885	Okay.
1552346	1553047	Oh, I see what happened.
1553747	1554668	It's all Wampa's fault.
1555048	1555369	I get it.
1555989	1556229	Alright.
1558752	1561374	Do the badgers ever do anything other than just stand there and dance?
1562575	1562955	No, they just badger.
1562975	1563636	Oh, they just badger.
1563656	1564076	That's cute.
1564657	1565077	That's cute.
1569013	1580579	Random Snake, that's good Okay, now this is a part of the show where we usually like to kick off the show with this But, you know, we're a little late tonight, oh well I thought we'd play a little bit of How was your week, how was your day?
1581760	1585542	This is the part of the show where we go around and ask everybody How was your week, how was your day?
1586482	1589544	Loki How was your week, how was your day?
1597127	1598148	I think that mic is off, Loki
1603690	1605592	I think you're disconnected then, because I'm not hearing it.
1609657	1610117	Damn it!
1610137	1610398	Damn you!
1610418	1610798	Damn you!
1610898	1612280	Alright, how was your week, how was your day, Loki?
1612921	1614342	I have bacon grease in my hands.
1615243	1615944	Anyways, um...
1618376	1618736	Let's see.
1618836	1622357	The only thing worth mentioning this week is I went and saw Matrix Revolutions.
1622437	1623098	It was okay.
1623878	1624278	It was good.
1625458	1627839	And I went and saw Elf yesterday.
1628319	1628859	That was good.
1630060	1634521	And... It looks like a movie that's going to be really manipulative, though.
1634681	1639363	It's going to have one of those crybaby endings and like family... Feel good, family fun.
1639463	1639663	Okay.
1640303	1650394	I don't know what it is with people making Christmas movies and thinking that at the end of every Christmas movie has to be, for some reason, you have to get the Christmas spirit and then everything is message.
1650854	1660625	It's like, the whole movie was good until they threw out like the, Oh, everyone must believe in Santa or else Christmas will not be saved!
1661025	1664387	You know, it's just so awful that they do stuff like that.
1664587	1665727	But the rest of the movie is awesome.
1666248	1668049	Yeah, why don't they make movies about real life?
1668929	1675292	Some people don't get to have Christmas because they're so poor and they don't get to eat but once a week and stuff.
1675572	1678394	That's a nice, uplifting Christmas story.
1678554	1680055	Okay, what about the Jews?
1681161	1681461	I don't know.
1681721	1683822	We'll go see the movie.
1684282	1687043	They had a part in the movie though where he's talking to Santa.
1687063	1698246	He's like, there's been rumors going around that parents are telling their children or that people are believing that their parents are putting the presents under the tree and they're all
1699400	1700381	How is that possible?
1700461	1702562	How would they even be able to do that in one night?
1703022	1703803	He's like, I know.
1704724	1705704	Then what about the cookies?
1706145	1707906	Do they think that they eat the cookies too?
1708286	1708986	I guess so.
1709367	1711408	They just said it so sarcastically it was funny.
1712629	1716351	Because there's no Santa Claus!
1716752	1718633	Thank you, Loki, ruining Christmas everywhere.
1719393	1724177	I'm not going to go and let my kids believe that there's this fake Santa Claus or Easter Bunny.
1724217	1726979	I'm going to make it a little more realistic for them.
1728210	1732854	Mom and Dad have to take out another loan on the house because you want your fucking presents, you little brats.
1733374	1733775	You know what?
1734355	1735656	This is a fun little side topic.
1735696	1737277	I want to pose this question to everybody in here.
1737958	1741901	How old were you when you found out there was no Santa Claus, and how did you react?
1743082	1746044	Loki, how old were you when you found out there was no Santa Claus, and how did you react?
1746905	1748086	Oh, damn, I don't even remember.
1748306	1749327	I just don't think I cared.
1749347	1751328	I was getting presents anyways.
1751889	1754511	I don't know.
1755452	1755952	All right, Brad.
1757406	1761408	I think it was like four or five, you know, as far as I can remember.
1761849	1763089	And I reacted pretty well.
1763109	1767191	I was like, oh, cool, a new 4-0 hidden in my mom's closet.
1769333	1770193	So I took it pretty well.
1772274	1772674	Vambos?
1774215	1775776	What are you guys talking about, there's no Santa Claus?
1778408	1781729	And that was like a big joke, isn't it?
1782229	1784329	Yeah, that's what we do on the radio.
1784369	1784869	We kid.
1784969	1785489	I kid.
1785550	1786090	I kid.
1786710	1791311	Anyways, I actually found out because my parents told me they got tired of trying to play it off like there was.
1791371	1792511	And so they said, hey, you know what?
1792531	1794431	We just put the presents under the tree for you.
1795752	1797532	So I'm kind of jaded about that kind of stuff.
1798312	1802613	So that's why my kids don't think there's a Santa Claus either because that's all kind of... He's a silly little red elf.
1802973	1819437	I was about to say, since you actually have kids who are of the age where they're not babies, they're toddlers now and they're thinking about Santa Claus and all that, did you try the Santa Claus thing with them or did you just say, screw it, you know what kids, I'm going to tell you a secret.
1819477	1822098	The other kids are going to try to feed you this Santa crap.
1823318	1824318	That's pretty essentially it.
1824338	1826299	We told them, you know, he's a funny little elf.
1826843	1830366	All he does is beg for money to give to the Red Cross, that greedy bastard.
1830386	1830526	Uh, Will.
1847441	1849922	I know you're the youngest one here, but the news has been broken, yes?
1850322	1850842	I'm just kidding.
1850882	1851242	I'm kidding.
1851262	1851703	Of course.
1852343	1853523	How old were you and how did you react?
1854584	1855184	I don't know.
1855204	1857545	I was probably like nine or ten.
1858245	1859245	I can't really remember.
1862326	1863187	Oh, presents.
1864267	1865507	You didn't care because you were still getting presents?
1866168	1867308	Yeah.
1867328	1868488	It wasn't a huge shock.
1868508	1873190	I mean, by that age, it's not very believable anymore anyways.
1875291	1875551	I see.
1876206	1878707	The logistics of it just is what clued me in on it.
1878747	1883328	I'm like, how can a fat fuck fit down the goddamn, you know, chimney anyways?
1884009	1885549	So he uses his magic powers.
1885869	1886950	Oh, yeah, magic powers.
1887210	1888330	Isn't that convenient?
1889951	1891671	All right, Bradley, want to share?
1893252	1893952	I don't really remember.
1894432	1897813	It was like round five or six, maybe, and my sister told me.
1898374	1898614	Okay.
1901215	1902255	I don't think I was really shocked.
1903613	1907196	You know, that sounds very like you, Bradley, where you just would have been, okay.
1909037	1910018	I'm kind of surprised by that.
1910038	1911318	You didn't, like, become emotional?
1915041	1925989	I was five years old when I found out because my mom just started putting the presents under the tree that said, From Santa, under the tree on the 23rd, because she was just getting lazy and she didn't want to play the game anymore.
1926029	1929111	And I was kind of like, why does Santa and you have the same handwriting?
1930219	1931200	and she'd just ignore me.
1931540	1933602	How come the presents are under the tree on the 23rd?
1933963	1936846	How come the cookies are still gone and we have to leave them out on the 24th?
1937026	1939568	How come the reindeer hooves look just like the rabbit hooves?
1939809	1944573	Because I was totally that kind of kid where like whenever anybody would try to tell me something I'd be all, why?
1945054	1945394	Why?
1945835	1946095	Why?
1946275	1947877	I was that annoying little shit.
1949790	1951671	Do you want to know what I did?
1951691	1951771	Why?
1951791	1954813	I was real into, like, spying and all that cool shit, you know?
1955473	1957054	So what I had... I am not surprised.
1957134	1957494	I am not surprised.
1957514	1973523	So what I had is I had, um, ultraviolet pens, and I marked all the packages that were hidden in the closet to prove or not if they were from Santa or whatever, because they would... They didn't want to mark who they were for or who they were from, so they can get the from Santa ones, and you take my little ultraviolet light, and you go, Ha!
1973543	1973583	Ha!
1973983	1974844	You tried to trick me?
1975224	1976485	I saw right through it.
1978843	1980565	Loki Everett, Conspiracy Theorist.
1981045	1982066	Oh my God.
1983788	1988172	My parents used to leave the tags on the presents because they wanted to be able to return them.
1989413	1995900	And so when I saw that Santa Claus shopped at the commissary on base, wow, he really saved some money doing that.
1996040	1996600	I thought he made them.
1997561	1999583	That's a nice revelation there.
1999844	2000644	Santa's military.
2000684	2001205	I didn't know that.
2003393	2005614	Wow, what a nice sweater from Santa.
2005734	2008575	I didn't know Santa's workshop was called Mervins.
2010936	2013877	And why isn't Santa, you know, contributing to the U.S.
2013937	2014477	economy?
2014637	2018899	I mean, if he's, like, using all this elf labor and stuff, do they have unions?
2018919	2025121	I mean, because he's making a lot of, you know, knockoff goods and stuff and selling them, calling them, you know, name brand.
2025181	2025641	Yeah, I know.
2025801	2026461	It's not very nice.
2027722	2029482	Walmart kind of reminds me of the North Pole.
2032051	2032331	Really?
2032371	2033712	The North Pole has hicks?
2037573	2040974	You can't find a fucking place to park at the North Pole on a Saturday.
2040994	2044115	Alright, I'm sorry.
2044356	2044836	I'm sorry, Loki.
2044856	2047097	You want to finish talking to us about how your week and how your day was?
2047217	2050058	You saw Matrix, you saw... I saw the Matrix and I saw Elf.
2050178	2050798	Elf was cool.
2051518	2053419	I watched half of the Matrix the other day.
2053439	2055060	I was kind of looking over your shoulder.
2055080	2056000	Thanks to piracy.
2057793	2068265	Thanks to Piracy, because you know, all those methods that they put watermarking the goddamn film and checking people's bags and stuff, you can see it's totally put a stop to piracy.
2068305	2075633	You know what, it's one of those things where I wanted to try it before I buy it, and I tried it, and I've decided, you know what, I think I'll just watch the other half at home.
2077475	2078935	You know, here's what it is.
2079015	2084377	It's like, you know, I'm sorry, I don't want to go to the theater and pay $18 every time I go see a movie.
2084977	2086257	I'm going to watch it once in the theater.
2086277	2087637	Wait a minute, wait a minute.
2088017	2089138	You pay for your date?
2090758	2090958	Yeah.
2091978	2092338	Wow.
2096459	2097499	You guys are going to hell.
2099040	2100020	You're stealing from...
2100976	2104800	I saw Kill Bill three times in the theater to make up for it, so...
2113851	2114951	Fuck the DeWitchowski Brothers!
2115231	2117332	Or Warner Brothers Entertainment for a while.
2117352	2118112	Fuck the Warner Brothers!
2118992	2121353	They've made almost one billion dollars on the franchise.
2121393	2122273	They can go to hell.
2123013	2123634	I don't really care.
2124054	2129115	And they spent about one billion dollars making all the second and third movies.
2130155	2131916	Think of all the starving children that could have fed.
2132936	2134096	Yeah, like Keanu Reeves.
2137017	2138737	Yeah, think of all the acting classes he could have gone to.
2139978	2140478	Oh, that's funny.
2140918	2141038	Here.
2142145	2146510	Well, if anything, I want to see the Wachowski brothers take on Bill and Ted 3, okay?
2147111	2148072	That's what they need to make.
2148412	2152337	That's all that he's good at, just bring it back, bring it back to old school.
2153939	2157823	Yeah, seriously, just have it like Bill and Ted do something, you know, 3.
2159806	2160787	But anyways, um...
2162754	2163535	So what else did I do?
2163755	2165877	Oh, I made two more remixes, the only other was tonight.
2166337	2172602	And I did a live show last night, you know, an impromptu Livewire show at like 1 in the morning.
2173963	2176065	And that was cool, because I was bored.
2176906	2182510	And I tricked the chat room into thinking I was a person called Death by Syrup from Canada.
2183371	2185634	And they should have known right there that that was your super bacon.
2185875	2186275	Right there.
2186295	2187797	Because that was the bacon you made tonight.
2188198	2188338	Right?
2188378	2188578	No.
2189019	2193626	Well, I got the syrup idea from seeing Elf because he, like, would drink syrup.
2194146	2194347	So...
2195871	2196692	No, that's good.
2196812	2197732	Serb shots, man.
2197772	2198733	I want to do some of those.
2199133	2199813	Oh, my God.
2199874	2201174	We did the Serb shots.
2201414	2202075	We went to LA.
2202215	2204316	Yeah, we went to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.
2204376	2206638	It was right after CyberZone, the big tournament there.
2206678	2213042	A bunch of us went over to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffle, and it was like, what, me, Brad, Irene, Mel B. It was everybody.
2213062	2213962	Who else was at our table?
2213982	2214943	Tons of Bay Area people.
2214963	2217204	But it was mostly our table that did the Serb shots.
2217284	2220346	You, me, Irene, Fury, I think was there.
2220406	2220907	Fury, yeah.
2221167	2222648	Wendell, Mel B. Wendell and Mel B.
2223508	2230851	Damn, and it was just this, they give you these little, like, shot glasses full of syrup, and it's like warm syrup to put on your waffles and chicken.
2231511	2233152	Nice, warm, gooey, gooey butter.
2233172	2241516	But the thing is, since it's warm, if you've ever cooked, like, soup or something that's, like, thick, when you're heating it up, it starts to create a film on top that gets kind of hard.
2242096	2243396	That's what happened to this syrup.
2243436	2246738	So you had the nice little, it's almost like a tequila shot with the worm in it.
2247498	2249579	It's a hard thing of syrup.
2250039	2251160	And if you've ever had, like, a...
2252463	2255164	Cough syrup that coats your mouth or your throat as it goes down.
2255504	2256964	Think of that times like a hundred.
2257244	2260825	And that's how the syrup, you can taste it for like the next day.
2260865	2262266	It's still there.
2263146	2264246	I still taste it now.
2264626	2266147	But it's good because it gives me memories.
2266207	2267267	It gives me memories about it.
2267327	2267827	Shut up!
2268367	2272769	Yeah, I jizzed in yours before you drank it.
2272789	2274989	Give the mic back to Loki.
2275069	2277610	Give the mic back to Loki so he can finish telling us about his weakness day.
2279909	2284777	And then today I played more Zelda, but I really don't see a point because I forgot where I was in the game.
2285278	2286801	So I don't know what the hell I'm doing.
2286821	2290447	I'm just kind of like going island to island going, well, maybe I'm supposed to go here.
2290467	2291028	I don't know.
2294062	2305186	Now, I also have Mario Kart Double Dash on my PC, but in order to play it on the GameCube here, Rob needs to find his copy of Phantasy Star Online.
2305366	2311148	Because you can use Phantasy Star Online to play any pirated game on the GameCube.
2312268	2313588	So, yeah.
2314429	2314769	That's it.
2314869	2315149	I'm done.
2316549	2320270	Alright, I guess I'll ask Brad, since he kept butting in on that last one.
2320310	2321311	How was your week and how was your day?
2321331	2321771	You already know.
2323157	2324077	But our listeners don't.
2324397	2324898	Like they care.
2325038	2325518	Oh, come on.
2326338	2336522	Uh, I went out in last week, I believe it was, went out and used my wonderful Circuit City credit card and bought a PS2, an American one, because I haven't had one for the longest time.
2336562	2337502	I only had a Japanese one.
2337562	2340043	So I got that in Castlevania because I was fiending.
2340123	2343124	I had to finish Castlevania because I've been bumming it off of you guys here.
2344585	2345685	That's alright, I had to buy it.
2346145	2348326	Matt's saying he'd loan it to me, but that's fine.
2349281	2351001	So I bought it and finished it up.
2351061	2356222	I beat it pretty much every different way you can except for crazy mode because it's crazy and whatnot.
2357103	2358663	I beat it with the two hidden characters.
2359683	2366045	Like four hours is all it took me to beat it with the second hidden character and three hours is all it took me for the first hidden character.
2366245	2367725	You can go through it so freaking fast.
2368525	2369905	Anyhow, so got that.
2370746	2373666	I've got a job interview tomorrow so I will have a life for once.
2374646	2375086	Finally.
2376167	2376907	Yay for me.
2377007	2377647	Congratulations.
2379181	2383767	Yeah, I'm going to work for the man, so... And that's pretty much it.
2383807	2395101	We had a friend over from... Old school friend over for, you know, the weekend and watched movies and... And you got Best Strangers with Candy DVD, so we watched that.
2396162	2396443	Oh my god.
2398547	2402471	Please, this is my highest recommendation I could ever give a DVD.
2402931	2406495	Go out and buy The Strangers with Candy Season 1 and Season 2 box sets.
2406715	2409178	I almost peed my pants at that episode we watched last night.
2409198	2411680	Oh my god, that was one of the most disturbing things I've done so far.
2411740	2415164	It was the most morbid thing I think I've ever seen on a broadcast television show.
2415304	2416765	Well, it's cable, whatever, basic cable.
2417046	2418727	But still, it's... It was great.
2418947	2419508	It was great.
2420049	2421930	I don't even want to describe it because I don't want to ruin it, but...
2422831	2424632	One of the funniest shows I've ever seen.
2425273	2426253	Seriously.
2426753	2429195	Loki, we'll watch it after tonight's show.
2429735	2431656	We'll watch that episode because it's just great.
2432617	2436599	I had to go to the bathroom from laughing so hard after the ending of that one.
2436619	2444904	Yeah, it was like 2 or 3 in the morning and you're like waking up our neighbors.
2444944	2446465	I have an infectious laugh, what can I say?
2446505	2448346	Eddie was pretty loud too when he laughed, so...
2449818	2450438	I love Eddie's laugh.
2450458	2451338	I'm sure we'll talk about this.
2451358	2454019	I wish Eddie was here tonight so I could make him laugh so you guys could hear.
2454039	2459020	I'm sure we'll talk about this later, but we also sang karaoke.
2459360	2459880	Yeah, we'll get to that.
2459900	2460320	We'll get to that.
2460340	2460740	We'll get to that.
2460760	2461000	Yeah.
2461460	2461881	Yeah, we'll.
2461961	2463681	That's a good topic right there.
2463741	2464181	Next segment.
2464201	2464661	We'll get to that.
2464721	2464961	Yes.
2465121	2466221	I'm awful.
2466261	2467262	So am I, but anyway.
2467962	2468182	Okay.
2468942	2470722	Anything else you want to say about your week?
2471643	2476964	And I started playing Final Fantasy X because I am way freaking behind all you people who have played it already.
2477384	2477864	Good for you.
2479753	2480233	I quit.
2480433	2481734	Final Fantasy XI's taken over.
2481894	2483154	I can't go back to Final Fantasy X now.
2483194	2483454	Yeah.
2484054	2486595	Hey, if I had Final Fantasy XI, I'd be playing that too, so.
2487295	2492336	But I don't, because I've got no money, so I'll just play Final Fantasy X until I beat it.
2492556	2492976	Good stuff.
2494296	2495856	And then I gotta play Kingdom Hearts, so.
2496277	2497637	Because I'm way behind on that too, so.
2497657	2497957	Yep.
2498457	2499917	Remind me, I gotta give that to you before you go.
2500177	2500897	Yes, give it to me.
2501578	2502218	Give it to me now!
2502238	2502938	Give it to me in the butt.
2503578	2503718	Ew.
2504218	2504538	Anyway.
2506219	2506479	Okay.
2506499	2508079	Stick your keyblade in my butt.
2509975	2511116	Anyway, is that it?
2512837	2513518	What else happened?
2513538	2514418	Did we do anything else?
2515699	2516480	Not that I remember.
2516800	2519342	We didn't do Vanilla Sky this week.
2519402	2520823	We took a week off of Vanilla Sky.
2521103	2525907	And by the way, on a rerun of Vanilla Sky, had our highest listener count ever on the show.
2526047	2527548	And it wasn't even on the right night.
2528229	2530451	That's why I know Jamie's show whoops mine in the ratings.
2530471	2532332	Because we moved to Tuesday for a night and boom!
2532712	2535253	Through the roof, there's a little ego stroking for Jamie.
2535333	2537494	Yeah, Jamie, if you're out there listening.
2537954	2541095	Wait, is somebody asking me if I'm going to play X2?
2541375	2542516	Or is somebody asking somebody else?
2543136	2545017	Well, let's pretend they're asking you.
2545237	2546477	You want to play Final Fantasy X2?
2546757	2548998	I was not interested at all when I saw this.
2549018	2549879	I was like, what the hell?
2549899	2553480	Let's just make the three main characters girls that dress weirdly and stuff.
2553980	2558583	But after reading about it and how they're going to have a job system and stuff like that, it sounds interesting.
2558843	2571330	I still, since I haven't gone through Final Fantasy X yet, I don't understand what the connection is, but I noticed a lot of the characters are missing from Final Fantasy X. Yeah, and they can piss my fat ass for not having Lulu, a playable character.
2571590	2573551	Well, Lulu's going to be in it, but she's not a playable character.
2574271	2575971	What I'm pissed off is, where's Oren?
2576231	2582573	And don't say, I know people are going to probably sit there in the chat room and spoil it for me, because you guys all suck.
2582893	2585433	Yeah, remember, Brad and I have not beat Final Fantasy X yet.
2585774	2589794	I've picked up on some things that might be happening, but let's not spoil, okay?
2589815	2591035	Because I don't know.
2591155	2593135	So I will play it if you were asking me.
2593175	2594816	If you weren't asking me, I don't fucking care.
2595036	2595356	Fuck you.
2595996	2597037	I'll tell you my opinion anyway.
2598578	2598798	Sorry.
2599078	2599479	That's alright.
2599499	2600099	I'm really not curious.
2600159	2601560	I'm just angsty in real life.
2601620	2602060	No, you are.
2602080	2602661	I have to get excited.
2602881	2603401	Fuck you!
2603922	2604222	See?
2604242	2606684	Please.
2607444	2608945	Alright, um, Will!
2610006	2610467	Will!
2610507	2611067	How you doing?
2611507	2611928	Slinky.
2612508	2613929	Slinky wizard.
2614069	2616111	Are you still slinky wizard or just slinky now?
2617332	2617712	Whatever.
2620163	2620543	I don't know.
2620603	2622444	Such an apathetic little teen you are.
2622504	2622944	God.
2622984	2623804	I don't care anymore.
2623824	2624285	It doesn't matter.
2624325	2625025	Well, how was your week?
2625045	2625965	How was your day?
2627226	2628606	Well, high school.
2629186	2633208	So, yeah, high school is high school, and high school sucks.
2635449	2638810	And, you know, on Tuesday, I got my license, barely.
2639630	2640211	Missed 11.
2640551	2641891	Oh, yeah.
2642331	2643172	Hey, what score is that? 89?
2645952	2647653	I think the most you can miss is like 13 or 15.
2647693	2647753	Oh.
2648033	2649714	Yeah.
2650514	2652055	Wait, on the written test?
2652655	2654116	The driving test.
2654837	2655157	Really?
2655237	2658338	God, you used to be able to get a 70 and still pass, because I got an 80.
2658618	2661340	Yeah, they're evil.
2663221	2664661	I got a B- in driving.
2664801	2668903	Okay, I got like a 70, I got like the lowest you can get.
2669163	2669804	Here's what happened.
2670911	2694219	I got, uh, let's see how we did this, I got knocked off probably four points, so I probably would have had like a 90-something, and I finished the entire test, and I parked, and I parked like shit, I parked all crooked and stuff, and I didn't take any points off that, and we're right about to go inside and get my license, because I got like a 90-something percent, and he's like, actually, you didn't move your head enough, and then knocks off like 20 points, I was like,
2695177	2697718	Was he just mad because you weren't moving your head up and down his crotch?
2697738	2702060	I was moving my head like this, and this is only for the people in the studio because you guys, you know, over there can't hear it.
2702120	2703480	You can kind of see on the cam.
2703660	2711243	But I was moving my head like this because you have to look, you know, you have to look down a street when you drive through intersections and you look down both sides.
2711563	2712383	I was moving my head like this.
2712843	2713944	He wanted me to move my head like this.
2717017	2720018	Did you take it at Florin or something?
2720038	2720398	What's that?
2720418	2721658	Did you take it at Florin Mall?
2723079	2726200	No, I did this in Auburn, my hometown.
2726500	2729581	My little hick town, Auburn, where all the races are.
2729601	2730121	I don't know.
2730481	2732902	Anyway, so, yeah, but I barely passed.
2732942	2737083	And I've never been in an accident, except for somebody who ran in the back of me.
2738684	2739224	We all know.
2739884	2740544	I took mine.
2740744	2743565	I got a 70 the day after I got in a car accident.
2745065	2746706	The only car accident I've ever been in.
2749082	2749983	All right, enough tangents.
2750043	2751063	Let Will finish his story.
2751624	2753445	So anyways, hi, Angel.
2755306	2757508	See, she says, never mind.
2757788	2761130	I just would like to reiterate, those of you in the chat room, we can see you on the TV.
2761210	2764012	Everybody here can see you on the TV, loud and clear.
2764072	2769856	And Vandalist even has his laptop, and he's in the chat room, you know, talking smack about us when we're not looking at the TV.
2769976	2770376	I'm just kidding.
2771517	2775199	All right, so then, you know, just finish out school or whatever and...
2776440	2785586	Pretty much just been driving around all weekend and trying to cause trouble and stuff like that.
2786627	2787127	Fun stuff.
2789269	2789569	Alright.
2790589	2791130	That's about it.
2791330	2792030	Alright, cool deal.
2792090	2793531	Have you played A&DDR at all lately?
2795132	2795833	I know I haven't.
2797034	2797834	No, actually no.
2797874	2800876	We went on Thursday and I did play two games.
2801417	2802337	I'm working on my doubles.
2802577	2804919	For some reason I'm in this mood where I have to play doubles.
2806308	2807509	But enough about me, what about you?
2807549	2808931	Yeah, I went Saturday morning.
2809531	2809792	I know.
2810012	2815437	Just for the hell of it, and... Yeah, I haven't been in a while, so... I was sore.
2816018	2816498	Fun stuff.
2817299	2823285	Do you find that when you haven't played in a while, like when you start playing those katas back to back, you're like... Yeah.
2823305	2824326	Because that's me.
2824507	2824867	Smoker.
2825187	2825568	Smokers.
2825928	2827269	Well... Yeah.
2827349	2828370	Did you take up smoking?
2828411	2828591	No.
2828811	2829231	Oh, okay.
2829291	2829592	I just...
2830945	2833467	I see Terry sitting on the computer, so I'll go to Bradley.
2833507	2834587	If we can get a mic over to Bradley.
2834607	2835388	Can we get a mic over to Bradley?
2835408	2837549	Bradley, how was your week and how was your day?
2859448	2861390	Mostly blah, of course, as usual.
2862511	2864493	Monday, it was not much.
2865513	2869257	Tuesday, I called a temp agency and set up an appointment.
2870358	2872320	Wednesday, did more crap.
2874440	2875140	More crap.
2875460	2883302	Thursday I went to this temp agency, basically an accounting type temp agency, maybe find a data entry job or something of that sort.
2883823	2886403	And I did well enough on their Excel test.
2886523	2891905	They basically gave me the advanced accounting test instead of the basic one they were supposed to give me.
2892785	2897126	But I did well enough on that, even though I had studied accounting terms the day before.
2899023	2903646	It also gave me an Excel test, so he said, hey, you did well enough on this, why don't you go take the certification?
2904166	2905527	So I took that and passed that.
2906707	2911470	And so I'm certified now for the general, like the specialist.
2911990	2914472	And then Friday, didn't do much of anything.
2915332	2916773	Set up eBay auctions and such.
2917533	2920135	Then Saturday, I went and saw The Matrix in Davis.
2925979	2927259	and watch The Matrix.
2928300	2932121	And I was sort of just sitting there watching it.
2932581	2934421	I don't know if I was really paying attention to it.
2934441	2936682	I was just like, ooh, pretty things.
2937382	2938962	Like ships flying around.
2939702	2943603	The action scenes were good, but the dialogue scenes were kind of stupid.
2945064	2947864	So I sort of liked it and sort of didn't like it.
2949405	2951325	And then today, more crap.
2951885	2953006	And that's basically everything.
2956403	2956743	All right.
2959726	2962369	Then let's go over to Terry and see how your week was.
2962389	2963550	Let me start by answering this.
2963951	2967114	Hello, I am... My week has been very busy.
2967554	2969837	Hey, look, there's boobies on the webcam.
2970858	2971879	Boobies on cam!
2972379	2977544	And how that's possible when there's no women here tonight, I have no idea, but go ahead.
2977564	2978805	Brad, stop showing the boobies.
2980157	2981778	Okay, I've been very busy at work.
2982098	2988321	We're hiring for a new position in my team, and so I'm going to bore you guys on my work.
2988921	2995163	Bull crap, because that's what I'm dealing with, is hiring new people and being in a new organization and fun stuff like that.
2996384	2997705	But anyways, I watched...
2999710	3029245	Matrix Reloaded or Matrix Revolutions if you don't see my LJ which is vandalist.livejournal.com nice plug and that is we watched IMAX or Revolutions on IMAX ah how was that it was freaking unbelievable I bet I bet even a shit movie would be great on IMAX the Defense of Zion if you've seen this movie and you watch it on a regular show on a regular screen you go watch it on IMAX it just blows you away the Defense of Zion is unbelievable on that screen I bet
3030049	3039775	But anyways, the other kind of cool thing about going down there was we had one of my friend's roommates go with us, and he's a guy that'll do anything if you start giving him a little alcohol.
3040416	3040836	Oh, goody.
3041216	3044399	And so this guy is about 240 pounds, about 5'7".
3044419	3046960	He's got about the geekiest glasses you can find.
3048221	3051063	And they got him to take two triple shots of tequila.
3052240	3053881	and so his ears were pretty red.
3054081	3056743	Of course, he's over 21 and all that, you know, this is completely legal.
3056763	3058143	Of course, yes, completely legal.
3058523	3061665	And he proceeded to, they convinced him to take off his shirt.
3062225	3063586	This is, okay, this is Gordon Biersch.
3063686	3064066	Oh my.
3064086	3065747	You know where Gordon Biersch is on San Francisco?
3065787	3070670	It's right on the corner from Barcadero and Harrison, which is right by his peers.
3072150	3077033	And he took a box out of a trash can, he took off his shirt and proceeded to belly flop it for us.
3078600	3080262	There was a nice light rail going by.
3081182	3085666	It was about 3 o'clock in the afternoon in San Francisco on a Wednesday.
3088108	3092312	And so we needed webcams because we really wanted to capture this and put this on eBay.
3092332	3094754	He would have been the next Star Wars kid.
3095594	3097816	But we were unable to do that.
3098416	3102540	I'm sure someone will post a link to Star Wars Kid if someone starts asking questions.
3104221	3104662	Other than that...
3105868	3107889	My week has been just busy with work stuff and everything.
3108850	3111952	And family stuff and home stuff and boring stuff.
3112512	3116615	But I managed to make it here because I actually had... I'm a day shifter next week.
3116655	3117136	I work nights.
3118502	3119183	I work 11 p.m.
3119203	3119683	to 8 a.m.
3119723	3121184	if you can imagine that at the Vampire Shift.
3121445	3121645	Right.
3122566	3125048	My old roommate used to work at Vampire Shift, but it was at Walmart.
3125088	3126609	It wasn't a job nearly as cool as yours.
3127050	3130132	It was enjoyable, though.
3130152	3131173	I like working nights and everything.
3131193	3131534	It's nice.
3132014	3136598	But I've got to be on day shift all this week because I've got to hire somebody and do all that fun stuff.
3136879	3137379	I got you.
3137819	3138840	Anyways, that's about it.
3138960	3139221	Boring.
3139941	3141703	No, it's good to have you here.
3142398	3145659	I'm glad that they switched you to day shift so we could get a chance to have you here.
3145719	3149461	Even though you may not like day shift, I'm glad for our own selfish reasons we finally got you on the show.
3150021	3150461	Well, thank you.
3150501	3151181	I'm glad to be here.
3151382	3151682	It's fun.
3151702	3152002	All right.
3152082	3152322	Cool.
3153322	3157284	As far as my week and my day, nothing too exciting.
3157504	3161465	Thursday went out to Golf Land, and I've been working on my doubles game.
3162266	3169689	I noticed there was one high score list for one of the doubles that had no scores on it, so I thought I'd play just to get my name on it, so that was kind of funny.
3171309	3172330	My ego talking there.
3172870	3175291	And what else did I do this week?
3176092	3177412	Not really a whole heck of a lot.
3177512	3179373	Just been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XI.
3180013	3181254	Shane, if you're out there, hello.
3181374	3183175	He's my buddy out in Kansas.
3183215	3186176	We've been playing Final Fantasy XI non-stop through the thing.
3186557	3188658	And the nice thing is we've been using this program, TeamSpeak.
3189998	3191999	Vandalus, you're a big multiplayer game player.
3192039	3193400	You probably know about this one, right?
3193420	3199223	TeamSpeak, the one that allows you... It basically turns your computer into Xbox Live, where you can use the microphone to talk to people and stuff like that.
3199263	3199703	So it's cool.
3200887	3211833	I know I haven't really gone into too much detail about Final Fantasy XI yet, that's because I still, even after two weeks of playing the game, I still feel like I have not scratched the surface.
3211893	3215135	There's just so much more to discover in the game, and it's just so...
3215925	3216686	Just vast.
3216746	3217566	There's so much to it.
3218227	3220068	It's unlike any other Final Fantasy game.
3220289	3225853	I still say it's kind of odd that they chose to go with Final Fantasy XI as opposed to Final Fantasy Online.
3226353	3228135	But other than that, I mean, the game's terrific.
3228195	3230336	It's just not what a lot of you are going to expect.
3230637	3232338	That's all.
3234380	3236461	So that was pretty much my week and my day.
3236521	3238343	I didn't get to go see any cool movies or anything.
3239333	3241735	Last night hung out with the out-of-town buddy who was here.
3241815	3248278	Played a lot of Karaoke Revolution and iToy, the new webcam tool for the PS2, is out.
3248539	3249799	And we've been playing iToy a lot.
3249879	3255463	And those of you that sit in our chat room during the week saw a random webcam was up on, I think, Thursday night.
3255803	3257184	We were playing iToy and all that stuff.
3257204	3259405	So now they have a webcam for PS2?
3259425	3261506	They have a webcam for PS2 with games and everything.
3261666	3262227	That is really sweet.
3262267	3264048	Maybe towards the end of the show we'll hook it up or something.
3264248	3265429	OMG hi hi to you.
3266489	3268089	All of a sudden, it's taking a whole new level.
3268149	3271290	It's going to 8-year-olds on PS2s now.
3271430	3276932	Seriously, they have this thing where you can do the video messaging on it, but it doesn't make sense because you save it on your memory card.
3277372	3280512	Now, I'm hearing that you can use your broadband to do it, but I didn't see an option for it.
3281673	3290955	What would end up happening is you save it as a file, and then you upload it as an attachment to your email through broadband.
3292489	3292989	Get what I'm saying?
3293389	3293750	Wow.
3293930	3298472	So then you would download it to your memory card using whatever software they have for the PS2.
3298652	3299572	I don't really know.
3300533	3304554	And then that way you can say, hey, fuck you, and then that would be an attachment.
3305115	3314319	Can you imagine the social hacking you can do with that by convincing these kids, hey, turn on your camera and click on this really cool link?
3315059	3318881	And all of a sudden you can get all kinds of really fun voyeur stuff going on in the house.
3321260	3327125	Let's go out to the street and find a couple of whores and make the first eye toy porn.
3340174	3343595	No, or like, you remember how they have the little rainbow feature and stuff?
3343615	3346436	The guy does the cum shot and it's all rainbow-y behind it.
3347196	3348637	How about iToy Fight Club?
3348817	3353318	Now, see, somebody's telling me that the longest you can do a video on iToy is one minute.
3353678	3354158	You know what?
3354578	3356659	One minute's long enough for some guys.
3356719	3357499	That's a money shot.
3361221	3362501	We not only invent...
3363248	3365209	A new form of, you know, internet porn.
3365610	3368272	We can invent a whole new porn genre.
3368552	3369733	The one minute porn.
3370633	3375877	Film it in segments, just like, you know, like 24, you know, where it's like five second segments or whatever.
3376097	3376978	We really need Brad.
3377878	3378399	And he's not here.
3378919	3380860	To be able to provide some commentary to this.
3381240	3381661	That's alright.
3382942	3384923	Um, he'll, we can, we can ask him later.
3385103	3385624	If we remember.
3386004	3387445	Angel's got a good comparison though.
3387485	3391668	She says, EyeToy reminds her of when, remember the old game show Nick Arcade?
3393488	3397691	They would go inside the game and they'd have to do some kind of stupid thing inside the game.
3397971	3399932	She says the eye toy totally reminds her of that.
3400032	3401753	And I think she's right on the money.
3401833	3403394	I think that's a damn good comparison.
3403774	3406355	The eye toy is like the last level of Nick Arcade.
3406495	3407356	Wouldn't you say so, Loki?
3409177	3416601	Well, if by making that comparison, if you're saying it looks like bumbling idiots playing the game, yes.
3416941	3419262	That would be a perfect comparison.
3420743	3421063	All right.
3422938	3425501	Okay, so I think what we're going to do now is we're going to go ahead and take a break.
3425521	3428263	We're going to do some more Poppin' Music Part 10 music.
3428303	3432247	And when we come back, we're going to talk about karaoke revolutions all the rage this week.
3432267	3433568	We're going to give our thoughts on that.
3434149	3435971	And Cage Match, too, when we come back.
3436846	3443770	Alright, in this break, from the Poppin' 10 music soundtrack, you're going to hear the new Revenge song.
3443810	3448853	Yes, Naoki's little pseudonym, Revenge, has a new song on the Poppin' Music 10 soundtrack.
3449174	3452716	It's called Erebatia, and it's an Arab song.
3453596	3454897	Erebatia, or something like that.
3455017	3455858	And then we're going to hear...
3457188	3464013	We're going to hear something called Como Tomac by a group called Artemis, and it's in the genre of lonely.
3464373	3471579	And then we're going to hear something in the genre of symphonic metal, and the song is called Holy Forest, and the artist is... Holy Forest!
3471719	3472820	Holy Forest, Batman!
3473120	3474741	And the artist is Sarastro.
3474761	3478384	So we're going to start it off with Revenge here on Poppin' Music 10 Break.
3478404	3479585	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
3479665	3480085	We'll be back.
3554141	3555113	Thanks for watching!
3602662	3609727	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3675015	3676219	Thank you for watching!
3710114	3711215	Thank you for watching!
3745499	3746341	Thanks for watching!
3764136	3770869	The legend, keep your face, to stand with the evil back into the night, that will change you all.
3819962	3825804	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
3827225	3829305	Hello and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
3836115	3840658	Some more music in that break from the Poppin' Music 10 soundtrack.
3841459	3844081	What did you guys think of some of those songs here?
3844121	3846342	Let's start off with the Revenge track.
3846422	3847683	It was Arabatia.
3847703	3848584	What did you guys think of that one?
3850305	3850945	It was interesting.
3850985	3853027	It sounds just like a exotic ethnic song.
3853207	3854968	Fucking Max Unlimited samples.
3855629	3858651	Seriously, they need to get away from Max Unlimited.
3859371	3859892	Yeah, I agree.
3859912	3861613	Stop remaking the song.
3861753	3862994	Let the Max die.
3863094	3864295	Step away from the Max.
3866929	3867810	Yeah, good stuff.
3868070	3871032	It's exotic ethnic, which is already good, so, good stuff.
3871993	3874475	Whatever, if they want to use samples from other songs, it's fine with me.
3874535	3878898	I mean, all these popular European and American DJs constantly use samples.
3878938	3880179	Yeah, but they use good samples.
3880719	3882241	That's such a bad sample.
3882301	3885363	That sample right there makes me really pissed off at the song.
3886144	3886684	It does!
3887204	3893049	Just like the ending of Matrix Revolutions, how they fucked up that song and made fun of the Hindus and stuff.
3893089	3894110	It makes me hate the movie.
3894130	3894310	God.
3894730	3897092	God, some people.
3897733	3898573	I haven't even seen the movie.
3898593	3913286	What bothered me, what kind of irks me about Arbatia, it's a decent song, it's kind of fun, it's one of the better songs in the soundtrack, but I still picture Revenge as always doing these DDR songs and stuff, and there's no kind of backbeat to it, so I can't imagine myself dancing to it.
3913606	3915688	And for some reason, that makes me not like it as much.
3915708	3916668	Listen to the bag.
3917592	3917973	and DarkSakura.
3934198	3934758	That's fine.
3934818	3943484	I mean, Revenge has always been Naoki's, you know, trying to attempt to do, like, ethnic-sounding music, and that's fine if it doesn't have a beat.
3943824	3945585	That's why it's in poppin' music and not DDR.
3946706	3947026	Whatever.
3947246	3947527	Alright.
3948267	3954031	Okay, the next song was from a group called Komo Tomak, and that's the genre of Lonely, and it's Artemis.
3954431	3959374	And there's actually a long version of this on the Poppin' Music 10 soundtrack.
3959434	3960195	Any thoughts on that?
3960815	3961436	Uh, where's Luna?
3962464	3964094	and Sailor Moon and Sailor Mercury.
3967674	3968054	Okay.
3968074	3970676	Yeah, it does kind of sound like that anime theme.
3970856	3971836	No, no, Artemis.
3972237	3973137	You need to watch Sailor Moon.
3973917	3974458	I don't watch.
3974598	3978880	Artemis is... Yes, you do have to watch Sailor Moon.
3978920	3987105	I got the live-action Sailor Moon episodes that are just newly showing in Japan, and it's some of the greatest, like, stupid, silly stuff.
3987225	3988205	That I will watch.
3988405	3989406	Send it on over.
3989466	3991867	We showed the first episode to Eddie, and he was crying.
3991907	3992567	It was so funny.
3992688	3993608	I want to see it.
3993948	3995329	It's just, it's so cheesy.
3995389	3997170	It's, as he says, ill-conceived.
3997330	3999151	It can't be better than Strangers with Candy, though.
3999431	4002091	Oh, well, no, it's not trying to be funny.
4002731	4003972	It's funny because it's stupid.
4004052	4009193	I thought you were telling me that the people that translated it or did the fan sub or whatever, that they tried to make it funny.
4009253	4009973	They skimped.
4010353	4010894	They skimped.
4011434	4012294	They did some parody.
4012314	4015475	Okay, they left in some commercials that are showing on the...
4016744	4018986	I'll Always Be Watching You Especially When You're In The Bathroom
4048426	4066563	And then there's this other one where it's these girls in panties, little girls wearing diapers, and it's a diaper commercial or something, and it says, Pantsu Faito, Pantsu Faito, and at the end it goes, Buy these panties, guaranteed pre-worn by a pedalicious girl, just like this one.
4067797	4089819	It's so great, or the Sailor Moon, like, the memorabilia they sell, like these wands and stuff, oh yeah, but they sell the memorabilia, and it's like, what does he say, buy our Sailor Moon toys so you can transform, just like Sailor Moon, and then at the end it goes, successful transformation, not guaranteed.
4093746	4100229	or the Hello Kitty one where it's like, Hello Kitty, Hello Kitty, or it's like, I don't know, something Nico, you know, Hello Kitty, Hello Kitty.
4100509	4109174	At the bottom it says, Evil Kitty, Evil Kitty, Evil Kitty, and then it's like, buy Evil Kitty mind control candy so we can control your kids and stuff like that.
4109254	4110235	It's great.
4111776	4112036	Right.
4112676	4117579	The last song we heard in that break was Sastro with Holy Forest.
4122342	4124103	What did you think of that?
4143149	4145410	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4162020	4162801	DJ Taka, Attack
4192340	4195281	I mean, why put... whatever, I don't know.
4195822	4196982	Konami's kind of losing their mind.
4198063	4198543	So, whatever.
4200143	4200424	Okay.
4201524	4204965	Alright, so that was the Music in a Poppin' Tin soundtrack.
4205266	4208627	We'll do some more later, but first, this is all the rage this week.
4209247	4213489	Out now, just came out this week, a brand new Bomani game.
4213509	4213969	Yay!
4214009	4220372	Something brand new, and it's not in the arcades, it's only for the home, and America Shock got it first.
4221112	4221973	Karaoke Revolution, out this week.
4240623	4242324	What are your guys' impressions of Karaoke Revolution?
4242404	4244964	First, does somebody want to try and describe the game?
4244984	4248525	Because I know not even all of us here have played it yet, but does somebody want to try and describe the game?
4248906	4249566	Like how it plays?
4249626	4250306	Yeah, how it plays.
4250326	4252527	Because I think a lot of people still haven't gotten how it works yet.
4252567	4253467	You want to try and explain it, Brad?
4253787	4254127	Because I can't.
4254147	4255487	First, you go to the store and you shell out $70.
4255908	4257028	Okay, after that.
4257208	4257488	Okay.
4257848	4260069	Then you bring it home and you look at it, you oogle it.
4260129	4260469	After that.
4261349	4266171	You get a microphone headset combination like what Britney Spears and Madonna uses.
4266652	4269133	You put this thing on, and you go into it, okay?
4269313	4274255	Now, it's got like a... You pick levels.
4274876	4278297	You pick a song, and you pick a level, and it's got like a crowd of people.
4278337	4279498	There's like a band behind you.
4279538	4282859	There's a character you pick who dances, and they're overdeveloped in the head.
4284060	4287902	And they sing, and at the bottom is like...
4288942	4293945	You know, if anybody's ever seen karaoke, words go by, or usually words are there and then they light up.
4294545	4296786	Yeah, the words, like this whole screen full of words.
4296886	4307892	Yeah, except with this, at the very bottom, there's like a rectangular section, takes up probably a third of the screen or a quarter of the screen at the bottom, that has the words that go from right to left.
4307932	4309193	They scroll across the screen.
4310730	4312533	It's like watching the news on CNN.
4312613	4313816	Exactly, like a ticker.
4314477	4319646	And on the left is a line similar to any Beatmania or DDR.
4319666	4322010	It's a judgment line where you have to start here.
4323232	4328456	And then from the top to the bottom where the words are, are lines of how long you're supposed to hold a note.
4328797	4334622	And they go up and down depending on if the note should be high or low or whatnot.
4334722	4339667	And if some of the notes, and I'm not going to sing, but they'll go like, mmm, they'll rise.
4340868	4343390	You'll see the little line go up or down.
4343470	4345052	So you kind of have to follow the...
4346753	4349196	The tone of it, you know, it just judges on the tone of it.
4349276	4355583	So you can pretty much make up any word you want or go, la la la la, or like I did for It's the End of the World.
4355643	4360329	Instead of doing the rap thing that he does, I go, da da da da da da da da da da da da da.
4362370	4362730	and so on.
4384215	4388257	I never thought I would hear you sing, but this game finally got it.
4408406	4413313	If that's on and that person is singing really high, you can drop your octave and it's still great.
4414054	4417738	It's got a pretty sophisticated tone recognition system in it.
4417779	4418339	It's really good.
4420051	4421552	Like a virgin Like a virgin is sung
4439443	4440144	Thank you for watching!
4459881	4461641	I have to agree, this is a great game.
4461681	4466062	I was really skeptical about it at first, but it's fucking great.
4466142	4467062	It's a great idea.
4467642	4471023	My only kind of... I have a couple concerns with it, though.
4471163	4477744	I mean, it's a great game, great party game, but as a solo game, it's not something I could see myself kind of motivating myself to do solo.
4477844	4485146	Although, it will... Whereas DDR will not make you a better dancer, Karaoke Revolution will make you a better singer.
4485166	4485506	Maybe.
4485626	4486206	I don't know yet.
4486266	4486546	If you're...
4487743	4488264	It'll help.
4488904	4494609	It helps show you if you're on key or not, A. B, it helps you to kind of hold your pitch and maintain your pitch.
4494909	4496070	That's the biggest thing about it.
4496611	4501315	Really, the way you get better at singing is by singing more and more.
4501735	4504837	So, Karaoke Revolution will help you be a better singer.
4505278	4510262	It won't turn you into an all-star, but it'll help you go from, you know, not so great, but to decent.
4510482	4516825	Well, see, on the songs that it's got on there, it'll point out to you that, hey, you're not supposed to, you know, sing the song this certain way.
4516905	4519266	It actually shows you the way the song's supposed to be sung.
4519706	4528109	For most parts, I noticed that in some of the songs, it looks like they programmed the lines in, the grading in, like, maybe a little different than the original singer sang it.
4528449	4529990	Because I got kind of confused on some of the songs.
4530010	4537253	I was like, wait a minute, the line is going up, or it stays straight when the singer's, like, actually raising their pitch or lowering it and whatnot, so...
4537893	4554767	I don't know, but altogether, the biggest thing I don't like about it is that it's coded, the lines that go by, you know, that you're supposed to sing it, are coded in only one way, so you can only sing the song in one way as far as, you know, your tone.
4554807	4558671	You can't improvise, you can improvise words, but you can't improvise...
4559111	4560392	Unless you play non-judge mode.
4560412	4562093	There is a free mode that you're not judged.
4562273	4564834	And you say you're not judged, so it's almost like not even really worth playing it.
4564854	4566735	It's like, might as well just sing along to any song.
4566775	4567055	Right.
4568376	4573579	I wish that they had kind of like an edit mode where you can edit the lines in any way you wanted to.
4574099	4578361	Like, say you sing it without lines, and it would record those lines as you're singing it.
4578401	4579122	Like an edit mode?
4579142	4580282	Like an edit mode for steps.
4580322	4581083	Oh, that's kind of weird.
4581143	4581443	Okay.
4582103	4585827	A real time edit where you're singing and it records the lines so you can play them back later.
4585867	4587349	So you can improvise a song.
4587549	4590692	Because you know a lot of people who go up and do karaoke, they'll improvise a song.
4590792	4591713	I do, yeah.
4591873	4595577	To kind of play it up a little more and get people a little more excited.
4596274	4596534	and many more.
4618635	4627485	I think it's an advertisement for the Matrix though, because most of the people in the crowd are all like agents.
4627525	4629728	They all look exactly the same, wearing the same things.
4629748	4629968	Yes.
4631270	4633673	Or the best, when you suck, they start walking away.
4633693	4633773	Yeah.
4635373	4638937	And then if you totally fail the song, your person breaks down and cries on the stage.
4638957	4639898	They fall to the ground.
4640539	4641139	It was great.
4641179	4641860	You hate me.
4642340	4643061	You don't love me.
4643382	4645744	What do you think of the song list?
4645784	4648127	I've heard some complaints, and this is kind of one of my chief complaints.
4648187	4650069	It's kind of not enough songs, but...
4651471	4654612	All things considered, they only license 35 songs or whatever.
4654672	4656593	There are 35 pretty solid songs.
4656613	4659654	They have a pretty damn good mix of music in it, I think.
4659874	4664115	I think there's at least one, two songs that everybody's going to dig.
4665016	4669417	Like when we fired it up and Broken Wings was in it, Loki was like, oh my god, cool.
4669497	4670197	Yeah, exactly.
4670558	4671258	There are some...
4671958	4674820	There are some great classics in this.
4676181	4683526	I mean, some of the best classic 80s music and some of the better pop music, because I'm not a big fan of pop, you know.
4683987	4686689	I'm a mild fan of top 40 pop.
4686709	4688890	There's a lot of it I don't like, but there's a lot of it I do like.
4688910	4693614	And I was really happy to see that there were a couple of Michelle Branch songs in there, because I dig her and stuff.
4693654	4699258	They have some good... Yeah, actually, I think they did a very good job in the song selection, except for...
4700018	4706121	And I understand the reason why they did this, I think, if it's the same reason I'm thinking, putting in songs like Son of a Preacher or whatever.
4706741	4707681	You know, or whatever it's called.
4707701	4716165	You are still mad that you got the Chain of Fools song on random last night.
4716225	4718245	You are still mad you had to sing that last night.
4718526	4721727	Like, they put some really stupid songs in there, but that's just my opinion.
4721767	4723628	I know there are people out there that love these songs.
4723708	4724648	It's not classics.
4725068	4727389	Aretha, come on, Aretha is classic.
4727529	4729150	Yeah, I understand the purpose, it's just like...
4729750	4729990	What?
4730010	4731572	I don't want to sing to the fools.
4731592	4734876	There's going to be just as many songs that you hate as there are going to be that you love.
4734896	4737339	There's less songs that I hate than there are songs that I like.
4738220	4741083	And like Bizarre Love Triangle, it was like, oh my god.
4741183	4744347	Yeah, some of the great 80s songs like Bizarre Love Triangle, um...
4745438	4746139	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4764696	4768120	I hope there's some really good stuff on the expansion.
4768160	4768801	If it's anything like...
4781377	4784179	What they released on the core mix that they just released.
4784299	4786641	And then we got some good music coming out.
4786701	4790324	Well, what would be nice is, you know, it really depends, I think, on how this game takes off.
4790344	4801393	Like, if it's really popular, if it goes DDR style, then I think we're going to see a lot of... I think we'll see really specialized discs where it's going to be like women hits of the 90s type thing, expansion discs, then male hits of the 90s type thing.
4801433	4804475	It's all dependent on how they advertise this thing.
4804515	4808178	And Konami in America has not been known for the best advertising campaigns.
4808838	4809099	So it's...
4812331	4813733	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4825368	4825708	and so on.
4844773	4845894	and so on.
4872233	4896650	I hope that the Japanese versions are worthy of bringing over Oh, not bringing over here, but for me to import Because there's a lot of J-rock and J-pop songs that I really, really like That I would love to get to play in Karaoke Revolution I hope some Larkin Seal stuff shows up In Japan, they are doing Karaoke Revolution in Japan, too And if you go to the official Karaoke Revolution website for Japan...
4897590	4917822	6 expansion discs already out 6 expansion discs are coming out this month I think later this month 6 discs and we're talking and they kind of do the genre thing a little bit because there's one that's specifically for ballads and there's a couple J-pop hits and things like that and there are groups Morning Musume Ayumi of course Ayumi's on there of course what were some of the other bands um
4920644	4927589	I can't wait to sing Chocoto Love with Petit Love I don't think Chocoto Love was on there Really?
4927609	4935533	No, I would have recognized it I may have missed it Or the original Freckles, Suboxone, however you pronounce it Alright, Terry, comment?
4940201	4941902	My parents have something that's kind of like this.
4941962	4946986	It's this stand-alone DVD karaoke-based thing that does the same kind of thing.
4947046	4950569	It measures the tone and the timing that you do.
4951170	4956794	It's got nine DVDs of Korean, Japanese, Filipino, Chinese, and American music.
4956974	4957755	Oh, my gosh.
4957975	4959937	And the DVDs are swappable.
4960417	4961338	This thing was about $400, and it's...
4962899	4967423	Totally awesome, because every time we go down there, I mean, we spend the first day just doing this thing.
4967643	4974189	I'm doing gangsters, and it's great because it shows the backgrounds have absolutely nothing to do with the show.
4975070	4984397	And the song, you know, they had Gangster's Paradise, and the background is showing this peaceful little farm, almost like it should be Amish Paradise, and it's just great.
4985598	4988041	That reminds me of when we went to, was it CyberZone?
4988789	4989409	DarkSakura.com
5009901	5011042	and we had the big fanfare and everything.
5011062	5013804	That's the thing is, I noticed you guys suck and you still got high grades.
5013824	5014264	Shut up!
5014385	5016967	Um, anyway, well, I mean, I read and stuff.
5016987	5020569	Oh my god, you don't even want to know how much time I spent in that stupid karaoke room at the tournament.
5020589	5021590	No, I was there, man.
5021610	5022931	You were in there all the time with her.
5022971	5024032	I was like, man, we gotta get out of there.
5024112	5024593	It was so much fun.
5024793	5026034	We had a blast.
5026074	5027815	We were laughing our ass off in there.
5028175	5037723	Like, the great thing is, like, just like Terry says, like, you'll be singing a song and the background is like this nice landscape of Alaska with this, like, these deers and elk and mooses and shit.
5037803	5037903	Like,
5038804	5042390	Yeah, exactly, to like a Gangster's Paradise or some weird Britney Spears song.
5042410	5043813	It's like, what the hell?
5043833	5045636	This video has nothing to do with anything.
5046963	5048604	Yeah, it's to throw you off, totally.
5049225	5062514	Yeah, that's the thing though, is that this game, if you've played, I don't know about the one that Terry's talking about, but I would assume it's kind of like the one that we saw at CyberZone, where it grades you, but this thing is like a really, really accurate grading system, this karaoke revolution.
5062574	5065777	I was so surprised at how much work they put into it.
5066117	5068699	Why don't they put some more work into DDR, like they did this?
5070221	5071223	Some other comments in the chat.
5071243	5073006	I want to address some comments that came up in the chat room.
5073266	5073667	One comment.
5073747	5076291	Why don't you buy Karaoke Revolution for the Japanese PS2?
5077013	5082121	Not likely to happen unless they release some kind of American songs expansion pack because...
5083291	5084691	I can't sing in Japanese.
5085472	5086812	And I'm not going to just fake it.
5086892	5088292	I mean, I don't know any of the songs.
5088372	5091793	I don't listen to J music as much as Brad does.
5091853	5096134	Maybe he would like it, but I just wouldn't know the songs well enough to necessitate buying it.
5096475	5100996	I think this is one of those rare cases where the American version has something for me and the Japanese doesn't.
5101116	5109178	Yeah, it's just for those people like, I don't know, like me, I don't understand Japanese, but from listening to a lot of Japanese music and like...
5111099	5112849	Ayuma Hamasaki, Larkin Seal
5114934	5118557	Tons of just Japanese pop and rock artists and stuff.
5119417	5121959	I can pick up a lot of these words and I start to know the lyrics.
5122019	5126182	And I can actually look at the lyrics and I can sing the lyrics in Japanese.
5126242	5127523	I have no fucking idea what they're talking about.
5127543	5131406	They could be saying, you stupid hunky bitches from America, stop buying our shit.
5131627	5133348	Or, you know, doing this stuff.
5133388	5140533	But for me, or for anybody like me who's that into it, yeah, you could go ahead and import the Japanese versions.
5140634	5141094	I might.
5141654	5141914	and so on.
5166521	5173904	I have seen, because they do let you bring in your own music, and I saw somebody once, they brought in, it was some kind of, like it was an Indian song.
5175144	5179126	One of those, it sounded like it was straight out of a Bollywood picture type thing.
5179426	5181107	And he was doing the dance and everything.
5181127	5181847	It was great.
5182087	5183468	I mean, I was entertained by it.
5183508	5185509	I didn't know what the hell he was saying, but it was totally entertaining.
5185789	5188450	Yeah, well, you get your freaks in there every once in a while.
5188750	5189891	I wouldn't say he was a freak.
5189951	5190171	He was...
5191314	5194836	Keyboard, something interesting, confusing language.
5194856	5195456	You're an ass.
5195797	5196397	You're an ass.
5202400	5203101	Seriously.
5204101	5205222	Okay, what were some other...
5209027	5235863	Mel B has a cameo in Karaoke Revolution and it's actually in a video that you unlock we haven't gotten it ourselves yet but apparently you can unlock the song one week when you beat solo mode and you get a video with it too in the video section and apparently Mel B is in there singing a little bit of one week it's a clip of all these people singing one week and apparently he's in it
5236323	5238904	So, of course, you know we're going to unlock that shit this week.
5238924	5239484	Do it now.
5239564	5241704	And we will play it on the show for you next week.
5241784	5243485	And maybe we can get Loki to remix it.
5244725	5245325	Sorry, guys.
5245385	5246905	We're cutting off the show now.
5246945	5248486	We have to go unlock Mel B's video.
5248566	5254407	No, I... Well, I kind of just... I want to wait until the next time he's actually here on the show, which might not be... Hopefully in the next couple weeks.
5254427	5255467	Maybe we'll unlock it now.
5256148	5261489	Well, I'm... Well, you know, I'm going to unlock it now so I can see it, but I want to get him here and then play it over and over and say, Hey, Mel!
5263669	5265810	and play the sound and then embarrass the shit out of them.
5265830	5267711	Is there going to be a beatbox to it or something?
5267931	5268371	I don't know.
5268551	5269531	I don't know what it is yet.
5269591	5270291	We will see soon.
5270591	5277793	But I hear it's really cute that they even have a dog wearing the headset at one point that barks.
5278214	5282975	Which is what the original song kind of sounds like to me.
5283675	5285236	Any other thoughts on Karaoke Revolution?
5287176	5289637	Thank God they don't have that stupid song All Star in there.
5291186	5292127	That's all I gotta say.
5292267	5293748	Hey, now, you're an all-star.
5293768	5294148	That one?
5294749	5295069	Yes.
5295109	5297031	Why such a hatred on that specific song?
5297211	5303335	Because they use it in, like, every single fucking movie trailer and shit for, like, all these lame-ass movies.
5303375	5305577	You know, you have Mystery Man and Shrek.
5306778	5309400	I like the movie, too, but the trailer song was lame.
5309440	5309941	Garbage.
5309961	5316266	Okay, and Shrek 2, which I just saw before Elf, it also had that...
5317136	5318037	Yes, Shrek 2.
5318537	5320920	Also had the goddamn song on it, too.
5321540	5323041	It's like, ugh.
5325364	5325824	Hey, Loki.
5325844	5326124	Shrek 2?
5326665	5326925	Why?
5326965	5327305	Hey, now.
5327505	5328266	You're an all-star.
5328446	5330388	Get your... I'm gonna punch you.
5330408	5332930	I don't like that song, either.
5332990	5333831	I don't... What is that?
5333891	5334432	I hate it, too.
5334452	5335373	Is that Smash Mouth?
5336814	5337655	Fuck Smash Mouth.
5338453	5338833	No thanks.
5339414	5342616	They're doing all these commercials now because they can't make any more music.
5342676	5345698	They're constantly doing educational commercials and shit.
5345718	5346319	It's so stupid.
5348580	5350501	Any more thoughts on Karaoke Revolution, Brad?
5351522	5352783	Being one of the only other ones that's played it.
5352823	5354945	The other ones, I can tell we're boring everyone else here.
5354965	5356606	They're like, eh, haven't played it.
5356666	5357646	Go out and buy it.
5358247	5359428	Please, everybody.
5359968	5364771	Because we want Konami to get more money off of this so that they can go ahead and make more stuff like this in America.
5364791	5365212	Mm-hmm.
5366365	5374471	Then again, maybe if we tell them to not buy it and it does bad, maybe they'll put more of their time and money into games like Castlevania instead of... And DDR.
5375011	5378393	No, I could give a fuck about DDR as long as I'm getting my Castlevania on.
5379574	5379914	Alright.
5380835	5383637	I think now we're going to get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.
5383677	5384858	How does that sound to you guys?
5384978	5385858	Are you ready to rock?
5385878	5388740	Let's get ready to rock!
5390268	5396357	Alright, last week in the Orange Lounge Cage match, Jamie's song won, which is good news for her, because she didn't have to pick something while she's on vacation.
5397018	5402026	Even though she's not here, though, her song still gets to go for its third win in a row if it wins tonight.
5402607	5405671	And it wouldn't be any surprise, because it's a pretty darn good song.
5406736	5411978	It's a group called CyberX, and it features somebody named Rupina, and it's called Little Flower.
5412478	5421080	The way the cage match works is that we're going to play three songs for you guys, and you vote for your favorite, and that song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music and More program.
5422181	5429063	But you have to be in our chat room to play along, so head over to www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on chat.
5429543	5431344	Whole shitload of people in our chat room tonight.
5431404	5433744	It's more crowded than I've seen it in a while.
5434064	5434905	A whole shitload.
5434925	5435665	More than a buttload.
5435905	5437606	That's more than a buttload, it's a shitload.
5438426	5439626	So, um... Whoa, whoa, whoa.
5440566	5440927	Hold on.
5441127	5442767	I vote for Holly.
5442787	5443907	No, you can't vote for Holly.
5444188	5444768	Alright, here we go.
5444788	5445868	Here's a clip.
5445988	5448049	Because it won last week, you only get a clip of it.
5448529	5451350	It's CyberX featuring Rupino with Little Flower.
5451510	5451950	Enjoy.
5452890	5455371	That's the first song you can vote for tonight.
5480706	5481927	Thank you for watching!
5571130	5572312	Thank you for watching.
5572332	5573354	See you next time.
5645538	5647861	Alright, that was about half of last week's winner.
5647921	5650024	CyberX featuring Rapinoe with Little Flower.
5650064	5651265	Two weeks in a row winning.
5651325	5652747	Will it win tonight again?
5653688	5654670	Everybody says no.
5654730	5655871	Gosh, you guys are mean.
5656472	5659216	If it's been winning twice or whatever, then it should be ticked off.
5659316	5661518	Well, you're not allowed to give your opinion.
5661538	5662920	You had to give your opinion two weeks ago.
5662940	5663301	No, this is back.
5664515	5664895	I'm sorry.
5665075	5667977	Will it be my pick that knocks it off tonight?
5668037	5670499	My pick, probably not, but we can try it anyway.
5670919	5673981	My pick is, they're actually a Bomani artist now.
5674242	5677784	They had a song in DDR Max, USA.
5678585	5679485	You remember the song.
5679685	5680166	It was huge.
5680186	5680806	A lot of you liked it.
5680846	5681647	It was Sandstorm.
5682788	5685810	And Darude has a new song out now that is my pick for tonight's cave match.
5685850	5686671	It's called Music.
5687091	5692495	And it's not like, hey, Mr. DJ kind of music, but it's... Or I got a music, don't stop...
5694239	5696502	I don't think there's, there isn't, Darude's not in Ultramix.
5699545	5699786	No.
5700627	5701308	Well, whatever.
5702249	5703830	I don't care if it's going to be in DDR in the future.
5706213	5707755	I think it would be good for DDR, though.
5707775	5710298	But anyway, here's my pick for tonight's cage match.
5710338	5712020	It's Darude with music.
5712160	5712400	Enjoy.
5734975	5735735	Thanks for watching!
5805546	5808814	I've got superpowers, don't you think?
5840483	5841164	Thanks for watching!
5924384	5927026	Alright, that was song number two in tonight's KH match.
5927606	5929027	Garud with music.
5929187	5930668	Let's go around and see what folks thought of that.
5930688	5931649	We'll start with Brad.
5938933	5939414	Pretty good.
5940474	5945958	I don't think I'm a huge fan of Garud because they're kind of cookie cutter trance for me.
5946653	5947613	So, but it's still good.
5947713	5951835	I would have to vote for that if I can only vote for the last song or this song.
5952895	5953156	Alright.
5954696	5955536	And scale 1 to 10?
5956077	5956737	Scale 1 to 10?
5957297	5957717	I'll give it a 7.
5957817	5958698	Alright.
5959158	5959438	Will!
5962139	5962799	It's alright.
5963179	5967201	It sounded kind of rude-ish.
5967721	5974384	Pretty, yeah, like Brad said, kind of... Didn't you send this to me a long time ago?
5974404	5974664	Yeah, I did.
5975819	5976759	You must be sick of it now.
5976819	5979180	It's not bad, though.
5979200	5980920	I'd say it's a seven.
5981520	5981840	Alright.
5983061	5983421	Loki!
5985441	5989582	It was like the same four bars or something, just repeated throughout the whole song.
5989942	5995644	I mean, I've heard very repetitive trance before, but I mean, that's pretty bad.
5996044	5999065	I mean, even Sandstorm wasn't as repetitive as that.
5999105	6000305	Now I disagree with that.
6002213	6002653	But okay.
6002673	6005074	Strangely enough, I like Sandstorm better than that song.
6005455	6007095	Maybe it's just because it's got good memories for me.
6007536	6012998	When we had a very good radio station in the Sacramento area that got taken up by crazy freaking Christian people.
6013418	6014359	I'm sorry, is your name Loki?
6015279	6016740	Sorry.
6017540	6025344	Yeah, I remember when we used to do, like, the secret word of the day and stuff, and we used to, like, be falling down laughing because we'd be making fun of ravers.
6025644	6027385	Yeah, I remember when Orange Lounge Radio was funny.
6031457	6033098	Okay, I give it a six.
6033578	6033878	All right.
6034919	6036699	Terry, Mr. Vandalus.
6038380	6042562	I thought it was very trancy and very repetitive, as trancy songs can be.
6043963	6045003	And I'd give that one a seven.
6045743	6046004	All right.
6046024	6047104	I definitely liked it better than the first one.
6048645	6051586	Bradley, your thoughts on Darude Music?
6052727	6055268	Pretty much the same as everyone else, kind of thing.
6056088	6060090	Sort of there and repetitive, but not too bad, so a seven.
6061218	6069800	I give it an 8, because no song named Music is allowed to be a 10 unless it's Madonna.
6070520	6079102	Now who's Madonna remixed by Oakenfold, because I know they have one of Music.
6080522	6082722	Oakenfold does some great Madonna mixes.
6082742	6085123	Oakenfold can take anything and make it good.
6085819	6088601	Goddammit, I almost picked the Oakenfolds song for tonight's cage match.
6088621	6089021	I should have.
6089181	6091022	What if he did a remix of Goonies Are Good Enough?
6091042	6091603	Would you like that?
6091863	6092603	It would probably be good.
6092623	6092983	I would come.
6093003	6093424	Seriously.
6095865	6096185	Alright.
6098927	6101008	TMI, there is no TMI on this show, okay?
6101428	6102549	We live in TMI, Bill.
6103990	6104270	Alright.
6106091	6108393	The third song in tonight's cage match comes to us from Loki.
6109218	6110599	Loki, want to introduce this shit?
6110779	6117425	Yeah, literally, it comes to us from me because I made it last night, or this morning, however you want to look at it.
6118486	6131137	This was per request from the chatroom, they wanted me to remix this song from Kill Bill, which is Battle Without Honor or Cause or something like that, I can't remember the name.
6131177	6132778	Battle Without a Honor or Humanity.
6133895	6137457	Battle Without Honor or Humanity The 88 Severed Limbs Mix
6327492	6330213	Okay, there it is, a brand new Loki remix for you guys.
6330273	6332914	By the way, one of two remixes he's going to debut tonight.
6333175	6338777	So there's actually another remix coming later, but Loki thinks this one's a little better, so he's going to put this one in tonight's cage match.
6338817	6342018	It's Battle Without Honor or Humanity, 88 Severed Limbs mix.
6343439	6344780	Um, Brad, your thoughts?
6346440	6347661	Fucking spectacular.
6348281	6351242	Oh my god, dude, that was awesome, that's all I have to say.
6351262	6353463	That is getting 5,000 out of 10.
6357247	6357827	So there you go.
6358128	6359068	I'm stroking as you go.
6360309	6361710	Looks like you're stroking your dick there, too.
6361730	6362770	That song made you so happy.
6362970	6367433	Well, I got some sticky stuff on my fingers from licking something.
6368914	6369755	Will, your thoughts?
6371836	6372416	Pretty cool.
6372676	6376319	I like the rap part thing that went with it.
6377459	6378360	Sounds good to me.
6378880	6379160	Ten.
6379861	6381422	Alright, ten from Will as well.
6381462	6381842	Loki?
6384584	6385104	I give it a ten.
6386607	6388088	G, Stroke Your Own Ego Much?
6388188	6388709	No, I'm just kidding.
6388909	6389189	Terry.
6390671	6394995	Yeah, that song pretty much owned the rest of the song, so I'd give that one.
6396336	6398077	Yeah, I like 23 Maguses.
6398398	6398758	I'd give it an 88.
6398818	6401561	All right.
6402421	6402822	Bradley.
6404303	6404703	I liked it.
6404723	6405324	It was good.
6405344	6412470	I mean, not that as really blown away, but it was good.
6412490	6412871	I'd give it a 9.
6414560	6416742	I don't know, I feel weird today, so...
6433922	6434943	BPM for my songs
6454882	6456483	So when I'm mixing, it's accurate.
6457143	6465306	And then I just happened to play Battle Without a Cause, so I went ahead and threw that in there in the acid, and it happened just to fit with the first song I had there.
6465686	6472048	In fact, the guitar and the main synth to it, you can't even hear it because they're blended together so well.
6472108	6472948	So I was like, oh, okay.
6473668	6480691	And then the rap part, I just like that from the, you know, that was my favorite part in that one song anyway, so I just threw that in there also, and it turned out well.
6482958	6483338	All right.
6483879	6484580	Fucking fabulous.
6484600	6485160	What can I say?
6485360	6485721	All right.
6485841	6486702	Let's review.
6486822	6487442	But you know what?
6487542	6491266	As much as we might like that song, it's really up to you guys in the chat room.
6491306	6492327	You guys have the vote.
6492407	6493348	So here it is.

6565933	6566953	Almost enough for a CD.
6567154	6567514	Almost.
6570517	6570837	Something.
6571257	6571778	No, that's alright.
6572278	6574500	I think, actually, why don't we play that other Loki mix?
6574540	6577803	Do you want to talk about your other remix that you did this week, Loki, that you want to debut tonight?
6578942	6590691	I did this one this morning because actually it was something that Angel is working on right now and so I give her credit for the name and DarkTexi also came up with the name and IDA last night.
6591051	6597455	But I just threw one together to see how it would end up because they were working on it and so I was like okay well I'll work on my version of it.
6597836	6600738	This is QQQ and Quasar.
6601238	6606822	They don't really go together, but, you know, I just figured, you know, for the hell of it, just to try it and see if it worked.
6606942	6611485	And what else is QQ... QQQQuasar, I guess.
6611926	6612146	Whatever.
6612726	6613627	QQQuasar.
6613667	6618210	Alright, so this is kind of something you... an idea you ruthlessly stole from Angel, basically.
6619231	6621272	Well, actually, just from the chatroom in general.
6621733	6625635	I just did it for the hell of it, just to see, you know, what it was.
6625675	6626276	I don't know, whatever.
6627591	6629654	Alright, let's check this out.
6629674	6631958	This is the other new Loki remix we have to debut tonight.
6632018	6635162	It's Loki vs. Tack with QQ Quasar.
6735885	6737686	All right, that's the other Loki song we want to debut tonight.
6737746	6743808	Loki vs. Tack with QQ Quasar, an idea that was ruthlessly stolen from our chat room, but you did a nice job with it.
6743968	6744489	Very nice.
6744569	6749831	As some folks are saying, well, Brad, tell listeners what you've been saying while that song's playing.
6751517	6752378	Oh, well, I like it.
6752458	6753538	I think it's cool.
6753599	6755300	It sounds interesting, but I don't know.
6755360	6759383	I don't think Quasar will really fit with any other song.
6759403	6764966	I think the way it was written and flows and everything, it kind of just, it's a solo, singular song.
6765006	6766928	It doesn't seem to want to mix with anything, it seems like.
6767608	6768769	But it still sounds interesting.
6768869	6769650	I kind of like it.
6770490	6773512	I think QQQ would have a lot more potential with some other song.
6773552	6778516	I can't think right off the bat what it would mix better with, but still a good effort.
6778536	6778936	I like it.
6780204	6781645	No, not electrical parade music.
6781825	6782305	Well, I don't know.
6782725	6785326	Maybe you could make it sound good, but we'll see.
6786587	6790548	There was some song on, because we had this soundtrack for the Disneyland Park.
6790588	6793689	It was all the music from the rides before they had Splash Mountain.
6793729	6795390	Well, it was even with Splash Mountain and stuff.
6796010	6798011	And there was one of the songs in there that was...
6800305	6800986	God, I can't remember.
6801006	6807230	It was something from Tomorrowland, and it had a song that sounded just like that, like the quacking type thing.
6807390	6812133	It was like, it wasn't Electrical Parade, it was something like that, though.
6812673	6814014	I don't remember exactly what it is.
6814834	6817076	But that song would go good with this, because it sounds the same.
6821459	6821819	Okay.
6823033	6824494	All right.
6825215	6825935	Let's see.
6826656	6830919	I'm going to give a couple more minutes for the cage match votes to come in.
6832400	6838984	In the meantime, gosh, I'm stretched for topics to talk about tonight.
6839024	6840806	What's on your guys' mind?
6841086	6842527	Anything related?
6843598	6846101	Well, I've been working on my little thing.
6846181	6848984	I didn't get to meet with Keith this week, so that made me mad.
6849585	6855292	But I've been working on my list for this thing that I'm doing.
6857714	6864498	It sucks because I was going on DDR Mania X because they have a thread about remaking banners that would work perfectly for what I'm doing.
6865418	6874223	The thing is, a certain somebody that we used to know that used to be in our chatroom but got banned from our chatroom went ahead and went and fucked up the DDR Mania X forums.
6874583	6882067	So if you take a look at DDR Mania X's forums, you'll see that a certain somebody that goes by the name Newt decided to take it.
6882427	6885590	Take a poop on the forums there and fuck them all up.
6886291	6888232	So, you can thank him for that.
6889353	6894798	And, um, I don't know, other than that, um, nothing much.
6895139	6896460	We've been playing with the iToy.
6896700	6899202	That, I guess, is supposed to have a game coming out.
6899683	6901685	Oh, fuck, the iToy is marvelous.
6901725	6903907	What do you guys think of iToy, those of you that have seen it?
6904067	6907550	iToy is just, it's like Angel said, it's like being in Nick Arcade.
6909284	6917074	All I have to say is I want to... Yeah, do... Okay, anyway, I don't want to embarrass myself anymore.
6917535	6922942	That little dance game with the little gungoro girl, with the fake and baked tan, is so cute.
6923062	6923603	Oh my god.
6924304	6926766	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6944620	6949923	Licensed Music in it, and it is a game that will watch your motion and somehow judge your dancing ability.
6950003	6951224	I don't know how this is going to work yet.
6951604	6955706	I've seen limited screenshots on GameSpot and all that stuff.
6957307	6957827	But I don't know.
6957867	6960229	The iToy is a very interesting piece of technology.
6962030	6964231	But it's another one of those things that I think kind of loses it.
6965819	6966840	It's kind of a party game.
6967260	6968201	I know where it is.
6968281	6969523	I'll find it later.
6970303	6974928	It's kind of one of those things that loses its flair when you're playing it by yourself.
6974968	6975849	It's more of a party game.
6976009	6977711	It would be the best thing ever drunk.
6978131	6984538	I could see myself drunk and playing that sparkles mode where all your motion creates little rainbow sparkles on the screen.
6984598	6986119	I could see that entertaining myself for hours.
6987200	6989902	That's so a stoner game too, you know, with the bubbles.
6991702	6992843	Oh, it popped!
6993543	6994224	Sweet!
6995764	6996565	Colors!
6997185	7000987	It's just like so... It's just a stoner game.
7001087	7002408	It's like a game for everyone.
7002948	7007450	You can play this game and no matter what, you know, just find something that you'll enjoy in it.
7007810	7010352	I mean, they've got some pretty fun stuff, and they have a mode in there.
7010832	7014734	It's a game that's just like that, um, Fantavision, where it's with, um...
7016466	7016786	Fireworks
7032752	7038613	It's just so funny because you see, like, on the screen, you can see yourself mirrored in, you know, doing what you're doing.
7038973	7043755	And, like, everybody, like, when they break the boards, they're, like, using their hands like this.
7044195	7047575	You can't really see it, but they're pointing it straight out like they're doing, like, a paper and rock, paper, scissors.
7047855	7049476	And they poke it with their fingers.
7049816	7050456	Poke the board!
7050816	7052056	And it, like, breaks all.
7052376	7053817	And they'll hit it with their elbow.
7054197	7054797	It's good stuff.
7055457	7062120	The one that was hilarious to me was the Ice Queen was over and he hates spiders more than anything.
7062200	7064301	And there's a spider thing on there.
7064641	7069904	And it's great because what the spiders do is it puts a bunch of spiders on the screen that are attracted to motion.
7070344	7073646	So if you move a little bit, the spiders will jump on you really quickly.
7073746	7074726	It's so funny.
7075006	7077828	They attach themselves to your head and they don't get off.
7077908	7081049	It made the Ice Queen run out of the room screaming like the faggy is.
7081129	7081730	It was great.
7081830	7082290	I loved it.
7083050	7083610	and so on.
7103158	7104199	Oh, yeah.
7104460	7106142	So, iToy, good thing, bad thing?
7106422	7107303	What the hell is this thing?
7107463	7112208	Is it going to go the way of the Super Scope and all these other peripherals that only ever had one game out?
7112989	7116593	There's no way to know where it's going to go, but I think if we get some...
7118075	7119796	What's the word I'm looking for?
7119876	7124360	Imaginative game developers to use this peripheral for something else?
7124700	7127782	I think there's some huge possibilities for this thing.
7127922	7135608	If anything, you're going to see it used for a bunch of different applications, not necessarily as a full game, but add-on things.
7135848	7138349	For instance, I'm sure they're going to do this.
7138610	7143133	You'll be playing a first-person shooter, and you can take a screen cap of your face and post it on your...
7143493	7144313	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7172939	7174180	All around you.
7175581	7179023	But it plays, to me, more like Space Channel 5.
7179743	7183005	You'll do something, and then you have to do... It plays like Parappa to me more.
7183065	7183465	Well, okay.
7183565	7184646	I can see Space Channel 5.
7184726	7186027	It's exactly like Space Channel 5.
7186107	7186907	I can see Space Channel 5.
7187168	7190349	I was thinking more Parappa, but Space Channel 5 is probably a better description for it.
7190610	7195693	And then there's a Beatmania quote-unquote game in there, too, which is the same thing, except it's four speakers in the corner.
7196053	7197354	And it has a licensed song in it.
7197394	7199255	Yeah, it has the... Singing it back...
7200035	7202358	Swing it back, sing it back to me
7212918	7216782	I think my favorite game in the whole thing, though, was the Fantavision one, the fireworks one.
7216802	7217202	Yeah, that one's fun.
7217222	7219144	That was cool, because the little detonating things on the side.
7219164	7219684	That one's really fun.
7219704	7221386	You know, like, hitting, touching the fireworks, and boom!
7221586	7222487	And the music's great.
7222507	7224769	It's hella, like, ravery, heart-knocking.
7224789	7224989	Yes.
7225089	7225670	It's really good.
7226571	7227071	Good times.
7227431	7230855	And I love taking the pictures of yourself with little profiles.
7232256	7235138	I think Xbox should do one of these for Xbox Live.
7235219	7236420	They would have a ball with this.
7237714	7241836	And the greatest thing ever is when they do a picture for the high scores.
7241896	7245177	When you score, you know, top score or whatever, you take a photo.
7245837	7247718	And their photo gets stuck with the high score.
7248058	7248738	That's the greatest.
7249018	7249539	It's funny.
7250079	7252560	I love how for your profile you get the pictures.
7252580	7257802	The three pictures, it'll tell you the picture of like a... It says do a happy face, then a sad face, then a silly face.
7258142	7265865	And so when you go to the profiles to select your character you want to play as, like Matt will have his own and Rob will have his own, it shows their faces changing from like happy, sad...
7266405	7266726	Silly.
7267687	7272573	Or then they have some really pointless modes, but they're kind of fun even still, like the window washing.
7272973	7275717	Oh, the window washing with a weird song in the background.
7276397	7279041	Like this old 40s, when I'm washing windows.
7279742	7281684	Like this really hella old 40s or 30s song.
7283722	7284663	It's just perfect though.
7284803	7285204	It fits.
7285964	7286425	Good stuff.
7286845	7287285	Yeah.
7287505	7287986	Good times.
7288887	7289167	Very.
7290028	7303219	But actually, I remember a long time ago, we were reading up on, they were doing, they were developing a Dance Dance Revolution type thing with motion capturing just like this, and I remember looking and going, that's stupid.
7303739	7304320	And you know what?
7304520	7308123	If I think, when I see this new dancing game, I think I'll think the exact same thing.
7308143	7308924	That'll be stupid.
7310526	7317379	I mean, because it's a good concept, but it's not, you know, for like people doing it for like accuracy.
7317439	7319524	It's like, you know, all the PA-ers out there.
7320717	7321537	It's not going to work.
7321657	7323938	Yeah, it's not super accurate.
7324679	7337863	I was getting kind of frustrated because I felt like I was hitting it on time, like rhythm and stuff, but it's just... You've got to be really... Like, there's a game in there where it's a mirror game where you have to hit these... You have to hit the green ones and not the red ones or you get penalized.
7337883	7338764	They're like these little bubbles.
7339144	7346767	And what happens is it creates like a mirror effect where one half of the screen changes upside down and whatnot, so you would expect...
7348097	7351300	When you raise your hand to touch it, it goes in a completely opposite way.
7351320	7352000	It's hard to explain.
7352020	7352560	You'd have to see it.
7352600	7361206	But the thing is that since you're raising your arm, any part of your arm can touch the sensor area on the screen and you fuck yourself up.
7361567	7364389	So it's just not a very accurate type of sensor.
7364409	7369232	Or, depending on the lighting in your room, a shadow could set it off.
7369272	7369932	Yeah, exactly.
7371053	7374035	It's not the most accurate style of whatnot.
7374095	7375216	You know what I mean?
7376137	7376677	What the hell?
7378243	7379904	Oh, they're... Okay, anyway.
7381184	7385325	Okay, I think it's time to announce the winner of the Orange Lounge Cage Match.
7385345	7385945	What do you guys think?
7386186	7386566	You!
7386906	7389467	Alright, here is tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge Cage Match.
7390087	7392708	I think this one isn't too difficult to figure out.
7392928	7393908	It wasn't unanimous!
7394328	7395749	I thought it would be, but it was not.
7395809	7398389	But it was a pretty big landslide nonetheless.
7398789	7400330	This is tonight's Cage Match winner.
7402931	7406492	Battle Without Honor or Humanity, the 88 Severed Limbs mix, of course.
7408502	7411304	wins tonight's Orange Lounge cage match.
7412465	7413326	You guys cool with that?
7413766	7414026	Alright.
7415067	7415367	Alright.
7415848	7417049	Loki's like, hell yeah, I'm cool with that.
7417529	7423674	Alright, so that'll come back and fight next week and see if it can... The chatroom was saying they want that in all month.
7423914	7425275	They want to make that one go for a month.
7425315	7425675	We'll see.
7425775	7426096	We'll see.
7426846	7428306	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7448613	7453638	Just the artist is credited with DDR, and it's all these DDR songs mixed together, so we'll hear that.
7453738	7459483	Good Cool featuring Jeff Coot with Blaster, I promised that one, so we're going to hear Blaster this break.
7460283	7462285	And, you know what?
7462986	7463606	Hey, Brad?
7465328	7466028	I need your help here.
7466088	7471453	Is Iconoclasm, is that the Taka featuring DJW one?
7471553	7473134	I cannot, they totally changed their name.
7473434	7474816	I'm not sure if it's that or not.
7475336	7476097	The Anthem Trance?
7476117	7476257	Taka.
7477864	7478485	Taka and DJW.
7478505	7480046	Okay, we're going to hear that one, too.
7480086	7483088	The Taka and DJW in the genre of Anthem Trance.
7483148	7489233	It's Vatam Stellaru, and they call themselves Iconoclasm, which is why I was thrown off, because I couldn't remember what they had called themselves.
7489633	7490954	So we're going to hear all that this break.
7491014	7497239	The DDR Megamix, Good Coolin' Jeff Coot, and Taka and W. When we come back, the FUs of the week.
7497559	7498000	We'll be back.
7614447	7615855	Thank you for watching!
7644649	7645354	Thank you guys for listening.
7789962	7790968	Thank you for watching!
7855955	7856677	DarkSakura
7916068	7917329	Thank you for watching!
7948649	7954331	Hello, we are back and you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 68 in progress.
7955931	7961813	And they're just talking about popping music right now, kind of Loki promoting his cabinet again.
7963293	7966014	Let's get your guys' reactions to the songs in that set.
7966054	7969655	First off, we had the DDR Megamix.
7970175	7971596	We might have a surprise visitor here.
7972453	7975195	Hey, Zero and Jason are here.
7975275	7975795	Hello.
7976955	7977436	What is up?
7978596	7978936	Sorry.
7981618	7982118	My bad.
7985540	7985860	Alright.
7986300	7991083	We're going to... Let's revisit the songs in that break.
7991103	7991863	See what you guys thought of them.
7992183	7995505	First off was the DDR Megamix from the Pop Music 10 soundtrack.
7999088	8000610	Oh, great, I played the bag part.
8000650	8001291	Let me skip ahead.
8001311	8008098	Alright, what did you guys think of the DDR Megamix from Pop Music 10?
8008839	8010120	Why is bag in there?
8010140	8011041	That was my thought, too.
8011081	8011882	Why is bag in there?
8013103	8014525	That's not a highlight of DDR.
8014565	8019831	It's alright, but the thing is, is that, like, do we need to hear, like, Before You anymore?
8021815	8024037	or D2R or whatever was all those songs in there.
8024117	8025378	Like, we've heard those so many times.
8025418	8026078	We don't need them again.
8026158	8026599	Yeah, I agree.
8027139	8030862	Maybe we can make some new before you remix type stuff.
8031663	8032123	Okay, anyway.
8032143	8033144	Do you have any thoughts on that movie?
8034945	8035486	It was okay.
8035506	8036707	I don't know.
8037467	8043091	I just, I could see them putting this in like another version of DDR just as a thing.
8046294	8046794	Okay, cool.
8047135	8050958	The other song we heard in that break was Good Cool featuring Jeff Coot with Blame
8052062	8052843	I'm sorry, not Blaine.
8052863	8053623	That was their other song.
8053643	8054524	This was Blaster.
8059869	8061170	What do you guys think of Blaster?
8063912	8065594	I don't know about Blaster, but hi, Angel.
8066943	8067904	What'd you think of Blaster?
8069045	8069225	Me?
8069445	8069665	Yeah.
8070066	8072728	Okay, I am a huge Jeff Koop fan, dude.
8073528	8075870	He makes me warm and gooey inside.
8077191	8078953	It's nothing compared to his... Hey, shut up.
8079493	8087300	It's nothing compared to his, like, turning the motor over or blame or blowing my heart away, but since it's Jeff Koop, I'll still...
8088137	8092458	I still say they need to put Rollercoaster of Love in fucking Guitar Freak.
8092478	8093478	Yeah, that's true.
8093518	8095319	Whatever, I mean, I like the Chili Pepper version, though.
8095379	8095619	That's...
8112113	8115459	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8124420	8126221	Somebody in the chatroom says Jeff Cooch.
8127722	8131244	Jeff Cooch.
8132825	8141950	Also in that break we heard Taka and DJW coming together as Iconoclasm with a song called, and this is kind of tricky, it's Vatum Stellarum.
8142650	8143431	A little bit of Latin there.
8147793	8150255	What did you think of the Taka and DJW one?
8152543	8161805	I like DJ Taka, but he's been bringing out a lot of more generic stuff lately, and I think he kind of poisoned DJW with that genericness he's been bringing out.
8161845	8164546	So I'm not blown away by this song, but it is still pretty good.
8165846	8169947	It's No Rainbow Flyer, which I think is the best song he's done in a long time.
8170108	8171368	Because it has the word rainbow in it.
8171488	8172248	Oh, shut up.
8173148	8174229	But it is...
8176542	8177462	Decent, I guess.
8178362	8179503	But it sounds just like emotion.
8180423	8182984	And I don't hear DJW really in it at all.
8183844	8186064	If you just told me it was a DJ Taka song, I would have believed you.
8187165	8187645	You would have what?
8188405	8190645	I would have believed you if you just told me it was a DJ Taka song.
8192086	8193746	The DJW part is very subtle.
8194226	8197627	If I can recall, I heard some quick piano-y stuff in there.
8197687	8200328	That's kind of like a DJW thing to do.
8201208	8203729	Really fast piano playing is DJW's thing.
8203749	8204889	Do you have any thoughts on that, Loki?
8206698	8207179	It was okay.
8207359	8207999	I liked it.
8208079	8210001	It sounded kind of trancy and nice.
8210942	8212023	Trancy and nice.
8212403	8212763	I don't know.
8212843	8218528	Taka just hasn't really... I just don't really care about Taka and Tack anymore.
8218568	8223372	It's like Tack did better stuff on his album, you know, the remixes, like Paranoia and stuff.
8225674	8238922	DJ Tarka's last really, really good song was stuff off maybe, or maybe Rainbow Flyer probably was his last really good song.
8239042	8241724	Like, Fifth Mix was, like, good for both of them.
8241744	8242624	I mean, that was some good stuff.
8242644	8243185	You're talking about D.R.
8243205	8243585	Fifth Mix?
8244025	8244825	No, Beatmania.
8244965	8245706	Beatmania 5th?
8245886	8246926	Or 2DX, I mean.
8247206	8248367	2DX, oh, 5th Style.
8248407	8249447	5th Style, yeah.
8249547	8250327	Like, what songs?
8250387	8251328	I can't... V?
8251528	8253708	Yeah, like, Absolute was on there.
8253929	8256509	Well, Absolute's from, yeah, 3rd.
8257210	8257690	Whatever.
8257890	8261291	Anyways, so, Abyss, that was on there.
8262692	8263032	Sync.
8263592	8264772	Yeah, Sync, well, yeah.
8265273	8266973	Hell yeah, Outface, always good.
8268414	8272115	Summer Vacation, that was the last good thing that... Outface?
8273031	8274452	You don't really care for Quasar?
8275593	8275733	No.
8276574	8277335	I'm sorry.
8278716	8282758	Sync and Summer Vacation are still way better, but I don't know, Quasar's still alright.
8283899	8288323	See, it's like Taka is just getting about as old as Naoki Underground.
8288863	8292646	I mean, that stuff is so generic and repetitive sounding.
8293046	8294367	Why does it have to be Naoki Underground?
8294387	8295408	Why don't you just say Naoki?
8296288	8298210	That's as old and generic as you get right there.
8299215	8305660	Well, at least he's like, you know, he does different genres of music, even though he may put himself under different names and stuff.
8305720	8313306	It's just... Well, DJ Taka's been doing a lot of, like with Night Style, like these more J-pop-y sounding songs lately.
8313386	8316529	So he's kind of changing up his genre, but I don't think he's doing very good.
8316549	8318931	I don't want to hear Sylvia Drive ever again.
8319051	8322133	I was pissed off that he didn't even, um, Emotion 2003 anyways.
8322173	8326296	They've already done a romantic style of Emotion that was in, um, what was it...
8327177	8330961	See, they made Romantic style, and that was pretty cool.
8330981	8332243	I liked that better than the original.
8332323	8337949	But then they're like, we need it to be a little more trancy, so let's do Romantic 2003 or whatever it's called.
8338970	8339310	Lame.
8339611	8341012	Yeah, I think it was a little overdone.
8342534	8343535	So what are we talking about?
8344205	8347648	Uh, you guys are having an argument about whether Taka sold out or not or whatever it is.
8347668	8349109	Well, I think Taka's just getting soft.
8349349	8349649	Alright.
8350409	8352551	Okay, uh, let's do the FUs of the week then.
8352851	8354212	Speaking of ranting about things.
8354232	8354932	I'll leave now.
8355052	8356834	It's time for the FUs of the week!
8362838	8363598	Oh, this is bad.
8363738	8365399	Here is justice.
8365760	8368261	Here is punishment.
8368722	8371644	Here is... This is fucked up.
8371684	8371764	Here.
8373075	8381482	Well, this is the part where Jamie would usually do her FUs, because this is her little retarded baby that has grown into an hour-long segment every week's show.
8381903	8389569	But she didn't send me anything over mail, or I haven't gotten anything on email, and I didn't get a phone call or anything.
8390090	8393213	So, FU to Jamie for not sending me FUs!
8393573	8394013	No, I'm kidding.
8394053	8394394	I'm kidding.
8394414	8394774	We miss you.
8394814	8395294	I'll do Jamie's.
8395735	8396756	Fuck you to traffic.
8396796	8397837	Fuck you to being sick.
8398457	8400399	Fuck you to Xbox, there you go.
8400859	8402360	And fuck you to Roosevelt Golf Line Children.
8402481	8405463	Fuck you to bad Chinese food, fuck you to Roosevelt Golf Line Children.
8405983	8407285	Alright, fair enough.
8407445	8409586	Okay, so we're just going to skip to Loki then.
8410187	8414451	And Loki, per your request earlier this week, I went ahead and changed your music.
8418814	8420395	Oh yes, I remember that now.
8421536	8423398	God damn it, why does he have to remember everything?
8425919	8428021	Fuck your goddamn speed music.
8428322	8428982	I hate it.
8429163	8432086	And the fact that you make speed Christmas music is even worse.
8432366	8433708	Because I hate Christmas music.
8434068	8440996	Why the hell does every store in the face of the earth have to play goddamn Christmas music, like, right after fucking Halloween?
8441336	8441677	Okay?
8441797	8443118	It's not Christmas yet.
8445660	8448882	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
8465239	8472924	But no, you know, instead of having the songs nice and short, they have to, you know, make extended versions and just speed them twice as fast as their regular size.
8473384	8475765	Mmm, Gearbox, uh-huh.
8476406	8479147	Hey now, Gearbox star, get your game on.
8479227	8479688	Oh, sorry!
8484227	8489013	My second FU of the week is going to be going to G4 for their poor programming.
8489453	8495360	I watched a nice segment on Dance Dance Revolution and these people covering it knew nothing about the game.
8495661	8497683	I don't even think they knew what they were doing there.
8498003	8501908	They were talking to these people asking them, So, what's your highest score?
8502048	8503070	And the guy's looking at them like...
8504090	8506212	Dude, have you seen the new Tetris game?
8506232	8507393	Aeris dies.
8526368	8529572	It's just, it's stupid, it's like, we have to recolonize our planet.
8529773	8532676	It's not a planet, it's a puzzle game.
8533117	8534259	Puzzle game.
8534859	8536281	No need for anything else.
8537082	8537443	Okay?
8538104	8538184	Um.
8539378	8554764	Also, fuck you too, a lot of the stupid movies that are coming out lately, like Master and Commander of the Far Sea, I mean, no one wants to see stupid people sailing and ships blowing up and ships, shit like that.
8554784	8557044	Wait, this is the What's His Name movie, right?
8557865	8559805	Yeah, that guy who doesn't make good stuff.
8559826	8560806	What's his name, the Australian guy?
8561892	8562452	Russell Crowe?
8562472	8563293	Russell Crowe, yeah.
8563953	8566674	Who wants to watch Russell Crowe be a stupid sailor god?
8567094	8567895	Russell Crowe is true.
8567915	8569135	Oh wait, does he die in the movie?
8569835	8570015	No.
8570296	8571176	Oh, then it's not worth saying.
8572116	8578779	Does he, like, bust out, like, a shield and sword and start cutting people's heads off and stuff and say, I am the greatest gladiator?
8579399	8579559	No.
8580500	8585622	So, um, yeah, that sucked, and, um,
8587484	8594847	I had more at Fuse earlier this week, and because it's Sunday, I just get all relaxed by the weekend, and half of the stuff goes away.
8594867	8601549	I thought that the music might help, might jog my memory, but all I can say is I hate old people.
8603089	8605970	I hate them to hell, and old people just really suck.
8606050	8609952	I hate reality TV, because these new shows that they come up with, like this
8610692	8611152	And finally, um...
8639324	8664860	I don't know, I can't, oh, FU Yahoo for covering the dumbest news stories ever, like, for instance, the solar flares, no one cares about the solar flares, didn't happen, nothing really, you know, happened to us, um, also, just, they have, like, um, studies about, like, different things, like, games are addictive, you know, that shit, it's really lame, like, um,
8666360	8669501	This is what I'm saying, if you set fire to yourself, it will hurt.
8670841	8673142	So, I'm done.
8676163	8682144	I like boobies too, but just because I like boobies doesn't mean you have to keep writing boobies.
8686805	8687505	So, yeah.
8688706	8689006	I'm done.
8691486	8692887	And burn this fucking CD!
8694793	8696633	They sent you Beethoven!
8699874	8704255	Alright, uh, hold on, I think of something else real fast, I'm dealing with some things in the chatroom, hold on.
8706195	8708496	Let's watch some gay porn so we can get our hate back.
8709316	8710516	Fucking A, dude, seriously.
8711477	8717738	No, I hate fucking pop-ups and shit, and I'm still getting them like hell, and all these people are telling me, you know,
8718188	8720869	They actually increased my penis size and all this stuff.
8721550	8722630	It's just really annoying.
8722870	8723671	They can hit, man.
8725912	8728833	Did you know that they say my breasts are too small, too?
8728853	8729553	Yeah, I know, me too.
8729573	8730354	I get this all the time.
8730694	8732535	And my clitoris is too small.
8732595	8734055	My ovaries are too big.
8734135	8741619	If we were to follow all their, you know, instructions, we'd be titty-fucking ourselves every day, so... Damn, and the only spam I get is Tubgirl.
8744700	8744820	Oh.
8745601	8745901	Sorry.
8747628	8750330	Everyone go to www.tubgirl.com right now.
8772900	8777283	Well, I'm not going to give it out over the air, because who knows, and everybody's going to send me Tug Girl, because they think it'll be funny.
8778224	8786349	Okay, everybody, go to www.goatse.cx Jesus Christ, just kill yourself.
8786369	8787990	Oh, that's it, my turn, my turn.
8790191	8790651	My F.U.
8790671	8794734	of the week goes to these fucking retarded internet jokes that are five years old.
8797079	8802143	Hey, go to Goat Say, it's funny, this guy stretching his ass, ew.
8802703	8803284	God.
8803304	8809348	Top Girl, oh, it's so funny, hey, she shit herself, isn't that great, ew, look at that.
8810049	8812271	God, shut the fuck up.
8812771	8820574	If you're going to send around an internet joke, at least make it a funny internet joke, like ghetto Barbie or whatever that was.
8820674	8822695	No, I'm sorry.
8822775	8826336	I know a lot of people hate it still, but you can't go wrong with All Your Base.
8826356	8826997	It's a classic.
8827057	8827797	It's the original.
8828337	8832739	This is funny because Japanese people actually wrote this this way.
8832899	8835220	All Your Base was not part of my FU.
8835280	8836800	That can stay.
8836961	8839361	But Goat Say and all this other stuff has to go.
8839441	8840302	Yes, that's dumb.
8841454	8843796	or at least come up with something else funny.
8843836	8850200	Like, you know, how about a woman in a new compromising position or a guy doing another amazing thing to his body.
8853783	8855004	Okay, send me that.
8855044	8856165	No one's sent me that yet.
8857666	8862449	There's the new fetish where women kick guys full on in the groin really hard and they get off on it.
8862589	8863950	That'll probably be a new joke soon.
8863970	8865591	Yes, somebody send me bum fights.
8865771	8866712	I haven't seen this yet.
8866752	8867993	It might still be funny, see?
8868033	8868914	I'm just joking.
8870188	8870588	All right.
8870969	8871369	God.
8874471	8883276	I just hate it when people post this on forums to try to, like, there's something new that, like, ha, this is so funny, my friend just showed it to me.
8883556	8887859	Chances are if your friend just showed it to you, it's like five years old.
8887919	8889200	Your friend's just retarded.
8889320	8890020	Unless you're me.
8890360	8891321	Have you seen fart pudding?
8893727	8894388	I don't want to!
8895790	8901219	My favorite ones are the ones where they post stuff like about, New DDR Extreme skin for Step Mania!
8901279	8902420	And it's a link to Goatse.
8903282	8904103	Or Redirect.
8906246	8908950	Oh yeah, if you're the one that's... Those are the best.
8909841	8911602	Hey, you can go to hell if that's you doing that.
8912242	8914523	This is a special place in hell, just for you.
8915044	8917825	I want to do one that sends you to, like, install Gator on your computer.
8917845	8918625	That would be the best.
8918966	8920907	Dude, I don't even know how to do it.
8920967	8925209	I'm going to buy... The goats that go down, I'm going to buy it and put in a Gator ad.
8925269	8927210	I'm going to make zillions of money off this.
8928730	8931351	What was that other one you were talking about last week?
8932512	8932752	What?
8932992	8935713	The one that we were... Yeah, Gain, I think.
8935793	8939014	Gain, Gator... No, the one that you could not get rid of last week.
8939054	8942236	It was the... Not Jupiter, but it was one of them in that family.
8942856	8946177	It's like Jupiter, but with an X. Lop.
8946297	8947078	Lop.com.
8947178	8947478	Lop.
8947798	8948498	Ugh, evil.
8948818	8950239	Do not visit Lop.com.
8950279	8951119	You'll be sorry.
8951139	8952039	Okay.

9066477	9067818	All right, I guess I have a couple of FUs.
9067838	9072582	FU to companies that like to outsource everything to India to save money.
9073583	9075964	They put all people out of jobs and they all wander around.
9076665	9080248	It makes it nice for when I'm hiring, but, you know, it still sucks when people are out of jobs.
9081289	9082630	FU to lots of bills.
9083430	9086853	FU to triple car tax, my truck tax.

9089775	9090015	Oh, my God.
9090035	9090496	Yep, it tripled.

9100711	9105275	How about... That's all I have, because I can't think of anything.
9105715	9106336	Alright, fair enough.
9107057	9109699	Bradley, Arcadian42, what are your FUs of the week?
9110179	9110860	Fuck you too.
9111681	9115885	Be on the edge of out of money and all that other stuff and various things like that as usual.
9116225	9117186	Fuck you, don't have any job yet.
9118234	9121876	Fuck you to my ladies and gentlemen for not getting the job yet.
9122377	9123677	Fuck you to bad drivers, of course.
9123878	9128360	One guy almost tried to hit me when he was changing lanes, but I think the cops caught him, so fuck you to him.
9129501	9131202	And thank you to the cops for catching that idiot.
9132863	9134144	Fuck you to disappearing pencils.
9134164	9137606	They run away from me and disappear to different rooms.
9137626	9138666	They say, where did the pencil go?
9138686	9142709	I have, like, four pencils and they disappear at various points.
9143369	9144670	And, uh, some more pencils.
9146222	9148404	and, uh, Tentacle.

9156131	9164118	I don't have a whole lot, but I will have to say fuck you to the customers who come in and tell me that I don't know what I'm doing, even though I sell video games and I've been playing them all my fucking life.
9165139	9172606	And, yeah, fuck you to people who want Karaoke Revolution and we don't have it, and so I have to go get it for them.
9173470	9175473	Added in at a decreased price.
9177936	9178617	Oh, I'm sorry.
9180299	9182142	No, it didn't matter because I wanted to get out of it.
9182382	9183584	I needed to take a break.
9183764	9184085	Anyway.
9187950	9188631	Because we were out.
9189606	9209834	Um, yeah, fuck you to having a car now, because I have to go and fucking park all the way at Cal Expo, because a stupid fucking mall security little fucking police squad dropouts come up and harass our store specifically and tell us, if you park your cars anywhere else but Cal Expo, we're gonna tow it.
9210654	9213035	And they're like picking on us, so we're making their job harder.
9214116	9214196	Um...
9215549	9222753	Yes, and fuck you to people who tell me to fuck you because I'm getting like a TV and a computer.
9223174	9223594	You know what?
9223734	9224895	Those are gifts, dick.
9226095	9229698	Anyways, Jason, you're a dick.
9230938	9234661	And by the way, that stuff that I'm getting is a gift, so fuck off.
9235421	9239984	Not like you don't get to benefit from it anyway, so shut up.
9240784	9245247	Yeah, and which reminds me, I'm gonna have everybody over Friday night to play games on...
9246400	9247000	Yeah, this one.
9247221	9247601	Everybody.
9248962	9249542	Everybody.
9250383	9251183	Oh, not on my TV.
9251203	9252104	Hell no.
9253024	9254946	You could go stand in the back of the house and do it.
9255346	9256887	That was a good game, come on.
9256987	9258908	On a 17-inch computer monitor, how about that?
9259669	9261890	No, that's really pretty much about it.
9261970	9265112	Oh yeah, and fuck you to not being here for so long because I didn't have a car.
9265192	9266974	So yeah, fuck not having a car too.
9267654	9269415	But I'll be back like every week now.
9269655	9270696	So yay, I'm done.
9274113	9277554	Yeah, I know, this is funny, because we were just saying the other day, we haven't seen Zero in forever.
9277874	9281656	And here I was, thinking it was just going to be me and Loki here tonight, stretching for material.
9282136	9285397	Uh, Brad, your turn, FU's of the Week.
9285517	9286997	Can you sing a different song now?
9287278	9287438	No.
9287958	9288278	Now?
9288438	9288658	No.
9288918	9289878	Anything, I don't care.
9289898	9291939	Alright, hold on, okay, here you go, here you go.
9292819	9293200	Here you go.
9293640	9294380	You can have a line, Suki.
9295757	9296797	Oh wow, thanks.
9296817	9298038	Alright, the FUs please.
9298358	9306300	Okay, uh, of course the old classic FU to this segment, it's stupid, um, and to be the great hypocrisy type thing, you know, I'll go ahead and give another FU.
9306780	9312822	FU to you people who complain about G4, at least you've got the money to or have G4, like, and have cable.
9313442	9316683	Because I have to watch the same three channels over and over again.
9317003	9318743	Thank you Network Local Television.
9320044	9323064	But then again, I do get at least CSI and cheaters.
9324365	9324745	What's this?
9325748	9326268	Hell yeah.
9326288	9330671	Alright, fuck both of you, because my TV doesn't even get the reception for those three channels.
9331892	9342140	Mine doesn't, my TV doesn't, but they have, like, this, uh, this little cable thing that's an antenna that's, like, this huge, supposed to be a huge antenna on top of the whole apartment complex, but you know what I think it is?
9342200	9353668	It's just, like, a piece of tinfoil that's attached to this cable, because I cannot get Fox, like, hardly ever, which sucks, because Fox has, like, I think, Simpsons on it and stuff, and... Fuck it.
9354848	9355349	Yeah, so...
9357076	9357817	God, I hate you.
9358817	9364082	Um, but anyhow, Jurassic Park 4 is awesome, but anyway.
9364662	9372028	Uh, but seriously, man, watch Cheaters, Sunday nights at 1 o'clock or something like that.
9372048	9372508	Good show.
9374810	9375231	Are you done?
9376652	9376912	No!
9377132	9377673	Can I finish?
9378013	9378533	Can I finish?
9378553	9378854	Sure.
9378994	9379434	Can I finish?
9379454	9379734	Sure.
9380095	9380475	Okay, good.
9380555	9380995	Alright.
9381836	9383918	Let's get to the chatroom FUs now.
9387159	9389441	Stupid Baka would like to say, my F.U.

9406629	9406809	F.U.
9406829	9409551	to me because I'm stupid and can't remember any more things I'm mad at.
9412623	9422426	Wampa164 says, F you to shitty rainy weather that prevented my RX-7 from being tuned after a week of being carless.
9424747	9425067	Sucks.
9425707	9430009	Leadfoot says the research paper that won't let itself be finished is an F you.
9431277	9435099	Stabler X says, F you to people who talk in the theaters, they need to be shot.
9435639	9442982	I'll never forget the time I went and saw 28 Days Later, and the part where the guy's naked, the chicks behind me went, I have a little man!
9447504	9449504	Now in that case, that made the movie for me.
9450105	9455347	23 Magus said, F you to asthma, it wouldn't be so bad if you didn't feel like dying every time you had an attack.
9455967	9457988	F you to having no way of getting to the show tonight, Sniff.
9459033	9461756	EvilMalke2DX would like to say, I got me an FU of the week.
9461996	9465100	FU to those people in Rhode Island who accused Uni of being a moocher.
9466021	9466782	Well, that's not cool.
9467983	9469105	Come on, they live in Rhode Island.
9469245	9469705	What do they know?
9470106	9471007	Just kidding, just kidding.
9471567	9472388	Just kidding if you live there.
9472528	9472729	What?
9477222	9481224	Zero scares me with pictures of Kelly Osbourne, and why does he have them on his computer?
9481264	9481965	That's what I want to know.
9482705	9484667	Oh my god, it's a nude picture of Kelly Osbourne!
9484687	9488949	No, because I accidentally downloaded her album, because it came up as something else.
9491391	9492892	You guys are so gullible!
9493012	9494332	Like, three guys jumped off their chairs.
9494533	9496033	Oh my god, nude picture of Kelly Osbourne.
9496053	9497474	She's like 17, you perverts.
9498495	9500196	That's exactly why I want to see it.
9501757	9502637	Dude, it's like fruit.
9502657	9504979	You want it just before it's ripe and ready to be eaten.
9508769	9509369	God!
9512211	9516533	She got ripe a little early, okay?
9516593	9518974	DJ Spector would like to say, F.U.
9519974	9523176	my stupid Spanish teacher, whose name I can't pronounce, I'm not going to try to.
9523696	9525577	And DJ Spector would like to give an F.U.
9525597	9526297	to Politary.
9528098	9530999	Damn, Britney Spears' tits are nice.
9533340	9534381	They keep changing shape.
9536820	9542646	Did Your Angel would like to say, fuck my old job for not scheduling me next week, but that's okay, because guess where I'll be at next week?
9544487	9547350	Alrighty, we'll be seeing her soon.
9548111	9552435	DarkTetsuya would like to second the FU of the week to Christmas Speed.
9555358	9558260	AZNBuddyPaul would like to say, FU to Speed over Beethoven.
9558520	9559882	I don't see what people like in that song.
9560542	9561904	FU to Bill Gates just because.
9564625	9574731	Just because he has billions of dollars you don't have Rice3, or RYC3, Rice, would like to say, fuck you to a boring week, and hi guys!
9577653	9587880	RYC3, Rice Um... Yeah, I got the FP to Paul Terry, I guess that was it Can I get one more?
9589586	9594449	Baka wants to give an FU to a family member who will not let him listen to the rest of the show.
9595030	9598112	So it did me no good to read that because he's not listening anymore.
9598192	9598672	That's too bad.
9599793	9603256	Nothing comes between you and your Orange Lounge radio, goddammit.
9604877	9605238	Alright.
9606278	9606759	That's it.
9606799	9607819	We're done with the FUs of the week.
9608340	9609000	Don't send me more.
9609040	9609581	I don't want to hear them.
9611431	9612572	Dez Q with Jack Girls Band Milk
9632395	9633036	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9801076	9812422	Oki Himawari Sagashini Yuku Toki Toki Yorimichi Shite Konekoto Sareattari
9826681	9833006	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
9853547	9855030	Thank you for watching!
10023510	10029178	Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge mainlining music in Morse Show?
10029458	10036468	The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.
10036769	10036889	It's...
10038297	10038738	on Earthly.
10038958	10042701	It's like being at a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.
10043141	10050447	Alright, we're back on Orange Lounge Radio, and I'm opening up the floor for some quick Ask Orange Lounge before we go off air tonight.
10051088	10058014	But first, while you guys send those questions in over private message to Sky, let's see what you guys thought of those songs.
10058114	10060075	The chat room certainly had some strong opinion on these.
10060576	10065420	The first song we heard in that break was Dez Q, that's Dez Ro and Tack, with a song called Jack.
10070277	10072017	Um, Brad, what'd you think of that?
10072617	10073738	The Desque with Jack.
10074878	10075358	I like it.
10075438	10078279	It's distress and, uh, frickin' gravity mixed together.
10078519	10079219	You know what's interesting?
10079259	10082420	The chatroom, chatroom, worst reviews of the night.
10082480	10083881	They said that song is god-awful.
10084001	10084761	They don't like it at all.
10084821	10085401	Fuck them.
10086122	10088102	This show isn't for them.
10088862	10090263	Big fuck you to the chatroom.
10091918	10098843	I, I, you know what, I, um, I don't think it's awful, but it's, um, for TAC, it's pretty bad.
10099343	10100684	I expect better from TAC.
10102045	10103506	So, that's me personally.
10103926	10105047	Yeah, wah, exactly.
10105207	10106989	Why don't you go sit on a dick or two?
10107789	10108610	If, if I could.
10108630	10114854	Oh, oh, hey, looks like, uh... But you weren't expecting that answer.
10116735	10118797	Uh, Loki, what'd you think of DesQ?
10118837	10118957	DesQ.
10119702	10120322	It's okay.
10120402	10123244	It's just like every other fucking tax song on the face of the earth.
10123284	10124524	They all sound the same now.
10125325	10127826	I could remix it, I guess.
10128786	10129287	That'd be fun.
10130747	10131968	Alright.
10132028	10134049	Anybody else have a thought on DezQ with Jack?
10136877	10137097	What?
10137738	10139418	I should just listen to Captain Jack.
10139478	10141640	Captain Jack is much better than Jack, in my opinion.
10141660	10143221	It does cue with Captain Jack.
10147623	10151165	The next song we heard was a band called Threep, and the song was called Milk.
10153526	10155287	A nice, happy, little, uplifting song.
10156488	10157809	I remember that movie.
10158029	10162832	Oh, no, wait, that was Milk Money, where they saved up their milk money to go to a prostitute.
10162852	10163352	That was cool.
10166257	10166757	The Place To Be
10192148	10197156	and certainly those of you that were visiting Bomani Style for a while probably got fucking sick of this song really fast.
10197336	10198037	Yep, hate it.
10198437	10199759	At least you got to hear the whole thing.
10201742	10202704	You just hate it?
10203605	10205027	Well, after that one... For some reason only?
10205227	10206890	Oh, oh, I know I forgot some...
10207310	10210295	Fuck you, Bomani Style, for still having music on your opening page.
10211777	10212238	You know what?
10212698	10214421	I love Bomani Style.
10214481	10215442	Good guy that runs it.
10215502	10216444	Paranoid is an awesome guy.
10216464	10217005	Great site.
10217045	10217746	Great site.
10217806	10218306	Good stuff.
10218347	10219048	But I don't like that.
10219108	10222032	Horrible choice to put the music on the opening page.
10222973	10226574	Biggest problem is, if it would be nice, here's a suggestion for my staff folks if you're listening.
10227014	10233457	Instead of having the one song in there and changing it every two weeks or so, put like ten songs that randomize.
10233797	10236918	So every time... No, better yet, turn off the fucking music altogether.
10236938	10238459	Do what DR Maniacs did.
10238959	10241960	It's got like a cookie on your computer, okay?
10242400	10245401	If you disable it, it doesn't play until you enable it again.
10245581	10246721	And it does it automatically.
10246901	10247582	And I love that.
10248062	10249122	Otherwise, great site.
10249202	10250483	Or even, you know what, even better...
10251323	10253764	Just have it load Orange Lounge Radio when they go to the front page.
10253804	10254344	Just have it load.
10254704	10260126	And the problem is the thing that turned it off, it takes a while to load up after you know animations and stuff.
10261066	10262667	Bad business decision, whoever did that.
10263367	10266448	Brad, what did you think of that song?
10266648	10272130	The Desiree core groove genre one that got played the hell out on the money style?
10272990	10276411	What did you think of the last half of it that you didn't hear on the money style?
10277732	10278012	What?
10278432	10279292	Alright, you weren't listening.
10279673	10280713	Any other comments on that one?
10282637	10283277	It sucked.
10284178	10285438	Even though I didn't hear the song.
10286498	10287719	I'm not a fan of Dez Ro.
10287759	10292240	I was just listening to this in my car, this song, and it's not, you know, I don't know.
10292380	10293541	Dez Ro is just not that great.
10293781	10299523	I like Daikin Kai, but all the other songs... I can only take... I liked Daikin Kai the first thousand times I heard it.
10300483	10301203	I still like it.
10302624	10302924	Huh?
10309266	10309606	Alright.
10311145	10311865	Um, here we go.
10311925	10314806	We're going to do some quick Ask Orange Lounge before we end tonight's show.
10314846	10315386	You guys ready?
10322208	10323449	Let's Ask Orange Lounge.
10323989	10325149	Some stupid question.
10325830	10328991	Why wasn't this song in Karaoke Revolution?
10329011	10331291	Because there's no words, Yamora.
10331311	10332612	Because there is no words.
10332972	10333892	But I could have made them up.
10334052	10334832	I could have made them up.
10334932	10336173	Konami, email me.
10337193	10338373	Rob Suckercock.
10339654	10339954	Alright.
10341269	10341669	or two.
10342270	10343911	You know, there's this movement now.
10344191	10354178	Some of the cool kids in the Bomani scene are trying to flood Konami with requests to put Murmur Twins in... Yeah, I know, I was going to say... What, Zero?
10354578	10356720	There are no cool kids in the DDR scene, right?
10356920	10358621	Yeah, that's kind of my thoughts exactly, too.
10358701	10363625	But nevertheless, the cool kids are trying to get together and put Murmur Twins in the next karaoke revolution.
10364485	10365166	Here's my advice.
10365366	10365566	What?
10365586	10366767	Don't email Konami.
10366867	10368187	Konami doesn't read those fucking emails.
10368207	10370128	No, no, they have it on their website.
10370148	10370929	Don't you want to know?
10370949	10372570	No, they have a request on their website.
10372590	10374030	Just click here to request a song for them.
10374050	10374551	Here's the thing.
10374671	10386517	If you really want to do it, try and get a hold of ShortyNC or Shintenshi or any of those other old school Bay Area MGL guys from DDR because they all work for fucking Konami right now.
10387543	10390887	Hey, while you're working there, why don't you bug the shit out of them?
10403700	10403960	What?
10404540	10406161	It's not... I think they're trying to be funny.
10406461	10409742	I get the thing that, like, it's trying to be funny, like, ooh, teehee, let's request Murmur Twins.
10410163	10410863	It's not funny.
10411343	10417846	Wouldn't it have been, like, more funny to request Last Message or... See, yes, Last Message I think would have been a little funny.
10417866	10418826	Murmur Twins, not funny.
10419126	10421347	I'd like to request DMX be put in DDR.
10421427	10425789	I'd like to request that no Bomani songs be put in Karaoke Revolution so that we don't ruin the series.
10426129	10428270	DMX, the singer, the rapper.
10428310	10428990	No, I'm just saying.
10429150	10430871	What the fuck are you talking about?
10431791	10440076	Am I the only person who agrees that Konami's original music is better than 98% of the music that comes out nowadays?
10440236	10442878	All I'm saying is that DDR music needs to stay in DDR.
10442898	10443498	Check this shit out.
10443538	10444759	DDR music needs to stay in DDR.
10444779	10446260	It does not need to be in Karaoke Revolution.
10446280	10448361	We like Karaoke Revolution because it has the pop songs in it.
10448541	10449942	Check this out.
10450262	10452243	A new version of some Bomani game comes out.
10452303	10452764	DDR...
10453444	10458528	Poppin' Music, or 2DX, and then people go, have you heard the new license tracks?
10458548	10460049	I'm like, what, there's license tracks?
10460089	10462471	I don't give a fuck, I like Konami's music.
10462732	10463872	I like the license tracks.
10463953	10466114	Yeah, because you're a consumer whore, and how?
10466254	10466915	Fuck off.
10467896	10469837	Alright, can we actually answer the questions now?
10471058	10473760	We actually had two... Hey, could I ask a question to the chatroom first?
10474021	10474701	Yeah, why?
10474741	10479145	Could I have everyone in the chatroom place FF11 to please post what server they're on and their character name?
10479813	10480474	I'm on Bismarck.
10481315	10481855	Oh, Bismarck.
10481895	10482516	Fuck Bismarck.
10482556	10483917	Everyone jump over to Ragnarok.
10485199	10486020	Fuck Ragnarok.
10486040	10487481	There's already a game called Ragnarok.
10487882	10491446	Yeah, well, there was a... Yeah, fuck Ragnarok while we're at it.
10494128	10494749	Yes, Brad?
10495670	10495990	I don't know.
10496191	10497172	Alright, let's get to the question.
10498576	10499156	No, too late.
10499497	10503499	Same question came from both 23 Magus and Zodiac Knight.
10503559	10507922	Fuck you to the player in Star Wars Galaxy who unlocked the first Jedi.
10508283	10510104	You fucking grinding bastard.
10510144	10512005	You, like, mastered every profession in the game.
10512045	10513166	You suck ass.
10513786	10518870	And fuck you to Sony Online for making that the secret way to unlocking the goddamn Jedi character.
10518990	10519350	Jealous.
10519370	10520150	Table of one.
10520571	10520951	Jealous.
10521131	10521832	No, fuck that.
10521932	10525394	Fucking piss off because it was just about grinding profession.
10525594	10526695	It wasn't some super secret.
10526715	10527956	I thought you enjoyed grinding.
10528816	10529096	I do.
10530097	10538160	Grinding a profession is when you like just sit there and build biological chemical effectors all day long instead of actually playing the game.
10538600	10539980	You just sit there building things forever.
10540681	10546443	And it sucked because it was supposed to be some kind of cool like different way for everyone to unlock AI and it was just master of four different professions.
10550126	10551347	I don't give a shit.
10551407	10552969	I don't get a few segments done.
10554330	10557733	Same question from Magus and Zodiac Knight.
10557793	10558674	Ask the same question.
10558814	10560655	Best song in Karaoke Revolution so far?
10560695	10561116	They want to know.
10562917	10563818	Zero says none.
10564418	10564739	Loki.
10564939	10570944	Well, what my girlfriend would say would be, you're the one that I want because it was in Grease and she loves Grease.
10573712	10577773	I really don't like much of the songs, because I can't sing them, so it kind of sucks.
10578453	10588136	I mean, I like Jennifer Lopez's Waiting for Night, because that's like the only song I like of hers, and then Broken Wings is alright, because I listen to that all the time, but that's, you know.
10589256	10595698	As far as non-game music, I'd have to say Ladies Night, man.
10595738	10596738	That's awesome.
10596758	10598939	Yeah, the first unlock we got, Ladies Night.
10599039	10601960	I would say it's a close tie between Like a Virgin...
10603306	10604707	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10630816	10631777	Wait a minute, what am I talking about?
10631817	10633099	My songs are pretty faggoty too.
10633399	10637063	I'd have to say, probably, I don't know, there's three really good ones on there.
10637083	10644973	Bizarre Love Triangle, Huey Lewis and the News with Power of Love, and what was that other one I sang?
10647055	10650719	I did the Huey Lewis one, Bizarre Love Triangle was on there, and what was it?
10651581	10652701	There was another one, but yeah.
10653102	10654122	It's the End of the Worlds, we know it?
10654342	10655203	No, no.
10655623	10656623	REM isn't that great.
10657063	10657984	You just saw me do it.
10658024	10658684	Chain of Fools?
10659104	10659444	No.
10660565	10662125	Chain, chain, chain.
10662185	10662926	I don't remember the other one.
10662946	10663646	Your underwear.
10663946	10665207	I don't remember the other one you did, I'm sorry.
10667130	10668131	I don't know, but yeah, you get it.
10668311	10668811	You get the point.
10669412	10670633	There's some good songs on there.
10670673	10671873	The one from Back to the Future?
10671893	10672734	You already said that one, right?
10672754	10673234	I already said that.
10673254	10673815	Power of Love.
10673855	10674315	Power of Love.
10674335	10676316	That's great.
10676336	10678578	A couple more questions, both coming from AZM Buddy Paul.
10678598	10680759	These are the last two of the night, so no more questions for him.
10680799	10681640	I'm hijacking.
10681860	10682100	Here we go.
10682460	10683301	I'm hijacking.
10683321	10684342	Tough.
10684602	10685563	This is a live show.
10685583	10687604	We're coming to you live from the hizzle for shizzle.
10689605	10696328	DarkSakura, SuchAPiehole, AsianBuddyPaw, Have any of you had a near-death experience?
10696348	10697369	This is a pretty heavy question.
10697429	10697689	Yes.
10698550	10699210	Want to explain it?
10701351	10702852	Um, hold on.
10703512	10704313	Okay, I'll go first.
10705473	10709455	I went on a groupish date with a friend of mine.
10709535	10712777	It was this one guy and his date and my date.
10713297	10716359	And he was driving his mom's, thank God, Grand Prix.
10716939	10717760	Pontiac Grand Prix.
10717860	10718180	And, um...
10719358	10724469	It was the first, yeah, well, I say thank God because the Grand Prixs actually hold up pretty well in a wreck.
10727376	10752661	Um, we went on a date, we went to a movie, then we came home, and right after we got out of the theater, it was the first rain of a season, so in the first rain of a season, everybody starts driving like complete idiots, and since it's the first rain, there's a lot of fresh oil on the road, so we're driving, he's driving too fast for conditions, tailgating somebody, and he's looking behind him, talking to the two girls in the rear seat, whereas I'm the only one watching the street.
10753022	10755022	He's the one driving, but I'm the only one watching the street, so...
10756224	10758046	Some truck got in an accident up ahead.
10758487	10760629	They were parked in the middle of the fast lane.
10761010	10763212	And I look and I say, Oh shit, look out, stop!
10763412	10767237	And so he turns his head just in time for him to swerve to the right a little bit.
10767537	10770801	So only half of the car got hit, this truck with an iron bumper.
10771491	10772692	Thank you for watching!
10789223	10789543	DarkSakura
10815148	10818512	There was one time... Yeah, he said near death, not deaf.
10818912	10819973	Next time, pay attention.
10824659	10825539	I'm such a dick.
10825840	10827542	Loki, you had one?
10827842	10828523	Yeah, sure.
10829103	10833949	There was this one time where I came home and like...
10837241	10837742	No!
10838943	10847572	No, there was one time I came home and we were out of Captain Crunch and I thought I was going to die right there.
10853538	10855520	This one time I had to listen to Christmas Speed.
10856972	10860514	Alright, uh, other question from AZM Buddy Paul, this is pretty easily answered.
10860594	10863256	What is the song we use for the Ask Orange Lounge theme music?
10863276	10865277	We get asked this, I swear to God, every other week.
10866118	10871101	This is Journey to the Wonderland from Keyboard Mania 2nd Mix by NPB.
10872702	10876444	2nd and 3rd if you're a PlayStation 2 player, but 2nd if you're an arcade player.
10876864	10879286	Because there was an N3rd mix in the arcade, which makes me sad.
10881347	10881607	Shut up.
10882067	10882488	Alright, uh...
10884973	10886314	Let's wrap up the show now.
10886514	10888296	Let's go around and get folks' final thoughts.
10888356	10889297	Dark Child, your final thought.
10892639	10895762	www.milkycookies.com Don't worry, it's not porn.
10895802	10896643	It's actually cool stuff.
10896903	10898264	Alright, I'll take your word for it.
10898404	10899565	Why I'm going to do that, I don't know.
10899825	10901247	Brad, your final thought of the night.
10905710	10906671	I'm on TV, dammit.
10908132	10909413	Vandalist, your final thought of the evening.
10912095	10912696	Have a good night.
10913348	10915189	Okay, Bradley, your final thought of the evening.
10917932	10918432	Yay.
10919933	10921675	Zero, your final thought of the evening.
10924257	10926638	Metal Slug just ain't Metal Slug without the blood.
10928940	10932463	My final thought of the evening is MORTAL COMBAT!
10935485	10937607	And, uh, Loki, your final thought of the evening.
10940342	10942825	I had too much strawberry soda during this show.
10943246	10944608	I think I've had a whole six packs.
10944628	10946030	Does your pee smell like strawberries?
10946831	10948693	I don't know, but I'm going to smell it right now!
10952116	10957898	All right, I'm going to give the final word of the evening, one word to sum up the whole show, and we end on that note tonight.
10957998	10958938	No, Dark Child.
10959598	10961779	I give the final word of the night tonight to Vandalus.
10962439	10963479	You can't have it, Dark Child.
10963580	10964040	You don't get it.
10964460	10964980	Goat's seed.
10965060	10966120	No, no goat's seed.
10966800	10969381	Vandalus gets the last word of the evening because I know he'll keep it clean.
10970142	10971862	Vandalus, the final word of the evening tonight?
10974363	10974803	Apple pie.
10976639	10979043	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
10979484	10983391	Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
10983792	10985635	We expect you a nice play again.
10986116	10988900	And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.
10990600	10994362	Trying to save the relationship by talking about having a baby.
10994702	10996623	You know, like, that's going to work.
10997183	11000545	I had a great, great experience recently.
11000645	11003887	I helped deliver one of my best friend's children.
11003967	11009490	And, wow, when you witness something like that, you see how powerful women are.
11009650	11011571	That we bring forth life.
11011891	11012331	I mean, it's...
11013932	11014472	Awesome.
11015492	11021194	And I just was so amazed by my friend because she was not just a woman.
11021254	11022434	She was not just a mother.
11022494	11025415	At that moment, she was creation.
11025835	11027315	She was life.
11027775	11028696	She was God.
11029156	11034337	And as I looked in her eyes, her pussy exploded.
11062293	11064674	A piece of it hit me in the head!
11072799	11077462	Everybody else was like holding each other and crying and I'm like,
11090444	11094625	The nurse was running around collecting pieces of her pussy in a basket.
11101468	11102828	She's just panning for pussy.
11115272	11117353	They had to sew it back together.
11131195	11138406	Frank and Pussy It's alive!
11143694	11145798	Thanks for listening and we'll see you next week.
