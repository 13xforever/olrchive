1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk and then some.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,280
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

5
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,780
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted and mildly retarded content.

6
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,060
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,900
Yes, I will spank your child. If you're not going to do your job, God damn it, I will.

8
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,500
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

9
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,280
Thank you, F

10
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,980
Well, here's my big opening.

11
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,560
A sphincter says what?

12
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,740
I'm super. Thanks for asking.

13
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,580
Oh, you little bitch-troll from hell!

14
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,820
What am I doing here?

15
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,320
Haha!

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,820
Nooooooo!

17
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,320
Eh?

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,200
Dodge this.

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,200
Mm-hmm.

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,320
This is a tasty burger.

21
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,000
Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left!

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,040
Yes, I have!

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,920
Look!

24
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,080
It's a flesh wound.

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,040
Searching for a boy in high school is useless.

26
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,200
It's purchased for meaning in a poly-shore way.

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
Oh, yeah?

28
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,780
Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

29
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,960
Dark Sakura.

30
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,960
I had a sniff, Sky, but I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer, Loki.

31
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,960
I hate you, Orange Lounge Radio.

32
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:37,960
We are live and this is episode number 68 for November the 9th of 2003.

33
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,960
You're tuned in to the Bimani scene's most female challenge tonight,

34
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,960
Radio Station of all things Bimani.

35
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,960
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

36
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,000
And joining me as always are half of my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,600
on the farm is Jamie Summers, is all the way in that corner that's in Alabama.

38
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
She's out tonight.

39
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,200
She's on vacation.

40
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,200
So no Jamie tonight.

41
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
Sorry everybody.

42
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,680
But we have some more guests here to help kind of fill that void that Jamie has left.

43
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,680
Is this mic on?

44
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
Yes, the mic is on.

45
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,680
Hello?

46
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,680
Yes, like you said.

47
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,680
What?

48
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,680
Testing?

49
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,680
There we go, yeah.

50
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,680
on

51
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,680
the fuck up. Just kidding. Say a little likey style. You know him, probably, if you listen

52
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,680
to Vanilla Sky on Monday nights, right? Because he's always here.

53
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,680
I hope you know me. Probably just like that annoying guy who always gives us his stupid

54
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,680
opinions about how games are cool and some games aren't. That's right.

55
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,680
Also, if anything, he's cool and you all suck. Thank you. Also here tonight, say hello

56
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:13,680
to Bradley. Also known as Sarcadia32. Hi, how are you?

57
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:23,560
Well, we have someone who has never been to the show in the house before.

58
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,560
He says, join us for some of our live remotes, but never in the house.

59
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,360
Say hello to Vanders!

60
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
Mahalo!

61
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
How are you?

62
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,560
I am well, thank you.

63
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,280
That's good, I'm glad you could make it.

64
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,160
Thanks, I'm glad to be here.

65
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
This is exciting!

66
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,600
Our home base is exactly what I thought it would be.

67
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Lots of anime, lots of DVDs, lots of games.

68
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,200
Soundtrack for our breaks because I know you guys have been wanting to hear some of the new stuff

69
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:23,480
During this break. We're gonna hear a brand new mr. T song doing the goonies are good enough. This is awesome

70
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:31,260
Shut it is awesome. You're outvoted Loki also in this break. We're gonna hear an artist called Noki Noki. Oh with a song called

71
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,780
pata pata mama

72
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,220
pata pata mama is the name of the song we're gonna hear second and then also in this break we're gonna hear a really cool remix of

73
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,220
Oh

74
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,220
Ba-da-ba-da

75
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,220
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da

76
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,220
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da

77
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,220
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-da

78
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,220
Yo, Kuji

79
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,220
Amado ba-da-ba-da

80
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,220
U-da-da-i-na

81
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,220
Kichi-ji

82
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,220
O-na-re-ke-do-ke-do-da-i-do-koro

83
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,220
Hachi-ji

84
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,220
La-ba-lo-ki

85
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,220
U-o-me-ka-me-ka-ku-su-me-ga-ki

86
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,220
Ku-ji

87
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:49,220
You didn't have to believe in how you were dead

88
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,220
Let it stop, let it stop, let it stop

89
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,220
It might be still what it could be

90
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,220
For you I thought that there's been an open

91
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,220
If you wanted to live in a higher world

92
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,220
You'd be the one that you wanted to be

93
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,220
But at least I'm doing what I can tonight

94
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,720
To watch it when it starts

95
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,220
So I don't mind that it has got to

96
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,720
To do the best that I can

97
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,720
Do okay

98
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Do what I can

99
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,720
I'm not getting out of here

100
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,220
You turned away

101
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,720
You're gonna see me

102
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,220
And I won't let it in

103
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,720
And if it isn't that I didn't even know you were falling in love

104
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:43,220
I'm believing that you're missing me while you're standing with me alone

105
00:09:43,220 --> 00:10:11,220
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

106
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,220
No!

107
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,220
Do we show what people think of us?

108
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,220
No!

109
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,220
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

110
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,220
Yes!

111
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:32,620
Extreme Bimani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

112
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:37,620
Hello and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio and that was some music from the new Popin

113
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,620
Music Part 10.

114
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,620
I can't believe that game has gotten that high, all the way to 10.

115
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,620
That's more than I think any other Romani game has gotten yet.

116
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,620
What is it about popin' music that makes it so damn popular?

117
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,620
Any thoughts?

118
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,620
Retards like to smash their heads against round buttons.

119
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,620
Find a mic.

120
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,620
Yeah, get a microphone.

121
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,620
Look, you've already said it.

122
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,620
Come on, say it again.

123
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,620
Because retards like smashing their heads into large round buttons.

124
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,620
I'm not quite sure why it's so popular.

125
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:13,140
I guess maybe just the music is more popular over there than say 2DX's music seems to be

126
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,180
more popular over here, from what my little sphere of influence.

127
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:21,600
I personally, I don't know, since there's so much music in pop music, since there's

128
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,060
ten versions now, plus the anime little ones, yeah there's a lot of good tracks, but overall

129
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:31,700
I think the majority of the music isn't my style, whereas 2DX is more my type of thing,

130
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,100
more of a dancey, techno, trancey...

131
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,500
You and your rectangular buttons.

132
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Yeah, I know, not the big round tap light ones.

133
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,100
Instead I've got little tiny like keys, you know.

134
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,100
Well, your game doesn't have any characters dancing around.

135
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,300
Well, in some of the videos it does.

136
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,700
Ha! Some!

137
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,300
Or as I have all of them.

138
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,900
I think that's probably one of the points right there,

139
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,600
the pop music thing.

140
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,500
It's so marketable.

141
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
I mean, there's hundreds of characters,

142
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,500
for almost every single song ever made on it, and there's like 500 plus songs probably

143
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,500
all made.

144
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,920
I don't know, it's crazy.

145
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,180
I was just looking at, Naby was over at a little gathering we were having last night,

146
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:19,340
and Naby, who's been on the show before, he's kind of known as the local Papa Music whore,

147
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,260
and he buys everything really into Papa Music.

148
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,260
He bought this new Papa Music calendar.

149
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,500
Okay, this new calendar is like the size of a small poster.

150
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,660
It's not the size of your typical calendar, it's bigger.

151
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,000
It's like the size of a small poster.

152
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,640
a huge W.A.B. poster, but like a fold-out poster type thing. It's pretty big. And the

153
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,280
cover of it has every single character from pop and music, and it's like looking at a

154
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,040
Where's Waldo picture. Honestly, there's so many people just packed in there. It's kind

155
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,720
of like, I want to find this one. I want to find the girl that looks like she's flicking

156
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,760
her clit in that one song. And I'm looking, and it's like playing Where's Waldo. There's

157
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,440
so damn many characters. And yes, I swear to God, there is a girl that looks like she's

158
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,520
flicking her clit in one song. Just wanted to share.

159
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:04,520
No, it's more like she's smoking out of her pussy. She keeps going like this. You know how people smoke? I'm doing the sign with the two fingers out like a peace sign. They're smoking.

160
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:11,520
Except she's doing it from her, you know, under her skirt area, if you can imagine that. You on the radio side.

161
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:21,520
The best, though, is the character Liddell, who is in, I believe it's pop music, 8? I think it's 7 or 8. I can't remember. But it's a song called Galaxy Forest. I think it's 8, too.

162
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,840
No, you know what, I think it's seven because I think I've known of Liddell for a while.

163
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,360
Okay, so I think it's one of the consumer tracks from seven is Galaxy Forest and there's

164
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,420
this chick Liddell who looks like a sheep herder but with no face and just two little

165
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,220
lighting eyes, so kind of like a black mage, like if you imagine Vivi, right?

166
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:43,480
It's like Vivi is a sheep herder but a girl and she wears a skirt but if she loses, like

167
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,140
rats fly out of her cooch.

168
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,780
Like these rats drop from her skirt and scurry off.

169
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:56,720
really disturbing like pop music has a lot of very disturbing trends of it like

170
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:03,220
Donatello Versace that one part I can't stop you know bats flying out of my

171
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:08,020
couch you're thinking that one Saturday Night Live with Donatello Versace in the

172
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:14,040
backlight yes it was just like that okay it's time to end the show but I draw the

173
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,040
with a line of bats flying out of my coach.

174
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,040
Anyway, sorry.

175
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,040
So I thought maybe we could go through these songs

176
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,040
we just played and see what you guys think of them.

177
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,040
We haven't really ever done that with new songs,

178
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,040
but you know, we're desperate for material tonight.

179
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,040
So let's see, what do you guys think of Mr. T

180
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,040
with Goonies Are Good Enough?

181
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:37,040
Crap!

182
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,040
Crap, crap, crap, crap.

183
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
You think this is crap?

184
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,040
It is crap. You're crap.

185
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,040
Let me just play some MIDI for you.

186
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,040
We don't even do anything with it, we just play MIDI.

187
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,040
Crap.

188
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,040
Okay.

189
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,040
That's your opinion.

190
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,040
This song brings me back to my days when I was a little kid

191
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,040
and used to play Gooey's 2 on Nintendo.

192
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,040
Oh, it's awesome. I've always liked Mr. T,

193
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,040
but he's been bringing out some cool stuff ever since, like,

194
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,040
I don't know, Burning Heat and stuff like that.

195
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:16,040
So good stuff. It just reminds me of like kind of like a kiriyama oka's feel of his little 8-bit sounding music and stuff

196
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,020
I have a question for Loki. Do you consider this crap?

197
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,600
Yes

198
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,800
Wait a minute. You like this song. I've seen you play it before

199
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,660
Yeah, like once ass you don't like that song

200
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,860
song? So many Goonies are good enough, it's kind of like the next chapter. That song right

201
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:43,020
there, that has actual synthesizers and stuff, and it actually looks like, you know, they

202
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:48,380
spent more than two minutes on it, okay? Whereas the Goonies song is just like, oh, let's play

203
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:53,700
it straight up Nintendo. And no, it wasn't hard for him to do that, all he did was just

204
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,820
throw it into a MIDI player and go. Okay, here's my next question, what do you think

205
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:04,820
of this

206
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
you gotta keep it

207
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,000
keep it with those faggots

208
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:23,720
well if you're gonna play a faggoty song anyways, at least play it so it sounds like a faggoty song instead of a faggoty 8-bit shit

209
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,860
the opinions and

210
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,580
But whatever, Loki, do not. Yeah, you get it.

211
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:35,740
No, I don't care. I'm gay and I think it's funny.

212
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,420
We all know Loki's tight with the queers.

213
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,380
Last time we asked is queers. No, I love my goonies, okay?

214
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,940
He's friendly

215
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,740
with the queers. I love goonies. That movie rocks.

216
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,860
And to totally take that song and just take a huge dump on it, it's just awful.

217
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,580
Okay, but doesn't that song, isn't it even remotely retro to you?

218
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,540
Didn't you ever play The Goonies 2 on Nintendo?

219
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,860
No, it doesn't exist.

220
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,860
For those that are-

221
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,860
She turned into a fucking mermaid!

222
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,340
Come on, it does not exist!

223
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:11,180
For those that, um, I've read online that people think that that song is The Goonies

224
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,940
2 song just lifted from the game.

225
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:17,060
Okay, I hate to break it to you, but 8-Bit sounded a lot worse than that, so that has

226
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,060
been redone.

227
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,740
Now, to me, not enough in my opinion.

228
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,740
Shut up.

229
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:28,080
song is to Goonies 2, like Burning Heat was to Gradius 2. To me, that's just kind of the

230
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,500
next chapter of the Burning Heat. It's taken another old school Konami theme and redoing

231
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:37,680
it. So let's all hope to God that next Mr. T tackles Castlevania 2, because I would poop

232
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,680
my pants.

233
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:44,180
Oh my God. Here's the thing I've always been pissed off about. Akumaju Dracula immediately

234
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:50,800
from, what is it, Keyboard Mania 2nd, is like already perfectly suited for Guitar Freaks

235
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,800
and it never showed up.

236
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:59,800
It's got the, you know, come on man, more Castlevania music in Bimani games, please.

237
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,800
Or Gradius, or Goonies.

238
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,800
Gradius was cool, the music in Gradius was cool.

239
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,800
You know what, that's one thing I have to say I really like about Konami

240
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
and that's one reason they're so well suited for DDR

241
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,800
is that their music, typically, is pretty kick-ass.

242
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,800
It's all classic, you know, I can, you can name off, like, any old Konami game

243
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:29,800
and it's always got good music, even like, uh, what was that, uh, Roller Games, stupid rollerblading or, you know, roller derby type game that they made.

244
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:36,800
Or yeah, Resh Attack or Metal Gear The Original, they always had pretty good music for like the hardware that they were putting it on.

245
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:43,800
And yeah, Gradius' music was cool, even the 2DX songs are very good and stuff, but I want Castlevania music.

246
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,800
And if you haven't played it yet, go play the new Castlevania, good stuff, get the soundtrack, it's awesome.

247
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,800
Do they actually have a CD soundtrack for that?

248
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,800
Uh, Japan will, we won't.

249
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Um, the game came out here in America first, and they're gonna release it over there like a month later,

250
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:04,800
with a CD soundtrack and like tons of frickin collectibles and stuff, cause we don't get that cool stuff over here.

251
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,800
Damn you, Konami of America.

252
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,800
Yeah, here.

253
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,800
We stupid Americans. We not good enough for collector edition.

254
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,920
Let's go to the next song. This is um, I had to play this just because of the name alone

255
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,680
This is a song called pata pata mama. This is the next song we played on that break

256
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,520
What do you think of this one

257
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,560
What do you think of this one now, we know why those school girls jumped in front of the train

258
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:11,280
that bad huh? I think it's cute in a pop music way and only a way that pop music music can

259
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,280
be that song is cute

260
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:17,180
pop music belongs in the twilight zone because seriously it has like the worst music ever

261
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,000
and then yet they keep releasing more sequels for it

262
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:30,000
MURMUR TWINS

263
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
the other one was. Yeah, I don't even know what the other one was. Screw that. But yeah,

264
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,000
this is good. DJW is awesome. Murmur Twins, Spica, all the Linus, all the cool stuff he's

265
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,780
done. Murmur Twins has probably always been my favorite of his, so this is pretty cool

266
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:13,540
that they actually remixed it and such. Just don't do a trance remix of it ever, please.

267
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,400
I imagine that'll probably fit in the next 2DX, because remember how Night Style was

268
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,520
just like remix hell like everything was just remixed and the shit out of it in

269
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:28,960
night style well I don't know I think DJ W's little forte is using kind of like

270
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,040
keyboards and piano a lot almost like in a song of Kubota ish but not this

271
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,640
classical sounding and so I don't think they would do like a trancy version

272
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,600
really it would I don't know then again moon child is kind of different from his

273
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:48,600
other stuff, so whatever.

274
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:19,960
You know what, actually my mom and dad were going to give me an old car of theirs too

275
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,160
when I got my license, only we had a big flood and it drowned.

276
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,160
It drowned.

277
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,160
The car drowned.

278
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,160
Oh.

279
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,280
Yeah, so I'm just bitter.

280
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,280
Don't listen to me.

281
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,920
Maybe you shouldn't have living cars anymore then.

282
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:39,000
No, my car, it died and when you turn the key in it won't start anymore because there's

283
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,200
mud everywhere.

284
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:48,580
You shouldn't drive the car into the river again then.

285
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,860
I did not drive the car into the river.

286
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:59,320
My dad parked it near a creek, which is typical because there is a parking lot next to the

287
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,320
creek.

288
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,320
What do you do in the parking lot?

289
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,320
You park your car.

290
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,320
That's what he did.

291
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,700
No, he did not park his car in the creek.

292
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,860
He parked his car next to the creek and then it rained like what?

293
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,140
eight inches in twenty four hours or something fucking crazy

294
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,460
no this was in nineteen ninety five when california had those huge floods like

295
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,300
president clinton came out here and everything

296
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,620
and the car just floated away

297
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:23,860
too bad the floods didn't sweep him away

298
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,780
i cried but my car now is cool

299
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,940
actually the the car was supposed to have was a ford explorer

300
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,840
it was a ninety two ford explorer

301
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,560
and my friend my friends and i always called it the jurassic park car because it was the same car

302
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,440
they used in jurassic park and

303
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,440
You know, we always used to get in the car and go...

304
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,440
I know, we were dorks. What can I say?

305
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,440
No, actually, it never got old.

306
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,440
Kill yourself now. Awful.

307
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,440
I hope a dinosaur eats you while you're on the crapper.

308
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,440
Oh, Jurassic Park 4 was awesome.

309
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,440
There was no Jurassic Park 4, yet.

310
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,440
Yeah, there was no Jurassic Park board.

311
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,440
That's what's so great about it.

312
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,440
Yeah.

313
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,440
They're making one so far.

314
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,440
I know, I know.

315
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,440
But I do, I miss my car.

316
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,440
You know, whenever I think about my car, I get all nostalgic.

317
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:29,440
Why do you have this?

318
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:36,440
Are you a closet Jurassic Park fan? Do you like dinosaurs? Pink dinosaurs?

319
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,440
No, I just happen to like John Williams.

320
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,440
Welcome to ten years ago.

321
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,440
I happen to like John Williams, is that so wrong?

322
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,440
I reorganized my MP3 collection not too long ago.

323
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,440
That's right, John Williams is one of the greatest composers ever.

324
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,440
They are really making a Jurassic Park 4 though, you do know.

325
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,440
You do know this, because Jurassic Park 3 did really, really well.

326
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,440
So, of course, there will be a Jurassic Park 4.

327
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:07,640
did well, I didn't know anybody who saw it. Really. I would only see it because William

328
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:15,760
H. Macy is in it, that's all. What the hell? What is this showing? What is that? Are they

329
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,060
See raccoons?

330
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:29,980
Hold on, get this on the mic.

331
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,320
Is this Satan worshipping?

332
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,440
This is weird, it sounds like Silent Hill music.

333
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,780
Excuse me.

334
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,740
I'm dying.

335
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,740
Too much nostalgia is bad for me.

336
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:47,980
Anyway, why don't you post a link to that badger thing in the chat room, so if they...

337
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,980
Oh, did they get...

338
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,980
Oh, okay.

339
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,980
Oh, somebody else put it in there.

340
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,980
I see.

341
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,980
I see.

342
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,980
Okay.

343
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,980
Oh, I see what happened.

344
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,980
It's all Wampa's fault.

345
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,980
I get it.

346
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,980
All right.

347
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,940
Do the badgers ever do anything other than just stand there and dance?

348
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,940
No, they just badger.

349
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,940
Oh, they just badger.

350
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,940
That's cute.

351
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,940
That's cute.

352
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,940
Random snake.

353
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,940
Random snake.

354
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,940
That's good.

355
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,940
Random Snake.

356
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,940
That's good.

357
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,940
Okay.

358
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:16,300
Now this is a part of the show where we usually like to kick off the show with this, but you

359
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,300
know, we're a little late tonight.

360
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,300
Oh, well.

361
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,860
I thought we'd play a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.

362
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:25,100
This is the part of the show where we go around and ask everybody, how was your week, how

363
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,660
was your day, Loki?

364
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:37,120
How was your week, how was your day?

365
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:43,400
I think that mic is off, Logie.

366
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:49,640
I think you're disconnected then, because I'm not hearing it.

367
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,840
Damn you. There we go. All right. How was your week? How was your day, Logie?

368
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,160
I had bacon grease in my hands.

369
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,400
Anyways, um...

370
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,360
Let's see. The only thing worth mentioning this week is I went and saw Matrix Revolutions.

371
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,320
It was okay. It was good.

372
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,360
And I went and saw Elf yesterday.

373
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,720
That was good.

374
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,240
And it looks like a movie that's going to be really manipulative,

375
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:14,760
though.

376
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,240
It's going to have one of those crybaby endings, and like,

377
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,480
family, feel good, family fun.

378
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,240
OK.

379
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,440
I don't know what it is with people making Christmas movies

380
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,360
and thinking that at the end of every Christmas movie

381
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,240
has to be, for some reason, you have to get the Christmas spirit

382
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,800
and then everything is message.

383
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,080
It's like, the whole movie was good until they threw out, like,

384
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:41,080
Oh, everyone must believe in Santa or else Christmas will not be saved!

385
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,160
You know, it's just so awful that they do stuff like that, but the rest of the movie

386
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,160
is awesome.

387
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,680
Yeah, why don't they make movies about real life, you know, like some people don't get

388
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,600
to have Christmas because they're so poor and they don't get to eat like once a week

389
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,080
and stuff, and you know, that's a nice uplifting Christmas story.

390
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,080
I like it, they had a part in it.

391
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,080
Okay, what about the Jews?

392
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,080
I don't know.

393
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,080
We'll go see the movie.

394
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,080
They had a part in the movie, though, where he's talking to Santa.

395
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,080
He's like, there's been rumors going around

396
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,080
that parents are telling their children,

397
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,080
or that people are believing that their parents are putting

398
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,080
the presents under the tree, and they're all,

399
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,080
how is that possible?

400
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,080
How would they even be able to do that in one night?

401
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,080
He's like, I know.

402
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,080
And they're all, then what about the cookies?

403
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,080
Do they think that they eat the cookies, too?

404
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,080
I guess so.

405
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,080
They just said it so sarcastically, it was funny.

406
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,140
Because there was no Santa Claus!

407
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,300
Thank you, thank you, Loki, ruining Christmas everywhere.

408
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:44,220
I'm not gonna go and let my kids believe that there's this fake Santa Claus or Easter Bunny.

409
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:48,140
I'm gonna let them, I'm gonna make it a little more realistic for them.

410
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:51,660
That mom and dad have to take out another loan on the house because you want your fucking

411
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,460
presents you little brats.

412
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:58,060
This is a fun little side topic, I want to pose this question to everybody in here.

413
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:03,060
How old were you when you found out there was no Santa Claus, and how did you react?

414
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:07,060
Loki, how old were you when you found out there was no Santa Claus and how did you react?

415
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:12,060
Oh damn, I don't even remember. I just don't think I cared, so I was getting presents anyways.

416
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,060
But, um, I don't know.

417
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,060
Alright, bad.

418
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:22,820
I think it was like four or five, you know, as far as I can remember, and I reacted pretty

419
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,820
well.

420
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:29,380
I was like, oh, cool, a new four-in-a-row hidden in my mom's closet.

421
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,380
So I took it pretty well.

422
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,380
Vandalous?

423
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,140
What are you guys talking about?

424
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,140
There's no Santa Claus.

425
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,140
What are you talking about, man?

426
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:42,140
I know it's like a big joke, isn't it?

427
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,380
Yeah, it's a joke.

428
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,380
That's what we do on the radio.

429
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,380
We kid.

430
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,380
I kid.

431
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,520
Anyways, I actually found out because my parents told me they got tired of trying to play it

432
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,840
off like there was, and so they said, hey, you know what, we just put the presents under

433
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,840
the tree for you.

434
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,400
So I'm kind of jaded about that kind of thing.

435
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,900
So that's why my kids don't think there's a Santa Claus either, because that's all kind

436
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,920
of, he's a silly little red elf.

437
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:08,960
I was about to say, since you actually have kids who are the age where they could, they're

438
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,560
not babies, they're toddlers now, and they're thinking about Santa Claus and all that, did

439
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,040
you try the Santa Claus thing with him or did you just say, screw it, you know what

440
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:21,280
kids, I'm going to tell you a secret, the other kids are going to try to feed you the

441
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,280
Santa crap?

442
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:27,680
That's pretty essentially it, we told them, you know, he's a funny little elf, who just,

443
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:33,080
people look like him at the malls, he doesn't do anything for you, and we just go ahead

444
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,760
and let them know we give him the presents and things like that.

445
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,040
Same with the Easter Bunny, same with the Tooth Fairy.

446
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:46,040
All he does is beg for money to give to the Red Cross, that greedy bastard.

447
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:50,080
Will, I know you're the youngest one here, but the news has been broken, yes?

448
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,080
I'm just kidding.

449
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,080
I'm kidding.

450
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,080
Of course.

451
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,080
How old were you and how did you react?

452
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,080
I don't know.

453
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,920
I was probably like nine or ten.

454
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,920
I can't really remember.

455
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,480
Oh, presents.

456
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:06,400
You didn't care because you were still getting presents?

457
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,400
Yeah.

458
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,400
It wasn't a huge shock.

459
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:13,400
I mean, by that age it's not very believable anymore, anyways.

460
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,400
I see.

461
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,400
The logistics of it just is what clued me in on it.

462
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:23,400
I'm like, how can a fat fuck fit down this goddamn chimney anyways?

463
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,400
Oh, he uses his magic powers.

464
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,400
Oh, yeah, magic powers.

465
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,400
Isn't that convenient?

466
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,400
All right, Bradley, want to share?

467
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,400
I don't really remember.

468
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,400
It was probably around five or six, maybe.

469
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:41,160
My sister told me and I said, oh, okay.

470
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,200
I don't think I was really shocked.

471
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,880
That sounds very like you, Bradley, where you just would have been, oh, okay.

472
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,120
I'm kind of surprised by that.

473
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:55,480
You didn't become emotional?

474
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,880
I was five years old when I found out because my mom just started putting the presents under

475
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,440
the tree that said, from Santa, under the tree on the 23rd because she was just getting

476
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,080
lazy and she didn't want to play the game anymore.

477
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,200
I was kind of like, why does Santa and you

478
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,240
have the same handwriting?

479
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,560
And she'd just ignore me.

480
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,960
How come the presents are under the tray on the 23rd?

481
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,400
How come the cookies are still gone

482
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,080
and we have to leave them out on the 24th?

483
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,880
How come the reindeer hooves look just like the rabbit hooves?

484
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,760
Because I was totally that kind of kid,

485
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,960
where whenever anybody would try to tell me something,

486
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,200
I'd be all, why, why, why?

487
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,800
I was that annoying little shit.

488
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,640
One note I did.

489
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,760
Why?

490
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,480
I was real into spying and all that cool shit.

491
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:42,240
So what I had is I had ultraviolet pens, and I marked all the packages that were hidden

492
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,240
in the closet to prove or not if they were from Santa or whatever, because they weren't

493
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,760
marked who they were for or who they were from, so you get the from Santa ones and you

494
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,560
take my little ultraviolet light and you're like, HA!

495
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,560
HA!

496
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,560
You tried to trick me?

497
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,560
Ah, you saw right through it.

498
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,560
Low-key, ever-the-conspiracy-theorist.

499
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,820
Oh my God.

500
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:10,440
My parents used to leave the tags on the presents because they wanted to be able to return them.

501
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,320
When I saw that Santa Claus shopped at the commissary on base, wow, he really saved some

502
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,320
money doing that.

503
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,780
I thought he made them.

504
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:20,040
That's a nice revelation there.

505
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,040
Santa's military.

506
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,040
I didn't know that.

507
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,680
What a nice sweater from Santa.

508
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,780
I didn't know Santa's workshop was called Mervin's.

509
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:36,660
kostjamrh And why isn't Santa contributing to the US economy? If he's using all this

510
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:42,860
elf labor and stuff, do they have unions? Because he's making a lot of knock-off goods and stuff

511
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,140
and selling them, calling them name-brand.

512
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:52,140
p0k3smot42o you can't find a fucking place to park at the north pole on a saturday

513
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,140
Thanks to piracy!

514
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:23,220
Thanks to piracy, because all those methods that they put watermarking the god damn film

515
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:28,220
and checking people's bags and stuff, you can see it's totally put a stop to piracy.

516
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,160
You know what, it's one of those things where I wanted to try it before I buy it, and I

517
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:35,420
tried it, and I've decided, you know what, I think I'll just watch the other half at

518
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,420
home.

519
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:41,820
You know, here's what it is, it's like, I'm sorry, I don't want to go to the theater and

520
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:48,120
pay $18 every time I go see a movie. I'm going to watch it once in the theater, so I remember.

521
00:34:48,120 --> 00:35:01,300
You pay for your date? Yeah. Wow. You guys are going to hell. You're stealing from people

522
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:06,920
who work hard to give you this stuff and you're just like, stealing it. You know what, I saw

523
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,120
Kill Bill three times in the theater to make up for it, so... But that place is not going

524
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:18,120
to the Wachowski Brothers, or Warner Brothers Entertainment for Warner Brothers.

525
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:24,000
They've made almost $1 billion on the franchise. They can go to hell. I don't really care.

526
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
And they spent about $1 billion making the second and third movies.

527
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,880
Think of all the starving children that could have fed.

528
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,940
yeah like Keanu Reeves

529
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,820
yeah I think of all the acting classes he could have gone into his own

530
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,120
oh that's funny

531
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:46,080
well if anything I want to see the Wachowski brothers take on Bill and Ted three

532
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,080
okay

533
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,380
that's what they need to make

534
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,020
that's all that he's good at

535
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:53,880
just bring it back, bring it back to old school

536
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,560
yeah seriously just have it like

537
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,440
Bill and Ted do something you know

538
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,760
three

539
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,600
but anyways um...

540
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:07,460
So what else did I do? Oh, I made two more remixes. The only one was tonight. And I did

541
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:14,500
a live show last night, an impromptu livewire show at like one in the morning. And that

542
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:19,980
was cool because I was bored. And I took the chat room and then thinking I was a person

543
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,320
called Death By Syrup from Canada.

544
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,460
And they should have known right there that that was your super bacon right there. Because

545
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,300
that was the bacon you made tonight, right?

546
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:34,220
No, well, I got the syrup idea from seeing Elf because he, like, would drink syrup, so...

547
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:38,980
No, that's good. Syrup shots, man, I want to do some of those.

548
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:44,340
Oh my God, we did that at, um, in LA. Yeah, we went to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.

549
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:48,220
It was right after Cyber Zone, the big tournament there. A bunch of us went over to Roscoe's

550
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:53,420
Chicken and Waffle, and, uh, it was like, what, me, Brad, Irene, Mel B, who else was

551
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:57,100
at our table? Tons of, uh, Bay Area people. But it was mostly our table that did the syrup

552
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:07,460
You, me, Irene, Fury, Wendell, Mandy, they give you these little shot glasses full of

553
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:11,660
syrup and warm syrup to put on your waffles and chicken.

554
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,340
Nice warm gooey bottle of soup.

555
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:17,900
The thing is, since it's warm, if you've ever cooked soup or something that's thick, when

556
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:22,240
you're heating it up, it starts to create a film on top, like it's kind of hard.

557
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,780
That's what happened to this syrup, so you had the nice little, it's almost like a tequila

558
00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:02,780
a Loki so he can finish telling us about his weakness day.

559
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:32,780
in

560
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,420
yeah

561
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,500
that's it i'm done

562
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,740
all right uh... i guess i'll ask brad since you know he kept putting in on

563
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:43,100
that last one how are you how's your day you already know

564
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:46,860
but listeners don't like they care okman

565
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:50,900
i went out and last week i believe it was one hour and

566
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,740
use my wonderful city critic card and bought

567
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:57,740
a PS2, an American one, because I haven't had one for the longest time, I only had a Japanese one.

568
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:03,740
So I got that, and Castlevania, because I was fiending, I had to finish Castlevania, because I've been bumming it off of you guys here.

569
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,740
I want to loan it to me.

570
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:08,740
That's alright, I had to buy it. Matt's saying he'd loan it to me, but that's fine.

571
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:16,740
So I bought it, and finished it up, I beat it pretty much every different way you can, except for crazy mode, because it's crazy and whatnot.

572
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:27,740
I beat it with the two hidden characters, like four hours is all it took me to beat it with the second hidden character, and three hours is all it took me for the first hidden character. You can go through it so freaking fast.

573
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:36,740
Anyhow, so, got that. I've got a job interview tomorrow, so I will have a life for once! Finally! Yay for me!

574
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,740
Congratulations.

575
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,880
Yeah, I'm gonna work for the man, so

576
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,040
And that's pretty much it we had

577
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,080
friend over from

578
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:54,960
Old-school friend over for you know the weekend and watched movies and and you got the strangers with candy DVDs, so we watched that

579
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,720
You know oh my god

580
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,920
Please I this is my highest recommendation

581
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:06,440
I could ever give a DVD go out and buy the strangers with candy season 1 and season 2 box sets

582
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,440
I almost peed my pants at that episode we watched last night.

583
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,440
Oh my god, that was one of the most disturbing things I've done before.

584
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,440
It was the most morbid thing I think I've ever seen on a broadcast television show.

585
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,440
Well, it's cable, whatever, basic cable.

586
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,440
But still.

587
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,440
It was great. It was great.

588
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:25,440
I don't even want to describe it because I don't want to ruin it, but one of the funniest shows I've ever seen.

589
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,440
Strainers of Candy. Go buy the first episode.

590
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,440
We'll watch it after tonight's show. We'll watch that episode because it's just great.

591
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:36,680
I had to go to the bathroom from laughing so hard after the ending of that one.

592
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:41,200
Yeah, it was like two or three in the morning, and you're like waking up our neighbor.

593
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,600
I have an infectious laugh, what can I say?

594
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,760
Eddie was pretty loud too when he laughed, though.

595
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,760
I love Eddie's laugh.

596
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,760
I'm sure we'll talk about this later.

597
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,240
I wish Eddie was here tonight so I can make him laugh so you guys could hear, because

598
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,240
I love his laugh.

599
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,440
I'm sure we'll talk about this later, but we also sang karaoke.

600
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,440
Yeah, we'll get to that.

601
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,440
We'll get to that.

602
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,440
Yeah, well, that's a good topic right there.

603
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,440
Next, next segment, we'll get to that.

604
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,440
Yes.

605
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,440
I'm awful.

606
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,440
So am I, but anyway.

607
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,440
Okay.

608
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,440
Anything else you want to say about your weekend weekend?

609
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,440
Um, I started playing Final Fantasy X because I am way freaking behind.

610
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,440
All you people who have played it already, good for you.

611
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,440
So.

612
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,440
I, I quit.

613
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,440
Final Fantasy XI's taken over.

614
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,440
I can't go back to Final Fantasy X now.

615
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,440
Yeah.

616
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,440
Hey, if I had Final Fantasy XI, I'd be playing that too, so.

617
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,440
But I don't, because I've got no money, so I'll just play Final Fantasy X.

618
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:36,720
10 until I beat it. Good stuff. And then I got to pick Kingdom Hearts, because I'm way

619
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,720
behind on that too.

620
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,160
Remind me, I've got to give that to you before you go.

621
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,160
Yes, give it to me.

622
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,160
Give it to me now!

623
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,160
Give it to me in the butt.

624
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,160
Ew.

625
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,160
Anyway.

626
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,160
Okay.

627
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,040
Stick your keyblade in my butt.

628
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:52,920
Anyway, is that it?

629
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,800
What else happened? Did we do anything else?

630
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,080
Not that I remember. I mean, we didn't do Vanilla Sky this week. We took a week off

631
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:04,880
of vanilla sky and by the way on a rerun of vanilla sky had our highest listener count

632
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,340
ever on the show and it wasn't even on the right night that's why i know jamie's show

633
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:13,600
whoops mine in the ratings because we moved to tuesday for a night through the roof there's

634
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:18,560
a little ego stroking for jamie yeah jamie if you're out there listening wait is somebody

635
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:24,280
asking me um if i'm gonna play x2 or is somebody asking somebody else um well let's let's pretend

636
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:28,680
they're asking you that you want to play phone se x2 i was not interested at all when i saw

637
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,760
I saw this, I was like, what the hell, let's just make the three main characters girls

638
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,080
that dress weirdly and stuff.

639
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,200
But after reading about it and how they're going to have a job system and stuff like

640
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,520
that, it sounds interesting.

641
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,520
I still, since I haven't gone through Final Fantasy X yet, I don't understand what the

642
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,000
connection is, but I noticed a lot of the characters are missing from Final Fantasy

643
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
X.

644
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,360
Yeah, and they can kiss my bad ass for not having Lulu a playable character.

645
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,760
Well Lulu's going to be in it, but she's not a playable character.

646
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,760
Fuck that.

647
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,280
What I'm pissed off is, where's Oren?

648
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,780
And don't say, I know people are probably going to sit there in the chat room and spoil

649
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,780
it for me, because you guys all suck.

650
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:07,440
Yeah, remember, Brad and I have not beat Final Fantasy X yet, I've picked up on some things

651
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,480
that might be happening, but let's not spoil, okay?

652
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,480
I don't know.

653
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,200
So I will play it, if you were asking me.

654
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,160
If you weren't asking me, I don't fucking care.

655
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,160
Fuck you.

656
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,160
I'll tell you my opinion anyway.

657
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,160
Sorry.

658
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,840
I'm really not this angsty and all that, but it's okay.

659
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,840
No, you are.

660
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,840
Fuck you!

661
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,840
See?

662
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,840
Please.

663
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:35,840
Alright, Will, how you doing? Slinky wizard? Are you still slinky wizard, or just slinky

664
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,840
now?

665
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,840
Whatever.

666
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:42,840
Such an apathetic little teen you are, go ahead.

667
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,840
I don't care anymore, it doesn't matter.

668
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,840
Will, how was your week, how was your day?

669
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:53,840
Well, high school. Yeah, high school is high school, and high school sucks.

670
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:59,760
And, you know, on Tuesday I got my license, barely.

671
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,760
Missed 11.

672
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,760
Oh yeah.

673
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,880
Hey, what score is that, 89?

674
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,720
I think the most you miss is like 13 or 15.

675
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,720
Oh.

676
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,720
Yeah.

677
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,720
Wait, on the written test?

678
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,240
The driving test.

679
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,240
Really?

680
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,240
God.

681
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,640
You used to be able to get a 70 and still pass because I got an 80.

682
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,640
Yeah.

683
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,140
They're evil.

684
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,980
I got a B- in driving.

685
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,660
I got like a 70.

686
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,140
I got like the lowest you can get.

687
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,820
Here's what happened.

688
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,500
I got a, let's see how we did this.

689
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,780
I got knocked off probably four points.

690
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:38,180
I probably would have had like a 90-something.

691
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,700
And I finished the entire test, and I parked.

692
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:41,660
And I parked like shit.

693
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:43,060
I parked all crooked and stuff.

694
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:44,520
And I didn't take any points off that.

695
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,820
And we're right about to go inside and get my license,

696
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,620
because I got like a 90-something percent.

697
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:51,380
And he's like, actually, you didn't move your head enough.

698
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,380
and then knocks off like 20 points. I was like...

699
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:57,380
Was he just mad because you weren't moving your head up and down his crotch?

700
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:00,380
I wasn't moving my head like this, and this is only for the people in the studio because

701
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,380
you guys, you know, over there can't hear it.

702
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,380
You can kind of see on the cam.

703
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:07,380
But I was moving my head like this because you have to look, you know, you have to look

704
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:11,380
down a street when you drive through an intersection, you need to look down both sides. I was moving

705
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:18,380
my head like this. He wanted me to move my head like this. You know, apparently, and...

706
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,380
Did you take it at Florin or something?

707
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:22,380
Did you take it at Lauren Mall?

708
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:27,380
weekend, and trying to cause trouble, and stuff like that. So, fun stuff.

709
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,380
Alright. That's about it.

710
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,380
Alright, cool deal. Have you played AMDDR at all lately?

711
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:41,380
I know I haven't. No, actually, no. We went on Thursday, and I did play two games. I'm

712
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:45,380
working on my doubles. For some reason, I'm in this mood where, like, I have to play doubles.

713
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:47,380
But enough about me. What about you?

714
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:52,380
Yeah, I went Saturday morning, just for the hell of it.

715
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:57,380
Yeah, I haven't been in a while, so I was sore.

716
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:02,380
Do you find that when you haven't played in a while, like when you start playing those caddos back to back, you're like...

717
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,380
Yeah.

718
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:04,380
Because that's me.

719
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,380
Smoker.

720
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:06,380
Smokers.

721
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:07,380
Well...

722
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,380
Yeah.

723
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:09,380
Did you take up smoking?

724
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:10,380
No.

725
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,380
Oh, okay.

726
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:12,380
I would compare it to that.

727
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:13,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

728
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:14,380
Something like that.

729
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:15,380
And then if you are a smoker, it's like twice as bad.

730
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:32,700
I see Terry sitting on the computer, so I'll go to Bradley, if we can get a mic over to

731
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:36,420
Bradley. Can we get a mic over to Bradley? Bradley, how was your week and how was your

732
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:47,700
your day? Mostly blah, of course, as usual. Monday was not much. Tuesday I called a temp

733
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:56,820
agency and set up an appointment. Wednesday I did more crap. Thursday I went to this temp

734
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:02,780
agency, basically an accounting-type temp agency, maybe find a data entry job or something

735
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:08,540
of that sort. I did well enough on their excel test. He basically gave me the advanced accounting

736
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:14,340
test instead of the basic one they were supposed to give me. I did well enough on that even

737
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:20,000
though I had studied accounting terms the day before. He also gave me an excel test

738
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,220
so he said, hey, you did well enough on this. Why don't you go take the certification? So

739
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:31,100
I took that and passed that. So we certified down for the general, like the specialist

740
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:38,000
And then Friday I didn't do much of anything. I set up eBay auctions and such. Then Saturday

741
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:51,500
I went and saw The Matrix and Davis and watched The Matrix. I was sort of just sitting there

742
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:56,160
watching it. I don't know if I was really paying attention to it. I was just like, ooh,

743
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:02,900
pretty things, like ships flying around. The action scenes are good, but the dialogue scenes

744
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:10,820
are kind of stupid. So, I sort of liked it and sort of didn't like it. And then today,

745
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,980
more crap. And that's basically everything.

746
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:22,740
Let's go over to Terry and see how your week was.

747
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:27,260
Hello, my week has been very busy.

748
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:31,180
Hey look, there's boobies on the web cam.

749
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,460
Boobies on cam!

750
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:37,340
And how that's possible when there's no women here tonight, I have no idea, but go ahead.

751
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,340
Brad stop showing the boobies.

752
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:42,260
Okay, I've been very busy at work.

753
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:51,580
I'm going to bore you guys on my work, bullcrap, because that's what I'm dealing with is hiring

754
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:57,860
new people and being in a new organization and fun stuff like that.

755
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:04,980
I watched Matrix Revolutions, if you don't see my LJ, which is Vandalous.LiveJournal.com.

756
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:05,980
Oh, nice plug.

757
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:06,980
Hey, thank you.

758
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:10,860
And that is, we watched IMAX, or Revolutions on IMAX.

759
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:12,540
Ah, how was that?

760
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:15,260
It was freaking unbelievable.

761
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,260
I bet.

762
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,740
I bet even a shit movie would be great on IMAX.

763
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:23,740
The Defense of Zion, if you've seen this movie and you watch it on a regular show, on a regular

764
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:26,280
screen, and you go watch it on IMAX, it just blows you away.

765
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,820
The Defense of Zion is unbelievable on that screen.

766
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:29,820
I bet.

767
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:35,700
Anyways, the other kind of cool thing about going down there was, we had one of my friends'

768
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:39,300
roommates go with us, and he's a guy that'll do anything if you start giving him a little

769
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,300
alcohol.

770
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:41,300
Oh goody.

771
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:46,380
And so, this guy's about 240 pounds, about 5'7", he's got about the geekiest glasses

772
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:53,340
you can find, and they got him to take two triple shots of tequila, and so his ears were

773
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:54,340
pretty red.

774
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:58,620
Of course he's over 21 and all that, this is completely legal.

775
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:02,340
And he proceeded to, they convinced him to take off his shirt.

776
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:03,340
This is Gordon Biersch.

777
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:04,340
Oh my!

778
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,340
You know where Gordon Biersch is?

779
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:06,340
On San Francisco.

780
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:12,300
It's right on the corner from Barcadero and Harrison, which is right by the piers.

781
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:16,580
And we took a box out of a trash can, he took off his shirt and proceeded to belly flop

782
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:17,580
it for us.

783
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:24,940
There was a nice light rail going by, it was about 3 o'clock in the afternoon in San Francisco

784
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:28,180
on a Wednesday.

785
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:32,340
And so we needed webcams because we really wanted to capture this and put this on eBay.

786
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:38,380
He would have been the next Star Wars kid, but we were unable to do that.

787
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:42,260
I'm sure someone will post a link to Star Wars Kid if someone starts asking questions.

788
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:44,300
Oh my God.

789
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:49,220
Other than that, my week has been just busy with work stuff and everything and family

790
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:52,580
stuff and home stuff and boring stuff.

791
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:56,580
But I managed to make it here because I'm a day shifter next week.

792
00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:02,600
I work nights and so I work 11 p.m. to 8 a.m., if you can imagine that, the vampire shift.

793
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,080
My older roommate used to work at vampire shifts, but it was at Wal-Mart.

794
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,800
It wasn't a job nearly as cool as yours.

795
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,800
It was enjoyable.

796
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,440
I got to, you know, I like working nights and everything.

797
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,440
It's nice.

798
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,840
But I've got to be on day shift all this week because I've got to hire somebody and do all

799
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,840
that fun stuff.

800
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:17,840
I got you.

801
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,840
Anyways, that's about it.

802
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,840
Boring.

803
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,840
No, it's good to have you here.

804
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,840
Well, thank you.

805
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,680
I'm glad that they switched you to day shift so we could get a chance to have you here,

806
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,520
I am glad for our own selfish reasons we finally got you on the show.

807
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,520
Thank you.

808
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,520
I am glad to be here.

809
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:37,520
As far as my week and my day, nothing too exciting.

810
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:42,160
Thursday went out to golf land and I have been working on my doubles game.

811
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:47,200
I noticed there was one high score list for one of the doubles that had no scores on it.

812
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,080
I thought I would play just to get my name on it.

813
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,340
That was kind of funny.

814
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:52,680
My ego talking there.

815
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,480
and um...

816
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:59,960
What else did I do this week? Not really a whole heck of a lot, but I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy 11

817
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:04,800
Shane, if you're out there, hello, he says, my buddy out in Kansas, we've been playing Final Fantasy 11

818
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,520
like non-stop through the thing

819
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,960
and the nice thing is we've been using this program TeamSpeak

820
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,400
Vandalus, you're a big multiplayer game player, you probably know about this one, right?

821
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,680
TeamSpeak, the one that allows you

822
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:18,340
it basically turns your computer into Xbox Live, where you can use the microphone to talk to

823
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:20,440
people and stuff like that, so it's cool

824
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:23,720
it's been working out good for Final Fantasy XI.

825
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,120
I know I haven't really gone into too much detail about Final Fantasy XI yet, that's

826
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:31,160
because I still, even after two weeks of playing the game, I still feel like I have not scratched

827
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,160
the surface.

828
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:37,160
There's just so much more to discover in the game, and it's just so vast, there's so much

829
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,320
to it.

830
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:42,920
It's unlike any other Final Fantasy game, I still say it's kind of odd that they chose

831
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:47,120
to go with Final Fantasy XI as opposed to Final Fantasy Online, but other than that,

832
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:54,480
I mean, the game's terrific, it's just not what a lot of you are going to expect.

833
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,520
So that was pretty much my week and my day.

834
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,560
I didn't get to go see any cool movies or anything.

835
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,700
Last night, I hung out with the out of town buddy who was here, played a lot of Karaoke

836
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:09,440
Revolution and iToy, the new webcam tool for the PS2 is out, and we've been playing iToy

837
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,440
a lot.

838
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:13,840
And those of you that sit in our chat room during the week saw a random webcam was up

839
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:50,840
You save it as a file, and then you upload it as an attachment to your email through broadband.

840
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,840
You get what I'm saying?

841
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:53,840
Wow.

842
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:58,840
And then you would download it to your memory card using whatever software they have for the PS2.

843
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,840
I don't really know.

844
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:04,840
And then that way you can say, hey, fuck you, and then there will be an attachment.

845
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:11,840
Can you imagine the social hacking you can do with that by convincing these kids,

846
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:15,100
These kids say, hey, turn on your camera and click on this really cool link.

847
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:18,600
And all of a sudden you can get all kinds of really fun voyeur stuff going on in the

848
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,600
house.

849
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:24,440
I'm being kind of sick.

850
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,560
My friends actually told me about that, not me, sorry.

851
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:32,720
Live triple X iToy, people having sex and stuff in rooms with the little bubbles and

852
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,140
stuff floating around and you're popping them.

853
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:39,440
Let's go out to the street and find a couple of whores and make the first iToy porn.

854
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,440
No.

855
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,640
Remember how they have the little rainbow feature and stuff?

856
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:47,240
The guy does the cum shot and is all rainbow-y behind it.

857
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,800
How about Itoy Fight Club?

858
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:53,720
Now see, somebody's telling me that the longest you can do a video on Itoy is one minute.

859
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:54,720
You know what?

860
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,880
One minute's long enough for some guys.

861
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,260
That's a money shot.

862
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:08,600
We can not only invent a new form of internet porn, we can invent a whole new porn genre.

863
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:13,880
one minute porn film in segments just like you know like 24 you know where

864
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:18,080
it's like five second segments or whatever we really need Brad and he's

865
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:23,400
not here to be able to provide some commentary to us that's all right he'll

866
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:27,080
we can we can ask him later if we remember angels got a good comparison

867
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:31,220
though she says I toy reminds her of when you remember the old game show Nick

868
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:36,000
arcade that they would go inside the game and they'd have to do some kind of

869
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,780
stupid thing inside the game. She says the iToy totally reminds her of that and I think

870
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:45,100
she's right on the money. I think that's a damn good comparison. The iToy is like the

871
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,300
last level of Nick Arcade. Wouldn't you say so, Loki?

872
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:55,860
Well, if by making that comparison, if you're saying it looks like bumbling idiots playing

873
00:56:55,860 --> 00:57:04,140
the game, yes, that would be a perfect comparison. All right. Okay, so I think what we're going

874
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,640
to do now is we're going to go ahead and take a break. We're going to do some more pop and

875
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:11,420
music part 10 music and when we come back we're going to talk about karaoke revolutions

876
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:14,700
all the rage this week. We're going to have to give our thoughts on that and the cage

877
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:21,460
match too when we come back. In this break from the pop and 10 music soundtrack you're

878
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:27,540
going to hear the new revenge song. Yes, Naoki's little pseudonym revenge has a new song on

879
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:04,540
music 10 break. You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio. We'll be back.

880
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:28,540
Hey!

881
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:29,540
Hey!

882
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:30,540
Hey!

883
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:31,540
Hey!

884
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:32,540
Hey!

885
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:12,540
This is the end of the video, if you like it, please subscribe to my channel.

886
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:44,540
Oh

887
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:16,540
No shit, don't see me, bye, bye, bye

888
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:22,540
Where there's nothing on the way, oh you're there

889
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:19,540
To be thoughts when they're dead

890
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:23,540
Time has come now

891
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:26,540
We must go back there now

892
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:32,540
To save the place where we end up and die

893
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:35,540
Out in the sky

894
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:38,540
To the rest we can fly

895
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:42,540
For the light

896
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:45,540
Change is still a legend

897
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:48,540
Keep your peace and send it

898
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:51,540
Evil beckons to the night

899
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:55,540
This is the end of all

900
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:28,540
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because Real Radio makes Captain Jack cry.

901
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:55,540
Hello, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

902
01:03:55,540 --> 01:04:00,540
Some more music in that break from the Pomp and Music 10 soundtrack.

903
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:03,540
What did you guys think of some of those songs here?

904
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:06,540
Let's start off with the Revenge track.

905
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:09,540
It was Ara Bhatia. What did you guys think of that one?

906
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:15,540
This is interesting. It sounds just like a God of Death info with fucking Max Unlimited samples.

907
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:18,540
Seriously, they need to get away from Max Unlimited.

908
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:24,540
Let the max die, step away from the max.

909
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:31,540
Yeah, good stuff. It's exotic ethnic, which is already good, so good stuff.

910
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:34,540
Whatever, if they want to use samples from another song, it's fine with me.

911
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:38,540
I mean, all these popular European and American DJs constantly use samples.

912
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:42,540
Yeah, but they use good samples. That's such a bad sample.

913
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:45,540
That sample right there makes me really pissed off at the song.

914
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:51,980
Just like the ending of Matrix Revolutions, how they fucked up that song and made fun

915
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:52,980
of the Hindus and stuff.

916
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:53,980
It makes me hate the movie.

917
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:54,980
God, some people.

918
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:55,980
You know...

919
01:04:55,980 --> 01:05:00,420
I haven't even seen the movie yet, so I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

920
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:02,380
What kind of irks me about the...

921
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:03,380
It's a decent song.

922
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:04,380
It's kind of fun.

923
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:07,980
It's one of the better songs on the soundtrack, but I still picture Revenge as always doing

924
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:12,300
these DDR songs and stuff, and there's no kind of backbeat to it, so I can't imagine

925
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:15,500
myself dancing to it, and for some reason that makes me not like it.

926
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:35,300
It's much more well-suited for 2DX than it is for BAG, but anyhow, that's fine.

927
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:42,500
Revenge has always been Naoki trying to attempt to do ethnic sounding music, and that's fine

928
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:43,940
if it doesn't have a beat.

929
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:48,620
That's why it's in Papa Music and not DDR, whatever.

930
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:53,420
The next song was from a group called Komo Tomak, and it's the genre of lonely, and it's

931
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:54,420
Artemis.

932
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:59,500
And there's actually a long version of this on the Papa Music 10 soundtrack.

933
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,060
Any thoughts on that?

934
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:02,060
Where's Luna?

935
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:04,060
And Sailor Moon and Sailor Mercury.

936
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:37,720
so funny. I want to see it. It's so cheesy. It's as he says, ill-conceived. It can't be

937
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:42,220
better than Strangers with Candy, though. Oh, well, no. It's not trying to be funny.

938
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:46,100
No. It's funny because it's stupid. I thought you were telling me that the people that translated

939
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:51,500
it or did the fan sub or whatever, that they tried to make it funny. They skipped. They

940
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:59,140
did some parody. They left in some commercials that are showing over in Japan, like a McDonald's

941
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:03,740
commercial with this Japanese Ronald McDonald and they they left in the

942
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:07,460
commercials and they did a little parody fan sub to it like the McDonald's one

943
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:11,420
shows the Ronald McDonald coming over and helping this little girl play with

944
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:14,300
their friends because no one was like playing with her so she goes and plays

945
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:17,980
with her and at the end it's got a little monologue by by Ronald McDonald

946
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:20,860
and he says something Japanese I don't understand Japanese I don't know what he's

947
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:25,300
saying but the subtitle says I'll always be watching you especially when you're

948
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:32,240
And then there's this other one where it's like these girls in panties, little girls

949
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:36,200
wearing diapers, and it's a diaper commercial or something, and it says,

950
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,200
Pansufaito!

951
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,200
Pansufaito!

952
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:45,420
And at the end it goes, it goes, buy these panties guaranteed pre-worn by a petalicious

953
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:47,920
girl just like this one.

954
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:48,920
It's so great!

955
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:54,440
Or the Sailor Moon memorabilia they sell, like these wands and stuff.

956
01:07:54,440 --> 01:08:01,320
Oh yeah, but they sell the memorabilia and it's like, what does he say, buy our Sailor

957
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:06,620
Moon toys so you can transform, just like Sailor Moon.

958
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:13,800
And then at the end it goes, successful transformation, not guaranteed.

959
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:17,920
Or the Hello Kitty one where it's like, hello kitty, hello kitty, or it's like, I don't

960
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,540
know, something Nick, hello kitty, hello kitty.

961
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:25,820
the bottom it says evil kitty, evil kitty, evil kitty, and then it's like buy evil kitty

962
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:32,700
mind control candy so we can control your kids and stuff like that. It's great.

963
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:37,700
The last song we heard in that break was Sastro with Holy Forest.

964
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:47,700
What did you think of that? Holy Forest, Batman.

965
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:50,780
It's very J-Rock to me.

966
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:55,100
I picture G.A.C.T. and ambiguous men singing high-pitched songs.

967
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:59,780
It sounds to me like a melismizer thing, which is what G.A.C.T. is from.

968
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:01,420
Good stuff.

969
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:06,060
I'm not quite sure how it will play on pop music, but we'll see when it comes out here

970
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:09,060
or not here for home.

971
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:13,220
Interesting point you brought up when we were listening to the soundtrack last night was

972
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:23,400
I hear this with 2DX, but you said that you hear a lot of songs in pop music that really

973
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,680
are better suited for guitar freaks.

974
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:29,800
Almost like they didn't make the cut for guitar freaks, but they really should have.

975
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,720
That song strikes me as one of those.

976
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:35,320
Or the good, cool, and Jeff Kootz song, Blaster.

977
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:36,320
Which we'll hear later.

978
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:39,320
We're going to hear some Taka and some Tack and Desro too.

979
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:41,320
Oh, the Des-Q song.

980
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:42,320
Yeah, the Des-Q.

981
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:44,320
The Desro with DJ Taka.

982
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:45,320
I mean, not DJ Taka.

983
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:46,320
Tack.

984
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:52,320
And, um, yeah, like, these songs should really be on Guitar Cookies and Drummania if they're continuing to make these games.

985
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:55,320
I mean, why put, whatever, I don't know.

986
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:57,320
Konami's kind of losing their mind.

987
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:59,320
So, whatever.

988
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,320
Okay.

989
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:06,320
Alright, so that was the music in a Popin' 10 soundtrack, and we'll do some more later,

990
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:12,440
but first, this is all the rage this week. Out now, just came out this week, a brand

991
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:16,440
new Bomani game. Something brand new, and it's not in the arcades, it's only for the

992
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:22,600
home, and America, shock, got it first. Because the Japanese are getting a better version,

993
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:26,520
but that's alright, America got something first. We got some new Bomani, and yes, it

994
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:30,680
actually carries a Bomani logo, so this is an official new Bomani game, so we can talk

995
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:36,680
I'm sure you've heard about it by now.

996
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:39,680
Karaoke Revolution, out this week.

997
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:42,680
What are your guys' impressions of Karaoke Revolution?

998
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:44,680
First, does somebody want to try and describe the game?

999
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:46,680
Because I know not even all of us here have played it yet,

1000
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:48,680
but does somebody want to try and describe the game?

1001
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:49,680
Like how it plays?

1002
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:50,680
Yeah, how it plays.

1003
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,680
Because I think a lot of people still haven't gotten how it works yet.

1004
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:53,680
You want to try and explain it, Brad?

1005
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,680
First you go to the store and you shell out $70.

1006
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,680
Okay, after that.

1007
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:06,680
Then you bring it home and you look at it, you ooble it, you rattle it, you get a microphone-headset combination like what Britney Spears and Madonna uses.

1008
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,680
You put this thing on and you go into it.

1009
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:17,680
You pick levels, you pick a song and you pick a level and it's got a crowd of people.

1010
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:22,680
There's a band behind you, there's a character you pick who dances and they're over-developed in the head.

1011
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:31,160
head, and they sing, and at the bottom is, like, you know, if anybody's ever seen karaoke,

1012
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:34,720
words go by, or usually words are there, and then they light up as you're supposed to sing.

1013
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:37,040
Yeah, the words, like, do this whole screen full of words.

1014
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:41,680
Yeah, except with this, at the very bottom, there's, like, a rectangular section, takes

1015
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:46,200
up probably a third of the screen, or a quarter of the screen at the bottom, that has the

1016
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:50,280
words that go from right to left. They scroll across the screen.

1017
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:54,280
It's like watching the news on CNN and the words throw by on the bottom.

1018
01:11:54,280 --> 01:12:00,760
And on the left is a line similar to any beat mania or DDR, it's a judgment line where you

1019
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:03,320
have to start here.

1020
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:07,840
And then from the top to the bottom where the words are, are lines of how long you're

1021
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:08,900
supposed to hold a note.

1022
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:14,800
And they move up, they go up and down depending on if the note should be high or low or whatnot.

1023
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:20,960
And some of the notes, and I'm not going to sing, but they'll go like, mmm, they'll rise.

1024
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:23,520
You'll see the little line go up or down.

1025
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:27,880
So you kind of have to follow the tone of it.

1026
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:29,320
It just judges on the tone of it.

1027
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:34,240
So you can pretty much make up any word you want or go la la la la, or like I did for

1028
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:35,800
It's the End of the World.

1029
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:42,800
Instead of doing the rap thing that he does, I go da da da da da, land on Burt Stein.

1030
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,280
The whole thing and I got it.

1031
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:45,780
It's the only part of that rap I know is,

1032
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:47,780
Na-na-na, na-na-na, Leonard Bernstein.

1033
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,280
Exactly.

1034
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,280
And it is so much fun.

1035
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,980
This is like the newest and best party game.

1036
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:54,680
They were right.

1037
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,700
I was kind of like, hmm, I don't know,

1038
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:59,160
when they were saying that it was going to be this big hit.

1039
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:01,720
But as soon as we turned this on, I was like, oh my god,

1040
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:04,120
this has so much possibility in America.

1041
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:06,440
I never thought I would hear you sing,

1042
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:08,360
but this game finally got it.

1043
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:10,680
Well, I tried it, and I realized, like I thought

1044
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:11,680
before that I can't sing.

1045
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:12,920
So I just started to fuck around.

1046
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:13,840
I started like saying.

1047
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:14,840
Pretty good!

1048
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:18,000
Fuck this game, this game fucking sucks, and it would still judge me right, so I was like

1049
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
cool!

1050
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,320
Because it just grades on tone, and if it sounds like, because you can put lead vocals

1051
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:26,040
on where they have a pre-recorded, it's not the original artist, but a lead, a person

1052
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:31,600
singing along, if that's on and that person is singing really high, you can drop your

1053
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:37,540
octave and it still grades, because it's got a pretty sophisticated tone recognition system

1054
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:38,540
in it.

1055
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:39,540
It's really good.

1056
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,320
So, good stuff.

1057
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:47,180
really funny to see because each song only has the lead vocals is only sung in

1058
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:50,940
the gender of the person who originally wrote the song or sang the song so like

1059
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:57,460
hmm let's see here the Madonna song what which one is it like a virgin like a

1060
01:13:57,460 --> 01:14:02,980
virgin is sung in it by a girl and if you pick a male character they're up on

1061
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:06,500
the screen singing and there's a female voice coming out of their mouth and

1062
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:11,080
their lips are synced to the singing so it's really funny to watch like this

1063
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:18,080
black guy get up there and go like, La, la, la, la, like a virgin, ooh, ooh, ooh, it's

1064
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,080
good stuff.

1065
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,680
I have to agree, this is a great game.

1066
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:26,220
I was really skeptical about it at first, but it's fucking great.

1067
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:27,680
It's a great idea.

1068
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:31,080
My only kind of, I have a couple of concerns with it though.

1069
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:35,800
I mean, it's a great game, great party game, but as a solo game, it's not something I could

1070
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:38,040
see myself kind of motivating myself to do solo.

1071
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:44,520
So it will, whereas DDR will not make you a better dancer, Karaoke Revolution will make

1072
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,520
you a better singer.

1073
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:46,520
Maybe.

1074
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:47,760
I don't know yet.

1075
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:52,800
It'll help, it helps show you if you're on key or not, A. B, it helps you to kind of

1076
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,120
hold your pitch and maintain your pitch.

1077
01:14:55,120 --> 01:15:00,220
That's the biggest thing about it, is it really, really the way you get better at singing is

1078
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:01,800
by singing more and more.

1079
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:04,800
So Karaoke Revolution will help you be a better singer.

1080
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:09,920
It won't turn you into an all-star, but it will help you go from not so great, but to

1081
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:10,920
decent.

1082
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:13,680
Well, see, on the songs that it's got on there, it will point out to you that, hey, you're

1083
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:16,920
not supposed to sing the song this certain way.

1084
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:19,740
It actually shows you the way the song is supposed to be sung.

1085
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:23,540
For most parts, I noticed that in some of the songs, it looks like they programmed the

1086
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:28,320
lines in, the grading in, like maybe a little different than the original singer sang it.

1087
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:31,680
I got kind of confused on some of the songs, I was like, wait a minute, the line is going

1088
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:36,520
up, or it stays straight when the singer is actually raising their pitch or lowering it

1089
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:39,520
and whatnot.

1090
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:46,640
The biggest thing I don't like about it is that it's coded, the lines that go by that

1091
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:51,140
you're supposed to sing are coded in only one way, so you can only sing the song in

1092
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:54,840
one way as far as your tone.

1093
01:15:54,840 --> 01:16:00,520
You can't improvise, you can improvise words, unless you play non-judge mode.

1094
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:02,360
There is a free mode that you're not judged.

1095
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:04,840
And you say you're not judged, so it's almost like not even really worth playing.

1096
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:08,240
It's like, might as well just sing along to any song.

1097
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:12,700
I wish that they had kind of like an edit mode where you can edit the lines in any way

1098
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:14,180
you wanted to.

1099
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:18,240
Like say you sang it without lines, and it would record those lines as you're singing

1100
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,240
it.

1101
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:20,240
Like an edit mode.

1102
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,240
Like an edit mode for steps.

1103
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:22,240
That's kind of weird, okay.

1104
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:57,000
Like one person in the back, you'll hear somebody yell, you rock!

1105
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:58,000
It's really funny.

1106
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,440
You have to listen for the small things in Character Evolution.

1107
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:05,920
I think it's advertisement for the Matrix, though, because most of the people in the

1108
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,560
crowd are all agents.

1109
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:10,000
They all look exactly the same, wearing the same thing.

1110
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Yes.

1111
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,460
For the best, when you suck, they start walking away.

1112
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:19,000
And then if you totally fail the song, your person breaks down and cries on the stage.

1113
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
They fall to the ground.

1114
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
It's great.

1115
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:25,760
What do you think of the song list?

1116
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:28,480
I've heard some complaints, and this is kind of one of my chief complaints, it's kind of

1117
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:34,760
not enough songs, but all things considered, they only licensed 35 songs or whatever.

1118
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:39,760
There are 35 pretty solid songs, they have a pretty damn good mix of music in it, I think.

1119
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:45,120
I think there's at least one, two songs that everybody's going to dig.

1120
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:49,760
Like when we fired it up and Broken Wings was in it, Loki was like, oh my God, cool.

1121
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:50,760
Yeah, exactly.

1122
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:59,920
are some great classics in this. I mean, some of the best classic 80s music and some of

1123
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:03,480
the better pop music, because I'm not a big fan of pop, you know, but some of the better

1124
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:06,840
pop music in here. I'm kind of a mild fan of Top 40 pop. There's

1125
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:10,200
a lot of it I don't like, but there's a lot of it I do like, and I was really happy to

1126
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:13,680
see that there were a couple of Michelle Branch songs in there, because I dig her and stuff.

1127
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:16,440
They have some good... Yeah, actually, I think they did a very good

1128
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:21,440
job in the song selection except for, and I understand the reason why they did this,

1129
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:25,760
I think, if it's the same reason I'm thinking, putting in songs like Son of a Preacher or

1130
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:26,760
whatever.

1131
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:27,760
You know, whatever it's called.

1132
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:36,280
You are still mad that you got the Chain of Fools song on random last night.

1133
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:38,600
You are still mad you had to sing that last night.

1134
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:41,720
Like they put some really stupid songs in, but that's just my opinion.

1135
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:44,880
I know there are people out there that love these songs, these are classics.

1136
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,880
I understand the purpose, it's just like, what?

1137
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:48,880
I don't want to sing to the pool.

1138
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:51,880
There's going to be just as many songs that you hate as there are going to be that you

1139
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:52,880
love.

1140
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:54,880
There's less songs that I hate than there are songs that I like.

1141
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:57,880
And like Bazaar and Love Triangle, it was like, oh my God.

1142
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:03,880
Yeah, some of the great 80s songs like Bazaar and Love Triangle, there was some other ones,

1143
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:04,880
but there's some good songs in there.

1144
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:08,880
Pardon me for saying, but they've done a better job licensing music for Karaoke Revolution

1145
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:09,880
than they have for DDR.

1146
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:11,880
For anything they've ever done.

1147
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:16,780
revolution than they have for DDR for anything they've ever done this is it's

1148
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:21,080
good stuff and and I just hope that we get some good expansion discs here in

1149
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:26,560
America because yes there will be expansion discs because in the options

1150
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:30,400
menu if you go to an options menu in the game there is an option to put in an

1151
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:34,440
expansion disc if you hit the option that the machine will eject and it just

1152
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:38,320
like a pen mode in DDR just like that I hope there's some really good stuff on

1153
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:44,100
the expansion. If it's anything like what they released on the core mix that they just

1154
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:48,100
released, then we've got some good music coming out for the expansion.

1155
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:52,720
It really depends, I think, on how this game takes off. If it's really popular, if it goes

1156
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:58,240
DDR style, then I think we'll see really specialized discs where it's going to be like women hits

1157
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:01,480
of the 90s type thing, expansion discs, then male hits of the 90s type thing.

1158
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:06,100
It's all dependent on how they advertise this thing, and Konami in America has not been

1159
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:14,300
been known for the best advertising campaigns, so it's, well, UltraMix, Microsoft is backing

1160
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:15,300
it, so it's everywhere.

1161
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:21,220
Yeah, UltraMix has just the Xbox thing, because I think Xbox kind of knows, like Xbox is still

1162
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:25,620
kind of struggling a little bit, and I think they know if they can take the DDR market

1163
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:30,540
a little bit, then they're going to have some more machines being sold.

1164
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:31,540
Unfortunately.

1165
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:35,120
I never, never considered buying an Xbox until UltraMix was announced, and now that I've

1166
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:38,520
I've seen the video which is out on the official site, maybe we'll have to have this later,

1167
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:43,360
but there's a video out on the official site and it's, wow, I'm very impressed that they've

1168
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:48,240
kind of just done what they've needed to do for DDR for a long time.

1169
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:49,240
Give it a facelift.

1170
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:50,240
Yeah.

1171
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:55,080
Something I'm kind of interested in, and I know there's a few other dorky, otaku type

1172
01:20:55,080 --> 01:21:00,020
people out there who agree with me, people who listen to J-rock and other Japanese J-pop

1173
01:21:00,020 --> 01:21:04,480
and Japanese music, because I solely listen to Japanese stuff because I think America's

1174
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:08,600
making bullshit music right now. There's nothing good out there right now. So I'm listening

1175
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:16,280
to other countries' music and stuff. I hope that the Japanese versions are worthy of bringing

1176
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:21,240
over, well not bringing over here, but for me to import, because there's a lot of J-Rock

1177
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:25,300
and J-Pop songs that I really, really like that I would love to get to play in Karaoke

1178
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:29,120
Revolution, you know? I hope some Lark and Seal stuff shows up, or you know.

1179
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:34,120
I was going to say, in Japan, they are doing karaoke revolution in Japan too, and if you

1180
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:41,180
go to the official karaoke revolution website for Japan, six expansion discs are coming

1181
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:42,180
out this month.

1182
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:43,180
I think later this month.

1183
01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:46,520
Six discs, and we're talking, and they kind of do the genre thing a little bit because

1184
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:50,920
there's one that's specifically for ballads, and then there's a couple J-pop hits, and

1185
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:51,920
things like that.

1186
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:56,240
And there are groups, Morning Musume, Ayumi, of course, Ayumi's on there of course.

1187
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:58,900
What were some of the other bands?

1188
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:00,260
You remember any of them, Loki?

1189
01:22:00,260 --> 01:22:01,260
I don't know, but...

1190
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:02,420
I just remember Morning Musume.

1191
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:05,580
I can't wait to sing, uh, Chokoto Love, what Petit Love was based off of.

1192
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:07,460
I don't think Chokoto Love was on there.

1193
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:08,460
Really?

1194
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:09,460
No, I don't.

1195
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:10,460
I would have recognized it.

1196
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:11,460
I think.

1197
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:12,460
I may have missed it.

1198
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:13,460
I may have missed it.

1199
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:14,460
Or the original Freckles Suboxis.

1200
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:15,460
Uh, however you pronounce it.

1201
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:16,460
Yeah.

1202
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:17,460
All right.

1203
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:18,460
That would be great.

1204
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:19,460
Terry, uh, comment?

1205
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:20,460
Oh, actually.

1206
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:22,060
My parents have something that's kind of like this.

1207
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:27,060
It's a, um, this stand-alone DVD karaoke-based thing that does the same kind of thing.

1208
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:30,940
It measures the tone and the timing that you do.

1209
01:22:30,940 --> 01:22:38,660
It's got nine DVDs of Korean, Japanese, Filipino, Chinese, and American music.

1210
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:39,660
The DVDs are swappable.

1211
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:42,140
The thing is, it's about $400.

1212
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:46,740
It's totally awesome because every time we go down there, we spend the first day just

1213
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:47,740
doing this thing.

1214
01:22:47,740 --> 01:22:48,740
I'm doing gangsters.

1215
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:56,300
It's great because the backgrounds have absolutely nothing to do with the show.

1216
01:22:56,300 --> 01:23:01,360
They had Gangsta's Paradise, and the background is showing this peaceful little farm, almost

1217
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:05,680
like it should be Amish Paradise, and it was, it's just great.

1218
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:08,120
That reminds me of when we went to, was it Cyberzone?

1219
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:09,120
Yeah.

1220
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:10,120
And they had the karaoke booth.

1221
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:11,120
Oh my god, the karaoke game?

1222
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,120
The karaoke booth?

1223
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:15,620
And they had all these songs you get to play, and it does grade you, but we couldn't figure

1224
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:17,620
out how it grades you, because at the end it would give you like a really high grade.

1225
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:22,340
It just gave you a score, and we didn't, no, because I remember Irene and I found Smile

1226
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:26,180
D.K., Butterfly, and Boyz. We found Smile D.K. in the book, and we're like,

1227
01:23:26,180 --> 01:23:29,220
hee hee, we're going to sing the DDR song. And we sang Boyz, and we got 100.

1228
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:32,580
And we got the big fanfare and everything. That's the thing is, I noticed you guys suck,

1229
01:23:32,580 --> 01:23:35,260
and you still got high credit. Shut up!

1230
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:38,420
Anyway, well, I mean, I read some of that. Oh my, you don't even want to know how much

1231
01:23:38,420 --> 01:23:40,620
time I spent in that stupid karaoke room at the tournament.

1232
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:44,300
I was there, man. You were in there all the time with her. I was like, man, get out of

1233
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:46,300
there. It was so much fun. We had a blast. We were

1234
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:49,900
laughing our ass off in there. Like, the great thing is, just like Terry

1235
01:23:49,900 --> 01:24:08,900
This video has nothing to do with anything, it's to throw you off, totally.

1236
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:13,940
Yeah, that's the thing though is that this game if you've any if you've played I don't know about the one that Terry is talking about

1237
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:18,300
But I would assume it's kind of like the one that we saw in cyberzone where it grades you

1238
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:22,520
But this thing is like a really really accurate grading system this karaoke revolution

1239
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:28,580
I was so surprised at how much work they put into it. Why don't they put some more work into DVR like they did this?

1240
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:33,700
Some some other comments from chow and address some comments that came up in the chat room one comment

1241
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:36,220
Why don't you buy karaoke revolution for the Japanese ps2?

1242
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:41,420
So not likely to happen unless they release some kind of American songs expansion pack

1243
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:47,460
because I can't sing in Japanese and I'm not going to just fake it, I mean I don't know

1244
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:48,460
any of the songs.

1245
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:54,180
I don't listen to Jay music as much as Brad does, maybe he would like it, but I just wouldn't

1246
01:24:54,180 --> 01:24:56,580
know the songs well enough to necessitate buying it.

1247
01:24:56,580 --> 01:25:00,100
I think this is one of those rare cases where the American version has something for me

1248
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:01,700
and the Japanese doesn't.

1249
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:07,660
It's just for those people like me, I don't understand Japanese, but from listening to

1250
01:25:07,660 --> 01:25:17,800
a lot of Japanese music, like Aimee Miyazaki, Lark and Seal, tons of Japanese pop and rock

1251
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:22,100
artists and stuff, I can pick up a lot of these words and I start to know the lyrics.

1252
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:26,220
I'll look at the lyrics and I can sing the lyrics in Japanese.

1253
01:25:26,220 --> 01:25:29,060
I have no fucking idea what they're talking about, they could be saying, you stupid hunky

1254
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:35,860
bitches from America stop buying our shit, or doing this stuff. But for me, or for anybody

1255
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:40,460
like me who's that into it, yeah, you could go ahead and import the Japanese versions.

1256
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:44,860
I might, depending on how good the Japanese versions are, what kind of songs are on them.

1257
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:50,540
But somebody like Rob, I don't think he really cares to fake singing in Japanese.

1258
01:25:50,540 --> 01:25:54,640
I think my time's just better spent making myself better singing American songs, because

1259
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:57,280
I go to actual karaoke bars and sing sometimes.

1260
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:04,560
You're not going to go to a karaoke bar and start singing something in Japanese.

1261
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:05,560
People would be like...

1262
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:09,220
I have seen, because they do let you bring in your own music, and I saw somebody once

1263
01:26:09,220 --> 01:26:18,180
they brought in, it was an Indian song, it sounded like it was straight out of a Bollywood

1264
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:22,020
picture type thing, and he was doing the dance and everything, it was great.

1265
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:23,460
I mean, I was entertained by it.

1266
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:25,740
I didn't know what the hell he was saying, but it was totally entertaining.

1267
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:28,140
Yeah, well you get your freaks in there every once in a while.

1268
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:29,980
Well, you know, I wouldn't say he was a freak.

1269
01:26:29,980 --> 01:26:30,980
He was...

1270
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:31,980
He brought up forces.

1271
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:32,980
He brought up forces.

1272
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:33,980
He brought up forces.

1273
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:34,980
Confusing language.

1274
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:35,980
You're an ass.

1275
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:36,980
You're an ass.

1276
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:37,980
Confusing language.

1277
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:38,980
Seriously.

1278
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:49,420
Okay, what were some other things I wanted to address in the room?

1279
01:26:49,420 --> 01:26:57,040
Oh, yes, Mel B, a favorite guest of Orange Lawns Radio, has a cameo in KOG Revolution

1280
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:59,520
and it's actually in a video that you unlock.

1281
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:04,720
We haven't gotten it ourselves yet, but apparently you can unlock the song one week when you

1282
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:10,640
beat Solo Mode and you get a video with it, too, in the video section, and apparently

1283
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:13,200
Mel B is in there singing a little bit of one week.

1284
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:17,380
It's a clip of all these people singing one week and apparently he's in it, so of course

1285
01:27:17,380 --> 01:27:18,880
you know we're going to unlock that shit this week.

1286
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:22,840
do it now and we will play it on the show for you next week and maybe we can get Loki

1287
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:26,800
to remix it. Sorry guys we're cutting off the show now

1288
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:31,620
we have to go unlock Mel B's video. I want to wait until the next time he's actually

1289
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:34,320
here on the show which might not be hopefully in the next couple weeks.

1290
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:38,340
Tell him to unlock it now. I'm going to unlock it now so I can see it

1291
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:44,060
but I want to get him here and then play it over and over and say hey Mel and play the

1292
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:47,860
sound and then, you know, embarrass the shit out of them.

1293
01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:51,620
I don't know. I don't know what it is yet. We will see soon. But I hear it's really cute

1294
01:27:51,620 --> 01:27:55,820
that they even have like a, they have a dog wearing the headset at one point, and it barks.

1295
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:59,520
Aww, cute. Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf. Which is, you know, what the original song kind

1296
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:07,380
of sounds like to me. Any other thoughts on Karaoke Revolution?

1297
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:12,220
Thank God they don't have that stupid song All Star in there. That's all I gotta say.

1298
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:14,680
hey now you're an all-star that one

1299
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:17,260
yeah why such a hatred on that specific song

1300
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:21,880
cuz they use it like every single fucking movie trailer and shit for like

1301
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:26,440
all these lame ass movies you know you have mystery man and shrek

1302
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:30,580
i like the movie too but the trailer was lame garbage

1303
01:28:30,580 --> 01:28:35,260
okay and shrek 2 which i just saw before elf

1304
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:37,060
also had that

1305
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:38,380
yeah shrek 2

1306
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:41,500
also had the god damn song on it too

1307
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:45,500
It's just like, ugh!

1308
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:46,500
Hey Loki, Shrek 2?

1309
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:49,500
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your-

1310
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,500
I'm gonna punch you.

1311
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:53,500
I don't like that song either, I don't-

1312
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:54,500
I hate it too.

1313
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:56,500
Is that Smash Mouth?

1314
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:58,500
Fuck Smash Mouth.

1315
01:28:58,500 --> 01:28:59,500
No thanks.

1316
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:02,500
They're doing all these commercials now because they can't make any more music.

1317
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:05,500
They're constantly doing educational commercials and shit.

1318
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:06,500
It's so stupid.

1319
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:10,500
any more thoughts on karaoke revolution Brad?

1320
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:14,500
being one of the only other ones that's played it, the other ones I can tell were boring

1321
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:18,500
everyone else here they're like yeah haven't played it, go out and buy it

1322
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:22,500
please everybody, cause we want Konami to get more money off of this

1323
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:26,500
so that they can go ahead and make more stuff like this in America

1324
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:30,500
then again maybe if we tell them to not buy it and it does bad, maybe they'll put more of their

1325
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:34,500
time and money into games like Castlevania instead of... and DDR

1326
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:38,500
No, I could give a fuck about DVR as long as I'm getting my Castlevania on.

1327
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:10,500
pretty darn good song. It's a group called CyberX and it features somebody named Rupina

1328
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:14,420
and it's called Little Flower. The way the cage match works is that we're going to play

1329
01:30:14,420 --> 01:30:18,000
three songs for you guys and you vote for your favorite and that song goes into rotation

1330
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:22,620
all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bimani Music and More program. But you have to be

1331
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:28,120
in our chat room to play along so head over to www.calibimani.com, click on Orange Lounge

1332
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:32,460
and click on chat. Whole shitload of people in our chat room tonight. It's more crowded

1333
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:39,460
the first song you can vote for tonight.

1334
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:13,460
I can't believe this is the last time I've ever felt like this

1335
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:20,460
I can't believe this is the last time I've ever felt like this

1336
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:26,480
fights with every was about the cheese

1337
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:28,360
I know you haven't

1338
01:31:28,360 --> 01:31:22,860
called

1339
01:31:32,380 --> 01:31:34,380
Oh

1340
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:41,740
Oh

1341
01:33:41,740 --> 01:34:09,580
Alright, that was about half of last week's winner, CyberX featuring Rupino with Little

1342
01:34:39,580 --> 01:34:42,580
It was huge. A lot of you liked it. It was Sandstorm.

1343
01:34:42,580 --> 01:34:46,580
And Darude has a new song out now that is my pick for tonight's cave match. It's called Music.

1344
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:49,580
And it's not like, hey Mr. DJ kind of music, but it's, you know.

1345
01:34:49,580 --> 01:34:53,580
Or, I got a music, don't stop.

1346
01:34:53,580 --> 01:34:56,580
I don't think there's, there isn't, Darude's not in UltraMix.

1347
01:34:56,580 --> 01:34:59,580
No.

1348
01:34:59,580 --> 01:35:05,580
Well, whatever. I don't care if it's going to be in DDR in the future.

1349
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:12,580
I think it would be good for DDR, though, but anyway, here's my pick for tonight's cage match. It's Darude with music. Enjoy.

1350
01:35:35,580 --> 01:35:40,580
to

1351
01:35:40,580 --> 01:35:45,580
the

1352
01:35:45,580 --> 01:35:50,580
the

1353
01:35:50,580 --> 01:35:55,580
the

1354
01:35:55,580 --> 01:36:00,580
the

1355
01:36:30,580 --> 01:36:58,580
Don't you think, B.J., live it, record to the fact, don't you think, live it, don't you think,

1356
01:37:58,580 --> 01:38:00,580
Oh

1357
01:38:28,580 --> 01:38:35,580
Let's go around and see what folks thought of that, we'll start with Brad.

1358
01:38:58,580 --> 01:39:06,580
Pretty good. I don't think I'm a huge fan of Darude, because they're kind of a cookie-cutter trance for me.

1359
01:39:06,580 --> 01:39:12,580
But it's still good. I would have to vote for that if I could only vote for the last song or this song.

1360
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:15,580
Alright. And scale 1 to 10?

1361
01:39:15,580 --> 01:39:18,580
Scale 1 to 10? I'll give it a 7.

1362
01:39:18,580 --> 01:39:21,580
Alright. Will!

1363
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:26,580
pvtsteve didn't you send this to me a long time ago?

1364
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:41,580
pvtsteve it's not bad though

1365
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:16,580
kostjamrh I remember when we used to do the secret word of the day and stuff, when we used to be falling down laughing because we'd be making fun of ravers.

1366
01:40:25,580 --> 01:40:30,580
kostjamrh I remember when OrangeZion's radio was funny.

1367
01:40:31,580 --> 01:40:36,580
kostjamrh I gave it a 6

1368
01:40:36,580 --> 01:40:43,580
I thought it was very trance-y and very repetitive, like trance-y songs can be.

1369
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:45,580
And I'd give that one a 7.

1370
01:40:45,580 --> 01:40:47,580
I definitely liked it better than the first one.

1371
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:51,580
Bradley, your thoughts on Darude music?

1372
01:40:51,580 --> 01:40:55,580
Pretty much the same as everyone else is kind of saying.

1373
01:40:55,580 --> 01:41:00,580
Sort of there and repetitive, but not too bad, so a 7.

1374
01:41:00,580 --> 01:41:02,580
All right.

1375
01:41:02,580 --> 01:41:09,580
I give it an 8, because no song named Music is allowed to be a 10 unless it's Madonna.

1376
01:41:14,580 --> 01:41:19,580
Now if it was Madonna remixed by Oak and Fold, because I know they have one of Music.

1377
01:41:20,580 --> 01:41:22,580
Oak and Fold does some great Madonna mixes.

1378
01:41:22,580 --> 01:41:25,580
Oak and Fold can take anything and make it good.

1379
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:32,000
God dammit, I almost picked the Oak and Fold song for tonight's

1380
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:39,000
I would come!

1381
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Kill Bill, Battle Without Honor or Humanity, The 88 Severed Limbs Mix

1382
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,500
The light and knowledge that we need to be the best of a black man

1383
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:36,500
This wizard was a fan of the waves of a dark land

1384
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:38,500
The terror that had us through it, everything we proved

1385
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:40,500
It's Friday the first day, you go a-fucking-through

1386
01:44:40,500 --> 01:44:42,500
It's dangerous if I don't mind, it's pretty dark and fine

1387
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:44,500
It's same with the sirens, dance with the gooey swine

1388
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:45,500
This thing that's only once vain

1389
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:47,500
This body, I'm at the hop, bummer and sing a song

1390
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:49,500
I wanna run the father, maybe it'll be wrong

1391
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:26,500
2. Battle Without Honor or Humanity 88-Severed Limbs Mix

1392
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:54,500
That was awesome. That's all I have to say. That is getting 5,000 out of 10.

1393
01:45:57,500 --> 01:45:59,500
So there you go. I'm stroking his ego.

1394
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:02,500
Looks like you're stroking your dick there, too. That's what made you so happy.

1395
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:07,500
Well, I got some sticky stuff on my fingers from licking something.

1396
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:10,500
Will, your thoughts?

1397
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:35,500
kostjamrh Yeah, that song pretty much owned the rest of the song, so I'd give that one.

1398
01:46:35,500 --> 01:46:42,500
kostjamrh I give it a 1 and then a 0 for a 10.

1399
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:10,500
dukeofthebump

1400
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:39,500
dukeofthebump

1401
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:12,500
Alright, let's review. But you know what? As much as we might like that song, it's really up to you guys in the chat room. You guys have the votes.

1402
01:48:12,500 --> 01:48:15,500
So here it is. We're going to recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.

1403
01:48:15,500 --> 01:48:21,500
You send your votes over private message to Sky in the chat room. Hello, I'm there in the chat room waiting for your vote.

1404
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:27,500
Song number one you can vote for tonight. Last week's winner, two weeks in a row now, CyberX featuring Groupino with Little Flower.

1405
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:51,300
All right, song number two that you can vote for tonight is Darude with Music.

1406
01:48:51,300 --> 01:48:54,820
All right, and song number three that you can vote for tonight is Battle Without a Honor

1407
01:48:54,820 --> 01:48:57,060
or Humanity, the 88 Severed Limbs mix.

1408
01:48:57,060 --> 01:48:58,060
This is the newest remix from Loki.

1409
01:48:58,060 --> 01:49:13,060
All right, there they are.

1410
01:49:13,060 --> 01:49:14,060
Send your votes now.

1411
01:49:14,060 --> 01:49:17,020
Place vote now.

1412
01:49:17,020 --> 01:49:20,260
Send those over private message to Sky.

1413
01:49:20,260 --> 01:49:25,740
I'm looking at the directory of Loki remixes and it looks like he's got about 12 of them

1414
01:49:25,740 --> 01:49:33,460
now. Almost enough for a CD. Almost. Something. That's alright. I think, actually, why don't

1415
01:49:33,460 --> 01:49:36,380
we play that other Loki mix? Do you want to talk about your other remix that you did this

1416
01:49:36,380 --> 01:49:41,420
week, Loki, that you wanted to debut tonight? I did this one this morning, because, actually,

1417
01:49:41,420 --> 01:49:46,460
it was something that Angel's working on right now, and so I give her credit for the name,

1418
01:49:46,460 --> 01:49:52,100
and DarkTuxedo also came up with the name, and IDA last night, but I just threw one together

1419
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:55,340
to see how it would end up, because they were working on it.

1420
01:49:55,340 --> 01:49:59,020
And so I was like, OK, well, I'll work on my version of it.

1421
01:49:59,020 --> 01:50:01,260
It's QQQ and Quasar.

1422
01:50:01,260 --> 01:50:03,500
They don't really go together, but I just

1423
01:50:03,500 --> 01:50:06,940
figured for the hell of it just to try it and see if it worked.

1424
01:50:06,940 --> 01:50:09,700
And what else is QQQ?

1425
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:11,940
This is QQQ Quasar, I guess.

1426
01:50:11,940 --> 01:50:12,740
Whatever.

1427
01:50:12,740 --> 01:50:14,500
QQQ Quasar.

1428
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:17,380
All right, so this is kind of an idea you ruthlessly stole

1429
01:50:17,380 --> 01:50:19,260
from Angel, basically.

1430
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:21,540
Well, actually, just from the chat room in general.

1431
01:50:21,540 --> 01:50:27,540
I just did it for the holidays, just to see, you know, what it was. I don't know, whatever.

1432
01:50:27,540 --> 01:50:31,540
Alright, let's check this out. This is the other new Loki remix we have today to be with you tonight.

1433
01:50:31,540 --> 01:50:38,540
tonight it's Loki vs. Tack with QQ Quasar.

1434
01:52:01,540 --> 01:52:20,020
Alright, that's the other Loki song we want to debut tonight, Loki vs. Tack with QQ Quasar,

1435
01:52:20,020 --> 01:52:23,980
an idea that was ruthlessly stolen from our chat room, but you did a nice job with it.

1436
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:24,980
Very nice job.

1437
01:52:24,980 --> 01:52:29,100
It's just as some folks are saying, well, Brad, tell listeners what you've been saying

1438
01:52:29,100 --> 01:52:30,100
while that song's playing.

1439
01:52:30,100 --> 01:52:59,100
QQQ would have a lot more potential with this other song, I can't think off the bat what it would mix better with, but still a good effort, I like it.

1440
01:52:59,100 --> 01:53:05,100
No, not electrical parade music, I don't know, maybe you could make it sound good, but we'll see.

1441
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:34,820
electrical parade. It was something like that though. I don't remember exactly what it is,

1442
01:53:34,820 --> 01:53:47,100
but that song would go good with this because it sounds the same. Okay. I'm going to give

1443
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:55,900
a couple more minutes for the cage match votes to come in. In the meantime, gosh, I'm stretched

1444
01:53:55,900 --> 01:54:00,520
for topics to talk about tonight what what's on your what's on your guys's

1445
01:54:00,520 --> 01:54:06,600
mind anything guy related well I've been working on my little thing I didn't get

1446
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:12,160
to meet with Keith this week so that made me mad but I've been working on my

1447
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:19,640
list for this thing that I'm doing and it sucks because I was going on DDR

1448
01:54:19,640 --> 01:54:23,040
maniacs because they're doing they have a threat about remaking banners so

1449
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:27,820
work perfectly for what I'm doing. The thing is is a certain some way that we

1450
01:54:27,820 --> 01:54:31,100
used to know that used to be in our chat room but got banned from our chat room

1451
01:54:31,100 --> 01:54:35,180
went ahead and went and fucked up the DDR maniacs forums so if you take a look

1452
01:54:35,180 --> 01:54:39,360
at DDR maniacs forums you'll see that a certain somebody that goes by the

1453
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:45,540
name Newt decided to take it take a poop on the forums there and fuck them all up

1454
01:55:15,540 --> 01:55:44,700
The next game that will be coming out for itoy is a full on dance game that will have

1455
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:18,820
It's more of a party game like it would be the best thing ever drunk like I could see myself

1456
01:56:19,100 --> 01:56:24,500
Drunk and playing that sparkles mode where all your motion creates little rainbow sparkles on the screen

1457
01:56:24,500 --> 01:56:26,500
I can see that entertaining myself for hours

1458
01:56:26,820 --> 01:56:29,880
That's so a stoner game too. You know with the bubbles

1459
01:56:30,620 --> 01:56:32,620
Oh

1460
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:35,420
Sweet

1461
01:56:36,780 --> 01:56:38,780
It's just like so

1462
01:56:38,820 --> 01:56:40,900
It's just a stoner game

1463
01:56:40,900 --> 01:56:47,440
It's like a game for everyone that you can play this game and no matter what, you know, just find something that you'll enjoy in it

1464
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:52,180
I mean, they've got some pretty fun stuff and they have a mode in there. It's a game. That's just like that

1465
01:56:52,580 --> 01:56:54,580
FantaVision where it's with

1466
01:56:56,300 --> 01:57:00,960
Fireworks the music and that's really good. No, it's kind of neat. I like FantaVision. That's a pretty cool game

1467
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:06,140
They actually made a sequel to that too weird is kind of neat and then they have another game. That's like a kung-fu thing

1468
01:57:06,140 --> 01:57:10,740
That's kind of fun kung-fu. That one's awesome. Yeah. Yeah. I love when you have to break the um

1469
01:57:10,740 --> 01:57:16,160
you have to break the boards. It's just so funny because on the screen you can see yourself

1470
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:22,620
mirrored in doing what you're doing. Everybody, when they break the boards, they're using

1471
01:57:22,620 --> 01:57:25,800
their hands like this. You can't really see it, but they're pointing it straight out like

1472
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:30,060
they're doing a paper and rock, paper, scissors. And they poke it with their fingers. Poke

1473
01:57:30,060 --> 01:57:35,500
the board, and it breaks. And they'll hit it with their elbow. It's good stuff.

1474
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:40,660
The one that was hilarious to me was the Ice Queen was over and he hates spiders more than

1475
01:57:40,660 --> 01:57:46,400
anything and there's a spider thing on there and it's great because what the spiders do

1476
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:51,260
is it puts a bunch of spiders on the screen that are attracted to motion so if you move

1477
01:57:51,260 --> 01:57:53,860
a little bit, the spiders will jump on you really quickly.

1478
01:57:53,860 --> 01:57:54,860
It's so funny.

1479
01:57:54,860 --> 01:57:57,940
They attach their sides to your head and they don't get off.

1480
01:57:57,940 --> 01:58:01,100
It made the Ice Queen run out of the room screaming like the faggie is.

1481
01:58:01,100 --> 01:58:02,100
It was great.

1482
01:58:02,100 --> 01:58:03,100
I loved it.

1483
01:58:03,100 --> 01:58:04,420
Then they have the bees.

1484
01:58:04,420 --> 01:58:05,420
You can play with bees.

1485
01:58:05,420 --> 01:58:06,420
Oh really?

1486
01:58:06,420 --> 01:58:07,420
I didn't see that.

1487
01:58:07,420 --> 01:58:10,100
That's what kids need to learn to play with bees.

1488
01:58:10,100 --> 01:58:11,100
Yeah.

1489
01:58:11,100 --> 01:58:12,100
I did.

1490
01:58:12,100 --> 01:58:13,100
And I paid for it when I was a kid.

1491
01:58:13,100 --> 01:58:17,380
What other ones did they have on there that were pretty funny?

1492
01:58:17,380 --> 01:58:20,140
Garrah's playing with a, they had like a mirror thing.

1493
01:58:20,140 --> 01:58:21,140
It was like a carnival mirror.

1494
01:58:21,140 --> 01:58:22,140
I played with that thing.

1495
01:58:22,140 --> 01:58:23,140
Yeah.

1496
01:58:23,140 --> 01:58:24,140
That was funny.

1497
01:58:24,140 --> 01:58:25,140
The mirror.

1498
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:26,140
Oh yeah.

1499
01:58:26,140 --> 01:58:27,140
The mirror was great.

1500
01:58:27,140 --> 01:58:28,140
So, iToy, good thing, bad thing?

1501
01:58:28,140 --> 01:58:29,140
What the hell is this thing?

1502
01:58:29,140 --> 01:58:30,940
Is it going to go the way of the Super Scope and all these other peripherals that only

1503
01:58:30,940 --> 01:58:33,100
ever had one game out and just died?

1504
01:58:33,100 --> 01:58:40,980
There's no way to know where it's going to go, but I think if we get some imaginative

1505
01:58:40,980 --> 01:58:46,100
game developers to use this peripheral for something else, I think there's some huge

1506
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:47,940
possibilities for this thing.

1507
01:58:47,940 --> 01:58:53,300
If anything, you're going to see it used for a bunch of different applications, not necessarily

1508
01:58:53,300 --> 01:58:55,900
as a full game, but like add-on things.

1509
01:58:55,900 --> 01:59:00,580
For instance, I'm sure they're going to do this, you'll be playing a first person shooter

1510
01:59:00,580 --> 01:59:04,140
and you can take a screencap of your face and post it on your character's face.

1511
01:59:04,140 --> 01:59:07,940
Yeah, that's what I was thinking, mapping the face, your face onto the character's face

1512
01:59:07,940 --> 01:59:11,260
so it gets even more personalized. You can go and kill your friends.

1513
01:59:11,260 --> 01:59:16,260
Yeah, and you could do Para Para with this thing, the more that I think about it. The

1514
01:59:16,260 --> 01:59:21,660
dance game that comes with it is very Para Para-ish. It has sensors in the same space,

1515
01:59:21,660 --> 01:59:26,060
but instead of sensors coming from the ground, it's just measuring where your hands are on

1516
01:59:26,060 --> 01:59:27,900
the cam. You could do Para Para with this thing.

1517
01:59:27,900 --> 01:59:31,160
It's like Parapar, where the five sensors, instead of being in front of you, they're

1518
01:59:31,160 --> 01:59:39,840
above you, like a corona all around you, but it plays, to me, more like Space Channel 5.

1519
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:41,640
You have, she'll do something, and then you have to...

1520
01:59:41,640 --> 01:59:43,640
It plays like Parappa to me, more, well, okay, Space Channel 5.

1521
01:59:43,640 --> 01:59:44,640
No, I can see Space Channel 5.

1522
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:45,800
It's exactly like Space Channel 5.

1523
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:47,040
I can see Space Channel 5.

1524
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:50,160
I was thinking more Parappa, but, yeah, Space Channel 5's probably a better description

1525
01:59:50,160 --> 01:59:51,160
for it.

1526
01:59:51,160 --> 01:59:54,280
And then there's a beat mania, quote unquote, came in there, too, which is the same thing,

1527
01:59:54,280 --> 01:59:57,520
except it's four speakers in the corner, and it has a licensed song in it.

1528
01:59:57,520 --> 02:00:02,520
Singing it back, swing it back, sing it back to me

1529
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:06,520
That game reminds me kind of a little more like Slamade Amigo

1530
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:09,520
Because the things come from the center like Slamade Amigo

1531
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:11,520
And then go to the outside

1532
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:12,520
So yeah, good stuff

1533
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:15,520
I think my favorite game in the whole thing though was the Fantavision one

1534
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:16,520
The fireworks one

1535
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:18,520
Yeah that was cool because the little detonating things on the side

1536
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:19,520
That one's really fun

1537
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:21,520
Touching the fireworks and then BOOM

1538
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:24,520
And the music's great, it's hella like ravery, hard and snowy

1539
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:25,520
It's really good

1540
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:32,160
I love taking the pictures of yourself with little profiles.

1541
02:00:32,160 --> 02:00:37,800
I think if Xbox should do one of these for Xbox Live, they would have a ball with this.

1542
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:42,000
And the greatest thing ever is when they do a picture for the high score.

1543
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:47,080
When you score, you know, top score or whatever, you take a photo and their photo gets stuck

1544
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:48,080
with the high score.

1545
02:00:48,080 --> 02:00:49,080
That's the greatest.

1546
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:50,080
It's funny.

1547
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:52,520
I love how for the profile you get the pictures.

1548
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:55,880
There are three pictures that will tell you the picture of like a, it says do a happy

1549
02:00:55,880 --> 02:00:59,660
face, then a sad face, then a silly face, and so when you go to the profiles to select

1550
02:00:59,660 --> 02:01:03,160
your character you want to play as, like Matt will have his own and Rob will have his own,

1551
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:09,360
it shows their faces changing from like happy, silly, or then they have some really pointless

1552
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:14,080
modes but they're kind of fun even still, like the window washing, oh the window washing,

1553
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:19,720
the weird song in the background, it's like this old 40, when I'm washing windows, it's

1554
02:01:19,720 --> 02:01:23,800
It's like this really hella old 40s or 30s song.

1555
02:01:23,800 --> 02:01:25,800
It's just perfect though, it fits.

1556
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:27,000
Good stuff.

1557
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Yeah.

1558
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,000
Good times.

1559
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Very.

1560
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:36,240
But actually, I remember a long time ago, we were reading up on, they were developing

1561
02:01:36,240 --> 02:01:42,240
a dance dance revolution type thing with motion capturing just like this and I remember looking

1562
02:01:42,240 --> 02:01:43,240
and going, that's stupid.

1563
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:47,720
And you know what, if I think when I see this new dancing game, I think I'll think the exact

1564
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:56,360
the same thing. It'll be stupid. It's a good concept, but it's not for people doing it

1565
02:01:56,360 --> 02:02:01,640
for accuracy, like all the PAers out there. It's not going to work.

1566
02:02:01,640 --> 02:02:07,160
Yeah, it's not super accurate. I was getting kind of frustrated because I felt like I was

1567
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:13,640
hitting it on time, like rhythm and stuff. There's a game in there where it's a mirror

1568
02:02:13,640 --> 02:02:16,960
game where you have to hit these, you have to hit the green ones and not the red ones

1569
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:20,480
where you get penalized, they're like these little bubbles, and what happens is it creates

1570
02:02:20,480 --> 02:02:25,800
like a mirror effect where one half of the screen changes upside down and what not, so

1571
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:31,080
you would expect when you raise your hand to touch it, like it goes in a completely

1572
02:02:31,080 --> 02:02:34,140
opposite, it's hard to explain, you'd have to see it, but the thing is that since you're

1573
02:02:34,140 --> 02:02:40,240
raising your arm, any part of your arm can touch the sensor area on the screen and you

1574
02:02:40,240 --> 02:02:44,240
you fuck yourself up, so it's just not a very accurate type of sentence.

1575
02:02:44,240 --> 02:02:49,240
Or, depending on the lighting in your room, a shadow could set it off.

1576
02:02:49,240 --> 02:02:56,240
Yeah, exactly. It's not the most accurate style of whatnot, you know what I mean?

1577
02:02:56,240 --> 02:03:01,240
What the hell? Oh, there. Okay, anyway.

1578
02:03:01,240 --> 02:03:06,240
Okay, I think it's time to announce the winner of the Orange Launch Cage Match. What do you guys think?

1579
02:03:06,240 --> 02:03:09,240
Here is tonight's winner, the Orange Lounge Cage Match.

1580
02:03:09,240 --> 02:03:12,240
I think this one isn't too difficult to figure out.

1581
02:03:12,240 --> 02:03:15,240
It wasn't unanimous. I thought it would be, but it was not.

1582
02:03:15,240 --> 02:03:18,240
But it was a pretty big landslide nonetheless.

1583
02:03:18,240 --> 02:03:20,240
This is tonight's Cage Match winner.

1584
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:26,240
Battle Without Honor, Humanity, The 88's, Evers, Limbs, Mix, of course.

1585
02:03:28,240 --> 02:03:31,240
Wins tonight's Orange Lounge Cage Match.

1586
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:33,240
You guys cool with that?

1587
02:04:03,240 --> 02:04:10,680
The DDR Megamix that we're going to hear, the artist is credited with DDR and it's all

1588
02:04:10,680 --> 02:04:13,920
these DDR songs mixed together, so we'll hear that.

1589
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:18,040
Good Cool featuring Jeff Koot with Blaster, I promise that one.

1590
02:04:18,040 --> 02:04:20,480
So we're going to hear Blaster this break.

1591
02:04:20,480 --> 02:04:26,140
And you know what, hey Brad, I need your help here.

1592
02:04:26,140 --> 02:04:32,100
Is Iconoclasm, is that the Taka featuring DJW one?

1593
02:04:32,100 --> 02:04:35,400
They totally changed their name, I'm not sure if it's that or not.

1594
02:04:35,400 --> 02:04:36,400
The anthem trance?

1595
02:04:36,400 --> 02:04:37,400
Taka and DJW.

1596
02:04:37,400 --> 02:04:38,400
Taka and DJW.

1597
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:40,140
Okay, we're going to hear that one too.

1598
02:04:40,140 --> 02:04:44,980
The Taka and DJW in the genre of anthem trance, it's Vatam Stelaru.

1599
02:04:44,980 --> 02:04:47,900
And they call themselves iconoclasm, which is why I was thrown off because I couldn't

1600
02:04:47,900 --> 02:04:49,740
remember what they had called themselves.

1601
02:04:49,740 --> 02:04:51,100
So we're going to hear all that this break.

1602
02:04:51,100 --> 02:04:55,300
The DDR Megamix, Good Cool and Jeff Koot, and Taka and W.

1603
02:04:55,300 --> 02:04:57,660
When we come back, the FUs of the week.

1604
02:04:57,660 --> 02:05:04,660
We'll be back.

1605
02:06:27,660 --> 02:06:30,660
I'm telling you I know it's true

1606
02:06:30,660 --> 02:06:34,660
That I'd die for you, die for you

1607
02:06:34,660 --> 02:06:39,660
Baby, let's love, love, love again and again

1608
02:06:39,660 --> 02:06:42,660
Tonight everything's alright

1609
02:06:42,660 --> 02:06:45,660
It's too almost here

1610
02:06:45,660 --> 02:06:48,660
Remember sweet, sweet love

1611
02:07:48,660 --> 02:07:52,660
Life's wire, your powder's dry

1612
02:07:52,660 --> 02:07:56,660
Another fire and I'll blow you sky high

1613
02:07:58,660 --> 02:08:00,660
I'll blow you sky high

1614
02:08:03,660 --> 02:08:06,660
No cues to a sonic boom

1615
02:08:06,660 --> 02:08:10,660
I feel a tremor at shakin' the room

1616
02:08:12,660 --> 02:08:14,660
Shakin' the room

1617
02:08:14,660 --> 02:08:23,660
Everybody, are you ready for the beat back?

1618
02:08:24,660 --> 02:08:30,660
Everybody, are you ready for the master blaster?

1619
02:08:31,660 --> 02:08:35,660
I won't need you where I'm going

1620
02:08:35,660 --> 02:08:43,660
I don't need you, where I'm goin'

1621
02:08:48,660 --> 02:08:53,660
All I'll leave behind is a drain of dust

1622
02:08:53,660 --> 02:09:01,660
All I'll leave behind is a trail of dust

1623
02:09:05,660 --> 02:09:08,660
Are you ready?

1624
02:09:08,660 --> 02:09:15,660
For the master blaster, oh!

1625
02:10:08,660 --> 02:10:13,660
yeah

1626
02:10:13,660 --> 02:10:18,660
yeah

1627
02:10:18,660 --> 02:10:23,660
yeah

1628
02:10:23,660 --> 02:10:28,660
yeah

1629
02:10:28,660 --> 02:10:33,660
yeah

1630
02:12:03,660 --> 02:12:33,460
Hello, we are back and you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 68 in

1631
02:13:03,460 --> 02:13:05,460
Dude, it's like a guy show.

1632
02:13:33,460 --> 02:13:37,620
highlight of DDR it's alright but the thing is is that like do we need to hear

1633
02:13:37,620 --> 02:13:43,980
like before you anymore or d2r or whatever was all those songs in there

1634
02:13:43,980 --> 02:13:47,260
like we've heard those so many times we don't need them again yeah I agree now

1635
02:13:47,260 --> 02:13:52,540
you can make some new before you remix type stuff okay anyway do you have any

1636
02:13:52,540 --> 02:13:58,800
thoughts on that movie it was okay I don't know I just I could see them

1637
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:07,320
putting this in like another version of DDR just as a thing okay cool the other

1638
02:14:07,320 --> 02:14:12,080
song we heard in that break was good cool featuring Jeff coot with blame I'm

1639
02:14:12,080 --> 02:14:20,200
sorry not blame that was their other song this was a blaster what do you guys

1640
02:14:20,200 --> 02:14:27,440
think of blaster I don't know about blaster but hi angel what'd you think of

1641
02:14:27,440 --> 02:14:37,280
I am a huge Jeff Koot fan dude, he makes me warm and gooey inside.

1642
02:14:37,280 --> 02:14:45,980
It's nothing compared to his turning the motor over, or blame, or blowing my heart away,

1643
02:14:45,980 --> 02:14:50,960
but since it's Jeff Koot I'll still deal with the fact that it's stupid hair rock.

1644
02:14:50,960 --> 02:14:53,460
Yeah, it was total butt rock to me.

1645
02:14:53,460 --> 02:14:55,860
It would be good in Guitar Freaks and Drummania.

1646
02:14:55,860 --> 02:14:59,500
It was Total Guitar at My Ass Rock, that's what it was.

1647
02:14:59,500 --> 02:15:03,860
I still say they need to put Roller Coaster of Luck in Fucking Guitar Freak.

1648
02:15:03,860 --> 02:15:04,860
By Jeffy.

1649
02:15:04,860 --> 02:15:05,860
That's true.

1650
02:15:05,860 --> 02:15:11,260
Yeah, I, whatever, I mean, I like the Chili Pepper version, though.

1651
02:15:11,260 --> 02:15:13,900
That's, yeah, that'd be cool, but.

1652
02:15:13,900 --> 02:15:14,900
Yeah.

1653
02:15:14,900 --> 02:15:18,460
And they should have a Be as in Butthead video in the background, because it was in the movie,

1654
02:15:18,460 --> 02:15:19,460
I think.

1655
02:15:19,460 --> 02:15:21,340
Well, I think they were in the, well, the video was animated, I think.

1656
02:15:21,340 --> 02:15:23,340
Yeah, it was, actually, yeah.

1657
02:15:23,340 --> 02:15:24,340
Yeah.

1658
02:15:24,340 --> 02:15:31,340
somebody in the chat room says jeff cooch

1659
02:15:32,500 --> 02:15:37,420
also in that break we heard Taka and DJW coming together as Iconoclasm

1660
02:15:37,420 --> 02:15:40,500
with a song called and this is kind of tricky it's

1661
02:15:40,500 --> 02:15:42,640
Vatum Stellarum

1662
02:15:42,640 --> 02:15:47,760
a little bit of latin there

1663
02:15:47,760 --> 02:15:51,900
what did you think of the Taka and DJW one?

1664
02:15:51,900 --> 02:15:53,780
uh... i like DJ Taka

1665
02:15:53,780 --> 02:16:01,780
But he's been bringing out a lot of more generic stuff lately, and I think he kind of poisoned DJW with that generic-ness he's been bringing out.

1666
02:16:01,780 --> 02:16:04,780
So I'm not blown away by this song, but it is still pretty good.

1667
02:16:04,780 --> 02:16:09,780
It's no Rainbow Flyer, which I think is the best song he's done in a long time.

1668
02:16:09,780 --> 02:16:11,780
Because it has the word rainbow in it.

1669
02:16:11,780 --> 02:16:19,780
Oh, shut up. But it is decent, I guess. But it sounds just like emotion.

1670
02:16:19,780 --> 02:16:25,780
I don't hear DJW really in it at all. If you had just told me it was a DJ Talka song, I would have believed you.

1671
02:16:25,780 --> 02:16:27,780
You would have what?

1672
02:16:27,780 --> 02:16:30,780
I would have believed you if you had just told me it was a DJ Talka song, I would have believed you.

1673
02:16:30,780 --> 02:16:39,780
Well yeah, the DJW part is very subtle. If I can recall, I heard some quick piano-y stuff in there. That's kind of like a DJW thing to do.

1674
02:16:39,780 --> 02:16:43,780
Really fast piano playing is DJW's thing.

1675
02:16:43,780 --> 02:16:45,780
Did you have any thoughts on that, Loki?

1676
02:16:45,780 --> 02:16:50,780
It was okay. I liked it. It sounded kind of trancey and nice.

1677
02:16:50,780 --> 02:16:58,780
I don't know, Taka just hasn't really... I just don't really care about Taka and Tack anymore.

1678
02:16:58,780 --> 02:17:03,780
It's like Tack did better stuff on his album, you know, the remixes, like paranoia and stuff,

1679
02:17:03,780 --> 02:17:08,780
than the actual stuff that he does in, you know, the arcade versions.

1680
02:17:08,780 --> 02:17:11,780
It's like they kind of waste themselves on their albums.

1681
02:17:11,780 --> 02:17:18,040
I think DJ Taka's last really, really good song was Stuff Off, maybe Rainbow Flyer was

1682
02:17:18,040 --> 02:17:19,040
the last really good song.

1683
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:23,000
Like, Fifth Mix was good for both of them, I mean, that was some good stuff.

1684
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:24,000
Was it DR Fifth Mix?

1685
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:25,000
No, Beatmania.

1686
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:26,000
Beatmania Fifth Mix?

1687
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:27,000
Or 2DX, I mean.

1688
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Oh, Fifth Style.

1689
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:29,000
Fifth Style, yeah.

1690
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:30,000
Like, what songs?

1691
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:31,000
I can't...

1692
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:32,000
V?

1693
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Yeah, like, Absolut was on there.

1694
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:37,320
Well, Absolut's from, yeah, Third.

1695
02:17:37,320 --> 02:17:38,320
Whatever.

1696
02:18:08,320 --> 02:18:13,080
That stuff is so generic and repetitive sounding.

1697
02:18:13,080 --> 02:18:14,080
Why does it have to be Naoki Underground?

1698
02:18:14,080 --> 02:18:16,440
Why don't you just say Naoki?

1699
02:18:16,440 --> 02:18:18,720
That's as old as generic as you get right there.

1700
02:18:18,720 --> 02:18:24,520
Well, at least he does different genres of music even though he may put himself under

1701
02:18:24,520 --> 02:18:26,520
different names and stuff.

1702
02:18:26,520 --> 02:18:32,560
Well, DJ Taka's been doing a lot of, like with Night Style, these more J-Poppy sounding

1703
02:18:32,560 --> 02:18:36,200
songs lately, so he's kind of changing up the genre, but I don't think he's doing very

1704
02:18:36,200 --> 02:18:37,200
good.

1705
02:18:37,200 --> 02:18:39,200
Sylvia Drive ever again.

1706
02:18:39,200 --> 02:18:42,200
I was pissed off that they did even Emotion 2003 anyways.

1707
02:18:42,200 --> 02:18:45,200
They've already done a romantic style of Emotion.

1708
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:47,200
That was in, what was it?

1709
02:18:47,200 --> 02:18:48,200
Corey.

1710
02:18:48,200 --> 02:18:51,200
They made romantic style and that was pretty cool.

1711
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:52,200
I like that better than the original.

1712
02:18:52,200 --> 02:18:54,200
But then they're like, we need it to be a little more trancy.

1713
02:18:54,200 --> 02:18:58,200
So let's do romantic 2003 or whatever it's called.

1714
02:18:58,200 --> 02:18:59,200
Lame.

1715
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:02,200
Yeah, I think it was a little overdone.

1716
02:19:02,200 --> 02:19:04,200
So what are we talking about?

1717
02:19:04,200 --> 02:19:08,200
Well, you guys are having an argument about whether Taka sold out or not, or whatever it is.

1718
02:19:08,200 --> 02:19:09,200
Well, I think Taka's just getting soft.

1719
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:10,200
Alright.

1720
02:19:10,200 --> 02:19:14,200
Okay, let's do the FUs of the Week then, speaking of ranting about things.

1721
02:19:14,200 --> 02:19:15,200
I'll leave now.

1722
02:19:15,200 --> 02:19:17,200
It's time for the FUs of the Week.

1723
02:19:23,200 --> 02:19:25,200
Oh, look at that.

1724
02:19:25,200 --> 02:19:26,200
Here is justice.

1725
02:19:26,200 --> 02:19:28,200
Here is punishment.

1726
02:19:28,200 --> 02:19:30,200
Here is...

1727
02:19:30,200 --> 02:19:32,200
This is fucked up.

1728
02:19:32,200 --> 02:19:37,880
Well, this is the part where Jamie would usually do her FUs, because this is her little retarded

1729
02:19:37,880 --> 02:19:44,120
baby that has grown into an hour-long segment every week's show, but she didn't send me

1730
02:19:44,120 --> 02:19:49,240
anything over mail, or I haven't gotten anything on email, and I didn't get a phone call or

1731
02:19:49,240 --> 02:19:50,240
anything.

1732
02:19:50,240 --> 02:19:52,920
So, FU to Jamie for not sending me FUs!

1733
02:19:52,920 --> 02:19:54,920
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we'd miss you.

1734
02:19:54,920 --> 02:19:55,920
I'll do Jamie's.

1735
02:19:55,920 --> 02:19:56,920
Alright.

1736
02:19:56,920 --> 02:20:00,920
Fuck you to traffic, fuck you to being sick, fuck you to Xbox, there you go.

1737
02:20:00,920 --> 02:20:07,920
Fuck you to bad Chinese food, fuck you to Roswell Golf Land children.

1738
02:20:30,920 --> 02:20:35,120
Christmas music is even worse, because I hate Christmas music. Why the hell does every

1739
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:40,200
store in the face of the earth have to play goddamn Christmas music like right after fucking

1740
02:20:40,200 --> 02:20:47,200
Halloween, okay? It's not Christmas yet. I hate that fucking music. Stupid dance media

1741
02:20:49,360 --> 02:20:54,000
is... What is the draw with speed music? Why do people like speed music? It's just like

1742
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:58,600
a song crammed down your throat. It's like fucking taking a beer bong and filling it

1743
02:20:58,600 --> 02:21:03,840
music and that's what it is you're engulfing the whole song in like a few

1744
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:07,980
seconds but no you know instead of having the songs nice and short they

1745
02:21:07,980 --> 02:21:12,160
have to know make extended versions and just speed them twice as fast of their

1746
02:21:12,160 --> 02:21:21,600
regular size your boss hey now you're a rock star get your game on oh sorry

1747
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:28,600
My second F.U. of the week is going to be going to G4 for their poor programming.

1748
02:21:28,600 --> 02:21:35,600
I watched a nice segment on Dance Dance Revolution and these people covering it knew nothing about the game.

1749
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:37,600
I don't think anything knew what they were doing there.

1750
02:21:37,600 --> 02:21:39,600
They were talking to these people asking them,

1751
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:41,600
So, what's your highest score?

1752
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:43,600
And the guy's looking at them like,

1753
02:21:43,600 --> 02:21:46,600
What the hell? What are you? Huh?

1754
02:21:46,600 --> 02:21:50,600
He just had a confused look on his face and it was just awful.

1755
02:21:50,600 --> 02:21:56,600
Also, FU, that stupid game Tetris Worlds, not every game needs to have a story.

1756
02:21:56,600 --> 02:22:02,600
Tetris is not meant to have a story. It is a puzzle game. No story needed, you play the game.

1757
02:22:02,600 --> 02:22:05,600
Dude, have you seen the new Tetris game? Aeris dies.

1758
02:22:05,600 --> 02:22:12,600
It's just stupid, it's like, we have to recolonize our planet. It's not a planet, it's a puzzle game.

1759
02:22:12,600 --> 02:22:16,600
Puzzle game. No need for anything else.

1760
02:22:16,600 --> 02:22:23,600
2. Who wants to watch Russell Crowe be a stupid sailor?

1761
02:22:46,600 --> 02:22:51,600
kostjamrh No, that's not worth saying.

1762
02:23:16,600 --> 02:23:42,600
I hate them to hell and old people just really suck. I hate reality TV because these new shows that they come up with like this stupid bitch that has to marry some ugly guy. I don't really care if she has to marry an ugly guy because you know what? Ugly people are all over the world and people get married every day. So there's ugly people getting married to hot people all the time.

1763
02:23:42,600 --> 02:23:47,600
quackparty2...

1764
02:24:12,600 --> 02:24:18,880
also just they have like studies about like different things like games are

1765
02:24:18,880 --> 02:24:27,720
addictive you know that's it it's really lame like this is what I'm saying if you set

1766
02:24:27,720 --> 02:24:35,240
fire to yourself it will hurt so I'm done

1767
02:24:35,240 --> 02:24:41,200
I like boobies too but just because I like boobies doesn't mean you have to

1768
02:24:41,200 --> 02:24:48,200
keep writing movies

1769
02:24:51,420 --> 02:24:54,760
and burn this fucking CD

1770
02:24:54,760 --> 02:24:59,760
they sent you Beethoven

1771
02:24:59,760 --> 02:25:01,680

1772
02:25:01,680 --> 02:25:06,180
think of something else real fast i'm dealing with some things in the chatroom hold on

1773
02:25:06,180 --> 02:25:13,180
Let's watch some gay porn so we can get our hate back.

1774
02:25:36,180 --> 02:25:41,180
The only spam I get is TUBGIRL!

1775
02:26:11,180 --> 02:26:12,180
What's your email?

1776
02:26:12,180 --> 02:26:15,340
I, well, I'm not going to give it out over the air, because who knows, and everybody's

1777
02:26:15,340 --> 02:26:18,180
going to send me Tug Girl, because they think it'll be funny.

1778
02:26:18,180 --> 02:26:21,180
Okay, everybody, go to www.goatsay.cx.

1779
02:26:21,180 --> 02:26:30,220
Jesus Christ, just kill your, oh, that's it, my turn, my turn.

1780
02:26:30,220 --> 02:26:34,260
My old few of the week goes to these fucking retarded internet jokes that are five years

1781
02:26:34,260 --> 02:26:35,260
old.

1782
02:26:35,260 --> 02:26:42,260
Hey, go to Goatsay, it's funny. This guy is stretching his ass.

1783
02:26:42,260 --> 02:26:43,260
God.

1784
02:26:43,260 --> 02:26:49,260
Top Girl, oh, it's so funny. Hey, she shit herself, isn't that great? Look at that.

1785
02:26:49,260 --> 02:26:52,260
God, shut the fuck up.

1786
02:26:52,260 --> 02:26:59,260
If you're going to send around an internet joke, at least make it a funny internet joke, like Ghetto Barbie or whatever that once came out.

1787
02:26:59,260 --> 02:27:08,260
No, I'm sorry. I know a lot of people hate it still, but you can't go wrong with All Your Base. It's a classic. It's the original.

1788
02:27:08,260 --> 02:27:12,260
This is funny because Japanese people actually wrote this this way.

1789
02:27:12,260 --> 02:27:16,260
All Your Base was not part of my F.U. That can stay.

1790
02:27:16,260 --> 02:27:17,260
Okay, thank you.

1791
02:27:17,260 --> 02:27:19,260
But Don't Say and all this other stuff has to go.

1792
02:27:19,260 --> 02:27:21,260
Yes, that's done.

1793
02:27:21,260 --> 02:27:23,260
Or at least come up with something else funny.

1794
02:27:23,260 --> 02:27:29,980
Well, there's like, you know, how about how about a woman in a new compromising position or a guy doing another amazing thing to her body?

1795
02:27:33,580 --> 02:27:36,140
Okay, send me that no one sent me that yet

1796
02:27:36,780 --> 02:27:42,440
There's there's the new fetish where women kick guys full-on in the groin really hard and they get off on it

1797
02:27:42,440 --> 02:27:47,980
That'll probably be a new joke. Yes, somebody send me bum fights. I haven't seen this yet. It might still be funny. See?

1798
02:27:49,740 --> 02:27:51,740
All right, God

1799
02:27:51,740 --> 02:28:00,660
I just hate it when people post this on forums to try to, like, there's something new that

1800
02:28:00,660 --> 02:28:03,500
you're like, huh, this is so funny, my friend just showed it to me.

1801
02:28:03,500 --> 02:28:08,380
Chances are, if your friend just showed it to you, it's like five years old, your friend's

1802
02:28:08,380 --> 02:28:09,380
just retarded.

1803
02:28:09,380 --> 02:28:10,380
Unless you're mean.

1804
02:28:10,380 --> 02:28:12,380
Have you seen part putting?

1805
02:28:12,380 --> 02:28:15,840
No, God, I don't want to.

1806
02:28:15,840 --> 02:28:20,540
My favorite ones are the ones where they post stuff like about new DDR extreme skin for

Fuck you to stupid customers that come into games, stop asking about six billion video

1816
02:29:58,860 --> 02:30:02,260
games, and have them tell you everything that's new, and then they decide they don't want

1817
02:30:02,260 --> 02:30:03,260
that game.

1818
02:30:03,260 --> 02:30:05,380
They want Halo for the Xbox.

1819
02:30:05,380 --> 02:30:08,160
Fuck you to stupid people, bad drivers.

1820
02:30:08,160 --> 02:30:09,160
Fuck you to angry drivers.

1821
02:30:09,160 --> 02:30:11,460
Don't know what I'm talking about if you're listening.

1822
02:30:11,460 --> 02:30:12,460
Sorry, princess.

1823
02:30:12,460 --> 02:30:16,460
Fuck you to computer viruses.

1824
02:30:16,460 --> 02:30:22,460
Fuck you to people who are getting a nice new laptop and are getting a 59 inch TV.

1825
02:30:22,460 --> 02:30:24,460
Fuck you.

02:30:24,460 --> 02:30:27,460

This group is called Movie Gallery.

1832
02:30:39,460 --> 02:31:07,460
Vambulus, your FUs. Do you have any FUs of the week?

1833
02:31:09,460 --> 02:31:14,980
I like to outsource everything to India, to save money, they put all people out of jobs

1834
02:31:14,980 --> 02:31:15,980
and they all wander around.

1835
02:31:15,980 --> 02:31:21,260
It makes it nice for when I'm hiring, but it still sucks when people are out of jobs.

1836
02:31:21,260 --> 02:31:28,940
If you do lots of bills, if you do triple car tax, my truck tax bill came in this month

1837
02:31:28,940 --> 02:31:30,940
and I owe $600.

1838
02:31:30,940 --> 02:31:32,940
Oh my God!

1839
02:31:32,940 --> 02:31:35,940
Yep, it tripled.

1840
02:31:35,940 --> 02:31:39,940
If it's tripled, Square Brides Princesses is tripled.

1841
02:31:39,940 --> 02:31:42,940
How about...

1842
02:31:42,940 --> 02:31:44,940
That's all I have, because I can't think of anything.

1843
02:31:44,940 --> 02:31:45,940
Alright, fair enough.

1844
02:31:45,940 --> 02:31:49,940
Bradley, Arkadian42, what are your FUs of the week?

1845
02:31:49,940 --> 02:31:55,940
Fuck you to be on the edge of out of money and all that other stuff and various things like that as usual.

1846
02:31:55,940 --> 02:31:57,940
Fuck you to not have any dog yet.

1847
02:31:57,940 --> 02:31:58,940
Fuck you to my laziest...

1848
02:31:58,940 --> 02:32:01,940
We're not getting the dog yet.

1849
02:32:01,940 --> 02:32:03,940
Fuck you to bad drivers of course.

1850
02:32:03,940 --> 02:32:07,460
The guy always tried to hit me when he was chasing lanes, but I think the cops caught

1851
02:32:07,460 --> 02:32:12,460
him saying, fuck you to him, and thank you to the cops for catching that idiot, uh, fuck

1852
02:32:12,460 --> 02:32:17,460
you to disappearing pencils, and he just ran away from me and disappeared to different

1853
02:32:17,460 --> 02:32:22,460
rooms saying, where do the people go to when they have, like, more pencils than they disappear

1854
02:32:22,460 --> 02:32:30,460
in various ways, and, uh, work, and, uh, say it again.

1855
02:32:30,460 --> 02:32:34,460
Hey, um, up next, let's hear from Zero, your FUs of the Week.

1856
02:33:00,460 --> 02:33:04,460
It didn't matter because I wanted to get out of it. I needed to take a break anyway.

1857
02:33:04,460 --> 02:33:09,460
Um, uh, because we were out.

1858
02:33:09,460 --> 02:33:16,460
Um, yeah, fuck you to having a car now because I have to go and fucking park all the way at Cal Expo

1859
02:33:16,460 --> 02:33:23,460
because the stupid fucking mall security little fucking police squad dropouts

1860
02:33:23,460 --> 02:33:26,460
come up and harass our store specifically and tell us

1861
02:33:26,460 --> 02:33:30,460
If you park your cars anywhere else with Calitro, we're gonna tow it.

1862
02:33:30,460 --> 02:33:33,460
And they're, like, picking on us, so we're making their job harder.

1863
02:33:35,460 --> 02:33:42,460
Yes, and fuck you to people who tell me to fuck you because I'm getting, like, a TV and a computer.

1864
02:33:42,460 --> 02:33:45,460
You know what? Those are gifts. Dick.

1865
02:33:45,460 --> 02:33:47,460
Anyways...

1866
02:33:47,460 --> 02:33:50,460
Jason! You're a dick!

1867
02:33:50,460 --> 02:33:55,460
And by the way, that stuff that I'm getting is a gift, so fuck off.

1868
02:33:55,460 --> 02:34:00,460
Not like you don't get to benefit from it anyway, so shut up.

1869
02:34:25,460 --> 02:34:30,460
p0k3smot42o you can have a line sugi

1870
02:34:55,460 --> 02:34:56,460
Oh wow.

1871
02:34:56,460 --> 02:34:57,460
Alright.

1872
02:34:57,460 --> 02:34:58,460
FUs please.

1873
02:34:58,460 --> 02:35:03,460
Okay, uh, of course the old classic FU does this segment, it's stupid, um, and to be the

1874
02:35:03,460 --> 02:35:06,460
great hypocrisy type thing, you know, I'll go ahead and give another FU.

1875
02:35:06,460 --> 02:35:12,020
FU to you people who complain about G4, at least you got the money to or have G4, like

1876
02:35:12,020 --> 02:35:16,980
and have cable, cause I have to watch the same three channels over and over again.

1877
02:35:16,980 --> 02:35:20,140
Thank you network local television.

1878
02:35:20,140 --> 02:35:24,500
But then again I do get at least CSI and cheaters.

1879
02:35:24,500 --> 02:35:25,500
What's this?

1880
02:35:25,500 --> 02:35:26,500
Hell yeah.

1881
02:35:26,500 --> 02:35:32,060
Fuck both of you because my TV doesn't even get the reception for those three channels.

1882
02:35:32,060 --> 02:35:36,940
Mine doesn't, my TV doesn't, but they have like this little cable thing that's an antenna

1883
02:35:36,940 --> 02:35:41,060
that's like this huge, supposed to be a huge antenna on top of the whole apartment complex,

1884
02:35:41,060 --> 02:35:42,260
but you know what I think it is?

1885
02:35:42,260 --> 02:35:46,740
It's just like a piece of tin foil that's attached to this cable because I cannot get

1886
02:35:46,740 --> 02:35:52,080
Fox, like hardly ever, which sucks because Fox has like I think Simpsons on it and stuff

1887
02:35:52,080 --> 02:35:59,080
and

1888
02:35:59,580 --> 02:36:02,300
but anyhow

1889
02:36:02,300 --> 02:36:06,540
doesn't work for is awesome

1890
02:36:06,540 --> 02:36:08,760
but seriously man

1892
02:36:16,520 --> 02:36:17,160

02:36:17,160 --> 02:36:18,000

1894
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:18,980
picture

1895
02:36:18,980 --> 02:36:28,980
If you liked this video, please like, share, and subscribe!

1896
02:37:18,980 --> 02:37:25,980
I have a little man!

1897
02:37:48,980 --> 02:37:52,660
What do they know just kidding just kidding just kidding if you lose it what?

1898
02:37:56,900 --> 02:38:01,900
Just scares me with pictures of Kelly Osbourne, and why why does he have them on his computer? That's what I want to know

1899
02:38:01,900 --> 02:38:04,660
Oh my god. It's a new picture of Kelly Osbourne

1900
02:38:05,180 --> 02:38:08,780
I accidentally downloaded her album because it came up as such an elf

1901
02:38:10,940 --> 02:38:17,340
You guys are so gullible like three guys took up the gym. Oh my god. You'd picture Kelly Osbourne. She's like 17 you perverts

1902
02:38:17,340 --> 02:38:21,340
That's exactly why I want to see it.

1903
02:38:21,340 --> 02:38:25,340
Dude, it's like fruit. You want it just before it's ripe and ready to be eaten.

1904
02:38:25,340 --> 02:38:29,340
Oh my God!

1905
02:38:29,340 --> 02:38:33,340
She got

1906
02:38:33,340 --> 02:38:37,340
ripe a little early, okay?

1907
02:38:37,340 --> 02:38:41,340
DJ Specter would like to say, F you, my stupid Spanish teacher

1908
02:38:41,340 --> 02:38:45,340
whose name I can't pronounce, I'm not going to try to, and DJ Specter would like to give

1909
02:38:45,340 --> 02:38:52,340
darceus u would like to second the f u of the week to christmas speed

1910
02:39:45,340 --> 02:39:47,340
I got the F.U. Depaltaire. I guess that was it.

1911
02:39:47,340 --> 02:39:49,340
Can I get one more?

1912
02:39:49,340 --> 02:39:55,340
Baca wants to give an F.U. to a family member who will not let him listen to the rest of the show.

1913
02:39:55,340 --> 02:39:58,340
So it did me no good to read that because he's not listening anymore.

1914
02:39:58,340 --> 02:40:00,340
That's too bad.

1915
02:40:00,340 --> 02:40:05,340
Nothing comes between you and your Orange Lounge radio, God damn it.

1916
02:40:05,340 --> 02:40:06,340
All right.

1917
02:40:06,340 --> 02:40:08,340
That's it. We're done with the F.U.s of the week.

1918
02:40:08,340 --> 02:40:11,340
Don't send me more. I don't want to hear them.

1919
02:40:11,340 --> 02:40:16,340
Alright, we're going to do another break of Poppin' Music 10 stuff.

1920
02:40:16,340 --> 02:40:17,340
So here it is.

1921
02:40:17,340 --> 02:40:19,460
In this break you're going to hear, I know a lot of you guys have been looking forward

1922
02:40:19,460 --> 02:40:22,140
to this one, the Dez Q and Tac song.

1923
02:40:22,140 --> 02:40:27,140
Dez Q with Jack is the first song we're going to hear.

1924
02:40:27,140 --> 02:40:31,100
And we're going to hear Girls Band, it's a genre called Girls Band.

1925
02:40:31,100 --> 02:40:32,420
It's Milk.

1926
02:40:32,420 --> 02:40:33,420
Kind of like the character.

1927
02:40:33,420 --> 02:40:34,420
Milk.

1928
02:40:34,420 --> 02:40:37,300
Threep with Milk and then we're going to hear another Dez Q song because I know they have

1929
02:40:37,300 --> 02:40:39,860
so many fanboys and girls thanks to Dyke and Kai.

1930
02:40:39,860 --> 02:40:45,860
We'll hear another Dez Row song featuring Shingon with the place to be, and it's a genre

1931
02:40:45,860 --> 02:40:46,860
called Core Groove.

1932
02:40:46,860 --> 02:40:51,140
So enjoy this new set of pop music, 10 music, starting with Dez Q.

1933
02:40:51,140 --> 02:40:58,140
You're listening to Orange Launch Radio. Thanks!

1934
02:41:21,140 --> 02:41:36,140
I need to take one, to take many more Souls, the rage, I can't bear it, can't make it grow

1935
02:41:36,140 --> 02:41:40,140
Don't let me down, this is a dream life

1936
02:41:40,140 --> 02:41:42,140
I can't shake you anymore

1937
02:42:42,140 --> 02:43:08,060
Oh, I don't know how to own

1938
02:43:08,060 --> 02:43:27,940
Gada logan genki ni narutame ni okihima wai sakashini ugu

1939
02:43:27,940 --> 02:43:34,940
Do-gi-do-gi, yo-i-mi-chi-si-te

1940
02:43:34,940 --> 02:43:41,940
Kon-e koto, jare-a atari

1941
02:43:41,940 --> 02:43:45,940
I've been waiting for you

1942
02:43:45,940 --> 02:43:49,940
I'll never see you again

1943
02:43:49,940 --> 02:43:56,940
I'll never see you again

1944
02:43:58,940 --> 02:44:02,940
If I had you, I wouldn't have had you

1945
02:44:02,940 --> 02:44:06,940
If I had you, I wouldn't have had you

1946
02:46:36,940 --> 02:46:43,940
Mr. Random person on the street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think

1947
02:47:06,940 --> 02:47:09,940
What do you think of the Orange Lounge Big Money Music and More show?

1948
02:47:09,940 --> 02:47:16,940
The music is like being transported to this dancing spaceship place.

1949
02:47:16,940 --> 02:47:22,940
It's unearthly. It's like being at a club, except you don't have to ask someone to dance.

1950
02:47:22,940 --> 02:47:25,940
Alright, we're back on Orange Lounge Radio.

1951
02:47:25,940 --> 02:47:30,940
I'm opening up the floor for some quick Ask Orange Lounge before we go off air tonight.

1952
02:47:30,940 --> 02:47:34,940
But first, while you guys send those questions in over private message to Sky,

1953
02:47:34,940 --> 02:47:38,140
Let's see what you guys thought of those songs.

1954
02:47:38,140 --> 02:47:40,580
The Chat Room certainly had some strong opinion on these.

1955
02:47:40,580 --> 02:47:44,700
The first song we heard in that break was Dez Q, that's Dez Row and Tac, with a song

1956
02:47:44,700 --> 02:47:45,700
called Jack.

1957
02:47:45,700 --> 02:47:52,700
Um, Brad, what did you think of that?

1958
02:47:52,700 --> 02:47:54,780
The Dez Q with Jack.

1959
02:47:54,780 --> 02:47:55,780
I like it.

1960
02:47:55,780 --> 02:47:58,580
It's distress and freaking gravity mixed together.

1961
02:47:58,580 --> 02:47:59,580
You know what's interesting?

1962
02:47:59,580 --> 02:48:02,540
The Chat Room worst reviews of the night.

1963
02:48:02,540 --> 02:48:04,060
They said that song is god-awful.

1964
02:48:04,060 --> 02:48:12,540
don't like it at all. Fuck them. This shit isn't for them. Big fuck you to the chat room.

1965
02:48:12,540 --> 02:48:20,100
You know what? I don't think it's awful, but for TAC, it's pretty bad. I expect better

1966
02:48:20,100 --> 02:48:30,180
from TAC. So that's me personally. Why don't you go sit on a dick or two? If I could. Oh,

1967
02:48:30,180 --> 02:48:35,180
Oh, oh, hey, it looks like, uh, Bunch of When I Lost was offering.

1968
02:48:35,180 --> 02:48:36,180
I'll close my eyes.

1969
02:48:36,180 --> 02:48:39,180
Uh, Loki, what'd you think of Dez Q?

1970
02:48:39,180 --> 02:48:45,180
It's okay, it's just like every other fucking tax song on the face of the earth, they all sound the same now.

1971
02:48:45,180 --> 02:48:50,180
Um, I should remix it, I guess. That'd be fun.

1972
02:48:50,180 --> 02:48:51,180
Alright.

1973
02:48:51,180 --> 02:48:56,180
Uh, anybody else have a thought on Dez Q with Jack?

1974
02:48:56,180 --> 02:48:57,180
What?

1975
02:48:57,180 --> 02:48:59,180
I should just listen to Captain Jack.

1976
02:48:59,180 --> 02:49:01,680
Yes, Captain Jack is much better than Jack, in my opinion.

1977
02:49:01,680 --> 02:49:03,680
It does queue with Captain Jack.

1978
02:49:03,680 --> 02:49:05,180
Oh!

1979
02:49:05,180 --> 02:49:07,180
Oh!

1980
02:49:07,180 --> 02:49:09,680
The next song we heard was a band called Threep,

1981
02:49:09,680 --> 02:49:13,180
and the song was called Milk.

1982
02:49:13,180 --> 02:49:16,180
A nice, happy little uplifting song.

1983
02:49:16,180 --> 02:49:18,180
I remember that movie.

1984
02:49:18,180 --> 02:49:20,180
Anyway, that was Milk Money.

1985
02:49:20,180 --> 02:49:22,680
Where they, like, saved up their milk money to go to a prostitute.

1986
02:49:22,680 --> 02:49:26,180
That was cool.

1987
02:49:26,180 --> 02:49:30,680
That has nothing to do with the song. Nothing at all, Loki.

1988
02:49:30,680 --> 02:49:34,180
Uh, Brad, did you have a thought on Girls Band With Milk?

1989
02:49:34,180 --> 02:49:36,180
I wasn't paying attention to that song, sorry.

1990
02:49:36,180 --> 02:49:43,180
Well, what the fuck? Pay attention.

1991
02:49:43,180 --> 02:49:48,680
Alright, um, let's see what you guys thought of Desrow featuring Shingon with, uh...

1992
02:49:48,680 --> 02:49:50,180
Oh, what the hell's the name of this song?

1993
02:49:50,180 --> 02:49:51,980
The Place To Be!

1994
02:49:51,980 --> 02:49:54,740
and the certainly those you that were visiting the money stop for a while

1995
02:49:54,740 --> 02:49:59,260
probably got fucking sick of this song really fast yep it's just a few of the

1996
02:49:59,260 --> 02:50:01,380
whole thing

1997
02:50:01,380 --> 02:50:03,540
uh... you say it

1998
02:50:03,540 --> 02:50:07,300
well after that reason only met up and i forgot some

1999
02:50:07,300 --> 02:50:10,580
fuck you but my server so the music on your opening page

2000
02:50:10,580 --> 02:50:12,580
yep they hate you know what

2001
02:50:12,580 --> 02:50:14,120
i love the money style

2002
02:50:14,120 --> 02:50:17,900
got a good guy that runs it can i ask you how i think that's a great site good

2003
02:50:17,900 --> 02:50:19,420
stuff but i don't like that

2004
02:50:19,420 --> 02:50:24,040
choice to put the music on the opening page and the biggest problem is if it

2005
02:50:24,040 --> 02:50:27,280
would be nice here's a suggestion for my spell folks if you're listening instead

2006
02:50:27,280 --> 02:50:31,160
of having the one song in there and changing it every two weeks or so put

2007
02:50:31,160 --> 02:50:35,920
like ten songs that randomize so every time I heard that no better yet turn off

2008
02:50:35,920 --> 02:50:39,560
the fucking music I get it do it do you know maniacs did it's it's got like a

2009
02:50:39,560 --> 02:50:44,620
cookie on your computer okay you if you disable it it doesn't play until you

2010
02:50:44,620 --> 02:50:48,340
enable it again and it does it automatically and I love that otherwise

2011
02:50:48,340 --> 02:50:53,340
nice, great sight. Or even better, just have it load Orange Lounge Radio when they go to

2012
02:50:53,340 --> 02:50:57,100
the front page. Just have it load. The problem is the thing to turn it off, it takes a while

2013
02:50:57,100 --> 02:51:03,940
to load up after no animations and stuff. Bad business decision, whoever did that. Brad,

2014
02:51:03,940 --> 02:51:11,020
what did you think of that song? The Desiro, core groove genre one that got played the

2015
02:51:11,020 --> 02:51:15,580
hell out on the Monty style? What did you think of the last half of it that you didn't

2016
02:51:45,580 --> 02:51:47,580
I think I'm bored too.

2017
02:52:15,580 --> 02:52:17,580
e-mail me

2018
02:52:45,580 --> 02:52:53,660
Don't email Konami, they have a request on their website, click here to request a song

2019
02:52:53,660 --> 02:52:54,660
for your donation.

2020
02:52:54,660 --> 02:52:59,740
Here's the thing, if you really want to do it, try and get a hold of Short EMC or Shintenshi

2021
02:52:59,740 --> 02:53:05,420
or any of those other old school Bay Area MGL guys from DDR, because they all work for

2022
02:53:05,420 --> 02:53:09,820
fucking Konami right now, at least until like Christmas time because I hear they're getting

2023
02:53:09,820 --> 02:53:10,820
laid off.

2024
02:53:10,820 --> 02:53:13,060
But hey, while you're working there, why does Mo bug the shit out of them?

2025
02:53:13,060 --> 02:53:17,940
My only thought is that if you're going to request a song like that, like the total gibberish

2026
02:53:17,940 --> 02:53:24,980
song to be in Karaoke Revolution, Murmur Twins isn't funny.

2027
02:53:24,980 --> 02:53:26,320
I think they're trying to be funny.

2028
02:53:26,320 --> 02:53:30,240
I get the thing that it's trying to be funny, like, ooh, teehee, let's request Murmur Twins.

2029
02:53:30,240 --> 02:53:31,240
It's not funny.

2030
02:53:31,240 --> 02:53:35,660
Wouldn't it have been more funny to request Last Message, or?

2031
02:53:35,660 --> 02:53:37,820
See, yes, Last Message I think would have been a little funny.

2032
02:53:37,820 --> 02:53:38,820
Murmur Twins, not funny.

2033
02:53:38,820 --> 02:53:41,360
I'd like to request DMX be put in DDR.

2034
02:53:41,360 --> 02:53:44,920
I'd like to request that no Bamani songs be put in Karaoke Revolution so that we don't

2035
02:53:44,920 --> 02:53:45,920
ruin the series.

2036
02:53:45,920 --> 02:53:47,920
DMX, the singer, the rapper.

2037
02:53:47,920 --> 02:53:49,320
No, I'm just saying.

2038
02:53:49,320 --> 02:53:51,800
What the fuck are you talking about?

2039
02:53:51,800 --> 02:53:58,720
Am I the only person who agrees that Konami's original music is better than 98% of the music

2040
02:53:58,720 --> 02:53:59,720
that comes out nowadays?

2041
02:53:59,720 --> 02:54:02,920
All I'm saying is that DDR music needs to stay in DDR.

2042
02:54:02,920 --> 02:54:03,920
Check this shit out.

2043
02:54:03,920 --> 02:54:04,920
DDR music needs to stay in DDR.

2044
02:54:04,920 --> 02:54:06,300
It does not need to be in Karaoke Revolution.

2045
02:54:06,300 --> 02:54:08,660
We like Karaoke Revolution because it has the pop songs in it.

2046
02:54:08,660 --> 02:54:09,660
Check this out.

2047
02:54:09,660 --> 02:54:15,660
A new version of Somba Money Game comes out, DDR, pop and music, or 2DX.

2048
02:54:15,660 --> 02:54:18,660
People go, have you heard the new license tracks?

2049
02:54:18,660 --> 02:54:22,660
I'm like, what, there's license tracks? I don't give a fuck. I like Konami's music.

2050
02:54:22,660 --> 02:54:23,660
I like the license tracks.

2051
02:54:23,660 --> 02:54:25,660
Yeah, because you're a consumer whore.

2052
02:54:25,660 --> 02:54:27,660
Fuck off.

2053
02:54:27,660 --> 02:54:30,660
Alright, can we actually answer the questions now?

2054
02:54:30,660 --> 02:54:33,660
Hey, can I ask a question to the chatroom first?

2055
02:54:33,660 --> 02:54:34,660
Yeah.

2056
02:54:34,660 --> 02:54:39,660
Could I have everyone in the chat room who plays FF11 to please tell us what server they're on and their character name?

2057
02:54:39,660 --> 02:54:40,660
I'm on Bismarck.

2058
02:54:40,660 --> 02:54:44,660
Oh, Bismarck. Fuck Bismarck. Everyone jump over to Ragnarok.

2059
02:54:44,660 --> 02:54:47,660
Fuck Ragnarok. There's already a game called Ragnarok.

2060
02:54:47,660 --> 02:54:49,660
Yeah, well, there was a...

2061
02:54:49,660 --> 02:54:53,660
Yeah, and fuck Ragnarok while we're at it.

2062
02:54:53,660 --> 02:54:55,660
Yes, Ben?

2063
02:54:55,660 --> 02:54:56,660
I don't know.

2064
02:54:56,660 --> 02:54:58,660
Alright, let's get to the question.

2065
02:54:58,660 --> 02:54:59,660
No, too late.

2066
02:54:59,660 --> 02:55:03,660
Same question came from both 20th Magus and Zodiac Knight.

2067
02:55:03,660 --> 02:55:08,340
Plus you to the player in Star Wars Galaxy who unlocked the first Jedi.

2068
02:55:08,340 --> 02:55:10,180
You fucking grinding bastard.

2069
02:55:10,180 --> 02:55:12,080
You like mastered every profession in the game.

2070
02:55:12,080 --> 02:55:13,860
You suck ass.

2071
02:55:13,860 --> 02:55:18,300
And fuck you to Sony online for making that the secret way to unlocking the goddamn Jedi

2072
02:55:18,300 --> 02:55:19,300
character.

2073
02:55:19,300 --> 02:55:20,300
Jealous?

2074
02:55:20,300 --> 02:55:21,300
Table of one?

2075
02:55:21,300 --> 02:55:22,300
Jealous?

2076
02:55:22,300 --> 02:55:25,580
No, fuck that fucking piss off because it was just about grinding profession.

2077
02:55:25,580 --> 02:55:28,720
It wasn't some super secret- I thought you enjoyed grinding.

2078
02:55:28,720 --> 02:55:30,380
I do.

2079
02:55:30,380 --> 02:55:36,020
your profession is when you just sit there and build biological chemical effectors all

2080
02:55:36,020 --> 02:55:39,980
day long instead of actually playing the game. You just sit there building things forever.

2081
02:55:39,980 --> 02:55:43,740
And it sucked because it was supposed to be some kind of cool, different way for everyone

2082
02:55:43,740 --> 02:55:46,740
to unlock the AI and it was just mastery of four different professions.

2083
02:55:46,740 --> 02:55:56,740
I don't give a shit. I don't get a few segments done. Alright, same question from Magus and

2084
02:55:56,740 --> 02:55:58,740
zodiacknight asks the same question

2085
02:55:58,740 --> 02:56:00,740
best song in karaoke revolution so far?

2086
02:56:00,740 --> 02:56:02,740
they want to know

2087
02:56:02,740 --> 02:56:04,740
zeroesaysnone

2088
02:56:04,740 --> 02:56:06,740
loki

2089
02:56:06,740 --> 02:56:08,740
you're the one that i want

2090
02:56:08,740 --> 02:56:10,740
because it was in greece

2091
02:56:10,740 --> 02:56:12,740
and she loves greece

2092
02:56:12,740 --> 02:56:14,740
i really don't like much of the songs

2093
02:56:14,740 --> 02:56:16,740
because i can't sing them

2094
02:56:16,740 --> 02:56:18,740
so it kind of sucks

2095
02:56:18,740 --> 02:56:20,740
i like jennifer lopez's waiting for the night

2096
02:56:20,740 --> 02:56:22,740
because that's the only song i like of hers

2097
02:56:22,740 --> 02:56:24,740
and then

2098
02:56:24,740 --> 02:56:29,300
Broken Wings is alright because I listen to that all the time.

2099
02:56:29,300 --> 02:56:35,740
As far as non-game music, I'd have to say Lady's Night, man.

2100
02:56:35,740 --> 02:56:36,740
That's awesome.

2101
02:56:36,740 --> 02:56:38,740
That's the first time we got Lady's Night.

2102
02:56:38,740 --> 02:56:44,260
I would say it's a close tie between Like a Virgin, because I love singing that song

2103
02:56:44,260 --> 02:56:48,020
because I'm so virginal in here, and Girls Just Want to Have Fun.

2104
02:56:48,020 --> 02:56:49,220
Girls Just Want to Have Lunch.

2105
02:56:49,220 --> 02:56:50,220
Yes.

2106
02:56:50,220 --> 02:56:52,340
Both were weird-out parodies, too, so you can sing the parodies.

2107
02:56:52,340 --> 02:56:56,340
The songs on there, I think, were parodied by Ria, complicated songs.

2108
02:56:56,340 --> 02:57:00,340
Yeah, complicated is on there. And I like complicated, too, because it pisses Nelly off when I sing it.

2109
02:57:00,340 --> 02:57:03,340
Brad, your favorite, because I know you've played the game, too?

2110
02:57:03,340 --> 02:57:08,340
Well, it sure wasn't that friggin' Jennifer Lopez song. God, Matt, you faggot.

2111
02:57:08,340 --> 02:57:13,340
Anyway, um, wait a minute, what am I talking about? My songs are pretty faggoty, too.

2112
02:57:13,340 --> 02:57:21,340
I'd have to say, probably, I don't know, there's three really good ones on there. Bizarre Love Triangle, Huey Lewis in the News with Power of Love,

2113
02:57:21,340 --> 02:57:29,020
of love, and, um, what was that other one I sang? I did the, the Hulu-less one, Bizarre

2114
02:57:29,020 --> 02:57:32,780
Love Triangle was on there, and, what was it? There was another one, but yeah.

2115
02:57:32,780 --> 02:57:34,220
Uh, it's the end of the world, does he know it?

2116
02:57:34,220 --> 02:57:36,620
No, uh, no. REM isn't that great.

2117
02:57:36,620 --> 02:57:37,980
Uh, you just saw me do it!

2118
02:57:37,980 --> 02:57:39,020
Chain of Fools?

2119
02:57:39,020 --> 02:57:42,060
No! Chain, chain, chain!

2120
02:57:42,060 --> 02:57:42,620
I don't remember the other one.

2121
02:57:42,620 --> 02:57:43,820
You're under where?

2122
02:57:43,820 --> 02:57:45,580
I don't remember the other one you did, I'm sorry.

2123
02:57:45,580 --> 02:57:49,500
Uh, frickin' A, I don't know, but yeah, you get it. You get the point. There's, there's

2124
02:57:49,500 --> 02:57:50,620
some good songs on there, so.

2125
02:57:50,620 --> 02:57:53,620
The one from Back to the Future was that you already said that one, right?

2126
02:57:53,620 --> 02:57:55,620
I already said that. Power of Love. Power of Love.

2127
02:57:55,620 --> 02:57:58,620
Alright, a couple more questions, both coming from Azie and Buddy Paul.

2128
02:57:58,620 --> 02:58:00,620
These are the last two of the night, so no more questions for us.

2129
02:58:00,620 --> 02:58:02,620
I'm hijacking. Here we go.

2130
02:58:02,620 --> 02:58:03,620
I'm hijacking.

2131
02:58:03,620 --> 02:58:04,620
Tef, Julian.

2132
02:58:04,620 --> 02:58:05,620
This is a live show.

2133
02:58:05,620 --> 02:58:09,620
We're coming to you live from the hizzle for shizzle.

2134
02:58:09,620 --> 02:58:10,620
Weird dog.

2135
02:58:10,620 --> 02:58:11,620
Such a piehole.

2136
02:58:11,620 --> 02:58:12,620
Alright.

2137
02:58:12,620 --> 02:58:16,620
Azie and Buddy Paul, have any of you had a near-death experience?

2138
02:58:16,620 --> 02:58:17,620
This is a pretty heavy question.

2139
02:58:17,620 --> 02:58:18,620
Yes.

2140
02:58:18,620 --> 02:58:29,140
want to explain it? Hold on. Okay, I'll go first. I went on a groupish date with a friend

2141
02:58:29,140 --> 02:58:35,260
of mine. It was this one guy and his date and my date. And he was driving his mom's,

2142
02:58:35,260 --> 02:58:41,540
thank God, Grand Prix, Pontiac Grand Prix. And it was the first, yeah, well, I say thank

2143
02:58:41,540 --> 02:58:48,580
God because the Grand Prix's actually hold up pretty well in a wreck. We went on a date

2144
02:58:48,580 --> 02:58:51,300
We went to a movie then we came home and right after we got out of theater

2145
02:58:51,300 --> 02:58:54,080
It was the first rain of the season so in the first rain of the season

2146
02:58:54,460 --> 02:59:00,100
Everybody starts driving like complete idiots and since it's the first rain. There's a lot of fresh oil on the road

2147
02:59:00,240 --> 02:59:03,860
So we're driving. He's driving too fast for conditions

2148
02:59:04,740 --> 02:59:06,580
tailgating somebody and

2149
02:59:06,580 --> 02:59:12,580
He's looking behind him talking to the two girls in the rear seat whereas. I'm the only one watching the street

2150
02:59:12,620 --> 02:59:15,020
He's the one driving, but I'm the only one watching the street, so

2151
02:59:15,020 --> 02:59:21,080
So some truck got an accident up ahead, they were parked in the middle of the fast lane,

2152
02:59:21,080 --> 02:59:25,180
and I look and I say, oh shit, look out, stop, and so he turns his head just in time for

2153
02:59:25,180 --> 02:59:30,140
him to swerve to the right a little bit, so only half of the car got hit, this truck with

2154
02:59:30,140 --> 02:59:37,140
an iron bumper, it destroyed the front half, gave me some bruises, but if we had gone straight

2155
02:59:37,140 --> 02:59:41,780
into it instead of to the side, we would have been under the truck and it would have decapitated

2156
02:59:41,780 --> 02:59:43,540
all of us and we would have been dead.

2157
02:59:43,540 --> 02:59:49,940
So thank you to me for saving these three worthless people's lives and myself.

2158
02:59:49,940 --> 02:59:53,500
Mine's not as exciting as that, but it's a little closer to death.

2159
02:59:53,500 --> 02:59:56,500
See, I actually died at 18 months old.

2160
02:59:56,500 --> 02:59:57,500
I'm serious.

2161
02:59:57,500 --> 02:59:59,580
I drowned, and I was pronounced dead.

2162
02:59:59,580 --> 03:00:04,380
And I was out of my brain and stuff for five, ten minutes before my mom put the oxygen mask

2163
03:00:04,380 --> 03:00:05,900
over me and somehow brought me back.

2164
03:00:05,900 --> 03:00:06,900
But I actually died.

2165
03:00:06,900 --> 03:00:07,900
I don't remember anything.

2166
03:00:07,900 --> 03:00:08,900
I was too young.

2167
03:00:08,900 --> 03:00:12,780
But apparently after that, when I came back, my mom taught me to swim pretty quick.

2168
03:00:12,780 --> 03:00:15,140
interesting

2169
03:00:15,140 --> 03:00:16,320
there is one time

2170
03:00:16,320 --> 03:00:18,860
and then i said near death not death

2171
03:00:18,860 --> 03:00:20,420
next time pay attention

2172
03:00:20,420 --> 03:00:24,540
uh...

2173
03:00:24,540 --> 03:00:25,820
and such a dick

2174
03:00:25,820 --> 03:00:27,160
working at one

2175
03:00:27,160 --> 03:00:28,780
uh... yeah sure

2176
03:00:28,780 --> 03:00:32,420
uh... there is this one time where uh...

2177
03:00:32,420 --> 03:00:33,420
i came home

2178
03:00:33,420 --> 03:00:37,140
and like

2179
03:00:37,140 --> 03:00:38,900
no

2180
03:00:38,900 --> 03:00:46,340
No, there was one time I came home and we were out of Captain Crunch and I thought I

2181
03:00:46,340 --> 03:00:53,620
was going to die right there.

2182
03:00:53,620 --> 03:00:58,020
This one time I had to listen to Christmas Speed.

2183
03:00:58,020 --> 03:00:59,580
Other question from Azie and Buddy Paul.

2184
03:00:59,580 --> 03:01:00,700
This is pretty easily answered.

2185
03:01:00,700 --> 03:01:03,340
What is the song we use for the Ask Orange Lounge theme music?

2186
03:01:03,340 --> 03:01:06,260
We get asked this, I swear to God, every other week.

2187
03:01:06,260 --> 03:01:13,260
This is Journey to the Wonderland from Keyboard Mania Second Mix by NPB.

2188
03:01:36,260 --> 03:02:04,260
zer0, your final thought of the evening?

2189
03:02:04,260 --> 03:02:08,860
metal slug just ain't metal slug without the blood

2190
03:02:08,860 --> 03:02:10,740
my final thought of the evening is

2191
03:02:10,740 --> 03:02:15,320
MORTAL COMBAT!

2192
03:02:15,320 --> 03:02:20,280
and uh... Loki your final thought of the evening

2193
03:02:20,280 --> 03:02:23,220
I had too much strawberry soda during this show

2194
03:02:23,220 --> 03:02:26,780
I think I've had a whole six-fashioned... Does your pee smell like strawberries?

2195
03:02:26,780 --> 03:02:32,100
I don't know! Let me get a thrower right now!

2196
03:02:32,100 --> 03:02:38,100
Alright, I'm going to give the final word of the evening, one word, to sum up the whole show and we end on that note tonight.

2197
03:02:38,100 --> 03:02:39,100
No, Dark Child.

2198
03:02:39,100 --> 03:02:42,100
I give the final word of the night tonight to Vandalous.

2199
03:02:42,100 --> 03:02:44,100
You can't have it, Dark Child. You don't get it.

2200
03:02:44,100 --> 03:02:45,100
Goatsy.

2201
03:02:45,100 --> 03:02:46,100
No. No goatsy.

2202
03:02:46,100 --> 03:02:50,100
Vandalous gets the last word of the evening because I know he'll keep it clean.

2203
03:02:50,100 --> 03:02:54,100
Vandalous, the final word of the evening tonight?

2204
03:02:54,100 --> 03:02:56,100
Apple pie.

2205
03:02:56,100 --> 03:02:59,100
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2206
03:02:59,100 --> 03:03:03,600
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sabra, Sky, and Loki.

2207
03:03:03,600 --> 03:03:05,600
We expect you a nice play again.

2208
03:03:05,600 --> 03:03:09,100
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2209
03:03:10,600 --> 03:03:14,600
Trying to save the relationship by talking about having a baby.

2210
03:03:14,600 --> 03:03:16,600
You know, like, that's going to work.

2211
03:03:16,600 --> 03:03:20,600
I had a great, great experience recently.

2212
03:03:20,600 --> 03:03:24,100
I helped deliver one of my best friend's children.

2213
03:03:24,100 --> 03:03:26,600
And, wow, when you witness something like that,

2214
03:03:26,600 --> 03:03:31,880
You see how powerful women are, that we bring forth life.

2215
03:03:31,880 --> 03:03:35,360
I mean, it's awesome.

2216
03:03:35,360 --> 03:03:39,080
And I just was so amazed by my friend,

2217
03:03:39,080 --> 03:03:41,240
because she was not just a woman.

2218
03:03:41,240 --> 03:03:42,480
She was not just a mother.

2219
03:03:42,480 --> 03:03:45,640
At that moment, she was creation.

2220
03:03:45,640 --> 03:03:47,680
She was life.

2221
03:03:47,680 --> 03:03:49,160
She was God.

2222
03:03:49,160 --> 03:03:54,400
And as I looked in her eyes, her pussy exploded.

2223
03:03:54,400 --> 03:04:17,640
a piece of it hit me in the head

2224
03:04:17,640 --> 03:04:33,000
A piece of it hit me in the head!

2225
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:38,840
Everybody else was like holding each other and crying, and I'm like, I'm fucking with

2226
03:04:38,840 --> 03:05:02,280
The nurse was running around collecting pieces of her pussy in a basket, she's just panning

2227
03:05:02,280 --> 03:05:31,240
for pussy. They had to sew it back together.

2228
03:05:31,240 --> 03:05:38,240
frankenpussy. IT'S ALIVE!
