1
00:00:08,914 --> 00:00:13,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

2
00:00:16,656 --> 00:00:21,538
[SPEAKER_20]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the mommy talk and then some.

3
00:00:22,138 --> 00:00:24,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

4
00:00:25,219 --> 00:00:29,241
[SPEAKER_20]: Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

5
00:00:29,861 --> 00:00:34,663
[SPEAKER_20]: Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

6
00:00:35,223 --> 00:00:38,944
[SPEAKER_20]: You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:39,265 --> 00:00:40,745
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I will spank your child.

8
00:00:41,145 --> 00:00:42,866
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

9
00:00:45,543 --> 00:00:49,046
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

10
00:01:09,482 --> 00:01:16,404
[SPEAKER_12]: Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a Pauly Shore movie.

11
00:01:17,384 --> 00:01:18,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah?

12
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,625
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

13
00:01:21,865 --> 00:01:22,905
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura.

14
00:01:23,105 --> 00:01:24,025
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got a sniff.

15
00:01:24,265 --> 00:01:24,765
[SPEAKER_19]: Skye.

16
00:01:24,906 --> 00:01:27,026
[SPEAKER_19]: But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

17
00:01:27,386 --> 00:01:27,886
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki.

18
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:29,186
[SPEAKER_20]: I hate you!

19
00:01:29,607 --> 00:01:31,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio Arts.

20
00:01:32,688 --> 00:01:36,991
[SPEAKER_08]: We are live, and this is episode number 68 for November the 9th of 2003.

21
00:01:37,172 --> 00:01:46,219
[SPEAKER_08]: You're tuned in to the Vimani Scene's most, um, female challenger tonight, radio station of all things Vimani.

22
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,961
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Rob Robertson, you might know me as Sky.

23
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:52,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Joining me, as always, are half of my awesome co-hosts.

24
00:01:52,503 --> 00:01:57,848
[SPEAKER_08]: In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers, is all the way in that corner that's in Alabama.

25
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:00,530
[SPEAKER_08]: She's out tonight, she's on vacation, so...

26
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:03,634
[SPEAKER_08]: So no Jamie tonight, sorry everybody.

27
00:02:04,394 --> 00:02:09,576
[SPEAKER_08]: But we have some more guests here to help kind of fill that void that Jamie has left.

28
00:02:09,636 --> 00:02:10,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this mic on?

29
00:02:10,537 --> 00:02:11,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, the mic is on.

30
00:02:11,897 --> 00:02:12,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Lanky, stop.

31
00:02:13,098 --> 00:02:13,298
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

32
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:14,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Testing.

33
00:02:14,498 --> 00:02:15,179
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go, yeah.

34
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:17,040
[SPEAKER_08]: I told you it was on!

35
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,961
[SPEAKER_08]: You question my authority?

36
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:20,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

37
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:21,822
[SPEAKER_08]: You little poopy head.

38
00:02:22,402 --> 00:02:24,183
[SPEAKER_08]: In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

39
00:02:25,303 --> 00:02:25,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

40
00:02:27,264 --> 00:02:27,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

41
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:30,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's an old one.

42
00:02:30,906 --> 00:02:31,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

43
00:02:32,596 --> 00:02:33,978
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about Walmart again?

44
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:35,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, I'm using an old script.

45
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you hate Walmart still, Rob?

46
00:02:37,602 --> 00:02:38,363
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I hate Walmart?

47
00:02:38,423 --> 00:02:39,183
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll get into that later.

48
00:02:40,445 --> 00:02:41,886
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to have something to talk about tonight, Chris.

49
00:02:42,887 --> 00:02:47,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Also with us tonight we have, as you were already hearing him, because he just can't shut the fuck up.

50
00:02:47,552 --> 00:02:47,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Just kidding.

51
00:02:47,953 --> 00:02:49,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Say it a little Likey style.

52
00:02:49,574 --> 00:02:50,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Up the shut phone.

53
00:02:50,495 --> 00:02:53,238
[SPEAKER_08]: You know him probably if you listen to Vanilla Sky on Monday nights, right?

54
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:53,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

55
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:54,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Because he's always here.

56
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:55,861
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you know me.

57
00:02:55,881 --> 00:03:02,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably just like that annoying guy who always gives us his stupid opinions about how games are cool and some games aren't.

58
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:03,348
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

59
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Castlevania's cool and you all suck.

60
00:03:06,572 --> 00:03:06,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

61
00:03:07,913 --> 00:03:12,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Also here tonight, say hello to Bradley, also known as Arcadian42.

62
00:03:12,457 --> 00:03:12,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

63
00:03:12,938 --> 00:03:13,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, how are you?

64
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Well.

65
00:03:16,101 --> 00:03:16,201
[SPEAKER_08]: Well.

66
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:17,838
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

67
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:23,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, we have somebody who I don't think has ever been to the show in the house before.

68
00:03:23,223 --> 00:03:23,523
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

69
00:03:24,384 --> 00:03:27,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Has joined us for some of our live remotes, but never in the house.

70
00:03:27,887 --> 00:03:29,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Say hello to Vanders.

71
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:30,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Mahalo.

72
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:31,810
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you?

73
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,472
[SPEAKER_04]: I am well, thank you.

74
00:03:33,692 --> 00:03:34,272
[SPEAKER_08]: That's good.

75
00:03:34,332 --> 00:03:35,193
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad you can make it.

76
00:03:35,753 --> 00:03:35,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

77
00:03:36,034 --> 00:03:36,854
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad to be here.

78
00:03:36,914 --> 00:03:37,795
[SPEAKER_08]: This is exciting.

79
00:03:38,296 --> 00:03:40,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Our home base is exactly what I thought it would be.

80
00:03:40,497 --> 00:03:42,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of anime, lots of DVDs, and lots of games.

81
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:44,381
[SPEAKER_08]: And lots of crap everywhere, isn't it?

82
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:46,080
[SPEAKER_04]: and SuperBacon.

83
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,382
[SPEAKER_08]: That's alright, we love, yes and lots of SuperBacon.

84
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:50,604
[SPEAKER_08]: And French bread pizza for me tonight.

85
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:51,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-mm.

86
00:03:52,086 --> 00:03:52,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Yummy.

87
00:03:53,147 --> 00:03:57,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Brad says he needs to be careful because he might trip and fall and eat that pizza!

88
00:03:57,832 --> 00:03:59,874
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll bash his head in if he does.

89
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:05,880
[SPEAKER_08]: That, that French bread pizza needs to be in my belly, dammit.

90
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:16,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, tonight we're going to play some music from the Poppin' 10, Poppin' Music Part 10 soundtrack for our breaks, because I know you guys have been wanting to hear some of the new stuff.

91
00:04:17,393 --> 00:04:22,315
[SPEAKER_08]: During this break we're going to hear a brand new Mr. T song doing the Goonies Are Good Enough.

92
00:04:22,775 --> 00:04:25,196
[SPEAKER_08]: This is awesome.

93
00:04:25,256 --> 00:04:26,016
[SPEAKER_08]: It is awesome.

94
00:04:26,056 --> 00:04:26,977
[SPEAKER_08]: You're outvoted, Loki.

95
00:04:27,557 --> 00:04:32,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Also in this break we're going to hear an artist called Noki Nokio with a song called Pata Pata Mama.

96
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Hatsa Pata Mama is the name of the song we're going to hear second.

97
00:04:37,106 --> 00:04:41,272
[SPEAKER_08]: And then also in this break, we're going to hear a really cool remix of Murmur Twins.

98
00:04:41,793 --> 00:04:45,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Poppin' Music 10 has a guitar remix of Murmur Twins, and we're going to hear that in this break too.

99
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,502
[SPEAKER_08]: So enjoy, we'll be back.

100
00:04:47,682 --> 00:04:49,004
[SPEAKER_08]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

101
00:06:49,548 --> 00:06:58,934
[SPEAKER_14]: 9 o'clock, I'm a do-pa-ta-pa-ta, noisy 7 o'clock, hot pot, car-o-car-o, kitchen 8 o'clock, I'm a do-pa-ta-pa-ta, noisy 9 o'clock, I'm a do-pa-ta-pa-ta, noisy

102
00:07:14,657 --> 00:07:22,486
[SPEAKER_14]: Baby Settaku, Boi Boi Switch on, 11 o'clock, I want to go to the bathroom.

103
00:07:22,686 --> 00:07:25,169
[SPEAKER_14]: 12 o'clock, I want to go to the bathroom.

104
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:26,750
Ah, it's beautiful.

105
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,661
[SPEAKER_14]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

106
00:08:18,852 --> 00:08:19,893
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

107
00:09:21,705 --> 00:09:21,886
and more.

108
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,281
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

109
00:10:11,522 --> 00:10:13,002
[SPEAKER_11]: Extreme Bobani Radio.

110
00:10:13,022 --> 00:10:16,783
[SPEAKER_11]: That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

111
00:10:32,725 --> 00:10:34,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

112
00:10:35,787 --> 00:10:38,848
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was some music from the new Poppin' Music Part 10.

113
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:41,870
[SPEAKER_08]: God, I can't believe that game has gotten that high, all the way to 10.

114
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,092
[SPEAKER_08]: That's more than I think any other Bomani game has gotten yet.

115
00:10:46,192 --> 00:10:48,974
[SPEAKER_08]: What is it about Poppin' Music that makes it so damn popular?

116
00:10:50,034 --> 00:10:50,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Any thoughts?

117
00:10:55,457 --> 00:10:56,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, get a microphone, Loki.

118
00:10:57,118 --> 00:10:58,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on, say it again.

119
00:10:59,585 --> 00:11:03,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Because retards like smashing their heads into large round buttons.

120
00:11:05,074 --> 00:11:06,595
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not quite sure why it's so popular.

121
00:11:06,615 --> 00:11:16,463
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess maybe just the music is more popular over there than, say, 2DX's music seems to be more popular over here, from my little sphere of influence.

122
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,225
[SPEAKER_09]: I personally, I don't know.

123
00:11:18,785 --> 00:11:33,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Since there's so much music in pop music, since there's ten versions now, plus the anime level ones, yeah, there's a lot of good tracks, but overall I think the majority of the music isn't my style, whereas 2DX is more my type of thing, more of a dancey, techno, trancey...

124
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:38,010
[SPEAKER_09]: You and your, you know, rectangular buttons.

125
00:11:38,391 --> 00:11:41,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know, not the big round tap light ones.

126
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead, I've got little, little tiny, like, keys, you know.

127
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, your character, your game doesn't have any characters dancing around.

128
00:11:49,026 --> 00:11:50,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, in some of the videos it does.

129
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:54,067
[SPEAKER_09]: I have all of them.

130
00:12:09,741 --> 00:12:10,441
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, it's crazy.

131
00:12:10,981 --> 00:12:21,184
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just looking at, um, Navi was over at a little gathering we were having last night, and, uh, Navi, um, who's been on the show before, he's kind of known as the local Papa Music whore, and he buys everything relating to Papa Music.

132
00:12:21,204 --> 00:12:22,944
[SPEAKER_08]: He bought this new Papa Music calendar.

133
00:12:23,304 --> 00:12:26,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, this new calendar is like the size of a small poster.

134
00:12:26,405 --> 00:12:28,225
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not the size of your typical calendar, it's bigger.

135
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:33,527
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like the size of a small poster, not a huge wall poster, but like a, like a fold-out poster type thing.

136
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:34,327
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, it's pretty big.

137
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:40,331
[SPEAKER_08]: and the cover of it has every single character from Poppin' Music and it's like looking at a Where's Waldo picture.

138
00:12:40,491 --> 00:12:42,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, there's so many people just packed in there.

139
00:12:42,813 --> 00:12:44,894
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of like, I want to find this one.

140
00:12:44,914 --> 00:12:47,776
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to find the girl that looks like she's flicking her clit in that one song.

141
00:12:48,096 --> 00:12:50,618
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm looking and it's like playing Where's Waldo.

142
00:12:50,638 --> 00:12:52,039
[SPEAKER_08]: There's so damn many characters.

143
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,542
[SPEAKER_08]: And yes, I swear to God, there is a girl that looks like she's flicking her clit in one song.

144
00:12:55,862 --> 00:12:56,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Just wanted to share.

145
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:59,244
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it looks more like she's smoking out of her pussy.

146
00:12:59,304 --> 00:13:00,405
[SPEAKER_09]: She keeps going like this.

147
00:13:00,505 --> 00:13:01,326
[SPEAKER_09]: You know how people smoke?

148
00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:03,667
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm doing the sign with the two fingers out like a peace sign.

149
00:13:03,687 --> 00:13:04,228
[SPEAKER_09]: They're smoking.

150
00:13:05,095 --> 00:13:08,957
[SPEAKER_09]: The best, though, is the character Liddell, who is in, I believe it's Poppin' Music 8.

151
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,879
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's 7 or 8, I can't remember, but it's a song called Galaxy Forest.

152
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:12,519
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's 8 too.

153
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:23,522
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you know what?

154
00:13:23,542 --> 00:13:26,504
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's 7, because I think I've known of Liddell for a while.

155
00:13:26,925 --> 00:13:35,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so I think it's one of the consumer tracks from 7 is Galaxy Forest, and there's this chick Liddell who looks like a sheepherder, but like with no face and just two little lighting eyes.

156
00:13:35,473 --> 00:13:37,815
[SPEAKER_08]: So kind of like a black mage, like if you imagine Vivi, right?

157
00:13:38,156 --> 00:13:40,078
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like Vivi is a sheepherder, but a girl.

158
00:13:40,378 --> 00:13:45,263
[SPEAKER_08]: And like she wears a skirt, but if she loses, like rats fly out of her cooch.

159
00:13:47,065 --> 00:13:49,106
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

160
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, sorry.

161
00:14:20,071 --> 00:14:24,832
[SPEAKER_08]: So I thought maybe we could go through these songs we just played and see what you guys think of them.

162
00:14:25,313 --> 00:14:28,934
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't really ever done that with new songs, but, you know, we're desperate for material tonight.

163
00:14:28,954 --> 00:14:31,995
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's see, what do you guys think of Mr. T with Goonies Are Good Enough?

164
00:14:33,235 --> 00:14:33,875
Crap!

165
00:14:34,035 --> 00:14:38,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Crap, crap, crap, crap.

166
00:14:38,857 --> 00:14:40,037
[SPEAKER_02]: You think this is crap?

167
00:14:40,518 --> 00:14:41,118
[SPEAKER_02]: It is crap.

168
00:14:41,138 --> 00:14:42,018
[SPEAKER_02]: You're crap.

169
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just play some MIDI for you.

170
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:46,160
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't even do anything with it.

171
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:46,940
[SPEAKER_02]: We just play MIDI.

172
00:14:50,717 --> 00:14:52,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that's your opinion.

173
00:14:53,358 --> 00:14:59,701
[SPEAKER_09]: This song brings me back to my days when I was a little kid and used to play Goose 2 on Nintendo.

174
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:01,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's awesome.

175
00:15:01,482 --> 00:15:09,225
[SPEAKER_09]: I've always liked Mr. T, but he's been bringing out some cool stuff ever since, like, I don't know, Burning Heat and stuff like that.

176
00:15:09,305 --> 00:15:10,845
[SPEAKER_09]: So, good stuff.

177
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:16,128
[SPEAKER_09]: It just reminds me of kind of like Akira Yamaoka's feel of his little 8-bit sounding music and stuff.

178
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:17,888
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a question for Loki.

179
00:15:17,908 --> 00:15:19,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you consider this crap funny?

180
00:15:23,513 --> 00:15:23,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

181
00:15:24,974 --> 00:15:25,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait a minute.

182
00:15:25,915 --> 00:15:26,916
[SPEAKER_08]: You like this song.

183
00:15:26,956 --> 00:15:28,057
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen you play it before.

184
00:15:29,358 --> 00:15:30,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, like once.

185
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:31,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Ass.

186
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,780
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't like that song?

187
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:37,097
[SPEAKER_08]: To me, Goonies Are Good Enough is just like, it's kind of like the next chapter.

188
00:15:37,117 --> 00:15:45,143
[SPEAKER_02]: That song right there, that has actual synthesizers and stuff in it, and it actually looks like, you know, they spent more than two minutes on it, okay?

189
00:15:45,624 --> 00:15:49,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas the Goonies song is just like, oh, let's play it straight off Nintendo.

190
00:15:50,147 --> 00:15:52,669
[SPEAKER_02]: And no, it wasn't hard for him to do that.

191
00:15:52,969 --> 00:15:55,671
[SPEAKER_02]: All he did was just throw it into a MIDI player and go.

192
00:15:56,512 --> 00:15:57,472
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, here's my next question.

193
00:15:57,492 --> 00:15:58,173
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think of this?

194
00:16:04,648 --> 00:16:05,289
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's better.

195
00:16:08,032 --> 00:16:10,656
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta keep it with those Faggots!

196
00:16:12,378 --> 00:16:22,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you're gonna play a faggoty song anyways, at least play it so it sounds like a faggoty song instead of faggoty 8-bit shit.

197
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:30,151
[SPEAKER_09]: The opinions and whatever of Loki do not... Yeah, you get it.

198
00:16:30,631 --> 00:16:31,172
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't care.

199
00:16:31,212 --> 00:16:32,172
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gay and I think it's funny.

200
00:16:32,453 --> 00:16:38,057
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um... We all know Loki's type.

201
00:16:38,257 --> 00:16:39,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Type with the queers.

202
00:16:39,418 --> 00:16:40,999
[SPEAKER_08]: He loves his queers.

203
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:42,540
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I love my goonies, okay?

204
00:16:42,741 --> 00:16:44,022
[SPEAKER_02]: He's friendly.

205
00:16:45,781 --> 00:16:56,548
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Goonies, that movie rocks And to totally take that song and just take a huge dump on it It's just awful But doesn't that song, isn't it even remotely retro to you?

206
00:16:56,609 --> 00:16:59,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Didn't you ever play the Goonies 2 on Nintendo?

207
00:17:00,211 --> 00:17:01,732
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that doesn't exist.

208
00:17:01,952 --> 00:17:04,013
[SPEAKER_08]: She turned into a fucking mermaid.

209
00:17:04,053 --> 00:17:07,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on, that does not exist.

210
00:17:07,696 --> 00:17:12,959
[SPEAKER_08]: I've read online that people think that that song is the Goonies 2 song just lifted from the game.

211
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:16,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I hate to break it to you, but 8-Bit sounded a lot worse than that.

212
00:17:16,561 --> 00:17:17,902
[SPEAKER_08]: So that has been redone.

213
00:17:18,302 --> 00:17:20,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, to me, not enough in my opinion.

214
00:17:20,804 --> 00:17:21,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

215
00:17:21,464 --> 00:17:26,067
[SPEAKER_08]: That song is to Goonies 2 like Burning Heat was to Gradius 2.

216
00:17:27,136 --> 00:17:29,338
[SPEAKER_08]: To me, that's just kind of the next chapter of the Burning Heat.

217
00:17:29,438 --> 00:17:32,481
[SPEAKER_08]: It's taking another old-school Konami theme and redoing it.

218
00:17:32,781 --> 00:17:38,125
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's all hope to God the next Mr. T tackles Castlevania 2, because I would poop my pants.

219
00:17:39,046 --> 00:17:39,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my God.

220
00:17:41,108 --> 00:17:42,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the thing I've always been pissed off about.

221
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:46,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Akumajou Dracula Medley from, what is it, Keyboard Mania 2nd?

222
00:17:46,572 --> 00:17:46,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

223
00:17:48,388 --> 00:17:53,211
[SPEAKER_09]: is like already perfectly suited for Guitar Freaks and Drone Mania session, and it never showed up.

224
00:17:53,231 --> 00:17:58,875
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got the, you know, come on man, more Castlevania music in Romani games, please.

225
00:18:00,296 --> 00:18:02,357
[SPEAKER_09]: No more Gradius, or Goonies.

226
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:06,310
[SPEAKER_08]: The music in Gradius was cool.

227
00:18:24,741 --> 00:18:30,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Roller Games, stupid rollerblading or, you know, roller derby type game that they made.

228
00:18:30,745 --> 00:18:33,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Or, yeah, Rush Attack or Metal Gear the Original.

229
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:36,969
[SPEAKER_09]: They always had pretty good music for, like, the hardware that they were putting it on.

230
00:18:38,069 --> 00:18:39,550
[SPEAKER_09]: And, yeah, Gradius' music was cool.

231
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Even the 2DX songs are very good and stuff.

232
00:18:41,632 --> 00:18:43,333
[SPEAKER_09]: But I want Castlevania music.

233
00:18:45,174 --> 00:18:47,175
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you haven't played it yet, go play the new Castlevania.

234
00:18:47,215 --> 00:18:47,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Good stuff.

235
00:18:47,796 --> 00:18:48,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Get the soundtrack.

236
00:18:48,396 --> 00:18:48,936
[SPEAKER_09]: It's awesome.

237
00:18:49,777 --> 00:18:51,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Do they actually have a CD soundtrack for that?

238
00:18:52,126 --> 00:19:21,052
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, Japan will, we won't um, the game came out here in America first and they're gonna release it over there like a month later with a CD soundtrack and like tons of freaking collectibles and stuff cause we don't get that cool stuff over here damn you, Konami of America yeah, here we stupid Americans we not good enough for collector edition oh well any other thoughts on Goonies are Good Enough?

239
00:19:22,543 --> 00:19:22,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

240
00:19:23,725 --> 00:19:24,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, it was crap.

241
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I think those Goonies were good enough.

242
00:19:29,632 --> 00:19:30,453
[SPEAKER_09]: That's better than the movie.

243
00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:33,076
[SPEAKER_09]: That song should have been in the movie.

244
00:19:33,537 --> 00:19:35,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I don't know, like, just like that.

245
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Weird synthesizer sounding and stuff.

246
00:19:39,192 --> 00:19:39,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Here, talk.

247
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:41,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's go to the next song.

248
00:19:41,975 --> 00:19:45,037
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to play this just because of the name alone.

249
00:19:45,057 --> 00:19:47,379
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a song called Pata Pata Mama.

250
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:48,741
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the next song we played on that break.

251
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:54,726
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think of this one?

252
00:19:56,968 --> 00:19:57,749
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think of this one?

253
00:19:57,789 --> 00:20:00,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we know why those schoolgirls jumped in front of the train.

254
00:20:03,974 --> 00:20:04,955
[SPEAKER_08]: That bad, huh?

255
00:20:06,147 --> 00:20:11,571
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's cute, in a poppin' music way, and only a way that poppin' music can be.

256
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:12,152
[SPEAKER_08]: That song is cute.

257
00:20:12,172 --> 00:20:20,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Poppin' music belongs in the Twilight Zone, because seriously, it has like the worst music ever, and then, yet, they keep releasing more sequels for it.

258
00:20:22,941 --> 00:20:25,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, whatever you say.

259
00:20:25,363 --> 00:20:30,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and then next was a remix of Murmur Twins, the guitar version of Murmur Twins.

260
00:20:31,387 --> 00:20:31,728
I don't know

261
00:20:37,827 --> 00:20:38,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.

262
00:20:38,268 --> 00:20:39,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, that's acceptable.

263
00:20:40,151 --> 00:20:40,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wow.

264
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:45,100
[SPEAKER_09]: I was expecting something, you know, angsty from him.

265
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Murmur Twins.

266
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Good, good.

267
00:20:47,244 --> 00:20:50,990
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't like, you know, Shitty Middy and whatever the fuck that other one was.

268
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I don't even know what the other one was.

269
00:20:53,951 --> 00:20:54,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Screw that.

270
00:20:54,491 --> 00:20:55,392
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, this is good.

271
00:20:55,972 --> 00:20:57,153
[SPEAKER_09]: DJW is awesome.

272
00:20:57,574 --> 00:21:02,037
[SPEAKER_09]: Murmur Twins, Spica, Linus, all the cool stuff he's done.

273
00:21:02,057 --> 00:21:08,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Murmur Twins has probably always been my favorite of his, so this is pretty cool that they actually remixed it and such.

274
00:21:09,442 --> 00:21:11,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Just don't do like a trance remix of it ever, please.

275
00:21:13,846 --> 00:21:18,669
[SPEAKER_08]: I imagine that'll probably be in the next 2DX, because remember how Night Style was just like remix hell?

276
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:22,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Like everything was just remixed and the shit out of it in Night Style?

277
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:24,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I don't know.

278
00:21:24,986 --> 00:21:35,013
[SPEAKER_09]: I think DJW's little forte is using kind of like keyboards and piano a lot, almost like an Osamu Kubota-ish, but not as classical sounding.

279
00:21:35,073 --> 00:21:37,954
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I don't think they would do like a trancy version, really.

280
00:21:38,775 --> 00:21:39,115
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

281
00:21:39,615 --> 00:21:43,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Then again, Moonchild is kind of different from his other stuff, so whatever.

282
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:46,079
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

283
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,601
[SPEAKER_08]: So any other thoughts on Murmur Twins?

284
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:49,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone?

285
00:21:49,982 --> 00:21:50,182
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

286
00:21:51,189 --> 00:21:55,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello to Slinky, by the way, who showed up while we were talking about all the poppin' music stuff.

287
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,031
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you, sir?

288
00:21:59,592 --> 00:21:59,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

289
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:00,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

290
00:22:02,213 --> 00:22:02,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.

291
00:22:02,993 --> 00:22:03,553
[SPEAKER_08]: That's good.

292
00:22:03,633 --> 00:22:05,154
[SPEAKER_08]: So you drove yourself here tonight, huh?

293
00:22:05,854 --> 00:22:06,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

294
00:22:06,674 --> 00:22:07,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations.

295
00:22:08,175 --> 00:22:08,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

296
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Did Mommy and Daddy buy you a car?

297
00:22:12,096 --> 00:22:12,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

298
00:22:12,556 --> 00:22:13,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Spoiled brat!

299
00:22:13,976 --> 00:22:14,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

300
00:22:16,721 --> 00:22:17,001
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

301
00:22:17,582 --> 00:22:20,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, my mom and dad were going to give me an old car of theirs, too, when I got my license.

302
00:22:21,304 --> 00:22:23,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Only, we had a big flood, and it drowned.

303
00:22:23,646 --> 00:22:25,087
[SPEAKER_08]: It drowned?

304
00:22:25,107 --> 00:22:25,507
[SPEAKER_08]: It drowned.

305
00:22:25,527 --> 00:22:26,208
[SPEAKER_08]: The car drowned.

306
00:22:27,028 --> 00:22:27,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

307
00:22:28,209 --> 00:22:30,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so, I'm just bitter.

308
00:22:30,171 --> 00:22:30,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't listen to me.

309
00:22:31,031 --> 00:22:33,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe you shouldn't have living cars anymore, then.

310
00:22:34,714 --> 00:22:36,155
[SPEAKER_08]: No, my car, it died.

311
00:22:36,335 --> 00:22:39,917
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you turn the key in, it won't start anymore, because, you know, there's mud everywhere.

312
00:22:39,938 --> 00:22:41,258
[SPEAKER_08]: It's dead.

313
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:41,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Dead.

314
00:22:45,541 --> 00:22:48,645
[SPEAKER_09]: You shouldn't drive the car into the river again then, maybe.

315
00:22:48,685 --> 00:22:50,787
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I did not drive the car into the river.

316
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:51,848
[SPEAKER_08]: My dad parked it

317
00:22:55,084 --> 00:22:59,727
[SPEAKER_08]: He parked it near a creek, which is typical because there's a parking lot next to this creek.

318
00:22:59,747 --> 00:23:00,808
[SPEAKER_08]: And what do you do in parking lots?

319
00:23:00,828 --> 00:23:01,549
[SPEAKER_08]: You park your car.

320
00:23:01,569 --> 00:23:02,429
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what he did.

321
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,591
[SPEAKER_08]: No, he did not park his car in the creek.

322
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:10,616
[SPEAKER_08]: He parked his car next to the creek, and then it rained like, what, 8 inches in 24 hours or something fucking crazy?

323
00:23:11,216 --> 00:23:17,941
[SPEAKER_08]: No, this was in 1995 when California had those huge floods and President Clinton came out here and everything, and the car just floated away.

324
00:23:18,662 --> 00:23:21,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Too bad the floods didn't sweep him away when he was out here.

325
00:23:23,928 --> 00:23:24,428
[SPEAKER_08]: I cried.

326
00:23:24,468 --> 00:23:25,529
[SPEAKER_08]: But my car now is cool.

327
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:28,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, the car I was supposed to have was a Ford Explorer.

328
00:23:29,011 --> 00:23:30,471
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a 92 Ford Explorer.

329
00:23:30,892 --> 00:23:35,674
[SPEAKER_08]: And my friends and I always called it the Jurassic Park car because it was the same car they used in Jurassic Park.

330
00:23:35,754 --> 00:23:40,577
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, we always used to get in the car and go... I know.

331
00:23:40,737 --> 00:23:41,337
[SPEAKER_08]: We were dorks.

332
00:23:41,457 --> 00:23:42,118
[SPEAKER_08]: What can I say?

333
00:23:43,138 --> 00:23:44,439
[SPEAKER_08]: No, actually, it never got old.

334
00:23:44,459 --> 00:23:45,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Kill yourself now.

335
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:46,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Awful.

336
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:57,619
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope a dinosaur eats you while you're on the crapper.

337
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Jurassic Park 4 was awesome.

338
00:24:02,921 --> 00:24:04,241
[SPEAKER_10]: There was no Jurassic Park 4.

339
00:24:05,321 --> 00:24:06,341
[SPEAKER_09]: There was no Jurassic Park 4.

340
00:24:06,662 --> 00:24:07,662
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what's so great about it.

341
00:24:15,384 --> 00:24:16,144
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, I know.

342
00:24:17,084 --> 00:24:18,364
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do, I miss my car.

343
00:24:18,384 --> 00:24:20,545
[SPEAKER_08]: You know whenever I think about my car I get all nostalgic?

344
00:24:26,209 --> 00:24:27,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do you have this?

345
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you a Closet Jurassic Park fan?

346
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you like dinosaurs?

347
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:33,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Pink dinosaurs?

348
00:24:37,111 --> 00:24:39,432
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I just happen to like John Williams.

349
00:24:39,452 --> 00:24:41,732
[SPEAKER_08]: I happen to like John Williams, is that so wrong?

350
00:24:41,852 --> 00:24:45,513
[SPEAKER_08]: I reorganized my MP3 collection not too long ago.

351
00:24:46,253 --> 00:24:48,234
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, John Williams is one of the greatest composers ever.

352
00:24:51,064 --> 00:24:53,384
[SPEAKER_08]: They are really making a Jurassic Park 4, though, you do know.

353
00:24:53,665 --> 00:24:56,185
[SPEAKER_08]: You do know this, because Jurassic Park 3 did really, really well.

354
00:24:56,265 --> 00:24:57,865
[SPEAKER_08]: So, of course, there'll be a Jurassic Park 4.

355
00:24:58,385 --> 00:24:59,106
[SPEAKER_08]: It did well?

356
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:00,946
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know anybody who saw it.

357
00:25:01,906 --> 00:25:02,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Really.

358
00:25:02,206 --> 00:25:08,847
[SPEAKER_09]: I would only see it because William H. Macy's in it, that's all.

359
00:25:09,768 --> 00:25:10,588
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell?

360
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:15,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Look, Thanos is showing... What is that?

361
00:25:15,589 --> 00:25:16,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they raccoons?

362
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on, get this on the mic.

363
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this Satan worshipping?

364
00:25:30,645 --> 00:25:31,825
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't... This is weird.

365
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:33,347
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like Silent Hill music.

366
00:25:35,748 --> 00:25:36,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.

367
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,050
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm dying.

368
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:41,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Too much nostalgia is bad for me.

369
00:25:41,192 --> 00:25:42,233
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

370
00:25:43,314 --> 00:25:43,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

371
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:49,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you post the link to that badger thing in the chat room so if they... Oh, did they get... Oh, okay.

372
00:25:49,443 --> 00:25:50,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, somebody else put it in there.

373
00:25:50,504 --> 00:25:50,764
[SPEAKER_08]: I see.

374
00:25:50,965 --> 00:25:51,225
[SPEAKER_08]: I see.

375
00:25:51,605 --> 00:25:51,885
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

376
00:25:52,346 --> 00:25:53,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I see what happened.

377
00:25:53,747 --> 00:25:54,668
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all Wampa's fault.

378
00:25:55,048 --> 00:25:55,369
[SPEAKER_08]: I get it.

379
00:25:55,989 --> 00:25:56,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

380
00:25:58,752 --> 00:26:01,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Do the badgers ever do anything other than just stand there and dance?

381
00:26:02,575 --> 00:26:02,955
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they just badger.

382
00:26:02,975 --> 00:26:03,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, they just badger.

383
00:26:03,656 --> 00:26:04,076
[SPEAKER_08]: That's cute.

384
00:26:04,657 --> 00:26:05,077
[SPEAKER_08]: That's cute.

385
00:26:09,013 --> 00:26:20,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Random Snake, that's good Okay, now this is a part of the show where we usually like to kick off the show with this But, you know, we're a little late tonight, oh well I thought we'd play a little bit of How was your week, how was your day?

386
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,542
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the part of the show where we go around and ask everybody How was your week, how was your day?

387
00:26:26,482 --> 00:26:29,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki How was your week, how was your day?

388
00:26:37,127 --> 00:26:38,148
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that mic is off, Loki

389
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:45,592
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you're disconnected then, because I'm not hearing it.

390
00:26:49,657 --> 00:26:50,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn it!

391
00:26:50,137 --> 00:26:50,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn you!

392
00:26:50,418 --> 00:26:50,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn you!

393
00:26:50,898 --> 00:26:52,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, how was your week, how was your day, Loki?

394
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:54,342
[SPEAKER_08]: I have bacon grease in my hands.

395
00:26:55,243 --> 00:26:55,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, um...

396
00:26:58,376 --> 00:26:58,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

397
00:26:58,836 --> 00:27:02,357
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing worth mentioning this week is I went and saw Matrix Revolutions.

398
00:27:02,437 --> 00:27:03,098
[SPEAKER_02]: It was okay.

399
00:27:03,878 --> 00:27:04,278
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good.

400
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,839
[SPEAKER_07]: And I went and saw Elf yesterday.

401
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:08,859
[SPEAKER_07]: That was good.

402
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:14,521
[SPEAKER_08]: And... It looks like a movie that's going to be really manipulative, though.

403
00:27:14,681 --> 00:27:19,363
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to have one of those crybaby endings and like family... Feel good, family fun.

404
00:27:19,463 --> 00:27:19,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

405
00:27:20,303 --> 00:27:30,394
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it is with people making Christmas movies and thinking that at the end of every Christmas movie has to be, for some reason, you have to get the Christmas spirit and then everything is message.

406
00:27:30,854 --> 00:27:40,625
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, the whole movie was good until they threw out like the, Oh, everyone must believe in Santa or else Christmas will not be saved!

407
00:27:41,025 --> 00:27:44,387
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just so awful that they do stuff like that.

408
00:27:44,587 --> 00:27:45,727
[SPEAKER_02]: But the rest of the movie is awesome.

409
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, why don't they make movies about real life?

410
00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:55,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Some people don't get to have Christmas because they're so poor and they don't get to eat but once a week and stuff.

411
00:27:55,572 --> 00:27:58,394
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a nice, uplifting Christmas story.

412
00:27:58,554 --> 00:28:00,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, what about the Jews?

413
00:28:01,161 --> 00:28:01,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

414
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,822
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go see the movie.

415
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:07,043
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a part in the movie though where he's talking to Santa.

416
00:28:07,063 --> 00:28:18,246
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, there's been rumors going around that parents are telling their children or that people are believing that their parents are putting the presents under the tree and they're all

417
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,381
[SPEAKER_02]: How is that possible?

418
00:28:20,461 --> 00:28:22,562
[SPEAKER_02]: How would they even be able to do that in one night?

419
00:28:23,022 --> 00:28:23,803
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, I know.

420
00:28:24,724 --> 00:28:25,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Then what about the cookies?

421
00:28:26,145 --> 00:28:27,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they think that they eat the cookies too?

422
00:28:28,286 --> 00:28:28,986
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess so.

423
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:31,408
[SPEAKER_02]: They just said it so sarcastically it was funny.

424
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:36,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there's no Santa Claus!

425
00:28:36,752 --> 00:28:38,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Loki, ruining Christmas everywhere.

426
00:28:39,393 --> 00:28:44,177
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to go and let my kids believe that there's this fake Santa Claus or Easter Bunny.

427
00:28:44,217 --> 00:28:46,979
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to make it a little more realistic for them.

428
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:52,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Mom and Dad have to take out another loan on the house because you want your fucking presents, you little brats.

429
00:28:53,374 --> 00:28:53,775
You know what?

430
00:28:54,355 --> 00:28:55,656
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a fun little side topic.

431
00:28:55,696 --> 00:28:57,277
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to pose this question to everybody in here.

432
00:28:57,958 --> 00:29:01,901
[SPEAKER_08]: How old were you when you found out there was no Santa Claus, and how did you react?

433
00:29:03,082 --> 00:29:06,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, how old were you when you found out there was no Santa Claus, and how did you react?

434
00:29:06,905 --> 00:29:08,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, damn, I don't even remember.

435
00:29:08,306 --> 00:29:09,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't think I cared.

436
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:11,328
[SPEAKER_02]: I was getting presents anyways.

437
00:29:11,889 --> 00:29:14,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

438
00:29:15,452 --> 00:29:15,952
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Brad.

439
00:29:17,406 --> 00:29:21,408
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was like four or five, you know, as far as I can remember.

440
00:29:21,849 --> 00:29:23,089
[SPEAKER_09]: And I reacted pretty well.

441
00:29:23,109 --> 00:29:27,191
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, oh, cool, a new 4-0 hidden in my mom's closet.

442
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:30,193
[SPEAKER_09]: So I took it pretty well.

443
00:29:32,274 --> 00:29:32,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Vambos?

444
00:29:34,215 --> 00:29:35,776
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you guys talking about, there's no Santa Claus?

445
00:29:38,408 --> 00:29:41,729
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was like a big joke, isn't it?

446
00:29:42,229 --> 00:29:44,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what we do on the radio.

447
00:29:44,369 --> 00:29:44,869
[SPEAKER_02]: We kid.

448
00:29:44,969 --> 00:29:45,489
[SPEAKER_02]: I kid.

449
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I kid.

450
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:51,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, I actually found out because my parents told me they got tired of trying to play it off like there was.

451
00:29:51,371 --> 00:29:52,511
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they said, hey, you know what?

452
00:29:52,531 --> 00:29:54,431
[SPEAKER_04]: We just put the presents under the tree for you.

453
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,532
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm kind of jaded about that kind of stuff.

454
00:29:58,312 --> 00:30:02,613
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why my kids don't think there's a Santa Claus either because that's all kind of... He's a silly little red elf.

455
00:30:02,973 --> 00:30:19,437
[SPEAKER_08]: I was about to say, since you actually have kids who are of the age where they're not babies, they're toddlers now and they're thinking about Santa Claus and all that, did you try the Santa Claus thing with them or did you just say, screw it, you know what kids, I'm going to tell you a secret.

456
00:30:19,477 --> 00:30:22,098
[SPEAKER_08]: The other kids are going to try to feed you this Santa crap.

457
00:30:23,318 --> 00:30:24,318
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty essentially it.

458
00:30:24,338 --> 00:30:26,299
[SPEAKER_04]: We told them, you know, he's a funny little elf.

459
00:30:26,843 --> 00:30:30,366
[SPEAKER_04]: All he does is beg for money to give to the Red Cross, that greedy bastard.

460
00:30:30,386 --> 00:30:30,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Will.

461
00:30:47,441 --> 00:30:49,922
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you're the youngest one here, but the news has been broken, yes?

462
00:30:50,322 --> 00:30:50,842
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just kidding.

463
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:51,242
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kidding.

464
00:30:51,262 --> 00:30:51,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.

465
00:30:52,343 --> 00:30:53,523
[SPEAKER_06]: How old were you and how did you react?

466
00:30:54,584 --> 00:30:55,184
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

467
00:30:55,204 --> 00:30:57,545
[SPEAKER_06]: I was probably like nine or ten.

468
00:30:58,245 --> 00:30:59,245
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't really remember.

469
00:31:02,326 --> 00:31:03,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, presents.

470
00:31:04,267 --> 00:31:05,507
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't care because you were still getting presents?

471
00:31:06,168 --> 00:31:07,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

472
00:31:07,328 --> 00:31:08,488
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't a huge shock.

473
00:31:08,508 --> 00:31:13,190
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, by that age, it's not very believable anymore anyways.

474
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:15,551
[SPEAKER_15]: I see.

475
00:31:16,206 --> 00:31:18,707
[SPEAKER_02]: The logistics of it just is what clued me in on it.

476
00:31:18,747 --> 00:31:23,328
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, how can a fat fuck fit down the goddamn, you know, chimney anyways?

477
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:25,549
[SPEAKER_02]: So he uses his magic powers.

478
00:31:25,869 --> 00:31:26,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, magic powers.

479
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that convenient?

480
00:31:29,951 --> 00:31:31,671
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Bradley, want to share?

481
00:31:33,252 --> 00:31:33,952
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really remember.

482
00:31:34,432 --> 00:31:37,813
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like round five or six, maybe, and my sister told me.

483
00:31:38,374 --> 00:31:38,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

484
00:31:41,215 --> 00:31:42,255
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think I was really shocked.

485
00:31:43,613 --> 00:31:47,196
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that sounds very like you, Bradley, where you just would have been, okay.

486
00:31:49,037 --> 00:31:50,018
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of surprised by that.

487
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:51,318
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't, like, become emotional?

488
00:31:55,041 --> 00:32:05,989
[SPEAKER_08]: I was five years old when I found out because my mom just started putting the presents under the tree that said, From Santa, under the tree on the 23rd, because she was just getting lazy and she didn't want to play the game anymore.

489
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:09,111
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was kind of like, why does Santa and you have the same handwriting?

490
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,200
[SPEAKER_08]: and she'd just ignore me.

491
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,602
[SPEAKER_08]: How come the presents are under the tree on the 23rd?

492
00:32:13,963 --> 00:32:16,846
[SPEAKER_08]: How come the cookies are still gone and we have to leave them out on the 24th?

493
00:32:17,026 --> 00:32:19,568
[SPEAKER_08]: How come the reindeer hooves look just like the rabbit hooves?

494
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:24,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I was totally that kind of kid where like whenever anybody would try to tell me something I'd be all, why?

495
00:32:25,054 --> 00:32:25,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

496
00:32:25,835 --> 00:32:26,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

497
00:32:26,275 --> 00:32:27,877
[SPEAKER_08]: I was that annoying little shit.

498
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to know what I did?

499
00:32:31,691 --> 00:32:31,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

500
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:34,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I was real into, like, spying and all that cool shit, you know?

501
00:32:35,473 --> 00:32:37,054
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I had... I am not surprised.

502
00:32:37,134 --> 00:32:37,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not surprised.

503
00:32:37,514 --> 00:32:53,523
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I had is I had, um, ultraviolet pens, and I marked all the packages that were hidden in the closet to prove or not if they were from Santa or whatever, because they would... They didn't want to mark who they were for or who they were from, so they can get the from Santa ones, and you take my little ultraviolet light, and you go, Ha!

504
00:32:53,543 --> 00:32:53,583
Ha!

505
00:32:53,983 --> 00:32:54,844
[SPEAKER_02]: You tried to trick me?

506
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:56,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw right through it.

507
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki Everett, Conspiracy Theorist.

508
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:02,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God.

509
00:33:03,788 --> 00:33:08,172
[SPEAKER_04]: My parents used to leave the tags on the presents because they wanted to be able to return them.

510
00:33:09,413 --> 00:33:15,900
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when I saw that Santa Claus shopped at the commissary on base, wow, he really saved some money doing that.

511
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,600
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought he made them.

512
00:33:17,561 --> 00:33:19,583
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a nice revelation there.

513
00:33:19,844 --> 00:33:20,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Santa's military.

514
00:33:20,684 --> 00:33:21,205
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know that.

515
00:33:23,393 --> 00:33:25,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, what a nice sweater from Santa.

516
00:33:25,734 --> 00:33:28,575
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know Santa's workshop was called Mervins.

517
00:33:30,936 --> 00:33:33,877
[SPEAKER_02]: And why isn't Santa, you know, contributing to the U.S.

518
00:33:33,937 --> 00:33:34,477
[SPEAKER_02]: economy?

519
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:38,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if he's, like, using all this elf labor and stuff, do they have unions?

520
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:45,121
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, because he's making a lot of, you know, knockoff goods and stuff and selling them, calling them, you know, name brand.

521
00:33:45,181 --> 00:33:45,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know.

522
00:33:45,801 --> 00:33:46,461
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not very nice.

523
00:33:47,722 --> 00:33:49,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Walmart kind of reminds me of the North Pole.

524
00:33:52,051 --> 00:33:52,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

525
00:33:52,371 --> 00:33:53,712
[SPEAKER_08]: The North Pole has hicks?

526
00:33:57,573 --> 00:34:00,974
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't find a fucking place to park at the North Pole on a Saturday.

527
00:34:00,994 --> 00:34:04,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I'm sorry.

528
00:34:04,356 --> 00:34:04,836
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, Loki.

529
00:34:04,856 --> 00:34:07,097
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to finish talking to us about how your week and how your day was?

530
00:34:07,217 --> 00:34:10,058
[SPEAKER_08]: You saw Matrix, you saw... I saw the Matrix and I saw Elf.

531
00:34:10,178 --> 00:34:10,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Elf was cool.

532
00:34:11,518 --> 00:34:13,419
[SPEAKER_08]: I watched half of the Matrix the other day.

533
00:34:13,439 --> 00:34:15,060
[SPEAKER_08]: I was kind of looking over your shoulder.

534
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks to piracy.

535
00:34:17,793 --> 00:34:28,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks to Piracy, because you know, all those methods that they put watermarking the goddamn film and checking people's bags and stuff, you can see it's totally put a stop to piracy.

536
00:34:28,305 --> 00:34:35,633
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, it's one of those things where I wanted to try it before I buy it, and I tried it, and I've decided, you know what, I think I'll just watch the other half at home.

537
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:38,935
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, here's what it is.

538
00:34:39,015 --> 00:34:44,377
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, I'm sorry, I don't want to go to the theater and pay $18 every time I go see a movie.

539
00:34:44,977 --> 00:34:46,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to watch it once in the theater.

540
00:34:46,277 --> 00:34:47,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

541
00:34:48,017 --> 00:34:49,138
[SPEAKER_08]: You pay for your date?

542
00:34:50,758 --> 00:34:50,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

543
00:34:51,978 --> 00:34:52,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

544
00:34:56,459 --> 00:34:57,499
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are going to hell.

545
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,020
[SPEAKER_09]: You're stealing from...

546
00:35:00,976 --> 00:35:04,800
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw Kill Bill three times in the theater to make up for it, so...

547
00:35:13,851 --> 00:35:14,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck the DeWitchowski Brothers!

548
00:35:15,231 --> 00:35:17,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Warner Brothers Entertainment for a while.

549
00:35:17,352 --> 00:35:18,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck the Warner Brothers!

550
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:21,353
[SPEAKER_09]: They've made almost one billion dollars on the franchise.

551
00:35:21,393 --> 00:35:22,273
[SPEAKER_09]: They can go to hell.

552
00:35:23,013 --> 00:35:23,634
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really care.

553
00:35:24,054 --> 00:35:29,115
[SPEAKER_09]: And they spent about one billion dollars making all the second and third movies.

554
00:35:30,155 --> 00:35:31,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Think of all the starving children that could have fed.

555
00:35:32,936 --> 00:35:34,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, like Keanu Reeves.

556
00:35:37,017 --> 00:35:38,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, think of all the acting classes he could have gone to.

557
00:35:39,978 --> 00:35:40,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's funny.

558
00:35:40,918 --> 00:35:41,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Here.

559
00:35:42,145 --> 00:35:46,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if anything, I want to see the Wachowski brothers take on Bill and Ted 3, okay?

560
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:48,072
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they need to make.

561
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:52,337
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all that he's good at, just bring it back, bring it back to old school.

562
00:35:53,939 --> 00:35:57,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, seriously, just have it like Bill and Ted do something, you know, 3.

563
00:35:59,806 --> 00:36:00,787
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, um...

564
00:36:02,754 --> 00:36:03,535
[SPEAKER_08]: So what else did I do?

565
00:36:03,755 --> 00:36:05,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I made two more remixes, the only other was tonight.

566
00:36:06,337 --> 00:36:12,602
[SPEAKER_08]: And I did a live show last night, you know, an impromptu Livewire show at like 1 in the morning.

567
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:16,065
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was cool, because I was bored.

568
00:36:16,906 --> 00:36:22,510
[SPEAKER_08]: And I tricked the chat room into thinking I was a person called Death by Syrup from Canada.

569
00:36:23,371 --> 00:36:25,634
[SPEAKER_08]: And they should have known right there that that was your super bacon.

570
00:36:25,875 --> 00:36:26,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Right there.

571
00:36:26,295 --> 00:36:27,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that was the bacon you made tonight.

572
00:36:28,198 --> 00:36:28,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?

573
00:36:28,378 --> 00:36:28,578
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

574
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:33,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I got the syrup idea from seeing Elf because he, like, would drink syrup.

575
00:36:34,146 --> 00:36:34,347
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

576
00:36:35,871 --> 00:36:36,692
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's good.

577
00:36:36,812 --> 00:36:37,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Serb shots, man.

578
00:36:37,772 --> 00:36:38,733
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to do some of those.

579
00:36:39,133 --> 00:36:39,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my God.

580
00:36:39,874 --> 00:36:41,174
[SPEAKER_08]: We did the Serb shots.

581
00:36:41,414 --> 00:36:42,075
[SPEAKER_21]: We went to LA.

582
00:36:42,215 --> 00:36:44,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we went to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.

583
00:36:44,376 --> 00:36:46,638
[SPEAKER_08]: It was right after CyberZone, the big tournament there.

584
00:36:46,678 --> 00:36:53,042
[SPEAKER_08]: A bunch of us went over to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffle, and it was like, what, me, Brad, Irene, Mel B. It was everybody.

585
00:36:53,062 --> 00:36:53,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Who else was at our table?

586
00:36:53,982 --> 00:36:54,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Tons of Bay Area people.

587
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:57,204
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was mostly our table that did the Serb shots.

588
00:36:57,284 --> 00:37:00,346
[SPEAKER_09]: You, me, Irene, Fury, I think was there.

589
00:37:00,406 --> 00:37:00,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Fury, yeah.

590
00:37:01,167 --> 00:37:02,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Wendell, Mel B. Wendell and Mel B.

591
00:37:03,508 --> 00:37:10,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Damn, and it was just this, they give you these little, like, shot glasses full of syrup, and it's like warm syrup to put on your waffles and chicken.

592
00:37:11,511 --> 00:37:13,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice, warm, gooey, gooey butter.

593
00:37:13,172 --> 00:37:21,516
[SPEAKER_09]: But the thing is, since it's warm, if you've ever cooked, like, soup or something that's, like, thick, when you're heating it up, it starts to create a film on top that gets kind of hard.

594
00:37:22,096 --> 00:37:23,396
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what happened to this syrup.

595
00:37:23,436 --> 00:37:26,738
[SPEAKER_09]: So you had the nice little, it's almost like a tequila shot with the worm in it.

596
00:37:27,498 --> 00:37:29,579
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a hard thing of syrup.

597
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,160
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you've ever had, like, a...

598
00:37:32,463 --> 00:37:35,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Cough syrup that coats your mouth or your throat as it goes down.

599
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:36,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Think of that times like a hundred.

600
00:37:37,244 --> 00:37:40,825
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's how the syrup, you can taste it for like the next day.

601
00:37:40,865 --> 00:37:42,266
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still there.

602
00:37:43,146 --> 00:37:44,246
[SPEAKER_08]: I still taste it now.

603
00:37:44,626 --> 00:37:46,147
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's good because it gives me memories.

604
00:37:46,207 --> 00:37:47,267
[SPEAKER_08]: It gives me memories about it.

605
00:37:47,327 --> 00:37:47,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up!

606
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:52,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I jizzed in yours before you drank it.

607
00:37:52,789 --> 00:37:54,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Give the mic back to Loki.

608
00:37:55,069 --> 00:37:57,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Give the mic back to Loki so he can finish telling us about his weakness day.

609
00:37:59,909 --> 00:38:04,777
[SPEAKER_08]: And then today I played more Zelda, but I really don't see a point because I forgot where I was in the game.

610
00:38:05,278 --> 00:38:06,801
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

611
00:38:06,821 --> 00:38:10,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kind of like going island to island going, well, maybe I'm supposed to go here.

612
00:38:10,467 --> 00:38:11,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

613
00:38:14,062 --> 00:38:25,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I also have Mario Kart Double Dash on my PC, but in order to play it on the GameCube here, Rob needs to find his copy of Phantasy Star Online.

614
00:38:25,366 --> 00:38:31,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you can use Phantasy Star Online to play any pirated game on the GameCube.

615
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,588
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.

616
00:38:34,429 --> 00:38:34,769
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

617
00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:35,149
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm done.

618
00:38:36,549 --> 00:38:40,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I guess I'll ask Brad, since he kept butting in on that last one.

619
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:41,311
[SPEAKER_08]: How was your week and how was your day?

620
00:38:41,331 --> 00:38:41,771
[SPEAKER_08]: You already know.

621
00:38:43,157 --> 00:38:44,077
[SPEAKER_08]: But our listeners don't.

622
00:38:44,397 --> 00:38:44,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Like they care.

623
00:38:45,038 --> 00:38:45,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, come on.

624
00:38:46,338 --> 00:38:56,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, I went out in last week, I believe it was, went out and used my wonderful Circuit City credit card and bought a PS2, an American one, because I haven't had one for the longest time.

625
00:38:56,562 --> 00:38:57,502
[SPEAKER_09]: I only had a Japanese one.

626
00:38:57,562 --> 00:39:00,043
[SPEAKER_09]: So I got that in Castlevania because I was fiending.

627
00:39:00,123 --> 00:39:03,124
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to finish Castlevania because I've been bumming it off of you guys here.

628
00:39:04,585 --> 00:39:05,685
[SPEAKER_09]: That's alright, I had to buy it.

629
00:39:06,145 --> 00:39:08,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Matt's saying he'd loan it to me, but that's fine.

630
00:39:09,281 --> 00:39:11,001
[SPEAKER_09]: So I bought it and finished it up.

631
00:39:11,061 --> 00:39:16,222
[SPEAKER_09]: I beat it pretty much every different way you can except for crazy mode because it's crazy and whatnot.

632
00:39:17,103 --> 00:39:18,663
[SPEAKER_09]: I beat it with the two hidden characters.

633
00:39:19,683 --> 00:39:26,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Like four hours is all it took me to beat it with the second hidden character and three hours is all it took me for the first hidden character.

634
00:39:26,245 --> 00:39:27,725
[SPEAKER_09]: You can go through it so freaking fast.

635
00:39:28,525 --> 00:39:29,905
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyhow, so got that.

636
00:39:30,746 --> 00:39:33,666
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got a job interview tomorrow so I will have a life for once.

637
00:39:34,646 --> 00:39:35,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Finally.

638
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:36,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay for me.

639
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:37,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations.

640
00:39:39,181 --> 00:39:43,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm going to work for the man, so... And that's pretty much it.

641
00:39:43,807 --> 00:39:55,101
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a friend over from... Old school friend over for, you know, the weekend and watched movies and... And you got Best Strangers with Candy DVD, so we watched that.

642
00:39:56,162 --> 00:39:56,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god.

643
00:39:58,547 --> 00:40:02,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Please, this is my highest recommendation I could ever give a DVD.

644
00:40:02,931 --> 00:40:06,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Go out and buy The Strangers with Candy Season 1 and Season 2 box sets.

645
00:40:06,715 --> 00:40:09,178
[SPEAKER_08]: I almost peed my pants at that episode we watched last night.

646
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, that was one of the most disturbing things I've done so far.

647
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,164
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the most morbid thing I think I've ever seen on a broadcast television show.

648
00:40:15,304 --> 00:40:16,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's cable, whatever, basic cable.

649
00:40:17,046 --> 00:40:18,727
[SPEAKER_08]: But still, it's... It was great.

650
00:40:18,947 --> 00:40:19,508
[SPEAKER_08]: It was great.

651
00:40:20,049 --> 00:40:21,930
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even want to describe it because I don't want to ruin it, but...

652
00:40:22,831 --> 00:40:24,632
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the funniest shows I've ever seen.

653
00:40:25,273 --> 00:40:26,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously.

654
00:40:26,753 --> 00:40:29,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, we'll watch it after tonight's show.

655
00:40:29,735 --> 00:40:31,656
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll watch that episode because it's just great.

656
00:40:32,617 --> 00:40:36,599
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to go to the bathroom from laughing so hard after the ending of that one.

657
00:40:36,619 --> 00:40:44,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it was like 2 or 3 in the morning and you're like waking up our neighbors.

658
00:40:44,944 --> 00:40:46,465
[SPEAKER_21]: I have an infectious laugh, what can I say?

659
00:40:46,505 --> 00:40:48,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Eddie was pretty loud too when he laughed, so...

660
00:40:49,818 --> 00:40:50,438
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Eddie's laugh.

661
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:51,338
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure we'll talk about this.

662
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:54,019
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish Eddie was here tonight so I could make him laugh so you guys could hear.

663
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:59,020
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure we'll talk about this later, but we also sang karaoke.

664
00:40:59,360 --> 00:40:59,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we'll get to that.

665
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,320
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get to that.

666
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:00,740
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get to that.

667
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

668
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:01,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we'll.

669
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:03,681
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good topic right there.

670
00:41:03,741 --> 00:41:04,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Next segment.

671
00:41:04,201 --> 00:41:04,661
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get to that.

672
00:41:04,721 --> 00:41:04,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

673
00:41:05,121 --> 00:41:06,221
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm awful.

674
00:41:06,261 --> 00:41:07,262
[SPEAKER_09]: So am I, but anyway.

675
00:41:07,962 --> 00:41:08,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

676
00:41:08,942 --> 00:41:10,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else you want to say about your week?

677
00:41:11,643 --> 00:41:16,964
[SPEAKER_09]: And I started playing Final Fantasy X because I am way freaking behind all you people who have played it already.

678
00:41:17,384 --> 00:41:17,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Good for you.

679
00:41:19,753 --> 00:41:20,233
[SPEAKER_08]: I quit.

680
00:41:20,433 --> 00:41:21,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy XI's taken over.

681
00:41:21,894 --> 00:41:23,154
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't go back to Final Fantasy X now.

682
00:41:23,194 --> 00:41:23,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

683
00:41:24,054 --> 00:41:26,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, if I had Final Fantasy XI, I'd be playing that too, so.

684
00:41:27,295 --> 00:41:32,336
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't, because I've got no money, so I'll just play Final Fantasy X until I beat it.

685
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:32,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Good stuff.

686
00:41:34,296 --> 00:41:35,856
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I gotta play Kingdom Hearts, so.

687
00:41:36,277 --> 00:41:37,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm way behind on that too, so.

688
00:41:37,657 --> 00:41:37,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

689
00:41:38,457 --> 00:41:39,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Remind me, I gotta give that to you before you go.

690
00:41:40,177 --> 00:41:40,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, give it to me.

691
00:41:41,578 --> 00:41:42,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Give it to me now!

692
00:41:42,238 --> 00:41:42,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Give it to me in the butt.

693
00:41:43,578 --> 00:41:43,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Ew.

694
00:41:44,218 --> 00:41:44,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

695
00:41:46,219 --> 00:41:46,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

696
00:41:46,499 --> 00:41:48,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Stick your keyblade in my butt.

697
00:41:49,975 --> 00:41:51,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, is that it?

698
00:41:52,837 --> 00:41:53,518
[SPEAKER_09]: What else happened?

699
00:41:53,538 --> 00:41:54,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Did we do anything else?

700
00:41:55,699 --> 00:41:56,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that I remember.

701
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,342
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't do Vanilla Sky this week.

702
00:41:59,402 --> 00:42:00,823
[SPEAKER_08]: We took a week off of Vanilla Sky.

703
00:42:01,103 --> 00:42:05,907
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the way, on a rerun of Vanilla Sky, had our highest listener count ever on the show.

704
00:42:06,047 --> 00:42:07,548
[SPEAKER_08]: And it wasn't even on the right night.

705
00:42:08,229 --> 00:42:10,451
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I know Jamie's show whoops mine in the ratings.

706
00:42:10,471 --> 00:42:12,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we moved to Tuesday for a night and boom!

707
00:42:12,712 --> 00:42:15,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Through the roof, there's a little ego stroking for Jamie.

708
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:17,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Jamie, if you're out there listening.

709
00:42:17,954 --> 00:42:21,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, is somebody asking me if I'm going to play X2?

710
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:22,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Or is somebody asking somebody else?

711
00:42:23,136 --> 00:42:25,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's pretend they're asking you.

712
00:42:25,237 --> 00:42:26,477
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to play Final Fantasy X2?

713
00:42:26,757 --> 00:42:28,998
[SPEAKER_09]: I was not interested at all when I saw this.

714
00:42:29,018 --> 00:42:29,879
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, what the hell?

715
00:42:29,899 --> 00:42:33,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's just make the three main characters girls that dress weirdly and stuff.

716
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:38,583
[SPEAKER_09]: But after reading about it and how they're going to have a job system and stuff like that, it sounds interesting.

717
00:42:38,843 --> 00:42:51,330
[SPEAKER_09]: I still, since I haven't gone through Final Fantasy X yet, I don't understand what the connection is, but I noticed a lot of the characters are missing from Final Fantasy X. Yeah, and they can piss my fat ass for not having Lulu, a playable character.

718
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:53,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Lulu's going to be in it, but she's not a playable character.

719
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:55,971
[SPEAKER_09]: What I'm pissed off is, where's Oren?

720
00:42:56,231 --> 00:43:02,573
[SPEAKER_09]: And don't say, I know people are going to probably sit there in the chat room and spoil it for me, because you guys all suck.

721
00:43:02,893 --> 00:43:05,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, remember, Brad and I have not beat Final Fantasy X yet.

722
00:43:05,774 --> 00:43:09,794
[SPEAKER_09]: I've picked up on some things that might be happening, but let's not spoil, okay?

723
00:43:09,815 --> 00:43:11,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I don't know.

724
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:13,135
[SPEAKER_09]: So I will play it if you were asking me.

725
00:43:13,175 --> 00:43:14,816
[SPEAKER_09]: If you weren't asking me, I don't fucking care.

726
00:43:15,036 --> 00:43:15,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck you.

727
00:43:15,996 --> 00:43:17,037
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll tell you my opinion anyway.

728
00:43:18,578 --> 00:43:18,798
Sorry.

729
00:43:19,078 --> 00:43:19,479
[SPEAKER_09]: That's alright.

730
00:43:19,499 --> 00:43:20,099
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really not curious.

731
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:21,560
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just angsty in real life.

732
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:22,060
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you are.

733
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:22,661
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to get excited.

734
00:43:22,881 --> 00:43:23,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck you!

735
00:43:23,922 --> 00:43:24,222
[SPEAKER_08]: See?

736
00:43:24,242 --> 00:43:26,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Please.

737
00:43:27,444 --> 00:43:28,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, um, Will!

738
00:43:30,006 --> 00:43:30,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Will!

739
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:31,067
[SPEAKER_08]: How you doing?

740
00:43:31,507 --> 00:43:31,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Slinky.

741
00:43:32,508 --> 00:43:33,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Slinky wizard.

742
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:36,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you still slinky wizard or just slinky now?

743
00:43:37,332 --> 00:43:37,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

744
00:43:40,163 --> 00:43:40,543
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

745
00:43:40,603 --> 00:43:42,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Such an apathetic little teen you are.

746
00:43:42,504 --> 00:43:42,944
[SPEAKER_06]: God.

747
00:43:42,984 --> 00:43:43,804
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care anymore.

748
00:43:43,824 --> 00:43:44,285
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter.

749
00:43:44,325 --> 00:43:45,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, how was your week?

750
00:43:45,045 --> 00:43:45,965
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your day?

751
00:43:47,226 --> 00:43:48,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, high school.

752
00:43:49,186 --> 00:43:53,208
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, high school is high school, and high school sucks.

753
00:43:55,449 --> 00:43:58,810
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, on Tuesday, I got my license, barely.

754
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:00,211
[SPEAKER_06]: Missed 11.

755
00:44:00,551 --> 00:44:01,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

756
00:44:02,331 --> 00:44:03,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, what score is that? 89?

757
00:44:05,952 --> 00:44:07,653
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the most you can miss is like 13 or 15.

758
00:44:07,693 --> 00:44:07,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

759
00:44:08,033 --> 00:44:09,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

760
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:12,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, on the written test?

761
00:44:12,655 --> 00:44:14,116
[SPEAKER_08]: The driving test.

762
00:44:14,837 --> 00:44:15,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

763
00:44:15,237 --> 00:44:18,338
[SPEAKER_08]: God, you used to be able to get a 70 and still pass, because I got an 80.

764
00:44:18,618 --> 00:44:21,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they're evil.

765
00:44:23,221 --> 00:44:24,661
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a B- in driving.

766
00:44:24,801 --> 00:44:28,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I got like a 70, I got like the lowest you can get.

767
00:44:29,163 --> 00:44:29,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's what happened.

768
00:44:30,911 --> 00:44:54,219
[SPEAKER_09]: I got, uh, let's see how we did this, I got knocked off probably four points, so I probably would have had like a 90-something, and I finished the entire test, and I parked, and I parked like shit, I parked all crooked and stuff, and I didn't take any points off that, and we're right about to go inside and get my license, because I got like a 90-something percent, and he's like, actually, you didn't move your head enough, and then knocks off like 20 points, I was like,

769
00:44:55,177 --> 00:44:57,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Was he just mad because you weren't moving your head up and down his crotch?

770
00:44:57,738 --> 00:45:02,060
[SPEAKER_09]: I was moving my head like this, and this is only for the people in the studio because you guys, you know, over there can't hear it.

771
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,480
[SPEAKER_09]: You can kind of see on the cam.

772
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:11,243
[SPEAKER_09]: But I was moving my head like this because you have to look, you know, you have to look down a street when you drive through intersections and you look down both sides.

773
00:45:11,563 --> 00:45:12,383
[SPEAKER_09]: I was moving my head like this.

774
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:13,944
[SPEAKER_09]: He wanted me to move my head like this.

775
00:45:17,017 --> 00:45:20,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you take it at Florin or something?

776
00:45:20,038 --> 00:45:20,398
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that?

777
00:45:20,418 --> 00:45:21,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you take it at Florin Mall?

778
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:26,200
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I did this in Auburn, my hometown.

779
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,581
[SPEAKER_09]: My little hick town, Auburn, where all the races are.

780
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:30,121
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

781
00:45:30,481 --> 00:45:32,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, so, yeah, but I barely passed.

782
00:45:32,942 --> 00:45:37,083
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've never been in an accident, except for somebody who ran in the back of me.

783
00:45:38,684 --> 00:45:39,224
[SPEAKER_09]: We all know.

784
00:45:39,884 --> 00:45:40,544
[SPEAKER_07]: I took mine.

785
00:45:40,744 --> 00:45:43,565
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a 70 the day after I got in a car accident.

786
00:45:45,065 --> 00:45:46,706
[SPEAKER_08]: The only car accident I've ever been in.

787
00:45:49,082 --> 00:45:49,983
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, enough tangents.

788
00:45:50,043 --> 00:45:51,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Let Will finish his story.

789
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:53,445
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyways, hi, Angel.

790
00:45:55,306 --> 00:45:57,508
[SPEAKER_08]: See, she says, never mind.

791
00:45:57,788 --> 00:46:01,130
[SPEAKER_08]: I just would like to reiterate, those of you in the chat room, we can see you on the TV.

792
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:04,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody here can see you on the TV, loud and clear.

793
00:46:04,072 --> 00:46:09,856
[SPEAKER_08]: And Vandalist even has his laptop, and he's in the chat room, you know, talking smack about us when we're not looking at the TV.

794
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:10,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kidding.

795
00:46:11,517 --> 00:46:15,199
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so then, you know, just finish out school or whatever and...

796
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:25,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty much just been driving around all weekend and trying to cause trouble and stuff like that.

797
00:46:26,627 --> 00:46:27,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Fun stuff.

798
00:46:29,269 --> 00:46:29,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

799
00:46:30,589 --> 00:46:31,130
[SPEAKER_06]: That's about it.

800
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, cool deal.

801
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:33,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you played A&DDR at all lately?

802
00:46:35,132 --> 00:46:35,833
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I haven't.

803
00:46:37,034 --> 00:46:37,834
[SPEAKER_08]: No, actually no.

804
00:46:37,874 --> 00:46:40,876
[SPEAKER_08]: We went on Thursday and I did play two games.

805
00:46:41,417 --> 00:46:42,337
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm working on my doubles.

806
00:46:42,577 --> 00:46:44,919
[SPEAKER_08]: For some reason I'm in this mood where I have to play doubles.

807
00:46:46,308 --> 00:46:47,509
[SPEAKER_06]: But enough about me, what about you?

808
00:46:47,549 --> 00:46:48,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I went Saturday morning.

809
00:46:49,531 --> 00:46:49,792
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

810
00:46:50,012 --> 00:46:55,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Just for the hell of it, and... Yeah, I haven't been in a while, so... I was sore.

811
00:46:56,018 --> 00:46:56,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Fun stuff.

812
00:46:57,299 --> 00:47:03,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you find that when you haven't played in a while, like when you start playing those katas back to back, you're like... Yeah.

813
00:47:03,305 --> 00:47:04,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's me.

814
00:47:04,507 --> 00:47:04,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Smoker.

815
00:47:05,187 --> 00:47:05,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Smokers.

816
00:47:05,928 --> 00:47:07,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Well... Yeah.

817
00:47:07,349 --> 00:47:08,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you take up smoking?

818
00:47:08,411 --> 00:47:08,591
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

819
00:47:08,811 --> 00:47:09,231
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, okay.

820
00:47:09,291 --> 00:47:09,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I just...

821
00:47:10,945 --> 00:47:13,467
[SPEAKER_21]: I see Terry sitting on the computer, so I'll go to Bradley.

822
00:47:13,507 --> 00:47:14,587
[SPEAKER_08]: If we can get a mic over to Bradley.

823
00:47:14,607 --> 00:47:15,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we get a mic over to Bradley?

824
00:47:15,408 --> 00:47:17,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Bradley, how was your week and how was your day?

825
00:47:39,448 --> 00:47:41,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Mostly blah, of course, as usual.

826
00:47:42,511 --> 00:47:44,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Monday, it was not much.

827
00:47:45,513 --> 00:47:49,257
[SPEAKER_10]: Tuesday, I called a temp agency and set up an appointment.

828
00:47:50,358 --> 00:47:52,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Wednesday, did more crap.

829
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,140
[SPEAKER_10]: More crap.

830
00:47:55,460 --> 00:48:03,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Thursday I went to this temp agency, basically an accounting type temp agency, maybe find a data entry job or something of that sort.

831
00:48:03,823 --> 00:48:06,403
[SPEAKER_10]: And I did well enough on their Excel test.

832
00:48:06,523 --> 00:48:11,905
[SPEAKER_10]: They basically gave me the advanced accounting test instead of the basic one they were supposed to give me.

833
00:48:12,785 --> 00:48:17,126
[SPEAKER_10]: But I did well enough on that, even though I had studied accounting terms the day before.

834
00:48:19,023 --> 00:48:23,646
[SPEAKER_10]: It also gave me an Excel test, so he said, hey, you did well enough on this, why don't you go take the certification?

835
00:48:24,166 --> 00:48:25,527
[SPEAKER_10]: So I took that and passed that.

836
00:48:26,707 --> 00:48:31,470
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I'm certified now for the general, like the specialist.

837
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:34,472
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Friday, didn't do much of anything.

838
00:48:35,332 --> 00:48:36,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Set up eBay auctions and such.

839
00:48:37,533 --> 00:48:40,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Then Saturday, I went and saw The Matrix in Davis.

840
00:48:45,979 --> 00:48:47,259
[SPEAKER_10]: and watch The Matrix.

841
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:52,121
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was sort of just sitting there watching it.

842
00:48:52,581 --> 00:48:54,421
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if I was really paying attention to it.

843
00:48:54,441 --> 00:48:56,682
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just like, ooh, pretty things.

844
00:48:57,382 --> 00:48:58,962
[SPEAKER_10]: Like ships flying around.

845
00:48:59,702 --> 00:49:03,603
[SPEAKER_10]: The action scenes were good, but the dialogue scenes were kind of stupid.

846
00:49:05,064 --> 00:49:07,864
[SPEAKER_10]: So I sort of liked it and sort of didn't like it.

847
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:11,325
[SPEAKER_10]: And then today, more crap.

848
00:49:11,885 --> 00:49:13,006
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's basically everything.

849
00:49:16,403 --> 00:49:16,743
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

850
00:49:19,726 --> 00:49:22,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Then let's go over to Terry and see how your week was.

851
00:49:22,389 --> 00:49:23,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me start by answering this.

852
00:49:23,951 --> 00:49:27,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, I am... My week has been very busy.

853
00:49:27,554 --> 00:49:29,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, look, there's boobies on the webcam.

854
00:49:30,858 --> 00:49:31,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Boobies on cam!

855
00:49:32,379 --> 00:49:37,544
[SPEAKER_08]: And how that's possible when there's no women here tonight, I have no idea, but go ahead.

856
00:49:37,564 --> 00:49:38,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Brad, stop showing the boobies.

857
00:49:40,157 --> 00:49:41,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I've been very busy at work.

858
00:49:42,098 --> 00:49:48,321
[SPEAKER_04]: We're hiring for a new position in my team, and so I'm going to bore you guys on my work.

859
00:49:48,921 --> 00:49:55,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Bull crap, because that's what I'm dealing with, is hiring new people and being in a new organization and fun stuff like that.

860
00:49:56,384 --> 00:49:57,705
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, I watched...

861
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:29,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Matrix Reloaded or Matrix Revolutions if you don't see my LJ which is vandalist.livejournal.com nice plug and that is we watched IMAX or Revolutions on IMAX ah how was that it was freaking unbelievable I bet I bet even a shit movie would be great on IMAX the Defense of Zion if you've seen this movie and you watch it on a regular show on a regular screen you go watch it on IMAX it just blows you away the Defense of Zion is unbelievable on that screen I bet

862
00:50:30,049 --> 00:50:39,775
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, the other kind of cool thing about going down there was we had one of my friend's roommates go with us, and he's a guy that'll do anything if you start giving him a little alcohol.

863
00:50:40,416 --> 00:50:40,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, goody.

864
00:50:41,216 --> 00:50:44,399
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this guy is about 240 pounds, about 5'7".

865
00:50:44,419 --> 00:50:46,960
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got about the geekiest glasses you can find.

866
00:50:48,221 --> 00:50:51,063
[SPEAKER_04]: And they got him to take two triple shots of tequila.

867
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,881
[SPEAKER_04]: and so his ears were pretty red.

868
00:50:54,081 --> 00:50:56,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, he's over 21 and all that, you know, this is completely legal.

869
00:50:56,763 --> 00:50:58,143
[SPEAKER_21]: Of course, yes, completely legal.

870
00:50:58,523 --> 00:51:01,665
[SPEAKER_04]: And he proceeded to, they convinced him to take off his shirt.

871
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,586
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, okay, this is Gordon Biersch.

872
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:04,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my.

873
00:51:04,086 --> 00:51:05,747
[SPEAKER_04]: You know where Gordon Biersch is on San Francisco?

874
00:51:05,787 --> 00:51:10,670
[SPEAKER_04]: It's right on the corner from Barcadero and Harrison, which is right by his peers.

875
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:17,033
[SPEAKER_04]: And he took a box out of a trash can, he took off his shirt and proceeded to belly flop it for us.

876
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,262
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a nice light rail going by.

877
00:51:21,182 --> 00:51:25,666
[SPEAKER_04]: It was about 3 o'clock in the afternoon in San Francisco on a Wednesday.

878
00:51:28,108 --> 00:51:32,312
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we needed webcams because we really wanted to capture this and put this on eBay.

879
00:51:32,332 --> 00:51:34,754
[SPEAKER_04]: He would have been the next Star Wars kid.

880
00:51:35,594 --> 00:51:37,816
[SPEAKER_04]: But we were unable to do that.

881
00:51:38,416 --> 00:51:42,540
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure someone will post a link to Star Wars Kid if someone starts asking questions.

882
00:51:44,221 --> 00:51:44,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that...

883
00:51:45,868 --> 00:51:47,889
[SPEAKER_04]: My week has been just busy with work stuff and everything.

884
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:51,952
[SPEAKER_04]: And family stuff and home stuff and boring stuff.

885
00:51:52,512 --> 00:51:56,615
[SPEAKER_04]: But I managed to make it here because I actually had... I'm a day shifter next week.

886
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:57,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I work nights.

887
00:51:58,502 --> 00:51:59,183
[SPEAKER_04]: I work 11 p.m.

888
00:51:59,203 --> 00:51:59,683
[SPEAKER_04]: to 8 a.m.

889
00:51:59,723 --> 00:52:01,184
[SPEAKER_04]: if you can imagine that at the Vampire Shift.

890
00:52:01,445 --> 00:52:01,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

891
00:52:02,566 --> 00:52:05,048
[SPEAKER_08]: My old roommate used to work at Vampire Shift, but it was at Walmart.

892
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:06,609
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't a job nearly as cool as yours.

893
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:10,132
[SPEAKER_04]: It was enjoyable, though.

894
00:52:10,152 --> 00:52:11,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I like working nights and everything.

895
00:52:11,193 --> 00:52:11,534
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice.

896
00:52:12,014 --> 00:52:16,598
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've got to be on day shift all this week because I've got to hire somebody and do all that fun stuff.

897
00:52:16,879 --> 00:52:17,379
[SPEAKER_21]: I got you.

898
00:52:17,819 --> 00:52:18,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, that's about it.

899
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Boring.

900
00:52:19,941 --> 00:52:21,703
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's good to have you here.

901
00:52:22,398 --> 00:52:25,659
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad that they switched you to day shift so we could get a chance to have you here.

902
00:52:25,719 --> 00:52:29,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though you may not like day shift, I'm glad for our own selfish reasons we finally got you on the show.

903
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:30,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you.

904
00:52:30,501 --> 00:52:31,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad to be here.

905
00:52:31,382 --> 00:52:31,682
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fun.

906
00:52:31,702 --> 00:52:32,002
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

907
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:32,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

908
00:52:33,322 --> 00:52:37,284
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as my week and my day, nothing too exciting.

909
00:52:37,504 --> 00:52:41,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Thursday went out to Golf Land, and I've been working on my doubles game.

910
00:52:42,266 --> 00:52:49,689
[SPEAKER_08]: I noticed there was one high score list for one of the doubles that had no scores on it, so I thought I'd play just to get my name on it, so that was kind of funny.

911
00:52:51,309 --> 00:52:52,330
[SPEAKER_08]: My ego talking there.

912
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:55,291
[SPEAKER_08]: And what else did I do this week?

913
00:52:56,092 --> 00:52:57,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really a whole heck of a lot.

914
00:52:57,512 --> 00:52:59,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Just been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XI.

915
00:53:00,013 --> 00:53:01,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Shane, if you're out there, hello.

916
00:53:01,374 --> 00:53:03,175
[SPEAKER_08]: He's my buddy out in Kansas.

917
00:53:03,215 --> 00:53:06,176
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been playing Final Fantasy XI non-stop through the thing.

918
00:53:06,557 --> 00:53:08,658
[SPEAKER_08]: And the nice thing is we've been using this program, TeamSpeak.

919
00:53:09,998 --> 00:53:11,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Vandalus, you're a big multiplayer game player.

920
00:53:12,039 --> 00:53:13,400
[SPEAKER_08]: You probably know about this one, right?

921
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:19,223
[SPEAKER_08]: TeamSpeak, the one that allows you... It basically turns your computer into Xbox Live, where you can use the microphone to talk to people and stuff like that.

922
00:53:19,263 --> 00:53:19,703
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's cool.

923
00:53:20,887 --> 00:53:31,833
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I haven't really gone into too much detail about Final Fantasy XI yet, that's because I still, even after two weeks of playing the game, I still feel like I have not scratched the surface.

924
00:53:31,893 --> 00:53:35,135
[SPEAKER_08]: There's just so much more to discover in the game, and it's just so...

925
00:53:35,925 --> 00:53:36,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Just vast.

926
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:37,566
[SPEAKER_08]: There's so much to it.

927
00:53:38,227 --> 00:53:40,068
[SPEAKER_08]: It's unlike any other Final Fantasy game.

928
00:53:40,289 --> 00:53:45,853
[SPEAKER_08]: I still say it's kind of odd that they chose to go with Final Fantasy XI as opposed to Final Fantasy Online.

929
00:53:46,353 --> 00:53:48,135
[SPEAKER_08]: But other than that, I mean, the game's terrific.

930
00:53:48,195 --> 00:53:50,336
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just not what a lot of you are going to expect.

931
00:53:50,637 --> 00:53:52,338
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all.

932
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:56,461
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was pretty much my week and my day.

933
00:53:56,521 --> 00:53:58,343
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't get to go see any cool movies or anything.

934
00:53:59,333 --> 00:54:01,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Last night hung out with the out-of-town buddy who was here.

935
00:54:01,815 --> 00:54:08,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Played a lot of Karaoke Revolution and iToy, the new webcam tool for the PS2, is out.

936
00:54:08,539 --> 00:54:09,799
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've been playing iToy a lot.

937
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:15,463
[SPEAKER_08]: And those of you that sit in our chat room during the week saw a random webcam was up on, I think, Thursday night.

938
00:54:15,803 --> 00:54:17,184
[SPEAKER_08]: We were playing iToy and all that stuff.

939
00:54:17,204 --> 00:54:19,405
[SPEAKER_04]: So now they have a webcam for PS2?

940
00:54:19,425 --> 00:54:21,506
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a webcam for PS2 with games and everything.

941
00:54:21,666 --> 00:54:22,227
[SPEAKER_04]: That is really sweet.

942
00:54:22,267 --> 00:54:24,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe towards the end of the show we'll hook it up or something.

943
00:54:24,248 --> 00:54:25,429
[SPEAKER_04]: OMG hi hi to you.

944
00:54:26,489 --> 00:54:28,089
[SPEAKER_04]: All of a sudden, it's taking a whole new level.

945
00:54:28,149 --> 00:54:31,290
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to 8-year-olds on PS2s now.

946
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:36,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, they have this thing where you can do the video messaging on it, but it doesn't make sense because you save it on your memory card.

947
00:54:37,372 --> 00:54:40,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I'm hearing that you can use your broadband to do it, but I didn't see an option for it.

948
00:54:41,673 --> 00:54:50,955
[SPEAKER_08]: What would end up happening is you save it as a file, and then you upload it as an attachment to your email through broadband.

949
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:52,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Get what I'm saying?

950
00:54:53,389 --> 00:54:53,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

951
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:58,472
[SPEAKER_08]: So then you would download it to your memory card using whatever software they have for the PS2.

952
00:54:58,652 --> 00:54:59,572
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really know.

953
00:55:00,533 --> 00:55:04,554
[SPEAKER_08]: And then that way you can say, hey, fuck you, and then that would be an attachment.

954
00:55:05,115 --> 00:55:14,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you imagine the social hacking you can do with that by convincing these kids, hey, turn on your camera and click on this really cool link?

955
00:55:15,059 --> 00:55:18,881
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of a sudden you can get all kinds of really fun voyeur stuff going on in the house.

956
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:27,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go out to the street and find a couple of whores and make the first eye toy porn.

957
00:55:40,174 --> 00:55:43,595
[SPEAKER_08]: No, or like, you remember how they have the little rainbow feature and stuff?

958
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:46,436
[SPEAKER_08]: The guy does the cum shot and it's all rainbow-y behind it.

959
00:55:47,196 --> 00:55:48,637
[SPEAKER_08]: How about iToy Fight Club?

960
00:55:48,817 --> 00:55:53,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, see, somebody's telling me that the longest you can do a video on iToy is one minute.

961
00:55:53,678 --> 00:55:54,158
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

962
00:55:54,578 --> 00:55:56,659
[SPEAKER_08]: One minute's long enough for some guys.

963
00:55:56,719 --> 00:55:57,499
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a money shot.

964
00:56:01,221 --> 00:56:02,501
[SPEAKER_02]: We not only invent...

965
00:56:03,248 --> 00:56:05,209
[SPEAKER_02]: A new form of, you know, internet porn.

966
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:08,272
[SPEAKER_02]: We can invent a whole new porn genre.

967
00:56:08,552 --> 00:56:09,733
[SPEAKER_02]: The one minute porn.

968
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:15,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Film it in segments, just like, you know, like 24, you know, where it's like five second segments or whatever.

969
00:56:16,097 --> 00:56:16,978
[SPEAKER_08]: We really need Brad.

970
00:56:17,878 --> 00:56:18,399
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's not here.

971
00:56:18,919 --> 00:56:20,860
[SPEAKER_04]: To be able to provide some commentary to this.

972
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:21,661
[SPEAKER_08]: That's alright.

973
00:56:22,942 --> 00:56:24,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, he'll, we can, we can ask him later.

974
00:56:25,103 --> 00:56:25,624
[SPEAKER_08]: If we remember.

975
00:56:26,004 --> 00:56:27,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Angel's got a good comparison though.

976
00:56:27,485 --> 00:56:31,668
[SPEAKER_08]: She says, EyeToy reminds her of when, remember the old game show Nick Arcade?

977
00:56:33,488 --> 00:56:37,691
[SPEAKER_08]: They would go inside the game and they'd have to do some kind of stupid thing inside the game.

978
00:56:37,971 --> 00:56:39,932
[SPEAKER_08]: She says the eye toy totally reminds her of that.

979
00:56:40,032 --> 00:56:41,753
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think she's right on the money.

980
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:43,394
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's a damn good comparison.

981
00:56:43,774 --> 00:56:46,355
[SPEAKER_08]: The eye toy is like the last level of Nick Arcade.

982
00:56:46,495 --> 00:56:47,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Wouldn't you say so, Loki?

983
00:56:49,177 --> 00:56:56,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if by making that comparison, if you're saying it looks like bumbling idiots playing the game, yes.

984
00:56:56,941 --> 00:56:59,262
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be a perfect comparison.

985
00:57:00,743 --> 00:57:01,063
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

986
00:57:02,938 --> 00:57:05,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so I think what we're going to do now is we're going to go ahead and take a break.

987
00:57:05,521 --> 00:57:08,263
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to do some more Poppin' Music Part 10 music.

988
00:57:08,303 --> 00:57:12,247
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we come back, we're going to talk about karaoke revolutions all the rage this week.

989
00:57:12,267 --> 00:57:13,568
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to give our thoughts on that.

990
00:57:14,149 --> 00:57:15,971
[SPEAKER_08]: And Cage Match, too, when we come back.

991
00:57:16,846 --> 00:57:23,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, in this break, from the Poppin' 10 music soundtrack, you're going to hear the new Revenge song.

992
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:28,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Naoki's little pseudonym, Revenge, has a new song on the Poppin' Music 10 soundtrack.

993
00:57:29,174 --> 00:57:32,716
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called Erebatia, and it's an Arab song.

994
00:57:33,596 --> 00:57:34,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Erebatia, or something like that.

995
00:57:35,017 --> 00:57:35,858
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we're going to hear...

996
00:57:37,188 --> 00:57:44,013
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to hear something called Como Tomac by a group called Artemis, and it's in the genre of lonely.

997
00:57:44,373 --> 00:57:51,579
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we're going to hear something in the genre of symphonic metal, and the song is called Holy Forest, and the artist is... Holy Forest!

998
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:52,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Holy Forest, Batman!

999
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,741
[SPEAKER_08]: And the artist is Sarastro.

1000
00:57:54,761 --> 00:57:58,384
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to start it off with Revenge here on Poppin' Music 10 Break.

1001
00:57:58,404 --> 00:57:59,585
[SPEAKER_08]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1002
00:57:59,665 --> 00:58:00,085
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back.

1003
00:59:14,141 --> 00:59:15,113
Thanks for watching!

1004
01:00:02,662 --> 01:00:09,727
[SPEAKER_13]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1005
01:01:15,015 --> 01:01:16,219
Thank you for watching!

1006
01:01:50,114 --> 01:01:51,215
Thank you for watching!

1007
01:02:25,499 --> 01:02:26,341
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

1008
01:02:44,136 --> 01:02:50,869
[SPEAKER_13]: The legend, keep your face, to stand with the evil back into the night, that will change you all.

1009
01:03:39,962 --> 01:03:45,804
[SPEAKER_20]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

1010
01:03:47,225 --> 01:03:49,305
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1011
01:03:56,115 --> 01:04:00,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Some more music in that break from the Poppin' Music 10 soundtrack.

1012
01:04:01,459 --> 01:04:04,081
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you guys think of some of those songs here?

1013
01:04:04,121 --> 01:04:06,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's start off with the Revenge track.

1014
01:04:06,422 --> 01:04:07,683
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Arabatia.

1015
01:04:07,703 --> 01:04:08,584
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you guys think of that one?

1016
01:04:10,305 --> 01:04:10,945
[SPEAKER_08]: It was interesting.

1017
01:04:10,985 --> 01:04:13,027
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds just like a exotic ethnic song.

1018
01:04:13,207 --> 01:04:14,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking Max Unlimited samples.

1019
01:04:15,629 --> 01:04:18,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, they need to get away from Max Unlimited.

1020
01:04:19,371 --> 01:04:19,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I agree.

1021
01:04:19,912 --> 01:04:21,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop remaking the song.

1022
01:04:21,753 --> 01:04:22,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Let the Max die.

1023
01:04:23,094 --> 01:04:24,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Step away from the Max.

1024
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:27,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, good stuff.

1025
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:31,032
[SPEAKER_09]: It's exotic ethnic, which is already good, so, good stuff.

1026
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:34,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever, if they want to use samples from other songs, it's fine with me.

1027
01:04:34,535 --> 01:04:38,898
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, all these popular European and American DJs constantly use samples.

1028
01:04:38,938 --> 01:04:40,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but they use good samples.

1029
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:42,241
[SPEAKER_09]: That's such a bad sample.

1030
01:04:42,301 --> 01:04:45,363
[SPEAKER_09]: That sample right there makes me really pissed off at the song.

1031
01:04:46,144 --> 01:04:46,684
[SPEAKER_09]: It does!

1032
01:04:47,204 --> 01:04:53,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like the ending of Matrix Revolutions, how they fucked up that song and made fun of the Hindus and stuff.

1033
01:04:53,089 --> 01:04:54,110
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes me hate the movie.

1034
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:54,310
[SPEAKER_09]: God.

1035
01:04:54,730 --> 01:04:57,092
[SPEAKER_09]: God, some people.

1036
01:04:57,733 --> 01:04:58,573
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't even seen the movie.

1037
01:04:58,593 --> 01:05:13,286
[SPEAKER_08]: What bothered me, what kind of irks me about Arbatia, it's a decent song, it's kind of fun, it's one of the better songs in the soundtrack, but I still picture Revenge as always doing these DDR songs and stuff, and there's no kind of backbeat to it, so I can't imagine myself dancing to it.

1038
01:05:13,606 --> 01:05:15,688
[SPEAKER_08]: And for some reason, that makes me not like it as much.

1039
01:05:15,708 --> 01:05:16,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen to the bag.

1040
01:05:17,592 --> 01:05:17,973
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.

1041
01:05:34,198 --> 01:05:34,758
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fine.

1042
01:05:34,818 --> 01:05:43,484
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, Revenge has always been Naoki's, you know, trying to attempt to do, like, ethnic-sounding music, and that's fine if it doesn't have a beat.

1043
01:05:43,824 --> 01:05:45,585
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why it's in poppin' music and not DDR.

1044
01:05:46,706 --> 01:05:47,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

1045
01:05:47,246 --> 01:05:47,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1046
01:05:48,267 --> 01:05:54,031
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, the next song was from a group called Komo Tomak, and that's the genre of Lonely, and it's Artemis.

1047
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:59,374
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's actually a long version of this on the Poppin' Music 10 soundtrack.

1048
01:05:59,434 --> 01:06:00,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Any thoughts on that?

1049
01:06:00,815 --> 01:06:01,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, where's Luna?

1050
01:06:02,464 --> 01:06:04,094
[SPEAKER_08]: and Sailor Moon and Sailor Mercury.

1051
01:06:07,674 --> 01:06:08,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1052
01:06:08,074 --> 01:06:10,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it does kind of sound like that anime theme.

1053
01:06:10,856 --> 01:06:11,836
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, Artemis.

1054
01:06:12,237 --> 01:06:13,137
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to watch Sailor Moon.

1055
01:06:13,917 --> 01:06:14,458
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't watch.

1056
01:06:14,598 --> 01:06:18,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Artemis is... Yes, you do have to watch Sailor Moon.

1057
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:27,105
[SPEAKER_09]: I got the live-action Sailor Moon episodes that are just newly showing in Japan, and it's some of the greatest, like, stupid, silly stuff.

1058
01:06:27,225 --> 01:06:28,205
[SPEAKER_08]: That I will watch.

1059
01:06:28,405 --> 01:06:29,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Send it on over.

1060
01:06:29,466 --> 01:06:31,867
[SPEAKER_09]: We showed the first episode to Eddie, and he was crying.

1061
01:06:31,907 --> 01:06:32,567
[SPEAKER_09]: It was so funny.

1062
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:33,608
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to see it.

1063
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:35,329
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, it's so cheesy.

1064
01:06:35,389 --> 01:06:37,170
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, as he says, ill-conceived.

1065
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:39,151
[SPEAKER_08]: It can't be better than Strangers with Candy, though.

1066
01:06:39,431 --> 01:06:42,091
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well, no, it's not trying to be funny.

1067
01:06:42,731 --> 01:06:43,972
[SPEAKER_08]: It's funny because it's stupid.

1068
01:06:44,052 --> 01:06:49,193
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought you were telling me that the people that translated it or did the fan sub or whatever, that they tried to make it funny.

1069
01:06:49,253 --> 01:06:49,973
[SPEAKER_08]: They skimped.

1070
01:06:50,353 --> 01:06:50,894
[SPEAKER_09]: They skimped.

1071
01:06:51,434 --> 01:06:52,294
[SPEAKER_09]: They did some parody.

1072
01:06:52,314 --> 01:06:55,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, they left in some commercials that are showing on the...

1073
01:06:56,744 --> 01:06:58,986
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll Always Be Watching You Especially When You're In The Bathroom

1074
01:07:28,426 --> 01:07:46,563
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there's this other one where it's these girls in panties, little girls wearing diapers, and it's a diaper commercial or something, and it says, Pantsu Faito, Pantsu Faito, and at the end it goes, Buy these panties, guaranteed pre-worn by a pedalicious girl, just like this one.

1075
01:07:47,797 --> 01:08:09,819
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so great, or the Sailor Moon, like, the memorabilia they sell, like these wands and stuff, oh yeah, but they sell the memorabilia, and it's like, what does he say, buy our Sailor Moon toys so you can transform, just like Sailor Moon, and then at the end it goes, successful transformation, not guaranteed.

1076
01:08:13,746 --> 01:08:20,229
[SPEAKER_09]: or the Hello Kitty one where it's like, Hello Kitty, Hello Kitty, or it's like, I don't know, something Nico, you know, Hello Kitty, Hello Kitty.

1077
01:08:20,509 --> 01:08:29,174
[SPEAKER_09]: At the bottom it says, Evil Kitty, Evil Kitty, Evil Kitty, and then it's like, buy Evil Kitty mind control candy so we can control your kids and stuff like that.

1078
01:08:29,254 --> 01:08:30,235
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great.

1079
01:08:31,776 --> 01:08:32,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1080
01:08:32,676 --> 01:08:37,579
[SPEAKER_08]: The last song we heard in that break was Sastro with Holy Forest.

1081
01:08:42,342 --> 01:08:44,103
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you think of that?

1082
01:09:03,149 --> 01:09:05,410
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1083
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:22,801
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Taka, Attack

1084
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:55,281
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, why put... whatever, I don't know.

1085
01:09:55,822 --> 01:09:56,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Konami's kind of losing their mind.

1086
01:09:58,063 --> 01:09:58,543
[SPEAKER_09]: So, whatever.

1087
01:10:00,143 --> 01:10:00,424
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1088
01:10:01,524 --> 01:10:04,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so that was the Music in a Poppin' Tin soundtrack.

1089
01:10:05,266 --> 01:10:08,627
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll do some more later, but first, this is all the rage this week.

1090
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:13,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Out now, just came out this week, a brand new Bomani game.

1091
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:13,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

1092
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:20,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Something brand new, and it's not in the arcades, it's only for the home, and America Shock got it first.

1093
01:10:21,112 --> 01:10:21,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Karaoke Revolution, out this week.

1094
01:10:40,623 --> 01:10:42,324
[SPEAKER_08]: What are your guys' impressions of Karaoke Revolution?

1095
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:44,964
[SPEAKER_08]: First, does somebody want to try and describe the game?

1096
01:10:44,984 --> 01:10:48,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I know not even all of us here have played it yet, but does somebody want to try and describe the game?

1097
01:10:48,906 --> 01:10:49,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Like how it plays?

1098
01:10:49,626 --> 01:10:50,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, how it plays.

1099
01:10:50,326 --> 01:10:52,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I think a lot of people still haven't gotten how it works yet.

1100
01:10:52,567 --> 01:10:53,467
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to try and explain it, Brad?

1101
01:10:53,787 --> 01:10:54,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I can't.

1102
01:10:54,147 --> 01:10:55,487
[SPEAKER_08]: First, you go to the store and you shell out $70.

1103
01:10:55,908 --> 01:10:57,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, after that.

1104
01:10:57,208 --> 01:10:57,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1105
01:10:57,848 --> 01:11:00,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you bring it home and you look at it, you oogle it.

1106
01:11:00,129 --> 01:11:00,469
[SPEAKER_08]: After that.

1107
01:11:01,349 --> 01:11:06,171
[SPEAKER_09]: You get a microphone headset combination like what Britney Spears and Madonna uses.

1108
01:11:06,652 --> 01:11:09,133
[SPEAKER_09]: You put this thing on, and you go into it, okay?

1109
01:11:09,313 --> 01:11:14,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, it's got like a... You pick levels.

1110
01:11:14,876 --> 01:11:18,297
[SPEAKER_09]: You pick a song, and you pick a level, and it's got like a crowd of people.

1111
01:11:18,337 --> 01:11:19,498
[SPEAKER_09]: There's like a band behind you.

1112
01:11:19,538 --> 01:11:22,859
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a character you pick who dances, and they're overdeveloped in the head.

1113
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:27,902
[SPEAKER_09]: And they sing, and at the bottom is like...

1114
01:11:28,942 --> 01:11:33,945
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, if anybody's ever seen karaoke, words go by, or usually words are there and then they light up.

1115
01:11:34,545 --> 01:11:36,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the words, like this whole screen full of words.

1116
01:11:36,886 --> 01:11:47,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, except with this, at the very bottom, there's like a rectangular section, takes up probably a third of the screen or a quarter of the screen at the bottom, that has the words that go from right to left.

1117
01:11:47,932 --> 01:11:49,193
[SPEAKER_09]: They scroll across the screen.

1118
01:11:50,730 --> 01:11:52,533
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like watching the news on CNN.

1119
01:11:52,613 --> 01:11:53,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly, like a ticker.

1120
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:59,646
[SPEAKER_09]: And on the left is a line similar to any Beatmania or DDR.

1121
01:11:59,666 --> 01:12:02,010
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a judgment line where you have to start here.

1122
01:12:03,232 --> 01:12:08,456
[SPEAKER_09]: And then from the top to the bottom where the words are, are lines of how long you're supposed to hold a note.

1123
01:12:08,797 --> 01:12:14,622
[SPEAKER_09]: And they go up and down depending on if the note should be high or low or whatnot.

1124
01:12:14,722 --> 01:12:19,667
[SPEAKER_09]: And if some of the notes, and I'm not going to sing, but they'll go like, mmm, they'll rise.

1125
01:12:20,868 --> 01:12:23,390
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll see the little line go up or down.

1126
01:12:23,470 --> 01:12:25,052
[SPEAKER_09]: So you kind of have to follow the...

1127
01:12:26,753 --> 01:12:29,196
[SPEAKER_09]: The tone of it, you know, it just judges on the tone of it.

1128
01:12:29,276 --> 01:12:35,583
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can pretty much make up any word you want or go, la la la la, or like I did for It's the End of the World.

1129
01:12:35,643 --> 01:12:40,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of doing the rap thing that he does, I go, da da da da da da da da da da da da da.

1130
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:42,730
[SPEAKER_09]: and so on.

1131
01:13:04,215 --> 01:13:08,257
[SPEAKER_08]: I never thought I would hear you sing, but this game finally got it.

1132
01:13:28,406 --> 01:13:33,313
[SPEAKER_09]: If that's on and that person is singing really high, you can drop your octave and it's still great.

1133
01:13:34,054 --> 01:13:37,738
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got a pretty sophisticated tone recognition system in it.

1134
01:13:37,779 --> 01:13:38,339
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really good.

1135
01:13:40,051 --> 01:13:41,552
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a virgin Like a virgin is sung

1136
01:13:59,443 --> 01:14:00,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

1137
01:14:19,881 --> 01:14:21,641
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to agree, this is a great game.

1138
01:14:21,681 --> 01:14:26,062
[SPEAKER_08]: I was really skeptical about it at first, but it's fucking great.

1139
01:14:26,142 --> 01:14:27,062
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great idea.

1140
01:14:27,642 --> 01:14:31,023
[SPEAKER_08]: My only kind of... I have a couple concerns with it, though.

1141
01:14:31,163 --> 01:14:37,744
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's a great game, great party game, but as a solo game, it's not something I could see myself kind of motivating myself to do solo.

1142
01:14:37,844 --> 01:14:45,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, it will... Whereas DDR will not make you a better dancer, Karaoke Revolution will make you a better singer.

1143
01:14:45,166 --> 01:14:45,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

1144
01:14:45,626 --> 01:14:46,206
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know yet.

1145
01:14:46,266 --> 01:14:46,546
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're...

1146
01:14:47,743 --> 01:14:48,264
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll help.

1147
01:14:48,904 --> 01:14:54,609
[SPEAKER_08]: It helps show you if you're on key or not, A. B, it helps you to kind of hold your pitch and maintain your pitch.

1148
01:14:54,909 --> 01:14:56,070
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the biggest thing about it.

1149
01:14:56,611 --> 01:15:01,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Really, the way you get better at singing is by singing more and more.

1150
01:15:01,735 --> 01:15:04,837
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Karaoke Revolution will help you be a better singer.

1151
01:15:05,278 --> 01:15:10,262
[SPEAKER_08]: It won't turn you into an all-star, but it'll help you go from, you know, not so great, but to decent.

1152
01:15:10,482 --> 01:15:16,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, see, on the songs that it's got on there, it'll point out to you that, hey, you're not supposed to, you know, sing the song this certain way.

1153
01:15:16,905 --> 01:15:19,266
[SPEAKER_09]: It actually shows you the way the song's supposed to be sung.

1154
01:15:19,706 --> 01:15:28,109
[SPEAKER_09]: For most parts, I noticed that in some of the songs, it looks like they programmed the lines in, the grading in, like, maybe a little different than the original singer sang it.

1155
01:15:28,449 --> 01:15:29,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I got kind of confused on some of the songs.

1156
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:37,253
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, wait a minute, the line is going up, or it stays straight when the singer's, like, actually raising their pitch or lowering it and whatnot, so...

1157
01:15:37,893 --> 01:15:54,767
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, but altogether, the biggest thing I don't like about it is that it's coded, the lines that go by, you know, that you're supposed to sing it, are coded in only one way, so you can only sing the song in one way as far as, you know, your tone.

1158
01:15:54,807 --> 01:15:58,671
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't improvise, you can improvise words, but you can't improvise...

1159
01:15:59,111 --> 01:16:00,392
[SPEAKER_21]: Unless you play non-judge mode.

1160
01:16:00,412 --> 01:16:02,093
[SPEAKER_21]: There is a free mode that you're not judged.

1161
01:16:02,273 --> 01:16:04,834
[SPEAKER_09]: And you say you're not judged, so it's almost like not even really worth playing it.

1162
01:16:04,854 --> 01:16:06,735
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, might as well just sing along to any song.

1163
01:16:06,775 --> 01:16:07,055
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

1164
01:16:08,376 --> 01:16:13,579
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish that they had kind of like an edit mode where you can edit the lines in any way you wanted to.

1165
01:16:14,099 --> 01:16:18,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, say you sing it without lines, and it would record those lines as you're singing it.

1166
01:16:18,401 --> 01:16:19,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Like an edit mode?

1167
01:16:19,142 --> 01:16:20,282
[SPEAKER_00]: Like an edit mode for steps.

1168
01:16:20,322 --> 01:16:21,083
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's kind of weird.

1169
01:16:21,143 --> 01:16:21,443
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1170
01:16:22,103 --> 01:16:25,827
[SPEAKER_09]: A real time edit where you're singing and it records the lines so you can play them back later.

1171
01:16:25,867 --> 01:16:27,349
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can improvise a song.

1172
01:16:27,549 --> 01:16:30,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you know a lot of people who go up and do karaoke, they'll improvise a song.

1173
01:16:30,792 --> 01:16:31,713
[SPEAKER_09]: I do, yeah.

1174
01:16:31,873 --> 01:16:35,577
[SPEAKER_09]: To kind of play it up a little more and get people a little more excited.

1175
01:16:36,274 --> 01:16:36,534
[SPEAKER_09]: and many more.

1176
01:16:58,635 --> 01:17:07,485
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's an advertisement for the Matrix though, because most of the people in the crowd are all like agents.

1177
01:17:07,525 --> 01:17:09,728
[SPEAKER_09]: They all look exactly the same, wearing the same things.

1178
01:17:09,748 --> 01:17:09,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1179
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:13,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Or the best, when you suck, they start walking away.

1180
01:17:13,693 --> 01:17:13,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1181
01:17:15,373 --> 01:17:18,937
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if you totally fail the song, your person breaks down and cries on the stage.

1182
01:17:18,957 --> 01:17:19,898
[SPEAKER_08]: They fall to the ground.

1183
01:17:20,539 --> 01:17:21,139
[SPEAKER_08]: It was great.

1184
01:17:21,179 --> 01:17:21,860
[SPEAKER_13]: You hate me.

1185
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:23,061
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't love me.

1186
01:17:23,382 --> 01:17:25,744
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think of the song list?

1187
01:17:25,784 --> 01:17:28,127
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard some complaints, and this is kind of one of my chief complaints.

1188
01:17:28,187 --> 01:17:30,069
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of not enough songs, but...

1189
01:17:31,471 --> 01:17:34,612
[SPEAKER_08]: All things considered, they only license 35 songs or whatever.

1190
01:17:34,672 --> 01:17:36,593
[SPEAKER_08]: There are 35 pretty solid songs.

1191
01:17:36,613 --> 01:17:39,654
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a pretty damn good mix of music in it, I think.

1192
01:17:39,874 --> 01:17:44,115
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's at least one, two songs that everybody's going to dig.

1193
01:17:45,016 --> 01:17:49,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Like when we fired it up and Broken Wings was in it, Loki was like, oh my god, cool.

1194
01:17:49,497 --> 01:17:50,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.

1195
01:17:50,558 --> 01:17:51,258
[SPEAKER_09]: There are some...

1196
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:54,820
[SPEAKER_09]: There are some great classics in this.

1197
01:17:56,181 --> 01:18:03,526
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, some of the best classic 80s music and some of the better pop music, because I'm not a big fan of pop, you know.

1198
01:18:03,987 --> 01:18:06,689
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a mild fan of top 40 pop.

1199
01:18:06,709 --> 01:18:08,890
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of it I don't like, but there's a lot of it I do like.

1200
01:18:08,910 --> 01:18:13,614
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was really happy to see that there were a couple of Michelle Branch songs in there, because I dig her and stuff.

1201
01:18:13,654 --> 01:18:19,258
[SPEAKER_09]: They have some good... Yeah, actually, I think they did a very good job in the song selection, except for...

1202
01:18:20,018 --> 01:18:26,121
[SPEAKER_09]: And I understand the reason why they did this, I think, if it's the same reason I'm thinking, putting in songs like Son of a Preacher or whatever.

1203
01:18:26,741 --> 01:18:27,681
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, or whatever it's called.

1204
01:18:27,701 --> 01:18:36,165
[SPEAKER_08]: You are still mad that you got the Chain of Fools song on random last night.

1205
01:18:36,225 --> 01:18:38,245
[SPEAKER_08]: You are still mad you had to sing that last night.

1206
01:18:38,526 --> 01:18:41,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, they put some really stupid songs in there, but that's just my opinion.

1207
01:18:41,767 --> 01:18:43,628
[SPEAKER_09]: I know there are people out there that love these songs.

1208
01:18:43,708 --> 01:18:44,648
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not classics.

1209
01:18:45,068 --> 01:18:47,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Aretha, come on, Aretha is classic.

1210
01:18:47,529 --> 01:18:49,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I understand the purpose, it's just like...

1211
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:49,990
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1212
01:18:50,010 --> 01:18:51,572
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to sing to the fools.

1213
01:18:51,592 --> 01:18:54,876
[SPEAKER_08]: There's going to be just as many songs that you hate as there are going to be that you love.

1214
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:57,339
[SPEAKER_09]: There's less songs that I hate than there are songs that I like.

1215
01:18:58,220 --> 01:19:01,083
[SPEAKER_08]: And like Bizarre Love Triangle, it was like, oh my god.

1216
01:19:01,183 --> 01:19:04,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, some of the great 80s songs like Bizarre Love Triangle, um...

1217
01:19:05,438 --> 01:19:06,139
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1218
01:19:24,696 --> 01:19:28,120
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope there's some really good stuff on the expansion.

1219
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:28,801
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's anything like...

1220
01:19:41,377 --> 01:19:44,179
[SPEAKER_09]: What they released on the core mix that they just released.

1221
01:19:44,299 --> 01:19:46,641
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we got some good music coming out.

1222
01:19:46,701 --> 01:19:50,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what would be nice is, you know, it really depends, I think, on how this game takes off.

1223
01:19:50,344 --> 01:20:01,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, if it's really popular, if it goes DDR style, then I think we're going to see a lot of... I think we'll see really specialized discs where it's going to be like women hits of the 90s type thing, expansion discs, then male hits of the 90s type thing.

1224
01:20:01,433 --> 01:20:04,475
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all dependent on how they advertise this thing.

1225
01:20:04,515 --> 01:20:08,178
[SPEAKER_09]: And Konami in America has not been known for the best advertising campaigns.

1226
01:20:08,838 --> 01:20:09,099
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's...

1227
01:20:12,331 --> 01:20:13,733
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1228
01:20:25,368 --> 01:20:25,708
[SPEAKER_08]: and so on.

1229
01:20:44,773 --> 01:20:45,894
[SPEAKER_08]: and so on.

1230
01:21:12,233 --> 01:21:36,650
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope that the Japanese versions are worthy of bringing over Oh, not bringing over here, but for me to import Because there's a lot of J-rock and J-pop songs that I really, really like That I would love to get to play in Karaoke Revolution I hope some Larkin Seal stuff shows up In Japan, they are doing Karaoke Revolution in Japan, too And if you go to the official Karaoke Revolution website for Japan...

1231
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:57,822
[SPEAKER_08]: 6 expansion discs already out 6 expansion discs are coming out this month I think later this month 6 discs and we're talking and they kind of do the genre thing a little bit because there's one that's specifically for ballads and there's a couple J-pop hits and things like that and there are groups Morning Musume Ayumi of course Ayumi's on there of course what were some of the other bands um

1232
01:22:00,644 --> 01:22:07,589
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't wait to sing Chocoto Love with Petit Love I don't think Chocoto Love was on there Really?

1233
01:22:07,609 --> 01:22:15,533
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I would have recognized it I may have missed it Or the original Freckles, Suboxone, however you pronounce it Alright, Terry, comment?

1234
01:22:20,201 --> 01:22:21,902
[SPEAKER_04]: My parents have something that's kind of like this.

1235
01:22:21,962 --> 01:22:26,986
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this stand-alone DVD karaoke-based thing that does the same kind of thing.

1236
01:22:27,046 --> 01:22:30,569
[SPEAKER_04]: It measures the tone and the timing that you do.

1237
01:22:31,170 --> 01:22:36,794
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got nine DVDs of Korean, Japanese, Filipino, Chinese, and American music.

1238
01:22:36,974 --> 01:22:37,755
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, my gosh.

1239
01:22:37,975 --> 01:22:39,937
[SPEAKER_04]: And the DVDs are swappable.

1240
01:22:40,417 --> 01:22:41,338
[SPEAKER_04]: This thing was about $400, and it's...

1241
01:22:42,899 --> 01:22:47,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally awesome, because every time we go down there, I mean, we spend the first day just doing this thing.

1242
01:22:47,643 --> 01:22:54,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing gangsters, and it's great because it shows the backgrounds have absolutely nothing to do with the show.

1243
01:22:55,070 --> 01:23:04,397
[SPEAKER_04]: And the song, you know, they had Gangster's Paradise, and the background is showing this peaceful little farm, almost like it should be Amish Paradise, and it's just great.

1244
01:23:05,598 --> 01:23:08,041
[SPEAKER_09]: That reminds me of when we went to, was it CyberZone?

1245
01:23:08,789 --> 01:23:09,409
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

1246
01:23:29,901 --> 01:23:31,042
[SPEAKER_08]: and we had the big fanfare and everything.

1247
01:23:31,062 --> 01:23:33,804
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the thing is, I noticed you guys suck and you still got high grades.

1248
01:23:33,824 --> 01:23:34,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up!

1249
01:23:34,385 --> 01:23:36,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, anyway, well, I mean, I read and stuff.

1250
01:23:36,987 --> 01:23:40,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, you don't even want to know how much time I spent in that stupid karaoke room at the tournament.

1251
01:23:40,589 --> 01:23:41,590
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I was there, man.

1252
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:42,931
[SPEAKER_09]: You were in there all the time with her.

1253
01:23:42,971 --> 01:23:44,032
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, man, we gotta get out of there.

1254
01:23:44,112 --> 01:23:44,593
[SPEAKER_08]: It was so much fun.

1255
01:23:44,793 --> 01:23:46,034
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a blast.

1256
01:23:46,074 --> 01:23:47,815
[SPEAKER_08]: We were laughing our ass off in there.

1257
01:23:48,175 --> 01:23:57,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, the great thing is, like, just like Terry says, like, you'll be singing a song and the background is like this nice landscape of Alaska with this, like, these deers and elk and mooses and shit.

1258
01:23:57,803 --> 01:23:57,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Like,

1259
01:23:58,804 --> 01:24:02,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly, to like a Gangster's Paradise or some weird Britney Spears song.

1260
01:24:02,410 --> 01:24:03,813
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, what the hell?

1261
01:24:03,833 --> 01:24:05,636
[SPEAKER_09]: This video has nothing to do with anything.

1262
01:24:06,963 --> 01:24:08,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's to throw you off, totally.

1263
01:24:09,225 --> 01:24:22,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's the thing though, is that this game, if you've played, I don't know about the one that Terry's talking about, but I would assume it's kind of like the one that we saw at CyberZone, where it grades you, but this thing is like a really, really accurate grading system, this karaoke revolution.

1264
01:24:22,574 --> 01:24:25,777
[SPEAKER_09]: I was so surprised at how much work they put into it.

1265
01:24:26,117 --> 01:24:28,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't they put some more work into DDR, like they did this?

1266
01:24:30,221 --> 01:24:31,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Some other comments in the chat.

1267
01:24:31,243 --> 01:24:33,006
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to address some comments that came up in the chat room.

1268
01:24:33,266 --> 01:24:33,667
[SPEAKER_08]: One comment.

1269
01:24:33,747 --> 01:24:36,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you buy Karaoke Revolution for the Japanese PS2?

1270
01:24:37,013 --> 01:24:42,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Not likely to happen unless they release some kind of American songs expansion pack because...

1271
01:24:43,291 --> 01:24:44,691
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't sing in Japanese.

1272
01:24:45,472 --> 01:24:46,812
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not going to just fake it.

1273
01:24:46,892 --> 01:24:48,292
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I don't know any of the songs.

1274
01:24:48,372 --> 01:24:51,793
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't listen to J music as much as Brad does.

1275
01:24:51,853 --> 01:24:56,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe he would like it, but I just wouldn't know the songs well enough to necessitate buying it.

1276
01:24:56,475 --> 01:25:00,996
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is one of those rare cases where the American version has something for me and the Japanese doesn't.

1277
01:25:01,116 --> 01:25:09,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's just for those people like, I don't know, like me, I don't understand Japanese, but from listening to a lot of Japanese music and like...

1278
01:25:11,099 --> 01:25:12,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Ayuma Hamasaki, Larkin Seal

1279
01:25:14,934 --> 01:25:18,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Tons of just Japanese pop and rock artists and stuff.

1280
01:25:19,417 --> 01:25:21,959
[SPEAKER_09]: I can pick up a lot of these words and I start to know the lyrics.

1281
01:25:22,019 --> 01:25:26,182
[SPEAKER_09]: And I can actually look at the lyrics and I can sing the lyrics in Japanese.

1282
01:25:26,242 --> 01:25:27,523
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no fucking idea what they're talking about.

1283
01:25:27,543 --> 01:25:31,406
[SPEAKER_09]: They could be saying, you stupid hunky bitches from America, stop buying our shit.

1284
01:25:31,627 --> 01:25:33,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Or, you know, doing this stuff.

1285
01:25:33,388 --> 01:25:40,533
[SPEAKER_09]: But for me, or for anybody like me who's that into it, yeah, you could go ahead and import the Japanese versions.

1286
01:25:40,634 --> 01:25:41,094
[SPEAKER_09]: I might.

1287
01:25:41,654 --> 01:25:41,914
[SPEAKER_09]: and so on.

1288
01:26:06,521 --> 01:26:13,904
[SPEAKER_08]: I have seen, because they do let you bring in your own music, and I saw somebody once, they brought in, it was some kind of, like it was an Indian song.

1289
01:26:15,144 --> 01:26:19,126
[SPEAKER_08]: One of those, it sounded like it was straight out of a Bollywood picture type thing.

1290
01:26:19,426 --> 01:26:21,107
[SPEAKER_08]: And he was doing the dance and everything.

1291
01:26:21,127 --> 01:26:21,847
[SPEAKER_08]: It was great.

1292
01:26:22,087 --> 01:26:23,468
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I was entertained by it.

1293
01:26:23,508 --> 01:26:25,509
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know what the hell he was saying, but it was totally entertaining.

1294
01:26:25,789 --> 01:26:28,450
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, you get your freaks in there every once in a while.

1295
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:29,891
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't say he was a freak.

1296
01:26:29,951 --> 01:26:30,171
[SPEAKER_09]: He was...

1297
01:26:31,314 --> 01:26:34,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Keyboard, something interesting, confusing language.

1298
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:35,456
[SPEAKER_09]: You're an ass.

1299
01:26:35,797 --> 01:26:36,397
[SPEAKER_15]: You're an ass.

1300
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously.

1301
01:26:44,101 --> 01:26:45,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, what were some other...

1302
01:26:49,027 --> 01:27:15,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Mel B has a cameo in Karaoke Revolution and it's actually in a video that you unlock we haven't gotten it ourselves yet but apparently you can unlock the song one week when you beat solo mode and you get a video with it too in the video section and apparently Mel B is in there singing a little bit of one week it's a clip of all these people singing one week and apparently he's in it

1303
01:27:16,323 --> 01:27:18,904
[SPEAKER_08]: So, of course, you know we're going to unlock that shit this week.

1304
01:27:18,924 --> 01:27:19,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Do it now.

1305
01:27:19,564 --> 01:27:21,704
[SPEAKER_08]: And we will play it on the show for you next week.

1306
01:27:21,784 --> 01:27:23,485
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe we can get Loki to remix it.

1307
01:27:24,725 --> 01:27:25,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, guys.

1308
01:27:25,385 --> 01:27:26,905
[SPEAKER_09]: We're cutting off the show now.

1309
01:27:26,945 --> 01:27:28,486
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to go unlock Mel B's video.

1310
01:27:28,566 --> 01:27:34,407
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I... Well, I kind of just... I want to wait until the next time he's actually here on the show, which might not be... Hopefully in the next couple weeks.

1311
01:27:34,427 --> 01:27:35,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we'll unlock it now.

1312
01:27:36,148 --> 01:27:41,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm... Well, you know, I'm going to unlock it now so I can see it, but I want to get him here and then play it over and over and say, Hey, Mel!

1313
01:27:43,669 --> 01:27:45,810
[SPEAKER_08]: and play the sound and then embarrass the shit out of them.

1314
01:27:45,830 --> 01:27:47,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there going to be a beatbox to it or something?

1315
01:27:47,931 --> 01:27:48,371
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1316
01:27:48,551 --> 01:27:49,531
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what it is yet.

1317
01:27:49,591 --> 01:27:50,291
[SPEAKER_08]: We will see soon.

1318
01:27:50,591 --> 01:27:57,793
[SPEAKER_08]: But I hear it's really cute that they even have a dog wearing the headset at one point that barks.

1319
01:27:58,214 --> 01:28:02,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is what the original song kind of sounds like to me.

1320
01:28:03,675 --> 01:28:05,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other thoughts on Karaoke Revolution?

1321
01:28:07,176 --> 01:28:09,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank God they don't have that stupid song All Star in there.

1322
01:28:11,186 --> 01:28:12,127
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I gotta say.

1323
01:28:12,267 --> 01:28:13,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, now, you're an all-star.

1324
01:28:13,768 --> 01:28:14,148
[SPEAKER_08]: That one?

1325
01:28:14,749 --> 01:28:15,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1326
01:28:15,109 --> 01:28:17,031
[SPEAKER_08]: Why such a hatred on that specific song?

1327
01:28:17,211 --> 01:28:23,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they use it in, like, every single fucking movie trailer and shit for, like, all these lame-ass movies.

1328
01:28:23,375 --> 01:28:25,577
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you have Mystery Man and Shrek.

1329
01:28:26,778 --> 01:28:29,400
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the movie, too, but the trailer song was lame.

1330
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:29,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Garbage.

1331
01:28:29,961 --> 01:28:36,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and Shrek 2, which I just saw before Elf, it also had that...

1332
01:28:37,136 --> 01:28:38,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Shrek 2.

1333
01:28:38,537 --> 01:28:40,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Also had the goddamn song on it, too.

1334
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:43,041
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, ugh.

1335
01:28:45,364 --> 01:28:45,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Loki.

1336
01:28:45,844 --> 01:28:46,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Shrek 2?

1337
01:28:46,665 --> 01:28:46,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?

1338
01:28:46,965 --> 01:28:47,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, now.

1339
01:28:47,505 --> 01:28:48,266
[SPEAKER_09]: You're an all-star.

1340
01:28:48,446 --> 01:28:50,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Get your... I'm gonna punch you.

1341
01:28:50,408 --> 01:28:52,930
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't like that song, either.

1342
01:28:52,990 --> 01:28:53,831
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't... What is that?

1343
01:28:53,891 --> 01:28:54,432
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate it, too.

1344
01:28:54,452 --> 01:28:55,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that Smash Mouth?

1345
01:28:56,814 --> 01:28:57,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck Smash Mouth.

1346
01:28:58,453 --> 01:28:58,833
[SPEAKER_09]: No thanks.

1347
01:28:59,414 --> 01:29:02,616
[SPEAKER_09]: They're doing all these commercials now because they can't make any more music.

1348
01:29:02,676 --> 01:29:05,698
[SPEAKER_09]: They're constantly doing educational commercials and shit.

1349
01:29:05,718 --> 01:29:06,319
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so stupid.

1350
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:10,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Any more thoughts on Karaoke Revolution, Brad?

1351
01:29:11,522 --> 01:29:12,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Being one of the only other ones that's played it.

1352
01:29:12,823 --> 01:29:14,945
[SPEAKER_08]: The other ones, I can tell we're boring everyone else here.

1353
01:29:14,965 --> 01:29:16,606
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like, eh, haven't played it.

1354
01:29:16,666 --> 01:29:17,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Go out and buy it.

1355
01:29:18,247 --> 01:29:19,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Please, everybody.

1356
01:29:19,968 --> 01:29:24,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we want Konami to get more money off of this so that they can go ahead and make more stuff like this in America.

1357
01:29:24,791 --> 01:29:25,212
[SPEAKER_13]: Mm-hmm.

1358
01:29:26,365 --> 01:29:34,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Then again, maybe if we tell them to not buy it and it does bad, maybe they'll put more of their time and money into games like Castlevania instead of... And DDR.

1359
01:29:35,011 --> 01:29:38,393
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I could give a fuck about DDR as long as I'm getting my Castlevania on.

1360
01:29:39,574 --> 01:29:39,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1361
01:29:40,835 --> 01:29:43,637
[SPEAKER_08]: I think now we're going to get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

1362
01:29:43,677 --> 01:29:44,858
[SPEAKER_08]: How does that sound to you guys?

1363
01:29:44,978 --> 01:29:45,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you ready to rock?

1364
01:29:45,878 --> 01:29:48,740
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's get ready to rock!

1365
01:29:50,268 --> 01:29:56,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, last week in the Orange Lounge Cage match, Jamie's song won, which is good news for her, because she didn't have to pick something while she's on vacation.

1366
01:29:57,018 --> 01:30:02,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though she's not here, though, her song still gets to go for its third win in a row if it wins tonight.

1367
01:30:02,607 --> 01:30:05,671
[SPEAKER_08]: And it wouldn't be any surprise, because it's a pretty darn good song.

1368
01:30:06,736 --> 01:30:11,978
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a group called CyberX, and it features somebody named Rupina, and it's called Little Flower.

1369
01:30:12,478 --> 01:30:21,080
[SPEAKER_08]: The way the cage match works is that we're going to play three songs for you guys, and you vote for your favorite, and that song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music and More program.

1370
01:30:22,181 --> 01:30:29,063
[SPEAKER_08]: But you have to be in our chat room to play along, so head over to www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on chat.

1371
01:30:29,543 --> 01:30:31,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Whole shitload of people in our chat room tonight.

1372
01:30:31,404 --> 01:30:33,744
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more crowded than I've seen it in a while.

1373
01:30:34,064 --> 01:30:34,905
[SPEAKER_08]: A whole shitload.

1374
01:30:34,925 --> 01:30:35,665
[SPEAKER_08]: More than a buttload.

1375
01:30:35,905 --> 01:30:37,606
[SPEAKER_08]: That's more than a buttload, it's a shitload.

1376
01:30:38,426 --> 01:30:39,626
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um... Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1377
01:30:40,566 --> 01:30:40,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on.

1378
01:30:41,127 --> 01:30:42,767
[SPEAKER_08]: I vote for Holly.

1379
01:30:42,787 --> 01:30:43,907
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you can't vote for Holly.

1380
01:30:44,188 --> 01:30:44,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, here we go.

1381
01:30:44,788 --> 01:30:45,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's a clip.

1382
01:30:45,988 --> 01:30:48,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it won last week, you only get a clip of it.

1383
01:30:48,529 --> 01:30:51,350
[SPEAKER_08]: It's CyberX featuring Rupino with Little Flower.

1384
01:30:51,510 --> 01:30:51,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy.

1385
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:55,371
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the first song you can vote for tonight.

1386
01:31:20,706 --> 01:31:21,927
Thank you for watching!

1387
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:52,312
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching.

1388
01:32:52,332 --> 01:32:53,354
[SPEAKER_13]: See you next time.

1389
01:34:05,538 --> 01:34:07,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that was about half of last week's winner.

1390
01:34:07,921 --> 01:34:10,024
[SPEAKER_08]: CyberX featuring Rapinoe with Little Flower.

1391
01:34:10,064 --> 01:34:11,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Two weeks in a row winning.

1392
01:34:11,325 --> 01:34:12,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Will it win tonight again?

1393
01:34:13,688 --> 01:34:14,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody says no.

1394
01:34:14,730 --> 01:34:15,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Gosh, you guys are mean.

1395
01:34:16,472 --> 01:34:19,216
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's been winning twice or whatever, then it should be ticked off.

1396
01:34:19,316 --> 01:34:21,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you're not allowed to give your opinion.

1397
01:34:21,538 --> 01:34:22,920
[SPEAKER_08]: You had to give your opinion two weeks ago.

1398
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:23,301
[SPEAKER_09]: No, this is back.

1399
01:34:24,515 --> 01:34:24,895
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1400
01:34:25,075 --> 01:34:27,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Will it be my pick that knocks it off tonight?

1401
01:34:28,037 --> 01:34:30,499
[SPEAKER_08]: My pick, probably not, but we can try it anyway.

1402
01:34:30,919 --> 01:34:33,981
[SPEAKER_08]: My pick is, they're actually a Bomani artist now.

1403
01:34:34,242 --> 01:34:37,784
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a song in DDR Max, USA.

1404
01:34:38,585 --> 01:34:39,485
[SPEAKER_08]: You remember the song.

1405
01:34:39,685 --> 01:34:40,166
[SPEAKER_08]: It was huge.

1406
01:34:40,186 --> 01:34:40,806
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of you liked it.

1407
01:34:40,846 --> 01:34:41,647
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Sandstorm.

1408
01:34:42,788 --> 01:34:45,810
[SPEAKER_08]: And Darude has a new song out now that is my pick for tonight's cave match.

1409
01:34:45,850 --> 01:34:46,671
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called Music.

1410
01:34:47,091 --> 01:34:52,495
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not like, hey, Mr. DJ kind of music, but it's... Or I got a music, don't stop...

1411
01:34:54,239 --> 01:34:56,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think there's, there isn't, Darude's not in Ultramix.

1412
01:34:59,545 --> 01:34:59,786
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1413
01:35:00,627 --> 01:35:01,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, whatever.

1414
01:35:02,249 --> 01:35:03,830
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care if it's going to be in DDR in the future.

1415
01:35:06,213 --> 01:35:07,755
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it would be good for DDR, though.

1416
01:35:07,775 --> 01:35:10,298
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, here's my pick for tonight's cage match.

1417
01:35:10,338 --> 01:35:12,020
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Darude with music.

1418
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:12,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy.

1419
01:35:34,975 --> 01:35:35,735
Thanks for watching!

1420
01:36:45,546 --> 01:36:48,814
I've got superpowers, don't you think?

1421
01:37:20,483 --> 01:37:21,164
Thanks for watching!

1422
01:38:44,384 --> 01:38:47,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that was song number two in tonight's KH match.

1423
01:38:47,606 --> 01:38:49,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Garud with music.

1424
01:38:49,187 --> 01:38:50,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go around and see what folks thought of that.

1425
01:38:50,688 --> 01:38:51,649
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll start with Brad.

1426
01:38:58,933 --> 01:38:59,414
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty good.

1427
01:39:00,474 --> 01:39:05,958
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think I'm a huge fan of Garud because they're kind of cookie cutter trance for me.

1428
01:39:06,653 --> 01:39:07,613
[SPEAKER_09]: So, but it's still good.

1429
01:39:07,713 --> 01:39:11,835
[SPEAKER_09]: I would have to vote for that if I can only vote for the last song or this song.

1430
01:39:12,895 --> 01:39:13,156
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

1431
01:39:14,696 --> 01:39:15,536
[SPEAKER_09]: And scale 1 to 10?

1432
01:39:16,077 --> 01:39:16,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Scale 1 to 10?

1433
01:39:17,297 --> 01:39:17,717
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll give it a 7.

1434
01:39:17,817 --> 01:39:18,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1435
01:39:19,158 --> 01:39:19,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Will!

1436
01:39:22,139 --> 01:39:22,799
[SPEAKER_06]: It's alright.

1437
01:39:23,179 --> 01:39:27,201
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounded kind of rude-ish.

1438
01:39:27,721 --> 01:39:34,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty, yeah, like Brad said, kind of... Didn't you send this to me a long time ago?

1439
01:39:34,404 --> 01:39:34,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I did.

1440
01:39:35,819 --> 01:39:36,759
[SPEAKER_06]: You must be sick of it now.

1441
01:39:36,819 --> 01:39:39,180
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not bad, though.

1442
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:40,920
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say it's a seven.

1443
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:41,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1444
01:39:43,061 --> 01:39:43,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki!

1445
01:39:45,441 --> 01:39:49,582
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like the same four bars or something, just repeated throughout the whole song.

1446
01:39:49,942 --> 01:39:55,644
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I've heard very repetitive trance before, but I mean, that's pretty bad.

1447
01:39:56,044 --> 01:39:59,065
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, even Sandstorm wasn't as repetitive as that.

1448
01:39:59,105 --> 01:40:00,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I disagree with that.

1449
01:40:02,213 --> 01:40:02,653
[SPEAKER_09]: But okay.

1450
01:40:02,673 --> 01:40:05,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Strangely enough, I like Sandstorm better than that song.

1451
01:40:05,455 --> 01:40:07,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe it's just because it's got good memories for me.

1452
01:40:07,536 --> 01:40:12,998
[SPEAKER_09]: When we had a very good radio station in the Sacramento area that got taken up by crazy freaking Christian people.

1453
01:40:13,418 --> 01:40:14,359
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, is your name Loki?

1454
01:40:15,279 --> 01:40:16,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1455
01:40:17,540 --> 01:40:25,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I remember when we used to do, like, the secret word of the day and stuff, and we used to, like, be falling down laughing because we'd be making fun of ravers.

1456
01:40:25,644 --> 01:40:27,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I remember when Orange Lounge Radio was funny.

1457
01:40:31,457 --> 01:40:33,098
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I give it a six.

1458
01:40:33,578 --> 01:40:33,878
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1459
01:40:34,919 --> 01:40:36,699
[SPEAKER_17]: Terry, Mr. Vandalus.

1460
01:40:38,380 --> 01:40:42,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was very trancy and very repetitive, as trancy songs can be.

1461
01:40:43,963 --> 01:40:45,003
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd give that one a seven.

1462
01:40:45,743 --> 01:40:46,004
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1463
01:40:46,024 --> 01:40:47,104
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely liked it better than the first one.

1464
01:40:48,645 --> 01:40:51,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Bradley, your thoughts on Darude Music?

1465
01:40:52,727 --> 01:40:55,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Pretty much the same as everyone else, kind of thing.

1466
01:40:56,088 --> 01:41:00,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Sort of there and repetitive, but not too bad, so a seven.

1467
01:41:01,218 --> 01:41:09,800
[SPEAKER_08]: I give it an 8, because no song named Music is allowed to be a 10 unless it's Madonna.

1468
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:19,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Now who's Madonna remixed by Oakenfold, because I know they have one of Music.

1469
01:41:20,522 --> 01:41:22,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Oakenfold does some great Madonna mixes.

1470
01:41:22,742 --> 01:41:25,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Oakenfold can take anything and make it good.

1471
01:41:25,819 --> 01:41:28,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Goddammit, I almost picked the Oakenfolds song for tonight's cage match.

1472
01:41:28,621 --> 01:41:29,021
[SPEAKER_08]: I should have.

1473
01:41:29,181 --> 01:41:31,022
[SPEAKER_09]: What if he did a remix of Goonies Are Good Enough?

1474
01:41:31,042 --> 01:41:31,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you like that?

1475
01:41:31,863 --> 01:41:32,603
[SPEAKER_09]: It would probably be good.

1476
01:41:32,623 --> 01:41:32,983
[SPEAKER_08]: I would come.

1477
01:41:33,003 --> 01:41:33,424
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously.

1478
01:41:35,865 --> 01:41:36,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1479
01:41:38,927 --> 01:41:41,008
[SPEAKER_08]: TMI, there is no TMI on this show, okay?

1480
01:41:41,428 --> 01:41:42,549
[SPEAKER_08]: We live in TMI, Bill.

1481
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:44,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1482
01:41:46,091 --> 01:41:48,393
[SPEAKER_08]: The third song in tonight's cage match comes to us from Loki.

1483
01:41:49,218 --> 01:41:50,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, want to introduce this shit?

1484
01:41:50,779 --> 01:41:57,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, literally, it comes to us from me because I made it last night, or this morning, however you want to look at it.

1485
01:41:58,486 --> 01:42:11,137
[SPEAKER_08]: This was per request from the chatroom, they wanted me to remix this song from Kill Bill, which is Battle Without Honor or Cause or something like that, I can't remember the name.

1486
01:42:11,177 --> 01:42:12,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Battle Without a Honor or Humanity.

1487
01:42:13,895 --> 01:42:17,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Battle Without Honor or Humanity The 88 Severed Limbs Mix

1488
01:45:27,492 --> 01:45:30,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, there it is, a brand new Loki remix for you guys.

1489
01:45:30,273 --> 01:45:32,914
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, one of two remixes he's going to debut tonight.

1490
01:45:33,175 --> 01:45:38,777
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's actually another remix coming later, but Loki thinks this one's a little better, so he's going to put this one in tonight's cage match.

1491
01:45:38,817 --> 01:45:42,018
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Battle Without Honor or Humanity, 88 Severed Limbs mix.

1492
01:45:43,439 --> 01:45:44,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, Brad, your thoughts?

1493
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:47,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Fucking spectacular.

1494
01:45:48,281 --> 01:45:51,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, dude, that was awesome, that's all I have to say.

1495
01:45:51,262 --> 01:45:53,463
[SPEAKER_09]: That is getting 5,000 out of 10.

1496
01:45:57,247 --> 01:45:57,827
[SPEAKER_09]: So there you go.

1497
01:45:58,128 --> 01:45:59,068
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm stroking as you go.

1498
01:46:00,309 --> 01:46:01,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like you're stroking your dick there, too.

1499
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:02,770
[SPEAKER_09]: That song made you so happy.

1500
01:46:02,970 --> 01:46:07,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I got some sticky stuff on my fingers from licking something.

1501
01:46:08,914 --> 01:46:09,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Will, your thoughts?

1502
01:46:11,836 --> 01:46:12,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty cool.

1503
01:46:12,676 --> 01:46:16,319
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the rap part thing that went with it.

1504
01:46:17,459 --> 01:46:18,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good to me.

1505
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:19,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Ten.

1506
01:46:19,861 --> 01:46:21,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, ten from Will as well.

1507
01:46:21,462 --> 01:46:21,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki?

1508
01:46:24,584 --> 01:46:25,104
[SPEAKER_08]: I give it a ten.

1509
01:46:26,607 --> 01:46:28,088
[SPEAKER_08]: G, Stroke Your Own Ego Much?

1510
01:46:28,188 --> 01:46:28,709
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just kidding.

1511
01:46:28,909 --> 01:46:29,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Terry.

1512
01:46:30,671 --> 01:46:34,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that song pretty much owned the rest of the song, so I'd give that one.

1513
01:46:36,336 --> 01:46:38,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I like 23 Maguses.

1514
01:46:38,398 --> 01:46:38,758
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd give it an 88.

1515
01:46:38,818 --> 01:46:41,561
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1516
01:46:42,421 --> 01:46:42,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Bradley.

1517
01:46:44,303 --> 01:46:44,703
[SPEAKER_10]: I liked it.

1518
01:46:44,723 --> 01:46:45,324
[SPEAKER_10]: It was good.

1519
01:46:45,344 --> 01:46:52,470
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, not that as really blown away, but it was good.

1520
01:46:52,490 --> 01:46:52,871
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd give it a 9.

1521
01:46:54,560 --> 01:46:56,742
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, I feel weird today, so...

1522
01:47:13,922 --> 01:47:14,943
[SPEAKER_08]: BPM for my songs

1523
01:47:34,882 --> 01:47:36,483
[SPEAKER_08]: So when I'm mixing, it's accurate.

1524
01:47:37,143 --> 01:47:45,306
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I just happened to play Battle Without a Cause, so I went ahead and threw that in there in the acid, and it happened just to fit with the first song I had there.

1525
01:47:45,686 --> 01:47:52,048
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, the guitar and the main synth to it, you can't even hear it because they're blended together so well.

1526
01:47:52,108 --> 01:47:52,948
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was like, oh, okay.

1527
01:47:53,668 --> 01:48:00,691
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the rap part, I just like that from the, you know, that was my favorite part in that one song anyway, so I just threw that in there also, and it turned out well.

1528
01:48:02,958 --> 01:48:03,338
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1529
01:48:03,879 --> 01:48:04,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking fabulous.

1530
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:05,160
[SPEAKER_08]: What can I say?

1531
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:05,721
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1532
01:48:05,841 --> 01:48:06,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's review.

1533
01:48:06,822 --> 01:48:07,442
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what?

1534
01:48:07,542 --> 01:48:11,266
[SPEAKER_08]: As much as we might like that song, it's really up to you guys in the chat room.

1535
01:48:11,306 --> 01:48:12,327
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys have the vote.

1536
01:48:12,407 --> 01:48:13,348
[SPEAKER_08]: So here it is.

1537
01:48:13,368 --> 01:48:15,350
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.

1538
01:48:15,770 --> 01:48:19,033
[SPEAKER_08]: You send your votes over private message to Sky in the chat room.

1539
01:48:19,093 --> 01:48:19,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

1540
01:48:19,674 --> 01:48:21,175
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm there in the chat room waiting for your vote.

1541
01:48:21,556 --> 01:48:22,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Song number one you can vote for tonight.

1542
01:48:23,057 --> 01:48:23,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Last week's winner.

1543
01:48:23,878 --> 01:48:24,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Two weeks in a row now.

1544
01:48:24,839 --> 01:48:27,061
[SPEAKER_08]: CyberX featuring Grupino with Little Flower.

1545
01:48:36,570 --> 01:48:40,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, song number two that you can vote for tonight is Darude with Music.

1546
01:48:51,265 --> 01:48:57,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, and song number three that you can vote for tonight is Battle Without a Honor or Humanity, the 88 Severed Limbs mix.

1547
01:48:57,151 --> 01:48:58,392
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the newest remix from Loki.

1548
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:12,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, there they are.

1549
01:49:12,901 --> 01:49:13,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Send your votes now.

1550
01:49:13,982 --> 01:49:15,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Place vote now!

1551
01:49:16,865 --> 01:49:20,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Send those over private message to Sky.

1552
01:49:21,229 --> 01:49:25,893
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking at the directory of Loki remixes and it looks like he's got about 12 of them now.

1553
01:49:25,933 --> 01:49:26,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Almost enough for a CD.

1554
01:49:27,154 --> 01:49:27,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Almost.

1555
01:49:30,517 --> 01:49:30,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Something.

1556
01:49:31,257 --> 01:49:31,778
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's alright.

1557
01:49:32,278 --> 01:49:34,500
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, actually, why don't we play that other Loki mix?

1558
01:49:34,540 --> 01:49:37,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to talk about your other remix that you did this week, Loki, that you want to debut tonight?

1559
01:49:38,942 --> 01:49:50,691
[SPEAKER_02]: I did this one this morning because actually it was something that Angel is working on right now and so I give her credit for the name and DarkTexi also came up with the name and IDA last night.

1560
01:49:51,051 --> 01:49:57,455
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just threw one together to see how it would end up because they were working on it and so I was like okay well I'll work on my version of it.

1561
01:49:57,836 --> 01:50:00,738
[SPEAKER_08]: This is QQQ and Quasar.

1562
01:50:01,238 --> 01:50:06,822
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't really go together, but, you know, I just figured, you know, for the hell of it, just to try it and see if it worked.

1563
01:50:06,942 --> 01:50:11,485
[SPEAKER_08]: And what else is QQ... QQQQuasar, I guess.

1564
01:50:11,926 --> 01:50:12,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

1565
01:50:12,726 --> 01:50:13,627
[SPEAKER_08]: QQQuasar.

1566
01:50:13,667 --> 01:50:18,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so this is kind of something you... an idea you ruthlessly stole from Angel, basically.

1567
01:50:19,231 --> 01:50:21,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, actually, just from the chatroom in general.

1568
01:50:21,733 --> 01:50:25,635
[SPEAKER_08]: I just did it for the hell of it, just to see, you know, what it was.

1569
01:50:25,675 --> 01:50:26,276
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, whatever.

1570
01:50:27,591 --> 01:50:29,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's check this out.

1571
01:50:29,674 --> 01:50:31,958
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the other new Loki remix we have to debut tonight.

1572
01:50:32,018 --> 01:50:35,162
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Loki vs. Tack with QQ Quasar.

1573
01:52:15,885 --> 01:52:17,686
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, that's the other Loki song we want to debut tonight.

1574
01:52:17,746 --> 01:52:23,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki vs. Tack with QQ Quasar, an idea that was ruthlessly stolen from our chat room, but you did a nice job with it.

1575
01:52:23,968 --> 01:52:24,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Very nice.

1576
01:52:24,569 --> 01:52:29,831
[SPEAKER_08]: As some folks are saying, well, Brad, tell listeners what you've been saying while that song's playing.

1577
01:52:31,517 --> 01:52:32,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, well, I like it.

1578
01:52:32,458 --> 01:52:33,538
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's cool.

1579
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:35,300
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds interesting, but I don't know.

1580
01:52:35,360 --> 01:52:39,383
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think Quasar will really fit with any other song.

1581
01:52:39,403 --> 01:52:44,966
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the way it was written and flows and everything, it kind of just, it's a solo, singular song.

1582
01:52:45,006 --> 01:52:46,928
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't seem to want to mix with anything, it seems like.

1583
01:52:47,608 --> 01:52:48,769
[SPEAKER_09]: But it still sounds interesting.

1584
01:52:48,869 --> 01:52:49,650
[SPEAKER_09]: I kind of like it.

1585
01:52:50,490 --> 01:52:53,512
[SPEAKER_09]: I think QQQ would have a lot more potential with some other song.

1586
01:52:53,552 --> 01:52:58,516
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't think right off the bat what it would mix better with, but still a good effort.

1587
01:52:58,536 --> 01:52:58,936
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it.

1588
01:53:00,204 --> 01:53:01,645
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not electrical parade music.

1589
01:53:01,825 --> 01:53:02,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I don't know.

1590
01:53:02,725 --> 01:53:05,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe you could make it sound good, but we'll see.

1591
01:53:06,587 --> 01:53:10,548
[SPEAKER_02]: There was some song on, because we had this soundtrack for the Disneyland Park.

1592
01:53:10,588 --> 01:53:13,689
[SPEAKER_08]: It was all the music from the rides before they had Splash Mountain.

1593
01:53:13,729 --> 01:53:15,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it was even with Splash Mountain and stuff.

1594
01:53:16,010 --> 01:53:18,011
[SPEAKER_08]: And there was one of the songs in there that was...

1595
01:53:20,305 --> 01:53:20,986
[SPEAKER_08]: God, I can't remember.

1596
01:53:21,006 --> 01:53:27,230
[SPEAKER_08]: It was something from Tomorrowland, and it had a song that sounded just like that, like the quacking type thing.

1597
01:53:27,390 --> 01:53:32,133
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like, it wasn't Electrical Parade, it was something like that, though.

1598
01:53:32,673 --> 01:53:34,014
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember exactly what it is.

1599
01:53:34,834 --> 01:53:37,076
[SPEAKER_08]: But that song would go good with this, because it sounds the same.

1600
01:53:41,459 --> 01:53:41,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1601
01:53:43,033 --> 01:53:44,494
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1602
01:53:45,215 --> 01:53:45,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

1603
01:53:46,656 --> 01:53:50,919
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to give a couple more minutes for the cage match votes to come in.

1604
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:58,984
[SPEAKER_08]: In the meantime, gosh, I'm stretched for topics to talk about tonight.

1605
01:53:59,024 --> 01:54:00,806
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your guys' mind?

1606
01:54:01,086 --> 01:54:02,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything related?

1607
01:54:03,598 --> 01:54:06,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I've been working on my little thing.

1608
01:54:06,181 --> 01:54:08,984
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't get to meet with Keith this week, so that made me mad.

1609
01:54:09,585 --> 01:54:15,292
[SPEAKER_08]: But I've been working on my list for this thing that I'm doing.

1610
01:54:17,714 --> 01:54:24,498
[SPEAKER_08]: It sucks because I was going on DDR Mania X because they have a thread about remaking banners that would work perfectly for what I'm doing.

1611
01:54:25,418 --> 01:54:34,223
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing is, a certain somebody that we used to know that used to be in our chatroom but got banned from our chatroom went ahead and went and fucked up the DDR Mania X forums.

1612
01:54:34,583 --> 01:54:42,067
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you take a look at DDR Mania X's forums, you'll see that a certain somebody that goes by the name Newt decided to take it.

1613
01:54:42,427 --> 01:54:45,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Take a poop on the forums there and fuck them all up.

1614
01:54:46,291 --> 01:54:48,232
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you can thank him for that.

1615
01:54:49,353 --> 01:54:54,798
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, I don't know, other than that, um, nothing much.

1616
01:54:55,139 --> 01:54:56,460
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been playing with the iToy.

1617
01:54:56,700 --> 01:54:59,202
[SPEAKER_08]: That, I guess, is supposed to have a game coming out.

1618
01:54:59,683 --> 01:55:01,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, fuck, the iToy is marvelous.

1619
01:55:01,725 --> 01:55:03,907
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you guys think of iToy, those of you that have seen it?

1620
01:55:04,067 --> 01:55:07,550
[SPEAKER_08]: iToy is just, it's like Angel said, it's like being in Nick Arcade.

1621
01:55:09,284 --> 01:55:17,074
[SPEAKER_09]: All I have to say is I want to... Yeah, do... Okay, anyway, I don't want to embarrass myself anymore.

1622
01:55:17,535 --> 01:55:22,942
[SPEAKER_09]: That little dance game with the little gungoro girl, with the fake and baked tan, is so cute.

1623
01:55:23,062 --> 01:55:23,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god.

1624
01:55:24,304 --> 01:55:26,766
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1625
01:55:44,620 --> 01:55:49,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Licensed Music in it, and it is a game that will watch your motion and somehow judge your dancing ability.

1626
01:55:50,003 --> 01:55:51,224
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how this is going to work yet.

1627
01:55:51,604 --> 01:55:55,706
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen limited screenshots on GameSpot and all that stuff.

1628
01:55:57,307 --> 01:55:57,827
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know.

1629
01:55:57,867 --> 01:56:00,229
[SPEAKER_08]: The iToy is a very interesting piece of technology.

1630
01:56:02,030 --> 01:56:04,231
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's another one of those things that I think kind of loses it.

1631
01:56:05,819 --> 01:56:06,840
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of a party game.

1632
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:08,201
[SPEAKER_08]: I know where it is.

1633
01:56:08,281 --> 01:56:09,523
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll find it later.

1634
01:56:10,303 --> 01:56:14,928
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of one of those things that loses its flair when you're playing it by yourself.

1635
01:56:14,968 --> 01:56:15,849
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more of a party game.

1636
01:56:16,009 --> 01:56:17,711
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be the best thing ever drunk.

1637
01:56:18,131 --> 01:56:24,538
[SPEAKER_08]: I could see myself drunk and playing that sparkles mode where all your motion creates little rainbow sparkles on the screen.

1638
01:56:24,598 --> 01:56:26,119
[SPEAKER_08]: I could see that entertaining myself for hours.

1639
01:56:27,200 --> 01:56:29,902
[SPEAKER_08]: That's so a stoner game too, you know, with the bubbles.

1640
01:56:31,702 --> 01:56:32,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it popped!

1641
01:56:33,543 --> 01:56:34,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Sweet!

1642
01:56:35,764 --> 01:56:36,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Colors!

1643
01:56:37,185 --> 01:56:40,987
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like so... It's just a stoner game.

1644
01:56:41,087 --> 01:56:42,408
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a game for everyone.

1645
01:56:42,948 --> 01:56:47,450
[SPEAKER_08]: You can play this game and no matter what, you know, just find something that you'll enjoy in it.

1646
01:56:47,810 --> 01:56:50,352
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they've got some pretty fun stuff, and they have a mode in there.

1647
01:56:50,832 --> 01:56:54,734
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a game that's just like that, um, Fantavision, where it's with, um...

1648
01:56:56,466 --> 01:56:56,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Fireworks

1649
01:57:12,752 --> 01:57:18,613
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just so funny because you see, like, on the screen, you can see yourself mirrored in, you know, doing what you're doing.

1650
01:57:18,973 --> 01:57:23,755
[SPEAKER_09]: And, like, everybody, like, when they break the boards, they're, like, using their hands like this.

1651
01:57:24,195 --> 01:57:27,575
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't really see it, but they're pointing it straight out like they're doing, like, a paper and rock, paper, scissors.

1652
01:57:27,855 --> 01:57:29,476
[SPEAKER_09]: And they poke it with their fingers.

1653
01:57:29,816 --> 01:57:30,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Poke the board!

1654
01:57:30,816 --> 01:57:32,056
[SPEAKER_09]: And it, like, breaks all.

1655
01:57:32,376 --> 01:57:33,817
[SPEAKER_09]: And they'll hit it with their elbow.

1656
01:57:34,197 --> 01:57:34,797
[SPEAKER_09]: It's good stuff.

1657
01:57:35,457 --> 01:57:42,120
[SPEAKER_08]: The one that was hilarious to me was the Ice Queen was over and he hates spiders more than anything.

1658
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:44,301
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a spider thing on there.

1659
01:57:44,641 --> 01:57:49,904
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's great because what the spiders do is it puts a bunch of spiders on the screen that are attracted to motion.

1660
01:57:50,344 --> 01:57:53,646
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you move a little bit, the spiders will jump on you really quickly.

1661
01:57:53,746 --> 01:57:54,726
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so funny.

1662
01:57:55,006 --> 01:57:57,828
[SPEAKER_08]: They attach themselves to your head and they don't get off.

1663
01:57:57,908 --> 01:58:01,049
[SPEAKER_08]: It made the Ice Queen run out of the room screaming like the faggy is.

1664
01:58:01,129 --> 01:58:01,730
[SPEAKER_08]: It was great.

1665
01:58:01,830 --> 01:58:02,290
[SPEAKER_08]: I loved it.

1666
01:58:03,050 --> 01:58:03,610
[SPEAKER_08]: and so on.

1667
01:58:23,158 --> 01:58:24,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

1668
01:58:24,460 --> 01:58:26,142
[SPEAKER_08]: So, iToy, good thing, bad thing?

1669
01:58:26,422 --> 01:58:27,303
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell is this thing?

1670
01:58:27,463 --> 01:58:32,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it going to go the way of the Super Scope and all these other peripherals that only ever had one game out?

1671
01:58:32,989 --> 01:58:36,593
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no way to know where it's going to go, but I think if we get some...

1672
01:58:38,075 --> 01:58:39,796
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the word I'm looking for?

1673
01:58:39,876 --> 01:58:44,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Imaginative game developers to use this peripheral for something else?

1674
01:58:44,700 --> 01:58:47,782
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's some huge possibilities for this thing.

1675
01:58:47,922 --> 01:58:55,608
[SPEAKER_08]: If anything, you're going to see it used for a bunch of different applications, not necessarily as a full game, but add-on things.

1676
01:58:55,848 --> 01:58:58,349
[SPEAKER_08]: For instance, I'm sure they're going to do this.

1677
01:58:58,610 --> 01:59:03,133
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll be playing a first-person shooter, and you can take a screen cap of your face and post it on your...

1678
01:59:03,493 --> 01:59:04,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1679
01:59:32,939 --> 01:59:34,180
[SPEAKER_09]: All around you.

1680
01:59:35,581 --> 01:59:39,023
[SPEAKER_09]: But it plays, to me, more like Space Channel 5.

1681
01:59:39,743 --> 01:59:43,005
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll do something, and then you have to do... It plays like Parappa to me more.

1682
01:59:43,065 --> 01:59:43,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, okay.

1683
01:59:43,565 --> 01:59:44,646
[SPEAKER_08]: I can see Space Channel 5.

1684
01:59:44,726 --> 01:59:46,027
[SPEAKER_08]: It's exactly like Space Channel 5.

1685
01:59:46,107 --> 01:59:46,907
[SPEAKER_08]: I can see Space Channel 5.

1686
01:59:47,168 --> 01:59:50,349
[SPEAKER_08]: I was thinking more Parappa, but Space Channel 5 is probably a better description for it.

1687
01:59:50,610 --> 01:59:55,693
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's a Beatmania quote-unquote game in there, too, which is the same thing, except it's four speakers in the corner.

1688
01:59:56,053 --> 01:59:57,354
[SPEAKER_08]: And it has a licensed song in it.

1689
01:59:57,394 --> 01:59:59,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it has the... Singing it back...

1690
02:00:00,035 --> 02:00:02,358
[SPEAKER_09]: Swing it back, sing it back to me

1691
02:00:12,918 --> 02:00:16,782
[SPEAKER_08]: I think my favorite game in the whole thing, though, was the Fantavision one, the fireworks one.

1692
02:00:16,802 --> 02:00:17,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that one's fun.

1693
02:00:17,222 --> 02:00:19,144
[SPEAKER_08]: That was cool, because the little detonating things on the side.

1694
02:00:19,164 --> 02:00:19,684
[SPEAKER_08]: That one's really fun.

1695
02:00:19,704 --> 02:00:21,386
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, like, hitting, touching the fireworks, and boom!

1696
02:00:21,586 --> 02:00:22,487
[SPEAKER_08]: And the music's great.

1697
02:00:22,507 --> 02:00:24,769
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hella, like, ravery, heart-knocking.

1698
02:00:24,789 --> 02:00:24,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1699
02:00:25,089 --> 02:00:25,670
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really good.

1700
02:00:26,571 --> 02:00:27,071
[SPEAKER_15]: Good times.

1701
02:00:27,431 --> 02:00:30,855
[SPEAKER_08]: And I love taking the pictures of yourself with little profiles.

1702
02:00:32,256 --> 02:00:35,138
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Xbox should do one of these for Xbox Live.

1703
02:00:35,219 --> 02:00:36,420
[SPEAKER_08]: They would have a ball with this.

1704
02:00:37,714 --> 02:00:41,836
[SPEAKER_08]: And the greatest thing ever is when they do a picture for the high scores.

1705
02:00:41,896 --> 02:00:45,177
[SPEAKER_08]: When you score, you know, top score or whatever, you take a photo.

1706
02:00:45,837 --> 02:00:47,718
[SPEAKER_08]: And their photo gets stuck with the high score.

1707
02:00:48,058 --> 02:00:48,738
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the greatest.

1708
02:00:49,018 --> 02:00:49,539
[SPEAKER_09]: It's funny.

1709
02:00:50,079 --> 02:00:52,560
[SPEAKER_09]: I love how for your profile you get the pictures.

1710
02:00:52,580 --> 02:00:57,802
[SPEAKER_09]: The three pictures, it'll tell you the picture of like a... It says do a happy face, then a sad face, then a silly face.

1711
02:00:58,142 --> 02:01:05,865
[SPEAKER_09]: And so when you go to the profiles to select your character you want to play as, like Matt will have his own and Rob will have his own, it shows their faces changing from like happy, sad...

1712
02:01:06,405 --> 02:01:06,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Silly.

1713
02:01:07,687 --> 02:01:12,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Or then they have some really pointless modes, but they're kind of fun even still, like the window washing.

1714
02:01:12,973 --> 02:01:15,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the window washing with a weird song in the background.

1715
02:01:16,397 --> 02:01:19,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Like this old 40s, when I'm washing windows.

1716
02:01:19,742 --> 02:01:21,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Like this really hella old 40s or 30s song.

1717
02:01:23,722 --> 02:01:24,663
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just perfect though.

1718
02:01:24,803 --> 02:01:25,204
[SPEAKER_08]: It fits.

1719
02:01:25,964 --> 02:01:26,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Good stuff.

1720
02:01:26,845 --> 02:01:27,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1721
02:01:27,505 --> 02:01:27,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Good times.

1722
02:01:28,887 --> 02:01:29,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Very.

1723
02:01:30,028 --> 02:01:43,219
[SPEAKER_08]: But actually, I remember a long time ago, we were reading up on, they were doing, they were developing a Dance Dance Revolution type thing with motion capturing just like this, and I remember looking and going, that's stupid.

1724
02:01:43,739 --> 02:01:44,320
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?

1725
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:48,123
[SPEAKER_08]: If I think, when I see this new dancing game, I think I'll think the exact same thing.

1726
02:01:48,143 --> 02:01:48,924
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll be stupid.

1727
02:01:50,526 --> 02:01:57,379
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, because it's a good concept, but it's not, you know, for like people doing it for like accuracy.

1728
02:01:57,439 --> 02:01:59,524
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, you know, all the PA-ers out there.

1729
02:02:00,717 --> 02:02:01,537
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not going to work.

1730
02:02:01,657 --> 02:02:03,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's not super accurate.

1731
02:02:04,679 --> 02:02:17,863
[SPEAKER_09]: I was getting kind of frustrated because I felt like I was hitting it on time, like rhythm and stuff, but it's just... You've got to be really... Like, there's a game in there where it's a mirror game where you have to hit these... You have to hit the green ones and not the red ones or you get penalized.

1732
02:02:17,883 --> 02:02:18,764
[SPEAKER_09]: They're like these little bubbles.

1733
02:02:19,144 --> 02:02:26,767
[SPEAKER_09]: And what happens is it creates like a mirror effect where one half of the screen changes upside down and whatnot, so you would expect...

1734
02:02:28,097 --> 02:02:31,300
[SPEAKER_09]: When you raise your hand to touch it, it goes in a completely opposite way.

1735
02:02:31,320 --> 02:02:32,000
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard to explain.

1736
02:02:32,020 --> 02:02:32,560
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd have to see it.

1737
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:41,206
[SPEAKER_09]: But the thing is that since you're raising your arm, any part of your arm can touch the sensor area on the screen and you fuck yourself up.

1738
02:02:41,567 --> 02:02:44,389
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's just not a very accurate type of sensor.

1739
02:02:44,409 --> 02:02:49,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Or, depending on the lighting in your room, a shadow could set it off.

1740
02:02:49,272 --> 02:02:49,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.

1741
02:02:51,053 --> 02:02:54,035
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not the most accurate style of whatnot.

1742
02:02:54,095 --> 02:02:55,216
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

1743
02:02:56,137 --> 02:02:56,677
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell?

1744
02:02:58,243 --> 02:02:59,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, they're... Okay, anyway.

1745
02:03:01,184 --> 02:03:05,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I think it's time to announce the winner of the Orange Lounge Cage Match.

1746
02:03:05,345 --> 02:03:05,945
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you guys think?

1747
02:03:06,186 --> 02:03:06,566
[SPEAKER_08]: You!

1748
02:03:06,906 --> 02:03:09,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, here is tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge Cage Match.

1749
02:03:10,087 --> 02:03:12,708
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this one isn't too difficult to figure out.

1750
02:03:12,928 --> 02:03:13,908
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't unanimous!

1751
02:03:14,328 --> 02:03:15,749
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it would be, but it was not.

1752
02:03:15,809 --> 02:03:18,389
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was a pretty big landslide nonetheless.

1753
02:03:18,789 --> 02:03:20,330
[SPEAKER_08]: This is tonight's Cage Match winner.

1754
02:03:22,931 --> 02:03:26,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Battle Without Honor or Humanity, the 88 Severed Limbs mix, of course.

1755
02:03:28,502 --> 02:03:31,304
[SPEAKER_08]: wins tonight's Orange Lounge cage match.

1756
02:03:32,465 --> 02:03:33,326
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys cool with that?

1757
02:03:33,766 --> 02:03:34,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1758
02:03:35,067 --> 02:03:35,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1759
02:03:35,848 --> 02:03:37,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki's like, hell yeah, I'm cool with that.

1760
02:03:37,529 --> 02:03:43,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so that'll come back and fight next week and see if it can... The chatroom was saying they want that in all month.

1761
02:03:43,914 --> 02:03:45,275
[SPEAKER_08]: They want to make that one go for a month.

1762
02:03:45,315 --> 02:03:45,675
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

1763
02:03:45,775 --> 02:03:46,096
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

1764
02:03:46,846 --> 02:03:48,306
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1765
02:04:08,613 --> 02:04:13,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Just the artist is credited with DDR, and it's all these DDR songs mixed together, so we'll hear that.

1766
02:04:13,738 --> 02:04:19,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Good Cool featuring Jeff Coot with Blaster, I promised that one, so we're going to hear Blaster this break.

1767
02:04:20,283 --> 02:04:22,285
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know what?

1768
02:04:22,986 --> 02:04:23,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Brad?

1769
02:04:25,328 --> 02:04:26,028
[SPEAKER_08]: I need your help here.

1770
02:04:26,088 --> 02:04:31,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Is Iconoclasm, is that the Taka featuring DJW one?

1771
02:04:31,553 --> 02:04:33,134
[SPEAKER_08]: I cannot, they totally changed their name.

1772
02:04:33,434 --> 02:04:34,816
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if it's that or not.

1773
02:04:35,336 --> 02:04:36,097
[SPEAKER_08]: The Anthem Trance?

1774
02:04:36,117 --> 02:04:36,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Taka.

1775
02:04:37,864 --> 02:04:38,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Taka and DJW.

1776
02:04:38,505 --> 02:04:40,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, we're going to hear that one, too.

1777
02:04:40,086 --> 02:04:43,088
[SPEAKER_08]: The Taka and DJW in the genre of Anthem Trance.

1778
02:04:43,148 --> 02:04:49,233
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Vatam Stellaru, and they call themselves Iconoclasm, which is why I was thrown off, because I couldn't remember what they had called themselves.

1779
02:04:49,633 --> 02:04:50,954
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to hear all that this break.

1780
02:04:51,014 --> 02:04:57,239
[SPEAKER_08]: The DDR Megamix, Good Coolin' Jeff Coot, and Taka and W. When we come back, the FUs of the week.

1781
02:04:57,559 --> 02:04:58,000
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back.

1782
02:06:54,447 --> 02:06:55,855
Thank you for watching!

1783
02:07:24,649 --> 02:07:25,354
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you guys for listening.

1784
02:09:49,962 --> 02:09:50,968
Thank you for watching!

1785
02:10:55,955 --> 02:10:56,677
DarkSakura

1786
02:11:56,068 --> 02:11:57,329
Thank you for watching!

1787
02:12:28,649 --> 02:12:34,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, we are back and you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 68 in progress.

1788
02:12:35,931 --> 02:12:41,813
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're just talking about popping music right now, kind of Loki promoting his cabinet again.

1789
02:12:43,293 --> 02:12:46,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get your guys' reactions to the songs in that set.

1790
02:12:46,054 --> 02:12:49,655
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, we had the DDR Megamix.

1791
02:12:50,175 --> 02:12:51,596
[SPEAKER_08]: We might have a surprise visitor here.

1792
02:12:52,453 --> 02:12:55,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Zero and Jason are here.

1793
02:12:55,275 --> 02:12:55,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

1794
02:12:56,955 --> 02:12:57,436
[SPEAKER_08]: What is up?

1795
02:12:58,596 --> 02:12:58,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1796
02:13:01,618 --> 02:13:02,118
[SPEAKER_08]: My bad.

1797
02:13:05,540 --> 02:13:05,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1798
02:13:06,300 --> 02:13:11,083
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to... Let's revisit the songs in that break.

1799
02:13:11,103 --> 02:13:11,863
[SPEAKER_08]: See what you guys thought of them.

1800
02:13:12,183 --> 02:13:15,505
[SPEAKER_08]: First off was the DDR Megamix from the Pop Music 10 soundtrack.

1801
02:13:19,088 --> 02:13:20,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, great, I played the bag part.

1802
02:13:20,650 --> 02:13:21,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me skip ahead.

1803
02:13:21,311 --> 02:13:28,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, what did you guys think of the DDR Megamix from Pop Music 10?

1804
02:13:28,839 --> 02:13:30,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is bag in there?

1805
02:13:30,140 --> 02:13:31,041
[SPEAKER_08]: That was my thought, too.

1806
02:13:31,081 --> 02:13:31,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is bag in there?

1807
02:13:33,103 --> 02:13:34,525
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not a highlight of DDR.

1808
02:13:34,565 --> 02:13:39,831
[SPEAKER_09]: It's alright, but the thing is, is that, like, do we need to hear, like, Before You anymore?

1809
02:13:41,815 --> 02:13:44,037
[SPEAKER_09]: or D2R or whatever was all those songs in there.

1810
02:13:44,117 --> 02:13:45,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, we've heard those so many times.

1811
02:13:45,418 --> 02:13:46,078
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't need them again.

1812
02:13:46,158 --> 02:13:46,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I agree.

1813
02:13:47,139 --> 02:13:50,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we can make some new before you remix type stuff.

1814
02:13:51,663 --> 02:13:52,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, anyway.

1815
02:13:52,143 --> 02:13:53,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have any thoughts on that movie?

1816
02:13:54,945 --> 02:13:55,486
[SPEAKER_07]: It was okay.

1817
02:13:55,506 --> 02:13:56,707
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1818
02:13:57,467 --> 02:14:03,091
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, I could see them putting this in like another version of DDR just as a thing.

1819
02:14:06,294 --> 02:14:06,794
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, cool.

1820
02:14:07,135 --> 02:14:10,958
[SPEAKER_08]: The other song we heard in that break was Good Cool featuring Jeff Coot with Blame

1821
02:14:12,062 --> 02:14:12,843
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, not Blaine.

1822
02:14:12,863 --> 02:14:13,623
[SPEAKER_08]: That was their other song.

1823
02:14:13,643 --> 02:14:14,524
[SPEAKER_08]: This was Blaster.

1824
02:14:19,869 --> 02:14:21,170
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you guys think of Blaster?

1825
02:14:23,912 --> 02:14:25,594
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about Blaster, but hi, Angel.

1826
02:14:26,943 --> 02:14:27,904
[SPEAKER_08]: What'd you think of Blaster?

1827
02:14:29,045 --> 02:14:29,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Me?

1828
02:14:29,445 --> 02:14:29,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1829
02:14:30,066 --> 02:14:32,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I am a huge Jeff Koop fan, dude.

1830
02:14:33,528 --> 02:14:35,870
[SPEAKER_09]: He makes me warm and gooey inside.

1831
02:14:37,191 --> 02:14:38,953
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nothing compared to his... Hey, shut up.

1832
02:14:39,493 --> 02:14:47,300
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nothing compared to his, like, turning the motor over or blame or blowing my heart away, but since it's Jeff Koop, I'll still...

1833
02:14:48,137 --> 02:14:52,458
[SPEAKER_09]: I still say they need to put Rollercoaster of Love in fucking Guitar Freak.

1834
02:14:52,478 --> 02:14:53,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's true.

1835
02:14:53,518 --> 02:14:55,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever, I mean, I like the Chili Pepper version, though.

1836
02:14:55,379 --> 02:14:55,619
[SPEAKER_09]: That's...

1837
02:15:12,113 --> 02:15:15,459
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1838
02:15:24,420 --> 02:15:26,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody in the chatroom says Jeff Cooch.

1839
02:15:27,722 --> 02:15:31,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Jeff Cooch.

1840
02:15:32,825 --> 02:15:41,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Also in that break we heard Taka and DJW coming together as Iconoclasm with a song called, and this is kind of tricky, it's Vatum Stellarum.

1841
02:15:42,650 --> 02:15:43,431
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit of Latin there.

1842
02:15:47,793 --> 02:15:50,255
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you think of the Taka and DJW one?

1843
02:15:52,543 --> 02:16:01,805
[SPEAKER_09]: I like DJ Taka, but he's been bringing out a lot of more generic stuff lately, and I think he kind of poisoned DJW with that genericness he's been bringing out.

1844
02:16:01,845 --> 02:16:04,546
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not blown away by this song, but it is still pretty good.

1845
02:16:05,846 --> 02:16:09,947
[SPEAKER_08]: It's No Rainbow Flyer, which I think is the best song he's done in a long time.

1846
02:16:10,108 --> 02:16:11,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it has the word rainbow in it.

1847
02:16:11,488 --> 02:16:12,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, shut up.

1848
02:16:13,148 --> 02:16:14,229
[SPEAKER_08]: But it is...

1849
02:16:16,542 --> 02:16:17,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Decent, I guess.

1850
02:16:18,362 --> 02:16:19,503
[SPEAKER_08]: But it sounds just like emotion.

1851
02:16:20,423 --> 02:16:22,984
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't hear DJW really in it at all.

1852
02:16:23,844 --> 02:16:26,064
[SPEAKER_08]: If you just told me it was a DJ Taka song, I would have believed you.

1853
02:16:27,165 --> 02:16:27,645
[SPEAKER_09]: You would have what?

1854
02:16:28,405 --> 02:16:30,645
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have believed you if you just told me it was a DJ Taka song.

1855
02:16:32,086 --> 02:16:33,746
[SPEAKER_09]: The DJW part is very subtle.

1856
02:16:34,226 --> 02:16:37,627
[SPEAKER_09]: If I can recall, I heard some quick piano-y stuff in there.

1857
02:16:37,687 --> 02:16:40,328
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of like a DJW thing to do.

1858
02:16:41,208 --> 02:16:43,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Really fast piano playing is DJW's thing.

1859
02:16:43,749 --> 02:16:44,889
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you have any thoughts on that, Loki?

1860
02:16:46,698 --> 02:16:47,179
[SPEAKER_09]: It was okay.

1861
02:16:47,359 --> 02:16:47,999
[SPEAKER_09]: I liked it.

1862
02:16:48,079 --> 02:16:50,001
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounded kind of trancy and nice.

1863
02:16:50,942 --> 02:16:52,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Trancy and nice.

1864
02:16:52,403 --> 02:16:52,763
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1865
02:16:52,843 --> 02:16:58,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Taka just hasn't really... I just don't really care about Taka and Tack anymore.

1866
02:16:58,568 --> 02:17:03,372
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Tack did better stuff on his album, you know, the remixes, like Paranoia and stuff.

1867
02:17:05,674 --> 02:17:18,922
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Tarka's last really, really good song was stuff off maybe, or maybe Rainbow Flyer probably was his last really good song.

1868
02:17:19,042 --> 02:17:21,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, Fifth Mix was, like, good for both of them.

1869
02:17:21,744 --> 02:17:22,624
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that was some good stuff.

1870
02:17:22,644 --> 02:17:23,185
[SPEAKER_08]: You're talking about D.R.

1871
02:17:23,205 --> 02:17:23,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Fifth Mix?

1872
02:17:24,025 --> 02:17:24,825
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Beatmania.

1873
02:17:24,965 --> 02:17:25,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Beatmania 5th?

1874
02:17:25,886 --> 02:17:26,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Or 2DX, I mean.

1875
02:17:27,206 --> 02:17:28,367
[SPEAKER_09]: 2DX, oh, 5th Style.

1876
02:17:28,407 --> 02:17:29,447
[SPEAKER_09]: 5th Style, yeah.

1877
02:17:29,547 --> 02:17:30,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, what songs?

1878
02:17:30,387 --> 02:17:31,328
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't... V?

1879
02:17:31,528 --> 02:17:33,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, like, Absolute was on there.

1880
02:17:33,929 --> 02:17:36,509
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Absolute's from, yeah, 3rd.

1881
02:17:37,210 --> 02:17:37,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

1882
02:17:37,890 --> 02:17:41,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, so, Abyss, that was on there.

1883
02:17:42,692 --> 02:17:43,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Sync.

1884
02:17:43,592 --> 02:17:44,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Sync, well, yeah.

1885
02:17:45,273 --> 02:17:46,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell yeah, Outface, always good.

1886
02:17:48,414 --> 02:17:52,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Summer Vacation, that was the last good thing that... Outface?

1887
02:17:53,031 --> 02:17:54,452
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't really care for Quasar?

1888
02:17:55,593 --> 02:17:55,733
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1889
02:17:56,574 --> 02:17:57,335
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1890
02:17:58,716 --> 02:18:02,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Sync and Summer Vacation are still way better, but I don't know, Quasar's still alright.

1891
02:18:03,899 --> 02:18:08,323
[SPEAKER_08]: See, it's like Taka is just getting about as old as Naoki Underground.

1892
02:18:08,863 --> 02:18:12,646
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that stuff is so generic and repetitive sounding.

1893
02:18:13,046 --> 02:18:14,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Why does it have to be Naoki Underground?

1894
02:18:14,387 --> 02:18:15,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't you just say Naoki?

1895
02:18:16,288 --> 02:18:18,210
[SPEAKER_09]: That's as old and generic as you get right there.

1896
02:18:19,215 --> 02:18:25,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, at least he's like, you know, he does different genres of music, even though he may put himself under different names and stuff.

1897
02:18:25,720 --> 02:18:33,306
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just... Well, DJ Taka's been doing a lot of, like with Night Style, like these more J-pop-y sounding songs lately.

1898
02:18:33,386 --> 02:18:36,529
[SPEAKER_09]: So he's kind of changing up his genre, but I don't think he's doing very good.

1899
02:18:36,549 --> 02:18:38,931
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to hear Sylvia Drive ever again.

1900
02:18:39,051 --> 02:18:42,133
[SPEAKER_08]: I was pissed off that he didn't even, um, Emotion 2003 anyways.

1901
02:18:42,173 --> 02:18:46,296
[SPEAKER_08]: They've already done a romantic style of Emotion that was in, um, what was it...

1902
02:18:47,177 --> 02:18:50,961
[SPEAKER_09]: See, they made Romantic style, and that was pretty cool.

1903
02:18:50,981 --> 02:18:52,243
[SPEAKER_09]: I liked that better than the original.

1904
02:18:52,323 --> 02:18:57,949
[SPEAKER_09]: But then they're like, we need it to be a little more trancy, so let's do Romantic 2003 or whatever it's called.

1905
02:18:58,970 --> 02:18:59,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Lame.

1906
02:18:59,611 --> 02:19:01,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think it was a little overdone.

1907
02:19:02,534 --> 02:19:03,535
[SPEAKER_09]: So what are we talking about?

1908
02:19:04,205 --> 02:19:07,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, you guys are having an argument about whether Taka sold out or not or whatever it is.

1909
02:19:07,668 --> 02:19:09,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think Taka's just getting soft.

1910
02:19:09,349 --> 02:19:09,649
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1911
02:19:10,409 --> 02:19:12,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, uh, let's do the FUs of the week then.

1912
02:19:12,851 --> 02:19:14,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Speaking of ranting about things.

1913
02:19:14,232 --> 02:19:14,932
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll leave now.

1914
02:19:15,052 --> 02:19:16,834
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time for the FUs of the week!

1915
02:19:22,838 --> 02:19:23,598
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, this is bad.

1916
02:19:23,738 --> 02:19:25,399
[SPEAKER_20]: Here is justice.

1917
02:19:25,760 --> 02:19:28,261
[SPEAKER_13]: Here is punishment.

1918
02:19:28,722 --> 02:19:31,644
[SPEAKER_13]: Here is... This is fucked up.

1919
02:19:31,684 --> 02:19:31,764
[SPEAKER_13]: Here.

1920
02:19:33,075 --> 02:19:41,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this is the part where Jamie would usually do her FUs, because this is her little retarded baby that has grown into an hour-long segment every week's show.

1921
02:19:41,903 --> 02:19:49,569
[SPEAKER_08]: But she didn't send me anything over mail, or I haven't gotten anything on email, and I didn't get a phone call or anything.

1922
02:19:50,090 --> 02:19:53,213
[SPEAKER_08]: So, FU to Jamie for not sending me FUs!

1923
02:19:53,573 --> 02:19:54,013
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm kidding.

1924
02:19:54,053 --> 02:19:54,394
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kidding.

1925
02:19:54,414 --> 02:19:54,774
[SPEAKER_08]: We miss you.

1926
02:19:54,814 --> 02:19:55,294
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll do Jamie's.

1927
02:19:55,735 --> 02:19:56,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck you to traffic.

1928
02:19:56,796 --> 02:19:57,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck you to being sick.

1929
02:19:58,457 --> 02:20:00,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck you to Xbox, there you go.

1930
02:20:00,859 --> 02:20:02,360
[SPEAKER_09]: And fuck you to Roosevelt Golf Line Children.

1931
02:20:02,481 --> 02:20:05,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck you to bad Chinese food, fuck you to Roosevelt Golf Line Children.

1932
02:20:05,983 --> 02:20:07,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, fair enough.

1933
02:20:07,445 --> 02:20:09,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so we're just going to skip to Loki then.

1934
02:20:10,187 --> 02:20:14,451
[SPEAKER_08]: And Loki, per your request earlier this week, I went ahead and changed your music.

1935
02:20:18,814 --> 02:20:20,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes, I remember that now.

1936
02:20:21,536 --> 02:20:23,398
[SPEAKER_02]: God damn it, why does he have to remember everything?

1937
02:20:25,919 --> 02:20:28,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck your goddamn speed music.

1938
02:20:28,322 --> 02:20:28,982
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate it.

1939
02:20:29,163 --> 02:20:32,086
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact that you make speed Christmas music is even worse.

1940
02:20:32,366 --> 02:20:33,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I hate Christmas music.

1941
02:20:34,068 --> 02:20:40,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Why the hell does every store in the face of the earth have to play goddamn Christmas music, like, right after fucking Halloween?

1942
02:20:41,336 --> 02:20:41,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?

1943
02:20:41,797 --> 02:20:43,118
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not Christmas yet.

1944
02:20:45,660 --> 02:20:48,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

1945
02:21:05,239 --> 02:21:12,924
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, you know, instead of having the songs nice and short, they have to, you know, make extended versions and just speed them twice as fast as their regular size.

1946
02:21:13,384 --> 02:21:15,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Mmm, Gearbox, uh-huh.

1947
02:21:16,406 --> 02:21:19,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey now, Gearbox star, get your game on.

1948
02:21:19,227 --> 02:21:19,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sorry!

1949
02:21:24,227 --> 02:21:29,013
[SPEAKER_02]: My second FU of the week is going to be going to G4 for their poor programming.

1950
02:21:29,453 --> 02:21:35,360
[SPEAKER_08]: I watched a nice segment on Dance Dance Revolution and these people covering it knew nothing about the game.

1951
02:21:35,661 --> 02:21:37,683
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even think they knew what they were doing there.

1952
02:21:38,003 --> 02:21:41,908
[SPEAKER_08]: They were talking to these people asking them, So, what's your highest score?

1953
02:21:42,048 --> 02:21:43,070
[SPEAKER_08]: And the guy's looking at them like...

1954
02:21:44,090 --> 02:21:46,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, have you seen the new Tetris game?

1955
02:21:46,232 --> 02:21:47,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Aeris dies.

1956
02:22:06,368 --> 02:22:09,572
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's stupid, it's like, we have to recolonize our planet.

1957
02:22:09,773 --> 02:22:12,676
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a planet, it's a puzzle game.

1958
02:22:13,117 --> 02:22:14,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Puzzle game.

1959
02:22:14,859 --> 02:22:16,281
[SPEAKER_02]: No need for anything else.

1960
02:22:17,082 --> 02:22:17,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?

1961
02:22:18,104 --> 02:22:18,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Um.

1962
02:22:19,378 --> 02:22:34,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, fuck you too, a lot of the stupid movies that are coming out lately, like Master and Commander of the Far Sea, I mean, no one wants to see stupid people sailing and ships blowing up and ships, shit like that.

1963
02:22:34,784 --> 02:22:37,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, this is the What's His Name movie, right?

1964
02:22:37,865 --> 02:22:39,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that guy who doesn't make good stuff.

1965
02:22:39,826 --> 02:22:40,806
[SPEAKER_09]: What's his name, the Australian guy?

1966
02:22:41,892 --> 02:22:42,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Russell Crowe?

1967
02:22:42,472 --> 02:22:43,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Russell Crowe, yeah.

1968
02:22:43,953 --> 02:22:46,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Who wants to watch Russell Crowe be a stupid sailor god?

1969
02:22:47,094 --> 02:22:47,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Russell Crowe is true.

1970
02:22:47,915 --> 02:22:49,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wait, does he die in the movie?

1971
02:22:49,835 --> 02:22:50,015
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1972
02:22:50,296 --> 02:22:51,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, then it's not worth saying.

1973
02:22:52,116 --> 02:22:58,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Does he, like, bust out, like, a shield and sword and start cutting people's heads off and stuff and say, I am the greatest gladiator?

1974
02:22:59,399 --> 02:22:59,559
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1975
02:23:00,500 --> 02:23:05,622
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, yeah, that sucked, and, um,

1976
02:23:07,484 --> 02:23:14,847
[SPEAKER_08]: I had more at Fuse earlier this week, and because it's Sunday, I just get all relaxed by the weekend, and half of the stuff goes away.

1977
02:23:14,867 --> 02:23:21,549
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought that the music might help, might jog my memory, but all I can say is I hate old people.

1978
02:23:23,089 --> 02:23:25,970
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate them to hell, and old people just really suck.

1979
02:23:26,050 --> 02:23:29,952
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate reality TV, because these new shows that they come up with, like this

1980
02:23:30,692 --> 02:23:31,152
[SPEAKER_08]: And finally, um...

1981
02:23:59,324 --> 02:24:24,860
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, I can't, oh, FU Yahoo for covering the dumbest news stories ever, like, for instance, the solar flares, no one cares about the solar flares, didn't happen, nothing really, you know, happened to us, um, also, just, they have, like, um, studies about, like, different things, like, games are addictive, you know, that shit, it's really lame, like, um,

1982
02:24:26,360 --> 02:24:29,501
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I'm saying, if you set fire to yourself, it will hurt.

1983
02:24:30,841 --> 02:24:33,142
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm done.

1984
02:24:36,163 --> 02:24:42,144
[SPEAKER_08]: I like boobies too, but just because I like boobies doesn't mean you have to keep writing boobies.

1985
02:24:46,805 --> 02:24:47,505
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

1986
02:24:48,706 --> 02:24:49,006
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done.

1987
02:24:51,486 --> 02:24:52,887
[SPEAKER_02]: And burn this fucking CD!

1988
02:24:54,793 --> 02:24:56,633
[SPEAKER_02]: They sent you Beethoven!

1989
02:24:59,874 --> 02:25:04,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, uh, hold on, I think of something else real fast, I'm dealing with some things in the chatroom, hold on.

1990
02:25:06,195 --> 02:25:08,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's watch some gay porn so we can get our hate back.

1991
02:25:09,316 --> 02:25:10,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking A, dude, seriously.

1992
02:25:11,477 --> 02:25:17,738
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I hate fucking pop-ups and shit, and I'm still getting them like hell, and all these people are telling me, you know,

1993
02:25:18,188 --> 02:25:20,869
[SPEAKER_08]: They actually increased my penis size and all this stuff.

1994
02:25:21,550 --> 02:25:22,630
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just really annoying.

1995
02:25:22,870 --> 02:25:23,671
[SPEAKER_08]: They can hit, man.

1996
02:25:25,912 --> 02:25:28,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you know that they say my breasts are too small, too?

1997
02:25:28,853 --> 02:25:29,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know, me too.

1998
02:25:29,573 --> 02:25:30,354
[SPEAKER_09]: I get this all the time.

1999
02:25:30,694 --> 02:25:32,535
[SPEAKER_09]: And my clitoris is too small.

2000
02:25:32,595 --> 02:25:34,055
[SPEAKER_09]: My ovaries are too big.

2001
02:25:34,135 --> 02:25:41,619
[SPEAKER_08]: If we were to follow all their, you know, instructions, we'd be titty-fucking ourselves every day, so... Damn, and the only spam I get is Tubgirl.

2002
02:25:44,700 --> 02:25:44,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

2003
02:25:45,601 --> 02:25:45,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

2004
02:25:47,628 --> 02:25:50,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone go to www.tubgirl.com right now.

2005
02:26:12,900 --> 02:26:17,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm not going to give it out over the air, because who knows, and everybody's going to send me Tug Girl, because they think it'll be funny.

2006
02:26:18,224 --> 02:26:26,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, everybody, go to www.goatse.cx Jesus Christ, just kill yourself.

2007
02:26:26,369 --> 02:26:27,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's it, my turn, my turn.

2008
02:26:30,191 --> 02:26:30,651
[SPEAKER_08]: My F.U.

2009
02:26:30,671 --> 02:26:34,734
[SPEAKER_08]: of the week goes to these fucking retarded internet jokes that are five years old.

2010
02:26:37,079 --> 02:26:42,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, go to Goat Say, it's funny, this guy stretching his ass, ew.

2011
02:26:42,703 --> 02:26:43,284
[SPEAKER_02]: God.

2012
02:26:43,304 --> 02:26:49,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Top Girl, oh, it's so funny, hey, she shit herself, isn't that great, ew, look at that.

2013
02:26:50,049 --> 02:26:52,271
[SPEAKER_08]: God, shut the fuck up.

2014
02:26:52,771 --> 02:27:00,574
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're going to send around an internet joke, at least make it a funny internet joke, like ghetto Barbie or whatever that was.

2015
02:27:00,674 --> 02:27:02,695
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm sorry.

2016
02:27:02,775 --> 02:27:06,336
[SPEAKER_09]: I know a lot of people hate it still, but you can't go wrong with All Your Base.

2017
02:27:06,356 --> 02:27:06,997
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a classic.

2018
02:27:07,057 --> 02:27:07,797
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the original.

2019
02:27:08,337 --> 02:27:12,739
[SPEAKER_09]: This is funny because Japanese people actually wrote this this way.

2020
02:27:12,899 --> 02:27:15,220
[SPEAKER_08]: All Your Base was not part of my FU.

2021
02:27:15,280 --> 02:27:16,800
[SPEAKER_08]: That can stay.

2022
02:27:16,961 --> 02:27:19,361
[SPEAKER_08]: But Goat Say and all this other stuff has to go.

2023
02:27:19,441 --> 02:27:20,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that's dumb.

2024
02:27:21,454 --> 02:27:23,796
[SPEAKER_08]: or at least come up with something else funny.

2025
02:27:23,836 --> 02:27:30,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, how about a woman in a new compromising position or a guy doing another amazing thing to his body.

2026
02:27:33,783 --> 02:27:35,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, send me that.

2027
02:27:35,044 --> 02:27:36,165
[SPEAKER_09]: No one's sent me that yet.

2028
02:27:37,666 --> 02:27:42,449
[SPEAKER_09]: There's the new fetish where women kick guys full on in the groin really hard and they get off on it.

2029
02:27:42,589 --> 02:27:43,950
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll probably be a new joke soon.

2030
02:27:43,970 --> 02:27:45,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, somebody send me bum fights.

2031
02:27:45,771 --> 02:27:46,712
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't seen this yet.

2032
02:27:46,752 --> 02:27:47,993
[SPEAKER_08]: It might still be funny, see?

2033
02:27:48,033 --> 02:27:48,914
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just joking.

2034
02:27:50,188 --> 02:27:50,588
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2035
02:27:50,969 --> 02:27:51,369
[SPEAKER_08]: God.

2036
02:27:54,471 --> 02:28:03,276
[SPEAKER_08]: I just hate it when people post this on forums to try to, like, there's something new that, like, ha, this is so funny, my friend just showed it to me.

2037
02:28:03,556 --> 02:28:07,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Chances are if your friend just showed it to you, it's like five years old.

2038
02:28:07,919 --> 02:28:09,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Your friend's just retarded.

2039
02:28:09,320 --> 02:28:10,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you're me.

2040
02:28:10,360 --> 02:28:11,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen fart pudding?

2041
02:28:13,727 --> 02:28:14,388
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to!

2042
02:28:15,790 --> 02:28:21,219
[SPEAKER_08]: My favorite ones are the ones where they post stuff like about, New DDR Extreme skin for Step Mania!

2043
02:28:21,279 --> 02:28:22,420
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a link to Goatse.

2044
02:28:23,282 --> 02:28:24,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Redirect.

2045
02:28:26,246 --> 02:28:28,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, if you're the one that's... Those are the best.

2046
02:28:29,841 --> 02:28:31,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you can go to hell if that's you doing that.

2047
02:28:32,242 --> 02:28:34,523
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a special place in hell, just for you.

2048
02:28:35,044 --> 02:28:37,825
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to do one that sends you to, like, install Gator on your computer.

2049
02:28:37,845 --> 02:28:38,625
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be the best.

2050
02:28:38,966 --> 02:28:40,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, I don't even know how to do it.

2051
02:28:40,967 --> 02:28:45,209
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to buy... The goats that go down, I'm going to buy it and put in a Gator ad.

2052
02:28:45,269 --> 02:28:47,210
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to make zillions of money off this.

2053
02:28:48,730 --> 02:28:51,351
[SPEAKER_08]: What was that other one you were talking about last week?

2054
02:28:52,512 --> 02:28:52,752
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

2055
02:28:52,992 --> 02:28:55,713
[SPEAKER_08]: The one that we were... Yeah, Gain, I think.

2056
02:28:55,793 --> 02:28:59,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Gain, Gator... No, the one that you could not get rid of last week.

2057
02:28:59,054 --> 02:29:02,236
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the... Not Jupiter, but it was one of them in that family.

2058
02:29:02,856 --> 02:29:06,177
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like Jupiter, but with an X. Lop.

2059
02:29:06,297 --> 02:29:07,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Lop.com.

2060
02:29:07,178 --> 02:29:07,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Lop.

2061
02:29:07,798 --> 02:29:08,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Ugh, evil.

2062
02:29:08,818 --> 02:29:10,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Do not visit Lop.com.

2063
02:29:10,279 --> 02:29:11,119
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll be sorry.

2064
02:29:11,139 --> 02:29:12,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2065
02:29:12,880 --> 02:29:14,120
[SPEAKER_08]: It's worse than Tubgirl.

2066
02:29:14,560 --> 02:29:14,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2067
02:29:14,901 --> 02:29:15,721
[SPEAKER_03]: What's Lop.com?

2068
02:29:17,935 --> 02:29:19,196
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like worse than Gator.

2069
02:29:19,316 --> 02:29:20,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Gler Gallery.

2070
02:29:20,556 --> 02:29:21,136
[SPEAKER_08]: That kind of stuff?

2071
02:29:21,337 --> 02:29:21,477
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

2072
02:29:23,498 --> 02:29:23,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2073
02:29:26,099 --> 02:29:27,079
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

2074
02:29:27,179 --> 02:29:28,860
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it for my FUs of the week.

2075
02:29:30,701 --> 02:29:33,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's go around the room and get other FUs of the week.

2076
02:29:33,642 --> 02:29:35,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Dark Child has a microphone so he can start.

2077
02:29:36,484 --> 02:29:39,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, before I do my FUs, I have to give a shout out to my girlfriend.

2078
02:29:39,685 --> 02:29:40,265
[SPEAKER_03]: I love her.

2079
02:29:40,285 --> 02:29:40,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Blah, blah, blah.

[SPEAKER_08]: It's a chain that's Midwest in the United States.

2097
02:30:43,175 --> 02:30:44,836
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the dumbest fucking idiots ever.

2098
02:30:44,856 --> 02:30:46,797
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't even know what backorder means.

2099
02:30:47,957 --> 02:30:55,140
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's just kind of like common knowledge shit, and I hate them and they're all inbred, um, tics, so, yeah.

[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have any FUs of the week?

2103
02:31:06,477 --> 02:31:07,818
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I guess I have a couple of FUs.

2104
02:31:07,838 --> 02:31:12,582
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to companies that like to outsource everything to India to save money.

2105
02:31:13,583 --> 02:31:15,964
[SPEAKER_04]: They put all people out of jobs and they all wander around.

2106
02:31:16,665 --> 02:31:20,248
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes it nice for when I'm hiring, but, you know, it still sucks when people are out of jobs.

2107
02:31:21,289 --> 02:31:22,630
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to lots of bills.

[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, it tripled.

2112
02:31:36,567 --> 02:31:39,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if it's tripled, whoever has princesses, it's tripled.

2113
02:31:40,711 --> 02:31:45,275
[SPEAKER_04]: How about... That's all I have, because I can't think of anything.

2114
02:31:45,715 --> 02:31:46,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, fair enough.

2115
02:31:47,057 --> 02:31:49,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Bradley, Arcadian42, what are your FUs of the week?

[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck you to bad drivers, of course.

2121
02:32:03,878 --> 02:32:08,360
[SPEAKER_10]: One guy almost tried to hit me when he was changing lanes, but I think the cops caught him, so fuck you to him.

2122
02:32:09,501 --> 02:32:11,202
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you to the cops for catching that idiot.

2123
02:32:12,863 --> 02:32:14,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck you to disappearing pencils.

2124
02:32:14,164 --> 02:32:17,606
[SPEAKER_10]: They run away from me and disappear to different rooms.

2125
02:32:17,626 --> 02:32:18,666
[SPEAKER_10]: They say, where did the pencil go?

2126
02:32:18,686 --> 02:32:22,709
[SPEAKER_10]: I have, like, four pencils and they disappear at various points.

2127
02:32:23,369 --> 02:32:24,670
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, some more pencils.

[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, um, up next, let's hear from Zero, your FUs of the week.

2130
02:32:36,131 --> 02:32:44,118
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a whole lot, but I will have to say fuck you to the customers who come in and tell me that I don't know what I'm doing, even though I sell video games and I've been playing them all my fucking life.

2131
02:32:45,139 --> 02:32:52,606
[SPEAKER_07]: And, yeah, fuck you to people who want Karaoke Revolution and we don't have it, and so I have to go get it for them.

2132
02:32:53,470 --> 02:32:55,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Added in at a decreased price.

2133
02:32:57,936 --> 02:32:58,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2134
02:33:00,299 --> 02:33:02,142
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it didn't matter because I wanted to get out of it.

2135
02:33:02,382 --> 02:33:03,584
[SPEAKER_07]: I needed to take a break.

2136
02:33:03,764 --> 02:33:04,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

2137
02:33:07,950 --> 02:33:08,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we were out.

2138
02:33:09,606 --> 02:33:29,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, fuck you to having a car now, because I have to go and fucking park all the way at Cal Expo, because a stupid fucking mall security little fucking police squad dropouts come up and harass our store specifically and tell us, if you park your cars anywhere else but Cal Expo, we're gonna tow it.

2139
02:33:30,654 --> 02:33:33,035
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're like picking on us, so we're making their job harder.

2140
02:33:34,116 --> 02:33:34,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

2141
02:33:35,549 --> 02:33:42,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and fuck you to people who tell me to fuck you because I'm getting like a TV and a computer.

2142
02:33:43,174 --> 02:33:43,594
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

2143
02:33:43,734 --> 02:33:44,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are gifts, dick.

2144
02:33:46,095 --> 02:33:49,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, Jason, you're a dick.

2145
02:33:50,938 --> 02:33:54,661
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the way, that stuff that I'm getting is a gift, so fuck off.

2146
02:33:55,421 --> 02:33:59,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Not like you don't get to benefit from it anyway, so shut up.

2147
02:34:00,784 --> 02:34:05,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and which reminds me, I'm gonna have everybody over Friday night to play games on...

[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this one.

02:34:07,221 --> 02:34:07,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody.

2150
02:34:08,962 --> 02:34:09,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody.

2151
02:34:10,383 --> 02:34:11,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, not on my TV.

2152
02:34:11,203 --> 02:34:12,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell no.

2153
02:34:13,024 --> 02:34:14,946
[SPEAKER_07]: You could go stand in the back of the house and do it.

2154
02:34:15,346 --> 02:34:16,887
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a good game, come on.

2155
02:34:16,987 --> 02:34:18,908
[SPEAKER_07]: On a 17-inch computer monitor, how about that?

2156
02:34:19,669 --> 02:34:21,890
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's really pretty much about it.

2157
02:34:21,970 --> 02:34:25,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, and fuck you to not being here for so long because I didn't have a car.

2158
02:34:25,192 --> 02:34:26,974
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, fuck not having a car too.

2159
02:34:27,654 --> 02:34:29,415
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'll be back like every week now.

2160
02:34:29,655 --> 02:34:30,696
[SPEAKER_07]: So yay, I'm done.

2161
02:34:34,113 --> 02:34:37,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know, this is funny, because we were just saying the other day, we haven't seen Zero in forever.

2162
02:34:37,874 --> 02:34:41,656
[SPEAKER_08]: And here I was, thinking it was just going to be me and Loki here tonight, stretching for material.

2163
02:34:42,136 --> 02:34:45,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, Brad, your turn, FU's of the Week.

2164
02:34:45,517 --> 02:34:46,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you sing a different song now?

2165
02:34:47,278 --> 02:34:47,438
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

2166
02:34:47,958 --> 02:34:48,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Now?

2167
02:34:48,438 --> 02:34:48,658
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

2168
02:34:48,918 --> 02:34:49,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything, I don't care.

2169
02:34:49,898 --> 02:34:51,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, hold on, okay, here you go, here you go.

2170
02:34:52,819 --> 02:34:53,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Here you go.

2171
02:34:53,640 --> 02:34:54,380
[SPEAKER_08]: You can have a line, Suki.

2172
02:34:55,757 --> 02:34:56,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh wow, thanks.

2173
02:34:56,817 --> 02:34:58,038
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, the FUs please.

2174
02:34:58,358 --> 02:35:06,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, uh, of course the old classic FU to this segment, it's stupid, um, and to be the great hypocrisy type thing, you know, I'll go ahead and give another FU.

2175
02:35:06,780 --> 02:35:12,822
[SPEAKER_09]: FU to you people who complain about G4, at least you've got the money to or have G4, like, and have cable.

2176
02:35:13,442 --> 02:35:16,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I have to watch the same three channels over and over again.

2177
02:35:17,003 --> 02:35:18,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you Network Local Television.

2178
02:35:20,044 --> 02:35:23,064
[SPEAKER_09]: But then again, I do get at least CSI and cheaters.

2179
02:35:24,365 --> 02:35:24,745
[SPEAKER_09]: What's this?

2180
02:35:25,748 --> 02:35:26,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell yeah.

2181
02:35:26,288 --> 02:35:30,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, fuck both of you, because my TV doesn't even get the reception for those three channels.

2182
02:35:31,892 --> 02:35:42,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Mine doesn't, my TV doesn't, but they have, like, this, uh, this little cable thing that's an antenna that's, like, this huge, supposed to be a huge antenna on top of the whole apartment complex, but you know what I think it is?

2183
02:35:42,200 --> 02:35:53,668
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, like, a piece of tinfoil that's attached to this cable, because I cannot get Fox, like, hardly ever, which sucks, because Fox has, like, I think, Simpsons on it and stuff, and... Fuck it.

2184
02:35:54,848 --> 02:35:55,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so...

[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, it's like fruit.

2239
02:38:22,657 --> 02:38:24,979
[SPEAKER_03]: You want it just before it's ripe and ready to be eaten.

2240

[SPEAKER_08]: RYC3, Rice Um... Yeah, I got the FP to Paul Terry, I guess that was it Can I get one more?

[SPEAKER_08]: Baka wants to give an FU to a family member who will not let him listen to the rest of the show.

2257
02:39:55,030 --> 02:39:58,112

2258
02:39:58,192 --> 02:39:58,672
[SPEAKER_08]: That's too bad.

2259

2270
02:47:03,510 --> 02:47:09,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge mainlining music in Morse Show?

2271
02:47:09,458 --> 02:47:16,468
[SPEAKER_03]: The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

2272
02:47:16,769 --> 02:47:16,889
[SPEAKER_21]: It's...

2273
02:47:18,297 --> 02:47:18,738
[SPEAKER_21]: on Earthly.

2274
02:47:18,958 --> 02:47:22,701
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like being at a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

2275
02:47:23,141 --> 02:47:30,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we're back on Orange Lounge Radio, and I'm opening up the floor for some quick Ask Orange Lounge before we go off air tonight.

2276
02:47:31,088 --> 02:47:38,014
[SPEAKER_08]: But first, while you guys send those questions in over private message to Sky, let's see what you guys thought of those songs.

2277
02:47:38,114 --> 02:47:40,075
[SPEAKER_08]: The chat room certainly had some strong opinion on these.

2278
02:47:40,576 --> 02:47:45,420
[SPEAKER_08]: The first song we heard in that break was Dez Q, that's Dez Ro and Tack, with a song called Jack.

2279
02:47:50,277 --> 02:47:52,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, Brad, what'd you think of that?

2280
02:47:52,617 --> 02:47:53,738
[SPEAKER_08]: The Desque with Jack.

2281
02:47:54,878 --> 02:47:55,358
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it.

2282
02:47:55,438 --> 02:47:58,279
[SPEAKER_09]: It's distress and, uh, frickin' gravity mixed together.

2283
02:47:58,519 --> 02:47:59,219
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what's interesting?

2284
02:47:59,259 --> 02:48:02,420
[SPEAKER_08]: The chatroom, chatroom, worst reviews of the night.

2285
02:48:02,480 --> 02:48:03,881
[SPEAKER_08]: They said that song is god-awful.

2286
02:48:04,001 --> 02:48:04,761
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't like it at all.

2287
02:48:04,821 --> 02:48:05,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck them.

2288
02:48:06,122 --> 02:48:08,102
[SPEAKER_08]: This show isn't for them.

2289
02:48:08,862 --> 02:48:10,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Big fuck you to the chatroom.

2290
02:48:11,918 --> 02:48:18,843
[SPEAKER_08]: I, I, you know what, I, um, I don't think it's awful, but it's, um, for TAC, it's pretty bad.

2291
02:48:19,343 --> 02:48:20,684
[SPEAKER_08]: I expect better from TAC.

2292
02:48:22,045 --> 02:48:23,506
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that's me personally.

2293
02:48:23,926 --> 02:48:25,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, wah, exactly.

2294
02:48:25,207 --> 02:48:26,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't you go sit on a dick or two?

2295
02:48:27,789 --> 02:48:28,610
[SPEAKER_09]: If, if I could.

2296
02:48:28,630 --> 02:48:34,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, oh, hey, looks like, uh... But you weren't expecting that answer.

2297
02:48:36,735 --> 02:48:38,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, Loki, what'd you think of DesQ?

2298
02:48:38,837 --> 02:48:38,957
[SPEAKER_08]: DesQ.

2299
02:48:39,702 --> 02:48:40,322
[SPEAKER_08]: It's okay.

2300
02:48:40,402 --> 02:48:43,244
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like every other fucking tax song on the face of the earth.

2301
02:48:43,284 --> 02:48:44,524
[SPEAKER_08]: They all sound the same now.

2302
02:48:45,325 --> 02:48:47,826
[SPEAKER_08]: I could remix it, I guess.

2303
02:48:48,786 --> 02:48:49,287
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be fun.

2304
02:48:50,747 --> 02:48:51,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2305
02:48:52,028 --> 02:48:54,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody else have a thought on DezQ with Jack?

2306
02:48:56,877 --> 02:48:57,097
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

2307
02:48:57,738 --> 02:48:59,418
[SPEAKER_08]: I should just listen to Captain Jack.

2308
02:48:59,478 --> 02:49:01,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Captain Jack is much better than Jack, in my opinion.

2309
02:49:01,660 --> 02:49:03,221
[SPEAKER_08]: It does cue with Captain Jack.

2310
02:49:07,623 --> 02:49:11,165
[SPEAKER_08]: The next song we heard was a band called Threep, and the song was called Milk.

2311
02:49:13,526 --> 02:49:15,287
[SPEAKER_08]: A nice, happy, little, uplifting song.

2312
02:49:16,488 --> 02:49:17,809
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember that movie.

2313
02:49:18,029 --> 02:49:22,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, wait, that was Milk Money, where they saved up their milk money to go to a prostitute.

2314
02:49:22,852 --> 02:49:23,352
[SPEAKER_08]: That was cool.

2315
02:49:26,257 --> 02:49:26,757
[SPEAKER_08]: The Place To Be

2316
02:49:52,148 --> 02:49:57,156
[SPEAKER_08]: and certainly those of you that were visiting Bomani Style for a while probably got fucking sick of this song really fast.

2317
02:49:57,336 --> 02:49:58,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, hate it.

2318
02:49:58,437 --> 02:49:59,759
[SPEAKER_08]: At least you got to hear the whole thing.

2319
02:50:01,742 --> 02:50:02,704
[SPEAKER_08]: You just hate it?

2320
02:50:03,605 --> 02:50:05,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, after that one... For some reason only?

2321
02:50:05,227 --> 02:50:06,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, oh, I know I forgot some...

2322
02:50:07,310 --> 02:50:10,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you, Bomani Style, for still having music on your opening page.

2323
02:50:11,777 --> 02:50:12,238
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

2324
02:50:12,698 --> 02:50:14,421
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Bomani Style.

2325
02:50:14,481 --> 02:50:15,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Good guy that runs it.

2326
02:50:15,502 --> 02:50:16,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Paranoid is an awesome guy.

2327
02:50:16,464 --> 02:50:17,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Great site.

2328
02:50:17,045 --> 02:50:17,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Great site.

2329
02:50:17,806 --> 02:50:18,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Good stuff.

2330
02:50:18,347 --> 02:50:19,048
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't like that.

2331
02:50:19,108 --> 02:50:22,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Horrible choice to put the music on the opening page.

2332
02:50:22,973 --> 02:50:26,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Biggest problem is, if it would be nice, here's a suggestion for my staff folks if you're listening.

2333
02:50:27,014 --> 02:50:33,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of having the one song in there and changing it every two weeks or so, put like ten songs that randomize.

2334
02:50:33,797 --> 02:50:36,918
[SPEAKER_08]: So every time... No, better yet, turn off the fucking music altogether.

2335
02:50:36,938 --> 02:50:38,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Do what DR Maniacs did.

2336
02:50:38,959 --> 02:50:41,960
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got like a cookie on your computer, okay?

2337
02:50:42,400 --> 02:50:45,401
[SPEAKER_08]: If you disable it, it doesn't play until you enable it again.

2338
02:50:45,581 --> 02:50:46,721
[SPEAKER_08]: And it does it automatically.

2339
02:50:46,901 --> 02:50:47,582
[SPEAKER_08]: And I love that.

2340
02:50:48,062 --> 02:50:49,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, great site.

2341
02:50:49,202 --> 02:50:50,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Or even, you know what, even better...

2342
02:50:51,323 --> 02:50:53,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Just have it load Orange Lounge Radio when they go to the front page.

2343
02:50:53,804 --> 02:50:54,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Just have it load.

2344
02:50:54,704 --> 02:51:00,126
[SPEAKER_08]: And the problem is the thing that turned it off, it takes a while to load up after you know animations and stuff.

2345
02:51:01,066 --> 02:51:02,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Bad business decision, whoever did that.

2346
02:51:03,367 --> 02:51:06,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Brad, what did you think of that song?

2347
02:51:06,648 --> 02:51:12,130
[SPEAKER_08]: The Desiree core groove genre one that got played the hell out on the money style?

2348
02:51:12,990 --> 02:51:16,411
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you think of the last half of it that you didn't hear on the money style?

2349
02:51:17,732 --> 02:51:18,012
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

2350
02:51:18,432 --> 02:51:19,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, you weren't listening.

2351
02:51:19,673 --> 02:51:20,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other comments on that one?

2352
02:51:22,637 --> 02:51:23,277
[SPEAKER_08]: It sucked.

2353
02:51:24,178 --> 02:51:25,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though I didn't hear the song.

2354
02:51:26,498 --> 02:51:27,719
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not a fan of Dez Ro.

2355
02:51:27,759 --> 02:51:32,240
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just listening to this in my car, this song, and it's not, you know, I don't know.

2356
02:51:32,380 --> 02:51:33,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Dez Ro is just not that great.

2357
02:51:33,781 --> 02:51:39,523
[SPEAKER_08]: I like Daikin Kai, but all the other songs... I can only take... I liked Daikin Kai the first thousand times I heard it.

2358
02:51:40,483 --> 02:51:41,203
[SPEAKER_09]: I still like it.

2359
02:51:42,624 --> 02:51:42,924
[SPEAKER_17]: Huh?

2360
02:51:49,266 --> 02:51:49,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2361
02:51:51,145 --> 02:51:51,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, here we go.

2362
02:51:51,925 --> 02:51:54,806
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to do some quick Ask Orange Lounge before we end tonight's show.

2363
02:51:54,846 --> 02:51:55,386
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys ready?

2364
02:52:02,208 --> 02:52:03,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's Ask Orange Lounge.

2365
02:52:03,989 --> 02:52:05,149
[SPEAKER_08]: Some stupid question.

2366
02:52:05,830 --> 02:52:08,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Why wasn't this song in Karaoke Revolution?

2367
02:52:09,011 --> 02:52:11,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there's no words, Yamora.

2368
02:52:11,311 --> 02:52:12,612
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there is no words.

2369
02:52:12,972 --> 02:52:13,892
[SPEAKER_08]: But I could have made them up.

2370
02:52:14,052 --> 02:52:14,832
[SPEAKER_08]: I could have made them up.

2371
02:52:14,932 --> 02:52:16,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Konami, email me.

2372
02:52:17,193 --> 02:52:18,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob Suckercock.

2373
02:52:19,654 --> 02:52:19,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2374
02:52:21,269 --> 02:52:21,669
[SPEAKER_08]: or two.

2375
02:52:22,270 --> 02:52:23,911
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there's this movement now.

2376
02:52:24,191 --> 02:52:34,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the cool kids in the Bomani scene are trying to flood Konami with requests to put Murmur Twins in... Yeah, I know, I was going to say... What, Zero?

2377
02:52:34,578 --> 02:52:36,720
[SPEAKER_08]: There are no cool kids in the DDR scene, right?

2378
02:52:36,920 --> 02:52:38,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's kind of my thoughts exactly, too.

2379
02:52:38,701 --> 02:52:43,625
[SPEAKER_08]: But nevertheless, the cool kids are trying to get together and put Murmur Twins in the next karaoke revolution.

2380
02:52:44,485 --> 02:52:45,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my advice.

2381
02:52:45,366 --> 02:52:45,566
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2382
02:52:45,586 --> 02:52:46,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't email Konami.

2383
02:52:46,867 --> 02:52:48,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Konami doesn't read those fucking emails.

2384
02:52:48,207 --> 02:52:50,128
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, they have it on their website.

2385
02:52:50,148 --> 02:52:50,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you want to know?

2386
02:52:50,949 --> 02:52:52,570
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they have a request on their website.

2387
02:52:52,590 --> 02:52:54,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Just click here to request a song for them.

2388
02:52:54,050 --> 02:52:54,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing.

2389
02:52:54,671 --> 02:53:06,517
[SPEAKER_03]: If you really want to do it, try and get a hold of ShortyNC or Shintenshi or any of those other old school Bay Area MGL guys from DDR because they all work for fucking Konami right now.

2390
02:53:07,543 --> 02:53:10,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, while you're working there, why don't you bug the shit out of them?

2391
02:53:23,700 --> 02:53:23,960
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

2392
02:53:24,540 --> 02:53:26,161
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not... I think they're trying to be funny.

2393
02:53:26,461 --> 02:53:29,742
[SPEAKER_08]: I get the thing that, like, it's trying to be funny, like, ooh, teehee, let's request Murmur Twins.

2394
02:53:30,163 --> 02:53:30,863
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not funny.

2395
02:53:31,343 --> 02:53:37,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Wouldn't it have been, like, more funny to request Last Message or... See, yes, Last Message I think would have been a little funny.

2396
02:53:37,866 --> 02:53:38,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Murmur Twins, not funny.

2397
02:53:39,126 --> 02:53:41,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to request DMX be put in DDR.

2398
02:53:41,427 --> 02:53:45,789
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to request that no Bomani songs be put in Karaoke Revolution so that we don't ruin the series.

2399
02:53:46,129 --> 02:53:48,270
[SPEAKER_08]: DMX, the singer, the rapper.

2400
02:53:48,310 --> 02:53:48,990
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm just saying.

2401
02:53:49,150 --> 02:53:50,871
[SPEAKER_09]: What the fuck are you talking about?

2402
02:53:51,791 --> 02:54:00,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I the only person who agrees that Konami's original music is better than 98% of the music that comes out nowadays?

2403
02:54:00,236 --> 02:54:02,878
[SPEAKER_08]: All I'm saying is that DDR music needs to stay in DDR.

2404
02:54:02,898 --> 02:54:03,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Check this shit out.

2405
02:54:03,538 --> 02:54:04,759
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR music needs to stay in DDR.

2406
02:54:04,779 --> 02:54:06,260
[SPEAKER_08]: It does not need to be in Karaoke Revolution.

2407
02:54:06,280 --> 02:54:08,361
[SPEAKER_09]: We like Karaoke Revolution because it has the pop songs in it.

2408
02:54:08,541 --> 02:54:09,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Check this out.

2409
02:54:10,262 --> 02:54:12,243
[SPEAKER_09]: A new version of some Bomani game comes out.

2410
02:54:12,303 --> 02:54:12,764
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR...

2411
02:54:13,444 --> 02:54:18,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Poppin' Music, or 2DX, and then people go, have you heard the new license tracks?

2412
02:54:18,548 --> 02:54:20,049
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, what, there's license tracks?

2413
02:54:20,089 --> 02:54:22,471
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't give a fuck, I like Konami's music.

2414
02:54:22,732 --> 02:54:23,872
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the license tracks.

2415
02:54:23,953 --> 02:54:26,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because you're a consumer whore, and how?

2416
02:54:26,254 --> 02:54:26,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck off.

2417
02:54:27,896 --> 02:54:29,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, can we actually answer the questions now?

2418
02:54:31,058 --> 02:54:33,760
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually had two... Hey, could I ask a question to the chatroom first?

2419
02:54:34,021 --> 02:54:34,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, why?

2420
02:54:34,741 --> 02:54:39,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Could I have everyone in the chatroom place FF11 to please post what server they're on and their character name?

2421
02:54:39,813 --> 02:54:40,474
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on Bismarck.

2422
02:54:41,315 --> 02:54:41,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Bismarck.

2423
02:54:41,895 --> 02:54:42,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck Bismarck.

2424
02:54:42,556 --> 02:54:43,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone jump over to Ragnarok.

2425
02:54:45,199 --> 02:54:46,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck Ragnarok.

2426
02:54:46,040 --> 02:54:47,481
[SPEAKER_08]: There's already a game called Ragnarok.

2427
02:54:47,882 --> 02:54:51,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, there was a... Yeah, fuck Ragnarok while we're at it.

2428
02:54:54,128 --> 02:54:54,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Brad?

2429
02:54:55,670 --> 02:54:55,990
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2430
02:54:56,191 --> 02:54:57,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's get to the question.

2431
02:54:58,576 --> 02:54:59,156
[SPEAKER_08]: No, too late.

2432
02:54:59,497 --> 02:55:03,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Same question came from both 23 Magus and Zodiac Knight.

2433
02:55:03,559 --> 02:55:07,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you to the player in Star Wars Galaxy who unlocked the first Jedi.

2434
02:55:08,283 --> 02:55:10,104
[SPEAKER_03]: You fucking grinding bastard.

2435
02:55:10,144 --> 02:55:12,005
[SPEAKER_03]: You, like, mastered every profession in the game.

2436
02:55:12,045 --> 02:55:13,166
[SPEAKER_03]: You suck ass.

2437
02:55:13,786 --> 02:55:18,870
[SPEAKER_03]: And fuck you to Sony Online for making that the secret way to unlocking the goddamn Jedi character.

2438
02:55:18,990 --> 02:55:19,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Jealous.

2439
02:55:19,370 --> 02:55:20,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Table of one.

2440
02:55:20,571 --> 02:55:20,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Jealous.

2441
02:55:21,131 --> 02:55:21,832
[SPEAKER_03]: No, fuck that.

2442
02:55:21,932 --> 02:55:25,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking piss off because it was just about grinding profession.

2443
02:55:25,594 --> 02:55:26,695
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't some super secret.

2444
02:55:26,715 --> 02:55:27,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you enjoyed grinding.

2445
02:55:28,816 --> 02:55:29,096
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

2446
02:55:30,097 --> 02:55:38,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Grinding a profession is when you like just sit there and build biological chemical effectors all day long instead of actually playing the game.

2447
02:55:38,600 --> 02:55:39,980
[SPEAKER_03]: You just sit there building things forever.

2448
02:55:40,681 --> 02:55:46,443
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sucked because it was supposed to be some kind of cool like different way for everyone to unlock AI and it was just master of four different professions.

2449
02:55:50,126 --> 02:55:51,347
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't give a shit.

2450
02:55:51,407 --> 02:55:52,969
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't get a few segments done.

2451
02:55:54,330 --> 02:55:57,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Same question from Magus and Zodiac Knight.

2452
02:55:57,793 --> 02:55:58,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Ask the same question.

2453
02:55:58,814 --> 02:56:00,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Best song in Karaoke Revolution so far?

2454
02:56:00,695 --> 02:56:01,116
[SPEAKER_08]: They want to know.

2455
02:56:02,917 --> 02:56:03,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Zero says none.

2456
02:56:04,418 --> 02:56:04,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

2457
02:56:04,939 --> 02:56:10,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what my girlfriend would say would be, you're the one that I want because it was in Grease and she loves Grease.

2458
02:56:13,712 --> 02:56:17,773
[SPEAKER_08]: I really don't like much of the songs, because I can't sing them, so it kind of sucks.

2459
02:56:18,453 --> 02:56:28,136
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I like Jennifer Lopez's Waiting for Night, because that's like the only song I like of hers, and then Broken Wings is alright, because I listen to that all the time, but that's, you know.

2460
02:56:29,256 --> 02:56:35,698
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as non-game music, I'd have to say Ladies Night, man.

2461
02:56:35,738 --> 02:56:36,738
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

2462
02:56:36,758 --> 02:56:38,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the first unlock we got, Ladies Night.

2463
02:56:39,039 --> 02:56:41,960
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say it's a close tie between Like a Virgin...

2464
02:56:43,306 --> 02:56:44,707
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2465
02:57:10,816 --> 02:57:11,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait a minute, what am I talking about?

2466
02:57:11,817 --> 02:57:13,099
[SPEAKER_09]: My songs are pretty faggoty too.

2467
02:57:13,399 --> 02:57:17,063
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd have to say, probably, I don't know, there's three really good ones on there.

2468
02:57:17,083 --> 02:57:24,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Bizarre Love Triangle, Huey Lewis and the News with Power of Love, and what was that other one I sang?

2469
02:57:27,055 --> 02:57:30,719
[SPEAKER_09]: I did the Huey Lewis one, Bizarre Love Triangle was on there, and what was it?

2470
02:57:31,581 --> 02:57:32,701
[SPEAKER_09]: There was another one, but yeah.

2471
02:57:33,102 --> 02:57:34,122
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the End of the Worlds, we know it?

2472
02:57:34,342 --> 02:57:35,203
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.

2473
02:57:35,623 --> 02:57:36,623
[SPEAKER_09]: REM isn't that great.

2474
02:57:37,063 --> 02:57:37,984
[SPEAKER_09]: You just saw me do it.

2475
02:57:38,024 --> 02:57:38,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Chain of Fools?

2476
02:57:39,104 --> 02:57:39,444
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

2477
02:57:40,565 --> 02:57:42,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Chain, chain, chain.

2478
02:57:42,185 --> 02:57:42,926
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember the other one.

2479
02:57:42,946 --> 02:57:43,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Your underwear.

2480
02:57:43,946 --> 02:57:45,207
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember the other one you did, I'm sorry.

2481
02:57:47,130 --> 02:57:48,131
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, but yeah, you get it.

2482
02:57:48,311 --> 02:57:48,811
[SPEAKER_09]: You get the point.

2483
02:57:49,412 --> 02:57:50,633
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some good songs on there.

2484
02:57:50,673 --> 02:57:51,873
[SPEAKER_08]: The one from Back to the Future?

2485
02:57:51,893 --> 02:57:52,734
[SPEAKER_08]: You already said that one, right?

2486
02:57:52,754 --> 02:57:53,234
[SPEAKER_08]: I already said that.

2487
02:57:53,254 --> 02:57:53,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Power of Love.

2488
02:57:53,855 --> 02:57:54,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Power of Love.

2489
02:57:54,335 --> 02:57:56,316
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

2490
02:57:56,336 --> 02:57:58,578
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple more questions, both coming from AZM Buddy Paul.

2491
02:57:58,598 --> 02:58:00,759
[SPEAKER_08]: These are the last two of the night, so no more questions for him.

2492
02:58:00,799 --> 02:58:01,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hijacking.

2493
02:58:01,860 --> 02:58:02,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

2494
02:58:02,460 --> 02:58:03,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hijacking.

2495
02:58:03,321 --> 02:58:04,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Tough.

2496
02:58:04,602 --> 02:58:05,563
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a live show.

2497
02:58:05,583 --> 02:58:07,604
[SPEAKER_03]: We're coming to you live from the hizzle for shizzle.

2498
02:58:09,605 --> 02:58:16,328
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, SuchAPiehole, AsianBuddyPaw, Have any of you had a near-death experience?

2499
02:58:16,348 --> 02:58:17,369
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a pretty heavy question.

2500
02:58:17,429 --> 02:58:17,689
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2501
02:58:18,550 --> 02:58:19,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Want to explain it?

2502
02:58:21,351 --> 02:58:22,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, hold on.

2503
02:58:23,512 --> 02:58:24,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'll go first.

2504
02:58:25,473 --> 02:58:29,455
[SPEAKER_09]: I went on a groupish date with a friend of mine.

2505
02:58:29,535 --> 02:58:32,777
[SPEAKER_09]: It was this one guy and his date and my date.

2506
02:58:33,297 --> 02:58:36,359
[SPEAKER_09]: And he was driving his mom's, thank God, Grand Prix.

2507
02:58:36,939 --> 02:58:37,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Pontiac Grand Prix.

2508
02:58:37,860 --> 02:58:38,180
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um...

2509
02:58:39,358 --> 02:58:44,469
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the first, yeah, well, I say thank God because the Grand Prixs actually hold up pretty well in a wreck.

2510
02:58:47,376 --> 02:59:12,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, we went on a date, we went to a movie, then we came home, and right after we got out of the theater, it was the first rain of a season, so in the first rain of a season, everybody starts driving like complete idiots, and since it's the first rain, there's a lot of fresh oil on the road, so we're driving, he's driving too fast for conditions, tailgating somebody, and he's looking behind him, talking to the two girls in the rear seat, whereas I'm the only one watching the street.

2511
02:59:13,022 --> 02:59:15,022
[SPEAKER_09]: He's the one driving, but I'm the only one watching the street, so...

2512
02:59:16,224 --> 02:59:18,046
[SPEAKER_09]: Some truck got in an accident up ahead.

2513
02:59:18,487 --> 02:59:20,629
[SPEAKER_09]: They were parked in the middle of the fast lane.

2514
02:59:21,010 --> 02:59:23,212
[SPEAKER_09]: And I look and I say, Oh shit, look out, stop!

2515
02:59:23,412 --> 02:59:27,237
[SPEAKER_09]: And so he turns his head just in time for him to swerve to the right a little bit.

2516
02:59:27,537 --> 02:59:30,801
[SPEAKER_09]: So only half of the car got hit, this truck with an iron bumper.

2517
02:59:31,491 --> 02:59:32,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

2518
02:59:49,223 --> 02:59:49,543
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura

2519
03:00:15,148 --> 03:00:18,512
[SPEAKER_08]: There was one time... Yeah, he said near death, not deaf.

2520
03:00:18,912 --> 03:00:19,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Next time, pay attention.

2521
03:00:24,659 --> 03:00:25,539
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm such a dick.

2522
03:00:25,840 --> 03:00:27,542
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, you had one?

2523
03:00:27,842 --> 03:00:28,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.

2524
03:00:29,103 --> 03:00:33,949
[SPEAKER_02]: There was this one time where I came home and like...

2525
03:00:37,241 --> 03:00:37,742
[SPEAKER_08]: No!

2526
03:00:38,943 --> 03:00:47,572
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there was one time I came home and we were out of Captain Crunch and I thought I was going to die right there.

2527
03:00:53,538 --> 03:00:55,520
[SPEAKER_08]: This one time I had to listen to Christmas Speed.

2528
03:00:56,972 --> 03:01:00,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, uh, other question from AZM Buddy Paul, this is pretty easily answered.

2529
03:01:00,594 --> 03:01:03,256
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the song we use for the Ask Orange Lounge theme music?

2530
03:01:03,276 --> 03:01:05,277
[SPEAKER_08]: We get asked this, I swear to God, every other week.

2531
03:01:06,118 --> 03:01:11,101
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Journey to the Wonderland from Keyboard Mania 2nd Mix by NPB.

2532
03:01:12,702 --> 03:01:16,444
[SPEAKER_08]: 2nd and 3rd if you're a PlayStation 2 player, but 2nd if you're an arcade player.

2533
03:01:16,864 --> 03:01:19,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there was an N3rd mix in the arcade, which makes me sad.

2534
03:01:21,347 --> 03:01:21,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

2535
03:01:22,067 --> 03:01:22,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, uh...

2536
03:01:24,973 --> 03:01:26,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's wrap up the show now.

2537
03:01:26,514 --> 03:01:28,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go around and get folks' final thoughts.

2538
03:01:28,356 --> 03:01:29,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Dark Child, your final thought.

2539
03:01:32,639 --> 03:01:35,762
[SPEAKER_03]: www.milkycookies.com Don't worry, it's not porn.

2540
03:01:35,802 --> 03:01:36,643
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually cool stuff.

2541
03:01:36,903 --> 03:01:38,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I'll take your word for it.

2542
03:01:38,404 --> 03:01:39,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Why I'm going to do that, I don't know.

2543
03:01:39,825 --> 03:01:41,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Brad, your final thought of the night.

2544
03:01:45,710 --> 03:01:46,671
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm on TV, dammit.

2545
03:01:48,132 --> 03:01:49,413
[SPEAKER_17]: Vandalist, your final thought of the evening.

2546
03:01:52,095 --> 03:01:52,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good night.

2547
03:01:53,348 --> 03:01:55,189
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, Bradley, your final thought of the evening.

2548
03:01:57,932 --> 03:01:58,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay.

2549
03:01:59,933 --> 03:02:01,675
[SPEAKER_17]: Zero, your final thought of the evening.

2550
03:02:04,257 --> 03:02:06,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Metal Slug just ain't Metal Slug without the blood.

2551
03:02:08,940 --> 03:02:12,463
[SPEAKER_13]: My final thought of the evening is MORTAL COMBAT!

2552
03:02:15,485 --> 03:02:17,607
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, Loki, your final thought of the evening.

2553
03:02:20,342 --> 03:02:22,825
[SPEAKER_08]: I had too much strawberry soda during this show.

2554
03:02:23,246 --> 03:02:24,608
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I've had a whole six packs.

2555
03:02:24,628 --> 03:02:26,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Does your pee smell like strawberries?

2556
03:02:26,831 --> 03:02:28,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but I'm going to smell it right now!

2557
03:02:32,116 --> 03:02:37,898
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, I'm going to give the final word of the evening, one word to sum up the whole show, and we end on that note tonight.

2558
03:02:37,998 --> 03:02:38,938
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Dark Child.

2559
03:02:39,598 --> 03:02:41,779
[SPEAKER_08]: I give the final word of the night tonight to Vandalus.

2560
03:02:42,439 --> 03:02:43,479
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't have it, Dark Child.

2561
03:02:43,580 --> 03:02:44,040
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't get it.

2562
03:02:44,460 --> 03:02:44,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Goat's seed.

2563
03:02:45,060 --> 03:02:46,120
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no goat's seed.

2564
03:02:46,800 --> 03:02:49,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Vandalus gets the last word of the evening because I know he'll keep it clean.

2565
03:02:50,142 --> 03:02:51,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Vandalus, the final word of the evening tonight?

2566
03:02:54,363 --> 03:02:54,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Apple pie.

2567
03:02:56,639 --> 03:02:59,043
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2568
03:02:59,484 --> 03:03:03,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

2569
03:03:03,792 --> 03:03:05,635
[SPEAKER_05]: We expect you a nice play again.

2570
03:03:06,116 --> 03:03:08,900
[SPEAKER_05]: And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2571
03:03:10,600 --> 03:03:14,362
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to save the relationship by talking about having a baby.

2572
03:03:14,702 --> 03:03:16,623
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, that's going to work.

2573
03:03:17,183 --> 03:03:20,545
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great, great experience recently.

2574
03:03:20,645 --> 03:03:23,887
[SPEAKER_00]: I helped deliver one of my best friend's children.

2575
03:03:23,967 --> 03:03:29,490
[SPEAKER_00]: And, wow, when you witness something like that, you see how powerful women are.

2576
03:03:29,650 --> 03:03:31,571
[SPEAKER_00]: That we bring forth life.

2577
03:03:31,891 --> 03:03:32,331
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's...

2578
03:03:33,932 --> 03:03:34,472
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.

2579
03:03:35,492 --> 03:03:41,194
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just was so amazed by my friend because she was not just a woman.

2580
03:03:41,254 --> 03:03:42,434
[SPEAKER_00]: She was not just a mother.

2581
03:03:42,494 --> 03:03:45,415
[SPEAKER_00]: At that moment, she was creation.

2582
03:03:45,835 --> 03:03:47,315
[SPEAKER_00]: She was life.

2583
03:03:47,775 --> 03:03:48,696
[SPEAKER_00]: She was God.

2584
03:03:49,156 --> 03:03:54,337
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I looked in her eyes, her pussy exploded.

2585
03:04:22,293 --> 03:04:24,674
[SPEAKER_13]: A piece of it hit me in the head!

2586
03:04:32,799 --> 03:04:37,462
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody else was like holding each other and crying and I'm like,

2587
03:04:50,444 --> 03:04:54,625
[SPEAKER_00]: The nurse was running around collecting pieces of her pussy in a basket.

2588
03:05:01,468 --> 03:05:02,828
[SPEAKER_00]: She's just panning for pussy.

2589
03:05:15,272 --> 03:05:17,353
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to sew it back together.

2590
03:05:31,195 --> 03:05:38,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Frank and Pussy It's alive!

2591
03:05:43,694 --> 03:05:45,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for listening and we'll see you next week.
