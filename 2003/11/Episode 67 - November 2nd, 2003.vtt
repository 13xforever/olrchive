Hello everybody and welcome back to orange lounge radio episode number 67 now in progress so happy

14:25.580 --> 14:30.560
Jamie tell me about I'm gonna go sit in the living room so I can show up on cam because otherwise the cams very boring

14:30.560 --> 14:31.900
and if

14:31.900 --> 14:33.780
if you want to

14:33.780 --> 14:35.300
Don't trade

14:35.300 --> 14:42.100
If you want to join us on cam, head on over to our chat room, www.calibomani.com,

14:42.100 --> 14:43.540
click on Orange Lounge, and click on chat.

14:43.540 --> 14:46.800
And in the chat room, by the way, chat room is up on the television screen

14:46.800 --> 14:48.020
so we can all see what you're saying.

14:48.580 --> 14:51.660
So it's interactive when you're in our chat room.

14:53.300 --> 14:58.020
Jamie, first tell us, I want everybody to know about these games that you brought

14:58.020 --> 14:59.600
to the show tonight, because they're pretty cool.

14:59.600 --> 15:03.720
I have them all in the chat room, sorry.

15:03.840 --> 15:07.120
Well, I'll put them up on, the cam's updating, right?

15:07.500 --> 15:08.680
I'll put them up on the.

15:08.680 --> 15:09.700
Yeah, once and once in a while.

15:10.640 --> 15:12.740
Well, you have to explain for those that aren't going to be on the cam.

15:12.740 --> 15:13.360
You're going to have to give the.

15:13.360 --> 15:15.300
Okay. I am an old school gaming freak.

15:15.800 --> 15:16.660
I love old games.

15:17.380 --> 15:18.420
So. Nothing wrong with that.

15:18.560 --> 15:25.500
When Dan and I discovered that Sega was kind enough to release updated versions

15:25.500 --> 15:28.120
of their older games, we hopped right on it and grabbed our three favorites.

15:28.560 --> 15:28.860
Right on.

15:28.860 --> 15:32.860
Of course, one of them was backordered, so we're still waiting for a Phantasy Star collection.

15:32.860 --> 15:33.860
No surprise there.

15:33.860 --> 15:35.860
Well, actually, this is the remake of the first Phantasy Star.

15:35.860 --> 15:38.860
If anyone ever played it on the Master System, you know what I'm talking about.

15:38.860 --> 15:39.860
Right.

15:39.860 --> 15:45.860
But they put out another two games that are probably about my second and third favorite game ever.

15:45.860 --> 15:47.860
And what will be the first game ever?

15:47.860 --> 15:48.860
Guardian Legend.

15:48.860 --> 15:49.860
Amen, sister.

15:49.860 --> 15:51.860
I seriously doubt that's ever going to get a release.

15:51.860 --> 15:57.860
But the first one I'm putting up on cam right now is probably my other favorite game, like, ever.

15:57.860 --> 16:04.020
ever and for those who can't see the cam i'm trying to get to where they'll adjust it's

16:04.020 --> 16:11.620
fantasy zone the game that brought us the opa opa which is this cute little ship with angelings

16:11.620 --> 16:17.220
with feet and when you're on the ground he has little legs and he's super cute see there it is

16:17.220 --> 16:22.820
on the camera fantasy zone um and then the other awesome game it's funny because the way you held

16:22.820 --> 16:32.460
did that be still have Loki on part of the picture now let me see this may be a

16:32.460 --> 16:36.700
little bit better okay so space Harrier being the other game which is some those

16:36.700 --> 16:41.140
that may not recognize space Harrier by name because I didn't at first I kind of

16:41.140 --> 16:44.220
had to I kind of had to get visuals of these games so let me kind of describe

16:44.220 --> 16:50.260
them for you fantasy zone is like this it's like defender but in beautiful

16:50.260 --> 16:56.600
beautiful pastels, and I never thought I'd refer to pastels as a beautiful thing, but

16:56.600 --> 16:58.400
Fantasy Zone really pulls it off.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.240
It's like uber cute in the way it's painted.

17:00.240 --> 17:01.800
It looks like a color by number.

17:01.800 --> 17:09.040
And when you're looking dead on, it looks like it's fully 2D, but they're really actually

17:09.040 --> 17:11.840
flat, self-shaded polygons.

17:11.840 --> 17:15.600
That's kind of the point I wanted to get to about these re-releases, is that they didn't

17:15.600 --> 17:20.840
Now it's not like a Namco museum game or an Atari museum game where they just took the old games

17:20.960 --> 17:25.880
Put them on a CD and emulated it. Basically. No, they took these games

17:26.560 --> 17:32.000
Totally redid them. I'm guessing maybe they took the original code and redid the graphics. Yep completely and

17:32.640 --> 17:39.320
About it. I mean actually I think they're they're fresh from scratch, but they play just like holy fuck. Are they beautiful?

17:39.320 --> 17:41.800
I was impressed. I mean these games I

17:41.800 --> 17:47.040
I wasn't like huge fans of them like Jamie was when they were first out, but I remember

17:47.040 --> 17:48.160
playing Phantasy Zone.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.160
I read it one weekend.

17:49.160 --> 17:55.040
I played it on the Nintendo where it looked like barf because the color palette isn't

17:55.040 --> 17:59.840
the same as it is on a Sega, so it looks all messed up.

17:59.840 --> 18:10.240
The reason why is that the Nintendo was not set up for pastel color where the Master System

18:10.240 --> 18:11.240
was.

18:11.240 --> 18:14.740
So I played them and they looked like barf, but coming back now and playing them again, I'm just like,

18:14.740 --> 18:19.360
oh my god, this is so beautiful. Finally we're using a next generation system

18:19.360 --> 18:22.400
to make our 2D games look even better.

18:22.400 --> 18:28.760
It's so cool. Dear 8-bit companies like Nintendo, anybody that was big in the 8-bit days,

18:28.760 --> 18:29.680
even Konami.

18:29.680 --> 18:34.640
It would be nice to have Super Konami World Collection

18:34.640 --> 18:38.960
in 3D. Seriously, I want you all to take up this project.

18:38.960 --> 18:44.200
Do your old 2D games in 3D like this because they are so cool.

18:44.200 --> 18:48.280
It's just, oh man, especially when you're going to release one of these old

18:48.280 --> 18:52.240
kind of like old school game packs and re-release this like a new thing.

18:52.240 --> 18:55.720
I just, oh it's so beautiful. Words can't express.

18:55.720 --> 19:00.360
They also come with another little neat thing though. If you bought the special edition

19:00.360 --> 19:04.600
of Phantasy Star, which we actually didn't get, it came with a little binder.

19:04.600 --> 19:07.920
And in the binder you would put these

19:07.920 --> 19:09.560
cards

19:09.560 --> 19:15.040
Okay, that are basically just description of the game some of the history of it. I'm putting

19:16.320 --> 19:19.060
Up on the cam. That's still kind of neat though

19:20.840 --> 19:28.000
So, um, but they're also they're bringing out more games the ones that are out right now in the series is

19:30.080 --> 19:32.940
There was of course a fantasy star

19:33.840 --> 19:36.360
Space Harrier, Fantasy Zone, Monaco GP

19:36.360 --> 19:40.560
the Golden Axe, the other one.

19:40.560 --> 19:41.840
Golden Axe is pretty.

19:41.840 --> 19:42.840
Oh my God.

19:42.840 --> 19:48.480
There's a site, actually if you go to the live stream of Community Girl Gamers and just

19:48.480 --> 19:55.420
look for my post, I put a big post there about it with a link to the Japanese site where

19:55.420 --> 20:00.640
you can watch a streaming video of screens from the first five releases.

20:00.640 --> 20:04.460
I'm thinking you need to make that a cross post to the Orange Lounge community.

20:04.460 --> 20:12.960
I'll go look for my old post, but the next ones that are coming out, and actually I didn't

20:12.960 --> 20:20.740
find those out until I looked for the pre-orders on Licksang, but the next one out is Columns,

20:20.740 --> 20:23.980
and then the other one, I don't remember what it is, it's the game that didn't come out

20:23.980 --> 20:24.980
over here.

20:24.980 --> 20:27.980
I'll have to check out all of them.

20:27.980 --> 20:31.100
Oh my God, please tell me they're going to do Alex Kidd.

20:31.100 --> 20:34.100
Wouldn't it be nice?

20:34.100 --> 20:37.100
Yeah, Alex Kidd was a Sega game, wasn't it?

20:37.100 --> 20:38.100
Yes, it was.

20:38.100 --> 20:41.100
What would be really cool is if...

20:41.100 --> 20:42.100
And Shinobi?

20:42.100 --> 20:44.100
Oh, they did Shinobi.

20:44.100 --> 20:45.100
Yeah, but...

20:45.100 --> 20:47.100
Okay, I'm not counting the new Shinobi, the new...

20:47.100 --> 20:49.100
You know what actually I think would be cool?

20:49.100 --> 20:54.100
Is it Michael Jackson Moonwalker?

20:54.100 --> 20:56.100
And Michael Jackson Moonwalker?

20:56.100 --> 20:57.100
Oh, yeah.

20:57.100 --> 20:58.100
What?

20:58.100 --> 20:59.100
What?

20:59.100 --> 21:01.100
Moonwalker was kind of 3D to begin with.

21:01.100 --> 21:02.100
It was one of those cheap...

21:02.100 --> 21:09.100
It was still a 2D game, but it was 3D, like it was like the Ninja Turtles where you can move up and down, but you know what?

21:09.100 --> 21:13.100
Well, this is the last thing, and you know how in Sonic Adventure 2, how they had the bonus?

21:13.100 --> 21:18.100
That was the remake of the Green Hill Zone from the first Sonic game?

21:18.100 --> 21:24.100
Wouldn't it be cool if they took, like, the original Sonic games and did them like that?

21:24.100 --> 21:26.100
Absolutely.

21:26.100 --> 21:42.100
And then of course, this was just kind of brought up, I think this was brought up in the chat room, I think this is where I saw it, but my very favorite old school Sega game of all time, they badly need to do this port 2, Altered Beast.

21:42.100 --> 21:45.100
Rise from your grave.

21:45.100 --> 21:48.220
I cannot wait for them to do Altered Beasts like this.

21:48.620 --> 21:54.260
This is, man, I'm just picturing, like, I'm kind of picturing, I'm going back to Castlevania

21:54.260 --> 21:56.300
because for those who were listening to Vanilla Sky on Monday,

21:56.300 --> 22:00.440
we were talking about the new Castlevania and kind of got into a discussion on, like, you know,

22:00.740 --> 22:05.100
is Castlevania good or what have you because of the 3D-ness of it now.

22:05.400 --> 22:07.120
I'm just thinking, oh my God.

22:07.120 --> 22:11.100
And why would you play it in Japanese without the shitty US voice acting?

22:11.100 --> 22:13.080
Oh my God, that's so much crap.

22:13.080 --> 22:18.640
But I just go back and think, oh my God, what if like Simon's Quest were done like this

22:18.640 --> 22:20.280
Fantasy Zone thing is?

22:20.280 --> 22:21.840
I would have an orgasm.

22:21.840 --> 22:25.640
You know, SEGA's always been really smart with their games.

22:25.640 --> 22:30.440
They've just had, you know, bad advertising and, you know, going up against basically

22:30.440 --> 22:33.960
a major monopoly like, you know, Sony is.

22:33.960 --> 22:38.160
You know, they say that they didn't have, you know, take from their other facilities,

22:38.160 --> 22:43.500
but you can tell they put major money behind the Playstation even though the Saturn to

22:43.500 --> 22:46.040
this day is still a better system.

22:46.040 --> 22:50.000
The Dreamcast to this day still had better games than many of us do.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.320
You will go to your grave a Sega fangirl.

22:53.320 --> 22:59.140
You know I used to be a Nintendo fangirl 100% and now my whole support of Nintendo comes

22:59.140 --> 23:02.040
just because Sega is supporting them.

23:02.040 --> 23:08.360
Isn't it so weird now to fire up a game like F-Zero, and you see on the first screen Sega

23:08.360 --> 23:09.360
Nintendo.

23:09.360 --> 23:15.320
It's like, wow, ten years ago you're picturing those ads in your mind, Sega does what Nintendo

23:15.320 --> 23:16.320
does.

23:16.320 --> 23:17.320
Well, you know what?

23:17.320 --> 23:23.760
I remember on one of my tapes, one of my old tapes off Japanese TV, watching the monkeys,

23:23.760 --> 23:28.400
these two little monkeys playing TV, and one of them was playing a Saturn, playing Burning

23:28.400 --> 23:33.640
Rangers on the Saturn if this dates this for you and the other one was playing like

23:34.200 --> 23:40.560
Some other game on like an older crappy game on the PlayStation and the PlayStation monkey went to go play the Saturn

23:40.560 --> 23:44.880
I have to address something that came up in the chat room. We have some new chatters tonight

23:44.880 --> 23:47.840
So hello to all our new folks. We love seeing some new faces in our chair room

23:47.840 --> 23:52.180
I love a guy named Bargo who says a bunch of numbers is a little bit

23:52.180 --> 23:57.460
disgusted by the thought of me having an orgasm over a game. You know what? There is nothing

23:57.460 --> 24:01.940
better than an orgasm. You name me one thing in this world that's better than an orgasm.

24:01.940 --> 24:06.180
Two orgasms! Two orgasms! Thank you, Loki!

24:06.180 --> 24:11.780
Really good ice cream. Maybe if you're a woman, but...

24:11.780 --> 24:19.140
If I was sitting between the best orgasm ever and a bowl of Chocolate Decadence Blue Bell

24:19.140 --> 24:31.720
ice cream. Chocolate orgasm. Ooh. And this may be TMI. Is that a cold stone? Actually

24:31.720 --> 24:39.560
the best best thing ever is the bowl of ice cream you eat after an orgasm. Is to go out,

24:39.560 --> 24:45.760
fuck a bunch, and then eat a bowl of ice cream. For some it's the cigarettes, for some it's

24:45.760 --> 24:51.240
the ice cream. Next time I'm going to go into Cold Stone, I'm going to be all, yeah, could

24:51.240 --> 24:59.520
I get the, I'd like to get the vanilla cream with the orgasm mix in.

24:59.520 --> 25:06.400
You know what we need to do, we need to sit and create, call it the orange lounge orgasm

25:06.400 --> 25:11.480
at Cold Stone. And keep, and like, put the right flavors in it.

25:11.480 --> 25:12.480
Oh, like write it in.

25:12.480 --> 25:14.480
I don't have those anymore. You can't do it.

25:14.480 --> 25:16.480
I was going to put mine in.

25:16.480 --> 25:20.480
I used to have my cherry cheesecake flavor.

25:20.480 --> 25:23.480
That I just called the dark soccer club.

25:23.480 --> 25:24.480
How original.

25:24.480 --> 25:35.480
It was graham cracker, brownie, cheesecake, and cherry pie filling.

25:35.480 --> 25:38.480
It was so good and so bad for me.

25:38.480 --> 25:39.480
I want ice cream now.

25:39.480 --> 25:41.480
God damn it, I want ice cream!

25:41.480 --> 25:47.480
As good as that sounds, Jamie, orgasms are better.

25:47.480 --> 25:51.480
Anyway, I think we got off on a little bit of a tangent there.

25:51.480 --> 25:52.480
Sorry, kids.

25:52.480 --> 25:53.480
That's what we do here on Orange Island.

25:53.480 --> 25:54.480
Welcome to the Fantasy Zone.

25:54.480 --> 25:56.480
Get ready.

25:56.480 --> 25:58.480
I was so happy because it's in there.

25:58.480 --> 25:59.480
Does it actually have voice acting?

25:59.480 --> 26:00.480
Well, yeah.

26:00.480 --> 26:02.480
It's like, okay, this is what happened.

26:02.480 --> 26:05.480
I wish we could play it for the chat room, but we really can't.

26:05.480 --> 26:13.080
When you start off the game, it doesn't say welcome to the fantasy zone, get ready, at

26:13.080 --> 26:19.680
least the first time you did it, it's like, get ready, Harrier, or something like that.

26:19.680 --> 26:22.520
I bet you were pissed when you heard that.

26:22.520 --> 26:28.800
Oh, I was, and then four games later, watching Dan play it the other night, it finally said

26:28.800 --> 26:29.800
it.

26:29.800 --> 26:36.480
I remember when I first ever like saw your post back on DDR Freak I remember

26:36.480 --> 26:39.600
that was your signature welcome to the fantasy zone get ready and I always

26:39.600 --> 26:45.880
thought it was actually from fantasy zone common misconception I'm sure is

26:45.880 --> 26:51.880
set in the same universe as fantasy zone I think a lot of people don't realize

26:51.880 --> 26:54.960
that yeah I know you've mentioned that to me before watch the if you look at

26:54.960 --> 26:59.000
the original games your fantasy zone has the big plaid floors and everything and

26:59.000 --> 27:05.000
And then you have the Checkered Ground, and then the Checkered Ground is in Space Harrier, the originals.

27:05.000 --> 27:09.000
And it's set in the same universe, although they made it completely different for these two.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
They look completely different.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
So, here's my final thought on the whole 8-bit games being redone.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
Guardian Legend remake, Guardian Legend remake.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
Deer, Broderbund, and who else put that game out?

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
I don't remember.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Broderbund was the publisher of it.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Please do a Guardian Legend remake.

27:26.000 --> 27:31.280
make. Oh my god, I would never leave the house, ever. It's done. It would be more addicting

27:31.280 --> 27:32.280
than-

27:32.280 --> 27:35.360
You know, there was, there wasn't a game that came out-

27:35.360 --> 27:36.360
Guardian Legend Online.

27:36.360 --> 27:37.360
Oh my god.

27:37.360 --> 27:41.520
No, I don't know. Guardian Legend is not a game to be played online. Guardian Legend

27:41.520 --> 27:44.000
is a masturbatory game. It's a solo experience.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.920
Yeah, it's, you know what? They need to freakin' do-

27:47.920 --> 27:48.920
It's a solo orgasm.

27:48.920 --> 27:53.800
You know what? It was the original, it was the original survival horror game.

27:53.800 --> 27:55.960
I don't know if I'd call it a horror game.

27:55.960 --> 28:00.560
Well, okay, but it was the original survival game, if you think about it.

28:00.560 --> 28:06.280
Because here you are, on this planet, by yourself, you know, this is before Samus ever did her

28:06.280 --> 28:10.960
deal, I think, because there was the, what do you call it, Guardia, that came out before

28:10.960 --> 28:11.960
that on the MSX.

28:11.960 --> 28:12.960
Yeah, okay.

28:12.960 --> 28:13.960
I mean, if you want to get technical with that.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.960
Didn't the MSX come out before the Famicom?

28:15.960 --> 28:16.960
It did.

28:16.960 --> 28:17.960
Okay.

28:17.960 --> 28:18.960
But yeah, I think it was on the MSX.

28:18.960 --> 28:26.280
But anyway, you know, you're there and you can turn into a ship, but you have to go find

28:26.280 --> 28:27.280
weapons.

28:27.280 --> 28:30.600
I mean, she was doing it before Snake ever did his thing.

28:30.600 --> 28:32.240
It's the same thing too.

28:32.240 --> 28:35.840
It's tactical, survival, espionage, horror shooting game.

28:35.840 --> 28:41.320
I always, I don't know if I'd go as far to say that it was this new genre of game that

28:41.320 --> 28:48.640
was fabulous, but what it did is it took two genres of existing games like Zelda and Gradius

28:48.640 --> 28:54.280
to kind of name two more like life force maybe but took these two days and brought them together

28:54.280 --> 28:56.400
so beautifully.

28:56.400 --> 29:01.320
It's just like going to a wedding and crying at the beautiful union of these two things.

29:01.320 --> 29:04.040
And it had the little thingies from Adventure of Lolo.

29:04.040 --> 29:05.040
What?

29:05.040 --> 29:08.460
The blue thingies from Adventure of Lolo.

29:08.460 --> 29:09.460
It did.

29:09.460 --> 29:10.460
They've had the shots.

29:10.460 --> 29:15.180
I don't think they were, I think they were supposed to be, they're related to the blue

29:15.180 --> 29:22.700
things from Zexes Z-E-Y-X-Z that game Zexes? Yeah I think it's related to those

29:22.700 --> 29:27.420
blue guys not the Lolo guy I think Lolo is a different blue guy. So I was like hey the guys

29:27.420 --> 29:32.740
from adventure from adventure Lolo left they're boycotting. It was I you know it

29:32.740 --> 29:36.740
had really good music in it too and I also knew the trick where you could walk

29:36.740 --> 29:41.900
through the the wall the divider walls in the center like if you held your

29:41.900 --> 29:45.800
controller at an angle and you could walk through the wall and get to the

29:45.800 --> 29:51.680
other side. Epic games are great. And you know the other neat controller trick was

29:51.680 --> 29:57.360
the one for Mega Man 3. I submitted the thing to Nintendo Power

29:57.360 --> 30:03.020
way back when because I was the first person on the world that found this little trick. You know

30:03.020 --> 30:07.460
everyone knew about the double jump in Mega Man 3 where you hold down your

30:07.460 --> 30:10.520
left and right and I think A button or something like that on the second

30:10.520 --> 30:13.760
controller and you can I put it on the floor and sit in a chair and hold it with

30:13.760 --> 30:19.280
my feet but if you fall down a hole and then you let go and then hit it again

30:19.280 --> 30:23.120
you'll hear the die noise and then you can jump out of the hole and you have no

30:23.120 --> 30:29.080
life really and you can use the only way that you can shoot anything is to use

30:29.080 --> 30:35.440
your special weapons because your shot is also your life but if you hit a power

30:35.440 --> 30:39.640
up you know a life refill then you have to do the trick again but it's really

30:39.640 --> 30:45.880
convenient when you're going against a boss and they can't kill you because you're already

30:45.880 --> 30:52.440
dead. So that's, you know, I'm going off on a tangent right now.

30:52.440 --> 30:56.520
Hooray for aggression. That's all right. All right, we need a topic

30:56.520 --> 31:02.480
change. So you're going to be gone the next two weeks. So what's going on? For those that

31:02.480 --> 31:05.800
are just joining us tonight, because I know we have some new folks, what's going on? Why

31:05.800 --> 31:07.000
are you going to be leaving us the next couple of weeks?

31:07.000 --> 31:08.260
I'm going to see my family.

31:08.260 --> 31:11.220
The fifth is my mama's birthday.

31:11.220 --> 31:12.820
I'm very pissed off that this is going

31:12.820 --> 31:13.980
to go into the Vikings of the week

31:13.980 --> 31:16.180
because I can't buy my mom her Alan Jackson tickets

31:16.180 --> 31:18.300
because I can't afford them.

31:18.300 --> 31:22.180
Which I'm really not that upset about me missing Alan Jackson,

31:22.180 --> 31:24.300
but mom is really good.

31:24.300 --> 31:27.660
And unless the credit card I signed up for arrives,

31:27.660 --> 31:28.780
I can't get her tickets.

31:32.260 --> 31:34.180
So I'm going to take her out to eat.

31:34.180 --> 31:39.720
I'm going to try to do something nice, but the general itinerary is spending time

31:39.720 --> 31:45.280
with my family, spending time with my mama-san and papa-san, who are really,

31:45.280 --> 31:48.660
really good friends of mine who took care of me when I needed some place to stay.

31:49.300 --> 31:53.980
Going to my college and getting my transcripts, because you know technically I'm still enrolled

31:53.980 --> 31:55.420
at the University of South Alabama.

31:55.420 --> 31:58.140
Technically, I'm still enrolled at a school in California, too.

31:58.340 --> 31:58.700
Mm-hmm.

31:59.620 --> 32:04.500
I'm going to have to get a SARS mask to go visit my mom's house

32:04.500 --> 32:08.300
because she and her husband both smoke and also have a dog.

32:09.300 --> 32:10.740
What am I super allergic to?

32:11.300 --> 32:12.820
Cigarette-smoking dog.

32:13.480 --> 32:17.900
Didn't you, oh, I don't, I'm a fan of Tangerine.

32:18.080 --> 32:19.240
Well, yeah, but.

32:19.240 --> 32:21.440
But it was the cigars because I wasn't allergic to them.

32:22.860 --> 32:24.060
But I think it's different.

32:24.060 --> 32:26.300
Once you quit, like, it can.

32:26.300 --> 32:28.300
Well, it's really stupid to me because I had asthma.

32:28.480 --> 32:29.860
It can really affect you.

32:30.060 --> 32:33.820
Honestly, and I know that probably some people who are listening smoke,

32:33.820 --> 32:37.080
I know that some people do every so often.

32:37.880 --> 32:42.480
But I still think that it's probably the most retarded thing anyone can do to themselves.

32:42.860 --> 32:47.360
That, and it's also pretty, and forgive me for saying so, this is how I feel about it.

32:47.560 --> 32:50.400
It's also pretty inconsiderate of other people because you're poisoning their air.

32:51.420 --> 32:52.160
If you think about it.

32:52.380 --> 32:53.760
They have to breathe the smoke.

32:53.760 --> 33:00.680
And oh my God, I went to the casino and I thought I was going to die.

33:00.680 --> 33:01.680
You went to the casino?

33:01.680 --> 33:07.320
I went to Thunder Valley yesterday with Iguana Girl and Islander.

33:07.320 --> 33:09.920
You know what's weird about that casino?

33:09.920 --> 33:10.920
No arcade.

33:10.920 --> 33:11.920
Yeah.

33:11.920 --> 33:13.200
I'm such a dork.

33:13.200 --> 33:16.440
The first time the casino opened up, I'm like, oh, maybe there will be a cool DDR machine

33:16.440 --> 33:19.960
because that's just what an addict I am.

33:19.960 --> 33:21.280
No arcade to be found anywhere.

33:21.280 --> 33:23.720
Where do the kids go when mommy and daddy go to gambling?

33:23.720 --> 33:25.600
I know that happens a lot.

33:25.600 --> 33:30.200
I think that they lock them in the trunk.

33:30.200 --> 33:33.200
The whole reason we went was to play bingo.

33:33.200 --> 33:34.880
They have bingo there?

33:34.880 --> 33:35.880
They have bingo.

33:35.880 --> 33:36.880
It's pretty fun.

33:36.880 --> 33:37.880
When?

33:37.880 --> 33:38.880
They do it once an hour.

33:38.880 --> 33:41.880
It's basically 45-50 minutes of bingo.

33:41.880 --> 33:43.880
Holy shit.

33:43.880 --> 33:45.760
You can do the electronic or you can do the paper play.

33:45.760 --> 33:48.880
In the paper play, you basically get twice as many cards.

33:48.880 --> 33:52.240
Is there a separate room for bingo or something?

33:52.240 --> 33:53.360
Like a convention room.

33:53.360 --> 33:55.560
I have never seen the bingo room.

33:55.820 --> 33:57.480
It says bingo and big old letters inside.

33:57.480 --> 33:59.160
Like when you go in the door and head off to the right

33:59.160 --> 34:03.440
and around past the snack area, there's the bingo room.

34:04.100 --> 34:11.140
But it's $12 for the paper play and the lightning progressive round and the validation.

34:11.580 --> 34:12.600
But it's pretty fun.

34:12.600 --> 34:14.640
And, you know, I was really close to a blackout.

34:14.720 --> 34:16.000
I mean, I was like three away.

34:16.480 --> 34:16.800
Right.

34:17.000 --> 34:17.440
So.

34:19.040 --> 34:19.980
Did anybody win anything?

34:20.060 --> 34:21.800
Do one of you get three folks on the floor?

34:21.800 --> 34:22.180
Oh, bummer.

34:22.180 --> 34:29.800
But I, we went back to play on the slot machines trying to earn money for the next game.

34:30.420 --> 34:34.820
And I just, when we sat down in front of a machine, put a dollar in it and got 15.50 back.

34:35.240 --> 34:39.360
It's one of those, you know, where you can play up to 15 lines or nine lines or something.

34:39.360 --> 34:45.240
And I got, I only played one line, get this, I played one line, the middle line,

34:45.700 --> 34:51.620
and it was the one that's all like, like the poker faces, like 10 and up.

34:51.620 --> 34:53.960
And I got all 10s across.

34:55.300 --> 34:59.100
So I actually won like 17 off of it that I played a couple more rounds.

34:59.100 --> 35:02.540
My future strategy for casinos, I've learned from Lanky Style,

35:02.540 --> 35:06.240
one of the folks you hear on Vanilla Sky, video poker is where it's at.

35:06.240 --> 35:09.980
Honestly, when I was in Reno last time, the only place I made money was video poker.

35:09.980 --> 35:11.180
And that is all I'm ever going to play.

35:11.180 --> 35:12.520
I lost all my video poker skills.

35:12.520 --> 35:13.440
I don't know what happened.

35:13.440 --> 35:14.680
That is all I'm ever going to play in the future.

35:14.680 --> 35:17.140
When I was in Vegas for the ZDF Freak Moderators trip,

35:17.140 --> 35:20.040
I was at the end of my money when we were leaving.

35:20.040 --> 35:25.280
I had fifty cents in my pocket and I turned it into ten dollars

35:25.280 --> 35:28.960
because I needed a cap there.

35:28.960 --> 35:32.920
I'm looking at the chat room some of the comments on bingo we have some folks

35:32.920 --> 35:34.000
that say they

35:34.000 --> 35:39.880
hate bingo, you get complimentary prune juice, my grandma plays bingo with shuffleboard

35:39.880 --> 35:43.240
was it a lot of old people there playing bingo?

35:43.240 --> 35:46.280
There were old people there but there were a lot of young people too.

35:46.280 --> 35:49.480
I'm noticing bingo seems to be like a younger and younger thing because

35:49.480 --> 35:54.400
We had a girl in one of my classes where I work and we asked everybody, why are you hired

35:54.400 --> 35:58.440
at work and why did you decide to come to this place and work?

35:58.440 --> 36:03.480
One of the girls actually said, I have to fund my bingo addiction.

36:03.480 --> 36:05.680
She had a daughter in her purse.

36:05.680 --> 36:10.960
Not like a son and daughter, but like a bingo daughter, a dauber, not a daughter, a dauber.

36:10.960 --> 36:14.000
She had a dauber in her purse with her, always.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.640
You think we're obsessed on this show?

36:15.640 --> 36:20.040
Well, the thing is, is that they actually have, you know, they've got site machines, but they also have like

36:20.040 --> 36:23.360
soda fountain machines, and coffee,

36:23.360 --> 36:26.760
and tea, and I made a latte

36:26.760 --> 36:31.520
there for myself. I think I played bingo and had a latte with whipped cream.

36:31.520 --> 36:34.560
Well, they have a Starbucks in the casino. You know what they have in the casino?

36:34.560 --> 36:37.920
A fatburger. I can't either. I know, but it's...

36:37.920 --> 36:41.120
Although I did hear they have turkey burgers, so I'll have to go there for a turkey burger.

36:41.120 --> 36:45.600
Oh my god, I ate a pork cutlet. It made me sick, too.

36:45.600 --> 36:47.160
Did you go to the buffet there?

36:47.160 --> 36:48.920
No, I ate it at my friend's house.

36:48.920 --> 36:52.200
We wanted to go to Fresh Choice, so we could come back.

36:52.200 --> 36:54.440
When you come back from Alabama, we'll go play bingo,

36:54.440 --> 36:56.020
and we'll go late so we can go to the buffet,

36:56.020 --> 36:58.360
because the buffet is so good.

36:58.360 --> 37:01.080
The thing is, we played the five and seven game.

37:01.080 --> 37:03.040
And the thing is, though, is that you

37:03.040 --> 37:06.680
don't get a second chance on the five and seven game.

37:06.680 --> 37:09.040
So we need to go play the earlier games

37:09.040 --> 37:09.880
if we're going to go.

37:09.880 --> 37:10.440
Interesting.

37:10.440 --> 37:14.280
So you can get a second chance to win, because I was close.

37:14.280 --> 37:17.160
Is it going 24 hours a day?

37:17.160 --> 37:17.800
No, I don't think so.

37:17.800 --> 37:18.520
Oh, well shit.

37:18.520 --> 37:21.440
Because the buffet is like, I know

37:21.440 --> 37:23.560
this is really interesting to all our listeners out of town,

37:23.560 --> 37:24.920
but just bear with us.

37:24.920 --> 37:30.200
The buffet is only like $6 after 11 o'clock at night.

37:30.200 --> 37:31.520
Holy crap, we should go.

37:31.520 --> 37:32.560
You have to go late.

37:32.560 --> 37:38.080
But man, if you don't eat all day and then go, oh.

37:38.080 --> 37:40.040
What's it like during the day?

37:40.040 --> 37:41.120
Pricey?

37:41.120 --> 37:42.200
Like $15.

37:42.200 --> 37:43.200
That's still not bad.

37:43.200 --> 37:47.480
Not bad, but considering everything you get, not bad.

37:47.480 --> 37:54.240
The one I went to at the, I wouldn't say the Beaux-Rivage, but that's one in Biloxi where

37:54.240 --> 38:00.200
my friend works, but it was the Rio Casino.

38:00.200 --> 38:06.560
They have a seafood buffet, it was like 30 bucks, but you get like Maine lobster on the

38:06.560 --> 38:10.840
buffet.

38:10.840 --> 38:15.040
I was like king crab, Alaskan snow crab, and everything.

38:15.040 --> 38:17.040
I was like, oh, fish.

38:17.040 --> 38:17.540
OK.

38:17.540 --> 38:19.840
But that's, 15's not bad compared.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.160
Well, we'll have to go and get back.

38:21.160 --> 38:22.360
But have fun in Alabama.

38:22.360 --> 38:24.200
I don't know what we're going to do on the show

38:24.200 --> 38:25.960
without you while you're gone.

38:25.960 --> 38:28.080
Because Loki and I, the last time

38:28.080 --> 38:31.960
we did a show by ourselves, it was very interesting.

38:31.960 --> 38:35.240
Yeah, that was the first time Loki made super bacon on the air.

38:35.240 --> 38:39.560
I'm hoping we have a temporary fill-in somehow.

38:39.560 --> 38:40.560
Oh, we'll get somebody.

38:40.560 --> 38:46.520
to find a woman because we need the female perspective on the show you know

38:46.520 --> 38:51.680
what we need to get yeah we need to make melody come down now we'll figure

38:51.680 --> 38:58.560
something out we need to get pixie too I haven't yet to meet her I've heard good

38:58.560 --> 39:03.040
things about her but I have to meet Oh pixie dust I'm thinking I'm thinking of

39:03.040 --> 39:09.840
the other pixie there's two pixies and then I'll have to like call you know

39:09.840 --> 39:14.920
I'll just we'll just get all the women here in your absence. We'll get Irene and melody and Janae and

39:16.860 --> 39:22.560
Violent hyper girl, we'll just get them all here one night, and you know we'll have a we'll have a girls night on orange lounge

39:26.460 --> 39:30.260
And I'll just be sitting in the corner making fun of everyone else

39:33.900 --> 39:35.900
We'll see

39:36.140 --> 39:38.140
We'll see

39:38.140 --> 39:44.540
Well, so who knows what's gonna happen when when you're gone, but we'll still be doing shows you're gonna miss episode 69

39:44.540 --> 39:46.540
I cry that's okay

39:46.780 --> 39:52.500
But some more announcements about what's coming up to the station. So big changes coming in November all through the month, really?

39:53.340 --> 39:57.620
So we'll talk about that in a little while. Oh my god, my voice still isn't all the way back

39:58.140 --> 40:00.140
Well, I was just about to go into

40:03.260 --> 40:05.940
I was just about to go into how was your week? How was your day?

40:05.940 --> 40:09.840
So, I'll let you continue your bitching by asking you, how was your week?

40:09.840 --> 40:10.280
How was your day?

40:10.280 --> 40:16.680
I didn't have a voice most of the week, and as everyone can tell, it's barely, barely back.

40:17.460 --> 40:23.400
I felt lots better, you know, progressively throughout the day.

40:23.400 --> 40:26.020
The cough is, I guess, as everyone can tell, mostly cleared up,

40:26.400 --> 40:28.460
although I still need the codeine at night.

40:29.220 --> 40:30.360
I'm on happy drugs.

40:30.360 --> 40:32.000
I took the last of my antibiotics today.

40:32.340 --> 40:32.780
Whee!

40:32.780 --> 40:38.360
I didn't touch my bimani except to lend it out to people while I'm out of town.

40:40.060 --> 40:40.460
And.

40:40.460 --> 40:42.560
Shit, I should have gotten my ignition pad back.

40:42.680 --> 40:43.020
Oh well.

40:43.520 --> 40:44.120
That's all right.

40:44.120 --> 40:46.720
He's going to have the super ones done soon enough.

40:47.060 --> 40:53.120
Okay. Yeah, I haven't been able to play DDR while my asthma has been so bad.

40:53.440 --> 40:58.480
But I'm going to play an Alabama and I'm going to play the BeatMania 6 Mix Machine

40:59.480 --> 41:00.800
if they still have it in the middle of the wall.

41:00.800 --> 41:04.880
I'm looking forward to that.

41:06.180 --> 41:08.040
Really, I didn't do a lot, much of anything.

41:09.080 --> 41:10.380
Dan and I went out a bunch.

41:10.840 --> 41:18.880
We, on Halloween, my work, every department decorated for a contest.

41:19.160 --> 41:28.780
And like there's this one group that's in another building at the, at the, I just told Bob where it is.

41:28.780 --> 41:34.880
But there's another building back there that they did, Studio 100M.

41:35.920 --> 41:37.480
So they made it up like a dance club.

41:38.220 --> 41:42.480
And it was really nice, but like one of the rooms upstairs was the super VIP room.

41:42.840 --> 41:49.240
And they had like baking powder out on a mirror with a laser blade to the liquid cane.

41:50.300 --> 41:53.200
And everyone was dressed up all 70s and everything.

41:53.200 --> 41:54.720
Oh, that's a lovely picture.

41:54.720 --> 41:59.380
One of the other places was they did it up like the Old West.

41:59.380 --> 42:00.680
It was really nice the way they did it.

42:00.680 --> 42:03.020
You know, had a bum in the jail and everything.

42:03.540 --> 42:06.300
And another one was the haunted pirate ship.

42:07.220 --> 42:08.560
And one was the 60s.

42:08.880 --> 42:10.480
They did the 60s theme.

42:10.640 --> 42:16.120
And you know they handed out the snacks, brownies, and this stuff called bong water.

42:16.940 --> 42:17.500
Oh, how nice.

42:17.500 --> 42:19.500
It's a drink that these people are making in Arizona,

42:19.500 --> 42:21.880
and they're going to be marketing it here now.

42:21.880 --> 42:27.420
Coming up in the next few months or so, and I tried it and it's really good.

42:27.420 --> 42:31.060
It's not really carbonated, but more like a flavored water beverage.

42:31.060 --> 42:33.060
It's really good.

42:33.060 --> 42:38.220
Now, customer service was the best, and we won best, of course.

42:38.220 --> 42:39.220
Did you?

42:39.220 --> 42:47.220
We were haven and heck, and I decided that I was going to be in hell, so I wear my evil

42:47.220 --> 42:48.220
boots.

42:48.220 --> 42:49.220
Where you belong.

42:49.220 --> 42:57.820
I wear my evil boots that I wear at Anima Expo for my Mad Hatter costume, the ones that

42:57.820 --> 43:01.240
make me instantly fight it just taller.

43:01.240 --> 43:08.220
Black pinstripe pants, this black corporate looking top, and my black wings.

43:08.220 --> 43:15.140
I had lots of really gothic makeup and carried my whip with me, and I was a modern day angel

43:15.140 --> 43:16.140
of death.

43:16.140 --> 43:22.540
And all the chemicals were lined in black, and the walls were black and red, and we had

43:22.540 --> 43:26.300
a guillotine, and we had the grim reaper hanging out in the corner.

43:26.300 --> 43:27.300
Off with their heads.

43:27.300 --> 43:28.300
Fire.

43:28.300 --> 43:29.300
Did you have any watermelons?

43:29.300 --> 43:32.180
We had these fakes coming into the major walkways, and they had fire erasing from them.

43:32.180 --> 43:34.380
We had little torches, fake fire everywhere.

43:34.380 --> 43:35.380
Cool.

43:35.380 --> 43:37.380
And we had the lights off.

43:37.380 --> 43:38.380
Fire's great.

43:38.380 --> 43:41.060
So it was all red and fiery and everything.

43:41.060 --> 43:45.140
I totally missed Halloween in my work, but I'll get into that later.

43:45.140 --> 43:52.640
But one of the girls at my work, her costume was the best she did, the girl from The Ring,

43:52.640 --> 43:53.640
the TV girl.

43:53.640 --> 43:54.640
Cool.

43:54.640 --> 43:59.080
Keep in mind, I haven't seen The Ring, but I knew her costume.

43:59.080 --> 44:01.320
She won scariest costume, and it was perfect.

44:01.320 --> 44:02.320
It was absolutely perfect.

44:02.320 --> 44:06.720
The Ring, for a contemporary horror movie, it's really, really good.

44:06.720 --> 44:08.600
I need to watch Ringo.

44:08.600 --> 44:13.800
I have actually heard that some people, even folks that usually prefer Javanese cinema,

44:13.800 --> 44:17.080
say the ring is better but i've heard mixed well i've heard that the first

44:17.080 --> 44:20.520
one's more the japanese ones more suspense and the american ones more

44:20.520 --> 44:21.560
horror

44:21.560 --> 44:26.160
yeah i could see that and i would go for the suspense over the other

44:26.160 --> 44:29.280
and i watched movie trailers today

44:29.280 --> 44:33.800
preview for a movie i have to see what's that alien vs predator

44:33.800 --> 44:39.460
oh give me give me a break that looks like crap no i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm

44:39.460 --> 44:43.460
I'm going to see it because I've read some of the comics, I love the game.

44:43.460 --> 44:46.460
Alien vs. Predator needs to stay a video game.

44:46.460 --> 44:48.460
I know it's nothing like the comics.

44:48.460 --> 44:56.460
I have a question. I have a question that will determine if this movie will suck or not.

44:56.460 --> 44:58.460
Is Sigourney Weaver in it?

44:58.460 --> 44:59.460
No.

44:59.460 --> 45:00.460
Fuck this movie.

45:00.460 --> 45:01.460
But I'm still going to see it.

45:01.460 --> 45:06.460
I'm still going to see it just because I want to see all the action that ensues.

45:06.460 --> 45:07.460
I don't care about the story.

45:07.460 --> 45:10.980
I'm there to see predators and aliens beating each other up.

45:10.980 --> 45:14.340
This movie ruins the continuity of all the sequels.

45:14.340 --> 45:18.620
Seriously, it makes no sense with this movie being there.

45:18.620 --> 45:19.620
It makes no sense.

45:19.620 --> 45:20.620
It's just retarded.

45:20.620 --> 45:25.020
I would rather see Freddy vs Jason ten more times.

45:25.020 --> 45:32.340
I'd rather go see The House of the Dead than this movie.

45:32.340 --> 45:36.680
The story is utter shit, but I think the action is going to be good.

45:36.680 --> 45:42.720
And I want to see the decapitations and shootings and blood and crap.

45:42.720 --> 45:43.880
I want to see all...

45:43.880 --> 45:44.880
I'm going...

45:44.880 --> 45:45.880
I want to see the production.

45:45.880 --> 45:46.880
Alright, fair enough.

45:46.880 --> 45:47.880
So you're in it for the violence.

45:47.880 --> 45:48.880
I'm in it for the violence.

45:48.880 --> 45:49.880
Alright, fair enough.

45:49.880 --> 45:50.880
That I can...

45:50.880 --> 45:51.880
That for me is going to be a gore test.

45:51.880 --> 45:52.880
The cheesy gore, I can deal with that as a reason.

45:52.880 --> 45:53.880
I don't...

45:53.880 --> 45:54.880
The story is shit.

45:54.880 --> 45:56.880
However, let's see Alien vs. Predator vs. Ash.

45:56.880 --> 45:57.880
How about it?

45:57.880 --> 45:58.880
Huh?

45:58.880 --> 45:59.880
How about it?

45:59.880 --> 46:00.880
I'll just bring out the boomstick.

46:00.880 --> 46:05.720
The question from Chat Room Jamie, is the featurette on the web somewhere?

46:05.720 --> 46:12.920
If you go to apple.com slash trailers, it's actually in, I think the, either,

46:13.880 --> 46:17.660
I think there's four columns and it's in the, the second one.

46:18.800 --> 46:21.440
Cool. So what other movie trailers did you watch?

46:21.440 --> 46:23.260
I watched one for Resident Evil Apocalypse.

46:23.500 --> 46:24.160
That was funny.

46:24.440 --> 46:25.260
Is that the sequel?

46:25.560 --> 46:29.840
Yeah. It's a commercial for the stuff called Regenerate.

46:30.960 --> 46:35.160
And this woman, and you can tell it's obviously touched up, a young woman,

46:35.160 --> 46:37.360
but she's got it looking all wrinkled and everything.

46:37.760 --> 46:41.460
And it's like, it looks like, for the people who saw Resident Evil,

46:41.460 --> 46:46.100
it looks like the T-Virus thing that they dropped at the beginning.

46:46.500 --> 46:48.900
It's like using T-cell technology.

46:49.480 --> 46:52.720
You know, I wasn't a huge fan of the Resident Evil movie.

46:52.720 --> 46:55.520
I mean, there just aren't a lot of good video game movies.

46:55.520 --> 46:58.700
I know a lot of the hardcore date gamers really did like the movie.

46:58.700 --> 47:03.880
I'm kind of in a minority there, but maybe I'll check out the sequel when it's on video.

47:03.880 --> 47:07.880
You need to watch the trailer, though, because it is hilarious.

47:07.880 --> 47:19.880
I'm sorry, the best movie, you know, game movie adaptions have to be, without a doubt, Street Fighter and Double Dragon. They rocked like nothing else.

47:19.880 --> 47:22.880
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

47:22.880 --> 47:25.880
No, I thought you were going to see Super Mario Brothers.

47:25.880 --> 47:27.880
Has there been a really, really good one?

47:27.880 --> 47:29.880
Well...

47:29.880 --> 47:30.880
Mortal Kombat was decent.

47:30.880 --> 47:31.880
Mortal Kombat was good.

47:31.880 --> 47:32.920
when I was at that age.

47:33.920 --> 47:38.240
You know what I thought would have, was better than,

47:38.240 --> 47:39.840
and actually it's another Van Damme movie,

47:39.840 --> 47:41.380
but I thought it was better than the Street Fighter movie

47:41.380 --> 47:43.740
that they did, because it seemed like it fit more in it.

47:44.020 --> 47:45.080
What was it called, The Quest?

47:46.380 --> 47:48.340
Yeah, there was a Van Damme movie called The Quest.

47:48.480 --> 47:50.740
That made me think of the Street Fighter flick,

47:50.900 --> 47:52.840
what Street Fighter should have been.

47:52.840 --> 47:55.020
I had that whole impression when I saw it, and I went and saw

47:55.020 --> 47:56.740
that one in the theater because it was a dollar movie.

47:56.980 --> 47:59.560
The whole reason I was there is because I went there

47:59.560 --> 48:01.120
to play one of my favorite games ever,

48:01.120 --> 48:09.120
Starblade because they had the one in the big crane set up when you paid 75 cents and you were in this full 3D motion.

48:09.120 --> 48:10.120
Cool.

48:10.120 --> 48:15.120
And they told me that I had to see a movie to keep playing the game so I went and saw that.

48:15.120 --> 48:20.120
And then I went and saw that because I was like the only person who could.

48:22.120 --> 48:23.120
The Last Starfighter.

48:25.120 --> 48:26.120
Wasn't that, that was the game?

48:26.120 --> 48:27.120
The game came out after the movie.

48:27.120 --> 48:28.120
The game came out after the movie.

48:28.120 --> 48:29.120
The game came out after the movie.

48:29.120 --> 48:32.120
Whatever, it still ties together.

48:32.120 --> 48:34.120
Last time I thought it was a good movie.

48:34.120 --> 48:35.120
You lose, try again.

48:35.120 --> 48:38.120
But no, I never was a good one.

48:38.120 --> 48:44.120
I just can't think of what it was.

48:44.120 --> 48:45.120
Let's ask our chat room.

48:45.120 --> 48:46.120
What?

48:46.120 --> 48:47.120
What do they think?

48:47.120 --> 48:50.120
You know, we need to do a list tonight.

48:50.120 --> 48:54.120
What game needs to be made into a movie?

48:54.120 --> 48:55.120
We can do it.

48:55.120 --> 48:56.120
Just three of us?

48:56.120 --> 48:57.120
Sure, why not?

48:57.120 --> 49:00.680
We'll put four things on instead of three okay fair enough, okay?

49:02.520 --> 49:08.760
Okay, I'm cool guys. We haven't done that ever no. Well. Okay. We'll do that. I thought we had to

49:09.520 --> 49:15.440
Well, I'll ask the orange lounge historian that such as dark to be our angel that follows the show better than we do

49:16.200 --> 49:20.960
If you've done that before I don't think we have I don't think that we've done that one I

49:20.960 --> 49:26.960
I know we've joked a lot about DDR the movie on this show, but I don't think we ever did that one.

49:26.960 --> 49:32.960
What a big hoax. You know, I laugh to this day about the people who thought it was going to happen.

49:32.960 --> 49:42.960
I still think, especially after seeing the Para Para manga, which I think came up on Vanilla Sky, I don't think it came up on this show because we didn't find it until Monday.

49:42.960 --> 49:54.260
Actually, the Power of Harm manga was the exact same story they were going to use for the DDR movie, so I'm thinking that, uh, people bought the story for the DDR movie and go,

49:54.260 --> 49:57.960
Well, let's just put it within the other Bomani game. They're never going to know the difference.

50:02.960 --> 50:04.460
So, back to your week and your day.

50:04.460 --> 50:13.460
I'm still waiting for Battle Royale Volume 3 to be out, and I haven't had a chance to go by Kinokuniya to pick up the others that I'm missing.

50:13.460 --> 50:20.460
So, apart from that, I decided that I'm going to start picking up another manga series after I'm done with Battle Royale.

50:20.460 --> 50:26.460
And that's Berserk, which is still going and very expensive, but I don't care. And that's really about it.

50:26.460 --> 50:29.460
Spent lots of time with my boy.

50:29.460 --> 50:33.460
Loki, we haven't heard much from you this show. Hey, chat room, no flooding.

50:33.460 --> 50:37.460
Alright, you're getting kicked.

50:37.460 --> 50:41.460
Every last one of you.

50:41.460 --> 50:45.460
Loki, we haven't heard much from you yet this show. What's up?

50:45.460 --> 50:49.460
I've eaten too much rice. I had two bowls of rice. I should have known better than that.

50:49.460 --> 50:53.460
But, I didn't do anything this week.

50:53.460 --> 50:57.460
And, just kind of hung out.

50:57.460 --> 51:06.520
Got a costume for Halloween, wore the costume for Halloween, and was working on my pads,

51:06.820 --> 51:09.420
or not my pads, my cabinet was working on it.

51:09.420 --> 51:11.560
I was going to finish it, or well not really finish it,

51:11.560 --> 51:13.240
but start actually putting it together today.

51:14.920 --> 51:20.420
But then I realized my measurements were off because the plans called for 5 eighths

51:20.420 --> 51:26.160
of an inch MDF to be used when I was using 3 quarters of an inch MDF.

51:26.160 --> 51:31.540
So I have to readjust some, but at least it's, you know, trimming down pieces, not, you know,

51:32.540 --> 51:36.700
not screwing myself over with pieces being too short, so that's always good.

51:37.260 --> 51:38.400
Still a pain in the ass.

51:38.400 --> 51:43.760
And then, I don't know, not too much other stuff has been going on.

51:43.760 --> 51:51.020
Just been sitting at home and stuff inside because it's cold out and went

51:51.020 --> 51:55.640
down the golf lane yesterday and I was okay and stupid people there.

51:55.640 --> 52:19.640
I don't know, not much, you'd think I'd be playing Castlevania since I bought it, but no I'm not, because I don't care, and thought about playing Zelda today but never actually got to play Zelda today, and I don't know, just broke waiting for more money, that's about it.

52:19.640 --> 52:26.160
My week was interesting because I was on vacation this week

52:26.160 --> 52:29.040
and originally my plan was to go to West Hollywood for Halloween.

52:29.040 --> 52:31.100
Because, you know, I want to be with my people on Halloween.

52:31.560 --> 52:33.800
But it didn't end up happening.

52:33.800 --> 52:37.020
We decided to cancel the trip, mostly because of the fires that were going on in SoCal.

52:37.020 --> 52:39.000
We kind of didn't want to end up in the middle of all of it.

52:39.000 --> 52:43.620
My friend has really bad asthma and was afraid that the ash in the air might get to him.

52:43.620 --> 52:45.440
Contacts as well, things like that.

52:46.040 --> 52:48.220
And just some other stuff that came up.

52:48.220 --> 52:49.420
So we ended up going on the trip.

52:49.420 --> 52:53.180
So I've kind of just been having a lazy vacation.

52:53.180 --> 52:55.300
I've just been sitting on my big butt.

52:55.300 --> 52:58.340
I literally think I've gained three pounds while on this

52:58.340 --> 52:59.680
vacation, and I don't care.

52:59.680 --> 53:05.520
Because I've kind of just needed it, I think, because

53:05.520 --> 53:07.180
I've been working really hard nonstop for the

53:07.180 --> 53:08.000
past couple months.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.020
And it's going to be crazy.

53:09.020 --> 53:11.180
This holiday season right up until Christmas is going to be

53:11.180 --> 53:11.900
really crazy.

53:11.900 --> 53:13.700
I'm just not going to have any time for anything.

53:13.700 --> 53:17.300
So I'm kind of glad I kind of got a little vacation before I

53:17.300 --> 53:17.860
have to go back.

53:17.860 --> 53:20.880
Sometimes a vacation can be taken in your living room.

53:21.360 --> 53:23.560
And I played a lot of Final Fantasy XI.

53:23.980 --> 53:25.920
I'll talk about Final Fantasy XI a little later in the show,

53:26.920 --> 53:28.600
much to Jamie's dislike.

53:28.720 --> 53:30.000
But she'll just have to deal with it.

53:30.120 --> 53:33.160
It means I have to buy a new freaking graphics card

53:33.160 --> 53:33.960
if I want to get it.

53:34.220 --> 53:36.060
I don't feel like spending the money on it.

53:36.380 --> 53:38.540
When Ragnarok is hitting me just fine.

53:38.980 --> 53:43.860
So that was pretty much my week and my day.

53:43.860 --> 53:46.640
Today not a whole lot going on.

53:46.640 --> 53:50.340
and I've just been sleeping in, I try to get myself back

53:50.340 --> 53:52.000
on a regular sleep schedule because I've got to get

53:52.000 --> 53:53.940
up early and go back to work tomorrow, so I don't want

53:53.940 --> 53:56.840
to be on too crazy of a sleep schedule because I don't want

53:56.840 --> 53:58.320
to be an irritable bitch tomorrow.

53:59.820 --> 54:00.580
That's pretty much it.

54:01.000 --> 54:04.140
Oh, at least you're not going in for the 5.30 shift.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.940
No, but I am going in a half hour early tomorrow,

54:06.940 --> 54:09.340
which means we're going in at 7, which for me is early,

54:09.460 --> 54:10.040
so we'll see.

54:10.220 --> 54:11.580
I think we work the same shift.

54:12.520 --> 54:14.900
I work 7.30 to 4 usually.

54:14.900 --> 54:15.900
Oh, 7.30, 4.30.

54:15.900 --> 54:19.740
I only take a half for lunch.

54:19.740 --> 54:23.660
I have something to tell you later though, which might be interesting.

54:23.660 --> 54:26.780
Oh really? Yes, my work is moving in a few months.

54:26.780 --> 54:30.420
Oh, to near me? To the area I used to work in.

54:30.420 --> 54:33.940
Oh, okay. That's cool. Cool deal.

54:33.940 --> 54:38.780
Okay, well I think we're going to do this break is we're going to

54:38.780 --> 54:41.860
take another break actually right now and then we're going to come back and we

54:41.860 --> 54:44.580
actually have some Bahmani things to talk about so we'll do that.

54:44.580 --> 54:49.100
We have the cage match still, the FUs of the week, of course, all that fun stuff.

54:49.300 --> 54:51.300
What do you want to hear?

54:51.300 --> 54:52.600
Talk about the break.

54:53.200 --> 54:56.440
Okay, we're going to, since we did a TAC break last time, I think what we're going

54:56.440 --> 54:58.960
to do this time is we'll take a TAC break.

55:00.040 --> 55:00.760
Won't that be fun?

55:01.680 --> 55:07.940
Yay. So, we'll be back and some Bomani news to talk about, among other things.

55:07.940 --> 55:15.620
Join our chat room, www.calibomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on Chat.

55:16.400 --> 55:18.820
And while I look for the MP3, I want this break.

55:18.820 --> 55:24.580
I think that later on during the show, though, we need to do a break of another's.

55:25.860 --> 55:26.640
We could do that.

55:27.600 --> 55:27.780
We could.

55:27.780 --> 55:30.980
Because, you know, I'm really, really, really, sometimes today,

55:31.340 --> 55:32.860
wanting to hear leading cyber another.

55:33.380 --> 55:34.480
We'll see if we can arrange that.

55:34.480 --> 55:41.480
Alright, we're going to take a break with some Taka music and we will be back.

56:04.480 --> 56:09.480
Yeah.

56:09.480 --> 56:14.480
Yeah.

56:14.480 --> 56:19.480
Yeah.

56:19.480 --> 56:24.480
Yeah.

56:24.480 --> 56:29.480
Yeah.

57:29.480 --> 57:31.480
You

59:29.480 --> 59:31.480
You

59:59.480 --> 01:00:14.480
Maybe they've seen us, and welcome us all So many like you to all, and things to be found

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:19.480
I'm still not alone, it turns out

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:22.480
The final countdown

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:28.480
The final countdown

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:39.480
Orange Lounge Radio. We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:49.480
Howdy. We're back. Did you miss us?

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:55.480
Orange Lounge Radio episode number 67. We're in the middle of it right now.

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.000
right now.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.600
Yeah, and it's gooey and sticky.

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:01.120
Big station news.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:02.640
Big, big station news.

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:08.400
There's a lot of shit coming to the station in November.

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:13.560
First off, this Wednesday is the return of Live Wire.

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:15.240
So you better be listening, because we don't want

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:17.240
Loki to have another fit.

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:19.180
But no, if you're not listening, you're seriously

01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:20.640
missing out, because it's some good stuff.

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.200
Oh, if you're not listening, you're a poopy head.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:22.680
That's right.

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:26.840
you're missing out on live mixing of dance, trance, and sometimes,

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:28.840
sometimes once in a while, a bimani song.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.480
Of dance, trance, and antsy?

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:33.920
Is there anything you want to say about Loki?

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:36.340
He's too busy thumbing through my Final Fantasy XI manual.

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:37.020
No, he says no.

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:37.820
Isn't, oh.

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:39.340
Loki, you're being awfully quiet tonight.

01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:40.040
Is everything okay?

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:40.860
Are you feeling all right?

01:02:40.860 --> 01:02:41.720
I have a headache.

01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:43.180
Aww, he has a headache.

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:44.100
Do you want some?

01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:44.720
You want some new bread?

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:45.060
Advil?

01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:46.680
Mine is just outside.

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:47.500
Oh, it's outside.

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:52.440
So we have Livewire returning on Wednesday.

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:56.780
This week, by the way, this week and one week only, Vanilla Sky

01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:58.460
and Pump Up the Volume are changing nights.

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:00.420
So Pump Up the Volume will be on Monday.

01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:02.100
Vanilla Sky will be on Tuesday.

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:02.660
Just so you know.

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:06.040
And I'm probably going to be away from the computer quite a bit.

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:06.820
Don't tell them that.

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:07.480
Well, no.

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:09.980
But that has to do with Jamie's trip because she's leaving on Tuesday.

01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:12.040
Yeah, because I actually, I packed today.

01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:13.340
My clothes are packed today.

01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:13.520
Oh, okay, cool.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:15.560
I just have, you know, my other little things to pack.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:20.580
But, and I'm hoping that people actually make requests this time around.

01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:25.220
And lots of people listen, make it a good show for me because I won't be able to do it

01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:27.680
for two weeks, but you get to hear old shows.

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:33.880
But apart from that, you know, listen, request.

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:41.800
Also coming to the station in November, something that you guys have been asking me

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:46.420
about for a long time, Sunday, November 23rd, mark your calendars,

01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:51.560
Sunday, November 23rd is season four, excuse me, of Orange Lounge Radio,

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:53.860
the debut, and that's going to be Jamie's return, because she'll be back

01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:59.180
from Alabama, and it's episode number 70, and that is when the station

01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:01.480
is going to go to MP3 Pro.

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:08.600
Depending on Live 365's setup, we may or may not be able to have the live

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:13.400
shows an MP3 Pro, but our Bahmani Music Amor program will be an MP3 Pro. For those who

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:18.880
don't know what MP3 Pro is, we'll have details on our website at that point about how you

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:23.680
can get DSL quality sound over your modem connection with MP3 Pro. It's very cool.

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:28.080
Why are you being so biased? What about cable quality?

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:35.160
Okay, cable, highest, and better quality, because life uses five buttons that is DSL

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:36.160
quality.

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.160
I'm teasing.

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:38.160
Way better quality. How about this?

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:42.720
Broadband Quality Radio over your modem.

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:44.800
That would be great.

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:45.880
Oh, I had the ferret in the air.

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:49.720
And also, just before Jamie gets back from break, we will

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.640
be setting the ferrets on fire live.

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:53.480
No!

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:56.520
I will hide the ferrets.

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:59.320
Hey, babies.

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:02.000
The ferrets love me here.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.400
Look, don't kill the babies.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:05.880
You fat murderer!

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:07.520
You're going to have to take them to Alabama with you if

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:10.560
You don't want them to die.

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:12.680
You are anti-ferret.

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:16.600
I think that's all the news for now, coming up to the station soon.

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:17.600
Yeah, you're right.

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:18.600
I'm anti-ferret.

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:22.280
There is one other thing.

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:29.080
I was hoping tonight we would have new Papa Music 10 MP3s to debut for you because we've

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:32.480
gotten the connection to get the music for it.

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:36.120
There is some great stuff on the Papa Music 10 soundtrack, honestly.

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:37.900
I know a lot of people have always been kind of,

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:40.320
pop and music stuff's kind of cheesy, things like that.

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:43.200
But seriously, there's some good shit on pop and music 10.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.560
And you guys have to hear it.

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:50.480
For instance, Tack doing a duet with Desrow.

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:51.900
Oh, God.

01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:52.900
Very interesting.

01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:54.440
It sounds a lot like Distress.

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.960
That would just make me so.

01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:00.920
Tacko with a new trance song and he got together with somebody

01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:02.560
and I can't fucking remember who it was.

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:03.160
I apologize.

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.560
I'll have to see when I get the soundtrack.

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:12.160
And then, this is the greatest one of all, Mr. T doing Goonies Are Good Enough.

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.160
Cool.

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:16.640
It is the coolest thing I've ever heard in a Bobondi game in my life.

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.400
I cannot wait.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:21.960
So I can't wait.

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:22.960
That's going to be great.

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:26.800
And I'm still looking for a attack.

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:34.400
What I'm thinking is maybe Thursday or so we'll have like a Pop and Music 10 debut special.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:40.600
will be pre-taped. It won't be a live thing. Just some music so you guys can hear it.

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:41.600
That's going to be awesome.

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:46.600
I still remember being all happy about hearing the Yamato theme.

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:50.600
Yeah, the Yamato theme from Pop'n Music. Maybe we'll play some Pop'n Music MV3s later.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.600
And the Lum song.

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.400
Yeah, that song?

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:56.400
The Lum theme song.

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:57.400
Oh, okay.

01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:04.400
the

01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:11.700
so hopefully we'll have those pop music ten mps for you soon

01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:12.720
uh...

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:16.740
there's also the trial freaks uh... new music that's out to but uh... i don't

01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:19.540
know if there's anything on our land right now maybe we'll be able to get to

01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:21.560
a later in the show we'll see

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:25.740
i still need to be more home versions of the guitar freaks games

01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:26.900
I do too.

01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:31.340
You know, I have a freaking drum mania controller and two guitar freaks controllers

01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:33.020
and no session.

01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:36.400
No new sessions for me.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:39.940
And they need to figure out how to get keyboard mania to work with it too.

01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:42.480
I agree.

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:43.720
My poor

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:45.000
dust collected

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.980
keyboard mania.

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:51.100
I haven't played keyboard mania. I never even did bother to buy second and third.

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:54.400
Oh yeah, second and third did better than the first one.

01:07:54.400 --> 01:08:01.280
You know what's nice? What's nice is I'll finally be able to dust off my 2DX controller because they have the

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:04.860
signatures they needed or whatever to get the

01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:06.820
get the new

01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:08.440
consumer style made.

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:13.680
Well, I'm hoping that if I have the money available I might just

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:17.880
when they do the new arcade style controller release

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:22.960
just breaking down and ordering mine through Himea.

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:29.360
I'm hoping that in the new 2DX consumer style that they have every Konami original from

01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:30.360
7th, 8th, and 9th style.

01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:31.680
That would be so beautiful.

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:32.680
I'd cry.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:34.960
That would be pretty cool.

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:39.480
And you know, now that we've seen DDR Extreme, we know that Konami is willing to put 100

01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:41.160
plus songs in a home mix.

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:46.560
So there's no reason why they can't do DDR without it.

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:51.920
And then they need to put TAC in a box and ship them to my house.

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:54.920
It can mix for me all day at gunpoint.

01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:58.920
Well, let's see some other news going on right now in the Bamani world.

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:01.920
I wanted to read this for you guys.

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:03.920
I've got to pull up the story, though.

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:06.920
Jamie, feel time.

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:12.920
Hey, I hear it.

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:13.920
You know what?

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:14.920
What?

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:16.920
I'm sitting on the floor, and I don't know why.

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:18.920
Why are you sitting on the floor tonight?

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:23.440
and it's not in front of the camera.

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.480
I can hide here effectively.

01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:29.600
Not many places I can hide effectively from the webcam.

01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:31.560
Actually, yeah, there are.

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:32.360
There are plenty of places.

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:32.960
All right.

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.640
Here's what I wanted to get into.

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:40.420
The song list is released for DDRXBox, also, DDR UltraMix,

01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:42.520
because a lot of us have been calling it DDRXBox.

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:46.240
The full song list is out, and so I thought we'd go over it

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:49.100
and get your guys' reactions to the songs that are on it.

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:49.940
What do you guys think?

01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:51.320
Loki, you with us?

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:52.680
Okay, cool.

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:54.400
0.59 by DJ Taka.

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:55.800
We.

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:59.080
Absolute, The Cuff N' Stuff It Mix by Thuggy D,

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:01.060
which would pretty much be Scotty D.

01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:03.140
That's stupid.

01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:03.980
What?

01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:05.640
It sounds kind of stupid, the name.

01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:08.760
Yeah, The Cuff N' Stuff It Mix sounds a little,

01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:09.920
I'm worried because I'm wondering

01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:12.360
if it's gonna be like a rap version of Absolute, you know?

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:13.200
Okay, that would suit.

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:15.600
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:18.980
That would suck more than anything has sucked before.

01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:20.560
Except for that, don't move.

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:23.400
I'm going to, I'm going to just have high hopes.

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:28.740
Hi, we're still here.

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:38.120
Also on DDR UltraMix, after the game of love, notice it's not after the game,

01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:42.680
but because Xbox will be a little more scandalous, they're going with after the game of love.

01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:52.200
A new transplant song from 2DX, Ballad For You is going to be an ultra mix, that should

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:53.200
be interesting.

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:57.800
But it's Thomas Howard, so all you Thomas Howard fanboys and girls will be...

01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:01.480
That is not a good Thomas Howard song.

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:03.440
Like it or not, there it is.

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:07.440
Candy Heart will be in the new DDR.

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:10.240
Can't Stop Following in Love, the speed mix by Naoki.

01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:11.800
Oh yay, speed mix.

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:18.240
A new license song, Castles in the Sky, Ian Van Dowell featuring Marsha, will be a song

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.240
in Xbox.

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:20.240
Marsha, Marsha, Marsha!

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:23.800
We'll play that for you later in the show if we have time.

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:24.800
Does it suck?

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:25.800
It's pretty good.

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:26.800
I like it.

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:29.560
It's on the same par as Will I in Max 2.

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:34.080
I think I like Will I a little bit more, but Castles in the Sky is not bad.

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:35.560
Dive by B4U.

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:38.680
Oh, the joy.

01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:43.660
Do That Thing by Masai, that's another licensed song, I've never heard this song.

01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:45.300
What's That Thing?

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:50.300
It's Do That Thang, with an A, it's a thang, not a thing but a thang.

01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:55.140
Is that like Thing's cousin thang, you know like a foot that comes out of a box?

01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:58.260
The thang, you know it's the new thang.

01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:00.820
Drop the Bomb, the System SF remix.

01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:03.140
Oh Joy, Oh Rapture.

01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:05.140
DXY by Tack.

01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:07.520
Electro-Tuned by Tack.

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:09.520
Exotic ethnic by revengee.

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:11.020
Oh, yay.

01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:15.240
Uh... healing vision by desire. At least it's not the stupid angelic mix.

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:22.240
What? You don't like the angelic mix?

01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:26.560
The angelic mix is like one of my favorite remixes of any DDR song ever.

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:30.680
The angelic mix gives me a splitting headache every time I listen to it.

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:34.800
Is it just the beep? Take the beep out though and it's a beautiful remix. That's okay, I still like the original better.

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:37.120
You are weird.

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:41.440
Hypnotic Crisis by the Blue Destroyers, that should be interesting.

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:48.260
My First Cata, Hysteria by Naoki190, because you have to have your generic Konami trying

01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:50.420
to do rap song.

01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:55.500
Another transplant from 2DX, and this is a really good one in my opinion, Infinite Prayer

01:12:55.500 --> 01:13:00.340
by LED, and what's most interesting about that is I had heard rumors that LED had left

01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:04.740
Konami, I don't know if they're true or not, but if I'm not mistaken we haven't had any

01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:07.180
new LED songs in a while, but kind of interesting.

01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:08.660
Infinite Prayer is going to be in DDR.

01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:10.340
Which mix, is this the standard?

01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:11.380
It's the standard.

01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:13.980
Wouldn't it be cool if they put the floating block in?

01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:15.860
Because that's my favorite mix of that.

01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:16.700
It would be nice.

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:18.860
And there are still 10 unlocked, so you never know.

01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:21.260
But this is the original that's going to be in it.

01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:24.620
But the original original was, if I'm not mistaken, was a

01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:26.260
club mix song before it was a 2DX song.

01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:28.820
I think so.

01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:32.500
Insertion, the Machine Gun Kelly mix, a remix of

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:36.460
of insertion by Thuggy D. So we can look forward to a wrap

01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:37.420
mix of insertion.

01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:39.660
That should be interesting.

01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:41.920
But that might be kind of good, because there's a lot of

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:43.260
good rap out there about insertion.

01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:48.020
Oh, by the way, that's something else I need to do.

01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:49.780
Oh, I'm going to stick my what?

01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:51.340
I need to bring up something after the list.

01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:53.460
All right.

01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:59.060
Keep on moving the DMX mix by NMR Type G. It's kind of new,

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:00.500
very interesting.

01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:01.780
It's not new, says Loki.

01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:03.740
Where is it from?

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:06.140
It's from Dance Maniacs.

01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:07.340
Oh.

01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:08.180
Oh, I'll be damned.

01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:09.060
It sure is.

01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:10.580
My bad.

01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:13.380
My bad.

01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:15.220
Oh, maybe we'll have to listen to that later.

01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:18.340
Keep Your Body Movin' by Thuggy D. It's a new Konami

01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:19.620
original there.

01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:21.140
Thuggy D.

01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:22.340
Oh, you have it?

01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:24.660
Are we going to hear it?

01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:27.580
OK, so this is a little bit of Keep On Movin' the DMX mix.

01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:29.940
Just a little clip.

01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:31.940
I'm curious how different this is in the original.

01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:51.940
It's kinda ghetto. I don't think I like it. Whatever. Turn this shit off.

01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:54.940
It sounds like a bad another.

01:14:54.940 --> 01:15:00.940
God, I'm a stupid asshole. DMX mix, of course, that means dance maniacs mix. God, I'm a tard.

01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:02.940
You do know some rap mix. Call the truth.

01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:08.940
Kind Lady by Okiatos. We all know Kind Lady. It's been in every DDR mix.

01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:09.940
We need the 80s one.

01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:14.940
I like Kind Lady, too. I'm glad it's there. La Senorita Virtual by T.M.E.

01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:16.940
The worst version of that song.

01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:21.940
I've heard much worse DDR mixes than La Senorita Virtual.

01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:23.940
I never really cared for that one.

01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:26.940
OK.

01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:30.780
Also going to be in DDR UltraMix will be Let the Beat Hit Em,

01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:34.300
classic R&B style, because it's just not DDR without some

01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:35.860
crappy mix of Let the Beat Hit Em.

01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:38.900
You know that the only version of that one I really liked was

01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:41.100
the one that was in Max.

01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:42.380
I think that's it.

01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:42.980
That's the one.

01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:44.740
Then that's the good one.

01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:47.220
Let's Talk It Over.

01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:48.780
That's decent.

01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:51.620
Look to the Sky, the True Color mix.

01:15:51.620 --> 01:16:07.420
Love to Me, the disco mix, by Yamato, On the Jazz, Overblast by LED Light, Paranoia Eternal,

01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:13.700
the fan written Paranoia, A New Transplant, new to DDR UltraMix, Quickening by DJ Taka,

01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:20.320
that's a very cool one, a licensed song, this will be a lot of fun, Paul Oakenfold with

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:24.880
Ready Steady Go. I don't know the song but... Hey, I have the CD. It's on my CD. Oh, cool.

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:31.160
It's like the first track I think on the Buka CD. Maybe we'll get to that song later. Santa

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:37.040
Melente Nante, of course, a fan favorite. Togo Project featuring Sana. That'll be good.

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:43.960
Secret Rendezvous by the Divas. Ooh. Sexy Planet by Crystal Aliens. Kind of one of those

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:48.220
songs that a lot of people thought we wouldn't see because American audiences can't handle

01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:54.180
the word sex. It's Sensual Planet. It's Sensual Planet, but believe it or not it is coming

01:16:54.180 --> 01:17:01.740
to DDR UltraMix. This is the licensed song I'm most excited about. Shiny Disco Balls

01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:07.220
by Huda Funk. I love this song. I can't wait to play it. I've never heard it. Late night,

01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:10.900
rock and roll fellas. Oh, we're going to hear a little clip of Shiny Disco Balls right here.

01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:17.900
here. Can we hear a clip of it? I'm not hearing it. Get to the lyrics. We're skipping around

01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:29.620
the mp3 a little bit. This is an extended mix of the song. I love this song. It's really

01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:33.620
I love this song. It's really repetitive, but I love it.

01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:38.620
Ready, steady, go is better, stop doing this.

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:41.620
Anyway, that'll be fun.

01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:44.620
So In Love by Caramel S.

01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:46.620
Okay.

01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:48.620
That'll be in Dior Ultra Mix.

01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:51.620
Superstar, DJ Rich featuring Tell Brothers.

01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:54.620
God, has there been a home mix that Superstar was not on?

01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:58.620
Sweet, Sweet Heart Magic.

01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:02.620
The Heart Magic, by June.

01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:04.620
The Earth Light, by L.E.D. Light.

01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:06.620
That's cool.

01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:09.620
A new Konami original by ThuggyD, once again.

01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:12.620
There For You.

01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:14.620
That should be interesting.

01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:17.620
Trip Machine, The Love Mix, by 2MB.

01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:18.620
The Love Mix.

01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:20.620
And lastly...

01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:21.620
Yes, Logie?

01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:22.620
Go ahead.

01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:25.620
Lastly, Tsugaru, Revenge vs. Desire.

01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:26.620
Yes, Logie.

01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:29.100
one that they didn't put on there, but it's going to be an unlock.

01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:31.740
Mind Parasite from Dance Maniacs is going to be on there.

01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:35.880
Also, Colors is rumored to be in the game as well.

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:39.060
Now, this is the interesting thing is don't forget there's ten unlocks,

01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:46.760
but also DDR UltraMix is going to have the pay for new songs feature,

01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:47.640
which is going to be interesting.

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:51.240
And this is what I've heard, this is what's come off of DDR Freak.

01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:57.120
I read in some post by Order of Chaos, who's the producer for DDR UltraMix, said something

01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:06.940
about five songs, $5. What do you guys think? Is this a good idea for DDR? Shitty idea?

01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:13.540
Only ten unlocks this time, but five songs, $5. What do you think, Loki?

01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:18.400
That's fine, I'm sure, because it's obviously going to download to the hard drive. So whenever

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:22.040
If there's a transfer of files, there'll be a way to pirate the songs anyways.

01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:25.240
And it doesn't matter anyways, because someone's going to buy it for five bucks.

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:26.760
Put the same files online, I'll give it a free.

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:33.840
They apparently have forgotten about the little device called the Xbox GameShark, and people

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:34.840
with laptops.

01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:38.600
Who can save those files to their laptops?

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:42.640
All illegality aside, let's assume we played by the legal way here.

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:43.640
What do you guys think of it?

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:46.360
That's five dollars I could get a sandwich with.

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:47.360
That's only five bucks.

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:50.800
I mean, I throw $5 down for lunch, so, you know,

01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:52.960
I eat at home one day, I get five songs.

01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:56.480
As long as they're not shit, because I can see it being,

01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:58.280
like, utter shit that they're going to put on there,

01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:00.460
but if it was good stuff, yeah.

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:05.540
Let them move, the Let Them Move remix, the, you know,

01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:09.520
like, Forever Sunshine.

01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:14.520
They have like a set of five that's all newt remixes.

01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:22.400
Yes, they're going to have a pack with Forever Sunshine and Let Them Move and God, what else

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:25.960
is DDR song no one likes?

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:26.960
Crash.

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:27.960
Crash.

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:28.960
Thank you.

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:30.400
And more B For You songs.

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:36.680
And then an original with Yoko Ono.

01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:42.420
bag for you the Thuggy D remix. Yes, it'll be bagged for you by Thuggy D.

01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:48.420
Featuring, um, what's-her-face from, from, uh, you know the song that used to be in DDR?

01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:49.520
What? Shit.

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:53.920
Shit? I don't know that song. Panorama.

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:57.860
You know what's interesting about this mix? You know what I'm just noticing that is very

01:20:57.860 --> 01:21:02.920
interesting about this mix? There is only one song in this entire mix that has Polteri

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:10.800
in it I'm thinking I'm thinking one of those expansion packs I'm gonna call it

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:14.680
right here one of those expansion packs is gonna be five now keep featuring

01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:19.020
Polteri songs god help I'm gonna bet you anything that's anything I don't people

01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:23.200
there's people who like yes there are people there's people who can't sing

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:27.480
there's people who come to this show on Monday nights this week Tuesday who like

01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:32.600
voluntary so there are people out there who like voluntary but I just think that

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:39.680
you're saying you know I was feeling to be in in a shitty DDR song I forgot

01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:48.520
about when was all coming out again when was this coming out ultra mix is out

01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:49.520
I don't know.

01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:50.520
I'm out November.

01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:51.520
Sometime this month.

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:52.520
I don't remember the date.

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:53.520
I think the 18th.

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:54.520
The 18th.

01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:55.520
We'll see.

01:21:55.520 --> 01:22:00.520
I want to get an Xbox anyway, so we'll see.

01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:02.520
Hold this for a second.

01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:03.520
I'll find out.

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:04.520
You're weak.

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:07.520
Oh, Jamie's going to make a phone call.

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:09.520
Actually, somebody in our chat room will probably post it.

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:13.520
But Jamie's going to get an official word.

01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:14.520
Yeah, it's in the same.

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:15.520
Oh, hello.

01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:17.520
It's in the same post as the song list.

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:18.760
Thank you.

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:22.960
It is the November 18th.

01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:33.620
So also rumored to be in the mix that we haven't seen any

01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:37.040
proof of yet, but Metal Gear Solid 2, the

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:38.360
theme, I think it is.

01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:42.880
Or maybe it's that mix from Six Mix.

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:43.960
That would be awesome.

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:46.660
Very cool.

01:22:46.660 --> 01:22:50.560
Do you have that Paul Logan-fold song? Do you want to play a little bit of that?

01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:53.560
Oh, you don't have that one? What about the other one that was in there? There was another one we said we want to play.

01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:55.820
Oh, Castles in the Sky, I have that one.

01:22:55.820 --> 01:22:58.960
You have that?

01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:03.420
Let's race and see who can pull it up first.

01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:07.260
This is really good radio. I know, this is great radio. Loki and I are having a race right now.

01:23:07.260 --> 01:23:09.620
By the way, I vouch for chloroceptic.

01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:13.100
It really works. Okay, got it.

01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:20.100
Here's Castles in the Sky.

01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:37.620
That's Castles in the Sky if you're curious.

01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:39.060
It sounds pretty typical.

01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:47.380
Yeah, it sounds very much like Will I. I prefer Will I to that song, but I heard a rumor that

01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:52.740
the steps were going to be insane to that song, so we'll see. They might have some really

01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:55.300
good original steps to that.

01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:58.020
I have a little bit of news.

01:23:58.020 --> 01:23:59.020
Oh, really?

01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:00.700
Have you read anything on Yahoo?

01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:02.680
Give me your news.

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:09.160
Now the FCC has said that it is okay to say fuck on national television.

01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:10.400
What? Really?

01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:14.080
As long as it is not used to describe fucking.

01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:21.320
That's the same way, you know what, that's the same rule you can use to say the word fuck in a PG-13 movie.

01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:24.240
You can't say asshole, but you can say ass.

01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:26.320
Sweet.

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:30.000
So now you can say fuck on TV, I can't wait for next week's South Park.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.500
if this is fucking annoying, or this is fucking stupid, or fuck him, or...

01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:37.000
I cannot wait for next week's South Park.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:42.000
But yeah, and that all came up, I think it was someone who was accepting an award,

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:47.000
they go, well this is fucking awesome, and the FCC got a bunch of letters,

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:54.000
and they were like, well, he didn't actually say that, like, I'm going to go fuck this person, so...

01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:01.000
I'm going to go home and fuck my wife!

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:04.400
Chat room's itching for us to get our cage match on.

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:06.620
What do you guys think? Let's do it.

01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:08.240
Alright, let's do it.

01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:10.000
I didn't have to think of one this week.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:15.520
Yeah, I know you got saved this week. Let's do the orange launch cage match tonight, shall we?

01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:17.000
You know what sucks?

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.800
What? I think I deleted Holic off my computer.

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:23.440
That's okay, I know it's on Loki's, I can get it through there.

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:30.440
How dare you delete any tax? I had to delete so much stuff. Buy a hard drive! To make room for Final Fantasy XI is not even funny. Get a hard drive!

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:35.920
That's alright, we have Holly. You know what?

01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:38.060
I have a 120 gig hard drive.

01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:40.640
And I've used um...

01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:44.380
50 of it.

01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:47.340
I need to start burning off stuff off of my hard drive.

01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:50.260
Alright, ready? Because I'm lazy.

01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:53.860
from the Orange Launch Cage Match.

01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:58.180
Last week in the Cage Match, Jamie won the Cage Match.

01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:01.180
And her song was, do you want to introduce it?

01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:03.620
It was Little Flower

01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:07.100
by CyberX featuring Rapina, wasn't it?

01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:08.300
I think it was.

01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:11.020
And it won by quite a landslide.

01:26:11.020 --> 01:26:15.940
So will it win by a landslide again tonight? I don't know, we'll see. The way the Cage Match works,

01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:17.920
the three of us are going to pick a song

01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:19.840
and you're going to pick your favorite.

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:22.360
And your favorite, determined by your votes,

01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:23.680
that are sent to me in the chat room

01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:25.080
once we've done playing all three songs.

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:27.820
Your vote will determine what song goes into rotation

01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:31.320
all week long on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:32.600
So here it is, song number one

01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:33.500
that you can vote for tonight.

01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:35.120
Jamie's pick from last week, which one?

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:36.360
And you only get to hear a clip of it

01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:37.720
because it is the winner.

01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:41.200
This is CyberX featuring Rapinoe with Little Flower.

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:42.040
Enjoy.

01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:44.040
🎶🎶🎶

01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:44.040
Me

01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:54.040
I can't wait to see you in the next video!

01:28:55.040 --> 01:29:08.040
I can't wait to see you in the next video!

01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:15.040
Konnazura gite mou keshite Akira nazuni

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:20.040
You can't leave me without my love

01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:25.040
I'm not afraid of you

01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:30.040
I'm not afraid of you

01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:35.040
I'm not afraid of you

01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:40.040
I'm not afraid of you

01:29:40.040 --> 01:30:08.440
All right, that was song number one, last week's winner, CyberX featuring Rapinoe with

01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:13.440
I forgot to put that in the chat room.

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:15.480
Usually I announce what songs 1 and 2 are.

01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:19.080
So Jamie, tell us how wonderful that song is while I do that part.

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:20.740
It's a 9.

01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:21.740
It's chancy.

01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:22.740
No, no, no, no.

01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:23.740
You already rated it last week.

01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:25.580
You just have to go on about how great it is.

01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:26.580
It's awesome.

01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:31.800
You really, really like the song because you already really seem to like trance.

01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:38.500
It doesn't get much trancier than that unless it's das Scrockenspiel which puts me in a

01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:41.420
trance every time I drive and I usually run into things.

01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:44.420
Alright, Loki insists I do his song next.

01:30:44.420 --> 01:30:48.100
Oh, he's going to find it, well then I'm going to go next.

01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:53.580
My song I picked tonight, it's an older song, it's a few years old and actually those of

01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:57.020
you that listen to Understation Live on a regular basis may recognize this song because

01:30:57.020 --> 01:31:00.820
I know it's one of Travis' favorite break songs, but I've just been really addicted

01:31:00.820 --> 01:31:07.820
I think it would be awesome for DDR, in fact I'm gonna convince Loki to put it on his bootleg mix.

01:31:07.820 --> 01:31:16.820
I love this song a lot, and I hope you guys do too. I really didn't have any other good choices for tonight so I picked a nice little poppy techno song for you guys.

01:31:16.820 --> 01:31:18.820
I forgot to make a comment on chatroom.

01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:25.820
OLK is not spelled with an H, it's OOKI if you're going by Papa Romaji. Thank you.

01:31:25.820 --> 01:31:27.820
Well thank you for clarifying.

01:31:27.820 --> 01:31:36.060
Now, back to Gage Match, the song I picked is Tina Cousins and it's called Mysterious

01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:37.060
Times.

01:31:37.060 --> 01:31:39.060
Enjoy

01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:36.060
Life, a serious life, never moving around, dancing the rhythm of life.

01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:41.060
Time, mysterious time

01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:48.060
We're counting the hours and days till the end of all time

01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:53.060
We're feeling the change and we don't know why

01:32:54.060 --> 01:32:57.060
Choose one direction, just one more time

01:32:58.060 --> 01:33:02.060
Don't say I'm thinking too much if you see what's behind

01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:06.060
And these are mysterious times

01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:13.060
Mysterious times

01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:20.060
No truth of my mind

01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:27.060
For this moment I feel like we live in mysterious times

01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:35.060
If you feel what's behind, these are mysterious times

01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:45.060
So, I feel my soul

01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:52.060
For this moment nobody could stop me from flying so high

01:33:52.060 --> 01:34:05.060
Real, nothing is real In a war of illusion you only see what you

01:34:05.060 --> 01:34:10.060
feel You're revealing the change and we don't

01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:15.060
know why Choose one direction, just one for time

01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:20.060
Don't say I'm thinking too much if you see what's behind

01:34:20.060 --> 01:34:24.060
And these are mysterious times

01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:31.060
Mysterious times

01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:38.060
The truth of our minds

01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:45.060
For this moment I feel like we're living mysterious times

01:34:45.060 --> 01:34:52.060
If you see what's behind, these are mysterious times

01:34:52.060 --> 01:35:17.300
Okay, that was song number two tonight, that was Tina Cousins with Mysterious Times.

01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:18.300
And what did y'all think, Jamie?

01:35:18.300 --> 01:35:26.300
Um, it was pretty good. It was, uh, kind of repetitive. I'm eating rice. I got good rice, too.

01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:28.800
It doesn't taste like minute rice, either.

01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:29.800
Um, but no.

01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:30.800
I know.

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:34.300
It was okay. I give it an eight.

01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:36.300
Loki!

01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:40.800
It was okay. Seven.

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:46.300
Um, I was kind of strapped for songs this week, so I know that's not the best I can do.

01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:54.300
But I still like it, I mean it's a perfect DDR song, it's so perfect for DDR, so I give it eight or nine, eight and a half.

01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:58.300
Alright, Loki, what's your pick for this week?

01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:05.300
My pick for this week is Cool and the Gang, and it's a song called Get Down On It.

01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:14.300
It's the DJ, Jewie Jams, I gotta get the full title here, what is it, Scrolls on Boy here.

01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:20.380
It's a Brute Lake remix by DJ Jimmy Jam, whatever that is.

01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:26.540
And it's Get Down On It in 2001 by Cool in the Gang.

01:36:26.540 --> 01:36:27.580
All right, let's try it out.

01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:29.140
Here it is, Loki's pick for this week.

01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:36.140
Call the gang. Get down on it.

01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:42.940
I say, people, whatcha gonna do?

01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:48.620
You gotta get off the groove.

01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:55.940
Tell me, baby, how you gonna do it if you really don't wanna dance?

01:38:55.940 --> 01:38:59.040
by standing on the wall.

01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:02.080
Tell me, are you going to do it if you really

01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:06.280
want to take a dance by standing on the wall?

01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:08.240
Well, I heard all the music.

01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:10.380
Get down on it.

01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:12.280
Get down on it.

01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:13.760
Get down on it.

01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:14.760
Get down on it.

01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:15.760
Pull you down.

01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:17.240
Get down on it.

01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:19.240
Get down on it.

01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:21.240
Get down on it.

01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:22.240
Get down on it.

01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:24.240
Shalalalalala.

01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:27.720
What you gon' do if you want to get out?

01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:39.720
What you gon' do if you back up off the wall?

01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:41.220
Hey, come on.

01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:14.740
Standing on the wall, get your back up, up, up.

01:40:14.740 --> 01:40:17.060
Tell me, baby, how you gonna do it

01:40:17.060 --> 01:40:18.560
if you really go take a chance?

01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:22.160
By standing on the wall, get your back up, up, up.

01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:26.740
Listen, baby, you know it when you're dancing, yeah.

01:40:26.740 --> 01:40:30.740
You show it when you move, move, move.

01:40:30.740 --> 01:40:34.540
You know it when you'r dancing, yeah.

01:40:34.540 --> 01:40:38.460
You show it as you go across the block.

01:40:38.460 --> 01:40:40.240
Get down on it.

01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:14.240
If you really want it, you got to feel it.

01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:16.240
Get down on it.

01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:20.240
Come on and get down on it.

01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:23.240
While you're dancing, get down on it.

01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:25.240
Get down on it.

01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:26.240
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:41:26.240 --> 01:41:28.240
Oh, yeah.

01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:31.240
You can do me, baby, when you move.

01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:34.240
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:36.240
Get down on it.

01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:39.240
Get down on it.

01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:42.240
What you gon' do, if you wanna get out?

01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:44.240
I wonder if they're gonna do it for me?

01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:33.940

uh... it gets uh...

01:42:47.180 --> 01:42:51.700
seven point five for nostalgic coolness

01:42:51.700 --> 01:42:55.820
i give it a nine because it's like the second song that's on my cd that i'm listening to right now

01:42:55.820 --> 01:43:02.200

01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:04.020
i give it a three it was boring

01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:05.360
i didn't like it

01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:07.020

01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:08.540
hope you choke on it

01:43:08.540 --> 01:43:14.340
you give my song shitty scores all the time. I gave it a 7 you ass. This is an exception.

01:43:14.340 --> 01:43:18.140
I didn't like it. Deal with it.

01:43:18.140 --> 01:43:21.120
Cool in the Gang is usually good.

01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:24.780
Cool in the Gang is usually good. That just wasn't good.

01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:27.180
And what if it was Jungle Boogie?

01:43:27.180 --> 01:43:30.280

01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:41.940
All right, Loki, is there anything

01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:43.620
going on in the Sim world this week

01:44:43.620 --> 01:44:45.300
that's worth talking about?

01:44:45.300 --> 01:44:47.300
Uh, no.

01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:51.300
I have my beeps. I apologize. If you guys... Oh, sorry.

01:44:51.300 --> 01:44:55.300
If you guys are hearing beeps over the air, I apologize. I don't...

01:44:55.300 --> 01:44:59.300
They're not turned off for some reason. They got turned back on, so just deal with it.

01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:08.300
Um, no. Nothing really going on, unless you count, like, turning makes fourth plus, but, uh, no.

01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:12.300
Yeah, why don't you turn it off, you lazy bastard?

01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:16.020
What do I turn it off at?

01:45:16.020 --> 01:45:17.980
Yeah, people don't like hearing beeps.

01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:20.220
Shut up.

01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:22.020
I'll see if I can find the sounds option.

01:45:22.020 --> 01:45:25.740
Well, sort of simulated, I guess.

01:45:25.740 --> 01:45:30.180
It's been noted on a few of the message boards that that

01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:35.260
stupid bootleg DDR Megamix is actually running off a ported

01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:38.860
version of StepMania to the system 573 boards, which, you

01:45:38.860 --> 01:45:41.740
know, for those who don't know what that is, that's the

01:45:41.740 --> 01:45:49.820
hardware that all DDR machines run off of. So it's technically StepMania running on that

01:45:49.820 --> 01:46:00.020
and some special software and a hacked security chip. So why did the Freezeros look like shit?

01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:05.980
Because some of the files were corrupted on the disk, that's why. It was supposed to look

01:46:05.980 --> 01:46:11.740
nicer than that but doesn't matter though because it's still just DDR

01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:17.220
extreme they didn't add any new songs that's my favorite though is don't fall

01:46:17.220 --> 01:46:28.060
off yeah don't fall off or the AT-ST will step on you anyways yeah that's

01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:32.220
pretty much all that's going on nothing really big other than that I mean I'm

01:46:32.220 --> 01:46:40.020
I'm sure, I think they're in the process of making DDR, or Dancing Stage Fever, converting

01:46:40.020 --> 01:46:44.420
the songs over for StepMania, and they're still working on DDR Extreme, even though

01:46:44.420 --> 01:46:48.700
I could have had them done weeks ago, but I just don't care anymore, so.

01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:50.660
You don't get them from me, so there.

01:46:50.660 --> 01:46:57.740
And that's pretty much it, nothing really, oh, well, we can talk about Into the Groove,

01:46:57.740 --> 01:46:58.740
I guess that's simple.

01:46:58.740 --> 01:46:59.740
Why not?

01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:00.740
Go for it.

01:47:00.740 --> 01:47:09.300
So, this is a new arcade dancing game that's being developed by the people that do StepMania,

01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:14.980
Chris Danford, Kiehl, who you might remember, we have a song of his in rotation, and also

01:47:14.980 --> 01:47:21.180
Foyboy, I guess, or Fuby, I forget which one it was. I think it was Fuby, because he does

01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:29.900
the steps on DWI Insanity, and so basically they're making their own home version, or

01:47:29.900 --> 01:47:36.140
home version but eventually he's gonna go there but right now they're doing arcade mixes with

01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:44.380
this Into the Groove thing which it sort it's like DDR it's more like um I don't know it's just

01:47:44.380 --> 01:47:49.980
really weird looking that's all I gotta say it's really weird looking they're testing it right now

01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:55.740
in a couple arcades there's one in Seattle I think it's a couple arcades now yeah there's one

01:47:55.740 --> 01:48:00.740
They're doing one in Seattle and they're talking about doing one in Wisconsin. It's like one of the arcades.

01:48:00.740 --> 01:48:01.740
Wisconsin.

01:48:01.740 --> 01:48:04.740
Yeah, so they're doing those there.

01:48:04.740 --> 01:48:05.740
They're doing those there.

01:48:05.740 --> 01:48:06.740
They're actually doing those in Wisconsin.

01:48:06.740 --> 01:48:14.740
But so far it's like, I don't know, I've listened to some of the music on there and it sucks. It sucks really bad.

01:48:14.740 --> 01:48:17.740
I mean, Keel's good and all for, I guess, making music.

01:48:17.740 --> 01:48:18.740
Yeah, I like a lot of his stuff.

01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:21.740
I don't like any of the music that's in there so far.

01:48:21.740 --> 01:48:24.740
You just think they picked the wrong ones to put in the game?

01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:31.740
I don't know. They're just lame. They suck. It's just like playing that other game I was playing earlier.

01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:33.740
Oh, we'll have to talk about that later, too.

01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:48.740
But, um, God, no, it's not very good. They're like, this one guy posted this MP3 of the song Utopia that he loves, and I downloaded it and listened to it, and it's crap. I don't like it. I think it's retarded.

01:48:48.740 --> 01:48:50.740
Well, now that's just your big, fat opinion.

01:48:50.740 --> 01:48:53.740
Well, my big, fat opinion counts because, um...

01:48:53.740 --> 01:48:54.620
You have a microphone.

01:48:54.620 --> 01:48:56.100
I have, yeah, I have a microphone.

01:48:56.100 --> 01:48:57.300
I have pretty good-tasting music.

01:48:57.300 --> 01:49:02.500
There's a lot of music created by people, like custom music

01:49:02.500 --> 01:49:05.900
that's made by people that doesn't sound like MIDI, OK?

01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:07.380
This is what the stuff sounds like.

01:49:07.380 --> 01:49:09.340
It's just MIDI stuff.

01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:11.460
You can totally tell we're making this shit in Fruity

01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:14.060
Loops because everyone's like, oh, Fruity Loops is so

01:49:14.060 --> 01:49:16.620
awesome, so awesome it is.

01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:19.580
And then you go listen to these Japanese artists who do

01:49:19.580 --> 01:49:21.020
the independent music also.

01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:27.080
And, you know, it doesn't sound like, for loops, it sounds like a well-polished track.

01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:30.580
And this is the stuff that should be in there, but isn't.

01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:33.760
But they're going to, you know, license music, they say,

01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:37.040
which I don't think they're going to actually physically license music.

01:49:37.100 --> 01:49:43.620
But anyways, the whole thing runs off of, off of Linux, because they don't want to, you know,

01:49:43.620 --> 01:49:46.260
pay for Windows XP for every single machine.

01:49:46.260 --> 01:49:47.580
So it's running off of Linux.

01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:50.980
It's pretty much a reworked StepMania.

01:49:50.980 --> 01:49:56.100
It's more or less StepMania and they have different arrows and new mods and shit and

01:49:56.100 --> 01:50:00.020
mines and all the crap that StepMania has.

01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:02.340
It's just, I don't know.

01:50:02.340 --> 01:50:03.340
I watch people play.

01:50:03.340 --> 01:50:06.820
Oh, and there's songs with 11 and 12 footer steps.

01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:09.700
I think that is so unnecessary.

01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:10.700
It's retarded.

01:50:10.700 --> 01:50:14.620
I guess I shouldn't knock it until I've tried it, but I think the whole notion of songs

01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:17.820
that were built to kill people is just unnecessary.

01:50:17.820 --> 01:50:21.340
Honestly, Max Period was overdoing it.

01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:22.180
Was overdoing it.

01:50:22.180 --> 01:50:25.260
That end where it gets 600 beats per minute and stuff,

01:50:25.260 --> 01:50:27.140
that was just, it gets gay.

01:50:27.140 --> 01:50:29.460
Not to mention that the song was ass.

01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:32.100
It's just, it was really, really stupid what they're

01:50:32.100 --> 01:50:33.060
doing with it.

01:50:33.060 --> 01:50:35.580
But you know, whatever.

01:50:35.580 --> 01:50:38.860
If they say it's 50% done, it's not, you know, they can

01:50:38.860 --> 01:50:41.620
always change that stuff later if people don't like it.

01:50:41.620 --> 01:50:43.780
But the people they have testing it, if they're like,

01:50:43.780 --> 01:50:46.820
ooh, I get the bar rape on this song, it's harder than

01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:48.420
Legend of Max.

01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:52.540
With all due respect to the folks up in Seattle, there are

01:50:52.540 --> 01:50:56.740
the unreal players up there who can do this 11 and 12 stuff

01:50:56.740 --> 01:50:58.580
no problem.

01:50:58.580 --> 01:51:00.700
I worry that that's going to influence the

01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:01.860
development of the mix.

01:51:01.860 --> 01:51:05.940
And it's just like, OK, maybe one or two songs, yay, great.

01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:07.980
But keep it to a minimum.

01:51:07.980 --> 01:51:10.940
Me, personally, I enjoy those fun Seven Feet songs.

01:51:10.940 --> 01:51:12.980
I liked some of the Max 2 USA steps.

01:51:12.980 --> 01:51:14.540
I realize I'm in a minority.

01:51:14.540 --> 01:51:18.900
But I kind of like the fun stuff more than I like the let's kill me steps, you know.

01:51:18.900 --> 01:51:24.680
The whole point is, I mean, sure people like a challenge, but people like fun, intelligent steps too.

01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:27.880
There's a lot of songs that have intelligent steps, like Superstar.

01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:30.200
Superstar is a fun song to play, and it's not that hard.

01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:32.260
It's just fun.

01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:33.020
That's the whole point.

01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:34.820
And people play them over and over.

01:51:34.820 --> 01:51:37.920
I mean, once you play like a really hard song, the only reason you play is

01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:40.640
to show off the friends and say, oh, look, I beat this song.

01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:41.980
I mean, that's pretty much it.

01:51:41.980 --> 01:51:48.300
It's not like you play it for your own benefit, but I don't know.

01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:53.800
The whole idea about, you know, what the hell?

01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:55.820
Just let Jamie play with a webcam.

01:51:55.820 --> 01:51:56.500
She's having fun.

01:51:56.500 --> 01:51:57.060
Okay, okay.

01:51:57.540 --> 01:52:04.700
Anyway, it's the whole point of like people, you know, making these bootlegs and stuff.

01:52:04.700 --> 01:52:09.660
It's just, I don't know, it's very interesting to me and how Konami,

01:52:09.660 --> 01:52:14.740
See, because technical economics can't really do much about it, because they're not,

01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:18.120
the machines aren't supposed to be over here in the first place, and they're kind of just,

01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:21.880
you know, getting by licensing in various manners,

01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:24.440
by like pretending they don't exist type of thing.

01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:28.000
And so, kind of people have free reign on doing that.

01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:31.040
The only people that can come down on them are people in the United States,

01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:32.880
like the RIAA and stuff like that.

01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:35.560
Now, I think where they're going to run the trouble is

01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:37.920
because they're selling the machine, and that's the problem.

01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:53.920
Now, my thing on it which I was posing to our local arcade here is that you just do one custom homemade upgrade for one arcade.

01:52:53.920 --> 01:52:58.920
I think the damage done by that would be minimal and the risk on it isn't that bad.

01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:06.360
that bad. The repercussions would be like nothing. So, I posed that idea to our arcade

01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:12.780
manager and they're actually interested. So, I don't know. We'll see. But I know later

01:53:12.780 --> 01:53:18.280
this week I'm going down to the arcade and we're going to rip open the machine to see

01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:23.760
what we can do as far as feasibly, you know, upgrading it that way. And all I got to say

01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:27.880
is if I do end up doing that, it's going to look nice and it'll be a lot better than all

01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:28.880
this other shit.

01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:33.720
And it's this, I've got word from, I heard this, this is

01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:35.720
pretty big news.

01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:37.200
Well, supposedly, I don't know.

01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:43.280
They posted this about the next generation DDR, but it's

01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:46.040
going to be coming out in like two or three years.

01:53:46.040 --> 01:53:48.160
Oh my god.

01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:51.280
What about this Euromix that they're getting that's going to

01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:52.920
be on the new hardware, supposedly?

01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:54.800
Well, that's Euromix.

01:53:54.800 --> 01:53:57.040
But still, they get stuff.

01:53:57.040 --> 01:53:58.520
Well, remember, if you remember correctly.

01:53:58.520 --> 01:54:00.360
It'll be a preview of what we can expect.

01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:03.040
We're supposed to do new hardware with DDR Extreme,

01:54:03.040 --> 01:54:03.920
but they never did.

01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:04.420
True.

01:54:04.420 --> 01:54:04.920
True.

01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:07.420
So.

01:54:07.420 --> 01:54:07.920
Whatever.

01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:10.600
I mean, for all this talk that DDR is dead in Japan,

01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:13.280
I mean, then why was Extreme the number seven selling game?

01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:14.040
It's debut week.

01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:14.880
You know, in the top 10.

01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:15.520
It's not dead.

01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:17.080
Look at 2DX.

01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:19.600
Yep, they're freaking, you know, begged for a new game.

01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:21.100
That's a whole other story, though.

01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:24.360
That's just Konami being dicks.

01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:25.920
All right, you guys want to know who

01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:32.920
won the cage match tonight? Tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge cage match is Holik.

01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:41.480
No, it's... It is a tie, ladies and gentlemen. The tie tonight...

01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:46.120
Stop tying people, God. I know, they always tie like every week.

01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:50.160
We used to never have ties, and lately, in like past eight shows, we've had like six

01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:56.780
ties. Anyway, the tie tonight is between two songs. It's between last week's winner, Little

01:54:56.780 --> 01:55:09.780
Flower, and the second song that tied this week is Cool and the Gang with Get Down On

01:55:09.780 --> 01:55:18.380
It, the 2001 mix. So, as you know, when we have a tie in the Orange Lounge Cage match,

01:55:18.380 --> 01:55:26.220
The host, who did not win in the tie, would get to break that tie, and oh, that's me tonight.

01:55:26.220 --> 01:55:30.780
My song only got one stinking vote, because your song sucks.

01:55:30.780 --> 01:55:34.460
That being said, this is a no-brainer.

01:55:34.460 --> 01:55:36.460
I vote for Jamie's.

01:55:36.460 --> 01:55:37.460
Yay!

01:55:37.460 --> 01:55:39.100
I know, let's pick another one.

01:55:39.100 --> 01:55:47.740
Loki, you the man, but that song is the suck, so I pick Little Flowers, this week's cage

01:55:47.740 --> 01:55:58.700
match winner for two weeks in a row so um enjoy i like the dog

01:55:58.700 --> 01:56:03.220
i was gonna pick something really shitty but i could not find that damn track for the life

01:56:03.220 --> 01:56:10.780
of me it was boys for love oh what boys for love and it was a song about being gay but

01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:16.820
i couldn't find it and it was really funny it's just like it's a ddr song i have i can't

01:56:16.820 --> 01:56:23.460
find it. I don't know where it went. Are you going to put it in your mix? I could, that

01:56:23.460 --> 01:56:37.740
would be funny. If I find it, maybe. All right. So, I think I'll take a break. When we come

01:56:37.740 --> 01:56:43.660
back, we'll do the FUs of the week. So send those over private message to Sky. Hi, I'm

01:56:43.660 --> 01:56:46.900
in the chat room and if you have something to bitch about, we're going to get it out

01:56:46.900 --> 01:56:52.900
in the open on this next break. In the meantime, we've done a tack break, we've done a taka

01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:58.900
break. I think now, like it or not, I think it's time to do Naoki break. What do you guys

01:56:58.900 --> 01:56:59.900
think?

01:56:59.900 --> 01:57:00.900
Cry.

01:57:00.900 --> 01:57:05.260
Don't cry. No, we're going to play some good Naoki stuff. So we will be right back after

01:57:05.260 --> 01:57:06.260
this break.

01:59:06.260 --> 01:59:09.260
Why did you have to go away?

01:59:09.260 --> 01:59:12.260
Always thought you'd stay

01:59:12.260 --> 01:59:17.260
And keep on going over, over you

01:59:17.260 --> 01:59:21.260
Tell me was it really true romance

01:59:21.260 --> 01:59:24.260
Or just fantasy

01:59:24.260 --> 01:59:27.260
I can't believe what we've been through

01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:30.260
You're hanging out with someone new

01:59:30.260 --> 01:59:33.260
Still you're in my heart, baby in my heart

01:59:33.260 --> 01:59:35.260
Always in my heart

01:59:35.260 --> 01:59:39.660
You'll never leave my heart till, till you've been my heart

01:59:39.660 --> 01:59:45.260
Feet down in my heart, fill me with ecstasy

01:59:45.260 --> 01:59:50.260
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

01:59:50.260 --> 01:59:53.260
Oh, baby, no, baby

01:59:53.260 --> 01:59:56.260
Can't take you down to me

01:59:56.260 --> 01:59:59.260
Was it just a fantasy?

01:59:59.260 --> 02:00:02.260
What I've done for fear in reality

02:00:02.260 --> 02:00:05.260
Oh baby, can't you just see

02:00:05.260 --> 02:00:07.260
That I can't go on

02:00:07.260 --> 02:00:10.260
Living without you

02:00:10.260 --> 02:00:13.260
Still, still you're in my heart

02:00:13.260 --> 02:00:14.260
Never leave my heart

02:00:14.260 --> 02:00:17.260
Now it's forever more

02:00:17.260 --> 02:00:19.260
Still, still you're in my heart

02:00:19.260 --> 02:00:21.260
Always in my heart

02:00:21.260 --> 02:00:27.260
When will I ever break free?

02:02:21.260 --> 02:02:33.100
Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

02:02:33.100 --> 02:02:37.260
is brought to you by the letter D, the letter A, and the number 59.

02:02:37.260 --> 02:02:42.900
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

02:02:42.900 --> 02:02:45.100
Hello everybody.

02:02:45.100 --> 02:02:47.140
It's time to do the FUs of the Week.

02:02:47.140 --> 02:02:50.260
Jamie, what are the FUs of the Week all about?

02:02:50.260 --> 02:02:57.260
We get pissed off and tell everybody

02:03:08.300 --> 02:03:12.540
My first F.U. of the week is a very important one

02:03:12.540 --> 02:03:16.020
F.U. to Adultery

02:03:16.020 --> 02:03:22.020
i'm not going to go into specifics about it because it involves a pretty good friend of mine

02:03:22.020 --> 02:03:23.620
um...

02:03:23.620 --> 02:03:25.900
but there's no

02:03:25.900 --> 02:03:27.900
excuse for it

02:03:27.900 --> 02:03:31.220
and i can't really

02:03:31.220 --> 02:03:35.020
vouch for anyone who goes through with it who is

02:03:35.020 --> 02:03:38.040
i'm not getting into details but just in general

02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:41.540
i can't i can't stand it

02:03:41.540 --> 02:03:43.260
next thing

02:03:43.260 --> 02:03:49.100
Um, F.U. to people who go ten miles under the speed limit in front of you.

02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:54.240
And then people who match your speed in the lane next to you so that you can't change lanes.

02:03:56.120 --> 02:04:02.700
Um, you know what, I'm not really all that angsty, because I'm still looking forward to my vacation.

02:04:03.500 --> 02:04:04.300
Mmm, casp.

02:04:04.300 --> 02:04:15.980
FU to probably not having reliable internet access while I'm in Alabama, but I'll do what

02:04:15.980 --> 02:04:16.980
I can.

02:04:16.980 --> 02:04:26.140
And of course, FU for no remote way of me contributing to the show.

02:04:26.140 --> 02:04:27.140
That's really about it.

02:04:27.140 --> 02:04:29.020
I did, however, notice something.

02:04:29.020 --> 02:04:36.420
Radio Shack logo looks remarkable like the battle royale logo. I think it's a government spot

02:04:39.180 --> 02:04:42.540
With remote-control cars batteries and walkman

02:04:44.300 --> 02:04:47.300
And cell phones a PCS for everybody, okay

02:04:48.980 --> 02:04:50.980
E.t. Salio

02:04:53.020 --> 02:04:55.360
All right, Loki you ready

02:04:55.360 --> 02:05:11.560
I got the mic actually yes I am no fuck you with stupid bastards at Golfland not

02:05:11.560 --> 02:05:15.160
necessarily people cuz you know people will be stupid and they'll flock no

02:05:15.160 --> 02:05:20.840
matter yes I'm saying the bastards working behind the snack counter at

02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:28.720
off land yesterday around 7pm. You suck because first off you have to go make a stupid comment

02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:32.840
about my shirt. Yes I know what my shirt says and the fact that you comment about it does

02:05:32.840 --> 02:05:38.660
not make you seem any more intelligent. I don't care if your friend is afraid of ninja

02:05:38.660 --> 02:05:46.320
monkeys or ninja squirrels or any ninja rodent of whatever the case may be. I don't care

02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:53.760
and I also don't care that you're out of the large cup size I want a soda give me a fucking soda

02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:59.200
and just because you're stupid enough to drop the piece of pizza on the floor

02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:05.520
and you give me the larger slice by calling this special piece of pizza I don't really care

02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:11.440
and the fact that you tried to give me the piece of pizza attached to the giant uh cardboard circle

02:06:11.440 --> 02:06:13.840
it was on there to begin with

02:06:13.840 --> 02:06:15.960
I won it on a fucking plate

02:06:15.960 --> 02:06:20.480
and you tried to get me on this giant piece of cardboard, what the hell am I supposed to do with that?

02:06:20.480 --> 02:06:23.320
this guy was a complete idiot

02:06:23.320 --> 02:06:27.800
not surprising, you were working at golf land

02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:29.920
um, other than that

02:06:29.920 --> 02:06:31.580
um

02:06:31.580 --> 02:06:35.280
I don't like the cold, so fuck you mother nature

02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:36.580
for making it cold

02:06:36.580 --> 02:06:39.660
all of a sudden, it was like ninety degrees one day

02:06:39.660 --> 02:06:41.580
And then it dropped down to 50.

02:06:41.580 --> 02:06:44.420
You can't just drop the temperature 40 degrees

02:06:44.420 --> 02:06:46.380
and expect anyone to not care.

02:06:49.540 --> 02:06:51.820
I have a comment to make.

02:06:51.820 --> 02:06:52.420
OK.

02:06:52.420 --> 02:06:55.260
I checked what the weather is in Alabama right now.

02:06:55.260 --> 02:06:59.140
And at nighttime, below is 66 degrees.

02:06:59.140 --> 02:06:59.700
That's cool.

02:07:02.500 --> 02:07:04.380
And fuck you to my bank, because I

02:07:04.380 --> 02:07:09.340
was overdrawn on my account for like $5, and they charged me 60.

02:07:09.340 --> 02:07:10.500
So, they suck.

02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:13.540
Sue them.

02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:15.140
I can't sue them.

02:07:15.140 --> 02:07:17.360
All you have to do is get a credit card with your bank.

02:07:18.020 --> 02:07:21.220
So, if you overdraft a post from your card and you're not charged any fines,

02:07:21.620 --> 02:07:22.820
you can just put it on your card.

02:07:22.820 --> 02:07:23.620
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

02:07:23.900 --> 02:07:25.480
See, I used to do that too.

02:07:25.480 --> 02:07:26.820
I used to have a credit card.

02:07:27.040 --> 02:07:28.140
That's a big mistake.

02:07:28.140 --> 02:07:31.100
Because not only do they charge you the $30 for overdrafting,

02:07:31.540 --> 02:07:34.180
they charge you a fee on your credit card too.

02:07:34.520 --> 02:07:36.060
It's just a big scam.

02:07:36.440 --> 02:07:37.140
So, I think the problem.

02:07:37.140 --> 02:07:38.420
What bank do you bank with?

02:07:38.420 --> 02:07:42.420
No, no wonder. Hell's Cargo.

02:07:42.420 --> 02:07:47.420
So anyways, yeah, they suck. But, um, whatever.

02:07:47.420 --> 02:07:51.420
So, I'm done.

02:07:51.420 --> 02:07:56.420
Alright.

02:07:56.420 --> 02:08:00.420
My FU this week is a real no-brainer for me, actually.

02:08:00.420 --> 02:08:05.420
Usually I have to sit here and think about what I'm going to say FU of the week to, uh, for a long time.

02:08:05.420 --> 02:08:09.580
for a long time, but this week it's easy because I got really pissed off

02:08:09.580 --> 02:08:15.100
at Final Fantasy XI earlier this week. So my nephew used to play online, the Sony people,

02:08:15.100 --> 02:08:20.260
because when you put in your credit card information, you can't put in a space bar.

02:08:20.260 --> 02:08:23.580
Your name is not allowed to have spaces.

02:08:23.580 --> 02:08:29.900
If you don't, I'm sorry, if you have a space in your name, you don't exist to

02:08:29.900 --> 02:08:31.300
the Final Fantasy people.

02:08:31.300 --> 02:08:36.300
So I had to call tech support and all that stuff and they don't take

02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:40.360
They won't register you over the phone at tech support for whatever reason

02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:42.680
I don't know why I'm sure if I bitch to wind enough

02:08:42.680 --> 02:08:45.680
They probably would have but luckily the guy and I were able to make it work somehow

02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:51.760
So I finally was able to get online the guy on the other end of the line at play online was actually very nice

02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:54.960
It was very good text customer service and tech support

02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:57.960
So it it helped ease my anger a little bit

02:08:57.960 --> 02:09:01.760
But whoever thought that one up to disable the space bar?

02:09:01.760 --> 02:09:03.720
Come on, why do you disable keys?

02:09:03.720 --> 02:09:05.320
You never know when somebody might need to use it.

02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:08.720
And for the record, I go by my middle name, actually.

02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:10.320
So I use my first initial.

02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:14.880
My bank has me in the system as my first initial space middle name.

02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:19.240
So I'm something space Robert in the system.

02:09:19.240 --> 02:09:21.240
So that's why.

02:09:21.240 --> 02:09:23.800
Yeah, I know you know, but we can keep it a secret.

02:09:23.800 --> 02:09:24.680
I promise.

02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:25.400
So.

02:09:25.400 --> 02:09:27.360
And it's a nice name for me.

02:09:27.360 --> 02:09:35.360
So screw you, who ever decided to come up with that disabling the space bar?

02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:38.360
We're out in hell.

02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:42.360
And it took me, also FU to file fantasy 11 because it took me about 5 hours to install.

02:09:42.360 --> 02:09:45.360
But once I got in there, oh fuck it's beautiful.

02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:49.360
I'm wondering if I installed the data I have.

02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:50.360
If it would work.

02:09:50.360 --> 02:09:54.360
Either way, you're going to have to sit there and download the 2 hour patch.

02:09:54.360 --> 02:09:57.360
I doubt it will work, but it's worth a try.

02:09:57.360 --> 02:09:58.360
It's worth it.

02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:00.360
You don't have to pay for anything.

02:10:00.360 --> 02:10:02.360
Cause I know there's people who already have.

02:10:02.360 --> 02:10:05.360
I think the beta people had to upgrade, I think.

02:10:05.360 --> 02:10:06.360
Stupid.

02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:09.360
Thank god for Ragnarok.

02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:10.360
Alright.

02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:14.360
End of the chatroom, FUs.

02:10:14.360 --> 02:10:16.360
Bag4U says,

02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:22.360
Hey Sky, send an FU to Konami for being anal about the 2DX release.

02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:24.360
agree that was kind of stupid of Konami

02:10:25.240 --> 02:10:31.920
23rd magus says if you to slow leveling in Ragnarok online f you to my DDR skills slipping

02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:36.420
I can't pass Sakura anymore and a big f you to concert tickets being so overpriced

02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:43.600
I'm sorry, but $30 a seat what you want to rate my wallet some more damn pay $30 is actually pretty cheap

02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:47.480
I was pricing the tickets for Alan Jackson in there 45 apiece

02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:51.360
you want to go see Elton John in Vegas prepare to pay a hundred dollars to the

02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:59.720
cheap seats crazy god it's just not so much some tickets cost John Fields would

02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:03.600
like to say F you to Microsoft your piece of shit software thinks my D drive

02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:07.400
is corrupt now I have to rebuild my computer while trying to save as many

02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:12.040
files as I can fuck you fuck you fuck you Microsoft and your XP OS fuck you to

02:11:12.040 --> 02:11:22.480
of twisting my ankle today oh and fuck you to Microsoft again you know what so

02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:25.600
when I install Final Fantasy 11 something similar happened to me where it was

02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:30.560
trying to boot for my disk drive I am Brad thank God Brad was here because he

02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:33.960
was able to fix it I wouldn't know what to do I would have broken down and cried

02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:41.320
at the $50 I would have wasted on nothing all right let's see Joe mama

02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:47.000
I would like to say my FU of the week is to the shitty PC controls for Final Fantasy 11.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:51.920
I got used to the PC controls myself but I received a tip from Lanky Style who was a

02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:53.440
beta tester for Final Fantasy 11.

02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:56.480
He says use a kinky joy, it makes it a lot easier.

02:11:56.480 --> 02:11:59.920
Get the Playstation controller hooked up to the computer and you'll enjoy Final Fantasy

02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:01.320
11 a lot more.

02:12:01.320 --> 02:12:03.560
I will try that in the future.

02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:08.040
Snub Disrenoid says fuck the children that didn't come to my house and left me with about

02:12:08.040 --> 02:12:13.040
five full pounds of Kit Kats, Twixes, and various other assorted candies.

02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:14.040
You're complaining?

02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:15.040
I'll take them.

02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:18.040
Now I have to eat all of this crap or throw it out.

02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:20.040
Thanks a lot you fucking overprotective parents.

02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:22.040
You're saving your kids but killing my bowels.

02:12:22.040 --> 02:12:24.040
Runs to bathroom to shit out chocolate.

02:12:24.040 --> 02:12:26.040
So that's lovely.

02:12:26.040 --> 02:12:29.040
Maybe I should have poisoned my candy to give those parents a real reason to keep their

02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:30.040
kids at home.

02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:32.040
Then you'd still be stuck with it and you'd just have to throw it away.

02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:33.040
God, it's wasted chocolate.

02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:34.040
I know.

02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:35.040
You know what?

02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:36.040
Take it to school.

02:12:36.040 --> 02:12:47.100
Wompo164 would like to say, fuck you to the Hot Topic raver wannabe 14 year olds who spend

02:12:47.100 --> 02:12:51.840
their entire weekend from Friday until Sunday at the malls arcade and causing me to not

02:12:51.840 --> 02:12:59.240
single digit grade exotic ethnic going from 4 grades within 15 seconds left to 14.

02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:04.240
T-underscore-T brought to you by me.

02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:09.240
Minst went home from college for the weekend, that's the basis of my F.U.

02:13:09.240 --> 02:13:16.240
F.U. to the local arcade, they now have a pump it up machine, it lags every time you hit an arrow and sometimes the song will just cut out.

02:13:16.240 --> 02:13:19.240
They should have gotten the second DDR machine they said they were going to get.

02:13:19.240 --> 02:13:22.240
Fuck you to it raining for 11 days straight over here.

02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:28.240
Maybe they don't miss the difference between pump it up and DDR.

02:13:28.240 --> 02:13:33.240
1. Zodiacknight would like to say I have no f**k you's because I love everyone equally.

02:13:33.240 --> 02:13:38.240
Awww, hairball. Sorry.

02:13:38.240 --> 02:13:46.240
2. Pixidust would like to say ok f**k this, I'm actually happy, I only have 3 f**k you's this week.

02:13:46.240 --> 02:13:51.240
3. F**k Bacardi151 and being drunk to the point where I passed out when I got home.

02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:58.140
Fuck dieting because I'm still the same damn weight and as always just because what if you wouldn't be complete without pixie dust saying

02:13:58.200 --> 02:14:03.760
Fuck having big boobs. I can't do step aerobics properly with these things flapping like two puppies

02:14:04.280 --> 02:14:06.280
Okay, I'm done and love you Rob. What?

02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:13.520
Love you, too. You know what and notice how no love for Jamie or Loki. It's all me. Oh, sure. I'm the best

02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:20.520
No, you know what? They make an exercise bra that's really good for big boob women.

02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:23.520
I used it for a little while.

02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:26.520
Boobs?

02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:31.520
Yes, Loki? What are you doing, Loki?

02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:35.520
I'm going to go to the next FU.

02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:37.520
There's something for someone to comment on.

02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:38.520
What?

02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:40.520
Oh, what do you want to comment on?

02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:42.520
BananaBoobs.com

02:14:42.520 --> 02:14:53.040
about the dieting thing, don't diet, do a lifestyle adjustment.

02:14:54.200 --> 02:14:54.980
That's, that's good.

02:14:56.520 --> 02:14:59.460
Oh, and she says, she says in the public chat room, love you, Jamie.

02:15:00.640 --> 02:15:02.080
Yay, we love you too.

02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:05.360
What's the link you're going to post?

02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:09.760
Some boob thing, some straight man thing.

02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:17.320
this game rocks and this is for you pixie disc frontal assault the ultimate boob game

02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:25.120
okay this game rocks okay it's just awesome DJ specter would like to say fuck you to max

02:15:30.300 --> 02:15:34.840
suck get over it uh DJ specter would also like to say fuck you to my fucking asshole

02:15:34.840 --> 02:15:42.000
a Spanish teacher that I have. You know my Spanish 2 teacher, my least favorite teacher

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:45.880
of all, no my second least favorite teacher of all time. You know what Rob? What? I never

02:15:45.880 --> 02:15:57.280
took Spanish. I took French and Japanese at the same time. Como te llama? Fuego! El telefono

02:15:57.280 --> 02:15:58.280
Luce libre!

02:15:58.280 --> 02:16:07.280
Just like all the words in Spanish right there, Luce libre and last F U.

02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:08.280
Telemundo.

02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:12.560
Wampa164 would like to say, fuck Halloween for being a shitty holiday that's more of

02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:16.320
an excuse for people to vandalize people's houses and property by teenagers.

02:16:16.320 --> 02:16:18.280
Well, that's the best recipe.

02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:19.280
The end.

02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:20.280
Are they ever?

02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:21.280
What the fuck is this?

02:16:21.280 --> 02:16:28.880
I love Loki too, but don't tell Nellie.

02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:37.200
As Loki brings up the world domination of the boob game that Jamie is watching, it's

02:16:37.200 --> 02:16:46.240
this giant pair of tits that you kind of use your hand to kind of throw.

02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:50.360
It's kind of like DDR in a way because these little things scroll down the screen and you

02:16:50.360 --> 02:16:52.260
have to do the steps.

02:16:52.260 --> 02:16:53.660
You have to do tricks with the boobs.

02:16:53.660 --> 02:16:56.300
Like you either have to swing them one way, or you do like a

02:16:56.300 --> 02:16:58.920
spiral, or you have to just bounce them up and down.

02:16:58.920 --> 02:17:00.180
It's all very interesting.

02:17:03.220 --> 02:17:04.460
I swear.

02:17:06.220 --> 02:17:07.180
OK.

02:17:07.180 --> 02:17:09.700
As Jamie is fascinated by the boob game.

02:17:09.700 --> 02:17:10.940
This game is stupid.

02:17:14.620 --> 02:17:16.620
I think what we'll do is we'll take another break.

02:17:16.620 --> 02:17:17.180
Eh?

02:17:17.180 --> 02:17:17.860
Eh?

02:17:17.860 --> 02:17:18.720
OK.

02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:22.160
And this break is going to be an LED break.

02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:23.240
Somebody suggested to me.

02:17:23.240 --> 02:17:25.520
I forgot who, but I'm sure they'll be happy to hear that.

02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:29.020
We're going to do an LED break, because LED is awesome.

02:17:29.020 --> 02:17:31.760
And we need to hear some more LED songs, so we're going to

02:17:31.760 --> 02:17:34.320
play some right now for you guys.

02:17:34.320 --> 02:17:36.520
So enjoy this break, and we'll be back.

02:17:36.520 --> 02:17:39.480
And we're going to do a list list when we come back, yes?

02:17:39.480 --> 02:17:40.040
Yes.

02:17:40.040 --> 02:17:40.600
All right.

02:17:40.600 --> 02:17:47.600
we'll do that

02:18:40.600 --> 02:19:08.600
Don't you ever let me go Don't you ever let me go

02:19:08.600 --> 02:19:12.600
The

02:19:12.600 --> 02:19:16.600
The

02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:20.600
The

02:19:20.600 --> 02:19:24.600
The

02:19:24.600 --> 02:19:28.600
The

02:19:28.600 --> 02:19:32.600
The

02:19:32.600 --> 02:19:36.600
The

02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:38.600
You

02:20:06.600 --> 02:20:09.520
I'm sick of all your pieces, mama

02:20:09.520 --> 02:20:12.180
Well, I like your good, good, good, good

02:20:12.180 --> 02:20:14.220
But I'm just in the sky

02:20:14.220 --> 02:20:17.660
Oh, yeah, no, no, no, no

02:20:17.660 --> 02:20:20.280
I'm just gonna go and find my way

02:20:20.280 --> 02:20:26.740
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah

02:20:26.740 --> 02:20:31.620
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah

02:24:01.620 --> 02:24:06.620
.

02:24:06.620 --> 02:24:11.620
.

02:24:11.620 --> 02:24:16.640
.

02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:21.640
.

02:24:21.640 --> 02:24:26.640
.

02:24:56.640 --> 02:25:24.640
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge radio staff meeting.

02:25:24.640 --> 02:25:30.760
Xtreme Bimani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:25:30.760 --> 02:25:34.920
You know what's funny is that promo predates DDRXtreme.

02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:42.280
That promo was when, that was made right before the second show, because I was gone for the

02:25:42.280 --> 02:25:43.920
second and third shows.

02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:46.160
I was in Alabama.

02:25:46.160 --> 02:25:50.440
I swear to God when you get back from Alabama before season 4 premieres we're going to sit

02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:53.880
down and do new promos for season 4 and that's going to be our treat to everybody.

02:25:53.880 --> 02:25:57.680
Well, I'm back the whole Wednesday with nothing going on.

02:25:57.680 --> 02:25:58.680
Well, yeah.

02:25:58.680 --> 02:25:59.680
We'll see what we can do.

02:25:59.680 --> 02:26:00.680
Get together.

02:26:00.680 --> 02:26:01.680
All right.

02:26:01.680 --> 02:26:04.480
As promised, tonight we're going to do a list list, and earlier in the show we said we wanted

02:26:04.480 --> 02:26:08.800
to do a game they should most make a movie out of, but we put our brains together and

02:26:08.800 --> 02:26:13.680
we could swear that somewhere in the history of Warren Tontroy we have done the topic before.

02:26:13.680 --> 02:26:20.560
I'm almost positive Castlevania came out on top when we did that list, because I remember

02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:25.880
Somebody said Guardian Legend, because Guardian Legend comes up on every list, and something

02:26:25.880 --> 02:26:26.880
like that.

02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:31.160
So I'm almost positive that was done before, so we decided to shelve it, and instead we

02:26:31.160 --> 02:26:36.960
thought we'd go the other way around and say movie they most need to make a game out of.

02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:39.960
So we haven't done listless in a long, long time, so I'm going to explain how this works.

02:26:39.960 --> 02:26:41.640
This is excluding ones that have already been done, by the way.

02:26:41.640 --> 02:26:43.640
Yes, excluding ones that have already been done.

02:26:43.640 --> 02:26:46.160
Or similar, because that lights a calf of mine.

02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:49.800
Yeah, because, well, I kind of put one that they did have a game a long time ago, but

02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:50.500
need a new one.

02:26:51.620 --> 02:26:52.920
So, cheater.

02:26:52.920 --> 02:26:54.000
Anyway, yeah I cheated.

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.720
Deal with it.

02:26:56.720 --> 02:26:59.320
Basically, the way this works is that we're going to go

02:26:59.320 --> 02:26:59.880
around the room.

02:26:59.880 --> 02:27:01.400
And we're going to name our top fours.

02:27:01.400 --> 02:27:03.760
There's only three of us, and I usually only do top three.

02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:05.240
But since there's only three of us here tonight, we're going

02:27:05.240 --> 02:27:07.140
to do our top four list.

02:27:07.140 --> 02:27:09.200
And then we're going to have our big list, the definitive

02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:11.880
list, and then we'll go around.

02:27:11.880 --> 02:27:14.320
And the fun part is, we each take one off.

02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:16.480
One that we feel is not deserving to be there.

02:27:16.480 --> 02:27:17.900
It really shouldn't be there, so we're going to take one

02:27:17.900 --> 02:27:18.560
off.

02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:20.840
Then the chat room gets the ultimate say.

02:27:20.840 --> 02:27:24.880
The chat room gets to vote on the definitive top three list.

02:27:24.880 --> 02:27:29.880
Tonight's topic, movie they most need to make a game out of.

02:27:29.880 --> 02:27:32.600
So here we go.

02:27:32.600 --> 02:27:35.120
First up, we have, what do you want to start, Jamie?

02:27:35.120 --> 02:27:35.600
Sure.

02:27:35.600 --> 02:27:37.640
All right, Jamie, your number four pick for tonight.

02:27:37.640 --> 02:27:41.680
The number four should be The Never Ending Story.

02:27:41.680 --> 02:27:43.280
Make it an RPG.

02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:45.440
Any reason why a never ending story?

02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:48.840
just

02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:50.560
because it would have a kick-ass theme song

02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:55.960
yes, fight. Dear God I hope... I want the whole... I want a whole...

02:27:55.960 --> 02:27:57.000
Ring then!

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:58.880
Okay then take that off the list

02:27:58.880 --> 02:28:01.560
on PC, PC games don't count. Okay, take it off.

02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:03.840
Do a labyrinth.

02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:07.560
I know they had a labyrinth game on Converse 64, but that could be one of those really old

02:28:07.560 --> 02:28:09.480
games that needs to be updated.

02:28:09.480 --> 02:28:12.480
Okay. Alright, labyrinth.

02:28:12.480 --> 02:28:14.980
Because then that means Rendered David Bullies.

02:28:14.980 --> 02:28:15.480
Exactly.

02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:15.980
Alright.

02:28:16.480 --> 02:28:16.980
Okay.

02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:19.480
Nobody played it.

02:28:19.480 --> 02:28:21.480
It was on Commodore 64, nobody played it.

02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:22.480
Yeah.

02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:23.480
Um, anyways.

02:28:23.480 --> 02:28:23.980
Loki.

02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:24.980
Um.

02:28:25.480 --> 02:28:28.480
My pick is going to be, um.

02:28:28.980 --> 02:28:30.480
God, there's so many.

02:28:32.980 --> 02:28:34.980
I'm gonna have to go with Showgirls.

02:28:35.480 --> 02:28:36.480
Because, um.

02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:37.980
You.

02:28:38.480 --> 02:28:39.480
I can see it now.

02:28:39.480 --> 02:28:41.480
You're struggling to get to the top of the world.

02:28:41.480 --> 02:28:46.240
You know do whatever it takes. It's a story about survival. I

02:28:47.160 --> 02:28:49.160
like that I did that sounds like you could be a

02:28:49.480 --> 02:28:55.720
It would just be a really emotional kind of game with a really great back story. You don't know shit. You don't know shit

02:28:56.680 --> 02:29:01.320
One of my very favorite movies of all time a pick close to my heart Loki. Thank you

02:29:02.240 --> 02:29:03.080
All right

02:29:03.080 --> 02:29:09.960
My number four pick is a game that it actually did have a game back in the 80s and they even

02:29:09.960 --> 02:29:13.960
updated it somewhat recently, but all it was was a newer version of the 80s game, and it

02:29:13.960 --> 02:29:18.960
sucks. I want them to just scrap it all and do a new one. The Rocky Horror Picture Show.

02:29:18.960 --> 02:29:23.960
They did a game? They did a game, and it sucks ass, so they need a new one. What was this

02:29:23.960 --> 02:29:29.960
on? It was on Apple IIe, and then they did an updated version of it not too long ago,

02:29:29.960 --> 02:29:33.960
but it was just an updated version of it. It sucked. They need to totally just scrap

02:29:33.960 --> 02:29:38.960
the concept and do a new one. I'm going to give them a do-over. And technically it's

02:29:38.960 --> 02:29:40.840
It's a game based on the play.

02:29:40.840 --> 02:29:42.920
It's a Rocky Horror Show game.

02:29:42.920 --> 02:29:45.880
So they haven't done the game for the Rocky Horror Picture

02:29:45.880 --> 02:29:46.520
Show.

02:29:46.520 --> 02:29:48.120
So that's my loophole.

02:29:48.120 --> 02:29:50.040
So it'll be just a couple of songs there.

02:29:54.320 --> 02:29:56.520
My number four pick is the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

02:29:56.520 --> 02:29:57.200
All right.

02:29:57.200 --> 02:29:58.520
My number three.

02:29:58.520 --> 02:29:59.520
Number three, Jamie.

02:29:59.520 --> 02:30:03.680
Is Monty Python and the Holy Grail RPG.

02:30:03.680 --> 02:30:08.880
Just think of the potential, especially with the

02:30:08.880 --> 02:30:13.080
I did a Terry Gilliam doing all the artwork for it.

02:30:13.080 --> 02:30:14.480
It'd be awesome.

02:30:14.480 --> 02:30:15.000
It'd be awesome.

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:15.560
I'd love it.

02:30:15.560 --> 02:30:18.140
And, of course, they need to insert the one-on-one

02:30:18.140 --> 02:30:19.100
with the Black Knight.

02:30:19.100 --> 02:30:21.720
The Ministry of Coconuts, you know, little snippet of it.

02:30:21.720 --> 02:30:22.840
It could be a rhythm game.

02:30:22.840 --> 02:30:25.400
Proper use of the coconut.

02:30:25.400 --> 02:30:27.320
That could be a special controller.

02:30:27.320 --> 02:30:29.520
You'd play as, what was his squire's name?

02:30:29.520 --> 02:30:30.320
Patsy.

02:30:30.320 --> 02:30:30.820
Yep.

02:30:30.820 --> 02:30:32.320
And then you can eat the minstrels.

02:30:32.320 --> 02:30:33.680
Message for yourself.

02:30:33.680 --> 02:30:35.800
You can eat the minstrels.

02:30:35.800 --> 02:30:37.120
And that was much rejoicing.

02:30:37.120 --> 02:30:38.480
Yay.

02:30:38.480 --> 02:30:43.160
Loki, your number three pick, a newer one that just came to my head right now.

02:30:44.680 --> 02:30:46.440
Orgazmo, the video game.

02:30:47.680 --> 02:30:49.280
What would be a first person shooter?

02:30:49.480 --> 02:30:52.900
Now you're a man, man, man, man.

02:30:53.540 --> 02:30:55.740
Oh my, I will let you borrow my tape.

02:30:55.740 --> 02:30:56.700
I have a tape somewhere.

02:30:56.900 --> 02:30:57.620
I have a tape.

02:30:58.200 --> 02:31:00.160
Let the woman borrow it so she can see it.

02:31:00.240 --> 02:31:02.340
Okay. Go ahead.

02:31:03.560 --> 02:31:04.300
Oh, it's great.

02:31:04.300 --> 02:31:06.260
All right, Orgazmo the game, good idea.

02:31:06.260 --> 02:31:11.240
All right, my number three pick is probably a small movie you may not have heard of,

02:31:11.240 --> 02:31:14.320
but those that have seen it know why this needs to be a video game.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:16.700
Pink Flamingos, the game.

02:31:19.560 --> 02:31:22.840
Pink Flamingos is a John Waters early movie.

02:31:22.840 --> 02:31:26.460
It's one of the most disgusting films ever made, and it's about two people,

02:31:26.740 --> 02:31:30.040
or I should say three people, because there's a couple, and Divine, of course,

02:31:30.040 --> 02:31:32.580
in one of her best roles ever, they're in a competition

02:31:32.580 --> 02:31:34.580
to be the filthiest person in the world.

02:31:34.580 --> 02:31:39.360
And imagine if you could participate in that competition to be the filthiest person in the world.

02:31:39.560 --> 02:31:41.860
And at the end, like the last stage, you can eat dog shit.

02:31:42.860 --> 02:31:45.160
I just had an odd thought.

02:31:45.360 --> 02:31:45.640
What?

02:31:47.240 --> 02:31:50.220
They've made the creative machine that merges two people into one.

02:31:50.940 --> 02:31:53.080
And so they take John Waters and John Hughes.

02:31:55.280 --> 02:31:55.780
Imagine.

02:31:55.780 --> 02:31:57.060
They just get hairspray.

02:31:57.460 --> 02:31:57.860
Oh, yeah.

02:31:57.980 --> 02:31:59.260
All right.

02:31:59.260 --> 02:32:01.380
Anyway, your number three pick, Jamie.

02:32:01.380 --> 02:32:01.840
My number three pick.

02:32:01.840 --> 02:32:02.660
I'm sorry, your number two pick.

02:32:02.660 --> 02:32:05.660
My number two pick is Kill Bill.

02:32:05.660 --> 02:32:09.660
Having to go through your enemies, and then all the fight scenes play like Bushido Blade.

02:32:09.660 --> 02:32:11.660
God damn you, that was my number one.

02:32:11.660 --> 02:32:12.660
Bitch.

02:32:12.660 --> 02:32:14.660
You better not take my number one or I'll kick your ass.

02:32:14.660 --> 02:32:15.660
Alright.

02:32:15.660 --> 02:32:17.660
You know what my number one is.

02:32:17.660 --> 02:32:18.660
I can guess.

02:32:18.660 --> 02:32:20.660
Loki.

02:32:20.660 --> 02:32:24.660
Oh, this one should be easy.

02:32:24.660 --> 02:32:31.660
The Oral Adventures of Kravenmoorhead.

02:32:31.660 --> 02:32:37.660
I can see this one playing out like Commander Keen or something like that.

02:32:39.660 --> 02:32:41.660
It's a porno movie, folks!

02:32:42.660 --> 02:32:49.660
But hey, it's got 17 videos already. With a franchise that large, it needs a game.

02:32:51.660 --> 02:32:52.660
I mean...

02:32:52.660 --> 02:32:54.660
Alright, fair enough.

02:32:54.660 --> 02:32:56.660
My number two pick...

02:32:56.660 --> 02:32:57.660
Right...

02:32:57.660 --> 02:33:01.660
My number two pick is a movie you probably have never seen, but I'll explain it for you.

02:33:01.660 --> 02:33:04.660
It's Trick, the game.

02:33:06.660 --> 02:33:11.660
Trick is a nice little piece of gay cinema that's about two guys that just run into each other on the subway

02:33:11.660 --> 02:33:14.660
that are trying desperately to find a place to fuck.

02:33:14.660 --> 02:33:17.660
And I'm thinking this will make an exciting video game.

02:33:17.660 --> 02:33:19.660
It could be like one of those stealth games.

02:33:19.660 --> 02:33:21.660
Have you ever played Thief? That could be it.

02:33:21.660 --> 02:33:24.660
It could be like, we've got to find a place to screw right now.

02:33:24.660 --> 02:33:26.660
And there's a time limit and everything.

02:33:26.660 --> 02:33:30.420
trick the game and who could even have a cameo from Tori Spelling just like the

02:33:30.420 --> 02:33:35.900
movie did be beautiful so I trick the game is my number two pick my number one

02:33:35.900 --> 02:33:40.460
yes you're number one now I was thinking of scanners but then again there was

02:33:40.460 --> 02:33:44.460
Galerians where you have people thinking of people hard enough that makes her

02:33:44.460 --> 02:33:50.420
heads explode they already did that and all kinds of others I figured in keeping

02:33:50.420 --> 02:33:55.980
with because it's me right would have battle royale of course game and it

02:33:55.980 --> 02:34:00.380
would work and make it like you have survival horror mode or you have

02:34:00.380 --> 02:34:05.880
multiplayer mode and your friends if you've got xbox put it on xbox network

02:34:05.880 --> 02:34:12.180
those bad boys you could have the whole classroom who would win think about it

02:34:12.180 --> 02:34:18.520
excellent catch all right like your number one pick for gay or movie that

02:34:18.520 --> 02:34:23.460
most needs to be a game no one except for maybe the people in the studio have

02:34:23.460 --> 02:34:29.780
actually seen this movie since it's that awful but it needs a game and I will put

02:34:29.780 --> 02:34:35.340
the picture up on the cam it is cheerleader ninja yeah cheerleader

02:34:35.340 --> 02:34:40.220
ninjas I would love to see a game for this

02:34:42.900 --> 02:34:48.480
awesome any other can you briefly explain what this movie is about for

02:34:48.480 --> 02:34:51.820
those that may not have seen it it's about these cheerleaders who are being

02:34:51.820 --> 02:34:58.100
blamed for smut on the internet and they have to fight these nuns and there's

02:34:58.100 --> 02:35:03.580
this gay guy who's like the head no person of their group or whatever of the

02:35:03.580 --> 02:35:07.900
nun group and he's just pissed off because because he never got he never

02:35:07.900 --> 02:35:13.340
got into the cheerleading squad and it's just it's so horrible and the movie has

02:35:13.340 --> 02:35:19.180
all the stunt doubles are blow-up dolls and it's just great it's a great great

02:35:19.180 --> 02:35:22.220
Great, great B movie.

02:35:22.220 --> 02:35:24.940
I'm not sure if this movie had a...

02:35:24.940 --> 02:35:29.060
Jamie took my number one, so I'm having a stretch here, but I'm thinking the more I

02:35:29.060 --> 02:35:30.060
think about it, this would be an awesome game.

02:35:30.060 --> 02:35:31.060
It may have already had one.

02:35:31.060 --> 02:35:32.060
I don't know though.

02:35:32.060 --> 02:35:34.060
Did Starship Troopers have a game?

02:35:34.060 --> 02:35:35.060
Yes.

02:35:35.060 --> 02:35:36.060
Damn it.

02:35:36.060 --> 02:35:38.060
It was a 3D first person shooter game.

02:35:38.060 --> 02:35:39.700
Damn it, damn it, damn it.

02:35:39.700 --> 02:35:40.700
I got one.

02:35:40.700 --> 02:35:43.100
You can do contact the game.

02:35:43.100 --> 02:35:44.100
No.

02:35:44.100 --> 02:35:48.420
You play through the whole game and you find out the end boss is just her dad, and I don't

02:35:48.420 --> 02:35:52.420
Fuck that. No contact the game. I don't want that to happen.

02:35:52.420 --> 02:35:54.420
Geely the game. You struggle to keep your...

02:35:54.420 --> 02:35:57.420
No. No Geely the game either. I need more ideas.

02:35:57.420 --> 02:35:59.420
I think, I think, um...

02:35:59.420 --> 02:36:03.420
I'm liking the idea of Jay and Silent Bob strike back the game.

02:36:03.420 --> 02:36:05.420
I was gonna say that.

02:36:05.420 --> 02:36:07.420
Or better yet, Clerks. Let's do Clerks.

02:36:07.420 --> 02:36:08.420
Clerks the game.

02:36:08.420 --> 02:36:09.420
That was on my list.

02:36:09.420 --> 02:36:10.420
That was on my list.

02:36:10.420 --> 02:36:12.420
We're gonna do Clerks the game.

02:36:12.420 --> 02:36:14.420
I'm not even supposed to be in this game.

02:36:14.420 --> 02:36:16.420
I'm not even supposed to play this today.

02:36:16.420 --> 02:36:19.420
That could be the tagline, it could be beautiful.

02:36:19.420 --> 02:36:22.420
Or it could be like a sports game, Clerks Rooftop Hockey.

02:36:22.420 --> 02:36:23.420
Yes!

02:36:23.420 --> 02:36:25.420
It's a collection of mini games.

02:36:25.420 --> 02:36:28.420
But you can get the alternate ending.

02:36:28.420 --> 02:36:30.420
Oh.

02:36:30.420 --> 02:36:33.420
Where everyone dies.

02:36:33.420 --> 02:36:34.420
Wasn't that what happened?

02:36:34.420 --> 02:36:35.420
Well, he got shot.

02:36:35.420 --> 02:36:36.420
Oh, he just got shot.

02:36:36.420 --> 02:36:37.420
The original ending.

02:36:37.420 --> 02:36:38.420
Alright.

02:36:38.420 --> 02:36:39.420
So here we are.

02:36:39.420 --> 02:36:40.420
This is the list we have so far.

02:36:40.420 --> 02:36:42.420
Next up is the elimination round.

02:36:42.420 --> 02:37:01.420
We have Labyrinth, Showgirls, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Orgazmo, Pink Flamingos, Kill Bill, The Oral Adventures of Kraven Moorhead, Trick, Battle Royale, Cheerleader Ninjas, and Clerks.

02:37:01.420 --> 02:37:09.420
Jamie, what has to come off this list?

02:37:09.420 --> 02:37:14.900
I'm sorry, but I don't see how that could be made into a game.

02:37:14.900 --> 02:37:15.900
Jamie!

02:37:15.900 --> 02:37:16.900
You're killing me!

02:37:16.900 --> 02:37:20.260
Unless it played like the Spice Girls game, which sucks.

02:37:20.260 --> 02:37:22.260
You're killing me, Jamie.

02:37:22.260 --> 02:37:23.380
It could be a dance game.

02:37:23.380 --> 02:37:27.180
They would never be able to do it justice.

02:37:27.180 --> 02:37:28.180
You're right, you're right.

02:37:28.180 --> 02:37:29.980
They could never do it justice.

02:37:29.980 --> 02:37:30.980
You're right.

02:37:30.980 --> 02:37:31.980
Thank you.

02:37:31.980 --> 02:37:32.980
I'm okay with that pick now, Jamie.

02:37:32.980 --> 02:37:33.980
Okay.

02:37:33.980 --> 02:37:35.980
Loki, your turn to take something off the list.

02:37:35.980 --> 02:37:39.980
Here comes Loki, here comes Loki.

02:37:39.980 --> 02:37:42.980
A glass of something, is that blood?

02:37:42.980 --> 02:37:47.980
Yes, the blood of all fruit.

02:37:47.980 --> 02:37:50.980
It's tropical punch blood.

02:37:50.980 --> 02:37:52.980
Okay, anyways.

02:37:52.980 --> 02:37:55.980
Loki, what's coming off the list?

02:37:55.980 --> 02:37:56.980
Painful Mingos.

02:37:56.980 --> 02:37:57.980
You bitch.

02:37:57.980 --> 02:37:58.980
That's gone.

02:37:58.980 --> 02:38:06.980
I like the idea of Trick as a survival horror game, but I thought it was like a stealth game, but as painful amigos, I can't do that.

02:38:06.980 --> 02:38:08.980
Alright, you bastard.

02:38:08.980 --> 02:38:18.980
You know what? I'm sorry, but The Oral Adventures of Craven Moorhead, it's way too obscure. I'm letting cheerleader ninjas slip by, for God's sake.

02:38:18.980 --> 02:38:20.980
The cheerleader ninjas would own it.

02:38:20.980 --> 02:38:26.980
The Oral Adventures of Craven Moorhead is just a little too out there. It's a little too out there, so I'm going to have to take that off.

02:38:26.980 --> 02:38:31.600
that off okay so here's what's left you guys you get to read it I get to post it

02:38:31.600 --> 02:38:34.420

Anyway, who was it that played her?

02:38:58.600 --> 02:38:59.740
Jennifer Connelly.

02:38:59.740 --> 02:39:00.540
Yeah, Jennifer Connelly.

02:39:01.400 --> 02:39:02.860
Next up.

02:39:02.860 --> 02:39:06.200
I hope, just sorry to interrupt, but I hope Zex and Shadda is listening

02:39:06.200 --> 02:39:09.460
because there is nothing better in this world than Labyrinth for him.

02:39:10.960 --> 02:39:14.040
Labyrinth is, okay, I picked up the Superbit edition.

02:39:14.100 --> 02:39:16.980
I think he would come in, if he's listening, I know he's going to come

02:39:16.980 --> 02:39:18.780
in the chat room for once just to vote for that.

02:39:19.540 --> 02:39:20.920
Well, that'd be cleans up after himself.

02:39:20.920 --> 02:39:33.640
Next up, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Tim Curry, Best Singing Voice Ever, The Tattoo, and The

02:39:33.640 --> 02:39:34.640
Guy Grunting.

02:39:34.640 --> 02:39:42.160
Anyway, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Polka Dots, Unladen Swallow.

02:39:42.160 --> 02:39:45.160
What is your speed of all Stephen, Unladen Swallow?

02:39:45.160 --> 02:39:47.160
Was it Africans Swallow or Europeans Swallow?

02:39:47.160 --> 02:39:49.160
I don't know.

02:39:49.160 --> 02:39:50.160
Anyway.

02:39:50.160 --> 02:39:59.920
What was the guy's name who ran the sushi bar?

02:39:59.920 --> 02:40:00.920
Sushi Fresh?

02:40:00.920 --> 02:40:01.920
Or something?

02:40:01.920 --> 02:40:02.920
G-Fresh.

02:40:02.920 --> 02:40:03.920
It's all about G-Fresh.

02:40:03.920 --> 02:40:06.920
Kill Bill.

02:40:06.920 --> 02:40:11.680
Uma Thurman with a sword and being able to do wire work.

02:40:11.680 --> 02:40:14.800
That was really impressive.

02:40:14.800 --> 02:40:21.800
Kuriyama Chiaki as Go! Go! Yubari with her swinging ball of doom, and Sunny Chiba, speaking

02:40:23.140 --> 02:40:30.140
very bad English. Your Japanese is good! Anyway, um, Chick, fuck if I know.

02:40:33.900 --> 02:40:36.900
It's about two gay guys who are trying to find a place to screw.

02:40:36.900 --> 02:40:41.900
I was making a mistake. Oh, okay. Oh, fuck if I know, I get it. Okay,

02:40:41.900 --> 02:40:42.840
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

02:40:42.840 --> 02:40:44.440
Battle royale, dead children.

02:40:44.880 --> 02:40:47.480
And beat Takeshi.

02:40:47.780 --> 02:40:49.920
Children ninjas.

02:40:51.340 --> 02:40:52.000
Blow up dolls.

02:40:53.260 --> 02:40:53.800
Pretty much.

02:40:54.540 --> 02:40:55.280
And clerks.

02:40:55.920 --> 02:40:56.820
And girls who fart.

02:40:58.680 --> 02:40:59.080
And nerds.

02:40:59.440 --> 02:40:59.820
And nerds.

02:41:00.520 --> 02:41:01.020
And clerks.

02:41:02.600 --> 02:41:03.980
That's not supposed to be here today.

02:41:04.860 --> 02:41:06.480
And rooftops, uh, hockey.

02:41:08.120 --> 02:41:09.560
Those are your choices.

02:41:09.560 --> 02:41:10.700
Send those votes now.

02:41:10.700 --> 02:41:13.700
Oh, and Death By Cocksucking.

02:41:15.040 --> 02:41:16.240
Yes, Death By Cocksucking.

02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:17.620
And The Airplane Story.

02:41:18.340 --> 02:41:22.380
All right, while those votes come in, we're going to take our last break of the night.

02:41:22.380 --> 02:41:24.800
Any requests what we're going to do this break?

02:41:24.800 --> 02:41:26.780
We want to do the anothers this break, right?

02:41:27.040 --> 02:41:28.140
Okay, we're going to do the anothers.

02:41:28.400 --> 02:41:32.600
So thank you, Zodiac Night, for saving my ass and sending this song to me.

02:41:33.140 --> 02:41:33.740
Here it is.

02:41:33.740 --> 02:41:39.760
Enjoy during this break while we tally the listless votes for a movie that you would most

02:41:39.760 --> 02:41:41.080
like to see a video game made out of.

02:41:41.080 --> 02:41:48.080
the definitive list coming back when we come back

02:42:11.080 --> 02:42:15.080
...

02:42:15.080 --> 02:42:19.080
...

02:42:19.080 --> 02:42:23.080
...

02:42:23.080 --> 02:42:27.080
...

02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:31.080
...

02:42:31.080 --> 02:42:35.080
...

02:42:35.080 --> 02:42:39.080
...

02:45:09.080 --> 02:45:29.000
This is fucked up!

02:46:09.080 --> 02:46:16.080
Oh, this is bad.

02:46:16.080 --> 02:46:22.080
Fucked up.

02:46:22.080 --> 02:46:29.080
This is fucked up This is fucked up

02:46:52.080 --> 02:47:21.080
I know the suspense is killing you but here it is the definitive list as decided by us

02:47:21.080 --> 02:47:23.720
Loki, Clark, and Skye.

02:47:23.720 --> 02:47:26.400
And a little help from the chat room.

02:47:26.400 --> 02:47:30.520
www.calibilmani.com, click on Orange Lounge and click on chat.

02:47:30.520 --> 02:47:32.800
All right, here it is.

02:47:32.800 --> 02:47:38.520
The top three movies you would like to see made into a game.

02:47:38.520 --> 02:47:42.560
Number three, Kill Bill.

02:47:42.560 --> 02:47:45.720
A lot of people, when they were voting, said, you know, I was going to vote for

02:47:45.720 --> 02:47:48.460
Kill Bill, but I think they're going to make that into a game anyway.

02:47:48.460 --> 02:47:49.560
You guys are probably right.

02:47:49.560 --> 02:47:53.400
I would say on this entire list, Kill Bill is the one I think is most likely going to

02:47:53.400 --> 02:47:54.400
be a game, if anything.

02:47:54.400 --> 02:47:55.400
We'll see.

02:47:55.400 --> 02:47:58.480
But Tarantino is such a big nerd that I could see it happening.

02:47:58.480 --> 02:48:01.080
So, but Kill Bill is your number three pick.

02:48:01.080 --> 02:48:05.000
But there were two films on this list you want to see even more than Kill Bill.

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:09.000
And number two is Clerks.

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:10.000
Clerks the Game.

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:15.800
Yep, so you guys want to just be lazy in your video games as well as your real life, I guess.

02:48:15.800 --> 02:48:18.000
Because there wouldn't be a lot to do in Clerks the Game.

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:23.000
The animated series would be fun, I think. So, there it is, Clerks the Game.

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:29.000
And your number one pick, I think this is pretty much a no-brainer, you guys, Battle Royale the Game.

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:38.000
Best, I mean this could be a Doom killer right here. Fuck Quake, Fuck Doom, Battle Royale would be where it's at.

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
I don't know, so they should make a Quake mod.

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:47.000
I talked to someone who was actually trying to do an encounter strike, but of course it wasn't really going to work.

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:50.480
So there you go, the list has decided by you and us.

02:48:50.480 --> 02:48:51.520
There's no disputing it.

02:48:51.520 --> 02:48:52.160
That is it.

02:48:52.160 --> 02:48:56.640
That's the list of movies that most need to be a game.

02:48:56.640 --> 02:48:59.800
OK, so now that we're back, we haven't even really

02:48:59.800 --> 02:49:03.960
referenced this yet in the show, but Loki would like to

02:49:03.960 --> 02:49:07.800
share with you this new game he downloaded this week.

02:49:07.800 --> 02:49:12.000
And Loki, you want to tell us a little more about this?

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.880
First off, the chair is being attacked by the microphone

02:49:14.880 --> 02:49:17.260
again

02:49:17.260 --> 02:49:19.300
maybe that should be a movie or a game

02:49:19.300 --> 02:49:25.820
attack of the killer microphone cord

02:49:25.820 --> 02:49:26.700
you ok there?

02:49:26.700 --> 02:49:28.140
you need some help?

02:49:28.140 --> 02:49:31.620
you gonna make it?

02:49:31.620 --> 02:49:34.700
you're just in the middle of traffic i think is what happens to it

02:49:34.700 --> 02:49:41.700
i was the one sitting in it and i didn't do anything she was spinning around and around and around

02:49:41.700 --> 02:49:43.700
Okay.

02:49:43.700 --> 02:49:49.700
You're okay, Loki. You gonna make it? You gonna be okay? Alright, he's ready. He's ready to tell you all about the game.

02:49:49.700 --> 02:49:50.700
I thought I was on camera.

02:49:50.700 --> 02:49:53.700
I am safe. Okay.

02:49:53.700 --> 02:49:56.700
Um, this game is...

02:49:56.700 --> 02:50:05.700
This company's answer to DDR. Yes, this game will take the world by storm and you will never know what DDR is. You'll just go, oh my god, this game rocks.

02:50:05.700 --> 02:50:08.700
At least that's what they would like to think.

02:50:08.700 --> 02:50:11.700
This game is called Tap-A-Jam.

02:50:11.700 --> 02:50:13.980
Tap-A-Jam.

02:50:13.980 --> 02:50:17.180
And Tap-A-Jam is, well, it's interesting.

02:50:21.140 --> 02:50:22.860
Tap-A-Jam loading.

02:50:22.860 --> 02:50:27.260
And what wonderful songs can you expect in Tap-A-Jam?

02:50:27.260 --> 02:50:28.220
Well, let's see.

02:50:28.220 --> 02:50:29.540
It's all public domain music.

02:50:29.540 --> 02:50:36.420
So we have wonderful songs like Cannon and E.

02:50:36.420 --> 02:50:39.780
Fight of the Bumblebee

02:50:39.780 --> 02:50:42.500
Wow, these are top quality songs, you guys.

02:50:42.500 --> 02:50:45.940
Moonlight Sonata

02:50:45.940 --> 02:50:47.980
Blue Denimy

02:50:47.980 --> 02:50:50.220
Danube

02:50:50.220 --> 02:50:52.860
Simon Says Disco Fingers

02:50:52.860 --> 02:50:55.740
Who knows what that is?

02:50:55.740 --> 02:50:57.860
And more shit

02:50:57.860 --> 02:50:58.900
Oh, and Chopsticks

02:50:58.900 --> 02:51:01.020
Yes, Chopsticks

02:51:01.020 --> 02:51:07.180
And you can see Loki and I are so mature when we play at our high score table.

02:51:07.180 --> 02:51:11.580
Asses in first place and cunts in second place.

02:51:11.580 --> 02:51:13.660
Because we're so mature.

02:51:13.660 --> 02:51:16.180
Okay, so now we're going to show the game here.

02:51:16.180 --> 02:51:18.380
We'll get Jamie's reaction.

02:51:18.380 --> 02:51:19.980
And I'll describe it for our listeners.

02:51:19.980 --> 02:51:26.980
Basically, I changed the controls, sorry guys.

02:51:26.980 --> 02:51:33.980
Ah! Basically you have this up, down, left, right arrow, but it's on the left side of the screen.

02:51:33.980 --> 02:51:37.980
So we've had, you know, we've had DDRs at the top, Beat Manias at the bottom.

02:51:37.980 --> 02:51:40.980
Well, now we have a game where it's on the left side of the screen.

02:51:40.980 --> 02:51:43.980
And so you have the up, left, right, and down arrows.

02:51:44.980 --> 02:51:46.980
It's left, Loki. That one's left.

02:51:46.980 --> 02:51:47.980
Ah, okay.

02:51:47.980 --> 02:51:48.980
And then right and down.

02:51:48.980 --> 02:51:58.980
And as the notes scroll over to the left, you have to hit them when they come in this column, is the way this works.

02:51:58.980 --> 02:52:01.980
Okay, what happened to my mouse? There it goes.

02:52:01.980 --> 02:52:02.980
Okie dokie.

02:52:02.980 --> 02:52:05.980
And what website can they download this from, Loki?

02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:06.980
It's at like...

02:52:06.980 --> 02:52:07.980
That you really want to?

02:52:07.980 --> 02:52:12.980
It's like a game house, is what it's at. Just do a search for tapa jam.

02:52:12.980 --> 02:52:17.980
It's like, oh my god, beatbox bonus feature. I didn't see this before.

02:52:17.980 --> 02:52:20.980
Oh, a beatbox bonus feature, huh?

02:52:20.980 --> 02:52:24.980
Oh, it's, it's... just go, go to the game.

02:52:24.980 --> 02:52:31.980
It's like a music generator, it's gay.

02:52:31.980 --> 02:52:32.980
Alright.

02:52:32.980 --> 02:52:37.980
So he's gonna play this, so...

02:52:37.980 --> 02:52:44.980
And it even has a little wavelength in the bottom of the screen, so it's like instead of pretty videos, you get waves like Winamp.

02:52:44.980 --> 02:52:51.980
listen to loki make that sweet music

02:53:00.380 --> 02:53:03.420
aren't you happy? doesn't this game make you just

02:53:03.420 --> 02:53:07.220
go mini! go in that base, yeah!

02:53:07.220 --> 02:53:09.020
do do do do do do do do

02:53:09.020 --> 02:53:12.540
i feel like breaking down, come on

02:53:12.540 --> 02:53:19.540
Give me your thoughts.

02:53:23.360 --> 02:53:26.940
Actually, combo, oh my god!

02:53:26.940 --> 02:53:30.900
Okay, okay. Perfect.

02:53:30.900 --> 02:53:38.080
I think this is an interesting way to get around having to license any song.

02:53:38.080 --> 02:53:42.020
They just put in a bunch of classical songs.

02:53:42.020 --> 02:53:45.020
That's a pretty smart idea. Hey, we like our classical songs, don't we?

02:53:45.020 --> 02:53:51.020
But, um, I think we like our classical songs better when the renditions don't suck ass.

02:53:51.020 --> 02:53:57.020
When they're played by an orchestra and not some $2 Casio keyboard from Walmart.

02:54:02.020 --> 02:54:03.020
Ah!

02:54:03.020 --> 02:54:08.020
So if you've ever wanted to play BeatMania in the comfort of your own home, go buy a BeatMania machine.

02:54:08.020 --> 02:54:10.020
Do not settle for this shit.

02:54:10.020 --> 02:54:14.020
This is, I think, sort of as a guitar freak show.

02:54:14.020 --> 02:54:16.020
Oh, Loki failed Chopsticks!

02:54:16.020 --> 02:54:19.020
It's because I'm running the camera software.

02:54:19.020 --> 02:54:22.020
It's like, the notes are all, like, one size fails and jump.

02:54:22.020 --> 02:54:26.020
If you thought night style had bad lag, try playing tap and jam with the camera.

02:54:26.020 --> 02:54:28.020
Ugh.

02:54:28.020 --> 02:54:30.020
But anyways, yeah, this game sucks.

02:54:30.020 --> 02:54:32.020
But isn't this interesting?

02:54:32.020 --> 02:54:34.020
Here, this ties into what we were talking about last week.

02:54:34.020 --> 02:54:36.020
We were talking about, you know,

02:54:36.020 --> 02:54:41.020
this into the groove thing is going to get its pants suit off of it because it's copying Konami.

02:54:41.020 --> 02:54:46.020
Well, shit! This is a blatant rip-off of BeatMania if I've ever seen one.

02:54:46.020 --> 02:54:53.020
I mean, they've differed it enough, but it's still, it's shit! It's not even a good rip-off.

02:54:53.020 --> 02:54:57.020
This sounds like shit. Stop broadcasting this shit on the radio.

02:54:57.020 --> 02:55:02.020
We have little enough listeners as it is.

02:55:02.020 --> 02:55:04.580
And, oh, I only get seven more sessions.

02:55:05.300 --> 02:55:06.520
They only limit me to ten.

02:55:06.520 --> 02:55:08.460
I think I'm going to go be violently ill.

02:55:08.460 --> 02:55:09.840
Oh, it's at gamehouse.com.

02:55:09.840 --> 02:55:10.880
That's where you can find it at.

02:55:11.880 --> 02:55:13.260
And what other games do they have?

02:55:13.540 --> 02:55:14.140
They have Collapse.

02:55:14.140 --> 02:55:15.640
Somebody posted a link in our chat room.

02:55:15.640 --> 02:55:17.060
A tiger posted that for you guys.

02:55:18.200 --> 02:55:19.000
Yeah, lame.

02:55:25.600 --> 02:55:25.840
Well.

02:55:25.840 --> 02:55:28.180
This is what happens when people start making.

02:55:28.180 --> 02:55:37.180
This is what, if they have problems licensing music, and if we're into the groove, this is what it's going to be like.

02:55:37.180 --> 02:55:44.180
Yeah, we're going to have MIDI sounding classical pieces, and we'll get to dance to Chopsticks and the Beganoob.

02:55:44.180 --> 02:55:46.180
I'd like to play the one song real quick that I...

02:55:46.180 --> 02:55:49.180
This is Utopia, this is one of the songs that's going to be into the groove.

02:55:49.180 --> 02:55:50.180
Sure, go for it.

02:55:50.180 --> 02:55:52.180
And I didn't really like it that much, but you know...

02:55:52.180 --> 02:55:55.180
Alright, we'll let our listeners judge for themselves.

02:55:55.180 --> 02:55:59.180
This is by Kaa, which is Gil's new name if I'm not mistaken.

02:55:59.180 --> 02:56:03.180
Smiley is the name that I think he's under for this one, you know, he's doing the Naoki thing.

02:56:03.180 --> 02:56:04.180
How cute.

02:56:04.180 --> 02:56:06.180
And, um, well here it is.

02:56:06.180 --> 02:56:09.180
Alright, judge for yourself, here's Utopia from Into the Groove.

02:56:09.180 --> 02:56:11.180
I always think of the Madonna song.

02:56:11.180 --> 02:56:13.180
Okay, come on.

02:56:13.180 --> 02:56:15.180
I can't get away from being Madonna.

02:56:45.180 --> 02:56:46.180
Let's go!

02:56:46.180 --> 02:56:47.180
Let's go!

02:56:47.180 --> 02:56:48.180
Let's go!

02:56:48.180 --> 02:56:49.180
Let's go!

02:56:49.180 --> 02:56:56.180
Let's go, let's go!

02:57:49.180 --> 02:58:17.180
Let's go, let's go Let's go, let's go

02:58:17.180 --> 02:58:21.200
That was Utopia by Kaa, Smiley, Keel, whatever the name is.

02:58:21.200 --> 02:58:23.620
It's a song that's going to be an Into the Groove.

02:58:24.800 --> 02:58:25.760
You guys' thoughts?

02:58:25.760 --> 02:58:29.300
Loki, I know you already said you didn't like it, so I thought we'd see Jamie's thoughts.

02:58:29.960 --> 02:58:33.420
Jamie's curled up in a little ball going to sleep, so you don't think you'd want

02:58:33.420 --> 02:58:34.540
to dance to that one, Jamie?

02:58:36.560 --> 02:58:37.860
No, not much.

02:58:38.200 --> 02:58:43.360
I think, I think, Loki, I think you guys are being a little hard on it.

02:58:43.360 --> 02:58:44.600
I think it's a good song.

02:58:44.600 --> 02:58:52.120
The problem is, it's a good song, but it's badly produced.

02:58:52.120 --> 02:58:57.420
And I'm not blaming the author for this, because I think he's very talented and he's writing

02:58:57.420 --> 02:58:58.420
good music.

02:58:58.420 --> 02:59:01.740
I think he's just probably very limited in what he's able to write, because he probably

02:59:01.740 --> 02:59:07.380
only has so much equipment, but I think with an actual recording studio, if this guy worked

02:59:07.380 --> 02:59:09.780
for Konami, I think the song would be sweet.

02:59:09.780 --> 02:59:13.420
I think it would have the better sampling.

02:59:13.420 --> 02:59:17.300
I think you were exactly right when you said it sounds like a MIDI.

02:59:17.300 --> 02:59:20.540
I think the sampling he's using is not good.

02:59:20.540 --> 02:59:21.700
It's kind of a poor choice.

02:59:21.700 --> 02:59:25.200
The piano sounds a little too MIDI-ish to me.

02:59:25.200 --> 02:59:28.100
I think if he had the right equipment, it would be a kick-ass song.

02:59:28.100 --> 02:59:30.780
I think it would be better produced, basically, is what it is.

02:59:30.780 --> 02:59:33.900
I think it's a good song, badly produced.

02:59:33.900 --> 02:59:36.100
I just don't think that it's a dancing game.

02:59:36.100 --> 02:59:39.480
It just doesn't seem like something I would enjoy playing.

02:59:39.480 --> 02:59:40.480
It's a good song.

02:59:40.480 --> 02:59:43.300
I just don't think I'd enjoy playing it.

02:59:43.300 --> 02:59:45.860
I almost see it more as like a 2DX song, in a way.

02:59:45.860 --> 02:59:47.260
I think if it were more...

02:59:47.260 --> 02:59:50.820
It's funny you should mention that, because it's like a 12-footer in this damn game, so

02:59:50.820 --> 02:59:52.340
the steps are like 2DX.

02:59:52.340 --> 02:59:53.340
You know what?

02:59:53.340 --> 02:59:57.780
And see, that's just going to ruin the song even more, to throw it away on these 12-footers

02:59:57.780 --> 02:59:58.780
and stuff.

02:59:58.780 --> 03:00:01.260
I mean, that's just...

03:00:01.260 --> 03:00:04.100
It's stupid.

03:00:04.100 --> 03:00:05.220
There's no need for it.

03:00:05.220 --> 03:00:06.220
Come on.

03:00:06.220 --> 03:00:07.220
You're going to have...

03:00:07.220 --> 03:00:12.220
Why don't you have a couple 11-footers to kill people, you know, but stick to Fun Steps.

03:00:12.220 --> 03:00:13.620
That song could have some fun steps.

03:00:13.620 --> 03:00:15.040
I think that song could have some really fun steps.

03:00:15.040 --> 03:00:20.140
What they're saying is like they have like a maniac level or whatever and already 10

03:00:20.140 --> 03:00:22.860
of the songs have like 11 and 12 player steps.

03:00:23.040 --> 03:00:25.140
I think the problem is people are trying to think,

03:00:25.140 --> 03:00:29.340
people think that the way they can squeeze more life out of DDR is to make it harder.

03:00:29.980 --> 03:00:32.980
And it's just kind of like, you know what, the human body is going to reach a point.

03:00:32.980 --> 03:00:35.920
And there's a point where it's just not going to be fun for the rest of us anymore.

03:00:35.920 --> 03:00:41.640
You're making the game to satisfy the 1% of people who could pass max period on the first try.

03:00:41.640 --> 03:00:48.480
I'm sorry, but in my eyes, Max Period is no fun at all.

03:00:48.480 --> 03:00:51.400
It's a bad DDR song because it's no fun at all.

03:00:51.400 --> 03:00:56.420
Speeding a song up to 600 beats per minute at the end, that's stupid.

03:00:56.420 --> 03:00:58.720
It's inhuman and doable.

03:00:58.720 --> 03:01:02.440
It's too bad.

03:01:02.440 --> 03:01:03.440
And the song sucks.

03:01:03.440 --> 03:01:04.440
That's a big factor.

03:01:04.440 --> 03:01:05.460
It's a big factor, you know.

03:01:06.180 --> 03:01:12.460
If they're going to do hard ones this long, at least these would be good.

03:01:12.460 --> 03:01:16.440
Okay. Well, any other, any other thoughts on this?

03:01:16.760 --> 03:01:23.100
Any other thoughts on Into the Groove, Tap a Jam,

03:01:23.100 --> 03:01:25.600
any other DDR knockoffs we need to address while we're here?

03:01:26.500 --> 03:01:29.660
I'm just thinking that we can do it way better.

03:01:29.840 --> 03:01:32.040
And like I said, I'm going to take my attempt at it.

03:01:32.040 --> 03:01:34.400
So we'll work on it.

03:01:34.400 --> 03:01:37.880
As I said last week, I'm going to try pushing that and seeing

03:01:37.880 --> 03:01:40.960
if an arcade will take my idea.

03:01:40.960 --> 03:01:44.920
I'm just saying, you could do it a lot better than what

03:01:44.920 --> 03:01:46.760
you're doing right now.

03:01:46.760 --> 03:01:49.480
Whatever, but that's fine.

03:01:49.480 --> 03:01:52.700
I mean, I understand that they have their limitations with

03:01:52.700 --> 03:01:55.840
going the legal route, but a lot of people don't care about

03:01:55.840 --> 03:01:56.460
the legal route.

03:01:56.460 --> 03:01:57.960
That's why the DVR machines are here.

03:01:57.960 --> 03:02:03.560
So, that's the way you've got to look at it.

03:02:04.160 --> 03:02:07.880
Joe Womma wanted to make a point, kind of defending max period a little bit, I guess,

03:02:07.880 --> 03:02:09.600
or whatever, playing devil's advocate.

03:02:09.920 --> 03:02:13.580
How many people play max 300 on two speed, he says, because that's just

03:02:13.580 --> 03:02:15.400
as bad as 600 beats per minute.

03:02:16.020 --> 03:02:18.480
Honestly, I've seen one or two.

03:02:18.560 --> 03:02:20.860
I've not seen that many people that brave it on two speed.

03:02:20.860 --> 03:02:27.260
I mean, some people do it for the challenge, but I don't really see it

03:02:27.260 --> 03:02:28.980
as something practical.

03:02:28.980 --> 03:02:31.060
Most people that do it on two-speed honestly

03:02:31.060 --> 03:02:31.860
haven't memorized it.

03:02:31.860 --> 03:02:32.780
They've played it so goddamn hard.

03:02:32.780 --> 03:02:35.900
Here's the thing is, people don't like BPM-doubled songs,

03:02:35.900 --> 03:02:37.740
songs that the steps are going quite well.

03:02:37.740 --> 03:02:39.820
Yeah, because honestly, Max 300 is only supposed to be 150

03:02:39.820 --> 03:02:40.660
beats per minute.

03:02:40.660 --> 03:02:42.060
Yeah, I mean, we understand that.

03:02:42.060 --> 03:02:42.980
And same with Dropout.

03:02:42.980 --> 03:02:44.060
Dropout's the same way.

03:02:44.060 --> 03:02:46.540
And I understand they go with the bass line on it.

03:02:46.540 --> 03:02:51.020
And they do the bass line goes in eighth notes or whatever

03:02:51.020 --> 03:02:52.540
for max period, not one point.

03:02:52.540 --> 03:02:53.980
And that's why it goes 600.

03:02:53.980 --> 03:02:58.240
But the only reason, the steps for max.period aren't that

03:02:58.240 --> 03:02:59.760
hard, it's just so hard to read.

03:02:59.760 --> 03:03:01.400
It's just stupid.

03:03:01.400 --> 03:03:03.560
And the steps in the beginning are stupid too, because it's

03:03:03.560 --> 03:03:04.640
just jumping.

03:03:04.640 --> 03:03:06.560
It's tons of jumping.

03:03:06.560 --> 03:03:08.320
No one likes that, it's just retarded.

03:03:08.320 --> 03:03:12.680
That's true, a lot of step files in Turnamix 4 got reamed

03:03:12.680 --> 03:03:13.960
for that, right?

03:03:13.960 --> 03:03:16.000
Too many weird jokes and stuff.

03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:18.120
If that were a step file in Turnamix 4, they would be

03:03:18.120 --> 03:03:22.320
bitching, it wouldn't have even made it into the final.

03:03:22.320 --> 03:03:25.840
They would just be laughed off as first off being a horrible

03:03:25.840 --> 03:03:29.680
Max remix, and then two, they would have been like, oh, well

03:03:29.680 --> 03:03:32.480
this is the step file for this is stupid, why did you double

03:03:32.480 --> 03:03:33.760
the BPM at the very end?

03:03:33.760 --> 03:03:35.320
That's retarded.

03:03:35.320 --> 03:03:36.960
They would have laughed at that thing.

03:03:36.960 --> 03:03:41.560
I don't even know why they did that.

03:03:41.560 --> 03:03:44.160
I don't really think they know what they're doing as far as

03:03:44.160 --> 03:03:46.040
step files go.

03:03:46.040 --> 03:03:47.280
I don't think they know what they're doing.

03:03:47.280 --> 03:03:50.880
I don't think they know what their customers want.

03:03:50.880 --> 03:03:55.140
And so, they're looking at symphyls, unfortunately looking at really shitty ones,

03:03:55.600 --> 03:03:57.560
and they're like, well, people like this.

03:03:57.740 --> 03:03:59.420
So, this is what they're doing.

03:03:59.680 --> 03:04:00.980
It just doesn't make any sense.

03:04:03.500 --> 03:04:08.000
Okay. I guess at this point now, we'll open it up for final thoughts

03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:09.640
of the evening, because that's about it.

03:04:09.640 --> 03:04:14.220
Actually, I did want to say, though, Jamie, have a safe trip, fly safe, have fun in Alabama,

03:04:14.220 --> 03:04:17.740
have twice as much fun for me, three times as much, so Loki's covered, too,

03:04:18.180 --> 03:04:19.520
because California's going to suck.

03:04:19.520 --> 03:04:23.040
I know, it'll suck until I get back.

03:04:24.220 --> 03:04:27.560
No, I'll have a good time, you know, I'm going to see my family.

03:04:28.020 --> 03:04:31.680
Hope they don't drive me completely insane by the time I get back.

03:04:32.480 --> 03:04:36.440
But, and I'm going to have, I'm going to have my child with me.

03:04:37.880 --> 03:04:44.020
So, flying sort of parallel flights, so we're going to have lots of hanging out time.

03:04:44.020 --> 03:04:48.420
So it's a girls trip out to Alabama, that should be fun.

03:04:49.020 --> 03:04:50.480
All right, final thoughts of the evening.

03:04:50.760 --> 03:04:51.660
No, I was just thinking.

03:04:51.660 --> 03:04:54.400
Oh, I was just thinking kind of a question opposed to a chat room.

03:04:54.400 --> 03:04:59.480
Sure. If you were to like say go to your normal arcade, you've got like, you know,

03:04:59.480 --> 03:05:03.900
your DVR extreme has been there forever and say it was upgraded with something that was homemade

03:05:04.480 --> 03:05:07.860
but not necessarily like, you know, into the group or its own things.

03:05:07.960 --> 03:05:12.100
Like say someone puts StepMania on there and put like a bunch of like, you know,

03:05:12.100 --> 03:05:14.780
of the old tracks and some of the new tracks, would you be

03:05:14.780 --> 03:05:18.100
that against it if it was a pretty decent

03:05:18.100 --> 03:05:19.580
collection of songs?

03:05:19.580 --> 03:05:22.300
Are you going to be all pissed off that it's just its own

03:05:22.300 --> 03:05:25.060
independent software and not an official Konami thing?

03:05:25.060 --> 03:05:28.980
Or are you just going to be like, hey, this is cool?

03:05:28.980 --> 03:05:30.980
Because that's what I'm getting at.

03:05:30.980 --> 03:05:33.260
I'm just trying to see if people would be so pissed off

03:05:33.260 --> 03:05:38.120
at having a well put together set of songs, but not

03:05:38.120 --> 03:05:40.980
official, because this is into the groove stuff.

03:05:40.980 --> 03:05:45.560
If it was a well put together set of songs, it might be all right, but I don't know.

03:05:46.220 --> 03:05:49.340
Just a little question to throw on there and, you know, discuss.

03:05:50.380 --> 03:05:53.420
All right, well, let's go on and get final thoughts and we'll see

03:05:53.420 --> 03:05:55.460
if there's any answers to that when we get back.

03:05:55.700 --> 03:05:59.560
Somebody wanted to share their final thought with us, somebody who's going

03:05:59.560 --> 03:06:05.260
by the nickname of Skywhore, thank you, thanks, that's great, says their final thought is

03:06:05.260 --> 03:06:08.780
that 2DX has met its match with TapaJam.

03:06:08.780 --> 03:06:11.780
Have another bud, buddy!

03:06:13.780 --> 03:06:16.780
A. You're my whore, for Christ's sake.

03:06:16.780 --> 03:06:26.780
B. No, 2DX has met its match with the, um, I would love to see a mix of songs, like, to do, like, just kind of like an independent thing.

03:06:26.780 --> 03:06:30.780
Have the artist from 2DX and have, like, some of the homebrew artists.

03:06:30.780 --> 03:06:37.300
He has some of the home brew artists fight against each other like, you know,

03:06:37.300 --> 03:06:38.900
like kind of a DJ battle type thing.

03:06:38.900 --> 03:06:42.320
Because there's a lot of home brew artists out there that make really kickass songs

03:06:42.400 --> 03:06:45.400
and animations that go with them, so.

03:06:45.840 --> 03:06:47.480
All right.

03:06:47.800 --> 03:06:49.860
Well, I'm looking to see in the chat room if there's any response

03:06:49.860 --> 03:06:51.380
to your hypothetical question to them.

03:06:51.380 --> 03:06:52.100
And there is not.

03:06:52.500 --> 03:06:53.240
Nobody cares.

03:06:53.240 --> 03:06:55.000
So I guess it's time to end the show.

03:06:55.460 --> 03:06:56.440
Loki, your final thought?

03:06:56.440 --> 03:07:03.440
My final thought is I better get working on my show this week, so I don't have to do it the same day as I usually do.

03:07:03.440 --> 03:07:04.440
Tune in what day?

03:07:04.440 --> 03:07:05.440
Wednesday.

03:07:05.440 --> 03:07:06.440
What time?

03:07:06.440 --> 03:07:08.440
It'll be at seven.

03:07:08.440 --> 03:07:10.440
Sounds good. Jamie, your final thought?

03:07:12.440 --> 03:07:17.440
I have to get up at four in the fucking morning.

03:07:17.440 --> 03:07:19.440
Oh, I'm sorry, final thought.

03:07:19.440 --> 03:07:24.160
thought don't forget my shows gonna be on Monday and Tuesday I'm gonna be on a

03:07:24.160 --> 03:07:31.720
plane so just hope that I don't die or something and that's it

03:07:33.920 --> 03:07:44.360
my final thought is I have nothing more to say that's it Jamie you're gonna have

03:07:44.360 --> 03:07:46.860
the word tonight because I know you enjoy always getting the word and

03:07:46.860 --> 03:07:50.860
You're going to be gone for a couple of weeks, so here you go.

03:07:50.860 --> 03:07:53.580
We go.

03:07:53.580 --> 03:07:56.380
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

03:07:56.380 --> 03:08:00.780
Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sabra, Sky, and Loki.

03:08:00.780 --> 03:08:03.060
We expect you a nice play again.

03:08:03.060 --> 03:08:06.420
And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:08:06.420 --> 03:08:10.100
Well, I object to all this sex on the television.

03:08:10.100 --> 03:08:12.820
I mean, I keep falling off.

03:08:12.820 --> 03:08:15.360
Thanks for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:08:45.360 --> 03:08:57.360
Orange Lounge Radio, the afterbirth, the part after the credits have crawled across the screen and everything you think has come to an end, but it's still going.

03:08:57.360 --> 03:09:00.360
Loki, you did finally get some feedback to your hypothetical situation you posed.

03:09:00.360 --> 03:09:02.360
Okay.

03:09:02.360 --> 03:09:08.360
I think, Zodiac Knight says, I think the potential for any DDR homebrew lies in the song selection.

03:09:08.360 --> 03:09:12.360
Okay. Sounds good.

03:09:12.360 --> 03:09:15.720
zodiac night also says i would take a look at it at least

03:09:15.720 --> 03:09:17.100
give it a try

03:09:17.100 --> 03:09:21.000
the thing i'm concerned about is i want to do this and i think we might have the

03:09:21.000 --> 03:09:23.100
potential to actually put it in the arcade

03:09:23.100 --> 03:09:24.700
but i'm thinking people

03:09:24.700 --> 03:09:27.000
are going to go and see it and they're going to get

03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:28.880
go like on ddr free and go

03:09:28.880 --> 03:09:32.520
oh my god i saw this in the arcade and people were getting pissed off

03:09:32.520 --> 03:09:35.440
and now i'm just going to be bitchy about that

03:09:35.440 --> 03:09:38.920
it's kinda ironic that the people that like the game so much would actually

03:09:38.920 --> 03:09:41.940
ruin it for themselves

03:09:41.940 --> 03:09:44.380
But interesting thought.

03:09:44.380 --> 03:09:49.460
Pixie Dust says, I suck at DDR, but I'd still try it.

03:09:49.460 --> 03:09:50.380
OK.

03:09:50.380 --> 03:09:51.740
Because, like I said.

03:09:51.740 --> 03:09:54.580
So I think everybody's kind of like, OK, I'll try it.

03:09:54.580 --> 03:09:55.580
I'll try it once.

03:09:55.580 --> 03:09:59.140
I'll try it once, twice if I like it.

03:09:59.140 --> 03:10:00.860
Three times to be sure, exactly.

03:10:00.860 --> 03:10:01.360
OK.

03:10:01.360 --> 03:10:02.820
Well, if they had good music, then I

03:10:02.820 --> 03:10:04.420
suppose it would take off and work.

03:10:04.420 --> 03:10:07.260
So that's what I'll have to work on.

03:10:07.260 --> 03:10:08.260
I'll have to work on it.

03:10:08.260 --> 03:10:09.900
You should use my evil edits.

03:10:09.900 --> 03:10:13.360
No Stylin says, no Stylin says he's going to miss you, Jamie.

03:10:13.760 --> 03:10:16.140
And he's going to miss, pump up the volume as well.

03:10:16.620 --> 03:10:17.780
Well, it'll still be playing.

03:10:17.780 --> 03:10:18.860
You'll get to hear some of the old ones.

03:10:19.400 --> 03:10:25.320
And, you know, maybe, maybe the Tuesday night I get back, if I'm not like dead to the world,

03:10:25.320 --> 03:10:26.900
I'll toss on some Eurobeat for you.

03:10:27.300 --> 03:10:30.380
I have a couple things I was going to be planning.

03:10:31.460 --> 03:10:34.220
Livewire for the 19th of November.

03:10:34.220 --> 03:10:38.380
I'm going to have to do something special for that, some Bomani related thing.

03:10:38.380 --> 03:10:46.600
And then, what was it, also I think, I don't know,

03:10:46.600 --> 03:10:49.040
might try to do something special for New Year's.

03:10:49.160 --> 03:10:50.820
I don't know, depending on what I'm doing.

03:10:52.700 --> 03:10:54.060
We should do something on New Year's.

03:10:54.060 --> 03:10:55.360
What day is New Year's?

03:10:55.980 --> 03:10:58.300
I do something every New Year's though.

03:10:58.740 --> 03:11:01.440
Yeah, I'm thinking if anything runs on New Year's,

03:11:01.440 --> 03:11:03.200
it's going to be taped because I don't want to be here.

03:11:03.360 --> 03:11:06.740
We always do an anime marathon and get really drunk.

03:11:06.740 --> 03:11:10.940
Yeah, I'm thinking I want to go out and get wasted because I didn't get to do it for Halloween,

03:11:10.940 --> 03:11:13.940
so I'm going to be doing it for New Year's.

03:11:13.940 --> 03:11:16.260
You can come get wasted with me, Loki.

03:11:16.260 --> 03:11:17.460
Come on.

03:11:17.460 --> 03:11:20.340
Drunk Rob is awesome, isn't it?

03:11:20.340 --> 03:11:26.240
Drunk Rob is funny, Mr. Piñata.

03:11:26.240 --> 03:11:29.140
I got called by somebody drunk last night three times.

03:11:29.140 --> 03:11:34.280
I won't embarrass them on the air by saying who it is, but it was really funny.

03:11:34.280 --> 03:11:35.280
It was great.

03:11:35.280 --> 03:11:36.280
And he called today to apologize.

03:11:36.280 --> 03:11:42.040
I'm like you don't have to apologize you're funny this is cool so it's funny

03:11:42.040 --> 03:11:50.960
drunk people are hilarious you know what what I I you've seen me get drunk but I

03:11:50.960 --> 03:11:53.800
don't think I'm funny when I'm drunk because it doesn't last

03:11:53.800 --> 03:12:00.280
ah you've been funny when you're drunk oh just I've seen you I've seen you be

03:12:00.280 --> 03:12:04.000
funny when you're drunk I go around giving other people drinks because I

03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:06.120
I want them to be as junk as me.

03:12:06.120 --> 03:12:13.120
People are calling on the phone, not realizing we're trying to do a show in this house.

03:12:18.900 --> 03:12:21.980
Who's the goober that called?

03:12:21.980 --> 03:12:26.820
Yeah, I can have him call you.

03:12:26.820 --> 03:12:29.460
Who was the goober that called?

03:12:29.460 --> 03:12:31.540
That was Matt, so you can yell at him.

03:12:31.540 --> 03:12:37.700
are you still doing that? Yeah, we are. It's only been 67 weeks now, I think. Yeah, we're

03:12:37.700 --> 03:12:43.580
still doing it. Oh my God, you guys, we've been doing this for 67 weeks. We have technically

03:12:43.580 --> 03:12:49.980
been doing it for 69 weeks because we've had our two. True, we had two tape shows. Technically,

03:12:49.980 --> 03:12:57.060
technically, technically, this is the 69th show. So you are here after all. But the way

03:12:57.060 --> 03:13:00.660
We've been counting 69 is coming up in a couple of those are half episodes. Yeah

03:13:01.180 --> 03:13:06.580
This is it's so weird you guys I can I don't I can remember back to the first episode

03:13:08.860 --> 03:13:11.340
Well, I already said when we hit a hundred I'm quitting

03:13:13.580 --> 03:13:18.180
We're gonna keep going all right, we'll keep going we're gonna be geriatric and

03:13:19.060 --> 03:13:23.300
PC just wants to take me to LA for New Year's. I'm down with that. I

03:13:23.300 --> 03:13:27.120
I want to go, I want to go, I want to go far away for New Year's.

03:13:27.120 --> 03:13:27.860
I want to travel.

03:13:27.860 --> 03:13:29.320
I want to have money and travel.

03:13:29.320 --> 03:13:30.100
That's what I'm going to do.

03:13:30.100 --> 03:13:35.520
Yeah, but I want a cookie, but I can't have that.

03:13:35.520 --> 03:13:39.900
All right, your post-show tonight is going to be a recycled preshow,

03:13:39.900 --> 03:13:42.140
one of Jamie's old preshows, and it's one I like.

03:13:42.880 --> 03:13:45.020
So I've decided that that's going to be tonight's post-show.

03:13:45.020 --> 03:13:46.320
Oh, and which one, pray tell?

03:13:46.420 --> 03:13:49.120
It is the one with all the Svensson and Gielin mixes.

03:13:49.120 --> 03:13:50.160
Oh, that one was fun.

03:13:50.240 --> 03:13:51.020
Yes, it was.

03:13:51.020 --> 03:13:57.020
So, um, oh wait, now I'm curious, now before I get into the post-show, somebody says, Joe Mama says,

03:13:57.020 --> 03:14:04.020
The first episodes were fun. Did we jump the shark or something? What's wrong with the recent episodes?

03:14:04.020 --> 03:14:10.020
I think there's, like, like a fine wine we've improved with age.

03:14:10.020 --> 03:14:12.020
I don't know, I've been noticing that.

03:14:12.020 --> 03:14:14.020
Or, like, a mold gotten bigger.

03:14:14.020 --> 03:14:16.020
I've been less bitter lately.

03:14:16.020 --> 03:14:21.500
And it's like I get to Sunday and I'm already like relaxed like I'll be angry all throughout the week

03:14:21.500 --> 03:14:23.740
And I just kind of calm down on the weekend

03:14:24.340 --> 03:14:27.460
It's not because I'm getting laid more anything. It's just because I

03:14:27.980 --> 03:14:31.980
Don't know. It's just calming. I'm the only one not getting laid. I should be the bitter one

03:14:32.900 --> 03:14:38.060
But even when I wasn't I was I mean even when I was I was still getting I was still bitter

03:14:38.060 --> 03:14:42.000
It's just like I think I don't go out enough and get like people

03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:46.160
pissing me off enough or it's the same people pissing me off so it's like yeah

03:14:46.160 --> 03:14:51.560
been there so has orange lounge radio jumped the shark yet you think or you

03:14:51.560 --> 03:14:56.920
think we still got a ways to go I'm very scared to think of 23 makers with a man

03:14:56.920 --> 03:15:04.200
slut well now oh I see Joe mama is thinking back to those days when only

03:15:04.200 --> 03:15:07.960
like six people frequented our chat room during the shows and now we have and we

03:15:07.960 --> 03:15:12.960
We just didn't give a fuck, and guess what, we still don't give a fuck.

03:15:12.960 --> 03:15:16.960
Yeah, I mean the number of people has never been that important to us.

03:15:16.960 --> 03:15:22.960
I mean, because obviously if we were numbers, we don't get that many people in retrospect to listen to the show.

03:15:22.960 --> 03:15:26.960
But in internet radio terms, quite a few actually.

03:15:26.960 --> 03:15:29.960
Quite a few for an internet radio show, which is...

03:15:29.960 --> 03:15:31.960
We are loved.

03:15:31.960 --> 03:15:33.960
And we have all you guys to thank.

03:15:33.960 --> 03:15:36.740
it's getting bigger every week I see new faces coming in the chat room it's

03:15:36.740 --> 03:15:44.220
awesome it's awesome and we love you guys I'm sorry that you haven't gotten

03:15:44.220 --> 03:15:53.180
laid that's pixie dust I know I'm sorry that you haven't gotten laid you come

03:15:53.180 --> 03:15:59.460
over pixie dust I show you good time I'll show your boobs some loving people

03:15:59.460 --> 03:16:01.560
You don't need to get laid to be happy.

03:16:01.940 --> 03:16:05.240
Some people are perfectly happy being asexual.

03:16:05.420 --> 03:16:11.340
But, but, but getting laid definitely like takes the little like hyper dog out of you,

03:16:11.340 --> 03:16:14.260
you know, it's just like mellow.

03:16:14.260 --> 03:16:18.940
And to be honest, I can think of a few people that could use a little mellowy.

03:16:20.060 --> 03:16:28.080
Sorry. You know what, I'm sorry, but getting laid just does one thing for me.

03:16:28.080 --> 03:16:29.100
It makes me want ice cream.

03:16:30.040 --> 03:16:30.460
That's it.

03:16:30.860 --> 03:16:31.800
Just remember.

03:16:32.480 --> 03:16:35.860
Yes, could I order vanilla cream with an orgasm mix in?

03:16:35.860 --> 03:16:38.840
No, come back here and make your comment on the air.

03:16:38.840 --> 03:16:39.560
That was great.

03:16:39.680 --> 03:16:40.480
That was brilliant.

03:16:41.980 --> 03:16:45.600
Just remember, without sex, Ben and Jerry's wouldn't be doing so well.

03:16:47.760 --> 03:16:49.160
Orange cream, anyone?

03:16:50.140 --> 03:16:53.560
What else am I thinking of here?

03:16:53.560 --> 03:16:54.300
Vanilla chunk.

03:16:54.300 --> 03:17:00.300
I don't know, it had something to do with the show, but I guess it wasn't that bad.

03:17:00.300 --> 03:17:05.300
Oh, I know what it is. I know what it is. It actually has nothing to do with the show. It has to do with getting laid, which is even better than the show.

03:17:05.300 --> 03:17:07.300
It has to do with the show.

03:17:07.300 --> 03:17:13.300
You know what? For some people, some people don't need to get laid. Some people just want to cuddle.

03:17:13.300 --> 03:17:15.300
Aww.

03:17:17.300 --> 03:17:21.300
There was a funny line in, um, what was it, in, um,

03:17:21.300 --> 03:17:24.300
Boondock Saints, where they're talking about cuddling,

03:17:24.300 --> 03:17:27.300
because the one, uh, cop who's the perfect investigator,

03:17:27.300 --> 03:17:30.300
and he's, he's a gay guy, but he acts like a straight guy.

03:17:30.300 --> 03:17:32.300
It's kind of weird, it's like this guy's trying to cuddle with him,

03:17:32.300 --> 03:17:34.300
he's like, what the fuck you want? You want to cuddle?

03:17:34.300 --> 03:17:38.300
He's like, man, you're so gay, and he, like, gets up and walks away.

03:17:38.300 --> 03:17:40.300
That was funny.

03:17:55.300 --> 03:17:57.300
Alright, let's get it, alright.

03:17:57.300 --> 03:17:59.300
The bear's been getting it on!

03:17:59.300 --> 03:18:04.300
Alright, um, that's it. We're gonna go into Poshaw now.

03:18:04.300 --> 03:18:09.300
It's, uh, Benjamin Guillen music, started off with a little bit of Ayumi Hamasaki, huh?

03:18:09.300 --> 03:18:11.300
Would depend on you, I can't wait to mute these microphones.

03:18:11.300 --> 03:18:14.300
Say goodbye to the, say goodbye to the ferrets, Jamie.

03:18:14.300 --> 03:18:19.300
They're coming with me! You can't take them back, you'll never see!

03:18:19.300 --> 03:18:21.300
Oh wait

03:19:19.300 --> 03:19:21.300
Oh

03:19:49.300 --> 03:19:51.300
Oh

03:25:19.300 --> 03:25:28.300
I'm gonna take some time to lose my way

03:25:28.300 --> 03:25:35.300
From the dark to the light to the sun and light

03:25:35.300 --> 03:25:40.300
Put your hands in the air

03:25:40.300 --> 03:25:56.700
Put your hand in my hand.

03:25:56.700 --> 03:26:04.500
Put your hand in my hand.

03:26:04.500 --> 03:26:07.500
my head

03:26:07.500 --> 03:26:11.000
Let me show you the way

03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:14.500
and you will understand

03:26:14.500 --> 03:26:17.500
Let me show you the way

03:26:17.500 --> 03:26:21.500
with your hands in my hand

03:26:21.500 --> 03:26:24.500
Let me show you the way

03:26:24.500 --> 03:26:29.000
and you will understand

03:26:29.000 --> 03:26:33.000
Oh, shove you away

03:26:43.000 --> 03:26:47.000
Oh, shove you away

03:27:47.000 --> 03:28:15.680
Down the trees, down the alley, down the trees, any way

03:28:15.680 --> 03:28:22.680
I'm gonna die to the light of the ocean in the dark

03:28:22.680 --> 03:28:29.680
I'm gonna die to the pain of the future in the rain

03:28:29.680 --> 03:28:36.680
I'm gonna die to the light of the ocean in the dark

03:28:36.680 --> 03:28:42.680
You're running right

03:28:42.680 --> 03:28:47.680
You're running right in my head

03:28:47.680 --> 03:28:50.680
Let me show you

03:28:50.680 --> 03:28:54.680
What you have in my head

03:28:54.680 --> 03:28:57.680
Let me show you

03:28:57.680 --> 03:29:02.680
The way that you will never die

03:29:02.680 --> 03:29:04.680
Show you the way

03:29:04.680 --> 03:29:08.680
Show you the way, show you the way

03:29:08.680 --> 03:29:12.680
I'm taking you

03:29:12.680 --> 03:29:16.680
I'm taking you

03:29:16.680 --> 03:29:20.680
I'm taking you

03:29:20.680 --> 03:29:24.680
Put your hand in my hand

03:29:24.680 --> 03:29:28.680
Show you the way

03:29:28.680 --> 03:29:32.680
And you will understand

03:29:32.680 --> 03:29:37.680
You don't like it when you see a better day than the things that I wear

03:31:37.680 --> 03:31:39.680
You
