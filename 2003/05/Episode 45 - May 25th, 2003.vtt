00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio Season 3, now with 200% more hot monkey sex.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain 200% more hot monkey sex.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
It will contain 300% more hot monkey sex.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
Hey guys, cut the track!

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Okay, I guess it's back to the real intro.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
Yeah, me and him have fun, too!

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Toto?

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio for Monty Talk and Then Some.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Yes, I will spank your child.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Well, here's my big opening.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
A sphincter says what?

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
I'm super. Thanks for asking.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
What am I doing here?

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
No.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Dodge this.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
Mm-hmm. This is a tasty burger.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Look, you stupid bastard. You've got no arms left.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Yes, I have. Look.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Just a flesh wound.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
Searching for a boy in high school isn't useless.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
It's searching for meaning in a polyshore.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
Oh, yeah? Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Dark Sakura.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
but I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Loki.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
I hate you!

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:55.000 --> 02:03.240

02:27.340 --> 02:29.820

02:29.820 --> 02:31.740
No, I was going to buy some in San Francisco.

02:31.740 --> 02:35.420
We found SARS masks in the Japan Center Mall.

02:35.420 --> 02:36.580
That's cool.

11:32.160 --> 11:34.460
uh brad's still outside but hi everyone

11:34.460 --> 11:36.720
how was the pool

11:36.720 --> 11:38.720
So, there's too many people there.

11:38.720 --> 11:39.720
Oh.

11:39.720 --> 11:44.400
I'm afraid of pools and apartment complexes.

11:44.400 --> 11:45.960
Why are you afraid of pools?

11:45.960 --> 11:46.960
Yeah.

11:46.960 --> 11:49.520
Jamie, why are you afraid of pools?

11:49.520 --> 11:52.220
Because little children pee and go poo.

11:52.220 --> 11:58.560
I was in a public pool once and I saw a big turd floating in the pool.

11:58.560 --> 12:03.720
That reminds me of Caddyshack where the baby roosters fall from the pool.

12:03.720 --> 12:04.720
I actually saw it happen.

12:04.720 --> 12:09.720
Let's talk about things that have happened while we were last on the air, which was two weeks ago.

12:09.720 --> 12:10.720
I got SARS.

12:10.720 --> 12:13.720
Okay, go in the shower.

12:13.720 --> 12:15.720
We're trying to do a show here, hello.

12:15.720 --> 12:17.720
Jamie, how was your two weeks?

12:17.720 --> 12:20.720
Um, it was okay.

12:20.720 --> 12:23.720
We sort of did a show last weekend, sort of.

12:23.720 --> 12:26.720
Yeah, we broadcasted all day long from B3.

12:26.720 --> 12:30.720
What did you guys think of B3? What did you think of B3, the big tournament that happened at Pier 39?

12:30.720 --> 12:33.720
I sort of missed all of Sunday because I decided to go to the mall.

12:33.720 --> 12:40.280
I don't know, do you think B3, because a lot of people online were kind of like, kind of

12:40.280 --> 12:44.240
had this kind of, like, you know how B3 was supposed to be like this huge tournament,

12:44.240 --> 12:46.600
you know, it was going to be like the biggest tournament ever, and a lot of people just

12:46.600 --> 12:48.440
came back from it feeling kind of mediocre.

12:48.440 --> 12:50.160
They were like, uh, PA kind of down the hill thing.

12:50.160 --> 12:53.160
I think it was timing because there was a lot going on around there.

12:53.160 --> 12:54.160
I agree.

12:54.160 --> 12:55.160
I think it was just bad timing.

12:55.160 --> 12:58.160
I think the original plan for B3 is that they were supposed to do it over spring break,

12:58.160 --> 13:03.000
and I think that would have been cool, but the time they did it just kind of turned out

13:03.000 --> 13:08.280
I don't know. Yeah, it's too bad because they ended up doing it the same weekend as e3

13:08.280 --> 13:10.280
Which caused a lot of confusion in the names alone

13:10.280 --> 13:17.520
I think it's weird though because everything at the tournament was put together really well and everything was run really well

13:17.520 --> 13:24.360
I mean sure ran a little late, but all tournaments do but yet despite how everything how great everything ran

13:24.360 --> 13:31.880
It's just kind of everybody was just kind of bleh and freestyle with the exception of two routines was kind of bleh.

13:33.040 --> 13:40.400
I don't know. That's my little rant on b3. I mean it's certainly nobody's fault. It's just kind of like I think everybody just kind of

13:41.000 --> 13:45.440
Must have had what I think everybody was on their collective period or something. I think that's what it is

13:47.640 --> 13:49.640
Jamie you're staring off into space

13:49.640 --> 13:56.300
You have anything you want to say about B3, Logie?

13:56.300 --> 14:02.160
I didn't get a badge and I didn't get a chair until after I asked.

14:02.160 --> 14:14.620
And I didn't get my free shirt done, as promised.

14:14.620 --> 14:19.120
I liked being able to broadcast though because like we were like five feet away from the machine and that was cool

14:19.360 --> 14:25.600
Because we were like broadcasting everybody there were stop stop stop stop stop. Yeah, stop stop stop stop

14:26.020 --> 14:28.200
There were a lot of you guys listening to the stomp

14:28.200 --> 14:31.980
I think a lot of you tuned in and just kind of had it as background noise noise for the day

14:31.980 --> 14:34.500
which is cool, you know, whatever whatever floats your boat and

14:35.020 --> 14:36.340
I

14:36.340 --> 14:40.900
Think it gives me anyway battleship. Yeah, it gives me incentive anyway to

14:40.900 --> 14:46.620
to uh... broadcast for more terms in the future

14:46.620 --> 14:47.540
well

14:47.540 --> 14:49.940
can you guys shut the door

14:49.940 --> 14:52.380
season

14:52.380 --> 14:55.540
and i mean speaking in and get it

14:55.540 --> 14:58.580
i have three people in my shower right now

14:58.580 --> 15:02.080
this is all the season premiere stuff going on we had nudity new characters

15:02.080 --> 15:04.980
and now they're all in my shower at the same time

15:04.980 --> 15:09.980
I saw Garret's ass. He's showing me a scar by his ass. How funny.

15:09.980 --> 15:14.980
I'm not taking a shower. I'm right here.

15:14.980 --> 15:19.980
She says she's right here, staying in the studio, not taking a shower.

15:19.980 --> 15:24.980
But she's in the shower. I don't believe her.

15:24.980 --> 15:29.980
Segue, segue. While we were sort of on the subject of B3, Loki, I believe you owe me something.

15:29.980 --> 15:36.980
Perhaps, I don't know, an apology. As promised. You are on the spot!

15:36.980 --> 15:41.980
Loki's eyes got really big like a deer in headlights. He doesn't even remember.

15:41.980 --> 15:46.980
What the hell are you talking about?

15:46.980 --> 15:53.980
What? What the hell are you talking about? Seriously?

15:53.980 --> 15:55.980
Of what?

15:55.980 --> 15:59.140
you need to remind loki what he said to make that actually keep up with what

15:59.140 --> 16:04.420
does on these episodes

16:04.420 --> 16:06.480
i believe there is this really

16:06.480 --> 16:07.780
uh... bad

16:07.780 --> 16:10.220
wait what was the second day freestyle or

16:10.220 --> 16:12.780
first it was p a m freestyle

16:12.780 --> 16:15.660
yeah i think it was a really bad freestyle and you're like

16:15.660 --> 16:17.740
oh my god if these people that were here

16:17.740 --> 16:22.200
or at uh... shaft and brewing maggots off that they would

16:22.200 --> 16:26.200
screw the other guy up instead and cheer Magus on. I was confused. Anyway, whatever.

16:26.200 --> 16:29.200
Yeah, because that guy really sucked.

16:29.200 --> 16:34.200
I mean, he was like, oh my god, spazzing up on the pad.

16:34.200 --> 16:38.200
And this is relief for me, who went out to go get Oyakodar.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.200
But no, no apologies, sorry.

16:40.200 --> 16:43.200
Ah, he died.

16:43.200 --> 16:46.200
As Magus shows Loki his IQ of one.

16:46.200 --> 16:49.200
Very, very nice.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.200
I hear you turning dials.

16:52.200 --> 16:54.200
This camera is the suck.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.200
No wonder these are bi-link hit-win-free, they're ass.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.200
So why are we having all this dead airspace, Rob?

17:06.200 --> 17:09.200
I have no idea, because I'm too distracted by the people in my shower right now.

17:10.200 --> 17:13.200
Because I keep hearing nudity and oh my god and ass and tattoos and scarves.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.200
Did you just like put them all out in the yard and get the water hose?

17:15.200 --> 17:16.200
water hose.

17:16.200 --> 17:23.280
First, Irene walks in the door when Garrett's changing, she doesn't bother knocking.

17:23.280 --> 17:26.760
This time, she knows that he's in the shower, but he opens up the shark urn, she opens the

17:26.760 --> 17:29.120
shark urn anyway, and he's naked.

17:29.120 --> 17:34.600
No, I just realized that he was all changing and getting naked, he had a towel around him,

17:34.600 --> 17:35.600
okay?

17:35.600 --> 17:39.520
Well, great, we got our nudity out of the way in the first ten minutes of the show,

17:39.520 --> 17:40.520
beautiful.

17:40.520 --> 17:42.200
But we haven't even talked about porn yet.

17:42.200 --> 17:45.500
I know and there's been no porn discussion yet

17:45.500 --> 17:47.280
uh... also

17:47.280 --> 17:48.200
what movie?

17:48.200 --> 17:52.980
Oh, tell us about the movie we watched last night, Angel. I'll let you tell the story.

17:52.980 --> 17:55.660
Oh, was that last night when she was here?

17:55.660 --> 17:57.820
Or Thursday night?

17:57.820 --> 18:00.340
Yeah, I caught it!

18:00.340 --> 18:02.620
Yeah, tell us about the movie we watched Thursday night.

18:02.620 --> 18:04.880
It sucked ass.

18:04.880 --> 18:06.220
It was kinda boring and

18:06.220 --> 18:09.840
I don't even know why the hell you got me to watch it.

18:09.840 --> 18:10.820
Never rent

18:10.820 --> 18:17.820
whatever the hell that movie was

18:18.880 --> 18:21.100
the film that we watched was called

18:21.100 --> 18:25.680
Envy, actually it says Envy on the box, it's actual full title is called Penis Envy

18:25.680 --> 18:29.780
it's a story about these two drifting chicks, they're walking through the desert

18:29.780 --> 18:33.080
they go to this bar and they get really drunk and I mean this is talking about

18:33.080 --> 18:35.080
like white trash America

18:35.080 --> 18:38.680
they get drunk and they're walking through the desert and all of a sudden they go

18:38.680 --> 18:40.600
Wouldn't it be great to have a penis?

18:40.600 --> 18:43.680
And so they walk around, and lo and behold,

18:43.680 --> 18:45.100
when this one chick's taking a piss,

18:45.100 --> 18:49.640
they find the penis fairy, which is this giant drag queen guy.

18:49.640 --> 18:52.580
And then they go and ask the penis fairy for a penis,

18:52.580 --> 18:54.040
and they get a penis.

18:54.040 --> 18:56.160
But with the penis comes great responsibility.

18:56.160 --> 19:00.120
And they have mustaches, and body hair, and tattoos,

19:00.120 --> 19:01.600
and they start acting like guys.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.600
Hey, Loki?

19:03.600 --> 19:04.960
Was it Mr. Spanky?

19:04.960 --> 19:10.780
And then they start like, you know, screwing this one chick and then this other thing,

19:10.780 --> 19:15.020
they screw this other guy and then eventually they get tired of having a penis and so they go

19:15.020 --> 19:18.500
and find the penis fairy in LA where she's at a gay bar.

19:18.980 --> 19:22.020
And then they ask for the penis fairy to remove the penis and then,

19:22.500 --> 19:29.300
but the one chick likes the penis so much and then she ends up getting killed in the end.

19:29.900 --> 19:31.180
That was beautiful, thank you.

19:31.180 --> 19:38.180
Anyway, let's try to focus on some Bahmani news, because there was lots of it while we were gone for two weeks.

19:38.180 --> 19:43.180
So, Max 2 USA was the big kind of announcement that...

19:43.180 --> 19:49.180
Well, there were several games that were announced at E3, the big convention that none of us got to go to, because nobody takes this show seriously.

19:49.180 --> 19:50.180
Hey, I could have gone.

19:50.180 --> 19:53.180
You could have been able to go, but not because of this show.

19:53.180 --> 19:54.180
I couldn't get off work.

19:54.180 --> 19:56.180
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:56.180 --> 20:19.180
But there were lots of fun things discussed at E3. First off was Max2USA and we heard a bunch of songs were announced for inclusion, including Days Go By by Dirty Vegas, the song you heard in the last break, Four Strings Take Me Away into the Night, and also Jocelyn and Rika's Little Bit of Ecstasy. All those songs, by the way, are in rotation right now in our stations, so if you want to check them out.

20:19.180 --> 20:27.180
But what I find really interesting about Max2USA is that the real music videos are going to be in the backgrounds now.

20:27.180 --> 20:30.180
That's going to be pretty cool.

20:30.180 --> 20:39.180
Do you think that there's going to be an option where you can select, oh I want the big seizure, flashy looking graphics, amazing Japanese fun, or you can have the real music video?

20:39.180 --> 20:45.180
I don't know, but it doesn't bother me either way.

20:45.180 --> 20:50.180
I wonder if they're going to have long versions because of the music videos.

20:50.180 --> 20:51.180
Long versions, that would be interesting.

20:51.180 --> 20:56.180
Now, you know they've promised, I guess, different modes that we haven't seen in the U.S. before?

20:56.180 --> 20:59.180
Music video mode.

20:59.180 --> 21:02.180
So, like, music video mode, like, where you could just watch the videos.

21:02.180 --> 21:06.180
Kind of like, okay, you're remembering 2DX6 style, how you could just watch the videos if you wanted to?

21:06.180 --> 21:08.180
Do you think they'll have something like that?

21:08.180 --> 21:09.180
That'd be cool.

21:09.180 --> 21:11.180
Yes, that would be neat.

21:11.180 --> 21:16.500
Because I know that I've had gatherings where people just put in sick style and watch the

21:16.500 --> 21:20.540
videos and drank.

21:20.540 --> 21:22.700
I could go for some drink.

21:22.700 --> 21:26.220
Do they have the mode where you get to meet Kiryamoka?

21:26.220 --> 21:31.020
Because he was at E3 and yeah.

21:31.020 --> 21:36.300
Because I don't really give a shit about Max USA or any DDR or whatnot.

21:36.300 --> 21:40.300
I want to be Kiryamoka.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.900
Why don't you give a shit about Max 2 USA, because I'll tell you right now, it's going

21:42.900 --> 21:46.340
to be better than the Japanese Max 2, because I played the Japanese Max 2 for three days

21:46.340 --> 21:48.820
and I haven't played since.

21:48.820 --> 21:51.300
Because this DDR sucks.

21:51.300 --> 21:52.300
I play Beatmania.

21:52.300 --> 21:54.540
When are they going to bring out a new console, Beatmania?

21:54.540 --> 21:57.700
That's all I care about.

21:57.700 --> 21:59.300
That was the other interesting bit of news.

21:59.300 --> 22:03.340
There was this big rumor going around that Konami was going to, I know we talked about

22:03.340 --> 22:05.380
this on the show and we read it with extreme caution.

22:05.380 --> 22:07.020
I think I called it, didn't I?

22:07.020 --> 22:08.020
Oh yeah.

22:08.020 --> 22:10.540
sure we all approach it with this big bit of skepticism.

22:10.540 --> 22:13.640
If I remember right, the news source wasn't a very trustworthy one.

22:13.640 --> 22:19.340
But they were announcing 2DX USA, and they were going to have a machine brought to E3,

22:19.340 --> 22:24.440
and they were going to bring in like Take and Yes, or no, not them, Lisu and who's the

22:24.440 --> 22:25.440
other guy?

22:25.440 --> 22:26.440
Agop.

22:26.440 --> 22:30.140
They were going to bring in Lisu and Agop and have them playing at E3 to show Americans

22:30.140 --> 22:31.140
how to play 2DX.

22:31.140 --> 22:34.060
What a bunch of crap.

22:34.060 --> 22:36.080
So that didn't end up happening.

22:36.080 --> 22:37.080
But I don't know.

22:37.080 --> 22:43.080
I'm pretty sure we talked about it on the show before, but does the USA really deserve 2DX?

22:43.080 --> 22:44.080
It just happened anyway.

22:44.080 --> 22:47.080
If they brought 2DX to the USA, it wouldn't sell for shit.

22:47.080 --> 22:50.080
Like, how everyone said that...

22:50.080 --> 22:58.080
They complained that frequency was too difficult, so they made amplitude easier, and hence it became an even bigger piece of crap.

22:58.080 --> 23:03.080
I like amplitude.

23:03.080 --> 23:06.080
What would you like to repeat that for our listeners?

23:06.080 --> 23:10.080
I like Super Sproat, that song is cool and that's about it.

23:10.080 --> 23:14.080
Wait, so before we move on to other games, nobody has any other thoughts on Max 2 USA?

23:14.080 --> 23:18.080
Is anybody looking forward to it? Nobody cares?

23:18.080 --> 23:22.080
It'll be out, but you know. It'll be fun for about a week.

23:22.080 --> 23:26.080
You know what though, I am going to have the Xbox One. Oh yeah, that's the other one we can talk about.

23:26.080 --> 23:30.080
I have no choice because we get everything cool that comes out on Xbox.

23:30.080 --> 23:34.080
I mean, I got Steel Battalion, of course I'm going to have DDR.

23:34.080 --> 23:41.080
DDR, although the dance pad looks retarded, it's green, and it's official though.

23:41.080 --> 23:45.120
I don't know, the dance pads are kind of scary to me, they're all freaky looking.

23:45.120 --> 23:46.120
Like they're red.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.120
They're Xbox-y.

23:47.120 --> 23:48.720
Well, Xbox everything is freaky looking.

23:48.720 --> 23:51.480
But they're actually Konami made pads.

23:51.480 --> 23:52.480
Hmm.

23:52.480 --> 23:57.800
Well, you know the producer of the DDR Xbox game was on DDR Freak earlier this week and

23:57.800 --> 24:00.420
he said a few things about the game, which are interesting.

24:00.420 --> 24:05.180
He says that the look of the game that they showed at E3 is not representative of the

24:05.180 --> 24:06.660
final gameplay.

24:06.660 --> 24:10.940
So in that version there was no 3D, no music videos, and haven't even begun to show what

24:10.940 --> 24:12.780
the Xbox is capable of.

24:12.780 --> 24:15.780
So I guess that's kind of interesting because I guess in a way they're saying, hey, Max

24:15.780 --> 24:21.800
2 USA was further along than DDR Xbox was.

24:21.800 --> 24:28.920
Also Freezeros will be in DDR Ultramax except there were none at E3.

24:28.920 --> 24:32.420
You're going to be able to play it online, so you're going to be able to get on Xbox

24:32.420 --> 24:36.900
Live and have live rankings and statistics, and your individual scores will be able to

24:36.900 --> 24:41.020
be ranked with the rest of the people via a live connection, and you can also have edited

24:41.020 --> 24:45.600
step data, and you can upload and download that by users, and new songs will be released

24:45.600 --> 24:47.100
on a monthly basis for download.

24:47.100 --> 24:50.740
However, there's a rumor going around that says you might have to pay for these songs.

24:50.740 --> 24:51.740
Who knows?

24:51.740 --> 24:53.380
Yeah, what is that about?

24:53.380 --> 24:57.420
I mean, if it were, like, for the licensed stuff, I could understand, but if it were

24:57.420 --> 25:02.140
I mean, that doesn't sound fair.

25:02.140 --> 25:04.860
Especially if they're all songs we've played to death already.

25:04.860 --> 25:08.940
I don't think I could rationalize paying like five bucks for a new song or something, you

25:08.940 --> 25:10.340
know?

25:10.340 --> 25:14.180
Would anybody here actually admit to paying for new DDR songs just so they could have

25:14.180 --> 25:15.180
everything?

25:15.180 --> 25:16.180
No.

25:16.180 --> 25:17.180
Okay.

25:17.180 --> 25:18.180
That's a no.

25:18.180 --> 25:20.660
How about the chat room?

25:20.660 --> 25:21.660
I don't know.

25:21.660 --> 25:23.660
I'm not even watching the chat room right now.

25:23.660 --> 25:24.660
Chat room?

25:24.660 --> 25:26.620
Who cares about them?

25:26.620 --> 25:29.860
We do. I love chat room.

25:29.860 --> 25:31.960
You hang out in our chat room?

25:31.960 --> 25:34.660
It sounds like a cheap, interesting way to make money.

25:34.660 --> 25:37.700
But don't you, correct me if I'm wrong, Jamie, you're the one that's played Xbox

25:37.700 --> 25:39.660
online. I don't think anyone else here has.

25:39.660 --> 25:44.100
No, I watched Dan play it. But don't you have to... He's a street fighter.

25:44.100 --> 25:47.100
Don't you have to pay per month for that anyway?

25:47.100 --> 25:49.620
Xbox Live? Yeah.

25:49.620 --> 25:53.740
So now you're going to have to pay per month and pay per song you want to download? You shouldn't have to.

25:53.740 --> 25:55.880
I know, that's gay.

25:55.880 --> 25:58.280
It's called Licensing Rights, yay!

25:59.680 --> 26:01.840
Pretty soon there's going to be a Napster for DDR.

26:02.640 --> 26:07.780
Actually, why not?

26:07.780 --> 26:10.120
I mean, think about it, you're downloading a program.

26:10.120 --> 26:14.460
I mean, people could share programs online.

26:14.460 --> 26:15.120
I mean, why not?

26:16.000 --> 26:18.600
I'm sure they'll have a site where you can download them illegally.

26:20.880 --> 26:24.260
Anyway, also the producer of Ultramix says that there's going

26:24.260 --> 26:29.940
to be 55 songs planned for the US version, 10 of those licensed and if I'm not mistaking

26:29.940 --> 26:35.220
only 5 of them in Max USA were licensed so that's going to be interesting.

26:35.220 --> 26:39.620
And also kind of a big one, there's no Ultramix PC version.

26:39.620 --> 26:42.220
There was a big rumor that it was going to be out for the PC.

26:42.220 --> 26:43.780
That got shot down.

26:43.780 --> 26:49.580
The reason why I pretty much figured it wouldn't happen, there's already DDR PC.

26:49.580 --> 26:50.580
But it sucks.

26:50.580 --> 26:51.580
It really sucks.

26:51.580 --> 26:56.440
It does, true, but you know what Pump It Up for PC worked?

26:56.440 --> 26:57.440
Why?

26:57.440 --> 26:59.840
Because Pump It Up was made for a PC anyway.

26:59.840 --> 27:01.240
That's very true.

27:01.240 --> 27:05.980
It runs off the PC software anyways.

27:05.980 --> 27:09.320
All the big Pump It Up machine, that giant machine is, it's just there's little PC in

27:09.320 --> 27:11.360
there that runs everything.

27:11.360 --> 27:12.360
Yep.

27:12.360 --> 27:17.740
But, I don't know, I think, but you know, what's weird about DDRPC, look at StepMania.

27:17.740 --> 27:20.280
StepMania does it way better than DDRPC did.

27:20.280 --> 27:24.000
So it's kind of like you can't use the excuse that it's not possible to do on a computer

27:24.000 --> 27:28.800
because StepMania, hey, if they'd released something like that as DDRPC, I bet a lot

27:28.800 --> 27:31.600
of people would have been, you know, would have been, wow, this is great.

27:31.600 --> 27:32.600
Yeah.

27:32.600 --> 27:36.160
But they only have StepMania and then we'll go, oh, I'll just download all these songs

27:36.160 --> 27:38.600
or make my own that I think are better.

27:38.600 --> 27:44.680
Yeah, maybe, do you think that maybe that's why they've given up on DDRPC because of StepMania?

27:44.680 --> 27:47.200
I would probably think so.

27:47.200 --> 27:51.040
You know, how can you compete with something that's free?

27:51.040 --> 27:54.400
Why do you think Konami hasn't sued the people who made StepMania?

27:54.400 --> 27:55.480
Anybody want to venture a guess?

27:55.480 --> 28:04.280
I would think, well, first of all, the programming itself, if they did not reverse engineer it,

28:04.280 --> 28:08.940
if they actually made it right from scratch with their own source, they can't sue them

28:08.940 --> 28:09.940
for using...

28:09.940 --> 28:13.360
That's the whole problem with BLEAM, why they couldn't do BLEAM.

28:13.360 --> 28:16.680
Because they made their program for BLEAM from scratch.

28:16.680 --> 28:20.680
they sue for the whole look and feel thing though? I'm thinking back to, you remember

28:20.680 --> 28:25.140
when Street Fighter II was out and then I think some other third party company, I want

28:25.140 --> 28:30.880
to say Data East, put out a game called like Fighting Streets or something like that. Was

28:30.880 --> 28:35.280
it Fighter's History? Okay. They used the Street Fighter engine. And they got sued and

28:35.280 --> 28:39.060
all this stuff? I think it's because they used the Street Fighter engine. Did they?

28:39.060 --> 28:41.760
But I would think, you know, that whole look and feel thing will come to play. I mean obviously

28:41.760 --> 28:44.960
none of us want to see this step many people get sued, but you know it's just, it's a question

28:44.960 --> 28:48.420
that has to be asked. Why hasn't it happened yet? Especially if Konami wants to be competitive

28:48.420 --> 29:00.880
in the PC market. Angel. Yes, Angel. Puppy just pointed out in the chatroom that Step

29:00.880 --> 29:06.840
Mania is open source code, so I mean he's got a point there. Okay, that's a good point.

29:06.840 --> 29:14.840
Which is what Jamie just pointed out, so you know. It's open source, so even if they did

29:14.840 --> 29:20.740
get sued, it's kind of like, it doesn't matter at this point because the cat's already out

29:20.740 --> 29:25.740
of the bag.

29:25.740 --> 29:26.740
Interesting thought.

29:26.740 --> 29:30.860
How do you guys think the online play is going to work?

29:30.860 --> 29:33.380
Is there anything you guys would like to see online for DDR?

29:33.380 --> 29:38.500
Because I think that whole being able to play with somebody at the same time, it's kind

29:38.500 --> 29:40.940
of stupid because you can't see them.

29:40.940 --> 29:41.940
What would you see?

29:41.940 --> 29:46.300
the second side of your screen getting perfect good boo

29:46.300 --> 29:50.580
i think you'll see fifty wasted dollars coming out of your check everyone

29:50.580 --> 29:55.180
spending on xbox live the biggest piece of bullshit ever

29:55.180 --> 30:00.860
thank you for that happy comment mister brad

30:00.860 --> 30:04.240
uh...

30:04.240 --> 30:08.020
okay so we've got DDR xbox out of the way

30:08.020 --> 30:12.020
How about Karaoke Revolution? What do you guys think of this?

30:12.020 --> 30:13.160
This is kind of the...

30:13.160 --> 30:15.160
I hate karaoke, so...

30:15.160 --> 30:18.960
You hate karaoke? Yeah, because I don't sing, remember? I cry.

30:18.960 --> 30:22.920
I like watching other people so I can make fun of them, but I don't like doing it.

30:22.920 --> 30:25.300
This is interesting, though, because it's the first...

30:25.300 --> 30:30.640
it's kind of the first U.S.-only Bomani game.

30:30.640 --> 30:35.060
Kind of? Yeah, they haven't made any... well, I mean, they have games like it in Japan, but not Konami,

30:35.060 --> 30:37.580
and not in the Bomani series.

30:37.580 --> 30:40.880
I'm sorry? I thought they had a karaoke revolution machine or something.

30:40.880 --> 30:44.480
The closest thing they have to a karaoke revolution machine, I remember seeing

30:44.480 --> 30:47.560
this, it was a DDR slash karaoke machine.

30:47.560 --> 30:49.680
Yeah, it was like both.

30:49.680 --> 30:53.400
But who could follow that? You know what I saw at Network the other day?

30:53.400 --> 30:55.720
What? Aerobics Revolution.

30:55.720 --> 30:59.280
Oh yeah, that finally came out, huh? I was tempted to pick it up, but it was like

30:59.280 --> 31:01.500
seventy five dollars and more expensive.

31:01.500 --> 31:05.920
And if I was going to pay seventy five dollars in the game, I would have picked up Final Fantasy X-2.

31:05.920 --> 31:12.360
You know, it's like aerobics revolution wouldn't even be worth it. I saw a bunch of screenshots of it and it looks

31:13.120 --> 31:17.280
Really kind of odd loses. So this is the whole point. I mean really seriously

31:17.280 --> 31:23.620
It is like they just like they said you're doing some 80s James Fonda kind of kind of thing to it

31:23.620 --> 31:28.040
It's got like some chicks on it. You know, you're trying to follow their moves as you're stepping on the pad

31:28.040 --> 31:34.780
Well, you know basically yeah, you're doing aerobics stuff and you just so happen to be standing on a pad too while you're doing it

31:34.780 --> 31:43.400
What was that song that we figured out was confirmed for Karaoke Revolution?

31:43.400 --> 31:46.380
We figured out there's some Jennifer Love Hewitt song we figured out by the screen captures

31:46.380 --> 31:51.940
that's going to be in it for sure.

31:51.940 --> 31:54.820
We found out the other day and we forgot already.

31:54.820 --> 32:00.940
But Jennifer Love Hewitt was there at E3 singing.

32:00.940 --> 32:15.720
We are going to go ahead and take a quick break and when we come back we will talk about

32:15.720 --> 32:21.820
more of E3 and we will do the fuck you's of the week so you can send those to me over

32:21.820 --> 32:23.260
private messages in the chat room.

32:23.260 --> 32:26.740
My name is Sky and you can send those to me and if you are not in our chat room you should

32:26.740 --> 32:27.740
be.

32:27.740 --> 32:32.260
Go to www.calibomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on Chat.

32:32.260 --> 32:38.180
So we'll talk a little more about E3 and all that garbage when we get back.

32:38.180 --> 32:40.180
Enjoy!

33:08.180 --> 33:33.300
I feel it, I feel it, I feel it You are the only one, let's leave it all this way

33:33.300 --> 33:56.300
I feel it, I feel it, I feel it You are the only one that makes me feel this way

33:56.300 --> 34:03.300
Follow the sun, follow the sun And even the rain behind

34:03.300 --> 34:17.300
Together we'll be in harmony Taking the time, we will find our way

34:17.300 --> 34:26.300
Sometimes I feel your energy, I need some time But I'm on my way now

34:26.300 --> 34:30.300
Sometimes don't you hide away I want some time

34:30.300 --> 34:33.300
You should never stay

34:33.300 --> 34:47.300
I feel the energy I need sometimes

34:47.300 --> 34:50.300
But it's not on me now Sometimes

34:50.300 --> 34:53.300
Don't you hide away I want sometimes

34:53.300 --> 34:55.300
Each and every day Sometimes

34:55.300 --> 34:58.300
I feel the energy I need sometimes

34:58.300 --> 35:01.300
But it's not on me now Sometimes

35:01.300 --> 35:07.300
I'm going to hide away, I want some time, I'm feeling every day

35:31.300 --> 35:38.300
And that's the end of the video, thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.

37:01.300 --> 37:21.780
Welcome back, everybody.

37:21.780 --> 37:27.640
We decided to play some Happy Ray-var songs in that last break, so we hope you enjoyed.

37:27.640 --> 37:30.800
We also figured out what song it is that's going to be in Karaoke Revolutions, called

37:30.800 --> 37:32.760
Hey Everybody.

37:32.760 --> 37:36.560
It's from Jennifer Love Hewitt Gay.

37:36.560 --> 37:39.920
And I'm sure it sucks, but how did you find that song?

37:39.920 --> 37:45.400
Based off of the lyrics that are showing the screen caps on the Konami website, actually.

37:45.400 --> 37:51.400
They have a few pictures up that are from the E3 showings, so I've got it off of that.

37:51.400 --> 37:55.400
And then you did a lyric search and there you go. Amazing.

37:55.400 --> 38:04.400
But, um, it was during the break, somebody, I think it was, I don't know if it was Garrett or somebody commented that the chick in Karaoke Revolution in the screenshots looks like an American Idol reject.

38:04.400 --> 38:10.400
She actually, you know what she looks like? Has anybody ever played the Spice World video game for PlayStation?

38:10.400 --> 38:12.400
Oh God, that game sucks.

38:12.400 --> 38:17.960
When they have the giant head and the little anorexic body, that's what that chick looked

38:17.960 --> 38:18.960
like to me.

38:18.960 --> 38:22.320
I'm hoping everybody was moaning and groaning because they haven't played it and they're

38:22.320 --> 38:25.320
sad that you're the only one who has.

38:25.320 --> 38:26.320
Don't cry for me.

38:26.320 --> 38:29.520
I don't want to know that all these people have played the Spice World game.

38:29.520 --> 38:30.520
I know your girlfriend has.

38:30.520 --> 38:34.680
I had a free rental and I wanted to see how bad it was.

38:34.680 --> 38:35.680
Get this.

38:35.680 --> 38:41.640
The first time I met my ex-girlfriend, the very first day I meet her, she's like, hm?

38:41.640 --> 38:47.640
She said, you know, you have to see this game, and so I'm like, oh no, Spice World, what is this?

38:47.640 --> 38:52.640
And then she showed me what was so funny about it, and yeah, it was pretty funny, but you guys must have been really drunk

38:52.640 --> 38:56.640
when you first saw that game, right? Or when you thought about buying that game, Rob. You had to be drunk.

38:56.640 --> 38:58.640
Oh, that's right, Rob owns that game, right?

38:58.640 --> 39:07.640
I do own that game. It's in a deep... I think it's in my closet. I'm going to have to go take it out at some point.

39:07.640 --> 39:11.300
uh... so you know what else is an lc greater rather get what about other cool

39:11.300 --> 39:14.520
games is non balmani necessarily that you're looking forward to

39:14.520 --> 39:17.860
i know brad had one

39:17.860 --> 39:20.980
brad tell me about some games you're looking forward to the agree not

39:20.980 --> 39:22.420
necessarily the money

39:22.420 --> 39:24.140
uh...

39:24.140 --> 39:26.140
can only suffer just anything

39:26.140 --> 39:29.100
and anything okay uh... half-life to

39:29.100 --> 39:30.340
uh...

39:30.340 --> 39:31.780
no you're sold three

39:31.780 --> 39:36.780
The weird voice acting?

39:36.780 --> 39:38.780
What's the weird voice acting?

39:38.780 --> 39:40.780
What's the weird voice acting?

39:40.780 --> 39:45.780
Yes, but it's not as bad as DIE, MONSTER. You don't belong in this world.

39:45.780 --> 39:49.780
They need to do another Dracula X game with Richter.

39:49.780 --> 39:54.780
A new Gradius game, definitely. Mario Kart Double Dash.

39:54.780 --> 39:59.780
There's a new Sam & Max game.

39:59.780 --> 40:00.780
Really?

40:00.780 --> 40:05.780
New Sam & Max game, New Full Throttle game from LucasArts.

40:05.780 --> 40:09.780
Who cares about that game?

40:09.780 --> 40:15.780
Uh, let's see what else. There's, um... I don't know. There's cool games.

40:15.780 --> 40:18.780
Mario Party 5, bitches.

40:18.780 --> 40:24.780
Mario Adv- Mario Advance 4, Super Mario Bros. 3.

40:24.780 --> 40:29.780
Or the new, um, Pokemon Stadium on GameCube.

40:29.780 --> 40:31.780
Huh? Huh?

40:31.780 --> 40:33.780
Metroid Pro Mission.

40:33.780 --> 40:36.780
Oh, yeah, the new Metroid!

40:36.780 --> 40:38.780
Really?

40:38.780 --> 40:45.780
really

40:46.460 --> 40:47.800
neopets

40:47.800 --> 40:51.680
or that's right in coming out on the issue

40:51.680 --> 40:52.940
of god

40:52.940 --> 40:55.260
the world is ending

40:55.260 --> 40:59.740
the end of a million copies of that army game

40:59.740 --> 41:02.100
that's not really an army put out

41:02.100 --> 41:04.600
the u s army another game

41:04.600 --> 41:07.600
they put out a game on pc a while back uh...

41:07.600 --> 41:14.600
to

41:37.600 --> 41:40.760
Doom 3 is gonna be horrible

41:40.760 --> 41:44.360
says somebody. Doom 3 is gonna be horrible

41:44.360 --> 41:49.080
Why is Doom 3 gonna be horrible?

41:49.080 --> 41:52.480
I don't know. Because the person doesn't like first-person shooters? I don't know.

41:52.480 --> 41:56.000
That's fine. If you don't like first-person shooters, I don't expect you to like it, but as far as first-person shooters

41:56.000 --> 41:57.600
concerned, it's gonna be freakin' great.

41:57.600 --> 42:01.160
I played the Alpha League. It is incredible.

42:01.160 --> 42:04.600
It runs like shit on my computer, but it's great. This is the justification.

42:04.600 --> 42:07.600
No multiplayer, and it's going to be completely linear.

42:07.600 --> 42:13.600
Well, Brad, then play Unreal Tournament or Quake 3.

42:13.600 --> 42:15.600
That's what those are for.

42:15.600 --> 42:18.600
They make Doom for online play. They never did in the first place.

42:18.600 --> 42:23.600
The reason why Doom 3 is going to be shitty is because they've spent too goddamn long on it.

42:23.600 --> 42:26.600
I am 20.

42:26.600 --> 42:32.600
I remember my friend showing me previews of this when they had, you know, like at conventions with movies of it,

42:32.600 --> 42:44.600
When I was a sophomore in high school, it's kind of gotten outdated because when they had their brilliant engine back then and it looked gorgeous, now it looks like shit.

42:44.600 --> 42:54.600
It still does look gorgeous. I mean, that happens with a lot of games. Look at Dragon Quest VII. That has been in the making for five, six years.

42:54.600 --> 43:11.120
I actually had an issue of New Type where they had a review of Dragon Quest VII that

43:11.120 --> 43:17.080
was two years old.

43:17.080 --> 43:22.120
I want them to do like another Secret of Mana using sprites.

43:22.120 --> 43:26.120
Oh, then again, we have Ragnarok, so what else do we need?

43:26.120 --> 43:44.120
Yeah, Sword of Mana, which, like, they call it over here, it's the redo of the Seiken Densetsu game, the first one that was called Final Fantasy Adventure on Game Boy, which is a great game, you know, but this one looks, they updated it to make it look more like Seiken Densetsu 3, so, mmm, looks awesome.

43:44.120 --> 43:49.620
That's what I need to say, Condensa23. I'm a GBA. That'd make me happy.

43:49.620 --> 43:52.120
All they need to do is slap the ROM on there, there you go.

43:52.120 --> 43:59.620
Yeah, well, they do have the Flash Advance cards, if you want to spend like $250 just for the little ROM cartridge,

43:59.620 --> 44:07.620
and then you can load ROMs with a front-loader programmer, not front-loader, a front-end program that'll emulate the ROMs for you.

44:07.620 --> 44:13.060
I heard some other hardware things I heard about from E3, they're going to have something

44:13.060 --> 44:16.940
they're releasing for the GBA where you can watch full motion video for like 30 minutes

44:16.940 --> 44:17.940
on a cartridge.

44:17.940 --> 44:22.420
Yeah, they have that already in Japan, you can get it from lick-sang.com.

44:22.420 --> 44:26.740
But I always get it whenever I hear that website, lick-sang, sounds like something in an Asian

44:26.740 --> 44:27.740
porno.

44:27.740 --> 44:28.740
Lick my sang.

44:28.740 --> 44:34.420
No, but yeah, you can get it from there, and I guess that means they're releasing it here

44:34.420 --> 44:35.420
if it was at E3.

44:35.420 --> 44:36.420
That's pretty interesting.

44:36.420 --> 44:44.420
You know one thing I saw at Network yesterday was the Game Boy Advance player for the GameCube.

44:44.420 --> 44:45.420
I want me one of those.

44:45.420 --> 44:50.420
It's pretty cool. It sits on the bottom of it though. It's kind of weird.

44:50.420 --> 44:54.420
I think there's some comments wanting to be made in the corner that haven't been made yet.

44:54.420 --> 44:55.420
Jamie and I are whirring it.

44:55.420 --> 44:57.420
That's okay.

44:57.420 --> 44:58.420
I think it's trapped in the corner.

44:58.420 --> 45:12.420
Well, Brad, while we were still on that topic, and not trampling it flat, if you like your single-player, first-person, linear shooters, you can go to hell. You know what? I like them. I'll join you.

45:12.420 --> 45:19.420
I don't think I get it. I can go to hell and you'll join me? What was your point? You like linear or you don't?

45:19.420 --> 45:20.420
Ah, he's making it Doom.

45:20.420 --> 45:38.420
I remember being in college, right after graduation, going to my friend Marcy's house and playing Doom, and we'd all be like,

45:38.420 --> 45:45.420
hurt me plenty! Thinking we were all badass. We just thought we were awesome because we could play on Nightmare.

45:45.420 --> 45:53.420
You know, I hate to bring this up again, but why is it that I did not know, I swear I did not know, any girls that played video games until after I was out of college, long after I was out of college.

45:53.420 --> 45:55.420
I played video games all throughout when I was in high school.

45:55.420 --> 45:57.420
How come I didn't have friends like you?

45:57.420 --> 45:59.420
Because you suck.

45:59.420 --> 46:06.420
I think I was just too preppy or something, and all my friends were in a band and cheerleading and stuff.

46:06.420 --> 46:14.420
I worked in an arcade. I was the only girl who played Tekken 3. It was Namco Arcade, so we had Tekken 3 before everybody else.

46:14.420 --> 46:17.420
And weren't you known as the girl who played Tekken 3 who kicked all our asses?

46:17.420 --> 46:19.420
I was known as the girl who played Tekken 3 who kicked all their asses.

46:19.420 --> 46:22.420
I went online on DDR Freak one day.

46:22.420 --> 46:26.420
I was randomly IMing, PMing somebody because this was right before I was going to Alabama,

46:26.420 --> 46:30.420
trying to see who all the people were to play so I could meet up with some of them.

46:30.420 --> 46:35.420
Because all they had in my belt at the time was a dance maniacs machine, which is the Korean crappy one.

46:35.420 --> 46:37.420
I go, I forgot who else I could tell.

46:37.420 --> 46:40.420
I was like, yeah, I used to work at the Namco arcade.

46:40.420 --> 46:45.140
Weren't you that girl who used to beat everybody at Tekken 3?

46:45.140 --> 46:48.060
And this is five years later, no, four years later.

46:48.060 --> 46:49.060
The legacy.

46:49.060 --> 46:51.540
But the legend still burns.

46:51.540 --> 46:53.540
Oh please.

46:53.540 --> 47:00.740
I went back to that cyber station though and like proceeded to, it's funny seeing all these

47:00.740 --> 47:04.180
people just sort of slapping at the dance maniacs machine and then I'm playing like,

47:04.180 --> 47:05.180
you know, Miggle style.

47:05.180 --> 47:06.180
It was funny.

47:06.180 --> 47:10.100
And then so, we got a bunch of girl gamers in the room, that's cool.

47:10.100 --> 47:12.100
How long have you been playing video games, Marron?

47:13.100 --> 47:16.100
I've been playing video games since I was 10.

47:16.100 --> 47:24.100
That's so cool. What was the first video game you remember playing?

47:24.100 --> 47:27.100
Super Mario Brothers 2.

47:27.100 --> 47:30.100
And then Legend of Zelda.

47:30.100 --> 47:32.100
Very cool.

47:32.100 --> 47:34.100
I know what my first one was.

47:34.100 --> 47:35.100
What?

47:35.100 --> 47:37.100
My first game was Pitfall.

47:37.100 --> 47:40.040
on these hard choices hundred uh... i think about my neighbors across the

47:40.040 --> 47:45.060
street were girls and they love that game they made a plan and um... kangaroo

47:45.060 --> 47:46.300
kangaroo is shitty

47:46.300 --> 47:48.940
uh... by me i don't think that

47:48.940 --> 47:53.580
i played kangaroo in an arcadia godfather's pizza

47:53.580 --> 47:55.100
so hot

47:55.100 --> 47:56.040
i'm older

47:56.040 --> 47:59.740
i remember playing a brand new donkey kong machine

47:59.740 --> 48:02.960
i remember playing a cocktail machine and now and you i would expect to be

48:02.960 --> 48:04.740
playing kongo bongo

48:04.740 --> 48:05.460
never played it

48:05.460 --> 48:08.460
because it's the Sega thing, but whatever. I figure maybe start a young age.

48:08.460 --> 48:11.460
I played Space Fury and Gorf on my Colecovision.

48:11.460 --> 48:14.460
I was going to ask Angel, since she's a girl gamer, too.

48:14.460 --> 48:15.460
Yeah.

48:15.460 --> 48:17.460
First one you remember playing.

48:17.460 --> 48:21.460
Oh, God. It was either... Shit. What was it called?

48:21.460 --> 48:23.460
The damn computer won.

48:23.460 --> 48:26.460
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

48:26.460 --> 48:30.460
The computer... No, it was Commodore. Fuck.

48:30.460 --> 48:33.460
It was like between Commodore and Atari 2600

48:33.460 --> 48:41.460
I've been playing since I was 3, so yeah, I've been geeky since I was 3.

48:41.460 --> 48:44.460
Now this topic doesn't have to stay just for the girls, what about guys?

48:44.460 --> 48:47.460
Now I'm in this reminiscing mode, what was the first video game you remember playing?

48:47.460 --> 48:54.460
Another girl! I was born with a controller in my hand! I've been playing games forever!

48:54.460 --> 49:02.460
I was either like 4 or 5 and it was either Super Mario Brothers or Metroid, I can't remember, it was like at my neighbor's house.

49:02.460 --> 49:07.460
Then I got my Nintendo when I was in kindergarten, and I was a freak from then on.

49:07.460 --> 49:09.820
I had a Nintendo jacket in the fourth grade.

49:09.820 --> 49:10.820
I owned you.

49:10.820 --> 49:11.820
Dork!

49:11.820 --> 49:14.500
That's why the girls didn't talk to you.

49:14.500 --> 49:16.660
It's not because...

49:16.660 --> 49:21.140
But, did you ever get a hold of Super Mario Bros. cereal?

49:21.140 --> 49:25.140
Yes, Super Mario Bros. cereal was the shit.

49:25.140 --> 49:26.140
What is going on?

49:26.140 --> 49:27.140
Why is it really me?

49:27.140 --> 49:28.140
What is she saying here?

49:28.140 --> 49:29.140
It's...

49:29.140 --> 49:30.140
It's...

49:30.140 --> 49:31.140
Put Jamie on a mic.

49:31.140 --> 49:38.140
Put Jamie on the mic and explain what they're eating.

50:01.140 --> 50:03.140
No.

50:03.140 --> 50:05.140
Or he goes, ouch.

50:05.140 --> 50:07.140
And then he flies away.

50:07.140 --> 50:09.140
And see, it had that giant trackball thing.

50:09.140 --> 50:13.140
So one could say I was attracted to balls at a young age.

50:13.140 --> 50:15.140
Wha, wha, wha?

50:15.140 --> 50:17.140
Oh, god, we just lost half our listeners.

50:17.140 --> 50:19.140
What do you know?

50:19.140 --> 50:21.140
And gained some new ones.

50:21.140 --> 50:23.140
Ew, it looks like...

50:23.140 --> 50:26.140
I'm not going to eat it. It's gross looking.

50:26.140 --> 50:28.140
Give me some squid.

50:28.140 --> 50:30.140
It smells like punani.

50:30.140 --> 50:32.140
I'm gonna eat it live on the air.

50:32.140 --> 50:33.140
Alright.

50:33.140 --> 50:35.640
Uh, I think now's a good time to get into the-

50:35.640 --> 50:37.140
Wait, does anybody want to reminisce first games?

50:37.140 --> 50:38.140
Because we didn't get to everybody.

50:38.140 --> 50:39.140
Dark Tetsuya?

50:39.140 --> 50:42.140
It does smell like Tetsuya.

50:42.140 --> 50:44.140
Well, you know, you just...

50:44.140 --> 50:46.140
Actually, this kind of...

50:46.140 --> 50:48.140
It kind of reminds me of beef jerky.

50:48.140 --> 50:49.140
Got it.

50:49.140 --> 50:51.140
My favorite is beef jerky.

50:51.140 --> 50:53.140
As for games, oh god, I don't know.

50:53.140 --> 50:54.140
Fast food.

50:54.140 --> 50:55.140
2600.

50:55.140 --> 50:56.140
Oh!

50:56.140 --> 50:59.140
Was that the one where you're the little chef, and like, if you lost, then all the food

50:59.140 --> 51:06.140
the food would get thrown at you for size? No, no, no. Your little purple mouth thingy.

51:07.220 --> 51:08.960
Tappin'.

51:08.960 --> 51:13.260
Oh. Ooh! Rob, did you see what he did?

51:13.260 --> 51:15.620
You got me, you just got me and Brian confused, didn't you?

51:15.620 --> 51:20.620
No, no, I said Rob, did you see what he did? Oh, what'd he do?

51:20.620 --> 51:25.620
You better watch out or else there's some pussy at you.

51:25.620 --> 51:30.020
Alright, let's finish up the others in the room.

51:30.020 --> 51:31.020
Eat the squid!

51:31.020 --> 51:33.620
Fine, I'll eat the squid, but you gotta give the mic to Angel and the others so they can

51:33.620 --> 51:34.620
finish it.

51:34.620 --> 51:35.620
You have to eat the squid before I do that.

51:35.620 --> 51:36.620
Alright, it looks nasty.

51:36.620 --> 51:37.940
You know what it looks like?

51:37.940 --> 51:50.220
It looks like Big League 2.

51:50.220 --> 51:52.500
This is horrible radio.

51:52.500 --> 51:54.500
AHHH!

51:54.500 --> 51:56.500
This is horrible radio!

51:56.500 --> 51:58.500
Give the mic to somebody in the back.

51:58.500 --> 52:00.500
Yup, leave.

52:00.500 --> 52:02.500
Magus, first game.

52:02.500 --> 52:08.500
Words could not express...

52:08.500 --> 52:16.500
Words could not express what Rob is going through right now.

52:16.500 --> 52:20.500
This is bad radio, tell me your first game.

52:20.500 --> 52:24.500
Oh, it tastes like burning!

52:24.500 --> 52:27.500
Burnination, yes.

52:27.500 --> 52:37.500
I'm probably the youngest here, but I still remember playing kangaroo when I was three, and then moving on to burger time when I was five.

52:37.500 --> 52:45.500
Then it was duck cut, and then it's all downhill from there.

52:45.500 --> 52:48.500
Mokey, did you get to reminisce about your first video game you remember?

53:15.500 --> 53:22.500
Smurfs, I used to love the Smurfs game, because that was easy.

53:22.500 --> 53:23.500
The Smurfs game was weird.

53:23.500 --> 53:30.500
I used to love to make the Smurfs fall, because they're stupid.

53:30.500 --> 53:31.500
What else?

53:31.500 --> 53:33.500
There was this one that, I can't remember.

53:33.500 --> 53:35.500
I have a trackball.

53:35.500 --> 53:39.500
But yeah, pretty much just Frenzy was cool.

53:39.500 --> 53:40.500
Oh!

53:40.500 --> 53:41.500
Ooh!

53:41.500 --> 53:42.500
Jumpman!

53:42.500 --> 53:44.500
I love Jumpman.

53:44.500 --> 53:51.500
So Rob, now that you've had squid, do you feel like...

53:52.500 --> 53:56.500
Okay, I'm going to share this real fast, and we're going to get into the nephews of the week.

53:56.500 --> 53:58.500
I've had, what is it, calamari?

53:58.500 --> 54:02.500
I love calamari, it's good. That, not good.

54:02.500 --> 54:04.500
That's like beef jerky, but it's squid.

54:04.500 --> 54:06.500
How can you, I'm just watching Mira and she's just like,

54:06.500 --> 54:09.500
Um, nope, nope, she's just eating it, mmm, this is good shit.

54:09.500 --> 54:11.500
It's nasty!

54:11.500 --> 54:16.500
Mmm, beefy, but more like squid-y.

54:16.500 --> 54:18.500
More like pussy!

54:18.500 --> 54:24.500
I'm expecting it to, like, explode in my mouth or something. Anyway, I'm glad nobody caught that.

54:24.500 --> 54:36.500
Alright, alright, let's settle down, children, because it's time for Jamie to burninate with the, uh, FUs of the week.

54:36.500 --> 54:40.500
But the soul, the soul still burninates.

54:40.500 --> 54:42.500
My mouth is full of squid.

54:42.500 --> 54:44.500
Alright, you ready, Jamie?

54:44.500 --> 54:45.500
No.

54:45.500 --> 54:50.500
Since it's our season premiere, we should remind the listeners what the FUs of the week are all about.

54:50.500 --> 54:53.500
It's where we take all the shit that pisses us off and say, fuck you.

54:53.500 --> 54:54.500
Okay.

54:54.500 --> 54:55.500
How was that?

54:55.500 --> 55:03.500
The chat room is begging and pleading us to keep it under control this week and not go on for an hour, so.

55:03.500 --> 55:06.060
So let's try and regulate ourselves, boys and girls.

55:06.060 --> 55:09.980
If you hesitate, if you hesitate too much on your FUs, the mic goes on the next person.

55:09.980 --> 55:10.980
Agreed?

55:10.980 --> 55:11.980
All right.

55:11.980 --> 55:12.980
Here we go.

55:12.980 --> 55:13.980
Here we go.

55:13.980 --> 55:31.340
Um, my thank you of the week goes to Rob.

55:31.340 --> 55:32.340
Thank you.

55:32.340 --> 55:49.340
It would make you more proud to know that I was talking on my cell phone when I parked.

55:49.340 --> 56:05.340
Another fikey goes to Julie's car for smelling like dust and rotten milk and for having no working air conditioning. Or a radio that lets us change the station. Or a rear view mirror. So I had a rear view mirror and it was the side mirror. The passenger side mirror.

56:05.340 --> 56:10.260
Thank you goes toward getting lost in San Francisco actually just toward the

56:10.260 --> 56:15.960
whole street system in San Francisco and then toward like you know not being able

56:15.960 --> 56:21.700
to get Final Fantasy 10 to network videos and also toward the city of

56:21.700 --> 56:27.780
Milpitas for being weird for having like one entrance off of 101 and another one

56:27.780 --> 56:34.780
off of 680 and had me turn around and have a nap. And then another one goes toward um

56:34.780 --> 56:44.860
stuff. The end. And another, that's my hiccups. They're burpee hiccups, they hurt. Ew, are

56:44.860 --> 56:54.740
you burping? Alright. That's it then? Uh huh. Okay, moving on to Loki. Oh wait, one more.

56:54.740 --> 57:01.740
Triscuit, we're giving you the phantom taste of cheese, but not really being cheesed.

57:24.740 --> 57:31.740
Pier 39 is a waste of time, it's just like expensive shit, and how many stores do you really need as souvenirs for San Francisco?

57:31.740 --> 57:35.740
I can go to any store there and buy the same shit. It really sucks.

57:35.740 --> 57:43.740
So after that, after you do my freaking cold, because, you know, I hate being sick, and all I smell is snot.

57:43.740 --> 57:48.740
I've smelled snot for about four days now, and that's all I smell. It's like this nasty ammonia smell.

57:48.740 --> 57:53.740
All day long, that's all I smell is goddamn snot. Okay?

57:53.740 --> 58:05.740
After the stupid British chick that was performing up on the, like, uh, on the water stage, whatever that stupid stage was there, she was freaking stupid.

58:05.740 --> 58:15.740
Her and her, like, gypsy child, I mean, freaking doing these acts up there, and people just didn't give a shit, they're just sitting there going, okay, what's the next thing on, what's the next thing on?

58:15.740 --> 58:18.740
And then people were yelling for her to get off the stage and she's just like,

58:18.740 --> 58:20.740
Oh, how do you like?

58:20.740 --> 58:21.740
Oh, kid.

58:21.740 --> 58:22.740
No, clap your whistle.

58:22.740 --> 58:24.740
And it's just, it was annoying.

58:24.740 --> 58:27.740
It was god-awful.

58:27.740 --> 58:32.740
After using the refrigerator for having a stupid plug in the bottom there

58:32.740 --> 58:35.740
and water being there, and I didn't know what the plug was for,

58:35.740 --> 58:37.740
so I didn't want the water in the refrigerator,

58:37.740 --> 58:40.740
so I pulled the plug, not thinking that the plug doesn't go anywhere

58:40.740 --> 58:42.740
except down to the floor.

58:42.740 --> 58:47.740
So now the floor is flooded with water from the stupid refrigerator and that sucks.

58:47.740 --> 58:51.740
Um, F you to B3 for not giving me a freakin' badge.

58:51.740 --> 58:55.740
I mean, God damn it, I fuckin' set up a bunch of shit for you guys.

58:55.740 --> 58:59.740
Like the whole, like, you know, feed for that stupid camera and all that shit.

58:59.740 --> 59:01.740
I got the damn CAT5 cable.

59:01.740 --> 59:06.740
I just spent my own God damn money to buy 50 feet of CAT5 I'm never gonna ever use again.

59:06.740 --> 59:09.740
And, God damn it, you couldn't even give me a fucking badge?

59:09.740 --> 59:11.740
What is wrong with you people?

59:11.740 --> 59:14.940
and seriously and after that oh give me a free t-shirt yeah sure i really saw

59:14.940 --> 59:16.940
that one i had to go buy my goddamn t-shirt

59:16.940 --> 59:21.180
i don't give a shit whatever so that was awful i had to

59:21.180 --> 59:25.420
carry my goddamn stuff two blocks to your goddamn freaking arcade which

59:25.420 --> 59:29.260
sucked because that overpriced shit all your games suck your stupid time

59:29.260 --> 59:33.820
crisis games suck your stupid fucking um got it i can't

59:33.820 --> 59:36.940
remember it's a stupid gun game that the goddamn

59:36.940 --> 59:41.660
thing wasn't calibrated right i'm firing off the screen and saying dead center

59:41.660 --> 59:45.660
That was, uh, yeah, House of the Dead, because I wanted to play that.

59:45.660 --> 59:47.660
Yeah, House of the Dead fucking sucks.

59:47.660 --> 59:50.660
By the way, though, your initial being a machine was the shit.

59:50.660 --> 59:52.660
Yeah, but everything else was shit, okay?

59:52.660 --> 59:55.660
Boy, there was that goddamn huge...

59:55.660 --> 59:58.660
The roller coaster machine was the shit.

59:58.660 --> 01:00:04.660
And what the hell is that? We're having, like, a stupid shooting rage right next to where we're frickin' performing for frickin' DDR.

01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:05.660
So every now and then you hear this,

01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:07.660
YEAH!

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:09.660
And people are like, what the hell's that screaming noise?

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:10.660
So that sucked.

01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:16.660
And finally, the biggest one of them all, the biggest F.D. of the week, is going to PayPal.

01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:20.660
PayPal overcharged my account by $600 fucking dollars.

01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:23.660
Okay, beware of PayPal.

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:32.660
I wanted to pay for an auction that was $5.99 plus $4.25 shipping for a grand total of $10.24.

01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:33.660
What did I get?

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:41.660
I had it instead charge me $599 and 425 shipping for a grand total of $603.25.

01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:47.660
There's nothing that PayPal can do, so I had to end up contacting my guy, which made my account overdraft,

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:57.660
which also caused a bunch of my other auctions to overdraft my account even more, so now I have to pay finance charges of about $180.

01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:07.660
I have to sell off my DVD collection to fix that. Thank you PayPal for ruining my whole fucking week.

01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:32.660
And the thing is, if you're sick on a weekday, that's cool because you can miss work.

01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:38.660
But being sick on a weekend, that just sucks because now you have to work and you have to waste your weekend lying in bed going,

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:41.660
I hate my life and I want to die.

01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:44.660
But I do have a good point out of all this.

01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:47.660
Coldies, whoever invented coldies, pure fucking genius.

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:51.660
I'm already on the other end of my cold and I was never like super duper ill.

01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:54.660
Coldies are the bomb and I recommend everybody take them.

01:01:54.660 --> 01:02:01.660
You should have been listening to me from day one, because I've always told you just take zinc and vitamin C and you'll feel better. That's exactly what's in that shit.

01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:02.660
Yeah, I know.

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:08.660
But it's called coldies, and it tastes like cherries.

01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:14.660
No, they do taste like butt. I'll agree.

01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:18.660
It tastes like the shitty rear end of a SARS victim.

01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:22.660
Yeah, F you to the taste of coldies. That's awful.

01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:28.660
Alright, let's move on to the other folks in the room, starting off with Maren!

01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:35.660
I would like to say F you to my car, since the alternator, like, exploded or something and we had to replace it.

01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:40.660
F you to McCarran International Airport for making me take off my shoes so they could x-ray them.

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:45.660
And F you to guys who step on your feet and do not apologize and are rude.

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:48.660
And that's about it. Other than that, it was a good week.

01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:54.660
Yeah, and the guys who step on your feet and smell bad and can't work the soft serve ice cream machine.

01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:57.660
So yeah.

01:02:57.660 --> 01:03:03.660
Let's move on. I'm going to move on and get Brad to go here.

01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:06.660
Is this my song?

01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:08.660
It's a different song every week.

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:15.660
Anyway, I have to go to sailors because, I mean, I love Varian's dad and all, but he wanted to play.

01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:43.660
he was in the navy, you know, he's retired. He played, he had to do a drinking game, sailor style, like sailor rules, and you had 60 seconds to drink your shot, and he went in a round of three people. And I probably had somewhere around 11 or 12 shots in the round last night. And I didn't get sobered up until about 2 p.m. today. So, sailor stuff, there we go.

01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:44.660
Yes.

01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:45.660
Dead air!

01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:46.660
Oh, sorry.

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:47.660
Ah.

01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:48.660
My...

01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:49.660
Okay, okay.

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:56.320
My FUD goes to not having that stupid DWI finish I wanted in the Season 3 premiere.

01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:59.700
I was hoping to have it finished by then.

01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:03.320
And F not being able to sleeve, because I had nowhere to sleeve, but that was probably

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:04.320
my fault.

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.320
So, yeah.

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:06.320
FUD to myself.

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.320
Okay.

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:08.320
Angel.

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:11.320
I'd like to say FUD to my boss again, because he almost said he was going to be dead.

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:15.320
I'd like to say F.U. to my boss again because she's almost in Gimmie the weekend off.

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:16.320
Ow.

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.320
I gave him that flash.

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:21.320
F.U. to the flash.

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:23.320
Um, yeah, okay.

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:27.320
Yeah, so I almost didn't get to come here, see?

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:28.320
That wasn't good.

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:30.320
So, F.U. to that.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:33.320
Alright, moving on to Magus.

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:38.320
Yeah, first of all, F.U. to the Sacramento R.T. bus system.

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:43.980
They don't know how to run their bus throughout Arden. We were trying to get from my high school

01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:48.600
To Arden for a mall go see like make some love and stuff

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:53.120
Apparently we make it to the light rail station and

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:55.520
well

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:57.520
Bus does a show for an hour and a half

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:01.960
so we took the long walk from Arden Fulton to

01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:05.480
The mall

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:07.480
in the burning heat

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:28.480
Second of all, we leave on Thursday right before Memorial Day weekend. We expect no one to be on the road. We're an hour and a half late coming into the Bay Area.

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:31.480
Fuck those stupid drivers!

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:34.480
When again, we were one of the stupid drivers.

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:35.480
Math.

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:36.480
Naturalist.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:37.480
He was.

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:42.480
A few of the Chinese food places that play Outbreak while you're trying to eat.

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:45.480
That's kind of funny.

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:47.480
I don't know if I give an FU, that's funny.

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:50.480
A Chinese food place that plays Outbreak, the movie Outbreak.

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:54.480
It happened to be Silver Garden, thank you very much.

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:55.480
Here we go.

01:05:55.480 --> 01:06:02.480
cuz he forgot them cuz they were fucked up

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.980
Okay, let's move on to the chatroom FUs then.

01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:30.980
Hey, not bad you guys, I only took 20 minutes to get through ours.

01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:33.280
Usually it takes an hour.

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:36.980
Okay, Mandarin would like to say,

01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:40.580
fuck the Orange Lounge radio host that don't wish me a happy birthday.

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:41.980
Happy birthday.

01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:44.180
Today's her birthday.

01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:45.880
Happy birthday.

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:49.580
Well, FU for not being here to get spankings, girl.

01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:53.780
Fuck stupid managers at Yardbirds that make my girlfriend work on my birthday.

01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:56.640
fuck real radio stations like ninety four nine whoever played this song

01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:58.000

uh... let's see fuck people who say fuck too fucking much

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:03.400

but my roommates ex-girlfriend because she's a controlling bitch

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:11.640
who won't let my roommate be gay or at least trying as hard as she can

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:12.720

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.720

uh... justin b would like to say f you to rob and jamie at the beginning of the

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:26.700
show when Jamie was coughing up her lungs. Because the comment you made and Jamie coughing

01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:35.700
made me spit soda slash hot dog out of my mouth. And now we just had a laugh at your

01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:45.960
expense. That was the win. Ninst would like to say F56K connections who keep buffering

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:51.180
Orange Lounge Radio. Stupid kids who think they can play DDR when they can't pass beginner

01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:54.860
their songs, moving out at the end of the college year, my professor from my coding

01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:59.260
class, he didn't show up with a final until an hour after he should have, one more time

01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:04.040
my modem and being a 56k connection, people who decide to take slow drives on country

01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:08.800
roads on Sundays, you drive too slow and keep other people from where they need to be, people

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:13.700
who don't like Matrix Reloaded, they had to think somewhat because they had to think somewhat,

01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:18.260
and to close it off my 56k connection to my ISP should die, oh one more, F you to my brother's

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:22.640

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:26.460
on everything. Why can't there be a decent electronic shop around here?

01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:30.620
That was two more. Yeah, that was like two or three more. God,

01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:34.460

fuck horrible sleep cycles fuck boredom and laziness

01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:13.300
i spent about ninety percent of this weekend thus far sitting on my computer

01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:17.780
but the he writing a bike across town in ninety five degree heat is not fun

01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:21.700
but the holiday for keeping the dining halls closed next today so i can't be the

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:24.740

01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:31.740
like you get a decent meal in dorms anyway what's up with that

01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:33.080
moving on

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.880
john fields would like to say

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:38.220
f u sony for making the p s two with such cheap parts

01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:41.660
discrete error discrete error i'm so freaking tired of turning my playstation

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:46.300
2 upside down and spinning it all around to get it to read the disc. Also FU to server

01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:50.500
ops to take their job way too seriously and let nothing go by and then lying about giving

01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:54.880
warnings and thus ban someone without them realizing what they were doing was wrong despite

01:09:54.880 --> 01:10:04.600
of how insignificant the problem was. Vandalus would like to say an FU. FU to my Cadillac

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:09.760
for having a leaky radiator.

01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:14.960
Arkadian42 would like to say fuck you to the person who scraped my rear car door in the

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:17.900
Scandia parking lot and dented it in slightly.

01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:20.800
Now the window of that door won't go down all the way anymore.

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:24.560
Fucking hit and run bitches.

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:29.020
And lastly, Muhimer would like to say fuck me for not being here and submitting late.

01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:32.280
Fuck not having the internet for two weeks because of McGaffey Firewall.

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:33.280
Fuck homophobes.

01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:38.000
But yay for 50 Cent DDR Extreme, 10 minutes away finally, oh, and thank God for acupuncture

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.840
curing my allergies.

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:41.240
Allergies.

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:46.600
Hooray, that's everybody's F.U. of the Week.

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:50.880
So, any last bits of bitterness?

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:55.320
Loki, you have something new that's going to be coming to the show that I see you just

01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:56.320
got?

01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:59.200
Do you want to share with our listeners what you just want?

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:05.200
Yeah, I actually found this when I was looking for Dance Sense Revolution stuff.

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:11.200
You know, normally I look for the arcade discs and stuff, and this just happened to be pulled up in an eBay auction.

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:21.200
So, I won a hentai cosplay, actually it's a cosplay porn featuring DDR characters.

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:28.200
So yes, we have DDR porn.

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:30.200
Will we get to play that on the show?

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.200
Of course.

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:33.200
Yay!

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:34.200
Oh, yay.

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.200
Don't sound too excited, Jamie.

01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:38.200
No, I'm actually kind of curious.

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:40.200
Is it going to be like Final Fuck X?

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:41.200
I hope.

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:43.200
I hope it's not all blurred out and shit.

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:46.200
Will there be pantsless rage?

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:48.200
It'll be just like Final Fuck X.

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:51.200
Where did my afghan go?

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:53.200
That's why I'm curious.

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:54.200
It's like disappeared.

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:55.200
Oh, there it is.

01:11:55.200 --> 01:12:00.380
It ran away from all the people!

01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:07.700
By the way, I like these chairs because I can sit really sideways in them.

01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:12.620
OK, we're gonna take a quick break, and we're gonna come back and do the cage match in a

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:13.620
little bit.

01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:20.220
But first we're gonna hear some Kylie from the Euromega mix, and then we'll hear something

01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:23.280
from Poppin' Music.

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:29.280
And last message, because Jamie wants to hear it, so we'll be right back boys and girls, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:57.280
Thought that I was going crazy

01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:01.280
Just after one of those days, yeah

01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:04.280
Didn't know what to do

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:08.280
Then there was you again

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:11.280
And everything went so wrong tonight

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:15.280
And the stars, they must get out this time

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:19.280
The music they were playing really blew my mind

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:38.280
Cause baby, when I heard you were in love first I knew you were meant to be in love

01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:10.280
If you miss that beat

01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:12.280
The king and the chef go marching

01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:16.280
It's time to say goodbye to my fate

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.280
I want you to know

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:22.280
I'm ready to be happy

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:23.280
It's my time

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:25.280
I need to face that

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.280
Bad things for you

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:30.280
You don't have to let me get to see

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:31.280
I don't need you

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:34.280
Bad things for you

01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:35.280
I can take you somewhere

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:37.280
I don't need you anymore

01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:46.280
I'm running out of time, wait, where are you?

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:56.280
I don't know what I'm feeling

01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:59.280
But I can feel it inside

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:02.280
I don't know what to say

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:05.280
But I can feel it inside

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:09.280
I'm not living in reality

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:11.280
I'm a loser

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:14.280
Most of all, I've made up my mind

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:16.280
For this part of my life

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:18.280
To say that

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:20.280
That's it for you

01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:22.280
You don't have to love me

01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:24.280
Can't you see you're going to love me

01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:26.280
That's it for you

01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:28.280
I can't let you go

01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:30.280
I don't want you anymore

01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:32.280
That's it for you

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:37.280
You, you don't have to love me, can't you see I'm going to love you

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:41.280
I said, for you, I can make you go where I go

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:43.280
Anymore

01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:34.280
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:59.680
your pick is pretty, well we'll see, you'll see what the songs are going to be in a little

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:01.680
bit.

01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:03.500
But they're all pretty good.

01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:05.740
I know which songs I've heard all these songs, they're all pretty good.

01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:08.420
They're all the kind of music that our chat room seems to like, so those of you that yell

01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:11.460
at us for peaking crap have nothing to complain about this week.

01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:16.260
They said it picks show tunes.

01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:18.460
Masquerade, Paper Faces, I'm very...

01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:22.320
Anyway, I thought I'd open the floor up for story time, because I know a lot of people

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:23.940
had stories they wanted to tell tonight.

01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:29.460
So Jamie, you want to kick it off, why don't you tell us about how you've been burninating

01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:30.460
this weekend with Maren.

01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:31.460
Oh God, where's Maren?

01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:37.460
It starts off with me at work at 5.30 in the morning.

01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:38.460
I work all day.

01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:39.460
Do you want storytime music?

01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:40.460
Sure.

01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:41.460
Isao-kun.

01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:50.460
Oh, yeah, I have to play the music that came to us from the Hamster Alliance because Loki

01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:51.460
liked it.

01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:52.460
I don't remember which one it is.

01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:53.460
I think it's this one.

01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:54.460
Okay.

01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:55.460
Rob, do you have any cookies?

01:19:55.460 --> 01:19:56.460
Do I have what?

01:19:56.460 --> 01:20:15.420
I get off work and I go right over to Jessica's house and there's somebody waiting for me

01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:18.940
there sitting on the couch which is still set up theater style seating for watching

01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:27.180
movies on the wall so we went and what do we do we went out to the south sack

01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:33.020
for boba then we went to roseville for sushi then we went back to my house and

01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:39.280
decided to watch battle royale I got no I got my battle royale manga first

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:45.700
because we went to em a1 comics and then we watched battle royale and your

01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:54.400
I think it would have been better if Dan wasn't doing, you know, director's commentary

01:20:54.400 --> 01:21:04.180
during the last half of it, but it was pretty interesting.

01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:05.180
Moving on.

01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:07.460
Um, paper plate, okay?

01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:13.540
This joke ends right now, okay?

01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:30.060
The plate has been retired. I have a new weapon. It's called the smell of pussy. Or squid.

01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:31.140
Janae, put your pants on.

01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:42.580
We ended up crashing out.

01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:51.120
I woke up at the ass crack of dawn, like 8.30 in the morning, and you were still asleep.

01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:53.580
I went back to bed.

01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:57.380
Got up around 9.30, we bummed around, and then tried to get out of the door, but I kept

01:21:57.380 --> 01:21:59.280
forgetting stuff.

01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:07.240
We finally get in Julie's car that smells like granny panties, the smell of dust and

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:09.240
rotten milk.

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:17.720
We had a really nice drive going into San Francisco and then I got lost because I forgot

01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:20.160
to turn on Van Ness.

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:27.760
Through some direction and just some random turning, we make it to Gary and get there.

01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:35.760
Go shopping, have good food, um, I almost bought Sara's mask, but decided against it.

01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:43.760
And then we, um, we managed to get to a, to a network video with no problem, except for the guy behind me who wanted to kill me.

01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:47.760
This guy had this big vehicle, I swear he was like the worst driver in the world.

01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:59.380
But anyway, so the next thing, we get on the 101 South again to go to network.

01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:01.420
And it turns out he gave us directions to Sunnyvale

01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:03.900
because we were trying to get to Milpitas instead.

01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:09.980
So I got directions from Shark's Girl, from my wifey-poo.

01:23:10.620 --> 01:23:14.660
And we managed to get to Milpitas, Scotland, race to lead horses.

01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:17.180
And then we came back and said, hey, we want some boba.

01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:20.180
So we went to Davis, got...

01:23:20.180 --> 01:23:22.180
What the fuck is this music?

01:23:22.180 --> 01:23:24.180
It's story-type music!

01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:27.180
Okay, this music needs to go away.

01:23:27.180 --> 01:23:29.180
It's okay, but it doesn't fit my story.

01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:32.180
Do you want the violins again?

01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:36.180
This is some burninating music.

01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:39.180
Okay.

01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:43.180
And then we got back to my place.

01:23:43.180 --> 01:23:47.180
And we were gonna have pizza, but we sort of just didn't make it.

01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:50.180
We watched, um, we played some Soulcalibur 2.

01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:57.180
And I got my ass handed to me repeatedly every time, um, Maran picked, um, Taki.

01:23:57.180 --> 01:24:01.180
Of course, it turned out that I was, like, super cheap with-

01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:04.180
Who was I super cheap with?

01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:06.180
Uh, well, I was- I'm always cheap-

01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:09.180
No, it was Seungmino when I pulled out Seungmino instead of Kilik.

01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:10.180
I was really cheap.

01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:12.180
And with, um, Eunseung.

01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:17.180
I was, I sucked with Link. Then we watched from Shaman King, but she fell asleep.

01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:21.180
So I was like, WAKE UP! Go upstairs, cause Dan wants the Goucher!

01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:28.180
So, so she goes to sleep and I'm playing Ragnarok until 1.30 in the morning, and then the end.

01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:33.180
And then there's today, where we just like, sat around the house like, most of the morning.

01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:38.180
And then, um, what else happened?

01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:51.180
We went to the mall, went to Fresh Choice, where the stupid man was who smelled funny and stuck on my foot, and then we went to see Rob- not Rob, we went to see Dan at work.

01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:59.180
So I'm here just mumbling in the background. Mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble.

01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:01.900
the orgy plans with more

01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:03.920
and then uh...

01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:05.120
and then

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:06.160
went back to my house

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:06.940
after

01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:07.920
going to

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:12.240
the half of half of filtrid

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:14.520
and then the liberal right now

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:17.740
and then we can be

01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:19.060
and tomorrow we're going to get

01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:21.160
printed mongrel

01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:23.440
as she made a horse and tried work

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:26.680
tells about trying to work

01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:35.320
Chogdor is a man, Chogdor is a horse man, well really he's just a horse, but still he's

01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:37.320
Chogdor.

01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:44.000
That just got a jazz!

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.600
Anybody else have something they want to share for us on Storytime?

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:52.720
I know that they did over there.

01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:55.320
First of all, I have pie.

01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:57.320
You don't have cake pie, you have apple pie.

01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:59.320
But I still have pie.

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:01.320
Whatever.

01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:03.320
Music.

01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:05.320
Get some Chinese music or something.

01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:07.320
I didn't mean that in a bad way, but yeah.

01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:09.320
Just tell your damn story.

01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:11.320
It's the super garden thing.

01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:13.320
I know.

01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:15.320
And I think I pretty much said it.

01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:17.320
Oh, because of the outbreak thing they were playing?

01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:19.320
Well then why did you raise your hand?

01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:21.320
I don't know.

01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:23.320
Never mind.

01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:29.320
I did a very, very obsessive thing last night.

01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:30.320
What's that?

01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:31.320
Friday night.

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:35.140
I watched Battle Royale and read the manga while watching the movie.

01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:36.140
You're sick.

01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:39.140
That's cool, Jamie.

01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:40.140
Yay.

01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:44.000
Does anybody have any interesting Bimani stories or Bimani accomplishments they want to name

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000
for the week?

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
I passed another 2DX on.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Whoo!

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Yay!

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Which one?

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Foundation something.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:58.000
I thought you were going to say shades, dammit!

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:07.140
My only accomplishment this week is the fact that

01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:11.000
there's the remix contest going on over on BomaniStyle

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000
and uh...

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.680
I can't play DWR

01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:16.440
can't play Semenya and talk at the same time

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:30.440
Anyways, there's a competition going on over at BomaniStyle.com. It's a remix contest, and both entries up, the Dark Black Forest, the Midnight Angel mix, and Legend of Trance are over there.

01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:39.440
So, everybody is listening. What you need to go do is you need to go over to BomaniStyle.com. Go to their forums. If you're not a member, sign up. It'll only take a second.

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:43.440
You go down to the very bottom, and you'll see Bomani Cell Remixing Contest Volume 1.

01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:46.440
What you want to do once you're there, is you want to find my entry.

01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:49.440
There'll be a thread that says, Legend of Trance by Loki.

01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:52.440
You go there, and you rate it a 10.

01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:55.440
Go do that right now.

01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:57.440
I'll give you a second.

01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:03.440
Okay. Now that you've done that, I'll win.

01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:06.440
Okay. No, but really, um, go there and listen to all the remixes.

01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:09.560
remixes. There's a lot of them that really suck, but then there's some that are really

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:14.920
good. So, you'll know pretty much by looking at it which ones are pretty good. You've got,

01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:20.420
there's one DJ Demon, I believe, did Max Resurrection. We played that a while back. It's, it's pretty

01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:27.320
good, you know, but I still want to win. And, so go vote ten for mine, because there's just

01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:32.760
not enough people voting on mine, and I need people to go vote ten, just because.

01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:36.220
And don't just vote a ten. Vote everyone else a one. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

01:28:36.220 --> 01:28:42.220
But, um, post in the thread and talk about how, like, beautiful Loki's remixes are and how his remixes make you want to fuck him.

01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:46.220
Just kidding, Nelly.

01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:47.220
She's just like, alright.

01:28:53.220 --> 01:28:54.220
Yeah, you can want.

01:28:56.220 --> 01:28:57.220
It's nice to want.

01:28:57.220 --> 01:28:59.720
But, um, yeah. There's some pretty good ones.

01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:05.360
The one I like though there's a really good paranoia remix in there that's a hip-hop remix of paranoia

01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:10.240
And we'll maybe get to play that later on in the show that's pretty good. There's a ghost one

01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:16.280
That's kind of a piano ambience one. It's pretty good. There's a sodeep one that's a piano ambience one. That's pretty good

01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:20.880
there's a long version like a trancy remix well a

01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:25.780
Longer trance remix of uh sodeep thats. It's alright

01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:44.740
I have a few remixes that I'd name that deserve ones, but I'm not going to name them on the

01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:45.740
air.

01:29:45.740 --> 01:29:52.140
Anyway, let's get on with the cage match, shall we?

01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:58.140
I think our chat room has been kind of a little eager for this and and I am too. I'm moist with anticipation about this, so

01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:05.940
Last week for two weeks ago. I should say in the orange lounge radio cage match. I got you. I got you

01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:10.980
No you already you already had your one

01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:15.840
Loki won with something that's kind of popular

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:21.720
He won with a pop culture buzz thing because it's the big thing right now, and he wrote. What are you laughing about?

01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:26.080
Something in the chat room DJ Tyron fucks Loki

01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:31.320
Anyway as I was saying

01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:33.560
Last week in the cage match

01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:39.680
Loki's pick one with this oh by the way the way the cage match works all the hosts the three of us myself Loki dark

01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:43.520
Sakura we all pick one song and they all fight each other per your votes

01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:51.520
So you vote for the song you like best, and you send those votes over to Sky in the chat room, but you can't vote until all three songs have played.

01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:56.520
And then the song with the most votes goes into rotation on Orange Lounge Radio until the next cage match.

01:30:56.520 --> 01:31:05.520
So, here was last week's winner and the first song you can vote for tonight is Don Davis and Juno Reactor with Mona Lisa Overdrive from the movie The Matrix Reloaded. Enjoy!

01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:38.920
The first song you can vote for this week is Mona Lisa Overdrive, here in the Cajun

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:39.920
Match.

01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:45.840
It's a very good scene in that movie, by the way, that was from the freeway chase scene.

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:49.600
Second song is going to be Dark Sakura's pick, so why don't you tell us all about it?

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:53.880
I don't even know if it's named right, it says it's from Final Fantasy X, but I don't

01:32:53.880 --> 01:32:54.880
think so.

01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:56.880
Some cool song, I don't even remember the name of it.

01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:29.580
And you only heard a clip of the last song because it won last time, so you only get to hear a clip.

01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:34.580
You get to hear the full one of this. So this is pick number two for this week. Set me free. Enjoy.

01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:01.580
Oh

01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:05.580
That was Set Me Free, which may or may not be Final Fantasy and may or may not be Paul Oakenfold, so go figure.

01:37:05.580 --> 01:37:08.580
Anybody want to comment on that and give it something on a scale of 1 to 10?

01:37:08.580 --> 01:37:09.580
Jamie?

01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:11.580
10.

01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:13.580
Loki, do you have anything you want to say about it?

01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:18.580
It definitely wasn't Oakenfold. It could have been a lot better than that.

01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:23.580
It was all right. I couldn't place it anywhere in Final Fantasy at all.

01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:30.580
It was just kind of average to me. I've heard a lot of trance, second tracks. It was just average. So I'd give it a 7.

01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:36.580
Yeah, I mean it's very trance in the fact that I see it as kind of like background music, but it's nothing I'd kind of be all,

01:37:36.580 --> 01:37:40.580
Ooh, I gotta listen to this song, oh my god, I love this song. But like, you know, if it was planned, I'd be all,

01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:45.580
Okay, yeah, I just kind of, you know, bob my head like the Roxbury guys. So, you know, I'd give it a 7.5. Cool.

01:37:45.580 --> 01:37:49.580
Anybody else want to comment on Set Me Free?

01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:56.580
I like it. It would probably make good background music to start from the net or something.

01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:57.580
Seven and a half.

01:37:57.580 --> 01:37:58.580
Seven and a half.

01:37:58.580 --> 01:38:00.580
Anybody over here in this corner want to comment on Set Me Free?

01:38:00.580 --> 01:38:01.580
Anybody? Anybody? Anybody?

01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:02.580
It was okay, but...

01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:03.580
Is it?

01:38:03.580 --> 01:38:04.580
Yeah.

01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:05.580
Um...

01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:06.580
Do you want me to rate it?

01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:07.580
Yeah.

01:38:07.580 --> 01:38:08.580
Um...

01:38:08.580 --> 01:38:09.580
No?

01:38:09.580 --> 01:38:11.580
Okay, I won't.

01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:12.580
You have to rate it.

01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:13.580
Ugh!

01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:15.580
I've been denied or something.

01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:16.580
Okay, um...

01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:17.580
Seven.

01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:18.580
Alright.

01:38:18.580 --> 01:38:20.580
Alright, so, any, oh, Magus?

01:38:20.580 --> 01:38:25.580
Very transient, really good, like, working music if you're, like, working on some, like,

01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:28.580
platform or anything like that. I'd probably give it an 8.

01:38:28.580 --> 01:38:29.580
It's good burninating music.

01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:32.580
Yeah, oh, hacking or burninating, yeah, there we go.

01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:35.580
That's good music for decorating cakes, too.

01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:38.580
Yeah, I like that.

01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:42.580
Some, some cake decorating music, I like that.

01:38:42.580 --> 01:38:43.580
I like driving to it.

01:38:43.580 --> 01:38:46.580
Okay, any of, any other comments on Set Me Free?

01:38:46.580 --> 01:38:49.580
Anybody, anybody. You could be influencing the votes.

01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:51.580
Oh, oh, we have a hand.

01:38:51.580 --> 01:38:55.580
Good music to refurbish cabinets, too.

01:38:55.580 --> 01:38:57.580
Okay.

01:38:57.580 --> 01:38:59.580
Alright, moving on.

01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:03.580
The third and final song in tonight's cage match is my pick.

01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:09.580
And I decided to go the slutty route, and I picked a former porno star.

01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:11.580
I picked Tracy Lords.

01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:12.580
Did I call it or did I?

01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:18.480
And this this song is kind of a couple years old and a lot of people know the songs from the Mortal Kombat soundtrack

01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:21.720
It's called control, but this is the version that has the vocals in it

01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:27.120
So you could be really slutty so everybody get naked because this is the song to have some sex to

01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:32.120
This is my pick for this week's cage match. It's Tracy Lawrence with control.

01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:36.120
You're such a lonely, you're such a blue You're like your lover, let me control you

01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:39.120
Can't surrender, you'll feel no pain

01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:43.120
Cause I'm the master at this game

01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:00.120
Let me kill you, and make you better

01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:04.120
At this life, you will forget her

01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:07.120
Let me get it and make it better

01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:10.120
I'll be right here if you will forget

01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:12.120
Oh no no no

01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:14.120

01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:15.120

01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:17.120
Let me control it

01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:19.120

01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:24.120
Let me control it

01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:27.120
Come with me to the other side

01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:31.120
Come with me, I need to die

01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:34.120
Go with me to the other side

01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:37.120
Go with me in the tide

01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:55.120
Let me kiss it, I think you can make it better

01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:58.120
I think tonight, you're up again

01:41:58.120 --> 01:41:59.320

01:41:59.320 --> 01:41:59.820

01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:03.620
Out of the lights

01:42:03.620 --> 01:42:04.820
You're up for Kenner

01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:06.120

01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:07.220

01:42:09.820 --> 01:42:10.520
Out of the lights

01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:11.720
You're up for Kenner

01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:12.820
Up for Kenner

01:42:12.820 --> 01:42:13.920
Kiss me lucky tooth

01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:15.120
And lucky sada

01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:16.120

01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:17.420
Out of the lights

01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:18.520
You're up for Kenner

01:42:48.520 --> 01:43:03.520
Let me control it, control, let me control it

01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:08.520
Tracy Lourdes with Control.

01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:13.520
It's cool, but I've had that version for a long time myself, so for me it's kind of old.

01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:18.520
It still doesn't mean it's less of a good song, I'd give it a 7.5.

01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:41.520
I love that song because it brings you back to Q's are days, where we used to play with the Mortal Kombat soundtrack all the time, and that movie, while being a really sucky movie overall, it was good at its time. I like that song even more.

01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:43.520
Dark Tetsuya

01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:23.520
I would agree with Nico Adachi in the chatroom who says it sounds like techno stripper music. Amen. Total stripper music. Yes, another comment?

01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:29.520
That would be my cage dance music. Seriously, I love that. I'd give it a 10.

01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:31.520
So how appropriate for the cage match.

01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:34.520
That was really bad.

01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:36.520
Yeah, I know. That joke gets a 2.

01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:40.520
Anyway, anybody else? Any other comments on Tracy Boyer's control?

01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:42.520
Yeah, mine is too.

01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:44.520
What? Wait, what?

01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:46.520
I like her pornography better than our music.

01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:51.520
I had a really funny one though. It was like, I think, her first album that she did.

01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:56.520
Just about like this girl who would like to introduce these guys and then like kick your ass.

01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:01.520
I have to find that CD again.

01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:08.520

01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:08.180

01:46:08.180 --> 01:46:10.840
everybody wake up cage match is over

01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:15.060
cage match is usually a part of a show where people in the studio fall asleep

01:46:15.060 --> 01:46:18.220
i kinda have to pee but i don't want to pee because we just played a bunch of music

01:46:18.220 --> 01:46:20.180

01:48:53.880 --> 01:49:00.520
how to beat mix kind of an important part of the mix show no I seriously need

01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:05.520
practice. I haven't practiced at all, period. You know, drama and stuff has prevented me

01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:07.520
from doing so, so yeah.

01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:14.520
Okay, um, any other, anybody else going to start a show on Orange Lounge?

01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:16.520
Maybe I should start doing a Friday show.

01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:17.520
You what?

01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:18.520
Maybe I should start doing a Friday show.

01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:23.520
I know, I've, uh, I think I'm going to start, I've, I've, I've tossed the idea around.

01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:26.520
It's really inconvenient for me to do one during the week, but Fridays I could do a

01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:27.520
show.

01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:33.520
Don't also tie yourself down, because what you can do is you can pre-tape like four in a row and then play them later.

01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:34.520
Why would I do that?

01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:35.520
If you want.

01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:37.520
That sort of defeats the purpose of me doing a live show.

01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:40.520
Well, I mean, it's up to you. If you want to do a live show, do it. But, you know, just saying.

01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:46.520
I'm thinking about doing a tape show about remixes and originals. Maybe. I'm kind of toying with that idea.

01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:48.520
Well, mine's all random crap anyway.

01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:49.520
Yours is going to be all random? That's cool.

01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:56.520
I think maybe this Friday I might do another... If I can get the samples, I need to do another video game trivia.

01:49:56.520 --> 01:50:01.960
you should call it to burn innate ha ha ha no I think the burn innate joke we

01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:06.560
don't want we don't want to run around dating the burn innate jokes yes start

01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:09.560
it so yeah you don't have to raise your hand you're not in school well he has to

01:50:09.560 --> 01:50:13.360
get a mic though we need to get a third mic yeah we need to get espo back into

01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:19.560
the chat room so I can get my title back from him good point get it while he's

01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:22.160
not there yeah that's right you got to get it back when he's not there kick him

01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:41.800
I'll tell you guys off-air what that cap is, but the rest of the people don't even know

01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:15.440
So, we hope you're listening to Orange Launch Radio all day long because, you know, we play

01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:16.440
good music.

01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:17.440
Dammit.

01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:18.440
Huh?

01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:25.640
Okay, so, we're going to go to break now so I can pee and tally the votes for CAGEMATCH.

01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:28.800
Maggish, your vote doesn't count because you're here.

01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:29.800
Sorry.

01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:33.000
I just see your name in red and I already know.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Sorry.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Jamie, any requests for this break?

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:41.640
Let's go with Little Red Corvette.

01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:42.640
You want to hear little reg?

01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:44.360
What does little reg corvette have to do with the money?

01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:45.360
I don't care.

01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:46.360
It's plants.

01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:47.360
You're...

01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:48.360
Okay.

01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:52.800
No, I'm not reading that.

01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:55.960
Why don't we go with some keyboard mania stuff?

01:51:55.960 --> 01:51:56.960
Okay, some keyboard mania.

01:51:56.960 --> 01:51:58.960
Let's go with least 100 seconds.

01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:00.280
Okay, I can do that.

01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:02.920

I mean the back of your mind I smile

01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:41.200
But I am not so blind

Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:07.020
Alright, we're back.

01:59:07.020 --> 01:59:12.840
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and we have the winner of this week's cage match,

01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:14.180

and this is a very very close vote you guys

01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:20.320
the winning song only had one vote more

01:59:20.320 --> 01:59:22.400
than the other two songs

01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:25.740
so like the other two songs were tied in the winning one only had one more

01:59:25.740 --> 01:59:26.740
vote than them

01:59:26.740 --> 01:59:29.740
so here it is your winning song

01:59:29.740 --> 01:59:36.740

01:59:37.420 --> 01:59:39.320
oh wait I'm sorry what did you say?

01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:44.440
I say, of course, it's riding off the frickin' boom 6S and Jive or whatever, no, Pipe of

01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:45.440
the Matrix, so...

01:59:45.440 --> 01:59:46.440
What do you expect?

01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:47.440
I mean...

01:59:47.440 --> 01:59:48.440
What are you talkin', Jive?

01:59:48.440 --> 01:59:52.440
Alright, Jive, I don't know, I guess it's because of Genaise.

01:59:52.440 --> 01:59:53.440
Genaise?

01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:54.440
Genaise?

01:59:54.440 --> 01:59:55.440
Yes?

01:59:55.440 --> 01:59:57.440
I hear hissing.

01:59:57.440 --> 02:00:04.680
Anyway, uh, so there you go.

02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:08.360
Um, so, what now?

02:00:08.360 --> 02:00:11.100

02:00:11.100 --> 02:00:13.420

02:01:10.180 --> 02:01:12.180
Here.

02:01:12.180 --> 02:01:16.180
This is fucked up.

02:01:16.180 --> 02:01:22.180
While you're waiting for him to do this stuff, go to ragnarokonline.com and download that game.

02:01:22.180 --> 02:01:26.180
You don't want to do it now because they'll interrupt their stream for Orange Lost Radio.

02:01:26.180 --> 02:01:28.180
We already just heard like a ton of music.

02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:30.180
Doesn't everybody have like a T1 connection? Come on.

02:01:30.180 --> 02:01:34.180

Royale would say, one down, 13 to go.

02:01:56.900 --> 02:01:58.980
I don't want any more freaking drinks.

02:01:58.980 --> 02:02:00.580
All right.

02:02:00.580 --> 02:02:06.780
So Maren, tell us about this book, this little manga

02:02:06.780 --> 02:02:12.500
you're reading, the first volume of the English edition

02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:14.340
of Battle Royale.

02:02:14.340 --> 02:02:17.500
And Jamie handed it to me, so I am looking at it.

02:02:17.500 --> 02:02:20.100
And hi, Smosh, because I know your name.

02:02:20.100 --> 02:02:22.460
And the art is kind of interesting.

02:02:22.460 --> 02:02:27.460
and there's a squirrel-faced guy in here that I really want to die, and hopefully he will

02:02:27.460 --> 02:02:28.460
die soon.

02:02:28.460 --> 02:02:29.460
That's about it.

02:02:29.460 --> 02:02:32.460
Don't you think the battle royale thing is getting old?

02:02:32.460 --> 02:02:35.460
Well, I had never seen battle royale until yesterday, so...

02:02:35.460 --> 02:02:36.460
Oh, okay.

02:02:36.460 --> 02:02:37.460
So it's still new for you.

02:02:37.460 --> 02:02:38.460
I'm just teasing.

02:02:38.460 --> 02:02:39.460
I'm just giving Jabin a hard time.

02:02:39.460 --> 02:02:40.460
Oh, okay.

02:02:40.460 --> 02:02:43.580
I get a long mic.

02:02:43.580 --> 02:02:46.820
I'll come over here to the cuddling folks.

02:02:46.820 --> 02:02:50.740
And since they wanted me to talk about marriage this episode and the people that are going

02:02:50.740 --> 02:02:53.620
get married on this episode?

02:02:53.620 --> 02:02:56.800
I'm just kidding.

02:02:56.800 --> 02:03:01.920
Are you enjoying each other's company?

02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:04.700
Yea.

02:03:04.700 --> 02:03:06.980
It's cute.

02:03:06.980 --> 02:03:10.780
Speaking of which we did play those two in Scandia yesterday.

02:03:10.780 --> 02:03:14.280
How much time did you guys collectively spend at Scandia this weekend?

02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:18.280
Let's see, wait. Friday and Saturday.

02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:22.280
So yeah, probably, you know.

02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:26.280
Any annoying scandia people stories you want to tell?

02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:30.280
Kids running across the DDR machine while you're trying to play.

02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:34.280
On stage, I mean.

02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:38.280
We have a picture of it. We had this three year old up on the extreme

02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:42.280
just jumping around on stage

02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:47.320
H2, Rhythm and Police, Light. It was hilarious. We have two pictures that will be up on the

02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:48.320
album.

02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:55.320
You don't bring anything up, Rob.

02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:19.940
set up

02:04:19.940 --> 02:04:23.000
all i got to make a minute to keep me company this is nice anyway

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:26.060
i want to talk about uh... this kind of like controversy at the three or

02:04:26.060 --> 02:04:27.600
whatever you want to call it okay

02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:30.600
eight folks terms i think it's a poster so from seattle came down which i think

02:04:30.600 --> 02:04:33.600
is really cool like travel really far for a term in and i met

02:04:33.600 --> 02:04:36.300
i met like one or two of them they were very nice and that uh...

02:04:36.300 --> 02:04:37.760
this uh...

02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:38.720
girl goes by

02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:41.600
d r four b online i think i hope it makes up the letters

02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:45.240
she's very cool really close to work at least things are shoes which is awesome

02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:50.040
But Seattle was kind of getting, I guess, knocked or jabbed at or poked fun at or whatever

02:04:50.040 --> 02:04:52.280
for being big old bar-rapers.

02:04:52.280 --> 02:04:56.260
Like they hold onto the bar when they play their songs, which kind of creates a little

02:04:56.260 --> 02:04:57.260
bit of controversy.

02:04:57.260 --> 02:05:00.380
Is that real P.A. or whatever, you know, is it real?

02:05:00.380 --> 02:05:04.880
And to them, looking at us, like, the way they're kind of looking at, or I should say,

02:05:04.880 --> 02:05:08.000
when I say us, I mean California, the way Seattle was kind of looking at California

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:09.880
was kind of like, what's a big fucking deal?

02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:10.880
You know?

02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:12.920
It's that the bars are there, so why not use them?

02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:13.920
So what do you guys think?

02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:17.920
I'm curious of people's opinions in here on bar raping, quote-unquote.

02:05:17.920 --> 02:05:30.920
Um, I really don't give a shit, because I saw a guy AAA Max 300. Yes, he was raping the bar, but I'd like to see anybody else try that.

02:05:30.920 --> 02:05:33.920
It doesn't really matter.

02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:44.920
Exactly, we do have a bleeder, okay? Anyway, I mean, think about it. He doesn't want to fall on his ass, he doesn't want to break his leg like, whatever that guy's name was.

02:05:44.920 --> 02:05:50.920
So, at least he's not freestyling and holding onto the bar, that's different, but PA-ing, whatever you can do.

02:05:50.920 --> 02:06:01.920
The only thing I didn't like, and it had nothing to do with bar raping, was the constant spraying down of Windex on the thing to rub down the pads to make sure they were absolutely clear and free of dust.

02:06:31.920 --> 02:06:35.920
Where, if I'm going to be putting all my weight in one foot, I won't fucking slip and die.

02:06:35.920 --> 02:06:39.920
If I'm playing singles, whatever, you know, whatever the pads are, fine.

02:06:39.920 --> 02:06:51.920
I don't know if they realize or even notice, but if you wash them, if you use some sort of solution to clean the pads, it makes it slippier, slipperier, slipperier, slipper, whatever.

02:06:51.920 --> 02:06:58.920
ever

02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:25.160
Because if holding on to the bar will make me that much better, I'm going to do it.

02:07:25.160 --> 02:07:28.080
I don't care if there's this stigma like, ooh, you're not supposed to hold on to the

02:07:28.080 --> 02:07:29.080
bar.

02:07:29.080 --> 02:07:30.080
Fuck it.

02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:31.680
If I can get scores that good, I'm going to hold on to the bar.

02:07:31.680 --> 02:07:35.280
Sure enough, I go back, I play Legend of Max, I hold on to the bar this time, I got like

02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:39.560
15 seconds further than I usually do.

02:07:39.560 --> 02:07:40.560
Go figure.

02:07:40.560 --> 02:07:44.880
Yes, thank you, my recent accomplishment.

02:07:44.880 --> 02:07:48.120
I am two-fisting the mics.

02:07:48.120 --> 02:07:49.920
Why did you give me a mic and Rob gave me a mic?

02:07:49.920 --> 02:07:51.920
Okay, I've got both mics.

02:08:19.920 --> 02:08:27.100
Okay, new topic, alright, we're gonna go with like, you know, this year and pretty much

02:08:27.100 --> 02:08:28.100
last year.

02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:33.480
This year I've noticed a lot of trends changing, you know, this is just like pop culture trends.

02:08:33.480 --> 02:08:40.640
Example, you know, before I used to make all these AIDS jokes, like, you're gonna get AIDS.

02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:46.360
SARS is the AIDS of 2003.

02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:48.600
SARS is not a joke.

02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:54.340
We laughed so hard just over making SARS jokes during the whole trip.

02:08:54.340 --> 02:08:57.460
It was great.

02:08:57.460 --> 02:08:59.660
Is there any other pop culture changes you want to address?

02:08:59.660 --> 02:09:02.300
There was another one, but I can't remember it right now.

02:09:02.300 --> 02:09:03.980
When you think of it, you bring it up, okay?

02:09:03.980 --> 02:09:04.980
Okay.

02:09:04.980 --> 02:09:05.980
In the meantime, Janae, how's the story?

02:09:05.980 --> 02:09:10.980
Okay, I have this really weird story to tell, because just thinking of SARS, it's just when

02:09:10.980 --> 02:09:11.980
you think of something.

02:09:11.980 --> 02:09:16.980
I went to the mall the other day and I went to the store, and as soon as I walked in the

02:09:16.980 --> 02:09:20.800
coughing really bad I was like oh my god what's going on I thought it was like

02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:24.620
anthrax attack and walking through the store walking through everybody's

02:09:24.620 --> 02:09:28.500
coughing. Anthrax was last year. Well anthrax was the year before last so

02:09:28.500 --> 02:09:33.700
anyways but still I was like what the hell's going on come to find out this

02:09:33.700 --> 02:09:37.700
kid that says cash register pepper sprayed his boss on accident because he

02:09:37.700 --> 02:09:41.120
didn't know that the thing was full and he was messing around with it and it

02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:45.700
infected the whole store with pepper spray so that was really interesting to

02:09:45.700 --> 02:09:49.180

02:09:49.180 --> 02:09:54.880

How do I introduce myself to your listeners?

02:10:25.460 --> 02:10:29.700
Tell them your online name and give them a quick personal ad because we know you're available.

02:10:29.700 --> 02:10:32.900
I don't know how true that is.

02:10:32.900 --> 02:10:34.300
Okay, my name is Janae.

02:10:34.300 --> 02:10:37.740
On the board, I'm pixie dust and I'm 20.

02:10:37.740 --> 02:10:39.940
I'm too damn old is what I think.

02:10:39.940 --> 02:10:45.500
I'm just looking at a picture of me holding up a McDonald's apple pie, so yeah, I'm sexy, okay?

02:10:47.500 --> 02:10:49.060
Apple pie going straight to my thigh.

02:10:49.180 --> 02:10:53.800

02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:01.700
I got a lip on me.

02:11:01.700 --> 02:11:03.580
You had a quick thought, Lucky, before we get to Mad Lib?

02:11:04.180 --> 02:11:04.600
I did.

02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:05.740
Okay, you look like it.

02:11:05.740 --> 02:11:10.740
Okay, Jamie, are we ready for Bomani Madlib?

02:11:10.740 --> 02:11:11.740

02:11:11.740 --> 02:11:12.740
Oh yeah, I remember now.

02:11:12.740 --> 02:11:13.740
What?

02:11:13.740 --> 02:11:18.180
My friend was on TV because he was the only UC student to stay over in China during the

02:11:18.180 --> 02:11:21.140
whole SARS thing while everyone else came home.

02:11:21.140 --> 02:11:22.140
His name was Eric Fong.

02:11:22.140 --> 02:11:27.860
If you're in the Sacramento area and you happened to be watching News 3 at 11 a couple days

02:11:27.860 --> 02:11:29.420
ago, you probably saw him.

02:11:29.420 --> 02:11:30.840
His name is Eric Fong.

02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:33.740
He used to make fun of me all the time, but we were really good friends.

02:11:33.740 --> 02:11:35.340
Aw, it's so precious.

02:11:35.340 --> 02:11:38.860
Anyway, let's get to our Bemani mad lib.

02:11:38.860 --> 02:11:40.420
How's this going to work, Jamie?

02:11:40.420 --> 02:11:41.360

Okay. And you suggest it and you go around the room, everyone's suggesting one.

02:11:52.680 --> 02:11:57.020
Okay. One by one and then we'll read you the story and, by the way, this particular one,

02:11:57.440 --> 02:12:00.640
I might even give you the title or anything of what it is, but you get to find

02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:03.640
out what it is you're butchering after you put in the words.

02:12:03.640 --> 02:12:06.420
So should they be Bhumani related words?

02:12:06.420 --> 02:12:07.680
No, not necessarily.

02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:09.520
Okay. Be creative.

02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:13.720
Be creative. Okay. But I'm not even going to say that much. Here you go.

02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:18.540
So let's let, um, why don't you go first?

02:12:18.540 --> 02:12:22.680
Wait, you better hold on to a mic, Jamie, and we'll pass around the other one.

02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:27.280
What do you want me to do? Hold the mic in my cleavage?

02:12:27.280 --> 02:12:28.540
It's there.

02:12:28.540 --> 02:12:31.200

02:21:37.600 --> 02:21:43.960
Okay, this sounds voluptuous, it is simple.

02:21:43.960 --> 02:21:51.960
It may also sound gluttonous or odd, as the twin around here likes to put it.

02:21:51.960 --> 02:21:54.860
Twatterific.

02:21:54.860 --> 02:21:58.220
You can jizz that last one for yourself.

02:21:58.220 --> 02:22:07.260
I guess, but from my DDR Extreme, the game, it is also a dirty amount of ottoman, and

02:22:07.260 --> 02:22:12.380
there are a few million people out there who assfuck the many Black Rapinoe versions of

02:22:12.380 --> 02:22:16.780
a poll to back me up.

02:22:16.780 --> 02:22:22.800
Many frozen extra cream cheese are crapfully included to combust the basic gameplay concept.

02:22:22.800 --> 02:22:32.920
The Hulky version has a full complement up to the import 59th mix, meaning metallic training,

02:22:32.920 --> 02:22:39.780
free play, and the diet shit, where the other extras, oh, where the game shit the calories

02:22:39.780 --> 02:22:48.600
you burn by burninating, but not the solo mode and the other extras that arrowed with

02:22:48.600 --> 02:22:58.820
recently released number mix, released 4900 mix, whatever, okay, there's no cosplaying

02:22:58.820 --> 02:23:05.140
that I can sodomize though, no homosexual chainsaw like the sexual centipede and such.

02:23:05.140 --> 02:23:10.940
So, and how was that for our first big year of Mad Lib?

02:23:10.940 --> 02:23:11.940
Beautiful.

02:23:11.940 --> 02:23:12.940
I think, you know what?

02:23:12.940 --> 02:23:16.140
I think the chat room fell asleep for the first half of that, but that was a good payoff

02:23:16.140 --> 02:23:20.740
at the end, so it was worth it that you burninated.

02:23:20.740 --> 02:23:24.180
Maybe we should, maybe we should like make one in advance and have the chat room vote

02:23:24.180 --> 02:23:30.660
on words or send them by email and then we put it in to read during the show later.

02:23:30.660 --> 02:23:32.300
We'll tweak that one.

02:23:32.300 --> 02:23:34.540
Well, that was fun.

02:23:34.540 --> 02:23:36.860
Yeah, I like that.

02:23:36.860 --> 02:23:39.260
Shit the calories you've burned by burninating.

02:23:39.260 --> 02:23:41.260
Oh, boy.

02:23:41.260 --> 02:23:50.820
Hey, Irene, the chat room wants to see another Orange Crush segment.

02:23:50.820 --> 02:23:53.260
When do we get to see one of those?

02:23:53.260 --> 02:23:55.980
I could probably come up with one by the end of the night.

02:23:55.980 --> 02:23:56.980
By the end of the night tonight?

02:23:56.980 --> 02:23:58.340
Yeah, what time is it now?

02:23:58.340 --> 02:23:59.820
You got 30 minutes?

02:23:59.820 --> 02:24:02.100
Okay, I could probably get it in like 10 minutes.

02:24:02.100 --> 02:24:05.080
Okay, what we'll do, we're going to go to a quick break and then we'll come back and

02:24:05.080 --> 02:24:06.740
how about we do some Ask Orange Lounge?

02:24:06.740 --> 02:24:07.740
Yeah, that's fine.

02:24:07.740 --> 02:24:08.740
Does that sound fine?

02:24:08.740 --> 02:24:09.740
Okay.

02:24:09.740 --> 02:24:10.740
Orange Crush now.

02:24:10.740 --> 02:24:15.100
Okay, so we're going to take a quick break and we're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:24:15.100 --> 02:24:16.100
Okay.

02:24:16.100 --> 02:24:23.260
Have a big light, mate.

02:24:23.260 --> 02:24:26.740
Okay, so Loki's going to queue up something.

02:24:26.740 --> 02:24:31.760
You can send in questions now for Ask Orange Lounge because we're going to do that when

02:24:31.760 --> 02:24:34.920
we come back and then we're gonna move on to orange crush by the end of the

02:24:34.920 --> 02:24:45.880

I think you guys will like it.

02:29:27.640 --> 02:29:36.560
Okay, now we're also going to play something.

02:29:36.560 --> 02:29:39.520
Loki, you want to introduce this, which you just told me to play?

02:29:39.520 --> 02:29:44.800
Yeah, this is, I don't know if anyone, anyone who hasn't caught the fuck off shows we've

02:29:44.800 --> 02:29:50.160

02:29:50.160 --> 02:29:51.160
Reloaded.

02:29:51.160 --> 02:29:52.960
And you want to talk about the fusion here?

02:29:52.960 --> 02:29:58.440
Yeah, it's Gravity in a mix with a song off of the Matrix Reloaded soundtrack called Dread

02:29:58.440 --> 02:30:00.720
Rock by Pollock and Fould.

02:30:00.720 --> 02:30:06.320

02:30:06.320 --> 02:30:07.720

So send those questions in and we'll be right back after this brand new Loki remix, Gravity

02:30:11.600 --> 02:30:18.600
reloaded here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:33:11.600 --> 02:33:18.600
Hello? Hello, is this thing on testing? Testing 1-2?

02:33:18.600 --> 02:33:24.600
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

02:33:24.600 --> 02:33:28.600
Hello? I don't understand this. Does this thing work?

02:33:28.600 --> 02:33:29.600
This thing reads like stereo instructions!

02:33:29.600 --> 02:33:30.600
Is this on?

02:33:30.600 --> 02:33:31.600
What the hell?

02:33:31.600 --> 02:33:37.600
Orange Lounge Radio broke down Get Open Monty Radio.

02:33:37.600 --> 02:33:39.600
What the f***?

02:33:39.600 --> 02:33:44.600
Welcome back, everybody. It's time for everybody's favorite part of Orange Lounge.

02:33:44.600 --> 02:33:49.600
It's the part where the chat room really gets to participate. It's Ask Orange Lounge!

02:33:49.600 --> 02:33:53.600
Tonight you can ask Orange Lounge, that would be myself, DarkSakura, or Loki.

02:33:53.600 --> 02:33:57.600
Or you could ask Maren. You could ask Pixie Dust. You could ask...

02:33:57.600 --> 02:34:00.600
Well, Nelly's probably not going to talk to you, but you could try asking her.

02:34:00.600 --> 02:34:07.600
You could ask Brad, Irene. You could ask Navi, but he probably won't talk to you either because he's setting up for Orange Crush.

02:34:07.600 --> 02:34:09.460
Or you could ask DDR Angel and Magus.

02:34:09.460 --> 02:34:11.900
Quite the cute couple over there.

02:34:11.900 --> 02:34:16.420
All right, let's get to the first question, shall we?

02:34:16.420 --> 02:34:20.660
Let's ask your ass, how are you feeling today?

02:34:20.660 --> 02:34:23.560
That had a maturity level of like three.

02:34:23.560 --> 02:34:27.280
All right, first question from DJ Tyrant

02:34:27.280 --> 02:34:30.100
wants to know, when can I come up and be a guest on the show?

02:34:30.100 --> 02:34:31.100
That's my question.

02:34:31.100 --> 02:34:33.900
Well, when can you get in your car and drive?

02:34:33.900 --> 02:34:36.100
Plus, you know, I don't know.

02:34:36.100 --> 02:34:43.100
I feel weird about having strangers in the house. I mean, of course, it worked before because I didn't know Angel before she came up here to be on the show, so...

02:34:43.100 --> 02:34:49.100
Tyrant's not the only one that said he wants to be on the show, though. Here's my recommendation to you. Come to a tournament...

02:34:49.100 --> 02:34:55.100
Come to a tournament like, you know, we'll be... I'm sure at least one of the three of us will be at Cyber Beat Nation 2.

02:34:55.100 --> 02:34:59.100
Or come, you know, come to us at a tournament, get to know us there, come be on a team...

02:34:59.100 --> 02:35:00.100
Or just come.

02:35:00.100 --> 02:35:01.100
Or just come.

02:35:01.100 --> 02:35:05.100
And then, once we get to know you, okay, come on a show.

02:35:05.100 --> 02:35:12.100
Because I can't come to the studio.

02:35:12.100 --> 02:35:15.020
Come to a tournament and get warmed up to the show first, because that's an easy way

02:35:15.020 --> 02:35:16.020
to be on the show.

02:35:16.020 --> 02:35:21.060
You don't have to sit here and be bored in the studio like everyone else.

02:35:21.060 --> 02:35:23.180
Let's get to the next question from Ninst.

02:35:23.180 --> 02:35:27.700
Ninst would like to know, what is the meaning of life, the universe and everything?

02:35:27.700 --> 02:35:28.700
42.

02:35:28.700 --> 02:35:31.820
42 says Mary, 42 says Jamie.

02:35:31.820 --> 02:35:33.540
69 says Skye.

02:35:33.540 --> 02:35:34.540
37.

02:35:34.540 --> 02:35:38.940
Janae might have a serious answer.

02:35:38.940 --> 02:35:45.780
My ass. Your ass. That's wonderful. That's the second person.

02:35:45.780 --> 02:35:50.260
The meaning of life really is 42. The earth was constructed to solve the riddle of the

02:35:50.260 --> 02:35:51.260
meaning of life.

02:35:51.260 --> 02:35:55.300
Unfortunately, it was destroyed before it could finish the computations, so it came up with 42.

02:35:55.300 --> 02:35:58.760
Now the purpose of life is easy.

02:35:58.760 --> 02:36:03.580
The purpose of life is not dying. The purpose of life,

02:36:03.580 --> 02:36:07.180
Breathe in, breathe out. Repeat.

02:36:07.180 --> 02:36:10.660
I have a serious answer to this question. Can you people handle it?

02:36:10.660 --> 02:36:12.340
No.

02:36:12.340 --> 02:36:15.420
Okay, I'm going to try a serious answer to this question.

02:36:15.420 --> 02:36:17.500
The meaning of life

02:36:17.500 --> 02:36:21.300
is to experience every possible emotion possible.

02:36:21.300 --> 02:36:23.020
Aw, da da da.

02:36:23.020 --> 02:36:28.620
That's not an aw, that's like, death can be one of those. I still think the answer is 42.

02:36:28.620 --> 02:36:30.420
It's 42.

02:36:30.420 --> 02:36:34.420
I feel deathly ill. I woke up the other day and I went, ah, I'm deathly ill.

02:36:34.420 --> 02:36:39.420
Alright. That's, that's funny. You know what's funny?

02:36:39.420 --> 02:36:41.420
I'm experiencing vomit from that.

02:36:41.420 --> 02:36:47.420
You know what the meaning of life is? Well, actually, you'll never know because once you figure out the meaning of life, that's when you die.

02:36:47.420 --> 02:36:53.420
See, so if you ever do figure out the meaning of life, you will die. That's why no one has ever figured it out.

02:36:53.420 --> 02:36:54.420
The meaning of-

02:36:54.420 --> 02:36:55.420
Hey, Shady.

02:36:55.420 --> 02:36:57.420
Ah, shit. Dead.

02:36:57.420 --> 02:36:59.420
Alright. Second-

02:37:29.420 --> 02:37:32.620
Wait, what do you do? You just kind of like straddle the dryer?

02:37:32.620 --> 02:37:35.620
Exactly. It's an industrial one, so I straddle the dryer.

02:37:35.620 --> 02:37:38.920
It's Talbe? Does he know?

02:37:38.920 --> 02:37:42.020
That's awful. I hope you get beat for that.

02:37:42.020 --> 02:37:43.820
Alright, moving on.

02:37:43.820 --> 02:37:46.920
Next question from John Fields.

02:37:46.920 --> 02:37:50.320
Just how many people in California have SARS?

02:37:50.320 --> 02:37:53.720
I want to be on the show when I visit California, but if SARS is a problem,

02:37:53.720 --> 02:37:56.620
I may wait for next summer to visit.

02:37:56.620 --> 02:38:00.120
That's gotta be the dumbest question I've ever heard.

02:38:00.120 --> 02:38:04.880
Why is that? Because anyone who's been in America who's gotten SARS

02:38:04.880 --> 02:38:07.820
has gotten treatment for it and are like, better.

02:38:07.820 --> 02:38:10.660
I think it was a joke.

02:38:10.660 --> 02:38:14.540
Just, you know what, we're not Toronto, so get over it.

02:38:14.540 --> 02:38:18.300
Yeah, Toronto's just trying to be special because they're Canadian.

02:38:18.300 --> 02:38:22.180
You know, and they're just like, look at us, we're Chinese.

02:38:22.180 --> 02:38:23.420
Sort of.

02:38:23.420 --> 02:38:25.260
We have SARS.

02:38:25.260 --> 02:38:27.400
for sarsi

02:38:27.400 --> 02:38:29.760
we got stars a alright

02:38:29.760 --> 02:38:31.000
moving on

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:34.940
black lab all excellent excellent question from black lab referring to the

02:38:34.940 --> 02:38:36.740
chat room earlier this week

02:38:36.740 --> 02:38:39.920
okay we have to get an answer from everybody on this

02:38:39.920 --> 02:38:44.900
have you ever been that point where you were just so hungry you are so deathly

02:38:44.900 --> 02:38:49.320
hungry you would just do anything the question from black lab would you give a

02:38:49.320 --> 02:38:51.200
blow job for a pizza

02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:54.860
and i've done that

02:38:54.860 --> 02:38:56.920
notice i don't have to

02:38:56.920 --> 02:39:01.260
i wouldn't give a blowjob for any reason because it's nasty

02:39:01.260 --> 02:39:04.580
i'm sorry but it's the whole concept of putting your mouth where someone pisses

02:39:04.580 --> 02:39:06.220
from uh...

02:39:06.220 --> 02:39:09.540
so i would probably say that what i would do instead is get in my car and go

02:39:09.540 --> 02:39:11.500
buy one

02:39:11.500 --> 02:39:14.780
let's say you don't have any money

02:39:14.780 --> 02:39:19.540
then i would kill someone for pizza but i would never blow them

02:39:19.540 --> 02:39:21.500
uh... anybody else want to comment

02:39:21.500 --> 02:39:24.520
i agree with jamie thank you

02:39:24.520 --> 02:39:28.520
Well, I'd receive one for pizza, then I'd have a blowjob for pizza.

02:39:28.520 --> 02:39:30.520
Excuse me?

02:39:30.520 --> 02:39:33.520

02:39:38.520 --> 02:39:43.520
And Zero put an excellent answer to this question earlier this week, so go read it.

02:39:43.520 --> 02:39:49.520
Let's change this show from Orange Lounge to Dick Haters, because...

02:39:49.520 --> 02:39:51.520
I don't hate...

02:39:51.520 --> 02:39:53.620
uh... uh... we can't

02:39:53.620 --> 02:39:55.600
dictating feminized

02:39:55.600 --> 02:39:57.660
hey really really really

02:39:57.660 --> 02:39:59.540
i don't

02:39:59.540 --> 02:40:02.340
it's not that i hate dick

02:40:02.340 --> 02:40:05.280
it's like i don't think it's particularly appetite let me please let

02:40:05.280 --> 02:40:07.420
me put it this way it's like

02:40:07.420 --> 02:40:11.260
to jamie dick is like a teddy bear you know you can fluff it and play with it

02:40:11.260 --> 02:40:12.540
and how to get squeezed it

02:40:12.540 --> 02:40:14.620
you're not gonna eat it

02:40:14.620 --> 02:40:18.240
you put it in your your couch

02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:25.120
me dick is foreign it is so foreign it's like japan so i don't know where it is it's so foreign

02:40:25.120 --> 02:40:29.440
let's revise this let's revise this what would you do for kondike bar

02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:35.120
but that's chocolate that's different anyway moving on what would you do for oreo kondike

02:40:35.120 --> 02:40:39.440
bar moving on i want to get through i want to get through these ask horse lounge questions

02:40:39.440 --> 02:40:46.960
okay here we go here we go i just heard oh this is from crash override 003 as opposed to 0070s 003

02:40:46.960 --> 02:40:53.960
I just heard that DDR Extreme is the last arcade game for the DDR series, oh that old

02:40:54.240 --> 02:41:01.240
rumor. Is this true? If it is, the last will be complete BS.

02:41:02.200 --> 02:41:05.880
Again, that old rumor.

02:41:05.880 --> 02:41:08.960
You know what, this is my thought, again, there is no definitive answer. If we knew

02:41:08.960 --> 02:41:12.020
the definitive answer, we'd tell you.

02:41:12.020 --> 02:41:14.480
I have the definitive answer.

02:41:14.480 --> 02:41:15.480
Who gives a shit?

02:41:15.480 --> 02:41:16.480
This DDR sucks.

02:41:16.480 --> 02:41:17.480
Shut up.

02:41:17.480 --> 02:41:22.180
No, it's not the last one, the next one will be the last one, and they're going to continue

02:41:22.180 --> 02:41:27.360
it on the console because DDR is not popular in Japan, popular music is.

02:41:27.360 --> 02:41:28.520
Here's my thought on it.

02:41:28.520 --> 02:41:30.720
As far as the USA is concerned, it's true.

02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:33.240
There's probably not going to be any other USA machines.

02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:35.120
It's pretty much a home only thing.

02:41:35.120 --> 02:41:38.340
Japan, nobody really knows, but here's my thought.

02:41:38.340 --> 02:41:41.880
It's probably the last version of DDR in its current form.

02:41:41.880 --> 02:41:46.860
If they do another DDR, it's going to be like DDR or DX type thing.

02:41:46.860 --> 02:41:48.860
That's my honest opinion on it.

02:41:48.860 --> 02:41:51.340
So we can take no motion, I see.

02:41:51.340 --> 02:41:52.340
Hopefully.

02:41:52.340 --> 02:41:53.340
Not.

02:41:53.340 --> 02:41:57.420
Anyway, let's see, also second part of this question, oh!

02:41:57.420 --> 02:41:59.820
And when are they going to fire Naoki and replace him?

02:41:59.820 --> 02:42:02.180
Some of his material is just plain shit now these days.

02:42:02.180 --> 02:42:08.380
Don't you know that they clone Naoki every year and keep using his clones?

02:42:08.380 --> 02:42:09.600
I don't know.

02:42:09.600 --> 02:42:14.740
I do notice that Xtreme kind of had less Naoki tracks than usual, but I don't think.

02:42:14.740 --> 02:42:17.380
He's still doing music for 2DX and all that, so he's still around.

02:42:17.380 --> 02:42:21.540
From what I understand, isn't he also actually working on Gradius 5?

02:42:21.540 --> 02:42:24.300
Yeah, he's got things to do.

02:42:24.300 --> 02:42:25.540
Alright.

02:42:25.540 --> 02:42:30.300
Okay, so I'm going to cut off the question submission now, so I've got four questions

02:42:30.300 --> 02:43:00.020
left to burn through here and then we're going to get to Orange Crush.

02:43:00.020 --> 02:43:07.020
would like to know what would Jesus do for a Klondike bar?

02:43:07.380 --> 02:43:14.380
What would Jesus do for a Klondike bar?

02:43:14.380 --> 02:43:17.380
He'd just, you know, hang around.

02:43:17.380 --> 02:43:24.380
He'd pick up a piece of shit and turn it into a Klondike bar.

02:43:24.380 --> 02:43:28.380
Jesus would blow the pizza man.

02:43:28.380 --> 02:43:30.380
Anyway, okay.

02:43:30.380 --> 02:43:35.380
Last question. Are you guys ready for Orange Crush? Good. Okay.

02:43:35.380 --> 02:43:40.380
Puppy would like to know, do any of you, oh, and I know Jamie knows the answer to this, I'm almost positive.

02:43:40.380 --> 02:43:45.380
Black Lab wants to know, do any of you know where the saying, this DDR sucks, came from?

02:43:45.380 --> 02:43:50.380
It came from Fuzzy Half, from Drakona Staunter.

02:43:50.380 --> 02:43:55.380
She was at a DDR tournament and said, this DDR sucks.

02:43:55.380 --> 02:43:56.380
So there you go.

02:43:56.380 --> 02:43:57.380
Was that at CVGL or was that at-

02:43:57.380 --> 02:43:58.380
It was Lily.

02:43:58.380 --> 02:44:01.380
I know it was Lily that said it, but was that CVGL or was that at the Mountain Mikes one?

02:44:01.380 --> 02:44:02.380
Mountain Mikes.

02:44:02.380 --> 02:44:03.380
I think it was the Mountain Mikes one.

02:44:03.380 --> 02:44:06.380
I thought it was from, what was it, that huge-

02:44:06.380 --> 02:44:07.380
No, it was CVGL.

02:44:07.380 --> 02:44:17.380
I thought it was that huge SoCal tournament or whatever that they were competing for freestyle or whatever and it was for the solo machine.

02:44:17.380 --> 02:44:19.380
That solo sucks anyway.

02:44:19.380 --> 02:44:20.380
That's the other one.

02:44:20.380 --> 02:44:22.380
But yeah, this DDR sucks.

02:44:22.380 --> 02:44:26.380
It was TVGL because we did the Step Squad thing at Mount Likes.

02:44:26.380 --> 02:44:28.380
The promo at Mount Likes.

02:44:28.380 --> 02:44:29.380
Oh okay.

02:44:29.380 --> 02:44:30.380
She didn't go, I went.

02:44:30.380 --> 02:44:33.380
I thought it was the same day that you guys had done that promo, but it was TVGL.

02:44:33.380 --> 02:44:34.380
No, it was before.

02:44:34.380 --> 02:44:36.380
We tried to get her to say it again and she wouldn't.

02:45:06.380 --> 02:45:15.380
Now, it's time for Orange Crush. Now, it's time for Orange Crush.

02:45:15.380 --> 02:45:28.380
Okay, Irene, take it away. Do I need to leave the room then first? Tell them about the topic and stuff, and somebody else needs to time.

02:45:28.380 --> 02:45:52.920

02:49:08.580 --> 02:49:11.700
Because that's in rotation on Orange Line right now.

02:49:11.700 --> 02:49:12.700
Question number two.

02:49:12.700 --> 02:49:15.140
Which Poppin' Music artist is getting the newest artist collection CD?

02:49:15.140 --> 02:49:16.560
Let me think about this one a little longer.

02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:21.440
The pop and music artist getting a collection CD?

02:49:21.440 --> 02:49:25.240
I'm just trying to think of the artist to have a lot of songs in pop and music.

02:49:25.240 --> 02:49:27.240
I would...

02:49:27.240 --> 02:49:28.240
The classic?

02:49:28.240 --> 02:49:29.240
The classical ones?

02:49:29.240 --> 02:49:36.000
It's either going to be A. Desrow, B. Hideo Suwa, or C. Parquettes?

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.920
I would actually say before I say Desrow, I would say Hideo Suwa.

02:49:38.920 --> 02:49:39.920
No it's Parquettes.

02:49:39.920 --> 02:49:40.920
No.

02:49:40.920 --> 02:49:41.920
Haha.

02:49:41.920 --> 02:49:42.920
Okay third...

02:49:42.920 --> 02:49:52.480
3. In PAPA MUSIC 7, the song PLUTONIC LOVE is done by NARD, who is better known by which

02:49:52.480 --> 02:49:53.480
alias?

02:49:53.480 --> 02:50:09.240
4. What are the names of the two star characters in PAPA MUSIC, NIAMI and NIMI?

02:50:09.240 --> 02:50:13.060
I was thinking of the other ones, I was trying to think of that chick from Dimanche that

02:50:13.060 --> 02:50:18.240
looks like a hussy in the second one, yeah I know you, I know, and then I had the image

02:50:18.240 --> 02:50:20.880
of them, oh that's what they're talking about and I had no idea.

02:50:20.880 --> 02:50:24.600
Okay and the fifth question, the vocalist from the Swedish song did which song in 8th

02:50:24.600 --> 02:50:25.600
style?

02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:26.600
Murmur Twins.

02:50:26.600 --> 02:50:30.480
Oh, I should have known because it's like Garrett's favorite 8th style song, or one

02:50:30.480 --> 02:50:31.480
of them.

02:50:31.480 --> 02:50:33.480
One of them, isn't it?

02:50:33.480 --> 02:50:39.080
I love Murmur Twins.

02:50:39.080 --> 02:50:41.920
And that concludes another episode of Orange Crush.

02:50:41.920 --> 02:50:42.920
Thank you very much.

02:50:42.920 --> 02:50:43.920
That was beautiful.

02:50:43.920 --> 02:50:44.920
You're welcome.

02:50:44.920 --> 02:50:45.920
Here you go.

02:50:45.920 --> 02:50:46.920
Good job.

02:50:46.920 --> 02:50:47.920
I hope the chowram enjoyed that.

02:50:47.920 --> 02:50:48.920
Yeah.

02:50:48.920 --> 02:50:49.920
Jamie and I making butts.

02:50:49.920 --> 02:50:51.920
Jamie and I making butts out of ourselves with our lack of pop and music knowledge.

02:50:51.920 --> 02:50:53.760
Because he made the questions.

02:50:53.760 --> 02:50:54.760
I got yummy.

02:50:54.760 --> 02:50:59.440
I like to give mad props to Garrett for his accomplishments.

02:50:59.440 --> 02:51:02.080
You know, I got it because he was in YY Racing and he was like, hey.

02:51:02.080 --> 02:51:03.720
I am so down with Garrett.

02:51:03.720 --> 02:51:06.420
The only reason I knew like any of those or would have known it.

02:51:06.420 --> 02:51:13.420
You know, I'm such good friends with Garrett, and I still didn't know.

02:51:13.420 --> 02:51:22.360
Okay, so, can I get my chair back, please, please, alright.

02:51:22.360 --> 02:51:23.940
What else do you guys want to talk about?

02:51:23.940 --> 02:51:26.740
Do you want to say something about popin' music, because we never talk about popin'

02:51:26.740 --> 02:51:27.740
music in the show.

02:51:27.740 --> 02:51:28.740
You want to say something about it?

02:51:28.740 --> 02:51:30.740
Want to say it, Navi?

02:51:30.740 --> 02:51:34.620
Alright, I'll say something about popin' music.

02:51:34.620 --> 02:51:39.240
It's apparently no one ever really plays it except for like me and then people in SoCal.

02:51:39.240 --> 02:51:41.100
As demonstrated by that last quiz.

02:51:41.100 --> 02:51:42.100
Yeah.

02:51:42.100 --> 02:51:43.100
News.

02:51:43.100 --> 02:51:48.860
Pop and Music 8 is coming out on July 3rd at home along with Silent Hill 3 is being

02:51:48.860 --> 02:51:52.380
released on the same date.

02:51:52.380 --> 02:51:56.780
The wonderful site Nifty slash Global Gate where you can translate all those fun Japanese

02:51:56.780 --> 02:52:01.940
pages into English clearly demonstrated how confusing their sites are.

02:52:01.940 --> 02:52:06.920
It's either that or the Japanese are weird with the way that they, I don't know.

02:52:06.920 --> 02:52:10.920
In my Japanese class I learned all kinds of stuff about their culture and how, you know,

02:52:10.920 --> 02:52:14.920
like an example, you don't say you don't want something, you just say, oh, I'll take a little

02:52:14.920 --> 02:52:20.080
of it and that means you don't want it because it's too rude to say you don't want it.

02:52:20.080 --> 02:52:26.200
Same kind of goes for when I was trying to translate these pages and read about the pre-orders

02:52:26.200 --> 02:52:30.440
for the limited edition pop and music stuff, see what the hell they're all putting in it.

02:52:30.440 --> 02:52:36.020
It looks like, from the way everything is worded and separated, they have the limited

02:52:36.020 --> 02:52:42.560
edition package and then they have the privileged limited edition package, which I don't really

02:52:42.560 --> 02:52:46.760
get what the hell is going on, but needless to say, they're loading this shit up.

02:52:46.760 --> 02:52:51.800
I don't know why they don't do this for any other Bimani games, but Pop'n Music 7 had

02:52:51.800 --> 02:52:53.120
tons and tons of stuff in it.

02:52:53.120 --> 02:52:55.200
This one has just as much.

02:52:55.200 --> 02:52:58.680
They're putting in long, besides the V-Rare CD.

02:52:58.680 --> 02:53:05.980
They have a new sticker pack with all kinds of stickers of characters and stuff.

02:53:05.980 --> 02:53:07.160
I didn't really read what it was.

02:53:07.160 --> 02:53:13.380
I think it's actually a stuffed character from the fresh genre song from Papa Music

02:53:13.380 --> 02:53:14.380
8.

02:53:14.380 --> 02:53:18.300
It looks like this little cat thing with an owl nose or something.

02:53:18.300 --> 02:53:20.300
I don't know.

02:53:20.300 --> 02:53:27.220
There's going to be a big canvas tote bag that's all Papa Music-ified.

02:53:27.220 --> 02:53:31.480
Japanese fan that's supposed to be designed from one of the ones that one

02:53:31.480 --> 02:53:37.620
of the characters was holding in Popin' Music 8. There was some more stuff too I

02:53:37.620 --> 02:53:43.740
can't remember it all but it's one big humongous package of goodies and there's

02:53:43.740 --> 02:53:49.580
going to be well over a hundred songs in Popin' Music 8. There were 54 new songs

02:53:49.580 --> 02:53:53.980
to begin with in 8 and usually with how they do the consumer stuff there'll

02:53:53.980 --> 02:53:59.580
be another 10 to 15 consumer tracks that they add on to this. So it's going to be quite

02:53:59.580 --> 02:54:05.160
a nice game. Yeah, I don't know what else to say.

02:54:05.160 --> 02:54:06.420
I'm moist of anticipation.

02:54:06.420 --> 02:54:10.740
That was so funny. One big humongous package of goodies.

02:54:10.740 --> 02:54:14.620
Yeah, Pop Music 10 is being test located right now in Japan also.

02:54:14.620 --> 02:54:17.060
I came up with a stupid thing that you could use.

02:54:17.060 --> 02:54:18.740
What?

02:54:18.740 --> 02:54:22.420
Now introducing Orange Lounge with a fresher scent.

02:54:22.420 --> 02:54:23.420
Thank you. That's very clever.

02:54:23.420 --> 02:54:35.100
Thank you very much for the pop music update, we appreciate that.

02:54:35.100 --> 02:54:38.100
We'll have to bring you back to do it again, because none of us keep tabs on pop music.

02:54:38.100 --> 02:54:40.860
The only person in the whole North State I think that plays it regularly.

02:54:40.860 --> 02:54:44.060
Oh yeah, and then I'll really get to play it once I get my arcade style controller so

02:54:44.060 --> 02:54:48.420
I can tell you how wonderful that is and then you guys can be jealous.

02:54:48.420 --> 02:54:49.980
I'll get to play it, you better let me play it.

02:54:49.980 --> 02:54:52.420
You have to bring it to an episode and then we'll just have an episode of Orange Lounge

02:55:22.420 --> 02:55:27.420
And it's got, like, a bunch of bug fixes and stuff, so we're good to go and download that. It's pretty cool.

02:55:27.420 --> 02:55:32.420
And, um, other than that, I don't think there's really anything going on.

02:55:34.420 --> 02:55:35.420
Yep.

02:55:35.420 --> 02:55:36.420
Oh.

02:55:36.420 --> 02:55:37.420
Okay.

02:55:37.420 --> 02:55:42.420
Okay, since we have such a long-ass fortune cookie message today, thanks to Jamie,

02:55:42.420 --> 02:55:47.420
I'm gonna go around and collect everyone's final thought. It's that time, it's that time of the show, you guys. End of show.

02:55:47.420 --> 02:55:50.420
So I guess since Irene's got the mic, we'll start with her. No? We're gonna start with Garrett?

02:55:50.420 --> 02:55:51.420
No.

02:55:51.420 --> 02:55:53.220
Care doesn't have a final thought.

02:55:53.220 --> 02:55:54.340
No final thought.

02:55:54.340 --> 02:55:57.940
Nellie have a final thought?

02:55:57.940 --> 02:56:01.180
This show fucking sucks, says Nellie. Thank you, we agree.

02:56:01.180 --> 02:56:03.260
Uh, Irene.

02:56:03.260 --> 02:56:07.240
Brad, final thought.

02:56:07.240 --> 02:56:12.140
Go to ragnarchonline.com and download the game.

02:56:12.140 --> 02:56:12.980
That is all.

02:56:12.980 --> 02:56:15.480
Play on Loki, that's where I am.

02:56:15.480 --> 02:56:17.380
Play on Loki.

02:56:17.380 --> 02:56:20.420
Play on KF Loki.

02:56:20.420 --> 02:56:25.720
we all just get a life. I don't think Loki would appreciate you while playing on him.

02:56:25.720 --> 02:56:32.720
Final thought, Irene? Garret's great. He did my hair and it looks so awesome. Yeah. Okay,

02:56:32.720 --> 02:56:39.720
fine. Final thought, Pixie Dust? I just want to meet a cute boy. I'm right here. What happened?

02:56:39.720 --> 02:56:49.720
I said a cute boy, not a Buddha boy. I am so offended. Get out of my house. Nigga, please.

02:56:49.720 --> 02:56:56.080
she's it she is part black she can say that word

02:56:56.080 --> 02:56:58.720
that's why i can say bad because i'm gay

02:56:58.720 --> 02:57:00.360
angel

02:57:00.360 --> 02:57:02.160
i'm so final thought

02:57:02.160 --> 02:57:06.260
i'm just glad i got to spend the weekend with my best friends ever

02:57:06.260 --> 02:57:09.280
all everybody all of you are a job

02:57:09.280 --> 02:57:11.920
all

02:57:11.920 --> 02:57:14.160
okay i don't know

02:57:14.160 --> 02:57:16.840
nagas final thought

02:57:16.840 --> 02:57:19.840
Well, haha, I'm still better than the Clippers, bitch.

02:57:22.840 --> 02:57:24.840
Anyway...

02:57:25.840 --> 02:57:28.840
Maren! Final thought.

02:57:29.840 --> 02:57:33.840
Aw, she doesn't have a final thought. Thank you for coming, Maren. Everybody give Maren a hand.

02:57:34.840 --> 02:57:38.840
Maren's great. So many new faces on tonight's show. It's nice. It's refreshing.

02:57:38.840 --> 02:57:39.840
They can't see any of them.

02:57:39.840 --> 02:57:42.840
Yeah, you can't see any of them because we were too lazy to set the webcam.

02:57:42.840 --> 02:57:45.840
You want me to go to Loki for final thought here? Okay.

02:57:45.840 --> 02:57:48.880
Richie, I love you.

02:57:48.880 --> 02:57:51.760
Loki, final thought.

02:57:51.760 --> 02:57:55.760
I hate you, PayPal.

02:57:55.760 --> 02:57:57.920
Let me just make this clear.

02:57:57.920 --> 02:57:59.600
A cute single boy.

02:57:59.600 --> 02:58:02.600
Yeah, single, straight, not gay.

02:58:02.600 --> 02:58:06.800
Because I have a lot of gay male friends.

02:58:06.800 --> 02:58:13.800
No, as in, not, I don't know, just not seeing anybody.

02:58:13.800 --> 02:58:17.800
I want the age range of 21 to 27.

02:58:17.800 --> 02:58:21.800
Yeah, exactly.

02:58:21.800 --> 02:58:25.800
I'll let Jamie have the final thought. My final thought is

02:58:25.800 --> 02:58:29.800
me and Evil Naoki 2DX, our

02:58:29.800 --> 02:58:33.800
Japanese schoolgirl love-love sugar routine is going to be the best thing ever.

02:58:33.800 --> 02:58:37.800
Jamie, your turn.

02:58:37.800 --> 02:58:41.800
My turn?

02:58:41.800 --> 02:58:46.800
I turned. No, but none of them saw that. That was bad radio.

02:58:46.800 --> 02:58:51.800
My final thought is... I just thought it. Bye.

02:58:51.800 --> 02:58:53.800
Okay. I thought my thoughts.

02:58:53.800 --> 02:58:56.800
And tonight... I'm... I'm tired.

02:58:56.800 --> 02:59:02.800
The last word of tonight's show goes to...

02:59:02.800 --> 02:59:04.800
You've had it before.

02:59:04.800 --> 02:59:07.800
Maren, because she didn't say a final word. Last word.

02:59:07.800 --> 02:59:09.800
Burna Nation.

02:59:09.800 --> 02:59:22.800
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sakura, Skye and Loki. We expect you a nice play again. And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

02:59:29.800 --> 02:59:32.800
Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.

02:59:33.800 --> 02:59:36.800
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.

02:59:36.800 --> 02:59:41.800
Yo, G, I'll be here to see why your homies ain't working their booties off.

02:59:41.800 --> 02:59:45.800
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.

02:59:45.800 --> 02:59:51.800
We be seeing if they get this ride going with six foot seven of black staring down him.

02:59:51.800 --> 02:59:55.800
I tell you that this station will be operational as planned.

02:59:55.800 --> 03:00:00.800
Well, the man don't think so, and he be cruising down here to check out this ride.

03:00:00.800 --> 03:00:02.800
The Empress coming here?

03:00:02.800 --> 03:00:05.800
Yeah, and he gonna put a cap in your white ass.

03:00:05.800 --> 03:00:07.800
We shall double our efforts.

03:00:07.800 --> 03:00:12.800
Damn straight. And remember, this be CNN.

03:00:12.800 --> 03:00:30.000
Thanks for listening and we'll see you next week.

03:01:12.800 --> 03:01:16.800
And... Fade to black.

03:01:16.800 --> 03:01:20.800
The afterbirth of Orange Lounge Radio.

03:01:20.800 --> 03:01:24.800
Not the stillbirth, the afterbirth.

03:01:24.800 --> 03:01:28.800
Anybody have anything extra they wanted to add that they didn't get out

03:01:28.800 --> 03:01:32.800
during the three hours? Something that they don't want in the archives?

03:01:36.800 --> 03:01:40.800
Wow. You're really white, you know that?

03:01:40.800 --> 03:01:45.800
I want to play that song at the very end.

03:01:45.800 --> 03:01:55.200
I didn't know Brad was married, does he have a wife?

03:01:55.200 --> 03:02:06.440
Are they in Utah?

03:02:06.440 --> 03:02:16.440
I'd just like to add an extra plug for our Bamani Music & More program, which is always on when we're not here, because we love people that listen to Orange Lawn's radio all the time.

03:02:16.440 --> 03:02:20.440
I'd like to add an extra plug to your ass, Ron.

03:02:20.440 --> 03:02:22.440
How do you know it's not already plugged?

03:02:22.440 --> 03:02:24.440
There's too many plugs in there.

03:02:24.440 --> 03:02:26.440
Oh, an extra plug, I'm sorry.

03:02:26.440 --> 03:02:31.440
You know, you remember that sex scene in The Matrix with all the plugs?

03:02:31.440 --> 03:02:44.960
I think this has been an enlightening experience, and I know this, that I'm surrounded by dirty

03:02:44.960 --> 03:02:46.720
mofos.

03:02:46.720 --> 03:02:47.720
You fit right in.

03:02:47.720 --> 03:02:54.880
I'm a dirty mofo too, so I fit just right in.

03:02:54.880 --> 03:02:55.880
Beautiful.

03:02:55.880 --> 03:02:56.880
Hey Rob.

03:02:56.880 --> 03:02:57.880
Yes.

03:02:57.880 --> 03:02:58.880
Hey Rob?

03:02:58.880 --> 03:02:59.880
Yes?

03:02:59.880 --> 03:03:02.360
Do I have a phone sex operator voice?

03:03:02.360 --> 03:03:03.360
Kinda.

03:03:03.360 --> 03:03:04.360
Why?

03:03:04.360 --> 03:03:05.880
A lot of guys tell me that for some odd reason when I'm on the phone.

03:03:05.880 --> 03:03:12.440
Why don't you give us your best phone sex operator voice right now?

03:03:12.440 --> 03:03:14.400
Let's pretend I'm calling a 900 line.

03:03:14.400 --> 03:03:15.400
Okay, here we go.

03:03:15.400 --> 03:03:18.960
This is me and Pixie S. This is me calling a straight 900 number line.

03:03:18.960 --> 03:03:19.960
Okay, ready?

03:03:19.960 --> 03:03:21.960
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.

03:03:21.960 --> 03:03:22.960
Hello.

03:03:22.960 --> 03:03:23.960
Hi.

03:03:23.960 --> 03:03:26.640
What's your name, little boy?

03:03:26.640 --> 03:03:27.640
My name is Brad.

03:03:27.640 --> 03:03:37.680
Hello Brad, what are you wearing right now?

03:03:37.680 --> 03:03:40.080
I'm wearing a red shirt and khakis.

03:03:40.080 --> 03:03:43.160
Why are you wearing so much clothing?

03:03:43.160 --> 03:03:45.160
Take it off.

03:03:45.160 --> 03:03:46.160
Okay.

03:03:46.160 --> 03:03:47.720
Why should I take it off?

03:03:47.720 --> 03:03:50.080
Because you're a naughty, naughty boy.

03:03:50.080 --> 03:03:55.880
And you know you want some miracle whip.

03:03:55.880 --> 03:03:59.360
What are you going to do to me, Miss Phone Lady?

03:03:59.360 --> 03:04:03.920
My name is Bambi, and I want to ravage your cunt.

03:04:03.920 --> 03:04:05.480
I don't have a cunt.

03:04:05.480 --> 03:04:11.940
Well, pretend you do.

03:04:11.940 --> 03:04:20.440
You all can ravage your cunts all later.

03:04:20.440 --> 03:04:22.200
I can't take it anymore.

03:04:22.200 --> 03:04:23.200
Okay.

03:04:23.200 --> 03:04:27.200
I hope that was good enough for you, baby, as good as it was for me.

03:04:27.200 --> 03:04:29.200
I came. That was so great.

03:04:29.200 --> 03:04:35.200
Oh, thank you.

03:04:35.200 --> 03:04:41.200
I imagine these phone sex operators are probably sitting back there, you know, knitting.

03:04:41.200 --> 03:04:46.200
Or doing their laundry or playing with their Game Boy while they're on the line.

03:04:46.200 --> 03:04:49.200
No, that would be you, Jamie. You'd bring a Game Boy to work.

03:05:19.200 --> 03:05:29.700
Oh yeah, it's a DDR machine. Oh God. Oh God. It does that. On the third mix, if you triple A it, it'll go, oh God, oh God, like that.

03:05:33.200 --> 03:05:46.480
You guys are horrible. Bag. Okay, we're gonna go now. Good night, everybody. Loki would like to play a quick remix for you that he really likes, and then we're gonna have a mini 2DX marathon. So you guys should enjoy that, shouldn't you?

03:05:46.480 --> 03:05:50.480
And, um, that'll be it.

03:05:50.480 --> 03:05:52.480
So, Loki, introduce this mix.

03:05:52.480 --> 03:05:54.480
This is Max Wishful.

03:05:54.480 --> 03:05:58.200
It's a remix of Max 300 and...
