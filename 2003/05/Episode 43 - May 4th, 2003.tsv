516	2858	Message for you, son!
3318	4159	Attention!
5180	8662	Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
10684	15708	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.
19378	22280	Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
22620	25782	Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
26362	29084	Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
29624	32506	Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
33307	33727	Just kidding.
33907	35508	Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.
35728	43192	In this episode... Hey, are there any balls down there?
43433	45894	That's the biggest berry you've ever seen, Jingleberry.
45994	46935	What's your favorite skit?
49142	49723	Showgirls.
50623	51784	Absolutely frightening.
52044	52585	What's yours?
52845	55326	There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.
55387	56627	Don't torture yourself.
57268	58169	That's my job.
58229	60010	Now's the time on Sprockets and me dogs!
60090	64753	I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog too!
65113	65934	I know Kung Fu.
66394	68776	I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
69036	70898	Why did they have to take the word game?
72499	75161	No one expects a Spanish exposition!
75381	76001	It's Kendo.
76021	76281	Kendo!
79093	80895	DarkSakura Shut up!
81095	81776	Where's my gun?
81916	84238	This is my boomstick!
84318	86841	Sky Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!
87141	90845	Loki I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.
90925	93708	What kind of warped human being would find that funny?
93949	95230	Orange Lounge Radio
98183	102366	We are live, and this is episode number 43 for May the 4th of 2003.
102466	110052	You're tuned into the B-Money Scene's most on-the-move radio station of all things B-Money.
110552	112494	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
112874	117297	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts, and this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.
117337	118518	You know her better as Dark Sakura.
118778	119939	I have the corner of the couch.
120620	121280	Can I register?
121700	122901	Yes, we can hear you just fine.
123362	123662	Good.
124227	126228	In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.
126468	129510	This cord is so long, I can broadcast from inside my room.
129530	130331	It's just crazy.
130391	131512	You can go in the bathroom.
132432	134654	I can go all the way into your closet, man.
134674	135194	Seriously.
135234	136535	Come out of the closet, Loki.
136575	137736	Come out of the closet, please.
138916	140457	I am broadcasting from inside my room.
144103	147106	We'll be talking, we have a brand new setup for Orange Lounge Radio tonight.
147146	152791	We'll be talking all about that after this break because I have to go and give Jamie her ferret or she's going to throw a fit.
153572	157796	There are no guests in studio yet, but we're hoping that some folks are going to show up.
159797	161939	It's kind of a new night for Orange Lounge.
162340	165462	We're not quite yet to season three, but changes are slowly happening.
165983	168045	So, it'll be interesting for sure.
168880	171964	We'll be back after some of our favorite 2DX music.
172164	172705	Enjoy!
296897	298358	Thank you for watching!
336557	345821	I just wanna scream it, baby can you hear me, hear me what I'm saying, baby please, put your love, maybe for a moment, maybe for forever, I just wanna hold you, I just wanna know you, tell me that
372056	374740	Thank you for watching.
390905	391846	Thanks for watching!
488922	493064	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
493304	495005	Do you want to be staffed by Hollywood?
495065	495385	No!
495545	499186	Do we care what people think of us?
499807	501648	No!
501668	503108	Do we want people to kiss our ass?
503588	504449	Yes!
507655	509497	Extreme Bobani Radio.
509737	512560	That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.
513361	521588	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio and as promised we're coming to you from our brand new studio which is interesting.
522169	527374	I'm hoping by next week we can have the return of the Orange Lounge webcam just so you guys can see what we're dealing with here but...
527634	532479	Get a nice one and mount it on the ceiling and have it, like, span across the room.
532580	533200	That would be pretty cool.
533220	538666	Actually, I'm thinking we might be able to mount a webcam somewhere, like, up in there where you could see, like, the whole living room and the back corner.
539467	540168	Right in the corner.
541229	542170	And see your pink carpet.
543311	544212	It's rose, damn it.
544433	544733	Pink.
545814	561005	for those that don't really follow what's going on in our personal lives which thank you for not stalking us I moved out of my house my old roommate was buying the house and was raising the rent and I'm too poe so I went to get a new place and Loki
562026	562726	Wanted a roommate.
562866	564627	Wanted to move out of where he was at, too.
564747	566408	So we decided to get an apartment together.
566928	570510	And now we are in Folsom, California, which is one of the many suburbs of Sacramento.
570830	572210	We're in the snooty town.
572230	573131	We're in the snooty suburb.
573151	575232	Wait till we get to my fuck you of the week.
576632	577153	Can't wait.
578693	579614	So now we're in Folsom.
579634	581655	And this is interesting because Loki and I live together.
582115	585976	Now it's not like we really have to be considerate of anyone else during the show.
587017	589038	Because Loki and I, being two-thirds of the staff...
590138	591659	This show pretty much runs the apartment.
592119	597301	Well, I mean, yeah, we have to be considerate of the neighbors upstairs and the neighbors next door, as we found out the other day.
597321	600223	That was only because we were allowed after 10pm.
600923	602364	Before 10pm is fair game.
603044	607326	And if they ever complain about us being too loud before 10pm, they can kiss my black ass.
607606	607966	Seriously.
608947	611108	What, after it gets kicked to that color?
612972	615874	Now what's interesting about this new setup is I'm not even looking at the chatroom right now.
615934	620957	Our microphone cords are so long that we can just walk to and from the living room.
620997	623699	And so we don't really have anyone monitoring the chatroom yet.
624059	629363	But I'm hoping that once Intern Zero gets here, maybe he can help us out by monitoring the chatroom.
629403	631124	Maybe he can tell I'm eating dry ramen.
631144	632325	What an appropriate shirt, Rob.
632945	633365	Thank you.
633686	635307	I'm wearing my Dr. Frankenfurter shirt today.
635867	636227	It's lovely.
636247	637748	What were you saying, Loki?
637969	640010	I said anything I can tell I'm eating dry ramen.
640655	641796	You're eating dry ramen.
641816	642797	That's got to be nasty.
643037	643858	I love this stuff.
643878	644218	Let me try.
644238	644858	I want to try some.
644878	645719	I'm kind of curious.
645739	648101	You have to put the chicken seasoning on, because that's awesome.
648221	649662	It's really salty and tastes damn good.
650022	651023	I don't want salty.
651063	651824	I just want to try some.
653946	654126	Ew.
655527	656027	It's weird.
658549	659830	You are a strange kid, Loki.
660170	660591	Oh, not bad.
661767	664088	So we did get a special guest joining us during that break.
664208	665629	Say hello, special guest.
666049	667630	Hello, special guest.
669131	669691	Smartass.
671112	671852	How are you doing, Bradley?
672252	673073	I'm doing okay today.
674494	677295	A big thank you, by the way, for helping Loki and I move into this place.
677875	678296	No problem.
678416	681017	What was the nastiest thing you had to move for one of us?
681317	682598	The whole underwear.
685421	685722	I don't know.
687102	688863	Maybe some old boxes of stuff.
688923	689443	Old boxes.
689943	690563	Old boxes of stuff.
691284	691844	My Pikachu.
692484	693504	Yeah, my Pikachu.
693524	694365	That was the scariest thing.
694645	695885	Bradley had to move.
696886	698586	What's interesting now is that we have a kitchen.
699927	707970	Because the way our apartment is, the kitchen is literally right next to the workstations and our living room.
708250	711151	I can't wait until we get the webcam so we can show all you guys this.
711631	716655	But you might hear Jamie kind of running back and forth to the kitchen, hurry up and cook, Popeye, and things like that.
717596	720779	I can watch Simpsons while doing a show.
720899	721319	The best.
722060	723541	Best ever.
723561	725923	But you'd be too easily distracted, Mr. Loki.
726583	728825	So?
728885	729666	That'll ruin any show.
732071	736934	But what is interesting is that now we're sitting here in the living room, we can fire up the PlayStation and play whatever games are new.
737315	739336	For instance, if we wanted to, we could fire up Max 2.
739596	740917	Yeah, if I didn't already outplay it.
741097	742198	If you didn't already outplay it.
742258	743559	Jamie, have you even seen Max 2 yet?
745140	745520	Who cares?
746401	748262	I have it too, so I've played it all too.
748282	750304	Do you have your mic over there, Jamie?
752085	753286	Jamie doesn't care she doesn't have a mic.
755422	755662	Okay.
755902	756963	I bought Max 2 also.
757043	757903	What did you think of Max 2?
757943	758944	It was pretty good.
760565	762706	There's lots of songs.
763526	766608	I need to get Kingdom Hearts Final Mix before I get Max 2.
768069	768269	Okay.
770137	771338	Jamie, you need to keep that microphone.
771378	772739	Oh wait, no, I see Bradley has it.
772759	774500	That's why you don't have it.
775921	778242	Jamie's playing with the chat room.
778262	780223	Alright, let's talk to Bradley about Max 2.
780504	780844	I'm sorry.
781704	783406	There's lots of songs like 70-something.
783846	785627	Because a lot of them are the Oni songs.
785647	789930	You have to actually play them in an Oni before you can unlock them for regular play.
789990	793312	Did you hear about the really cheap trick you can use to unlock all the Oni songs really fast?
794196	794616	No, I didn't.
794917	798019	All you do, you go into Create Your Own Oni Course, right?
798199	798379	Yeah.
798439	800240	And you set all your songs to roulette.
800660	810566	And then the steps, because you can set the level of steps you'll get on roulette, basic, middle, or basic trick, maniac, light, standard, heavy, whatever it is.
810666	811367	Challenge, yeah.
812227	813088	I hate how they change that.
813108	814909	They will forever be trick and maniac to me, damn it.
815129	818131	You set them all to challenge, and then that way you'll only get the challenge songs.
818451	822754	Oh, yeah, they're forever going to be, you know, SSR and whatever.
822774	823114	Whatever.
824675	826856	No one can hear that over here.
827656	836400	You put it on light, and then you can... So you can put all your songs on, like, 1.5 speed solo light challenge mode, and you'll have all your challenge songs in, like, under an hour.
836881	837361	So it's easy.
837801	838041	Oh, yeah.
838541	840603	That was the only way... You did the hard way.
840623	841263	Did you get them all?
841583	841703	Yeah.
841923	842323	Dang.
847166	848126	Dropout, right?
848787	849007	I thought...
853929	854950	Oh, because it's the first stage.
860497	860797	Oh, okay.
860937	862279	Well, that's kind of the same idea.
862759	863901	Random course is evil.
864281	865503	Random course is evil.
868337	879763	It's an interesting feature to add to DDR, though, where you can... Basically, the random-owning course now selects any song at random, any difficulty, well, pretty much only Trick and Maniac are the only ones that... I don't know, what did you get that one to?
879783	880783	You got, uh, what was it?
880843	882004	Burning Heat Heavy 8-Speed.
882124	885726	I got Burning Heat Heavy 8-Speed Boost.
886566	887407	I was so pissed.
894494	902856	And then, of course, we have beaten the course, or I should say Brad did, because Brad was over here, and he played the course, and he was getting four, oh wait, how many songs did he have to play?
902896	903496	Five or six?
903536	903856	I forget.
903876	904456	I think six.
904816	906757	Four of them were standard songs.
907737	911218	And, like, the hardest modifier he got was Sudden on one of the standard songs.
911318	912818	He got a Sudden on one of the standard songs.
913118	917619	And the rest was like, ooh, you know, it was like, ooh, I might have to play Two Speed or something.
917639	918520	It was sick.
918980	919720	He makes me mad.
921372	927835	I had five pretty regular ones, and then the last one was the AM3P Remix.
927935	930776	It was like 3x, thin, reverse, less flat, or combination.
942043	947805	I find what I like most about, um, it's just weird that the sound just changed right there.
949486	951767	Are we still, hold on, I'm gonna make sure we're still going.
953407	954287	Something got unplugged.
956668	956968	Hello?
957068	957309	Hello?
957409	958309	Okay, they can still hear us.
959209	960390	Yeah, but it got louder all of a sudden.
960490	963991	Yeah, I don't know what happened.
964071	964651	We got louder.
965031	965291	Oh well.
967032	968332	Normally it means something got unplugged.
968953	969593	How you doing, Bradley?
969613	969753	Bradley?
971804	972385	I'll fix it.
972405	972866	Can you hear me?
973227	977556	Yeah, we can hear everybody, so... Hello, anyone out there?
977696	978197	That was weird.
978417	979039	Alright, whatever.
980502	981303	Anyway, where were we?
982119	985441	Oh, you're talking about Max 2 for Japanese system.
986522	991845	I think, I actually, what I like most about Max 2 is, like, I like those Oni course songs.
991965	995148	Like, they're, it's kind of neat to be able to play them at home whenever you want.
995988	1000131	Because I was playing a lot of those on Extreme, and now I can play them at home.
1000551	1003073	But what sucks is that they didn't add any new steps to them.
1003793	1004934	It's just the challenge steps.
1005333	1006474	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1028703	1030404	They've gotten licensed songs from the get-go.
1030564	1031965	We've gotten fucked every single time.
1032806	1036848	Except for Max USA, and they're like, oh, here you go, licensed songs.
1037128	1038089	Well, gee, it's about time.
1038129	1039750	You're only like, you know, two mixes behind.
1040851	1047035	What's going to be interesting, though, is the news, and that'll be a big show when we hear when B3's over, what comes out of that.
1048155	1049316	Yes, that is a microphone, Jamie.
1049476	1050357	You like that one, don't you?
1052038	1053079	It's a condenser mic.
1053319	1054299	I just need a mic sting.
1055080	1057301	That's going to be the one that's going to record background noise.
1057902	1058282	Oh, goody.
1062273	1064695	Hmm.
1065596	1067577	Jamie's getting all angsty over her pot pie.
1069939	1070659	Loki, what are you doing?
1071800	1072761	I'm seeing this on TV.
1072781	1074602	You're going to turn on the TV during the show?
1075503	1075963	Hell yeah.
1076424	1079006	You need to get a VCR so you don't get so easily distracted.
1080947	1082108	You're watching The Weakest Link.
1084750	1087152	Did you guys forget we do a radio show Sunday nights?
1087172	1087232	Yes.
1091414	1092654	I'm turning the channel.
1092674	1095315	I want to go back to... Why are we watching Game Show Network?
1095475	1096655	I was watching the Game Show Network.
1096675	1098215	I was watching $100,000 Pyramid.
1098455	1099976	Oh my god, I saw the coolest game.
1100096	1100316	What?
1100736	1102016	Who Wants to Beat Up a Millionaire.
1102896	1105077	On Dreamcast.
1105237	1106157	That's hella old.
1106197	1107677	That was like an old, old Dreamcast game.
1107697	1109577	Yeah, but I didn't pay attention to the crap games.
1110578	1111198	Did you buy it?
1111418	1111698	No.
1112238	1112878	Ross is playing it.
1114238	1114978	How does it work?
1115718	1118219	Your question right, you get to beat up a millionaire for money.
1121585	1123646	Loki's trying to figure out how to use digital cable right now.
1123666	1125246	We're stuck on the weakest link right now.
1125266	1126106	When are you getting TiVo?
1126126	1127087	So slow.
1127107	1129427	We're getting TiVo when I'm not ghetto poor anymore, Jamie.
1130908	1131388	Oh, 5-5?
1131648	1136770	I mean... I know how to do this.
1137970	1138230	Shut up.
1138810	1142812	Well, so... This is an interesting perspective here.
1143512	1143892	How so?
1144192	1146033	I'm in front of the computer this time.
1146113	1147613	I think this is the A-team.
1148373	1149214	Whoa, the A-team is cool.
1149254	1150634	No, it's Thunderball, uncut.
1151229	1151349	Oh.
1151949	1154750	Can you turn it down for us or mute it until your show's on or whatever?
1155451	1156411	I don't want to watch this anyways.
1156471	1158652	I thought that most extreme elimination challenge is going to be on.
1158772	1159132	Fuck this.
1161273	1162414	Do you want to put in Max 2?
1162474	1163954	We can play a little Max 2 on air.
1165155	1166415	Show off our new equipment.
1166435	1170117	See, that's really going to do good for the listeners because they can just hear the music.
1170137	1173138	And hear, oh, you're doing shitty.
1174465	1175305	Whoa, another AAA.
1175326	1177807	Why don't you try practicing in a closet?
1178087	1179028	I just kick ass.
1179088	1180348	Another AAA again?
1180468	1181129	Oh my god.
1181849	1182730	I'm gonna do this blindfold.
1182790	1183890	Oh, look, another AAA.
1184611	1185051	Come on.
1185091	1186392	What the fuck is this?
1187733	1189694	Ghost in the Shell movie CD?
1193356	1202741	Remember, like, before CDs, when they used to sell, like, movie CDs at CompUSA, where you could, like, it was on, like, two CDs, and it was just basically one giant AVI file or something?
1202761	1203522	You mean it's a VCD.
1204358	1205939	Hey, there's Final Fuck X.
1227822	1228923	I burned that for you.
1229423	1230404	All the porn's behind me.
1231245	1233106	Should we look through some of Loki's interesting porn?
1233586	1234567	Hey, let's watch porn.
1234787	1235888	Do you want to put on some porn?
1236229	1236609	Sure, why not?
1236669	1237630	I want to watch something funny.
1239131	1239871	I need comedy.
1240091	1242693	Let's go back to the Orange Lounge Radio roots and watch some porn.
1245335	1246076	Dude, it's comedy.
1246096	1246536	This is great.
1246777	1247957	I'm loving this new facility.
1248278	1250039	Now we don't just have to talk about porn.
1250419	1251420	We can watch porn.
1260449	1261309	Jackal and Hyde.
1262430	1265330	Wait, let's talk, let's take a chat room vote.
1265530	1266411	Jamie, can you monitor the chat room?
1266431	1267631	Hey, you have the bad anime one.
1268291	1270851	Can you monitor the chat room, Jamie, and see which one of these they want to watch?
1270871	1273592	Okay, I'm just going to go by based on biggest response.
1273612	1274492	Hand me that big stack.
1274592	1276893	Okay, let me... Loki, hand me your big stack.
1279413	1280414	Stack overflow.
1282554	1284454	We have The Watcher 3.
1285595	1287175	Oh, it's Mirage's first anal.
1288547	1292790	Let's see, we have DNA Hunter, Volume 1, totally uncensored.
1292830	1295812	This is animated, but it's voiced by adult stars.
1297234	1300896	Now, chat room, since there's a little lag, you're going to have to type the name of the porno that you want to see.
1301497	1302538	Really loud, so Jamie sees.
1302758	1303578	This one's lame.
1304039	1306140	Oh, it's Jenna Jameson in Cruise in Jennaville.
1306400	1307081	It kind of looks lame.
1307161	1310223	It's one of those stupid softcore, like, I'm getting naked and touching myself things.
1310644	1311344	Really retarded.
1312225	1313326	You don't have any gay porn, huh?
1313886	1314467	I used to.
1314487	1316148	Hey, I have that one you gave me in my trunk.
1317879	1320301	Oh, that's right, there's a gay porn out, yeah, in the trunk.
1321001	1323723	Okay, so we have, we have a random gay porn we can watch, too.
1325184	1326004	Um, let's see, what's this?
1326745	1328786	Karen, totally uncensored.
1328806	1330547	By the way, you think this show's gone to the toilet?
1330587	1331528	Well, we don't care what you think.
1333409	1336290	Jekyll and Hyde, with multiple angles.
1337251	1337431	Oh!
1337491	1338132	Multiple angles.
1339032	1339452	Let's see.
1340133	1342194	Real wild girls out of control.
1342234	1343615	Gravitation is not porn.
1343635	1345676	That's the Winter Ghetto version of Girls Gone Wild.
1345876	1346817	It's just horrible.
1349215	1349955	That's actually pretty good.
1349995	1350935	I don't think there's anything in there.
1351015	1352036	No, there is.
1352776	1353636	It's a Playboy disc.
1353836	1357517	No, there isn't anything in there.
1357697	1360497	Instead of Sailor Moon, it's Sailor and the Seven Balls.
1361018	1364498	Awful, awful, awful animation.
1364598	1365078	I'm curious.
1365098	1365698	Let me see that.
1367199	1367899	Let me borrow that.
1368719	1371160	I want to see how bad it is.
1371800	1372880	Sex and the Stranger.
1377071	1378457	Also, some of them have two DVDs.
1378538	1380566	Never mind, this looks really stupid.
1380707	1381209	Couples.
1382239	1383460	This looks more than stupid.
1383800	1384360	Oh, Treasure Hunt.
1384380	1386002	This looks like it was done in Flash.
1386562	1387803	That was done in Flash.
1388083	1390485	It's an erotic paradise and ten million dollars.
1390985	1393086	Only one catch, you gotta live to collect.
1393427	1395928	So it's like porn and they beat each other up.
1395948	1398510	No one wants to see this either, it's softcore crap.
1398530	1400051	I just kind of put them all.
1400191	1402393	Okay, the rest is, oh, no, it's softcore too.
1403413	1405635	Okay, the rest is good.
1405775	1407196	A Heat for All Seasons.
1407436	1410218	That's a fairly popular hentai, if I'm not mistaken.
1413128	1418413	Nubian Nurse Orgy Nubian?
1419294	1420274	Oh, I think that wins.
1420815	1423297	Okay, so we have Nubian Nurse Orgy in the lead.
1424358	1425459	Hurry up, because I'm bored.
1426460	1427901	Interactive Mind Teaser.
1428001	1428661	That sounds stupid.
1428681	1429302	That's an actual game.
1429322	1431264	You have to do work to get naked pictures in that one.
1431304	1432805	Ooh, and then Seven Deadly Sins.
1433706	1434266	That one's funny.
1435787	1437389	Okay, we're going to watch Nubian Nurse Orgy.
1437429	1438610	I don't care what the chatroom thinks.
1438630	1440572	Okay.
1442375	1443196	Well, then they lose.
1444337	1445958	Oh, we don't have a DVD player hooked up, do we?
1447499	1448560	Okay, we'll have to get that.
1448620	1452864	Okay, that'll be something we can look forward to after the break then, is Nubian Nurse Orgy.
1453684	1453865	What?
1466118	1468499	Actually, we have a stand-alone DVD player somewhere.
1468540	1469500	At least I had one the other day.
1470941	1471521	Did you find it?
1473002	1473202	Good.
1473382	1474123	We have a DVD player.
1474683	1476364	So we have that to look for.
1476424	1478665	Yes, the carpeting in here is pink.
1478746	1479406	Isn't it lovely?
1485690	1490112	So, Jamie, you bought yourself a book the other day.
1490492	1491073	Yes, I did.
1491213	1491793	What did you buy?
1492193	1492934	Battle Royale.
1493394	1494055	It's about time.
1494155	1494555	How is it?
1495439	1497860	Um, I bought it two days ago.
1499581	1501162	And this is just reading it in the bathroom.
1502442	1504123	So you're about a quarter of the way, about?
1504943	1506084	No, maybe about a fifth.
1506104	1507204	How many kids are still alive?
1508585	1508945	Girl, hold on.
1511586	1513007	Yeah, the chapter's in with the body count.
1513487	1514428	Uh, 30 students removed.
1515828	1517549	So, a quarter of them are down, basically.
1517569	1518650	Yeah.
1518670	1518910	Nice.
1522991	1523912	Oh my god, the best.
1525031	1531693	Yeah.
1535794	1536054	Hmm.
1537054	1537615	Kind of gross.
1537815	1538975	And they all eat the cookies.
1541056	1542456	Shuya got to have the cookies.
1546437	1548578	Anything else going on in the Bomani world, Loki?
1548618	1550258	What's new in Sim Land?
1550858	1551718	Is there anything new in Sim Land?
1551738	1553599	Let him hook up the DVD player first.
1555171	1555993	Jeez, Rob.
1556594	1556994	Jeez.
1557074	1557896	Crack that whip.
1558457	1561643	Sorry, I forgot for a minute that we're not a Bomani show.
1563673	1565314	I have something new in the Bitmoney world.
1565574	1565774	What?
1566054	1567734	I haven't played any Bitmoney in a week.
1569375	1570215	Congratulations.
1570235	1570856	No, I played 2DX.
1570876	1571656	Did you?
1571956	1573837	You saw me beat Last Message twice in a row.
1573857	1574097	That's right.
1574137	1575297	You're beating Seven Stars now.
1575697	1575977	Yep.
1576057	1577058	Did you beat another one, too?
1577078	1577118	No.
1577538	1578558	You beat Please Don't Go, right?
1578578	1579058	I beat Please Don't Go.
1579078	1579799	That was my first one.
1579819	1580919	My second one was Monkey Dance.
1581479	1581859	Oh, okay.
1582139	1586461	I've beaten Nine O'Clocks, but it was on Easy, and I border bonused, so it doesn't count.
1586581	1587001	Doesn't count.
1588962	1589202	So...
1589964	1592486	I've sort of... I haven't been... You know, it's weird.
1592546	1596348	It's hard to get back into the swing of things right now because I honestly feel like we haven't done a show in a month.
1596748	1600671	And then to come back and do a show here, like at a brand new place, it's weird.
1600731	1604053	It doesn't even... It doesn't feel... It doesn't... Yeah, it doesn't feel serious right now.
1604093	1609696	Maybe it's going to take us until our... until our Season 3 premiere, until we feel serious.
1614819	1615439	Yes, that's right.
1615480	1619442	We now... I remember that.
1627343	1634845	You know, I remember I used to have those little Sesame Street books, and I would get the little records, and you could play on the record player, and it would go, and now, turn the page.
1635146	1636846	And it made the little chime, and you could turn the page.
1637006	1637226	Yes.
1638527	1639447	I had Garfield ones.
1639487	1639907	Those were cool.
1639927	1649511	And the hardest one to find was...
1651994	1653415	We might want to pull the blinds.
1655897	1657979	Because that's the last thing we need are more complaints.
1663184	1665686	Now they're going to wonder what we do in here.
1674594	1675214	Porn is funny.
1675394	1676375	Porn is comedy.
1676555	1678317	Wait, so are we going to take a break and then do porn?
1678337	1679578	They said turn on the freaking mic.
1680322	1683403	The mics are on.
1683963	1684523	Watch our audio.
1684563	1685624	Make sure we have audio going out.
1687565	1688485	La, la, la.
1688805	1690546	Yeah, we freaking have them on.
1696668	1697988	They keep cutting out or something?
1698008	1700269	Bring up the studio broadcaster.
1705006	1708789	and then when you just keep an eye on that and make sure we don't drop.
1710070	1712612	I think this one is unconnected at the bottom.
1712992	1714894	It's unconnecting.
1717196	1719177	That explains why our volume keeps jumping.
1720838	1721679	Okay, just one sec.
1721719	1722119	No one talk.
1733709	1734129	Dead air.
1737895	1738295	Sorry about that.
1738696	1739016	Hello.
1739496	1740137	Okay, we're good.
1743839	1744540	Oh, maybe not.
1748443	1751145	Boy, this is the greatest episode of Orange Lounge Radio ever.
1756669	1765796	Okay, well, I still see that we're getting... I have to check on your pot pie?
1765956	1766236	Fine.
1767642	1777709	Your pot pie has... Maybe we should go to music.
1778629	1779910	15 minutes for your pot pie.
1780991	1783312	Yeah, let's go to music right now.
1783433	1784413	Now's a good time to break.
1792058	1792639	Okay, what?
1792679	1793479	What do you want me to say?
1797102	1797382	Hi.
1798584	1798644	Hi.
1798744	1801566	Hello, hello, hello, hello.
1801586	1806269	You gotta go to C, C colon, and then Orange Lounge.
1806289	1807670	Echo, echo.
1812119	1812659	B3?
1813260	1815801	Oh yeah, B3's coming up, that'll be fun, that's in two weeks.
1816141	1830127	Okay, we have, this weekend is episode 43, next weekend's episode 44, then we have the week after that, the 17th and the 18th, we have B3, which is this huge tournament that's happening at the Riptide Arcade in San Francisco, which I went to for the first time this week, by the way.
1830867	1832208	It's pretty nifty.
1832368	1837610	If I remember right, a lot of the flooring is wood, so it feels like you're playing video games on a pier, so it's interesting.
1838731	1840952	Well, because you are, because you're on the pier and playing an arcade, but...
1842691	1848515	Yeah, about four songs.
1848795	1854019	So we have B3 and we're going to be broadcasting live from B3 all day long, Saturday and Sunday.
1854840	1857602	And if you think this is interesting radio, wait till you hear that.
1858522	1863185	Hopefully you guys were listening during our March Madness broadcast or if you remember way back to the Shaft broadcast.
1865127	1868749	We'll talk more about B3 and all that after the break when we get some more mics hooked up.
1868829	1869470	So we'll be back.
1938785	1940128	Thanks for watching!
2012346	2012534	Thanks for watching!
2170491	2171835	Thanks for watching!
2230280	2235723	Orange Lounge Radio with the Ping Pong Balls.
2239385	2240486	We're back.
2241547	2242988	And you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
2243528	2246550	I felt the urge to do that brand dance.
2247110	2247750	The brand dance?
2247770	2248071	Yeah.
2248711	2249391	During Night in Motion?
2249612	2249872	Yeah.
2250732	2251533	Cool.
2251793	2254354	I guess many people probably don't get that.
2255515	2256456	Can you tell the story then?
2256476	2256916	I wasn't there.
2256936	2258217	I don't know what I was doing.
2260661	2265324	I remember, though, everyone at AX 2001, I think it was.
2266705	2267385	There was a tournament.
2267585	2268846	See, I wasn't there for the tournament either.
2268886	2269927	I just decided not to do it.
2270407	2275070	But everyone for freestyle for the post-qualifiers got up there and did Night in Motion.
2275991	2276591	Everybody did.
2277592	2278492	Got up there and did Night in Motion.
2280333	2280594	Anyway.
2282194	2284156	My pot pie is taunting me.
2286297	2287718	Rob's tweaking with a thingy.
2289144	2289604	He's pinching it.
2289624	2290925	He's trying to make one of the mics a little louder.
2290945	2292086	He's trying to make it get decided.
2294787	2295768	I don't need to be loud!
2295788	2303212	See, Rob needs the one where he needs to have his volume down.
2303232	2304193	Yeah, you need to turn mine down.
2305394	2306354	I have a voice that carries.
2309456	2313458	So, hey, Loki reminded me during the break of a Bomani topic.
2313779	2315960	You remember how DDR's coming out for the Xbox?
2315980	2316060	Yeah.
2317259	2318140	You mean that bullshit?
2318240	2323625	Yeah, well, they have the first screenshot out now, and it looks like Drop the Bomb is going to be in it.
2324185	2325386	I still think that's bullshit.
2326227	2326908	How's it bullshit?
2327488	2329770	I still think that it's a big bullshit hoax.
2331271	2332392	You think DDR on X?
2334014	2334995	What are you doing, Loki?
2335635	2336896	I was getting on my internet.
2337257	2340399	I forgot that the sound from mine... Sorry.
2345495	2346575	Well, that's, you know why?
2346955	2357057	Because a certain somebody who was on the internet looking up address directions had their cable hooked up to that one and not mine, so I couldn't hook it up because we don't know how to use the router and we suck.
2359978	2361238	Okay, I can set up your router.
2363539	2364939	Well, not now, because we're doing a show.
2367760	2370560	You still think, you think DDR on Xbox is still a big hoax?
2370580	2372140	There's an official press release.
2372721	2374541	There's an official press release on it, okay.
2375342	2377122	I didn't say it was a hoax, I said it's crap.
2377262	2377902	Oh, it's crap.
2378142	2379283	That I concur.
2381123	2382283	And I'm probably going to have it.
2382823	2385684	Because we get all this stuff that they put out for Xbox because they send it to us for free.
2386024	2386564	That's cool.
2387524	2389904	Well, I'm not buying an Xbox for it.
2389924	2390985	They think that I'm doing that.
2391265	2395205	The only way I'd ever buy an Xbox is if they came out with Mario Kart for the Xbox.
2395605	2398246	But since that'll never ever happen, I don't need an Xbox.
2399486	2402026	However, Mario Kart Double Dash, oh yeah.
2402407	2405127	But they don't have Mario Kart on the PS2 and you have one of those.
2406263	2408645	Yeah, but that's because I needed Final Fantasy 8.
2410747	2412168	Final Fantasy 8 was PS1, not PS2.
2412288	2414210	Okay, that's because I needed Final Fantasy 10.
2414550	2415070	Oh, okay.
2415250	2417352	What did I buy PS2 for?
2418173	2420515	I bought Armored Core 2 was my first game, I think.
2421396	2423257	I just wanted one because it was cool.
2423597	2429082	Because all the cool kids on the block had a PS2.
2429622	2433546	Well, I bought a PS1 beforehand when Final Fantasy 7 came out.
2433586	2435047	That was the reason why I bought that one.
2435067	2435107	Oh.
2436300	2437161	Oh So Worth It 2.
2437861	2438882	I haven't heard the buzzer go off.
2442825	2444426	What else is new in Bomani World right now?
2444466	2445466	And there are other stuff going on.
2445506	2448568	There's still 2DX Night Style news that slowly trickles in.
2448588	2452911	It looks like all the songs that are coming back into 2DX are up.
2452971	2455433	I remember you posted something in your live journal about it, right Bradley?
2456194	2456634	Was that you?
2458295	2459216	Oh, you want to talk about this?
2459276	2459396	Here.
2461451	2464752	Well, I saw a link on DDR Freak and I posted that.
2464792	2489996	Basically, they had a longer list of returning songs, which included some of the new ones are Diving into the Night, Empathy, North also, Lame, Cleone, and there's like one or two others that were new.
2490968	2493931	The biggest update ever is that Tourney Mix 4 has been announced.
2509910	2513813	That's, well, I would get on the internet and check what the date was.
2513853	2518076	I think it was on the June 19th or something like that, if my memory serves me right.
2519117	2520097	So that's coming up.
2520778	2524660	They pretty much outlawed any DDR songs.
2524921	2530064	It's pretty much only pop and music and Guitar Freaks, I think, or Fair Game, if I remember correctly.
2530785	2533387	And then anything else you want to do.
2533987	2536569	I think they were sick of people doing stupid remixes of...
2537825	2538805	Max 300 and shit.
2539206	2539866	Amen.
2540106	2541967	Thank you, whoever made that decision.
2543047	2545888	Yeah, because stupid people out there think that they can remix.
2546068	2548469	Wait a minute though, that means you can't enter Legend of Trance, huh?
2548509	2549469	Because that's decent.
2549930	2550390	No, I can't.
2550550	2551010	That sucks.
2551110	2552451	But you know what, I'll just make something else.
2552831	2554151	Or I'll just get something else to come.
2555552	2557012	Excuse me, you've got another mix.
2558053	2559633	Yeah, but there's no Beatmania either.
2559653	2562194	Damn.
2562214	2562754	Or remixes.
2562774	2563855	What a bunch of bitches.
2564605	2568426	But wasn't it on, um, it wasn't in the TACO movie, was it?
2569106	2569406	Damn.
2570226	2570806	Make another one.
2571267	2572307	I'll make another one.
2572527	2574627	I've got crap I was working on.
2575568	2579088	I have stuff that I'm working on right now, but it doesn't sound that good, I think.
2580689	2581069	I don't know.
2582089	2585810	See, there was, I can pull it up right now, there was
2587597	2591160	If anyone wants to hear a preview of this one, I guess I can play it.
2591180	2592521	Oh, you're going to play us a preview?
2592902	2593322	Oh, yeah.
2593682	2594223	I don't know.
2594263	2598006	I might scrap this whole thing because I don't know if I can work with this remix.
2598046	2598787	Yeah, play the preview.
2598807	2599307	Play the preview.
2599448	2600408	Okay, here we go.
2600989	2603731	This is a... I haven't even titled it yet.
2603972	2607535	It's just a remix of The Sound of Goodbye, so here we go.
2630647	2631310	Thank you for watching!
2694912	2696554	And that's all I have, really, right now.
2697334	2698075	You know what, though?
2698355	2701819	Because you're not going to even be able to use that one either, because that's a 2DX song.
2702299	2702539	I know.
2704241	2705322	Well, what else did I have?
2705362	2706563	I had some other shit in here.
2707504	2710106	Anyways, so that's going on.
2711508	2714651	See, other than that... Remix of Jet World.
2716132	2717994	Yeah, do a transfer music with a Tar Freak song.
2719244	2742869	I can't because there's not a, the problem is there's a lot of songs, especially the stuff I've been picking now, has either full length version stuff for it, or like, because you need to like be able to like catch the different instruments in there, so because I don't have like an 8 track of it where it has everything separated, you know, so I have to take long, long versions of it so that I can cut different sections out of it and use it.
2744249	2744970	But, I don't know.
2745050	2747792	I'm probably gonna, like I said before, I'm gonna probably cut that one.
2748113	2748853	What's this one?
2750915	2751515	Uh, what is this?
2751636	2752036	Let's see.
2753397	2755178	Oh, this one I don't think sounded that good.
2755199	2756580	I think I scrapped this one.
2756600	2759402	This is like... Yeah, that's awful.
2759462	2759642	Okay.
2762675	2764416	I don't know.
2766177	2767438	Camelinda Techno.
2767678	2768759	Camelinda Techno?
2768799	2769399	I want to hear that.
2769839	2770820	I don't even think there's anything.
2770940	2772421	No, I didn't even do anything on this.
2772541	2774142	I just, like, it was an idea.
2774162	2775623	I still might do something.
2775643	2776643	You need to finish that one.
2776663	2777824	Camelinda Techno?
2777844	2778404	I want to hear that.
2779245	2781986	There was other news that's sort of Omani-related.
2782086	2782446	All right.
2782526	2783167	It came out this week.
2783187	2783607	What's that?
2785488	2786228	Nukutamo.
2787549	2788230	Oh, God.
2788390	2789250	All right, play one of those.
2790111	2790531	Here we go.
2794822	2799385	I'm thinking of you, I was a fool to let you walk away Yes, in my life today, make my world the color of blue
2822113	2823113	Thanks for watching!
2845462	2847183	I am Carven, Scarlet with one, only one
2879958	2881200	Thank you for watching!
2901309	2903930	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2926609	2931913	Okay, so that one was released this week as well as Y31.
2932073	2934555	Unfortunately, I do not have the MP3 for Y31 right now.
2934675	2936597	Oh darn, bummer, what a shame, we can't hear it.
2936617	2946886	But, if you're looking for the link, I don't remember exactly what it was off the top of my head, but I know if you go to our forums, which are on KaliBimani.com,
2947466	2948287	Good plug!
2948627	2962739	Um, you can go there and you'll see a thread that's called, um, Kinda Off Topic But, and that's where I post everything, because, um, our Sack of Mind boards are still down, and, um, so that's where I post all these cool links that I find, and you'll find the link in there.
2965341	2966602	I need to get login info.
2968484	2975149	So, you'll find the links there, and he keeps releasing more, um, I can't remember what else he was working on, but those are two that are definitely good.
2975530	2975830	And, um,
2976741	2977761	Colors is awesome, so.
2979642	2987923	Other than that, you know, V-Rare 5 came out, and people, you know, listened to that, and there's some pretty good stuff on it.
2988223	2990204	V-Rare 5 kind of sucked compared to the other ones.
2990224	2991284	I mean, it was okay.
2991404	2995465	I was all excited because it was all these trance remixes, but I don't know.
2995505	2997785	Kind Lady just wasn't meant to be trance remixed.
2998306	2999246	I like that one.
2999506	2999766	I don't.
3000026	3000366	I don't.
3000806	3002026	But Midnight Blaze was pretty good.
3002246	3004507	I'm still waiting for the Safari trance edition.
3004587	3004827	Jamie!
3004847	3004987	Jamie!
3007395	3010338	and Feelings Won't Fade was kind of just Look to the Sky again.
3010358	3012980	Feelings Won't Fade, I Swear to God, is another song.
3013100	3016744	I've heard that synth chorus before or whatever.
3017605	3019807	I've heard that melody before and I know it's another song.
3019867	3023231	I know the dumb idiot ripped someone off, but I just have to find the original.
3024892	3026474	Then I Feel was lame.
3026714	3027675	What the hell was that?
3027775	3030258	It was like Tori Amos doing I Feel.
3035554	3042716	I'm healing, I'm healing, I'm healing, I'm healing, I'm healing, I'm healing, I'm healing
3062182	3064069	Why do we crucify ourselves?
3098632	3099813	I feel like any all of a sudden.
3101795	3102816	I played the full song there.
3103076	3115248	Those people out there that are recording are going to make another... I feel... No, it makes me have to go to the bathroom.
3115328	3116649	I have to make a gift.
3121717	3128400	Out of everything that was unlocked in Max 2, I'd have to say the best one had to have been Do It Right, the 80s Electromix.
3128660	3130621	I love 80s music, and that was awesome.
3131181	3133442	Now, Kindly the Interlude was alright too.
3133862	3136803	Look to the Sky Transmix was alright as well, but I don't know.
3138404	3144046	I'm just pissed that Do It Right has so many remixes done to it so far, and Dead End has none.
3144486	3146667	You know what's cool about Look to the Sky Transmix?
3147388	3147888	The background.
3148048	3148388	That's it.
3149808	3150809	The background's pretty cool.
3151668	3152469	I like it, okay?
3153410	3156552	Because it's actually, it's a different song if you listen to the full version.
3157453	3159154	You can tell it's a different song.
3159654	3161436	Now, the one I was really pissed off on...
3163117	3163918	I actually like Hyper Eurobeat
3193646	3194367	Well, you know what?
3194527	3196889	I would play it for you, but I don't have the MP3 because... I have it.
3197129	3197369	I have it.
3198030	3198510	Let me bring it up.
3199071	3199351	All right.
3200192	3200752	Well, I'll tell you what.
3201292	3204615	It's kind of long for a break song, but I'll bring it up and we can play a clip from it.
3204835	3205756	I can play the 80s electro.
3205856	3207737	Do you want to do it right there?
3207777	3208138	No, let's do it.
3208158	3208758	We'll do that during break.
3208798	3208998	Okay.
3209018	3209499	We'll do it during break.
3209519	3209739	All right.
3210259	3215524	We'll play all the DDR edits during the next break, but here, I'll play Glacial because Jamie wants to hear it.
3216164	3218306	So, we'll play a little bit of it, okay?
3218326	3218406	Okay.
3221949	3223151	No, the oven should be off, Bradley.
3223171	3223511	Thank you.
3227697	3228699	Slap Jamie on the wrist.
3231202	3233045	Okay, here's a little bit of Glacier, okay?
3261416	3262610	Thank you for watching!
3287492	3288453	That's a little clip of it.
3288473	3289653	What do you think of that, Jamie?
3290174	3291395	Jamie doesn't have a mic back there, does she?
3291595	3292095	Go give her a mic.
3294136	3294557	I like it.
3295537	3296378	It's not Politary.
3296998	3301181	Although, actually, when Politary's singing it, though, she's actually in tune.
3302182	3304163	That's the only reason why I actually like Hyper Eurobeat.
3304863	3305784	And it's got fun steps.
3306945	3311327	Easy, but... Alright, um, hey, you wanna watch... It makes me want to burp or something.
3311648	3313069	Did you wanna watch a little bit of that porno now?
3314730	3315150	Excuse me.
3315794	3316575	Do you want to turn on the porn?
3316775	3317235	Turn on the porn.
3318076	3318936	While I set up for break.
3319196	3319797	I'm not moving.
3321278	3322139	Loki, turn on the porn.
3322179	3323580	He's jumping to turn on the porn.
3325241	3326662	I'm setting up for a break here.
3329984	3330845	Play porn.
3331966	3333547	Ooh, porn.
3334147	3335188	It's porntastic.
3336029	3336689	Chaperific.
3339991	3340912	Rescue input.
3343414	3344615	Nubian nurse orgy.
3348263	3354427	Starring... Too many people, I can't read it!
3355007	3355568	Brazil?
3355888	3357389	I think I saw Cinnabuns in there.
3357689	3358410	Coco Flame.
3361252	3362973	Kitten Coco.
3366055	3367195	Can we skip to the fucking?
3369477	3370698	Hold on, Pebbles!
3377502	3378282	Oh, sorry.
3378302	3380104	I was just thinking of a claw.
3389191	3391333	How exactly are these folks Nubian nurses?
3392234	3394415	Because they're black and they're dressed up like nurses.
3400560	3401401	Do-do-do-do-do.
3403976	3406657	Yeah, there's really no plot to this at all.
3406977	3411578	It's just like, we're in a hospital and stuff happens and I'm horny now.
3415599	3416799	What about all the patients that are dying?
3416859	3420801	That chick that looks like Tyra Banks is having her tits eaten.
3428603	3429803	Oh yeah, she has like a tan line.
3437261	3438782	This is a big mole on her ass, too.
3442284	3446747	Okay, yeah, she has an ass, but... Can I skip to another chapter?
3447047	3447648	Go right ahead.
3447888	3450910	We need to get some moaning or something, because this is really horrible radio right here.
3451350	3451710	Let's see.
3452190	3453551	Let's see if I can skip a chapter here.
3462597	3463938	Oh, damn, she looks pregnant!
3470242	3470642	I love it.
3470682	3473203	It's like elevator porn.
3475084	3476385	Dude, she's not pregnant.
3476425	3477585	She's just fucking fat.
3478365	3479086	It's like tubby.
3482327	3482947	She's got back.
3484428	3485168	She doesn't got back.
3485188	3486028	She's got rolls.
3490210	3494812	Dang, that one chick is totally... Dude, I need to find my remote.
3495012	3495752	I feel dirty.
3495772	3496993	That's what we need to find.
3497904	3500586	All right, I think we're going to go to a break now.
3503407	3508491	We're going to go to a break, and during this break, you can send us your FUs of the week, because we're going to do those when we get back.
3508551	3509671	So send us your FUs of the week.
3509691	3512333	You can send those over a private message to me in the chat room.
3512373	3513314	My name is Skye.
3513534	3515195	Dude, her nipples are, like, bigger than her hips.
3515695	3518397	And if you're not in the chat room, you can get in there right now.
3518437	3521078	Just go over to www.callybomani.com.
3522760	3525202	and then click on Orange Lounge and then click on Chat.
3525403	3526343	It's just that simple.
3526784	3534292	And we'll see you on the other side of this break, which will feature all three of the brand new, new, new songs in Max 2.
3534332	3537235	We have Do It Right, Kind Lady, and Look to the Sky, all remixed.
3537295	3538116	Enjoy, we'll be back.
3632884	3635086	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
3691147	3694474	I am the cure, when you wake up late thinking it's a dream
3737279	3737839	Thanks for watching!
3817519	3823783	Oh, ask!
3824344	3826986	This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.
3831858	3832899	Hi, we are back.
3833600	3836182	And what are you guys watching now?
3836642	3838524	You changed the porno and put something else in.
3839505	3843708	That porno is boring, so we're watching Sailor Moon and the Seven Balls.
3845109	3845710	Dear Lord.
3846010	3850133	Can we pause it or turn off the video or something for a minute so we can do the FUs of the week?
3850594	3854337	So we can kind of get back to the show that we try to do every Sunday night here.
3856809	3865672	I know you may have forgotten after a week off Oh, big apologies by the way for episode 42 No shit I'm sure Loki enjoyed it
3868891	3876153	Basically what happened with that is, if you're a regular in the chatroom, you did get to see Jamie and myself, and Brad was there too.
3876193	3880414	We did episode 42 on Thursday night, so episode 42, it does exist, it was done.
3880834	3892978	However, I foolishly fucked up the archive file, so Loki tried to do an episode 42 part 2 on Sunday night, except we only had dial-up in the house at the time, and it didn't quite work.
3893958	3897739	What was the highlight of episode 42 for you, Jamie, the one that we did on Thursday night?
3898447	3898948	Going home.
3900910	3903093	And isn't that always the best part of Orange Lounge Radio?
3903374	3904175	Is turning it off.
3906398	3907239	Just kidding, Jesus.
3908341	3908601	Alright.
3908621	3910784	You don't even have to go home, we're already here.
3911966	3915471	Hey, that's gonna begin my fuck you week, by the way.
3933140	3940723	Okay, the first part of the week goes towards driving all the way out here and using up my gas.
3941864	3944625	And you live way the hell out of the way.
3946425	3948846	I couldn't just turn like this.
3949086	3950567	I could've been near my house.
3952361	3959266	It's just, I mean, no offense to Zero, but I'm glad that I didn't have an episode on it.
3959306	3961347	Drive from full speed to South Park.
3962348	3962908	Oh, man.
3963249	3967451	Actually, no, I would have been happy to do it, but I think this isn't what I did.
3967892	3971774	My other 5K of the Week goes towards... Why'd you put my book down there?
3972195	3974756	Or I would never be able to find it.
3975257	3977238	Okay, someone put my book on the floor.
3977258	3978239	5K's never put my book on the floor.
3978259	3978779	Wasn't me.
3978799	3979760	I didn't touch your book.
3983378	3983919	I didn't do it.
3986601	3988283	What's that mean?
3988303	3991245	Check that book for prints, because I haven't touched it.
3992606	3999553	Mike Yu goes to A1 Comics Distributor for being sold out of the Battle Royale novel, and I had a gift certificate to get it from him.
4000694	4003956	And so I had to go and actually pay for the book in a bookstore.
4005458	4008100	And then it looks like he goes to these old people who were tailgating me.
4009637	4012478	So I decided to start going five miles an hour.
4014118	4018919	And then I sped up and decided to take another lane.
4021019	4023800	I can't really think of anything else because I'm really happy because I'm working now.
4023820	4028521	So I could go through my sleep schedule for not resetting yet.
4028681	4030241	Because I didn't know this would be a lot.
4032021	4032822	I think that's about it.
4033602	4034222	What are you doing?
4034242	4035022	Drugs.
4038717	4040657	So fucking what?
4040777	4042718	Cry me a goddamn river.
4043198	4043838	Fuck y'all.
4046519	4047379	Okay, not you.
4047739	4048739	But fuck everybody else.
4049459	4051200	Alright, let me start.
4054600	4058521	But... Oh, I'm sorry, were you not done?
4058601	4059161	I guess I am.
4059441	4061722	I'm sorry I wasn't meeting you, I meant everyone else.
4064375	4068999	Oh yeah, I have a fucking leak, but I think that she's going to address that, so I won't say anything about it.
4070921	4076026	I was going to say, if you can't hear us, there's this little knob on the side of your speakers.
4076046	4077327	It's called volume.
4078128	4078829	Stay with me now.
4079249	4080010	Volume.
4080770	4081371	Turn it up.
4082492	4083373	Turn it talking louder.
4084195	4084495	That's it.
4084755	4089096	Okay, now my first review of the week is going to be going to stupid drivers, of course.
4089957	4098339	But this in particular is stupid drivers that don't know how to use the turn lane or the pull out lane or the suicide lane, whatever you want to call it.
4098359	4108142	It's that double yellow lane that's inside, you know, many sections of the road, you know, where you can pull in there, stop, and then turn out, you know, or turn out into traffic and that kind of thing.
4108866	4113089	People think that you're supposed to pace cars when you're in that lane.
4114070	4116511	No, because you're obviously not going to get out of that lane.
4116591	4119233	I'm not going to be able to get in that lane because you're going the same speed as I am.
4119253	4122776	You're supposed to pull out, stop, wait for traffic to clear, then go.
4123496	4124297	It's pretty simple.
4124697	4130000	But no, these dumb fucks out there, they don't understand that you're supposed to stop.
4131862	4132322	Stop?
4132522	4136445	How am I possibly going to get up the speed to make it into traffic?
4137526	4138026	Panic!
4138649	4140390	So, they suck.
4140410	4150012	Um, second FB of the week has to go to, um, Net Zero because they suck ass, and I'm glad I won't have to pay for them pretty soon.
4150652	4163256	But, um, yeah, they are now advertising that you can get, like, this stupid, uh, software-accelerated, uh, dial-up or something for five bucks a month more when their service sucks so much anyways, and why'd you have to pay an extra five bucks?
4165137	4166297	I hate them, but, you know what?
4167011	4168052	I've lived off them for a while.
4168753	4170234	Um, let's see what else is here.
4170595	4172997	Um, I have to do unpacking because it sucks.
4173097	4174779	I don't like packing or unpacking.
4175039	4176661	The whole moving process sucks.
4176761	4180825	I just wish I could get some paint and sleep in the other house in the morning.
4180865	4181746	Everything's unpacked.
4181786	4183548	But that just doesn't ever happen.
4185010	4186912	And, um, let's see, what else?
4189748	4208319	FD to Mashabi Builders of Apartments, because this apartment for some reason has everything cheaply made, like the shower curtain kind of falls off the wall, let's see here, the drawers fall out of the drawers, the gas on the stove sometimes doesn't turn off, which is kind of dangerous.
4208879	4213022	Yeah, it's stuff like that, you know, you would just normally not think about.
4213042	4215043	So yeah, FD to that, and...
4217716	4221778	I don't really have that much more, you know, I was more angsty earlier in the week.
4222178	4225820	Mostly it's stupid people because stupid people cause all the problems in the world.
4225860	4229782	Stupid people don't look for where they're driving because they always try to hit me.
4229862	4231823	And just really dumb people out there.
4233483	4233824	That's it.
4233984	4234624	Oh, and, um...
4236156	4242238	FU to Jose, our cable installation guy.
4243158	4245279	You're a fucking dumbass sitting here at the time.
4245379	4248560	I wasted a whole fucking day waiting for your ass and you were still two hours late.
4248920	4254821	Let me kiss my ass, you bastard, thinking you're going out of all your way just to fucking set up a cable box.
4255101	4257302	Which, by looking at it, I could have probably done myself.
4258102	4261383	You know, and I have to pay you $25 for you to be two hours late.
4261403	4263924	You should fucking have to pay me instead of this piece of shit up here.
4264933	4265494	Alright, I'm done
4291656	4301770	I have a few FUs I'd like to give out this week which is interesting because I'm not usually this angsty but I'd like to give a big FU to whoever filed the noise complaint against Loki and I like our third night in the apartment
4304068	4309492	If you think that was loud, you haven't heard anything yet.
4309872	4312214	That really sucked, because we weren't even that loud.
4312234	4317878	We were just playing Max 2, like, kind of loud, and Loki was playing some of his new remixes at a medium volume.
4319139	4320540	And somebody didn't like that, apparently.
4321280	4322201	Well, poopy on you.
4323202	4325964	Buy some earmuffs.
4326504	4331828	My next hot cue of the week goes to the big poles that hold up the covered parking lot.
4332975	4337037	because one of them took off my side mirror while I was backing out yesterday.
4339559	4339879	Oops.
4341560	4342620	It jumped out of nowhere.
4344722	4353686	And F you to car insurance companies because you charge too much and you rip me off and you charge me deductibles and I hate you.
4354047	4354427	That's it.
4355809	4357230	I just don't like car insurance, that's it.
4358751	4360411	I guess that's it, I'm all out of angst now.
4360631	4362032	Does Bradley have anything you'd like to share?
4362052	4363593	Sure.
4365094	4365874	Go for it, Bradley.
4365974	4371657	Fuck you to general lethargy and laziness on my part.
4371737	4373618	Still haven't found a job yet.
4373958	4374738	I'm lazy as shit.
4374798	4379060	Fuck you to body parts that hurt sometimes, like back and feet.
4379241	4382402	Fuck you to body parts that hurt sometimes, like back and feet.
4384932	4390696	So, not that you've been alright this week, backstarter, but probably because I sat around in the chair for too long watching stuff.
4391797	4406767	And then, uh, fuck you to peer resets on WinMX, when trying to download something from maybe a Japanese person, it times out or peer resets, and you can't ever find that user ever again, and this is where I probably can't find them, usually.
4407188	4413252	Fuck you that, when it was 98, I can't use Japanese, certain Japanese, that's just, I didn't need to upgrade, so, yeah.
4415700	4416500	Well, not in 1.98.
4416701	4418461	With WinMX, though.
4418501	4422944	Because it's Unicode and you can't do that in 1.98.
4423444	4424925	But I don't even know if it's in 1.98.
4425025	4425885	That should happen soon.
4427766	4430548	Well, I'll figure it out someday.
4431288	4433369	And the fucking people don't share.
4433389	4433369	1.98.
4433409	4433669	Sure, sure.
4440037	4440977	I'm like one of those people.
4441257	4444059	You know, I'm downloading something and I'm like, oh, you're trying to download it too?
4444179	4446199	Cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel.
4447020	4447740	I love doing that.
4448180	4451842	But, um, no, F you to Catherine Zeta-Jones because you fucking suck.
4451862	4457464	You're a fat pig and you're pregnant and you're smoking and then you're bitching about people taking pictures of you smoking pregnant.
4458084	4461985	And then you're, like, suing companies because they have nude photos of you standing on your balcony pregnant.
4462746	4467127	Uh, well, first off, don't go out in public pregnant because we don't want to see you naked to begin with.
4467427	4468348	And number two, you're smoking.
4469807	4478110	About the file sharing thing, if I don't see people that download for me, I just create a folder with nothing in it for them to download out of.
4478130	4480310	They can download AIR!
4491494	4496900	All you need to do is create a giant text file and name it like, you know, Matrix Reloaded dot AVI.
4500423	4501585	Haha, fooled you.
4503066	4503727	You a bitch.
4507190	4512534	I've decided, though, on Ragnarok Online, though, this is going to be getting such good reviews.
4512634	4517638	There's people out there going, you know, $10,000 money for cyber theft.
4518278	4522862	So I'm going to do that, and then after they pay me, my request is going to be, okay, you're fucked, so leave.
4525662	4527963	You know what I think I want to do with the file sharing thing?
4528403	4535707	I want to put up files that say Matrix Reloaded, X-Men 2, and all this stuff, and have them be episodes if you can't do that on television.
4536207	4539029	Because that shows the shit, and everybody should be watching those and not movies.
4540265	4547448	I was saying earlier that we should have a channel that plays old school Nickelodeon shows, like Salute Your Shorts, Hey Dude.
4547468	4558873	They have, I think we have it on digital cable too, it's Nick Gas, Nickelodeon Games and Sports, and it shows like Guts, and Wild and Crazy Kids, and all these old school Nickelodeon shows.
4559633	4561254	Yeah, I think it shows old school Double Dares too.
4561914	4564015	We have to look on the digital cable line and see if we have it.
4565215	4566076	That station is cool.
4566216	4567696	Let's get to the chatroom FUs, shall we?
4568216	4569277	Because they're getting angsty.
4572116	4584443	Muheimer would like to say, fuck trying to find a summer job, fuck Microsoft Calendar for not working, and now normally at this time of the year I would say fuck allergies, but the acupuncture therapy I'm doing has relieved all YM pollen allergies.
4584663	4585303	You know what sucks?
4585443	4592347	Is I'm allergic to everything, I'm allergic to dust, molds, and pollen, and I'm afraid of needles, so I'm screwed.
4594008	4596149	And Muheimer says, I suppose that's all then.
4596470	4598731	Oh, but fuck me for being so untanned and white.
4601863	4603823	You know what, I sympathize with you on that one.
4607284	4608705	Oh, John Fields makes a good point.
4608745	4611965	If you want to see old episodes of Pete and Pete, you can see those on Noggin.
4612806	4613866	That's a cool station, too.
4613926	4615626	Noggin has the old episodes of Square One.
4616006	4616686	That's awesome.
4617947	4620667	Square One was the best show ever, like on PBS.
4621087	4621868	It was MathNet.
4621888	4622648	You remember MathNet?
4623708	4626149	Yeah.
4626689	4627769	They showed that in your classroom, Jamie?
4627789	4627889	Yeah.
4630163	4633085	Square One would be piped into the classrooms every day.
4633105	4634246	It was like a national thing.
4634546	4641070	You subscribed to the Square One channel, and they would play them during the homeroom of your classroom day.
4641090	4642691	You'd watch Square One during the homeroom.
4642711	4644852	Actually, I could do it in my homeroom, but it would be on.
4648260	4648860	That's cool.
4649321	4651041	Okay, let's move on with some more FU, shall we?
4651362	4659786	Okay, um... Justin would like to say that this really isn't an FU, but it's funny, okay?
4660146	4664008	We're getting our roof redone, and I get home and went on my computer with my headphones on.
4664368	4667390	Later, I walk out into the living room, and there's a hole in the ceiling.
4667810	4669671	One of the guys fell because the board broke.
4670492	4674734	Well, FU to him, actually, because I had to clean today, and I had to get rid of the insulation out of the boxes today.
4676233	4684135	Oh, and F you to myself and Loki moving because now I don't live five minutes away from Justin B. Sorry.
4691249	4699758	Alright, John Fields would like to say F you to teachers that give you six essays to do over one weekend when it's the end of the semester and it's time to study for finals.
4700579	4708527	F you to an old guy in a wheelchair who doesn't wait for a walk sign to appear to start crossing backwards so slowly in his wheelchair that I miss my light.
4708827	4709308	Billy!
4709548	4710108	Kill me!
4710609	4711430	Kill me, Billy!
4711790	4712111	Billy!
4715234	4716375	There is a guy that does that.
4716415	4718615	He has a cane and he doesn't even give a fuck.
4718635	4720216	He doesn't even wait for the thing to turn.
4720376	4724177	Because he knows he's not going to make it in time when the thing turns to walk.
4724538	4725258	So he just goes.
4725618	4726958	And, you know, the hell with traffic.
4727038	4729399	I hate crotchy people like that.
4729499	4733921	Grandpa's trying to die and he's like, here's what it's like to be old.
4733941	4737142	And you're like listening to Sail Away and you lock him in a room.
4737322	4739123	It's like it's soothing, it's gorgeous.
4743263	4747906	DarkTetsuya would like to say a big fuck you to the little hacker wannabes that joined in on our Tetranet game.
4748206	4748727	It's sad.
4749047	4753790	Too bad you guys probably suck too fucking badly at Tetris that you have to use hacks like that in the first place.
4753850	4754771	It's a goddamn shame.
4755651	4756972	Tetranet is old school.
4757032	4758333	I was playing that years ago.
4762956	4764618	Look, I dropped a piece of the whole row.
4765458	4767400	Maybe they turned it into Prawn Triss or something.
4767600	4767920	I don't know.
4767940	4769201	They were probably using cheats.
4769622	4770963	No, triangle pieces.
4771183	4777428	An old-ass program like Tetranet is probably really easily hackable, so you can just instantly kill other people.
4777608	4779690	Why would you even hack Tetris?
4779730	4780211	Come on.
4780231	4782092	You've got to be fucking bored to be hacking Tetranet.
4782132	4782633	I'm sorry.
4782813	4785215	Why don't you, like, hack the government or something useful?
4790685	4794267	23rd Magus would like to say a continued FU to Kentucky for obvious reasons.
4794847	4798709	FU to being super ghetto broke, I can't even buy lunch, cold chicken is what I have to bring.
4799109	4800530	Glacial Bakwa, anyone?
4801130	4802131	That was a Bomani joke.
4803812	4805493	FU to hacker wannabes on Tetranet.
4805553	4807594	Lucky bastards can't even play Tetris.
4807874	4809515	Oh, little bastards can't even play Tetris.
4809555	4810255	Get a fucking clue.
4817745	4820166	DDR Angel would like to say that my F.U.
4820186	4822366	of the week goes to the County Supreme Court.
4823127	4823407	F.U.
4823487	4825107	for being called to jury duty.
4827148	4829448	It's my first one and I don't know what to expect.
4829488	4834530	Worse yet, I could have been working tomorrow and making more money than a dollar an hour doing jury duty.
4834930	4836210	Remember, no matter what, they're guilty.
4837331	4838211	Oh, and guess what?
4838791	4840772	DDR Angel has episode 42.
4842972	4844653	So maybe it won't be so lost after all.
4844693	4845733	We might be able to get that later.
4852361	4855945	Okay, Snub Dissanoid has a lot of them this week, so brace yourselves, ladies and gentlemen.
4856986	4860249	First off, to my Algebra 2 teacher, go suck an elephant's shitter.
4860609	4862651	To teach efficiently, follow these simple steps.
4863212	4864713	One, pull hairs out of asshole.
4864974	4866635	Two, teach the fucking course.
4866775	4870639	I think that because I finished my working class, I reserve the right to read a fucking book.
4870960	4876005	I don't see anywhere in the fucking handbook that states you get to throw out students that are done with work and reading books.
4876946	4877767	and I'll see you next time.
4907207	4922265	No, Kung Fu Finally, a big fat fucking shit eat my shit logs fuck you to Comcast for being fucking queefish little shit to change the cable channels I want to watch my fucking TV not wonder what the fucking channels are
4923354	4924936	Also, Fuck My Dex Drive.
4925656	4927518	Fuck My Dex Drive for not fucking working.
4927858	4928959	Fucking piece of shit.
4929299	4932002	I don't know it costed money to be pissed off these days.
4932082	4934164	Or I didn't know it costed money to be pissed off these days.
4934184	4934684	It could be worse.
4934724	4936626	You could have an MPX changer.
4937047	4938328	That thing's a piece of shit.
4939469	4942471	Another fucking novel courtesy of Snub Destroyed.
4943172	4946075	I was gonna say, um, here's another FU I had.
4946455	4947196	Tough.
4947776	4948257	Baiting.
4948797	4949598	Okay, it's gone.
4951326	4956114	and Maren would like to say a big thank you man to Hulk Hogan.
4956354	4958177	Hulk, you need to retire, brother.
4959039	4959479	P.S.
4959559	4960501	Give back my Kurti.
4962845	4963586	Why is he gone?
4966625	4979794	The first WWE thing that I see after years, or a year, is, first of all, Rowdy Roddy Piper needs to retire too, or needs to get back in the gym.
4980655	4981716	Okay, there's more.
4982516	4995665	But he brings out the newly sight unseen, iron contracted person, Mr. America, who comes out to Real American and does all the poses and it's Hulk Hogan in another persona.
4996806	4997807	And he can't be fired.
5000309	5002410	This is going to be retiring because he's fucking old.
5002430	5005512	Dude, they're going to tap him and he's going to break his arm.
5008140	5009701	Am I the only one that doesn't watch wrestling?
5010502	5011883	Well, I saw him retire.
5011943	5015325	I was flipping through channels and I was thinking, he retired, oh my god, he's gone.
5015345	5016506	I'm like, finally.
5016966	5019127	Well, he was cool back in the day, but now he's coming back.
5019167	5020809	It's like, go away.
5021369	5022190	Just die.
5022690	5023110	Die.
5023210	5029474	I'm sorry, but the coolest wrestler of all time is Andre the Giant, because he was in The Princess Bride, and that makes him cooler than anybody else.
5030795	5034578	Disagree with me, I dare you.
5036317	5038658	Okay.
5039958	5040959	Let's do a quick break.
5041059	5041659	No, let's not.
5041699	5042839	Let's just get into the cage match.
5042859	5043800	You guys want to do a cage match?
5044940	5047301	You want to do a break, come back, talk, and then do cage match now?
5047321	5048941	Yeah, I need to figure out which song I'm picking.
5049241	5049922	Okay, so you want to do a break.
5049942	5050542	We'll do a break then.
5050562	5051502	We'll do cage match a little later.
5052602	5054503	I am going to play a little song.
5056944	5059445	JB sent me a bunch of MP3s tonight of new Sci-Fam things.
5060405	5063068	Yeah, what was that one they wanted to play Max Resurrection?
5063088	5064049	Dude, that song's old.
5064229	5065330	They could play it on the show.
5065530	5071296	It's a decent remix of Max, but... Well, since it's been in demand so much, let's just play it.
5071536	5073198	We'll satisfy folks and play it.
5073718	5075741	Like Max Unity, that's pretty good.
5076201	5076862	Do I have it?
5076942	5078523	They said they sent it to me, but it's not... I have it.
5078964	5079404	I have it.
5079484	5079905	You have it?
5079985	5080866	Alright, you play it.
5081266	5081887	We can play it.
5082287	5083769	Alright, I'll start off with...
5085430	5088652	Let's see, I said I'd play one of these SyFam ones that JB sent me.
5089333	5093216	I don't want to play one that's super duper long.
5094537	5095397	Sorry about the noise.
5095777	5097158	It's me switching through folders.
5097519	5099220	Let's play... No folders.
5100181	5100801	Nope, nope.
5103103	5104003	Well, this one's not too bad.
5104043	5104504	We'll play this...
5105290	5106071	Well, that one's kind of long.
5106131	5109173	All these are really long that you sent me because they're all like extended mixes.
5110974	5112155	I can play stuff during the break.
5113636	5114956	I promised I'd play one of these.
5114996	5115817	Let's just do this.
5116337	5119519	It's another Judy Crystal song that's not in any DDR that I've seen yet.
5119620	5120860	It's called Boom Boom Boom.
5121301	5122041	And we'll play that.
5124243	5124883	Oh, I'm sorry.
5124943	5125844	This isn't SyFam.
5125864	5127105	This is LED Records.
5127545	5128145	My bad.
5128626	5128986	Sheesh.
5130501	5133363	You're the Sypham's whore, and all of a sudden now you're the LED whore.
5133403	5134344	How am I supposed to know?
5135004	5136225	I don't keep tabs on people.
5136545	5138407	Stop whoring yourself out to every record label.
5139427	5141609	Then maybe I can keep tabs on these things better.
5145051	5145592	Alright, I'm sorry.
5145652	5147073	Oh, Loki, you want to start with Max Redirection?
5147093	5149014	Alright, I'll play Max Redirection, and then we'll play... ... ... ... ...
5263211	5275108	Boom, boom, boom, dancing with the fire Boom, boom, boom, playin' with the shooby-dooba Boom, boom, boom, dancing with the fire Movin' to the rhythm, baby, take me higher Boom, boom, boom

5542114	5545240	Playin' with the shooby-dooba Boom, boom, boom, dancing with the fire

5625063	5625543	It's Strawberry.
5625564	5627105	If any of you guys want a popsicle, you can have one.
5627565	5629447	Oh, we have some new guests here in the house.
5629987	5630447	Say hello.
5630487	5633169	I know it's warm here because you have to have the windows closed.
5634010	5635792	It's getting hot in here.
5636792	5637413	Or in her.
5638073	5641096	Sorry, I thought I was supposed to say that.
5641116	5645459	Hi, this is LikeyStyle, fucking it up with Rice Princess over here.
5645659	5646260	Hello.
5647801	5648081	Is it on?
5648101	5648541	Yeah, it's on.
5648662	5649182	Okay, good.
5649342	5649602	Okay.
5650143	5651664	Yo, yo, yo, biznatches.
5653025	5653906	You've got soul.
5655310	5657351	Have you done anything interesting in Bomani this week?
5658751	5661192	Yes, I downloaded the Sampling Master CDs.
5661252	5664933	If you guys want to get some pictures of that, please let me know.
5665713	5666654	I'll take a few pictures.
5666894	5667534	Okay, cool.
5668014	5670355	And we could even put some of the stuff up on the Orange Lounge.
5670375	5672435	There's some good stuff in there.
5672796	5673456	We'll think about it.
5675637	5676877	I'm going to kill you.
5679178	5680298	Yes, Irene, you have a request.
5680998	5683039	I just want you to play the original telephone operator.
5684576	5686297	I don't think I have it.
5686357	5687258	I can play the edit.
5687578	5689859	That's about the best I can do for you right now.
5689919	5690179	Do you?
5690219	5692140	Yes, yes.
5692160	5692580	Later, later.
5692600	5693120	We'll get to it later.
5693440	5693900	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5704285	5706026	We have dead air right now because none of you have a mic.
5709147	5709647	I'm reading.
5711148	5714971	Everyone else has been so busy talking about stuff and the ficus were going on long, so I was like, I'll read.
5717353	5719234	There's 29 more students to go.
5724198	5724818	What do we have here?
5724838	5727160	The novel of Battle Royale.
5728321	5728761	Oh no.
5729882	5734866	Jamie's Battle Royale infatuation addiction has gone to a new level.
5735986	5737087	This is pretty interesting, though.
5737107	5738008	It's like red and black.
5739315	5741276	It's a very stylish book.
5741856	5742757	It's like school colors.
5743097	5743777	Yeah, there you go.
5744657	5746638	I think that's just the blood on their black outfits.
5749339	5750120	So, Bradley, what's up?
5750820	5751761	You've got the other mic.
5751781	5753961	I don't know.
5754742	5755062	How much?
5755482	5756643	I was listening earlier.
5757183	5759024	I was listening to Orange Lounge before I came here.
5759144	5760144	I was over at my apartment.
5760965	5764846	And as soon as you guys said, fuck yous, time for fuck yous of the week, I turned it off.
5765567	5765847	Okay.
5768510	5769190	Well, fuck you too.
5770591	5772653	A late F you to Brad for being a bitch.
5775414	5777136	The book was, Battle Royale was written in 1999.
5778556	5778797	Nice.
5779757	5783760	Okay, so we're going to be doing the cage match pretty soon here.
5787462	5788583	What do you want to bake a cake for?
5788603	5791925	I got one.
5793214	5794355	Yeah, boy, this is great.
5795415	5796956	Okay, are we just going to do the cage match then?
5797496	5798536	Alright, we'll go to the cage match.
5799057	5799857	Okay, three songs.
5800117	5801538	So, your song on the CD, yes, Jamie?
5801858	5802038	Okay.
5803378	5804479	Yes, we all have new songs.
5807300	5815764	Well, we're going to reset, because just of everything that happened with episode 42, and Loki admitting his song a couple weeks ago was crappy, taking it out.
5816204	5816344	Huh?
5816364	5816424	Huh?
5819281	5820821	My song was cool and now I can't use it again.
5820841	5821561	You can use it again.
5821862	5822122	Later.
5822242	5823702	Because that show is technically lost.
5823742	5824402	Later, maybe.
5824422	5824962	What song was that?
5825662	5826302	None of your business.
5827203	5827863	Fuck you, buddy.
5830143	5831204	I'll play it another week.
5831864	5835764	Alright, so if you were a fan of that song, it'll come back another week.
5835944	5836245	No worries.
5836265	5838105	That's a big surprise for those people who weren't paying attention.
5838125	5838665	Okay, so what?
5839005	5839505	Oh, yeah.
5839545	5841866	We're going to start with Loki.
5842346	5846527	Loki, explain your... Oh, well here, I have to do the whole little music and everything.
5846567	5847667	We have to make this official...
5848271	5848931	Off The Shield
5875869	5883451	And the winning song will go into rotation on Orange Lounge, Bomani Music & More, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station when we're not here.
5883971	5888412	So, each of the hosts picks a song to go in, and we start tonight with Loki.
5888532	5889492	Loki, tell us about your song.
5890192	5900815	My song I heard on a trance compilation CD a while back, and then of course since I've bought turntables, I bought the vinyl for it, so I have the actual clean edit for it.
5901435	5905840	This one is a song you might remember her from the song Sexual.
5906240	5907101	She sang a while back.
5907522	5909203	The way I feel is sexual.
5909223	5910264	I don't know if you've heard that song.
5910645	5913187	Anyways, this one's called Yes.
5913368	5916150	It's the HQ2 Big Room Club edit.
5916471	5918473	Because the full version is nine minutes long.
5918493	5920735	This one's pretty long as it is.
5921276	5923258	So, here we go.
6011435	6013656	I pushed up again
6060894	6062038	Thank you for watching!
6278010	6278810	Okie dokie!
6281351	6286732	Alrighty, that was Amber with Yes, and what was, was that some kind of remix, Loki?
6287592	6290233	It was the, um, HQ2 Big Room Club mix.
6291073	6292574	Alright, let's see what everyone thought of that.
6292594	6293334	Bradley?
6294454	6297055	I didn't hear all that much of it, but it sounded okay.
6297095	6298095	I gave it, like, 7.745.
6299475	6304056	Okay, and, um... What, what happened?
6305497	6306037	You're leaving?
6308971	6315376	Okay, um, what we're going to do right now is we're going to cut to Jamie's pick real fast.
6319660	6324644	Okay, um, I'm going to cut to Jamie's pick real fast.
6327026	6332330	And her pick, what we'll do is we'll come back at the end and tell what we thought of all these songs.
6333291	6337394	We're going to do, this is Jamie's pick, it's the Terminator 2 Techno Rave Mix.
6339591	6340302	and we'll be back.
6555817	6560448	Okay, that was Terminator 2, the Trance remix.
6560608	6565379	And that was Jamie's pick for tonight's Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.
6566383	6571484	Alright, so, we're going to go on to the third song and we'll come around and see what everyone thought of them when we're done.
6571904	6575605	Now, I always have to pick something crazy, so I certainly did tonight.
6576185	6581186	This is one of the old school vinyls that came in Loki's pack of 100 vinyls that he ordered.
6583647	6589748	And this is Raven Simone, who you might remember as the littlest girl on the Cosby show.
6591841	6595945	She did a song, and this song rules, and it's called That's What Little Girls Are Made Of.
6596366	6597607	So we're getting old school right here.
6597687	6599048	This is my cage match pick for tonight.
6599689	6602752	This is Raven Simone with That's What Little Girls Are Made Of.
6799653	6800834	I have to take a phone call.
6800854	6800974	Great.
6818211	6818791	How wonderful.
6820592	6823292	Loki, go around and give people's thoughts on all three of those songs, would you?
6823913	6824533	Okie dokie.
6824553	6826513	Ooh, I got the mic set to long.
6826713	6829214	Dude, this mic right here, you can broadcast anywhere in the house.
6829234	6830895	What'd you think of the songs?
6830915	6833215	First one was mine.
6835856	6836316	Um, here.
6839017	6839897	They all seemed pretty good.
6840617	6842318	I just didn't hear them all that well.
6842738	6846739	I remember when the Raven-Symoné one came out, they showed it at the end of Kazuko, I think.
6847839	6850103	Dude, he's playing tug-of-war with a cow.
6850303	6851645	Dude, check this out.
6852045	6855130	Check this out, man.
6855170	6856772	He's playing tug-of-war with a cow.
6858054	6859356	It's like the greatest show ever.
6864815	6869378	If you've got TNN at home right now, turn it to Most Extreme Elimination Challenge.
6869559	6872060	I tell ya, man, it's the most kick-ass show ever.
6872401	6874602	They are playing tug-of-war right now with a bunch of different things.
6874782	6875223	Watch this guy.
6875243	6876584	Hey, wait, you're not talking about Cage Match.
6876784	6878285	He's gonna get screwed right now.
6878385	6879646	Watch this, this is so wrong.
6880527	6886571	Because the other guy had a... So they don't tell them what they're gonna pull against?
6886991	6891595	They run down the line of ropes there, and they have to pick a random rope, and each rope's attached to something different.
6893805	6899637	And this one, the last one, the little girl, the girl gets to tug a war against some idol.
6900639	6902503	So, what did we think of those three songs?
6903994	6923403	Yes was cool, um, because I picked it, nah, it was alright, I don't know, it sounded better on the CD, because it probably was shorter on the CD, um, the Terminator 2 one sucked, I, no, at first I thought it was going to be, uh, there's another song called Turn Up the Blaster or something like that, some Scooter song sounds like the Terminator 2 thing, I thought that was what it was going to be at first.
6923843	6927024	That was a good cigarette out there Sorry, I wasn't in here to hear it, so ask somebody else
6952637	6956561	The first one was okay, I couldn't really hear it, but it was okay.
6957081	6962486	The second one, I don't know how, I guess I didn't hear how it sounded anything like Terminator, but whatever.
6963307	6964008	It was okay, too.
6964848	6969393	The third one was, like, really silly that you picked it, Rob.
6969733	6969953	Yeah.
6970554	6970934	Of course.
6971835	6972495	But it was okay.
6972916	6973737	I'll say what I thought.
6973777	6975718	The Amber song, I've heard better from Amber.
6975738	6977080	That one was a little too weird.
6977100	6978321	It was too diva-ish for me.
6980089	6981290	I've got some more, too.
6981851	6985814	See, that wasn't the one I wanted to pick this week.
6985874	6993520	It was actually the one I wanted to pick was... I don't remember the title, but I have another one called The Need to Be Naked.
6994821	6996122	Ah, I think I've heard that song before.
6999485	7001006	And the second song was okay.
7001266	7002247	It was all right.
7005181	7034202	and then the third song was awesome of course because it was old school so you can send in those votes now to me, I'm Sky, I'm in the chat room and once we have a winner we'll let you know and that song will go into rotation on Orange Lounge Radio we're going to go to break because there's a lot of chaos going around in the studio right now so we need to take a quick break and hope you bear with us and we will be back very soon
7039372	7052275	Do it all night, do it with me, I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free, babe Do it tonight, do it alright, just take me and shake me till I burn up inside, oh
7074853	7078902	With handsome friends and chicken can But you're gonna feel so free when you do
7226618	7227785	Thanks for watching!
7357216	7360479	Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.
7361179	7362720	Orange Lounge Radio.
7364441	7366383	Hello, we are back.
7367244	7369585	And sorry about that, we had to give you a lot of music there.
7369705	7372467	Just a lot of stuff going on in the studio right now.
7372487	7375750	Some folks are watching the, what, Extreme Challenge thing going on?
7377729	7379551	Most extreme elimination challenge.
7379571	7380772	The most extreme.
7381632	7382393	Yeah, best show ever.
7383174	7385996	And unfortunately, Jamie got a phone call and had to leave.
7386356	7387437	And we don't know much about that.
7388218	7389178	Last minute FU of the week.
7389258	7390720	I remember this because this was last night.
7391060	7393021	Last night I watched The Price is Right.
7393201	7397925	They had this million dollar special where they were giving out prizes that were just like thousands and thousands of dollars.
7398886	7401228	One of the prizes that they had...
7402307	7402447	No.
7402787	7403728	Well, it's close.
7403868	7404408	It's Pump It Up.
7405048	7405348	Whoa!
7405368	7405568	Holy crap!
7405588	7410830	They had a Pump It Up machine that they were giving away as a prize, and the lady didn't win it because she's a dumbass.
7410850	7413131	I was like, fuckers!
7413911	7416232	I would, yeah, she wouldn't appreciate it.
7417513	7424675	Yeah, but seriously, the prizes, okay, the prizes you normally, like a normal showcase would be like $20,000, $30,000 maybe, like every now and then.
7425136	7427196	This was like, the one showcase was $101,000.
7429315	7432641	Wow, I would have been on there and fucking ruled.
7432681	7440696	The guy won a trip to England, he won a new car and a boat, and then there was some other thing that he won that was like...
7441107	7442588	They should have had a 2DX machine on there.
7442628	7443328	I would have wanted it.
7443388	7448850	No, but they had a pump-it-up machine, they had some NHL game, and then they had something else.
7448990	7449690	I forget what else.
7449770	7454552	I would have gone on Pressure 8 if I knew, because they don't usually give away video games and stuff.
7454572	7455532	Well, this is a special.
7455752	7456492	A tea set!
7456592	7460074	And you know how normally if they win... A fondue plate dish or something.
7460134	7461954	Was it that stupid wheel that they spin?
7462094	7465376	How you land on $10,000 and you normally get $10,000?
7465416	7465916	Yeah.
7466376	7468257	Well, because this was the special million dollar show.
7468277	7468657	It was $10,000 and $100,000?
7469628	7471129	No, it was 1,000 and a million.
7472029	7472449	What?
7473290	7473730	What?
7474730	7477891	But your odds of getting that are pretty... Unless you cheat.
7479972	7480633	That's cool.
7480853	7482994	I remember the time I went to see The Price is Right.
7483014	7483834	It was so wonderful.
7483974	7484414	I want to go.
7484434	7485835	I want to go back so bad.
7485915	7492678	I know I get... I do get nostalgic when I think about The Price is Right, because it was so wonderful, and I had a great time.
7493178	7495079	Bob... Bob... Oh, man.
7495119	7498380	Bob Barker and his fake and bake is a rice princess that we're...
7498840	7515807	He's got like the fakest tan, he's always like It's not really that he has a fake tan, his makeup is orange, he looks orange in person Yeah, on the TV he doesn't look so orange, but what I've heard is when you go there to the studio, he's like, he's a fucking tangerine, dude You ever wonder what happened to the Oompa Loompas when they grew up?
7517088	7526692	Bob Barker Seriously No, dude, Bob Barker's my hero, he's like 90 years old or something and he's got Poon Annie running around his studio like nothing and they want him
7528325	7535024	Now, if you had to put Bob Barker versus Hugh Hefner in a fight, didn't you see Happy Gilmore?
7536067	7537687	The Price is Wrong, bitch.
7538728	7539808	Wait, that was Adam Sandler's line.
7540028	7542669	Anyway, still, Bob Barker kicks some ass in that fight.
7543309	7544529	Best fight scene ever in Hollywood.
7544689	7545390	What do you think, Rob?
7545490	7557633	I remember that when we went and saw The Price is Right being filmed live, they can do little question and answers sections between, like, when there's commercial breaks usually, Bob Barker's doing, like, this little question and answer thing.
7557653	7559974	And somebody asked about, like, will there ever be a Happy Gilmore 2?
7560014	7560094	No.
7562048	7563409	He's not the one producing the movie.
7563449	7564050	How would he know?
7564690	7565030	I don't know.
7565231	7566111	Or has he been asked?
7566231	7567452	I don't remember what the exact question was.
7567472	7568073	That's funny, though.
7568453	7572156	Anyway, let's reveal tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.
7572296	7573477	And it's quite a shocker.
7575699	7581964	By only one vote... By only one vote, the winning song was...
7589403	7593827	That's right, it was Raven-Symoné with That's What Little Girls Are Made Of was tonight's cage match winner.
7593847	7595228	That's the track.
7595989	7596829	That's the joint.
7597530	7598211	That's the cut.
7598691	7599872	And all those ghetto slang.
7600733	7602254	And it won by a whopping one vote.
7603415	7604356	How many people voted?
7604576	7605317	Or can you say on there?
7605337	7605637	A handful.
7605917	7606378	A handful.
7606518	7607358	Okay.
7607439	7611302	Not as many as usual, but not the least I've ever seen vote in a cage match.
7611942	7614505	But I think there were a lot of people like, I ain't voting for any of that shit.
7616506	7617947	For any of it, yeah.
7617967	7621770	Basically like the real presidential polls nowadays, you know?
7622030	7625893	I actually had to think about it for a minute because people were voting yes.
7626093	7627555	I'm like, what do you mean you vote yes?
7628275	7629736	Oh, yeah, we had a song called Yes.
7629976	7634620	You don't vote yes or no on a... You don't vote yes or no on the cage match, you stupid punks.
7635200	7636201	I'm still playing at baseball.
7636221	7636762	We did have a yes.
7637562	7638423	Oh, okay, sorry.
7638843	7644525	Okay, so as I mentioned a second ago, you might have missed it because we were talking about Cage Match, Jamie left.
7645346	7651548	She had another situation she had to take care of, so she's left the building, but we've got plenty of guests still here.
7651628	7652509	We have Brad and Irene.
7652949	7657171	The Ice Queen walked in at some point during the Cage Match in the corner.
7658631	7664714	Anita and Dark Child are on their way, and they keep calling me from different places going, I can't find it.
7664734	7667095	We're in Mexico, and we can't find your place.
7668186	7670848	Well, it's hard to drive when you're getting pleasured in the car.
7671829	7674311	Oh, wow.
7675412	7680817	Anyway, so, but we thought we'd use this opportunity since we're really low on ideas and material.
7681758	7685881	Irene had something she wanted to do for a while now.
7687242	7690745	But you're going to have to explain this because even I don't know how this works.
7690845	7693928	But, oh wait, we have to have theme music.
7694328	7694568	Okay.
7694889	7696250	Sorry, we have to have theme music for this.
7696270	7696490	That's fine.
7698956	7701237	Give me a minute here because we have to have theme music for this.
7701977	7703518	It's going to be a segment.
7704098	7705539	Irene, what is this segment called?
7705959	7710021	Well, I introduced it a couple weeks ago into the chat room, an idea.
7710141	7711501	It's called Orange Crush.
7712001	7712502	That's right.
7712562	7714903	It's time for Orange Crush.
7716243	7717864	Yeah, I hope not.
7718824	7719825	Orange Crush.
7720385	7721865	Orange Crush.
7722025	7723006	Orange Crush.
7723066	7724727	It's time for Orange Crush.
7724907	7726307	Go kick your ass.
7726427	7726767	Okay.
7727068	7728088	How does Orange Crush work?
7728484	7732365	Okay, well, it was kind of a, I don't know, basic idea.
7732385	7739907	I don't, nothing's finalized, but we could basically take two people from the studio and we're going to ask them questions, the same set of questions.
7740027	7746108	One person, I guess, can just leave while we ask one person and then they can come back and then the other person can leave and blah, blah, blah, blah.
7746508	7747909	So, yeah, and it's timed.
7747949	7749929	You know, you have 30 seconds to answer five questions.
7750329	7750469	Oh, okay.
7750509	7752730	Which really shouldn't take too long or anything.
7752750	7753670	So it's a trivia game.
7754170	7754870	Yeah, pretty much.
7755010	7755210	Wow.
7755230	7756711	And there's a theme to each one.
7756811	7757191	Oh, okay.
7757211	7757291	Okay.
7757991	7760752	So, someone's knocking on the door and that's really scary.
7761852	7762752	Did someone drop a spoon?
7763052	7764533	Maybe we have somebody else who wants to compete.
7765693	7766453	Come in, come in, come in.
7766713	7767113	Get him in here.
7767674	7768074	Who is it?
7768994	7769414	Shite.
7770734	7771935	He has your shirt on!
7772595	7773295	Come in, come in, come in.
7773315	7774455	Brad, he has your shirt on.
7775455	7776036	Look at his shirt.
7776056	7777016	Brad has that shirt.
7778436	7778976	Isn't that funny?
7779477	7782317	Hi, welcome to Dark Child and Anita who finally found the place.
7783017	7783518	How you doing?
7783558	7785178	How big is the clock tower supposed to be?
7785198	7785398	I'm okay.
7786838	7788019	Clock Tower Storage.
7789920	7792702	I need a rope clock tower, so I'm looking for a clock tower.
7792742	7795263	We're about to do a segment called Orange Crush.
7795303	7796944	Now, we need two volunteers.
7800647	7804029	Okay, yeah.
7807111	7810273	Okay, so who's going to compete in Orange Crush?
7810293	7813835	Okay, I need two volunteers from the studio who wants to do Orange Crush.
7814497	7815378	Just raise your hand.
7815658	7816800	Bradley will be one.
7818682	7821746	And, oh, you or Matt, whoever.
7824609	7827132	Okay, it'll be Dark Child, I guess.
7828502	7828822	I don't know.
7829083	7831144	So, Dark Child and Bradley.
7831244	7833807	So, since Dark Child just got here, he can go first.
7833947	7838731	And, Brad, why don't you take Bradley outside and into the soundproof booth.
7839011	7839952	Now, we need a timer.
7840052	7840752	I don't have a timer.
7841873	7843034	Can someone count to 30?
7843795	7844175	Anybody?
7844496	7845256	Anybody in the audience?
7845837	7846617	What did I volunteer for?
7846637	7848559	Does somebody have a watch with a stopwatch?
7849059	7852883	It's a little segment that we... Oh, I can play 30 seconds of a song.
7852923	7853123	Yeah.
7853143	7853603	We'll do that.
7853763	7854024	Okay.
7854264	7855685	Can you explain Orange Crush to me?
7855785	7856746	Because I'm a noob still.
7857697	7859357	One more time for those who weren't paying attention.
7859397	7863298	It's basically a trivia game where we have 30 seconds.
7863338	7865318	We ask you five questions, however many you get right.
7865338	7868399	You're competing against Bradley to answer more questions.
7869239	7870659	Oh, he needs a microphone.
7870919	7871600	He needs a microphone.
7871620	7871860	Hold on.
7872360	7873300	Let's get him wired up here.
7874900	7876040	You have more than two microphones now?
7876060	7876601	Pretty much, yeah.
7876821	7878561	Yeah, the end of when Ben signs money.
7879041	7881841	Hey, Loki, I must say, nice collection of DVDs over here.
7883762	7884442	I have more on tape.
7887076	7890879	Porno, porno, porno, anime, porn, porn, porn, porn, porn, anime.
7891579	7894642	Okay, so you can... Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.
7897464	7901827	Okay, the theme of this one is called Love Me Do.
7903188	7903988	Here and now?
7904028	7904229	Yeah.
7904589	7908071	Okay, so can we... Oh, he has to cue up the music.
7908131	7912695	Okay, so basically what you're expecting is questions about Akira Yamaoka.
7914116	7914737	I've fucked.
7915037	7915537	Yeah, I know.
7915837	7918059	Okay, ready to start the clock and go.

8045367	8048168	Uh-oh, okay, you both got none of them right.
8048528	8050189	Um, there was five questions.
8050309	8051509	Okay, what, okay.

8062232	8062873	I'm Hispanic.
8064631	8068492	I think I know the last two for sure, but I don't know about the other ones.
8068512	8069392	What year was he born?
8069953	8073674	I would say he's probably in his 20s, which would mean he was probably born in 73.
8074774	8075094	What was it?
8075114	8075974	He was born in 1967.
8078115	8078635	One year off.
8079015	8082096	Okay, what city was he born in?
8082576	8084217	I would just go generic and say Tokyo.
8084277	8084917	Yes, you're right.
8086277	8087418	What is his favorite movie?
8088438	8089038	You know this.
8089648	8090449	You like the movie.
8090769	8091329	Lesbians.
8091969	8092530	Oh, Bound.
8092550	8093450	You told me that.
8093490	8094071	That's right.
8094151	8094471	Bound.
8094491	8096192	You know, Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon.
8097352	8098113	It's his favorite.
8099153	8100394	Bound is an awesome movie.
8100414	8100594	Huh?
8101975	8102195	Sure.
8103876	8107178	He's mimicking Bound.
8107198	8108439	What instrument does he play?
8108459	8109139	He plays the drums.
8109660	8110160	No, he doesn't.
8110460	8111741	He plays the guitar.
8112621	8113822	We confirmed that the guitarist.
8115843	8117364	Oh, but okay, but the last one.
8117544	8119166	Last one is what video does he appear in?
8119206	8120127	Dancer, I knew that.
8120227	8120407	Yeah.
8120587	8122489	But somebody told me he played the drums in Dancer.
8123410	8123911	Who lied?
8125592	8125693	Oh.
8125893	8127655	You know who it is, the person that told you.
8132540	8135401	But his main instrument is the guitar.
8135501	8137221	Wait, but I thought he played the drums.
8138441	8139181	The skin flute.
8140002	8140382	Close.
8141142	8142142	Which guitarist is he?
8142182	8143722	Is he the one that's doing this thing?
8144362	8145543	Or is he the one wearing the skirt?
8145563	8146563	He's the other one.
8146643	8147403	He's the cool one.
8148963	8153724	Yeah, we can show you if you want to watch the video.
8153744	8154144	Not really.
8155285	8162126	So, yeah, that was an exciting piece of... Oh, okay, so... That was Orange Crush.
8165403	8169866	We hope you enjoyed Orange Crush, but it's over now.
8170187	8171568	Go and punch, Rob.
8171708	8175591	Yeah, I feel your tattoo right now.
8176091	8176492	Uh-oh.
8178113	8178893	It's skin tone.
8179254	8179694	Oh, no.
8179734	8181415	That's what the tattoo is.
8181435	8182076	Skin tone tattoo?
8182116	8183337	Does this make Anita hot and bothered?
8185018	8187140	Oh, Rob, you have such a sexy touch.
8188101	8191964	Am I the only one who notices that he doesn't have a tattoo there, and you're just rubbing his bare chest?
8193292	8205402	I don't know anything else to say Hi everyone So Dark Child and Anita, now that you're here, how was your guys' week?
8207984	8209906	Prior to coming here or after coming here?
8211287	8216291	Either, both We had a lot of time to fill, so both I don't know Whenever I came
8218625	8219906	It was pretty good.
8220307	8221207	Good week, I guess.
8222208	8223630	I'm still unemployed, which sucks.
8223790	8226152	Yeah, I guess it was a good week.
8226572	8227893	Was at the ranch this weekend.
8230475	8233037	Yeah, we were at Darkchild's mom's ranch.
8233358	8234499	We saw horsies.
8234859	8236020	We saw puppies.
8236320	8237461	I didn't get to ride yet.
8237561	8238142	I have a tan.
8239782	8241803	Oh yeah, that's from work actually.
8241923	8243884	I get to go out in the sun at work.
8244344	8246065	And I have like sandal tans on my feet.
8247006	8250107	So that's when I work out on the river and playing with fishies.
8250407	8251008	Yay!
8253199	8254139	I play with fishies!
8254700	8256020	I chop them into pieces!
8258100	8258961	But they're already dead.
8259561	8261021	I know, I should work at a sushi bar.
8261281	8262942	I'm going to bring you guys salmon this year.
8263082	8264202	I'm going to try.
8264242	8265963	If you like salmon, I'll bring salmon.
8266023	8268263	I like food, so any food is cool.
8269043	8270044	It'll be from the hatchery.
8270544	8271264	It's fresh salmon.
8271664	8272344	Very, very, very fresh.
8272364	8273985	It's not like mercury salmon, is it?
8274826	8280668	It's from the Feather River, so it's got... No, they're just coming up from the ocean, so they don't have a lot of mercury.
8280688	8282289	They're not like a thermometer, are they?
8282649	8283730	No, not at all.
8284210	8284850	They're ocean fish.
8284950	8285711	They're not from the bay.
8286351	8286891	Oh, right.
8286931	8291794	Yeah, they spend most of their life out in the ocean, so most of the food that they eat is mercury-free.
8292494	8293494	So they're predators.
8293715	8298317	The only predators that live in the San Francisco Bay that eat the...
8299037	8302299	Little creatures that are in the San Francisco Bay have a lot of work here, you know.
8302560	8305161	So, anyway, just, uh, that's a science note.
8305382	8306342	You're from Science Corner.
8306662	8307743	Anita's little Science Corner.
8307863	8309645	It's the science segment.
8310385	8312006	We do the science segment.
8312026	8312086	Yay!
8312126	8312486	Got it.
8312787	8313067	Uh-huh.
8314568	8319051	And, um, other than that, yeah, we had, we saw puppies and we saw horses, because they raise horses and puppies there.
8319431	8323454	Um, yeah, there's miniature Doberman Pinschers.
8323934	8327117	Minpins, Doberman Pinschers, and Toy Fox Terriers.
8328942	8329782	They were very cool.
8329962	8330682	They were so cute.
8330702	8331723	We saw little tiny babies.
8331743	8332843	They're like two weeks old.
8333763	8335824	So, aww, everybody.
8335844	8340205	Yeah, whatever.
8340825	8341465	Animals, whatever.
8341605	8342906	Yeah, it's old news for me.
8343046	8344226	Yeah.
8344306	8347427	Anybody have any exciting Bumanu news of our guests that just showed up?
8348027	8351648	I finally full comboed the Beauty of Silence.
8351928	8352428	Woo!
8352828	8353349	You go, boy.
8353369	8353549	Flight 7.
8353589	8353709	Woo!
8357343	8359706	I have no newpamani news.
8360366	8362108	I've barely played in the past couple weeks.
8363489	8364410	I'm nuttin' over the game.
8366051	8367212	All over the keys and everything.
8368854	8370235	And I play on the left side, Rob.
8370775	8371516	Just like you.
8371936	8373097	Yay, left side pride.
8374358	8375399	Left side represent.
8377181	8377661	Left side...
8379838	8382799	See, and we even have, like, gang signs.
8387501	8395385	As Loki puts his finger and thumb up to his forehead, and everybody's trying different hand signals.
8397746	8399867	Who else wants a hand signal that I can describe?
8401427	8406290	Okay, this guy is doing a very interesting little hand signal for the crotch.
8409751	8411632	Dark Child is licking his nipple.
8411672	8413953	Discussions on hand signals makes excellent radio, by the way.
8416974	8418094	Did you guys already talk about X2?
8418134	8418334	No.
8420315	8421115	Oh, it's so good.
8421255	8421355	X2.
8421395	8422876	Yeah, X2 News.
8422996	8424316	It's so good.
8425036	8425516	When what?
8425536	8427037	It's out already.
8427057	8427957	Of course, we don't spoil.
8427977	8429438	Spoiler-free review, please.
8429558	8430058	We never spoil.
8430078	8430958	It came out on Friday.
8433539	8434559	X-Men 2, the movie?
8434579	8435800	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
8435820	8436380	Hold on, Irene.
8437080	8438941	Irene's having a conversation with Matt, who doesn't have a mic.
8441934	8446900	Dark Child asked something that's not exactly a spoiler, but should I give this information out?
8446920	8447501	Does everybody agree?
8447561	8448142	What is the question?
8448162	8449604	He asked if Gambit is in the movie.
8450164	8451887	Gambit's scene was cut from the movie.
8452888	8453469	I agree.
8453749	8454350	Uh is right.
8455405	8457226	Shiesty Marvel pieces of shit!
8457286	8460828	It even says, it even... Sorry, we're being loud.
8461088	8467172	Okay, no, his scene, I was very pissed off, dude, because I was looking everywhere for it, and I didn't see him.
8468012	8474936	And it says Beast is in there, but I didn't see Beast, but somebody pointed out to me later on that he was in the form of, like, his normal human, because he uses...
8476607	8477488	No, no, no, no, no.
8477688	8479749	Beast wasn't in his human form, I don't think.
8479769	8483811	Not human form, but he has like an image thing that can make him look like a normal human, I think.
8484132	8484892	He was on the news.
8485092	8487154	He was on the news as Dr. McCoy or whatever, so.
8487614	8488795	Anyway, what to look out for?
8489175	8489655	Nightcrawler.
8490015	8490456	Excellent.
8490716	8492437	Nightcrawler's one of probably the best characters in the movie.
8492457	8492537	Yeah.
8492577	8494118	You'll see some great scenes with him.
8494158	8494718	Kick ass.
8495078	8498160	And it's more, it seems more adult.
8498180	8501362	There's a lot more violence, there's some swearing in it, so great stuff.
8501402	8502883	You guys should really run out and watch it.
8503444	8505465	And just hope that the power doesn't go out at the theater.
8506553	8508214	That was the FU of the week I forgot about.
8508314	8511375	Okay, I got to go to the movie theaters to go see X2.
8511455	8513176	We went to go see it over at Truxel.
8513196	8514277	It's right by Arco Arena.
8514457	8515517	That's something everybody knows about.
8516418	8520299	Right by Arco Arena, there's a huge movie theater, and we went to go see X2 over there, and it was great.
8520540	8533906	I mean, we bought the tickets off online, the online site where you can buy tickets, and we went, and we had to stand in this huge-ass line, and we were kind of towards the back waiting to get into the theater, but then one of the friends, a friend that I went to the theater with,
8534506	8540556	He has a friend that works at the theater So we got to cut to the front of the line We got to go to the VIP side So we were the first ones in the theater
8541272	8542853	So we got to go in and pick any seat we wanted.
8543193	8546354	So we sat right in the middle where you can put your feet up.
8546474	8548494	It's like right where the stadium seating part begins.
8548514	8549795	You can put your feet up on the bars and stuff.
8550095	8550555	We're sitting there.
8550575	8551215	We're getting excited.
8551235	8552036	The movie's about to start.
8552536	8555817	Five minutes before the movie starts, all the lights go out and the emergency lights come on.
8556157	8556637	We're sorry.
8556657	8557397	The power's out.
8558338	8559478	And how long was it out for?
8560658	8565840	Long enough so that they escorted us out of the theater and gave us tickets to see another movie at another time.
8566760	8568181	So what a waste of two hours.
8568741	8569781	Did you go back in and watch it?
8570322	8571022	No, we couldn't.
8571202	8571862	Oh, okay.
8572102	8574323	Okay, I thought when you... They closed theaters for the night.
8574583	8577624	You had called me earlier or later, and I thought you said that they started to move it up.
8577785	8578105	No, no.
8578345	8583067	The manager came in and was shooing us all out, so that really sucked.
8583487	8592030	Yeah, I have some friends that went to go see it that same day, but they were in the theater a little earlier, so they were halfway through the movie when the car went out.
8592050	8592090	Oh.
8594151	8596033	I was saying it's gotta really suck to be those guys.
8596053	8597333	That's why I was telling my friend that I went with.
8598114	8601236	Now, it sucks for us, but it really sucks for them.
8601316	8602977	Like when I went and saw Princess Mononoke.
8604298	8605119	Anyway.
8605619	8608341	Rob, you reminded me of one of my fuck you's I need to say for the week.
8609301	8610542	Fuck you to Bombay.
8611543	8615926	See, Bombay, he didn't get to go to see the premiere of it on Thursday.
8616431	8617352	I've got tickets for 545 opening day.
8639952	8640613	5.45 opening day.
8641113	8642474	I better get some tickets too so we can go.
8643215	8646076	Loki, Loki, I'm going to have premiere passes.
8647137	8647677	So what?
8647737	8648298	Do I care?
8648318	8649979	Are you sure you can get in with premiere passes?
8651140	8654342	Usually they don't let you use any kind of passes on brand new movies until two weeks.
8655402	8656643	Oh, okay, radio station premiere.
8659565	8661386	Oh, yeah, I guess premiere.
8661426	8662987	I want to see that movie so badly.
8663288	8664128	I know, everybody.
8664168	8665309	Counting down seconds.
8666380	8668341	That movie's gonna fuckin' make me piss my pants.
8669222	8670463	I'm gonna have to bring a new pair of shorts.
8671023	8672524	I'm gonna see that movie, like, eight times.
8673925	8677628	You're one of those weird people who's gonna dress up in, like, the black trench coat and the glasses.
8677848	8679209	I already own that, shut up.
8682091	8684413	I normally wear a trench coat, so... Shut up.
8684433	8685954	That's not a trench coat!
8686634	8687795	Trench coats go down to your ankle.
8689636	8692700	At least I don't have the glasses that don't have like the side arm thing.
8692720	8695103	They just stick onto your nose like Morpheus had.
8695743	8696925	Morpheus glasses are pimps.
8696965	8698807	Too bad they're $300 so I can't afford them.
8699468	8701671	Go get some knockoffs in Mexico or something, I'm sure.
8703035	8705236	Yo, look at me as the lens pops out.
8707617	8708458	Yo, yo.
8710399	8713660	Would you like to go deeper down the rabbit hole or whatever the fuck you said?
8714061	8714501	Cornhole?
8714641	8727327	I was reading some review on ain'titcoolnews.com where this guy just kept overusing the words fuck and cum and pissed myself like in his review of Matrix Reloaded because I guess it's been screened already at Cannes Film Festival and stuff.
8727428	8728968	Yeah, that's funny.
8730189	8731069	How mature.
8731089	8731970	I know.
8734045	8735246	It was probably one of the... Tee hee.
8735506	8736367	I said fuck.
8737008	8739370	It was probably, uh... What's his name?
8739390	8743614	The one of the... Ah, one of those... One of the guys died.
8743954	8744695	The two movie critics.
8745836	8746537	Siskel and Ebert.
8746677	8747398	Which one's still alive?
8747418	8748799	Yeah, Ebert and Roper.
8748819	8749660	No, now it's Ebert and Roper.
8749840	8750821	It was probably Ebert who did it.
8750861	8752342	He's all... Shit, fuck, come...
8754244	8755887	There's one thing I don't want to think about.
8756527	8757248	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
8757289	8759712	I'm at a river, at a pretty lake, pretty lake.
8766504	8770987	And he was too lazy to write up another review, so he just copied the one from the porn movie and used it for the Matrix.
8771047	8775111	Yeah, he posted a porn movie review and he thought, you know, because he didn't want to make up a Matrix review.
8775131	8776572	And that's why it said that.
8776852	8777913	It was probably a scat film.
8778193	8787581	And they just changed the names of the characters to, like, Neo and... When Neo took Morpheus from behind, it was the most excellent scene I ever saw in my life.
8788021	8789222	The anal Matrix.
8791284	8793105	Would you like to go deeper down the hole?
8795407	8796768	Let's see how far this hole takes you.
8797589	8797929	Whoa!
8800511	8801151	I know Kung Fu.
8802312	8803553	Eleventy billion dollars.
8804334	8804614	Okay.
8806735	8807196	Anyway.
8808997	8810598	So go see Mex- Ex- Mex- Whoa.
8810998	8811879	I know GHB.
8815931	8816811	X-Men 2 X-Men 2
8845222	8846222	No, this is the Clerks Animated.
8846242	8848062	No, Clerks Animated, another thing everybody should watch.
8849023	8853483	Regardless if you're fans of Kevin Smith or the Clerks or not, it's one of the greatest cartoons ever.
8853883	8857164	Proof that the greatest shows get kicked off TV all the time.
8858044	8858984	Like Family Guy.
8859004	8862425	Family Guy at least got more play than... Invader Zim.
8862445	8864325	Invader Zim got like a couple seasons too though, didn't it?
8864445	8872307	It got two seasons before John Vasquez pulled it off because Nickelodeon is trying to make it more kid-friendly.
8872587	8874407	Comedy Central is supposed to be picking up Clerks.
8875257	8883524	I'm sure they'll show the first six, but maybe, hopefully.
8884144	8886586	But Kevin Smith said there's no more Jay and Silent Bob in anything.
8888067	8891210	Well, that's a lie already, because they are doing a Clerks animated movie.
8892130	8894732	And so I'm sure Jay and Silent Bob have to be in that.
8894752	8899136	Well, the only reason they're doing no Jay and Silent Bob is because Jay's missing in action.
8899176	8899716	Jay, yeah.
8900437	8900577	Yeah.
8902273	8902773	What happened?
8903233	8904034	I don't know.
8904154	8904674	I don't think they know.
8904694	8907075	Did he turn tail and run out of the country, is what I heard?
8907415	8908515	Out of the country, he's dead.
8909296	8910016	He's not dead.
8910096	8914778	He's hiding on some island somewhere because of his convictions or whatever.
8915778	8917059	Conviction, that's not the right word, is it?
8917079	8917519	I don't know.
8918259	8922061	Didn't he talk about Jason Mewes being banished on an evening with Kevin Smith?
8922701	8923001	I don't know.
8923041	8927883	At Ghost Ward, he brought that up, and then Jason Mewes walks up on stage, and he knows where Jason is.
8930417	8934518	It's like one of the biggest conspiracies since like the whole Biggie, Notorious B.I.G.
8934558	8935498	and Tupac thing, you know?
8935958	8936878	Is he really dead?
8938779	8940779	I just think Jay ran off with Boo Boo Kitty Fuck.
8943019	8944600	Sorry, I don't know who Boo Boo Kitty Fuck is.
8947300	8949360	Anyway, I think he ran off with Strong Bad.
8951601	8958202	So, on another note... Rob's over here eating fucking pretzels.
8958242	8958782	Do your job.
8959665	8960145	What job?
8961886	8963387	Okay, we're going to go to a break real fast.
8964387	8965268	And then we're going to come back.
8968590	8972011	Well, I've been making my living with the kind of job we call blow.
8976293	8976954	Anyway, yes.
8979315	8979995	We go to break now.
8980596	8984858	And after break, we're going to come back with Ask Orange Lounge.
8985999	8989500	Where you can ask any of the members of Orange Lounge a question that you want.
8990460	8991860	Except Jamie, because she's not here right now.
8992180	8993561	But you can ask me, you can ask Loki.
8993901	8996501	You can ask RicePrincess or LankyStyle.
8996821	8998562	You can ask DarkChild or DDRholic.
8998602	8999602	You can ask Arcadian42.
9000082	9003043	Or you can ask the Ice Princess.
9004323	9005163	Oh, sorry, the Ice Queen.
9005543	9006843	I'm sorry, are you a princess or a queen?
9007823	9008304	He's a queen.
9008344	9014125	He's more of a queen than a... Well, then you're definitely a queen.
9016331	9018373	Vanessa May with Destiny
9045808	9046370	This is my destiny.
9077690	9078691	Thanks for watching!
9165827	9166833	Thanks for watching!
9199591	9200692	Thank you for watching!
9373039	9373906	Thank you for watching
9416775	9425339	Hiho, Kermit the Fog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.
9425459	9431461	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
9434283	9440145	Hello, we're back, and you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 43, and, um...
9444306	9445427	Hi Irene, how are you doing?
9445567	9446187	Hi, I'm pretty good.
9446227	9446708	How about you?
9446828	9447448	I'm pretty good.
9447468	9448369	I love your shirt.
9448649	9449209	Thank you.
9449670	9450790	Did you tell everyone about Rocky?
9451671	9452351	What about Rocky?
9452812	9456094	About Rocky, how it's going to be on May 10th at Davis.
9456114	9464780	Well, you have to remember we're an international show, but if anybody's local to Sacramento... It's going to be at the Campus Cinema at UC Davis, Chem Lab 194.
9465420	9467421	That's what it used to be, but now it's an actual theater.
9468542	9471244	Yeah, we're doing Rocky at midnight on Saturday, May 10th.
9472200	9473141	At the theater in Davis?
9473622	9479267	Well, actually, no, it's on the campus, but they changed the Chem Lab 194 to an actual theater.
9479527	9480448	Oh, okay.
9480488	9481529	What building is that?
9481749	9482149	Do you know?
9483290	9483690	You would know.
9487094	9489436	194, it's the big chem building.
9490697	9491537	Right by the chem building.
9491558	9492739	It's like really big.
9492799	9494240	It's like across from the silo.
9498862	9500202	It's where the soccer field is.
9500222	9502123	There were soccer people playing.
9503944	9505925	Student Union and the Taco Bell.
9506905	9507866	I never went to this.
9509247	9510367	Well, he would know or not.
9511088	9512588	Well, you know where the Student Union is.
9512708	9516330	You go basically... I can't remember the directions.
9516350	9518751	We can give directions later, but if you're interested, email someone.
9518771	9520752	If you go to vtour.ucdavis.edu, you can look on the map there.
9520772	9520972	Okay.
9526471	9529253	Okay, so as I said, it's time for Ask Orange Lounge.
9534796	9535676	Ask Orange Lounge.
9535696	9536016	No, I'm kidding.
9536036	9536837	I'm not going to sing this.
9536977	9537297	Okay.
9537597	9539438	Rob, you need to make new theme songs.
9539478	9539858	Yeah, I know.
9539978	9540839	All right, here we go.
9540859	9549904	First question is from Justin B., and he wants to know, will you play some of those cool songs I sent you, like Speed Over Beethoven, Living in America, Hungarian Dance No.
9549924	9551064	5, Mary Blonde, I Love You?
9551084	9551285	No.
9552930	9554751	Well, this is the problem.
9555131	9561114	While I want to honor that request and let everybody hear, because it's some rare stuff, it's some cool stuff.
9561154	9563095	It's not from SyFam, it's from LED Records.
9563135	9563975	I fucked that up earlier.
9564435	9570778	But the problem is, when I played that one a little while ago, half the chat room was like, you know, they were going into convulsions.
9570818	9572459	So I'm kind of at a tough space here.
9572819	9574100	So yes, we'll play them.
9575084	9578527	We'll intermix them with the other stuff, but we can't play them all in one big clump.
9581329	9584351	Loki says we can play them on February 30th.
9584711	9586052	No, we'll play some after the show.
9586072	9588434	We'll intermix it in with our typical Bomani music.
9588474	9588834	How's that?
9589014	9589815	We'll compromise.
9590475	9592757	Because there are some folks out there that like that stuff, which is cool.
9592797	9593417	I like some of it.
9593437	9595178	I don't like all of it, but I like some of it.
9595218	9597300	But there was some good sounding stuff in there.
9598203	9599503	So, we shall soon see.
9599523	9600043	Hey, Rob?
9600283	9600483	Yes?
9600964	9602004	I like kinky sex.
9602064	9606625	Are we going to compromise and allow me to have kinky sex on the show every now and then and mix that into the weekly programming?
9606825	9608005	Uh, we might be able to arrange that.
9608305	9609865	Yeah, we'll boost our ratings.
9609885	9609965	Okay.
9612026	9612806	Um, let's see.
9613006	9615466	This is a question probably Loki would be best to answer.
9615666	9616946	This one for Loki.
9617266	9625568	This is from SnubDisponoid, and he wants to know, Does the PSX dex drive not work with Windblow's XP, or does mine just hate me?
9626008	9628551	Yours just hates you because I have Windows XP and mine works fine.
9628852	9629572	Here's what I do, though.
9629632	9631715	I don't use the stupid program that it comes with.
9631775	9635139	I use a program called... Fuck, I can't remember the name.
9638246	9643468	Okay, I use a program called... Called... My screensaver's on and now my computer isn't responding.
9643708	9644208	Hold on.
9644708	9648970	It's called... PSX Game Edit.
9649830	9651331	Or, yeah, Game Edit.
9651371	9652631	PSX Game Edit.
9652731	9656293	And it's a nice little program that you can use for copying your edits and stuff.
9656313	9656793	It works fine.
9656933	9660054	I mean, trust me, this thing works on my freaking laptop.
9660134	9660874	It sucks ass.
9660934	9662275	Okay, it'll work on anything.
9662984	9668006	If it doesn't work on XP, do not use XP drivers that XP tells you will work.
9668426	9670486	Go to their website and download a driver off their site.
9670526	9671667	That might be the problem as well.
9674448	9675168	You have a question?
9675668	9677148	Oh, you can get through everyone else's question.
9677168	9677709	Well, go ahead.
9677749	9678109	Why not?
9678129	9679109	We'll get to theirs eventually.
9679309	9682730	My question is for you or Matt or Jamie, who's not here.
9683030	9683310	Okay.
9683390	9688252	Are you guys ever going to do the Covers in Classics show and or a request show?
9688843	9690444	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9712601	9714682	So what we do is we have season three.
9715183	9717964	One other thing I wanted to do on top of that is add some more music programming.
9718024	9723827	We have the long version lunches and late nights that are coming soon to the station, which have been coming soon for like three months.
9723867	9729770	But anyway, some other things I'd like to do is maybe have like a cover show, like a classic show, like an 80s.
9730110	9736574	Well, the thing is that I don't want to compete with anything that Under Station Live does because they're kind of the birthplace of this.
9736614	9738655	And they have an 80s show now on understationlive.org.
9739435	9741937	So it would be more of a classic show.
9742597	9744938	Not just 80s, but early 90s dance stuff.
9744958	9746239	And more dance songs.
9746339	9747460	Not gothy songs.
9747560	9750041	The songs that they covered in DDR.
9750061	9752002	It doesn't have to be strictly 80s.
9752302	9754244	Or like a request show, like I said.
9754504	9755624	I would like to see that happen.
9755664	9760427	And of course, the request shows are kind of already happening because we do have the live fuck-offs that go on on the station.
9760747	9761488	But they're not scheduled.
9761508	9762068	That's the only problem.
9762208	9765370	Yeah, I mean, like an actual 6.30 to 9.30 Sunday request.
9765470	9767611	It's possible, but it just depends.
9767631	9782020	The problem is, Loki, myself, DarkSakura, we dedicate a lot of time to the station as it is, and I think while we're willing to dedicate more, certainly it's kind of hard for us to sit there and go like, okay, I'm going to do it Tuesday at 6, you know, it's kind of hard to take away.
9782040	9787563	I mean, like an actual, on a Sunday, you know, like an actual official show for a request as opposed to a fuck-off.
9787583	9788243	Possibly, possibly.
9788343	9789524	Don't you have an intern?
9789984	9791025	Yeah, we do have an intern.
9791185	9792646	Yes, and certainly he can.
9793627	9795749	And we have other people that want to go live on our station too.
9795769	9802293	We just have to figure out how to work all that out fairly without taking away from the rest of Orange Lounge.
9802954	9806096	Not turning it into an egothon, I guess I should say.
9806397	9810880	Because then everybody, if one person, we let one audience member go live, then everybody's going to want to go live.
9810900	9817365	So we have to find a way to figure out how to do it fair while it still holds the high quality of Orange Lounge Radio and all that stuff.
9817465	9818446	So we'll figure it out.
9818866	9822030	I was just talking to Anita and I reminded myself of another fuck you I have to have, alright?
9822350	9823251	Alright, go for it.
9823271	9825254	This is fuck you to my parents, alright?
9826395	9827576	And my family for that matter.
9827957	9831020	You know, I've only known Anita for like three weeks.
9831100	9833403	Stop asking me, is she marriage material?
9833623	9834624	Is she going to have kids?
9834644	9835646	Does she want to have kids?
9836567	9837928	Those are good birthing hints.
9840663	9841343	That's another thing.
9841403	9844545	My ex keeps emailing me, and she keeps asking me the same question.
9844565	9845665	I said, are you going to marry Nellie?
9845685	9846466	Are you going to marry her?
9847246	9853789	Just because you broke up with me and got married, like, a couple weeks later, doesn't mean that I'm going to go out and get married right away.
9853869	9866035	Just because you're a freaking Jesus freak, okay, and have to be, like, have some commitment issues, and are living in Chico, you know, and your potential is a pet, what was it?
9866095	9867896	It's a veterinarian secretary.
9869837	9869997	Yeah.
9871758	9877002	Yeah, so that fuck you is for you mom and Eugene and you Aunt Mickey and you Uncle Zach.
9877243	9877903	Fuck all of you.
9878103	9881206	Happy Mother's Day from Orange Lounge Radio.
9883108	9883748	Alright, moving on.
9884128	9884969	Oh, you had another question, Irene?
9884989	9885129	No.
9885450	9885690	Alright.
9885810	9886430	I'm just taking the mic.
9887571	9888832	Let's move on then, shall we?
9889213	9889533	Okay.
9894207	9902730	Next question is, Dark Tetsuya would like to know, will you ever get around to adding more Vanessa May, speaking of which?
9903990	9910553	The only problem with adding more Vanessa May is that she hasn't really done anything else, Dance Mania, things like that.
9912294	9916718	Except for a really, really horrible track of Vanessa May, which I think appears on Dance Mania 7.
9917299	9923806	But even Dark Tetsuya, the complete Vanessa May whore agrees, that song is of the suck, and it will never be played again on Orange Ones Radio.
9925868	9930673	But we do have some random stuff that appears, so I don't see why we can't add one or two more Vanessa May songs, just because she rocks.
9931275	9938796	But I've got to find something more techno-y, upbeat, that fits into the groove of the rest of the station.
9939456	9943897	Something like, there's a song called White Bird that's remixed by Airscape, that's pretty good.
9944197	9945978	And Airscape is actually Bomani related too.
9946798	9948158	White Bird's pretty good, so I might add that.
9948918	9950778	But as far as like, it's got to be something dance-y.
9950798	9953919	If you have some dance-y Vanessa May songs, certainly send them, we'll think about adding them.
9954919	9959440	But there is some good, and she does have that Cotton Eye Joe, and that does relate to Bomani in a roundabout way, so...
9960385	9966631	But for the time being, I think it's just going to be a fuck-offs, and then we'll try to get at least one more Vanessa May track.
9966651	9969033	Because I know Fantasia's getting a little stale, but you know what you need to do?
9969253	9973157	You need to write Vanessa May and tell her to let herself appear on more Tanzania albums.
9973437	9977101	Or you could just say, oh wait, Vanessa May sucks, and I don't really give a shit about her.
9977261	9977921	Oh, shut up.
9978622	9981144	Or you could write her and tell her to stop making crap music.
9981905	9982786	You guys are awful.
9983226	9984347	Vanessa May's a piece of shit.
9984427	9985108	And guess what?
9985208	9985789	We just...
9986770	9987811	We just net split.
9988051	9989852	Our chat rooms are going through a net split right now.
9990373	9996077	So if you're on the other side of the net split, you guys can email your questions right now too.
9996137	9997778	I'll keep an eye on the email box, okay?
9998339	10003523	Email your questions to orangeloungeradio, that's all one word, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.
10003783	10011208	A net split is when the servers, one of the servers, like a chat room has like 10 different servers all funneling into the chat room.
10011549	10013210	That's when like half those servers break off.
10013670	10015270	Like, they stopped talking to each other.
10015310	10015630	They crashed.
10015650	10016631	Even one server can break off.
10016691	10016791	Yeah.
10016811	10018291	That's the link between a bunch of the servers.
10018311	10018671	Exactly.
10018931	10023232	And that causes a bunch of the other people to suddenly look like they quit, but they didn't quit.
10023352	10025252	They're still online, but they're on some other server.
10025272	10026912	So you lost the link between a bunch of those people.
10027352	10031093	And I'm sure people who are listening right now understand that already, but this is for people who didn't understand.
10031393	10031833	You never know.
10032253	10033013	In the... You never know.
10033353	10036154	We have some people who are new to our chatroom who may not understand the Nesplay.
10036174	10037454	We get new people on our chatroom every week.
10037474	10037934	Hello to you.
10038194	10042795	And if you want to join our chatroom, just head on over to Calibamonte.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on Chat.
10044346	10045729	That was a very nice segue Rob.
10045749	10046069	Thank you.
10059082	10064586	Well, anyways, my site, a couple things are going to happen.
10064686	10066667	First off, I need to actually do an update.
10069029	10077234	I also noticed that there's a few files missing on there that need to be on there because I was going through my stuff and there's a few things I forgot to move over in the appropriate folders and zip up and whatnot.
10077594	10081197	But anyways, another thing that's coming to my site is forums.
10081677	10085079	Yes, I actually purchased forums and I will have forums soon.
10085199	10087801	I just have to scan them and then we're ready to go.
10088041	10089202	Has to give him some clothes.
10089862	10090103	Yes.
10090503	10090783	All right.
10092845	10097828	Good question coming to us from AkumaGM, who is getting us to talk about some Bomani.
10098849	10103772	Will the release of DDRXbox produce some enjoyable, downloadable content?
10104853	10105714	Interesting question.
10105914	10106715	Loki says yes.
10107595	10109457	I didn't know there was going to be a DDRXbox.
10109477	10111298	You need to listen to this show more often, Brad.
10111398	10111858	Fuck you.
10111938	10112499	What is this show?
10113857	10114638	Content, yes.
10114718	10115358	Enjoyable, no.
10115518	10117019	Alright, fuck you, Xbox.
10117299	10120341	Fuck you, listener or chat person for mentioning the Xbox.
10120741	10121762	Xbox sucks.
10122262	10132648	The only game you should ever buy on Xbox other than Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball just for the jiggliness or Outlaw Volleyball for the jiggliness is Psychonauts because my friend is making that game and it's going to be badass.
10132668	10134329	But other than that, Xbox sucks.
10134490	10138472	It makes a better Linux machine and they finally hacked it with Linux without putting a mod chip in.
10139662	10142926	Okay, before we continue, because I'm going to play the devil's advocate here.
10143207	10145149	We all know the console war will never end.
10145529	10150456	I personally don't hate, or I personally don't like Xbox, but I don't want to piss off a bunch of people by saying that.
10151036	10158566	They did this Xbox propaganda thing on G4 this morning, talking about how it's so great and everything, and how it's... No.
10160575	10164359	To quote Ryan, Xbox would be better served as a weapon to hit 10 year old children with.
10180010	10180410	DirectX Box
10198519	10198960	Konami.
10199200	10200421	Let's all write letters to Konami.
10200862	10209672	Instead of wasting your production time to make stupid Xbox ports of Bomani games, why don't you put your time into making 7th style for home PS2?
10209812	10212375	So we can have 2DX at home again.
10213637	10216600	No, I don't care if it's US or Japanese, I want more 2DX at home.
10216620	10218523	Okay, this is the problem.
10219306	10219906	This is the problem.
10220646	10224307	Yes, DDR Xbox will have enjoyable, downloadable content.
10224467	10229148	And in fact, I predict DDR Xbox is going to be the best fucking DDR game they've done yet.
10229448	10230028	Do you know why?
10230408	10233289	Because we're all sitting here bitching about how we're not going to buy it and support the Xbox.
10233609	10234989	And that's the way God works.
10235850	10238470	It will probably have enjoyable, downloadable content.
10238990	10243331	At the price of $50 a month in addition to your normal cost of the game for Xbox Live.
10245072	10246092	Xbox Live is $50 a month?
10251888	10254730	I mean, it's going to cost me $15 a month to play EverQuest 2.
10254790	10257251	I'm not going to pay $50 for Xbox Live.
10258072	10260013	All we're going to do is make the DWIs in a few days.
10260393	10267097	Oh, speaking of which, unless someone beats me to it, I'm making the DWIs for the Max to Exclusive songs.
10267977	10269518	Those will be coming out probably pretty soon.
10270098	10272060	I'm really shocked those haven't already been done.
10272400	10275361	People have just been lazy, actually, and haven't gotten their game or just don't care.
10275481	10276342	I can make mine, like...
10277743	10279985	I can make them the night if I wanted to.
10280005	10282487	The question is do I want to.
10284443	10289326	The next question is from SoCalKicks, and I accidentally closed his window, but I sort of remember what it said.
10289346	10291047	Oh, I remember that guy, a long time ago.
10291067	10294549	Yeah, I know, he has disappeared, but he actually asked a question.
10294890	10299252	For those who may not remember SoCalKicks, let me play a little something.
10299272	10303555	Bastion has a bigger mall than we do, and it's cooler, and they have a Dave and Buster's there.
10304235	10306196	Yeah, we met SoCalKicks some time ago.
10306257	10309238	They have a guy that gives massages in the mall, and it was, ah, so good.
10310499	10313381	For those of you that forget SoCalKicks, here's a little reminder.
10317213	10318633	Everybody, this is DSDS.
10318673	10322474	Make sure to visit SoCalKicks.com and you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
10322694	10325674	We finally accomplished ultimate evolution just now.
10326655	10330295	You know how many times I had to get him to say his own little motto for his website?
10331135	10331395	Twice.
10331555	10338997	Anyway, he wants to know, why is it that I'm not listening to this station anymore, even though I have an urge to?
10343197	10345278	Because SoCalKicks, you suck.
10348246	10348866	I don't know about that.
10348926	10349787	He seemed like a pretty cool guy.
10349947	10352768	I say he's just discovered the joys of masturbation.
10353508	10356789	Oh, spending a lot more time with Rosie Palmer and her five sisters?
10356989	10358510	I hope the window's not open still, is it?
10358650	10362432	That is no excuse whatsoever if you're listening to the radio.
10362832	10365793	I mean, that requires no hands at all.
10366821	10375703	Even if you're one-handed, you one-hand it to live365.com, you one-hand click Orange Lounge, one-click the play, and then your hand's free.
10376163	10379204	But you can even put Flash videos up and watch those at the same time.
10379944	10381965	I think we got a new sweeper here with Dark Child.
10382565	10383385	Come on, man.
10384205	10387766	Shit, man, you could probably play Step Mania and beat off at the same time.
10390051	10391212	It seems possible.
10391732	10394094	You could probably beat off and play 5-key Beatmania too.
10394114	10395775	7-key is a little hard.
10395815	10399897	He's playing 5-key Beatmania with his penis.
10400057	10403860	That was playing one-handed.
10404960	10408402	That song you played, the DWI, was like, how long?
10408422	10409223	45 minutes?
10410443	10412825	Yeah, that made your hand more tired than masturbating, I'm sure.
10414986	10416407	It's a workout for my right hand.
10417580	10429784	I did also perfect combo the beauty of silence one-handed, so... The beauty of... I full comboed the skin flute one-handed.
10431204	10432345	Oh, flute man, I mean.
10432485	10433025	That's the song.
10434286	10435366	Anyway, moving right along.
10435866	10440428	I'm waiting to get yelled at for that answer, but since he's not listening, he won't hear it unless somebody communicates it to him.
10440748	10445869	And right now he's probably getting 20 messages from tattletales going, They're teasing you about masturbation!
10446749	10448109	Where's he from again?
10448129	10448970	He's from Fremont?
10449490	10451090	Hence the name SoCalKicks.
10451750	10453691	SoCalKicks means he's from, you know, Hawaii.
10453731	10456472	I thought he was in, like, Amsterdam or something, you dumbass.
10457032	10458772	Is he part of, like, Team Change-O-Land?
10458792	10461933	Because, I mean, they could teach him how to masturbate properly while he sits on the radio.
10464264	10466445	In fact, don't they have a radio show there?
10467365	10467765	Who knows?
10467865	10468526	Nobody listens.
10469906	10470266	That's okay.
10470286	10471166	Nobody listens to this either.
10471787	10472467	More than them.
10472827	10474027	Oh, anyway.
10474528	10475068	Be nice.
10475748	10476328	Oh, I'll be nice.
10478449	10479309	Oh, new question.
10479329	10479769	Yes, listen.
10480209	10480649	New question.
10480669	10481570	Here we go.
10481630	10487132	John Fields wants to know, psychology or ethnic conflicts of the 20th century?
10487932	10488952	Which category for Jeopardy?
10489012	10489152	No.
10489412	10491433	He wants to know, which essay should I start next?
10493248	10497811	Psychology or... Ethnic conflicts of the 20th century.
10499552	10501853	No, I say, I mean, these people are yelling psychology.
10502153	10510538	Do the ethnic whatever, because you're going to rack your brain on that shit, and then you could actually use some of the dilemmas you'll have in your psychology paper.
10510978	10511359	I agree.
10511399	10516802	I think since psychology sounds like the easier one, do that second, so that you coast down through the second paper.
10516882	10520084	I say plagiarize a Dr. Phil episode, and there you go.
10522159	10525782	I say do the psychology if you're going to put all that work into it, at least learn how to fuck with people's heads.
10525802	10528864	Wait a minute, what were the two topics again?
10529344	10532747	Psychology or ethnic conflicts of the 20th century.
10532967	10539291	Why not do a psychology paper about the ethnic conflicts of the 20th century and then print it out twice and turn it into both classes?
10539732	10540912	Beautiful, there you go.
10540992	10541753	There's your answer.
10543814	10544895	Alright.
10546757	10549939	DDR Angel has a question for Loki.
10551286	10553147	This is a question for Loki from DDR Angel.
10553808	10554528	Will you marry me?
10554588	10555128	No, just kidding.
10557010	10559471	That question's reserved for someone else in our chat room.
10559511	10560472	We won't talk about that.
10560592	10561112	I'm just kidding.
10561172	10562293	Oh God, I'm so going to get smacked.
10562913	10567656	I'm like just waiting for the buffer to get there.
10568617	10568957	What?
10570257	10571658	Okay.
10572179	10572499	Never mind.
10572539	10573740	Anyway, here's the real question.
10575080	10576101	Oh, there, I just got smacked.
10577042	10577302	Okay.
10578403	10580305	When are you going to get to do a fuck-off?
10580405	10582166	We need your mix, Mastinus.
10582886	10583727	Well, let's see here.
10583787	10586789	First off, I need to get broadband hooked up to my computer.
10587029	10590292	Since it doesn't seem to be happening at the moment, it's not for a while.
10590312	10591292	I don't know.
10592834	10593034	Yeah.
10593294	10593814	Eventually.
10594195	10598738	It is something that will be coming to... In fact, we're hoping... This goes back to Irene's question earlier.
10599719	10601520	Hopefully, Loki will be...
10602290	10605254	Doing a regular show, like it'll be like every week at a certain time, right?
10605354	10608859	Yeah, there was going to be a mixed show, but you know, there's kind of a couple problems with that.
10608939	10610581	First off, I don't know how to mix.
10614226	10616048	So we need to kind of figure that one out first.
10616989	10620654	I can almost match, maybe you could fix that almost part and then you could do it.
10622561	10623002	I can do it.
10623022	10628427	I honestly have to go through all my records and mark down what the BPM is on in all of them.
10629608	10633332	And then I have to listen to all of them numerous times, which is going to be a bitch.
10633992	10639678	So I know what songs sound the same, beat-wise and bass-wise, so I can mix them together.
10643516	10646177	And you already know about, like, filter out to just the bass.
10646197	10651038	I'm going to get through these last couple questions before we have to end the show here.
10652358	10653919	Ah, return of a classic.
10653979	10655099	This question's for Bradley.
10655379	10655739	Penis.
10656279	10666842	And this question's been asked to a lot of people on the show, but 23rd Magus wants to know, Bradley, what would you do with two quiet Jap girls, a bucket of Choco Ready Whip, a cake pie, and a 2DX controller?
10670390	10671711	Our child wants to answer this too.
10672212	10675774	I probably go crazy and just not know what to do.
10675834	10678397	I just kind of sit in the corner and watch them play 2DX.
10680578	10681659	Dude, dude.
10681699	10684762	And film the whole thing and tell them to do crazy stuff.
10684982	10685923	It was Chocolate Ready Whip?
10686823	10688645	I play Beat Mania while eating Chocolate Ready Whip.
10689625	10690226	That's a good thing to do.
10690466	10691367	Dude, you got it.
10699474	10701556	No, no, I play Beat Mania.
10703297	10703637	I get it.
10707140	10713044	First, I'd accept the video camera, because obviously any situation with that, there would have to be a video camera in the room.
10713064	10714606	And I'd link to the website with it broadcasting on.
10714626	10715186	Oh, definitely.
10715486	10716187	Inner broadcast.
10717428	10718148	Let's see here.
10718168	10719669	Kawaii Japanese Girls.
10720010	10720910	So impressionable.
10721171	10721951	And with Ready Whip.
10722211	10723252	Are they in schoolgirl uniforms?
10723733	10726635	No, see, they have to be regular Ready Whip, because I don't like chocolate that much.
10726655	10727856	This is a question for Bradley, guys.
10727896	10728196	Come on.
10729042	10735305	This brings up a fuck you to people who use some Japanese words in English, like kawaii girls.
10735805	10737386	That's really, really fucking annoying.
10737906	10745210	Especially in this, I get Raijin Magazine, and they have a game and anime thing, and then they bring it out of somewhere out of nowhere.
10745490	10746730	This game is really kawaii.
10746750	10747871	You know what I hate?
10747891	10756015	You know what I hate is when people mispronounce anime and spell it wrong when they email me at work asking me questions about anime.
10756115	10757295	I want to know about the anima.
10757655	10758516	I want to know about the...
10760437	10761097	The enemy.
10761417	10767160	I want to know about the Japan... I can't even pronounce how they say it.
10767260	10769160	It's like the Japanimation.
10769601	10770301	Just write them back.
10770341	10772382	The enema is up your ass and you are the enemy.
10775503	10776503	Japaninamco nation?
10776523	10776844	I don't know.
10776964	10777184	Anyway.
10777944	10779325	They're like Japanime.
10779465	10780325	Japanime.
10781486	10782026	Japanime.
10783306	10784327	I like that, Japanime.
10784927	10786488	Okay, here we go.
10786968	10789669	Dartetsuyu would like to know, have you ever played Parodius?
10790549	10792070	Gogucho, Sexy, etc.
10792730	10793411	Anybody, I guess.
10793451	10794951	He didn't direct it towards any particular person.
10797573	10798813	Yeah, I've played it.
10798953	10802315	I have like two or three of the games on Saturn, so I've played it sometimes.
10802355	10804876	I'll tell you right now, I have played Parodius, and it sucks.
10804936	10805456	Play Gradius.
10805536	10807297	God.
10807997	10809698	I've played it for a little bit on Nintendo Emulator.
10810459	10812520	Oh, come on, don't play Gradius, play Life Force.
10813721	10814521	Salamander, you mean?
10815221	10815902	You know what I love?
10816082	10818643	I love most about Parodius as the penguins.
10820784	10825986	Just what you're playing, I don't know, I just, I think Gradius is still the classic Konami shooter.
10827407	10829188	It's got burning heat in it, Gradius 2, so.
10830989	10834550	Yes, well, there's going to be a Gradius, what is it, 5 on PS2?
10835310	10836171	That should be interesting.
10837291	10838432	I hope they make it like, uh,
10839545	10840325	I think it'll be good.
10842206	10843546	Oh, yes, the new Contra.
10844266	10844927	I haven't played it yet.
10846527	10846747	Yes.
10847767	10848308	Bad radio.
10848488	10849468	Oh, sorry.
10849828	10856410	UK Bondage Boy wanted to back up something that Bradley had said in the last bit about Japan English.
10857510	10859791	It's like having the screen name Nico Bubblegum.
10860131	10862652	Yes, let's be multicultural and trendy.
10862672	10862932	Okay, Rob.
10868064	10869185	Okay, last question.
10869705	10871246	Last question for Ask Orange Lounge.
10871266	10871887	Sorry, everybody.
10872527	10877070	The last question is from Justin B. He wants to know, when will this show ever end?
10877930	10878971	The answer is right now.
10879031	10881012	So let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10881473	10882193	Final thought.
10886416	10892339	I know way too much things about my mother that I wish I never knew or heard uttered from her mouth.
10892360	10893060	Diddy Garholic.
10897046	10899107	English is very, very nice fun.
10899327	10899747	Thank you.
10901148	10902429	You want to go now, Loki, or at the end?
10902909	10903570	I don't care, whatever.
10903590	10904070	All right, Loki.
10905411	10906451	Oh, I guess I'm going now.
10906871	10912335	I can't believe I missed Simpsons, and the TV is right here, but I was watching Most Extremely Nation Challenge, which I saw yesterday.
10913015	10913475	Go fig.
10915096	10915596	Whatever.
10915857	10920219	I said, like, I was going to watch it every week now that I had the TV and cable, but no.
10920679	10921320	Had to be stupid.
10921360	10921660	Whatever.
10923191	10925593	TheWretchedEvilIceQueen, and Haggad.
10928696	10929016	That's it?
10930538	10932700	Just deep panting for the Ice Queen.
10933560	10934241	Take her now.
10934501	10936423	This is a very serious final thought, everybody.
10936683	10937144	Yes, Brad?
10937184	10937604	Everybody!
10939646	10941888	Everybody, this is a serious... Come on!
10942929	10943950	Very serious final thought.
10944980	10948902	I don't care if you believe in God or any religion or praying at all.
10949562	10954804	Everybody please pray to Konami that Castlevania for PS2 is going to be a good game.
10955184	10955965	It's not going to suck.
10956325	10957385	It is very serious.
10957485	10958206	I am very serious.
10958246	10959026	Everybody, please.
10959506	10959847	Amen.
10960387	10960667	Amen.
10960687	10961827	Can I get a witness in here?
10962148	10963428	What are you talking about?
10963448	10965369	When's the last time Konami's fucked something up?
10966890	10968230	Don't get me started.
10968810	10969751	We won't even utter.
10972828	10974608	We're not going to mention that name on the radio.
10977169	10978529	Rice Princess, final thought.
10978570	10979690	What kind of world is this?
10979950	10980890	It's kind of crap.
10981710	10981990	Bye.
10983211	10984351	Bradley, final thought.
10985231	10987352	Hooray for the random Oni course.
10987812	10989432	It's evil and fun all wrapped into one.
10990853	10991493	That was poetic.
10993020	11006985	I'm sure if Jamie were here, her final thought would be squee, or we, or I own you, or something like that, or Battle Royale something, or sleep, I need sleep, or let's go get tapioca, any of the above would be Jamie's final thought, I'm pretty sure.
11007105	11010466	I would say with pretty good accuracy, I think I got it.
11011747	11015108	My final thought is, I need sex.
11020310	11021370	How much are you willing to pay?
11023898	11024378	Never mind.
11024398	11026459	I could be whoever you want.
11029079	11029819	Can you be Anita?
11031159	11032860	Oh, I could sure try.
11035220	11038001	I did get really drunk last night and I touched... Never mind.
11038181	11038701	We won't go there.
11040901	11042581	And it wasn't my boobie?
11048082	11048662	Anyway.
11050803	11051583	Who'd you molest?
11052330	11054633	I'm going to get in trouble for saying that on air.
11055074	11056656	Final word of the night.
11056696	11058859	I'll give the final word of the night to the Ice Queen.
11060080	11061322	The haggard, wretched Ice Queen.
11061943	11063285	The haggard, wretched Ice Queen.
11063865	11064326	Final word.
11064626	11065387	No, one word.
11065407	11066108	You get one word.
11066168	11066549	Final word.
11067690	11067971	Good.
