1810	2690	Message for you, son!
3130	4410	Attention!
5011	8912	Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?
10512	15554	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.
19219	22160	Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
22480	25680	Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
26240	28961	Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
29501	32402	Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.
33182	33582	Just kidding.
33782	35382	Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.
35582	38123	In this episode... Hey, are there any balls down there?
38143	40323	That's the biggest fairy you've ever seen, Tinkle Fairy.
40343	42104	What's your favorite scary movie?
49022	49602	Showgirls.
50503	51724	Absolutely frightful.
51924	52725	What's yours?
52745	55206	There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.
55266	57148	Don't torture yourself.
57168	58028	That's my job.
58148	59890	Now's the time our sprockets made me dogs!
59950	63052	I'll get you, my pretty!
63272	64593	And your little dog, too!
64993	65914	I know Kung Fu.
66254	68876	I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.
68916	70757	Why did they have to take the word gay?
72378	75000	No one expects a Spanish exposition!
75280	76141	It's Kendo.
76181	76521	Hey!
78971	80773	DarkSakura Shut up!
80973	81654	Where's my gun?
81774	83716	This is my boomstick!
84176	86699	Sky Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!
87019	90763	Loki I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.
90803	93565	What kind of warping being would find that funny?
93846	95327	Orange Lounge Radio
98251	103434	We are live, and this is episode number 44 for May the 11th of 2003.
103634	111839	You're tuned into the Bimani Scene's most sleep-deprived radio station of all things B-Money.
113380	115521	My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.
117182	119223	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.
119883	121564	Well, usually awesome co-hosts.
121804	124546	When the show's not going on, they're pretty awesome.
126522	129082	In this corner, the happiest buddy on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.
129122	130443	You know her better as DarkSakura.
131163	132863	Um, insert witty comment here.
133523	135384	In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.
135904	136164	Hello.
136684	140364	Who hooked up the microphones in amazing 15 seconds before we started tonight's show.
142585	145225	Also with us tonight, say hello to Intern Zero.
145965	147866	I can't get this fucking cookie out of the package.
147886	149646	It's, like, pissing me off.
149666	150726	That sounds kind of sexual.
151166	151566	Shut up.
152587	154907	Damn it, I'm not really going to be able to get that one out.
156624	157164	That was great.
157364	159766	Jamie went, and she got the cookie out of the package, and then she ate it.
162427	163607	That was almost zing-worthy.
164748	165008	Nice.
165348	166169	She got one for me.
166549	167369	She's redeemed.
167789	169210	So it's just the four of us here tonight.
170471	171991	Getting really close, getting to know each other.
172752	173652	Loving each other a little more.
176874	179815	We'll be talking to everyone more a bit later, but first we're going to take a quick break.
182357	183357	We're going to break stuff.
183897	185158	We're taking a hit off the cookie.
185993	187214	Describe these cookies you're eating.
187234	191335	They're interesting because they come in a plastic wrapped thing.
191396	193677	It looks like a can of Pringles, but they're cookies.
194277	195717	Yes, they're shingles.
196098	198339	No, they're German cookies.
199539	205422	And they're like dark German chocolate, but it doesn't really taste like dark chocolate, between two thin cookies, and it's really good.
206342	208203	And it tastes good, too.
208443	209304	Are these people moving?
210204	211065	Yeah, our neighbors are moving.
212065	212325	Good.
212825	213746	You don't need neighbors.
214830	216431	Mr. Rogers isn't around anymore.
216451	217291	We don't need neighbors.
219212	219992	You're so nice.
220112	220992	Everyone's so nice here.
222013	223673	I got his and that thingy's.
224554	227155	Okay, we're going to start this break with an interesting song.
227315	228355	This is an interesting song.
228375	229675	This is something that was downloaded.
229695	231416	It was sent to me from DarkTetsuya in the chatroom.
231456	233437	He got it from MGZ.com.
233777	237438	And this is supposedly from Night Style, although there's a little bit of skepticism about it.
237879	240580	It's V remixed by Naoki.
241520	241740	Okay.
242045	250550	But there's a lot of skepticism going on around this one, and this is the reason why people are skeptical, because it's really good quality, and no good quality MP3s have come out from Nightstyle yet.
250950	255413	That, and the fact that this MP3 is two and a half minutes, which, for a 2DX song, that's a long ass time.
255433	256674	I'm not sure it's really long.
257114	257675	Yeah, what?
257695	258835	Solo's heard me go, bleh.
259836	260656	Two and a half minutes?
261257	265720	Well, then it's a possibility, but it's kind of, you know, we're not saying it's official.
266260	267801	We're not saying it's official, but it might be.
268101	270022	And if it is official, then we were the first to play it, right?
270042	270723	Yeah.
271826	272328	So enjoy this.
272348	276699	We're going to play this V remix by Naoki, and then we'll play something from Taka and something from Naoki.
277261	277902	And then we'll be back.
278604	278905	Enjoy!
490792	491553	DarkSakura.com
524084	524746	Thanks for watching!
553074	553958	Thanks for watching!
642337	644122	Thanks for watching!
677049	678289	Orange Lounge Radio.
678610	680770	We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
684912	687873	Hi.
688533	690034	I can say words in reverse, too.
690494	690754	Do it.
690974	691654	Mom.
693375	693555	Radar.
693835	695055	God and dog.
696576	697096	Radar.
697876	699177	Or that'd be Radair.
699517	700477	Race car, right?
701057	701558	Race car.
701718	701938	Yeah.
702118	702658	Yeah, race car.
704798	706859	Speaking of mom, happy Mother's Day.
706980	709641	Happy Mother's Day, and I didn't let my mom listen to the show.
709741	712884	To all of our mothers out there listening, which hopefully is none of them.
714004	715625	Mom's like, I want to listen to your radio show.
716266	717006	Um, no you don't.
719864	720444	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
740093	742414	No, we don't do the sex quiz on this show, but it's still pretty bad.
742474	747575	You know, it's too bad though that we do Rocky on Saturday nights because we can't listen to Travis and Jenna.
747835	750236	Well, I'm trying to see if they're ever going to rebroadcast their show.
750596	752917	I know they do, they have new shows, they have spin-off shows now.
752937	756398	They have like the 80s show and some club, goth club show that Travis does.
756778	759799	So, oh yeah, so we'll plug Under Station Live, our buddies over there.
760379	761139	Yeah, goth talk.
768081	772089	And I'm Azrael Abyss, Prince of Sorrow It's a piece of shit
777474	781716	If that was Naoki, then it means that Naoki sat on V and farted and out that came.
783597	784078	I'm sorry.
785038	787239	As much as we bag on Naoki, he's very talented.
788140	789561	And I know he could do much better than that.
789621	790401	That is not Naoki.
790981	796864	And anyone who thinks that that's Naoki, who actually believes that that's a Naoki remix, needs to get their head examined.
797305	798805	Or either that or get it out of the toilet.
798825	800906	So what are you going to do if it comes out that that's real?
803008	803768	Are you going to have a cry?
805465	809466	No, I'm probably never going to listen to another Naoki mix again because he's lost all of his talent.
811507	813608	Maybe let Politary remix it and put his name on it.
815608	816368	Oh, maybe that's it.
816408	818209	Maybe let Politary do all the work this time.
820250	821370	I can tell that it's unique.
822924	823524	It's special.
823584	824144	Eating a cookie.
825625	828926	First of all, I was in band and I took music theory and music appreciation and everything.
828946	829987	I started off as a music major.
831407	833928	I have listened to Winter so many times, it's not even funny.
835029	840531	And I could tell that the second half of the song was completely ripped from Winter.
840751	842711	It was actually, you know, unique parts.
844152	846893	So that is the only way I could think that that's a new mix.
847713	848654	But Nelke could do better.
849414	850174	So much better.
850975	851995	So I don't think that's Nelke.
852694	859620	As Like La Morete La Bierte, which is the other song we heard in there, the last song we heard in that break, which is a good Naoki song, very good Naoki song.
860280	861761	And in the middle there was Tomorrow Perfume.
862422	863663	Everybody knows that one, from Taka.
863763	866085	That song pissed me off.
866585	867386	Why does that piss you off?
868727	870628	Just because it's difficult, it's a seven.
871789	875192	Have you seen the latest custom non-stop that's in our machine at Scandia?
875292	875332	No.
875713	877794	It's sad, I mean it's like really hard.
877994	879255	Who decided that one goes in?
879996	880917	I'll give you two guesses.
881920	884123	The first guess starts with an E and ends with Rick.
884824	885565	I'll bet you anything.
887827	888808	You should let me put one in.
889549	893214	You should let me put one in and that'd be like seven stars Jamie can pass.
893874	895216	Three of them in the last two songs would be blank.
897839	899621	It could be like ones you've almost passed.
900942	901582	Come really close.
902442	904763	But no, this is the songs that he has in there.
904803	913706	Summer Vacation, Tomorrow Perfume, Traces, Xenon, and A. And you know what's really fucked about that?
914126	919507	You can't change your speeds in the middle of a non-stop course on 8th style or whatever when you're playing 2DX non-stops.
919527	920387	You can't change your speed.
920788	924709	So whatever speed you play Summer Vacation on, like I play High Speed 3, you have to.
924909	925829	You have to play A on.
927259	932843	We just take a hit right after, you know, like, right before A. Then everything's like bullet time.
932903	936405	Just like, I see the keys coming down!
937626	937766	Ugh!
938887	939327	Yay!
940628	941288	You and drugs.
944290	944730	You should.
946731	947192	I'm just kidding.
947212	947592	Don't do drugs.
947612	948412	Drugs are bad, okay?
949173	949673	Drugs are bad.
950974	951634	I'm very happy.
951934	952475	Why are you happy?
952495	954496	Because I just had a cookie.
955848	957589	You know what that whole drugs thing reminds me of?
958950	963753	On Beemani Sims, Omnicrash made a song called Beemani Song.
964774	970577	And he like totally... Is that the one that sounds like the sunscreen song?
970597	971798	Yeah, yeah, here we go.
971838	974540	Wait, okay, we're gonna hear a clip.
974560	975801	This song is so mean.
978882	983984	It is short, but you gotta play the best part in the middle, right after the least 100 seconds.
984764	985404	Oh, sorry.
986585	987365	That's just me, though.
987925	991247	I don't know, that song is so funny, especially when it talks about jokes.
992807	995308	You'll like it, but he can't say DWI.
995828	996869	He says DWI.
997609	998609	DWI.
998849	1003371	Okay, what we'll do to make this interesting is we'll let Loki play the whole song, and we'll make live commentary.
1007082	1011524	Alright, Loki's going to find that, so we'll broadcast that to you a little bit.
1013225	1014506	What else is new?
1014686	1015846	Any other Mother's Day things?
1015866	1017227	What did you guys do for Mother's Day today?
1017527	1020628	I called my mom on my cell phone driving into his house.
1021609	1022689	Driving into my house?
1023290	1028552	I was turning to go down the street to your house and I was on the phone with my mom and I had to hang up with her.
1028712	1033715	I prefer not to be retarded and drive and talk on my cell phone because I would likely...
1035983	1037864	I know you do it and I still think it's retarded.
1038564	1038924	Okay?
1040284	1041545	I tried to call my mom.
1041745	1042805	She didn't answer her phone.
1042825	1044785	I don't think she wants to hear from me today.
1045846	1049506	But we only talk like once a month, so I mean... Are those your neighbors that I hate?
1049526	1050727	No.
1050747	1051367	The ones upstairs?
1051387	1051427	No.
1052067	1052787	The ones downstairs.
1053287	1053808	Oh, poo.
1053828	1054968	I wish the ones that I hate would move.
1054988	1056188	I can go kick their door.
1056388	1056968	No, I'm just kidding.
1057488	1058289	The ones that I hate?
1058309	1060889	Yeah, when we met them, they were nice.
1060909	1061629	The people over there?
1061649	1062330	Up here.
1063230	1063750	Yeah, they were...
1064386	1066287	Anime, it's better than sex Anime, it's better than sex
1090256	1090736	What's that say?
1091417	1091877	Sweet.
1092758	1093158	We're lucky.
1093238	1094980	It's Sobey Zen here.
1095440	1096161	Wait, what's mine say?
1096201	1096461	Hold on.
1097702	1101765	Mine says... I got Robisobey.
1102666	1104427	Merchant of the Mekong Delta.
1105248	1106909	Okay.
1109431	1111994	I know, isn't it nice when you can get a DWI in like five seconds?
1113295	1116517	Mine pisses me off, because it's a fucking political reference.
1116657	1117118	What's it say?
1117318	1119139	George W. Lizardo...
1120555	1121636	Some stupid crap.
1122036	1122356	What?
1123577	1125799	Yeah, I hate this political crap.
1126079	1128300	Oh, time for the best song in the world.
1130482	1131642	Wait, ah, what's this say?
1133203	1135485	George W. Lizardo, it really does say that.
1135525	1136125	That's sad.
1136806	1137987	Alright, let's hear the song.
1142810	1143650	Loading, loading.
1143750	1145732	Can you turn it up a little?
1146587	1149750	Bimani Ruler's V is not the greatest DOI ever.
1150330	1151671	Neither is his A. Hold on.
1151711	1153133	We're going to do it again.
1155034	1159278	La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.
1159698	1160819	Connect the dots.
1161079	1161960	La, la.
1162340	1163081	Now loading.
1163101	1164462	Now loading.
1165984	1166704	Now maroding.
1167545	1169867	At least my soapy thing didn't say something about me, Crob.
1170648	1172209	This is the Bimani Sim's song.
1173695	1173955	I agree.
1173975	1174175	I agree.
1174235	1175396	Pretty much, yeah.
1175436	1175836	That's debatable.
1175876	1176416	How would you know?
1176496	1177756	I don't, I don't, I don't.
1202967	1203568	That was dumb.
1203588	1204328	Thank you, yes.
1219022	1224743	Anyone with the name like Dynamite Rave 68246 Ani is not to be trusted.
1225804	1226604	Okay, yeah, huh?
1226844	1228724	All the things she said has been done.
1229224	1229764	I don't care!
1229784	1230184	It's a great song!
1230204	1231825	All the things she didn't say.
1232945	1236646	My next two DIYs involve poltergeists and pants.
1237926	1239846	X-Step is the antichrist.
1240807	1242027	BimaniStyle owns me.
1242367	1243107	Yes, it's true.
1244007	1247348	At least 100 seconds is enough time for me to get a sandwich.
1248348	1252712	Mooglehunter is on speed on possibly every other drug known to man.
1252892	1256436	The world needs more spontaneous para para dancing.
1257657	1260239	The background to Zenon is really stupid.
1261420	1263883	Not every song needs challenge steps.
1264684	1265064	I'm done.
1269835	1270435	You know what's funny?
1270635	1272356	How come we've never had Moogle Hunter on this show?
1272376	1274417	He freaking lives not too far away.
1274437	1277098	Yeah, because he's too busy doing drugs, apparently.
1277538	1280920	And then to quote Dinosaur, when he dies, we'll smoke his ashes.
1284041	1284721	Who did that song?
1284761	1285521	Who gets credit for that?
1286642	1287162	Omnicrash.
1289143	1290243	He didn't say Oni right.
1290984	1292164	Yeah, he mispronounced a bunch of words.
1292764	1293965	He must be Canadian or something.
1296126	1296766	Is he Canadian?
1297226	1298787	Because Canadians pronounce things funny.
1300663	1303063	Yeah, he said like Sakura and DUIs.
1304244	1304624	Zenon.
1305844	1306664	I think he's Canadian.
1307944	1309204	Not that there's anything wrong with that.
1309224	1311285	Whenever you make a mistake, just pretend you're Canadian.
1313325	1313905	I'm Canadian.
1313965	1314825	Hey, I fucked up.
1315666	1316926	No one expects you to be smart.
1317746	1320466	You should put the right emphasis on the correct syllable.
1327508	1328968	Hey, street blowjobs!
1331405	1335287	And that guy looks happy because he's thinking about his blowjob that he's getting right then.
1335307	1338928	Is it attached to his ass?
1339088	1349392	I'm thinking about the new intro and all the clips from Jamie I can grab.
1349412	1350293	We get to watch blowjobs.
1357401	1379438	Because the show just isn't the show without porn Wait, so you actually clicked on a pop-up ad And now we're going to see some street blowjobs This is why you told your mom not to listen That's why she told her mom not to listen Yeah Well, this works Give me street blowjobs Winif sucks my ass That's why you're not supposed to use Winif Did Winif just freeze on you?
1379998	1383421	Yeah, we'll fix that problem He's a media player That's what I was going to do
1385464	1387988	In the meantime, I will do a song and dance that none of you will see or hear.
1389991	1390431	It's in my head.
1390471	1391433	Beautiful, beautiful.
1392494	1393976	Rob did a nice dance last night.
1393996	1397882	Pirouetting across the screen in a tutu.
1398002	1400326	I have never had so many people yelling at me.
1401030	1401690	in a tutu.
1402230	1404091	Come to think of it, I've never worn a tutu before last night.
1404111	1407252	It wasn't really a tutu, but you should have worn at least the Frank wig or something.
1407912	1410133	I know, I should have had a wig, but... You were still fabulous.
1410153	1412473	We were trying to dig up a wig backstage, we couldn't find one.
1412513	1414494	I mean, we literally pulled that routine out of our ass.
1414714	1415474	But you know what's ironic?
1415494	1417475	Do you know where my outfit for last night... They tried to get me up there.
1418715	1419355	Did they try?
1419935	1422396	Um, Lindsay tried to get me to be Veronica.
1422416	1425017	Lindsay doesn't know that you went backstage.
1425037	1425297	I told her...
1430638	1431098	Yeah.
1431799	1434260	So what are you, uh, shopping for?
1434320	1438563	I'm just trying to browse and stuff, dude.
1438583	1439083	Yeah.
1439103	1439884	There you go.
1439924	1441225	Hey, listen, I'm gonna be honest with you.
1441325	1443686	Do you want to, uh, be interested in making a little extra money?
1443706	1446408	Hey, to help you out with your shopping.
1446428	1448109	Dude, I'm pretty set with my shopping time.
1448129	1448469	Oh, yeah?
1448489	1448689	Yeah.
1451784	1452124	Okay.
1453505	1454065	Alright then.
1454845	1455985	Dude, that looks like Arden Fair.
1457026	1457906	Oh my god, it does!
1458206	1460347	Now I'm following you.
1460367	1462807	Kind of looking for some company.
1462847	1465128	Just wondering if you're interested.
1465148	1467409	What do I have in mind?
1467689	1468269	It's almost over.
1468289	1469509	That's enough time to blow it off.
1471030	1471410	Oh, but...
1481849	1484892	So, like, out of that whole thing, there were, like, maybe two seconds of a blowjob.
1484912	1487835	Dude, you should send that to... Obviously an actress.
1488396	1489657	You should send that to Evan for a pre-show.
1489877	1492860	That totally... I look like... I swear to God that's a mall I've been to.
1493321	1494662	I think it was one in L.A., though.
1494762	1496404	I reckon... No, this is the sad thing.
1496444	1498446	This shows you, like, what a queer I am, okay?
1498827	1501209	I recognize the Campbell's store in the background.
1510206	1513789	I want my old pop-up blocker back because this one sucks ass.
1514630	1514870	Yeah.
1515410	1518353	Hey, while you're on that site, get me the one for Nero.
1518373	1521235	I already have it.
1521335	1522496	Okay, for the Nero 5.
1522556	1525259	Yeah, anyway, what were we talking about before we started talking about sex?
1525639	1526480	Oh yeah, our moms.
1526500	1531764	Because without that and our mom, we wouldn't be here today.
1531784	1535447	Dude, we were having a cool conversation though at that truck stop.
1536108	1536248	Uh-huh.
1537191	1537611	That's great.
1537631	1538631	The Silver Skillet.
1538651	1540152	Truck stops, blowjobs, and your mom.
1541252	1542753	Truck stops, blowjobs, and your mom.
1542773	1544513	Some people we know were likely conceived.
1546034	1550535	Only on Orange Lounge Radio where you hear truck stops, blowjobs, and your mother all in the same sentence.
1550555	1557037	We're talking about life being a sexually transmitted fatal disease that's hereditary.
1559857	1560778	That's the secret of life?
1561738	1564619	It is a sexually transmitted fatal disease that's hereditary.
1565700	1568662	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1585643	1586244	www.DarkSakura.com
1605693	1607354	Oh, God, that is an old people's store.
1607434	1608515	I don't know people's stuff.
1608615	1615799	But, like, you can, if you need to get, you know, like, toothbrushes and all your drugstore needs there, it's really cheap, and you can get prescriptions, they're cheap, too.
1616180	1627506	If that's the only store where you walk in, and you have lawn furniture, lawn care, you turn the corner, you have herbal, like, stuff, and then you go back around, and you see nothing but prune juice and diapers.
1628988	1633232	And there's like the whole section dedicated to soy and wild yam products.
1644844	1646084	For women who need their estrogen.
1646104	1647785	Spam, spam, spam, spamity spams.
1648225	1648865	No, wild yam.
1650125	1652486	Women can take it when they're going through menopause to help with hot flashes.
1653626	1656566	See, something that none of you people probably knew.
1656666	1657787	I worked at GNC for a long time.
1657847	1659347	I needed to know.
1659407	1661988	Trust me, women, you're going to get through menopause in one day.
1662088	1663268	Mine's 20 years off.
1666849	1668149	I'm never having kids either.
1668931	1672772	Dear Women, this is Jamie's herbal tip of the day.
1672792	1676632	You smoke the weed, not eat it.
1680993	1684394	Somebody in the chat room is insinuating that I have that not-so-fresh feeling.
1685034	1685454	You don't.
1686274	1689115	I've been feeling a little... I wouldn't say I don't feel not-so-fresh.
1689615	1691215	I just feel not-so-sleepy.
1691815	1695576	I think that Frank would have been in a better mood if he had feminine wipes.
1698311	1698891	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1717003	1718504	Has any of that stuff been washed?
1719164	1720045	Um, the costumes?
1720505	1723908	They wash them, they don't wash them every week, but they wash them like once a month.
1724248	1728030	Okay, because I was going to say, it's probably a good idea.
1728050	1729731	I do wash my underwear.
1729952	1731092	Oh, I wasn't talking about your underwear.
1731112	1731893	I don't care about your underwear.
1732533	1734214	If you want to wear itchy underwear, you can.
1734675	1735775	That's your prerogative.
1736856	1738777	I'm talking about... That's my right as an American.
1739418	1743581	If I want to wear dirty underwear in public, you can't stop me.
1743661	1744881	No, we'll buy you panty liners.
1744901	1745062	Okay.
1747606	1748327	Hi, neighbors.
1749968	1751008	Now we know why.
1751629	1752970	Ran moves in, they move out.
1755791	1756592	Loki, what are you doing?
1757793	1764037	I was getting my Acid 4 to work because I upgraded my computer and I'll be talking about that later.
1765057	1769680	Go A. Oh, are you going to make the A speed remix here?
1770341	1771762	The A Naoki remix here?
1772290	1777592	Oh yeah, no, I have to find it on the internet, because I think I know a place where it might be.
1777972	1783075	He's gonna download it from mbz.com, you know, my bet's owed.
1786136	1792599	See, I could probably sit on a record and fart out a better remix.
1792839	1794299	We have a record player, come over here.
1794340	1795440	I'm not gonna sit on his record player.
1797501	1799082	I didn't sit on the record player, I sit on the record.
1799102	1799862	Oh, okay.
1802288	1804049	You missed movie night last week.
1804709	1806510	When we watched a trauma movie.
1806530	1807390	When was movie night?
1808210	1808691	At Evans.
1809231	1809971	Oh, what did you guys watch?
1810551	1811952	I don't know what the name of the movie was.
1812232	1812892	Well, I don't remember.
1813212	1817294	But it was one of those trauma movies where they get all these... No, it was Catholic Schoolgirl Hell.
1818134	1818834	That's the name of the movie?
1818954	1819295	I think.
1819355	1819735	Cool.
1820155	1824597	Where they go into this house, but there were no boobs, and there was, you know, the blood was made out of A1.
1826798	1835402	But, like, they go in this house, and, like, this little boy goes in first, on there, and he comes out and has a seizure and goes in the hospital.
1836542	1846807	And then these girls go in, because the man who lived in the house died, and the girls go in to catalog the paintings and things with this nun.
1846867	1847507	The nun was cool.
1849528	1852349	I bet, like, that little kid went into a seizure because a priest touched him.
1853230	1853450	No.
1854850	1856911	Oh my god, the acting in that was so horrible.
1856971	1863054	And then, like, no one died cool except for the girl who got caught in a meat hook, but all they showed was her feet with A1 dripping down her feet.
1864515	1865775	And one girl got electrocuted.
1866476	1866916	That's cool.
1866976	1869277	Another one got pulled into the swamp and some guy got run over.
1871931	1879037	My friend Garrett has this trauma movie, Killer Condom, that he's been trying to get us to watch that for weeks and weeks.
1879077	1881339	We never seem to get around to watching it.
1881359	1883861	There's always something better to do, like play poppin' music or something.
1884321	1886383	But we're going to watch Killer Condom one of these nights.
1886403	1887164	You'll have to come watch.
1887324	1888965	I'm sure Garrett would love to have you come over and watch it.
1889986	1890547	What did you do now?
1893601	1897623	My headphones are attached to a giant pile of cords.
1898463	1905166	It's like what Loki's doing right now is pulling out the Christmas tree lights at Christmas time and finding they're just in one giant pile.
1905186	1905727	You know what?
1905847	1909688	In my house, that never was an issue because I was evil with the twisty ties.
1912090	1914791	I always hated pulling out the lights and having them be all tangly.
1915901	1919183	I would wrap them in a circle and bunch them together and twisty tie them.
1919604	1921285	You're so anally retentively fun.
1921685	1922746	I'd bite my ass.
1923166	1924347	I'll show you anal retentive.
1925647	1929290	See what happens when you have a steel-toed boot shoved up your butt from kicking?
1929770	1930971	You'll be coughing up nails.
1933793	1937435	I don't think I've ever heard you so, like, threatening on this show before.
1937795	1939316	You're a badass bitch tonight.
1940157	1940397	I am.
1941260	1941841	Yes, you are.
1941881	1942882	I didn't mean that, by the way.
1943563	1944363	I mean it with puppies.
1947987	1949509	Wait, you're going to kick puppy in the ass?
1949909	1950290	No!
1950310	1951231	What did he do to you?
1951331	1952452	You're a mean old lady.
1952492	1954234	No, I'm going to get puppy a puppy.
1954915	1955916	Are you going to get puppy a puppy?
1956096	1957738	When he has somewhere he can have a puppy.
1958888	1959709	That's very nice of you.
1959749	1960869	I'm sure he appreciates that.
1961590	1965212	And now we have the little frowny face from Puppy in the chat room as the buffer hits him.
1965392	1967074	I'm not kicking Puppy.
1967814	1969375	I like Puppy right there.
1974319	1974579	No.
1974719	1976860	Orange Lounge goes to Korea next week.
1980022	1980623	I didn't go there.
1980663	1981303	I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
1981924	1982304	You did.
1982324	1982984	Yeah, I did, I did.
1983945	1985366	Here, have some more hazelnut bites.
1985446	1986247	Okay, give me.
1986427	1986827	What are these?
1986907	1987287	Let's read.
1987848	1987948	What?
1990336	1991217	Sorry, Loki's ass.
1992738	1993158	Oops.
1995200	1997562	I didn't throw nuts at his ass.
1997582	1999824	I threw nut cream at his ass.
2001465	2001925	Let's see.
2002946	2009752	This is Loker Quadratini Hazelnut Premium Wafer Cookies, and they're filled with hazelnut cream.
2009772	2010512	They're European.
2010592	2011593	Number one in Italy.
2016617	2017758	I got them at the old people's store.
2018138	2018358	They were $2.00.
2019335	2020696	They look like old people food.
2021456	2022537	No, they're international.
2022997	2024038	If you eat them, you're cultured.
2025939	2027180	You sure could use it.
2030382	2031663	I don't feel any culture.
2036746	2037947	Hey, look.
2038227	2039908	Hentai done by the guy who did Tenchi.
2040708	2041109	What is that?
2041669	2042449	I don't know, but I want to watch it.
2042469	2042730	Masquerade?
2042750	2043310	Is that what it's called?
2043430	2044851	Yeah, I want to finish watching Break-In.
2045538	2048139	Let's read what Masquerade is about.
2048939	2051401	Endless passion, insatiable desire.
2051421	2055222	19-year-old Gen's family... I've watched this one.
2055302	2061865	Okay, it's about this chick that's going after this one guy because he has, what was it, the essence of permanence or something like that.
2062265	2062765	I want to watch it.
2090472	2091113	That was beautiful.
2091273	2092334	I want to finish watching Break-In.
2093154	2094495	We were watching Break-In before the show.
2094656	2096237	We can finish watching Break-In after the show.
2096857	2100781	But if we start watching Break-In, there's not going to be a show and our listeners will get mad and they'll write us death threats.
2101762	2102262	No, they won't.
2103063	2104524	They'll just whine online.
2104564	2107206	Listen to the cool music.
2107226	2108347	Yes, lots of cool music.
2108367	2111770	They can listen along.
2111790	2113211	What other 80s movies do you love?
2114472	2115093	Other than Break-In.
2115834	2118596	Break into Electric Boogaloo I found the sound card!
2140191	2141452	Did you see how old they were?
2142093	2144175	I don't think they had too much sex on that bed.
2144195	2146157	Just because they're old doesn't mean they don't have sex.
2146497	2149780	Well, that's like 50% of the old people population actually do.
2149860	2150881	What the fuck am I talking about?
2150901	2152143	That's a lot of old people having sex.
2153980	2154500	I'm weird.
2154520	2156941	You know, you're really pulling down the quality of this show.
2158502	2159863	That's what interns are supposed to do.
2159923	2163944	All I did was sat there and just said everything you guys said over and over again.
2163984	2172548	So you guys talked about the truck stop, some others, and the blowjobs, and how we were all bored at truck stops or something like that.
2172588	2173488	But it's cool when we do it.
2174349	2174689	Fine.
2175669	2176690	Go download more blowjobs.
2177310	2179091	Go hang out at a truck stop.
2181816	2182196	Wow.
2183597	2184097	Wow.
2184257	2185857	I think now is a good time to take a break.
2186578	2186898	No?
2187018	2187458	What are you doing?
2190318	2190659	Oh, no.
2192799	2193079	Okay.
2193499	2195220	Let's see here.
2199981	2201962	Is this going to sound like something Twin did?
2204162	2204942	Maybe.
2205042	2206363	He downloaded it, Rob.
2206423	2207063	He downloaded it.
2207984	2209505	Download it, yes.
2209765	2211887	Off of LBZ.com.
2212548	2214649	I have to fix something because, hold on.
2215130	2216050	Oh, I'll play it after the break.
2216751	2218933	Okay, so we're going to, this is something to look forward to.
2220034	2221375	Is it the Naoki remix?
2221475	2223597	Did Naoki do some pew-pews in this song and stuff?
2223617	2224377	No, Paul Terry did.
2224677	2227039	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2227860	2228721	Okay, we'll hear that.
2228961	2230762	We have that to look forward to after the break.
2231783	2236006	When we come back from the break, we're going to talk about B3, we're going to talk about E3, or we're going to talk about G4.
2238089	2238429	Play Liar Liar
2261503	2264891	We haven't done that in a long time, so we'll talk about Pump It Up.
2264931	2265472	That might be fun.
2266394	2267717	We'll be back in a little bit.
2267898	2268198	Enjoy.
2391230	2397936	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2549798	2550420	Thank you for watching!
2589807	2595452	Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Dance Band lighting music in Morse Show?
2595752	2602898	The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.
2603238	2605200	It's unearthly.
2605440	2609163	It's like being at a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.
2610034	2612034	Hello, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
2612414	2613655	We need to find that movie again.
2614235	2615475	That thing was freaking hilarious.
2615575	2616315	It was pretty funny.
2616555	2618416	I remember it was on Konami's official site, I think.
2618956	2620476	Yeah, it was linked from there somewhere.
2620896	2623557	So, Loki, did you finish downloading your A remix?
2623737	2625957	Yeah, I had to figure out what I did.
2626397	2630658	I had to figure out what I did because I had to plug in my headphones just to make sure that it was the right copy, you know.
2631818	2633258	So I had to hook it back up.
2633318	2634339	It'll just take one second.
2635699	2636119	Alrighty.
2636139	2636859	Come on!
2639048	2640309	Anyone seen any good movies lately?
2640849	2641250	Um, no.
2641390	2642450	Have you not seen X2 yet?
2643331	2643531	No.
2643771	2644272	No, not yet?
2644952	2646013	I'll take you later.
2646674	2646914	When?
2646994	2647874	Because I want to go see it again.
2648034	2648315	I don't know.
2648875	2650776	But then The Matrix is coming out and I have to go see that too.
2651817	2652258	So I don't know.
2652278	2654659	Because I want to go see X2 again for Iceman.
2657221	2659743	Hey, I'm going for my fuzzy elf.
2660520	2661060	Nightcrawler Nightcrawler
2675980	2676621	When they were cool.
2677321	2678182	Yeah, we need to go see.
2678782	2680043	Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler?
2680263	2681264	Oh, he's great.
2682105	2682325	Fabulous.
2682345	2683946	Did he keep him coming and coming and coming?
2684026	2685087	Yes, he kept us coming.
2685167	2685487	Alright.
2686248	2687008	So take me tomorrow.
2687228	2699637	Now, now, now, I don't know if this is a fake one because, you know, I got it off of MGZ and, you know, but I know that they're very reliable with, you know, all these breaking, you know, songs just like M, you know, from Taka.
2699877	2700778	They were the first to have it.
2701198	2701619	So, um...
2702239	2706222	Here we go with A. It's a remix by Naoki.
2706282	2707223	I mean, it's amazing.
2707243	2708764	This guy is just remixing shit left and right.
2708784	2711526	This is going to be in one of the Night Style Expert Courses, right?
2711606	2719491	Oh, an exclusive Night Style Oni Challenge Mode Hidden Basic Expert Song.
2720792	2721633	Do it, Loki.
2722173	2723034	Do it all night.
2730552	2731714	Oh, this is fucking great.
2735741	2736963	I love that drum beat.
2736983	2738646	There's gonna be some mean scratches.
2748903	2751104	Oh, ow, oh, that's a cool part.
2751325	2753266	Oh, yeah, that was a freeze right there.
2754526	2758189	Yeah, but they're going to have exclusive freezes in Night Style.
2758589	2760490	We have to turn the turntable over and over and over again.
2763292	2765273	Oh, this is going to be some mean key presses right here.
2765553	2768535	I bet you this is going to be the first eight-star song.
2768555	2778061	Oh, this is great.
2781736	2782316	Wow.
2783696	2785637	An Orange Lounge Radio exclusive.
2785937	2790298	You know, I wonder if somebody submitted that to the Bomani-style remix contest.
2790358	2792898	If not, I think we need to do it on their behalf.
2797719	2798119	You know what?
2798159	2799259	I don't really think that was knocky.
2799279	2800760	I think that it was good cool.
2801040	2802580	You know what's sad?
2803640	2805840	My sound card sucks ass and is brand new.
2806041	2808421	I am so... I'll leave it for later.
2809178	2809898	I gotta make a list.
2810879	2812220	Yeah, I can do that.
2812660	2814301	Your sound card is number one in Italy.
2814561	2814941	You know what?
2822305	2825307	Your sound card is the sexiest bean tadpole on the planet.
2829549	2830690	I hope somebody got that joke.
2831430	2832190	Your house is hot.
2832390	2832731	You know what?
2832771	2836873	I think we ought to enter that remix and say it's twin, and I bet people would believe it.
2839264	2842086	No, because Twen's not talented enough to put another beat behind it.
2843647	2844368	I bet he's listening.
2846510	2847190	You want to say hello?
2847490	2848211	Hi, Twen!
2852374	2854536	With love, Orange Lawns Radio, XXOO.
2855537	2857018	I'm still, like, getting back in the chat room.
2860921	2861761	That was a good laugh.
2864090	2866451	We're having a day on Orange Lounge Radio.
2866891	2868932	This is so different being here.
2869132	2870253	I'm like sitting on a couch.
2871073	2872254	I was laying down on the couch.
2872714	2873975	You have a vanilla Coke?
2875195	2875975	I have a vanilla Coke?
2876376	2878176	It's gone.
2879777	2880177	Shit!
2884659	2886480	The vanilla Coke jumped out and attacked my phone.
2886500	2887461	I thought there was still stuff in it.
2888421	2890142	Rob, you need a trash can by your computer.
2890646	2893326	Well, I can get up and walk to the kitchen.
2893406	2894047	I am capable.
2895207	2896167	But you'd rather not.
2896187	2900228	I'd say next break we open the door to let air out.
2900248	2901968	Yeah, we can open the window to let air out.
2902248	2903028	To let air out in here.
2903308	2904368	Or we just turn on the fan.
2906329	2907409	Save electricity, open the door.
2910850	2911150	Anyway.
2913350	2916531	Oh, they're saying in the chat room that we were dissing Italy.
2916591	2916991	We weren't.
2917031	2918471	We were reading it off a bag of cookies.
2918491	2918951	Yeah.
2919218	2921100	This bag of cookies is number one in Italy.
2921260	2923182	We need to get the webcam.
2923322	2924323	No, we don't need the webcam hooked up.
2924343	2925023	We need a scanner.
2926825	2928747	I'll scan this when I get home and put it up.
2929007	2930729	We'll figure out something creative with the webcam.
2930749	2934672	I think what we're going to do is we're going to have the webcam and we'll just put it in the corner and point it at a wall.
2934692	2936374	Oh my God, it really is written in Italian.
2936714	2938776	And Chinese.
2938956	2939637	Yeah, don't open it now.
2940538	2943921	And... Holy crap, it's written in Hebrew.
2945603	2946404	I kid you not.
2947044	2950606	The stuff about the cookies is written in Hebrew.
2951227	2951427	Look.
2955850	2956790	Can you read it for us?
2956951	2957391	Fuck no.
2960111	2966153	Well, as we promised, there's many things coming up this week that's exciting.
2966773	2968793	E3 being the big one that's on everybody's minds.
2968813	2973274	The Electronic Entertainment Expo, or maybe I got that backwards.
2973294	2974955	I don't really give a shit, because I'm not going.
2975975	2977816	And Jamie, unfortunately, isn't going.
2978176	2978776	I could have.
2978836	2980416	She has that job thing going on.
2982217	2983497	Zero is not going.
2985038	2986558	And Loki is not going either.
2987463	2989203	But Dan always brings back new stuff for you guys.
2990124	2993004	Well, he hasn't been there before we did from that manager meeting he went to.
2993784	3000266	But E3 is going to be like this big fat deal, and we're going to get a lot of Imani news next week, which is interesting because we don't really have a show next Sunday.
3001606	3001946	No.
3002426	3013149	But in two weeks we'll be back with episode number 45, our season 3 premiere, and we will have lots to talk about from E3 because in those two weeks there's going to be so much news it's going to make you cry.
3014090	3015311	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3038155	3040920	I'm going to ask him to record a bunch of the stuff on the Bimani things for me.
3041340	3043584	And Metal Gear Solid 3 is going to be a big thing too.
3043624	3044505	Oh my god, that was cool.
3044626	3046549	Because the trailer's out now.
3046569	3051777	There's also the new Metal Gear Solid for the GameCube that they're coming out with.
3053949	3055730	I don't know why I love my GameCube.
3055890	3059691	My GameCube is my favorite system now, and I would buy that on the GameCube.
3060111	3066272	They said it was like Metal Gear Solid, the first one's story with the second one's graphics.
3067092	3067853	That would be cool.
3068013	3069093	That's what it's supposed to be.
3070433	3072834	I want to know more about that Final Fantasy game they're doing for GameCube.
3072874	3073614	I hope it doesn't suck.
3073694	3074534	Please don't suck.
3074594	3075494	Please don't suck.
3075774	3077175	And Mario Kart Double Dash.
3077375	3077715	Oh, yeah.
3079056	3081078	Squeenix is back with Nintendo.
3081638	3085382	And I bet you they're going to show a lot of Final Fantasy XI stuff at E3.
3086322	3087363	Although it's already out in Japan.
3087543	3088024	You know what?
3088744	3090666	My demo disc needs to hurry up and get to my house.
3091106	3092247	Will you have a demo disc of it coming?
3092708	3093769	Well, I signed up for the beta.
3094449	3094589	Ah.
3095150	3098753	And I'm to be a beta tester for the PC version.
3099754	3104418	And I have a feeling that I'm going to get it because I've at least played every game out except for XI.
3104438	3104498	And...
3109660	3112801	That and I've beta tested a bunch of other stuff, so I'm pretty sure to get it.
3114141	3115382	And Dan signed up for the PS2 one.
3117022	3117322	Cool.
3117622	3129105	I'm just pissed, though, because I was thinking of getting the Japanese one when it came out, except that it would have been really expensive for me, because I would have had to get an external hard drive for my PS2, because I have a first model Japanese one.
3129125	3135627	$200-something dollars still, and I refuse to shop at BuyRite, because they suck.
3136872	3140755	I was telling my friend Garrett about your Buy Right experiences because he thinks they suck too.
3140795	3142176	They did something to him that pissed him off.
3144397	3145478	They really suck a big ass.
3145658	3146859	Never shot from Buy Right.
3146979	3147179	I know.
3147199	3148220	Would you explain this to me?
3148240	3151462	I kind of know what it is, but I thought our listeners might benefit.
3151782	3157066	The difference between, because I know this is your beef with Buy Right, the difference between buying a game that's Asia and buying a game that's Japan.
3157600	3170429	There's really not a difference in the game itself, but when you get your manual, it's going to be written all in, I think it's Mandarin Chinese, as opposed to being written in Japanese.
3171050	3178675	And for me it was a big thing because I would have at least a chance of reading a Japanese manual instead of one written in Chinese.
3179556	3183879	And the other thing is that I could have gone to YesAsia and gotten it for $30 cheaper.
3185456	3188219	Instead, I paid more, and there it went.
3189660	3190440	But I see that a lot.
3190460	3195685	Like, I was looking around at stuff on NCSX the other night, and they have Asia, Japan.
3195705	3198628	They have it pretty clearly defined, the differences between the two when you're buying them.
3198648	3200369	So that's why it's good to shop at NCSX.
3200549	3200729	Yes.
3201370	3205634	But I was just, you know, I was kind of curious what the difference is, and, you know, I thought maybe our listeners could benefit from that, too.
3206314	3207515	They should just never shop from BuyRight.
3207775	3209477	And also, if you sign up for their mailing list at all.
3210057	3212780	Because somehow they signed me up for it when I emailed a question.
3212800	3212880	Okay.
3214240	3216321	I've submitted so many times.
3216661	3218842	Threaten legal action because you can actually sue them for that.
3220603	3221903	And they haven't removed me so I blocked.
3222123	3223924	That's part of the reason why my DarkSakura mail is blocked.
3225045	3233948	But I'm actually going to get on the line one day and call them and tell them that if they do not remove my name for their mailing list that I am going to press charges.
3234509	3234949	And I will.
3235697	3241679	You know, that's going to be a law in California pretty soon about the whole you can sue them for $500 or something like that.
3241699	3242319	It's crazy.
3242679	3246440	And you get $100 of that?
3246640	3248081	I'm sorry, you get the state to give them a fine.
3248101	3250341	The state can fine them for that and you get $100 of that.
3250861	3251422	That's awesome.
3252842	3253822	All the spam lists?
3254082	3254342	Uh-huh.
3254582	3254903	Uh-uh.
3255083	3256463	I'm going to save every last one of them.
3259064	3259564	I'll be rich.
3260037	3263259	C3 and D3 C4 blew up C3
3291167	3301916	B3 is this weekend and that's at Pier 39 in San Francisco.
3302617	3305920	Huge, huge DDR tournament is going to be taking place.
3305940	3308442	There's people coming in from Seattle, SoCal.
3308702	3310223	It's like the... Oh, Jamie's ringing.
3310243	3310824	Jamie's ringing.
3312657	3315638	Anyway, moving on to a discussion about B3.
3316099	3324843	B3 is going to be this huge-ass tournament that's going on, and it's taking place in San Francisco on Pier 39, and they're having four or five competitions.
3324963	3331686	It's Perfect Attack, Freestyle, Dance Maniacs, and B-Mania 3.
3333027	3334287	I think there was something else going on.
3334307	3335308	I probably forgot.
3335508	3339470	But you can get onto DDR Freak and check the official tournament thread for more information on that.
3341508	3347652	and we will be broadcasting to you that weekend on Saturday for sure.
3348433	3350754	Sunday, hopefully, if we can get it to work out.
3350854	3353496	I just received some news we might not be able to get it to work out, but hopefully we do.
3354857	3356778	But we'll be coming to you all day long on Saturday for sure.
3357519	3359760	And we're going to have a really good location from what I understand.
3360221	3363523	Do you want to say anything to the listeners?
3365124	3366205	Wait, wait, one second.
3366225	3367586	Say it one more time on the count of three, okay?
3367826	3368786	One, two, three.
3369347	3369407	Hi.
3373391	3374492	I could barely hear it, yes.
3374912	3376333	Can you say it louder one more time?
3376773	3380235	One, two, wait, wait, Dan, Dan, one more time.
3380835	3382376	One, two, three.
3383396	3385537	Orange Lounge Radio rocks!
3385977	3387278	Very good, very good.
3387298	3388238	Thank you, Dan.
3388298	3388659	I love you.
3388679	3388859	Bye.
3393976	3394817	That was my Dan.
3395257	3396398	That was Jamie's Dan.
3396798	3397979	My microphone's really loud now.
3400021	3400502	Where were we?
3400542	3401703	Yes, B3, all those competitions.
3401723	3404025	We're going to have a really good location Saturday from what I understand.
3404085	3404805	That's going to be awesome.
3405065	3407327	You can't freaking... Are they going to feed us?
3408128	3408428	I don't know.
3408448	3413833	I don't think they're going to feed us, but I hear we get other perks, but I can't say what those are yet, but I'll tell you off air.
3414654	3415454	There's some cool things.
3415634	3417436	So we get free manservants.
3417916	3417976	Oh.
3422980	3423900	We have intern zero.
3423940	3425402	We don't need another manservant.
3425502	3427323	I'm talking about naked menservants.
3428664	3430085	I'm talking about harem men.
3431607	3435450	Well, maybe we can talk puppy or something into being a manservant.
3435510	3437211	I don't want puppy to be a harem man.
3437231	3438352	I want my harem man to...
3445054	3446755	We need to have, like, incest on the trailer.
3447035	3449455	We're the Orange Lounge radio people.
3449495	3450396	We're celebrity staff.
3450416	3452636	We need people coming to our booth asking for autographs.
3452716	3454697	And we go, sorry, no time, no time.
3454737	3455617	See my publicist.
3455657	3455997	Call me.
3456017	3456617	We'll do lunch.
3456697	3457317	Blah, blah, blah.
3457778	3460338	I'm still thinking about auctioning off my bat.
3462999	3463479	At the tournament?
3463499	3465060	Maybe we should auction off my bat at the tournament.
3465220	3467560	Aren't you going to be sad to see that go?
3471922	3472722	Yes, I will.
3474686	3477528	How could I ever consider getting rid of my beloved bat?
3477968	3479149	Dude, they're moving tables now.
3480310	3481271	Bye, neighbors!
3481891	3485573	Oh, we already have people in the chat room claiming dibs on the orange bat.
3485673	3487014	So maybe look forward to that.
3487034	3488655	Maybe we'll do a silent auction for my bat.
3489016	3490136	Are we giving away door prizes?
3491617	3491898	Don't know?
3491918	3492918	Maybe.
3492938	3493479	Hopefully a few.
3493499	3495560	We at least have that one box of stuff, right?
3495640	3501504	The one that you wanted to... I think we should do a silent auction for the orange bat.
3501849	3503431	Okay, so you're thinking about signing an auction for your bat?
3504092	3504912	You should do one for yours.
3505173	3507235	We should auction off your bat too, signed by us.
3508136	3508616	We could do that.
3508657	3509077	The hosts.
3509417	3510559	And then you and I have to go get new bats.
3511400	3513802	Okay, so we'll do it, and then we can enter and do a routine.
3515084	3516405	At the biggest tournament in NorCal.
3516685	3516845	No!
3518030	3521613	Okay, so we're probably going to do a silent auction for Jamie's bat and my bat.
3521633	3522514	So that's something to look forward to.
3522834	3524976	We are going to be giving away some door prizes.
3524996	3526777	We don't know how many, but we're going to be giving away some.
3526817	3527878	So stop by our table.
3528178	3529700	Maybe we'll do like a random drawing or something.
3529720	3532342	Like, come get interviewed on the show and get a ticket in the drawing.
3533803	3534724	Maybe we'll do something like that.
3534744	3535224	That'll be fun.
3535884	3538567	And yeah, so definitely look for us.
3538607	3540808	But except it can't just be come be interviewed on the show.
3540828	3543651	Like, we have to interview them and ask them really humiliating questions.
3545080	3547803	I just remembered that one question on the sex quiz.
3547843	3550726	I'll ask Travis if maybe we can borrow the sex quiz, if he wouldn't mind.
3550746	3553168	Shrimping.
3554689	3555690	Rusty trombone.
3556631	3558673	Take the sex quiz, win a DVD, maybe?
3559314	3559754	Maybe.
3563278	3564939	Take the sex quiz, get spanked by Rob.
3566901	3567442	Bring a paddle.
3568732	3571313	with the heart on the little saddle.
3572454	3575335	Since we'll be in Frisco, you know, a date with Rob in the Castro.
3575615	3576836	That could be a prize.
3577436	3578117	I hate the Castro.
3578797	3581498	There's like one or two good stores there, but the rest of it is dirty.
3581558	3582439	It's a dirty place.
3582819	3583299	It really is.
3583519	3583900	Dirty!
3584320	3584920	It's dirty.
3586061	3586161	Ew.
3586801	3586941	Ew.
3587401	3588902	Why is Jack's head green?
3590423	3590923	I don't get it.
3591363	3593985	Ew.
3594085	3596546	That looks like a big bottle of snot with a hat on it.
3598342	3599182	Puppy had a great idea.
3599242	3601243	We can get Violent Hypergirl to bring her whip again.
3601584	3601824	Ooh!
3602764	3605165	We can see if we can borrow one out of the... What the hell?
3605245	3606066	...cast supply.
3606486	3611829	Creative Labs has every single version of the Sound Blaster listed on their site, except the one I have.
3613529	3614530	What is up with that?
3614790	3619512	They have the basic Sound Blaster Live, and then mine is Sound Blaster Live 5.1, okay?
3619772	3627016	They have Sound Blaster Live 5.1 MP3+, and Sound Blaster Live 5.1 Gamer, but no Sound Blaster... Go to Download.com.
3629955	3633177	I'm going to put my old sound card in because this one sucks ass.
3633477	3637179	My old card never gave me problems and my old motherboard never gave me problems too.
3637719	3638539	Fucking fries.
3639940	3643101	The chat room is suggesting that I cosplay Mr. Spanky for B3.
3643722	3651425	And you know what's scary is I have seen that exact thing that Mr. Spanky wears in a leather store in San Francisco on Folsom Street.
3652606	3653426	So I could go buy it.
3655489	3656390	We'll do an exhibition.
3680370	3681330	Oh, Exhibitionism.
3681430	3682991	Dr. Dick does an Exhibitionism.
3683371	3684551	That's an exciting idea.
3688592	3694514	But I have to find some big fur coat and some shiny shirts and things like that.
3695014	3697335	I'll have to go shopping at some gay stores this week and see what I can find.
3699575	3701176	I should buy my costume at Naughty and Nice.
3705817	3707017	Dr. Dick in Mantis.
3707598	3708938	We'll get you a school uniform.
3709878	3710459	Dead End Dead End
3738795	3740056	We could do it to something like 511.
3741498	3742299	That would be funny.
3742339	3744101	Too bad Flourish for Albion isn't in there.
3744682	3744942	I know.
3745202	3745502	Cry.
3749146	3750388	I've got my addiction back.
3751629	3751829	What?
3751989	3753451	Ragnarok Online is free once more.
3753892	3754112	Is it?
3755535	3758357	I think I see Justin in our chat room has been playing that a lot too.
3758538	3759839	Yeah, he's in my party.
3760279	3760639	Oh, cool.
3761200	3767065	I've been helping him gain levels because I am so happy because I have a plus five stiletto now.
3767965	3768966	And that means in English?
3769126	3771708	That means I can kill things faster and have them kill me less.
3773910	3774230	Cool.
3774971	3778974	If there was this one critter, it would take me a whole life bar to kill and now I can kill five of them.
3780235	3780756	Very nice.
3780816	3781536	Congratulations.
3782317	3782857	I'm a nerd.
3784512	3785953	and so on.
3806363	3811833	So we thought we'd talk to you, we thought Loki and I would talk to you about what we've seen on G4, what's cool and what sucks.
3812253	3816701	Okay, what's cool, first off, best show on all of G4, Starrcade.
3817302	3818324	Starrcade rocks.
3819225	3826768	Old School Game Show from 83, where they play video games like Pac-Man and Pango and Pole Position, and they win video games.
3827028	3827969	They win arcade machines.
3828029	3829609	Hands down the best show on G4.
3830090	3832391	Okay, now what sucks about G4, Loki?
3833291	3835772	Well, actually, there's one more good show on there.
3836152	3842014	It's called Electric Play or something like that.
3842094	3843895	It's where they review only action games.
3843955	3844616	It's pretty cool.
3845016	3847757	They do these little skit things that are kind of funny.
3847777	3848217	Oh, yeah.
3848477	3850318	Those are mildly entertaining.
3851298	3858300	Now, what really sucks, this one show, Portal, is the gayest show I've ever seen.
3858781	3862542	Seriously, this guy that looks like... Wait a minute, gayer than queerest folk?
3863208	3864208	Yes, it's pretty bad.
3864909	3872772	It's like, okay, this guy is like, I would say he's pretty much like the gamer version of Blue's Clues.
3873252	3881896	Okay, this guy is just sitting there talking to nobody, except for this imaginary computer thing that's supposedly in the studio that talks to him about...
3882356	3907282	really stupid things and they're making it sound all high-tech and cool and all he does is he talks about different like cities and towns and stuff they're in online games then they do this stupid little like skit where they have these people walking around or whatever in like online games and they're like making them talk you know dubbing over their voices and doing little stories it's really retarded it is just dumb it's damn awful
3909344	3910146	Yeah, that game sucks.
3910166	3910707	Dumbass.
3922168	3922568	Nick Arcade
3939983	3950994	Yeah, and also what really sucks is they've got these stupid commercials where they show the Twin Galaxies world records for like these two games.
3951495	3951895	Two games.
3951915	3957200	They have like, that's old school Orange Lounge topics right there talking about Twin Galaxies and their old DDR...
3957941	3958581	What was number one?
3958621	3959522	Legend of Zelda
3977483	3978364	I forget what number two was.
3978444	3979345	It was another series.
3979365	3980425	Guardian Legend was better.
3980445	3981005	Another series.
3981186	3982406	Guardian Legend wasn't on the list.
3983327	3984347	Those bastards.
3985148	3985548	At all.
3986008	3986549	Was E.T.
3986669	3986929	on there?
3987910	3988210	No.
3988350	3991211	What about Custer's Revenge?
3991972	3992192	No.
3993213	3994153	No, what else?
3995034	3997795	There was a few that were really stupid that beat up other ones.
3999356	4001057	Grand Theft Auto was under...
4003587	4004107	I can't remember.
4004127	4006368	There's just a lot of really dumb games on the list.
4006388	4008209	Maybe I could find that list online somewhere.
4009370	4010390	Maybe it's on G4.
4010971	4011751	I'll see if I can find it.
4012231	4014232	Keep talking about G4 while I look for this list.
4014292	4023077	Then they have these stupid intimate moments with Lara Croft where there's this guy talking to her and it's just really retarded.
4023557	4028499	I mean, this guy is talking to this chick that's supposedly next to him and he's not making a play at all.
4028900	4029720	I mean, what a loser.
4030000	4030701	There's going to be some...
4031621	4047933	You know, intimate moments, I wanna see some intimate moments, I wanna see this, hi, don't you hate it that people think that, you know, you're unintelligent and stuff, da da da da da, he should be like, bitch, get down on my lap, you know, stuff like that, cause I mean, I don't know, it's just really awful.
4048653	4061678	Really awful TV, and then they have these stupid screenshots they do of different games and stuff, and that was awful, and it's programmed cheats, it gives you codes for games that are way old, and it's just a lot of waste of TV.
4062918	4070861	No, one thing I think is pretty good is that Judgment Day one, because I like the one dude who's just got a total jackass attitude towards every game, even if it's good, he's like a total prick about it.
4071461	4100320	and that other guy said to their well no actually I thought it was a pretty good game is all no this game is the crap and just starts going off on them without cussing them out it's pretty good you know I can't find a list of that top 100 games of all time but that whole thing is on tonight and it starts at 9.30 with part 1 see then you gotta watch it no if you if you just watch the last episode they basically cover everything that was on there so just watch the last episode screw the rest filter's pretty good too
4103044	4108906	So, we've talked about G4, we talked about B3, and we talked about E3, so that's everything we said we'd talk about, yes?
4109847	4112548	It's all the letter number combinations that we need.
4113188	4113388	Yes.
4114548	4115869	Are you about to fall asleep, Jamie?
4117745	4118786	We need to do fuck you's of the week.
4118966	4121267	Do you want to do the cage match now or do you want to do fuck you's now?
4122307	4122487	Huh?
4123188	4125329	You want to do fuck... Excuse you!
4125349	4126169	I'm just kidding.
4126750	4129111	We'll take a quick break and we'll come back and do the fuck you's of the week.
4129511	4131992	So why don't you go ahead and send those to me in the chat room.
4132052	4133033	Hello, I'm Sky.
4133073	4134374	I'm sitting in the chat room right now.
4135014	4135194	Huh?
4136275	4136775	Play Angry Thing.
4136795	4140817	I'm going to play some... I'm going to play... Wait.
4141177	4142698	There's quite a difference between those.
4144059	4145339	Jamie says play show tunes.
4145419	4146580	What songs are show tune-ish?
4149753	4151914	My god, I don't know what songs those are.
4151954	4152874	Can I play angry songs?
4152894	4153854	I can find those easier.
4154915	4157395	Okay, I have to... Play all tack?
4159016	4160276	Alright, we'll take a tack break.
4163037	4164097	We'll take a tic-tac break.
4166538	4167558	And then we'll be back.
4168779	4169599	Yes, we will.
4169639	4171199	I have to find some tack stuff first.
4171219	4171560	Hold on.
4173140	4173680	Okay, yes.
4173940	4176041	We're going to play some tack, and then we'll be back.
4176101	4177361	So send those FUs to me.
4177761	4178062	I'm Skye.
4179862	4180583	Tag and bet.
4181003	4182383	I'm in the chat room as Sky.
4183204	4185965	If you aren't in our chat room, you should be.
4186285	4187046	Get your ass over there.
4187346	4194270	Go over to www.calibermani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and then click on Chat.
4194650	4198112	And while you're at calibermani.com, visit our forums.
4198292	4198592	What?
4198672	4199552	You said chat.
4199752	4200373	Maybe I did.
4202754	4204495	Can we have a little clip of the AMIX one more time?
4204895	4205756	Loki, just a little clip.
4205896	4206376	Just a little bit.
4211909	4212289	Beautiful.
4213170	4213371	What?
4214392	4214752	New one?
4219237	4220418	Okay, okay, you're lame.
4221259	4223421	Alright, we'll be back after this quick break.
4223441	4225703	Send me your FUs of the week and we'll read those.
4226644	4228186	Oh yeah, we forgot to talk about Pump It Up.
4228326	4229487	I guess we'll do that later too.
4229808	4230889	Pump It Up is Korean.
4232472	4232812	We'll be back.
4232832	4233913	We'll talk about Pompadour a little later.
4235854	4237835	We're teasing it so that you have to keep listening.
4238615	4240696	Quit playing crap so I can play the break music.
4241976	4242737	We'll be back.
4244458	4245638	What the fuck is this?
4247259	4247939	Um, what's this?
4248839	4249200	Stoic.
4249520	4249620	Oh.
4343908	4350481	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
4374302	4375733	Thanks for watching!
4419847	4421011	Thank you for watching!
4567273	4571337	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
4571597	4572157	Extreme Bobani Radio.
4572177	4572498	That's us.
4572518	4573318	Orange Lounge Radio.
4595086	4596226	Hi, we are back now.
4596266	4597067	Whoops, sorry about that.
4598287	4599768	We're having some technical difficulties there.
4600128	4602989	Loki and I are trying to share our computers here, and it's fucking things up.
4604489	4605010	But we're back.
4607110	4607551	Yay!
4607891	4608251	Yay.
4609751	4611052	I'm so excited that we're back.
4611352	4613433	I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it.
4614473	4614933	Let's see.
4616454	4619355	Jamie, let's talk about Pump It Up, because Sharon wanted us to talk about Pump It Up.
4619375	4619655	It's Korean.
4619675	4620775	We haven't in a while.
4621016	4621536	It's Korean.
4621556	4621956	What do you think?
4621996	4622396	Do you like it?
4622416	4622876	Do you hate it?
4623556	4624737	I like it, but it's Korean.
4625450	4625990	What's that mean?
4626430	4627011	It's Korean.
4628191	4628531	Okay.
4628631	4630912	I hated the version that was at New York, New York.
4631352	4632132	It was in Vegas.
4632172	4632672	Oh my god.
4633513	4636254	Well, first of all, the stage was so messed up.
4637554	4641295	It kept going past the song I wanted because every time you stepped on it, it would hit two.
4641515	4643056	And there were like a bajillion songs in the game.
4643076	4644596	It was like one of the last ones out.
4645437	4647757	And then I couldn't find the songs I wanted.
4647797	4649178	It took me forever to find Run To You.
4650058	4652319	and then it would automatically put you into another difficulty.
4652379	4652859	It sucked.
4653359	4654400	But I mean, I like Pump It Up, though.
4654760	4656120	I hate playing Caution on Pump It Up, though.
4656980	4659281	Because it's so slow.
4660702	4664443	My thoughts on Pump It Up, I absolutely hated the game when I first played it, and I'll tell you why.
4665303	4666864	The interface sucks.
4667504	4683818	on all versions because they don't you have to use your feet to move around it's too slow I mean I like on DDR you can really fastly throw through the songs even on fourth mix you can move through the songs a hell of a lot faster than you can and pump it up and that just pisses me off I shouldn't have to stand there for five minutes trying to select my song I know you can
4684935	4685836	I mean, so whatever.
4685936	4688017	But other than that, it's alright.
4688077	4689798	I mean, the videos in the back are pretty cool.
4689818	4691378	The one to take on me was the best.
4691839	4693099	Some of the songs are pretty cool.
4693199	4696281	I really like some of the songs in Pump It Up.
4696301	4697102	I like the big screen.
4697382	4703125	I think it takes a lot of crap, but its really horrible interface hurts it a lot more than it really should.
4703545	4707427	I think a lot of people are just turned off by the... it's just not easy to use.
4709028	4710909	Imagine if we had DVR on a big screen like that.
4715228	4715829	It'd be pretty.
4718372	4718892	No, it doesn't.
4720494	4721515	Pump It Up does not suck.
4721956	4723337	Why do you think Pump It Up sucks, Zero?
4725880	4726120	Well...
4728328	4732949	Well, one reason why I think it absolutely sucks is the interface does suck.
4734210	4738271	I mean, I can play this, I can play the game, and there's a couple good songs that I like.
4738831	4744953	When half the other songs are trash, the damn thing takes forever to load after a song.
4744993	4750375	I gotta stand there for 45 seconds just to take 30 seconds to pick a song.
4751315	4756118	I don't really like playing diagonal instead of up and down, left and right.
4756138	4756658	You know what, though?
4756678	4760640	The diagonal thing, for some reason, it makes freestyling a lot more natural.
4760720	4762001	Because it makes you freestyle.
4762081	4763302	Yeah, but I think that's kind of cool.
4763342	4764802	That's one thing I like about Pump It Up.
4765203	4766043	Yeah, I think that's the point.
4767044	4777069	I mean, I think DDR could actually use maybe some type of the style of the videos that are in Pump It Up on some.
4777589	4780271	And there's some that are horrible, but I think that there's a lot of...
4781071	4782873	Ideas DDR can take from Pump?
4783173	4785054	Same thing would Pump could take from DDR.
4785935	4796043	Like, yeah, having just an easier interface, being able to choose your songs quicker, and possibly changing their hardware so that you don't have to stand around for a month.
4796383	4798745	Isn't a Pump It Up machine just a big computer inside that box?
4799166	4799846	That's what I heard.
4799946	4800947	It's just a big PC in there.
4801267	4803549	They could have changed that if they really wanted to.
4803930	4805611	Would have been a little bit easier for everyone else.
4807219	4808382	I've played a game that's worse, though.
4809324	4809624	What?
4809685	4810586	God, I can't remember the name of it.
4810607	4811388	It was put out by Jaleco.
4812313	4812853	Technomotion?
4813133	4813854	Not Technomotion.
4814234	4817876	No, what it is, they have one at this bowling alley I went to in Hayward.
4818716	4821637	But it's got three monitors.
4821998	4825539	The middle monitor is the videos, and it looks like one of those make-your-own-video things.
4826260	4826660	Huh.
4826740	4829241	Where people are doing really crappy dances and wearing really crappy clothes.
4829321	4834664	But it's got, like, you know how Samba de Amigo, how your maraca places are set up?
4835104	4836384	Well, it's like that on the floor.
4837005	4839606	And you do your steps like that, and there are different colors that tells you where to go.
4841713	4842975	God, what's that game called?
4843475	4845818	It's by Jaleco.
4847139	4847660	Do a search.
4848260	4848661	Weird.
4849081	4849762	Do a search real quick.
4850363	4852845	Hold on just a sec because I'm queuing up some other stuff for later in the show.
4855668	4856930	I missed playing Technomotion.
4857190	4858251	They have one at Excalibur.
4858571	4859272	I missed playing it.
4862252	4864594	Thank you for bringing that up, Loki.
4865714	4871338	What's cooler than Pump It Up is the game that the same company made called Dance Station 3DDX.
4871438	4872018	And Amiro?
4872559	4874220	Yeah, and Amiro.
4874800	4879583	The way it looks is so cool because instead of the arrows that are set in...
4880922	4883724	You know how the buttons are kind of sunk into the pad a little bit?
4884044	4894550	Well, the way 3DDX is, and the same thing with Easy To Dancer, is it's a big black panel that's over the whole thing, and then different areas of it light up, so it's a big flat panel.
4894891	4898653	So it kind of makes finding the buttons a little harder, but it kind of adds to the challenge of the game.
4899153	4904737	Well, in 3DDX, not only that, but there's para-like sensors all around the sides, so you have to wave your arms, too, to play.
4905077	4905597	It's awesome.
4906438	4908519	And it has such songs as Jenny in a Bottle...
4911038	4912638	That game makes you freestyle.
4912859	4914159	I gotta adjust the volume on this one.
4914439	4916039	Yes, that game makes you freestyle.
4916660	4917660	I don't talk very loud.
4919080	4921441	Here, look, if you want to... You can use this one, Loki.
4923281	4924062	Don't change it too much.
4926202	4927222	What was I looking for?
4927482	4927803	Shoot.
4928163	4929323	Hey, they're number one in Italy.
4933924	4936065	Okay, so are we about ready for the FUs of the week?
4936505	4936765	Sure.
4937525	4937965	Why not?
4938045	4938625	Here we go.
4939466	4940266	Jamie, you know what to do.
4956351	4958493	My first one, my first F.U.
4958513	4962617	of the week goes to being tired and not sleeping.
4964038	4969583	My other one goes toward my poor, poor body for being sore after Rocky last night.
4971264	4974267	And, I don't know, I'm not really all that angsty.
4975468	4975968	Gasp.
4977189	4982694	Well, there's the usual, like, the idiot drivers and driving here to do the show.
4984072	4987476	I'm driving to South Sac and went up here.
4987797	4988657	Love you, Jamie.
4988978	4990099	He got me food, so he's forgiven.
4991681	4995205	I was teasing anyway.
4995605	5002593	One of them goes to, well, I love my fiance a whole lot, but he ate a whole box of live cereal and I didn't get any.
5004170	5005170	Was it Cinnamon Life?
5005230	5006431	Because Cinnamon Life is the best.
5006471	5007551	Cinnamon Life sucks.
5007591	5008231	It's normal.
5008351	5010952	If he ate the whole box of Cinnamon Life, that is a crime.
5010972	5011212	That's okay.
5011252	5012292	I found another box, though.
5012612	5013873	Because I bought the other two for five.
5014193	5014973	Cinnamon Life is the best.
5015013	5015893	I hate Cinnamon Life.
5015913	5016834	I hate Cinnamon Life.
5016854	5018614	What is wrong with you?
5018634	5019034	Normal.
5019554	5020075	Thank you.
5020235	5021995	Cinnamon Life tastes like shit.
5023376	5024136	I like the normal one.
5024616	5026897	I don't like oddly flavored cereals.
5027017	5028677	I like Cracklin' Oat Bran.
5028697	5029097	I'll put it that way.
5029117	5029837	I like Grape Nuts.
5030718	5031338	I like Total.
5032742	5034464	When I was a little kid, I ate adult cereals.
5034584	5035585	And I hate marshmallows.
5036106	5037287	Fuck marshmallows, okay?
5037327	5038028	Because they're nasty.
5039109	5042672	And, um... I guess that's it.
5043413	5043814	Yeah.
5043954	5044534	I'm tired.
5044554	5045355	Fuck being tired.
5046456	5046797	Blech.
5048399	5048739	Next.
5049360	5052343	Let's move on to Loki, although I'm very scared because he made a list.
5058253	5058693	Cool.
5059794	5061055	I still think this thing is too loud.
5061075	5065499	Anyways, um... I know.
5065919	5066160	Okay.
5066780	5076809	Um, see, first FU is gonna go to my sound card, because while it being new, it skips when I play stuff, as you heard earlier with that exclusive remix.
5077310	5077370	Um...
5078854	5079915	I don't know what's wrong with it.
5080575	5090780	It's pissing me off because I'm looking on their site to find drivers and they don't have any drivers for this car because the car doesn't exist according to their site, which is also really annoying.
5090960	5093561	So I have to find drivers for this somewhere.
5093581	5095242	I'm thinking that's probably what the problem is for it.
5095782	5097363	So I have you in my sound card because it sucks.
5098163	5104647	Also, since we're on the subject of that, I have you in my motherboard because, you know, I got this nice motherboard and processor combo.
5104667	5105968	It's supposed to be an AMD 2200.
5106068	5110030	Well, it's supposed to be, you know, running about, you know, 2 gigahertz or whatever.
5110070	5111191	It's running at 135.
5113072	5115073	My old processor was faster than that.
5115413	5120416	So I basically paid $300, or no, $150 for a downgrade.
5122177	5122917	Thank you, Fries.
5123197	5124058	You can suck ass.
5126195	5129079	Let's see here, let's also talk about old people.
5130440	5133684	I had an encounter with this really old bag that was
5135362	5156079	at the, at release, and I was just waiting in line to get some, you know, Chinese food, and she's pushing her car, oh, I'm, oh, cutting right in front of us, and then stupid Chinese lady, what's happened, she freaking, you know, goes, and talks, what do you want, what do you want, what do you want,
5160053	5180151	And so, I'm sitting here going, yeah, I guess we don't need lines, and this stupid bitch in front of me started saying, well, and I just totally tuned her out then, and I was just like, okay, not talking to you because you're ugly, and then, um,
5180911	5189320	So, you know, F you this stupid old bitch because she didn't even know what she wanted and here I'm just waiting here going, come on, come on, come on, come on, move, move, move, move, come on, come on, come on, you're old, come on, move.
5189780	5194044	So, wasted like a good extra half an hour than I really needed.
5195406	5200491	Yeah, so now, um, also, and F you to, um, stupid drivers.
5201801	5210728	Goddammit, there's this road down here and everyone backs up because they want no turn, because they backs up a good, like, you know, half a mile, so people want a turn.
5211089	5214171	Well, these stupid people don't really, oh, I have to get in that lane to turn?
5214191	5216113	Is that why all the people are there?
5216373	5220896	So they stop in the middle of your lane trying to turn over and won't move out of the way.
5221937	5227362	Then I had another jackass when I went to McDonald's yesterday who was checking his food in the middle of the parking lot.
5228308	5229289	Direct middle of the parking lot.
5229309	5231110	I couldn't go around him because he was sitting in the way.
5231150	5237354	And he was just kind of going, I just got my stupid hamburger.
5238095	5239676	So, F you that.
5240796	5243638	F you to the people on Ain't It Cool News for giving away the ending of The Matrix.
5243658	5248081	They keep trying to read reviews on stuff, and they keep giving away the ending of The Matrix, and it's like sneaking up on me.
5248121	5251063	I keep finding out more stuff I don't want to know about it, and it's really annoying.
5251083	5257868	But I only have four more days until I get to go see the movie, which reminds me, my girlfriend doesn't really want to go, so I have an extra ticket if anyone wants to go with me.
5260256	5260496	Okay.
5261537	5261857	We'll see.
5264079	5267301	Um, uh, let's see here, and... It's at 545.
5267881	5268562	That's the only thing.
5268582	5269803	You have to run over there.
5269983	5270503	Oh, that's cool.
5270883	5271124	Okay.
5271604	5275767	Um, and then, uh, F you to my website, cause it's gone.
5276943	5277783	It's gone for good.
5278064	5278484	Bye-bye.
5278744	5279244	No site.
5279524	5279944	It's gone.
5280124	5284406	My hosting died, and I'm not gonna pay for hosting, and it saves me time that way.
5284907	5286307	So I don't have to work on my website anymore.
5286827	5287168	It's gone.
5287448	5287808	So what?
5288008	5288708	Um, and guess what?
5288748	5294451	You know, you can just find your stupid files anywhere else on the web, because I'm not responsible for doing your searching for you.
5294911	5299053	I don't give a shit anymore, you know, because you don't do anything, you don't help me out, so, um...
5300387	5301428	You can consider it bastard.
5301448	5305150	You can go ahead and find your files on the web like I do and spend time like I do.
5305750	5306371	And you know what?
5306431	5307231	It builds character.
5307572	5309072	You know, the hard work.
5309092	5309973	It builds character.
5311014	5311514	The hard work.
5311554	5318218	So if you want a huge sim collection like mine, you can go suck ass because you're never going to find it because most files are off the internet.
5318498	5318999	So ha!
5319339	5319959	I laugh at you.
5320380	5322021	I have a large collection and you do.
5322041	5323702	I have a large collection and you do.
5323722	5325283	So, yeah.
5326604	5326924	And, um...
5330669	5331450	Yeah, I have Asian porn.
5331470	5332071	Yeah, that's cool.
5332231	5336035	But, um... Yeah, I think it's Asian porn because it's censored.
5336276	5336716	That sucks.
5336756	5339179	They have hot Asian chicks in there, like, all blocky.
5339500	5341021	Looks like a mosaic is attacking them.
5341542	5342083	That's not cool.
5344418	5348980	What do you have to say to those that say that the point of Leech from Loki is to, in fact, Leech from Loki?
5370566	5377139	The point is that I left space for people to put files up so that people can leech from my site but no one put any files up.
5377600	5378341	And for that you must die.
5379053	5379693	For that, you must die.
5380034	5387657	And I know the whole purpose of the GIF files, but really all the files I had on there I got from DDRUK anyways, so go get them from them.
5388178	5389758	Shit, this is like... What?
5390519	5393941	Seriously, Bomani Sims at DDRUK is pretty much where I got all my files.
5393961	5396142	There wasn't anything new on there yet.
5396262	5398683	I mean, I was planning on it, I just never got around to it.
5399203	5401224	So now I have more time to make cool files.
5401344	5405346	I mean, you should think of it as an advantage, because you get to see my files anyways.
5405366	5406267	You have more time to remix.
5407645	5410386	Yeah, well, yeah, if the sound card works.
5410686	5411126	Okay, I'm done.
5411786	5413327	Alright, you're done.
5413607	5414027	My turn.
5416248	5416708	Let me think.
5416988	5418249	What are some things I want to give an FU to?
5418629	5425031	My first FU goes to my erratic sleeping schedule because I was a half hour late to work on Friday because I overslept.
5425431	5425991	That sucks.
5426331	5431213	But what's funny is that was the very last day of my old job because I just got a promotion at work so I started a new job tomorrow.
5431673	5437035	But on Friday I was a half hour late and that really doesn't look good to show up a half hour late your last day.
5438999	5439319	No.
5439459	5439700	Oops.
5440320	5442222	And then I slept 12 hours last night.
5442262	5443363	That was exciting.
5443923	5444904	So an F you to that.
5444984	5445925	For me being lazy.
5447446	5448827	Yeah, I guess that's my F you.
5449648	5450789	God, I'm such an asshole.
5451810	5454692	F you to Loki, because he was a real dick in that last F you of the week.
5458135	5458635	You know what?
5459016	5459256	What?
5459436	5460897	I'd be less of a dick if...
5462122	5462242	No.
5462562	5464164	If your roommate wasn't such a prick, what?
5464944	5466986	My roommate cleaned up after him sometimes.
5467166	5467866	Hey, hey, hey.
5467886	5468987	I don't like where you're going with that.
5469287	5470108	No, hey, honestly.
5470128	5474111	I don't understand how... Not the nitpick or anything, but... Oh, dear.
5474191	5477253	What the hell do you do in the bathroom that gets water all over the counter?
5477273	5480475	I mean, I swear, like, I pick up my stuff on the counter and it's, like, floating.
5481116	5482657	I'm like, shit, man.
5482857	5483938	I have no idea.
5483958	5485198	I'll keep track of that.
5485278	5485859	Okay.
5485919	5486800	Probably shaving.
5487720	5489902	Actually, I have that problem with Dan.
5490990	5496936	because after he gets out of the bathroom for some reason there's an inch of water on the floor and an inch of water on the sink
5497935	5499855	and I have to grab toilet paper and wipe down the sink.
5500516	5510077	That's why in my bathroom, even if I get a little bit lax with cleaning off the counter, there's always this spotless ring around the sink from where I've wiped off the pools of water.
5510878	5513478	And it's like, ugh.
5513958	5514898	Rob, you need to clean up.
5514998	5515999	It's probably from shaving.
5516199	5518899	And I probably just don't notice it because I'm in such a hurry in the morning.
5519099	5521200	But I will try to be more conscious of it in the future.
5521860	5525280	I'm going to get you dust wipes and an electric static duster.
5526001	5526401	For what?
5526741	5527701	For your computer area.
5535548	5544350	I can go to the dollar store and get you an electrostatic duster What else do I have in FU2?
5544430	5551972	FU2, not getting laid in a long long time, that really sucks And I guess that's it
5553852	5556193	There was Jamie's little frown face for me, thank you.
5556893	5558734	Her little unsympathetic loud face.
5559074	5559894	I found out something.
5560475	5560675	What?
5560695	5565897	The girl who was the Onee-san in Battle Royale, she's the voice actor for Asuka in Evangelion.
5567937	5568357	Wonderful.
5569158	5570758	Your useless trivia fact of the day.
5573439	5577741	I was hoping you'd say that she's like a porn star or something, but, you know, that totally threw me off.
5582901	5584062	Yeah, let's move on.
5584802	5586102	Zero, do you have any FUs today?
5587683	5592345	Um, mine pretty much stem from my little trip to Rain World on Friday.
5593046	5594246	These were actually pretty good, too.
5594786	5598228	Um, one, I was wearing a new shirt, actually the one I got now.
5598788	5605931	And for those of you who can't read it, it says, um, warning, the person wearing this, um, shirt has been known to make a pass at almost anyone.
5606672	5609493	If I don't hit on you, there is only one explanation, you ugly.
5610319	5619906	So, um, I go, I'm standing in line after, uh, just waiting to get on a ride, and this lady starts smoking in front of me, right?
5620006	5625670	And I'm sitting here thinking, first of all, we are in an enclosed area, which means you're not supposed to be smoking.
5625690	5627371	And I didn't say that, I just kept to myself.
5628051	5632654	And then I told my, uh, my friends who were with me, I said, you know, this is, like, really annoying.
5633035	5639259	And she turns around and, like, screams at me, I don't give a fuck, I can smoke all the fuck I want, blah blah blah.
5640526	5643348	And I said, okay, that's great, I'll just... Actually, no, she can't.
5643528	5645469	I know she can't because she's in an enclosed area.
5646269	5652272	And, um, and there's a security guard sitting next to me, and I told him, and he told her to put it out, and she wouldn't put it out.
5652372	5655834	And then she decided to yell at me about my shirt and saying, what, am I not attractive?
5655874	5657155	And I looked at her and I said, no.
5658095	5661657	And she was all, your shirt's very offensive, and I said, your smoking's very offensive.
5662157	5664679	And all your little running around bratty-ass kids are offensive.
5666147	5672990	And your face is offensive at that point in which you decided to try to storm on me and then the security guards grabbed her and ejected her from the park.
5674111	5675391	That is how you do it!
5676512	5686356	And, uh... No, and then I have to say fuck you to all the people at Marine World who can't obviously run a fucking ride right.
5686776	5690298	Every time something comes in, oh, we're having technical difficulties, so you're gonna have to wait for another 45 minutes.
5692486	5694267	They need, like, pot-smoking Cartys.
5694748	5700873	And once you, like, do crank and... The Cartys will make a ride work if it doesn't work.
5701433	5702714	They don't care, they'll put you on it.
5703395	5713303	But, so yeah, I ended up spending, like, two hours in this one line waiting for a stupid ride, and I was, like, two cars just waiting to go, and I ended up standing there just because I didn't really want to walk and wait in another line.
5714321	5717663	Um, but still, fuck you to them for being assholes when you ask them what's wrong.
5717683	5720785	They're like, I don't know, I just pushed the buttons.
5721565	5722426	Stupid bastards.
5723046	5726108	And then, um, fuck you to the people... What the hell?
5726768	5727129	They're right.
5727309	5732232	Anyways, fuck you to the people who said that all... Apparently, we up in Sacramento are all known...
5733052	5734693	to absolutely suck at DDR.
5734973	5736114	We're the worst DDR.
5736234	5738795	Yeah, we're the worst DDR players in the world, okay?
5738835	5740536	Because other people say it, it's true.
5740916	5749021	Well, I know, but they decided to try to tell me this as I go down there and I mess around on the fourth bus machine, which works perfectly, that's the best place ever.
5749321	5753943	Yeah, I mean, I'm thinking, what, March Madness, what, three or four of the top 16 were from Sacramento?
5754184	5755064	Yeah, we suck.
5755124	5757145	We're the worst in the world, don't worry.
5757185	5761407	So anyways, they decide to come up to me, oh, where do you play at?
5761427	5763088	And I said, I'm from up in Sacramento and all.
5763128	5764429	You guys suck, and I'm like...
5765149	5765789	Okay, whatever.
5766009	5771071	And then they're like, you know, I'm from LA, this other guy's from over here, and we all hang out all the time.
5771572	5772752	And I'm like, okay, that's great.
5772852	5773933	No, well, how good are you?
5774153	5775733	I'm like, I'm okay, I guess.
5776614	5784557	And they're all, oh, well, this is our best player over here, some little 16-year-old friggin' pimply-faced bastard.
5785477	5787618	And they're all, well, let's have a dance-off.
5787658	5789159	And I'm like, what?
5789419	5793601	First off, first off, first off, anyone that calls it a dance-off...
5795001	5798042	Okay, you should have known right there that... Well, yeah.
5798343	5800644	Okay, I mean, I'm gonna say... I need not say no more.
5800884	5802584	The kid was pretty good, I guess.
5802645	5811028	I mean, he did play really well, but I mean, for them to sit there and just tell me, just get done telling me how much I suck, and then want to challenge me.
5811048	5812109	Because of where you're from.
5812349	5812769	Yeah, you know.
5812789	5814190	Not because they've never seen you play.
5814450	5815470	Just because of where you're from.
5815610	5820893	And not to mention, their extremes sucked at that point, because the unlocks were up to sync, and that was it.
5820953	5823154	So none of the really good songs had been unlocked.
5823962	5830514	And then, um, so they said, alright, we do best two out of three games, and blah blah, I'm like, fine, alright.
5831576	5847449	So, we did the first two rounds, the first two games were PA, and surprisingly I beat them, because I never thought I was that good at PA, and I beat them by like a pretty big margin, and then the second round we just went for I guess the overall score of all three songs, and um, huh?
5848369	5859478	Basically, yeah, but, I mean there was some stupid little thing they said, and I said alright fine, and then I beat them, and then they were all pissed off because I won, and you know, I'm from Sacramento,
5860459	5866261	And then I came back later, because the guy was going to put in the unlock code, and he did, and Legend of Max is there, and I just wanted to play it.
5867141	5869642	And then, of course, you know, the happy little winners are there again.
5870142	5871942	And they're all, can you beat Legend of Max?
5872003	5875143	I said, I'd beat it like, maybe 2 out of 18, 20 tries.
5875504	5875764	No.
5876324	5879105	Okay, um, well he can beat it all the time, why don't you challenge him?
5879345	5883186	I'm like, why would you, basically, why would you want to challenge me if I'm so inferior to him?
5883806	5899135	I'll just do it, and I beat it, I think it was like with a C or a D, and he failed it miserably before the freeze, before like the first main freeze, teehee, and they started like telling me magically how good I was and everything, and I said, yeah, all of the Sacramento players are, and I left.
5900796	5902677	So, I had a good FU to them.
5902698	5903338	Yay, zero.
5904018	5904819	I'd have been like, you know.
5905871	5911373	Like, you know, oh yeah, I could beat, uh, you know, I could beat A on Oni, I could beat that on doubles Oni.
5912353	5914733	Oh, I play better doubles than you do.
5915854	5932898	It was funny when they tried to do, um, doubles, because there was a broom right there where they could have wiped off the machine, and so they didn't, and I watched, like, all three of them try to play doubles and slide right off the side of the machine onto the fourth plus off of the extreme, because they were just too stupid to clean up, and I got up there...
5935942	5942646	Neither of them have memory slots, but it is still a fourth plus though, which was nice because it was fun to play.
5943147	5950351	But it's just, you know, if you're going to come up and say people suck and you think they're so bad, don't challenge them to play because they might be better than you.
5951352	5954113	And an F you with a moral, I like that.
5954554	5956155	Yes, this match has been brought to you by Zero.
5956695	5958656	Worthless information and kind words for all.
5960700	5963923	and, yeah, so, fuck them, fuck Marine World, dude, that place is shitty.
5964343	5968447	I wanna go back to Six Flags of Magic Mountain where the roller coasters actually worked and it was fun.
5969207	5973091	So, fuck Vallejo and shit like that and their stupid crap.
5974512	5975753	I'm done because it sucks.
5975893	5978455	Oh, yeah, fuck the government, too, because they're just stupid.
5979917	5980677	I don't wanna get into it.
5980757	5981078	Alright.
5981978	5982579	Moving on.
5983460	5985061	Let's talk to the chatroom.
5985481	5985662	No.
5986222	5987083	Hello, chatroom.
5988715	5992137	Black Lab would like to give FUs to fucking migraines.
5992237	5993497	They always ruin things for me.
5993717	5995238	I would have been at Rocky last night.
5995898	5996659	Fuck Easy Mac.
5996679	5997539	I'm sick of it already.
5997579	6002781	There would be more, but my roommate finally moved out, and I have the room to myself for the next five weeks, and that makes me happy.
6006323	6011525	Stapler X would like to say FU to annoying bitches who can't stay quiet in a fucking screening room.
6011965	6012966	And, of course, the president.
6014406	6016627	No reason given, just FU.
6019758	6025784	DarkDeadSui would like to say, fuck having to wait for E3 and the official footage of MGS3, Metal Gear Solid 3.
6027225	6033010	Also, he would like to give a suggestion that perhaps the game you were thinking about earlier, Jamie, Stepping Selection or Stepping Stage.
6033351	6035252	Stepping Selection, that game sucks.
6036193	6036894	Well, there you have it.
6037855	6038495	It's funny, though.
6040217	6042559	Rice, RYC3, would like to say, yes?
6042839	6044401	It had that Samantha Fox song in it.
6045248	6045668	Oh, really?
6045748	6046069	Cool.
6046129	6047769	We put into circulation.
6047990	6049250	I mean, oh, the Santa Maria?
6049510	6049751	Yeah.
6049771	6050431	Santa Maria.
6050491	6050871	Oh, that's cool.
6050891	6051351	It had that song.
6051592	6051832	Neat.
6053313	6055874	Rice would like to say, Fuck you to the obnoxious lady at work.
6056034	6056975	God, you were annoying.
6057135	6059756	Fuck you to stupid bitches at Sherman Oaks Castle Park.
6060156	6062478	Fuck you to people who take my sarcasm lively.
6063258	6064118	I think he meant literally.
6064559	6064879	I don't know.
6065699	6067000	Well, maybe he meant lively.
6067080	6067640	I can see that.
6067660	6068801	That's a workable adjective.
6069782	6070782	Sarcasm.
6071362	6073183	Fuck you to people who take my sarcasm lively.
6073244	6073704	Hi, guys.
6075137	6077439	Isn't the Hi Guys joke like years old now?
6079301	6080122	You guys need a new one.
6080382	6083085	You guys get a new mascot every now and then and that's cool.
6083125	6085608	Like you went from Bob Saget to somebody else, right?
6085968	6086909	You guys need a new one.
6089051	6089271	Huh?
6089772	6090833	Yeah, DJ Konami for a while.
6094630	6102114	Those of you that are changing your nicknames in the chatroom better change them back or your FUs aren't going to get credited the right people because I haven't been following who you've been changing your names to.
6102394	6103035	I'll be right back.
6103055	6103575	In the meantime.
6103795	6105236	I figured I'd run with you for my cage match.
6105276	6106397	I'll be right back.
6106717	6107997	I've got to get a CD out of my car.
6108478	6108778	Okay.
6109618	6113461	John Fields would like to say FU to DVD burners that don't work right.
6114001	6116703	FU weather storms that knock off my favorite network.
6117623	6120165	FU to Microsoft for thinking up the ILU.
6121325	6121646	What?
6122946	6124207	Is it like a portable toilet?
6125628	6129211	I wrote a small piece on it on the thing.
6129251	6130531	I said, thank you MSN.
6131872	6134894	Now I can surf the net and take a shit at the same time.
6136215	6141439	Or as they said on Saturday Night Live last night, they're all, yes, use the ILU, log in and log out.
6143860	6144581	That's horrible.
6145061	6146242	I remember the love toilet.
6147279	6153027	Why don't they call it the iPoo?
6153147	6154369	Oh, it's the Lou in Europe.
6154549	6154910	I get it.
6156432	6157934	We're so cultured here on Orange College Radio.
6159616	6162020	SnubDisponoid would like to say a whole lot.
6162080	6162480	Here we go.
6164102	6167244	Fuck you, Symphony, for ruining a perfectly good day of sitting on my ass.
6167344	6168204	What a pain in the ass.
6168284	6168884	No, seriously.
6169225	6178349	Instead of sitting on my ass at home in a padded office chair, I have to sit on wire-framed chairs that seem to be instruments of torture and rape and play some really shitty music.
6178409	6178870	Fuck that.
6179310	6181271	Also, what the hell is with all this Korean crap?
6181311	6183272	Pump It Up, Ragnarok Online, who gives a crap?
6183292	6188414	There's a bunch of other MMORPGs out there that are much better and much less repetitive than Pump It Up Sex.
6189535	6190796	Would you like to respond to that, Jamie?
6190836	6191416	Fuck you, buddy.
6192276	6193437	I like Ragnarok Online.
6195297	6197478	I have more fun playing it and it's free.
6198678	6199038	There you go.
6199078	6199819	Free is a good thing.
6201279	6203120	And my thief is level 26.
6204320	6204921	I still like that.
6205201	6208422	And it makes me think of Secret of Mana.
6208582	6209902	So I like it and all my friends are on it.
6211243	6211583	There you go.
6212878	6215639	Pump It Up, a sort of metaphor for what the Korean language is.
6215739	6225124	Korean is basically Japanese kanji with circles and extra crap that make it seem really stupid and hard to understand, and Pump It Up is Japanese DDR with an extra arrow with a bunch of extra crap that slows it down.
6227085	6227685	Okay, here we go.
6227726	6228486	Here's another FU.
6229567	6230628	Fuck marshmallows.
6230708	6232289	They make me fucking throw up.
6232349	6233209	And fuck fries.
6233329	6236412	Loki reminded me of my painful experiences with fries.
6236772	6244297	You think that the employees being paid commission would stop them from being shit-nosed assholes sucking dirty ass cock gobblers.
6244577	6249341	Okay, you know, fries really does suck, but they actually did something good for me the other day.
6249941	6252843	And this is like... Well, no, they didn't even have any.
6253223	6254204	They were sold out.
6254785	6254945	No.
6255545	6256566	They actually did a good...
6257452	6263457	They actually did a good job and actually, you know, sold me the right thing for my computer for once.
6264138	6266900	It was a miracle when I needed a PlayStation adapter.
6266980	6270983	They knew exactly where that was, but they couldn't tell me where the fuck the hard drives were right in front of their face.
6271944	6272745	So, fuck them.
6273505	6274926	And then at the end of that rant, he said, Oh, free.
6281855	6285277	Alright, moving on, let's go to some more FUs of the week, shall we?
6285377	6293083	Let's talk to the 23rd Magus who would like to say, FU to Kentucky, again, yeah, I mean it this time, Bernier, because I say so Chicken!
6293243	6293763	Chicken!
6294564	6307993	FU to people who think they know me You don't know me, you don't know my life, you don't know And who think they know what I'm thinking, you're not psychic, bitches, go see Miss Cleo And finally, FU to not being able to go to Scandia for lack of money, my skills are slipping, dammit
6308740	6310821	Here's the part where you go, what skills?
6311222	6312963	I'm kidding.
6313924	6314504	I'm so mean.
6314544	6316866	You mean his totally elite freestyling skills?
6317066	6318587	Must keep passing eights.
6318707	6319047	Rawr.
6319147	6319748	Okay, out.
6320708	6321068	Okay.
6321929	6322449	Rock on.
6324352	6324792	Who's next?
6325413	6325473	Hi!
6325493	6325874	Oh, that reminds me.
6325894	6326695	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
6326715	6326935	Grr, grr, grr.
6326955	6327035	Okay.
6340695	6343576	F you to that little kid who was sitting behind us next to you.
6343596	6344856	Actually, it was like this whole little family.
6345076	6346216	And they didn't even speak English.
6346276	6347477	They spoke Russian or something.
6347797	6349137	And, like, there were three kids.
6349417	6351378	And they would, like, shake the seat and stuff.
6351438	6354598	And I would just, like, turn around and stare and be all, What the hell do you think you're doing?
6354638	6355378	You know, type thing.
6355839	6356659	They're stupid.
6356999	6359899	They were really stupid because they had no idea, like, why I was mad.
6361240	6362360	I hate kids.
6362760	6366321	There should be a law against bringing certain age children into a movie theater.
6368038	6368398	You know what?
6368438	6372882	And as far as like, well, I don't realize there's somewhat laws in R and X, but that should be like punishable by death.
6373022	6378246	I don't remember what theater I was at, but there was this kid there who was doing that to me, and her parent was right next to them.
6378746	6388634	And I turned around, and I told their, it was like the mom or something, that if she didn't control her child, I'd report her to child services, to child protection services.
6389374	6390115	And she was like, what?
6390435	6394979	I was like, yeah, because it's going to be for neglect, because I'm going to take your child and ship them off to some third world country in slavery.
6396994	6399095	And she just looked at me and her child never did it again.
6401076	6403438	I just, God, I hate kids.
6404118	6404818	You know what I should do?
6404838	6407220	I should open up a movie theater where children are banned.
6407460	6409141	I'd be the richest fucking man on the planet.
6410742	6413984	Our Dave and Buster's creation will also have a movie theater.
6414144	6414364	Yes.
6416539	6419802	Yes, I swear to God, Loki, we need to get alone and make this.
6419842	6424146	We need to make our Dave & Buster slash movie theater slash children-free world.
6424506	6425407	It would be beautiful.
6425787	6427669	I would cry cheers of joy.
6429390	6430271	Poor new land.
6431912	6432353	Oh, yeah.
6433013	6434214	You know what else you need in there?
6434234	6436616	You need the Discovery Zone in there with no children.
6437437	6438818	All those nets and balls and things.
6440379	6443082	I used to take my brothers there just so that I could go play.
6444184	6445485	Alright, one more FU from the chatroom.
6445605	6446526	I used to take naps in there.
6449328	6453871	RiceLYC3 would like to say, fuck you to my computer for buffering too much.
6454752	6458354	Means you gotta get broadband, or if you are on broadband, you need to get better broadband, I guess.
6458534	6459155	More memory!
6460616	6463218	That's it, that there completes the FUs of the week.
6463538	6464338	Yay.
6467281	6467801	I'm sorry, Loki?
6469557	6473119	I'm still going on air after I see The Matrix on Thursday.
6473159	6474940	Just go say how cool it is.
6475240	6475941	I won't give it away.
6476241	6478222	What are you going to talk about?
6478282	6479963	You're just going to sit there and go, it was so cool, man.
6480163	6483605	Oh my god, that one part, I can't tell you about it, but that one part where they did that thing.
6483825	6484946	Oh my god, oh, it's cool.
6487888	6489949	Yeah, pretty much like that.
6493291	6496973	Okay, so I guess now's a good time to take a break, but I'm actually thinking let's just do Cage Match now.
6497990	6498551	Sure!
6498811	6502254	Okay, so, let us do the cage match.
6503515	6504276	That will be fun.
6505737	6507719	That will be more fun than a barrel of monkeys.
6510282	6511503	Did you find your cage match song, Loki?
6512424	6512624	Good.
6514165	6516468	Alright, let's go into the Orange Lounge cage match.
6518349	6520752	Last week, on the Orange Lounge cage match...
6522438	6525440	A real shocker, I don't know how this song won, but it did.
6525540	6527601	It won by a very narrow margin, I must say.
6529062	6531944	And, um... Oh god, did I just fuck up my computer?
6535506	6536326	Hold on a minute, kids.
6536466	6544971	I accidentally copied one folder somewhere else, and now... I don't know if I can undo.
6544991	6546872	Son of a bitch.
6547033	6549174	If you're running Windows, hit Ctrl-Z and it'll undo it.
6551926	6552887	Hold on a minute, kids.
6554628	6556249	Okay, we gotta take a really fast break.
6556309	6556929	Sorry, you guys.
6557449	6558530	Because I fucked something up.
6558570	6561972	I moved my MIRC directory somewhere else, and now I can't access half my files.
6562012	6562732	I gotta move it back.
6563973	6565034	We'll take a really quick break.
6565054	6566534	We'll be right back, and we'll do the cage match.
6566575	6567015	Sorry!
6582525	6583125	and many more.
6629250	6629951	The Stars Hi
6691247	6692036	and now the win.
6752631	6756672	All right, that was, and then our mics were off during that whole little past thing, my bad.
6758273	6758873	Yeah, oops.
6758893	6762334	You know, they're like, why is the cage match music playing and no one's talking?
6762394	6762654	Oops.
6762894	6766775	She's on that I Love the 80s show every once in a while on VH1.
6767035	6769656	Again, that was last week's winner that you just heard a little clip of that.
6769676	6770356	That was Raven Simone.
6770396	6772397	We were doing crisscross effort in the background.
6772417	6774997	Who was the youngest girl on the Cosby show with That's What Little Girls Are Made Of.
6775018	6777218	And that's the first song you can vote for in tonight's cage match.
6777238	6779639	So that was Raven Simone, That's What Little Girls Are Made Of.
6780299	6781680	Alright, that was last week's winner.
6781700	6783400	I wasn't here to rate it, so it gets a three.
6783920	6784161	Okay.
6784941	6786241	Oh, you weren't here to rate it, that's right.
6786461	6788222	No, I was having a personal crisis.
6788262	6790543	That's right, you left mid-show for reasons.
6790763	6791463	Personal crisis!
6791764	6792364	Personal crisis.
6792584	6793304	An incredible crisis.
6796005	6800347	So, you can vote for that, and I think you should, because it would be wonderful if that song won again.
6801107	6804929	And let's see how many private messages I got saying to turn on the damn mics.
6806169	6807730	Oh, actually, I didn't get any.
6808310	6809451	But I do have a question.
6809491	6810751	This has nothing to do with the cage match.
6811332	6814413	Jamie, when are you going to have time to do more work on the Battle Royale roleplay?
6815794	6817475	Um, who's that from?
6818715	6819176	Uh, Puppy.
6819616	6819916	Puppy?
6820837	6824458	Um, Puppy, we'll work on it Tuesday night if I'm not out.
6825079	6825299	Okay.
6825419	6827340	But I'm not going to be up late because I'm working now.
6827740	6827980	Okay.
6828881	6830001	Okay, into the cage match.
6830261	6830982	Back to the cage match.
6831042	6833423	Loki, what track on the CD do we want here?
6836799	6846524	Oh, son of a bitch, it's not showing me the... It's a, it's a, um, um... Oh, God, I gotta use Windows Media Player to do this.
6846844	6848165	Hold on a sec, we might have a drop.
6848745	6849445	Where's CD Player?
6851586	6855809	Accessories, Entertainment... I don't have a CD Player.
6856129	6859130	I don't think XP has one, because you brought in the Media Player.
6859170	6860411	Hold on, we might have a couple drops here.
6862592	6863773	Loki, what's your pick this week?
6863933	6864473	Tell us about it.
6869065	6875450	Okay, my pick this week is from the upcoming movie, which is in four days, Matrix Reloaded.
6876010	6878752	As part of the score, it's actually really awesome.
6878793	6882896	It's the scene that they're going to be having that kick-ass awesome car chase scene.
6883596	6887179	This is also named after a book that came out a while back.
6887879	6889681	It's called Mona Lisa Overdrive.
6889801	6892063	It's Juno Reactor and Don Davis.
6893371	6895353	Now, are we really playing the whole ten minutes of this?
6896134	6898075	We can play like five to eight minutes.
6898596	6904301	Okay, we're going to play a portion of this song, because Loki actually does have an edit of this, but we can't play that right now.
6904802	6909906	Yeah, the edit of it is on my computer, but my sound card sucks ass, and so, yeah.
6910087	6915652	But because there's an edit of it, that's because I'm doing it for Tourney Mix 4, so look for that.
6916983	6917564	Alright, so here it is.
6917604	6919647	This is part of Mona Lisa Overdrive.
6919667	6923452	But be advised that if you vote for this song, it'll probably be cut down a little bit.
6923472	6924854	Well, we're only going to play a little bit cut.
6924954	6926777	We're just going to kind of play like a few minutes of it.
6926817	6930301	Because it's a ten minute long song, so we're not going to have the whole thing in rotation.
6930321	6931783	We'll have an edit if it wins.
6931904	6932164	Okay?
6932404	6932865	So here it is.
6933025	6933306	Enjoy.
6994051	6995712	Music Music Music Music
7024123	7025691	Thanks for watching!
7054030	7055873	DarkSakura
7322177	7322277	3, 2, 1, GO!
7360290	7363492	All right, that was Loki's pick, Mona Lisa Overdrive, a little edit of that.
7364913	7368215	If it does win, there's going to be an edit put in rotation that's even shorter.
7368235	7372719	It just pretty much has the techno parts of it.
7372939	7373439	But it's cool.
7373539	7374260	The edit's really cool.
7374280	7375761	Hopefully we can play the edit for you at the end of the show.
7375781	7377742	We're just having some problems on Loki's computer right now.
7378322	7381865	Anyway, let's go around the room and see what people thought, starting with Jenny, because she has the mic.
7383974	7387056	It definitely sounded like something that's supposed to go behind something.
7387657	7396984	It wouldn't be something that I would want to listen to over and over and over again, so... But it didn't suck, it's just not something that I would, you know, listen to a lot of, so I'd give it an 8.
7397084	7397424	Okay.
7399245	7399646	Brad.
7400626	7401687	Yeah, Brad and Irene are here.
7402168	7403909	Oh, hi Brad and Irene, who got here, by the way.
7404329	7404750	Wrangles.
7407099	7408320	I think it was a good song.
7409100	7411121	I kind of agree, it's a soundtrack song.
7411421	7414523	I can't wait to see the movie, I'm sure it's going to kick ass there.
7414563	7415863	But it's a good song, I'd give it a 9.
7417424	7418865	Irene, the rights princess.
7420565	7423507	I have a short attention span, and it was a long song.
7423947	7427669	It doesn't mean it was bad, it's just hard for me to concentrate on it.
7428129	7429890	Yeah, I know, it's like a freaking long song.
7430250	7436093	But it was a good song, like I mean, for a soundtrack song, I mean it was good, so I'd give it an 8.
7437313	7437633	Okay, 0.
7440594	7445276	Going by the fact that it's even on the movie, I would give it a 10, but I can't do that because I wouldn't be nice.
7445976	7449978	No, actually, it definitely seems like something, yeah, that would be on a movie.
7449998	7458381	It's not something that you'd hear anywhere else except the soundtrack or the movie, but I liked it a lot, and I actually downloaded it, and I think I enjoyed it.
7458421	7458901	I give it like a 9.
7458941	7459141	Okay.
7461102	7463324	It's fucking awesome, dude.
7463344	7468567	I've listened to that song, I kid you not, 60 times at least since I've gotten this soundtrack.
7468948	7470148	And that was only a couple days ago.
7470449	7472290	And it's awesome driving music.
7472370	7473331	Perfect for driving.
7473351	7475472	You just get going and it's like, yeah!
7475952	7476993	Your own track, real fast.
7477333	7478474	No, but it's really awesome.
7478494	7483918	I wish you guys could listen to the whole thing because it does pick up even more afterwards and gets really cool techno-y stuff.
7484298	7489642	But like I said before, it is going to be my pick for Tourney Mix 4 and you're going to hear a pretty good cut of it then.
7506425	7508047	But, I have an unfair advantage.
7508087	7515394	I've heard that edit that Loki's done, the two and a half minute edit, and he really has taken all the best parts of the song and made it a standalone song.
7515414	7519879	Like, he took all the... It kind of sounds a little tackish, actually, to me.
7520319	7523442	I did kind of think of that, but... Back to the soundtrack thing.
7523763	7524023	Right.
7524604	7528468	Actually, there's another song in there called just Chateau that does sound like Gravity.
7528488	7529108	Ooh!
7530469	7532370	Wouldn't it be cool if they detected the soundtrack?
7532650	7535311	That'll be, let's do it, that is a topic of discussion when we come back.
7535351	7537052	The money artists we want to see do movie scores.
7537072	7541693	But anyway, um, I think that, um, I think it's a good song.
7541713	7545775	I think the edit's really, really good, and that if that goes into rotation, it'll be fine.
7545835	7546695	So I give it a nine.
7547216	7548196	It's a good song, it really is.
7548596	7556199	Um, but yeah, we just, if I heard all that kind of symphonic stuff during the dance, our normal Domani music, I'd probably go to sleep.
7557532	7562574	Well, I think it should be mentioned that I was going to do a remix with that being part of the remix.
7562714	7568716	That was supposed to be entered into the remixing contest, which is the deadline is tomorrow, but I don't think that's going to happen.
7569177	7570797	But I was planning on doing a remix of it.
7573778	7575039	Alright, let's get into Jamie's pick.
7575059	7576179	Jamie, what did you bring to the table today?
7576199	7576420	Mine's old.
7577300	7582342	I couldn't think of anything else again, so I just picked Herbie Hancock Rocket.
7583041	7584082	And this is from a game, isn't it?
7584383	7586906	Well, they did it in different versions of Amplitude.
7587206	7590050	Okay, but this is a cool song, so here's your last pick for tonight.
7590330	7592212	This is Herbie Hancock with Rocket.
7926125	7928986	All righty, that was Herbie Hancock with Rocket.
7929826	7930886	Hope you all enjoyed that one.
7932067	7935407	Let's go around and see what everyone else thought of Herbie Hancock, Rocket.
7935788	7937448	Starting off with Jamie.
7938088	7938428	Ten.
7939529	7940629	You want to give any reasons why?
7942109	7942429	Ten.
7943129	7943450	All right.
7945070	7945810	I'll take that as a no.
7946670	7947971	Irene, any of you, what do you think?
7947991	7948331	I liked it a lot.
7948611	7949551	I liked it a lot, nine.
7950311	7950571	All right.
7951992	7952352	Loki.
7954261	7956604	Zero, what did you think of Herbie Hancock Rocket?
7962096	7963337	What don't I think of that song?
7963937	7978064	No, actually, that is the second song of the 80s I remember, besides that super happy stalker song by The Police, but I give that song a 10, just because it's been a favorite of mine forever.
7979165	7980346	Brad, do you have anything you want to say?
7981486	7980346	10.
7981886	7982467	Brad gives it a 10.
7982507	7984188	Brad throws a 10 out through the door.
7986322	7987784	I like that song, it's pretty cool.
7988064	7997198	If they ever did like a 2DX classic version or something, and like brought back a bunch of old 80s songs, I would cry my eyes out if that was not in it.
7997358	7998880	I'm working on a file for the 2DX...
8001486	8004287	And now, the winning song of the week
8033231	8037833	You can vote for The Matrix Reloaded with Mona Lisa Overdrive, which I can't play a clip of now.
8039193	8041194	Play a small little clip and I'll hold the mic up.
8041214	8043235	It's hooked up now.
8043255	8043815	Oh, is it hooked up now?
8043895	8044575	Then play a little clip.
8051618	8053199	Alright, that's Mona Lisa Overdrive.
8053579	8055980	Or you can vote for Herbie Hancock with Rocket.
8065916	8067356	That was kind of a bad part of the song I picked.
8067396	8067697	My bad.
8067717	8069117	But you just heard it, so you remember it.
8069437	8070117	All right, there you go.
8070157	8072998	You can vote for Raven-Symoné, Mona Lisa, Overdrive, Herbie Hancock.
8073518	8077160	Send those votes now over private message to Sky in the chat room.
8077680	8080601	And if you're not in our chat room, get your fucking butt in there right now.
8080681	8082521	Go over to Calibamani.com.
8082801	8083461	Click on Orange Lounge.
8083481	8083802	Click on Chat.
8083862	8086262	I'm glad I picked that song because it makes you say cock a lot.
8089083	8090704	Herbie Hancock.
8091144	8091544	Cock rock.
8091792	8093953	Now they're getting in quite a fight in the chat room right now.
8094253	8094933	This is what I'm reading.
8094973	8097935	I'm reading Raven, Mona, Raven, Mona, Raven, Mona.
8101176	8102076	Raven, Mona, cock.
8102096	8102557	Raven, Mona, cock.
8102577	8103597	Tonight's cage match.
8105018	8106278	It's a raving, moaning cock.
8106298	8107679	No, it's a cock rocket.
8112805	8117906	Only on Orange Lounge Radio do you get the waving, moaning cock rocket here on the cage match.
8121567	8124408	So, you want to know what's funny about Asian porn?
8124588	8124768	What?
8124948	8126488	It looks like Legos having sex.
8127528	8128168	Why do you say that?
8128188	8130429	You have to explain that for those who may not have seen Asian porn.
8130449	8135070	Because it's all blocked out and stuff because they're Japanese laws.
8135210	8137410	No private parts can be shown.
8137831	8139811	So it just looks like a bunch of Legos having sex.
8147313	8149015	It's Aztec sex, baby.
8149475	8149916	Oh yeah.
8150296	8150957	Go Mosaic.
8157355	8157975	Thanks for watching!
8182780	8183841	Great Dead Airspace here.
8184701	8189302	Sorry, I'm starting to tally up some of the votes here.
8189422	8192203	No, you guys missed the philosophical message of the day.
8194523	8198425	Life is a sexually transmitted fatal disease that's also hereditary.
8199205	8202746	After your mom gave blowjobs at a truck stop.
8203586	8206287	I said after your mom gave blowjobs at a truck stop.
8207467	8210548	He downloaded the mall blowjobs.
8213658	8216180	It was, it was like, uh, street blowjobs.
8216200	8223186	It's this guy with this camera and his glasses and he convinces some girl to give him a blowjob, supposedly.
8225908	8228770	I, well, shh, you, you lie.
8229591	8230592	You're, you're saying it's all set.
8230772	8233094	Next thing you're probably saying is, wrestling's fake.
8233114	8235576	No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.
8238396	8239757	The Amazing Flying Microphone.
8239877	8240457	Bad catch.
8241298	8242458	No, wrestling is not fake.
8242538	8243039	It's real.
8243299	8243799	Real fake.
8246360	8247041	You funny.
8249082	8249202	Boo!
8249382	8252163	Looks like Drew is going to go off the turnbuckle with the elbow there.
8253584	8254865	She's slapping her elbow.
8256926	8260068	Alright, last call for votes in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.
8260088	8261769	In the meantime, let's take a quick break.
8262149	8262689	Vote, bitches.
8263149	8264550	And what do we want to do when we come back from the break?
8264810	8265110	Polka.
8265731	8266031	Polka?
8269022	8273103	Oh, yeah, yeah, we're going to do that topic about Mamani artists and soundtracks and movies they should have done.
8273524	8276325	Nah, it's too weird to be a list list, but we could do a list list.
8277425	8279126	But then again, I'm too lazy to get papers, so we'll just talk.
8283407	8284147	Alright, fine.
8285768	8287308	Okay, last call for Cage Match, folks.
8289574	8290095	I'll play it later.
8291075	8291396	Alright.
8292857	8298401	We'll be back after this quick break featuring... Oh, I don't know.
8299322	8300843	What kind of song should I play here?
8301163	8303125	Oh, let's do something.
8303165	8304566	I should do something from EX3.
8305607	8308129	Dance Mania EX3 was out a couple weeks ago and I got a copy of it.
8308509	8308929	Thank you.
8310971	8311912	And we'll play...
8314386	8315587	The songs on it are kind of weird.
8316007	8319610	Do you want Smile DK or do you want the band that did I Do What Do I Do?
8320071	8320711	Help I'm a Fish.
8321492	8322173	Help I'm a Fish.
8324494	8325495	Let's do Help I'm a Fish.
8325535	8326336	That's the song I like more.
8327017	8328878	This is Creamy with Help I'm a Fish.
8328978	8332181	It's a brand new Dance Mania EX3 song and we'll be back in a little bit.
8455229	8456291	Thanks for watching!
8588536	8589256	Alright, that was 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 7.
8590677	8592539	Before that, help, I'm a fish by Creamy.
8592579	8596643	And really fast, we're still in the middle of a break here, but Irene, would you share your bean burrito theory?
8601563	8619538	I came up with the bean burrito theory a couple years ago when I heard that song, the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, because artists, some artists on DDR, they just pull random themes or just random words and put them together in a song, and it just sounds stupid.
8619819	8624402	Like, you know, and the reason I came up with bean burrito is just like, oh, you know, hey, I'm hungry.
8624703	8628346	Oh, bean burrito, la, la, la, la, it's just like, it's stupid, yeah.
8628366	8628626	It's stupid.
8629246	8635508	Bean burrito, guacamole, sour cream, and extra cheese.
8636568	8638088	I haven't thought up any other lyrics yet.
8638128	8638828	Let's put that in GDR.
8638888	8638968	Yay!
8641029	8641969	It's the Mexican version.
8642169	8643029	Can you sing that one more time?
8644410	8650411	Bean burrito, guacamole, sour cream, and extra cheese.
8651111	8654012	I'm gonna punch you, Rob, you're a dork.
8655461	8658542	I just wanted an extra clean copy of that for any remixes we might plan.
8658602	8658982	Thank you.
8659202	8659962	Oh, you're welcome.
8660222	8662642	Okay, well, let's look at Crash here.
8663222	8664383	I'm gonna go my way.
8664483	8665743	Come with me, you mothers.
8666303	8666843	Let's go.
8668583	8670644	One, two, three, four, five.
8670704	8672064	Break the doll and get out of here.
8672164	8672904	Come with me now.
8673024	8674264	Now we're all going our way.
8674765	8675445	Makes no sense.
8675545	8681706	I want to show you, baby, the world that you've never seen because it can happen now.
8681826	8682866	So hold you tight, babe.
8683393	8686114	Just pick any Eurobeat song.
8686655	8688215	Any Eurobeat song.
8691157	8692798	I don't want to know what they say.
8692958	8694138	No, no, I don't care.
8694278	8695619	They can tell me nothing.
8695919	8696800	I'm going to go my way.
8696840	8698941	You're not doing it right.
8698961	8700301	I don't want to know.
8700441	8701402	It's like Mr. Spanky singing.
8701862	8707485	Well, you know, I don't want my voice being made into some sort of DWI, so obviously I'm not going to do it with any rhythm.
8708265	8709646	We really don't need to hear it all now.
8712076	8713217	Hey, we're still in break time.
8713257	8714538	Go on and fall apart.
8714658	8715118	Let's go.
8715498	8715638	Ah.
8716699	8716819	Ah.
8717219	8717319	Ah.
8717440	8717720	All right.
8717780	8718260	Back to break.
8719201	8720061	I'm going to play this.
8720081	8722503	This is something that Justin's working on.
8722543	8723504	It's a world premiere.
8723604	8724644	It's an original piece.
8725565	8727546	And he's even calling himself different names now, too.
8727586	8728187	This is pretty funny.
8728227	8729628	He's calling himself Hyper Orchestra.
8730108	8734150	So this is Hyper Orchestra with Musette in D. This is a little sample.
8734411	8735431	It's a work in progress.
8735832	8738974	And then after that, we're going to hear a request that Jamie wants you all to hear.
8739434	8740835	So we shall do that.
8740855	8740975	Okay.
8814731	8816432	Thank you for watching!
8867167	8868544	Just to be with you tonight
8886314	8894859	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.
8894899	8900922	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
8901302	8906445	Hi, we're back, and Jamie, what did you think of that Hyper Orchestra Musette in D piece?
8906886	8908146	Cool, but it needs a little bit more work.
8908406	8908947	Yeah, it needs to be longer.
8908967	8909567	It needs more going on.
8909707	8910107	More going on.
8910267	8910908	And a different rhythm.
8911328	8912329	A different drum beat.
8913309	8914550	But does it make you want to kill people?
8915583	8916183	Eventually it will.
8917684	8918545	It makes me want to kill people.
8919005	8919925	I think it's at that level for me.
8922007	8922447	Yeah, you're right.
8922487	8923928	I do want to kill people, Irene.
8924008	8925569	Sorry, Zero.
8925609	8925789	Huh?
8926049	8927330	I thought you said... I just said death.
8927610	8928270	But anyways, death.
8930732	8931612	Burritos.
8932933	8933333	Chicken.
8934193	8938856	Okay, so while they play... Nachos.
8938976	8943919	...vinyl over there, the winner of tonight's cage match, by the way, can we get a big drumroll?
8946649	8950132	Okay, the winner is Mona Lisa Overdrive won the cage match.
8950332	8950892	Yay.
8950912	8951393	Of course.
8951613	8953575	So now you can use that next week, Jamie.
8955276	8961541	But this is the first week I can remember in a long, long time where every song did get at least one vote.
8962022	8965545	Usually my picks don't even get a vote, but tonight every song at least got one vote.
8966526	8967667	It's Raven-Symoné.
8967907	8968908	Everyone's a winner.
8969188	8970109	At least two votes no.
8972409	8973871	Everybody loves a seven-year-old.
8973891	8976073	Raven-Symoné was not lucky enough to get two votes tonight.
8978675	8980077	Stop putting on Raven-Symoné.
8980117	8980717	She sucks.
8980777	8981858	Sucks!
8982119	8983480	I didn't vote her as the winner last week.
8985462	8987244	You guys voted her as the winner?
8987804	8988545	I'm dismayed.
8989686	8990827	Our listeners suck.
8991628	8992389	Why are you dismayed?
8992989	8994231	Because Rocket owns you.
8995367	8996088	Rocket owns.
8996268	9000912	Rocket does own and it did get a good reaction but unfortunately you just got beat by the Matrix like everything else.
9001992	9002913	Poopy on the Matrix.
9003113	9004334	I don't believe in the Matrix.
9005795	9008097	Watch me bend this spoon with the power of my mind.
9010779	9011800	I'll hack the world!
9021363	9023585	Yes, sir.
9025346	9027067	Anyway, more topics.
9027127	9032171	Like promised earlier, we wanted to talk about movies that Bomani artists should do soundtracks to.
9032531	9037535	Now, this could be like upcoming sequels or just like ideas for films or movies in the past that would have been cooler.
9037855	9038776	X-Men movie, Tack.
9039456	9040777	X-Men movie with a Tack soundtrack?
9040957	9041838	Matrix with Tack.
9042298	9043099	Matrix with Tack?
9043539	9045020	Babes in Toyland featuring Tack.
9045361	9047602	Is there any movie you wouldn't want to see Tack doing the soundtrack to?
9050404	9051125	Seki movies.
9053246	9054607	Yes, Loki.
9057108	9058849	Glitter 2 featuring Paul Terry.
9063331	9064272	That was cute.
9064312	9065533	He did a little happy hop.
9066673	9067794	He did a little happy hopper.
9068454	9075158	How about Orange Lounge, the band, doing a soundtrack to a porno?
9078369	9079029	French porno.
9083730	9084270	Stop it.
9085371	9086291	Joker over there.
9086851	9088171	That would be funny and you know it.
9090332	9093552	Yeah, I could see Taka doing like a really epic kind of film.
9094113	9094553	Taka?
9094853	9095593	Doing like an epic film.
9095613	9097213	I was thinking more like a Samba Kubota.
9098213	9099634	That would be cool.
9099794	9101394	Like Zero says a gothic porno.
9102454	9104355	Kubota doing RPG music.
9104375	9105155	What?
9107754	9121825	I don't know if anybody in the listening knows this for a fact, but, you know, since it is Konami, Metal Gear Solid, I don't know, maybe, but Red Nikita does remind me of Metal Gear Solid, kind of, so, maybe that he actually had some actual production in the music of Metal Gear Solid of some way.
9123667	9133715	One thing, um, for my Metal Gear Solid CD that I have, there's the, um, theme song remix by Quadra on the end, and, you know, Quadra did 5-key stuff.
9133755	9133995	Mm-hmm.
9136323	9141625	Okay, for probably one of the most horrible sequels ever, if they want to make it redeeming, they should have good music.
9142005	9152989	It'd be cool to see, like, um, Tack and Taka doing, um, some good music for the horrible-ass Street Fighter, uh, sequel that's gonna be coming out.
9153549	9154830	I mean, it's pretty bad.
9154870	9155710	You didn't hear about that?
9156738	9157238	The Movie.
9157718	9160279	You remember the crappy ass Van Damme?
9160680	9161660	They're doing a sequel!
9161980	9162860	And yes, he is back in it.
9162880	9163341	That is awesome.
9164181	9165982	So they might as well... I would go see that.
9166022	9169403	They might as well dig, of course, the Bane bad guy is supposed to be a Kona.
9169523	9170703	Is Kylie Minogue gonna be back in it?
9170924	9171304	I would.
9171324	9172044	That would be the best.
9172164	9172884	She better be.
9173024	9173925	That would be the only reason.
9174225	9175265	I know, she has a career now.
9175365	9176026	I'm the green fairy!
9177786	9177966	No.
9180087	9180907	Break in three.
9182688	9183688	Featuring good cool.
9183749	9184689	That would be awesome.
9187136	9188718	What's this in the VCR right now?
9189178	9194284	We're watching, we've been... Okay, the only breakin' movie I'd ever seen was the sequel, Breakin' 2, Electric Boogaloo.
9195104	9195685	Is it breakdancing?
9196025	9197127	Breakdancing, it's like done in 82, 83.
9197187	9197587	Nice.
9197607	9198488	I like that.
9201051	9201631	I like that.
9201691	9202612	Here's a cute joke.
9203694	9204334	Here's a cute joke.
9204374	9208459	Terminator 2DX, this is from the chatroom, Terminator 2DX with Tran as Terminator.
9209865	9216011	Yes, but if you've ever heard... Have you ever seen the Terminator movie, guys?
9216111	9216831	I mean, the music is like...
9221966	9223387	It's just a bunch of weird sound effects.
9223427	9228070	It's like the guy pressed on his keyboard a couple times and said, Here, this is a soundtrack.
9228130	9233394	Have you ever seen the Mr. Science Theater 3000 version of Pod People?
9233714	9236176	Where they're doing their New Age music?
9236776	9240999	Now put your finger on this key.
9241339	9242640	Now you're playing New Age key.
9243281	9244461	Now put two fingers on there.
9244682	9245682	Now you're playing New Age chord.
9245722	9246363	Now hold it down.
9247043	9261782	until you get a record label and hold it down it was hilarious back to the soundtracks idea I'm thinking of a scary movie let's say The Ring 2 because you know they're going to do a sequel to The Ring based on one of the Japanese movies
9262662	9263342	Like Ringu too.
9264063	9266384	How about Akira Yamaoka doing the soundtrack?
9266984	9269085	Dude, he did the soundtracks for Silent Hill.
9269125	9271786	Some of the creepiest games ever.
9272146	9273227	I went on a road trip once.
9273347	9277949	My friend Garrett drove me out to these roads that are not lit very well.
9277969	9279009	So it's like a scary place.
9279509	9283571	There's all these trees and railroad tracks that look all abandoned and stuff.
9284111	9286173	And we played Silent Hill while driving through there.
9286193	9286633	It was scary.
9286673	9287093	The music?
9287113	9287654	The soundtrack?
9287814	9288014	Yes.
9288214	9288714	Oh my god.
9288754	9289815	Because it's really messed up.
9289835	9292157	I'd never really heard Silent Hill music before because I'd never played the game.
9292177	9294338	It kind of sounds like Portishead.
9294358	9295779	I was really surprised.
9296099	9298881	It doesn't sound like anything Kiriyama has done in 2DX.
9299342	9299502	Nope.
9299762	9300122	Not really.
9300542	9304125	The theme of Silent Hill sounds like Sour Time.
9304405	9305886	Yeah, the Portishead song.
9305926	9308788	It's got that guitar or ukulele or whatever they're doing.
9309248	9311350	The me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me.
9313436	9313876	Mandolin?
9314877	9315457	A mandolin?
9322703	9325585	Hey, we love dead air here at Orange Lounge.
9325605	9327126	Sorry, I've been reading private messages.
9327146	9328086	He was killing a bug with Asian porn.
9328106	9330588	There's a really funny one I'll have to share with you guys off air.
9332469	9334071	Insect Zero, Asian Porn One.
9339014	9341716	The shape and boob chick killed the bug.
9341936	9342977	Any other soundtrack ideas?
9345492	9350995	Yeah, we can have True Kiss Destination doing... The Hulk 2.
9356478	9357258	Yeah, I got it this time.
9357278	9357898	I caught the mic.
9358519	9359039	Irene has one.
9360179	9361560	Duval doing Disney?
9363761	9364942	Like, what Disney movie?
9366564	9367244	I don't know.
9372166	9376207	As the chat room suggested during Help, I'm a Fish, that should be in Finding Nemo, the new movie coming out.
9376807	9377367	You know what?
9377827	9378047	No.
9379768	9382269	Enemy Zero featuring Desro.
9384449	9386930	The movie that you made me watch with the aliens.
9388752	9391094	Wild Zero, yeah, featuring Desro.
9391354	9393276	Any trauma film featuring Desro.
9393756	9396399	No, the Guitar Wolf.
9396919	9397500	Orange Lounge.
9397720	9400242	Guitar Wolf and Guitar Freaks.
9402844	9405687	Orange Lounge should do the soundtrack to the next John Waters movie.
9417068	9418489	I think I killed the station.
9418689	9419649	Well, let's see here.
9419749	9429774	We could have the next American Pie movie with Mr. Brian in the final van.
9430895	9432455	There is an American Pie movie coming out.
9432476	9433276	American Wedding, I know.
9434416	9434617	I know.
9434637	9435297	It's the last one.
9437638	9438819	Yeah.
9440019	9440780	Yeah.
9442100	9443981	I have a movie called 4-2-K that you need to watch.
9444021	9445562	It's hilarious in parts.
9448160	9449380	It's got punk music in it.
9453882	9455322	No, it's funny.
9455423	9468207	It has to do with these zombies attacking, they're like these zombies attacking this house and then they get these like renta ninjas that come over and then, and there's like, no, there's these four alien chicks that are, it's weird.
9468767	9470228	Let me find the tape, it's hilarious.
9471708	9476810	Now, Rob, weren't you the one who was telling me about them actually doing a true sequel to the Rocky Horror Picture Show?
9479312	9482774	It's a rumor that comes up every now and then.
9482794	9485175	If they did that one, have the music by Orange Lounge.
9485696	9487997	That would be cool, except you know the problem with that?
9488077	9489178	Richard O'Brien has to do it.
9489318	9492679	Yeah, so that he should contract Orange Lounge.
9493060	9494540	Okay, Orange Lounge can make a contribution.
9494560	9496982	And he writes the lyrics, but they're not all in French.
9499730	9503432	I think he gets some help from Rina Gumo to do something like Secret Tale.
9504773	9505674	That's really bad.
9505794	9506174	I'm sorry.
9506774	9509596	No, but in all honesty, I think LED should do something in a music industry.
9509636	9509896	Yes.
9510097	9512998	Like a Matrix-type movie, you know, a lot of action.
9513018	9519783	Because some of his really, you know, like The Outer Limits, that song, something like that, breakbeats.
9520723	9521705	Here's a question for you guys.
9522105	9525209	Maybe this has been brought up on the show before, but I actually don't think it ever has, which is surprising.
9525870	9532078	If a Bomani artist, any Bomani artist, were to release a CD here in the US, which one should do it and why?
9532138	9533881	Who would have the best chances of success?
9535416	9537518	Well, Jamie says tack, and Sheila says that.
9538538	9538919	She says.
9539319	9541100	I mean, I only said that because she's just said that.
9541300	9543542	And, go ahead, Matt, Loki.
9543802	9549626	Well, obviously, it's gotta be, um, I believe, isn't Last Message the good cool featuring Meg?
9549906	9551908	Well, then it'd have to be Meg, because she has a nice rack.
9552330	9555831	One thing, actually, Fantastic Plastic Machine does have a CD in the U.S.
9556751	9557151	I have it.
9557551	9567574	Outside of ones that already do have one, and maybe like the one, two, like outside of Dance Mania artists, let's say, because Dance Mania artists already have CDs, most of them, let's say like Actual Bomani.
9567654	9569814	Actual Bomani, you know, sounds sad.
9569834	9570735	Konami sounds sad.
9570755	9571495	I guess we could say.
9573635	9577856	In all honesty, from the, yeah, Jamie and Matt both say good, cool.
9578937	9579777	Ryo Nagumi.
9580698	9583142	I agree, I think Good Cool would have the most chance of success.
9583542	9587048	Actually though, it's funny you mention it, I think one person that would have a really kick-ass CD, LED.
9587709	9591655	And I say that because he has so many different styles, like something wonderful...
9595403	9599465	I have something to say.
9599606	9599806	Sure.
9600386	9610392	All the staple artists in the Konami sound staff who are making music for Bomani Games, Taka, Tak,
9611232	9613935	LED, Naoki, Good Cool.
9615476	9617578	I'm probably repeating names because they use the same names all the time.
9617658	9627166	Anyway, they all have a chance releasing and selling good music because they all have good resumes as far as music they've written, so it's really hard to choose which one.
9627486	9634813	I mean, Akira Yamaoka, he's made music and games that are very popular in America, so it's hard to say.
9634833	9635834	Soda.
9635874	9636114	Soda.
9639954	9640995	I don't know.
9642516	9644597	It'll be okay.
9644657	9645057	I don't know.
9647018	9649019	He'd have to show a little more diversity before I could say that.
9649059	9654182	Yeah, that's why I think... That stuff would be picked up by DJs like... Yeah.
9654563	9657304	Because all trance music is pretty much the same anyways.
9657904	9659685	It's just all synth with a backbeat.
9659705	9660066	That's it.
9661078	9663139	I'm surprised with the popularity of DDR.
9663179	9671283	You're not hearing such cultish songs from DDR that are mega popular like Look to the Sky on some dance radio station at night.
9671863	9674484	It's because we're in Sacramento, we don't have cool stations like that.
9674824	9676285	Ours got kicked off the air, remember?
9676345	9679106	Well, there's actually one kind of weird thing.
9679226	9683648	One night I was actually coming back from CCL, just getting done playing DDR, and
9683928	9689170	I was listening to Quad, you know, on Saturdays or whatever, they play that, like, all that trancy stuff.
9689510	9692511	I actually did hear Holic, and I actually did play it.
9693371	9699093	Yes, it was, because we sat there and debated it for like an hour and a half, and it actually was Holic, which, I don't know how it got played.
9699733	9702554	But, so, someone may have said it or something.
9702574	9705115	We were in Brookfields and heard Stump to My Beat playing out of the kitchen.
9705555	9707556	Stump to My Beat, yeah, Stump to My Beat.
9707616	9709437	I know, but that was the thing, I thought that was funny.
9709877	9711577	I think Scotty D should have some stuff.
9712178	9712478	Yeah.
9713278	9713478	Yeah.
9714918	9715878	I forgot what I was going to say.
9716058	9718159	They should contract Avex tracks again.
9719339	9722680	Like they did with Parapara.
9723381	9725861	Why do you think Konami doesn't release Bomani soundtracks in the US?
9726061	9731023	Besides the fact that DDR USA, the arcade versions, wouldn't have had a good soundtrack.
9731403	9732763	Why didn't they release one for Max USA?
9733184	9734484	Besides the limited edition one.
9734784	9739705	The only reason why, and the obvious reason why, they're not releasing these things is because there isn't obviously a market for it.
9740585	9747647	I mean, we're having to pressure them so much just to release the games, there's not a market enough for them to put in money to release the soundtracks.
9747667	9749067	Because if there was, they would do it.
9749147	9749948	I mean, what are they going to say?
9750428	9754429	Oh, there's an obvious money-making market here in America, but we're not going to release them because we hate Americans.
9754469	9756789	I mean, really, they're going to release it if there's a market.
9757069	9758730	There's no market, they're not going to release it.
9759090	9763591	But over, like, almost, I think, about 25,000 registered users on DDR Freak...
9764367	9767863	And a lot of soundtracks to real movies sell 5,000 at the most.
9770899	9784762	I don't know, because usually what happens, they'll print mass amounts of the CDs because, you know, they do... I mean, you think actual artists like, you know, Britney Spears, millions of CDs get printed and millions of them get bought because that's just pop, you know?
9784782	9791223	Here's why, because Konami's cheap and they don't want licensed music, and licensing music for a game is expensive enough, let alone soundtrack rights as well.
9791283	9792383	Yeah, you have to go through more red tape.
9792403	9794964	And the fact, I mean, making the CDs themselves only costs pennies.
9795244	9795524	I mean...
9796204	9811324	It's just the whole licensing rights, and because over here in America, we're bastards, and we charge, or actually, the RIAA is bastards, and they charge up the ass for licensing rights, and copyright laws are crazy, and it's just a bad situation, that's why.
9812751	9821293	All we're gonna hear is more, like, uh, more fucking covers of Welcome to the Jungle and shit by crazy people who don't sound anything like Axl Rose.
9821353	9825074	I'm not talking about trying to make, like, DDR music, like, mainstream.
9825114	9829194	Like, oh, next on MTV, on Total Request Live, number 10, drop the bomb, yeah!
9829855	9833535	I'm not talking about that kind of thing, but just, like, trying to just at least put the music out there.
9833555	9835716	If the music isn't out there, if you want the music, you have to go underground.
9835776	9841597	Yeah, here's what I think... What I can debate why they don't do is maybe...
9842915	9846097	They're doing these releases on these home systems.
9846177	9851841	Maybe for once, maybe release a small sound CD with the game if you pre-order or something.
9852261	9853102	They did that with Max.
9853262	9854322	Yeah, Toys R Us.
9854463	9855083	Jamie's got one.
9855303	9857204	Toys R Us did that.
9858205	9859406	What was the requirements, Jamie?
9859426	9860826	Do you remember what you had to do to get that CD?
9860846	9861847	No, I got mine from...
9863567	9864989	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you got yours donated.
9866291	9866811	Quote, unquote.
9866851	9868273	No, no, mine's real.
9868854	9871317	It was given to me as a tourney.
9871717	9876924	I got a few of them that we gave out as prizes for tourney.
9877264	9877424	Right.
9877464	9878926	I remember Toys R Us was doing something with those.
9878966	9881169	I think if you pre-ordered at Toys R Us, you got that.
9881249	9882050	I think that's how it worked.
9882907	9890515	But still, I mean, that's not like... I can walk into Dimple and see it in the soundtrack section, or... Dimple is... I'm sorry, because that's only in Sacramento.
9890535	9891136	It's a record store.
9891176	9896982	So let's say I can't walk into Virgin Megastore, and Virgin Megastore imports a lot of stuff.
9897022	9899164	They don't import anything Japanese, which baffles me.
9900446	9901547	Very limited, though.
9901587	9902248	Very, very limited.
9902308	9902408	It's...
9904905	9908788	Well, I'm talking like, I don't think you can find a Yumi Hamasaki even, right?
9909128	9910810	You can even... Really?
9911270	9912951	Could you order Dance Media albums through Virgin?
9915293	9919696	I've been to the Virgin Megastore in San Francisco and I never see anything interesting Japanese-wise.
9921398	9927002	Arden doesn't have anything as far as... You have to go to the world music section, it's like crap.
9927322	9930464	The only thing you're going to find tons of shit of is like UK stuff.
9930484	9931985	You're going to find tons of UK stuff.
9932366	9933707	Because that's really popular over here.
9934770	9939335	And there's another artist that needs to come over to America, Yumi Hamasaki.
9939935	9941537	I mean, she would kick ass over here too.
9941877	9942658	Just her music's awesome.
9942698	9943900	Oh yeah, I think definitely.
9944540	9945341	Well, but here's the thing.
9946062	9949425	And it's kind of the thing with America in general and the history of music.
9949485	9953569	It's like pop has always been popular and it's always been the main thing, you know.
9953610	9955391	And yeah, we all hate pop, but...
9956172	9956592	and so on.
9975822	9983469	Exactly, we go through these phases, and we already went through our techno trance rave music phase in the mid-90s, and it's gone now.
9983790	9984851	It's not popular.
9985291	9988755	There's a lot of people doing these things, but there's a lot of freaking people in America.
9989035	9991737	A lot more people are listening to Britney Spears.
9991918	9992378	I'm sorry.
9992919	9993920	It's always going to be that way.
9993980	9995701	It's always going to be pop.
9995881	9998764	Not always, because music rotates itself every...
10000723	10003124	I wouldn't say that long, probably about more like every four years.
10003184	10004485	Okay, then watch.
10004765	10007686	Four to ten years from now, we're going to see some Bomani CDs printed, finally.
10008406	10015349	I'm going to tell you, now this is going to be a really strange sounding theory, and I know I'm going to get boos for this, but I'll tell you why Britney Spears and all that's on their way out the door.
10016069	10016970	And this is going to sound funny.
10016990	10017570	Because they suck?
10018542	10020825	Look at the three people who are in the finals in American Idol right now.
10020845	10022507	You have two overweight people and a dork.
10033662	10034123	Exactly.
10034203	10036104	What does that show America wants right now?
10036364	10040267	They are sick and tired of seeing the same cookie-cutter image.
10040848	10041088	Yep.
10041488	10043630	And... Exactly.
10043810	10048333	So I'd say that's, you know... Maybe actually want to hear the music for once and not just the image.
10048493	10059582	Far-fetched as it sounds, I think that might be starting to send a message to record companies, and I bet you sales... Well, even sales of Christina's latest album wasn't as good as her first one, and Britney's putting a new one out in October, and it's probably not going to do as well.
10059642	10061203	I think it's October, but it probably won't do as well.
10062984	10063504	We will leave.
10063524	10065505	Wouldn't it be funny if Britney Spears pulled an Alanis?
10065525	10068006	What do you mean?
10068026	10068987	Disappeared and came back?
10069007	10070688	Stop doing happy, happy, poppy?
10071208	10073529	Yeah, for those who don't know... Alanis used to be a very happy, poppy person.
10073929	10075030	I actually have a video.
10075290	10078891	Alanis was considered... Alanis Morissette was considered the Tiffany of Canada.
10079172	10080552	And she had the big, poofy hair.
10081092	10082653	Matt LeBlanc was in one of her videos.
10082673	10083714	She was on the Canadian television.
10083734	10084834	But she used to have, like, these songs.
10085114	10088156	I could probably dig up the MP3s on my computer, but I don't... I'm too lazy.
10089436	10090877	But she used to have, like, really dancey songs.
10091177	10092518	She disappeared completely...
10092998	10103443	for about four years and then came back and she'd, like, grown up and that's when she did Jagged Little Pill and it was such a controversy, you know, like, oh, now this teen princess talking about blowjobs in a theater type thing.
10103983	10106344	But, I mean, if you think about it, the real Tiffany did the same thing.
10106384	10107985	Didn't she come back and pose for Playboy?
10111706	10124633	Well, like, I mean, one thing that I've noticed, too, is all these people who have hella videos and have all these concerts and all these fucking appearances, they, you know, everybody hears their music so much that people just grow to get tired of it.
10124653	10129996	Then you got the underground people who will send their demo to a radio station or something and get it played.
10130036	10132338	More people want to see, more people want to hear...
10132998	10136861	The people who you don't see every day, as opposed to who you do see every day.
10137021	10151953	I mean, that's why I think if we did have a lot of Bimani CDs coming over, or anybody, even a lot of the underground rappers and DJs and stuff like that, most people sit there and they don't really want to really see them.
10151973	10157398	They like to know who they are, but they like the music so much, and the music is what keeps the mystery and what keeps them wanting to be there.
10157418	10159840	If you don't do a lot of appearances, people are going to want to know who you are.
10160160	10163502	They're going to want to hear your stuff more than like, oh, look, there's that hoe on TV.
10164202	10165343	You know, it's that whole thing.
10166803	10168564	Well, the DJs, they're just a name.
10168684	10171245	They're just a name so you know which CD to find.
10171366	10172066	That's it.
10172106	10175808	I mean, if you met them in real life, you're like, oh, they're really cool.
10175828	10176288	You wouldn't be like...
10176684	10179286	Oh my god, oh my god, you know, they're so cool.
10179386	10183350	No, it's just, they're just... Wait, if I saw Paul Oakenfold, I'd probably give him a hug.
10183530	10184530	Yeah, yeah.
10184551	10190055	But like, for instance, DJ David X. I mean, he's kind of popular over here.
10190495	10194379	I mean, you see him personally, you're like, damn, I don't... He's old.
10194599	10195319	Yeah, he's just some...
10196440	10199202	An actual friend of one of Dan's friends.
10199722	10200903	He's a DJ in Santa Cruz.
10200963	10203525	He's cool, and the music he plays is really cool.
10203585	10204346	That's the whole point, though.
10204646	10206007	It's not like, you know, Britney Spears.
10206747	10208909	You hear more controversy and shit about them.
10209209	10213452	When's the last time you've heard, like, a DJ and something weird happening with them?
10213832	10214053	Nothing.
10214073	10217235	Like, Oakenfold, you never hear anything on the news, like, some controversy.
10217615	10221538	Because he's just too busy making music and, you know, doing actual stuff like that.
10222789	10229996	You know what actually has made me really happy is that one of my favorite Japanese DJs has his CDs now released in the States, DJ Crush.
10231257	10232698	Makes me very, very happy.
10232918	10239324	And from what I understand, I mean, he'll do music for anyone, you know, mixing for anyone.
10240205	10242227	Just, you know, goes to clubs all the time.
10242247	10243328	I wish he'd come, actually.
10243708	10245810	Well, he had performed here because she even went to see him.
10246010	10246491	Yeah, I...
10247364	10248305	In San Francisco, I think.
10248445	10254650	But I would like for just more people internationally to make their music available.
10255771	10265118	Well, like, one thing, too, and not a lot of people are familiar with the music, but there's, like, the band called Dream Theater, and I don't know how many people know about them, but they're over in Japan a lot.
10265238	10270102	I mean, that's their basic residence is in Japan, even though they're a completely English singing group.
10270762	10275606	And their music sells a lot more over here than it does in Japan.
10277240	10305133	and they do their just random appearances like once every five years you actually get to see them and it's enough to make a person want to drop everything and go see them because they don't have huge videos over here people like their music I mean I honestly was about to cut my Santa Cruz trip because they're going to be in Sacramento on Sunday and I was about to cut it but I was like nah that's okay but still it's like the point is people will drop what you're doing if they don't see you getting in trouble and they don't see you dressing like an absolute moron and all that kind of stuff and there's still a hairband
10305854	10306875	They are still a hair band.
10306955	10307475	I love it.
10307495	10308656	They're a hair band.
10309757	10310298	Interesting point.
10310318	10311358	I'm reading in the chat room.
10311438	10313360	I'm just trying to read what folks are saying in the chat room.
10313400	10315061	Jabberwocky makes an interesting point.
10315442	10316002	Hi, by the way.
10316703	10317123	Hi.
10317723	10321066	He was responding to a comment made by Justin, but this is what he says.
10321086	10324329	He says, the record companies put out hundreds of albums each month.
10324729	10326630	The terrible music is what people are buying.
10327931	10328372	Why is that?
10330461	10331362	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10350342	10350642	Why?
10351883	10353225	Why did the record company do anything?
10353325	10353585	Money?
10353865	10355026	I don't know.
10355307	10356207	This is my theory.
10356968	10358530	The publicists behind the artists.
10359050	10362373	I think there's a lot of wheeling and dealing that goes on, especially with MTV.
10362693	10371742	And MTV is to, you know, if you want to use the word blame, credit, whatever you want to choose, MTV is really what's shaping the music industry right now, like it or not.
10373051	10375413	It's all politics.
10375433	10378976	The lobbyists pay the politicians, and that's how certain laws get passed.
10379936	10381778	Although I kind of buy into the Josie theory.
10384119	10385320	The Josie and the Pussycats.
10386941	10388462	I will elaborate for people who haven't seen it.
10390104	10396968	Well, like, one thing, too, is this is only, you know, stuff that I picked up while working at, like, Intercom Radio and stuff like that.
10397729	10401452	And a lot of it, it's not so much who is, you know...
10402407	10406592	Who's how old and who looks like what or whatever.
10407133	10411659	But part of it is the fact that they will go with whoever will dress trashy.
10412179	10415824	You know, there's plenty of girls out there I have seen... Shut up.
10417583	10418164	Don't start.
10418244	10418664	No, anyways.
10419185	10422388	No, it's like, there's... What?
10422408	10423870	I see what you're about to say, though.
10424511	10427594	They go to see who will dress like the slut, who will do it.
10427614	10437064	I mean, there's plenty of girls out there who probably look like Britney Spears and who may sound like Britney Spears, but they're the ones who won't go as far as the others went.
10438346	10445852	and then, yeah, it is MTV partially because they get tons of videos crossing their path every day.
10445972	10447113	It doesn't mean they're going to play them all.
10447213	10453157	They're going to play with the ones that all the people are fantasizing about and going home and whacking off about or something.
10453418	10454118	That's all it is.
10456480	10458942	Okay, some interesting points here.
10460583	10465848	Nince says in the chat room, people buy the terrible stuff because they don't know about the better stuff out there.
10467099	10468260	That's actually exactly true.
10468280	10469140	That's a murder.
10486182	10487883	I like her stuff.
10488063	10490044	I like some of her stuff, but it's getting old.
10490104	10492745	I feel like, okay, the pop thing is getting old for me.
10492905	10494126	I'm cycling on a four-year thing.
10494546	10496146	I don't really care about her new album anymore.
10496407	10497347	She was cute back in the day.
10497447	10499068	Oh, look, what a little slut dancing on the screen.
10499528	10500368	But I don't care anymore.
10500548	10504370	I'm a fan of her future porno with her and Christina Aguilera.
10504510	10507451	Anyway, back to the point here.
10508552	10514214	How do you... There's no real way to force people to expose themselves to new music.
10515168	10521031	Yeah, I guess people will like what they want to like, but I feel like it's kind of, sometimes it's ignorance, you know?
10521111	10523912	We only hear what we can hear on the radio, most people.
10524172	10530635	Your average music listener isn't a music lover, as in, it's their life, they love it like I do, you know?
10530675	10534157	It's like, I have to listen to music all the time, I go watch live music and stuff.
10534837	10537478	All they can hear is the radio, so they're being told what to listen to.
10537598	10538659	So, that's one thing.
10538899	10543301	Another thing, yeah, you can't tell them what to listen to, what's terrible music, one person likes something else.
10543821	10545803	There is actually terrible music.
10546003	10548465	I think Britney Spears and stuff is terrible music.
10548725	10552388	There's no talent behind it except for she has boobs.
10552608	10553409	She has an ass.
10553729	10554990	She can't sing worth shit.
10555110	10556811	I've heard so many people who can sing better.
10556911	10559133	What do you think... Hold on, hold on.
10559613	10559873	Hold on.
10559954	10560634	Question, question.
10561054	10563176	What do you think about those people?
10563276	10564397	And just, they're idiots.
10564437	10565278	It's not an acceptable answer.
10565538	10571943	What do you think about those people on, like, the fan shows that talk about Britney Spears and say, Britney Spears changed my life?
10572814	10576176	I think it's exactly... There's fans of... Go ahead.
10576216	10577517	There's fans of everyone, okay?
10577577	10579398	I'm sure Bob Saget has a huge following.
10579798	10581639	I'm sure, like, Carrot Top has a huge following.
10581700	10583200	I love Bob Saget, man.
10583220	10585842	I suck dick for coke, or what was it?
10585902	10587463	There's fans for everybody.
10587543	10592066	There's fans for anybody that appears on TV for, like, just a second.
10592366	10594067	For example, G4's Portal.
10594267	10595508	That stupid guy that had...
10595968	10597229	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10615236	10617757	You know, it's just mainstream stuff right now.
10617877	10624679	Like, for instance, I don't know really why people buy their CDs and stuff since it's played on the record all, or on the radio all the time.
10625139	10629401	Like, for instance, 98 Rock in our Sacramento area here plays the same shit every day.
10629561	10633662	I can guarantee that I'll hear, like, a few songs, you know, certain songs every day.
10634663	10637263	It's just, it's just like a same playlist that's randomized.
10637283	10641385	When I worked at 98 Rock, we, my eight hour shift, you would hear a song 12 times.
10642501	10646424	and it would be the exact same, say maybe 13, 14 songs.
10646845	10648506	It would be the same song 12 times a day.
10649026	10650227	At least in one 8 hour show.
10650327	10650868	You know what though?
10650908	10651648	I'll say this though.
10652149	10654891	I got called from 98 Rock a couple times.
10655611	10661336	I don't know how I ended up on their list or whatever, but they called and would ask me to listen to little seconds of songs.
10661616	10670423	And the only reason I did it, I usually don't participate in those phone survey things, but I actually knew, I'm like, okay, what I'm saying might actually really have an effect on what they're going to play on the station, so I should participate.
10670443	10671144	And it was funny because...
10671904	10673704	A lot of the songs I'd never heard of before.
10673925	10674705	It was actually interesting.
10674745	10683967	So they were trying to test stuff I'd never heard before, but the majority of it that I found in myself liking was kind of a lot of the mainstream stuff I'd say, just because I was familiar with it.
10684327	10688008	But at the same time, there was a lot of that stuff I did recognize as me not liking.
10688068	10696290	I took one of those where they'd have me compare to, and my response to actually a lot of what they'd play, I would be like, I don't like either, I don't like either, I don't like either.
10696950	10706254	I forgot to tell you, this is totally a different subject Garrett ordered a video of Kana videos And so he's going to get it soon and you're going to have to come over and watch them
10719827	10719867	C.D.
10719887	10719987	Japan
10735940	10738942	You wanna find, like, good music?
10739343	10743686	Why don't you just do what a lot of people do, because every different type of music has this.
10743706	10745727	Why don't you go out and buy, like, samplers?
10745747	10753572	Because samplers, a lot of the times, not all the time, it depends on which label you go through, they will play new bands that not a lot of people have heard of.
10754193	10756555	And, yeah, compilations and stuff like that.
10756775	10757655	Go find those.
10758176	10759216	Play it, listen to them.
10759397	10759817	Honestly...
10760672	10761873	Yeah, movie soundtracks also.
10762153	10770416	Because honestly, you're going to find most of the music you're going to have in your music collections if you start buying compilation samplers are going to be all the ones you got off of those.
10770976	10778299	So basically, it really sucks, but stop listening to the fucking radio for five minutes and go out and spend five bucks and buy a damn sampler.
10781963	10785688	I just have a really simple basic theory.
10787090	10795482	It's just that people are going for what's familiar and what's simple, something that's not too complex.
10796374	10798756	Yeah, exactly.
10801318	10804761	So they go for Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera because it's simple.
10805682	10808785	But then everyone goes through their cycles of music.
10808825	10809365	They change.
10809405	10812308	I mean, I'm not listening to the same stuff I listened to 10 years ago, 5 years ago, whatever.
10812328	10814510	I mean, it always evolves.
10815491	10816211	I'm going to pass the mic.
10816251	10817332	Let's try and wrap this up.
10817392	10819454	I just wanted to say really quick.
10819514	10820395	Okay, go for it, Jamie.
10820635	10823517	Well, if you look at it this year, like, what do we have today, the Backstreet Boys?
10824118	10827520	You know, when I was in middle school, we had New Kids on the Block, okay?
10828081	10831983	In the 70s, there was, you know, the Partridge Family, but there was, you know, David Cassidy.
10832744	10836167	How many, he had fangirls, you know, just like when he died.
10837007	10839569	And we have the same thing happen today over these Poppy people.
10840590	10842371	It's because they have an image that can be sold.
10844012	10846094	Here's the thing, okay, really quick.
10847566	10848126	Thanks for watching!
10869455	10871477	Oh, okay, you can still be in that job and do good music.
10871497	10878584	Well, if you think about some of the best artists, not just music, art, anything, have been freaking Looney Tunes.
10878704	10882187	Like Van Gogh, high on absinthe and cut off his ear.
10882968	10883348	You know?
10886731	10887952	I can't remember the composer now.
10889454	10889674	But...
10890595	10897357	gave himself cholera-infected water so that he would die because he was... I was going to say real fast about five minutes ago.
10897617	10907421	I was going to say, as Zero was saying about the radio and, you know, stop listening to radio or whatever, try, and this is going to be a really cheap plug, but I'm serious here, go to internet radio.
10907721	10909041	Look around on Live365.
10909081	10913743	There are thousands of stations that are worth your time to listen to.
10913763	10916724	And if you want to sample new music, internet radio is a great way to do it because you have...
10917546	10921948	You have weirdos like us sitting here that put together their own stations of stuff they like.
10922348	10923948	And how do you find out about a lot of music?
10924208	10925489	Through your friends and what they like.
10926029	10929930	So go look at some other stations out there on Line 365.
10930711	10935492	We give you permission to go away from Orange Lounge Radio for a little while to go check out some other stations.
10935532	10936013	But not very long.
10936033	10936513	You've got to come back.
10938158	10939038	Yeah, 30 minutes, go.
10940319	10944941	What I was going to say, you were talking about Van Gogh.
10945061	10950763	Oh, no, no, Jamie was saying Van Gogh, he was such a talented artist, he was high on absinthe and cut off his ear, what'd he do?
10951763	10952904	Send it to his girlfriend.
10953144	10957365	He sent it to his girlfriend, I was like, well, I wonder, I bet the letter said, can you hear me now?
10959566	10961007	I know that doesn't make sense, but it was funny.
10962552	10966653	Did you have a final thought on the other topic?
10966713	10967113	Exactly.
10967453	10968733	Here's the thought that I have.
10969654	10976615	Go online, get your nice file sharing service, and download massive amounts of MP3s from artists you don't recognize.
10977015	10986337	Don't buy the CDs, because stupid artists, they don't deserve money, because if their music sucks, then they should learn, okay, no one's buying my CD, maybe I should think of a new career.
10990217	10997439	Did you put the disclaimer at the beginning that some of these people, their views and opinions do not reflect the opinions of Orange Lounge Radio?
10997739	10999379	If they don't know that by now, they're retarded.
11000819	11001239	You know what?
11001579	11002640	He's absolutely right, though.
11003300	11005880	If you can't make music, stop making crappy music.
11005940	11009961	If you have enough people telling you, hey, buddy, you're shitty, then stop making music.
11010021	11010981	Sometimes that doesn't work.
11012001	11013641	Okay, back to the Britney Spears analogy.
11013801	11016882	What about the one that says, you changed my life through your music?
11019026	11021207	There's always going to be somebody who says that.
11021227	11022048	Guess what?
11022068	11023589	Ghost in the Shell changed my life.
11024069	11027131	Because it made me want to be a ghost in the shell.
11027351	11028732	It's stupid.
11028832	11031253	You guys know how to make Lego sex.
11031653	11033815	First of all, all those people who are saying, oh, this changed my life.
11034335	11037357	First and foremost, the only one you should change your life for is yourself.
11037477	11041059	You need to take responsibility for yourself.
11041079	11042780	That's sad that one song changes your life.
11043440	11046983	The biggest problem with people today is they don't take responsibility for themselves.
11047003	11050125	Yeah, that scares me that Britney Spears is changing all these youngins' life.
11050425	11052186	It just scares me for my future.
11052507	11055569	They're putting the responsibility for their changes on other people.
11055789	11057850	They're blaming other people for what's going on in their lives.
11057910	11060772	They need to start taking responsibility and be their own person.
11062874	11063214	Yeah.
11063274	11064175	Yeah, it changed my life.
11064255	11067217	Now I wear short skirts and I have sex with everybody.
11070463	11073267	We had intelligent conversation We had intelligent conversation and debate
11086683	11088886	I guess that's debatable, and I'm sure our chatroom debates that right now.
11089066	11090788	We talked about porn, we worked porn in.
11093031	11094572	We got the blowjob thing in at the beginning.
11097496	11099117	Alright, we worked at the truck stop.
11099418	11103522	So, now I'm going to ask everybody, thank you everybody, what a good way to end Season 2.
11104123	11106245	What a very nice way to end the Season 2 finale there.
11107286	11112150	Just a reminder, everybody, next week, no show, but we got an even better thing planned.
11112210	11116613	Saturday, live, all freaking day, from B3, the tournament of the century!
11118194	11118694	At Pier 39.
11120515	11122857	We might be there Sunday as well, don't know yet.
11123798	11124198	We'll see.
11125279	11128681	Anyway, let me go around and get some final thoughts from everybody.
11128721	11129982	Jamie, you want to start or you want to be last?
11130462	11130862	I'll be last.
11131063	11132343	Okay, Brad, final thought.
11133504	11133744	Okay.
11136619	11138441	What lesson did we learn today, kids?
11138961	11141083	Music industry is communism.
11141523	11142023	Don't follow them.
11143685	11144265	Uh, okay.
11145066	11145786	Irene, final thought?
11146807	11147908	Doesn't have to be about the topic.
11147928	11149089	We've been discussing anything you want.
11150896	11151496	I'm tired.
11151716	11152317	You're tired?
11152477	11152857	Yeah.
11152977	11153597	Oh, I'm sorry, babe.
11153618	11155098	What time did you get to bed last night?
11156139	11156919	I didn't go to bed last night.
11156939	11160801	I went to bed this morning at, like, what, 6 o'clock this morning.
11160821	11162683	We went to Denny's after we dropped you off or whatever.
11162763	11163163	Oh, did you?
11163183	11163463	Yeah.
11163983	11165044	I was so tired, you guys.
11165084	11165984	It was so crazy.
11166024	11168126	Brad had to drive me home anyway.
11168206	11168986	People don't want to hear that.
11169006	11170587	People don't want to hear about that stuff.
11170647	11171707	I was very tired.
11171748	11172928	I slept for 12 hours today.
11172948	11173609	I didn't wake up until 4.
11174889	11175770	We drove it home, too.
11176530	11176910	Oh, yeah.
11177571	11178371	Loki, final thought?
11178691	11179052	Oh, sorry.
11179172	11179512	Were you done?
11179532	11179572	No.
11180353	11180954	I'm done.
11181154	11181374	Okay.
11181634	11182135	And you're spent.
11182435	11183276	Loki's busy working.
11183316	11183917	Let me ask Zero.
11184077	11184717	Zero, final thought.
11186579	11193506	Basically, my final thought is take everything we have said about the radio and use it in your daily life.
11193827	11200974	Don't be conformist and be an individual and don't let people tell you what to do and don't let them tell you what to like.
11203268	11209469	Be yourself, or else we'll just have a bunch of robots running around and it'll just end up being the destruction of the human fucking race.
11209529	11209889	Goodbye.
11210830	11212590	I guess I will go ahead and give my final thought.
11212610	11215851	My final thought is thank you everybody for supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
11215951	11219692	Thank you everybody who listens to this show every Sunday, our fans.
11220472	11228373	Thank you, by the way, to Kesa at Field of Pulse Radio, or fieldofpulse.net, Pulse Radio, for letting me be on a show on Saturday and promote tonight's show.
11228413	11228693	Thank you.
11229194	11230914	Check that out if you're into Sims Online and all that.
11231674	11235437	Thank you everybody who supports Orange Lounge Radio and listens to our Bimani Music Amore program.
11236318	11238660	It's been almost a year now that we've been doing Orange Lounge.
11238680	11239361	It's been a blast.
11239781	11242823	And in two weeks we come back to you with Orange Lounge Radio Season 3.
11243784	11247007	We're going to have a webcam of some sorts to show things when we want to show them to you.
11247765	11249146	Phones, we're working on it.
11249226	11250306	Loki is busy.
11250366	11252987	We were hoping that the phones would be the big thing we can bring into Season 3.
11253287	11256548	We don't know if we can have it the first week, but Loki is on it.
11256769	11259210	And we all know that that means scary.
11259270	11260490	So thank you everybody for your support.
11260530	11262071	We appreciate it.
11263491	11264892	Loki, quick.
11264932	11267093	I'm going to let Jamie do her final thought and then we'll end with yours.
11268093	11268373	Jamie?
11269734	11271274	Mine is, give me a dollar.
11273095	11275496	Len Loki, dare I ask, what's your final thought?
11276132	11285280	What I don't understand in this world is how there can be so many hidden camera people with these ugly guys going out, finding people in random places and getting them to do sexual acts on them.
11285640	11289263	So I leave you with yet another streetblowjob.com video.
11289523	11290664	What are you doing in here?
11290684	11291345	Just killing time?
11292706	11293226	Yeah.
11293346	11294087	And she's in arcade.
11294107	11295388	Hey, DDR related.
11295628	11297270	I'm sure there's DDR in that arcade somewhere.
11300512	11301373	Looks like Scandia.
11306453	11307373	Pretty open-minded girl?
11309734	11310834	I kind of have a moral fetish.
11310854	11313095	What do you think about it?
11313135	11314195	You think about it?
11314575	11315435	What do you think?
11315455	11317055	You into that?
11317095	11317295	Yeah.
11317355	11317695	Okay.
11317715	11318516	Just a little feminist.
