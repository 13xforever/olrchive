00:00.000 --> 00:19.080
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

00:19.080 --> 00:22.320
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

00:22.320 --> 00:26.080
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

00:26.080 --> 00:29.340
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

00:29.340 --> 00:32.540
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

00:32.540 --> 00:36.340
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex. In this episode...

00:36.340 --> 00:43.040
Hey, are there any balls down there?

00:43.040 --> 00:45.840
About the biggest bear you've ever seen, Diggleberry.

00:45.840 --> 00:48.840
What's your favorite scary movie?

00:48.840 --> 00:52.740
Showgirls. Absolutely frightening. What's yours?

00:52.740 --> 00:55.240
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

00:55.240 --> 00:58.040
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.

00:58.040 --> 01:00.040
Now's the time on sprockets and we dodge!

01:01.040 --> 01:03.040
I don't get you, my pretty!

01:03.040 --> 01:04.540
And your little dog, too!

01:04.540 --> 01:06.040
I know kung-fu.

01:06.040 --> 01:08.540
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

01:08.540 --> 01:11.040
Why did they have to take the word gay?

01:12.040 --> 01:16.040
No! What he expects for Spanish exposition is kendo.

01:16.040 --> 01:19.040
Hey!

01:19.040 --> 01:20.040
Dark Sakurai.

01:20.040 --> 01:21.040
Shut up!

01:21.040 --> 01:24.040
Where's my gun? This is my boomstick!

01:24.040 --> 01:25.040
Skye.

01:25.040 --> 01:27.040
Come on, girls, it's time to drop the bomb!

01:27.040 --> 01:31.040
I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex with me.

01:31.040 --> 01:34.040
What kind of war human being would find that funny?

01:34.040 --> 01:36.040
Orange Lounge Radio

01:38.040 --> 01:44.040
We are live, and this is episode number 44 for May the 11th of 2003.

01:47.040 --> 01:52.040
You're tuned into the Bamani Scene's most sleep deprived radio station of all things Be Money.

02:22.040 --> 02:27.840
Also with us tonight say hello to intern zero. I can't get this fucking cookie out of the package

02:28.440 --> 02:30.480
Like pissing me off. That sounds kind of sexual

02:32.240 --> 02:34.780
Damn it. I'd now like only gonna be able to get that one out

02:36.280 --> 02:39.640
That was great Jamie went and she got the cookie out of the package and then she ate it

02:42.040 --> 02:44.040
That was almost zing worthy

02:44.400 --> 02:46.400
Nice, she got one for me

02:46.800 --> 02:49.000
Redeemed so it's just the four of us here tonight

03:19.000 --> 03:26.000
kostjamrh And they're like dark German chocolate, but it doesn't really taste like dark chocolate, between two thin cookies, and it's really good.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
kostjamrh And it tastes good too. Are these people moving?

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
kostjamrh Yeah, our neighbors are moving.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
kostjamrh Good.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
kostjamrh You don't need neighbors.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
kostjamrh Mr. Rogers isn't around anymore, we don't need neighbors.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
kostjamrh You're so nice, everyone's so nice here.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
I got his and that thingys.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
This MP3 is two and a half minutes, which for a 2DX song, that's a long-ass time.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
The intro was really long.

04:17.000 --> 04:17.500
Yeah.

04:17.500 --> 04:19.000
So it was when we go,

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Two and a half minutes?

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
Well, then it's a possibility, but it's kind of, you know, we're not saying it's official.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
We're not saying it's official, but it might be.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
And if it is official, then we were the first to play it, right?

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
So enjoy this. We're going to play this V remix by Naoki.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
And then we'll play something from Taka and something from Naoki.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
And then we'll be back.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Enjoy!

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Oh

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
Love me, you love me

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
Love me, you love me

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
You love me

10:53.000 --> 11:21.000
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

11:21.000 --> 11:30.520
I can say words in reverse, too.

11:30.520 --> 11:31.520
Do it.

11:31.520 --> 11:39.640
Mom, God and dog, radar, or that'd be radair.

11:39.640 --> 11:41.840
Race car, right?

11:41.840 --> 11:42.840
Yeah.

11:42.840 --> 11:44.840
Yeah, race car.

11:44.840 --> 11:47.200
Speaking of mom, happy Mother's Day.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.800
Happy Mother's Day, and I didn't let my mom listen to the show.

11:49.800 --> 11:53.800
to all of our mothers out there listening, which hopefully is none of them.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.800
Mom's like, I want to listen to your radio show.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.800
Um, no you don't.

11:59.800 --> 12:03.800
My mom knows I have one, but I think her and my dad made the mistake of listening to about

12:03.800 --> 12:06.800
two minutes of Undersedation Live once.

12:06.800 --> 12:09.800
And not only that, but it was the same night my sister was on too.

12:09.800 --> 12:13.800
And I think it was probably the same time that Travis was giving her the sex quiz.

12:13.800 --> 12:17.800
So needless to say, they won't be listening to any future radio projects I have.

12:17.800 --> 12:19.800
We don't do the sex quiz on this show, though.

12:19.800 --> 12:22.800
No, we don't do the sex quiz on this show, but it's still pretty bad.

12:22.800 --> 12:27.800
You know, it's too bad, though, that we do Rocky on Saturday nights, because we can't listen to Travis and Jenna.

12:27.800 --> 12:30.800
Well, I'm trying to see if they're ever going to rebroadcast their show.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.800
I know they do. They have new shows. They have spin-off shows now.

12:32.800 --> 12:36.800
They have, like, the 80s show and some club, goth club show that Travis does.

12:36.800 --> 12:39.800
So, oh, yeah, so we'll plug Understation Live, our buddy's over there.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.800
Yeah, goth talk.

12:42.800 --> 12:46.800
Hello.

12:46.800 --> 12:54.800
So, Jamie, I know you had some comments on that supposed ninth-style song.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.800
It's a piece of shit.

12:56.800 --> 13:02.800
If that was Naoki, then it means that Naoki sat on V and farted, and out that came.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.800
I'm sorry.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.800
As much as we bag on Naoki, he's very talented.

13:07.800 --> 13:10.800
And I know he could do much better than that. That is not Naoki.

13:10.800 --> 13:18.800
And anyone who thinks that that's Naoki, who actually believes that that's a Naoki remix, needs to get their head examined. Or either that or get it out of the toilet.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.800
So what are you going to do if it comes out that that's real?

13:22.800 --> 13:23.800
Are you going to have a cry?

13:24.800 --> 13:29.800
No, I'm probably never going to listen to another Naoki remix again because this is all Salva's talent.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.800
We let Paul Eteri remix it and put his name on it.

13:34.800 --> 13:37.800
Oh, maybe that's it. Maybe let Paul Eteri do all the work this time.

13:37.800 --> 13:40.200
this time

13:40.200 --> 13:42.860
i can tell that it's unique

13:42.860 --> 13:44.800
it's special

13:44.800 --> 13:45.600
um...

13:45.600 --> 13:49.440
first of all i was in band music theory and appreciation i start off as a

13:49.440 --> 13:51.240
music major

13:51.240 --> 13:54.880
i have listened to winter so many times it's not even funny

13:54.880 --> 13:58.800
and um... i could tell that the that uh... second half of the song

13:58.800 --> 14:02.020
was completely ripped from winter it was actually you know

14:02.020 --> 14:04.000
unique parts

14:04.000 --> 14:07.640
so that could is the only way i could think that that's a new mix

14:07.640 --> 14:10.880
But Naoki could do better. So much better.

14:10.880 --> 14:12.560
So I don't think that's Naoki.

14:12.560 --> 14:16.660
As like Le More et La Bierte, which is the other song we heard in there, the last

14:16.660 --> 14:20.240
song we heard in that break, which is a good Naoki song. Very good Naoki song.

14:20.240 --> 14:22.380
And in the middle there was Tomorrow Perfume.

14:22.380 --> 14:24.840
Everybody knows that one. From Taka.

14:24.840 --> 14:26.560
That song pissed me off.

14:26.560 --> 14:28.600
Why does that piss you off?

14:28.600 --> 14:31.720
Just because it's difficult. It's a seven.

14:31.720 --> 14:35.600
Have you seen the latest custom non-stop that's in our machine at Scandia? No.

14:35.600 --> 14:40.040
it's sad i mean it's like a really hard decided that one goes in the i'd i'll

14:40.040 --> 14:41.880
give you two guesses

14:41.880 --> 14:44.560
and the first guest are too many and ends with rick

14:44.560 --> 14:47.820
uh...

14:47.820 --> 14:49.400
it

14:49.400 --> 14:51.960
uh... issue let me go but one and i'd be like

14:51.960 --> 14:53.920
seven-star jamie can pass with me

14:53.920 --> 14:57.120
we have no issues on the point

14:57.120 --> 15:00.760
the uh... way to be like ones you almost passed

15:00.760 --> 15:02.360
they come really close

15:02.360 --> 15:04.760
But no, this is the songs that he has in there.

15:04.760 --> 15:12.000
Summer Vacation, Tomorrow Perfume, Traces, Xenon, and A.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.080
And you know what's really fucked about that?

15:14.080 --> 15:16.480
You can't change your speeds in the middle of the nonstop

15:16.480 --> 15:18.320
course on 8 style or whatever.

15:18.320 --> 15:19.600
When you're playing 2DX nonstops, you

15:19.600 --> 15:20.680
can't change your speed.

15:20.680 --> 15:23.520
So whatever speed you play Summer Vacation on, like I

15:23.520 --> 15:24.880
play High Speed 3, you have to.

15:24.880 --> 15:27.240
You have to play A on.

15:27.240 --> 15:27.560
What are you talking about?

15:27.560 --> 15:31.040
When you just take a hit right after, like right before A,

15:31.040 --> 15:34.000
then everything is like bullet time, just like

15:34.000 --> 15:38.780
i see the keys coming down

15:38.780 --> 15:40.560
yay

15:40.560 --> 15:44.180
you and drugs

15:44.180 --> 15:46.720
you should

15:46.720 --> 15:49.000
i'm just kidding don't do drugs, drugs are bad

15:49.000 --> 15:50.920
drugs are bad

15:50.920 --> 15:51.960
i'm very happy

15:51.960 --> 15:53.160
why are you happy?

15:53.160 --> 15:55.840
because i just had a cookie

15:55.840 --> 15:58.840
you know what that whole drugs thing reminds me of?

15:58.840 --> 16:03.840
omni crash made a song called bemoni song

16:03.840 --> 16:08.840
is that the one that sounds like the sunscreen song?

16:08.840 --> 16:13.840
yeah here we go

16:13.840 --> 16:18.840
clip don't play the whole thing please

16:18.840 --> 16:23.840
it is short but you gotta play the best part in the middle right after 100 seconds

16:23.840 --> 16:30.840
Oh, sorry. That's just me, though. No, I don't know. That song is so funny, especially when it talks about jokes.

16:30.840 --> 16:31.840
I want to hear the whole thing.

16:31.840 --> 16:36.840
You'll like it, but he can't say D-W-I. He says D-W-I.

16:36.840 --> 16:38.840
D-W-I.

16:38.840 --> 16:43.840
Okay, what we'll do to make this interesting is we'll let Loki play the whole song, and we'll make live commentary.

16:43.840 --> 16:46.840
It's just, like, funny content. I'm going to download it again.

16:46.840 --> 16:51.840
Alright, Logie's gonna find that, so we'll broadcast that to you in a little bit.

16:52.840 --> 16:57.840
What else is new? Any other Mother's Day thing? What did you guys do for Mother's Day today? Did you call your mom?

16:57.840 --> 17:00.840
I called my mom on my cell phone driving into his house.

17:00.840 --> 17:02.840
Driving into my house?

17:02.840 --> 17:07.840
I was turning to go down the street to your house and I was on the phone with my mom and I had to hang up with her.

17:07.840 --> 17:12.840
Because I'm not... I prefer not to be retarded and drive and talk on my cell phone.

17:12.840 --> 17:14.840
Because I would likely...

17:14.840 --> 17:19.840
I know you do it, and I still think it's retarded, okay?

17:19.840 --> 17:25.840
I tried to call my mom. She didn't answer her phone. I don't think she wants to hear from me today.

17:25.840 --> 17:27.840
But we only talk like once a month, so I mean-

17:27.840 --> 17:29.840
Are those your neighbors that I hate?

17:29.840 --> 17:30.840
No.

17:30.840 --> 17:31.840
The ones upstairs?

17:31.840 --> 17:32.840
No, the ones downstairs.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.840
Oh, poo. I wish the ones that I hate would move.

17:34.840 --> 17:36.840
I can go kick their door in. No, I'm just kidding.

17:36.840 --> 17:38.840
The ones that I hate?

17:38.840 --> 17:40.840
Yeah, when we met them, they were nice.

17:40.840 --> 17:41.840
The people over there?

17:41.840 --> 17:42.840
Up here.

17:42.840 --> 17:43.840
Yeah, they were.

17:43.840 --> 17:45.840
anime is better than sex

18:43.840 --> 18:45.840
I hate this political crap.

18:45.840 --> 18:46.840
Can you hear the song?

18:46.840 --> 18:48.840
Hold on, hold on.

18:49.840 --> 18:51.840
Wait, ah, what's this say?

18:52.840 --> 18:55.840
George W. Lazardo, it really does say that. That's sad.

18:55.840 --> 18:57.840
Alright, let's hear the song.

18:57.840 --> 18:59.840
There you go.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.840
Loading, loading.

19:03.840 --> 19:04.840
This is the Bimani Sims song.

19:04.840 --> 19:05.840
Can you hear that below?

19:05.840 --> 19:09.840
Bimani Rulers V was not the greatest DLOI ever.

19:09.840 --> 19:11.840
Neither is his A.

19:11.840 --> 19:13.840
We're going to do it again.

19:41.840 --> 19:44.340
sped up with different sound effects.

19:44.340 --> 19:45.340
Pretty much, yeah.

19:45.340 --> 19:48.840
Kevin is not actually a 57 metallic gray.

19:48.840 --> 19:49.840
That's debatable.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.840
Ever notice how all the best deal of the wise

19:51.840 --> 19:54.840
were made in a notepad, not set mania editor?

19:54.840 --> 19:55.840
How would you know?

19:55.840 --> 19:58.840
Kevin is only as cheesy as he wants to be.

19:58.840 --> 20:02.840
I don't, I don't, I don't.

20:02.840 --> 20:03.840
We need more LEDs-

20:03.840 --> 20:05.840
That was dumb.

20:05.840 --> 20:08.840
Last message for you.

20:08.840 --> 20:13.840
Paranoia Survivor and Paranoia Survivor Max are the same song.

20:13.840 --> 20:14.840
Thank you, yes.

20:14.840 --> 20:17.840
Stop DWIing Sakura.

20:17.840 --> 20:24.840
Anyone with a name like Dynamite Rave 68246 Ani is not to be trusted.

20:24.840 --> 20:26.840
Okay, yeah, huh?

20:26.840 --> 20:28.840
All the things she said has been done.

20:28.840 --> 20:30.840
I don't care! It's a great song.

20:30.840 --> 20:32.840
All the things she didn't say.

20:32.840 --> 20:36.840
My next two DWIs involve poltergeists and pants.

20:36.840 --> 20:40.040
X-step is the antichrist.

20:40.040 --> 20:43.240
Bemani style owns me, yes it's true.

20:43.240 --> 20:47.560
At least 100 seconds is enough time for me to get a sandwich.

20:47.560 --> 20:50.680
Moogle Hunter is on speed on possibly

20:50.680 --> 20:53.960
every other drug known to man. You know that's actually true.

20:53.960 --> 20:58.920
The world needs more spontaneous para para dancing. The background to Zenon

20:58.920 --> 21:02.960
is really stupid. Yes! Not every song needs

21:02.960 --> 21:06.600
challenge steps. That's true. I'm done.

21:06.600 --> 21:07.100
Good.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.600
Oh, you spent. Good. Shut up. I'm just kidding.

21:09.600 --> 21:14.600
You know what's funny? How come we've never had Moogle Hunter on this show? He frickin' lives not too far away.

21:14.600 --> 21:15.100
On drugs.

21:15.100 --> 21:17.600
Yeah, because he's too busy doing drugs. Apparently.

21:17.600 --> 21:21.600
And then to quote Dennis Suri, when he dies we'll smoke his ashes.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.600
Who did that song? Who gets credit for that?

21:25.600 --> 21:26.600
Omni Crash.

21:26.600 --> 21:27.600
Omni Crash.

21:28.600 --> 21:30.600
He didn't say Oni, right?

21:30.600 --> 21:32.600
Yeah, he mispronounced a bunch of words.

21:32.600 --> 21:34.600
He must be Canadian or something.

21:34.600 --> 21:35.600
Why?

21:35.600 --> 21:36.600
Is he Canadian?

21:36.600 --> 21:37.600
Yep.

21:37.600 --> 21:38.600
Because Canadian's pronouncing's funny.

21:38.600 --> 21:39.600
What the hell is circular?

21:39.600 --> 21:42.600
Yeah, he said like circular and D-U-I's.

21:42.600 --> 21:43.600
Zenon.

21:43.600 --> 21:44.600
Zenon.

21:44.600 --> 21:48.040
I think he's Canadian.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.040
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.040
Whenever you make a mistake, just pretend you're Canadian.

21:50.040 --> 21:51.040
I'm Canadian.

21:51.040 --> 21:52.040
Hey, I fucked up.

21:52.040 --> 21:57.800
I don't expect you to be smart.

21:57.800 --> 22:01.600
You should put the right emphasis on the correct syllable.

22:01.600 --> 22:08.600
uh...

22:12.040 --> 22:16.980
because he's thinking about his blood job that is getting right then

22:16.980 --> 22:20.680
and i'm thinking about it has to adapt i'm thinking about the new intro and all

22:20.680 --> 22:25.680
the clips from jamie i think that

22:25.680 --> 22:28.680
I'm going to do a video here and do a blowjob, you know, that's great.

22:45.680 --> 22:48.680
This is why you told your mom not to listen.

22:51.680 --> 22:52.680
Well, this works.

22:52.680 --> 22:56.840
street blowjobs

22:56.840 --> 23:01.600
did well that's why it is not just it would have to freeze on you

23:01.600 --> 23:05.360
he's media player

23:05.360 --> 23:08.120
in the meantime i will do a song and dance as many of you will see who are here

23:08.120 --> 23:12.400
beautiful beautiful

23:12.400 --> 23:14.760
roc did a nice dance last night

23:14.760 --> 23:17.760
i was here watching across the screen in a tutu

23:17.760 --> 23:20.980
i have never had so many people yelling at me

23:20.980 --> 23:22.180
in a tutu

23:22.180 --> 23:25.000
come to think of it i've never wanted to do before last night really it's easy to

23:25.000 --> 23:27.820
be you should have won at least the frank wager something

23:27.820 --> 23:31.080
i know i should have had a way that you were still fabulous trying to dig up a

23:31.080 --> 23:34.260
way backstage we can find one of the we literally pulled that routine out of our

23:34.260 --> 23:34.660
ass

23:34.660 --> 23:38.300
you know it's ironic to you or my outfit i want to get me up there

23:38.300 --> 23:39.780
did they try

23:39.780 --> 23:44.160
and then he tried to get me to go in for a minute that he doesn't know

23:44.160 --> 23:48.160
you know it's time you want to help

23:48.160 --> 23:54.080
a little shopping yeah what are you uh shopping for

23:59.680 --> 24:03.040
okay listen i'm gonna be honest with you do you want to uh be interested in making a little

24:03.040 --> 24:14.880
extra money hey to help you out with your shopping oh yeah okay all right then dude

24:14.880 --> 24:16.880
That looks like Arden Fair.

24:16.880 --> 24:18.880
Oh my god, it does!

24:19.880 --> 24:21.880
Now I'm following you.

24:21.880 --> 24:24.880
for some company. I just wondered if you're interested.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.880
Um, what do you have in mind?

24:26.880 --> 24:27.880
What do I have in mind?

24:27.880 --> 24:29.880
Film a server, that's not going to turn the blood off.

24:32.880 --> 24:33.880
Oh, but...

24:41.880 --> 24:44.880
So, like, out of that whole thing, there were, like, maybe two seconds of a blowjob.

24:45.880 --> 24:46.880
Dude, you should send that...

24:46.880 --> 24:47.880
Obviously an actress.

24:47.880 --> 24:49.880
You should send that to Evan for a pre-show.

24:49.880 --> 24:53.240
That totally, I swear to God that's a mall I've been to.

24:53.240 --> 24:55.360
I think it was one in L.A. though.

24:55.360 --> 24:58.660
This is the sad thing. This shows you like what a queer I am, okay?

24:58.660 --> 25:05.660
I recognize the Campbell store in the background.

25:10.160 --> 25:15.360
I want my old papa blocker back because this one sucks ass.

25:15.360 --> 25:22.360
hey while you're on that site give me the one for uh... new york

25:22.480 --> 25:25.600
yeah anyway what are we talking about before we start talking about sex

25:25.600 --> 25:28.000
oh yeah our moms um...

25:28.000 --> 25:32.620
because without that our mom we wouldn't be here today

25:32.620 --> 25:35.860
dude we were having a cool conversation though at that truck stop

25:35.860 --> 25:39.800
uh... but that's great

25:39.800 --> 25:44.800
Some people we know were likely conceived.

25:44.800 --> 25:59.800
We're talking about life being a sexually transmitted fatal disease that's hereditary.

25:59.800 --> 26:01.800
That's the secret of life?

26:01.800 --> 26:05.800
It is a sexually transmitted fatal disease that's hereditary.

26:05.800 --> 26:06.800
Think about it.

26:06.800 --> 26:07.800
It is.

26:07.800 --> 26:08.800
Hmm.

26:08.800 --> 26:09.800
Hmm.

26:09.800 --> 26:11.800
Kind of makes you think.

26:11.800 --> 26:12.800
Hmm.

26:12.800 --> 26:15.560
Things that make you go, hmm.

26:15.560 --> 26:18.280
We should have philosophical quote of the evening.

26:18.280 --> 26:20.160
I think that should be it.

26:20.160 --> 26:23.360
That could be something that we bring in for season three type thing, you know, our new

26:23.360 --> 26:25.680
and improved Orange Lounge Radio.

26:25.680 --> 26:30.440
We improve the quality of your life through higher thinking, mainly because some of us

26:30.440 --> 26:31.440
might be high.

26:31.440 --> 26:32.440
I don't know.

26:32.440 --> 26:33.440
I don't do drugs.

26:33.440 --> 26:34.440
I drink soapy.

26:34.440 --> 26:38.440
I don't do drugs either, but I do eat a lot of sugar.

26:38.440 --> 26:41.440
That stupid old people store didn't have any for pal.

26:41.440 --> 26:43.440
You went to a stupid old people's store?

26:43.440 --> 26:45.440
We went there with a price less.

26:45.440 --> 26:48.440
Oh, God, that is an old people's store. I don't know people's stores.

26:48.440 --> 26:53.440
But, like, if you need to get, you know, like, toothbrushes and all your drug store needs there,

26:53.440 --> 26:56.440
it's really cheap and you can get prescriptions, they're cheap too.

26:56.440 --> 27:01.440
That's the only store where you walk in and you have lawn furniture, lawn care, you turn the corner,

27:01.440 --> 27:06.600
have herbal, like, stuff, and then you go back around and you see nothing but prune

27:06.600 --> 27:12.920
juice and diapers. Tampons! Tampons! Tampons! Do you need a tampon, Rob? Are you feeling

27:12.920 --> 27:18.120
not so fresh? They just have diapers for that over there. And like, their soda is like one

27:18.120 --> 27:22.080
case. They don't even have like, anything. And there's like the whole section dedicated

27:22.080 --> 27:27.560
to soy and wild yam products. For women who need their energy. Spam, spam, spam, spebity

27:27.560 --> 27:33.560
No, wild yam. Women can take it when they're going through menopause to help with hot flashes.

27:33.560 --> 27:37.560
See, something that none of you people probably knew. I worked at GNC for a long time.

27:37.560 --> 27:39.560
I needed to know.

27:39.560 --> 27:46.560
Trust me, women, you're going to get through menopause in one day. Mine's 20 years off.

27:46.560 --> 27:48.560
I'm never having kids either.

27:48.560 --> 27:50.560
Dear women.

27:50.560 --> 27:54.560
Dear women, this is Jamie's herbal tip of the day.

27:54.560 --> 28:01.240
You smoke the weed, not eat it.

28:01.240 --> 28:05.100
Somebody in the chat room is insinuating that I have that not so fresh feeling.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.100
You don't.

28:06.100 --> 28:09.960
I feel, I've been feeling a little, I wouldn't say I don't feel not so fresh, I just feel

28:09.960 --> 28:10.960
not so like...

28:10.960 --> 28:16.160
See, I think, I think that Frank would have been in a better mood if he had feminine wipes.

28:16.160 --> 28:24.120
See, he was probably getting, from all of the rampant mookie that he has been known

28:24.120 --> 28:28.280
for, if he had just cleaned himself up a little bit, he wouldn't have been so itchy and would

28:28.280 --> 28:29.280
have felt a lot better.

28:29.280 --> 28:31.160
And been nicer to people.

28:31.160 --> 28:32.160
Maybe if he had a puppy.

28:32.160 --> 28:35.680
I was a little bit itchy after last night's show, because I just sweated so much.

28:35.680 --> 28:39.360
Has any of that stuff been washed?

28:39.360 --> 28:40.540
The costumes?

28:40.540 --> 28:44.400
They wash them, they don't wash them every week, but they wash them like once a month.

28:44.400 --> 28:48.400
Okay, cause I was gonna say, it's probably a good idea.

28:48.400 --> 28:50.400
I do wash my underwear.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.400
No, I wasn't talking about your underwear. I don't care about your underwear.

28:52.400 --> 28:54.400
If you want to wear itchy underwear, you can.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.400
That's your prerogative.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.400
That's my ride as an American.

28:58.400 --> 29:03.400
If I want to wear dirty underwear in public, you can't stop me.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.400
No, we'll buy you panty liners.

29:05.400 --> 29:07.400
Hey look, your neighbors are moving.

29:07.400 --> 29:09.400
Hi neighbors.

29:09.400 --> 29:11.400
No, you know why.

29:11.400 --> 29:15.720
right now is in the middle of it

29:15.720 --> 29:17.760
low-key what are you doing

29:17.760 --> 29:21.220
i was getting my acid for work because uh...

29:21.220 --> 29:25.060
i have created my computer and i'll talk about that later

29:25.060 --> 29:27.540
delay

29:27.540 --> 29:32.220
are you to make the a speed remix here at the end of the a male key remix

29:32.220 --> 29:36.560
oh yeah i know i have to find it on the internet cuz i think i know a place

29:36.560 --> 29:39.920
where it might be is going to download it from

29:39.920 --> 29:42.920
from mbz.com, you know, my butthole.

29:42.920 --> 29:53.920
See, I could probably sit on a record and fart out a better remix than that one.

29:53.920 --> 29:56.920
I'm not going to still use record player.

29:56.920 --> 30:01.920
I didn't sit on a record player, I just sit on a record.

30:01.920 --> 30:05.920
You missed movie night last week when we watched a Troma movie.

30:05.920 --> 30:07.920
When was movie night?

30:07.920 --> 30:08.920
At Evans.

30:08.920 --> 30:11.840
What'd you guys watch? I don't know what the name of the movie was

30:11.840 --> 30:15.420
I don't know. I don't remember but it was one of those trauma movies where they get all these cats

30:15.420 --> 30:17.420
No, it was Catholic schoolgirl hell

30:17.740 --> 30:21.180
That's the name of the movie. I think cool where they go into this house

30:21.180 --> 30:24.540
But there were no boobs and there was you know, the blood was made out of a1

30:26.440 --> 30:28.440
But like they go in this house and

30:29.580 --> 30:35.600
like this little boy goes in first on dare and he comes out and has a seizure and goes in the hospital and

30:35.600 --> 30:42.580
And then these girls go in to because the man who lived in the house died and the girls go in to

30:44.320 --> 30:47.760
Catalog the paintings and things with this nun the nun was cool. I

30:49.280 --> 30:53.320
Bet like that little kid went to a seizure because a priest touched him. No

30:54.920 --> 30:58.680
Oh my god the acting that was so horrible and then like no one died cool

30:58.680 --> 31:01.860
Except for the girl who got caught in a meat hook, but all they showed was her feet with a1

31:01.860 --> 31:08.700
And one girl got electrocuted, and another one got pulled into the swamp and some guy

31:08.700 --> 31:11.980
got run over.

31:11.980 --> 31:16.860
My friend Garrett has this trauma movie, Killer Condom, that he's been trying to get us to

31:16.860 --> 31:21.460
watch that for weeks and weeks, and we never seem to get around to watching it, there's

31:21.460 --> 31:25.260
always something better to do, like play pop music or something, but we're gonna watch

31:25.260 --> 31:27.300
Killer Condom one of these nights, you'll have to come watch.

31:27.300 --> 31:30.100
I'm sure Garrett would love to have you come over and watch it.

31:30.100 --> 31:39.560
you do now? My headphones are attached to a giant pile of cords. It's like, what Loki's

31:39.560 --> 31:44.100
doing right now is pulling out the Christmas tree lights at Christmas time and finding

31:44.100 --> 31:48.000
they're just in one giant pile. You know what? In my house, that never was an issue because

31:48.000 --> 31:54.080
I was evil with the twisty ties. I always hated pulling out the lights and having them

31:54.080 --> 31:59.580
be all tangly, so I would wrap them in a circle and bunch them together and twisty tie them.

31:59.580 --> 32:01.620
You're so anally-retentively fun.

32:01.620 --> 32:05.580
I bite my ass. I'll show you anal-retentive.

32:05.580 --> 32:09.740
See, what happens when you have a steel-toed boot shoved up your butt from kicking?

32:09.740 --> 32:13.680
You'll be coughin' up nails.

32:13.680 --> 32:17.780
I don't think I've ever heard you so, like, threatening on this show before.

32:17.780 --> 32:20.020
You're a badass bitch tonight.

32:20.020 --> 32:21.180
I am?

32:21.180 --> 32:23.460
Yes, you am. I didn't mean that, by the way.

32:23.460 --> 32:27.780
I mean it with puppies.

32:27.780 --> 32:29.780
Wait, you're going to kick Puppy in the ass?

32:29.780 --> 32:30.280
No.

32:30.280 --> 32:31.280
What did he do to you?

32:31.280 --> 32:32.280
You're a mean old lady.

32:32.280 --> 32:34.780
No, I'm going to get Puppy a puppy.

32:34.780 --> 32:36.280
Are you going to get Puppy a puppy?

32:36.280 --> 32:38.780
When he has somewhere, he can have a puppy.

32:38.780 --> 32:39.780
That's very nice of you.

32:39.780 --> 32:41.280
I'm sure he appreciates that.

32:41.280 --> 32:44.280
And now we have the little frowny face from Puppy in the chat room

32:44.280 --> 32:45.280
as the buffer hits him.

32:45.280 --> 32:47.280
I'm not kicking Puppy.

32:47.280 --> 32:49.280
I like Puppy right there.

32:49.280 --> 33:04.440
I didn't go there. I'm sorry I'm sorry. She did. Yeah I did, I did. Here, have some more

33:04.440 --> 33:15.440
hazelnut bites. Okay, give me. What are these? Let's re... Sorry, Loki's ass. Oops. I didn't

33:15.440 --> 33:23.040
I threw nut cream at his ass.

33:23.040 --> 33:29.380
This is Locher Quadratini Hazelnut Premium Wafer Cookies and they're filled with hazelnut

33:29.380 --> 33:30.380
cream.

33:30.380 --> 33:31.380
They're European.

33:31.380 --> 33:32.380
Number one in Italy.

33:32.380 --> 33:38.200
I got them at the old people's store.

33:38.200 --> 33:39.380
They were $2.00.

33:39.380 --> 33:41.040
They look like old people food.

33:41.040 --> 33:43.040
No, they're international.

33:43.040 --> 33:46.440
Even if you eat them, you're cultured.

33:46.440 --> 33:50.240
You sure could use it.

33:50.240 --> 33:56.920
I don't feel any culture.

33:56.920 --> 34:00.760
Hey, look, ain't I done by the guy who did Tenchi?

34:00.760 --> 34:01.760
What is that?

34:01.760 --> 34:02.760
I don't know.

34:02.760 --> 34:03.760
Masquerade?

34:03.760 --> 34:04.760
Is that what it's called?

34:04.760 --> 34:05.760
Yeah.

34:05.760 --> 34:06.760
I want to finish watching Breakin'.

34:06.760 --> 34:07.760
Let's read what Masquerade is about.

34:07.760 --> 34:08.960
Give me the nuts.

34:08.960 --> 34:10.240
Endless passion.

34:10.240 --> 34:12.000
Insatiable desire.

34:12.000 --> 34:16.060
nineteen-year-old gins family i've watched this one okay it's about this

34:16.060 --> 34:19.240
check that's going after this one guy because he has

34:19.240 --> 34:22.240
what was it the essence of permanence or something like that

34:22.240 --> 34:26.080
in other words he has golden sperm that's like proves that he's immortal

34:26.080 --> 34:27.340
and some something

34:27.340 --> 34:30.900
key of immortality anyways it's just an excuse for her to try to like

34:30.900 --> 34:32.180
get them off

34:32.180 --> 34:35.740
in which he does and then he becomes like some demon thing that bites her and

34:35.740 --> 34:37.200
so she becomes a vampire

34:37.200 --> 34:38.880
and has to like uh...

34:38.880 --> 34:41.840
live in their house with this other vampire servant that like

34:41.840 --> 34:47.840
All of a sudden gets weak, and the only way she can become stronger is by having sex, and then, uh, and the end.

34:47.840 --> 34:49.840
I wanna watch it.

34:49.840 --> 34:50.840
That was beautiful.

34:50.840 --> 34:54.840
I wanna finish watching Breakin'. We were watching Breakin' before the show.

34:54.840 --> 34:56.840
We can finish watching Breakin' after the show.

34:56.840 --> 35:00.840
But if we start watching Breakin', there's not gonna be a show, and our listeners will get mad, and they'll write us death threats.

35:00.840 --> 35:02.840
No, they won't.

35:02.840 --> 35:04.840
They'll just whine online.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.840
They can listen to the cool music.

35:06.840 --> 35:08.840
Yes, lots of cool music.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.840
They can listen along.

35:10.840 --> 35:15.840
What other 80s movies do you love, other than Breakin'?

35:15.840 --> 35:17.840
Breakin' 2, Electric Boogaloo.

35:17.840 --> 35:19.840
Sorry, did I say that again?

35:19.840 --> 35:21.840
Breakin' 2, Electric Boogaloo.

35:21.840 --> 35:29.840
I don't appoint because they can probably see us all pointing at us.

35:29.840 --> 35:32.840
And they're moving out.

35:32.840 --> 35:39.840
When I see that bed moving by, I'm like, I wonder how many times people have said sex on that bed.

35:39.840 --> 35:46.060
Did you see how old they were? I don't think they had too much sex. Just because they're old doesn't mean they don't have sex

35:46.320 --> 35:52.100
Well, that's like 50% of the old people population actually do what the fuck am I talking about? It's not an old people having sex

35:53.600 --> 35:56.480
I'm weird, you know, you're really pulling down the quality of the show

35:59.440 --> 36:03.800
All I did was sat there it just said everything you guys said over and over again

36:03.800 --> 36:06.200
So you guys talked about the chub stock truck stop

36:06.200 --> 36:08.200
But it's cool when we do it.

36:08.200 --> 36:10.860
and how we were all bored at

36:10.860 --> 36:15.640
truck stops or something like that. But it's cool when we do it.

36:15.640 --> 36:17.300
Go download more blowjobs.

36:17.300 --> 36:20.900
Go hang out at a truck stop.

36:20.900 --> 36:23.420
Wow.

36:23.420 --> 36:26.320
Wow. I think now is a good time to take a break.

36:26.320 --> 36:30.200
No. What are you doing?

36:30.200 --> 36:32.680
Oh no.

36:32.680 --> 36:34.540
Okay, uh...

36:34.540 --> 36:38.660
Let's see here.

36:38.660 --> 36:43.180
Is this going to sound like something Twen did?

36:43.180 --> 36:44.100
No, he downloaded it.

36:44.100 --> 36:44.980
Maybe.

36:44.980 --> 36:46.380
He downloaded it, Rob.

36:46.380 --> 36:47.900
He downloaded it.

36:47.900 --> 36:49.620
Downloaded it, yes.

36:49.620 --> 36:52.380
Off of LBZ.com.

36:52.380 --> 36:55.020
I have to fix something because, hold on.

36:55.020 --> 36:56.700
Oh, I'll play it after the break.

36:56.700 --> 36:59.900
OK, so this is something to look forward to.

36:59.900 --> 37:01.420
Is it the Naoki remix?

37:01.420 --> 37:03.620
Did Naoki do some pew-pews in this song and stuff?

37:33.620 --> 37:38.980
and then we'll be back in a little bit. We'll see you soon. And then we have a request from

37:38.980 --> 37:44.140
the chat room to talk about Pump It Up, which we haven't done that in a long time, so we'll

37:44.140 --> 37:51.140
talk about Pump It Up, that might be fun. Okay, so we'll be back in a little bit. Enjoy.

39:44.140 --> 39:55.540
You're standing there with your arms folded like you couldn't care

39:55.540 --> 40:00.540
Even before you glanced at me, I already felt the chemistry

40:00.540 --> 40:06.540
Don't know what it is about you that's got me feeling mesmerized

40:06.540 --> 40:12.540
I won't let you get away, boy, you're the lucky one

40:12.540 --> 40:19.540
I don't need you, cause the truth is, got my hands full of fatties

40:19.540 --> 40:25.540
But I want you, gonna put you, at the very very top of my lips

40:25.540 --> 40:48.540
I don't need you, cause the truth is, got my hands full of happiness

40:48.540 --> 40:54.540
I don't need you, cause the truth is, got my hands full of happiness

40:54.540 --> 41:00.540
But I want you, gonna put you, at the very very top of my lips

41:00.540 --> 41:07.540
Yeah, I want you, gonna have you, and that's the way it is

43:00.540 --> 43:13.540
Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of

43:13.540 --> 43:15.820
the Orange Drowned Spring Money Music and More show?

43:15.820 --> 43:23.340
The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

43:23.340 --> 43:25.540
It's unearthly.

43:25.540 --> 43:30.060
It's like being in a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

43:30.060 --> 43:32.420
Hello, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

43:32.420 --> 43:34.220
We need to find that movie again.

43:34.220 --> 43:35.540
That thing is freaking hilarious.

43:35.540 --> 43:36.340
It was pretty funny.

43:36.340 --> 43:39.260
I remember it was on Konami's official site, I think.

43:39.260 --> 43:40.820
Yeah, it was linked from there somewhere.

43:40.820 --> 43:44.100
So, Loki, did you finish downloading your A remix?

43:44.100 --> 43:46.380
Yeah, I had to figure out what I did.

43:46.380 --> 43:47.420
I had to figure out what I did, because I

43:47.420 --> 43:48.800
had to plug in my headphones just

43:48.800 --> 43:51.740
to make sure that it was the right copy, you know?

43:51.740 --> 43:53.300
So I had to hook it back up.

43:53.300 --> 43:55.640
It'll just take one second.

43:55.640 --> 43:56.140
All righty.

43:56.140 --> 43:58.980
One.

43:58.980 --> 44:00.740
Anyone seen any good movies lately?

44:00.740 --> 44:03.140
No. Have you not seen X2 yet?

44:03.140 --> 44:04.740
No. No? Not yet?

44:04.740 --> 44:06.540
I'll take you later.

44:06.540 --> 44:08.740
When? Because I want to go see it again. I don't know.

44:08.740 --> 44:11.740
But then The Matrix is coming out. I have to go see that too.

44:11.740 --> 44:12.540
So I don't know.

44:12.540 --> 44:17.180
Because I want to go see X2 again for Iceman.

44:17.180 --> 44:20.540
Hey, I'm going for my fuzzy elf.

44:20.540 --> 44:22.460
You're going for your fuzzy elf? My fuzzy elf.

44:22.460 --> 44:26.100
Who's your fuzzy elf? Nightcrawler. Nightcrawler. Do you remember how they...

44:26.100 --> 44:29.960
You never read the comics? No, of course I didn't. I watched the cartoon on Fox though.

44:29.960 --> 44:32.260
I like Jubilee. That's not even. I like Jubilee.

44:32.260 --> 44:35.600
I read the comics when all of the way out was in high school.

44:35.600 --> 44:37.120
When they were cool.

44:37.120 --> 44:41.580
Yeah, well we need to go see. Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler? Oh, he's great.

44:41.580 --> 44:45.800
Did he keep them Cumming and Cumming and Cumming? Yes, he kept us Cumming. All right.

44:45.800 --> 44:48.480
So take me tomorrow. No, no.

44:48.480 --> 44:53.280
Now, I don't know if this is a fake one because, you know, I got it off of MGZ and, you know,

46:21.820 --> 46:22.820
Wow.

46:22.820 --> 46:25.820
An Orange Lounge Radio exclusive.

46:25.820 --> 46:29.820
You know, I wonder if somebody submitted that to the Bimani-style remix contest.

46:29.820 --> 46:37.820
contest. If not, I think we need to do it on their behalf.

46:37.820 --> 46:41.820
You know what? I don't really think that was snucky. I think that it was good cool.

46:41.820 --> 46:47.820
You know what's sad is my sound card sucks ass and is brand new. I am so... I'll leave

46:47.820 --> 46:52.820
it for later. I got to make a list. Yeah, I can do that.

46:52.820 --> 46:54.820
Your sound card is number one in Italy.

46:54.820 --> 47:08.820
Your sound card is the sexiest bean tadpole on the planet.

47:08.820 --> 47:10.820
I hope somebody got that joke.

47:10.820 --> 47:11.820
Your house is hot.

47:11.820 --> 47:18.820
You know what, I think we ought to enter that remix and say it's Twin, and I bet people would believe it.

47:18.820 --> 47:22.820
No, because Twin's not talented enough to put another beat behind it.

47:22.820 --> 47:24.820
I bet he's listening.

47:25.820 --> 47:26.820
You want to say hello?

47:26.820 --> 47:28.820
Hi, Twan!

47:31.820 --> 47:34.820
With love, Orange Lounge Radio, XXLO

47:34.820 --> 47:37.820
You still ain't getting back in the chatroom.

47:39.820 --> 47:41.820
That was a good laugh.

47:43.820 --> 47:46.820
We're having a day on Orange Lounge Radio.

47:46.820 --> 47:49.820
This is so different being here. I'm sitting on a couch.

47:49.820 --> 47:50.820
Is it cool?

47:50.820 --> 47:51.820
Is it?

47:51.820 --> 47:52.820
I was laying down on the couch.

47:52.820 --> 47:55.100
You have a vanilla coke.

47:55.100 --> 47:56.460
I have a vanilla coke?

47:56.460 --> 47:57.460
It's gone.

47:57.460 --> 47:58.460
Shit!

47:58.460 --> 47:59.460
What the fuck?

47:59.460 --> 48:06.380
The vanilla coke jumped out and attacked my phone.

48:06.380 --> 48:07.940
I thought there was still stuff in it.

48:07.940 --> 48:10.300
Rob, you need a trash can by your computer.

48:10.300 --> 48:13.340
Well, I can get up and walk to the kitchen.

48:13.340 --> 48:14.340
I am capable.

48:14.340 --> 48:15.340
But you'd rather not.

48:15.340 --> 48:16.340
I say next break we open the door.

48:16.340 --> 48:17.340
Just to let air out.

48:17.340 --> 48:20.340
We need to open the door, just to let air out.

48:20.340 --> 48:21.340
Yeah, we can open the window.

48:21.340 --> 48:22.340
To let air out.

48:22.340 --> 48:23.340
To let air out in here.

48:23.340 --> 48:26.340
Or are we just trying on a fan?

48:26.340 --> 48:30.340
Save electricity, open the door.

48:30.340 --> 48:36.340
Anyway, they're saying in the chat room that we were dissing Italy.

48:36.340 --> 48:37.340
We weren't.

48:37.340 --> 48:39.340
We were reading it off a bag of cookies.

48:39.340 --> 48:42.340
This bag of cookies is number one in Italy.

48:42.340 --> 48:44.340
We need to get the webcam, no we don't need the webcam hooked up.

48:44.340 --> 48:46.340
We need a scanner.

48:46.340 --> 48:50.800
I'll scan this when I get home and put it up. We'll figure out something creative with the webcam

48:50.800 --> 48:54.460
I think we're going to do is we're gonna have the webcam and we'll just put it in the corner and pointed it away

48:54.460 --> 48:56.540
oh my god, it really is written in Italian and

48:57.540 --> 48:59.860
and Chinese it don't open it now and

49:01.820 --> 49:04.180
Holy crap, it's written in Hebrew. I

49:05.460 --> 49:11.360
Kid you not the the stuff about the the cookies is written in Hebrew look

49:11.360 --> 49:12.360
Look.

49:12.360 --> 49:13.360
That's scary.

49:13.360 --> 49:17.360
Can you read it for us?

49:17.360 --> 49:19.360
Fuck no.

49:19.360 --> 49:27.040
Well, as we promised, there's many things coming up this week that's exciting, E3 being

49:27.040 --> 49:32.600
the big one that's on everybody's minds, the Electronic Entertainment Expo or maybe I got

49:32.600 --> 49:33.600
that backwards.

49:33.600 --> 49:36.080
I don't really give a shit because I'm not going.

49:36.080 --> 49:40.960
And Jamie unfortunately isn't going because she has that job thing going on.

49:40.960 --> 49:46.960
0, it's not going. And Loki is not going either.

49:46.960 --> 49:49.960
But Dan always brings back neat stuff for you guys.

49:49.960 --> 49:53.960
Well, he hasn't been there before, but he did from that manager meeting he went to.

49:53.960 --> 49:57.960
But E3 is going to be like this big fat deal, and we're going to get a lot of Imani news next week,

49:57.960 --> 50:00.960
which is interesting because we don't really have a show next Sunday.

50:00.960 --> 50:02.960
No.

50:02.960 --> 50:06.960
But in two weeks we'll be back with episode number 45, our season 3 premiere,

50:06.960 --> 50:20.960
We will have lots to talk about from E3, because in those two weeks, there's going to be so much news it's going to make you cry, because maybe we're finally probably going to hear a confirmation on DDRXBox, whether it's legit or not, although it's looking more and more legit, because...

50:20.960 --> 50:21.960
Don't forget about 2DX USA.

50:21.960 --> 50:30.960
2DX USA rumors will finally be put to rest one way or the other, as well as Max2 USA will have lots of news, I'm sure.

50:30.960 --> 50:36.960
A friend who goes every year, always videotapes the different big booths they go to.

50:36.960 --> 50:40.960
I'm going to ask him to record a bunch of the stuff on the Bimani, thanks for me.

50:40.960 --> 50:43.960
And Metal Gear Solid 3 is going to be a big thing too.

50:43.960 --> 50:44.960
Oh my god, that was cool.

50:44.960 --> 50:45.960
Because the trailer's out now.

50:45.960 --> 50:51.960
There's also the new Metal Gear Solid for the GameCube that they're coming out with.

50:51.960 --> 50:55.960
Ooh yay, I don't know why I love my GameCube.

50:55.960 --> 50:59.960
My GameCube is my favorite system now, and I would buy that on the GameCube.

50:59.960 --> 51:09.960
They said it was like Metal Gear Solid, the first one's story with the second one's graphics in Game Boy. That's what it's supposed to be.

51:09.960 --> 51:15.960
I want to know more about that Final Fantasy game they're doing for GameCube. I hope it doesn't suck. Please don't suck. Please don't suck.

51:15.960 --> 51:18.960
And Mario Kart Double Dash, oh yeah.

51:18.960 --> 51:21.960
Squeenix is back with Nintendo.

51:21.960 --> 51:27.960
And I bet you they're going to show a lot of Final Fantasy XI stuff at E3. Although it's already out in Japan, but you know.

51:27.960 --> 51:30.960
My demo disk needs to hurry up and get to my house.

51:30.960 --> 51:32.960
Will you have a demo disk of it coming?

51:32.960 --> 51:34.960
Well, I signed up for the beta.

51:34.960 --> 51:38.960
And to be a beta tester for the PC version.

51:38.960 --> 51:45.960
And I have a feeling that I'm going to get it because I've at least played every game out there except for 4.11.

51:45.960 --> 51:53.960
And that and I've beta tested a bunch of other stuff, so I'm pretty sure to get it.

51:53.960 --> 51:56.960
And Dan signed up for the PS2 one.

51:56.960 --> 52:08.960
I'm just pissed though because I was thinking of getting the Japanese one when it came out, except that it would have been really expensive for me because I would have had to get an external hard drive for my PS2 because I have a first model Japanese one.

52:10.960 --> 52:15.960
Two hundred something dollars still and I refuse to shop at BuyRight because they suck.

52:16.960 --> 52:21.960
I was telling my friend Garrett about your BuyRight experiences because he thinks they suck too. They did something to him that picked him off.

52:21.960 --> 52:24.460
off.

52:24.460 --> 52:25.840
They really suck a big ass.

52:25.840 --> 52:26.920
Never shot from Bi-Rite.

52:26.920 --> 52:27.920
I know.

52:27.920 --> 52:28.920
Would you explain this to me?

52:28.920 --> 52:31.820
I kind of know what it is, but I thought our listeners might benefit.

52:31.820 --> 52:34.040
The difference between, because I know this is your beef with Bi-Rite, the difference

52:34.040 --> 52:37.760
between buying a game that's Asia and buying a game that's Japan.

52:37.760 --> 52:44.400
There's really not a difference in the game itself, but when you get your manual, it's

52:44.400 --> 52:51.160
going to be written all in, I think it's Mandarin Chinese, as opposed to being written in Japanese.

52:51.160 --> 52:56.440
And for me it was a big thing because I would have at least a chance of reading a Japanese

52:56.440 --> 52:59.660
manual instead of one written in Chinese.

52:59.660 --> 53:05.800
And the other thing is, is that I could have gone to YesAsia and gotten it for $30 cheaper.

53:05.800 --> 53:09.760
Instead I paid more and there it went.

53:09.760 --> 53:10.760
But I see that a lot.

53:10.760 --> 53:15.360
Like I was looking around at stuff on NCSX the other night and they have Asia, Japan,

53:15.360 --> 53:18.920
they have it pretty clearly defined the differences between the two when you're buying them.

53:18.920 --> 53:20.920
That's why it's good to shop at NCSX.

53:20.920 --> 53:26.160
Um, but I was just, you know, I was kind of curious what the difference is, and, you know, I thought maybe our listeners could benefit from that too.

53:26.160 --> 53:30.040
They should just never shop from BuyRight. And also if you sign up for their mailing list at all.

53:30.040 --> 53:33.680
Because somehow they signed me up for it when I emailed a question.

53:33.680 --> 53:39.880
They, I've, I've submitted so many times. Threatened legal action, because you can actually sue them for that.

53:39.880 --> 53:44.200
Um, and they haven't removed me, so I blocked. That's part of the reason why my Dr. Soccer mail is blocked.

53:44.200 --> 53:46.480
Ah, I got it. But, um,

53:46.480 --> 53:50.320
I'm actually going to get on the line one day and call them,

53:50.320 --> 53:54.480
and tell them that if they do not remove my name for their mailing list that I am going to press charges.

53:54.480 --> 53:55.680
And I will!

53:55.680 --> 53:58.320
You know, well that's going to be a law in California pretty soon about the whole

53:58.320 --> 53:59.520
you can

53:59.520 --> 54:02.560
sue them for five hundred dollars or something like that. It's crazy.

54:02.560 --> 54:05.260
And you get a hundred dollars of that?

54:05.260 --> 54:08.480
No, I'm sorry, you get the state to give them a fine. The state can

54:08.480 --> 54:10.760
fine them for that and you get a hundred dollars of that.

54:10.760 --> 54:12.720
That's awesome.

54:12.720 --> 54:19.040
All the spam lists? Uh-huh. Uh-uh. I'm going to save every last one of them.

54:19.040 --> 54:20.040
I'd be rich.

54:20.040 --> 54:21.040
Yep.

54:21.040 --> 54:22.040
What else?

54:22.040 --> 54:25.040
Oh, yes, Logie.

54:25.040 --> 54:26.920
I hate you Creative Lab.

54:26.920 --> 54:27.920
You can die.

54:27.920 --> 54:31.320
I'll get into that later.

54:31.320 --> 54:32.660
Okay.

54:32.660 --> 54:35.520
Also coming up this weekend, big, big, big, big news.

54:35.520 --> 54:37.480
This is something we will be attending.

54:37.480 --> 54:42.240
That's B3, the other three thing, and that's this weekend.

54:42.240 --> 54:45.120
Whatever happened to C3 and D3?

54:45.120 --> 54:46.120
I don't know.

54:46.120 --> 54:47.120
Maybe they happened in your chat.

54:47.120 --> 54:48.120
C4 blew up C3.

54:48.120 --> 54:52.200
was a c3 m movie with chris rock

54:52.200 --> 54:55.440

55:15.900 --> 55:21.220
B3 is going to be this huge-ass tournament that's going on and it's taken place in San

55:21.220 --> 55:25.060

55:25.060 --> 55:32.980
It's Perfect Attack, Freestyle, Dance Maniacs, and B Mania 3.

55:32.980 --> 55:36.940
I think there was something else going on, I probably forgot, but you can get onto DDR

55:36.940 --> 55:41.620
Free, you can check the official tournament thread for more information on that.

55:41.620 --> 55:48.620

55:49.700 --> 55:52.500

work out, but hopefully we do. But we'll be coming to you all day long on Saturday for

55:56.500 --> 56:01.500

56:36.280 --> 56:40.160
My microphone's really loud now.

56:40.160 --> 56:41.160
Where were we?

56:41.160 --> 56:42.160
Yes, B3, all those companies.

56:42.160 --> 56:44.240
We're going to have a really good location Saturday from what I understand.

56:44.240 --> 56:45.240
That's going to be awesome.

56:45.240 --> 56:46.240
You can't freaking...

56:46.240 --> 56:48.040
Are they going to feed us?

56:48.040 --> 56:49.040
I don't know.

56:49.040 --> 56:52.400
I don't think they're going to feed us, but I hear we get other perks, but I can't say

56:52.400 --> 56:54.280
what those are yet, but I'll tell you off air.

56:54.280 --> 56:55.280
Ooh.

56:55.280 --> 56:56.280
There's some cool things.

56:56.280 --> 56:57.760
So we get free man servants.

56:57.760 --> 56:58.760
Ooh.

56:58.760 --> 57:00.080
I don't want a man servant.

57:00.080 --> 57:03.000
That's weak sauce, man.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
We have intern zero.

57:04.000 --> 57:05.000
We don't need another man-servant.

57:05.000 --> 57:08.560
I'm talking about naked men-servants.

57:08.560 --> 57:12.560
I'm talking about harem-men.

57:12.560 --> 57:15.200
Maybe we can talk puppy or something into being a man-servant.

57:15.200 --> 57:19.040
I don't want puppy to be a harem-man.

57:19.040 --> 57:23.440
I want my harem-man to- Because we're going to be celebrities at

57:23.440 --> 57:24.440
B3.

57:24.440 --> 57:27.640
We need to have like Insta on a trailer.

57:27.640 --> 57:29.580
We're the Orange Lounge radio people.

57:29.580 --> 57:30.580
We're celebrities now.

57:30.580 --> 57:33.320
We need people coming to our booth asking for autographs and we go,

57:33.320 --> 57:37.640
Sorry, no time, no time. See my publicist. Call me. We'll do lunch. Blah, blah, blah.

57:37.640 --> 57:42.440
I'm still thinking about auctioning off my bat.

57:42.440 --> 57:43.440
At the tournament?

57:43.440 --> 57:45.200
Maybe we should auction off my bat at the tournament.

57:45.200 --> 57:50.200
Aren't you going to be sad to see that go?

57:50.200 --> 57:53.200
Yes, I will.

57:53.200 --> 57:59.200
How could I ever consider getting rid of my beloved bat? Dude, they're moving tables now.

57:59.200 --> 58:02.360
Bye, neighbors!

58:02.360 --> 58:05.760
We already have people in the chat room claiming dibs on the orange bat.

58:05.760 --> 58:07.200
So maybe look forward to that.

58:07.200 --> 58:09.080
Maybe we'll do a silent auction for my bat.

58:09.080 --> 58:11.760
Are we giving away door prizes?

58:11.760 --> 58:12.760
Don't know?

58:12.760 --> 58:13.760
Maybe.

58:13.760 --> 58:14.760
Hopefully a few.

58:14.760 --> 58:15.760
We at least have that one box of stuff, right?

58:15.760 --> 58:16.760
The one that you wanted to...

58:16.760 --> 58:17.760
Make up my circle.

58:17.760 --> 58:18.760
Okay.

58:18.760 --> 58:21.520
I think we should do a silent auction for the orange bat.

58:21.520 --> 58:22.520
Okay.

58:22.520 --> 58:24.160
So you're thinking about a silent auction for the orange bat?

58:24.160 --> 58:25.240
You should do one for yours.

58:25.240 --> 58:28.200
We should auction off your bat to you, signed by us.

58:28.200 --> 58:29.200
We could do that.

58:29.200 --> 58:30.200
The host.

58:30.200 --> 58:31.200
Okay.

58:31.200 --> 58:32.200
And then you would have to go get your bats.

58:32.200 --> 58:37.200
And then we can enter and do a routine at the biggest tournament in NorCal.

58:37.200 --> 58:38.200
No!

58:38.200 --> 58:41.920
Okay, so we're probably going to do a silent auction for Jamie's Bat and My Bat, so that's

58:41.920 --> 58:42.920
something to look forward to.

58:42.920 --> 58:46.280
We are going to be giving away some door prizes, we don't know how many, but we'll be giving

58:46.280 --> 58:47.280
away some.

58:47.280 --> 58:50.400
So stop by our table, maybe we'll do like a random drawing or something like, come get

58:50.400 --> 58:52.640
interviewed on the show and get a ticket in the drawing.

58:52.640 --> 58:56.040
Maybe we'll do something like that, that'll be fun.

58:56.040 --> 58:58.720
And yeah, so definitely look for us.

58:58.720 --> 59:01.840
But except, it can't just be come be interviewed on the show, like we have to interview them

59:01.840 --> 59:04.960
and ask them really humiliating questions.

59:04.960 --> 59:07.360
I just remembered that one question on the sex quiz.

59:07.360 --> 59:11.240
I'll ask Travis if maybe we can borrow the sex quiz, if he wouldn't mind.

59:11.240 --> 59:14.640
Shrimping.

59:14.640 --> 59:15.840
Rusty trombone.

59:15.840 --> 59:19.160
Take the sex quiz, win a DVD, maybe?

59:19.160 --> 59:22.920
Maybe.

59:22.920 --> 59:26.680
Take the sex quiz, get spanked by Rob.

59:26.680 --> 59:28.700
Bring a paddle.

59:28.700 --> 59:32.060

we can see if we can borrow one out of the what the hell that's why i think

01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:10.640
creative labs has every single version of the sound blaster listed on their

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.500

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:25.340

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:39.980
The

01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:43.180
chat room is suggesting that I cosplay Mr. Spanky for B3.

01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:52.180
And you know what's scary is I have seen that exact thing that Mr. Spanky wears in a leather store in San Francisco on Folsom Street.

01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:54.180
So I could go buy it.

01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:58.180
Rob, we've seen you in a corset, Rob.

01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:01.180
You need to do Dr. Dick.

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:03.180
You need to go up there as Frank.

01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:07.180
I have contemplated doing a Dr. Dick routine, however I have no time to plan one.

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:10.180
Who needs to plan one?

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:13.180
cuz this is B3 and I feel like I should put some effort into it.

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:16.180
I don't know if I even can compete. Technically we're staff. I might not be able to compete.

01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:18.180
Let's not worry about it.

01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:20.180
We'll do an exhibition.

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:25.180
Ooh exhibitionism. Dr. Dick does an exhibitionism. That's an exciting idea.

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:34.180
But I have to find some big, I have to find like a big fur coat and some shiny shirts and things like that.

01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:39.180
I'll have to go shopping at some gay stores this week and see what I can find.

01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:41.180
I should buy my costume at Naughty and Nice.

01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:44.180
Who are the Goldies?

01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:47.180
Dr. Dick in Mantis.

01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:49.180
We'll get you a school uniform.

01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:51.180
I could dress up like an Asian schoolgirl.

01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:53.180
We could do Battle Royale.

01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:55.180
Ooh. What would be a good song?

01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:58.180
Oh my god, I downloaded a high resolution scan of the collar.

01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:04.180
What would be a fun freestyle song for Battle Royale?

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:08.180
Like all of us could get up there and we could keep killing each other off during the song?

01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:10.180
Dead End?

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:14.180
dukeofthebump

01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:47.180
I've been helping him gain levels because I am so happy because I have a plus five stiletto now.

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:49.180
And that means in English?

01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:52.180
That means I can kill things faster and have them kill me less.

01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:54.180
Cool.

01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:59.180
If there was this one critter, it would take me a whole life bar to kill and now I can kill five of them.

01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:01.180
Very nice. Congratulations.

01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:05.180
I'm a nerd.

01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:32.180
LOKI and I wanted to talk about G4 real fast, because we got cable a couple weeks ago, I think you remember on the show we were talking about how we just got cable, so we've had a little time now to actually watch some G4, and this is television for gamers, and we know that a lot of you don't have G4, so we thought we'd talk to you, we thought LOKI and I would talk to you about what we've seen on G4, what's cool and what sucks.

01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:37.180
Okay, what's cool? First off, best show on all of G4? StarCade.

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:39.180
StarCade rocks.

01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:47.180
Old school game show from 83 where they play video games like Pac-Man and Pango and Pole Position, and they win video games.

01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:48.180
They win arcade machines.

01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:50.180
Hands down the best show on G4.

01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:53.180
Okay, now what sucks about G4, Loki?

01:03:53.180 --> 01:04:02.180
Well, actually, there's one more good show on there. It's called, uh, that's called, like, Electric Play or something like that, or something like that.

01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:11.180
It's where they review only action games. It's pretty cool. And they do these little skit things that are kind of funny. Those are mildly entertaining.

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:21.180
Now, what really sucks, um, is this one show, Portal, is the gayest show I've ever seen. Seriously, this guy that looks like...

01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:23.160
Wait a minute, gayer than queerest folk?

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:24.540
Yes, it's pretty bad.

01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:28.700
It's like, OK, this guy is like, I

01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:31.100
would say he's pretty much like the gamer

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:33.860
version of Blue's Clues.

01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:37.100
This guy is just sitting there talking to nobody,

01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:39.740
except for this imaginary computer thing that's

01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:42.620
supposedly in the studio that talks to him about really

01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:44.940
stupid things, and they're making it sound all high tech

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:45.780
and cool.

01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:48.540
And all he does is he talks about different cities

01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:50.860
and towns and stuff that are in online games.

01:04:50.860 --> 01:05:08.860
Then they do this stupid little, like, skit where they have these people walking around or whatever in, like, online games, and they're, like, making them talk, you know, dubbing over their voices and doing little stories. It's really retarded. It is just dumb. It is damn awful.

01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:17.860
That sounded like, um, an idea that I was gonna do for a Ragnarok Online fan comic.

01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:20.860
Yeah, that game sucks.

01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:21.860
It's dumb to watch on the show.

01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:24.860
This game called High Score really sucks.

01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:30.860
It's some, like, UK version of Starrcade, but, you know, obvious.

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:31.860
Starrcade!

01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:32.860
It's just crap.

01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:37.860
And then Nick Arcade isn't on G4, but it is on Nickelodeon Gas,

01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:39.860
Games and Sports, Nick Gas.

01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:45.860
Yeah, and also what really sucks is they've got these stupid commercials

01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:51.860
The commercials where they show the Twin Galaxies world records for like these two games.

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:52.860
Two games, they have like...

01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:57.860
That's old school Orange Lounge topics right there talking about Twin Galaxies and their old DDR.

01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:00.860
They're just awful, awful, awful.

01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:04.860
But I'll have you know though that they did, what was it?

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:09.860
Entertainment Weekly and G4 did the top 100 games of all time.

01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:13.860
And Dance Dancer Revolution was number 40, I think.

01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:14.860
What was number one?

01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:21.080
Legend Zelda. I forget what number two was. There was another series. Another series.

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:28.420
Guardian Legend wasn't on the list. Those bastards at all. Was ET on there? No. What

01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:36.580
about Custer's Revenge? No. No. What else? There's a few that were really stupid that

01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:44.280
beat up like other ones. Like Grand Theft Auto was under, I can't remember. There's

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:46.500
just a lot of really dumb games on the list.

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:52.140
Maybe I could find that list online somewhere. Maybe it's on G4. I'll see if I can find it.

01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:54.420
Keep talking about G4 while I look for this list.

01:06:54.420 --> 01:06:58.780
Then they have like these stupid like intimate moments with Laura Croft where there's this

01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:05.380
guy talking to her and it's just like retarded. I mean, this guy is like talking to the chick

01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:09.620
that's supposedly next to him and he's not making a play at all. I mean, what a loser.

01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:13.340
If there's going to be some, like, you know, intimate moments, I want to see some intimate

01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:19.260
moments, I want to see this, hi, don't you hate it that people think that, you know,

01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:25.100
your unintelligent stuff, he should be like, bitch, get down on my lap, you know, stuff

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:30.700
like that. Because, I mean, it's just really awful, really awful TV. And then they have

01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:35.020
these stupid screenshots, they do have different games and stuff and that was awful and it's

01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:37.020
p0k3smot42o 1 dude just got a total jackass

01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:37.820
You about to fall asleep, Jamie?

01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:38.820
We need to do Fuck You's of the Week.

01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:41.660
Do you want to do the Cage Mash now, or do you want to do Fuck You's now?

01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:42.660
Huh?

01:08:42.660 --> 01:08:44.660
You want to do Fuck You's now?

01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:45.660
Excuse you!

01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:46.660
I'm just kidding.

01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:49.560
Uh, we'll take a quick break and we'll come back and do the Fuck You's of the Week.

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:52.060
So why don't you go ahead and send those to me in the chat room.

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:53.060
Hello, I'm Skye.

01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:54.780
I'm sitting in the chat room right now.

01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:55.780
Huh?

01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:56.780
Play Angry Thing.

01:08:56.780 --> 01:08:57.780
Play Angry Thing.

01:08:57.780 --> 01:08:58.780
I'm going to play some...

01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:00.780
I'm going to play...

01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:01.780
Wait.

01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:02.780
There's quite a difference between those.

01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:03.980
I'm going to play Show You.

01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:05.340
Jamie says, play show tunes.

01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:06.580
What songs are show tunish?

01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:11.900
My god, I don't know what songs those are.

01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:12.900
Can I play angry songs?

01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:14.840
I can find those easier.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:18.820
OK, I have to play all tack?

01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:20.340
All right, we'll take a tack break.

01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:26.420
We'll take a tic-tac break.

01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:28.500
And then we'll be back.

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:29.620
Yes, we will.

01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:31.220
I have to find some tack stuff first.

01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:33.020
Hold on.

01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:37.300
Okay, yes, we're gonna play some tag, and then we'll be back, so send those FUs to me.

01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:40.940
You rhymed, that was cool. I'm Skye. Tag in bed.

01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:46.500
I'm in the chat room as Skye. If you aren't in our chat room, you should be. Get your

01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:53.780
ass over there. Go over to www.calibomani.com, click on orange lounge, and then click on

01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:57.140
chat. And while you're at calibomani.com... Did you say chat?

01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:59.540
Visit our forums. What? You said chat.

01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:32.240
pump it up is korean

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:35.000
uh... we'll be back we'll talk about pump it up a little later

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:35.660
it's

01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:38.620
we're teasing it so that you have to keep listening

01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:41.660
quit playing crap so i can play the break music

01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:44.340
para para dance

01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:47.140
what the fuck is this

01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:48.620
uh... what's this

01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:49.120
Stelly.

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:49.620
Oh.

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:21.120
I

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:21.120
Oh

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:26.840
in

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:34.080
ok

01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:37.180
it

01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:38.560
it

01:15:38.560 --> 01:16:07.560
I'm gonna be a little bit disturbed, guys.

01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:12.560
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:19.560
Do we care what people think of us?

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:20.560
No!

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:25.560
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:26.560
Yeah!

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:31.960
Extreme Bimani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:36.280
Hi, we are back now.

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:38.280
oops, sorry about that.

01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:40.080
We're having some technical difficulties there.

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:42.040
Loki and I are trying to share our computers here,

01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:44.480
and it's fucking things up.

01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:47.040
But we're back.

01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:47.800
Yay.

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:49.720
Yay.

01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:51.320
I'm so excited that we're back.

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:54.440
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it.

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:56.400
Let's see.

01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:57.880
Jamie, let's talk about Pump It Up,

01:16:57.880 --> 01:16:59.200
because Chad wanted us to talk about Pump It Up.

01:16:59.200 --> 01:16:59.680
It's Korean.

01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:00.960
And we haven't in a while.

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:01.560
It's Korean.

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:02.000
What do you think?

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:02.680
Do you like it?

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:03.440
You hate it?

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:05.360
I like it, but it's Korean.

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:06.360
what's that mean

01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:08.140
it's korean

01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:11.300
okay i hated the version that was at uh... new york new york

01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:13.400
was in vegas oh my god

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:14.680
or personal

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:17.480
the stages so messed up

01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:19.640
it kept going past the front i wanted kids

01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:21.500
every time you stepped on it it would hit you

01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:25.220
and they're like a bajillion songs in the game is like one of the last ones out

01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:26.300
and then

01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:29.900
i couldn't find the songs i wanted it took me forever to find one to you

01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:33.280
and then i killed automatically due to the difficulty is sucked

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:37.040
But, I mean, I like Pump It Up, though. I hate playing caution on Pump It Up, though.

01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:39.920
Because it's so slow.

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:43.360
Um, my thoughts on Pump It Up, I absolutely hated the game when I first

01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:47.420
played it, and I'll tell you why. The interface sucks

01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:51.040
on all versions, because they don't- you have to use your feet to move around, and it's

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:52.760
too slow. I mean, I like

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:56.560
on DDR how you can really fastly throw through the songs. Even on 4th Mix, you can move through

01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:58.680
the songs a hell of a lot faster than you can

01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:01.400
and pump it up, and that just pisses me off. I shouldn't have to stand there for five minutes

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:02.760
trying to select my song.

01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:04.760
i know you can

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:07.400
i mean so whatever but other than that

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:10.800
it's alright i mean the videos in the back of pretty cool i want to take on me

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:14.200
was the best of some of the songs are pretty cool i really like to the songs

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:15.160
and pump it up

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:18.880
and uh... you know i could be extreme i think it takes a lot of crap

01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:23.520
but it's really horrible interface hurts it a lot more than it really should

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:26.020
a lot of people are just turned off by the

01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:28.920
it's just not easy to use

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:31.920
That's just if we had DDR on a big screen like that.

01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:34.920
I've seen it.

01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:36.920
It'd be pretty.

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:39.920
No it doesn't.

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:41.920
Pump It Up does not suck.

01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:44.920
Why do you think Pump It Up sucks, Zero?

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:53.920
Well, one reason why I think it absolutely sucks is the interface does suck.

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:58.920
I mean, I can play this, I can play the game, and there's a couple good songs that I like.

01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:04.920
Half the other songs are trash, the damn thing takes forever to load after a song.

01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:10.920
I gotta stand there for 45 seconds just to take 30 seconds to pick a song.

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:15.920
I don't really like having to, I don't like playing diagonal instead of up and down, left and right.

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:20.920
You know what though, the diagonal thing, for some reason it makes freestyling a lot more natural.

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:21.920
Because it makes you freestyle.

01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:25.920
Yeah, but I think that's kind of cool. That's one thing I like about Pump It Up. Yeah, I think that's the point.

01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:42.920
I mean, I think DDR could actually use maybe some type of the style of the videos that are in Pump It Up on some, and there's some that are horrible, but I think that there's a lot of ideas DDR can take from Pump.

01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:45.920
The same thing what Pump could take from DDR.

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:55.920
Like, yeah, having just an easier interface, being able to choose your songs quicker, and possibly changing their hardware so that you don't have to stand around for a month.

01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:58.920
Isn't a Pump It Up machine just a big computer inside that box?

01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:00.920
Yeah, that's what I heard. It's just a big PC in there.

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:06.920
They could have changed that if they really wanted to. It would have been a little bit easier for everyone else.

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:08.920
I've played a game that's worse, though.

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:09.920
What?

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:11.920
And, God, I can't remember the name of it. It was put up by Jalego.

01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:17.820
Take no motion not taking motion. No what it is. They have one at this bowling alley. I went to in Hayward

01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:19.720
but um

01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:25.420
It's got three monitors middle monitors the videos, and it's like it looks like one of those make your own video things

01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:29.120
Huh people doing really crappy dances wear really crappy clothes

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:34.580
But it's got like you know how somebody amigo how your maraca places are shut are set up

01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:39.560
Well, it's like that on the floor, and you do your steps like that, and they're different colors that tells you where to go

01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:40.560
What's that game called?

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:45.560
Is it put out by the people who did Someday We Go?

01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:46.560
It's by Jaleco.

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:47.560
Do a search.

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:48.560
Weird.

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:50.560
Do a search real quick.

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:55.560
Hold on just a sec because I'm queuing up some of the stuff for later in the show.

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:57.220
I missed playing Techno Motion.

01:20:57.220 --> 01:20:58.480
They have one at Excalibur.

01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:00.480
I missed playing it.

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:03.860
Thank you for bringing that up, Logie.

01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:08.500
That's why I wanted to bring up what's cooler than Pump It Up is the game that the same

01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:17.120
company made called Dance Station 3DDX and the way it looks is so cool because instead

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:23.300
of the arrows that are set in, you know how the buttons are kind of sunk into the pad

01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:24.300
a little bit?

01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:30.780
Well, the way 3DDX is, and the same thing with EZDancer, is it's a big black panel that's

01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:34.960
over the whole thing and then different areas of it light up so it's a big flat panel.

01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:38.240
So it kind of makes finding the buttons a little harder but it kind of adds a challenge

01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:42.600
of the game. Well, in 3DDX, not only that, but there's para-like sensors all around the

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:47.320
sides so you have to wave your arms too to play. It's awesome. And it has such songs

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:53.680
as Jenny in a Bottle. And that game makes you freestyle. I got to adjust the volume

01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:59.840
on this one. Yes, that game makes you freestyle. I don't talk very loud. Here, look, if you

01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:03.400
You can use this one.

01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:06.280
Don't change it too much.

01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:07.280
What was I looking for?

01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:08.280
Shoot.

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:13.280
Hey, they're number one in Italy.

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:16.800
Okay, so are we about ready for the FUs of the week?

01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:17.800
Sure.

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:18.800
Why not?

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:19.800
Here we go.

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:22.800
Jamie, you know what to do.

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:44.060
My first one, my first few of the week goes to being tired and not sleeping.

01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:52.660
My other one goes toward my poor body for being sore after Rocky last night and I don't

01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:55.660
I don't know. I'm not really all that angsty.

01:22:55.660 --> 01:22:57.660
Gasp!

01:22:57.660 --> 01:23:04.660
Well, there's the usual, like, the idiot drivers and driving here to do the show.

01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:07.660
Driving to South Sac and run up here.

01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:09.660
Love you, Jamie.

01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:11.660
He got me food, so he's forgiven.

01:23:11.660 --> 01:23:15.660
I was teasing anyway.

01:23:15.660 --> 01:23:18.660
One of them goes to...

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:22.660
I love my fiance a whole lot, but he ate a whole box of Life cereal and I didn't get any.

01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:26.660
Was it Cinnamon Life? Because Cinnamon Life is the best.

01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:28.660
Cinnamon Life sucks, it's normal.

01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:30.660
If he ate the whole box of Cinnamon Life, that is a crime.

01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:32.660
That's okay, I found another box though.

01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:33.660
Because I thought they were super-five.

01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:34.660
Cinnamon Life is the show.

01:23:34.660 --> 01:23:35.660
I hate Cinnamon Life.

01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:37.660
What is wrong with you?

01:23:38.660 --> 01:23:42.660
Thank you, Cinnamon Life tastes like shit.

01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:44.660
I like the normal one.

01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:52.660
I don't like oddly flavored cereals. I like crackle and oat bran. I'll put it that way. I like grape nuts. I like total.

01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:58.660
When I was a little kid, I ate adult cereals. And I hate marshmallows. Fuck marshmallows, okay? Because they're nasty.

01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:06.660
And, um... I guess that's it. Yeah, I'm tired. I'm being tired.

01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:08.660
Next

01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:50.660
I don't know what's wrong with it. It's pissing me off, because I'm looking on their site to find drivers, and they don't have any drivers for this car, because the car doesn't exist according to their site, which is also really annoying.

01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:55.660
So, I had to find drivers for this somewhere. I'm thinking that's probably what the problem is for it.

01:24:55.660 --> 01:25:01.260
So I've even my sound card to the sucks also since we're on the subject of that every my motherboard because you know

01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:05.660
I like I got this nice motherboard and processor combo. It's supposed to be an AMD

01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:11.060
2200 well, it's supposed to be you know, ready about you know, two gigahertz or whatever. It's running at 135

01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:20.300
My old processor was faster than that. So I basically paid $300 or no $150 for a downgrade

01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:27.300
Thank you, fries. You can suck ass.

01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:30.300
Let's also talk about old people.

01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:36.300
I had an encounter with this really old bag that was at release,

01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:39.300
and I was just waiting in line to get some Chinese food,

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:40.300
and she's pushing her cart.

01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:45.300
Oh, I'm old!

01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:48.300
Cutting right in front of us, and then stupid Chinese lady,

01:25:48.300 --> 01:26:08.980
Chinese lady she freaking you know and so I'm sitting here going yeah I guess

01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:14.980
we don't need lines and the stupid bitch in front me started saying and I just

01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:19.380
story jr out there and i think that you're not talking you can you agree

01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:20.860
and then uh...

01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:24.260
so you know i feel a little bit because then she didn't even know she wanted in

01:26:24.260 --> 01:26:27.100
your arms when you're on come on come on come on come on move move move move

01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:31.000
come on come on come on you're old come on move

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.320
wasted like a good

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:35.980
extra half an hour than i really needed

01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:38.400
so now i am also

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:41.660
and at the two uh... stupid drivers

01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:43.060
but then it

01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:51.060
There's this road down here, and everyone backs up because they want to turn, because it backs up a good half a mile, because people want to turn.

01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:56.060
Well, these stupid people don't realize, oh, I have to get in that way to turn? Yeah, well, there would be more there.

01:26:56.060 --> 01:27:01.060
So they stop in the middle of your lane, trying to turn over, and won't move out of the way.

01:27:01.060 --> 01:27:08.060
Then I had another jackass when I went to McDonald's yesterday, who was checking his food in the middle of the parking lot.

01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:11.060
direct middle of the parking lot, I couldn't go around him because he was sitting in the way

01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:12.060
and he's just kinda going

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:15.060
du-du-du-du-du..

01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:20.060
So, I view that

01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:23.060
anyway the people on Ain't It Cool News for giving away the ending of The Matrix

01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:25.060
they keep trying to read reviews on stuff

01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:28.060
and they keep giving away the end of The Matrix and it's like sneaking up on me

01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:30.060
I keep finding out more stuff I don't want to know about it

01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:31.060
and it's really annoying

01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:34.060
But I only have four more days until I get to go see the movie

01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:35.060
which reminds me, uh...

01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:36.060
my girlfriend doesn't really want to go

01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:37.560
so I have an extra ticket if anyone wants to go with me

01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:44.560
go with me

01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:47.920
policy here and by forty five

01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:51.400
that's the only thing that's right over there

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:55.240
uh... and then uh... if you to my website

01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:56.940
who's gone

01:27:56.940 --> 01:27:58.740
it's gone for good

01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:03.520
no say it's gone my hosting died and i'm not going to pay for hosting and it

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:04.960
it saves me time that way

01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:07.440
so i don't have to work on my website anymore

01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:10.960
so what, i mean i guess what you know you can just find your web your stupid files

01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:14.240
anywhere else on the web because i'm not responsible for doing your searching for

01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:14.920
you

01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:18.680
i don't give a shit anymore you know because you don't do anything you don't help me out

01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:20.400
so um...

01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:23.640
you consider a bastard you can go ahead and find your files on the web like i do

01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:25.640
and spend time like i do

01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:28.200
and you know what it builds character you know

01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:31.040
the hard works character

01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:36.040
hard work. So if you want a huge sim collection like mine, you can go suck ass because you're

01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:39.880
never going to find it because most files are off the internet. So ha, I laugh at you

01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:44.880
because I have a large collection and you do, I have a large collection and you do.

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:51.880
So yeah. And um, yeah I have Asian porn. That was cool. But um, I have Asian porn because

01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:59.620
it's censored. That sucks. They have hot Asian chicks and they're like all blocky. Looks

01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:06.620
like a mosaic attacking them. That's not cool. So I think I'm done. You know, it's just that

01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:11.160
pisses me off that my site's gone, because I really like my site, and you know, but I'm

01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:15.520
just not going to know. Maybe I'll come back. You never know, because my friend who does

01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:19.400
my hosting for me says that sometimes the web server goes down and it comes back up,

01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:22.640
so it may reappear and then everything will be fine, but.

01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:27.200
And what do you have to say to those that say that the point of Leech from Loki is to,

01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:30.600
who, in fact, leech from Loki.

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:34.960
The point is that I left space for people to put files up so that people can leech from

01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:37.680
my site, but no one put any files up.

01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:38.680
And for that you must die.

01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:43.600
And for that you must die, and I know the whole purpose of getting files, but really

01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:47.960
all the files I had on there I got from like DDRUK anyways, so go get them from them.

01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:50.360
Shit, this is like, what?

01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:54.480
Seriously, Bomani Sims of DDRUK is pretty much where I got all my files, there wasn't

01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:59.360
anything new on there yet. I mean, I was planning on it. I just never got around to it. So now

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:04.000
I have more time to make cool files. I mean, you should think of it as like an advantage

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.360
because you get to see my files anyways.

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:06.360
Yeah, more times to remix.

01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:10.600
Yeah. Well, yeah, if the sound card works.

01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:11.600
Okay, I'm done.

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:13.600
All right, you're done.

01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:14.600
My turn.

01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:19.080
Let me think. What are some things I want to give an FU to?

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:23.700
My first FU goes to my erratic sleeping schedule because I was a half hour late to work on

01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:48.460
p0k3smot42o

01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:53.460
p0k3smot42o p0k3smot42o p0k3smot42o

01:31:18.460 --> 01:31:24.540
my stuff on the counter and it's like floating. I'm like, shit man. I have no idea. I'll keep

01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:31.540
track of that. Probably shaving. Actually, I have that problem with Dan. Cause after

01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:35.220
he gets out of the bathroom for some reason there's an inch of water on the floor. And

01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:40.660
an inch of water on the sink. And I have to grab toilet paper and wipe down the sink.

01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:45.300
That's why in my bathroom, even if I get a little bit lax with cleaning off the counter,

01:31:45.300 --> 01:32:01.300
kostjamrh It's probably from shaving, and I probably just don't notice it because I'm in such a hurry in the morning. But I will try to be more conscious of it in the future.

01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:22.300
kostjamrh I found out something. The girl who was the onee-san in Battle Royale. She's the voice actor for Asuka in Battle Royale.

01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:50.300
kostjamrh Wonderful, your useless tribute fact of the day.

01:32:50.300 --> 01:33:05.300
0 Do you have any FUs today?

01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:18.300
1. I was wearing a new shirt

01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:39.780
Just waiting to get on a ride and this lady starts smoking in front of me, right?

01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:43.360
And I'm sitting here thinking first of all, we are in an enclosed area

01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:48.780
which means you're not supposed to be soaking and I didn't say that I just kept to myself and then I told my

01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:55.100
My friends who were with me and said, you know, this is like really annoying and she turns around and like screams at me

01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:59.500
I don't give a fuck. I can smoke all the fuck. I want blah blah blah and

01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:05.260
I said, okay, that's great. I'll actually know she can't I know she can't because she's in an enclosed area

01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:12.260
And, um, and there's a security guard sitting next to me, and I told him, and he told her to put it out, and she wouldn't put it out.

01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:17.260
And then she decided to yell at me about my shirt, and saying, what, am I not attractive? And I looked at her, and I said, no.

01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:25.260
And she was all, your shirt's very offensive, and I said, your smoking's very offensive, and all your little running around bratty-ass kids are offensive.

01:34:25.260 --> 01:34:33.260
And your face is offensive! At that point in which, she decided to try to storm on me, and then the security guard scrapped her, and ejected her from the park.

01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:35.260
That is how you do it!

01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:37.260
And uh...

01:34:37.260 --> 01:34:46.260
No, and then I have to say fuck you to all the people at MarineWorld who can't obviously run a fucking ride right.

01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:50.260
Every time something comes in, oh we're out of technical difficulty so you're going to have to wait for another 45 minutes.

01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:52.260
They're not drunk, they're just cardies.

01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:54.260
They need like pot-smoking cardies.

01:34:54.260 --> 01:34:56.260
And once you like do crank and-

01:34:56.260 --> 01:34:58.260
Cardies will make the ride work even if it needs duct tape.

01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:01.260
Do cardies make a ride work if it doesn't work?

01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:05.900
they don't care they'll put you on it but so yeah i ended up spending like two hours in this one

01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:10.700
line waiting for a stupid ride and i was like two cars just waiting to go and i ended up standing

01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:15.340
there just because i didn't really want to walk and wait in another one um but still fuck you

01:35:15.340 --> 01:35:20.220
then for being assholes when you ask them what's wrong you're like i don't know i just pushed the

01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:27.660
buttons stupid bastards and then um fuck you to the people what the hell nevermind anyways fuck

01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:34.660
I'd like you to know the people who said that all of you up in Sacramento are all known to absolutely suck at DDR.

01:35:34.660 --> 01:35:40.660
We're the worst DDR players in the world, okay? Because other people say it, it's true.

01:35:40.660 --> 01:35:46.660
Well, I know. They decided to try to tell me this as I go down there and I'm messing around the 4th machine.

01:35:46.660 --> 01:35:48.660
Which works perfectly. That's the best place ever.

01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:53.660
Yeah, I mean, I'm thinking, what, March Madness? What, 3 or 4 of the top 16 were from Sacramento?

01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:55.660
We suck. We really, really suck.

01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:24.660
I know, bastard.

01:36:24.660 --> 01:36:25.660
I didn't know.

01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:29.300
Well, let's have a dance off, and I'm like, what.

01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:32.040
First off, first off, first off.

01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:33.660
Anyone that calls it a dance off.

01:36:33.660 --> 01:36:34.660
I know.

01:36:34.660 --> 01:36:37.940
Okay, you should've known right there that, well, yeah.

01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:38.940
And I'm gonna say-

01:36:38.940 --> 01:36:40.940
I need not say no more.

01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:42.660
The kid was pretty good, I guess.

01:36:42.660 --> 01:36:47.760
I mean, he did play really well, but I mean for them to sit there and just get done telling

01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:51.020
me how much I suck and then wanna challenge me.

01:36:51.020 --> 01:36:52.280
Because of where you're from.

01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:53.280
Yeah.

01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:55.280
I've never seen you play, just because of where you're from.

01:36:55.280 --> 01:37:03.280
And not to mention, their extreme sucked at that point, because the unlocks were up to sync, and that was it, so none of the really good songs had been unlocked.

01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:11.280
And then, um, so they said, alright, we do best two out of three games, and blah blah blah, I'm like, fine, alright.

01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:19.280
So, we did the first two rounds, the first two games were PA, and surprisingly I beat them, because I never thought I was that good at PA.

01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:25.280
And I beat him by a pretty big margin, and then the second round we just went for, I guess, the overall score of all three songs.

01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:34.280
And, um, huh? Basically, yeah. But, I mean, there was some stupid little thing they said, and I said, alright, fine.

01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:40.280
And then I beat them, and then they were all pissed off because I won, and, you know, I'm from Sacramento.

01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:44.280
And then I came back later, because the guy was going to put in the unlock code, and he did.

01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:47.040
Legend of Max is there, and I just wanted to play it.

01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:50.040
And then, of course, you know, the happy little winners are there again.

01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:55.360
And now, can you beat Legend of Max? I said I'd beat it, like, maybe 2 out of 18, 20 tries.

01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:56.200
No.

01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:59.280
Okay, um, well, he can beat it all the time. Why don't you challenge him?

01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:03.640
I'm like, why would you, basically, why would you want to challenge me if I'm so inferior to him?

01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:06.920
And I'll just do it. And I beat it, I think it was, like, with a C or a D.

01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:11.400
And he failed it miserably before the freeze, before, like, the first main freeze.

01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:18.400
kostjamrh And it was funny when they tried to do doubles, because there was a broom right there where they could have wiped off the machine.

01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:49.400
And so they didn't. And I watched all three of them try to play doubles and slide right off the side of the machine onto the fourth plus off of the extreme.

01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:57.400
Because they are just too stupid to clean up. And I got up there...neither of them have memory slots.

01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:02.400
But it is still a fourth plus though, which was nice because it was fun to play.

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:10.400
But it's just, you know, if you're going to come up and say people suck and you think they're so bad, don't challenge them to play because they might be better than you.

01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:15.400
namagem1 yes, this message has been brought to you by Zero

01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:20.400
namagem1 worth his information and kind words for all

01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:24.400
namagem1 and yeah so fuck them

01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:26.400
namagem1 fuck Marine World dude

01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:27.400
namagem1 that place is shitty

01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:29.400
namagem1 I wanna go back to Six Flags Magic Mountain where the roller coasters actually worked and it was fun

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:33.400
namagem1 so fuck Vallejo and shit like that and their stupid crap

01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:38.400
namagem1 I'm done because it sucks

01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:45.400
cpcgamer1- Let's talk to the chat room.

01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:48.400
cpcgamer1- Hello chat room.

01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:55.400
cpcgamer1- BlackLab would like to give FUs to fucking migraines. They always ruin things for me. I would have been at Rocky last night.

01:39:55.400 --> 01:40:05.400
cpcgamer1- Fuck Easy Mac. I'm sick of it already. There would be more but my roommate finally moved out and I have the room to myself for the next five weeks and that makes me happy.

01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:11.400
Stapler X would like to say F you to annoying bitches who can't stay quiet in a fucking screening room.

01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:17.400
And of course the president. No reason given, just F you.

01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:25.400
Darkdatsui would like to say fuck having to wait for E3 and the official footage of MGS3.

01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:32.400
Also he would like to give a suggestion that perhaps the game you were thinking about earlier, Jamie, stepping selection or stepping stage.

01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:28.800
p0k3smot42o

01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:29.800
kostjamrh

01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:30.800
kostjamrh

01:41:30.800 --> 01:41:48.800
0blivixx, i think

01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:59.800
0blivixx, yeah

01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:36.800
Snubdyspenoid would like to say a whole lot, here we go.

01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:03.400
hell is with all this Korean crap? Pump It Up, Ragnarok Online, who gives a crap? There's

01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:07.920
a bunch of other MMORPGs out there that are much better and much less repetitive and Pump

01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:08.920
It Up sex.

01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:09.920
Fuck you buddy.

01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:10.920
Would you like to respond to that, Jamie?

01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:13.440
Fuck you buddy. I like Ragnarok Online.

01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:14.440
Fuck you.

01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:17.320
I have more fun playing it and it's free.

01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:21.320
There you go. Free is a good thing.

01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:24.240
And my thief is level 26.

01:43:24.240 --> 01:43:25.240
I still like that. Fuck you.

01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:30.240
kostjamrh And it makes me think of Secret of Mana, so I like it, and all my friends wrote it.

01:43:55.240 --> 01:43:59.100
experiences with Fries, you think that the employees being paid commission would stop

01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:04.480
them from being shit-nosed, asshole-sucking, dirty-ass cock-dobblers?

01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:08.840
Okay, you know, Fries really does suck, but they actually did something good for me the

01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:14.680
other day. And this is like, well, no, they didn't even have any! They were sold out!

01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:21.140
No. They actually did a good, they actually did a good job, and actually, you know, sold

01:44:21.140 --> 01:44:26.140
kostjamrh And then at the end of that rant, he said, oh, free.

01:44:56.140 --> 01:44:59.540
You don't know me. You don't know my life. You don't know...

01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:03.540
And who think they know what I'm thinking? You're not psychic, bitches. Go see Miss Cleo.

01:45:03.540 --> 01:45:08.740
And finally, F you to not being able to go to Scandia for lack of money. My skills are slipping, dammit.

01:45:08.740 --> 01:45:09.940
Here's the part where you go,

01:45:09.940 --> 01:45:11.180
WHAT SKILLS?

01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:13.740
AHHH! AHHH!

01:45:13.740 --> 01:45:20.580
I'm so mean. You mean his total elite freestyling skills? Must keep passing eights, rar. Okay, out.

01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:21.900
Okay.

01:45:21.900 --> 01:45:23.860
Rock on.

01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:25.400
uh... next

01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:27.420
code zero

01:45:27.420 --> 01:45:30.340
would like to ask you to annoying people in the movie theater who must

01:45:30.340 --> 01:45:33.660
blurt out the name of every unit next to even though they are wrong eighty

01:45:33.660 --> 01:45:35.180
percent of the time all

01:45:35.180 --> 01:45:36.420
that reminds me

01:45:36.420 --> 01:45:40.500
all all all occur occur occur

01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:41.380
at you

01:45:41.380 --> 01:45:45.100
to that little kid who is sitting behind us next to act like this whole family

01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:47.760
they didn't even speak english they spoke russian or something

01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:49.400
and like there were three kids

01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:52.540
and they would like to shake the seat and stuff and we are just like her own

01:45:52.540 --> 01:45:57.420
stare and be all, what the hell do you think you're doing? They're stupid. They were really

01:45:57.420 --> 01:46:04.180
stupid because they had no idea why I was mad. I hate kids. There should be a law against

01:46:04.180 --> 01:46:10.160
bringing certain age children into a movie theater. I don't realize there are somewhat

01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:12.940
laws in R and X, but that should be punishable by death.

01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:16.660
I don't remember what theater I was at, but there was this kid there who was doing that

01:46:16.660 --> 01:46:22.260
to me and her parent was very nice to them. I turned around and I told the mom or something

01:46:22.260 --> 01:46:27.260
that if she didn't control her child, I'd report her to child services.

01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:28.260
To child protection services.

01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:29.260
And she was like, what?

01:46:29.260 --> 01:46:32.620
I was like, yeah, because it's going to be for neglect because I'm going to take her

01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:37.060
child and ship them off to some third world country of slavery.

01:46:37.060 --> 01:46:41.060
And she just looked at me and her child never did it again.

01:46:41.060 --> 01:46:44.860
I just, God, I hate kids, and we need to, you know what I should do?

01:46:44.860 --> 01:46:47.420
I should open up a movie theater where children are banned.

01:46:47.420 --> 01:46:50.740
I'd be the richest fucking man on the planet.

01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:54.740
Our Dave and Busters creation will also have a movie theater in it.

01:46:54.740 --> 01:46:55.740
Yes.

01:46:55.740 --> 01:46:59.740
Yes, we need to, I swear to God, Loki, we need to get alone and make this.

01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:03.740
We need to make our Dave and Busters slash movie theater slash children free world.

01:47:03.740 --> 01:47:05.740
It would be beautiful.

01:47:05.740 --> 01:47:08.740
I would cry tears of joy.

01:47:08.740 --> 01:47:10.740
Poor new land.

01:47:10.740 --> 01:47:12.740
Oh yeah.

01:47:12.740 --> 01:47:14.740
You know what else you need in there?

01:47:14.740 --> 01:47:16.740
You need the Discovery Zone in there with no children.

01:47:16.740 --> 01:47:19.740
All those nets and balls and things.

01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:23.740
I used to take my brothers there just so that I could go play.

01:47:23.740 --> 01:47:25.740
Alright, one more F you from the chat room.

01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:28.740
I used to take naps in there.

01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:34.740
Rice, ryc3 would like to say fuck you to my computer for buffering too much.

01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:38.740
It means you got to get broadband or if you are on broadband you need to get better broadband I guess.

01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:40.740
More memory.

01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:43.740
That's it. That there completes the F you's of the week.

01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:45.740
Yay.

01:47:45.740 --> 01:47:47.740
I'm so going to go on air.

01:47:47.740 --> 01:47:54.740
dukeofthebump

01:48:17.740 --> 01:48:23.660
So, let us do the cage match.

01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:25.860
That will be fun.

01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:30.380
That will be more fun than a barrel of monkeys.

01:48:30.380 --> 01:48:32.460
Did you find your cage match song, Loki?

01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:33.460
Yeah.

01:48:33.460 --> 01:48:34.460
Good.

01:48:34.460 --> 01:48:37.500
Alright, let's go into the orange lounge cage match.

01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:44.820
Last week on the orange lounge cage match, a real shocker, I don't know how this song

01:48:44.820 --> 01:48:45.820
won, but it did.

01:48:45.820 --> 01:48:50.820
vinuvinumusic

01:49:15.820 --> 01:49:20.500

01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:24.260

01:49:54.260 --> 01:50:12.260
I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do

01:50:12.260 --> 01:50:19.260
I don't know what to do

01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:20.260
Hi!

01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:21.260
Hi!

01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:22.260
Hi!

01:50:22.260 --> 01:50:23.260
Hi!

01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:24.260
Hi!

01:51:24.260 --> 01:51:31.260
when it started rhyming I'd float to the fence

01:51:31.260 --> 01:51:34.260
I could get laid back on your neck patty back

01:51:34.260 --> 01:51:36.260
give the dog a bite and now some candy and a back

01:51:36.260 --> 01:51:38.260
roll him over roll him over bake him in the pan

01:51:38.260 --> 01:51:40.260
I'm the little girl that makes the gingerbread man

01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:43.260
understand how big his dickie done you understood

01:51:43.260 --> 01:51:45.260
and you can thank me for sure Mike hot at the jam

01:51:45.260 --> 01:51:47.260
Chris hot at the shop, Lauren hot at the shop

01:51:47.260 --> 01:51:49.260
and Bo got his chick so my piano swing

01:51:49.260 --> 01:51:52.660
Prince hollers just drawn outta duck and bowl got his kick

01:51:52.660 --> 01:51:54.160
So I see how they swing

01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:55.660
This is what girls are made of

01:51:55.660 --> 01:51:57.860
Sugar and spice and I'm born to slice

01:51:57.860 --> 01:52:00.160
I got no rhymes because we got show

01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:02.860
I got no nose because we got no eyes

01:52:02.860 --> 01:52:05.260
But for the women I was like a sock on my back

01:52:05.260 --> 01:52:08.060
I brought a judge in my hands and my pants were slag

01:52:08.060 --> 01:52:36.260
All right, our mics were off during that whole little pass thing.

01:52:36.260 --> 01:52:42.820
Why is the cage match music playing when no one is talking.

01:52:42.820 --> 01:52:46.900
She is on the I love the 80's show every once-in-a- while on VH1.

01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:50.380
Again, that was last week's winner that you just heard a little clip of, Raven Simone.

01:52:50.380 --> 01:52:52.240
We were doing Chris Cross over it in the background.

01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:55.240
She was the youngest girl on the Cosby Show with Thats What Little Girls Are Made Of.

01:52:55.240 --> 01:52:57.340
Thats the first song you can vote for in tonight's cage match.

01:52:57.340 --> 01:53:01.180
That was Raven Simone and Thats What Little Girls Are Made Of.

01:53:01.180 --> 01:53:02.180
All right.

01:53:02.180 --> 01:53:05.500
I wasn't here to rate it, so I gave it 3.

01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:34.500
Jamee, when are you going to have time to do more work on the Battle Royale roleplay?

01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:37.500
Um, who's that from?

01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:39.500
Uh, puppy.

01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:44.500
Puppy? Um, puppy. Um, we'll work on it Tuesday night if I'm not out.

01:53:44.500 --> 01:53:45.500
Okay.

01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:47.500
But I'm not gonna be up late because I'm working now.

01:53:47.500 --> 01:53:50.500
Okay. Okay, into the cage match. Back to the cage match.

01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:53.500
Loki, what track on the CD do we want here?

01:53:55.500 --> 01:53:58.500
Oh, son of a bitch. It's not showing me the...

01:53:58.500 --> 01:53:59.500
Sure.

01:53:59.500 --> 01:54:00.500
I know.

01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:02.500
It's a, it's a, um, um...

01:54:02.500 --> 01:54:23.500
What's your pick this week?

01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:38.740
which is in four days. Matrix Reloaded is part of the score. It's actually really awesome.

01:54:38.740 --> 01:54:43.700
It's the scene that they're going to be having that kick-ass awesome car chase scene. This

01:54:43.700 --> 01:54:49.740
is also named after a book that came out a while back. It's called Mona Lisa Overdrive.

01:54:49.740 --> 01:54:55.180
It's Juno Reactor and Don Davis. Now, are we really playing the whole ten minutes of

01:54:55.180 --> 01:55:00.180
this? We can play like five to eight minutes. Okay, we're going to play a portion of this

01:55:00.180 --> 01:55:13.180
The edit of it is on my computer, but my sound card sucks ass, so yeah. But because there's an edit of it, that's because I'm doing it for tourneymix 4, so look for that.

01:55:13.180 --> 01:55:20.180
it for Tourney Mix 4, so look for that.

02:02:43.180 --> 02:02:52.180
If it does win, there's going to be an edit put in rotation that's even shorter. It just pretty much has the techno parts of it.

02:02:52.180 --> 02:02:57.180
But it's cool. The edit's really cool. Hopefully we can play the edit for you at the end of the show. We're just having some problems with Logan's computer right now.

02:02:57.180 --> 02:03:02.180
Anyway, let's go around the room and see what people thought, starting with Jenny, because she has the mic.

02:03:02.180 --> 02:03:17.180
It definitely sounded like something that's supposed to go behind something. It wouldn't be something that I would want to listen to over and over and over again, but it didn't suck. It's just not something that I would listen to a lot of, so I'd give it an 8.

02:03:18.180 --> 02:03:19.180
Brad?

02:03:20.180 --> 02:03:21.180
Yeah, Brad and Irene are here.

02:03:22.180 --> 02:03:23.180
Oh, hi Brad and Irene, who got here, by the way.

02:03:23.180 --> 02:03:36.180
I think it was a good song. I kind of agree. It's a soundtrack song. I can't wait to see the movie. I'm sure it's going to kick ass there. But it's a good song. I give it a 9.

02:03:36.180 --> 02:03:39.180
Irene, the rights princess.

02:03:39.180 --> 02:03:50.180
I have a short attention span and it was a long song. It doesn't mean it was bad. It's just hard for me to concentrate on it. Yeah, I know. It's like a freaking long song.

02:03:50.180 --> 02:03:57.180
But, um, it was a good song, like, I mean, for a soundtrack song, I mean, it was good, so I'd give it an 8.

02:03:57.180 --> 02:03:58.180
Mmkay.

02:03:58.180 --> 02:04:00.180
Zero!

02:04:00.180 --> 02:04:05.180
Going by the fact that it's even on the movie, I would give it a 10, but I can't do that because I wouldn't be nice.

02:04:05.180 --> 02:04:10.180
No, actually, it definitely seems like something, yeah, that would be on a movie.

02:04:10.180 --> 02:04:15.180
It's not something that you'd hear anywhere else except the soundtrack or the movie, but I liked it a lot.

02:04:15.180 --> 02:04:20.180
And I actually downloaded it and I think I enjoyed it. I give it like a 9.

02:04:20.180 --> 02:04:22.180
Low-key is what we need to ask.

02:04:22.180 --> 02:04:28.180
It was fucking awesome, dude. I listened to that song, I kid you not, 60 times at least since I've gotten this soundtrack.

02:04:28.180 --> 02:04:33.180
And that was only a couple days ago. And it's awesome driving music. Perfect for driving.

02:04:33.180 --> 02:04:35.180
You just get going and it's like, yeah!

02:04:35.180 --> 02:04:37.180
Your own track real fast.

02:04:37.180 --> 02:04:44.180
No, but it's really awesome. I wish you guys could listen to the whole thing because it does pick up even more afterwards and gets really cool techno-y stuff.

02:04:44.180 --> 02:04:50.180
But like I said before, it is going to be my pick for Turning Mix 4, and you're going to have a pretty good cut of it then.

02:04:50.180 --> 02:04:56.180
But since, you know, it's two minutes and a half, two and a half minutes, it kind of loses some of the stuff, but yeah, really cool. I love it.

02:04:56.180 --> 02:04:59.180
Ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten.

02:04:59.180 --> 02:05:06.180
I really do agree with the sentiment that Jamie kind of started about how it's a soundtrack song, it's kind of in the background.

02:05:06.180 --> 02:05:13.180
But I have an unfair advantage. I've heard that edit that Loki's done, the two and a half minute edit, and he really has taken all the best parts of the song

02:05:13.180 --> 02:05:17.740
song and made it a stand-alone song like he took all the dude like kind of it

02:05:17.740 --> 02:05:21.620
kind of sounds a little tackish actually to me to me I did kind of think that but

02:05:21.620 --> 02:05:25.900
yeah back to the soundtrack thing right actually there's another song and they're

02:05:25.900 --> 02:05:31.300
called just Chateau that does sound like gravity would that be cool if they

02:05:31.300 --> 02:05:34.900
detected the center that'll be it let's do it that is a topic of discussion when

02:05:34.900 --> 02:05:38.340
we come back the money artists we want to see do movie scores but anyway um I

02:05:38.340 --> 02:05:48.340
I think it's a good song. I think the edit's really, really good and that if that goes into rotation it'll be fine, so I give it a 9. It's a good song, it really is.

02:05:48.340 --> 02:05:57.340
But yeah, if I heard all that kind of symphonic stuff during the dance, our normal, the money means more for them, I'd probably go to sleep.

02:05:57.340 --> 02:06:02.340
Well, I think it should be mentioned that I was going to do a remix with that being part of the remix.

02:06:02.340 --> 02:06:08.340
That was supposed to be entered into the remixing contest, which the deadline is tomorrow, but I don't think that's going to happen.

02:06:08.340 --> 02:06:13.340
But I was planning on doing a remix of it.

02:06:13.340 --> 02:06:16.340
Alright, let's get into Jamie's pick. Jamie, what did you bring to the table tonight?

02:06:16.340 --> 02:06:22.340
Mine's old. I couldn't think of anything else again, so I just picked Herbie Hancock Rocket.

02:06:22.340 --> 02:06:24.340
And this is from a game, isn't it?

02:06:24.340 --> 02:06:27.180
Well, they did different versions of Amplitude.

02:06:27.180 --> 02:06:30.340
Okay, but this is a cool song, so here's your last pick for tonight.

02:06:30.340 --> 02:06:37.340
This is Herbie Hancock with Rocket.

02:08:30.340 --> 02:08:37.340
Fuck you.

02:08:37.340 --> 02:08:44.340
Fuck you.

02:08:44.340 --> 02:08:51.340
Fuck you.

02:08:51.340 --> 02:08:58.340
Fuck you.

02:09:58.340 --> 02:10:05.340
Uh huh.

02:10:05.340 --> 02:10:12.340
Uh huh.

02:10:12.340 --> 02:10:19.340
Uh huh.

02:10:19.340 --> 02:10:26.340
Uh huh.

02:11:56.340 --> 02:12:09.900
Alrighty, that was Herbie Hancock with Rocket.

02:12:09.900 --> 02:12:12.180
Hope you all enjoyed that one.

02:12:12.180 --> 02:12:16.060
Let's go around and see what everyone else thought of Herbie Hancock, Rocket.

02:12:16.060 --> 02:12:17.620
Starting off with Jamie.

02:12:17.620 --> 02:12:18.620
Ten.

02:12:18.620 --> 02:12:21.460
You want to give any reasons why?

02:12:21.460 --> 02:12:22.460
Ten.

02:12:22.460 --> 02:12:23.460
Alright.

02:12:23.460 --> 02:12:27.460
I'll take that as a no. Irene, what do you think?

02:12:27.460 --> 02:12:30.460
I liked it a lot. I liked it a lot. 9.

02:12:30.460 --> 02:12:33.460
Alright. Loki.

02:12:33.460 --> 02:12:38.460
That was alright. Reminds me of Breakin', so give it 8.

02:12:38.460 --> 02:12:41.460
Zero, what did you think of Herbie Hancock Rocket?

02:12:41.460 --> 02:12:43.460
What don't I think of that song?

02:12:43.460 --> 02:12:53.460
No, actually, that is the second song of the 80s I remember, besides that super happy stalker song by The Police.

02:12:53.460 --> 02:12:58.460
But I give that song a 10, just because it's been a favorite of mine forever.

02:12:58.460 --> 02:13:00.460
Brad, do you have anything you want to say?

02:13:00.460 --> 02:13:02.460
10. Brad gives it a 10.

02:13:02.460 --> 02:13:04.460
Brad throws a 10 out through the door.

02:13:04.460 --> 02:13:16.460
I like that song, it's pretty cool. If they ever did like a 2DX classic version or something and like brought back a bunch of old 80's songs, I would cry my eyes out if that was not in it.

02:13:16.460 --> 02:13:26.460
I'm working on a file for the 2DX simulators for that song, and for DDR.

02:13:26.460 --> 02:13:28.460
So I give that like an eight and a half.

02:13:28.460 --> 02:13:29.460
Eight and a half?

02:13:29.460 --> 02:13:30.460
Eight and a half.

02:13:30.460 --> 02:13:31.460
Eight and a half.

02:13:31.460 --> 02:13:32.460
Eight and a half. Didn't you play it?

02:14:02.460 --> 02:14:03.460
It's hooked up now.

02:15:02.460 --> 02:15:06.460
tonight's cage match. It's a raving, moaning cock.

02:15:06.460 --> 02:15:10.460
No, it's a cock rocket.

02:15:10.460 --> 02:15:14.460
Only on Orange Lounge Radio do you get the

02:15:14.460 --> 02:15:18.460
raving, moaning cock rocket here on the cage match.

02:15:18.460 --> 02:15:22.460
Weee-haaa-boom.

02:15:22.460 --> 02:15:26.460
You know what's funny about Asian porn? What? It looks like Legos have execs.

02:15:26.460 --> 02:15:30.460
Why do you say that? You have to explain that for those who may not have seen Asian porn.

02:15:30.460 --> 02:15:37.460
It's all blocked out and stuff, because they're Japanese laws, like no private parts can be shown.

02:15:37.460 --> 02:15:40.460
So it just looks like a bunch of Legos having sex.

02:15:40.460 --> 02:15:44.460
Based on the American invasion of the Aztec.

02:15:47.460 --> 02:15:51.460
It's Aztec sex, baby. Oh yeah. Go mosaic.

02:15:51.460 --> 02:15:54.460
The law is actually passed because I'm American.

02:15:54.460 --> 02:15:58.460
It's because we have Asian fever.

02:15:58.460 --> 02:16:03.800
fever. We want that Asian punani. And we have to import it like nuts. And the Japanese are

02:16:03.800 --> 02:16:09.640
getting jealous because, you know, the Japanese men stand a chance against us American men.

02:16:09.640 --> 02:16:16.600
And so, they don't want us taking their women away from them. And so, despite us, they censor

02:16:16.600 --> 02:16:17.600
their porn.

02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:21.600
Oh, we're doing this one way.

02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:24.600
Um, great, dead airspace here.

02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:29.600
Sorry, I'm starting to tally up some of the votes here, so...

02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:32.600
No, you guys missed the philosophical message of the day.

02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:34.600
Uh-oh, what was that?

02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:38.600
Life is a sexually transmitted fatal disease that's also hereditary.

02:16:38.600 --> 02:16:43.600
After your mom gave blowjobs at a truck stop.

02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:46.600
I said after your mom gave blowjobs at a truck stop.

02:16:46.600 --> 02:16:51.600
He downloaded the mall blowjobs.

02:16:51.600 --> 02:16:53.600
No, no, no.

02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:56.600
It was like street blowjobs.

02:16:56.600 --> 02:17:03.600
It's this guy with this camera and his glasses and he convinces some girl to give him a blowjob, supposedly.

02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:05.600
Yeah, also.

02:17:05.600 --> 02:17:07.600
I...well...shh!

02:17:07.600 --> 02:17:09.600
You lie!

02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:11.600
Your scene's all set. Next thing you're probably going to be seeing is,

02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:18.600
The amazing flying microphone.

02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:20.600
Bad catch.

02:17:20.600 --> 02:17:25.600
No, wrestling is not fake. It's real. Real fake.

02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:28.600
You funny.

02:17:28.600 --> 02:17:33.600
Looks like Jamie's going to go off the turnbuckle with the elbow there.

02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:36.600
She's slapping her elbow.

02:17:36.600 --> 02:17:41.600
Alright, last call for votes in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match. In the meantime, let's take a quick break.

02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:42.600
Vote, bitches.

02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:44.600
What do we want to do when we come back from the break?

02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:45.600
Polka.

02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:46.600
Polka?

02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:52.600
Oh, yeah, yeah, we're going to do that topic about Bemani artists and soundtracks and movies they should have done.

02:17:52.600 --> 02:17:56.600
Nah, it's too weird to be a listless, but we could do a listless.

02:17:56.600 --> 02:17:59.600
But then again, I'm too lazy to get paper, so we'll just talk.

02:17:59.600 --> 02:18:01.600
Oh, never mind.

02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:02.600
Never mind.

02:18:02.600 --> 02:18:04.600
Alright, fine.

02:18:04.600 --> 02:18:05.600
Fine.

02:18:05.600 --> 02:18:07.600
Okay, last call for Cage Match, folks.

02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:09.600
That was lunch.

02:18:09.600 --> 02:18:11.600
I'll play it later.

02:18:11.600 --> 02:18:17.600
Alright, we'll be back after this quick break featuring, um...

02:18:17.600 --> 02:18:21.600
Oh, I don't know. What kind of song should I play here?

02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:22.600
Cal Snyder Remixed by...

02:18:22.600 --> 02:18:25.600
Oh, let's do something. I should do something from EX3.

02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:30.600
Dance Mania EX3 was out a couple weeks ago and I got a copy of it. Thank you.

02:18:30.600 --> 02:18:34.600
And we'll play...

02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:49.600
I'm a little yellow fish in the deep blue sea Won't somebody help me?

02:18:49.600 --> 02:19:02.600
I'm a little yellow fish in the deep blue sea Won't somebody help me?

02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:18.160
Do you wanna know how livin' this in me's the way?

02:19:18.160 --> 02:19:25.160
Do you wanna know how everything I knew was changed?

02:19:25.160 --> 02:19:32.160
It was just like a big commotion I just had a couple magic oceans

02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:35.160
The regal was with, slightly damaged

02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:38.660
I was a fish, help me

02:19:38.660 --> 02:19:42.660
I'm a little yellow fish in the deep blue sea

02:19:42.660 --> 02:19:45.660
Won't somebody help me

02:19:45.660 --> 02:19:50.160
I'm a little yellow fish in the deep blue sea

02:19:50.160 --> 02:19:53.160
Won't somebody save me

02:19:56.660 --> 02:19:59.160
Do you wanna take a whale pass

02:19:59.160 --> 02:20:04.160
Do you wanna meet a stupid shot?

02:20:04.160 --> 02:20:07.160
Do you wanna ride the steel or so high?

02:20:07.160 --> 02:20:11.160
Did it always survive?

02:20:11.160 --> 02:20:15.160
It isn't such a big commotion

02:20:15.160 --> 02:20:18.160
All you need is magic motion

02:20:18.160 --> 02:20:20.160
And with a wriggle and twist

02:20:20.160 --> 02:20:22.160
It's such a big fish

02:20:22.160 --> 02:20:23.160
You're a fish!

02:20:23.160 --> 02:20:25.160
Help me!

02:20:25.160 --> 02:20:29.460
I'm a little yellow fish in the deep blue sea

02:20:29.460 --> 02:20:40.560
Won't somebody help me?

02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:53.560
Help me, help me, I need a remedy

02:20:53.560 --> 02:20:57.560
When the strings of the night are in your sight

02:20:57.560 --> 02:21:00.560
You won't believe the things you see

02:21:00.560 --> 02:21:04.560
This world's only way to last time

02:21:04.560 --> 02:21:07.560
If you don't wanna feel like it

02:21:07.560 --> 02:21:11.560
I'm a little yellow fish in the deep blue sea

02:21:11.560 --> 02:21:14.560
Won't somebody help me?

02:21:14.560 --> 02:21:18.560
I'm a little yellow fish in the deep blue sea

02:21:18.560 --> 02:21:22.560
Won't somebody, somebody help me?

02:21:22.560 --> 02:21:26.060
Little Little Fish in the deep blue sea

02:21:26.060 --> 02:21:29.060
Somebody save me

02:21:29.060 --> 02:21:33.560
I'm Little Little Fish in the deep blue sea

02:21:33.560 --> 02:21:36.560
Won't somebody save me?

02:21:36.560 --> 02:21:38.560
Save me!

02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:46.060
1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 7

02:21:46.060 --> 02:21:49.560
All the rest can go away

02:21:49.560 --> 02:22:05.560
So little time, so many months, yet it never seems enough.

02:22:05.560 --> 02:22:12.560
So many people passing by me and so few are made out of the right stuff.

02:22:12.560 --> 02:22:18.560
There seems to be a shortage of heroes.

02:22:18.560 --> 02:22:24.560
There ain't enough ones or too many zeros

02:22:24.560 --> 02:22:28.560
One, two, three, four, oh, oh, seven

02:22:28.560 --> 02:22:32.560
All the good guys go to heaven

02:22:32.560 --> 02:22:34.560
Five, six, seven, eight

02:22:34.560 --> 02:22:35.560
Hey, hey!

02:22:35.560 --> 02:22:38.560
All the rest of them go away

02:22:38.560 --> 02:22:42.560
One, two, three, four, oh, oh, seven

02:22:42.560 --> 02:22:45.560
All the good guys go to heaven

02:22:45.560 --> 02:23:10.880
One, two, three, four, oh, oh, seven.

02:23:10.880 --> 02:23:13.920
Before that, help I'm a fish by Creamy and really fast, we're still in the middle of

02:23:13.920 --> 02:23:22.080
a break here but Irene would you share your bean burrito theory I came up with

02:23:22.080 --> 02:23:26.320
the bean burrito theory a couple years ago when I heard that song the one two

02:23:26.320 --> 02:23:33.240
three four oh seven because artists some artists on DDR they just pull random

02:23:33.240 --> 02:23:39.000
themes or just random words and put them together in a song and it just sounds

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:42.880
stupid like you know and the reason I came up with bean burrito is just like

02:23:42.880 --> 02:23:49.420
Oh, you know, hey, I'm hungry. Oh bean burrito. La la la. It's just like it's stupid. Yeah bean

02:23:51.520 --> 02:23:58.720
Moly sour cream and extra cheese. I haven't thought up any other let's get that GDR

02:24:00.520 --> 02:24:02.960
It's the Mexican version he's seeing that one more time

02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:06.080
bean burrito

02:24:06.080 --> 02:24:10.920
guacamole, sour cream, and extra cheese.

02:24:10.920 --> 02:24:12.960
I'm going to punch you.

02:24:12.960 --> 02:24:15.400
Rob, you're a dork.

02:24:15.400 --> 02:24:18.080
I just want an extra clean copy of that for any remixes we

02:24:18.080 --> 02:24:18.600
might plan.

02:24:18.600 --> 02:24:19.120
Thank you.

02:24:19.120 --> 02:24:20.200
Oh, you're welcome.

02:24:20.200 --> 02:24:23.160
OK, well, let's look at Crash here.

02:24:23.160 --> 02:24:24.400
I'm going to go my way.

02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:26.320
Come with me, you mothers.

02:24:26.320 --> 02:24:28.280
Let's go.

02:24:28.280 --> 02:24:30.720
One, two, three, four, five.

02:24:30.720 --> 02:24:32.120
Break the doll and get out of here.

02:24:32.120 --> 02:24:33.000
Come with me now.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:34.720
Now we're all going our way.

02:24:34.720 --> 02:24:35.520
Makes no sense.

02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:42.160
I want to show you baby the world that you've never seen because it can happen now, so hold

02:24:42.160 --> 02:24:43.560
you tight babe.

02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:45.240
Just pick any Eurobeat song.

02:24:45.240 --> 02:24:46.800
Let's see here.

02:24:46.800 --> 02:24:51.040
Any Eurobeat song.

02:24:51.040 --> 02:24:55.960
I don't want to know what they say, no, no, I don't care, they can tell me nothing, I'm

02:24:55.960 --> 02:24:56.960
going to go my way.

02:24:56.960 --> 02:25:01.600
Wait, you're not doing it right, it's I don't want to know, it's like Mr. Spanky singing.

02:25:01.600 --> 02:25:07.600
Well, you know, I don't want my voice being made into some sort of DWI, so obviously I'm not going to do it with any rhythm.

02:25:07.600 --> 02:25:09.600
We really don't need to hear it all, Matt.

02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:12.600
Hey, we're still in break time!

02:25:12.600 --> 02:25:15.600
Come on, go on, and fall apart. Let's go. Ah.

02:25:15.600 --> 02:25:16.600
Ah!

02:25:16.600 --> 02:25:24.600
Ah, alright. Back to break. I'm going to play this. This is something that Justin's working on. It's a world premiere. It's an original piece.

02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:27.600
And he's even calling himself different names now, too. This is pretty funny.

02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:28.600
This is pretty funny.

02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:30.160
He's calling himself Hyper Orchestra.

02:25:30.160 --> 02:25:34.080
So this is Hyper Orchestra with Musette in D. This is a little sample.

02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:35.880
It's a work in progress.

02:25:35.880 --> 02:25:39.480
And then after that, we're going to hear a request that Jamie wants you all to hear.

02:25:39.480 --> 02:25:41.480
So, we shall do that.

02:26:09.480 --> 02:26:11.480
Oh

02:26:39.480 --> 02:26:43.480
You're gonna see me die

02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:51.480
Drowning in the dark

02:26:54.480 --> 02:26:57.480
Where were you to hold my hand

02:26:57.480 --> 02:27:00.480
To the things that we had planned

02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:03.480
Yes, I need you by my side

02:27:03.480 --> 02:27:05.480
When things go crazy

02:27:05.480 --> 02:27:08.480
I just need to know you here

02:27:08.480 --> 02:27:11.360
Can't we see that you'll see this

02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:14.160
When I wake up in the night

02:27:14.160 --> 02:27:16.960
Will you be my guiding light

02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:21.600
I don't care how far I'll take a place tonight

02:27:22.560 --> 02:27:27.120
Tell me where you are and everything's gonna be alright

02:27:27.120 --> 02:27:29.520
Like a shooting star

02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:32.720
Running in the sky

02:27:32.720 --> 02:27:38.220
Wanna fly, just to be with you tonight

02:27:38.220 --> 02:27:43.720
I can shoot it down, across the midnight sky

02:27:43.720 --> 02:27:50.720
Want to fly, just to be with you tonight.

02:28:13.720 --> 02:28:20.720
A and the number 59.

02:28:43.720 --> 02:28:44.720
I'm sorry, Zero?

02:28:44.720 --> 02:28:45.720
Huh?

02:28:45.720 --> 02:28:46.720
I didn't say anything.

02:28:46.720 --> 02:28:47.720
I thought you said anyone.

02:28:47.720 --> 02:28:48.720
I just said death.

02:28:48.720 --> 02:28:49.720
But anyway.

02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:50.720
What's death?

02:28:50.720 --> 02:28:51.720
Burritos.

02:28:51.720 --> 02:28:52.720
Chicken.

02:28:52.720 --> 02:29:02.160
Okay, so while they play nachos, vinyl over there, the winner of tonight's cage match,

02:29:02.160 --> 02:29:03.880
by the way, can we get a big drumroll?

02:29:03.880 --> 02:29:06.040
I'm gonna use this next week.

02:29:06.040 --> 02:29:10.320
Okay, the winner is Mona Lisa Overdrive won the cage match.

02:29:10.320 --> 02:29:11.320
Yay.

02:29:11.320 --> 02:29:12.320
Of course.

02:29:12.320 --> 02:29:18.240
can use that next week, Jamie. But, this is the first week I can remember in a long, long

02:29:18.240 --> 02:29:23.680
time where every song did get at least one vote. Usually my picks don't even get a vote,

02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:29.240
but tonight every song at least got one vote. It's Raven Symone. Everyone's a winner. At

02:29:29.240 --> 02:29:35.120
least two votes, no. Everybody loves a seven year old. Raven Symone was not lucky enough

02:29:35.120 --> 02:29:38.920
I have to get two votes tonight.

02:29:38.920 --> 02:29:41.520
Stop putting on Raven Simone, she sucks.

02:29:41.520 --> 02:29:42.520
Sucks!

02:29:42.520 --> 02:29:44.360
I didn't vote her as the winner last week.

02:29:44.360 --> 02:29:47.720
You guys voted her as the winner?

02:29:47.720 --> 02:29:49.720
I'm dismayed.

02:29:49.720 --> 02:29:51.680
Our listeners suck.

02:29:51.680 --> 02:29:53.260
Why are you dismayed?

02:29:53.260 --> 02:29:54.920
Because Rocket owns you.

02:29:54.920 --> 02:29:55.920
Because what?

02:29:55.920 --> 02:29:56.920
Rocket owns.

02:29:56.920 --> 02:29:59.920
Rocket does own, and it did get a good reaction, but unfortunately you just got beat by the

02:29:59.920 --> 02:30:01.200
Matrix like everything else.

02:30:01.200 --> 02:30:03.000
Who'd be on the Matrix?

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:10.000
I don't believe in the Matrix. Watch me bend this spoon with the power of my mind.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:15.000
I'll hack the world!

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:30.800
Anyway, more topics. Like promised earlier, we wanted to talk about movies that Bemani

02:30:30.800 --> 02:30:35.080
artists should do soundtracks too. Now this could be like upcoming sequels, or just like

02:30:35.080 --> 02:30:37.760
ideas for films, or movies in the past that would have been cooler with it.

02:30:37.760 --> 02:30:40.960
X-Men movie, TAC. X-Men movie with a TAC soundtrack?

02:30:40.960 --> 02:30:43.560
Matrix with TAC. Matrix with TAC?

02:30:43.560 --> 02:30:46.600
Babes in Toyland featuring TAC. Is there any movie you wouldn't want to see

02:30:46.600 --> 02:30:53.200
TAC doing in the soundtrack too? Um, Secchi movies.

02:30:53.200 --> 02:30:57.080
Yes, Loki. Uh oh.

02:30:57.080 --> 02:31:06.680
Glitter 2 featuring Paul Eteri That was cute, he did a little happy hop

02:31:06.680 --> 02:31:14.000
He did a little happy hopper I bought Orange Lounge, the band, doing a

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:18.880
soundtrack to a porno French porno

02:31:18.880 --> 02:31:25.880
to

02:31:26.680 --> 02:31:30.300
that would be funny and you know it

02:31:30.300 --> 02:31:34.080
yet i could see talk i do like a really epic kind of film

02:31:34.080 --> 02:31:38.140
talker do like an epic i was thinking like a summer kabadda

02:31:38.140 --> 02:31:42.440
that would be cool to do you know i feel like zero says a gothic porno

02:31:42.440 --> 02:31:44.840
kabadda doing rpg music

02:31:44.840 --> 02:31:54.840
Well, I don't know if anybody listening knows this for a fact, but since it is Konami, Metal Gear Solid, I don't know, maybe.

02:31:54.840 --> 02:32:01.840
But Red Nikita does remind me of Metal Gear Solid, kind of, so maybe that he actually had some actual production in the music of Metal Gear Solid in some way.

02:32:01.840 --> 02:32:11.840
One thing for my Metal Gear Solid CD that I have, there's the theme song remix by Quadra from the end.

02:32:11.840 --> 02:32:13.840
And you know Quadra did Five Key stuff?

02:32:41.840 --> 02:32:43.840
And yes, he is back in it.

02:32:43.840 --> 02:32:45.840
So they might as well see that.

02:32:45.840 --> 02:32:48.840
They might as well dig, of course, the Bane bad guy is supposed to be a kuna.

02:32:48.840 --> 02:32:50.840
Oh my god, oh my god, is Kylie Minogue going to be back in it?

02:32:50.840 --> 02:32:51.840
I would.

02:32:51.840 --> 02:32:52.840
That would be the best.

02:32:52.840 --> 02:32:53.840
She better be.

02:32:53.840 --> 02:32:54.840
That'll be the only reason.

02:32:54.840 --> 02:32:55.840
I know, she has a career now.

02:32:55.840 --> 02:32:57.840
I'm the Green Fairy.

02:32:57.840 --> 02:32:59.840
No.

02:32:59.840 --> 02:33:01.840
Break-In 3.

02:33:01.840 --> 02:33:03.840
Featuring Good Cool.

02:33:03.840 --> 02:33:06.840
That would be awesome.

02:33:06.840 --> 02:33:08.840
What's this in the VCR right now?

02:33:08.840 --> 02:33:10.840
We're watching Break-In.

02:33:10.840 --> 02:33:14.840
The only break-in movie I'd ever seen was the sequel, Breakin' 2 Electric Googaloo.

02:33:14.840 --> 02:33:15.840
Is it Breakdancing?

02:33:15.840 --> 02:33:17.840
Breakdancing. It's done in 82, 83.

02:33:17.840 --> 02:33:20.840
Nice. I like that.

02:33:20.840 --> 02:33:21.840
I like that.

02:33:21.840 --> 02:33:25.840
Here's a cute joke. Here's a cute joke. This is from the chatroom.

02:33:25.840 --> 02:33:28.840
Terminator 2DX with Tran as Terminator.

02:33:28.840 --> 02:33:30.840
Yes, but if you've ever heard...

02:33:30.840 --> 02:33:32.840
Alien Tran for Tran.

02:33:32.840 --> 02:33:35.840
Have you ever seen the Terminator movie, guys?

02:33:35.840 --> 02:33:37.840
I mean the music is like

02:33:41.540 --> 02:33:43.380
It's just a bunch of weird sound effects

02:33:43.380 --> 02:33:49.100
It's like the guy pressed on his keyboard a couple times and said here. This is a soundtrack have you ever seen them?

02:33:49.260 --> 02:33:50.940
Have you ever seen the Mr.

02:33:50.940 --> 02:33:57.940
Science theater 3000 version of pod people where they're doing their new age music now put put your hand

02:33:58.060 --> 02:34:00.060
Okay, now put your finger on this key

02:34:00.940 --> 02:34:04.780
Now you're playing new age key. Okay now put two fingers on there now

02:34:04.780 --> 02:34:09.780
I remember playing a New Age chord. Now hold it down until you get a record label.

02:34:09.780 --> 02:34:12.780
And hold it down until you...

02:34:12.780 --> 02:34:14.780
It was hilarious.

02:34:14.780 --> 02:34:17.780
Back to the soundtracks idea. I'm thinking of like a scary movie.

02:34:17.780 --> 02:34:20.780
Let's say The Ring 2, because you know they're going to do a sequel to The Ring,

02:34:20.780 --> 02:34:22.780
based off one of the Japanese movies.

02:34:22.780 --> 02:34:26.780
Like, Ringu 2. How about Akira Yamaka doing the soundtrack?

02:34:26.780 --> 02:34:28.780
Dude, he did the soundtracks for Silent Hill.

02:34:28.780 --> 02:34:31.780
Some of the creepiest games ever.

02:34:31.780 --> 02:34:38.780
I went on a road trip once and my friend Garrett drove me out to these roads that are not lit very well, so it's like a scary place.

02:34:38.780 --> 02:34:43.780
There's all these trees and railroad tracks that are all abandoned and stuff.

02:34:43.780 --> 02:34:46.780
And we played Silent Hill while driving through there, it was scary.

02:34:46.780 --> 02:34:47.780
The music, the soundtrack?

02:34:47.780 --> 02:34:48.780
Yes.

02:34:48.780 --> 02:34:49.780
Oh my god.

02:34:49.780 --> 02:34:52.780
Because it really messed up. I've never really heard Silent Hill music before because I've never played the game.

02:34:52.780 --> 02:34:54.780
It kind of sounds like post-head, I think.

02:34:54.780 --> 02:34:58.780
I was really surprised. It doesn't sound like anything Kiriyama has done in 2DX.

02:34:58.780 --> 02:35:00.780
Nope, not really.

02:35:00.780 --> 02:35:04.780
The name of Silent Hill sounds like Sour Time.

02:35:04.780 --> 02:35:09.780
Yeah, the Portishead song, because it's got that guitar or ukulele or whatever they were doing.

02:35:22.780 --> 02:35:25.780
Hey, we love dead air here at Orange Lounge.

02:35:25.780 --> 02:35:27.780
Sorry, I've been reading private messages.

02:35:27.780 --> 02:35:31.780
There's a really funny one I'll have to share with you guys off air.

02:35:31.780 --> 02:35:36.780
Insect zero agent porn one.

02:35:36.780 --> 02:35:39.780
The boob...

02:35:39.780 --> 02:35:41.780
The misshapen boob chick killed the bug.

02:35:41.780 --> 02:35:44.780
Any other soundtrack ideas?

02:35:44.780 --> 02:35:49.780
Yeah, we can have True Kiss Destination doing...

02:35:49.780 --> 02:35:52.780
The Haul's World 2.

02:35:52.780 --> 02:35:55.780
What the hell?

02:35:55.780 --> 02:35:58.780
Um, yeah, I got it this time. I caught the mic.

02:35:58.780 --> 02:35:59.780
Argin has one.

02:35:59.780 --> 02:36:03.780
Deval doing Disney?

02:36:03.780 --> 02:36:05.780
Like, what Disney movie?

02:36:05.780 --> 02:36:07.780
I don't know.

02:36:07.780 --> 02:36:11.780
Deval doing Disney, like doing them.

02:36:11.780 --> 02:36:16.780
As the chat room suggested during Help I'm a Fish, that should be in Finding Nemo, the new movie coming out.

02:36:16.780 --> 02:36:19.780
You know what? No.

02:36:19.780 --> 02:36:24.780
Enemy Zero, featuring Desrow.

02:36:24.780 --> 02:36:27.780
that you made me watch, with the aliens?

02:36:27.780 --> 02:36:28.780
Oh, Wild Zero?

02:36:28.780 --> 02:36:29.780
Wild Zero, yeah.

02:36:29.780 --> 02:36:30.780
Featuring Desrow.

02:36:30.780 --> 02:36:32.780
Any trauma film featuring Desrow?

02:36:32.780 --> 02:36:33.780
No.

02:36:33.780 --> 02:36:34.780
How about who?

02:36:34.780 --> 02:36:36.780
No, I think Guitar Wolf.

02:36:36.780 --> 02:36:37.780
Orange Lounge?

02:36:37.780 --> 02:36:40.780
Guitar Wolf and Guitar Freaks.

02:36:40.780 --> 02:36:42.780
Guitar Wolf is awesome.

02:36:42.780 --> 02:36:45.780
Orange Lounge to do the soundtrack to the next John Waters movie.

02:36:45.780 --> 02:36:58.780
I think I killed the station.

02:36:58.780 --> 02:36:59.780
Well, let's see here.

02:36:59.780 --> 02:37:10.980
We could have the next American Pie movie with Mr. Brian in the final band.

02:37:10.980 --> 02:37:12.500
There is an American Pie movie coming out.

02:37:12.500 --> 02:37:13.500
American Wedding, I know.

02:37:13.500 --> 02:37:14.500
I know.

02:37:14.500 --> 02:37:15.500
The last one.

02:37:15.500 --> 02:37:16.500
Yeah.

02:37:16.500 --> 02:37:17.500
Yeah.

02:37:17.500 --> 02:37:28.260
I have a movie called 42K that you need to watch, it's hilarious, in parts.

02:37:28.260 --> 02:37:30.500
It's got punk music in it.

02:37:30.500 --> 02:37:39.180
Mr. No, it's funny, it has to do with these zombies attacking.

02:37:39.180 --> 02:37:43.060
They're like these zombies attacking this house and then they get these like Renta Ninjas

02:37:43.060 --> 02:37:44.740
they come over and then

02:37:44.740 --> 02:37:47.700
and there's like no there's these eight for alien chicks are

02:37:47.700 --> 02:37:48.660
it's wick

02:37:48.660 --> 02:37:51.660
let me find a tape is hilarious

02:37:51.660 --> 02:37:54.100
now robert you know when you tell me about

02:37:54.100 --> 02:37:58.620
they're actually doing a true sequel to write your picture show

02:37:58.620 --> 02:38:01.060
robin it's a rumor that comes up

02:38:01.060 --> 02:38:04.500
it's a rumor that comes up every now and then they did that one have the music by

02:38:04.500 --> 02:38:05.700
orange lounge

02:38:05.700 --> 02:38:06.820
that would be cool

02:38:06.820 --> 02:38:09.820
except you know the problem with that ritual brian has to do it yesterday he

02:38:09.820 --> 02:38:11.640
should so that he should bike

02:38:11.640 --> 02:38:12.960
contract orange lounge

02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:16.200
okay orange lounge can make a contribution

02:38:16.200 --> 02:38:19.720
but they're not all in french

02:38:19.720 --> 02:38:23.160
i think he gets uh... some help from rena gumo to do something like secret

02:38:23.160 --> 02:38:24.800
tale

02:38:24.800 --> 02:38:26.760
that's really bad i'm sorry

02:38:26.760 --> 02:38:30.960
but in all honesty i think led should do something in a music industry yes like uh...

02:38:30.960 --> 02:38:34.480
like a matrix type movie you know action because some of his really uh... you

02:38:34.480 --> 02:38:35.080
know

02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:36.840
like like uh...

02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:40.700
the outer limit outer limits that song something like that break beats

02:38:40.700 --> 02:38:45.700
Here's a question for you guys. Maybe this has been brought up on the show before, but I actually don't think it ever has, which is surprising.

02:38:45.700 --> 02:38:54.700
If a Bamani artist, any Bamani artist, were to release a CD here in the U.S., which one should do it, and why? Who would have the best chances of success?

02:38:54.700 --> 02:38:58.700
Well, Jamie says Tak, and she releases that.

02:38:58.700 --> 02:39:03.700
I mean, I only said that because she just said that. And, go ahead, Matt, Lucky.

02:39:03.700 --> 02:39:09.700
Well, obviously, it's got to be, I believe, isn't Last Message the good, cool featuring Meg?

02:39:09.700 --> 02:39:11.700
Well, then it'd have to be Meg, because she has a nice rack.

02:39:11.700 --> 02:39:15.700
One thing, actually, Fantastic Plastic Machine does have a CD in the US.

02:39:15.700 --> 02:39:16.700
I have it.

02:39:16.700 --> 02:39:23.700
Outside of ones that already do have one, and maybe like the one to, like outside of Dance Mania artists, let's say,

02:39:23.700 --> 02:39:27.700
because Dance Mania artists already have CDs, most of them, let's say, like, actual Baloney.

02:39:27.700 --> 02:39:29.700
Actual Baloney, you know, sounds sad.

02:39:29.700 --> 02:39:30.700
Konami, which Konami sounds sad.

02:39:30.700 --> 02:39:31.700
I guess, we could say.

02:39:31.700 --> 02:39:38.700
In all honesty, Jamie and Matt both say Good Cool.

02:39:38.700 --> 02:39:43.700
I agree, I think Good Cool would have the most chance of success.

02:39:43.700 --> 02:39:47.700
Actually though, it's funny you mention, I think one person that would have a really kickass CD, L.E.D.

02:39:47.700 --> 02:39:53.700
And I say that because he has so many different styles, like something like something wonderful,

02:39:53.700 --> 02:39:58.700
like kind of slow, kind of ballady epic type song, to like in your face, Strong Jaeger type music.

02:39:58.700 --> 02:39:59.700
I have something to say.

02:39:59.700 --> 02:40:00.700
Sure.

02:40:00.700 --> 02:40:10.140
The staple artists in the Konami Sound staff who are making music for Pumani games, Taka,

02:40:10.140 --> 02:40:16.980
Tak, L.E.D., Naoki, Good Cool, and I'm probably repeating names because they use the same

02:40:16.980 --> 02:40:17.980
names all the time.

02:40:17.980 --> 02:40:22.740
Anyway, they all have a chance releasing and selling good music because they all have good

02:40:22.740 --> 02:40:27.460
resumes as far as the music they've written, so it's really hard to choose which one.

02:40:27.460 --> 02:40:29.060
i mean if you're a local

02:40:29.060 --> 02:40:34.340
he's made music in games that are very popular america so

02:40:34.340 --> 02:40:39.340
for the same

02:40:39.340 --> 02:40:40.460
i don't know

02:40:40.460 --> 02:40:41.860
with them

02:40:41.860 --> 02:40:43.940
so that they can't dismiss

02:40:43.940 --> 02:40:46.460
will be okay i don't know if it's on state

02:40:46.460 --> 02:40:49.020
i don't think you'd have to show a little more diversity break say that

02:40:49.020 --> 02:40:51.700
yeah that's why i think

02:40:51.700 --> 02:40:53.860
that stuff would be picked up by these days like

02:40:53.860 --> 02:40:54.620
yet

02:40:54.620 --> 02:40:57.620
Because all trance music is pretty much the same anyways.

02:40:57.620 --> 02:41:00.620
It's just all synth with a backbeat, that's it.

02:41:00.620 --> 02:41:02.620
I'm surprised with the popularity of DDR.

02:41:02.620 --> 02:41:05.620
You're not hearing such cultish songs from DDR

02:41:05.620 --> 02:41:11.620
that are mega-popular, like Look to the Sky on some dance radio station at night.

02:41:11.620 --> 02:41:14.620
It's because we're in Sacramento and we don't have cool stations like that.

02:41:14.620 --> 02:41:16.620
Ours got kicked off the air, remember?

02:41:16.620 --> 02:41:18.620
Well, there's actually one kind of weird thing.

02:41:18.620 --> 02:41:23.620
One night I was actually coming back from CCL, just getting done playing DDR,

02:41:23.620 --> 02:41:29.100
I was listening to quad you know on Saturdays or whatever they play that like all that trancey stuff

02:41:29.100 --> 02:41:32.500
I actually did hear holic and actually did play it

02:41:32.980 --> 02:41:36.460
Yes, it was because we sat there and debated it for like an hour and a half

02:41:36.460 --> 02:41:38.980
And it actually was holic which I don't know how it got played

02:41:42.820 --> 02:41:45.100
Book fields and heard some to my beat playing out the kitchen

02:41:45.100 --> 02:41:50.100
I know, but that was the thing, I thought that was funny.

02:41:50.100 --> 02:41:52.100
I think Scottie D should have some stuff.

02:41:52.100 --> 02:41:54.100
Yeah.

02:41:54.100 --> 02:41:56.100
I forgot what I was going to say.

02:41:56.100 --> 02:41:59.100
But they should contract Avix tracks again.

02:41:59.100 --> 02:42:01.100
Like they did with Para Para.

02:42:01.100 --> 02:42:06.100
Why do you think Konami doesn't release Bimani soundtracks in the US?

02:42:06.100 --> 02:42:11.100
Besides the fact that DDR USA, the arcade versions, wouldn't have had a good soundtrack?

02:42:41.100 --> 02:42:51.100
There's about 25,000 registered users on DDRFreak, and a lot of soundtracks to real movies sell 5,000 at the most.

02:42:51.100 --> 02:42:57.100
I don't know, because usually what happens, they'll print mass amounts of the CDs because, you know, they do...

02:42:57.100 --> 02:43:05.100
I mean, you think actual artists like, you know, Britney Spears, millions of CDs get printed, and millions of them get bought, because that's just pop, you know?

02:43:05.100 --> 02:43:08.520
Because Konami is cheap and they don't want licensed music and licensing music for a game

02:43:08.520 --> 02:43:11.200
is expensive enough, let alone soundtrack rights as well.

02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:12.200
Yeah, you have to go for more red tape.

02:43:12.200 --> 02:43:15.160
And the fact that making the CDs themselves only costs pennies.

02:43:15.160 --> 02:43:20.160
I mean, it's just the whole licensing rights and because over here in America, we're bastards

02:43:20.160 --> 02:43:25.680
and we charge, or actually, the RIAA is bastards and they charge, you know, up the ass for,

02:43:25.680 --> 02:43:31.120
you know, licensing rights and copyright laws are crazy and it's just, it's a bad situation.

02:43:31.120 --> 02:43:32.120
That's why.

02:43:32.120 --> 02:43:38.400
All we're going to hear is more, like, uh, more fucking covers of Welcome to the Jungle

02:43:38.400 --> 02:43:41.280
and shit by crazy people who don't sound anything like Axl Rose.

02:43:41.280 --> 02:43:46.380
I'm not talking about trying to make, like, DDR music, like, mainstream, like, oh, next

02:43:46.380 --> 02:43:49.120
on MTV on Total Request Live number 10, drop the bomb, yeah!

02:43:49.120 --> 02:43:52.760
I'm not talking about that kind of thing, but just, like, trying to just at least put

02:43:52.760 --> 02:43:53.760
the music out there.

02:43:53.760 --> 02:43:55.800
If the music isn't out there, if you want the music, you have to go underground.

02:43:55.800 --> 02:44:11.800
Yeah, here's what I think. What I can debate why they don't do is maybe they're doing these releases on these home systems, you know, maybe for once release a small sound CD with the game if you pre-order or something, you know?

02:44:11.800 --> 02:44:20.800
Well, they did that with Max. Yeah, Toys R Us. Jamie's got one. Toys R Us did that. They had like a... What was the requirements, Jamie? Remember what you had to do to get that CD?

02:44:20.800 --> 02:44:23.400
No, I got mine from, uh, from...

02:44:23.400 --> 02:44:26.280
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you got yours donated.

02:44:26.280 --> 02:44:28.720
Quote, unquote. No, no, mine was, mine's real.

02:44:28.720 --> 02:44:31.000
It was given to me, uh... Quite, I know, but it was...

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:31.680
For attorney.

02:44:31.680 --> 02:44:35.680
It was a, yeah. I got a few of them that we gave out as prizes for attorney. Right.

02:44:35.680 --> 02:44:39.280
But, um, they do, right, I remember Toys R Us was doing something with those. I think if you

02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:42.880
pre-ordered at Toys R Us, you got that. I think that's how it worked.

02:44:42.880 --> 02:44:47.000
But still, I mean, that's not, that's not like, I can walk into Dimple and see it

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:50.560
in the soundtrack section, or, Dimple is, I'm sorry, because that's only in Sacramento,

02:44:50.560 --> 02:44:59.560
It's a record store, so let's say I can't walk into Virgin Megastore, and Virgin Megastore imports a lot of stuff. They don't import anything Japanese, which baffles me.

02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:02.560
Very limited, though. Very, very limited.

02:45:02.560 --> 02:45:04.560
I will grip a Dragon Ball DC.

02:45:04.560 --> 02:45:09.560
Okay, well, I'm talking like, I don't think you can find a Yumi Hamasaki even, right? You can even...

02:45:09.560 --> 02:45:10.560
You can order it from Dance Media.

02:45:10.560 --> 02:45:13.560
Really? Could you order Dance Media albums through Virgin? Hmm.

02:45:13.560 --> 02:45:15.560
You can totally order anything from Virgin.

02:45:15.560 --> 02:45:19.560
I went to the Virgin Megastore in San Francisco and I never see anything interesting Japanese-wise.

02:45:45.560 --> 02:45:57.560
And it's kind of the thing with America in general and the history of music, it's like pop has always been popular and it's always been the main thing, you know, and we, yeah, we all hate pop, but America goes through its phases.

02:45:57.560 --> 02:46:06.560
It's like, okay, first there's rap, like original rap, like 80s, late 70s rap, Sugarhill Gang rap, and then we go back to pop, you know, Billy Joel.

02:46:06.560 --> 02:46:13.560
Then we go to whatever the next thing is, you know, grunge or whatever, you know, and then we go back to pop.

02:46:13.560 --> 02:46:35.560
We go through these phases, and we already went through our techno trance rave music phase in the mid 90s, and it's gone now. It's not popular. There's a lot of people doing these things, but there's a lot of freaking people in America. A lot more people are listening to Britney Spears. I'm sorry. It's always going to be that way. It's always going to be pop.

02:46:35.560 --> 02:46:39.560
Not always, because music rotates itself every...

02:46:39.560 --> 02:46:42.560
Not that, I wouldn't say that long, probably about more like every four years.

02:46:42.560 --> 02:46:43.560
Okay, then watch.

02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:47.560
Four to ten years from now, we're going to see some Beaumont ECDs printed, finally.

02:46:47.560 --> 02:46:52.560
I'm going to tell you, now this is going to be a really strange sounding theory, and I know I'm going to get booze for this,

02:46:52.560 --> 02:46:55.560
but I'll tell you why Britney Spears and all that's on their way out the door.

02:46:55.560 --> 02:46:56.560
And this is going to sound funny.

02:46:56.560 --> 02:46:57.560
Because they suck.

02:46:57.560 --> 02:47:01.560
American Idol is the reason why Britney Spears is going to be on its way out the door.

02:47:01.560 --> 02:47:04.560
Because it's just, it's saturating, we're seeing too much of it.

02:47:04.560 --> 02:47:05.560
No.

02:47:05.560 --> 02:47:06.560
No.

02:47:06.560 --> 02:47:07.560
No.

02:47:07.560 --> 02:47:10.560
Look at the three people who are in the finals in American Idol right now.

02:47:10.560 --> 02:47:13.560
You have two overweight people and a dork.

02:47:13.560 --> 02:47:14.560
Exactly.

02:47:14.560 --> 02:47:16.440
What does that show America wants right now?

02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:20.680
They are sick and tired of seeing the same cookie cutter image.

02:47:20.680 --> 02:47:21.680
Yeah.

02:47:21.680 --> 02:47:23.880
And... exactly.

02:47:23.880 --> 02:47:24.880
So I'd say that's...

02:47:24.880 --> 02:47:28.640
That's why I'm saying they actually want to hear the music for once and not just the image.

02:47:28.640 --> 02:47:31.740
Far-fetched as it sounds, I think that might be starting to send a message to record companies

02:47:31.740 --> 02:47:42.740
I bet you, even sales of Christina's latest album wasn't as good as her first one, and Britney's putting a new one out in October, and it's probably not going to do as well. I think it's October, but it probably won't do as well.

02:47:42.740 --> 02:47:46.740
Well, wouldn't it be funny if Britney Spears pulled an Alanis?

02:47:46.740 --> 02:47:48.740
What do you mean? Disappeared and came back?

02:47:48.740 --> 02:47:50.740
Stop doing Happy Happy Poppy?

02:47:50.740 --> 02:47:53.740
Alanis used to be a very Happy Poppy person.

02:47:53.740 --> 02:48:00.740
I actually have a video, Alanis Morissette was considered the Tiffany of Canada, and she had the big poofy hair,

02:48:00.740 --> 02:48:04.940
Matt LeBlanc was in one of her videos, she was on the Canadian television, but she used to have, like, these songs.

02:48:04.940 --> 02:48:08.300
I could probably dig up the MP3s on my computer, but I'm too lazy.

02:48:08.300 --> 02:48:10.980
Um, but she used to have, like, really dancy songs.

02:48:10.980 --> 02:48:17.500
She disappeared completely for about four years, and then came back, and she'd, like, grown up, and that's when she did Jagged Little Pill,

02:48:17.500 --> 02:48:23.620
and it was such a, such a controversy, you know, like, oh, now this teen princess talking about blowjobs in a theater type thing.

02:48:23.620 --> 02:48:27.900
But I mean if you think about it the real Tiffany did the same thing didn't she come back and pose for Playboy?

02:48:31.340 --> 02:48:38.900
Well like I mean one thing that I've noticed too is all these people have hella videos and have all these concerts and all these

02:48:38.900 --> 02:48:40.180
fucking appearances

02:48:40.180 --> 02:48:44.620
They you know everybody hears that music so much that people just grow to get tired of it

02:48:44.620 --> 02:48:46.240
Then you got the underground people who?

02:48:46.240 --> 02:48:52.340
Will send their demo to a radio station or something get it played more people want to see more people want to hear

02:48:52.340 --> 02:48:57.020
the people who you don't see every day as opposed to who you do see every day I

02:48:57.020 --> 02:49:01.580
mean that's why I think like if we did have a lot of Bimani's music Bimani

02:49:01.580 --> 02:49:06.080
CDs coming over and or anybody even a lot of the underground you know rappers

02:49:06.080 --> 02:49:10.780
and DJs and stuff like that most people sit there and they don't really want to

02:49:10.780 --> 02:49:14.180
go to really see them they like to know who they are but they like the music so

02:49:14.180 --> 02:49:17.180
much and the music is what keeps the mystery and what keeps them want to be

02:49:17.180 --> 02:49:19.420
there if you don't do a lot of appearances people gonna want to know

02:49:19.420 --> 02:49:25.420
They're going to want to hear your stuff more than, like, oh, look, there's that hoe on TV. You know, it's that whole thing.

02:49:25.420 --> 02:49:31.420
Well, the DJs, they're just a name. They're just a name, so you know which CD to find. That's it.

02:49:31.420 --> 02:49:39.420
I mean, if you met them in real life, you're like, oh, they're really cool. You wouldn't be like, oh, I got a, oh, my God, you know, they're so cool.

02:49:39.420 --> 02:49:40.420
No, it's just, they're just...

02:49:40.420 --> 02:49:43.420
Wait, if I saw Paul Walkenfold, I'd probably give him a hug.

02:49:43.420 --> 02:49:44.420
Yeah, yeah.

02:49:44.420 --> 02:49:51.020
But like, for instance, um, DJ David X, I mean, he's kind of popular over here, I mean,

02:49:51.020 --> 02:49:54.420
you see him personally, like, damn, I don't, he's old.

02:49:54.420 --> 02:49:55.420
Yeah, he's just some...

02:49:55.420 --> 02:50:01.100
He's an actual friend of one of Dan's friends, he's a DJ in Santa Cruz.

02:50:01.100 --> 02:50:04.720
He's cool, but, and the music he plays is really cool, that's the whole point, though.

02:50:04.720 --> 02:50:09.100
It's not like, you know, Britney Spears, you hear more controversy and shit about them.

02:50:09.100 --> 02:50:13.980
When's the last time you've heard, like, a DJ and something weird happening with them?

02:50:13.980 --> 02:50:17.460
like oakenfold you never hear anything on the news like some controversy is it

02:50:17.460 --> 02:50:21.220
because he's just too busy making music and you know doing actual stuff like

02:50:21.220 --> 02:50:25.660
that. You know what actually has made me really happy is that one of my favorite

02:50:25.660 --> 02:50:31.820
Japanese DJ's has his CDs now released in the States DJ Crush makes me very

02:50:31.820 --> 02:50:38.260
very happy and from what I understand I mean he'll do music for anyone you know

02:50:38.260 --> 02:50:43.260
mixing for anyone just you know goes to clubs all the time. I wish he'd come actually

02:50:43.260 --> 02:50:45.700
Well, he had performed here because she even went to see him

02:50:46.800 --> 02:50:52.380
In San Francisco, I think but I would you know, I would like for for just more people internationally

02:50:52.920 --> 02:50:54.920
To make their music available

02:50:55.520 --> 02:50:58.860
Like one thing too and not a lot of people are familiar with the music

02:50:58.860 --> 02:51:02.880
But there's like the band called Dream Theater and I don't know how many people know about them

02:51:02.880 --> 02:51:05.000
But they're over in Japan a lot

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.440
I mean, that's their basic residence is in Japan

02:51:07.440 --> 02:51:13.720
Even though they're completely English singing group and their music sells a lot more over here

02:51:14.080 --> 02:51:16.240
Than they do over than it does in Japan

02:51:16.240 --> 02:51:22.440
I mean and they do they're just random appearances like once every five years you actually get to see them and it's enough to make

02:51:22.440 --> 02:51:27.360
A person want to drop everything and go see image because they don't have huge videos over here people like their music

02:51:27.360 --> 02:51:31.680
I mean, I honestly was about to cut my Santa Cruz trip because they're gonna be in Sacramento on Sunday

02:51:31.680 --> 02:51:34.160
And I was about to cut it, but I like nah, that's okay

02:51:34.160 --> 02:51:39.840
But it's still it's like the point is people will drop with what you're doing if they don't see you getting in trouble

02:51:39.840 --> 02:51:45.040
And they don't see you dressing like an absolute moron and all that kind of stuff, and there's still a hair band

02:51:45.400 --> 02:51:48.520
They are still a hair that is the hair band

02:51:49.560 --> 02:51:51.240
Interesting point I'm reading in the chat room

02:51:51.240 --> 02:51:55.960
I'm just trying to read what folks are saying in the chat room jabberwocky makes an interesting point hi by the way

02:51:57.320 --> 02:52:00.440
He was responding to a comment made on me by Justin

02:52:00.440 --> 02:52:04.780
The record companies put out hundreds of albums each month.

02:52:04.780 --> 02:52:08.000
The terrible music is what people are buying.

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.440
Why is that?

02:52:10.440 --> 02:52:14.840
I was about to say something about the record companies because they basically, I think,

02:52:14.840 --> 02:52:17.520
tell us what we're going to listen to.

02:52:17.520 --> 02:52:21.320
We all are speaking from what we know in our sphere of influence of how we love the music

02:52:21.320 --> 02:52:26.480
and stuff, but you got to remember the main population is going to follow what the record

02:52:26.480 --> 02:52:27.480
company puts out.

02:52:27.480 --> 02:52:32.460
they're putting out all this crappy music and it's getting sold. Why? Why does the record

02:52:32.460 --> 02:52:35.420
company do anything? Money? I don't know.

02:52:35.420 --> 02:52:40.180
This is my theory, the publicist behind the artist. I think there's a lot of wheeling

02:52:40.180 --> 02:52:45.340
and dealing that goes on, especially with MTV. And MTV is to, you know, if you want

02:52:45.340 --> 02:52:49.780
to use the word blame, credit, whatever you want to choose, MTV is really what's shaping

02:52:49.780 --> 02:52:51.740
the music industry right now, like it or not.

02:52:51.740 --> 02:52:52.740
It's all politics.

02:52:52.740 --> 02:52:53.740
Exactly, it's all politics.

02:52:53.740 --> 02:53:00.060
If my politics is the lobbyists pay the politicians, and that's how certain laws get passed. Although

02:53:00.060 --> 02:53:07.780
I kind of buy into the Josie theory. The Josie and the Pussycats. I will elaborate for people

02:53:07.780 --> 02:53:10.740
who haven't seen it.

02:53:10.740 --> 02:53:16.060
One thing too is this is only stuff that I picked up while working at Intercom Radio

02:53:16.060 --> 02:53:22.740
and stuff like that and a lot of it is not so much who is you know who's gonna

02:53:22.740 --> 02:53:27.940
dress I mean who's how old and who looks like what or whatever but part of it is

02:53:27.940 --> 02:53:32.620
the fact that they will go with whoever will dress trashy you know there's

02:53:32.620 --> 02:53:39.420
plenty of girls I out there I have seen shut up don't start no anyways no it's

02:53:39.420 --> 02:53:47.920
It's like, there's, they go to see who will dress like the slut, who will do, I mean there's

02:53:47.920 --> 02:53:51.560
plenty of girls out there who probably look like Britney Spears and who may sound like

02:53:51.560 --> 02:53:58.460
Britney Spears, but they're the ones who won't go as far as the others went.

02:53:58.460 --> 02:54:05.340
And then yeah, it is MTV partially, because they get tons of videos crossing their path

02:54:05.340 --> 02:54:06.340
every day.

02:54:06.340 --> 02:54:08.180
It doesn't mean they're going to play them all, they're going to play with the ones that

02:54:08.180 --> 02:54:12.420
that all the people are fantasizing about and go home and whack it off about or so if

02:54:12.420 --> 02:54:13.420
they do it.

02:54:13.420 --> 02:54:16.580
I mean, that's all it is.

02:54:16.580 --> 02:54:17.580
Nince makes...

02:54:17.580 --> 02:54:20.800
Okay, some interesting points here.

02:54:20.800 --> 02:54:24.860
Nince says in the chat room, people buy the terrible stuff because they don't know about

02:54:24.860 --> 02:54:26.420
the better stuff out there.

02:54:26.420 --> 02:54:27.420
Nince.

02:54:27.420 --> 02:54:28.420
That's actually exactly true.

02:54:28.420 --> 02:54:32.860
Well, and then this is interesting, a response from Jabberwocky, name terrible music, or

02:54:32.860 --> 02:54:35.020
is it just what is popular and what you don't like?

02:54:35.020 --> 02:54:37.540
Well, yeah, I guess terrible music is a...

02:54:37.540 --> 02:54:42.280
I mean, first of all, nobody in this room will pretty much admit to being a fan of Britney

02:54:42.280 --> 02:54:43.400
Spears or any of that stuff.

02:54:43.400 --> 02:54:50.040
I will admit that I like her stuff, I like some of her stuff, but it's getting old.

02:54:50.040 --> 02:54:52.760
I feel like, okay, the pop thing is getting old for me.

02:54:52.760 --> 02:54:56.440
I'm cycling on a four-year thing, you know, I don't really care about her new album anymore.

02:54:56.440 --> 02:54:57.440
She was cute back in the day.

02:54:57.440 --> 02:54:59.600
Oh, look, what a little slut dancing on the screen.

02:54:59.600 --> 02:55:00.600
But I don't care anymore.

02:55:00.600 --> 02:55:06.080
I'm a fan of her future porno with her and Christina Aguilera, hot lesbian action.

02:55:06.080 --> 02:55:14.180
Back to the point here, there's no real way to force people to expose themselves to new

02:55:14.180 --> 02:55:15.180
music.

02:55:15.180 --> 02:55:21.140
Yeah, I guess people will like what they want to like, but I feel like sometimes it's ignorance.

02:55:21.140 --> 02:55:24.260
We only hear what we can hear on the radio, most people.

02:55:24.260 --> 02:55:29.780
Your average music listener isn't a music lover, as in it's their life, they love it

02:55:29.780 --> 02:55:30.780
like I do.

02:55:30.780 --> 02:55:34.880
It's like I have to listen to music all the time, I go watch live music and stuff.

02:55:34.880 --> 02:55:38.580
All they can hear is the radio, so they're being told what to listen to, so that's one

02:55:38.580 --> 02:55:39.580
thing.

02:55:39.580 --> 02:55:42.720
Another thing, yeah, you can't tell them what to listen to, what's terrible music, one person

02:55:42.720 --> 02:55:43.920
likes something else.

02:55:43.920 --> 02:55:45.860
There is actually terrible music.

02:55:45.860 --> 02:55:48.880
I think Britney Spears and stuff is terrible music.

02:55:48.880 --> 02:55:54.320
There's no talent behind it except for she has boobs, she has an ass, she can't sing

02:55:54.320 --> 02:55:55.320
worth shit.

02:55:55.320 --> 02:55:56.880
I've heard so many people who can sing better.

02:55:56.880 --> 02:56:01.160
What do you, okay, what do you think, hold on, hold on, hold on, question, question.

02:56:01.160 --> 02:56:08.160
What do you think about those people on like the fan shows that talk about Britney Spears

02:56:10.280 --> 02:56:12.560
and say, Britney Spears changed my life?

02:56:12.560 --> 02:56:16.320
I think it's sad.

02:56:16.320 --> 02:56:20.720
There's fans of everyone, okay? I'm sure Bob Saget has a huge following. I'm sure Carrot

02:56:20.720 --> 02:56:21.440
Top has a huge following.

02:56:21.440 --> 02:56:26.040
I love Bob Saget, man. I just saw Dick for Coker. What was it?

02:56:26.040 --> 02:56:31.520
There's fans for everybody. There is, there's fans for anybody that appears on TV for like

02:56:31.520 --> 02:56:37.900
just a second. Perfect example, G-Force Portal, that stupid guy that had, he has fans, okay?

02:56:37.900 --> 02:56:41.800
That proves right there that anybody can have fans. We have fans, okay? I mean, it's a-

02:56:41.800 --> 02:56:44.440
Oh, there you go. There's proof right there. We have fans.

02:56:44.440 --> 02:56:45.440
So, no-

02:56:45.440 --> 02:56:46.440
Maybe not me.

02:56:46.440 --> 02:56:49.480
Here's my point. The point is that they'll have fans. They'll have, you know, a certain

02:56:49.480 --> 02:56:53.160
group of people are talking good about them and everything. That's gonna be a given. The

02:56:53.160 --> 02:56:58.120
The fact is that they just, you know, it's just mainstream stuff right now. Like, for

02:56:58.120 --> 02:57:02.180
instance, I don't know really why people buy their CDs and stuff since it's played on the

02:57:02.180 --> 02:57:07.880
record all or on the radio all the time. Like, for instance, 98 Rock in our Sacramento area

02:57:07.880 --> 02:57:12.120
here plays the same shit every day. I can guarantee that I'll hear like a few songs,

02:57:12.120 --> 02:57:17.320
you know, certain songs every day. It's just like a same playlist that's randomized.

02:57:17.320 --> 02:57:22.600
When I worked at 98 Rock, we, my eight-hour shift, you would hear a song 12 times and

02:57:22.600 --> 02:57:26.600
I know it would be the exact same, say, maybe 13, 14 songs.

02:57:26.600 --> 02:57:30.600
It would hear the same song 12 times a day, at least in one eight-hour shift.

02:57:30.600 --> 02:57:32.600
You know what, though? I'll say this, though.

02:57:32.600 --> 02:57:35.600
I got called from 98 Rock a couple times over at the radio station.

02:57:35.600 --> 02:57:37.600
I don't know how I ended up on their list or whatever,

02:57:37.600 --> 02:57:41.600
but they called and would ask me to listen to little seconds of songs.

02:57:41.600 --> 02:57:44.600
And the only reason I did it, I usually don't participate in those phone survey things,

02:57:44.600 --> 02:57:47.600
but I actually knew I'm like, okay, what I'm saying might actually really have an effect

02:57:47.600 --> 02:57:50.600
on what they're going to play on the station, so I should participate.

02:57:50.600 --> 02:57:54.820
funny because a lot of the songs I'd never heard of before. It was actually interesting.

02:57:54.820 --> 02:57:59.640
So they were trying to test stuff I'd never heard before, but the majority of it that

02:57:59.640 --> 02:58:03.200
I found in myself liking was kind of a lot of the mainstream stuff, I'd say, just because

02:58:03.200 --> 02:58:06.780
I was familiar with it. But at the same time, there was a lot of that stuff I did recognize

02:58:06.780 --> 02:58:08.000
as me not liking.

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:12.980
I took one of those where they'd have me compare to, and my response to actually a lot of what

02:58:12.980 --> 02:58:15.980
they'd play, I would be like, I don't like either, I don't like either, I don't like

02:58:15.980 --> 02:58:20.980
either until they'd play like music that sounded like it wasn't cookie-cut

02:58:20.980 --> 02:58:23.700
because for me and you know what I listen to I've listened to some really

02:58:23.700 --> 02:58:27.260
interesting stuff while you've been in it what's in my car right now

02:58:27.260 --> 02:58:32.500
kana and yeah I'm a Japanese music okay I forgot to tell you there's totally a

02:58:32.500 --> 02:58:37.140
different subject Garrett ordered a video of kana videos and so he's gonna

02:58:37.140 --> 02:58:40.060
get it soon and you're gonna have to come over and watch them because I

02:58:40.060 --> 02:58:45.140
showed him the I it's not a DVD it's a tape but I showed him the one and like

02:58:45.140 --> 02:58:48.880
He's just like I have to see the other so I just sorry I forgot to tell you earlier

02:58:50.360 --> 02:58:52.360
CD Japan

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:58.860
It's like basically I mean if you want to find like you like good music

02:58:58.920 --> 02:59:04.800
Why don't you just do it a lot of people do because every different type of music has this why don't you go out and buy?

02:59:04.800 --> 02:59:10.420
Like samplers because samplers a lot of the times not all the time it depends on which label you go through

02:59:10.420 --> 02:59:17.440
They will play new bands that not a lot of people have heard of and that yeah compilations and stuff like that go find those

02:59:17.800 --> 02:59:19.800
Play it listen to them honestly

02:59:20.260 --> 02:59:24.120
Yeah, movie soundtracks also because honestly you're gonna find most music

02:59:24.120 --> 02:59:30.020
You're gonna have you're gonna have in your music collections if you start buying compilation samplers are gonna be all the ones you got off

02:59:30.020 --> 02:59:32.020
Of those it's I mean, it's so basically

02:59:32.500 --> 02:59:33.720
You know it really sucks

02:59:33.720 --> 02:59:38.280
But stop listening to the fucking radio for five minutes and go out and spend five bucks and buy a damn sampler

02:59:40.640 --> 02:59:45.980
Irene oh, yeah, I just have a really simple basic theory, okay

02:59:46.600 --> 02:59:51.800
It's just that people are going for what's familiar and what's

02:59:52.940 --> 02:59:55.280
Simple something that's not too complex

02:59:56.000 --> 02:59:58.620
Yeah, exactly. You know they they you know

02:59:58.620 --> 03:00:04.480
Oh, yeah, so they go for Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera because it's simple

03:00:04.480 --> 03:00:09.240
It's not too hard, but then everyone goes through you know their cycles of music. They change

03:00:09.240 --> 03:00:14.460
I mean, I'm not listening to same stuff. I listen to ten years ago five years ago, whatever so I mean it always evolved

03:00:14.460 --> 03:00:19.400
So yeah, I'm gonna pass let's try and wrap this up. I just wanted to say I just want to say really quick

03:00:19.400 --> 03:00:23.360
Okay, go for Jimmy. Well, if you look at it like what do we have today the Backstreet Boys?

03:00:23.680 --> 03:00:26.680
You know when I was in middle school, we had new kids on the block

03:00:26.680 --> 03:00:42.680
In the 70's there was the Partridge Family, but there was David Cassidy. He had fangirls when he died. We have the same thing happen today over these poppy people. It's because they have an image that can be sold.

03:00:42.680 --> 03:01:00.680
Here's the thing. Michael Jackson, he is a pop artist, but he is talented, and that's why he deserves fans, because he writes good music, and he helps produce good music. Maybe not recently, but he certainly knows how to make headlines.

03:01:00.680 --> 03:01:07.680
You can still be a nutjob and do good music, so to say.

03:01:30.680 --> 03:01:35.400
himself cholera-infected water so that he would die because

03:01:35.400 --> 03:01:37.560
i was going to say that passed about five minutes ago

03:01:37.560 --> 03:01:38.640
as i say i am

03:01:38.640 --> 03:01:43.560
uh... as you're saying about their radio and you know stop was really or whatever

03:01:43.560 --> 03:01:46.560
trying and this is going to be really cheap blood but i'm serious here

03:01:46.560 --> 03:01:47.680
good internet radio

03:01:47.680 --> 03:01:49.680
look around the light three six five a m

03:01:49.680 --> 03:01:52.000
uh... thousands of stations

03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:54.920
that uh... with your time to listen to if you want to sample new music

03:01:54.920 --> 03:01:57.480
internet radio is a great way to do it because you have

03:01:57.480 --> 03:02:01.140
you have weirdos like us sitting here to put together their own stations of

03:02:01.140 --> 03:02:04.500
stuff they like and how do you find out about a lot of music through your

03:02:04.500 --> 03:02:08.380
friends and what they like so go go look at some uh... other stations of our life

03:02:08.380 --> 03:02:10.660
is exact we give you permission

03:02:10.660 --> 03:02:14.260
we give you permission to go away from one hundred for a little while to go out

03:02:14.260 --> 03:02:16.900
check out some other stations but not very long you got back

03:02:16.900 --> 03:02:17.960
uh...

03:02:17.960 --> 03:02:19.800
uh... thirty minutes ago

03:02:19.800 --> 03:02:22.400
but what i was going to say

03:02:22.400 --> 03:02:24.080
you're talking about uh...

03:02:24.080 --> 03:02:27.240
uh... van gogh or that i had to do is a very good

03:02:27.240 --> 03:02:28.480
instead of talker

03:02:28.480 --> 03:02:31.400
artist he's high on absent and cut off your way do

03:02:31.400 --> 03:02:34.960
he said it was girlfriend he said his girlfriend as like a mall

03:02:34.960 --> 03:02:39.560
well i wonder at the letter said can you hear me now

03:02:39.560 --> 03:02:41.800
and that doesn't make sense but it was funny

03:02:41.800 --> 03:02:43.360
uh... looking together

03:02:43.360 --> 03:02:45.800
you have a final thought i did have a thought on the

03:02:45.800 --> 03:02:47.360
stuff but i think we

03:02:47.360 --> 03:02:49.500
here's the thought that i have

03:02:49.500 --> 03:02:55.420
Go online, get your nice file-sharing service, and download massive amounts of MP3s from

03:02:55.420 --> 03:02:59.700
artists you don't recognize. Don't buy the CDs, because, you know, stupid artists, you

03:02:59.700 --> 03:03:03.300
know, they don't deserve money, because if their music sucks, then, you know, they should

03:03:03.300 --> 03:03:07.060
learn, okay, no one's buying my CD, maybe I should think of a new career, you know?

03:03:07.060 --> 03:03:13.080
Did you put the disclaimer at the beginning that some of these people, their views and

03:03:13.080 --> 03:03:17.380
opinions do not, you know, reflect the opinions of Orange Lounge Radio?

03:03:17.380 --> 03:03:19.380
They don't know that by now they're retarded

03:03:20.380 --> 03:03:22.540
You know what? He's absolutely right though

03:03:22.540 --> 03:03:27.540
If you can't make music stop making crappy music if you have enough people telling you hey, buddy

03:03:27.540 --> 03:03:30.820
You're shitty did stop making music sometimes that doesn't work

03:03:30.820 --> 03:03:36.900
But what okay back to the Britney Spears not only what about the one that says you changed my life through your music

03:03:36.900 --> 03:03:40.900
There's always going to be somebody who says that.

03:03:40.900 --> 03:03:43.900
Guess what, um, Ghost in the Shell changed my life.

03:03:43.900 --> 03:03:46.900
Because it made me want to be a ghost in the shell.

03:03:46.900 --> 03:03:49.900
You know, it's stupid.

03:03:49.900 --> 03:03:51.900
Yes, now I know how to make Lego sex.

03:03:51.900 --> 03:03:53.900
First off, all those people who are saying, oh this changed my life.

03:03:53.900 --> 03:03:57.900
First and foremost, the only one you should change your life for is yourself.

03:03:57.900 --> 03:03:58.900
You're shallow.

03:03:58.900 --> 03:04:00.900
You need to take responsibility for yourself.

03:04:00.900 --> 03:04:02.900
That's sad that one song changes your life.

03:04:02.900 --> 03:04:06.900
That is the biggest problem with people today is they don't take responsibility for themselves.

03:04:06.900 --> 03:04:09.900
Yeah, that scares me that Britney Spears is changing all these youngins' life.

03:04:09.900 --> 03:04:11.900
It just scares me for my future.

03:04:11.900 --> 03:04:15.900
They're hitting the responsibility for their changes on other people.

03:04:15.900 --> 03:04:17.900
They're blaming other people for what's going on in their lives.

03:04:17.900 --> 03:04:20.900
They need to start taking responsibility and be their own person.

03:04:20.900 --> 03:04:22.900
So you're changing your life?

03:04:22.900 --> 03:04:22.900
Yeah.

03:04:22.900 --> 03:04:23.900
Yeah, changing my life.

03:04:23.900 --> 03:04:27.900
Now I wear short skirts and I have sex with everybody.

03:04:27.900 --> 03:04:28.900
We need more of those people.

03:04:28.900 --> 03:04:32.900
Okay, well, what an excellent way to fill a half hour.

03:04:32.900 --> 03:04:36.900
We're kind of past our 9.30 time now, so away from that topic now.

03:04:36.900 --> 03:04:38.900
Thanks you guys, that was really good.

03:04:38.900 --> 03:04:40.900
Wow, this has been a really good show tonight.

03:04:40.900 --> 03:04:42.900
We had a professional discussion.

03:04:42.900 --> 03:04:45.900
We had intelligent conversation and debate.

03:04:45.900 --> 03:04:48.900
I guess that's debatable, and I'm sure our chat room debates that right now.

03:04:48.900 --> 03:04:50.900
We talked about porn, we worked porn in.

03:04:50.900 --> 03:04:54.900
Okay, yeah, we got the blowjob thing in at the beginning.

03:04:54.900 --> 03:05:01.900
Alright, we worked at the truck stop. Okay, so now I'm going to ask everybody, thank you

03:05:01.900 --> 03:05:06.140
everybody, what a good way to end season 2. What a very nice way to end the season 2 finale

03:05:06.140 --> 03:05:12.100
there. Just a reminder everybody, next week, no show, but we got an even better thing planned,

03:05:12.100 --> 03:05:20.860
Saturday live all freaking day from B3, the tournament of the century at Pier 39. We might

03:05:20.860 --> 03:05:27.500
be there Sunday as well. Don't know yet. We'll see. Anyway, let me go around and get some

03:05:27.500 --> 03:05:29.940
final thoughts from everybody. Jamie, you want to start or you want to be last?

03:05:29.940 --> 03:05:36.740
I'll be last. Okay. Brad, final thought. Tough.

03:05:36.740 --> 03:05:44.140
What lesson did we learn today, kids? Music industry is communism. Don't follow him.

03:05:44.140 --> 03:05:48.580
Okay. Irene, final thought? It doesn't have to be about the topic we've been discussing.

03:05:48.580 --> 03:05:50.860
anything you want

03:05:50.860 --> 03:05:55.680

Take everything I have we have said about the radio and use it in your daily life

03:06:33.460 --> 03:06:38.060
Don't be conformist and be an individual and don't let don't let people tell you

03:06:38.420 --> 03:06:40.900
What to do and don't let them tell you what to like

03:06:40.900 --> 03:06:47.460
Be yourself, or else we'll just have a bunch of robots running around and it'll just end

03:06:47.460 --> 03:06:49.740
up being the destruction of the human fucking race.

03:06:49.740 --> 03:06:50.740
Goodbye.

03:06:50.740 --> 03:06:52.640

03:06:52.640 --> 03:06:56.160

It's been almost a year now that we've been doing Orange Launch.

03:07:18.540 --> 03:07:19.540
It's been a blast.

03:07:19.540 --> 03:07:23.540
And in two weeks, we come back to you with Orange Launch Radio Season 3.

03:07:23.540 --> 03:07:25.540
We're going to have a webcam of some sorts to show things

03:07:25.540 --> 03:07:27.540
when we want to show them to you.

03:07:27.540 --> 03:07:29.540
Phones, we're working on it.

03:07:29.540 --> 03:07:30.540
Loki is busy.

03:07:30.540 --> 03:07:32.540
We were hoping that the phones would be the big thing

03:07:32.540 --> 03:07:33.540
we can bring into Season 3.

03:07:33.540 --> 03:07:34.540
We don't know if we can have it the first week,

03:07:34.540 --> 03:07:36.540
but Loki is on it,

03:07:36.540 --> 03:07:38.540
and we all know that that means scary.

03:07:38.540 --> 03:07:41.540
Scary, so thank you everybody for your support. We appreciate it.

03:07:41.540 --> 03:07:43.540

03:07:43.540 --> 03:07:44.540
Loki, quick...

03:07:44.540 --> 03:07:47.540
Well, I'm going to let Jamie do her final thought and then we'll end with yours.

03:07:47.540 --> 03:07:49.540
Jamie?

03:07:49.540 --> 03:07:52.540
Mine is give me a dollar.

03:07:52.540 --> 03:07:55.540
Len Loki, dare I ask what's your final thought?

03:07:55.540 --> 03:08:02.540
What I don't understand in this world is how there can be so many hidden camera people with these ugly guys going out,

03:08:02.540 --> 03:08:05.540
finding people in random places and then gaining them to do sexual acts on them.

03:08:05.540 --> 03:08:12.540
So I leave you with yet another streetblowjob.com video.
