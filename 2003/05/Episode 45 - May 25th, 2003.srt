1
00:00:00,289 --> 00:00:03,272
[SPEAKER_08]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, Season 3.

2
00:00:04,173 --> 00:00:07,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Now with 200% more hot monkey sex.

3
00:00:08,276 --> 00:00:10,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Just kidding.

4
00:00:10,438 --> 00:00:13,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio will not contain 200% more hot monkey sex.

5
00:00:14,102 --> 00:00:16,784
[SPEAKER_09]: It will contain 300% more hot monkey sex.

6
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:18,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, cut the cut.

7
00:00:18,325 --> 00:00:21,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I guess it's back to the real intro.

8
00:00:21,048 --> 00:00:22,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on, I'm having fun too.

9
00:00:31,412 --> 00:00:35,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

10
00:00:39,099 --> 00:00:43,961
[SPEAKER_10]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio for mommy talk and then some.

11
00:00:44,661 --> 00:00:47,362
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

12
00:00:47,722 --> 00:00:51,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

13
00:00:52,384 --> 00:00:57,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

14
00:00:57,746 --> 00:01:01,467
[SPEAKER_10]: You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

15
00:01:01,788 --> 00:01:03,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I will spank your child.

16
00:01:03,648 --> 00:01:05,389
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

17
00:01:10,131 --> 00:01:10,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Well...

18
00:01:11,078 --> 00:01:12,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's to my big opening.

19
00:01:12,758 --> 00:01:13,919
[SPEAKER_17]: A sphincter says what?

20
00:01:14,059 --> 00:01:16,159
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm super, thanks for asking.

21
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:19,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.

22
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,440
[SPEAKER_07]: What am I doing here?

23
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:22,881
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

24
00:01:23,021 --> 00:01:24,341
[SPEAKER_10]: Dodge this.

25
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:26,681
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a tasty burger.

26
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:29,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.

27
00:01:29,602 --> 00:01:30,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I have.

28
00:01:30,682 --> 00:01:32,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, just a flesh wound.

29
00:01:32,703 --> 00:01:38,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a polyshorum.

30
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:40,611
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah?

31
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:44,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

32
00:01:44,394 --> 00:01:45,455
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.

33
00:01:45,635 --> 00:01:46,436
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got a sniff.

34
00:01:46,796 --> 00:01:47,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Sky.

35
00:01:47,437 --> 00:01:49,519
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

36
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:50,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

37
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,681
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate you!

38
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:54,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge Radio.

39
00:01:55,224 --> 00:01:59,828
[SPEAKER_15]: Orange Lounge Radio is now live for this episode 45 here on May 25th of 2003.

40
00:02:03,143 --> 00:02:09,648
[SPEAKER_15]: You're tuned into the B-Money Scene's most sarsy radio station of all things B-Money.

41
00:02:12,771 --> 00:02:14,852
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

42
00:02:15,413 --> 00:02:17,294
[SPEAKER_15]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.

43
00:02:17,314 --> 00:02:20,116
[SPEAKER_15]: In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

44
00:02:20,157 --> 00:02:21,458
[SPEAKER_15]: You know her better as DarkSakura.

45
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:26,122
[SPEAKER_15]: Who just coughed up a lung?

46
00:02:26,822 --> 00:02:27,163
[SPEAKER_15]: Very nice.

47
00:02:27,323 --> 00:02:29,785
[SPEAKER_15]: You might want to go buy some masks at Walgreens or something.

48
00:02:29,805 --> 00:02:31,706
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I was going to buy some in San Francisco.

49
00:02:31,726 --> 00:02:34,708
[SPEAKER_05]: We found Star Wars masks in the Japan Center Mall.

50
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:36,169
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

51
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:39,311
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost bought some, but I bought them on my own.

52
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:41,613
[SPEAKER_05]: I have more Battle Royale.

53
00:02:43,534 --> 00:02:45,476
[SPEAKER_15]: In that corner, say hello to our Tech Master, Loki.

54
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:51,520
[SPEAKER_15]: Is anybody feeling well?

55
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:51,820
[SPEAKER_15]: God.

56
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,452
[SPEAKER_15]: Also with us tonight, we have a whole assload of guests.

57
00:02:57,632 --> 00:02:59,493
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of them are out in the pool, but some of them are in-house.

58
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,734
[SPEAKER_15]: First off, she's never been on the show before.

59
00:03:02,154 --> 00:03:04,815
[SPEAKER_15]: Be gentle and say hello to Maren Chan.

60
00:03:05,515 --> 00:03:06,115
[SPEAKER_16]: Where am I?

61
00:03:06,135 --> 00:03:08,216
[SPEAKER_16]: And what is this silver collar around my neck?

62
00:03:11,537 --> 00:03:11,958
[SPEAKER_15]: Beautiful.

63
00:03:12,738 --> 00:03:14,338
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, some old favorites.

64
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:16,699
[SPEAKER_15]: Old and moldy, but still fresh.

65
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,660
[SPEAKER_15]: Say hello to Dark Tetsuya.

66
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,201
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, old and moldy.

67
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:20,721
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

68
00:03:22,441 --> 00:03:23,801
[SPEAKER_15]: Say hello to DDR Angel.

69
00:03:24,021 --> 00:03:25,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

70
00:03:26,662 --> 00:03:28,183
[SPEAKER_15]: And say hello to the 23rd Magus.

71
00:03:28,383 --> 00:03:29,363
[SPEAKER_15]: Moldy, but still fresh.

72
00:03:30,483 --> 00:03:32,184
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that about Tofu?

73
00:03:32,624 --> 00:03:34,565
[SPEAKER_15]: And, oh, we got some people at the door.

74
00:03:34,665 --> 00:03:35,045
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

75
00:03:35,165 --> 00:03:35,705
[SPEAKER_15]: More people.

76
00:03:35,785 --> 00:03:36,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Just what we need right now.

77
00:03:36,865 --> 00:03:38,226
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see.

78
00:03:38,546 --> 00:03:40,346
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's hold off and see what comes through the door.

79
00:03:43,127 --> 00:03:45,408
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, it's... Aww.

80
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:48,409
[SPEAKER_15]: Aww, it's Loki's girlfriend.

81
00:03:48,749 --> 00:03:48,829
[SPEAKER_15]: Aww.

82
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:50,910
[SPEAKER_15]: You are cute.

83
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,330
[SPEAKER_15]: Come here.

84
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,090
[SPEAKER_15]: Come here and say hello.

85
00:03:52,111 --> 00:03:53,011
[SPEAKER_15]: You've never been on the show.

86
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:54,112
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, she's shy.

87
00:03:54,512 --> 00:03:55,633
[SPEAKER_15]: She's shy.

88
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:56,774
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, well.

89
00:03:59,536 --> 00:04:02,077
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so I guess we'll get started with the show.

90
00:04:02,858 --> 00:04:08,241
[SPEAKER_15]: There's also four people that are out in the pool right now who aren't even in here right now, so maybe we'll hear from them later.

91
00:04:08,502 --> 00:04:09,242
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, guess what, kids?

92
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:10,603
[SPEAKER_15]: It's our season three premiere.

93
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,164
[SPEAKER_15]: Yay.

94
00:04:12,324 --> 00:04:16,227
[SPEAKER_15]: Which means on the show tonight, somebody will get married, have a baby, or die.

95
00:04:17,782 --> 00:04:18,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we going to jump the shark?

96
00:04:19,624 --> 00:04:20,885
[SPEAKER_15]: Tonight we jump the shark.

97
00:04:22,086 --> 00:04:23,767
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we did that with the first episode.

98
00:04:24,468 --> 00:04:26,710
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Orange Lodge Radio jumped the shark on the first episode.

99
00:04:28,365 --> 00:04:31,568
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell all your friends and all your lovers that Orange Lens Radio is now on the air.

100
00:04:31,588 --> 00:04:32,268
[SPEAKER_15]: And all your enemies.

101
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:35,050
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're set for a big show tonight.

102
00:04:35,071 --> 00:04:36,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that your enemies on fire first?

103
00:04:36,992 --> 00:04:39,654
[SPEAKER_15]: We have two weeks of stuff to catch up on.

104
00:04:40,175 --> 00:04:40,855
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot tonight.

105
00:04:41,516 --> 00:04:44,798
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to start this off with a song that created some big news this week.

106
00:04:44,878 --> 00:04:45,939
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a brand new song.

107
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:47,781
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be a Max 2 USA.

108
00:04:48,782 --> 00:04:50,683
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's a group called Four Strings.

109
00:04:50,743 --> 00:04:52,845
[SPEAKER_15]: And this song is Take Me Away Into The Night.

110
00:04:53,265 --> 00:04:54,947
[SPEAKER_15]: And we'll be right back, boys and girls.

111
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:50,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Take me away, million miles away from here Take me away, find a place for you and me You're taking me higher, high as I could be Take me away, forever you

112
00:06:51,750 --> 00:07:16,012
[SPEAKER_07]: A million miles away from me Take me away Find a place for you and me You're taking me higher Higher as I could be Take me away Forever you and me Take me away

113
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,560
Thanks for watching!

114
00:09:45,706 --> 00:09:48,128
[SPEAKER_10]: It's more contagious than SARS!

115
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:58,317
[SPEAKER_15]: Orange Lounge Radio Yes, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, boys and girls.

116
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:03,541
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, there's shirtless men walking into my apartment.

117
00:10:04,943 --> 00:10:06,324
[SPEAKER_15]: It's April Fool's, it must be.

118
00:10:09,287 --> 00:10:13,410
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, anyway, hi.

119
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,911
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody just got flashed.

120
00:10:16,312 --> 00:10:18,013
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

121
00:10:18,453 --> 00:10:19,574
[SPEAKER_15]: It's our season premiere.

122
00:10:19,834 --> 00:10:23,296
[SPEAKER_15]: As you can tell, we just had some nudity on this show.

123
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,718
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow, it's like we're having a whole fashion show.

124
00:10:26,738 --> 00:10:31,582
[SPEAKER_15]: New characters coming in with gratuitous nudity in the first two minutes of the show.

125
00:10:34,143 --> 00:10:36,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Damn, too bad we weren't able to get the webcam up today after all.

126
00:10:37,677 --> 00:10:39,080
[SPEAKER_15]: Say hello, new people.

127
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,964
[SPEAKER_15]: Introduce yourselves to the listeners of Orange Lounge Radio.

128
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,789
[SPEAKER_15]: They're both running away.

129
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:44,431
[SPEAKER_15]: You're not shy.

130
00:10:44,491 --> 00:10:44,731
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on.

131
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:46,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wet and I don't want to be on the radio right now.

132
00:10:46,956 --> 00:10:47,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

133
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:50,678
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, it's going to be one of those nights.

134
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,599
[SPEAKER_15]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

135
00:10:54,879 --> 00:11:05,981
[SPEAKER_15]: If you want to join our chat room, because the other party's on in the chat room, go to www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and then click on chat.

136
00:11:06,621 --> 00:11:09,962
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's how you can join in our chat room.

137
00:11:11,142 --> 00:11:12,942
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't believe you guys are already getting out of the pool.

138
00:11:13,863 --> 00:11:14,963
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so sad.

139
00:11:14,983 --> 00:11:15,943
[SPEAKER_15]: I had to cry.

140
00:11:19,335 --> 00:11:19,895
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, what?

141
00:11:21,716 --> 00:11:22,036
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

142
00:11:24,157 --> 00:11:25,477
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, snooty people came in and ruined the pool.

143
00:11:25,537 --> 00:11:27,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, anyway, hi, back to the show.

144
00:11:29,358 --> 00:11:30,659
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, Irene and Brad just came in.

145
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:31,099
[SPEAKER_15]: Say hello.

146
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:32,299
[SPEAKER_05]: How was the pool?

147
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:32,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

148
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:33,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are you afraid of pools?

149
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

150
00:11:47,938 --> 00:11:49,038
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie, why are you afraid of pools?

151
00:11:49,218 --> 00:11:51,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Because little children pee and go poo.

152
00:11:52,319 --> 00:11:56,201
[SPEAKER_05]: I was at a public pool once, and I saw a big turd floating in the pool.

153
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:00,062
[SPEAKER_15]: That reminds me of Caddyshack.

154
00:12:00,382 --> 00:12:01,702
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually saw it happen.

155
00:12:03,643 --> 00:12:09,685
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, let's talk about things that have happened while we were last on the air, which was two weeks ago.

156
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:10,425
[SPEAKER_05]: I got SARS.

157
00:12:12,085 --> 00:12:13,326
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, go in the shower.

158
00:12:14,606 --> 00:12:15,506
[SPEAKER_15]: We're trying to do a show here.

159
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:15,766
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello.

160
00:12:16,327 --> 00:12:17,507
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie, how was your two weeks?

161
00:12:18,426 --> 00:12:19,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it was okay.

162
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,469
[SPEAKER_05]: We sort of did a show last weekend, sort of.

163
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:26,290
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we broadcasted all day long from B3.

164
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,191
[SPEAKER_15]: What did you guys think of B3?

165
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:30,953
[SPEAKER_15]: What did you think of B3, the big tournament that happened at Pier 39?

166
00:12:31,473 --> 00:12:33,974
[SPEAKER_05]: I sort of missed all of Sunday because I decided to go to the mall.

167
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:34,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?

168
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:45,648
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know, do you think B3, because a lot of people online were kind of like, kind of had this kind of, like you know how B3 is supposed to be like this huge tournament, you know, it's going to be like the biggest tournament ever?

169
00:12:45,908 --> 00:12:48,349
[SPEAKER_15]: And a lot of people just came back from it feeling kind of mediocre.

170
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:50,150
[SPEAKER_15]: They were like, eh, PA kind of dominated the whole thing.

171
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,051
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was timing, because there was a lot going on around there.

172
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,651
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree, I think it was just bad timing.

173
00:12:54,691 --> 00:13:03,015
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the original plan for B3 is that they were supposed to do it over spring break, and I think that would have been cool, but the time they did it just kind of turned out...

174
00:13:03,935 --> 00:13:04,255
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

175
00:13:04,856 --> 00:13:10,378
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's too bad, because they ended up doing it the same weekend as E3, which caused a lot of confusion in the names alone.

176
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:17,702
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's weird, though, because everything at the tournament was put together really well, and everything was run really well.

177
00:13:17,822 --> 00:13:20,363
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, sure, it ran a little late, but all tournaments do.

178
00:13:20,924 --> 00:13:27,667
[SPEAKER_15]: But yet, despite how great everything ran, everybody was just kind of bleh.

179
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:31,689
[SPEAKER_15]: And freestyle, with the exception of two routines, was kind of bleh.

180
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:33,645
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

181
00:13:34,305 --> 00:13:35,566
[SPEAKER_15]: That's my little rant on B3.

182
00:13:36,026 --> 00:13:38,407
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's certainly nobody's fault.

183
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:44,669
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just kind of like, I think everybody just kind of must have had... I think everybody was on their collective period or something.

184
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:45,429
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's what it is.

185
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,130
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie, you're staring off into space.

186
00:13:49,671 --> 00:13:51,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, uh, yeah.

187
00:13:51,691 --> 00:13:52,071
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

188
00:13:52,172 --> 00:13:53,472
[SPEAKER_15]: You have anything you want to say about B3, Loki?

189
00:13:55,616 --> 00:14:04,369
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I didn't get a badge, and I didn't get a chair until after I asked, and I didn't get my free shirt does, promise.

190
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:06,933
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, yeah.

191
00:14:08,295 --> 00:14:10,078
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what, um, B3, it...

192
00:14:12,415 --> 00:14:14,697
[SPEAKER_15]: Stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp

193
00:14:36,591 --> 00:14:47,213
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it gives me incentive anyway to broadcast for more tournaments in the future.

194
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:48,613
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you guys shut the door?

195
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:50,554
[SPEAKER_15]: Jesus.

196
00:14:52,794 --> 00:14:54,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Irene's speaking in on Garrett.

197
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,655
[SPEAKER_15]: I have three people in my shower right now.

198
00:14:58,615 --> 00:15:00,235
[SPEAKER_15]: This is all the season premiere stuff going on.

199
00:15:00,255 --> 00:15:04,316
[SPEAKER_15]: We had nudity, new characters, and now they're all in my shower at the same time.

200
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:06,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw Garrett's ass.

201
00:15:06,952 --> 00:15:09,293
[SPEAKER_02]: He's showing me a scar by his ass.

202
00:15:09,313 --> 00:15:09,773
[SPEAKER_02]: How funny.

203
00:15:15,356 --> 00:15:18,477
[SPEAKER_00]: She says she's right here, staying in the studio, not even taking a shower.

204
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:21,698
[SPEAKER_00]: But she's in the shower.

205
00:15:21,758 --> 00:15:22,259
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe her.

206
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,782
[SPEAKER_15]: Segway, Segway, while we were sort of on the subject of B3, Loki, I believe you owe me something?

207
00:15:30,682 --> 00:15:32,343
[SPEAKER_15]: Perhaps, I don't know, an apology.

208
00:15:33,364 --> 00:15:34,084
[SPEAKER_15]: As promised.

209
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,571
[SPEAKER_13]: You are on the spot!

210
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:39,674
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki's eyes got really big like a deer in headlights.

211
00:15:39,734 --> 00:15:40,714
[SPEAKER_15]: He doesn't even remember.

212
00:15:42,436 --> 00:15:43,597
[SPEAKER_15]: What the hell are you talking about?

213
00:15:43,617 --> 00:15:48,040
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

214
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,461
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell are you talking about?

215
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:50,102
[SPEAKER_15]: Seriously?

216
00:15:54,445 --> 00:15:54,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Of what?

217
00:15:56,007 --> 00:15:57,848
[SPEAKER_15]: You need to remind Loki what he said that made you mad.

218
00:15:57,868 --> 00:16:00,150
[SPEAKER_05]: How many of us actually keep up with what goes on in these episodes?

219
00:16:04,457 --> 00:16:09,338
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe there was this really bad, wait, what was the second day of freestyle?

220
00:16:10,238 --> 00:16:11,719
[SPEAKER_15]: First day was PAM freestyle.

221
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:24,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it was a really bad freestyle, and then you're like, oh my god, if these people that were here were at Shaft and booing Magus off, they would boo the other guy off instead and cheer Magus on.

222
00:16:24,722 --> 00:16:25,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I was confused.

223
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:25,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, whatever.

224
00:16:25,962 --> 00:16:27,923
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, because that guy really sucked.

225
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:33,844
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, he was like, oh my god, spazzing up on the pad.

226
00:16:34,485 --> 00:16:37,786
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is really for me who went out to go get Oyakodon.

227
00:16:37,806 --> 00:16:39,586
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, no apologies, sorry.

228
00:16:43,387 --> 00:16:45,107
[SPEAKER_15]: As Magus shows Loki his IQ of 1.

229
00:16:46,528 --> 00:16:47,348
[SPEAKER_15]: Very, very nice.

230
00:16:49,488 --> 00:16:51,189
[SPEAKER_15]: I hear you turning dials.

231
00:16:52,869 --> 00:16:54,229
[SPEAKER_05]: This camera is the suck.

232
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,431
[SPEAKER_05]: No wonder these are buy one get one free, they're ass.

233
00:17:04,451 --> 00:17:06,472
[SPEAKER_05]: So why are we having all this dead airspace, Rob?

234
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:09,854
[SPEAKER_15]: I have no idea, because I'm too distracted by the people in my shower right now.

235
00:17:10,554 --> 00:17:13,756
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I keep hearing nudity and oh my god and ass and tattoo and scarf.

236
00:17:13,776 --> 00:17:15,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't you just put them all out in the yard and get the water hose?

237
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:21,160
[SPEAKER_00]: First, Irene walks in the door when Garrett's changing.

238
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,600
[SPEAKER_00]: She doesn't bother knocking.

239
00:17:23,181 --> 00:17:27,843
[SPEAKER_00]: This time she knows that he's in the shower, but she opens the shower curtain anyway.

240
00:17:28,604 --> 00:17:29,364
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's naked.

241
00:17:29,644 --> 00:17:31,285
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a towel around him, okay?

242
00:17:36,397 --> 00:17:37,118
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

243
00:17:58,021 --> 00:17:59,041
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, I caught it!

244
00:17:59,061 --> 00:17:59,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Woohoo!

245
00:17:59,782 --> 00:17:59,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

246
00:18:00,402 --> 00:18:02,323
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, tell us about the movie we watched Thursday night.

247
00:18:02,763 --> 00:18:04,584
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucked ass, kinda.

248
00:18:04,924 --> 00:18:08,165
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kinda boring and I don't even know why the hell you got me to watch it.

249
00:18:09,966 --> 00:18:12,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Never rent whatever the hell that movie was.

250
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,407
[SPEAKER_04]: It was bad.

251
00:18:17,068 --> 00:18:18,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Envy of the dot dot dot.

252
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:21,634
[SPEAKER_15]: The film that we watched was called Envy.

253
00:18:21,854 --> 00:18:23,095
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, it says Envy on the box.

254
00:18:23,155 --> 00:18:25,176
[SPEAKER_15]: It's actual full title is called Penis Envy.

255
00:18:25,736 --> 00:18:28,137
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a story about these two drifting chicks.

256
00:18:28,157 --> 00:18:29,378
[SPEAKER_15]: They're walking through the desert.

257
00:18:29,838 --> 00:18:31,979
[SPEAKER_15]: They go to this bar and they get really drunk.

258
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:34,560
[SPEAKER_15]: And I mean, this is talking about like white trash America.

259
00:18:35,121 --> 00:18:36,902
[SPEAKER_15]: They get drunk and they're walking through the desert.

260
00:18:37,022 --> 00:18:40,323
[SPEAKER_15]: And all of a sudden they go, gee, wouldn't it be great to have a penis?

261
00:18:40,683 --> 00:18:48,207
[SPEAKER_15]: And so they walk around and lo and behold, when this one chick's taking a piss, they find the penis fairy, which is this giant drag queen.

262
00:18:48,687 --> 00:18:49,227
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, Loki?

263
00:19:03,618 --> 00:19:04,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it Mr. Spanky?

264
00:19:04,638 --> 00:19:05,759
[SPEAKER_15]: That was beautiful, thank you.

265
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:38,185
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, let's try to focus on some Bomani news, because there was lots of it while we were gone for two weeks.

266
00:19:38,705 --> 00:19:49,148
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Max 2 USA was the big kind of announcement that, well, there were several games that were announced at E3, the big convention that none of us got to go to, because nobody takes this show seriously.

267
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I could have gone.

268
00:19:50,968 --> 00:19:52,908
[SPEAKER_15]: You could have been able to go, but not because of this show.

269
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:54,269
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't get off work.

270
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:55,369
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I'm sorry.

271
00:19:57,202 --> 00:20:01,165
[SPEAKER_15]: But there were lots of fun things discussed at E3.

272
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:15,436
[SPEAKER_15]: First off was Max 2 USA, and we heard a bunch of songs were announced for inclusion, including Days Go By by Dirty Vegas, the song you heard in the last break, Four Strings Take Me Away Into The Night, and also Jocelyn and Rika's A Little Bit Of Ecstasy.

273
00:20:15,516 --> 00:20:19,799
[SPEAKER_15]: All those songs, by the way, are in rotation right now on our station, so if you want to check them out.

274
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:26,825
[SPEAKER_15]: But what's interesting, what I find really interesting about Max 2 USA is that the real music videos are going to be in the backgrounds now.

275
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,490
[SPEAKER_16]: That's going to be pretty cool.

276
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:39,333
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you think that there's going to be an option where you can select, oh, I want the big seizure, flashy-looking graphics, amazing Japanese fun, or you can have the real music video?

277
00:20:42,314 --> 00:20:44,755
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but it doesn't bother me either way.

278
00:20:45,395 --> 00:20:48,676
[SPEAKER_15]: I wonder if they're going to have long versions because of the music videos.

279
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:51,177
[SPEAKER_15]: Long versions, that would be interesting.

280
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:55,318
[SPEAKER_15]: You know they've promised, I guess, different modes that we haven't seen in the U.S.

281
00:20:55,378 --> 00:20:55,738
[SPEAKER_15]: before?

282
00:20:59,145 --> 00:21:01,646
[SPEAKER_15]: So, like, music video mode, like, where you could just watch the videos.

283
00:21:01,986 --> 00:21:06,086
[SPEAKER_15]: Kind of like, okay, you remember in 2DX6 style how you could just watch the videos if you wanted to?

284
00:21:06,406 --> 00:21:07,467
[SPEAKER_15]: You think they'll have something like that?

285
00:21:07,487 --> 00:21:09,107
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be cool.

286
00:21:09,847 --> 00:21:10,687
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, that would be neat.

287
00:21:11,147 --> 00:21:17,809
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I know, I've had gatherings where people just put in 6th style and watch the videos and drank.

288
00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:21,549
[SPEAKER_05]: I could go for some drink.

289
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:25,090
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they have the mode where you get to meet Kuriyama Oka?

290
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,250
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

291
00:21:28,331 --> 00:21:31,773
[SPEAKER_00]: He was at E3, and yeah.

292
00:21:31,933 --> 00:21:35,496
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't really give a shit about Max 2 USA, or any DDR.

293
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,117
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to see Akira Moka.

294
00:21:40,238 --> 00:21:41,999
[SPEAKER_15]: Why don't you give a shit about Max 2 USA?

295
00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:44,361
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I'll tell you right now, it's going to be better than Japanese Max 2.

296
00:21:44,401 --> 00:21:47,042
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I played the Japanese Max 2 for three days, and I haven't played since.

297
00:21:48,503 --> 00:21:50,144
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this DDR sucks.

298
00:21:51,385 --> 00:21:52,345
[SPEAKER_00]: I play Beatmania.

299
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:54,426
[SPEAKER_00]: When are they going to bring out a new console Beatmania?

300
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:55,267
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I care about.

301
00:21:57,526 --> 00:21:59,187
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, that was the other interesting bit of news.

302
00:21:59,227 --> 00:22:05,412
[SPEAKER_15]: There was this big rumor going around that Konami was going to... I know we talked about this on the show, and we read it with extreme caution.

303
00:22:05,432 --> 00:22:06,593
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I called it, didn't I?

304
00:22:06,933 --> 00:22:07,273
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah.

305
00:22:07,673 --> 00:22:10,355
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm pretty sure we all approached it with this big bit of skepticism.

306
00:22:10,515 --> 00:22:12,977
[SPEAKER_15]: If I remember right, the news source wasn't a very trustworthy one.

307
00:22:13,437 --> 00:22:22,524
[SPEAKER_15]: But they were announcing 2DX USA, and they were going to have a machine brought to E3, and they were going to bring in, like, Take and Yes... Or, no, not them.

308
00:22:22,584 --> 00:22:23,204
[SPEAKER_15]: Lisu and...

309
00:22:24,185 --> 00:22:24,786
[SPEAKER_15]: Who's the other guy?

310
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:25,247
[SPEAKER_15]: Agop.

311
00:22:25,587 --> 00:22:30,974
[SPEAKER_15]: They're going to bring in Lisu and Agop and have them playing at E3 to show Americans how to play 2DX?

312
00:22:31,315 --> 00:22:32,156
[SPEAKER_15]: What a bunch of crap.

313
00:22:33,998 --> 00:22:35,040
[SPEAKER_15]: So that didn't end up happening.

314
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:37,002
[SPEAKER_15]: But I don't know.

315
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:40,667
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm pretty sure we talked about it on the show before, but does the USA really deserve 2DX?

316
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:56,601
[SPEAKER_14]: If they brought 2DX to the USA, it wouldn't sell for shit, like how everyone said that they complained that frequency was too difficult, so they made Amplitude easier, and hence it became an even bigger piece of crap.

317
00:22:58,361 --> 00:22:59,242
[SPEAKER_15]: I like Amplitude.

318
00:22:59,262 --> 00:23:05,404
[SPEAKER_15]: Would you like to repeat that for our listeners?

319
00:23:06,244 --> 00:23:07,344
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Super Sprout.

320
00:23:07,484 --> 00:23:08,725
[SPEAKER_00]: That song's cool, and that's about it.

321
00:23:10,194 --> 00:23:14,076
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, so before we move on to other games, nobody has any other thoughts on Max 2 USA?

322
00:23:14,156 --> 00:23:15,396
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, is anybody looking forward to it?

323
00:23:16,076 --> 00:23:17,317
[SPEAKER_15]: Um... Nobody cares?

324
00:23:17,577 --> 00:23:20,598
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be out, but, you know... It'll be fun for about a week.

325
00:23:21,278 --> 00:23:21,898
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, though?

326
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,319
[SPEAKER_05]: I am going to have the Xbox one.

327
00:23:24,459 --> 00:23:25,720
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah, that's the other one we can talk about.

328
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,801
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no choice because we get everything cool that comes out on Xbox.

329
00:23:31,262 --> 00:23:34,623
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I got Steel Battalion, of course I'm going to have DDR.

330
00:23:34,903 --> 00:23:36,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Although the dance pad looks retarded.

331
00:23:36,924 --> 00:23:37,464
[SPEAKER_05]: It's green.

332
00:23:37,945 --> 00:23:38,765
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's official, though.

333
00:23:41,152 --> 00:23:43,255
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know, the dance pads are kind of scary to me.

334
00:23:43,315 --> 00:23:44,616
[SPEAKER_15]: They're all freaky looking.

335
00:23:45,177 --> 00:23:46,258
[SPEAKER_05]: They're Xbox-y.

336
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:48,501
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Xbox, everything is freaky looking.

337
00:23:49,342 --> 00:23:50,764
[SPEAKER_05]: They're actually Konami-made pads.

338
00:23:53,255 --> 00:23:59,878
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you know the producer of the DDR Xbox game was on DDR Freak earlier this week, and he said a few things about the game, which are interesting.

339
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:06,061
[SPEAKER_15]: He says that the look of the game that they showed at E3 is not representative of the final gameplay.

340
00:24:06,601 --> 00:24:12,163
[SPEAKER_15]: So in that version there was no 3D, no music videos, and haven't even begun to show what the Xbox is capable of.

341
00:24:12,723 --> 00:24:18,566
[SPEAKER_15]: So I guess that's kind of interesting, because I guess in a way they're saying, hey, Max 2 USA was further along than DDR Xbox was.

342
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:27,633
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, Freeze Arrows will be in DDR Ultramix, except there were none in E3.

343
00:24:28,794 --> 00:24:30,695
[SPEAKER_15]: They're going to be able to play it online.

344
00:24:30,715 --> 00:24:34,577
[SPEAKER_15]: So you're going to be able to get on Xbox Live and have live rankings and statistics.

345
00:24:35,476 --> 00:24:46,986
[SPEAKER_15]: and your individual scores will be able to be ranked with the rest of the people via a live connection and you can also have edited step data and you can upload and download that by users and new songs will be released on a monthly basis for download.

346
00:24:47,306 --> 00:24:50,649
[SPEAKER_15]: However, there's a rumor going around that says you might have to pay for these songs.

347
00:24:50,709 --> 00:24:51,069
[SPEAKER_15]: Who knows?

348
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,391
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, what is that about?

349
00:24:53,431 --> 00:25:00,317
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, if it were like for the licensed stuff, I could understand, but if it were for Konami originals, I mean, that doesn't sound fair.

350
00:25:02,193 --> 00:25:04,794
[SPEAKER_15]: Especially if they're all songs we've played to death already.

351
00:25:04,874 --> 00:25:09,115
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think I could rationalize paying like five bucks for a new song or something, you know?

352
00:25:10,215 --> 00:25:14,396
[SPEAKER_15]: Would anybody here actually admit to paying for new DDR songs just so they could have everything?

353
00:25:14,696 --> 00:25:14,896
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

354
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:18,397
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, that's a no.

355
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,358
[SPEAKER_15]: How about the chatroom?

356
00:25:20,678 --> 00:25:21,018
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

357
00:25:21,418 --> 00:25:22,719
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not even watching the chatroom right now.

358
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:24,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Chatroom?

359
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:25,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares about them?

360
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,040
[SPEAKER_15]: We do.

361
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:27,860
[SPEAKER_15]: I love chatroom.

362
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:31,361
[SPEAKER_05]: You hang out in our chatroom?

363
00:25:32,091 --> 00:25:33,852
[SPEAKER_15]: It sounds like a cheap, interesting way to make money.

364
00:25:34,693 --> 00:25:36,594
[SPEAKER_15]: But don't you... Correct me if I'm wrong, Jamie.

365
00:25:36,614 --> 00:25:38,135
[SPEAKER_15]: You're the one that's played Xbox online.

366
00:25:38,255 --> 00:25:39,375
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think anyone else here has.

367
00:25:39,756 --> 00:25:42,117
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I watched Dan play it.

368
00:25:42,357 --> 00:25:43,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Street Fighter.

369
00:25:44,138 --> 00:25:46,160
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't you have to pay per month for that anyway?

370
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:47,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Xbox Live?

371
00:25:48,021 --> 00:25:48,281
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

372
00:25:48,801 --> 00:25:49,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

373
00:25:49,722 --> 00:25:52,924
[SPEAKER_15]: So now you're going to have to pay per month and pay per song you want to download.

374
00:25:52,944 --> 00:25:53,564
[SPEAKER_05]: You shouldn't have to.

375
00:25:53,824 --> 00:25:54,064
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.

376
00:25:54,144 --> 00:25:54,625
[SPEAKER_15]: That's gay.

377
00:25:55,946 --> 00:25:57,607
[SPEAKER_15]: It's called licensing rights.

378
00:25:57,887 --> 00:25:58,167
[SPEAKER_15]: Yay!

379
00:25:59,721 --> 00:26:01,821
[SPEAKER_15]: Pretty soon there's going to be a Napster for DDR.

380
00:26:06,162 --> 00:26:07,702
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, why not?

381
00:26:07,842 --> 00:26:08,643
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, think about it.

382
00:26:08,763 --> 00:26:10,103
[SPEAKER_15]: You're downloading a program.

383
00:26:10,123 --> 00:26:14,324
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, people could share programs online.

384
00:26:14,484 --> 00:26:15,124
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, why not?

385
00:26:16,044 --> 00:26:18,504
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure they'll have a site where you can download them illegally.

386
00:26:20,945 --> 00:26:28,266
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, also the producer of Ultramix says that there's going to be 55 songs planned for the US version, 10 of those licensed.

387
00:26:29,031 --> 00:26:32,914
[SPEAKER_15]: And if I'm not mistaking, only five of them in Max USA were licensed.

388
00:26:32,974 --> 00:26:34,255
[SPEAKER_15]: So, that's going to be interesting.

389
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:39,518
[SPEAKER_15]: And also, kind of a big one, there's no Ultramix PC version.

390
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:41,480
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a big rumor that it was going to be out for the PC.

391
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,121
[SPEAKER_15]: That got shot down.

392
00:26:43,781 --> 00:26:48,665
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason why I pretty much figured it wouldn't happen, there's already DDRPC.

393
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:50,486
[SPEAKER_05]: But it sucks.

394
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:51,867
[SPEAKER_15]: It really sucks.

395
00:26:51,887 --> 00:26:52,948
[SPEAKER_05]: It does, true, but...

396
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:56,228
[SPEAKER_05]: You know why Pump It Up for PC worked?

397
00:26:56,688 --> 00:26:56,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

398
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:59,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Pump It Up was made for a PC anyway.

399
00:26:59,689 --> 00:27:00,389
[SPEAKER_15]: That's very true.

400
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,971
[SPEAKER_15]: It runs off the PC software anyways.

401
00:27:05,892 --> 00:27:10,654
[SPEAKER_15]: All the big Pump It Up machine that giant machine is, it's just there's a little PC in there that runs everything.

402
00:27:11,614 --> 00:27:11,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

403
00:27:12,941 --> 00:27:17,143
[SPEAKER_15]: But I don't know, I think, but you know, what's weird about DDRPC, look at Stepmania.

404
00:27:17,543 --> 00:27:19,904
[SPEAKER_15]: Stepmania does it way better than DDRPC did.

405
00:27:20,204 --> 00:27:31,548
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's kind of like, you can't use the excuse that it's not possible to do on a computer, because Stepmania, hey, if they'd released something like that as DDRPC, I bet a lot of people would have been, you know, would have been, wow, this is great.

406
00:27:33,448 --> 00:27:37,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Stepmania, and then we'll go, oh, I'll just download all these songs or make my own that I think are better.

407
00:27:39,506 --> 00:27:43,830
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, do you think that maybe that's why they've given up on DDRPC, because of Step Mania?

408
00:27:44,811 --> 00:27:46,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I would probably think so.

409
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:49,354
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, how can you compete with something that's free?

410
00:27:50,976 --> 00:27:53,158
[SPEAKER_15]: Why do you think Konami hasn't sued the people who made Step Mania?

411
00:27:54,307 --> 00:27:55,268
[SPEAKER_15]: Anybody want to venture a guess?

412
00:27:55,588 --> 00:28:16,020
[SPEAKER_05]: I would think, well, first of all, the programming itself, if they did not, what's the word I'm trying to think, reverse engineer it, if they actually made it right from scratch with their own source, they can't sue them for using, that's the whole problem with Bleem, why they couldn't do Bleem, because they made their program for Bleem from scratch.

413
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,102
[SPEAKER_15]: Can't they sue for the whole look and feel thing, though?

414
00:28:19,382 --> 00:28:22,704
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm thinking back to, you remember when Street Fighter 2 was out, and then I think,

415
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:29,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Some other third party company, I want to say Data East, put out a game called like Fighting Streets or something like that.

416
00:28:30,819 --> 00:28:31,759
[SPEAKER_15]: Was it Fighters History?

417
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:33,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they used the Street Fighter engine.

418
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,821
[SPEAKER_15]: And they got sued and all this stuff?

419
00:28:35,861 --> 00:28:37,341
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's because they used the Street Fighter engine.

420
00:28:37,381 --> 00:28:37,701
[SPEAKER_15]: Did they?

421
00:28:39,002 --> 00:28:41,163
[SPEAKER_15]: But I would think, you know, that whole look and feel thing would come to play.

422
00:28:41,183 --> 00:28:45,724
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, obviously none of us want to see the step many people get sued, but you know, it's a question that has to be asked.

423
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:46,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Why hasn't it happened yet?

424
00:28:46,865 --> 00:28:49,306
[SPEAKER_15]: Especially if Konami wants to be competitive in the PC market.

425
00:28:50,126 --> 00:28:50,326
[SPEAKER_15]: Angel?

426
00:28:52,912 --> 00:28:53,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

427
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:57,633
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Angel.

428
00:28:58,273 --> 00:29:04,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Puppy just pointed out in the chat room that Stepmania is open source code, so, I mean, he's got a point there.

429
00:29:05,214 --> 00:29:06,214
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, yeah, that's a good point.

430
00:29:06,734 --> 00:29:08,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is what Jamie just pointed out, so, you know.

431
00:29:12,715 --> 00:29:19,357
[SPEAKER_15]: It's open source, so even if they did get sued, it's kind of like, it doesn't matter at this point because the cat's already out of the bag.

432
00:29:23,815 --> 00:29:26,277
[SPEAKER_15]: So, hmm, interesting thought.

433
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,801
[SPEAKER_15]: How do you guys think the online play is going to work?

434
00:29:30,841 --> 00:29:33,183
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anything you guys would like to see online for DDR?

435
00:29:33,223 --> 00:29:40,749
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I think that whole, like, being able to play with somebody at the same time, it's kind of stupid, because you can't see them.

436
00:29:40,849 --> 00:29:41,430
[SPEAKER_15]: What would you see?

437
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:44,913
[SPEAKER_15]: You'd just see this second side of your screen getting perfect, good, boo.

438
00:29:46,397 --> 00:29:53,739
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you'll see fifty wasted dollars coming out of your check every month for spending on Xbox Live, the biggest piece of bullshit ever.

439
00:29:55,199 --> 00:29:57,699
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for that happy comment, Mr. Brad.

440
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:07,461
[SPEAKER_15]: Um... Okay, so we've got DDR Xbox out of the way.

441
00:30:08,082 --> 00:30:09,942
[SPEAKER_15]: How about Karaoke Revolution?

442
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:10,982
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you guys think of this?

443
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:14,443
[SPEAKER_05]: This is kind of the... I hate karaoke, so...

444
00:30:15,202 --> 00:30:16,203
[SPEAKER_15]: You hate karaoke?

445
00:30:16,223 --> 00:30:17,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because I don't sing, remember?

446
00:30:17,904 --> 00:30:18,365
[SPEAKER_15]: I cry.

447
00:30:19,065 --> 00:30:22,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I like watching other people so I can make fun of them, but I don't like doing it.

448
00:30:23,048 --> 00:30:28,012
[SPEAKER_15]: This is interesting, though, because it's the first, it's kind of the first U.S.-only Bomani game.

449
00:30:28,032 --> 00:30:30,674
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, it is?

450
00:30:30,694 --> 00:30:37,019
[SPEAKER_15]: Kind of, yeah, they haven't made any, well, I mean, they have games like it in Japan, but not Konami, and not in the Bomani series.

451
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:37,980
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry?

452
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,482
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought they had a karaoke revolution machine or something.

453
00:30:40,979 --> 00:30:47,302
[SPEAKER_15]: The closest thing they have to a Karaoke Revolution machine, I remember seeing this, it was a DDR slash karaoke machine.

454
00:30:47,782 --> 00:30:48,562
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like both.

455
00:30:49,703 --> 00:30:50,683
[SPEAKER_15]: But who could follow that?

456
00:30:50,843 --> 00:30:52,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you know what I saw at Network the other day?

457
00:30:52,964 --> 00:30:53,144
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

458
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:54,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Aerobics Revolution.

459
00:30:55,845 --> 00:30:57,226
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah, that finally came out, huh?

460
00:30:57,466 --> 00:31:01,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I was tempted to pick it up, but it was like $75 and more expensive.

461
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,389
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I was going to pay $75 in a game, I would have picked up Final Fantasy X-2.

462
00:31:06,305 --> 00:31:08,606
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what, like, Aerobics Revolution wouldn't even be worth it.

463
00:31:09,206 --> 00:31:14,467
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw a bunch of screenshots of it, and it looks really kind of odd.

464
00:31:14,647 --> 00:31:16,368
[SPEAKER_14]: Loses the whole point.

465
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:23,590
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, seriously, it is like they just, like they said, you're doing some 80s James Fonda kind of thing to it.

466
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,030
[SPEAKER_14]: It's got, like, some chicks on it.

467
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:28,171
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, you're trying to follow their moves as you're stepping on the pad.

468
00:31:28,711 --> 00:31:34,793
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, yeah, you're doing aerobics stuff, and you just so happen to be standing on a pad, too, while you're doing it.

469
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:35,753
[SPEAKER_14]: So...

470
00:31:37,845 --> 00:31:43,327
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep, my cheap camera What was that song that we figured out was confirmed for Karaoke Revolution?

471
00:31:43,367 --> 00:32:05,836
[SPEAKER_15]: We figured out there's some Jennifer Love Hewitt song we figured out by the screen captures that's going to be in it for sure I don't know We found out the other day and we forgot already But Jennifer Love Hewitt was Jennifer Love Hewitt was there at E3 singing And it was off her latest CD but it wasn't the one that's the name of the CD Oh well

472
00:32:11,491 --> 00:32:14,433
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, we're going to go ahead and take a quick break.

473
00:32:14,513 --> 00:32:16,574
[SPEAKER_15]: And when we come back, we'll talk about more of E3.

474
00:32:18,075 --> 00:32:19,956
[SPEAKER_15]: And we'll do the fuck you's of the week.

475

[SPEAKER_15]: So you can send those to me over private message in the chat room.

[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Sky, and you can send those to me.

477
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:26,879
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you're not in our chat room, you should be.

479
00:32:32,222 --> 00:32:36,805
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll talk a little more about E3 and all that garbage when we get back.

480
00:32:38,526 --> 00:32:39,066
[SPEAKER_15]: Enjoy.

[SPEAKER_06]: Follow the sound, follow the sound, and even the rain behind.

482
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:07,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Together we'll be in harmony, taking the time.

483
00:35:39,826 --> 00:35:42,630
Thanks for watching!

484
00:37:02,662 --> 00:37:11,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

485
00:37:11,545 --> 00:37:19,469
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

486
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:20,389
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome back, everybody.

487
00:37:21,729 --> 00:37:25,311
[SPEAKER_15]: We decided to play some happy Rayvar songs in that last break, so we hope you enjoyed.

488
00:37:27,588 --> 00:37:29,049
[SPEAKER_15]: We also figured out what song it is.

489
00:37:29,149 --> 00:37:30,490
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be in Karaoke Revolution.

490
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,531
[SPEAKER_15]: It's called Hey Everybody.

491
00:37:32,672 --> 00:37:35,154
[SPEAKER_15]: It's from Jennifer Love Hewitt.

492
00:37:36,495 --> 00:37:37,395
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm sure it sucks.

493
00:37:37,736 --> 00:37:38,876
[SPEAKER_15]: But how did you find that song?

494
00:37:39,697 --> 00:37:45,381
[SPEAKER_15]: Based off of the lyrics that are shown in the screen caps on the Konami website, actually.

495
00:37:45,401 --> 00:37:49,404
[SPEAKER_15]: They have a few pictures up that aren't from the E3 showing.

496
00:37:49,484 --> 00:37:51,146
[SPEAKER_15]: So I got it off of that.

497
00:37:52,146 --> 00:37:54,148
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you did a lyric search and there you go.

498
00:37:54,788 --> 00:37:55,309
[SPEAKER_15]: Amazing.

499
00:37:56,178 --> 00:38:04,140
[SPEAKER_15]: But, um, it was during the break, somebody, I think it was, I don't know if it was Garrett or somebody commented that the chick in Karaoke Revolution in the screenshots looks like an American Idol reject.

500
00:38:05,821 --> 00:38:07,301
[SPEAKER_15]: She, actually, you know what she looks like?

501
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:10,502
[SPEAKER_15]: Has anybody ever played the Spice World video game for PlayStation?

502
00:38:10,782 --> 00:38:12,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh god, that game sucks.

503
00:38:12,483 --> 00:38:16,244
[SPEAKER_15]: Where they have, like, the giant head and the little, little anorexic body?

504
00:38:16,924 --> 00:38:18,584
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what that chick looked like to me.

505
00:38:18,604 --> 00:38:23,966
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping everybody was moaning and groaning because they haven't played it and they're sad that you're the only one who has.

506
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:25,691
[SPEAKER_15]: Aw, don't cry for me.

507
00:38:25,711 --> 00:38:28,355
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to know that all these people have played the Spice Roam game.

508
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:30,839
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really... I know your girlfriend has.

509
00:38:30,859 --> 00:38:32,801
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a free rental and I wanted to see how bad it was.

510
00:38:33,743 --> 00:38:34,924
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, get this.

511
00:38:34,944 --> 00:38:39,290
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I met my ex-girlfriend, the very first day I meet her, she's like...

512
00:38:41,759 --> 00:38:47,244
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to, she said, you know, you have to see this game, and so I'm like, oh no, Spice World, what is this?

513
00:38:47,645 --> 00:38:55,452
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she showed me what was so funny about it, and yeah, it was pretty funny, but you guys must have been really drunk when you first saw that game, or when you thought about buying that game, Rob.

514
00:38:55,632 --> 00:38:58,735
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to be drunk.

515
00:38:59,196 --> 00:39:02,799
[SPEAKER_15]: I do own that game, it's in a deep, I think it's in my closet.

516
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,462
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm gonna have to go take it out at some point.

517
00:39:07,806 --> 00:39:09,588
[SPEAKER_15]: So, yeah, what else was announced at E3?

518
00:39:09,608 --> 00:39:10,288
[SPEAKER_15]: I know there were other games.

519
00:39:10,308 --> 00:39:13,891
[SPEAKER_15]: What about other cool games, just non-Bomani necessarily, that y'all are looking forward to?

520
00:39:14,592 --> 00:39:15,592
[SPEAKER_15]: I know Brad had one.

521
00:39:16,993 --> 00:39:20,316
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, Brad, tell me about some games you're looking forward to at E3.

522
00:39:20,496 --> 00:39:21,417
[SPEAKER_15]: Not necessarily Bomani.

523
00:39:23,158 --> 00:39:25,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, Konami stuff, or just anything?

524
00:39:26,401 --> 00:39:26,681
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything.

525
00:39:26,761 --> 00:39:35,708
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, Half-Life 2, Metal Gear Solid 3, Metal Gear Solid Twin Snakes, and Castlevania, Lament of Innocence.

526
00:39:37,452 --> 00:39:39,913
[SPEAKER_17]: What's the weird voice acting?

527
00:39:39,933 --> 00:39:41,093
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the weird voice acting?

528
00:39:41,313 --> 00:39:43,774
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, but it's not as bad as Die, Monster!

529
00:39:44,454 --> 00:39:45,935
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't belong in this world!

530
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:48,876
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to do another Dracula X game with Richter.

531
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:52,317
[SPEAKER_15]: A new Gradius game, definitely.

532
00:39:53,017 --> 00:39:56,238
[SPEAKER_15]: Mario Kart Double Dash.

533
00:39:57,358 --> 00:39:59,479
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a new Sam & Max game.

534
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,021
[SPEAKER_15]: New Sam & Max game, new Full Throttle game from LucasArts.

535
00:40:07,464 --> 00:40:09,085
[SPEAKER_15]: Who cares about that game?

536
00:40:09,105 --> 00:40:10,967
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see what else.

537
00:40:11,787 --> 00:40:14,949
[SPEAKER_15]: There's... I don't know.

538
00:40:15,069 --> 00:40:15,710
[SPEAKER_15]: There's cool games.

539
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,871
[SPEAKER_15]: Mario Party 5, bitches.

540
00:40:19,552 --> 00:40:23,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Mario Advance 4, Super Mario Bros.

541
00:40:24,335 --> 00:40:23,915
3.

542
00:40:25,877 --> 00:40:28,238
[SPEAKER_15]: Or the new Pokemon Stadium on GameCube.

543
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,201
[SPEAKER_11]: Metroid Zero Mission.

544
00:40:34,422 --> 00:40:35,343
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah, the new Metroid.

545
00:40:35,363 --> 00:40:35,503
[SPEAKER_15]: Metroid.

546
00:40:37,509 --> 00:40:38,310
[SPEAKER_11]: No, advance.

547
00:40:39,611 --> 00:40:39,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

548
00:40:45,416 --> 00:40:45,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

549
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:47,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Neopets.

550
00:40:48,118 --> 00:40:48,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's right.

551
00:40:48,758 --> 00:40:50,340
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a Neopets game coming out, huh?

552
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,040
[SPEAKER_05]: For PS2.

553
00:40:51,841 --> 00:40:52,401
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, God.

554
00:40:52,982 --> 00:40:53,903
[SPEAKER_15]: The world is ending.

555
00:40:55,304 --> 00:40:57,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan brought back a million copies of that Army game.

556
00:40:59,828 --> 00:41:00,748
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not related to... The U.S.

557
00:41:00,808 --> 00:41:01,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Army put out.

558
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:02,730
[SPEAKER_15]: The U.S.

559
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:03,631
[SPEAKER_15]: Army put out a game?

560
00:41:04,659 --> 00:41:13,686
[SPEAKER_15]: They put out a game on the PC a while back, um, to, it's, it's for the help, you know, them recruit more people, but, um, it's, it's just an online game.

561
00:41:13,826 --> 00:41:15,507
[SPEAKER_15]: It uses the Unreal Engine, I believe.

562
00:41:15,527 --> 00:41:17,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Dan said it was pretty cool, though.

563
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:22,232
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, he said Gradius V was really awesome.

564
00:41:24,577 --> 00:41:26,238
[SPEAKER_05]: and this is really yummy.

565
00:41:26,298 --> 00:41:29,020
[SPEAKER_15]: The chat room has some interesting things that they said that nobody said yet.

566
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,383
[SPEAKER_15]: Phantasy Star Online Episode 3, definitely.

567
00:41:33,363 --> 00:41:34,844
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to start playing PSO again.

568
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:37,286
[SPEAKER_15]: World of Warcraft and Starcraft Ghost.

569
00:41:39,087 --> 00:41:42,270
[SPEAKER_15]: Doom 3 is going to be horrible, says somebody.

570
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,231
[SPEAKER_15]: Doom 3 is going to be horrible.

571
00:41:46,852 --> 00:41:47,633
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh-oh, here goes Brad.

572
00:41:47,653 --> 00:41:49,034
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is Doom 3 going to be horrible?

573
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:49,535
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

574
00:41:49,595 --> 00:41:51,497
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the person doesn't like first-person shooters?

575
00:41:51,998 --> 00:41:52,418
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

576
00:41:52,438 --> 00:41:52,859
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.

577
00:41:52,959 --> 00:41:57,484
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't like first-person shooters, I don't expect you to like it, but as far as first-person shooters are concerned, it's going to be freaking great.

578
00:41:57,764 --> 00:41:59,085
[SPEAKER_00]: I've played the Alpha League.

579
00:42:00,186 --> 00:42:01,688
[SPEAKER_00]: It is incredible.

580
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:03,410
[SPEAKER_00]: It runs like shit on my computer, but it's great.

581
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:04,511
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the justification.

582
00:42:04,872 --> 00:42:07,174
[SPEAKER_15]: No multiplayer, and it's going to be completely linear.

583
00:42:07,995 --> 00:42:08,796
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Brad...

584
00:42:10,259 --> 00:42:13,701
[SPEAKER_00]: Then play Unreal Tournament or Quake 3.

585
00:42:13,761 --> 00:42:14,842
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what those are for.

586
00:42:15,422 --> 00:42:17,303
[SPEAKER_00]: They make Doom for online play.

587
00:42:17,343 --> 00:42:18,684
[SPEAKER_00]: They never did in the first place.

588
00:42:18,824 --> 00:42:22,987
[SPEAKER_14]: The reason why Doom 3 is going to be shitty is because they've spent too goddamn long on it.

589
00:42:24,287 --> 00:42:24,748
[SPEAKER_14]: I am 20.

590
00:42:26,689 --> 00:42:34,834
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember my friends showing me previews of this when they had, you know, like at conventions with movies of it when I was a sophomore in high school.

591
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:49,445
[SPEAKER_14]: It's, you know, it's kind of gotten outdated, you know, because when they had their brilliant engine back then and it looked gorgeous, now it looks like shit, and... It still does look gorgeous, and, I mean, that happens with a lot of games.

592
00:42:49,465 --> 00:42:52,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at Dragon Quest VII, Dragon Warrior VII.

593
00:42:52,368 --> 00:42:55,030
[SPEAKER_00]: That has been in the making for, like, what, five, six years?

594
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:56,531
[SPEAKER_00]: And it came out eventually.

595
00:42:57,412 --> 00:43:00,375
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it eventually came out here, and it's still a great game.

596
00:43:00,475 --> 00:43:03,778
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because it's dated-looking still doesn't mean it's not a good game.

597
00:43:05,424 --> 00:43:11,866
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually had an issue of Newtype where they had a review of Dragon Quest VII that was two years old.

598
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:21,909
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want them to do, like, another Secret of Mana using sprites.

599
00:43:22,549 --> 00:43:25,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, then again, we have Ragnarok, so what else do we need?

600
00:43:26,178 --> 00:43:44,446
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Sword of Mana, which I call it over here, it's the redo of the Seiken Densetsu game, the first one that was called Final Fantasy Adventure on Game Boy, which is a great game, you know, but this one looks, they updated it to make it look more like Seiken Densetsu 3, so, mmm, looks awesome.

601
00:43:44,486 --> 00:43:49,469
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I need is Seiken Densetsu 3 on my GBA, that'd make me happy.

602
00:43:49,829 --> 00:43:51,950
[SPEAKER_05]: All I need to do is just slap the ROM on there, there you go.

603
00:43:54,642 --> 00:44:00,656
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have the Flash Advance cards if you want to spend like $250 just for the little ROM cartridge and then you can load ROMs.

604
00:44:02,734 --> 00:44:07,418
[SPEAKER_00]: with a front loader program, or not front loader, a run-in program that'll emulate the ROMs for you.

605
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:17,708
[SPEAKER_15]: I heard something... That reminds me, some other hardware things I heard about from E3, they're gonna have something they're releasing for the GBA, where you can watch full motion video for like 30 minutes on a cartridge.

606
00:44:17,948 --> 00:44:24,474
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they have that already in Japan, you can get it from Lixang.com, but... I always giggle whenever I hear that website.

607
00:44:24,594 --> 00:44:27,117
[SPEAKER_00]: Lixang, sounds like something in an Asian porno.

608
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:44,028
[SPEAKER_05]: You know one thing I saw at Network yesterday was the Game Boy Advance player for the GameCube.

609
00:44:44,588 --> 00:44:45,549
[SPEAKER_15]: I want me one of those.

610
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:47,010
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty cool.

611
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:49,212
[SPEAKER_05]: It like sits on the bottom of those, kind of weird.

612
00:44:50,933 --> 00:44:53,995
[SPEAKER_15]: I think there's some comments wanting to be made in the corner that haven't been made yet.

613
00:44:54,315 --> 00:44:55,356
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie and I are whoring it.

614
00:44:55,536 --> 00:44:55,836
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.

615
00:44:57,284 --> 00:44:58,284
[SPEAKER_15]: Omega's trapped in the corner.

616
00:44:58,544 --> 00:45:09,628
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Brad, while we were still on that topic, and not trampling it flat, if you like your single-player, first-person, linear shooters, you can go to hell.

617
00:45:09,808 --> 00:45:10,328
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what?

618
00:45:10,588 --> 00:45:11,128
[SPEAKER_14]: I like them.

619
00:45:11,368 --> 00:45:12,048
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll join you.

620
00:45:13,949 --> 00:45:14,949
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I get it.

621
00:45:15,249 --> 00:45:16,810
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go to hell and you'll join me?

622
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:18,110
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your point?

623
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:19,651
[SPEAKER_00]: You like linear or you don't?

624
00:45:21,111 --> 00:45:23,912
[SPEAKER_00]: Ha ha, because Doom takes place in hell!

625
00:45:26,337 --> 00:45:27,358
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, nice recovery.

626
00:45:27,378 --> 00:45:29,339
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a geek, but I'm not that geeky, sorry.

627
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:37,426
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember being in college, right after graduation, going to my friend Marcy's house and playing Doom.

628
00:45:38,227 --> 00:45:39,788
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'd all be like, hurt me plenty!

629
00:45:40,048 --> 00:45:40,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Woo!

630
00:45:40,889 --> 00:45:41,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Thinking we were all badass.

631
00:45:43,195 --> 00:45:45,738
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we just thought we were awesome because we could play on Nightmare.

632
00:45:45,998 --> 00:45:53,225
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I hate to bring this up again, but why is it that I did not know, I swear I did not know any girls that played video games until after I was out of college.

633
00:45:53,385 --> 00:45:54,226
[SPEAKER_15]: Long after I was out of college.

634
00:45:54,246 --> 00:45:56,008
[SPEAKER_05]: I played video games all throughout when I was in high school.

635
00:45:56,028 --> 00:45:57,510
[SPEAKER_15]: How come I didn't have friends like you?

636
00:45:58,820 --> 00:45:59,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you suck.

637
00:46:02,043 --> 00:46:06,867
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I was just too preppy or something, and all my friends were in the band and cheerleading.

638
00:46:07,027 --> 00:46:08,208
[SPEAKER_05]: I worked in an arcade.

639
00:46:08,809 --> 00:46:10,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I was the only girl who played Tekken 3.

640
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,174
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Namco Arcade, so we had Tekken 3 before everybody else.

641
00:46:14,614 --> 00:46:17,656
[SPEAKER_15]: And weren't you known as the girl who played Tekken 3 who kicked all their asses?

642
00:46:45,086 --> 00:46:46,586
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is five years later.

643
00:46:46,666 --> 00:46:47,547
[SPEAKER_05]: No, four years later.

644
00:46:48,027 --> 00:46:48,727
[SPEAKER_13]: The legacy.

645
00:46:49,567 --> 00:46:51,228
[SPEAKER_13]: But the legend still burns.

646
00:46:52,528 --> 00:46:53,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, please.

647
00:46:55,189 --> 00:46:55,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone in there.

648
00:46:56,109 --> 00:47:05,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I went back to that cyber station, though, and, like, proceeded to... It's funny seeing all these people just sort of slapping at the Dance Maniacs machine and then I'm playing, like, you know, Miggle style.

649
00:47:05,712 --> 00:47:06,212
[SPEAKER_05]: It was funny.

650
00:47:06,953 --> 00:47:09,333
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, so, we got a bunch of girl gamers in the room.

651
00:47:09,353 --> 00:47:09,873
[SPEAKER_15]: That's cool.

652
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,714
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, how long have you been playing video games, Maren?

653
00:47:13,698 --> 00:47:15,200
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been playing video games since I was 10.

654
00:47:16,261 --> 00:47:21,766
[SPEAKER_16]: That's so cool.

655
00:47:22,347 --> 00:47:23,949
[SPEAKER_15]: What was the first video game you remember playing?

656
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:26,752
[SPEAKER_16]: Super Mario Bros.

657
00:47:27,092 --> 00:47:26,752
2.

658
00:47:28,093 --> 00:47:28,313
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

659
00:47:28,353 --> 00:47:29,735
[SPEAKER_16]: And then Legend of Zelda.

660
00:47:31,336 --> 00:47:31,757
[SPEAKER_15]: Very cool.

661
00:47:32,469 --> 00:47:33,570
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what my first one was?

662
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:33,950
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

663
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:36,472
[SPEAKER_05]: My first game was Pitfall.

664
00:47:37,273 --> 00:47:37,833
[SPEAKER_15]: On the Atari 2600?

665
00:47:37,894 --> 00:47:38,214
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh-huh.

666
00:47:38,754 --> 00:47:39,215
[SPEAKER_15]: I take that back.

667
00:47:39,255 --> 00:47:41,577
[SPEAKER_15]: My neighbors across the street were girls and they loved that game.

668
00:47:41,617 --> 00:47:42,377
[SPEAKER_15]: They made me play it.

669
00:47:42,718 --> 00:47:43,798
[SPEAKER_05]: And Kangaroo.

670
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,160
[SPEAKER_15]: Kangaroo was shitty.

671
00:47:46,381 --> 00:47:47,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, bite me.

672
00:47:47,101 --> 00:47:47,562
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

673
00:47:47,962 --> 00:47:53,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I played Kangaroo in an arcade at Godfather's Pizza.

674
00:47:53,587 --> 00:47:54,387
[SPEAKER_05]: So, ha.

675
00:47:55,188 --> 00:47:55,688
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm older.

676
00:47:56,189 --> 00:47:58,691
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember playing a brand new Donkey Kong machine.

677
00:47:59,815 --> 00:48:01,936
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember playing a cocktail machine as Batman.

678
00:48:01,956 --> 00:48:04,056
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, you I would expect to be playing Kongo Bongo.

679
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:05,317
[SPEAKER_05]: I never played it.

680
00:48:05,437 --> 00:48:07,237
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it's the Sega thing, but whatever.

681
00:48:07,617 --> 00:48:10,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I figured maybe you started... I played Space Fury and Gorp on my Clicca Vision.

682
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,119
[SPEAKER_15]: I was going to ask Angel, since she's a girl gamer too.

683
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,640
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah?

684
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,020
[SPEAKER_15]: First one you remember playing.

685
00:48:17,621 --> 00:48:18,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

686
00:48:18,821 --> 00:48:20,281
[SPEAKER_04]: It was either... Shit.

687
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:20,982
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it called?

688
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:22,402
[SPEAKER_04]: The damn computer one.

689
00:48:24,023 --> 00:48:25,303
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

690
00:48:26,618 --> 00:48:28,259
[SPEAKER_04]: I was born with a controller in my hand!

691
00:48:28,279 --> 00:48:29,719
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing games forever!

692
00:48:54,997 --> 00:48:59,418
[SPEAKER_14]: I was either like four or five and it was either Super Mario Brothers or Metroid.

693
00:48:59,438 --> 00:48:59,919
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't remember.

694
00:48:59,939 --> 00:49:01,179
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like at my neighbor's house.

695
00:49:01,979 --> 00:49:02,479
[SPEAKER_14]: It was cool.

696
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:05,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Then I got my Nintendo while I was in kindergarten and I was a freak from then on.

697
00:49:06,901 --> 00:49:07,261
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

698
00:49:07,561 --> 00:49:09,702
[SPEAKER_15]: I had a Nintendo jacket in the fourth grade.

699
00:49:09,942 --> 00:49:10,542
[SPEAKER_15]: I owned you.

700
00:49:10,602 --> 00:49:11,042
[SPEAKER_00]: Dork!

701
00:49:11,802 --> 00:49:14,203
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why the girls didn't talk to you.

702
00:49:14,443 --> 00:49:20,545
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not because... But, did you ever get a hold of Super Mario Brothers cereal?

703
00:49:21,945 --> 00:49:24,006
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Super Mario Brothers cereal was the shit.

704
00:49:24,981 --> 00:49:26,122
[SPEAKER_15]: What's going on?

705
00:49:26,162 --> 00:49:27,484
[SPEAKER_15]: Why is everybody yaying here?

706
00:49:29,986 --> 00:49:31,428
[SPEAKER_00]: Put Jamie on the mic.

707
00:49:31,448 --> 00:49:33,290
[SPEAKER_15]: Put Jamie on the mic and explain what they're eating.

708
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:34,471
[SPEAKER_05]: We're eating Dried Squid.

709
00:49:35,732 --> 00:49:35,952
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

710
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:39,136
[SPEAKER_15]: Back to the reminiscing.

711
00:49:40,305 --> 00:49:43,287
[SPEAKER_15]: Back to the reminiscing first video game ever topic, because I like this topic.

712
00:49:43,907 --> 00:49:52,152
[SPEAKER_15]: The first one I remember was at Chuck E. Cheese, back when they would have the room with the strobe light, and it was like, cool, you know, how 80s was this?

713
00:49:52,852 --> 00:49:56,814
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember being like three or four and playing Crystal Castles at Chuck E. Cheese.

714
00:49:56,875 --> 00:49:57,555
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god.

715
00:49:57,975 --> 00:49:59,336
[SPEAKER_15]: Crystal Castles was the shit.

716
00:49:59,356 --> 00:50:02,097
[SPEAKER_15]: When he dies, he goes, oh, no.

717
00:50:03,418 --> 00:50:05,020
[SPEAKER_15]: Or he goes, ouch.

718
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,501
[SPEAKER_15]: And then he flies away.

719
00:50:07,081 --> 00:50:09,163
[SPEAKER_15]: And see, it had that giant trackball thing.

720
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,605
[SPEAKER_15]: So one could say I was attracted to balls at a young age.

721
00:50:15,448 --> 00:50:17,089
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, God, we just lost half our listeners.

722
00:50:17,129 --> 00:50:17,569
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you know?

723
00:50:19,771 --> 00:50:20,692
[SPEAKER_15]: And gained some new ones.

724
00:50:21,532 --> 00:50:24,074
[SPEAKER_15]: Ew, it looks like... I'm not going to eat it.

725
00:50:24,114 --> 00:50:25,215
[SPEAKER_15]: It's gross looking.

726
00:50:26,396 --> 00:50:27,877
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me some squid.

727
00:50:28,778 --> 00:50:30,159
[SPEAKER_15]: It smells like punani.

728
00:50:30,379 --> 00:50:31,740
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to eat it live on the air.

729
00:50:32,301 --> 00:50:32,661
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

730
00:50:34,103 --> 00:50:37,307
[SPEAKER_15]: I think now is a good time to get into the... Wait, does anybody want to reminisce first games?

731
00:50:37,327 --> 00:50:38,187
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we didn't get to everybody.

732
00:50:38,228 --> 00:50:38,728
[SPEAKER_15]: Dark Tetsuya?

733
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:47,477
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know, you... Actually, it's kind of... It kind of reminds me of beef jerky.

734
00:50:49,248 --> 00:50:51,869
[SPEAKER_11]: My favorite is beef jerky.

735
00:50:52,029 --> 00:50:52,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, God, I don't know.

736
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:53,990
[SPEAKER_11]: Fast food, $2,600.

737
00:50:54,610 --> 00:51:00,052
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, was that the one where you're the little chef and, like, if you lost, then all the food would get thrown at you?

738
00:51:00,092 --> 00:51:01,573
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no.

739
00:51:02,033 --> 00:51:03,393
[SPEAKER_11]: Your little purple mouth thingy.

740
00:51:03,413 --> 00:51:04,894
[SPEAKER_11]: I know the game.

741
00:51:04,994 --> 00:51:06,855
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the game.

742
00:51:06,875 --> 00:51:07,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Tapping.

743
00:51:09,576 --> 00:51:09,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

744
00:51:09,736 --> 00:51:10,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, Rob.

745
00:51:10,556 --> 00:51:10,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Dang.

746
00:51:10,916 --> 00:51:13,757
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob, did you shoot what he did?

747
00:51:13,797 --> 00:51:15,398
[SPEAKER_15]: You just got me and Brad confused, didn't you?

748
00:51:15,418 --> 00:51:15,458
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

749
00:51:15,478 --> 00:51:16,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Because everybody does that.

750
00:51:16,338 --> 00:51:17,579
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I said, Rob, did you shoot what he did?

751
00:51:17,739 --> 00:51:18,139
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, what'd he do?

752
00:51:21,181 --> 00:51:22,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Watch out, I don't know if there's some pussy at you.

753
00:51:26,467 --> 00:51:29,871
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, let's finish up the others in the room.

754
00:51:30,072 --> 00:51:31,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Eat the squid.

755
00:51:31,253 --> 00:51:33,796
[SPEAKER_15]: Fine, I'll eat the squid, but you've got to give the mic to Angel and the others so they can finish.

756
00:51:33,816 --> 00:51:35,758
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to eat the squid before I do that.

757
00:51:35,799 --> 00:51:36,840
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks nasty.

758
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:37,921
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what it looks like?

759
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:38,942
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks like Big League Chew.

760
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:51,681
[SPEAKER_15]: This is horrible radio.

761
00:51:55,184 --> 00:51:56,325
[SPEAKER_15]: This is horrible radio.

762
00:51:56,365 --> 00:51:58,047
[SPEAKER_15]: Give the mic to somebody in the back.

763
00:51:59,949 --> 00:52:00,669
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep, leave.

764
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:02,591
[SPEAKER_15]: Magus, first game.

765
00:52:06,474 --> 00:52:07,876
[SPEAKER_13]: Words cannot express.

766
00:52:12,339 --> 00:52:15,062
[SPEAKER_13]: Words cannot express what Rob is going through right now.

767
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:19,549
[SPEAKER_13]: This is bad radio, tell me your first game.

768
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:23,190
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, it tastes like burning.

769
00:52:25,111 --> 00:52:26,331
[SPEAKER_15]: Burnination, yes.

770
00:52:28,251 --> 00:52:36,233
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm probably the youngest here, but I still remember playing Kangaroo when I was three, and then moving on to Burger Time when I was five.

771
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:41,754
[SPEAKER_15]: Then it was Duck Hunt, and then it's all downhill from there.

772
00:52:44,335 --> 00:52:44,475
[SPEAKER_00]: And...

773
00:52:45,911 --> 00:52:48,313
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, did you get to reminisce about your first video game you remember?

774
00:52:49,174 --> 00:52:50,094
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I didn't.

775
00:52:50,855 --> 00:52:59,922
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see, the first game I remember... I don't know, I just had like 70 games on the ColecoVision, so I used to play them all.

776
00:52:59,982 --> 00:53:04,986
[SPEAKER_15]: I used to have this one that was Bumba Jump, that's one of my favorites.

777
00:53:05,346 --> 00:53:07,407
[SPEAKER_15]: There is this other one, what was it?

778
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:10,450
[SPEAKER_15]: Frenzy, I used to like Frenzy.

779
00:53:11,891 --> 00:53:12,812
[SPEAKER_15]: Tester's Revenge?

780
00:53:13,252 --> 00:53:13,352
[SPEAKER_15]: Um...

781
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:33,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see, um, Smurfs, I used to love the Smurfs game, because that was easy, and I used to make, I used to love to make the Smurfs fall, because they're stupid, and, um, what else, um, there was this one that, I can't remember.

782
00:53:33,323 --> 00:53:35,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a Tragball.

783
00:53:35,063 --> 00:53:39,146
[SPEAKER_15]: But, but yeah, pretty much, pretty much just, uh, Frenzy was cool.

784
00:53:39,566 --> 00:53:41,867
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, ooh, ooh, Jumpman.

785
00:53:42,687 --> 00:53:43,668
[SPEAKER_15]: I love Jumpman.

786
00:53:44,568 --> 00:53:45,689
[SPEAKER_15]: Jumpman was awesome.

787
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,071
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Rob?

788
00:53:48,532 --> 00:53:48,772
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes?

789
00:53:49,933 --> 00:53:55,357
[SPEAKER_15]: Now that you've had squid, do you feel like... Okay, I'm going to share this real fast, and we're going to get into the FUs of the week.

790
00:53:56,418 --> 00:53:58,120
[SPEAKER_15]: I've had, what is it, calamari?

791
00:53:59,161 --> 00:54:00,542
[SPEAKER_15]: I love calamari, it's good.

792
00:54:00,742 --> 00:54:01,623
[SPEAKER_15]: That, not good.

793
00:54:02,624 --> 00:54:04,265
[SPEAKER_15]: That's like beef jerky, but it's squid.

794
00:54:04,465 --> 00:54:09,569
[SPEAKER_15]: How can you, I'm just watching Maren, and she's just like, nope, nope, she's just eating it, mmm, this is good shit.

795
00:54:09,589 --> 00:54:10,090
[SPEAKER_15]: It's nasty!

796
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:11,091
[SPEAKER_15]: It's nasty!

797
00:54:12,428 --> 00:54:15,651
[SPEAKER_16]: Mmm, beefy, but more like squiddy.

798
00:54:18,493 --> 00:54:21,395
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm expecting it to like explode in my mouth or something.

799
00:54:21,475 --> 00:54:25,418
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, I'm glad nobody caught that.

800
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:34,185
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, let's settle down children because it's time for Jamie to burninate with the FUs of the week.

801
00:54:37,327 --> 00:54:39,789
[SPEAKER_15]: But the soul still burninates.

802
00:54:41,078 --> 00:54:42,739
[SPEAKER_05]: My mouth is full of squid.

803
00:54:43,019 --> 00:54:43,919
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, you ready, Jamie?

804
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:44,539
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

805
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,761
[SPEAKER_15]: Since it's our season premiere, we should remind the listeners what the FUs of the week are all about.

806
00:54:50,562 --> 00:54:53,383
[SPEAKER_05]: It's where we take all the shit that pisses us off and say, fuck you.

807
00:54:54,023 --> 00:54:54,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

808
00:54:54,683 --> 00:54:55,264
[SPEAKER_05]: How was that?

809
00:54:55,644 --> 00:55:00,866
[SPEAKER_15]: The chat room is begging and pleading us to keep it under control this week and not go on for an hour, so...

810
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:05,972
[SPEAKER_15]: So, let's try and regulate ourselves, boys and girls.

811
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:09,794
[SPEAKER_15]: If you hesitate, if you hesitate too much on your FUs, the mic goes on the next person.

812
00:55:10,074 --> 00:55:10,334
[SPEAKER_15]: Agreed?

813
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:10,734
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

814
00:55:11,115 --> 00:55:11,475
[SPEAKER_15]: Here we go.

815
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:12,756
[SPEAKER_15]: Here we go.

816
00:55:29,246 --> 00:55:31,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, my thank you of the week goes to Rob.

817
00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:39,125
[SPEAKER_05]: for parking really shitty and me having to squeeze my perfectly turning radius-ish car around to get in.

818
00:55:40,146 --> 00:55:42,067
[SPEAKER_05]: My car has this killer turning radius.

819
00:55:42,828 --> 00:55:45,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Another fuck you that we give to Julie's car for stinking.

820
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:48,893
[SPEAKER_15]: It would make you more proud to know that I was talking on my cell phone when I parked.

821
00:55:51,255 --> 00:55:56,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Another fuck you gives to Julie's car for smelling like dust and rotten milk and for having no working air conditioning.

822
00:55:57,239 --> 00:55:58,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Or a radio that lets us change the station.

823
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:00,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Or a rearview mirror.

824
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:01,657
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had a rearview mirror.

825
00:56:01,717 --> 00:56:02,497
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a side mirror.

826
00:56:02,958 --> 00:56:03,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Side mirror.

827
00:56:03,878 --> 00:56:05,199
[SPEAKER_05]: The passenger side side mirror.

828
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:08,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you goes toward getting lost in San Francisco.

829
00:56:08,542 --> 00:56:11,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, just toward the whole street system in San Francisco.

830
00:56:13,206 --> 00:56:19,071
[SPEAKER_05]: And then toward, like, you know, not being able to get Final Fantasy X-2 at Network Video.

831
00:56:20,052 --> 00:56:24,095
[SPEAKER_05]: And also toward the city of Milpitas for being weird.

832
00:56:24,591 --> 00:56:31,116
[SPEAKER_05]: for having like one entrance off of 101 and another one off of 680 and having me turn around and have a snap.

833
00:56:32,276 --> 00:56:36,860
[SPEAKER_05]: And then another one goes toward, um, stuff.

834
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:37,680
[SPEAKER_05]: The end.

835
00:56:39,481 --> 00:56:41,143
[SPEAKER_05]: And another, that's my hiccup.

836
00:56:42,944 --> 00:56:44,205
[SPEAKER_05]: They're burpy hiccups, they hurt.

837
00:56:44,665 --> 00:56:45,546
[SPEAKER_15]: Ew, are you burping?

838
00:56:47,947 --> 00:56:48,468
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

839
00:56:49,789 --> 00:56:50,269
[SPEAKER_15]: That's it then?

840
00:56:53,108 --> 00:57:00,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Triscuit for giving you the phantom taste of cheese, but not really being cheese

841
00:57:07,276 --> 00:57:31,507
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, starting with this weekend, uh, or last weekend, um, fuck you to San Francisco, I hate you and your stupid town, it smells like ass, and they have birds that shit on my head, and I don't like that, and, um, the fact that you pretty much, I hate Pier 39, Pier 39 is a waste of time, it's just like expensive shit, and how many stores do you really need of souvenirs for San Francisco?

842
00:57:32,087 --> 00:57:35,169
[SPEAKER_15]: I can go to any store there and buy the same shit, it really sucks.

843
00:57:35,809 --> 00:57:43,933
[SPEAKER_15]: So, after that, after you do my freaking cold, because, you know, I hate being sick, and all I smell is snot.

844
00:57:44,013 --> 00:57:46,974
[SPEAKER_15]: I've smelled snot for about four days now, and that's all I smell.

845
00:57:46,994 --> 00:57:49,135
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like this nasty ammonia smell.

846
00:57:49,715 --> 00:57:52,717
[SPEAKER_15]: All day long, that's all I smell is goddamn snot.

847
00:57:53,217 --> 00:57:53,677
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay?

848
00:57:54,517 --> 00:58:01,901
[SPEAKER_15]: After you do this stupid British chick that's performing up on the, like, uh... On the water stage, whatever that stupid stage was there...

849
00:58:04,611 --> 00:58:26,234
[SPEAKER_15]: She was freaking stupid, her and her like gypsy child, I mean, freaking doing these acts up there, and people just didn't give a shit, they're just sitting there going, okay, what's the next thing on, what's the next thing on, and then people are yelling for her to get off the stage, and she's like, oh, how do you like, oh, kids, you know, clap your whistle, and it's just, it was annoying, it was god awful.

850
00:58:27,916 --> 00:58:41,982
[SPEAKER_15]: F you to the refrigerator for having a stupid plug in the bottom there and water being there and I didn't know what the plug was for so I didn't want the water in the refrigerator so I pulled the plug not thinking that the plug doesn't go anywhere except down to the floor.

851
00:58:42,614 --> 00:58:47,077
[SPEAKER_15]: and so now the floor's flooded with water from the stupid refrigerator and that sucks.

852
00:58:48,018 --> 00:58:51,640
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, F you to B3 for not giving me a freaking badge.

853
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,783
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, goddammit, I fucking set up a bunch of shit for you guys.

854
00:58:56,163 --> 00:59:00,166
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, the whole, like, you know, feed for that stupid camera and all that shit.

855
00:59:00,206 --> 00:59:01,707
[SPEAKER_15]: I got the damn Cat5 cable.

856
00:59:01,787 --> 00:59:06,630
[SPEAKER_15]: I had to spend my own goddamn money to buy 50 feet of Cat5 I'm never gonna ever use again.

857
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:09,692
[SPEAKER_15]: And, goddammit, you couldn't even give me a fucking badge?

858
00:59:10,032 --> 00:59:11,173
[SPEAKER_15]: What is wrong with you people?

859
00:59:11,873 --> 00:59:40,505
[SPEAKER_15]: and seriously, and after that, oh, give me a free t-shirt, yeah, sure, I really saw that one, I had to go buy my goddamn t-shirt, I don't give a shit, whatever, so, that was awful, I had to carry my goddamn stuff two blocks to your goddamn freaking arcade, which sucked, because that overpriced shit, all your games sucked, your stupid time crisis games sucked, your stupid fucking, um, god, I can't remember, it's some stupid gun game that the goddamn thing wasn't calibrated, right, I'm firing off the screen and saying dead center,

860
00:59:41,939 --> 00:59:45,882
[SPEAKER_05]: That was, uh... Yeah, House of the Dead, because I wanted to play that.

861
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:47,703
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, House of the Dead fucking sucks.

862
00:59:47,823 --> 00:59:49,804
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, though, your initial game machine was the shit.

863
00:59:51,325 --> 00:59:53,246
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, but everything else was shit, okay?

864
00:59:53,446 --> 00:59:57,449
[SPEAKER_15]: What was that goddamn huge... The rollercoaster machine was the shit.

865
00:59:58,769 --> 00:59:59,610
[SPEAKER_15]: And what the hell is that?

866
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:04,393
[SPEAKER_15]: We're having, like, a stupid shooting range right next to where we're freaking performing for freaking DDR.

867
01:00:04,693 --> 01:00:05,774
[SPEAKER_15]: So every now and then you hear this...

868
01:00:07,723 --> 01:00:09,586
[SPEAKER_15]: And people are like, what the hell is that screaming noise?

869
01:00:10,027 --> 01:00:10,548
[SPEAKER_15]: That sucks.

870
01:00:11,469 --> 01:00:16,657
[SPEAKER_15]: And finally, the biggest one of them all, the biggest FD of the week, is going to PayPal.

871
01:00:17,458 --> 01:00:21,003
[SPEAKER_15]: PayPal overcharged my account by 600 fucking dollars.

872
01:00:21,747 --> 01:00:24,029
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, beware of PayPal.

873
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:26,972
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to pay for an auction that was $5.99 plus $4.25 shipping for a grand total of $10.24.

874
01:00:27,012 --> 01:00:27,373
[SPEAKER_15]: What did I get?

875
01:00:27,393 --> 01:00:27,753
[SPEAKER_15]: I had it.

876
01:00:27,773 --> 01:00:30,436
[SPEAKER_15]: It instead charged me $599 and $4.25 shipping for a grand total of $6.03.25.

877
01:00:42,298 --> 01:00:56,389
[SPEAKER_15]: There's nothing that PayPal can do, so I had to end up contacting my guy, which made my account overdraft, which also caused a bunch of my other auctions to, you know, overdraft my account even more, so now I have to pay finance charges of about $180.

878
01:00:56,529 --> 01:01:00,132
[SPEAKER_15]: Plus, I had to come up with rent money.

879
01:01:00,732 --> 01:01:03,795
[SPEAKER_15]: So I had to sell off my DVD collection to fix that.

880
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:06,957
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, PayPal, for ruining my whole fucking week.

881
01:01:08,638 --> 01:01:08,938
[SPEAKER_15]: The end.

882
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,141
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow, how can I follow that?

883
01:01:14,889 --> 01:01:19,912
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see, my FU of the week goes to being sick on a weekend.

884
01:01:20,253 --> 01:01:22,094
[SPEAKER_15]: Being sick on a weekday, that's okay.

885
01:01:22,874 --> 01:01:23,394
[SPEAKER_15]: That's okay.

886
01:01:23,415 --> 01:01:27,237
[SPEAKER_15]: My FU goes to Loki for giving me SARS in the first place because he was sick and now I'm sick.

887
01:01:29,038 --> 01:01:32,280
[SPEAKER_15]: And the thing is, if you're sick on a weekday, that's cool because you can miss work.

888
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:40,585
[SPEAKER_15]: But being sick on a weekend, that just sucks because now you have to work and you have to waste your weekend lying in bed going, I hate my life and I want to die.

889
01:01:41,826 --> 01:01:42,026
[SPEAKER_15]: But...

890
01:01:42,938 --> 01:01:44,339
[SPEAKER_15]: I do have a good point out of all this.

891
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:48,021
[SPEAKER_15]: Coldies, whoever invented coldies, pure fucking genius.

892
01:01:48,302 --> 01:01:51,704
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm already on the other end of my cold and I was never like super duper ill.

893
01:01:51,964 --> 01:01:54,826
[SPEAKER_15]: Coldies are the bomb and I recommend everybody take them.

894
01:01:55,126 --> 01:02:00,329
[SPEAKER_05]: You should have been listening to me from day one because I've always told you just take zinc and vitamin C and you'll feel better.

895
01:02:00,369 --> 01:02:01,750
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly what's in that shit.

896
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:05,332
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I know.

897
01:02:05,633 --> 01:02:08,975
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's called coldies and it tastes like cherries.

898
01:02:13,114 --> 01:02:14,334
[SPEAKER_15]: No, they do taste like butt.

899
01:02:14,394 --> 01:02:14,835
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll agree.

900
01:02:15,075 --> 01:02:18,777
[SPEAKER_05]: It tastes like the shitty rear end of a SARS victim.

901
01:02:20,118 --> 01:02:21,879
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, F you to the taste of coldies.

902
01:02:22,019 --> 01:02:22,579
[SPEAKER_15]: That's awful.

903
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:26,882
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, let's move on to the other folks in the room.

904
01:02:27,002 --> 01:02:28,503
[SPEAKER_15]: Starting off with Marin.

905
01:02:29,586 --> 01:02:35,553
[SPEAKER_16]: I would like to say F you to my car, since the alternator exploded or something and we had to replace it.

906
01:02:36,154 --> 01:02:40,779
[SPEAKER_16]: F you to McCarran International Airport for making me take off my shoes so they could x-ray them.

907
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:45,825
[SPEAKER_16]: And F you to guys who step on your feet and do not apologize and are rude.

908
01:02:46,766 --> 01:02:47,426
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's about it.

909
01:02:47,687 --> 01:02:48,708
[SPEAKER_16]: Other than that, it was a good week.

910
01:02:49,406 --> 01:02:54,169
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, and then guys who step on your feet and smell bad and can't work the soft-serve ice cream machine.

911
01:02:54,189 --> 01:02:55,330
[SPEAKER_16]: So, yeah.

912
01:02:55,951 --> 01:02:56,591
[SPEAKER_15]: So insensitive.

913
01:02:57,512 --> 01:02:58,272
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, let's move on.

914
01:02:58,332 --> 01:03:00,214
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm gonna move on and get Brad to go here.

915
01:03:02,095 --> 01:03:02,515
[SPEAKER_15]: Here.

916
01:03:02,656 --> 01:03:04,457
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this my song?

917
01:03:04,477 --> 01:03:06,358
[SPEAKER_00]: You always give me this.

918
01:03:06,418 --> 01:03:08,019
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different song every week.

919
01:03:08,059 --> 01:03:08,480
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, anyway.

920
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:17,526
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he goes to Sailors, because, um, I mean, I love Irene's dad and all, but, uh, he wanted to play, he's from, he was in the Navy, you know, he's retired.

921
01:03:17,566 --> 01:03:17,646
[SPEAKER_00]: He...

922
01:03:19,142 --> 01:03:24,005
[SPEAKER_00]: He played, we had to do a drinking game, sailor style, like sailor rules.

923
01:03:24,085 --> 01:03:27,127
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had 60 seconds to drink your shot.

924
01:03:27,287 --> 01:03:29,148
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went in a round of three people.

925
01:03:29,508 --> 01:03:34,351
[SPEAKER_00]: And I probably had somewhere around 11 or 12 shots of rum last night.

926
01:03:34,371 --> 01:03:36,692
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't get sobered up until about 2 p.m.

927
01:03:36,712 --> 01:03:37,052
[SPEAKER_00]: today.

928
01:03:38,253 --> 01:03:40,875
[SPEAKER_00]: So, sailor style.

929
01:03:43,716 --> 01:03:43,976
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

930
01:03:44,817 --> 01:03:45,357
[SPEAKER_11]: Dead air.

931
01:03:45,377 --> 01:03:46,038
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

932
01:03:47,138 --> 01:03:47,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike.

933
01:03:48,999 --> 01:03:50,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, okay, my F.U.

934
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:54,940
[SPEAKER_11]: goes to not having that stupid DWI finish I wanted on the Season 3 premiere.

935
01:03:56,380 --> 01:03:57,861
[SPEAKER_11]: I was hoping to have it finished by then.

936
01:03:59,601 --> 01:04:03,882
[SPEAKER_11]: And F. not being able to sleep, because I had nowhere to sleep, but that was probably my fault.

937
01:04:03,902 --> 01:04:05,102
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, F.U.

938
01:04:05,142 --> 01:04:05,822
[SPEAKER_11]: to myself.

939
01:04:07,782 --> 01:04:09,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

940
01:04:09,923 --> 01:04:10,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Angel!

941
01:04:10,683 --> 01:04:12,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I'd like to say F.U.

942
01:04:12,443 --> 01:04:14,923
[SPEAKER_04]: to my boss again, because he almost didn't give me the weekend off.

943
01:04:15,724 --> 01:04:15,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Ow.

944
01:04:16,624 --> 01:04:17,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I gave him that flash.

945
01:04:20,415 --> 01:04:21,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel the flash.

946
01:04:21,216 --> 01:04:22,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, okay.

947
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I almost didn't get to come here.

948
01:04:27,201 --> 01:04:27,441
[SPEAKER_04]: See?

949
01:04:27,581 --> 01:04:28,242
[SPEAKER_04]: That wasn't good.

950
01:04:28,642 --> 01:04:29,563
[SPEAKER_04]: So, FU to that.

951
01:04:31,105 --> 01:04:32,586
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, moving on to Magus.

952
01:04:33,227 --> 01:04:38,071
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, first of all, FU to the Sacramento RT bus system.

953
01:04:38,752 --> 01:04:40,814
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't know how to run their buses around Arden.

954
01:04:41,314 --> 01:04:44,157
[SPEAKER_13]: We were trying to get from my high school...

955
01:04:45,057 --> 01:04:48,739
[SPEAKER_15]: to Arden Fur Mall to go see, like, Matrix 3 Loads and stuff.

956
01:04:49,959 --> 01:04:57,543
[SPEAKER_15]: Apparently, we make it to the light rail station and, well, the bus doesn't show for an hour and a half.

957
01:04:58,503 --> 01:05:06,687
[SPEAKER_01]: So we took the long walk from Arden Fulton to the mall in the burning heat.

958
01:05:08,207 --> 01:05:10,728
[SPEAKER_15]: Second of all, yes, yes.

959
01:05:10,808 --> 01:05:13,469
[SPEAKER_15]: Make sure you want to fly the McViper.

960
01:05:13,489 --> 01:05:13,530
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh...

961
01:05:15,316 --> 01:05:17,617
[SPEAKER_15]: Second of all, F you to traffic on Thursday.

962
01:05:17,957 --> 01:05:18,577
[SPEAKER_15]: What the hell?

963
01:05:18,917 --> 01:05:23,418
[SPEAKER_15]: We leave on Thursday right before Memorial Day weekend.

964
01:05:23,658 --> 01:05:25,219
[SPEAKER_15]: We expect no one to be on the road.

965
01:05:25,579 --> 01:05:27,960
[SPEAKER_15]: We're an hour and a half late coming into the Bay Area.

966
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:31,501
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck those stupid drivers.

967
01:05:32,101 --> 01:05:34,581
[SPEAKER_15]: When again, we were one of the stupid drivers.

968
01:05:36,102 --> 01:05:36,382
[SPEAKER_15]: Next.

969
01:05:38,843 --> 01:05:43,304
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to Chinese food places that play Outbreak while you're trying to eat.

970
01:05:45,134 --> 01:05:45,954
[SPEAKER_15]: That's kind of funny.

971
01:05:46,794 --> 01:05:48,055
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if I give an FU, that's funny.

972
01:05:48,315 --> 01:05:50,875
[SPEAKER_15]: A Chinese movie plays, it plays Outbreak, the movie Outbreak.

973
01:05:50,895 --> 01:05:54,156
[SPEAKER_04]: It happened to be, it happened to be Silver Garden, thank you very much.

974
01:05:55,737 --> 01:05:58,037
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, does Navi have any FUs of the week?

975
01:05:58,697 --> 01:05:58,877
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

976
01:06:00,298 --> 01:06:01,438
[SPEAKER_15]: Somebody, somebody's nice.

977
01:06:03,118 --> 01:06:04,839
[SPEAKER_15]: Somebody's in a happy mood and has no FUs of the week.

978
01:06:09,713 --> 01:06:11,334
[SPEAKER_15]: He says he forgot them because they were fucked up.

979
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:14,937
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, so that's it for the studio FUs of the week.

980
01:06:15,117 --> 01:06:15,617
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, not bad.

[SPEAKER_15]: Oh wait, does Nelly have anything?

982
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,221
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, oh, she's not that bitter.

983
01:06:20,281 --> 01:06:20,521
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

992
01:07:09,201 --> 01:07:10,642

993
01:07:11,663 --> 01:07:12,243
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't be gay.

994
01:07:12,724 --> 01:07:13,484
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't be gay, Sparky.

999
01:07:24,853 --> 01:07:29,237
[SPEAKER_15]: Because the comment you made and Jamie coughing made me spit soda slash hot dog out of my mouth.

1000
01:07:34,204 --> 01:07:36,066
[SPEAKER_15]: And now we just had a laugh at your expense.

1001
01:07:38,047 --> 01:07:38,968
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the win.

01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:41,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep going.

01:07:42,551 --> 01:07:46,975

1005
01:08:08,590 --> 01:08:12,973
[SPEAKER_15]: People who don't like Matrix Reloaded, they had to think somewhat, because they had to think somewhat.

1006
01:08:13,633 --> 01:08:16,435
[SPEAKER_15]: And to close it off, my 56k connection to my ISP should die.

1027
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:17,154
[SPEAKER_15]: Riding a bike across town in 95 degree heat is not fun.

1028
01:09:17,775 --> 01:09:23,517
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck the holiday for keeping the dining halls closed an extra day so I can't eat a decent meal a day longer than usual.

1029
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:25,009
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura.com

1030
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:30,981
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1031
01:09:31,962 --> 01:09:32,662
[SPEAKER_15]: Moving on.

1032
01:09:33,083 --> 01:09:37,826
[SPEAKER_15]: John Fields would like to say, F you Sony for making the PS2 with such cheap parts.

1033
01:09:38,246 --> 01:09:39,748
[SPEAKER_15]: Discreet error, discreet error.

1034
01:09:39,768 --> 01:09:44,831
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so freaking tired of turning my PlayStation 2 upside down and spinning it all around to get it to read the disc.

1035
01:09:45,272 --> 01:09:56,520
[SPEAKER_15]: Also F you to server ops to take their job way too seriously and let nothing go by and then lying about giving warnings and thus ban someone without them realizing what they were doing was wrong despite of how insignificant the problem was.

1036
01:10:00,421 --> 01:10:02,142
[SPEAKER_15]: Vandalus would like to say an F you.

1037
01:10:03,463 --> 01:10:06,245
[SPEAKER_15]: F you to my Cadillac for having a leaky radiator.

1038
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:17,273
[SPEAKER_15]: Arcadian42 would like to say fuck you to the person who strayed to my rear car door in the Scandia parking lot and dented it in slightly.

1039
01:10:17,873 --> 01:10:20,395
[SPEAKER_15]: Now the window of that door won't go down all the way anymore.

1040
01:10:20,535 --> 01:10:21,776
[SPEAKER_15]: Fucking hit and run bitches.

1041
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:39,182
[SPEAKER_15]: and lastly, Muheimer would like to say, fuck me for not being here and submitting late, fuck not having the internet for two weeks because of McGathey Firewall, fuck homophobes, but yay for 50 cent DDR extreme 10 minutes away finally, oh, and thank God for acupuncture curing my allergies.

1042
01:10:39,882 --> 01:10:40,323
[SPEAKER_15]: Allergies.

1043
01:10:42,344 --> 01:10:44,085
[SPEAKER_15]: Hooray, that's everybody's FU of the week.

1044
01:10:46,567 --> 01:10:49,689
[SPEAKER_15]: So, any last bits of bitterness?

1045
01:10:51,331 --> 01:10:51,671
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki,

1046
01:10:52,654 --> 01:10:55,696
[SPEAKER_15]: You have something new that's going to be coming to the show that I see you just got.

1047
01:10:55,876 --> 01:10:58,137
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you want to share with our listeners what you just won?

1048
01:10:59,918 --> 01:11:05,601
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I actually found this when I was looking for Dansense Revolution stuff.

1049
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:10,724
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, normally I look for the arcade discs and stuff, and this just happened to be pulled up in an eBay auction.

1050
01:11:11,465 --> 01:11:16,047
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I won a hentai cosplay.

1051
01:11:16,107 --> 01:11:20,710
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, it's a cosplay porn featuring DDR characters.

1052
01:11:24,702 --> 01:11:27,083
[SPEAKER_15]: So yes, we have DDR porn.

1053
01:11:28,544 --> 01:11:29,765
[SPEAKER_15]: Will we get to play that on the show?

1054
01:11:31,306 --> 01:11:31,686
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course.

1055
01:11:31,966 --> 01:11:32,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay!

1056
01:11:33,227 --> 01:11:33,727
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yay.

1057
01:11:35,288 --> 01:11:36,368
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't sound too excited, Jamie.

1058
01:11:36,728 --> 01:11:38,249
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm actually kind of curious.

1059
01:11:38,569 --> 01:11:40,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it going to be like Final Fuck X?

1060
01:11:40,491 --> 01:11:42,992
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope it's not all blurred out and shit.

1061
01:11:44,092 --> 01:11:46,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Will there be pantsless rage?

1062
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:50,636
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll be just like Final Fuck X. Where did my afghan go?

1063
01:11:52,554 --> 01:11:53,214
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I'm curious.

1064
01:11:53,554 --> 01:11:54,155
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like disappeared.

1065
01:11:54,235 --> 01:11:54,715
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, there it is.

1066
01:11:56,616 --> 01:11:57,856
[SPEAKER_05]: It ran away from all the people.

1067
01:12:00,317 --> 01:12:04,979
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, I like these chairs because I can sit really, you know, sideways in them.

1068
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:09,940
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, we're going to take a quick break.

1069
01:12:10,481 --> 01:12:12,802
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're going to come back and do the cage match in a little bit.

1070
01:12:13,442 --> 01:12:18,564
[SPEAKER_15]: But first we're going to hear some Kylie from the Euro Mega Mix.

1071
01:12:19,224 --> 01:12:21,745
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we'll hear something from Poppin' Music.

1072
01:12:24,291 --> 01:12:26,156
[SPEAKER_15]: and last message because Jamie wants to hear it.

1073
01:12:26,236 --> 01:12:28,221
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll be right back, boys and girls.

1074
01:12:28,262 --> 01:12:29,705
[SPEAKER_15]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1075
01:13:03,558 --> 01:13:07,881
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

1076
01:13:43,716 --> 01:13:49,259
I wish to the arrest of your foe, may he make your message a thousand times

1077
01:14:45,419 --> 01:14:46,680
Thank you for watching!

1078
01:15:13,254 --> 01:15:13,875
Thanks for watching!

1079
01:18:29,458 --> 01:18:30,679
[SPEAKER_15]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1080
01:18:31,019 --> 01:18:33,181
[SPEAKER_15]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

1081
01:18:35,082 --> 01:18:41,266
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1082
01:18:42,627 --> 01:18:51,332
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're just a few minutes... We're just a few minutes out from this season three's very first cage match, which should be an exciting one.

1083
01:18:51,352 --> 01:18:54,174
[SPEAKER_15]: I've seen all the songs, and I think... I picked Crab.

1084
01:18:54,574 --> 01:18:56,896
[SPEAKER_15]: I think... No, actually, your pick is pretty... Well, we'll see...

1085
01:18:57,822 --> 01:18:59,863
[SPEAKER_15]: You'll see what the songs are going to be in a little bit.

1086
01:19:01,545 --> 01:19:03,486
[SPEAKER_15]: But they're all pretty good.

1087
01:19:03,526 --> 01:19:05,647
[SPEAKER_15]: I know which songs, I've heard all these songs, they're all pretty good.

1088
01:19:05,667 --> 01:19:07,709
[SPEAKER_15]: They're all the kind of music that our chat room seems to like.

1089
01:19:07,789 --> 01:19:11,251
[SPEAKER_15]: So those of you that yell at us for picking crap, I have nothing to complain about this week.

1090
01:19:11,411 --> 01:19:12,392
[SPEAKER_05]: They said it picks show tunes.

1091
01:19:16,207 --> 01:19:18,249
[SPEAKER_15]: Masquerade, Paper Faces, I'm very... Okay, wait.

1092
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:23,813
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought I'd open the floor up for story time because I know a lot of people had stories they wanted to tell tonight.

1093
01:19:23,893 --> 01:19:26,656
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Jamie, will you want to kick it off?

1094
01:19:26,676 --> 01:19:30,859
[SPEAKER_15]: Why don't you tell us about how you've been burninating this weekend with Marin.

1095
01:19:31,119 --> 01:19:32,100
[SPEAKER_15]: Or does Marin want to tell the story?

1096
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:32,400
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

1097
01:19:34,462 --> 01:19:37,184
[SPEAKER_05]: It starts off with me at work at 5.30 in the morning.

1098
01:19:38,085 --> 01:19:39,186
[SPEAKER_15]: Do I need story time music?

1099
01:19:39,206 --> 01:19:40,347
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you want story time music?

1100
01:19:40,367 --> 01:19:40,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1101
01:19:40,607 --> 01:19:41,728
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Sal-kun.

1102
01:19:44,569 --> 01:19:49,713
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah, I have to play the music that came to us from the Hamster Alliance.

1103
01:19:49,853 --> 01:19:51,374
[SPEAKER_15]: Because Loki liked it.

1104
01:19:51,534 --> 01:19:52,675
[SPEAKER_15]: Which, I don't remember which one it is.

1105
01:19:53,375 --> 01:19:54,115
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's this one.

1106
01:19:57,378 --> 01:19:57,598
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1107
01:19:58,158 --> 01:19:59,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob, do you have any cookies?

1108
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:00,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have what?

1109
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:01,901
[SPEAKER_05]: I need cookies to tell a story.

1110
01:20:03,822 --> 01:20:04,522
[SPEAKER_15]: Just tell your story.

1111
01:20:07,444 --> 01:20:10,726
[SPEAKER_05]: I get off work, and I go right over to Jessica's house.

1112
01:20:12,427 --> 01:20:12,988
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's...

1113
01:20:14,483 --> 01:20:19,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody waiting for me there, sitting on the couch, which is still set up theater-style seating for watching movies on the wall.

1114
01:20:21,206 --> 01:20:26,008
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we went, and what did we do?

1115
01:20:26,048 --> 01:20:27,769
[SPEAKER_05]: We went out to South Sac for boba.

1116
01:20:28,789 --> 01:20:30,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we went to Roseville for sushi.

1117
01:20:31,771 --> 01:20:35,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we went back to my house and decided to watch Battle Royale.

1118
01:20:37,533 --> 01:20:40,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I got my Battle Royale manga first because we went to A1 Comics.

1119
01:20:42,339 --> 01:20:46,161
[SPEAKER_05]: and then we watched Battle Royale and your impression?

1120
01:20:48,542 --> 01:20:50,423
[SPEAKER_16]: Battle Royale was interesting.

1121
01:20:50,563 --> 01:20:58,487
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it would have been better if Dan wasn't doing, you know, director's commentary during the last half of it, but it was pretty interesting.

1122
01:20:58,907 --> 01:20:59,448
Moving on.

1123
01:20:59,468 --> 01:21:00,148
Paper plate!

1124
01:21:00,228 --> 01:21:00,608
Okay.

1125
01:21:10,666 --> 01:21:13,467
[SPEAKER_05]: This joke ends right now, okay?

1126
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:20,348
[SPEAKER_05]: The plate has been retired.

1127
01:21:20,788 --> 01:21:21,908
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a new weapon.

1128
01:21:22,268 --> 01:21:23,828
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called the smell of pussy.

1129
01:21:28,889 --> 01:21:29,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Or squid.

1130
01:21:30,109 --> 01:21:31,130
[SPEAKER_15]: Janae, put your pants on.

1131
01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:35,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, anyway.

1132
01:21:36,751 --> 01:21:38,691
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and we ended up crashing out.

1133
01:21:39,947 --> 01:21:48,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Next day, we wake up at, well at least I woke up at the ass crack of dawn, you know like 8.30 in the morning, and you were still asleep.

1134
01:21:50,633 --> 01:21:57,977
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went back to bed, got up around 9.30, we bummed around, and then tried to get out of the door, but I kept forgetting stuff.

1135
01:21:58,783 --> 01:22:03,504
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we finally get in Julie's, you know, car that smells like, you know, granny panties.

1136
01:22:05,545 --> 01:22:07,905
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the smell of dust and rotten milk.

1137
01:22:12,246 --> 01:22:18,568
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we had a really nice drive going into San Francisco and then I got lost because I forgot to turn on Van Ness.

1138
01:22:21,059 --> 01:22:25,101
[SPEAKER_05]: and do some direction and just some random turning.

1139
01:22:25,141 --> 01:22:27,382
[SPEAKER_05]: We make it, you know, to Giri and get there.

1140
01:22:27,903 --> 01:22:29,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Go shopping, have good food.

1141
01:22:31,464 --> 01:22:34,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I almost bought SARS masks, but sided against it.

1142
01:22:35,907 --> 01:22:42,910
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we managed to get to a network video with no problem, except for the guy behind me who wanted to kill me.

1143
01:22:44,151 --> 01:22:45,512
[SPEAKER_05]: This guy had this big vehicle.

1144
01:22:45,592 --> 01:22:47,313
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear he was like the worst driver in the world.

1145
01:22:48,133 --> 01:22:48,613
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway...

1146
01:22:50,802 --> 01:22:57,474
[SPEAKER_05]: So the next thing, we get on the 101 South again to go to...

1147
01:22:58,849 --> 01:23:03,911
[SPEAKER_05]: to network, and it turns out he gave us directions to Sunnyvale, because we were trying to get to Milpitas instead.

1148
01:23:04,551 --> 01:23:17,196
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I got directions from, um, from Shark's Girl, from my Waikipoo, and we, uh, managed to get to Milpitas Golf Land, race Delete Horses, and then we came back and said, hey, we want some boba.

1149
01:23:17,216 --> 01:23:21,878
[SPEAKER_05]: So we went to Davis, got... What the fuck is this music?

1150
01:23:22,559 --> 01:23:23,539
[SPEAKER_15]: It's story time music!

1151
01:23:24,039 --> 01:23:25,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, this music needs to go away.

1152
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:26,040
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1153
01:23:27,379 --> 01:23:29,101
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay, but it doesn't fit my story.

1154
01:23:29,121 --> 01:23:30,062
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you want the violins again?

1155
01:23:32,825 --> 01:23:34,286
[SPEAKER_15]: This is some burninating music.

1156
01:23:36,766 --> 01:23:39,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1157
01:23:40,787 --> 01:23:46,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we got back to my place, and we were going to have pizza, but we sort of just didn't make it.

1158
01:23:47,629 --> 01:23:57,212
[SPEAKER_05]: We watched, we played some Soul Calibur 2, and I got my ass handed to me repeatedly every time Marin picked Taki.

1159
01:23:58,092 --> 01:24:02,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, it turned out that I was like super cheap with, who was I super cheap with?

1160
01:24:05,026 --> 01:24:05,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm always cheap.

1161
01:24:06,167 --> 01:24:07,228
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was Seungmino.

1162
01:24:07,248 --> 01:24:08,949
[SPEAKER_05]: When I pulled out Seungmino instead of Kilik.

1163
01:24:09,549 --> 01:24:10,229
[SPEAKER_05]: I was really cheap.

1164
01:24:10,330 --> 01:24:11,530
[SPEAKER_05]: And with Yunsung.

1165
01:24:11,550 --> 01:24:14,532
[SPEAKER_05]: I sucked with Link.

1166
01:24:14,732 --> 01:24:17,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we watched some Shaman King, but she fell asleep.

1167
01:24:17,834 --> 01:24:19,235
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, wake up!

1168
01:24:19,275 --> 01:24:20,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Go upstairs, go stand with the couch.

1169
01:24:23,731 --> 01:24:26,913
[SPEAKER_05]: So she goes to sleep, and I'm playing Ragnarok until 1.30 in the morning.

1170
01:24:27,613 --> 01:24:28,313
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the end.

1171
01:24:28,473 --> 01:24:33,375
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's today, where we just, like, sat around the house, like, most of the morning.

1172
01:24:35,276 --> 01:24:37,417
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, um, what else happened?

1173
01:24:38,418 --> 01:24:44,100
[SPEAKER_05]: We went to the mall, went to Fresh Choice, where the stupid man was, who smelled funny, and stuck on my foot.

1174
01:24:44,921 --> 01:24:50,183
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we, um, we went to see Rob, not Rob, we went to see Dan at work.

1175
01:24:51,243 --> 01:24:52,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Some man's just mumbling in the background.

1176
01:24:54,133 --> 01:25:22,682
[SPEAKER_05]: mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble

1177
01:25:23,524 --> 01:25:24,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us about Trogdor.

1178
01:25:26,645 --> 01:25:28,206
[SPEAKER_16]: Trogdor is a man.

1179
01:25:30,127 --> 01:25:31,607
[SPEAKER_16]: Trogdor is a horseman.

1180
01:25:32,527 --> 01:25:33,908
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, really, he's just a horse.

1181
01:25:34,668 --> 01:25:36,009
[SPEAKER_16]: But still, he's Trogdor.

1182
01:25:39,330 --> 01:25:40,771
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just kind of jazz!

1183
01:25:40,971 --> 01:25:41,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1184
01:25:42,231 --> 01:25:42,731
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

1185
01:25:43,752 --> 01:25:46,353
[SPEAKER_15]: Anybody else have something they want to share for Orange Lounge Storytime?

1186
01:25:46,693 --> 01:25:48,173
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that they did over there.

1187
01:25:50,374 --> 01:25:50,714

[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1190
01:25:52,571 --> 01:25:54,052
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, I have pie.

1191
01:25:55,272 --> 01:25:57,073
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have cake pie, you have apple pie.

1192
01:25:57,893 --> 01:25:58,634
[SPEAKER_08]: I still have pie.

1193
01:25:59,434 --> 01:25:59,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

[SPEAKER_04]: You've got music.

[SPEAKER_04]: Get some Chinese music or something.

1197
01:26:04,396 --> 01:26:05,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't mean that in a bad way, but yeah.

1198
01:26:06,597 --> 01:26:07,558
[SPEAKER_15]: Just tell your damn story.

1199
01:26:09,919 --> 01:26:11,059
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Silver Garden thing.

[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1201
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:13,680
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I pretty much said it.

1202
01:26:14,981 --> 01:26:16,782
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, because of the outbreak thing they were playing?

1203

[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1204
01:26:17,002 --> 01:26:18,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then why did you raise your hand?

1205
01:26:18,782 --> 01:26:19,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1229
01:28:10,956 --> 01:28:14,058
[SPEAKER_15]: You'll know pretty much by looking at it which ones are pretty good.

1230
01:28:14,238 --> 01:28:18,461
[SPEAKER_15]: There's one DJ Demon, I believe, did Max Resurrection.

1231
01:28:18,481 --> 01:28:19,701
[SPEAKER_15]: We played that a while back.

1232

1233
01:28:25,185 --> 01:28:31,969
[SPEAKER_15]: So go vote 10 for mine, because there's just not enough people voting on mine, and I need people to go vote 10, just because.

1234
01:28:32,689 --> 01:28:34,951
[SPEAKER_15]: And then don't just vote a 10, vote everyone else a 1.

1235
01:28:35,272 --> 01:28:36,153
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1236
01:28:36,393 --> 01:28:42,178
[SPEAKER_15]: But post in the thread and talk about how beautiful Loki's remixes are and how his remixes make you want to fuck him.

1237
01:28:45,261 --> 01:28:49,285
[SPEAKER_15]: Just kidding, Nelly.

1238
01:28:53,069 --> 01:28:54,050
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, you can want.

1239
01:28:55,511 --> 01:28:56,873
[SPEAKER_15]: It's nice to want.

1240
01:28:57,660 --> 01:28:59,621
[SPEAKER_15]: But, yeah, there's some pretty good ones.

1241
01:29:00,241 --> 01:29:05,423
[SPEAKER_15]: The one I like, though, there's a really good Paranoia remix in there that's a hip-hop remix of Paranoia.

1242
01:29:05,964 --> 01:29:08,685
[SPEAKER_15]: And maybe we'll get to play that later on in the show, that's pretty good.

1243
01:29:09,345 --> 01:29:12,486
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a Ghosts one that's kind of a piano-ambient one that's pretty good.

1244
01:29:13,107 --> 01:29:16,448
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a So Deep one that's a piano-ambient one that's pretty good.

1245
01:29:17,308 --> 01:29:25,852
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a long version, like a trancy remix, well, a longer trance remix of So Deep that's, yeah, it's alright.

1246
01:29:26,747 --> 01:29:29,691
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, pretty much the Paranoia one, really good.

1247
01:29:30,151 --> 01:29:31,833
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that one deserves a 10 also.

1248
01:29:32,814 --> 01:29:35,037
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, the SoDeep one is pretty good.

1249
01:29:35,057 --> 01:29:36,519
[SPEAKER_15]: The analog mix is pretty good.

1250
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:38,762
[SPEAKER_15]: But yes, vote a 1 for everyone else.

1251
01:29:41,127 --> 01:29:44,928
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a few remixes that I'd name that deserve ones, but I'm not going to name them on the air.

1252
01:29:45,148 --> 01:29:46,808
[SPEAKER_15]: Whistle song.

1253
01:29:49,469 --> 01:29:52,110
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, let's get on with the cage match, shall we?

1254
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:55,891
[SPEAKER_15]: I think our chat room's been kind of a little eager for this, and I am too.

1255
01:29:55,991 --> 01:29:57,891
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm moist with anticipation about this.

1256
01:29:57,971 --> 01:30:06,213
[SPEAKER_15]: So, last week, or two weeks ago, I should say, in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage match, I got you, I got you, Loki.

1257
01:30:07,474 --> 01:30:08,054
[SPEAKER_15]: Remix out.

1258
01:30:09,232 --> 01:30:10,233
[SPEAKER_15]: DJ Tyrant fucks Loki

1259
01:30:29,497 --> 01:30:35,742
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, as I was saying, last week in the cage match, Loki's pick won with this.

1260
01:30:35,802 --> 01:30:43,707
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, by the way, the way the cage match works, all the hosts, the three of us, myself, Loki, DarkSakura, we all pick one song, and they all fight each other per your votes.

1261
01:30:43,887 --> 01:30:45,529
[SPEAKER_15]: So you vote for the song you like best.

1262
01:30:46,609 --> 01:31:05,130
[SPEAKER_15]: and you send those votes over to Sky in the chat room but you can't vote until all three songs have played and then the song with the most votes goes into rotation on Orange Lounge Radio until the next cage match so here was last week's winner and the first song you can vote for tonight it's Don Davis and Juno Reactor with Mona Lisa Overdrive from the movie The Matrix Reloaded enjoy

1263
01:32:33,067 --> 01:32:35,269
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, that's the first song you can vote for this week.

1264
01:32:35,289 --> 01:32:40,434
[SPEAKER_15]: That's Mona Lisa Overdrive here in the Cajun Match.

1265
01:32:40,654 --> 01:32:43,157
[SPEAKER_15]: Matrix Reloaded, very good scene in that movie, by the way.

1266
01:32:43,177 --> 01:32:44,378
[SPEAKER_15]: That was from the freeway chase scene.

1267
01:32:44,838 --> 01:32:49,403
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, second song is going to be DarkSakura's pick, so why don't you tell us all about it?

1268
01:32:50,243 --> 01:32:51,425
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know if it's named right.

1269
01:32:51,465 --> 01:32:53,466
[SPEAKER_05]: It says it's from Final Fantasy X, but I don't think so.

1270
01:32:54,187 --> 01:32:55,729
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just some cool song.

1271
01:32:55,769 --> 01:32:56,810
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even remember the name of it.

1272
01:32:57,458 --> 01:32:58,419
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, I'll name it for you.

1273
01:32:58,459 --> 01:33:04,265
[SPEAKER_15]: It's called Set Me Free and it's labeled by Final Fantasy X, but Jamie can't seem to place this.

1274
01:33:05,226 --> 01:33:08,749
[SPEAKER_15]: And it says it's remixed by Paul Oakenfold, so we'll see.

1275
01:33:09,670 --> 01:33:10,831
[SPEAKER_15]: I highly doubt that.

1276
01:33:10,931 --> 01:33:13,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I doubt it too, but I did think the music was cool.

1277
01:33:13,854 --> 01:33:15,716
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just how it was labeled when I downloaded it.

1278
01:33:16,818 --> 01:33:23,002
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're just going to refer to this as Set Me Free because that's the only part of this song name that we think is correct.

1279
01:33:23,842 --> 01:33:24,323
[SPEAKER_15]: So enjoy.

1280
01:33:24,983 --> 01:33:28,425
[SPEAKER_15]: You only heard a clip of the last song because it won last time.

1281
01:33:28,485 --> 01:33:29,466
[SPEAKER_15]: So you only get to hear a clip.

1282
01:33:29,646 --> 01:33:30,787
[SPEAKER_15]: You get to hear the full one of this.

1283
01:33:30,827 --> 01:33:33,308
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is pick number two for this week.

1284
01:33:33,508 --> 01:33:34,149
[SPEAKER_15]: Set Me Free.

1285
01:33:34,349 --> 01:33:34,589
[SPEAKER_15]: Enjoy.

1286
01:34:23,138 --> 01:34:23,959
Thanks for watching!

1287
01:34:49,670 --> 01:34:49,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1288
01:36:55,541 --> 01:36:59,284
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, that was the first, or I'm sorry, the second song in tonight's cage match.

1289
01:36:59,544 --> 01:37:03,668
[SPEAKER_15]: That was Set Me Free, which may or may not be Final Fantasy, and may or may not be Paul Oakenfold.

1290
01:37:03,768 --> 01:37:04,789
[SPEAKER_15]: So, go figure.

1291
01:37:05,629 --> 01:37:08,452
[SPEAKER_15]: Anybody want to comment on that and give it something on a scale of 1 to 10?

1292
01:37:08,752 --> 01:37:09,052
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie?

1293
01:37:10,573 --> 01:37:09,052
10.

1294
01:37:12,035 --> 01:37:14,417
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, you have anything you want to say about it?

1295
01:37:14,837 --> 01:37:16,278
[SPEAKER_15]: It definitely wasn't Oakenfold.

1296
01:37:16,538 --> 01:37:18,280
[SPEAKER_15]: It could have been a lot better than that.

1297
01:37:19,301 --> 01:37:20,041
[SPEAKER_15]: It was all right.

1298
01:37:20,161 --> 01:37:22,583
[SPEAKER_15]: I couldn't place it anywhere in Final Fantasy at all.

1299
01:37:23,855 --> 01:37:25,316
[SPEAKER_15]: It was just kind of average to me.

1300
01:37:25,376 --> 01:37:28,117
[SPEAKER_15]: I've heard a lot of, you know, trance techno tracks.

1301
01:37:28,137 --> 01:37:28,837
[SPEAKER_15]: It was just average.

1302
01:37:29,398 --> 01:37:30,338
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd give it a seven.

1303
01:37:31,939 --> 01:37:38,422
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I mean, it's very trance in the fact that I see it as kind of like background music, but it's nothing I'd kind of be all, ooh, I've got to listen to this song.

1304
01:37:38,442 --> 01:37:39,182
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, my God, I love this song.

1305
01:37:39,202 --> 01:37:43,244
[SPEAKER_15]: But, like, you know, if it was planned, I'd be, okay, yeah, I'd just kind of, you know, bob my head like the Roxbury guys.

1306
01:37:43,264 --> 01:37:44,805
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, I'd give it a seven and a half.

1307
01:37:44,965 --> 01:37:45,165
[SPEAKER_15]: Cool.

1308
01:37:45,945 --> 01:37:47,606
[SPEAKER_15]: Anybody else want to comment on Set Me Free?

1309
01:37:50,608 --> 01:37:51,048
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura?

1310
01:37:52,338 --> 01:37:52,978
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I liked it.

1311
01:37:53,038 --> 01:37:56,541
[SPEAKER_11]: It would probably make good background music for, like, First Man Net or something.

1312
01:37:56,861 --> 01:37:57,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, seven and a half.

1313
01:37:58,442 --> 01:37:58,742
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh-huh.

1314
01:37:59,142 --> 01:38:00,983
[SPEAKER_15]: Anybody over here in this corner want to comment on Set Me Free?

1315
01:38:01,264 --> 01:38:01,524
[SPEAKER_15]: Anybody?

1316
01:38:01,844 --> 01:38:02,324
[SPEAKER_15]: Anybody, anybody?

1317
01:38:02,404 --> 01:38:03,645
[SPEAKER_04]: It was okay, but, uh... You good?

1318
01:38:03,665 --> 01:38:03,765
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1319
01:38:03,785 --> 01:38:06,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I don't know, do you want me to rate it?

1320
01:38:07,187 --> 01:38:07,488
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1321
01:38:08,248 --> 01:38:10,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, no?

1322
01:38:10,970 --> 01:38:11,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I won't.

1323
01:38:12,090 --> 01:38:12,931
[SPEAKER_15]: No, you have to rate it.

1324
01:38:14,852 --> 01:38:16,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been denied or something.

1325
01:38:16,273 --> 01:38:17,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, um, seven.

1326
01:38:18,675 --> 01:38:18,955
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1327
01:38:19,515 --> 01:38:20,676
[SPEAKER_13]: So, any, oh, Magus?

1328
01:38:21,365 --> 01:38:27,209
[SPEAKER_15]: Very trancy, really good like working music if you're like working on some like platform or anything like that.

1329
01:38:27,229 --> 01:38:27,990
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd probably give it an 8.

1330
01:38:28,670 --> 01:38:29,911
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good burninating music.

1331
01:38:29,991 --> 01:38:30,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1332
01:38:30,732 --> 01:38:31,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hacking or burninating.

1333
01:38:31,993 --> 01:38:32,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there we go.

1334
01:38:33,614 --> 01:38:35,335
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good music for decorating cakes too.

1335
01:38:35,816 --> 01:38:36,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1336
01:38:37,057 --> 01:38:39,959
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.

1337
01:38:40,199 --> 01:38:41,760
[SPEAKER_15]: Some cake decorating music.

1338
01:38:41,980 --> 01:38:42,481
[SPEAKER_15]: I like that.

1339
01:38:43,001 --> 01:38:43,982
[SPEAKER_03]: I like driving to it.

1340
01:38:44,082 --> 01:38:44,802
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1341
01:38:45,003 --> 01:38:46,284
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other comments on Set Me Free?

1342
01:38:46,824 --> 01:38:47,364
[SPEAKER_15]: Anybody, anybody?

1343
01:38:47,665 --> 01:38:48,946
[SPEAKER_15]: You could be influencing the votes.

1344
01:38:49,686 --> 01:38:50,667
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, we have a hand.

1345
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:53,692
[SPEAKER_15]: Good music to refurbish cabinets to.

1346
01:38:55,934 --> 01:38:56,355
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1347
01:38:57,816 --> 01:38:58,677
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, moving on.

1348
01:38:59,718 --> 01:39:02,941
[SPEAKER_15]: The third and final song in tonight's cage match is my pick.

1349
01:39:03,462 --> 01:39:07,746
[SPEAKER_15]: And I decided to go the slutty route and I picked a former porno star.

1350
01:39:09,568 --> 01:39:10,709
[SPEAKER_15]: I picked Tracy Lords.

1351
01:39:11,469 --> 01:39:12,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I call it or did I?

1352
01:39:12,930 --> 01:39:15,532
[SPEAKER_15]: And this song is kind of, it's a couple years old.

1353
01:39:15,872 --> 01:39:18,554
[SPEAKER_15]: And a lot of people know this song from the Mortal Kombat soundtrack.

1354
01:39:18,574 --> 01:39:19,435
[SPEAKER_15]: It's called Control.

1355
01:39:19,775 --> 01:39:21,756
[SPEAKER_15]: But this is the version that has the vocals in it.

1356
01:39:21,796 --> 01:39:23,117
[SPEAKER_15]: So you can be really slutty.

1357
01:39:23,557 --> 01:39:27,280
[SPEAKER_15]: So everybody get naked because this is the song to have some sex to.

1358
01:39:27,940 --> 01:39:30,142
[SPEAKER_15]: This is my pick for this week's cage match.

1359
01:39:30,202 --> 01:39:31,583
[SPEAKER_15]: It's Tracy Lords with Control.

1360
01:39:44,182 --> 01:39:44,982
Thanks for watching!

1361
01:43:03,402 --> 01:43:07,463
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, that was Tracy Lords with Control, so let's get thoughts and reaction on that one.

1362
01:43:07,483 --> 01:43:07,783
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie?

1363
01:43:09,064 --> 01:43:14,385
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cool, but I've had that version for a long time myself, so for me it's kind of old.

1364
01:43:15,286 --> 01:43:19,107
[SPEAKER_05]: It still doesn't mean it's unless it's a good song, I'd give it probably a 7.5.

1365
01:43:19,727 --> 01:43:21,928
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, anybody else want to comment on Control?

1366
01:43:26,909 --> 01:43:32,571
[SPEAKER_15]: I love that song because that brings me back to Q's our days, where we used to play with the Mortal Kombat soundtrack all the time.

1367
01:43:33,180 --> 01:43:39,304
[SPEAKER_15]: and that movie, while being a really sucky movie overall, it was good at it's time.

1368
01:43:40,224 --> 01:43:41,085
[SPEAKER_15]: I like this on U.S.

1369
01:43:42,646 --> 01:43:43,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Dark Tetsuya?

1370
01:43:44,066 --> 01:43:45,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, this is okay.

1371
01:43:45,387 --> 01:43:45,888
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll give it a 7.

1372
01:43:46,028 --> 01:43:46,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Angel?

1373
01:43:48,029 --> 01:43:49,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, Mortal Kombat 6A.

1374
01:43:49,570 --> 01:43:51,451
[SPEAKER_09]: What was the soundtrack to it?

1375
01:43:51,511 --> 01:43:52,732
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

1376
01:43:53,112 --> 01:43:53,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

1377
01:43:53,652 --> 01:43:55,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, okay, um, I'll give it an 8.

1378
01:43:57,134 --> 01:43:59,135
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to rip off someone's head, I'll give it a 7.

1379
01:43:59,576 --> 01:43:59,956
[SPEAKER_15]: It's good.

1380
01:44:01,221 --> 01:44:06,647
[SPEAKER_15]: Nothing kicks more ass than the World Combat The Game soundtrack.

1381
01:44:08,909 --> 01:44:09,489
[SPEAKER_15]: I have that.

1382
01:44:09,629 --> 01:44:10,170
[SPEAKER_15]: I had that.

1383
01:44:10,510 --> 01:44:13,834
[SPEAKER_15]: I need a copy of that, though.

1384
01:44:13,934 --> 01:44:19,379
[SPEAKER_15]: I would agree with Nico Adachi in the chatroom who says it sounds like techno stripper music.

1385
01:44:19,599 --> 01:44:19,960
[SPEAKER_15]: Amen.

1386
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:21,221
[SPEAKER_15]: Total stripper music.

1387
01:44:21,982 --> 01:44:22,863
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, another comment?

1388
01:44:23,837 --> 01:44:25,298
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be my cage dance music.

1389
01:44:25,599 --> 01:44:27,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, I love that.

1390
01:44:28,121 --> 01:44:28,542
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd give it a 10.

1391
01:44:29,322 --> 01:44:31,344
[SPEAKER_15]: So how appropriate for the cage match.

1392
01:44:33,687 --> 01:44:34,527
[SPEAKER_07]: That was really bad.

1393
01:44:34,547 --> 01:44:35,388
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I know.

1394
01:44:35,408 --> 01:44:35,989
[SPEAKER_15]: That joke gets a 2.

1395
01:44:36,609 --> 01:44:39,592
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, anybody else, any other comments on Tracy Miller's control?

1396
01:44:39,612 --> 01:44:39,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, mine is 2.

1397
01:44:42,803 --> 01:44:43,043
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

1398
01:44:43,063 --> 01:44:43,424
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, what?

1399
01:44:43,444 --> 01:44:45,965
[SPEAKER_03]: I like her pornography better than her music.

1400
01:44:47,186 --> 01:44:48,647
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a really funny one, though.

1401
01:44:48,787 --> 01:44:51,308
[SPEAKER_05]: It was, like, I think her first album that she did.

1402
01:44:52,069 --> 01:44:56,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Just about, like, this girl who would, like, seduce these guys and then, like, kick her ass.

1403
01:44:59,433 --> 01:45:00,593
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to find that CD again.

1404
01:45:01,854 --> 01:45:04,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Next time for your cage match, pick Carmen Alexa.

1405
01:45:05,436 --> 01:45:08,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Please, find some, like, Carmen Alexa and play it.

1406
01:45:09,147 --> 01:45:10,048
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see, we'll see.

1407
01:45:10,128 --> 01:45:12,069
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, you can send in those votes now.

1408
01:45:12,109 --> 01:45:14,371
[SPEAKER_15]: You can send those over private message to me in the chatroom.

1409
01:45:14,411 --> 01:45:17,813
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Sky, and you just, if you're not in the chatroom, get your ass in there.

1410

1412
01:45:24,538 --> 01:45:26,299
[SPEAKER_15]: Song number one is last week's winner.

[SPEAKER_15]: It's Mona Lisa Overdrive.

1414
01:45:36,540 --> 01:45:38,502

[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so, that's a cage match.

1420
01:46:08,248 --> 01:46:10,628
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody wake up, cage match is over.

1421
01:46:10,848 --> 01:46:13,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Cage match is usually a part of a show where people in the studio fall asleep.

1422
01:46:15,129 --> 01:46:19,210
[SPEAKER_15]: I kind of have to pee, but I don't want to pee because we just played a bunch of music, so I don't want to go to break.

1423
01:46:20,271 --> 01:46:23,251
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, what are you... You're disgusting.

1424

[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, why don't you tell us about some of the new vinyl you got this week?

01:46:53,962 --> 01:46:54,862
[SPEAKER_15]: I can make a remix!

[SPEAKER_15]: Cool.

1445
01:48:06,125 --> 01:48:10,286
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got... Oh shit, I'm trying to remember.

1446
01:48:12,227 --> 01:48:14,507
[SPEAKER_15]: Just give me one second.

1447
01:48:15,008 --> 01:48:15,208
[SPEAKER_15]: One.

01:48:15,228 --> 01:48:17,388

01:48:53,054 --> 01:48:54,797
[SPEAKER_15]: Second, I need to learn how to beatmix.

1453
01:48:55,898 --> 01:48:58,362
[SPEAKER_15]: Kind of an important part of the mix show.

1454
01:48:59,724 --> 01:49:01,006
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I seriously need to practice.

1455
01:49:01,026 --> 01:49:02,989
[SPEAKER_15]: I haven't practiced at all, period.

1456
01:49:03,389 --> 01:49:07,315
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, drama and stuff is preventing me from doing so, so, yeah.

1459
01:49:16,501 --> 01:49:16,821
[SPEAKER_12]: You what?

1460
01:49:17,101 --> 01:49:18,502
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe I should start doing a Friday show.

1461
01:49:18,802 --> 01:49:23,863
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, I've, uh, I think I'm gonna start, I've tossed the idea around.

1462
01:49:23,883 --> 01:49:26,743
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really inconvenient for me to do one during the week, but Fridays I could do a show.

1463
01:49:27,043 --> 01:49:33,144
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, well, I mean, don't also tie yourself down, because what you can do, you can pre-tape, like, four in a row, and then play them later.

1464
01:49:33,164 --> 01:49:33,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would I do that?

1465
01:49:34,344 --> 01:49:34,725
[SPEAKER_15]: If you want.

1466
01:49:35,005 --> 01:49:36,865
[SPEAKER_05]: That sort of defeats the purpose of me doing a live show.

1467
01:49:37,704 --> 01:49:38,105
[SPEAKER_15]: It's up to you.

1468
01:49:38,145 --> 01:49:39,826
[SPEAKER_15]: If you want to do a live show, do it.

1469
01:49:40,366 --> 01:49:43,548
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm thinking about doing a tape show about remixes and originals.

1470
01:49:44,709 --> 01:49:44,989
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe.

1471
01:49:45,169 --> 01:49:46,610
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm kind of toying with that idea.

1472
01:49:46,650 --> 01:49:48,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine's all random crap anyway.

1473
01:49:48,371 --> 01:49:55,216
[SPEAKER_05]: You think maybe this Friday I might do another... If I can get the samples, I might do another video game trivia.

1474
01:49:56,857 --> 01:49:58,238
[SPEAKER_15]: You should call it Taberninate.

1475
01:49:58,898 --> 01:49:59,199
[SPEAKER_15]: Ha!

1476
01:49:59,659 --> 01:49:59,859
[SPEAKER_15]: Ha!

1477
01:50:00,119 --> 01:50:00,279
[SPEAKER_15]: Ha!

1478
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:01,720
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I think the Berninate joke.

1479
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:04,322
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't want to run that into the ground.

1480
01:50:04,402 --> 01:50:05,383
[SPEAKER_05]: The Berninate jokes...

1481
01:50:06,167 --> 01:50:06,969
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Dark Tetsuya.

1482
01:50:06,989 --> 01:50:08,391
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to raise your hand, you're not in school.

1483
01:50:09,132 --> 01:50:10,094
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, he has to get a mic, though.

1484
01:50:11,056 --> 01:50:11,897
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to get a third mic.

1485
01:50:11,917 --> 01:50:15,523
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we need to get Espo back into the chat room so I can get my title back from him.

1486
01:50:18,008 --> 01:50:18,428
[SPEAKER_15]: Good point.

1487
01:50:18,905 --> 01:50:20,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it while he's not there.

1488
01:50:20,366 --> 01:50:21,126
[SPEAKER_15]: Get it while he's not there.

1489
01:50:45,498 --> 01:50:49,379
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so we're going to get capped on the number of listeners we can have, but don't worry, you guys.

1490
01:50:49,459 --> 01:50:50,680
[SPEAKER_15]: You'll still be able to get through.

1491
01:50:51,300 --> 01:50:53,781
[SPEAKER_15]: If we have to raise the bar by paying a little more, we will.

1492
01:50:53,841 --> 01:50:54,181
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever.

1493
01:50:54,521 --> 01:50:55,041
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll deal with it.

1494
01:50:55,581 --> 01:50:56,782
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm pretty sure we're going to be safe for now.

1495
01:50:56,842 --> 01:50:59,703
[SPEAKER_15]: But we get more space, so we can add way more songs to our playlist.

1496
01:51:00,143 --> 01:51:11,467
[SPEAKER_15]: So we could do, like, specialized Guitar Freaks playlist, specialized 2DX and Papa Music playlist, which is an idea being tossed around, because we can use our nifty little auto-scheduler and bring some more variety to the day.

1497
01:51:12,691 --> 01:51:15,933
[SPEAKER_15]: So we hope you're listening to Orange Launch Radio all day long because, you know, we play good music.

1498
01:51:16,194 --> 01:51:16,494
[SPEAKER_15]: Damn it.

1499
01:51:19,316 --> 01:51:19,496
[SPEAKER_15]: Huh?

1500
01:51:20,737 --> 01:51:22,658
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so we're going to go to break now so I can pee.

1501
01:51:24,019 --> 01:51:25,480
[SPEAKER_15]: And tally the votes for Cage Match.

1502
01:51:25,801 --> 01:51:27,222
[SPEAKER_15]: Magus, your vote doesn't count because you're here.

1503
01:51:28,383 --> 01:51:28,703
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.

1504
01:51:30,124 --> 01:51:32,045
[SPEAKER_15]: I just see your name in red and I already know.

1505
01:51:32,306 --> 01:51:32,606
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.

1506
01:51:34,047 --> 01:51:35,408
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie, any requests for this break?

1507
01:51:36,769 --> 01:51:41,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go with Little Red Corvette.

1508
01:51:41,598 --> 01:51:44,159
[SPEAKER_15]: You want to hear Little Red... What does Little Red Corvette have to do with Balani?

1509
01:51:44,319 --> 01:51:44,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

1510
01:51:45,119 --> 01:51:45,699
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Prince.

1511
01:51:47,740 --> 01:51:48,540
[SPEAKER_15]: You're... Okay.

1512
01:51:50,021 --> 01:51:51,001
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm not reading that.

1513
01:51:52,422 --> 01:51:55,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, why don't we go with, um, some Keyboard Mania stuff?

1514
01:51:56,043 --> 01:51:57,023
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, some Keyboard Mania.

1515
01:51:57,043 --> 01:51:58,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go with Loose 100 Seconds.

1516
01:51:58,844 --> 01:51:59,964
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I can do that.

1517
01:52:00,564 --> 01:52:01,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Um... Let's go with Klunk Klunk.

1518
01:52:02,845 --> 01:52:03,525
[SPEAKER_15]: Hold on, hold on.

1519
01:52:03,545 --> 01:52:04,406
[SPEAKER_15]: Getting him, getting him, getting him.

1520
01:52:05,386 --> 01:52:05,466
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh...

1521
01:52:08,387 --> 01:52:09,887
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to hear Klunkang.

1522
01:52:10,107 --> 01:52:11,768
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll hear Least 100 Seconds.

1523
01:52:11,788 --> 01:52:12,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Vitalize.

1524
01:52:13,108 --> 01:52:13,288
[SPEAKER_15]: Huh?

1525
01:52:13,428 --> 01:52:13,908
[SPEAKER_15]: Vitalize?

1526
01:52:15,589 --> 01:52:17,529
[SPEAKER_15]: Vitalize, I think I have filed under Guitar Freaks.

1527
01:52:17,669 --> 01:52:18,710
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, we'll do Vitalize.

1528
01:52:19,190 --> 01:52:20,890
[SPEAKER_15]: And I want to throw in a song for Janae.

1529
01:52:22,611 --> 01:52:24,191
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to throw in a song just for you, Janae.

1530
01:52:24,211 --> 01:52:24,831
[SPEAKER_15]: You're not even listening.

1531
01:52:24,851 --> 01:52:25,231
[SPEAKER_15]: That's okay.

1532
01:52:29,012 --> 01:52:29,673
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, dang.

1533
01:52:29,893 --> 01:52:30,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Dang, I got snapped.

1534
01:52:33,474 --> 01:52:34,774
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, we'll be back.

1535
01:56:05,723 --> 01:56:07,684
and the rest of the band.

1536
01:56:30,265 --> 01:56:45,978
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in the back of your mind, a smile, but I'm not so blind Just reach out, it's all for love, you'll be the star tonight Get with it, finalize, you gotta tell me You know it's too late when you're dead, night, night, last in line

1537
01:57:50,793 --> 01:57:57,656
I need to know how you feel I just can't find my love for you I'm giving all my heart to you, my love I just can't find my love for you

1538
01:58:17,703 --> 01:58:32,313
I just decide my love for you I just decide my love for you I'm giving all my heart to you, my love I just decide my love for you I'm giving you my heart, my soul, my love I just decide my love for you I'm giving all my heart to you, my love I just decide my love for you

1539
01:58:58,500 --> 01:59:01,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.

1540
01:59:02,332 --> 01:59:03,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge Radio

1541
01:59:05,391 --> 01:59:06,371
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, we're back.

1542
01:59:06,912 --> 01:59:08,832
[SPEAKER_15]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1543
01:59:09,593 --> 01:59:13,614
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have the winner of this week's cage match, boys and girls.

1544
01:59:14,274 --> 01:59:16,655
[SPEAKER_15]: And this was a very, very close vote, you guys.

1545
01:59:16,995 --> 01:59:21,857
[SPEAKER_15]: The winning song only had one vote more than the other two songs.

1546
01:59:22,497 --> 01:59:26,339
[SPEAKER_15]: So, like, the other two songs were tied, and the winning one only had one more vote than them.

1547
01:59:26,839 --> 01:59:27,399
[SPEAKER_15]: So here it is.

1548
01:59:27,459 --> 01:59:31,321
[SPEAKER_15]: Your winning song... Once again is Mona Lisa Overdrive.

1549
01:59:33,522 --> 01:59:33,822
[SPEAKER_15]: We...

1550
01:59:37,538 --> 01:59:38,619
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, wait, I'm sorry, what'd you say?

1551
01:59:39,379 --> 01:59:47,224
[SPEAKER_00]: I was saying, of course, it's riding off the frickin' boom success and jive or whatever, no, hype of the Matrix, so, what do you expect, I mean?

1552
01:59:47,644 --> 01:59:48,885
[SPEAKER_00]: What, you talkin' jive?

1553
01:59:48,905 --> 01:59:54,569
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, jive, I don't know, I guess it's cause Janace... Janace?

1554
01:59:55,269 --> 01:59:56,690
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I hear hissing.

1555
01:59:59,412 --> 02:00:01,293
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, uh, so there you go.

1556
02:00:07,254 --> 02:00:08,174
[SPEAKER_15]: So, what now?

1557
02:00:08,474 --> 02:00:09,715
[SPEAKER_15]: I have nothing left to talk about.

1558
02:00:09,755 --> 02:00:10,555
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's just end the show.

1559
02:00:11,115 --> 02:00:11,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, bye.

1560
02:00:12,756 --> 02:00:15,637
[SPEAKER_12]: Does anybody have things they want to talk about for now?

1561
02:00:16,177 --> 02:00:18,398
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't done any of our game shows in a long time.

1562
02:00:18,818 --> 02:00:19,218
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait, what?

1563
02:00:19,438 --> 02:00:21,179
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't done any of our shows in a long time.

1564
02:00:21,199 --> 02:00:22,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Any of our game shows?

1565
02:00:22,159 --> 02:00:22,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Our game shows.

1566
02:00:23,180 --> 02:00:23,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Match Game.

1567
02:00:24,220 --> 02:00:26,321
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm really afraid to do Match Game because there's too many people here.

1568
02:00:26,846 --> 02:00:28,527
[SPEAKER_05]: So we just pick, you know, a few of us.

1569
02:00:28,587 --> 02:00:29,288
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, this is what we'll do.

1570
02:00:29,328 --> 02:00:30,188
[SPEAKER_15]: This is what we'll do.

1571
02:00:30,469 --> 02:00:31,309
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll do match game.

1572
02:00:31,809 --> 02:00:37,713
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll do match game, and for the celebrities, for the celebrities, you pick one, and Loki will pick one, and I'll pick one.

1573
02:00:38,514 --> 02:00:39,114
[SPEAKER_15]: For celebrities.

1574
02:00:40,175 --> 02:00:41,456
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so, who are celebrities?

1575
02:00:41,916 --> 02:00:43,758
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, I haven't written questions for match game.

1576
02:00:43,778 --> 02:00:44,398
[SPEAKER_15]: What am I going to do?

1577
02:00:45,179 --> 02:00:45,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Just type them up.

1578
02:00:46,239 --> 02:00:46,720
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll chat.

1579
02:00:47,120 --> 02:00:47,420
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1580
02:00:48,501 --> 02:00:50,102
[SPEAKER_15]: Chat about something while I think of questions.

1581
02:00:52,345 --> 02:00:54,506
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah, we were going to do Bomani Mad Libs tonight.

1582
02:00:54,746 --> 02:00:55,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's right.

1583
02:00:55,786 --> 02:00:57,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we... But I haven't typed with any.

1584
02:00:57,827 --> 02:00:58,367
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1585
02:00:58,487 --> 02:00:59,727
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on, let me see if I can find some.

1586
02:01:01,748 --> 02:01:03,369
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have to give me the computer to do it, Rob.

1587
02:01:03,409 --> 02:01:04,609
[SPEAKER_15]: You need to fill in with a story.

1588
02:01:05,189 --> 02:01:05,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1589
02:01:05,409 --> 02:01:06,169
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, give me the computer.

1590
02:01:07,410 --> 02:01:09,090
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to give Jamie the computer.

1591
02:01:09,110 --> 02:01:09,611
[SPEAKER_15]: This is bad.

1592
02:01:09,751 --> 02:01:09,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Here.

1593
02:01:10,971 --> 02:01:11,171
[SPEAKER_15]: Here.

1594
02:01:12,051 --> 02:01:12,952
[SPEAKER_15]: This is fucked up.

1595
02:01:16,553 --> 02:01:20,454
[SPEAKER_00]: While you're waiting for him to do this stuff, go to RagnarokOnline.com and download that game.

1596
02:01:21,974 --> 02:01:25,075
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't want to do it now because they'll interrupt their stream for Orange Blossom Radio.

1597
02:01:26,235 --> 02:01:27,756
[SPEAKER_15]: We already just heard like a ton of music.

1598
02:01:28,256 --> 02:01:30,056
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't everybody have like a T1 connection?

1599
02:01:30,096 --> 02:01:30,397
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.

1600
02:01:30,477 --> 02:01:31,537
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll get to your music later, don't worry.

1601
02:01:33,818 --> 02:01:34,698
[SPEAKER_15]: Talk about shit.

1602
02:01:34,998 --> 02:01:36,758
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I took a big dump earlier.

1603
02:01:36,778 --> 02:01:37,259
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm kidding.

1604
02:01:39,159 --> 02:01:39,619
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you leaving?

1605
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:43,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I gotta go.

1606
02:01:43,480 --> 02:01:44,201
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, guys.

1607
02:01:45,721 --> 02:01:47,122
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to having to leave early.

1608
02:01:47,922 --> 02:01:49,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, soul, peace, and chicken grease.

1609
02:01:50,002 --> 02:01:51,243
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's to the third season.

1610
02:01:52,267 --> 02:01:52,707
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1611
02:01:52,847 --> 02:01:53,808
[SPEAKER_15]: Drinks on the house.

1612
02:01:54,368 --> 02:01:56,710
[SPEAKER_15]: As Battle Royale would say, one down, 13 to go.

1613
02:01:56,870 --> 02:01:58,551
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want any more freaking drinks.

1614
02:01:58,951 --> 02:01:59,271
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

1615
02:02:00,632 --> 02:02:00,872
[SPEAKER_15]: So...

1616
02:02:04,469 --> 02:02:07,110
[SPEAKER_15]: Marin, tell us about this little manga you're reading.

1617
02:02:07,130 --> 02:02:13,412
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the first volume of the English edition of Battle Royale.

1618
02:02:14,453 --> 02:02:16,914
[SPEAKER_16]: And Jamie handed it to me, so I am looking at it.

1619
02:02:17,474 --> 02:02:19,174
[SPEAKER_16]: And hi, Smoss, because I know your name.

1620
02:02:20,235 --> 02:02:26,137
[SPEAKER_16]: And the art is kind of interesting, and there's like a squirrel-faced guy in here that I really want to die.

1621
02:02:26,217 --> 02:02:27,437
[SPEAKER_16]: And hopefully he will die soon.

1622
02:02:28,158 --> 02:02:30,118
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's about it.

1623
02:02:30,418 --> 02:02:31,999
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't you think the Battle Royale thing is getting old?

1624
02:02:32,870 --> 02:02:36,212
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I had never seen Battle Royale until yesterday, so... Oh, okay.

1625
02:02:36,232 --> 02:02:36,952
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's still new for you.

1626
02:02:37,152 --> 02:02:37,593
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just teasing.

1627
02:02:37,613 --> 02:02:38,553
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just giving Javen a hard time.

1628
02:02:41,775 --> 02:02:42,175
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, okay.

1629
02:02:42,595 --> 02:02:43,236
[SPEAKER_15]: I get a long mic.

1630
02:02:43,616 --> 02:02:45,297
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll come over here to the cuddling folks.

1631
02:02:46,718 --> 02:02:53,141
[SPEAKER_15]: And since they wanted me to talk about marriage this episode and the people that are going to get married on this episode, I'm just kidding.

1632
02:02:53,181 --> 02:02:53,722
[SPEAKER_15]: I know you guys.

1633
02:02:53,742 --> 02:02:54,602
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys are still young.

1634
02:02:54,802 --> 02:02:56,203
[SPEAKER_12]: You're still young and have a long way to go.

1635
02:02:56,543 --> 02:02:58,304
[SPEAKER_12]: But are you enjoying each other's company this weekend?

1636
02:02:58,804 --> 02:02:59,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1637
02:02:59,425 --> 02:03:00,325
[SPEAKER_04]: What am I going to say?

1638
02:03:00,405 --> 02:03:00,565
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1639
02:03:04,585 --> 02:03:05,125
[SPEAKER_15]: It's cute.

1640
02:03:06,506 --> 02:03:09,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, speaking of which, we did play those two in Scandia yesterday.

1641
02:03:10,748 --> 02:03:13,409
[SPEAKER_15]: How much time did you guys collectively spend at Scandia this weekend?

1642
02:03:14,109 --> 02:03:15,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, let's see, wait.

1643
02:03:15,790 --> 02:03:17,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Friday and Saturday.

1644
02:03:18,271 --> 02:03:19,412
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, probably, you know.

1645
02:03:19,852 --> 02:03:20,252
[SPEAKER_14]: About 12 hours?

1646
02:03:20,272 --> 02:03:21,713
[SPEAKER_14]: 6 hours each day?

1647
02:03:21,953 --> 02:03:22,413
[SPEAKER_14]: Pretty much.

1648
02:03:22,754 --> 02:03:24,694
[SPEAKER_15]: Any annoying Scandia people stories you want to tell?

1649
02:03:25,095 --> 02:03:27,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Kids running across the DDR machine while you're trying to play.

1650
02:03:27,556 --> 02:03:28,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, it's not a crosswalk.

1651
02:03:28,896 --> 02:03:29,637
[SPEAKER_04]: On stage, I mean.

1652
02:03:31,358 --> 02:03:32,198
[SPEAKER_13]: I think, you know what?

1653
02:03:32,833 --> 02:03:35,134
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a picture of it.

1654
02:03:35,174 --> 02:03:43,857
[SPEAKER_15]: We had like this three-year-old up on the extreme just jumping around on stage to Rhythm and Police Lite.

1655
02:03:44,397 --> 02:03:45,318
[SPEAKER_15]: It was hilarious.

1656
02:03:45,338 --> 02:03:46,758
[SPEAKER_15]: We have like two pictures.

1657
02:03:46,778 --> 02:03:47,659
[SPEAKER_15]: They'll be up on the album.

1658
02:03:48,859 --> 02:03:49,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

1659
02:03:50,700 --> 02:03:51,220
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Loki?

1660
02:03:54,841 --> 02:03:57,422
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, you want to talk about Seattle and the bar holding thing?

1661
02:03:57,442 --> 02:03:58,643
[SPEAKER_15]: That's actually an excellent topic.

1662
02:03:58,723 --> 02:03:59,743
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I like this topic.

1663
02:04:00,143 --> 02:04:01,164
[SPEAKER_15]: Because, okay...

1664
02:04:02,153 --> 02:04:03,394
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't bring anything up, Rob.

1665
02:04:18,339 --> 02:04:20,241
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1666
02:04:45,303 --> 02:04:52,069
[SPEAKER_15]: But Seattle was kind of getting, I guess, knocked or jabbed at or poked fun at or whatever for being big old bar rapers.

1667
02:04:52,189 --> 02:04:56,953
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, they hold onto the bar when they play their songs, which kind of creates a little bit of controversy.

1668
02:04:56,993 --> 02:04:58,514
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that real PA or whatever?

1669
02:04:58,534 --> 02:04:59,455
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, is it real?

1670
02:05:00,294 --> 02:05:09,540
[SPEAKER_15]: and to them, looking at us, like, the way they're kind of looking at, or I should say, when I say us, I mean California, the way Seattle was kind of looking at California was kind of like, what's a big fucking deal?

1671
02:05:09,800 --> 02:05:10,121
[SPEAKER_15]: You know?

1672
02:05:10,701 --> 02:05:12,502
[SPEAKER_15]: It's that the bars are there, so why not use them?

1673
02:05:12,863 --> 02:05:13,563
[SPEAKER_15]: So what do you guys think?

1674
02:05:13,583 --> 02:05:16,405
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just curious of people's opinions in here on bar raping, quote unquote.

1675
02:05:18,086 --> 02:05:20,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, oops, okay, switch back off, okay.

1676
02:05:21,228 --> 02:05:29,934
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I really don't give a shit, because I saw a guy, Triple A, Max 300, yes, he was raping the bar, but I'd like to see anybody else try that.

1677
02:05:31,047 --> 02:05:32,749
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really matter.

1678
02:05:34,672 --> 02:05:36,114
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, we do have a bleeder, okay?

1679
02:05:36,154 --> 02:05:36,394
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway.

1680
02:05:36,995 --> 02:05:39,177
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, think about it.

1681
02:05:39,898 --> 02:05:41,120
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't want to fall on his ass.

1682
02:05:41,140 --> 02:05:44,364
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't want to break his leg like whatever that guy's name was.

1683
02:05:45,125 --> 02:05:48,389
[SPEAKER_00]: So, at least he's not freestyling and holding onto the bar.

1684
02:05:48,429 --> 02:05:49,030
[SPEAKER_00]: That's different.

1685
02:05:49,070 --> 02:05:49,771
[SPEAKER_00]: But PAing...

1686
02:05:51,585 --> 02:06:02,211
[SPEAKER_15]: The only thing I didn't like, and it had nothing to do with bar raping, was the constant spraying down of Windex on the thing to rub down the pads to make sure they were absolutely clear and free of dust.

1687
02:06:02,311 --> 02:06:02,952
[SPEAKER_15]: That was interesting.

1688
02:06:03,032 --> 02:06:04,593
[SPEAKER_15]: I do think that was overdone a little bit.

1689
02:06:04,953 --> 02:06:12,137
[SPEAKER_15]: I can see the need, okay, you're in a competition, and you want to make sure everything is perfect, perfection, but I was kind of like...

1690
02:06:12,777 --> 02:06:14,658
[SPEAKER_15]: It does seem a little bit excessive.

1691
02:06:14,758 --> 02:06:15,178
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1692
02:06:15,218 --> 02:06:16,839
[SPEAKER_15]: But then again, it's another thing.

1693
02:06:16,999 --> 02:06:20,661
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just culture, diversity, even within the DDR community, you know?

1694
02:06:21,041 --> 02:06:22,281
[SPEAKER_15]: Up there, it's like, what's the big fucking deal?

1695
02:06:22,301 --> 02:06:23,782
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what Windex is for, to clean things.

1696
02:06:26,243 --> 02:06:29,385
[SPEAKER_15]: I only ever use... No, I don't even use Windex.

1697
02:06:29,825 --> 02:06:35,948
[SPEAKER_15]: The only time I ever clean up pads is when I'm playing doubles, because if I'm going to be putting all my weight in one foot, I want to fucking slip and die.

1698
02:06:35,968 --> 02:06:37,908
[SPEAKER_15]: If I'm playing singles, whatever.

1699
02:06:38,088 --> 02:06:39,349
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, whatever the pads are, fine.

1700
02:06:39,829 --> 02:06:41,370
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if...

1701
02:06:41,983 --> 02:06:52,147
[SPEAKER_00]: They realize or even notice, but if you wash them, if you use some sort of solution to clean the pads, it makes it slippier, slippier, slipperier, slipper, whatever.

1702
02:06:52,747 --> 02:06:53,868
[SPEAKER_00]: Slip, more slick.

1703
02:06:54,408 --> 02:06:55,168
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, slick.

1704
02:06:55,949 --> 02:06:56,329
[SPEAKER_00]: Slicker.

1705
02:06:56,849 --> 02:06:58,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, it does.

1706
02:06:59,010 --> 02:07:00,130
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they notice that or not.

1707
02:07:01,211 --> 02:07:04,112
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe I should stop using, like, chicken grease, but I don't know.

1708
02:07:05,646 --> 02:07:07,447
[SPEAKER_15]: This is my thought on the whole bar thing.

1709
02:07:08,467 --> 02:07:15,590
[SPEAKER_15]: I always said before going to B3 and watching this in action, I always said, you know what, I'm not going to hold on to the bar because I'll look like a retard if I hold on to the bar and play DDR.

1710
02:07:15,970 --> 02:07:21,272
[SPEAKER_15]: But after seeing some of those scores, I'm like, oh my god, I think I'm going to go back and start doing it.

1711
02:07:21,972 --> 02:07:25,133
[SPEAKER_15]: because if holding onto the bar will make me that much better, I'm going to do it.

1712
02:07:25,213 --> 02:07:28,293
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't care if there's this stigma like, oh, you're not supposed to hold onto the bar.

1713
02:07:28,553 --> 02:07:28,953
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck it.

1714
02:07:29,053 --> 02:07:31,194
[SPEAKER_15]: If I can get scores that good, I'm going to hold onto the bar.

1715
02:07:31,554 --> 02:07:37,155
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure enough, I go back, I play Legend of Max, I hold onto the bar this time, I got like 15 seconds further than I usually do.

1716
02:07:39,496 --> 02:07:39,996
[SPEAKER_15]: Go figure.

1717
02:07:40,556 --> 02:07:42,196
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, thank you, my recent accomplishment.

1718
02:07:45,037 --> 02:07:46,337
[SPEAKER_00]: I am two-fisting the mics.

1719
02:07:48,077 --> 02:07:49,938
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did you give me a mic and Rob gave me a mic?

1720
02:07:49,958 --> 02:07:50,558
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got both mics.

1721
02:07:50,578 --> 02:07:50,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Take

1722
02:07:58,223 --> 02:07:58,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Dead Air.

1723
02:08:01,005 --> 02:08:03,867
[SPEAKER_15]: You always... Well, they always have to rely on me to bring up a topic.

1724
02:08:03,907 --> 02:08:07,269
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, anything... Anybody else want to say anything about Bar... It's not my show.

1725
02:08:07,309 --> 02:08:10,231
[SPEAKER_15]: It's three people here, and all you guys are here, too.

1726
02:08:10,251 --> 02:08:11,392
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, I brought up the topic.

1727
02:08:11,432 --> 02:08:11,992
[SPEAKER_15]: That's right.

1728
02:08:13,473 --> 02:08:16,095
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie's researching our next topic, so it's up to you guys.

1729
02:08:17,916 --> 02:08:19,617
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I just have to sit here and look pretty.

1730
02:08:20,758 --> 02:08:20,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1731
02:08:22,459 --> 02:08:22,959
[SPEAKER_15]: New topic.

1732
02:08:23,220 --> 02:08:23,520
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1733
02:08:24,525 --> 02:08:27,748
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to go with this year and pretty much last year.

1734
02:08:27,788 --> 02:08:30,050
[SPEAKER_15]: This year I've noticed a lot of trends changing.

1735
02:08:30,490 --> 02:08:32,652
[SPEAKER_15]: This is just like pop culture trends.

1736
02:08:33,192 --> 02:08:39,437
[SPEAKER_15]: Example, before I used to make all these AIDS jokes, like you're going to get AIDS.

1737
02:08:40,258 --> 02:08:41,759
[SPEAKER_15]: SARS is the AIDS of 2003.

1738
02:08:46,087 --> 02:08:48,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Sars is not a joke.

1739
02:08:48,549 --> 02:08:54,233
[SPEAKER_15]: We laughed so hard just over making Sars jokes during the whole trip.

1740
02:08:54,333 --> 02:08:54,934
[SPEAKER_15]: It was great.

1741
02:08:56,255 --> 02:08:59,557
[SPEAKER_15]: So, is there any other pop culture changes you want to address?

1742
02:08:59,597 --> 02:09:02,079
[SPEAKER_15]: There was another one, but I can't remember it right now.

1743
02:09:02,179 --> 02:09:03,700
[SPEAKER_15]: When you think of it, you bring it up, okay?

1744
02:09:04,160 --> 02:09:04,461
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1745
02:09:04,561 --> 02:09:06,122
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, in the meantime, Janae has a story.

1746
02:09:07,068 --> 02:09:13,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I had this really weird story to tell, because just thinking of stars for a minute, it just made me think of something.

1747
02:09:13,573 --> 02:09:15,434
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to the mall the other day, and I went to the store.

1748
02:09:15,814 --> 02:09:18,016
[SPEAKER_03]: And as soon as I walked in the store, I started coughing really bad.

1749
02:09:18,096 --> 02:09:19,837
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, oh my god, what's going on?

1750
02:09:20,218 --> 02:09:21,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was like an anthrax attack.

1751
02:09:22,579 --> 02:09:25,121
[SPEAKER_03]: And walking through the store, walking through, everybody's coughing.

1752
02:09:25,461 --> 02:09:26,662
[SPEAKER_15]: No, anthrax was last year.

1753
02:09:26,842 --> 02:09:28,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anthrax was the year before last.

1754
02:09:28,443 --> 02:09:31,746
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyways, but still, I was like, what the hell is going on?

1755
02:09:32,306 --> 02:09:33,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Come to find out.

1756
02:09:33,649 --> 02:09:40,614
[SPEAKER_03]: This kid that's at his cash register pepper sprayed his boss on accident because he didn't know that the thing was full and he was messing around with it.

1757
02:09:40,975 --> 02:09:43,256
[SPEAKER_03]: And it infected the whole store with pepper spray.

1758
02:09:43,757 --> 02:09:51,382
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that was really interesting to watch that and see the little, like, rent-a-cops come in and be like, We've got to confiscate your pepper spray.

1759
02:09:53,264 --> 02:09:54,905
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody was... Did they say it just like that?

1760
02:09:55,225 --> 02:09:57,447
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got to confiscate your pepper spray!

1761
02:09:58,948 --> 02:09:59,148
[SPEAKER_03]: No...

1762
02:10:00,726 --> 02:10:05,428
[SPEAKER_03]: No, basically they have Krispy Kreme in one hand and say, we're going to complicate your pepper spray.

1763
02:10:06,528 --> 02:10:07,809
[SPEAKER_15]: My donut is peppery.

1764
02:10:08,549 --> 02:10:09,590
[SPEAKER_15]: Coughing, go.

1765
02:10:10,370 --> 02:10:12,091
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, is Jamie right?

1766
02:10:12,111 --> 02:10:17,653
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you want to, just before we get over to Mad Libs, do you want to introduce yourself for our listeners?

1767
02:10:21,274 --> 02:10:22,575
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you want to introduce yourself for our listeners?

1768
02:10:22,955 --> 02:10:25,176
[SPEAKER_03]: How do I introduce myself to your listeners?

1769
02:10:25,336 --> 02:10:29,558
[SPEAKER_12]: Tell them your online name and give them a quick personal ad because we know you're available.

1770
02:10:30,983 --> 02:10:32,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how true that is.

1771
02:10:32,984 --> 02:10:34,085

[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Pixie Dust, and I'm 20.

1774
02:10:37,807 --> 02:10:39,749
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm too damn old, is what I think.

1775
02:10:39,849 --> 02:10:43,991
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm looking at a picture of me holding up a McDonald's apple pie.

1776
02:10:44,031 --> 02:10:45,052
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I'm sexy.

[SPEAKER_13]: Apple pie going straight to my thigh.

1779
02:10:50,235 --> 02:10:52,617
[SPEAKER_03]: You know you want some of this Southern Fried Thigh.

1780
02:10:52,657 --> 02:10:53,757
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that already.

1781
02:10:54,938 --> 02:10:57,880
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a little stupid and wacko, so, yeah.

1782
02:10:58,420 --> 02:10:59,521
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I gotta live on me.

1783
02:11:02,102 --> 02:11:03,644
[SPEAKER_15]: You had a quick thought, Loki, before we get to Madlib?

1784
02:11:04,305 --> 02:11:04,605
[SPEAKER_15]: I did.

[SPEAKER_15]: My friend was on TV because he was the only UC student to stay over in China during the whole SARS thing while everyone else came home.

[SPEAKER_15]: His name was Eric Fong.

1791
02:11:22,101 --> 02:11:29,144
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're in the Sacramento area and you happen to be watching News 3 at 11 a couple days ago, you probably saw him.

1792
02:11:29,705 --> 02:11:30,745
[SPEAKER_15]: His name is Eric Fong.

1793
02:11:30,805 --> 02:11:33,426

1794
02:11:34,347 --> 02:11:35,247
[SPEAKER_15]: Aww, it's so precious.

1795
02:11:35,327 --> 02:11:38,829

1796
02:11:39,548 --> 02:11:40,408
[SPEAKER_15]: How's this going to work, Jamie?

1797
02:11:40,509 --> 02:11:41,389
[SPEAKER_15]: Give Jamie a mic.

1798
02:11:44,791 --> 02:11:48,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, I'm going to tell you whether or not to say a verb, noun, adjective, whatever.

1799
02:11:49,193 --> 02:11:49,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1800
02:11:50,053 --> 02:11:52,334
[SPEAKER_05]: You suggest one, you go around the room, everyone's suggesting one.

[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1802
02:11:53,255 --> 02:11:54,856
[SPEAKER_05]: One by one, and then we'll read you the story.

1803
02:11:54,896 --> 02:12:03,660
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, this particular one, I'm not even going to give you the title or anything of what it is, but you get to find out what it is you're butchering after you put in the words.

1804
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:05,561
[SPEAKER_15]: So should they be Bomani-related words?

1805
02:12:06,582 --> 02:12:07,542
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not necessarily.

1806
02:12:07,782 --> 02:12:08,563

1813
02:12:18,594 --> 02:12:20,954
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, you better hold onto a mic, Jamie, and we'll pass around the other one.

1814
02:12:21,734 --> 02:12:24,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, let me do... Hold the mic in my cleavage.

02:24:42,419 --> 02:24:46,902
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a BWL, actually it's a song I found on Bomani Sims.

2069
02:24:47,523 --> 02:24:53,607
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a remix of Era called the Era Grand Blue, or it's Grand Blue, the Era Outset Mix.

2070
02:24:54,567 --> 02:24:57,549
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's pretty sweet, so check it out.

2071
02:24:57,629 --> 02:24:58,450
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you guys will like it.

2072
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:21,240
Thank you for watching!

2073
02:25:49,609 --> 02:25:51,390
Thank you for watching!

2074
02:27:32,961 --> 02:27:33,309
Thank you.

2075
02:29:14,055 --> 02:29:18,319
Okay, now we're also going to play something.

2076
02:29:18,339 --> 02:29:21,802
Loki, you want to introduce this, what you just told me to play?

2077
02:29:21,862 --> 02:29:22,162
Okay.

2078
02:29:39,983 --> 02:29:41,404
[SPEAKER_15]: Gravity Reloaded Dread Rock

2079
02:30:00,546 --> 02:30:13,012
[SPEAKER_15]: Still accepting questions for Ask Orange Lounge via the chat room or our email, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com So send those questions in and we'll be right back after this brand new Loki remix, Gravity Reloaded, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2080
02:31:43,221 --> 02:31:43,887
Thank you for watching!

2081
02:33:15,148 --> 02:33:15,568
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello?

2082
02:33:16,369 --> 02:33:16,629
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello?

2083
02:33:16,689 --> 02:33:17,370
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this thing on?

2084
02:33:17,430 --> 02:33:17,950
[SPEAKER_15]: Testing.

2085
02:33:19,091 --> 02:33:19,872
[SPEAKER_15]: Testing 1-2.

2086
02:33:20,432 --> 02:33:24,396
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

2087
02:33:24,496 --> 02:33:24,976
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello?

2088
02:33:25,637 --> 02:33:27,098
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't understand this.

2089
02:33:27,638 --> 02:33:28,479
[SPEAKER_15]: Does this thing work?

2090
02:33:28,499 --> 02:33:30,080
[SPEAKER_05]: This thing reads like stereo instructions.

2091
02:33:30,161 --> 02:33:30,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this on?

2092
02:33:30,781 --> 02:33:31,382
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell?

2093
02:33:33,924 --> 02:33:35,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge Radio.

2094
02:33:35,525 --> 02:33:37,707
[SPEAKER_15]: Broke down Get Open Money Radio.

2095
02:33:37,727 --> 02:33:38,848
[SPEAKER_15]: What the f***?

2096
02:33:40,089 --> 02:33:41,050
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome back, everybody.

2097
02:33:42,205 --> 02:33:44,570
[SPEAKER_15]: It's time for everybody's favorite part of Orange Lounge.

2098
02:33:45,272 --> 02:33:47,055
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the part where the chatroom really gets to participate.

2099
02:33:47,576 --> 02:33:49,039
[SPEAKER_15]: It's Ask Orange Lounge!

2100
02:33:50,373 --> 02:33:53,335
[SPEAKER_15]: Tonight you can ask Orange Lounge, that would be myself, DarkSakura, or Loki.

2101
02:33:53,855 --> 02:33:54,915
[SPEAKER_15]: Or you could ask Marin.

2102
02:33:55,336 --> 02:33:56,876
[SPEAKER_15]: You could ask Pixie Dust.

2103
02:33:57,297 --> 02:34:00,478
[SPEAKER_15]: You could ask, well Nelly's probably not going to talk to you, but you could try asking her.

2104
02:34:01,419 --> 02:34:02,940
[SPEAKER_15]: You could ask Brad, Irene.

2105
02:34:03,720 --> 02:34:07,182
[SPEAKER_15]: You could ask Navi, but he probably won't talk to you either because he's setting up for Orange Crush.

2106
02:34:07,602 --> 02:34:10,484
[SPEAKER_15]: Or you could ask DDR Angel and Magus, quite the cute couple over there.

2107
02:34:11,884 --> 02:34:14,206
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, let's get to the first questions, shall we?

2108
02:34:16,427 --> 02:34:18,608
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's ask your ass, how are you feeling today?

2109
02:34:20,609 --> 02:34:23,091
[SPEAKER_15]: That had a maturity level of like three.

2110
02:34:25,252 --> 02:34:29,975
[SPEAKER_15]: First question from DJ Tyrant wants to know, when can I come up and be a guest on the show?

2111
02:34:30,055 --> 02:34:30,715
[SPEAKER_15]: That's my question.

2112
02:34:31,135 --> 02:34:33,417
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, when can you get in your car and drive?

2113
02:34:33,857 --> 02:34:38,120
[SPEAKER_15]: Plus, you know, I don't know, I feel weird about having strangers in the house.

2114
02:34:38,140 --> 02:34:45,604
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, of course it worked before, because I didn't know Angel before she came up here to be on the show, so... Tyrant's not the only one that said he wants to be on the show, though.

2115
02:34:45,904 --> 02:34:46,945
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's my recommendation to you.

2116
02:34:47,365 --> 02:34:48,446
[SPEAKER_15]: Come to a tournament...

2117
02:34:49,326 --> 02:34:54,469
[SPEAKER_15]: Come to a tournament, like, you know, we'll be... I'm sure at least one of the three of us will be at Cyber Beat Nation 2.

2118
02:34:55,490 --> 02:34:58,112
[SPEAKER_15]: Or come to us at a tournament, get to know us there.

2119
02:34:58,632 --> 02:34:59,853
[SPEAKER_15]: Or just come.

2120
02:35:00,353 --> 02:35:00,974
[SPEAKER_15]: Or just come.

2121
02:35:02,094 --> 02:35:04,796
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, once we get to know you, okay, come on a show.

2122
02:35:07,157 --> 02:35:07,578
[SPEAKER_15]: That's my...

2123
02:35:08,840 --> 02:35:15,706
[SPEAKER_15]: That's my biggest recommendation to you, though, is come to a tournament and get warmed up to the show first, because that's an easy way to be on the show.

2124
02:35:16,066 --> 02:35:18,548
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't have to sit here and be bored in the studio like everyone else.

2125
02:35:18,948 --> 02:35:19,209
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

2126
02:35:20,950 --> 02:35:22,651
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's get to the next question from Ninst.

2127
02:35:23,272 --> 02:35:27,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Ninst would like to know, what is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?

2128
02:35:27,255 --> 02:35:29,137
[SPEAKER_15]: Forty-two.

2129
02:35:29,197 --> 02:35:30,058
[SPEAKER_15]: Forty-two, says Mary.

2130
02:35:30,338 --> 02:35:31,159
[SPEAKER_15]: Forty-two, says Jamie.

2131
02:35:31,979 --> 02:35:33,140
[SPEAKER_15]: Sixty-nine, says Skye.

2132
02:35:33,460 --> 02:35:33,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Thirty-seven.

2133
02:35:37,631 --> 02:35:38,832
[SPEAKER_15]: Janae might have a serious answer.

2134
02:35:40,854 --> 02:35:41,394
[SPEAKER_03]: My ass.

2135
02:35:42,535 --> 02:35:43,135
[SPEAKER_15]: Your ass.

2136
02:35:43,195 --> 02:35:44,496
[SPEAKER_15]: That's wonderful.

2137
02:35:44,536 --> 02:35:45,637
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the second person.

2138
02:35:46,418 --> 02:35:47,739
[SPEAKER_05]: The meaning of life really is 42.

2139
02:35:48,419 --> 02:35:50,941
[SPEAKER_05]: The earth was constructed to solve the riddle of the meaning of life.

2140
02:35:51,442 --> 02:35:55,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, it was destroyed before it could finish the computation, so it came up with 42.

2141
02:35:56,466 --> 02:35:58,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the purpose of life is easy.

2142
02:35:59,468 --> 02:36:00,889
[SPEAKER_05]: The purpose of life is not dying.

2143
02:36:02,751 --> 02:36:03,531
[SPEAKER_13]: The purpose of life.

2144
02:36:03,731 --> 02:36:04,212
[SPEAKER_13]: Breathe in.

2145
02:36:04,512 --> 02:36:05,032
[SPEAKER_13]: Breathe out.

2146
02:36:05,333 --> 02:36:05,693
[SPEAKER_13]: Repeat.

2147
02:36:07,768 --> 02:36:09,389
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a serious answer to this question.

2148
02:36:09,469 --> 02:36:10,310
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you people handle it?

2149
02:36:10,831 --> 02:36:11,111
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2150
02:36:12,472 --> 02:36:13,233
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I'm going to try.

2151
02:36:13,253 --> 02:36:16,096
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to try a serious answer to this question.

2152
02:36:16,576 --> 02:36:20,560
[SPEAKER_15]: The meaning of life is to experience every possible emotion possible.

2153
02:36:22,182 --> 02:36:23,884
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not an awe.

2154
02:36:23,944 --> 02:36:25,766
[SPEAKER_15]: That's like death can be one of those.

2155
02:36:26,266 --> 02:36:27,167
[SPEAKER_05]: I still think the answer is 42.

2156
02:36:27,287 --> 02:36:27,467
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 42.

2157
02:36:30,583 --> 02:36:31,544
[SPEAKER_15]: I feel deathly ill.

2158
02:36:31,844 --> 02:36:34,126
[SPEAKER_15]: I woke up the other day and I went, ah, I'm deathly ill.

2159
02:36:35,027 --> 02:36:35,307
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

2160
02:36:36,368 --> 02:36:38,830
[SPEAKER_15]: That's, that's... You know what's funny?

2161
02:36:39,290 --> 02:36:40,872
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm experiencing vomit from that.

2162
02:36:40,912 --> 02:36:42,713
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what the meaning of life is?

2163
02:36:43,173 --> 02:36:46,917
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, actually, you'll never know because once you figure out the meaning of life, that's when you die.

2164
02:36:48,278 --> 02:36:50,960
[SPEAKER_15]: See, so if you ever do figure out the meaning of life, you will die.

2165
02:36:51,360 --> 02:36:52,921
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why no one has ever figured it out.

2166
02:36:53,502 --> 02:36:55,704
[SPEAKER_05]: The meaning of, ah, shit, dead...

2167
02:36:59,072 --> 02:37:00,373
[SPEAKER_03]: The meaning of my life is cake.

2168
02:37:00,593 --> 02:37:01,854
[SPEAKER_15]: Second question from Nance.

2169
02:37:02,415 --> 02:37:06,658
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you taken part in practicing towel day, which is today, May 25th?

2170
02:37:07,058 --> 02:37:08,539
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell is towel day?

2171
02:37:08,639 --> 02:37:09,700
[SPEAKER_15]: Today is towel day.

2172
02:37:10,140 --> 02:37:10,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I have.

2173
02:37:10,820 --> 02:37:11,781
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a towel on my head.

2174
02:37:11,821 --> 02:37:12,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

2175
02:37:14,223 --> 02:37:15,544
[SPEAKER_03]: A towel touched my boobs today.

2176
02:37:18,206 --> 02:37:20,007
[SPEAKER_05]: I took a shower, I had to dry off.

2177
02:37:20,327 --> 02:37:24,130
[SPEAKER_15]: I heard some scandalous about towels in the shower just a little while ago.

2178
02:37:24,510 --> 02:37:29,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't use towels, I use those hand dryer things, I like bought one and it's on my wall.

2179
02:37:29,554 --> 02:37:32,516
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, what do you do, you just kind of like straddle the dryer?

2180
02:37:32,856 --> 02:37:35,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, it's an industrial one so I straddle the dryer.

2181
02:37:35,498 --> 02:37:36,999
[SPEAKER_15]: It's towel day, does he know?

2182
02:37:39,040 --> 02:37:41,022
[SPEAKER_15]: That's awful, I hope you get beat for that.

2183
02:37:42,162 --> 02:37:42,903
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, moving on.

2184
02:37:43,999 --> 02:37:45,760
[SPEAKER_15]: Next question from John Fields.

2185
02:37:47,021 --> 02:37:49,743
[SPEAKER_15]: Just how many people in California have SARS?

2186
02:37:50,463 --> 02:37:55,286
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to be on the show when I visit California, but if SARS is a problem, I may wait for next summer to visit.

2187
02:37:56,767 --> 02:37:58,888
[SPEAKER_05]: That's got to be the dumbest question I've ever heard.

2188
02:38:00,249 --> 02:38:00,869
[SPEAKER_15]: Why is that?

2189
02:38:01,250 --> 02:38:07,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Because anyone who's been in America who's gotten SARS has gotten treatment for it and are, like, better.

2190
02:38:08,094 --> 02:38:09,435
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was a joke.

2191
02:38:10,695 --> 02:38:11,116
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

2192
02:38:11,136 --> 02:38:12,717
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not Toronto, so get over it.

2193
02:38:14,720 --> 02:38:17,783
[SPEAKER_15]: Toronto is just trying to be special because they're Canadian.

2194
02:38:18,283 --> 02:38:22,667
[SPEAKER_15]: They're just like, look at us, we're Chinese, sort of.

2195
02:38:23,448 --> 02:38:24,229
[SPEAKER_15]: We have SARS.

2196
02:38:25,270 --> 02:38:25,910
[SPEAKER_15]: We're SARS-y.

2197
02:38:27,532 --> 02:38:28,613
[SPEAKER_03]: We got SARS-ay.

2198
02:38:28,853 --> 02:38:30,274
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, moving on.

2199
02:38:31,035 --> 02:38:31,595
[SPEAKER_15]: Black Lab.

2200
02:38:31,776 --> 02:38:36,220
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, excellent question from Black Lab referring to the chat room earlier this week.

2201
02:38:36,800 --> 02:38:38,642
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, we have to get an answer from everybody on this.

2202
02:38:39,998 --> 02:38:47,026
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you ever been to that point where you were just so hungry, you are so deathly hungry, you would just do anything?

2203
02:38:47,306 --> 02:38:50,449
[SPEAKER_15]: The question from Black Lab, would you give a blowjob for a pizza?

2204
02:38:51,190 --> 02:38:51,951
[SPEAKER_03]: He never done that!

2205
02:38:54,918 --> 02:38:56,019
[SPEAKER_15]: Notice how I don't contest it.

2206
02:38:57,040 --> 02:38:59,762
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't give a blowjob for any reason because it's nasty.

2207
02:39:01,364 --> 02:39:04,927
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, but it's the whole concept of putting your mouth where someone pisses from.

2208
02:39:06,388 --> 02:39:10,131
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would probably say that what I would do instead is get in my car and go buy one.

2209
02:39:12,493 --> 02:39:13,574
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's say you don't have any money.

2210
02:39:14,855 --> 02:39:16,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I would kill someone for pizza.

2211
02:39:17,097 --> 02:39:18,118
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would never blow them.

2212
02:39:19,859 --> 02:39:20,640
[SPEAKER_15]: Anybody else want to comment?

2213
02:39:21,641 --> 02:39:22,601
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with Jamie.

2214
02:39:22,641 --> 02:39:23,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2215
02:39:24,582 --> 02:39:27,503
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I'd receive one for pizza, then I'd have blowjob pizza.

2216
02:39:29,044 --> 02:39:29,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.

2217
02:39:30,144 --> 02:39:30,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2218
02:39:30,885 --> 02:39:33,686
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's an excellent plug for our forums right here.

2219
02:39:33,786 --> 02:39:38,107
[SPEAKER_15]: Visit www.caliabomani.com slash NBOR3 where our forums are.

2220
02:39:38,528 --> 02:39:42,329
[SPEAKER_15]: And Zero put an excellent answer to this question earlier this week, so go read it.

2221
02:39:44,170 --> 02:39:48,892
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's change this show from Orange Lounge to Dick Haters because...

2222
02:39:50,430 --> 02:39:52,350
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't hate... Hey, uh-uh, uh-uh.

2223
02:39:52,550 --> 02:39:54,971
[SPEAKER_00]: We ain't... Dick-hating feminazis.

2224
02:39:54,991 --> 02:39:55,531
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.

2225
02:39:55,591 --> 02:39:57,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2226
02:39:57,732 --> 02:40:00,992
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't... It's not that I hate the dick.

2227
02:40:02,373 --> 02:40:04,633
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just I don't find it particularly appetizing.

2228
02:40:04,673 --> 02:40:05,853
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me put it this way.

2229
02:40:06,173 --> 02:40:09,214
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, to Jamie, dick is like a teddy bear.

2230
02:40:09,234 --> 02:40:13,215
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, you can fluff it and play with it and hug it and squeeze it, but you're not going to eat it.

2231
02:40:14,691 --> 02:40:16,212
[SPEAKER_15]: You put it in your cooch?

2232
02:40:18,193 --> 02:40:19,773
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, dick is foreign.

2233
02:40:20,033 --> 02:40:23,895
[SPEAKER_03]: It is so foreign, it's like Japan, so I don't know where it is.

2234
02:40:24,415 --> 02:40:24,975
[SPEAKER_03]: So foreign.

2235
02:40:25,296 --> 02:40:26,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's revise this.

2236
02:40:26,616 --> 02:40:27,496
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's revise this.

2237
02:40:28,077 --> 02:40:29,577
[SPEAKER_13]: What would you do for a Klondike bar?

2238
02:40:30,878 --> 02:40:32,419
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's chocolate, that's different.

2239
02:40:32,539 --> 02:40:33,459
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, moving on.

2240
02:40:33,479 --> 02:40:35,560
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you do for an Oreo Klondike bar?

2241
02:40:35,600 --> 02:40:36,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

2242
02:40:36,420 --> 02:40:39,021
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to get through these AskCourseLounge questions.

2243
02:40:39,061 --> 02:40:40,042
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, here we go.

2244
02:40:40,202 --> 02:40:40,482
[SPEAKER_15]: Here we go.

2245
02:40:41,804 --> 02:40:46,566
[SPEAKER_15]: I just heard, oh, this is from CrashOverride003, as opposed to 0070s003.

2246
02:40:46,826 --> 02:40:48,787
[SPEAKER_15]: He or she, sorry.

2247
02:40:49,387 --> 02:40:53,729
[SPEAKER_15]: I just heard that DDR Extreme is the last arcade game for the DDR series.

2248
02:40:53,869 --> 02:40:54,549
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, that old rumor.

2249
02:40:55,209 --> 02:40:55,889
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this true?

2250
02:40:56,810 --> 02:40:57,430
[SPEAKER_05]: That old rumor.

2251
02:40:58,170 --> 02:41:01,892
[SPEAKER_15]: If it is the last, will be complete BS.

2252
02:41:03,492 --> 02:41:04,673
[SPEAKER_05]: And, again, that old rumor.

2253
02:41:05,833 --> 02:41:07,034
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what, this is my thought.

2254
02:41:07,054 --> 02:41:08,534
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, there is no definitive answer.

2255
02:41:08,714 --> 02:41:10,255
[SPEAKER_15]: If we knew the definitive answer, we'd tell you.

2256
02:41:12,148 --> 02:41:13,569
[SPEAKER_15]: I have the definitive answer.

2257
02:41:14,449 --> 02:41:15,229
[SPEAKER_15]: Who gives a shit?

2258
02:41:15,269 --> 02:41:16,109
[SPEAKER_15]: This DDR sucks.

2259
02:41:17,049 --> 02:41:17,429
[SPEAKER_15]: Shut up.

2260
02:41:18,810 --> 02:41:19,750
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's not the last one.

2261
02:41:19,770 --> 02:41:21,110
[SPEAKER_15]: The next one will be the last one.

2262
02:41:21,450 --> 02:41:24,871
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're going to continue it on the console because DDR is not popular in Japan.

2263
02:41:24,911 --> 02:41:25,591
[SPEAKER_15]: Popular music is.

2264
02:41:26,551 --> 02:41:28,012
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's my thought on it.

2265
02:41:28,512 --> 02:41:30,372
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as the USA is concerned, it's true.

2266
02:41:30,592 --> 02:41:32,913
[SPEAKER_15]: There's probably not going to be any other USA machines.

2267
02:41:33,153 --> 02:41:34,513
[SPEAKER_15]: It's pretty much a home only thing.

2268
02:41:35,053 --> 02:41:36,554
[SPEAKER_15]: Japan, nobody really knows.

2269
02:41:36,614 --> 02:41:37,454
[SPEAKER_15]: But here's my thought.

2270
02:41:38,243 --> 02:41:41,765
[SPEAKER_15]: It's probably the last version of DDR in its current form.

2271
02:41:41,865 --> 02:41:46,567
[SPEAKER_15]: If they do another DDR, it's going to be like DDR DX type thing.

2272
02:41:46,707 --> 02:41:47,827
[SPEAKER_15]: That's my honest opinion on it.

2273
02:41:48,808 --> 02:41:50,248
[SPEAKER_05]: So we get Technomotion, I see.

2274
02:41:50,728 --> 02:41:51,069
[SPEAKER_15]: Hopefully.

2275
02:41:51,849 --> 02:41:52,049
[SPEAKER_15]: Not.

2276
02:41:52,269 --> 02:41:52,529
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

2277
02:41:54,410 --> 02:41:54,850
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see.

2278
02:41:55,010 --> 02:41:56,391
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, second part of this question.

2279
02:41:56,671 --> 02:41:59,672
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, and when are they going to fire Naoki and replace him?

2280
02:41:59,732 --> 02:42:02,153
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of his material is just plain shit now these days.

2281
02:42:02,213 --> 02:42:05,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't you know that they clone Naoki every year and keep using his clones?

2282
02:42:08,470 --> 02:42:08,850
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

2283
02:42:09,711 --> 02:42:14,413
[SPEAKER_15]: I do notice that Extreme kind of had less Naoki tracks than usual, but I don't think.

2284
02:42:14,693 --> 02:42:17,454
[SPEAKER_15]: He's still doing music for 2DX and all that, so he's still around.

2285
02:42:17,554 --> 02:42:20,376
[SPEAKER_05]: From what I understand, isn't he also actually working on Gradius?

2286
02:42:20,796 --> 02:42:21,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Gradius 5?

2287
02:42:21,236 --> 02:42:22,997
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, he's got things to do.

2288
02:42:24,478 --> 02:42:24,738
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

2289
02:42:26,219 --> 02:42:29,280
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so I'm going to cut off the question submission now.

2290
02:42:29,360 --> 02:42:32,282
[SPEAKER_15]: So I've got four questions left to burn through here, and then we're going to get to Orange Crush.

2291
02:42:32,742 --> 02:42:33,022
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

2292
02:42:33,973 --> 02:42:37,715
[SPEAKER_15]: KeenMaker in Exile wants to know, oh, that's not a question.

2293
02:42:37,775 --> 02:42:39,195
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, okay, good question, I guess.

2294
02:42:39,596 --> 02:42:41,636
[SPEAKER_15]: Why the fuck do I live so far away?

2295
02:42:42,637 --> 02:42:45,158
[SPEAKER_15]: That's actually zero under another name.

2296
02:42:46,379 --> 02:42:47,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you do.

2297
02:42:47,739 --> 02:42:51,241
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it's closer to my work, so thusly everybody else must suffer because I'm lazy.

2298
02:42:52,761 --> 02:42:56,983
[SPEAKER_15]: DJ Tyrant would like to know, would just like to say that he'll be there at CBN too.

2299
02:42:57,043 --> 02:42:57,343
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2300
02:42:59,865 --> 02:43:02,786
[SPEAKER_15]: Ninst would like to know, what would Jesus do for a Klondike bar?

2301
02:43:03,598 --> 02:43:04,558
[SPEAKER_05]: He'd die for your sins.

2302
02:43:07,280 --> 02:43:08,881
[SPEAKER_15]: What would Jesus do for a Klondike bar?

2303
02:43:09,121 --> 02:43:09,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Die for your sins.

2304
02:43:11,942 --> 02:43:14,023
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought you said something about five cents.

2305
02:43:14,083 --> 02:43:14,763
[SPEAKER_15]: Die five cents.

2306
02:43:15,984 --> 02:43:17,245
[SPEAKER_15]: He'd just, you know, hang around.

2307
02:43:17,265 --> 02:43:20,026
[SPEAKER_05]: He'd pick up a piece of shit and turn it into a Klondike bar.

2308
02:43:24,548 --> 02:43:26,149
[SPEAKER_15]: Jesus would blow the pizza man.

2309
02:43:29,050 --> 02:43:29,791
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, okay.

2310
02:43:31,004 --> 02:43:31,945
[SPEAKER_15]: It came from FuzzyHalf

2311
02:43:48,757 --> 02:43:50,058
[SPEAKER_05]: from Dracona's Daughter.

2312
02:43:51,258 --> 02:43:54,480
[SPEAKER_05]: She was at a DDR tournament and said, this DDR sucks.

2313
02:43:54,880 --> 02:43:55,140
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

2314
02:43:55,481 --> 02:43:56,461
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.

2315
02:43:56,581 --> 02:43:58,382
[SPEAKER_15]: Was that at CVGL or was that at... It was Lily.

2316
02:43:58,922 --> 02:44:02,064
[SPEAKER_15]: I know it was Lily that said it, but was that at CVGL or was that at the Mountain Mike's one?

2317
02:44:02,284 --> 02:44:02,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Mountain Mike's.

2318
02:44:02,744 --> 02:44:03,625
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was the Mountain Mike's one.

2319
02:44:04,305 --> 02:44:07,147
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought it was from, what was it, that huge tournament?

2320
02:44:07,167 --> 02:44:07,647
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was TVGL.

2321
02:44:07,927 --> 02:44:16,291
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought it was that huge SoCal tournament or whatever that they were competing for freestyle or whatever, and it was for the Solo Machine.

2322
02:44:16,311 --> 02:44:17,932
[SPEAKER_15]: That was Solo Sucks anyway.

2323
02:44:17,952 --> 02:44:18,872
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Solo Sucks anyway.

2324
02:44:18,992 --> 02:44:19,653
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the other one.

2325
02:44:20,233 --> 02:44:28,057
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, this DDR Sucks came from... It was TVGL because we did the Step Squad thing at Mount Lykes, the promo at Mount Lykes.

2326
02:44:28,777 --> 02:44:29,517
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, okay.

2327
02:44:29,557 --> 02:44:30,718
[SPEAKER_05]: She didn't kill, I went.

2328
02:44:30,878 --> 02:44:33,959
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought it was the same day that you guys had done that promo, but it was she didn't kill one.

2329
02:44:33,979 --> 02:44:34,679
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was before.

2330
02:44:34,959 --> 02:44:36,700
[SPEAKER_05]: We tried to get her to say it again and she wouldn't.

2331
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:37,920
[SPEAKER_15]: Either way, I wasn't there.

2332
02:44:38,900 --> 02:44:39,220
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

2333
02:44:40,541 --> 02:44:43,782
[SPEAKER_15]: So, now it's time for Orange Crush.

2334
02:44:44,322 --> 02:44:47,143
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Irene, who's competing in Orange Crush today?

2335
02:44:50,224 --> 02:44:52,464
[SPEAKER_15]: If it's about pop and music, I say it's me versus Jamie.

2336
02:44:53,185 --> 02:44:54,345
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, you have it.

2337
02:44:56,720 --> 02:44:58,921
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, hold on, I've got to get the theme music.

2338
02:45:00,042 --> 02:45:01,402
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's listen to Jamie's elbow.

2339
02:45:01,562 --> 02:45:03,883
[SPEAKER_15]: Hold on, now it's time for Orange Crush, we have to play the theme music.

2340
02:45:07,724 --> 02:45:10,425
[SPEAKER_15]: Now it's time for Orange Crush.

2341
02:45:10,946 --> 02:45:13,627
[SPEAKER_15]: Now it's time for Orange Crush.

2342
02:45:13,867 --> 02:45:16,048
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

2343
02:45:17,668 --> 02:45:19,209
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, Irene, take it away.

2344
02:45:19,369 --> 02:45:19,609
[SPEAKER_15]: You can...

2345
02:45:23,175 --> 02:45:24,416
[SPEAKER_15]: Do I need to leave the room then first?

2346
02:45:24,676 --> 02:45:25,236
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

2347
02:45:25,256 --> 02:45:28,177
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell them about the topic and stuff, and somebody else needs to time.

2348
02:45:28,197 --> 02:45:31,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Can somebody time for me, please?

2349
02:45:33,358 --> 02:45:36,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Garrett, go keep him company since you know all the answers to the questions anyway.

2350
02:45:36,459 --> 02:45:38,140
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I know shit about pop music.

2351
02:45:38,160 --> 02:45:39,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody have a watch?

2352
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:39,500
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll keep time.

2353
02:45:39,540 --> 02:45:40,381
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 30 seconds.

2354
02:45:40,581 --> 02:45:41,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you do that?

2355
02:45:43,042 --> 02:45:44,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody can count to 30?

2356
02:45:44,722 --> 02:45:45,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, cool.

2357
02:45:45,782 --> 02:45:46,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Just let me know.

2358
02:45:46,503 --> 02:45:46,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2359
02:45:47,023 --> 02:45:47,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2360
02:45:47,901 --> 02:45:51,465
[SPEAKER_02]: The theme for tonight is called Five Button Mode.

2361
02:46:05,977 --> 02:46:17,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Which song from Guitar Freaks 9 and Drum Mini 8 came from Poppin' Music 8?

2362
02:46:18,342 --> 02:46:21,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Which Poppin' Music artist is getting the newest Artist Collection CD?

2363
02:46:24,924 --> 02:46:29,826
[SPEAKER_02]: In Poppin' Music 7, the song Platonic Love is done by Nard, who is better known by which alias?

2364
02:46:31,195 --> 02:46:31,495
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2365
02:46:31,815 --> 02:46:32,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2366
02:46:32,455 --> 02:46:35,036

[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go over the answers.

2429
02:48:59,797 --> 02:49:00,617
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go over the answers.

2430
02:49:00,697 --> 02:49:01,558

2431
02:49:01,598 --> 02:49:04,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Which song from Guitar Freaks 9 and Drum Mini 8 came from Poppin' Music 8?

2433
02:49:07,122 --> 02:49:06,161

2434
02:49:07,402 --> 02:49:08,283
[SPEAKER_15]: You know how I knew that?

2435
02:49:08,303 --> 02:49:10,284
[SPEAKER_15]: Because that's in rotation on Orange Laundry Radio.

2436
02:49:10,404 --> 02:49:10,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

2437
02:49:11,125 --> 02:49:12,066

2438
02:49:12,106 --> 02:49:15,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Which Poppin' Music artist is getting the newest artist collection CD?

2439
02:49:15,068 --> 02:49:16,229
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me think about this one a little longer.

2440
02:49:16,469 --> 02:49:18,410
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a Poppin' Music artist getting a collection CD.

2441
02:49:19,051 --> 02:49:19,131
[SPEAKER_15]: Um...

2442
02:49:21,471 --> 02:49:25,212
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just trying to think of the artists that have a lot of songs in pop and music.

2443
02:49:25,392 --> 02:49:27,793
[SPEAKER_15]: I would... The classic?

2444
02:49:27,913 --> 02:49:28,814
[SPEAKER_02]: The classical ones?

2445
02:49:28,894 --> 02:49:36,036
[SPEAKER_02]: It's either going to be A, Des Rho, B, Hideo Sua, or C, Parkets?

2446
02:49:36,116 --> 02:49:38,097
[SPEAKER_15]: I would actually say, before I say Des Rho, I'd say Hideo Sua.

2447
02:49:38,897 --> 02:49:39,738
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's Parkets.

2448
02:49:40,118 --> 02:49:40,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

2449
02:49:40,418 --> 02:49:40,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Haha.

2450
02:49:41,238 --> 02:49:45,560
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, third... Des Rho has his own albums, and Des Rho hasn't gotten anything yet.

2451
02:49:46,092 --> 02:49:46,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, haha.

2452
02:49:47,173 --> 02:49:48,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, question number three.

2453
02:49:48,353 --> 02:49:53,097
[SPEAKER_02]: In Poppin' Music 7, the song Platonic Love is done by Nard, who is better known by which alias?

2454
02:49:53,237 --> 02:49:53,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2455
02:49:54,297 --> 02:49:54,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh!

2456
02:49:55,802 --> 02:49:58,244
[SPEAKER_02]: slash DJ Nagrius slash Tiger Yamada.

2457
02:49:58,264 --> 02:49:58,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Duh!

2458
02:49:58,904 --> 02:50:00,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, either one of those would have been accepted.

2459
02:50:00,445 --> 02:50:01,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, fourth question.

2460
02:50:01,666 --> 02:50:05,848
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the names of the two star characters in poppin' music, Niami and Nimi?

2461
02:50:07,149 --> 02:50:09,230
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

2462
02:50:09,310 --> 02:50:10,531
[SPEAKER_15]: I was thinking of the other ones.

2463
02:50:10,551 --> 02:50:14,994
[SPEAKER_15]: I was trying to think of that chick from Dimanche that looks like a hussy in the second one.

2464
02:50:15,854 --> 02:50:16,815
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I know.

2465
02:50:16,895 --> 02:50:18,556
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I had the image of them.

2466
02:50:18,636 --> 02:50:20,337
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, that's what they're talking about, and I had no idea.

2467
02:50:20,777 --> 02:50:21,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and the fifth question.

2468
02:50:21,898 --> 02:50:24,620
[SPEAKER_02]: The vocalist from the Swedish song did which song in 8th style?

2469
02:50:25,320 --> 02:50:26,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Murmur Twins.

2470
02:50:26,981 --> 02:50:30,204
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I should have known because it's like Garrett's favorite eight styles.

2471
02:50:30,264 --> 02:50:30,784
[SPEAKER_15]: Or one of them.

2472
02:50:31,204 --> 02:50:31,925
[SPEAKER_15]: One of them, isn't it?

2473
02:50:34,221 --> 02:50:37,502
[SPEAKER_02]: I love number twins.

2474
02:50:37,682 --> 02:50:38,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2475
02:50:38,983 --> 02:50:41,524
[SPEAKER_02]: And that concludes another episode of Orange Crush.

2476
02:50:41,644 --> 02:50:42,444
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

2477
02:50:42,484 --> 02:50:43,084
[SPEAKER_15]: That was beautiful.

2478
02:50:43,104 --> 02:50:43,524
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

2479
02:50:43,724 --> 02:50:44,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Here you go.

2480
02:50:44,405 --> 02:50:44,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Good job.

2481
02:50:44,845 --> 02:50:46,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope the chat room enjoyed that.

2482
02:50:46,725 --> 02:50:47,946
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie and I making butts.

2483
02:50:48,106 --> 02:50:51,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie and I making butts out of ourselves with our lack of pop and music knowledge.

2484
02:50:51,927 --> 02:50:53,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he made the questions.

2485
02:50:53,788 --> 02:50:54,428
[SPEAKER_05]: I got yummy.

2486
02:50:54,828 --> 02:50:56,749
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to give mad props to Garrett.

2487
02:50:57,829 --> 02:50:58,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, he's on compliments.

2488
02:50:59,370 --> 02:51:01,411
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I got it because she was in YY Racing.

2489
02:51:01,451 --> 02:51:03,372
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am so down with Garrett.

2490
02:51:03,632 --> 02:51:09,295
[SPEAKER_15]: The only reason I knew like any of those, or would have known it, you know, I'm such good friends with Garrett, and I still didn't know.

2491
02:51:14,198 --> 02:51:16,719
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so, can I get my chair back?

2492
02:51:17,560 --> 02:51:18,020
[SPEAKER_12]: Please?

2493
02:51:18,953 --> 02:51:19,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Please.

2494
02:51:20,613 --> 02:51:20,874
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright.

2495
02:51:22,274 --> 02:51:23,494
[SPEAKER_12]: What else do you guys want to talk about?

2496
02:51:23,834 --> 02:51:25,775
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you want to say something about poppin' music?

2497
02:51:25,795 --> 02:51:27,455
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we never talk about poppin' music in the show.

2498
02:51:27,475 --> 02:51:28,436
[SPEAKER_12]: You want to say something about it?

2499
02:51:30,156 --> 02:51:30,736
[SPEAKER_12]: Want to say it, Navi?

2500
02:51:32,197 --> 02:51:34,097
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, I'll say something about poppin' music.

2501
02:51:34,457 --> 02:51:40,419
[SPEAKER_14]: Since apparently no one ever really plays it, except for like me and then people in SoCal, as demonstrated by that last quiz.

2502
02:51:40,973 --> 02:51:49,957
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, um, uh, news, uh, Poppin' Music 8 is coming out on July 3rd, um, at home, along with Silent Hill 3 is being released on the same date.

2503
02:51:51,257 --> 02:51:57,840
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, uh, the wonderful little site, Nifty slash Globalgate, where you can translate all those fun Japanese pages into English.

2504
02:51:58,430 --> 02:52:01,714
[SPEAKER_14]: clearly demonstrated how confusing their sites are.

2505
02:52:01,834 --> 02:52:05,918
[SPEAKER_14]: It's either that or the Japanese are weird with the way that they, I don't know.

2506
02:52:06,479 --> 02:52:18,952
[SPEAKER_14]: In my Japanese class, I learn all kinds of stuff about their culture and how, you know, like an example, you don't say you don't want something, you just say, oh, I'll take a little of it, and that means you don't want it, because it's too rude to say you don't want it.

2507
02:52:19,912 --> 02:52:29,658
[SPEAKER_14]: Same kind of goes for when I was trying to translate these pages and read about the pre-orders for the limited edition Poppin' Music stuff, see what the hell they're all putting in it.

2508
02:52:30,418 --> 02:52:40,644
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks like, from the way everything is worded and separated, they have the limited edition package, and then they have the privileged limited edition package.

2509
02:52:41,576 --> 02:52:46,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Which I don't really get what the hell is going on, but needless to say, they're loading this shit up.

2510
02:52:46,800 --> 02:52:48,982
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know why they don't do this for any other Bimani games.

2511
02:52:49,563 --> 02:52:52,985
[SPEAKER_14]: But Poppin' Music 7 had tons and tons of stuff in it.

2512
02:52:53,045 --> 02:52:54,527
[SPEAKER_14]: This one has just as much.

2513
02:52:55,047 --> 02:53:03,654
[SPEAKER_14]: They're putting in long... Besides the VRare CD, we have a new sticker pack with all kinds of stickers of characters and stuff.

2514
02:53:04,155 --> 02:53:04,655
[SPEAKER_14]: There's...

2515
02:53:05,996 --> 02:53:06,737
[SPEAKER_14]: Poppin' Music 8 Poppin' Music 8

2516
02:53:36,396 --> 02:53:42,558
[SPEAKER_14]: God, there was some more stuff too, I can't remember at all, but it's one big humongous package of goodies.

2517
02:53:43,499 --> 02:53:46,880
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's going to be well over a hundred songs in Poppin' Music 8.

2518
02:53:47,700 --> 02:53:57,344
[SPEAKER_14]: There were 54 new songs to begin with in 8, and usually with how they do the consumer stuff, there'll be another 10 to 15 consumer tracks that they add on to this.

2519
02:53:58,024 --> 02:54:01,245
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's going to be quite a nice game.

2520
02:54:02,845 --> 02:54:04,026
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I don't know what else to say.

2521
02:54:05,262 --> 02:54:06,302
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm moist of anticipation.

2522
02:54:06,462 --> 02:54:07,263
[SPEAKER_02]: That was so funny.

2523
02:54:07,403 --> 02:54:10,024
[SPEAKER_02]: One big humongous package of goodies.

2524
02:54:10,804 --> 02:54:14,305
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, pop music tends to be in test located right now in Japan also.

2525
02:54:14,665 --> 02:54:16,626
[SPEAKER_03]: I came up with a stupid thing that you could use.

2526
02:54:17,146 --> 02:54:17,366
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

2527
02:54:18,707 --> 02:54:21,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Now introducing Orange Lounge with a fresher scent.

2528
02:54:22,228 --> 02:54:22,608
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2529
02:54:22,628 --> 02:54:23,349
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very clever.

2530
02:54:23,649 --> 02:54:24,089
[SPEAKER_15]: Very cute.

2531
02:54:25,091 --> 02:54:25,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Not feeling so fresh?

2532
02:54:26,432 --> 02:54:27,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Try the new Orange Lounge.

2533
02:54:27,372 --> 02:54:28,493
[SPEAKER_15]: Douche with Orange Lounge.

2534
02:54:28,773 --> 02:54:29,013
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

2535
02:54:31,334 --> 02:54:32,475
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, my.

2536
02:54:32,495 --> 02:54:33,996
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much for the pop music update.

2537
02:54:34,016 --> 02:54:34,596
[SPEAKER_15]: We appreciate that.

2538
02:54:35,036 --> 02:54:37,998
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll have to bring you back to do it again because none of us keep tabs on pop music.

2539
02:54:38,018 --> 02:54:40,699
[SPEAKER_15]: You're the only person in the whole North State, I think, that plays it regularly.

2540
02:54:41,019 --> 02:54:46,963
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah, and then I'll really get to play it once I get my arcade-style controller so I can tell you how wonderful that is and then you guys can be jealous.

2541
02:54:48,503 --> 02:54:49,244
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll get to play it.

2542
02:54:49,264 --> 02:54:49,924
[SPEAKER_15]: You better let me play it.

2543
02:54:49,944 --> 02:54:53,606
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to bring it to an episode and then we'll just have an episode of Orange Lounge where I hear in the background, Pop!

2544
02:54:56,536 --> 02:55:01,977
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I also want to give the mic to Loki real fast because it's been two weeks with no sim update so he might have something to say.

2545
02:55:04,347 --> 02:55:07,429
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, there's still Tourney Mix 4, which I gotta work on my entry for that.

2546
02:55:08,030 --> 02:55:11,552
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um, there's, you know, check my sims, tons of stuff there.

2547
02:55:11,592 --> 02:55:12,573
[SPEAKER_15]: My site's still gone.

2548
02:55:13,533 --> 02:55:17,236
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um, um, let me see.

2549
02:55:18,697 --> 02:55:22,379
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, oh, new DWI version, there's a 2.49, I think.

2550
02:55:22,939 --> 02:55:26,982
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's got, like, a bunch of bug fixes and stuff, so we're good to go and download that.

2551
02:55:27,062 --> 02:55:27,642
[SPEAKER_15]: It's pretty cool.

2552
02:55:28,563 --> 02:55:32,966
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um, other than that, I don't think there's really anything going on.

2553
02:55:35,057 --> 02:55:35,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

2554
02:55:36,077 --> 02:55:36,337
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

2555
02:55:37,078 --> 02:55:37,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2556
02:55:38,558 --> 02:55:45,120
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, since we have such a long-ass fortune cookie message today, thanks to Jamie, I'm going to go around and collect everyone's final thought.

2557
02:55:45,160 --> 02:55:45,660
[SPEAKER_15]: It's that time.

2558
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:46,920
[SPEAKER_15]: It's that time of the show, you guys.

2559
02:55:46,940 --> 02:55:47,500
[SPEAKER_15]: End of show.

2560
02:55:47,580 --> 02:55:49,241
[SPEAKER_15]: So I guess since Irene's got the mic, we'll start with her.

2561
02:55:49,741 --> 02:55:49,821
[SPEAKER_15]: No?

2562
02:55:49,841 --> 02:55:50,641
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to start with Garrett?

2563
02:55:51,441 --> 02:55:52,362
[SPEAKER_15]: Garrett doesn't have a final thought.

2564
02:55:53,382 --> 02:55:53,902
[SPEAKER_15]: No final thought.

2565
02:55:54,422 --> 02:55:55,262
[SPEAKER_15]: Nellie have a final thought?

2566
02:55:58,003 --> 02:55:59,744
[SPEAKER_15]: The show fucking sucks, says Nellie.

2567
02:55:59,784 --> 02:56:00,244
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2568
02:56:00,344 --> 02:56:00,704
[SPEAKER_15]: We agree.

2569
02:56:02,124 --> 02:56:02,504
[SPEAKER_15]: Irene.

2570
02:56:03,325 --> 02:56:03,985
[SPEAKER_15]: Brad, final thought.

2571
02:56:07,262 --> 02:56:09,783
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to RagnarConline.com and download the game.

2572
02:56:11,044 --> 02:56:11,404
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

2573
02:56:12,184 --> 02:56:12,665
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all.

2574
02:56:12,985 --> 02:56:13,705
[SPEAKER_00]: Play on Loki.

2575
02:56:13,785 --> 02:56:14,386
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I am.

2576
02:56:14,546 --> 02:56:15,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Play on Chaos.

2577
02:56:15,506 --> 02:56:16,126
[SPEAKER_00]: Play on Loki.

2578
02:56:16,727 --> 02:56:18,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Play on Chaos Loki.

2579
02:56:19,208 --> 02:56:19,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2580
02:56:20,088 --> 02:56:21,329
[SPEAKER_00]: How about we all just get a life?

2581
02:56:22,089 --> 02:56:24,150
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think Loki would appreciate you all playing on him.

2582
02:56:25,471 --> 02:56:26,872
[SPEAKER_15]: Final thought, Irene.

2583
02:56:27,812 --> 02:56:28,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Garrett's great.

2584
02:56:28,793 --> 02:56:31,054
[SPEAKER_02]: He did my hair and it looks so awesome.

2585
02:56:31,754 --> 02:56:32,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2586
02:56:32,415 --> 02:56:33,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, bye.

2587
02:56:33,415 --> 02:56:34,616
[SPEAKER_12]: Final thought, Pixie Dust.

2588
02:56:35,859 --> 02:56:37,479
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to meet a cute boy.

2589
02:56:38,340 --> 02:56:38,940
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm right here.

2590
02:56:39,160 --> 02:56:42,461
[SPEAKER_03]: I said a cute boy, not a Buddha boy.

2591
02:56:42,481 --> 02:56:44,901
[SPEAKER_13]: I am so offended.

2592
02:56:45,221 --> 02:56:46,021
[SPEAKER_13]: Get out of my house.

2593
02:56:47,282 --> 02:56:50,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Nigga, please.

2594
02:56:51,503 --> 02:56:52,723
[SPEAKER_15]: She is part black.

2595
02:56:52,743 --> 02:56:53,563
[SPEAKER_15]: She can say that word.

2596
02:56:56,124 --> 02:56:57,604
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why I can say fag, because I'm gay.

2597
02:56:57,944 --> 02:57:00,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, Angel.

2598
02:57:00,925 --> 02:57:01,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Angel, final thought.

2599
02:57:02,245 --> 02:57:05,306
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just glad I got to spend the weekend with my best friends ever.

2600
02:57:07,205 --> 02:57:07,365
[SPEAKER_15]: Aw.

2601
02:57:07,686 --> 02:57:09,066
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody, aw, DDR Angel.

2602
02:57:11,087 --> 02:57:11,327
Aw.

2603
02:57:12,048 --> 02:57:13,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm loved now.

2604
02:57:14,268 --> 02:57:15,109
[SPEAKER_15]: Magus, final thought.

2605
02:57:16,890 --> 02:57:19,471
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, ha ha, I'm still better than the Clippers, bitch.

2606
02:57:23,372 --> 02:57:23,813
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway.

2607
02:57:26,134 --> 02:57:28,275
[SPEAKER_12]: Marin, final thought.

2608
02:57:30,836 --> 02:57:31,716
[SPEAKER_12]: Aw, she doesn't have a final thought.

2609
02:57:31,736 --> 02:57:32,636
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for coming, Marin.

2610
02:57:32,677 --> 02:57:33,377
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody give Marin a hand.

2611
02:57:33,457 --> 02:57:33,777
[SPEAKER_12]: Yay.

2612
02:57:36,435 --> 02:57:37,855
[SPEAKER_15]: So many new faces on tonight's show.

2613
02:57:37,895 --> 02:57:38,236
[SPEAKER_15]: It's nice.

2614
02:57:38,656 --> 02:57:40,036
[SPEAKER_15]: They can't see any of them.

2615
02:57:40,056 --> 02:57:42,237
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, you can't see any of them because we were too lazy to set the webcam.

2616
02:57:43,017 --> 02:57:44,458
[SPEAKER_15]: You want me to go to Loki for final thought here?

2617
02:57:44,798 --> 02:57:45,038
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

2618
02:57:45,839 --> 02:57:47,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Richie, I love you.

2619
02:57:48,900 --> 02:57:49,680
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, final thought.

2620
02:57:51,901 --> 02:57:53,262
[SPEAKER_15]: I hate you, PayPal.

2621
02:57:55,863 --> 02:57:56,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just make this clear.

2622
02:57:57,343 --> 02:57:58,624
[SPEAKER_03]: A cute single boy.

2623
02:57:59,639 --> 02:58:04,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, single, straight, not gay, because I have a lot of gay male friends.

2624
02:58:06,947 --> 02:58:12,113
[SPEAKER_03]: No, as in, not, I don't know, just not seeing anybody.

2625
02:58:15,201 --> 02:58:16,742
[SPEAKER_03]: I want the age range of 21 to 27.

2626
02:58:17,222 --> 02:58:17,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2627
02:58:20,364 --> 02:58:20,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

2628
02:58:21,224 --> 02:58:21,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

2629
02:58:23,466 --> 02:58:24,866
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll let Jamie have the final, final thought.

2630
02:58:24,906 --> 02:58:32,830
[SPEAKER_15]: My final thought is me and EvilNaoki2DX, our Japanese schoolgirl love, love, sugar routine is going to be the best thing ever.

2631
02:58:35,832 --> 02:58:36,352
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie, your turn.

2632
02:58:37,233 --> 02:58:37,793
[SPEAKER_05]: My turn?

2633
02:58:37,813 --> 02:58:38,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2634
02:58:39,614 --> 02:58:39,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2635
02:58:42,702 --> 02:58:43,062
[SPEAKER_05]: I turned.

2636
02:58:44,142 --> 02:58:45,383
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but none of them saw that.

2637
02:58:45,403 --> 02:58:46,023
[SPEAKER_05]: That was bad radio.

2638
02:58:46,963 --> 02:58:49,964
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is... I just thought it.

2639
02:58:50,104 --> 02:58:50,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.

2640
02:58:51,805 --> 02:58:52,065
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

2641
02:58:52,265 --> 02:58:53,185
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought my thoughts.

2642
02:58:53,645 --> 02:58:56,366
[SPEAKER_05]: And tonight... I'm tired.

2643
02:58:57,346 --> 02:59:04,309
[SPEAKER_15]: The last word of tonight's show goes to... You've had it before.

2644
02:59:04,909 --> 02:59:06,609
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to... Maren, because she didn't say it in front of us.

2645
02:59:06,649 --> 02:59:07,109
[SPEAKER_15]: Last word.

2646
02:59:07,910 --> 02:59:08,770
[SPEAKER_16]: Burnin' Nation.

2647
02:59:10,646 --> 02:59:13,007

2650
02:59:20,090 --> 02:59:22,891
[SPEAKER_13]: And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2652
02:59:33,495 --> 02:59:35,215

2653
02:59:35,255 --> 02:59:36,276
[SPEAKER_08]: We're honored by your presence.

[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the man don't think so, and he be cruising down here to check out this ride.

2659
03:00:03,578 --> 03:00:05,740
[SPEAKER_08]: He gonna put a cap in your white ass.

2660
03:00:06,380 --> 03:00:07,201
[SPEAKER_08]: We should double our efforts.

2661
03:00:08,062 --> 03:00:08,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn straight.

2662
03:00:09,383 --> 03:00:11,744

[SPEAKER_15]: and Fade to Black.

[SPEAKER_15]: The afterbirth of Orange Lounge Radio.

2667
03:01:23,010 --> 03:01:26,432
[SPEAKER_15]: Not the stillbirth, the afterbirth of Orange Lounge Radio.

2668
03:01:26,492 --> 03:01:29,614
[SPEAKER_15]: Anybody have anything extra they wanted to add that they didn't get out during the three hours?

2669
03:01:30,095 --> 03:01:31,576
[SPEAKER_15]: Something that they don't want in the archives?

2670
03:01:32,156 --> 03:01:32,376
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

2671
03:01:32,436 --> 03:01:33,497
[SPEAKER_15]: You're really white, you know that?

2672
03:01:33,557 --> 03:01:35,018
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to play that song at the very end.

2673
03:01:49,060 --> 03:01:51,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know Brad was married.

2674
03:01:51,724 --> 03:01:52,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Does he have a wife?

2675
03:01:55,209 --> 03:01:56,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they in Utah?

2676
03:01:57,413 --> 03:01:57,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Well...

2677
03:02:07,437 --> 03:02:15,983
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd just like to add an extra plug for our Bomani Music and More program, which is always on when we're not here, because we love people that listen to Orange Lounge Radio all the time.

2678
03:02:16,364 --> 03:02:18,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to add an extra plug to your ass, Ron.

2679
03:02:19,446 --> 03:02:22,268
[SPEAKER_15]: How do you know it's not already plugged?

2680
03:02:22,448 --> 03:02:23,729
[SPEAKER_03]: There's too many plugs in there.

2681
03:02:23,749 --> 03:02:24,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Add an extra plug.

2682
03:02:24,992 --> 03:02:26,512
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, an extra plug, I'm sorry.

2683
03:02:27,213 --> 03:02:30,673
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, you remember that sex scene in the Matrix with all the plugs?

2684
03:02:31,373 --> 03:02:33,774
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you see the sex scene in the Matrix Reloaded?

2685
03:02:33,794 --> 03:02:33,974
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

2686
03:02:34,034 --> 03:02:35,574
[SPEAKER_15]: How they had all the plugs in them?

2687
03:02:35,895 --> 03:02:37,575
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, I wonder if they got one in their butt.

2688
03:02:40,236 --> 03:02:45,517
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this has been an enlightening experience, and I know this, that I'm surrounded by dirty mofos.

2689
03:02:46,677 --> 03:02:47,397
[SPEAKER_15]: You fit right in.

2690
03:02:48,477 --> 03:02:50,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a dirty mofo too, so I fit just right in.

2691
03:02:54,622 --> 03:02:54,982
[SPEAKER_15]: Beautiful.

2692
03:02:58,784 --> 03:02:59,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Rob.

2693
03:02:59,504 --> 03:02:59,764
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes?

2694
03:03:00,265 --> 03:03:02,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have a phone sex operator voice?

2695
03:03:02,406 --> 03:03:03,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Kinda, why?

2696
03:03:03,166 --> 03:03:05,827
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of guys tell me that for some odd reason when I'm on the phone.

2697
03:03:05,847 --> 03:03:08,488
[SPEAKER_15]: Why don't you give us your best phone sex operator voice right now.

2698
03:03:11,790 --> 03:03:14,531
[SPEAKER_15]: Here, let's pretend I'm calling a 900 line, okay?

2699
03:03:14,551 --> 03:03:15,231
[SPEAKER_15]: Here we go.

2700
03:03:15,271 --> 03:03:18,953
[SPEAKER_15]: This is me and Pixie S. This is me calling a straight 900 number line, okay?

2701
03:03:18,973 --> 03:03:19,133
[SPEAKER_15]: Ready?

2702
03:03:20,013 --> 03:03:20,814
[SPEAKER_12]: Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.

2703
03:03:21,254 --> 03:03:21,794
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello.

2704
03:03:21,814 --> 03:03:23,075
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi?

2705
03:03:23,115 --> 03:03:23,355
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi?

2706
03:03:24,656 --> 03:03:25,797
[SPEAKER_12]: What's your name, little boy?

2707
03:03:26,597 --> 03:03:27,898
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Brad.

2708
03:03:33,801 --> 03:03:34,702
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, hello, Brad.

2709
03:03:34,742 --> 03:03:35,742
[SPEAKER_12]: What are you wearing right now?

2710
03:03:37,123 --> 03:03:40,425
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm wearing a red shirt and khakis.

2711
03:03:41,406 --> 03:03:42,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are you wearing so much clothing?

2712
03:03:42,887 --> 03:03:43,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Take it off.

2713
03:03:43,707 --> 03:03:46,509
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

2714
03:03:46,529 --> 03:03:47,609
[SPEAKER_12]: Why should I take it off?

2715
03:03:48,110 --> 03:03:49,951
[SPEAKER_12]: Because you're a naughty, naughty boy.

2716
03:03:50,431 --> 03:03:52,072
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know you want some Miracle Whip.

2717
03:03:55,785 --> 03:03:57,605
[SPEAKER_12]: What are you going to do to me, Miss Phone Lady?

2718
03:03:59,346 --> 03:04:02,087
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Dambi, and I want to ravage your cunt.

2719
03:04:03,987 --> 03:04:04,967
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have a cunt.

2720
03:04:06,008 --> 03:04:07,208
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, pretend you do.

2721
03:04:11,869 --> 03:04:13,930
[SPEAKER_03]: You all can ravage your cunts all later.

2722
03:04:20,531 --> 03:04:21,491
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't take it anymore.

2723
03:04:22,112 --> 03:04:22,412
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

2724
03:04:24,099 --> 03:04:27,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that was good enough for you, baby, as good it was for me.

2725
03:04:27,442 --> 03:04:27,882
[SPEAKER_15]: I came.

2726
03:04:28,022 --> 03:04:28,762
[SPEAKER_15]: That was so great.

2727
03:04:28,943 --> 03:04:29,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thank you.

2728
03:04:35,247 --> 03:04:43,553
[SPEAKER_05]: I imagine these phone sex operators are probably sitting back there, you know, knitting or doing their laundry or playing with their Game Boy while they're...

2729
03:04:44,944 --> 03:04:45,965
[SPEAKER_05]: I came to the final boss.

2730
03:05:08,228 --> 03:05:08,848
[SPEAKER_15]: That was beautiful.

2731
03:05:10,209 --> 03:05:13,091
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm still queuing up the post-show music, so does anybody else want to add something?

2732
03:05:13,232 --> 03:05:15,073
[SPEAKER_03]: There's something for, like, somebody coming.

2733
03:05:15,493 --> 03:05:15,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes!

2734
03:05:16,074 --> 03:05:16,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes!

2735
03:05:16,574 --> 03:05:16,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes!

2736
03:05:17,174 --> 03:05:18,195
[SPEAKER_03]: I beat Legend of Max!

2737
03:05:18,535 --> 03:05:18,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah!

2738
03:05:19,536 --> 03:05:20,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah!

2739
03:05:21,057 --> 03:05:22,158
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's the DDR machine.

2740
03:05:22,378 --> 03:05:22,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God!

2741
03:05:23,299 --> 03:05:23,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God!

2742
03:05:23,919 --> 03:05:24,439
[SPEAKER_05]: It does that.

2743
03:05:25,300 --> 03:05:28,522
[SPEAKER_05]: On the third mixes, if you triple-A it, it'll go, oh, God!

2744
03:05:28,863 --> 03:05:29,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God!

2745
03:05:29,323 --> 03:05:29,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that.

2746
03:05:33,286 --> 03:05:34,086
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys are horrible.

2747
03:05:34,707 --> 03:05:35,127
[SPEAKER_12]: Bag it.

2748
03:05:35,839 --> 03:05:37,120
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, we're going to go now.

2749
03:05:37,901 --> 03:05:38,682
[SPEAKER_15]: Good night, everybody.

2750
03:05:40,003 --> 03:05:46,429
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki would like to play a quick remix for you that he really likes, and then we're going to have a mini 2DX marathon, so you guys should enjoy that, shouldn't you?

2751
03:05:47,750 --> 03:05:49,872
[SPEAKER_15]: And that'll be it.

2752
03:05:50,773 --> 03:05:52,314
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Loki, introduce this mix.

2753
03:05:53,235 --> 03:05:54,517
[SPEAKER_15]: This is Max Wishful.

2754
03:05:54,577 --> 03:05:56,839
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a remix of Max 300 and...
