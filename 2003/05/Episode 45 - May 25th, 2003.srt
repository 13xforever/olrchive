1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio Season 3, now with 200% more hot monkey sex.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain 200% more hot monkey sex.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It will contain 300% more hot monkey sex.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hey guys, cut the track!

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Okay, I guess it's back to the real intro.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yeah, me and him have fun, too!

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Toto?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio for Monty Talk and Then Some.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yes, I will spank your child.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Well, here's my big opening.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
A sphincter says what?

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm super. Thanks for asking.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What am I doing here?

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
No.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Dodge this.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Mm-hmm. This is a tasty burger.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Look, you stupid bastard. You've got no arms left.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yes, I have. Look.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Just a flesh wound.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Searching for a boy in high school isn't useless.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's searching for meaning in a polyshore.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oh, yeah? Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Dark Sakura.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
but I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Loki.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I hate you!

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,240
Orange Lounge Radio is now live for this episode 45 here on May 25th of 2003.

36
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:12,780
You're tuned into the Bemani Scene's most starzy radio station of all scenes of Bemani.

37
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,380
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

38
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,340
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,220
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Sommers.

40
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,740
You know her better as Dark Sakura?

41
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,340
Who just copped up a lung?

42
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,820
You might want to go buy some masks at Walgreens or something.

43
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,740
No, I was going to buy some in San Francisco.

44
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,420
We found SARS masks in the Japan Center Mall.

45
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,580
That's cool.

46
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,260
I almost bought some, but I bought them on my bed.

47
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,140

she's shy

69
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,900
So I guess we'll get started with the show.

70
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,300
There's also four people that are out in the pool right now who aren't even in here right now, so

Yay! Which means, on the show tonight, somebody will get married, have a baby, or die.

00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,620

00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,060
Tonight, we jump the shark.

75
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,420

76
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:28,340

uh brad's still outside but hi everyone

143
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,720
how was the pool

144
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
So, there's too many people there.

145
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,720
Oh.

146
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,400
I'm afraid of pools and apartment complexes.

147
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,960
Why are you afraid of pools?

148
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
Yeah.

149
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,520
Jamie, why are you afraid of pools?

150
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,220
Because little children pee and go poo.

151
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:58,560
I was in a public pool once and I saw a big turd floating in the pool.

152
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,720
That reminds me of Caddyshack where the baby roosters fall from the pool.

153
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,720
I actually saw it happen.

154
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,720
Let's talk about things that have happened while we were last on the air, which was two weeks ago.

155
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
I got SARS.

156
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,720
Okay, go in the shower.

157
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,720
We're trying to do a show here, hello.

158
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,720
Jamie, how was your two weeks?

159
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,720
Um, it was okay.

160
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,720
We sort of did a show last weekend, sort of.

161
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,720
Yeah, we broadcasted all day long from B3.

162
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,720
What did you guys think of B3? What did you think of B3, the big tournament that happened at Pier 39?

163
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,720
I sort of missed all of Sunday because I decided to go to the mall.

164
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:40,280
I don't know, do you think B3, because a lot of people online were kind of like, kind of

165
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,240
had this kind of, like, you know how B3 was supposed to be like this huge tournament,

166
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,600
you know, it was going to be like the biggest tournament ever, and a lot of people just

167
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,440
came back from it feeling kind of mediocre.

168
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,160
They were like, uh, PA kind of down the hill thing.

169
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,160
I think it was timing because there was a lot going on around there.

170
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,160
I agree.

171
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,160
I think it was just bad timing.

172
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,160
I think the original plan for B3 is that they were supposed to do it over spring break,

173
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,000
and I think that would have been cool, but the time they did it just kind of turned out

174
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,280
I don't know. Yeah, it's too bad because they ended up doing it the same weekend as e3

175
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,280
Which caused a lot of confusion in the names alone

176
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:17,520
I think it's weird though because everything at the tournament was put together really well and everything was run really well

177
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:24,360
I mean sure ran a little late, but all tournaments do but yet despite how everything how great everything ran

178
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:31,880
It's just kind of everybody was just kind of bleh and freestyle with the exception of two routines was kind of bleh.

179
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:40,400
I don't know. That's my little rant on b3. I mean it's certainly nobody's fault. It's just kind of like I think everybody just kind of

180
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,440
Must have had what I think everybody was on their collective period or something. I think that's what it is

181
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,640
Jamie you're staring off into space

182
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:56,300
You have anything you want to say about B3, Logie?

183
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:02,160
I didn't get a badge and I didn't get a chair until after I asked.

184
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:14,620
And I didn't get my free shirt done, as promised.

185
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,120
I liked being able to broadcast though because like we were like five feet away from the machine and that was cool

186
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,600
Because we were like broadcasting everybody there were stop stop stop stop stop. Yeah, stop stop stop stop

187
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,200
There were a lot of you guys listening to the stomp

188
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,980
I think a lot of you tuned in and just kind of had it as background noise noise for the day

189
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,500
which is cool, you know, whatever whatever floats your boat and

190
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,340
I

191
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:40,900
Think it gives me anyway battleship. Yeah, it gives me incentive anyway to

192
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:46,620
to uh... broadcast for more terms in the future

193
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,540
well

194
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,940
can you guys shut the door

195
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,380
season

196
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,540
and i mean speaking in and get it

197
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,580
i have three people in my shower right now

198
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,080
this is all the season premiere stuff going on we had nudity new characters

199
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,980
and now they're all in my shower at the same time

200
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,980
I saw Garret's ass. He's showing me a scar by his ass. How funny.

201
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:14,980
I'm not taking a shower. I'm right here.

202
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,980
She says she's right here, staying in the studio, not taking a shower.

203
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,980
But she's in the shower. I don't believe her.

204
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,980
Segue, segue. While we were sort of on the subject of B3, Loki, I believe you owe me something.

205
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:36,980
Perhaps, I don't know, an apology. As promised. You are on the spot!

206
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,980
Loki's eyes got really big like a deer in headlights. He doesn't even remember.

207
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,980
What the hell are you talking about?

208
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:53,980
What? What the hell are you talking about? Seriously?

209
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,980
Of what?

210
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,140
you need to remind loki what he said to make that actually keep up with what

211
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:04,420
does on these episodes

212
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,480
i believe there is this really

213
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,780
uh... bad

214
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,220
wait what was the second day freestyle or

215
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,780
first it was p a m freestyle

216
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,660
yeah i think it was a really bad freestyle and you're like

217
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,740
oh my god if these people that were here

218
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:22,200
or at uh... shaft and brewing maggots off that they would

219
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,200
screw the other guy up instead and cheer Magus on. I was confused. Anyway, whatever.

220
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,200
Yeah, because that guy really sucked.

221
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,200
I mean, he was like, oh my god, spazzing up on the pad.

222
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,200
And this is relief for me, who went out to go get Oyakodar.

223
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,200
But no, no apologies, sorry.

224
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,200
Ah, he died.

225
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,200
As Magus shows Loki his IQ of one.

226
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Very, very nice.

227
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,200
I hear you turning dials.

228
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,200
This camera is the suck.

229
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
No wonder these are bi-link hit-win-free, they're ass.

230
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,200
So why are we having all this dead airspace, Rob?

231
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,200
I have no idea, because I'm too distracted by the people in my shower right now.

232
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,200
Because I keep hearing nudity and oh my god and ass and tattoos and scarves.

233
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,200
Did you just like put them all out in the yard and get the water hose?

234
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,200
water hose.

235
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:23,280
First, Irene walks in the door when Garrett's changing, she doesn't bother knocking.

236
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,760
This time, she knows that he's in the shower, but he opens up the shark urn, she opens the

237
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,120
shark urn anyway, and he's naked.

238
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,600
No, I just realized that he was all changing and getting naked, he had a towel around him,

239
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
okay?

240
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,520
Well, great, we got our nudity out of the way in the first ten minutes of the show,

241
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,520
beautiful.

242
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,200
But we haven't even talked about porn yet.

243
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,500
I know and there's been no porn discussion yet

244
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,280
uh... also

245
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,200
what movie?

246
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,980
Oh, tell us about the movie we watched last night, Angel. I'll let you tell the story.

247
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,660
Oh, was that last night when she was here?

248
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,820
Or Thursday night?

249
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,340
Yeah, I caught it!

250
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,620
Yeah, tell us about the movie we watched Thursday night.

251
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,880
It sucked ass.

252
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,220
It was kinda boring and

253
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,840
I don't even know why the hell you got me to watch it.

254
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,820
Never rent

255
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:17,820
whatever the hell that movie was

256
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,100
the film that we watched was called

257
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,680
Envy, actually it says Envy on the box, it's actual full title is called Penis Envy

258
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,780
it's a story about these two drifting chicks, they're walking through the desert

259
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:33,080
they go to this bar and they get really drunk and I mean this is talking about

260
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,080
like white trash America

261
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,680
they get drunk and they're walking through the desert and all of a sudden they go

262
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,600
Wouldn't it be great to have a penis?

263
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,680
And so they walk around, and lo and behold,

264
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,100
when this one chick's taking a piss,

265
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,640
they find the penis fairy, which is this giant drag queen guy.

266
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,580
And then they go and ask the penis fairy for a penis,

267
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,040
and they get a penis.

268
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,160
But with the penis comes great responsibility.

269
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,120
And they have mustaches, and body hair, and tattoos,

270
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,600
and they start acting like guys.

271
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,600
Hey, Loki?

272
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,960
Was it Mr. Spanky?

273
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,780
And then they start like, you know, screwing this one chick and then this other thing,

274
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:15,020
they screw this other guy and then eventually they get tired of having a penis and so they go

275
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,500
and find the penis fairy in LA where she's at a gay bar.

276
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:22,020
And then they ask for the penis fairy to remove the penis and then,

277
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:29,300
but the one chick likes the penis so much and then she ends up getting killed in the end.

278
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,180
That was beautiful, thank you.

279
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:38,180
Anyway, let's try to focus on some Bahmani news, because there was lots of it while we were gone for two weeks.

280
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:43,180
So, Max 2 USA was the big kind of announcement that...

281
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:49,180
Well, there were several games that were announced at E3, the big convention that none of us got to go to, because nobody takes this show seriously.

282
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,180
Hey, I could have gone.

283
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,180
You could have been able to go, but not because of this show.

284
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,180
I couldn't get off work.

285
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,180
Oh, I'm sorry.

286
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:19,180
But there were lots of fun things discussed at E3. First off was Max2USA and we heard a bunch of songs were announced for inclusion, including Days Go By by Dirty Vegas, the song you heard in the last break, Four Strings Take Me Away into the Night, and also Jocelyn and Rika's Little Bit of Ecstasy. All those songs, by the way, are in rotation right now in our stations, so if you want to check them out.

287
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:27,180
But what I find really interesting about Max2USA is that the real music videos are going to be in the backgrounds now.

288
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,180
That's going to be pretty cool.

289
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:39,180
Do you think that there's going to be an option where you can select, oh I want the big seizure, flashy looking graphics, amazing Japanese fun, or you can have the real music video?

290
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:45,180
I don't know, but it doesn't bother me either way.

291
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:50,180
I wonder if they're going to have long versions because of the music videos.

292
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,180
Long versions, that would be interesting.

293
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:56,180
Now, you know they've promised, I guess, different modes that we haven't seen in the U.S. before?

294
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,180
Music video mode.

295
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,180
So, like, music video mode, like, where you could just watch the videos.

296
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:06,180
Kind of like, okay, you're remembering 2DX6 style, how you could just watch the videos if you wanted to?

297
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,180
Do you think they'll have something like that?

298
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,180
That'd be cool.

299
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,180
Yes, that would be neat.

300
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:16,500
Because I know that I've had gatherings where people just put in sick style and watch the

301
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,540
videos and drank.

302
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,700
I could go for some drink.

303
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,220
Do they have the mode where you get to meet Kiryamoka?

304
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:31,020
Because he was at E3 and yeah.

305
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:36,300
Because I don't really give a shit about Max USA or any DDR or whatnot.

306
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,300
I want to be Kiryamoka.

307
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,900
Why don't you give a shit about Max 2 USA, because I'll tell you right now, it's going

308
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,340
to be better than the Japanese Max 2, because I played the Japanese Max 2 for three days

309
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,820
and I haven't played since.

310
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,300
Because this DDR sucks.

311
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,300
I play Beatmania.

312
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,540
When are they going to bring out a new console, Beatmania?

313
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,700
That's all I care about.

314
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,300
That was the other interesting bit of news.

315
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,340
There was this big rumor going around that Konami was going to, I know we talked about

316
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,380
this on the show and we read it with extreme caution.

317
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,020
I think I called it, didn't I?

318
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,020
Oh yeah.

319
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,540
sure we all approach it with this big bit of skepticism.

320
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,640
If I remember right, the news source wasn't a very trustworthy one.

321
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,340
But they were announcing 2DX USA, and they were going to have a machine brought to E3,

322
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:24,440
and they were going to bring in like Take and Yes, or no, not them, Lisu and who's the

323
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,440
other guy?

324
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,440
Agop.

325
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,140
They were going to bring in Lisu and Agop and have them playing at E3 to show Americans

326
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,140
how to play 2DX.

327
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,060
What a bunch of crap.

328
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,080
So that didn't end up happening.

329
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,080
But I don't know.

330
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:43,080
I'm pretty sure we talked about it on the show before, but does the USA really deserve 2DX?

331
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,080
It just happened anyway.

332
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,080
If they brought 2DX to the USA, it wouldn't sell for shit.

333
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,080
Like, how everyone said that...

334
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:58,080
They complained that frequency was too difficult, so they made amplitude easier, and hence it became an even bigger piece of crap.

335
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,080
I like amplitude.

336
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,080
What would you like to repeat that for our listeners?

337
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,080
I like Super Sproat, that song is cool and that's about it.

338
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,080
Wait, so before we move on to other games, nobody has any other thoughts on Max 2 USA?

339
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,080
Is anybody looking forward to it? Nobody cares?

340
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,080
It'll be out, but you know. It'll be fun for about a week.

341
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,080
You know what though, I am going to have the Xbox One. Oh yeah, that's the other one we can talk about.

342
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,080
I have no choice because we get everything cool that comes out on Xbox.

343
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,080
I mean, I got Steel Battalion, of course I'm going to have DDR.

344
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:41,080
DDR, although the dance pad looks retarded, it's green, and it's official though.

345
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,120
I don't know, the dance pads are kind of scary to me, they're all freaky looking.

346
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,120
Like they're red.

347
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,120
They're Xbox-y.

348
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,720
Well, Xbox everything is freaky looking.

349
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,480
But they're actually Konami made pads.

350
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,480
Hmm.

351
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,800
Well, you know the producer of the DDR Xbox game was on DDR Freak earlier this week and

352
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,420
he said a few things about the game, which are interesting.

353
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:05,180
He says that the look of the game that they showed at E3 is not representative of the

354
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,660
final gameplay.

355
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:10,940
So in that version there was no 3D, no music videos, and haven't even begun to show what

356
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,780
the Xbox is capable of.

357
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,780
So I guess that's kind of interesting because I guess in a way they're saying, hey, Max

358
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:21,800
2 USA was further along than DDR Xbox was.

359
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:28,920
Also Freezeros will be in DDR Ultramax except there were none at E3.

360
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,420
You're going to be able to play it online, so you're going to be able to get on Xbox

361
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:36,900
Live and have live rankings and statistics, and your individual scores will be able to

362
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:41,020
be ranked with the rest of the people via a live connection, and you can also have edited

363
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:45,600
step data, and you can upload and download that by users, and new songs will be released

364
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,100
on a monthly basis for download.

365
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,740
However, there's a rumor going around that says you might have to pay for these songs.

366
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,740
Who knows?

367
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,380
Yeah, what is that about?

368
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:57,420
I mean, if it were, like, for the licensed stuff, I could understand, but if it were

369
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:02,140
I mean, that doesn't sound fair.

370
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,860
Especially if they're all songs we've played to death already.

371
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:08,940
I don't think I could rationalize paying like five bucks for a new song or something, you

372
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,340
know?

373
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,180
Would anybody here actually admit to paying for new DDR songs just so they could have

374
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,180
everything?

375
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,180
No.

376
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,180
Okay.

377
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,180
That's a no.

378
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,660
How about the chat room?

379
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,660
I don't know.

380
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,660
I'm not even watching the chat room right now.

381
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,660
Chat room?

382
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,620
Who cares about them?

383
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,860
We do. I love chat room.

384
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,960
You hang out in our chat room?

385
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,660
It sounds like a cheap, interesting way to make money.

386
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,700
But don't you, correct me if I'm wrong, Jamie, you're the one that's played Xbox

387
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,660
online. I don't think anyone else here has.

388
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:44,100
No, I watched Dan play it. But don't you have to... He's a street fighter.

389
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,100
Don't you have to pay per month for that anyway?

390
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,620
Xbox Live? Yeah.

391
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:53,740
So now you're going to have to pay per month and pay per song you want to download? You shouldn't have to.

392
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,880
I know, that's gay.

393
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,280
It's called Licensing Rights, yay!

394
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,840
Pretty soon there's going to be a Napster for DDR.

395
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,780
Actually, why not?

396
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,120
I mean, think about it, you're downloading a program.

397
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,460
I mean, people could share programs online.

398
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,120
I mean, why not?

399
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,600
I'm sure they'll have a site where you can download them illegally.

400
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,260
Anyway, also the producer of Ultramix says that there's going

401
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:29,940
to be 55 songs planned for the US version, 10 of those licensed and if I'm not mistaking

402
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:35,220
only 5 of them in Max USA were licensed so that's going to be interesting.

403
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:39,620
And also kind of a big one, there's no Ultramix PC version.

404
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,220
There was a big rumor that it was going to be out for the PC.

405
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,780
That got shot down.

406
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:49,580
The reason why I pretty much figured it wouldn't happen, there's already DDR PC.

407
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,580
But it sucks.

408
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,580
It really sucks.

409
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:56,440
It does, true, but you know what Pump It Up for PC worked?

410
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,440
Why?

411
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,840
Because Pump It Up was made for a PC anyway.

412
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,240
That's very true.

413
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,980
It runs off the PC software anyways.

414
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,320
All the big Pump It Up machine, that giant machine is, it's just there's little PC in

415
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,360
there that runs everything.

416
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,360
Yep.

417
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:17,740
But, I don't know, I think, but you know, what's weird about DDRPC, look at StepMania.

418
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,280
StepMania does it way better than DDRPC did.

419
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,000
So it's kind of like you can't use the excuse that it's not possible to do on a computer

420
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,800
because StepMania, hey, if they'd released something like that as DDRPC, I bet a lot

421
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,600
of people would have been, you know, would have been, wow, this is great.

422
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,600
Yeah.

423
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,160
But they only have StepMania and then we'll go, oh, I'll just download all these songs

424
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,600
or make my own that I think are better.

425
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:44,680
Yeah, maybe, do you think that maybe that's why they've given up on DDRPC because of StepMania?

426
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,200
I would probably think so.

427
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,040
You know, how can you compete with something that's free?

428
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,400
Why do you think Konami hasn't sued the people who made StepMania?

429
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,480
Anybody want to venture a guess?

430
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:04,280
I would think, well, first of all, the programming itself, if they did not reverse engineer it,

431
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:08,940
if they actually made it right from scratch with their own source, they can't sue them

432
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:09,940
for using...

433
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:13,360
That's the whole problem with BLEAM, why they couldn't do BLEAM.

434
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,680
Because they made their program for BLEAM from scratch.

435
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,680
they sue for the whole look and feel thing though? I'm thinking back to, you remember

436
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:25,140
when Street Fighter II was out and then I think some other third party company, I want

437
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:30,880
to say Data East, put out a game called like Fighting Streets or something like that. Was

438
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,280
it Fighter's History? Okay. They used the Street Fighter engine. And they got sued and

439
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,060
all this stuff? I think it's because they used the Street Fighter engine. Did they?

440
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,760
But I would think, you know, that whole look and feel thing will come to play. I mean obviously

441
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,960
none of us want to see this step many people get sued, but you know it's just, it's a question

442
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,420
that has to be asked. Why hasn't it happened yet? Especially if Konami wants to be competitive

443
00:28:48,420 --> 00:29:00,880
in the PC market. Angel. Yes, Angel. Puppy just pointed out in the chatroom that Step

444
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,840
Mania is open source code, so I mean he's got a point there. Okay, that's a good point.

445
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:14,840
Which is what Jamie just pointed out, so you know. It's open source, so even if they did

446
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:20,740
get sued, it's kind of like, it doesn't matter at this point because the cat's already out

447
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:25,740
of the bag.

448
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,740
Interesting thought.

449
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:30,860
How do you guys think the online play is going to work?

450
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,380
Is there anything you guys would like to see online for DDR?

451
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:38,500
Because I think that whole being able to play with somebody at the same time, it's kind

452
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,940
of stupid because you can't see them.

453
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,940
What would you see?

454
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,300
the second side of your screen getting perfect good boo

455
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:50,580
i think you'll see fifty wasted dollars coming out of your check everyone

456
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:55,180
spending on xbox live the biggest piece of bullshit ever

457
00:29:55,180 --> 00:30:00,860
thank you for that happy comment mister brad

458
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:04,240
uh...

459
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,020
okay so we've got DDR xbox out of the way

460
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:12,020
How about Karaoke Revolution? What do you guys think of this?

461
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,160
This is kind of the...

462
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,160
I hate karaoke, so...

463
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,960
You hate karaoke? Yeah, because I don't sing, remember? I cry.

464
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,920
I like watching other people so I can make fun of them, but I don't like doing it.

465
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,300
This is interesting, though, because it's the first...

466
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:30,640
it's kind of the first U.S.-only Bomani game.

467
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,060
Kind of? Yeah, they haven't made any... well, I mean, they have games like it in Japan, but not Konami,

468
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,580
and not in the Bomani series.

469
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,880
I'm sorry? I thought they had a karaoke revolution machine or something.

470
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,480
The closest thing they have to a karaoke revolution machine, I remember seeing

471
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,560
this, it was a DDR slash karaoke machine.

472
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,680
Yeah, it was like both.

473
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,400
But who could follow that? You know what I saw at Network the other day?

474
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,720
What? Aerobics Revolution.

475
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,280
Oh yeah, that finally came out, huh? I was tempted to pick it up, but it was like

476
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,500
seventy five dollars and more expensive.

477
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,920
And if I was going to pay seventy five dollars in the game, I would have picked up Final Fantasy X-2.

478
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:12,360
You know, it's like aerobics revolution wouldn't even be worth it. I saw a bunch of screenshots of it and it looks

479
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,280
Really kind of odd loses. So this is the whole point. I mean really seriously

480
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:23,620
It is like they just like they said you're doing some 80s James Fonda kind of kind of thing to it

481
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:28,040
It's got like some chicks on it. You know, you're trying to follow their moves as you're stepping on the pad

482
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:34,780
Well, you know basically yeah, you're doing aerobics stuff and you just so happen to be standing on a pad too while you're doing it

483
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:43,400
What was that song that we figured out was confirmed for Karaoke Revolution?

484
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,380
We figured out there's some Jennifer Love Hewitt song we figured out by the screen captures

485
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:51,940
that's going to be in it for sure.

486
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,820
We found out the other day and we forgot already.

487
00:31:54,820 --> 00:32:00,940
But Jennifer Love Hewitt was there at E3 singing.

488
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:15,720
We are going to go ahead and take a quick break and when we come back we will talk about

489
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:21,820
more of E3 and we will do the fuck you's of the week so you can send those to me over

490
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,260
private messages in the chat room.

491
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:26,740
My name is Sky and you can send those to me and if you are not in our chat room you should

492
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,740
be.

493
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:32,260
Go to www.calibomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on Chat.

494
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:38,180
So we'll talk a little more about E3 and all that garbage when we get back.

495
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,180
Enjoy!

496
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:33,300
I feel it, I feel it, I feel it You are the only one, let's leave it all this way

497
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:56,300
I feel it, I feel it, I feel it You are the only one that makes me feel this way

498
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:03,300
Follow the sun, follow the sun And even the rain behind

499
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:17,300
Together we'll be in harmony Taking the time, we will find our way

500
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:26,300
Sometimes I feel your energy, I need some time But I'm on my way now

501
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:30,300
Sometimes don't you hide away I want some time

502
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,300
You should never stay

503
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:47,300
I feel the energy I need sometimes

504
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,300
But it's not on me now Sometimes

505
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,300
Don't you hide away I want sometimes

506
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,300
Each and every day Sometimes

507
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,300
I feel the energy I need sometimes

508
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,300
But it's not on me now Sometimes

509
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:07,300
I'm going to hide away, I want some time, I'm feeling every day

510
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:38,300
And that's the end of the video, thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.

511
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:21,780
Welcome back, everybody.

512
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:27,640
We decided to play some Happy Ray-var songs in that last break, so we hope you enjoyed.

513
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,800
We also figured out what song it is that's going to be in Karaoke Revolutions, called

514
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,760
Hey Everybody.

515
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,560
It's from Jennifer Love Hewitt Gay.

516
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,920
And I'm sure it sucks, but how did you find that song?

517
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:45,400
Based off of the lyrics that are showing the screen caps on the Konami website, actually.

518
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:51,400
They have a few pictures up that are from the E3 showings, so I've got it off of that.

519
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,400
And then you did a lyric search and there you go. Amazing.

520
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:04,400
But, um, it was during the break, somebody, I think it was, I don't know if it was Garrett or somebody commented that the chick in Karaoke Revolution in the screenshots looks like an American Idol reject.

521
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,400
She actually, you know what she looks like? Has anybody ever played the Spice World video game for PlayStation?

522
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,400
Oh God, that game sucks.

523
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,960
When they have the giant head and the little anorexic body, that's what that chick looked

524
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,960
like to me.

525
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,320
I'm hoping everybody was moaning and groaning because they haven't played it and they're

526
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,320
sad that you're the only one who has.

527
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,320
Don't cry for me.

528
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,520
I don't want to know that all these people have played the Spice World game.

529
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,520
I know your girlfriend has.

530
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:34,680
I had a free rental and I wanted to see how bad it was.

531
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,680
Get this.

532
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:41,640
The first time I met my ex-girlfriend, the very first day I meet her, she's like, hm?

533
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:47,640
She said, you know, you have to see this game, and so I'm like, oh no, Spice World, what is this?

534
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:52,640
And then she showed me what was so funny about it, and yeah, it was pretty funny, but you guys must have been really drunk

535
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,640
when you first saw that game, right? Or when you thought about buying that game, Rob. You had to be drunk.

536
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,640
Oh, that's right, Rob owns that game, right?

537
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:07,640
I do own that game. It's in a deep... I think it's in my closet. I'm going to have to go take it out at some point.

538
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,300
uh... so you know what else is an lc greater rather get what about other cool

539
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,520
games is non balmani necessarily that you're looking forward to

540
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,860
i know brad had one

541
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:20,980
brad tell me about some games you're looking forward to the agree not

542
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,420
necessarily the money

543
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,140
uh...

544
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,140
can only suffer just anything

545
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:29,100
and anything okay uh... half-life to

546
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,340
uh...

547
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,780
no you're sold three

548
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:36,780
The weird voice acting?

549
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,780
What's the weird voice acting?

550
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,780
What's the weird voice acting?

551
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:45,780
Yes, but it's not as bad as DIE, MONSTER. You don't belong in this world.

552
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:49,780
They need to do another Dracula X game with Richter.

553
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:54,780
A new Gradius game, definitely. Mario Kart Double Dash.

554
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:59,780
There's a new Sam & Max game.

555
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,780
Really?

556
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:05,780
New Sam & Max game, New Full Throttle game from LucasArts.

557
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,780
Who cares about that game?

558
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:15,780
Uh, let's see what else. There's, um... I don't know. There's cool games.

559
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,780
Mario Party 5, bitches.

560
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:24,780
Mario Adv- Mario Advance 4, Super Mario Bros. 3.

561
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:29,780
Or the new, um, Pokemon Stadium on GameCube.

562
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,780
Huh? Huh?

563
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,780
Metroid Pro Mission.

564
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:36,780
Oh, yeah, the new Metroid!

565
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,780
Really?

566
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:45,780
really

567
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,800
neopets

568
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,680
or that's right in coming out on the issue

569
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,940
of god

570
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:55,260
the world is ending

571
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:59,740
the end of a million copies of that army game

572
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,100
that's not really an army put out

573
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,600
the u s army another game

574
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,600
they put out a game on pc a while back uh...

575
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:14,600
to

576
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,760
Doom 3 is gonna be horrible

577
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,360
says somebody. Doom 3 is gonna be horrible

578
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:49,080
Why is Doom 3 gonna be horrible?

579
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,480
I don't know. Because the person doesn't like first-person shooters? I don't know.

580
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,000
That's fine. If you don't like first-person shooters, I don't expect you to like it, but as far as first-person shooters

581
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,600
concerned, it's gonna be freakin' great.

582
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,160
I played the Alpha League. It is incredible.

583
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,600
It runs like shit on my computer, but it's great. This is the justification.

584
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,600
No multiplayer, and it's going to be completely linear.

585
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:13,600
Well, Brad, then play Unreal Tournament or Quake 3.

586
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,600
That's what those are for.

587
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,600
They make Doom for online play. They never did in the first place.

588
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:23,600
The reason why Doom 3 is going to be shitty is because they've spent too goddamn long on it.

589
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,600
I am 20.

590
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:32,600
I remember my friend showing me previews of this when they had, you know, like at conventions with movies of it,

591
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:44,600
When I was a sophomore in high school, it's kind of gotten outdated because when they had their brilliant engine back then and it looked gorgeous, now it looks like shit.

592
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:54,600
It still does look gorgeous. I mean, that happens with a lot of games. Look at Dragon Quest VII. That has been in the making for five, six years.

593
00:42:54,600 --> 00:43:11,120
I actually had an issue of New Type where they had a review of Dragon Quest VII that

594
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:17,080
was two years old.

595
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:22,120
I want them to do like another Secret of Mana using sprites.

596
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:26,120
Oh, then again, we have Ragnarok, so what else do we need?

597
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:44,120
Yeah, Sword of Mana, which, like, they call it over here, it's the redo of the Seiken Densetsu game, the first one that was called Final Fantasy Adventure on Game Boy, which is a great game, you know, but this one looks, they updated it to make it look more like Seiken Densetsu 3, so, mmm, looks awesome.

598
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:49,620
That's what I need to say, Condensa23. I'm a GBA. That'd make me happy.

599
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:52,120
All they need to do is slap the ROM on there, there you go.

600
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:59,620
Yeah, well, they do have the Flash Advance cards, if you want to spend like $250 just for the little ROM cartridge,

601
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:07,620
and then you can load ROMs with a front-loader programmer, not front-loader, a front-end program that'll emulate the ROMs for you.

602
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:13,060
I heard some other hardware things I heard about from E3, they're going to have something

603
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:16,940
they're releasing for the GBA where you can watch full motion video for like 30 minutes

604
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:17,940
on a cartridge.

605
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:22,420
Yeah, they have that already in Japan, you can get it from lick-sang.com.

606
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:26,740
But I always get it whenever I hear that website, lick-sang, sounds like something in an Asian

607
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:27,740
porno.

608
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:28,740
Lick my sang.

609
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:34,420
No, but yeah, you can get it from there, and I guess that means they're releasing it here

610
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,420
if it was at E3.

611
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:36,420
That's pretty interesting.

612
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:44,420
You know one thing I saw at Network yesterday was the Game Boy Advance player for the GameCube.

613
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:45,420
I want me one of those.

614
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:50,420
It's pretty cool. It sits on the bottom of it though. It's kind of weird.

615
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:54,420
I think there's some comments wanting to be made in the corner that haven't been made yet.

616
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,420
Jamie and I are whirring it.

617
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,420
That's okay.

618
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,420
I think it's trapped in the corner.

619
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:12,420
Well, Brad, while we were still on that topic, and not trampling it flat, if you like your single-player, first-person, linear shooters, you can go to hell. You know what? I like them. I'll join you.

620
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:19,420
I don't think I get it. I can go to hell and you'll join me? What was your point? You like linear or you don't?

621
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,420
Ah, he's making it Doom.

622
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:38,420
I remember being in college, right after graduation, going to my friend Marcy's house and playing Doom, and we'd all be like,

623
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:45,420
hurt me plenty! Thinking we were all badass. We just thought we were awesome because we could play on Nightmare.

624
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:53,420
You know, I hate to bring this up again, but why is it that I did not know, I swear I did not know, any girls that played video games until after I was out of college, long after I was out of college.

625
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,420
I played video games all throughout when I was in high school.

626
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,420
How come I didn't have friends like you?

627
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:59,420
Because you suck.

628
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:06,420
I think I was just too preppy or something, and all my friends were in a band and cheerleading and stuff.

629
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:14,420
I worked in an arcade. I was the only girl who played Tekken 3. It was Namco Arcade, so we had Tekken 3 before everybody else.

630
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:17,420
And weren't you known as the girl who played Tekken 3 who kicked all our asses?

631
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:19,420
I was known as the girl who played Tekken 3 who kicked all their asses.

632
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:22,420
I went online on DDR Freak one day.

633
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:26,420
I was randomly IMing, PMing somebody because this was right before I was going to Alabama,

634
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:30,420
trying to see who all the people were to play so I could meet up with some of them.

635
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:35,420
Because all they had in my belt at the time was a dance maniacs machine, which is the Korean crappy one.

636
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,420
I go, I forgot who else I could tell.

637
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,420
I was like, yeah, I used to work at the Namco arcade.

638
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:45,140
Weren't you that girl who used to beat everybody at Tekken 3?

639
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:48,060
And this is five years later, no, four years later.

640
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:49,060
The legacy.

641
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:51,540
But the legend still burns.

642
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,540
Oh please.

643
00:46:53,540 --> 00:47:00,740
I went back to that cyber station though and like proceeded to, it's funny seeing all these

644
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:04,180
people just sort of slapping at the dance maniacs machine and then I'm playing like,

645
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:05,180
you know, Miggle style.

646
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:06,180
It was funny.

647
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:10,100
And then so, we got a bunch of girl gamers in the room, that's cool.

648
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,100
How long have you been playing video games, Marron?

649
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:16,100
I've been playing video games since I was 10.

650
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:24,100
That's so cool. What was the first video game you remember playing?

651
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:27,100
Super Mario Brothers 2.

652
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:30,100
And then Legend of Zelda.

653
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,100
Very cool.

654
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,100
I know what my first one was.

655
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,100
What?

656
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,100
My first game was Pitfall.

657
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:40,040
on these hard choices hundred uh... i think about my neighbors across the

658
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:45,060
street were girls and they love that game they made a plan and um... kangaroo

659
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,300
kangaroo is shitty

660
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,940
uh... by me i don't think that

661
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:53,580
i played kangaroo in an arcadia godfather's pizza

662
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,100
so hot

663
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,040
i'm older

664
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,740
i remember playing a brand new donkey kong machine

665
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:02,960
i remember playing a cocktail machine and now and you i would expect to be

666
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,740
playing kongo bongo

667
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:05,460
never played it

668
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:08,460
because it's the Sega thing, but whatever. I figure maybe start a young age.

669
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:11,460
I played Space Fury and Gorf on my Colecovision.

670
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:14,460
I was going to ask Angel, since she's a girl gamer, too.

671
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:15,460
Yeah.

672
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,460
First one you remember playing.

673
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:21,460
Oh, God. It was either... Shit. What was it called?

674
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:23,460
The damn computer won.

675
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:26,460
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

676
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:30,460
The computer... No, it was Commodore. Fuck.

677
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:33,460
It was like between Commodore and Atari 2600

678
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:41,460
I've been playing since I was 3, so yeah, I've been geeky since I was 3.

679
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,460
Now this topic doesn't have to stay just for the girls, what about guys?

680
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:47,460
Now I'm in this reminiscing mode, what was the first video game you remember playing?

681
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:54,460
Another girl! I was born with a controller in my hand! I've been playing games forever!

682
00:48:54,460 --> 00:49:02,460
I was either like 4 or 5 and it was either Super Mario Brothers or Metroid, I can't remember, it was like at my neighbor's house.

683
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:07,460
Then I got my Nintendo when I was in kindergarten, and I was a freak from then on.

684
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,820
I had a Nintendo jacket in the fourth grade.

685
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:10,820
I owned you.

686
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:11,820
Dork!

687
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:14,500
That's why the girls didn't talk to you.

688
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,660
It's not because...

689
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:21,140
But, did you ever get a hold of Super Mario Bros. cereal?

690
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:25,140
Yes, Super Mario Bros. cereal was the shit.

691
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,140
What is going on?

692
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:27,140
Why is it really me?

693
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:28,140
What is she saying here?

694
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:29,140
It's...

695
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,140
It's...

696
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:31,140
Put Jamie on a mic.

697
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:38,140
Put Jamie on the mic and explain what they're eating.

698
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:03,140
No.

699
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,140
Or he goes, ouch.

700
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,140
And then he flies away.

701
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,140
And see, it had that giant trackball thing.

702
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:13,140
So one could say I was attracted to balls at a young age.

703
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,140
Wha, wha, wha?

704
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,140
Oh, god, we just lost half our listeners.

705
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:19,140
What do you know?

706
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:21,140
And gained some new ones.

707
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:23,140
Ew, it looks like...

708
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:26,140
I'm not going to eat it. It's gross looking.

709
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:28,140
Give me some squid.

710
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:30,140
It smells like punani.

711
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:32,140
I'm gonna eat it live on the air.

712
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:33,140
Alright.

713
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:35,640
Uh, I think now's a good time to get into the-

714
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,140
Wait, does anybody want to reminisce first games?

715
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,140
Because we didn't get to everybody.

716
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:39,140
Dark Tetsuya?

717
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:42,140
It does smell like Tetsuya.

718
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:44,140
Well, you know, you just...

719
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:46,140
Actually, this kind of...

720
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:48,140
It kind of reminds me of beef jerky.

721
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,140
Got it.

722
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:51,140
My favorite is beef jerky.

723
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:53,140
As for games, oh god, I don't know.

724
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:54,140
Fast food.

725
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:55,140
2600.

726
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:56,140
Oh!

727
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:59,140
Was that the one where you're the little chef, and like, if you lost, then all the food

728
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:06,140
the food would get thrown at you for size? No, no, no. Your little purple mouth thingy.

729
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:08,960
Tappin'.

730
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,260
Oh. Ooh! Rob, did you see what he did?

731
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:15,620
You got me, you just got me and Brian confused, didn't you?

732
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:20,620
No, no, I said Rob, did you see what he did? Oh, what'd he do?

733
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:25,620
You better watch out or else there's some pussy at you.

734
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:30,020
Alright, let's finish up the others in the room.

735
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,020
Eat the squid!

736
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:33,620
Fine, I'll eat the squid, but you gotta give the mic to Angel and the others so they can

737
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:34,620
finish it.

738
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:35,620
You have to eat the squid before I do that.

739
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:36,620
Alright, it looks nasty.

740
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,940
You know what it looks like?

741
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:50,220
It looks like Big League 2.

742
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:52,500
This is horrible radio.

743
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,500
AHHH!

744
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,500
This is horrible radio!

745
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,500
Give the mic to somebody in the back.

746
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,500
Yup, leave.

747
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,500
Magus, first game.

748
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:08,500
Words could not express...

749
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:16,500
Words could not express what Rob is going through right now.

750
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:20,500
This is bad radio, tell me your first game.

751
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:24,500
Oh, it tastes like burning!

752
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,500
Burnination, yes.

753
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:37,500
I'm probably the youngest here, but I still remember playing kangaroo when I was three, and then moving on to burger time when I was five.

754
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:45,500
Then it was duck cut, and then it's all downhill from there.

755
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,500
Mokey, did you get to reminisce about your first video game you remember?

756
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:22,500
Smurfs, I used to love the Smurfs game, because that was easy.

757
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,500
The Smurfs game was weird.

758
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:30,500
I used to love to make the Smurfs fall, because they're stupid.

759
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,500
What else?

760
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,500
There was this one that, I can't remember.

761
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,500
I have a trackball.

762
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:39,500
But yeah, pretty much just Frenzy was cool.

763
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,500
Oh!

764
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,500
Ooh!

765
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,500
Jumpman!

766
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,500
I love Jumpman.

767
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:51,500
So Rob, now that you've had squid, do you feel like...

768
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:56,500
Okay, I'm going to share this real fast, and we're going to get into the nephews of the week.

769
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,500
I've had, what is it, calamari?

770
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:02,500
I love calamari, it's good. That, not good.

771
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,500
That's like beef jerky, but it's squid.

772
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,500
How can you, I'm just watching Mira and she's just like,

773
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:09,500
Um, nope, nope, she's just eating it, mmm, this is good shit.

774
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,500
It's nasty!

775
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:16,500
Mmm, beefy, but more like squid-y.

776
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,500
More like pussy!

777
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:24,500
I'm expecting it to, like, explode in my mouth or something. Anyway, I'm glad nobody caught that.

778
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:36,500
Alright, alright, let's settle down, children, because it's time for Jamie to burninate with the, uh, FUs of the week.

779
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:40,500
But the soul, the soul still burninates.

780
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,500
My mouth is full of squid.

781
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,500
Alright, you ready, Jamie?

782
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,500
No.

783
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:50,500
Since it's our season premiere, we should remind the listeners what the FUs of the week are all about.

784
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,500
It's where we take all the shit that pisses us off and say, fuck you.

785
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,500
Okay.

786
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,500
How was that?

787
00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:03,500
The chat room is begging and pleading us to keep it under control this week and not go on for an hour, so.

788
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:06,060
So let's try and regulate ourselves, boys and girls.

789
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:09,980
If you hesitate, if you hesitate too much on your FUs, the mic goes on the next person.

790
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:10,980
Agreed?

791
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:11,980
All right.

792
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:12,980
Here we go.

793
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:13,980
Here we go.

794
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:31,340
Um, my thank you of the week goes to Rob.

795
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:32,340
Thank you.

796
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:49,340
It would make you more proud to know that I was talking on my cell phone when I parked.

797
00:55:49,340 --> 00:56:05,340
Another fikey goes to Julie's car for smelling like dust and rotten milk and for having no working air conditioning. Or a radio that lets us change the station. Or a rear view mirror. So I had a rear view mirror and it was the side mirror. The passenger side mirror.

798
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:10,260
Thank you goes toward getting lost in San Francisco actually just toward the

799
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:15,960
whole street system in San Francisco and then toward like you know not being able

800
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:21,700
to get Final Fantasy 10 to network videos and also toward the city of

801
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:27,780
Milpitas for being weird for having like one entrance off of 101 and another one

802
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:34,780
off of 680 and had me turn around and have a nap. And then another one goes toward um

803
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:44,860
stuff. The end. And another, that's my hiccups. They're burpee hiccups, they hurt. Ew, are

804
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:54,740
you burping? Alright. That's it then? Uh huh. Okay, moving on to Loki. Oh wait, one more.

805
00:56:54,740 --> 00:57:01,740
Triscuit, we're giving you the phantom taste of cheese, but not really being cheesed.

806
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:31,740
Pier 39 is a waste of time, it's just like expensive shit, and how many stores do you really need as souvenirs for San Francisco?

807
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:35,740
I can go to any store there and buy the same shit. It really sucks.

808
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:43,740
So after that, after you do my freaking cold, because, you know, I hate being sick, and all I smell is snot.

809
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:48,740
I've smelled snot for about four days now, and that's all I smell. It's like this nasty ammonia smell.

810
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:53,740
All day long, that's all I smell is goddamn snot. Okay?

811
00:57:53,740 --> 00:58:05,740
After the stupid British chick that was performing up on the, like, uh, on the water stage, whatever that stupid stage was there, she was freaking stupid.

812
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:15,740
Her and her, like, gypsy child, I mean, freaking doing these acts up there, and people just didn't give a shit, they're just sitting there going, okay, what's the next thing on, what's the next thing on?

813
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:18,740
And then people were yelling for her to get off the stage and she's just like,

814
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:20,740
Oh, how do you like?

815
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:21,740
Oh, kid.

816
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:22,740
No, clap your whistle.

817
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,740
And it's just, it was annoying.

818
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:27,740
It was god-awful.

819
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:32,740
After using the refrigerator for having a stupid plug in the bottom there

820
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:35,740
and water being there, and I didn't know what the plug was for,

821
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:37,740
so I didn't want the water in the refrigerator,

822
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:40,740
so I pulled the plug, not thinking that the plug doesn't go anywhere

823
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:42,740
except down to the floor.

824
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:47,740
So now the floor is flooded with water from the stupid refrigerator and that sucks.

825
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:51,740
Um, F you to B3 for not giving me a freakin' badge.

826
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:55,740
I mean, God damn it, I fuckin' set up a bunch of shit for you guys.

827
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:59,740
Like the whole, like, you know, feed for that stupid camera and all that shit.

828
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:01,740
I got the damn CAT5 cable.

829
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:06,740
I just spent my own God damn money to buy 50 feet of CAT5 I'm never gonna ever use again.

830
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:09,740
And, God damn it, you couldn't even give me a fucking badge?

831
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:11,740
What is wrong with you people?

832
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:14,940
and seriously and after that oh give me a free t-shirt yeah sure i really saw

833
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:16,940
that one i had to go buy my goddamn t-shirt

834
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:21,180
i don't give a shit whatever so that was awful i had to

835
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:25,420
carry my goddamn stuff two blocks to your goddamn freaking arcade which

836
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:29,260
sucked because that overpriced shit all your games suck your stupid time

837
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:33,820
crisis games suck your stupid fucking um got it i can't

838
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,940
remember it's a stupid gun game that the goddamn

839
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:41,660
thing wasn't calibrated right i'm firing off the screen and saying dead center

840
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:45,660
That was, uh, yeah, House of the Dead, because I wanted to play that.

841
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:47,660
Yeah, House of the Dead fucking sucks.

842
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:50,660
By the way, though, your initial being a machine was the shit.

843
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:52,660
Yeah, but everything else was shit, okay?

844
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:55,660
Boy, there was that goddamn huge...

845
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:58,660
The roller coaster machine was the shit.

846
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:04,660
And what the hell is that? We're having, like, a stupid shooting rage right next to where we're frickin' performing for frickin' DDR.

847
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:05,660
So every now and then you hear this,

848
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:07,660
YEAH!

849
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:09,660
And people are like, what the hell's that screaming noise?

850
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:10,660
So that sucked.

851
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:16,660
And finally, the biggest one of them all, the biggest F.D. of the week, is going to PayPal.

852
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:20,660
PayPal overcharged my account by $600 fucking dollars.

853
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:23,660
Okay, beware of PayPal.

854
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:32,660
I wanted to pay for an auction that was $5.99 plus $4.25 shipping for a grand total of $10.24.

855
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:33,660
What did I get?

856
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:41,660
I had it instead charge me $599 and 425 shipping for a grand total of $603.25.

857
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:47,660
There's nothing that PayPal can do, so I had to end up contacting my guy, which made my account overdraft,

858
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:57,660
which also caused a bunch of my other auctions to overdraft my account even more, so now I have to pay finance charges of about $180.

859
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:07,660
I have to sell off my DVD collection to fix that. Thank you PayPal for ruining my whole fucking week.

860
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:32,660
And the thing is, if you're sick on a weekday, that's cool because you can miss work.

861
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:38,660
But being sick on a weekend, that just sucks because now you have to work and you have to waste your weekend lying in bed going,

862
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:41,660
I hate my life and I want to die.

863
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:44,660
But I do have a good point out of all this.

864
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:47,660
Coldies, whoever invented coldies, pure fucking genius.

865
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:51,660
I'm already on the other end of my cold and I was never like super duper ill.

866
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:54,660
Coldies are the bomb and I recommend everybody take them.

867
01:01:54,660 --> 01:02:01,660
You should have been listening to me from day one, because I've always told you just take zinc and vitamin C and you'll feel better. That's exactly what's in that shit.

868
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:02,660
Yeah, I know.

869
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:08,660
But it's called coldies, and it tastes like cherries.

870
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:14,660
No, they do taste like butt. I'll agree.

871
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:18,660
It tastes like the shitty rear end of a SARS victim.

872
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:22,660
Yeah, F you to the taste of coldies. That's awful.

873
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:28,660
Alright, let's move on to the other folks in the room, starting off with Maren!

874
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:35,660
I would like to say F you to my car, since the alternator, like, exploded or something and we had to replace it.

875
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:40,660
F you to McCarran International Airport for making me take off my shoes so they could x-ray them.

876
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:45,660
And F you to guys who step on your feet and do not apologize and are rude.

877
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:48,660
And that's about it. Other than that, it was a good week.

878
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:54,660
Yeah, and the guys who step on your feet and smell bad and can't work the soft serve ice cream machine.

879
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:57,660
So yeah.

880
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:03,660
Let's move on. I'm going to move on and get Brad to go here.

881
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:06,660
Is this my song?

882
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:08,660
It's a different song every week.

883
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:15,660
Anyway, I have to go to sailors because, I mean, I love Varian's dad and all, but he wanted to play.

884
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:43,660
he was in the navy, you know, he's retired. He played, he had to do a drinking game, sailor style, like sailor rules, and you had 60 seconds to drink your shot, and he went in a round of three people. And I probably had somewhere around 11 or 12 shots in the round last night. And I didn't get sobered up until about 2 p.m. today. So, sailor stuff, there we go.

885
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:44,660
Yes.

886
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:45,660
Dead air!

887
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:46,660
Oh, sorry.

888
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:47,660
Ah.

889
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:48,660
My...

890
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:49,660
Okay, okay.

891
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:56,320
My FUD goes to not having that stupid DWI finish I wanted in the Season 3 premiere.

892
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:59,700
I was hoping to have it finished by then.

893
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:03,320
And F not being able to sleeve, because I had nowhere to sleeve, but that was probably

894
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,320
my fault.

895
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,320
So, yeah.

896
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,320
FUD to myself.

897
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:07,320
Okay.

898
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,320
Angel.

899
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:11,320
I'd like to say FUD to my boss again, because he almost said he was going to be dead.

900
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:15,320
I'd like to say F.U. to my boss again because she's almost in Gimmie the weekend off.

901
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:16,320
Ow.

902
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,320
I gave him that flash.

903
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,320
F.U. to the flash.

904
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,320
Um, yeah, okay.

905
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,320
Yeah, so I almost didn't get to come here, see?

906
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,320
That wasn't good.

907
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,320
So, F.U. to that.

908
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:33,320
Alright, moving on to Magus.

909
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:38,320
Yeah, first of all, F.U. to the Sacramento R.T. bus system.

910
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:43,980
They don't know how to run their bus throughout Arden. We were trying to get from my high school

911
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:48,600
To Arden for a mall go see like make some love and stuff

912
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:53,120
Apparently we make it to the light rail station and

913
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:55,520
well

914
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,520
Bus does a show for an hour and a half

915
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:01,960
so we took the long walk from Arden Fulton to

916
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,480
The mall

917
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:07,480
in the burning heat

918
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:28,480
Second of all, we leave on Thursday right before Memorial Day weekend. We expect no one to be on the road. We're an hour and a half late coming into the Bay Area.

919
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:31,480
Fuck those stupid drivers!

920
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:34,480
When again, we were one of the stupid drivers.

921
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:35,480
Math.

922
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:36,480
Naturalist.

923
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,480
He was.

924
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:42,480
A few of the Chinese food places that play Outbreak while you're trying to eat.

925
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,480
That's kind of funny.

926
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,480
I don't know if I give an FU, that's funny.

927
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:50,480
A Chinese food place that plays Outbreak, the movie Outbreak.

928
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:54,480
It happened to be Silver Garden, thank you very much.

929
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:55,480
Here we go.

930
01:05:55,480 --> 01:06:02,480
cuz he forgot them cuz they were fucked up

931
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:27,980
Okay, let's move on to the chatroom FUs then.

932
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:30,980
Hey, not bad you guys, I only took 20 minutes to get through ours.

933
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:33,280
Usually it takes an hour.

934
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:36,980
Okay, Mandarin would like to say,

935
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:40,580
fuck the Orange Lounge radio host that don't wish me a happy birthday.

936
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:41,980
Happy birthday.

937
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:44,180
Today's her birthday.

938
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:45,880
Happy birthday.

939
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:49,580
Well, FU for not being here to get spankings, girl.

940
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:53,780
Fuck stupid managers at Yardbirds that make my girlfriend work on my birthday.

941
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:56,640
fuck real radio stations like ninety four nine whoever played this song

942
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,000
whatever song that was

943
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,760
uh... let's see fuck people who say fuck too fucking much

944
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,400
uh...

945
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:07,400
but my roommates ex-girlfriend because she's a controlling bitch

946
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:11,640
who won't let my roommate be gay or at least trying as hard as she can

947
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:12,720
don't be gay

948
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:16,960
don't be gay sparky don't be gay

949
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,720
moving on

950
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:22,560
uh... justin b would like to say f you to rob and jamie at the beginning of the

951
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:26,700
show when Jamie was coughing up her lungs. Because the comment you made and Jamie coughing

952
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:35,700
made me spit soda slash hot dog out of my mouth. And now we just had a laugh at your

953
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:45,960
expense. That was the win. Ninst would like to say F56K connections who keep buffering

954
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:51,180
Orange Lounge Radio. Stupid kids who think they can play DDR when they can't pass beginner

955
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:54,860
their songs, moving out at the end of the college year, my professor from my coding

956
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:59,260
class, he didn't show up with a final until an hour after he should have, one more time

957
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:04,040
my modem and being a 56k connection, people who decide to take slow drives on country

958
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:08,800
roads on Sundays, you drive too slow and keep other people from where they need to be, people

959
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:13,700
who don't like Matrix Reloaded, they had to think somewhat because they had to think somewhat,

960
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:18,260
and to close it off my 56k connection to my ISP should die, oh one more, F you to my brother's

961
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:22,640
roommate, you are the laziest bastard I've ever seen, and F.U. to Radio Shack. They overcharge

962
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:26,460
on everything. Why can't there be a decent electronic shop around here?

963
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:30,620
That was two more. Yeah, that was like two or three more. God,

964
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:34,460
everybody's got a marathon today. Okay, DJ Tyrant would like to say, F.U.s to the internet

01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:48,840
the event or a for being an ass to the new arcade electric avenue and it's

968
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:51,980
taking forever for them to get their license f you to school for just sucking

969
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:53,900
i don't want to go

970
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:56,380

01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:59,700

01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:10,140
fuck horrible sleep cycles fuck boredom and laziness

975
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:13,300
i spent about ninety percent of this weekend thus far sitting on my computer

976
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:17,780
but the he writing a bike across town in ninety five degree heat is not fun

977
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:21,700
but the holiday for keeping the dining halls closed next today so i can't be the

978
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:24,740

like you get a decent meal in dorms anyway what's up with that

980
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:33,080
moving on

981
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:34,880
john fields would like to say

982
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:38,220
f u sony for making the p s two with such cheap parts

983
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:41,660
discrete error discrete error i'm so freaking tired of turning my playstation

984
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:46,300
2 upside down and spinning it all around to get it to read the disc. Also FU to server

985
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:50,500
ops to take their job way too seriously and let nothing go by and then lying about giving

986
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:54,880
warnings and thus ban someone without them realizing what they were doing was wrong despite

987
01:09:54,880 --> 01:10:04,600
of how insignificant the problem was. Vandalus would like to say an FU. FU to my Cadillac

988
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:09,760
for having a leaky radiator.

989
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:14,960
Arkadian42 would like to say fuck you to the person who scraped my rear car door in the

990
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,900
Scandia parking lot and dented it in slightly.

991
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:20,800
Now the window of that door won't go down all the way anymore.

992
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,560
Fucking hit and run bitches.

993
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:29,020
And lastly, Muhimer would like to say fuck me for not being here and submitting late.

994
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:32,280
Fuck not having the internet for two weeks because of McGaffey Firewall.

995
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:33,280
Fuck homophobes.

996
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:38,000
But yay for 50 Cent DDR Extreme, 10 minutes away finally, oh, and thank God for acupuncture

997
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,840
curing my allergies.

998
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,240
Allergies.

999
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:46,600
Hooray, that's everybody's F.U. of the Week.

1000
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:50,880
So, any last bits of bitterness?

1001
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:55,320
Loki, you have something new that's going to be coming to the show that I see you just

1002
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:56,320
got?

1003
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:59,200
Do you want to share with our listeners what you just want?

1004
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:05,200
Yeah, I actually found this when I was looking for Dance Sense Revolution stuff.

1005
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:11,200
You know, normally I look for the arcade discs and stuff, and this just happened to be pulled up in an eBay auction.

1006
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:21,200
So, I won a hentai cosplay, actually it's a cosplay porn featuring DDR characters.

1007
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:28,200
So yes, we have DDR porn.

1008
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,200
Will we get to play that on the show?

1009
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,200
Of course.

1010
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,200
Yay!

1011
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:34,200
Oh, yay.

1012
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,200
Don't sound too excited, Jamie.

1013
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,200
No, I'm actually kind of curious.

1014
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:40,200
Is it going to be like Final Fuck X?

1015
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,200
I hope.

1016
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,200
I hope it's not all blurred out and shit.

1017
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:46,200
Will there be pantsless rage?

1018
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,200
It'll be just like Final Fuck X.

1019
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,200
Where did my afghan go?

1020
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,200
That's why I'm curious.

1021
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:54,200
It's like disappeared.

1022
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:55,200
Oh, there it is.

1023
01:11:55,200 --> 01:12:00,380
It ran away from all the people!

1024
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:07,700
By the way, I like these chairs because I can sit really sideways in them.

1025
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:12,620
OK, we're gonna take a quick break, and we're gonna come back and do the cage match in a

1026
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:13,620
little bit.

1027
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:20,220
But first we're gonna hear some Kylie from the Euromega mix, and then we'll hear something

1028
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:23,280
from Poppin' Music.

1029
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:29,280
And last message, because Jamie wants to hear it, so we'll be right back boys and girls, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1030
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:57,280
Thought that I was going crazy

1031
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:01,280
Just after one of those days, yeah

1032
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:04,280
Didn't know what to do

1033
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:08,280
Then there was you again

1034
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:11,280
And everything went so wrong tonight

1035
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:15,280
And the stars, they must get out this time

1036
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:19,280
The music they were playing really blew my mind

1037
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:38,280
Cause baby, when I heard you were in love first I knew you were meant to be in love

1038
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:10,280
If you miss that beat

1039
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:12,280
The king and the chef go marching

1040
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:16,280
It's time to say goodbye to my fate

1041
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,280
I want you to know

1042
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:22,280
I'm ready to be happy

1043
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:23,280
It's my time

1044
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:25,280
I need to face that

1045
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,280
Bad things for you

1046
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:30,280
You don't have to let me get to see

1047
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,280
I don't need you

1048
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:34,280
Bad things for you

1049
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:35,280
I can take you somewhere

1050
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,280
I don't need you anymore

1051
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:46,280
I'm running out of time, wait, where are you?

1052
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:56,280
I don't know what I'm feeling

1053
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:59,280
But I can feel it inside

1054
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:02,280
I don't know what to say

1055
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:05,280
But I can feel it inside

1056
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:09,280
I'm not living in reality

1057
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,280
I'm a loser

1058
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:14,280
Most of all, I've made up my mind

1059
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:16,280
For this part of my life

1060
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:18,280
To say that

1061
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:20,280
That's it for you

1062
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:22,280
You don't have to love me

1063
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:24,280
Can't you see you're going to love me

1064
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:26,280
That's it for you

1065
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:28,280
I can't let you go

1066
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:30,280
I don't want you anymore

1067
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:32,280
That's it for you

1068
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:37,280
You, you don't have to love me, can't you see I'm going to love you

1069
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:41,280
I said, for you, I can make you go where I go

1070
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,280
Anymore

1071
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:34,280
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

1072
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:59,680
your pick is pretty, well we'll see, you'll see what the songs are going to be in a little

1073
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,680
bit.

1074
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:03,500
But they're all pretty good.

1075
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:05,740
I know which songs I've heard all these songs, they're all pretty good.

1076
01:19:05,740 --> 01:19:08,420
They're all the kind of music that our chat room seems to like, so those of you that yell

1077
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:11,460
at us for peaking crap have nothing to complain about this week.

1078
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:16,260
They said it picks show tunes.

1079
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:18,460
Masquerade, Paper Faces, I'm very...

1080
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:22,320
Anyway, I thought I'd open the floor up for story time, because I know a lot of people

1081
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:23,940
had stories they wanted to tell tonight.

1082
01:19:23,940 --> 01:19:29,460
So Jamie, you want to kick it off, why don't you tell us about how you've been burninating

1083
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:30,460
this weekend with Maren.

1084
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:31,460
Oh God, where's Maren?

1085
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:37,460
It starts off with me at work at 5.30 in the morning.

1086
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:38,460
I work all day.

1087
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:39,460
Do you want storytime music?

1088
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:40,460
Sure.

1089
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:41,460
Isao-kun.

1090
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:50,460
Oh, yeah, I have to play the music that came to us from the Hamster Alliance because Loki

1091
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:51,460
liked it.

1092
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:52,460
I don't remember which one it is.

1093
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:53,460
I think it's this one.

1094
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:54,460
Okay.

1095
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:55,460
Rob, do you have any cookies?

1096
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:56,460
Do I have what?

1097
01:19:56,460 --> 01:20:15,420
I get off work and I go right over to Jessica's house and there's somebody waiting for me

1098
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:18,940
there sitting on the couch which is still set up theater style seating for watching

1099
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:27,180
movies on the wall so we went and what do we do we went out to the south sack

1100
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:33,020
for boba then we went to roseville for sushi then we went back to my house and

1101
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:39,280
decided to watch battle royale I got no I got my battle royale manga first

1102
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:45,700
because we went to em a1 comics and then we watched battle royale and your

1103
01:20:45,700 --> 01:20:54,400
I think it would have been better if Dan wasn't doing, you know, director's commentary

1104
01:20:54,400 --> 01:21:04,180
during the last half of it, but it was pretty interesting.

1105
01:21:04,180 --> 01:21:05,180
Moving on.

1106
01:21:05,180 --> 01:21:07,460
Um, paper plate, okay?

1107
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:13,540
This joke ends right now, okay?

1108
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:30,060
The plate has been retired. I have a new weapon. It's called the smell of pussy. Or squid.

1109
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:31,140
Janae, put your pants on.

1110
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:42,580
We ended up crashing out.

1111
01:21:42,580 --> 01:21:51,120
I woke up at the ass crack of dawn, like 8.30 in the morning, and you were still asleep.

1112
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:53,580
I went back to bed.

1113
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:57,380
Got up around 9.30, we bummed around, and then tried to get out of the door, but I kept

1114
01:21:57,380 --> 01:21:59,280
forgetting stuff.

1115
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:07,240
We finally get in Julie's car that smells like granny panties, the smell of dust and

1116
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:09,240
rotten milk.

1117
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:17,720
We had a really nice drive going into San Francisco and then I got lost because I forgot

1118
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:20,160
to turn on Van Ness.

1119
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:27,760
Through some direction and just some random turning, we make it to Gary and get there.

1120
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:35,760
Go shopping, have good food, um, I almost bought Sara's mask, but decided against it.

1121
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:43,760
And then we, um, we managed to get to a, to a network video with no problem, except for the guy behind me who wanted to kill me.

1122
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:47,760
This guy had this big vehicle, I swear he was like the worst driver in the world.

1123
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:59,380
But anyway, so the next thing, we get on the 101 South again to go to network.

1124
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:01,420
And it turns out he gave us directions to Sunnyvale

1125
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:03,900
because we were trying to get to Milpitas instead.

1126
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:09,980
So I got directions from Shark's Girl, from my wifey-poo.

1127
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:14,660
And we managed to get to Milpitas, Scotland, race to lead horses.

1128
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:17,180
And then we came back and said, hey, we want some boba.

1129
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:20,180
So we went to Davis, got...

1130
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:22,180
What the fuck is this music?

1131
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:24,180
It's story-type music!

1132
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:27,180
Okay, this music needs to go away.

1133
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:29,180
It's okay, but it doesn't fit my story.

1134
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:32,180
Do you want the violins again?

1135
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:36,180
This is some burninating music.

1136
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:39,180
Okay.

1137
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:43,180
And then we got back to my place.

1138
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:47,180
And we were gonna have pizza, but we sort of just didn't make it.

1139
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:50,180
We watched, um, we played some Soulcalibur 2.

1140
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:57,180
And I got my ass handed to me repeatedly every time, um, Maran picked, um, Taki.

1141
01:23:57,180 --> 01:24:01,180
Of course, it turned out that I was, like, super cheap with-

1142
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:04,180
Who was I super cheap with?

1143
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:06,180
Uh, well, I was- I'm always cheap-

1144
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:09,180
No, it was Seungmino when I pulled out Seungmino instead of Kilik.

1145
01:24:09,180 --> 01:24:10,180
I was really cheap.

1146
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:12,180
And with, um, Eunseung.

1147
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:17,180
I was, I sucked with Link. Then we watched from Shaman King, but she fell asleep.

1148
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:21,180
So I was like, WAKE UP! Go upstairs, cause Dan wants the Goucher!

1149
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:28,180
So, so she goes to sleep and I'm playing Ragnarok until 1.30 in the morning, and then the end.

1150
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:33,180
And then there's today, where we just like, sat around the house like, most of the morning.

1151
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:38,180
And then, um, what else happened?

1152
01:24:38,180 --> 01:24:51,180
We went to the mall, went to Fresh Choice, where the stupid man was who smelled funny and stuck on my foot, and then we went to see Rob- not Rob, we went to see Dan at work.

1153
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:59,180
So I'm here just mumbling in the background. Mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble.

1154
01:24:59,180 --> 01:25:01,900
the orgy plans with more

1155
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:03,920
and then uh...

1156
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:05,120
and then

1157
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:06,160
went back to my house

1158
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:06,940
after

1159
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:07,920
going to

1160
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:12,240
the half of half of filtrid

1161
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:14,520
and then the liberal right now

1162
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:17,740
and then we can be

1163
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:19,060
and tomorrow we're going to get

1164
01:25:19,060 --> 01:25:21,160
printed mongrel

1165
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:23,440
as she made a horse and tried work

1166
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,680
tells about trying to work

1167
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:35,320
Chogdor is a man, Chogdor is a horse man, well really he's just a horse, but still he's

1168
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:37,320
Chogdor.

1169
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:44,000
That just got a jazz!

1170
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,600
Anybody else have something they want to share for us on Storytime?

1171
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:52,720
I know that they did over there.

1172
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:55,320
First of all, I have pie.

1173
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:57,320
You don't have cake pie, you have apple pie.

1174
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:59,320
But I still have pie.

1175
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,320
Whatever.

1176
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:03,320
Music.

1177
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:05,320
Get some Chinese music or something.

1178
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:07,320
I didn't mean that in a bad way, but yeah.

1179
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:09,320
Just tell your damn story.

1180
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:11,320
It's the super garden thing.

1181
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:13,320
I know.

1182
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:15,320
And I think I pretty much said it.

1183
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:17,320
Oh, because of the outbreak thing they were playing?

1184
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:19,320
Well then why did you raise your hand?

1185
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:21,320
I don't know.

1186
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:23,320
Never mind.

1187
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:29,320
I did a very, very obsessive thing last night.

1188
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:30,320
What's that?

1189
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:31,320
Friday night.

1190
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:35,140
I watched Battle Royale and read the manga while watching the movie.

1191
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:36,140
You're sick.

1192
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:39,140
That's cool, Jamie.

1193
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:40,140
Yay.

1194
01:26:40,140 --> 01:26:44,000
Does anybody have any interesting Bimani stories or Bimani accomplishments they want to name

1195
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
for the week?

1196
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
I passed another 2DX on.

1197
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Whoo!

1198
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Yay!

1199
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Which one?

1200
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Foundation something.

1201
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:58,000
I thought you were going to say shades, dammit!

1202
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:07,140
My only accomplishment this week is the fact that

1203
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:11,000
there's the remix contest going on over on BomaniStyle

1204
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,000
and uh...

1205
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,680
I can't play DWR

1206
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:16,440
can't play Semenya and talk at the same time

1207
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:30,440
Anyways, there's a competition going on over at BomaniStyle.com. It's a remix contest, and both entries up, the Dark Black Forest, the Midnight Angel mix, and Legend of Trance are over there.

1208
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:39,440
So, everybody is listening. What you need to go do is you need to go over to BomaniStyle.com. Go to their forums. If you're not a member, sign up. It'll only take a second.

1209
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:43,440
You go down to the very bottom, and you'll see Bomani Cell Remixing Contest Volume 1.

1210
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:46,440
What you want to do once you're there, is you want to find my entry.

1211
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:49,440
There'll be a thread that says, Legend of Trance by Loki.

1212
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:52,440
You go there, and you rate it a 10.

1213
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:55,440
Go do that right now.

1214
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,440
I'll give you a second.

1215
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:03,440
Okay. Now that you've done that, I'll win.

1216
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:06,440
Okay. No, but really, um, go there and listen to all the remixes.

1217
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:09,560
remixes. There's a lot of them that really suck, but then there's some that are really

1218
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:14,920
good. So, you'll know pretty much by looking at it which ones are pretty good. You've got,

1219
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:20,420
there's one DJ Demon, I believe, did Max Resurrection. We played that a while back. It's, it's pretty

1220
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:27,320
good, you know, but I still want to win. And, so go vote ten for mine, because there's just

1221
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:32,760
not enough people voting on mine, and I need people to go vote ten, just because.

1222
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:36,220
And don't just vote a ten. Vote everyone else a one. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

1223
01:28:36,220 --> 01:28:42,220
But, um, post in the thread and talk about how, like, beautiful Loki's remixes are and how his remixes make you want to fuck him.

1224
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:46,220
Just kidding, Nelly.

1225
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:47,220
She's just like, alright.

1226
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:54,220
Yeah, you can want.

1227
01:28:56,220 --> 01:28:57,220
It's nice to want.

1228
01:28:57,220 --> 01:28:59,720
But, um, yeah. There's some pretty good ones.

1229
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:05,360
The one I like though there's a really good paranoia remix in there that's a hip-hop remix of paranoia

1230
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:10,240
And we'll maybe get to play that later on in the show that's pretty good. There's a ghost one

1231
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:16,280
That's kind of a piano ambience one. It's pretty good. There's a sodeep one that's a piano ambience one. That's pretty good

1232
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:20,880
there's a long version like a trancy remix well a

1233
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:25,780
Longer trance remix of uh sodeep thats. It's alright

1234
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:44,740
I have a few remixes that I'd name that deserve ones, but I'm not going to name them on the

1235
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:45,740
air.

1236
01:29:45,740 --> 01:29:52,140
Anyway, let's get on with the cage match, shall we?

1237
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:58,140
I think our chat room has been kind of a little eager for this and and I am too. I'm moist with anticipation about this, so

1238
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:05,940
Last week for two weeks ago. I should say in the orange lounge radio cage match. I got you. I got you

1239
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:10,980
No you already you already had your one

1240
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:15,840
Loki won with something that's kind of popular

1241
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:21,720
He won with a pop culture buzz thing because it's the big thing right now, and he wrote. What are you laughing about?

1242
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:26,080
Something in the chat room DJ Tyron fucks Loki

1243
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:31,320
Anyway as I was saying

1244
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:33,560
Last week in the cage match

1245
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:39,680
Loki's pick one with this oh by the way the way the cage match works all the hosts the three of us myself Loki dark

1246
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:43,520
Sakura we all pick one song and they all fight each other per your votes

1247
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:51,520
So you vote for the song you like best, and you send those votes over to Sky in the chat room, but you can't vote until all three songs have played.

1248
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:56,520
And then the song with the most votes goes into rotation on Orange Lounge Radio until the next cage match.

1249
01:30:56,520 --> 01:31:05,520
So, here was last week's winner and the first song you can vote for tonight is Don Davis and Juno Reactor with Mona Lisa Overdrive from the movie The Matrix Reloaded. Enjoy!

1250
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:38,920
The first song you can vote for this week is Mona Lisa Overdrive, here in the Cajun

1251
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:39,920
Match.

1252
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:45,840
It's a very good scene in that movie, by the way, that was from the freeway chase scene.

1253
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:49,600
Second song is going to be Dark Sakura's pick, so why don't you tell us all about it?

1254
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:53,880
I don't even know if it's named right, it says it's from Final Fantasy X, but I don't

1255
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:54,880
think so.

1256
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:56,880
Some cool song, I don't even remember the name of it.

1257
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:29,580
And you only heard a clip of the last song because it won last time, so you only get to hear a clip.

1258
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:34,580
You get to hear the full one of this. So this is pick number two for this week. Set me free. Enjoy.

1259
01:35:59,580 --> 01:36:01,580
Oh

1260
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:05,580
That was Set Me Free, which may or may not be Final Fantasy and may or may not be Paul Oakenfold, so go figure.

1261
01:37:05,580 --> 01:37:08,580
Anybody want to comment on that and give it something on a scale of 1 to 10?

1262
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:09,580
Jamie?

1263
01:37:09,580 --> 01:37:11,580
10.

1264
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:13,580
Loki, do you have anything you want to say about it?

1265
01:37:13,580 --> 01:37:18,580
It definitely wasn't Oakenfold. It could have been a lot better than that.

1266
01:37:18,580 --> 01:37:23,580
It was all right. I couldn't place it anywhere in Final Fantasy at all.

1267
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:30,580
It was just kind of average to me. I've heard a lot of trance, second tracks. It was just average. So I'd give it a 7.

1268
01:37:31,580 --> 01:37:36,580
Yeah, I mean it's very trance in the fact that I see it as kind of like background music, but it's nothing I'd kind of be all,

1269
01:37:36,580 --> 01:37:40,580
Ooh, I gotta listen to this song, oh my god, I love this song. But like, you know, if it was planned, I'd be all,

1270
01:37:40,580 --> 01:37:45,580
Okay, yeah, I just kind of, you know, bob my head like the Roxbury guys. So, you know, I'd give it a 7.5. Cool.

1271
01:37:45,580 --> 01:37:49,580
Anybody else want to comment on Set Me Free?

1272
01:37:49,580 --> 01:37:56,580
I like it. It would probably make good background music to start from the net or something.

1273
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:57,580
Seven and a half.

1274
01:37:57,580 --> 01:37:58,580
Seven and a half.

1275
01:37:58,580 --> 01:38:00,580
Anybody over here in this corner want to comment on Set Me Free?

1276
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:01,580
Anybody? Anybody? Anybody?

1277
01:38:01,580 --> 01:38:02,580
It was okay, but...

1278
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:03,580
Is it?

1279
01:38:03,580 --> 01:38:04,580
Yeah.

1280
01:38:04,580 --> 01:38:05,580
Um...

1281
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:06,580
Do you want me to rate it?

1282
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:07,580
Yeah.

1283
01:38:07,580 --> 01:38:08,580
Um...

1284
01:38:08,580 --> 01:38:09,580
No?

1285
01:38:09,580 --> 01:38:11,580
Okay, I won't.

1286
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:12,580
You have to rate it.

1287
01:38:12,580 --> 01:38:13,580
Ugh!

1288
01:38:13,580 --> 01:38:15,580
I've been denied or something.

1289
01:38:15,580 --> 01:38:16,580
Okay, um...

1290
01:38:16,580 --> 01:38:17,580
Seven.

1291
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:18,580
Alright.

1292
01:38:18,580 --> 01:38:20,580
Alright, so, any, oh, Magus?

1293
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:25,580
Very transient, really good, like, working music if you're, like, working on some, like,

1294
01:38:25,580 --> 01:38:28,580
platform or anything like that. I'd probably give it an 8.

1295
01:38:28,580 --> 01:38:29,580
It's good burninating music.

1296
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:32,580
Yeah, oh, hacking or burninating, yeah, there we go.

1297
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:35,580
That's good music for decorating cakes, too.

1298
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:38,580
Yeah, I like that.

1299
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:42,580
Some, some cake decorating music, I like that.

1300
01:38:42,580 --> 01:38:43,580
I like driving to it.

1301
01:38:43,580 --> 01:38:46,580
Okay, any of, any other comments on Set Me Free?

1302
01:38:46,580 --> 01:38:49,580
Anybody, anybody. You could be influencing the votes.

1303
01:38:49,580 --> 01:38:51,580
Oh, oh, we have a hand.

1304
01:38:51,580 --> 01:38:55,580
Good music to refurbish cabinets, too.

1305
01:38:55,580 --> 01:38:57,580
Okay.

1306
01:38:57,580 --> 01:38:59,580
Alright, moving on.

1307
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:03,580
The third and final song in tonight's cage match is my pick.

1308
01:39:03,580 --> 01:39:09,580
And I decided to go the slutty route, and I picked a former porno star.

1309
01:39:09,580 --> 01:39:11,580
I picked Tracy Lords.

1310
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:12,580
Did I call it or did I?

1311
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:18,480
And this this song is kind of a couple years old and a lot of people know the songs from the Mortal Kombat soundtrack

1312
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:21,720
It's called control, but this is the version that has the vocals in it

1313
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:27,120
So you could be really slutty so everybody get naked because this is the song to have some sex to

1314
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:32,120
This is my pick for this week's cage match. It's Tracy Lawrence with control.

1315
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:36,120
You're such a lonely, you're such a blue You're like your lover, let me control you

1316
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:39,120
Can't surrender, you'll feel no pain

1317
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:43,120
Cause I'm the master at this game

1318
01:40:57,120 --> 01:41:00,120
Let me kill you, and make you better

1319
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:04,120
At this life, you will forget her

1320
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:07,120
Let me get it and make it better

1321
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:10,120
I'll be right here if you will forget

1322
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:12,120
Oh no no no

1323
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:14,120

1324
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:15,120
Oh no no no

1325

Let me control it

1326
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:19,120
Oh no no no

1327
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:21,120
Control it

1328
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:22,120
Oh no no no

1329
01:41:22,120 --> 01:41:24,120
Let me control it

1330
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:27,120
Come with me to the other side

1331
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:31,120
Come with me, I need to die

1332
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:34,120

Out of the lights

1349
01:42:09,820 --> 01:42:10,520
Out of the lights

1350
01:42:10,520 --> 01:42:11,720
You're up for Kenner

1351
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:12,820

1354
01:42:15,120 --> 01:42:16,120

1355
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:16,620
Out of the lights

1356
01:42:16,620 --> 01:42:17,420
Out of the lights

1357
01:42:17,420 --> 01:42:18,520
You're up for Kenner

1358
01:42:48,520 --> 01:43:03,520
Let me control it, control, let me control it

1359
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:08,520
Tracy Lourdes with Control.

1360
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:13,520
It's cool, but I've had that version for a long time myself, so for me it's kind of old.

1361
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:18,520
It still doesn't mean it's less of a good song, I'd give it a 7.5.

1362
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:41,520
I love that song because it brings you back to Q's are days, where we used to play with the Mortal Kombat soundtrack all the time, and that movie, while being a really sucky movie overall, it was good at its time. I like that song even more.

1363
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:43,520
Dark Tetsuya

1364
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:23,520
I would agree with Nico Adachi in the chatroom who says it sounds like techno stripper music. Amen. Total stripper music. Yes, another comment?

1365
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:29,520
That would be my cage dance music. Seriously, I love that. I'd give it a 10.

1366
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:31,520
So how appropriate for the cage match.

1367
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:34,520
That was really bad.

1368
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:36,520
Yeah, I know. That joke gets a 2.

1369
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:40,520
Anyway, anybody else? Any other comments on Tracy Boyer's control?

1370
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:42,520
Yeah, mine is too.

1371
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:44,520
What? Wait, what?

1372
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:46,520
I like her pornography better than our music.

1373
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:51,520
I had a really funny one though. It was like, I think, her first album that she did.

1374
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:56,520
Just about like this girl who would like to introduce these guys and then like kick your ass.

1375
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:01,520
I have to find that CD again.

1376
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:08,520

everybody wake up cage match is over

1384
01:46:10,840 --> 01:46:15,060
cage match is usually a part of a show where people in the studio fall asleep

1385
01:46:15,060 --> 01:46:18,220
i kinda have to pee but i don't want to pee because we just played a bunch of music

1386
01:46:18,220 --> 01:46:20,180
so i don't want to go to break

1387
01:46:20,180 --> 01:46:22,460

and they got

1393
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:37,340
they had this other thing over here

1394
01:46:37,340 --> 01:46:40,660

1396
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:44,620

1397
01:46:44,620 --> 01:46:46,260

01:46:46,260 --> 01:46:47,480

Prodigy

1401
01:46:50,980 --> 01:46:53,900
Ooh, it has an instrumental and acapella mix, you know what that means?

1402
01:46:53,900 --> 01:46:54,900
I can make a remix!

1403
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:59,300
There were those other three from earlier in the week.

1404

And I also got, um, what was it, I got, um, Heaven, you know, DJ Sammy, of course, Walk

01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:35,100
I've got more stuff coming in.

1412
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:42,100
I've got the whole Eddie Murphy album, including his song...

1413
01:47:42,100 --> 01:47:46,100
I forget what his song's called, but anyways, it's really funny.

1414
01:47:46,100 --> 01:47:53,280
And then I've got Frankie Goes Hollywood, Relax, and Two Tribes.

1415
01:47:53,280 --> 01:48:06,360
I've also got, well let's see here, pull up my list, let's see, I've got The Reflex, I've

1416
01:48:06,360 --> 01:48:18,720
I've got, oh shit, I'm trying to remember, just give me one second, stupid people, fucking,

1417
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:28,060
god damn it, okay, here we go, I've got BT Dreamin', it's a pretty good song, we've got

1418
01:48:28,060 --> 01:48:33,080
the Culture Club, Color by Numbers, their album, Starship Knee Deep in Hoopla, you know

1419
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:37,160
that song we built this city you've got the whole album for that and the

1420
01:48:37,160 --> 01:48:44,320
Ghostbusters soundtrack so yeah so when are you gonna start that mix show you've

1421
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:49,280
promised for about the last three months well you know I should start actually

1422
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:53,880
using my records first I need to set the other turntable second I need to learn

1423
01:48:53,880 --> 01:49:00,520
how to beat mix kind of an important part of the mix show no I seriously need

1424
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:05,520
practice. I haven't practiced at all, period. You know, drama and stuff has prevented me

1425
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:07,520
from doing so, so yeah.

1426
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:14,520
Okay, um, any other, anybody else going to start a show on Orange Lounge?

1427
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:16,520
Maybe I should start doing a Friday show.

1428
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:17,520
You what?

1429
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:18,520
Maybe I should start doing a Friday show.

1430
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:23,520
I know, I've, uh, I think I'm going to start, I've, I've, I've tossed the idea around.

1431
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:26,520
It's really inconvenient for me to do one during the week, but Fridays I could do a

1432
01:49:26,520 --> 01:49:27,520
show.

1433
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:33,520
Don't also tie yourself down, because what you can do is you can pre-tape like four in a row and then play them later.

1434
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:34,520
Why would I do that?

1435
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:35,520
If you want.

1436
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:37,520
That sort of defeats the purpose of me doing a live show.

1437
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:40,520
Well, I mean, it's up to you. If you want to do a live show, do it. But, you know, just saying.

1438
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:46,520
I'm thinking about doing a tape show about remixes and originals. Maybe. I'm kind of toying with that idea.

1439
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:48,520
Well, mine's all random crap anyway.

1440
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:49,520
Yours is going to be all random? That's cool.

1441
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:56,520
I think maybe this Friday I might do another... If I can get the samples, I need to do another video game trivia.

1442
01:49:56,520 --> 01:50:01,960
you should call it to burn innate ha ha ha no I think the burn innate joke we

1443
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:06,560
don't want we don't want to run around dating the burn innate jokes yes start

1444
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:09,560
it so yeah you don't have to raise your hand you're not in school well he has to

1445
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:13,360
get a mic though we need to get a third mic yeah we need to get espo back into

1446
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:19,560
the chat room so I can get my title back from him good point get it while he's

1447
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:22,160
not there yeah that's right you got to get it back when he's not there kick him

1448
01:50:22,160 --> 01:50:41,800
I'll tell you guys off-air what that cap is, but the rest of the people don't even know

1449
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:15,440
So, we hope you're listening to Orange Launch Radio all day long because, you know, we play

1450
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:16,440
good music.

1451
01:51:16,440 --> 01:51:17,440
Dammit.

1452
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:18,440
Huh?

1453
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:25,640
Okay, so, we're going to go to break now so I can pee and tally the votes for CAGEMATCH.

1454
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:28,800
Maggish, your vote doesn't count because you're here.

1455
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:29,800
Sorry.

01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Jamie, any requests for this break?

1459
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:41,640
Let's go with Little Red Corvette.

1460
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:42,640
You want to hear little reg?

1461
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:44,360
What does little reg corvette have to do with the money?

1462
01:51:44,360 --> 01:51:45,360
I don't care.

1463
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:46,360
It's plants.

1464
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:47,360
You're...

1465
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:48,360
Okay.

1466
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:52,800
No, I'm not reading that.

1467
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:55,960
Why don't we go with some keyboard mania stuff?

1468
01:51:55,960 --> 01:51:56,960
Okay, some keyboard mania.

1469
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:58,960
Let's go with least 100 seconds.

Okay, I can do that.

1471

1484
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:48,200

Finalize, you've got to tell me

1486
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:55,200
You know it's too late when you're dead now, man

01:56:55,200 --> 01:56:59,200
Pass it on and set me strong, man

I need to know, I need to know, I need to know how you feel

1495

I need to know, I need to know, I need to know How it feels?

1496
01:57:54,660 --> 01:58:01,660
I got to know, I got to know, I got to know If it's real

01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:25,600
I'm giving all my heart to you

01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:29,600

I purify my love for you

1509
01:58:44,600 --> 01:59:04,600
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

1510
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:07,020
Alright, we're back.

1511
01:59:07,020 --> 01:59:12,840
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, and we have the winner of this week's cage match,

1512
01:59:12,840 --> 01:59:14,180

and this is a very very close vote you guys

1514
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:20,320
the winning song only had one vote more

1515
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:22,400
than the other two songs

1516
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:25,740
so like the other two songs were tied in the winning one only had one more

1517
01:59:25,740 --> 01:59:26,740
vote than them

1518
01:59:26,740 --> 01:59:29,740
so here it is your winning song

1519
01:59:29,740 --> 01:59:36,740
once again is Mona Lisa Overdrive

1520
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:39,320
oh wait I'm sorry what did you say?

1521
01:59:39,320 --> 01:59:44,440
I say, of course, it's riding off the frickin' boom 6S and Jive or whatever, no, Pipe of

1522
01:59:44,440 --> 01:59:45,440
the Matrix, so...

1523
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:46,440
What do you expect?

1524
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:47,440
I mean...

1525
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:48,440
What are you talkin', Jive?

1526
01:59:48,440 --> 01:59:52,440
Alright, Jive, I don't know, I guess it's because of Genaise.

1527
01:59:52,440 --> 01:59:53,440
Genaise?

1528
01:59:53,440 --> 01:59:54,440
Genaise?

1529
01:59:54,440 --> 01:59:55,440
Yes?

1530
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:57,440
I hear hissing.

1531
01:59:57,440 --> 02:00:04,680
Anyway, uh, so there you go.

1532
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:08,360
Um, so, what now?

1533
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:11,100

I have to give Jamie the computer, this is bad.

1545
02:01:10,180 --> 02:01:12,180
Here.

1546
02:01:12,180 --> 02:01:16,180
This is fucked up.

1547
02:01:16,180 --> 02:01:22,180
While you're waiting for him to do this stuff, go to ragnarokonline.com and download that game.

1548
02:01:22,180 --> 02:01:26,180
You don't want to do it now because they'll interrupt their stream for Orange Lost Radio.

1549
02:01:26,180 --> 02:01:28,180
We already just heard like a ton of music.

1550
02:01:28,180 --> 02:01:30,180
Doesn't everybody have like a T1 connection? Come on.

1551
02:01:30,180 --> 02:01:34,180
We'll get to your music later, don't worry.

1552
02:01:34,180 --> 02:01:42,620

cheers to the third season thank you a drink drinks on the house as battle

1555
02:01:54,740 --> 02:01:56,900
Royale would say, one down, 13 to go.

1556
02:01:56,900 --> 02:01:58,980
I don't want any more freaking drinks.

1557
02:01:58,980 --> 02:02:00,580
All right.

1558
02:02:00,580 --> 02:02:06,780
So Maren, tell us about this book, this little manga

1559
02:02:06,780 --> 02:02:12,500
you're reading, the first volume of the English edition

1560
02:02:12,500 --> 02:02:14,340
of Battle Royale.

1561
02:02:14,340 --> 02:02:17,500
And Jamie handed it to me, so I am looking at it.

1562
02:02:17,500 --> 02:02:20,100
And hi, Smosh, because I know your name.

1563
02:02:20,100 --> 02:02:22,460
And the art is kind of interesting.

1564
02:02:22,460 --> 02:02:27,460
and there's a squirrel-faced guy in here that I really want to die, and hopefully he will

1565
02:02:27,460 --> 02:02:28,460
die soon.

1566
02:02:28,460 --> 02:02:29,460
That's about it.

1567
02:02:29,460 --> 02:02:32,460
Don't you think the battle royale thing is getting old?

1568
02:02:32,460 --> 02:02:35,460
Well, I had never seen battle royale until yesterday, so...

1569
02:02:35,460 --> 02:02:36,460
Oh, okay.

1570
02:02:36,460 --> 02:02:37,460
So it's still new for you.

1571
02:02:37,460 --> 02:02:38,460
I'm just teasing.

1572
02:02:38,460 --> 02:02:39,460
I'm just giving Jabin a hard time.

1573
02:02:39,460 --> 02:02:40,460
Oh, okay.

1574
02:02:40,460 --> 02:02:43,580
I get a long mic.

1575
02:02:43,580 --> 02:02:46,820
I'll come over here to the cuddling folks.

1576
02:02:46,820 --> 02:02:50,740
And since they wanted me to talk about marriage this episode and the people that are going

1577
02:02:50,740 --> 02:02:53,620
get married on this episode?

1578
02:02:53,620 --> 02:02:56,800
I'm just kidding.

1579
02:02:56,800 --> 02:03:01,920
Are you enjoying each other's company?

1580
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:04,700
Yea.

1581
02:03:04,700 --> 02:03:06,980
It's cute.

1582
02:03:06,980 --> 02:03:10,780
Speaking of which we did play those two in Scandia yesterday.

1583
02:03:10,780 --> 02:03:14,280
How much time did you guys collectively spend at Scandia this weekend?

1584
02:03:14,280 --> 02:03:18,280
Let's see, wait. Friday and Saturday.

1585
02:03:18,280 --> 02:03:22,280
So yeah, probably, you know.

1586
02:03:22,280 --> 02:03:26,280
Any annoying scandia people stories you want to tell?

1587
02:03:26,280 --> 02:03:30,280
Kids running across the DDR machine while you're trying to play.

1588
02:03:30,280 --> 02:03:34,280
On stage, I mean.

1589
02:03:34,280 --> 02:03:38,280
We have a picture of it. We had this three year old up on the extreme

1590
02:03:38,280 --> 02:03:42,280
just jumping around on stage

1591
02:03:42,280 --> 02:03:47,320
H2, Rhythm and Police, Light. It was hilarious. We have two pictures that will be up on the

1592
02:03:47,320 --> 02:03:48,320
album.

1593
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:55,320
You don't bring anything up, Rob.

1594
02:04:18,320 --> 02:04:19,940
set up

1595
02:04:19,940 --> 02:04:23,000
all i got to make a minute to keep me company this is nice anyway

1596
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:26,060
i want to talk about uh... this kind of like controversy at the three or

1597
02:04:26,060 --> 02:04:27,600
whatever you want to call it okay

1598
02:04:27,600 --> 02:04:30,600
eight folks terms i think it's a poster so from seattle came down which i think

1599
02:04:30,600 --> 02:04:33,600
is really cool like travel really far for a term in and i met

1600
02:04:33,600 --> 02:04:36,300
i met like one or two of them they were very nice and that uh...

1601
02:04:36,300 --> 02:04:37,760
this uh...

1602
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:38,720
girl goes by

1603
02:04:38,720 --> 02:04:41,600
d r four b online i think i hope it makes up the letters

1604
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:45,240
she's very cool really close to work at least things are shoes which is awesome

1605
02:04:45,240 --> 02:04:50,040
But Seattle was kind of getting, I guess, knocked or jabbed at or poked fun at or whatever

1606
02:04:50,040 --> 02:04:52,280
for being big old bar-rapers.

1607
02:04:52,280 --> 02:04:56,260
Like they hold onto the bar when they play their songs, which kind of creates a little

1608
02:04:56,260 --> 02:04:57,260
bit of controversy.

1609
02:04:57,260 --> 02:05:00,380
Is that real P.A. or whatever, you know, is it real?

1610
02:05:00,380 --> 02:05:04,880
And to them, looking at us, like, the way they're kind of looking at, or I should say,

1611
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:08,000
when I say us, I mean California, the way Seattle was kind of looking at California

1612
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:09,880
was kind of like, what's a big fucking deal?

1613
02:05:09,880 --> 02:05:10,880
You know?

1614
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:12,920
It's that the bars are there, so why not use them?

1615
02:05:12,920 --> 02:05:13,920
So what do you guys think?

1616
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:17,920
I'm curious of people's opinions in here on bar raping, quote-unquote.

1617
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:30,920
Um, I really don't give a shit, because I saw a guy AAA Max 300. Yes, he was raping the bar, but I'd like to see anybody else try that.

1618
02:05:30,920 --> 02:05:33,920
It doesn't really matter.

1619
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:44,920
Exactly, we do have a bleeder, okay? Anyway, I mean, think about it. He doesn't want to fall on his ass, he doesn't want to break his leg like, whatever that guy's name was.

1620
02:05:44,920 --> 02:05:50,920
So, at least he's not freestyling and holding onto the bar, that's different, but PA-ing, whatever you can do.

1621
02:05:50,920 --> 02:06:01,920
The only thing I didn't like, and it had nothing to do with bar raping, was the constant spraying down of Windex on the thing to rub down the pads to make sure they were absolutely clear and free of dust.

1622
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:35,920
Where, if I'm going to be putting all my weight in one foot, I won't fucking slip and die.

1623
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:39,920
If I'm playing singles, whatever, you know, whatever the pads are, fine.

1624
02:06:39,920 --> 02:06:51,920
I don't know if they realize or even notice, but if you wash them, if you use some sort of solution to clean the pads, it makes it slippier, slipperier, slipperier, slipper, whatever.

1625
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:58,920
ever

1626
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:25,160
Because if holding on to the bar will make me that much better, I'm going to do it.

1627
02:07:25,160 --> 02:07:28,080
I don't care if there's this stigma like, ooh, you're not supposed to hold on to the

1628
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:29,080
bar.

1629
02:07:29,080 --> 02:07:30,080
Fuck it.

1630
02:07:30,080 --> 02:07:31,680
If I can get scores that good, I'm going to hold on to the bar.

1631
02:07:31,680 --> 02:07:35,280
Sure enough, I go back, I play Legend of Max, I hold on to the bar this time, I got like

1632
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:39,560
15 seconds further than I usually do.

1633
02:07:39,560 --> 02:07:40,560
Go figure.

1634
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:44,880
Yes, thank you, my recent accomplishment.

1635
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:48,120
I am two-fisting the mics.

1636
02:07:48,120 --> 02:07:49,920
Why did you give me a mic and Rob gave me a mic?

1637
02:07:49,920 --> 02:07:51,920
Okay, I've got both mics.

1638
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:27,100
Okay, new topic, alright, we're gonna go with like, you know, this year and pretty much

1639
02:08:27,100 --> 02:08:28,100
last year.

1640
02:08:28,100 --> 02:08:33,480
This year I've noticed a lot of trends changing, you know, this is just like pop culture trends.

1641
02:08:33,480 --> 02:08:40,640
Example, you know, before I used to make all these AIDS jokes, like, you're gonna get AIDS.

1642
02:08:40,640 --> 02:08:46,360
SARS is the AIDS of 2003.

1643
02:08:46,360 --> 02:08:48,600
SARS is not a joke.

1644
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:54,340
We laughed so hard just over making SARS jokes during the whole trip.

1645
02:08:54,340 --> 02:08:57,460
It was great.

1646
02:08:57,460 --> 02:08:59,660
Is there any other pop culture changes you want to address?

1647
02:08:59,660 --> 02:09:02,300
There was another one, but I can't remember it right now.

1648
02:09:02,300 --> 02:09:03,980
When you think of it, you bring it up, okay?

1649
02:09:03,980 --> 02:09:04,980
Okay.

1650
02:09:04,980 --> 02:09:05,980
In the meantime, Janae, how's the story?

1651
02:09:05,980 --> 02:09:10,980
Okay, I have this really weird story to tell, because just thinking of SARS, it's just when

1652
02:09:10,980 --> 02:09:11,980
you think of something.

1653
02:09:11,980 --> 02:09:16,980
I went to the mall the other day and I went to the store, and as soon as I walked in the

1654
02:09:16,980 --> 02:09:20,800
coughing really bad I was like oh my god what's going on I thought it was like

1655
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:24,620
anthrax attack and walking through the store walking through everybody's

1656
02:09:24,620 --> 02:09:28,500

1657
02:09:28,500 --> 02:09:33,700

1659
02:09:37,700 --> 02:09:41,120
didn't know that the thing was full and he was messing around with it and it

1660
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:45,700
infected the whole store with pepper spray so that was really interesting to

Tell them your online name and give them a quick personal ad because we know you're available.

1669
02:10:29,700 --> 02:10:32,900
I don't know how true that is.

1670
02:10:32,900 --> 02:10:34,300
Okay, my name is Janae.

1671

On the board, I'm pixie dust and I'm 20.

1679
02:11:04,180 --> 02:11:04,600

What?

1685
02:11:13,740 --> 02:11:18,180
My friend was on TV because he was the only UC student to stay over in China during the

1686
02:11:18,180 --> 02:11:21,140
whole SARS thing while everyone else came home.

1687
02:11:21,140 --> 02:11:22,140
His name was Eric Fong.

1688
02:11:22,140 --> 02:11:27,860
If you're in the Sacramento area and you happened to be watching News 3 at 11 a couple days

1689
02:11:27,860 --> 02:11:29,420
ago, you probably saw him.

1690
02:11:29,420 --> 02:11:30,840
His name is Eric Fong.

1691
02:11:30,840 --> 02:11:33,740
He used to make fun of me all the time, but we were really good friends.

1692
02:11:33,740 --> 02:11:35,340
Aw, it's so precious.

1693
02:11:35,340 --> 02:11:38,860
Anyway, let's get to our Bemani mad lib.

1694

Give Jamie a mic.

1696
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:48,660
Basically, I'm going to tell you whether or not to say a verb, noun, adjective, whatever.

1697
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:52,360
Okay. And you suggest it and you go around the room, everyone's suggesting one.

02:11:52,680 --> 02:11:57,020
Okay. One by one and then we'll read you the story and, by the way, this particular one,

1699
02:11:57,440 --> 02:12:00,640
I might even give you the title or anything of what it is, but you get to find

1700
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:03,640
out what it is you're butchering after you put in the words.

1701
02:12:03,640 --> 02:12:06,420
So should they be Bhumani related words?

1702
02:12:06,420 --> 02:12:07,680
No, not necessarily.

1703
02:12:07,680 --> 02:12:09,520
Okay. Be creative.

1704
02:12:09,520 --> 02:12:13,720
Be creative. Okay. But I'm not even going to say that much. Here you go.

1898
02:22:07,260 --> 02:22:12,380
there are a few million people out there who assfuck the many Black Rapinoe versions of

1899
02:22:12,380 --> 02:22:16,780
a poll to back me up.

02:22:16,780 --> 02:22:22,800
Many frozen extra cream cheese are crapfully included to combust the basic gameplay concept.

1901
02:22:22,800 --> 02:22:32,920

1902
02:22:32,920 --> 02:22:39,780
free play, and the diet shit, where the other extras, oh, where the game shit the calories

1903
02:22:39,780 --> 02:22:48,600
you burn by burninating, but not the solo mode and the other extras that arrowed with

1904
02:22:48,600 --> 02:22:58,820
recently released number mix, released 4900 mix, whatever, okay, there's no cosplaying

1905
02:22:58,820 --> 02:23:05,140
that I can sodomize though, no homosexual chainsaw like the sexual centipede and such.

1906
02:23:05,140 --> 02:23:10,940
So, and how was that for our first big year of Mad Lib?

1907
02:23:10,940 --> 02:23:11,940
Beautiful.

1908
02:23:11,940 --> 02:23:12,940
I think, you know what?

1909
02:23:12,940 --> 02:23:16,140
I think the chat room fell asleep for the first half of that, but that was a good payoff

1910
02:23:16,140 --> 02:23:20,740
at the end, so it was worth it that you burninated.

1911
02:23:20,740 --> 02:23:24,180
Maybe we should, maybe we should like make one in advance and have the chat room vote

1912
02:23:24,180 --> 02:23:30,660
on words or send them by email and then we put it in to read during the show later.

1913
02:23:30,660 --> 02:23:32,300
We'll tweak that one.

1914
02:23:32,300 --> 02:23:34,540
Well, that was fun.

1915
02:23:34,540 --> 02:23:36,860
Yeah, I like that.

1916
02:23:36,860 --> 02:23:39,260
Shit the calories you've burned by burninating.

1917
02:23:39,260 --> 02:23:41,260
Oh, boy.

1918
02:23:41,260 --> 02:23:50,820
Hey, Irene, the chat room wants to see another Orange Crush segment.

1919
02:23:50,820 --> 02:23:53,260
When do we get to see one of those?

1920
02:23:53,260 --> 02:23:55,980
I could probably come up with one by the end of the night.

1921
02:23:55,980 --> 02:23:56,980
By the end of the night tonight?

1922
02:23:56,980 --> 02:23:58,340

You got 30 minutes?

1924
02:23:59,820 --> 02:24:02,100
Okay, I could probably get it in like 10 minutes.

1925
02:24:02,100 --> 02:24:05,080
Okay, what we'll do, we're going to go to a quick break and then we'll come back and

1926
02:24:05,080 --> 02:24:06,740

1927
02:24:06,740 --> 02:24:07,740
Yeah, that's fine.

1928
02:24:07,740 --> 02:24:08,740
Does that sound fine?

1929
02:24:08,740 --> 02:24:09,740
Okay.

1930
02:24:09,740 --> 02:24:10,740

1953
02:33:11,600 --> 02:33:18,600
Hello? Hello, is this thing on testing? Testing 1-2?

1954
02:33:18,600 --> 02:33:24,600
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

1955
02:33:24,600 --> 02:33:28,600
Hello? I don't understand this. Does this thing work?

1956
02:33:28,600 --> 02:33:29,600
This thing reads like stereo instructions!

1957
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:30,600
Is this on?

1958
02:33:30,600 --> 02:33:31,600
What the hell?

1959
02:33:31,600 --> 02:33:37,600
Orange Lounge Radio broke down Get Open Monty Radio.

1960
02:33:37,600 --> 02:33:39,600
What the f***?

1961
02:33:39,600 --> 02:33:44,600
Welcome back, everybody. It's time for everybody's favorite part of Orange Lounge.

1962
02:33:44,600 --> 02:33:49,600
It's the part where the chat room really gets to participate. It's Ask Orange Lounge!

1963
02:33:49,600 --> 02:33:53,600
Tonight you can ask Orange Lounge, that would be myself, DarkSakura, or Loki.

1964
02:33:53,600 --> 02:33:57,600
Or you could ask Maren. You could ask Pixie Dust. You could ask...

1965
02:33:57,600 --> 02:34:00,600
Well, Nelly's probably not going to talk to you, but you could try asking her.

1966
02:34:00,600 --> 02:34:07,600
You could ask Brad, Irene. You could ask Navi, but he probably won't talk to you either because he's setting up for Orange Crush.

1967
02:34:07,600 --> 02:34:09,460
Or you could ask DDR Angel and Magus.

1968
02:34:09,460 --> 02:34:11,900
Quite the cute couple over there.

1969
02:34:11,900 --> 02:34:16,420
All right, let's get to the first question, shall we?

1970
02:34:16,420 --> 02:34:20,660
Let's ask your ass, how are you feeling today?

1971
02:34:20,660 --> 02:34:23,560
That had a maturity level of like three.

1972
02:34:23,560 --> 02:34:27,280
All right, first question from DJ Tyrant

1973
02:34:27,280 --> 02:34:30,100
wants to know, when can I come up and be a guest on the show?

1974
02:34:30,100 --> 02:34:31,100
That's my question.

1975
02:34:31,100 --> 02:34:33,900
Well, when can you get in your car and drive?

1976
02:34:33,900 --> 02:34:36,100
Plus, you know, I don't know.

1977
02:34:36,100 --> 02:34:43,100
I feel weird about having strangers in the house. I mean, of course, it worked before because I didn't know Angel before she came up here to be on the show, so...

1978
02:34:43,100 --> 02:34:49,100
Tyrant's not the only one that said he wants to be on the show, though. Here's my recommendation to you. Come to a tournament...

1979
02:34:49,100 --> 02:34:55,100
Come to a tournament like, you know, we'll be... I'm sure at least one of the three of us will be at Cyber Beat Nation 2.

1980
02:34:55,100 --> 02:34:59,100
Or come, you know, come to us at a tournament, get to know us there, come be on a team...

1981
02:34:59,100 --> 02:35:00,100
Or just come.

1982
02:35:00,100 --> 02:35:01,100
Or just come.

1983
02:35:01,100 --> 02:35:05,100
And then, once we get to know you, okay, come on a show.

1984
02:35:05,100 --> 02:35:12,100
Because I can't come to the studio.

1985
02:35:12,100 --> 02:35:15,020
Come to a tournament and get warmed up to the show first, because that's an easy way

1986
02:35:15,020 --> 02:35:16,020
to be on the show.

1987
02:35:16,020 --> 02:35:21,060
You don't have to sit here and be bored in the studio like everyone else.

1988
02:35:21,060 --> 02:35:23,180
Let's get to the next question from Ninst.

1989
02:35:23,180 --> 02:35:27,700
Ninst would like to know, what is the meaning of life, the universe and everything?

1990
02:35:27,700 --> 02:35:28,700
42.

1991
02:35:28,700 --> 02:35:31,820
42 says Mary, 42 says Jamie.

1992
02:35:31,820 --> 02:35:33,540
69 says Skye.

1993
02:35:33,540 --> 02:35:34,540
37.

1994
02:35:34,540 --> 02:35:38,940
Janae might have a serious answer.

1995
02:35:38,940 --> 02:35:45,780
My ass. Your ass. That's wonderful. That's the second person.

1996
02:35:45,780 --> 02:35:50,260
The meaning of life really is 42. The earth was constructed to solve the riddle of the

1997
02:35:50,260 --> 02:35:51,260
meaning of life.

1998
02:35:51,260 --> 02:35:55,300
Unfortunately, it was destroyed before it could finish the computations, so it came up with 42.

1999
02:35:55,300 --> 02:35:58,760
Now the purpose of life is easy.

2000
02:35:58,760 --> 02:36:03,580
The purpose of life is not dying. The purpose of life,

2001
02:36:03,580 --> 02:36:07,180
Breathe in, breathe out. Repeat.

2002
02:36:07,180 --> 02:36:10,660
I have a serious answer to this question. Can you people handle it?

2003
02:36:10,660 --> 02:36:12,340
No.

2004
02:36:12,340 --> 02:36:15,420
Okay, I'm going to try a serious answer to this question.

2005
02:36:15,420 --> 02:36:17,500
The meaning of life

2006
02:36:17,500 --> 02:36:21,300
is to experience every possible emotion possible.

2007
02:36:21,300 --> 02:36:23,020
Aw, da da da.

2008
02:36:23,020 --> 02:36:28,620
That's not an aw, that's like, death can be one of those. I still think the answer is 42.

2009
02:36:28,620 --> 02:36:30,420
It's 42.

2010
02:36:30,420 --> 02:36:34,420
I feel deathly ill. I woke up the other day and I went, ah, I'm deathly ill.

2011
02:36:34,420 --> 02:36:39,420
Alright. That's, that's funny. You know what's funny?

2012
02:36:39,420 --> 02:36:41,420
I'm experiencing vomit from that.

2013
02:36:41,420 --> 02:36:47,420
You know what the meaning of life is? Well, actually, you'll never know because once you figure out the meaning of life, that's when you die.

2014
02:36:47,420 --> 02:36:53,420
See, so if you ever do figure out the meaning of life, you will die. That's why no one has ever figured it out.

2015
02:36:53,420 --> 02:36:54,420
The meaning of-

2016
02:36:54,420 --> 02:36:55,420
Hey, Shady.

2017
02:36:55,420 --> 02:36:57,420
Ah, shit. Dead.

2018
02:36:57,420 --> 02:36:59,420
Alright. Second-

2019
02:37:29,420 --> 02:37:32,620
Wait, what do you do? You just kind of like straddle the dryer?

2020
02:37:32,620 --> 02:37:35,620
Exactly. It's an industrial one, so I straddle the dryer.

2021
02:37:35,620 --> 02:37:38,920
It's Talbe? Does he know?

2022
02:37:38,920 --> 02:37:42,020
That's awful. I hope you get beat for that.

2023
02:37:42,020 --> 02:37:43,820
Alright, moving on.

2024
02:37:43,820 --> 02:37:46,920
Next question from John Fields.

2025
02:37:46,920 --> 02:37:50,320
Just how many people in California have SARS?

2026
02:37:50,320 --> 02:37:53,720
I want to be on the show when I visit California, but if SARS is a problem,

2027
02:37:53,720 --> 02:37:56,620
I may wait for next summer to visit.

2028
02:37:56,620 --> 02:38:00,120
That's gotta be the dumbest question I've ever heard.

2029
02:38:00,120 --> 02:38:04,880
Why is that? Because anyone who's been in America who's gotten SARS

2030
02:38:04,880 --> 02:38:07,820
has gotten treatment for it and are like, better.

2031
02:38:07,820 --> 02:38:10,660
I think it was a joke.

2032
02:38:10,660 --> 02:38:14,540
Just, you know what, we're not Toronto, so get over it.

2033
02:38:14,540 --> 02:38:18,300
Yeah, Toronto's just trying to be special because they're Canadian.

2034
02:38:18,300 --> 02:38:22,180
You know, and they're just like, look at us, we're Chinese.

2035
02:38:22,180 --> 02:38:23,420
Sort of.

2036
02:38:23,420 --> 02:38:25,260
We have SARS.

2037
02:38:25,260 --> 02:38:27,400
for sarsi

2038
02:38:27,400 --> 02:38:29,760
we got stars a alright

2039
02:38:29,760 --> 02:38:31,000
moving on

2040
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:34,940
black lab all excellent excellent question from black lab referring to the

2041
02:38:34,940 --> 02:38:36,740
chat room earlier this week

2042
02:38:36,740 --> 02:38:39,920
okay we have to get an answer from everybody on this

2043
02:38:39,920 --> 02:38:44,900
have you ever been that point where you were just so hungry you are so deathly

2044
02:38:44,900 --> 02:38:49,320
hungry you would just do anything the question from black lab would you give a

2045
02:38:49,320 --> 02:38:51,200
blow job for a pizza

2046
02:38:51,200 --> 02:38:54,860
and i've done that

2047
02:38:54,860 --> 02:38:56,920
notice i don't have to

2048
02:38:56,920 --> 02:39:01,260
i wouldn't give a blowjob for any reason because it's nasty

2049
02:39:01,260 --> 02:39:04,580
i'm sorry but it's the whole concept of putting your mouth where someone pisses

2050
02:39:04,580 --> 02:39:06,220
from uh...

2051
02:39:06,220 --> 02:39:09,540
so i would probably say that what i would do instead is get in my car and go

2052
02:39:09,540 --> 02:39:11,500
buy one

2053
02:39:11,500 --> 02:39:14,780
let's say you don't have any money

2054
02:39:14,780 --> 02:39:19,540
then i would kill someone for pizza but i would never blow them

2055
02:39:19,540 --> 02:39:21,500
uh... anybody else want to comment

2056
02:39:21,500 --> 02:39:24,520
i agree with jamie thank you

2057
02:39:24,520 --> 02:39:28,520
Well, I'd receive one for pizza, then I'd have a blowjob for pizza.

2058
02:39:28,520 --> 02:39:30,520
Excuse me?

2059
02:39:30,520 --> 02:39:33,520
Here's an excellent plug for our forums right here.

2060
02:39:33,520 --> 02:39:38,520
Visit www.calibomani.com slash nbor3 where our forums are.

2061
02:39:38,520 --> 02:39:43,520
And Zero put an excellent answer to this question earlier this week, so go read it.

2062
02:39:43,520 --> 02:39:49,520
Let's change this show from Orange Lounge to Dick Haters, because...

2063
02:39:49,520 --> 02:39:51,520
I don't hate...

2064
02:39:51,520 --> 02:39:53,620
uh... uh... we can't

2065
02:39:53,620 --> 02:39:55,600
dictating feminized

2066
02:39:55,600 --> 02:39:57,660
hey really really really

2067
02:39:57,660 --> 02:39:59,540

2068
02:39:59,540 --> 02:40:02,340
it's not that i hate dick

2069
02:40:02,340 --> 02:40:05,280
it's like i don't think it's particularly appetite let me please let

2070
02:40:05,280 --> 02:40:07,420

2071
02:40:07,420 --> 02:40:11,260
to jamie dick is like a teddy bear you know you can fluff it and play with it

2072
02:40:11,260 --> 02:40:12,540
and how to get squeezed it

2073
02:40:12,540 --> 02:40:14,620
you're not gonna eat it

2074
02:40:14,620 --> 02:40:18,240
you put it in your your couch

2075
02:40:18,240 --> 02:40:25,120
me dick is foreign it is so foreign it's like japan so i don't know where it is it's so foreign

2076
02:40:25,120 --> 02:40:29,440
let's revise this let's revise this what would you do for kondike bar

2077
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:35,120
but that's chocolate that's different anyway moving on what would you do for oreo kondike

2078
02:40:35,120 --> 02:40:39,440
bar moving on i want to get through i want to get through these ask horse lounge questions

2079
02:40:39,440 --> 02:40:46,960
okay here we go here we go i just heard oh this is from crash override 003 as opposed to 0070s 003

2080
02:40:46,960 --> 02:40:53,960
I just heard that DDR Extreme is the last arcade game for the DDR series, oh that old

2081
02:40:54,240 --> 02:41:01,240
rumor. Is this true? If it is, the last will be complete BS.

2082
02:41:02,200 --> 02:41:05,880
Again, that old rumor.

2083
02:41:05,880 --> 02:41:08,960
You know what, this is my thought, again, there is no definitive answer. If we knew

2084
02:41:08,960 --> 02:41:12,020
the definitive answer, we'd tell you.

2085
02:41:12,020 --> 02:41:14,480
I have the definitive answer.

2086
02:41:14,480 --> 02:41:15,480
Who gives a shit?

2087
02:41:15,480 --> 02:41:16,480
This DDR sucks.

2088
02:41:16,480 --> 02:41:17,480
Shut up.

2089
02:41:17,480 --> 02:41:22,180
No, it's not the last one, the next one will be the last one, and they're going to continue

2090
02:41:22,180 --> 02:41:27,360
it on the console because DDR is not popular in Japan, popular music is.

2091
02:41:27,360 --> 02:41:28,520
Here's my thought on it.

2092
02:41:28,520 --> 02:41:30,720
As far as the USA is concerned, it's true.

2093
02:41:30,720 --> 02:41:33,240
There's probably not going to be any other USA machines.

2094
02:41:33,240 --> 02:41:35,120
It's pretty much a home only thing.

2095
02:41:35,120 --> 02:41:38,340
Japan, nobody really knows, but here's my thought.

2096
02:41:38,340 --> 02:41:41,880
It's probably the last version of DDR in its current form.

2097
02:41:41,880 --> 02:41:46,860
If they do another DDR, it's going to be like DDR or DX type thing.

2098
02:41:46,860 --> 02:41:48,860
That's my honest opinion on it.

2099
02:41:48,860 --> 02:41:51,340
So we can take no motion, I see.

2100
02:41:51,340 --> 02:41:52,340
Hopefully.

2101
02:41:52,340 --> 02:41:53,340
Not.

2102
02:41:53,340 --> 02:41:57,420
Anyway, let's see, also second part of this question, oh!

2103
02:41:57,420 --> 02:41:59,820
And when are they going to fire Naoki and replace him?

2104
02:41:59,820 --> 02:42:02,180
Some of his material is just plain shit now these days.

2105
02:42:02,180 --> 02:42:08,380
Don't you know that they clone Naoki every year and keep using his clones?

2106
02:42:08,380 --> 02:42:09,600
I don't know.

2107
02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:14,740
I do notice that Xtreme kind of had less Naoki tracks than usual, but I don't think.

2108
02:42:14,740 --> 02:42:17,380
He's still doing music for 2DX and all that, so he's still around.

2109
02:42:17,380 --> 02:42:21,540
From what I understand, isn't he also actually working on Gradius 5?

2110
02:42:21,540 --> 02:42:24,300
Yeah, he's got things to do.

2111
02:42:24,300 --> 02:42:25,540
Alright.

2112
02:42:25,540 --> 02:42:30,300
Okay, so I'm going to cut off the question submission now, so I've got four questions

2113
02:42:30,300 --> 02:43:00,020
left to burn through here and then we're going to get to Orange Crush.

2114
02:43:00,020 --> 02:43:07,020
would like to know what would Jesus do for a Klondike bar?

2115
02:43:07,380 --> 02:43:14,380
What would Jesus do for a Klondike bar?

2116
02:43:14,380 --> 02:43:17,380
He'd just, you know, hang around.

2117
02:43:17,380 --> 02:43:24,380
He'd pick up a piece of shit and turn it into a Klondike bar.

2118
02:43:24,380 --> 02:43:28,380
Jesus would blow the pizza man.

2119
02:43:28,380 --> 02:43:30,380
Anyway, okay.

2120
02:43:30,380 --> 02:43:35,380
Last question. Are you guys ready for Orange Crush? Good. Okay.

2121
02:43:35,380 --> 02:43:40,380
Puppy would like to know, do any of you, oh, and I know Jamie knows the answer to this, I'm almost positive.

2122
02:43:40,380 --> 02:43:45,380
Black Lab wants to know, do any of you know where the saying, this DDR sucks, came from?

2123
02:43:45,380 --> 02:43:50,380
It came from Fuzzy Half, from Drakona Staunter.

2124
02:43:50,380 --> 02:43:55,380
She was at a DDR tournament and said, this DDR sucks.

2125
02:43:55,380 --> 02:43:56,380
So there you go.

2126
02:43:56,380 --> 02:43:57,380
Was that at CVGL or was that at-

2127
02:43:57,380 --> 02:43:58,380
It was Lily.

2128
02:43:58,380 --> 02:44:01,380
I know it was Lily that said it, but was that CVGL or was that at the Mountain Mikes one?

2129
02:44:01,380 --> 02:44:02,380
Mountain Mikes.

2130
02:44:02,380 --> 02:44:03,380
I think it was the Mountain Mikes one.

2131
02:44:03,380 --> 02:44:06,380
I thought it was from, what was it, that huge-

2132
02:44:06,380 --> 02:44:07,380
No, it was CVGL.

2133
02:44:07,380 --> 02:44:17,380
I thought it was that huge SoCal tournament or whatever that they were competing for freestyle or whatever and it was for the solo machine.

2134
02:44:17,380 --> 02:44:19,380
That solo sucks anyway.

2135
02:44:19,380 --> 02:44:20,380
That's the other one.

2136
02:44:20,380 --> 02:44:22,380
But yeah, this DDR sucks.

2137
02:44:22,380 --> 02:44:26,380
It was TVGL because we did the Step Squad thing at Mount Likes.

2138
02:44:26,380 --> 02:44:28,380
The promo at Mount Likes.

2139
02:44:28,380 --> 02:44:29,380
Oh okay.

2140
02:44:29,380 --> 02:44:30,380
She didn't go, I went.

2141
02:44:30,380 --> 02:44:33,380
I thought it was the same day that you guys had done that promo, but it was TVGL.

2142
02:44:33,380 --> 02:44:34,380
No, it was before.

2143
02:44:34,380 --> 02:44:36,380
We tried to get her to say it again and she wouldn't.

2144
02:45:06,380 --> 02:45:15,380
Now, it's time for Orange Crush. Now, it's time for Orange Crush.

2145
02:45:15,380 --> 02:45:28,380
Okay, Irene, take it away. Do I need to leave the room then first? Tell them about the topic and stuff, and somebody else needs to time.

2146
02:45:28,380 --> 02:45:52,920
The theme for tonight is called Five Button Mode.

2147
02:45:52,920 --> 02:45:58,280

Yes, I've been glad one right how many did Jamie get a half of one?

2200
02:48:33,980 --> 02:48:35,980
I'd be Jamie. I'd be

2201
02:48:38,380 --> 02:48:40,780
Jamie since you're sitting right there. Okay. What's the fifth question?

2202
02:48:40,780 --> 02:48:46,460
I just want to get a question that neither of you got to was the vocalist from Sweden from the Swedish song did which song?

2203
02:48:46,460 --> 02:48:48,300
in eighth style

2204
02:48:48,300 --> 02:48:50,300
our shadow

2205
02:48:50,300 --> 02:49:05,580
Which song from Guitar Freaks 9 and Drum Mini 8 came from Poppin' Music 8?

2206
02:49:05,580 --> 02:49:06,580
Rob is right.

2207
02:49:06,580 --> 02:49:07,580
777.

2208
02:49:07,580 --> 02:49:08,580
You know how I knew that?

2209
02:49:08,580 --> 02:49:11,700
Because that's in rotation on Orange Line right now.

2210
02:49:11,700 --> 02:49:12,700
Question number two.

2211
02:49:12,700 --> 02:49:15,140
Which Poppin' Music artist is getting the newest artist collection CD?

2212
02:49:15,140 --> 02:49:16,560
Let me think about this one a little longer.

2213
02:49:16,560 --> 02:49:21,440
The pop and music artist getting a collection CD?

2214
02:49:21,440 --> 02:49:25,240
I'm just trying to think of the artist to have a lot of songs in pop and music.

2215
02:49:25,240 --> 02:49:27,240
I would...

2216
02:49:27,240 --> 02:49:28,240
The classic?

2217
02:49:28,240 --> 02:49:29,240
The classical ones?

2218
02:49:29,240 --> 02:49:36,000
It's either going to be A. Desrow, B. Hideo Suwa, or C. Parquettes?

2219
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,920
I would actually say before I say Desrow, I would say Hideo Suwa.

2220
02:49:38,920 --> 02:49:39,920
No it's Parquettes.

2221
02:49:39,920 --> 02:49:40,920
No.

2222
02:49:40,920 --> 02:49:41,920
Haha.

2223
02:49:41,920 --> 02:49:42,920
Okay third...

2224
02:49:42,920 --> 02:49:52,480
3. In PAPA MUSIC 7, the song PLUTONIC LOVE is done by NARD, who is better known by which

2225
02:49:52,480 --> 02:49:53,480
alias?

2226
02:49:53,480 --> 02:50:09,240
4. What are the names of the two star characters in PAPA MUSIC, NIAMI and NIMI?

2227
02:50:09,240 --> 02:50:13,060
I was thinking of the other ones, I was trying to think of that chick from Dimanche that

2228
02:50:13,060 --> 02:50:18,240
looks like a hussy in the second one, yeah I know you, I know, and then I had the image

2229
02:50:18,240 --> 02:50:20,880
of them, oh that's what they're talking about and I had no idea.

2230
02:50:20,880 --> 02:50:24,600
Okay and the fifth question, the vocalist from the Swedish song did which song in 8th

2231
02:50:24,600 --> 02:50:25,600
style?

2232
02:50:25,600 --> 02:50:26,600
Murmur Twins.

2233
02:50:26,600 --> 02:50:30,480
Oh, I should have known because it's like Garrett's favorite 8th style song, or one

2234
02:50:30,480 --> 02:50:31,480
of them.

2235
02:50:31,480 --> 02:50:33,480
One of them, isn't it?

2236
02:50:33,480 --> 02:50:39,080
I love Murmur Twins.

2237
02:50:39,080 --> 02:50:41,920
And that concludes another episode of Orange Crush.

2238
02:50:41,920 --> 02:50:42,920
Thank you very much.

2239
02:50:42,920 --> 02:50:43,920
That was beautiful.

2240
02:50:43,920 --> 02:50:44,920
You're welcome.

2241
02:50:44,920 --> 02:50:45,920
Here you go.

2242
02:50:45,920 --> 02:50:46,920
Good job.

2243
02:50:46,920 --> 02:50:47,920
I hope the chowram enjoyed that.

2244
02:50:47,920 --> 02:50:48,920
Yeah.

2245
02:50:48,920 --> 02:50:49,920
Jamie and I making butts.

2246
02:50:49,920 --> 02:50:51,920
Jamie and I making butts out of ourselves with our lack of pop and music knowledge.

2247
02:50:51,920 --> 02:50:53,760
Because he made the questions.

2248
02:50:53,760 --> 02:50:54,760
I got yummy.

2249
02:50:54,760 --> 02:50:59,440
I like to give mad props to Garrett for his accomplishments.

2250
02:50:59,440 --> 02:51:02,080
You know, I got it because he was in YY Racing and he was like, hey.

2251
02:51:02,080 --> 02:51:03,720
I am so down with Garrett.

2252
02:51:03,720 --> 02:51:06,420
The only reason I knew like any of those or would have known it.

2253
02:51:06,420 --> 02:51:13,420
You know, I'm such good friends with Garrett, and I still didn't know.

2254
02:51:13,420 --> 02:51:22,360
Okay, so, can I get my chair back, please, please, alright.

2255
02:51:22,360 --> 02:51:23,940
What else do you guys want to talk about?

2256
02:51:23,940 --> 02:51:26,740
Do you want to say something about popin' music, because we never talk about popin'

2257
02:51:26,740 --> 02:51:27,740
music in the show.

2258
02:51:27,740 --> 02:51:28,740
You want to say something about it?

2259
02:51:28,740 --> 02:51:30,740
Want to say it, Navi?

2260
02:51:30,740 --> 02:51:34,620
Alright, I'll say something about popin' music.

2261
02:51:34,620 --> 02:51:39,240
It's apparently no one ever really plays it except for like me and then people in SoCal.

2262
02:51:39,240 --> 02:51:41,100
As demonstrated by that last quiz.

2263
02:51:41,100 --> 02:51:42,100
Yeah.

2264
02:51:42,100 --> 02:51:43,100
News.

2265
02:51:43,100 --> 02:51:48,860
Pop and Music 8 is coming out on July 3rd at home along with Silent Hill 3 is being

2266
02:51:48,860 --> 02:51:52,380
released on the same date.

2267
02:51:52,380 --> 02:51:56,780
The wonderful site Nifty slash Global Gate where you can translate all those fun Japanese

2268
02:51:56,780 --> 02:52:01,940
pages into English clearly demonstrated how confusing their sites are.

2269
02:52:01,940 --> 02:52:06,920
It's either that or the Japanese are weird with the way that they, I don't know.

2270
02:52:06,920 --> 02:52:10,920
In my Japanese class I learned all kinds of stuff about their culture and how, you know,

2271
02:52:10,920 --> 02:52:14,920
like an example, you don't say you don't want something, you just say, oh, I'll take a little

2272
02:52:14,920 --> 02:52:20,080
of it and that means you don't want it because it's too rude to say you don't want it.

2273
02:52:20,080 --> 02:52:26,200
Same kind of goes for when I was trying to translate these pages and read about the pre-orders

2274
02:52:26,200 --> 02:52:30,440
for the limited edition pop and music stuff, see what the hell they're all putting in it.

2275
02:52:30,440 --> 02:52:36,020
It looks like, from the way everything is worded and separated, they have the limited

2276
02:52:36,020 --> 02:52:42,560
edition package and then they have the privileged limited edition package, which I don't really

2277
02:52:42,560 --> 02:52:46,760
get what the hell is going on, but needless to say, they're loading this shit up.

2278
02:52:46,760 --> 02:52:51,800
I don't know why they don't do this for any other Bimani games, but Pop'n Music 7 had

2279
02:52:51,800 --> 02:52:53,120
tons and tons of stuff in it.

2280
02:52:53,120 --> 02:52:55,200
This one has just as much.

2281
02:52:55,200 --> 02:52:58,680
They're putting in long, besides the V-Rare CD.

2282
02:52:58,680 --> 02:53:05,980
They have a new sticker pack with all kinds of stickers of characters and stuff.

2283
02:53:05,980 --> 02:53:07,160
I didn't really read what it was.

2284
02:53:07,160 --> 02:53:13,380
I think it's actually a stuffed character from the fresh genre song from Papa Music

2285
02:53:13,380 --> 02:53:14,380
8.

2286
02:53:14,380 --> 02:53:18,300
It looks like this little cat thing with an owl nose or something.

2287
02:53:18,300 --> 02:53:20,300
I don't know.

2288
02:53:20,300 --> 02:53:27,220
There's going to be a big canvas tote bag that's all Papa Music-ified.

2289
02:53:27,220 --> 02:53:31,480
Japanese fan that's supposed to be designed from one of the ones that one

2290
02:53:31,480 --> 02:53:37,620
of the characters was holding in Popin' Music 8. There was some more stuff too I

2291
02:53:37,620 --> 02:53:43,740
can't remember it all but it's one big humongous package of goodies and there's

2292
02:53:43,740 --> 02:53:49,580
going to be well over a hundred songs in Popin' Music 8. There were 54 new songs

2293
02:53:49,580 --> 02:53:53,980
to begin with in 8 and usually with how they do the consumer stuff there'll

2294
02:53:53,980 --> 02:53:59,580
be another 10 to 15 consumer tracks that they add on to this. So it's going to be quite

2295
02:53:59,580 --> 02:54:05,160
a nice game. Yeah, I don't know what else to say.

2296
02:54:05,160 --> 02:54:06,420
I'm moist of anticipation.

2297
02:54:06,420 --> 02:54:10,740
That was so funny. One big humongous package of goodies.

2298
02:54:10,740 --> 02:54:14,620
Yeah, Pop Music 10 is being test located right now in Japan also.

2299
02:54:14,620 --> 02:54:17,060
I came up with a stupid thing that you could use.

2300
02:54:17,060 --> 02:54:18,740
What?

2301
02:54:18,740 --> 02:54:22,420
Now introducing Orange Lounge with a fresher scent.

2302
02:54:22,420 --> 02:54:23,420
Thank you. That's very clever.

2303
02:54:23,420 --> 02:54:35,100
Thank you very much for the pop music update, we appreciate that.

2304
02:54:35,100 --> 02:54:38,100
We'll have to bring you back to do it again, because none of us keep tabs on pop music.

2305
02:54:38,100 --> 02:54:40,860
The only person in the whole North State I think that plays it regularly.

2306
02:54:40,860 --> 02:54:44,060
Oh yeah, and then I'll really get to play it once I get my arcade style controller so

2307
02:54:44,060 --> 02:54:48,420
I can tell you how wonderful that is and then you guys can be jealous.

2308
02:54:48,420 --> 02:54:49,980
I'll get to play it, you better let me play it.

2309
02:54:49,980 --> 02:54:52,420
You have to bring it to an episode and then we'll just have an episode of Orange Lounge

2310
02:55:22,420 --> 02:55:27,420
And it's got, like, a bunch of bug fixes and stuff, so we're good to go and download that. It's pretty cool.

2311
02:55:27,420 --> 02:55:32,420
And, um, other than that, I don't think there's really anything going on.

2312
02:55:34,420 --> 02:55:35,420
Yep.

2313
02:55:35,420 --> 02:55:36,420
Oh.

2314
02:55:36,420 --> 02:55:37,420
Okay.

2315
02:55:37,420 --> 02:55:42,420
Okay, since we have such a long-ass fortune cookie message today, thanks to Jamie,

2316
02:55:42,420 --> 02:55:47,420
I'm gonna go around and collect everyone's final thought. It's that time, it's that time of the show, you guys. End of show.

2317
02:55:47,420 --> 02:55:50,420
So I guess since Irene's got the mic, we'll start with her. No? We're gonna start with Garrett?

2318
02:55:50,420 --> 02:55:51,420
No.

2319
02:55:51,420 --> 02:55:53,220
Care doesn't have a final thought.

2320
02:55:53,220 --> 02:55:54,340
No final thought.

2321
02:55:54,340 --> 02:55:57,940
Nellie have a final thought?

2322
02:55:57,940 --> 02:56:01,180
This show fucking sucks, says Nellie. Thank you, we agree.

2323
02:56:01,180 --> 02:56:03,260
Uh, Irene.

2324
02:56:03,260 --> 02:56:07,240
Brad, final thought.

2325
02:56:07,240 --> 02:56:12,140
Go to ragnarchonline.com and download the game.

2326
02:56:12,140 --> 02:56:12,980
That is all.

2327
02:56:12,980 --> 02:56:15,480
Play on Loki, that's where I am.

2328
02:56:15,480 --> 02:56:17,380
Play on Loki.

2329
02:56:17,380 --> 02:56:20,420
Play on KF Loki.

2330
02:56:20,420 --> 02:56:25,720
we all just get a life. I don't think Loki would appreciate you while playing on him.

2331
02:56:25,720 --> 02:56:32,720
Final thought, Irene? Garret's great. He did my hair and it looks so awesome. Yeah. Okay,

2332
02:56:32,720 --> 02:56:39,720
fine. Final thought, Pixie Dust? I just want to meet a cute boy. I'm right here. What happened?

2333
02:56:39,720 --> 02:56:49,720
I said a cute boy, not a Buddha boy. I am so offended. Get out of my house. Nigga, please.

2334
02:56:49,720 --> 02:56:56,080
she's it she is part black she can say that word

2335
02:56:56,080 --> 02:56:58,720
that's why i can say bad because i'm gay

2336
02:56:58,720 --> 02:57:00,360
angel

2337
02:57:00,360 --> 02:57:02,160

2338
02:57:02,160 --> 02:57:06,260

2339
02:57:06,260 --> 02:57:09,280

2340
02:57:09,280 --> 02:57:11,920

2341
02:57:11,920 --> 02:57:14,160
okay i don't know

2342
02:57:14,160 --> 02:57:16,840
nagas final thought

2343
02:57:16,840 --> 02:57:19,840
Well, haha, I'm still better than the Clippers, bitch.

2344
02:57:22,840 --> 02:57:24,840
Anyway...

2345
02:57:25,840 --> 02:57:28,840
Maren! Final thought.

2346
02:57:29,840 --> 02:57:33,840
Aw, she doesn't have a final thought. Thank you for coming, Maren. Everybody give Maren a hand.

2347
02:57:34,840 --> 02:57:38,840
Maren's great. So many new faces on tonight's show. It's nice. It's refreshing.

2348
02:57:38,840 --> 02:57:39,840
They can't see any of them.

2349
02:57:39,840 --> 02:57:42,840
Yeah, you can't see any of them because we were too lazy to set the webcam.

2350
02:57:42,840 --> 02:57:45,840
You want me to go to Loki for final thought here? Okay.

2351
02:57:45,840 --> 02:57:48,880
Richie, I love you.

2352
02:57:48,880 --> 02:57:51,760
Loki, final thought.

2353
02:57:51,760 --> 02:57:55,760
I hate you, PayPal.

2354
02:57:55,760 --> 02:57:57,920
Let me just make this clear.

2355
02:57:57,920 --> 02:57:59,600
A cute single boy.

2356
02:57:59,600 --> 02:58:02,600
Yeah, single, straight, not gay.

2357
02:58:02,600 --> 02:58:06,800
Because I have a lot of gay male friends.

2358
02:58:06,800 --> 02:58:13,800
No, as in, not, I don't know, just not seeing anybody.

2359
02:58:13,800 --> 02:58:17,800
I want the age range of 21 to 27.

2360
02:58:17,800 --> 02:58:21,800
Yeah, exactly.

2361
02:58:21,800 --> 02:58:25,800
I'll let Jamie have the final thought. My final thought is

2362
02:58:25,800 --> 02:58:29,800
me and Evil Naoki 2DX, our

2363
02:58:29,800 --> 02:58:33,800
Japanese schoolgirl love-love sugar routine is going to be the best thing ever.

2364
02:58:33,800 --> 02:58:37,800
Jamie, your turn.

2365
02:58:37,800 --> 02:58:41,800
My turn?

2366
02:58:41,800 --> 02:58:46,800
I turned. No, but none of them saw that. That was bad radio.

2367
02:58:46,800 --> 02:58:51,800
My final thought is... I just thought it. Bye.

2368
02:58:51,800 --> 02:58:53,800
Okay. I thought my thoughts.

2369
02:58:53,800 --> 02:58:56,800
And tonight... I'm... I'm tired.

2370
02:58:56,800 --> 02:59:02,800
The last word of tonight's show goes to...

2371
02:59:02,800 --> 02:59:04,800
You've had it before.

2372
02:59:04,800 --> 02:59:07,800
Maren, because she didn't say a final word. Last word.

2373
02:59:07,800 --> 02:59:09,800
Burna Nation.

2374
02:59:09,800 --> 02:59:22,800
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio. Orange Lounge Radio is hosted by Dark Sakura, Skye and Loki. We expect you a nice play again. And now, here's your fortune cookie message of the day.

2375
02:59:29,800 --> 02:59:32,800
Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.

2376
02:59:33,800 --> 02:59:36,800
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.

2377
02:59:36,800 --> 02:59:41,800
Yo, G, I'll be here to see why your homies ain't working their booties off.

2378
02:59:41,800 --> 02:59:45,800
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.

2379
02:59:45,800 --> 02:59:51,800
We be seeing if they get this ride going with six foot seven of black staring down him.

2380
02:59:51,800 --> 02:59:55,800
I tell you that this station will be operational as planned.

2381
02:59:55,800 --> 03:00:00,800
Well, the man don't think so, and he be cruising down here to check out this ride.

2382
03:00:00,800 --> 03:00:02,800
The Empress coming here?

2383
03:00:02,800 --> 03:00:05,800
Yeah, and he gonna put a cap in your white ass.

2384
03:00:05,800 --> 03:00:07,800
We shall double our efforts.

2385
03:00:07,800 --> 03:00:12,800
Damn straight. And remember, this be CNN.

2386
03:00:12,800 --> 03:00:30,000
Thanks for listening and we'll see you next week.

2387
03:01:12,800 --> 03:01:16,800
And... Fade to black.

2388
03:01:16,800 --> 03:01:20,800
The afterbirth of Orange Lounge Radio.

2389
03:01:20,800 --> 03:01:24,800
Not the stillbirth, the afterbirth.

2390
03:01:24,800 --> 03:01:28,800
Anybody have anything extra they wanted to add that they didn't get out

2391
03:01:28,800 --> 03:01:32,800
during the three hours? Something that they don't want in the archives?

2392
03:01:36,800 --> 03:01:40,800
Wow. You're really white, you know that?

2393
03:01:40,800 --> 03:01:45,800
I want to play that song at the very end.

2394
03:01:45,800 --> 03:01:55,200
I didn't know Brad was married, does he have a wife?

2395
03:01:55,200 --> 03:02:06,440
Are they in Utah?

2396
03:02:06,440 --> 03:02:16,440
I'd just like to add an extra plug for our Bamani Music & More program, which is always on when we're not here, because we love people that listen to Orange Lawn's radio all the time.

2397
03:02:16,440 --> 03:02:20,440
I'd like to add an extra plug to your ass, Ron.

2398
03:02:20,440 --> 03:02:22,440
How do you know it's not already plugged?

2399
03:02:22,440 --> 03:02:24,440
There's too many plugs in there.

2400
03:02:24,440 --> 03:02:26,440
Oh, an extra plug, I'm sorry.

2401
03:02:26,440 --> 03:02:31,440
You know, you remember that sex scene in The Matrix with all the plugs?

2402
03:02:31,440 --> 03:02:44,960
I think this has been an enlightening experience, and I know this, that I'm surrounded by dirty

2403
03:02:44,960 --> 03:02:46,720
mofos.

2404
03:02:46,720 --> 03:02:47,720
You fit right in.

2405
03:02:47,720 --> 03:02:54,880
I'm a dirty mofo too, so I fit just right in.

2406
03:02:54,880 --> 03:02:55,880
Beautiful.

2407
03:02:55,880 --> 03:02:56,880
Hey Rob.

2408
03:02:56,880 --> 03:02:57,880
Yes.

2409
03:02:57,880 --> 03:02:58,880
Hey Rob?

2410
03:02:58,880 --> 03:02:59,880
Yes?

2411
03:02:59,880 --> 03:03:02,360
Do I have a phone sex operator voice?

2412
03:03:02,360 --> 03:03:03,360
Kinda.

2413
03:03:03,360 --> 03:03:04,360
Why?

2414
03:03:04,360 --> 03:03:05,880
A lot of guys tell me that for some odd reason when I'm on the phone.

2415
03:03:05,880 --> 03:03:12,440
Why don't you give us your best phone sex operator voice right now?

2416
03:03:12,440 --> 03:03:14,400
Let's pretend I'm calling a 900 line.

2417
03:03:14,400 --> 03:03:15,400
Okay, here we go.

2418
03:03:15,400 --> 03:03:18,960
This is me and Pixie S. This is me calling a straight 900 number line.

2419
03:03:18,960 --> 03:03:19,960
Okay, ready?

2420
03:03:19,960 --> 03:03:21,960
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.

2421
03:03:21,960 --> 03:03:22,960
Hello.

2422
03:03:22,960 --> 03:03:23,960
Hi.

2423
03:03:23,960 --> 03:03:26,640
What's your name, little boy?

2424
03:03:26,640 --> 03:03:27,640
My name is Brad.

2425
03:03:27,640 --> 03:03:37,680
Hello Brad, what are you wearing right now?

2426
03:03:37,680 --> 03:03:40,080
I'm wearing a red shirt and khakis.

2427
03:03:40,080 --> 03:03:43,160
Why are you wearing so much clothing?

2428
03:03:43,160 --> 03:03:45,160
Take it off.

2429
03:03:45,160 --> 03:03:46,160
Okay.

2430
03:03:46,160 --> 03:03:47,720
Why should I take it off?

2431
03:03:47,720 --> 03:03:50,080
Because you're a naughty, naughty boy.

2432
03:03:50,080 --> 03:03:55,880
And you know you want some miracle whip.

2433
03:03:55,880 --> 03:03:59,360
What are you going to do to me, Miss Phone Lady?

2434
03:03:59,360 --> 03:04:03,920
My name is Bambi, and I want to ravage your cunt.

2435
03:04:03,920 --> 03:04:05,480
I don't have a cunt.

2436
03:04:05,480 --> 03:04:11,940
Well, pretend you do.

2437
03:04:11,940 --> 03:04:20,440
You all can ravage your cunts all later.

2438
03:04:20,440 --> 03:04:22,200
I can't take it anymore.

2439
03:04:22,200 --> 03:04:23,200
Okay.

2440
03:04:23,200 --> 03:04:27,200
I hope that was good enough for you, baby, as good as it was for me.

2441
03:04:27,200 --> 03:04:29,200
I came. That was so great.

2442
03:04:29,200 --> 03:04:35,200
Oh, thank you.

2443
03:04:35,200 --> 03:04:41,200
I imagine these phone sex operators are probably sitting back there, you know, knitting.

2444
03:04:41,200 --> 03:04:46,200
Or doing their laundry or playing with their Game Boy while they're on the line.

2445
03:04:46,200 --> 03:04:49,200
No, that would be you, Jamie. You'd bring a Game Boy to work.

2446
03:05:19,200 --> 03:05:29,700
Oh yeah, it's a DDR machine. Oh God. Oh God. It does that. On the third mix, if you triple A it, it'll go, oh God, oh God, like that.

2447
03:05:33,200 --> 03:05:46,480
You guys are horrible. Bag. Okay, we're gonna go now. Good night, everybody. Loki would like to play a quick remix for you that he really likes, and then we're gonna have a mini 2DX marathon. So you guys should enjoy that, shouldn't you?

2448
03:05:46,480 --> 03:05:50,480
And, um, that'll be it.

2449
03:05:50,480 --> 03:05:52,480
So, Loki, introduce this mix.

2450
03:05:52,480 --> 03:05:54,480
This is Max Wishful.

2451
03:05:54,480 --> 03:05:58,200
It's a remix of Max 300 and...
