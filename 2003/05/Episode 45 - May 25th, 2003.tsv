289	3272	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, Season 3.
4173	7936	Now with 200% more hot monkey sex.
8276	10238	Just kidding.
10438	13761	Orange Lounge Radio will not contain 200% more hot monkey sex.
14102	16784	It will contain 300% more hot monkey sex.
16984	18185	Hey guys, cut the cut.
18325	21008	Okay, I guess it's back to the real intro.
21048	22990	Come on, I'm having fun too.
31412	35473	Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.
39099	43961	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio for mommy talk and then some.
44661	47362	Uh, mostly the and then some part of that.
47722	51724	Orange Lounge Radio is created by a bunch of potty-mouthed adults.
52384	57166	Orange Lounge may contain sexual, perverted, and mildly retarded content.
57746	61467	You probably shouldn't let your children listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
61788	63248	Yes, I will spank your child.
63648	65389	If you're not going to do your job, goddammit, I will.
70131	70432	Well...
71078	72218	Here's to my big opening.
72758	73919	A sphincter says what?
74059	76159	I'm super, thanks for asking.
76559	79120	Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.
79160	82440	What am I doing here?
82460	82881	No.
83021	84341	Dodge this.
84821	86681	This is a tasty burger.
86921	89362	Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.
89602	90242	Yes, I have.
90682	92443	Look, just a flesh wound.
92703	98764	Searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a polyshorum.
99910	100611	Oh yeah?
100731	104134	Well, I hope your babies look like monkeys.
104394	105455	DarkSakura.
105635	106436	I've got a sniff.
106796	107337	Sky.
107437	109519	But I'm playing it for the bartender, so suffer.
109899	110380	Loki.
110680	111681	I hate you!
112101	114143	Orange Lounge Radio.
115224	119828	Orange Lounge Radio is now live for this episode 45 here on May 25th of 2003.
123143	129648	You're tuned into the B-Money Scene's most sarsy radio station of all things B-Money.
132771	134852	My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.
135413	137294	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.
137314	140116	In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.
140157	141458	You know her better as DarkSakura.
145021	146122	Who just coughed up a lung?
146822	147163	Very nice.
147323	149785	You might want to go buy some masks at Walgreens or something.
149805	151706	No, I was going to buy some in San Francisco.
151726	154708	We found Star Wars masks in the Japan Center Mall.
155409	156169	That's cool.
156569	159311	I almost bought some, but I bought them on my own.
160292	161613	I have more Battle Royale.
163534	165476	In that corner, say hello to our Tech Master, Loki.
169999	171520	Is anybody feeling well?
171720	171820	God.
175091	177452	Also with us tonight, we have a whole assload of guests.
177632	179493	Some of them are out in the pool, but some of them are in-house.
179813	181734	First off, she's never been on the show before.
182154	184815	Be gentle and say hello to Maren Chan.
185515	186115	Where am I?
186135	188216	And what is this silver collar around my neck?
191537	191958	Beautiful.
192738	194338	Also, some old favorites.
194799	196699	Old and moldy, but still fresh.
197140	198660	Say hello to Dark Tetsuya.
198720	200201	Yeah, old and moldy.
200441	200721	What?
202441	203801	Say hello to DDR Angel.
204021	205242	Hello.
206662	208183	And say hello to the 23rd Magus.
208383	209363	Moldy, but still fresh.
210483	212184	What was that about Tofu?
212624	214565	And, oh, we got some people at the door.
214665	215045	Great.
215165	215705	More people.
215785	216785	Just what we need right now.
216865	218226	Let's see.
218546	220346	Let's hold off and see what comes through the door.
223127	225408	Oh, it's... Aww.
225808	228409	Aww, it's Loki's girlfriend.
228749	228829	Aww.
230169	230910	You are cute.
231030	231330	Come here.
231390	232090	Come here and say hello.
232111	233011	You've never been on the show.
233411	234112	Oh, she's shy.
234512	235633	She's shy.
236453	236774	Oh, well.
239536	242077	Okay, so I guess we'll get started with the show.
242858	248241	There's also four people that are out in the pool right now who aren't even in here right now, so maybe we'll hear from them later.
248502	249242	Hey, guess what, kids?
249282	250603	It's our season three premiere.
251584	252164	Yay.
252324	256227	Which means on the show tonight, somebody will get married, have a baby, or die.
257782	258903	Are we going to jump the shark?
259624	260885	Tonight we jump the shark.
262086	263767	I think we did that with the first episode.
264468	266710	Yeah, Orange Lodge Radio jumped the shark on the first episode.
268365	271568	Tell all your friends and all your lovers that Orange Lens Radio is now on the air.
271588	272268	And all your enemies.
273069	275050	And we're set for a big show tonight.
275071	276632	Is that your enemies on fire first?
276992	279654	We have two weeks of stuff to catch up on.
280175	280855	There's a lot tonight.
281516	284798	We're going to start this off with a song that created some big news this week.
284878	285939	It's a brand new song.
285999	287781	It's going to be a Max 2 USA.
288782	290683	And it's a group called Four Strings.
290743	292845	And this song is Take Me Away Into The Night.
293265	294947	And we'll be right back, boys and girls.
323119	350369	Take me away, million miles away from here Take me away, find a place for you and me You're taking me higher, high as I could be Take me away, forever you
411750	436012	A million miles away from me Take me away Find a place for you and me You're taking me higher Higher as I could be Take me away Forever you and me Take me away
501920	502560	Thanks for watching!
585706	588128	It's more contagious than SARS!
589089	598317	Orange Lounge Radio Yes, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, boys and girls.
600659	603541	Oh, there's shirtless men walking into my apartment.
604943	606324	It's April Fool's, it must be.
609287	613410	Um, anyway, hi.
613530	614911	Everybody just got flashed.
616312	618013	Hi, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
618453	619574	It's our season premiere.
619834	623296	As you can tell, we just had some nudity on this show.
623756	625718	Wow, it's like we're having a whole fashion show.
626738	631582	New characters coming in with gratuitous nudity in the first two minutes of the show.
634143	636785	Damn, too bad we weren't able to get the webcam up today after all.
637677	639080	Say hello, new people.
639120	640964	Introduce yourselves to the listeners of Orange Lounge Radio.
642767	643789	They're both running away.
643829	644431	You're not shy.
644491	644731	Come on.
644912	646915	I'm wet and I don't want to be on the radio right now.
646956	647116	Bye.
648698	650678	Oh, it's going to be one of those nights.
653159	654599	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
654879	665981	If you want to join our chat room, because the other party's on in the chat room, go to www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and then click on chat.
666621	669962	And that's how you can join in our chat room.
671142	672942	I can't believe you guys are already getting out of the pool.
673863	674963	I'm so sad.
674983	675943	I had to cry.
679335	679895	Oh, what?
681716	682036	Anyway.
684157	685477	Oh, snooty people came in and ruined the pool.
685537	687538	Okay, anyway, hi, back to the show.
689358	690659	Oh, Irene and Brad just came in.
690679	691099	Say hello.
691119	692299	How was the pool?
692319	692359	Oh.
692379	693560	Why are you afraid of pools?
693580	694520	Yeah.
707938	709038	Jamie, why are you afraid of pools?
709218	711379	Because little children pee and go poo.
712319	716201	I was at a public pool once, and I saw a big turd floating in the pool.
718441	720062	That reminds me of Caddyshack.
720382	721702	I actually saw it happen.
723643	729685	Anyway, let's talk about things that have happened while we were last on the air, which was two weeks ago.
729745	730425	I got SARS.
732085	733326	Okay, go in the shower.
734606	735506	We're trying to do a show here.
735526	735766	Hello.
736327	737507	Jamie, how was your two weeks?
738426	739967	Um, it was okay.
741108	743469	We sort of did a show last weekend, sort of.
743669	746290	Yeah, we broadcasted all day long from B3.
746350	748191	What did you guys think of B3?
748211	750953	What did you think of B3, the big tournament that happened at Pier 39?
751473	753974	I sort of missed all of Sunday because I decided to go to the mall.
754655	754895	Yeah?
757124	765648	I don't know, do you think B3, because a lot of people online were kind of like, kind of had this kind of, like you know how B3 is supposed to be like this huge tournament, you know, it's going to be like the biggest tournament ever?
765908	768349	And a lot of people just came back from it feeling kind of mediocre.
768389	770150	They were like, eh, PA kind of dominated the whole thing.
770170	773051	I think it was timing, because there was a lot going on around there.
773291	774651	I agree, I think it was just bad timing.
774691	783015	I think the original plan for B3 is that they were supposed to do it over spring break, and I think that would have been cool, but the time they did it just kind of turned out...
783935	784255	I don't know.
784856	790378	Yeah, it's too bad, because they ended up doing it the same weekend as E3, which caused a lot of confusion in the names alone.
791079	797702	I think it's weird, though, because everything at the tournament was put together really well, and everything was run really well.
797822	800363	I mean, sure, it ran a little late, but all tournaments do.
800924	807667	But yet, despite how great everything ran, everybody was just kind of bleh.
807967	811689	And freestyle, with the exception of two routines, was kind of bleh.
813345	813645	I don't know.
814305	815566	That's my little rant on B3.
816026	818407	I mean, it's certainly nobody's fault.
818467	824669	It's just kind of like, I think everybody just kind of must have had... I think everybody was on their collective period or something.
824709	825429	I think that's what it is.
827950	829130	Jamie, you're staring off into space.
829671	831011	Um, uh, yeah.
831691	832071	I'm sorry.
832172	833472	You have anything you want to say about B3, Loki?
835616	844369	Um, I didn't get a badge, and I didn't get a chair until after I asked, and I didn't get my free shirt does, promise.
845892	846933	Um, yeah.
848295	850078	You know what, um, B3, it...
852415	854697	Stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp
876591	887213	I think it gives me incentive anyway to broadcast for more tournaments in the future.
887533	888613	Can you guys shut the door?
889933	890554	Jesus.
892794	894334	Irene's speaking in on Garrett.
895694	897655	I have three people in my shower right now.
898615	900235	This is all the season premiere stuff going on.
900255	904316	We had nudity, new characters, and now they're all in my shower at the same time.
905171	906772	I saw Garrett's ass.
906952	909293	He's showing me a scar by his ass.
909313	909773	How funny.
915356	918477	She says she's right here, staying in the studio, not even taking a shower.
920838	921698	But she's in the shower.
921758	922259	I don't believe her.
924120	929782	Segway, Segway, while we were sort of on the subject of B3, Loki, I believe you owe me something?
930682	932343	Perhaps, I don't know, an apology.
933364	934084	As promised.
935270	936571	You are on the spot!
937312	939674	Loki's eyes got really big like a deer in headlights.
939734	940714	He doesn't even remember.
942436	943597	What the hell are you talking about?
943617	948040	What?
948220	949461	What the hell are you talking about?
949541	950102	Seriously?
954445	954966	Of what?
956007	957848	You need to remind Loki what he said that made you mad.
957868	960150	How many of us actually keep up with what goes on in these episodes?
964457	969338	I believe there was this really bad, wait, what was the second day of freestyle?
970238	971719	First day was PAM freestyle.
972819	984202	Yeah, I think it was a really bad freestyle, and then you're like, oh my god, if these people that were here were at Shaft and booing Magus off, they would boo the other guy off instead and cheer Magus on.
984722	985322	I was confused.
985402	985942	Anyway, whatever.
985962	987923	Yeah, because that guy really sucked.
989043	993844	I mean, he was like, oh my god, spazzing up on the pad.
994485	997786	And this is really for me who went out to go get Oyakodon.
997806	999586	But no, no apologies, sorry.
1003387	1005107	As Magus shows Loki his IQ of 1.
1006528	1007348	Very, very nice.
1009488	1011189	I hear you turning dials.
1012869	1014229	This camera is the suck.
1020250	1022431	No wonder these are buy one get one free, they're ass.
1024451	1026472	So why are we having all this dead airspace, Rob?
1026652	1029854	I have no idea, because I'm too distracted by the people in my shower right now.
1030554	1033756	Because I keep hearing nudity and oh my god and ass and tattoo and scarf.
1033776	1035757	Why don't you just put them all out in the yard and get the water hose?
1037318	1041160	First, Irene walks in the door when Garrett's changing.
1041180	1042600	She doesn't bother knocking.
1043181	1047843	This time she knows that he's in the shower, but she opens the shower curtain anyway.
1048604	1049364	And he's naked.
1049644	1051285	He had a towel around him, okay?
1056397	1057118	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1078021	1079041	Hey, I caught it!
1079061	1079462	Woohoo!
1079782	1079982	Huh?
1080402	1082323	Yeah, tell us about the movie we watched Thursday night.
1082763	1084584	It sucked ass, kinda.
1084924	1088165	It was kinda boring and I don't even know why the hell you got me to watch it.
1089966	1092086	Never rent whatever the hell that movie was.
1093887	1094407	It was bad.
1097068	1098309	Envy of the dot dot dot.
1098973	1101634	The film that we watched was called Envy.
1101854	1103095	Actually, it says Envy on the box.
1103155	1105176	It's actual full title is called Penis Envy.
1105736	1108137	It's a story about these two drifting chicks.
1108157	1109378	They're walking through the desert.
1109838	1111979	They go to this bar and they get really drunk.
1112039	1114560	And I mean, this is talking about like white trash America.
1115121	1116902	They get drunk and they're walking through the desert.
1117022	1120323	And all of a sudden they go, gee, wouldn't it be great to have a penis?
1120683	1128207	And so they walk around and lo and behold, when this one chick's taking a piss, they find the penis fairy, which is this giant drag queen.
1128687	1129227	Hey, Loki?
1143618	1144618	Was it Mr. Spanky?
1144638	1145759	That was beautiful, thank you.
1172304	1178185	Anyway, let's try to focus on some Bomani news, because there was lots of it while we were gone for two weeks.
1178705	1189148	So, Max 2 USA was the big kind of announcement that, well, there were several games that were announced at E3, the big convention that none of us got to go to, because nobody takes this show seriously.
1189288	1190048	Hey, I could have gone.
1190968	1192908	You could have been able to go, but not because of this show.
1193269	1194269	I couldn't get off work.
1194789	1195369	Oh, I'm sorry.
1197202	1201165	But there were lots of fun things discussed at E3.
1201625	1215436	First off was Max 2 USA, and we heard a bunch of songs were announced for inclusion, including Days Go By by Dirty Vegas, the song you heard in the last break, Four Strings Take Me Away Into The Night, and also Jocelyn and Rika's A Little Bit Of Ecstasy.
1215516	1219799	All those songs, by the way, are in rotation right now on our station, so if you want to check them out.
1221221	1226825	But what's interesting, what I find really interesting about Max 2 USA is that the real music videos are going to be in the backgrounds now.
1228530	1229490	That's going to be pretty cool.
1230211	1239333	Do you think that there's going to be an option where you can select, oh, I want the big seizure, flashy-looking graphics, amazing Japanese fun, or you can have the real music video?
1242314	1244755	I don't know, but it doesn't bother me either way.
1245395	1248676	I wonder if they're going to have long versions because of the music videos.
1250216	1251177	Long versions, that would be interesting.
1251517	1255318	You know they've promised, I guess, different modes that we haven't seen in the U.S.
1255378	1255738	before?
1259145	1261646	So, like, music video mode, like, where you could just watch the videos.
1261986	1266086	Kind of like, okay, you remember in 2DX6 style how you could just watch the videos if you wanted to?
1266406	1267467	You think they'll have something like that?
1267487	1269107	That'd be cool.
1269847	1270687	Yes, that would be neat.
1271147	1277809	Because I know, I've had gatherings where people just put in 6th style and watch the videos and drank.
1280629	1281549	I could go for some drink.
1282649	1285090	Do they have the mode where you get to meet Kuriyama Oka?
1285110	1285250	Yeah.
1288331	1291773	He was at E3, and yeah.
1291933	1295496	Because I don't really give a shit about Max 2 USA, or any DDR.
1295836	1298117	I want to see Akira Moka.
1300238	1301999	Why don't you give a shit about Max 2 USA?
1302019	1304361	Because I'll tell you right now, it's going to be better than Japanese Max 2.
1304401	1307042	Because I played the Japanese Max 2 for three days, and I haven't played since.
1308503	1310144	Because this DDR sucks.
1311385	1312345	I play Beatmania.
1312545	1314426	When are they going to bring out a new console Beatmania?
1314446	1315267	That's all I care about.
1317526	1319187	Oh, that was the other interesting bit of news.
1319227	1325412	There was this big rumor going around that Konami was going to... I know we talked about this on the show, and we read it with extreme caution.
1325432	1326593	I think I called it, didn't I?
1326933	1327273	Oh, yeah.
1327673	1330355	I'm pretty sure we all approached it with this big bit of skepticism.
1330515	1332977	If I remember right, the news source wasn't a very trustworthy one.
1333437	1342524	But they were announcing 2DX USA, and they were going to have a machine brought to E3, and they were going to bring in, like, Take and Yes... Or, no, not them.
1342584	1343204	Lisu and...
1344185	1344786	Who's the other guy?
1344886	1345247	Agop.
1345587	1350974	They're going to bring in Lisu and Agop and have them playing at E3 to show Americans how to play 2DX?
1351315	1352156	What a bunch of crap.
1353998	1355040	So that didn't end up happening.
1355981	1357002	But I don't know.
1357423	1360667	I'm pretty sure we talked about it on the show before, but does the USA really deserve 2DX?
1363996	1376601	If they brought 2DX to the USA, it wouldn't sell for shit, like how everyone said that they complained that frequency was too difficult, so they made Amplitude easier, and hence it became an even bigger piece of crap.
1378361	1379242	I like Amplitude.
1379262	1385404	Would you like to repeat that for our listeners?
1386244	1387344	I like Super Sprout.
1387484	1388725	That song's cool, and that's about it.
1390194	1394076	Wait, so before we move on to other games, nobody has any other thoughts on Max 2 USA?
1394156	1395396	Like, is anybody looking forward to it?
1396076	1397317	Um... Nobody cares?
1397577	1400598	It'll be out, but, you know... It'll be fun for about a week.
1401278	1401898	You know what, though?
1401919	1403319	I am going to have the Xbox one.
1404459	1405720	Oh, yeah, that's the other one we can talk about.
1405740	1408801	I have no choice because we get everything cool that comes out on Xbox.
1411262	1414623	I mean, I got Steel Battalion, of course I'm going to have DDR.
1414903	1416384	Although the dance pad looks retarded.
1416924	1417464	It's green.
1417945	1418765	And it's official, though.
1421152	1423255	I don't know, the dance pads are kind of scary to me.
1423315	1424616	They're all freaky looking.
1425177	1426258	They're Xbox-y.
1426479	1428501	Well, Xbox, everything is freaky looking.
1429342	1430764	They're actually Konami-made pads.
1433255	1439878	Well, you know the producer of the DDR Xbox game was on DDR Freak earlier this week, and he said a few things about the game, which are interesting.
1440398	1446061	He says that the look of the game that they showed at E3 is not representative of the final gameplay.
1446601	1452163	So in that version there was no 3D, no music videos, and haven't even begun to show what the Xbox is capable of.
1452723	1458566	So I guess that's kind of interesting, because I guess in a way they're saying, hey, Max 2 USA was further along than DDR Xbox was.
1461590	1467633	Also, Freeze Arrows will be in DDR Ultramix, except there were none in E3.
1468794	1470695	They're going to be able to play it online.
1470715	1474577	So you're going to be able to get on Xbox Live and have live rankings and statistics.
1475476	1486986	and your individual scores will be able to be ranked with the rest of the people via a live connection and you can also have edited step data and you can upload and download that by users and new songs will be released on a monthly basis for download.
1487306	1490649	However, there's a rumor going around that says you might have to pay for these songs.
1490709	1491069	Who knows?
1492110	1493391	Yeah, what is that about?
1493431	1500317	I mean, if it were like for the licensed stuff, I could understand, but if it were for Konami originals, I mean, that doesn't sound fair.
1502193	1504794	Especially if they're all songs we've played to death already.
1504874	1509115	I don't think I could rationalize paying like five bucks for a new song or something, you know?
1510215	1514396	Would anybody here actually admit to paying for new DDR songs just so they could have everything?
1514696	1514896	No.
1514916	1518397	Okay, that's a no.
1518517	1519358	How about the chatroom?
1520678	1521018	I don't know.
1521418	1522719	I'm not even watching the chatroom right now.
1524019	1524479	Chatroom?
1524519	1525239	Who cares about them?
1526560	1527040	We do.
1527220	1527860	I love chatroom.
1530321	1531361	You hang out in our chatroom?
1532091	1533852	It sounds like a cheap, interesting way to make money.
1534693	1536594	But don't you... Correct me if I'm wrong, Jamie.
1536614	1538135	You're the one that's played Xbox online.
1538255	1539375	I don't think anyone else here has.
1539756	1542117	No, I watched Dan play it.
1542357	1543118	Street Fighter.
1544138	1546160	Don't you have to pay per month for that anyway?
1547280	1547961	Xbox Live?
1548021	1548281	Yeah.
1548801	1549081	Yeah.
1549722	1552924	So now you're going to have to pay per month and pay per song you want to download.
1552944	1553564	You shouldn't have to.
1553824	1554064	I know.
1554144	1554625	That's gay.
1555946	1557607	It's called licensing rights.
1557887	1558167	Yay!
1559721	1561821	Pretty soon there's going to be a Napster for DDR.
1566162	1567702	Actually, why not?
1567842	1568643	I mean, think about it.
1568763	1570103	You're downloading a program.
1570123	1574324	I mean, people could share programs online.
1574484	1575124	I mean, why not?
1576044	1578504	I'm sure they'll have a site where you can download them illegally.
1580945	1588266	Anyway, also the producer of Ultramix says that there's going to be 55 songs planned for the US version, 10 of those licensed.
1589031	1592914	And if I'm not mistaking, only five of them in Max USA were licensed.
1592974	1594255	So, that's going to be interesting.
1595135	1599518	And also, kind of a big one, there's no Ultramix PC version.
1599558	1601480	There was a big rumor that it was going to be out for the PC.
1602100	1603121	That got shot down.
1603781	1608665	The reason why I pretty much figured it wouldn't happen, there's already DDRPC.
1609525	1610486	But it sucks.
1610826	1611867	It really sucks.
1611887	1612948	It does, true, but...
1614447	1616228	You know why Pump It Up for PC worked?
1616688	1616828	Why?
1616848	1619029	Because Pump It Up was made for a PC anyway.
1619689	1620389	That's very true.
1622190	1623971	It runs off the PC software anyways.
1625892	1630654	All the big Pump It Up machine that giant machine is, it's just there's a little PC in there that runs everything.
1631614	1631754	Yep.
1632941	1637143	But I don't know, I think, but you know, what's weird about DDRPC, look at Stepmania.
1637543	1639904	Stepmania does it way better than DDRPC did.
1640204	1651548	So it's kind of like, you can't use the excuse that it's not possible to do on a computer, because Stepmania, hey, if they'd released something like that as DDRPC, I bet a lot of people would have been, you know, would have been, wow, this is great.
1653448	1657750	Stepmania, and then we'll go, oh, I'll just download all these songs or make my own that I think are better.
1659506	1663830	Yeah, do you think that maybe that's why they've given up on DDRPC, because of Step Mania?
1664811	1666492	I would probably think so.
1667133	1669354	You know, how can you compete with something that's free?
1670976	1673158	Why do you think Konami hasn't sued the people who made Step Mania?
1674307	1675268	Anybody want to venture a guess?
1675588	1696020	I would think, well, first of all, the programming itself, if they did not, what's the word I'm trying to think, reverse engineer it, if they actually made it right from scratch with their own source, they can't sue them for using, that's the whole problem with Bleem, why they couldn't do Bleem, because they made their program for Bleem from scratch.
1696480	1699102	Can't they sue for the whole look and feel thing, though?
1699382	1702704	I'm thinking back to, you remember when Street Fighter 2 was out, and then I think,
1703536	1709638	Some other third party company, I want to say Data East, put out a game called like Fighting Streets or something like that.
1710819	1711759	Was it Fighters History?
1712339	1713900	I think they used the Street Fighter engine.
1714260	1715821	And they got sued and all this stuff?
1715861	1717341	I think it's because they used the Street Fighter engine.
1717381	1717701	Did they?
1719002	1721163	But I would think, you know, that whole look and feel thing would come to play.
1721183	1725724	I mean, obviously none of us want to see the step many people get sued, but you know, it's a question that has to be asked.
1725824	1726785	Why hasn't it happened yet?
1726865	1729306	Especially if Konami wants to be competitive in the PC market.
1730126	1730326	Angel?
1732912	1733132	Sorry.
1737193	1737633	Yes, Angel.
1738273	1744294	Puppy just pointed out in the chat room that Stepmania is open source code, so, I mean, he's got a point there.
1745214	1746214	Okay, yeah, that's a good point.
1746734	1748815	Which is what Jamie just pointed out, so, you know.
1752715	1759357	It's open source, so even if they did get sued, it's kind of like, it doesn't matter at this point because the cat's already out of the bag.
1763815	1766277	So, hmm, interesting thought.
1769160	1770801	How do you guys think the online play is going to work?
1770841	1773183	Is there anything you guys would like to see online for DDR?
1773223	1780749	Because I think that whole, like, being able to play with somebody at the same time, it's kind of stupid, because you can't see them.
1780849	1781430	What would you see?
1781450	1784913	You'd just see this second side of your screen getting perfect, good, boo.
1786397	1793739	I think you'll see fifty wasted dollars coming out of your check every month for spending on Xbox Live, the biggest piece of bullshit ever.
1795199	1797699	Thank you for that happy comment, Mr. Brad.
1801220	1807461	Um... Okay, so we've got DDR Xbox out of the way.
1808082	1809942	How about Karaoke Revolution?
1810142	1810982	What do you guys think of this?
1812042	1814443	This is kind of the... I hate karaoke, so...
1815202	1816203	You hate karaoke?
1816223	1817684	Yeah, because I don't sing, remember?
1817904	1818365	I cry.
1819065	1822288	I like watching other people so I can make fun of them, but I don't like doing it.
1823048	1828012	This is interesting, though, because it's the first, it's kind of the first U.S.-only Bomani game.
1828032	1830674	Oh, it is?
1830694	1837019	Kind of, yeah, they haven't made any, well, I mean, they have games like it in Japan, but not Konami, and not in the Bomani series.
1837640	1837980	I'm sorry?
1838260	1840482	I thought they had a karaoke revolution machine or something.
1840979	1847302	The closest thing they have to a Karaoke Revolution machine, I remember seeing this, it was a DDR slash karaoke machine.
1847782	1848562	It was like both.
1849703	1850683	But who could follow that?
1850843	1852484	Hey, you know what I saw at Network the other day?
1852964	1853144	What?
1853484	1854425	Aerobics Revolution.
1855845	1857226	Oh yeah, that finally came out, huh?
1857466	1861247	I was tempted to pick it up, but it was like $75 and more expensive.
1861568	1864389	And if I was going to pay $75 in a game, I would have picked up Final Fantasy X-2.
1866305	1868606	You know what, like, Aerobics Revolution wouldn't even be worth it.
1869206	1874467	I saw a bunch of screenshots of it, and it looks really kind of odd.
1874647	1876368	Loses the whole point.
1876508	1883590	I mean, seriously, it is like they just, like they said, you're doing some 80s James Fonda kind of thing to it.
1883690	1885030	It's got, like, some chicks on it.
1885370	1888171	You know, you're trying to follow their moves as you're stepping on the pad.
1888711	1894793	Basically, yeah, you're doing aerobics stuff, and you just so happen to be standing on a pad, too, while you're doing it.
1895593	1895753	So...
1897845	1903327	Yep, my cheap camera What was that song that we figured out was confirmed for Karaoke Revolution?
1903367	1925836	We figured out there's some Jennifer Love Hewitt song we figured out by the screen captures that's going to be in it for sure I don't know We found out the other day and we forgot already But Jennifer Love Hewitt was Jennifer Love Hewitt was there at E3 singing And it was off her latest CD but it wasn't the one that's the name of the CD Oh well
1931491	1934433	Anyway, we're going to go ahead and take a quick break.
1934513	1936574	And when we come back, we'll talk about more of E3.
1938075	1939956	And we'll do the fuck you's of the week.
1940176	1943177	So you can send those to me over private message in the chat room.
1943217	1945599	My name is Sky, and you can send those to me.
1945619	1946879	And if you're not in our chat room, you should be.
1947219	1951822	Go to www.callybomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on chat.
1952222	1956805	So we'll talk a little more about E3 and all that garbage when we get back.
1958526	1959066	Enjoy.
2038792	2043175	Follow the sound, follow the sound, and even the rain behind.
2044276	2047438	Together we'll be in harmony, taking the time.
2139826	2142630	Thanks for watching!
2222662	2231265	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
2231545	2239469	That's right, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
2239489	2240389	Welcome back, everybody.
2241729	2245311	We decided to play some happy Rayvar songs in that last break, so we hope you enjoyed.
2247588	2249049	We also figured out what song it is.
2249149	2250490	It's going to be in Karaoke Revolution.
2250510	2251531	It's called Hey Everybody.
2252672	2255154	It's from Jennifer Love Hewitt.
2256495	2257395	And I'm sure it sucks.
2257736	2258876	But how did you find that song?
2259697	2265381	Based off of the lyrics that are shown in the screen caps on the Konami website, actually.
2265401	2269404	They have a few pictures up that aren't from the E3 showing.
2269484	2271146	So I got it off of that.
2272146	2274148	And then you did a lyric search and there you go.
2274788	2275309	Amazing.
2276178	2284140	But, um, it was during the break, somebody, I think it was, I don't know if it was Garrett or somebody commented that the chick in Karaoke Revolution in the screenshots looks like an American Idol reject.
2285821	2287301	She, actually, you know what she looks like?
2287661	2290502	Has anybody ever played the Spice World video game for PlayStation?
2290782	2292463	Oh god, that game sucks.
2292483	2296244	Where they have, like, the giant head and the little, little anorexic body?
2296924	2298584	That's what that chick looked like to me.
2298604	2303966	I'm hoping everybody was moaning and groaning because they haven't played it and they're sad that you're the only one who has.
2304990	2305691	Aw, don't cry for me.
2305711	2308355	I don't want to know that all these people have played the Spice Roam game.
2308375	2310839	That's really... I know your girlfriend has.
2310859	2312801	I had a free rental and I wanted to see how bad it was.
2313743	2314924	Okay, get this.
2314944	2319290	The first time I met my ex-girlfriend, the very first day I meet her, she's like...
2321759	2327244	I had to, she said, you know, you have to see this game, and so I'm like, oh no, Spice World, what is this?
2327645	2335452	And then she showed me what was so funny about it, and yeah, it was pretty funny, but you guys must have been really drunk when you first saw that game, or when you thought about buying that game, Rob.
2335632	2338735	You had to be drunk.
2339196	2342799	I do own that game, it's in a deep, I think it's in my closet.
2343860	2345462	I'm gonna have to go take it out at some point.
2347806	2349588	So, yeah, what else was announced at E3?
2349608	2350288	I know there were other games.
2350308	2353891	What about other cool games, just non-Bomani necessarily, that y'all are looking forward to?
2354592	2355592	I know Brad had one.
2356993	2360316	Alright, Brad, tell me about some games you're looking forward to at E3.
2360496	2361417	Not necessarily Bomani.
2363158	2365080	Okay, Konami stuff, or just anything?
2366401	2366681	Anything.
2366761	2375708	Okay, Half-Life 2, Metal Gear Solid 3, Metal Gear Solid Twin Snakes, and Castlevania, Lament of Innocence.
2377452	2379913	What's the weird voice acting?
2379933	2381093	What's the weird voice acting?
2381313	2383774	Yes, but it's not as bad as Die, Monster!
2384454	2385935	You don't belong in this world!
2386635	2388876	They need to do another Dracula X game with Richter.
2390016	2392317	A new Gradius game, definitely.
2393017	2396238	Mario Kart Double Dash.
2397358	2399479	There's a new Sam & Max game.
2400920	2404021	New Sam & Max game, new Full Throttle game from LucasArts.
2407464	2409085	Who cares about that game?
2409105	2410967	Let's see what else.
2411787	2414949	There's... I don't know.
2415069	2415710	There's cool games.
2416390	2417871	Mario Party 5, bitches.
2419552	2423915	Mario Advance 4, Super Mario Bros.
2424335	2423915	3.
2425877	2428238	Or the new Pokemon Stadium on GameCube.
2431720	2433201	Metroid Zero Mission.
2434422	2435343	Oh yeah, the new Metroid.
2435363	2435503	Metroid.
2437509	2438310	No, advance.
2439611	2439751	Really?
2445416	2445716	Yeah.
2446577	2447177	Neopets.
2448118	2448738	Oh, that's right.
2448758	2450340	There's a Neopets game coming out, huh?
2450400	2451040	For PS2.
2451841	2452401	Oh, God.
2452982	2453903	The world is ending.
2455304	2457626	Dan brought back a million copies of that Army game.
2459828	2460748	That's not related to... The U.S.
2460808	2461409	Army put out.
2462190	2462730	The U.S.
2462810	2463631	Army put out a game?
2464659	2473686	They put out a game on the PC a while back, um, to, it's, it's for the help, you know, them recruit more people, but, um, it's, it's just an online game.
2473826	2475507	It uses the Unreal Engine, I believe.
2475527	2477168	Dan said it was pretty cool, though.
2477909	2482232	And, um, he said Gradius V was really awesome.
2484577	2486238	and this is really yummy.
2486298	2489020	The chat room has some interesting things that they said that nobody said yet.
2489280	2492383	Phantasy Star Online Episode 3, definitely.
2493363	2494844	We need to start playing PSO again.
2495125	2497286	World of Warcraft and Starcraft Ghost.
2499087	2502270	Doom 3 is going to be horrible, says somebody.
2503070	2504231	Doom 3 is going to be horrible.
2506852	2507633	Uh-oh, here goes Brad.
2507653	2509034	Why is Doom 3 going to be horrible?
2509175	2509535	I don't know.
2509595	2511497	Because the person doesn't like first-person shooters?
2511998	2512418	I don't know.
2512438	2512859	That's fine.
2512959	2517484	If you don't like first-person shooters, I don't expect you to like it, but as far as first-person shooters are concerned, it's going to be freaking great.
2517764	2519085	I've played the Alpha League.
2520186	2521688	It is incredible.
2521728	2523410	It runs like shit on my computer, but it's great.
2523490	2524511	This is the justification.
2524872	2527174	No multiplayer, and it's going to be completely linear.
2527995	2528796	Well, Brad...
2530259	2533701	Then play Unreal Tournament or Quake 3.
2533761	2534842	That's what those are for.
2535422	2537303	They make Doom for online play.
2537343	2538684	They never did in the first place.
2538824	2542987	The reason why Doom 3 is going to be shitty is because they've spent too goddamn long on it.
2544287	2544748	I am 20.
2546689	2554834	I remember my friends showing me previews of this when they had, you know, like at conventions with movies of it when I was a sophomore in high school.
2556554	2569445	It's, you know, it's kind of gotten outdated, you know, because when they had their brilliant engine back then and it looked gorgeous, now it looks like shit, and... It still does look gorgeous, and, I mean, that happens with a lot of games.
2569465	2572028	Look at Dragon Quest VII, Dragon Warrior VII.
2572368	2575030	That has been in the making for, like, what, five, six years?
2575330	2576531	And it came out eventually.
2577412	2580375	Yeah, but it eventually came out here, and it's still a great game.
2580475	2583778	Just because it's dated-looking still doesn't mean it's not a good game.
2585424	2591866	I actually had an issue of Newtype where they had a review of Dragon Quest VII that was two years old.
2596327	2601909	But I want them to do, like, another Secret of Mana using sprites.
2602549	2605030	Oh, then again, we have Ragnarok, so what else do we need?
2606178	2624446	Yeah, Sword of Mana, which I call it over here, it's the redo of the Seiken Densetsu game, the first one that was called Final Fantasy Adventure on Game Boy, which is a great game, you know, but this one looks, they updated it to make it look more like Seiken Densetsu 3, so, mmm, looks awesome.
2624486	2629469	That's what I need is Seiken Densetsu 3 on my GBA, that'd make me happy.
2629829	2631950	All I need to do is just slap the ROM on there, there you go.
2634642	2640656	They do have the Flash Advance cards if you want to spend like $250 just for the little ROM cartridge and then you can load ROMs.
2642734	2647418	with a front loader program, or not front loader, a run-in program that'll emulate the ROMs for you.
2647679	2657708	I heard something... That reminds me, some other hardware things I heard about from E3, they're gonna have something they're releasing for the GBA, where you can watch full motion video for like 30 minutes on a cartridge.
2657948	2664474	Yeah, they have that already in Japan, you can get it from Lixang.com, but... I always giggle whenever I hear that website.
2664594	2667117	Lixang, sounds like something in an Asian porno.
2671440	2684028	You know one thing I saw at Network yesterday was the Game Boy Advance player for the GameCube.
2684588	2685549	I want me one of those.
2685749	2687010	It's pretty cool.
2687230	2689212	It like sits on the bottom of those, kind of weird.
2690933	2693995	I think there's some comments wanting to be made in the corner that haven't been made yet.
2694315	2695356	Jamie and I are whoring it.
2695536	2695836	It's okay.
2697284	2698284	Omega's trapped in the corner.
2698544	2709628	Well, Brad, while we were still on that topic, and not trampling it flat, if you like your single-player, first-person, linear shooters, you can go to hell.
2709808	2710328	You know what?
2710588	2711128	I like them.
2711368	2712048	I'll join you.
2713949	2714949	I don't think I get it.
2715249	2716810	I can go to hell and you'll join me?
2717570	2718110	What was your point?
2718150	2719651	You like linear or you don't?
2721111	2723912	Ha ha, because Doom takes place in hell!
2726337	2727358	Nice, nice recovery.
2727378	2729339	I'm a geek, but I'm not that geeky, sorry.
2730761	2737426	I remember being in college, right after graduation, going to my friend Marcy's house and playing Doom.
2738227	2739788	And we'd all be like, hurt me plenty!
2740048	2740368	Woo!
2740889	2741850	Thinking we were all badass.
2743195	2745738	You know, we just thought we were awesome because we could play on Nightmare.
2745998	2753225	You know, I hate to bring this up again, but why is it that I did not know, I swear I did not know any girls that played video games until after I was out of college.
2753385	2754226	Long after I was out of college.
2754246	2756008	I played video games all throughout when I was in high school.
2756028	2757510	How come I didn't have friends like you?
2758820	2759601	Because you suck.
2762043	2766867	I think I was just too preppy or something, and all my friends were in the band and cheerleading.
2767027	2768208	I worked in an arcade.
2768809	2770671	I was the only girl who played Tekken 3.
2771852	2774174	It was Namco Arcade, so we had Tekken 3 before everybody else.
2774614	2777656	And weren't you known as the girl who played Tekken 3 who kicked all their asses?
2805086	2806586	And this is five years later.
2806666	2807547	No, four years later.
2808027	2808727	The legacy.
2809567	2811228	But the legend still burns.
2812528	2813128	Oh, please.
2815189	2815769	Someone in there.
2816109	2825012	I went back to that cyber station, though, and, like, proceeded to... It's funny seeing all these people just sort of slapping at the Dance Maniacs machine and then I'm playing, like, you know, Miggle style.
2825712	2826212	It was funny.
2826953	2829333	And then, so, we got a bunch of girl gamers in the room.
2829353	2829873	That's cool.
2829993	2831714	Like, how long have you been playing video games, Maren?
2833698	2835200	I've been playing video games since I was 10.
2836261	2841766	That's so cool.
2842347	2843949	What was the first video game you remember playing?
2844870	2846752	Super Mario Bros.
2847092	2846752	2.
2848093	2848313	Right.
2848353	2849735	And then Legend of Zelda.
2851336	2851757	Very cool.
2852469	2853570	You know what my first one was?
2853750	2853950	What?
2854651	2856472	My first game was Pitfall.
2857273	2857833	On the Atari 2600?
2857894	2858214	Uh-huh.
2858754	2859215	I take that back.
2859255	2861577	My neighbors across the street were girls and they loved that game.
2861617	2862377	They made me play it.
2862718	2863798	And Kangaroo.
2865100	2866160	Kangaroo was shitty.
2866381	2867041	Oh, bite me.
2867101	2867562	I don't care.
2867962	2873046	Hey, I played Kangaroo in an arcade at Godfather's Pizza.
2873587	2874387	So, ha.
2875188	2875688	I'm older.
2876189	2878691	I remember playing a brand new Donkey Kong machine.
2879815	2881936	I remember playing a cocktail machine as Batman.
2881956	2884056	Now, you I would expect to be playing Kongo Bongo.
2884757	2885317	I never played it.
2885437	2887237	Because it's the Sega thing, but whatever.
2887617	2890718	I figured maybe you started... I played Space Fury and Gorp on my Clicca Vision.
2892139	2894119	I was going to ask Angel, since she's a girl gamer too.
2894500	2895640	Yeah?
2895680	2897020	First one you remember playing.
2897621	2898241	Oh, God.
2898821	2900281	It was either... Shit.
2900481	2900982	What was it called?
2901482	2902402	The damn computer one.
2904023	2905303	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
2906618	2908259	I was born with a controller in my hand!
2908279	2909719	I've been playing games forever!
2934997	2939418	I was either like four or five and it was either Super Mario Brothers or Metroid.
2939438	2939919	I can't remember.
2939939	2941179	It was like at my neighbor's house.
2941979	2942479	It was cool.
2942579	2945980	Then I got my Nintendo while I was in kindergarten and I was a freak from then on.
2946901	2947261	Yes.
2947561	2949702	I had a Nintendo jacket in the fourth grade.
2949942	2950542	I owned you.
2950602	2951042	Dork!
2951802	2954203	That's why the girls didn't talk to you.
2954443	2960545	It's not because... But, did you ever get a hold of Super Mario Brothers cereal?
2961945	2964006	Yes, Super Mario Brothers cereal was the shit.
2964981	2966122	What's going on?
2966162	2967484	Why is everybody yaying here?
2969986	2971428	Put Jamie on the mic.
2971448	2973290	Put Jamie on the mic and explain what they're eating.
2973390	2974471	We're eating Dried Squid.
2975732	2975952	Alright.
2978175	2979136	Back to the reminiscing.
2980305	2983287	Back to the reminiscing first video game ever topic, because I like this topic.
2983907	2992152	The first one I remember was at Chuck E. Cheese, back when they would have the room with the strobe light, and it was like, cool, you know, how 80s was this?
2992852	2996814	I remember being like three or four and playing Crystal Castles at Chuck E. Cheese.
2996875	2997555	Oh my god.
2997975	2999336	Crystal Castles was the shit.
2999356	3002097	When he dies, he goes, oh, no.
3003418	3005020	Or he goes, ouch.
3005500	3006501	And then he flies away.
3007081	3009163	And see, it had that giant trackball thing.
3009423	3011605	So one could say I was attracted to balls at a young age.
3015448	3017089	Oh, God, we just lost half our listeners.
3017129	3017569	What do you know?
3019771	3020692	And gained some new ones.
3021532	3024074	Ew, it looks like... I'm not going to eat it.
3024114	3025215	It's gross looking.
3026396	3027877	Give me some squid.
3028778	3030159	It smells like punani.
3030379	3031740	I'm going to eat it live on the air.
3032301	3032661	All right.
3034103	3037307	I think now is a good time to get into the... Wait, does anybody want to reminisce first games?
3037327	3038187	Because we didn't get to everybody.
3038228	3038728	Dark Tetsuya?
3042171	3047477	Well, you know, you... Actually, it's kind of... It kind of reminds me of beef jerky.
3049248	3051869	My favorite is beef jerky.
3052029	3052910	Oh, God, I don't know.
3053150	3053990	Fast food, $2,600.
3054610	3060052	Oh, was that the one where you're the little chef and, like, if you lost, then all the food would get thrown at you?
3060092	3061573	No, no, no.
3062033	3063393	Your little purple mouth thingy.
3063413	3064894	I know the game.
3064994	3066855	I know the game.
3066875	3067315	Tapping.
3069576	3069676	Oh.
3069736	3070296	Ooh, Rob.
3070556	3070856	Dang.
3070916	3073757	Rob, did you shoot what he did?
3073797	3075398	You just got me and Brad confused, didn't you?
3075418	3075458	No.
3075478	3076318	Because everybody does that.
3076338	3077579	No, I said, Rob, did you shoot what he did?
3077739	3078139	Oh, what'd he do?
3081181	3082643	Watch out, I don't know if there's some pussy at you.
3086467	3089871	Alright, let's finish up the others in the room.
3090072	3091233	Eat the squid.
3091253	3093796	Fine, I'll eat the squid, but you've got to give the mic to Angel and the others so they can finish.
3093816	3095758	You have to eat the squid before I do that.
3095799	3096840	It looks nasty.
3096860	3097921	You know what it looks like?
3097961	3098942	It looks like Big League Chew.
3110100	3111681	This is horrible radio.
3115184	3116325	This is horrible radio.
3116365	3118047	Give the mic to somebody in the back.
3119949	3120669	Yep, leave.
3121630	3122591	Magus, first game.
3126474	3127876	Words cannot express.
3132339	3135062	Words cannot express what Rob is going through right now.
3137369	3139549	This is bad radio, tell me your first game.
3141790	3143190	Oh, it tastes like burning.
3145111	3146331	Burnination, yes.
3148251	3156233	I'm probably the youngest here, but I still remember playing Kangaroo when I was three, and then moving on to Burger Time when I was five.
3158154	3161754	Then it was Duck Hunt, and then it's all downhill from there.
3164335	3164475	And...
3165911	3168313	Loki, did you get to reminisce about your first video game you remember?
3169174	3170094	No, I didn't.
3170855	3179922	Let's see, the first game I remember... I don't know, I just had like 70 games on the ColecoVision, so I used to play them all.
3179982	3184986	I used to have this one that was Bumba Jump, that's one of my favorites.
3185346	3187407	There is this other one, what was it?
3188769	3190450	Frenzy, I used to like Frenzy.
3191891	3192812	Tester's Revenge?
3193252	3193352	Um...
3194733	3213303	Let's see, um, Smurfs, I used to love the Smurfs game, because that was easy, and I used to make, I used to love to make the Smurfs fall, because they're stupid, and, um, what else, um, there was this one that, I can't remember.
3213323	3215043	I have a Tragball.
3215063	3219146	But, but yeah, pretty much, pretty much just, uh, Frenzy was cool.
3219566	3221867	Oh, ooh, ooh, Jumpman.
3222687	3223668	I love Jumpman.
3224568	3225689	Jumpman was awesome.
3227391	3228071	So, Rob?
3228532	3228772	Yes?
3229933	3235357	Now that you've had squid, do you feel like... Okay, I'm going to share this real fast, and we're going to get into the FUs of the week.
3236418	3238120	I've had, what is it, calamari?
3239161	3240542	I love calamari, it's good.
3240742	3241623	That, not good.
3242624	3244265	That's like beef jerky, but it's squid.
3244465	3249569	How can you, I'm just watching Maren, and she's just like, nope, nope, she's just eating it, mmm, this is good shit.
3249589	3250090	It's nasty!
3250130	3251091	It's nasty!
3252428	3255651	Mmm, beefy, but more like squiddy.
3258493	3261395	I'm expecting it to like explode in my mouth or something.
3261475	3265418	Anyway, I'm glad nobody caught that.
3267760	3274185	Alright, let's settle down children because it's time for Jamie to burninate with the FUs of the week.
3277327	3279789	But the soul still burninates.
3281078	3282739	My mouth is full of squid.
3283019	3283919	Alright, you ready, Jamie?
3284319	3284539	No.
3285400	3289761	Since it's our season premiere, we should remind the listeners what the FUs of the week are all about.
3290562	3293383	It's where we take all the shit that pisses us off and say, fuck you.
3294023	3294303	Okay.
3294683	3295264	How was that?
3295644	3300866	The chat room is begging and pleading us to keep it under control this week and not go on for an hour, so...
3303470	3305972	So, let's try and regulate ourselves, boys and girls.
3306052	3309794	If you hesitate, if you hesitate too much on your FUs, the mic goes on the next person.
3310074	3310334	Agreed?
3310474	3310734	Alright.
3311115	3311475	Here we go.
3312375	3312756	Here we go.
3329246	3331287	Um, my thank you of the week goes to Rob.
3332119	3339125	for parking really shitty and me having to squeeze my perfectly turning radius-ish car around to get in.
3340146	3342067	My car has this killer turning radius.
3342828	3345230	Another fuck you that we give to Julie's car for stinking.
3345910	3348893	It would make you more proud to know that I was talking on my cell phone when I parked.
3351255	3356279	Another fuck you gives to Julie's car for smelling like dust and rotten milk and for having no working air conditioning.
3357239	3358821	Or a radio that lets us change the station.
3359815	3360556	Or a rearview mirror.
3360816	3361657	So I had a rearview mirror.
3361717	3362497	It was a side mirror.
3362958	3363338	Side mirror.
3363878	3365199	The passenger side side mirror.
3366100	3368522	Thank you goes toward getting lost in San Francisco.
3368542	3371945	Actually, just toward the whole street system in San Francisco.
3373206	3379071	And then toward, like, you know, not being able to get Final Fantasy X-2 at Network Video.
3380052	3384095	And also toward the city of Milpitas for being weird.
3384591	3391116	for having like one entrance off of 101 and another one off of 680 and having me turn around and have a snap.
3392276	3396860	And then another one goes toward, um, stuff.
3397360	3397680	The end.
3399481	3401143	And another, that's my hiccup.
3402944	3404205	They're burpy hiccups, they hurt.
3404665	3405546	Ew, are you burping?
3407947	3408468	Alright.
3409789	3410269	That's it then?
3413108	3420759	Triscuit for giving you the phantom taste of cheese, but not really being cheese
3427276	3451507	Alright, starting with this weekend, uh, or last weekend, um, fuck you to San Francisco, I hate you and your stupid town, it smells like ass, and they have birds that shit on my head, and I don't like that, and, um, the fact that you pretty much, I hate Pier 39, Pier 39 is a waste of time, it's just like expensive shit, and how many stores do you really need of souvenirs for San Francisco?
3452087	3455169	I can go to any store there and buy the same shit, it really sucks.
3455809	3463933	So, after that, after you do my freaking cold, because, you know, I hate being sick, and all I smell is snot.
3464013	3466974	I've smelled snot for about four days now, and that's all I smell.
3466994	3469135	It's like this nasty ammonia smell.
3469715	3472717	All day long, that's all I smell is goddamn snot.
3473217	3473677	Okay?
3474517	3481901	After you do this stupid British chick that's performing up on the, like, uh... On the water stage, whatever that stupid stage was there...
3484611	3506234	She was freaking stupid, her and her like gypsy child, I mean, freaking doing these acts up there, and people just didn't give a shit, they're just sitting there going, okay, what's the next thing on, what's the next thing on, and then people are yelling for her to get off the stage, and she's like, oh, how do you like, oh, kids, you know, clap your whistle, and it's just, it was annoying, it was god awful.
3507916	3521982	F you to the refrigerator for having a stupid plug in the bottom there and water being there and I didn't know what the plug was for so I didn't want the water in the refrigerator so I pulled the plug not thinking that the plug doesn't go anywhere except down to the floor.
3522614	3527077	and so now the floor's flooded with water from the stupid refrigerator and that sucks.
3528018	3531640	Um, F you to B3 for not giving me a freaking badge.
3532000	3535783	I mean, goddammit, I fucking set up a bunch of shit for you guys.
3536163	3540166	Like, the whole, like, you know, feed for that stupid camera and all that shit.
3540206	3541707	I got the damn Cat5 cable.
3541787	3546630	I had to spend my own goddamn money to buy 50 feet of Cat5 I'm never gonna ever use again.
3547430	3549692	And, goddammit, you couldn't even give me a fucking badge?
3550032	3551173	What is wrong with you people?
3551873	3580505	and seriously, and after that, oh, give me a free t-shirt, yeah, sure, I really saw that one, I had to go buy my goddamn t-shirt, I don't give a shit, whatever, so, that was awful, I had to carry my goddamn stuff two blocks to your goddamn freaking arcade, which sucked, because that overpriced shit, all your games sucked, your stupid time crisis games sucked, your stupid fucking, um, god, I can't remember, it's some stupid gun game that the goddamn thing wasn't calibrated, right, I'm firing off the screen and saying dead center,
3581939	3585882	That was, uh... Yeah, House of the Dead, because I wanted to play that.
3585982	3587703	Yeah, House of the Dead fucking sucks.
3587823	3589804	By the way, though, your initial game machine was the shit.
3591325	3593246	Yeah, but everything else was shit, okay?
3593446	3597449	What was that goddamn huge... The rollercoaster machine was the shit.
3598769	3599610	And what the hell is that?
3599630	3604393	We're having, like, a stupid shooting range right next to where we're freaking performing for freaking DDR.
3604693	3605774	So every now and then you hear this...
3607723	3609586	And people are like, what the hell is that screaming noise?
3610027	3610548	That sucks.
3611469	3616657	And finally, the biggest one of them all, the biggest FD of the week, is going to PayPal.
3617458	3621003	PayPal overcharged my account by 600 fucking dollars.
3621747	3624029	Okay, beware of PayPal.
3624410	3626972	I wanted to pay for an auction that was $5.99 plus $4.25 shipping for a grand total of $10.24.
3627012	3627373	What did I get?
3627393	3627753	I had it.
3627773	3630436	It instead charged me $599 and $4.25 shipping for a grand total of $6.03.25.
3642298	3656389	There's nothing that PayPal can do, so I had to end up contacting my guy, which made my account overdraft, which also caused a bunch of my other auctions to, you know, overdraft my account even more, so now I have to pay finance charges of about $180.
3656529	3660132	Plus, I had to come up with rent money.
3660732	3663795	So I had to sell off my DVD collection to fix that.
3664535	3666957	Thank you, PayPal, for ruining my whole fucking week.
3668638	3668938	The end.
3670960	3672141	Wow, how can I follow that?
3674889	3679912	Let's see, my FU of the week goes to being sick on a weekend.
3680253	3682094	Being sick on a weekday, that's okay.
3682874	3683394	That's okay.
3683415	3687237	My FU goes to Loki for giving me SARS in the first place because he was sick and now I'm sick.
3689038	3692280	And the thing is, if you're sick on a weekday, that's cool because you can miss work.
3692740	3700585	But being sick on a weekend, that just sucks because now you have to work and you have to waste your weekend lying in bed going, I hate my life and I want to die.
3701826	3702026	But...
3702938	3704339	I do have a good point out of all this.
3704559	3708021	Coldies, whoever invented coldies, pure fucking genius.
3708302	3711704	I'm already on the other end of my cold and I was never like super duper ill.
3711964	3714826	Coldies are the bomb and I recommend everybody take them.
3715126	3720329	You should have been listening to me from day one because I've always told you just take zinc and vitamin C and you'll feel better.
3720369	3721750	That's exactly what's in that shit.
3722090	3725332	Yeah, I know.
3725633	3728975	But it's called coldies and it tastes like cherries.
3733114	3734334	No, they do taste like butt.
3734394	3734835	I'll agree.
3735075	3738777	It tastes like the shitty rear end of a SARS victim.
3740118	3741879	Yeah, F you to the taste of coldies.
3742019	3742579	That's awful.
3744280	3746882	Alright, let's move on to the other folks in the room.
3747002	3748503	Starting off with Marin.
3749586	3755553	I would like to say F you to my car, since the alternator exploded or something and we had to replace it.
3756154	3760779	F you to McCarran International Airport for making me take off my shoes so they could x-ray them.
3761820	3765825	And F you to guys who step on your feet and do not apologize and are rude.
3766766	3767426	And that's about it.
3767687	3768708	Other than that, it was a good week.
3769406	3774169	Yeah, and then guys who step on your feet and smell bad and can't work the soft-serve ice cream machine.
3774189	3775330	So, yeah.
3775951	3776591	So insensitive.
3777512	3778272	Uh, let's move on.
3778332	3780214	I'm gonna move on and get Brad to go here.
3782095	3782515	Here.
3782656	3784457	Is this my song?
3784477	3786358	You always give me this.
3786418	3788019	It's a different song every week.
3788059	3788480	Okay, anyway.
3788500	3797526	I don't know if he goes to Sailors, because, um, I mean, I love Irene's dad and all, but, uh, he wanted to play, he's from, he was in the Navy, you know, he's retired.
3797566	3797646	He...
3799142	3804005	He played, we had to do a drinking game, sailor style, like sailor rules.
3804085	3807127	And you had 60 seconds to drink your shot.
3807287	3809148	And we went in a round of three people.
3809508	3814351	And I probably had somewhere around 11 or 12 shots of rum last night.
3814371	3816692	And I didn't get sobered up until about 2 p.m.
3816712	3817052	today.
3818253	3820875	So, sailor style.
3823716	3823976	Yes.
3824817	3825357	Dead air.
3825377	3826038	I'm sorry.
3827138	3827478	Mike.
3828999	3830059	Okay, okay, my F.U.
3830079	3834940	goes to not having that stupid DWI finish I wanted on the Season 3 premiere.
3836380	3837861	I was hoping to have it finished by then.
3839601	3843882	And F. not being able to sleep, because I had nowhere to sleep, but that was probably my fault.
3843902	3845102	So, yeah, F.U.
3845142	3845822	to myself.
3847782	3849703	Okay.
3849923	3850243	Angel!
3850683	3852423	Uh, I'd like to say F.U.
3852443	3854923	to my boss again, because he almost didn't give me the weekend off.
3855724	3855924	Ow.
3856624	3857504	I gave him that flash.
3860415	3861196	I feel the flash.
3861216	3862337	Yeah, okay.
3865600	3867041	Yeah, so I almost didn't get to come here.
3867201	3867441	See?
3867581	3868242	That wasn't good.
3868642	3869563	So, FU to that.
3871105	3872586	Alright, moving on to Magus.
3873227	3878071	Yeah, first of all, FU to the Sacramento RT bus system.
3878752	3880814	They don't know how to run their buses around Arden.
3881314	3884157	We were trying to get from my high school...
3885057	3888739	to Arden Fur Mall to go see, like, Matrix 3 Loads and stuff.
3889959	3897543	Apparently, we make it to the light rail station and, well, the bus doesn't show for an hour and a half.
3898503	3906687	So we took the long walk from Arden Fulton to the mall in the burning heat.
3908207	3910728	Second of all, yes, yes.
3910808	3913469	Make sure you want to fly the McViper.
3913489	3913530	Uh...
3915316	3917617	Second of all, F you to traffic on Thursday.
3917957	3918577	What the hell?
3918917	3923418	We leave on Thursday right before Memorial Day weekend.
3923658	3925219	We expect no one to be on the road.
3925579	3927960	We're an hour and a half late coming into the Bay Area.
3929820	3931501	Fuck those stupid drivers.
3932101	3934581	When again, we were one of the stupid drivers.
3936102	3936382	Next.
3938843	3943304	F you to Chinese food places that play Outbreak while you're trying to eat.
3945134	3945954	That's kind of funny.
3946794	3948055	I don't know if I give an FU, that's funny.
3948315	3950875	A Chinese movie plays, it plays Outbreak, the movie Outbreak.
3950895	3954156	It happened to be, it happened to be Silver Garden, thank you very much.
3955737	3958037	Uh, does Navi have any FUs of the week?
3958697	3958877	No.
3960298	3961438	Somebody, somebody's nice.
3963118	3964839	Somebody's in a happy mood and has no FUs of the week.
3969713	3971334	He says he forgot them because they were fucked up.
3972135	3974937	Alright, so that's it for the studio FUs of the week.
3975117	3975617	Hey, not bad.
3975657	3976818	Oh wait, does Nelly have anything?
3979100	3980221	Okay, oh, she's not that bitter.
3980281	3980521	Okay.
3985625	3987846	Okay, let's move on to the chatroom FUs then.
3988046	3988727	Hey, not bad you guys.
3988747	3990148	It only took 20 minutes to get through ours.
3991089	3991849	Usually it takes an hour.
3993430	3994131	Okay, Mandarin.
3994751	3995332	Mandarin.
3997084	4020541	Fuck the Orange Lounge radio hosts that don't wish me a happy birthday Fuck stupid managers at Yardbirds that make my girlfriend work on my birthday Fuck real radio stations like 94.9 who overplayed this song Let's see, fuck people who say fuck too fucking much
4023416	4028921	Fuck my roommate's ex-girlfriend because she's a controlling bitch who won't let my roommate be gay.
4029201	4030642	Or at least trying as hard as she can.
4031663	4032243	Don't be gay.
4032724	4033484	Don't be gay, Sparky.
4033524	4033985	Don't be gay.
4035726	4036006	Alright.
4037047	4037528	Moving on.
4039009	4044433	Justin B would like to say F you to Rob and Jamie at the beginning of the show when Jamie was coughing up her lungs.
4044853	4049237	Because the comment you made and Jamie coughing made me spit soda slash hot dog out of my mouth.
4054204	4056066	And now we just had a laugh at your expense.
4058047	4058968	That was the win.
4061230	4061850	Keep going.
4062551	4066975	Ninst would like to say, F56K Connections who keep buffering Orange Lounge Radio.
4068172	4087664	Stupid kids who think they can play DDR when they can't pass beginner songs Moving out at the end of the college year My professor from my coding class, he didn't show up with a final until an hour after he should have One more time, my modem and being a 56k connection People who decide to take slow drives on country roads on Sundays You drive too slow and keep other people from where they need to be
4088590	4092973	People who don't like Matrix Reloaded, they had to think somewhat, because they had to think somewhat.
4093633	4096435	And to close it off, my 56k connection to my ISP should die.
4096635	4097215	Oh, one more.
4097675	4101738	F you to my brother's roommate, you are the laziest bastard I've ever seen, and F you to Radio Shack.
4101998	4103318	They overcharge on everything.
4103599	4106260	Why can't there be a decent electronics shop around here?
4106380	4107081	That was two more.
4107101	4109362	Yeah, that was like two or three more.
4110086	4111567	God, everybody's got a marathon today.
4111907	4115249	Okay, DJ Tyrant would like to say, FUs to the internet connection I'm on.
4115649	4118471	Fox for not yet releasing 24 Season 2 on DVD.
4118651	4119671	They will this summer, you know it.
4120432	4123433	Women for only wanting to be my friend and nothing more.

4139827	4140868	FU to Spice World.
4144789	4149671	And Black Lab would like to say, FUs, fuck horrible sleep cycles, fuck boredom and laziness.
4150172	4153213	I spent about 90% of this weekend thus far sitting at my computer.
4153293	4153853	Fuck the heat.
4154233	4157154	Riding a bike across town in 95 degree heat is not fun.
4157775	4163517	Fuck the holiday for keeping the dining halls closed an extra day so I can't eat a decent meal a day longer than usual.
4164727	4165009	DarkSakura.com
4169420	4170981	All right.
4171962	4172662	Moving on.

4178246	4179748	Discreet error, discreet error.
4179768	4184831	I'm so freaking tired of turning my PlayStation 2 upside down and spinning it all around to get it to read the disc.
4185272	4196520	Also F you to server ops to take their job way too seriously and let nothing go by and then lying about giving warnings and thus ban someone without them realizing what they were doing was wrong despite of how insignificant the problem was.
4200421	4202142	Vandalus would like to say an F you.
4203463	4206245	F you to my Cadillac for having a leaky radiator.

4217873	4220395	Now the window of that door won't go down all the way anymore.
4220535	4221776	Fucking hit and run bitches.
4224511	4239182	and lastly, Muheimer would like to say, fuck me for not being here and submitting late, fuck not having the internet for two weeks because of McGathey Firewall, fuck homophobes, but yay for 50 cent DDR extreme 10 minutes away finally, oh, and thank God for acupuncture curing my allergies.
4239882	4240323	Allergies.
4242344	4244085	Hooray, that's everybody's FU of the week.
4246567	4249689	So, any last bits of bitterness?
4251331	4251671	Loki,
4252654	4255696	You have something new that's going to be coming to the show that I see you just got.
4255876	4258137	Do you want to share with our listeners what you just won?
4259918	4265601	Yeah, I actually found this when I was looking for Dansense Revolution stuff.
4265761	4270724	You know, normally I look for the arcade discs and stuff, and this just happened to be pulled up in an eBay auction.
4271465	4276047	So, I won a hentai cosplay.
4276107	4280710	Actually, it's a cosplay porn featuring DDR characters.
4284702	4287083	So yes, we have DDR porn.
4288544	4289765	Will we get to play that on the show?
4291306	4291686	Of course.
4291966	4292306	Yay!
4293227	4293727	Oh, yay.
4295288	4296368	Don't sound too excited, Jamie.
4296728	4298249	No, I'm actually kind of curious.
4298569	4300070	Is it going to be like Final Fuck X?
4300491	4302992	I hope it's not all blurred out and shit.
4304092	4306354	Will there be pantsless rage?
4306594	4310636	It'll be just like Final Fuck X. Where did my afghan go?
4312554	4313214	That's what I'm curious.
4313554	4314155	It's like disappeared.
4314235	4314715	Oh, there it is.
4316616	4317856	It ran away from all the people.
4320317	4324979	By the way, I like these chairs because I can sit really, you know, sideways in them.
4327820	4329940	Okay, we're going to take a quick break.
4330481	4332802	And we're going to come back and do the cage match in a little bit.
4333442	4338564	But first we're going to hear some Kylie from the Euro Mega Mix.
4339224	4341745	And then we'll hear something from Poppin' Music.
4344291	4346156	and last message because Jamie wants to hear it.
4346236	4348221	So we'll be right back, boys and girls.
4348262	4349705	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
4383558	4387881	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
4423716	4429259	I wish to the arrest of your foe, may he make your message a thousand times
4485419	4486680	Thank you for watching!
4513254	4513875	Thanks for watching!
4709458	4710679	Orange Lounge Radio.
4711019	4713181	We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
4715082	4721266	Hello, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
4722627	4731332	And we're just a few minutes... We're just a few minutes out from this season three's very first cage match, which should be an exciting one.
4731352	4734174	I've seen all the songs, and I think... I picked Crab.
4734574	4736896	I think... No, actually, your pick is pretty... Well, we'll see...
4737822	4739863	You'll see what the songs are going to be in a little bit.
4741545	4743486	But they're all pretty good.
4743526	4745647	I know which songs, I've heard all these songs, they're all pretty good.
4745667	4747709	They're all the kind of music that our chat room seems to like.
4747789	4751251	So those of you that yell at us for picking crap, I have nothing to complain about this week.
4751411	4752392	They said it picks show tunes.
4756207	4758249	Masquerade, Paper Faces, I'm very... Okay, wait.
4759430	4763813	I thought I'd open the floor up for story time because I know a lot of people had stories they wanted to tell tonight.
4763893	4766656	So, Jamie, will you want to kick it off?
4766676	4770859	Why don't you tell us about how you've been burninating this weekend with Marin.
4771119	4772100	Or does Marin want to tell the story?
4772140	4772400	I don't know.
4774462	4777184	It starts off with me at work at 5.30 in the morning.
4778085	4779186	Do I need story time music?
4779206	4780347	Do you want story time music?
4780367	4780587	Sure.
4780607	4781728	It's Sal-kun.
4784569	4789713	Oh, yeah, I have to play the music that came to us from the Hamster Alliance.
4789853	4791374	Because Loki liked it.
4791534	4792675	Which, I don't remember which one it is.
4793375	4794115	I think it's this one.
4797378	4797598	Okay.
4798158	4799359	Rob, do you have any cookies?
4800360	4800780	Do I have what?
4800820	4801901	I need cookies to tell a story.
4803822	4804522	Just tell your story.
4807444	4810726	I get off work, and I go right over to Jessica's house.
4812427	4812988	And there's...
4814483	4819785	Somebody waiting for me there, sitting on the couch, which is still set up theater-style seating for watching movies on the wall.
4821206	4826008	So, we went, and what did we do?
4826048	4827769	We went out to South Sac for boba.
4828789	4830410	Then we went to Roseville for sushi.
4831771	4835412	Then we went back to my house and decided to watch Battle Royale.
4837533	4840795	I got my Battle Royale manga first because we went to A1 Comics.
4842339	4846161	and then we watched Battle Royale and your impression?
4848542	4850423	Battle Royale was interesting.
4850563	4858487	I think it would have been better if Dan wasn't doing, you know, director's commentary during the last half of it, but it was pretty interesting.
4858907	4859448	Moving on.
4859468	4860148	Paper plate!
4860228	4860608	Okay.
4870666	4873467	This joke ends right now, okay?
4878707	4880348	The plate has been retired.
4880788	4881908	I have a new weapon.
4882268	4883828	It's called the smell of pussy.
4888889	4889509	Or squid.
4890109	4891130	Janae, put your pants on.
4894050	4895370	Okay, anyway.
4896751	4898691	So, and we ended up crashing out.
4899947	4908252	Next day, we wake up at, well at least I woke up at the ass crack of dawn, you know like 8.30 in the morning, and you were still asleep.
4910633	4917977	So I went back to bed, got up around 9.30, we bummed around, and then tried to get out of the door, but I kept forgetting stuff.
4918783	4923504	And so we finally get in Julie's, you know, car that smells like, you know, granny panties.
4925545	4927905	You know, the smell of dust and rotten milk.
4932246	4938568	And so we had a really nice drive going into San Francisco and then I got lost because I forgot to turn on Van Ness.
4941059	4945101	and do some direction and just some random turning.
4945141	4947382	We make it, you know, to Giri and get there.
4947903	4949584	Go shopping, have good food.
4951464	4954966	I almost bought SARS masks, but sided against it.
4955907	4962910	And then we managed to get to a network video with no problem, except for the guy behind me who wanted to kill me.
4964151	4965512	This guy had this big vehicle.
4965592	4967313	I swear he was like the worst driver in the world.
4968133	4968613	But anyway...
4970802	4977474	So the next thing, we get on the 101 South again to go to...
4978849	4983911	to network, and it turns out he gave us directions to Sunnyvale, because we were trying to get to Milpitas instead.
4984551	4997196	So, I got directions from, um, from Shark's Girl, from my Waikipoo, and we, uh, managed to get to Milpitas Golf Land, race Delete Horses, and then we came back and said, hey, we want some boba.
4997216	5001878	So we went to Davis, got... What the fuck is this music?
5002559	5003539	It's story time music!
5004039	5005440	Okay, this music needs to go away.
5005460	5006040	Okay.
5007379	5009101	It's okay, but it doesn't fit my story.
5009121	5010062	Do you want the violins again?
5012825	5014286	This is some burninating music.
5016766	5019747	Okay.
5020787	5026589	Then we got back to my place, and we were going to have pizza, but we sort of just didn't make it.
5027629	5037212	We watched, we played some Soul Calibur 2, and I got my ass handed to me repeatedly every time Marin picked Taki.
5038092	5042573	Of course, it turned out that I was like super cheap with, who was I super cheap with?
5045026	5045947	I'm always cheap.
5046167	5047228	No, it was Seungmino.
5047248	5048949	When I pulled out Seungmino instead of Kilik.
5049549	5050229	I was really cheap.
5050330	5051530	And with Yunsung.
5051550	5054532	I sucked with Link.
5054732	5057194	Then we watched some Shaman King, but she fell asleep.
5057834	5059235	I was like, wake up!
5059275	5060816	Go upstairs, go stand with the couch.
5063731	5066913	So she goes to sleep, and I'm playing Ragnarok until 1.30 in the morning.
5067613	5068313	And then the end.
5068473	5073375	And then there's today, where we just, like, sat around the house, like, most of the morning.
5075276	5077417	And then, um, what else happened?
5078418	5084100	We went to the mall, went to Fresh Choice, where the stupid man was, who smelled funny, and stuck on my foot.
5084921	5090183	And then we, um, we went to see Rob, not Rob, we went to see Dan at work.
5091243	5092824	Some man's just mumbling in the background.
5094133	5122682	mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble
5123524	5124644	Tell us about Trogdor.
5126645	5128206	Trogdor is a man.
5130127	5131607	Trogdor is a horseman.
5132527	5133908	Well, really, he's just a horse.
5134668	5136009	But still, he's Trogdor.
5139330	5140771	That's just kind of jazz!
5140971	5141231	Okay.
5142231	5142731	Alright.
5143752	5146353	Anybody else have something they want to share for Orange Lounge Storytime?
5146693	5148173	I know that they did over there.
5150374	5150714	What?
5151115	5151415	What?
5152035	5152275	What?
5152571	5154052	First of all, I have pie.
5155272	5157073	You don't have cake pie, you have apple pie.
5157893	5158634	I still have pie.
5159434	5159794	Whatever.
5161075	5161475	Music.
5161655	5162335	You've got music.
5162455	5164256	Get some Chinese music or something.
5164396	5165777	I didn't mean that in a bad way, but yeah.
5166597	5167558	Just tell your damn story.
5169919	5171059	It's the Silver Garden thing.
5171799	5172140	I know.
5172180	5173680	And I think I pretty much said it.
5174981	5176782	Oh, because of the outbreak thing they were playing?
5176802	5176942	Yeah.
5177002	5178182	Well, then why did you raise your hand?
5178782	5179423	I don't know.
5180606	5186569	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5205429	5207030	Uh, I've asked another to the Exxon.
5207590	5207890	Woo!
5208070	5208170	Yay!
5208230	5208531	Which one?
5208891	5210351	Uh, Foundation something.
5211312	5213193	It's a, yeah, Foundation of Our Love, sorry.
5214273	5214773	Uh, Magus?
5217794	5218195	One word.
5218735	5219075	Bad!
5221336	5222777	I thought you were going to say Shades, damn it.
5223677	5230460	Um, my Bomani accomplishment this week is the fact that there's the remix contest going on over on Bomani Style.
5231201	5233705	and I can't play DWR.
5233725	5233945	DWR.
5234666	5236609	Can't play Sub Mania and talk at the same time.
5236649	5240615	Anyways, there's a competition going on over at BomaniStyle.com.
5240655	5241917	It's a remix contest.
5242658	5243819	And both entries...

5284372	5286854	No, but really, go there and listen to all the remixes.
5286874	5289796	There's a lot of them that really suck, but then there's some that are really good.
5290956	5294058	You'll know pretty much by looking at it which ones are pretty good.
5294238	5298461	There's one DJ Demon, I believe, did Max Resurrection.
5298481	5299701	We played that a while back.
5300082	5302683	It's pretty good, but I still want to win.
5305185	5311969	So go vote 10 for mine, because there's just not enough people voting on mine, and I need people to go vote 10, just because.
5312689	5314951	And then don't just vote a 10, vote everyone else a 1.
5315272	5316153	No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
5316393	5322178	But post in the thread and talk about how beautiful Loki's remixes are and how his remixes make you want to fuck him.
5325261	5329285	Just kidding, Nelly.
5333069	5334050	Yeah, you can want.
5335511	5336873	It's nice to want.
5337660	5339621	But, yeah, there's some pretty good ones.
5340241	5345423	The one I like, though, there's a really good Paranoia remix in there that's a hip-hop remix of Paranoia.
5345964	5348685	And maybe we'll get to play that later on in the show, that's pretty good.
5349345	5352486	There's a Ghosts one that's kind of a piano-ambient one that's pretty good.
5353107	5356448	There's a So Deep one that's a piano-ambient one that's pretty good.
5357308	5365852	There's a long version, like a trancy remix, well, a longer trance remix of So Deep that's, yeah, it's alright.
5366747	5369691	But yeah, pretty much the Paranoia one, really good.
5370151	5371833	I mean, that one deserves a 10 also.
5372814	5375037	Also, the SoDeep one is pretty good.
5375057	5376519	The analog mix is pretty good.
5377340	5378762	But yes, vote a 1 for everyone else.
5381127	5384928	I have a few remixes that I'd name that deserve ones, but I'm not going to name them on the air.
5385148	5386808	Whistle song.
5389469	5392110	Anyway, let's get on with the cage match, shall we?
5392290	5395891	I think our chat room's been kind of a little eager for this, and I am too.
5395991	5397891	I'm moist with anticipation about this.
5397971	5406213	So, last week, or two weeks ago, I should say, in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage match, I got you, I got you, Loki.
5407474	5408054	Remix out.
5409232	5410233	DJ Tyrant fucks Loki
5429497	5435742	Anyway, as I was saying, last week in the cage match, Loki's pick won with this.
5435802	5443707	Oh, by the way, the way the cage match works, all the hosts, the three of us, myself, Loki, DarkSakura, we all pick one song, and they all fight each other per your votes.
5443887	5445529	So you vote for the song you like best.
5446609	5465130	and you send those votes over to Sky in the chat room but you can't vote until all three songs have played and then the song with the most votes goes into rotation on Orange Lounge Radio until the next cage match so here was last week's winner and the first song you can vote for tonight it's Don Davis and Juno Reactor with Mona Lisa Overdrive from the movie The Matrix Reloaded enjoy
5553067	5555269	Alright, that's the first song you can vote for this week.
5555289	5560434	That's Mona Lisa Overdrive here in the Cajun Match.
5560654	5563157	Matrix Reloaded, very good scene in that movie, by the way.
5563177	5564378	That was from the freeway chase scene.
5564838	5569403	Alright, second song is going to be DarkSakura's pick, so why don't you tell us all about it?
5570243	5571425	I don't even know if it's named right.
5571465	5573466	It says it's from Final Fantasy X, but I don't think so.
5574187	5575729	It's just some cool song.
5575769	5576810	I don't even remember the name of it.
5577458	5578419	Alright, I'll name it for you.
5578459	5584265	It's called Set Me Free and it's labeled by Final Fantasy X, but Jamie can't seem to place this.
5585226	5588749	And it says it's remixed by Paul Oakenfold, so we'll see.
5589670	5590831	I highly doubt that.
5590931	5593774	Yeah, I doubt it too, but I did think the music was cool.
5593854	5595716	It's just how it was labeled when I downloaded it.
5596818	5603002	So we're just going to refer to this as Set Me Free because that's the only part of this song name that we think is correct.
5603842	5604323	So enjoy.
5604983	5608425	You only heard a clip of the last song because it won last time.
5608485	5609466	So you only get to hear a clip.
5609646	5610787	You get to hear the full one of this.
5610827	5613308	So this is pick number two for this week.
5613508	5614149	Set Me Free.
5614349	5614589	Enjoy.
5663138	5663959	Thanks for watching!
5689670	5689952	Thank you.
5815541	5819284	All right, that was the first, or I'm sorry, the second song in tonight's cage match.
5819544	5823668	That was Set Me Free, which may or may not be Final Fantasy, and may or may not be Paul Oakenfold.
5823768	5824789	So, go figure.
5825629	5828452	Anybody want to comment on that and give it something on a scale of 1 to 10?
5828752	5829052	Jamie?
5830573	5829052	10.
5832035	5834417	Loki, you have anything you want to say about it?
5834837	5836278	It definitely wasn't Oakenfold.
5836538	5838280	It could have been a lot better than that.
5839301	5840041	It was all right.
5840161	5842583	I couldn't place it anywhere in Final Fantasy at all.
5843855	5845316	It was just kind of average to me.
5845376	5848117	I've heard a lot of, you know, trance techno tracks.
5848137	5848837	It was just average.
5849398	5850338	So I'd give it a seven.
5851939	5858422	Yeah, I mean, it's very trance in the fact that I see it as kind of like background music, but it's nothing I'd kind of be all, ooh, I've got to listen to this song.
5858442	5859182	Oh, my God, I love this song.
5859202	5863244	But, like, you know, if it was planned, I'd be, okay, yeah, I'd just kind of, you know, bob my head like the Roxbury guys.
5863264	5864805	So, you know, I'd give it a seven and a half.
5864965	5865165	Cool.
5865945	5867606	Anybody else want to comment on Set Me Free?
5870608	5871048	DarkSakura?
5872338	5872978	Oh, I liked it.
5873038	5876541	It would probably make good background music for, like, First Man Net or something.
5876861	5877882	Uh, seven and a half.
5878442	5878742	Uh-huh.
5879142	5880983	Anybody over here in this corner want to comment on Set Me Free?
5881264	5881524	Anybody?
5881844	5882324	Anybody, anybody?
5882404	5883645	It was okay, but, uh... You good?
5883665	5883765	Yeah.
5883785	5886987	Um, I don't know, do you want me to rate it?
5887187	5887488	Yeah.
5888248	5890009	Um, no?
5890970	5891790	Okay, I won't.
5892090	5892931	No, you have to rate it.
5894852	5896213	I've been denied or something.
5896273	5897394	Okay, um, seven.
5898675	5898955	All right.
5899515	5900676	So, any, oh, Magus?
5901365	5907209	Very trancy, really good like working music if you're like working on some like platform or anything like that.
5907229	5907990	I'd probably give it an 8.
5908670	5909911	It's good burninating music.
5909991	5910312	Yeah.
5910732	5911973	Oh, hacking or burninating.
5911993	5912653	Yeah, there we go.
5913614	5915335	That's good music for decorating cakes too.
5915816	5916256	Yeah.
5917057	5919959	I like that.
5920199	5921760	Some cake decorating music.
5921980	5922481	I like that.
5923001	5923982	I like driving to it.
5924082	5924802	Okay.
5925003	5926284	Any other comments on Set Me Free?
5926824	5927364	Anybody, anybody?
5927665	5928946	You could be influencing the votes.
5929686	5930667	Oh, we have a hand.
5931750	5933692	Good music to refurbish cabinets to.
5935934	5936355	Okay.
5937816	5938677	Alright, moving on.
5939718	5942941	The third and final song in tonight's cage match is my pick.
5943462	5947746	And I decided to go the slutty route and I picked a former porno star.
5949568	5950709	I picked Tracy Lords.
5951469	5952750	Did I call it or did I?
5952930	5955532	And this song is kind of, it's a couple years old.
5955872	5958554	And a lot of people know this song from the Mortal Kombat soundtrack.
5958574	5959435	It's called Control.
5959775	5961756	But this is the version that has the vocals in it.
5961796	5963117	So you can be really slutty.
5963557	5967280	So everybody get naked because this is the song to have some sex to.
5967940	5970142	This is my pick for this week's cage match.
5970202	5971583	It's Tracy Lords with Control.
5984182	5984982	Thanks for watching!
6183402	6187463	Alright, that was Tracy Lords with Control, so let's get thoughts and reaction on that one.
6187483	6187783	Jamie?
6189064	6194385	It's cool, but I've had that version for a long time myself, so for me it's kind of old.
6195286	6199107	It still doesn't mean it's unless it's a good song, I'd give it probably a 7.5.
6199727	6201928	Alright, anybody else want to comment on Control?
6206909	6212571	I love that song because that brings me back to Q's our days, where we used to play with the Mortal Kombat soundtrack all the time.
6213180	6219304	and that movie, while being a really sucky movie overall, it was good at it's time.
6220224	6221085	I like this on U.S.
6222646	6223266	Dark Tetsuya?
6224066	6225007	Oh, this is okay.
6225387	6225888	I'll give it a 7.
6226028	6226908	Okay, Angel?
6228029	6229510	Hey, Mortal Kombat 6A.
6229570	6231451	What was the soundtrack to it?
6231511	6232732	I don't remember.
6233112	6233632	I don't remember.
6233652	6235873	Anyway, okay, um, I'll give it an 8.
6237134	6239135	If you want to rip off someone's head, I'll give it a 7.
6239576	6239956	It's good.
6241221	6246647	Nothing kicks more ass than the World Combat The Game soundtrack.
6248909	6249489	I have that.
6249629	6250170	I had that.
6250510	6253834	I need a copy of that, though.
6253934	6259379	I would agree with Nico Adachi in the chatroom who says it sounds like techno stripper music.
6259599	6259960	Amen.
6260160	6261221	Total stripper music.
6261982	6262863	Yes, another comment?
6263837	6265298	That'd be my cage dance music.
6265599	6267741	Seriously, I love that.
6268121	6268542	I'd give it a 10.
6269322	6271344	So how appropriate for the cage match.
6273687	6274527	That was really bad.
6274547	6275388	Yeah, I know.
6275408	6275989	That joke gets a 2.
6276609	6279592	Anyway, anybody else, any other comments on Tracy Miller's control?
6279612	6279893	Yeah, mine is 2.
6282803	6283043	What?
6283063	6283424	Wait, what?
6283444	6285965	I like her pornography better than her music.
6287186	6288647	I had a really funny one, though.
6288787	6291308	It was, like, I think her first album that she did.
6292069	6296031	Just about, like, this girl who would, like, seduce these guys and then, like, kick her ass.
6299433	6300593	I'll have to find that CD again.
6301854	6304496	Next time for your cage match, pick Carmen Alexa.
6305436	6308238	Please, find some, like, Carmen Alexa and play it.
6309147	6310048	We'll see, we'll see.
6310128	6312069	Alright, you can send in those votes now.
6312109	6314371	You can send those over private message to me in the chatroom.
6314411	6317813	My name is Sky, and you just, if you're not in the chatroom, get your ass in there.
6318013	6321816	www.callybomani.com Click on Orange Lounge, click on chat.
6321876	6324158	Here's a little reminder of the songs you can vote for tonight.
6324538	6326299	Song number one is last week's winner.
6326339	6327760	It's Mona Lisa Overdrive.
6336540	6338502	Song number... That was kind of a crappy part to play, sorry.
6338842	6340343	Song two is Set Me Free.
6349511	6351872	And song number three is Tracy Lord's With Control.
6360600	6362501	Alright, so those are the songs you can vote for.
6362601	6364242	Send those now.
6365447	6367608	Okay, so, that's a cage match.
6368248	6370628	Everybody wake up, cage match is over.
6370848	6373169	Cage match is usually a part of a show where people in the studio fall asleep.
6375129	6379210	I kind of have to pee, but I don't want to pee because we just played a bunch of music, so I don't want to go to break.
6380271	6383251	Loki, what are you... You're disgusting.
6383911	6386032	Loki, why don't you tell us about some of the new vinyl you got this week?
6387412	6389193	I got you some vinyl.
6389373	6392273	I got Prince's 1999, and I got... Where'd it go?
6393854	6394334	And I got
6394895	6396035	I got this other thing.
6396195	6396756	It's over here.
6397356	6399997	Got buried under all my other stuff.
6400697	6402558	I got Desert, Letting Your Mind Go.
6403738	6410520	And I got Baby's Got a Tempa by Prodigy.
6411181	6413041	Ooh, it has an instrumental and acapella mix.
6413061	6413661	You know what that means?
6413962	6414862	I can make a remix!
6415622	6418723	There were those other three from earlier in the week.
6419183	6420244	And I also got...
6422790	6434295	I got Heaven, DJ Sammy of course, Walk Like an Egyptian, and what else did I get?
6434875	6439577	The Human League with... It's Don't You Want Me on the other side.
6439617	6442679	Yeah, it's Don't You Want Me and Love Action.
6444319	6447621	And also, I got Kachigugu, Too Shy.
6449816	6478816	and, um, I've got more stuff coming in, thank you eBay, I've got more stuff coming in, I've got, um, the whole Eddie Murphy album, including his song, uh, I forget what his song's called, but anyways, yeah, it's really funny, and then I've got, um, Frankie Goes Hollywood, Relax, and, um, Two Tribes, I've also got, um, well, let's see here, pull up my list, um,
6480643	6483884	Let's see, I've got... The Reflex.
6485305	6485905	Cool.
6486125	6490286	I've got... Oh shit, I'm trying to remember.
6492227	6494507	Just give me one second.
6495008	6495208	One.
6495228	6497388	God damn it.
6500694	6500954	B.T.
6501254	6507299	Dreamin' Culture Club Starship Knee Deep and Hoopla Ghostbusters Soundtrack
6530931	6532614	First, I need to set up the other turntable.
6533054	6534797	Second, I need to learn how to beatmix.
6535898	6538362	Kind of an important part of the mix show.
6539724	6541006	No, I seriously need to practice.
6541026	6542989	I haven't practiced at all, period.
6543389	6547315	You know, drama and stuff is preventing me from doing so, so, yeah.
6550040	6554821	Okay, um, any other, anybody else gonna start a show on Orange Lounge?
6554841	6556241	Maybe I should start doing a Friday show.
6556501	6556821	You what?
6557101	6558502	Maybe I should start doing a Friday show.
6558802	6563863	I know, I've, uh, I think I'm gonna start, I've tossed the idea around.
6563883	6566743	It's really inconvenient for me to do one during the week, but Fridays I could do a show.
6567043	6573144	Right, well, I mean, don't also tie yourself down, because what you can do, you can pre-tape, like, four in a row, and then play them later.
6573164	6573644	Why would I do that?
6574344	6574725	If you want.
6575005	6576865	That sort of defeats the purpose of me doing a live show.
6577704	6578105	It's up to you.
6578145	6579826	If you want to do a live show, do it.
6580366	6583548	I'm thinking about doing a tape show about remixes and originals.
6584709	6584989	Maybe.
6585169	6586610	I'm kind of toying with that idea.
6586650	6588031	Mine's all random crap anyway.
6588371	6595216	You think maybe this Friday I might do another... If I can get the samples, I might do another video game trivia.
6596857	6598238	You should call it Taberninate.
6598898	6599199	Ha!
6599659	6599859	Ha!
6600119	6600279	Ha!
6600520	6601720	No, I think the Berninate joke.
6601880	6604322	We don't want to run that into the ground.
6604402	6605383	The Berninate jokes...
6606167	6606969	Yes, Dark Tetsuya.
6606989	6608391	You don't have to raise your hand, you're not in school.
6609132	6610094	Well, he has to get a mic, though.
6611056	6611897	We need to get a third mic.
6611917	6615523	Yeah, we need to get Espo back into the chat room so I can get my title back from him.
6618008	6618428	Good point.
6618905	6620006	Get it while he's not there.
6620366	6621126	Get it while he's not there.
6645498	6649379	Yeah, so we're going to get capped on the number of listeners we can have, but don't worry, you guys.
6649459	6650680	You'll still be able to get through.
6651300	6653781	If we have to raise the bar by paying a little more, we will.
6653841	6654181	Whatever.
6654521	6655041	We'll deal with it.
6655581	6656782	But I'm pretty sure we're going to be safe for now.
6656842	6659703	But we get more space, so we can add way more songs to our playlist.
6660143	6671467	So we could do, like, specialized Guitar Freaks playlist, specialized 2DX and Papa Music playlist, which is an idea being tossed around, because we can use our nifty little auto-scheduler and bring some more variety to the day.
6672691	6675933	So we hope you're listening to Orange Launch Radio all day long because, you know, we play good music.
6676194	6676494	Damn it.
6679316	6679496	Huh?
6680737	6682658	Okay, so we're going to go to break now so I can pee.
6684019	6685480	And tally the votes for Cage Match.
6685801	6687222	Magus, your vote doesn't count because you're here.
6688383	6688703	Sorry.
6690124	6692045	I just see your name in red and I already know.
6692306	6692606	Sorry.
6694047	6695408	Jamie, any requests for this break?
6696769	6701072	Let's go with Little Red Corvette.
6701598	6704159	You want to hear Little Red... What does Little Red Corvette have to do with Balani?
6704319	6704819	I don't care.
6705119	6705699	It's Prince.
6707740	6708540	You're... Okay.
6710021	6711001	No, I'm not reading that.
6712422	6715903	Um, why don't we go with, um, some Keyboard Mania stuff?
6716043	6717023	Okay, some Keyboard Mania.
6717043	6718104	Let's go with Loose 100 Seconds.
6718844	6719964	Okay, I can do that.
6720564	6721765	Um... Let's go with Klunk Klunk.
6722845	6723525	Hold on, hold on.
6723545	6724406	Getting him, getting him, getting him.
6725386	6725466	Uh...
6728387	6729887	We're going to hear Klunkang.
6730107	6731768	We'll hear Least 100 Seconds.
6731788	6732488	Vitalize.
6733108	6733288	Huh?
6733428	6733908	Vitalize?
6735589	6737529	Vitalize, I think I have filed under Guitar Freaks.
6737669	6738710	Okay, we'll do Vitalize.
6739190	6740890	And I want to throw in a song for Janae.
6742611	6744191	I'm going to throw in a song just for you, Janae.
6744211	6744831	You're not even listening.
6744851	6745231	That's okay.
6749012	6749673	Oh, dang.
6749893	6750973	Dang, I got snapped.
6753474	6754774	Okay, we'll be back.
6965723	6967684	and the rest of the band.
6990265	7005978	I'm in the back of your mind, a smile, but I'm not so blind Just reach out, it's all for love, you'll be the star tonight Get with it, finalize, you gotta tell me You know it's too late when you're dead, night, night, last in line
7070793	7077656	I need to know how you feel I just can't find my love for you I'm giving all my heart to you, my love I just can't find my love for you
7097703	7112313	I just decide my love for you I just decide my love for you I'm giving all my heart to you, my love I just decide my love for you I'm giving you my heart, my soul, my love I just decide my love for you I'm giving all my heart to you, my love I just decide my love for you
7138500	7141750	Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.
7142332	7143857	Orange Lounge Radio
7145391	7146371	Alright, we're back.
7146912	7148832	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
7149593	7153614	And we have the winner of this week's cage match, boys and girls.
7154274	7156655	And this was a very, very close vote, you guys.
7156995	7161857	The winning song only had one vote more than the other two songs.
7162497	7166339	So, like, the other two songs were tied, and the winning one only had one more vote than them.
7166839	7167399	So here it is.
7167459	7171321	Your winning song... Once again is Mona Lisa Overdrive.
7173522	7173822	We...
7177538	7178619	Oh, wait, I'm sorry, what'd you say?
7179379	7187224	I was saying, of course, it's riding off the frickin' boom success and jive or whatever, no, hype of the Matrix, so, what do you expect, I mean?
7187644	7188885	What, you talkin' jive?
7188905	7194569	Alright, jive, I don't know, I guess it's cause Janace... Janace?
7195269	7196690	Yes, I hear hissing.
7199412	7201293	Anyway, uh, so there you go.
7207254	7208174	So, what now?
7208474	7209715	I have nothing left to talk about.
7209755	7210555	Let's just end the show.
7211115	7211575	Okay, bye.
7212756	7215637	Does anybody have things they want to talk about for now?
7216177	7218398	We haven't done any of our game shows in a long time.
7218818	7219218	Wait, what?
7219438	7221179	We haven't done any of our shows in a long time.
7221199	7222059	Any of our game shows?
7222159	7222820	Our game shows.
7223180	7223680	Match Game.
7224220	7226321	I'm really afraid to do Match Game because there's too many people here.
7226846	7228527	So we just pick, you know, a few of us.
7228587	7229288	Okay, this is what we'll do.
7229328	7230188	This is what we'll do.
7230469	7231309	We'll do match game.
7231809	7237713	We'll do match game, and for the celebrities, for the celebrities, you pick one, and Loki will pick one, and I'll pick one.
7238514	7239114	For celebrities.
7240175	7241456	Okay, so, who are celebrities?
7241916	7243758	Wait, I haven't written questions for match game.
7243778	7244398	What am I going to do?
7245179	7245999	Just type them up.
7246239	7246720	We'll chat.
7247120	7247420	Okay.
7248501	7250102	Chat about something while I think of questions.
7252345	7254506	Oh yeah, we were going to do Bomani Mad Libs tonight.
7254746	7255466	Oh, that's right.
7255786	7257387	Can we... But I haven't typed with any.
7257827	7258367	I don't know.
7258487	7259727	Hold on, let me see if I can find some.
7261748	7263369	You're going to have to give me the computer to do it, Rob.
7263409	7264609	You need to fill in with a story.
7265189	7265389	Okay.
7265409	7266169	No, no, no, give me the computer.
7267410	7269090	I have to give Jamie the computer.
7269110	7269611	This is bad.
7269751	7269931	Here.
7270971	7271171	Here.
7272051	7272952	This is fucked up.
7276553	7280454	While you're waiting for him to do this stuff, go to RagnarokOnline.com and download that game.
7281974	7285075	You don't want to do it now because they'll interrupt their stream for Orange Blossom Radio.
7286235	7287756	We already just heard like a ton of music.
7288256	7290056	Doesn't everybody have like a T1 connection?
7290096	7290397	Come on.
7290477	7291537	We'll get to your music later, don't worry.
7293818	7294698	Talk about shit.
7294998	7296758	Well, I took a big dump earlier.
7296778	7297259	No, I'm kidding.
7299159	7299619	Are you leaving?
7302160	7303180	Yeah, I gotta go.
7303480	7304201	Sorry, guys.
7305721	7307122	F you to having to leave early.
7307922	7309762	Alright, soul, peace, and chicken grease.
7310002	7311243	Here's to the third season.
7312267	7312707	Thank you.
7312847	7313808	Drinks on the house.
7314368	7316710	As Battle Royale would say, one down, 13 to go.
7316870	7318551	I don't want any more freaking drinks.
7318951	7319271	Alright.
7320632	7320872	So...
7324469	7327110	Marin, tell us about this little manga you're reading.
7327130	7333412	This is the first volume of the English edition of Battle Royale.
7334453	7336914	And Jamie handed it to me, so I am looking at it.
7337474	7339174	And hi, Smoss, because I know your name.
7340235	7346137	And the art is kind of interesting, and there's like a squirrel-faced guy in here that I really want to die.
7346217	7347437	And hopefully he will die soon.
7348158	7350118	And that's about it.
7350418	7351999	Don't you think the Battle Royale thing is getting old?
7352870	7356212	Well, I had never seen Battle Royale until yesterday, so... Oh, okay.
7356232	7356952	So it's still new for you.
7357152	7357593	I'm just teasing.
7357613	7358553	I'm just giving Javen a hard time.
7361775	7362175	Oh, okay.
7362595	7363236	I get a long mic.
7363616	7365297	I'll come over here to the cuddling folks.
7366718	7373141	And since they wanted me to talk about marriage this episode and the people that are going to get married on this episode, I'm just kidding.
7373181	7373722	I know you guys.
7373742	7374602	You guys are still young.
7374802	7376203	You're still young and have a long way to go.
7376543	7378304	But are you enjoying each other's company this weekend?
7378804	7379104	Yeah.
7379425	7380325	What am I going to say?
7380405	7380565	No.
7384585	7385125	It's cute.
7386506	7389687	Yeah, speaking of which, we did play those two in Scandia yesterday.
7390748	7393409	How much time did you guys collectively spend at Scandia this weekend?
7394109	7395710	Um, let's see, wait.
7395790	7397331	Friday and Saturday.
7398271	7399412	So yeah, probably, you know.
7399852	7400252	About 12 hours?
7400272	7401713	6 hours each day?
7401953	7402413	Pretty much.
7402754	7404694	Any annoying Scandia people stories you want to tell?
7405095	7407536	Kids running across the DDR machine while you're trying to play.
7407556	7408876	Oh my god, it's not a crosswalk.
7408896	7409637	On stage, I mean.
7411358	7412198	I think, you know what?
7412833	7415134	We have a picture of it.
7415174	7423857	We had like this three-year-old up on the extreme just jumping around on stage to Rhythm and Police Lite.
7424397	7425318	It was hilarious.
7425338	7426758	We have like two pictures.
7426778	7427659	They'll be up on the album.
7428859	7429039	Yep.
7430700	7431220	Yes, Loki?
7434841	7437422	Oh, you want to talk about Seattle and the bar holding thing?
7437442	7438643	That's actually an excellent topic.
7438723	7439743	No, I like this topic.
7440143	7441164	Because, okay...
7442153	7443394	You don't bring anything up, Rob.
7458339	7460241	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7485303	7492069	But Seattle was kind of getting, I guess, knocked or jabbed at or poked fun at or whatever for being big old bar rapers.
7492189	7496953	Like, they hold onto the bar when they play their songs, which kind of creates a little bit of controversy.
7496993	7498514	Is that real PA or whatever?
7498534	7499455	You know, is it real?
7500294	7509540	and to them, looking at us, like, the way they're kind of looking at, or I should say, when I say us, I mean California, the way Seattle was kind of looking at California was kind of like, what's a big fucking deal?
7509800	7510121	You know?
7510701	7512502	It's that the bars are there, so why not use them?
7512863	7513563	So what do you guys think?
7513583	7516405	I'm just curious of people's opinions in here on bar raping, quote unquote.
7518086	7520728	Um, oops, okay, switch back off, okay.
7521228	7529934	Um, I really don't give a shit, because I saw a guy, Triple A, Max 300, yes, he was raping the bar, but I'd like to see anybody else try that.
7531047	7532749	It doesn't really matter.
7534672	7536114	Exactly, we do have a bleeder, okay?
7536154	7536394	Anyway.
7536995	7539177	I mean, think about it.
7539898	7541120	He doesn't want to fall on his ass.
7541140	7544364	He doesn't want to break his leg like whatever that guy's name was.
7545125	7548389	So, at least he's not freestyling and holding onto the bar.
7548429	7549030	That's different.
7549070	7549771	But PAing...
7551585	7562211	The only thing I didn't like, and it had nothing to do with bar raping, was the constant spraying down of Windex on the thing to rub down the pads to make sure they were absolutely clear and free of dust.
7562311	7562952	That was interesting.
7563032	7564593	I do think that was overdone a little bit.
7564953	7572137	I can see the need, okay, you're in a competition, and you want to make sure everything is perfect, perfection, but I was kind of like...
7572777	7574658	It does seem a little bit excessive.
7574758	7575178	I don't know.
7575218	7576839	But then again, it's another thing.
7576999	7580661	It's just culture, diversity, even within the DDR community, you know?
7581041	7582281	Up there, it's like, what's the big fucking deal?
7582301	7583782	That's what Windex is for, to clean things.
7586243	7589385	I only ever use... No, I don't even use Windex.
7589825	7595948	The only time I ever clean up pads is when I'm playing doubles, because if I'm going to be putting all my weight in one foot, I want to fucking slip and die.
7595968	7597908	If I'm playing singles, whatever.
7598088	7599349	You know, whatever the pads are, fine.
7599829	7601370	I don't know if...
7601983	7612147	They realize or even notice, but if you wash them, if you use some sort of solution to clean the pads, it makes it slippier, slippier, slipperier, slipper, whatever.
7612747	7613868	Slip, more slick.
7614408	7615168	Thanks, slick.
7615949	7616329	Slicker.
7616849	7618430	Uh, yeah, it does.
7619010	7620130	I don't know if they notice that or not.
7621211	7624112	I mean, maybe I should stop using, like, chicken grease, but I don't know.
7625646	7627447	This is my thought on the whole bar thing.
7628467	7635590	I always said before going to B3 and watching this in action, I always said, you know what, I'm not going to hold on to the bar because I'll look like a retard if I hold on to the bar and play DDR.
7635970	7641272	But after seeing some of those scores, I'm like, oh my god, I think I'm going to go back and start doing it.
7641972	7645133	because if holding onto the bar will make me that much better, I'm going to do it.
7645213	7648293	I don't care if there's this stigma like, oh, you're not supposed to hold onto the bar.
7648553	7648953	Fuck it.
7649053	7651194	If I can get scores that good, I'm going to hold onto the bar.
7651554	7657155	Sure enough, I go back, I play Legend of Max, I hold onto the bar this time, I got like 15 seconds further than I usually do.
7659496	7659996	Go figure.
7660556	7662196	Yes, thank you, my recent accomplishment.
7665037	7666337	I am two-fisting the mics.
7668077	7669938	Why did you give me a mic and Rob gave me a mic?
7669958	7670558	I've got both mics.
7670578	7670758	Take
7678223	7678963	Dead Air.
7681005	7683867	You always... Well, they always have to rely on me to bring up a topic.
7683907	7687269	Well, anything... Anybody else want to say anything about Bar... It's not my show.
7687309	7690231	It's three people here, and all you guys are here, too.
7690251	7691392	Hey, I brought up the topic.
7691432	7691992	That's right.
7693473	7696095	Jamie's researching our next topic, so it's up to you guys.
7697916	7699617	Because I just have to sit here and look pretty.
7700758	7700998	Okay.
7702459	7702959	New topic.
7703220	7703520	All right.
7704525	7707748	We're going to go with this year and pretty much last year.
7707788	7710050	This year I've noticed a lot of trends changing.
7710490	7712652	This is just like pop culture trends.
7713192	7719437	Example, before I used to make all these AIDS jokes, like you're going to get AIDS.
7720258	7721759	SARS is the AIDS of 2003.
7726087	7728169	Sars is not a joke.
7728549	7734233	We laughed so hard just over making Sars jokes during the whole trip.
7734333	7734934	It was great.
7736255	7739557	So, is there any other pop culture changes you want to address?
7739597	7742079	There was another one, but I can't remember it right now.
7742179	7743700	When you think of it, you bring it up, okay?
7744160	7744461	Okay.
7744561	7746122	Alright, in the meantime, Janae has a story.
7747068	7753473	Okay, I had this really weird story to tell, because just thinking of stars for a minute, it just made me think of something.
7753573	7755434	I went to the mall the other day, and I went to the store.
7755814	7758016	And as soon as I walked in the store, I started coughing really bad.
7758096	7759837	So I was like, oh my god, what's going on?
7760218	7761839	I thought it was like an anthrax attack.
7762579	7765121	And walking through the store, walking through, everybody's coughing.
7765461	7766662	No, anthrax was last year.
7766842	7768403	Well, anthrax was the year before last.
7768443	7771746	So anyways, but still, I was like, what the hell is going on?
7772306	7773247	Come to find out.
7773649	7780614	This kid that's at his cash register pepper sprayed his boss on accident because he didn't know that the thing was full and he was messing around with it.
7780975	7783256	And it infected the whole store with pepper spray.
7783757	7791382	So, that was really interesting to watch that and see the little, like, rent-a-cops come in and be like, We've got to confiscate your pepper spray.
7793264	7794905	Everybody was... Did they say it just like that?
7795225	7797447	We've got to confiscate your pepper spray!
7798948	7799148	No...
7800726	7805428	No, basically they have Krispy Kreme in one hand and say, we're going to complicate your pepper spray.
7806528	7807809	My donut is peppery.
7808549	7809590	Coughing, go.
7810370	7812091	Oh, is Jamie right?
7812111	7817653	Do you want to, just before we get over to Mad Libs, do you want to introduce yourself for our listeners?
7821274	7822575	Do you want to introduce yourself for our listeners?
7822955	7825176	How do I introduce myself to your listeners?
7825336	7829558	Tell them your online name and give them a quick personal ad because we know you're available.
7830983	7832884	I don't know how true that is.
7832984	7834085	Okay, my name is Janae.
7834265	7834906	I'm the board.
7835326	7836807	I'm Pixie Dust, and I'm 20.
7837807	7839749	I'm too damn old, is what I think.
7839849	7843991	And I'm looking at a picture of me holding up a McDonald's apple pie.
7844031	7845052	So, yeah, I'm sexy.
7845172	7845512	Okay.
7847674	7849074	Apple pie going straight to my thigh.
7850235	7852617	You know you want some of this Southern Fried Thigh.
7852657	7853757	You know that already.
7854938	7857880	I'm a little stupid and wacko, so, yeah.
7858420	7859521	Okay, I gotta live on me.
7862102	7863644	You had a quick thought, Loki, before we get to Madlib?
7864305	7864605	I did.
7865046	7865766	Okay, you looked like it.
7866107	7869592	Okay, Jamie, are we ready for Bumani Madlib?
7870996	7872717	Oh yeah, I remember now.
7873037	7873237	What?
7873377	7880600	My friend was on TV because he was the only UC student to stay over in China during the whole SARS thing while everyone else came home.
7881061	7882041	His name was Eric Fong.
7882101	7889144	If you're in the Sacramento area and you happen to be watching News 3 at 11 a couple days ago, you probably saw him.
7889705	7890745	His name is Eric Fong.
7890805	7893426	He used to make fun of me all the time, but we were really good friends.
7894347	7895247	Aww, it's so precious.
7895327	7898829	Anyway, let's get to our Bomani Mad Libs.
7899548	7900408	How's this going to work, Jamie?
7900509	7901389	Give Jamie a mic.
7904791	7908653	Basically, I'm going to tell you whether or not to say a verb, noun, adjective, whatever.
7909193	7909513	Okay.
7910053	7912334	You suggest one, you go around the room, everyone's suggesting one.
7912735	7912995	Okay.
7913255	7914856	One by one, and then we'll read you the story.
7914896	7923660	And by the way, this particular one, I'm not even going to give you the title or anything of what it is, but you get to find out what it is you're butchering after you put in the words.
7923760	7925561	So should they be Bomani-related words?
7926582	7927542	No, not necessarily.
7927782	7928563	Okay.
7928623	7929243	Be creative.
7929571	7930071	Be creative.
7930211	7930471	Okay.
7930571	7932972	But I will... I'm not even going to say that much.
7932992	7933312	Here you go.
7933712	7937373	So let's let... Why don't you go first, Matt?
7938594	7940954	Wait, you better hold onto a mic, Jamie, and we'll pass around the other one.
7941734	7944155	Wait, let me do... Hold the mic in my cleavage.
7944755	7945015	Okay.
7945596	7945936	All right.
7947356	7947756	It's there.
7948596	7948856	All right.
7948876	7951097	Okay, first one is... Don't look.

9220089	9221050	Welcome back, everybody.
9222205	9224570	It's time for everybody's favorite part of Orange Lounge.
9225272	9227055	It's the part where the chatroom really gets to participate.
9227576	9229039	It's Ask Orange Lounge!
9230373	9233335	Tonight you can ask Orange Lounge, that would be myself, DarkSakura, or Loki.
9233855	9234915	Or you could ask Marin.
9235336	9236876	You could ask Pixie Dust.
9237297	9240478	You could ask, well Nelly's probably not going to talk to you, but you could try asking her.
9241419	9242940	You could ask Brad, Irene.
9243720	9247182	You could ask Navi, but he probably won't talk to you either because he's setting up for Orange Crush.
9247602	9250484	Or you could ask DDR Angel and Magus, quite the cute couple over there.
9251884	9254206	Alright, let's get to the first questions, shall we?
9256427	9258608	Let's ask your ass, how are you feeling today?
9260609	9263091	That had a maturity level of like three.
9265252	9269975	First question from DJ Tyrant wants to know, when can I come up and be a guest on the show?
9270055	9270715	That's my question.
9271135	9273417	Well, when can you get in your car and drive?
9273857	9278120	Plus, you know, I don't know, I feel weird about having strangers in the house.
9278140	9285604	I mean, of course it worked before, because I didn't know Angel before she came up here to be on the show, so... Tyrant's not the only one that said he wants to be on the show, though.
9285904	9286945	Here's my recommendation to you.
9287365	9288446	Come to a tournament...
9289326	9294469	Come to a tournament, like, you know, we'll be... I'm sure at least one of the three of us will be at Cyber Beat Nation 2.
9295490	9298112	Or come to us at a tournament, get to know us there.
9298632	9299853	Or just come.
9300353	9300974	Or just come.
9302094	9304796	And then, once we get to know you, okay, come on a show.
9307157	9307578	That's my...
9308840	9315706	That's my biggest recommendation to you, though, is come to a tournament and get warmed up to the show first, because that's an easy way to be on the show.
9316066	9318548	You don't have to sit here and be bored in the studio like everyone else.
9318948	9319209	All right.
9320950	9322651	Let's get to the next question from Ninst.
9323272	9327235	Ninst would like to know, what is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?
9327255	9329137	Forty-two.
9329197	9330058	Forty-two, says Mary.
9330338	9331159	Forty-two, says Jamie.
9331979	9333140	Sixty-nine, says Skye.
9333460	9333961	Thirty-seven.
9337631	9338832	Janae might have a serious answer.
9340854	9341394	My ass.
9342535	9343135	Your ass.
9343195	9344496	That's wonderful.
9344536	9345637	That's the second person.
9346418	9347739	The meaning of life really is 42.
9348419	9350941	The earth was constructed to solve the riddle of the meaning of life.
9351442	9355225	Unfortunately, it was destroyed before it could finish the computation, so it came up with 42.
9356466	9358647	Now, the purpose of life is easy.
9359468	9360889	The purpose of life is not dying.
9362751	9363531	The purpose of life.
9363731	9364212	Breathe in.
9364512	9365032	Breathe out.
9365333	9365693	Repeat.
9367768	9369389	I have a serious answer to this question.
9369469	9370310	Can you people handle it?
9370831	9371111	No.
9372472	9373233	Okay, I'm going to try.
9373253	9376096	I'm going to try a serious answer to this question.
9376576	9380560	The meaning of life is to experience every possible emotion possible.
9382182	9383884	That's not an awe.
9383944	9385766	That's like death can be one of those.
9386266	9387167	I still think the answer is 42.
9387287	9387467	It's 42.
9390583	9391544	I feel deathly ill.
9391844	9394126	I woke up the other day and I went, ah, I'm deathly ill.
9395027	9395307	Alright.
9396368	9398830	That's, that's... You know what's funny?
9399290	9400872	I'm experiencing vomit from that.
9400912	9402713	You know what the meaning of life is?
9403173	9406917	Well, actually, you'll never know because once you figure out the meaning of life, that's when you die.
9408278	9410960	See, so if you ever do figure out the meaning of life, you will die.
9411360	9412921	That's why no one has ever figured it out.
9413502	9415704	The meaning of, ah, shit, dead...
9419072	9420373	The meaning of my life is cake.
9420593	9421854	Second question from Nance.
9422415	9426658	Have you taken part in practicing towel day, which is today, May 25th?
9427058	9428539	What the hell is towel day?
9428639	9429700	Today is towel day.
9430140	9430760	Yes, I have.
9430820	9431781	I had a towel on my head.
9431821	9432382	Thank you very much.
9434223	9435544	A towel touched my boobs today.
9438206	9440007	I took a shower, I had to dry off.
9440327	9444130	I heard some scandalous about towels in the shower just a little while ago.
9444510	9449413	I don't use towels, I use those hand dryer things, I like bought one and it's on my wall.
9449554	9452516	Wait, what do you do, you just kind of like straddle the dryer?
9452856	9455478	Exactly, it's an industrial one so I straddle the dryer.
9455498	9456999	It's towel day, does he know?
9459040	9461022	That's awful, I hope you get beat for that.
9462162	9462903	Alright, moving on.
9463999	9465760	Next question from John Fields.
9467021	9469743	Just how many people in California have SARS?
9470463	9475286	I want to be on the show when I visit California, but if SARS is a problem, I may wait for next summer to visit.
9476767	9478888	That's got to be the dumbest question I've ever heard.
9480249	9480869	Why is that?
9481250	9487333	Because anyone who's been in America who's gotten SARS has gotten treatment for it and are, like, better.
9488094	9489435	I think it was a joke.
9490695	9491116	You know what?
9491136	9492717	We're not Toronto, so get over it.
9494720	9497783	Toronto is just trying to be special because they're Canadian.
9498283	9502667	They're just like, look at us, we're Chinese, sort of.
9503448	9504229	We have SARS.
9505270	9505910	We're SARS-y.
9507532	9508613	We got SARS-ay.
9508853	9510274	Alright, moving on.
9511035	9511595	Black Lab.
9511776	9516220	Oh, excellent question from Black Lab referring to the chat room earlier this week.
9516800	9518642	Okay, we have to get an answer from everybody on this.
9519998	9527026	Have you ever been to that point where you were just so hungry, you are so deathly hungry, you would just do anything?
9527306	9530449	The question from Black Lab, would you give a blowjob for a pizza?
9531190	9531951	He never done that!
9534918	9536019	Notice how I don't contest it.
9537040	9539762	I wouldn't give a blowjob for any reason because it's nasty.
9541364	9544927	I'm sorry, but it's the whole concept of putting your mouth where someone pisses from.
9546388	9550131	So I would probably say that what I would do instead is get in my car and go buy one.
9552493	9553574	Let's say you don't have any money.
9554855	9556456	Then I would kill someone for pizza.
9557097	9558118	But I would never blow them.
9559859	9560640	Anybody else want to comment?
9561641	9562601	I agree with Jamie.
9562641	9563022	Thank you.
9564582	9567503	Well, I'd receive one for pizza, then I'd have blowjob pizza.
9569044	9569984	Excuse me.
9570144	9570725	Okay.
9570885	9573686	Here's an excellent plug for our forums right here.
9573786	9578107	Visit www.caliabomani.com slash NBOR3 where our forums are.
9578528	9582329	And Zero put an excellent answer to this question earlier this week, so go read it.
9584170	9588892	Let's change this show from Orange Lounge to Dick Haters because...
9590430	9592350	I don't hate... Hey, uh-uh, uh-uh.
9592550	9594971	We ain't... Dick-hating feminazis.
9594991	9595531	There you go.
9595591	9597071	Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
9597732	9600992	I don't... It's not that I hate the dick.
9602373	9604633	It's just I don't find it particularly appetizing.
9604673	9605853	Let me put it this way.
9606173	9609214	It's like, to Jamie, dick is like a teddy bear.
9609234	9613215	You know, you can fluff it and play with it and hug it and squeeze it, but you're not going to eat it.
9614691	9616212	You put it in your cooch?
9618193	9619773	To me, dick is foreign.
9620033	9623895	It is so foreign, it's like Japan, so I don't know where it is.
9624415	9624975	So foreign.
9625296	9626116	Let's revise this.
9626616	9627496	Let's revise this.
9628077	9629577	What would you do for a Klondike bar?
9630878	9632419	But that's chocolate, that's different.
9632539	9633459	Anyway, moving on.
9633479	9635560	What would you do for an Oreo Klondike bar?
9635600	9636000	Moving on.
9636420	9639021	I want to get through these AskCourseLounge questions.
9639061	9640042	Okay, here we go.
9640202	9640482	Here we go.
9641804	9646566	I just heard, oh, this is from CrashOverride003, as opposed to 0070s003.
9646826	9648787	He or she, sorry.
9649387	9653729	I just heard that DDR Extreme is the last arcade game for the DDR series.
9653869	9654549	Oh, that old rumor.
9655209	9655889	Is this true?
9656810	9657430	That old rumor.
9658170	9661892	If it is the last, will be complete BS.
9663492	9664673	And, again, that old rumor.
9665833	9667034	You know what, this is my thought.
9667054	9668534	Again, there is no definitive answer.
9668714	9670255	If we knew the definitive answer, we'd tell you.
9672148	9673569	I have the definitive answer.
9674449	9675229	Who gives a shit?
9675269	9676109	This DDR sucks.
9677049	9677429	Shut up.
9678810	9679750	No, it's not the last one.
9679770	9681110	The next one will be the last one.
9681450	9684871	And they're going to continue it on the console because DDR is not popular in Japan.
9684911	9685591	Popular music is.
9686551	9688012	Here's my thought on it.
9688512	9690372	As far as the USA is concerned, it's true.
9690592	9692913	There's probably not going to be any other USA machines.
9693153	9694513	It's pretty much a home only thing.
9695053	9696554	Japan, nobody really knows.
9696614	9697454	But here's my thought.
9698243	9701765	It's probably the last version of DDR in its current form.
9701865	9706567	If they do another DDR, it's going to be like DDR DX type thing.
9706707	9707827	That's my honest opinion on it.
9708808	9710248	So we get Technomotion, I see.
9710728	9711069	Hopefully.
9711849	9712049	Not.
9712269	9712529	Anyway.
9714410	9714850	Let's see.
9715010	9716391	Also, second part of this question.
9716671	9719672	Oh, and when are they going to fire Naoki and replace him?
9719732	9722153	Some of his material is just plain shit now these days.
9722213	9725975	Don't you know that they clone Naoki every year and keep using his clones?
9728470	9728850	I don't know.
9729711	9734413	I do notice that Extreme kind of had less Naoki tracks than usual, but I don't think.
9734693	9737454	He's still doing music for 2DX and all that, so he's still around.
9737554	9740376	From what I understand, isn't he also actually working on Gradius?
9740796	9741076	Gradius 5?
9741236	9742997	Yeah, he's got things to do.
9744478	9744738	All right.
9746219	9749280	Okay, so I'm going to cut off the question submission now.
9749360	9752282	So I've got four questions left to burn through here, and then we're going to get to Orange Crush.
9752742	9753022	Okay.
9753973	9757715	KeenMaker in Exile wants to know, oh, that's not a question.
9757775	9759195	Well, okay, good question, I guess.
9759596	9761636	Why the fuck do I live so far away?
9762637	9765158	That's actually zero under another name.
9766379	9767339	Because you do.
9767739	9771241	Because it's closer to my work, so thusly everybody else must suffer because I'm lazy.
9772761	9776983	DJ Tyrant would like to know, would just like to say that he'll be there at CBN too.
9777043	9777343	Thank you.
9779865	9782786	Ninst would like to know, what would Jesus do for a Klondike bar?
9783598	9784558	He'd die for your sins.
9787280	9788881	What would Jesus do for a Klondike bar?
9789121	9789821	Die for your sins.
9791942	9794023	I thought you said something about five cents.
9794083	9794763	Die five cents.
9795984	9797245	He'd just, you know, hang around.
9797265	9800026	He'd pick up a piece of shit and turn it into a Klondike bar.
9804548	9806149	Jesus would blow the pizza man.
9809050	9809791	Anyway, okay.
9811004	9811945	It came from FuzzyHalf
9828757	9830058	from Dracona's Daughter.
9831258	9834480	She was at a DDR tournament and said, this DDR sucks.
9834880	9835140	Yeah.
9835481	9836461	So there you go.
9836581	9838382	Was that at CVGL or was that at... It was Lily.
9838922	9842064	I know it was Lily that said it, but was that at CVGL or was that at the Mountain Mike's one?
9842284	9842724	Mountain Mike's.
9842744	9843625	I think it was the Mountain Mike's one.
9844305	9847147	I thought it was from, what was it, that huge tournament?
9847167	9847647	No, it was TVGL.
9847927	9856291	I thought it was that huge SoCal tournament or whatever that they were competing for freestyle or whatever, and it was for the Solo Machine.
9856311	9857932	That was Solo Sucks anyway.
9857952	9858872	That's Solo Sucks anyway.
9858992	9859653	That's the other one.
9860233	9868057	But, yeah, this DDR Sucks came from... It was TVGL because we did the Step Squad thing at Mount Lykes, the promo at Mount Lykes.
9868777	9869517	Oh, okay.
9869557	9870718	She didn't kill, I went.
9870878	9873959	I thought it was the same day that you guys had done that promo, but it was she didn't kill one.
9873979	9874679	No, it was before.
9874959	9876700	We tried to get her to say it again and she wouldn't.
9877000	9877920	Either way, I wasn't there.
9878900	9879220	Alright.
9880541	9883782	So, now it's time for Orange Crush.
9884322	9887143	So, Irene, who's competing in Orange Crush today?
9890224	9892464	If it's about pop and music, I say it's me versus Jamie.
9893185	9894345	Okay, you have it.
9896720	9898921	Wait, hold on, I've got to get the theme music.
9900042	9901402	Let's listen to Jamie's elbow.
9901562	9903883	Hold on, now it's time for Orange Crush, we have to play the theme music.
9907724	9910425	Now it's time for Orange Crush.
9910946	9913627	Now it's time for Orange Crush.
9913867	9916048	Alright.
9917668	9919209	Okay, Irene, take it away.
9919369	9919609	You can...
9923175	9924416	Do I need to leave the room then first?
9924676	9925236	Okay.
9925256	9928177	Tell them about the topic and stuff, and somebody else needs to time.
9928197	9931778	Can somebody time for me, please?
9933358	9936439	Garrett, go keep him company since you know all the answers to the questions anyway.
9936459	9938140	First of all, I know shit about pop music.
9938160	9939020	Does anybody have a watch?
9939040	9939500	You'll keep time.
9939540	9940381	It's 30 seconds.
9940581	9941201	Can you do that?
9943042	9944362	Anybody can count to 30?
9944722	9945302	Okay, cool.
9945782	9946483	Just let me know.
9946503	9946583	Okay.
9947023	9947263	Okay.
9947901	9951465	The theme for tonight is called Five Button Mode.
9965977	9977001	Which song from Guitar Freaks 9 and Drum Mini 8 came from Poppin' Music 8?
9978342	9981363	Which Poppin' Music artist is getting the newest Artist Collection CD?
9984924	9989826	In Poppin' Music 7, the song Platonic Love is done by Nard, who is better known by which alias?
9991195	9991495	I don't know.
9991815	9992015	Okay.
9992455	9995036	What are the names of the two star characters in poppin' music?
9998337	10003819	Nyami and... Oh, no.
10004479	10005459	I don't play poppin' music.
10005499	10006379	Why was I picked?
10006820	10008100	Oh, I'm sorry.
10009440	10009860	Okay.
10010341	10011661	You didn't get any of them right.
10011761	10014602	So you got half of one right, but you didn't finish it.
10014642	10015082	Yeah.
10018118	10020479	But and Munch, Neil and Bob.
10022960	10025180	Okay, Rob, it's your turn.
10025900	10027121	Thank you for playing, Jamie.
10027421	10027841	Thank you.
10028381	10029341	Rob's not going to do any better.
10030422	10031402	Oops, did I say that out loud?
10032602	10032842	Okay.
10033302	10036063	We're just waiting for Rob.
10036763	10038804	So, go check out RagnarConline.com.
10039424	10039744	I know.
10040564	10041845	Shameless plug, shameless plug.
10043254	10045535	I hope everyone likes all these poppin' music questions.
10046176	10047136	I have to thank Garrett.
10047236	10050458	Garrett came up with these questions, because he's amazing.
10050478	10052259	Garrett's the frickin' awesome... Navi.
10052599	10053000	Navi?
10053040	10053620	What is a Navi?
10053640	10054240	You watch Lane?
10054801	10055421	From Link.
10055561	10056542	I'm sorry, Navi.
10056562	10058523	Uh-oh.
10059083	10059543	Okay.
10060224	10061204	Okay, Rob, are you ready?
10063305	10063766	By Janae.
10065146	10066747	I haven't been fucked like that since grade school.
10066947	10067688	By Janae, thank you.
10068328	10068848	Okay, my turn.
10068868	10069829	Ooh, I can play Orange Crush.

10120004	10121005	Wait, okay, what's the fifth question?
10121045	10122066	I just want to see if I can answer it.
10122086	10127189	The fifth question that neither of you got to was, the vocalist from the Swedish song did which song in eighth style?
10128851	10129311	Hour Shadow?
10134753	10135894	Or is it Halfway of Promise?
10135994	10136094	No.
10136634	10136995	Which one?
10137715	10138516	I'll tell you in a minute.
10138556	10138996	Alright, fine.
10139016	10139717	Let's go over the answers.
10139797	10140617	We'll go over the answers.
10140697	10141558	Okay, first question.
10141598	10144880	Which song from Guitar Freaks 9 and Drum Mini 8 came from Poppin' Music 8?
10145561	10146161	Rob is right.
10147122	10146161	777.
10147402	10148283	You know how I knew that?
10148303	10150284	Because that's in rotation on Orange Laundry Radio.
10150404	10150685	I know.
10151125	10152066	Okay, question number two.
10152106	10155028	Which Poppin' Music artist is getting the newest artist collection CD?
10155068	10156229	Let me think about this one a little longer.
10156469	10158410	It's a Poppin' Music artist getting a collection CD.
10159051	10159131	Um...
10161471	10165212	I'm just trying to think of the artists that have a lot of songs in pop and music.
10165392	10167793	I would... The classic?
10167913	10168814	The classical ones?
10168894	10176036	It's either going to be A, Des Rho, B, Hideo Sua, or C, Parkets?
10176116	10178097	I would actually say, before I say Des Rho, I'd say Hideo Sua.
10178897	10179738	No, it's Parkets.
10180118	10180238	Oh.
10180418	10180738	Haha.
10181238	10185560	Okay, third... Des Rho has his own albums, and Des Rho hasn't gotten anything yet.
10186092	10186592	Yeah, haha.
10187173	10188273	Okay, question number three.
10188353	10193097	In Poppin' Music 7, the song Platonic Love is done by Nard, who is better known by which alias?
10193237	10193517	Yes.
10194297	10194377	Oh!
10195802	10198244	slash DJ Nagrius slash Tiger Yamada.
10198264	10198324	Duh!
10198904	10200385	Okay, either one of those would have been accepted.
10200445	10201606	Okay, fourth question.
10201666	10205848	What are the names of the two star characters in poppin' music, Niami and Nimi?
10207149	10209230	Wow.
10209310	10210531	I was thinking of the other ones.
10210551	10214994	I was trying to think of that chick from Dimanche that looks like a hussy in the second one.
10215854	10216815	Yeah, I know.
10216895	10218556	And then I had the image of them.
10218636	10220337	Oh, that's what they're talking about, and I had no idea.
10220777	10221818	Okay, and the fifth question.
10221898	10224620	The vocalist from the Swedish song did which song in 8th style?
10225320	10226301	Murmur Twins.
10226981	10230204	Oh, I should have known because it's like Garrett's favorite eight styles.
10230264	10230784	Or one of them.
10231204	10231925	One of them, isn't it?
10234221	10237502	I love number twins.
10237682	10238143	Okay.
10238983	10241524	And that concludes another episode of Orange Crush.
10241644	10242444	Thank you very much.
10242484	10243084	That was beautiful.
10243104	10243524	You're welcome.
10243724	10244085	Here you go.
10244405	10244785	Good job.
10244845	10246165	I hope the chat room enjoyed that.
10246725	10247946	Jamie and I making butts.
10248106	10251907	Jamie and I making butts out of ourselves with our lack of pop and music knowledge.
10251927	10253548	Because he made the questions.
10253788	10254428	I got yummy.
10254828	10256749	I like to give mad props to Garrett.
10257829	10258930	Oh, he's on compliments.
10259370	10261411	You know, I got it because she was in YY Racing.
10261451	10263372	And I am so down with Garrett.
10263632	10269295	The only reason I knew like any of those, or would have known it, you know, I'm such good friends with Garrett, and I still didn't know.
10274198	10276719	Okay, so, can I get my chair back?
10277560	10278020	Please?
10278953	10279613	Please.
10280613	10280874	Alright.
10282274	10283494	What else do you guys want to talk about?
10283834	10285775	Do you want to say something about poppin' music?
10285795	10287455	Because we never talk about poppin' music in the show.
10287475	10288436	You want to say something about it?
10290156	10290736	Want to say it, Navi?
10292197	10294097	Hi, I'll say something about poppin' music.
10294457	10300419	Since apparently no one ever really plays it, except for like me and then people in SoCal, as demonstrated by that last quiz.
10300973	10309957	Yeah, um, uh, news, uh, Poppin' Music 8 is coming out on July 3rd, um, at home, along with Silent Hill 3 is being released on the same date.
10311257	10317840	Um, uh, the wonderful little site, Nifty slash Globalgate, where you can translate all those fun Japanese pages into English.
10318430	10321714	clearly demonstrated how confusing their sites are.
10321834	10325918	It's either that or the Japanese are weird with the way that they, I don't know.
10326479	10338952	In my Japanese class, I learn all kinds of stuff about their culture and how, you know, like an example, you don't say you don't want something, you just say, oh, I'll take a little of it, and that means you don't want it, because it's too rude to say you don't want it.
10339912	10349658	Same kind of goes for when I was trying to translate these pages and read about the pre-orders for the limited edition Poppin' Music stuff, see what the hell they're all putting in it.
10350418	10360644	It looks like, from the way everything is worded and separated, they have the limited edition package, and then they have the privileged limited edition package.
10361576	10366400	Which I don't really get what the hell is going on, but needless to say, they're loading this shit up.
10366800	10368982	I don't know why they don't do this for any other Bimani games.
10369563	10372985	But Poppin' Music 7 had tons and tons of stuff in it.
10373045	10374527	This one has just as much.
10375047	10383654	They're putting in long... Besides the VRare CD, we have a new sticker pack with all kinds of stickers of characters and stuff.
10384155	10384655	There's...
10385996	10386737	Poppin' Music 8 Poppin' Music 8
10416396	10422558	God, there was some more stuff too, I can't remember at all, but it's one big humongous package of goodies.
10423499	10426880	And there's going to be well over a hundred songs in Poppin' Music 8.
10427700	10437344	There were 54 new songs to begin with in 8, and usually with how they do the consumer stuff, there'll be another 10 to 15 consumer tracks that they add on to this.
10438024	10441245	So it's going to be quite a nice game.
10442845	10444026	Yeah, I don't know what else to say.
10445262	10446302	I'm moist of anticipation.
10446462	10447263	That was so funny.
10447403	10450024	One big humongous package of goodies.
10450804	10454305	Yeah, pop music tends to be in test located right now in Japan also.
10454665	10456626	I came up with a stupid thing that you could use.
10457146	10457366	What?
10458707	10461168	Now introducing Orange Lounge with a fresher scent.
10462228	10462608	Thank you.
10462628	10463349	That's very clever.
10463649	10464089	Very cute.
10465091	10465972	Not feeling so fresh?
10466432	10467352	Try the new Orange Lounge.
10467372	10468493	Douche with Orange Lounge.
10468773	10469013	Anyway.
10471334	10472475	Oh, my.
10472495	10473996	Thank you very much for the pop music update.
10474016	10474596	We appreciate that.
10475036	10477998	We'll have to bring you back to do it again because none of us keep tabs on pop music.
10478018	10480699	You're the only person in the whole North State, I think, that plays it regularly.
10481019	10486963	Oh, yeah, and then I'll really get to play it once I get my arcade-style controller so I can tell you how wonderful that is and then you guys can be jealous.
10488503	10489244	I'll get to play it.
10489264	10489924	You better let me play it.
10489944	10493606	You have to bring it to an episode and then we'll just have an episode of Orange Lounge where I hear in the background, Pop!
10496536	10501977	Okay, I also want to give the mic to Loki real fast because it's been two weeks with no sim update so he might have something to say.
10504347	10507429	Um, there's still Tourney Mix 4, which I gotta work on my entry for that.
10508030	10511552	And, um, there's, you know, check my sims, tons of stuff there.
10511592	10512573	My site's still gone.
10513533	10517236	And, um, um, let me see.
10518697	10522379	Oh, oh, new DWI version, there's a 2.49, I think.
10522939	10526982	And it's got, like, a bunch of bug fixes and stuff, so we're good to go and download that.
10527062	10527642	It's pretty cool.
10528563	10532966	And, um, other than that, I don't think there's really anything going on.
10535057	10535417	Yep.
10536077	10536337	No.
10537078	10537418	Okay.
10538558	10545120	Okay, since we have such a long-ass fortune cookie message today, thanks to Jamie, I'm going to go around and collect everyone's final thought.
10545160	10545660	It's that time.
10546000	10546920	It's that time of the show, you guys.
10546940	10547500	End of show.
10547580	10549241	So I guess since Irene's got the mic, we'll start with her.
10549741	10549821	No?
10549841	10550641	We're going to start with Garrett?
10551441	10552362	Garrett doesn't have a final thought.
10553382	10553902	No final thought.
10554422	10555262	Nellie have a final thought?
10558003	10559744	The show fucking sucks, says Nellie.
10559784	10560244	Thank you.
10560344	10560704	We agree.
10562124	10562504	Irene.
10563325	10563985	Brad, final thought.
10567262	10569783	Go to RagnarConline.com and download the game.
10571044	10571404	Thank you.
10572184	10572665	That is all.
10572985	10573705	Play on Loki.
10573785	10574386	That's where I am.
10574546	10575466	Play on Chaos.
10575506	10576126	Play on Loki.
10576727	10578167	Play on Chaos Loki.
10579208	10579508	Yeah.
10580088	10581329	How about we all just get a life?
10582089	10584150	I don't think Loki would appreciate you all playing on him.
10585471	10586872	Final thought, Irene.
10587812	10588713	Garrett's great.
10588793	10591054	He did my hair and it looks so awesome.
10591754	10592034	Yeah.
10592415	10593355	Okay, bye.
10593415	10594616	Final thought, Pixie Dust.
10595859	10597479	I just want to meet a cute boy.
10598340	10598940	I'm right here.
10599160	10602461	I said a cute boy, not a Buddha boy.
10602481	10604901	I am so offended.
10605221	10606021	Get out of my house.
10607282	10610923	Nigga, please.
10611503	10612723	She is part black.
10612743	10613563	She can say that word.
10616124	10617604	That's why I can say fag, because I'm gay.
10617944	10620785	Okay, Angel.
10620925	10621905	Angel, final thought.
10622245	10625306	I'm just glad I got to spend the weekend with my best friends ever.
10627205	10627365	Aw.
10627686	10629066	Everybody, aw, DDR Angel.
10631087	10631327	Aw.
10632048	10633608	Okay, I'm loved now.
10634268	10635109	Magus, final thought.
10636890	10639471	Well, ha ha, I'm still better than the Clippers, bitch.
10643372	10643813	Anyway.
10646134	10648275	Marin, final thought.
10650836	10651716	Aw, she doesn't have a final thought.
10651736	10652636	Thank you for coming, Marin.
10652677	10653377	Everybody give Marin a hand.
10653457	10653777	Yay.
10656435	10657855	So many new faces on tonight's show.
10657895	10658236	It's nice.
10658656	10660036	They can't see any of them.
10660056	10662237	Yeah, you can't see any of them because we were too lazy to set the webcam.
10663017	10664458	You want me to go to Loki for final thought here?
10664798	10665038	Okay.
10665839	10667059	Richie, I love you.
10668900	10669680	Loki, final thought.
10671901	10673262	I hate you, PayPal.
10675863	10676983	Let me just make this clear.
10677343	10678624	A cute single boy.
10679639	10684584	Yeah, single, straight, not gay, because I have a lot of gay male friends.
10686947	10692113	No, as in, not, I don't know, just not seeing anybody.
10695201	10696742	I want the age range of 21 to 27.
10697222	10697643	Yeah.
10700364	10700764	Anyway.
10701224	10701885	Yeah, exactly.
10703466	10704866	I'll let Jamie have the final, final thought.
10704906	10712830	My final thought is me and EvilNaoki2DX, our Japanese schoolgirl love, love, sugar routine is going to be the best thing ever.
10715832	10716352	Jamie, your turn.
10717233	10717793	My turn?
10717813	10718533	Okay.
10719614	10719894	Okay.
10722702	10723062	I turned.
10724142	10725383	No, but none of them saw that.
10725403	10726023	That was bad radio.
10726963	10729964	My final thought is... I just thought it.
10730104	10730304	Bye.
10731805	10732065	Okay.
10732265	10733185	I thought my thoughts.
10733645	10736366	And tonight... I'm tired.
10737346	10744309	The last word of tonight's show goes to... You've had it before.
10744909	10746609	I'm going to... Maren, because she didn't say it in front of us.
10746649	10747109	Last word.
10747910	10748770	Burnin' Nation.
10750646	10753007	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

10769953	10772634	Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.
10773495	10775215	Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure.

10808062	10808922	Damn straight.
10809383	10811744	And remember, this be CNN.
10811764	10816748	Thanks for listening and we'll see you next week.
10844876	10845701	Thanks for watching!
10874364	10875185	and Fade to Black.
10876906	10878787	The afterbirth of Orange Lounge Radio.
10883010	10886432	Not the stillbirth, the afterbirth of Orange Lounge Radio.
10886492	10889614	Anybody have anything extra they wanted to add that they didn't get out during the three hours?
10890095	10891576	Something that they don't want in the archives?
10892156	10892376	Wow.
10892436	10893497	You're really white, you know that?
10893557	10895018	I want to play that song at the very end.
10909060	10911163	I didn't know Brad was married.
10911724	10912566	Does he have a wife?
10915209	10916051	Are they in Utah?
10917413	10917653	Well...
10927437	10935983	I'd just like to add an extra plug for our Bomani Music and More program, which is always on when we're not here, because we love people that listen to Orange Lounge Radio all the time.
10936364	10938866	I'd like to add an extra plug to your ass, Ron.
10939446	10942268	How do you know it's not already plugged?
10942448	10943729	There's too many plugs in there.
10943749	10944510	Add an extra plug.
10944992	10946512	Oh, an extra plug, I'm sorry.
10947213	10950673	You know, you remember that sex scene in the Matrix with all the plugs?
10951373	10953774	Did you see the sex scene in the Matrix Reloaded?
10953794	10953974	No.
10954034	10955574	How they had all the plugs in them?
10955895	10957575	I was like, I wonder if they got one in their butt.
10960236	10965517	I think this has been an enlightening experience, and I know this, that I'm surrounded by dirty mofos.
10966677	10967397	You fit right in.
10968477	10970658	I'm a dirty mofo too, so I fit just right in.
10974622	10974982	Beautiful.
10978784	10979264	Hey, Rob.
10979504	10979764	Yes?
10980265	10982225	Do I have a phone sex operator voice?
10982406	10983146	Kinda, why?
10983166	10985827	A lot of guys tell me that for some odd reason when I'm on the phone.
10985847	10988488	Why don't you give us your best phone sex operator voice right now.
10991790	10994531	Here, let's pretend I'm calling a 900 line, okay?
10994551	10995231	Here we go.
10995271	10998953	This is me and Pixie S. This is me calling a straight 900 number line, okay?
10998973	10999133	Ready?
11000013	11000814	Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.
11001254	11001794	Hello.
11001814	11003075	Hi?
11003115	11003355	Hi?
11004656	11005797	What's your name, little boy?
11006597	11007898	My name is Brad.
11013801	11014702	Well, hello, Brad.
11014742	11015742	What are you wearing right now?
11017123	11020425	I'm wearing a red shirt and khakis.
11021406	11022786	Why are you wearing so much clothing?
11022887	11023447	Take it off.
11023707	11026509	Okay.
11026529	11027609	Why should I take it off?
11028110	11029951	Because you're a naughty, naughty boy.
11030431	11032072	And you know you want some Miracle Whip.
11035785	11037605	What are you going to do to me, Miss Phone Lady?
11039346	11042087	My name is Dambi, and I want to ravage your cunt.
11043987	11044967	I don't have a cunt.
11046008	11047208	Well, pretend you do.
11051869	11053930	You all can ravage your cunts all later.
11060531	11061491	I can't take it anymore.
11062112	11062412	Okay.
11064099	11067021	I hope that was good enough for you, baby, as good it was for me.
11067442	11067882	I came.
11068022	11068762	That was so great.
11068943	11069483	Oh, thank you.
11075247	11083553	I imagine these phone sex operators are probably sitting back there, you know, knitting or doing their laundry or playing with their Game Boy while they're...
11084944	11085965	I came to the final boss.
11108228	11108848	That was beautiful.
11110209	11113091	I'm still queuing up the post-show music, so does anybody else want to add something?
11113232	11115073	There's something for, like, somebody coming.
11115493	11115813	Oh, yes!
11116074	11116394	Oh, yes!
11116574	11116914	Oh, yes!
11117174	11118195	I beat Legend of Max!
11118535	11118956	Oh, yeah!
11119536	11120196	Oh, yeah!
11121057	11122158	No, it's the DDR machine.
11122378	11122898	Oh, God!
11123299	11123779	Oh, God!
11123919	11124439	It does that.
11125300	11128522	On the third mixes, if you triple-A it, it'll go, oh, God!
11128863	11129283	Oh, God!
11129323	11129703	Like that.
11133286	11134086	You guys are horrible.
11134707	11135127	Bag it.
11135839	11137120	Okay, we're going to go now.
11137901	11138682	Good night, everybody.
11140003	11146429	Loki would like to play a quick remix for you that he really likes, and then we're going to have a mini 2DX marathon, so you guys should enjoy that, shouldn't you?
11147750	11149872	And that'll be it.
11150773	11152314	So, Loki, introduce this mix.
11153235	11154517	This is Max Wishful.
11154577	11156839	It's a remix of Max 300 and...
