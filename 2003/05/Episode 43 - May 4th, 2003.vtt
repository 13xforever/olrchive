WEBVTT

00:00.516 --> 00:02.858
[SPEAKER_01]: Message for you, son!

00:03.318 --> 00:04.159
[SPEAKER_05]: Attention!

00:05.180 --> 00:08.662
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

00:10.684 --> 00:15.708
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

00:19.378 --> 00:22.280
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

00:22.620 --> 00:25.782
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

00:26.362 --> 00:29.084
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

00:29.624 --> 00:32.506
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

00:33.307 --> 00:33.727
[SPEAKER_21]: Just kidding.

00:33.907 --> 00:35.508
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

00:35.728 --> 00:43.192
[SPEAKER_03]: In this episode... Hey, are there any balls down there?

00:43.433 --> 00:45.894
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the biggest berry you've ever seen, Jingleberry.

00:45.994 --> 00:46.935
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your favorite skit?

00:49.142 --> 00:49.723
[SPEAKER_12]: Showgirls.

00:50.623 --> 00:51.784
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely frightening.

00:52.044 --> 00:52.585
[SPEAKER_12]: What's yours?

00:52.845 --> 00:55.326
[SPEAKER_12]: There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

00:55.387 --> 00:56.627
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't torture yourself.

00:57.268 --> 00:58.169
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my job.

00:58.229 --> 01:00.010
[SPEAKER_03]: Now's the time on Sprockets and me dogs!

01:00.090 --> 01:04.753
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog too!

01:05.113 --> 01:05.934
[SPEAKER_18]: I know Kung Fu.

01:06.394 --> 01:08.776
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

01:09.036 --> 01:10.898
[SPEAKER_12]: Why did they have to take the word game?

01:12.499 --> 01:15.161
[SPEAKER_07]: No one expects a Spanish exposition!

01:15.381 --> 01:16.001
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Kendo.

01:16.021 --> 01:16.281
[SPEAKER_09]: Kendo!

01:19.093 --> 01:20.895
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura Shut up!

01:21.095 --> 01:21.776
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's my gun?

01:21.916 --> 01:24.238
[SPEAKER_09]: This is my boomstick!

01:24.318 --> 01:26.841
[SPEAKER_21]: Sky Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!

01:27.141 --> 01:30.845
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.

01:30.925 --> 01:33.708
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of warped human being would find that funny?

01:33.949 --> 01:35.230
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio

01:38.183 --> 01:42.366
[SPEAKER_21]: We are live, and this is episode number 43 for May the 4th of 2003.

01:42.466 --> 01:50.052
[SPEAKER_21]: You're tuned into the B-Money Scene's most on-the-move radio station of all things B-Money.

01:50.552 --> 01:52.494
[SPEAKER_21]: My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

01:52.874 --> 01:57.297
[SPEAKER_21]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts, and this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

01:57.337 --> 01:58.518
[SPEAKER_21]: You know her better as Dark Sakura.

01:58.778 --> 01:59.939
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the corner of the couch.

02:00.620 --> 02:01.280
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I register?

02:01.700 --> 02:02.901
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, we can hear you just fine.

02:03.362 --> 02:03.662
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

02:04.227 --> 02:06.228
[SPEAKER_21]: In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

02:06.468 --> 02:09.510
[SPEAKER_20]: This cord is so long, I can broadcast from inside my room.

02:09.530 --> 02:10.331
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just crazy.

02:10.391 --> 02:11.512
[SPEAKER_20]: You can go in the bathroom.

02:12.432 --> 02:14.654
[SPEAKER_20]: I can go all the way into your closet, man.

02:14.674 --> 02:15.194
[SPEAKER_21]: Seriously.

02:15.234 --> 02:16.535
[SPEAKER_21]: Come out of the closet, Loki.

02:16.575 --> 02:17.736
[SPEAKER_21]: Come out of the closet, please.

02:18.916 --> 02:20.457
[SPEAKER_20]: I am broadcasting from inside my room.

02:24.103 --> 02:27.106
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll be talking, we have a brand new setup for Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

02:27.146 --> 02:32.791
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll be talking all about that after this break because I have to go and give Jamie her ferret or she's going to throw a fit.

02:33.572 --> 02:37.796
[SPEAKER_21]: There are no guests in studio yet, but we're hoping that some folks are going to show up.

02:39.797 --> 02:41.939
[SPEAKER_21]: It's kind of a new night for Orange Lounge.

02:42.340 --> 02:45.462
[SPEAKER_21]: We're not quite yet to season three, but changes are slowly happening.

02:45.983 --> 02:48.045
[SPEAKER_21]: So, it'll be interesting for sure.

02:48.880 --> 02:51.964
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll be back after some of our favorite 2DX music.

02:52.164 --> 02:52.705
[SPEAKER_21]: Enjoy!

04:56.897 --> 04:58.358
Thank you for watching!

05:36.557 --> 05:45.821
I just wanna scream it, baby can you hear me, hear me what I'm saying, baby please, put your love, maybe for a moment, maybe for forever, I just wanna hold you, I just wanna know you, tell me that

06:12.056 --> 06:14.740
Thank you for watching.

06:30.905 --> 06:31.846
Thanks for watching!

08:08.922 --> 08:13.064
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

08:13.304 --> 08:15.005
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to be staffed by Hollywood?

08:15.065 --> 08:15.385
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

08:15.545 --> 08:19.186
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we care what people think of us?

08:19.807 --> 08:21.648
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

08:21.668 --> 08:23.108
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

08:23.588 --> 08:24.449
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes!

08:27.655 --> 08:29.497
[SPEAKER_01]: Extreme Bobani Radio.

08:29.737 --> 08:32.560
[SPEAKER_21]: That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

08:33.361 --> 08:41.588
[SPEAKER_21]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio and as promised we're coming to you from our brand new studio which is interesting.

08:42.169 --> 08:47.374
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm hoping by next week we can have the return of the Orange Lounge webcam just so you guys can see what we're dealing with here but...

08:47.634 --> 08:52.479
[SPEAKER_08]: Get a nice one and mount it on the ceiling and have it, like, span across the room.

08:52.580 --> 08:53.200
[SPEAKER_21]: That would be pretty cool.

08:53.220 --> 08:58.666
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, I'm thinking we might be able to mount a webcam somewhere, like, up in there where you could see, like, the whole living room and the back corner.

08:59.467 --> 09:00.168
[SPEAKER_09]: Right in the corner.

09:01.229 --> 09:02.170
[SPEAKER_09]: And see your pink carpet.

09:03.311 --> 09:04.212
[SPEAKER_21]: It's rose, damn it.

09:04.433 --> 09:04.733
[SPEAKER_21]: Pink.

09:05.814 --> 09:21.005
[SPEAKER_21]: for those that don't really follow what's going on in our personal lives which thank you for not stalking us I moved out of my house my old roommate was buying the house and was raising the rent and I'm too poe so I went to get a new place and Loki

09:22.026 --> 09:22.726
[SPEAKER_21]: Wanted a roommate.

09:22.866 --> 09:24.627
[SPEAKER_21]: Wanted to move out of where he was at, too.

09:24.747 --> 09:26.408
[SPEAKER_21]: So we decided to get an apartment together.

09:26.928 --> 09:30.510
[SPEAKER_21]: And now we are in Folsom, California, which is one of the many suburbs of Sacramento.

09:30.830 --> 09:32.210
[SPEAKER_21]: We're in the snooty town.

09:32.230 --> 09:33.131
[SPEAKER_21]: We're in the snooty suburb.

09:33.151 --> 09:35.232
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait till we get to my fuck you of the week.

09:36.632 --> 09:37.153
[SPEAKER_21]: Can't wait.

09:38.693 --> 09:39.614
[SPEAKER_21]: So now we're in Folsom.

09:39.634 --> 09:41.655
[SPEAKER_21]: And this is interesting because Loki and I live together.

09:42.115 --> 09:45.976
[SPEAKER_21]: Now it's not like we really have to be considerate of anyone else during the show.

09:47.017 --> 09:49.038
[SPEAKER_21]: Because Loki and I, being two-thirds of the staff...

09:50.138 --> 09:51.659
[SPEAKER_21]: This show pretty much runs the apartment.

09:52.119 --> 09:57.301
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I mean, yeah, we have to be considerate of the neighbors upstairs and the neighbors next door, as we found out the other day.

09:57.321 --> 10:00.223
[SPEAKER_20]: That was only because we were allowed after 10pm.

10:00.923 --> 10:02.364
[SPEAKER_20]: Before 10pm is fair game.

10:03.044 --> 10:07.326
[SPEAKER_20]: And if they ever complain about us being too loud before 10pm, they can kiss my black ass.

10:07.606 --> 10:07.966
[SPEAKER_20]: Seriously.

10:08.947 --> 10:11.108
[SPEAKER_08]: What, after it gets kicked to that color?

10:12.972 --> 10:15.874
[SPEAKER_21]: Now what's interesting about this new setup is I'm not even looking at the chatroom right now.

10:15.934 --> 10:20.957
[SPEAKER_21]: Our microphone cords are so long that we can just walk to and from the living room.

10:20.997 --> 10:23.699
[SPEAKER_21]: And so we don't really have anyone monitoring the chatroom yet.

10:24.059 --> 10:29.363
[SPEAKER_21]: But I'm hoping that once Intern Zero gets here, maybe he can help us out by monitoring the chatroom.

10:29.403 --> 10:31.124
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe he can tell I'm eating dry ramen.

10:31.144 --> 10:32.325
[SPEAKER_09]: What an appropriate shirt, Rob.

10:32.945 --> 10:33.365
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

10:33.686 --> 10:35.307
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm wearing my Dr. Frankenfurter shirt today.

10:35.867 --> 10:36.227
[SPEAKER_21]: It's lovely.

10:36.247 --> 10:37.748
[SPEAKER_21]: What were you saying, Loki?

10:37.969 --> 10:40.010
[SPEAKER_20]: I said anything I can tell I'm eating dry ramen.

10:40.655 --> 10:41.796
[SPEAKER_21]: You're eating dry ramen.

10:41.816 --> 10:42.797
[SPEAKER_21]: That's got to be nasty.

10:43.037 --> 10:43.858
[SPEAKER_20]: I love this stuff.

10:43.878 --> 10:44.218
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me try.

10:44.238 --> 10:44.858
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to try some.

10:44.878 --> 10:45.719
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm kind of curious.

10:45.739 --> 10:48.101
[SPEAKER_20]: You have to put the chicken seasoning on, because that's awesome.

10:48.221 --> 10:49.662
[SPEAKER_20]: It's really salty and tastes damn good.

10:50.022 --> 10:51.023
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want salty.

10:51.063 --> 10:51.824
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to try some.

10:53.946 --> 10:54.126
[SPEAKER_21]: Ew.

10:55.527 --> 10:56.027
[SPEAKER_21]: It's weird.

10:58.549 --> 10:59.830
[SPEAKER_21]: You are a strange kid, Loki.

11:00.170 --> 11:00.591
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, not bad.

11:01.767 --> 11:04.088
[SPEAKER_21]: So we did get a special guest joining us during that break.

11:04.208 --> 11:05.629
[SPEAKER_21]: Say hello, special guest.

11:06.049 --> 11:07.630
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello, special guest.

11:09.131 --> 11:09.691
[SPEAKER_11]: Smartass.

11:11.112 --> 11:11.852
[SPEAKER_21]: How are you doing, Bradley?

11:12.252 --> 11:13.073
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm doing okay today.

11:14.494 --> 11:17.295
[SPEAKER_21]: A big thank you, by the way, for helping Loki and I move into this place.

11:17.875 --> 11:18.296
[SPEAKER_21]: No problem.

11:18.416 --> 11:21.017
[SPEAKER_21]: What was the nastiest thing you had to move for one of us?

11:21.317 --> 11:22.598
[SPEAKER_21]: The whole underwear.

11:25.421 --> 11:25.722
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

11:27.102 --> 11:28.863
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe some old boxes of stuff.

11:28.923 --> 11:29.443
[SPEAKER_18]: Old boxes.

11:29.943 --> 11:30.563
[SPEAKER_18]: Old boxes of stuff.

11:31.284 --> 11:31.844
[SPEAKER_21]: My Pikachu.

11:32.484 --> 11:33.504
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, my Pikachu.

11:33.524 --> 11:34.365
[SPEAKER_21]: That was the scariest thing.

11:34.645 --> 11:35.885
[SPEAKER_21]: Bradley had to move.

11:36.886 --> 11:38.586
[SPEAKER_21]: What's interesting now is that we have a kitchen.

11:39.927 --> 11:47.970
[SPEAKER_21]: Because the way our apartment is, the kitchen is literally right next to the workstations and our living room.

11:48.250 --> 11:51.151
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't wait until we get the webcam so we can show all you guys this.

11:51.631 --> 11:56.655
[SPEAKER_21]: But you might hear Jamie kind of running back and forth to the kitchen, hurry up and cook, Popeye, and things like that.

11:57.596 --> 12:00.779
[SPEAKER_20]: I can watch Simpsons while doing a show.

12:00.899 --> 12:01.319
[SPEAKER_20]: The best.

12:02.060 --> 12:03.541
[SPEAKER_20]: Best ever.

12:03.561 --> 12:05.923
[SPEAKER_21]: But you'd be too easily distracted, Mr. Loki.

12:06.583 --> 12:08.825
[SPEAKER_21]: So?

12:08.885 --> 12:09.666
[SPEAKER_18]: That'll ruin any show.

12:12.071 --> 12:16.934
[SPEAKER_21]: But what is interesting is that now we're sitting here in the living room, we can fire up the PlayStation and play whatever games are new.

12:17.315 --> 12:19.336
[SPEAKER_21]: For instance, if we wanted to, we could fire up Max 2.

12:19.596 --> 12:20.917
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, if I didn't already outplay it.

12:21.097 --> 12:22.198
[SPEAKER_21]: If you didn't already outplay it.

12:22.258 --> 12:23.559
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie, have you even seen Max 2 yet?

12:25.140 --> 12:25.520
[SPEAKER_21]: Who cares?

12:26.401 --> 12:28.262
[SPEAKER_21]: I have it too, so I've played it all too.

12:28.282 --> 12:30.304
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you have your mic over there, Jamie?

12:32.085 --> 12:33.286
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie doesn't care she doesn't have a mic.

12:35.422 --> 12:35.662
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

12:35.902 --> 12:36.963
[SPEAKER_18]: I bought Max 2 also.

12:37.043 --> 12:37.903
[SPEAKER_18]: What did you think of Max 2?

12:37.943 --> 12:38.944
[SPEAKER_18]: It was pretty good.

12:40.565 --> 12:42.706
[SPEAKER_18]: There's lots of songs.

12:43.526 --> 12:46.608
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to get Kingdom Hearts Final Mix before I get Max 2.

12:48.069 --> 12:48.269
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.338
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie, you need to keep that microphone.

12:51.378 --> 12:52.739
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh wait, no, I see Bradley has it.

12:52.759 --> 12:54.500
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why you don't have it.

12:55.921 --> 12:58.242
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie's playing with the chat room.

12:58.262 --> 13:00.223
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, let's talk to Bradley about Max 2.

13:00.504 --> 13:00.844
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry.

13:01.704 --> 13:03.406
[SPEAKER_18]: There's lots of songs like 70-something.

13:03.846 --> 13:05.627
[SPEAKER_18]: Because a lot of them are the Oni songs.

13:05.647 --> 13:09.930
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to actually play them in an Oni before you can unlock them for regular play.

13:09.990 --> 13:13.312
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you hear about the really cheap trick you can use to unlock all the Oni songs really fast?

13:14.196 --> 13:14.616
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I didn't.

13:14.917 --> 13:18.019
[SPEAKER_21]: All you do, you go into Create Your Own Oni Course, right?

13:18.199 --> 13:18.379
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

13:18.439 --> 13:20.240
[SPEAKER_21]: And you set all your songs to roulette.

13:20.660 --> 13:30.566
[SPEAKER_21]: And then the steps, because you can set the level of steps you'll get on roulette, basic, middle, or basic trick, maniac, light, standard, heavy, whatever it is.

13:30.666 --> 13:31.367
[SPEAKER_21]: Challenge, yeah.

13:32.227 --> 13:33.088
[SPEAKER_21]: I hate how they change that.

13:33.108 --> 13:34.909
[SPEAKER_21]: They will forever be trick and maniac to me, damn it.

13:35.129 --> 13:38.131
[SPEAKER_21]: You set them all to challenge, and then that way you'll only get the challenge songs.

13:38.451 --> 13:42.754
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, yeah, they're forever going to be, you know, SSR and whatever.

13:42.774 --> 13:43.114
[SPEAKER_21]: Whatever.

13:44.675 --> 13:46.856
[SPEAKER_21]: No one can hear that over here.

13:47.656 --> 13:56.400
[SPEAKER_21]: You put it on light, and then you can... So you can put all your songs on, like, 1.5 speed solo light challenge mode, and you'll have all your challenge songs in, like, under an hour.

13:56.881 --> 13:57.361
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's easy.

13:57.801 --> 13:58.041
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah.

13:58.541 --> 14:00.603
[SPEAKER_21]: That was the only way... You did the hard way.

14:00.623 --> 14:01.263
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you get them all?

14:01.583 --> 14:01.703
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

14:01.923 --> 14:02.323
[SPEAKER_21]: Dang.

14:07.166 --> 14:08.126
[SPEAKER_21]: Dropout, right?

14:08.787 --> 14:09.007
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought...

14:13.929 --> 14:14.950
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, because it's the first stage.

14:20.497 --> 14:20.797
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, okay.

14:20.937 --> 14:22.279
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, that's kind of the same idea.

14:22.759 --> 14:23.901
[SPEAKER_20]: Random course is evil.

14:24.281 --> 14:25.503
[SPEAKER_21]: Random course is evil.

14:28.337 --> 14:39.763
[SPEAKER_21]: It's an interesting feature to add to DDR, though, where you can... Basically, the random-owning course now selects any song at random, any difficulty, well, pretty much only Trick and Maniac are the only ones that... I don't know, what did you get that one to?

14:39.783 --> 14:40.783
[SPEAKER_20]: You got, uh, what was it?

14:40.843 --> 14:42.004
[SPEAKER_20]: Burning Heat Heavy 8-Speed.

14:42.124 --> 14:45.726
[SPEAKER_21]: I got Burning Heat Heavy 8-Speed Boost.

14:46.566 --> 14:47.407
[SPEAKER_21]: I was so pissed.

14:54.494 --> 15:02.856
[SPEAKER_21]: And then, of course, we have beaten the course, or I should say Brad did, because Brad was over here, and he played the course, and he was getting four, oh wait, how many songs did he have to play?

15:02.896 --> 15:03.496
[SPEAKER_21]: Five or six?

15:03.536 --> 15:03.856
[SPEAKER_21]: I forget.

15:03.876 --> 15:04.456
[SPEAKER_21]: I think six.

15:04.816 --> 15:06.757
[SPEAKER_21]: Four of them were standard songs.

15:07.737 --> 15:11.218
[SPEAKER_21]: And, like, the hardest modifier he got was Sudden on one of the standard songs.

15:11.318 --> 15:12.818
[SPEAKER_21]: He got a Sudden on one of the standard songs.

15:13.118 --> 15:17.619
[SPEAKER_21]: And the rest was like, ooh, you know, it was like, ooh, I might have to play Two Speed or something.

15:17.639 --> 15:18.520
[SPEAKER_21]: It was sick.

15:18.980 --> 15:19.720
[SPEAKER_21]: He makes me mad.

15:21.372 --> 15:27.835
[SPEAKER_17]: I had five pretty regular ones, and then the last one was the AM3P Remix.

15:27.935 --> 15:30.776
[SPEAKER_17]: It was like 3x, thin, reverse, less flat, or combination.

15:42.043 --> 15:47.805
[SPEAKER_21]: I find what I like most about, um, it's just weird that the sound just changed right there.

15:49.486 --> 15:51.767
[SPEAKER_21]: Are we still, hold on, I'm gonna make sure we're still going.

15:53.407 --> 15:54.287
[SPEAKER_21]: Something got unplugged.

15:56.668 --> 15:56.968
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello?

15:57.068 --> 15:57.309
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello?

15:57.409 --> 15:58.309
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, they can still hear us.

15:59.209 --> 16:00.390
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, but it got louder all of a sudden.

16:00.490 --> 16:03.991
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I don't know what happened.

16:04.071 --> 16:04.651
[SPEAKER_21]: We got louder.

16:05.031 --> 16:05.291
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh well.

16:07.032 --> 16:08.332
[SPEAKER_20]: Normally it means something got unplugged.

16:08.953 --> 16:09.593
[SPEAKER_20]: How you doing, Bradley?

16:09.613 --> 16:09.753
[SPEAKER_20]: Bradley?

16:11.804 --> 16:12.385
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll fix it.

16:12.405 --> 16:12.866
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you hear me?

16:13.227 --> 16:17.556
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we can hear everybody, so... Hello, anyone out there?

16:17.696 --> 16:18.197
[SPEAKER_21]: That was weird.

16:18.417 --> 16:19.039
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, whatever.

16:20.502 --> 16:21.303
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, where were we?

16:22.119 --> 16:25.441
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, you're talking about Max 2 for Japanese system.

16:26.522 --> 16:31.845
[SPEAKER_21]: I think, I actually, what I like most about Max 2 is, like, I like those Oni course songs.

16:31.965 --> 16:35.148
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, they're, it's kind of neat to be able to play them at home whenever you want.

16:35.988 --> 16:40.131
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I was playing a lot of those on Extreme, and now I can play them at home.

16:40.551 --> 16:43.073
[SPEAKER_21]: But what sucks is that they didn't add any new steps to them.

16:43.793 --> 16:44.934
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just the challenge steps.

16:45.333 --> 16:46.474
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

17:08.703 --> 17:10.404
[SPEAKER_20]: They've gotten licensed songs from the get-go.

17:10.564 --> 17:11.965
[SPEAKER_20]: We've gotten fucked every single time.

17:12.806 --> 17:16.848
[SPEAKER_20]: Except for Max USA, and they're like, oh, here you go, licensed songs.

17:17.128 --> 17:18.089
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, gee, it's about time.

17:18.129 --> 17:19.750
[SPEAKER_20]: You're only like, you know, two mixes behind.

17:20.851 --> 17:27.035
[SPEAKER_21]: What's going to be interesting, though, is the news, and that'll be a big show when we hear when B3's over, what comes out of that.

17:28.155 --> 17:29.316
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, that is a microphone, Jamie.

17:29.476 --> 17:30.357
[SPEAKER_21]: You like that one, don't you?

17:32.038 --> 17:33.079
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a condenser mic.

17:33.319 --> 17:34.299
[SPEAKER_20]: I just need a mic sting.

17:35.080 --> 17:37.301
[SPEAKER_20]: That's going to be the one that's going to record background noise.

17:37.902 --> 17:38.282
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, goody.

17:42.273 --> 17:44.695
[SPEAKER_21]: Hmm.

17:45.596 --> 17:47.577
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie's getting all angsty over her pot pie.

17:49.939 --> 17:50.659
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki, what are you doing?

17:51.800 --> 17:52.761
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm seeing this on TV.

17:52.781 --> 17:54.602
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to turn on the TV during the show?

17:55.503 --> 17:55.963
[SPEAKER_21]: Hell yeah.

17:56.424 --> 17:59.006
[SPEAKER_21]: You need to get a VCR so you don't get so easily distracted.

18:00.947 --> 18:02.108
[SPEAKER_21]: You're watching The Weakest Link.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.152
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you guys forget we do a radio show Sunday nights?

18:07.172 --> 18:07.232
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

18:11.414 --> 18:12.654
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm turning the channel.

18:12.674 --> 18:15.315
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to go back to... Why are we watching Game Show Network?

18:15.475 --> 18:16.655
[SPEAKER_21]: I was watching the Game Show Network.

18:16.675 --> 18:18.215
[SPEAKER_21]: I was watching $100,000 Pyramid.

18:18.455 --> 18:19.976
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, I saw the coolest game.

18:20.096 --> 18:20.316
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

18:20.736 --> 18:22.016
[SPEAKER_08]: Who Wants to Beat Up a Millionaire.

18:22.896 --> 18:25.077
[SPEAKER_21]: On Dreamcast.

18:25.237 --> 18:26.157
[SPEAKER_21]: That's hella old.

18:26.197 --> 18:27.677
[SPEAKER_21]: That was like an old, old Dreamcast game.

18:27.697 --> 18:29.577
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but I didn't pay attention to the crap games.

18:30.578 --> 18:31.198
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you buy it?

18:31.418 --> 18:31.698
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

18:32.238 --> 18:32.878
[SPEAKER_08]: Ross is playing it.

18:34.238 --> 18:34.978
[SPEAKER_21]: How does it work?

18:35.718 --> 18:38.219
[SPEAKER_08]: Your question right, you get to beat up a millionaire for money.

18:41.585 --> 18:43.646
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki's trying to figure out how to use digital cable right now.

18:43.666 --> 18:45.246
[SPEAKER_21]: We're stuck on the weakest link right now.

18:45.266 --> 18:46.106
[SPEAKER_20]: When are you getting TiVo?

18:46.126 --> 18:47.087
[SPEAKER_21]: So slow.

18:47.107 --> 18:49.427
[SPEAKER_21]: We're getting TiVo when I'm not ghetto poor anymore, Jamie.

18:50.908 --> 18:51.388
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, 5-5?

18:51.648 --> 18:56.770
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean... I know how to do this.

18:57.970 --> 18:58.230
[SPEAKER_20]: Shut up.

18:58.810 --> 19:02.812
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, so... This is an interesting perspective here.

19:03.512 --> 19:03.892
[SPEAKER_21]: How so?

19:04.192 --> 19:06.033
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in front of the computer this time.

19:06.113 --> 19:07.613
[SPEAKER_20]: I think this is the A-team.

19:08.373 --> 19:09.214
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoa, the A-team is cool.

19:09.254 --> 19:10.634
[SPEAKER_21]: No, it's Thunderball, uncut.

19:11.229 --> 19:11.349
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh.

19:11.949 --> 19:14.750
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you turn it down for us or mute it until your show's on or whatever?

19:15.451 --> 19:16.411
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't want to watch this anyways.

19:16.471 --> 19:18.652
[SPEAKER_20]: I thought that most extreme elimination challenge is going to be on.

19:18.772 --> 19:19.132
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck this.

19:21.273 --> 19:22.414
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you want to put in Max 2?

19:22.474 --> 19:23.954
[SPEAKER_21]: We can play a little Max 2 on air.

19:25.155 --> 19:26.415
[SPEAKER_21]: Show off our new equipment.

19:26.435 --> 19:30.117
[SPEAKER_08]: See, that's really going to do good for the listeners because they can just hear the music.

19:30.137 --> 19:33.138
[SPEAKER_08]: And hear, oh, you're doing shitty.

19:34.465 --> 19:35.305
[SPEAKER_20]: Whoa, another AAA.

19:35.326 --> 19:37.807
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't you try practicing in a closet?

19:38.087 --> 19:39.028
[SPEAKER_20]: I just kick ass.

19:39.088 --> 19:40.348
[SPEAKER_20]: Another AAA again?

19:40.468 --> 19:41.129
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh my god.

19:41.849 --> 19:42.730
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm gonna do this blindfold.

19:42.790 --> 19:43.890
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, look, another AAA.

19:44.611 --> 19:45.051
[SPEAKER_20]: Come on.

19:45.091 --> 19:46.392
[SPEAKER_08]: What the fuck is this?

19:47.733 --> 19:49.694
[SPEAKER_09]: Ghost in the Shell movie CD?

19:53.356 --> 20:02.741
[SPEAKER_21]: Remember, like, before CDs, when they used to sell, like, movie CDs at CompUSA, where you could, like, it was on, like, two CDs, and it was just basically one giant AVI file or something?

20:02.761 --> 20:03.522
[SPEAKER_08]: You mean it's a VCD.

20:04.358 --> 20:05.939
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, there's Final Fuck X.

20:27.822 --> 20:28.923
[SPEAKER_07]: I burned that for you.

20:29.423 --> 20:30.404
[SPEAKER_21]: All the porn's behind me.

20:31.245 --> 20:33.106
[SPEAKER_21]: Should we look through some of Loki's interesting porn?

20:33.586 --> 20:34.567
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, let's watch porn.

20:34.787 --> 20:35.888
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you want to put on some porn?

20:36.229 --> 20:36.609
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, why not?

20:36.669 --> 20:37.630
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to watch something funny.

20:39.131 --> 20:39.871
[SPEAKER_09]: I need comedy.

20:40.091 --> 20:42.693
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's go back to the Orange Lounge Radio roots and watch some porn.

20:45.335 --> 20:46.076
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, it's comedy.

20:46.096 --> 20:46.536
[SPEAKER_21]: This is great.

20:46.777 --> 20:47.957
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm loving this new facility.

20:48.278 --> 20:50.039
[SPEAKER_21]: Now we don't just have to talk about porn.

20:50.419 --> 20:51.420
[SPEAKER_21]: We can watch porn.

21:00.449 --> 21:01.309
[SPEAKER_08]: Jackal and Hyde.

21:02.430 --> 21:05.330
[SPEAKER_21]: Wait, let's talk, let's take a chat room vote.

21:05.530 --> 21:06.411
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie, can you monitor the chat room?

21:06.431 --> 21:07.631
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you have the bad anime one.

21:08.291 --> 21:10.851
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you monitor the chat room, Jamie, and see which one of these they want to watch?

21:10.871 --> 21:13.592
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'm just going to go by based on biggest response.

21:13.612 --> 21:14.492
[SPEAKER_08]: Hand me that big stack.

21:14.592 --> 21:16.893
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, let me... Loki, hand me your big stack.

21:19.413 --> 21:20.414
[SPEAKER_18]: Stack overflow.

21:22.554 --> 21:24.454
[SPEAKER_21]: We have The Watcher 3.

21:25.595 --> 21:27.175
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, it's Mirage's first anal.

21:28.547 --> 21:32.790
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see, we have DNA Hunter, Volume 1, totally uncensored.

21:32.830 --> 21:35.812
[SPEAKER_21]: This is animated, but it's voiced by adult stars.

21:37.234 --> 21:40.896
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, chat room, since there's a little lag, you're going to have to type the name of the porno that you want to see.

21:41.497 --> 21:42.538
[SPEAKER_21]: Really loud, so Jamie sees.

21:42.758 --> 21:43.578
[SPEAKER_21]: This one's lame.

21:44.039 --> 21:46.140
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, it's Jenna Jameson in Cruise in Jennaville.

21:46.400 --> 21:47.081
[SPEAKER_21]: It kind of looks lame.

21:47.161 --> 21:50.223
[SPEAKER_20]: It's one of those stupid softcore, like, I'm getting naked and touching myself things.

21:50.644 --> 21:51.344
[SPEAKER_20]: Really retarded.

21:52.225 --> 21:53.326
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't have any gay porn, huh?

21:53.886 --> 21:54.467
[SPEAKER_21]: I used to.

21:54.487 --> 21:56.148
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I have that one you gave me in my trunk.

21:57.879 --> 22:00.301
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, that's right, there's a gay porn out, yeah, in the trunk.

22:01.001 --> 22:03.723
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so we have, we have a random gay porn we can watch, too.

22:05.184 --> 22:06.004
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, let's see, what's this?

22:06.745 --> 22:08.786
[SPEAKER_21]: Karen, totally uncensored.

22:08.806 --> 22:10.547
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, you think this show's gone to the toilet?

22:10.587 --> 22:11.528
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we don't care what you think.

22:13.409 --> 22:16.290
[SPEAKER_21]: Jekyll and Hyde, with multiple angles.

22:17.251 --> 22:17.431
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh!

22:17.491 --> 22:18.132
[SPEAKER_20]: Multiple angles.

22:19.032 --> 22:19.452
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see.

22:20.133 --> 22:22.194
[SPEAKER_21]: Real wild girls out of control.

22:22.234 --> 22:23.615
[SPEAKER_20]: Gravitation is not porn.

22:23.635 --> 22:25.676
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the Winter Ghetto version of Girls Gone Wild.

22:25.876 --> 22:26.817
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just horrible.

22:29.215 --> 22:29.955
[SPEAKER_20]: That's actually pretty good.

22:29.995 --> 22:30.935
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think there's anything in there.

22:31.015 --> 22:32.036
[SPEAKER_21]: No, there is.

22:32.776 --> 22:33.636
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a Playboy disc.

22:33.836 --> 22:37.517
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there isn't anything in there.

22:37.697 --> 22:40.497
[SPEAKER_21]: Instead of Sailor Moon, it's Sailor and the Seven Balls.

22:41.018 --> 22:44.498
[SPEAKER_20]: Awful, awful, awful animation.

22:44.598 --> 22:45.078
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm curious.

22:45.098 --> 22:45.698
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me see that.

22:47.199 --> 22:47.899
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me borrow that.

22:48.719 --> 22:51.160
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to see how bad it is.

22:51.800 --> 22:52.880
[SPEAKER_21]: Sex and the Stranger.

22:57.071 --> 22:58.457
[SPEAKER_20]: Also, some of them have two DVDs.

22:58.538 --> 23:00.566
[SPEAKER_09]: Never mind, this looks really stupid.

23:00.707 --> 23:01.209
[SPEAKER_09]: Couples.

23:02.239 --> 23:03.460
[SPEAKER_09]: This looks more than stupid.

23:03.800 --> 23:04.360
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Treasure Hunt.

23:04.380 --> 23:06.002
[SPEAKER_07]: This looks like it was done in Flash.

23:06.562 --> 23:07.803
[SPEAKER_20]: That was done in Flash.

23:08.083 --> 23:10.485
[SPEAKER_21]: It's an erotic paradise and ten million dollars.

23:10.985 --> 23:13.086
[SPEAKER_21]: Only one catch, you gotta live to collect.

23:13.427 --> 23:15.928
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's like porn and they beat each other up.

23:15.948 --> 23:18.510
[SPEAKER_20]: No one wants to see this either, it's softcore crap.

23:18.530 --> 23:20.051
[SPEAKER_20]: I just kind of put them all.

23:20.191 --> 23:22.393
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, the rest is, oh, no, it's softcore too.

23:23.413 --> 23:25.635
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, the rest is good.

23:25.775 --> 23:27.196
[SPEAKER_21]: A Heat for All Seasons.

23:27.436 --> 23:30.218
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a fairly popular hentai, if I'm not mistaken.

23:33.128 --> 23:38.413
[SPEAKER_21]: Nubian Nurse Orgy Nubian?

23:39.294 --> 23:40.274
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I think that wins.

23:40.815 --> 23:43.297
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so we have Nubian Nurse Orgy in the lead.

23:44.358 --> 23:45.459
[SPEAKER_21]: Hurry up, because I'm bored.

23:46.460 --> 23:47.901
[SPEAKER_21]: Interactive Mind Teaser.

23:48.001 --> 23:48.661
[SPEAKER_21]: That sounds stupid.

23:48.681 --> 23:49.302
[SPEAKER_20]: That's an actual game.

23:49.322 --> 23:51.264
[SPEAKER_20]: You have to do work to get naked pictures in that one.

23:51.304 --> 23:52.805
[SPEAKER_21]: Ooh, and then Seven Deadly Sins.

23:53.706 --> 23:54.266
[SPEAKER_20]: That one's funny.

23:55.787 --> 23:57.389
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, we're going to watch Nubian Nurse Orgy.

23:57.429 --> 23:58.610
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't care what the chatroom thinks.

23:58.630 --> 24:00.572
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

24:02.375 --> 24:03.196
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, then they lose.

24:04.337 --> 24:05.958
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, we don't have a DVD player hooked up, do we?

24:07.499 --> 24:08.560
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, we'll have to get that.

24:08.620 --> 24:12.864
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, that'll be something we can look forward to after the break then, is Nubian Nurse Orgy.

24:13.684 --> 24:13.865
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

24:26.118 --> 24:28.499
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, we have a stand-alone DVD player somewhere.

24:28.540 --> 24:29.500
[SPEAKER_21]: At least I had one the other day.

24:30.941 --> 24:31.521
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you find it?

24:33.002 --> 24:33.202
[SPEAKER_21]: Good.

24:33.382 --> 24:34.123
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a DVD player.

24:34.683 --> 24:36.364
[SPEAKER_21]: So we have that to look for.

24:36.424 --> 24:38.665
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, the carpeting in here is pink.

24:38.746 --> 24:39.406
[SPEAKER_21]: Isn't it lovely?

24:45.690 --> 24:50.112
[SPEAKER_21]: So, Jamie, you bought yourself a book the other day.

24:50.492 --> 24:51.073
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I did.

24:51.213 --> 24:51.793
[SPEAKER_21]: What did you buy?

24:52.193 --> 24:52.934
[SPEAKER_21]: Battle Royale.

24:53.394 --> 24:54.055
[SPEAKER_21]: It's about time.

24:54.155 --> 24:54.555
[SPEAKER_21]: How is it?

24:55.439 --> 24:57.860
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I bought it two days ago.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.162
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is just reading it in the bathroom.

25:02.442 --> 25:04.123
[SPEAKER_21]: So you're about a quarter of the way, about?

25:04.943 --> 25:06.084
[SPEAKER_21]: No, maybe about a fifth.

25:06.104 --> 25:07.204
[SPEAKER_21]: How many kids are still alive?

25:08.585 --> 25:08.945
[SPEAKER_21]: Girl, hold on.

25:11.586 --> 25:13.007
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the chapter's in with the body count.

25:13.487 --> 25:14.428
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, 30 students removed.

25:15.828 --> 25:17.549
[SPEAKER_21]: So, a quarter of them are down, basically.

25:17.569 --> 25:18.650
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

25:18.670 --> 25:18.910
[SPEAKER_21]: Nice.

25:22.991 --> 25:23.912
Oh my god, the best.

25:25.031 --> 25:31.693
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

25:35.794 --> 25:36.054
[SPEAKER_21]: Hmm.

25:37.054 --> 25:37.615
[SPEAKER_21]: Kind of gross.

25:37.815 --> 25:38.975
[SPEAKER_08]: And they all eat the cookies.

25:41.056 --> 25:42.456
[SPEAKER_08]: Shuya got to have the cookies.

25:46.437 --> 25:48.578
[SPEAKER_21]: Anything else going on in the Bomani world, Loki?

25:48.618 --> 25:50.258
[SPEAKER_21]: What's new in Sim Land?

25:50.858 --> 25:51.718
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there anything new in Sim Land?

25:51.738 --> 25:53.599
[SPEAKER_07]: Let him hook up the DVD player first.

25:55.171 --> 25:55.993
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeez, Rob.

25:56.594 --> 25:56.994
[SPEAKER_21]: Jeez.

25:57.074 --> 25:57.896
[SPEAKER_07]: Crack that whip.

25:58.457 --> 26:01.643
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, I forgot for a minute that we're not a Bomani show.

26:03.673 --> 26:05.314
[SPEAKER_08]: I have something new in the Bitmoney world.

26:05.574 --> 26:05.774
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

26:06.054 --> 26:07.734
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't played any Bitmoney in a week.

26:09.375 --> 26:10.215
[SPEAKER_21]: Congratulations.

26:10.235 --> 26:10.856
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I played 2DX.

26:10.876 --> 26:11.656
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you?

26:11.956 --> 26:13.837
[SPEAKER_08]: You saw me beat Last Message twice in a row.

26:13.857 --> 26:14.097
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

26:14.137 --> 26:15.297
[SPEAKER_21]: You're beating Seven Stars now.

26:15.697 --> 26:15.977
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

26:16.057 --> 26:17.058
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you beat another one, too?

26:17.078 --> 26:17.118
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

26:17.538 --> 26:18.558
[SPEAKER_08]: You beat Please Don't Go, right?

26:18.578 --> 26:19.058
[SPEAKER_08]: I beat Please Don't Go.

26:19.078 --> 26:19.799
[SPEAKER_08]: That was my first one.

26:19.819 --> 26:20.919
[SPEAKER_08]: My second one was Monkey Dance.

26:21.479 --> 26:21.859
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

26:22.139 --> 26:26.461
[SPEAKER_08]: I've beaten Nine O'Clocks, but it was on Easy, and I border bonused, so it doesn't count.

26:26.581 --> 26:27.001
[SPEAKER_21]: Doesn't count.

26:28.962 --> 26:29.202
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

26:29.964 --> 26:32.486
[SPEAKER_08]: I've sort of... I haven't been... You know, it's weird.

26:32.546 --> 26:36.348
[SPEAKER_21]: It's hard to get back into the swing of things right now because I honestly feel like we haven't done a show in a month.

26:36.748 --> 26:40.671
[SPEAKER_21]: And then to come back and do a show here, like at a brand new place, it's weird.

26:40.731 --> 26:44.053
[SPEAKER_21]: It doesn't even... It doesn't feel... It doesn't... Yeah, it doesn't feel serious right now.

26:44.093 --> 26:49.696
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe it's going to take us until our... until our Season 3 premiere, until we feel serious.

26:54.819 --> 26:55.439
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, that's right.

26:55.480 --> 26:59.442
[SPEAKER_21]: We now... I remember that.

27:07.343 --> 27:14.845
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I remember I used to have those little Sesame Street books, and I would get the little records, and you could play on the record player, and it would go, and now, turn the page.

27:15.146 --> 27:16.846
[SPEAKER_21]: And it made the little chime, and you could turn the page.

27:17.006 --> 27:17.226
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

27:18.527 --> 27:19.447
[SPEAKER_18]: I had Garfield ones.

27:19.487 --> 27:19.907
[SPEAKER_18]: Those were cool.

27:19.927 --> 27:29.511
[SPEAKER_18]: And the hardest one to find was...

27:31.994 --> 27:33.415
[SPEAKER_21]: We might want to pull the blinds.

27:35.897 --> 27:37.979
[SPEAKER_21]: Because that's the last thing we need are more complaints.

27:43.184 --> 27:45.686
[SPEAKER_21]: Now they're going to wonder what we do in here.

27:54.594 --> 27:55.214
[SPEAKER_21]: Porn is funny.

27:55.394 --> 27:56.375
[SPEAKER_09]: Porn is comedy.

27:56.555 --> 27:58.317
[SPEAKER_21]: Wait, so are we going to take a break and then do porn?

27:58.337 --> 27:59.578
[SPEAKER_09]: They said turn on the freaking mic.

28:00.322 --> 28:03.403
[SPEAKER_21]: The mics are on.

28:03.963 --> 28:04.523
[SPEAKER_21]: Watch our audio.

28:04.563 --> 28:05.624
[SPEAKER_21]: Make sure we have audio going out.

28:07.565 --> 28:08.485
[SPEAKER_07]: La, la, la.

28:08.805 --> 28:10.546
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we freaking have them on.

28:16.668 --> 28:17.988
[SPEAKER_21]: They keep cutting out or something?

28:18.008 --> 28:20.269
[SPEAKER_21]: Bring up the studio broadcaster.

28:25.006 --> 28:28.789
[SPEAKER_21]: and then when you just keep an eye on that and make sure we don't drop.

28:30.070 --> 28:32.612
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this one is unconnected at the bottom.

28:32.992 --> 28:34.894
[SPEAKER_08]: It's unconnecting.

28:37.196 --> 28:39.177
[SPEAKER_20]: That explains why our volume keeps jumping.

28:40.838 --> 28:41.679
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, just one sec.

28:41.719 --> 28:42.119
[SPEAKER_20]: No one talk.

28:53.709 --> 28:54.129
[SPEAKER_20]: Dead air.

28:57.895 --> 28:58.295
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.

28:58.696 --> 28:59.016
[SPEAKER_20]: Hello.

28:59.496 --> 29:00.137
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, we're good.

29:03.839 --> 29:04.540
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, maybe not.

29:08.443 --> 29:11.145
[SPEAKER_21]: Boy, this is the greatest episode of Orange Lounge Radio ever.

29:16.669 --> 29:25.796
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, well, I still see that we're getting... I have to check on your pot pie?

29:25.956 --> 29:26.236
[SPEAKER_21]: Fine.

29:27.642 --> 29:37.709
[SPEAKER_21]: Your pot pie has... Maybe we should go to music.

29:38.629 --> 29:39.910
[SPEAKER_21]: 15 minutes for your pot pie.

29:40.991 --> 29:43.312
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, let's go to music right now.

29:43.433 --> 29:44.413
[SPEAKER_21]: Now's a good time to break.

29:52.058 --> 29:52.639
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, what?

29:52.679 --> 29:53.479
[SPEAKER_21]: What do you want me to say?

29:57.102 --> 29:57.382
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi.

29:58.584 --> 29:58.644
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi.

29:58.744 --> 30:01.566
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello, hello, hello, hello.

30:01.586 --> 30:06.269
[SPEAKER_21]: You gotta go to C, C colon, and then Orange Lounge.

30:06.289 --> 30:07.670
[SPEAKER_18]: Echo, echo.

30:12.119 --> 30:12.659
[SPEAKER_21]: B3?

30:13.260 --> 30:15.801
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah, B3's coming up, that'll be fun, that's in two weeks.

30:16.141 --> 30:30.127
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, we have, this weekend is episode 43, next weekend's episode 44, then we have the week after that, the 17th and the 18th, we have B3, which is this huge tournament that's happening at the Riptide Arcade in San Francisco, which I went to for the first time this week, by the way.

30:30.867 --> 30:32.208
[SPEAKER_21]: It's pretty nifty.

30:32.368 --> 30:37.610
[SPEAKER_21]: If I remember right, a lot of the flooring is wood, so it feels like you're playing video games on a pier, so it's interesting.

30:38.731 --> 30:40.952
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, because you are, because you're on the pier and playing an arcade, but...

30:42.691 --> 30:48.515
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, about four songs.

30:48.795 --> 30:54.019
[SPEAKER_21]: So we have B3 and we're going to be broadcasting live from B3 all day long, Saturday and Sunday.

30:54.840 --> 30:57.602
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you think this is interesting radio, wait till you hear that.

30:58.522 --> 31:03.185
[SPEAKER_21]: Hopefully you guys were listening during our March Madness broadcast or if you remember way back to the Shaft broadcast.

31:05.127 --> 31:08.749
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll talk more about B3 and all that after the break when we get some more mics hooked up.

31:08.829 --> 31:09.470
[SPEAKER_21]: So we'll be back.

32:18.785 --> 32:20.128
Thanks for watching!

36:10.491 --> 36:11.835
Thanks for watching!

37:10.280 --> 37:15.723
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio with the Ping Pong Balls.

37:19.385 --> 37:20.486
[SPEAKER_21]: We're back.

37:21.547 --> 37:22.988
[SPEAKER_21]: And you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

37:23.528 --> 37:26.550
[SPEAKER_08]: I felt the urge to do that brand dance.

37:27.110 --> 37:27.750
[SPEAKER_21]: The brand dance?

37:27.770 --> 37:28.071
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

37:28.711 --> 37:29.391
[SPEAKER_21]: During Night in Motion?

37:29.612 --> 37:29.872
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

37:30.732 --> 37:31.533
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

37:31.793 --> 37:34.354
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess many people probably don't get that.

37:35.515 --> 37:36.456
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you tell the story then?

37:36.476 --> 37:36.916
[SPEAKER_21]: I wasn't there.

37:36.936 --> 37:38.217
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what I was doing.

37:40.661 --> 37:45.324
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember, though, everyone at AX 2001, I think it was.

37:46.705 --> 37:47.385
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a tournament.

37:47.585 --> 37:48.846
[SPEAKER_08]: See, I wasn't there for the tournament either.

37:48.886 --> 37:49.927
[SPEAKER_08]: I just decided not to do it.

37:50.407 --> 37:55.070
[SPEAKER_08]: But everyone for freestyle for the post-qualifiers got up there and did Night in Motion.

37:55.991 --> 37:56.591
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody did.

37:57.592 --> 37:58.492
[SPEAKER_08]: Got up there and did Night in Motion.

38:00.333 --> 38:00.594
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

38:02.194 --> 38:04.156
[SPEAKER_08]: My pot pie is taunting me.

38:06.297 --> 38:07.718
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob's tweaking with a thingy.

38:09.144 --> 38:09.604
[SPEAKER_08]: He's pinching it.

38:09.624 --> 38:10.925
[SPEAKER_21]: He's trying to make one of the mics a little louder.

38:10.945 --> 38:12.086
[SPEAKER_08]: He's trying to make it get decided.

38:14.787 --> 38:15.768
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need to be loud!

38:15.788 --> 38:23.212
[SPEAKER_07]: See, Rob needs the one where he needs to have his volume down.

38:23.232 --> 38:24.193
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you need to turn mine down.

38:25.394 --> 38:26.354
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a voice that carries.

38:29.456 --> 38:33.458
[SPEAKER_21]: So, hey, Loki reminded me during the break of a Bomani topic.

38:33.779 --> 38:35.960
[SPEAKER_21]: You remember how DDR's coming out for the Xbox?

38:35.980 --> 38:36.060
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

38:37.259 --> 38:38.140
[SPEAKER_08]: You mean that bullshit?

38:38.240 --> 38:43.625
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, well, they have the first screenshot out now, and it looks like Drop the Bomb is going to be in it.

38:44.185 --> 38:45.386
[SPEAKER_08]: I still think that's bullshit.

38:46.227 --> 38:46.908
[SPEAKER_21]: How's it bullshit?

38:47.488 --> 38:49.770
[SPEAKER_08]: I still think that it's a big bullshit hoax.

38:51.271 --> 38:52.392
[SPEAKER_21]: You think DDR on X?

38:54.014 --> 38:54.995
[SPEAKER_21]: What are you doing, Loki?

38:55.635 --> 38:56.896
[SPEAKER_20]: I was getting on my internet.

38:57.257 --> 39:00.399
[SPEAKER_20]: I forgot that the sound from mine... Sorry.

39:05.495 --> 39:06.575
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, that's, you know why?

39:06.955 --> 39:17.057
[SPEAKER_20]: Because a certain somebody who was on the internet looking up address directions had their cable hooked up to that one and not mine, so I couldn't hook it up because we don't know how to use the router and we suck.

39:19.978 --> 39:21.238
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I can set up your router.

39:23.539 --> 39:24.939
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, not now, because we're doing a show.

39:27.760 --> 39:30.560
[SPEAKER_21]: You still think, you think DDR on Xbox is still a big hoax?

39:30.580 --> 39:32.140
[SPEAKER_21]: There's an official press release.

39:32.721 --> 39:34.541
[SPEAKER_21]: There's an official press release on it, okay.

39:35.342 --> 39:37.122
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't say it was a hoax, I said it's crap.

39:37.262 --> 39:37.902
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, it's crap.

39:38.142 --> 39:39.283
[SPEAKER_20]: That I concur.

39:41.123 --> 39:42.283
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm probably going to have it.

39:42.823 --> 39:45.684
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we get all this stuff that they put out for Xbox because they send it to us for free.

39:46.024 --> 39:46.564
[SPEAKER_20]: That's cool.

39:47.524 --> 39:49.904
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I'm not buying an Xbox for it.

39:49.924 --> 39:50.985
[SPEAKER_20]: They think that I'm doing that.

39:51.265 --> 39:55.205
[SPEAKER_20]: The only way I'd ever buy an Xbox is if they came out with Mario Kart for the Xbox.

39:55.605 --> 39:58.246
[SPEAKER_20]: But since that'll never ever happen, I don't need an Xbox.

39:59.486 --> 40:02.026
[SPEAKER_21]: However, Mario Kart Double Dash, oh yeah.

40:02.407 --> 40:05.127
[SPEAKER_21]: But they don't have Mario Kart on the PS2 and you have one of those.

40:06.263 --> 40:08.645
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, but that's because I needed Final Fantasy 8.

40:10.747 --> 40:12.168
[SPEAKER_21]: Final Fantasy 8 was PS1, not PS2.

40:12.288 --> 40:14.210
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, that's because I needed Final Fantasy 10.

40:14.550 --> 40:15.070
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, okay.

40:15.250 --> 40:17.352
[SPEAKER_20]: What did I buy PS2 for?

40:18.173 --> 40:20.515
[SPEAKER_20]: I bought Armored Core 2 was my first game, I think.

40:21.396 --> 40:23.257
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted one because it was cool.

40:23.597 --> 40:29.082
[SPEAKER_21]: Because all the cool kids on the block had a PS2.

40:29.622 --> 40:33.546
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I bought a PS1 beforehand when Final Fantasy 7 came out.

40:33.586 --> 40:35.047
[SPEAKER_20]: That was the reason why I bought that one.

40:35.067 --> 40:35.107
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh.

40:36.300 --> 40:37.161
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh So Worth It 2.

40:37.861 --> 40:38.882
[SPEAKER_20]: I haven't heard the buzzer go off.

40:42.825 --> 40:44.426
[SPEAKER_21]: What else is new in Bomani World right now?

40:44.466 --> 40:45.466
[SPEAKER_21]: And there are other stuff going on.

40:45.506 --> 40:48.568
[SPEAKER_21]: There's still 2DX Night Style news that slowly trickles in.

40:48.588 --> 40:52.911
[SPEAKER_21]: It looks like all the songs that are coming back into 2DX are up.

40:52.971 --> 40:55.433
[SPEAKER_21]: I remember you posted something in your live journal about it, right Bradley?

40:56.194 --> 40:56.634
[SPEAKER_21]: Was that you?

40:58.295 --> 40:59.216
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, you want to talk about this?

40:59.276 --> 40:59.396
[SPEAKER_21]: Here.

41:01.451 --> 41:04.752
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I saw a link on DDR Freak and I posted that.

41:04.792 --> 41:29.996
[SPEAKER_18]: Basically, they had a longer list of returning songs, which included some of the new ones are Diving into the Night, Empathy, North also, Lame, Cleone, and there's like one or two others that were new.

41:30.968 --> 41:33.931
[SPEAKER_18]: The biggest update ever is that Tourney Mix 4 has been announced.

41:49.910 --> 41:53.813
[SPEAKER_20]: That's, well, I would get on the internet and check what the date was.

41:53.853 --> 41:58.076
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it was on the June 19th or something like that, if my memory serves me right.

41:59.117 --> 42:00.097
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's coming up.

42:00.778 --> 42:04.660
[SPEAKER_20]: They pretty much outlawed any DDR songs.

42:04.921 --> 42:10.064
[SPEAKER_20]: It's pretty much only pop and music and Guitar Freaks, I think, or Fair Game, if I remember correctly.

42:10.785 --> 42:13.387
[SPEAKER_20]: And then anything else you want to do.

42:13.987 --> 42:16.569
[SPEAKER_20]: I think they were sick of people doing stupid remixes of...

42:17.825 --> 42:18.805
[SPEAKER_20]: Max 300 and shit.

42:19.206 --> 42:19.866
[SPEAKER_20]: Amen.

42:20.106 --> 42:21.967
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, whoever made that decision.

42:23.047 --> 42:25.888
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, because stupid people out there think that they can remix.

42:26.068 --> 42:28.469
[SPEAKER_21]: Wait a minute though, that means you can't enter Legend of Trance, huh?

42:28.509 --> 42:29.469
[SPEAKER_21]: Because that's decent.

42:29.930 --> 42:30.390
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I can't.

42:30.550 --> 42:31.010
[SPEAKER_20]: That sucks.

42:31.110 --> 42:32.451
[SPEAKER_20]: But you know what, I'll just make something else.

42:32.831 --> 42:34.151
[SPEAKER_20]: Or I'll just get something else to come.

42:35.552 --> 42:37.012
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me, you've got another mix.

42:38.053 --> 42:39.633
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, but there's no Beatmania either.

42:39.653 --> 42:42.194
[SPEAKER_20]: Damn.

42:42.214 --> 42:42.754
[SPEAKER_20]: Or remixes.

42:42.774 --> 42:43.855
[SPEAKER_20]: What a bunch of bitches.

42:44.605 --> 42:48.426
[SPEAKER_08]: But wasn't it on, um, it wasn't in the TACO movie, was it?

42:49.106 --> 42:49.406
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn.

42:50.226 --> 42:50.806
[SPEAKER_08]: Make another one.

42:51.267 --> 42:52.307
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll make another one.

42:52.527 --> 42:54.627
[SPEAKER_20]: I've got crap I was working on.

42:55.568 --> 42:59.088
[SPEAKER_20]: I have stuff that I'm working on right now, but it doesn't sound that good, I think.

43:00.689 --> 43:01.069
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

43:02.089 --> 43:05.810
[SPEAKER_20]: See, there was, I can pull it up right now, there was

43:07.597 --> 43:11.160
[SPEAKER_20]: If anyone wants to hear a preview of this one, I guess I can play it.

43:11.180 --> 43:12.521
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, you're going to play us a preview?

43:12.902 --> 43:13.322
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, yeah.

43:13.682 --> 43:14.223
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

43:14.263 --> 43:18.006
[SPEAKER_20]: I might scrap this whole thing because I don't know if I can work with this remix.

43:18.046 --> 43:18.787
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, play the preview.

43:18.807 --> 43:19.307
[SPEAKER_20]: Play the preview.

43:19.448 --> 43:20.408
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, here we go.

43:20.989 --> 43:23.731
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a... I haven't even titled it yet.

43:23.972 --> 43:27.535
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just a remix of The Sound of Goodbye, so here we go.

43:50.647 --> 43:51.310
Thank you for watching!

44:54.912 --> 44:56.554
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's all I have, really, right now.

44:57.334 --> 44:58.075
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what, though?

44:58.355 --> 45:01.819
[SPEAKER_21]: Because you're not going to even be able to use that one either, because that's a 2DX song.

45:02.299 --> 45:02.539
[SPEAKER_20]: I know.

45:04.241 --> 45:05.322
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, what else did I have?

45:05.362 --> 45:06.563
[SPEAKER_20]: I had some other shit in here.

45:07.504 --> 45:10.106
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyways, so that's going on.

45:11.508 --> 45:14.651
[SPEAKER_09]: See, other than that... Remix of Jet World.

45:16.132 --> 45:17.994
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, do a transfer music with a Tar Freak song.

45:19.244 --> 45:42.869
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't because there's not a, the problem is there's a lot of songs, especially the stuff I've been picking now, has either full length version stuff for it, or like, because you need to like be able to like catch the different instruments in there, so because I don't have like an 8 track of it where it has everything separated, you know, so I have to take long, long versions of it so that I can cut different sections out of it and use it.

45:44.249 --> 45:44.970
[SPEAKER_20]: But, I don't know.

45:45.050 --> 45:47.792
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm probably gonna, like I said before, I'm gonna probably cut that one.

45:48.113 --> 45:48.853
[SPEAKER_20]: What's this one?

45:50.915 --> 45:51.515
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, what is this?

45:51.636 --> 45:52.036
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see.

45:53.397 --> 45:55.178
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, this one I don't think sounded that good.

45:55.199 --> 45:56.580
[SPEAKER_20]: I think I scrapped this one.

45:56.600 --> 45:59.402
[SPEAKER_20]: This is like... Yeah, that's awful.

45:59.462 --> 45:59.642
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

46:02.675 --> 46:04.416
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

46:06.177 --> 46:07.438
[SPEAKER_20]: Camelinda Techno.

46:07.678 --> 46:08.759
[SPEAKER_20]: Camelinda Techno?

46:08.799 --> 46:09.399
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to hear that.

46:09.839 --> 46:10.820
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't even think there's anything.

46:10.940 --> 46:12.421
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I didn't even do anything on this.

46:12.541 --> 46:14.142
[SPEAKER_20]: I just, like, it was an idea.

46:14.162 --> 46:15.623
[SPEAKER_20]: I still might do something.

46:15.643 --> 46:16.643
[SPEAKER_20]: You need to finish that one.

46:16.663 --> 46:17.824
[SPEAKER_20]: Camelinda Techno?

46:17.844 --> 46:18.404
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to hear that.

46:19.245 --> 46:21.986
[SPEAKER_20]: There was other news that's sort of Omani-related.

46:22.086 --> 46:22.446
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

46:22.526 --> 46:23.167
[SPEAKER_20]: It came out this week.

46:23.187 --> 46:23.607
[SPEAKER_20]: What's that?

46:25.488 --> 46:26.228
[SPEAKER_20]: Nukutamo.

46:27.549 --> 46:28.230
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, God.

46:28.390 --> 46:29.250
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, play one of those.

46:30.111 --> 46:30.531
[SPEAKER_21]: Here we go.

46:34.822 --> 46:39.385
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking of you, I was a fool to let you walk away Yes, in my life today, make my world the color of blue

47:02.113 --> 47:03.113
Thanks for watching!

47:25.462 --> 47:27.183
[SPEAKER_03]: I am Carven, Scarlet with one, only one

47:59.958 --> 48:01.200
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

48:21.309 --> 48:23.930
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

48:46.609 --> 48:51.913
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so that one was released this week as well as Y31.

48:52.073 --> 48:54.555
[SPEAKER_20]: Unfortunately, I do not have the MP3 for Y31 right now.

48:54.675 --> 48:56.597
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh darn, bummer, what a shame, we can't hear it.

48:56.617 --> 49:06.886
[SPEAKER_20]: But, if you're looking for the link, I don't remember exactly what it was off the top of my head, but I know if you go to our forums, which are on KaliBimani.com,

49:07.466 --> 49:08.287
[SPEAKER_16]: Good plug!

49:08.627 --> 49:22.739
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, you can go there and you'll see a thread that's called, um, Kinda Off Topic But, and that's where I post everything, because, um, our Sack of Mind boards are still down, and, um, so that's where I post all these cool links that I find, and you'll find the link in there.

49:25.341 --> 49:26.602
[SPEAKER_21]: I need to get login info.

49:28.484 --> 49:35.149
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you'll find the links there, and he keeps releasing more, um, I can't remember what else he was working on, but those are two that are definitely good.

49:35.530 --> 49:35.830
[SPEAKER_20]: And, um,

49:36.741 --> 49:37.761
[SPEAKER_20]: Colors is awesome, so.

49:39.642 --> 49:47.923
[SPEAKER_20]: Other than that, you know, V-Rare 5 came out, and people, you know, listened to that, and there's some pretty good stuff on it.

49:48.223 --> 49:50.204
[SPEAKER_21]: V-Rare 5 kind of sucked compared to the other ones.

49:50.224 --> 49:51.284
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it was okay.

49:51.404 --> 49:55.465
[SPEAKER_21]: I was all excited because it was all these trance remixes, but I don't know.

49:55.505 --> 49:57.785
[SPEAKER_21]: Kind Lady just wasn't meant to be trance remixed.

49:58.306 --> 49:59.246
[SPEAKER_21]: I like that one.

49:59.506 --> 49:59.766
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't.

50:00.026 --> 50:00.366
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't.

50:00.806 --> 50:02.026
[SPEAKER_21]: But Midnight Blaze was pretty good.

50:02.246 --> 50:04.507
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still waiting for the Safari trance edition.

50:04.587 --> 50:04.827
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie!

50:04.847 --> 50:04.987
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie!

50:07.395 --> 50:10.338
[SPEAKER_21]: and Feelings Won't Fade was kind of just Look to the Sky again.

50:10.358 --> 50:12.980
[SPEAKER_20]: Feelings Won't Fade, I Swear to God, is another song.

50:13.100 --> 50:16.744
[SPEAKER_20]: I've heard that synth chorus before or whatever.

50:17.605 --> 50:19.807
[SPEAKER_20]: I've heard that melody before and I know it's another song.

50:19.867 --> 50:23.231
[SPEAKER_20]: I know the dumb idiot ripped someone off, but I just have to find the original.

50:24.892 --> 50:26.474
[SPEAKER_20]: Then I Feel was lame.

50:26.714 --> 50:27.675
[SPEAKER_21]: What the hell was that?

50:27.775 --> 50:30.258
[SPEAKER_21]: It was like Tori Amos doing I Feel.

50:35.554 --> 50:42.716
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm healing, I'm healing, I'm healing, I'm healing, I'm healing, I'm healing, I'm healing

51:02.182 --> 51:04.069
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do we crucify ourselves?

51:38.632 --> 51:39.813
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel like any all of a sudden.

51:41.795 --> 51:42.816
[SPEAKER_20]: I played the full song there.

51:43.076 --> 51:55.248
[SPEAKER_04]: Those people out there that are recording are going to make another... I feel... No, it makes me have to go to the bathroom.

51:55.328 --> 51:56.649
[SPEAKER_20]: I have to make a gift.

52:01.717 --> 52:08.400
[SPEAKER_20]: Out of everything that was unlocked in Max 2, I'd have to say the best one had to have been Do It Right, the 80s Electromix.

52:08.660 --> 52:10.621
[SPEAKER_20]: I love 80s music, and that was awesome.

52:11.181 --> 52:13.442
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, Kindly the Interlude was alright too.

52:13.862 --> 52:16.803
[SPEAKER_20]: Look to the Sky Transmix was alright as well, but I don't know.

52:18.404 --> 52:24.046
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just pissed that Do It Right has so many remixes done to it so far, and Dead End has none.

52:24.486 --> 52:26.667
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what's cool about Look to the Sky Transmix?

52:27.388 --> 52:27.888
[SPEAKER_21]: The background.

52:28.048 --> 52:28.388
[SPEAKER_21]: That's it.

52:29.808 --> 52:30.809
[SPEAKER_21]: The background's pretty cool.

52:31.668 --> 52:32.469
[SPEAKER_20]: I like it, okay?

52:33.410 --> 52:36.552
[SPEAKER_20]: Because it's actually, it's a different song if you listen to the full version.

52:37.453 --> 52:39.154
[SPEAKER_20]: You can tell it's a different song.

52:39.654 --> 52:41.436
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, the one I was really pissed off on...

52:43.117 --> 52:43.918
[SPEAKER_20]: I actually like Hyper Eurobeat

53:13.646 --> 53:14.367
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you know what?

53:14.527 --> 53:16.889
[SPEAKER_20]: I would play it for you, but I don't have the MP3 because... I have it.

53:17.129 --> 53:17.369
[SPEAKER_20]: I have it.

53:18.030 --> 53:18.510
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me bring it up.

53:19.071 --> 53:19.351
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

53:20.192 --> 53:20.752
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I'll tell you what.

53:21.292 --> 53:24.615
[SPEAKER_21]: It's kind of long for a break song, but I'll bring it up and we can play a clip from it.

53:24.835 --> 53:25.756
[SPEAKER_20]: I can play the 80s electro.

53:25.856 --> 53:27.737
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you want to do it right there?

53:27.777 --> 53:28.138
[SPEAKER_20]: No, let's do it.

53:28.158 --> 53:28.758
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll do that during break.

53:28.798 --> 53:28.998
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

53:29.018 --> 53:29.499
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll do it during break.

53:29.519 --> 53:29.739
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

53:30.259 --> 53:35.524
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll play all the DDR edits during the next break, but here, I'll play Glacial because Jamie wants to hear it.

53:36.164 --> 53:38.306
[SPEAKER_21]: So, we'll play a little bit of it, okay?

53:38.326 --> 53:38.406
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

53:41.949 --> 53:43.151
[SPEAKER_21]: No, the oven should be off, Bradley.

53:43.171 --> 53:43.511
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

53:47.697 --> 53:48.699
[SPEAKER_21]: Slap Jamie on the wrist.

53:51.202 --> 53:53.045
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, here's a little bit of Glacier, okay?

54:21.416 --> 54:22.610
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

54:47.492 --> 54:48.453
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a little clip of it.

54:48.473 --> 54:49.653
[SPEAKER_21]: What do you think of that, Jamie?

54:50.174 --> 54:51.395
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie doesn't have a mic back there, does she?

54:51.595 --> 54:52.095
[SPEAKER_21]: Go give her a mic.

54:54.136 --> 54:54.557
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it.

54:55.537 --> 54:56.378
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not Politary.

54:56.998 --> 55:01.181
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, actually, when Politary's singing it, though, she's actually in tune.

55:02.182 --> 55:04.163
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the only reason why I actually like Hyper Eurobeat.

55:04.863 --> 55:05.784
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's got fun steps.

55:06.945 --> 55:11.327
[SPEAKER_21]: Easy, but... Alright, um, hey, you wanna watch... It makes me want to burp or something.

55:11.648 --> 55:13.069
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you wanna watch a little bit of that porno now?

55:14.730 --> 55:15.150
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me.

55:15.794 --> 55:16.575
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you want to turn on the porn?

55:16.775 --> 55:17.235
[SPEAKER_21]: Turn on the porn.

55:18.076 --> 55:18.936
[SPEAKER_21]: While I set up for break.

55:19.196 --> 55:19.797
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not moving.

55:21.278 --> 55:22.139
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki, turn on the porn.

55:22.179 --> 55:23.580
[SPEAKER_09]: He's jumping to turn on the porn.

55:25.241 --> 55:26.662
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm setting up for a break here.

55:29.984 --> 55:30.845
[SPEAKER_16]: Play porn.

55:31.966 --> 55:33.547
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, porn.

55:34.147 --> 55:35.188
[SPEAKER_09]: It's porntastic.

55:36.029 --> 55:36.689
[SPEAKER_09]: Chaperific.

55:39.991 --> 55:40.912
[SPEAKER_09]: Rescue input.

55:43.414 --> 55:44.615
[SPEAKER_09]: Nubian nurse orgy.

55:48.263 --> 55:54.427
[SPEAKER_20]: Starring... Too many people, I can't read it!

55:55.007 --> 55:55.568
[SPEAKER_20]: Brazil?

55:55.888 --> 55:57.389
[SPEAKER_21]: I think I saw Cinnabuns in there.

55:57.689 --> 55:58.410
[SPEAKER_20]: Coco Flame.

56:01.252 --> 56:02.973
[SPEAKER_20]: Kitten Coco.

56:06.055 --> 56:07.195
[SPEAKER_21]: Can we skip to the fucking?

56:09.477 --> 56:10.698
[SPEAKER_20]: Hold on, Pebbles!

56:17.502 --> 56:18.282
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, sorry.

56:18.302 --> 56:20.104
[SPEAKER_20]: I was just thinking of a claw.

56:29.191 --> 56:31.333
[SPEAKER_21]: How exactly are these folks Nubian nurses?

56:32.234 --> 56:34.415
[SPEAKER_20]: Because they're black and they're dressed up like nurses.

56:40.560 --> 56:41.401
[SPEAKER_20]: Do-do-do-do-do.

56:43.976 --> 56:46.657
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, there's really no plot to this at all.

56:46.977 --> 56:51.578
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just like, we're in a hospital and stuff happens and I'm horny now.

56:55.599 --> 56:56.799
[SPEAKER_20]: What about all the patients that are dying?

56:56.859 --> 57:00.801
[SPEAKER_21]: That chick that looks like Tyra Banks is having her tits eaten.

57:08.603 --> 57:09.803
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah, she has like a tan line.

57:17.261 --> 57:18.782
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a big mole on her ass, too.

57:22.284 --> 57:26.747
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, yeah, she has an ass, but... Can I skip to another chapter?

57:27.047 --> 57:27.648
[SPEAKER_21]: Go right ahead.

57:27.888 --> 57:30.910
[SPEAKER_21]: We need to get some moaning or something, because this is really horrible radio right here.

57:31.350 --> 57:31.710
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see.

57:32.190 --> 57:33.551
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see if I can skip a chapter here.

57:42.597 --> 57:43.938
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, damn, she looks pregnant!

57:50.242 --> 57:50.642
[SPEAKER_20]: I love it.

57:50.682 --> 57:53.203
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like elevator porn.

57:55.084 --> 57:56.385
[SPEAKER_20]: Dude, she's not pregnant.

57:56.425 --> 57:57.585
[SPEAKER_20]: She's just fucking fat.

57:58.365 --> 57:59.086
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like tubby.

58:02.327 --> 58:02.947
[SPEAKER_18]: She's got back.

58:04.428 --> 58:05.168
[SPEAKER_20]: She doesn't got back.

58:05.188 --> 58:06.028
[SPEAKER_20]: She's got rolls.

58:10.210 --> 58:14.812
[SPEAKER_20]: Dang, that one chick is totally... Dude, I need to find my remote.

58:15.012 --> 58:15.752
[SPEAKER_20]: I feel dirty.

58:15.772 --> 58:16.993
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what we need to find.

58:17.904 --> 58:20.586
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, I think we're going to go to a break now.

58:23.407 --> 58:28.491
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to go to a break, and during this break, you can send us your FUs of the week, because we're going to do those when we get back.

58:28.551 --> 58:29.671
[SPEAKER_21]: So send us your FUs of the week.

58:29.691 --> 58:32.333
[SPEAKER_21]: You can send those over a private message to me in the chat room.

58:32.373 --> 58:33.314
[SPEAKER_21]: My name is Skye.

58:33.534 --> 58:35.195
[SPEAKER_21]: Dude, her nipples are, like, bigger than her hips.

58:35.695 --> 58:38.397
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you're not in the chat room, you can get in there right now.

58:38.437 --> 58:41.078
[SPEAKER_21]: Just go over to www.callybomani.com.

58:42.760 --> 58:45.202
[SPEAKER_21]: and then click on Orange Lounge and then click on Chat.

58:45.403 --> 58:46.343
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just that simple.

58:46.784 --> 58:54.292
[SPEAKER_21]: And we'll see you on the other side of this break, which will feature all three of the brand new, new, new songs in Max 2.

58:54.332 --> 58:57.235
[SPEAKER_21]: We have Do It Right, Kind Lady, and Look to the Sky, all remixed.

58:57.295 --> 58:58.116
[SPEAKER_21]: Enjoy, we'll be back.

01:00:32.884 --> 01:00:35.086
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

01:01:31.147 --> 01:01:34.474
I am the cure, when you wake up late thinking it's a dream

01:02:17.279 --> 01:02:17.839
Thanks for watching!

01:03:37.519 --> 01:03:43.783
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, ask!

01:03:44.344 --> 01:03:46.986
[SPEAKER_18]: This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

01:03:51.858 --> 01:03:52.899
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, we are back.

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:56.182
[SPEAKER_21]: And what are you guys watching now?

01:03:56.642 --> 01:03:58.524
[SPEAKER_21]: You changed the porno and put something else in.

01:03:59.505 --> 01:04:03.708
[SPEAKER_21]: That porno is boring, so we're watching Sailor Moon and the Seven Balls.

01:04:05.109 --> 01:04:05.710
[SPEAKER_21]: Dear Lord.

01:04:06.010 --> 01:04:10.133
[SPEAKER_21]: Can we pause it or turn off the video or something for a minute so we can do the FUs of the week?

01:04:10.594 --> 01:04:14.337
[SPEAKER_21]: So we can kind of get back to the show that we try to do every Sunday night here.

01:04:16.809 --> 01:04:25.672
[SPEAKER_21]: I know you may have forgotten after a week off Oh, big apologies by the way for episode 42 No shit I'm sure Loki enjoyed it

01:04:28.891 --> 01:04:36.153
[SPEAKER_21]: Basically what happened with that is, if you're a regular in the chatroom, you did get to see Jamie and myself, and Brad was there too.

01:04:36.193 --> 01:04:40.414
[SPEAKER_21]: We did episode 42 on Thursday night, so episode 42, it does exist, it was done.

01:04:40.834 --> 01:04:52.978
[SPEAKER_21]: However, I foolishly fucked up the archive file, so Loki tried to do an episode 42 part 2 on Sunday night, except we only had dial-up in the house at the time, and it didn't quite work.

01:04:53.958 --> 01:04:57.739
[SPEAKER_21]: What was the highlight of episode 42 for you, Jamie, the one that we did on Thursday night?

01:04:58.447 --> 01:04:58.948
[SPEAKER_09]: Going home.

01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:03.093
[SPEAKER_21]: And isn't that always the best part of Orange Lounge Radio?

01:05:03.374 --> 01:05:04.175
[SPEAKER_21]: Is turning it off.

01:05:06.398 --> 01:05:07.239
[SPEAKER_21]: Just kidding, Jesus.

01:05:08.341 --> 01:05:08.601
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

01:05:08.621 --> 01:05:10.784
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't even have to go home, we're already here.

01:05:11.966 --> 01:05:15.471
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, that's gonna begin my fuck you week, by the way.

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:40.723
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, the first part of the week goes towards driving all the way out here and using up my gas.

01:05:41.864 --> 01:05:44.625
[SPEAKER_07]: And you live way the hell out of the way.

01:05:46.425 --> 01:05:48.846
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't just turn like this.

01:05:49.086 --> 01:05:50.567
[SPEAKER_08]: I could've been near my house.

01:05:52.361 --> 01:05:59.266
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, I mean, no offense to Zero, but I'm glad that I didn't have an episode on it.

01:05:59.306 --> 01:06:01.347
[SPEAKER_08]: Drive from full speed to South Park.

01:06:02.348 --> 01:06:02.908
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, man.

01:06:03.249 --> 01:06:07.451
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, no, I would have been happy to do it, but I think this isn't what I did.

01:06:07.892 --> 01:06:11.774
[SPEAKER_07]: My other 5K of the Week goes towards... Why'd you put my book down there?

01:06:12.195 --> 01:06:14.756
[SPEAKER_07]: Or I would never be able to find it.

01:06:15.257 --> 01:06:17.238
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, someone put my book on the floor.

01:06:17.258 --> 01:06:18.239
[SPEAKER_07]: 5K's never put my book on the floor.

01:06:18.259 --> 01:06:18.779
[SPEAKER_07]: Wasn't me.

01:06:18.799 --> 01:06:19.760
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't touch your book.

01:06:23.378 --> 01:06:23.919
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't do it.

01:06:26.601 --> 01:06:28.283
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that mean?

01:06:28.303 --> 01:06:31.245
[SPEAKER_20]: Check that book for prints, because I haven't touched it.

01:06:32.606 --> 01:06:39.553
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike Yu goes to A1 Comics Distributor for being sold out of the Battle Royale novel, and I had a gift certificate to get it from him.

01:06:40.694 --> 01:06:43.956
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I had to go and actually pay for the book in a bookstore.

01:06:45.458 --> 01:06:48.100
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it looks like he goes to these old people who were tailgating me.

01:06:49.637 --> 01:06:52.478
[SPEAKER_07]: So I decided to start going five miles an hour.

01:06:54.118 --> 01:06:58.919
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I sped up and decided to take another lane.

01:07:01.019 --> 01:07:03.800
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't really think of anything else because I'm really happy because I'm working now.

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:08.521
[SPEAKER_08]: So I could go through my sleep schedule for not resetting yet.

01:07:08.681 --> 01:07:10.241
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I didn't know this would be a lot.

01:07:12.021 --> 01:07:12.822
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's about it.

01:07:13.602 --> 01:07:14.222
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you doing?

01:07:14.242 --> 01:07:15.022
[SPEAKER_05]: Drugs.

01:07:18.717 --> 01:07:20.657
[SPEAKER_07]: So fucking what?

01:07:20.777 --> 01:07:22.718
[SPEAKER_07]: Cry me a goddamn river.

01:07:23.198 --> 01:07:23.838
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck y'all.

01:07:26.519 --> 01:07:27.379
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, not you.

01:07:27.739 --> 01:07:28.739
[SPEAKER_08]: But fuck everybody else.

01:07:29.459 --> 01:07:31.200
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, let me start.

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:38.521
[SPEAKER_20]: But... Oh, I'm sorry, were you not done?

01:07:38.601 --> 01:07:39.161
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I am.

01:07:39.441 --> 01:07:41.722
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry I wasn't meeting you, I meant everyone else.

01:07:44.375 --> 01:07:48.999
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I have a fucking leak, but I think that she's going to address that, so I won't say anything about it.

01:07:50.921 --> 01:07:56.026
[SPEAKER_20]: I was going to say, if you can't hear us, there's this little knob on the side of your speakers.

01:07:56.046 --> 01:07:57.327
[SPEAKER_20]: It's called volume.

01:07:58.128 --> 01:07:58.829
[SPEAKER_20]: Stay with me now.

01:07:59.249 --> 01:08:00.010
[SPEAKER_20]: Volume.

01:08:00.770 --> 01:08:01.371
[SPEAKER_20]: Turn it up.

01:08:02.492 --> 01:08:03.373
[SPEAKER_20]: Turn it talking louder.

01:08:04.195 --> 01:08:04.495
[SPEAKER_20]: That's it.

01:08:04.755 --> 01:08:09.096
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, now my first review of the week is going to be going to stupid drivers, of course.

01:08:09.957 --> 01:08:18.339
[SPEAKER_20]: But this in particular is stupid drivers that don't know how to use the turn lane or the pull out lane or the suicide lane, whatever you want to call it.

01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:28.142
[SPEAKER_20]: It's that double yellow lane that's inside, you know, many sections of the road, you know, where you can pull in there, stop, and then turn out, you know, or turn out into traffic and that kind of thing.

01:08:28.866 --> 01:08:33.089
[SPEAKER_20]: People think that you're supposed to pace cars when you're in that lane.

01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:36.511
[SPEAKER_20]: No, because you're obviously not going to get out of that lane.

01:08:36.591 --> 01:08:39.233
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not going to be able to get in that lane because you're going the same speed as I am.

01:08:39.253 --> 01:08:42.776
[SPEAKER_20]: You're supposed to pull out, stop, wait for traffic to clear, then go.

01:08:43.496 --> 01:08:44.297
[SPEAKER_20]: It's pretty simple.

01:08:44.697 --> 01:08:50.000
[SPEAKER_20]: But no, these dumb fucks out there, they don't understand that you're supposed to stop.

01:08:51.862 --> 01:08:52.322
[SPEAKER_20]: Stop?

01:08:52.522 --> 01:08:56.445
[SPEAKER_20]: How am I possibly going to get up the speed to make it into traffic?

01:08:57.526 --> 01:08:58.026
[SPEAKER_20]: Panic!

01:08:58.649 --> 01:09:00.390
[SPEAKER_20]: So, they suck.

01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:10.012
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, second FB of the week has to go to, um, Net Zero because they suck ass, and I'm glad I won't have to pay for them pretty soon.

01:09:10.652 --> 01:09:23.256
[SPEAKER_20]: But, um, yeah, they are now advertising that you can get, like, this stupid, uh, software-accelerated, uh, dial-up or something for five bucks a month more when their service sucks so much anyways, and why'd you have to pay an extra five bucks?

01:09:25.137 --> 01:09:26.297
[SPEAKER_20]: I hate them, but, you know what?

01:09:27.011 --> 01:09:28.052
[SPEAKER_20]: I've lived off them for a while.

01:09:28.753 --> 01:09:30.234
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, let's see what else is here.

01:09:30.595 --> 01:09:32.997
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, I have to do unpacking because it sucks.

01:09:33.097 --> 01:09:34.779
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't like packing or unpacking.

01:09:35.039 --> 01:09:36.661
[SPEAKER_20]: The whole moving process sucks.

01:09:36.761 --> 01:09:40.825
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wish I could get some paint and sleep in the other house in the morning.

01:09:40.865 --> 01:09:41.746
[SPEAKER_20]: Everything's unpacked.

01:09:41.786 --> 01:09:43.548
[SPEAKER_20]: But that just doesn't ever happen.

01:09:45.010 --> 01:09:46.912
[SPEAKER_20]: And, um, let's see, what else?

01:09:49.748 --> 01:10:08.319
[SPEAKER_20]: FD to Mashabi Builders of Apartments, because this apartment for some reason has everything cheaply made, like the shower curtain kind of falls off the wall, let's see here, the drawers fall out of the drawers, the gas on the stove sometimes doesn't turn off, which is kind of dangerous.

01:10:08.879 --> 01:10:13.022
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, it's stuff like that, you know, you would just normally not think about.

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:15.043
[SPEAKER_20]: So yeah, FD to that, and...

01:10:17.716 --> 01:10:21.778
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't really have that much more, you know, I was more angsty earlier in the week.

01:10:22.178 --> 01:10:25.820
[SPEAKER_20]: Mostly it's stupid people because stupid people cause all the problems in the world.

01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:29.782
[SPEAKER_20]: Stupid people don't look for where they're driving because they always try to hit me.

01:10:29.862 --> 01:10:31.823
[SPEAKER_20]: And just really dumb people out there.

01:10:33.483 --> 01:10:33.824
[SPEAKER_20]: That's it.

01:10:33.984 --> 01:10:34.624
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, and, um...

01:10:36.156 --> 01:10:42.238
[SPEAKER_20]: FU to Jose, our cable installation guy.

01:10:43.158 --> 01:10:45.279
[SPEAKER_20]: You're a fucking dumbass sitting here at the time.

01:10:45.379 --> 01:10:48.560
[SPEAKER_20]: I wasted a whole fucking day waiting for your ass and you were still two hours late.

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:54.821
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me kiss my ass, you bastard, thinking you're going out of all your way just to fucking set up a cable box.

01:10:55.101 --> 01:10:57.302
[SPEAKER_20]: Which, by looking at it, I could have probably done myself.

01:10:58.102 --> 01:11:01.383
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, and I have to pay you $25 for you to be two hours late.

01:11:01.403 --> 01:11:03.924
[SPEAKER_20]: You should fucking have to pay me instead of this piece of shit up here.

01:11:04.933 --> 01:11:05.494
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, I'm done

01:11:31.656 --> 01:11:41.770
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a few FUs I'd like to give out this week which is interesting because I'm not usually this angsty but I'd like to give a big FU to whoever filed the noise complaint against Loki and I like our third night in the apartment

01:11:44.068 --> 01:11:49.492
[SPEAKER_21]: If you think that was loud, you haven't heard anything yet.

01:11:49.872 --> 01:11:52.214
[SPEAKER_21]: That really sucked, because we weren't even that loud.

01:11:52.234 --> 01:11:57.878
[SPEAKER_21]: We were just playing Max 2, like, kind of loud, and Loki was playing some of his new remixes at a medium volume.

01:11:59.139 --> 01:12:00.540
[SPEAKER_21]: And somebody didn't like that, apparently.

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:02.201
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, poopy on you.

01:12:03.202 --> 01:12:05.964
[SPEAKER_21]: Buy some earmuffs.

01:12:06.504 --> 01:12:11.828
[SPEAKER_21]: My next hot cue of the week goes to the big poles that hold up the covered parking lot.

01:12:12.975 --> 01:12:17.037
[SPEAKER_21]: because one of them took off my side mirror while I was backing out yesterday.

01:12:19.559 --> 01:12:19.879
[SPEAKER_21]: Oops.

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:22.620
[SPEAKER_21]: It jumped out of nowhere.

01:12:24.722 --> 01:12:33.686
[SPEAKER_21]: And F you to car insurance companies because you charge too much and you rip me off and you charge me deductibles and I hate you.

01:12:34.047 --> 01:12:34.427
[SPEAKER_21]: That's it.

01:12:35.809 --> 01:12:37.230
[SPEAKER_21]: I just don't like car insurance, that's it.

01:12:38.751 --> 01:12:40.411
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess that's it, I'm all out of angst now.

01:12:40.631 --> 01:12:42.032
[SPEAKER_21]: Does Bradley have anything you'd like to share?

01:12:42.052 --> 01:12:43.593
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure.

01:12:45.094 --> 01:12:45.874
[SPEAKER_18]: Go for it, Bradley.

01:12:45.974 --> 01:12:51.657
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck you to general lethargy and laziness on my part.

01:12:51.737 --> 01:12:53.618
[SPEAKER_18]: Still haven't found a job yet.

01:12:53.958 --> 01:12:54.738
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm lazy as shit.

01:12:54.798 --> 01:12:59.060
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck you to body parts that hurt sometimes, like back and feet.

01:12:59.241 --> 01:13:02.402
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck you to body parts that hurt sometimes, like back and feet.

01:13:04.932 --> 01:13:10.696
[SPEAKER_18]: So, not that you've been alright this week, backstarter, but probably because I sat around in the chair for too long watching stuff.

01:13:11.797 --> 01:13:26.767
[SPEAKER_18]: And then, uh, fuck you to peer resets on WinMX, when trying to download something from maybe a Japanese person, it times out or peer resets, and you can't ever find that user ever again, and this is where I probably can't find them, usually.

01:13:27.188 --> 01:13:33.252
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck you that, when it was 98, I can't use Japanese, certain Japanese, that's just, I didn't need to upgrade, so, yeah.

01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:36.500
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, not in 1.98.

01:13:36.701 --> 01:13:38.461
[SPEAKER_18]: With WinMX, though.

01:13:38.501 --> 01:13:42.944
[SPEAKER_18]: Because it's Unicode and you can't do that in 1.98.

01:13:43.444 --> 01:13:44.925
[SPEAKER_18]: But I don't even know if it's in 1.98.

01:13:45.025 --> 01:13:45.885
[SPEAKER_18]: That should happen soon.

01:13:47.766 --> 01:13:50.548
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I'll figure it out someday.

01:13:51.288 --> 01:13:53.369
[SPEAKER_18]: And the fucking people don't share.

01:13:53.389 --> 01:13:53.369
1.98.

01:13:53.409 --> 01:13:53.669
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure, sure.

01:14:00.037 --> 01:14:00.977
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm like one of those people.

01:14:01.257 --> 01:14:04.059
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I'm downloading something and I'm like, oh, you're trying to download it too?

01:14:04.179 --> 01:14:06.199
[SPEAKER_20]: Cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel.

01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:07.740
[SPEAKER_20]: I love doing that.

01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:11.842
[SPEAKER_20]: But, um, no, F you to Catherine Zeta-Jones because you fucking suck.

01:14:11.862 --> 01:14:17.464
[SPEAKER_20]: You're a fat pig and you're pregnant and you're smoking and then you're bitching about people taking pictures of you smoking pregnant.

01:14:18.084 --> 01:14:21.985
[SPEAKER_20]: And then you're, like, suing companies because they have nude photos of you standing on your balcony pregnant.

01:14:22.746 --> 01:14:27.127
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, well, first off, don't go out in public pregnant because we don't want to see you naked to begin with.

01:14:27.427 --> 01:14:28.348
[SPEAKER_20]: And number two, you're smoking.

01:14:29.807 --> 01:14:38.110
[SPEAKER_20]: About the file sharing thing, if I don't see people that download for me, I just create a folder with nothing in it for them to download out of.

01:14:38.130 --> 01:14:40.310
[SPEAKER_05]: They can download AIR!

01:14:51.494 --> 01:14:56.900
[SPEAKER_20]: All you need to do is create a giant text file and name it like, you know, Matrix Reloaded dot AVI.

01:15:00.423 --> 01:15:01.585
[SPEAKER_09]: Haha, fooled you.

01:15:03.066 --> 01:15:03.727
You a bitch.

01:15:07.190 --> 01:15:12.534
[SPEAKER_07]: I've decided, though, on Ragnarok Online, though, this is going to be getting such good reviews.

01:15:12.634 --> 01:15:17.638
[SPEAKER_05]: There's people out there going, you know, $10,000 money for cyber theft.

01:15:18.278 --> 01:15:22.862
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to do that, and then after they pay me, my request is going to be, okay, you're fucked, so leave.

01:15:25.662 --> 01:15:27.963
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what I think I want to do with the file sharing thing?

01:15:28.403 --> 01:15:35.707
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to put up files that say Matrix Reloaded, X-Men 2, and all this stuff, and have them be episodes if you can't do that on television.

01:15:36.207 --> 01:15:39.029
[SPEAKER_21]: Because that shows the shit, and everybody should be watching those and not movies.

01:15:40.265 --> 01:15:47.448
[SPEAKER_20]: I was saying earlier that we should have a channel that plays old school Nickelodeon shows, like Salute Your Shorts, Hey Dude.

01:15:47.468 --> 01:15:58.873
[SPEAKER_21]: They have, I think we have it on digital cable too, it's Nick Gas, Nickelodeon Games and Sports, and it shows like Guts, and Wild and Crazy Kids, and all these old school Nickelodeon shows.

01:15:59.633 --> 01:16:01.254
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I think it shows old school Double Dares too.

01:16:01.914 --> 01:16:04.015
[SPEAKER_21]: We have to look on the digital cable line and see if we have it.

01:16:05.215 --> 01:16:06.076
[SPEAKER_21]: That station is cool.

01:16:06.216 --> 01:16:07.696
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's get to the chatroom FUs, shall we?

01:16:08.216 --> 01:16:09.277
[SPEAKER_21]: Because they're getting angsty.

01:16:12.116 --> 01:16:24.443
[SPEAKER_21]: Muheimer would like to say, fuck trying to find a summer job, fuck Microsoft Calendar for not working, and now normally at this time of the year I would say fuck allergies, but the acupuncture therapy I'm doing has relieved all YM pollen allergies.

01:16:24.663 --> 01:16:25.303
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what sucks?

01:16:25.443 --> 01:16:32.347
[SPEAKER_20]: Is I'm allergic to everything, I'm allergic to dust, molds, and pollen, and I'm afraid of needles, so I'm screwed.

01:16:34.008 --> 01:16:36.149
[SPEAKER_21]: And Muheimer says, I suppose that's all then.

01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:38.731
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, but fuck me for being so untanned and white.

01:16:41.863 --> 01:16:43.823
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what, I sympathize with you on that one.

01:16:47.284 --> 01:16:48.705
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, John Fields makes a good point.

01:16:48.745 --> 01:16:51.965
[SPEAKER_21]: If you want to see old episodes of Pete and Pete, you can see those on Noggin.

01:16:52.806 --> 01:16:53.866
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a cool station, too.

01:16:53.926 --> 01:16:55.626
[SPEAKER_21]: Noggin has the old episodes of Square One.

01:16:56.006 --> 01:16:56.686
[SPEAKER_21]: That's awesome.

01:16:57.947 --> 01:17:00.667
[SPEAKER_21]: Square One was the best show ever, like on PBS.

01:17:01.087 --> 01:17:01.868
[SPEAKER_21]: It was MathNet.

01:17:01.888 --> 01:17:02.648
[SPEAKER_21]: You remember MathNet?

01:17:03.708 --> 01:17:06.149
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

01:17:06.689 --> 01:17:07.769
[SPEAKER_21]: They showed that in your classroom, Jamie?

01:17:07.789 --> 01:17:07.889
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

01:17:10.163 --> 01:17:13.085
[SPEAKER_07]: Square One would be piped into the classrooms every day.

01:17:13.105 --> 01:17:14.246
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like a national thing.

01:17:14.546 --> 01:17:21.070
[SPEAKER_07]: You subscribed to the Square One channel, and they would play them during the homeroom of your classroom day.

01:17:21.090 --> 01:17:22.691
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd watch Square One during the homeroom.

01:17:22.711 --> 01:17:24.852
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I could do it in my homeroom, but it would be on.

01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:28.860
[SPEAKER_21]: That's cool.

01:17:29.321 --> 01:17:31.041
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, let's move on with some more FU, shall we?

01:17:31.362 --> 01:17:39.786
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, um... Justin would like to say that this really isn't an FU, but it's funny, okay?

01:17:40.146 --> 01:17:44.008
[SPEAKER_21]: We're getting our roof redone, and I get home and went on my computer with my headphones on.

01:17:44.368 --> 01:17:47.390
[SPEAKER_21]: Later, I walk out into the living room, and there's a hole in the ceiling.

01:17:47.810 --> 01:17:49.671
[SPEAKER_21]: One of the guys fell because the board broke.

01:17:50.492 --> 01:17:54.734
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, FU to him, actually, because I had to clean today, and I had to get rid of the insulation out of the boxes today.

01:17:56.233 --> 01:18:04.135
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, and F you to myself and Loki moving because now I don't live five minutes away from Justin B. Sorry.

01:18:11.249 --> 01:18:19.758
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, John Fields would like to say F you to teachers that give you six essays to do over one weekend when it's the end of the semester and it's time to study for finals.

01:18:20.579 --> 01:18:28.527
[SPEAKER_21]: F you to an old guy in a wheelchair who doesn't wait for a walk sign to appear to start crossing backwards so slowly in his wheelchair that I miss my light.

01:18:28.827 --> 01:18:29.308
[SPEAKER_03]: Billy!

01:18:29.548 --> 01:18:30.108
[SPEAKER_03]: Kill me!

01:18:30.609 --> 01:18:31.430
[SPEAKER_03]: Kill me, Billy!

01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:32.111
[SPEAKER_03]: Billy!

01:18:35.234 --> 01:18:36.375
[SPEAKER_21]: There is a guy that does that.

01:18:36.415 --> 01:18:38.615
[SPEAKER_21]: He has a cane and he doesn't even give a fuck.

01:18:38.635 --> 01:18:40.216
[SPEAKER_21]: He doesn't even wait for the thing to turn.

01:18:40.376 --> 01:18:44.177
[SPEAKER_21]: Because he knows he's not going to make it in time when the thing turns to walk.

01:18:44.538 --> 01:18:45.258
[SPEAKER_21]: So he just goes.

01:18:45.618 --> 01:18:46.958
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, the hell with traffic.

01:18:47.038 --> 01:18:49.399
[SPEAKER_21]: I hate crotchy people like that.

01:18:49.499 --> 01:18:53.921
[SPEAKER_20]: Grandpa's trying to die and he's like, here's what it's like to be old.

01:18:53.941 --> 01:18:57.142
[SPEAKER_20]: And you're like listening to Sail Away and you lock him in a room.

01:18:57.322 --> 01:18:59.123
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like it's soothing, it's gorgeous.

01:19:03.263 --> 01:19:07.906
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkTetsuya would like to say a big fuck you to the little hacker wannabes that joined in on our Tetranet game.

01:19:08.206 --> 01:19:08.727
[SPEAKER_21]: It's sad.

01:19:09.047 --> 01:19:13.790
[SPEAKER_21]: Too bad you guys probably suck too fucking badly at Tetris that you have to use hacks like that in the first place.

01:19:13.850 --> 01:19:14.771
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a goddamn shame.

01:19:15.651 --> 01:19:16.972
[SPEAKER_21]: Tetranet is old school.

01:19:17.032 --> 01:19:18.333
[SPEAKER_21]: I was playing that years ago.

01:19:22.956 --> 01:19:24.618
[SPEAKER_21]: Look, I dropped a piece of the whole row.

01:19:25.458 --> 01:19:27.400
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe they turned it into Prawn Triss or something.

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:27.920
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:29.201
[SPEAKER_21]: They were probably using cheats.

01:19:29.622 --> 01:19:30.963
[SPEAKER_21]: No, triangle pieces.

01:19:31.183 --> 01:19:37.428
[SPEAKER_21]: An old-ass program like Tetranet is probably really easily hackable, so you can just instantly kill other people.

01:19:37.608 --> 01:19:39.690
[SPEAKER_20]: Why would you even hack Tetris?

01:19:39.730 --> 01:19:40.211
[SPEAKER_20]: Come on.

01:19:40.231 --> 01:19:42.092
[SPEAKER_21]: You've got to be fucking bored to be hacking Tetranet.

01:19:42.132 --> 01:19:42.633
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry.

01:19:42.813 --> 01:19:45.215
[SPEAKER_21]: Why don't you, like, hack the government or something useful?

01:19:50.685 --> 01:19:54.267
[SPEAKER_21]: 23rd Magus would like to say a continued FU to Kentucky for obvious reasons.

01:19:54.847 --> 01:19:58.709
[SPEAKER_21]: FU to being super ghetto broke, I can't even buy lunch, cold chicken is what I have to bring.

01:19:59.109 --> 01:20:00.530
[SPEAKER_21]: Glacial Bakwa, anyone?

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:02.131
[SPEAKER_21]: That was a Bomani joke.

01:20:03.812 --> 01:20:05.493
[SPEAKER_21]: FU to hacker wannabes on Tetranet.

01:20:05.553 --> 01:20:07.594
[SPEAKER_21]: Lucky bastards can't even play Tetris.

01:20:07.874 --> 01:20:09.515
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, little bastards can't even play Tetris.

01:20:09.555 --> 01:20:10.255
[SPEAKER_21]: Get a fucking clue.

01:20:17.745 --> 01:20:20.166
[SPEAKER_21]: DDR Angel would like to say that my F.U.

01:20:20.186 --> 01:20:22.366
[SPEAKER_21]: of the week goes to the County Supreme Court.

01:20:23.127 --> 01:20:23.407
[SPEAKER_21]: F.U.

01:20:23.487 --> 01:20:25.107
[SPEAKER_21]: for being called to jury duty.

01:20:27.148 --> 01:20:29.448
[SPEAKER_21]: It's my first one and I don't know what to expect.

01:20:29.488 --> 01:20:34.530
[SPEAKER_21]: Worse yet, I could have been working tomorrow and making more money than a dollar an hour doing jury duty.

01:20:34.930 --> 01:20:36.210
[SPEAKER_21]: Remember, no matter what, they're guilty.

01:20:37.331 --> 01:20:38.211
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, and guess what?

01:20:38.791 --> 01:20:40.772
[SPEAKER_21]: DDR Angel has episode 42.

01:20:42.972 --> 01:20:44.653
[SPEAKER_21]: So maybe it won't be so lost after all.

01:20:44.693 --> 01:20:45.733
[SPEAKER_21]: We might be able to get that later.

01:20:52.361 --> 01:20:55.945

01:21:00.609 --> 01:21:02.651
[SPEAKER_21]: To teach efficiently, follow these simple steps.

01:21:03.212 --> 01:21:04.713

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:16.005
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't see anywhere in the fucking handbook that states you get to throw out students that are done with work and reading books.

01:21:16.946 --> 01:21:17.767

[SPEAKER_21]: Or I didn't know it costed money to be pissed off these days.

01:22:14.184 --> 01:22:14.684
[SPEAKER_20]: It could be worse.

01:22:14.724 --> 01:22:16.626
[SPEAKER_20]: You could have an MPX changer.

01:22:17.047 --> 01:22:18.328
[SPEAKER_20]: That thing's a piece of shit.

01:22:19.469 --> 01:22:22.471

[SPEAKER_21]: Hulk, you need to retire, brother.

01:22:39.039 --> 01:22:39.479
[SPEAKER_21]: P.S.

01:22:39.559 --> 01:22:40.501
[SPEAKER_21]: Give back my Kurti.

01:22:42.845 --> 01:22:43.586
[SPEAKER_21]: Why is he gone?

01:22:46.625 --> 01:22:59.794
[SPEAKER_07]: The first WWE thing that I see after years, or a year, is, first of all, Rowdy Roddy Piper needs to retire too, or needs to get back in the gym.

01:23:00.655 --> 01:23:01.716
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, there's more.

01:23:02.516 --> 01:23:15.665
[SPEAKER_07]: But he brings out the newly sight unseen, iron contracted person, Mr. America, who comes out to Real American and does all the poses and it's Hulk Hogan in another persona.

01:23:16.806 --> 01:23:17.807
[SPEAKER_07]: And he can't be fired.

01:23:20.309 --> 01:23:22.410
[SPEAKER_20]: This is going to be retiring because he's fucking old.

01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:25.512
[SPEAKER_20]: Dude, they're going to tap him and he's going to break his arm.

01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:29.701
[SPEAKER_20]: Am I the only one that doesn't watch wrestling?

01:23:30.502 --> 01:23:31.883
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I saw him retire.

01:23:31.943 --> 01:23:35.325
[SPEAKER_20]: I was flipping through channels and I was thinking, he retired, oh my god, he's gone.

01:23:35.345 --> 01:23:36.506
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm like, finally.

01:23:36.966 --> 01:23:39.127
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, he was cool back in the day, but now he's coming back.

01:23:39.167 --> 01:23:40.809
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like, go away.

01:23:41.369 --> 01:23:42.190
[SPEAKER_20]: Just die.

01:23:42.690 --> 01:23:43.110
[SPEAKER_20]: Die.

01:23:43.210 --> 01:23:49.474
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry, but the coolest wrestler of all time is Andre the Giant, because he was in The Princess Bride, and that makes him cooler than anybody else.

01:23:50.795 --> 01:23:54.578
[SPEAKER_21]: Disagree with me, I dare you.

01:23:56.317 --> 01:23:58.658
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

01:23:59.958 --> 01:24:00.959
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's do a quick break.

01:24:01.059 --> 01:24:01.659
[SPEAKER_21]: No, let's not.

01:24:01.699 --> 01:24:02.839
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's just get into the cage match.

01:24:02.859 --> 01:24:03.800
[SPEAKER_21]: You guys want to do a cage match?

01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:07.301
[SPEAKER_21]: You want to do a break, come back, talk, and then do cage match now?

01:24:07.321 --> 01:24:08.941
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I need to figure out which song I'm picking.

01:24:09.241 --> 01:24:09.922
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so you want to do a break.

01:24:09.942 --> 01:24:10.542
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll do a break then.

01:24:10.562 --> 01:24:11.502
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll do cage match a little later.

01:24:12.602 --> 01:24:14.503
[SPEAKER_21]: I am going to play a little song.

01:24:16.944 --> 01:24:19.445
[SPEAKER_21]: JB sent me a bunch of MP3s tonight of new Sci-Fam things.

01:24:20.405 --> 01:24:23.068
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, what was that one they wanted to play Max Resurrection?

01:24:23.088 --> 01:24:24.049
[SPEAKER_20]: Dude, that song's old.

01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:25.330
[SPEAKER_20]: They could play it on the show.

01:24:25.530 --> 01:24:31.296
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a decent remix of Max, but... Well, since it's been in demand so much, let's just play it.

01:24:31.536 --> 01:24:33.198
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll satisfy folks and play it.

01:24:33.718 --> 01:24:35.741
[SPEAKER_21]: Like Max Unity, that's pretty good.

01:24:36.201 --> 01:24:36.862
[SPEAKER_21]: Do I have it?

01:24:36.942 --> 01:24:38.523
[SPEAKER_21]: They said they sent it to me, but it's not... I have it.

01:24:38.964 --> 01:24:39.404
[SPEAKER_20]: I have it.

01:24:39.484 --> 01:24:39.905
[SPEAKER_20]: You have it?

01:24:39.985 --> 01:24:40.866
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, you play it.

01:24:41.266 --> 01:24:41.887
[SPEAKER_20]: We can play it.

01:24:42.287 --> 01:24:43.769
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, I'll start off with...

01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:48.652
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see, I said I'd play one of these SyFam ones that JB sent me.

01:24:49.333 --> 01:24:53.216
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't want to play one that's super duper long.

01:24:54.537 --> 01:24:55.397
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry about the noise.

01:24:55.777 --> 01:24:57.158
[SPEAKER_20]: It's me switching through folders.

01:24:57.519 --> 01:24:59.220
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's play... No folders.

01:25:00.181 --> 01:25:00.801
[SPEAKER_20]: Nope, nope.

01:25:03.103 --> 01:25:04.003
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, this one's not too bad.

01:25:04.043 --> 01:25:04.504
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll play this...

01:25:05.290 --> 01:25:06.071
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, that one's kind of long.

01:25:06.131 --> 01:25:09.173
[SPEAKER_21]: All these are really long that you sent me because they're all like extended mixes.

01:25:10.974 --> 01:25:12.155
[SPEAKER_21]: I can play stuff during the break.

01:25:13.636 --> 01:25:14.956
[SPEAKER_21]: I promised I'd play one of these.

01:25:14.996 --> 01:25:15.817
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's just do this.

01:25:16.337 --> 01:25:19.519
[SPEAKER_21]: It's another Judy Crystal song that's not in any DDR that I've seen yet.

01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:20.860
[SPEAKER_21]: It's called Boom Boom Boom.

01:25:21.301 --> 01:25:22.041
[SPEAKER_21]: And we'll play that.

01:25:24.243 --> 01:25:24.883
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I'm sorry.

01:25:24.943 --> 01:25:25.844
[SPEAKER_21]: This isn't SyFam.

01:25:25.864 --> 01:25:27.105
[SPEAKER_21]: This is LED Records.

01:25:27.545 --> 01:25:28.145
[SPEAKER_21]: My bad.

01:25:28.626 --> 01:25:28.986
[SPEAKER_21]: Sheesh.

01:25:30.501 --> 01:25:33.363
[SPEAKER_21]: You're the Sypham's whore, and all of a sudden now you're the LED whore.

01:25:33.403 --> 01:25:34.344
[SPEAKER_21]: How am I supposed to know?

01:25:35.004 --> 01:25:36.225
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't keep tabs on people.

01:25:36.545 --> 01:25:38.407
[SPEAKER_21]: Stop whoring yourself out to every record label.

01:25:39.427 --> 01:25:41.609
[SPEAKER_21]: Then maybe I can keep tabs on these things better.

01:25:45.051 --> 01:25:45.592
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, I'm sorry.

01:25:45.652 --> 01:25:47.073
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, Loki, you want to start with Max Redirection?

01:25:47.093 --> 01:25:49.014
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, I'll play Max Redirection, and then we'll play... ... ... ... ...

[SPEAKER_21]: If any of you guys want a popsicle, you can have one.

01:33:47.565 --> 01:33:49.447
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, we have some new guests here in the house.

01:33:49.987 --> 01:33:50.447
[SPEAKER_21]: Say hello.

01:33:50.487 --> 01:33:53.169
[SPEAKER_21]: I know it's warm here because you have to have the windows closed.

01:33:54.010 --> 01:33:55.792
[SPEAKER_19]: It's getting hot in here.

01:33:56.792 --> 01:33:57.413
[SPEAKER_19]: Or in her.

01:33:58.073 --> 01:34:01.096

[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's on.

[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, good.

01:34:09.342 --> 01:34:09.602
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

[SPEAKER_19]: You've got soul.

01:34:15.310 --> 01:34:17.351
[SPEAKER_21]: Have you done anything interesting in Bomani this week?

01:34:18.751 --> 01:34:21.192
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I downloaded the Sampling Master CDs.

01:34:21.252 --> 01:34:24.933
[SPEAKER_19]: If you guys want to get some pictures of that, please let me know.

01:34:25.713 --> 01:34:26.654

[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, cool.

01:34:28.014 --> 01:34:30.355
[SPEAKER_19]: And we could even put some of the stuff up on the Orange Lounge.

01:34:30.375 --> 01:34:32.435
[SPEAKER_19]: There's some good stuff in there.

01:34:32.796 --> 01:34:33.456
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll think about it.

01:34:35.637 --> 01:34:36.877
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to kill you.

01:34:39.178 --> 01:34:40.298
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, Irene, you have a request.

01:34:40.998 --> 01:34:43.039
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want you to play the original telephone operator.

01:34:44.576 --> 01:34:46.297
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think I have it.

01:34:46.357 --> 01:34:47.258
[SPEAKER_21]: I can play the edit.

01:34:47.578 --> 01:34:49.859
[SPEAKER_21]: That's about the best I can do for you right now.

01:34:49.919 --> 01:34:50.179
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you?

01:34:50.219 --> 01:34:52.140
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, yes.

01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:52.580
[SPEAKER_21]: Later, later.

01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:53.120
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll get to it later.

01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:53.900
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:35:04.285 --> 01:35:06.026
[SPEAKER_21]: We have dead air right now because none of you have a mic.

01:35:09.147 --> 01:35:09.647
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm reading.

01:35:11.148 --> 01:35:14.971
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone else has been so busy talking about stuff and the ficus were going on long, so I was like, I'll read.

01:35:17.353 --> 01:35:19.234
[SPEAKER_07]: There's 29 more students to go.

01:35:24.198 --> 01:35:24.818
[SPEAKER_19]: What do we have here?

01:35:24.838 --> 01:35:27.160
[SPEAKER_19]: The novel of Battle Royale.

01:35:28.321 --> 01:35:28.761
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh no.

01:35:29.882 --> 01:35:34.866
[SPEAKER_19]: Jamie's Battle Royale infatuation addiction has gone to a new level.

01:35:35.986 --> 01:35:37.087
[SPEAKER_19]: This is pretty interesting, though.

01:35:37.107 --> 01:35:38.008
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like red and black.

01:35:39.315 --> 01:35:41.276
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a very stylish book.

01:35:41.856 --> 01:35:42.757
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like school colors.

01:35:43.097 --> 01:35:43.777
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, there you go.

01:35:44.657 --> 01:35:46.638
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's just the blood on their black outfits.

01:35:49.339 --> 01:35:50.120
[SPEAKER_19]: So, Bradley, what's up?

01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:51.761
[SPEAKER_19]: You've got the other mic.

01:35:51.781 --> 01:35:53.961
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

01:35:54.742 --> 01:35:55.062
[SPEAKER_19]: How much?

01:35:55.482 --> 01:35:56.643
[SPEAKER_19]: I was listening earlier.

01:35:57.183 --> 01:35:59.024
[SPEAKER_19]: I was listening to Orange Lounge before I came here.

01:35:59.144 --> 01:36:00.144
[SPEAKER_19]: I was over at my apartment.

01:36:00.965 --> 01:36:04.846
[SPEAKER_19]: And as soon as you guys said, fuck yous, time for fuck yous of the week, I turned it off.

01:36:05.567 --> 01:36:05.847
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

01:36:08.510 --> 01:36:09.190
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, fuck you too.

[SPEAKER_21]: Nice.

01:36:19.757 --> 01:36:23.760
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so we're going to be doing the cage match pretty soon here.

01:36:27.462 --> 01:36:28.583
[SPEAKER_21]: What do you want to bake a cake for?

01:36:28.603 --> 01:36:31.925
[SPEAKER_17]: I got one.

01:36:33.214 --> 01:36:34.355
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, boy, this is great.

01:36:35.415 --> 01:36:36.956
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, are we just going to do the cage match then?

01:36:37.496 --> 01:36:38.536
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, we'll go to the cage match.

01:36:39.057 --> 01:36:39.857
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, three songs.

01:36:40.117 --> 01:36:41.538
[SPEAKER_21]: So, your song on the CD, yes, Jamie?

01:36:41.858 --> 01:36:42.038
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

01:36:43.378 --> 01:36:44.479
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, we all have new songs.

01:36:47.300 --> 01:36:55.764
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, we're going to reset, because just of everything that happened with episode 42, and Loki admitting his song a couple weeks ago was crappy, taking it out.

01:36:56.204 --> 01:36:56.344
[SPEAKER_21]: Huh?

01:36:56.364 --> 01:36:56.424
[SPEAKER_21]: Huh?

01:36:59.281 --> 01:37:00.821
[SPEAKER_08]: My song was cool and now I can't use it again.

01:37:00.841 --> 01:37:01.561
[SPEAKER_21]: You can use it again.

01:37:01.862 --> 01:37:02.122
[SPEAKER_21]: Later.

01:37:02.242 --> 01:37:03.702
[SPEAKER_21]: Because that show is technically lost.

01:37:03.742 --> 01:37:04.402
[SPEAKER_08]: Later, maybe.

01:37:04.422 --> 01:37:04.962
[SPEAKER_21]: What song was that?

01:37:05.662 --> 01:37:06.302
[SPEAKER_08]: None of your business.

01:37:07.203 --> 01:37:07.863
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck you, buddy.

01:37:10.143 --> 01:37:11.204
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll play it another week.

01:37:11.864 --> 01:37:15.764
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, so if you were a fan of that song, it'll come back another week.

01:37:15.944 --> 01:37:16.245
[SPEAKER_19]: No worries.

01:37:16.265 --> 01:37:18.105
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a big surprise for those people who weren't paying attention.

01:37:18.125 --> 01:37:18.665
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so what?

01:37:19.005 --> 01:37:19.505
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah.

01:37:19.545 --> 01:37:21.866
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to start with Loki.

01:37:22.346 --> 01:37:26.527
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki, explain your... Oh, well here, I have to do the whole little music and everything.

01:37:26.567 --> 01:37:27.667
[SPEAKER_21]: We have to make this official...

01:37:28.271 --> 01:37:28.931
[SPEAKER_17]: Off The Shield

01:37:55.869 --> 01:38:03.451
[SPEAKER_21]: And the winning song will go into rotation on Orange Lounge, Bomani Music & More, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station when we're not here.

01:38:03.971 --> 01:38:08.412
[SPEAKER_21]: So, each of the hosts picks a song to go in, and we start tonight with Loki.

01:38:08.532 --> 01:38:09.492
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki, tell us about your song.

01:38:10.192 --> 01:38:20.815
[SPEAKER_20]: My song I heard on a trance compilation CD a while back, and then of course since I've bought turntables, I bought the vinyl for it, so I have the actual clean edit for it.

01:38:21.435 --> 01:38:25.840
[SPEAKER_20]: This one is a song you might remember her from the song Sexual.

01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:27.101
[SPEAKER_20]: She sang a while back.

01:38:27.522 --> 01:38:29.203
[SPEAKER_04]: The way I feel is sexual.

01:38:29.223 --> 01:38:30.264
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if you've heard that song.

01:38:30.645 --> 01:38:33.187
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyways, this one's called Yes.

01:38:33.368 --> 01:38:36.150
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the HQ2 Big Room Club edit.

01:38:36.471 --> 01:38:38.473
[SPEAKER_20]: Because the full version is nine minutes long.

01:38:38.493 --> 01:38:40.735
[SPEAKER_20]: This one's pretty long as it is.

01:38:41.276 --> 01:38:43.258
[SPEAKER_17]: So, here we go.

01:40:11.435 --> 01:40:13.656
I pushed up again

01:41:00.894 --> 01:41:02.038
Thank you for watching!

01:44:38.010 --> 01:44:38.810
[SPEAKER_20]: Okie dokie!

01:44:41.351 --> 01:44:46.732
[SPEAKER_21]: Alrighty, that was Amber with Yes, and what was, was that some kind of remix, Loki?

01:44:47.592 --> 01:44:50.233
[SPEAKER_20]: It was the, um, HQ2 Big Room Club mix.

01:44:51.073 --> 01:44:52.574
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, let's see what everyone thought of that.

01:44:52.594 --> 01:44:53.334
[SPEAKER_21]: Bradley?

01:44:54.454 --> 01:44:57.055
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't hear all that much of it, but it sounded okay.

01:44:57.095 --> 01:44:58.095
[SPEAKER_18]: I gave it, like, 7.745.

01:44:59.475 --> 01:45:04.056
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, and, um... What, what happened?

01:45:05.497 --> 01:45:06.037
[SPEAKER_21]: You're leaving?

01:45:08.971 --> 01:45:15.376
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, um, what we're going to do right now is we're going to cut to Jamie's pick real fast.

01:45:19.660 --> 01:45:24.644
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, um, I'm going to cut to Jamie's pick real fast.

01:45:27.026 --> 01:45:32.330
[SPEAKER_21]: And her pick, what we'll do is we'll come back at the end and tell what we thought of all these songs.

01:45:33.291 --> 01:45:37.394
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to do, this is Jamie's pick, it's the Terminator 2 Techno Rave Mix.

01:45:39.591 --> 01:45:40.302
[SPEAKER_21]: and we'll be back.

01:49:15.817 --> 01:49:20.448
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, that was Terminator 2, the Trance remix.

01:49:20.608 --> 01:49:25.379
[SPEAKER_21]: And that was Jamie's pick for tonight's Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

01:49:26.383 --> 01:49:31.484
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, so, we're going to go on to the third song and we'll come around and see what everyone thought of them when we're done.

01:49:31.904 --> 01:49:35.605
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, I always have to pick something crazy, so I certainly did tonight.

01:49:36.185 --> 01:49:41.186
[SPEAKER_21]: This is one of the old school vinyls that came in Loki's pack of 100 vinyls that he ordered.

01:49:43.647 --> 01:49:49.748
[SPEAKER_21]: And this is Raven Simone, who you might remember as the littlest girl on the Cosby show.

01:49:51.841 --> 01:49:55.945
[SPEAKER_21]: She did a song, and this song rules, and it's called That's What Little Girls Are Made Of.

01:49:56.366 --> 01:49:57.607
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're getting old school right here.

01:49:57.687 --> 01:49:59.048
[SPEAKER_21]: This is my cage match pick for tonight.

01:49:59.689 --> 01:50:02.752
[SPEAKER_21]: This is Raven Simone with That's What Little Girls Are Made Of.

01:53:19.653 --> 01:53:20.834
[SPEAKER_21]: I have to take a phone call.

01:53:20.854 --> 01:53:20.974
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

01:53:38.211 --> 01:53:38.791
[SPEAKER_21]: How wonderful.

01:53:40.592 --> 01:53:43.292
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki, go around and give people's thoughts on all three of those songs, would you?

01:53:43.913 --> 01:53:44.533
[SPEAKER_20]: Okie dokie.

01:53:44.553 --> 01:53:46.513
[SPEAKER_20]: Ooh, I got the mic set to long.

01:53:46.713 --> 01:53:49.214
[SPEAKER_20]: Dude, this mic right here, you can broadcast anywhere in the house.

01:53:49.234 --> 01:53:50.895
[SPEAKER_20]: What'd you think of the songs?

01:53:50.915 --> 01:53:53.215
[SPEAKER_20]: First one was mine.

01:53:55.856 --> 01:53:56.316
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, here.

01:53:59.017 --> 01:53:59.897
[SPEAKER_18]: They all seemed pretty good.

01:54:00.617 --> 01:54:02.318
[SPEAKER_18]: I just didn't hear them all that well.

01:54:02.738 --> 01:54:06.739
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember when the Raven-Symoné one came out, they showed it at the end of Kazuko, I think.

01:54:07.839 --> 01:54:10.103
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, he's playing tug-of-war with a cow.

01:54:10.303 --> 01:54:11.645
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, check this out.

01:54:12.045 --> 01:54:15.130
[SPEAKER_18]: Check this out, man.

01:54:15.170 --> 01:54:16.772
[SPEAKER_20]: He's playing tug-of-war with a cow.

01:54:18.054 --> 01:54:19.356
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like the greatest show ever.

01:54:24.815 --> 01:54:29.378
[SPEAKER_20]: If you've got TNN at home right now, turn it to Most Extreme Elimination Challenge.

01:54:29.559 --> 01:54:32.060
[SPEAKER_20]: I tell ya, man, it's the most kick-ass show ever.

01:54:32.401 --> 01:54:34.602
[SPEAKER_20]: They are playing tug-of-war right now with a bunch of different things.

01:54:34.782 --> 01:54:35.223
[SPEAKER_20]: Watch this guy.

01:54:35.243 --> 01:54:36.584
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey, wait, you're not talking about Cage Match.

01:54:36.784 --> 01:54:38.285
[SPEAKER_20]: He's gonna get screwed right now.

01:54:38.385 --> 01:54:39.646
[SPEAKER_20]: Watch this, this is so wrong.

01:54:40.527 --> 01:54:46.571
[SPEAKER_20]: Because the other guy had a... So they don't tell them what they're gonna pull against?

01:54:46.991 --> 01:54:51.595
[SPEAKER_20]: They run down the line of ropes there, and they have to pick a random rope, and each rope's attached to something different.

01:54:53.805 --> 01:54:59.637
[SPEAKER_20]: And this one, the last one, the little girl, the girl gets to tug a war against some idol.

01:55:00.639 --> 01:55:02.503
[SPEAKER_21]: So, what did we think of those three songs?

01:55:03.994 --> 01:55:23.403
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes was cool, um, because I picked it, nah, it was alright, I don't know, it sounded better on the CD, because it probably was shorter on the CD, um, the Terminator 2 one sucked, I, no, at first I thought it was going to be, uh, there's another song called Turn Up the Blaster or something like that, some Scooter song sounds like the Terminator 2 thing, I thought that was what it was going to be at first.

01:55:23.843 --> 01:55:27.024
[SPEAKER_20]: That was a good cigarette out there Sorry, I wasn't in here to hear it, so ask somebody else

01:55:52.637 --> 01:55:56.561
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one was okay, I couldn't really hear it, but it was okay.

01:55:57.081 --> 01:56:02.486
[SPEAKER_07]: The second one, I don't know how, I guess I didn't hear how it sounded anything like Terminator, but whatever.

01:56:03.307 --> 01:56:04.008
[SPEAKER_07]: It was okay, too.

01:56:04.848 --> 01:56:09.393
[SPEAKER_07]: The third one was, like, really silly that you picked it, Rob.

01:56:09.733 --> 01:56:09.953
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

01:56:10.554 --> 01:56:10.934
[SPEAKER_21]: Of course.

01:56:11.835 --> 01:56:12.495
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was okay.

01:56:12.916 --> 01:56:13.737
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll say what I thought.

01:56:13.777 --> 01:56:15.718
[SPEAKER_21]: The Amber song, I've heard better from Amber.

01:56:15.738 --> 01:56:17.080
[SPEAKER_21]: That one was a little too weird.

01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:18.321
[SPEAKER_21]: It was too diva-ish for me.

01:56:20.089 --> 01:56:21.290
[SPEAKER_20]: I've got some more, too.

01:56:21.851 --> 01:56:25.814
[SPEAKER_20]: See, that wasn't the one I wanted to pick this week.

01:56:25.874 --> 01:56:33.520
[SPEAKER_20]: It was actually the one I wanted to pick was... I don't remember the title, but I have another one called The Need to Be Naked.

01:56:34.821 --> 01:56:36.122
[SPEAKER_21]: Ah, I think I've heard that song before.

01:56:39.485 --> 01:56:41.006
[SPEAKER_21]: And the second song was okay.

01:56:41.266 --> 01:56:42.247
[SPEAKER_21]: It was all right.

01:56:45.181 --> 01:57:14.202
[SPEAKER_21]: and then the third song was awesome of course because it was old school so you can send in those votes now to me, I'm Sky, I'm in the chat room and once we have a winner we'll let you know and that song will go into rotation on Orange Lounge Radio we're going to go to break because there's a lot of chaos going around in the studio right now so we need to take a quick break and hope you bear with us and we will be back very soon

01:57:19.372 --> 01:57:32.275
[SPEAKER_11]: Do it all night, do it with me, I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free, babe Do it tonight, do it alright, just take me and shake me till I burn up inside, oh

Thanks for watching!

02:02:37.216 --> 02:02:40.479
[SPEAKER_01]: Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.

02:02:41.179 --> 02:02:42.720
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio.

02:02:44.441 --> 02:02:46.383
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello, we are back.

02:02:47.244 --> 02:02:49.585
[SPEAKER_21]: And sorry about that, we had to give you a lot of music there.

02:02:49.705 --> 02:02:52.467
[SPEAKER_21]: Just a lot of stuff going on in the studio right now.

02:02:52.487 --> 02:02:55.750
[SPEAKER_21]: Some folks are watching the, what, Extreme Challenge thing going on?

02:02:57.729 --> 02:02:59.551
[SPEAKER_20]: Most extreme elimination challenge.

02:02:59.571 --> 02:03:00.772
[SPEAKER_20]: The most extreme.

02:03:01.632 --> 02:03:02.393
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, best show ever.

02:03:03.174 --> 02:03:05.996
[SPEAKER_21]: And unfortunately, Jamie got a phone call and had to leave.

02:03:06.356 --> 02:03:07.437
[SPEAKER_21]: And we don't know much about that.

02:03:08.218 --> 02:03:09.178
[SPEAKER_20]: Last minute FU of the week.

02:03:09.258 --> 02:03:10.720
[SPEAKER_20]: I remember this because this was last night.

02:03:11.060 --> 02:03:13.021
[SPEAKER_20]: Last night I watched The Price is Right.

02:03:13.201 --> 02:03:17.925
[SPEAKER_20]: They had this million dollar special where they were giving out prizes that were just like thousands and thousands of dollars.

02:03:18.886 --> 02:03:21.228
[SPEAKER_20]: One of the prizes that they had...

02:03:22.307 --> 02:03:22.447
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

02:03:22.787 --> 02:03:23.728
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, it's close.

02:03:23.868 --> 02:03:24.408
[SPEAKER_20]: It's Pump It Up.

02:03:25.048 --> 02:03:25.348
[SPEAKER_19]: Whoa!

02:03:25.368 --> 02:03:25.568
[SPEAKER_19]: Holy crap!

02:03:25.588 --> 02:03:30.830
[SPEAKER_20]: They had a Pump It Up machine that they were giving away as a prize, and the lady didn't win it because she's a dumbass.

02:03:30.850 --> 02:03:33.131
[SPEAKER_20]: I was like, fuckers!

02:03:33.911 --> 02:03:36.232
[SPEAKER_19]: I would, yeah, she wouldn't appreciate it.

02:03:37.513 --> 02:03:44.675
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, but seriously, the prizes, okay, the prizes you normally, like a normal showcase would be like $20,000, $30,000 maybe, like every now and then.

02:03:45.136 --> 02:03:47.196
[SPEAKER_20]: This was like, the one showcase was $101,000.

02:03:49.315 --> 02:03:52.641
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow, I would have been on there and fucking ruled.

02:03:52.681 --> 02:04:00.696
[SPEAKER_20]: The guy won a trip to England, he won a new car and a boat, and then there was some other thing that he won that was like...

02:04:01.107 --> 02:04:02.588
[SPEAKER_19]: They should have had a 2DX machine on there.

02:04:02.628 --> 02:04:03.328
[SPEAKER_19]: I would have wanted it.

02:04:03.388 --> 02:04:08.850
[SPEAKER_20]: No, but they had a pump-it-up machine, they had some NHL game, and then they had something else.

02:04:08.990 --> 02:04:09.690
[SPEAKER_20]: I forget what else.

02:04:09.770 --> 02:04:14.552
[SPEAKER_19]: I would have gone on Pressure 8 if I knew, because they don't usually give away video games and stuff.

02:04:14.572 --> 02:04:15.532
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, this is a special.

02:04:15.752 --> 02:04:16.492
[SPEAKER_19]: A tea set!

02:04:16.592 --> 02:04:20.074
[SPEAKER_20]: And you know how normally if they win... A fondue plate dish or something.

02:04:20.134 --> 02:04:21.954
[SPEAKER_20]: Was it that stupid wheel that they spin?

02:04:22.094 --> 02:04:25.376
[SPEAKER_20]: How you land on $10,000 and you normally get $10,000?

02:04:25.416 --> 02:04:25.916
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

02:04:26.376 --> 02:04:28.257
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, because this was the special million dollar show.

02:04:28.277 --> 02:04:28.657
[SPEAKER_19]: It was $10,000 and $100,000?

02:04:29.628 --> 02:04:31.129
[SPEAKER_20]: No, it was 1,000 and a million.

02:04:32.029 --> 02:04:32.449
[SPEAKER_19]: What?

02:04:33.290 --> 02:04:33.730
[SPEAKER_19]: What?

02:04:34.730 --> 02:04:37.891
[SPEAKER_19]: But your odds of getting that are pretty... Unless you cheat.

02:04:39.972 --> 02:04:40.633
[SPEAKER_21]: That's cool.

02:04:40.853 --> 02:04:42.994
[SPEAKER_21]: I remember the time I went to see The Price is Right.

02:04:43.014 --> 02:04:43.834
[SPEAKER_21]: It was so wonderful.

02:04:43.974 --> 02:04:44.414
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to go.

02:04:44.434 --> 02:04:45.835
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to go back so bad.

02:04:45.915 --> 02:04:52.678
[SPEAKER_21]: I know I get... I do get nostalgic when I think about The Price is Right, because it was so wonderful, and I had a great time.

02:04:53.178 --> 02:04:55.079
[SPEAKER_19]: Bob... Bob... Oh, man.

02:04:55.119 --> 02:04:58.380
[SPEAKER_19]: Bob Barker and his fake and bake is a rice princess that we're...

02:04:58.840 --> 02:05:15.807
[SPEAKER_19]: He's got like the fakest tan, he's always like It's not really that he has a fake tan, his makeup is orange, he looks orange in person Yeah, on the TV he doesn't look so orange, but what I've heard is when you go there to the studio, he's like, he's a fucking tangerine, dude You ever wonder what happened to the Oompa Loompas when they grew up?

02:05:17.088 --> 02:05:26.692
[SPEAKER_19]: Bob Barker Seriously No, dude, Bob Barker's my hero, he's like 90 years old or something and he's got Poon Annie running around his studio like nothing and they want him

02:05:28.325 --> 02:05:35.024
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, if you had to put Bob Barker versus Hugh Hefner in a fight, didn't you see Happy Gilmore?

02:05:36.067 --> 02:05:37.687
[SPEAKER_19]: The Price is Wrong, bitch.

02:05:38.728 --> 02:05:39.808
[SPEAKER_19]: Wait, that was Adam Sandler's line.

02:05:40.028 --> 02:05:42.669
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, still, Bob Barker kicks some ass in that fight.

02:05:43.309 --> 02:05:44.529
[SPEAKER_19]: Best fight scene ever in Hollywood.

02:05:44.689 --> 02:05:45.390
[SPEAKER_19]: What do you think, Rob?

02:05:45.490 --> 02:05:57.633
[SPEAKER_21]: I remember that when we went and saw The Price is Right being filmed live, they can do little question and answers sections between, like, when there's commercial breaks usually, Bob Barker's doing, like, this little question and answer thing.

02:05:57.653 --> 02:05:59.974
[SPEAKER_21]: And somebody asked about, like, will there ever be a Happy Gilmore 2?

02:06:00.014 --> 02:06:00.094
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

02:06:02.048 --> 02:06:03.409
[SPEAKER_19]: He's not the one producing the movie.

02:06:03.449 --> 02:06:04.050
[SPEAKER_19]: How would he know?

02:06:04.690 --> 02:06:05.030
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

02:06:05.231 --> 02:06:06.111
[SPEAKER_21]: Or has he been asked?

02:06:06.231 --> 02:06:07.452
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't remember what the exact question was.

02:06:07.472 --> 02:06:08.073
[SPEAKER_19]: That's funny, though.

02:06:08.453 --> 02:06:12.156
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, let's reveal tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

02:06:12.296 --> 02:06:13.477
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's quite a shocker.

02:06:15.699 --> 02:06:21.964
[SPEAKER_21]: By only one vote... By only one vote, the winning song was...

02:06:29.403 --> 02:06:33.827
[SPEAKER_21]: That's right, it was Raven-Symoné with That's What Little Girls Are Made Of was tonight's cage match winner.

02:06:33.847 --> 02:06:35.228
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the track.

02:06:35.989 --> 02:06:36.829
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the joint.

02:06:37.530 --> 02:06:38.211
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the cut.

02:06:38.691 --> 02:06:39.872
[SPEAKER_19]: And all those ghetto slang.

02:06:40.733 --> 02:06:42.254
[SPEAKER_19]: And it won by a whopping one vote.

02:06:43.415 --> 02:06:44.356
[SPEAKER_21]: How many people voted?

02:06:44.576 --> 02:06:45.317
[SPEAKER_21]: Or can you say on there?

02:06:45.337 --> 02:06:45.637
[SPEAKER_19]: A handful.

02:06:45.917 --> 02:06:46.378
[SPEAKER_19]: A handful.

02:06:46.518 --> 02:06:47.358
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

02:06:47.439 --> 02:06:51.302
[SPEAKER_21]: Not as many as usual, but not the least I've ever seen vote in a cage match.

02:06:51.942 --> 02:06:54.505
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think there were a lot of people like, I ain't voting for any of that shit.

02:06:56.506 --> 02:06:57.947
[SPEAKER_21]: For any of it, yeah.

02:06:57.967 --> 02:07:01.770
[SPEAKER_19]: Basically like the real presidential polls nowadays, you know?

02:07:02.030 --> 02:07:05.893
[SPEAKER_21]: I actually had to think about it for a minute because people were voting yes.

02:07:06.093 --> 02:07:07.555
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm like, what do you mean you vote yes?

02:07:08.275 --> 02:07:09.736
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah, we had a song called Yes.

02:07:09.976 --> 02:07:14.620
[SPEAKER_21]: You don't vote yes or no on a... You don't vote yes or no on the cage match, you stupid punks.

02:07:15.200 --> 02:07:16.201
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm still playing at baseball.

02:07:16.221 --> 02:07:16.762
[SPEAKER_17]: We did have a yes.

02:07:17.562 --> 02:07:18.423
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, okay, sorry.

02:07:18.843 --> 02:07:24.525
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so as I mentioned a second ago, you might have missed it because we were talking about Cage Match, Jamie left.

02:07:25.346 --> 02:07:31.548
[SPEAKER_21]: She had another situation she had to take care of, so she's left the building, but we've got plenty of guests still here.

02:07:31.628 --> 02:07:32.509
[SPEAKER_21]: We have Brad and Irene.

02:07:32.949 --> 02:07:37.171
[SPEAKER_21]: The Ice Queen walked in at some point during the Cage Match in the corner.

02:07:38.631 --> 02:07:44.714
[SPEAKER_21]: Anita and Dark Child are on their way, and they keep calling me from different places going, I can't find it.

02:07:44.734 --> 02:07:47.095
[SPEAKER_21]: We're in Mexico, and we can't find your place.

02:07:48.186 --> 02:07:50.848
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, it's hard to drive when you're getting pleasured in the car.

02:07:51.829 --> 02:07:54.311
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, wow.

02:07:55.412 --> 02:08:00.817
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, so, but we thought we'd use this opportunity since we're really low on ideas and material.

02:08:01.758 --> 02:08:05.881
[SPEAKER_21]: Irene had something she wanted to do for a while now.

02:08:07.242 --> 02:08:10.745
[SPEAKER_21]: But you're going to have to explain this because even I don't know how this works.

02:08:10.845 --> 02:08:13.928
[SPEAKER_21]: But, oh wait, we have to have theme music.

02:08:14.328 --> 02:08:14.568
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

02:08:14.889 --> 02:08:16.250
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, we have to have theme music for this.

02:08:16.270 --> 02:08:16.490
[SPEAKER_21]: That's fine.

02:08:18.956 --> 02:08:21.237
[SPEAKER_21]: Give me a minute here because we have to have theme music for this.

02:08:21.977 --> 02:08:23.518
[SPEAKER_21]: It's going to be a segment.

02:08:24.098 --> 02:08:25.539
[SPEAKER_21]: Irene, what is this segment called?

02:08:25.959 --> 02:08:30.021
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I introduced it a couple weeks ago into the chat room, an idea.

02:08:30.141 --> 02:08:31.501
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Orange Crush.

02:08:32.001 --> 02:08:32.502
[SPEAKER_21]: That's right.

02:08:32.562 --> 02:08:34.903
[SPEAKER_21]: It's time for Orange Crush.

02:08:36.243 --> 02:08:37.864
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I hope not.

02:08:38.824 --> 02:08:39.825
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Crush.

02:08:40.385 --> 02:08:41.865
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Crush.

02:08:42.025 --> 02:08:43.006
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Crush.

02:08:43.066 --> 02:08:44.727
[SPEAKER_21]: It's time for Orange Crush.

02:08:44.907 --> 02:08:46.307
[SPEAKER_07]: Go kick your ass.

02:08:46.427 --> 02:08:46.767
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

02:08:47.068 --> 02:08:48.088
[SPEAKER_21]: How does Orange Crush work?

02:08:48.484 --> 02:08:52.365
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, it was kind of a, I don't know, basic idea.

02:08:52.385 --> 02:08:59.907
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't, nothing's finalized, but we could basically take two people from the studio and we're going to ask them questions, the same set of questions.

02:09:00.027 --> 02:09:06.108
[SPEAKER_07]: One person, I guess, can just leave while we ask one person and then they can come back and then the other person can leave and blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:09:06.508 --> 02:09:07.909
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, and it's timed.

02:09:07.949 --> 02:09:09.929
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you have 30 seconds to answer five questions.

02:09:10.329 --> 02:09:10.469
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

02:09:10.509 --> 02:09:12.730
[SPEAKER_07]: Which really shouldn't take too long or anything.

02:09:12.750 --> 02:09:13.670
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's a trivia game.

02:09:14.170 --> 02:09:14.870
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, pretty much.

02:09:15.010 --> 02:09:15.210
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

02:09:15.230 --> 02:09:16.711
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a theme to each one.

02:09:16.811 --> 02:09:17.191
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, okay.

02:09:17.211 --> 02:09:17.291
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

02:09:17.991 --> 02:09:20.752
[SPEAKER_07]: So, someone's knocking on the door and that's really scary.

02:09:21.852 --> 02:09:22.752
[SPEAKER_07]: Did someone drop a spoon?

02:09:23.052 --> 02:09:24.533
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe we have somebody else who wants to compete.

02:09:25.693 --> 02:09:26.453
[SPEAKER_21]: Come in, come in, come in.

02:09:26.713 --> 02:09:27.113
[SPEAKER_21]: Get him in here.

02:09:27.674 --> 02:09:28.074
[SPEAKER_07]: Who is it?

02:09:28.994 --> 02:09:29.414
[SPEAKER_07]: Shite.

02:09:30.734 --> 02:09:31.935
[SPEAKER_07]: He has your shirt on!

02:09:32.595 --> 02:09:33.295
[SPEAKER_21]: Come in, come in, come in.

02:09:33.315 --> 02:09:34.455
[SPEAKER_07]: Brad, he has your shirt on.

02:09:35.455 --> 02:09:36.036
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at his shirt.

02:09:36.056 --> 02:09:37.016
[SPEAKER_07]: Brad has that shirt.

02:09:38.436 --> 02:09:38.976
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that funny?

02:09:39.477 --> 02:09:42.317
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, welcome to Dark Child and Anita who finally found the place.

02:09:43.017 --> 02:09:43.518
[SPEAKER_21]: How you doing?

02:09:43.558 --> 02:09:45.178
[SPEAKER_21]: How big is the clock tower supposed to be?

02:09:45.198 --> 02:09:45.398
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm okay.

02:09:46.838 --> 02:09:48.019
[SPEAKER_15]: Clock Tower Storage.

02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:52.702
[SPEAKER_15]: I need a rope clock tower, so I'm looking for a clock tower.

02:09:52.742 --> 02:09:55.263
[SPEAKER_07]: We're about to do a segment called Orange Crush.

02:09:55.303 --> 02:09:56.944
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, we need two volunteers.

02:10:00.647 --> 02:10:04.029
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah.

02:10:07.111 --> 02:10:10.273
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so who's going to compete in Orange Crush?

02:10:10.293 --> 02:10:13.835
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I need two volunteers from the studio who wants to do Orange Crush.

02:10:14.497 --> 02:10:15.378
[SPEAKER_07]: Just raise your hand.

02:10:15.658 --> 02:10:16.800
[SPEAKER_07]: Bradley will be one.

02:10:18.682 --> 02:10:21.746
[SPEAKER_07]: And, oh, you or Matt, whoever.

02:10:24.609 --> 02:10:27.132
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, it'll be Dark Child, I guess.

02:10:28.502 --> 02:10:28.822
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

02:10:29.083 --> 02:10:31.144
[SPEAKER_21]: So, Dark Child and Bradley.

02:10:31.244 --> 02:10:33.807
[SPEAKER_21]: So, since Dark Child just got here, he can go first.

02:10:33.947 --> 02:10:38.731
[SPEAKER_21]: And, Brad, why don't you take Bradley outside and into the soundproof booth.

02:10:39.011 --> 02:10:39.952
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, we need a timer.

02:10:40.052 --> 02:10:40.752
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't have a timer.

02:10:41.873 --> 02:10:43.034
[SPEAKER_07]: Can someone count to 30?

02:10:43.795 --> 02:10:44.175
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody?

02:10:44.496 --> 02:10:45.256
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody in the audience?

02:10:45.837 --> 02:10:46.617
[SPEAKER_21]: What did I volunteer for?

02:10:46.637 --> 02:10:48.559
[SPEAKER_07]: Does somebody have a watch with a stopwatch?

02:10:49.059 --> 02:10:52.883
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little segment that we... Oh, I can play 30 seconds of a song.

02:10:52.923 --> 02:10:53.123
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

02:10:53.143 --> 02:10:53.603
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll do that.

02:10:53.763 --> 02:10:54.024
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

02:10:54.264 --> 02:10:55.685
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you explain Orange Crush to me?

02:10:55.785 --> 02:10:56.746
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I'm a noob still.

02:10:57.697 --> 02:10:59.357
[SPEAKER_07]: One more time for those who weren't paying attention.

02:10:59.397 --> 02:11:03.298
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically a trivia game where we have 30 seconds.

02:11:03.338 --> 02:11:05.318
[SPEAKER_07]: We ask you five questions, however many you get right.

02:11:05.338 --> 02:11:08.399
[SPEAKER_07]: You're competing against Bradley to answer more questions.

02:11:09.239 --> 02:11:10.659
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, he needs a microphone.

02:11:10.919 --> 02:11:11.600
[SPEAKER_07]: He needs a microphone.

02:11:11.620 --> 02:11:11.860
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

02:11:12.360 --> 02:11:13.300
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's get him wired up here.

02:11:14.900 --> 02:11:16.040
[SPEAKER_15]: You have more than two microphones now?

02:11:16.060 --> 02:11:16.601
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty much, yeah.

02:11:16.821 --> 02:11:18.561
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the end of when Ben signs money.

02:11:19.041 --> 02:11:21.841
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, Loki, I must say, nice collection of DVDs over here.

02:11:23.762 --> 02:11:24.442
[SPEAKER_20]: I have more on tape.

02:11:27.076 --> 02:11:30.879
[SPEAKER_15]: Porno, porno, porno, anime, porn, porn, porn, porn, porn, anime.

02:11:31.579 --> 02:11:34.642
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so you can... Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.

02:11:37.464 --> 02:11:41.827
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, the theme of this one is called Love Me Do.

02:11:43.188 --> 02:11:43.988
[SPEAKER_07]: Here and now?

02:11:44.028 --> 02:11:44.229
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

02:11:44.589 --> 02:11:48.071
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so can we... Oh, he has to cue up the music.

02:11:48.131 --> 02:11:52.695
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so basically what you're expecting is questions about Akira Yamaoka.

02:11:54.116 --> 02:11:54.737
[SPEAKER_15]: I've fucked.

02:11:55.037 --> 02:11:55.537
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.

02:11:55.837 --> 02:11:58.059
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, ready to start the clock and go.

02:11:58.780 --> 02:12:00.661
[SPEAKER_07]: What year was Akira Yamaoka born?

02:12:01.662 --> 02:12:00.661
1968.

02:12:03.564 --> 02:12:06.306
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, what town was he born in?

02:12:10.510 --> 02:12:12.091
[SPEAKER_15]: Nagasaki, Japan.

02:12:12.371 --> 02:12:14.233
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, what is his favorite movie?

02:12:15.354 --> 02:12:16.134
[SPEAKER_15]: Battle Royale.

02:12:17.635 --> 02:12:19.637
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, what instrument does he play?

02:12:21.258 --> 02:12:21.799
[SPEAKER_15]: Keyboard.

02:12:22.515 --> 02:12:23.236
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

02:12:23.256 --> 02:12:23.756
[SPEAKER_07]: Guitar.

02:12:25.057 --> 02:12:26.478
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we have to take your first one.

02:12:27.538 --> 02:12:28.399
[SPEAKER_07]: Which was keyboard, yeah.

02:12:28.619 --> 02:12:32.422
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, okay, and the last question is... Oh, that's it?

02:12:32.842 --> 02:12:34.883
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, whoops, that's four questions.

02:12:34.963 --> 02:12:36.124
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, no I don't.

02:12:36.484 --> 02:12:37.745
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so that's four questions.

02:12:37.865 --> 02:12:39.727
[SPEAKER_07]: You got none of them right.

02:12:40.667 --> 02:12:41.607
[SPEAKER_15]: What a surprise.

02:12:43.128 --> 02:12:43.608
[SPEAKER_15]: Who is that?

02:12:43.688 --> 02:12:46.369
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that like a person on 2DX or something?

02:12:46.909 --> 02:12:47.710
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you kidding me?

02:12:48.090 --> 02:12:49.210
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not.

02:12:49.690 --> 02:12:51.031
[SPEAKER_07]: He does the music in 2DX.

02:12:51.571 --> 02:12:51.991
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't know that.

02:12:52.011 --> 02:12:52.892
[SPEAKER_07]: He does some music in 2DX.

02:12:53.152 --> 02:12:56.253
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Bradley, yeah.

02:12:58.180 --> 02:12:58.981
[SPEAKER_15]: I kicked ass, dude.

02:12:59.001 --> 02:13:01.303
[SPEAKER_07]: Bradley's, like, coming running, like, from around the corner.

02:13:01.343 --> 02:13:02.123
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo-hoo!

02:13:02.504 --> 02:13:03.445
[SPEAKER_07]: You won, Bradley!

02:13:03.645 --> 02:13:04.025
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

02:13:04.405 --> 02:13:07.788
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, just to give you confidence, he didn't get any of them right.

02:13:08.629 --> 02:13:11.271
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, okay.

02:13:12.633 --> 02:13:14.314
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I mean, he got all of them right.

02:13:14.834 --> 02:13:15.175
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn.

02:13:17.497 --> 02:13:17.797
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

02:13:19.018 --> 02:13:19.558
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you ready?

02:13:19.759 --> 02:13:19.939
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

02:13:22.282 --> 02:13:24.263
[SPEAKER_07]: Ok, so start the 30 seconds now.

02:13:24.603 --> 02:13:27.384
[SPEAKER_07]: What year was Akira Yamaoka born?

02:13:27.724 --> 02:13:28.044
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

02:13:28.104 --> 02:13:29.445
[SPEAKER_07]: Ok, what city was he born in?

02:13:29.525 --> 02:13:29.745
[SPEAKER_07]: Okinawa.

02:13:29.825 --> 02:13:32.066
[SPEAKER_07]: Ok, what's his favorite movie?

02:13:32.166 --> 02:13:34.107
[SPEAKER_07]: Pulp Fiction.

02:13:34.667 --> 02:13:35.688
[SPEAKER_07]: What instrument does he play?

02:13:35.728 --> 02:13:35.928
[SPEAKER_07]: Violin.

02:13:52.017 --> 02:13:55.791
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, what 2DX video in 8th style does he appear in?

02:14:05.367 --> 02:14:08.168
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh, okay, you both got none of them right.

02:14:08.528 --> 02:14:10.189
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, there was five questions.

02:14:10.309 --> 02:14:11.509
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, what, okay.

02:14:11.609 --> 02:14:12.589
[SPEAKER_15]: How many questions did he answer?

02:14:12.989 --> 02:14:13.770
[SPEAKER_15]: None, none of them right.

02:14:13.790 --> 02:14:14.990
[SPEAKER_15]: No, how many questions did he get?

02:14:15.070 --> 02:14:15.470
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, five.

02:14:15.890 --> 02:14:16.991
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, he got to the fifth question?

02:14:17.011 --> 02:14:18.031
[SPEAKER_07]: He got to the fifth question, yeah.

02:14:18.051 --> 02:14:19.312
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you suck, you read faster for him.

02:14:19.352 --> 02:14:21.412
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I just, I had to, I can't remember.

02:14:21.532 --> 02:14:22.212
[SPEAKER_07]: But, okay, let me.

02:14:22.232 --> 02:14:22.873
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Hispanic.

02:14:24.631 --> 02:14:28.492
[SPEAKER_21]: I think I know the last two for sure, but I don't know about the other ones.

02:14:28.512 --> 02:14:29.392
[SPEAKER_07]: What year was he born?

02:14:29.953 --> 02:14:33.674
[SPEAKER_21]: I would say he's probably in his 20s, which would mean he was probably born in 73.

02:14:34.774 --> 02:14:35.094
[SPEAKER_21]: What was it?

02:14:35.114 --> 02:14:35.974
[SPEAKER_07]: He was born in 1967.

02:14:38.115 --> 02:14:38.635
[SPEAKER_07]: One year off.

02:14:39.015 --> 02:14:42.096
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, what city was he born in?

02:14:42.576 --> 02:14:44.217
[SPEAKER_21]: I would just go generic and say Tokyo.

02:14:44.277 --> 02:14:44.917
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you're right.

02:14:46.277 --> 02:14:47.418
[SPEAKER_07]: What is his favorite movie?

02:14:48.438 --> 02:14:49.038
[SPEAKER_07]: You know this.

02:14:49.648 --> 02:14:50.449
[SPEAKER_07]: You like the movie.

02:14:50.769 --> 02:14:51.329
[SPEAKER_07]: Lesbians.

02:14:51.969 --> 02:14:52.530
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, Bound.

02:14:52.550 --> 02:14:53.450
[SPEAKER_21]: You told me that.

02:14:53.490 --> 02:14:54.071
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

02:14:54.151 --> 02:14:54.471
[SPEAKER_07]: Bound.

02:14:54.491 --> 02:14:56.192
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon.

02:14:57.352 --> 02:14:58.113
[SPEAKER_07]: It's his favorite.

02:14:59.153 --> 02:15:00.394
[SPEAKER_21]: Bound is an awesome movie.

02:15:00.414 --> 02:15:00.594
[SPEAKER_21]: Huh?

02:15:01.975 --> 02:15:02.195
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure.

02:15:03.876 --> 02:15:07.178
[SPEAKER_07]: He's mimicking Bound.

02:15:07.198 --> 02:15:08.439
[SPEAKER_07]: What instrument does he play?

02:15:08.459 --> 02:15:09.139
[SPEAKER_07]: He plays the drums.

02:15:09.660 --> 02:15:10.160
[SPEAKER_07]: No, he doesn't.

02:15:10.460 --> 02:15:11.741
[SPEAKER_07]: He plays the guitar.

02:15:12.621 --> 02:15:13.822
We confirmed that the guitarist.

02:15:15.843 --> 02:15:17.364
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, but okay, but the last one.

02:15:17.544 --> 02:15:19.166
[SPEAKER_07]: Last one is what video does he appear in?

02:15:19.206 --> 02:15:20.127
[SPEAKER_07]: Dancer, I knew that.

02:15:20.227 --> 02:15:20.407
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

02:15:20.587 --> 02:15:22.489
[SPEAKER_21]: But somebody told me he played the drums in Dancer.

02:15:23.410 --> 02:15:23.911
[SPEAKER_21]: Who lied?

02:15:25.592 --> 02:15:25.693
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh.

02:15:25.893 --> 02:15:27.655
[SPEAKER_07]: You know who it is, the person that told you.

02:15:32.540 --> 02:15:35.401
[SPEAKER_07]: But his main instrument is the guitar.

02:15:35.501 --> 02:15:37.221
[SPEAKER_21]: Wait, but I thought he played the drums.

02:15:38.441 --> 02:15:39.181
[SPEAKER_21]: The skin flute.

02:15:40.002 --> 02:15:40.382
[SPEAKER_21]: Close.

02:15:41.142 --> 02:15:42.142
[SPEAKER_21]: Which guitarist is he?

02:15:42.182 --> 02:15:43.722
[SPEAKER_21]: Is he the one that's doing this thing?

02:15:44.362 --> 02:15:45.543
[SPEAKER_21]: Or is he the one wearing the skirt?

02:15:45.563 --> 02:15:46.563
[SPEAKER_07]: He's the other one.

02:15:46.643 --> 02:15:47.403
[SPEAKER_07]: He's the cool one.

02:15:48.963 --> 02:15:53.724
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we can show you if you want to watch the video.

02:15:53.744 --> 02:15:54.144
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really.

02:15:55.285 --> 02:16:02.126
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, that was an exciting piece of... Oh, okay, so... That was Orange Crush.

02:16:05.403 --> 02:16:09.866
[SPEAKER_21]: We hope you enjoyed Orange Crush, but it's over now.

02:16:10.187 --> 02:16:11.568
[SPEAKER_07]: Go and punch, Rob.

02:16:11.708 --> 02:16:15.591
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I feel your tattoo right now.

02:16:16.091 --> 02:16:16.492
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh-oh.

02:16:18.113 --> 02:16:18.893
[SPEAKER_15]: It's skin tone.

02:16:19.254 --> 02:16:19.694
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, no.

02:16:19.734 --> 02:16:21.415
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what the tattoo is.

02:16:21.435 --> 02:16:22.076
[SPEAKER_21]: Skin tone tattoo?

02:16:22.116 --> 02:16:23.337
[SPEAKER_21]: Does this make Anita hot and bothered?

02:16:25.018 --> 02:16:27.140
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, Rob, you have such a sexy touch.

02:16:28.101 --> 02:16:31.964
[SPEAKER_19]: Am I the only one who notices that he doesn't have a tattoo there, and you're just rubbing his bare chest?

02:16:33.292 --> 02:16:45.402
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know anything else to say Hi everyone So Dark Child and Anita, now that you're here, how was your guys' week?

02:16:47.984 --> 02:16:49.906
[SPEAKER_15]: Prior to coming here or after coming here?

02:16:51.287 --> 02:16:56.291
[SPEAKER_21]: Either, both We had a lot of time to fill, so both I don't know Whenever I came

02:16:58.625 --> 02:16:59.906
[SPEAKER_15]: It was pretty good.

02:17:00.307 --> 02:17:01.207
[SPEAKER_15]: Good week, I guess.

02:17:02.208 --> 02:17:03.630
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm still unemployed, which sucks.

02:17:03.790 --> 02:17:06.152
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I guess it was a good week.

02:17:06.572 --> 02:17:07.893
[SPEAKER_15]: Was at the ranch this weekend.

02:17:10.475 --> 02:17:13.037
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we were at Darkchild's mom's ranch.

02:17:13.358 --> 02:17:14.499
[SPEAKER_06]: We saw horsies.

02:17:14.859 --> 02:17:16.020
[SPEAKER_06]: We saw puppies.

02:17:16.320 --> 02:17:17.461
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't get to ride yet.

02:17:17.561 --> 02:17:18.142
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a tan.

02:17:19.782 --> 02:17:21.803
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, that's from work actually.

02:17:21.923 --> 02:17:23.884
[SPEAKER_06]: I get to go out in the sun at work.

02:17:24.344 --> 02:17:26.065
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have like sandal tans on my feet.

02:17:27.006 --> 02:17:30.107
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's when I work out on the river and playing with fishies.

02:17:30.407 --> 02:17:31.008
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

02:17:33.199 --> 02:17:34.139
[SPEAKER_06]: I play with fishies!

02:17:34.700 --> 02:17:36.020
[SPEAKER_06]: I chop them into pieces!

02:17:38.100 --> 02:17:38.961
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're already dead.

02:17:39.561 --> 02:17:41.021
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I should work at a sushi bar.

02:17:41.281 --> 02:17:42.942
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to bring you guys salmon this year.

02:17:43.082 --> 02:17:44.202
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to try.

02:17:44.242 --> 02:17:45.963
[SPEAKER_06]: If you like salmon, I'll bring salmon.

02:17:46.023 --> 02:17:48.263
[SPEAKER_06]: I like food, so any food is cool.

02:17:49.043 --> 02:17:50.044
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be from the hatchery.

02:17:50.544 --> 02:17:51.264
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fresh salmon.

02:17:51.664 --> 02:17:52.344
[SPEAKER_06]: Very, very, very fresh.

02:17:52.364 --> 02:17:53.985
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like mercury salmon, is it?

02:17:54.826 --> 02:18:00.668
[SPEAKER_06]: It's from the Feather River, so it's got... No, they're just coming up from the ocean, so they don't have a lot of mercury.

02:18:00.688 --> 02:18:02.289
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not like a thermometer, are they?

02:18:02.649 --> 02:18:03.730
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not at all.

02:18:04.210 --> 02:18:04.850
[SPEAKER_07]: They're ocean fish.

02:18:04.950 --> 02:18:05.711
[SPEAKER_15]: They're not from the bay.

02:18:06.351 --> 02:18:06.891
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, right.

02:18:06.931 --> 02:18:11.794
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they spend most of their life out in the ocean, so most of the food that they eat is mercury-free.

02:18:12.494 --> 02:18:13.494
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're predators.

02:18:13.715 --> 02:18:18.317
[SPEAKER_06]: The only predators that live in the San Francisco Bay that eat the...

02:18:19.037 --> 02:18:22.299
[SPEAKER_06]: Little creatures that are in the San Francisco Bay have a lot of work here, you know.

02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:25.161
[SPEAKER_06]: So, anyway, just, uh, that's a science note.

02:18:25.382 --> 02:18:26.342
[SPEAKER_06]: You're from Science Corner.

02:18:26.662 --> 02:18:27.743
[SPEAKER_06]: Anita's little Science Corner.

02:18:27.863 --> 02:18:29.645
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the science segment.

02:18:30.385 --> 02:18:32.006
[SPEAKER_07]: We do the science segment.

02:18:32.026 --> 02:18:32.086
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

02:18:32.126 --> 02:18:32.486
[SPEAKER_07]: Got it.

02:18:32.787 --> 02:18:33.067
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-huh.

02:18:34.568 --> 02:18:39.051
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, other than that, yeah, we had, we saw puppies and we saw horses, because they raise horses and puppies there.

02:18:39.431 --> 02:18:43.454
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, there's miniature Doberman Pinschers.

02:18:43.934 --> 02:18:47.117
[SPEAKER_15]: Minpins, Doberman Pinschers, and Toy Fox Terriers.

02:18:48.942 --> 02:18:49.782
[SPEAKER_06]: They were very cool.

02:18:49.962 --> 02:18:50.682
[SPEAKER_06]: They were so cute.

02:18:50.702 --> 02:18:51.723
[SPEAKER_06]: We saw little tiny babies.

02:18:51.743 --> 02:18:52.843
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like two weeks old.

02:18:53.763 --> 02:18:55.824
[SPEAKER_06]: So, aww, everybody.

02:18:55.844 --> 02:19:00.205
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, whatever.

02:19:00.825 --> 02:19:01.465
[SPEAKER_15]: Animals, whatever.

02:19:01.605 --> 02:19:02.906
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's old news for me.

02:19:03.046 --> 02:19:04.226
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

02:19:04.306 --> 02:19:07.427
[SPEAKER_21]: Anybody have any exciting Bumanu news of our guests that just showed up?

02:19:08.027 --> 02:19:11.648
[SPEAKER_15]: I finally full comboed the Beauty of Silence.

02:19:11.928 --> 02:19:12.428
[SPEAKER_15]: Woo!

02:19:12.828 --> 02:19:13.349
[SPEAKER_15]: You go, boy.

02:19:13.369 --> 02:19:13.549
[SPEAKER_15]: Flight 7.

02:19:13.589 --> 02:19:13.709
[SPEAKER_15]: Woo!

02:19:17.343 --> 02:19:19.706
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no newpamani news.

02:19:20.366 --> 02:19:22.108
[SPEAKER_21]: I've barely played in the past couple weeks.

02:19:23.489 --> 02:19:24.410
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm nuttin' over the game.

02:19:26.051 --> 02:19:27.212
[SPEAKER_15]: All over the keys and everything.

02:19:28.854 --> 02:19:30.235
[SPEAKER_15]: And I play on the left side, Rob.

02:19:30.775 --> 02:19:31.516
[SPEAKER_15]: Just like you.

02:19:31.936 --> 02:19:33.097
[SPEAKER_21]: Yay, left side pride.

02:19:34.358 --> 02:19:35.399
[SPEAKER_21]: Left side represent.

02:19:37.181 --> 02:19:37.661
[SPEAKER_21]: Left side...

02:19:39.838 --> 02:19:42.799
[SPEAKER_21]: See, and we even have, like, gang signs.

02:19:47.501 --> 02:19:55.385
[SPEAKER_06]: As Loki puts his finger and thumb up to his forehead, and everybody's trying different hand signals.

02:19:57.746 --> 02:19:59.867
[SPEAKER_06]: Who else wants a hand signal that I can describe?

02:20:01.427 --> 02:20:06.290
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, this guy is doing a very interesting little hand signal for the crotch.

02:20:09.751 --> 02:20:11.632
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Child is licking his nipple.

02:20:11.672 --> 02:20:13.953
[SPEAKER_21]: Discussions on hand signals makes excellent radio, by the way.

02:20:16.974 --> 02:20:18.094
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you guys already talk about X2?

02:20:18.134 --> 02:20:18.334
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

02:20:20.315 --> 02:20:21.115
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's so good.

02:20:21.255 --> 02:20:21.355
[SPEAKER_06]: X2.

02:20:21.395 --> 02:20:22.876
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, X2 News.

02:20:22.996 --> 02:20:24.316
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so good.

02:20:25.036 --> 02:20:25.516
[SPEAKER_07]: When what?

02:20:25.536 --> 02:20:27.037
[SPEAKER_07]: It's out already.

02:20:27.057 --> 02:20:27.957
[SPEAKER_21]: Of course, we don't spoil.

02:20:27.977 --> 02:20:29.438
[SPEAKER_21]: Spoiler-free review, please.

02:20:29.558 --> 02:20:30.058
[SPEAKER_19]: We never spoil.

02:20:30.078 --> 02:20:30.958
[SPEAKER_06]: It came out on Friday.

02:20:33.539 --> 02:20:34.559
[SPEAKER_06]: X-Men 2, the movie?

02:20:34.579 --> 02:20:35.800
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on, hold on, hold on.

02:20:35.820 --> 02:20:36.380
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on, Irene.

02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:38.941
[SPEAKER_19]: Irene's having a conversation with Matt, who doesn't have a mic.

02:20:41.934 --> 02:20:46.900
[SPEAKER_19]: Dark Child asked something that's not exactly a spoiler, but should I give this information out?

02:20:46.920 --> 02:20:47.501
[SPEAKER_19]: Does everybody agree?

02:20:47.561 --> 02:20:48.142
[SPEAKER_19]: What is the question?

02:20:48.162 --> 02:20:49.604
[SPEAKER_19]: He asked if Gambit is in the movie.

02:20:50.164 --> 02:20:51.887
[SPEAKER_19]: Gambit's scene was cut from the movie.

02:20:52.888 --> 02:20:53.469
[SPEAKER_19]: I agree.

02:20:53.749 --> 02:20:54.350
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh is right.

02:20:55.405 --> 02:20:57.226
[SPEAKER_19]: Shiesty Marvel pieces of shit!

02:20:57.286 --> 02:21:00.828
[SPEAKER_19]: It even says, it even... Sorry, we're being loud.

02:21:01.088 --> 02:21:07.172
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, no, his scene, I was very pissed off, dude, because I was looking everywhere for it, and I didn't see him.

02:21:08.012 --> 02:21:14.936
[SPEAKER_19]: And it says Beast is in there, but I didn't see Beast, but somebody pointed out to me later on that he was in the form of, like, his normal human, because he uses...

02:21:16.607 --> 02:21:17.488
[SPEAKER_19]: No, no, no, no, no.

02:21:17.688 --> 02:21:19.749
[SPEAKER_07]: Beast wasn't in his human form, I don't think.

02:21:19.769 --> 02:21:23.811
[SPEAKER_19]: Not human form, but he has like an image thing that can make him look like a normal human, I think.

02:21:24.132 --> 02:21:24.892
[SPEAKER_07]: He was on the news.

02:21:25.092 --> 02:21:27.154
[SPEAKER_19]: He was on the news as Dr. McCoy or whatever, so.

02:21:27.614 --> 02:21:28.795
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, what to look out for?

02:21:29.175 --> 02:21:29.655
[SPEAKER_19]: Nightcrawler.

02:21:30.015 --> 02:21:30.456
[SPEAKER_19]: Excellent.

02:21:30.716 --> 02:21:32.437
[SPEAKER_19]: Nightcrawler's one of probably the best characters in the movie.

02:21:32.457 --> 02:21:32.537
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

02:21:32.577 --> 02:21:34.118
[SPEAKER_19]: You'll see some great scenes with him.

02:21:34.158 --> 02:21:34.718
[SPEAKER_00]: Kick ass.

02:21:35.078 --> 02:21:38.160
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's more, it seems more adult.

02:21:38.180 --> 02:21:41.362
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a lot more violence, there's some swearing in it, so great stuff.

02:21:41.402 --> 02:21:42.883
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys should really run out and watch it.

02:21:43.444 --> 02:21:45.465
[SPEAKER_19]: And just hope that the power doesn't go out at the theater.

02:21:46.553 --> 02:21:48.214
[SPEAKER_21]: That was the FU of the week I forgot about.

02:21:48.314 --> 02:21:51.375
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I got to go to the movie theaters to go see X2.

02:21:51.455 --> 02:21:53.176
[SPEAKER_21]: We went to go see it over at Truxel.

02:21:53.196 --> 02:21:54.277
[SPEAKER_21]: It's right by Arco Arena.

02:21:54.457 --> 02:21:55.517
[SPEAKER_21]: That's something everybody knows about.

02:21:56.418 --> 02:22:00.299
[SPEAKER_21]: Right by Arco Arena, there's a huge movie theater, and we went to go see X2 over there, and it was great.

02:22:00.540 --> 02:22:13.906
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, we bought the tickets off online, the online site where you can buy tickets, and we went, and we had to stand in this huge-ass line, and we were kind of towards the back waiting to get into the theater, but then one of the friends, a friend that I went to the theater with,

02:22:14.506 --> 02:22:20.556
[SPEAKER_21]: He has a friend that works at the theater So we got to cut to the front of the line We got to go to the VIP side So we were the first ones in the theater

02:22:21.272 --> 02:22:22.853
[SPEAKER_21]: So we got to go in and pick any seat we wanted.

02:22:23.193 --> 02:22:26.354
[SPEAKER_21]: So we sat right in the middle where you can put your feet up.

02:22:26.474 --> 02:22:28.494
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like right where the stadium seating part begins.

02:22:28.514 --> 02:22:29.795
[SPEAKER_21]: You can put your feet up on the bars and stuff.

02:22:30.095 --> 02:22:30.555
[SPEAKER_21]: We're sitting there.

02:22:30.575 --> 02:22:31.215
[SPEAKER_21]: We're getting excited.

02:22:31.235 --> 02:22:32.036
[SPEAKER_21]: The movie's about to start.

02:22:32.536 --> 02:22:35.817
[SPEAKER_21]: Five minutes before the movie starts, all the lights go out and the emergency lights come on.

02:22:36.157 --> 02:22:36.637
[SPEAKER_21]: We're sorry.

02:22:36.657 --> 02:22:37.397
[SPEAKER_21]: The power's out.

02:22:38.338 --> 02:22:39.478
[SPEAKER_21]: And how long was it out for?

02:22:40.658 --> 02:22:45.840
[SPEAKER_21]: Long enough so that they escorted us out of the theater and gave us tickets to see another movie at another time.

02:22:46.760 --> 02:22:48.181
[SPEAKER_19]: So what a waste of two hours.

02:22:48.741 --> 02:22:49.781
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you go back in and watch it?

02:22:50.322 --> 02:22:51.022
[SPEAKER_19]: No, we couldn't.

02:22:51.202 --> 02:22:51.862
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, okay.

02:22:52.102 --> 02:22:54.323
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, I thought when you... They closed theaters for the night.

02:22:54.583 --> 02:22:57.624
[SPEAKER_19]: You had called me earlier or later, and I thought you said that they started to move it up.

02:22:57.785 --> 02:22:58.105
[SPEAKER_21]: No, no.

02:22:58.345 --> 02:23:03.067
[SPEAKER_21]: The manager came in and was shooing us all out, so that really sucked.

02:23:03.487 --> 02:23:12.030
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I have some friends that went to go see it that same day, but they were in the theater a little earlier, so they were halfway through the movie when the car went out.

02:23:12.050 --> 02:23:12.090
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh.

02:23:14.151 --> 02:23:16.033
[SPEAKER_21]: I was saying it's gotta really suck to be those guys.

02:23:16.053 --> 02:23:17.333
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why I was telling my friend that I went with.

02:23:18.114 --> 02:23:21.236
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, it sucks for us, but it really sucks for them.

02:23:21.316 --> 02:23:22.977
[SPEAKER_21]: Like when I went and saw Princess Mononoke.

02:23:24.298 --> 02:23:25.119
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

02:23:25.619 --> 02:23:28.341
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob, you reminded me of one of my fuck you's I need to say for the week.

02:23:29.301 --> 02:23:30.542
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck you to Bombay.

02:23:31.543 --> 02:23:35.926
[SPEAKER_15]: See, Bombay, he didn't get to go to see the premiere of it on Thursday.

02:23:36.431 --> 02:23:37.352
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got tickets for 545 opening day.

02:23:59.952 --> 02:24:00.613
[SPEAKER_19]: 5.45 opening day.

02:24:01.113 --> 02:24:02.474
[SPEAKER_19]: I better get some tickets too so we can go.

02:24:03.215 --> 02:24:06.076
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, Loki, I'm going to have premiere passes.

02:24:07.137 --> 02:24:07.677
[SPEAKER_19]: So what?

02:24:07.737 --> 02:24:08.298
[SPEAKER_19]: Do I care?

02:24:08.318 --> 02:24:09.979
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you sure you can get in with premiere passes?

02:24:11.140 --> 02:24:14.342
[SPEAKER_19]: Usually they don't let you use any kind of passes on brand new movies until two weeks.

02:24:15.402 --> 02:24:16.643
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, okay, radio station premiere.

02:24:19.565 --> 02:24:21.386
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yeah, I guess premiere.

02:24:21.426 --> 02:24:22.987
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to see that movie so badly.

02:24:23.288 --> 02:24:24.128
[SPEAKER_19]: I know, everybody.

02:24:24.168 --> 02:24:25.309
[SPEAKER_20]: Counting down seconds.

02:24:26.380 --> 02:24:28.341
[SPEAKER_19]: That movie's gonna fuckin' make me piss my pants.

02:24:29.222 --> 02:24:30.463
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm gonna have to bring a new pair of shorts.

02:24:31.023 --> 02:24:32.524
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm gonna see that movie, like, eight times.

02:24:33.925 --> 02:24:37.628
[SPEAKER_19]: You're one of those weird people who's gonna dress up in, like, the black trench coat and the glasses.

02:24:37.848 --> 02:24:39.209
[SPEAKER_19]: I already own that, shut up.

02:24:42.091 --> 02:24:44.413
[SPEAKER_15]: I normally wear a trench coat, so... Shut up.

02:24:44.433 --> 02:24:45.954
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not a trench coat!

02:24:46.634 --> 02:24:47.795
[SPEAKER_15]: Trench coats go down to your ankle.

02:24:49.636 --> 02:24:52.700
[SPEAKER_19]: At least I don't have the glasses that don't have like the side arm thing.

02:24:52.720 --> 02:24:55.103
[SPEAKER_19]: They just stick onto your nose like Morpheus had.

02:24:55.743 --> 02:24:56.925
[SPEAKER_15]: Morpheus glasses are pimps.

02:24:56.965 --> 02:24:58.807
[SPEAKER_15]: Too bad they're $300 so I can't afford them.

02:24:59.468 --> 02:25:01.671
[SPEAKER_19]: Go get some knockoffs in Mexico or something, I'm sure.

02:25:03.035 --> 02:25:05.236
[SPEAKER_20]: Yo, look at me as the lens pops out.

02:25:07.617 --> 02:25:08.458
[SPEAKER_20]: Yo, yo.

02:25:10.399 --> 02:25:13.660
[SPEAKER_19]: Would you like to go deeper down the rabbit hole or whatever the fuck you said?

02:25:14.061 --> 02:25:14.501
[SPEAKER_21]: Cornhole?

02:25:14.641 --> 02:25:27.327
[SPEAKER_21]: I was reading some review on ain'titcoolnews.com where this guy just kept overusing the words fuck and cum and pissed myself like in his review of Matrix Reloaded because I guess it's been screened already at Cannes Film Festival and stuff.

02:25:27.428 --> 02:25:28.968
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that's funny.

02:25:30.189 --> 02:25:31.069
[SPEAKER_19]: How mature.

02:25:31.089 --> 02:25:31.970
[SPEAKER_19]: I know.

02:25:34.045 --> 02:25:35.246
[SPEAKER_19]: It was probably one of the... Tee hee.

02:25:35.506 --> 02:25:36.367
[SPEAKER_19]: I said fuck.

02:25:37.008 --> 02:25:39.370
[SPEAKER_19]: It was probably, uh... What's his name?

02:25:39.390 --> 02:25:43.614
[SPEAKER_19]: The one of the... Ah, one of those... One of the guys died.

02:25:43.954 --> 02:25:44.695
[SPEAKER_19]: The two movie critics.

02:25:45.836 --> 02:25:46.537
[SPEAKER_19]: Siskel and Ebert.

02:25:46.677 --> 02:25:47.398
[SPEAKER_19]: Which one's still alive?

02:25:47.418 --> 02:25:48.799
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, Ebert and Roper.

02:25:48.819 --> 02:25:49.660
[SPEAKER_19]: No, now it's Ebert and Roper.

02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:50.821
[SPEAKER_19]: It was probably Ebert who did it.

02:25:50.861 --> 02:25:52.342
[SPEAKER_19]: He's all... Shit, fuck, come...

02:25:54.244 --> 02:25:55.887
[SPEAKER_21]: There's one thing I don't want to think about.

02:25:56.527 --> 02:25:57.248
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:25:57.289 --> 02:25:59.712
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm at a river, at a pretty lake, pretty lake.

02:26:06.504 --> 02:26:10.987
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was too lazy to write up another review, so he just copied the one from the porn movie and used it for the Matrix.

02:26:11.047 --> 02:26:15.111
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, he posted a porn movie review and he thought, you know, because he didn't want to make up a Matrix review.

02:26:15.131 --> 02:26:16.572
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's why it said that.

02:26:16.852 --> 02:26:17.913
[SPEAKER_15]: It was probably a scat film.

02:26:18.193 --> 02:26:27.581
[SPEAKER_19]: And they just changed the names of the characters to, like, Neo and... When Neo took Morpheus from behind, it was the most excellent scene I ever saw in my life.

02:26:28.021 --> 02:26:29.222
[SPEAKER_19]: The anal Matrix.

02:26:31.284 --> 02:26:33.105
[SPEAKER_19]: Would you like to go deeper down the hole?

02:26:35.407 --> 02:26:36.768
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see how far this hole takes you.

02:26:37.589 --> 02:26:37.929
[SPEAKER_19]: Whoa!

02:26:40.511 --> 02:26:41.151
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Kung Fu.

02:26:42.312 --> 02:26:43.553
[SPEAKER_19]: Eleventy billion dollars.

02:26:44.334 --> 02:26:44.614
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

02:26:46.735 --> 02:26:47.196
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway.

02:26:48.997 --> 02:26:50.598
[SPEAKER_19]: So go see Mex- Ex- Mex- Whoa.

02:26:50.998 --> 02:26:51.879
[SPEAKER_14]: I know GHB.

02:26:55.931 --> 02:26:56.811
[SPEAKER_20]: X-Men 2 X-Men 2

02:27:25.222 --> 02:27:26.222
[SPEAKER_19]: No, this is the Clerks Animated.

02:27:26.242 --> 02:27:28.062
[SPEAKER_19]: No, Clerks Animated, another thing everybody should watch.

02:27:29.023 --> 02:27:33.483
[SPEAKER_19]: Regardless if you're fans of Kevin Smith or the Clerks or not, it's one of the greatest cartoons ever.

02:27:33.883 --> 02:27:37.164
[SPEAKER_19]: Proof that the greatest shows get kicked off TV all the time.

02:27:38.044 --> 02:27:38.984
[SPEAKER_19]: Like Family Guy.

02:27:39.004 --> 02:27:42.425
[SPEAKER_19]: Family Guy at least got more play than... Invader Zim.

02:27:42.445 --> 02:27:44.325
[SPEAKER_19]: Invader Zim got like a couple seasons too though, didn't it?

02:27:44.445 --> 02:27:52.307
[SPEAKER_20]: It got two seasons before John Vasquez pulled it off because Nickelodeon is trying to make it more kid-friendly.

02:27:52.587 --> 02:27:54.407
[SPEAKER_15]: Comedy Central is supposed to be picking up Clerks.

02:27:55.257 --> 02:28:03.524
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sure they'll show the first six, but maybe, hopefully.

02:28:04.144 --> 02:28:06.586
[SPEAKER_15]: But Kevin Smith said there's no more Jay and Silent Bob in anything.

02:28:08.067 --> 02:28:11.210
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, that's a lie already, because they are doing a Clerks animated movie.

02:28:12.130 --> 02:28:14.732
[SPEAKER_19]: And so I'm sure Jay and Silent Bob have to be in that.

02:28:14.752 --> 02:28:19.136
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, the only reason they're doing no Jay and Silent Bob is because Jay's missing in action.

02:28:19.176 --> 02:28:19.716
[SPEAKER_20]: Jay, yeah.

02:28:20.437 --> 02:28:20.577
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

02:28:22.273 --> 02:28:22.773
[SPEAKER_20]: What happened?

02:28:23.233 --> 02:28:24.034
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

02:28:24.154 --> 02:28:24.674
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think they know.

02:28:24.694 --> 02:28:27.075
[SPEAKER_19]: Did he turn tail and run out of the country, is what I heard?

02:28:27.415 --> 02:28:28.515
[SPEAKER_19]: Out of the country, he's dead.

02:28:29.296 --> 02:28:30.016
[SPEAKER_19]: He's not dead.

02:28:30.096 --> 02:28:34.778
[SPEAKER_19]: He's hiding on some island somewhere because of his convictions or whatever.

02:28:35.778 --> 02:28:37.059
[SPEAKER_19]: Conviction, that's not the right word, is it?

02:28:37.079 --> 02:28:37.519
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

02:28:38.259 --> 02:28:42.061
[SPEAKER_15]: Didn't he talk about Jason Mewes being banished on an evening with Kevin Smith?

02:28:42.701 --> 02:28:43.001
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

02:28:43.041 --> 02:28:47.883
[SPEAKER_15]: At Ghost Ward, he brought that up, and then Jason Mewes walks up on stage, and he knows where Jason is.

02:28:50.417 --> 02:28:54.518
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like one of the biggest conspiracies since like the whole Biggie, Notorious B.I.G.

02:28:54.558 --> 02:28:55.498
[SPEAKER_19]: and Tupac thing, you know?

02:28:55.958 --> 02:28:56.878
[SPEAKER_19]: Is he really dead?

02:28:58.779 --> 02:29:00.779
[SPEAKER_15]: I just think Jay ran off with Boo Boo Kitty Fuck.

02:29:03.019 --> 02:29:04.600
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, I don't know who Boo Boo Kitty Fuck is.

02:29:07.300 --> 02:29:09.360
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, I think he ran off with Strong Bad.

02:29:11.601 --> 02:29:18.202
[SPEAKER_19]: So, on another note... Rob's over here eating fucking pretzels.

02:29:18.242 --> 02:29:18.782
[SPEAKER_19]: Do your job.

02:29:19.665 --> 02:29:20.145
[SPEAKER_19]: What job?

02:29:21.886 --> 02:29:23.387
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, we're going to go to a break real fast.

02:29:24.387 --> 02:29:25.268
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we're going to come back.

02:29:28.590 --> 02:29:32.011
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I've been making my living with the kind of job we call blow.

02:29:36.293 --> 02:29:36.954
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, yes.

02:29:39.315 --> 02:29:39.995
[SPEAKER_21]: We go to break now.

02:29:40.596 --> 02:29:44.858
[SPEAKER_21]: And after break, we're going to come back with Ask Orange Lounge.

02:29:45.999 --> 02:29:49.500
[SPEAKER_21]: Where you can ask any of the members of Orange Lounge a question that you want.

02:29:50.460 --> 02:29:51.860
[SPEAKER_21]: Except Jamie, because she's not here right now.

02:29:52.180 --> 02:29:53.561
[SPEAKER_21]: But you can ask me, you can ask Loki.

02:29:53.901 --> 02:29:56.501
[SPEAKER_21]: You can ask RicePrincess or LankyStyle.

02:29:56.821 --> 02:29:58.562
[SPEAKER_21]: You can ask DarkChild or DDRholic.

02:29:58.602 --> 02:29:59.602
[SPEAKER_21]: You can ask Arcadian42.

02:30:00.082 --> 02:30:03.043
[SPEAKER_21]: Or you can ask the Ice Princess.

02:30:04.323 --> 02:30:05.163
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, sorry, the Ice Queen.

02:30:05.543 --> 02:30:06.843
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry, are you a princess or a queen?

02:30:07.823 --> 02:30:08.304
[SPEAKER_21]: He's a queen.

02:30:08.344 --> 02:30:14.125
[SPEAKER_21]: He's more of a queen than a... Well, then you're definitely a queen.

02:30:16.331 --> 02:30:18.373
[SPEAKER_21]: Vanessa May with Destiny

02:30:45.808 --> 02:30:46.370
This is my destiny.

02:31:17.690 --> 02:31:18.691
Thanks for watching!

02:32:45.827 --> 02:32:46.833
Thanks for watching!

02:33:19.591 --> 02:33:20.692
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

02:36:13.039 --> 02:36:13.906
Thank you for watching

02:36:56.775 --> 02:37:05.339
[SPEAKER_12]: Hiho, Kermit the Fog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

02:37:05.459 --> 02:37:11.461
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

02:37:14.283 --> 02:37:20.145
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello, we're back, and you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 43, and, um...

02:37:24.306 --> 02:37:25.427
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi Irene, how are you doing?

02:37:25.567 --> 02:37:26.187
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, I'm pretty good.

02:37:26.227 --> 02:37:26.708
[SPEAKER_07]: How about you?

02:37:26.828 --> 02:37:27.448
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty good.

02:37:27.468 --> 02:37:28.369
[SPEAKER_07]: I love your shirt.

02:37:28.649 --> 02:37:29.209
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

02:37:29.670 --> 02:37:30.790
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you tell everyone about Rocky?

02:37:31.671 --> 02:37:32.351
[SPEAKER_21]: What about Rocky?

02:37:32.812 --> 02:37:36.094
[SPEAKER_07]: About Rocky, how it's going to be on May 10th at Davis.

02:37:36.114 --> 02:37:44.780
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you have to remember we're an international show, but if anybody's local to Sacramento... It's going to be at the Campus Cinema at UC Davis, Chem Lab 194.

02:37:45.420 --> 02:37:47.421
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it used to be, but now it's an actual theater.

02:37:48.542 --> 02:37:51.244
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're doing Rocky at midnight on Saturday, May 10th.

02:37:52.200 --> 02:37:53.141
[SPEAKER_15]: At the theater in Davis?

02:37:53.622 --> 02:37:59.267
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually, no, it's on the campus, but they changed the Chem Lab 194 to an actual theater.

02:37:59.527 --> 02:38:00.448
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

02:38:00.488 --> 02:38:01.529
[SPEAKER_07]: What building is that?

02:38:01.749 --> 02:38:02.149
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you know?

02:38:03.290 --> 02:38:03.690
[SPEAKER_07]: You would know.

02:38:07.094 --> 02:38:09.436
[SPEAKER_18]: 194, it's the big chem building.

02:38:10.697 --> 02:38:11.537
[SPEAKER_18]: Right by the chem building.

02:38:11.558 --> 02:38:12.739
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like really big.

02:38:12.799 --> 02:38:14.240
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like across from the silo.

02:38:18.862 --> 02:38:20.202
[SPEAKER_07]: It's where the soccer field is.

02:38:20.222 --> 02:38:22.123
[SPEAKER_07]: There were soccer people playing.

02:38:23.944 --> 02:38:25.925
[SPEAKER_07]: Student Union and the Taco Bell.

02:38:26.905 --> 02:38:27.866
[SPEAKER_18]: I never went to this.

02:38:29.247 --> 02:38:30.367
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he would know or not.

02:38:31.088 --> 02:38:32.588
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you know where the Student Union is.

02:38:32.708 --> 02:38:36.330
[SPEAKER_18]: You go basically... I can't remember the directions.

02:38:36.350 --> 02:38:38.751
[SPEAKER_07]: We can give directions later, but if you're interested, email someone.

02:38:38.771 --> 02:38:40.752
[SPEAKER_18]: If you go to vtour.ucdavis.edu, you can look on the map there.

02:38:40.772 --> 02:38:40.972
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

02:38:46.471 --> 02:38:49.253
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so as I said, it's time for Ask Orange Lounge.

02:38:54.796 --> 02:38:55.676
[SPEAKER_07]: Ask Orange Lounge.

02:38:55.696 --> 02:38:56.016
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

02:38:56.036 --> 02:38:56.837
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to sing this.

02:38:56.977 --> 02:38:57.297
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

02:38:57.597 --> 02:38:59.438
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, you need to make new theme songs.

02:38:59.478 --> 02:38:59.858
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.

02:38:59.978 --> 02:39:00.839
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, here we go.

02:39:00.859 --> 02:39:09.904
[SPEAKER_21]: First question is from Justin B., and he wants to know, will you play some of those cool songs I sent you, like Speed Over Beethoven, Living in America, Hungarian Dance No.

02:39:09.924 --> 02:39:11.064
[SPEAKER_21]: 5, Mary Blonde, I Love You?

02:39:11.084 --> 02:39:11.285
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

02:39:12.930 --> 02:39:14.751
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, this is the problem.

02:39:15.131 --> 02:39:21.114
[SPEAKER_21]: While I want to honor that request and let everybody hear, because it's some rare stuff, it's some cool stuff.

02:39:21.154 --> 02:39:23.095
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not from SyFam, it's from LED Records.

02:39:23.135 --> 02:39:23.975
[SPEAKER_21]: I fucked that up earlier.

02:39:24.435 --> 02:39:30.778
[SPEAKER_21]: But the problem is, when I played that one a little while ago, half the chat room was like, you know, they were going into convulsions.

02:39:30.818 --> 02:39:32.459
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm kind of at a tough space here.

02:39:32.819 --> 02:39:34.100
[SPEAKER_21]: So yes, we'll play them.

02:39:35.084 --> 02:39:38.527
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll intermix them with the other stuff, but we can't play them all in one big clump.

02:39:41.329 --> 02:39:44.351
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki says we can play them on February 30th.

02:39:44.711 --> 02:39:46.052
[SPEAKER_21]: No, we'll play some after the show.

02:39:46.072 --> 02:39:48.434
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll intermix it in with our typical Bomani music.

02:39:48.474 --> 02:39:48.834
[SPEAKER_21]: How's that?

02:39:49.014 --> 02:39:49.815
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll compromise.

02:39:50.475 --> 02:39:52.757
[SPEAKER_21]: Because there are some folks out there that like that stuff, which is cool.

02:39:52.797 --> 02:39:53.417
[SPEAKER_21]: I like some of it.

02:39:53.437 --> 02:39:55.178
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't like all of it, but I like some of it.

02:39:55.218 --> 02:39:57.300
[SPEAKER_21]: But there was some good sounding stuff in there.

02:39:58.203 --> 02:39:59.503
[SPEAKER_21]: So, we shall soon see.

02:39:59.523 --> 02:40:00.043
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, Rob?

02:40:00.283 --> 02:40:00.483
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes?

02:40:00.964 --> 02:40:02.004
[SPEAKER_15]: I like kinky sex.

02:40:02.064 --> 02:40:06.625
[SPEAKER_15]: Are we going to compromise and allow me to have kinky sex on the show every now and then and mix that into the weekly programming?

02:40:06.825 --> 02:40:08.005
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, we might be able to arrange that.

02:40:08.305 --> 02:40:09.865
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, we'll boost our ratings.

02:40:09.885 --> 02:40:09.965
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

02:40:12.026 --> 02:40:12.806
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, let's see.

02:40:13.006 --> 02:40:15.466
[SPEAKER_21]: This is a question probably Loki would be best to answer.

02:40:15.666 --> 02:40:16.946
[SPEAKER_21]: This one for Loki.

02:40:17.266 --> 02:40:25.568
[SPEAKER_21]: This is from SnubDisponoid, and he wants to know, Does the PSX dex drive not work with Windblow's XP, or does mine just hate me?

02:40:26.008 --> 02:40:28.551
[SPEAKER_20]: Yours just hates you because I have Windows XP and mine works fine.

02:40:28.852 --> 02:40:29.572
[SPEAKER_20]: Here's what I do, though.

02:40:29.632 --> 02:40:31.715
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't use the stupid program that it comes with.

02:40:31.775 --> 02:40:35.139
[SPEAKER_20]: I use a program called... Fuck, I can't remember the name.

02:40:38.246 --> 02:40:43.468
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I use a program called... Called... My screensaver's on and now my computer isn't responding.

02:40:43.708 --> 02:40:44.208
[SPEAKER_20]: Hold on.

02:40:44.708 --> 02:40:48.970
[SPEAKER_20]: It's called... PSX Game Edit.

02:40:49.830 --> 02:40:51.331
[SPEAKER_20]: Or, yeah, Game Edit.

02:40:51.371 --> 02:40:52.631
[SPEAKER_20]: PSX Game Edit.

02:40:52.731 --> 02:40:56.293
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's a nice little program that you can use for copying your edits and stuff.

02:40:56.313 --> 02:40:56.793
[SPEAKER_20]: It works fine.

02:40:56.933 --> 02:41:00.054
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, trust me, this thing works on my freaking laptop.

02:41:00.134 --> 02:41:00.874
[SPEAKER_20]: It sucks ass.

02:41:00.934 --> 02:41:02.275
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, it'll work on anything.

02:41:02.984 --> 02:41:08.006
[SPEAKER_15]: If it doesn't work on XP, do not use XP drivers that XP tells you will work.

02:41:08.426 --> 02:41:10.486
[SPEAKER_15]: Go to their website and download a driver off their site.

02:41:10.526 --> 02:41:11.667
[SPEAKER_15]: That might be the problem as well.

02:41:14.448 --> 02:41:15.168
[SPEAKER_21]: You have a question?

02:41:15.668 --> 02:41:17.148
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you can get through everyone else's question.

02:41:17.168 --> 02:41:17.709
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, go ahead.

02:41:17.749 --> 02:41:18.109
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

02:41:18.129 --> 02:41:19.109
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get to theirs eventually.

02:41:19.309 --> 02:41:22.730
[SPEAKER_07]: My question is for you or Matt or Jamie, who's not here.

02:41:23.030 --> 02:41:23.310
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

02:41:23.390 --> 02:41:28.252
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you guys ever going to do the Covers in Classics show and or a request show?

02:41:28.843 --> 02:41:30.444
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:41:52.601 --> 02:41:54.682
[SPEAKER_21]: So what we do is we have season three.

02:41:55.183 --> 02:41:57.964
[SPEAKER_21]: One other thing I wanted to do on top of that is add some more music programming.

02:41:58.024 --> 02:42:03.827
[SPEAKER_21]: We have the long version lunches and late nights that are coming soon to the station, which have been coming soon for like three months.

02:42:03.867 --> 02:42:09.770
[SPEAKER_21]: But anyway, some other things I'd like to do is maybe have like a cover show, like a classic show, like an 80s.

02:42:10.110 --> 02:42:16.574
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, the thing is that I don't want to compete with anything that Under Station Live does because they're kind of the birthplace of this.

02:42:16.614 --> 02:42:18.655
[SPEAKER_21]: And they have an 80s show now on understationlive.org.

02:42:19.435 --> 02:42:21.937
[SPEAKER_21]: So it would be more of a classic show.

02:42:22.597 --> 02:42:24.938
[SPEAKER_07]: Not just 80s, but early 90s dance stuff.

02:42:24.958 --> 02:42:26.239
[SPEAKER_07]: And more dance songs.

02:42:26.339 --> 02:42:27.460
[SPEAKER_07]: Not gothy songs.

02:42:27.560 --> 02:42:30.041
[SPEAKER_07]: The songs that they covered in DDR.

02:42:30.061 --> 02:42:32.002
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have to be strictly 80s.

02:42:32.302 --> 02:42:34.244
[SPEAKER_07]: Or like a request show, like I said.

02:42:34.504 --> 02:42:35.624
[SPEAKER_21]: I would like to see that happen.

02:42:35.664 --> 02:42:40.427
[SPEAKER_21]: And of course, the request shows are kind of already happening because we do have the live fuck-offs that go on on the station.

02:42:40.747 --> 02:42:41.488
[SPEAKER_21]: But they're not scheduled.

02:42:41.508 --> 02:42:42.068
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the only problem.

02:42:42.208 --> 02:42:45.370
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, like an actual 6.30 to 9.30 Sunday request.

02:42:45.470 --> 02:42:47.611
[SPEAKER_21]: It's possible, but it just depends.

02:42:47.631 --> 02:43:02.020
[SPEAKER_21]: The problem is, Loki, myself, DarkSakura, we dedicate a lot of time to the station as it is, and I think while we're willing to dedicate more, certainly it's kind of hard for us to sit there and go like, okay, I'm going to do it Tuesday at 6, you know, it's kind of hard to take away.

02:43:02.040 --> 02:43:07.563
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like an actual, on a Sunday, you know, like an actual official show for a request as opposed to a fuck-off.

02:43:07.583 --> 02:43:08.243
[SPEAKER_07]: Possibly, possibly.

02:43:08.343 --> 02:43:09.524
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't you have an intern?

02:43:09.984 --> 02:43:11.025
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we do have an intern.

02:43:11.185 --> 02:43:12.646
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, and certainly he can.

02:43:13.627 --> 02:43:15.749
[SPEAKER_21]: And we have other people that want to go live on our station too.

02:43:15.769 --> 02:43:22.293
[SPEAKER_21]: We just have to figure out how to work all that out fairly without taking away from the rest of Orange Lounge.

02:43:22.954 --> 02:43:26.096
[SPEAKER_21]: Not turning it into an egothon, I guess I should say.

02:43:26.397 --> 02:43:30.880
[SPEAKER_21]: Because then everybody, if one person, we let one audience member go live, then everybody's going to want to go live.

02:43:30.900 --> 02:43:37.365
[SPEAKER_21]: So we have to find a way to figure out how to do it fair while it still holds the high quality of Orange Lounge Radio and all that stuff.

02:43:37.465 --> 02:43:38.446
[SPEAKER_21]: So we'll figure it out.

02:43:38.866 --> 02:43:42.030
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just talking to Anita and I reminded myself of another fuck you I have to have, alright?

02:43:42.350 --> 02:43:43.251
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, go for it.

02:43:43.271 --> 02:43:45.254
[SPEAKER_15]: This is fuck you to my parents, alright?

02:43:46.395 --> 02:43:47.576
[SPEAKER_15]: And my family for that matter.

02:43:47.957 --> 02:43:51.020
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I've only known Anita for like three weeks.

02:43:51.100 --> 02:43:53.403
[SPEAKER_15]: Stop asking me, is she marriage material?

02:43:53.623 --> 02:43:54.624
[SPEAKER_15]: Is she going to have kids?

02:43:54.644 --> 02:43:55.646
[SPEAKER_15]: Does she want to have kids?

02:43:56.567 --> 02:43:57.928
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are good birthing hints.

02:44:00.663 --> 02:44:01.343
[SPEAKER_20]: That's another thing.

02:44:01.403 --> 02:44:04.545
[SPEAKER_20]: My ex keeps emailing me, and she keeps asking me the same question.

02:44:04.565 --> 02:44:05.665
[SPEAKER_20]: I said, are you going to marry Nellie?

02:44:05.685 --> 02:44:06.466
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you going to marry her?

02:44:07.246 --> 02:44:13.789
[SPEAKER_20]: Just because you broke up with me and got married, like, a couple weeks later, doesn't mean that I'm going to go out and get married right away.

02:44:13.869 --> 02:44:26.035
[SPEAKER_20]: Just because you're a freaking Jesus freak, okay, and have to be, like, have some commitment issues, and are living in Chico, you know, and your potential is a pet, what was it?

02:44:26.095 --> 02:44:27.896
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a veterinarian secretary.

02:44:29.837 --> 02:44:29.997
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

02:44:31.758 --> 02:44:37.002
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so that fuck you is for you mom and Eugene and you Aunt Mickey and you Uncle Zach.

02:44:37.243 --> 02:44:37.903
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck all of you.

02:44:38.103 --> 02:44:41.206
[SPEAKER_21]: Happy Mother's Day from Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:43.108 --> 02:44:43.748
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, moving on.

02:44:44.128 --> 02:44:44.969
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you had another question, Irene?

02:44:44.989 --> 02:44:45.129
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

02:44:45.450 --> 02:44:45.690
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

02:44:45.810 --> 02:44:46.430
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just taking the mic.

02:44:47.571 --> 02:44:48.832
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's move on then, shall we?

02:44:49.213 --> 02:44:49.533
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

02:44:54.207 --> 02:45:02.730
[SPEAKER_21]: Next question is, Dark Tetsuya would like to know, will you ever get around to adding more Vanessa May, speaking of which?

02:45:03.990 --> 02:45:10.553
[SPEAKER_21]: The only problem with adding more Vanessa May is that she hasn't really done anything else, Dance Mania, things like that.

02:45:12.294 --> 02:45:16.718
[SPEAKER_21]: Except for a really, really horrible track of Vanessa May, which I think appears on Dance Mania 7.

02:45:17.299 --> 02:45:23.806
[SPEAKER_21]: But even Dark Tetsuya, the complete Vanessa May whore agrees, that song is of the suck, and it will never be played again on Orange Ones Radio.

02:45:25.868 --> 02:45:30.673
[SPEAKER_21]: But we do have some random stuff that appears, so I don't see why we can't add one or two more Vanessa May songs, just because she rocks.

02:45:31.275 --> 02:45:38.796
[SPEAKER_21]: But I've got to find something more techno-y, upbeat, that fits into the groove of the rest of the station.

02:45:39.456 --> 02:45:43.897
[SPEAKER_21]: Something like, there's a song called White Bird that's remixed by Airscape, that's pretty good.

02:45:44.197 --> 02:45:45.978
[SPEAKER_21]: And Airscape is actually Bomani related too.

02:45:46.798 --> 02:45:48.158
[SPEAKER_21]: White Bird's pretty good, so I might add that.

02:45:48.918 --> 02:45:50.778
[SPEAKER_21]: But as far as like, it's got to be something dance-y.

02:45:50.798 --> 02:45:53.919
[SPEAKER_21]: If you have some dance-y Vanessa May songs, certainly send them, we'll think about adding them.

02:45:54.919 --> 02:45:59.440
[SPEAKER_21]: But there is some good, and she does have that Cotton Eye Joe, and that does relate to Bomani in a roundabout way, so...

02:46:00.385 --> 02:46:06.631
[SPEAKER_21]: But for the time being, I think it's just going to be a fuck-offs, and then we'll try to get at least one more Vanessa May track.

02:46:06.651 --> 02:46:09.033
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I know Fantasia's getting a little stale, but you know what you need to do?

02:46:09.253 --> 02:46:13.157
[SPEAKER_21]: You need to write Vanessa May and tell her to let herself appear on more Tanzania albums.

02:46:13.437 --> 02:46:17.101
[SPEAKER_19]: Or you could just say, oh wait, Vanessa May sucks, and I don't really give a shit about her.

02:46:17.261 --> 02:46:17.921
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, shut up.

02:46:18.622 --> 02:46:21.144
[SPEAKER_15]: Or you could write her and tell her to stop making crap music.

02:46:21.905 --> 02:46:22.786
[SPEAKER_21]: You guys are awful.

02:46:23.226 --> 02:46:24.347
[SPEAKER_19]: Vanessa May's a piece of shit.

02:46:24.427 --> 02:46:25.108
[SPEAKER_21]: And guess what?

02:46:25.208 --> 02:46:25.789
[SPEAKER_21]: We just...

02:46:26.770 --> 02:46:27.811
[SPEAKER_21]: We just net split.

02:46:28.051 --> 02:46:29.852
[SPEAKER_21]: Our chat rooms are going through a net split right now.

02:46:30.373 --> 02:46:36.077
[SPEAKER_21]: So if you're on the other side of the net split, you guys can email your questions right now too.

02:46:36.137 --> 02:46:37.778
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll keep an eye on the email box, okay?

02:46:38.339 --> 02:46:43.523
[SPEAKER_21]: Email your questions to orangeloungeradio, that's all one word, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.

02:46:43.783 --> 02:46:51.208
[SPEAKER_21]: A net split is when the servers, one of the servers, like a chat room has like 10 different servers all funneling into the chat room.

02:46:51.549 --> 02:46:53.210
[SPEAKER_21]: That's when like half those servers break off.

02:46:53.670 --> 02:46:55.270
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, they stopped talking to each other.

02:46:55.310 --> 02:46:55.630
[SPEAKER_19]: They crashed.

02:46:55.650 --> 02:46:56.631
[SPEAKER_19]: Even one server can break off.

02:46:56.691 --> 02:46:56.791
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

02:46:56.811 --> 02:46:58.291
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the link between a bunch of the servers.

02:46:58.311 --> 02:46:58.671
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.

02:46:58.931 --> 02:47:03.232
[SPEAKER_19]: And that causes a bunch of the other people to suddenly look like they quit, but they didn't quit.

02:47:03.352 --> 02:47:05.252
[SPEAKER_19]: They're still online, but they're on some other server.

02:47:05.272 --> 02:47:06.912
[SPEAKER_19]: So you lost the link between a bunch of those people.

02:47:07.352 --> 02:47:11.093
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm sure people who are listening right now understand that already, but this is for people who didn't understand.

02:47:11.393 --> 02:47:11.833
[SPEAKER_19]: You never know.

02:47:12.253 --> 02:47:13.013
[SPEAKER_19]: In the... You never know.

02:47:13.353 --> 02:47:16.154
[SPEAKER_21]: We have some people who are new to our chatroom who may not understand the Nesplay.

02:47:16.174 --> 02:47:17.454
[SPEAKER_21]: We get new people on our chatroom every week.

02:47:17.474 --> 02:47:17.934
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello to you.

02:47:18.194 --> 02:47:22.795
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you want to join our chatroom, just head on over to Calibamonte.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on Chat.

02:47:24.346 --> 02:47:25.729
[SPEAKER_15]: That was a very nice segue Rob.

02:47:25.749 --> 02:47:26.069
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

02:47:39.082 --> 02:47:44.586
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, anyways, my site, a couple things are going to happen.

02:47:44.686 --> 02:47:46.667
[SPEAKER_20]: First off, I need to actually do an update.

02:47:49.029 --> 02:47:57.234
[SPEAKER_20]: I also noticed that there's a few files missing on there that need to be on there because I was going through my stuff and there's a few things I forgot to move over in the appropriate folders and zip up and whatnot.

02:47:57.594 --> 02:48:01.197
[SPEAKER_20]: But anyways, another thing that's coming to my site is forums.

02:48:01.677 --> 02:48:05.079
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I actually purchased forums and I will have forums soon.

02:48:05.199 --> 02:48:07.801
[SPEAKER_20]: I just have to scan them and then we're ready to go.

02:48:08.041 --> 02:48:09.202
[SPEAKER_21]: Has to give him some clothes.

02:48:09.862 --> 02:48:10.103
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

02:48:10.503 --> 02:48:10.783
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

02:48:12.845 --> 02:48:17.828
[SPEAKER_21]: Good question coming to us from AkumaGM, who is getting us to talk about some Bomani.

02:48:18.849 --> 02:48:23.772
[SPEAKER_21]: Will the release of DDRXbox produce some enjoyable, downloadable content?

02:48:24.853 --> 02:48:25.714
[SPEAKER_21]: Interesting question.

02:48:25.914 --> 02:48:26.715
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki says yes.

02:48:27.595 --> 02:48:29.457
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't know there was going to be a DDRXbox.

02:48:29.477 --> 02:48:31.298
[SPEAKER_21]: You need to listen to this show more often, Brad.

02:48:31.398 --> 02:48:31.858
[SPEAKER_19]: Fuck you.

02:48:31.938 --> 02:48:32.499
[SPEAKER_19]: What is this show?

02:48:33.857 --> 02:48:34.638
[SPEAKER_15]: Content, yes.

02:48:34.718 --> 02:48:35.358
[SPEAKER_15]: Enjoyable, no.

02:48:35.518 --> 02:48:37.019
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, fuck you, Xbox.

02:48:37.299 --> 02:48:40.341
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck you, listener or chat person for mentioning the Xbox.

02:48:40.741 --> 02:48:41.762
[SPEAKER_15]: Xbox sucks.

02:48:42.262 --> 02:48:52.648
[SPEAKER_15]: The only game you should ever buy on Xbox other than Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball just for the jiggliness or Outlaw Volleyball for the jiggliness is Psychonauts because my friend is making that game and it's going to be badass.

02:48:52.668 --> 02:48:54.329
[SPEAKER_15]: But other than that, Xbox sucks.

02:48:54.490 --> 02:48:58.472
[SPEAKER_15]: It makes a better Linux machine and they finally hacked it with Linux without putting a mod chip in.

02:48:59.662 --> 02:49:02.926
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, before we continue, because I'm going to play the devil's advocate here.

02:49:03.207 --> 02:49:05.149
[SPEAKER_19]: We all know the console war will never end.

02:49:05.529 --> 02:49:10.456
[SPEAKER_19]: I personally don't hate, or I personally don't like Xbox, but I don't want to piss off a bunch of people by saying that.

02:49:11.036 --> 02:49:18.566
[SPEAKER_20]: They did this Xbox propaganda thing on G4 this morning, talking about how it's so great and everything, and how it's... No.

02:49:20.575 --> 02:49:24.359
[SPEAKER_21]: To quote Ryan, Xbox would be better served as a weapon to hit 10 year old children with.

02:49:40.010 --> 02:49:40.410
[SPEAKER_19]: DirectX Box

02:49:58.519 --> 02:49:58.960
[SPEAKER_19]: Konami.

02:49:59.200 --> 02:50:00.421
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's all write letters to Konami.

02:50:00.862 --> 02:50:09.672
[SPEAKER_19]: Instead of wasting your production time to make stupid Xbox ports of Bomani games, why don't you put your time into making 7th style for home PS2?

02:50:09.812 --> 02:50:12.375
[SPEAKER_19]: So we can have 2DX at home again.

02:50:13.637 --> 02:50:16.600
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I don't care if it's US or Japanese, I want more 2DX at home.

02:50:16.620 --> 02:50:18.523
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, this is the problem.

02:50:19.306 --> 02:50:19.906
[SPEAKER_21]: This is the problem.

02:50:20.646 --> 02:50:24.307
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, DDR Xbox will have enjoyable, downloadable content.

02:50:24.467 --> 02:50:29.148
[SPEAKER_21]: And in fact, I predict DDR Xbox is going to be the best fucking DDR game they've done yet.

02:50:29.448 --> 02:50:30.028
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you know why?

02:50:30.408 --> 02:50:33.289
[SPEAKER_21]: Because we're all sitting here bitching about how we're not going to buy it and support the Xbox.

02:50:33.609 --> 02:50:34.989
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's the way God works.

02:50:35.850 --> 02:50:38.470
[SPEAKER_15]: It will probably have enjoyable, downloadable content.

02:50:38.990 --> 02:50:43.331
[SPEAKER_15]: At the price of $50 a month in addition to your normal cost of the game for Xbox Live.

02:50:45.072 --> 02:50:46.092
[SPEAKER_15]: Xbox Live is $50 a month?

02:50:51.888 --> 02:50:54.730
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, it's going to cost me $15 a month to play EverQuest 2.

02:50:54.790 --> 02:50:57.251
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not going to pay $50 for Xbox Live.

02:50:58.072 --> 02:51:00.013
[SPEAKER_20]: All we're going to do is make the DWIs in a few days.

02:51:00.393 --> 02:51:07.097
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, speaking of which, unless someone beats me to it, I'm making the DWIs for the Max to Exclusive songs.

02:51:07.977 --> 02:51:09.518
[SPEAKER_20]: Those will be coming out probably pretty soon.

02:51:10.098 --> 02:51:12.060
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm really shocked those haven't already been done.

02:51:12.400 --> 02:51:15.361
[SPEAKER_20]: People have just been lazy, actually, and haven't gotten their game or just don't care.

02:51:15.481 --> 02:51:16.342
[SPEAKER_20]: I can make mine, like...

02:51:17.743 --> 02:51:19.985
[SPEAKER_20]: I can make them the night if I wanted to.

02:51:20.005 --> 02:51:22.487
[SPEAKER_20]: The question is do I want to.

02:51:24.443 --> 02:51:29.326
[SPEAKER_21]: The next question is from SoCalKicks, and I accidentally closed his window, but I sort of remember what it said.

02:51:29.346 --> 02:51:31.047
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I remember that guy, a long time ago.

02:51:31.067 --> 02:51:34.549
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I know, he has disappeared, but he actually asked a question.

02:51:34.890 --> 02:51:39.252
[SPEAKER_21]: For those who may not remember SoCalKicks, let me play a little something.

02:51:39.272 --> 02:51:43.555
[SPEAKER_20]: Bastion has a bigger mall than we do, and it's cooler, and they have a Dave and Buster's there.

02:51:44.235 --> 02:51:46.196
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, we met SoCalKicks some time ago.

02:51:46.257 --> 02:51:49.238
[SPEAKER_20]: They have a guy that gives massages in the mall, and it was, ah, so good.

02:51:50.499 --> 02:51:53.381
[SPEAKER_21]: For those of you that forget SoCalKicks, here's a little reminder.

02:51:57.213 --> 02:51:58.633
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody, this is DSDS.

02:51:58.673 --> 02:52:02.474
[SPEAKER_16]: Make sure to visit SoCalKicks.com and you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:52:02.694 --> 02:52:05.674
[SPEAKER_16]: We finally accomplished ultimate evolution just now.

02:52:06.655 --> 02:52:10.295
[SPEAKER_21]: You know how many times I had to get him to say his own little motto for his website?

02:52:11.135 --> 02:52:11.395
[SPEAKER_21]: Twice.

02:52:11.555 --> 02:52:18.997
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, he wants to know, why is it that I'm not listening to this station anymore, even though I have an urge to?

02:52:23.197 --> 02:52:25.278
[SPEAKER_15]: Because SoCalKicks, you suck.

02:52:28.246 --> 02:52:28.866
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know about that.

02:52:28.926 --> 02:52:29.787
[SPEAKER_19]: He seemed like a pretty cool guy.

02:52:29.947 --> 02:52:32.768
[SPEAKER_21]: I say he's just discovered the joys of masturbation.

02:52:33.508 --> 02:52:36.789
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, spending a lot more time with Rosie Palmer and her five sisters?

02:52:36.989 --> 02:52:38.510
[SPEAKER_21]: I hope the window's not open still, is it?

02:52:38.650 --> 02:52:42.432
[SPEAKER_20]: That is no excuse whatsoever if you're listening to the radio.

02:52:42.832 --> 02:52:45.793
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, that requires no hands at all.

02:52:46.821 --> 02:52:55.703
[SPEAKER_15]: Even if you're one-handed, you one-hand it to live365.com, you one-hand click Orange Lounge, one-click the play, and then your hand's free.

02:52:56.163 --> 02:52:59.204
[SPEAKER_15]: But you can even put Flash videos up and watch those at the same time.

02:52:59.944 --> 02:53:01.965
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we got a new sweeper here with Dark Child.

02:53:02.565 --> 02:53:03.385
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on, man.

02:53:04.205 --> 02:53:07.766
[SPEAKER_20]: Shit, man, you could probably play Step Mania and beat off at the same time.

02:53:10.051 --> 02:53:11.212
[SPEAKER_15]: It seems possible.

02:53:11.732 --> 02:53:14.094
[SPEAKER_15]: You could probably beat off and play 5-key Beatmania too.

02:53:14.114 --> 02:53:15.775
[SPEAKER_15]: 7-key is a little hard.

02:53:15.815 --> 02:53:19.897
[SPEAKER_19]: He's playing 5-key Beatmania with his penis.

02:53:20.057 --> 02:53:23.860
[SPEAKER_19]: That was playing one-handed.

02:53:24.960 --> 02:53:28.402
[SPEAKER_19]: That song you played, the DWI, was like, how long?

02:53:28.422 --> 02:53:29.223
[SPEAKER_19]: 45 minutes?

02:53:30.443 --> 02:53:32.825
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that made your hand more tired than masturbating, I'm sure.

02:53:34.986 --> 02:53:36.407
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a workout for my right hand.

02:53:37.580 --> 02:53:49.784
[SPEAKER_19]: I did also perfect combo the beauty of silence one-handed, so... The beauty of... I full comboed the skin flute one-handed.

02:53:51.204 --> 02:53:52.345
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, flute man, I mean.

02:53:52.485 --> 02:53:53.025
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the song.

02:53:54.286 --> 02:53:55.366
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, moving right along.

02:53:55.866 --> 02:54:00.428
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm waiting to get yelled at for that answer, but since he's not listening, he won't hear it unless somebody communicates it to him.

02:54:00.748 --> 02:54:05.869
[SPEAKER_21]: And right now he's probably getting 20 messages from tattletales going, They're teasing you about masturbation!

02:54:06.749 --> 02:54:08.109
[SPEAKER_19]: Where's he from again?

02:54:08.129 --> 02:54:08.970
[SPEAKER_19]: He's from Fremont?

02:54:09.490 --> 02:54:11.090
[SPEAKER_21]: Hence the name SoCalKicks.

02:54:11.750 --> 02:54:13.691
[SPEAKER_21]: SoCalKicks means he's from, you know, Hawaii.

02:54:13.731 --> 02:54:16.472
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought he was in, like, Amsterdam or something, you dumbass.

02:54:17.032 --> 02:54:18.772
[SPEAKER_15]: Is he part of, like, Team Change-O-Land?

02:54:18.792 --> 02:54:21.933
[SPEAKER_15]: Because, I mean, they could teach him how to masturbate properly while he sits on the radio.

02:54:24.264 --> 02:54:26.445
[SPEAKER_21]: In fact, don't they have a radio show there?

02:54:27.365 --> 02:54:27.765
[SPEAKER_21]: Who knows?

02:54:27.865 --> 02:54:28.526
[SPEAKER_21]: Nobody listens.

02:54:29.906 --> 02:54:30.266
[SPEAKER_21]: That's okay.

02:54:30.286 --> 02:54:31.166
[SPEAKER_21]: Nobody listens to this either.

02:54:31.787 --> 02:54:32.467
[SPEAKER_19]: More than them.

02:54:32.827 --> 02:54:34.027
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, anyway.

02:54:34.528 --> 02:54:35.068
[SPEAKER_21]: Be nice.

02:54:35.748 --> 02:54:36.328
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I'll be nice.

02:54:38.449 --> 02:54:39.309
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, new question.

02:54:39.329 --> 02:54:39.769
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, listen.

02:54:40.209 --> 02:54:40.649
[SPEAKER_21]: New question.

02:54:40.669 --> 02:54:41.570
[SPEAKER_21]: Here we go.

02:54:41.630 --> 02:54:47.132
[SPEAKER_21]: John Fields wants to know, psychology or ethnic conflicts of the 20th century?

02:54:47.932 --> 02:54:48.952
[SPEAKER_21]: Which category for Jeopardy?

02:54:49.012 --> 02:54:49.152
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

02:54:49.412 --> 02:54:51.433
[SPEAKER_21]: He wants to know, which essay should I start next?

02:54:53.248 --> 02:54:57.811
[SPEAKER_21]: Psychology or... Ethnic conflicts of the 20th century.

02:54:59.552 --> 02:55:01.853
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I say, I mean, these people are yelling psychology.

02:55:02.153 --> 02:55:10.538
[SPEAKER_15]: Do the ethnic whatever, because you're going to rack your brain on that shit, and then you could actually use some of the dilemmas you'll have in your psychology paper.

02:55:10.978 --> 02:55:11.359
[SPEAKER_21]: I agree.

02:55:11.399 --> 02:55:16.802
[SPEAKER_21]: I think since psychology sounds like the easier one, do that second, so that you coast down through the second paper.

02:55:16.882 --> 02:55:20.084
[SPEAKER_19]: I say plagiarize a Dr. Phil episode, and there you go.

02:55:22.159 --> 02:55:25.782
[SPEAKER_18]: I say do the psychology if you're going to put all that work into it, at least learn how to fuck with people's heads.

02:55:25.802 --> 02:55:28.864
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait a minute, what were the two topics again?

02:55:29.344 --> 02:55:32.747
[SPEAKER_21]: Psychology or ethnic conflicts of the 20th century.

02:55:32.967 --> 02:55:39.291
[SPEAKER_15]: Why not do a psychology paper about the ethnic conflicts of the 20th century and then print it out twice and turn it into both classes?

02:55:39.732 --> 02:55:40.912
[SPEAKER_21]: Beautiful, there you go.

02:55:40.992 --> 02:55:41.753
[SPEAKER_21]: There's your answer.

02:55:43.814 --> 02:55:44.895
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

02:55:46.757 --> 02:55:49.939
[SPEAKER_21]: DDR Angel has a question for Loki.

02:55:51.286 --> 02:55:53.147
[SPEAKER_21]: This is a question for Loki from DDR Angel.

02:55:53.808 --> 02:55:54.528
[SPEAKER_21]: Will you marry me?

02:55:54.588 --> 02:55:55.128
[SPEAKER_21]: No, just kidding.

02:55:57.010 --> 02:55:59.471
[SPEAKER_21]: That question's reserved for someone else in our chat room.

02:55:59.511 --> 02:56:00.472
[SPEAKER_21]: We won't talk about that.

02:56:00.592 --> 02:56:01.112
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just kidding.

02:56:01.172 --> 02:56:02.293
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh God, I'm so going to get smacked.

02:56:02.913 --> 02:56:07.656
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm like just waiting for the buffer to get there.

02:56:08.617 --> 02:56:08.957
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

02:56:10.257 --> 02:56:11.658
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

02:56:12.179 --> 02:56:12.499
[SPEAKER_21]: Never mind.

02:56:12.539 --> 02:56:13.740
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, here's the real question.

02:56:15.080 --> 02:56:16.101
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, there, I just got smacked.

02:56:17.042 --> 02:56:17.302
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

02:56:18.403 --> 02:56:20.305
[SPEAKER_21]: When are you going to get to do a fuck-off?

02:56:20.405 --> 02:56:22.166
[SPEAKER_21]: We need your mix, Mastinus.

02:56:22.886 --> 02:56:23.727
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, let's see here.

02:56:23.787 --> 02:56:26.789
[SPEAKER_20]: First off, I need to get broadband hooked up to my computer.

02:56:27.029 --> 02:56:30.292
[SPEAKER_20]: Since it doesn't seem to be happening at the moment, it's not for a while.

02:56:30.312 --> 02:56:31.292
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

02:56:32.834 --> 02:56:33.034
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

02:56:33.294 --> 02:56:33.814
[SPEAKER_21]: Eventually.

02:56:34.195 --> 02:56:38.738
[SPEAKER_21]: It is something that will be coming to... In fact, we're hoping... This goes back to Irene's question earlier.

02:56:39.719 --> 02:56:41.520
[SPEAKER_21]: Hopefully, Loki will be...

02:56:42.290 --> 02:56:45.254
[SPEAKER_21]: Doing a regular show, like it'll be like every week at a certain time, right?

02:56:45.354 --> 02:56:48.859
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, there was going to be a mixed show, but you know, there's kind of a couple problems with that.

02:56:48.939 --> 02:56:50.581
[SPEAKER_20]: First off, I don't know how to mix.

02:56:54.226 --> 02:56:56.048
[SPEAKER_20]: So we need to kind of figure that one out first.

02:56:56.989 --> 02:57:00.654
[SPEAKER_15]: I can almost match, maybe you could fix that almost part and then you could do it.

02:57:02.561 --> 02:57:03.002
[SPEAKER_20]: I can do it.

02:57:03.022 --> 02:57:08.427
[SPEAKER_20]: I honestly have to go through all my records and mark down what the BPM is on in all of them.

02:57:09.608 --> 02:57:13.332
[SPEAKER_20]: And then I have to listen to all of them numerous times, which is going to be a bitch.

02:57:13.992 --> 02:57:19.678
[SPEAKER_20]: So I know what songs sound the same, beat-wise and bass-wise, so I can mix them together.

02:57:23.516 --> 02:57:26.177
[SPEAKER_15]: And you already know about, like, filter out to just the bass.

02:57:26.197 --> 02:57:31.038
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to get through these last couple questions before we have to end the show here.

02:57:32.358 --> 02:57:33.919
[SPEAKER_21]: Ah, return of a classic.

02:57:33.979 --> 02:57:35.099
[SPEAKER_21]: This question's for Bradley.

02:57:35.379 --> 02:57:35.739
[SPEAKER_21]: Penis.

02:57:36.279 --> 02:57:46.842
[SPEAKER_21]: And this question's been asked to a lot of people on the show, but 23rd Magus wants to know, Bradley, what would you do with two quiet Jap girls, a bucket of Choco Ready Whip, a cake pie, and a 2DX controller?

02:57:50.390 --> 02:57:51.711
[SPEAKER_18]: Our child wants to answer this too.

02:57:52.212 --> 02:57:55.774
[SPEAKER_18]: I probably go crazy and just not know what to do.

02:57:55.834 --> 02:57:58.397
[SPEAKER_18]: I just kind of sit in the corner and watch them play 2DX.

02:58:00.578 --> 02:58:01.659
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, dude.

02:58:01.699 --> 02:58:04.762
[SPEAKER_18]: And film the whole thing and tell them to do crazy stuff.

02:58:04.982 --> 02:58:05.923
[SPEAKER_15]: It was Chocolate Ready Whip?

02:58:06.823 --> 02:58:08.645
[SPEAKER_15]: I play Beat Mania while eating Chocolate Ready Whip.

02:58:09.625 --> 02:58:10.226
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a good thing to do.

02:58:10.466 --> 02:58:11.367
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, you got it.

02:58:19.474 --> 02:58:21.556
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no, I play Beat Mania.

02:58:23.297 --> 02:58:23.637
[SPEAKER_15]: I get it.

02:58:27.140 --> 02:58:33.044
[SPEAKER_20]: First, I'd accept the video camera, because obviously any situation with that, there would have to be a video camera in the room.

02:58:33.064 --> 02:58:34.606
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'd link to the website with it broadcasting on.

02:58:34.626 --> 02:58:35.186
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, definitely.

02:58:35.486 --> 02:58:36.187
[SPEAKER_20]: Inner broadcast.

02:58:37.428 --> 02:58:38.148
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see here.

02:58:38.168 --> 02:58:39.669
[SPEAKER_20]: Kawaii Japanese Girls.

02:58:40.010 --> 02:58:40.910
[SPEAKER_20]: So impressionable.

02:58:41.171 --> 02:58:41.951
[SPEAKER_20]: And with Ready Whip.

02:58:42.211 --> 02:58:43.252
[SPEAKER_15]: Are they in schoolgirl uniforms?

02:58:43.733 --> 02:58:46.635
[SPEAKER_20]: No, see, they have to be regular Ready Whip, because I don't like chocolate that much.

02:58:46.655 --> 02:58:47.856
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a question for Bradley, guys.

02:58:47.896 --> 02:58:48.196
[SPEAKER_19]: Come on.

02:58:49.042 --> 02:58:55.305
[SPEAKER_18]: This brings up a fuck you to people who use some Japanese words in English, like kawaii girls.

02:58:55.805 --> 02:58:57.386
[SPEAKER_18]: That's really, really fucking annoying.

02:58:57.906 --> 02:59:05.210
[SPEAKER_18]: Especially in this, I get Raijin Magazine, and they have a game and anime thing, and then they bring it out of somewhere out of nowhere.

02:59:05.490 --> 02:59:06.730
[SPEAKER_18]: This game is really kawaii.

02:59:06.750 --> 02:59:07.871
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what I hate?

02:59:07.891 --> 02:59:16.015
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what I hate is when people mispronounce anime and spell it wrong when they email me at work asking me questions about anime.

02:59:16.115 --> 02:59:17.295
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to know about the anima.

02:59:17.655 --> 02:59:18.516
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to know about the...

02:59:20.437 --> 02:59:21.097
[SPEAKER_20]: The enemy.

02:59:21.417 --> 02:59:27.160
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to know about the Japan... I can't even pronounce how they say it.

02:59:27.260 --> 02:59:29.160
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like the Japanimation.

02:59:29.601 --> 02:59:30.301
[SPEAKER_15]: Just write them back.

02:59:30.341 --> 02:59:32.382
[SPEAKER_15]: The enema is up your ass and you are the enemy.

02:59:35.503 --> 02:59:36.503
[SPEAKER_21]: Japaninamco nation?

02:59:36.523 --> 02:59:36.844
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

02:59:36.964 --> 02:59:37.184
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway.

02:59:37.944 --> 02:59:39.325
[SPEAKER_20]: They're like Japanime.

02:59:39.465 --> 02:59:40.325
[SPEAKER_21]: Japanime.

02:59:41.486 --> 02:59:42.026
[SPEAKER_21]: Japanime.

02:59:43.306 --> 02:59:44.327
[SPEAKER_21]: I like that, Japanime.

02:59:44.927 --> 02:59:46.488
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, here we go.

02:59:46.968 --> 02:59:49.669
[SPEAKER_21]: Dartetsuyu would like to know, have you ever played Parodius?

02:59:50.549 --> 02:59:52.070
[SPEAKER_21]: Gogucho, Sexy, etc.

02:59:52.730 --> 02:59:53.411
[SPEAKER_21]: Anybody, I guess.

02:59:53.451 --> 02:59:54.951
[SPEAKER_21]: He didn't direct it towards any particular person.

02:59:57.573 --> 02:59:58.813
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I've played it.

02:59:58.953 --> 03:00:02.315
[SPEAKER_18]: I have like two or three of the games on Saturn, so I've played it sometimes.

03:00:02.355 --> 03:00:04.876
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll tell you right now, I have played Parodius, and it sucks.

03:00:04.936 --> 03:00:05.456
[SPEAKER_19]: Play Gradius.

03:00:05.536 --> 03:00:07.297
[SPEAKER_19]: God.

03:00:07.997 --> 03:00:09.698
[SPEAKER_21]: I've played it for a little bit on Nintendo Emulator.

03:00:10.459 --> 03:00:12.520
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, come on, don't play Gradius, play Life Force.

03:00:13.721 --> 03:00:14.521
[SPEAKER_19]: Salamander, you mean?

03:00:15.221 --> 03:00:15.902
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what I love?

03:00:16.082 --> 03:00:18.643
[SPEAKER_21]: I love most about Parodius as the penguins.

03:00:20.784 --> 03:00:25.986
[SPEAKER_19]: Just what you're playing, I don't know, I just, I think Gradius is still the classic Konami shooter.

03:00:27.407 --> 03:00:29.188
[SPEAKER_19]: It's got burning heat in it, Gradius 2, so.

03:00:30.989 --> 03:00:34.550
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, well, there's going to be a Gradius, what is it, 5 on PS2?

03:00:35.310 --> 03:00:36.171
[SPEAKER_19]: That should be interesting.

03:00:37.291 --> 03:00:38.432
[SPEAKER_19]: I hope they make it like, uh,

03:00:39.545 --> 03:00:40.325
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it'll be good.

03:00:42.206 --> 03:00:43.546
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yes, the new Contra.

03:00:44.266 --> 03:00:44.927
[SPEAKER_19]: I haven't played it yet.

03:00:46.527 --> 03:00:46.747
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

03:00:47.767 --> 03:00:48.308
[SPEAKER_19]: Bad radio.

03:00:48.488 --> 03:00:49.468
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, sorry.

03:00:49.828 --> 03:00:56.410
[SPEAKER_21]: UK Bondage Boy wanted to back up something that Bradley had said in the last bit about Japan English.

03:00:57.510 --> 03:00:59.791
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like having the screen name Nico Bubblegum.

03:01:00.131 --> 03:01:02.652
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, let's be multicultural and trendy.

03:01:02.672 --> 03:01:02.932
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, Rob.

03:01:08.064 --> 03:01:09.185
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, last question.

03:01:09.705 --> 03:01:11.246
[SPEAKER_21]: Last question for Ask Orange Lounge.

03:01:11.266 --> 03:01:11.887
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, everybody.

03:01:12.527 --> 03:01:17.070
[SPEAKER_21]: The last question is from Justin B. He wants to know, when will this show ever end?

03:01:17.930 --> 03:01:18.971
[SPEAKER_21]: The answer is right now.

03:01:19.031 --> 03:01:21.012
[SPEAKER_21]: So let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

03:01:21.473 --> 03:01:22.193
[SPEAKER_15]: Final thought.

03:01:26.416 --> 03:01:32.339
[SPEAKER_15]: I know way too much things about my mother that I wish I never knew or heard uttered from her mouth.

03:01:32.360 --> 03:01:33.060
[SPEAKER_16]: Diddy Garholic.

03:01:37.046 --> 03:01:39.107
[SPEAKER_06]: English is very, very nice fun.

03:01:39.327 --> 03:01:39.747
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

03:01:41.148 --> 03:01:42.429
[SPEAKER_21]: You want to go now, Loki, or at the end?

03:01:42.909 --> 03:01:43.570
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't care, whatever.

03:01:43.590 --> 03:01:44.070
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, Loki.

03:01:45.411 --> 03:01:46.451
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, I guess I'm going now.

03:01:46.871 --> 03:01:52.335
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't believe I missed Simpsons, and the TV is right here, but I was watching Most Extremely Nation Challenge, which I saw yesterday.

03:01:53.015 --> 03:01:53.475
[SPEAKER_20]: Go fig.

03:01:55.096 --> 03:01:55.596
[SPEAKER_20]: Whatever.

03:01:55.857 --> 03:02:00.219
[SPEAKER_20]: I said, like, I was going to watch it every week now that I had the TV and cable, but no.

03:02:00.679 --> 03:02:01.320
[SPEAKER_20]: Had to be stupid.

03:02:01.360 --> 03:02:01.660
[SPEAKER_20]: Whatever.

03:02:03.191 --> 03:02:05.593
[SPEAKER_21]: TheWretchedEvilIceQueen, and Haggad.

03:02:08.696 --> 03:02:09.016
[SPEAKER_21]: That's it?

03:02:10.538 --> 03:02:12.700
[SPEAKER_21]: Just deep panting for the Ice Queen.

03:02:13.560 --> 03:02:14.241
[SPEAKER_19]: Take her now.

03:02:14.501 --> 03:02:16.423
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a very serious final thought, everybody.

03:02:16.683 --> 03:02:17.144
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, Brad?

03:02:17.184 --> 03:02:17.604
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody!

03:02:19.646 --> 03:02:21.888
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody, this is a serious... Come on!

03:02:22.929 --> 03:02:23.950
[SPEAKER_19]: Very serious final thought.

03:02:24.980 --> 03:02:28.902
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't care if you believe in God or any religion or praying at all.

03:02:29.562 --> 03:02:34.804
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody please pray to Konami that Castlevania for PS2 is going to be a good game.

03:02:35.184 --> 03:02:35.965
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not going to suck.

03:02:36.325 --> 03:02:37.385
[SPEAKER_19]: It is very serious.

03:02:37.485 --> 03:02:38.206
[SPEAKER_19]: I am very serious.

03:02:38.246 --> 03:02:39.026
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody, please.

03:02:39.506 --> 03:02:39.847
Amen.

03:02:40.387 --> 03:02:40.667
[SPEAKER_19]: Amen.

03:02:40.687 --> 03:02:41.827
[SPEAKER_19]: Can I get a witness in here?

03:02:42.148 --> 03:02:43.428
[SPEAKER_20]: What are you talking about?

03:02:43.448 --> 03:02:45.369
[SPEAKER_20]: When's the last time Konami's fucked something up?

03:02:46.890 --> 03:02:48.230
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't get me started.

03:02:48.810 --> 03:02:49.751
[SPEAKER_19]: We won't even utter.

03:02:52.828 --> 03:02:54.608
[SPEAKER_19]: We're not going to mention that name on the radio.

03:02:57.169 --> 03:02:58.529
[SPEAKER_21]: Rice Princess, final thought.

03:02:58.570 --> 03:02:59.690
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of world is this?

03:02:59.950 --> 03:03:00.890
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of crap.

03:03:01.710 --> 03:03:01.990
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

03:03:03.211 --> 03:03:04.351
[SPEAKER_21]: Bradley, final thought.

03:03:05.231 --> 03:03:07.352
[SPEAKER_18]: Hooray for the random Oni course.

03:03:07.812 --> 03:03:09.432
[SPEAKER_18]: It's evil and fun all wrapped into one.

03:03:10.853 --> 03:03:11.493
[SPEAKER_21]: That was poetic.

03:03:13.020 --> 03:03:26.985
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sure if Jamie were here, her final thought would be squee, or we, or I own you, or something like that, or Battle Royale something, or sleep, I need sleep, or let's go get tapioca, any of the above would be Jamie's final thought, I'm pretty sure.

03:03:27.105 --> 03:03:30.466
[SPEAKER_21]: I would say with pretty good accuracy, I think I got it.

03:03:31.747 --> 03:03:35.108
[SPEAKER_21]: My final thought is, I need sex.

03:03:40.310 --> 03:03:41.370
[SPEAKER_15]: How much are you willing to pay?

03:03:43.898 --> 03:03:44.378
[SPEAKER_18]: Never mind.

03:03:44.398 --> 03:03:46.459
[SPEAKER_15]: I could be whoever you want.

03:03:49.079 --> 03:03:49.819
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you be Anita?

03:03:51.159 --> 03:03:52.860
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I could sure try.

03:03:55.220 --> 03:03:58.001
[SPEAKER_21]: I did get really drunk last night and I touched... Never mind.

03:03:58.181 --> 03:03:58.701
[SPEAKER_21]: We won't go there.

03:04:00.901 --> 03:04:02.581
[SPEAKER_06]: And it wasn't my boobie?

03:04:08.082 --> 03:04:08.662
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

03:04:10.803 --> 03:04:11.583
[SPEAKER_15]: Who'd you molest?

03:04:12.330 --> 03:04:14.633
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to get in trouble for saying that on air.

03:04:15.074 --> 03:04:16.656
[SPEAKER_21]: Final word of the night.

03:04:16.696 --> 03:04:18.859
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll give the final word of the night to the Ice Queen.

03:04:20.080 --> 03:04:21.322
[SPEAKER_21]: The haggard, wretched Ice Queen.

03:04:21.943 --> 03:04:23.285
[SPEAKER_18]: The haggard, wretched Ice Queen.

03:04:23.865 --> 03:04:24.326
[SPEAKER_18]: Final word.

03:04:24.626 --> 03:04:25.387
[SPEAKER_21]: No, one word.

03:04:25.407 --> 03:04:26.108
[SPEAKER_21]: You get one word.

03:04:26.168 --> 03:04:26.549
[SPEAKER_21]: Final word.

03:04:27.690 --> 03:04:27.971
[SPEAKER_11]: Good.
