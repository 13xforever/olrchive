WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Message for you, son!

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
Attention!

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio,

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
the Monty Talk, and then some.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

00:29.000 --> 00:33.000
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex in this episode.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Hey, are there any balls down there?

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
About the biggest berry you've ever seen, Dingleberry.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
What's your favorite security movie?

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Showgirls. Absolutely frightening.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
What's yours?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Now's the time on sprockets and we dance!

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog too!

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
I know kung fu.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Why did they have to take the word gay?

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
No!

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
What I expect for a Spanish explosion is cancer.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Hey!

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Dark Sakura.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
Shut up!

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Where's my gun?

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
This is my boomstick.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
Sky.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex with me.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
What kind of warped human being would find that funny?

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Orange Lounge Radio

01:38.000 --> 01:44.000
We are live, and this is episode number 43 for May the 4th of 2003.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
You're tuned into the Beeee Monnie scenes, most on the move radio station of all things Beeee Monnie.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.440
me as always are my awesome co-hosts. In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss

01:56.440 --> 01:58.680
Jamie Summers. You know her better as Dark Sakura?

01:58.680 --> 02:01.560
I have the corner of the couch. Can I register?

02:01.560 --> 02:04.040
Yes, we can hear you just fine. Good.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.360
In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

02:06.360 --> 02:10.280
This corner is so long, I can broadcast from inside my room. It's just crazy.

02:10.280 --> 02:15.080
You can go in the bathroom. I can go all the way into your closet, man. Seriously.

02:15.080 --> 02:17.640
Come out of the closet, Loki. Come out of the closet, please.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.040
I am broadcasting from inside the room.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.040
Eric, give me.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.040
Eric, give.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.040
Forty feet away.

02:23.040 --> 02:27.080
We'll be talking, we have a brand new set up for Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

02:27.080 --> 02:30.400
We'll be talking all about that after this break because I have to go and give Jamie

02:30.400 --> 02:33.640
her ferret or she's going to throw a fit.

02:33.640 --> 02:37.840
There are no guests in studio yet, but we're hoping that some folks are going to show up.

02:37.840 --> 02:39.880
There's a pot pie in the oven.

02:39.880 --> 02:42.400
It's kind of a new night for Orange Lounge.

02:42.400 --> 02:46.020
We're not quite yet to season three, but changes are slowly happening.

02:46.020 --> 02:48.960
So it'll be interesting for sure.

02:48.960 --> 02:55.960
be back after some of our favorite 2DX music. Enjoy!

03:48.960 --> 03:50.960
Oh

04:48.960 --> 04:53.960
Yeah, I'll fade away

04:55.960 --> 04:59.960
Last one was today, the day that you came

04:59.960 --> 05:03.960
That you came into my heart, you looked in my eyes

05:03.960 --> 05:07.960
And after you died, we'll share a feast with you

05:07.960 --> 05:11.960
And now since that day, it won't go away

05:11.960 --> 05:13.960
I'll wake up and think of you

05:13.960 --> 05:17.960
I need you to know I want you to stay

05:17.960 --> 05:20.760
Baby, please, for always

05:20.760 --> 05:26.760
Don't you know that I need you, baby, please?

05:26.760 --> 05:31.960
Don't you know that I'm begging for your love?

05:31.960 --> 05:34.760
I just wanna tell you, tell you that I love you

05:34.760 --> 05:37.960
Oh, I just can't help it, I just wanna feel it

05:37.960 --> 05:40.760
Baby, can you hear me, hear me when I'm saying

05:40.760 --> 05:43.960
Baby, please, what's going on?

05:43.960 --> 05:46.760
Baby, for a moment, baby, for forever

05:46.760 --> 05:51.760
I just wanna know you, I just wanna know you Tell me that you love me, baby, baby

05:58.760 --> 05:59.760
Ooh, yeah

06:00.760 --> 06:01.760
I'll say

08:01.760 --> 08:27.840
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

08:27.840 --> 08:33.340
Extreme Bonnie Radio, that's us Orange Lounge Radio.

08:33.340 --> 08:35.880
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

08:35.880 --> 08:39.680
And as promised, we're coming to you from our brand new

08:39.680 --> 08:42.160
studio, which is interesting.

08:42.160 --> 08:44.740
I'm hoping by next week we can have the return of the Orange

08:44.740 --> 08:46.760
Lounge webcam just so you guys can see what we're dealing

08:46.760 --> 08:47.680
with here, but.

08:47.680 --> 08:51.720
Get a nice one and mount it on the ceiling and have it span

08:51.720 --> 08:52.940
across the room.

08:52.940 --> 08:53.320
That would be pretty cool.

08:53.320 --> 08:55.120
Actually, I'm thinking we might be able to mount a webcam

08:55.120 --> 08:56.840
somewhere like up in there where you could see the whole

08:56.840 --> 08:59.040
living room in the back corner.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.040
We don't have...

09:00.040 --> 09:01.040
Right in the corner.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.360
I didn't see your pink carpet.

09:03.360 --> 09:04.360
It's rose, dammit.

09:04.360 --> 09:05.360
Pink.

09:05.360 --> 09:10.360
For those that don't really follow what's going on in our personal lives, which thank

09:10.360 --> 09:14.980
you for not stalking us, I moved out of my house.

09:14.980 --> 09:19.140
My older roommate was buying the house and was raising the rent and I'm too po.

09:19.140 --> 09:24.040
So I went to get a new place and Loki wanted a roommate, wanted to move out of where he

09:24.040 --> 09:25.040
was at too.

09:25.040 --> 09:28.800
We decided to get an apartment together, and now we are in Folsom, California, which is

09:28.800 --> 09:30.920
one of the many suburbs of Sacramento.

09:30.920 --> 09:31.920
We're in the snooty town.

09:31.920 --> 09:32.920
We're in the snooty suburb.

09:32.920 --> 09:36.760
Wait until we get to my fuck you of the week.

09:36.760 --> 09:38.760
Can't wait.

09:38.760 --> 09:42.480
So now we're in Folsom, and this is interesting, because Loki and I live together, now it's

09:42.480 --> 09:47.600
not like we really have to be considerate of anyone else during the show, because Loki

09:47.600 --> 09:51.600
and I, being two-thirds of the staff, this show pretty much runs the apartment.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.540
Well, I mean, yeah, we have to be considerate of the neighbors upstairs and the neighbors

09:54.540 --> 09:55.540
next door.

09:55.540 --> 09:56.540
As we found out the other day.

09:56.540 --> 09:57.540
I was just stretching.

09:57.540 --> 10:01.100
That was only because we were allowed after 10 p.m.

10:01.100 --> 10:05.740
Before 10 p.m. is fair game and if they ever complain about us being too loud before 10

10:05.740 --> 10:06.740
p.m.

10:06.740 --> 10:07.740
They can kiss my black ass.

10:07.740 --> 10:08.740
Seriously.

10:08.740 --> 10:09.740
What?

10:09.740 --> 10:12.980
After it gets kicked till it's that color?

10:12.980 --> 10:15.680
Now what's interesting about this new setup is I'm not even looking at the chat room right

10:15.680 --> 10:16.680
now.

10:16.680 --> 10:21.020
Our microphone cords are so long that we can just walk to and from the living room and

10:21.020 --> 10:25.820
And so we don't really have anyone monitoring the chat room yet, but I'm hoping that once

10:25.820 --> 10:29.380
Intern Zero gets here, maybe he can help us out by monitoring the chat room.

10:29.380 --> 10:31.020
Maybe he can tell I'm eating dry ramen.

10:31.020 --> 10:33.100
What an appropriate shirt, Rob.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.100
Thank you.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.900
I'm wearing my Dr. Frank-N-Furter shirt today.

10:35.900 --> 10:36.900
It's lovely.

10:36.900 --> 10:37.900
What were you saying, Loki?

10:37.900 --> 10:40.740
I said, and if anyone can tell I'm eating dry ramen.

10:40.740 --> 10:41.740
You're eating dry ramen?

10:41.740 --> 10:42.740
That's got to be nasty.

10:42.740 --> 10:43.740
I love this stuff.

10:43.740 --> 10:44.740
Let me try it.

10:44.740 --> 10:45.740
I want to try something.

10:45.740 --> 10:46.740
I'm kind of curious.

10:46.740 --> 10:48.300
You have to put the chicken seasoning on, because that's awesome.

10:48.300 --> 10:49.940
It's really salty and tastes damn good.

10:49.940 --> 10:53.660
I don't want salty, I just want to try some.

10:53.660 --> 10:55.460
Ew!

10:55.460 --> 10:58.500
It's weird.

10:58.500 --> 11:00.020
You are a strange kid, Loki.

11:00.020 --> 11:01.700
Oh, not bad.

11:01.700 --> 11:04.140
So we did get a special guest joining us during that break.

11:04.140 --> 11:06.020
Say hello, special guest.

11:06.020 --> 11:09.100
Hello, special guest.

11:09.100 --> 11:11.060
Smartass.

11:11.060 --> 11:12.140
How you doing, Bradley?

11:12.140 --> 11:14.420
I'm doing OK today.

11:14.420 --> 11:16.500
A big thank you, by the way, for helping Loki and I

11:16.500 --> 11:17.840
move into this place.

11:17.840 --> 11:18.380
No problem.

11:18.380 --> 11:20.380
What was the nastiest thing you had to move?

11:20.380 --> 11:22.380
For one of us?

11:24.380 --> 11:26.380
I don't know.

11:26.380 --> 11:28.380
Maybe some old boxes.

11:28.380 --> 11:30.380
Old boxes.

11:30.380 --> 11:32.380
Evil Pikachu.

11:32.380 --> 11:34.380
Yeah, my Pikachu. That was the scariest thing.

11:34.380 --> 11:36.380
Bradley had to move.

11:36.380 --> 11:38.380
What's interesting now is that we have a kitchen.

11:38.380 --> 11:41.380
Because the way our apartment is,

11:41.380 --> 11:44.380
the kitchen is literally right next to

11:44.380 --> 11:47.380
the workstations and our living room.

11:47.380 --> 11:51.600
living room, I can't wait till we get the webcams so we can show all you guys this,

11:51.600 --> 11:55.340
but you might hear Jamie kind of running back and forth to the kitchen, hurry up and cook,

11:55.340 --> 11:57.540
pop by, and things like that, so.

11:57.540 --> 12:02.820
And I can watch Simpsons while doing the show. The best, best ever.

12:02.820 --> 12:06.500
But you'd be too easily distracted, Mr. Loki.

12:06.500 --> 12:07.500
So?

12:07.500 --> 12:12.140
Oh, yeah. That'll ruin any show.

12:12.140 --> 12:14.640
But what is interesting is that now we're sitting here in the living room, we can fire

12:14.640 --> 12:18.340
up the Playstation and play whatever games are new. For instance, if we wanted to, we

12:18.340 --> 12:19.340
could fire up Max 2.

12:19.340 --> 12:21.020
Yeah, if I didn't already outplay it.

12:21.020 --> 12:23.540
If you didn't already outplay it. Jamie, have you seen Max 2 yet?

12:23.540 --> 12:24.540
Who cares?

12:24.540 --> 12:25.540
Who cares?

12:25.540 --> 12:28.460
Yeah, I have it too, so I've played it. I'll do it.

12:28.460 --> 12:35.540
Do you have your mic over there, Jamie? Jamie doesn't care she doesn't have her mic.

12:35.540 --> 12:36.540
Okay.

12:36.540 --> 12:37.540
Yes, I bought Max 2 also, so.

12:37.540 --> 12:38.540
What did you think of Max 2?

12:38.540 --> 12:43.420
That's pretty good. There's lots of songs, and...

12:43.420 --> 12:47.420
I need to get Kingdom Hearts Final Mix before I get Max 2.

13:13.420 --> 13:14.420
No, I didn't.

13:14.420 --> 13:17.420
All you do, you go into Create Your Own Oni course, right?

13:17.420 --> 13:18.420
Yeah.

13:18.420 --> 13:20.420
And you set all your songs to roulette.

13:20.420 --> 13:24.420
And then the steps, because you can set the level of steps you'll get to roulette.

13:24.420 --> 13:25.420
Oh, yeah.

13:25.420 --> 13:28.420
Basic, uh, middle, er, basic trick maniac, light, standard, heavy.

13:28.420 --> 13:29.420
Yeah, yeah.

13:29.420 --> 13:30.420
Whatever it is.

13:30.420 --> 13:31.420
And challenge, yeah.

13:31.420 --> 13:32.420
I hate how they change names.

13:32.420 --> 13:34.420
They will forever be trick and maniac to me, dammit.

13:34.420 --> 13:37.420
You set them all to challenge, and then that way you'll only get the challenge songs.

13:37.420 --> 13:38.420
And then you-

13:38.420 --> 13:41.420
But yeah, they're forever gonna be, you know, SSR and-

13:41.420 --> 13:42.420
Whatever.

13:42.420 --> 13:56.420
You can put all your songs on 1.5 speed solo light challenge mode and you'll have all your challenge songs in like under an hour.

13:56.420 --> 13:57.420
So it's easy.

13:57.420 --> 13:58.420
Oh yeah.

13:58.420 --> 13:59.420
That was the only way.

13:59.420 --> 14:00.420
I did the hard way.

14:00.420 --> 14:01.420
You did the hard way. Did you get them all?

14:01.420 --> 14:02.420
Yeah.

14:02.420 --> 14:03.420
Dang.

14:03.420 --> 14:05.420
They're the hardest ones to get in the afternoon.

14:05.420 --> 14:07.420
Drop out, right?

14:07.420 --> 14:09.420
I thought it was easy because...

14:09.420 --> 14:13.420
What's your haka? I mean, you just want to go too.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.420
Oh, because it's the first stage.

14:15.420 --> 14:16.420
Yeah.

14:16.420 --> 14:20.420
And, also, you can get, I got, you can get some of them if you're using the random course.

14:20.420 --> 14:22.420
Oh, okay. Well, that's kind of the same idea.

14:22.420 --> 14:24.420
Random course is evil.

14:24.420 --> 14:25.420
Random course is evil.

14:25.420 --> 14:27.420
My favorite course.

14:27.420 --> 14:28.420
Play all of them.

14:28.420 --> 14:35.420
It's an interesting feature to add to DDR, though, where you can, it, basically the random only course now selects any song at random, any difficulty.

14:35.420 --> 14:38.420
Well, pretty much only Trick and, Trick and Maniac are the only ones that can.

14:38.420 --> 14:40.820
I don't know, what did you get that one too? You got, uh, what was it?

14:40.820 --> 14:43.820
Burning Heat Heavy 8-Speed Boost.

14:43.820 --> 14:47.820
I got Burning Heat Heavy 8-Speed Boost. I was so pissed.

14:47.820 --> 14:51.820
I got more like 5-speed than... I mean, I put 5-speed at 30.

14:51.820 --> 14:59.220
And then, of course, we have beaten the course, or I should say Brad did, because Brad was over here,

14:59.220 --> 15:02.820
and he played the course, and he was getting four... wait, how many songs do you have to play?

15:02.820 --> 15:03.820
Five or six? I forget.

15:03.820 --> 15:04.820
I think six.

15:04.820 --> 15:10.880
Four of them were standard songs and the hardest modifier he got was Sudden on one of the standard

15:10.880 --> 15:11.880
songs.

15:11.880 --> 15:13.200
He got a Sudden on one of the standard songs.

15:13.200 --> 15:19.000
And the rest was like, ooh, I might have to play two-speed or something, it was sick.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
He makes me mad.

15:20.000 --> 15:30.000
It's funny, like, I had five pretty regular ones, and then the last one was the AM3P Rubix.

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
It was, like, 3x hidden, worse, less flat.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
It worked really well.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
How are you doing, Bradley?

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
I'll fix it.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Can you hear me?

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Yeah, we can hear everybody, so.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
Hello, anyone out there?

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
That was weird.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
All right, whatever.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Anyway, where were we?

16:17.000 --> 16:26.400
Oh, we were talking about Max 2 for Japanese system.

16:26.400 --> 16:31.960
I think, I actually, what I like most about Max 2 is like, I like those Oni course songs.

16:31.960 --> 16:36.200
Like, they're, it's kind of neat to be able to play them at home whenever you want, because

16:36.200 --> 16:38.840
I was playing a lot of those on Extreme.

16:38.840 --> 16:43.840
and now I can play them at home. But what sucks is that they didn't add any new steps to them.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.840
It's just the challenge steps.

16:45.840 --> 16:48.840
Those are lazy as fuck. Did you notice the new songs that are all challenge steps, too?

16:48.840 --> 16:50.840
I bet they're just going to stay like that.

16:50.840 --> 16:52.840
And you know what's even worse is because

16:52.840 --> 16:57.840
B4U before is a beat mix, and Hysteria 2001 have steps already done.

16:57.840 --> 17:00.840
That's how lazy they are. They didn't even put them in there because they're already done.

17:00.840 --> 17:01.840
For Euromix, right?

17:01.840 --> 17:04.840
For Euromix, too. And it's just like...

17:04.840 --> 17:09.400
notice all their versions that they get, they get more licensed songs. They've gotten licensed

17:09.400 --> 17:15.280
songs from the get-go. We've gotten fucked every single time. Except for Max USA and

17:15.280 --> 17:18.600
they're like, oh, here you go, licensed songs. Well, gee, it's about time. You're only like,

17:18.600 --> 17:23.120
you know, two mixes behind. What's going to be interesting, though, is the news, and that'll

17:23.120 --> 17:29.000
be a big show when we hear when B3's over, what comes out of that. Yes, that is a microphone,

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
You like that one, don't you?

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
It's a condenser mic.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
I just need a mic stand.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
That's going to be the one that's going to record background noise.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Oh, goody.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Hmm.

17:44.000 --> 17:49.000
Jamie's getting all angsty over her pot pie.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Loki, what are you doing?

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
I'm seeing this on TV.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
You're going to turn on the TV during the show?

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Hell yeah.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.960
You need to get a VCR so we don't get so easily distracted

18:00.520 --> 18:02.520
You're watching the weakest link

18:04.320 --> 18:07.000
Did you guys forget we do a radio show Sunday nights

18:10.920 --> 18:15.260
I'm just I'm turning the channel. I want to go back to why are we watching the game show network?

18:15.260 --> 18:19.000
I was watching the game show network. I was watching $100,000 pyramid that shows. Oh my god

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
I saw the coolest game what who wants to beat up a millionaire?

18:22.000 --> 18:29.420
What is that like on dreamcast? I've said that's hella old. That was like a old old dream. Yeah, but I didn't pay attention to the crap games

18:30.160 --> 18:32.880
Did you buy it? No Ross is playing it

18:33.800 --> 18:38.120
How does it work? You get your question right you get to beat up the millionaire for money

18:41.340 --> 18:45.160
Loki's trying to figure out how to use digital cable right now. We're stuck on the weakest link, right?

18:46.360 --> 18:49.300
No, we're getting TiVo when I'm not ghetto poor anymore, Jamie

18:49.300 --> 18:56.300
I know how to do this.

18:56.300 --> 18:58.300
Shut up.

18:58.300 --> 19:03.300
Well, so this is an interesting perspective here.

19:03.300 --> 19:04.300
How so?

19:04.300 --> 19:06.300
I'm in front of the computer this time.

19:06.300 --> 19:08.300
I think this is the A team.

19:08.300 --> 19:09.300
Whoa, the A team is cool.

19:09.300 --> 19:10.300
No, it's thunderball.

19:10.300 --> 19:11.300
Uncut.

19:11.300 --> 19:12.300
Oh.

19:12.300 --> 19:15.300
Can you turn it down so we're not muted until your show's on or whatever?

19:15.300 --> 19:16.300
I don't want to watch this anyways.

19:16.300 --> 19:19.060
I thought that most extreme elimination challenge is gonna be on fuck this

19:20.900 --> 19:23.900
Do you want to put in max to we can play a little max to on air

19:24.740 --> 19:30.980
Show off our new our see that's really gonna do good for the listeners because they can just hear the music in here

19:30.980 --> 19:32.980
Oh, you're doing shitty

19:34.060 --> 19:40.940
Whoa another triple well you try practicing in a closet. I just kick-ass another triple-a again. Oh my god

19:40.940 --> 19:44.940
I'm gonna do this blindfold. Oh, look, another AAA. Come on.

19:44.940 --> 19:49.940
What the fuck is this? Ghost in a Shell movie CD?

19:49.940 --> 19:52.940
Ooh, that's Ultra Ghetto.

19:52.940 --> 20:01.940
Remember, like, before CDs when they used to sell, like, movie CDs at CompUSA where you could, like, it was on, like, two CDs and it was just basically one giant AVI file or something?

20:01.940 --> 20:03.940
You mean it's a VCD?

20:03.940 --> 20:08.940
Huh? It's pretty much a VCD, yeah, but you watch it on your PC. It's like Ultra Ghetto.

20:08.940 --> 20:12.940
Ghetto crap. It says that's not even a good movie.

20:12.940 --> 20:16.940
But you could buy like seven.

20:16.940 --> 20:20.940
Yeah, I know. Dang, Loki. Enough movies? Unpacked?

20:20.940 --> 20:24.940
Hey, there's Final Fuck X.

20:24.940 --> 20:28.940
I burned that for you.

20:28.940 --> 20:32.940
All the porn's behind me? Should we look through some of Loki's interesting porn?

20:32.940 --> 20:36.940
Hey, let's watch porn!

20:36.940 --> 20:42.940
Let's go back to the Orange Lounge Radio roots and watch some porn.

20:42.940 --> 20:45.940
Dude, it's comedy.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.940
This is great. I'm loving this new facility.

20:47.940 --> 20:51.940
Now we don't just have to talk about porn, we can watch porn.

20:59.940 --> 21:01.940
Jekyll and Hyde.

21:01.940 --> 21:04.940
Let's take a chat room.

21:04.940 --> 21:10.940
can you monitor the chat room, Jamie, and see which one of these they want to watch?

21:10.940 --> 21:13.940
Okay, I'm just going to go by based on biggest response.

21:13.940 --> 21:14.940
Hand me that big stack.

21:14.940 --> 21:15.940
Okay, let me...

21:15.940 --> 21:19.940
Lucky, hand me your big stack.

21:19.940 --> 21:22.940
Stack Overflow.

21:22.940 --> 21:25.940
We have The Watcher 3.

21:25.940 --> 21:28.940
Oh, it's Mirage's first anal.

21:28.940 --> 21:32.940
Let's see, we have DNA Hunter Volume 1, totally uncensored.

21:32.940 --> 21:37.220
This is animated, but it's voiced by adult stars.

21:37.220 --> 21:39.900
Now chat room, since there's a little lag, you're going to have to type the name of the

21:39.900 --> 21:41.660
porno that you want to see.

21:41.660 --> 21:42.860
Really loud, so Jamie sees.

21:42.860 --> 21:43.860
This one's lame?

21:43.860 --> 21:46.460
Oh, it's Jenna Jameson and Cruz and Jennaville.

21:46.460 --> 21:47.460
It kind of looks lame.

21:47.460 --> 21:50.620
It's one of those stupid softcore, like, I'm getting naked and touching myself things.

21:50.620 --> 21:52.320
Really retarded.

21:52.320 --> 21:53.820
You don't have any gay porn, huh?

21:53.820 --> 21:54.820
I used to.

21:54.820 --> 21:56.940
Hey, I had that one you gave me in my trunk.

21:56.940 --> 21:58.660
Oh, that's right.

21:58.660 --> 22:00.740
There's a gay porn out, yeah, in the trunk.

22:00.740 --> 22:04.740
Okay, so we have a random gay porn we can watch, too.

22:04.740 --> 22:08.740
Let's see, what's this? Karen, totally uncensored.

22:08.740 --> 22:12.740
By the way, you think this show's gone to the toilet? Well, we don't care what you think.

22:12.740 --> 22:16.740
Jekyll and Hyde with multiple angles.

22:16.740 --> 22:17.740
Ooh!

22:17.740 --> 22:18.740
Multiple angles.

22:18.740 --> 22:21.740
Let's see. Real wild girls out of control.

22:21.740 --> 22:23.740
Gravitation is not porn.

22:23.740 --> 22:28.740
That's the ultra ghetto version of girls gone wild. It's just horrible.

22:28.740 --> 22:29.740
That's actually pretty good.

22:29.740 --> 22:32.860
I don't think there's anything in there, is there?

22:32.860 --> 22:33.860
It's a playboy disc.

22:33.860 --> 22:35.980
No, there isn't anything in there, huh?

22:35.980 --> 22:37.980
La, la, la, la, la, la.

22:37.980 --> 22:40.740
Instead of Sailor Moon, it's Sailor and the Seven Balls.

22:40.740 --> 22:42.620
Awful, awful, awful animation.

22:42.620 --> 22:43.620
I'm curious.

22:43.620 --> 22:45.180
That's the worst animation I've ever seen.

22:45.180 --> 22:47.180
Let me see that.

22:47.180 --> 22:52.060
Let me borrow that, because I want to see how bad it is.

22:52.060 --> 22:54.060
Sex and the Stranger.

22:54.060 --> 22:58.740
Also, some of them have 2D videos.

22:58.740 --> 23:00.740
Nevermind, this looks really stupid.

23:00.740 --> 23:01.740
Couples.

23:01.740 --> 23:03.740
This looks more than stupid.

23:03.740 --> 23:04.740
Oh, Treasure Hunt.

23:04.740 --> 23:06.740
This looks like it was done in Flash.

23:06.740 --> 23:07.740
That was done in Flash.

23:07.740 --> 23:10.740
It's an erotic paradise and ten million dollars.

23:10.740 --> 23:12.740
Only one catch, you gotta live to collect.

23:12.740 --> 23:15.740
So it's like porn, and they beat each other up.

23:15.740 --> 23:16.740
No one wants to see that.

23:16.740 --> 23:17.740
No one wants to see this either.

23:17.740 --> 23:18.740
It's softball crap.

23:18.740 --> 23:19.740
I just kinda put them all.

23:19.740 --> 23:20.740
Okay.

23:20.740 --> 23:22.740
The rest is, oh, no, it's softball too.

23:22.740 --> 23:23.740
Okay.

23:23.740 --> 23:24.740
The rest is good.

23:24.740 --> 23:25.740
Alright.

23:25.740 --> 23:32.740
a heat for all seasons

23:32.740 --> 23:37.740
uh... nubian nurse orgy

23:37.740 --> 23:39.140
nubian

23:39.140 --> 23:40.780
oh i think that wins

23:40.780 --> 23:44.380
okay so we have a nubian nurse orgy in the lead

23:44.380 --> 23:46.100
hurry up cause i'm bored

23:46.100 --> 23:51.140
uh... interactive mindteaser that sounds stupid

23:51.140 --> 23:55.740
ooh and then seven deadly sins

23:55.740 --> 24:02.340
okay we're gonna watch nubian nurse orgy i don't care with the chatroom face

24:02.340 --> 24:03.760
well then they lose

24:03.760 --> 24:07.460
uh... but we don't have a dvd player hooked up do we

24:07.460 --> 24:08.300
okay we'll have to

24:08.300 --> 24:11.540
get that okay that'll be something we can look forward to after the break then

24:11.540 --> 24:18.540
is uh... nubian nurse orgy

24:26.060 --> 24:29.060
actually we have a we have a stand-alone dvd player somewhere at least i have one

24:29.060 --> 24:30.960
the other day

24:30.960 --> 24:32.980
did you find it

24:32.980 --> 24:34.620
good we have a dvd player

24:34.620 --> 24:35.520
so we have that

24:35.520 --> 24:39.520
We have that to look for. Yes, the carpeting in here is pink, isn't it lovely?

24:45.520 --> 24:50.520
So, Jamie, you bought yourself a book the other day.

24:50.520 --> 24:51.520
Yes, I did.

24:51.520 --> 24:52.520
What did you buy?

24:52.520 --> 24:53.520
Battle Royale.

24:53.520 --> 24:55.520
It's about time. How is it?

24:55.520 --> 24:59.520
I bought it two days ago.

24:59.520 --> 25:02.520
And this is just reading it in the bathroom.

25:02.520 --> 25:04.520
So you're about a quarter of the way about?

25:04.520 --> 25:08.520
How many kids are still alive?

25:08.520 --> 25:11.520
Hold on.

25:11.520 --> 25:13.520
Yeah, the chapters end with a body count.

25:13.520 --> 25:15.520
30 students remain.

25:15.520 --> 25:18.520
So, a quarter of them are down, basically.

25:18.520 --> 25:19.520
Nice.

25:19.520 --> 25:46.640
She got to have the cookies.

25:46.640 --> 25:48.640
Is there anything else going on in the Bimani world?

25:48.640 --> 25:50.640
Loki, what's new in Simland?

25:50.640 --> 25:52.640
Is there anything new in Simland?

25:52.640 --> 25:54.640
Why don't we hook up the DVD player first?

25:54.640 --> 25:56.640
Jeez, Rob.

25:56.640 --> 25:57.640
Jeez.

25:57.640 --> 25:58.640
Crack that whip!

25:58.640 --> 26:02.640
Sorry, I forgot for a minute that we're not a Bimani show.

26:02.640 --> 26:05.640
I have something new in the Bimani world.

26:05.640 --> 26:06.640
What?

26:06.640 --> 26:08.640
I haven't played any Bimani this week.

26:08.640 --> 26:10.640
Congratulations.

26:10.640 --> 26:11.640
No, I played 2DX.

26:11.640 --> 26:12.640
Did you?

26:12.640 --> 26:14.640
You saw me beat Last Message twice in a row.

26:14.640 --> 26:15.640
I have the stars now.

26:15.640 --> 26:16.640
Did you beat another one, too?

26:16.640 --> 26:17.640
No.

26:17.640 --> 26:18.640
You beat Please Don't Go.

26:18.640 --> 26:19.640
I beat Please Don't Go.

26:19.640 --> 26:20.640
That was my first one.

26:20.640 --> 26:21.640
My second one was Monkey Dance.

26:21.640 --> 26:22.640
Oh, okay.

26:22.640 --> 26:26.120
And I've beaten Nine O' Clocks, but it was on Easy, and I border-bonused, so it doesn't

26:26.120 --> 26:27.120
count.

26:27.120 --> 26:28.120
Doesn't count.

26:28.120 --> 26:31.120
So, I've sort of...

26:31.120 --> 26:32.120
I haven't...

26:32.120 --> 26:33.120
You know, it's weird.

26:33.120 --> 26:35.280
It's hard to get back into the swing of things right now, because I honestly feel like we

26:35.280 --> 26:36.820
haven't done a show in a month.

26:36.820 --> 26:40.760
And then to come back and do a show here, like at a brand new place, it's weird.

26:40.760 --> 26:41.760
It doesn't even...

26:41.760 --> 26:42.760
It doesn't feel...

26:42.760 --> 26:44.240
Yeah, it doesn't feel serious right now.

26:44.240 --> 26:55.160
it's going to take us until our season three premiere until we feel serious. Yes, that's

26:55.160 --> 27:09.500
right, we know. I remember that. You know, I remember I used to have those little like

27:09.500 --> 27:13.000
Sesame Street books and I would get the little records and you could play on the record player

27:13.000 --> 27:16.560
and it would go, and now turn the page, bling, and it made a little chime and you could turn

27:16.560 --> 27:17.560
the page.

27:17.560 --> 27:18.560
Yes.

27:18.560 --> 27:32.040
I had Garfield ones, those were cool.

27:32.040 --> 27:39.960
We might want to pull the blinds because that's the last thing we need are more complaints.

27:39.960 --> 27:46.960
Porn is funny.

27:46.960 --> 27:52.960
Porn is comedy.

27:52.960 --> 27:59.960
Wait, are we going to take a break and then do porn?

27:59.960 --> 28:04.960
The mics are on.

28:04.960 --> 28:06.960
audio going out.

28:06.960 --> 28:16.720
Yeah, we freaking have them on.

28:16.720 --> 28:20.120
They keep cutting out or something?

28:20.120 --> 28:28.140
Bring up the studio broadcaster and then when you just keep an eye on that and make sure

28:28.140 --> 28:30.000
we don't drop.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.040
I think this one is unconnected at the bottom.

28:33.040 --> 28:34.040
It's unconnecting.

28:34.040 --> 28:41.600
Yeah. Oh. That's what? I'll explain why our volume keeps jumping. Okay, just one sec.

28:41.600 --> 29:01.000
No one talk. Dead air. Sorry about that. Hello. Okay, we're good. That's...

29:01.000 --> 29:18.440
Oh, maybe not? Boy, this is the greatest episode of Orange Lounge Radio ever. Okay, well I

29:18.440 --> 29:27.760
I still see that, um, we're getting, uh, I have to check on your pot pie? Fine. Your

29:27.760 --> 29:42.040
pot pie has... Maybe we should go to music. Fifteen minutes for your pot pie. Yeah, let's

29:42.040 --> 29:49.040
Let's go to music right now. Now's a good time to break.

29:52.180 --> 29:57.180
Okay, what? What do you want me to say?

29:57.180 --> 30:00.500
Hi.

30:00.500 --> 30:05.460
Hello, hello. You gotta go to C, C colon

30:05.460 --> 30:07.540
and then orange lounge.

30:07.540 --> 30:17.360
B3? Oh yeah, B3's coming up. That'll be fun. That's in two weeks. Okay, we have this weekend

30:17.360 --> 30:22.080
is episode 43. Next weekend's episode 44. Then we have the week after that, the 17th

30:22.080 --> 30:26.880
and the 18th, we have B3, which is this huge tournament that's happening at the Riptide

30:26.880 --> 30:30.940
Arcade in San Francisco, which I went to for the first time this week, by the way. It's

30:30.940 --> 30:35.200
pretty nifty. If I remember right, a lot of the flooring is wood, so it feels like you're

30:35.200 --> 30:37.080
you're playing video games on a pier

30:37.080 --> 30:38.800
so it's interesting

30:38.800 --> 30:42.800
well because you are, because you're on the pier and playing an arcade but

30:42.800 --> 30:47.960
yeah about four songs

30:47.960 --> 30:53.400
uh... so we have B3, we're going to be broadcasting live from B3 all day long

30:53.400 --> 30:54.960
saturday and sunday

30:54.960 --> 30:58.800
and uh... if you think this is interesting radio, wait till you hear that

30:58.800 --> 31:02.120
hopefully you guys are listening during our March Madness broadcast or if you remember

31:02.120 --> 31:07.180
way back to the Shaft broadcast. We'll talk more about B3 and all that after the break

31:07.180 --> 31:14.180
can we get some more mics hooked up. So we'll be back.

33:37.180 --> 33:39.180
You gon' say say, cut the drugs, ha!

34:37.180 --> 34:39.180
You

35:37.180 --> 35:39.180
Party time!

36:07.180 --> 36:08.180
All the time

36:38.180 --> 37:04.180
PARDON CHOP!

37:04.180 --> 37:27.140
I felt the urge to do that brand dance.

37:27.140 --> 37:28.140
The brand dance?

37:28.140 --> 37:29.140
Yeah.

37:29.140 --> 37:30.140
During night motion?

37:30.140 --> 37:31.140
Yeah.

37:31.140 --> 37:32.140
Cool.

37:32.140 --> 37:35.140
Many people probably don't get that.

37:35.140 --> 37:37.140
Can you tell the story then?

37:37.140 --> 37:38.140
I wasn't there, I don't know.

37:38.140 --> 37:40.140
Oh.

37:40.140 --> 37:47.140
I remember, though, at AX 2001, I think it was, there was a tournament.

37:47.140 --> 37:48.140
See, I wasn't there for the tournament either.

37:48.140 --> 37:50.140
I just decided not to do it.

37:50.140 --> 37:55.140
But everyone for Freestyle, for the post qualifiers, got up there and did Night in Motion.

37:55.140 --> 37:57.140
Everybody did.

37:57.140 --> 38:00.140
Got up there and did Night in Motion.

38:00.140 --> 38:04.140
Anyway, my pot pie is taunting me.

38:06.140 --> 38:08.140
Rob's tweaking with a thingy.

38:09.140 --> 38:10.140
He's pinching it.

38:10.140 --> 38:11.140
Trying to make one of the mics a little louder.

38:11.140 --> 38:12.140
He's trying to make it get decided.

38:14.140 --> 38:16.140
I don't need to be loud!

38:21.140 --> 38:23.140
Rob needs to have his volume checked.

38:23.140 --> 38:24.140
Yeah, you need to turn mine down.

38:25.140 --> 38:27.140
I have a voice that carries.

38:27.140 --> 38:33.820
So, hey, Loki reminded me during the break of a Bomani topic.

38:33.820 --> 38:37.300
You remember how DDR is coming out for the Xbox?

38:37.300 --> 38:38.300
You mean that bullshit?

38:38.300 --> 38:42.940
Yeah, well, they have the first screenshot out now, and it looks like Drop the Bomb is

38:42.940 --> 38:43.940
gonna be in it.

38:43.940 --> 38:46.260
I still think that's bullshit.

38:46.260 --> 38:47.340
How's it bullshit?

38:47.340 --> 38:50.100
I still think that it's a big bullshit hoax.

38:50.100 --> 38:55.500
You think DDR on X- What are you doing, Loki?

38:55.500 --> 38:56.900
I was getting on my internet.

38:56.900 --> 39:01.900
Oh. I forgot that the, a sound from mine's, um, sorry.

39:01.900 --> 39:06.900
Because you're using NAS 0. Well that's, you know why?

39:06.900 --> 39:11.900
Because a certain somebody who's on the internet looking up address directions had their

39:11.900 --> 39:16.900
cable hooked up to that one and not mine so I couldn't hook it up because we don't know how to use the router and suck.

39:19.900 --> 39:24.900
Okay, I can set up your router. Well not now because we're doing a show.

39:24.900 --> 39:30.900
You think DDR on Xbox is still a big hoax?

39:30.900 --> 39:34.900
There was an official press release on it, okay?

39:34.900 --> 39:36.900
I didn't say it was a hoax, I said it's crap.

39:36.900 --> 39:37.900
Oh, it's crap.

39:37.900 --> 39:40.900
That I concur.

39:40.900 --> 39:42.900
And I'm probably going to have it.

39:42.900 --> 39:45.900
Because we get all this stuff that they put out for Xbox because they sent it to us for free.

39:45.900 --> 39:46.900
That's cool.

39:46.900 --> 39:50.900
Well, I'm not buying an Xbox 4. They think that I'm doing that.

39:50.900 --> 39:54.900
The only way I'd ever buy an Xbox is if they came out with Mario Kart for the Xbox.

39:54.900 --> 39:58.900
But since that'll never ever happen, I don't need an Xbox.

39:58.900 --> 40:01.900
However, Mario Kart Double Dash? Oh yeah.

40:01.900 --> 40:05.900
But they don't have Mario Kart on the PS2, and you have one of those.

40:05.900 --> 40:09.900
Yeah, but that's because I needed Final Fantasy VIII.

40:09.900 --> 40:11.900
Final Fantasy VIII was PS1, not PS2.

40:11.900 --> 40:13.900
Okay, that's because I needed Final Fantasy X.

40:13.900 --> 40:14.900
PC-10.

40:14.900 --> 40:18.100
What did I buy on PS2-4?

40:18.100 --> 40:19.100
I bought...

40:19.100 --> 40:21.340
Armored Core 2 was my first game, I think.

40:21.340 --> 40:23.840
I just wanted one because it was cool.

40:23.840 --> 40:28.920
Because all the cool kids on the block had a PS2.

40:28.920 --> 40:33.640
I bought a PS1 beforehand when Final Fantasy VII came out.

40:33.640 --> 40:36.240
That was the reason why I bought that one.

40:36.240 --> 40:37.820
Oh, so worth it, too.

40:37.820 --> 40:42.920
I haven't heard the buzzer go off.

40:42.920 --> 40:45.600
What else is new in Bomani World right now, and there's other stuff going on.

40:45.600 --> 40:48.480
There's still 2DX Night Style news that slowly trickles in.

40:48.480 --> 40:52.920
It looks like all the songs that are coming back into 2DX are up.

40:52.920 --> 40:56.240
I remember you posted something in your LiveJournal about it, right Bradley?

40:56.240 --> 40:57.240
Was that you?

40:57.240 --> 40:58.240
Yeah.

40:58.240 --> 41:00.240
Oh, you want to talk about this here?

41:00.240 --> 41:04.240
Well, I saw a link on DDR Break and I posted that.

41:04.240 --> 41:08.800
They say they had some new, had a longer list

41:08.800 --> 41:12.580
of returning songs and which included some

41:12.580 --> 41:17.120
of the new ones are Jivin' to the Night, let's see what else,

41:17.120 --> 41:26.620
Empathy, North also, what else, Cleone, yeah, okay, and there's

41:26.620 --> 41:29.980
like one or two others that were new

41:29.980 --> 41:33.000
that they hadn't renounced before about returning

41:33.000 --> 41:38.180
and there was both pictures of that and actually look at those. So, it's really nice.

41:38.180 --> 41:45.860
I have, what was it, sim file or sim worldwide. All right, give us sim updates. Well, biggest

41:45.860 --> 41:52.180
update ever is going to be TurniMix 4 has been announced and that's, well, I would get

41:52.180 --> 41:56.300
on the internet and check what the date was. I think it was on the June 19th or something

41:56.300 --> 42:01.580
like that. My memory serves me right. So, that's coming up. They pretty much outlawed

42:01.580 --> 42:08.820
any DDR songs. It's pretty much only pop music and guitar freaks, I think, are fair

42:08.820 --> 42:14.220
game, if I remember correctly, and then anything else you want to do. Just know, I think they

42:14.220 --> 42:19.460
were sick of people doing stupid remixes of Max 300 and...

42:19.460 --> 42:21.940
Amen. Thank you, whoever made that decision.

42:21.940 --> 42:26.020
Yeah, because stupid people out there think that they can remix...

42:26.020 --> 42:28.900
Wait a minute, though. That means you can't enter Legend of Trance, huh? Because that's

42:28.900 --> 42:29.900
decent.

42:29.900 --> 42:30.900
No, I can't.

42:30.900 --> 42:34.900
But you know what? I'll just make something else. Or I'll just get something else to come.

42:34.900 --> 42:37.900
Excuse me, you've got another mix.

42:37.900 --> 42:40.900
Yeah, but there's no BeatMania either.

42:40.900 --> 42:41.900
Damn.

42:41.900 --> 42:42.900
Or remixes.

42:42.900 --> 42:44.900
What's a bunch of bitches?

42:44.900 --> 42:48.900
But wasn't it on, um, it wasn't in the Takoni, was it?

42:48.900 --> 42:49.900
Damn.

42:49.900 --> 42:50.900
Make another one.

42:50.900 --> 42:54.900
I'll make another one. I've got crap I was working on.

42:54.900 --> 42:59.900
I have stuff that I'm working on right now, but it doesn't sound that good, I think.

42:59.900 --> 43:08.220
I don't know see there was I can pull it up right now there was if anyone wants

43:08.220 --> 43:11.860
to hear like a preview of this one I guess I can play it oh you're gonna play

43:11.860 --> 43:15.900
us a preview oh yeah I don't know I might scrap this whole thing because it

43:15.900 --> 43:18.880
just I don't know if I can work with this remix yeah play the preview play

43:18.880 --> 43:24.380
the preview okay here we go this is a I haven't even titled it yet it's just a

43:24.380 --> 43:29.380
a remix of the sound of Goodbye, so here we go.

I'm John

44:01.380 --> 44:02.380
I'm John

44:32.380 --> 44:57.380
And that's all I have, really, right now.

44:57.380 --> 44:58.700
You know what, though?

44:58.700 --> 45:02.340
Because you're not gonna even be able to use that one, either, because that's a 2DX song.

45:02.340 --> 45:06.340
What else did I have? I had some other shit in here.

45:06.340 --> 45:09.340
Anyways, so that's going on.

45:09.340 --> 45:11.340
Let's see, other than that...

45:11.340 --> 45:14.340
Remix of Jet World.

45:14.340 --> 45:17.340
Yeah, do a transfer music with a Tar Freak song.

45:17.340 --> 45:19.340
I can't because there's not a...

45:19.340 --> 45:22.340
The problem is, is a lot of songs, especially the stuff I've been picking now,

45:22.340 --> 45:25.340
has either full length version stuff for it,

45:25.340 --> 45:27.340
or like, because you need to like, be able to like,

45:27.340 --> 45:29.340
catch the different instruments in there.

45:29.340 --> 45:32.840
the different instruments in there so cuz I don't have like an 8 track of it

45:32.840 --> 45:38.220
where it has everything separated you know so I have to take long long long

45:38.220 --> 45:43.360
versions of it so that I can cut different sections out of it and use it

45:43.360 --> 45:47.320
but I don't know I'm probably in like I said before I'm going to probably cut

45:47.320 --> 45:55.840
that one what's this one oh this one I don't think sounded that good I think I

45:55.840 --> 45:58.840
I scraped this one. This is like...

45:58.840 --> 46:02.840
Yeah, that's awful. Okay.

46:02.840 --> 46:03.840
I don't...

46:03.840 --> 46:05.840
I don't know.

46:05.840 --> 46:07.840
Camelion did techno.

46:07.840 --> 46:09.840
Camelion did techno? I want to hear that.

46:09.840 --> 46:12.840
I don't even think there's anything... No, I didn't even do anything on this.

46:12.840 --> 46:14.840
I just like... It was an idea.

46:14.840 --> 46:15.840
I still might do something.

46:15.840 --> 46:18.840
You need to finish that one. Camelion did techno. I want to hear that.

46:18.840 --> 46:22.840
There was other news that's sort of Bomani-related that came out this week.

46:22.840 --> 46:24.840
What's that?

46:24.840 --> 46:34.840
Nukutomo. Oh, God. All right, play one of those. Here we go.

46:34.840 --> 46:36.840
Who are you?!

46:47.840 --> 46:49.840
Hey, I'm thinking of you

46:50.340 --> 46:54.840
I must afford to wait to walk away

46:54.840 --> 46:56.840
Yes, in my life today

46:56.840 --> 47:00.840
They make my walls the color of blue

47:26.840 --> 47:28.840
Get with, with

47:29.840 --> 47:30.840
For it has

47:30.840 --> 47:32.840
Fire, yeah

47:32.840 --> 47:33.840
The green has

47:33.840 --> 47:35.840
The morning

47:35.840 --> 47:37.840
Yellow, metal

47:37.840 --> 47:39.840
Hello, hello

47:39.840 --> 47:42.840
Give me a smile

47:43.840 --> 47:45.840
I am covered

47:45.840 --> 47:48.840
In scarlet wood with wool

47:48.840 --> 47:50.840
For it won't

47:50.840 --> 47:52.840
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get

47:52.840 --> 47:57.840
I'm alone without you

47:57.840 --> 48:04.840
And I'm bored of what I'm supposed to do

48:04.840 --> 48:11.840
I'm alone, alone without you

48:11.840 --> 48:17.840
Start to start over

48:17.840 --> 48:24.840
This is me, I'm thinking of you Oh, I was arefought to actually walk around

48:24.980 --> 48:30.860
This is me, my eyes today Make my world a color of blue

48:30.860 --> 48:38.320
This is me, I'm thinking of you Oh, I was arefought to actually walk around

48:38.320 --> 48:46.820
This is me, my eyes today Make my world a color of blue

48:46.820 --> 48:54.820
So, that one was released this week as well as Y31. Unfortunately, I do not have the MP3 for Y31 right now.

48:54.820 --> 48:56.820
Oh, darn, bummer. What a shame. We can't hear it.

48:56.820 --> 49:06.820
But, if you're looking for the link, I don't remember exactly what it was off the top of my head, but I know if you go to our forums, which are on calibomani.com

49:06.820 --> 49:08.820
Good plug!

49:08.820 --> 49:13.780
And you can go there and you'll see a thread that's called kind of off topic but, and that's

49:13.780 --> 49:18.140
where I post everything because our Sacra mind boards are still down.

49:18.140 --> 49:22.420
And so that's where I post all these cool links that I find and you'll find the link

49:22.420 --> 49:23.420
in there.

49:23.420 --> 49:28.540
I need to get log in info.

49:28.540 --> 49:31.500
So you'll find the links there and he's releasing more.

49:31.500 --> 49:35.580
I can't remember what else he was working on but those are two that are definitely good.

49:35.580 --> 49:39.580
And then Colors was awesome, so.

49:39.580 --> 49:47.580
Other than that, you know, V-Rare 5 came out and people, you know, listened to that and there's some pretty good stuff on it.

49:47.580 --> 49:57.580
V-Rare 5 kind of sucked compared to the other ones. I mean, it was okay. I was all excited because it was all these trance remixes, but I don't know, Kind Lady just wasn't meant to be trance remix.

49:57.580 --> 49:59.580
I like that one.

49:59.580 --> 50:00.580
I don't. I don't.

50:00.580 --> 50:02.580
But Midnight Blaze was pretty good.

50:02.580 --> 50:04.580
I'm waiting for the safari trance edition.

50:04.580 --> 50:06.580
J.P.

50:06.580 --> 50:10.580
Uh, and Feelings Won't Fade was kind of just Look to the Sky again.

50:10.580 --> 50:12.580
Feelings Won't Fade, I Swear to God is another song.

50:12.580 --> 50:16.580
I've heard that synth chorus before or whatever.

50:16.580 --> 50:19.580
I've heard that melody before and I know it's another song.

50:19.580 --> 50:23.580
I know the dumb idiot ripped someone off, but I just have to find that original.

50:23.580 --> 50:26.580
Um, then I Feel was lame.

50:26.580 --> 50:30.580
What the hell was that? It was like, it was like Tori Amos doing I Feel.

50:30.580 --> 50:43.580
I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, I feel it

50:43.580 --> 51:11.580
Why do we crucify ourselves, and we hate it?

51:11.580 --> 51:38.140
I feel you, I feel you in me

51:38.140 --> 51:40.140
Like any all of a sudden

51:42.700 --> 51:45.900
Those people out there they're recording the bathroom and make another oh

51:47.700 --> 51:50.580
Oh, oh, oh, oh I feel

51:53.980 --> 51:57.620
The one the one I was okay now out of have to make a gift

52:00.960 --> 52:06.040
You know out of everything that it was unlocked in max 2 I'd have to say the best one haven't been like that

52:06.040 --> 52:11.560
do it right the 80s electro mix I love 80s music and that was awesome now and

52:11.560 --> 52:15.920
kindly the interlude was alright too look just guy transmits was alright as

52:15.920 --> 52:21.600
well but I don't know I'm just pissed that do it right has like so many remixes

52:21.600 --> 52:25.760
done to it so far and dead end has none you know what's cool about look to the

52:25.760 --> 52:32.120
sky transmits the background that's it the background is pretty cool I like it

52:32.120 --> 52:36.060
okay because it's actually it's a different song if you listen to the full

52:36.060 --> 52:37.460
version

52:37.460 --> 52:39.600
you can tell it's a different song

52:39.600 --> 52:43.120
now the one i was really pissed off on

52:43.120 --> 52:47.640
what the fuck was that? I think somebody got shot upstairs

52:47.640 --> 52:49.520
anyways uh...

52:49.520 --> 52:51.020
you know what what uh...

52:51.020 --> 52:51.840
i was

52:51.840 --> 52:55.080
pissed that they put on there because of course b for you has to you know

52:55.080 --> 52:59.640
eke its way in every single freaking game soundtrack you name it it's on there

52:59.640 --> 53:00.560
uh...

53:00.560 --> 53:01.480
and they did

53:01.480 --> 53:02.840
a cover of

53:02.840 --> 53:07.040
one films one of uh... nyoki saw the course paper euroby

53:07.040 --> 53:13.180
bad enough as it was in the mid-japanese

53:13.180 --> 53:16.360
actually well you know what i would play for you but i don't be a victory because

53:16.360 --> 53:17.560
i have it

53:17.560 --> 53:20.140
uh... i'll let me bring up

53:20.140 --> 53:21.220
well i'll tell you what

53:21.220 --> 53:24.760
it's kinda long for a break song but i'll uh... bring up we play clip from it

53:24.760 --> 53:27.780
i can play a lecture of the uh... eighties lecture of uh... do right now

53:27.780 --> 53:30.160
it's still dead right at the leader of it

53:30.160 --> 53:38.560
We'll play all the DDR edits during the next break, but here, I'll play Glacial cause Jamie, Jamie wants to hear it, so let's, we'll play a little bit of it, okay?

53:41.760 --> 53:43.760
No, the oven should be off, Bradley, thank you.

53:47.360 --> 53:48.860
We'll slap Jamie on the wrist.

53:48.860 --> 53:55.860
Okay, here's a little bit of glacial, okay?

54:18.860 --> 54:48.540
All right, that's a little clip of it.

54:48.540 --> 54:52.540
What do you think of that, Jamie? Jamie doesn't have a mic back there, does she? Go give her a mic.

54:54.540 --> 54:56.540
I like it. It's not Politary.

54:57.540 --> 55:01.540
Actually, with Politary singing it, though, she's actually in tune.

55:02.540 --> 55:04.540
That's the only reason why I actually like Hyper-Eurobeat.

55:05.540 --> 55:08.540
And it's got fun steps. Easy, but...

55:09.540 --> 55:11.540
It makes me want to burp or something.

55:12.540 --> 55:14.540
Did you want to watch a little bit of that porno now?

55:15.540 --> 55:16.540
Excuse me.

55:16.540 --> 55:17.540
Turn on the porn.

55:17.540 --> 55:19.140
Well, I set up for a break.

55:20.140 --> 55:21.140

55:21.140 --> 55:25.140
He's jumping to turn on the porn.

55:25.140 --> 55:30.140
I'm setting up for a break here.

55:30.140 --> 55:32.140
Play porn.

55:32.140 --> 55:34.260
Ooh, porn.

55:34.260 --> 55:35.260

56:29.220 --> 56:31.620
How exactly are these folks Nubian nurses?

56:31.620 --> 56:34.620
Cuz they're black and they're dressed up like nurses.

56:43.620 --> 56:46.620
Yeah, there's really no plot to this at all.

56:46.620 --> 56:51.620
It's just like, we're in a hospital and stuff happens and I'm horny now.

56:55.620 --> 56:56.620
What about all the patients that are dying?

56:56.620 --> 57:00.620
That chick that looks like Tyra Banks is having her tits eaten.

57:08.620 --> 57:10.620
Oh yeah, she has like a tan line.

57:17.620 --> 57:19.620
She has a big mole on her ass too.

Call your name and watch me through

01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:23.820
Every night is a night

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:30.820
Maybe if you don't please come back

01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:58.820
What are you guys watching now? You changed the porno and put something else in.

01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:03.820
That porn was boring, so we're watching Sailor Moon and the Seven Balls.

01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:10.820
Dear Lord, can we pause it or turn off the video or something for a minute so we can do the FUs of the week?

01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:14.820
So we can kind of get back to the show that we try to do every Sunday night here.

01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:22.820
I know you may have forgotten after a week off. Oh, big apologies, by the way, for episode 42.

01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:30.580
no shit I'm sure Loki enjoyed it basically what happened with that is if

01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:35.780
you're a regular the chat room you did get to see Jamie and myself and Brad was

01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:40.060
there too we did episode 42 on Thursday night so episode 42 it does exist it was

01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:46.460
done however I foolishly fucked up the archive file so Loki tried to do an

01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:51.620
episode 42 part 2 on Sunday night except we only had dial-up in the house at the

01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:53.620
It didn't quite work.

01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:57.620
What was the highlight of episode 42 for you, Jamie, the one that we did on Thursday?

01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:59.620
Going home.

01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:02.620
And isn't that always the best part of Orange Lounge Radio?

01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:05.620
Is turning it off.

01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:07.620
Just kidding. Jesus.

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:08.620
Alright.

01:05:08.620 --> 01:05:11.620
We don't even have to go home. We're already here.

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:15.620
Hey, that's gonna begin my fuck you week, by the way.

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:39.940
Okay, the first question of the week goes towards driving all the way at you using that

01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:52.940
gas and you live way the hell out of the way. I couldn't have been near my house. It's just,

01:05:52.940 --> 01:06:03.940
I mean, no one said zeroes, I'm glad I didn't. Drive for full speed. Oh, man. Actually, no,

01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:06.940
I don't know how you do it, but I guess it's enough, okay?

01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:09.940
Um, my other fike you of the week goes towards...

01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:11.940
Why'd you put my book down there?

01:06:11.940 --> 01:06:14.940
Before I would never be able to find it.

01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:17.940
Okay, someone put my book on the floor. Fike you, someone put my book on the floor.

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:20.940
Wasn't me. I didn't touch your book.

01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:22.940
Mm-hmm.

01:06:22.940 --> 01:06:23.940
Didn't you rub?

01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:25.940
I didn't do it.

01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:27.940
Wasn't me!

01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:28.940
Anyway.

01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:30.940
Check that book for prints, because I haven't touched it.

01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:31.940
Argh!

01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:39.940
My cue goes to A1 Comics Distributor for being sold out of the Battle Royale novel and I had a gift certificate to get it for free.

01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:43.940
And so I had to go and actually pay for the book in a book store.

01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:47.940
And then another cue goes to these old people who were tailgating me.

01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:52.940
So I decided to start going five miles an hour.

01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:56.940
And then I sped up and decided to take another lane.

01:06:56.940 --> 01:07:03.940
I can't really think of anything else because I'm really happy because I'm working now.

01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:07.940
Um, fuck you ghost for my sleep schedule for not resetting it.

01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:10.940
Because I'm the most popular.

01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:12.940
I think that's about it.

01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:13.940
Oh, what are you doing?

01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:17.940
Um...

01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:25.940
So fucking wet. Cry me a goddamn river. Fuck y'all.

01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:27.940
Okay, not you.

01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:34.940
like everybody else

01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:39.420
oh I'm sorry we're not done

01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:44.320
I'm sorry I wasn't meeting you and then everyone else

01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:46.440
oh yeah I have a fucking leak

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:50.840
but I think that she's going to address that so I won't say anything about it

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:53.200
I was going to say if you can't hear us

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:56.340
there's this little knob on the side of your speakers

01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:59.240
It's called volume. Stay with me now.

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:00.740
Volume.

01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:02.580
Turn it up.

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:05.980
We aren't talking louder.

01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:09.720
Okay, now my first episode of the week is going to be going to stupid drivers, of course.

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:14.380
But these, in particular, stupid drivers that don't know how to use the

01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:18.460
turn lane or the pull out lane or the suicide lane, whatever you want to call it,

01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:21.100
it's that double yellow lane that's inside

01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:24.820
you know, many sections of the road, you know, where you can pull in there, stop,

01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:28.820
and then turn out, you know, or turn out the traffic, and that kind of thing.

01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:34.020
People think that you're supposed to pace cars when you're in that lane.

01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:38.020
No, because you're obviously not going to get out of that lane. I'm not going to be able to get in that lane

01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:43.620
because you're going the same speed as I am. You're supposed to pull out, stop, wait for traffic to clear, then go.

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:50.420
It's pretty simple. But no, these dumb fucks out there, they don't understand that you're supposed to stop.

01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:56.600
That just... like, stop? How am I possibly gonna get up to speed if they make it in the traffic?

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:58.600
Ugh! Panic!

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.600
So, they suck.

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:10.600
Second FP of the week has to go to Net Zero because they suck ass, and I'm glad I won't have to pay for them pretty soon.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:21.600
But, um, yeah, they are now advertising that you can get, like, the stupid, uh, software-accelerated, uh, dial-up or something for five bucks, much more, when their service sucks so much anyways.

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.600
And watch, that's ten extra five bucks.

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:28.600
I hate them, but, you know, I've lived off them for a while.

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:34.600
Um, let's see what else is here. Um, I have to do unpacking, because it sucks. I don't like packing, or unpacking.

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:41.600
A little moving prop that sucks, but I just wish I could get some paint and sleep in the other house, and everything's intact.

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.600
But that just doesn't ever happen.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:47.600
And, um, let's see, what else?

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:52.600
Um, FD2, um, Shoddy, um, Builders of Apartments.

01:09:52.600 --> 01:10:00.600
Because this apartment for some reason has everything, like, cheaply made, and, like, the shower curtain kind of falls off the wall.

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:08.600
Let's see here, the drawers fall out of the drawers, the gas on the stove sometimes doesn't turn off, which is kind of dangerous.

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:12.600
Yeah, it's stuff like that, you know, you would just normally not think about.

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:21.600
So yeah, I do that, and um, let's see here, I don't really have that much board, you know, I was more angsty earlier in the week.

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:25.600
Mostly it's stupid people, because stupid people cause all the problems in the world.

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:29.240
the world. H.P.P. people don't look for where they're driving because they always try to

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:39.240
hit me. And just really dumb people out there. That's it. Oh, and um, F.U. to Jose, our um,

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:45.720
our cable um, installation guy. You're fucking dumbass didn't get here at the time. I wasted

01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:49.280
a whole fucking day waiting for your ass and you were still two hours late. You can kiss

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:54.120
my ass, you bastard, thinking you're going out of all your way just to fucking set up

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:58.320
a cable box which by looking at it I could have probably done myself you know

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:02.000
and I have to pay you $25 this free to be two hours late you should fucking have

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.840
to pay me this as a piece of shit up fucking digital cable another thing is

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:10.480
you need to mark all your fucking channels on stupid Comcast cable a lot

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:15.400
of these channels just say blank and you go there and oh look just TNN I wish they told me that

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:19.760
because then I'd be able to know what I'm watching it's just digital cables

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:42.760
kostjamrh I have a few FUs I'd like to give out this week, which is interesting because I'm not usually this angsty, but I'd like to give a big FU to whoever filed the noise complaint against Loki and I like our third night in the apartment.

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:46.760
If you think that was loud, you haven't heard anything yet.

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:58.760
That really sucked, because we weren't even that loud. We were just playing Max 2, kind of loud, and Loki was playing some of his new remixes at a medium volume.

01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:04.760
And somebody didn't like that, apparently. Well, poopy on you. Buy some earmuffs.

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:16.760
My next monkey of the week goes to the big poles that hold up the covered parking, because one of them took off my side mirror while I was backing out yesterday.

01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:22.760
Oops. It jumped out of nowhere.

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:29.760
kostjamrh And they fuck you to general lethargy, lethargy, and laziness on my part, and still have it in common.

01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:56.760
I haven't found a job yet. I'm lazy as shit.

01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:59.760
Let's see...

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:04.760
Fuck you to body parts that hurt sometimes, like back and feet.

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:11.760
So, my feet have been alright this week. I'm a back starter, but it's probably because I sat around in a chair for too long and stuff.

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:16.760
And then, fuck you to peer resets on WinMX.

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:23.760
I can download something from maybe a Japanese person, it times out or appears that you can't ever find that user ever again.

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:25.760
Or I could probably get mine.

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:26.760
Usually.

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:30.760
If I can use that Win 98, I can't use certain Japanese.

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:33.760
That's just, I didn't need to upgrade, so.

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.760
Well, not in 1.98.

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:39.760
With WinMX, though.

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:42.760
Because it's Unicode and you can't do that with Win 98.

01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:44.760
But I have enough code in there.

01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:46.760
That should happen soon.

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:49.760
Well, I'll figure it out someday.

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:50.760
Alright.

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:53.760
And... the fucking people don't share.

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:02.760
I'm like one of those people. You know, I'm downloading stuff and I'm like,

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:06.760
Oh, you're trying to download it too? Cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel.

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:07.760
I love doing that.

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:13.360
But um no f you to Catherine's eater Jones because you fucking suck your fat pig and you're pregnant

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:17.440
And you're smoking and then you're bitching about people take pictures of you smoking pregnant

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:21.960
And then you're like suing companies because they have nude photos of you standing on your balcony pregnant

01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:24.520
Well first off don't go out in public

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:28.320
Pregnant because we don't want to see you naked begin with and number two you're smoking

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:31.400
with a baby

01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:37.240
Well, that's all right. I'm sure you probably just want to make sure they're just as retarded as you are so there you go way to

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:46.240
I don't know if I'll share anything if I don't want people to download for me. I just create a folder with nothing in it for them to download out of.

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:48.240
They can download air!

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:57.240
What you need to do is create a giant text file and name it like matrix reloaded.avi

01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:02.240
Haha, fooled you!

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:13.240
I've decided on Ragnarok Online though and I'm going to get 50k skips and we're going to be getting 50k skips.

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:18.240
There's people out there going, you know, 10,000 yeni for cyber effects.

01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:23.240
So I'm going to do that, and then after they pay me, I'm going to, my repository will be, okay, you're fucked, I'll leave.

01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:28.240
You know what I think I want to do with the file sharing thing?

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:33.240
Because I want to put up files that say Matrix Reloaded, X-Men 2, and all this stuff,

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:36.240
and have them be episodes if you can't do that on television.

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:40.240
Because that show is the shit, and everybody should be watching those and not movies.

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:47.240
I was saying earlier that we should have a channel that plays old school Nickelodeon shows, like Slew Your Shorts and Hey Dude.

01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:59.240
They have, I think we have it on digital cable too, it's Nick Gas, Nickelodeon Games and Sports, and it shows like Guts and Wild and Crazy Kids and all these like old school Nickelodeon shows.

01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:03.240
Yeah, I think it shows old school Double Dares too. We have to look on the digital cable line and see if we have it.

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:05.240
I know we have it.

01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:08.240
That station is cool. Let's get to the chatroom FUs, shall we?

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:10.240
Because they're getting angsty.

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:17.240
Muhimer would like to say fuck trying to find a summer job. Fuck Microsoft Calendar for not working.

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:24.240
And now normally at this time of the year I would say fuck allergies, but the acupuncture therapy I'm doing has relieved all YM pollen allergies.

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:29.240
What sucks is I'm allergic to everything. I'm allergic to dust, molds, and pollen.

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:32.240
And I'm afraid of needles, so I'm screwed.

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:38.240
I suppose that's all, then. Oh, but fuck me for being so untan and white.

01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:44.240
You know what, I sympathize with you on that one.

01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:49.240
Oh, John Fields makes a good point. If you want to see old episodes of Pete & Pete, you can see those on Noggin.

01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:54.240
That's a cool station, too. Noggin has the old episodes of Square One. That's awesome.

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:59.240
Square One was the best show ever, like on PBS. It was MapNet.

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:06.240
ever, like on PBS, it was MathNet, you remember MathNet? Yeah. They showed that in your classroom

01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:14.620
game? Square One would be put into the classrooms every day, it was like a national thing. You

01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:19.620
subscribe to the Square One channel, and they would play them during the homework of your

01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:23.620
classroom. You'd let Square One play them in the classroom. Actually I could do my homework,

01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:25.620
It would be awesome.

01:17:53.620 --> 01:17:56.180
I've got a question on the boxes today.

01:17:56.180 --> 01:17:59.140
Oh, and FU to myself and Loki moving

01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:02.180
because now I don't live five minutes away from Justin V.

01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:04.700
Sorry.

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:12.220
All right.

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:14.440
John Fields would like to say FU to teachers

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:17.180
that give you six essays to do over one weekend

01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:18.380
when it's the end of the semester

01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:20.420
and it's time to study for finals.

01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:22.180
FU to old guy in wheelchair

01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:27.140
who doesn't wait for walk signs to appear to start crossing backwards so slowly in his

01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:28.660
wheelchair that I miss my light.

01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:33.660
Billy! Kill me! Kill me, Billy! Billy!

01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:38.660
There is a guy that does that. He has a cane and he doesn't even give a fuck. He doesn't

01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:43.660
even wait for the thing to turn. He's not going to make it in time when the thing turns

01:18:43.660 --> 01:18:48.660
to walk, so he just goes. And, you know, to hell with traffic. I love that episode where

01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:54.020
people like that grandpa's trying to die and he's like here's what it's like to be old

01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:57.060
and like listen to sail away and lock him in a room

01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:06.260
dark tetsuya would like to say a big fuck you to the little hacker one of these that

01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:11.140
joined in on our tetranet game it's sad too bad you guys probably suck too fucking badly

01:19:11.140 --> 01:19:14.660
at tetris that you have to use hacks like that in the first place it's a goddamn shame

01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:18.660
I mean Tetranet is old school. I was playing that years ago.

01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:20.660
What are they doing?

01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:22.660
My piece came with...

01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:24.660
Look, I dropped the piece the whole row.

01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:27.660
Maybe they turned it into Prontress or something, or I don't know.

01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:29.660
They were probably using cheats.

01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:30.660
I'm not trying one.

01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:34.660
An old-ass program like Tetranet is probably really easily hackable.

01:19:34.660 --> 01:19:37.660
So you can just instantly kill other people.

01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:39.660
Why don't you even hack Tetress or Pawn?

01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:42.660
You've got to be fucking bored to be hacking Tetranet. I'm sorry.

01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:49.660
the

01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:52.900
uh... twenty-third maggots like to say continued a few days

01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:54.740
kentucky for obvious reasons

01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:58.180
if you'd been super ghetto broke i can even buy lunch cold chicken is what i

01:19:58.180 --> 01:19:59.220
have to bring

01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:01.140
glacial but why anyone

01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:03.680
but i was a mommy joe

01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:06.700
if you to hacker one of these on tetranet lucky bastards can even play

01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:13.700
play Tetris. Oh, little bastards can't even play Tetris. Get a fucking clue.

01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:23.100
DDR Angel would like to say that my F.U. of the week goes to the county supreme court.

01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:29.580
F.U. for being called to jury duty. It's my first one and I don't know what to expect.

01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:32.820
Worse yet, I could have been working tomorrow and making more money than a dollar an hour

01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:37.740
during your doing jury duty remember no matter what they're guilty oh and guess

01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:44.900
what DDR angel has episode 42 so maybe it won't be so lost after all we might

01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:47.660
be able to get that later

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:55.620
okay snub dissanoid has a lot of them this week so brace yourselves ladies and

01:20:55.620 --> 01:21:00.700
gentlemen first off to my algebra to teacher go suck an elephant shitter to

01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:05.900
teach efficiently, follow these simple steps. 1. Pull hairs out of asshole. 2. Teach the

01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:09.940
fucking course. I think that because I finished my working class, I reserve the right to read

01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:13.480
a fucking book. I don't see anywhere in the fucking handbook that states you get to throw

01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:18.320
out students that are done with work and reading books. I'm awfully sorry if your wife won't

01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:21.780
give you any, but leave it at home and stop sending me out of your class. I didn't get

01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:25.400
to play any Bomani this week. In fact, I didn't get to do anything outside of sitting on my

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:29.840
ass. Fuck you. And also, fuck you to the fucking 200 pound kid that jumped on my fucking spine

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:34.320
in Judo class. If you can't jump over me when I'm lying down, don't fucking try it. It's

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:38.200
your fat impairing your judgement to the point where you can't understand what you can and

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:42.280
can't do. You fucking displaced my spine, you dumb shit face. Why don't you eat your

01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:47.280
own shit nuggets, pal? He's a fat kid, you are not in the Matrix, and you do not know

01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:54.280
Kung Fu. Finally, a big fat fucking shit eat my shit logs fuck you to Comcast for being

01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:58.920
Fucking fucking queefish little shit to change the cable channels.

01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:03.540
I want to watch my fucking TV, not wonder what the fucking channels are.

01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:04.540
Also fuck my deck drive.

01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:05.780
All part of the game.

01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:08.120
Fuck my deck drive for not fucking working.

01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:09.160
Fucking piece of shit.

01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:11.880
I don't know it costed money to be pissed off these days.

01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:14.240
Or I didn't know it costed money to be pissed off these days.

01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:15.240
Could be worse.

01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:16.240
You could have an MPX changer.

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:19.660
That thing's a piece of shit.

01:22:19.660 --> 01:22:22.160
Another fucking novel courtesy of Snub Destroyed.

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:26.160
I was going to say, um, there's another F.U. I had.

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:27.160
Uh, tough.

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:28.160
Baby.

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:29.160
Okay.

01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:30.160
It's gone.

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:36.160
And Merrin would like to say, a big F.A.C.K.U. man to Hulk Hogan.

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:38.160
Hulk, you need to retire, brother.

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:42.160
P.S. give back my kurtie.

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:46.160
He's gone.

01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:47.160
And that, ladies and gentlemen.

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:56.760
The first WWE thing that I see after years, or a year, is, first of all, Roddy Piper needs

01:22:56.760 --> 01:23:03.000
to retire too, or needs to get back in the gym, okay, no, there's more, but he brings

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:10.720
out the newly sight unseen, iron contracted person, Mr. America, who comes out to real

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:16.960
American and does all the poses and it's Hulk Hogan in another persona and he

01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:23.400
can't be fired this would be retiring because he's fucking old dude they're

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:28.760
gonna like tap him and he's gonna break his arm and I'm the only one that

01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:33.080
doesn't watch wrestling well I saw him retire I was like flipping their channels

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:37.600
on this big he retired oh my god he's gone I'm like finally maw he was cool

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:43.560
back in the day but now he's coming back it's like go away just die die I'm sorry

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:46.880
but the coolest wrestler of all time is Andre the Giant because he was in the

01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:54.000
Princess Bride and that makes him cooler than anybody else disagree with me I

01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:02.560
dare you okay let's do a quick break no let's not let's just get into the cage

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:06.800
match you guys wanna do cage match you wanna do a break come back talk yeah I

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:08.800
Yeah, I need to figure out which song I'm picking.

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:11.800
Okay, so you want to do a breakdown. We'll do a breakdown. We'll do Cage Match a little later.

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:19.800
I am going to play a little song. JB sent me a bunch of MP3s tonight of new SyFam things.

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:28.800
Yeah, what was that one, they want to play Max Resurrection. Dude, that song's old. They could play it on the show. It's a decent remix of Max, but there's better.

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:33.800
Well, since it's been in demand so much, let's just play it. We'll satisfy folks and play it.

01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:35.800
Like Max Unity, that's pretty good.

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:37.800
Do I have it? They said they sent it to me, but it's not...

01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:38.800
I have it. I have it.

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:40.800
You have it? Alright, you play it.

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:41.800
We can play it.

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:44.800
Alright, I'll start off with...

01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:48.800
Let's see, I said I'd play one of these SyFam ones that JB sent me.

01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:50.800
Um...

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:53.800
I don't want to play one that's super-duper long.

01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:56.800
Sorry about the noise. It's me switching through folders.

01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:57.800
Let's play, um...

01:24:57.800 --> 01:24:59.800
Go folders.

01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:01.800
Go, go.

01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:04.800
Well, this one's not too bad. We'll play this...

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:09.800
Well, that one's kind of long. All these are really long that he sent me, because they're all like extended mixes.

01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:12.800
I can play stuff during the break.

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:15.800
I promised I'd play one of these. Let's just do this.

01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:20.800
It's another Judy Crystal song that's not in any DDR that I've seen yet. It's called Boom Boom Boom.

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:22.800
And we'll play that.

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:26.800
Oh, I'm sorry. This isn't SyFam. This is LED Records.

01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:29.800
My bad. Sheesh.

01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:34.800
You're the sci-fams whore and all of a sudden now you're the LED whore. How am I supposed to know?

01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:35.800
Stop pouring yourself out.

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:38.800
I don't keep tabs on people. Stop pouring yourself out to every record label.

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:44.800
Then maybe I can keep tabs on these things better.

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:49.800
Alright, I'm sorry. Oh, Loki, you want to start with max redirection, or I'll play max redirection, and then we'll play some...

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:47.800
Boom boom boom, playin' rhythm should be do-bop

01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:39.580
Boom, boom, boom

01:30:09.580 --> 01:30:11.580
Let's get back into the heat

01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:27.580
Fun, juice, me, soul

01:30:27.580 --> 01:30:30.080
Fun, juice, me, soul

01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:36.720

One, two, three, four.

01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:26.960
With your heart, I have it

01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:28.160
Boom, boom, boom

I've been to all my life

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:52.400
I'm standing by your side

01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:53.840
We're not giving up

01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:55.200
Come on, baby

01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:26.320

01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:36.160
Boom, boom, boom

01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:37.600
Dancing with the fire

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:40.080

From the Step Squad to Orange Pals, this GTR sucks!

01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:43.280
Hi, we're back and I'm eating a popsicle right now.

01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:45.160
It's very yummy.

01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:46.160
It's strawberry.

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:47.480
If any of you guys want a popsicle, you can have one.

01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:50.040
Oh, we have some new guests here in the house.

01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:51.040
Say hello.

01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:54.120
I know it's warm here, so you have to have the windows.

01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:59.120
It's getting hot in here, or in her, sorry, I thought I was supposed to do that.

01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:01.120
Let me, like, bend forward here.

01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:05.120
Hi, this is Leggings Style, fucking it up with Rice Princess over here.

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:07.120
Haro.

01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:08.120
Is it on?

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:09.120
Yeah, it's on.

01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:10.120
Okay, good.

01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:11.120
Okay.

01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:13.120
Yo, yo, yo, biznatches.

01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:15.120
You've got soul.

01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:18.120
Have you done anything interesting in Bemani this week?

01:34:18.120 --> 01:34:25.120
Yes, I downloaded the Sampling Masters CDs. If you guys want to get some pictures of that, please let me know.

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:28.120
I'll take a few pictures. Okay, cool.

01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:31.120
And we can even put some of the stuff up on the Orange Lounge, huh?

01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:33.120
There's some good stuff in there.

01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:35.120
We'll think about it.

01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:39.120
I'm gonna kill it. No, I'm just kidding.

01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:41.120
Yes, Irene, you have a request.

01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:44.120
I just want you to play the original Telephone Operator.

01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:49.120
I don't think I have it readily available. I can play the edit. That's about the best I can do for you right now.

01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:50.120
Do you?

01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:51.120
Yes, yes.

01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:53.120
All right, well later, later. We'll get to it later.

01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:54.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:06.120
We have dead air right now because none of you have a mic.

01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:10.120
I'm reading.

01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:15.120
Everyone else has been so busy talking about stuff and the fikes were going on long so I was like, I'll read.

01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:20.120
There's 29 more students to go.

01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:29.120
What do we have here? The novel of Battle Royale. Oh no.

01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:35.120
Jamie's Battle Royale infatuation addiction has gone to a new level.

01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:38.120
This is a pretty interesting outfit. It's like red and black.

01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:41.120
It's a very stylish book.

01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:43.120
It's like school colors.

01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:44.120
Yeah, there you go.

01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:47.120
I think that's just the blood on their black outfits.

01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:50.120
Um, so Bradley, what's up?

01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:52.120
You've got the other mic.

01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:55.120
Uh, I don't know. How much?

01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:59.120
I was listening earlier. I was listening to the Orange Lounge before I came here.

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.120
I was over at my apartment.

01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:04.120
And as soon as you guys said fuck yous, time for Fuck Yous of the Week, I turned it off.

01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:08.720
The guy turned it off.

01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:10.760
Well, fuck you too.

01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:15.680
A late F.U. to Brad for being a bitch.

01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:18.760
The book Battle Royale was written in 1999.

01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:19.960
Nice.

01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:27.720
Okay, so we're going to be doing the cage match pretty soon here.

01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:33.360
What do you want to bake a cake for?

01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:35.360
Yeah, boy, this is great.

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:37.360
Okay, are we just going to do the cage match then?

01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:39.360
Alright, we'll go to the cage match.

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:41.360
Okay, three songs. So, your song off the CD, yes, Jimmy?

01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:43.360
Okay.

01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:45.360
Yes, we all have new songs.

01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:57.360
Well, we're going to reset, because just of everything that happened with Episode 42, and Loki admitting his song a couple weeks ago was crappy, taking it out, huh?

01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:00.360
My song was cool and now I can't use it again.

01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:03.360
You can use it again later, because that show is technically lost.

01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:04.360
Later, maybe.

01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:05.360
Later, maybe.

01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:06.360
What song was that?

01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:07.360
None of Your Business.

01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:08.360
Fuck you, buddy.

01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:11.360
I'll play it another week.

01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:13.360
I'll tell you off air.

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:16.360
If you were a fan of that song, it'll come back another week. No worries.

01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:18.360
That's a big surprise for those people who aren't paying attention.

01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:21.360
Okay, so we're going to start with Loki.

01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:27.360
do the whole little music and everything we have to make this official

01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:29.360
doo doo doo doo doo

01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:30.360
official?

01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:31.360
it has to be

01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:34.360
yes, i know it's hot in here i mean

01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:36.360
so, here we go

01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:44.360
last week in the orangelaunch cage match it got ruined by yours truly

01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:49.360
so, we start anew tonight with 3 brand new songs and the way the cage match works

01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:58.900
You vote for your favorite, and the winning song will go into rotation on Orange Lounge,

01:37:58.900 --> 01:38:03.000
Bomani Music, and more, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on the station when we're

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.000
not here.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.500
So, each of the hosts picks a song to go in, and we start tonight with Loki.

01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:10.220
Loki, tell us about your song.

01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:16.800
My song I heard on a trance compilation CD a while back, and then of course since I bought

01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:21.120
turntables. I bought the vinyl for it, so I have, you know, the actual clean edit for

01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:26.520
it. Um, this one is, um, a song you might remember her from the song, Sexual, she sang

01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:29.920
a while back, and they were like, oh yeah, I feel sexual. I don't know if you've heard

01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:36.680
that song. Anyways, um, this one's called Yes. It's the HQ2 Big Room Club edit, because

01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:43.680
because the full version is 9 minutes long, and this one is pretty long as it is. So here we go!

01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:32.320
The sun was in the hills, water in the canyon Here, wrought by the sun, I brushed up against

01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:50.680
I put my arms around you, yeah And you're down to me

01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:54.680
Yeah, yeah

01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:57.680
I put my arms around you, yeah

01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:01.680
And you were down to me so you could feel my breath

01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:06.680
And it's hard to go like that

01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:12.680
Let's see, are you okay?

01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:20.680
Blue rose in the sky, as we lay together

01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:27.680
One second goes by, then becomes forever

01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:33.680
Come to you by deciding

01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:41.680
And I'm not asking with my eyes to ask again, yes

01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:48.680
And then he asked me would I, yes, yes

01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:52.680
I put my arms around him, yes

01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:56.680
And drew him down to me so he could feel my breath

01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:59.680
And his arms were so like a man

01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:06.680
And yes, yes, I put my arms around him, yeah

01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:10.680
And drew him down to me so he could feel my breath

01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:13.680
And if I could go like that

01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:20.680
And yes, yes, I'll do it

01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:24.680
And drove him down to me so he could feel vibrant

01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:28.680
And his heart was so like man

01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:35.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:35.680
okie dokie

01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:47.560
alrighty that was amber with yes and was that some kind of remix loki?

01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:51.000
it was the hq2 big room club mix

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.880
alright let's see what everyone thought of that

01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:54.280
bradley

01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:58.280
I didn't hear all that much of it, but it sounded okay. I gave it, like, seven, ten, four, five.

01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:32.280
And her pick, what we'll do is we'll come back at the end and tell what we thought of all these songs.

01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:37.280
We're gonna do, this is Jamie's pick, it's the Terminator 2 Techno Rave Mix.

01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:44.280
And we'll be back.

01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:20.720
Okay, that was Terminator 2, the trance remix.

01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:25.800
And that was Jamie's pick for tonight's Orange Lounge Radio cage match.

01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:30.640
Alright, so we're gonna go on to the third song and we'll come around and see what everyone

01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:31.960
thought of them when we're done.

01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:36.280
Now I always have to pick something crazy, so I certainly did tonight.

01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:43.780
This is one of the old-school vinyls that came in Loki's pack of 100 vinyls that he ordered.

01:49:43.780 --> 01:49:51.960
And this is Raven Simone, who you might remember as the littlest girl on the Cosby Show.

01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:56.460
She did a song, and this song rules, and it's called That's What Little Girls Are Made Of.

01:49:56.460 --> 01:49:59.820
So we're getting old-school right here, and this is my cage match pick for tonight.

01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:06.820
This is Raven Simone with That's What Little Girls Are Made Of.

01:50:29.820 --> 01:50:31.820
I got the hoes and the niggas and the niggas

01:50:31.820 --> 01:50:33.820
And the niggas and the niggas and the niggas

01:50:33.820 --> 01:50:34.820
And the niggas and the niggas and the niggas

01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:35.820
Take a dick while I kick

01:50:35.820 --> 01:50:36.820
I stop to see some dicks

01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:37.820
Tingling a boom

01:50:37.820 --> 01:50:38.820
I talk when you pick

01:50:38.820 --> 01:50:39.820
Jizzing

01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:41.820
Kick, jam, the little rock

01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:43.820
Sing to your tune to the middle rock

01:50:43.820 --> 01:50:44.820
Slash, gobble, zoom

01:50:44.820 --> 01:50:46.820
Gobble, gobble, got my lyrics

01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:47.820
Home for the double hutt

01:50:47.820 --> 01:50:48.820
See it all the month

01:50:48.820 --> 01:50:49.820
Yeah

01:50:49.820 --> 01:50:50.820
Good such the system of all that

01:50:50.820 --> 01:50:53.820
Fiddle bee, bubble bee, kick the foxy deck

01:50:53.820 --> 01:50:54.820
Who's gonna play

01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:55.820
Back with show and tell

01:50:55.820 --> 01:50:56.820
We only have a love squad

01:50:56.820 --> 01:50:57.820
Call him fairytale

01:50:57.820 --> 01:50:58.820
Boom, doo, doo

01:50:58.820 --> 01:51:03.820
So I left her room full of love, said baby This is what the little girls are made of

01:51:03.820 --> 01:51:07.820
That's what little girls are made of That's what little girls are made of

01:51:07.820 --> 01:51:11.820
That's what little girls are made of

01:51:11.820 --> 01:51:14.820
Well, we on the way to the R.I.P.E.

01:51:14.820 --> 01:51:19.820
And when I saw a brown and I just flipped to the fan I could get laid back on your neck, patty back

01:51:19.820 --> 01:51:23.820
Give the dog a bite and now some candy in the back Roll him over, roll him over, bake him in the pan

01:51:23.820 --> 01:51:30.820
I just can't be a dickie dummy one just do it And you can take me for sure, I might cut

01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:33.820
a trim Criss-totter, you got the floor knotted

01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:36.820
You got the bowl, got a stick, somebody had to swing

01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:38.820
This is what girls are made of, sugar and spice

01:51:38.820 --> 01:51:39.820
And dine for all the slaves

01:51:39.820 --> 01:51:44.820
I got more rhymes, because we got show I got more news, because we got more

01:51:44.820 --> 01:51:48.820
I support the women outside girls I sock on my back, I pour the jugs in my hands

01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:50.820
And my fans will say

01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:24.020
Now the rave makes a twist, like the house of pain and junk

01:52:24.020 --> 01:52:25.820
Rave and gunna pop from the fat beat

01:52:25.820 --> 01:52:27.520
Make it to the rager, I'm so cold

01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:29.820
Kinda talk to me from the Jojo to see

01:52:29.820 --> 01:52:32.020
Reminisce, think you like cooking with Mary B

01:52:32.020 --> 01:52:34.220
Cause I'm not the one, not the one to play

01:52:34.220 --> 01:52:36.820
But get your ball in your back cause this song is a hit

01:52:36.820 --> 01:52:39.220
Give and see what I see, and see what I bring

01:52:39.220 --> 01:52:41.420
And if you like the rager, maybe it's more like a wang

01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:43.820
Cause if you like to see me, then honey don't shove

01:52:43.820 --> 01:52:46.420
Cause I'm a pile of sugar, and this is what I'm made of

01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:53.420
X for little girls I made it X for little girls I made it x2

01:52:53.420 --> 01:53:21.860
Oops, I think that one shut off a little early.

01:53:21.860 --> 01:53:27.340
I think any of you guys really minded that at all, but that was Raven Simone with that's what little girls are made of I

01:53:28.340 --> 01:53:32.140
Did that on accident? I was trying to unmute the mics and I ended up muting them my bad

01:53:33.140 --> 01:53:37.100
So anyway, I have to take a phone call great

01:53:37.780 --> 01:53:39.780
How wonderful?

01:53:40.380 --> 01:53:43.300
Loki go around and get people's thoughts on all three of those songs. Would you?

01:53:43.300 --> 01:53:46.300
Okie dokie. Ooh, I got the mic that's long.

01:53:46.300 --> 01:53:49.300
Dude, this mic right here, you can broadcast anywhere in the house.

01:53:49.300 --> 01:53:50.300
What'd you think of the song?

01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:53.300
Uh, first one was... mine.

01:53:53.300 --> 01:53:54.300
Yeah.

01:53:55.300 --> 01:53:56.300
Um, here.

01:53:58.300 --> 01:54:00.300
They all seemed pretty good.

01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:02.300
I just didn't hear them all that well.

01:54:02.300 --> 01:54:04.300
I remember when the Raven and Simone one came out,

01:54:04.300 --> 01:54:07.300
they showed up at the end that was how we feel, I think.

01:54:08.300 --> 01:54:10.300
It was like, uh, oh!

01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:13.100
Oh, yeah, it's like 10 years ago.

01:54:14.900 --> 01:54:16.900
Dude, he's playing tug-of-war with a cow.

01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:19.400
Dude, check this out. Check this out, man.

01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:21.100
He's playing tug-of-war with a cow.

01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:23.200
It's like the greatest show ever.

01:54:24.700 --> 01:54:29.300
If you've got TNN at home right now, turn into his most extreme elimination challenge.

01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:32.100
I tell you, man, it's the most kick-ass show ever.

01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:34.600
They are playing tug-of-war right now with a bunch of different things.

01:54:34.700 --> 01:54:35.100
Watch this guy.

01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:36.600
Hey, wait, you're not talking about Cagematch.

01:54:36.700 --> 01:54:38.200
He's gonna get screwed right now.

01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:40.200
Watch this, this is so wrong.

01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:42.200
Because the other guy had a...

01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:46.200
So they don't tell them what they're going to pull against?

01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:51.200
They run down the line of ropes there, and they have to pick a random rope, and each rope's attached to something different.

01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:58.200
And this one, the last one, the little girl, the girl gets a tug of war against some idol.

01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:02.200
So, what did we think of those three songs?

01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:28.200
Yes, it was cool because I picked it. Nah, it was alright. It sounded better on the CD because it probably was shorter on the CD. The Terminator 2 one sucked. At first I thought it was going to be, there was another song called Turn Up The Blaster or something like that. It's some scooter song that sounds like the Terminator 2 thing. I thought that was what it was going to be at first. But, nah, it was alright. And then, that's what little girls are made of.

01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:30.420
um... one of the hundreds of

01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:34.320
records i have to listen to because i don't recognize any of these names

01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:35.040
but um...

01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:36.420
you know the right

01:55:36.420 --> 01:55:40.900
it's kind of repetitive which is kind of knowing

01:55:40.900 --> 01:55:44.800
what anybody else have a comment they want to give on one of those songs

01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:47.080
that was a good cigarette out there

01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:49.240
sorry i wasn't in here here it's so

01:55:49.240 --> 01:55:52.680
massively else

01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:56.000
first was okay i couldn't really hear it uh...

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.040
was okay

01:55:57.040 --> 01:56:04.760
The second one, I don't know how, I guess I didn't hear how it sounded anything like Terminator, but whatever, um, it was okay too.

01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:08.520
The third one was, like, really silly.

01:56:08.520 --> 01:56:10.440
That you picked it, Rob. Yeah.

01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:11.600
Of course.

01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:12.860
But it was okay.

01:56:12.860 --> 01:56:20.040
I'll say what I thought. The Amber song, I've heard better from Amber. That one was a little too weird. It was too diva-ish for me.

01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:23.560
I've got some more, too. See, that wasn't the one I wanted. No, no, that was enough.

01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:34.560
That wasn't the one I won the pick this week. It was actually the one I won the pick was, I don't remember the title, but I have another one called The Need To Be Naked.

01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:37.560
Ah, I think I've heard that song before.

01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:44.560
And the second song was okay. It was alright.

01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:50.560
And then the third song was awesome, of course, because it was old school.

01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:56.000
So, you can send in those votes now to me, I'm Skye, I'm in the chat room, and once we

01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:00.840
have a winner, we'll let you know, and that song will go into rotation on Orange Lounge

01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:01.840
Radio.

01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:06.480
We're going to go to break, because there's a lot of chaos going around in the studio

01:57:06.480 --> 01:57:11.640
right now, so we need to take a quick break, and hope you bear with us, and we will be

01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:14.640
back very soon.

01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:25.440
oh do it all night do it with me i'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free babe

01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:28.700
Do it tonight, do it all right

01:57:28.700 --> 01:57:31.800
Just take me and shake me till I burn up inside

01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:49.940
You may have got sex with Sam and Fred and Fritz and Max

01:57:49.940 --> 01:57:53.280
You may be the slave of Tim and Tom and Ed and Dave

01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:56.560
You may do it again with hands and friends and check and care

01:57:56.560 --> 01:58:00.240
But you're gonna feel so free when you do it with me

01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:03.920
Do it all night, do it with me

01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:06.800
I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free

01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:10.560
Baby, do it tonight, do it all right

01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:13.600
Just take me and shake me till I burn up inside

01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:17.360
Oh, do it all night, do it with me

01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:20.640
As hard as a fire and as strong as a tree

01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:24.040
Do it tonight, do it all right

01:58:24.040 --> 01:58:27.540
You got it, I knew it, you can do it tonight

01:58:35.140 --> 01:58:38.740
Your song is a fire, a straw is a tree

01:58:38.740 --> 01:58:45.740
Come on, do it with me.

02:00:08.740 --> 02:00:12.740
A

02:00:12.740 --> 02:00:16.740
B

02:00:16.740 --> 02:00:20.740
A

02:00:20.740 --> 02:00:24.740
G

02:00:24.740 --> 02:00:28.740
A

02:00:28.740 --> 02:00:32.740
D

02:00:32.740 --> 02:00:36.740
A

02:02:36.740 --> 02:02:43.740
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:03:06.740 --> 02:03:24.740
I remember this because this was last night. Last night I watched The Price is Right. They had this million dollar special where they were giving out prizes that were just like thousands and thousands of dollars. One of the prizes that they had...no. Well, it was close. It was Pump It Up.

02:03:24.740 --> 02:03:26.740
Whoa! Holy crap!

02:03:26.740 --> 02:03:30.740
They had a Pump It Up machine that they were giving away as a prize and the lady didn't win it because she's a dumbass.

02:03:30.740 --> 02:03:32.740
Fuckers!

02:03:32.740 --> 02:03:36.080
I would yeah, she wouldn't appreciate it

02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:43.060
Yeah, but seriously the prize is okay the prizes you normally like a normal showcase would be like twenty thirty thousand maybe

02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:48.420
Every now and then this was like the one showcase was a hundred one thousand dollars

02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:54.040
Wow, I would have been on there and fucking the guy like one like he won a trip to England

02:03:54.040 --> 02:03:58.140
He want a new car and a boat and then there was like

02:03:58.140 --> 02:04:01.140
Like, some other thing that he won that was like...

02:04:01.140 --> 02:04:03.140
They should have had a 2DX machine on there, I would have won it.

02:04:03.140 --> 02:04:09.140
No, but they had a pump-it-up machine, they had some NHL game, and then they had something else.

02:04:09.140 --> 02:04:10.140
I forget what else.

02:04:10.140 --> 02:04:14.140
I would have gone on Price is Right if I knew, because they don't usually give away video games and stuff.

02:04:14.140 --> 02:04:15.140
Well, this is a special.

02:04:15.140 --> 02:04:16.140
A tea set!

02:04:16.140 --> 02:04:18.140
And you know how normally...

02:04:18.140 --> 02:04:20.140
A fondue plate dish or something.

02:04:20.140 --> 02:04:22.140
Was it that stupid wheel that they spin?

02:04:22.140 --> 02:04:25.140
How you land on a dollar, thousand dollars that you land on and again you normally get ten thousand?

02:04:25.140 --> 02:04:26.140
Yeah.

02:04:26.140 --> 02:04:28.140
Well, because this was the special million dollar show.

02:04:28.140 --> 02:04:30.140
It was $10,000 and $100,000?

02:04:30.140 --> 02:04:32.140
No, it was $1,000 and a million.

02:04:32.140 --> 02:04:33.140
What?

02:04:33.140 --> 02:04:34.140
Yeah.

02:04:34.140 --> 02:04:35.140
What?

02:04:35.140 --> 02:04:40.140
But your odds of getting that are pretty... unless you cheat.

02:04:40.140 --> 02:04:41.140
That's cool.

02:04:41.140 --> 02:04:43.140
I remember the time I went to see The Price is Right.

02:04:43.140 --> 02:04:44.140
It was so wonderful.

02:04:44.140 --> 02:04:45.140
I want to go.

02:04:45.140 --> 02:04:46.140
I want to go back so bad.

02:04:46.140 --> 02:04:47.140
I know I get...

02:04:47.140 --> 02:04:51.140
I do get nostalgic when I think about The Price is Right because it was so wonderful.

02:04:51.140 --> 02:04:53.140
I had a great time.

02:04:53.140 --> 02:05:00.140
Bob Barker is my hero, he's like 90 years old or something and he's got like the fakest

02:05:00.140 --> 02:05:01.140
tan, he's always like...

02:05:01.140 --> 02:05:05.340
It's not really that he has a fake tan, his makeup is orange, he looks orange in person.

02:05:05.340 --> 02:05:08.740
Yeah, on the TV he doesn't look so orange, but what I've heard is when you go there to

02:05:08.740 --> 02:05:11.740
the studio he's like, he's a fucking tangerine dude.

02:05:11.740 --> 02:05:17.100
You ever wonder what happened to the Oompa Loompas when they grew up?

02:05:17.100 --> 02:05:18.100
Bob Barker?

02:05:18.100 --> 02:05:19.100
Seriously?

02:05:19.100 --> 02:05:27.100
So, dude, Bob Barker's my hero. He's like 90 years old or something and he's got Poonanee running around his studio like nothing and they want him.

02:05:27.100 --> 02:05:38.100
Now, if you had to put Bob Barker versus Hugh Hefner in a fight, didn't you see Happy Gilmore? The price is wrong, bitch.

02:05:38.100 --> 02:05:45.100
Wait, that was, I'm saying, that's fine. Anyway, still, Bob Barker kicks some ass in that fight. Best fight scene ever in Hollywood. What do you think, Rob?

02:05:45.100 --> 02:06:01.100
I remember that when we went and saw The Price is Right being filmed live, they can do little question and answer sections between, like when there's commercial breaks usually, Bob Barker's doing like this little question and answer thing, and somebody asked about, like, will there ever be a Happy Gilmore 2?

02:06:01.100 --> 02:06:04.100
He's not the one producing the movie, how would he know?

02:06:04.100 --> 02:06:07.100
I don't know, or has he been asked, or I don't remember what the exact question was.

02:06:07.100 --> 02:06:08.100
That's funny, though.

02:06:08.100 --> 02:06:14.100
Anyway, let's reveal tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, and it's quite a shocker.

02:06:15.100 --> 02:06:22.100
By only one vote, the winning song was...

02:06:29.100 --> 02:06:34.100
That's right, it was Raven Simone with That's What Little Girls Are Made Of, was tonight's Cage Match winner.

02:06:34.100 --> 02:06:40.800
That's the track. That's the joint. That's the cut. And all those ghetto slang.

02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:45.860
And it won by a whopping one vote. How many people voted, or can you say on there?

02:06:45.860 --> 02:06:47.540
A handful. A handful. Okay.

02:06:47.540 --> 02:06:52.060
Not as many as usual, but not the least I've ever seen vote in a cage match.

02:06:52.060 --> 02:06:56.560
But I think there were a lot of people like, I ain't voting for any of that shit.

02:06:56.560 --> 02:07:01.940
For any of it, yeah. Basically like the real presidential polls nowadays, you know?

02:07:01.940 --> 02:07:06.020
I actually had to think about it for a minute because people were voting yes.

02:07:06.020 --> 02:07:07.660
I'm like, what do you mean you vote yes?

02:07:07.660 --> 02:07:09.700
Oh, yeah, we had a song called Yes.

02:07:09.700 --> 02:07:12.180
You don't vote yes or no on a...

02:07:12.180 --> 02:07:14.660
You don't vote yes or no on the cage match, you stupid punks.

02:07:14.660 --> 02:07:15.660
I'm still playing baseball?

02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:16.660
We did have a yes.

02:07:16.660 --> 02:07:17.660
Okay, sorry.

02:07:17.660 --> 02:07:18.660
Okay.

02:07:18.660 --> 02:07:22.820
So, as I mentioned a second ago, you might have missed it because we were talking about

02:07:22.820 --> 02:07:23.820
cage match.

02:07:23.820 --> 02:07:24.820
Jamie left.

02:07:24.820 --> 02:07:30.140
She had another situation she had to take care of, so she's left the building, but we've

02:07:30.140 --> 02:07:31.640
got plenty of guests still here.

02:07:31.640 --> 02:07:36.720
We have Brad and Irene, the Ice Queen, walked in at some point during the cage match in

02:07:36.720 --> 02:07:38.720
the corner.

02:07:38.720 --> 02:07:42.240
Anita and Dart Child are on their way and they keep calling me from different places

02:07:42.240 --> 02:07:47.280
going I don't, I can't find it, we're in Mexico and we can't find your place.

02:07:47.280 --> 02:07:51.600
Well it's hard to drive when you're getting pleasured in the car.

02:07:51.600 --> 02:07:52.600
Ohhhhhh.

02:07:52.600 --> 02:07:53.600
Wow.

02:07:53.600 --> 02:08:00.060
Anyway, so, but, we thought we'd use this opportunity since we're really low on ideas

02:08:00.060 --> 02:08:07.060
a material. Irene had something she wanted to do for a while now. You're going to have

02:08:08.500 --> 02:08:13.460
to explain this because even I don't know how this works. Oh wait, we have to have theme

02:08:13.460 --> 02:08:19.820
music. Sorry, we have to have theme music for this. Give me a minute here because we

02:08:19.820 --> 02:08:25.140
have to have theme music for this. It's going to be a segment. Irene, what is this segment

02:08:25.140 --> 02:08:30.860
Well, I introduced it a couple of weeks ago into the chat room, an idea, it's called Orange

02:08:30.860 --> 02:08:32.180
Crush.

02:08:32.180 --> 02:08:35.260
That's right, it's time for Orange Crush.

02:08:35.260 --> 02:08:39.020
Yeah, I hope not.

02:08:39.020 --> 02:08:45.020
Orange Crush, Orange, Orange Crush, Orange Crush, it's time for Orange Crush.

02:08:45.020 --> 02:08:46.340
Go kick your ass.

02:08:46.340 --> 02:08:48.500
Okay, how does Orange Crush work?

02:08:48.500 --> 02:08:53.980
Okay, well, it was kind of a, I don't know, basic idea, I don't, nothing's finalized,

02:08:53.980 --> 02:08:59.140
But we could basically take two people from the studio, and we're going to ask them questions,

02:08:59.140 --> 02:09:00.140
the same set of questions.

02:09:00.140 --> 02:09:04.140
One person, I guess, can just leave while we ask one person, and then they can come

02:09:04.140 --> 02:09:06.900
back, and then the other person will leave, and blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:09:06.900 --> 02:09:07.900
Yeah, and it's timed.

02:09:07.900 --> 02:09:11.880
You know, you have 30 seconds to answer five questions, which really shouldn't take too

02:09:11.880 --> 02:09:12.880
long or anything.

02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:13.880
So it's a trivia game?

02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:14.880
Yeah, pretty much.

02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:15.880
Wow.

02:09:15.880 --> 02:09:16.880
And there's a theme to each one.

02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:17.880
Oh, okay.

02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:20.880
So someone's knocking on the door, and that's really scary.

02:09:20.880 --> 02:09:23.180
Did someone drop a spoon?

02:09:23.180 --> 02:09:28.180

02:09:28.180 --> 02:09:34.180

02:09:34.180 --> 02:09:40.520

02:09:46.820 --> 02:09:49.860

02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:15.660
just raise your hand

02:10:15.660 --> 02:10:18.260
Bradley will be one.

02:10:18.260 --> 02:10:21.540
And oh, you or Matt, whoever.

02:10:24.580 --> 02:10:28.460
OK, it'll be Dark Child, I guess.

02:10:28.460 --> 02:10:29.020
I don't know.

02:10:29.020 --> 02:10:31.180
So Dark Child and Bradley.

02:10:31.180 --> 02:10:33.860
So since Dark Child just got here, he can go first.

02:10:33.860 --> 02:10:36.820
And Brad, why don't you take Bradley outside.

02:10:36.820 --> 02:10:38.980
And into the soundproof booth.

02:10:38.980 --> 02:10:40.020
Now, we need a timer.

02:10:40.020 --> 02:10:41.860
I don't have a timer.

02:10:41.860 --> 02:10:43.740
Can someone count to 30?

02:10:43.740 --> 02:10:44.420
Anybody?

02:10:44.420 --> 02:10:45.860
Anybody in the audience?

02:10:45.860 --> 02:10:46.660
What did I volunteer for?

02:10:46.660 --> 02:10:49.020
Does somebody have a watch with a stopwatch?

02:10:49.020 --> 02:10:50.780
It's a little segment that we've introduced.

02:10:50.780 --> 02:10:52.900
Oh, I can play 30 seconds of a song.

02:10:52.900 --> 02:10:53.140
Yeah.

02:10:53.140 --> 02:10:53.740
We'll do that.

02:10:53.740 --> 02:10:54.240
OK.

02:10:54.240 --> 02:10:55.860
Can you explain Orange Crush to me?

02:10:55.860 --> 02:10:57.220
Because I'm a noob still.

02:10:57.220 --> 02:10:59.380
One more time for those who aren't paying attention.

02:10:59.380 --> 02:11:03.340
It's basically a trivia game where we have 30 seconds.

02:11:03.340 --> 02:11:05.340
We ask you five questions, however many you get.

02:11:05.340 --> 02:11:09.540
You're competing against Bradley to answer more questions.

02:11:09.540 --> 02:11:10.860
Oh, he needs a microphone.

02:11:10.860 --> 02:11:11.860
He needs a microphone.

02:11:11.860 --> 02:11:12.340
Hold on.

02:11:12.340 --> 02:11:13.500
Let's get him wired up here.

02:11:13.500 --> 02:11:43.260
Okay, the theme of this one is called Love Me Do.

02:11:43.260 --> 02:11:44.260
I'll let you figure it out.

02:11:44.260 --> 02:11:45.260
Yeah.

02:11:45.260 --> 02:11:46.260
Okay.

02:11:46.260 --> 02:11:47.260
So can we...

02:11:47.260 --> 02:11:48.260
Hold on.

02:11:48.260 --> 02:11:49.260
Oh, he has to queue up the music.

02:11:49.260 --> 02:11:50.260
Okay.

02:11:50.260 --> 02:11:52.660
So basically, what you're expecting is questions about Akira Yamaoka.

02:11:52.660 --> 02:11:53.660
Akira Yamaoka.

02:11:53.660 --> 02:11:54.660
I've fucked.

02:11:54.660 --> 02:11:55.660
Yeah.

02:11:55.660 --> 02:11:56.660
Yeah, I know.

02:11:56.660 --> 02:11:57.660
Okay.

02:11:57.660 --> 02:11:58.900
Ready to start the clock and go.

02:11:58.900 --> 02:12:02.060
What year was Akira Yamaoka born?

02:12:02.060 --> 02:12:03.420
1968.

02:12:03.420 --> 02:12:05.380
Okay.

02:12:05.380 --> 02:12:08.380
What town was he born in?

02:12:08.380 --> 02:12:11.580
Nagasaki, Japan.

02:12:11.580 --> 02:12:13.100
Okay.

02:12:13.100 --> 02:12:15.400
What is his favorite movie?

02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:18.320
Battle Royale.

02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:21.320
What instrument does he play?

02:12:21.320 --> 02:12:25.320
Keyboard, guitar, saxophone.

02:12:25.320 --> 02:12:29.120
We have to take your first one.

02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:30.680
And the last question is...

02:12:30.680 --> 02:12:31.680
That's it.

02:12:31.680 --> 02:12:32.680
Oh, that's it?

02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:33.680
Oh, whoops.

02:12:33.680 --> 02:12:34.680
That's four questions.

02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:35.680
I'm sorry.

02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:36.680
No, I don't.

02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:37.940
Okay, so that's four questions.

02:12:37.940 --> 02:12:40.780
You got none of them right.

02:12:40.780 --> 02:12:41.780
What a surprise.

02:12:41.780 --> 02:12:46.780
Who is that? Is that a person on 2DX or something?

02:12:46.780 --> 02:12:47.780
Are you kidding me?

02:12:47.780 --> 02:12:48.780
No, I'm not.

02:12:48.780 --> 02:12:49.780
Kiryamaoka?

02:12:49.780 --> 02:12:50.780
He does the music in 2DX.

02:12:50.780 --> 02:12:51.780
I didn't know that.

02:12:51.780 --> 02:12:52.780
He does some music in 2DX.

02:12:52.780 --> 02:12:53.780
It's Bradley.

02:12:53.780 --> 02:12:58.780
I kicked ass, dude.

02:12:58.780 --> 02:13:01.780
He's like coming running from around the corner.

02:13:01.780 --> 02:13:02.780
Woohoo!

02:13:02.780 --> 02:13:03.780
You won, Bradley!

02:13:03.780 --> 02:13:04.780
No, I'm kidding.

02:13:04.780 --> 02:13:07.780
Okay, just to give you confidence, he didn't get any of them right.

02:13:07.780 --> 02:13:08.780
Oh, okay.

02:13:08.780 --> 02:13:14.660
Oh, I mean, he got all of them right.

02:13:14.660 --> 02:13:15.660
Damn.

02:13:15.660 --> 02:13:16.660
Okay.

02:13:16.660 --> 02:13:17.660
Are you ready?

02:13:17.660 --> 02:13:18.660
Yeah.

02:13:18.660 --> 02:13:19.660
Oh, okay.

02:13:19.660 --> 02:13:27.660
The theme of it is called Love Me Do, and there are questions about the Kiriyamaoka.

02:13:27.660 --> 02:13:30.740
I don't know if I've told them to you or not, but whatever.

02:13:30.740 --> 02:13:34.780
Okay, so start the 30 seconds now.

02:13:34.780 --> 02:13:36.660
What year was the Kiriyamaoka born?

02:13:36.660 --> 02:13:37.660
I don't know.

02:13:37.660 --> 02:13:38.660
Okay.

02:13:38.660 --> 02:13:45.660
he born in? Okinawa. Okay, what's his favorite movie?

02:13:48.500 --> 02:13:55.500
What instrument does he play? Violin. Okay, what 2DX video and aid style does he appear

02:13:55.500 --> 02:14:02.500

02:14:05.300 --> 02:14:07.180

I think I know the last two for sure, but I don't know about the other ones as well, yes.

02:14:29.340 --> 02:14:30.340
What year was he born?

02:14:30.340 --> 02:14:34.340
I would say he's probably in his 20s, which would mean he was probably born in 73.

02:14:34.340 --> 02:14:35.340
What was it?

02:14:35.340 --> 02:14:36.340
He was born in 1967.

02:14:36.340 --> 02:14:37.340
Oh.

02:14:37.340 --> 02:14:38.340
Really close.

02:14:38.340 --> 02:14:39.340
One year off.

02:14:39.340 --> 02:14:40.340
Okay.

02:14:40.340 --> 02:14:42.340
What city was he born in?

02:14:42.340 --> 02:14:44.340
I would just go generic and say Tokyo.

02:14:44.340 --> 02:14:45.340
Yes, you're right.

02:14:45.340 --> 02:14:46.340
Tokyo.

02:14:46.340 --> 02:14:48.340

02:14:51.340 --> 02:14:52.340
Oh, Bound.

02:14:52.340 --> 02:14:54.340
Bound. You told me that. That's right.

02:14:54.340 --> 02:14:58.340
You know Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon. It's his favorite.

02:14:58.340 --> 02:15:00.340
Bound is an awesome movie.

02:15:00.340 --> 02:15:02.340
Sure.

02:15:06.340 --> 02:15:08.340
What instrument does he play?

02:15:08.340 --> 02:15:09.340
He plays the drums.

02:15:09.340 --> 02:15:12.340
No, he doesn't. He plays the guitar.

02:15:12.340 --> 02:15:15.340
He confirmed that he's the guitarist in the game.

02:15:15.340 --> 02:15:17.340
Oh, but okay, but the last one.

02:15:17.340 --> 02:15:19.340
The last one is what video does he appear in?

02:15:19.340 --> 02:15:24.060
I knew that yeah, but somebody told me he played the drums and dancer who lied oh

02:15:25.460 --> 02:15:27.660
You know who it is the person that told you

02:15:32.140 --> 02:15:37.060
But his main instruments the guitar somebody told me why but wait, but I thought he played the drums

02:15:38.020 --> 02:15:39.740
the skin flute

02:15:39.740 --> 02:15:45.500
Close well, which guitarist is he is he the one that's doing this thing or is he the one wearing the skirt?

02:15:46.300 --> 02:15:48.300
He's the cool one

02:15:48.300 --> 02:15:50.300
these are all rah rah rah rah rah rah rah

02:15:50.300 --> 02:15:52.300
black hair with a little bit of red dye

02:15:52.300 --> 02:15:54.300
We can show you if you want to watch the video

02:15:54.300 --> 02:15:56.300
not really

02:15:56.300 --> 02:15:58.300

02:16:10.300 --> 02:16:12.300

ya'll fear your tattoo right now

02:16:16.300 --> 02:16:20.300
It's skin tone. That's what the tattoo is.

02:16:20.300 --> 02:16:24.300
Does this make Anita hot and bothered?

02:16:24.300 --> 02:16:28.300
Oh Rob, you have such a sexy touch.

02:16:28.300 --> 02:16:32.300
Am I the only one who notices that he doesn't have a tattoo there and you're just rubbing his bare chest?

02:16:32.300 --> 02:16:36.300
It's a tattoo the color of skin.

02:16:36.300 --> 02:16:40.300
I don't have anything else to say.

02:16:40.300 --> 02:16:44.300
Hi everyone.

02:16:44.300 --> 02:16:48.300
How was your guys' week?

02:16:48.300 --> 02:16:51.300
Prior to coming here or after coming here?

02:16:51.300 --> 02:16:54.300
Either. Both. We had a lot of time to fill, so both.

02:16:54.300 --> 02:16:58.300
I don't know. Whenever I came.

02:16:58.300 --> 02:17:02.300
It was pretty good. Good week, I guess.

02:17:02.300 --> 02:17:06.300
I'm still unemployed, which sucks, but I guess it was a good week.

02:17:06.300 --> 02:17:10.300
Was at the ranch this weekend.

02:17:10.300 --> 02:17:16.740
Yeah, we were at Darkchild's mom's ranch, we saw horsies, we saw puppies, I didn't get

02:17:16.740 --> 02:17:17.740
to ride yet.

02:17:17.740 --> 02:17:18.740
I have a tan.

02:17:18.740 --> 02:17:21.860
Oh, yeah, that's from work, actually.

02:17:21.860 --> 02:17:27.060
I get to go out in the sun at work, and I have, like, sandal tans on my feet.

02:17:27.060 --> 02:17:30.620
So that's when I work out on the river and playing with fishies.

02:17:30.620 --> 02:17:31.620
Yay!

02:17:31.620 --> 02:17:32.620
Yeah?

02:17:32.620 --> 02:17:34.660
I play with fishies!

02:17:34.660 --> 02:17:38.180
I chop them into pieces.

02:17:38.180 --> 02:17:39.180
But they're already dead.

02:17:39.180 --> 02:17:40.180
I know.

02:17:40.180 --> 02:17:41.180
I should work at a sushi bar.

02:17:41.180 --> 02:17:43.180
I'm going to bring you guys salmon this year.

02:17:43.180 --> 02:17:44.180
I'm going to try.

02:17:44.180 --> 02:17:45.180
Oh, that's so cool.

02:17:45.180 --> 02:17:46.180
If you like salmon, I'll bring salmon.

02:17:46.180 --> 02:17:47.180
I like food.

02:17:47.180 --> 02:17:48.180
So any food is cool.

02:17:48.180 --> 02:17:50.620
It'll be from the hatchery.

02:17:50.620 --> 02:17:51.620
It's fresh salmon.

02:17:51.620 --> 02:17:54.920
It's not like mercury salmon, is it?

02:17:54.920 --> 02:18:00.180
It's from the Feather River, so they're just coming up from the ocean, so they don't have

02:18:00.180 --> 02:18:01.180
a lot of mercury.

02:18:01.180 --> 02:18:02.660
They're not like a thermometer, are they?

02:18:02.660 --> 02:18:03.660
No.

02:18:03.660 --> 02:18:04.660
Not at all.

02:18:04.660 --> 02:18:05.660
They're ocean fish.

02:18:05.660 --> 02:18:06.660
They're not from the Bay.

02:18:06.660 --> 02:18:07.660
Alright.

02:18:07.660 --> 02:18:13.360
their life out in the ocean, so most of the food that they eat is mercury free, so they're

02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:14.360
predators.

02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:19.920
The only predators that live in the San Francisco Bay that eat the little creatures that are

02:18:19.920 --> 02:18:23.000
in the San Francisco Bay have a lot of mercury in them.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:27.980
Anyway, that's a science note from Science Corner, Anita's little Science Corner.

02:18:27.980 --> 02:18:34.680
It's the science segment, we do the science segment, got it.

02:18:34.680 --> 02:18:38.480
Other than that, yeah, we saw puppies and we saw horses because they raised horses and

02:18:38.480 --> 02:18:39.480
puppies there.

02:18:39.480 --> 02:18:47.400
Yeah, miniature Doberman Pinschers, and Min Pins, Doberman Pinschers, and Toy Fox Terriers.

02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:50.080
They were very cool.

02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:51.080
They're so cute.

02:18:51.080 --> 02:18:52.080
We saw little tiny babies.

02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:54.080
They're like two weeks old.

02:18:54.080 --> 02:18:57.640
Aww, everybody.

02:18:57.640 --> 02:19:00.840
Yeah, whatever.

02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:01.840
Animals, whatever.

02:19:01.840 --> 02:19:04.560
Yeah, it's old news for me.

02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:07.560
Do you have any exciting Bahmani news of our guests that just showed up?

02:19:08.560 --> 02:19:11.560
I finally full combo'd the Beauty of Silence.

02:19:12.560 --> 02:19:13.560
You go, boy.

02:19:13.560 --> 02:19:14.560
Flight 7.

02:19:17.560 --> 02:19:19.560
I have no new Bahmani news.

02:19:20.560 --> 02:19:22.560
I've barely played in the past couple of weeks.

02:19:23.560 --> 02:19:24.560
I'm nuttin' over the game.

02:19:25.560 --> 02:19:27.560
All over the keys and everything.

02:19:28.560 --> 02:19:31.560
And I play on the left side, Rob. Just like you.

02:19:31.560 --> 02:19:33.560
Yay, Left Side Bride!

02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:35.560
Left Side represent!

02:19:35.560 --> 02:19:37.560
Left Side!

02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:41.560
See, and we even have like gay signs.

02:19:41.560 --> 02:19:43.560
Bostards!

02:19:43.560 --> 02:19:55.560
As Loki puts his finger and thumb up to his forehead, and everybody's trying different hand signals.

02:19:55.560 --> 02:19:59.560
Who else wants a hand signal that I can describe?

02:19:59.560 --> 02:20:06.560
Okay, uh, this guy is doing a very interesting little hand signal for the crotch.

02:20:06.560 --> 02:20:11.560
And Darkchild is licking his nipple.

02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:16.560
Discussions on hand signals makes excellent radio, by the way.

02:20:16.560 --> 02:20:18.560
Did you guys already talk about X2?

02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:19.560
No.

02:20:19.560 --> 02:20:20.560
Oh, it's so good!

02:20:20.560 --> 02:20:22.560
X2! X2 News!

02:20:22.560 --> 02:20:24.560
It's so good!

02:20:24.560 --> 02:20:25.560
When what?

02:20:25.560 --> 02:20:27.560
Of course, we don't spoil.

02:20:27.560 --> 02:20:28.560
We never spoil.

02:20:28.560 --> 02:20:29.560
Spoiler free review, please.

02:20:29.560 --> 02:20:30.560
We never spoil.

02:20:30.560 --> 02:20:33.560
It came out on Friday.

02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:34.560
X-Men 2, the movie?

02:20:34.560 --> 02:20:35.560
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:36.560
Yeah.

02:20:36.560 --> 02:20:37.560
Oh, hold on.

02:20:37.560 --> 02:20:40.560
Irene's having a conversation with Matt who doesn't have a mic.

02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:46.240
Okay, um, Darkchild asked something that's not exactly a spoiler, but should I give this

02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:47.240
information out?

02:20:47.240 --> 02:20:48.240
Does everybody agree?

02:20:48.240 --> 02:20:49.240
What is the question?

02:20:49.240 --> 02:20:50.240
He asked if Gambit is in the movie.

02:20:50.240 --> 02:20:52.720
Gambit's scene was cut from the movie.

02:20:52.720 --> 02:20:53.720
I agree.

02:20:53.720 --> 02:20:55.720
Uh is right.

02:21:55.720 --> 02:21:59.720
Okay, right by Arco Arena there's a huge movie theater, and we went to go see X2 over there,

02:21:59.720 --> 02:22:00.720
and it was great.

02:22:00.720 --> 02:22:04.760
I mean, we bought the tickets off online, the online site where you can buy tickets,

02:22:04.760 --> 02:22:07.440
and we went, and we had to stand in this huge ass line, and we were kind of towards the

02:22:07.440 --> 02:22:13.240
back waiting to get into the theater, but then one of the friends, a friend that I went

02:22:13.240 --> 02:22:16.800
to the theater with, he has a friend that works at the theater, so we had to cut to

02:22:16.800 --> 02:22:17.800
the front of the line.

02:22:17.800 --> 02:22:21.320
We had to go to the VIP side, so we were the first ones in the theater.

02:22:21.320 --> 02:22:23.240
So we had to go in and pick any seat we wanted.

02:22:23.240 --> 02:22:26.960
So we sat right in the middle where you can put your feet up kind of, it's like right

02:22:26.960 --> 02:22:30.160
where the stadium seating part begins so you can put your feet up on the bars and stuff.

02:22:30.160 --> 02:22:32.680
We're sitting there, we're getting excited, the movie's about to start.

02:22:32.680 --> 02:22:35.460
Five minutes before the movie starts, all the lights go out and the emergency lights

02:22:35.460 --> 02:22:36.460
come on.

02:22:36.460 --> 02:22:38.360
We're sorry, the power's out.

02:22:38.360 --> 02:22:40.780
And how long was it out for?

02:22:40.780 --> 02:22:44.880
Long enough so that they escorted us out of the theater and gave us tickets to see another

02:22:44.880 --> 02:22:46.600
movie at another time.

02:22:46.600 --> 02:22:47.600
But did you go back in?

02:22:47.600 --> 02:22:48.600
So what a waste of two hours.

02:22:48.600 --> 02:22:50.080
Did you go back in to watch it?

02:22:50.080 --> 02:22:51.080
No, we couldn't.

02:22:51.080 --> 02:22:52.080
Oh, okay.

02:22:52.080 --> 02:22:53.080
It was gone.

02:22:53.080 --> 02:22:54.080
They called me.

02:22:54.080 --> 02:22:57.240
You had called me earlier, or later, and I thought you said that they started the movie

02:22:57.240 --> 02:22:58.240
up.

02:22:58.240 --> 02:22:59.240
No, no.

02:22:59.240 --> 02:23:00.240
The manager came in.

02:23:00.240 --> 02:23:01.240
Oh, okay.

02:23:01.240 --> 02:23:02.240
And was shooing us all out.

02:23:02.240 --> 02:23:03.240
So that really sucked.

02:23:03.240 --> 02:23:08.720
Yeah, I have some friends that went to go see it that same day, but they were in the

02:23:08.720 --> 02:23:12.240
theater a little earlier, so they were halfway through the movie when the car went out.

02:23:12.240 --> 02:23:13.240
Oh, yeah.

02:23:13.240 --> 02:23:14.240
And they gave us tickets to go back later.

02:23:14.240 --> 02:23:15.960
I was saying it's gotta really suck to be those guys.

02:23:15.960 --> 02:23:18.120
That's why I was telling my friend that I went with us.

02:23:18.120 --> 02:23:20.760
Now, it sucks for us, but it really sucks for them.

02:23:20.760 --> 02:23:21.760
At least you weren't halfway through the movie.

02:23:21.760 --> 02:23:28.020
and saw Princess Mononoke. Rob, you reminded me of one of my fuck you's I need to say for

02:23:28.020 --> 02:23:34.840
the week. Fuck you to Bombay. See, Bombay, you didn't get to go to see the premiere of

02:23:34.840 --> 02:23:39.260
it on Thursday. No, he has a friend who works in the movie theater, so he saw it Wednesday

02:23:39.260 --> 02:23:43.500
at midnight before it was even supposed to be shown in theaters. Those freaking people

02:23:43.500 --> 02:23:46.380
who work in the theater always get those nice little deals. I wonder what they're going

02:23:46.380 --> 02:23:49.700
to do for The Matrix, though, if they're going to have FBI people there who aren't going

02:23:49.700 --> 02:23:55.620
to let him in to see the movie early. Agents, agents, Darkchild says agents.

02:23:55.620 --> 02:24:01.780
I've got tickets for 545 opening day. 545 opening day? I've got to get some tickets

02:24:01.780 --> 02:24:07.180
too so we can go. Loki, Loki, I'm going to have premiere passes.

02:24:07.180 --> 02:24:10.840
So what, do I care? Are you sure you can get in with premiere passes?

02:24:10.840 --> 02:24:15.220
I usually don't let you use any kind of passes on brand new movies until two weeks.

02:24:15.220 --> 02:24:19.420
okay radio station

02:24:19.420 --> 02:24:20.740
uh... yeah i guess

02:24:20.740 --> 02:24:24.500
i guess premiere want to see that movie so badly i know everybody how it seemed

02:24:24.500 --> 02:24:26.340
on seconds

02:24:26.340 --> 02:24:27.780
that we've been a part of the

02:24:27.780 --> 02:24:29.300
that's my

02:24:29.300 --> 02:24:30.980
i have to bring a new pair of shorts

02:24:30.980 --> 02:24:33.900
i'm going to be like eight times

02:24:33.900 --> 02:24:36.920
you're one of those people who's gonna dress up in like the black trench coat in

02:24:36.920 --> 02:24:42.060
the glasses i already own that shut up

02:24:42.060 --> 02:24:46.560
I normally wear a trench coat, so that's not a trench coat!

02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:49.620
Trench coats go down to your ankle!

02:24:49.620 --> 02:24:55.740
Just because I don't have the glasses that don't have like the side arm thing, they just stick onto your nose like Morpheus had.

02:24:55.740 --> 02:24:59.500
Morpheus glasses are pimps, too bad they're three hundred dollars, so I can't afford them.

02:24:59.500 --> 02:25:03.020
Let's go get some knockoffs in Mexico or something, I'm sure.

02:25:03.020 --> 02:25:07.620
Yo, look at me as the lens pops out.

02:25:07.620 --> 02:25:10.340
Yo, yo.

02:25:10.340 --> 02:25:14.000
Would you like to go deeper down the rabbit hole or whatever the fuck he said?

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:17.700
Cornhole? I was reading some review on aintitcoolnews.com

02:25:17.700 --> 02:25:21.300
where this guy just kept overusing the words fuck and come

02:25:21.300 --> 02:25:24.900
and pissed myself like in his review of Matrix Reloaded because I guess it's been

02:25:24.900 --> 02:25:28.340
screened already at Khan Film Festival and stuff.

02:25:28.340 --> 02:25:30.120
That's funny.

02:25:30.120 --> 02:25:33.980
How mature.

02:25:33.980 --> 02:25:35.460
It was probably one of the... Hee hee.

02:25:35.460 --> 02:25:36.640
I said fuck.

02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:38.820
It was probably uh...

02:25:38.820 --> 02:25:41.620
what's-his-name the one of the

02:25:41.620 --> 02:25:42.580
uh... one of those

02:25:42.580 --> 02:25:45.820
that's one of the guys died that the two movie critics

02:25:45.820 --> 02:25:48.440
physical neighbor yeah i'm still a little rubber

02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:51.500
you know i don't see the rubber it's probably even

02:25:51.500 --> 02:25:54.140
shit but uh... uh...

02:25:54.140 --> 02:25:56.780
there's one thing i don't want to think about

02:25:56.780 --> 02:26:00.540
he was uh... you worship but i'm not about that yeah yeah yeah i'm sitting on

02:26:00.540 --> 02:26:01.780
the toilet a river

02:26:01.780 --> 02:26:03.840
ready late pretty late

02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:06.460
pretty late

02:26:06.460 --> 02:26:11.460
And he was too lazy to write up another review, so he just copied the one from the porn movie and used it for The Matrix.

02:26:11.460 --> 02:26:16.460
Yeah, he posted a porn movie review and he thought it, you know, because he didn't want to make up a Matrix review.

02:26:16.460 --> 02:26:17.460
And that's why it said that.

02:26:17.460 --> 02:26:18.460
It was probably a Scott film.

02:26:18.460 --> 02:26:23.460
And he just changed the names of the characters to, like, Neo.

02:26:23.460 --> 02:26:28.460
When Neo took Morpheus from behind, it was the most excellent scene I ever saw in my life.

02:26:28.460 --> 02:26:31.460
The anal matrix.

02:26:31.460 --> 02:26:35.460
Would you like to go deeper down the hole?

02:26:35.460 --> 02:26:40.460
See how far this hole takes you.

02:26:40.460 --> 02:26:42.220
I know kung fu.

02:26:42.220 --> 02:26:48.980
Eleventy billion dollars.

02:26:48.980 --> 02:26:55.780
So go see Max- Max- Whoa, I know GHB.

02:26:55.780 --> 02:26:57.500
X-Men 2.

02:26:57.500 --> 02:27:00.820
Remember just like, this is totally how the clerks animated.

02:27:00.820 --> 02:27:03.060
Totally how the clerks animated the uh...

02:27:03.060 --> 02:27:06.180
where they're like the beef jerky

02:27:06.180 --> 02:27:07.940
you know the teacher he comes

02:27:07.940 --> 02:27:09.140
i remember that

02:27:09.140 --> 02:27:12.300
remember when they're doing the very at the very and we walked out of store is

02:27:12.300 --> 02:27:15.260
that the whole episode where there's a carnival going on across the street

02:27:15.260 --> 02:27:19.980
and the very and he walks through the door out only beef jerky and he walked

02:27:19.980 --> 02:27:25.220
out into the construct and then way off topic

02:27:25.220 --> 02:27:29.140
doses but i don't think i made it i think there is a large

02:27:29.140 --> 02:27:30.040
as of europe

02:27:30.040 --> 02:27:32.820
if you're fans of kevin smith of the clerks and i it's one of the greatest

02:27:32.820 --> 02:27:38.340
cartoons ever proof that the greatest shows get banned or kicked off TV all the time like

02:27:38.340 --> 02:27:44.180
and the guy like got more play than yeah haters and got like a couple seasons too though didn't

02:27:44.180 --> 02:27:49.860
it you got two seasons before um the coach john avasco has pulled it off because uh nickelodeon

02:27:49.860 --> 02:27:54.020
is trying to make it more kid with friendly comedy central is supposed to be picking up

02:27:54.020 --> 02:28:01.500
clerks the animated like it's starting a new like new episodes i'm sure they'll show the

02:28:01.500 --> 02:28:05.860
the first six, but maybe, hopefully. But Kevin Smith said there's no more Jay and Silent

02:28:05.860 --> 02:28:12.220
Bob in anything. Well, that's a lie already, because they are doing a Clerks animated movie,

02:28:12.220 --> 02:28:14.900
and so I'm sure he's going to be, you know, Jay and Silent Bob have to be mad. Well, the

02:28:14.900 --> 02:28:19.500
only reason they're doing no Jay and Silent Bob is because Jay's missing in action. Jay,

02:28:19.500 --> 02:28:26.740
yeah. What happened? I don't know. Did he turn tail and run out of the country, is what

02:28:26.740 --> 02:28:28.740
Out of the country, he's dead.

02:28:28.740 --> 02:28:34.740
He's not dead, he's hiding on some island somewhere because of his convictions or whatever.

02:28:34.740 --> 02:28:36.740
Conviction, that's not the right word, is it?

02:28:36.740 --> 02:28:37.740
I don't know.

02:28:37.740 --> 02:28:41.740
Didn't he talk about Jason Mewes being banished, though, at an evening with Kevin Smith?

02:28:41.740 --> 02:28:42.740
I don't know.

02:28:42.740 --> 02:28:45.740
Because, I guess, Warren, he brought that up and then Jason Mewes walks up on stage

02:28:45.740 --> 02:28:47.740
and he knows where Jason is.

02:28:47.740 --> 02:28:48.740
Who knows?

02:28:48.740 --> 02:28:55.740
It's like one of the biggest conspiracies since the whole biggie, Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac thing, you know?

02:28:55.740 --> 02:28:58.740
Is he really dead?

02:28:58.740 --> 02:29:02.740
I just think Jay ran off with booboo kitty fuck.

02:29:02.740 --> 02:29:06.740
Sorry, I don't know who booboo kitty fuck is.

02:29:06.740 --> 02:29:10.740
Anyway, I think he ran off with strong bad.

02:29:10.740 --> 02:29:15.740
So, on another note...

02:29:15.740 --> 02:29:19.740
Rob's over here eating fucking pretzels. Do your job.

02:29:19.740 --> 02:29:21.740
What job?

02:29:21.740 --> 02:29:25.420
Okay, we're going to go to a break real fast, and then we're going to come back.

02:29:25.420 --> 02:29:28.900
Huh? Well,

02:29:28.900 --> 02:29:32.100
I've been making my living with the kind of job we call blow.

02:29:32.100 --> 02:29:36.580
Anyway,

02:29:36.580 --> 02:29:40.100
yes. We go to break now,

02:29:40.100 --> 02:29:43.300
and after break, we're going to come back with

02:29:43.300 --> 02:29:48.580
Ask Orange Lounge, where you can ask any of the members of Orange Lounge a

02:29:48.580 --> 02:29:49.580
question that you want.

02:29:49.580 --> 02:30:03.580
Um, except Jamie, because she's not here right now, but you can ask me, you can ask Loki, you can ask a Rice Princess or Lanky Style, you can ask Dark Child or DDRHolic, you can ask Arcadian42, or you can ask the Ice Princess.

02:30:03.580 --> 02:30:09.580
Oh, sorry, the Ice Queen. I'm sorry, are you a princess or a queen? He's a queen. He's more of a queen than a-

02:30:09.580 --> 02:30:14.580
Well, then you're definitely a queen.

02:30:14.580 --> 02:30:21.660
All right, so we'll be right back after some music and we're going to be doing Ask Orange

02:30:21.660 --> 02:30:22.660
Lounge.

02:30:22.660 --> 02:30:23.900
So send those questions right now to me.

02:30:23.900 --> 02:30:29.220
My name is Skye and I'm in the chat room and we're going to play a couple tracks from some

02:30:29.220 --> 02:30:38.780
Dance Mania albums and we're going to start it off with something from Dance Mania Fantasia

02:30:38.780 --> 02:30:42.020
and this is one of our most popular tracks in Orange Lounge Radio Rotation.

02:30:42.020 --> 02:30:49.020
of an SMA with Destiny.

02:34:12.020 --> 02:34:13.020
Give it up, give me what it takes

02:34:13.020 --> 02:34:14.120
Back, back, back

02:34:14.120 --> 02:34:16.120
I don't even know if you and I love my acts

02:34:16.120 --> 02:34:18.020
I love the moment, you be strong

02:34:18.020 --> 02:34:20.020
I don't know what I'm gonna do

02:34:20.020 --> 02:34:21.420
I gotta warn you

02:34:21.420 --> 02:34:23.920
I'm gonna have sex with your ex

02:34:23.920 --> 02:34:25.320
Who'll make you look this way?

02:34:25.320 --> 02:34:28.120
That's not a match, baby, take it easy

02:34:28.120 --> 02:34:30.520
Take this life, I'm gonna have sex with you, ex

02:34:30.520 --> 02:34:31.620
Who will look you up?

02:34:31.620 --> 02:34:33.120
This life, I'm this life

02:34:33.120 --> 02:34:35.720
For you too and I'm just feeling like

02:34:35.720 --> 02:34:36.620
Like that

02:34:37.220 --> 02:34:38.620
I gotta warn you

02:34:38.620 --> 02:34:40.220
Who are you?

02:34:40.220 --> 02:34:43.220
Don't have sex with your ex, baby

02:34:45.220 --> 02:34:47.220
I love you

02:35:05.220 --> 02:35:07.220
Well I'm back, I'm back, if you call me back

02:35:20.220 --> 02:35:22.220
I gotta warn you

02:35:22.220 --> 02:35:24.220

02:35:24.220 --> 02:35:26.220
And make me laugh affect my life

02:35:26.220 --> 02:35:28.220
We can take it easy

02:35:28.220 --> 02:35:30.220
Max will affect me the best

02:35:30.220 --> 02:35:32.220
And if I knock you off you like I would like

02:35:32.220 --> 02:35:34.220
To stay cool and shy

02:35:34.220 --> 02:35:40.220
And I'm just feeling, I'm crying for you

02:35:40.220 --> 02:35:44.220
Don't hesitate when you let me

02:36:44.220 --> 02:37:01.940
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

02:37:01.940 --> 02:37:05.700
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

02:37:05.700 --> 02:37:13.700
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

02:37:13.700 --> 02:37:15.700
Hello, we're back.

02:37:15.700 --> 02:37:20.700
And you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 43.

02:37:20.700 --> 02:37:25.700
And, um, hi Irene, how are you doing?

02:37:25.700 --> 02:37:26.700
Hi, I'm pretty good, how about you?

02:37:26.700 --> 02:37:27.700
I'm pretty good.

02:37:27.700 --> 02:37:28.700
I love your shirt.

02:37:28.700 --> 02:37:29.700
Thank you.

02:37:29.700 --> 02:37:31.700
Did you tell everyone about Rocky?

02:37:31.700 --> 02:37:32.700
What about Rocky?

02:37:32.700 --> 02:37:36.060
about Rocky how it's going to be on May 10th at Davis.

02:37:36.060 --> 02:37:37.740
Well, you have to remember we're an international show,

02:37:37.740 --> 02:37:39.620
but if anybody's local to Sacramento.

02:37:40.220 --> 02:37:43.480
It's going to be at the Campus Cinema at UC Davis,

02:37:43.900 --> 02:37:46.240
Chem Lab 194, that's what it used to be,

02:37:46.240 --> 02:37:47.400
but now it's an actual theater.

02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:51.360
Yeah, we're doing Rocky at midnight on Saturday, May 10th.

02:37:51.860 --> 02:37:53.240
At the theater in Davis?

02:37:53.480 --> 02:37:56.340
Well, actually, no, it's on the campus,

02:37:56.480 --> 02:37:59.280
but they changed the Chem Lab 194 to an actual theater.

02:37:59.280 --> 02:37:59.880
Oh, okay.

02:37:59.940 --> 02:38:00.440
So that's their theater now.

02:38:00.440 --> 02:38:02.100
What building is that, do you know?

02:38:02.100 --> 02:38:10.980
you would know 194 it's the big big Kim by Kim building well it's right by the

02:38:10.980 --> 02:38:18.900
killing building it's like really big it's like across from the silo yeah it's

02:38:18.900 --> 02:38:24.220
where the soccer field is or there were soccer people playing yeah Student

02:38:24.220 --> 02:38:31.180
Union and the Taco Bell I never went to this oh well he would know or not well

02:38:31.180 --> 02:38:36.180
So you know where the student union is, you go basically, I can't remember the directions,

02:38:36.180 --> 02:38:37.180
it's been a while.

02:38:37.180 --> 02:38:39.180
We can give directions later, but if you're interested, email someone.

02:38:39.180 --> 02:38:46.180
You can go like vtor.ucdavis.edu, you can look on the map there.

02:38:46.180 --> 02:38:51.180
Okay, so as I said, it's time for Ask Orange Lounge.

02:38:51.180 --> 02:38:54.180
Yep.

02:38:54.180 --> 02:38:57.180
Ask Orange Lounge, no I'm kidding, I'm not going to sing this.

02:38:57.180 --> 02:38:58.180
Okay.

02:38:58.180 --> 02:38:59.180
Rob, you need to make new theme songs.

02:38:59.180 --> 02:39:00.180
Yeah I know.

02:39:00.180 --> 02:39:03.780
Alright, here we go. First question is from Justin B. and he wants to know,

02:39:03.780 --> 02:39:07.880
will you play some of those cool songs I sent you, like Speed Over Beethoven, Living

02:39:07.880 --> 02:39:11.180
in America, Hungarian Dance No. 5, Mary Blonde, I Love You?

02:39:11.180 --> 02:39:14.980
No! Well, this is the problem.

02:39:14.980 --> 02:39:18.780
While I want to honor that request and, you know, let everybody

02:39:18.780 --> 02:39:22.180
you know, hear, because it's some rare stuff, it's some cool stuff. It's not from SyFam, it's from

02:39:22.180 --> 02:39:24.080
LED Records. I fucked that up earlier.

02:39:24.080 --> 02:39:27.880
But the problem is, when I played that one a little while ago, half the chat room was like

02:39:27.880 --> 02:39:37.880
I'm kind of at a tough space here. So, yes, we'll play them, you know, we'll intermix them with the other stuff, but we can't play them all in one big clump.

02:39:37.880 --> 02:39:49.880
Yeah, Loki says we can play them on February 30th. No, we'll play some after the show. We'll intermix it in with our typical Bamani music. How's that? We'll compromise.

02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:59.880
Because there are some folks out there that like that stuff, which is cool. I like some of it. I don't like all of it, but I like some of it. But there was some good sounding stuff in there. So, we shall soon see.

02:39:59.880 --> 02:40:06.880
Hey Rob? I like kinky sex. Are we going to compromise and allow me to have kinky sex on the show every now and then and mix that into the weekly programming?

02:40:06.880 --> 02:40:10.880
No, we might be able to arrange that. Yeah, it would boost our ratings.

02:40:10.880 --> 02:40:16.880
Let's see, this is a question probably Loki would be best to answer, this one for Loki.

02:40:16.880 --> 02:40:25.880
This is from snubdisnoid and he wants to know, does the PSX DEX drive not work with WinBlows XP or does mine just hate me?

02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:28.880
Yours just hates you because I have Windows XP and mine works fine.

02:40:28.880 --> 02:40:31.880
Here's what I do though, I don't use the stupid program that comes with it.

02:40:31.880 --> 02:40:33.880
I use a program called, uh...

02:40:33.880 --> 02:40:37.880
Fuck, I can't remember the name.

02:40:37.880 --> 02:40:40.880
Okay, I use a program called...

02:40:40.880 --> 02:40:43.880
Called My Screensaver's On And Now My Computer Isn't Responding.

02:40:43.880 --> 02:40:46.880
Hold on. It's called, uh...

02:40:46.880 --> 02:40:49.880
PSX Game Edit.

02:40:49.880 --> 02:40:52.880
Or, yeah, Game Edit. PSX Game Edit.

02:40:52.880 --> 02:40:56.880
And it's a nice little program that you can use for copying your edits and stuff, and it works fine.

02:40:56.880 --> 02:40:59.880
I mean, trust me, this thing works on my freaking laptop.

02:40:59.880 --> 02:41:05.840
it sucks ass okay it'll work on anything if it doesn't work on XP do not use XP

02:41:05.840 --> 02:41:09.840
drivers that XP tells you will work go to their website and download a driver

02:41:09.840 --> 02:41:17.500
off their site that might be the problem as well you have a question well go

02:41:17.500 --> 02:41:21.520
ahead why not we'll get to theirs eventually my question is for you or Matt

02:41:21.520 --> 02:41:26.140
or Jamie who's not here okay are you guys ever gonna do the covers in classic

02:41:26.140 --> 02:41:28.820
show and or a request show

02:41:28.820 --> 02:41:31.960
a covers and classic show request like a music show

02:41:31.960 --> 02:41:34.860
yellow like even like non-bamani

02:41:34.860 --> 02:41:38.740
well this was interesting is with with may coming one hour into may and you

02:41:38.740 --> 02:41:42.740
know it's may sweeps in radio and tv land as we call it where you know

02:41:42.740 --> 02:41:45.700
well not just a good amount of tomorrow but you know we have a sweeps going on

02:41:45.700 --> 02:41:47.200
right now that's when your favorite

02:41:47.200 --> 02:41:50.520
your favorite when your favorite characters get married on t-v shows that

02:41:50.520 --> 02:41:52.540
people leave and shows go off the air

02:41:52.540 --> 02:41:54.940
so what we do is still you were have season three

02:41:54.940 --> 02:41:58.060
One other thing I want to do on top of that is add some more music programming.

02:41:58.060 --> 02:42:01.820
We have the long version lunches and late nights that are coming soon to the station,

02:42:01.820 --> 02:42:05.400
which have been coming soon for like three months, but anyway.

02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:09.140
Some other things I'd like to do is maybe have like a cover show, like a classic show

02:42:09.140 --> 02:42:10.140
like an 80s.

02:42:10.140 --> 02:42:14.340
Well, the thing is that I don't want to compete with anything that Understation Live does

02:42:14.340 --> 02:42:19.480
because they're kind of the birthplace of this, and they have an 80s show now on understationlive.org,

02:42:19.480 --> 02:42:24.740
so it would be more of a like classic show, like not just 80s but like early 90s dance

02:42:24.740 --> 02:42:27.580
and more dance songs, not goth-y songs yet.

02:42:27.580 --> 02:42:32.820
The songs that they covered in DDR, it's just that, it doesn't have to be strictly 80s.

02:42:32.820 --> 02:42:34.340
Or like a request show, like I said.

02:42:34.340 --> 02:42:38.020
I would like to see that happen, and of course the request shows are kind of already happening

02:42:38.020 --> 02:42:41.620
because we do have the live fuck-offs that go on on the station, but they're not scheduled,

02:42:41.620 --> 02:42:42.620
that's not a problem.

02:42:42.620 --> 02:42:45.580
Yeah, I mean like an actual 6.30 or 9.30 Sunday request show.

02:42:45.580 --> 02:42:50.780
It's possible, but it just depends, the problem is, Loki, myself, Dark Sacro, we dedicate

02:42:50.780 --> 02:42:52.740
a lot of time to the station as it is.

02:42:52.740 --> 02:42:56.660
And I think while we're willing to dedicate more, certainly it's kind of hard for us to

02:42:56.660 --> 02:43:01.460
sit there and go like, okay, I'm going to do it Tuesday at six, you know, it's kind

02:43:01.460 --> 02:43:02.460
of hard to take away.

02:43:02.460 --> 02:43:05.820
Well, I mean, like an actual, on a Sunday, you know, like an actual official show for

02:43:05.820 --> 02:43:08.180
a question, as opposed to a fuck off, but...

02:43:08.180 --> 02:43:09.180
Possibly, possibly.

02:43:09.180 --> 02:43:10.180
Don't you have an intern?

02:43:10.180 --> 02:43:11.180
Yeah, we do have an intern.

02:43:11.180 --> 02:43:13.660
Yes, and certainly, certainly you can.

02:43:13.660 --> 02:43:15.780
And we have other people that want to go live on our station, too.

02:43:15.780 --> 02:43:21.460
We just have to figure out how to work all that out fairly without taking away from the

02:43:21.460 --> 02:43:22.460
rest of Orange Lounge.

02:43:22.460 --> 02:43:26.260
not turning it into a egothon, I guess I should say

02:43:26.260 --> 02:43:29.660
because then everybody, you know, if one person we let one audience member go live

02:43:29.660 --> 02:43:30.940
then everybody's going to want to go live

02:43:30.940 --> 02:43:34.620
so we have to find a way to figure out to do a fair while it still holds the

02:43:34.620 --> 02:43:38.540
high quality of Orange Lawn's radio and all that stuff. So, we'll figure it out.

02:43:38.540 --> 02:43:42.060
I was just talking to Anita and I reminded myself of another fuck you I have to have, alright?

02:43:42.060 --> 02:43:45.260
Alright, go for it. This is fuck you to my parents, alright?

02:43:45.260 --> 02:43:48.340
And my family for that matter. You know,

02:43:48.340 --> 02:43:52.280
I've only known, like, Anita for like three weeks. Stop asking me is she

02:43:52.280 --> 02:43:57.160
marriage material? Is she going to have kids? Does she want to have kids? Those are good

02:43:57.160 --> 02:44:02.640
birthing kids. Those are good birthing kids. That's another thing. My ex keeps emailing

02:44:02.640 --> 02:44:06.800
me and she keeps asking me the same question. Are you going to marry Nellie again? Marry

02:44:06.800 --> 02:44:11.520
her? Just because you broke up with me and got married like a couple weeks later doesn't

02:44:11.520 --> 02:44:14.740
mean that I'm going to go out and get married right away. Just because you're a freaking

02:44:14.740 --> 02:44:22.160
Jesus freak, okay, and have to have some commitment issues, and are living in Chico. When you're

02:44:22.160 --> 02:44:28.160
Your potential is a, um, pet, what was it, it's a veterinarian secretary.

02:44:28.160 --> 02:44:29.160
Yeah.

02:44:29.160 --> 02:44:37.360
Yeah, so that fuck you is for you mom and Eugene and you Aunt Mickey and you Uncle Zach.

02:44:37.360 --> 02:44:38.360
Fuck all of you.

02:44:38.360 --> 02:44:41.480
Happy Mother's Day from Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:41.480 --> 02:44:42.800
Alright, moving on.

02:44:42.800 --> 02:44:43.800
Okay.

02:44:43.800 --> 02:44:45.800
Oh, you had another question I heard?

02:44:45.800 --> 02:44:46.800
No.

02:44:46.800 --> 02:44:47.800
Alright.

02:44:47.800 --> 02:44:48.800
I'm just taking the mic.

02:44:48.800 --> 02:44:49.800
Let's move on then, shall we?

02:44:49.800 --> 02:44:50.800
Okay.

02:44:50.800 --> 02:45:01.040
The next question is, Dark Tetsuya would like to know, will you ever get around to adding

02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:04.040
more Vanessa Mae, speaking of which?

02:45:04.040 --> 02:45:07.880
The only problem with adding more Vanessa Mae is that she hasn't really done anything

02:45:07.880 --> 02:45:15.240
else, Dance Mania, things like that, except for a really, really horrible track of Vanessa

02:45:15.240 --> 02:45:19.960
Mae, which I think appears on Dance Mania 7, but even Dark Tetsuya, the complete Vanessa

02:45:19.960 --> 02:45:24.960
that song is of the suck, and it will never be played again on Orange Island Radio.

02:45:24.960 --> 02:45:30.960
But we do have some random stuff that appears, I don't see why we can't add one or two more of Vanessa May songs, just because she rocks.

02:45:30.960 --> 02:45:38.960
But I gotta find something more techno-y, upbeat that fits into the groove of the rest of the station.

02:45:38.960 --> 02:45:43.960
Something like, there's a song called White Bird that's remixed by Airscape, that's pretty good.

02:45:43.960 --> 02:45:45.960
And Airscape is actually Bamani related too.

02:45:45.960 --> 02:45:47.960
White Bird's pretty good, so I might add that.

02:45:47.960 --> 02:45:53.960
But as far as, like, it's gotta be something dancy. If you have some dancy Vanessa May songs, certainly Sennen will think about adding them.

02:45:53.960 --> 02:45:59.960
But there is some good- and she does have that Cotton Eye Joe, and that does relate to Bamani in a roundabout way, so...

02:45:59.960 --> 02:46:05.960
But, uh, for the time being, I think it's just gonna be a fuck-offs, and then we'll try to get at least one more Vanessa May track.

02:46:05.960 --> 02:46:12.960
Because I know Fantasia's getting a little stale, but you know what you need to do? You need to write Vanessa May and tell her to let herself appear on more Transmedia albums.

02:46:12.960 --> 02:46:16.960
Or you could just say, oh wait, Vanessa Mae sucks and I don't really give a shit about her.

02:46:16.960 --> 02:46:17.960
Oh, shut up.

02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:20.960
Or you could write her and tell her to stop making crap music.

02:46:20.960 --> 02:46:22.960
You guys are awful.

02:46:22.960 --> 02:46:23.960
Vanessa Mae's a piece of shit.

02:46:23.960 --> 02:46:28.960
And guess what? We just, we just net split. Our chat rooms are going through a net split right now.

02:46:28.960 --> 02:46:30.960
Don't split. Don't split.

02:46:30.960 --> 02:46:37.960
If you're on the other side of the net split, you guys can email your questions right now too. I'll keep an eye on the email box, okay?

02:46:37.960 --> 02:46:41.480
email your questions to orange lounge radio that's all one word

02:46:41.480 --> 02:46:44.760
orange lounge radio at yahoo.com. A net split is when

02:46:44.760 --> 02:46:48.480
the servers, one of the servers, like a chat room

02:46:48.480 --> 02:46:52.100
has like 10 different servers all funneling into the chat room. That's when like half

02:46:52.100 --> 02:46:53.400
those servers break off.

02:46:53.400 --> 02:46:56.660
Like they stop talking to each other, they crash. Even one server can break off

02:46:56.660 --> 02:47:00.660
the link between a bunch of the servers. Exactly. And that causes a bunch of the other people to

02:47:00.660 --> 02:47:04.680
suddenly look like they quit but they didn't quit. They're still online but they're on some

02:47:04.680 --> 02:47:07.040
other servers so you lost the link between a bunch of those people.

02:47:07.040 --> 02:47:11.040
And I'm sure people who are listening right now understand that already, but this is for people who didn't understand.

02:47:11.040 --> 02:47:12.040
You never know.

02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:13.040
You never know.

02:47:13.040 --> 02:47:16.040
We have some people who are new to our chat room who may not understand the next play.

02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:18.040
We get new people on our chat room every week. Hello to you.

02:47:18.040 --> 02:47:24.040
And if you want to join our chat room, just head on over to calibomani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on Chat.

02:47:24.040 --> 02:47:25.040
That was a very nice segue, Rob.

02:47:25.040 --> 02:47:28.040
Thank you.

02:47:28.040 --> 02:47:30.040
Matt's going to give us some news, right?

02:47:30.040 --> 02:47:31.040
Give us some news about your site.

02:47:31.040 --> 02:47:37.040
Before you do that, I think you should post a link to your site somewhere, like on the Cali Bamani site, because I couldn't find your site.

02:48:01.040 --> 02:48:05.040
Yes, I actually purchased forums and I will have forums soon.

02:48:05.040 --> 02:48:08.040
I just have to scan them and then we're ready to go.

02:48:08.040 --> 02:48:09.040
Has to give them some clothes.

02:48:09.040 --> 02:48:10.040
Yes.

02:48:10.040 --> 02:48:11.040
All right.

02:48:11.040 --> 02:48:12.040
So.

02:48:12.040 --> 02:48:19.040
Good question coming to us from Akuma GM who is getting us to talk about some Bomani.

02:48:19.040 --> 02:48:25.040
Will the release of DDRXBox produce some enjoyable downloadable content?

02:48:25.040 --> 02:48:26.040
Interesting question.

02:48:26.040 --> 02:48:27.040
Loki says yes.

02:48:27.040 --> 02:48:29.040
I didn't know there was going to be a DDRXBox.

02:48:29.040 --> 02:48:31.040
You need to listen to this show more often, Brad.

02:48:31.040 --> 02:48:33.040
Fuck you! What is this show?

02:48:33.040 --> 02:48:35.040
Content, yes, enjoyable, no.

02:48:35.040 --> 02:48:40.040
Alright, fuck you, Xbox. Fuck you, listener or chat person for mentioning the Xbox.

02:48:40.040 --> 02:48:47.040
Xbox sucks. The only game you should ever buy on Xbox, other than Dead or Alive beach volleyball just for the jiggliness,

02:48:47.040 --> 02:48:52.040
or Outlaw Volleyball for the jiggliness, is Psychonauts because my friend is making that game and it's gonna be badass.

02:48:52.040 --> 02:48:58.040
But other than that, Xbox sucks. It makes a better Linux machine, and they finally hacked it with Linux without putting a mod chip in.

02:48:58.040 --> 02:48:59.040
chip in.

02:48:59.040 --> 02:49:03.560
Okay, before we continue, because I'm going to play devil's advocate here. We all know

02:49:03.560 --> 02:49:07.680
the console war will never end. I personally don't hate, or I personally don't like Xbox,

02:49:07.680 --> 02:49:09.880
but I don't want to piss off a bunch of people by saying that.

02:49:09.880 --> 02:49:13.240
I saw more Xbox propaganda this morning on G4. They did this Xbox propaganda thing on

02:49:13.240 --> 02:49:18.440
G4 this morning, talking about how, like, it's so great and everything, and how it's...

02:49:18.440 --> 02:49:19.440
No.

02:49:19.440 --> 02:49:20.440
Oh, horrible.

02:49:20.440 --> 02:49:26.520
Darkchild, I agree. I'm not a big fan of Xbox, but the problem is we are a Bimani talk show,

02:49:26.520 --> 02:49:30.520
and whether we like it or not, they're putting Bomani on the Xbox, so we kind of have to talk about it.

02:49:30.520 --> 02:49:32.520
But what about...

02:49:32.520 --> 02:49:38.520
To quote Ryan, Xbox would be better served as a weapon to hit 10-year-old children with.

02:49:38.520 --> 02:49:45.520
It's more like a depth charge thing, man. That thing is heavy, and it will destroy any underwater vessel.

02:49:45.520 --> 02:49:51.520
It was going to be called the Direct Xbox, because the Direct X team was working on it, and that's why it's called the Xbox.

02:49:51.520 --> 02:49:55.520
Really, I think they called the Xbox because it's the size of a box and has an X on it.

02:49:55.520 --> 02:50:12.520
Here's an idea, Konami, let's all write letters to Konami, instead of wasting your production time to make stupid Xbox ports of Bimani games, why don't you put your time into making 7th style for home PS2 so we can have 2DX at home again?

02:50:12.520 --> 02:50:17.520
No, I don't care if it's US or Japanese, I want more 2DX at home.

02:50:17.520 --> 02:50:24.520
Okay, this is the problem. This is the problem. Yes, DDRXBox will have enjoyable downloadable content.

02:50:24.520 --> 02:50:29.520
And in fact, I predict DDRXBox is going to be the best fucking DDR game they've done yet.

02:50:29.520 --> 02:50:33.520
Do you know why? Because we're all sitting here bitching about how we're not going to buy it and support the Xbox.

02:50:33.520 --> 02:50:35.520
And that's the way God works.

02:50:35.520 --> 02:50:44.520
It will probably have enjoyable downloadable content at the price of $50 a month in addition to your normal cost of the game for Xbox Live.

02:50:44.520 --> 02:50:51.520
xbox live is fifty dollars

02:50:51.580 --> 02:50:55.120
i mean uh... it's gonna cost me fifteen dollars monthly request to i'm not going

02:50:55.120 --> 02:50:57.980
to pay fifty dollars for what xbox live

02:50:57.980 --> 02:51:00.760
all we're going to do is make it either the eyes of the few days

02:51:00.760 --> 02:51:04.320
speaking of which in less someone beats me to it i'm making the deal

02:51:04.320 --> 02:51:07.600
you w eyes for the uh... maxed exclusive songs

02:51:07.600 --> 02:51:11.120
uh... will be coming up right because you know i'm really shocked those

02:51:11.120 --> 02:51:12.380
haven't already been done

02:51:12.380 --> 02:51:15.380
People are just being lazy, actually, and haven't gotten their game or just don't care.

02:51:15.380 --> 02:51:17.880
I can make mine in, like, a couple hours.

02:51:17.880 --> 02:51:18.380
Do it!

02:51:18.380 --> 02:51:20.380
I could make them the night if I wanted to.

02:51:20.880 --> 02:51:22.880
The question is, do I want to?

02:51:22.880 --> 02:51:23.880
Okay.

02:51:24.380 --> 02:51:29.380
The next question is from SoCalKicks, and I accidentally closed his window, but I sort of remember what it said.

02:51:29.380 --> 02:51:30.880
Oh, I remember that guy a long time ago.

02:51:30.880 --> 02:51:33.880
Yeah, I know, he has disappeared, but he actually asked a question.

02:51:33.880 --> 02:51:38.880
SoCalKicks, for those who may not remember SoCalKicks, let me play a little something.

02:51:38.880 --> 02:51:44.380
a bigger mall than we do and it's cooler and they have a Dave and Buster's there and they

02:51:44.380 --> 02:51:50.540
have a guy that gets massages in the mall and it was awesome.

02:51:50.540 --> 02:51:53.540
For those of you that forget SoCal Kicks, here's a little reminder.

02:51:53.540 --> 02:52:01.700
Hi everybody, this is DSDS, make sure to visit SoCalKicks.com and you're listening to Orange

02:52:01.700 --> 02:52:02.700
Lounge Radio.

02:52:02.700 --> 02:52:05.900
We finally accomplished ultimate evolution just now.

02:52:05.900 --> 02:52:10.900
You know how many times I had to get him to say his own little motto for his website?

02:52:10.900 --> 02:52:13.900
Twice. Anyway.

02:52:13.900 --> 02:52:22.900
He wants to know, why is it that I'm not listening to this station anymore, even though I have an urge to?

02:52:22.900 --> 02:52:27.900
Because SoCal kicks, you suck.

02:52:27.900 --> 02:52:29.900
I don't know about that, he seemed like a pretty cool guy.

02:52:29.900 --> 02:52:32.900
I say he's just discovered the joys of masturbation.

02:52:32.900 --> 02:52:36.900
Oh, this is spending a lot more time with Rosie Palmer and her five sisters?

02:52:36.900 --> 02:52:38.900
I hope the window's not open still, is it?

02:52:38.900 --> 02:52:45.900
That is no excuse whatsoever, if you're listening to the radio. I mean, that requires no hands at all.

02:52:45.900 --> 02:52:55.900
Even if you're one-handed to Live365.com, you one-hand click orange clouds, one-click to play, and then your hands pre.

02:52:55.900 --> 02:52:59.900
But you can even put Flash videos up and watch those at the same time.

02:52:59.900 --> 02:53:04.300
I think we got a new sweeper here with Darkchild. Come on, man.

02:53:04.300 --> 02:53:09.420
Man, you could probably play step mania and beat off at the same time.

02:53:09.420 --> 02:53:14.740
It seems possible. I mean, you could probably beat off and play five-key beat mania too.

02:53:14.740 --> 02:53:18.780
Seven-key's a little hard to one-hand. He's playing five-key beat mania with his penis.

02:53:18.780 --> 02:53:22.700
Yeah, with that one ear, Dark.

02:53:22.700 --> 02:53:24.940
That was playing one-handed.

02:53:24.940 --> 02:53:29.940
That's that song you played, the DWI was like, how long, 45 minutes?

02:53:29.940 --> 02:53:34.940
Yeah, that made your hand more tired than masturbating, I'm sure.

02:53:34.940 --> 02:53:36.940
It's a workout for my right hand.

02:53:36.940 --> 02:53:44.940
I did also perfect combo the beauty of silence one-handed, so...

02:53:44.940 --> 02:53:46.940
The beauty of...

02:53:46.940 --> 02:53:50.940
I will combo the skin flute one-handed.

02:53:50.940 --> 02:53:53.940
Oh, Flute Man, I mean. That's the song.

02:53:53.940 --> 02:54:00.940
Anyway, moving right along. I'm waiting to get yelled at for that answer, but since he's not listening, he won't hear it unless somebody communicates it to him.

02:54:00.940 --> 02:54:03.940
And right now he's probably getting 20 messages from Tattletales going,

02:54:03.940 --> 02:54:06.940
They're teasing you about masturbation, haha!

02:54:06.940 --> 02:54:08.940
Where's he from again? He's from Fremont?

02:54:08.940 --> 02:54:10.940
Hence the name SoCalKicks.

02:54:10.940 --> 02:54:13.940
SoCalKicks means he's from, you know, Hawaii.

02:54:13.940 --> 02:54:16.940
I thought he was in Amsterdam or something, you dumbass.

02:54:16.940 --> 02:54:22.940
Is he part of like Team Changeland? Because I mean, they could teach him how to masturbate properly while he sits on the radio.

02:54:22.940 --> 02:54:26.940
In fact, don't they have a radio show there?

02:54:26.940 --> 02:54:29.940
Who knows? Nobody listens.

02:54:29.940 --> 02:54:31.940
That's okay, nobody listens to this either.

02:54:31.940 --> 02:54:34.940
More than them. Oh, anyway.

02:54:34.940 --> 02:54:35.940
Be nice.

02:54:35.940 --> 02:54:37.940
Oh, I'll be nice.

02:54:37.940 --> 02:54:41.940
Oh, new question. Yes, listen. New question. Here we go.

02:54:41.940 --> 02:54:47.940
John Fields wants to know, psychology or ethnic conflicts of the 20th century?

02:54:47.940 --> 02:54:49.940
Which category for Jeopardy? No.

02:54:49.940 --> 02:54:53.860
Which essay should I start next?

02:54:53.860 --> 02:54:59.700
Psychology or ethnic conflicts of the 20th century?

02:54:59.700 --> 02:55:06.700
I say do the ethnic whatever because you're going to rack your brain on that shit and

02:55:06.700 --> 02:55:10.860
then you could actually use some of the lemons you'll have in your psychology paper.

02:55:10.860 --> 02:55:11.860
I agree.

02:55:11.860 --> 02:55:16.060
I think since psychology sounds like the easier one, do that second so that you coast down

02:55:16.060 --> 02:55:17.060
through the second paper.

02:55:17.060 --> 02:55:22.060
I say plagiarize a Dr. Phil episode, and there you go.

02:55:22.060 --> 02:55:23.060
I say do the psychology.

02:55:23.060 --> 02:55:25.460
If you're going to put all that work into it, at least learn how to fuck with people's

02:55:25.460 --> 02:55:26.460
heads.

02:55:26.460 --> 02:55:29.940
Wait a minute, what were the two topics again?

02:55:29.940 --> 02:55:33.020
Psychology or ethnic conflicts of the 20th century.

02:55:33.020 --> 02:55:37.660
Why not do a psychology paper about the ethnic conflicts of the 20th century and then print

02:55:37.660 --> 02:55:39.660
it out twice and turn it into both classes?

02:55:39.660 --> 02:55:41.160
Beautiful, there you go.

02:55:41.160 --> 02:55:42.160
There's your answer.

02:55:42.160 --> 02:55:43.160
All right.

02:55:43.160 --> 02:55:46.820
Do the system again.

02:55:46.820 --> 02:55:53.820
Ddarrangel has a question for Loki.

02:55:53.820 --> 02:55:54.820
Will you marry me?

02:55:54.820 --> 02:55:57.160
No, just kidding.

02:55:57.160 --> 02:55:59.540
That question's reserved for someone else in our chat room.

02:55:59.540 --> 02:56:00.540
We won't talk about that.

02:56:00.540 --> 02:56:01.540
I'm just kidding.

02:56:01.540 --> 02:56:03.540
Oh god, I'm so gonna get smacked.

02:56:03.540 --> 02:56:08.540
I'm like just waiting for the buffer to get there.

02:56:08.540 --> 02:56:09.540
What?

02:56:09.540 --> 02:56:10.540
Okay.

02:56:10.540 --> 02:56:11.540
Nevermind.

02:56:11.540 --> 02:56:14.340
Anyway, here's the real question.

02:56:14.340 --> 02:56:18.540
Oh, there, I just got smacked.

02:56:18.540 --> 02:56:20.440
When are you going to get to do a fuck off?

02:56:20.440 --> 02:56:22.340
We need your mixed masteness.

02:56:22.340 --> 02:56:31.340
Well, let's see here. First off, I need to get broadband hooked up to my computer. Since it doesn't seem to be happening at the moment, uh, it's not for a while. I don't know.

02:56:31.340 --> 02:56:45.340
Eventually. It is something that will be coming to- in fact, we're hoping- this goes back to Irene's question earlier. Hopefully, Loki will be doing a regular show. Like, it'll be like every week at a certain time, right?

02:56:45.340 --> 02:56:56.340
Yeah, there was going to be a mix show, but you know, there's kind of a couple problems with that. First off, I don't know how to mix. So we need to kind of figure that one out first.

02:56:56.340 --> 02:57:02.340
I can almost be matched. Maybe you could fix that almost part and then you could do it.

02:57:02.340 --> 02:57:08.340
I can do it. I honestly have to go through all my records and mark down what the BPM is on and all of them.

02:57:08.340 --> 02:57:13.340
And then I have to listen to all of them numerous times, which is gonna be a bitch.

02:57:13.340 --> 02:57:19.340
So I know what songs sound the same, beat-wise and bass-wise, so I can mix them together.

02:57:23.340 --> 02:57:27.340
And you already know about doing the filter out to just the bass track and the drum track onto it, right?

02:57:27.340 --> 02:57:31.340
I'm gonna get through these last couple questions before we have to end the show here.

02:57:31.340 --> 02:57:35.340
Ah, return of a classic. This question's for Bradley.

02:57:35.340 --> 02:57:39.340
This question's been asked to a lot of people on the show, but 23rd Magus wants to know,

02:57:39.340 --> 02:57:43.340
Bradley, what would you do with two quiet Jap girls,

02:57:43.340 --> 02:57:47.340
a bucket of Choco Ready Whip, a cake pie, and a 2DX controller?

02:57:47.340 --> 02:57:51.340
Our child wants to answer this, too.

02:57:51.340 --> 02:57:55.340
I'd probably go crazy and not know what to do.

02:57:55.340 --> 02:57:59.340
I'd just sit in the corner and watch them play 2DX.

02:57:59.340 --> 02:58:04.980
And film the whole thing, and tell them to do crazy stuff.

02:58:04.980 --> 02:58:06.660
It was chocolate ready whip?

02:58:06.660 --> 02:58:08.820
I play beat mania while eating chocolate ready whip.

02:58:08.820 --> 02:58:10.580
That's a good thing, dude.

02:58:10.580 --> 02:58:14.700
Dude, you got it!

02:58:14.700 --> 02:58:23.220
No, no, I play beat mania.

02:58:23.220 --> 02:58:25.220
I get it.

02:58:25.220 --> 02:58:33.220
First, I'd set the video camera, because obviously any situation with that there would have to be a video camera in the room.

02:58:33.220 --> 02:58:35.220
And I'd link to the website with it broadcasting.

02:58:35.220 --> 02:58:42.220
Oh, definitely, in our broadcast. Let's see here, Kawaii Japanese Girls, so impressionable, and with ready whip.

02:58:42.220 --> 02:58:44.220
Are they in schoolgirl uniforms?

02:58:44.220 --> 02:58:47.220
No, see, they have to be regular ready whip, because I don't like chocolate that much.

02:58:47.220 --> 02:58:49.220
This is a question for Bradley, guys, come on.

02:58:49.220 --> 02:58:54.800
This brings up a fuck you to people who use some Japanese words in English, like kawaii

02:58:54.800 --> 02:58:55.800
girls.

02:58:55.800 --> 02:59:01.920
That's really, really fucking annoying, especially in, I get Raijin magazine, and they have like

02:59:01.920 --> 02:59:05.400
the game and anime thing, and then they bring it out somewhere out of nowhere.

02:59:05.400 --> 02:59:07.400
This game is really kawaii.

02:59:07.400 --> 02:59:08.400
Know what I hate?

02:59:08.400 --> 02:59:14.040
Know what I hate is when people mispronounce anime and spell it wrong when they email me

02:59:14.040 --> 02:59:16.000
at work asking me questions about anime.

02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:17.520
I want to know about the anima.

02:59:17.520 --> 02:59:21.320
I want to know about the enemy.

02:59:21.320 --> 02:59:27.320
I want to know about the Japanem- I can't even pronounce how they say it.

02:59:27.320 --> 02:59:29.740
It's like the Japanimation.

02:59:29.740 --> 02:59:30.740
Just write them back.

02:59:30.740 --> 02:59:35.760
The enema is up your ass, and you are the enemy.

02:59:35.760 --> 02:59:36.760
Japanenem conation?

02:59:36.760 --> 02:59:37.760
I don't know.

02:59:37.760 --> 02:59:38.760
Anyway.

02:59:38.760 --> 02:59:39.760
They're like Japanime.

02:59:39.760 --> 02:59:40.760
I like that.

02:59:40.760 --> 02:59:41.760
Japanime.

02:59:41.760 --> 02:59:42.760
Okay.

02:59:42.760 --> 02:59:43.760
Here we go.

02:59:43.760 --> 02:59:44.760
Japanime!

02:59:44.760 --> 02:59:45.760
Okay.

02:59:45.760 --> 02:59:46.760
Here we go.

02:59:46.760 --> 02:59:49.760
Dartitsuyu would like to know, have you ever played Parodius?

02:59:49.760 --> 02:59:53.480
Gogucho, Sexy, et cetera, um, anybody, I guess.

02:59:53.480 --> 02:59:57.480
He didn't direct it towards any particular person.

02:59:57.480 --> 02:59:58.480
Yeah, I've played it.

02:59:58.480 --> 02:59:59.480
Look, he said he tried.

02:59:59.480 --> 03:00:02.480
I have, uh, like, two or three of the games on Saturn, so I've played it so fine.

03:00:02.480 --> 03:00:03.480
I'll play it right now.

03:00:03.480 --> 03:00:04.480
I have played Parodius.

03:00:04.480 --> 03:00:05.480
And it sucks.

03:00:05.480 --> 03:00:06.480
Play Gradius.

03:00:06.480 --> 03:00:07.480
God.

03:00:07.480 --> 03:00:09.880
Um, I've played it for a little bit on Nintendo emulator.

03:00:09.880 --> 03:00:11.160
Oh, come on.

03:00:11.160 --> 03:00:12.160
Don't play Gradius.

03:00:12.160 --> 03:00:13.160
Play Life Force.

03:00:13.160 --> 03:00:19.160
Do you know what I love most about Parodius as the penguins?

03:00:19.160 --> 03:00:27.160
I don't know, I think Gradius is still the classic Konami shooter.

03:00:27.160 --> 03:00:30.160
It's got burning heat in it, Gradius 2.

03:00:30.160 --> 03:00:57.160
UK Bondage Boy wanted to back up something that Bradley had said in the last bit about Japan English.

03:00:57.160 --> 03:00:59.920
It's like having the screen name Nico Bubblegum.

03:00:59.920 --> 03:01:03.240
Yes, let's be multicultural and trendy.

03:01:03.240 --> 03:01:06.960
Okay, Ralph.

03:01:06.960 --> 03:01:12.000
Okay, last question. Last question for Ask Orange Lounge. Sorry everybody.

03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:15.160
The last question is from Justin B. He wants to know

03:01:15.160 --> 03:01:19.080
when will this show ever end? The answer is right now.

03:01:19.080 --> 03:01:22.280
Let's go around to get everybody's final thoughts.

03:01:22.280 --> 03:01:25.360
Final thought.

03:01:25.360 --> 03:01:31.840
I know way too much things about my mother that I wish I never knew or heard uttered

03:01:31.840 --> 03:01:32.840
from her mouth.

03:01:32.840 --> 03:01:33.840
La la la la la la la.

03:01:33.840 --> 03:01:34.840
DDR-holic.

03:01:34.840 --> 03:01:41.200
Um, Engrish is very, very nice fun, thank you.

03:01:41.200 --> 03:01:42.840
You wanna go now, Loki, or at the end?

03:01:42.840 --> 03:01:43.840
I don't care, whatever.

03:01:43.840 --> 03:01:44.840
Alright, Loki.

03:01:44.840 --> 03:01:46.840
Oh, I guess I'm going now.

03:01:46.840 --> 03:01:50.080
I can't believe I missed Simpsons, and the TV is right here, but I was watching the most

03:01:50.080 --> 03:01:55.840
six-year-old nation challenges as i said yesterday

03:01:55.840 --> 03:01:59.320
i said like i was going to watch it every week now that i have a t b in cable

03:01:59.320 --> 03:02:00.680
but new

03:02:00.680 --> 03:02:03.040
had to be stupid where

03:02:03.040 --> 03:02:04.920
the wretched evil ice queen

03:02:04.920 --> 03:02:08.720
and haggard

03:02:08.720 --> 03:02:10.480
that's it

03:02:10.480 --> 03:02:11.940
just deep panting

03:02:11.940 --> 03:02:14.760
for the ice cream this is very staker now

03:02:14.760 --> 03:02:18.960
very serious final yes everybody yes brad everybody

03:02:18.960 --> 03:02:22.960
Shh, everybody, this is a serious, very, come on!

03:02:22.960 --> 03:02:24.960
Very serious final thought.

03:02:24.960 --> 03:02:27.960
I don't care if you believe in God or any religion

03:02:27.960 --> 03:02:32.960
or praying at all, everybody please pray to Konami

03:02:32.960 --> 03:02:34.960
that Castlevania for PS2 is going to be a good game.

03:02:34.960 --> 03:02:35.960
And it's not going to suck.

03:02:35.960 --> 03:02:37.960
It is very serious, I am very serious.

03:02:37.960 --> 03:02:38.960
Everybody, please.

03:02:38.960 --> 03:02:39.960
Amen!

03:02:39.960 --> 03:02:42.960
Amen, can I get a witness in here?

03:02:42.960 --> 03:02:43.960
What are you talking about?

03:02:43.960 --> 03:02:46.960
When's the last time Konami's fucked something up?

03:02:46.960 --> 03:02:52.960
Don't get me started. We won't even utter.

03:02:52.960 --> 03:02:56.960
We're not going to mention that name on the radio.

03:02:56.960 --> 03:02:58.960
Rice Princess, final thought.

03:02:58.960 --> 03:03:02.960
What kind of world is this? It's kind of crap. Fight.

03:03:02.960 --> 03:03:04.960
Bradley, final thought.

03:03:04.960 --> 03:03:10.960
Hooray for the random oni course. It's evil and fun all wrapped into one.

03:03:10.960 --> 03:03:12.960
That was poetic.

03:03:12.960 --> 03:03:18.200
I'm sure if Jamie were here her final thought would be Squee or Wee or I Own You or something

03:03:18.200 --> 03:03:24.800
like that or Battle Royale something or Sleep, I Need Sleep or Let's Go Get Tapioca, any

03:03:24.800 --> 03:03:27.040
of the above would be Jamie's final thought, I'm pretty sure.

03:03:27.040 --> 03:03:31.760
I would say with pretty good accuracy I think I got it.

03:03:31.760 --> 03:03:40.360
My final thought is I need sex.

03:03:40.360 --> 03:03:44.040
How much are you willing to pay?

03:03:44.040 --> 03:03:45.040
Never mind.

03:03:45.040 --> 03:03:49.200
I could be whoever you want.

03:03:49.200 --> 03:03:50.520
Can you be Anita?

03:03:50.520 --> 03:03:55.120
Oh, I could sure try.

03:03:55.120 --> 03:04:00.960
I did get really drunk last night and I touched, never mind, we won't go there.

03:04:00.960 --> 03:04:05.600
And it wasn't my boobie?

03:04:05.600 --> 03:04:12.280
Who'd you molest?

03:04:12.280 --> 03:04:14.780
I'm going to get in trouble for saying that on air.

03:04:14.780 --> 03:04:20.100
I'll give the final word of the night to the Ice Queen.

03:04:20.100 --> 03:04:21.960
The haggard wretched Ice Queen.

03:04:21.960 --> 03:04:23.640
The haggard wretched Ice Queen?

03:04:23.640 --> 03:04:24.640
Final word.

03:04:24.640 --> 03:04:25.800
No, one word.

03:04:25.800 --> 03:04:26.800
One word.

03:04:26.800 --> 03:04:27.800
Final word.

03:04:27.800 --> 03:04:28.800
Good.

03:04:28.800 --> 03:04:34.480

Will everyone please rise for the presentation

03:04:57.720 --> 03:05:00.880
of our national colors.

03:05:00.880 --> 03:05:19.880
Oh, I like that! Oh, yeah!

03:05:19.880 --> 03:05:25.880
Come to the place where tropical breezes flow!

03:05:25.880 --> 03:05:30.880
To the coolest place I know

03:05:30.880 --> 03:05:33.880
The people are so great

03:05:33.880 --> 03:05:36.880
But really there's only me

03:05:36.880 --> 03:05:39.880
And that means I'm so great

03:05:39.880 --> 03:05:41.880
And also there's the cheat

03:05:41.880 --> 03:05:43.880
Oh there's the cheat

03:05:43.880 --> 03:05:48.880
In the place where the tropical breezes flow

03:05:48.880 --> 03:05:50.880
The cheat

03:05:50.880 --> 03:05:53.880
In the coolest place I know

03:05:53.880 --> 03:05:59.880
The ones are always cold, and the parties last all night.

03:05:59.880 --> 03:06:06.880
And there's probably lots of chocolate and population tire.

03:06:06.880 --> 03:06:16.880
Population tire!

03:06:16.880 --> 03:06:23.000
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
