1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,080
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

2
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,320
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,080
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,340
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

5
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,540
Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

6
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,340
Just kidding, Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex. In this episode...

7
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:43,040
Hey, are there any balls down there?

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,840
About the biggest bear you've ever seen, Diggleberry.

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,840
What's your favorite scary movie?

10
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,740
Showgirls. Absolutely frightening. What's yours?

11
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,240
There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

12
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,040
Don't torture yourself. That's my job.

13
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,040
Now's the time on sprockets and we dodge!

14
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,040
I don't get you, my pretty!

15
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,540
And your little dog, too!

16
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,040
I know kung-fu.

17
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,540
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

18
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,040
Why did they have to take the word gay?

19
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,040
No! What he expects for Spanish exposition is kendo.

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,040
Hey!

21
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,040
Dark Sakurai.

22
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,040
Shut up!

23
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,040
Where's my gun? This is my boomstick!

24
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,040
Skye.

25
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,040
Come on, girls, it's time to drop the bomb!

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,040
I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex with me.

27
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,040
What kind of war human being would find that funny?

28
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,040
Orange Lounge Radio

29
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,040
We are live, and this is episode number 44 for May the 11th of 2003.

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,040
You're tuned into the Bamani Scene's most sleep deprived radio station of all things Be Money.

31
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,840
Also with us tonight say hello to intern zero. I can't get this fucking cookie out of the package

32
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,480
Like pissing me off. That sounds kind of sexual

33
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,780
Damn it. I'd now like only gonna be able to get that one out

34
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,640
That was great Jamie went and she got the cookie out of the package and then she ate it

35
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,040
That was almost zing worthy

36
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,400
Nice, she got one for me

37
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,000
Redeemed so it's just the four of us here tonight

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
kostjamrh And they're like dark German chocolate, but it doesn't really taste like dark chocolate, between two thin cookies, and it's really good.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
kostjamrh And it tastes good too. Are these people moving?

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
kostjamrh Yeah, our neighbors are moving.

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
kostjamrh Good.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
kostjamrh You don't need neighbors.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
kostjamrh Mr. Rogers isn't around anymore, we don't need neighbors.

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
kostjamrh You're so nice, everyone's so nice here.

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I got his and that thingys.

46
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
This MP3 is two and a half minutes, which for a 2DX song, that's a long-ass time.

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The intro was really long.

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,500
Yeah.

49
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,000
So it was when we go,

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Two and a half minutes?

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Well, then it's a possibility, but it's kind of, you know, we're not saying it's official.

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
We're not saying it's official, but it might be.

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
And if it is official, then we were the first to play it, right?

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So enjoy this. We're going to play this V remix by Naoki.

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And then we'll play something from Taka and something from Naoki.

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And then we'll be back.

57
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Enjoy!

58
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Oh

59
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Love me, you love me

60
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Love me, you love me

61
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You love me

62
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

63
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:30,520
I can say words in reverse, too.

64
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,520
Do it.

65
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:39,640
Mom, God and dog, radar, or that'd be radair.

66
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,840
Race car, right?

67
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,840
Yeah.

68
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,840
Yeah, race car.

69
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,200
Speaking of mom, happy Mother's Day.

70
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,800
Happy Mother's Day, and I didn't let my mom listen to the show.

71
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,800
to all of our mothers out there listening, which hopefully is none of them.

72
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,800
Mom's like, I want to listen to your radio show.

73
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,800
Um, no you don't.

74
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,800
My mom knows I have one, but I think her and my dad made the mistake of listening to about

75
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,800
two minutes of Undersedation Live once.

76
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,800
And not only that, but it was the same night my sister was on too.

77
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,800
And I think it was probably the same time that Travis was giving her the sex quiz.

78
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,800
So needless to say, they won't be listening to any future radio projects I have.

79
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,800
We don't do the sex quiz on this show, though.

80
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,800
No, we don't do the sex quiz on this show, but it's still pretty bad.

81
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,800
You know, it's too bad, though, that we do Rocky on Saturday nights, because we can't listen to Travis and Jenna.

82
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,800
Well, I'm trying to see if they're ever going to rebroadcast their show.

83
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
I know they do. They have new shows. They have spin-off shows now.

84
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,800
They have, like, the 80s show and some club, goth club show that Travis does.

85
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,800
So, oh, yeah, so we'll plug Understation Live, our buddy's over there.

86
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,800
Yeah, goth talk.

87
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,800
Hello.

88
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:54,800
So, Jamie, I know you had some comments on that supposed ninth-style song.

89
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
It's a piece of shit.

90
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,800
If that was Naoki, then it means that Naoki sat on V and farted, and out that came.

91
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,800
I'm sorry.

92
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,800
As much as we bag on Naoki, he's very talented.

93
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,800
And I know he could do much better than that. That is not Naoki.

94
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:18,800
And anyone who thinks that that's Naoki, who actually believes that that's a Naoki remix, needs to get their head examined. Or either that or get it out of the toilet.

95
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
So what are you going to do if it comes out that that's real?

96
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,800
Are you going to have a cry?

97
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,800
No, I'm probably never going to listen to another Naoki remix again because this is all Salva's talent.

98
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,800
We let Paul Eteri remix it and put his name on it.

99
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,800
Oh, maybe that's it. Maybe let Paul Eteri do all the work this time.

100
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,200
this time

101
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,860
i can tell that it's unique

102
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,800
it's special

103
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,600
um...

104
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,440
first of all i was in band music theory and appreciation i start off as a

105
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,240
music major

106
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,880
i have listened to winter so many times it's not even funny

107
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,800
and um... i could tell that the that uh... second half of the song

108
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,020
was completely ripped from winter it was actually you know

109
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,000
unique parts

110
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,640
so that could is the only way i could think that that's a new mix

111
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,880
But Naoki could do better. So much better.

112
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,560
So I don't think that's Naoki.

113
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,660
As like Le More et La Bierte, which is the other song we heard in there, the last

114
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,240
song we heard in that break, which is a good Naoki song. Very good Naoki song.

115
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,380
And in the middle there was Tomorrow Perfume.

116
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,840
Everybody knows that one. From Taka.

117
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,560
That song pissed me off.

118
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,600
Why does that piss you off?

119
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,720
Just because it's difficult. It's a seven.

120
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,600
Have you seen the latest custom non-stop that's in our machine at Scandia? No.

121
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,040
it's sad i mean it's like a really hard decided that one goes in the i'd i'll

122
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,880
give you two guesses

123
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,560
and the first guest are too many and ends with rick

124
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,820
uh...

125
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,400
it

126
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,960
uh... issue let me go but one and i'd be like

127
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,920
seven-star jamie can pass with me

128
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,120
we have no issues on the point

129
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,760
the uh... way to be like ones you almost passed

130
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,360
they come really close

131
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,760
But no, this is the songs that he has in there.

132
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:12,000
Summer Vacation, Tomorrow Perfume, Traces, Xenon, and A.

133
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,080
And you know what's really fucked about that?

134
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,480
You can't change your speeds in the middle of the nonstop

135
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,320
course on 8 style or whatever.

136
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,600
When you're playing 2DX nonstops, you

137
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,680
can't change your speed.

138
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,520
So whatever speed you play Summer Vacation on, like I

139
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,880
play High Speed 3, you have to.

140
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,240
You have to play A on.

141
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:27,560
What are you talking about?

142
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,040
When you just take a hit right after, like right before A,

143
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,000
then everything is like bullet time, just like

144
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,780
i see the keys coming down

145
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,560
yay

146
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,180
you and drugs

147
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,720
you should

148
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,000
i'm just kidding don't do drugs, drugs are bad

149
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,920
drugs are bad

150
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,960
i'm very happy

151
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,160
why are you happy?

152
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,840
because i just had a cookie

153
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,840
you know what that whole drugs thing reminds me of?

154
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,840
omni crash made a song called bemoni song

155
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,840
is that the one that sounds like the sunscreen song?

156
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,840
yeah here we go

157
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,840
clip don't play the whole thing please

158
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,840
it is short but you gotta play the best part in the middle right after 100 seconds

159
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:30,840
Oh, sorry. That's just me, though. No, I don't know. That song is so funny, especially when it talks about jokes.

160
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,840
I want to hear the whole thing.

161
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,840
You'll like it, but he can't say D-W-I. He says D-W-I.

162
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,840
D-W-I.

163
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,840
Okay, what we'll do to make this interesting is we'll let Loki play the whole song, and we'll make live commentary.

164
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,840
It's just, like, funny content. I'm going to download it again.

165
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,840
Alright, Logie's gonna find that, so we'll broadcast that to you in a little bit.

166
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,840
What else is new? Any other Mother's Day thing? What did you guys do for Mother's Day today? Did you call your mom?

167
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,840
I called my mom on my cell phone driving into his house.

168
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,840
Driving into my house?

169
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:07,840
I was turning to go down the street to your house and I was on the phone with my mom and I had to hang up with her.

170
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:12,840
Because I'm not... I prefer not to be retarded and drive and talk on my cell phone.

171
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,840
Because I would likely...

172
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:19,840
I know you do it, and I still think it's retarded, okay?

173
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:25,840
I tried to call my mom. She didn't answer her phone. I don't think she wants to hear from me today.

174
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,840
But we only talk like once a month, so I mean-

175
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,840
Are those your neighbors that I hate?

176
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,840
No.

177
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,840
The ones upstairs?

178
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,840
No, the ones downstairs.

179
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,840
Oh, poo. I wish the ones that I hate would move.

180
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,840
I can go kick their door in. No, I'm just kidding.

181
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,840
The ones that I hate?

182
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,840
Yeah, when we met them, they were nice.

183
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,840
The people over there?

184
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,840
Up here.

185
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,840
Yeah, they were.

186
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,840
anime is better than sex

187
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,840
I hate this political crap.

188
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,840
Can you hear the song?

189
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,840
Hold on, hold on.

190
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,840
Wait, ah, what's this say?

191
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,840
George W. Lazardo, it really does say that. That's sad.

192
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,840
Alright, let's hear the song.

193
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,840
There you go.

194
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,840
Loading, loading.

195
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,840
This is the Bimani Sims song.

196
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,840
Can you hear that below?

197
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,840
Bimani Rulers V was not the greatest DLOI ever.

198
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,840
Neither is his A.

199
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,840
We're going to do it again.

200
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,340
sped up with different sound effects.

201
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,340
Pretty much, yeah.

202
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:48,840
Kevin is not actually a 57 metallic gray.

203
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,840
That's debatable.

204
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,840
Ever notice how all the best deal of the wise

205
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,840
were made in a notepad, not set mania editor?

206
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,840
How would you know?

207
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,840
Kevin is only as cheesy as he wants to be.

208
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,840
I don't, I don't, I don't.

209
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,840
We need more LEDs-

210
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,840
That was dumb.

211
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,840
Last message for you.

212
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,840
Paranoia Survivor and Paranoia Survivor Max are the same song.

213
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,840
Thank you, yes.

214
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,840
Stop DWIing Sakura.

215
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:24,840
Anyone with a name like Dynamite Rave 68246 Ani is not to be trusted.

216
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,840
Okay, yeah, huh?

217
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,840
All the things she said has been done.

218
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,840
I don't care! It's a great song.

219
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,840
All the things she didn't say.

220
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,840
My next two DWIs involve poltergeists and pants.

221
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,040
X-step is the antichrist.

222
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,240
Bemani style owns me, yes it's true.

223
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,560
At least 100 seconds is enough time for me to get a sandwich.

224
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,680
Moogle Hunter is on speed on possibly

225
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,960
every other drug known to man. You know that's actually true.

226
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,920
The world needs more spontaneous para para dancing. The background to Zenon

227
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,960
is really stupid. Yes! Not every song needs

228
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,600
challenge steps. That's true. I'm done.

229
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,100
Good.

230
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,600
Oh, you spent. Good. Shut up. I'm just kidding.

231
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,600
You know what's funny? How come we've never had Moogle Hunter on this show? He frickin' lives not too far away.

232
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,100
On drugs.

233
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,600
Yeah, because he's too busy doing drugs. Apparently.

234
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,600
And then to quote Dennis Suri, when he dies we'll smoke his ashes.

235
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
Who did that song? Who gets credit for that?

236
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
Omni Crash.

237
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,600
Omni Crash.

238
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
He didn't say Oni, right?

239
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,600
Yeah, he mispronounced a bunch of words.

240
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,600
He must be Canadian or something.

241
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,600
Why?

242
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
Is he Canadian?

243
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,600
Yep.

244
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
Because Canadian's pronouncing's funny.

245
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
What the hell is circular?

246
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,600
Yeah, he said like circular and D-U-I's.

247
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,600
Zenon.

248
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
Zenon.

249
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,040
I think he's Canadian.

250
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

251
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,040
Whenever you make a mistake, just pretend you're Canadian.

252
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,040
I'm Canadian.

253
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,040
Hey, I fucked up.

254
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:57,800
I don't expect you to be smart.

255
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,600
You should put the right emphasis on the correct syllable.

256
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:08,600
uh...

257
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,980
because he's thinking about his blood job that is getting right then

258
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,680
and i'm thinking about it has to adapt i'm thinking about the new intro and all

259
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:25,680
the clips from jamie i think that

260
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,680
I'm going to do a video here and do a blowjob, you know, that's great.

261
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,680
This is why you told your mom not to listen.

262
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,680
Well, this works.

263
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,840
street blowjobs

264
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,600
did well that's why it is not just it would have to freeze on you

265
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,360
he's media player

266
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,120
in the meantime i will do a song and dance as many of you will see who are here

267
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,400
beautiful beautiful

268
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,760
roc did a nice dance last night

269
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,760
i was here watching across the screen in a tutu

270
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,980
i have never had so many people yelling at me

271
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,180
in a tutu

272
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:25,000
come to think of it i've never wanted to do before last night really it's easy to

273
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,820
be you should have won at least the frank wager something

274
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:31,080
i know i should have had a way that you were still fabulous trying to dig up a

275
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,260
way backstage we can find one of the we literally pulled that routine out of our

276
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:34,660
ass

277
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:38,300
you know it's ironic to you or my outfit i want to get me up there

278
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,780
did they try

279
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:44,160
and then he tried to get me to go in for a minute that he doesn't know

280
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,160
you know it's time you want to help

281
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:54,080
a little shopping yeah what are you uh shopping for

282
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,040
okay listen i'm gonna be honest with you do you want to uh be interested in making a little

283
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:14,880
extra money hey to help you out with your shopping oh yeah okay all right then dude

284
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,880
That looks like Arden Fair.

285
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,880
Oh my god, it does!

286
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,880
Now I'm following you.

287
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,880
for some company. I just wondered if you're interested.

288
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,880
Um, what do you have in mind?

289
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,880
What do I have in mind?

290
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,880
Film a server, that's not going to turn the blood off.

291
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,880
Oh, but...

292
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,880
So, like, out of that whole thing, there were, like, maybe two seconds of a blowjob.

293
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,880
Dude, you should send that...

294
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,880
Obviously an actress.

295
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,880
You should send that to Evan for a pre-show.

296
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,240
That totally, I swear to God that's a mall I've been to.

297
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,360
I think it was one in L.A. though.

298
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,660
This is the sad thing. This shows you like what a queer I am, okay?

299
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:05,660
I recognize the Campbell store in the background.

300
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:15,360
I want my old papa blocker back because this one sucks ass.

301
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:22,360
hey while you're on that site give me the one for uh... new york

302
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,600
yeah anyway what are we talking about before we start talking about sex

303
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,000
oh yeah our moms um...

304
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,620
because without that our mom we wouldn't be here today

305
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,860
dude we were having a cool conversation though at that truck stop

306
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:39,800
uh... but that's great

307
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:44,800
Some people we know were likely conceived.

308
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:59,800
We're talking about life being a sexually transmitted fatal disease that's hereditary.

309
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,800
That's the secret of life?

310
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,800
It is a sexually transmitted fatal disease that's hereditary.

311
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,800
Think about it.

312
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,800
It is.

313
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
Hmm.

314
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
Hmm.

315
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,800
Kind of makes you think.

316
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,800
Hmm.

317
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,560
Things that make you go, hmm.

318
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,280
We should have philosophical quote of the evening.

319
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,160
I think that should be it.

320
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,360
That could be something that we bring in for season three type thing, you know, our new

321
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,680
and improved Orange Lounge Radio.

322
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,440
We improve the quality of your life through higher thinking, mainly because some of us

323
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,440
might be high.

324
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,440
I don't know.

325
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,440
I don't do drugs.

326
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,440
I drink soapy.

327
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,440
I don't do drugs either, but I do eat a lot of sugar.

328
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,440
That stupid old people store didn't have any for pal.

329
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,440
You went to a stupid old people's store?

330
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,440
We went there with a price less.

331
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,440
Oh, God, that is an old people's store. I don't know people's stores.

332
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:53,440
But, like, if you need to get, you know, like, toothbrushes and all your drug store needs there,

333
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,440
it's really cheap and you can get prescriptions, they're cheap too.

334
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:01,440
That's the only store where you walk in and you have lawn furniture, lawn care, you turn the corner,

335
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,600
have herbal, like, stuff, and then you go back around and you see nothing but prune

336
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:12,920
juice and diapers. Tampons! Tampons! Tampons! Do you need a tampon, Rob? Are you feeling

337
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:18,120
not so fresh? They just have diapers for that over there. And like, their soda is like one

338
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,080
case. They don't even have like, anything. And there's like the whole section dedicated

339
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,560
to soy and wild yam products. For women who need their energy. Spam, spam, spam, spebity

340
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:33,560
No, wild yam. Women can take it when they're going through menopause to help with hot flashes.

341
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,560
See, something that none of you people probably knew. I worked at GNC for a long time.

342
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,560
I needed to know.

343
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:46,560
Trust me, women, you're going to get through menopause in one day. Mine's 20 years off.

344
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,560
I'm never having kids either.

345
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,560
Dear women.

346
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,560
Dear women, this is Jamie's herbal tip of the day.

347
00:27:54,560 --> 00:28:01,240
You smoke the weed, not eat it.

348
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,100
Somebody in the chat room is insinuating that I have that not so fresh feeling.

349
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,100
You don't.

350
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,960
I feel, I've been feeling a little, I wouldn't say I don't feel not so fresh, I just feel

351
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,960
not so like...

352
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,160
See, I think, I think that Frank would have been in a better mood if he had feminine wipes.

353
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:24,120
See, he was probably getting, from all of the rampant mookie that he has been known

354
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:28,280
for, if he had just cleaned himself up a little bit, he wouldn't have been so itchy and would

355
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,280
have felt a lot better.

356
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,160
And been nicer to people.

357
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,160
Maybe if he had a puppy.

358
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,680
I was a little bit itchy after last night's show, because I just sweated so much.

359
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,360
Has any of that stuff been washed?

360
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,540
The costumes?

361
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:44,400
They wash them, they don't wash them every week, but they wash them like once a month.

362
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,400
Okay, cause I was gonna say, it's probably a good idea.

363
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,400
I do wash my underwear.

364
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,400
No, I wasn't talking about your underwear. I don't care about your underwear.

365
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,400
If you want to wear itchy underwear, you can.

366
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,400
That's your prerogative.

367
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,400
That's my ride as an American.

368
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:03,400
If I want to wear dirty underwear in public, you can't stop me.

369
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,400
No, we'll buy you panty liners.

370
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,400
Hey look, your neighbors are moving.

371
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,400
Hi neighbors.

372
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,400
No, you know why.

373
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,720
right now is in the middle of it

374
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,760
low-key what are you doing

375
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,220
i was getting my acid for work because uh...

376
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,060
i have created my computer and i'll talk about that later

377
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,540
delay

378
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:32,220
are you to make the a speed remix here at the end of the a male key remix

379
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:36,560
oh yeah i know i have to find it on the internet cuz i think i know a place

380
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,920
where it might be is going to download it from

381
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,920
from mbz.com, you know, my butthole.

382
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:53,920
See, I could probably sit on a record and fart out a better remix than that one.

383
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,920
I'm not going to still use record player.

384
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:01,920
I didn't sit on a record player, I just sit on a record.

385
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,920
You missed movie night last week when we watched a Troma movie.

386
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,920
When was movie night?

387
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,920
At Evans.

388
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,840
What'd you guys watch? I don't know what the name of the movie was

389
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,420
I don't know. I don't remember but it was one of those trauma movies where they get all these cats

390
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,420
No, it was Catholic schoolgirl hell

391
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:21,180
That's the name of the movie. I think cool where they go into this house

392
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,540
But there were no boobs and there was you know, the blood was made out of a1

393
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,440
But like they go in this house and

394
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:35,600
like this little boy goes in first on dare and he comes out and has a seizure and goes in the hospital and

395
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:42,580
And then these girls go in to because the man who lived in the house died and the girls go in to

396
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,760
Catalog the paintings and things with this nun the nun was cool. I

397
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,320
Bet like that little kid went to a seizure because a priest touched him. No

398
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,680
Oh my god the acting that was so horrible and then like no one died cool

399
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,860
Except for the girl who got caught in a meat hook, but all they showed was her feet with a1

400
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:08,700
And one girl got electrocuted, and another one got pulled into the swamp and some guy

401
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,980
got run over.

402
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:16,860
My friend Garrett has this trauma movie, Killer Condom, that he's been trying to get us to

403
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:21,460
watch that for weeks and weeks, and we never seem to get around to watching it, there's

404
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:25,260
always something better to do, like play pop music or something, but we're gonna watch

405
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,300
Killer Condom one of these nights, you'll have to come watch.

406
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,100
I'm sure Garrett would love to have you come over and watch it.

407
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:39,560
you do now? My headphones are attached to a giant pile of cords. It's like, what Loki's

408
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:44,100
doing right now is pulling out the Christmas tree lights at Christmas time and finding

409
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:48,000
they're just in one giant pile. You know what? In my house, that never was an issue because

410
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,080
I was evil with the twisty ties. I always hated pulling out the lights and having them

411
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,580
be all tangly, so I would wrap them in a circle and bunch them together and twisty tie them.

412
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,620
You're so anally-retentively fun.

413
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,580
I bite my ass. I'll show you anal-retentive.

414
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:09,740
See, what happens when you have a steel-toed boot shoved up your butt from kicking?

415
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:13,680
You'll be coughin' up nails.

416
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,780
I don't think I've ever heard you so, like, threatening on this show before.

417
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:20,020
You're a badass bitch tonight.

418
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,180
I am?

419
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,460
Yes, you am. I didn't mean that, by the way.

420
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:27,780
I mean it with puppies.

421
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,780
Wait, you're going to kick Puppy in the ass?

422
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,280
No.

423
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,280
What did he do to you?

424
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,280
You're a mean old lady.

425
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,780
No, I'm going to get Puppy a puppy.

426
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,280
Are you going to get Puppy a puppy?

427
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,780
When he has somewhere, he can have a puppy.

428
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,780
That's very nice of you.

429
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,280
I'm sure he appreciates that.

430
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,280
And now we have the little frowny face from Puppy in the chat room

431
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,280
as the buffer hits him.

432
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,280
I'm not kicking Puppy.

433
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,280
I like Puppy right there.

434
00:32:49,280 --> 00:33:04,440
I didn't go there. I'm sorry I'm sorry. She did. Yeah I did, I did. Here, have some more

435
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:15,440
hazelnut bites. Okay, give me. What are these? Let's re... Sorry, Loki's ass. Oops. I didn't

436
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:23,040
I threw nut cream at his ass.

437
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:29,380
This is Locher Quadratini Hazelnut Premium Wafer Cookies and they're filled with hazelnut

438
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,380
cream.

439
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,380
They're European.

440
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,380
Number one in Italy.

441
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:38,200
I got them at the old people's store.

442
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,380
They were $2.00.

443
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,040
They look like old people food.

444
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,040
No, they're international.

445
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,440
Even if you eat them, you're cultured.

446
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,240
You sure could use it.

447
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:56,920
I don't feel any culture.

448
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:00,760
Hey, look, ain't I done by the guy who did Tenchi?

449
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,760
What is that?

450
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,760
I don't know.

451
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,760
Masquerade?

452
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,760
Is that what it's called?

453
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,760
Yeah.

454
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,760
I want to finish watching Breakin'.

455
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
Let's read what Masquerade is about.

456
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,960
Give me the nuts.

457
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,240
Endless passion.

458
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,000
Insatiable desire.

459
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,060
nineteen-year-old gins family i've watched this one okay it's about this

460
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:19,240
check that's going after this one guy because he has

461
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,240
what was it the essence of permanence or something like that

462
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,080
in other words he has golden sperm that's like proves that he's immortal

463
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,340
and some something

464
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,900
key of immortality anyways it's just an excuse for her to try to like

465
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,180
get them off

466
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:35,740
in which he does and then he becomes like some demon thing that bites her and

467
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,200
so she becomes a vampire

468
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,880
and has to like uh...

469
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,840
live in their house with this other vampire servant that like

470
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:47,840
All of a sudden gets weak, and the only way she can become stronger is by having sex, and then, uh, and the end.

471
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,840
I wanna watch it.

472
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,840
That was beautiful.

473
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,840
I wanna finish watching Breakin'. We were watching Breakin' before the show.

474
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,840
We can finish watching Breakin' after the show.

475
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,840
But if we start watching Breakin', there's not gonna be a show, and our listeners will get mad, and they'll write us death threats.

476
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,840
No, they won't.

477
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,840
They'll just whine online.

478
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,840
They can listen to the cool music.

479
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,840
Yes, lots of cool music.

480
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,840
They can listen along.

481
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,840
What other 80s movies do you love, other than Breakin'?

482
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,840
Breakin' 2, Electric Boogaloo.

483
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,840
Sorry, did I say that again?

484
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,840
Breakin' 2, Electric Boogaloo.

485
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:29,840
I don't appoint because they can probably see us all pointing at us.

486
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,840
And they're moving out.

487
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:39,840
When I see that bed moving by, I'm like, I wonder how many times people have said sex on that bed.

488
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:46,060
Did you see how old they were? I don't think they had too much sex. Just because they're old doesn't mean they don't have sex

489
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:52,100
Well, that's like 50% of the old people population actually do what the fuck am I talking about? It's not an old people having sex

490
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,480
I'm weird, you know, you're really pulling down the quality of the show

491
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,800
All I did was sat there it just said everything you guys said over and over again

492
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,200
So you guys talked about the chub stock truck stop

493
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,200
But it's cool when we do it.

494
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,860
and how we were all bored at

495
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:15,640
truck stops or something like that. But it's cool when we do it.

496
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,300
Go download more blowjobs.

497
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,900
Go hang out at a truck stop.

498
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,420
Wow.

499
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,320
Wow. I think now is a good time to take a break.

500
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,200
No. What are you doing?

501
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,680
Oh no.

502
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,540
Okay, uh...

503
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:38,660
Let's see here.

504
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:43,180
Is this going to sound like something Twen did?

505
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,100
No, he downloaded it.

506
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:44,980
Maybe.

507
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,380
He downloaded it, Rob.

508
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,900
He downloaded it.

509
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,620
Downloaded it, yes.

510
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:52,380
Off of LBZ.com.

511
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,020
I have to fix something because, hold on.

512
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,700
Oh, I'll play it after the break.

513
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,900
OK, so this is something to look forward to.

514
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,420
Is it the Naoki remix?

515
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,620
Did Naoki do some pew-pews in this song and stuff?

516
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:38,980
and then we'll be back in a little bit. We'll see you soon. And then we have a request from

517
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:44,140
the chat room to talk about Pump It Up, which we haven't done that in a long time, so we'll

518
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:51,140
talk about Pump It Up, that might be fun. Okay, so we'll be back in a little bit. Enjoy.

519
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:55,540
You're standing there with your arms folded like you couldn't care

520
00:39:55,540 --> 00:40:00,540
Even before you glanced at me, I already felt the chemistry

521
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:06,540
Don't know what it is about you that's got me feeling mesmerized

522
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:12,540
I won't let you get away, boy, you're the lucky one

523
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:19,540
I don't need you, cause the truth is, got my hands full of fatties

524
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:25,540
But I want you, gonna put you, at the very very top of my lips

525
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:48,540
I don't need you, cause the truth is, got my hands full of happiness

526
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:54,540
I don't need you, cause the truth is, got my hands full of happiness

527
00:40:54,540 --> 00:41:00,540
But I want you, gonna put you, at the very very top of my lips

528
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:07,540
Yeah, I want you, gonna have you, and that's the way it is

529
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:13,540
Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of

530
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,820
the Orange Drowned Spring Money Music and More show?

531
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:23,340
The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

532
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,540
It's unearthly.

533
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:30,060
It's like being in a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

534
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,420
Hello, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

535
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,220
We need to find that movie again.

536
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,540
That thing is freaking hilarious.

537
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,340
It was pretty funny.

538
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:39,260
I remember it was on Konami's official site, I think.

539
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,820
Yeah, it was linked from there somewhere.

540
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:44,100
So, Loki, did you finish downloading your A remix?

541
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,380
Yeah, I had to figure out what I did.

542
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,420
I had to figure out what I did, because I

543
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,800
had to plug in my headphones just

544
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,740
to make sure that it was the right copy, you know?

545
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,300
So I had to hook it back up.

546
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,640
It'll just take one second.

547
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,140
All righty.

548
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,980
One.

549
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,740
Anyone seen any good movies lately?

550
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:03,140
No. Have you not seen X2 yet?

551
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,740
No. No? Not yet?

552
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,540
I'll take you later.

553
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,740
When? Because I want to go see it again. I don't know.

554
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:11,740
But then The Matrix is coming out. I have to go see that too.

555
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:12,540
So I don't know.

556
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:17,180
Because I want to go see X2 again for Iceman.

557
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:20,540
Hey, I'm going for my fuzzy elf.

558
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,460
You're going for your fuzzy elf? My fuzzy elf.

559
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:26,100
Who's your fuzzy elf? Nightcrawler. Nightcrawler. Do you remember how they...

560
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:29,960
You never read the comics? No, of course I didn't. I watched the cartoon on Fox though.

561
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,260
I like Jubilee. That's not even. I like Jubilee.

562
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,600
I read the comics when all of the way out was in high school.

563
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,120
When they were cool.

564
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:41,580
Yeah, well we need to go see. Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler? Oh, he's great.

565
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:45,800
Did he keep them Cumming and Cumming and Cumming? Yes, he kept us Cumming. All right.

566
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,480
So take me tomorrow. No, no.

567
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,280
Now, I don't know if this is a fake one because, you know, I got it off of MGZ and, you know,

Oh, this is great.

591
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:22,820
Wow.

592
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:25,820
An Orange Lounge Radio exclusive.

593
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:29,820
You know, I wonder if somebody submitted that to the Bimani-style remix contest.

594
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:37,820
contest. If not, I think we need to do it on their behalf.

595
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:41,820
You know what? I don't really think that was snucky. I think that it was good cool.

596
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:47,820
You know what's sad is my sound card sucks ass and is brand new. I am so... I'll leave

597
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:52,820
it for later. I got to make a list. Yeah, I can do that.

598
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:54,820
Your sound card is number one in Italy.

599
00:46:54,820 --> 00:47:08,820
Your sound card is the sexiest bean tadpole on the planet.

600
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,820
I hope somebody got that joke.

601
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:11,820
Your house is hot.

602
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:18,820
You know what, I think we ought to enter that remix and say it's Twin, and I bet people would believe it.

603
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:22,820
No, because Twin's not talented enough to put another beat behind it.

604
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,820
I bet he's listening.

605
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:26,820
You want to say hello?

606
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,820
Hi, Twan!

607
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:34,820
With love, Orange Lounge Radio, XXLO

608
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:37,820
You still ain't getting back in the chatroom.

609
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:41,820
That was a good laugh.

610
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:46,820
We're having a day on Orange Lounge Radio.

611
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:49,820
This is so different being here. I'm sitting on a couch.

612
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:50,820
Is it cool?

613
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:51,820
Is it?

614
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:52,820
I was laying down on the couch.

615
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:55,100
You have a vanilla coke.

616
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,460
I have a vanilla coke?

617
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,460
It's gone.

618
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,460
Shit!

619
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,460
What the fuck?

620
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:06,380
The vanilla coke jumped out and attacked my phone.

621
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:07,940
I thought there was still stuff in it.

622
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:10,300
Rob, you need a trash can by your computer.

623
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:13,340
Well, I can get up and walk to the kitchen.

624
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:14,340
I am capable.

625
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:15,340
But you'd rather not.

626
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:16,340
I say next break we open the door.

627
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:17,340
Just to let air out.

628
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:20,340
We need to open the door, just to let air out.

629
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,340
Yeah, we can open the window.

630
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,340
To let air out.

631
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:23,340
To let air out in here.

632
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:26,340
Or are we just trying on a fan?

633
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:30,340
Save electricity, open the door.

634
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:36,340
Anyway, they're saying in the chat room that we were dissing Italy.

635
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:37,340
We weren't.

636
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,340
We were reading it off a bag of cookies.

637
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:42,340
This bag of cookies is number one in Italy.

638
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,340
We need to get the webcam, no we don't need the webcam hooked up.

639
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:46,340
We need a scanner.

640
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:50,800
I'll scan this when I get home and put it up. We'll figure out something creative with the webcam

641
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,460
I think we're going to do is we're gonna have the webcam and we'll just put it in the corner and pointed it away

642
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,540
oh my god, it really is written in Italian and

643
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,860
and Chinese it don't open it now and

644
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:04,180
Holy crap, it's written in Hebrew. I

645
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:11,360
Kid you not the the stuff about the the cookies is written in Hebrew look

646
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,360
Look.

647
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,360
That's scary.

648
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:17,360
Can you read it for us?

649
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,360
Fuck no.

650
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:27,040
Well, as we promised, there's many things coming up this week that's exciting, E3 being

651
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:32,600
the big one that's on everybody's minds, the Electronic Entertainment Expo or maybe I got

652
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,600
that backwards.

653
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,080
I don't really give a shit because I'm not going.

654
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:40,960
And Jamie unfortunately isn't going because she has that job thing going on.

655
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:46,960
0, it's not going. And Loki is not going either.

656
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,960
But Dan always brings back neat stuff for you guys.

657
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,960
Well, he hasn't been there before, but he did from that manager meeting he went to.

658
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:57,960
But E3 is going to be like this big fat deal, and we're going to get a lot of Imani news next week,

659
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,960
which is interesting because we don't really have a show next Sunday.

660
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,960
No.

661
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,960
But in two weeks we'll be back with episode number 45, our season 3 premiere,

662
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:20,960
We will have lots to talk about from E3, because in those two weeks, there's going to be so much news it's going to make you cry, because maybe we're finally probably going to hear a confirmation on DDRXBox, whether it's legit or not, although it's looking more and more legit, because...

663
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:21,960
Don't forget about 2DX USA.

664
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:30,960
2DX USA rumors will finally be put to rest one way or the other, as well as Max2 USA will have lots of news, I'm sure.

665
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:36,960
A friend who goes every year, always videotapes the different big booths they go to.

666
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,960
I'm going to ask him to record a bunch of the stuff on the Bimani, thanks for me.

667
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,960
And Metal Gear Solid 3 is going to be a big thing too.

668
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:44,960
Oh my god, that was cool.

669
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:45,960
Because the trailer's out now.

670
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:51,960
There's also the new Metal Gear Solid for the GameCube that they're coming out with.

671
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,960
Ooh yay, I don't know why I love my GameCube.

672
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:59,960
My GameCube is my favorite system now, and I would buy that on the GameCube.

673
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:09,960
They said it was like Metal Gear Solid, the first one's story with the second one's graphics in Game Boy. That's what it's supposed to be.

674
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:15,960
I want to know more about that Final Fantasy game they're doing for GameCube. I hope it doesn't suck. Please don't suck. Please don't suck.

675
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,960
And Mario Kart Double Dash, oh yeah.

676
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,960
Squeenix is back with Nintendo.

677
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:27,960
And I bet you they're going to show a lot of Final Fantasy XI stuff at E3. Although it's already out in Japan, but you know.

678
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,960
My demo disk needs to hurry up and get to my house.

679
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,960
Will you have a demo disk of it coming?

680
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,960
Well, I signed up for the beta.

681
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,960
And to be a beta tester for the PC version.

682
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:45,960
And I have a feeling that I'm going to get it because I've at least played every game out there except for 4.11.

683
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:53,960
And that and I've beta tested a bunch of other stuff, so I'm pretty sure to get it.

684
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,960
And Dan signed up for the PS2 one.

685
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:08,960
I'm just pissed though because I was thinking of getting the Japanese one when it came out, except that it would have been really expensive for me because I would have had to get an external hard drive for my PS2 because I have a first model Japanese one.

686
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:15,960
Two hundred something dollars still and I refuse to shop at BuyRight because they suck.

687
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,960
I was telling my friend Garrett about your BuyRight experiences because he thinks they suck too. They did something to him that picked him off.

688
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,460
off.

689
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:25,840
They really suck a big ass.

690
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:26,920
Never shot from Bi-Rite.

691
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,920
I know.

692
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,920
Would you explain this to me?

693
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,820
I kind of know what it is, but I thought our listeners might benefit.

694
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:34,040
The difference between, because I know this is your beef with Bi-Rite, the difference

695
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:37,760
between buying a game that's Asia and buying a game that's Japan.

696
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:44,400
There's really not a difference in the game itself, but when you get your manual, it's

697
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:51,160
going to be written all in, I think it's Mandarin Chinese, as opposed to being written in Japanese.

698
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:56,440
And for me it was a big thing because I would have at least a chance of reading a Japanese

699
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,660
manual instead of one written in Chinese.

700
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:05,800
And the other thing is, is that I could have gone to YesAsia and gotten it for $30 cheaper.

701
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:09,760
Instead I paid more and there it went.

702
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,760
But I see that a lot.

703
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:15,360
Like I was looking around at stuff on NCSX the other night and they have Asia, Japan,

704
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:18,920
they have it pretty clearly defined the differences between the two when you're buying them.

705
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,920
That's why it's good to shop at NCSX.

706
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:26,160
Um, but I was just, you know, I was kind of curious what the difference is, and, you know, I thought maybe our listeners could benefit from that too.

707
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,040
They should just never shop from BuyRight. And also if you sign up for their mailing list at all.

708
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,680
Because somehow they signed me up for it when I emailed a question.

709
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:39,880
They, I've, I've submitted so many times. Threatened legal action, because you can actually sue them for that.

710
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:44,200
Um, and they haven't removed me, so I blocked. That's part of the reason why my Dr. Soccer mail is blocked.

711
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,480
Ah, I got it. But, um,

712
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,320
I'm actually going to get on the line one day and call them,

713
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:54,480
and tell them that if they do not remove my name for their mailing list that I am going to press charges.

714
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,680
And I will!

715
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,320
You know, well that's going to be a law in California pretty soon about the whole

716
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,520
you can

717
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,560
sue them for five hundred dollars or something like that. It's crazy.

718
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:05,260
And you get a hundred dollars of that?

719
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:08,480
No, I'm sorry, you get the state to give them a fine. The state can

720
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,760
fine them for that and you get a hundred dollars of that.

721
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,720
That's awesome.

722
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:19,040
All the spam lists? Uh-huh. Uh-uh. I'm going to save every last one of them.

723
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,040
I'd be rich.

724
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,040
Yep.

725
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,040
What else?

726
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:25,040
Oh, yes, Logie.

727
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,920
I hate you Creative Lab.

728
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:27,920
You can die.

729
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,320
I'll get into that later.

730
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,660
Okay.

731
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:35,520
Also coming up this weekend, big, big, big, big news.

732
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,480
This is something we will be attending.

733
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:42,240
That's B3, the other three thing, and that's this weekend.

734
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,120
Whatever happened to C3 and D3?

735
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,120
I don't know.

736
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,120
Maybe they happened in your chat.

737
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,120
C4 blew up C3.

738
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:52,200
was a c3 m movie with chris rock

739
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,440

00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,620

00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:02,060

B3.

747
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:21,220
B3 is going to be this huge-ass tournament that's going on and it's taken place in San

748
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:25,060
Francisco on Pier 39 and they're having four or five competitions.

749
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:32,980
It's Perfect Attack, Freestyle, Dance Maniacs, and B Mania 3.

750
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:36,940
I think there was something else going on, I probably forgot, but you can get onto DDR

751
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:41,620
Free, you can check the official tournament thread for more information on that.

752
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:48,620
we will be broadcasting to you that weekend on Saturday for sure, Sunday hopefully, if

753
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:52,500
we can get it to work out. I just received some news we might not be able to get it to

754
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:56,500
work out, but hopefully we do. But we'll be coming to you all day long on Saturday for

755
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:01,500
sure. And we're going to have a really good location from what I understand. So, hold

756
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:06,500
on. Do you want to say anything to the listeners? Wait one second, say it one more time on the

757
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,180

00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:11,480

765
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,280
pattern

766
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,280
that was jane's hand.

767
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:40,160
My microphone's really loud now.

768
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,160
Where were we?

769
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,160
Yes, B3, all those companies.

770
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,240
We're going to have a really good location Saturday from what I understand.

771
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,240
That's going to be awesome.

772
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,240
You can't freaking...

773
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,040
Are they going to feed us?

774
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,040
I don't know.

775
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,400
I don't think they're going to feed us, but I hear we get other perks, but I can't say

776
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,280
what those are yet, but I'll tell you off air.

777
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,280
Ooh.

778
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,280
There's some cool things.

779
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,760
So we get free man servants.

780
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,760
Ooh.

781
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,080
I don't want a man servant.

782
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:03,000
That's weak sauce, man.

783
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
We have intern zero.

784
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
We don't need another man-servant.

785
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,560
I'm talking about naked men-servants.

786
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:12,560
I'm talking about harem-men.

787
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,200
Maybe we can talk puppy or something into being a man-servant.

788
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,040
I don't want puppy to be a harem-man.

789
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:23,440
I want my harem-man to- Because we're going to be celebrities at

790
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,440
B3.

791
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,640
We need to have like Insta on a trailer.

792
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,580
We're the Orange Lounge radio people.

793
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,580
We're celebrities now.

794
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:33,320
We need people coming to our booth asking for autographs and we go,

795
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:37,640
Sorry, no time, no time. See my publicist. Call me. We'll do lunch. Blah, blah, blah.

796
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:42,440
I'm still thinking about auctioning off my bat.

797
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,440
At the tournament?

798
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,200
Maybe we should auction off my bat at the tournament.

799
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:50,200
Aren't you going to be sad to see that go?

800
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,200
Yes, I will.

801
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:59,200
How could I ever consider getting rid of my beloved bat? Dude, they're moving tables now.

802
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,360
Bye, neighbors!

803
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:05,760
We already have people in the chat room claiming dibs on the orange bat.

804
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,200
So maybe look forward to that.

805
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,080
Maybe we'll do a silent auction for my bat.

806
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,760
Are we giving away door prizes?

807
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:12,760
Don't know?

808
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:13,760
Maybe.

809
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:14,760
Hopefully a few.

810
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:15,760
We at least have that one box of stuff, right?

811
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:16,760
The one that you wanted to...

812
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:17,760
Make up my circle.

813
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,760
Okay.

814
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,520
I think we should do a silent auction for the orange bat.

815
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:22,520
Okay.

816
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,160
So you're thinking about a silent auction for the orange bat?

817
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,240
You should do one for yours.

818
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:28,200
We should auction off your bat to you, signed by us.

819
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,200
We could do that.

820
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,200
The host.

821
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,200
Okay.

822
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,200
And then you would have to go get your bats.

823
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:37,200
And then we can enter and do a routine at the biggest tournament in NorCal.

824
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,200
No!

825
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:41,920
Okay, so we're probably going to do a silent auction for Jamie's Bat and My Bat, so that's

826
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:42,920
something to look forward to.

827
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:46,280
We are going to be giving away some door prizes, we don't know how many, but we'll be giving

828
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,280
away some.

829
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,400
So stop by our table, maybe we'll do like a random drawing or something like, come get

830
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,640
interviewed on the show and get a ticket in the drawing.

831
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,040
Maybe we'll do something like that, that'll be fun.

832
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,720
And yeah, so definitely look for us.

833
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,840
But except, it can't just be come be interviewed on the show, like we have to interview them

834
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,960
and ask them really humiliating questions.

835
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,360
I just remembered that one question on the sex quiz.

836
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:11,240
I'll ask Travis if maybe we can borrow the sex quiz, if he wouldn't mind.

837
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:14,640
Shrimping.

838
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,840

we can see if we can borrow one out of the what the hell that's why i think

857
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:10,640
creative labs has every single version of the sound blaster listed on their

858
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,500
say except the one-and-a-half

859
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:16,740

860
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:19,780
and then mine sound blaster live five one okay

861
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:23,900

862
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:25,340
five one gamer

863
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:39,980
The

864
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:43,180
chat room is suggesting that I cosplay Mr. Spanky for B3.

865
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:52,180
And you know what's scary is I have seen that exact thing that Mr. Spanky wears in a leather store in San Francisco on Folsom Street.

866
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:54,180
So I could go buy it.

867
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:58,180
Rob, we've seen you in a corset, Rob.

868
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:01,180
You need to do Dr. Dick.

869
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:03,180
You need to go up there as Frank.

870
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:07,180
I have contemplated doing a Dr. Dick routine, however I have no time to plan one.

871
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:10,180
Who needs to plan one?

872
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:13,180
cuz this is B3 and I feel like I should put some effort into it.

873
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:16,180
I don't know if I even can compete. Technically we're staff. I might not be able to compete.

874
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:18,180
Let's not worry about it.

875
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:20,180
We'll do an exhibition.

876
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:25,180
Ooh exhibitionism. Dr. Dick does an exhibitionism. That's an exciting idea.

877
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:34,180
But I have to find some big, I have to find like a big fur coat and some shiny shirts and things like that.

878
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:39,180
I'll have to go shopping at some gay stores this week and see what I can find.

879
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:41,180
I should buy my costume at Naughty and Nice.

880
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:44,180
Who are the Goldies?

881
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:47,180
Dr. Dick in Mantis.

882
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:49,180
We'll get you a school uniform.

883
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:51,180
I could dress up like an Asian schoolgirl.

884
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:53,180
We could do Battle Royale.

885
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:55,180
Ooh. What would be a good song?

886
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:58,180
Oh my god, I downloaded a high resolution scan of the collar.

887
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:04,180
What would be a fun freestyle song for Battle Royale?

888
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:08,180
Like all of us could get up there and we could keep killing each other off during the song?

889
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:10,180
Dead End?

890
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:14,180
dukeofthebump

891
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:47,180
I've been helping him gain levels because I am so happy because I have a plus five stiletto now.

892
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,180
And that means in English?

893
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:52,180
That means I can kill things faster and have them kill me less.

894
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:54,180
Cool.

895
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:59,180
If there was this one critter, it would take me a whole life bar to kill and now I can kill five of them.

896
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:01,180
Very nice. Congratulations.

897
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:05,180
I'm a nerd.

898
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:32,180
LOKI and I wanted to talk about G4 real fast, because we got cable a couple weeks ago, I think you remember on the show we were talking about how we just got cable, so we've had a little time now to actually watch some G4, and this is television for gamers, and we know that a lot of you don't have G4, so we thought we'd talk to you, we thought LOKI and I would talk to you about what we've seen on G4, what's cool and what sucks.

899
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:37,180
Okay, what's cool? First off, best show on all of G4? StarCade.

900
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:39,180
StarCade rocks.

901
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:47,180
Old school game show from 83 where they play video games like Pac-Man and Pango and Pole Position, and they win video games.

902
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:48,180
They win arcade machines.

903
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:50,180
Hands down the best show on G4.

904
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:53,180
Okay, now what sucks about G4, Loki?

905
01:03:53,180 --> 01:04:02,180
Well, actually, there's one more good show on there. It's called, uh, that's called, like, Electric Play or something like that, or something like that.

906
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:11,180
It's where they review only action games. It's pretty cool. And they do these little skit things that are kind of funny. Those are mildly entertaining.

907
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:21,180
Now, what really sucks, um, is this one show, Portal, is the gayest show I've ever seen. Seriously, this guy that looks like...

908
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:23,160
Wait a minute, gayer than queerest folk?

909
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:24,540
Yes, it's pretty bad.

910
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:28,700
It's like, OK, this guy is like, I

911
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:31,100
would say he's pretty much like the gamer

912
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,860
version of Blue's Clues.

913
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:37,100
This guy is just sitting there talking to nobody,

914
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:39,740
except for this imaginary computer thing that's

915
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:42,620
supposedly in the studio that talks to him about really

916
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:44,940
stupid things, and they're making it sound all high tech

917
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:45,780
and cool.

918
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:48,540
And all he does is he talks about different cities

919
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:50,860
and towns and stuff that are in online games.

920
01:04:50,860 --> 01:05:08,860
Then they do this stupid little, like, skit where they have these people walking around or whatever in, like, online games, and they're, like, making them talk, you know, dubbing over their voices and doing little stories. It's really retarded. It is just dumb. It is damn awful.

921
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:17,860
That sounded like, um, an idea that I was gonna do for a Ragnarok Online fan comic.

922
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:20,860
Yeah, that game sucks.

923
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:21,860
It's dumb to watch on the show.

924
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:24,860
This game called High Score really sucks.

925
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:30,860
It's some, like, UK version of Starrcade, but, you know, obvious.

926
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:31,860
Starrcade!

927
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:32,860
It's just crap.

928
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:37,860
And then Nick Arcade isn't on G4, but it is on Nickelodeon Gas,

929
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:39,860
Games and Sports, Nick Gas.

930
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:45,860
Yeah, and also what really sucks is they've got these stupid commercials

931
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:51,860
The commercials where they show the Twin Galaxies world records for like these two games.

932
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:52,860
Two games, they have like...

933
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:57,860
That's old school Orange Lounge topics right there talking about Twin Galaxies and their old DDR.

934
01:05:57,860 --> 01:06:00,860
They're just awful, awful, awful.

935
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:04,860
But I'll have you know though that they did, what was it?

936
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:09,860
Entertainment Weekly and G4 did the top 100 games of all time.

937
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:13,860
And Dance Dancer Revolution was number 40, I think.

938
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:14,860
What was number one?

939
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:21,080
Legend Zelda. I forget what number two was. There was another series. Another series.

940
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:28,420
Guardian Legend wasn't on the list. Those bastards at all. Was ET on there? No. What

941
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:36,580
about Custer's Revenge? No. No. What else? There's a few that were really stupid that

942
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:44,280
beat up like other ones. Like Grand Theft Auto was under, I can't remember. There's

943
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,500
just a lot of really dumb games on the list.

944
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:52,140
Maybe I could find that list online somewhere. Maybe it's on G4. I'll see if I can find it.

945
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:54,420
Keep talking about G4 while I look for this list.

946
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:58,780
Then they have like these stupid like intimate moments with Laura Croft where there's this

947
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:05,380
guy talking to her and it's just like retarded. I mean, this guy is like talking to the chick

948
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:09,620
that's supposedly next to him and he's not making a play at all. I mean, what a loser.

949
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:13,340
If there's going to be some, like, you know, intimate moments, I want to see some intimate

950
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:19,260
moments, I want to see this, hi, don't you hate it that people think that, you know,

951
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:25,100
your unintelligent stuff, he should be like, bitch, get down on my lap, you know, stuff

952
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:30,700
like that. Because, I mean, it's just really awful, really awful TV. And then they have

953
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:35,020
these stupid screenshots, they do have different games and stuff and that was awful and it's

954
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:37,020
p0k3smot42o 1 dude just got a total jackass

955
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:37,820
You about to fall asleep, Jamie?

956
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:38,820
We need to do Fuck You's of the Week.

957
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:41,660
Do you want to do the Cage Mash now, or do you want to do Fuck You's now?

958
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:42,660
Huh?

959
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,660
You want to do Fuck You's now?

960
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:45,660
Excuse you!

961
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:46,660
I'm just kidding.

962
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:49,560
Uh, we'll take a quick break and we'll come back and do the Fuck You's of the Week.

963
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:52,060
So why don't you go ahead and send those to me in the chat room.

964
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:53,060
Hello, I'm Skye.

965
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:54,780
I'm sitting in the chat room right now.

966
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:55,780
Huh?

967
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:56,780
Play Angry Thing.

968
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:57,780
Play Angry Thing.

969
01:08:57,780 --> 01:08:58,780
I'm going to play some...

970
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:00,780
I'm going to play...

971
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:01,780
Wait.

972
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:02,780
There's quite a difference between those.

973
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:03,980
I'm going to play Show You.

974
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:05,340
Jamie says, play show tunes.

975
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:06,580
What songs are show tunish?

976
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:11,900
My god, I don't know what songs those are.

977
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:12,900
Can I play angry songs?

978
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:14,840
I can find those easier.

979
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:18,820
OK, I have to play all tack?

980
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:20,340
All right, we'll take a tack break.

981
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:26,420
We'll take a tic-tac break.

982
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:28,500
And then we'll be back.

983
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:29,620
Yes, we will.

984
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:31,220
I have to find some tack stuff first.

985
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:33,020
Hold on.

986
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:37,300
Okay, yes, we're gonna play some tag, and then we'll be back, so send those FUs to me.

987
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:40,940
You rhymed, that was cool. I'm Skye. Tag in bed.

988
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:46,500
I'm in the chat room as Skye. If you aren't in our chat room, you should be. Get your

01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:53,780

01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:59,540
Visit our forums. What? You said chat.

Stelly.

1001
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:49,620
Oh.

1002
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,120
I

1003
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:21,120
Oh

1004
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:26,840
in

1005
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:34,080
ok

1006
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:37,180
it

1007
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:38,560
it

1008
01:15:38,560 --> 01:16:07,560
I'm gonna be a little bit disturbed, guys.

1009
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:12,560
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

1010
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:19,560
Do we care what people think of us?

1011
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:20,560
No!

1012
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:25,560
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

1013
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:26,560
Yeah!

1014
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:31,960
Extreme Bimani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

1015
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:36,280
Hi, we are back now.

1016
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:38,280
oops, sorry about that.

1017
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:40,080
We're having some technical difficulties there.

1018
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,040
Loki and I are trying to share our computers here,

1019
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:44,480
and it's fucking things up.

1020
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:47,040
But we're back.

1021
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:47,800
Yay.

1022
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,720
Yay.

1023
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:51,320
I'm so excited that we're back.

1024
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:54,440
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it.

1025
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:56,400
Let's see.

1026
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:57,880
Jamie, let's talk about Pump It Up,

1027
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:59,200
because Chad wanted us to talk about Pump It Up.

1028
01:16:59,200 --> 01:16:59,680
It's Korean.

1029
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:00,960
And we haven't in a while.

1030
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:01,560
It's Korean.

1031
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:02,000
What do you think?

1032
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:02,680
Do you like it?

1033
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:03,440
You hate it?

1034
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,360
I like it, but it's Korean.

1035
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,360
what's that mean

1036
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:08,140
it's korean

1037
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:11,300
okay i hated the version that was at uh... new york new york

1038
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:13,400
was in vegas oh my god

1039
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:14,680
or personal

1040
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:17,480
the stages so messed up

1041
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:19,640
it kept going past the front i wanted kids

1042
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,500
every time you stepped on it it would hit you

1043
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:25,220
and they're like a bajillion songs in the game is like one of the last ones out

1044
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:26,300
and then

1045
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:29,900
i couldn't find the songs i wanted it took me forever to find one to you

1046
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:33,280
and then i killed automatically due to the difficulty is sucked

1047
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:37,040
But, I mean, I like Pump It Up, though. I hate playing caution on Pump It Up, though.

1048
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,920
Because it's so slow.

1049
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:43,360
Um, my thoughts on Pump It Up, I absolutely hated the game when I first

1050
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:47,420
played it, and I'll tell you why. The interface sucks

1051
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:51,040
on all versions, because they don't- you have to use your feet to move around, and it's

1052
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:52,760
too slow. I mean, I like

1053
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:56,560
on DDR how you can really fastly throw through the songs. Even on 4th Mix, you can move through

1054
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,680
the songs a hell of a lot faster than you can

1055
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:01,400
and pump it up, and that just pisses me off. I shouldn't have to stand there for five minutes

1056
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:02,760
trying to select my song.

1057
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:04,760
i know you can

1058
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:07,400
i mean so whatever but other than that

1059
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:10,800
it's alright i mean the videos in the back of pretty cool i want to take on me

1060
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:14,200
was the best of some of the songs are pretty cool i really like to the songs

1061
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,160
and pump it up

1062
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:18,880
and uh... you know i could be extreme i think it takes a lot of crap

1063
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:23,520
but it's really horrible interface hurts it a lot more than it really should

1064
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:26,020
a lot of people are just turned off by the

1065
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:28,920
it's just not easy to use

1066
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:31,920
That's just if we had DDR on a big screen like that.

1067
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:34,920
I've seen it.

1068
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,920
It'd be pretty.

1069
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,920
No it doesn't.

1070
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,920
Pump It Up does not suck.

1071
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:44,920
Why do you think Pump It Up sucks, Zero?

1072
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:53,920
Well, one reason why I think it absolutely sucks is the interface does suck.

1073
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:58,920
I mean, I can play this, I can play the game, and there's a couple good songs that I like.

1074
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:04,920
Half the other songs are trash, the damn thing takes forever to load after a song.

1075
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:10,920
I gotta stand there for 45 seconds just to take 30 seconds to pick a song.

1076
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:15,920
I don't really like having to, I don't like playing diagonal instead of up and down, left and right.

1077
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:20,920
You know what though, the diagonal thing, for some reason it makes freestyling a lot more natural.

1078
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:21,920
Because it makes you freestyle.

1079
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:25,920
Yeah, but I think that's kind of cool. That's one thing I like about Pump It Up. Yeah, I think that's the point.

1080
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:42,920
I mean, I think DDR could actually use maybe some type of the style of the videos that are in Pump It Up on some, and there's some that are horrible, but I think that there's a lot of ideas DDR can take from Pump.

1081
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,920
The same thing what Pump could take from DDR.

1082
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:55,920
Like, yeah, having just an easier interface, being able to choose your songs quicker, and possibly changing their hardware so that you don't have to stand around for a month.

1083
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,920
Isn't a Pump It Up machine just a big computer inside that box?

1084
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,920
Yeah, that's what I heard. It's just a big PC in there.

1085
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:06,920
They could have changed that if they really wanted to. It would have been a little bit easier for everyone else.

1086
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:08,920
I've played a game that's worse, though.

1087
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:09,920
What?

1088
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,920
And, God, I can't remember the name of it. It was put up by Jalego.

1089
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:17,820
Take no motion not taking motion. No what it is. They have one at this bowling alley. I went to in Hayward

1090
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:19,720
but um

1091
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:25,420
It's got three monitors middle monitors the videos, and it's like it looks like one of those make your own video things

1092
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:29,120
Huh people doing really crappy dances wear really crappy clothes

1093
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:34,580
But it's got like you know how somebody amigo how your maraca places are shut are set up

1094
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:39,560
Well, it's like that on the floor, and you do your steps like that, and they're different colors that tells you where to go

1095
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:40,560
What's that game called?

1096
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:45,560
Is it put out by the people who did Someday We Go?

1097
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:46,560
It's by Jaleco.

1098
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:47,560
Do a search.

1099
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:48,560
Weird.

1100
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,560
Do a search real quick.

1101
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:55,560
Hold on just a sec because I'm queuing up some of the stuff for later in the show.

1102
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:57,220
I missed playing Techno Motion.

1103
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:58,480
They have one at Excalibur.

1104
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:00,480
I missed playing it.

1105
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:03,860
Thank you for bringing that up, Logie.

1106
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:08,500
That's why I wanted to bring up what's cooler than Pump It Up is the game that the same

1107
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:17,120
company made called Dance Station 3DDX and the way it looks is so cool because instead

1108
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:23,300
of the arrows that are set in, you know how the buttons are kind of sunk into the pad

1109
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:24,300
a little bit?

1110
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:30,780
Well, the way 3DDX is, and the same thing with EZDancer, is it's a big black panel that's

1111
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:34,960
over the whole thing and then different areas of it light up so it's a big flat panel.

1112
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:38,240
So it kind of makes finding the buttons a little harder but it kind of adds a challenge

1113
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:42,600
of the game. Well, in 3DDX, not only that, but there's para-like sensors all around the

1114
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:47,320
sides so you have to wave your arms too to play. It's awesome. And it has such songs

1115
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:53,680
as Jenny in a Bottle. And that game makes you freestyle. I got to adjust the volume

1116
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:59,840
on this one. Yes, that game makes you freestyle. I don't talk very loud. Here, look, if you

1117
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:03,400
You can use this one.

1118
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:06,280
Don't change it too much.

1119
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:07,280
What was I looking for?

1120
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:08,280
Shoot.

1121
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:13,280
Hey, they're number one in Italy.

1122
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:16,800
Okay, so are we about ready for the FUs of the week?

1123
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:17,800
Sure.

1124
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:18,800
Why not?

1125
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:19,800
Here we go.

1126
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:22,800
Jamie, you know what to do.

1127
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:44,060
My first one, my first few of the week goes to being tired and not sleeping.

1128
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:52,660
My other one goes toward my poor body for being sore after Rocky last night and I don't

1129
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:55,660
I don't know. I'm not really all that angsty.

1130
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:57,660
Gasp!

1131
01:22:57,660 --> 01:23:04,660
Well, there's the usual, like, the idiot drivers and driving here to do the show.

1132
01:23:04,660 --> 01:23:07,660
Driving to South Sac and run up here.

1133
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:09,660
Love you, Jamie.

1134
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:11,660
He got me food, so he's forgiven.

1135
01:23:11,660 --> 01:23:15,660
I was teasing anyway.

1136
01:23:15,660 --> 01:23:18,660
One of them goes to...

1137
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:22,660
I love my fiance a whole lot, but he ate a whole box of Life cereal and I didn't get any.

1138
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:26,660
Was it Cinnamon Life? Because Cinnamon Life is the best.

1139
01:23:26,660 --> 01:23:28,660
Cinnamon Life sucks, it's normal.

1140
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:30,660
If he ate the whole box of Cinnamon Life, that is a crime.

1141
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:32,660
That's okay, I found another box though.

1142
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:33,660
Because I thought they were super-five.

1143
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:34,660
Cinnamon Life is the show.

1144
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:35,660
I hate Cinnamon Life.

1145
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:37,660
What is wrong with you?

1146
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:42,660
Thank you, Cinnamon Life tastes like shit.

1147
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:44,660
I like the normal one.

1148
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:52,660
I don't like oddly flavored cereals. I like crackle and oat bran. I'll put it that way. I like grape nuts. I like total.

1149
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:58,660
When I was a little kid, I ate adult cereals. And I hate marshmallows. Fuck marshmallows, okay? Because they're nasty.

1150
01:23:58,660 --> 01:24:06,660
And, um... I guess that's it. Yeah, I'm tired. I'm being tired.

1151
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:08,660
Next

1152
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:50,660
I don't know what's wrong with it. It's pissing me off, because I'm looking on their site to find drivers, and they don't have any drivers for this car, because the car doesn't exist according to their site, which is also really annoying.

1153
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:55,660
So, I had to find drivers for this somewhere. I'm thinking that's probably what the problem is for it.

1154
01:24:55,660 --> 01:25:01,260
So I've even my sound card to the sucks also since we're on the subject of that every my motherboard because you know

1155
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:05,660
I like I got this nice motherboard and processor combo. It's supposed to be an AMD

1156
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:11,060
2200 well, it's supposed to be you know, ready about you know, two gigahertz or whatever. It's running at 135

1157
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:20,300
My old processor was faster than that. So I basically paid $300 or no $150 for a downgrade

1158
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:27,300
Thank you, fries. You can suck ass.

1159
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:30,300
Let's also talk about old people.

1160
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:36,300
I had an encounter with this really old bag that was at release,

1161
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:39,300
and I was just waiting in line to get some Chinese food,

1162
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:40,300
and she's pushing her cart.

1163
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:45,300
Oh, I'm old!

1164
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:48,300
Cutting right in front of us, and then stupid Chinese lady,

1165
01:25:48,300 --> 01:26:08,980
Chinese lady she freaking you know and so I'm sitting here going yeah I guess

1166
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:14,980
we don't need lines and the stupid bitch in front me started saying and I just

1167
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:19,380
story jr out there and i think that you're not talking you can you agree

1168
01:26:19,380 --> 01:26:20,860
and then uh...

1169
01:26:20,860 --> 01:26:24,260
so you know i feel a little bit because then she didn't even know she wanted in

1170
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:27,100
your arms when you're on come on come on come on come on move move move move

1171
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:31,000
come on come on come on you're old come on move

1172
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,320
wasted like a good

1173
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:35,980
extra half an hour than i really needed

1174
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:38,400
so now i am also

1175
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:41,660
and at the two uh... stupid drivers

1176
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:43,060
but then it

1177
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:51,060
There's this road down here, and everyone backs up because they want to turn, because it backs up a good half a mile, because people want to turn.

1178
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:56,060
Well, these stupid people don't realize, oh, I have to get in that way to turn? Yeah, well, there would be more there.

1179
01:26:56,060 --> 01:27:01,060
So they stop in the middle of your lane, trying to turn over, and won't move out of the way.

1180
01:27:01,060 --> 01:27:08,060
Then I had another jackass when I went to McDonald's yesterday, who was checking his food in the middle of the parking lot.

1181
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:11,060
direct middle of the parking lot, I couldn't go around him because he was sitting in the way

1182
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:12,060
and he's just kinda going

1183
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:15,060
du-du-du-du-du..

1184
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:20,060
So, I view that

1185
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:23,060
anyway the people on Ain't It Cool News for giving away the ending of The Matrix

1186
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:25,060
they keep trying to read reviews on stuff

1187
01:27:25,060 --> 01:27:28,060
and they keep giving away the end of The Matrix and it's like sneaking up on me

1188
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:30,060
I keep finding out more stuff I don't want to know about it

1189
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:31,060
and it's really annoying

1190
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:34,060
But I only have four more days until I get to go see the movie

1191
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:35,060
which reminds me, uh...

1192
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:36,060
my girlfriend doesn't really want to go

1193
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:37,560
so I have an extra ticket if anyone wants to go with me

1194
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:44,560
go with me

1195
01:27:44,940 --> 01:27:47,920
policy here and by forty five

1196
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:51,400
that's the only thing that's right over there

1197
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:55,240
uh... and then uh... if you to my website

1198
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:56,940
who's gone

1199
01:27:56,940 --> 01:27:58,740
it's gone for good

1200
01:27:58,740 --> 01:28:03,520
no say it's gone my hosting died and i'm not going to pay for hosting and it

1201
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:04,960
it saves me time that way

1202
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:07,440
so i don't have to work on my website anymore

1203
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:10,960
so what, i mean i guess what you know you can just find your web your stupid files

1204
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:14,240
anywhere else on the web because i'm not responsible for doing your searching for

1205
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:14,920
you

1206
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:18,680
i don't give a shit anymore you know because you don't do anything you don't help me out

1207
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:20,400
so um...

1208
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:23,640
you consider a bastard you can go ahead and find your files on the web like i do

1209
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:25,640
and spend time like i do

1210
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:28,200
and you know what it builds character you know

1211
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:31,040
the hard works character

1212
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:36,040
hard work. So if you want a huge sim collection like mine, you can go suck ass because you're

1213
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:39,880
never going to find it because most files are off the internet. So ha, I laugh at you

1214
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:44,880
because I have a large collection and you do, I have a large collection and you do.

1215
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:51,880
So yeah. And um, yeah I have Asian porn. That was cool. But um, I have Asian porn because

1216
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:59,620
it's censored. That sucks. They have hot Asian chicks and they're like all blocky. Looks

1217
01:28:59,620 --> 01:29:06,620
like a mosaic attacking them. That's not cool. So I think I'm done. You know, it's just that

1218
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:11,160
pisses me off that my site's gone, because I really like my site, and you know, but I'm

1219
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:15,520
just not going to know. Maybe I'll come back. You never know, because my friend who does

1220
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:19,400
my hosting for me says that sometimes the web server goes down and it comes back up,

1221
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:22,640
so it may reappear and then everything will be fine, but.

1222
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:27,200
And what do you have to say to those that say that the point of Leech from Loki is to,

1223
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:30,600
who, in fact, leech from Loki.

1224
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:34,960
The point is that I left space for people to put files up so that people can leech from

1225
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:37,680
my site, but no one put any files up.

1226
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:38,680
And for that you must die.

1227
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:43,600
And for that you must die, and I know the whole purpose of getting files, but really

1228
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:47,960
all the files I had on there I got from like DDRUK anyways, so go get them from them.

1229
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:50,360
Shit, this is like, what?

1230
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:54,480
Seriously, Bomani Sims of DDRUK is pretty much where I got all my files, there wasn't

1231
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:59,360
anything new on there yet. I mean, I was planning on it. I just never got around to it. So now

1232
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:04,000
I have more time to make cool files. I mean, you should think of it as like an advantage

1233
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,360
because you get to see my files anyways.

1234
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:06,360
Yeah, more times to remix.

1235
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:10,600
Yeah. Well, yeah, if the sound card works.

1236
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:11,600
Okay, I'm done.

1237
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:13,600
All right, you're done.

1238
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:14,600
My turn.

1239
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:19,080
Let me think. What are some things I want to give an FU to?

1240
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:23,700
My first FU goes to my erratic sleeping schedule because I was a half hour late to work on

1241
01:30:23,700 --> 01:30:48,460
p0k3smot42o

1242
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:53,460
p0k3smot42o p0k3smot42o p0k3smot42o

1243
01:31:18,460 --> 01:31:24,540
my stuff on the counter and it's like floating. I'm like, shit man. I have no idea. I'll keep

1244
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:31,540
track of that. Probably shaving. Actually, I have that problem with Dan. Cause after

1245
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:35,220
he gets out of the bathroom for some reason there's an inch of water on the floor. And

1246
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:40,660
an inch of water on the sink. And I have to grab toilet paper and wipe down the sink.

1247
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:45,300
That's why in my bathroom, even if I get a little bit lax with cleaning off the counter,

1248
01:31:45,300 --> 01:32:01,300
kostjamrh It's probably from shaving, and I probably just don't notice it because I'm in such a hurry in the morning. But I will try to be more conscious of it in the future.

1249
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:22,300
kostjamrh I found out something. The girl who was the onee-san in Battle Royale. She's the voice actor for Asuka in Battle Royale.

1250
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:50,300
kostjamrh Wonderful, your useless tribute fact of the day.

1251
01:32:50,300 --> 01:33:05,300
0 Do you have any FUs today?

1252
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:18,300
1. I was wearing a new shirt

1253
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:39,780
Just waiting to get on a ride and this lady starts smoking in front of me, right?

1254
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:43,360
And I'm sitting here thinking first of all, we are in an enclosed area

1255
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:48,780
which means you're not supposed to be soaking and I didn't say that I just kept to myself and then I told my

1256
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:55,100
My friends who were with me and said, you know, this is like really annoying and she turns around and like screams at me

1257
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:59,500
I don't give a fuck. I can smoke all the fuck. I want blah blah blah and

1258
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:05,260
I said, okay, that's great. I'll actually know she can't I know she can't because she's in an enclosed area

1259
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:12,260
And, um, and there's a security guard sitting next to me, and I told him, and he told her to put it out, and she wouldn't put it out.

1260
01:34:12,260 --> 01:34:17,260
And then she decided to yell at me about my shirt, and saying, what, am I not attractive? And I looked at her, and I said, no.

1261
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:25,260
And she was all, your shirt's very offensive, and I said, your smoking's very offensive, and all your little running around bratty-ass kids are offensive.

1262
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:33,260
And your face is offensive! At that point in which, she decided to try to storm on me, and then the security guard scrapped her, and ejected her from the park.

1263
01:34:33,260 --> 01:34:35,260
That is how you do it!

1264
01:34:35,260 --> 01:34:37,260
And uh...

1265
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:46,260
No, and then I have to say fuck you to all the people at MarineWorld who can't obviously run a fucking ride right.

1266
01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:50,260
Every time something comes in, oh we're out of technical difficulty so you're going to have to wait for another 45 minutes.

1267
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:52,260
They're not drunk, they're just cardies.

1268
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:54,260
They need like pot-smoking cardies.

1269
01:34:54,260 --> 01:34:56,260
And once you like do crank and-

1270
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:58,260
Cardies will make the ride work even if it needs duct tape.

1271
01:34:58,260 --> 01:35:01,260
Do cardies make a ride work if it doesn't work?

1272
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:05,900
they don't care they'll put you on it but so yeah i ended up spending like two hours in this one

1273
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:10,700
line waiting for a stupid ride and i was like two cars just waiting to go and i ended up standing

1274
01:35:10,700 --> 01:35:15,340
there just because i didn't really want to walk and wait in another one um but still fuck you

1275
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:20,220
then for being assholes when you ask them what's wrong you're like i don't know i just pushed the

1276
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:27,660
buttons stupid bastards and then um fuck you to the people what the hell nevermind anyways fuck

1277
01:35:27,660 --> 01:35:34,660
I'd like you to know the people who said that all of you up in Sacramento are all known to absolutely suck at DDR.

1278
01:35:34,660 --> 01:35:40,660
We're the worst DDR players in the world, okay? Because other people say it, it's true.

1279
01:35:40,660 --> 01:35:46,660
Well, I know. They decided to try to tell me this as I go down there and I'm messing around the 4th machine.

1280
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:48,660
Which works perfectly. That's the best place ever.

1281
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:53,660
Yeah, I mean, I'm thinking, what, March Madness? What, 3 or 4 of the top 16 were from Sacramento?

1282
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:55,660
We suck. We really, really suck.

1283
01:36:23,660 --> 01:36:24,660
I know, bastard.

1284
01:36:24,660 --> 01:36:25,660
I didn't know.

1285
01:36:25,660 --> 01:36:29,300
Well, let's have a dance off, and I'm like, what.

1286
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:32,040
First off, first off, first off.

1287
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:33,660
Anyone that calls it a dance off.

1288
01:36:33,660 --> 01:36:34,660
I know.

1289
01:36:34,660 --> 01:36:37,940
Okay, you should've known right there that, well, yeah.

1290
01:36:37,940 --> 01:36:38,940
And I'm gonna say-

1291
01:36:38,940 --> 01:36:40,940
I need not say no more.

1292
01:36:40,940 --> 01:36:42,660
The kid was pretty good, I guess.

1293
01:36:42,660 --> 01:36:47,760
I mean, he did play really well, but I mean for them to sit there and just get done telling

1294
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:51,020
me how much I suck and then wanna challenge me.

1295
01:36:51,020 --> 01:36:52,280
Because of where you're from.

1296
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:53,280
Yeah.

1297
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:55,280
I've never seen you play, just because of where you're from.

1298
01:36:55,280 --> 01:37:03,280
And not to mention, their extreme sucked at that point, because the unlocks were up to sync, and that was it, so none of the really good songs had been unlocked.

1299
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:11,280
And then, um, so they said, alright, we do best two out of three games, and blah blah blah, I'm like, fine, alright.

1300
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:19,280
So, we did the first two rounds, the first two games were PA, and surprisingly I beat them, because I never thought I was that good at PA.

1301
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:25,280
And I beat him by a pretty big margin, and then the second round we just went for, I guess, the overall score of all three songs.

1302
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:34,280
And, um, huh? Basically, yeah. But, I mean, there was some stupid little thing they said, and I said, alright, fine.

1303
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:40,280
And then I beat them, and then they were all pissed off because I won, and, you know, I'm from Sacramento.

1304
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:44,280
And then I came back later, because the guy was going to put in the unlock code, and he did.

1305
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:47,040
Legend of Max is there, and I just wanted to play it.

1306
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:50,040
And then, of course, you know, the happy little winners are there again.

1307
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:55,360
And now, can you beat Legend of Max? I said I'd beat it, like, maybe 2 out of 18, 20 tries.

1308
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:56,200
No.

1309
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:59,280
Okay, um, well, he can beat it all the time. Why don't you challenge him?

1310
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:03,640
I'm like, why would you, basically, why would you want to challenge me if I'm so inferior to him?

1311
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:06,920
And I'll just do it. And I beat it, I think it was, like, with a C or a D.

1312
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:11,400
And he failed it miserably before the freeze, before, like, the first main freeze.

1313
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:18,400
kostjamrh And it was funny when they tried to do doubles, because there was a broom right there where they could have wiped off the machine.

1314
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:49,400
And so they didn't. And I watched all three of them try to play doubles and slide right off the side of the machine onto the fourth plus off of the extreme.

1315
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:57,400
Because they are just too stupid to clean up. And I got up there...neither of them have memory slots.

1316
01:38:57,400 --> 01:39:02,400
But it is still a fourth plus though, which was nice because it was fun to play.

1317
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:10,400
But it's just, you know, if you're going to come up and say people suck and you think they're so bad, don't challenge them to play because they might be better than you.

1318
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:15,400
namagem1 yes, this message has been brought to you by Zero

1319
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:20,400
namagem1 worth his information and kind words for all

1320
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:24,400

1321
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:26,400
namagem1 fuck Marine World dude

1322
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:27,400
namagem1 that place is shitty

1323
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:29,400
namagem1 I wanna go back to Six Flags Magic Mountain where the roller coasters actually worked and it was fun

1324
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:33,400
namagem1 so fuck Vallejo and shit like that and their stupid crap

1325
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:38,400
namagem1 I'm done because it sucks

1326
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:45,400
cpcgamer1- Let's talk to the chat room.

1327
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:48,400
cpcgamer1- Hello chat room.

1328
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:55,400
cpcgamer1- BlackLab would like to give FUs to fucking migraines. They always ruin things for me. I would have been at Rocky last night.

1329
01:39:55,400 --> 01:40:05,400
cpcgamer1- Fuck Easy Mac. I'm sick of it already. There would be more but my roommate finally moved out and I have the room to myself for the next five weeks and that makes me happy.

1330
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:11,400
Stapler X would like to say F you to annoying bitches who can't stay quiet in a fucking screening room.

1331
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:17,400
And of course the president. No reason given, just F you.

1332
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:25,400
Darkdatsui would like to say fuck having to wait for E3 and the official footage of MGS3.

1333
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:32,400
Also he would like to give a suggestion that perhaps the game you were thinking about earlier, Jamie, stepping selection or stepping stage.

1334
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:28,800
p0k3smot42o

1335
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:29,800
kostjamrh

1336
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:30,800
kostjamrh

1337
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:48,800
0blivixx, i think

1338
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:59,800
0blivixx, yeah

1339
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:36,800
Snubdyspenoid would like to say a whole lot, here we go.

1340
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:03,400
hell is with all this Korean crap? Pump It Up, Ragnarok Online, who gives a crap? There's

1341
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:07,920
a bunch of other MMORPGs out there that are much better and much less repetitive and Pump

1342
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:08,920
It Up sex.

1343
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:09,920
Fuck you buddy.

1344
01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:10,920
Would you like to respond to that, Jamie?

1345
01:43:10,920 --> 01:43:13,440
Fuck you buddy. I like Ragnarok Online.

1346
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:14,440
Fuck you.

1347
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:17,320
I have more fun playing it and it's free.

1348
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:21,320
There you go. Free is a good thing.

1349
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:24,240
And my thief is level 26.

1350
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:25,240
I still like that. Fuck you.

1351
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:30,240
kostjamrh And it makes me think of Secret of Mana, so I like it, and all my friends wrote it.

1352
01:43:55,240 --> 01:43:59,100
experiences with Fries, you think that the employees being paid commission would stop

1353
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:04,480
them from being shit-nosed, asshole-sucking, dirty-ass cock-dobblers?

1354
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:08,840
Okay, you know, Fries really does suck, but they actually did something good for me the

1355
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:14,680
other day. And this is like, well, no, they didn't even have any! They were sold out!

1356
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:21,140
No. They actually did a good, they actually did a good job, and actually, you know, sold

1357
01:44:21,140 --> 01:44:26,140
kostjamrh And then at the end of that rant, he said, oh, free.

1358
01:44:56,140 --> 01:44:59,540
You don't know me. You don't know my life. You don't know...

1359
01:44:59,540 --> 01:45:03,540
And who think they know what I'm thinking? You're not psychic, bitches. Go see Miss Cleo.

1360
01:45:03,540 --> 01:45:08,740
And finally, F you to not being able to go to Scandia for lack of money. My skills are slipping, dammit.

1361
01:45:08,740 --> 01:45:09,940
Here's the part where you go,

1362
01:45:09,940 --> 01:45:11,180
WHAT SKILLS?

1363
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:13,740
AHHH! AHHH!

1364
01:45:13,740 --> 01:45:20,580
I'm so mean. You mean his total elite freestyling skills? Must keep passing eights, rar. Okay, out.

1365
01:45:20,580 --> 01:45:21,900
Okay.

1366
01:45:21,900 --> 01:45:23,860
Rock on.

1367
01:45:23,860 --> 01:45:25,400
uh... next

1368
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:27,420
code zero

1369
01:45:27,420 --> 01:45:30,340
would like to ask you to annoying people in the movie theater who must

1370
01:45:30,340 --> 01:45:33,660
blurt out the name of every unit next to even though they are wrong eighty

1371
01:45:33,660 --> 01:45:35,180
percent of the time all

1372
01:45:35,180 --> 01:45:36,420
that reminds me

1373
01:45:36,420 --> 01:45:40,500
all all all occur occur occur

1374
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:41,380
at you

1375
01:45:41,380 --> 01:45:45,100
to that little kid who is sitting behind us next to act like this whole family

1376
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:47,760
they didn't even speak english they spoke russian or something

1377
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:49,400
and like there were three kids

1378
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:52,540
and they would like to shake the seat and stuff and we are just like her own

1379
01:45:52,540 --> 01:45:57,420
stare and be all, what the hell do you think you're doing? They're stupid. They were really

1380
01:45:57,420 --> 01:46:04,180
stupid because they had no idea why I was mad. I hate kids. There should be a law against

1381
01:46:04,180 --> 01:46:10,160
bringing certain age children into a movie theater. I don't realize there are somewhat

1382
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:12,940
laws in R and X, but that should be punishable by death.

1383
01:46:12,940 --> 01:46:16,660
I don't remember what theater I was at, but there was this kid there who was doing that

1384
01:46:16,660 --> 01:46:22,260
to me and her parent was very nice to them. I turned around and I told the mom or something

1385
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:27,260
that if she didn't control her child, I'd report her to child services.

1386
01:46:27,260 --> 01:46:28,260
To child protection services.

1387
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:29,260
And she was like, what?

1388
01:46:29,260 --> 01:46:32,620
I was like, yeah, because it's going to be for neglect because I'm going to take her

1389
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:37,060
child and ship them off to some third world country of slavery.

1390
01:46:37,060 --> 01:46:41,060
And she just looked at me and her child never did it again.

1391
01:46:41,060 --> 01:46:44,860
I just, God, I hate kids, and we need to, you know what I should do?

1392
01:46:44,860 --> 01:46:47,420
I should open up a movie theater where children are banned.

1393
01:46:47,420 --> 01:46:50,740
I'd be the richest fucking man on the planet.

1394
01:46:50,740 --> 01:46:54,740
Our Dave and Busters creation will also have a movie theater in it.

1395
01:46:54,740 --> 01:46:55,740
Yes.

1396
01:46:55,740 --> 01:46:59,740
Yes, we need to, I swear to God, Loki, we need to get alone and make this.

1397
01:46:59,740 --> 01:47:03,740
We need to make our Dave and Busters slash movie theater slash children free world.

1398
01:47:03,740 --> 01:47:05,740
It would be beautiful.

1399
01:47:05,740 --> 01:47:08,740
I would cry tears of joy.

1400
01:47:08,740 --> 01:47:10,740
Poor new land.

1401
01:47:10,740 --> 01:47:12,740
Oh yeah.

1402
01:47:12,740 --> 01:47:14,740
You know what else you need in there?

1403
01:47:14,740 --> 01:47:16,740
You need the Discovery Zone in there with no children.

1404
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:19,740
All those nets and balls and things.

1405
01:47:19,740 --> 01:47:23,740
I used to take my brothers there just so that I could go play.

1406
01:47:23,740 --> 01:47:25,740
Alright, one more F you from the chat room.

1407
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:28,740
I used to take naps in there.

1408
01:47:28,740 --> 01:47:34,740
Rice, ryc3 would like to say fuck you to my computer for buffering too much.

1409
01:47:34,740 --> 01:47:38,740
It means you got to get broadband or if you are on broadband you need to get better broadband I guess.

1410
01:47:38,740 --> 01:47:40,740
More memory.

1411
01:47:40,740 --> 01:47:43,740
That's it. That there completes the F you's of the week.

1412
01:47:43,740 --> 01:47:45,740
Yay.

1413
01:47:45,740 --> 01:47:47,740
I'm so going to go on air.

1414
01:47:47,740 --> 01:47:54,740
dukeofthebump

1415
01:48:17,740 --> 01:48:23,660
So, let us do the cage match.

1416
01:48:23,660 --> 01:48:25,860
That will be fun.

1417
01:48:25,860 --> 01:48:30,380
That will be more fun than a barrel of monkeys.

1418
01:48:30,380 --> 01:48:32,460
Did you find your cage match song, Loki?

1419
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:33,460
Yeah.

1420
01:48:33,460 --> 01:48:34,460
Good.

1421
01:48:34,460 --> 01:48:37,500
Alright, let's go into the orange lounge cage match.

1422
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:44,820
Last week on the orange lounge cage match, a real shocker, I don't know how this song

1423
01:48:44,820 --> 01:48:45,820
won, but it did.

1424
01:48:45,820 --> 01:48:50,820

1429
01:50:12,260 --> 01:50:19,260
I don't know what to do

1430
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:20,260
Hi!

1431
01:50:20,260 --> 01:50:21,260
Hi!

1432
01:50:21,260 --> 01:50:22,260
Hi!

1433
01:50:22,260 --> 01:50:23,260
Hi!

1434
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:24,260
Hi!

1435
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:31,260
when it started rhyming I'd float to the fence

1436
01:51:31,260 --> 01:51:34,260
I could get laid back on your neck patty back

1437
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:36,260
give the dog a bite and now some candy and a back

1438
01:51:36,260 --> 01:51:38,260
roll him over roll him over bake him in the pan

1439
01:51:38,260 --> 01:51:40,260
I'm the little girl that makes the gingerbread man

1440
01:51:40,260 --> 01:51:43,260
understand how big his dickie done you understood

1441
01:51:43,260 --> 01:51:45,260
and you can thank me for sure Mike hot at the jam

1442
01:51:45,260 --> 01:51:47,260
Chris hot at the shop, Lauren hot at the shop

1443
01:51:47,260 --> 01:51:49,260
and Bo got his chick so my piano swing

1444
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:52,660
Prince hollers just drawn outta duck and bowl got his kick

1445
01:51:52,660 --> 01:51:54,160
So I see how they swing

1446
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:55,660
This is what girls are made of

1447
01:51:55,660 --> 01:51:57,860
Sugar and spice and I'm born to slice

1448
01:51:57,860 --> 01:52:00,160
I got no rhymes because we got show

1449
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:02,860
I got no nose because we got no eyes

1450
01:52:02,860 --> 01:52:05,260
But for the women I was like a sock on my back

1451
01:52:05,260 --> 01:52:08,060
I brought a judge in my hands and my pants were slag

1452
01:52:08,060 --> 01:52:36,260
All right, our mics were off during that whole little pass thing.

1453
01:52:36,260 --> 01:52:42,820
Why is the cage match music playing when no one is talking.

1454
01:52:42,820 --> 01:52:46,900
She is on the I love the 80's show every once-in-a- while on VH1.

1455
01:52:46,900 --> 01:52:50,380
Again, that was last week's winner that you just heard a little clip of, Raven Simone.

1456
01:52:50,380 --> 01:52:52,240
We were doing Chris Cross over it in the background.

1457
01:52:52,240 --> 01:52:55,240
She was the youngest girl on the Cosby Show with Thats What Little Girls Are Made Of.

1458
01:52:55,240 --> 01:52:57,340
Thats the first song you can vote for in tonight's cage match.

1459
01:52:57,340 --> 01:53:01,180
That was Raven Simone and Thats What Little Girls Are Made Of.

1460
01:53:01,180 --> 01:53:02,180
All right.

1461
01:53:02,180 --> 01:53:05,500
I wasn't here to rate it, so I gave it 3.

1462
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:34,500
Jamee, when are you going to have time to do more work on the Battle Royale roleplay?

1463
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:37,500
Um, who's that from?

1464
01:53:37,500 --> 01:53:39,500
Uh, puppy.

1465
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:44,500
Puppy? Um, puppy. Um, we'll work on it Tuesday night if I'm not out.

1466
01:53:44,500 --> 01:53:45,500
Okay.

1467
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:47,500
But I'm not gonna be up late because I'm working now.

1468
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:50,500
Okay. Okay, into the cage match. Back to the cage match.

1469
01:53:50,500 --> 01:53:53,500
Loki, what track on the CD do we want here?

1470
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:58,500
Oh, son of a bitch. It's not showing me the...

1471
01:53:58,500 --> 01:53:59,500
Sure.

1472
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:00,500
I know.

1473
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:02,500
It's a, it's a, um, um...

1474
01:54:02,500 --> 01:54:23,500
What's your pick this week?

1475
01:54:32,500 --> 01:54:38,740
which is in four days. Matrix Reloaded is part of the score. It's actually really awesome.

1476
01:54:38,740 --> 01:54:43,700
It's the scene that they're going to be having that kick-ass awesome car chase scene. This

1477
01:54:43,700 --> 01:54:49,740
is also named after a book that came out a while back. It's called Mona Lisa Overdrive.

1478
01:54:49,740 --> 01:54:55,180
It's Juno Reactor and Don Davis. Now, are we really playing the whole ten minutes of

1479
01:54:55,180 --> 01:55:00,180
this? We can play like five to eight minutes. Okay, we're going to play a portion of this

1480
01:55:00,180 --> 01:55:13,180
The edit of it is on my computer, but my sound card sucks ass, so yeah. But because there's an edit of it, that's because I'm doing it for tourneymix 4, so look for that.

1481
01:55:13,180 --> 01:55:20,180
it for Tourney Mix 4, so look for that.

1482
02:02:43,180 --> 02:02:52,180
If it does win, there's going to be an edit put in rotation that's even shorter. It just pretty much has the techno parts of it.

1483
02:02:52,180 --> 02:02:57,180
But it's cool. The edit's really cool. Hopefully we can play the edit for you at the end of the show. We're just having some problems with Logan's computer right now.

1484
02:02:57,180 --> 02:03:02,180
Anyway, let's go around the room and see what people thought, starting with Jenny, because she has the mic.

1485
02:03:02,180 --> 02:03:17,180
It definitely sounded like something that's supposed to go behind something. It wouldn't be something that I would want to listen to over and over and over again, but it didn't suck. It's just not something that I would listen to a lot of, so I'd give it an 8.

1486
02:03:18,180 --> 02:03:19,180
Brad?

1487
02:03:20,180 --> 02:03:21,180
Yeah, Brad and Irene are here.

1488
02:03:22,180 --> 02:03:23,180
Oh, hi Brad and Irene, who got here, by the way.

1489
02:03:23,180 --> 02:03:36,180
I think it was a good song. I kind of agree. It's a soundtrack song. I can't wait to see the movie. I'm sure it's going to kick ass there. But it's a good song. I give it a 9.

1490
02:03:36,180 --> 02:03:39,180
Irene, the rights princess.

1491
02:03:39,180 --> 02:03:50,180
I have a short attention span and it was a long song. It doesn't mean it was bad. It's just hard for me to concentrate on it. Yeah, I know. It's like a freaking long song.

1492
02:03:50,180 --> 02:03:57,180
But, um, it was a good song, like, I mean, for a soundtrack song, I mean, it was good, so I'd give it an 8.

1493
02:03:57,180 --> 02:03:58,180
Mmkay.

1494
02:03:58,180 --> 02:04:00,180
Zero!

1495
02:04:00,180 --> 02:04:05,180
Going by the fact that it's even on the movie, I would give it a 10, but I can't do that because I wouldn't be nice.

1496
02:04:05,180 --> 02:04:10,180
No, actually, it definitely seems like something, yeah, that would be on a movie.

1497
02:04:10,180 --> 02:04:15,180
It's not something that you'd hear anywhere else except the soundtrack or the movie, but I liked it a lot.

1498
02:04:15,180 --> 02:04:20,180
And I actually downloaded it and I think I enjoyed it. I give it like a 9.

1499
02:04:20,180 --> 02:04:22,180
Low-key is what we need to ask.

1500
02:04:22,180 --> 02:04:28,180
It was fucking awesome, dude. I listened to that song, I kid you not, 60 times at least since I've gotten this soundtrack.

1501
02:04:28,180 --> 02:04:33,180
And that was only a couple days ago. And it's awesome driving music. Perfect for driving.

1502
02:04:33,180 --> 02:04:35,180
You just get going and it's like, yeah!

1503
02:04:35,180 --> 02:04:37,180
Your own track real fast.

1504
02:04:37,180 --> 02:04:44,180
No, but it's really awesome. I wish you guys could listen to the whole thing because it does pick up even more afterwards and gets really cool techno-y stuff.

1505
02:04:44,180 --> 02:04:50,180
But like I said before, it is going to be my pick for Turning Mix 4, and you're going to have a pretty good cut of it then.

1506
02:04:50,180 --> 02:04:56,180
But since, you know, it's two minutes and a half, two and a half minutes, it kind of loses some of the stuff, but yeah, really cool. I love it.

1507
02:04:56,180 --> 02:04:59,180
Ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten.

1508
02:04:59,180 --> 02:05:06,180
I really do agree with the sentiment that Jamie kind of started about how it's a soundtrack song, it's kind of in the background.

1509
02:05:06,180 --> 02:05:13,180
But I have an unfair advantage. I've heard that edit that Loki's done, the two and a half minute edit, and he really has taken all the best parts of the song

1510
02:05:13,180 --> 02:05:17,740
song and made it a stand-alone song like he took all the dude like kind of it

1511
02:05:17,740 --> 02:05:21,620
kind of sounds a little tackish actually to me to me I did kind of think that but

1512
02:05:21,620 --> 02:05:25,900
yeah back to the soundtrack thing right actually there's another song and they're

1513
02:05:25,900 --> 02:05:31,300
called just Chateau that does sound like gravity would that be cool if they

1514
02:05:31,300 --> 02:05:34,900
detected the center that'll be it let's do it that is a topic of discussion when

1515
02:05:34,900 --> 02:05:38,340
we come back the money artists we want to see do movie scores but anyway um I

1516
02:05:38,340 --> 02:05:48,340
I think it's a good song. I think the edit's really, really good and that if that goes into rotation it'll be fine, so I give it a 9. It's a good song, it really is.

1517
02:05:48,340 --> 02:05:57,340
But yeah, if I heard all that kind of symphonic stuff during the dance, our normal, the money means more for them, I'd probably go to sleep.

1518
02:05:57,340 --> 02:06:02,340
Well, I think it should be mentioned that I was going to do a remix with that being part of the remix.

1519
02:06:02,340 --> 02:06:08,340
That was supposed to be entered into the remixing contest, which the deadline is tomorrow, but I don't think that's going to happen.

1520
02:06:08,340 --> 02:06:13,340
But I was planning on doing a remix of it.

1521
02:06:13,340 --> 02:06:16,340
Alright, let's get into Jamie's pick. Jamie, what did you bring to the table tonight?

1522
02:06:16,340 --> 02:06:22,340
Mine's old. I couldn't think of anything else again, so I just picked Herbie Hancock Rocket.

1523
02:06:22,340 --> 02:06:24,340
And this is from a game, isn't it?

1524
02:06:24,340 --> 02:06:27,180
Well, they did different versions of Amplitude.

1525
02:06:27,180 --> 02:06:30,340
Okay, but this is a cool song, so here's your last pick for tonight.

1526
02:06:30,340 --> 02:06:37,340
This is Herbie Hancock with Rocket.

1527
02:08:30,340 --> 02:08:37,340
Fuck you.

1528
02:08:37,340 --> 02:08:44,340
Fuck you.

1529
02:08:44,340 --> 02:08:51,340
Fuck you.

1530
02:08:51,340 --> 02:08:58,340
Fuck you.

1531
02:09:58,340 --> 02:10:05,340
Uh huh.

1532
02:10:05,340 --> 02:10:12,340
Uh huh.

1533
02:10:12,340 --> 02:10:19,340
Uh huh.

1534
02:10:19,340 --> 02:10:26,340
Uh huh.

1535
02:11:56,340 --> 02:12:09,900
Alrighty, that was Herbie Hancock with Rocket.

1536
02:12:09,900 --> 02:12:12,180
Hope you all enjoyed that one.

1537
02:12:12,180 --> 02:12:16,060
Let's go around and see what everyone else thought of Herbie Hancock, Rocket.

1538
02:12:16,060 --> 02:12:17,620
Starting off with Jamie.

1539
02:12:17,620 --> 02:12:18,620
Ten.

1540
02:12:18,620 --> 02:12:21,460
You want to give any reasons why?

1541
02:12:21,460 --> 02:12:22,460
Ten.

1542
02:12:22,460 --> 02:12:23,460
Alright.

1543
02:12:23,460 --> 02:12:27,460
I'll take that as a no. Irene, what do you think?

1544
02:12:27,460 --> 02:12:30,460
I liked it a lot. I liked it a lot. 9.

1545
02:12:30,460 --> 02:12:33,460
Alright. Loki.

1546
02:12:33,460 --> 02:12:38,460
That was alright. Reminds me of Breakin', so give it 8.

1547
02:12:38,460 --> 02:12:41,460
Zero, what did you think of Herbie Hancock Rocket?

1548
02:12:41,460 --> 02:12:43,460
What don't I think of that song?

1549
02:12:43,460 --> 02:12:53,460
No, actually, that is the second song of the 80s I remember, besides that super happy stalker song by The Police.

1550
02:12:53,460 --> 02:12:58,460
But I give that song a 10, just because it's been a favorite of mine forever.

1551
02:12:58,460 --> 02:13:00,460
Brad, do you have anything you want to say?

1552
02:13:00,460 --> 02:13:02,460
10. Brad gives it a 10.

1553
02:13:02,460 --> 02:13:04,460
Brad throws a 10 out through the door.

1554
02:13:04,460 --> 02:13:16,460
I like that song, it's pretty cool. If they ever did like a 2DX classic version or something and like brought back a bunch of old 80's songs, I would cry my eyes out if that was not in it.

1555
02:13:16,460 --> 02:13:26,460
I'm working on a file for the 2DX simulators for that song, and for DDR.

1556
02:13:26,460 --> 02:13:28,460
So I give that like an eight and a half.

1557
02:13:28,460 --> 02:13:29,460
Eight and a half?

1558
02:13:29,460 --> 02:13:30,460
Eight and a half.

1559
02:13:30,460 --> 02:13:31,460
Eight and a half.

1560
02:13:31,460 --> 02:13:32,460
Eight and a half. Didn't you play it?

1561
02:14:02,460 --> 02:14:03,460
It's hooked up now.

1562
02:15:02,460 --> 02:15:06,460
tonight's cage match. It's a raving, moaning cock.

1563
02:15:06,460 --> 02:15:10,460
No, it's a cock rocket.

1564
02:15:10,460 --> 02:15:14,460
Only on Orange Lounge Radio do you get the

1565
02:15:14,460 --> 02:15:18,460
raving, moaning cock rocket here on the cage match.

1566
02:15:18,460 --> 02:15:22,460
Weee-haaa-boom.

1567
02:15:22,460 --> 02:15:26,460
You know what's funny about Asian porn? What? It looks like Legos have execs.

1568
02:15:26,460 --> 02:15:30,460
Why do you say that? You have to explain that for those who may not have seen Asian porn.

1569
02:15:30,460 --> 02:15:37,460
It's all blocked out and stuff, because they're Japanese laws, like no private parts can be shown.

1570
02:15:37,460 --> 02:15:40,460
So it just looks like a bunch of Legos having sex.

1571
02:15:40,460 --> 02:15:44,460
Based on the American invasion of the Aztec.

1572
02:15:47,460 --> 02:15:51,460
It's Aztec sex, baby. Oh yeah. Go mosaic.

1573
02:15:51,460 --> 02:15:54,460
The law is actually passed because I'm American.

1574
02:15:54,460 --> 02:15:58,460
It's because we have Asian fever.

1575
02:15:58,460 --> 02:16:03,800
fever. We want that Asian punani. And we have to import it like nuts. And the Japanese are

1576
02:16:03,800 --> 02:16:09,640
getting jealous because, you know, the Japanese men stand a chance against us American men.

1577
02:16:09,640 --> 02:16:16,600
And so, they don't want us taking their women away from them. And so, despite us, they censor

1578
02:16:16,600 --> 02:16:17,600
their porn.

1579
02:16:17,600 --> 02:16:21,600
Oh, we're doing this one way.

1580
02:16:21,600 --> 02:16:24,600
Um, great, dead airspace here.

1581
02:16:24,600 --> 02:16:29,600
Sorry, I'm starting to tally up some of the votes here, so...

1582
02:16:29,600 --> 02:16:32,600
No, you guys missed the philosophical message of the day.

1583
02:16:32,600 --> 02:16:34,600
Uh-oh, what was that?

1584
02:16:34,600 --> 02:16:38,600
Life is a sexually transmitted fatal disease that's also hereditary.

1585
02:16:38,600 --> 02:16:43,600
After your mom gave blowjobs at a truck stop.

1586
02:16:43,600 --> 02:16:46,600
I said after your mom gave blowjobs at a truck stop.

1587
02:16:46,600 --> 02:16:51,600
He downloaded the mall blowjobs.

1588
02:16:51,600 --> 02:16:53,600
No, no, no.

1589
02:16:53,600 --> 02:16:56,600
It was like street blowjobs.

1590
02:16:56,600 --> 02:17:03,600
It's this guy with this camera and his glasses and he convinces some girl to give him a blowjob, supposedly.

1591
02:17:03,600 --> 02:17:05,600
Yeah, also.

1592
02:17:05,600 --> 02:17:07,600
I...well...shh!

1593
02:17:07,600 --> 02:17:09,600
You lie!

1594
02:17:09,600 --> 02:17:11,600
Your scene's all set. Next thing you're probably going to be seeing is,

1595
02:17:11,600 --> 02:17:18,600
The amazing flying microphone.

1596
02:17:18,600 --> 02:17:20,600
Bad catch.

1597
02:17:20,600 --> 02:17:25,600
No, wrestling is not fake. It's real. Real fake.

1598
02:17:25,600 --> 02:17:28,600
You funny.

1599
02:17:28,600 --> 02:17:33,600
Looks like Jamie's going to go off the turnbuckle with the elbow there.

1600
02:17:33,600 --> 02:17:36,600
She's slapping her elbow.

1601
02:17:36,600 --> 02:17:41,600
Alright, last call for votes in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match. In the meantime, let's take a quick break.

1602
02:17:41,600 --> 02:17:42,600
Vote, bitches.

1603
02:17:42,600 --> 02:17:44,600
What do we want to do when we come back from the break?

1604
02:17:44,600 --> 02:17:45,600
Polka.

1605
02:17:45,600 --> 02:17:46,600
Polka?

1606
02:17:46,600 --> 02:17:52,600
Oh, yeah, yeah, we're going to do that topic about Bemani artists and soundtracks and movies they should have done.

1607
02:17:52,600 --> 02:17:56,600
Nah, it's too weird to be a listless, but we could do a listless.

1608
02:17:56,600 --> 02:17:59,600
But then again, I'm too lazy to get paper, so we'll just talk.

1609
02:17:59,600 --> 02:18:01,600
Oh, never mind.

1610
02:18:01,600 --> 02:18:02,600
Never mind.

1611
02:18:02,600 --> 02:18:04,600
Alright, fine.

1612
02:18:04,600 --> 02:18:05,600
Fine.

1613
02:18:05,600 --> 02:18:07,600
Okay, last call for Cage Match, folks.

1614
02:18:07,600 --> 02:18:09,600
That was lunch.

1615
02:18:09,600 --> 02:18:11,600
I'll play it later.

1616
02:18:11,600 --> 02:18:17,600
Alright, we'll be back after this quick break featuring, um...

1617
02:18:17,600 --> 02:18:21,600
Oh, I don't know. What kind of song should I play here?

1618
02:18:21,600 --> 02:18:22,600
Cal Snyder Remixed by...

1619
02:18:22,600 --> 02:18:25,600
Oh, let's do something. I should do something from EX3.

1620
02:18:25,600 --> 02:18:30,600
Dance Mania EX3 was out a couple weeks ago and I got a copy of it. Thank you.

1621
02:18:30,600 --> 02:18:34,600
And we'll play...

1622
02:18:34,600 --> 02:18:49,600
I'm a little yellow fish in the deep blue sea Won't somebody help me?

1623
02:18:49,600 --> 02:19:02,600
I'm a little yellow fish in the deep blue sea Won't somebody help me?

1624
02:19:02,600 --> 02:19:18,160
Do you wanna know how livin' this in me's the way?

1625
02:19:18,160 --> 02:19:25,160
Do you wanna know how everything I knew was changed?

1626
02:19:25,160 --> 02:19:32,160
It was just like a big commotion I just had a couple magic oceans

1627
02:19:32,160 --> 02:19:35,160
The regal was with, slightly damaged

1628
02:19:35,160 --> 02:19:38,660
I was a fish, help me

1629
02:19:38,660 --> 02:19:42,660
I'm a little yellow fish in the deep blue sea

1630
02:19:42,660 --> 02:19:45,660
Won't somebody help me

1631
02:19:45,660 --> 02:19:50,160
I'm a little yellow fish in the deep blue sea

1632
02:19:50,160 --> 02:19:53,160
Won't somebody save me

1633
02:19:56,660 --> 02:19:59,160
Do you wanna take a whale pass

1634
02:19:59,160 --> 02:20:04,160
Do you wanna meet a stupid shot?

1635
02:20:04,160 --> 02:20:07,160
Do you wanna ride the steel or so high?

1636
02:20:07,160 --> 02:20:11,160
Did it always survive?

1637
02:20:11,160 --> 02:20:15,160
It isn't such a big commotion

1638
02:20:15,160 --> 02:20:18,160
All you need is magic motion

1639
02:20:18,160 --> 02:20:20,160
And with a wriggle and twist

1640
02:20:20,160 --> 02:20:22,160
It's such a big fish

1641
02:20:22,160 --> 02:20:23,160
You're a fish!

1642
02:20:23,160 --> 02:20:25,160
Help me!

1643
02:20:25,160 --> 02:20:29,460
I'm a little yellow fish in the deep blue sea

1644
02:20:29,460 --> 02:20:40,560
Won't somebody help me?

1645
02:20:40,560 --> 02:20:53,560
Help me, help me, I need a remedy

1646
02:20:53,560 --> 02:20:57,560
When the strings of the night are in your sight

1647
02:20:57,560 --> 02:21:00,560
You won't believe the things you see

1648
02:21:00,560 --> 02:21:04,560
This world's only way to last time

1649
02:21:04,560 --> 02:21:07,560
If you don't wanna feel like it

1650
02:21:07,560 --> 02:21:11,560
I'm a little yellow fish in the deep blue sea

1651
02:21:11,560 --> 02:21:14,560
Won't somebody help me?

1652
02:21:14,560 --> 02:21:18,560
I'm a little yellow fish in the deep blue sea

1653
02:21:18,560 --> 02:21:22,560
Won't somebody, somebody help me?

1654
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:26,060
Little Little Fish in the deep blue sea

1655
02:21:26,060 --> 02:21:29,060
Somebody save me

1656
02:21:29,060 --> 02:21:33,560
I'm Little Little Fish in the deep blue sea

1657
02:21:33,560 --> 02:21:36,560
Won't somebody save me?

1658
02:21:36,560 --> 02:21:38,560
Save me!

1659
02:21:42,560 --> 02:21:46,060
1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 7

1660
02:21:46,060 --> 02:21:49,560
All the rest can go away

1661
02:21:49,560 --> 02:22:05,560
So little time, so many months, yet it never seems enough.

1662
02:22:05,560 --> 02:22:12,560
So many people passing by me and so few are made out of the right stuff.

1663
02:22:12,560 --> 02:22:18,560
There seems to be a shortage of heroes.

1664
02:22:18,560 --> 02:22:24,560
There ain't enough ones or too many zeros

1665
02:22:24,560 --> 02:22:28,560
One, two, three, four, oh, oh, seven

1666
02:22:28,560 --> 02:22:32,560
All the good guys go to heaven

1667
02:22:32,560 --> 02:22:34,560
Five, six, seven, eight

1668
02:22:34,560 --> 02:22:35,560
Hey, hey!

1669
02:22:35,560 --> 02:22:38,560
All the rest of them go away

1670
02:22:38,560 --> 02:22:42,560
One, two, three, four, oh, oh, seven

1671
02:22:42,560 --> 02:22:45,560
All the good guys go to heaven

1672
02:22:45,560 --> 02:23:10,880
One, two, three, four, oh, oh, seven.

1673
02:23:10,880 --> 02:23:13,920
Before that, help I'm a fish by Creamy and really fast, we're still in the middle of

1674
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:22,080
a break here but Irene would you share your bean burrito theory I came up with

1675
02:23:22,080 --> 02:23:26,320
the bean burrito theory a couple years ago when I heard that song the one two

1676
02:23:26,320 --> 02:23:33,240
three four oh seven because artists some artists on DDR they just pull random

1677
02:23:33,240 --> 02:23:39,000
themes or just random words and put them together in a song and it just sounds

1678
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:42,880
stupid like you know and the reason I came up with bean burrito is just like

1679
02:23:42,880 --> 02:23:49,420
Oh, you know, hey, I'm hungry. Oh bean burrito. La la la. It's just like it's stupid. Yeah bean

1680
02:23:51,520 --> 02:23:58,720
Moly sour cream and extra cheese. I haven't thought up any other let's get that GDR

1681
02:24:00,520 --> 02:24:02,960
It's the Mexican version he's seeing that one more time

1682
02:24:04,080 --> 02:24:06,080
bean burrito

1683
02:24:06,080 --> 02:24:10,920
guacamole, sour cream, and extra cheese.

1684
02:24:10,920 --> 02:24:12,960
I'm going to punch you.

1685
02:24:12,960 --> 02:24:15,400
Rob, you're a dork.

1686
02:24:15,400 --> 02:24:18,080
I just want an extra clean copy of that for any remixes we

1687
02:24:18,080 --> 02:24:18,600
might plan.

1688
02:24:18,600 --> 02:24:19,120
Thank you.

1689
02:24:19,120 --> 02:24:20,200
Oh, you're welcome.

1690
02:24:20,200 --> 02:24:23,160
OK, well, let's look at Crash here.

1691
02:24:23,160 --> 02:24:24,400
I'm going to go my way.

1692
02:24:24,400 --> 02:24:26,320
Come with me, you mothers.

1693
02:24:26,320 --> 02:24:28,280
Let's go.

1694
02:24:28,280 --> 02:24:30,720
One, two, three, four, five.

1695
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:32,120
Break the doll and get out of here.

1696
02:24:32,120 --> 02:24:33,000
Come with me now.

1697
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:34,720
Now we're all going our way.

1698
02:24:34,720 --> 02:24:35,520
Makes no sense.

1699
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:42,160
I want to show you baby the world that you've never seen because it can happen now, so hold

1700
02:24:42,160 --> 02:24:43,560
you tight babe.

1701
02:24:43,560 --> 02:24:45,240
Just pick any Eurobeat song.

1702
02:24:45,240 --> 02:24:46,800
Let's see here.

1703
02:24:46,800 --> 02:24:51,040
Any Eurobeat song.

1704
02:24:51,040 --> 02:24:55,960
I don't want to know what they say, no, no, I don't care, they can tell me nothing, I'm

1705
02:24:55,960 --> 02:24:56,960
going to go my way.

1706
02:24:56,960 --> 02:25:01,600
Wait, you're not doing it right, it's I don't want to know, it's like Mr. Spanky singing.

1707
02:25:01,600 --> 02:25:07,600
Well, you know, I don't want my voice being made into some sort of DWI, so obviously I'm not going to do it with any rhythm.

1708
02:25:07,600 --> 02:25:09,600
We really don't need to hear it all, Matt.

1709
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:12,600
Hey, we're still in break time!

1710
02:25:12,600 --> 02:25:15,600
Come on, go on, and fall apart. Let's go. Ah.

1711
02:25:15,600 --> 02:25:16,600
Ah!

1712
02:25:16,600 --> 02:25:24,600
Ah, alright. Back to break. I'm going to play this. This is something that Justin's working on. It's a world premiere. It's an original piece.

1713
02:25:24,600 --> 02:25:27,600
And he's even calling himself different names now, too. This is pretty funny.

1714
02:25:27,600 --> 02:25:28,600
This is pretty funny.

1715
02:25:28,600 --> 02:25:30,160
He's calling himself Hyper Orchestra.

1716
02:25:30,160 --> 02:25:34,080
So this is Hyper Orchestra with Musette in D. This is a little sample.

1717
02:25:34,080 --> 02:25:35,880
It's a work in progress.

1718
02:25:35,880 --> 02:25:39,480
And then after that, we're going to hear a request that Jamie wants you all to hear.

1719
02:25:39,480 --> 02:25:41,480
So, we shall do that.

1720
02:26:09,480 --> 02:26:11,480
Oh

1721
02:26:39,480 --> 02:26:43,480
You're gonna see me die

1722
02:26:46,480 --> 02:26:51,480
Drowning in the dark

1723
02:26:54,480 --> 02:26:57,480
Where were you to hold my hand

1724
02:26:57,480 --> 02:27:00,480
To the things that we had planned

1725
02:27:00,480 --> 02:27:03,480
Yes, I need you by my side

1726
02:27:03,480 --> 02:27:05,480
When things go crazy

1727
02:27:05,480 --> 02:27:08,480
I just need to know you here

1728
02:27:08,480 --> 02:27:11,360
Can't we see that you'll see this

1729
02:27:11,360 --> 02:27:14,160
When I wake up in the night

1730
02:27:14,160 --> 02:27:16,960
Will you be my guiding light

1731
02:27:16,960 --> 02:27:21,600
I don't care how far I'll take a place tonight

1732
02:27:22,560 --> 02:27:27,120
Tell me where you are and everything's gonna be alright

1733
02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:29,520
Like a shooting star

1734
02:27:30,240 --> 02:27:32,720
Running in the sky

1735
02:27:32,720 --> 02:27:38,220
Wanna fly, just to be with you tonight

1736
02:27:38,220 --> 02:27:43,720
I can shoot it down, across the midnight sky

1737
02:27:43,720 --> 02:27:50,720
Want to fly, just to be with you tonight.

1738
02:28:13,720 --> 02:28:20,720
A and the number 59.

1739
02:28:43,720 --> 02:28:44,720
I'm sorry, Zero?

1740
02:28:44,720 --> 02:28:45,720
Huh?

1741
02:28:45,720 --> 02:28:46,720
I didn't say anything.

1742
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:47,720
I thought you said anyone.

1743
02:28:47,720 --> 02:28:48,720
I just said death.

1744
02:28:48,720 --> 02:28:49,720
But anyway.

1745
02:28:49,720 --> 02:28:50,720
What's death?

1746
02:28:50,720 --> 02:28:51,720
Burritos.

1747
02:28:51,720 --> 02:28:52,720
Chicken.

1748
02:28:52,720 --> 02:29:02,160
Okay, so while they play nachos, vinyl over there, the winner of tonight's cage match,

1749
02:29:02,160 --> 02:29:03,880
by the way, can we get a big drumroll?

1750
02:29:03,880 --> 02:29:06,040
I'm gonna use this next week.

1751
02:29:06,040 --> 02:29:10,320
Okay, the winner is Mona Lisa Overdrive won the cage match.

1752
02:29:10,320 --> 02:29:11,320
Yay.

1753
02:29:11,320 --> 02:29:12,320
Of course.

1754
02:29:12,320 --> 02:29:18,240
can use that next week, Jamie. But, this is the first week I can remember in a long, long

1755
02:29:18,240 --> 02:29:23,680
time where every song did get at least one vote. Usually my picks don't even get a vote,

1756
02:29:23,680 --> 02:29:29,240
but tonight every song at least got one vote. It's Raven Symone. Everyone's a winner. At

1757
02:29:29,240 --> 02:29:35,120
least two votes, no. Everybody loves a seven year old. Raven Symone was not lucky enough

1758
02:29:35,120 --> 02:29:38,920
I have to get two votes tonight.

1759
02:29:38,920 --> 02:29:41,520
Stop putting on Raven Simone, she sucks.

1760
02:29:41,520 --> 02:29:42,520
Sucks!

1761
02:29:42,520 --> 02:29:44,360
I didn't vote her as the winner last week.

1762
02:29:44,360 --> 02:29:47,720
You guys voted her as the winner?

1763
02:29:47,720 --> 02:29:49,720
I'm dismayed.

1764
02:29:49,720 --> 02:29:51,680
Our listeners suck.

1765
02:29:51,680 --> 02:29:53,260
Why are you dismayed?

1766
02:29:53,260 --> 02:29:54,920
Because Rocket owns you.

1767
02:29:54,920 --> 02:29:55,920
Because what?

1768
02:29:55,920 --> 02:29:56,920
Rocket owns.

1769
02:29:56,920 --> 02:29:59,920
Rocket does own, and it did get a good reaction, but unfortunately you just got beat by the

1770
02:29:59,920 --> 02:30:01,200
Matrix like everything else.

1771
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:03,000
Who'd be on the Matrix?

1772
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:10,000
I don't believe in the Matrix. Watch me bend this spoon with the power of my mind.

1773
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:15,000
I'll hack the world!

1774
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:30,800
Anyway, more topics. Like promised earlier, we wanted to talk about movies that Bemani

1775
02:30:30,800 --> 02:30:35,080
artists should do soundtracks too. Now this could be like upcoming sequels, or just like

1776
02:30:35,080 --> 02:30:37,760
ideas for films, or movies in the past that would have been cooler with it.

1777
02:30:37,760 --> 02:30:40,960
X-Men movie, TAC. X-Men movie with a TAC soundtrack?

1778
02:30:40,960 --> 02:30:43,560
Matrix with TAC. Matrix with TAC?

1779
02:30:43,560 --> 02:30:46,600
Babes in Toyland featuring TAC. Is there any movie you wouldn't want to see

1780
02:30:46,600 --> 02:30:53,200
TAC doing in the soundtrack too? Um, Secchi movies.

1781
02:30:53,200 --> 02:30:57,080
Yes, Loki. Uh oh.

1782
02:30:57,080 --> 02:31:06,680
Glitter 2 featuring Paul Eteri That was cute, he did a little happy hop

1783
02:31:06,680 --> 02:31:14,000
He did a little happy hopper I bought Orange Lounge, the band, doing a

1784
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:18,880
soundtrack to a porno French porno

1785
02:31:18,880 --> 02:31:25,880
to

1786
02:31:26,680 --> 02:31:30,300
that would be funny and you know it

1787
02:31:30,300 --> 02:31:34,080
yet i could see talk i do like a really epic kind of film

1788
02:31:34,080 --> 02:31:38,140
talker do like an epic i was thinking like a summer kabadda

1789
02:31:38,140 --> 02:31:42,440
that would be cool to do you know i feel like zero says a gothic porno

1790
02:31:42,440 --> 02:31:44,840
kabadda doing rpg music

1791
02:31:44,840 --> 02:31:54,840
Well, I don't know if anybody listening knows this for a fact, but since it is Konami, Metal Gear Solid, I don't know, maybe.

1792
02:31:54,840 --> 02:32:01,840
But Red Nikita does remind me of Metal Gear Solid, kind of, so maybe that he actually had some actual production in the music of Metal Gear Solid in some way.

1793
02:32:01,840 --> 02:32:11,840
One thing for my Metal Gear Solid CD that I have, there's the theme song remix by Quadra from the end.

1794
02:32:11,840 --> 02:32:13,840
And you know Quadra did Five Key stuff?

1795
02:32:41,840 --> 02:32:43,840
And yes, he is back in it.

1796
02:32:43,840 --> 02:32:45,840
So they might as well see that.

1797
02:32:45,840 --> 02:32:48,840
They might as well dig, of course, the Bane bad guy is supposed to be a kuna.

1798
02:32:48,840 --> 02:32:50,840
Oh my god, oh my god, is Kylie Minogue going to be back in it?

1799
02:32:50,840 --> 02:32:51,840
I would.

1800
02:32:51,840 --> 02:32:52,840
That would be the best.

1801
02:32:52,840 --> 02:32:53,840
She better be.

1802
02:32:53,840 --> 02:32:54,840
That'll be the only reason.

1803
02:32:54,840 --> 02:32:55,840
I know, she has a career now.

1804
02:32:55,840 --> 02:32:57,840
I'm the Green Fairy.

1805
02:32:57,840 --> 02:32:59,840
No.

1806
02:32:59,840 --> 02:33:01,840
Break-In 3.

1807
02:33:01,840 --> 02:33:03,840
Featuring Good Cool.

1808
02:33:03,840 --> 02:33:06,840
That would be awesome.

1809
02:33:06,840 --> 02:33:08,840
What's this in the VCR right now?

1810
02:33:08,840 --> 02:33:10,840
We're watching Break-In.

1811
02:33:10,840 --> 02:33:14,840
The only break-in movie I'd ever seen was the sequel, Breakin' 2 Electric Googaloo.

1812
02:33:14,840 --> 02:33:15,840
Is it Breakdancing?

1813
02:33:15,840 --> 02:33:17,840
Breakdancing. It's done in 82, 83.

1814
02:33:17,840 --> 02:33:20,840
Nice. I like that.

1815
02:33:20,840 --> 02:33:21,840
I like that.

1816
02:33:21,840 --> 02:33:25,840
Here's a cute joke. Here's a cute joke. This is from the chatroom.

1817
02:33:25,840 --> 02:33:28,840
Terminator 2DX with Tran as Terminator.

1818
02:33:28,840 --> 02:33:30,840
Yes, but if you've ever heard...

1819
02:33:30,840 --> 02:33:32,840
Alien Tran for Tran.

1820
02:33:32,840 --> 02:33:35,840
Have you ever seen the Terminator movie, guys?

1821
02:33:35,840 --> 02:33:37,840
I mean the music is like

1822
02:33:41,540 --> 02:33:43,380
It's just a bunch of weird sound effects

1823
02:33:43,380 --> 02:33:49,100
It's like the guy pressed on his keyboard a couple times and said here. This is a soundtrack have you ever seen them?

1824
02:33:49,260 --> 02:33:50,940
Have you ever seen the Mr.

1825
02:33:50,940 --> 02:33:57,940
Science theater 3000 version of pod people where they're doing their new age music now put put your hand

1826
02:33:58,060 --> 02:34:00,060
Okay, now put your finger on this key

1827
02:34:00,940 --> 02:34:04,780
Now you're playing new age key. Okay now put two fingers on there now

1828
02:34:04,780 --> 02:34:09,780
I remember playing a New Age chord. Now hold it down until you get a record label.

1829
02:34:09,780 --> 02:34:12,780
And hold it down until you...

1830
02:34:12,780 --> 02:34:14,780
It was hilarious.

1831
02:34:14,780 --> 02:34:17,780
Back to the soundtracks idea. I'm thinking of like a scary movie.

1832
02:34:17,780 --> 02:34:20,780
Let's say The Ring 2, because you know they're going to do a sequel to The Ring,

1833
02:34:20,780 --> 02:34:22,780
based off one of the Japanese movies.

1834
02:34:22,780 --> 02:34:26,780
Like, Ringu 2. How about Akira Yamaka doing the soundtrack?

1835
02:34:26,780 --> 02:34:28,780
Dude, he did the soundtracks for Silent Hill.

1836
02:34:28,780 --> 02:34:31,780
Some of the creepiest games ever.

1837
02:34:31,780 --> 02:34:38,780
I went on a road trip once and my friend Garrett drove me out to these roads that are not lit very well, so it's like a scary place.

1838
02:34:38,780 --> 02:34:43,780
There's all these trees and railroad tracks that are all abandoned and stuff.

1839
02:34:43,780 --> 02:34:46,780
And we played Silent Hill while driving through there, it was scary.

1840
02:34:46,780 --> 02:34:47,780
The music, the soundtrack?

1841
02:34:47,780 --> 02:34:48,780
Yes.

1842
02:34:48,780 --> 02:34:49,780
Oh my god.

1843
02:34:49,780 --> 02:34:52,780
Because it really messed up. I've never really heard Silent Hill music before because I've never played the game.

1844
02:34:52,780 --> 02:34:54,780
It kind of sounds like post-head, I think.

1845
02:34:54,780 --> 02:34:58,780
I was really surprised. It doesn't sound like anything Kiriyama has done in 2DX.

1846
02:34:58,780 --> 02:35:00,780
Nope, not really.

1847
02:35:00,780 --> 02:35:04,780
The name of Silent Hill sounds like Sour Time.

1848
02:35:04,780 --> 02:35:09,780
Yeah, the Portishead song, because it's got that guitar or ukulele or whatever they were doing.

1849
02:35:22,780 --> 02:35:25,780
Hey, we love dead air here at Orange Lounge.

1850
02:35:25,780 --> 02:35:27,780
Sorry, I've been reading private messages.

1851
02:35:27,780 --> 02:35:31,780
There's a really funny one I'll have to share with you guys off air.

1852
02:35:31,780 --> 02:35:36,780
Insect zero agent porn one.

1853
02:35:36,780 --> 02:35:39,780
The boob...

1854
02:35:39,780 --> 02:35:41,780
The misshapen boob chick killed the bug.

1855
02:35:41,780 --> 02:35:44,780
Any other soundtrack ideas?

1856
02:35:44,780 --> 02:35:49,780
Yeah, we can have True Kiss Destination doing...

1857
02:35:49,780 --> 02:35:52,780
The Haul's World 2.

1858
02:35:52,780 --> 02:35:55,780
What the hell?

1859
02:35:55,780 --> 02:35:58,780
Um, yeah, I got it this time. I caught the mic.

1860
02:35:58,780 --> 02:35:59,780
Argin has one.

1861
02:35:59,780 --> 02:36:03,780
Deval doing Disney?

1862
02:36:03,780 --> 02:36:05,780
Like, what Disney movie?

1863
02:36:05,780 --> 02:36:07,780
I don't know.

1864
02:36:07,780 --> 02:36:11,780
Deval doing Disney, like doing them.

1865
02:36:11,780 --> 02:36:16,780
As the chat room suggested during Help I'm a Fish, that should be in Finding Nemo, the new movie coming out.

1866
02:36:16,780 --> 02:36:19,780
You know what? No.

1867
02:36:19,780 --> 02:36:24,780
Enemy Zero, featuring Desrow.

1868
02:36:24,780 --> 02:36:27,780
that you made me watch, with the aliens?

1869
02:36:27,780 --> 02:36:28,780
Oh, Wild Zero?

1870
02:36:28,780 --> 02:36:29,780
Wild Zero, yeah.

1871
02:36:29,780 --> 02:36:30,780
Featuring Desrow.

1872
02:36:30,780 --> 02:36:32,780
Any trauma film featuring Desrow?

1873
02:36:32,780 --> 02:36:33,780
No.

1874
02:36:33,780 --> 02:36:34,780
How about who?

1875
02:36:34,780 --> 02:36:36,780
No, I think Guitar Wolf.

1876
02:36:36,780 --> 02:36:37,780
Orange Lounge?

1877
02:36:37,780 --> 02:36:40,780
Guitar Wolf and Guitar Freaks.

1878
02:36:40,780 --> 02:36:42,780
Guitar Wolf is awesome.

1879
02:36:42,780 --> 02:36:45,780
Orange Lounge to do the soundtrack to the next John Waters movie.

1880
02:36:45,780 --> 02:36:58,780
I think I killed the station.

1881
02:36:58,780 --> 02:36:59,780
Well, let's see here.

1882
02:36:59,780 --> 02:37:10,980
We could have the next American Pie movie with Mr. Brian in the final band.

1883
02:37:10,980 --> 02:37:12,500
There is an American Pie movie coming out.

1884
02:37:12,500 --> 02:37:13,500
American Wedding, I know.

1885
02:37:13,500 --> 02:37:14,500
I know.

1886
02:37:14,500 --> 02:37:15,500
The last one.

1887
02:37:15,500 --> 02:37:16,500
Yeah.

1888
02:37:16,500 --> 02:37:17,500
Yeah.

1889
02:37:17,500 --> 02:37:28,260
I have a movie called 42K that you need to watch, it's hilarious, in parts.

1890
02:37:28,260 --> 02:37:30,500
It's got punk music in it.

1891
02:37:30,500 --> 02:37:39,180
Mr. No, it's funny, it has to do with these zombies attacking.

1892
02:37:39,180 --> 02:37:43,060
They're like these zombies attacking this house and then they get these like Renta Ninjas

1893
02:37:43,060 --> 02:37:44,740
they come over and then

1894
02:37:44,740 --> 02:37:47,700
and there's like no there's these eight for alien chicks are

1895
02:37:47,700 --> 02:37:48,660
it's wick

1896
02:37:48,660 --> 02:37:51,660
let me find a tape is hilarious

1897
02:37:51,660 --> 02:37:54,100
now robert you know when you tell me about

1898
02:37:54,100 --> 02:37:58,620
they're actually doing a true sequel to write your picture show

1899
02:37:58,620 --> 02:38:01,060
robin it's a rumor that comes up

1900
02:38:01,060 --> 02:38:04,500
it's a rumor that comes up every now and then they did that one have the music by

1901
02:38:04,500 --> 02:38:05,700
orange lounge

1902
02:38:05,700 --> 02:38:06,820
that would be cool

1903
02:38:06,820 --> 02:38:09,820
except you know the problem with that ritual brian has to do it yesterday he

1904
02:38:09,820 --> 02:38:11,640
should so that he should bike

1905
02:38:11,640 --> 02:38:12,960
contract orange lounge

1906
02:38:12,960 --> 02:38:16,200
okay orange lounge can make a contribution

1907
02:38:16,200 --> 02:38:19,720
but they're not all in french

1908
02:38:19,720 --> 02:38:23,160
i think he gets uh... some help from rena gumo to do something like secret

1909
02:38:23,160 --> 02:38:24,800
tale

1910
02:38:24,800 --> 02:38:26,760
that's really bad i'm sorry

1911
02:38:26,760 --> 02:38:30,960
but in all honesty i think led should do something in a music industry yes like uh...

1912
02:38:30,960 --> 02:38:34,480
like a matrix type movie you know action because some of his really uh... you

1913
02:38:34,480 --> 02:38:35,080
know

1914
02:38:35,080 --> 02:38:36,840
like like uh...

1915
02:38:36,840 --> 02:38:40,700
the outer limit outer limits that song something like that break beats

1916
02:38:40,700 --> 02:38:45,700
Here's a question for you guys. Maybe this has been brought up on the show before, but I actually don't think it ever has, which is surprising.

1917
02:38:45,700 --> 02:38:54,700
If a Bamani artist, any Bamani artist, were to release a CD here in the U.S., which one should do it, and why? Who would have the best chances of success?

1918
02:38:54,700 --> 02:38:58,700
Well, Jamie says Tak, and she releases that.

1919
02:38:58,700 --> 02:39:03,700
I mean, I only said that because she just said that. And, go ahead, Matt, Lucky.

1920
02:39:03,700 --> 02:39:09,700
Well, obviously, it's got to be, I believe, isn't Last Message the good, cool featuring Meg?

1921
02:39:09,700 --> 02:39:11,700
Well, then it'd have to be Meg, because she has a nice rack.

1922
02:39:11,700 --> 02:39:15,700
One thing, actually, Fantastic Plastic Machine does have a CD in the US.

1923
02:39:15,700 --> 02:39:16,700
I have it.

1924
02:39:16,700 --> 02:39:23,700
Outside of ones that already do have one, and maybe like the one to, like outside of Dance Mania artists, let's say,

1925
02:39:23,700 --> 02:39:27,700
because Dance Mania artists already have CDs, most of them, let's say, like, actual Baloney.

1926
02:39:27,700 --> 02:39:29,700
Actual Baloney, you know, sounds sad.

1927
02:39:29,700 --> 02:39:30,700
Konami, which Konami sounds sad.

1928
02:39:30,700 --> 02:39:31,700
I guess, we could say.

1929
02:39:31,700 --> 02:39:38,700
In all honesty, Jamie and Matt both say Good Cool.

1930
02:39:38,700 --> 02:39:43,700
I agree, I think Good Cool would have the most chance of success.

1931
02:39:43,700 --> 02:39:47,700
Actually though, it's funny you mention, I think one person that would have a really kickass CD, L.E.D.

1932
02:39:47,700 --> 02:39:53,700
And I say that because he has so many different styles, like something like something wonderful,

1933
02:39:53,700 --> 02:39:58,700
like kind of slow, kind of ballady epic type song, to like in your face, Strong Jaeger type music.

1934
02:39:58,700 --> 02:39:59,700
I have something to say.

1935
02:39:59,700 --> 02:40:00,700
Sure.

1936
02:40:00,700 --> 02:40:10,140
The staple artists in the Konami Sound staff who are making music for Pumani games, Taka,

1937
02:40:10,140 --> 02:40:16,980
Tak, L.E.D., Naoki, Good Cool, and I'm probably repeating names because they use the same

1938
02:40:16,980 --> 02:40:17,980
names all the time.

1939
02:40:17,980 --> 02:40:22,740
Anyway, they all have a chance releasing and selling good music because they all have good

1940
02:40:22,740 --> 02:40:27,460
resumes as far as the music they've written, so it's really hard to choose which one.

1941
02:40:27,460 --> 02:40:29,060
i mean if you're a local

1942
02:40:29,060 --> 02:40:34,340
he's made music in games that are very popular america so

1943
02:40:34,340 --> 02:40:39,340
for the same

1944
02:40:39,340 --> 02:40:40,460
i don't know

1945
02:40:40,460 --> 02:40:41,860
with them

1946
02:40:41,860 --> 02:40:43,940
so that they can't dismiss

1947
02:40:43,940 --> 02:40:46,460
will be okay i don't know if it's on state

1948
02:40:46,460 --> 02:40:49,020
i don't think you'd have to show a little more diversity break say that

1949
02:40:49,020 --> 02:40:51,700
yeah that's why i think

1950
02:40:51,700 --> 02:40:53,860
that stuff would be picked up by these days like

1951
02:40:53,860 --> 02:40:54,620
yet

1952
02:40:54,620 --> 02:40:57,620
Because all trance music is pretty much the same anyways.

1953
02:40:57,620 --> 02:41:00,620
It's just all synth with a backbeat, that's it.

1954
02:41:00,620 --> 02:41:02,620
I'm surprised with the popularity of DDR.

1955
02:41:02,620 --> 02:41:05,620
You're not hearing such cultish songs from DDR

1956
02:41:05,620 --> 02:41:11,620
that are mega-popular, like Look to the Sky on some dance radio station at night.

1957
02:41:11,620 --> 02:41:14,620
It's because we're in Sacramento and we don't have cool stations like that.

1958
02:41:14,620 --> 02:41:16,620
Ours got kicked off the air, remember?

1959
02:41:16,620 --> 02:41:18,620
Well, there's actually one kind of weird thing.

1960
02:41:18,620 --> 02:41:23,620
One night I was actually coming back from CCL, just getting done playing DDR,

1961
02:41:23,620 --> 02:41:29,100
I was listening to quad you know on Saturdays or whatever they play that like all that trancey stuff

1962
02:41:29,100 --> 02:41:32,500
I actually did hear holic and actually did play it

1963
02:41:32,980 --> 02:41:36,460
Yes, it was because we sat there and debated it for like an hour and a half

1964
02:41:36,460 --> 02:41:38,980
And it actually was holic which I don't know how it got played

1965
02:41:42,820 --> 02:41:45,100
Book fields and heard some to my beat playing out the kitchen

1966
02:41:45,100 --> 02:41:50,100
I know, but that was the thing, I thought that was funny.

1967
02:41:50,100 --> 02:41:52,100
I think Scottie D should have some stuff.

1968
02:41:52,100 --> 02:41:54,100
Yeah.

1969
02:41:54,100 --> 02:41:56,100
I forgot what I was going to say.

1970
02:41:56,100 --> 02:41:59,100
But they should contract Avix tracks again.

1971
02:41:59,100 --> 02:42:01,100
Like they did with Para Para.

1972
02:42:01,100 --> 02:42:06,100
Why do you think Konami doesn't release Bimani soundtracks in the US?

1973
02:42:06,100 --> 02:42:11,100
Besides the fact that DDR USA, the arcade versions, wouldn't have had a good soundtrack?

1974
02:42:41,100 --> 02:42:51,100
There's about 25,000 registered users on DDRFreak, and a lot of soundtracks to real movies sell 5,000 at the most.

1975
02:42:51,100 --> 02:42:57,100
I don't know, because usually what happens, they'll print mass amounts of the CDs because, you know, they do...

1976
02:42:57,100 --> 02:43:05,100
I mean, you think actual artists like, you know, Britney Spears, millions of CDs get printed, and millions of them get bought, because that's just pop, you know?

1977
02:43:05,100 --> 02:43:08,520
Because Konami is cheap and they don't want licensed music and licensing music for a game

1978
02:43:08,520 --> 02:43:11,200
is expensive enough, let alone soundtrack rights as well.

1979
02:43:11,200 --> 02:43:12,200
Yeah, you have to go for more red tape.

1980
02:43:12,200 --> 02:43:15,160
And the fact that making the CDs themselves only costs pennies.

1981
02:43:15,160 --> 02:43:20,160
I mean, it's just the whole licensing rights and because over here in America, we're bastards

1982
02:43:20,160 --> 02:43:25,680
and we charge, or actually, the RIAA is bastards and they charge, you know, up the ass for,

1983
02:43:25,680 --> 02:43:31,120
you know, licensing rights and copyright laws are crazy and it's just, it's a bad situation.

1984
02:43:31,120 --> 02:43:32,120
That's why.

1985
02:43:32,120 --> 02:43:38,400
All we're going to hear is more, like, uh, more fucking covers of Welcome to the Jungle

1986
02:43:38,400 --> 02:43:41,280
and shit by crazy people who don't sound anything like Axl Rose.

1987
02:43:41,280 --> 02:43:46,380
I'm not talking about trying to make, like, DDR music, like, mainstream, like, oh, next

1988
02:43:46,380 --> 02:43:49,120
on MTV on Total Request Live number 10, drop the bomb, yeah!

1989
02:43:49,120 --> 02:43:52,760
I'm not talking about that kind of thing, but just, like, trying to just at least put

1990
02:43:52,760 --> 02:43:53,760
the music out there.

1991
02:43:53,760 --> 02:43:55,800
If the music isn't out there, if you want the music, you have to go underground.

1992
02:43:55,800 --> 02:44:11,800
Yeah, here's what I think. What I can debate why they don't do is maybe they're doing these releases on these home systems, you know, maybe for once release a small sound CD with the game if you pre-order or something, you know?

1993
02:44:11,800 --> 02:44:20,800
Well, they did that with Max. Yeah, Toys R Us. Jamie's got one. Toys R Us did that. They had like a... What was the requirements, Jamie? Remember what you had to do to get that CD?

1994
02:44:20,800 --> 02:44:23,400
No, I got mine from, uh, from...

1995
02:44:23,400 --> 02:44:26,280
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you got yours donated.

1996
02:44:26,280 --> 02:44:28,720
Quote, unquote. No, no, mine was, mine's real.

1997
02:44:28,720 --> 02:44:31,000
It was given to me, uh... Quite, I know, but it was...

1998
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:31,680
For attorney.

1999
02:44:31,680 --> 02:44:35,680
It was a, yeah. I got a few of them that we gave out as prizes for attorney. Right.

2000
02:44:35,680 --> 02:44:39,280
But, um, they do, right, I remember Toys R Us was doing something with those. I think if you

2001
02:44:39,280 --> 02:44:42,880
pre-ordered at Toys R Us, you got that. I think that's how it worked.

2002
02:44:42,880 --> 02:44:47,000
But still, I mean, that's not, that's not like, I can walk into Dimple and see it

2003
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:50,560
in the soundtrack section, or, Dimple is, I'm sorry, because that's only in Sacramento,

2004
02:44:50,560 --> 02:44:59,560
It's a record store, so let's say I can't walk into Virgin Megastore, and Virgin Megastore imports a lot of stuff. They don't import anything Japanese, which baffles me.

2005
02:44:59,560 --> 02:45:02,560
Very limited, though. Very, very limited.

2006
02:45:02,560 --> 02:45:04,560
I will grip a Dragon Ball DC.

2007
02:45:04,560 --> 02:45:09,560
Okay, well, I'm talking like, I don't think you can find a Yumi Hamasaki even, right? You can even...

2008
02:45:09,560 --> 02:45:10,560
You can order it from Dance Media.

2009
02:45:10,560 --> 02:45:13,560
Really? Could you order Dance Media albums through Virgin? Hmm.

2010
02:45:13,560 --> 02:45:15,560
You can totally order anything from Virgin.

2011
02:45:15,560 --> 02:45:19,560
I went to the Virgin Megastore in San Francisco and I never see anything interesting Japanese-wise.

2012
02:45:45,560 --> 02:45:57,560
And it's kind of the thing with America in general and the history of music, it's like pop has always been popular and it's always been the main thing, you know, and we, yeah, we all hate pop, but America goes through its phases.

2013
02:45:57,560 --> 02:46:06,560
It's like, okay, first there's rap, like original rap, like 80s, late 70s rap, Sugarhill Gang rap, and then we go back to pop, you know, Billy Joel.

2014
02:46:06,560 --> 02:46:13,560
Then we go to whatever the next thing is, you know, grunge or whatever, you know, and then we go back to pop.

2015
02:46:13,560 --> 02:46:35,560
We go through these phases, and we already went through our techno trance rave music phase in the mid 90s, and it's gone now. It's not popular. There's a lot of people doing these things, but there's a lot of freaking people in America. A lot more people are listening to Britney Spears. I'm sorry. It's always going to be that way. It's always going to be pop.

2016
02:46:35,560 --> 02:46:39,560
Not always, because music rotates itself every...

2017
02:46:39,560 --> 02:46:42,560
Not that, I wouldn't say that long, probably about more like every four years.

2018
02:46:42,560 --> 02:46:43,560
Okay, then watch.

2019
02:46:43,560 --> 02:46:47,560
Four to ten years from now, we're going to see some Beaumont ECDs printed, finally.

2020
02:46:47,560 --> 02:46:52,560
I'm going to tell you, now this is going to be a really strange sounding theory, and I know I'm going to get booze for this,

2021
02:46:52,560 --> 02:46:55,560
but I'll tell you why Britney Spears and all that's on their way out the door.

2022
02:46:55,560 --> 02:46:56,560
And this is going to sound funny.

2023
02:46:56,560 --> 02:46:57,560
Because they suck.

2024
02:46:57,560 --> 02:47:01,560
American Idol is the reason why Britney Spears is going to be on its way out the door.

2025
02:47:01,560 --> 02:47:04,560
Because it's just, it's saturating, we're seeing too much of it.

2026
02:47:04,560 --> 02:47:05,560
No.

2027
02:47:05,560 --> 02:47:06,560
No.

2028
02:47:06,560 --> 02:47:07,560
No.

2029
02:47:07,560 --> 02:47:10,560
Look at the three people who are in the finals in American Idol right now.

2030
02:47:10,560 --> 02:47:13,560
You have two overweight people and a dork.

2031
02:47:13,560 --> 02:47:14,560
Exactly.

2032
02:47:14,560 --> 02:47:16,440
What does that show America wants right now?

2033
02:47:16,440 --> 02:47:20,680
They are sick and tired of seeing the same cookie cutter image.

2034
02:47:20,680 --> 02:47:21,680
Yeah.

2035
02:47:21,680 --> 02:47:23,880
And... exactly.

2036
02:47:23,880 --> 02:47:24,880
So I'd say that's...

2037
02:47:24,880 --> 02:47:28,640
That's why I'm saying they actually want to hear the music for once and not just the image.

2038
02:47:28,640 --> 02:47:31,740
Far-fetched as it sounds, I think that might be starting to send a message to record companies

2039
02:47:31,740 --> 02:47:42,740
I bet you, even sales of Christina's latest album wasn't as good as her first one, and Britney's putting a new one out in October, and it's probably not going to do as well. I think it's October, but it probably won't do as well.

2040
02:47:42,740 --> 02:47:46,740
Well, wouldn't it be funny if Britney Spears pulled an Alanis?

2041
02:47:46,740 --> 02:47:48,740
What do you mean? Disappeared and came back?

2042
02:47:48,740 --> 02:47:50,740
Stop doing Happy Happy Poppy?

2043
02:47:50,740 --> 02:47:53,740
Alanis used to be a very Happy Poppy person.

2044
02:47:53,740 --> 02:48:00,740
I actually have a video, Alanis Morissette was considered the Tiffany of Canada, and she had the big poofy hair,

2045
02:48:00,740 --> 02:48:04,940
Matt LeBlanc was in one of her videos, she was on the Canadian television, but she used to have, like, these songs.

2046
02:48:04,940 --> 02:48:08,300
I could probably dig up the MP3s on my computer, but I'm too lazy.

2047
02:48:08,300 --> 02:48:10,980
Um, but she used to have, like, really dancy songs.

2048
02:48:10,980 --> 02:48:17,500
She disappeared completely for about four years, and then came back, and she'd, like, grown up, and that's when she did Jagged Little Pill,

2049
02:48:17,500 --> 02:48:23,620
and it was such a, such a controversy, you know, like, oh, now this teen princess talking about blowjobs in a theater type thing.

2050
02:48:23,620 --> 02:48:27,900
But I mean if you think about it the real Tiffany did the same thing didn't she come back and pose for Playboy?

2051
02:48:31,340 --> 02:48:38,900
Well like I mean one thing that I've noticed too is all these people have hella videos and have all these concerts and all these

2052
02:48:38,900 --> 02:48:40,180
fucking appearances

2053
02:48:40,180 --> 02:48:44,620
They you know everybody hears that music so much that people just grow to get tired of it

2054
02:48:44,620 --> 02:48:46,240
Then you got the underground people who?

2055
02:48:46,240 --> 02:48:52,340
Will send their demo to a radio station or something get it played more people want to see more people want to hear

2056
02:48:52,340 --> 02:48:57,020
the people who you don't see every day as opposed to who you do see every day I

2057
02:48:57,020 --> 02:49:01,580
mean that's why I think like if we did have a lot of Bimani's music Bimani

2058
02:49:01,580 --> 02:49:06,080
CDs coming over and or anybody even a lot of the underground you know rappers

2059
02:49:06,080 --> 02:49:10,780
and DJs and stuff like that most people sit there and they don't really want to

2060
02:49:10,780 --> 02:49:14,180
go to really see them they like to know who they are but they like the music so

2061
02:49:14,180 --> 02:49:17,180
much and the music is what keeps the mystery and what keeps them want to be

2062
02:49:17,180 --> 02:49:19,420
there if you don't do a lot of appearances people gonna want to know

2063
02:49:19,420 --> 02:49:25,420
They're going to want to hear your stuff more than, like, oh, look, there's that hoe on TV. You know, it's that whole thing.

2064
02:49:25,420 --> 02:49:31,420
Well, the DJs, they're just a name. They're just a name, so you know which CD to find. That's it.

2065
02:49:31,420 --> 02:49:39,420
I mean, if you met them in real life, you're like, oh, they're really cool. You wouldn't be like, oh, I got a, oh, my God, you know, they're so cool.

2066
02:49:39,420 --> 02:49:40,420
No, it's just, they're just...

2067
02:49:40,420 --> 02:49:43,420
Wait, if I saw Paul Walkenfold, I'd probably give him a hug.

2068
02:49:43,420 --> 02:49:44,420
Yeah, yeah.

2069
02:49:44,420 --> 02:49:51,020
But like, for instance, um, DJ David X, I mean, he's kind of popular over here, I mean,

2070
02:49:51,020 --> 02:49:54,420
you see him personally, like, damn, I don't, he's old.

2071
02:49:54,420 --> 02:49:55,420
Yeah, he's just some...

2072
02:49:55,420 --> 02:50:01,100
He's an actual friend of one of Dan's friends, he's a DJ in Santa Cruz.

2073
02:50:01,100 --> 02:50:04,720
He's cool, but, and the music he plays is really cool, that's the whole point, though.

2074
02:50:04,720 --> 02:50:09,100
It's not like, you know, Britney Spears, you hear more controversy and shit about them.

2075
02:50:09,100 --> 02:50:13,980
When's the last time you've heard, like, a DJ and something weird happening with them?

2076
02:50:13,980 --> 02:50:17,460
like oakenfold you never hear anything on the news like some controversy is it

2077
02:50:17,460 --> 02:50:21,220
because he's just too busy making music and you know doing actual stuff like

2078
02:50:21,220 --> 02:50:25,660
that. You know what actually has made me really happy is that one of my favorite

2079
02:50:25,660 --> 02:50:31,820
Japanese DJ's has his CDs now released in the States DJ Crush makes me very

2080
02:50:31,820 --> 02:50:38,260
very happy and from what I understand I mean he'll do music for anyone you know

2081
02:50:38,260 --> 02:50:43,260
mixing for anyone just you know goes to clubs all the time. I wish he'd come actually

2082
02:50:43,260 --> 02:50:45,700
Well, he had performed here because she even went to see him

2083
02:50:46,800 --> 02:50:52,380
In San Francisco, I think but I would you know, I would like for for just more people internationally

2084
02:50:52,920 --> 02:50:54,920
To make their music available

2085
02:50:55,520 --> 02:50:58,860
Like one thing too and not a lot of people are familiar with the music

2086
02:50:58,860 --> 02:51:02,880
But there's like the band called Dream Theater and I don't know how many people know about them

2087
02:51:02,880 --> 02:51:05,000
But they're over in Japan a lot

2088
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,440
I mean, that's their basic residence is in Japan

2089
02:51:07,440 --> 02:51:13,720
Even though they're completely English singing group and their music sells a lot more over here

2090
02:51:14,080 --> 02:51:16,240
Than they do over than it does in Japan

2091
02:51:16,240 --> 02:51:22,440
I mean and they do they're just random appearances like once every five years you actually get to see them and it's enough to make

2092
02:51:22,440 --> 02:51:27,360
A person want to drop everything and go see image because they don't have huge videos over here people like their music

2093
02:51:27,360 --> 02:51:31,680
I mean, I honestly was about to cut my Santa Cruz trip because they're gonna be in Sacramento on Sunday

2094
02:51:31,680 --> 02:51:34,160
And I was about to cut it, but I like nah, that's okay

2095
02:51:34,160 --> 02:51:39,840
But it's still it's like the point is people will drop with what you're doing if they don't see you getting in trouble

2096
02:51:39,840 --> 02:51:45,040
And they don't see you dressing like an absolute moron and all that kind of stuff, and there's still a hair band

2097
02:51:45,400 --> 02:51:48,520
They are still a hair that is the hair band

2098
02:51:49,560 --> 02:51:51,240
Interesting point I'm reading in the chat room

2099
02:51:51,240 --> 02:51:55,960
I'm just trying to read what folks are saying in the chat room jabberwocky makes an interesting point hi by the way

2100
02:51:57,320 --> 02:52:00,440
He was responding to a comment made on me by Justin

2101
02:52:00,440 --> 02:52:04,780
The record companies put out hundreds of albums each month.

2102
02:52:04,780 --> 02:52:08,000
The terrible music is what people are buying.

2103
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,440
Why is that?

2104
02:52:10,440 --> 02:52:14,840
I was about to say something about the record companies because they basically, I think,

2105
02:52:14,840 --> 02:52:17,520
tell us what we're going to listen to.

2106
02:52:17,520 --> 02:52:21,320
We all are speaking from what we know in our sphere of influence of how we love the music

2107
02:52:21,320 --> 02:52:26,480
and stuff, but you got to remember the main population is going to follow what the record

2108
02:52:26,480 --> 02:52:27,480
company puts out.

2109
02:52:27,480 --> 02:52:32,460
they're putting out all this crappy music and it's getting sold. Why? Why does the record

2110
02:52:32,460 --> 02:52:35,420
company do anything? Money? I don't know.

2111
02:52:35,420 --> 02:52:40,180
This is my theory, the publicist behind the artist. I think there's a lot of wheeling

2112
02:52:40,180 --> 02:52:45,340
and dealing that goes on, especially with MTV. And MTV is to, you know, if you want

2113
02:52:45,340 --> 02:52:49,780
to use the word blame, credit, whatever you want to choose, MTV is really what's shaping

2114
02:52:49,780 --> 02:52:51,740
the music industry right now, like it or not.

2115
02:52:51,740 --> 02:52:52,740
It's all politics.

2116
02:52:52,740 --> 02:52:53,740
Exactly, it's all politics.

2117
02:52:53,740 --> 02:53:00,060
If my politics is the lobbyists pay the politicians, and that's how certain laws get passed. Although

2118
02:53:00,060 --> 02:53:07,780
I kind of buy into the Josie theory. The Josie and the Pussycats. I will elaborate for people

2119
02:53:07,780 --> 02:53:10,740
who haven't seen it.

2120
02:53:10,740 --> 02:53:16,060
One thing too is this is only stuff that I picked up while working at Intercom Radio

2121
02:53:16,060 --> 02:53:22,740
and stuff like that and a lot of it is not so much who is you know who's gonna

2122
02:53:22,740 --> 02:53:27,940
dress I mean who's how old and who looks like what or whatever but part of it is

2123
02:53:27,940 --> 02:53:32,620
the fact that they will go with whoever will dress trashy you know there's

2124
02:53:32,620 --> 02:53:39,420
plenty of girls I out there I have seen shut up don't start no anyways no it's

2125
02:53:39,420 --> 02:53:47,920
It's like, there's, they go to see who will dress like the slut, who will do, I mean there's

2126
02:53:47,920 --> 02:53:51,560
plenty of girls out there who probably look like Britney Spears and who may sound like

2127
02:53:51,560 --> 02:53:58,460
Britney Spears, but they're the ones who won't go as far as the others went.

2128
02:53:58,460 --> 02:54:05,340
And then yeah, it is MTV partially, because they get tons of videos crossing their path

2129
02:54:05,340 --> 02:54:06,340
every day.

2130
02:54:06,340 --> 02:54:08,180
It doesn't mean they're going to play them all, they're going to play with the ones that

2131
02:54:08,180 --> 02:54:12,420
that all the people are fantasizing about and go home and whack it off about or so if

2132
02:54:12,420 --> 02:54:13,420
they do it.

2133
02:54:13,420 --> 02:54:16,580
I mean, that's all it is.

2134
02:54:16,580 --> 02:54:17,580
Nince makes...

2135
02:54:17,580 --> 02:54:20,800
Okay, some interesting points here.

2136
02:54:20,800 --> 02:54:24,860
Nince says in the chat room, people buy the terrible stuff because they don't know about

2137
02:54:24,860 --> 02:54:26,420
the better stuff out there.

2138
02:54:26,420 --> 02:54:27,420
Nince.

2139
02:54:27,420 --> 02:54:28,420
That's actually exactly true.

2140
02:54:28,420 --> 02:54:32,860
Well, and then this is interesting, a response from Jabberwocky, name terrible music, or

2141
02:54:32,860 --> 02:54:35,020
is it just what is popular and what you don't like?

2142
02:54:35,020 --> 02:54:37,540
Well, yeah, I guess terrible music is a...

2143
02:54:37,540 --> 02:54:42,280
I mean, first of all, nobody in this room will pretty much admit to being a fan of Britney

2144
02:54:42,280 --> 02:54:43,400
Spears or any of that stuff.

2145
02:54:43,400 --> 02:54:50,040
I will admit that I like her stuff, I like some of her stuff, but it's getting old.

2146
02:54:50,040 --> 02:54:52,760
I feel like, okay, the pop thing is getting old for me.

2147
02:54:52,760 --> 02:54:56,440
I'm cycling on a four-year thing, you know, I don't really care about her new album anymore.

2148
02:54:56,440 --> 02:54:57,440
She was cute back in the day.

2149
02:54:57,440 --> 02:54:59,600
Oh, look, what a little slut dancing on the screen.

2150
02:54:59,600 --> 02:55:00,600
But I don't care anymore.

2151
02:55:00,600 --> 02:55:06,080
I'm a fan of her future porno with her and Christina Aguilera, hot lesbian action.

2152
02:55:06,080 --> 02:55:14,180
Back to the point here, there's no real way to force people to expose themselves to new

2153
02:55:14,180 --> 02:55:15,180
music.

2154
02:55:15,180 --> 02:55:21,140
Yeah, I guess people will like what they want to like, but I feel like sometimes it's ignorance.

2155
02:55:21,140 --> 02:55:24,260
We only hear what we can hear on the radio, most people.

2156
02:55:24,260 --> 02:55:29,780
Your average music listener isn't a music lover, as in it's their life, they love it

2157
02:55:29,780 --> 02:55:30,780
like I do.

2158
02:55:30,780 --> 02:55:34,880
It's like I have to listen to music all the time, I go watch live music and stuff.

2159
02:55:34,880 --> 02:55:38,580
All they can hear is the radio, so they're being told what to listen to, so that's one

2160
02:55:38,580 --> 02:55:39,580
thing.

2161
02:55:39,580 --> 02:55:42,720
Another thing, yeah, you can't tell them what to listen to, what's terrible music, one person

2162
02:55:42,720 --> 02:55:43,920
likes something else.

2163
02:55:43,920 --> 02:55:45,860
There is actually terrible music.

2164
02:55:45,860 --> 02:55:48,880
I think Britney Spears and stuff is terrible music.

2165
02:55:48,880 --> 02:55:54,320
There's no talent behind it except for she has boobs, she has an ass, she can't sing

2166
02:55:54,320 --> 02:55:55,320
worth shit.

2167
02:55:55,320 --> 02:55:56,880
I've heard so many people who can sing better.

2168
02:55:56,880 --> 02:56:01,160
What do you, okay, what do you think, hold on, hold on, hold on, question, question.

2169
02:56:01,160 --> 02:56:08,160
What do you think about those people on like the fan shows that talk about Britney Spears

2170
02:56:10,280 --> 02:56:12,560
and say, Britney Spears changed my life?

2171
02:56:12,560 --> 02:56:16,320
I think it's sad.

2172
02:56:16,320 --> 02:56:20,720
There's fans of everyone, okay? I'm sure Bob Saget has a huge following. I'm sure Carrot

2173
02:56:20,720 --> 02:56:21,440
Top has a huge following.

2174
02:56:21,440 --> 02:56:26,040
I love Bob Saget, man. I just saw Dick for Coker. What was it?

2175
02:56:26,040 --> 02:56:31,520
There's fans for everybody. There is, there's fans for anybody that appears on TV for like

2176
02:56:31,520 --> 02:56:37,900
just a second. Perfect example, G-Force Portal, that stupid guy that had, he has fans, okay?

2177
02:56:37,900 --> 02:56:41,800
That proves right there that anybody can have fans. We have fans, okay? I mean, it's a-

2178
02:56:41,800 --> 02:56:44,440
Oh, there you go. There's proof right there. We have fans.

2179
02:56:44,440 --> 02:56:45,440
So, no-

2180
02:56:45,440 --> 02:56:46,440
Maybe not me.

2181
02:56:46,440 --> 02:56:49,480
Here's my point. The point is that they'll have fans. They'll have, you know, a certain

2182
02:56:49,480 --> 02:56:53,160
group of people are talking good about them and everything. That's gonna be a given. The

2183
02:56:53,160 --> 02:56:58,120
The fact is that they just, you know, it's just mainstream stuff right now. Like, for

2184
02:56:58,120 --> 02:57:02,180
instance, I don't know really why people buy their CDs and stuff since it's played on the

2185
02:57:02,180 --> 02:57:07,880
record all or on the radio all the time. Like, for instance, 98 Rock in our Sacramento area

2186
02:57:07,880 --> 02:57:12,120
here plays the same shit every day. I can guarantee that I'll hear like a few songs,

2187
02:57:12,120 --> 02:57:17,320
you know, certain songs every day. It's just like a same playlist that's randomized.

2188
02:57:17,320 --> 02:57:22,600
When I worked at 98 Rock, we, my eight-hour shift, you would hear a song 12 times and

2189
02:57:22,600 --> 02:57:26,600
I know it would be the exact same, say, maybe 13, 14 songs.

2190
02:57:26,600 --> 02:57:30,600
It would hear the same song 12 times a day, at least in one eight-hour shift.

2191
02:57:30,600 --> 02:57:32,600
You know what, though? I'll say this, though.

2192
02:57:32,600 --> 02:57:35,600
I got called from 98 Rock a couple times over at the radio station.

2193
02:57:35,600 --> 02:57:37,600
I don't know how I ended up on their list or whatever,

2194
02:57:37,600 --> 02:57:41,600
but they called and would ask me to listen to little seconds of songs.

2195
02:57:41,600 --> 02:57:44,600
And the only reason I did it, I usually don't participate in those phone survey things,

2196
02:57:44,600 --> 02:57:47,600
but I actually knew I'm like, okay, what I'm saying might actually really have an effect

2197
02:57:47,600 --> 02:57:50,600
on what they're going to play on the station, so I should participate.

2198
02:57:50,600 --> 02:57:54,820
funny because a lot of the songs I'd never heard of before. It was actually interesting.

2199
02:57:54,820 --> 02:57:59,640
So they were trying to test stuff I'd never heard before, but the majority of it that

2200
02:57:59,640 --> 02:58:03,200
I found in myself liking was kind of a lot of the mainstream stuff, I'd say, just because

2201
02:58:03,200 --> 02:58:06,780
I was familiar with it. But at the same time, there was a lot of that stuff I did recognize

2202
02:58:06,780 --> 02:58:08,000
as me not liking.

2203
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:12,980
I took one of those where they'd have me compare to, and my response to actually a lot of what

2204
02:58:12,980 --> 02:58:15,980
they'd play, I would be like, I don't like either, I don't like either, I don't like

2205
02:58:15,980 --> 02:58:20,980
either until they'd play like music that sounded like it wasn't cookie-cut

2206
02:58:20,980 --> 02:58:23,700
because for me and you know what I listen to I've listened to some really

2207
02:58:23,700 --> 02:58:27,260
interesting stuff while you've been in it what's in my car right now

2208
02:58:27,260 --> 02:58:32,500
kana and yeah I'm a Japanese music okay I forgot to tell you there's totally a

2209
02:58:32,500 --> 02:58:37,140
different subject Garrett ordered a video of kana videos and so he's gonna

2210
02:58:37,140 --> 02:58:40,060
get it soon and you're gonna have to come over and watch them because I

2211
02:58:40,060 --> 02:58:45,140
showed him the I it's not a DVD it's a tape but I showed him the one and like

2212
02:58:45,140 --> 02:58:48,880
He's just like I have to see the other so I just sorry I forgot to tell you earlier

2213
02:58:50,360 --> 02:58:52,360
CD Japan

2214
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:58,860
It's like basically I mean if you want to find like you like good music

2215
02:58:58,920 --> 02:59:04,800
Why don't you just do it a lot of people do because every different type of music has this why don't you go out and buy?

2216
02:59:04,800 --> 02:59:10,420
Like samplers because samplers a lot of the times not all the time it depends on which label you go through

2217
02:59:10,420 --> 02:59:17,440
They will play new bands that not a lot of people have heard of and that yeah compilations and stuff like that go find those

2218
02:59:17,800 --> 02:59:19,800
Play it listen to them honestly

2219
02:59:20,260 --> 02:59:24,120
Yeah, movie soundtracks also because honestly you're gonna find most music

2220
02:59:24,120 --> 02:59:30,020
You're gonna have you're gonna have in your music collections if you start buying compilation samplers are gonna be all the ones you got off

2221
02:59:30,020 --> 02:59:32,020
Of those it's I mean, it's so basically

2222
02:59:32,500 --> 02:59:33,720
You know it really sucks

2223
02:59:33,720 --> 02:59:38,280
But stop listening to the fucking radio for five minutes and go out and spend five bucks and buy a damn sampler

2224
02:59:40,640 --> 02:59:45,980
Irene oh, yeah, I just have a really simple basic theory, okay

2225
02:59:46,600 --> 02:59:51,800
It's just that people are going for what's familiar and what's

2226
02:59:52,940 --> 02:59:55,280
Simple something that's not too complex

2227
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:58,620
Yeah, exactly. You know they they you know

2228
02:59:58,620 --> 03:00:04,480
Oh, yeah, so they go for Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera because it's simple

2229
03:00:04,480 --> 03:00:09,240
It's not too hard, but then everyone goes through you know their cycles of music. They change

2230
03:00:09,240 --> 03:00:14,460
I mean, I'm not listening to same stuff. I listen to ten years ago five years ago, whatever so I mean it always evolved

2231
03:00:14,460 --> 03:00:19,400
So yeah, I'm gonna pass let's try and wrap this up. I just wanted to say I just want to say really quick

2232
03:00:19,400 --> 03:00:23,360
Okay, go for Jimmy. Well, if you look at it like what do we have today the Backstreet Boys?

2233
03:00:23,680 --> 03:00:26,680
You know when I was in middle school, we had new kids on the block

2234
03:00:26,680 --> 03:00:42,680
In the 70's there was the Partridge Family, but there was David Cassidy. He had fangirls when he died. We have the same thing happen today over these poppy people. It's because they have an image that can be sold.

2235
03:00:42,680 --> 03:01:00,680
Here's the thing. Michael Jackson, he is a pop artist, but he is talented, and that's why he deserves fans, because he writes good music, and he helps produce good music. Maybe not recently, but he certainly knows how to make headlines.

2236
03:01:00,680 --> 03:01:07,680
You can still be a nutjob and do good music, so to say.

2237
03:01:30,680 --> 03:01:35,400
himself cholera-infected water so that he would die because

2238
03:01:35,400 --> 03:01:37,560
i was going to say that passed about five minutes ago

2239
03:01:37,560 --> 03:01:38,640
as i say i am

2240
03:01:38,640 --> 03:01:43,560
uh... as you're saying about their radio and you know stop was really or whatever

2241
03:01:43,560 --> 03:01:46,560
trying and this is going to be really cheap blood but i'm serious here

2242
03:01:46,560 --> 03:01:47,680
good internet radio

2243
03:01:47,680 --> 03:01:49,680
look around the light three six five a m

2244
03:01:49,680 --> 03:01:52,000
uh... thousands of stations

2245
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:54,920
that uh... with your time to listen to if you want to sample new music

2246
03:01:54,920 --> 03:01:57,480
internet radio is a great way to do it because you have

2247
03:01:57,480 --> 03:02:01,140
you have weirdos like us sitting here to put together their own stations of

2248
03:02:01,140 --> 03:02:04,500
stuff they like and how do you find out about a lot of music through your

2249
03:02:04,500 --> 03:02:08,380
friends and what they like so go go look at some uh... other stations of our life

2250
03:02:08,380 --> 03:02:10,660
is exact we give you permission

2251
03:02:10,660 --> 03:02:14,260
we give you permission to go away from one hundred for a little while to go out

2252
03:02:14,260 --> 03:02:16,900
check out some other stations but not very long you got back

2253
03:02:16,900 --> 03:02:17,960
uh...

2254
03:02:17,960 --> 03:02:19,800
uh... thirty minutes ago

2255
03:02:19,800 --> 03:02:22,400
but what i was going to say

2256
03:02:22,400 --> 03:02:24,080
you're talking about uh...

2257
03:02:24,080 --> 03:02:27,240
uh... van gogh or that i had to do is a very good

2258
03:02:27,240 --> 03:02:28,480
instead of talker

2259
03:02:28,480 --> 03:02:31,400
artist he's high on absent and cut off your way do

2260
03:02:31,400 --> 03:02:34,960
he said it was girlfriend he said his girlfriend as like a mall

2261
03:02:34,960 --> 03:02:39,560
well i wonder at the letter said can you hear me now

2262
03:02:39,560 --> 03:02:41,800
and that doesn't make sense but it was funny

2263
03:02:41,800 --> 03:02:43,360
uh... looking together

2264
03:02:43,360 --> 03:02:45,800
you have a final thought i did have a thought on the

2265
03:02:45,800 --> 03:02:47,360
stuff but i think we

2266
03:02:47,360 --> 03:02:49,500
here's the thought that i have

2267
03:02:49,500 --> 03:02:55,420
Go online, get your nice file-sharing service, and download massive amounts of MP3s from

2268
03:02:55,420 --> 03:02:59,700
artists you don't recognize. Don't buy the CDs, because, you know, stupid artists, you

2269
03:02:59,700 --> 03:03:03,300
know, they don't deserve money, because if their music sucks, then, you know, they should

2270
03:03:03,300 --> 03:03:07,060
learn, okay, no one's buying my CD, maybe I should think of a new career, you know?

2271
03:03:07,060 --> 03:03:13,080
Did you put the disclaimer at the beginning that some of these people, their views and

2272
03:03:13,080 --> 03:03:17,380
opinions do not, you know, reflect the opinions of Orange Lounge Radio?

2273
03:03:17,380 --> 03:03:19,380
They don't know that by now they're retarded

2274
03:03:20,380 --> 03:03:22,540
You know what? He's absolutely right though

2275
03:03:22,540 --> 03:03:27,540
If you can't make music stop making crappy music if you have enough people telling you hey, buddy

2276
03:03:27,540 --> 03:03:30,820
You're shitty did stop making music sometimes that doesn't work

2277
03:03:30,820 --> 03:03:36,900
But what okay back to the Britney Spears not only what about the one that says you changed my life through your music

2278
03:03:36,900 --> 03:03:40,900
There's always going to be somebody who says that.

2279
03:03:40,900 --> 03:03:43,900
Guess what, um, Ghost in the Shell changed my life.

2280
03:03:43,900 --> 03:03:46,900
Because it made me want to be a ghost in the shell.

2281
03:03:46,900 --> 03:03:49,900
You know, it's stupid.

2282
03:03:49,900 --> 03:03:51,900
Yes, now I know how to make Lego sex.

2283
03:03:51,900 --> 03:03:53,900
First off, all those people who are saying, oh this changed my life.

2284
03:03:53,900 --> 03:03:57,900
First and foremost, the only one you should change your life for is yourself.

2285
03:03:57,900 --> 03:03:58,900
You're shallow.

2286
03:03:58,900 --> 03:04:00,900
You need to take responsibility for yourself.

2287
03:04:00,900 --> 03:04:02,900
That's sad that one song changes your life.

2288
03:04:02,900 --> 03:04:06,900
That is the biggest problem with people today is they don't take responsibility for themselves.

2289
03:04:06,900 --> 03:04:09,900
Yeah, that scares me that Britney Spears is changing all these youngins' life.

2290
03:04:09,900 --> 03:04:11,900
It just scares me for my future.

2291
03:04:11,900 --> 03:04:15,900
They're hitting the responsibility for their changes on other people.

2292
03:04:15,900 --> 03:04:17,900
They're blaming other people for what's going on in their lives.

2293
03:04:17,900 --> 03:04:20,900
They need to start taking responsibility and be their own person.

2294
03:04:20,900 --> 03:04:22,900
So you're changing your life?

2295
03:04:22,900 --> 03:04:22,900
Yeah.

2296
03:04:22,900 --> 03:04:23,900
Yeah, changing my life.

2297
03:04:23,900 --> 03:04:27,900
Now I wear short skirts and I have sex with everybody.

2298
03:04:27,900 --> 03:04:28,900
We need more of those people.

2299
03:04:28,900 --> 03:04:32,900
Okay, well, what an excellent way to fill a half hour.

2300
03:04:32,900 --> 03:04:36,900
We're kind of past our 9.30 time now, so away from that topic now.

2301
03:04:36,900 --> 03:04:38,900
Thanks you guys, that was really good.

2302
03:04:38,900 --> 03:04:40,900
Wow, this has been a really good show tonight.

2303
03:04:40,900 --> 03:04:42,900
We had a professional discussion.

2304
03:04:42,900 --> 03:04:45,900
We had intelligent conversation and debate.

2305
03:04:45,900 --> 03:04:48,900
I guess that's debatable, and I'm sure our chat room debates that right now.

2306
03:04:48,900 --> 03:04:50,900
We talked about porn, we worked porn in.

2307
03:04:50,900 --> 03:04:54,900
Okay, yeah, we got the blowjob thing in at the beginning.

2308
03:04:54,900 --> 03:05:01,900
Alright, we worked at the truck stop. Okay, so now I'm going to ask everybody, thank you

2309
03:05:01,900 --> 03:05:06,140
everybody, what a good way to end season 2. What a very nice way to end the season 2 finale

2310
03:05:06,140 --> 03:05:12,100
there. Just a reminder everybody, next week, no show, but we got an even better thing planned,

2311
03:05:12,100 --> 03:05:20,860
Saturday live all freaking day from B3, the tournament of the century at Pier 39. We might

2312
03:05:20,860 --> 03:05:27,500
be there Sunday as well. Don't know yet. We'll see. Anyway, let me go around and get some

2313
03:05:27,500 --> 03:05:29,940
final thoughts from everybody. Jamie, you want to start or you want to be last?

2314
03:05:29,940 --> 03:05:36,740
I'll be last. Okay. Brad, final thought. Tough.

2315
03:05:36,740 --> 03:05:44,140
What lesson did we learn today, kids? Music industry is communism. Don't follow him.

2316
03:05:44,140 --> 03:05:48,580
Okay. Irene, final thought? It doesn't have to be about the topic we've been discussing.

2317
03:05:48,580 --> 03:05:50,860
anything you want

2318
03:05:50,860 --> 03:05:55,680

2328
03:06:26,620 --> 03:06:28,620
Basically my final thought is

2329
03:06:28,780 --> 03:06:33,100
Take everything I have we have said about the radio and use it in your daily life

2330
03:06:33,460 --> 03:06:38,060
Don't be conformist and be an individual and don't let don't let people tell you

2331
03:06:38,420 --> 03:06:40,900
What to do and don't let them tell you what to like

2332
03:06:40,900 --> 03:06:47,460
Be yourself, or else we'll just have a bunch of robots running around and it'll just end

2333
03:06:47,460 --> 03:06:49,740
up being the destruction of the human fucking race.

2334
03:06:49,740 --> 03:06:50,740
Goodbye.

2335
03:06:50,740 --> 03:06:52,640
I guess I will go ahead and give my final thought.

2336
03:06:52,640 --> 03:06:56,160
My final thought is thank you everybody for supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

2337
03:06:56,160 --> 03:07:00,700
Thank you everybody who listens to this show every Sunday, our fans.

2338

Thank you everybody who supports Orange Launch Radio

2343
03:07:13,540 --> 03:07:15,540
and listens to our Bahmani Music Amor program.

2344
03:07:15,540 --> 03:07:18,540
It's been almost a year now that we've been doing Orange Launch.

2345
03:07:18,540 --> 03:07:19,540
It's been a blast.

2346
03:07:19,540 --> 03:07:23,540
And in two weeks, we come back to you with Orange Launch Radio Season 3.

2347
03:07:23,540 --> 03:07:25,540
We're going to have a webcam of some sorts to show things

2348
03:07:25,540 --> 03:07:27,540
when we want to show them to you.

2349
03:07:27,540 --> 03:07:29,540
Phones, we're working on it.

2350
03:07:29,540 --> 03:07:30,540
Loki is busy.

2351
03:07:30,540 --> 03:07:32,540
We were hoping that the phones would be the big thing

2352
03:07:32,540 --> 03:07:33,540
we can bring into Season 3.

2353
03:07:33,540 --> 03:07:34,540
We don't know if we can have it the first week,

2354
03:07:34,540 --> 03:07:36,540
but Loki is on it,

2355
03:07:36,540 --> 03:07:38,540
and we all know that that means scary.

2356
03:07:38,540 --> 03:07:41,540
Scary, so thank you everybody for your support. We appreciate it.

2357
03:07:41,540 --> 03:07:43,540
Now 1-900-HOT-THUCK.

2358
03:07:43,540 --> 03:07:44,540
Loki, quick...

2359
03:07:44,540 --> 03:07:47,540
Well, I'm going to let Jamie do her final thought and then we'll end with yours.

2360
03:07:47,540 --> 03:07:49,540
Jamie?

2361
03:07:49,540 --> 03:07:52,540
Mine is give me a dollar.

2362
03:07:52,540 --> 03:07:55,540
Len Loki, dare I ask what's your final thought?

2363
03:07:55,540 --> 03:08:02,540
What I don't understand in this world is how there can be so many hidden camera people with these ugly guys going out,

2364
03:08:02,540 --> 03:08:05,540
finding people in random places and then gaining them to do sexual acts on them.

2365
03:08:05,540 --> 03:08:12,540
So I leave you with yet another streetblowjob.com video.
