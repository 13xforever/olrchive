1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:02,690
[SPEAKER_17]: Message for you, son!

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,410
[SPEAKER_13]: Attention!

3
00:00:05,011 --> 00:00:08,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

4
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:15,554
[SPEAKER_17]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

5
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:22,160
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,680
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,961
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

8
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:32,402
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

9
00:00:33,182 --> 00:00:33,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kidding.

10
00:00:33,782 --> 00:00:35,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

11
00:00:35,582 --> 00:00:38,123
[SPEAKER_05]: In this episode... Hey, are there any balls down there?

12
00:00:38,143 --> 00:00:40,323
That's the biggest fairy you've ever seen, Tinkle Fairy.

13
00:00:40,343 --> 00:00:42,104
[SPEAKER_21]: What's your favorite scary movie?

14
00:00:49,022 --> 00:00:49,602
[SPEAKER_16]: Showgirls.

15
00:00:50,503 --> 00:00:51,724
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely frightful.

16
00:00:51,924 --> 00:00:52,725
[SPEAKER_16]: What's yours?

17
00:00:52,745 --> 00:00:55,206
[SPEAKER_16]: There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

18
00:00:55,266 --> 00:00:57,148
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't torture yourself.

19
00:00:57,168 --> 00:00:58,028
[SPEAKER_19]: That's my job.

20
00:00:58,148 --> 00:00:59,890
[SPEAKER_16]: Now's the time our sprockets made me dogs!

21
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:03,052
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll get you, my pretty!

22
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:04,593
[SPEAKER_19]: And your little dog, too!

23
00:01:04,993 --> 00:01:05,914
[SPEAKER_16]: I know Kung Fu.

24
00:01:06,254 --> 00:01:08,876
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

25
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:10,757
[SPEAKER_16]: Why did they have to take the word gay?

26
00:01:12,378 --> 00:01:15,000
[SPEAKER_19]: No one expects a Spanish exposition!

27
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,141
[SPEAKER_19]: It's Kendo.

28
00:01:16,181 --> 00:01:16,521
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey!

29
00:01:18,971 --> 00:01:20,773
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura Shut up!

30
00:01:20,973 --> 00:01:21,654
[SPEAKER_18]: Where's my gun?

31
00:01:21,774 --> 00:01:23,716
[SPEAKER_18]: This is my boomstick!

32
00:01:24,176 --> 00:01:26,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Sky Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!

33
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:30,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.

34
00:01:30,803 --> 00:01:33,565
[SPEAKER_21]: What kind of warping being would find that funny?

35
00:01:33,846 --> 00:01:35,327
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge Radio

36
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:43,434
[SPEAKER_05]: We are live, and this is episode number 44 for May the 11th of 2003.

37
00:01:43,634 --> 00:01:51,839
[SPEAKER_05]: You're tuned into the Bimani Scene's most sleep-deprived radio station of all things B-Money.

38
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,521
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.

39
00:01:57,182 --> 00:01:59,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.

40
00:01:59,883 --> 00:02:01,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, usually awesome co-hosts.

41
00:02:01,804 --> 00:02:04,546
[SPEAKER_10]: When the show's not going on, they're pretty awesome.

42
00:02:06,522 --> 00:02:09,082
[SPEAKER_05]: In this corner, the happiest buddy on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

43
00:02:09,122 --> 00:02:10,443
[SPEAKER_05]: You know her better as DarkSakura.

44
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:12,863
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, insert witty comment here.

45
00:02:13,523 --> 00:02:15,384
[SPEAKER_05]: In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

46
00:02:15,904 --> 00:02:16,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

47
00:02:16,684 --> 00:02:20,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Who hooked up the microphones in amazing 15 seconds before we started tonight's show.

48
00:02:22,585 --> 00:02:25,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Also with us tonight, say hello to Intern Zero.

49
00:02:25,965 --> 00:02:27,866
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't get this fucking cookie out of the package.

50
00:02:27,886 --> 00:02:29,646
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, like, pissing me off.

51
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:30,726
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds kind of sexual.

52
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:31,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

53
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:34,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn it, I'm not really going to be able to get that one out.

54
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:37,164
[SPEAKER_05]: That was great.

55
00:02:37,364 --> 00:02:39,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie went, and she got the cookie out of the package, and then she ate it.

56
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:43,607
[SPEAKER_05]: That was almost zing-worthy.

57
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:45,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.

58
00:02:45,348 --> 00:02:46,169
[SPEAKER_05]: She got one for me.

59
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:47,369
[SPEAKER_05]: She's redeemed.

60
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:49,210
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just the four of us here tonight.

61
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:51,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting really close, getting to know each other.

62
00:02:52,752 --> 00:02:53,652
[SPEAKER_05]: Loving each other a little more.

63
00:02:56,874 --> 00:02:59,815
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be talking to everyone more a bit later, but first we're going to take a quick break.

64
00:03:02,357 --> 00:03:03,357
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to break stuff.

65
00:03:03,897 --> 00:03:05,158
[SPEAKER_13]: We're taking a hit off the cookie.

66
00:03:05,993 --> 00:03:07,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Describe these cookies you're eating.

67
00:03:07,234 --> 00:03:11,335
[SPEAKER_05]: They're interesting because they come in a plastic wrapped thing.

68
00:03:11,396 --> 00:03:13,677
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like a can of Pringles, but they're cookies.

69
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they're shingles.

70
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:18,339
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they're German cookies.

71
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:25,422
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like dark German chocolate, but it doesn't really taste like dark chocolate, between two thin cookies, and it's really good.

72
00:03:26,342 --> 00:03:28,203
[SPEAKER_06]: And it tastes good, too.

73
00:03:28,443 --> 00:03:29,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Are these people moving?

74
00:03:30,204 --> 00:03:31,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, our neighbors are moving.

75
00:03:32,065 --> 00:03:32,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

76
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:33,746
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't need neighbors.

77
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Rogers isn't around anymore.

78
00:03:36,451 --> 00:03:37,291
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't need neighbors.

79
00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:39,992
[SPEAKER_05]: You're so nice.

80
00:03:40,112 --> 00:03:40,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone's so nice here.

81
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,673
[SPEAKER_13]: I got his and that thingy's.

82
00:03:44,554 --> 00:03:47,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we're going to start this break with an interesting song.

83
00:03:47,315 --> 00:03:48,355
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an interesting song.

84
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,675
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something that was downloaded.

85
00:03:49,695 --> 00:03:51,416
[SPEAKER_05]: It was sent to me from DarkTetsuya in the chatroom.

86
00:03:51,456 --> 00:03:53,437
[SPEAKER_05]: He got it from MGZ.com.

87
00:03:53,777 --> 00:03:57,438
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is supposedly from Night Style, although there's a little bit of skepticism about it.

88
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:00,580
[SPEAKER_05]: It's V remixed by Naoki.

89
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:01,740
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

90
00:04:02,045 --> 00:04:10,550
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's a lot of skepticism going on around this one, and this is the reason why people are skeptical, because it's really good quality, and no good quality MP3s have come out from Nightstyle yet.

91
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,413
[SPEAKER_05]: That, and the fact that this MP3 is two and a half minutes, which, for a 2DX song, that's a long ass time.

92
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:16,674
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure it's really long.

93
00:04:17,114 --> 00:04:17,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, what?

94
00:04:17,695 --> 00:04:18,835
[SPEAKER_13]: Solo's heard me go, bleh.

95
00:04:19,836 --> 00:04:20,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Two and a half minutes?

96
00:04:21,257 --> 00:04:25,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then it's a possibility, but it's kind of, you know, we're not saying it's official.

97
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,801
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not saying it's official, but it might be.

98
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,022
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it is official, then we were the first to play it, right?

99
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:30,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

100
00:04:31,826 --> 00:04:32,328
[SPEAKER_05]: So enjoy this.

101
00:04:32,348 --> 00:04:36,699
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to play this V remix by Naoki, and then we'll play something from Taka and something from Naoki.

102
00:04:37,261 --> 00:04:37,902
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll be back.

103
00:04:38,604 --> 00:04:38,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy!

104
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:11,553
DarkSakura.com

105
00:08:44,084 --> 00:08:44,746
Thanks for watching!

106
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:13,958
Thanks for watching!

107
00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:44,122
Thanks for watching!

108
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:18,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio.

109
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,770
[SPEAKER_05]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

110
00:11:24,912 --> 00:11:27,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

111
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:30,034
[SPEAKER_13]: I can say words in reverse, too.

112
00:11:30,494 --> 00:11:30,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it.

113
00:11:30,974 --> 00:11:31,654
[SPEAKER_13]: Mom.

114
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:33,555
Radar.

115
00:11:33,835 --> 00:11:35,055
[SPEAKER_13]: God and dog.

116
00:11:36,576 --> 00:11:37,096
[SPEAKER_13]: Radar.

117
00:11:37,876 --> 00:11:39,177
[SPEAKER_13]: Or that'd be Radair.

118
00:11:39,517 --> 00:11:40,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Race car, right?

119
00:11:41,057 --> 00:11:41,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Race car.

120
00:11:41,718 --> 00:11:41,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

121
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:42,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, race car.

122
00:11:44,798 --> 00:11:46,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of mom, happy Mother's Day.

123
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,641
[SPEAKER_13]: Happy Mother's Day, and I didn't let my mom listen to the show.

124
00:11:49,741 --> 00:11:52,884
[SPEAKER_05]: To all of our mothers out there listening, which hopefully is none of them.

125
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,625
[SPEAKER_13]: Mom's like, I want to listen to your radio show.

126
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:57,006
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, no you don't.

127
00:11:59,864 --> 00:12:00,444
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

128
00:12:20,093 --> 00:12:22,414
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we don't do the sex quiz on this show, but it's still pretty bad.

129
00:12:22,474 --> 00:12:27,575
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it's too bad though that we do Rocky on Saturday nights because we can't listen to Travis and Jenna.

130
00:12:27,835 --> 00:12:30,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm trying to see if they're ever going to rebroadcast their show.

131
00:12:30,596 --> 00:12:32,917
[SPEAKER_05]: I know they do, they have new shows, they have spin-off shows now.

132
00:12:32,937 --> 00:12:36,398
[SPEAKER_05]: They have like the 80s show and some club, goth club show that Travis does.

133
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:39,799
[SPEAKER_05]: So, oh yeah, so we'll plug Under Station Live, our buddies over there.

134
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:41,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, goth talk.

135
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:52,089
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm Azrael Abyss, Prince of Sorrow It's a piece of shit

136
00:12:57,474 --> 00:13:01,716
[SPEAKER_13]: If that was Naoki, then it means that Naoki sat on V and farted and out that came.

137
00:13:03,597 --> 00:13:04,078
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

138
00:13:05,038 --> 00:13:07,239
[SPEAKER_13]: As much as we bag on Naoki, he's very talented.

139
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,561
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know he could do much better than that.

140
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:10,401
[SPEAKER_13]: That is not Naoki.

141
00:13:10,981 --> 00:13:16,864
[SPEAKER_13]: And anyone who thinks that that's Naoki, who actually believes that that's a Naoki remix, needs to get their head examined.

142
00:13:17,305 --> 00:13:18,805
[SPEAKER_13]: Or either that or get it out of the toilet.

143
00:13:18,825 --> 00:13:20,906
[SPEAKER_05]: So what are you going to do if it comes out that that's real?

144
00:13:23,008 --> 00:13:23,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to have a cry?

145
00:13:25,465 --> 00:13:29,466
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm probably never going to listen to another Naoki mix again because he's lost all of his talent.

146
00:13:31,507 --> 00:13:33,608
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe let Politary remix it and put his name on it.

147
00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:36,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, maybe that's it.

148
00:13:36,408 --> 00:13:38,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe let Politary do all the work this time.

149
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,370
[SPEAKER_13]: I can tell that it's unique.

150
00:13:42,924 --> 00:13:43,524
[SPEAKER_05]: It's special.

151
00:13:43,584 --> 00:13:44,144
[SPEAKER_13]: Eating a cookie.

152
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,926
[SPEAKER_13]: First of all, I was in band and I took music theory and music appreciation and everything.

153
00:13:48,946 --> 00:13:49,987
[SPEAKER_13]: I started off as a music major.

154
00:13:51,407 --> 00:13:53,928
[SPEAKER_13]: I have listened to Winter so many times, it's not even funny.

155
00:13:55,029 --> 00:14:00,531
[SPEAKER_13]: And I could tell that the second half of the song was completely ripped from Winter.

156
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:02,711
[SPEAKER_13]: It was actually, you know, unique parts.

157
00:14:04,152 --> 00:14:06,893
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is the only way I could think that that's a new mix.

158
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:08,654
[SPEAKER_13]: But Nelke could do better.

159
00:14:09,414 --> 00:14:10,174
[SPEAKER_13]: So much better.

160
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:11,995
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't think that's Nelke.

161
00:14:12,694 --> 00:14:19,620
[SPEAKER_05]: As Like La Morete La Bierte, which is the other song we heard in there, the last song we heard in that break, which is a good Naoki song, very good Naoki song.

162
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,761
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the middle there was Tomorrow Perfume.

163
00:14:22,422 --> 00:14:23,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody knows that one, from Taka.

164
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:26,085
[SPEAKER_11]: That song pissed me off.

165
00:14:26,585 --> 00:14:27,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Why does that piss you off?

166
00:14:28,727 --> 00:14:30,628
[SPEAKER_13]: Just because it's difficult, it's a seven.

167
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:35,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you seen the latest custom non-stop that's in our machine at Scandia?

168
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:35,332
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

169
00:14:35,713 --> 00:14:37,794
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sad, I mean it's like really hard.

170
00:14:37,994 --> 00:14:39,255
[SPEAKER_13]: Who decided that one goes in?

171
00:14:39,996 --> 00:14:40,917
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give you two guesses.

172
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,123
[SPEAKER_05]: The first guess starts with an E and ends with Rick.

173
00:14:44,824 --> 00:14:45,565
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll bet you anything.

174
00:14:47,827 --> 00:14:48,808
[SPEAKER_13]: You should let me put one in.

175
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:53,214
[SPEAKER_13]: You should let me put one in and that'd be like seven stars Jamie can pass.

176
00:14:53,874 --> 00:14:55,216
[SPEAKER_13]: Three of them in the last two songs would be blank.

177
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,621
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be like ones you've almost passed.

178
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:01,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Come really close.

179
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:04,763
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, this is the songs that he has in there.

180
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:13,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Summer Vacation, Tomorrow Perfume, Traces, Xenon, and A. And you know what's really fucked about that?

181
00:15:14,126 --> 00:15:19,507
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't change your speeds in the middle of a non-stop course on 8th style or whatever when you're playing 2DX non-stops.

182
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:20,387
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't change your speed.

183
00:15:20,788 --> 00:15:24,709
[SPEAKER_05]: So whatever speed you play Summer Vacation on, like I play High Speed 3, you have to.

184
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:25,829
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to play A on.

185
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:32,843
[SPEAKER_07]: We just take a hit right after, you know, like, right before A. Then everything's like bullet time.

186
00:15:32,903 --> 00:15:36,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like, I see the keys coming down!

187
00:15:37,626 --> 00:15:37,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Ugh!

188
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:39,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

189
00:15:40,628 --> 00:15:41,288
[SPEAKER_05]: You and drugs.

190
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:44,730
[SPEAKER_05]: You should.

191
00:15:46,731 --> 00:15:47,192
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just kidding.

192
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:47,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't do drugs.

193
00:15:47,612 --> 00:15:48,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Drugs are bad, okay?

194
00:15:49,173 --> 00:15:49,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Drugs are bad.

195
00:15:50,974 --> 00:15:51,634
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm very happy.

196
00:15:51,934 --> 00:15:52,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are you happy?

197
00:15:52,495 --> 00:15:54,496
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I just had a cookie.

198
00:15:55,848 --> 00:15:57,589
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what that whole drugs thing reminds me of?

199
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:03,753
[SPEAKER_06]: On Beemani Sims, Omnicrash made a song called Beemani Song.

200
00:16:04,774 --> 00:16:10,577
[SPEAKER_06]: And he like totally... Is that the one that sounds like the sunscreen song?

201
00:16:10,597 --> 00:16:11,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, here we go.

202
00:16:11,838 --> 00:16:14,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, okay, we're gonna hear a clip.

203
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,801
[SPEAKER_06]: This song is so mean.

204
00:16:18,882 --> 00:16:23,984
[SPEAKER_06]: It is short, but you gotta play the best part in the middle, right after the least 100 seconds.

205
00:16:24,764 --> 00:16:25,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sorry.

206
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:27,365
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just me, though.

207
00:16:27,925 --> 00:16:31,247
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, that song is so funny, especially when it talks about jokes.

208
00:16:32,807 --> 00:16:35,308
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll like it, but he can't say DWI.

209
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,869
[SPEAKER_06]: He says DWI.

210
00:16:37,609 --> 00:16:38,609
[SPEAKER_06]: DWI.

211
00:16:38,849 --> 00:16:43,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, what we'll do to make this interesting is we'll let Loki play the whole song, and we'll make live commentary.

212
00:16:47,082 --> 00:16:51,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Loki's going to find that, so we'll broadcast that to you a little bit.

213
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:54,506
[SPEAKER_05]: What else is new?

214
00:16:54,686 --> 00:16:55,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other Mother's Day things?

215
00:16:55,866 --> 00:16:57,227
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you guys do for Mother's Day today?

216
00:16:57,527 --> 00:17:00,628
[SPEAKER_13]: I called my mom on my cell phone driving into his house.

217
00:17:01,609 --> 00:17:02,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Driving into my house?

218
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:08,552
[SPEAKER_13]: I was turning to go down the street to your house and I was on the phone with my mom and I had to hang up with her.

219
00:17:08,712 --> 00:17:13,715
[SPEAKER_13]: I prefer not to be retarded and drive and talk on my cell phone because I would likely...

220
00:17:15,983 --> 00:17:17,864
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you do it and I still think it's retarded.

221
00:17:18,564 --> 00:17:18,924
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay?

222
00:17:20,284 --> 00:17:21,545
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried to call my mom.

223
00:17:21,745 --> 00:17:22,805
[SPEAKER_06]: She didn't answer her phone.

224
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:24,785
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think she wants to hear from me today.

225
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:29,506
[SPEAKER_06]: But we only talk like once a month, so I mean... Are those your neighbors that I hate?

226
00:17:29,526 --> 00:17:30,727
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

227
00:17:30,747 --> 00:17:31,367
[SPEAKER_13]: The ones upstairs?

228
00:17:31,387 --> 00:17:31,427
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

229
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:32,787
The ones downstairs.

230
00:17:33,287 --> 00:17:33,808
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, poo.

231
00:17:33,828 --> 00:17:34,968
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish the ones that I hate would move.

232
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:36,188
[SPEAKER_06]: I can go kick their door.

233
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:36,968
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just kidding.

234
00:17:37,488 --> 00:17:38,289
[SPEAKER_13]: The ones that I hate?

235
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:40,889
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, when we met them, they were nice.

236
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:41,629
[SPEAKER_13]: The people over there?

237
00:17:41,649 --> 00:17:42,330
[SPEAKER_13]: Up here.

238
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:43,750
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, they were...

239
00:17:44,386 --> 00:17:46,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Anime, it's better than sex Anime, it's better than sex

240
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:10,736
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that say?

241
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:11,877
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet.

242
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,158
[SPEAKER_05]: We're lucky.

243
00:18:13,238 --> 00:18:14,980
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Sobey Zen here.

244
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, what's mine say?

245
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:16,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

246
00:18:17,702 --> 00:18:21,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine says... I got Robisobey.

247
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Merchant of the Mekong Delta.

248
00:18:25,248 --> 00:18:26,909
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

249
00:18:29,431 --> 00:18:31,994
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, isn't it nice when you can get a DWI in like five seconds?

250
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:36,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine pisses me off, because it's a fucking political reference.

251
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,118
[SPEAKER_06]: What's it say?

252
00:18:37,318 --> 00:18:39,139
[SPEAKER_06]: George W. Lizardo...

253
00:18:40,555 --> 00:18:41,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Some stupid crap.

254
00:18:42,036 --> 00:18:42,356
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

255
00:18:43,577 --> 00:18:45,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I hate this political crap.

256
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:48,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, time for the best song in the world.

257
00:18:50,482 --> 00:18:51,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, ah, what's this say?

258
00:18:53,203 --> 00:18:55,485
[SPEAKER_05]: George W. Lizardo, it really does say that.

259
00:18:55,525 --> 00:18:56,125
[SPEAKER_05]: That's sad.

260
00:18:56,806 --> 00:18:57,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's hear the song.

261
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:03,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Loading, loading.

262
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you turn it up a little?

263
00:19:06,587 --> 00:19:09,750
[SPEAKER_22]: Bimani Ruler's V is not the greatest DOI ever.

264
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,671
[SPEAKER_22]: Neither is his A. Hold on.

265
00:19:11,711 --> 00:19:13,133
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to do it again.

266
00:19:15,034 --> 00:19:19,278
[SPEAKER_21]: La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

267
00:19:19,698 --> 00:19:20,819
[SPEAKER_13]: Connect the dots.

268
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:21,960
[SPEAKER_13]: La, la.

269
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Now loading.

270
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:24,462
[SPEAKER_13]: Now loading.

271
00:19:25,984 --> 00:19:26,704
[SPEAKER_13]: Now maroding.

272
00:19:27,545 --> 00:19:29,867
[SPEAKER_05]: At least my soapy thing didn't say something about me, Crob.

273
00:19:30,648 --> 00:19:32,209
[SPEAKER_22]: This is the Bimani Sim's song.

274
00:19:33,695 --> 00:19:33,955
[SPEAKER_22]: I agree.

275
00:19:33,975 --> 00:19:34,175
[SPEAKER_22]: I agree.

276
00:19:34,235 --> 00:19:35,396
[SPEAKER_22]: Pretty much, yeah.

277
00:19:35,436 --> 00:19:35,836
[SPEAKER_22]: That's debatable.

278
00:19:35,876 --> 00:19:36,416
[SPEAKER_22]: How would you know?

279
00:19:36,496 --> 00:19:37,756
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't, I don't, I don't.

280
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:03,568
[SPEAKER_22]: That was dumb.

281
00:20:03,588 --> 00:20:04,328
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, yes.

282
00:20:19,022 --> 00:20:24,743
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyone with the name like Dynamite Rave 68246 Ani is not to be trusted.

283
00:20:25,804 --> 00:20:26,604
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, yeah, huh?

284
00:20:26,844 --> 00:20:28,724
[SPEAKER_22]: All the things she said has been done.

285
00:20:29,224 --> 00:20:29,764
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care!

286
00:20:29,784 --> 00:20:30,184
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great song!

287
00:20:30,204 --> 00:20:31,825
[SPEAKER_22]: All the things she didn't say.

288
00:20:32,945 --> 00:20:36,646
[SPEAKER_22]: My next two DIYs involve poltergeists and pants.

289
00:20:37,926 --> 00:20:39,846
[SPEAKER_22]: X-Step is the antichrist.

290
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,027
[SPEAKER_22]: BimaniStyle owns me.

291
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,107
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, it's true.

292
00:20:44,007 --> 00:20:47,348
[SPEAKER_22]: At least 100 seconds is enough time for me to get a sandwich.

293
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:52,712
[SPEAKER_22]: Mooglehunter is on speed on possibly every other drug known to man.

294
00:20:52,892 --> 00:20:56,436
[SPEAKER_22]: The world needs more spontaneous para para dancing.

295
00:20:57,657 --> 00:21:00,239
[SPEAKER_22]: The background to Zenon is really stupid.

296
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,883
[SPEAKER_22]: Not every song needs challenge steps.

297
00:21:04,684 --> 00:21:05,064
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm done.

298
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:10,435
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what's funny?

299
00:21:10,635 --> 00:21:12,356
[SPEAKER_05]: How come we've never had Moogle Hunter on this show?

300
00:21:12,376 --> 00:21:14,417
[SPEAKER_05]: He freaking lives not too far away.

301
00:21:14,437 --> 00:21:17,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because he's too busy doing drugs, apparently.

302
00:21:17,538 --> 00:21:20,920
[SPEAKER_13]: And then to quote Dinosaur, when he dies, we'll smoke his ashes.

303
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:24,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Who did that song?

304
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:25,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Who gets credit for that?

305
00:21:26,642 --> 00:21:27,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Omnicrash.

306
00:21:29,143 --> 00:21:30,243
[SPEAKER_09]: He didn't say Oni right.

307
00:21:30,984 --> 00:21:32,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he mispronounced a bunch of words.

308
00:21:32,764 --> 00:21:33,965
[SPEAKER_05]: He must be Canadian or something.

309
00:21:36,126 --> 00:21:36,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Is he Canadian?

310
00:21:37,226 --> 00:21:38,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Canadians pronounce things funny.

311
00:21:40,663 --> 00:21:43,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he said like Sakura and DUIs.

312
00:21:44,244 --> 00:21:44,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Zenon.

313
00:21:45,844 --> 00:21:46,664
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he's Canadian.

314
00:21:47,944 --> 00:21:49,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that there's anything wrong with that.

315
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Whenever you make a mistake, just pretend you're Canadian.

316
00:21:53,325 --> 00:21:53,905
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Canadian.

317
00:21:53,965 --> 00:21:54,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I fucked up.

318
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:56,926
[SPEAKER_06]: No one expects you to be smart.

319
00:21:57,746 --> 00:22:00,466
[SPEAKER_13]: You should put the right emphasis on the correct syllable.

320
00:22:07,508 --> 00:22:08,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, street blowjobs!

321
00:22:11,405 --> 00:22:15,287
[SPEAKER_13]: And that guy looks happy because he's thinking about his blowjob that he's getting right then.

322
00:22:15,307 --> 00:22:18,928
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it attached to his ass?

323
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:29,392
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking about the new intro and all the clips from Jamie I can grab.

324
00:22:29,412 --> 00:22:30,293
[SPEAKER_13]: We get to watch blowjobs.

325
00:22:37,401 --> 00:22:59,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the show just isn't the show without porn Wait, so you actually clicked on a pop-up ad And now we're going to see some street blowjobs This is why you told your mom not to listen That's why she told her mom not to listen Yeah Well, this works Give me street blowjobs Winif sucks my ass That's why you're not supposed to use Winif Did Winif just freeze on you?

326
00:22:59,998 --> 00:23:03,421
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we'll fix that problem He's a media player That's what I was going to do

327
00:23:05,464 --> 00:23:07,988
[SPEAKER_13]: In the meantime, I will do a song and dance that none of you will see or hear.

328
00:23:09,991 --> 00:23:10,431
[SPEAKER_13]: It's in my head.

329
00:23:10,471 --> 00:23:11,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful, beautiful.

330
00:23:12,494 --> 00:23:13,976
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob did a nice dance last night.

331
00:23:13,996 --> 00:23:17,882
[SPEAKER_13]: Pirouetting across the screen in a tutu.

332
00:23:18,002 --> 00:23:20,326
[SPEAKER_05]: I have never had so many people yelling at me.

333
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:21,690
[SPEAKER_05]: in a tutu.

334
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Come to think of it, I've never worn a tutu before last night.

335
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:27,252
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't really a tutu, but you should have worn at least the Frank wig or something.

336
00:23:27,912 --> 00:23:30,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I should have had a wig, but... You were still fabulous.

337
00:23:30,153 --> 00:23:32,473
[SPEAKER_05]: We were trying to dig up a wig backstage, we couldn't find one.

338
00:23:32,513 --> 00:23:34,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we literally pulled that routine out of our ass.

339
00:23:34,714 --> 00:23:35,474
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what's ironic?

340
00:23:35,494 --> 00:23:37,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know where my outfit for last night... They tried to get me up there.

341
00:23:38,715 --> 00:23:39,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they try?

342
00:23:39,935 --> 00:23:42,396
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, Lindsay tried to get me to be Veronica.

343
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:45,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Lindsay doesn't know that you went backstage.

344
00:23:45,037 --> 00:23:45,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I told her...

345
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:51,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

346
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:54,260
[SPEAKER_14]: So what are you, uh, shopping for?

347
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,563
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just trying to browse and stuff, dude.

348
00:23:58,583 --> 00:23:59,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

349
00:23:59,103 --> 00:23:59,884
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

350
00:23:59,924 --> 00:24:01,225
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, listen, I'm gonna be honest with you.

351
00:24:01,325 --> 00:24:03,686
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you want to, uh, be interested in making a little extra money?

352
00:24:03,706 --> 00:24:06,408
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, to help you out with your shopping.

353
00:24:06,428 --> 00:24:08,109
[SPEAKER_14]: Dude, I'm pretty set with my shopping time.

354
00:24:08,129 --> 00:24:08,469
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah?

355
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:08,689
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

356
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:12,124
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

357
00:24:13,505 --> 00:24:14,065
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright then.

358
00:24:14,845 --> 00:24:15,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, that looks like Arden Fair.

359
00:24:17,026 --> 00:24:17,906
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my god, it does!

360
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,347
[SPEAKER_14]: Now I'm following you.

361
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:22,807
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of looking for some company.

362
00:24:22,847 --> 00:24:25,128
[SPEAKER_14]: Just wondering if you're interested.

363
00:24:25,148 --> 00:24:27,409
[SPEAKER_14]: What do I have in mind?

364
00:24:27,689 --> 00:24:28,269
[SPEAKER_14]: It's almost over.

365
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:29,509
[SPEAKER_14]: That's enough time to blow it off.

366
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:31,410
Oh, but...

367
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:44,892
[SPEAKER_05]: So, like, out of that whole thing, there were, like, maybe two seconds of a blowjob.

368
00:24:44,912 --> 00:24:47,835
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, you should send that to... Obviously an actress.

369
00:24:48,396 --> 00:24:49,657
[SPEAKER_05]: You should send that to Evan for a pre-show.

370
00:24:49,877 --> 00:24:52,860
[SPEAKER_05]: That totally... I look like... I swear to God that's a mall I've been to.

371
00:24:53,321 --> 00:24:54,662
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was one in L.A., though.

372
00:24:54,762 --> 00:24:56,404
[SPEAKER_05]: I reckon... No, this is the sad thing.

373
00:24:56,444 --> 00:24:58,446
[SPEAKER_05]: This shows you, like, what a queer I am, okay?

374
00:24:58,827 --> 00:25:01,209
[SPEAKER_05]: I recognize the Campbell's store in the background.

375
00:25:10,206 --> 00:25:13,789
[SPEAKER_07]: I want my old pop-up blocker back because this one sucks ass.

376
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:14,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

377
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,353
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, while you're on that site, get me the one for Nero.

378
00:25:18,373 --> 00:25:21,235
[SPEAKER_05]: I already have it.

379
00:25:21,335 --> 00:25:22,496
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, for the Nero 5.

380
00:25:22,556 --> 00:25:25,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, anyway, what were we talking about before we started talking about sex?

381
00:25:25,639 --> 00:25:26,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, our moms.

382
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:31,764
[SPEAKER_13]: Because without that and our mom, we wouldn't be here today.

383
00:25:31,784 --> 00:25:35,447
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, we were having a cool conversation though at that truck stop.

384
00:25:36,108 --> 00:25:36,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-huh.

385
00:25:37,191 --> 00:25:37,611
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

386
00:25:37,631 --> 00:25:38,631
[SPEAKER_06]: The Silver Skillet.

387
00:25:38,651 --> 00:25:40,152
[SPEAKER_13]: Truck stops, blowjobs, and your mom.

388
00:25:41,252 --> 00:25:42,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Truck stops, blowjobs, and your mom.

389
00:25:42,773 --> 00:25:44,513
[SPEAKER_13]: Some people we know were likely conceived.

390
00:25:46,034 --> 00:25:50,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Only on Orange Lounge Radio where you hear truck stops, blowjobs, and your mother all in the same sentence.

391
00:25:50,555 --> 00:25:57,037
[SPEAKER_13]: We're talking about life being a sexually transmitted fatal disease that's hereditary.

392
00:25:59,857 --> 00:26:00,778
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the secret of life?

393
00:26:01,738 --> 00:26:04,619
[SPEAKER_13]: It is a sexually transmitted fatal disease that's hereditary.

394
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,662
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

395
00:26:25,643 --> 00:26:26,244
[SPEAKER_13]: www.DarkSakura.com

396
00:26:45,693 --> 00:26:47,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God, that is an old people's store.

397
00:26:47,434 --> 00:26:48,515
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know people's stuff.

398
00:26:48,615 --> 00:26:55,799
[SPEAKER_13]: But, like, you can, if you need to get, you know, like, toothbrushes and all your drugstore needs there, it's really cheap, and you can get prescriptions, they're cheap, too.

399
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:07,506
[SPEAKER_06]: If that's the only store where you walk in, and you have lawn furniture, lawn care, you turn the corner, you have herbal, like, stuff, and then you go back around, and you see nothing but prune juice and diapers.

400
00:27:08,988 --> 00:27:13,232
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's like the whole section dedicated to soy and wild yam products.

401
00:27:24,844 --> 00:27:26,084
[SPEAKER_13]: For women who need their estrogen.

402
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:27,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Spam, spam, spam, spamity spams.

403
00:27:28,225 --> 00:27:28,865
[SPEAKER_13]: No, wild yam.

404
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:32,486
[SPEAKER_13]: Women can take it when they're going through menopause to help with hot flashes.

405
00:27:33,626 --> 00:27:36,566
[SPEAKER_13]: See, something that none of you people probably knew.

406
00:27:36,666 --> 00:27:37,787
[SPEAKER_13]: I worked at GNC for a long time.

407
00:27:37,847 --> 00:27:39,347
[SPEAKER_13]: I needed to know.

408
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,988
[SPEAKER_13]: Trust me, women, you're going to get through menopause in one day.

409
00:27:42,088 --> 00:27:43,268
[SPEAKER_13]: Mine's 20 years off.

410
00:27:46,849 --> 00:27:48,149
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm never having kids either.

411
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:52,772
[SPEAKER_13]: Dear Women, this is Jamie's herbal tip of the day.

412
00:27:52,792 --> 00:27:56,632
[SPEAKER_13]: You smoke the weed, not eat it.

413
00:28:00,993 --> 00:28:04,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody in the chat room is insinuating that I have that not-so-fresh feeling.

414
00:28:05,034 --> 00:28:05,454
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't.

415
00:28:06,274 --> 00:28:09,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been feeling a little... I wouldn't say I don't feel not-so-fresh.

416
00:28:09,615 --> 00:28:11,215
[SPEAKER_05]: I just feel not-so-sleepy.

417
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:15,576
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that Frank would have been in a better mood if he had feminine wipes.

418
00:28:18,311 --> 00:28:18,891
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

419
00:28:37,003 --> 00:28:38,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Has any of that stuff been washed?

420
00:28:39,164 --> 00:28:40,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the costumes?

421
00:28:40,505 --> 00:28:43,908
[SPEAKER_05]: They wash them, they don't wash them every week, but they wash them like once a month.

422
00:28:44,248 --> 00:28:48,030
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, because I was going to say, it's probably a good idea.

423
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:49,731
[SPEAKER_05]: I do wash my underwear.

424
00:28:49,952 --> 00:28:51,092
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I wasn't talking about your underwear.

425
00:28:51,112 --> 00:28:51,893
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't care about your underwear.

426
00:28:52,533 --> 00:28:54,214
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to wear itchy underwear, you can.

427
00:28:54,675 --> 00:28:55,775
[SPEAKER_13]: That's your prerogative.

428
00:28:56,856 --> 00:28:58,777
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking about... That's my right as an American.

429
00:28:59,418 --> 00:29:03,581
[SPEAKER_05]: If I want to wear dirty underwear in public, you can't stop me.

430
00:29:03,661 --> 00:29:04,881
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we'll buy you panty liners.

431
00:29:04,901 --> 00:29:05,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

432
00:29:07,606 --> 00:29:08,327
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, neighbors.

433
00:29:09,968 --> 00:29:11,008
[SPEAKER_13]: Now we know why.

434
00:29:11,629 --> 00:29:12,970
[SPEAKER_13]: Ran moves in, they move out.

435
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:16,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what are you doing?

436
00:29:17,793 --> 00:29:24,037
[SPEAKER_07]: I was getting my Acid 4 to work because I upgraded my computer and I'll be talking about that later.

437
00:29:25,057 --> 00:29:29,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Go A. Oh, are you going to make the A speed remix here?

438
00:29:30,341 --> 00:29:31,762
[SPEAKER_05]: The A Naoki remix here?

439
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:37,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, no, I have to find it on the internet, because I think I know a place where it might be.

440
00:29:37,972 --> 00:29:43,075
[SPEAKER_13]: He's gonna download it from mbz.com, you know, my bet's owed.

441
00:29:46,136 --> 00:29:52,599
[SPEAKER_13]: See, I could probably sit on a record and fart out a better remix.

442
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:54,299
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a record player, come over here.

443
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,440
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not gonna sit on his record player.

444
00:29:57,501 --> 00:29:59,082
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't sit on the record player, I sit on the record.

445
00:29:59,102 --> 00:29:59,862
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

446
00:30:02,288 --> 00:30:04,049
[SPEAKER_13]: You missed movie night last week.

447
00:30:04,709 --> 00:30:06,510
[SPEAKER_13]: When we watched a trauma movie.

448
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:07,390
[SPEAKER_13]: When was movie night?

449
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:08,691
[SPEAKER_13]: At Evans.

450
00:30:09,231 --> 00:30:09,971
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, what did you guys watch?

451
00:30:10,551 --> 00:30:11,952
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know what the name of the movie was.

452
00:30:12,232 --> 00:30:12,892
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I don't remember.

453
00:30:13,212 --> 00:30:17,294
[SPEAKER_13]: But it was one of those trauma movies where they get all these... No, it was Catholic Schoolgirl Hell.

454
00:30:18,134 --> 00:30:18,834
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the name of the movie?

455
00:30:18,954 --> 00:30:19,295
[SPEAKER_05]: I think.

456
00:30:19,355 --> 00:30:19,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

457
00:30:20,155 --> 00:30:24,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Where they go into this house, but there were no boobs, and there was, you know, the blood was made out of A1.

458
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:35,402
[SPEAKER_13]: But, like, they go in this house, and, like, this little boy goes in first, on there, and he comes out and has a seizure and goes in the hospital.

459
00:30:36,542 --> 00:30:46,807
[SPEAKER_13]: And then these girls go in, because the man who lived in the house died, and the girls go in to catalog the paintings and things with this nun.

460
00:30:46,867 --> 00:30:47,507
[SPEAKER_13]: The nun was cool.

461
00:30:49,528 --> 00:30:52,349
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet, like, that little kid went into a seizure because a priest touched him.

462
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:53,450
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

463
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,911
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god, the acting in that was so horrible.

464
00:30:56,971 --> 00:31:03,054
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, like, no one died cool except for the girl who got caught in a meat hook, but all they showed was her feet with A1 dripping down her feet.

465
00:31:04,515 --> 00:31:05,775
[SPEAKER_13]: And one girl got electrocuted.

466
00:31:06,476 --> 00:31:06,916
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.

467
00:31:06,976 --> 00:31:09,277
[SPEAKER_13]: Another one got pulled into the swamp and some guy got run over.

468
00:31:11,931 --> 00:31:19,037
[SPEAKER_05]: My friend Garrett has this trauma movie, Killer Condom, that he's been trying to get us to watch that for weeks and weeks.

469
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:21,339
[SPEAKER_05]: We never seem to get around to watching it.

470
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:23,861
[SPEAKER_05]: There's always something better to do, like play poppin' music or something.

471
00:31:24,321 --> 00:31:26,383
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're going to watch Killer Condom one of these nights.

472
00:31:26,403 --> 00:31:27,164
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll have to come watch.

473
00:31:27,324 --> 00:31:28,965
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure Garrett would love to have you come over and watch it.

474
00:31:29,986 --> 00:31:30,547
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you do now?

475
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:37,623
[SPEAKER_07]: My headphones are attached to a giant pile of cords.

476
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:45,166
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like what Loki's doing right now is pulling out the Christmas tree lights at Christmas time and finding they're just in one giant pile.

477
00:31:45,186 --> 00:31:45,727
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

478
00:31:45,847 --> 00:31:49,688
[SPEAKER_13]: In my house, that never was an issue because I was evil with the twisty ties.

479
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:54,791
[SPEAKER_13]: I always hated pulling out the lights and having them be all tangly.

480
00:31:55,901 --> 00:31:59,183
[SPEAKER_13]: I would wrap them in a circle and bunch them together and twisty tie them.

481
00:31:59,604 --> 00:32:01,285
[SPEAKER_05]: You're so anally retentively fun.

482
00:32:01,685 --> 00:32:02,746
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd bite my ass.

483
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:04,347
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll show you anal retentive.

484
00:32:05,647 --> 00:32:09,290
[SPEAKER_13]: See what happens when you have a steel-toed boot shoved up your butt from kicking?

485
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:10,971
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll be coughing up nails.

486
00:32:13,793 --> 00:32:17,435
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I've ever heard you so, like, threatening on this show before.

487
00:32:17,795 --> 00:32:19,316
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a badass bitch tonight.

488
00:32:20,157 --> 00:32:20,397
[SPEAKER_13]: I am.

489
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:21,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you are.

490
00:32:21,881 --> 00:32:22,882
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't mean that, by the way.

491
00:32:23,563 --> 00:32:24,363
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean it with puppies.

492
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, you're going to kick puppy in the ass?

493
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:30,290
[SPEAKER_13]: No!

494
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,231
[SPEAKER_05]: What did he do to you?

495
00:32:31,331 --> 00:32:32,452
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a mean old lady.

496
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,234
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm going to get puppy a puppy.

497
00:32:34,915 --> 00:32:35,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you going to get puppy a puppy?

498
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,738
[SPEAKER_13]: When he has somewhere he can have a puppy.

499
00:32:38,888 --> 00:32:39,709
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very nice of you.

500
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:40,869
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure he appreciates that.

501
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:45,212
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we have the little frowny face from Puppy in the chat room as the buffer hits him.

502
00:32:45,392 --> 00:32:47,074
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not kicking Puppy.

503
00:32:47,814 --> 00:32:49,375
[SPEAKER_13]: I like Puppy right there.

504
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:54,579
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

505
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:56,860
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge goes to Korea next week.

506
00:33:00,022 --> 00:33:00,623
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't go there.

507
00:33:00,663 --> 00:33:01,303
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

508
00:33:01,924 --> 00:33:02,304
[SPEAKER_05]: You did.

509
00:33:02,324 --> 00:33:02,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I did, I did.

510
00:33:03,945 --> 00:33:05,366
[SPEAKER_13]: Here, have some more hazelnut bites.

511
00:33:05,446 --> 00:33:06,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, give me.

512
00:33:06,427 --> 00:33:06,827
[SPEAKER_05]: What are these?

513
00:33:06,907 --> 00:33:07,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's read.

514
00:33:07,848 --> 00:33:07,948
What?

515
00:33:10,336 --> 00:33:11,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Loki's ass.

516
00:33:12,738 --> 00:33:13,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Oops.

517
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,562
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't throw nuts at his ass.

518
00:33:17,582 --> 00:33:19,824
[SPEAKER_13]: I threw nut cream at his ass.

519
00:33:21,465 --> 00:33:21,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

520
00:33:22,946 --> 00:33:29,752
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Loker Quadratini Hazelnut Premium Wafer Cookies, and they're filled with hazelnut cream.

521
00:33:29,772 --> 00:33:30,512
[SPEAKER_05]: They're European.

522
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:31,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one in Italy.

523
00:33:36,617 --> 00:33:37,758
[SPEAKER_13]: I got them at the old people's store.

524
00:33:38,138 --> 00:33:38,358
[SPEAKER_13]: They were $2.00.

525
00:33:39,335 --> 00:33:40,696
[SPEAKER_05]: They look like old people food.

526
00:33:41,456 --> 00:33:42,537
[SPEAKER_13]: No, they're international.

527
00:33:42,997 --> 00:33:44,038
[SPEAKER_13]: If you eat them, you're cultured.

528
00:33:45,939 --> 00:33:47,180
[SPEAKER_13]: You sure could use it.

529
00:33:50,382 --> 00:33:51,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel any culture.

530
00:33:56,746 --> 00:33:57,947
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, look.

531
00:33:58,227 --> 00:33:59,908
[SPEAKER_13]: Hentai done by the guy who did Tenchi.

532
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:01,109
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that?

533
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:02,449
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know, but I want to watch it.

534
00:34:02,469 --> 00:34:02,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Masquerade?

535
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what it's called?

536
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,851
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I want to finish watching Break-In.

537
00:34:05,538 --> 00:34:08,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's read what Masquerade is about.

538
00:34:08,939 --> 00:34:11,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Endless passion, insatiable desire.

539
00:34:11,421 --> 00:34:15,222
[SPEAKER_05]: 19-year-old Gen's family... I've watched this one.

540
00:34:15,302 --> 00:34:21,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, it's about this chick that's going after this one guy because he has, what was it, the essence of permanence or something like that.

541
00:34:22,265 --> 00:34:22,765
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to watch it.

542
00:34:50,472 --> 00:34:51,113
[SPEAKER_05]: That was beautiful.

543
00:34:51,273 --> 00:34:52,334
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to finish watching Break-In.

544
00:34:53,154 --> 00:34:54,495
[SPEAKER_13]: We were watching Break-In before the show.

545
00:34:54,656 --> 00:34:56,237
[SPEAKER_05]: We can finish watching Break-In after the show.

546
00:34:56,857 --> 00:35:00,781
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we start watching Break-In, there's not going to be a show and our listeners will get mad and they'll write us death threats.

547
00:35:01,762 --> 00:35:02,262
[SPEAKER_13]: No, they won't.

548
00:35:03,063 --> 00:35:04,524
[SPEAKER_13]: They'll just whine online.

549
00:35:04,564 --> 00:35:07,206
[SPEAKER_13]: Listen to the cool music.

550
00:35:07,226 --> 00:35:08,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, lots of cool music.

551
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:11,770
[SPEAKER_13]: They can listen along.

552
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,211
[SPEAKER_05]: What other 80s movies do you love?

553
00:35:14,472 --> 00:35:15,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than Break-In.

554
00:35:15,834 --> 00:35:18,596
[SPEAKER_13]: Break into Electric Boogaloo I found the sound card!

555
00:35:40,191 --> 00:35:41,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you see how old they were?

556
00:35:42,093 --> 00:35:44,175
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think they had too much sex on that bed.

557
00:35:44,195 --> 00:35:46,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because they're old doesn't mean they don't have sex.

558
00:35:46,497 --> 00:35:49,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's like 50% of the old people population actually do.

559
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,881
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck am I talking about?

560
00:35:50,901 --> 00:35:52,143
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot of old people having sex.

561
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,500
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm weird.

562
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,941
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you're really pulling down the quality of this show.

563
00:35:58,502 --> 00:35:59,863
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what interns are supposed to do.

564
00:35:59,923 --> 00:36:03,944
[SPEAKER_06]: All I did was sat there and just said everything you guys said over and over again.

565
00:36:03,984 --> 00:36:12,548
[SPEAKER_06]: So you guys talked about the truck stop, some others, and the blowjobs, and how we were all bored at truck stops or something like that.

566
00:36:12,588 --> 00:36:13,488
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's cool when we do it.

567
00:36:14,349 --> 00:36:14,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine.

568
00:36:15,669 --> 00:36:16,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Go download more blowjobs.

569
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Go hang out at a truck stop.

570
00:36:21,816 --> 00:36:22,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

571
00:36:23,597 --> 00:36:24,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

572
00:36:24,257 --> 00:36:25,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I think now is a good time to take a break.

573
00:36:26,578 --> 00:36:26,898
[SPEAKER_05]: No?

574
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:27,458
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you doing?

575
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:30,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.

576
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:33,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

577
00:36:33,499 --> 00:36:35,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see here.

578
00:36:39,981 --> 00:36:41,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this going to sound like something Twin did?

579
00:36:44,162 --> 00:36:44,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

580
00:36:45,042 --> 00:36:46,363
[SPEAKER_13]: He downloaded it, Rob.

581
00:36:46,423 --> 00:36:47,063
[SPEAKER_13]: He downloaded it.

582
00:36:47,984 --> 00:36:49,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Download it, yes.

583
00:36:49,765 --> 00:36:51,887
[SPEAKER_13]: Off of LBZ.com.

584
00:36:52,548 --> 00:36:54,649
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to fix something because, hold on.

585
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'll play it after the break.

586
00:36:56,751 --> 00:36:58,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we're going to, this is something to look forward to.

587
00:37:00,034 --> 00:37:01,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it the Naoki remix?

588
00:37:01,475 --> 00:37:03,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Did Naoki do some pew-pews in this song and stuff?

589
00:37:03,617 --> 00:37:04,377
[SPEAKER_11]: No, Paul Terry did.

590
00:37:04,677 --> 00:37:07,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

591
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we'll hear that.

592
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:10,762
[SPEAKER_05]: We have that to look forward to after the break.

593
00:37:11,783 --> 00:37:16,006
[SPEAKER_05]: When we come back from the break, we're going to talk about B3, we're going to talk about E3, or we're going to talk about G4.

594
00:37:18,089 --> 00:37:18,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Play Liar Liar

595
00:37:41,503 --> 00:37:44,891
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't done that in a long time, so we'll talk about Pump It Up.

596
00:37:44,931 --> 00:37:45,472
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be fun.

597
00:37:46,394 --> 00:37:47,717
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back in a little bit.

598
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:48,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy.

599
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:57,936
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

00:40:15,561 --> 00:40:16,522
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for watching!

602
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:30,420
Thank you for watching!

603
00:43:09,807 --> 00:43:15,452
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Dance Band lighting music in Morse Show?

604
00:43:15,752 --> 00:43:22,898
[SPEAKER_01]: The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

605
00:43:23,238 --> 00:43:25,200
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unearthly.

606
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,163
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like being at a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

607
00:43:30,034 --> 00:43:32,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

608
00:43:32,414 --> 00:43:33,655
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to find that movie again.

609
00:43:34,235 --> 00:43:35,475
[SPEAKER_09]: That thing was freaking hilarious.

610
00:43:35,575 --> 00:43:36,315
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty funny.

611
00:43:36,555 --> 00:43:38,416
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember it was on Konami's official site, I think.

612
00:43:38,956 --> 00:43:40,476
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was linked from there somewhere.

613
00:43:40,896 --> 00:43:43,557
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Loki, did you finish downloading your A remix?

614
00:43:43,737 --> 00:43:45,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I had to figure out what I did.

615
00:43:46,397 --> 00:43:50,658
[SPEAKER_07]: I had to figure out what I did because I had to plug in my headphones just to make sure that it was the right copy, you know.

616
00:43:51,818 --> 00:43:53,258
[SPEAKER_07]: So I had to hook it back up.

617
00:43:53,318 --> 00:43:54,339
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll just take one second.

618
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:56,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Alrighty.

619
00:43:56,139 --> 00:43:56,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on!

620
00:43:59,048 --> 00:44:00,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone seen any good movies lately?

621
00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:01,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, no.

622
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:02,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you not seen X2 yet?

623
00:44:03,331 --> 00:44:03,531
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

624
00:44:03,771 --> 00:44:04,272
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not yet?

625
00:44:04,952 --> 00:44:06,013
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take you later.

626
00:44:06,674 --> 00:44:06,914
[SPEAKER_05]: When?

627
00:44:06,994 --> 00:44:07,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I want to go see it again.

628
00:44:08,034 --> 00:44:08,315
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

629
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:10,776
[SPEAKER_05]: But then The Matrix is coming out and I have to go see that too.

630
00:44:11,817 --> 00:44:12,258
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know.

631
00:44:12,278 --> 00:44:14,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I want to go see X2 again for Iceman.

632
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:19,743
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, I'm going for my fuzzy elf.

633
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Nightcrawler Nightcrawler

634
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:36,621
[SPEAKER_13]: When they were cool.

635
00:44:37,321 --> 00:44:38,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we need to go see.

636
00:44:38,782 --> 00:44:40,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler?

637
00:44:40,263 --> 00:44:41,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, he's great.

638
00:44:42,105 --> 00:44:42,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Fabulous.

639
00:44:42,345 --> 00:44:43,946
[SPEAKER_13]: Did he keep him coming and coming and coming?

640
00:44:44,026 --> 00:44:45,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, he kept us coming.

641
00:44:45,167 --> 00:44:45,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

642
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:47,008
[SPEAKER_13]: So take me tomorrow.

643
00:44:47,228 --> 00:44:59,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, now, now, I don't know if this is a fake one because, you know, I got it off of MGZ and, you know, but I know that they're very reliable with, you know, all these breaking, you know, songs just like M, you know, from Taka.

644
00:44:59,877 --> 00:45:00,778
[SPEAKER_07]: They were the first to have it.

645
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:01,619
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um...

646
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:06,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go with A. It's a remix by Naoki.

647
00:45:06,282 --> 00:45:07,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's amazing.

648
00:45:07,243 --> 00:45:08,764
[SPEAKER_07]: This guy is just remixing shit left and right.

649
00:45:08,784 --> 00:45:11,526
[SPEAKER_13]: This is going to be in one of the Night Style Expert Courses, right?

650
00:45:11,606 --> 00:45:19,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, an exclusive Night Style Oni Challenge Mode Hidden Basic Expert Song.

651
00:45:20,792 --> 00:45:21,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it, Loki.

652
00:45:22,173 --> 00:45:23,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Do it all night.

653
00:45:30,552 --> 00:45:31,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is fucking great.

654
00:45:35,741 --> 00:45:36,963
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that drum beat.

655
00:45:36,983 --> 00:45:38,646
[SPEAKER_02]: There's gonna be some mean scratches.

656
00:45:48,903 --> 00:45:51,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, ow, oh, that's a cool part.

657
00:45:51,325 --> 00:45:53,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, that was a freeze right there.

658
00:45:54,526 --> 00:45:58,189
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but they're going to have exclusive freezes in Night Style.

659
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,490
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to turn the turntable over and over and over again.

660
00:46:03,292 --> 00:46:05,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this is going to be some mean key presses right here.

661
00:46:05,553 --> 00:46:08,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet you this is going to be the first eight-star song.

662
00:46:08,555 --> 00:46:18,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, this is great.

663
00:46:21,736 --> 00:46:22,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

664
00:46:23,696 --> 00:46:25,637
[SPEAKER_05]: An Orange Lounge Radio exclusive.

665
00:46:25,937 --> 00:46:30,298
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I wonder if somebody submitted that to the Bomani-style remix contest.

666
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:32,898
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, I think we need to do it on their behalf.

667
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:38,119
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

668
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:39,259
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't really think that was knocky.

669
00:46:39,279 --> 00:46:40,760
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that it was good cool.

670
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,580
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's sad?

671
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,840
[SPEAKER_07]: My sound card sucks ass and is brand new.

672
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:48,421
[SPEAKER_07]: I am so... I'll leave it for later.

673
00:46:49,178 --> 00:46:49,898
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta make a list.

674
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I can do that.

675
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:54,301
[SPEAKER_13]: Your sound card is number one in Italy.

676
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:54,941
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

677
00:47:02,305 --> 00:47:05,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Your sound card is the sexiest bean tadpole on the planet.

678
00:47:09,549 --> 00:47:10,690
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope somebody got that joke.

679
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:12,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Your house is hot.

680
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:12,731
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

681
00:47:12,771 --> 00:47:16,873
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we ought to enter that remix and say it's twin, and I bet people would believe it.

682
00:47:19,264 --> 00:47:22,086
[SPEAKER_13]: No, because Twen's not talented enough to put another beat behind it.

683
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,368
[SPEAKER_13]: I bet he's listening.

684
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,190
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to say hello?

685
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:28,211
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, Twen!

686
00:47:32,374 --> 00:47:34,536
[SPEAKER_05]: With love, Orange Lawns Radio, XXOO.

687
00:47:35,537 --> 00:47:37,018
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm still, like, getting back in the chat room.

688
00:47:40,921 --> 00:47:41,761
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a good laugh.

689
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:46,451
[SPEAKER_05]: We're having a day on Orange Lounge Radio.

690
00:47:46,891 --> 00:47:48,932
[SPEAKER_13]: This is so different being here.

691
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:50,253
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like sitting on a couch.

692
00:47:51,073 --> 00:47:52,254
[SPEAKER_13]: I was laying down on the couch.

693
00:47:52,714 --> 00:47:53,975
[SPEAKER_13]: You have a vanilla Coke?

694
00:47:55,195 --> 00:47:55,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a vanilla Coke?

695
00:47:56,376 --> 00:47:58,176
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gone.

696
00:47:59,777 --> 00:48:00,177
[SPEAKER_20]: Shit!

697
00:48:04,659 --> 00:48:06,480
[SPEAKER_05]: The vanilla Coke jumped out and attacked my phone.

698
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,461
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought there was still stuff in it.

699
00:48:08,421 --> 00:48:10,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob, you need a trash can by your computer.

700
00:48:10,646 --> 00:48:13,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I can get up and walk to the kitchen.

701
00:48:13,406 --> 00:48:14,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I am capable.

702
00:48:15,207 --> 00:48:16,167
[SPEAKER_09]: But you'd rather not.

703
00:48:16,187 --> 00:48:20,228
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd say next break we open the door to let air out.

704
00:48:20,248 --> 00:48:21,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we can open the window to let air out.

705
00:48:22,248 --> 00:48:23,028
[SPEAKER_05]: To let air out in here.

706
00:48:23,308 --> 00:48:24,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Or we just turn on the fan.

707
00:48:26,329 --> 00:48:27,409
[SPEAKER_13]: Save electricity, open the door.

708
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:31,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

709
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:36,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they're saying in the chat room that we were dissing Italy.

710
00:48:36,591 --> 00:48:36,991
[SPEAKER_05]: We weren't.

711
00:48:37,031 --> 00:48:38,471
[SPEAKER_05]: We were reading it off a bag of cookies.

712
00:48:38,491 --> 00:48:38,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

713
00:48:39,218 --> 00:48:41,100
[SPEAKER_05]: This bag of cookies is number one in Italy.

714
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:43,182
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to get the webcam.

715
00:48:43,322 --> 00:48:44,323
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we don't need the webcam hooked up.

716
00:48:44,343 --> 00:48:45,023
[SPEAKER_13]: We need a scanner.

717
00:48:46,825 --> 00:48:48,747
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll scan this when I get home and put it up.

718
00:48:49,007 --> 00:48:50,729
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll figure out something creative with the webcam.

719
00:48:50,749 --> 00:48:54,672
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what we're going to do is we're going to have the webcam and we'll just put it in the corner and point it at a wall.

720
00:48:54,692 --> 00:48:56,374
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my God, it really is written in Italian.

721
00:48:56,714 --> 00:48:58,776
[SPEAKER_13]: And Chinese.

722
00:48:58,956 --> 00:48:59,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, don't open it now.

723
00:49:00,538 --> 00:49:03,921
[SPEAKER_13]: And... Holy crap, it's written in Hebrew.

724
00:49:05,603 --> 00:49:06,404
[SPEAKER_13]: I kid you not.

725
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:10,606
[SPEAKER_13]: The stuff about the cookies is written in Hebrew.

726
00:49:11,227 --> 00:49:11,427
[SPEAKER_13]: Look.

727
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:16,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you read it for us?

728
00:49:16,951 --> 00:49:17,391
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck no.

729
00:49:20,111 --> 00:49:26,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, as we promised, there's many things coming up this week that's exciting.

730
00:49:26,773 --> 00:49:28,793
[SPEAKER_05]: E3 being the big one that's on everybody's minds.

731
00:49:28,813 --> 00:49:33,274
[SPEAKER_05]: The Electronic Entertainment Expo, or maybe I got that backwards.

732
00:49:33,294 --> 00:49:34,955
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really give a shit, because I'm not going.

733
00:49:35,975 --> 00:49:37,816
[SPEAKER_05]: And Jamie, unfortunately, isn't going.

734
00:49:38,176 --> 00:49:38,776
[SPEAKER_05]: I could have.

735
00:49:38,836 --> 00:49:40,416
[SPEAKER_05]: She has that job thing going on.

736
00:49:42,217 --> 00:49:43,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Zero is not going.

737
00:49:45,038 --> 00:49:46,558
[SPEAKER_05]: And Loki is not going either.

738
00:49:47,463 --> 00:49:49,203
[SPEAKER_13]: But Dan always brings back new stuff for you guys.

739
00:49:50,124 --> 00:49:53,004
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, he hasn't been there before we did from that manager meeting he went to.

740
00:49:53,784 --> 00:50:00,266
[SPEAKER_05]: But E3 is going to be like this big fat deal, and we're going to get a lot of Imani news next week, which is interesting because we don't really have a show next Sunday.

741
00:50:01,606 --> 00:50:01,946
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

742
00:50:02,426 --> 00:50:13,149
[SPEAKER_05]: But in two weeks we'll be back with episode number 45, our season 3 premiere, and we will have lots to talk about from E3 because in those two weeks there's going to be so much news it's going to make you cry.

743
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:15,311
[SPEAKER_05]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

744
00:50:38,155 --> 00:50:40,920
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to ask him to record a bunch of the stuff on the Bimani things for me.

745
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,584
[SPEAKER_05]: And Metal Gear Solid 3 is going to be a big thing too.

746
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:44,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, that was cool.

747
00:50:44,626 --> 00:50:46,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the trailer's out now.

748
00:50:46,569 --> 00:50:51,777
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also the new Metal Gear Solid for the GameCube that they're coming out with.

749
00:50:53,949 --> 00:50:55,730
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why I love my GameCube.

750
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:59,691
[SPEAKER_05]: My GameCube is my favorite system now, and I would buy that on the GameCube.

751
00:51:00,111 --> 00:51:06,272
[SPEAKER_07]: They said it was like Metal Gear Solid, the first one's story with the second one's graphics.

752
00:51:07,092 --> 00:51:07,853
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be cool.

753
00:51:08,013 --> 00:51:09,093
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it's supposed to be.

754
00:51:10,433 --> 00:51:12,834
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to know more about that Final Fantasy game they're doing for GameCube.

755
00:51:12,874 --> 00:51:13,614
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it doesn't suck.

756
00:51:13,694 --> 00:51:14,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Please don't suck.

757
00:51:14,594 --> 00:51:15,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Please don't suck.

758
00:51:15,774 --> 00:51:17,175
[SPEAKER_05]: And Mario Kart Double Dash.

759
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:17,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

760
00:51:19,056 --> 00:51:21,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Squeenix is back with Nintendo.

761
00:51:21,638 --> 00:51:25,382
[SPEAKER_05]: And I bet you they're going to show a lot of Final Fantasy XI stuff at E3.

762
00:51:26,322 --> 00:51:27,363
[SPEAKER_05]: Although it's already out in Japan.

763
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:28,024
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

764
00:51:28,744 --> 00:51:30,666
[SPEAKER_13]: My demo disc needs to hurry up and get to my house.

765
00:51:31,106 --> 00:51:32,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Will you have a demo disc of it coming?

766
00:51:32,708 --> 00:51:33,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I signed up for the beta.

767
00:51:34,449 --> 00:51:34,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah.

768
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:38,753
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm to be a beta tester for the PC version.

769
00:51:39,754 --> 00:51:44,418
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have a feeling that I'm going to get it because I've at least played every game out except for XI.

770
00:51:44,438 --> 00:51:44,498
[SPEAKER_13]: And...

771
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:52,801
[SPEAKER_13]: That and I've beta tested a bunch of other stuff, so I'm pretty sure to get it.

772
00:51:54,141 --> 00:51:55,382
[SPEAKER_13]: And Dan signed up for the PS2 one.

773
00:51:57,022 --> 00:51:57,322
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool.

774
00:51:57,622 --> 00:52:09,105
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just pissed, though, because I was thinking of getting the Japanese one when it came out, except that it would have been really expensive for me, because I would have had to get an external hard drive for my PS2, because I have a first model Japanese one.

775
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:15,627
[SPEAKER_13]: $200-something dollars still, and I refuse to shop at BuyRite, because they suck.

776
00:52:16,872 --> 00:52:20,755
[SPEAKER_05]: I was telling my friend Garrett about your Buy Right experiences because he thinks they suck too.

777
00:52:20,795 --> 00:52:22,176
[SPEAKER_05]: They did something to him that pissed him off.

778
00:52:24,397 --> 00:52:25,478
[SPEAKER_13]: They really suck a big ass.

779
00:52:25,658 --> 00:52:26,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Never shot from Buy Right.

780
00:52:26,979 --> 00:52:27,179
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

781
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:28,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you explain this to me?

782
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,462
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of know what it is, but I thought our listeners might benefit.

783
00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:37,066
[SPEAKER_05]: The difference between, because I know this is your beef with Buy Right, the difference between buying a game that's Asia and buying a game that's Japan.

784
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:50,429
[SPEAKER_13]: There's really not a difference in the game itself, but when you get your manual, it's going to be written all in, I think it's Mandarin Chinese, as opposed to being written in Japanese.

785
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:58,675
[SPEAKER_13]: And for me it was a big thing because I would have at least a chance of reading a Japanese manual instead of one written in Chinese.

786
00:52:59,556 --> 00:53:03,879
[SPEAKER_13]: And the other thing is that I could have gone to YesAsia and gotten it for $30 cheaper.

787
00:53:05,456 --> 00:53:08,219
[SPEAKER_13]: Instead, I paid more, and there it went.

788
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:10,440
[SPEAKER_05]: But I see that a lot.

789
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:15,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I was looking around at stuff on NCSX the other night, and they have Asia, Japan.

790
00:53:15,705 --> 00:53:18,628
[SPEAKER_05]: They have it pretty clearly defined, the differences between the two when you're buying them.

791
00:53:18,648 --> 00:53:20,369
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's why it's good to shop at NCSX.

792
00:53:20,549 --> 00:53:20,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

793
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:25,634
[SPEAKER_05]: But I was just, you know, I was kind of curious what the difference is, and, you know, I thought maybe our listeners could benefit from that, too.

794
00:53:26,314 --> 00:53:27,515
[SPEAKER_13]: They should just never shop from BuyRight.

795
00:53:27,775 --> 00:53:29,477
[SPEAKER_13]: And also, if you sign up for their mailing list at all.

796
00:53:30,057 --> 00:53:32,780
[SPEAKER_13]: Because somehow they signed me up for it when I emailed a question.

797
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:32,880
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

798
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,321
[SPEAKER_13]: I've submitted so many times.

799
00:53:36,661 --> 00:53:38,842
[SPEAKER_13]: Threaten legal action because you can actually sue them for that.

800
00:53:40,603 --> 00:53:41,903
[SPEAKER_13]: And they haven't removed me so I blocked.

801
00:53:42,123 --> 00:53:43,924
[SPEAKER_13]: That's part of the reason why my DarkSakura mail is blocked.

802
00:53:45,045 --> 00:53:53,948
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm actually going to get on the line one day and call them and tell them that if they do not remove my name for their mailing list that I am going to press charges.

803
00:53:54,509 --> 00:53:54,949
[SPEAKER_13]: And I will.

804
00:53:55,697 --> 00:54:01,679
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's going to be a law in California pretty soon about the whole you can sue them for $500 or something like that.

805
00:54:01,699 --> 00:54:02,319
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.

806
00:54:02,679 --> 00:54:06,440
[SPEAKER_05]: And you get $100 of that?

807
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,081
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, you get the state to give them a fine.

808
00:54:08,101 --> 00:54:10,341
[SPEAKER_05]: The state can fine them for that and you get $100 of that.

809
00:54:10,861 --> 00:54:11,422
[SPEAKER_13]: That's awesome.

810
00:54:12,842 --> 00:54:13,822
[SPEAKER_13]: All the spam lists?

811
00:54:14,082 --> 00:54:14,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-huh.

812
00:54:14,582 --> 00:54:14,903
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh-uh.

813
00:54:15,083 --> 00:54:16,463
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to save every last one of them.

814
00:54:19,064 --> 00:54:19,564
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll be rich.

815
00:54:20,037 --> 00:54:23,259
[SPEAKER_07]: C3 and D3 C4 blew up C3

816
00:54:51,167 --> 00:55:01,916
[SPEAKER_05]: B3 is this weekend and that's at Pier 39 in San Francisco.

817
00:55:02,617 --> 00:55:05,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Huge, huge DDR tournament is going to be taking place.

818
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:08,442
[SPEAKER_05]: There's people coming in from Seattle, SoCal.

819
00:55:08,702 --> 00:55:10,223
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the... Oh, Jamie's ringing.

820
00:55:10,243 --> 00:55:10,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie's ringing.

821
00:55:12,657 --> 00:55:15,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, moving on to a discussion about B3.

822
00:55:16,099 --> 00:55:24,843
[SPEAKER_05]: B3 is going to be this huge-ass tournament that's going on, and it's taking place in San Francisco on Pier 39, and they're having four or five competitions.

823
00:55:24,963 --> 00:55:31,686
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Perfect Attack, Freestyle, Dance Maniacs, and B-Mania 3.

824
00:55:33,027 --> 00:55:34,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there was something else going on.

825
00:55:34,307 --> 00:55:35,308
[SPEAKER_05]: I probably forgot.

826
00:55:35,508 --> 00:55:39,470
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can get onto DDR Freak and check the official tournament thread for more information on that.

827
00:55:41,508 --> 00:55:47,652
[SPEAKER_05]: and we will be broadcasting to you that weekend on Saturday for sure.

828
00:55:48,433 --> 00:55:50,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Sunday, hopefully, if we can get it to work out.

829
00:55:50,854 --> 00:55:53,496
[SPEAKER_05]: I just received some news we might not be able to get it to work out, but hopefully we do.

830
00:55:54,857 --> 00:55:56,778
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'll be coming to you all day long on Saturday for sure.

831
00:55:57,519 --> 00:55:59,760
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to have a really good location from what I understand.

832
00:56:00,221 --> 00:56:03,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to say anything to the listeners?

833
00:56:05,124 --> 00:56:06,205
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, wait, one second.

834
00:56:06,225 --> 00:56:07,586
[SPEAKER_13]: Say it one more time on the count of three, okay?

835
00:56:07,826 --> 00:56:08,786
[SPEAKER_13]: One, two, three.

836
00:56:09,347 --> 00:56:09,407
Hi.

837
00:56:13,391 --> 00:56:14,492
[SPEAKER_04]: I could barely hear it, yes.

838
00:56:14,912 --> 00:56:16,333
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you say it louder one more time?

839
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:20,235
[SPEAKER_13]: One, two, wait, wait, Dan, Dan, one more time.

840
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:22,376
[SPEAKER_13]: One, two, three.

841
00:56:23,396 --> 00:56:25,537
Orange Lounge Radio rocks!

842
00:56:25,977 --> 00:56:27,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good, very good.

843
00:56:27,298 --> 00:56:28,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Dan.

844
00:56:28,298 --> 00:56:28,659
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you.

845
00:56:28,679 --> 00:56:28,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

846
00:56:33,976 --> 00:56:34,817
[SPEAKER_13]: That was my Dan.

847
00:56:35,257 --> 00:56:36,398
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Jamie's Dan.

848
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:37,979
[SPEAKER_13]: My microphone's really loud now.

849
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:40,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Where were we?

850
00:56:40,542 --> 00:56:41,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, B3, all those competitions.

851
00:56:41,723 --> 00:56:44,025
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have a really good location Saturday from what I understand.

852
00:56:44,085 --> 00:56:44,805
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be awesome.

853
00:56:45,065 --> 00:56:47,327
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't freaking... Are they going to feed us?

854
00:56:48,128 --> 00:56:48,428
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

855
00:56:48,448 --> 00:56:53,833
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think they're going to feed us, but I hear we get other perks, but I can't say what those are yet, but I'll tell you off air.

856
00:56:54,654 --> 00:56:55,454
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some cool things.

857
00:56:55,634 --> 00:56:57,436
[SPEAKER_13]: So we get free manservants.

858
00:56:57,916 --> 00:56:57,976
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.

859
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:03,900
[SPEAKER_05]: We have intern zero.

860
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:05,402
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't need another manservant.

861
00:57:05,502 --> 00:57:07,323
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm talking about naked menservants.

862
00:57:08,664 --> 00:57:10,085
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm talking about harem men.

863
00:57:11,607 --> 00:57:15,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe we can talk puppy or something into being a manservant.

864
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:17,211
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want puppy to be a harem man.

865
00:57:17,231 --> 00:57:18,352
[SPEAKER_05]: I want my harem man to...

866
00:57:25,054 --> 00:57:26,755
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to have, like, incest on the trailer.

867
00:57:27,035 --> 00:57:29,455
[SPEAKER_05]: We're the Orange Lounge radio people.

868
00:57:29,495 --> 00:57:30,396
[SPEAKER_05]: We're celebrity staff.

869
00:57:30,416 --> 00:57:32,636
[SPEAKER_05]: We need people coming to our booth asking for autographs.

870
00:57:32,716 --> 00:57:34,697
[SPEAKER_05]: And we go, sorry, no time, no time.

871
00:57:34,737 --> 00:57:35,617
[SPEAKER_05]: See my publicist.

872
00:57:35,657 --> 00:57:35,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Call me.

873
00:57:36,017 --> 00:57:36,617
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do lunch.

874
00:57:36,697 --> 00:57:37,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Blah, blah, blah.

875
00:57:37,778 --> 00:57:40,338
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm still thinking about auctioning off my bat.

876
00:57:42,999 --> 00:57:43,479
[SPEAKER_05]: At the tournament?

877
00:57:43,499 --> 00:57:45,060
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe we should auction off my bat at the tournament.

878
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:47,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Aren't you going to be sad to see that go?

879
00:57:51,922 --> 00:57:52,722
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I will.

880
00:57:54,686 --> 00:57:57,528
[SPEAKER_13]: How could I ever consider getting rid of my beloved bat?

881
00:57:57,968 --> 00:57:59,149
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, they're moving tables now.

882
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye, neighbors!

883
00:58:01,891 --> 00:58:05,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we already have people in the chat room claiming dibs on the orange bat.

884
00:58:05,673 --> 00:58:07,014
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe look forward to that.

885
00:58:07,034 --> 00:58:08,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe we'll do a silent auction for my bat.

886
00:58:09,016 --> 00:58:10,136
[SPEAKER_13]: Are we giving away door prizes?

887
00:58:11,617 --> 00:58:11,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't know?

888
00:58:11,918 --> 00:58:12,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.

889
00:58:12,938 --> 00:58:13,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully a few.

890
00:58:13,499 --> 00:58:15,560
[SPEAKER_05]: We at least have that one box of stuff, right?

891
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:21,504
[SPEAKER_13]: The one that you wanted to... I think we should do a silent auction for the orange bat.

892
00:58:21,849 --> 00:58:23,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so you're thinking about signing an auction for your bat?

893
00:58:24,092 --> 00:58:24,912
[SPEAKER_13]: You should do one for yours.

894
00:58:25,173 --> 00:58:27,235
[SPEAKER_13]: We should auction off your bat too, signed by us.

895
00:58:28,136 --> 00:58:28,616
[SPEAKER_05]: We could do that.

896
00:58:28,657 --> 00:58:29,077
[SPEAKER_05]: The hosts.

897
00:58:29,417 --> 00:58:30,559
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you and I have to go get new bats.

898
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we'll do it, and then we can enter and do a routine.

899
00:58:35,084 --> 00:58:36,405
[SPEAKER_05]: At the biggest tournament in NorCal.

900
00:58:36,685 --> 00:58:36,845
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

901
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:41,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we're probably going to do a silent auction for Jamie's bat and my bat.

902
00:58:41,633 --> 00:58:42,514
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's something to look forward to.

903
00:58:42,834 --> 00:58:44,976
[SPEAKER_05]: We are going to be giving away some door prizes.

904
00:58:44,996 --> 00:58:46,777
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know how many, but we're going to be giving away some.

905
00:58:46,817 --> 00:58:47,878
[SPEAKER_05]: So stop by our table.

906
00:58:48,178 --> 00:58:49,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we'll do like a random drawing or something.

907
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, come get interviewed on the show and get a ticket in the drawing.

908
00:58:53,803 --> 00:58:54,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we'll do something like that.

909
00:58:54,744 --> 00:58:55,224
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be fun.

910
00:58:55,884 --> 00:58:58,567
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, so definitely look for us.

911
00:58:58,607 --> 00:59:00,808
[SPEAKER_05]: But except it can't just be come be interviewed on the show.

912
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:03,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, we have to interview them and ask them really humiliating questions.

913
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,803
[SPEAKER_13]: I just remembered that one question on the sex quiz.

914
00:59:07,843 --> 00:59:10,726
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll ask Travis if maybe we can borrow the sex quiz, if he wouldn't mind.

915
00:59:10,746 --> 00:59:13,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Shrimping.

916
00:59:14,689 --> 00:59:15,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Rusty trombone.

917
00:59:16,631 --> 00:59:18,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Take the sex quiz, win a DVD, maybe?

918
00:59:19,314 --> 00:59:19,754
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe.

919
00:59:23,278 --> 00:59:24,939
[SPEAKER_13]: Take the sex quiz, get spanked by Rob.

920
00:59:26,901 --> 00:59:27,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Bring a paddle.

921
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:31,313
[SPEAKER_13]: with the heart on the little saddle.

922
00:59:32,454 --> 00:59:35,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Since we'll be in Frisco, you know, a date with Rob in the Castro.

923
00:59:35,615 --> 00:59:36,836
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be a prize.

924
00:59:37,436 --> 00:59:38,117
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate the Castro.

925
00:59:38,797 --> 00:59:41,498
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like one or two good stores there, but the rest of it is dirty.

926
00:59:41,558 --> 00:59:42,439
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a dirty place.

927
00:59:42,819 --> 00:59:43,299
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is.

928
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:43,900
[SPEAKER_05]: Dirty!

929
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:44,920
[SPEAKER_05]: It's dirty.

930
00:59:46,061 --> 00:59:46,161
[SPEAKER_13]: Ew.

931
00:59:46,801 --> 00:59:46,941
[SPEAKER_13]: Ew.

932
00:59:47,401 --> 00:59:48,902
[SPEAKER_13]: Why is Jack's head green?

933
00:59:50,423 --> 00:59:50,923
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't get it.

934
00:59:51,363 --> 00:59:53,985
[SPEAKER_13]: Ew.

935
00:59:54,085 --> 00:59:56,546
[SPEAKER_13]: That looks like a big bottle of snot with a hat on it.

936
00:59:58,342 --> 00:59:59,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Puppy had a great idea.

937
00:59:59,242 --> 01:00:01,243
[SPEAKER_05]: We can get Violent Hypergirl to bring her whip again.

938
01:00:01,584 --> 01:00:01,824
Ooh!

939
01:00:02,764 --> 01:00:05,165
[SPEAKER_13]: We can see if we can borrow one out of the... What the hell?

940
01:00:05,245 --> 01:00:06,066
[SPEAKER_13]: ...cast supply.

941
01:00:06,486 --> 01:00:11,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Creative Labs has every single version of the Sound Blaster listed on their site, except the one I have.

942
01:00:13,529 --> 01:00:14,530
[SPEAKER_07]: What is up with that?

943
01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:19,512
[SPEAKER_07]: They have the basic Sound Blaster Live, and then mine is Sound Blaster Live 5.1, okay?

944
01:00:19,772 --> 01:00:27,016
[SPEAKER_07]: They have Sound Blaster Live 5.1 MP3+, and Sound Blaster Live 5.1 Gamer, but no Sound Blaster... Go to Download.com.

945
01:00:29,955 --> 01:00:33,177
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to put my old sound card in because this one sucks ass.

946
01:00:33,477 --> 01:00:37,179
[SPEAKER_07]: My old card never gave me problems and my old motherboard never gave me problems too.

947
01:00:37,719 --> 01:00:38,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking fries.

948
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:43,101
[SPEAKER_05]: The chat room is suggesting that I cosplay Mr. Spanky for B3.

949
01:00:43,722 --> 01:00:51,425
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what's scary is I have seen that exact thing that Mr. Spanky wears in a leather store in San Francisco on Folsom Street.

950
01:00:52,606 --> 01:00:53,426
[SPEAKER_05]: So I could go buy it.

951
01:00:55,489 --> 01:00:56,390
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll do an exhibition.

952
01:01:20,370 --> 01:01:21,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Exhibitionism.

953
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:22,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Dick does an Exhibitionism.

954
01:01:23,371 --> 01:01:24,551
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an exciting idea.

955
01:01:28,592 --> 01:01:34,514
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have to find some big fur coat and some shiny shirts and things like that.

956
01:01:35,014 --> 01:01:37,335
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to go shopping at some gay stores this week and see what I can find.

957
01:01:39,575 --> 01:01:41,176
[SPEAKER_05]: I should buy my costume at Naughty and Nice.

958
01:01:45,817 --> 01:01:47,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Dick in Mantis.

959
01:01:47,598 --> 01:01:48,938
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll get you a school uniform.

960
01:01:49,878 --> 01:01:50,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Dead End Dead End

961
01:02:18,795 --> 01:02:20,056
[SPEAKER_05]: We could do it to something like 511.

962
01:02:21,498 --> 01:02:22,299
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be funny.

963
01:02:22,339 --> 01:02:24,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Too bad Flourish for Albion isn't in there.

964
01:02:24,682 --> 01:02:24,942
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

965
01:02:25,202 --> 01:02:25,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Cry.

966
01:02:29,146 --> 01:02:30,388
[SPEAKER_13]: I've got my addiction back.

967
01:02:31,629 --> 01:02:31,829
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

968
01:02:31,989 --> 01:02:33,451
[SPEAKER_13]: Ragnarok Online is free once more.

969
01:02:33,892 --> 01:02:34,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it?

970
01:02:35,535 --> 01:02:38,357
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I see Justin in our chat room has been playing that a lot too.

971
01:02:38,538 --> 01:02:39,839
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, he's in my party.

972
01:02:40,279 --> 01:02:40,639
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, cool.

973
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:47,065
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been helping him gain levels because I am so happy because I have a plus five stiletto now.

974
01:02:47,965 --> 01:02:48,966
[SPEAKER_05]: And that means in English?

975
01:02:49,126 --> 01:02:51,708
[SPEAKER_13]: That means I can kill things faster and have them kill me less.

976
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:54,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

977
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:58,974
[SPEAKER_13]: If there was this one critter, it would take me a whole life bar to kill and now I can kill five of them.

978
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:00,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nice.

979
01:03:00,816 --> 01:03:01,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

980
01:03:02,317 --> 01:03:02,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a nerd.

981
01:03:04,512 --> 01:03:05,953
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on.

982
01:03:26,363 --> 01:03:31,833
[SPEAKER_05]: So we thought we'd talk to you, we thought Loki and I would talk to you about what we've seen on G4, what's cool and what sucks.

983
01:03:32,253 --> 01:03:36,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, what's cool, first off, best show on all of G4, Starrcade.

984
01:03:37,302 --> 01:03:38,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Starrcade rocks.

985
01:03:39,225 --> 01:03:46,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Old School Game Show from 83, where they play video games like Pac-Man and Pango and Pole Position, and they win video games.

986
01:03:47,028 --> 01:03:47,969
[SPEAKER_05]: They win arcade machines.

987
01:03:48,029 --> 01:03:49,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Hands down the best show on G4.

988
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:52,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, now what sucks about G4, Loki?

989
01:03:53,291 --> 01:03:55,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually, there's one more good show on there.

990
01:03:56,152 --> 01:04:02,014
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Electric Play or something like that.

991
01:04:02,094 --> 01:04:03,895
[SPEAKER_07]: It's where they review only action games.

992
01:04:03,955 --> 01:04:04,616
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty cool.

993
01:04:05,016 --> 01:04:07,757
[SPEAKER_07]: They do these little skit things that are kind of funny.

994
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:08,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

995
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:10,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are mildly entertaining.

996
01:04:11,298 --> 01:04:18,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, what really sucks, this one show, Portal, is the gayest show I've ever seen.

997
01:04:18,781 --> 01:04:22,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, this guy that looks like... Wait a minute, gayer than queerest folk?

998
01:04:23,208 --> 01:04:24,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it's pretty bad.

999
01:04:24,909 --> 01:04:32,772
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, okay, this guy is like, I would say he's pretty much like the gamer version of Blue's Clues.

1000
01:04:33,252 --> 01:04:41,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, this guy is just sitting there talking to nobody, except for this imaginary computer thing that's supposedly in the studio that talks to him about...

1001
01:04:42,356 --> 01:05:07,282
[SPEAKER_07]: really stupid things and they're making it sound all high-tech and cool and all he does is he talks about different like cities and towns and stuff they're in online games then they do this stupid little like skit where they have these people walking around or whatever in like online games and they're like making them talk you know dubbing over their voices and doing little stories it's really retarded it is just dumb it's damn awful

1002
01:05:09,344 --> 01:05:10,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that game sucks.

1003
01:05:10,166 --> 01:05:10,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Dumbass.

1004
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:22,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Nick Arcade

1005
01:05:39,983 --> 01:05:50,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and also what really sucks is they've got these stupid commercials where they show the Twin Galaxies world records for like these two games.

1006
01:05:51,495 --> 01:05:51,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Two games.

1007
01:05:51,915 --> 01:05:57,200
[SPEAKER_05]: They have like, that's old school Orange Lounge topics right there talking about Twin Galaxies and their old DDR...

1008
01:05:57,941 --> 01:05:58,581
[SPEAKER_07]: What was number one?

1009
01:05:58,621 --> 01:05:59,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Legend of Zelda

1010
01:06:17,483 --> 01:06:18,364
[SPEAKER_07]: I forget what number two was.

1011
01:06:18,444 --> 01:06:19,345
[SPEAKER_07]: It was another series.

1012
01:06:19,365 --> 01:06:20,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Guardian Legend was better.

1013
01:06:20,445 --> 01:06:21,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Another series.

1014
01:06:21,186 --> 01:06:22,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Guardian Legend wasn't on the list.

1015
01:06:23,327 --> 01:06:24,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Those bastards.

1016
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:25,548
[SPEAKER_05]: At all.

1017
01:06:26,008 --> 01:06:26,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Was E.T.

1018
01:06:26,669 --> 01:06:26,929
[SPEAKER_05]: on there?

1019
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:28,210
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1020
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:31,211
[SPEAKER_05]: What about Custer's Revenge?

1021
01:06:31,972 --> 01:06:32,192
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1022
01:06:33,213 --> 01:06:34,153
[SPEAKER_07]: No, what else?

1023
01:06:35,034 --> 01:06:37,795
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a few that were really stupid that beat up other ones.

1024
01:06:39,356 --> 01:06:41,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Grand Theft Auto was under...

1025
01:06:43,587 --> 01:06:44,107
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember.

1026
01:06:44,127 --> 01:06:46,368
[SPEAKER_07]: There's just a lot of really dumb games on the list.

1027
01:06:46,388 --> 01:06:48,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I could find that list online somewhere.

1028
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:50,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's on G4.

1029
01:06:50,971 --> 01:06:51,751
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll see if I can find it.

1030
01:06:52,231 --> 01:06:54,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep talking about G4 while I look for this list.

1031
01:06:54,292 --> 01:07:03,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Then they have these stupid intimate moments with Lara Croft where there's this guy talking to her and it's just really retarded.

1032
01:07:03,557 --> 01:07:08,499
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this guy is talking to this chick that's supposedly next to him and he's not making a play at all.

1033
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:09,720
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, what a loser.

1034
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:10,701
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be some...

1035
01:07:11,621 --> 01:07:27,933
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, intimate moments, I wanna see some intimate moments, I wanna see this, hi, don't you hate it that people think that, you know, you're unintelligent and stuff, da da da da da, he should be like, bitch, get down on my lap, you know, stuff like that, cause I mean, I don't know, it's just really awful.

1036
01:07:28,653 --> 01:07:41,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Really awful TV, and then they have these stupid screenshots they do of different games and stuff, and that was awful, and it's programmed cheats, it gives you codes for games that are way old, and it's just a lot of waste of TV.

1037
01:07:42,918 --> 01:07:50,861
[SPEAKER_06]: No, one thing I think is pretty good is that Judgment Day one, because I like the one dude who's just got a total jackass attitude towards every game, even if it's good, he's like a total prick about it.

1038
01:07:51,461 --> 01:08:20,320
[SPEAKER_06]: and that other guy said to their well no actually I thought it was a pretty good game is all no this game is the crap and just starts going off on them without cussing them out it's pretty good you know I can't find a list of that top 100 games of all time but that whole thing is on tonight and it starts at 9.30 with part 1 see then you gotta watch it no if you if you just watch the last episode they basically cover everything that was on there so just watch the last episode screw the rest filter's pretty good too

1039
01:08:23,044 --> 01:08:28,906
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we've talked about G4, we talked about B3, and we talked about E3, so that's everything we said we'd talk about, yes?

1040
01:08:29,847 --> 01:08:32,548
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all the letter number combinations that we need.

1041
01:08:33,188 --> 01:08:33,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1042
01:08:34,548 --> 01:08:35,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you about to fall asleep, Jamie?

1043
01:08:37,745 --> 01:08:38,786
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to do fuck you's of the week.

1044
01:08:38,966 --> 01:08:41,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to do the cage match now or do you want to do fuck you's now?

1045
01:08:42,307 --> 01:08:42,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

1046
01:08:43,188 --> 01:08:45,329
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to do fuck... Excuse you!

1047
01:08:45,349 --> 01:08:46,169
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just kidding.

1048
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:49,111
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll take a quick break and we'll come back and do the fuck you's of the week.

1049
01:08:49,511 --> 01:08:51,992
[SPEAKER_05]: So why don't you go ahead and send those to me in the chat room.

1050
01:08:52,052 --> 01:08:53,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, I'm Sky.

1051
01:08:53,073 --> 01:08:54,374
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sitting in the chat room right now.

1052
01:08:55,014 --> 01:08:55,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

1053
01:08:56,275 --> 01:08:56,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Play Angry Thing.

1054
01:08:56,795 --> 01:09:00,817
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to play some... I'm going to play... Wait.

1055
01:09:01,177 --> 01:09:02,698
[SPEAKER_05]: There's quite a difference between those.

1056
01:09:04,059 --> 01:09:05,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie says play show tunes.

1057
01:09:05,419 --> 01:09:06,580
[SPEAKER_05]: What songs are show tune-ish?

1058
01:09:09,753 --> 01:09:11,914
[SPEAKER_05]: My god, I don't know what songs those are.

1059
01:09:11,954 --> 01:09:12,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I play angry songs?

1060
01:09:12,894 --> 01:09:13,854
[SPEAKER_05]: I can find those easier.

1061
01:09:14,915 --> 01:09:17,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I have to... Play all tack?

1062
01:09:19,016 --> 01:09:20,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we'll take a tack break.

1063
01:09:23,037 --> 01:09:24,097
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll take a tic-tac break.

1064
01:09:26,538 --> 01:09:27,558
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll be back.

1065
01:09:28,779 --> 01:09:29,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we will.

1066
01:09:29,639 --> 01:09:31,199
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to find some tack stuff first.

1067
01:09:31,219 --> 01:09:31,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

1068
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:33,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yes.

1069
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:36,041
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to play some tack, and then we'll be back.

1070
01:09:36,101 --> 01:09:37,361
[SPEAKER_05]: So send those FUs to me.

1071
01:09:37,761 --> 01:09:38,062
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Skye.

1072
01:09:39,862 --> 01:09:40,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Tag and bet.

1073
01:09:41,003 --> 01:09:42,383
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in the chat room as Sky.

1074
01:09:43,204 --> 01:09:45,965
[SPEAKER_05]: If you aren't in our chat room, you should be.

1075
01:09:46,285 --> 01:09:47,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Get your ass over there.

1076
01:09:47,346 --> 01:09:54,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Go over to www.calibermani.com, click on Orange Lounge, and then click on Chat.

1077
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:58,112
[SPEAKER_05]: And while you're at calibermani.com, visit our forums.

1078
01:09:58,292 --> 01:09:58,592
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1079
01:09:58,672 --> 01:09:59,552
[SPEAKER_13]: You said chat.

1080
01:09:59,752 --> 01:10:00,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I did.

1081
01:10:02,754 --> 01:10:04,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we have a little clip of the AMIX one more time?

1082
01:10:04,895 --> 01:10:05,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, just a little clip.

1083
01:10:05,896 --> 01:10:06,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a little bit.

1084
01:10:11,909 --> 01:10:12,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.

1085
01:10:13,170 --> 01:10:13,371
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1086
01:10:14,392 --> 01:10:14,752
[SPEAKER_05]: New one?

1087
01:10:19,237 --> 01:10:20,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay, you're lame.

1088
01:10:21,259 --> 01:10:23,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we'll be back after this quick break.

1089
01:10:23,441 --> 01:10:25,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Send me your FUs of the week and we'll read those.

1090
01:10:26,644 --> 01:10:28,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, we forgot to talk about Pump It Up.

1091
01:10:28,326 --> 01:10:29,487
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we'll do that later too.

1092
01:10:29,808 --> 01:10:30,889
[SPEAKER_13]: Pump It Up is Korean.

1093
01:10:32,472 --> 01:10:32,812
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back.

1094
01:10:32,832 --> 01:10:33,913
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll talk about Pompadour a little later.

1095
01:10:35,854 --> 01:10:37,835
[SPEAKER_05]: We're teasing it so that you have to keep listening.

1096
01:10:38,615 --> 01:10:40,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Quit playing crap so I can play the break music.

1097
01:10:41,976 --> 01:10:42,737
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll be back.

1098
01:10:44,458 --> 01:10:45,638
[SPEAKER_09]: What the fuck is this?

1099
01:10:47,259 --> 01:10:47,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, what's this?

1100
01:10:48,839 --> 01:10:49,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Stoic.

1101
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:49,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

1102
01:12:23,908 --> 01:12:30,481
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

1103
01:12:54,302 --> 01:12:55,733
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks for watching!

1104
01:13:39,847 --> 01:13:41,011
Thank you for watching!

1105
01:16:07,273 --> 01:16:11,337
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

1106
01:16:11,597 --> 01:16:12,157
[SPEAKER_21]: Extreme Bobani Radio.

1107
01:16:12,177 --> 01:16:12,498
[SPEAKER_21]: That's us.

1108
01:16:12,518 --> 01:16:13,318
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1109
01:16:35,086 --> 01:16:36,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, we are back now.

1110
01:16:36,266 --> 01:16:37,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoops, sorry about that.

1111
01:16:38,287 --> 01:16:39,768
[SPEAKER_05]: We're having some technical difficulties there.

1112
01:16:40,128 --> 01:16:42,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki and I are trying to share our computers here, and it's fucking things up.

1113
01:16:44,489 --> 01:16:45,010
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're back.

1114
01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:47,551
Yay!

1115
01:16:47,891 --> 01:16:48,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

1116
01:16:49,751 --> 01:16:51,052
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so excited that we're back.

1117
01:16:51,352 --> 01:16:53,433
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it.

1118
01:16:54,473 --> 01:16:54,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

1119
01:16:56,454 --> 01:16:59,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, let's talk about Pump It Up, because Sharon wanted us to talk about Pump It Up.

1120
01:16:59,375 --> 01:16:59,655
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Korean.

1121
01:16:59,675 --> 01:17:00,775
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't in a while.

1122
01:17:01,016 --> 01:17:01,536
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Korean.

1123
01:17:01,556 --> 01:17:01,956
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?

1124
01:17:01,996 --> 01:17:02,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you like it?

1125
01:17:02,416 --> 01:17:02,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you hate it?

1126
01:17:03,556 --> 01:17:04,737
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it, but it's Korean.

1127
01:17:05,450 --> 01:17:05,990
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that mean?

1128
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:07,011
[SPEAKER_13]: It's Korean.

1129
01:17:08,191 --> 01:17:08,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1130
01:17:08,631 --> 01:17:10,912
[SPEAKER_13]: I hated the version that was at New York, New York.

1131
01:17:11,352 --> 01:17:12,132
[SPEAKER_13]: It was in Vegas.

1132
01:17:12,172 --> 01:17:12,672
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god.

1133
01:17:13,513 --> 01:17:16,254
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, first of all, the stage was so messed up.

1134
01:17:17,554 --> 01:17:21,295
[SPEAKER_13]: It kept going past the song I wanted because every time you stepped on it, it would hit two.

1135
01:17:21,515 --> 01:17:23,056
[SPEAKER_13]: And there were like a bajillion songs in the game.

1136
01:17:23,076 --> 01:17:24,596
[SPEAKER_13]: It was like one of the last ones out.

1137
01:17:25,437 --> 01:17:27,757
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I couldn't find the songs I wanted.

1138
01:17:27,797 --> 01:17:29,178
[SPEAKER_13]: It took me forever to find Run To You.

1139
01:17:30,058 --> 01:17:32,319
[SPEAKER_13]: and then it would automatically put you into another difficulty.

1140
01:17:32,379 --> 01:17:32,859
[SPEAKER_13]: It sucked.

1141
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:34,400
[SPEAKER_13]: But I mean, I like Pump It Up, though.

1142
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,120
[SPEAKER_13]: I hate playing Caution on Pump It Up, though.

1143
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:39,281
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it's so slow.

1144
01:17:40,702 --> 01:17:44,443
[SPEAKER_05]: My thoughts on Pump It Up, I absolutely hated the game when I first played it, and I'll tell you why.

1145
01:17:45,303 --> 01:17:46,864
[SPEAKER_05]: The interface sucks.

1146
01:17:47,504 --> 01:18:03,818
[SPEAKER_05]: on all versions because they don't you have to use your feet to move around it's too slow I mean I like on DDR you can really fastly throw through the songs even on fourth mix you can move through the songs a hell of a lot faster than you can and pump it up and that just pisses me off I shouldn't have to stand there for five minutes trying to select my song I know you can

1147
01:18:04,935 --> 01:18:05,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, so whatever.

1148
01:18:05,936 --> 01:18:08,017
[SPEAKER_05]: But other than that, it's alright.

1149
01:18:08,077 --> 01:18:09,798
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the videos in the back are pretty cool.

1150
01:18:09,818 --> 01:18:11,378
[SPEAKER_13]: The one to take on me was the best.

1151
01:18:11,839 --> 01:18:13,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the songs are pretty cool.

1152
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:16,281
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like some of the songs in Pump It Up.

1153
01:18:16,301 --> 01:18:17,102
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the big screen.

1154
01:18:17,382 --> 01:18:23,125
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it takes a lot of crap, but its really horrible interface hurts it a lot more than it really should.

1155
01:18:23,545 --> 01:18:27,427
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of people are just turned off by the... it's just not easy to use.

1156
01:18:29,028 --> 01:18:30,909
[SPEAKER_13]: Imagine if we had DVR on a big screen like that.

1157
01:18:35,228 --> 01:18:35,829
[SPEAKER_13]: It'd be pretty.

1158
01:18:38,372 --> 01:18:38,892
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it doesn't.

1159
01:18:40,494 --> 01:18:41,515
[SPEAKER_13]: Pump It Up does not suck.

1160
01:18:41,956 --> 01:18:43,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do you think Pump It Up sucks, Zero?

1161
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:46,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Well...

1162
01:18:48,328 --> 01:18:52,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, one reason why I think it absolutely sucks is the interface does suck.

1163
01:18:54,210 --> 01:18:58,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I can play this, I can play the game, and there's a couple good songs that I like.

1164
01:18:58,831 --> 01:19:04,953
[SPEAKER_06]: When half the other songs are trash, the damn thing takes forever to load after a song.

1165
01:19:04,993 --> 01:19:10,375
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta stand there for 45 seconds just to take 30 seconds to pick a song.

1166
01:19:11,315 --> 01:19:16,118
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really like playing diagonal instead of up and down, left and right.

1167
01:19:16,138 --> 01:19:16,658
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what, though?

1168
01:19:16,678 --> 01:19:20,640
[SPEAKER_05]: The diagonal thing, for some reason, it makes freestyling a lot more natural.

1169
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:22,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it makes you freestyle.

1170
01:19:22,081 --> 01:19:23,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I think that's kind of cool.

1171
01:19:23,342 --> 01:19:24,802
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one thing I like about Pump It Up.

1172
01:19:25,203 --> 01:19:26,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that's the point.

1173
01:19:27,044 --> 01:19:37,069
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think DDR could actually use maybe some type of the style of the videos that are in Pump It Up on some.

1174
01:19:37,589 --> 01:19:40,271
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's some that are horrible, but I think that there's a lot of...

1175
01:19:41,071 --> 01:19:42,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Ideas DDR can take from Pump?

1176
01:19:43,173 --> 01:19:45,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Same thing would Pump could take from DDR.

1177
01:19:45,935 --> 01:19:56,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, yeah, having just an easier interface, being able to choose your songs quicker, and possibly changing their hardware so that you don't have to stand around for a month.

1178
01:19:56,383 --> 01:19:58,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't a Pump It Up machine just a big computer inside that box?

1179
01:19:59,166 --> 01:19:59,846
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I heard.

1180
01:19:59,946 --> 01:20:00,947
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a big PC in there.

1181
01:20:01,267 --> 01:20:03,549
[SPEAKER_06]: They could have changed that if they really wanted to.

1182
01:20:03,930 --> 01:20:05,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Would have been a little bit easier for everyone else.

1183
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:08,382
[SPEAKER_13]: I've played a game that's worse, though.

1184
01:20:09,324 --> 01:20:09,624
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

1185
01:20:09,685 --> 01:20:10,586
[SPEAKER_13]: God, I can't remember the name of it.

1186
01:20:10,607 --> 01:20:11,388
[SPEAKER_13]: It was put out by Jaleco.

1187
01:20:12,313 --> 01:20:12,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Technomotion?

1188
01:20:13,133 --> 01:20:13,854
[SPEAKER_13]: Not Technomotion.

1189
01:20:14,234 --> 01:20:17,876
[SPEAKER_13]: No, what it is, they have one at this bowling alley I went to in Hayward.

1190
01:20:18,716 --> 01:20:21,637
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's got three monitors.

1191
01:20:21,998 --> 01:20:25,539
[SPEAKER_13]: The middle monitor is the videos, and it looks like one of those make-your-own-video things.

1192
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:26,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh.

1193
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:29,241
[SPEAKER_13]: Where people are doing really crappy dances and wearing really crappy clothes.

1194
01:20:29,321 --> 01:20:34,664
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's got, like, you know how Samba de Amigo, how your maraca places are set up?

1195
01:20:35,104 --> 01:20:36,384
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's like that on the floor.

1196
01:20:37,005 --> 01:20:39,606
[SPEAKER_13]: And you do your steps like that, and there are different colors that tells you where to go.

1197
01:20:41,713 --> 01:20:42,975
[SPEAKER_13]: God, what's that game called?

1198
01:20:43,475 --> 01:20:45,818
[SPEAKER_13]: It's by Jaleco.

1199
01:20:47,139 --> 01:20:47,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Do a search.

1200
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:48,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Weird.

1201
01:20:49,081 --> 01:20:49,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Do a search real quick.

1202
01:20:50,363 --> 01:20:52,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on just a sec because I'm queuing up some other stuff for later in the show.

1203
01:20:55,668 --> 01:20:56,930
[SPEAKER_13]: I missed playing Technomotion.

1204
01:20:57,190 --> 01:20:58,251
[SPEAKER_13]: They have one at Excalibur.

1205
01:20:58,571 --> 01:20:59,272
[SPEAKER_13]: I missed playing it.

1206
01:21:02,252 --> 01:21:04,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for bringing that up, Loki.

1207
01:21:05,714 --> 01:21:11,338
[SPEAKER_05]: What's cooler than Pump It Up is the game that the same company made called Dance Station 3DDX.

1208
01:21:11,438 --> 01:21:12,018
[SPEAKER_11]: And Amiro?

1209
01:21:12,559 --> 01:21:14,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and Amiro.

1210
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:19,583
[SPEAKER_05]: The way it looks is so cool because instead of the arrows that are set in...

1211
01:21:20,922 --> 01:21:23,724
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how the buttons are kind of sunk into the pad a little bit?

1212
01:21:24,044 --> 01:21:34,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the way 3DDX is, and the same thing with Easy To Dancer, is it's a big black panel that's over the whole thing, and then different areas of it light up, so it's a big flat panel.

1213
01:21:34,891 --> 01:21:38,653
[SPEAKER_05]: So it kind of makes finding the buttons a little harder, but it kind of adds to the challenge of the game.

1214
01:21:39,153 --> 01:21:44,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in 3DDX, not only that, but there's para-like sensors all around the sides, so you have to wave your arms, too, to play.

1215
01:21:45,077 --> 01:21:45,597
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome.

1216
01:21:46,438 --> 01:21:48,519
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has such songs as Jenny in a Bottle...

1217
01:21:51,038 --> 01:21:52,638
[SPEAKER_07]: That game makes you freestyle.

1218
01:21:52,859 --> 01:21:54,159
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta adjust the volume on this one.

1219
01:21:54,439 --> 01:21:56,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that game makes you freestyle.

1220
01:21:56,660 --> 01:21:57,660
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't talk very loud.

1221
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:01,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Here, look, if you want to... You can use this one, Loki.

1222
01:22:03,281 --> 01:22:04,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't change it too much.

1223
01:22:06,202 --> 01:22:07,222
[SPEAKER_05]: What was I looking for?

1224
01:22:07,482 --> 01:22:07,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Shoot.

1225
01:22:08,163 --> 01:22:09,323
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, they're number one in Italy.

1226
01:22:13,924 --> 01:22:16,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so are we about ready for the FUs of the week?

1227
01:22:16,505 --> 01:22:16,765
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

1228
01:22:17,525 --> 01:22:17,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?

1229
01:22:18,045 --> 01:22:18,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.

1230
01:22:19,466 --> 01:22:20,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, you know what to do.

1231
01:22:36,351 --> 01:22:38,493
[SPEAKER_13]: My first one, my first F.U.

1232
01:22:38,513 --> 01:22:42,617
[SPEAKER_13]: of the week goes to being tired and not sleeping.

1233
01:22:44,038 --> 01:22:49,583
[SPEAKER_13]: My other one goes toward my poor, poor body for being sore after Rocky last night.

1234
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:54,267
[SPEAKER_13]: And, I don't know, I'm not really all that angsty.

1235
01:22:55,468 --> 01:22:55,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Gasp.

1236
01:22:57,189 --> 01:23:02,694
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, there's the usual, like, the idiot drivers and driving here to do the show.

1237
01:23:04,072 --> 01:23:07,476
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm driving to South Sac and went up here.

1238
01:23:07,797 --> 01:23:08,657
[SPEAKER_13]: Love you, Jamie.

1239
01:23:08,978 --> 01:23:10,099
[SPEAKER_13]: He got me food, so he's forgiven.

1240
01:23:11,681 --> 01:23:15,205
[SPEAKER_13]: I was teasing anyway.

1241
01:23:15,605 --> 01:23:22,593
[SPEAKER_13]: One of them goes to, well, I love my fiance a whole lot, but he ate a whole box of live cereal and I didn't get any.

1242
01:23:24,170 --> 01:23:25,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it Cinnamon Life?

1243
01:23:25,230 --> 01:23:26,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Cinnamon Life is the best.

1244
01:23:26,471 --> 01:23:27,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Cinnamon Life sucks.

1245
01:23:27,591 --> 01:23:28,231
[SPEAKER_05]: It's normal.

1246
01:23:28,351 --> 01:23:30,952
[SPEAKER_05]: If he ate the whole box of Cinnamon Life, that is a crime.

1247
01:23:30,972 --> 01:23:31,212
[SPEAKER_13]: That's okay.

1248
01:23:31,252 --> 01:23:32,292
[SPEAKER_13]: I found another box, though.

1249
01:23:32,612 --> 01:23:33,873
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I bought the other two for five.

1250
01:23:34,193 --> 01:23:34,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Cinnamon Life is the best.

1251
01:23:35,013 --> 01:23:35,893
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate Cinnamon Life.

1252
01:23:35,913 --> 01:23:36,834
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate Cinnamon Life.

1253
01:23:36,854 --> 01:23:38,614
[SPEAKER_13]: What is wrong with you?

1254
01:23:38,634 --> 01:23:39,034
[SPEAKER_13]: Normal.

1255
01:23:39,554 --> 01:23:40,075
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1256
01:23:40,235 --> 01:23:41,995
[SPEAKER_13]: Cinnamon Life tastes like shit.

1257
01:23:43,376 --> 01:23:44,136
[SPEAKER_13]: I like the normal one.

1258
01:23:44,616 --> 01:23:46,897
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't like oddly flavored cereals.

1259
01:23:47,017 --> 01:23:48,677
[SPEAKER_13]: I like Cracklin' Oat Bran.

1260
01:23:48,697 --> 01:23:49,097
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll put it that way.

1261
01:23:49,117 --> 01:23:49,837
[SPEAKER_13]: I like Grape Nuts.

1262
01:23:50,718 --> 01:23:51,338
[SPEAKER_13]: I like Total.

1263
01:23:52,742 --> 01:23:54,464
[SPEAKER_13]: When I was a little kid, I ate adult cereals.

1264
01:23:54,584 --> 01:23:55,585
[SPEAKER_13]: And I hate marshmallows.

1265
01:23:56,106 --> 01:23:57,287
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck marshmallows, okay?

1266
01:23:57,327 --> 01:23:58,028
[SPEAKER_13]: Because they're nasty.

1267
01:23:59,109 --> 01:24:02,672
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um... I guess that's it.

1268
01:24:03,413 --> 01:24:03,814
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1269
01:24:03,954 --> 01:24:04,534
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm tired.

1270
01:24:04,554 --> 01:24:05,355
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck being tired.

1271
01:24:06,456 --> 01:24:06,797
[SPEAKER_13]: Blech.

1272
01:24:08,399 --> 01:24:08,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Next.

1273
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:12,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on to Loki, although I'm very scared because he made a list.

1274
01:24:18,253 --> 01:24:18,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

1275
01:24:19,794 --> 01:24:21,055
[SPEAKER_07]: I still think this thing is too loud.

1276
01:24:21,075 --> 01:24:25,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, um... I know.

1277
01:24:25,919 --> 01:24:26,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1278
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:36,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, see, first FU is gonna go to my sound card, because while it being new, it skips when I play stuff, as you heard earlier with that exclusive remix.

1279
01:24:37,310 --> 01:24:37,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1280
01:24:38,854 --> 01:24:39,915
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what's wrong with it.

1281
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:50,780
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pissing me off because I'm looking on their site to find drivers and they don't have any drivers for this car because the car doesn't exist according to their site, which is also really annoying.

1282
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,561
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have to find drivers for this somewhere.

1283
01:24:53,581 --> 01:24:55,242
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking that's probably what the problem is for it.

1284
01:24:55,782 --> 01:24:57,363
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have you in my sound card because it sucks.

1285
01:24:58,163 --> 01:25:04,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, since we're on the subject of that, I have you in my motherboard because, you know, I got this nice motherboard and processor combo.

1286
01:25:04,667 --> 01:25:05,968
[SPEAKER_07]: It's supposed to be an AMD 2200.

1287
01:25:06,068 --> 01:25:10,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's supposed to be, you know, running about, you know, 2 gigahertz or whatever.

1288
01:25:10,070 --> 01:25:11,191
[SPEAKER_07]: It's running at 135.

1289
01:25:13,072 --> 01:25:15,073
[SPEAKER_07]: My old processor was faster than that.

1290
01:25:15,413 --> 01:25:20,416
[SPEAKER_07]: So I basically paid $300, or no, $150 for a downgrade.

1291
01:25:22,177 --> 01:25:22,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Fries.

1292
01:25:23,197 --> 01:25:24,058
[SPEAKER_07]: You can suck ass.

1293
01:25:26,195 --> 01:25:29,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here, let's also talk about old people.

1294
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:33,684
[SPEAKER_07]: I had an encounter with this really old bag that was

1295
01:25:35,362 --> 01:25:56,079
[SPEAKER_07]: at the, at release, and I was just waiting in line to get some, you know, Chinese food, and she's pushing her car, oh, I'm, oh, cutting right in front of us, and then stupid Chinese lady, what's happened, she freaking, you know, goes, and talks, what do you want, what do you want, what do you want,

1296
01:26:00,053 --> 01:26:20,151
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, I'm sitting here going, yeah, I guess we don't need lines, and this stupid bitch in front of me started saying, well, and I just totally tuned her out then, and I was just like, okay, not talking to you because you're ugly, and then, um,

1297
01:26:20,911 --> 01:26:29,320
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, F you this stupid old bitch because she didn't even know what she wanted and here I'm just waiting here going, come on, come on, come on, come on, move, move, move, move, come on, come on, come on, you're old, come on, move.

1298
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:34,044
[SPEAKER_07]: So, wasted like a good extra half an hour than I really needed.

1299
01:26:35,406 --> 01:26:40,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so now, um, also, and F you to, um, stupid drivers.

1300
01:26:41,801 --> 01:26:50,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Goddammit, there's this road down here and everyone backs up because they want no turn, because they backs up a good, like, you know, half a mile, so people want a turn.

1301
01:26:51,089 --> 01:26:54,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, these stupid people don't really, oh, I have to get in that lane to turn?

1302
01:26:54,191 --> 01:26:56,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that why all the people are there?

1303
01:26:56,373 --> 01:27:00,896
[SPEAKER_07]: So they stop in the middle of your lane trying to turn over and won't move out of the way.

1304
01:27:01,937 --> 01:27:07,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I had another jackass when I went to McDonald's yesterday who was checking his food in the middle of the parking lot.

1305
01:27:08,308 --> 01:27:09,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Direct middle of the parking lot.

1306
01:27:09,309 --> 01:27:11,110
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't go around him because he was sitting in the way.

1307
01:27:11,150 --> 01:27:17,354
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was just kind of going, I just got my stupid hamburger.

1308
01:27:18,095 --> 01:27:19,676
[SPEAKER_07]: So, F you that.

1309
01:27:20,796 --> 01:27:23,638
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to the people on Ain't It Cool News for giving away the ending of The Matrix.

1310
01:27:23,658 --> 01:27:28,081
[SPEAKER_07]: They keep trying to read reviews on stuff, and they keep giving away the ending of The Matrix, and it's like sneaking up on me.

1311
01:27:28,121 --> 01:27:31,063
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep finding out more stuff I don't want to know about it, and it's really annoying.

1312
01:27:31,083 --> 01:27:37,868
[SPEAKER_07]: But I only have four more days until I get to go see the movie, which reminds me, my girlfriend doesn't really want to go, so I have an extra ticket if anyone wants to go with me.

1313
01:27:40,256 --> 01:27:40,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1314
01:27:41,537 --> 01:27:41,857
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

1315
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:47,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, uh, let's see here, and... It's at 545.

1316
01:27:47,881 --> 01:27:48,562
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only thing.

1317
01:27:48,582 --> 01:27:49,803
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to run over there.

1318
01:27:49,983 --> 01:27:50,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's cool.

1319
01:27:50,883 --> 01:27:51,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1320
01:27:51,604 --> 01:27:55,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and then, uh, F you to my website, cause it's gone.

1321
01:27:56,943 --> 01:27:57,783
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gone for good.

1322
01:27:58,064 --> 01:27:58,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye-bye.

1323
01:27:58,744 --> 01:27:59,244
[SPEAKER_07]: No site.

1324
01:27:59,524 --> 01:27:59,944
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gone.

1325
01:28:00,124 --> 01:28:04,406
[SPEAKER_07]: My hosting died, and I'm not gonna pay for hosting, and it saves me time that way.

1326
01:28:04,907 --> 01:28:06,307
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't have to work on my website anymore.

1327
01:28:06,827 --> 01:28:07,168
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gone.

1328
01:28:07,448 --> 01:28:07,808
[SPEAKER_07]: So what?

1329
01:28:08,008 --> 01:28:08,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and guess what?

1330
01:28:08,748 --> 01:28:14,451
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you can just find your stupid files anywhere else on the web, because I'm not responsible for doing your searching for you.

1331
01:28:14,911 --> 01:28:19,053
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't give a shit anymore, you know, because you don't do anything, you don't help me out, so, um...

1332
01:28:20,387 --> 01:28:21,428
[SPEAKER_07]: You can consider it bastard.

1333
01:28:21,448 --> 01:28:25,150
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go ahead and find your files on the web like I do and spend time like I do.

1334
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:26,371
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know what?

1335
01:28:26,431 --> 01:28:27,231
[SPEAKER_07]: It builds character.

1336
01:28:27,572 --> 01:28:29,072
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the hard work.

1337
01:28:29,092 --> 01:28:29,973
[SPEAKER_07]: It builds character.

1338
01:28:31,014 --> 01:28:31,514
[SPEAKER_07]: The hard work.

1339
01:28:31,554 --> 01:28:38,218
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want a huge sim collection like mine, you can go suck ass because you're never going to find it because most files are off the internet.

1340
01:28:38,498 --> 01:28:38,999
[SPEAKER_07]: So ha!

1341
01:28:39,339 --> 01:28:39,959
[SPEAKER_07]: I laugh at you.

1342
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:42,021
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a large collection and you do.

1343
01:28:42,041 --> 01:28:43,702
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a large collection and you do.

1344
01:28:43,722 --> 01:28:45,283
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

1345
01:28:46,604 --> 01:28:46,924
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um...

1346
01:28:50,669 --> 01:28:51,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I have Asian porn.

1347
01:28:51,470 --> 01:28:52,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's cool.

1348
01:28:52,231 --> 01:28:56,035
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um... Yeah, I think it's Asian porn because it's censored.

1349
01:28:56,276 --> 01:28:56,716
[SPEAKER_07]: That sucks.

1350
01:28:56,756 --> 01:28:59,179
[SPEAKER_07]: They have hot Asian chicks in there, like, all blocky.

1351
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:01,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks like a mosaic is attacking them.

1352
01:29:01,542 --> 01:29:02,083
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not cool.

1353
01:29:04,418 --> 01:29:08,980
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you have to say to those that say that the point of Leech from Loki is to, in fact, Leech from Loki?

1354
01:29:30,566 --> 01:29:37,139
[SPEAKER_07]: The point is that I left space for people to put files up so that people can leech from my site but no one put any files up.

1355
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:38,341
[SPEAKER_07]: And for that you must die.

1356
01:29:39,053 --> 01:29:39,693
[SPEAKER_07]: For that, you must die.

1357
01:29:40,034 --> 01:29:47,657
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know the whole purpose of the GIF files, but really all the files I had on there I got from DDRUK anyways, so go get them from them.

1358
01:29:48,178 --> 01:29:49,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit, this is like... What?

1359
01:29:50,519 --> 01:29:53,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, Bomani Sims at DDRUK is pretty much where I got all my files.

1360
01:29:53,961 --> 01:29:56,142
[SPEAKER_07]: There wasn't anything new on there yet.

1361
01:29:56,262 --> 01:29:58,683
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I was planning on it, I just never got around to it.

1362
01:29:59,203 --> 01:30:01,224
[SPEAKER_07]: So now I have more time to make cool files.

1363
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:05,346
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you should think of it as an advantage, because you get to see my files anyways.

1364
01:30:05,366 --> 01:30:06,267
[SPEAKER_07]: You have more time to remix.

1365
01:30:07,645 --> 01:30:10,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, yeah, if the sound card works.

1366
01:30:10,686 --> 01:30:11,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm done.

1367
01:30:11,786 --> 01:30:13,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, you're done.

1368
01:30:13,607 --> 01:30:14,027
[SPEAKER_05]: My turn.

1369
01:30:16,248 --> 01:30:16,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me think.

1370
01:30:16,988 --> 01:30:18,249
[SPEAKER_05]: What are some things I want to give an FU to?

1371
01:30:18,629 --> 01:30:25,031
[SPEAKER_05]: My first FU goes to my erratic sleeping schedule because I was a half hour late to work on Friday because I overslept.

1372
01:30:25,431 --> 01:30:25,991
[SPEAKER_05]: That sucks.

1373
01:30:26,331 --> 01:30:31,213
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's funny is that was the very last day of my old job because I just got a promotion at work so I started a new job tomorrow.

1374
01:30:31,673 --> 01:30:37,035
[SPEAKER_05]: But on Friday I was a half hour late and that really doesn't look good to show up a half hour late your last day.

1375
01:30:38,999 --> 01:30:39,319
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1376
01:30:39,459 --> 01:30:39,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops.

1377
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:42,222
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I slept 12 hours last night.

1378
01:30:42,262 --> 01:30:43,363
[SPEAKER_05]: That was exciting.

1379
01:30:43,923 --> 01:30:44,904
[SPEAKER_05]: So an F you to that.

1380
01:30:44,984 --> 01:30:45,925
[SPEAKER_05]: For me being lazy.

1381
01:30:47,446 --> 01:30:48,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I guess that's my F you.

1382
01:30:49,648 --> 01:30:50,789
[SPEAKER_05]: God, I'm such an asshole.

1383
01:30:51,810 --> 01:30:54,692
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to Loki, because he was a real dick in that last F you of the week.

1384
01:30:58,135 --> 01:30:58,635
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1385
01:30:59,016 --> 01:30:59,256
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1386
01:30:59,436 --> 01:31:00,897
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be less of a dick if...

1387
01:31:02,122 --> 01:31:02,242
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1388
01:31:02,562 --> 01:31:04,164
[SPEAKER_07]: If your roommate wasn't such a prick, what?

1389
01:31:04,944 --> 01:31:06,986
[SPEAKER_07]: My roommate cleaned up after him sometimes.

1390
01:31:07,166 --> 01:31:07,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, hey, hey.

1391
01:31:07,886 --> 01:31:08,987
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like where you're going with that.

1392
01:31:09,287 --> 01:31:10,108
[SPEAKER_07]: No, hey, honestly.

1393
01:31:10,128 --> 01:31:14,111
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't understand how... Not the nitpick or anything, but... Oh, dear.

1394
01:31:14,191 --> 01:31:17,253
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell do you do in the bathroom that gets water all over the counter?

1395
01:31:17,273 --> 01:31:20,475
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I swear, like, I pick up my stuff on the counter and it's, like, floating.

1396
01:31:21,116 --> 01:31:22,657
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, shit, man.

1397
01:31:22,857 --> 01:31:23,938
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea.

1398
01:31:23,958 --> 01:31:25,198
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll keep track of that.

1399
01:31:25,278 --> 01:31:25,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1400
01:31:25,919 --> 01:31:26,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably shaving.

1401
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:29,902
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, I have that problem with Dan.

1402
01:31:30,990 --> 01:31:36,936
[SPEAKER_13]: because after he gets out of the bathroom for some reason there's an inch of water on the floor and an inch of water on the sink

1403
01:31:37,935 --> 01:31:39,855
[SPEAKER_13]: and I have to grab toilet paper and wipe down the sink.

1404
01:31:40,516 --> 01:31:50,077
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why in my bathroom, even if I get a little bit lax with cleaning off the counter, there's always this spotless ring around the sink from where I've wiped off the pools of water.

1405
01:31:50,878 --> 01:31:53,478
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's like, ugh.

1406
01:31:53,958 --> 01:31:54,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob, you need to clean up.

1407
01:31:54,998 --> 01:31:55,999
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably from shaving.

1408
01:31:56,199 --> 01:31:58,899
[SPEAKER_05]: And I probably just don't notice it because I'm in such a hurry in the morning.

1409
01:31:59,099 --> 01:32:01,200
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will try to be more conscious of it in the future.

1410
01:32:01,860 --> 01:32:05,280
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to get you dust wipes and an electric static duster.

1411
01:32:06,001 --> 01:32:06,401
[SPEAKER_05]: For what?

1412
01:32:06,741 --> 01:32:07,701
[SPEAKER_13]: For your computer area.

1413
01:32:15,548 --> 01:32:24,350
[SPEAKER_05]: I can go to the dollar store and get you an electrostatic duster What else do I have in FU2?

1414
01:32:24,430 --> 01:32:31,972
[SPEAKER_05]: FU2, not getting laid in a long long time, that really sucks And I guess that's it

1415
01:32:33,852 --> 01:32:36,193
[SPEAKER_05]: There was Jamie's little frown face for me, thank you.

1416
01:32:36,893 --> 01:32:38,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Her little unsympathetic loud face.

1417
01:32:39,074 --> 01:32:39,894
[SPEAKER_13]: I found out something.

1418
01:32:40,475 --> 01:32:40,675
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1419
01:32:40,695 --> 01:32:45,897
[SPEAKER_13]: The girl who was the Onee-san in Battle Royale, she's the voice actor for Asuka in Evangelion.

1420
01:32:47,937 --> 01:32:48,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful.

1421
01:32:49,158 --> 01:32:50,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Your useless trivia fact of the day.

1422
01:32:53,439 --> 01:32:57,741
[SPEAKER_07]: I was hoping you'd say that she's like a porn star or something, but, you know, that totally threw me off.

1423
01:33:02,901 --> 01:33:04,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, let's move on.

1424
01:33:04,802 --> 01:33:06,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Zero, do you have any FUs today?

1425
01:33:07,683 --> 01:33:12,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, mine pretty much stem from my little trip to Rain World on Friday.

1426
01:33:13,046 --> 01:33:14,246
[SPEAKER_06]: These were actually pretty good, too.

1427
01:33:14,786 --> 01:33:18,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, one, I was wearing a new shirt, actually the one I got now.

1428
01:33:18,788 --> 01:33:25,931
[SPEAKER_06]: And for those of you who can't read it, it says, um, warning, the person wearing this, um, shirt has been known to make a pass at almost anyone.

1429
01:33:26,672 --> 01:33:29,493
[SPEAKER_06]: If I don't hit on you, there is only one explanation, you ugly.

1430
01:33:30,319 --> 01:33:39,906
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, I go, I'm standing in line after, uh, just waiting to get on a ride, and this lady starts smoking in front of me, right?

1431
01:33:40,006 --> 01:33:45,670
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sitting here thinking, first of all, we are in an enclosed area, which means you're not supposed to be smoking.

1432
01:33:45,690 --> 01:33:47,371
[SPEAKER_06]: And I didn't say that, I just kept to myself.

1433
01:33:48,051 --> 01:33:52,654
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I told my, uh, my friends who were with me, I said, you know, this is, like, really annoying.

1434
01:33:53,035 --> 01:33:59,259
[SPEAKER_06]: And she turns around and, like, screams at me, I don't give a fuck, I can smoke all the fuck I want, blah blah blah.

1435
01:34:00,526 --> 01:34:03,348
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, okay, that's great, I'll just... Actually, no, she can't.

1436
01:34:03,528 --> 01:34:05,469
[SPEAKER_06]: I know she can't because she's in an enclosed area.

1437
01:34:06,269 --> 01:34:12,272
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, and there's a security guard sitting next to me, and I told him, and he told her to put it out, and she wouldn't put it out.

1438
01:34:12,372 --> 01:34:15,834
[SPEAKER_06]: And then she decided to yell at me about my shirt and saying, what, am I not attractive?

1439
01:34:15,874 --> 01:34:17,155
[SPEAKER_06]: And I looked at her and I said, no.

1440
01:34:18,095 --> 01:34:21,657
[SPEAKER_06]: And she was all, your shirt's very offensive, and I said, your smoking's very offensive.

1441
01:34:22,157 --> 01:34:24,679
[SPEAKER_06]: And all your little running around bratty-ass kids are offensive.

1442
01:34:26,147 --> 01:34:32,990
[SPEAKER_06]: And your face is offensive at that point in which you decided to try to storm on me and then the security guards grabbed her and ejected her from the park.

1443
01:34:34,111 --> 01:34:35,391
[SPEAKER_06]: That is how you do it!

1444
01:34:36,512 --> 01:34:46,356
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh... No, and then I have to say fuck you to all the people at Marine World who can't obviously run a fucking ride right.

1445
01:34:46,776 --> 01:34:50,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Every time something comes in, oh, we're having technical difficulties, so you're gonna have to wait for another 45 minutes.

1446
01:34:52,486 --> 01:34:54,267
[SPEAKER_06]: They need, like, pot-smoking Cartys.

1447
01:34:54,748 --> 01:35:00,873
[SPEAKER_06]: And once you, like, do crank and... The Cartys will make a ride work if it doesn't work.

1448
01:35:01,433 --> 01:35:02,714
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't care, they'll put you on it.

1449
01:35:03,395 --> 01:35:13,303
[SPEAKER_06]: But, so yeah, I ended up spending, like, two hours in this one line waiting for a stupid ride, and I was, like, two cars just waiting to go, and I ended up standing there just because I didn't really want to walk and wait in another line.

1450
01:35:14,321 --> 01:35:17,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but still, fuck you to them for being assholes when you ask them what's wrong.

1451
01:35:17,683 --> 01:35:20,785
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, I don't know, I just pushed the buttons.

1452
01:35:21,565 --> 01:35:22,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Stupid bastards.

1453
01:35:23,046 --> 01:35:26,108
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, um, fuck you to the people... What the hell?

1454
01:35:26,768 --> 01:35:27,129
[SPEAKER_06]: They're right.

1455
01:35:27,309 --> 01:35:32,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, fuck you to the people who said that all... Apparently, we up in Sacramento are all known...

1456
01:35:33,052 --> 01:35:34,693
[SPEAKER_06]: to absolutely suck at DDR.

1457
01:35:34,973 --> 01:35:36,114
[SPEAKER_06]: We're the worst DDR.

1458
01:35:36,234 --> 01:35:38,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're the worst DDR players in the world, okay?

1459
01:35:38,835 --> 01:35:40,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Because other people say it, it's true.

1460
01:35:40,916 --> 01:35:49,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I know, but they decided to try to tell me this as I go down there and I mess around on the fourth bus machine, which works perfectly, that's the best place ever.

1461
01:35:49,321 --> 01:35:53,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, I'm thinking, what, March Madness, what, three or four of the top 16 were from Sacramento?

1462
01:35:54,184 --> 01:35:55,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we suck.

1463
01:35:55,124 --> 01:35:57,145
[SPEAKER_05]: We're the worst in the world, don't worry.

1464
01:35:57,185 --> 01:36:01,407
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyways, they decide to come up to me, oh, where do you play at?

1465
01:36:01,427 --> 01:36:03,088
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, I'm from up in Sacramento and all.

1466
01:36:03,128 --> 01:36:04,429
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys suck, and I'm like...

1467
01:36:05,149 --> 01:36:05,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, whatever.

1468
01:36:06,009 --> 01:36:11,071
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they're like, you know, I'm from LA, this other guy's from over here, and we all hang out all the time.

1469
01:36:11,572 --> 01:36:12,752
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, okay, that's great.

1470
01:36:12,852 --> 01:36:13,933
[SPEAKER_06]: No, well, how good are you?

1471
01:36:14,153 --> 01:36:15,733
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I'm okay, I guess.

1472
01:36:16,614 --> 01:36:24,557
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're all, oh, well, this is our best player over here, some little 16-year-old friggin' pimply-faced bastard.

1473
01:36:25,477 --> 01:36:27,618
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're all, well, let's have a dance-off.

1474
01:36:27,658 --> 01:36:29,159
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, what?

1475
01:36:29,419 --> 01:36:33,601
[SPEAKER_06]: First off, first off, first off, anyone that calls it a dance-off...

1476
01:36:35,001 --> 01:36:38,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you should have known right there that... Well, yeah.

1477
01:36:38,343 --> 01:36:40,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I mean, I'm gonna say... I need not say no more.

1478
01:36:40,884 --> 01:36:42,584
[SPEAKER_06]: The kid was pretty good, I guess.

1479
01:36:42,645 --> 01:36:51,028
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, he did play really well, but I mean, for them to sit there and just tell me, just get done telling me how much I suck, and then want to challenge me.

1480
01:36:51,048 --> 01:36:52,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of where you're from.

1481
01:36:52,349 --> 01:36:52,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know.

1482
01:36:52,789 --> 01:36:54,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Not because they've never seen you play.

1483
01:36:54,450 --> 01:36:55,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because of where you're from.

1484
01:36:55,610 --> 01:37:00,893
[SPEAKER_06]: And not to mention, their extremes sucked at that point, because the unlocks were up to sync, and that was it.

1485
01:37:00,953 --> 01:37:03,154
[SPEAKER_06]: So none of the really good songs had been unlocked.

1486
01:37:03,962 --> 01:37:10,514
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, um, so they said, alright, we do best two out of three games, and blah blah, I'm like, fine, alright.

1487
01:37:11,576 --> 01:37:27,449
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we did the first two rounds, the first two games were PA, and surprisingly I beat them, because I never thought I was that good at PA, and I beat them by like a pretty big margin, and then the second round we just went for I guess the overall score of all three songs, and um, huh?

1488
01:37:28,369 --> 01:37:39,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, yeah, but, I mean there was some stupid little thing they said, and I said alright fine, and then I beat them, and then they were all pissed off because I won, and you know, I'm from Sacramento,

1489
01:37:40,459 --> 01:37:46,261
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I came back later, because the guy was going to put in the unlock code, and he did, and Legend of Max is there, and I just wanted to play it.

1490
01:37:47,141 --> 01:37:49,642
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, you know, the happy little winners are there again.

1491
01:37:50,142 --> 01:37:51,942
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're all, can you beat Legend of Max?

1492
01:37:52,003 --> 01:37:55,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, I'd beat it like, maybe 2 out of 18, 20 tries.

1493
01:37:55,504 --> 01:37:55,764
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1494
01:37:56,324 --> 01:37:59,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, um, well he can beat it all the time, why don't you challenge him?

1495
01:37:59,345 --> 01:38:03,186
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, why would you, basically, why would you want to challenge me if I'm so inferior to him?

1496
01:38:03,806 --> 01:38:19,135
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just do it, and I beat it, I think it was like with a C or a D, and he failed it miserably before the freeze, before like the first main freeze, teehee, and they started like telling me magically how good I was and everything, and I said, yeah, all of the Sacramento players are, and I left.

1497
01:38:20,796 --> 01:38:22,677
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I had a good FU to them.

1498
01:38:22,698 --> 01:38:23,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay, zero.

1499
01:38:24,018 --> 01:38:24,819
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd have been like, you know.

1500
01:38:25,871 --> 01:38:31,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, oh yeah, I could beat, uh, you know, I could beat A on Oni, I could beat that on doubles Oni.

1501
01:38:32,353 --> 01:38:34,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I play better doubles than you do.

1502
01:38:35,854 --> 01:38:52,898
[SPEAKER_06]: It was funny when they tried to do, um, doubles, because there was a broom right there where they could have wiped off the machine, and so they didn't, and I watched, like, all three of them try to play doubles and slide right off the side of the machine onto the fourth plus off of the extreme, because they were just too stupid to clean up, and I got up there...

1503
01:38:55,942 --> 01:39:02,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Neither of them have memory slots, but it is still a fourth plus though, which was nice because it was fun to play.

1504
01:39:03,147 --> 01:39:10,351
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's just, you know, if you're going to come up and say people suck and you think they're so bad, don't challenge them to play because they might be better than you.

1505
01:39:11,352 --> 01:39:14,113
[SPEAKER_06]: And an F you with a moral, I like that.

1506
01:39:14,554 --> 01:39:16,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, this match has been brought to you by Zero.

1507
01:39:16,695 --> 01:39:18,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Worthless information and kind words for all.

1508
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:23,923
[SPEAKER_06]: and, yeah, so, fuck them, fuck Marine World, dude, that place is shitty.

1509
01:39:24,343 --> 01:39:28,447
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanna go back to Six Flags of Magic Mountain where the roller coasters actually worked and it was fun.

1510
01:39:29,207 --> 01:39:33,091
[SPEAKER_06]: So, fuck Vallejo and shit like that and their stupid crap.

1511
01:39:34,512 --> 01:39:35,753
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm done because it sucks.

1512
01:39:35,893 --> 01:39:38,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, fuck the government, too, because they're just stupid.

1513
01:39:39,917 --> 01:39:40,677
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't wanna get into it.

1514
01:39:40,757 --> 01:39:41,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1515
01:39:41,978 --> 01:39:42,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

1516
01:39:43,460 --> 01:39:45,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk to the chatroom.

1517
01:39:45,481 --> 01:39:45,662
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1518
01:39:46,222 --> 01:39:47,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, chatroom.

1519
01:39:48,715 --> 01:39:52,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Black Lab would like to give FUs to fucking migraines.

1520
01:39:52,237 --> 01:39:53,497
[SPEAKER_05]: They always ruin things for me.

1521
01:39:53,717 --> 01:39:55,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have been at Rocky last night.

1522
01:39:55,898 --> 01:39:56,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck Easy Mac.

1523
01:39:56,679 --> 01:39:57,539
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sick of it already.

1524
01:39:57,579 --> 01:40:02,781
[SPEAKER_05]: There would be more, but my roommate finally moved out, and I have the room to myself for the next five weeks, and that makes me happy.

1525
01:40:06,323 --> 01:40:11,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Stapler X would like to say FU to annoying bitches who can't stay quiet in a fucking screening room.

1526
01:40:11,965 --> 01:40:12,966
[SPEAKER_05]: And, of course, the president.

1527
01:40:14,406 --> 01:40:16,627
[SPEAKER_05]: No reason given, just FU.

1528
01:40:19,758 --> 01:40:25,784
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkDeadSui would like to say, fuck having to wait for E3 and the official footage of MGS3, Metal Gear Solid 3.

1529
01:40:27,225 --> 01:40:33,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, he would like to give a suggestion that perhaps the game you were thinking about earlier, Jamie, Stepping Selection or Stepping Stage.

1530
01:40:33,351 --> 01:40:35,252
[SPEAKER_13]: Stepping Selection, that game sucks.

1531
01:40:36,193 --> 01:40:36,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there you have it.

1532
01:40:37,855 --> 01:40:38,495
[SPEAKER_13]: It's funny, though.

1533
01:40:40,217 --> 01:40:42,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Rice, RYC3, would like to say, yes?

1534
01:40:42,839 --> 01:40:44,401
[SPEAKER_13]: It had that Samantha Fox song in it.

1535
01:40:45,248 --> 01:40:45,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?

1536
01:40:45,748 --> 01:40:46,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

1537
01:40:46,129 --> 01:40:47,769
[SPEAKER_13]: We put into circulation.

1538
01:40:47,990 --> 01:40:49,250
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, oh, the Santa Maria?

1539
01:40:49,510 --> 01:40:49,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1540
01:40:49,771 --> 01:40:50,431
[SPEAKER_11]: Santa Maria.

1541
01:40:50,491 --> 01:40:50,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's cool.

1542
01:40:50,891 --> 01:40:51,351
[SPEAKER_13]: It had that song.

1543
01:40:51,592 --> 01:40:51,832
[SPEAKER_13]: Neat.

1544
01:40:53,313 --> 01:40:55,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Rice would like to say, Fuck you to the obnoxious lady at work.

1545
01:40:56,034 --> 01:40:56,975
[SPEAKER_05]: God, you were annoying.

1546
01:40:57,135 --> 01:40:59,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you to stupid bitches at Sherman Oaks Castle Park.

1547
01:41:00,156 --> 01:41:02,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you to people who take my sarcasm lively.

1548
01:41:03,258 --> 01:41:04,118
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he meant literally.

1549
01:41:04,559 --> 01:41:04,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1550
01:41:05,699 --> 01:41:07,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe he meant lively.

1551
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:07,640
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see that.

1552
01:41:07,660 --> 01:41:08,801
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a workable adjective.

1553
01:41:09,782 --> 01:41:10,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Sarcasm.

1554
01:41:11,362 --> 01:41:13,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you to people who take my sarcasm lively.

1555
01:41:13,244 --> 01:41:13,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, guys.

1556
01:41:15,137 --> 01:41:17,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't the Hi Guys joke like years old now?

1557
01:41:19,301 --> 01:41:20,122
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys need a new one.

1558
01:41:20,382 --> 01:41:23,085
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys get a new mascot every now and then and that's cool.

1559
01:41:23,125 --> 01:41:25,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you went from Bob Saget to somebody else, right?

1560
01:41:25,968 --> 01:41:26,909
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys need a new one.

1561
01:41:29,051 --> 01:41:29,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

1562
01:41:29,772 --> 01:41:30,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, DJ Konami for a while.

1563
01:41:34,630 --> 01:41:42,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Those of you that are changing your nicknames in the chatroom better change them back or your FUs aren't going to get credited the right people because I haven't been following who you've been changing your names to.

1564
01:41:42,394 --> 01:41:43,035
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be right back.

1565
01:41:43,055 --> 01:41:43,575
[SPEAKER_07]: In the meantime.

1566
01:41:43,795 --> 01:41:45,236
[SPEAKER_07]: I figured I'd run with you for my cage match.

1567
01:41:45,276 --> 01:41:46,397
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be right back.

1568
01:41:46,717 --> 01:41:47,997
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got to get a CD out of my car.

1569
01:41:48,478 --> 01:41:48,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1570
01:41:49,618 --> 01:41:53,461
[SPEAKER_05]: John Fields would like to say FU to DVD burners that don't work right.

1571
01:41:54,001 --> 01:41:56,703
[SPEAKER_05]: FU weather storms that knock off my favorite network.

1572
01:41:57,623 --> 01:42:00,165
[SPEAKER_05]: FU to Microsoft for thinking up the ILU.

1573
01:42:01,325 --> 01:42:01,646
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

1574
01:42:02,946 --> 01:42:04,207
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it like a portable toilet?

1575
01:42:05,628 --> 01:42:09,211
[SPEAKER_07]: I wrote a small piece on it on the thing.

1576
01:42:09,251 --> 01:42:10,531
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, thank you MSN.

1577
01:42:11,872 --> 01:42:14,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I can surf the net and take a shit at the same time.

1578
01:42:16,215 --> 01:42:21,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Or as they said on Saturday Night Live last night, they're all, yes, use the ILU, log in and log out.

1579
01:42:23,860 --> 01:42:24,581
[SPEAKER_05]: That's horrible.

1580
01:42:25,061 --> 01:42:26,242
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember the love toilet.

1581
01:42:27,279 --> 01:42:33,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't they call it the iPoo?

1582
01:42:33,147 --> 01:42:34,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's the Lou in Europe.

1583
01:42:34,549 --> 01:42:34,910
[SPEAKER_05]: I get it.

1584
01:42:36,432 --> 01:42:37,934
[SPEAKER_05]: We're so cultured here on Orange College Radio.

1585
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:42,020
[SPEAKER_05]: SnubDisponoid would like to say a whole lot.

1586
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:42,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.

1587
01:42:44,102 --> 01:42:47,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you, Symphony, for ruining a perfectly good day of sitting on my ass.

1588
01:42:47,344 --> 01:42:48,204
[SPEAKER_05]: What a pain in the ass.

1589
01:42:48,284 --> 01:42:48,884
[SPEAKER_05]: No, seriously.

1590
01:42:49,225 --> 01:42:58,349
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of sitting on my ass at home in a padded office chair, I have to sit on wire-framed chairs that seem to be instruments of torture and rape and play some really shitty music.

1591
01:42:58,409 --> 01:42:58,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck that.

1592
01:42:59,310 --> 01:43:01,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, what the hell is with all this Korean crap?

1593
01:43:01,311 --> 01:43:03,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Pump It Up, Ragnarok Online, who gives a crap?

1594
01:43:03,292 --> 01:43:08,414
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a bunch of other MMORPGs out there that are much better and much less repetitive than Pump It Up Sex.

1595
01:43:09,535 --> 01:43:10,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you like to respond to that, Jamie?

1596
01:43:10,836 --> 01:43:11,416
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck you, buddy.

1597
01:43:12,276 --> 01:43:13,437
[SPEAKER_13]: I like Ragnarok Online.

1598
01:43:15,297 --> 01:43:17,478
[SPEAKER_13]: I have more fun playing it and it's free.

1599
01:43:18,678 --> 01:43:19,038
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1600
01:43:19,078 --> 01:43:19,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Free is a good thing.

1601
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:23,120
[SPEAKER_13]: And my thief is level 26.

1602
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:24,921
[SPEAKER_05]: I still like that.

1603
01:43:25,201 --> 01:43:28,422
[SPEAKER_13]: And it makes me think of Secret of Mana.

1604
01:43:28,582 --> 01:43:29,902
[SPEAKER_13]: So I like it and all my friends are on it.

1605
01:43:31,243 --> 01:43:31,583
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1606
01:43:32,878 --> 01:43:35,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Pump It Up, a sort of metaphor for what the Korean language is.

1607
01:43:35,739 --> 01:43:45,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Korean is basically Japanese kanji with circles and extra crap that make it seem really stupid and hard to understand, and Pump It Up is Japanese DDR with an extra arrow with a bunch of extra crap that slows it down.

1608
01:43:47,085 --> 01:43:47,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, here we go.

1609
01:43:47,726 --> 01:43:48,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another FU.

1610
01:43:49,567 --> 01:43:50,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck marshmallows.

1611
01:43:50,708 --> 01:43:52,289
[SPEAKER_05]: They make me fucking throw up.

1612
01:43:52,349 --> 01:43:53,209
[SPEAKER_05]: And fuck fries.

1613
01:43:53,329 --> 01:43:56,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki reminded me of my painful experiences with fries.

1614
01:43:56,772 --> 01:44:04,297
[SPEAKER_05]: You think that the employees being paid commission would stop them from being shit-nosed assholes sucking dirty ass cock gobblers.

1615
01:44:04,577 --> 01:44:09,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, you know, fries really does suck, but they actually did something good for me the other day.

1616
01:44:09,941 --> 01:44:12,843
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is like... Well, no, they didn't even have any.

1617
01:44:13,223 --> 01:44:14,204
[SPEAKER_06]: They were sold out.

1618
01:44:14,785 --> 01:44:14,945
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1619
01:44:15,545 --> 01:44:16,566
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually did a good...

1620
01:44:17,452 --> 01:44:23,457
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually did a good job and actually, you know, sold me the right thing for my computer for once.

1621
01:44:24,138 --> 01:44:26,900
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a miracle when I needed a PlayStation adapter.

1622
01:44:26,980 --> 01:44:30,983
[SPEAKER_06]: They knew exactly where that was, but they couldn't tell me where the fuck the hard drives were right in front of their face.

1623
01:44:31,944 --> 01:44:32,745
[SPEAKER_06]: So, fuck them.

1624
01:44:33,505 --> 01:44:34,926
[SPEAKER_05]: And then at the end of that rant, he said, Oh, free.

1625
01:44:41,855 --> 01:44:45,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, moving on, let's go to some more FUs of the week, shall we?

1626
01:44:45,377 --> 01:44:53,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk to the 23rd Magus who would like to say, FU to Kentucky, again, yeah, I mean it this time, Bernier, because I say so Chicken!

1627
01:44:53,243 --> 01:44:53,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Chicken!

1628
01:44:54,564 --> 01:45:07,993
[SPEAKER_05]: FU to people who think they know me You don't know me, you don't know my life, you don't know And who think they know what I'm thinking, you're not psychic, bitches, go see Miss Cleo And finally, FU to not being able to go to Scandia for lack of money, my skills are slipping, dammit

1629
01:45:08,740 --> 01:45:10,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the part where you go, what skills?

1630
01:45:11,222 --> 01:45:12,963
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding.

1631
01:45:13,924 --> 01:45:14,504
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so mean.

1632
01:45:14,544 --> 01:45:16,866
[SPEAKER_05]: You mean his totally elite freestyling skills?

1633
01:45:17,066 --> 01:45:18,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Must keep passing eights.

1634
01:45:18,707 --> 01:45:19,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Rawr.

1635
01:45:19,147 --> 01:45:19,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, out.

1636
01:45:20,708 --> 01:45:21,068
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1637
01:45:21,929 --> 01:45:22,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Rock on.

1638
01:45:24,352 --> 01:45:24,792
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's next?

1639
01:45:25,413 --> 01:45:25,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi!

1640
01:45:25,493 --> 01:45:25,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that reminds me.

1641
01:45:25,894 --> 01:45:26,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1642
01:45:26,715 --> 01:45:26,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Grr, grr, grr.

1643
01:45:26,955 --> 01:45:27,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1644
01:45:40,695 --> 01:45:43,576
[SPEAKER_05]: F you to that little kid who was sitting behind us next to you.

1645
01:45:43,596 --> 01:45:44,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it was like this whole little family.

1646
01:45:45,076 --> 01:45:46,216
[SPEAKER_05]: And they didn't even speak English.

1647
01:45:46,276 --> 01:45:47,477
[SPEAKER_05]: They spoke Russian or something.

1648
01:45:47,797 --> 01:45:49,137
[SPEAKER_05]: And, like, there were three kids.

1649
01:45:49,417 --> 01:45:51,378
[SPEAKER_05]: And they would, like, shake the seat and stuff.

1650
01:45:51,438 --> 01:45:54,598
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would just, like, turn around and stare and be all, What the hell do you think you're doing?

1651
01:45:54,638 --> 01:45:55,378
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, type thing.

1652
01:45:55,839 --> 01:45:56,659
[SPEAKER_05]: They're stupid.

1653
01:45:56,999 --> 01:45:59,899
[SPEAKER_05]: They were really stupid because they had no idea, like, why I was mad.

1654
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:02,360
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate kids.

1655
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:06,321
[SPEAKER_05]: There should be a law against bringing certain age children into a movie theater.

1656
01:46:08,038 --> 01:46:08,398
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

1657
01:46:08,438 --> 01:46:12,882
[SPEAKER_05]: And as far as like, well, I don't realize there's somewhat laws in R and X, but that should be like punishable by death.

1658
01:46:13,022 --> 01:46:18,246
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't remember what theater I was at, but there was this kid there who was doing that to me, and her parent was right next to them.

1659
01:46:18,746 --> 01:46:28,634
[SPEAKER_13]: And I turned around, and I told their, it was like the mom or something, that if she didn't control her child, I'd report her to child services, to child protection services.

1660
01:46:29,374 --> 01:46:30,115
[SPEAKER_13]: And she was like, what?

1661
01:46:30,435 --> 01:46:34,979
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, yeah, because it's going to be for neglect, because I'm going to take your child and ship them off to some third world country in slavery.

1662
01:46:36,994 --> 01:46:39,095
[SPEAKER_13]: And she just looked at me and her child never did it again.

1663
01:46:41,076 --> 01:46:43,438
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, God, I hate kids.

1664
01:46:44,118 --> 01:46:44,818
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I should do?

1665
01:46:44,838 --> 01:46:47,220
[SPEAKER_05]: I should open up a movie theater where children are banned.

1666
01:46:47,460 --> 01:46:49,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be the richest fucking man on the planet.

1667
01:46:50,742 --> 01:46:53,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Our Dave and Buster's creation will also have a movie theater.

1668
01:46:54,144 --> 01:46:54,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1669
01:46:56,539 --> 01:46:59,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I swear to God, Loki, we need to get alone and make this.

1670
01:46:59,842 --> 01:47:04,146
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to make our Dave & Buster slash movie theater slash children-free world.

1671
01:47:04,506 --> 01:47:05,407
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be beautiful.

1672
01:47:05,787 --> 01:47:07,669
[SPEAKER_05]: I would cry cheers of joy.

1673
01:47:09,390 --> 01:47:10,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Poor new land.

1674
01:47:11,912 --> 01:47:12,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

1675
01:47:13,013 --> 01:47:14,214
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what else you need in there?

1676
01:47:14,234 --> 01:47:16,616
[SPEAKER_13]: You need the Discovery Zone in there with no children.

1677
01:47:17,437 --> 01:47:18,818
[SPEAKER_13]: All those nets and balls and things.

1678
01:47:20,379 --> 01:47:23,082
[SPEAKER_13]: I used to take my brothers there just so that I could go play.

1679
01:47:24,184 --> 01:47:25,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, one more FU from the chatroom.

1680
01:47:25,605 --> 01:47:26,526
[SPEAKER_13]: I used to take naps in there.

1681
01:47:29,328 --> 01:47:33,871
[SPEAKER_05]: RiceLYC3 would like to say, fuck you to my computer for buffering too much.

1682
01:47:34,752 --> 01:47:38,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Means you gotta get broadband, or if you are on broadband, you need to get better broadband, I guess.

1683
01:47:38,534 --> 01:47:39,155
[SPEAKER_05]: More memory!

1684
01:47:40,616 --> 01:47:43,218
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it, that there completes the FUs of the week.

1685
01:47:43,538 --> 01:47:44,338
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay.

1686
01:47:47,281 --> 01:47:47,801
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, Loki?

1687
01:47:49,557 --> 01:47:53,119
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still going on air after I see The Matrix on Thursday.

1688
01:47:53,159 --> 01:47:54,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Just go say how cool it is.

1689
01:47:55,240 --> 01:47:55,941
[SPEAKER_07]: I won't give it away.

1690
01:47:56,241 --> 01:47:58,222
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you going to talk about?

1691
01:47:58,282 --> 01:47:59,963
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just going to sit there and go, it was so cool, man.

1692
01:48:00,163 --> 01:48:03,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, that one part, I can't tell you about it, but that one part where they did that thing.

1693
01:48:03,825 --> 01:48:04,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, oh, it's cool.

1694
01:48:07,888 --> 01:48:09,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, pretty much like that.

1695
01:48:13,291 --> 01:48:16,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I guess now's a good time to take a break, but I'm actually thinking let's just do Cage Match now.

1696
01:48:17,990 --> 01:48:18,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure!

1697
01:48:18,811 --> 01:48:22,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so, let us do the cage match.

1698
01:48:23,515 --> 01:48:24,276
[SPEAKER_05]: That will be fun.

1699
01:48:25,737 --> 01:48:27,719
[SPEAKER_05]: That will be more fun than a barrel of monkeys.

1700
01:48:30,282 --> 01:48:31,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you find your cage match song, Loki?

1701
01:48:32,424 --> 01:48:32,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

1702
01:48:34,165 --> 01:48:36,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's go into the Orange Lounge cage match.

1703
01:48:38,349 --> 01:48:40,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Last week, on the Orange Lounge cage match...

1704
01:48:42,438 --> 01:48:45,440
[SPEAKER_05]: A real shocker, I don't know how this song won, but it did.

1705
01:48:45,540 --> 01:48:47,601
[SPEAKER_05]: It won by a very narrow margin, I must say.

1706
01:48:49,062 --> 01:48:51,944
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um... Oh god, did I just fuck up my computer?

1707
01:48:55,506 --> 01:48:56,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on a minute, kids.

1708
01:48:56,466 --> 01:49:04,971
[SPEAKER_05]: I accidentally copied one folder somewhere else, and now... I don't know if I can undo.

1709
01:49:04,991 --> 01:49:06,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Son of a bitch.

1710
01:49:07,033 --> 01:49:09,174
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're running Windows, hit Ctrl-Z and it'll undo it.

1711
01:49:11,926 --> 01:49:12,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on a minute, kids.

1712
01:49:14,628 --> 01:49:16,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we gotta take a really fast break.

1713
01:49:16,309 --> 01:49:16,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, you guys.

1714
01:49:17,449 --> 01:49:18,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I fucked something up.

1715
01:49:18,570 --> 01:49:21,972
[SPEAKER_05]: I moved my MIRC directory somewhere else, and now I can't access half my files.

1716
01:49:22,012 --> 01:49:22,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta move it back.

1717
01:49:23,973 --> 01:49:25,034
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll take a really quick break.

1718
01:49:25,054 --> 01:49:26,534
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be right back, and we'll do the cage match.

1719
01:49:26,575 --> 01:49:27,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry!

1720
01:49:42,525 --> 01:49:43,125
and many more.

1721
01:50:29,250 --> 01:50:29,951
[SPEAKER_17]: The Stars Hi

1722
01:51:31,247 --> 01:51:32,036
[SPEAKER_17]: and now the win.

1723
01:52:32,631 --> 01:52:36,672
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, that was, and then our mics were off during that whole little past thing, my bad.

1724
01:52:38,273 --> 01:52:38,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, oops.

1725
01:52:38,893 --> 01:52:42,334
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they're like, why is the cage match music playing and no one's talking?

1726
01:52:42,394 --> 01:52:42,654
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops.

1727
01:52:42,894 --> 01:52:46,775
[SPEAKER_05]: She's on that I Love the 80s show every once in a while on VH1.

1728
01:52:47,035 --> 01:52:49,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, that was last week's winner that you just heard a little clip of that.

1729
01:52:49,676 --> 01:52:50,356
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Raven Simone.

1730
01:52:50,396 --> 01:52:52,397
[SPEAKER_11]: We were doing crisscross effort in the background.

1731
01:52:52,417 --> 01:52:54,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Who was the youngest girl on the Cosby show with That's What Little Girls Are Made Of.

1732
01:52:55,018 --> 01:52:57,218
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the first song you can vote for in tonight's cage match.

1733
01:52:57,238 --> 01:52:59,639
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was Raven Simone, That's What Little Girls Are Made Of.

1734
01:53:00,299 --> 01:53:01,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that was last week's winner.

1735
01:53:01,700 --> 01:53:03,400
[SPEAKER_13]: I wasn't here to rate it, so it gets a three.

1736
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:04,161
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1737
01:53:04,941 --> 01:53:06,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you weren't here to rate it, that's right.

1738
01:53:06,461 --> 01:53:08,222
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I was having a personal crisis.

1739
01:53:08,262 --> 01:53:10,543
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, you left mid-show for reasons.

1740
01:53:10,763 --> 01:53:11,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Personal crisis!

1741
01:53:11,764 --> 01:53:12,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Personal crisis.

1742
01:53:12,584 --> 01:53:13,304
[SPEAKER_13]: An incredible crisis.

1743
01:53:16,005 --> 01:53:20,347
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you can vote for that, and I think you should, because it would be wonderful if that song won again.

1744
01:53:21,107 --> 01:53:24,929
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's see how many private messages I got saying to turn on the damn mics.

1745
01:53:26,169 --> 01:53:27,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, actually, I didn't get any.

1746
01:53:28,310 --> 01:53:29,451
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do have a question.

1747
01:53:29,491 --> 01:53:30,751
[SPEAKER_05]: This has nothing to do with the cage match.

1748
01:53:31,332 --> 01:53:34,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, when are you going to have time to do more work on the Battle Royale roleplay?

1749
01:53:35,794 --> 01:53:37,475
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, who's that from?

1750
01:53:38,715 --> 01:53:39,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Puppy.

1751
01:53:39,616 --> 01:53:39,916
[SPEAKER_13]: Puppy?

1752
01:53:40,837 --> 01:53:44,458
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, Puppy, we'll work on it Tuesday night if I'm not out.

1753
01:53:45,079 --> 01:53:45,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1754
01:53:45,419 --> 01:53:47,340
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm not going to be up late because I'm working now.

1755
01:53:47,740 --> 01:53:47,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1756
01:53:48,881 --> 01:53:50,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, into the cage match.

1757
01:53:50,261 --> 01:53:50,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to the cage match.

1758
01:53:51,042 --> 01:53:53,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what track on the CD do we want here?

1759
01:53:56,799 --> 01:54:06,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, son of a bitch, it's not showing me the... It's a, it's a, um, um... Oh, God, I gotta use Windows Media Player to do this.

1760
01:54:06,844 --> 01:54:08,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on a sec, we might have a drop.

1761
01:54:08,745 --> 01:54:09,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's CD Player?

1762
01:54:11,586 --> 01:54:15,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Accessories, Entertainment... I don't have a CD Player.

1763
01:54:16,129 --> 01:54:19,130
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think XP has one, because you brought in the Media Player.

1764
01:54:19,170 --> 01:54:20,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on, we might have a couple drops here.

1765
01:54:22,592 --> 01:54:23,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what's your pick this week?

1766
01:54:23,933 --> 01:54:24,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us about it.

1767
01:54:29,065 --> 01:54:35,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, my pick this week is from the upcoming movie, which is in four days, Matrix Reloaded.

1768
01:54:36,010 --> 01:54:38,752
[SPEAKER_07]: As part of the score, it's actually really awesome.

1769
01:54:38,793 --> 01:54:42,896
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the scene that they're going to be having that kick-ass awesome car chase scene.

1770
01:54:43,596 --> 01:54:47,179
[SPEAKER_07]: This is also named after a book that came out a while back.

1771
01:54:47,879 --> 01:54:49,681
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Mona Lisa Overdrive.

1772
01:54:49,801 --> 01:54:52,063
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Juno Reactor and Don Davis.

1773
01:54:53,371 --> 01:54:55,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, are we really playing the whole ten minutes of this?

1774
01:54:56,134 --> 01:54:58,075
[SPEAKER_07]: We can play like five to eight minutes.

1775
01:54:58,596 --> 01:55:04,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we're going to play a portion of this song, because Loki actually does have an edit of this, but we can't play that right now.

1776
01:55:04,802 --> 01:55:09,906
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the edit of it is on my computer, but my sound card sucks ass, and so, yeah.

1777
01:55:10,087 --> 01:55:15,652
[SPEAKER_07]: But because there's an edit of it, that's because I'm doing it for Tourney Mix 4, so look for that.

1778
01:55:16,983 --> 01:55:17,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so here it is.

1779
01:55:17,604 --> 01:55:19,647
[SPEAKER_05]: This is part of Mona Lisa Overdrive.

1780
01:55:19,667 --> 01:55:23,452
[SPEAKER_05]: But be advised that if you vote for this song, it'll probably be cut down a little bit.

1781
01:55:23,472 --> 01:55:24,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we're only going to play a little bit cut.

1782
01:55:24,954 --> 01:55:26,777
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just going to kind of play like a few minutes of it.

1783
01:55:26,817 --> 01:55:30,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's a ten minute long song, so we're not going to have the whole thing in rotation.

1784
01:55:30,321 --> 01:55:31,783
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have an edit if it wins.

1785
01:55:31,904 --> 01:55:32,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay?

1786
01:55:32,404 --> 01:55:32,865
[SPEAKER_05]: So here it is.

1787
01:55:33,025 --> 01:55:33,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy.

1788
01:56:34,051 --> 01:56:35,712
[SPEAKER_20]: Music Music Music Music

1789
01:57:04,123 --> 01:57:05,691
Thanks for watching!

1790
01:57:34,030 --> 01:57:35,873
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura

1791
02:02:02,177 --> 02:02:02,277
3, 2, 1, GO!

1792
02:02:40,290 --> 02:02:43,492
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, that was Loki's pick, Mona Lisa Overdrive, a little edit of that.

1793
02:02:44,913 --> 02:02:48,215
[SPEAKER_05]: If it does win, there's going to be an edit put in rotation that's even shorter.

1794
02:02:48,235 --> 02:02:52,719
[SPEAKER_05]: It just pretty much has the techno parts of it.

1795
02:02:52,939 --> 02:02:53,439
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's cool.

1796
02:02:53,539 --> 02:02:54,260
[SPEAKER_05]: The edit's really cool.

1797
02:02:54,280 --> 02:02:55,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully we can play the edit for you at the end of the show.

1798
02:02:55,781 --> 02:02:57,742
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just having some problems on Loki's computer right now.

1799
02:02:58,322 --> 02:03:01,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, let's go around the room and see what people thought, starting with Jenny, because she has the mic.

1800
02:03:03,974 --> 02:03:07,056
[SPEAKER_13]: It definitely sounded like something that's supposed to go behind something.

1801
02:03:07,657 --> 02:03:16,984
[SPEAKER_13]: It wouldn't be something that I would want to listen to over and over and over again, so... But it didn't suck, it's just not something that I would, you know, listen to a lot of, so I'd give it an 8.

1802
02:03:17,084 --> 02:03:17,424
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1803
02:03:19,245 --> 02:03:19,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Brad.

1804
02:03:20,626 --> 02:03:21,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Brad and Irene are here.

1805
02:03:22,168 --> 02:03:23,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hi Brad and Irene, who got here, by the way.

1806
02:03:24,329 --> 02:03:24,750
[SPEAKER_22]: Wrangles.

1807
02:03:27,099 --> 02:03:28,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was a good song.

1808
02:03:29,100 --> 02:03:31,121
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of agree, it's a soundtrack song.

1809
02:03:31,421 --> 02:03:34,523
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to see the movie, I'm sure it's going to kick ass there.

1810
02:03:34,563 --> 02:03:35,863
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a good song, I'd give it a 9.

1811
02:03:37,424 --> 02:03:38,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Irene, the rights princess.

1812
02:03:40,565 --> 02:03:43,507
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a short attention span, and it was a long song.

1813
02:03:43,947 --> 02:03:47,669
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't mean it was bad, it's just hard for me to concentrate on it.

1814
02:03:48,129 --> 02:03:49,890
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I know, it's like a freaking long song.

1815
02:03:50,250 --> 02:03:56,093
[SPEAKER_10]: But it was a good song, like I mean, for a soundtrack song, I mean it was good, so I'd give it an 8.

1816
02:03:57,313 --> 02:03:57,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, 0.

1817
02:04:00,594 --> 02:04:05,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Going by the fact that it's even on the movie, I would give it a 10, but I can't do that because I wouldn't be nice.

1818
02:04:05,976 --> 02:04:09,978
[SPEAKER_06]: No, actually, it definitely seems like something, yeah, that would be on a movie.

1819
02:04:09,998 --> 02:04:18,381
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not something that you'd hear anywhere else except the soundtrack or the movie, but I liked it a lot, and I actually downloaded it, and I think I enjoyed it.

1820
02:04:18,421 --> 02:04:18,901
[SPEAKER_06]: I give it like a 9.

1821
02:04:18,941 --> 02:04:19,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1822
02:04:21,102 --> 02:04:23,324
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fucking awesome, dude.

1823
02:04:23,344 --> 02:04:28,567
[SPEAKER_07]: I've listened to that song, I kid you not, 60 times at least since I've gotten this soundtrack.

1824
02:04:28,948 --> 02:04:30,148
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was only a couple days ago.

1825
02:04:30,449 --> 02:04:32,290
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's awesome driving music.

1826
02:04:32,370 --> 02:04:33,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect for driving.

1827
02:04:33,351 --> 02:04:35,472
[SPEAKER_07]: You just get going and it's like, yeah!

1828
02:04:35,952 --> 02:04:36,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Your own track, real fast.

1829
02:04:37,333 --> 02:04:38,474
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but it's really awesome.

1830
02:04:38,494 --> 02:04:43,918
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish you guys could listen to the whole thing because it does pick up even more afterwards and gets really cool techno-y stuff.

1831
02:04:44,298 --> 02:04:49,642
[SPEAKER_07]: But like I said before, it is going to be my pick for Tourney Mix 4 and you're going to hear a pretty good cut of it then.

1832
02:05:06,425 --> 02:05:08,047
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I have an unfair advantage.

1833
02:05:08,087 --> 02:05:15,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard that edit that Loki's done, the two and a half minute edit, and he really has taken all the best parts of the song and made it a standalone song.

1834
02:05:15,414 --> 02:05:19,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, he took all the... It kind of sounds a little tackish, actually, to me.

1835
02:05:20,319 --> 02:05:23,442
[SPEAKER_13]: I did kind of think of that, but... Back to the soundtrack thing.

1836
02:05:23,763 --> 02:05:24,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1837
02:05:24,604 --> 02:05:28,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, there's another song in there called just Chateau that does sound like Gravity.

1838
02:05:28,488 --> 02:05:29,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh!

1839
02:05:30,469 --> 02:05:32,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Wouldn't it be cool if they detected the soundtrack?

1840
02:05:32,650 --> 02:05:35,311
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be, let's do it, that is a topic of discussion when we come back.

1841
02:05:35,351 --> 02:05:37,052
[SPEAKER_05]: The money artists we want to see do movie scores.

1842
02:05:37,072 --> 02:05:41,693
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, um, I think that, um, I think it's a good song.

1843
02:05:41,713 --> 02:05:45,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the edit's really, really good, and that if that goes into rotation, it'll be fine.

1844
02:05:45,835 --> 02:05:46,695
[SPEAKER_05]: So I give it a nine.

1845
02:05:47,216 --> 02:05:48,196
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good song, it really is.

1846
02:05:48,596 --> 02:05:56,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but yeah, we just, if I heard all that kind of symphonic stuff during the dance, our normal Domani music, I'd probably go to sleep.

1847
02:05:57,532 --> 02:06:02,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think it should be mentioned that I was going to do a remix with that being part of the remix.

1848
02:06:02,714 --> 02:06:08,716
[SPEAKER_07]: That was supposed to be entered into the remixing contest, which is the deadline is tomorrow, but I don't think that's going to happen.

1849
02:06:09,177 --> 02:06:10,797
[SPEAKER_07]: But I was planning on doing a remix of it.

1850
02:06:13,778 --> 02:06:15,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's get into Jamie's pick.

1851
02:06:15,059 --> 02:06:16,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, what did you bring to the table today?

1852
02:06:16,199 --> 02:06:16,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine's old.

1853
02:06:17,300 --> 02:06:22,342
[SPEAKER_13]: I couldn't think of anything else again, so I just picked Herbie Hancock Rocket.

1854
02:06:23,041 --> 02:06:24,082
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is from a game, isn't it?

1855
02:06:24,383 --> 02:06:26,906
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, they did it in different versions of Amplitude.

1856
02:06:27,206 --> 02:06:30,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but this is a cool song, so here's your last pick for tonight.

1857
02:06:30,330 --> 02:06:32,212
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Herbie Hancock with Rocket.

1858
02:12:06,125 --> 02:12:08,986
[SPEAKER_05]: All righty, that was Herbie Hancock with Rocket.

1859
02:12:09,826 --> 02:12:10,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Hope you all enjoyed that one.

1860
02:12:12,067 --> 02:12:15,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go around and see what everyone else thought of Herbie Hancock, Rocket.

1861
02:12:15,788 --> 02:12:17,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting off with Jamie.

1862
02:12:18,088 --> 02:12:18,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Ten.

1863
02:12:19,529 --> 02:12:20,629
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to give any reasons why?

1864
02:12:22,109 --> 02:12:22,429
[SPEAKER_11]: Ten.

1865
02:12:23,129 --> 02:12:23,450
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1866
02:12:25,070 --> 02:12:25,810
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take that as a no.

1867
02:12:26,670 --> 02:12:27,971
[SPEAKER_05]: Irene, any of you, what do you think?

1868
02:12:27,991 --> 02:12:28,331
[SPEAKER_10]: I liked it a lot.

1869
02:12:28,611 --> 02:12:29,551
[SPEAKER_10]: I liked it a lot, nine.

1870
02:12:30,311 --> 02:12:30,571
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1871
02:12:31,992 --> 02:12:32,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1872
02:12:34,261 --> 02:12:36,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Zero, what did you think of Herbie Hancock Rocket?

1873
02:12:42,096 --> 02:12:43,337
[SPEAKER_06]: What don't I think of that song?

1874
02:12:43,937 --> 02:12:58,064
[SPEAKER_06]: No, actually, that is the second song of the 80s I remember, besides that super happy stalker song by The Police, but I give that song a 10, just because it's been a favorite of mine forever.

1875
02:12:59,165 --> 02:13:00,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Brad, do you have anything you want to say?

1876
02:13:01,486 --> 02:13:00,346
10.

1877
02:13:01,886 --> 02:13:02,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Brad gives it a 10.

1878
02:13:02,507 --> 02:13:04,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Brad throws a 10 out through the door.

1879
02:13:06,322 --> 02:13:07,784
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that song, it's pretty cool.

1880
02:13:08,064 --> 02:13:17,198
[SPEAKER_05]: If they ever did like a 2DX classic version or something, and like brought back a bunch of old 80s songs, I would cry my eyes out if that was not in it.

1881
02:13:17,358 --> 02:13:18,880
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm working on a file for the 2DX...

1882
02:13:21,486 --> 02:13:24,287
[SPEAKER_06]: And now, the winning song of the week

1883
02:13:53,231 --> 02:13:57,833
[SPEAKER_05]: You can vote for The Matrix Reloaded with Mona Lisa Overdrive, which I can't play a clip of now.

1884
02:13:59,193 --> 02:14:01,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Play a small little clip and I'll hold the mic up.

1885
02:14:01,214 --> 02:14:03,235
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hooked up now.

1886
02:14:03,255 --> 02:14:03,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, is it hooked up now?

1887
02:14:03,895 --> 02:14:04,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Then play a little clip.

1888
02:14:11,618 --> 02:14:13,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that's Mona Lisa Overdrive.

1889
02:14:13,579 --> 02:14:15,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you can vote for Herbie Hancock with Rocket.

1890
02:14:25,916 --> 02:14:27,356
[SPEAKER_05]: That was kind of a bad part of the song I picked.

1891
02:14:27,396 --> 02:14:27,697
[SPEAKER_05]: My bad.

1892
02:14:27,717 --> 02:14:29,117
[SPEAKER_05]: But you just heard it, so you remember it.

1893
02:14:29,437 --> 02:14:30,117
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, there you go.

1894
02:14:30,157 --> 02:14:32,998
[SPEAKER_05]: You can vote for Raven-Symoné, Mona Lisa, Overdrive, Herbie Hancock.

1895
02:14:33,518 --> 02:14:37,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Send those votes now over private message to Sky in the chat room.

1896
02:14:37,680 --> 02:14:40,601
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're not in our chat room, get your fucking butt in there right now.

1897
02:14:40,681 --> 02:14:42,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Go over to Calibamani.com.

1898
02:14:42,801 --> 02:14:43,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Click on Orange Lounge.

1899
02:14:43,481 --> 02:14:43,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Click on Chat.

1900
02:14:43,862 --> 02:14:46,262
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm glad I picked that song because it makes you say cock a lot.

1901
02:14:49,083 --> 02:14:50,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Herbie Hancock.

1902
02:14:51,144 --> 02:14:51,544
Cock rock.

1903
02:14:51,792 --> 02:14:53,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they're getting in quite a fight in the chat room right now.

1904
02:14:54,253 --> 02:14:54,933
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what I'm reading.

1905
02:14:54,973 --> 02:14:57,935
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm reading Raven, Mona, Raven, Mona, Raven, Mona.

1906
02:15:01,176 --> 02:15:02,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Raven, Mona, cock.

1907
02:15:02,096 --> 02:15:02,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Raven, Mona, cock.

1908
02:15:02,577 --> 02:15:03,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight's cage match.

1909
02:15:05,018 --> 02:15:06,278
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a raving, moaning cock.

1910
02:15:06,298 --> 02:15:07,679
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's a cock rocket.

1911
02:15:12,805 --> 02:15:17,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Only on Orange Lounge Radio do you get the waving, moaning cock rocket here on the cage match.

1912
02:15:21,567 --> 02:15:24,408
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you want to know what's funny about Asian porn?

1913
02:15:24,588 --> 02:15:24,768
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1914
02:15:24,948 --> 02:15:26,488
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like Legos having sex.

1915
02:15:27,528 --> 02:15:28,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do you say that?

1916
02:15:28,188 --> 02:15:30,429
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to explain that for those who may not have seen Asian porn.

1917
02:15:30,449 --> 02:15:35,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's all blocked out and stuff because they're Japanese laws.

1918
02:15:35,210 --> 02:15:37,410
[SPEAKER_06]: No private parts can be shown.

1919
02:15:37,831 --> 02:15:39,811
[SPEAKER_06]: So it just looks like a bunch of Legos having sex.

1920
02:15:47,313 --> 02:15:49,015
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Aztec sex, baby.

1921
02:15:49,475 --> 02:15:49,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.

1922
02:15:50,296 --> 02:15:50,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Go Mosaic.

1923
02:15:57,355 --> 02:15:57,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1924
02:16:22,780 --> 02:16:23,841
[SPEAKER_13]: Great Dead Airspace here.

1925
02:16:24,701 --> 02:16:29,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I'm starting to tally up some of the votes here.

1926
02:16:29,422 --> 02:16:32,203
[SPEAKER_13]: No, you guys missed the philosophical message of the day.

1927
02:16:34,523 --> 02:16:38,425
[SPEAKER_13]: Life is a sexually transmitted fatal disease that's also hereditary.

1928
02:16:39,205 --> 02:16:42,746
[SPEAKER_20]: After your mom gave blowjobs at a truck stop.

1929
02:16:43,586 --> 02:16:46,287
[SPEAKER_06]: I said after your mom gave blowjobs at a truck stop.

1930
02:16:47,467 --> 02:16:50,548
[SPEAKER_13]: He downloaded the mall blowjobs.

1931
02:16:53,658 --> 02:16:56,180
[SPEAKER_07]: It was, it was like, uh, street blowjobs.

1932
02:16:56,200 --> 02:17:03,186
[SPEAKER_07]: It's this guy with this camera and his glasses and he convinces some girl to give him a blowjob, supposedly.

1933
02:17:05,908 --> 02:17:08,770
[SPEAKER_07]: I, well, shh, you, you lie.

1934
02:17:09,591 --> 02:17:10,592
[SPEAKER_07]: You're, you're saying it's all set.

1935
02:17:10,772 --> 02:17:13,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Next thing you're probably saying is, wrestling's fake.

1936
02:17:13,114 --> 02:17:15,576
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.

1937
02:17:18,396 --> 02:17:19,757
[SPEAKER_03]: The Amazing Flying Microphone.

1938
02:17:19,877 --> 02:17:20,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Bad catch.

1939
02:17:21,298 --> 02:17:22,458
[SPEAKER_03]: No, wrestling is not fake.

1940
02:17:22,538 --> 02:17:23,039
[SPEAKER_03]: It's real.

1941
02:17:23,299 --> 02:17:23,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Real fake.

1942
02:17:26,360 --> 02:17:27,041
[SPEAKER_03]: You funny.

1943
02:17:29,082 --> 02:17:29,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Boo!

1944
02:17:29,382 --> 02:17:32,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like Drew is going to go off the turnbuckle with the elbow there.

1945
02:17:33,584 --> 02:17:34,865
[SPEAKER_03]: She's slapping her elbow.

1946
02:17:36,926 --> 02:17:40,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, last call for votes in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

1947
02:17:40,088 --> 02:17:41,769
[SPEAKER_05]: In the meantime, let's take a quick break.

1948
02:17:42,149 --> 02:17:42,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Vote, bitches.

1949
02:17:43,149 --> 02:17:44,550
[SPEAKER_05]: And what do we want to do when we come back from the break?

1950
02:17:44,810 --> 02:17:45,110
[SPEAKER_13]: Polka.

1951
02:17:45,731 --> 02:17:46,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Polka?

1952
02:17:49,022 --> 02:17:53,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, yeah, we're going to do that topic about Mamani artists and soundtracks and movies they should have done.

1953
02:17:53,524 --> 02:17:56,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Nah, it's too weird to be a list list, but we could do a list list.

1954
02:17:57,425 --> 02:17:59,126
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, I'm too lazy to get papers, so we'll just talk.

1955
02:18:03,407 --> 02:18:04,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, fine.

1956
02:18:05,768 --> 02:18:07,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, last call for Cage Match, folks.

1957
02:18:09,574 --> 02:18:10,095
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll play it later.

1958
02:18:11,075 --> 02:18:11,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1959
02:18:12,857 --> 02:18:18,401
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back after this quick break featuring... Oh, I don't know.

1960
02:18:19,322 --> 02:18:20,843
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of song should I play here?

1961
02:18:21,163 --> 02:18:23,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, let's do something.

1962
02:18:23,165 --> 02:18:24,566
[SPEAKER_05]: I should do something from EX3.

1963
02:18:25,607 --> 02:18:28,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Dance Mania EX3 was out a couple weeks ago and I got a copy of it.

1964
02:18:28,509 --> 02:18:28,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1965
02:18:30,971 --> 02:18:31,912
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll play...

1966
02:18:34,386 --> 02:18:35,587
[SPEAKER_05]: The songs on it are kind of weird.

1967
02:18:36,007 --> 02:18:39,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want Smile DK or do you want the band that did I Do What Do I Do?

1968
02:18:40,071 --> 02:18:40,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Help I'm a Fish.

1969
02:18:41,492 --> 02:18:42,173
[SPEAKER_13]: Help I'm a Fish.

1970
02:18:44,494 --> 02:18:45,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do Help I'm a Fish.

1971
02:18:45,535 --> 02:18:46,336
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the song I like more.

1972
02:18:47,017 --> 02:18:48,878
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Creamy with Help I'm a Fish.

1973
02:18:48,978 --> 02:18:52,181
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a brand new Dance Mania EX3 song and we'll be back in a little bit.

1974
02:20:55,229 --> 02:20:56,291
Thanks for watching!

1975
02:23:08,536 --> 02:23:09,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, that was 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 7.

1976
02:23:10,677 --> 02:23:12,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Before that, help, I'm a fish by Creamy.

1977
02:23:12,579 --> 02:23:16,643
[SPEAKER_05]: And really fast, we're still in the middle of a break here, but Irene, would you share your bean burrito theory?

1978
02:23:21,563 --> 02:23:39,538
[SPEAKER_10]: I came up with the bean burrito theory a couple years ago when I heard that song, the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, because artists, some artists on DDR, they just pull random themes or just random words and put them together in a song, and it just sounds stupid.

1979
02:23:39,819 --> 02:23:44,402
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you know, and the reason I came up with bean burrito is just like, oh, you know, hey, I'm hungry.

1980
02:23:44,703 --> 02:23:48,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, bean burrito, la, la, la, la, it's just like, it's stupid, yeah.

1981
02:23:48,366 --> 02:23:48,626
[SPEAKER_10]: It's stupid.

1982
02:23:49,246 --> 02:23:55,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Bean burrito, guacamole, sour cream, and extra cheese.

1983
02:23:56,568 --> 02:23:58,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't thought up any other lyrics yet.

1984
02:23:58,128 --> 02:23:58,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's put that in GDR.

1985
02:23:58,888 --> 02:23:58,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

1986
02:24:01,029 --> 02:24:01,969
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Mexican version.

1987
02:24:02,169 --> 02:24:03,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you sing that one more time?

1988
02:24:04,410 --> 02:24:10,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Bean burrito, guacamole, sour cream, and extra cheese.

1989
02:24:11,111 --> 02:24:14,012
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna punch you, Rob, you're a dork.

1990
02:24:15,461 --> 02:24:18,542
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted an extra clean copy of that for any remixes we might plan.

1991
02:24:18,602 --> 02:24:18,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1992
02:24:19,202 --> 02:24:19,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're welcome.

1993
02:24:20,222 --> 02:24:22,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, let's look at Crash here.

1994
02:24:23,222 --> 02:24:24,383
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna go my way.

1995
02:24:24,483 --> 02:24:25,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Come with me, you mothers.

1996
02:24:26,303 --> 02:24:26,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go.

1997
02:24:28,583 --> 02:24:30,644
[SPEAKER_07]: One, two, three, four, five.

1998
02:24:30,704 --> 02:24:32,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Break the doll and get out of here.

1999
02:24:32,164 --> 02:24:32,904
[SPEAKER_07]: Come with me now.

2000
02:24:33,024 --> 02:24:34,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we're all going our way.

2001
02:24:34,765 --> 02:24:35,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Makes no sense.

2002
02:24:35,545 --> 02:24:41,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to show you, baby, the world that you've never seen because it can happen now.

2003
02:24:41,826 --> 02:24:42,866
[SPEAKER_07]: So hold you tight, babe.

2004
02:24:43,393 --> 02:24:46,114
[SPEAKER_13]: Just pick any Eurobeat song.

2005
02:24:46,655 --> 02:24:48,215
[SPEAKER_13]: Any Eurobeat song.

2006
02:24:51,157 --> 02:24:52,798
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to know what they say.

2007
02:24:52,958 --> 02:24:54,138
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, I don't care.

2008
02:24:54,278 --> 02:24:55,619
[SPEAKER_07]: They can tell me nothing.

2009
02:24:55,919 --> 02:24:56,800
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go my way.

2010
02:24:56,840 --> 02:24:58,941
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not doing it right.

2011
02:24:58,961 --> 02:25:00,301
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to know.

2012
02:25:00,441 --> 02:25:01,402
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like Mr. Spanky singing.

2013
02:25:01,862 --> 02:25:07,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, I don't want my voice being made into some sort of DWI, so obviously I'm not going to do it with any rhythm.

2014
02:25:08,265 --> 02:25:09,646
[SPEAKER_07]: We really don't need to hear it all now.

2015
02:25:12,076 --> 02:25:13,217
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, we're still in break time.

2016
02:25:13,257 --> 02:25:14,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Go on and fall apart.

2017
02:25:14,658 --> 02:25:15,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go.

2018
02:25:15,498 --> 02:25:15,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah.

2019
02:25:16,699 --> 02:25:16,819
[SPEAKER_13]: Ah.

2020
02:25:17,219 --> 02:25:17,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah.

2021
02:25:17,440 --> 02:25:17,720
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2022
02:25:17,780 --> 02:25:18,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to break.

2023
02:25:19,201 --> 02:25:20,061
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to play this.

2024
02:25:20,081 --> 02:25:22,503
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something that Justin's working on.

2025
02:25:22,543 --> 02:25:23,504
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a world premiere.

2026
02:25:23,604 --> 02:25:24,644
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an original piece.

2027
02:25:25,565 --> 02:25:27,546
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's even calling himself different names now, too.

2028
02:25:27,586 --> 02:25:28,187
[SPEAKER_05]: This is pretty funny.

2029
02:25:28,227 --> 02:25:29,628
[SPEAKER_05]: He's calling himself Hyper Orchestra.

2030
02:25:30,108 --> 02:25:34,150
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is Hyper Orchestra with Musette in D. This is a little sample.

2031
02:25:34,411 --> 02:25:35,431
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a work in progress.

2032
02:25:35,832 --> 02:25:38,974
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after that, we're going to hear a request that Jamie wants you all to hear.

2033
02:25:39,434 --> 02:25:40,835
[SPEAKER_05]: So we shall do that.

2034
02:25:40,855 --> 02:25:40,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2035
02:26:54,731 --> 02:26:56,432
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for watching!

2036
02:27:47,167 --> 02:27:48,544
[SPEAKER_20]: Just to be with you tonight

2037
02:28:06,314 --> 02:28:14,859
[SPEAKER_12]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

2038
02:28:14,899 --> 02:28:20,922
[SPEAKER_20]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

2039
02:28:21,302 --> 02:28:26,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, we're back, and Jamie, what did you think of that Hyper Orchestra Musette in D piece?

2040
02:28:26,886 --> 02:28:28,146
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool, but it needs a little bit more work.

2041
02:28:28,406 --> 02:28:28,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it needs to be longer.

2042
02:28:28,967 --> 02:28:29,567
[SPEAKER_13]: It needs more going on.

2043
02:28:29,707 --> 02:28:30,107
[SPEAKER_05]: More going on.

2044
02:28:30,267 --> 02:28:30,908
[SPEAKER_13]: And a different rhythm.

2045
02:28:31,328 --> 02:28:32,329
[SPEAKER_13]: A different drum beat.

2046
02:28:33,309 --> 02:28:34,550
[SPEAKER_05]: But does it make you want to kill people?

2047
02:28:35,583 --> 02:28:36,183
[SPEAKER_13]: Eventually it will.

2048
02:28:37,684 --> 02:28:38,545
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes me want to kill people.

2049
02:28:39,005 --> 02:28:39,925
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's at that level for me.

2050
02:28:42,007 --> 02:28:42,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you're right.

2051
02:28:42,487 --> 02:28:43,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to kill people, Irene.

2052
02:28:44,008 --> 02:28:45,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Zero.

2053
02:28:45,609 --> 02:28:45,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?

2054
02:28:46,049 --> 02:28:47,330
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you said... I just said death.

2055
02:28:47,610 --> 02:28:48,270
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyways, death.

2056
02:28:50,732 --> 02:28:51,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Burritos.

2057
02:28:52,933 --> 02:28:53,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Chicken.

2058
02:28:54,193 --> 02:28:58,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so while they play... Nachos.

2059
02:28:58,976 --> 02:29:03,919
[SPEAKER_05]: ...vinyl over there, the winner of tonight's cage match, by the way, can we get a big drumroll?

2060
02:29:06,649 --> 02:29:10,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, the winner is Mona Lisa Overdrive won the cage match.

2061
02:29:10,332 --> 02:29:10,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

2062
02:29:10,912 --> 02:29:11,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.

2063
02:29:11,613 --> 02:29:13,575
[SPEAKER_05]: So now you can use that next week, Jamie.

2064
02:29:15,276 --> 02:29:21,541
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is the first week I can remember in a long, long time where every song did get at least one vote.

2065
02:29:22,022 --> 02:29:25,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually my picks don't even get a vote, but tonight every song at least got one vote.

2066
02:29:26,526 --> 02:29:27,667
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Raven-Symoné.

2067
02:29:27,907 --> 02:29:28,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone's a winner.

2068
02:29:29,188 --> 02:29:30,109
[SPEAKER_05]: At least two votes no.

2069
02:29:32,409 --> 02:29:33,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody loves a seven-year-old.

2070
02:29:33,891 --> 02:29:36,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Raven-Symoné was not lucky enough to get two votes tonight.

2071
02:29:38,675 --> 02:29:40,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop putting on Raven-Symoné.

2072
02:29:40,117 --> 02:29:40,717
[SPEAKER_03]: She sucks.

2073
02:29:40,777 --> 02:29:41,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Sucks!

2074
02:29:42,119 --> 02:29:43,480
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't vote her as the winner last week.

2075
02:29:45,462 --> 02:29:47,244
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys voted her as the winner?

2076
02:29:47,804 --> 02:29:48,545
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm dismayed.

2077
02:29:49,686 --> 02:29:50,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Our listeners suck.

2078
02:29:51,628 --> 02:29:52,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are you dismayed?

2079
02:29:52,989 --> 02:29:54,231
[SPEAKER_13]: Because Rocket owns you.

2080
02:29:55,367 --> 02:29:56,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Rocket owns.

2081
02:29:56,268 --> 02:30:00,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Rocket does own and it did get a good reaction but unfortunately you just got beat by the Matrix like everything else.

2082
02:30:01,992 --> 02:30:02,913
[SPEAKER_13]: Poopy on the Matrix.

2083
02:30:03,113 --> 02:30:04,334
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't believe in the Matrix.

2084
02:30:05,795 --> 02:30:08,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Watch me bend this spoon with the power of my mind.

2085
02:30:10,779 --> 02:30:11,800
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll hack the world!

2086
02:30:21,363 --> 02:30:23,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, sir.

2087
02:30:25,346 --> 02:30:27,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, more topics.

2088
02:30:27,127 --> 02:30:32,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Like promised earlier, we wanted to talk about movies that Bomani artists should do soundtracks to.

2089
02:30:32,531 --> 02:30:37,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, this could be like upcoming sequels or just like ideas for films or movies in the past that would have been cooler.

2090
02:30:37,855 --> 02:30:38,776
[SPEAKER_13]: X-Men movie, Tack.

2091
02:30:39,456 --> 02:30:40,777
[SPEAKER_05]: X-Men movie with a Tack soundtrack?

2092
02:30:40,957 --> 02:30:41,838
[SPEAKER_13]: Matrix with Tack.

2093
02:30:42,298 --> 02:30:43,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Matrix with Tack?

2094
02:30:43,539 --> 02:30:45,020
[SPEAKER_13]: Babes in Toyland featuring Tack.

2095
02:30:45,361 --> 02:30:47,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any movie you wouldn't want to see Tack doing the soundtrack to?

2096
02:30:50,404 --> 02:30:51,125
[SPEAKER_13]: Seki movies.

2097
02:30:53,246 --> 02:30:54,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Loki.

2098
02:30:57,108 --> 02:30:58,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Glitter 2 featuring Paul Terry.

2099
02:31:03,331 --> 02:31:04,272
[SPEAKER_13]: That was cute.

2100
02:31:04,312 --> 02:31:05,533
[SPEAKER_13]: He did a little happy hop.

2101
02:31:06,673 --> 02:31:07,794
[SPEAKER_05]: He did a little happy hopper.

2102
02:31:08,454 --> 02:31:15,158
[SPEAKER_05]: How about Orange Lounge, the band, doing a soundtrack to a porno?

2103
02:31:18,369 --> 02:31:19,029
[SPEAKER_04]: French porno.

2104
02:31:23,730 --> 02:31:24,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop it.

2105
02:31:25,371 --> 02:31:26,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Joker over there.

2106
02:31:26,851 --> 02:31:28,171
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be funny and you know it.

2107
02:31:30,332 --> 02:31:33,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I could see Taka doing like a really epic kind of film.

2108
02:31:34,113 --> 02:31:34,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Taka?

2109
02:31:34,853 --> 02:31:35,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Doing like an epic film.

2110
02:31:35,613 --> 02:31:37,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking more like a Samba Kubota.

2111
02:31:38,213 --> 02:31:39,634
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be cool.

2112
02:31:39,794 --> 02:31:41,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Zero says a gothic porno.

2113
02:31:42,454 --> 02:31:44,355
[SPEAKER_13]: Kubota doing RPG music.

2114
02:31:44,375 --> 02:31:45,155
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2115
02:31:47,754 --> 02:32:01,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if anybody in the listening knows this for a fact, but, you know, since it is Konami, Metal Gear Solid, I don't know, maybe, but Red Nikita does remind me of Metal Gear Solid, kind of, so, maybe that he actually had some actual production in the music of Metal Gear Solid of some way.

2116
02:32:03,667 --> 02:32:13,715
[SPEAKER_13]: One thing, um, for my Metal Gear Solid CD that I have, there's the, um, theme song remix by Quadra on the end, and, you know, Quadra did 5-key stuff.

2117
02:32:13,755 --> 02:32:13,995
[SPEAKER_13]: Mm-hmm.

2118
02:32:16,323 --> 02:32:21,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, for probably one of the most horrible sequels ever, if they want to make it redeeming, they should have good music.

2119
02:32:22,005 --> 02:32:32,989
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be cool to see, like, um, Tack and Taka doing, um, some good music for the horrible-ass Street Fighter, uh, sequel that's gonna be coming out.

2120
02:32:33,549 --> 02:32:34,830
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's pretty bad.

2121
02:32:34,870 --> 02:32:35,710
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't hear about that?

2122
02:32:36,738 --> 02:32:37,238
[SPEAKER_06]: The Movie.

2123
02:32:37,718 --> 02:32:40,279
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember the crappy ass Van Damme?

2124
02:32:40,680 --> 02:32:41,660
[SPEAKER_06]: They're doing a sequel!

2125
02:32:41,980 --> 02:32:42,860
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, he is back in it.

2126
02:32:42,880 --> 02:32:43,341
[SPEAKER_04]: That is awesome.

2127
02:32:44,181 --> 02:32:45,982
[SPEAKER_06]: So they might as well... I would go see that.

2128
02:32:46,022 --> 02:32:49,403
[SPEAKER_06]: They might as well dig, of course, the Bane bad guy is supposed to be a Kona.

2129
02:32:49,523 --> 02:32:50,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Kylie Minogue gonna be back in it?

2130
02:32:50,924 --> 02:32:51,304
[SPEAKER_06]: I would.

2131
02:32:51,324 --> 02:32:52,044
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be the best.

2132
02:32:52,164 --> 02:32:52,884
[SPEAKER_06]: She better be.

2133
02:32:53,024 --> 02:32:53,925
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be the only reason.

2134
02:32:54,225 --> 02:32:55,265
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, she has a career now.

2135
02:32:55,365 --> 02:32:56,026
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm the green fairy!

2136
02:32:57,786 --> 02:32:57,966
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

2137
02:33:00,087 --> 02:33:00,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Break in three.

2138
02:33:02,688 --> 02:33:03,688
[SPEAKER_13]: Featuring good cool.

2139
02:33:03,749 --> 02:33:04,689
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awesome.

2140
02:33:07,136 --> 02:33:08,718
[SPEAKER_13]: What's this in the VCR right now?

2141
02:33:09,178 --> 02:33:14,284
[SPEAKER_13]: We're watching, we've been... Okay, the only breakin' movie I'd ever seen was the sequel, Breakin' 2, Electric Boogaloo.

2142
02:33:15,104 --> 02:33:15,685
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it breakdancing?

2143
02:33:16,025 --> 02:33:17,127
[SPEAKER_13]: Breakdancing, it's like done in 82, 83.

2144
02:33:17,187 --> 02:33:17,587
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.

2145
02:33:17,607 --> 02:33:18,488
[SPEAKER_13]: I like that.

2146
02:33:21,051 --> 02:33:21,631
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that.

2147
02:33:21,691 --> 02:33:22,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a cute joke.

2148
02:33:23,694 --> 02:33:24,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a cute joke.

2149
02:33:24,374 --> 02:33:28,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Terminator 2DX, this is from the chatroom, Terminator 2DX with Tran as Terminator.

2150
02:33:29,865 --> 02:33:36,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, but if you've ever heard... Have you ever seen the Terminator movie, guys?

2151
02:33:36,111 --> 02:33:36,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the music is like...

2152
02:33:41,966 --> 02:33:43,387
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a bunch of weird sound effects.

2153
02:33:43,427 --> 02:33:48,070
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the guy pressed on his keyboard a couple times and said, Here, this is a soundtrack.

2154
02:33:48,130 --> 02:33:53,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you ever seen the Mr. Science Theater 3000 version of Pod People?

2155
02:33:53,714 --> 02:33:56,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Where they're doing their New Age music?

2156
02:33:56,776 --> 02:34:00,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Now put your finger on this key.

2157
02:34:01,339 --> 02:34:02,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you're playing New Age key.

2158
02:34:03,281 --> 02:34:04,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Now put two fingers on there.

2159
02:34:04,682 --> 02:34:05,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you're playing New Age chord.

2160
02:34:05,722 --> 02:34:06,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Now hold it down.

2161
02:34:07,043 --> 02:34:21,782
[SPEAKER_05]: until you get a record label and hold it down it was hilarious back to the soundtracks idea I'm thinking of a scary movie let's say The Ring 2 because you know they're going to do a sequel to The Ring based on one of the Japanese movies

2162
02:34:22,662 --> 02:34:23,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Ringu too.

2163
02:34:24,063 --> 02:34:26,384
[SPEAKER_05]: How about Akira Yamaoka doing the soundtrack?

2164
02:34:26,984 --> 02:34:29,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, he did the soundtracks for Silent Hill.

2165
02:34:29,125 --> 02:34:31,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the creepiest games ever.

2166
02:34:32,146 --> 02:34:33,227
[SPEAKER_05]: I went on a road trip once.

2167
02:34:33,347 --> 02:34:37,949
[SPEAKER_05]: My friend Garrett drove me out to these roads that are not lit very well.

2168
02:34:37,969 --> 02:34:39,009
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like a scary place.

2169
02:34:39,509 --> 02:34:43,571
[SPEAKER_05]: There's all these trees and railroad tracks that look all abandoned and stuff.

2170
02:34:44,111 --> 02:34:46,173
[SPEAKER_05]: And we played Silent Hill while driving through there.

2171
02:34:46,193 --> 02:34:46,633
[SPEAKER_05]: It was scary.

2172
02:34:46,673 --> 02:34:47,093
[SPEAKER_05]: The music?

2173
02:34:47,113 --> 02:34:47,654
[SPEAKER_05]: The soundtrack?

2174
02:34:47,814 --> 02:34:48,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2175
02:34:48,214 --> 02:34:48,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.

2176
02:34:48,754 --> 02:34:49,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's really messed up.

2177
02:34:49,835 --> 02:34:52,157
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd never really heard Silent Hill music before because I'd never played the game.

2178
02:34:52,177 --> 02:34:54,338
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of sounds like Portishead.

2179
02:34:54,358 --> 02:34:55,779
[SPEAKER_05]: I was really surprised.

2180
02:34:56,099 --> 02:34:58,881
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't sound like anything Kiriyama has done in 2DX.

2181
02:34:59,342 --> 02:34:59,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

2182
02:34:59,762 --> 02:35:00,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really.

2183
02:35:00,542 --> 02:35:04,125
[SPEAKER_10]: The theme of Silent Hill sounds like Sour Time.

2184
02:35:04,405 --> 02:35:05,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the Portishead song.

2185
02:35:05,926 --> 02:35:08,788
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got that guitar or ukulele or whatever they're doing.

2186
02:35:09,248 --> 02:35:11,350
[SPEAKER_03]: The me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me-me.

2187
02:35:13,436 --> 02:35:13,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Mandolin?

2188
02:35:14,877 --> 02:35:15,457
[SPEAKER_03]: A mandolin?

2189
02:35:22,703 --> 02:35:25,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, we love dead air here at Orange Lounge.

2190
02:35:25,605 --> 02:35:27,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I've been reading private messages.

2191
02:35:27,146 --> 02:35:28,086
[SPEAKER_13]: He was killing a bug with Asian porn.

2192
02:35:28,106 --> 02:35:30,588
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a really funny one I'll have to share with you guys off air.

2193
02:35:32,469 --> 02:35:34,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Insect Zero, Asian Porn One.

2194
02:35:39,014 --> 02:35:41,716
[SPEAKER_05]: The shape and boob chick killed the bug.

2195
02:35:41,936 --> 02:35:42,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other soundtrack ideas?

2196
02:35:45,492 --> 02:35:50,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we can have True Kiss Destination doing... The Hulk 2.

2197
02:35:56,478 --> 02:35:57,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I got it this time.

2198
02:35:57,278 --> 02:35:57,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I caught the mic.

2199
02:35:58,519 --> 02:35:59,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Irene has one.

2200
02:36:00,179 --> 02:36:01,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Duval doing Disney?

2201
02:36:03,761 --> 02:36:04,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what Disney movie?

2202
02:36:06,564 --> 02:36:07,244
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2203
02:36:12,166 --> 02:36:16,207
[SPEAKER_05]: As the chat room suggested during Help, I'm a Fish, that should be in Finding Nemo, the new movie coming out.

2204
02:36:16,807 --> 02:36:17,367
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

2205
02:36:17,827 --> 02:36:18,047
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

2206
02:36:19,768 --> 02:36:22,269
[SPEAKER_13]: Enemy Zero featuring Desro.

2207
02:36:24,449 --> 02:36:26,930
[SPEAKER_13]: The movie that you made me watch with the aliens.

2208
02:36:28,752 --> 02:36:31,094
[SPEAKER_13]: Wild Zero, yeah, featuring Desro.

2209
02:36:31,354 --> 02:36:33,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Any trauma film featuring Desro.

2210
02:36:33,756 --> 02:36:36,399
[SPEAKER_13]: No, the Guitar Wolf.

2211
02:36:36,919 --> 02:36:37,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge.

2212
02:36:37,720 --> 02:36:40,242
[SPEAKER_13]: Guitar Wolf and Guitar Freaks.

2213
02:36:42,844 --> 02:36:45,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge should do the soundtrack to the next John Waters movie.

2214
02:36:57,068 --> 02:36:58,489
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I killed the station.

2215
02:36:58,689 --> 02:36:59,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's see here.

2216
02:36:59,749 --> 02:37:09,774
[SPEAKER_07]: We could have the next American Pie movie with Mr. Brian in the final van.

2217
02:37:10,895 --> 02:37:12,455
[SPEAKER_05]: There is an American Pie movie coming out.

2218
02:37:12,476 --> 02:37:13,276
[SPEAKER_07]: American Wedding, I know.

2219
02:37:14,416 --> 02:37:14,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

2220
02:37:14,637 --> 02:37:15,297
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the last one.

2221
02:37:17,638 --> 02:37:18,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2222
02:37:20,019 --> 02:37:20,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

2223
02:37:22,100 --> 02:37:23,981
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a movie called 4-2-K that you need to watch.

2224
02:37:24,021 --> 02:37:25,562
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hilarious in parts.

2225
02:37:28,160 --> 02:37:29,380
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got punk music in it.

2226
02:37:33,882 --> 02:37:35,322
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's funny.

2227
02:37:35,423 --> 02:37:48,207
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to do with these zombies attacking, they're like these zombies attacking this house and then they get these like renta ninjas that come over and then, and there's like, no, there's these four alien chicks that are, it's weird.

2228
02:37:48,767 --> 02:37:50,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me find the tape, it's hilarious.

2229
02:37:51,708 --> 02:37:56,810
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, Rob, weren't you the one who was telling me about them actually doing a true sequel to the Rocky Horror Picture Show?

2230
02:37:59,312 --> 02:38:02,774
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a rumor that comes up every now and then.

2231
02:38:02,794 --> 02:38:05,175
[SPEAKER_13]: If they did that one, have the music by Orange Lounge.

2232
02:38:05,696 --> 02:38:07,997
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be cool, except you know the problem with that?

2233
02:38:08,077 --> 02:38:09,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Richard O'Brien has to do it.

2234
02:38:09,318 --> 02:38:12,679
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so that he should contract Orange Lounge.

2235
02:38:13,060 --> 02:38:14,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Orange Lounge can make a contribution.

2236
02:38:14,560 --> 02:38:16,982
[SPEAKER_13]: And he writes the lyrics, but they're not all in French.

2237
02:38:19,730 --> 02:38:23,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he gets some help from Rina Gumo to do something like Secret Tale.

2238
02:38:24,773 --> 02:38:25,674
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really bad.

2239
02:38:25,794 --> 02:38:26,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

2240
02:38:26,774 --> 02:38:29,596
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but in all honesty, I think LED should do something in a music industry.

2241
02:38:29,636 --> 02:38:29,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2242
02:38:30,097 --> 02:38:32,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a Matrix-type movie, you know, a lot of action.

2243
02:38:33,018 --> 02:38:39,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Because some of his really, you know, like The Outer Limits, that song, something like that, breakbeats.

2244
02:38:40,723 --> 02:38:41,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a question for you guys.

2245
02:38:42,105 --> 02:38:45,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe this has been brought up on the show before, but I actually don't think it ever has, which is surprising.

2246
02:38:45,870 --> 02:38:52,078
[SPEAKER_05]: If a Bomani artist, any Bomani artist, were to release a CD here in the US, which one should do it and why?

2247
02:38:52,138 --> 02:38:53,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Who would have the best chances of success?

2248
02:38:55,416 --> 02:38:57,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Jamie says tack, and Sheila says that.

2249
02:38:58,538 --> 02:38:58,919
[SPEAKER_03]: She says.

2250
02:38:59,319 --> 02:39:01,100
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I only said that because she's just said that.

2251
02:39:01,300 --> 02:39:03,542
[SPEAKER_03]: And, go ahead, Matt, Loki.

2252
02:39:03,802 --> 02:39:09,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, obviously, it's gotta be, um, I believe, isn't Last Message the good cool featuring Meg?

2253
02:39:09,906 --> 02:39:11,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then it'd have to be Meg, because she has a nice rack.

2254
02:39:12,330 --> 02:39:15,831
[SPEAKER_13]: One thing, actually, Fantastic Plastic Machine does have a CD in the U.S.

2255
02:39:16,751 --> 02:39:17,151
[SPEAKER_13]: I have it.

2256
02:39:17,551 --> 02:39:27,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Outside of ones that already do have one, and maybe like the one, two, like outside of Dance Mania artists, let's say, because Dance Mania artists already have CDs, most of them, let's say like Actual Bomani.

2257
02:39:27,654 --> 02:39:29,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Actual Bomani, you know, sounds sad.

2258
02:39:29,834 --> 02:39:30,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Konami sounds sad.

2259
02:39:30,755 --> 02:39:31,495
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we could say.

2260
02:39:33,635 --> 02:39:37,856
[SPEAKER_03]: In all honesty, from the, yeah, Jamie and Matt both say good, cool.

2261
02:39:38,937 --> 02:39:39,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Ryo Nagumi.

2262
02:39:40,698 --> 02:39:43,142
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree, I think Good Cool would have the most chance of success.

2263
02:39:43,542 --> 02:39:47,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually though, it's funny you mention it, I think one person that would have a really kick-ass CD, LED.

2264
02:39:47,709 --> 02:39:51,655
[SPEAKER_05]: And I say that because he has so many different styles, like something wonderful...

2265
02:39:55,403 --> 02:39:59,465
[SPEAKER_05]: I have something to say.

2266
02:39:59,606 --> 02:39:59,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

2267
02:40:00,386 --> 02:40:10,392
[SPEAKER_03]: All the staple artists in the Konami sound staff who are making music for Bomani Games, Taka, Tak,

2268
02:40:11,232 --> 02:40:13,935
[SPEAKER_03]: LED, Naoki, Good Cool.

2269
02:40:15,476 --> 02:40:17,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm probably repeating names because they use the same names all the time.

2270
02:40:17,658 --> 02:40:27,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, they all have a chance releasing and selling good music because they all have good resumes as far as music they've written, so it's really hard to choose which one.

2271
02:40:27,486 --> 02:40:34,813
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Akira Yamaoka, he's made music and games that are very popular in America, so it's hard to say.

2272
02:40:34,833 --> 02:40:35,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Soda.

2273
02:40:35,874 --> 02:40:36,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Soda.

2274
02:40:39,954 --> 02:40:40,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2275
02:40:42,516 --> 02:40:44,597
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be okay.

2276
02:40:44,657 --> 02:40:45,057
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2277
02:40:47,018 --> 02:40:49,019
[SPEAKER_05]: He'd have to show a little more diversity before I could say that.

2278
02:40:49,059 --> 02:40:54,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's why I think... That stuff would be picked up by DJs like... Yeah.

2279
02:40:54,563 --> 02:40:57,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Because all trance music is pretty much the same anyways.

2280
02:40:57,904 --> 02:40:59,685
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just all synth with a backbeat.

2281
02:40:59,705 --> 02:41:00,066
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

2282
02:41:01,078 --> 02:41:03,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm surprised with the popularity of DDR.

2283
02:41:03,179 --> 02:41:11,283
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not hearing such cultish songs from DDR that are mega popular like Look to the Sky on some dance radio station at night.

2284
02:41:11,863 --> 02:41:14,484
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because we're in Sacramento, we don't have cool stations like that.

2285
02:41:14,824 --> 02:41:16,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Ours got kicked off the air, remember?

2286
02:41:16,345 --> 02:41:19,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's actually one kind of weird thing.

2287
02:41:19,226 --> 02:41:23,648
[SPEAKER_06]: One night I was actually coming back from CCL, just getting done playing DDR, and

2288
02:41:23,928 --> 02:41:29,170
[SPEAKER_06]: I was listening to Quad, you know, on Saturdays or whatever, they play that, like, all that trancy stuff.

2289
02:41:29,510 --> 02:41:32,511
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually did hear Holic, and I actually did play it.

2290
02:41:33,371 --> 02:41:39,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it was, because we sat there and debated it for like an hour and a half, and it actually was Holic, which, I don't know how it got played.

2291
02:41:39,733 --> 02:41:42,554
[SPEAKER_06]: But, so, someone may have said it or something.

2292
02:41:42,574 --> 02:41:45,115
[SPEAKER_13]: We were in Brookfields and heard Stump to My Beat playing out of the kitchen.

2293
02:41:45,555 --> 02:41:47,556
[SPEAKER_13]: Stump to My Beat, yeah, Stump to My Beat.

2294
02:41:47,616 --> 02:41:49,437
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, but that was the thing, I thought that was funny.

2295
02:41:49,877 --> 02:41:51,577
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Scotty D should have some stuff.

2296
02:41:52,178 --> 02:41:52,478
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2297
02:41:53,278 --> 02:41:53,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2298
02:41:54,918 --> 02:41:55,878
[SPEAKER_13]: I forgot what I was going to say.

2299
02:41:56,058 --> 02:41:58,159
[SPEAKER_13]: They should contract Avex tracks again.

2300
02:41:59,339 --> 02:42:02,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they did with Parapara.

2301
02:42:03,381 --> 02:42:05,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do you think Konami doesn't release Bomani soundtracks in the US?

2302
02:42:06,061 --> 02:42:11,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Besides the fact that DDR USA, the arcade versions, wouldn't have had a good soundtrack.

2303
02:42:11,403 --> 02:42:12,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Why didn't they release one for Max USA?

2304
02:42:13,184 --> 02:42:14,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Besides the limited edition one.

2305
02:42:14,784 --> 02:42:19,705
[SPEAKER_03]: The only reason why, and the obvious reason why, they're not releasing these things is because there isn't obviously a market for it.

2306
02:42:20,585 --> 02:42:27,647
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're having to pressure them so much just to release the games, there's not a market enough for them to put in money to release the soundtracks.

2307
02:42:27,667 --> 02:42:29,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if there was, they would do it.

2308
02:42:29,147 --> 02:42:29,948
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what are they going to say?

2309
02:42:30,428 --> 02:42:34,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's an obvious money-making market here in America, but we're not going to release them because we hate Americans.

2310
02:42:34,469 --> 02:42:36,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really, they're going to release it if there's a market.

2311
02:42:37,069 --> 02:42:38,730
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no market, they're not going to release it.

2312
02:42:39,090 --> 02:42:43,591
[SPEAKER_05]: But over, like, almost, I think, about 25,000 registered users on DDR Freak...

2313
02:42:44,367 --> 02:42:47,863
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of soundtracks to real movies sell 5,000 at the most.

2314
02:42:50,899 --> 02:43:04,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, because usually what happens, they'll print mass amounts of the CDs because, you know, they do... I mean, you think actual artists like, you know, Britney Spears, millions of CDs get printed and millions of them get bought because that's just pop, you know?

2315
02:43:04,782 --> 02:43:11,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's why, because Konami's cheap and they don't want licensed music, and licensing music for a game is expensive enough, let alone soundtrack rights as well.

2316
02:43:11,283 --> 02:43:12,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you have to go through more red tape.

2317
02:43:12,403 --> 02:43:14,964
[SPEAKER_07]: And the fact, I mean, making the CDs themselves only costs pennies.

2318
02:43:15,244 --> 02:43:15,524
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean...

2319
02:43:16,204 --> 02:43:31,324
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just the whole licensing rights, and because over here in America, we're bastards, and we charge, or actually, the RIAA is bastards, and they charge up the ass for licensing rights, and copyright laws are crazy, and it's just a bad situation, that's why.

2320
02:43:32,751 --> 02:43:41,293
[SPEAKER_03]: All we're gonna hear is more, like, uh, more fucking covers of Welcome to the Jungle and shit by crazy people who don't sound anything like Axl Rose.

2321
02:43:41,353 --> 02:43:45,074
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not talking about trying to make, like, DDR music, like, mainstream.

2322
02:43:45,114 --> 02:43:49,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, oh, next on MTV, on Total Request Live, number 10, drop the bomb, yeah!

2323
02:43:49,855 --> 02:43:53,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not talking about that kind of thing, but just, like, trying to just at least put the music out there.

2324
02:43:53,555 --> 02:43:55,716
[SPEAKER_05]: If the music isn't out there, if you want the music, you have to go underground.

2325
02:43:55,776 --> 02:44:01,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, here's what I think... What I can debate why they don't do is maybe...

2326
02:44:02,915 --> 02:44:06,097
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing these releases on these home systems.

2327
02:44:06,177 --> 02:44:11,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe for once, maybe release a small sound CD with the game if you pre-order or something.

2328
02:44:12,261 --> 02:44:13,102
[SPEAKER_05]: They did that with Max.

2329
02:44:13,262 --> 02:44:14,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Toys R Us.

2330
02:44:14,463 --> 02:44:15,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie's got one.

2331
02:44:15,303 --> 02:44:17,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Toys R Us did that.

2332
02:44:18,205 --> 02:44:19,406
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the requirements, Jamie?

2333
02:44:19,426 --> 02:44:20,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember what you had to do to get that CD?

2334
02:44:20,846 --> 02:44:21,847
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I got mine from...

2335
02:44:23,567 --> 02:44:24,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you got yours donated.

2336
02:44:26,291 --> 02:44:26,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Quote, unquote.

2337
02:44:26,851 --> 02:44:28,273
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, mine's real.

2338
02:44:28,854 --> 02:44:31,317
[SPEAKER_13]: It was given to me as a tourney.

2339
02:44:31,717 --> 02:44:36,924
[SPEAKER_13]: I got a few of them that we gave out as prizes for tourney.

2340
02:44:37,264 --> 02:44:37,424
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

2341
02:44:37,464 --> 02:44:38,926
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember Toys R Us was doing something with those.

2342
02:44:38,966 --> 02:44:41,169
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if you pre-ordered at Toys R Us, you got that.

2343
02:44:41,249 --> 02:44:42,050
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's how it worked.

2344
02:44:42,907 --> 02:44:50,515
[SPEAKER_05]: But still, I mean, that's not like... I can walk into Dimple and see it in the soundtrack section, or... Dimple is... I'm sorry, because that's only in Sacramento.

2345
02:44:50,535 --> 02:44:51,136
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a record store.

2346
02:44:51,176 --> 02:44:56,982
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's say I can't walk into Virgin Megastore, and Virgin Megastore imports a lot of stuff.

2347
02:44:57,022 --> 02:44:59,164
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't import anything Japanese, which baffles me.

2348
02:45:00,446 --> 02:45:01,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Very limited, though.

2349
02:45:01,587 --> 02:45:02,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Very, very limited.

2350
02:45:02,308 --> 02:45:02,408
[SPEAKER_05]: It's...

2351
02:45:04,905 --> 02:45:08,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm talking like, I don't think you can find a Yumi Hamasaki even, right?

2352
02:45:09,128 --> 02:45:10,810
[SPEAKER_05]: You can even... Really?

2353
02:45:11,270 --> 02:45:12,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you order Dance Media albums through Virgin?

2354
02:45:15,293 --> 02:45:19,696
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been to the Virgin Megastore in San Francisco and I never see anything interesting Japanese-wise.

2355
02:45:21,398 --> 02:45:27,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Arden doesn't have anything as far as... You have to go to the world music section, it's like crap.

2356
02:45:27,322 --> 02:45:30,464
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing you're going to find tons of shit of is like UK stuff.

2357
02:45:30,484 --> 02:45:31,985
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to find tons of UK stuff.

2358
02:45:32,366 --> 02:45:33,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's really popular over here.

2359
02:45:34,770 --> 02:45:39,335
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's another artist that needs to come over to America, Yumi Hamasaki.

2360
02:45:39,935 --> 02:45:41,537
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, she would kick ass over here too.

2361
02:45:41,877 --> 02:45:42,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Just her music's awesome.

2362
02:45:42,698 --> 02:45:43,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I think definitely.

2363
02:45:44,540 --> 02:45:45,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, but here's the thing.

2364
02:45:46,062 --> 02:45:49,425
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of the thing with America in general and the history of music.

2365
02:45:49,485 --> 02:45:53,569
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like pop has always been popular and it's always been the main thing, you know.

2366
02:45:53,610 --> 02:45:55,391
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, we all hate pop, but...

2367
02:45:56,172 --> 02:45:56,592
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

2368
02:46:15,822 --> 02:46:23,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, we go through these phases, and we already went through our techno trance rave music phase in the mid-90s, and it's gone now.

2369
02:46:23,790 --> 02:46:24,851
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not popular.

2370
02:46:25,291 --> 02:46:28,755
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of people doing these things, but there's a lot of freaking people in America.

2371
02:46:29,035 --> 02:46:31,737
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot more people are listening to Britney Spears.

2372
02:46:31,918 --> 02:46:32,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

2373
02:46:32,919 --> 02:46:33,920
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always going to be that way.

2374
02:46:33,980 --> 02:46:35,701
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always going to be pop.

2375
02:46:35,881 --> 02:46:38,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Not always, because music rotates itself every...

2376
02:46:40,723 --> 02:46:43,124
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't say that long, probably about more like every four years.

2377
02:46:43,184 --> 02:46:44,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, then watch.

2378
02:46:44,765 --> 02:46:47,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Four to ten years from now, we're going to see some Bomani CDs printed, finally.

2379
02:46:48,406 --> 02:46:55,349
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to tell you, now this is going to be a really strange sounding theory, and I know I'm going to get boos for this, but I'll tell you why Britney Spears and all that's on their way out the door.

2380
02:46:56,069 --> 02:46:56,970
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is going to sound funny.

2381
02:46:56,990 --> 02:46:57,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they suck?

2382
02:46:58,542 --> 02:47:00,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the three people who are in the finals in American Idol right now.

2383
02:47:00,845 --> 02:47:02,507
[SPEAKER_05]: You have two overweight people and a dork.

2384
02:47:13,662 --> 02:47:14,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

2385
02:47:14,203 --> 02:47:16,104
[SPEAKER_05]: What does that show America wants right now?

2386
02:47:16,364 --> 02:47:20,267
[SPEAKER_05]: They are sick and tired of seeing the same cookie-cutter image.

2387
02:47:20,848 --> 02:47:21,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

2388
02:47:21,488 --> 02:47:23,630
[SPEAKER_05]: And... Exactly.

2389
02:47:23,810 --> 02:47:28,333
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd say that's, you know... Maybe actually want to hear the music for once and not just the image.

2390
02:47:28,493 --> 02:47:39,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Far-fetched as it sounds, I think that might be starting to send a message to record companies, and I bet you sales... Well, even sales of Christina's latest album wasn't as good as her first one, and Britney's putting a new one out in October, and it's probably not going to do as well.

2391
02:47:39,642 --> 02:47:41,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's October, but it probably won't do as well.

2392
02:47:42,984 --> 02:47:43,504
[SPEAKER_06]: We will leave.

2393
02:47:43,524 --> 02:47:45,505
[SPEAKER_13]: Wouldn't it be funny if Britney Spears pulled an Alanis?

2394
02:47:45,525 --> 02:47:48,006
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you mean?

2395
02:47:48,026 --> 02:47:48,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Disappeared and came back?

2396
02:47:49,007 --> 02:47:50,688
[SPEAKER_13]: Stop doing happy, happy, poppy?

2397
02:47:51,208 --> 02:47:53,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, for those who don't know... Alanis used to be a very happy, poppy person.

2398
02:47:53,929 --> 02:47:55,030
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually have a video.

2399
02:47:55,290 --> 02:47:58,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Alanis was considered... Alanis Morissette was considered the Tiffany of Canada.

2400
02:47:59,172 --> 02:48:00,552
[SPEAKER_05]: And she had the big, poofy hair.

2401
02:48:01,092 --> 02:48:02,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt LeBlanc was in one of her videos.

2402
02:48:02,673 --> 02:48:03,714
[SPEAKER_05]: She was on the Canadian television.

2403
02:48:03,734 --> 02:48:04,834
[SPEAKER_05]: But she used to have, like, these songs.

2404
02:48:05,114 --> 02:48:08,156
[SPEAKER_05]: I could probably dig up the MP3s on my computer, but I don't... I'm too lazy.

2405
02:48:09,436 --> 02:48:10,877
[SPEAKER_05]: But she used to have, like, really dancey songs.

2406
02:48:11,177 --> 02:48:12,518
[SPEAKER_05]: She disappeared completely...

2407
02:48:12,998 --> 02:48:23,443
[SPEAKER_05]: for about four years and then came back and she'd, like, grown up and that's when she did Jagged Little Pill and it was such a controversy, you know, like, oh, now this teen princess talking about blowjobs in a theater type thing.

2408
02:48:23,983 --> 02:48:26,344
[SPEAKER_05]: But, I mean, if you think about it, the real Tiffany did the same thing.

2409
02:48:26,384 --> 02:48:27,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't she come back and pose for Playboy?

2410
02:48:31,706 --> 02:48:44,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, like, I mean, one thing that I've noticed, too, is all these people who have hella videos and have all these concerts and all these fucking appearances, they, you know, everybody hears their music so much that people just grow to get tired of it.

2411
02:48:44,653 --> 02:48:49,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you got the underground people who will send their demo to a radio station or something and get it played.

2412
02:48:50,036 --> 02:48:52,338
[SPEAKER_06]: More people want to see, more people want to hear...

2413
02:48:52,998 --> 02:48:56,861
[SPEAKER_06]: The people who you don't see every day, as opposed to who you do see every day.

2414
02:48:57,021 --> 02:49:11,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's why I think if we did have a lot of Bimani CDs coming over, or anybody, even a lot of the underground rappers and DJs and stuff like that, most people sit there and they don't really want to really see them.

2415
02:49:11,973 --> 02:49:17,398
[SPEAKER_06]: They like to know who they are, but they like the music so much, and the music is what keeps the mystery and what keeps them wanting to be there.

2416
02:49:17,418 --> 02:49:19,840
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't do a lot of appearances, people are going to want to know who you are.

2417
02:49:20,160 --> 02:49:23,502
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to want to hear your stuff more than like, oh, look, there's that hoe on TV.

2418
02:49:24,202 --> 02:49:25,343
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's that whole thing.

2419
02:49:26,803 --> 02:49:28,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the DJs, they're just a name.

2420
02:49:28,684 --> 02:49:31,245
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just a name so you know which CD to find.

2421
02:49:31,366 --> 02:49:32,066
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

2422
02:49:32,106 --> 02:49:35,808
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you met them in real life, you're like, oh, they're really cool.

2423
02:49:35,828 --> 02:49:36,288
[SPEAKER_07]: You wouldn't be like...

2424
02:49:36,684 --> 02:49:39,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, oh my god, you know, they're so cool.

2425
02:49:39,386 --> 02:49:43,350
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's just, they're just... Wait, if I saw Paul Oakenfold, I'd probably give him a hug.

2426
02:49:43,530 --> 02:49:44,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.

2427
02:49:44,551 --> 02:49:50,055
[SPEAKER_07]: But like, for instance, DJ David X. I mean, he's kind of popular over here.

2428
02:49:50,495 --> 02:49:54,379
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you see him personally, you're like, damn, I don't... He's old.

2429
02:49:54,599 --> 02:49:55,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he's just some...

2430
02:49:56,440 --> 02:49:59,202
[SPEAKER_09]: An actual friend of one of Dan's friends.

2431
02:49:59,722 --> 02:50:00,903
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a DJ in Santa Cruz.

2432
02:50:00,963 --> 02:50:03,525
[SPEAKER_07]: He's cool, and the music he plays is really cool.

2433
02:50:03,585 --> 02:50:04,346
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the whole point, though.

2434
02:50:04,646 --> 02:50:06,007
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like, you know, Britney Spears.

2435
02:50:06,747 --> 02:50:08,909
[SPEAKER_07]: You hear more controversy and shit about them.

2436
02:50:09,209 --> 02:50:13,452
[SPEAKER_07]: When's the last time you've heard, like, a DJ and something weird happening with them?

2437
02:50:13,832 --> 02:50:14,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing.

2438
02:50:14,073 --> 02:50:17,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, Oakenfold, you never hear anything on the news, like, some controversy.

2439
02:50:17,615 --> 02:50:21,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Because he's just too busy making music and, you know, doing actual stuff like that.

2440
02:50:22,789 --> 02:50:29,996
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what actually has made me really happy is that one of my favorite Japanese DJs has his CDs now released in the States, DJ Crush.

2441
02:50:31,257 --> 02:50:32,698
[SPEAKER_13]: Makes me very, very happy.

2442
02:50:32,918 --> 02:50:39,324
[SPEAKER_13]: And from what I understand, I mean, he'll do music for anyone, you know, mixing for anyone.

2443
02:50:40,205 --> 02:50:42,227
[SPEAKER_13]: Just, you know, goes to clubs all the time.

2444
02:50:42,247 --> 02:50:43,328
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish he'd come, actually.

2445
02:50:43,708 --> 02:50:45,810
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, he had performed here because she even went to see him.

2446
02:50:46,010 --> 02:50:46,491
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I...

2447
02:50:47,364 --> 02:50:48,305
[SPEAKER_13]: In San Francisco, I think.

2448
02:50:48,445 --> 02:50:54,650
[SPEAKER_13]: But I would like for just more people internationally to make their music available.

2449
02:50:55,771 --> 02:51:05,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, like, one thing, too, and not a lot of people are familiar with the music, but there's, like, the band called Dream Theater, and I don't know how many people know about them, but they're over in Japan a lot.

2450
02:51:05,238 --> 02:51:10,102
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's their basic residence is in Japan, even though they're a completely English singing group.

2451
02:51:10,762 --> 02:51:15,606
[SPEAKER_06]: And their music sells a lot more over here than it does in Japan.

2452
02:51:17,240 --> 02:51:45,133
[SPEAKER_06]: and they do their just random appearances like once every five years you actually get to see them and it's enough to make a person want to drop everything and go see them because they don't have huge videos over here people like their music I mean I honestly was about to cut my Santa Cruz trip because they're going to be in Sacramento on Sunday and I was about to cut it but I was like nah that's okay but still it's like the point is people will drop what you're doing if they don't see you getting in trouble and they don't see you dressing like an absolute moron and all that kind of stuff and there's still a hairband

2453
02:51:45,854 --> 02:51:46,875
[SPEAKER_05]: They are still a hair band.

2454
02:51:46,955 --> 02:51:47,475
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

2455
02:51:47,495 --> 02:51:48,656
[SPEAKER_05]: They're a hair band.

2456
02:51:49,757 --> 02:51:50,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting point.

2457
02:51:50,318 --> 02:51:51,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm reading in the chat room.

2458
02:51:51,438 --> 02:51:53,360
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just trying to read what folks are saying in the chat room.

2459
02:51:53,400 --> 02:51:55,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Jabberwocky makes an interesting point.

2460
02:51:55,442 --> 02:51:56,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, by the way.

2461
02:51:56,703 --> 02:51:57,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

2462
02:51:57,723 --> 02:52:01,066
[SPEAKER_05]: He was responding to a comment made by Justin, but this is what he says.

2463
02:52:01,086 --> 02:52:04,329
[SPEAKER_05]: He says, the record companies put out hundreds of albums each month.

2464
02:52:04,729 --> 02:52:06,630
[SPEAKER_05]: The terrible music is what people are buying.

2465
02:52:07,931 --> 02:52:08,372
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is that?

2466
02:52:10,461 --> 02:52:11,362
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2467
02:52:30,342 --> 02:52:30,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

2468
02:52:31,883 --> 02:52:33,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did the record company do anything?

2469
02:52:33,325 --> 02:52:33,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Money?

2470
02:52:33,865 --> 02:52:35,026
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

2471
02:52:35,307 --> 02:52:36,207
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my theory.

2472
02:52:36,968 --> 02:52:38,530
[SPEAKER_05]: The publicists behind the artists.

2473
02:52:39,050 --> 02:52:42,373
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a lot of wheeling and dealing that goes on, especially with MTV.

2474
02:52:42,693 --> 02:52:51,742
[SPEAKER_05]: And MTV is to, you know, if you want to use the word blame, credit, whatever you want to choose, MTV is really what's shaping the music industry right now, like it or not.

2475
02:52:53,051 --> 02:52:55,413
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all politics.

2476
02:52:55,433 --> 02:52:58,976
[SPEAKER_13]: The lobbyists pay the politicians, and that's how certain laws get passed.

2477
02:52:59,936 --> 02:53:01,778
[SPEAKER_13]: Although I kind of buy into the Josie theory.

2478
02:53:04,119 --> 02:53:05,320
[SPEAKER_13]: The Josie and the Pussycats.

2479
02:53:06,941 --> 02:53:08,462
[SPEAKER_13]: I will elaborate for people who haven't seen it.

2480
02:53:10,104 --> 02:53:16,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, like, one thing, too, is this is only, you know, stuff that I picked up while working at, like, Intercom Radio and stuff like that.

2481
02:53:17,729 --> 02:53:21,452
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of it, it's not so much who is, you know...

2482
02:53:22,407 --> 02:53:26,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's how old and who looks like what or whatever.

2483
02:53:27,133 --> 02:53:31,659
[SPEAKER_06]: But part of it is the fact that they will go with whoever will dress trashy.

2484
02:53:32,179 --> 02:53:35,824
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's plenty of girls out there I have seen... Shut up.

2485
02:53:37,583 --> 02:53:38,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't start.

2486
02:53:38,244 --> 02:53:38,664
[SPEAKER_06]: No, anyways.

2487
02:53:39,185 --> 02:53:42,388
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's like, there's... What?

2488
02:53:42,408 --> 02:53:43,870
[SPEAKER_06]: I see what you're about to say, though.

2489
02:53:44,511 --> 02:53:47,594
[SPEAKER_06]: They go to see who will dress like the slut, who will do it.

2490
02:53:47,614 --> 02:53:57,064
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's plenty of girls out there who probably look like Britney Spears and who may sound like Britney Spears, but they're the ones who won't go as far as the others went.

2491
02:53:58,346 --> 02:54:05,852
[SPEAKER_06]: and then, yeah, it is MTV partially because they get tons of videos crossing their path every day.

2492
02:54:05,972 --> 02:54:07,113
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't mean they're going to play them all.

2493
02:54:07,213 --> 02:54:13,157
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to play with the ones that all the people are fantasizing about and going home and whacking off about or something.

2494
02:54:13,418 --> 02:54:14,118
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all it is.

2495
02:54:16,480 --> 02:54:18,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, some interesting points here.

2496
02:54:20,583 --> 02:54:25,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Nince says in the chat room, people buy the terrible stuff because they don't know about the better stuff out there.

2497
02:54:27,099 --> 02:54:28,260
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually exactly true.

2498
02:54:28,280 --> 02:54:29,140
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a murder.

2499
02:54:46,182 --> 02:54:47,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I like her stuff.

2500
02:54:48,063 --> 02:54:50,044
[SPEAKER_05]: I like some of her stuff, but it's getting old.

2501
02:54:50,104 --> 02:54:52,745
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like, okay, the pop thing is getting old for me.

2502
02:54:52,905 --> 02:54:54,126
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm cycling on a four-year thing.

2503
02:54:54,546 --> 02:54:56,146
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really care about her new album anymore.

2504
02:54:56,407 --> 02:54:57,347
[SPEAKER_05]: She was cute back in the day.

2505
02:54:57,447 --> 02:54:59,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, look, what a little slut dancing on the screen.

2506
02:54:59,528 --> 02:55:00,368
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't care anymore.

2507
02:55:00,548 --> 02:55:04,370
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a fan of her future porno with her and Christina Aguilera.

2508
02:55:04,510 --> 02:55:07,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, back to the point here.

2509
02:55:08,552 --> 02:55:14,214
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you... There's no real way to force people to expose themselves to new music.

2510
02:55:15,168 --> 02:55:21,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I guess people will like what they want to like, but I feel like it's kind of, sometimes it's ignorance, you know?

2511
02:55:21,111 --> 02:55:23,912
[SPEAKER_03]: We only hear what we can hear on the radio, most people.

2512
02:55:24,172 --> 02:55:30,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Your average music listener isn't a music lover, as in, it's their life, they love it like I do, you know?

2513
02:55:30,675 --> 02:55:34,157
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I have to listen to music all the time, I go watch live music and stuff.

2514
02:55:34,837 --> 02:55:37,478
[SPEAKER_03]: All they can hear is the radio, so they're being told what to listen to.

2515
02:55:37,598 --> 02:55:38,659
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's one thing.

2516
02:55:38,899 --> 02:55:43,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing, yeah, you can't tell them what to listen to, what's terrible music, one person likes something else.

2517
02:55:43,821 --> 02:55:45,803
[SPEAKER_03]: There is actually terrible music.

2518
02:55:46,003 --> 02:55:48,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Britney Spears and stuff is terrible music.

2519
02:55:48,725 --> 02:55:52,388
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no talent behind it except for she has boobs.

2520
02:55:52,608 --> 02:55:53,409
[SPEAKER_03]: She has an ass.

2521
02:55:53,729 --> 02:55:54,990
[SPEAKER_03]: She can't sing worth shit.

2522
02:55:55,110 --> 02:55:56,811
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard so many people who can sing better.

2523
02:55:56,911 --> 02:55:59,133
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think... Hold on, hold on.

2524
02:55:59,613 --> 02:55:59,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

2525
02:55:59,954 --> 02:56:00,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Question, question.

2526
02:56:01,054 --> 02:56:03,176
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about those people?

2527
02:56:03,276 --> 02:56:04,397
[SPEAKER_05]: And just, they're idiots.

2528
02:56:04,437 --> 02:56:05,278
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not an acceptable answer.

2529
02:56:05,538 --> 02:56:11,943
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about those people on, like, the fan shows that talk about Britney Spears and say, Britney Spears changed my life?

2530
02:56:12,814 --> 02:56:16,176
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's exactly... There's fans of... Go ahead.

2531
02:56:16,216 --> 02:56:17,517
[SPEAKER_07]: There's fans of everyone, okay?

2532
02:56:17,577 --> 02:56:19,398
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure Bob Saget has a huge following.

2533
02:56:19,798 --> 02:56:21,639
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure, like, Carrot Top has a huge following.

2534
02:56:21,700 --> 02:56:23,200
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Bob Saget, man.

2535
02:56:23,220 --> 02:56:25,842
[SPEAKER_07]: I suck dick for coke, or what was it?

2536
02:56:25,902 --> 02:56:27,463
[SPEAKER_07]: There's fans for everybody.

2537
02:56:27,543 --> 02:56:32,066
[SPEAKER_07]: There's fans for anybody that appears on TV for, like, just a second.

2538
02:56:32,366 --> 02:56:34,067
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, G4's Portal.

2539
02:56:34,267 --> 02:56:35,508
[SPEAKER_07]: That stupid guy that had...

2540
02:56:35,968 --> 02:56:37,229
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2541
02:56:55,236 --> 02:56:57,757
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's just mainstream stuff right now.

2542
02:56:57,877 --> 02:57:04,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, for instance, I don't know really why people buy their CDs and stuff since it's played on the record all, or on the radio all the time.

2543
02:57:05,139 --> 02:57:09,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, for instance, 98 Rock in our Sacramento area here plays the same shit every day.

2544
02:57:09,561 --> 02:57:13,662
[SPEAKER_07]: I can guarantee that I'll hear, like, a few songs, you know, certain songs every day.

2545
02:57:14,663 --> 02:57:17,263
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it's just like a same playlist that's randomized.

2546
02:57:17,283 --> 02:57:21,385
[SPEAKER_06]: When I worked at 98 Rock, we, my eight hour shift, you would hear a song 12 times.

2547
02:57:22,501 --> 02:57:26,424
[SPEAKER_06]: and it would be the exact same, say maybe 13, 14 songs.

2548
02:57:26,845 --> 02:57:28,506
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be the same song 12 times a day.

2549
02:57:29,026 --> 02:57:30,227
[SPEAKER_06]: At least in one 8 hour show.

2550
02:57:30,327 --> 02:57:30,868
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what though?

2551
02:57:30,908 --> 02:57:31,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll say this though.

2552
02:57:32,149 --> 02:57:34,891
[SPEAKER_05]: I got called from 98 Rock a couple times.

2553
02:57:35,611 --> 02:57:41,336
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how I ended up on their list or whatever, but they called and would ask me to listen to little seconds of songs.

2554
02:57:41,616 --> 02:57:50,423
[SPEAKER_05]: And the only reason I did it, I usually don't participate in those phone survey things, but I actually knew, I'm like, okay, what I'm saying might actually really have an effect on what they're going to play on the station, so I should participate.

2555
02:57:50,443 --> 02:57:51,144
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was funny because...

2556
02:57:51,904 --> 02:57:53,704
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the songs I'd never heard of before.

2557
02:57:53,925 --> 02:57:54,705
[SPEAKER_05]: It was actually interesting.

2558
02:57:54,745 --> 02:58:03,967
[SPEAKER_05]: So they were trying to test stuff I'd never heard before, but the majority of it that I found in myself liking was kind of a lot of the mainstream stuff I'd say, just because I was familiar with it.

2559
02:58:04,327 --> 02:58:08,008
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, there was a lot of that stuff I did recognize as me not liking.

2560
02:58:08,068 --> 02:58:16,290
[SPEAKER_13]: I took one of those where they'd have me compare to, and my response to actually a lot of what they'd play, I would be like, I don't like either, I don't like either, I don't like either.

2561
02:58:16,950 --> 02:58:26,254
[SPEAKER_13]: I forgot to tell you, this is totally a different subject Garrett ordered a video of Kana videos And so he's going to get it soon and you're going to have to come over and watch them

2562
02:58:39,827 --> 02:58:39,867
[SPEAKER_05]: C.D.

2563
02:58:39,887 --> 02:58:39,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Japan

2564
02:58:55,940 --> 02:58:58,942
[SPEAKER_06]: You wanna find, like, good music?

2565
02:58:59,343 --> 02:59:03,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't you just do what a lot of people do, because every different type of music has this.

2566
02:59:03,706 --> 02:59:05,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't you go out and buy, like, samplers?

2567
02:59:05,747 --> 02:59:13,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Because samplers, a lot of the times, not all the time, it depends on which label you go through, they will play new bands that not a lot of people have heard of.

2568
02:59:14,193 --> 02:59:16,555
[SPEAKER_06]: And, yeah, compilations and stuff like that.

2569
02:59:16,775 --> 02:59:17,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Go find those.

2570
02:59:18,176 --> 02:59:19,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Play it, listen to them.

2571
02:59:19,397 --> 02:59:19,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly...

2572
02:59:20,672 --> 02:59:21,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, movie soundtracks also.

2573
02:59:22,153 --> 02:59:30,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Because honestly, you're going to find most of the music you're going to have in your music collections if you start buying compilation samplers are going to be all the ones you got off of those.

2574
02:59:30,976 --> 02:59:38,299
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically, it really sucks, but stop listening to the fucking radio for five minutes and go out and spend five bucks and buy a damn sampler.

2575
02:59:41,963 --> 02:59:45,688
[SPEAKER_10]: I just have a really simple basic theory.

2576
02:59:47,090 --> 02:59:55,482
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just that people are going for what's familiar and what's simple, something that's not too complex.

2577
02:59:56,374 --> 02:59:58,756
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, exactly.

2578
03:00:01,318 --> 03:00:04,761
[SPEAKER_10]: So they go for Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera because it's simple.

2579
03:00:05,682 --> 03:00:08,785
[SPEAKER_10]: But then everyone goes through their cycles of music.

2580
03:00:08,825 --> 03:00:09,365
[SPEAKER_10]: They change.

2581
03:00:09,405 --> 03:00:12,308
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'm not listening to the same stuff I listened to 10 years ago, 5 years ago, whatever.

2582
03:00:12,328 --> 03:00:14,510
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it always evolves.

2583
03:00:15,491 --> 03:00:16,211
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to pass the mic.

2584
03:00:16,251 --> 03:00:17,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's try and wrap this up.

2585
03:00:17,392 --> 03:00:19,454
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to say really quick.

2586
03:00:19,514 --> 03:00:20,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, go for it, Jamie.

2587
03:00:20,635 --> 03:00:23,517
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, if you look at it this year, like, what do we have today, the Backstreet Boys?

2588
03:00:24,118 --> 03:00:27,520
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, when I was in middle school, we had New Kids on the Block, okay?

2589
03:00:28,081 --> 03:00:31,983
[SPEAKER_13]: In the 70s, there was, you know, the Partridge Family, but there was, you know, David Cassidy.

2590
03:00:32,744 --> 03:00:36,167
[SPEAKER_13]: How many, he had fangirls, you know, just like when he died.

2591
03:00:37,007 --> 03:00:39,569
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have the same thing happen today over these Poppy people.

2592
03:00:40,590 --> 03:00:42,371
[SPEAKER_13]: It's because they have an image that can be sold.

2593
03:00:44,012 --> 03:00:46,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the thing, okay, really quick.

2594
03:00:47,566 --> 03:00:48,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

2595
03:01:09,455 --> 03:01:11,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay, you can still be in that job and do good music.

2596
03:01:11,497 --> 03:01:18,584
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, if you think about some of the best artists, not just music, art, anything, have been freaking Looney Tunes.

2597
03:01:18,704 --> 03:01:22,187
[SPEAKER_13]: Like Van Gogh, high on absinthe and cut off his ear.

2598
03:01:22,968 --> 03:01:23,348
[SPEAKER_13]: You know?

2599
03:01:26,731 --> 03:01:27,952
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't remember the composer now.

2600
03:01:29,454 --> 03:01:29,674
[SPEAKER_13]: But...

2601
03:01:30,595 --> 03:01:37,357
[SPEAKER_13]: gave himself cholera-infected water so that he would die because he was... I was going to say real fast about five minutes ago.

2602
03:01:37,617 --> 03:01:47,421
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, as Zero was saying about the radio and, you know, stop listening to radio or whatever, try, and this is going to be a really cheap plug, but I'm serious here, go to internet radio.

2603
03:01:47,721 --> 03:01:49,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Look around on Live365.

2604
03:01:49,081 --> 03:01:53,743
[SPEAKER_05]: There are thousands of stations that are worth your time to listen to.

2605
03:01:53,763 --> 03:01:56,724
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want to sample new music, internet radio is a great way to do it because you have...

2606
03:01:57,546 --> 03:02:01,948
[SPEAKER_05]: You have weirdos like us sitting here that put together their own stations of stuff they like.

2607
03:02:02,348 --> 03:02:03,948
[SPEAKER_05]: And how do you find out about a lot of music?

2608
03:02:04,208 --> 03:02:05,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Through your friends and what they like.

2609
03:02:06,029 --> 03:02:09,930
[SPEAKER_05]: So go look at some other stations out there on Line 365.

2610
03:02:10,711 --> 03:02:15,492
[SPEAKER_05]: We give you permission to go away from Orange Lounge Radio for a little while to go check out some other stations.

2611
03:02:15,532 --> 03:02:16,013
[SPEAKER_05]: But not very long.

2612
03:02:16,033 --> 03:02:16,513
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to come back.

2613
03:02:18,158 --> 03:02:19,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, 30 minutes, go.

2614
03:02:20,319 --> 03:02:24,941
[SPEAKER_07]: What I was going to say, you were talking about Van Gogh.

2615
03:02:25,061 --> 03:02:30,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, no, Jamie was saying Van Gogh, he was such a talented artist, he was high on absinthe and cut off his ear, what'd he do?

2616
03:02:31,763 --> 03:02:32,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Send it to his girlfriend.

2617
03:02:33,144 --> 03:02:37,365
[SPEAKER_07]: He sent it to his girlfriend, I was like, well, I wonder, I bet the letter said, can you hear me now?

2618
03:02:39,566 --> 03:02:41,007
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that doesn't make sense, but it was funny.

2619
03:02:42,552 --> 03:02:46,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have a final thought on the other topic?

2620
03:02:46,713 --> 03:02:47,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

2621
03:02:47,453 --> 03:02:48,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thought that I have.

2622
03:02:49,654 --> 03:02:56,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Go online, get your nice file sharing service, and download massive amounts of MP3s from artists you don't recognize.

2623
03:02:57,015 --> 03:03:06,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't buy the CDs, because stupid artists, they don't deserve money, because if their music sucks, then they should learn, okay, no one's buying my CD, maybe I should think of a new career.

2624
03:03:10,217 --> 03:03:17,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you put the disclaimer at the beginning that some of these people, their views and opinions do not reflect the opinions of Orange Lounge Radio?

2625
03:03:17,739 --> 03:03:19,379
[SPEAKER_06]: If they don't know that by now, they're retarded.

2626
03:03:20,819 --> 03:03:21,239
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

2627
03:03:21,579 --> 03:03:22,640
[SPEAKER_06]: He's absolutely right, though.

2628
03:03:23,300 --> 03:03:25,880
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can't make music, stop making crappy music.

2629
03:03:25,940 --> 03:03:29,961
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have enough people telling you, hey, buddy, you're shitty, then stop making music.

2630
03:03:30,021 --> 03:03:30,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes that doesn't work.

2631
03:03:32,001 --> 03:03:33,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, back to the Britney Spears analogy.

2632
03:03:33,801 --> 03:03:36,882
[SPEAKER_05]: What about the one that says, you changed my life through your music?

2633
03:03:39,026 --> 03:03:41,207
[SPEAKER_06]: There's always going to be somebody who says that.

2634
03:03:41,227 --> 03:03:42,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Guess what?

2635
03:03:42,068 --> 03:03:43,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Ghost in the Shell changed my life.

2636
03:03:44,069 --> 03:03:47,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it made me want to be a ghost in the shell.

2637
03:03:47,351 --> 03:03:48,732
[SPEAKER_06]: It's stupid.

2638
03:03:48,832 --> 03:03:51,253
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys know how to make Lego sex.

2639
03:03:51,653 --> 03:03:53,815
[SPEAKER_13]: First of all, all those people who are saying, oh, this changed my life.

2640
03:03:54,335 --> 03:03:57,357
[SPEAKER_13]: First and foremost, the only one you should change your life for is yourself.

2641
03:03:57,477 --> 03:04:01,059
[SPEAKER_13]: You need to take responsibility for yourself.

2642
03:04:01,079 --> 03:04:02,780
[SPEAKER_13]: That's sad that one song changes your life.

2643
03:04:03,440 --> 03:04:06,983
[SPEAKER_13]: The biggest problem with people today is they don't take responsibility for themselves.

2644
03:04:07,003 --> 03:04:10,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that scares me that Britney Spears is changing all these youngins' life.

2645
03:04:10,425 --> 03:04:12,186
[SPEAKER_03]: It just scares me for my future.

2646
03:04:12,507 --> 03:04:15,569
[SPEAKER_13]: They're putting the responsibility for their changes on other people.

2647
03:04:15,789 --> 03:04:17,850
[SPEAKER_13]: They're blaming other people for what's going on in their lives.

2648
03:04:17,910 --> 03:04:20,772
[SPEAKER_13]: They need to start taking responsibility and be their own person.

2649
03:04:22,874 --> 03:04:23,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2650
03:04:23,274 --> 03:04:24,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it changed my life.

2651
03:04:24,255 --> 03:04:27,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I wear short skirts and I have sex with everybody.

2652
03:04:30,463 --> 03:04:33,267
[SPEAKER_05]: We had intelligent conversation We had intelligent conversation and debate

2653
03:04:46,683 --> 03:04:48,886
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess that's debatable, and I'm sure our chatroom debates that right now.

2654
03:04:49,066 --> 03:04:50,788
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about porn, we worked porn in.

2655
03:04:53,031 --> 03:04:54,572
[SPEAKER_05]: We got the blowjob thing in at the beginning.

2656
03:04:57,496 --> 03:04:59,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we worked at the truck stop.

2657
03:04:59,418 --> 03:05:03,522
[SPEAKER_05]: So, now I'm going to ask everybody, thank you everybody, what a good way to end Season 2.

2658
03:05:04,123 --> 03:05:06,245
[SPEAKER_05]: What a very nice way to end the Season 2 finale there.

2659
03:05:07,286 --> 03:05:12,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a reminder, everybody, next week, no show, but we got an even better thing planned.

2660
03:05:12,210 --> 03:05:16,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Saturday, live, all freaking day, from B3, the tournament of the century!

2661
03:05:18,194 --> 03:05:18,694
[SPEAKER_05]: At Pier 39.

2662
03:05:20,515 --> 03:05:22,857
[SPEAKER_05]: We might be there Sunday as well, don't know yet.

2663
03:05:23,798 --> 03:05:24,198
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

2664
03:05:25,279 --> 03:05:28,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, let me go around and get some final thoughts from everybody.

2665
03:05:28,721 --> 03:05:29,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie, you want to start or you want to be last?

2666
03:05:30,462 --> 03:05:30,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be last.

2667
03:05:31,063 --> 03:05:32,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, Brad, final thought.

2668
03:05:33,504 --> 03:05:33,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2669
03:05:36,619 --> 03:05:38,441
[SPEAKER_03]: What lesson did we learn today, kids?

2670
03:05:38,961 --> 03:05:41,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Music industry is communism.

2671
03:05:41,523 --> 03:05:42,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't follow them.

2672
03:05:43,685 --> 03:05:44,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, okay.

2673
03:05:45,066 --> 03:05:45,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Irene, final thought?

2674
03:05:46,807 --> 03:05:47,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't have to be about the topic.

2675
03:05:47,928 --> 03:05:49,089
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been discussing anything you want.

2676
03:05:50,896 --> 03:05:51,496
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm tired.

2677
03:05:51,716 --> 03:05:52,317
[SPEAKER_05]: You're tired?

2678
03:05:52,477 --> 03:05:52,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2679
03:05:52,977 --> 03:05:53,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry, babe.

2680
03:05:53,618 --> 03:05:55,098
[SPEAKER_05]: What time did you get to bed last night?

2681
03:05:56,139 --> 03:05:56,919
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't go to bed last night.

2682
03:05:56,939 --> 03:06:00,801
[SPEAKER_10]: I went to bed this morning at, like, what, 6 o'clock this morning.

2683
03:06:00,821 --> 03:06:02,683
[SPEAKER_10]: We went to Denny's after we dropped you off or whatever.

2684
03:06:02,763 --> 03:06:03,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, did you?

2685
03:06:03,183 --> 03:06:03,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2686
03:06:03,983 --> 03:06:05,044
[SPEAKER_05]: I was so tired, you guys.

2687
03:06:05,084 --> 03:06:05,984
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so crazy.

2688
03:06:06,024 --> 03:06:08,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Brad had to drive me home anyway.

2689
03:06:08,206 --> 03:06:08,986
[SPEAKER_05]: People don't want to hear that.

2690
03:06:09,006 --> 03:06:10,587
[SPEAKER_05]: People don't want to hear about that stuff.

2691
03:06:10,647 --> 03:06:11,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I was very tired.

2692
03:06:11,748 --> 03:06:12,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I slept for 12 hours today.

2693
03:06:12,948 --> 03:06:13,609
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't wake up until 4.

2694
03:06:14,889 --> 03:06:15,770
[SPEAKER_05]: We drove it home, too.

2695
03:06:16,530 --> 03:06:16,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

2696
03:06:17,571 --> 03:06:18,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, final thought?

2697
03:06:18,691 --> 03:06:19,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.

2698
03:06:19,172 --> 03:06:19,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Were you done?

2699
03:06:19,532 --> 03:06:19,572
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

2700
03:06:20,353 --> 03:06:20,954
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm done.

2701
03:06:21,154 --> 03:06:21,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2702
03:06:21,634 --> 03:06:22,135
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're spent.

2703
03:06:22,435 --> 03:06:23,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's busy working.

2704
03:06:23,316 --> 03:06:23,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me ask Zero.

2705
03:06:24,077 --> 03:06:24,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Zero, final thought.

2706
03:06:26,579 --> 03:06:33,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, my final thought is take everything we have said about the radio and use it in your daily life.

2707
03:06:33,827 --> 03:06:40,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't be conformist and be an individual and don't let people tell you what to do and don't let them tell you what to like.

2708
03:06:43,268 --> 03:06:49,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Be yourself, or else we'll just have a bunch of robots running around and it'll just end up being the destruction of the human fucking race.

2709
03:06:49,529 --> 03:06:49,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Goodbye.

2710
03:06:50,830 --> 03:06:52,590
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I will go ahead and give my final thought.

2711
03:06:52,610 --> 03:06:55,851
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is thank you everybody for supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

2712
03:06:55,951 --> 03:06:59,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you everybody who listens to this show every Sunday, our fans.

2713
03:07:00,472 --> 03:07:08,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, by the way, to Kesa at Field of Pulse Radio, or fieldofpulse.net, Pulse Radio, for letting me be on a show on Saturday and promote tonight's show.

2714
03:07:08,413 --> 03:07:08,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2715
03:07:09,194 --> 03:07:10,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Check that out if you're into Sims Online and all that.

2716
03:07:11,674 --> 03:07:15,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you everybody who supports Orange Lounge Radio and listens to our Bimani Music Amore program.

2717
03:07:16,318 --> 03:07:18,660
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been almost a year now that we've been doing Orange Lounge.

2718
03:07:18,680 --> 03:07:19,361
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a blast.

2719
03:07:19,781 --> 03:07:22,823
[SPEAKER_05]: And in two weeks we come back to you with Orange Lounge Radio Season 3.

2720
03:07:23,784 --> 03:07:27,007
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have a webcam of some sorts to show things when we want to show them to you.

2721
03:07:27,765 --> 03:07:29,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Phones, we're working on it.

2722
03:07:29,226 --> 03:07:30,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki is busy.

2723
03:07:30,366 --> 03:07:32,987
[SPEAKER_05]: We were hoping that the phones would be the big thing we can bring into Season 3.

2724
03:07:33,287 --> 03:07:36,548
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know if we can have it the first week, but Loki is on it.

2725
03:07:36,769 --> 03:07:39,210
[SPEAKER_05]: And we all know that that means scary.

2726
03:07:39,270 --> 03:07:40,490
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you everybody for your support.

2727
03:07:40,530 --> 03:07:42,071
[SPEAKER_11]: We appreciate it.

2728
03:07:43,491 --> 03:07:44,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, quick.

2729
03:07:44,932 --> 03:07:47,093
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to let Jamie do her final thought and then we'll end with yours.

2730
03:07:48,093 --> 03:07:48,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Jamie?

2731
03:07:49,734 --> 03:07:51,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Mine is, give me a dollar.

2732
03:07:53,095 --> 03:07:55,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Len Loki, dare I ask, what's your final thought?

2733
03:07:56,132 --> 03:08:05,280
[SPEAKER_07]: What I don't understand in this world is how there can be so many hidden camera people with these ugly guys going out, finding people in random places and getting them to do sexual acts on them.

2734
03:08:05,640 --> 03:08:09,263
[SPEAKER_07]: So I leave you with yet another streetblowjob.com video.

2735
03:08:09,523 --> 03:08:10,664
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you doing in here?

2736
03:08:10,684 --> 03:08:11,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Just killing time?

2737
03:08:12,706 --> 03:08:13,226
Yeah.

2738
03:08:13,346 --> 03:08:14,087
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's in arcade.

2739
03:08:14,107 --> 03:08:15,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, DDR related.

2740
03:08:15,628 --> 03:08:17,270
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure there's DDR in that arcade somewhere.

2741
03:08:20,512 --> 03:08:21,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks like Scandia.

2742
03:08:26,453 --> 03:08:27,373
[SPEAKER_14]: Pretty open-minded girl?

2743
03:08:29,734 --> 03:08:30,834
[SPEAKER_14]: I kind of have a moral fetish.

2744
03:08:30,854 --> 03:08:33,095
[SPEAKER_20]: What do you think about it?

2745
03:08:33,135 --> 03:08:34,195
[SPEAKER_14]: You think about it?

2746
03:08:34,575 --> 03:08:35,435
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think?

2747
03:08:35,455 --> 03:08:37,055
[SPEAKER_20]: You into that?

2748
03:08:37,095 --> 03:08:37,295
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2749
03:08:37,355 --> 03:08:37,695
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

2750
03:08:37,715 --> 03:08:38,516
[SPEAKER_20]: Just a little feminist.

2751
03:08:53,380 --> 03:08:56,383
[SPEAKER_17]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2752
