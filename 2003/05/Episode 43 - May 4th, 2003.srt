1
00:00:00,516 --> 00:00:02,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Message for you, son!

2
00:00:03,318 --> 00:00:04,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Attention!

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to hear the most annoying sound in the world?

4
00:00:10,684 --> 00:00:15,708
[SPEAKER_01]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio, the Monty Talk, and then some.

5
00:00:19,378 --> 00:00:22,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

7
00:00:26,362 --> 00:00:29,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

8
00:00:29,624 --> 00:00:32,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge may contain hot monkey sex.

9
00:00:33,307 --> 00:00:33,727
[SPEAKER_21]: Just kidding.

10
00:00:33,907 --> 00:00:35,508
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Lounge will not contain hot monkey sex.

11
00:00:35,728 --> 00:00:43,192
[SPEAKER_03]: In this episode... Hey, are there any balls down there?

12
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:45,894
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the biggest berry you've ever seen, Jingleberry.

13
00:00:45,994 --> 00:00:46,935
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your favorite skit?

14
00:00:49,142 --> 00:00:49,723
[SPEAKER_12]: Showgirls.

15
00:00:50,623 --> 00:00:51,784
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely frightening.

16
00:00:52,044 --> 00:00:52,585
[SPEAKER_12]: What's yours?

17
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:55,326
[SPEAKER_12]: There are no stupid questions, just stupid people.

18
00:00:55,387 --> 00:00:56,627
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't torture yourself.

19
00:00:57,268 --> 00:00:58,169
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my job.

20
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:00,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Now's the time on Sprockets and me dogs!

21
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,753
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog too!

22
00:01:05,113 --> 00:01:05,934
[SPEAKER_18]: I know Kung Fu.

23
00:01:06,394 --> 00:01:08,776
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

24
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:10,898
[SPEAKER_12]: Why did they have to take the word game?

25
00:01:12,499 --> 00:01:15,161
[SPEAKER_07]: No one expects a Spanish exposition!

26
00:01:15,381 --> 00:01:16,001
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Kendo.

27
00:01:16,021 --> 00:01:16,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Kendo!

28
00:01:19,093 --> 00:01:20,895
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura Shut up!

29
00:01:21,095 --> 00:01:21,776
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's my gun?

30
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:24,238
[SPEAKER_09]: This is my boomstick!

31
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:26,841
[SPEAKER_21]: Sky Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb!

32
00:01:27,141 --> 00:01:30,845
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me.

33
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:33,708
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of warped human being would find that funny?

34
00:01:33,949 --> 00:01:35,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio

35
00:01:38,183 --> 00:01:42,366
[SPEAKER_21]: We are live, and this is episode number 43 for May the 4th of 2003.

36
00:01:42,466 --> 00:01:50,052
[SPEAKER_21]: You're tuned into the B-Money Scene's most on-the-move radio station of all things B-Money.

37
00:01:50,552 --> 00:01:52,494
[SPEAKER_21]: My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

38
00:01:52,874 --> 00:01:57,297
[SPEAKER_21]: Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts, and this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers.

39
00:01:57,337 --> 00:01:58,518
[SPEAKER_21]: You know her better as Dark Sakura.

40
00:01:58,778 --> 00:01:59,939
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the corner of the couch.

41
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I register?

42
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,901
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, we can hear you just fine.

43
00:02:03,362 --> 00:02:03,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

44
00:02:04,227 --> 00:02:06,228
[SPEAKER_21]: In that corner, say hello to our tech master, Loki.

45
00:02:06,468 --> 00:02:09,510
[SPEAKER_20]: This cord is so long, I can broadcast from inside my room.

46
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,331
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just crazy.

47
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:11,512
[SPEAKER_20]: You can go in the bathroom.

48
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:14,654
[SPEAKER_20]: I can go all the way into your closet, man.

49
00:02:14,674 --> 00:02:15,194
[SPEAKER_21]: Seriously.

50
00:02:15,234 --> 00:02:16,535
[SPEAKER_21]: Come out of the closet, Loki.

51
00:02:16,575 --> 00:02:17,736
[SPEAKER_21]: Come out of the closet, please.

52
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,457
[SPEAKER_20]: I am broadcasting from inside my room.

53
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:27,106
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll be talking, we have a brand new setup for Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

54
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:32,791
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll be talking all about that after this break because I have to go and give Jamie her ferret or she's going to throw a fit.

55
00:02:33,572 --> 00:02:37,796
[SPEAKER_21]: There are no guests in studio yet, but we're hoping that some folks are going to show up.

56
00:02:39,797 --> 00:02:41,939
[SPEAKER_21]: It's kind of a new night for Orange Lounge.

57
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,462
[SPEAKER_21]: We're not quite yet to season three, but changes are slowly happening.

58
00:02:45,983 --> 00:02:48,045
[SPEAKER_21]: So, it'll be interesting for sure.

59
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,964
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll be back after some of our favorite 2DX music.

60
00:02:52,164 --> 00:02:52,705
[SPEAKER_21]: Enjoy!

61
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,358
Thank you for watching!

62
00:05:36,557 --> 00:05:45,821
I just wanna scream it, baby can you hear me, hear me what I'm saying, baby please, put your love, maybe for a moment, maybe for forever, I just wanna hold you, I just wanna know you, tell me that

63
00:06:12,056 --> 00:06:14,740
Thank you for watching.

64
00:06:30,905 --> 00:06:31,846
Thanks for watching!

65
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:13,064
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

66
00:08:13,304 --> 00:08:15,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to be staffed by Hollywood?

67
00:08:15,065 --> 00:08:15,385
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

68
00:08:15,545 --> 00:08:19,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we care what people think of us?

69
00:08:19,807 --> 00:08:21,648
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

70
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

71
00:08:23,588 --> 00:08:24,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes!

72
00:08:27,655 --> 00:08:29,497
[SPEAKER_01]: Extreme Bobani Radio.

73
00:08:29,737 --> 00:08:32,560
[SPEAKER_21]: That's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

74
00:08:33,361 --> 00:08:41,588
[SPEAKER_21]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio and as promised we're coming to you from our brand new studio which is interesting.

75
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:47,374
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm hoping by next week we can have the return of the Orange Lounge webcam just so you guys can see what we're dealing with here but...

76
00:08:47,634 --> 00:08:52,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Get a nice one and mount it on the ceiling and have it, like, span across the room.

77
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,200
[SPEAKER_21]: That would be pretty cool.

78
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,666
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, I'm thinking we might be able to mount a webcam somewhere, like, up in there where you could see, like, the whole living room and the back corner.

79
00:08:59,467 --> 00:09:00,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Right in the corner.

80
00:09:01,229 --> 00:09:02,170
[SPEAKER_09]: And see your pink carpet.

81
00:09:03,311 --> 00:09:04,212
[SPEAKER_21]: It's rose, damn it.

82
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:04,733
[SPEAKER_21]: Pink.

83
00:09:05,814 --> 00:09:21,005
[SPEAKER_21]: for those that don't really follow what's going on in our personal lives which thank you for not stalking us I moved out of my house my old roommate was buying the house and was raising the rent and I'm too poe so I went to get a new place and Loki

84
00:09:22,026 --> 00:09:22,726
[SPEAKER_21]: Wanted a roommate.

85
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:24,627
[SPEAKER_21]: Wanted to move out of where he was at, too.

86
00:09:24,747 --> 00:09:26,408
[SPEAKER_21]: So we decided to get an apartment together.

87
00:09:26,928 --> 00:09:30,510
[SPEAKER_21]: And now we are in Folsom, California, which is one of the many suburbs of Sacramento.

88
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,210
[SPEAKER_21]: We're in the snooty town.

89
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,131
[SPEAKER_21]: We're in the snooty suburb.

90
00:09:33,151 --> 00:09:35,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait till we get to my fuck you of the week.

91
00:09:36,632 --> 00:09:37,153
[SPEAKER_21]: Can't wait.

92
00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:39,614
[SPEAKER_21]: So now we're in Folsom.

93
00:09:39,634 --> 00:09:41,655
[SPEAKER_21]: And this is interesting because Loki and I live together.

94
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:45,976
[SPEAKER_21]: Now it's not like we really have to be considerate of anyone else during the show.

95
00:09:47,017 --> 00:09:49,038
[SPEAKER_21]: Because Loki and I, being two-thirds of the staff...

96
00:09:50,138 --> 00:09:51,659
[SPEAKER_21]: This show pretty much runs the apartment.

97
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:57,301
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I mean, yeah, we have to be considerate of the neighbors upstairs and the neighbors next door, as we found out the other day.

98
00:09:57,321 --> 00:10:00,223
[SPEAKER_20]: That was only because we were allowed after 10pm.

99
00:10:00,923 --> 00:10:02,364
[SPEAKER_20]: Before 10pm is fair game.

100
00:10:03,044 --> 00:10:07,326
[SPEAKER_20]: And if they ever complain about us being too loud before 10pm, they can kiss my black ass.

101
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:07,966
[SPEAKER_20]: Seriously.

102
00:10:08,947 --> 00:10:11,108
[SPEAKER_08]: What, after it gets kicked to that color?

103
00:10:12,972 --> 00:10:15,874
[SPEAKER_21]: Now what's interesting about this new setup is I'm not even looking at the chatroom right now.

104
00:10:15,934 --> 00:10:20,957
[SPEAKER_21]: Our microphone cords are so long that we can just walk to and from the living room.

105
00:10:20,997 --> 00:10:23,699
[SPEAKER_21]: And so we don't really have anyone monitoring the chatroom yet.

106
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:29,363
[SPEAKER_21]: But I'm hoping that once Intern Zero gets here, maybe he can help us out by monitoring the chatroom.

107
00:10:29,403 --> 00:10:31,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe he can tell I'm eating dry ramen.

108
00:10:31,144 --> 00:10:32,325
[SPEAKER_09]: What an appropriate shirt, Rob.

109
00:10:32,945 --> 00:10:33,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

110
00:10:33,686 --> 00:10:35,307
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm wearing my Dr. Frankenfurter shirt today.

111
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:36,227
[SPEAKER_21]: It's lovely.

112
00:10:36,247 --> 00:10:37,748
[SPEAKER_21]: What were you saying, Loki?

113
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:40,010
[SPEAKER_20]: I said anything I can tell I'm eating dry ramen.

114
00:10:40,655 --> 00:10:41,796
[SPEAKER_21]: You're eating dry ramen.

115
00:10:41,816 --> 00:10:42,797
[SPEAKER_21]: That's got to be nasty.

116
00:10:43,037 --> 00:10:43,858
[SPEAKER_20]: I love this stuff.

117
00:10:43,878 --> 00:10:44,218
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me try.

118
00:10:44,238 --> 00:10:44,858
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to try some.

119
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:45,719
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm kind of curious.

120
00:10:45,739 --> 00:10:48,101
[SPEAKER_20]: You have to put the chicken seasoning on, because that's awesome.

121
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:49,662
[SPEAKER_20]: It's really salty and tastes damn good.

122
00:10:50,022 --> 00:10:51,023
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want salty.

123
00:10:51,063 --> 00:10:51,824
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to try some.

124
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:54,126
[SPEAKER_21]: Ew.

125
00:10:55,527 --> 00:10:56,027
[SPEAKER_21]: It's weird.

126
00:10:58,549 --> 00:10:59,830
[SPEAKER_21]: You are a strange kid, Loki.

127
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:00,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, not bad.

128
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:04,088
[SPEAKER_21]: So we did get a special guest joining us during that break.

129
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,629
[SPEAKER_21]: Say hello, special guest.

130
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:07,630
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello, special guest.

131
00:11:09,131 --> 00:11:09,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Smartass.

132
00:11:11,112 --> 00:11:11,852
[SPEAKER_21]: How are you doing, Bradley?

133
00:11:12,252 --> 00:11:13,073
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm doing okay today.

134
00:11:14,494 --> 00:11:17,295
[SPEAKER_21]: A big thank you, by the way, for helping Loki and I move into this place.

135
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:18,296
[SPEAKER_21]: No problem.

136
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,017
[SPEAKER_21]: What was the nastiest thing you had to move for one of us?

137
00:11:21,317 --> 00:11:22,598
[SPEAKER_21]: The whole underwear.

138
00:11:25,421 --> 00:11:25,722
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

139
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:28,863
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe some old boxes of stuff.

140
00:11:28,923 --> 00:11:29,443
[SPEAKER_18]: Old boxes.

141
00:11:29,943 --> 00:11:30,563
[SPEAKER_18]: Old boxes of stuff.

142
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:31,844
[SPEAKER_21]: My Pikachu.

143
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:33,504
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, my Pikachu.

144
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:34,365
[SPEAKER_21]: That was the scariest thing.

145
00:11:34,645 --> 00:11:35,885
[SPEAKER_21]: Bradley had to move.

146
00:11:36,886 --> 00:11:38,586
[SPEAKER_21]: What's interesting now is that we have a kitchen.

147
00:11:39,927 --> 00:11:47,970
[SPEAKER_21]: Because the way our apartment is, the kitchen is literally right next to the workstations and our living room.

148
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,151
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't wait until we get the webcam so we can show all you guys this.

149
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:56,655
[SPEAKER_21]: But you might hear Jamie kind of running back and forth to the kitchen, hurry up and cook, Popeye, and things like that.

150
00:11:57,596 --> 00:12:00,779
[SPEAKER_20]: I can watch Simpsons while doing a show.

151
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:01,319
[SPEAKER_20]: The best.

152
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,541
[SPEAKER_20]: Best ever.

153
00:12:03,561 --> 00:12:05,923
[SPEAKER_21]: But you'd be too easily distracted, Mr. Loki.

154
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,825
[SPEAKER_21]: So?

155
00:12:08,885 --> 00:12:09,666
[SPEAKER_18]: That'll ruin any show.

156
00:12:12,071 --> 00:12:16,934
[SPEAKER_21]: But what is interesting is that now we're sitting here in the living room, we can fire up the PlayStation and play whatever games are new.

157
00:12:17,315 --> 00:12:19,336
[SPEAKER_21]: For instance, if we wanted to, we could fire up Max 2.

158
00:12:19,596 --> 00:12:20,917
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, if I didn't already outplay it.

159
00:12:21,097 --> 00:12:22,198
[SPEAKER_21]: If you didn't already outplay it.

160
00:12:22,258 --> 00:12:23,559
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie, have you even seen Max 2 yet?

161
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,520
[SPEAKER_21]: Who cares?

162
00:12:26,401 --> 00:12:28,262
[SPEAKER_21]: I have it too, so I've played it all too.

163
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:30,304
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you have your mic over there, Jamie?

164
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:33,286
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie doesn't care she doesn't have a mic.

165
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:35,662
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

166
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:36,963
[SPEAKER_18]: I bought Max 2 also.

167
00:12:37,043 --> 00:12:37,903
[SPEAKER_18]: What did you think of Max 2?

168
00:12:37,943 --> 00:12:38,944
[SPEAKER_18]: It was pretty good.

169
00:12:40,565 --> 00:12:42,706
[SPEAKER_18]: There's lots of songs.

170
00:12:43,526 --> 00:12:46,608
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to get Kingdom Hearts Final Mix before I get Max 2.

171
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:48,269
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

172
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:51,338
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie, you need to keep that microphone.

173
00:12:51,378 --> 00:12:52,739
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh wait, no, I see Bradley has it.

174
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,500
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why you don't have it.

175
00:12:55,921 --> 00:12:58,242
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie's playing with the chat room.

176
00:12:58,262 --> 00:13:00,223
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, let's talk to Bradley about Max 2.

177
00:13:00,504 --> 00:13:00,844
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry.

178
00:13:01,704 --> 00:13:03,406
[SPEAKER_18]: There's lots of songs like 70-something.

179
00:13:03,846 --> 00:13:05,627
[SPEAKER_18]: Because a lot of them are the Oni songs.

180
00:13:05,647 --> 00:13:09,930
[SPEAKER_18]: You have to actually play them in an Oni before you can unlock them for regular play.

181
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,312
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you hear about the really cheap trick you can use to unlock all the Oni songs really fast?

182
00:13:14,196 --> 00:13:14,616
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I didn't.

183
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:18,019
[SPEAKER_21]: All you do, you go into Create Your Own Oni Course, right?

184
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:18,379
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

185
00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:20,240
[SPEAKER_21]: And you set all your songs to roulette.

186
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:30,566
[SPEAKER_21]: And then the steps, because you can set the level of steps you'll get on roulette, basic, middle, or basic trick, maniac, light, standard, heavy, whatever it is.

187
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:31,367
[SPEAKER_21]: Challenge, yeah.

188
00:13:32,227 --> 00:13:33,088
[SPEAKER_21]: I hate how they change that.

189
00:13:33,108 --> 00:13:34,909
[SPEAKER_21]: They will forever be trick and maniac to me, damn it.

190
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:38,131
[SPEAKER_21]: You set them all to challenge, and then that way you'll only get the challenge songs.

191
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:42,754
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, yeah, they're forever going to be, you know, SSR and whatever.

192
00:13:42,774 --> 00:13:43,114
[SPEAKER_21]: Whatever.

193
00:13:44,675 --> 00:13:46,856
[SPEAKER_21]: No one can hear that over here.

194
00:13:47,656 --> 00:13:56,400
[SPEAKER_21]: You put it on light, and then you can... So you can put all your songs on, like, 1.5 speed solo light challenge mode, and you'll have all your challenge songs in, like, under an hour.

195
00:13:56,881 --> 00:13:57,361
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's easy.

196
00:13:57,801 --> 00:13:58,041
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah.

197
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,603
[SPEAKER_21]: That was the only way... You did the hard way.

198
00:14:00,623 --> 00:14:01,263
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you get them all?

199
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:01,703
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

200
00:14:01,923 --> 00:14:02,323
[SPEAKER_21]: Dang.

201
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,126
[SPEAKER_21]: Dropout, right?

202
00:14:08,787 --> 00:14:09,007
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought...

203
00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:14,950
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, because it's the first stage.

204
00:14:20,497 --> 00:14:20,797
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, okay.

205
00:14:20,937 --> 00:14:22,279
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, that's kind of the same idea.

206
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:23,901
[SPEAKER_20]: Random course is evil.

207
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:25,503
[SPEAKER_21]: Random course is evil.

208
00:14:28,337 --> 00:14:39,763
[SPEAKER_21]: It's an interesting feature to add to DDR, though, where you can... Basically, the random-owning course now selects any song at random, any difficulty, well, pretty much only Trick and Maniac are the only ones that... I don't know, what did you get that one to?

209
00:14:39,783 --> 00:14:40,783
[SPEAKER_20]: You got, uh, what was it?

210
00:14:40,843 --> 00:14:42,004
[SPEAKER_20]: Burning Heat Heavy 8-Speed.

211
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:45,726
[SPEAKER_21]: I got Burning Heat Heavy 8-Speed Boost.

212
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:47,407
[SPEAKER_21]: I was so pissed.

213
00:14:54,494 --> 00:15:02,856
[SPEAKER_21]: And then, of course, we have beaten the course, or I should say Brad did, because Brad was over here, and he played the course, and he was getting four, oh wait, how many songs did he have to play?

214
00:15:02,896 --> 00:15:03,496
[SPEAKER_21]: Five or six?

215
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:03,856
[SPEAKER_21]: I forget.

216
00:15:03,876 --> 00:15:04,456
[SPEAKER_21]: I think six.

217
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:06,757
[SPEAKER_21]: Four of them were standard songs.

218
00:15:07,737 --> 00:15:11,218
[SPEAKER_21]: And, like, the hardest modifier he got was Sudden on one of the standard songs.

219
00:15:11,318 --> 00:15:12,818
[SPEAKER_21]: He got a Sudden on one of the standard songs.

220
00:15:13,118 --> 00:15:17,619
[SPEAKER_21]: And the rest was like, ooh, you know, it was like, ooh, I might have to play Two Speed or something.

221
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:18,520
[SPEAKER_21]: It was sick.

222
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,720
[SPEAKER_21]: He makes me mad.

223
00:15:21,372 --> 00:15:27,835
[SPEAKER_17]: I had five pretty regular ones, and then the last one was the AM3P Remix.

224
00:15:27,935 --> 00:15:30,776
[SPEAKER_17]: It was like 3x, thin, reverse, less flat, or combination.

225
00:15:42,043 --> 00:15:47,805
[SPEAKER_21]: I find what I like most about, um, it's just weird that the sound just changed right there.

226
00:15:49,486 --> 00:15:51,767
[SPEAKER_21]: Are we still, hold on, I'm gonna make sure we're still going.

227
00:15:53,407 --> 00:15:54,287
[SPEAKER_21]: Something got unplugged.

228
00:15:56,668 --> 00:15:56,968
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello?

229
00:15:57,068 --> 00:15:57,309
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello?

230
00:15:57,409 --> 00:15:58,309
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, they can still hear us.

231
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:00,390
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, but it got louder all of a sudden.

232
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,991
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I don't know what happened.

233
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:04,651
[SPEAKER_21]: We got louder.

234
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:05,291
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh well.

235
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,332
[SPEAKER_20]: Normally it means something got unplugged.

236
00:16:08,953 --> 00:16:09,593
[SPEAKER_20]: How you doing, Bradley?

237
00:16:09,613 --> 00:16:09,753
[SPEAKER_20]: Bradley?

238
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,385
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll fix it.

239
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:12,866
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you hear me?

240
00:16:13,227 --> 00:16:17,556
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we can hear everybody, so... Hello, anyone out there?

241
00:16:17,696 --> 00:16:18,197
[SPEAKER_21]: That was weird.

242
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:19,039
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, whatever.

243
00:16:20,502 --> 00:16:21,303
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, where were we?

244
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:25,441
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, you're talking about Max 2 for Japanese system.

245
00:16:26,522 --> 00:16:31,845
[SPEAKER_21]: I think, I actually, what I like most about Max 2 is, like, I like those Oni course songs.

246
00:16:31,965 --> 00:16:35,148
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, they're, it's kind of neat to be able to play them at home whenever you want.

247
00:16:35,988 --> 00:16:40,131
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I was playing a lot of those on Extreme, and now I can play them at home.

248
00:16:40,551 --> 00:16:43,073
[SPEAKER_21]: But what sucks is that they didn't add any new steps to them.

249
00:16:43,793 --> 00:16:44,934
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just the challenge steps.

250
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,474
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

251
00:17:08,703 --> 00:17:10,404
[SPEAKER_20]: They've gotten licensed songs from the get-go.

252
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:11,965
[SPEAKER_20]: We've gotten fucked every single time.

253
00:17:12,806 --> 00:17:16,848
[SPEAKER_20]: Except for Max USA, and they're like, oh, here you go, licensed songs.

254
00:17:17,128 --> 00:17:18,089
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, gee, it's about time.

255
00:17:18,129 --> 00:17:19,750
[SPEAKER_20]: You're only like, you know, two mixes behind.

256
00:17:20,851 --> 00:17:27,035
[SPEAKER_21]: What's going to be interesting, though, is the news, and that'll be a big show when we hear when B3's over, what comes out of that.

257
00:17:28,155 --> 00:17:29,316
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, that is a microphone, Jamie.

258
00:17:29,476 --> 00:17:30,357
[SPEAKER_21]: You like that one, don't you?

259
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:33,079
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a condenser mic.

260
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,299
[SPEAKER_20]: I just need a mic sting.

261
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,301
[SPEAKER_20]: That's going to be the one that's going to record background noise.

262
00:17:37,902 --> 00:17:38,282
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, goody.

263
00:17:42,273 --> 00:17:44,695
[SPEAKER_21]: Hmm.

264
00:17:45,596 --> 00:17:47,577
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie's getting all angsty over her pot pie.

265
00:17:49,939 --> 00:17:50,659
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki, what are you doing?

266
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,761
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm seeing this on TV.

267
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:54,602
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to turn on the TV during the show?

268
00:17:55,503 --> 00:17:55,963
[SPEAKER_21]: Hell yeah.

269
00:17:56,424 --> 00:17:59,006
[SPEAKER_21]: You need to get a VCR so you don't get so easily distracted.

270
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,108
[SPEAKER_21]: You're watching The Weakest Link.

271
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,152
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you guys forget we do a radio show Sunday nights?

272
00:18:07,172 --> 00:18:07,232
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

273
00:18:11,414 --> 00:18:12,654
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm turning the channel.

274
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,315
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to go back to... Why are we watching Game Show Network?

275
00:18:15,475 --> 00:18:16,655
[SPEAKER_21]: I was watching the Game Show Network.

276
00:18:16,675 --> 00:18:18,215
[SPEAKER_21]: I was watching $100,000 Pyramid.

277
00:18:18,455 --> 00:18:19,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, I saw the coolest game.

278
00:18:20,096 --> 00:18:20,316
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

279
00:18:20,736 --> 00:18:22,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Who Wants to Beat Up a Millionaire.

280
00:18:22,896 --> 00:18:25,077
[SPEAKER_21]: On Dreamcast.

281
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,157
[SPEAKER_21]: That's hella old.

282
00:18:26,197 --> 00:18:27,677
[SPEAKER_21]: That was like an old, old Dreamcast game.

283
00:18:27,697 --> 00:18:29,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but I didn't pay attention to the crap games.

284
00:18:30,578 --> 00:18:31,198
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you buy it?

285
00:18:31,418 --> 00:18:31,698
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

286
00:18:32,238 --> 00:18:32,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Ross is playing it.

287
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:34,978
[SPEAKER_21]: How does it work?

288
00:18:35,718 --> 00:18:38,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Your question right, you get to beat up a millionaire for money.

289
00:18:41,585 --> 00:18:43,646
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki's trying to figure out how to use digital cable right now.

290
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,246
[SPEAKER_21]: We're stuck on the weakest link right now.

291
00:18:45,266 --> 00:18:46,106
[SPEAKER_20]: When are you getting TiVo?

292
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,087
[SPEAKER_21]: So slow.

293
00:18:47,107 --> 00:18:49,427
[SPEAKER_21]: We're getting TiVo when I'm not ghetto poor anymore, Jamie.

294
00:18:50,908 --> 00:18:51,388
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, 5-5?

295
00:18:51,648 --> 00:18:56,770
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean... I know how to do this.

296
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,230
[SPEAKER_20]: Shut up.

297
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:02,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, so... This is an interesting perspective here.

298
00:19:03,512 --> 00:19:03,892
[SPEAKER_21]: How so?

299
00:19:04,192 --> 00:19:06,033
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in front of the computer this time.

300
00:19:06,113 --> 00:19:07,613
[SPEAKER_20]: I think this is the A-team.

301
00:19:08,373 --> 00:19:09,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Whoa, the A-team is cool.

302
00:19:09,254 --> 00:19:10,634
[SPEAKER_21]: No, it's Thunderball, uncut.

303
00:19:11,229 --> 00:19:11,349
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh.

304
00:19:11,949 --> 00:19:14,750
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you turn it down for us or mute it until your show's on or whatever?

305
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:16,411
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't want to watch this anyways.

306
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:18,652
[SPEAKER_20]: I thought that most extreme elimination challenge is going to be on.

307
00:19:18,772 --> 00:19:19,132
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck this.

308
00:19:21,273 --> 00:19:22,414
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you want to put in Max 2?

309
00:19:22,474 --> 00:19:23,954
[SPEAKER_21]: We can play a little Max 2 on air.

310
00:19:25,155 --> 00:19:26,415
[SPEAKER_21]: Show off our new equipment.

311
00:19:26,435 --> 00:19:30,117
[SPEAKER_08]: See, that's really going to do good for the listeners because they can just hear the music.

312
00:19:30,137 --> 00:19:33,138
[SPEAKER_08]: And hear, oh, you're doing shitty.

313
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:35,305
[SPEAKER_20]: Whoa, another AAA.

314
00:19:35,326 --> 00:19:37,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't you try practicing in a closet?

315
00:19:38,087 --> 00:19:39,028
[SPEAKER_20]: I just kick ass.

316
00:19:39,088 --> 00:19:40,348
[SPEAKER_20]: Another AAA again?

317
00:19:40,468 --> 00:19:41,129
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh my god.

318
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:42,730
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm gonna do this blindfold.

319
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,890
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, look, another AAA.

320
00:19:44,611 --> 00:19:45,051
[SPEAKER_20]: Come on.

321
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:46,392
[SPEAKER_08]: What the fuck is this?

322
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:49,694
[SPEAKER_09]: Ghost in the Shell movie CD?

323
00:19:53,356 --> 00:20:02,741
[SPEAKER_21]: Remember, like, before CDs, when they used to sell, like, movie CDs at CompUSA, where you could, like, it was on, like, two CDs, and it was just basically one giant AVI file or something?

324
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:03,522
[SPEAKER_08]: You mean it's a VCD.

325
00:20:04,358 --> 00:20:05,939
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, there's Final Fuck X.

326
00:20:27,822 --> 00:20:28,923
[SPEAKER_07]: I burned that for you.

327
00:20:29,423 --> 00:20:30,404
[SPEAKER_21]: All the porn's behind me.

328
00:20:31,245 --> 00:20:33,106
[SPEAKER_21]: Should we look through some of Loki's interesting porn?

329
00:20:33,586 --> 00:20:34,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, let's watch porn.

330
00:20:34,787 --> 00:20:35,888
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you want to put on some porn?

331
00:20:36,229 --> 00:20:36,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, why not?

332
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:37,630
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to watch something funny.

333
00:20:39,131 --> 00:20:39,871
[SPEAKER_09]: I need comedy.

334
00:20:40,091 --> 00:20:42,693
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's go back to the Orange Lounge Radio roots and watch some porn.

335
00:20:45,335 --> 00:20:46,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, it's comedy.

336
00:20:46,096 --> 00:20:46,536
[SPEAKER_21]: This is great.

337
00:20:46,777 --> 00:20:47,957
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm loving this new facility.

338
00:20:48,278 --> 00:20:50,039
[SPEAKER_21]: Now we don't just have to talk about porn.

339
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:51,420
[SPEAKER_21]: We can watch porn.

340
00:21:00,449 --> 00:21:01,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Jackal and Hyde.

341
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:05,330
[SPEAKER_21]: Wait, let's talk, let's take a chat room vote.

342
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,411
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie, can you monitor the chat room?

343
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you have the bad anime one.

344
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,851
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you monitor the chat room, Jamie, and see which one of these they want to watch?

345
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:13,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'm just going to go by based on biggest response.

346
00:21:13,612 --> 00:21:14,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Hand me that big stack.

347
00:21:14,592 --> 00:21:16,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, let me... Loki, hand me your big stack.

348
00:21:19,413 --> 00:21:20,414
[SPEAKER_18]: Stack overflow.

349
00:21:22,554 --> 00:21:24,454
[SPEAKER_21]: We have The Watcher 3.

350
00:21:25,595 --> 00:21:27,175
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, it's Mirage's first anal.

351
00:21:28,547 --> 00:21:32,790
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see, we have DNA Hunter, Volume 1, totally uncensored.

352
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,812
[SPEAKER_21]: This is animated, but it's voiced by adult stars.

353
00:21:37,234 --> 00:21:40,896
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, chat room, since there's a little lag, you're going to have to type the name of the porno that you want to see.

354
00:21:41,497 --> 00:21:42,538
[SPEAKER_21]: Really loud, so Jamie sees.

355
00:21:42,758 --> 00:21:43,578
[SPEAKER_21]: This one's lame.

356
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:46,140
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, it's Jenna Jameson in Cruise in Jennaville.

357
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,081
[SPEAKER_21]: It kind of looks lame.

358
00:21:47,161 --> 00:21:50,223
[SPEAKER_20]: It's one of those stupid softcore, like, I'm getting naked and touching myself things.

359
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:51,344
[SPEAKER_20]: Really retarded.

360
00:21:52,225 --> 00:21:53,326
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't have any gay porn, huh?

361
00:21:53,886 --> 00:21:54,467
[SPEAKER_21]: I used to.

362
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:56,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I have that one you gave me in my trunk.

363
00:21:57,879 --> 00:22:00,301
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, that's right, there's a gay porn out, yeah, in the trunk.

364
00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:03,723
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so we have, we have a random gay porn we can watch, too.

365
00:22:05,184 --> 00:22:06,004
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, let's see, what's this?

366
00:22:06,745 --> 00:22:08,786
[SPEAKER_21]: Karen, totally uncensored.

367
00:22:08,806 --> 00:22:10,547
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, you think this show's gone to the toilet?

368
00:22:10,587 --> 00:22:11,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we don't care what you think.

369
00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:16,290
[SPEAKER_21]: Jekyll and Hyde, with multiple angles.

370
00:22:17,251 --> 00:22:17,431
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh!

371
00:22:17,491 --> 00:22:18,132
[SPEAKER_20]: Multiple angles.

372
00:22:19,032 --> 00:22:19,452
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see.

373
00:22:20,133 --> 00:22:22,194
[SPEAKER_21]: Real wild girls out of control.

374
00:22:22,234 --> 00:22:23,615
[SPEAKER_20]: Gravitation is not porn.

375
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:25,676
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the Winter Ghetto version of Girls Gone Wild.

376
00:22:25,876 --> 00:22:26,817
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just horrible.

377
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:29,955
[SPEAKER_20]: That's actually pretty good.

378
00:22:29,995 --> 00:22:30,935
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think there's anything in there.

379
00:22:31,015 --> 00:22:32,036
[SPEAKER_21]: No, there is.

380
00:22:32,776 --> 00:22:33,636
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a Playboy disc.

381
00:22:33,836 --> 00:22:37,517
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there isn't anything in there.

382
00:22:37,697 --> 00:22:40,497
[SPEAKER_21]: Instead of Sailor Moon, it's Sailor and the Seven Balls.

383
00:22:41,018 --> 00:22:44,498
[SPEAKER_20]: Awful, awful, awful animation.

384
00:22:44,598 --> 00:22:45,078
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm curious.

385
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:45,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me see that.

386
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:47,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me borrow that.

387
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:51,160
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to see how bad it is.

388
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,880
[SPEAKER_21]: Sex and the Stranger.

389
00:22:57,071 --> 00:22:58,457
[SPEAKER_20]: Also, some of them have two DVDs.

390
00:22:58,538 --> 00:23:00,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Never mind, this looks really stupid.

391
00:23:00,707 --> 00:23:01,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Couples.

392
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:03,460
[SPEAKER_09]: This looks more than stupid.

393
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Treasure Hunt.

394
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,002
[SPEAKER_07]: This looks like it was done in Flash.

395
00:23:06,562 --> 00:23:07,803
[SPEAKER_20]: That was done in Flash.

396
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:10,485
[SPEAKER_21]: It's an erotic paradise and ten million dollars.

397
00:23:10,985 --> 00:23:13,086
[SPEAKER_21]: Only one catch, you gotta live to collect.

398
00:23:13,427 --> 00:23:15,928
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's like porn and they beat each other up.

399
00:23:15,948 --> 00:23:18,510
[SPEAKER_20]: No one wants to see this either, it's softcore crap.

400
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,051
[SPEAKER_20]: I just kind of put them all.

401
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:22,393
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, the rest is, oh, no, it's softcore too.

402
00:23:23,413 --> 00:23:25,635
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, the rest is good.

403
00:23:25,775 --> 00:23:27,196
[SPEAKER_21]: A Heat for All Seasons.

404
00:23:27,436 --> 00:23:30,218
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a fairly popular hentai, if I'm not mistaken.

405
00:23:33,128 --> 00:23:38,413
[SPEAKER_21]: Nubian Nurse Orgy Nubian?

406
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:40,274
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I think that wins.

407
00:23:40,815 --> 00:23:43,297
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so we have Nubian Nurse Orgy in the lead.

408
00:23:44,358 --> 00:23:45,459
[SPEAKER_21]: Hurry up, because I'm bored.

409
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,901
[SPEAKER_21]: Interactive Mind Teaser.

410
00:23:48,001 --> 00:23:48,661
[SPEAKER_21]: That sounds stupid.

411
00:23:48,681 --> 00:23:49,302
[SPEAKER_20]: That's an actual game.

412
00:23:49,322 --> 00:23:51,264
[SPEAKER_20]: You have to do work to get naked pictures in that one.

413
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,805
[SPEAKER_21]: Ooh, and then Seven Deadly Sins.

414
00:23:53,706 --> 00:23:54,266
[SPEAKER_20]: That one's funny.

415
00:23:55,787 --> 00:23:57,389
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, we're going to watch Nubian Nurse Orgy.

416
00:23:57,429 --> 00:23:58,610
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't care what the chatroom thinks.

417
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,572
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

418
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:03,196
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, then they lose.

419
00:24:04,337 --> 00:24:05,958
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, we don't have a DVD player hooked up, do we?

420
00:24:07,499 --> 00:24:08,560
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, we'll have to get that.

421
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:12,864
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, that'll be something we can look forward to after the break then, is Nubian Nurse Orgy.

422
00:24:13,684 --> 00:24:13,865
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

423
00:24:26,118 --> 00:24:28,499
[SPEAKER_21]: Actually, we have a stand-alone DVD player somewhere.

424
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,500
[SPEAKER_21]: At least I had one the other day.

425
00:24:30,941 --> 00:24:31,521
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you find it?

426
00:24:33,002 --> 00:24:33,202
[SPEAKER_21]: Good.

427
00:24:33,382 --> 00:24:34,123
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a DVD player.

428
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:36,364
[SPEAKER_21]: So we have that to look for.

429
00:24:36,424 --> 00:24:38,665
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, the carpeting in here is pink.

430
00:24:38,746 --> 00:24:39,406
[SPEAKER_21]: Isn't it lovely?

431
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:50,112
[SPEAKER_21]: So, Jamie, you bought yourself a book the other day.

432
00:24:50,492 --> 00:24:51,073
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I did.

433
00:24:51,213 --> 00:24:51,793
[SPEAKER_21]: What did you buy?

434
00:24:52,193 --> 00:24:52,934
[SPEAKER_21]: Battle Royale.

435
00:24:53,394 --> 00:24:54,055
[SPEAKER_21]: It's about time.

436
00:24:54,155 --> 00:24:54,555
[SPEAKER_21]: How is it?

437
00:24:55,439 --> 00:24:57,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I bought it two days ago.

438
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,162
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is just reading it in the bathroom.

439
00:25:02,442 --> 00:25:04,123
[SPEAKER_21]: So you're about a quarter of the way, about?

440
00:25:04,943 --> 00:25:06,084
[SPEAKER_21]: No, maybe about a fifth.

441
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:07,204
[SPEAKER_21]: How many kids are still alive?

442
00:25:08,585 --> 00:25:08,945
[SPEAKER_21]: Girl, hold on.

443
00:25:11,586 --> 00:25:13,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the chapter's in with the body count.

444
00:25:13,487 --> 00:25:14,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, 30 students removed.

445
00:25:15,828 --> 00:25:17,549
[SPEAKER_21]: So, a quarter of them are down, basically.

446
00:25:17,569 --> 00:25:18,650
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

447
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:18,910
[SPEAKER_21]: Nice.

448
00:25:22,991 --> 00:25:23,912
Oh my god, the best.

449
00:25:25,031 --> 00:25:31,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

450
00:25:35,794 --> 00:25:36,054
[SPEAKER_21]: Hmm.

451
00:25:37,054 --> 00:25:37,615
[SPEAKER_21]: Kind of gross.

452
00:25:37,815 --> 00:25:38,975
[SPEAKER_08]: And they all eat the cookies.

453
00:25:41,056 --> 00:25:42,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Shuya got to have the cookies.

454
00:25:46,437 --> 00:25:48,578
[SPEAKER_21]: Anything else going on in the Bomani world, Loki?

455
00:25:48,618 --> 00:25:50,258
[SPEAKER_21]: What's new in Sim Land?

456
00:25:50,858 --> 00:25:51,718
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there anything new in Sim Land?

457
00:25:51,738 --> 00:25:53,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Let him hook up the DVD player first.

458
00:25:55,171 --> 00:25:55,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Jeez, Rob.

459
00:25:56,594 --> 00:25:56,994
[SPEAKER_21]: Jeez.

460
00:25:57,074 --> 00:25:57,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Crack that whip.

461
00:25:58,457 --> 00:26:01,643
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, I forgot for a minute that we're not a Bomani show.

462
00:26:03,673 --> 00:26:05,314
[SPEAKER_08]: I have something new in the Bitmoney world.

463
00:26:05,574 --> 00:26:05,774
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

464
00:26:06,054 --> 00:26:07,734
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't played any Bitmoney in a week.

465
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:10,215
[SPEAKER_21]: Congratulations.

466
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:10,856
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I played 2DX.

467
00:26:10,876 --> 00:26:11,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you?

468
00:26:11,956 --> 00:26:13,837
[SPEAKER_08]: You saw me beat Last Message twice in a row.

469
00:26:13,857 --> 00:26:14,097
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

470
00:26:14,137 --> 00:26:15,297
[SPEAKER_21]: You're beating Seven Stars now.

471
00:26:15,697 --> 00:26:15,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

472
00:26:16,057 --> 00:26:17,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you beat another one, too?

473
00:26:17,078 --> 00:26:17,118
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

474
00:26:17,538 --> 00:26:18,558
[SPEAKER_08]: You beat Please Don't Go, right?

475
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:19,058
[SPEAKER_08]: I beat Please Don't Go.

476
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:19,799
[SPEAKER_08]: That was my first one.

477
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:20,919
[SPEAKER_08]: My second one was Monkey Dance.

478
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:21,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

479
00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:26,461
[SPEAKER_08]: I've beaten Nine O'Clocks, but it was on Easy, and I border bonused, so it doesn't count.

480
00:26:26,581 --> 00:26:27,001
[SPEAKER_21]: Doesn't count.

481
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:29,202
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

482
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:32,486
[SPEAKER_08]: I've sort of... I haven't been... You know, it's weird.

483
00:26:32,546 --> 00:26:36,348
[SPEAKER_21]: It's hard to get back into the swing of things right now because I honestly feel like we haven't done a show in a month.

484
00:26:36,748 --> 00:26:40,671
[SPEAKER_21]: And then to come back and do a show here, like at a brand new place, it's weird.

485
00:26:40,731 --> 00:26:44,053
[SPEAKER_21]: It doesn't even... It doesn't feel... It doesn't... Yeah, it doesn't feel serious right now.

486
00:26:44,093 --> 00:26:49,696
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe it's going to take us until our... until our Season 3 premiere, until we feel serious.

487
00:26:54,819 --> 00:26:55,439
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, that's right.

488
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,442
[SPEAKER_21]: We now... I remember that.

489
00:27:07,343 --> 00:27:14,845
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I remember I used to have those little Sesame Street books, and I would get the little records, and you could play on the record player, and it would go, and now, turn the page.

490
00:27:15,146 --> 00:27:16,846
[SPEAKER_21]: And it made the little chime, and you could turn the page.

491
00:27:17,006 --> 00:27:17,226
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

492
00:27:18,527 --> 00:27:19,447
[SPEAKER_18]: I had Garfield ones.

493
00:27:19,487 --> 00:27:19,907
[SPEAKER_18]: Those were cool.

494
00:27:19,927 --> 00:27:29,511
[SPEAKER_18]: And the hardest one to find was...

495
00:27:31,994 --> 00:27:33,415
[SPEAKER_21]: We might want to pull the blinds.

496
00:27:35,897 --> 00:27:37,979
[SPEAKER_21]: Because that's the last thing we need are more complaints.

497
00:27:43,184 --> 00:27:45,686
[SPEAKER_21]: Now they're going to wonder what we do in here.

498
00:27:54,594 --> 00:27:55,214
[SPEAKER_21]: Porn is funny.

499
00:27:55,394 --> 00:27:56,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Porn is comedy.

500
00:27:56,555 --> 00:27:58,317
[SPEAKER_21]: Wait, so are we going to take a break and then do porn?

501
00:27:58,337 --> 00:27:59,578
[SPEAKER_09]: They said turn on the freaking mic.

502
00:28:00,322 --> 00:28:03,403
[SPEAKER_21]: The mics are on.

503
00:28:03,963 --> 00:28:04,523
[SPEAKER_21]: Watch our audio.

504
00:28:04,563 --> 00:28:05,624
[SPEAKER_21]: Make sure we have audio going out.

505
00:28:07,565 --> 00:28:08,485
[SPEAKER_07]: La, la, la.

506
00:28:08,805 --> 00:28:10,546
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we freaking have them on.

507
00:28:16,668 --> 00:28:17,988
[SPEAKER_21]: They keep cutting out or something?

508
00:28:18,008 --> 00:28:20,269
[SPEAKER_21]: Bring up the studio broadcaster.

509
00:28:25,006 --> 00:28:28,789
[SPEAKER_21]: and then when you just keep an eye on that and make sure we don't drop.

510
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,612
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this one is unconnected at the bottom.

511
00:28:32,992 --> 00:28:34,894
[SPEAKER_08]: It's unconnecting.

512
00:28:37,196 --> 00:28:39,177
[SPEAKER_20]: That explains why our volume keeps jumping.

513
00:28:40,838 --> 00:28:41,679
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, just one sec.

514
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:42,119
[SPEAKER_20]: No one talk.

515
00:28:53,709 --> 00:28:54,129
[SPEAKER_20]: Dead air.

516
00:28:57,895 --> 00:28:58,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.

517
00:28:58,696 --> 00:28:59,016
[SPEAKER_20]: Hello.

518
00:28:59,496 --> 00:29:00,137
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, we're good.

519
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:04,540
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, maybe not.

520
00:29:08,443 --> 00:29:11,145
[SPEAKER_21]: Boy, this is the greatest episode of Orange Lounge Radio ever.

521
00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:25,796
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, well, I still see that we're getting... I have to check on your pot pie?

522
00:29:25,956 --> 00:29:26,236
[SPEAKER_21]: Fine.

523
00:29:27,642 --> 00:29:37,709
[SPEAKER_21]: Your pot pie has... Maybe we should go to music.

524
00:29:38,629 --> 00:29:39,910
[SPEAKER_21]: 15 minutes for your pot pie.

525
00:29:40,991 --> 00:29:43,312
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, let's go to music right now.

526
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:44,413
[SPEAKER_21]: Now's a good time to break.

527
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:52,639
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, what?

528
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:53,479
[SPEAKER_21]: What do you want me to say?

529
00:29:57,102 --> 00:29:57,382
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi.

530
00:29:58,584 --> 00:29:58,644
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi.

531
00:29:58,744 --> 00:30:01,566
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello, hello, hello, hello.

532
00:30:01,586 --> 00:30:06,269
[SPEAKER_21]: You gotta go to C, C colon, and then Orange Lounge.

533
00:30:06,289 --> 00:30:07,670
[SPEAKER_18]: Echo, echo.

534
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:12,659
[SPEAKER_21]: B3?

535
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,801
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah, B3's coming up, that'll be fun, that's in two weeks.

536
00:30:16,141 --> 00:30:30,127
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, we have, this weekend is episode 43, next weekend's episode 44, then we have the week after that, the 17th and the 18th, we have B3, which is this huge tournament that's happening at the Riptide Arcade in San Francisco, which I went to for the first time this week, by the way.

537
00:30:30,867 --> 00:30:32,208
[SPEAKER_21]: It's pretty nifty.

538
00:30:32,368 --> 00:30:37,610
[SPEAKER_21]: If I remember right, a lot of the flooring is wood, so it feels like you're playing video games on a pier, so it's interesting.

539
00:30:38,731 --> 00:30:40,952
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, because you are, because you're on the pier and playing an arcade, but...

540
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:48,515
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, about four songs.

541
00:30:48,795 --> 00:30:54,019
[SPEAKER_21]: So we have B3 and we're going to be broadcasting live from B3 all day long, Saturday and Sunday.

542
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,602
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you think this is interesting radio, wait till you hear that.

543
00:30:58,522 --> 00:31:03,185
[SPEAKER_21]: Hopefully you guys were listening during our March Madness broadcast or if you remember way back to the Shaft broadcast.

544
00:31:05,127 --> 00:31:08,749
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll talk more about B3 and all that after the break when we get some more mics hooked up.

545
00:31:08,829 --> 00:31:09,470
[SPEAKER_21]: So we'll be back.

546
00:32:18,785 --> 00:32:20,128
Thanks for watching!

547
00:36:10,491 --> 00:36:11,835
Thanks for watching!

548
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:15,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio with the Ping Pong Balls.

549
00:37:19,385 --> 00:37:20,486
[SPEAKER_21]: We're back.

550
00:37:21,547 --> 00:37:22,988
[SPEAKER_21]: And you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

551
00:37:23,528 --> 00:37:26,550
[SPEAKER_08]: I felt the urge to do that brand dance.

552
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:27,750
[SPEAKER_21]: The brand dance?

553
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:28,071
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

554
00:37:28,711 --> 00:37:29,391
[SPEAKER_21]: During Night in Motion?

555
00:37:29,612 --> 00:37:29,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

556
00:37:30,732 --> 00:37:31,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

557
00:37:31,793 --> 00:37:34,354
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess many people probably don't get that.

558
00:37:35,515 --> 00:37:36,456
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you tell the story then?

559
00:37:36,476 --> 00:37:36,916
[SPEAKER_21]: I wasn't there.

560
00:37:36,936 --> 00:37:38,217
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what I was doing.

561
00:37:40,661 --> 00:37:45,324
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember, though, everyone at AX 2001, I think it was.

562
00:37:46,705 --> 00:37:47,385
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a tournament.

563
00:37:47,585 --> 00:37:48,846
[SPEAKER_08]: See, I wasn't there for the tournament either.

564
00:37:48,886 --> 00:37:49,927
[SPEAKER_08]: I just decided not to do it.

565
00:37:50,407 --> 00:37:55,070
[SPEAKER_08]: But everyone for freestyle for the post-qualifiers got up there and did Night in Motion.

566
00:37:55,991 --> 00:37:56,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody did.

567
00:37:57,592 --> 00:37:58,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Got up there and did Night in Motion.

568
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:00,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

569
00:38:02,194 --> 00:38:04,156
[SPEAKER_08]: My pot pie is taunting me.

570
00:38:06,297 --> 00:38:07,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob's tweaking with a thingy.

571
00:38:09,144 --> 00:38:09,604
[SPEAKER_08]: He's pinching it.

572
00:38:09,624 --> 00:38:10,925
[SPEAKER_21]: He's trying to make one of the mics a little louder.

573
00:38:10,945 --> 00:38:12,086
[SPEAKER_08]: He's trying to make it get decided.

574
00:38:14,787 --> 00:38:15,768
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't need to be loud!

575
00:38:15,788 --> 00:38:23,212
[SPEAKER_07]: See, Rob needs the one where he needs to have his volume down.

576
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you need to turn mine down.

577
00:38:25,394 --> 00:38:26,354
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a voice that carries.

578
00:38:29,456 --> 00:38:33,458
[SPEAKER_21]: So, hey, Loki reminded me during the break of a Bomani topic.

579
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:35,960
[SPEAKER_21]: You remember how DDR's coming out for the Xbox?

580
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,060
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

581
00:38:37,259 --> 00:38:38,140
[SPEAKER_08]: You mean that bullshit?

582
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:43,625
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, well, they have the first screenshot out now, and it looks like Drop the Bomb is going to be in it.

583
00:38:44,185 --> 00:38:45,386
[SPEAKER_08]: I still think that's bullshit.

584
00:38:46,227 --> 00:38:46,908
[SPEAKER_21]: How's it bullshit?

585
00:38:47,488 --> 00:38:49,770
[SPEAKER_08]: I still think that it's a big bullshit hoax.

586
00:38:51,271 --> 00:38:52,392
[SPEAKER_21]: You think DDR on X?

587
00:38:54,014 --> 00:38:54,995
[SPEAKER_21]: What are you doing, Loki?

588
00:38:55,635 --> 00:38:56,896
[SPEAKER_20]: I was getting on my internet.

589
00:38:57,257 --> 00:39:00,399
[SPEAKER_20]: I forgot that the sound from mine... Sorry.

590
00:39:05,495 --> 00:39:06,575
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, that's, you know why?

591
00:39:06,955 --> 00:39:17,057
[SPEAKER_20]: Because a certain somebody who was on the internet looking up address directions had their cable hooked up to that one and not mine, so I couldn't hook it up because we don't know how to use the router and we suck.

592
00:39:19,978 --> 00:39:21,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I can set up your router.

593
00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:24,939
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, not now, because we're doing a show.

594
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,560
[SPEAKER_21]: You still think, you think DDR on Xbox is still a big hoax?

595
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,140
[SPEAKER_21]: There's an official press release.

596
00:39:32,721 --> 00:39:34,541
[SPEAKER_21]: There's an official press release on it, okay.

597
00:39:35,342 --> 00:39:37,122
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't say it was a hoax, I said it's crap.

598
00:39:37,262 --> 00:39:37,902
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, it's crap.

599
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:39,283
[SPEAKER_20]: That I concur.

600
00:39:41,123 --> 00:39:42,283
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm probably going to have it.

601
00:39:42,823 --> 00:39:45,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we get all this stuff that they put out for Xbox because they send it to us for free.

602
00:39:46,024 --> 00:39:46,564
[SPEAKER_20]: That's cool.

603
00:39:47,524 --> 00:39:49,904
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I'm not buying an Xbox for it.

604
00:39:49,924 --> 00:39:50,985
[SPEAKER_20]: They think that I'm doing that.

605
00:39:51,265 --> 00:39:55,205
[SPEAKER_20]: The only way I'd ever buy an Xbox is if they came out with Mario Kart for the Xbox.

606
00:39:55,605 --> 00:39:58,246
[SPEAKER_20]: But since that'll never ever happen, I don't need an Xbox.

607
00:39:59,486 --> 00:40:02,026
[SPEAKER_21]: However, Mario Kart Double Dash, oh yeah.

608
00:40:02,407 --> 00:40:05,127
[SPEAKER_21]: But they don't have Mario Kart on the PS2 and you have one of those.

609
00:40:06,263 --> 00:40:08,645
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, but that's because I needed Final Fantasy 8.

610
00:40:10,747 --> 00:40:12,168
[SPEAKER_21]: Final Fantasy 8 was PS1, not PS2.

611
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,210
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, that's because I needed Final Fantasy 10.

612
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,070
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, okay.

613
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,352
[SPEAKER_20]: What did I buy PS2 for?

614
00:40:18,173 --> 00:40:20,515
[SPEAKER_20]: I bought Armored Core 2 was my first game, I think.

615
00:40:21,396 --> 00:40:23,257
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted one because it was cool.

616
00:40:23,597 --> 00:40:29,082
[SPEAKER_21]: Because all the cool kids on the block had a PS2.

617
00:40:29,622 --> 00:40:33,546
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I bought a PS1 beforehand when Final Fantasy 7 came out.

618
00:40:33,586 --> 00:40:35,047
[SPEAKER_20]: That was the reason why I bought that one.

619
00:40:35,067 --> 00:40:35,107
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh.

620
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,161
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh So Worth It 2.

621
00:40:37,861 --> 00:40:38,882
[SPEAKER_20]: I haven't heard the buzzer go off.

622
00:40:42,825 --> 00:40:44,426
[SPEAKER_21]: What else is new in Bomani World right now?

623
00:40:44,466 --> 00:40:45,466
[SPEAKER_21]: And there are other stuff going on.

624
00:40:45,506 --> 00:40:48,568
[SPEAKER_21]: There's still 2DX Night Style news that slowly trickles in.

625
00:40:48,588 --> 00:40:52,911
[SPEAKER_21]: It looks like all the songs that are coming back into 2DX are up.

626
00:40:52,971 --> 00:40:55,433
[SPEAKER_21]: I remember you posted something in your live journal about it, right Bradley?

627
00:40:56,194 --> 00:40:56,634
[SPEAKER_21]: Was that you?

628
00:40:58,295 --> 00:40:59,216
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, you want to talk about this?

629
00:40:59,276 --> 00:40:59,396
[SPEAKER_21]: Here.

630
00:41:01,451 --> 00:41:04,752
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I saw a link on DDR Freak and I posted that.

631
00:41:04,792 --> 00:41:29,996
[SPEAKER_18]: Basically, they had a longer list of returning songs, which included some of the new ones are Diving into the Night, Empathy, North also, Lame, Cleone, and there's like one or two others that were new.

632
00:41:30,968 --> 00:41:33,931
[SPEAKER_18]: The biggest update ever is that Tourney Mix 4 has been announced.

633
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:53,813
[SPEAKER_20]: That's, well, I would get on the internet and check what the date was.

634
00:41:53,853 --> 00:41:58,076
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it was on the June 19th or something like that, if my memory serves me right.

635
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:00,097
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's coming up.

636
00:42:00,778 --> 00:42:04,660
[SPEAKER_20]: They pretty much outlawed any DDR songs.

637
00:42:04,921 --> 00:42:10,064
[SPEAKER_20]: It's pretty much only pop and music and Guitar Freaks, I think, or Fair Game, if I remember correctly.

638
00:42:10,785 --> 00:42:13,387
[SPEAKER_20]: And then anything else you want to do.

639
00:42:13,987 --> 00:42:16,569
[SPEAKER_20]: I think they were sick of people doing stupid remixes of...

640
00:42:17,825 --> 00:42:18,805
[SPEAKER_20]: Max 300 and shit.

641
00:42:19,206 --> 00:42:19,866
[SPEAKER_20]: Amen.

642
00:42:20,106 --> 00:42:21,967
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, whoever made that decision.

643
00:42:23,047 --> 00:42:25,888
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, because stupid people out there think that they can remix.

644
00:42:26,068 --> 00:42:28,469
[SPEAKER_21]: Wait a minute though, that means you can't enter Legend of Trance, huh?

645
00:42:28,509 --> 00:42:29,469
[SPEAKER_21]: Because that's decent.

646
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:30,390
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I can't.

647
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:31,010
[SPEAKER_20]: That sucks.

648
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,451
[SPEAKER_20]: But you know what, I'll just make something else.

649
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:34,151
[SPEAKER_20]: Or I'll just get something else to come.

650
00:42:35,552 --> 00:42:37,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me, you've got another mix.

651
00:42:38,053 --> 00:42:39,633
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, but there's no Beatmania either.

652
00:42:39,653 --> 00:42:42,194
[SPEAKER_20]: Damn.

653
00:42:42,214 --> 00:42:42,754
[SPEAKER_20]: Or remixes.

654
00:42:42,774 --> 00:42:43,855
[SPEAKER_20]: What a bunch of bitches.

655
00:42:44,605 --> 00:42:48,426
[SPEAKER_08]: But wasn't it on, um, it wasn't in the TACO movie, was it?

656
00:42:49,106 --> 00:42:49,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn.

657
00:42:50,226 --> 00:42:50,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Make another one.

658
00:42:51,267 --> 00:42:52,307
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll make another one.

659
00:42:52,527 --> 00:42:54,627
[SPEAKER_20]: I've got crap I was working on.

660
00:42:55,568 --> 00:42:59,088
[SPEAKER_20]: I have stuff that I'm working on right now, but it doesn't sound that good, I think.

661
00:43:00,689 --> 00:43:01,069
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

662
00:43:02,089 --> 00:43:05,810
[SPEAKER_20]: See, there was, I can pull it up right now, there was

663
00:43:07,597 --> 00:43:11,160
[SPEAKER_20]: If anyone wants to hear a preview of this one, I guess I can play it.

664
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,521
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, you're going to play us a preview?

665
00:43:12,902 --> 00:43:13,322
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, yeah.

666
00:43:13,682 --> 00:43:14,223
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

667
00:43:14,263 --> 00:43:18,006
[SPEAKER_20]: I might scrap this whole thing because I don't know if I can work with this remix.

668
00:43:18,046 --> 00:43:18,787
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, play the preview.

669
00:43:18,807 --> 00:43:19,307
[SPEAKER_20]: Play the preview.

670
00:43:19,448 --> 00:43:20,408
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, here we go.

671
00:43:20,989 --> 00:43:23,731
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a... I haven't even titled it yet.

672
00:43:23,972 --> 00:43:27,535
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just a remix of The Sound of Goodbye, so here we go.

673
00:43:50,647 --> 00:43:51,310
Thank you for watching!

674
00:44:54,912 --> 00:44:56,554
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's all I have, really, right now.

675
00:44:57,334 --> 00:44:58,075
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what, though?

676
00:44:58,355 --> 00:45:01,819
[SPEAKER_21]: Because you're not going to even be able to use that one either, because that's a 2DX song.

677
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:02,539
[SPEAKER_20]: I know.

678
00:45:04,241 --> 00:45:05,322
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, what else did I have?

679
00:45:05,362 --> 00:45:06,563
[SPEAKER_20]: I had some other shit in here.

680
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:10,106
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyways, so that's going on.

681
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:14,651
[SPEAKER_09]: See, other than that... Remix of Jet World.

682
00:45:16,132 --> 00:45:17,994
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, do a transfer music with a Tar Freak song.

683
00:45:19,244 --> 00:45:42,869
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't because there's not a, the problem is there's a lot of songs, especially the stuff I've been picking now, has either full length version stuff for it, or like, because you need to like be able to like catch the different instruments in there, so because I don't have like an 8 track of it where it has everything separated, you know, so I have to take long, long versions of it so that I can cut different sections out of it and use it.

684
00:45:44,249 --> 00:45:44,970
[SPEAKER_20]: But, I don't know.

685
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:47,792
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm probably gonna, like I said before, I'm gonna probably cut that one.

686
00:45:48,113 --> 00:45:48,853
[SPEAKER_20]: What's this one?

687
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:51,515
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, what is this?

688
00:45:51,636 --> 00:45:52,036
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see.

689
00:45:53,397 --> 00:45:55,178
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, this one I don't think sounded that good.

690
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:56,580
[SPEAKER_20]: I think I scrapped this one.

691
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,402
[SPEAKER_20]: This is like... Yeah, that's awful.

692
00:45:59,462 --> 00:45:59,642
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

693
00:46:02,675 --> 00:46:04,416
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

694
00:46:06,177 --> 00:46:07,438
[SPEAKER_20]: Camelinda Techno.

695
00:46:07,678 --> 00:46:08,759
[SPEAKER_20]: Camelinda Techno?

696
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:09,399
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to hear that.

697
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:10,820
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't even think there's anything.

698
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,421
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I didn't even do anything on this.

699
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:14,142
[SPEAKER_20]: I just, like, it was an idea.

700
00:46:14,162 --> 00:46:15,623
[SPEAKER_20]: I still might do something.

701
00:46:15,643 --> 00:46:16,643
[SPEAKER_20]: You need to finish that one.

702
00:46:16,663 --> 00:46:17,824
[SPEAKER_20]: Camelinda Techno?

703
00:46:17,844 --> 00:46:18,404
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to hear that.

704
00:46:19,245 --> 00:46:21,986
[SPEAKER_20]: There was other news that's sort of Omani-related.

705
00:46:22,086 --> 00:46:22,446
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

706
00:46:22,526 --> 00:46:23,167
[SPEAKER_20]: It came out this week.

707
00:46:23,187 --> 00:46:23,607
[SPEAKER_20]: What's that?

708
00:46:25,488 --> 00:46:26,228
[SPEAKER_20]: Nukutamo.

709
00:46:27,549 --> 00:46:28,230
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, God.

710
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:29,250
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, play one of those.

711
00:46:30,111 --> 00:46:30,531
[SPEAKER_21]: Here we go.

712
00:46:34,822 --> 00:46:39,385
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking of you, I was a fool to let you walk away Yes, in my life today, make my world the color of blue

713
00:47:02,113 --> 00:47:03,113
Thanks for watching!

714
00:47:25,462 --> 00:47:27,183
[SPEAKER_03]: I am Carven, Scarlet with one, only one

715
00:47:59,958 --> 00:48:01,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

716
00:48:21,309 --> 00:48:23,930
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

717
00:48:46,609 --> 00:48:51,913
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so that one was released this week as well as Y31.

718
00:48:52,073 --> 00:48:54,555
[SPEAKER_20]: Unfortunately, I do not have the MP3 for Y31 right now.

719
00:48:54,675 --> 00:48:56,597
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh darn, bummer, what a shame, we can't hear it.

720
00:48:56,617 --> 00:49:06,886
[SPEAKER_20]: But, if you're looking for the link, I don't remember exactly what it was off the top of my head, but I know if you go to our forums, which are on KaliBimani.com,

721
00:49:07,466 --> 00:49:08,287
[SPEAKER_16]: Good plug!

722
00:49:08,627 --> 00:49:22,739
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, you can go there and you'll see a thread that's called, um, Kinda Off Topic But, and that's where I post everything, because, um, our Sack of Mind boards are still down, and, um, so that's where I post all these cool links that I find, and you'll find the link in there.

723
00:49:25,341 --> 00:49:26,602
[SPEAKER_21]: I need to get login info.

724
00:49:28,484 --> 00:49:35,149
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you'll find the links there, and he keeps releasing more, um, I can't remember what else he was working on, but those are two that are definitely good.

725
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:35,830
[SPEAKER_20]: And, um,

726
00:49:36,741 --> 00:49:37,761
[SPEAKER_20]: Colors is awesome, so.

727
00:49:39,642 --> 00:49:47,923
[SPEAKER_20]: Other than that, you know, V-Rare 5 came out, and people, you know, listened to that, and there's some pretty good stuff on it.

728
00:49:48,223 --> 00:49:50,204
[SPEAKER_21]: V-Rare 5 kind of sucked compared to the other ones.

729
00:49:50,224 --> 00:49:51,284
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it was okay.

730
00:49:51,404 --> 00:49:55,465
[SPEAKER_21]: I was all excited because it was all these trance remixes, but I don't know.

731
00:49:55,505 --> 00:49:57,785
[SPEAKER_21]: Kind Lady just wasn't meant to be trance remixed.

732
00:49:58,306 --> 00:49:59,246
[SPEAKER_21]: I like that one.

733
00:49:59,506 --> 00:49:59,766
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't.

734
00:50:00,026 --> 00:50:00,366
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't.

735
00:50:00,806 --> 00:50:02,026
[SPEAKER_21]: But Midnight Blaze was pretty good.

736
00:50:02,246 --> 00:50:04,507
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still waiting for the Safari trance edition.

737
00:50:04,587 --> 00:50:04,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie!

738
00:50:04,847 --> 00:50:04,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie!

739
00:50:07,395 --> 00:50:10,338
[SPEAKER_21]: and Feelings Won't Fade was kind of just Look to the Sky again.

740
00:50:10,358 --> 00:50:12,980
[SPEAKER_20]: Feelings Won't Fade, I Swear to God, is another song.

741
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:16,744
[SPEAKER_20]: I've heard that synth chorus before or whatever.

742
00:50:17,605 --> 00:50:19,807
[SPEAKER_20]: I've heard that melody before and I know it's another song.

743
00:50:19,867 --> 00:50:23,231
[SPEAKER_20]: I know the dumb idiot ripped someone off, but I just have to find the original.

744
00:50:24,892 --> 00:50:26,474
[SPEAKER_20]: Then I Feel was lame.

745
00:50:26,714 --> 00:50:27,675
[SPEAKER_21]: What the hell was that?

746
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:30,258
[SPEAKER_21]: It was like Tori Amos doing I Feel.

747
00:50:35,554 --> 00:50:42,716
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm healing, I'm healing, I'm healing, I'm healing, I'm healing, I'm healing, I'm healing

748
00:51:02,182 --> 00:51:04,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do we crucify ourselves?

749
00:51:38,632 --> 00:51:39,813
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel like any all of a sudden.

750
00:51:41,795 --> 00:51:42,816
[SPEAKER_20]: I played the full song there.

751
00:51:43,076 --> 00:51:55,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Those people out there that are recording are going to make another... I feel... No, it makes me have to go to the bathroom.

752
00:51:55,328 --> 00:51:56,649
[SPEAKER_20]: I have to make a gift.

753
00:52:01,717 --> 00:52:08,400
[SPEAKER_20]: Out of everything that was unlocked in Max 2, I'd have to say the best one had to have been Do It Right, the 80s Electromix.

754
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,621
[SPEAKER_20]: I love 80s music, and that was awesome.

755
00:52:11,181 --> 00:52:13,442
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, Kindly the Interlude was alright too.

756
00:52:13,862 --> 00:52:16,803
[SPEAKER_20]: Look to the Sky Transmix was alright as well, but I don't know.

757
00:52:18,404 --> 00:52:24,046
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just pissed that Do It Right has so many remixes done to it so far, and Dead End has none.

758
00:52:24,486 --> 00:52:26,667
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what's cool about Look to the Sky Transmix?

759
00:52:27,388 --> 00:52:27,888
[SPEAKER_21]: The background.

760
00:52:28,048 --> 00:52:28,388
[SPEAKER_21]: That's it.

761
00:52:29,808 --> 00:52:30,809
[SPEAKER_21]: The background's pretty cool.

762
00:52:31,668 --> 00:52:32,469
[SPEAKER_20]: I like it, okay?

763
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:36,552
[SPEAKER_20]: Because it's actually, it's a different song if you listen to the full version.

764
00:52:37,453 --> 00:52:39,154
[SPEAKER_20]: You can tell it's a different song.

765
00:52:39,654 --> 00:52:41,436
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, the one I was really pissed off on...

766
00:52:43,117 --> 00:52:43,918
[SPEAKER_20]: I actually like Hyper Eurobeat

767
00:53:13,646 --> 00:53:14,367
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you know what?

768
00:53:14,527 --> 00:53:16,889
[SPEAKER_20]: I would play it for you, but I don't have the MP3 because... I have it.

769
00:53:17,129 --> 00:53:17,369
[SPEAKER_20]: I have it.

770
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:18,510
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me bring it up.

771
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:19,351
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

772
00:53:20,192 --> 00:53:20,752
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I'll tell you what.

773
00:53:21,292 --> 00:53:24,615
[SPEAKER_21]: It's kind of long for a break song, but I'll bring it up and we can play a clip from it.

774
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:25,756
[SPEAKER_20]: I can play the 80s electro.

775
00:53:25,856 --> 00:53:27,737
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you want to do it right there?

776
00:53:27,777 --> 00:53:28,138
[SPEAKER_20]: No, let's do it.

777
00:53:28,158 --> 00:53:28,758
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll do that during break.

778
00:53:28,798 --> 00:53:28,998
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

779
00:53:29,018 --> 00:53:29,499
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll do it during break.

780
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:29,739
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

781
00:53:30,259 --> 00:53:35,524
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll play all the DDR edits during the next break, but here, I'll play Glacial because Jamie wants to hear it.

782
00:53:36,164 --> 00:53:38,306
[SPEAKER_21]: So, we'll play a little bit of it, okay?

783
00:53:38,326 --> 00:53:38,406
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

784
00:53:41,949 --> 00:53:43,151
[SPEAKER_21]: No, the oven should be off, Bradley.

785
00:53:43,171 --> 00:53:43,511
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

786
00:53:47,697 --> 00:53:48,699
[SPEAKER_21]: Slap Jamie on the wrist.

787
00:53:51,202 --> 00:53:53,045
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, here's a little bit of Glacier, okay?

788
00:54:21,416 --> 00:54:22,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

789
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:48,453
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a little clip of it.

790
00:54:48,473 --> 00:54:49,653
[SPEAKER_21]: What do you think of that, Jamie?

791
00:54:50,174 --> 00:54:51,395
[SPEAKER_21]: Jamie doesn't have a mic back there, does she?

792
00:54:51,595 --> 00:54:52,095
[SPEAKER_21]: Go give her a mic.

793
00:54:54,136 --> 00:54:54,557
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it.

794
00:54:55,537 --> 00:54:56,378
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not Politary.

795
00:54:56,998 --> 00:55:01,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, actually, when Politary's singing it, though, she's actually in tune.

796
00:55:02,182 --> 00:55:04,163
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the only reason why I actually like Hyper Eurobeat.

797
00:55:04,863 --> 00:55:05,784
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's got fun steps.

798
00:55:06,945 --> 00:55:11,327
[SPEAKER_21]: Easy, but... Alright, um, hey, you wanna watch... It makes me want to burp or something.

799
00:55:11,648 --> 00:55:13,069
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you wanna watch a little bit of that porno now?

800
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:15,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me.

801
00:55:15,794 --> 00:55:16,575
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you want to turn on the porn?

802
00:55:16,775 --> 00:55:17,235
[SPEAKER_21]: Turn on the porn.

803
00:55:18,076 --> 00:55:18,936
[SPEAKER_21]: While I set up for break.

804
00:55:19,196 --> 00:55:19,797
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not moving.

805
00:55:21,278 --> 00:55:22,139
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki, turn on the porn.

806
00:55:22,179 --> 00:55:23,580
[SPEAKER_09]: He's jumping to turn on the porn.

807
00:55:25,241 --> 00:55:26,662
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm setting up for a break here.

808
00:55:29,984 --> 00:55:30,845
[SPEAKER_16]: Play porn.

809
00:55:31,966 --> 00:55:33,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, porn.

810
00:55:34,147 --> 00:55:35,188
[SPEAKER_09]: It's porntastic.

811
00:55:36,029 --> 00:55:36,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Chaperific.

812
00:55:39,991 --> 00:55:40,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Rescue input.

813
00:55:43,414 --> 00:55:44,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Nubian nurse orgy.

814
00:55:48,263 --> 00:55:54,427
[SPEAKER_20]: Starring... Too many people, I can't read it!

815
00:55:55,007 --> 00:55:55,568
[SPEAKER_20]: Brazil?

816
00:55:55,888 --> 00:55:57,389
[SPEAKER_21]: I think I saw Cinnabuns in there.

817
00:55:57,689 --> 00:55:58,410
[SPEAKER_20]: Coco Flame.

818
00:56:01,252 --> 00:56:02,973
[SPEAKER_20]: Kitten Coco.

819
00:56:06,055 --> 00:56:07,195
[SPEAKER_21]: Can we skip to the fucking?

820
00:56:09,477 --> 00:56:10,698
[SPEAKER_20]: Hold on, Pebbles!

821
00:56:17,502 --> 00:56:18,282
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, sorry.

822
00:56:18,302 --> 00:56:20,104
[SPEAKER_20]: I was just thinking of a claw.

823
00:56:29,191 --> 00:56:31,333
[SPEAKER_21]: How exactly are these folks Nubian nurses?

824
00:56:32,234 --> 00:56:34,415
[SPEAKER_20]: Because they're black and they're dressed up like nurses.

825
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,401
[SPEAKER_20]: Do-do-do-do-do.

826
00:56:43,976 --> 00:56:46,657
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, there's really no plot to this at all.

827
00:56:46,977 --> 00:56:51,578
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just like, we're in a hospital and stuff happens and I'm horny now.

828
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:56,799
[SPEAKER_20]: What about all the patients that are dying?

829
00:56:56,859 --> 00:57:00,801
[SPEAKER_21]: That chick that looks like Tyra Banks is having her tits eaten.

830
00:57:08,603 --> 00:57:09,803
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah, she has like a tan line.

831
00:57:17,261 --> 00:57:18,782
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a big mole on her ass, too.

832
00:57:22,284 --> 00:57:26,747
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, yeah, she has an ass, but... Can I skip to another chapter?

833
00:57:27,047 --> 00:57:27,648
[SPEAKER_21]: Go right ahead.

834
00:57:27,888 --> 00:57:30,910
[SPEAKER_21]: We need to get some moaning or something, because this is really horrible radio right here.

835
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:31,710
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see.

836
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:33,551
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see if I can skip a chapter here.

837
00:57:42,597 --> 00:57:43,938
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, damn, she looks pregnant!

838
00:57:50,242 --> 00:57:50,642
[SPEAKER_20]: I love it.

839
00:57:50,682 --> 00:57:53,203
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like elevator porn.

840
00:57:55,084 --> 00:57:56,385
[SPEAKER_20]: Dude, she's not pregnant.

841
00:57:56,425 --> 00:57:57,585
[SPEAKER_20]: She's just fucking fat.

842
00:57:58,365 --> 00:57:59,086
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like tubby.

843
00:58:02,327 --> 00:58:02,947
[SPEAKER_18]: She's got back.

844
00:58:04,428 --> 00:58:05,168
[SPEAKER_20]: She doesn't got back.

845
00:58:05,188 --> 00:58:06,028
[SPEAKER_20]: She's got rolls.

846
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:14,812
[SPEAKER_20]: Dang, that one chick is totally... Dude, I need to find my remote.

847
00:58:15,012 --> 00:58:15,752
[SPEAKER_20]: I feel dirty.

848
00:58:15,772 --> 00:58:16,993
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what we need to find.

849
00:58:17,904 --> 00:58:20,586
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, I think we're going to go to a break now.

850
00:58:23,407 --> 00:58:28,491
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to go to a break, and during this break, you can send us your FUs of the week, because we're going to do those when we get back.

851
00:58:28,551 --> 00:58:29,671
[SPEAKER_21]: So send us your FUs of the week.

852
00:58:29,691 --> 00:58:32,333
[SPEAKER_21]: You can send those over a private message to me in the chat room.

853
00:58:32,373 --> 00:58:33,314
[SPEAKER_21]: My name is Skye.

854
00:58:33,534 --> 00:58:35,195
[SPEAKER_21]: Dude, her nipples are, like, bigger than her hips.

855
00:58:35,695 --> 00:58:38,397
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you're not in the chat room, you can get in there right now.

856
00:58:38,437 --> 00:58:41,078
[SPEAKER_21]: Just go over to www.callybomani.com.

857
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:45,202
[SPEAKER_21]: and then click on Orange Lounge and then click on Chat.

858
00:58:45,403 --> 00:58:46,343
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just that simple.

859
00:58:46,784 --> 00:58:54,292
[SPEAKER_21]: And we'll see you on the other side of this break, which will feature all three of the brand new, new, new songs in Max 2.

860
00:58:54,332 --> 00:58:57,235
[SPEAKER_21]: We have Do It Right, Kind Lady, and Look to the Sky, all remixed.

861
00:58:57,295 --> 00:58:58,116
[SPEAKER_21]: Enjoy, we'll be back.

862
01:00:32,884 --> 01:00:35,086
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

863
01:01:31,147 --> 01:01:34,474
I am the cure, when you wake up late thinking it's a dream

864
01:02:17,279 --> 01:02:17,839
Thanks for watching!

865
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:43,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, ask!

866
01:03:44,344 --> 01:03:46,986
[SPEAKER_18]: This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

867
01:03:51,858 --> 01:03:52,899
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, we are back.

868
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:56,182
[SPEAKER_21]: And what are you guys watching now?

869
01:03:56,642 --> 01:03:58,524
[SPEAKER_21]: You changed the porno and put something else in.

870
01:03:59,505 --> 01:04:03,708
[SPEAKER_21]: That porno is boring, so we're watching Sailor Moon and the Seven Balls.

871
01:04:05,109 --> 01:04:05,710
[SPEAKER_21]: Dear Lord.

872
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:10,133
[SPEAKER_21]: Can we pause it or turn off the video or something for a minute so we can do the FUs of the week?

873
01:04:10,594 --> 01:04:14,337
[SPEAKER_21]: So we can kind of get back to the show that we try to do every Sunday night here.

874
01:04:16,809 --> 01:04:25,672
[SPEAKER_21]: I know you may have forgotten after a week off Oh, big apologies by the way for episode 42 No shit I'm sure Loki enjoyed it

875
01:04:28,891 --> 01:04:36,153
[SPEAKER_21]: Basically what happened with that is, if you're a regular in the chatroom, you did get to see Jamie and myself, and Brad was there too.

876
01:04:36,193 --> 01:04:40,414
[SPEAKER_21]: We did episode 42 on Thursday night, so episode 42, it does exist, it was done.

877
01:04:40,834 --> 01:04:52,978
[SPEAKER_21]: However, I foolishly fucked up the archive file, so Loki tried to do an episode 42 part 2 on Sunday night, except we only had dial-up in the house at the time, and it didn't quite work.

878
01:04:53,958 --> 01:04:57,739
[SPEAKER_21]: What was the highlight of episode 42 for you, Jamie, the one that we did on Thursday night?

879
01:04:58,447 --> 01:04:58,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Going home.

880
01:05:00,910 --> 01:05:03,093
[SPEAKER_21]: And isn't that always the best part of Orange Lounge Radio?

881
01:05:03,374 --> 01:05:04,175
[SPEAKER_21]: Is turning it off.

882
01:05:06,398 --> 01:05:07,239
[SPEAKER_21]: Just kidding, Jesus.

883
01:05:08,341 --> 01:05:08,601
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

884
01:05:08,621 --> 01:05:10,784
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't even have to go home, we're already here.

885
01:05:11,966 --> 01:05:15,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, that's gonna begin my fuck you week, by the way.

886
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:40,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, the first part of the week goes towards driving all the way out here and using up my gas.

887
01:05:41,864 --> 01:05:44,625
[SPEAKER_07]: And you live way the hell out of the way.

888
01:05:46,425 --> 01:05:48,846
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't just turn like this.

889
01:05:49,086 --> 01:05:50,567
[SPEAKER_08]: I could've been near my house.

890
01:05:52,361 --> 01:05:59,266
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, I mean, no offense to Zero, but I'm glad that I didn't have an episode on it.

891
01:05:59,306 --> 01:06:01,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Drive from full speed to South Park.

892
01:06:02,348 --> 01:06:02,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, man.

893
01:06:03,249 --> 01:06:07,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, no, I would have been happy to do it, but I think this isn't what I did.

894
01:06:07,892 --> 01:06:11,774
[SPEAKER_07]: My other 5K of the Week goes towards... Why'd you put my book down there?

895
01:06:12,195 --> 01:06:14,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Or I would never be able to find it.

896
01:06:15,257 --> 01:06:17,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, someone put my book on the floor.

897
01:06:17,258 --> 01:06:18,239
[SPEAKER_07]: 5K's never put my book on the floor.

898
01:06:18,259 --> 01:06:18,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Wasn't me.

899
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:19,760
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't touch your book.

900
01:06:23,378 --> 01:06:23,919
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't do it.

901
01:06:26,601 --> 01:06:28,283
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that mean?

902
01:06:28,303 --> 01:06:31,245
[SPEAKER_20]: Check that book for prints, because I haven't touched it.

903
01:06:32,606 --> 01:06:39,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike Yu goes to A1 Comics Distributor for being sold out of the Battle Royale novel, and I had a gift certificate to get it from him.

904
01:06:40,694 --> 01:06:43,956
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I had to go and actually pay for the book in a bookstore.

905
01:06:45,458 --> 01:06:48,100
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it looks like he goes to these old people who were tailgating me.

906
01:06:49,637 --> 01:06:52,478
[SPEAKER_07]: So I decided to start going five miles an hour.

907
01:06:54,118 --> 01:06:58,919
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I sped up and decided to take another lane.

908
01:07:01,019 --> 01:07:03,800
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't really think of anything else because I'm really happy because I'm working now.

909
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:08,521
[SPEAKER_08]: So I could go through my sleep schedule for not resetting yet.

910
01:07:08,681 --> 01:07:10,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I didn't know this would be a lot.

911
01:07:12,021 --> 01:07:12,822
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's about it.

912
01:07:13,602 --> 01:07:14,222
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you doing?

913
01:07:14,242 --> 01:07:15,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Drugs.

914
01:07:18,717 --> 01:07:20,657
[SPEAKER_07]: So fucking what?

915
01:07:20,777 --> 01:07:22,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Cry me a goddamn river.

916
01:07:23,198 --> 01:07:23,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck y'all.

917
01:07:26,519 --> 01:07:27,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, not you.

918
01:07:27,739 --> 01:07:28,739
[SPEAKER_08]: But fuck everybody else.

919
01:07:29,459 --> 01:07:31,200
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, let me start.

920
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:38,521
[SPEAKER_20]: But... Oh, I'm sorry, were you not done?

921
01:07:38,601 --> 01:07:39,161
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I am.

922
01:07:39,441 --> 01:07:41,722
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry I wasn't meeting you, I meant everyone else.

923
01:07:44,375 --> 01:07:48,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I have a fucking leak, but I think that she's going to address that, so I won't say anything about it.

924
01:07:50,921 --> 01:07:56,026
[SPEAKER_20]: I was going to say, if you can't hear us, there's this little knob on the side of your speakers.

925
01:07:56,046 --> 01:07:57,327
[SPEAKER_20]: It's called volume.

926
01:07:58,128 --> 01:07:58,829
[SPEAKER_20]: Stay with me now.

927
01:07:59,249 --> 01:08:00,010
[SPEAKER_20]: Volume.

928
01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:01,371
[SPEAKER_20]: Turn it up.

929
01:08:02,492 --> 01:08:03,373
[SPEAKER_20]: Turn it talking louder.

930
01:08:04,195 --> 01:08:04,495
[SPEAKER_20]: That's it.

931
01:08:04,755 --> 01:08:09,096
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, now my first review of the week is going to be going to stupid drivers, of course.

932
01:08:09,957 --> 01:08:18,339
[SPEAKER_20]: But this in particular is stupid drivers that don't know how to use the turn lane or the pull out lane or the suicide lane, whatever you want to call it.

933
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:28,142
[SPEAKER_20]: It's that double yellow lane that's inside, you know, many sections of the road, you know, where you can pull in there, stop, and then turn out, you know, or turn out into traffic and that kind of thing.

934
01:08:28,866 --> 01:08:33,089
[SPEAKER_20]: People think that you're supposed to pace cars when you're in that lane.

935
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:36,511
[SPEAKER_20]: No, because you're obviously not going to get out of that lane.

936
01:08:36,591 --> 01:08:39,233
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not going to be able to get in that lane because you're going the same speed as I am.

937
01:08:39,253 --> 01:08:42,776
[SPEAKER_20]: You're supposed to pull out, stop, wait for traffic to clear, then go.

938
01:08:43,496 --> 01:08:44,297
[SPEAKER_20]: It's pretty simple.

939
01:08:44,697 --> 01:08:50,000
[SPEAKER_20]: But no, these dumb fucks out there, they don't understand that you're supposed to stop.

940
01:08:51,862 --> 01:08:52,322
[SPEAKER_20]: Stop?

941
01:08:52,522 --> 01:08:56,445
[SPEAKER_20]: How am I possibly going to get up the speed to make it into traffic?

942
01:08:57,526 --> 01:08:58,026
[SPEAKER_20]: Panic!

943
01:08:58,649 --> 01:09:00,390
[SPEAKER_20]: So, they suck.

944
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:10,012
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, second FB of the week has to go to, um, Net Zero because they suck ass, and I'm glad I won't have to pay for them pretty soon.

945
01:09:10,652 --> 01:09:23,256
[SPEAKER_20]: But, um, yeah, they are now advertising that you can get, like, this stupid, uh, software-accelerated, uh, dial-up or something for five bucks a month more when their service sucks so much anyways, and why'd you have to pay an extra five bucks?

946
01:09:25,137 --> 01:09:26,297
[SPEAKER_20]: I hate them, but, you know what?

947
01:09:27,011 --> 01:09:28,052
[SPEAKER_20]: I've lived off them for a while.

948
01:09:28,753 --> 01:09:30,234
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, let's see what else is here.

949
01:09:30,595 --> 01:09:32,997
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, I have to do unpacking because it sucks.

950
01:09:33,097 --> 01:09:34,779
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't like packing or unpacking.

951
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:36,661
[SPEAKER_20]: The whole moving process sucks.

952
01:09:36,761 --> 01:09:40,825
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wish I could get some paint and sleep in the other house in the morning.

953
01:09:40,865 --> 01:09:41,746
[SPEAKER_20]: Everything's unpacked.

954
01:09:41,786 --> 01:09:43,548
[SPEAKER_20]: But that just doesn't ever happen.

955
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:46,912
[SPEAKER_20]: And, um, let's see, what else?

956
01:09:49,748 --> 01:10:08,319
[SPEAKER_20]: FD to Mashabi Builders of Apartments, because this apartment for some reason has everything cheaply made, like the shower curtain kind of falls off the wall, let's see here, the drawers fall out of the drawers, the gas on the stove sometimes doesn't turn off, which is kind of dangerous.

957
01:10:08,879 --> 01:10:13,022
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, it's stuff like that, you know, you would just normally not think about.

958
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:15,043
[SPEAKER_20]: So yeah, FD to that, and...

959
01:10:17,716 --> 01:10:21,778
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't really have that much more, you know, I was more angsty earlier in the week.

960
01:10:22,178 --> 01:10:25,820
[SPEAKER_20]: Mostly it's stupid people because stupid people cause all the problems in the world.

961
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:29,782
[SPEAKER_20]: Stupid people don't look for where they're driving because they always try to hit me.

962
01:10:29,862 --> 01:10:31,823
[SPEAKER_20]: And just really dumb people out there.

963
01:10:33,483 --> 01:10:33,824
[SPEAKER_20]: That's it.

964
01:10:33,984 --> 01:10:34,624
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, and, um...

965
01:10:36,156 --> 01:10:42,238
[SPEAKER_20]: FU to Jose, our cable installation guy.

966
01:10:43,158 --> 01:10:45,279
[SPEAKER_20]: You're a fucking dumbass sitting here at the time.

967
01:10:45,379 --> 01:10:48,560
[SPEAKER_20]: I wasted a whole fucking day waiting for your ass and you were still two hours late.

968
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:54,821
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me kiss my ass, you bastard, thinking you're going out of all your way just to fucking set up a cable box.

969
01:10:55,101 --> 01:10:57,302
[SPEAKER_20]: Which, by looking at it, I could have probably done myself.

970
01:10:58,102 --> 01:11:01,383
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, and I have to pay you $25 for you to be two hours late.

971
01:11:01,403 --> 01:11:03,924
[SPEAKER_20]: You should fucking have to pay me instead of this piece of shit up here.

972
01:11:04,933 --> 01:11:05,494
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, I'm done

973
01:11:31,656 --> 01:11:41,770
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a few FUs I'd like to give out this week which is interesting because I'm not usually this angsty but I'd like to give a big FU to whoever filed the noise complaint against Loki and I like our third night in the apartment

974
01:11:44,068 --> 01:11:49,492
[SPEAKER_21]: If you think that was loud, you haven't heard anything yet.

975
01:11:49,872 --> 01:11:52,214
[SPEAKER_21]: That really sucked, because we weren't even that loud.

976
01:11:52,234 --> 01:11:57,878
[SPEAKER_21]: We were just playing Max 2, like, kind of loud, and Loki was playing some of his new remixes at a medium volume.

977
01:11:59,139 --> 01:12:00,540
[SPEAKER_21]: And somebody didn't like that, apparently.

978
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:02,201
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, poopy on you.

979
01:12:03,202 --> 01:12:05,964
[SPEAKER_21]: Buy some earmuffs.

980
01:12:06,504 --> 01:12:11,828
[SPEAKER_21]: My next hot cue of the week goes to the big poles that hold up the covered parking lot.

981
01:12:12,975 --> 01:12:17,037
[SPEAKER_21]: because one of them took off my side mirror while I was backing out yesterday.

982
01:12:19,559 --> 01:12:19,879
[SPEAKER_21]: Oops.

983
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:22,620
[SPEAKER_21]: It jumped out of nowhere.

984
01:12:24,722 --> 01:12:33,686
[SPEAKER_21]: And F you to car insurance companies because you charge too much and you rip me off and you charge me deductibles and I hate you.

985
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:34,427
[SPEAKER_21]: That's it.

986
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:37,230
[SPEAKER_21]: I just don't like car insurance, that's it.

987
01:12:38,751 --> 01:12:40,411
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess that's it, I'm all out of angst now.

988
01:12:40,631 --> 01:12:42,032
[SPEAKER_21]: Does Bradley have anything you'd like to share?

989
01:12:42,052 --> 01:12:43,593
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure.

990
01:12:45,094 --> 01:12:45,874
[SPEAKER_18]: Go for it, Bradley.

991
01:12:45,974 --> 01:12:51,657
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck you to general lethargy and laziness on my part.

992
01:12:51,737 --> 01:12:53,618
[SPEAKER_18]: Still haven't found a job yet.

993
01:12:53,958 --> 01:12:54,738
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm lazy as shit.

994
01:12:54,798 --> 01:12:59,060
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck you to body parts that hurt sometimes, like back and feet.

995
01:12:59,241 --> 01:13:02,402
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck you to body parts that hurt sometimes, like back and feet.

996
01:13:04,932 --> 01:13:10,696
[SPEAKER_18]: So, not that you've been alright this week, backstarter, but probably because I sat around in the chair for too long watching stuff.

997
01:13:11,797 --> 01:13:26,767
[SPEAKER_18]: And then, uh, fuck you to peer resets on WinMX, when trying to download something from maybe a Japanese person, it times out or peer resets, and you can't ever find that user ever again, and this is where I probably can't find them, usually.

998
01:13:27,188 --> 01:13:33,252
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck you that, when it was 98, I can't use Japanese, certain Japanese, that's just, I didn't need to upgrade, so, yeah.

999
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:36,500
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, not in 1.98.

1000
01:13:36,701 --> 01:13:38,461
[SPEAKER_18]: With WinMX, though.

1001
01:13:38,501 --> 01:13:42,944
[SPEAKER_18]: Because it's Unicode and you can't do that in 1.98.

1002
01:13:43,444 --> 01:13:44,925
[SPEAKER_18]: But I don't even know if it's in 1.98.

1003
01:13:45,025 --> 01:13:45,885
[SPEAKER_18]: That should happen soon.

1004
01:13:47,766 --> 01:13:50,548
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I'll figure it out someday.

1005
01:13:51,288 --> 01:13:53,369
[SPEAKER_18]: And the fucking people don't share.

1006
01:13:53,389 --> 01:13:53,369
1.98.

1007
01:13:53,409 --> 01:13:53,669
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure, sure.

1008
01:14:00,037 --> 01:14:00,977
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm like one of those people.

1009
01:14:01,257 --> 01:14:04,059
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I'm downloading something and I'm like, oh, you're trying to download it too?

1010
01:14:04,179 --> 01:14:06,199
[SPEAKER_20]: Cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel.

1011
01:14:07,020 --> 01:14:07,740
[SPEAKER_20]: I love doing that.

1012
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:11,842
[SPEAKER_20]: But, um, no, F you to Catherine Zeta-Jones because you fucking suck.

1013
01:14:11,862 --> 01:14:17,464
[SPEAKER_20]: You're a fat pig and you're pregnant and you're smoking and then you're bitching about people taking pictures of you smoking pregnant.

1014
01:14:18,084 --> 01:14:21,985
[SPEAKER_20]: And then you're, like, suing companies because they have nude photos of you standing on your balcony pregnant.

1015
01:14:22,746 --> 01:14:27,127
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, well, first off, don't go out in public pregnant because we don't want to see you naked to begin with.

1016
01:14:27,427 --> 01:14:28,348
[SPEAKER_20]: And number two, you're smoking.

1017
01:14:29,807 --> 01:14:38,110
[SPEAKER_20]: About the file sharing thing, if I don't see people that download for me, I just create a folder with nothing in it for them to download out of.

1018
01:14:38,130 --> 01:14:40,310
[SPEAKER_05]: They can download AIR!

1019
01:14:51,494 --> 01:14:56,900
[SPEAKER_20]: All you need to do is create a giant text file and name it like, you know, Matrix Reloaded dot AVI.

1020
01:15:00,423 --> 01:15:01,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Haha, fooled you.

1021
01:15:03,066 --> 01:15:03,727
You a bitch.

1022
01:15:07,190 --> 01:15:12,534
[SPEAKER_07]: I've decided, though, on Ragnarok Online, though, this is going to be getting such good reviews.

1023
01:15:12,634 --> 01:15:17,638
[SPEAKER_05]: There's people out there going, you know, $10,000 money for cyber theft.

1024
01:15:18,278 --> 01:15:22,862
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to do that, and then after they pay me, my request is going to be, okay, you're fucked, so leave.

1025
01:15:25,662 --> 01:15:27,963
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what I think I want to do with the file sharing thing?

1026
01:15:28,403 --> 01:15:35,707
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to put up files that say Matrix Reloaded, X-Men 2, and all this stuff, and have them be episodes if you can't do that on television.

1027
01:15:36,207 --> 01:15:39,029
[SPEAKER_21]: Because that shows the shit, and everybody should be watching those and not movies.

1028
01:15:40,265 --> 01:15:47,448
[SPEAKER_20]: I was saying earlier that we should have a channel that plays old school Nickelodeon shows, like Salute Your Shorts, Hey Dude.

1029
01:15:47,468 --> 01:15:58,873
[SPEAKER_21]: They have, I think we have it on digital cable too, it's Nick Gas, Nickelodeon Games and Sports, and it shows like Guts, and Wild and Crazy Kids, and all these old school Nickelodeon shows.

1030
01:15:59,633 --> 01:16:01,254
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I think it shows old school Double Dares too.

1031
01:16:01,914 --> 01:16:04,015
[SPEAKER_21]: We have to look on the digital cable line and see if we have it.

1032
01:16:05,215 --> 01:16:06,076
[SPEAKER_21]: That station is cool.

1033
01:16:06,216 --> 01:16:07,696
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's get to the chatroom FUs, shall we?

1034
01:16:08,216 --> 01:16:09,277
[SPEAKER_21]: Because they're getting angsty.

1035
01:16:12,116 --> 01:16:24,443
[SPEAKER_21]: Muheimer would like to say, fuck trying to find a summer job, fuck Microsoft Calendar for not working, and now normally at this time of the year I would say fuck allergies, but the acupuncture therapy I'm doing has relieved all YM pollen allergies.

1036
01:16:24,663 --> 01:16:25,303
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what sucks?

1037
01:16:25,443 --> 01:16:32,347
[SPEAKER_20]: Is I'm allergic to everything, I'm allergic to dust, molds, and pollen, and I'm afraid of needles, so I'm screwed.

1038
01:16:34,008 --> 01:16:36,149
[SPEAKER_21]: And Muheimer says, I suppose that's all then.

1039
01:16:36,470 --> 01:16:38,731
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, but fuck me for being so untanned and white.

1040
01:16:41,863 --> 01:16:43,823
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what, I sympathize with you on that one.

1041
01:16:47,284 --> 01:16:48,705
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, John Fields makes a good point.

1042
01:16:48,745 --> 01:16:51,965
[SPEAKER_21]: If you want to see old episodes of Pete and Pete, you can see those on Noggin.

1043
01:16:52,806 --> 01:16:53,866
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a cool station, too.

1044
01:16:53,926 --> 01:16:55,626
[SPEAKER_21]: Noggin has the old episodes of Square One.

1045
01:16:56,006 --> 01:16:56,686
[SPEAKER_21]: That's awesome.

1046
01:16:57,947 --> 01:17:00,667
[SPEAKER_21]: Square One was the best show ever, like on PBS.

1047
01:17:01,087 --> 01:17:01,868
[SPEAKER_21]: It was MathNet.

1048
01:17:01,888 --> 01:17:02,648
[SPEAKER_21]: You remember MathNet?

1049
01:17:03,708 --> 01:17:06,149
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1050
01:17:06,689 --> 01:17:07,769
[SPEAKER_21]: They showed that in your classroom, Jamie?

1051
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:07,889
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1052
01:17:10,163 --> 01:17:13,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Square One would be piped into the classrooms every day.

1053
01:17:13,105 --> 01:17:14,246
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like a national thing.

1054
01:17:14,546 --> 01:17:21,070
[SPEAKER_07]: You subscribed to the Square One channel, and they would play them during the homeroom of your classroom day.

1055
01:17:21,090 --> 01:17:22,691
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd watch Square One during the homeroom.

1056
01:17:22,711 --> 01:17:24,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I could do it in my homeroom, but it would be on.

1057
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:28,860
[SPEAKER_21]: That's cool.

1058
01:17:29,321 --> 01:17:31,041
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, let's move on with some more FU, shall we?

1059
01:17:31,362 --> 01:17:39,786
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, um... Justin would like to say that this really isn't an FU, but it's funny, okay?

1060
01:17:40,146 --> 01:17:44,008
[SPEAKER_21]: We're getting our roof redone, and I get home and went on my computer with my headphones on.

1061
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:47,390
[SPEAKER_21]: Later, I walk out into the living room, and there's a hole in the ceiling.

1062
01:17:47,810 --> 01:17:49,671
[SPEAKER_21]: One of the guys fell because the board broke.

1063
01:17:50,492 --> 01:17:54,734
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, FU to him, actually, because I had to clean today, and I had to get rid of the insulation out of the boxes today.

1064
01:17:56,233 --> 01:18:04,135
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, and F you to myself and Loki moving because now I don't live five minutes away from Justin B. Sorry.

1065
01:18:11,249 --> 01:18:19,758
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, John Fields would like to say F you to teachers that give you six essays to do over one weekend when it's the end of the semester and it's time to study for finals.

1066
01:18:20,579 --> 01:18:28,527
[SPEAKER_21]: F you to an old guy in a wheelchair who doesn't wait for a walk sign to appear to start crossing backwards so slowly in his wheelchair that I miss my light.

1067
01:18:28,827 --> 01:18:29,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Billy!

1068
01:18:29,548 --> 01:18:30,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Kill me!

1069
01:18:30,609 --> 01:18:31,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Kill me, Billy!

1070
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:32,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Billy!

1071
01:18:35,234 --> 01:18:36,375
[SPEAKER_21]: There is a guy that does that.

1072
01:18:36,415 --> 01:18:38,615
[SPEAKER_21]: He has a cane and he doesn't even give a fuck.

1073
01:18:38,635 --> 01:18:40,216
[SPEAKER_21]: He doesn't even wait for the thing to turn.

1074
01:18:40,376 --> 01:18:44,177
[SPEAKER_21]: Because he knows he's not going to make it in time when the thing turns to walk.

1075
01:18:44,538 --> 01:18:45,258
[SPEAKER_21]: So he just goes.

1076
01:18:45,618 --> 01:18:46,958
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, the hell with traffic.

1077
01:18:47,038 --> 01:18:49,399
[SPEAKER_21]: I hate crotchy people like that.

1078
01:18:49,499 --> 01:18:53,921
[SPEAKER_20]: Grandpa's trying to die and he's like, here's what it's like to be old.

1079
01:18:53,941 --> 01:18:57,142
[SPEAKER_20]: And you're like listening to Sail Away and you lock him in a room.

1080
01:18:57,322 --> 01:18:59,123
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like it's soothing, it's gorgeous.

1081
01:19:03,263 --> 01:19:07,906
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkTetsuya would like to say a big fuck you to the little hacker wannabes that joined in on our Tetranet game.

1082
01:19:08,206 --> 01:19:08,727
[SPEAKER_21]: It's sad.

1083
01:19:09,047 --> 01:19:13,790
[SPEAKER_21]: Too bad you guys probably suck too fucking badly at Tetris that you have to use hacks like that in the first place.

1084
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:14,771
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a goddamn shame.

1085
01:19:15,651 --> 01:19:16,972
[SPEAKER_21]: Tetranet is old school.

1086
01:19:17,032 --> 01:19:18,333
[SPEAKER_21]: I was playing that years ago.

1087
01:19:22,956 --> 01:19:24,618
[SPEAKER_21]: Look, I dropped a piece of the whole row.

1088
01:19:25,458 --> 01:19:27,400
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe they turned it into Prawn Triss or something.

1089
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:27,920
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

1090
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:29,201
[SPEAKER_21]: They were probably using cheats.

1091
01:19:29,622 --> 01:19:30,963
[SPEAKER_21]: No, triangle pieces.

1092
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:37,428
[SPEAKER_21]: An old-ass program like Tetranet is probably really easily hackable, so you can just instantly kill other people.

1093
01:19:37,608 --> 01:19:39,690
[SPEAKER_20]: Why would you even hack Tetris?

1094
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:40,211
[SPEAKER_20]: Come on.

1095
01:19:40,231 --> 01:19:42,092
[SPEAKER_21]: You've got to be fucking bored to be hacking Tetranet.

1096
01:19:42,132 --> 01:19:42,633
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry.

1097
01:19:42,813 --> 01:19:45,215
[SPEAKER_21]: Why don't you, like, hack the government or something useful?

1098
01:19:50,685 --> 01:19:54,267
[SPEAKER_21]: 23rd Magus would like to say a continued FU to Kentucky for obvious reasons.

1099
01:19:54,847 --> 01:19:58,709
[SPEAKER_21]: FU to being super ghetto broke, I can't even buy lunch, cold chicken is what I have to bring.

1100
01:19:59,109 --> 01:20:00,530
[SPEAKER_21]: Glacial Bakwa, anyone?

1101
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:02,131
[SPEAKER_21]: That was a Bomani joke.

1102
01:20:03,812 --> 01:20:05,493
[SPEAKER_21]: FU to hacker wannabes on Tetranet.

1103
01:20:05,553 --> 01:20:07,594
[SPEAKER_21]: Lucky bastards can't even play Tetris.

1104
01:20:07,874 --> 01:20:09,515
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, little bastards can't even play Tetris.

1105
01:20:09,555 --> 01:20:10,255
[SPEAKER_21]: Get a fucking clue.

1106
01:20:17,745 --> 01:20:20,166
[SPEAKER_21]: DDR Angel would like to say that my F.U.

1107
01:20:20,186 --> 01:20:22,366
[SPEAKER_21]: of the week goes to the County Supreme Court.

1108
01:20:23,127 --> 01:20:23,407
[SPEAKER_21]: F.U.

1109
01:20:23,487 --> 01:20:25,107
[SPEAKER_21]: for being called to jury duty.

1110
01:20:27,148 --> 01:20:29,448
[SPEAKER_21]: It's my first one and I don't know what to expect.

1111
01:20:29,488 --> 01:20:34,530
[SPEAKER_21]: Worse yet, I could have been working tomorrow and making more money than a dollar an hour doing jury duty.

1112
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:36,210
[SPEAKER_21]: Remember, no matter what, they're guilty.

1113
01:20:37,331 --> 01:20:38,211
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, and guess what?

1114
01:20:38,791 --> 01:20:40,772
[SPEAKER_21]: DDR Angel has episode 42.

1115
01:20:42,972 --> 01:20:44,653
[SPEAKER_21]: So maybe it won't be so lost after all.

1116
01:20:44,693 --> 01:20:45,733
[SPEAKER_21]: We might be able to get that later.

1117
01:20:52,361 --> 01:20:55,945
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, Snub Dissanoid has a lot of them this week, so brace yourselves, ladies and gentlemen.

1118
01:20:56,986 --> 01:21:00,249
[SPEAKER_21]: First off, to my Algebra 2 teacher, go suck an elephant's shitter.

1119
01:21:00,609 --> 01:21:02,651
[SPEAKER_21]: To teach efficiently, follow these simple steps.

1120
01:21:03,212 --> 01:21:04,713
[SPEAKER_21]: One, pull hairs out of asshole.

1121
01:21:04,974 --> 01:21:06,635
[SPEAKER_21]: Two, teach the fucking course.

1122
01:21:06,775 --> 01:21:10,639
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that because I finished my working class, I reserve the right to read a fucking book.

1123
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:16,005
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't see anywhere in the fucking handbook that states you get to throw out students that are done with work and reading books.

1124
01:21:16,946 --> 01:21:17,767
[SPEAKER_21]: and I'll see you next time.

1125
01:21:47,207 --> 01:22:02,265
[SPEAKER_21]: No, Kung Fu Finally, a big fat fucking shit eat my shit logs fuck you to Comcast for being fucking queefish little shit to change the cable channels I want to watch my fucking TV not wonder what the fucking channels are

1126
01:22:03,354 --> 01:22:04,936
[SPEAKER_21]: Also, Fuck My Dex Drive.

1127
01:22:05,656 --> 01:22:07,518
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck My Dex Drive for not fucking working.

1128
01:22:07,858 --> 01:22:08,959
[SPEAKER_21]: Fucking piece of shit.

1129
01:22:09,299 --> 01:22:12,002
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know it costed money to be pissed off these days.

1130
01:22:12,082 --> 01:22:14,164
[SPEAKER_21]: Or I didn't know it costed money to be pissed off these days.

1131
01:22:14,184 --> 01:22:14,684
[SPEAKER_20]: It could be worse.

1132
01:22:14,724 --> 01:22:16,626
[SPEAKER_20]: You could have an MPX changer.

1133
01:22:17,047 --> 01:22:18,328
[SPEAKER_20]: That thing's a piece of shit.

1134
01:22:19,469 --> 01:22:22,471
[SPEAKER_21]: Another fucking novel courtesy of Snub Destroyed.

1135
01:22:23,172 --> 01:22:26,075
[SPEAKER_20]: I was gonna say, um, here's another FU I had.

1136
01:22:26,455 --> 01:22:27,196
[SPEAKER_20]: Tough.

1137
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:28,257
[SPEAKER_20]: Baiting.

1138
01:22:28,797 --> 01:22:29,598
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, it's gone.

1139
01:22:31,326 --> 01:22:36,114
[SPEAKER_21]: and Maren would like to say a big thank you man to Hulk Hogan.

1140
01:22:36,354 --> 01:22:38,177
[SPEAKER_21]: Hulk, you need to retire, brother.

1141
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:39,479
[SPEAKER_21]: P.S.

1142
01:22:39,559 --> 01:22:40,501
[SPEAKER_21]: Give back my Kurti.

1143
01:22:42,845 --> 01:22:43,586
[SPEAKER_21]: Why is he gone?

1144
01:22:46,625 --> 01:22:59,794
[SPEAKER_07]: The first WWE thing that I see after years, or a year, is, first of all, Rowdy Roddy Piper needs to retire too, or needs to get back in the gym.

1145
01:23:00,655 --> 01:23:01,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, there's more.

1146
01:23:02,516 --> 01:23:15,665
[SPEAKER_07]: But he brings out the newly sight unseen, iron contracted person, Mr. America, who comes out to Real American and does all the poses and it's Hulk Hogan in another persona.

1147
01:23:16,806 --> 01:23:17,807
[SPEAKER_07]: And he can't be fired.

1148
01:23:20,309 --> 01:23:22,410
[SPEAKER_20]: This is going to be retiring because he's fucking old.

1149
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:25,512
[SPEAKER_20]: Dude, they're going to tap him and he's going to break his arm.

1150
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:29,701
[SPEAKER_20]: Am I the only one that doesn't watch wrestling?

1151
01:23:30,502 --> 01:23:31,883
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I saw him retire.

1152
01:23:31,943 --> 01:23:35,325
[SPEAKER_20]: I was flipping through channels and I was thinking, he retired, oh my god, he's gone.

1153
01:23:35,345 --> 01:23:36,506
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm like, finally.

1154
01:23:36,966 --> 01:23:39,127
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, he was cool back in the day, but now he's coming back.

1155
01:23:39,167 --> 01:23:40,809
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like, go away.

1156
01:23:41,369 --> 01:23:42,190
[SPEAKER_20]: Just die.

1157
01:23:42,690 --> 01:23:43,110
[SPEAKER_20]: Die.

1158
01:23:43,210 --> 01:23:49,474
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry, but the coolest wrestler of all time is Andre the Giant, because he was in The Princess Bride, and that makes him cooler than anybody else.

1159
01:23:50,795 --> 01:23:54,578
[SPEAKER_21]: Disagree with me, I dare you.

1160
01:23:56,317 --> 01:23:58,658
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1161
01:23:59,958 --> 01:24:00,959
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's do a quick break.

1162
01:24:01,059 --> 01:24:01,659
[SPEAKER_21]: No, let's not.

1163
01:24:01,699 --> 01:24:02,839
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's just get into the cage match.

1164
01:24:02,859 --> 01:24:03,800
[SPEAKER_21]: You guys want to do a cage match?

1165
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:07,301
[SPEAKER_21]: You want to do a break, come back, talk, and then do cage match now?

1166
01:24:07,321 --> 01:24:08,941
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I need to figure out which song I'm picking.

1167
01:24:09,241 --> 01:24:09,922
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so you want to do a break.

1168
01:24:09,942 --> 01:24:10,542
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll do a break then.

1169
01:24:10,562 --> 01:24:11,502
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll do cage match a little later.

1170
01:24:12,602 --> 01:24:14,503
[SPEAKER_21]: I am going to play a little song.

1171
01:24:16,944 --> 01:24:19,445
[SPEAKER_21]: JB sent me a bunch of MP3s tonight of new Sci-Fam things.

1172
01:24:20,405 --> 01:24:23,068
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, what was that one they wanted to play Max Resurrection?

1173
01:24:23,088 --> 01:24:24,049
[SPEAKER_20]: Dude, that song's old.

1174
01:24:24,229 --> 01:24:25,330
[SPEAKER_20]: They could play it on the show.

1175
01:24:25,530 --> 01:24:31,296
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a decent remix of Max, but... Well, since it's been in demand so much, let's just play it.

1176
01:24:31,536 --> 01:24:33,198
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll satisfy folks and play it.

1177
01:24:33,718 --> 01:24:35,741
[SPEAKER_21]: Like Max Unity, that's pretty good.

1178
01:24:36,201 --> 01:24:36,862
[SPEAKER_21]: Do I have it?

1179
01:24:36,942 --> 01:24:38,523
[SPEAKER_21]: They said they sent it to me, but it's not... I have it.

1180
01:24:38,964 --> 01:24:39,404
[SPEAKER_20]: I have it.

1181
01:24:39,484 --> 01:24:39,905
[SPEAKER_20]: You have it?

1182
01:24:39,985 --> 01:24:40,866
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, you play it.

1183
01:24:41,266 --> 01:24:41,887
[SPEAKER_20]: We can play it.

1184
01:24:42,287 --> 01:24:43,769
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, I'll start off with...

1185
01:24:45,430 --> 01:24:48,652
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see, I said I'd play one of these SyFam ones that JB sent me.

1186
01:24:49,333 --> 01:24:53,216
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't want to play one that's super duper long.

1187
01:24:54,537 --> 01:24:55,397
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry about the noise.

1188
01:24:55,777 --> 01:24:57,158
[SPEAKER_20]: It's me switching through folders.

1189
01:24:57,519 --> 01:24:59,220
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's play... No folders.

1190
01:25:00,181 --> 01:25:00,801
[SPEAKER_20]: Nope, nope.

1191
01:25:03,103 --> 01:25:04,003
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, this one's not too bad.

1192
01:25:04,043 --> 01:25:04,504
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll play this...

1193
01:25:05,290 --> 01:25:06,071
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, that one's kind of long.

1194
01:25:06,131 --> 01:25:09,173
[SPEAKER_21]: All these are really long that you sent me because they're all like extended mixes.

1195
01:25:10,974 --> 01:25:12,155
[SPEAKER_21]: I can play stuff during the break.

1196
01:25:13,636 --> 01:25:14,956
[SPEAKER_21]: I promised I'd play one of these.

1197
01:25:14,996 --> 01:25:15,817
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's just do this.

1198
01:25:16,337 --> 01:25:19,519
[SPEAKER_21]: It's another Judy Crystal song that's not in any DDR that I've seen yet.

1199
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:20,860
[SPEAKER_21]: It's called Boom Boom Boom.

1200
01:25:21,301 --> 01:25:22,041
[SPEAKER_21]: And we'll play that.

1201
01:25:24,243 --> 01:25:24,883
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1202
01:25:24,943 --> 01:25:25,844
[SPEAKER_21]: This isn't SyFam.

1203
01:25:25,864 --> 01:25:27,105
[SPEAKER_21]: This is LED Records.

1204
01:25:27,545 --> 01:25:28,145
[SPEAKER_21]: My bad.

1205
01:25:28,626 --> 01:25:28,986
[SPEAKER_21]: Sheesh.

1206
01:25:30,501 --> 01:25:33,363
[SPEAKER_21]: You're the Sypham's whore, and all of a sudden now you're the LED whore.

1207
01:25:33,403 --> 01:25:34,344
[SPEAKER_21]: How am I supposed to know?

1208
01:25:35,004 --> 01:25:36,225
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't keep tabs on people.

1209
01:25:36,545 --> 01:25:38,407
[SPEAKER_21]: Stop whoring yourself out to every record label.

1210
01:25:39,427 --> 01:25:41,609
[SPEAKER_21]: Then maybe I can keep tabs on these things better.

1211
01:25:45,051 --> 01:25:45,592
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, I'm sorry.

1212
01:25:45,652 --> 01:25:47,073
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, Loki, you want to start with Max Redirection?

1213
01:25:47,093 --> 01:25:49,014
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, I'll play Max Redirection, and then we'll play... ... ... ... ...

1214
01:27:43,211 --> 01:27:55,108

1216
01:29:06,275 --> 01:29:18,435

01:31:00,476 --> 01:31:01,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

01:31:41,814 --> 01:31:48,284
I need to be the evening saint We've got to be my man I wanna shake your hand We've got to fall into the dark

1221
01:33:21,874 --> 01:33:26,639
[SPEAKER_04]: From StepSquad to OrangeLabs, this TDR sucks!

1222
01:33:27,039 --> 01:33:32,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla!

1223
01:33:45,063 --> 01:33:45,543
[SPEAKER_21]: It's Strawberry.

1224
01:33:45,564 --> 01:33:47,105
[SPEAKER_21]: If any of you guys want a popsicle, you can have one.

1225
01:33:47,565 --> 01:33:49,447
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, we have some new guests here in the house.

1226
01:33:49,987 --> 01:33:50,447
[SPEAKER_21]: Say hello.

1227
01:33:50,487 --> 01:33:53,169
[SPEAKER_21]: I know it's warm here because you have to have the windows closed.

1228
01:33:54,010 --> 01:33:55,792
[SPEAKER_19]: It's getting hot in here.

1229
01:33:56,792 --> 01:33:57,413
[SPEAKER_19]: Or in her.

1230
01:33:58,073 --> 01:34:01,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I thought I was supposed to say that.

1231
01:34:01,116 --> 01:34:05,459
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, this is LikeyStyle, fucking it up with Rice Princess over here.

1232
01:34:05,659 --> 01:34:06,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

1233
01:34:07,801 --> 01:34:08,081
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it on?

1234
01:34:08,101 --> 01:34:08,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's on.

1235
01:34:08,662 --> 01:34:09,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, good.

1236
01:34:09,342 --> 01:34:09,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1237
01:34:10,143 --> 01:34:11,664
[SPEAKER_19]: Yo, yo, yo, biznatches.

1238
01:34:13,025 --> 01:34:13,906
[SPEAKER_19]: You've got soul.

1239
01:34:15,310 --> 01:34:17,351
[SPEAKER_21]: Have you done anything interesting in Bomani this week?

1240
01:34:18,751 --> 01:34:21,192
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I downloaded the Sampling Master CDs.

1241
01:34:21,252 --> 01:34:24,933
[SPEAKER_19]: If you guys want to get some pictures of that, please let me know.

1242
01:34:25,713 --> 01:34:26,654
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll take a few pictures.

1243
01:34:26,894 --> 01:34:27,534
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, cool.

1244
01:34:28,014 --> 01:34:30,355
[SPEAKER_19]: And we could even put some of the stuff up on the Orange Lounge.

1245
01:34:30,375 --> 01:34:32,435
[SPEAKER_19]: There's some good stuff in there.

1246
01:34:32,796 --> 01:34:33,456
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll think about it.

1247
01:34:35,637 --> 01:34:36,877
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to kill you.

1248
01:34:39,178 --> 01:34:40,298
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, Irene, you have a request.

1249
01:34:40,998 --> 01:34:43,039
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want you to play the original telephone operator.

1250
01:34:44,576 --> 01:34:46,297
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think I have it.

1251
01:34:46,357 --> 01:34:47,258
[SPEAKER_21]: I can play the edit.

1252
01:34:47,578 --> 01:34:49,859
[SPEAKER_21]: That's about the best I can do for you right now.

1253
01:34:49,919 --> 01:34:50,179
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you?

1254
01:34:50,219 --> 01:34:52,140
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, yes.

1255
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:52,580
[SPEAKER_21]: Later, later.

1256
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:53,120
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll get to it later.

1257
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:53,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1258
01:35:04,285 --> 01:35:06,026
[SPEAKER_21]: We have dead air right now because none of you have a mic.

1259
01:35:09,147 --> 01:35:09,647
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm reading.

1260
01:35:11,148 --> 01:35:14,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone else has been so busy talking about stuff and the ficus were going on long, so I was like, I'll read.

1261
01:35:17,353 --> 01:35:19,234
[SPEAKER_07]: There's 29 more students to go.

1262
01:35:24,198 --> 01:35:24,818
[SPEAKER_19]: What do we have here?

1263
01:35:24,838 --> 01:35:27,160
[SPEAKER_19]: The novel of Battle Royale.

1264
01:35:28,321 --> 01:35:28,761
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh no.

1265
01:35:29,882 --> 01:35:34,866
[SPEAKER_19]: Jamie's Battle Royale infatuation addiction has gone to a new level.

1266
01:35:35,986 --> 01:35:37,087
[SPEAKER_19]: This is pretty interesting, though.

1267
01:35:37,107 --> 01:35:38,008
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like red and black.

1268
01:35:39,315 --> 01:35:41,276
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a very stylish book.

1269
01:35:41,856 --> 01:35:42,757
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like school colors.

1270
01:35:43,097 --> 01:35:43,777
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, there you go.

1271
01:35:44,657 --> 01:35:46,638
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's just the blood on their black outfits.

1272
01:35:49,339 --> 01:35:50,120
[SPEAKER_19]: So, Bradley, what's up?

1273
01:35:50,820 --> 01:35:51,761
[SPEAKER_19]: You've got the other mic.

1274
01:35:51,781 --> 01:35:53,961
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

1275
01:35:54,742 --> 01:35:55,062
[SPEAKER_19]: How much?

1276
01:35:55,482 --> 01:35:56,643
[SPEAKER_19]: I was listening earlier.

1277
01:35:57,183 --> 01:35:59,024
[SPEAKER_19]: I was listening to Orange Lounge before I came here.

1278
01:35:59,144 --> 01:36:00,144
[SPEAKER_19]: I was over at my apartment.

1279
01:36:00,965 --> 01:36:04,846
[SPEAKER_19]: And as soon as you guys said, fuck yous, time for fuck yous of the week, I turned it off.

1280
01:36:05,567 --> 01:36:05,847
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1281
01:36:08,510 --> 01:36:09,190
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, fuck you too.

1282
01:36:10,591 --> 01:36:12,653
[SPEAKER_21]: A late F you to Brad for being a bitch.

1283
01:36:15,414 --> 01:36:17,136
[SPEAKER_21]: The book was, Battle Royale was written in 1999.

1284
01:36:18,556 --> 01:36:18,797
[SPEAKER_21]: Nice.

1285
01:36:19,757 --> 01:36:23,760
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so we're going to be doing the cage match pretty soon here.

1286
01:36:27,462 --> 01:36:28,583
[SPEAKER_21]: What do you want to bake a cake for?

1287
01:36:28,603 --> 01:36:31,925
[SPEAKER_17]: I got one.

1288
01:36:33,214 --> 01:36:34,355
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, boy, this is great.

1289
01:36:35,415 --> 01:36:36,956
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, are we just going to do the cage match then?

1290
01:36:37,496 --> 01:36:38,536
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, we'll go to the cage match.

1291
01:36:39,057 --> 01:36:39,857
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, three songs.

1292
01:36:40,117 --> 01:36:41,538
[SPEAKER_21]: So, your song on the CD, yes, Jamie?

1293
01:36:41,858 --> 01:36:42,038
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1294
01:36:43,378 --> 01:36:44,479
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, we all have new songs.

1295
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:55,764
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, we're going to reset, because just of everything that happened with episode 42, and Loki admitting his song a couple weeks ago was crappy, taking it out.

1296
01:36:56,204 --> 01:36:56,344
[SPEAKER_21]: Huh?

1297
01:36:56,364 --> 01:36:56,424
[SPEAKER_21]: Huh?

1298
01:36:59,281 --> 01:37:00,821
[SPEAKER_08]: My song was cool and now I can't use it again.

1299
01:37:00,841 --> 01:37:01,561
[SPEAKER_21]: You can use it again.

1300
01:37:01,862 --> 01:37:02,122
[SPEAKER_21]: Later.

1301
01:37:02,242 --> 01:37:03,702
[SPEAKER_21]: Because that show is technically lost.

1302
01:37:03,742 --> 01:37:04,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Later, maybe.

1303
01:37:04,422 --> 01:37:04,962
[SPEAKER_21]: What song was that?

1304
01:37:05,662 --> 01:37:06,302
[SPEAKER_08]: None of your business.

1305
01:37:07,203 --> 01:37:07,863
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck you, buddy.

1306
01:37:10,143 --> 01:37:11,204
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll play it another week.

1307
01:37:11,864 --> 01:37:15,764
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, so if you were a fan of that song, it'll come back another week.

1308
01:37:15,944 --> 01:37:16,245
[SPEAKER_19]: No worries.

1309
01:37:16,265 --> 01:37:18,105
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a big surprise for those people who weren't paying attention.

1310
01:37:18,125 --> 01:37:18,665
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so what?

1311
01:37:19,005 --> 01:37:19,505
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah.

1312
01:37:19,545 --> 01:37:21,866
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to start with Loki.

1313
01:37:22,346 --> 01:37:26,527
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki, explain your... Oh, well here, I have to do the whole little music and everything.

1314
01:37:26,567 --> 01:37:27,667
[SPEAKER_21]: We have to make this official...

1315
01:37:28,271 --> 01:37:28,931
[SPEAKER_17]: Off The Shield

1316
01:37:55,869 --> 01:38:03,451
[SPEAKER_21]: And the winning song will go into rotation on Orange Lounge, Bomani Music & More, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station when we're not here.

1317
01:38:03,971 --> 01:38:08,412
[SPEAKER_21]: So, each of the hosts picks a song to go in, and we start tonight with Loki.

1318
01:38:08,532 --> 01:38:09,492
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki, tell us about your song.

1319
01:38:10,192 --> 01:38:20,815
[SPEAKER_20]: My song I heard on a trance compilation CD a while back, and then of course since I've bought turntables, I bought the vinyl for it, so I have the actual clean edit for it.

1320
01:38:21,435 --> 01:38:25,840
[SPEAKER_20]: This one is a song you might remember her from the song Sexual.

1321
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:27,101
[SPEAKER_20]: She sang a while back.

1322
01:38:27,522 --> 01:38:29,203
[SPEAKER_04]: The way I feel is sexual.

1323
01:38:29,223 --> 01:38:30,264
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if you've heard that song.

1324
01:38:30,645 --> 01:38:33,187
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyways, this one's called Yes.

1325
01:38:33,368 --> 01:38:36,150
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the HQ2 Big Room Club edit.

1326
01:38:36,471 --> 01:38:38,473
[SPEAKER_20]: Because the full version is nine minutes long.

1327
01:38:38,493 --> 01:38:40,735
[SPEAKER_20]: This one's pretty long as it is.

1328
01:38:41,276 --> 01:38:43,258
[SPEAKER_17]: So, here we go.

1329
01:40:11,435 --> 01:40:13,656
I pushed up again

1330
01:41:00,894 --> 01:41:02,038
Thank you for watching!

1331
01:44:38,010 --> 01:44:38,810
[SPEAKER_20]: Okie dokie!

1332
01:44:41,351 --> 01:44:46,732
[SPEAKER_21]: Alrighty, that was Amber with Yes, and what was, was that some kind of remix, Loki?

1333
01:44:47,592 --> 01:44:50,233
[SPEAKER_20]: It was the, um, HQ2 Big Room Club mix.

1334
01:44:51,073 --> 01:44:52,574
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, let's see what everyone thought of that.

1335
01:44:52,594 --> 01:44:53,334
[SPEAKER_21]: Bradley?

1336
01:44:54,454 --> 01:44:57,055
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't hear all that much of it, but it sounded okay.

1337
01:44:57,095 --> 01:44:58,095
[SPEAKER_18]: I gave it, like, 7.745.

1338
01:44:59,475 --> 01:45:04,056
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, and, um... What, what happened?

1339
01:45:05,497 --> 01:45:06,037
[SPEAKER_21]: You're leaving?

1340
01:45:08,971 --> 01:45:15,376
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, um, what we're going to do right now is we're going to cut to Jamie's pick real fast.

1341
01:45:19,660 --> 01:45:24,644
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, um, I'm going to cut to Jamie's pick real fast.

1342
01:45:27,026 --> 01:45:32,330
[SPEAKER_21]: And her pick, what we'll do is we'll come back at the end and tell what we thought of all these songs.

1343
01:45:33,291 --> 01:45:37,394
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to do, this is Jamie's pick, it's the Terminator 2 Techno Rave Mix.

1344
01:45:39,591 --> 01:45:40,302
[SPEAKER_21]: and we'll be back.

1345
01:49:15,817 --> 01:49:20,448
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, that was Terminator 2, the Trance remix.

1346
01:49:20,608 --> 01:49:25,379
[SPEAKER_21]: And that was Jamie's pick for tonight's Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

1347
01:49:26,383 --> 01:49:31,484
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, so, we're going to go on to the third song and we'll come around and see what everyone thought of them when we're done.

1348
01:49:31,904 --> 01:49:35,605
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, I always have to pick something crazy, so I certainly did tonight.

1349
01:49:36,185 --> 01:49:41,186
[SPEAKER_21]: This is one of the old school vinyls that came in Loki's pack of 100 vinyls that he ordered.

1350
01:49:43,647 --> 01:49:49,748
[SPEAKER_21]: And this is Raven Simone, who you might remember as the littlest girl on the Cosby show.

1351
01:49:51,841 --> 01:49:55,945
[SPEAKER_21]: She did a song, and this song rules, and it's called That's What Little Girls Are Made Of.

1352
01:49:56,366 --> 01:49:57,607
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're getting old school right here.

1353
01:49:57,687 --> 01:49:59,048
[SPEAKER_21]: This is my cage match pick for tonight.

1354
01:49:59,689 --> 01:50:02,752
[SPEAKER_21]: This is Raven Simone with That's What Little Girls Are Made Of.

1355
01:53:19,653 --> 01:53:20,834
[SPEAKER_21]: I have to take a phone call.

1356
01:53:20,854 --> 01:53:20,974
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

1357
01:53:38,211 --> 01:53:38,791
[SPEAKER_21]: How wonderful.

1358
01:53:40,592 --> 01:53:43,292
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki, go around and give people's thoughts on all three of those songs, would you?

1359
01:53:43,913 --> 01:53:44,533
[SPEAKER_20]: Okie dokie.

1360
01:53:44,553 --> 01:53:46,513
[SPEAKER_20]: Ooh, I got the mic set to long.

1361
01:53:46,713 --> 01:53:49,214
[SPEAKER_20]: Dude, this mic right here, you can broadcast anywhere in the house.

1362
01:53:49,234 --> 01:53:50,895
[SPEAKER_20]: What'd you think of the songs?

1363
01:53:50,915 --> 01:53:53,215
[SPEAKER_20]: First one was mine.

1364
01:53:55,856 --> 01:53:56,316
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, here.

1365
01:53:59,017 --> 01:53:59,897
[SPEAKER_18]: They all seemed pretty good.

1366
01:54:00,617 --> 01:54:02,318
[SPEAKER_18]: I just didn't hear them all that well.

1367
01:54:02,738 --> 01:54:06,739
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember when the Raven-Symoné one came out, they showed it at the end of Kazuko, I think.

1368
01:54:07,839 --> 01:54:10,103
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, he's playing tug-of-war with a cow.

1369
01:54:10,303 --> 01:54:11,645
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, check this out.

1370
01:54:12,045 --> 01:54:15,130
[SPEAKER_18]: Check this out, man.

1371
01:54:15,170 --> 01:54:16,772
[SPEAKER_20]: He's playing tug-of-war with a cow.

1372
01:54:18,054 --> 01:54:19,356
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like the greatest show ever.

1373
01:54:24,815 --> 01:54:29,378
[SPEAKER_20]: If you've got TNN at home right now, turn it to Most Extreme Elimination Challenge.

1374
01:54:29,559 --> 01:54:32,060
[SPEAKER_20]: I tell ya, man, it's the most kick-ass show ever.

1375
01:54:32,401 --> 01:54:34,602
[SPEAKER_20]: They are playing tug-of-war right now with a bunch of different things.

1376
01:54:34,782 --> 01:54:35,223
[SPEAKER_20]: Watch this guy.

1377
01:54:35,243 --> 01:54:36,584
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey, wait, you're not talking about Cage Match.

1378
01:54:36,784 --> 01:54:38,285
[SPEAKER_20]: He's gonna get screwed right now.

1379
01:54:38,385 --> 01:54:39,646
[SPEAKER_20]: Watch this, this is so wrong.

1380
01:54:40,527 --> 01:54:46,571
[SPEAKER_20]: Because the other guy had a... So they don't tell them what they're gonna pull against?

1381
01:54:46,991 --> 01:54:51,595
[SPEAKER_20]: They run down the line of ropes there, and they have to pick a random rope, and each rope's attached to something different.

1382
01:54:53,805 --> 01:54:59,637
[SPEAKER_20]: And this one, the last one, the little girl, the girl gets to tug a war against some idol.

1383
01:55:00,639 --> 01:55:02,503
[SPEAKER_21]: So, what did we think of those three songs?

1384
01:55:03,994 --> 01:55:23,403
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes was cool, um, because I picked it, nah, it was alright, I don't know, it sounded better on the CD, because it probably was shorter on the CD, um, the Terminator 2 one sucked, I, no, at first I thought it was going to be, uh, there's another song called Turn Up the Blaster or something like that, some Scooter song sounds like the Terminator 2 thing, I thought that was what it was going to be at first.

1385
01:55:23,843 --> 01:55:27,024
[SPEAKER_20]: That was a good cigarette out there Sorry, I wasn't in here to hear it, so ask somebody else

1386
01:55:52,637 --> 01:55:56,561
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one was okay, I couldn't really hear it, but it was okay.

1387
01:55:57,081 --> 01:56:02,486
[SPEAKER_07]: The second one, I don't know how, I guess I didn't hear how it sounded anything like Terminator, but whatever.

1388
01:56:03,307 --> 01:56:04,008
[SPEAKER_07]: It was okay, too.

1389
01:56:04,848 --> 01:56:09,393
[SPEAKER_07]: The third one was, like, really silly that you picked it, Rob.

1390
01:56:09,733 --> 01:56:09,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1391
01:56:10,554 --> 01:56:10,934
[SPEAKER_21]: Of course.

1392
01:56:11,835 --> 01:56:12,495
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was okay.

1393
01:56:12,916 --> 01:56:13,737
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll say what I thought.

1394
01:56:13,777 --> 01:56:15,718
[SPEAKER_21]: The Amber song, I've heard better from Amber.

1395
01:56:15,738 --> 01:56:17,080
[SPEAKER_21]: That one was a little too weird.

1396
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:18,321
[SPEAKER_21]: It was too diva-ish for me.

1397
01:56:20,089 --> 01:56:21,290
[SPEAKER_20]: I've got some more, too.

1398
01:56:21,851 --> 01:56:25,814
[SPEAKER_20]: See, that wasn't the one I wanted to pick this week.

1399
01:56:25,874 --> 01:56:33,520
[SPEAKER_20]: It was actually the one I wanted to pick was... I don't remember the title, but I have another one called The Need to Be Naked.

1400
01:56:34,821 --> 01:56:36,122
[SPEAKER_21]: Ah, I think I've heard that song before.

1401
01:56:39,485 --> 01:56:41,006
[SPEAKER_21]: And the second song was okay.

1402
01:56:41,266 --> 01:56:42,247
[SPEAKER_21]: It was all right.

1403
01:56:45,181 --> 01:57:14,202
[SPEAKER_21]: and then the third song was awesome of course because it was old school so you can send in those votes now to me, I'm Sky, I'm in the chat room and once we have a winner we'll let you know and that song will go into rotation on Orange Lounge Radio we're going to go to break because there's a lot of chaos going around in the studio right now so we need to take a quick break and hope you bear with us and we will be back very soon

1404
01:57:19,372 --> 01:57:32,275
[SPEAKER_11]: Do it all night, do it with me, I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free, babe Do it tonight, do it alright, just take me and shake me till I burn up inside, oh

1405
01:57:54,853 --> 01:57:58,902
With handsome friends and chicken can But you're gonna feel so free when you do

1406
02:00:26,618 --> 02:00:27,785
Thanks for watching!

1407
02:02:37,216 --> 02:02:40,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.

1408
02:02:41,179 --> 02:02:42,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1409
02:02:44,441 --> 02:02:46,383
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello, we are back.

1410
02:02:47,244 --> 02:02:49,585
[SPEAKER_21]: And sorry about that, we had to give you a lot of music there.

1411
02:02:49,705 --> 02:02:52,467
[SPEAKER_21]: Just a lot of stuff going on in the studio right now.

1412
02:02:52,487 --> 02:02:55,750
[SPEAKER_21]: Some folks are watching the, what, Extreme Challenge thing going on?

1413
02:02:57,729 --> 02:02:59,551
[SPEAKER_20]: Most extreme elimination challenge.

1414
02:02:59,571 --> 02:03:00,772
[SPEAKER_20]: The most extreme.

1415
02:03:01,632 --> 02:03:02,393
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, best show ever.

1416
02:03:03,174 --> 02:03:05,996
[SPEAKER_21]: And unfortunately, Jamie got a phone call and had to leave.

1417
02:03:06,356 --> 02:03:07,437
[SPEAKER_21]: And we don't know much about that.

1418
02:03:08,218 --> 02:03:09,178
[SPEAKER_20]: Last minute FU of the week.

1419
02:03:09,258 --> 02:03:10,720
[SPEAKER_20]: I remember this because this was last night.

1420
02:03:11,060 --> 02:03:13,021
[SPEAKER_20]: Last night I watched The Price is Right.

1421
02:03:13,201 --> 02:03:17,925
[SPEAKER_20]: They had this million dollar special where they were giving out prizes that were just like thousands and thousands of dollars.

1422
02:03:18,886 --> 02:03:21,228
[SPEAKER_20]: One of the prizes that they had...

1423
02:03:22,307 --> 02:03:22,447
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

1424
02:03:22,787 --> 02:03:23,728
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, it's close.

1425
02:03:23,868 --> 02:03:24,408
[SPEAKER_20]: It's Pump It Up.

1426
02:03:25,048 --> 02:03:25,348
[SPEAKER_19]: Whoa!

1427
02:03:25,368 --> 02:03:25,568
[SPEAKER_19]: Holy crap!

1428
02:03:25,588 --> 02:03:30,830
[SPEAKER_20]: They had a Pump It Up machine that they were giving away as a prize, and the lady didn't win it because she's a dumbass.

1429
02:03:30,850 --> 02:03:33,131
[SPEAKER_20]: I was like, fuckers!

1430
02:03:33,911 --> 02:03:36,232
[SPEAKER_19]: I would, yeah, she wouldn't appreciate it.

1431
02:03:37,513 --> 02:03:44,675
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, but seriously, the prizes, okay, the prizes you normally, like a normal showcase would be like $20,000, $30,000 maybe, like every now and then.

1432
02:03:45,136 --> 02:03:47,196
[SPEAKER_20]: This was like, the one showcase was $101,000.

1433
02:03:49,315 --> 02:03:52,641
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow, I would have been on there and fucking ruled.

1434
02:03:52,681 --> 02:04:00,696
[SPEAKER_20]: The guy won a trip to England, he won a new car and a boat, and then there was some other thing that he won that was like...

1435
02:04:01,107 --> 02:04:02,588
[SPEAKER_19]: They should have had a 2DX machine on there.

1436
02:04:02,628 --> 02:04:03,328
[SPEAKER_19]: I would have wanted it.

1437
02:04:03,388 --> 02:04:08,850
[SPEAKER_20]: No, but they had a pump-it-up machine, they had some NHL game, and then they had something else.

1438
02:04:08,990 --> 02:04:09,690
[SPEAKER_20]: I forget what else.

1439
02:04:09,770 --> 02:04:14,552
[SPEAKER_19]: I would have gone on Pressure 8 if I knew, because they don't usually give away video games and stuff.

1440
02:04:14,572 --> 02:04:15,532
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, this is a special.

1441
02:04:15,752 --> 02:04:16,492
[SPEAKER_19]: A tea set!

1442
02:04:16,592 --> 02:04:20,074
[SPEAKER_20]: And you know how normally if they win... A fondue plate dish or something.

1443
02:04:20,134 --> 02:04:21,954
[SPEAKER_20]: Was it that stupid wheel that they spin?

1444
02:04:22,094 --> 02:04:25,376
[SPEAKER_20]: How you land on $10,000 and you normally get $10,000?

1445
02:04:25,416 --> 02:04:25,916
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1446
02:04:26,376 --> 02:04:28,257
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, because this was the special million dollar show.

1447
02:04:28,277 --> 02:04:28,657
[SPEAKER_19]: It was $10,000 and $100,000?

1448
02:04:29,628 --> 02:04:31,129
[SPEAKER_20]: No, it was 1,000 and a million.

1449
02:04:32,029 --> 02:04:32,449
[SPEAKER_19]: What?

1450
02:04:33,290 --> 02:04:33,730
[SPEAKER_19]: What?

1451
02:04:34,730 --> 02:04:37,891
[SPEAKER_19]: But your odds of getting that are pretty... Unless you cheat.

1452
02:04:39,972 --> 02:04:40,633
[SPEAKER_21]: That's cool.

1453
02:04:40,853 --> 02:04:42,994
[SPEAKER_21]: I remember the time I went to see The Price is Right.

1454
02:04:43,014 --> 02:04:43,834
[SPEAKER_21]: It was so wonderful.

1455
02:04:43,974 --> 02:04:44,414
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to go.

1456
02:04:44,434 --> 02:04:45,835
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to go back so bad.

1457
02:04:45,915 --> 02:04:52,678
[SPEAKER_21]: I know I get... I do get nostalgic when I think about The Price is Right, because it was so wonderful, and I had a great time.

1458
02:04:53,178 --> 02:04:55,079
[SPEAKER_19]: Bob... Bob... Oh, man.

1459
02:04:55,119 --> 02:04:58,380
[SPEAKER_19]: Bob Barker and his fake and bake is a rice princess that we're...

1460
02:04:58,840 --> 02:05:15,807
[SPEAKER_19]: He's got like the fakest tan, he's always like It's not really that he has a fake tan, his makeup is orange, he looks orange in person Yeah, on the TV he doesn't look so orange, but what I've heard is when you go there to the studio, he's like, he's a fucking tangerine, dude You ever wonder what happened to the Oompa Loompas when they grew up?

1461
02:05:17,088 --> 02:05:26,692
[SPEAKER_19]: Bob Barker Seriously No, dude, Bob Barker's my hero, he's like 90 years old or something and he's got Poon Annie running around his studio like nothing and they want him

1462
02:05:28,325 --> 02:05:35,024
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, if you had to put Bob Barker versus Hugh Hefner in a fight, didn't you see Happy Gilmore?

1463
02:05:36,067 --> 02:05:37,687
[SPEAKER_19]: The Price is Wrong, bitch.

1464
02:05:38,728 --> 02:05:39,808
[SPEAKER_19]: Wait, that was Adam Sandler's line.

1465
02:05:40,028 --> 02:05:42,669
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, still, Bob Barker kicks some ass in that fight.

1466
02:05:43,309 --> 02:05:44,529
[SPEAKER_19]: Best fight scene ever in Hollywood.

1467
02:05:44,689 --> 02:05:45,390
[SPEAKER_19]: What do you think, Rob?

1468
02:05:45,490 --> 02:05:57,633
[SPEAKER_21]: I remember that when we went and saw The Price is Right being filmed live, they can do little question and answers sections between, like, when there's commercial breaks usually, Bob Barker's doing, like, this little question and answer thing.

1469
02:05:57,653 --> 02:05:59,974
[SPEAKER_21]: And somebody asked about, like, will there ever be a Happy Gilmore 2?

1470
02:06:00,014 --> 02:06:00,094
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

1471
02:06:02,048 --> 02:06:03,409
[SPEAKER_19]: He's not the one producing the movie.

1472
02:06:03,449 --> 02:06:04,050
[SPEAKER_19]: How would he know?

1473
02:06:04,690 --> 02:06:05,030
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

1474
02:06:05,231 --> 02:06:06,111
[SPEAKER_21]: Or has he been asked?

1475
02:06:06,231 --> 02:06:07,452
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't remember what the exact question was.

1476
02:06:07,472 --> 02:06:08,073
[SPEAKER_19]: That's funny, though.

1477
02:06:08,453 --> 02:06:12,156
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, let's reveal tonight's winner of the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

1478
02:06:12,296 --> 02:06:13,477
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's quite a shocker.

1479
02:06:15,699 --> 02:06:21,964
[SPEAKER_21]: By only one vote... By only one vote, the winning song was...

1480
02:06:29,403 --> 02:06:33,827
[SPEAKER_21]: That's right, it was Raven-Symoné with That's What Little Girls Are Made Of was tonight's cage match winner.

1481
02:06:33,847 --> 02:06:35,228
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the track.

1482
02:06:35,989 --> 02:06:36,829
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the joint.

1483
02:06:37,530 --> 02:06:38,211
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the cut.

1484
02:06:38,691 --> 02:06:39,872
[SPEAKER_19]: And all those ghetto slang.

1485
02:06:40,733 --> 02:06:42,254
[SPEAKER_19]: And it won by a whopping one vote.

1486
02:06:43,415 --> 02:06:44,356
[SPEAKER_21]: How many people voted?

1487
02:06:44,576 --> 02:06:45,317
[SPEAKER_21]: Or can you say on there?

1488
02:06:45,337 --> 02:06:45,637
[SPEAKER_19]: A handful.

1489
02:06:45,917 --> 02:06:46,378
[SPEAKER_19]: A handful.

1490
02:06:46,518 --> 02:06:47,358
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1491
02:06:47,439 --> 02:06:51,302
[SPEAKER_21]: Not as many as usual, but not the least I've ever seen vote in a cage match.

1492
02:06:51,942 --> 02:06:54,505
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think there were a lot of people like, I ain't voting for any of that shit.

1493
02:06:56,506 --> 02:06:57,947
[SPEAKER_21]: For any of it, yeah.

1494
02:06:57,967 --> 02:07:01,770
[SPEAKER_19]: Basically like the real presidential polls nowadays, you know?

1495
02:07:02,030 --> 02:07:05,893
[SPEAKER_21]: I actually had to think about it for a minute because people were voting yes.

1496
02:07:06,093 --> 02:07:07,555
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm like, what do you mean you vote yes?

1497
02:07:08,275 --> 02:07:09,736
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, yeah, we had a song called Yes.

1498
02:07:09,976 --> 02:07:14,620
[SPEAKER_21]: You don't vote yes or no on a... You don't vote yes or no on the cage match, you stupid punks.

1499
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:16,201
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm still playing at baseball.

1500
02:07:16,221 --> 02:07:16,762
[SPEAKER_17]: We did have a yes.

1501
02:07:17,562 --> 02:07:18,423
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, okay, sorry.

1502
02:07:18,843 --> 02:07:24,525
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so as I mentioned a second ago, you might have missed it because we were talking about Cage Match, Jamie left.

1503
02:07:25,346 --> 02:07:31,548
[SPEAKER_21]: She had another situation she had to take care of, so she's left the building, but we've got plenty of guests still here.

1504
02:07:31,628 --> 02:07:32,509
[SPEAKER_21]: We have Brad and Irene.

1505
02:07:32,949 --> 02:07:37,171
[SPEAKER_21]: The Ice Queen walked in at some point during the Cage Match in the corner.

1506
02:07:38,631 --> 02:07:44,714
[SPEAKER_21]: Anita and Dark Child are on their way, and they keep calling me from different places going, I can't find it.

1507
02:07:44,734 --> 02:07:47,095
[SPEAKER_21]: We're in Mexico, and we can't find your place.

1508
02:07:48,186 --> 02:07:50,848
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, it's hard to drive when you're getting pleasured in the car.

1509
02:07:51,829 --> 02:07:54,311
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, wow.

1510
02:07:55,412 --> 02:08:00,817
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, so, but we thought we'd use this opportunity since we're really low on ideas and material.

1511
02:08:01,758 --> 02:08:05,881
[SPEAKER_21]: Irene had something she wanted to do for a while now.

1512
02:08:07,242 --> 02:08:10,745
[SPEAKER_21]: But you're going to have to explain this because even I don't know how this works.

1513
02:08:10,845 --> 02:08:13,928
[SPEAKER_21]: But, oh wait, we have to have theme music.

1514
02:08:14,328 --> 02:08:14,568
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1515
02:08:14,889 --> 02:08:16,250
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, we have to have theme music for this.

1516
02:08:16,270 --> 02:08:16,490
[SPEAKER_21]: That's fine.

1517
02:08:18,956 --> 02:08:21,237
[SPEAKER_21]: Give me a minute here because we have to have theme music for this.

1518
02:08:21,977 --> 02:08:23,518
[SPEAKER_21]: It's going to be a segment.

1519
02:08:24,098 --> 02:08:25,539
[SPEAKER_21]: Irene, what is this segment called?

1520
02:08:25,959 --> 02:08:30,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I introduced it a couple weeks ago into the chat room, an idea.

1521
02:08:30,141 --> 02:08:31,501
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Orange Crush.

1522
02:08:32,001 --> 02:08:32,502
[SPEAKER_21]: That's right.

1523
02:08:32,562 --> 02:08:34,903
[SPEAKER_21]: It's time for Orange Crush.

1524
02:08:36,243 --> 02:08:37,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I hope not.

1525
02:08:38,824 --> 02:08:39,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Crush.

1526
02:08:40,385 --> 02:08:41,865
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Crush.

1527
02:08:42,025 --> 02:08:43,006
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Crush.

1528
02:08:43,066 --> 02:08:44,727
[SPEAKER_21]: It's time for Orange Crush.

1529
02:08:44,907 --> 02:08:46,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Go kick your ass.

1530
02:08:46,427 --> 02:08:46,767
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1531
02:08:47,068 --> 02:08:48,088
[SPEAKER_21]: How does Orange Crush work?

1532
02:08:48,484 --> 02:08:52,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, it was kind of a, I don't know, basic idea.

1533
02:08:52,385 --> 02:08:59,907
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't, nothing's finalized, but we could basically take two people from the studio and we're going to ask them questions, the same set of questions.

1534
02:09:00,027 --> 02:09:06,108
[SPEAKER_07]: One person, I guess, can just leave while we ask one person and then they can come back and then the other person can leave and blah, blah, blah, blah.

1535
02:09:06,508 --> 02:09:07,909
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, and it's timed.

1536
02:09:07,949 --> 02:09:09,929
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you have 30 seconds to answer five questions.

1537
02:09:10,329 --> 02:09:10,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

1538
02:09:10,509 --> 02:09:12,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Which really shouldn't take too long or anything.

1539
02:09:12,750 --> 02:09:13,670
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's a trivia game.

1540
02:09:14,170 --> 02:09:14,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, pretty much.

1541
02:09:15,010 --> 02:09:15,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

1542
02:09:15,230 --> 02:09:16,711
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a theme to each one.

1543
02:09:16,811 --> 02:09:17,191
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, okay.

1544
02:09:17,211 --> 02:09:17,291
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1545
02:09:17,991 --> 02:09:20,752
[SPEAKER_07]: So, someone's knocking on the door and that's really scary.

1546
02:09:21,852 --> 02:09:22,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Did someone drop a spoon?

1547
02:09:23,052 --> 02:09:24,533
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe we have somebody else who wants to compete.

1548
02:09:25,693 --> 02:09:26,453
[SPEAKER_21]: Come in, come in, come in.

1549
02:09:26,713 --> 02:09:27,113
[SPEAKER_21]: Get him in here.

1550
02:09:27,674 --> 02:09:28,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Who is it?

1551
02:09:28,994 --> 02:09:29,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Shite.

1552
02:09:30,734 --> 02:09:31,935
[SPEAKER_07]: He has your shirt on!

1553
02:09:32,595 --> 02:09:33,295
[SPEAKER_21]: Come in, come in, come in.

1554
02:09:33,315 --> 02:09:34,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Brad, he has your shirt on.

1555
02:09:35,455 --> 02:09:36,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at his shirt.

1556
02:09:36,056 --> 02:09:37,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Brad has that shirt.

1557
02:09:38,436 --> 02:09:38,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that funny?

1558
02:09:39,477 --> 02:09:42,317
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, welcome to Dark Child and Anita who finally found the place.

1559
02:09:43,017 --> 02:09:43,518
[SPEAKER_21]: How you doing?

1560
02:09:43,558 --> 02:09:45,178
[SPEAKER_21]: How big is the clock tower supposed to be?

1561
02:09:45,198 --> 02:09:45,398
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm okay.

1562
02:09:46,838 --> 02:09:48,019
[SPEAKER_15]: Clock Tower Storage.

1563
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:52,702
[SPEAKER_15]: I need a rope clock tower, so I'm looking for a clock tower.

1564
02:09:52,742 --> 02:09:55,263
[SPEAKER_07]: We're about to do a segment called Orange Crush.

1565
02:09:55,303 --> 02:09:56,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, we need two volunteers.

1566
02:10:00,647 --> 02:10:04,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah.

1567
02:10:07,111 --> 02:10:10,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so who's going to compete in Orange Crush?

1568
02:10:10,293 --> 02:10:13,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I need two volunteers from the studio who wants to do Orange Crush.

1569
02:10:14,497 --> 02:10:15,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Just raise your hand.

1570
02:10:15,658 --> 02:10:16,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Bradley will be one.

1571
02:10:18,682 --> 02:10:21,746
[SPEAKER_07]: And, oh, you or Matt, whoever.

1572
02:10:24,609 --> 02:10:27,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, it'll be Dark Child, I guess.

1573
02:10:28,502 --> 02:10:28,822
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1574
02:10:29,083 --> 02:10:31,144
[SPEAKER_21]: So, Dark Child and Bradley.

1575
02:10:31,244 --> 02:10:33,807
[SPEAKER_21]: So, since Dark Child just got here, he can go first.

1576
02:10:33,947 --> 02:10:38,731
[SPEAKER_21]: And, Brad, why don't you take Bradley outside and into the soundproof booth.

1577
02:10:39,011 --> 02:10:39,952
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, we need a timer.

1578
02:10:40,052 --> 02:10:40,752
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't have a timer.

1579
02:10:41,873 --> 02:10:43,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Can someone count to 30?

1580
02:10:43,795 --> 02:10:44,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody?

1581
02:10:44,496 --> 02:10:45,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody in the audience?

1582
02:10:45,837 --> 02:10:46,617
[SPEAKER_21]: What did I volunteer for?

1583
02:10:46,637 --> 02:10:48,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Does somebody have a watch with a stopwatch?

1584
02:10:49,059 --> 02:10:52,883
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little segment that we... Oh, I can play 30 seconds of a song.

1585
02:10:52,923 --> 02:10:53,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1586
02:10:53,143 --> 02:10:53,603
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll do that.

1587
02:10:53,763 --> 02:10:54,024
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1588
02:10:54,264 --> 02:10:55,685
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you explain Orange Crush to me?

1589
02:10:55,785 --> 02:10:56,746
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I'm a noob still.

1590
02:10:57,697 --> 02:10:59,357
[SPEAKER_07]: One more time for those who weren't paying attention.

1591
02:10:59,397 --> 02:11:03,298
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically a trivia game where we have 30 seconds.

1592
02:11:03,338 --> 02:11:05,318
[SPEAKER_07]: We ask you five questions, however many you get right.

1593
02:11:05,338 --> 02:11:08,399
[SPEAKER_07]: You're competing against Bradley to answer more questions.

1594
02:11:09,239 --> 02:11:10,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, he needs a microphone.

1595
02:11:10,919 --> 02:11:11,600
[SPEAKER_07]: He needs a microphone.

1596
02:11:11,620 --> 02:11:11,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on.

1597
02:11:12,360 --> 02:11:13,300
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's get him wired up here.

1598
02:11:14,900 --> 02:11:16,040
[SPEAKER_15]: You have more than two microphones now?

1599
02:11:16,060 --> 02:11:16,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty much, yeah.

1600
02:11:16,821 --> 02:11:18,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the end of when Ben signs money.

1601
02:11:19,041 --> 02:11:21,841
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, Loki, I must say, nice collection of DVDs over here.

1602
02:11:23,762 --> 02:11:24,442
[SPEAKER_20]: I have more on tape.

1603
02:11:27,076 --> 02:11:30,879
[SPEAKER_15]: Porno, porno, porno, anime, porn, porn, porn, porn, porn, anime.

1604
02:11:31,579 --> 02:11:34,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so you can... Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1605
02:11:37,464 --> 02:11:41,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, the theme of this one is called Love Me Do.

1606
02:11:43,188 --> 02:11:43,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Here and now?

1607
02:11:44,028 --> 02:11:44,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1608
02:11:44,589 --> 02:11:48,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so can we... Oh, he has to cue up the music.

1609
02:11:48,131 --> 02:11:52,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so basically what you're expecting is questions about Akira Yamaoka.

1610
02:11:54,116 --> 02:11:54,737
[SPEAKER_15]: I've fucked.

1611
02:11:55,037 --> 02:11:55,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.

1612
02:11:55,837 --> 02:11:58,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, ready to start the clock and go.

1613
02:11:58,780 --> 02:12:00,661
[SPEAKER_07]: What year was Akira Yamaoka born?

1614
02:12:01,662 --> 02:12:00,661
1968.

1615
02:12:03,564 --> 02:12:06,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, what town was he born in?

1616
02:12:10,510 --> 02:12:12,091
[SPEAKER_15]: Nagasaki, Japan.

1617
02:12:12,371 --> 02:12:14,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, what is his favorite movie?

1618
02:12:15,354 --> 02:12:16,134
[SPEAKER_15]: Battle Royale.

1619
02:12:17,635 --> 02:12:19,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, what instrument does he play?

1620
02:12:21,258 --> 02:12:21,799
[SPEAKER_15]: Keyboard.

1621
02:12:22,515 --> 02:12:23,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

1622
02:12:23,256 --> 02:12:23,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Guitar.

1623
02:12:25,057 --> 02:12:26,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we have to take your first one.

1624
02:12:27,538 --> 02:12:28,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Which was keyboard, yeah.

1625
02:12:28,619 --> 02:12:32,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, okay, and the last question is... Oh, that's it?

1626
02:12:32,842 --> 02:12:34,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, whoops, that's four questions.

1627
02:12:34,963 --> 02:12:36,124
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, no I don't.

1628
02:12:36,484 --> 02:12:37,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so that's four questions.

1629
02:12:37,865 --> 02:12:39,727
[SPEAKER_07]: You got none of them right.

1630
02:12:40,667 --> 02:12:41,607
[SPEAKER_15]: What a surprise.

1631
02:12:43,128 --> 02:12:43,608
[SPEAKER_15]: Who is that?

1632
02:12:43,688 --> 02:12:46,369
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that like a person on 2DX or something?

1633
02:12:46,909 --> 02:12:47,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you kidding me?

1634
02:12:48,090 --> 02:12:49,210
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not.

1635
02:12:49,690 --> 02:12:51,031
[SPEAKER_07]: He does the music in 2DX.

1636
02:12:51,571 --> 02:12:51,991
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't know that.

1637
02:12:52,011 --> 02:12:52,892
[SPEAKER_07]: He does some music in 2DX.

1638
02:12:53,152 --> 02:12:56,253
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Bradley, yeah.

1639
02:12:58,180 --> 02:12:58,981
[SPEAKER_15]: I kicked ass, dude.

1640
02:12:59,001 --> 02:13:01,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Bradley's, like, coming running, like, from around the corner.

1641
02:13:01,343 --> 02:13:02,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo-hoo!

1642
02:13:02,504 --> 02:13:03,445
[SPEAKER_07]: You won, Bradley!

1643
02:13:03,645 --> 02:13:04,025
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

1644
02:13:04,405 --> 02:13:07,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, just to give you confidence, he didn't get any of them right.

1645
02:13:08,629 --> 02:13:11,271
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, okay.

1646
02:13:12,633 --> 02:13:14,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I mean, he got all of them right.

1647
02:13:14,834 --> 02:13:15,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn.

1648
02:13:17,497 --> 02:13:17,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1649
02:13:19,018 --> 02:13:19,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you ready?

1650
02:13:19,759 --> 02:13:19,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1651
02:13:22,282 --> 02:13:24,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Ok, so start the 30 seconds now.

1652
02:13:24,603 --> 02:13:27,384
[SPEAKER_07]: What year was Akira Yamaoka born?

1653
02:13:27,724 --> 02:13:28,044
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1654
02:13:28,104 --> 02:13:29,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Ok, what city was he born in?

1655
02:13:29,525 --> 02:13:29,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Okinawa.

1656
02:13:29,825 --> 02:13:32,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Ok, what's his favorite movie?

1657
02:13:32,166 --> 02:13:34,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Pulp Fiction.

1658
02:13:34,667 --> 02:13:35,688
[SPEAKER_07]: What instrument does he play?

1659
02:13:35,728 --> 02:13:35,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Violin.

1660
02:13:52,017 --> 02:13:55,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, what 2DX video in 8th style does he appear in?

1661
02:14:05,367 --> 02:14:08,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh, okay, you both got none of them right.

1662
02:14:08,528 --> 02:14:10,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, there was five questions.

1663
02:14:10,309 --> 02:14:11,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, what, okay.

1664
02:14:11,609 --> 02:14:12,589
[SPEAKER_15]: How many questions did he answer?

1665
02:14:12,989 --> 02:14:13,770
[SPEAKER_15]: None, none of them right.

1666
02:14:13,790 --> 02:14:14,990
[SPEAKER_15]: No, how many questions did he get?

1667
02:14:15,070 --> 02:14:15,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, five.

1668
02:14:15,890 --> 02:14:16,991
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, he got to the fifth question?

1669
02:14:17,011 --> 02:14:18,031
[SPEAKER_07]: He got to the fifth question, yeah.

1670
02:14:18,051 --> 02:14:19,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you suck, you read faster for him.

1671
02:14:19,352 --> 02:14:21,412
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I just, I had to, I can't remember.

1672
02:14:21,532 --> 02:14:22,212
[SPEAKER_07]: But, okay, let me.

1673
02:14:22,232 --> 02:14:22,873
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Hispanic.

1674
02:14:24,631 --> 02:14:28,492
[SPEAKER_21]: I think I know the last two for sure, but I don't know about the other ones.

1675
02:14:28,512 --> 02:14:29,392
[SPEAKER_07]: What year was he born?

1676
02:14:29,953 --> 02:14:33,674
[SPEAKER_21]: I would say he's probably in his 20s, which would mean he was probably born in 73.

1677
02:14:34,774 --> 02:14:35,094
[SPEAKER_21]: What was it?

1678
02:14:35,114 --> 02:14:35,974
[SPEAKER_07]: He was born in 1967.

1679
02:14:38,115 --> 02:14:38,635
[SPEAKER_07]: One year off.

1680
02:14:39,015 --> 02:14:42,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, what city was he born in?

1681
02:14:42,576 --> 02:14:44,217
[SPEAKER_21]: I would just go generic and say Tokyo.

1682
02:14:44,277 --> 02:14:44,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you're right.

1683
02:14:46,277 --> 02:14:47,418
[SPEAKER_07]: What is his favorite movie?

1684
02:14:48,438 --> 02:14:49,038
[SPEAKER_07]: You know this.

1685
02:14:49,648 --> 02:14:50,449
[SPEAKER_07]: You like the movie.

1686
02:14:50,769 --> 02:14:51,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Lesbians.

1687
02:14:51,969 --> 02:14:52,530
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, Bound.

1688
02:14:52,550 --> 02:14:53,450
[SPEAKER_21]: You told me that.

1689
02:14:53,490 --> 02:14:54,071
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

1690
02:14:54,151 --> 02:14:54,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Bound.

1691
02:14:54,491 --> 02:14:56,192
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon.

1692
02:14:57,352 --> 02:14:58,113
[SPEAKER_07]: It's his favorite.

1693
02:14:59,153 --> 02:15:00,394
[SPEAKER_21]: Bound is an awesome movie.

1694
02:15:00,414 --> 02:15:00,594
[SPEAKER_21]: Huh?

1695
02:15:01,975 --> 02:15:02,195
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure.

1696
02:15:03,876 --> 02:15:07,178
[SPEAKER_07]: He's mimicking Bound.

1697
02:15:07,198 --> 02:15:08,439
[SPEAKER_07]: What instrument does he play?

1698
02:15:08,459 --> 02:15:09,139
[SPEAKER_07]: He plays the drums.

1699
02:15:09,660 --> 02:15:10,160
[SPEAKER_07]: No, he doesn't.

1700
02:15:10,460 --> 02:15:11,741
[SPEAKER_07]: He plays the guitar.

1701
02:15:12,621 --> 02:15:13,822
We confirmed that the guitarist.

1702
02:15:15,843 --> 02:15:17,364
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, but okay, but the last one.

1703
02:15:17,544 --> 02:15:19,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Last one is what video does he appear in?

1704
02:15:19,206 --> 02:15:20,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Dancer, I knew that.

1705
02:15:20,227 --> 02:15:20,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1706
02:15:20,587 --> 02:15:22,489
[SPEAKER_21]: But somebody told me he played the drums in Dancer.

1707
02:15:23,410 --> 02:15:23,911
[SPEAKER_21]: Who lied?

1708
02:15:25,592 --> 02:15:25,693
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh.

1709
02:15:25,893 --> 02:15:27,655
[SPEAKER_07]: You know who it is, the person that told you.

1710
02:15:32,540 --> 02:15:35,401
[SPEAKER_07]: But his main instrument is the guitar.

1711
02:15:35,501 --> 02:15:37,221
[SPEAKER_21]: Wait, but I thought he played the drums.

1712
02:15:38,441 --> 02:15:39,181
[SPEAKER_21]: The skin flute.

1713
02:15:40,002 --> 02:15:40,382
[SPEAKER_21]: Close.

1714
02:15:41,142 --> 02:15:42,142
[SPEAKER_21]: Which guitarist is he?

1715
02:15:42,182 --> 02:15:43,722
[SPEAKER_21]: Is he the one that's doing this thing?

1716
02:15:44,362 --> 02:15:45,543
[SPEAKER_21]: Or is he the one wearing the skirt?

1717
02:15:45,563 --> 02:15:46,563
[SPEAKER_07]: He's the other one.

1718
02:15:46,643 --> 02:15:47,403
[SPEAKER_07]: He's the cool one.

1719
02:15:48,963 --> 02:15:53,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we can show you if you want to watch the video.

1720
02:15:53,744 --> 02:15:54,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really.

1721
02:15:55,285 --> 02:16:02,126
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, that was an exciting piece of... Oh, okay, so... That was Orange Crush.

1722
02:16:05,403 --> 02:16:09,866
[SPEAKER_21]: We hope you enjoyed Orange Crush, but it's over now.

1723
02:16:10,187 --> 02:16:11,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Go and punch, Rob.

1724
02:16:11,708 --> 02:16:15,591
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I feel your tattoo right now.

1725
02:16:16,091 --> 02:16:16,492
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh-oh.

1726
02:16:18,113 --> 02:16:18,893
[SPEAKER_15]: It's skin tone.

1727
02:16:19,254 --> 02:16:19,694
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, no.

1728
02:16:19,734 --> 02:16:21,415
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what the tattoo is.

1729
02:16:21,435 --> 02:16:22,076
[SPEAKER_21]: Skin tone tattoo?

1730
02:16:22,116 --> 02:16:23,337
[SPEAKER_21]: Does this make Anita hot and bothered?

1731
02:16:25,018 --> 02:16:27,140
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, Rob, you have such a sexy touch.

1732
02:16:28,101 --> 02:16:31,964
[SPEAKER_19]: Am I the only one who notices that he doesn't have a tattoo there, and you're just rubbing his bare chest?

1733
02:16:33,292 --> 02:16:45,402
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know anything else to say Hi everyone So Dark Child and Anita, now that you're here, how was your guys' week?

1734
02:16:47,984 --> 02:16:49,906
[SPEAKER_15]: Prior to coming here or after coming here?

1735
02:16:51,287 --> 02:16:56,291
[SPEAKER_21]: Either, both We had a lot of time to fill, so both I don't know Whenever I came

1736
02:16:58,625 --> 02:16:59,906
[SPEAKER_15]: It was pretty good.

1737
02:17:00,307 --> 02:17:01,207
[SPEAKER_15]: Good week, I guess.

1738
02:17:02,208 --> 02:17:03,630
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm still unemployed, which sucks.

1739
02:17:03,790 --> 02:17:06,152
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I guess it was a good week.

1740
02:17:06,572 --> 02:17:07,893
[SPEAKER_15]: Was at the ranch this weekend.

1741
02:17:10,475 --> 02:17:13,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we were at Darkchild's mom's ranch.

1742
02:17:13,358 --> 02:17:14,499
[SPEAKER_06]: We saw horsies.

1743
02:17:14,859 --> 02:17:16,020
[SPEAKER_06]: We saw puppies.

1744
02:17:16,320 --> 02:17:17,461
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't get to ride yet.

1745
02:17:17,561 --> 02:17:18,142
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a tan.

1746
02:17:19,782 --> 02:17:21,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, that's from work actually.

1747
02:17:21,923 --> 02:17:23,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I get to go out in the sun at work.

1748
02:17:24,344 --> 02:17:26,065
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have like sandal tans on my feet.

1749
02:17:27,006 --> 02:17:30,107
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's when I work out on the river and playing with fishies.

1750
02:17:30,407 --> 02:17:31,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

1751
02:17:33,199 --> 02:17:34,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I play with fishies!

1752
02:17:34,700 --> 02:17:36,020
[SPEAKER_06]: I chop them into pieces!

1753
02:17:38,100 --> 02:17:38,961
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're already dead.

1754
02:17:39,561 --> 02:17:41,021
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I should work at a sushi bar.

1755
02:17:41,281 --> 02:17:42,942
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to bring you guys salmon this year.

1756
02:17:43,082 --> 02:17:44,202
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to try.

1757
02:17:44,242 --> 02:17:45,963
[SPEAKER_06]: If you like salmon, I'll bring salmon.

1758
02:17:46,023 --> 02:17:48,263
[SPEAKER_06]: I like food, so any food is cool.

1759
02:17:49,043 --> 02:17:50,044
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be from the hatchery.

1760
02:17:50,544 --> 02:17:51,264
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fresh salmon.

1761
02:17:51,664 --> 02:17:52,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Very, very, very fresh.

1762
02:17:52,364 --> 02:17:53,985
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like mercury salmon, is it?

1763
02:17:54,826 --> 02:18:00,668
[SPEAKER_06]: It's from the Feather River, so it's got... No, they're just coming up from the ocean, so they don't have a lot of mercury.

1764
02:18:00,688 --> 02:18:02,289
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not like a thermometer, are they?

1765
02:18:02,649 --> 02:18:03,730
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not at all.

1766
02:18:04,210 --> 02:18:04,850
[SPEAKER_07]: They're ocean fish.

1767
02:18:04,950 --> 02:18:05,711
[SPEAKER_15]: They're not from the bay.

1768
02:18:06,351 --> 02:18:06,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, right.

1769
02:18:06,931 --> 02:18:11,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they spend most of their life out in the ocean, so most of the food that they eat is mercury-free.

1770
02:18:12,494 --> 02:18:13,494
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're predators.

1771
02:18:13,715 --> 02:18:18,317
[SPEAKER_06]: The only predators that live in the San Francisco Bay that eat the...

1772
02:18:19,037 --> 02:18:22,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Little creatures that are in the San Francisco Bay have a lot of work here, you know.

1773
02:18:22,560 --> 02:18:25,161
[SPEAKER_06]: So, anyway, just, uh, that's a science note.

1774
02:18:25,382 --> 02:18:26,342
[SPEAKER_06]: You're from Science Corner.

1775
02:18:26,662 --> 02:18:27,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Anita's little Science Corner.

1776
02:18:27,863 --> 02:18:29,645
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the science segment.

1777
02:18:30,385 --> 02:18:32,006
[SPEAKER_07]: We do the science segment.

1778
02:18:32,026 --> 02:18:32,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

1779
02:18:32,126 --> 02:18:32,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Got it.

1780
02:18:32,787 --> 02:18:33,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-huh.

1781
02:18:34,568 --> 02:18:39,051
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, other than that, yeah, we had, we saw puppies and we saw horses, because they raise horses and puppies there.

1782
02:18:39,431 --> 02:18:43,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, there's miniature Doberman Pinschers.

1783
02:18:43,934 --> 02:18:47,117
[SPEAKER_15]: Minpins, Doberman Pinschers, and Toy Fox Terriers.

1784
02:18:48,942 --> 02:18:49,782
[SPEAKER_06]: They were very cool.

1785
02:18:49,962 --> 02:18:50,682
[SPEAKER_06]: They were so cute.

1786
02:18:50,702 --> 02:18:51,723
[SPEAKER_06]: We saw little tiny babies.

1787
02:18:51,743 --> 02:18:52,843
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like two weeks old.

1788
02:18:53,763 --> 02:18:55,824
[SPEAKER_06]: So, aww, everybody.

1789
02:18:55,844 --> 02:19:00,205
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, whatever.

1790
02:19:00,825 --> 02:19:01,465
[SPEAKER_15]: Animals, whatever.

1791
02:19:01,605 --> 02:19:02,906
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's old news for me.

1792
02:19:03,046 --> 02:19:04,226
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1793
02:19:04,306 --> 02:19:07,427
[SPEAKER_21]: Anybody have any exciting Bumanu news of our guests that just showed up?

1794
02:19:08,027 --> 02:19:11,648
[SPEAKER_15]: I finally full comboed the Beauty of Silence.

1795
02:19:11,928 --> 02:19:12,428
[SPEAKER_15]: Woo!

1796
02:19:12,828 --> 02:19:13,349
[SPEAKER_15]: You go, boy.

1797
02:19:13,369 --> 02:19:13,549
[SPEAKER_15]: Flight 7.

1798
02:19:13,589 --> 02:19:13,709
[SPEAKER_15]: Woo!

1799
02:19:17,343 --> 02:19:19,706
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no newpamani news.

1800
02:19:20,366 --> 02:19:22,108
[SPEAKER_21]: I've barely played in the past couple weeks.

1801
02:19:23,489 --> 02:19:24,410
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm nuttin' over the game.

1802
02:19:26,051 --> 02:19:27,212
[SPEAKER_15]: All over the keys and everything.

1803
02:19:28,854 --> 02:19:30,235
[SPEAKER_15]: And I play on the left side, Rob.

1804
02:19:30,775 --> 02:19:31,516
[SPEAKER_15]: Just like you.

1805
02:19:31,936 --> 02:19:33,097
[SPEAKER_21]: Yay, left side pride.

1806
02:19:34,358 --> 02:19:35,399
[SPEAKER_21]: Left side represent.

1807
02:19:37,181 --> 02:19:37,661
[SPEAKER_21]: Left side...

1808
02:19:39,838 --> 02:19:42,799
[SPEAKER_21]: See, and we even have, like, gang signs.

1809
02:19:47,501 --> 02:19:55,385
[SPEAKER_06]: As Loki puts his finger and thumb up to his forehead, and everybody's trying different hand signals.

1810
02:19:57,746 --> 02:19:59,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Who else wants a hand signal that I can describe?

1811
02:20:01,427 --> 02:20:06,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, this guy is doing a very interesting little hand signal for the crotch.

1812
02:20:09,751 --> 02:20:11,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Child is licking his nipple.

1813
02:20:11,672 --> 02:20:13,953
[SPEAKER_21]: Discussions on hand signals makes excellent radio, by the way.

1814
02:20:16,974 --> 02:20:18,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you guys already talk about X2?

1815
02:20:18,134 --> 02:20:18,334
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1816
02:20:20,315 --> 02:20:21,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's so good.

1817
02:20:21,255 --> 02:20:21,355
[SPEAKER_06]: X2.

1818
02:20:21,395 --> 02:20:22,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, X2 News.

1819
02:20:22,996 --> 02:20:24,316
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so good.

1820
02:20:25,036 --> 02:20:25,516
[SPEAKER_07]: When what?

1821
02:20:25,536 --> 02:20:27,037
[SPEAKER_07]: It's out already.

1822
02:20:27,057 --> 02:20:27,957
[SPEAKER_21]: Of course, we don't spoil.

1823
02:20:27,977 --> 02:20:29,438
[SPEAKER_21]: Spoiler-free review, please.

1824
02:20:29,558 --> 02:20:30,058
[SPEAKER_19]: We never spoil.

1825
02:20:30,078 --> 02:20:30,958
[SPEAKER_06]: It came out on Friday.

1826
02:20:33,539 --> 02:20:34,559
[SPEAKER_06]: X-Men 2, the movie?

1827
02:20:34,579 --> 02:20:35,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1828
02:20:35,820 --> 02:20:36,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on, Irene.

1829
02:20:37,080 --> 02:20:38,941
[SPEAKER_19]: Irene's having a conversation with Matt, who doesn't have a mic.

1830
02:20:41,934 --> 02:20:46,900
[SPEAKER_19]: Dark Child asked something that's not exactly a spoiler, but should I give this information out?

1831
02:20:46,920 --> 02:20:47,501
[SPEAKER_19]: Does everybody agree?

1832
02:20:47,561 --> 02:20:48,142
[SPEAKER_19]: What is the question?

1833
02:20:48,162 --> 02:20:49,604
[SPEAKER_19]: He asked if Gambit is in the movie.

1834
02:20:50,164 --> 02:20:51,887
[SPEAKER_19]: Gambit's scene was cut from the movie.

1835
02:20:52,888 --> 02:20:53,469
[SPEAKER_19]: I agree.

1836
02:20:53,749 --> 02:20:54,350
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh is right.

1837
02:20:55,405 --> 02:20:57,226
[SPEAKER_19]: Shiesty Marvel pieces of shit!

1838
02:20:57,286 --> 02:21:00,828
[SPEAKER_19]: It even says, it even... Sorry, we're being loud.

1839
02:21:01,088 --> 02:21:07,172
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, no, his scene, I was very pissed off, dude, because I was looking everywhere for it, and I didn't see him.

1840
02:21:08,012 --> 02:21:14,936
[SPEAKER_19]: And it says Beast is in there, but I didn't see Beast, but somebody pointed out to me later on that he was in the form of, like, his normal human, because he uses...

1841
02:21:16,607 --> 02:21:17,488
[SPEAKER_19]: No, no, no, no, no.

1842
02:21:17,688 --> 02:21:19,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Beast wasn't in his human form, I don't think.

1843
02:21:19,769 --> 02:21:23,811
[SPEAKER_19]: Not human form, but he has like an image thing that can make him look like a normal human, I think.

1844
02:21:24,132 --> 02:21:24,892
[SPEAKER_07]: He was on the news.

1845
02:21:25,092 --> 02:21:27,154
[SPEAKER_19]: He was on the news as Dr. McCoy or whatever, so.

1846
02:21:27,614 --> 02:21:28,795
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, what to look out for?

1847
02:21:29,175 --> 02:21:29,655
[SPEAKER_19]: Nightcrawler.

1848
02:21:30,015 --> 02:21:30,456
[SPEAKER_19]: Excellent.

1849
02:21:30,716 --> 02:21:32,437
[SPEAKER_19]: Nightcrawler's one of probably the best characters in the movie.

1850
02:21:32,457 --> 02:21:32,537
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1851
02:21:32,577 --> 02:21:34,118
[SPEAKER_19]: You'll see some great scenes with him.

1852
02:21:34,158 --> 02:21:34,718
[SPEAKER_00]: Kick ass.

1853
02:21:35,078 --> 02:21:38,160
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's more, it seems more adult.

1854
02:21:38,180 --> 02:21:41,362
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a lot more violence, there's some swearing in it, so great stuff.

1855
02:21:41,402 --> 02:21:42,883
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys should really run out and watch it.

1856
02:21:43,444 --> 02:21:45,465
[SPEAKER_19]: And just hope that the power doesn't go out at the theater.

1857
02:21:46,553 --> 02:21:48,214
[SPEAKER_21]: That was the FU of the week I forgot about.

1858
02:21:48,314 --> 02:21:51,375
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I got to go to the movie theaters to go see X2.

1859
02:21:51,455 --> 02:21:53,176
[SPEAKER_21]: We went to go see it over at Truxel.

1860
02:21:53,196 --> 02:21:54,277
[SPEAKER_21]: It's right by Arco Arena.

1861
02:21:54,457 --> 02:21:55,517
[SPEAKER_21]: That's something everybody knows about.

1862
02:21:56,418 --> 02:22:00,299
[SPEAKER_21]: Right by Arco Arena, there's a huge movie theater, and we went to go see X2 over there, and it was great.

1863
02:22:00,540 --> 02:22:13,906
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, we bought the tickets off online, the online site where you can buy tickets, and we went, and we had to stand in this huge-ass line, and we were kind of towards the back waiting to get into the theater, but then one of the friends, a friend that I went to the theater with,

1864
02:22:14,506 --> 02:22:20,556
[SPEAKER_21]: He has a friend that works at the theater So we got to cut to the front of the line We got to go to the VIP side So we were the first ones in the theater

1865
02:22:21,272 --> 02:22:22,853
[SPEAKER_21]: So we got to go in and pick any seat we wanted.

1866
02:22:23,193 --> 02:22:26,354
[SPEAKER_21]: So we sat right in the middle where you can put your feet up.

1867
02:22:26,474 --> 02:22:28,494
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like right where the stadium seating part begins.

1868
02:22:28,514 --> 02:22:29,795
[SPEAKER_21]: You can put your feet up on the bars and stuff.

1869
02:22:30,095 --> 02:22:30,555
[SPEAKER_21]: We're sitting there.

1870
02:22:30,575 --> 02:22:31,215
[SPEAKER_21]: We're getting excited.

1871
02:22:31,235 --> 02:22:32,036
[SPEAKER_21]: The movie's about to start.

1872
02:22:32,536 --> 02:22:35,817
[SPEAKER_21]: Five minutes before the movie starts, all the lights go out and the emergency lights come on.

1873
02:22:36,157 --> 02:22:36,637
[SPEAKER_21]: We're sorry.

1874
02:22:36,657 --> 02:22:37,397
[SPEAKER_21]: The power's out.

1875
02:22:38,338 --> 02:22:39,478
[SPEAKER_21]: And how long was it out for?

1876
02:22:40,658 --> 02:22:45,840
[SPEAKER_21]: Long enough so that they escorted us out of the theater and gave us tickets to see another movie at another time.

1877
02:22:46,760 --> 02:22:48,181
[SPEAKER_19]: So what a waste of two hours.

1878
02:22:48,741 --> 02:22:49,781
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you go back in and watch it?

1879
02:22:50,322 --> 02:22:51,022
[SPEAKER_19]: No, we couldn't.

1880
02:22:51,202 --> 02:22:51,862
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, okay.

1881
02:22:52,102 --> 02:22:54,323
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, I thought when you... They closed theaters for the night.

1882
02:22:54,583 --> 02:22:57,624
[SPEAKER_19]: You had called me earlier or later, and I thought you said that they started to move it up.

1883
02:22:57,785 --> 02:22:58,105
[SPEAKER_21]: No, no.

1884
02:22:58,345 --> 02:23:03,067
[SPEAKER_21]: The manager came in and was shooing us all out, so that really sucked.

1885
02:23:03,487 --> 02:23:12,030
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I have some friends that went to go see it that same day, but they were in the theater a little earlier, so they were halfway through the movie when the car went out.

1886
02:23:12,050 --> 02:23:12,090
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh.

1887
02:23:14,151 --> 02:23:16,033
[SPEAKER_21]: I was saying it's gotta really suck to be those guys.

1888
02:23:16,053 --> 02:23:17,333
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why I was telling my friend that I went with.

1889
02:23:18,114 --> 02:23:21,236
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, it sucks for us, but it really sucks for them.

1890
02:23:21,316 --> 02:23:22,977
[SPEAKER_21]: Like when I went and saw Princess Mononoke.

1891
02:23:24,298 --> 02:23:25,119
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

1892
02:23:25,619 --> 02:23:28,341
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob, you reminded me of one of my fuck you's I need to say for the week.

1893
02:23:29,301 --> 02:23:30,542
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck you to Bombay.

1894
02:23:31,543 --> 02:23:35,926
[SPEAKER_15]: See, Bombay, he didn't get to go to see the premiere of it on Thursday.

1895
02:23:36,431 --> 02:23:37,352
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got tickets for 545 opening day.

1896
02:23:59,952 --> 02:24:00,613
[SPEAKER_19]: 5.45 opening day.

1897
02:24:01,113 --> 02:24:02,474
[SPEAKER_19]: I better get some tickets too so we can go.

1898
02:24:03,215 --> 02:24:06,076
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, Loki, I'm going to have premiere passes.

1899
02:24:07,137 --> 02:24:07,677
[SPEAKER_19]: So what?

1900
02:24:07,737 --> 02:24:08,298
[SPEAKER_19]: Do I care?

1901
02:24:08,318 --> 02:24:09,979
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you sure you can get in with premiere passes?

1902
02:24:11,140 --> 02:24:14,342
[SPEAKER_19]: Usually they don't let you use any kind of passes on brand new movies until two weeks.

1903
02:24:15,402 --> 02:24:16,643
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, okay, radio station premiere.

1904
02:24:19,565 --> 02:24:21,386
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yeah, I guess premiere.

1905
02:24:21,426 --> 02:24:22,987
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to see that movie so badly.

1906
02:24:23,288 --> 02:24:24,128
[SPEAKER_19]: I know, everybody.

1907
02:24:24,168 --> 02:24:25,309
[SPEAKER_20]: Counting down seconds.

1908
02:24:26,380 --> 02:24:28,341
[SPEAKER_19]: That movie's gonna fuckin' make me piss my pants.

1909
02:24:29,222 --> 02:24:30,463
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm gonna have to bring a new pair of shorts.

1910
02:24:31,023 --> 02:24:32,524
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm gonna see that movie, like, eight times.

1911
02:24:33,925 --> 02:24:37,628
[SPEAKER_19]: You're one of those weird people who's gonna dress up in, like, the black trench coat and the glasses.

1912
02:24:37,848 --> 02:24:39,209
[SPEAKER_19]: I already own that, shut up.

1913
02:24:42,091 --> 02:24:44,413
[SPEAKER_15]: I normally wear a trench coat, so... Shut up.

1914
02:24:44,433 --> 02:24:45,954
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not a trench coat!

1915
02:24:46,634 --> 02:24:47,795
[SPEAKER_15]: Trench coats go down to your ankle.

1916
02:24:49,636 --> 02:24:52,700
[SPEAKER_19]: At least I don't have the glasses that don't have like the side arm thing.

1917
02:24:52,720 --> 02:24:55,103
[SPEAKER_19]: They just stick onto your nose like Morpheus had.

1918
02:24:55,743 --> 02:24:56,925
[SPEAKER_15]: Morpheus glasses are pimps.

1919
02:24:56,965 --> 02:24:58,807
[SPEAKER_15]: Too bad they're $300 so I can't afford them.

1920
02:24:59,468 --> 02:25:01,671
[SPEAKER_19]: Go get some knockoffs in Mexico or something, I'm sure.

1921
02:25:03,035 --> 02:25:05,236
[SPEAKER_20]: Yo, look at me as the lens pops out.

1922
02:25:07,617 --> 02:25:08,458
[SPEAKER_20]: Yo, yo.

1923
02:25:10,399 --> 02:25:13,660
[SPEAKER_19]: Would you like to go deeper down the rabbit hole or whatever the fuck you said?

1924
02:25:14,061 --> 02:25:14,501
[SPEAKER_21]: Cornhole?

1925
02:25:14,641 --> 02:25:27,327
[SPEAKER_21]: I was reading some review on ain'titcoolnews.com where this guy just kept overusing the words fuck and cum and pissed myself like in his review of Matrix Reloaded because I guess it's been screened already at Cannes Film Festival and stuff.

1926
02:25:27,428 --> 02:25:28,968
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that's funny.

1927
02:25:30,189 --> 02:25:31,069
[SPEAKER_19]: How mature.

1928
02:25:31,089 --> 02:25:31,970
[SPEAKER_19]: I know.

1929
02:25:34,045 --> 02:25:35,246
[SPEAKER_19]: It was probably one of the... Tee hee.

1930
02:25:35,506 --> 02:25:36,367
[SPEAKER_19]: I said fuck.

1931
02:25:37,008 --> 02:25:39,370
[SPEAKER_19]: It was probably, uh... What's his name?

1932
02:25:39,390 --> 02:25:43,614
[SPEAKER_19]: The one of the... Ah, one of those... One of the guys died.

1933
02:25:43,954 --> 02:25:44,695
[SPEAKER_19]: The two movie critics.

1934
02:25:45,836 --> 02:25:46,537
[SPEAKER_19]: Siskel and Ebert.

1935
02:25:46,677 --> 02:25:47,398
[SPEAKER_19]: Which one's still alive?

1936
02:25:47,418 --> 02:25:48,799
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, Ebert and Roper.

1937
02:25:48,819 --> 02:25:49,660
[SPEAKER_19]: No, now it's Ebert and Roper.

1938
02:25:49,840 --> 02:25:50,821
[SPEAKER_19]: It was probably Ebert who did it.

1939
02:25:50,861 --> 02:25:52,342
[SPEAKER_19]: He's all... Shit, fuck, come...

1940
02:25:54,244 --> 02:25:55,887
[SPEAKER_21]: There's one thing I don't want to think about.

1941
02:25:56,527 --> 02:25:57,248
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1942
02:25:57,289 --> 02:25:59,712
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm at a river, at a pretty lake, pretty lake.

1943
02:26:06,504 --> 02:26:10,987
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was too lazy to write up another review, so he just copied the one from the porn movie and used it for the Matrix.

1944
02:26:11,047 --> 02:26:15,111
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, he posted a porn movie review and he thought, you know, because he didn't want to make up a Matrix review.

1945
02:26:15,131 --> 02:26:16,572
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's why it said that.

1946
02:26:16,852 --> 02:26:17,913
[SPEAKER_15]: It was probably a scat film.

1947
02:26:18,193 --> 02:26:27,581
[SPEAKER_19]: And they just changed the names of the characters to, like, Neo and... When Neo took Morpheus from behind, it was the most excellent scene I ever saw in my life.

1948
02:26:28,021 --> 02:26:29,222
[SPEAKER_19]: The anal Matrix.

1949
02:26:31,284 --> 02:26:33,105
[SPEAKER_19]: Would you like to go deeper down the hole?

1950
02:26:35,407 --> 02:26:36,768
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's see how far this hole takes you.

1951
02:26:37,589 --> 02:26:37,929
[SPEAKER_19]: Whoa!

1952
02:26:40,511 --> 02:26:41,151
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Kung Fu.

1953
02:26:42,312 --> 02:26:43,553
[SPEAKER_19]: Eleventy billion dollars.

1954
02:26:44,334 --> 02:26:44,614
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1955
02:26:46,735 --> 02:26:47,196
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway.

1956
02:26:48,997 --> 02:26:50,598
[SPEAKER_19]: So go see Mex- Ex- Mex- Whoa.

1957
02:26:50,998 --> 02:26:51,879
[SPEAKER_14]: I know GHB.

1958
02:26:55,931 --> 02:26:56,811
[SPEAKER_20]: X-Men 2 X-Men 2

1959
02:27:25,222 --> 02:27:26,222
[SPEAKER_19]: No, this is the Clerks Animated.

1960
02:27:26,242 --> 02:27:28,062
[SPEAKER_19]: No, Clerks Animated, another thing everybody should watch.

1961
02:27:29,023 --> 02:27:33,483
[SPEAKER_19]: Regardless if you're fans of Kevin Smith or the Clerks or not, it's one of the greatest cartoons ever.

1962
02:27:33,883 --> 02:27:37,164
[SPEAKER_19]: Proof that the greatest shows get kicked off TV all the time.

1963
02:27:38,044 --> 02:27:38,984
[SPEAKER_19]: Like Family Guy.

1964
02:27:39,004 --> 02:27:42,425
[SPEAKER_19]: Family Guy at least got more play than... Invader Zim.

1965
02:27:42,445 --> 02:27:44,325
[SPEAKER_19]: Invader Zim got like a couple seasons too though, didn't it?

1966
02:27:44,445 --> 02:27:52,307
[SPEAKER_20]: It got two seasons before John Vasquez pulled it off because Nickelodeon is trying to make it more kid-friendly.

1967
02:27:52,587 --> 02:27:54,407
[SPEAKER_15]: Comedy Central is supposed to be picking up Clerks.

1968
02:27:55,257 --> 02:28:03,524
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sure they'll show the first six, but maybe, hopefully.

1969
02:28:04,144 --> 02:28:06,586
[SPEAKER_15]: But Kevin Smith said there's no more Jay and Silent Bob in anything.

1970
02:28:08,067 --> 02:28:11,210
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, that's a lie already, because they are doing a Clerks animated movie.

1971
02:28:12,130 --> 02:28:14,732
[SPEAKER_19]: And so I'm sure Jay and Silent Bob have to be in that.

1972
02:28:14,752 --> 02:28:19,136
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, the only reason they're doing no Jay and Silent Bob is because Jay's missing in action.

1973
02:28:19,176 --> 02:28:19,716
[SPEAKER_20]: Jay, yeah.

1974
02:28:20,437 --> 02:28:20,577
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1975
02:28:22,273 --> 02:28:22,773
[SPEAKER_20]: What happened?

1976
02:28:23,233 --> 02:28:24,034
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

1977
02:28:24,154 --> 02:28:24,674
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think they know.

1978
02:28:24,694 --> 02:28:27,075
[SPEAKER_19]: Did he turn tail and run out of the country, is what I heard?

1979
02:28:27,415 --> 02:28:28,515
[SPEAKER_19]: Out of the country, he's dead.

1980
02:28:29,296 --> 02:28:30,016
[SPEAKER_19]: He's not dead.

1981
02:28:30,096 --> 02:28:34,778
[SPEAKER_19]: He's hiding on some island somewhere because of his convictions or whatever.

1982
02:28:35,778 --> 02:28:37,059
[SPEAKER_19]: Conviction, that's not the right word, is it?

1983
02:28:37,079 --> 02:28:37,519
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

1984
02:28:38,259 --> 02:28:42,061
[SPEAKER_15]: Didn't he talk about Jason Mewes being banished on an evening with Kevin Smith?

1985
02:28:42,701 --> 02:28:43,001
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

1986
02:28:43,041 --> 02:28:47,883
[SPEAKER_15]: At Ghost Ward, he brought that up, and then Jason Mewes walks up on stage, and he knows where Jason is.

1987
02:28:50,417 --> 02:28:54,518
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like one of the biggest conspiracies since like the whole Biggie, Notorious B.I.G.

1988
02:28:54,558 --> 02:28:55,498
[SPEAKER_19]: and Tupac thing, you know?

1989
02:28:55,958 --> 02:28:56,878
[SPEAKER_19]: Is he really dead?

1990
02:28:58,779 --> 02:29:00,779
[SPEAKER_15]: I just think Jay ran off with Boo Boo Kitty Fuck.

1991
02:29:03,019 --> 02:29:04,600
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, I don't know who Boo Boo Kitty Fuck is.

1992
02:29:07,300 --> 02:29:09,360
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, I think he ran off with Strong Bad.

1993
02:29:11,601 --> 02:29:18,202
[SPEAKER_19]: So, on another note... Rob's over here eating fucking pretzels.

1994
02:29:18,242 --> 02:29:18,782
[SPEAKER_19]: Do your job.

1995
02:29:19,665 --> 02:29:20,145
[SPEAKER_19]: What job?

1996
02:29:21,886 --> 02:29:23,387
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, we're going to go to a break real fast.

1997
02:29:24,387 --> 02:29:25,268
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we're going to come back.

1998
02:29:28,590 --> 02:29:32,011
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I've been making my living with the kind of job we call blow.

1999
02:29:36,293 --> 02:29:36,954
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, yes.

2000
02:29:39,315 --> 02:29:39,995
[SPEAKER_21]: We go to break now.

2001
02:29:40,596 --> 02:29:44,858
[SPEAKER_21]: And after break, we're going to come back with Ask Orange Lounge.

2002
02:29:45,999 --> 02:29:49,500
[SPEAKER_21]: Where you can ask any of the members of Orange Lounge a question that you want.

2003
02:29:50,460 --> 02:29:51,860
[SPEAKER_21]: Except Jamie, because she's not here right now.

2004
02:29:52,180 --> 02:29:53,561
[SPEAKER_21]: But you can ask me, you can ask Loki.

2005
02:29:53,901 --> 02:29:56,501
[SPEAKER_21]: You can ask RicePrincess or LankyStyle.

2006
02:29:56,821 --> 02:29:58,562
[SPEAKER_21]: You can ask DarkChild or DDRholic.

2007
02:29:58,602 --> 02:29:59,602
[SPEAKER_21]: You can ask Arcadian42.

2008
02:30:00,082 --> 02:30:03,043
[SPEAKER_21]: Or you can ask the Ice Princess.

2009
02:30:04,323 --> 02:30:05,163
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, sorry, the Ice Queen.

2010
02:30:05,543 --> 02:30:06,843
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry, are you a princess or a queen?

2011
02:30:07,823 --> 02:30:08,304
[SPEAKER_21]: He's a queen.

2012
02:30:08,344 --> 02:30:14,125
[SPEAKER_21]: He's more of a queen than a... Well, then you're definitely a queen.

2013
02:30:16,331 --> 02:30:18,373
[SPEAKER_21]: Vanessa May with Destiny

2014
02:30:45,808 --> 02:30:46,370
This is my destiny.

2015
02:31:17,690 --> 02:31:18,691
Thanks for watching!

2016
02:32:45,827 --> 02:32:46,833
Thanks for watching!

2017
02:33:19,591 --> 02:33:20,692
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

2018
02:36:13,039 --> 02:36:13,906
Thank you for watching

2019
02:36:56,775 --> 02:37:05,339
[SPEAKER_12]: Hiho, Kermit the Fog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

2020
02:37:05,459 --> 02:37:11,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

2021
02:37:14,283 --> 02:37:20,145
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello, we're back, and you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 43, and, um...

2022
02:37:24,306 --> 02:37:25,427
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi Irene, how are you doing?

2023
02:37:25,567 --> 02:37:26,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, I'm pretty good.

2024
02:37:26,227 --> 02:37:26,708
[SPEAKER_07]: How about you?

2025
02:37:26,828 --> 02:37:27,448
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty good.

2026
02:37:27,468 --> 02:37:28,369
[SPEAKER_07]: I love your shirt.

2027
02:37:28,649 --> 02:37:29,209
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2028
02:37:29,670 --> 02:37:30,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you tell everyone about Rocky?

2029
02:37:31,671 --> 02:37:32,351
[SPEAKER_21]: What about Rocky?

2030
02:37:32,812 --> 02:37:36,094
[SPEAKER_07]: About Rocky, how it's going to be on May 10th at Davis.

2031
02:37:36,114 --> 02:37:44,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you have to remember we're an international show, but if anybody's local to Sacramento... It's going to be at the Campus Cinema at UC Davis, Chem Lab 194.

2032
02:37:45,420 --> 02:37:47,421
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it used to be, but now it's an actual theater.

2033
02:37:48,542 --> 02:37:51,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're doing Rocky at midnight on Saturday, May 10th.

2034
02:37:52,200 --> 02:37:53,141
[SPEAKER_15]: At the theater in Davis?

2035
02:37:53,622 --> 02:37:59,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually, no, it's on the campus, but they changed the Chem Lab 194 to an actual theater.

2036
02:37:59,527 --> 02:38:00,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

2037
02:38:00,488 --> 02:38:01,529
[SPEAKER_07]: What building is that?

2038
02:38:01,749 --> 02:38:02,149
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you know?

2039
02:38:03,290 --> 02:38:03,690
[SPEAKER_07]: You would know.

2040
02:38:07,094 --> 02:38:09,436
[SPEAKER_18]: 194, it's the big chem building.

2041
02:38:10,697 --> 02:38:11,537
[SPEAKER_18]: Right by the chem building.

2042
02:38:11,558 --> 02:38:12,739
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like really big.

2043
02:38:12,799 --> 02:38:14,240
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like across from the silo.

2044
02:38:18,862 --> 02:38:20,202
[SPEAKER_07]: It's where the soccer field is.

2045
02:38:20,222 --> 02:38:22,123
[SPEAKER_07]: There were soccer people playing.

2046
02:38:23,944 --> 02:38:25,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Student Union and the Taco Bell.

2047
02:38:26,905 --> 02:38:27,866
[SPEAKER_18]: I never went to this.

2048
02:38:29,247 --> 02:38:30,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he would know or not.

2049
02:38:31,088 --> 02:38:32,588
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you know where the Student Union is.

2050
02:38:32,708 --> 02:38:36,330
[SPEAKER_18]: You go basically... I can't remember the directions.

2051
02:38:36,350 --> 02:38:38,751
[SPEAKER_07]: We can give directions later, but if you're interested, email someone.

2052
02:38:38,771 --> 02:38:40,752
[SPEAKER_18]: If you go to vtour.ucdavis.edu, you can look on the map there.

2053
02:38:40,772 --> 02:38:40,972
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2054
02:38:46,471 --> 02:38:49,253
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so as I said, it's time for Ask Orange Lounge.

2055
02:38:54,796 --> 02:38:55,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Ask Orange Lounge.

2056
02:38:55,696 --> 02:38:56,016
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

2057
02:38:56,036 --> 02:38:56,837
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to sing this.

2058
02:38:56,977 --> 02:38:57,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2059
02:38:57,597 --> 02:38:59,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, you need to make new theme songs.

2060
02:38:59,478 --> 02:38:59,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I know.

2061
02:38:59,978 --> 02:39:00,839
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, here we go.

2062
02:39:00,859 --> 02:39:09,904
[SPEAKER_21]: First question is from Justin B., and he wants to know, will you play some of those cool songs I sent you, like Speed Over Beethoven, Living in America, Hungarian Dance No.

2063
02:39:09,924 --> 02:39:11,064
[SPEAKER_21]: 5, Mary Blonde, I Love You?

2064
02:39:11,084 --> 02:39:11,285
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

2065
02:39:12,930 --> 02:39:14,751
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, this is the problem.

2066
02:39:15,131 --> 02:39:21,114
[SPEAKER_21]: While I want to honor that request and let everybody hear, because it's some rare stuff, it's some cool stuff.

2067
02:39:21,154 --> 02:39:23,095
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not from SyFam, it's from LED Records.

2068
02:39:23,135 --> 02:39:23,975
[SPEAKER_21]: I fucked that up earlier.

2069
02:39:24,435 --> 02:39:30,778
[SPEAKER_21]: But the problem is, when I played that one a little while ago, half the chat room was like, you know, they were going into convulsions.

2070
02:39:30,818 --> 02:39:32,459
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm kind of at a tough space here.

2071
02:39:32,819 --> 02:39:34,100
[SPEAKER_21]: So yes, we'll play them.

2072
02:39:35,084 --> 02:39:38,527
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll intermix them with the other stuff, but we can't play them all in one big clump.

2073
02:39:41,329 --> 02:39:44,351
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki says we can play them on February 30th.

2074
02:39:44,711 --> 02:39:46,052
[SPEAKER_21]: No, we'll play some after the show.

2075
02:39:46,072 --> 02:39:48,434
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll intermix it in with our typical Bomani music.

2076
02:39:48,474 --> 02:39:48,834
[SPEAKER_21]: How's that?

2077
02:39:49,014 --> 02:39:49,815
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll compromise.

2078
02:39:50,475 --> 02:39:52,757
[SPEAKER_21]: Because there are some folks out there that like that stuff, which is cool.

2079
02:39:52,797 --> 02:39:53,417
[SPEAKER_21]: I like some of it.

2080
02:39:53,437 --> 02:39:55,178
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't like all of it, but I like some of it.

2081
02:39:55,218 --> 02:39:57,300
[SPEAKER_21]: But there was some good sounding stuff in there.

2082
02:39:58,203 --> 02:39:59,503
[SPEAKER_21]: So, we shall soon see.

2083
02:39:59,523 --> 02:40:00,043
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, Rob?

2084
02:40:00,283 --> 02:40:00,483
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes?

2085
02:40:00,964 --> 02:40:02,004
[SPEAKER_15]: I like kinky sex.

2086
02:40:02,064 --> 02:40:06,625
[SPEAKER_15]: Are we going to compromise and allow me to have kinky sex on the show every now and then and mix that into the weekly programming?

2087
02:40:06,825 --> 02:40:08,005
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, we might be able to arrange that.

2088
02:40:08,305 --> 02:40:09,865
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, we'll boost our ratings.

2089
02:40:09,885 --> 02:40:09,965
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

2090
02:40:12,026 --> 02:40:12,806
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, let's see.

2091
02:40:13,006 --> 02:40:15,466
[SPEAKER_21]: This is a question probably Loki would be best to answer.

2092
02:40:15,666 --> 02:40:16,946
[SPEAKER_21]: This one for Loki.

2093
02:40:17,266 --> 02:40:25,568
[SPEAKER_21]: This is from SnubDisponoid, and he wants to know, Does the PSX dex drive not work with Windblow's XP, or does mine just hate me?

2094
02:40:26,008 --> 02:40:28,551
[SPEAKER_20]: Yours just hates you because I have Windows XP and mine works fine.

2095
02:40:28,852 --> 02:40:29,572
[SPEAKER_20]: Here's what I do, though.

2096
02:40:29,632 --> 02:40:31,715
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't use the stupid program that it comes with.

2097
02:40:31,775 --> 02:40:35,139
[SPEAKER_20]: I use a program called... Fuck, I can't remember the name.

2098
02:40:38,246 --> 02:40:43,468
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, I use a program called... Called... My screensaver's on and now my computer isn't responding.

2099
02:40:43,708 --> 02:40:44,208
[SPEAKER_20]: Hold on.

2100
02:40:44,708 --> 02:40:48,970
[SPEAKER_20]: It's called... PSX Game Edit.

2101
02:40:49,830 --> 02:40:51,331
[SPEAKER_20]: Or, yeah, Game Edit.

2102
02:40:51,371 --> 02:40:52,631
[SPEAKER_20]: PSX Game Edit.

2103
02:40:52,731 --> 02:40:56,293
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's a nice little program that you can use for copying your edits and stuff.

2104
02:40:56,313 --> 02:40:56,793
[SPEAKER_20]: It works fine.

2105
02:40:56,933 --> 02:41:00,054
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, trust me, this thing works on my freaking laptop.

2106
02:41:00,134 --> 02:41:00,874
[SPEAKER_20]: It sucks ass.

2107
02:41:00,934 --> 02:41:02,275
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, it'll work on anything.

2108
02:41:02,984 --> 02:41:08,006
[SPEAKER_15]: If it doesn't work on XP, do not use XP drivers that XP tells you will work.

2109
02:41:08,426 --> 02:41:10,486
[SPEAKER_15]: Go to their website and download a driver off their site.

2110
02:41:10,526 --> 02:41:11,667
[SPEAKER_15]: That might be the problem as well.

2111
02:41:14,448 --> 02:41:15,168
[SPEAKER_21]: You have a question?

2112
02:41:15,668 --> 02:41:17,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you can get through everyone else's question.

2113
02:41:17,168 --> 02:41:17,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, go ahead.

2114
02:41:17,749 --> 02:41:18,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Why not?

2115
02:41:18,129 --> 02:41:19,109
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get to theirs eventually.

2116
02:41:19,309 --> 02:41:22,730
[SPEAKER_07]: My question is for you or Matt or Jamie, who's not here.

2117
02:41:23,030 --> 02:41:23,310
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2118
02:41:23,390 --> 02:41:28,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you guys ever going to do the Covers in Classics show and or a request show?

2119
02:41:28,843 --> 02:41:30,444
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2120
02:41:52,601 --> 02:41:54,682
[SPEAKER_21]: So what we do is we have season three.

2121
02:41:55,183 --> 02:41:57,964
[SPEAKER_21]: One other thing I wanted to do on top of that is add some more music programming.

2122
02:41:58,024 --> 02:42:03,827
[SPEAKER_21]: We have the long version lunches and late nights that are coming soon to the station, which have been coming soon for like three months.

2123
02:42:03,867 --> 02:42:09,770
[SPEAKER_21]: But anyway, some other things I'd like to do is maybe have like a cover show, like a classic show, like an 80s.

2124
02:42:10,110 --> 02:42:16,574
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, the thing is that I don't want to compete with anything that Under Station Live does because they're kind of the birthplace of this.

2125
02:42:16,614 --> 02:42:18,655
[SPEAKER_21]: And they have an 80s show now on understationlive.org.

2126
02:42:19,435 --> 02:42:21,937
[SPEAKER_21]: So it would be more of a classic show.

2127
02:42:22,597 --> 02:42:24,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Not just 80s, but early 90s dance stuff.

2128
02:42:24,958 --> 02:42:26,239
[SPEAKER_07]: And more dance songs.

2129
02:42:26,339 --> 02:42:27,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Not gothy songs.

2130
02:42:27,560 --> 02:42:30,041
[SPEAKER_07]: The songs that they covered in DDR.

2131
02:42:30,061 --> 02:42:32,002
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have to be strictly 80s.

2132
02:42:32,302 --> 02:42:34,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Or like a request show, like I said.

2133
02:42:34,504 --> 02:42:35,624
[SPEAKER_21]: I would like to see that happen.

2134
02:42:35,664 --> 02:42:40,427
[SPEAKER_21]: And of course, the request shows are kind of already happening because we do have the live fuck-offs that go on on the station.

2135
02:42:40,747 --> 02:42:41,488
[SPEAKER_21]: But they're not scheduled.

2136
02:42:41,508 --> 02:42:42,068
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the only problem.

2137
02:42:42,208 --> 02:42:45,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, like an actual 6.30 to 9.30 Sunday request.

2138
02:42:45,470 --> 02:42:47,611
[SPEAKER_21]: It's possible, but it just depends.

2139
02:42:47,631 --> 02:43:02,020
[SPEAKER_21]: The problem is, Loki, myself, DarkSakura, we dedicate a lot of time to the station as it is, and I think while we're willing to dedicate more, certainly it's kind of hard for us to sit there and go like, okay, I'm going to do it Tuesday at 6, you know, it's kind of hard to take away.

2140
02:43:02,040 --> 02:43:07,563
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like an actual, on a Sunday, you know, like an actual official show for a request as opposed to a fuck-off.

2141
02:43:07,583 --> 02:43:08,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Possibly, possibly.

2142
02:43:08,343 --> 02:43:09,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't you have an intern?

2143
02:43:09,984 --> 02:43:11,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we do have an intern.

2144
02:43:11,185 --> 02:43:12,646
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, and certainly he can.

2145
02:43:13,627 --> 02:43:15,749
[SPEAKER_21]: And we have other people that want to go live on our station too.

2146
02:43:15,769 --> 02:43:22,293
[SPEAKER_21]: We just have to figure out how to work all that out fairly without taking away from the rest of Orange Lounge.

2147
02:43:22,954 --> 02:43:26,096
[SPEAKER_21]: Not turning it into an egothon, I guess I should say.

2148
02:43:26,397 --> 02:43:30,880
[SPEAKER_21]: Because then everybody, if one person, we let one audience member go live, then everybody's going to want to go live.

2149
02:43:30,900 --> 02:43:37,365
[SPEAKER_21]: So we have to find a way to figure out how to do it fair while it still holds the high quality of Orange Lounge Radio and all that stuff.

2150
02:43:37,465 --> 02:43:38,446
[SPEAKER_21]: So we'll figure it out.

2151
02:43:38,866 --> 02:43:42,030
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just talking to Anita and I reminded myself of another fuck you I have to have, alright?

2152
02:43:42,350 --> 02:43:43,251
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, go for it.

2153
02:43:43,271 --> 02:43:45,254
[SPEAKER_15]: This is fuck you to my parents, alright?

2154
02:43:46,395 --> 02:43:47,576
[SPEAKER_15]: And my family for that matter.

2155
02:43:47,957 --> 02:43:51,020
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I've only known Anita for like three weeks.

2156
02:43:51,100 --> 02:43:53,403
[SPEAKER_15]: Stop asking me, is she marriage material?

2157
02:43:53,623 --> 02:43:54,624
[SPEAKER_15]: Is she going to have kids?

2158
02:43:54,644 --> 02:43:55,646
[SPEAKER_15]: Does she want to have kids?

2159
02:43:56,567 --> 02:43:57,928
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are good birthing hints.

2160
02:44:00,663 --> 02:44:01,343
[SPEAKER_20]: That's another thing.

2161
02:44:01,403 --> 02:44:04,545
[SPEAKER_20]: My ex keeps emailing me, and she keeps asking me the same question.

2162
02:44:04,565 --> 02:44:05,665
[SPEAKER_20]: I said, are you going to marry Nellie?

2163
02:44:05,685 --> 02:44:06,466
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you going to marry her?

2164
02:44:07,246 --> 02:44:13,789
[SPEAKER_20]: Just because you broke up with me and got married, like, a couple weeks later, doesn't mean that I'm going to go out and get married right away.

2165
02:44:13,869 --> 02:44:26,035
[SPEAKER_20]: Just because you're a freaking Jesus freak, okay, and have to be, like, have some commitment issues, and are living in Chico, you know, and your potential is a pet, what was it?

2166
02:44:26,095 --> 02:44:27,896
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a veterinarian secretary.

2167
02:44:29,837 --> 02:44:29,997
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

2168
02:44:31,758 --> 02:44:37,002
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so that fuck you is for you mom and Eugene and you Aunt Mickey and you Uncle Zach.

2169
02:44:37,243 --> 02:44:37,903
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck all of you.

2170
02:44:38,103 --> 02:44:41,206
[SPEAKER_21]: Happy Mother's Day from Orange Lounge Radio.

2171
02:44:43,108 --> 02:44:43,748
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, moving on.

2172
02:44:44,128 --> 02:44:44,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you had another question, Irene?

2173
02:44:44,989 --> 02:44:45,129
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2174
02:44:45,450 --> 02:44:45,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2175
02:44:45,810 --> 02:44:46,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just taking the mic.

2176
02:44:47,571 --> 02:44:48,832
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's move on then, shall we?

2177
02:44:49,213 --> 02:44:49,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2178
02:44:54,207 --> 02:45:02,730
[SPEAKER_21]: Next question is, Dark Tetsuya would like to know, will you ever get around to adding more Vanessa May, speaking of which?

2179
02:45:03,990 --> 02:45:10,553
[SPEAKER_21]: The only problem with adding more Vanessa May is that she hasn't really done anything else, Dance Mania, things like that.

2180
02:45:12,294 --> 02:45:16,718
[SPEAKER_21]: Except for a really, really horrible track of Vanessa May, which I think appears on Dance Mania 7.

2181
02:45:17,299 --> 02:45:23,806
[SPEAKER_21]: But even Dark Tetsuya, the complete Vanessa May whore agrees, that song is of the suck, and it will never be played again on Orange Ones Radio.

2182
02:45:25,868 --> 02:45:30,673
[SPEAKER_21]: But we do have some random stuff that appears, so I don't see why we can't add one or two more Vanessa May songs, just because she rocks.

2183
02:45:31,275 --> 02:45:38,796
[SPEAKER_21]: But I've got to find something more techno-y, upbeat, that fits into the groove of the rest of the station.

2184
02:45:39,456 --> 02:45:43,897
[SPEAKER_21]: Something like, there's a song called White Bird that's remixed by Airscape, that's pretty good.

2185
02:45:44,197 --> 02:45:45,978
[SPEAKER_21]: And Airscape is actually Bomani related too.

2186
02:45:46,798 --> 02:45:48,158
[SPEAKER_21]: White Bird's pretty good, so I might add that.

2187
02:45:48,918 --> 02:45:50,778
[SPEAKER_21]: But as far as like, it's got to be something dance-y.

2188
02:45:50,798 --> 02:45:53,919
[SPEAKER_21]: If you have some dance-y Vanessa May songs, certainly send them, we'll think about adding them.

2189
02:45:54,919 --> 02:45:59,440
[SPEAKER_21]: But there is some good, and she does have that Cotton Eye Joe, and that does relate to Bomani in a roundabout way, so...

2190
02:46:00,385 --> 02:46:06,631
[SPEAKER_21]: But for the time being, I think it's just going to be a fuck-offs, and then we'll try to get at least one more Vanessa May track.

2191
02:46:06,651 --> 02:46:09,033
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I know Fantasia's getting a little stale, but you know what you need to do?

2192
02:46:09,253 --> 02:46:13,157
[SPEAKER_21]: You need to write Vanessa May and tell her to let herself appear on more Tanzania albums.

2193
02:46:13,437 --> 02:46:17,101
[SPEAKER_19]: Or you could just say, oh wait, Vanessa May sucks, and I don't really give a shit about her.

2194
02:46:17,261 --> 02:46:17,921
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, shut up.

2195
02:46:18,622 --> 02:46:21,144
[SPEAKER_15]: Or you could write her and tell her to stop making crap music.

2196
02:46:21,905 --> 02:46:22,786
[SPEAKER_21]: You guys are awful.

2197
02:46:23,226 --> 02:46:24,347
[SPEAKER_19]: Vanessa May's a piece of shit.

2198
02:46:24,427 --> 02:46:25,108
[SPEAKER_21]: And guess what?

2199
02:46:25,208 --> 02:46:25,789
[SPEAKER_21]: We just...

2200
02:46:26,770 --> 02:46:27,811
[SPEAKER_21]: We just net split.

2201
02:46:28,051 --> 02:46:29,852
[SPEAKER_21]: Our chat rooms are going through a net split right now.

2202
02:46:30,373 --> 02:46:36,077
[SPEAKER_21]: So if you're on the other side of the net split, you guys can email your questions right now too.

2203
02:46:36,137 --> 02:46:37,778
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll keep an eye on the email box, okay?

2204
02:46:38,339 --> 02:46:43,523
[SPEAKER_21]: Email your questions to orangeloungeradio, that's all one word, orangeloungeradio at yahoo.com.

2205
02:46:43,783 --> 02:46:51,208
[SPEAKER_21]: A net split is when the servers, one of the servers, like a chat room has like 10 different servers all funneling into the chat room.

2206
02:46:51,549 --> 02:46:53,210
[SPEAKER_21]: That's when like half those servers break off.

2207
02:46:53,670 --> 02:46:55,270
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, they stopped talking to each other.

2208
02:46:55,310 --> 02:46:55,630
[SPEAKER_19]: They crashed.

2209
02:46:55,650 --> 02:46:56,631
[SPEAKER_19]: Even one server can break off.

2210
02:46:56,691 --> 02:46:56,791
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

2211
02:46:56,811 --> 02:46:58,291
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the link between a bunch of the servers.

2212
02:46:58,311 --> 02:46:58,671
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.

2213
02:46:58,931 --> 02:47:03,232
[SPEAKER_19]: And that causes a bunch of the other people to suddenly look like they quit, but they didn't quit.

2214
02:47:03,352 --> 02:47:05,252
[SPEAKER_19]: They're still online, but they're on some other server.

2215
02:47:05,272 --> 02:47:06,912
[SPEAKER_19]: So you lost the link between a bunch of those people.

2216
02:47:07,352 --> 02:47:11,093
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm sure people who are listening right now understand that already, but this is for people who didn't understand.

2217
02:47:11,393 --> 02:47:11,833
[SPEAKER_19]: You never know.

2218
02:47:12,253 --> 02:47:13,013
[SPEAKER_19]: In the... You never know.

2219
02:47:13,353 --> 02:47:16,154
[SPEAKER_21]: We have some people who are new to our chatroom who may not understand the Nesplay.

2220
02:47:16,174 --> 02:47:17,454
[SPEAKER_21]: We get new people on our chatroom every week.

2221
02:47:17,474 --> 02:47:17,934
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello to you.

2222
02:47:18,194 --> 02:47:22,795
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you want to join our chatroom, just head on over to Calibamonte.com, click on Orange Lounge, and click on Chat.

2223
02:47:24,346 --> 02:47:25,729
[SPEAKER_15]: That was a very nice segue Rob.

2224
02:47:25,749 --> 02:47:26,069
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2225
02:47:39,082 --> 02:47:44,586
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, anyways, my site, a couple things are going to happen.

2226
02:47:44,686 --> 02:47:46,667
[SPEAKER_20]: First off, I need to actually do an update.

2227
02:47:49,029 --> 02:47:57,234
[SPEAKER_20]: I also noticed that there's a few files missing on there that need to be on there because I was going through my stuff and there's a few things I forgot to move over in the appropriate folders and zip up and whatnot.

2228
02:47:57,594 --> 02:48:01,197
[SPEAKER_20]: But anyways, another thing that's coming to my site is forums.

2229
02:48:01,677 --> 02:48:05,079
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I actually purchased forums and I will have forums soon.

2230
02:48:05,199 --> 02:48:07,801
[SPEAKER_20]: I just have to scan them and then we're ready to go.

2231
02:48:08,041 --> 02:48:09,202
[SPEAKER_21]: Has to give him some clothes.

2232
02:48:09,862 --> 02:48:10,103
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2233
02:48:10,503 --> 02:48:10,783
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

2234
02:48:12,845 --> 02:48:17,828
[SPEAKER_21]: Good question coming to us from AkumaGM, who is getting us to talk about some Bomani.

2235
02:48:18,849 --> 02:48:23,772
[SPEAKER_21]: Will the release of DDRXbox produce some enjoyable, downloadable content?

2236
02:48:24,853 --> 02:48:25,714
[SPEAKER_21]: Interesting question.

2237
02:48:25,914 --> 02:48:26,715
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki says yes.

2238
02:48:27,595 --> 02:48:29,457
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't know there was going to be a DDRXbox.

2239
02:48:29,477 --> 02:48:31,298
[SPEAKER_21]: You need to listen to this show more often, Brad.

2240
02:48:31,398 --> 02:48:31,858
[SPEAKER_19]: Fuck you.

2241
02:48:31,938 --> 02:48:32,499
[SPEAKER_19]: What is this show?

2242
02:48:33,857 --> 02:48:34,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Content, yes.

2243
02:48:34,718 --> 02:48:35,358
[SPEAKER_15]: Enjoyable, no.

2244
02:48:35,518 --> 02:48:37,019
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, fuck you, Xbox.

2245
02:48:37,299 --> 02:48:40,341
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck you, listener or chat person for mentioning the Xbox.

2246
02:48:40,741 --> 02:48:41,762
[SPEAKER_15]: Xbox sucks.

2247
02:48:42,262 --> 02:48:52,648
[SPEAKER_15]: The only game you should ever buy on Xbox other than Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball just for the jiggliness or Outlaw Volleyball for the jiggliness is Psychonauts because my friend is making that game and it's going to be badass.

2248
02:48:52,668 --> 02:48:54,329
[SPEAKER_15]: But other than that, Xbox sucks.

2249
02:48:54,490 --> 02:48:58,472
[SPEAKER_15]: It makes a better Linux machine and they finally hacked it with Linux without putting a mod chip in.

2250
02:48:59,662 --> 02:49:02,926
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, before we continue, because I'm going to play the devil's advocate here.

2251
02:49:03,207 --> 02:49:05,149
[SPEAKER_19]: We all know the console war will never end.

2252
02:49:05,529 --> 02:49:10,456
[SPEAKER_19]: I personally don't hate, or I personally don't like Xbox, but I don't want to piss off a bunch of people by saying that.

2253
02:49:11,036 --> 02:49:18,566
[SPEAKER_20]: They did this Xbox propaganda thing on G4 this morning, talking about how it's so great and everything, and how it's... No.

2254
02:49:20,575 --> 02:49:24,359
[SPEAKER_21]: To quote Ryan, Xbox would be better served as a weapon to hit 10 year old children with.

2255
02:49:40,010 --> 02:49:40,410
[SPEAKER_19]: DirectX Box

2256
02:49:58,519 --> 02:49:58,960
[SPEAKER_19]: Konami.

2257
02:49:59,200 --> 02:50:00,421
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's all write letters to Konami.

2258
02:50:00,862 --> 02:50:09,672
[SPEAKER_19]: Instead of wasting your production time to make stupid Xbox ports of Bomani games, why don't you put your time into making 7th style for home PS2?

2259
02:50:09,812 --> 02:50:12,375
[SPEAKER_19]: So we can have 2DX at home again.

2260
02:50:13,637 --> 02:50:16,600
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I don't care if it's US or Japanese, I want more 2DX at home.

2261
02:50:16,620 --> 02:50:18,523
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, this is the problem.

2262
02:50:19,306 --> 02:50:19,906
[SPEAKER_21]: This is the problem.

2263
02:50:20,646 --> 02:50:24,307
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, DDR Xbox will have enjoyable, downloadable content.

2264
02:50:24,467 --> 02:50:29,148
[SPEAKER_21]: And in fact, I predict DDR Xbox is going to be the best fucking DDR game they've done yet.

2265
02:50:29,448 --> 02:50:30,028
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you know why?

2266
02:50:30,408 --> 02:50:33,289
[SPEAKER_21]: Because we're all sitting here bitching about how we're not going to buy it and support the Xbox.

2267
02:50:33,609 --> 02:50:34,989
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's the way God works.

2268
02:50:35,850 --> 02:50:38,470
[SPEAKER_15]: It will probably have enjoyable, downloadable content.

2269
02:50:38,990 --> 02:50:43,331
[SPEAKER_15]: At the price of $50 a month in addition to your normal cost of the game for Xbox Live.

2270
02:50:45,072 --> 02:50:46,092
[SPEAKER_15]: Xbox Live is $50 a month?

2271
02:50:51,888 --> 02:50:54,730
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, it's going to cost me $15 a month to play EverQuest 2.

2272
02:50:54,790 --> 02:50:57,251
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not going to pay $50 for Xbox Live.

2273
02:50:58,072 --> 02:51:00,013
[SPEAKER_20]: All we're going to do is make the DWIs in a few days.

2274
02:51:00,393 --> 02:51:07,097
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, speaking of which, unless someone beats me to it, I'm making the DWIs for the Max to Exclusive songs.

2275
02:51:07,977 --> 02:51:09,518
[SPEAKER_20]: Those will be coming out probably pretty soon.

2276
02:51:10,098 --> 02:51:12,060
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm really shocked those haven't already been done.

2277
02:51:12,400 --> 02:51:15,361
[SPEAKER_20]: People have just been lazy, actually, and haven't gotten their game or just don't care.

2278
02:51:15,481 --> 02:51:16,342
[SPEAKER_20]: I can make mine, like...

2279
02:51:17,743 --> 02:51:19,985
[SPEAKER_20]: I can make them the night if I wanted to.

2280
02:51:20,005 --> 02:51:22,487
[SPEAKER_20]: The question is do I want to.

2281
02:51:24,443 --> 02:51:29,326
[SPEAKER_21]: The next question is from SoCalKicks, and I accidentally closed his window, but I sort of remember what it said.

2282
02:51:29,346 --> 02:51:31,047
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I remember that guy, a long time ago.

2283
02:51:31,067 --> 02:51:34,549
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I know, he has disappeared, but he actually asked a question.

2284
02:51:34,890 --> 02:51:39,252
[SPEAKER_21]: For those who may not remember SoCalKicks, let me play a little something.

2285
02:51:39,272 --> 02:51:43,555
[SPEAKER_20]: Bastion has a bigger mall than we do, and it's cooler, and they have a Dave and Buster's there.

2286
02:51:44,235 --> 02:51:46,196
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, we met SoCalKicks some time ago.

2287
02:51:46,257 --> 02:51:49,238
[SPEAKER_20]: They have a guy that gives massages in the mall, and it was, ah, so good.

2288
02:51:50,499 --> 02:51:53,381
[SPEAKER_21]: For those of you that forget SoCalKicks, here's a little reminder.

2289
02:51:57,213 --> 02:51:58,633
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody, this is DSDS.

2290
02:51:58,673 --> 02:52:02,474
[SPEAKER_16]: Make sure to visit SoCalKicks.com and you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2291
02:52:02,694 --> 02:52:05,674
[SPEAKER_16]: We finally accomplished ultimate evolution just now.

2292
02:52:06,655 --> 02:52:10,295
[SPEAKER_21]: You know how many times I had to get him to say his own little motto for his website?

2293
02:52:11,135 --> 02:52:11,395
[SPEAKER_21]: Twice.

2294
02:52:11,555 --> 02:52:18,997
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, he wants to know, why is it that I'm not listening to this station anymore, even though I have an urge to?

2295
02:52:23,197 --> 02:52:25,278
[SPEAKER_15]: Because SoCalKicks, you suck.

2296
02:52:28,246 --> 02:52:28,866
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know about that.

2297
02:52:28,926 --> 02:52:29,787
[SPEAKER_19]: He seemed like a pretty cool guy.

2298
02:52:29,947 --> 02:52:32,768
[SPEAKER_21]: I say he's just discovered the joys of masturbation.

2299
02:52:33,508 --> 02:52:36,789
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, spending a lot more time with Rosie Palmer and her five sisters?

2300
02:52:36,989 --> 02:52:38,510
[SPEAKER_21]: I hope the window's not open still, is it?

2301
02:52:38,650 --> 02:52:42,432
[SPEAKER_20]: That is no excuse whatsoever if you're listening to the radio.

2302
02:52:42,832 --> 02:52:45,793
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, that requires no hands at all.

2303
02:52:46,821 --> 02:52:55,703
[SPEAKER_15]: Even if you're one-handed, you one-hand it to live365.com, you one-hand click Orange Lounge, one-click the play, and then your hand's free.

2304
02:52:56,163 --> 02:52:59,204
[SPEAKER_15]: But you can even put Flash videos up and watch those at the same time.

2305
02:52:59,944 --> 02:53:01,965
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we got a new sweeper here with Dark Child.

2306
02:53:02,565 --> 02:53:03,385
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on, man.

2307
02:53:04,205 --> 02:53:07,766
[SPEAKER_20]: Shit, man, you could probably play Step Mania and beat off at the same time.

2308
02:53:10,051 --> 02:53:11,212
[SPEAKER_15]: It seems possible.

2309
02:53:11,732 --> 02:53:14,094
[SPEAKER_15]: You could probably beat off and play 5-key Beatmania too.

2310
02:53:14,114 --> 02:53:15,775
[SPEAKER_15]: 7-key is a little hard.

2311
02:53:15,815 --> 02:53:19,897
[SPEAKER_19]: He's playing 5-key Beatmania with his penis.

2312
02:53:20,057 --> 02:53:23,860
[SPEAKER_19]: That was playing one-handed.

2313
02:53:24,960 --> 02:53:28,402
[SPEAKER_19]: That song you played, the DWI, was like, how long?

2314
02:53:28,422 --> 02:53:29,223
[SPEAKER_19]: 45 minutes?

2315
02:53:30,443 --> 02:53:32,825
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that made your hand more tired than masturbating, I'm sure.

2316
02:53:34,986 --> 02:53:36,407
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a workout for my right hand.

2317
02:53:37,580 --> 02:53:49,784
[SPEAKER_19]: I did also perfect combo the beauty of silence one-handed, so... The beauty of... I full comboed the skin flute one-handed.

2318
02:53:51,204 --> 02:53:52,345
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, flute man, I mean.

2319
02:53:52,485 --> 02:53:53,025
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the song.

2320
02:53:54,286 --> 02:53:55,366
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, moving right along.

2321
02:53:55,866 --> 02:54:00,428
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm waiting to get yelled at for that answer, but since he's not listening, he won't hear it unless somebody communicates it to him.

2322
02:54:00,748 --> 02:54:05,869
[SPEAKER_21]: And right now he's probably getting 20 messages from tattletales going, They're teasing you about masturbation!

2323
02:54:06,749 --> 02:54:08,109
[SPEAKER_19]: Where's he from again?

2324
02:54:08,129 --> 02:54:08,970
[SPEAKER_19]: He's from Fremont?

2325
02:54:09,490 --> 02:54:11,090
[SPEAKER_21]: Hence the name SoCalKicks.

2326
02:54:11,750 --> 02:54:13,691
[SPEAKER_21]: SoCalKicks means he's from, you know, Hawaii.

2327
02:54:13,731 --> 02:54:16,472
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought he was in, like, Amsterdam or something, you dumbass.

2328
02:54:17,032 --> 02:54:18,772
[SPEAKER_15]: Is he part of, like, Team Change-O-Land?

2329
02:54:18,792 --> 02:54:21,933
[SPEAKER_15]: Because, I mean, they could teach him how to masturbate properly while he sits on the radio.

2330
02:54:24,264 --> 02:54:26,445
[SPEAKER_21]: In fact, don't they have a radio show there?

2331
02:54:27,365 --> 02:54:27,765
[SPEAKER_21]: Who knows?

2332
02:54:27,865 --> 02:54:28,526
[SPEAKER_21]: Nobody listens.

2333
02:54:29,906 --> 02:54:30,266
[SPEAKER_21]: That's okay.

2334
02:54:30,286 --> 02:54:31,166
[SPEAKER_21]: Nobody listens to this either.

2335
02:54:31,787 --> 02:54:32,467
[SPEAKER_19]: More than them.

2336
02:54:32,827 --> 02:54:34,027
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, anyway.

2337
02:54:34,528 --> 02:54:35,068
[SPEAKER_21]: Be nice.

2338
02:54:35,748 --> 02:54:36,328
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I'll be nice.

2339
02:54:38,449 --> 02:54:39,309
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, new question.

2340
02:54:39,329 --> 02:54:39,769
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, listen.

2341
02:54:40,209 --> 02:54:40,649
[SPEAKER_21]: New question.

2342
02:54:40,669 --> 02:54:41,570
[SPEAKER_21]: Here we go.

2343
02:54:41,630 --> 02:54:47,132
[SPEAKER_21]: John Fields wants to know, psychology or ethnic conflicts of the 20th century?

2344
02:54:47,932 --> 02:54:48,952
[SPEAKER_21]: Which category for Jeopardy?

2345
02:54:49,012 --> 02:54:49,152
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

2346
02:54:49,412 --> 02:54:51,433
[SPEAKER_21]: He wants to know, which essay should I start next?

2347
02:54:53,248 --> 02:54:57,811
[SPEAKER_21]: Psychology or... Ethnic conflicts of the 20th century.

2348
02:54:59,552 --> 02:55:01,853
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I say, I mean, these people are yelling psychology.

2349
02:55:02,153 --> 02:55:10,538
[SPEAKER_15]: Do the ethnic whatever, because you're going to rack your brain on that shit, and then you could actually use some of the dilemmas you'll have in your psychology paper.

2350
02:55:10,978 --> 02:55:11,359
[SPEAKER_21]: I agree.

2351
02:55:11,399 --> 02:55:16,802
[SPEAKER_21]: I think since psychology sounds like the easier one, do that second, so that you coast down through the second paper.

2352
02:55:16,882 --> 02:55:20,084
[SPEAKER_19]: I say plagiarize a Dr. Phil episode, and there you go.

2353
02:55:22,159 --> 02:55:25,782
[SPEAKER_18]: I say do the psychology if you're going to put all that work into it, at least learn how to fuck with people's heads.

2354
02:55:25,802 --> 02:55:28,864
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait a minute, what were the two topics again?

2355
02:55:29,344 --> 02:55:32,747
[SPEAKER_21]: Psychology or ethnic conflicts of the 20th century.

2356
02:55:32,967 --> 02:55:39,291
[SPEAKER_15]: Why not do a psychology paper about the ethnic conflicts of the 20th century and then print it out twice and turn it into both classes?

2357
02:55:39,732 --> 02:55:40,912
[SPEAKER_21]: Beautiful, there you go.

2358
02:55:40,992 --> 02:55:41,753
[SPEAKER_21]: There's your answer.

2359
02:55:43,814 --> 02:55:44,895
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

2360
02:55:46,757 --> 02:55:49,939
[SPEAKER_21]: DDR Angel has a question for Loki.

2361
02:55:51,286 --> 02:55:53,147
[SPEAKER_21]: This is a question for Loki from DDR Angel.

2362
02:55:53,808 --> 02:55:54,528
[SPEAKER_21]: Will you marry me?

2363
02:55:54,588 --> 02:55:55,128
[SPEAKER_21]: No, just kidding.

2364
02:55:57,010 --> 02:55:59,471
[SPEAKER_21]: That question's reserved for someone else in our chat room.

2365
02:55:59,511 --> 02:56:00,472
[SPEAKER_21]: We won't talk about that.

2366
02:56:00,592 --> 02:56:01,112
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just kidding.

2367
02:56:01,172 --> 02:56:02,293
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh God, I'm so going to get smacked.

2368
02:56:02,913 --> 02:56:07,656
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm like just waiting for the buffer to get there.

2369
02:56:08,617 --> 02:56:08,957
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

2370
02:56:10,257 --> 02:56:11,658
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

2371
02:56:12,179 --> 02:56:12,499
[SPEAKER_21]: Never mind.

2372
02:56:12,539 --> 02:56:13,740
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway, here's the real question.

2373
02:56:15,080 --> 02:56:16,101
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, there, I just got smacked.

2374
02:56:17,042 --> 02:56:17,302
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

2375
02:56:18,403 --> 02:56:20,305
[SPEAKER_21]: When are you going to get to do a fuck-off?

2376
02:56:20,405 --> 02:56:22,166
[SPEAKER_21]: We need your mix, Mastinus.

2377
02:56:22,886 --> 02:56:23,727
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, let's see here.

2378
02:56:23,787 --> 02:56:26,789
[SPEAKER_20]: First off, I need to get broadband hooked up to my computer.

2379
02:56:27,029 --> 02:56:30,292
[SPEAKER_20]: Since it doesn't seem to be happening at the moment, it's not for a while.

2380
02:56:30,312 --> 02:56:31,292
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

2381
02:56:32,834 --> 02:56:33,034
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

2382
02:56:33,294 --> 02:56:33,814
[SPEAKER_21]: Eventually.

2383
02:56:34,195 --> 02:56:38,738
[SPEAKER_21]: It is something that will be coming to... In fact, we're hoping... This goes back to Irene's question earlier.

2384
02:56:39,719 --> 02:56:41,520
[SPEAKER_21]: Hopefully, Loki will be...

2385
02:56:42,290 --> 02:56:45,254
[SPEAKER_21]: Doing a regular show, like it'll be like every week at a certain time, right?

2386
02:56:45,354 --> 02:56:48,859
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, there was going to be a mixed show, but you know, there's kind of a couple problems with that.

2387
02:56:48,939 --> 02:56:50,581
[SPEAKER_20]: First off, I don't know how to mix.

2388
02:56:54,226 --> 02:56:56,048
[SPEAKER_20]: So we need to kind of figure that one out first.

2389
02:56:56,989 --> 02:57:00,654
[SPEAKER_15]: I can almost match, maybe you could fix that almost part and then you could do it.

2390
02:57:02,561 --> 02:57:03,002
[SPEAKER_20]: I can do it.

2391
02:57:03,022 --> 02:57:08,427
[SPEAKER_20]: I honestly have to go through all my records and mark down what the BPM is on in all of them.

2392
02:57:09,608 --> 02:57:13,332
[SPEAKER_20]: And then I have to listen to all of them numerous times, which is going to be a bitch.

2393
02:57:13,992 --> 02:57:19,678
[SPEAKER_20]: So I know what songs sound the same, beat-wise and bass-wise, so I can mix them together.

2394
02:57:23,516 --> 02:57:26,177
[SPEAKER_15]: And you already know about, like, filter out to just the bass.

2395
02:57:26,197 --> 02:57:31,038
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to get through these last couple questions before we have to end the show here.

2396
02:57:32,358 --> 02:57:33,919
[SPEAKER_21]: Ah, return of a classic.

2397
02:57:33,979 --> 02:57:35,099
[SPEAKER_21]: This question's for Bradley.

2398
02:57:35,379 --> 02:57:35,739
[SPEAKER_21]: Penis.

2399
02:57:36,279 --> 02:57:46,842
[SPEAKER_21]: And this question's been asked to a lot of people on the show, but 23rd Magus wants to know, Bradley, what would you do with two quiet Jap girls, a bucket of Choco Ready Whip, a cake pie, and a 2DX controller?

2400
02:57:50,390 --> 02:57:51,711
[SPEAKER_18]: Our child wants to answer this too.

2401
02:57:52,212 --> 02:57:55,774
[SPEAKER_18]: I probably go crazy and just not know what to do.

2402
02:57:55,834 --> 02:57:58,397
[SPEAKER_18]: I just kind of sit in the corner and watch them play 2DX.

2403
02:58:00,578 --> 02:58:01,659
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, dude.

2404
02:58:01,699 --> 02:58:04,762
[SPEAKER_18]: And film the whole thing and tell them to do crazy stuff.

2405
02:58:04,982 --> 02:58:05,923
[SPEAKER_15]: It was Chocolate Ready Whip?

2406
02:58:06,823 --> 02:58:08,645
[SPEAKER_15]: I play Beat Mania while eating Chocolate Ready Whip.

2407
02:58:09,625 --> 02:58:10,226
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a good thing to do.

2408
02:58:10,466 --> 02:58:11,367
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, you got it.

2409
02:58:19,474 --> 02:58:21,556
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no, I play Beat Mania.

2410
02:58:23,297 --> 02:58:23,637
[SPEAKER_15]: I get it.

2411
02:58:27,140 --> 02:58:33,044
[SPEAKER_20]: First, I'd accept the video camera, because obviously any situation with that, there would have to be a video camera in the room.

2412
02:58:33,064 --> 02:58:34,606
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'd link to the website with it broadcasting on.

2413
02:58:34,626 --> 02:58:35,186
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, definitely.

2414
02:58:35,486 --> 02:58:36,187
[SPEAKER_20]: Inner broadcast.

2415
02:58:37,428 --> 02:58:38,148
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see here.

2416
02:58:38,168 --> 02:58:39,669
[SPEAKER_20]: Kawaii Japanese Girls.

2417
02:58:40,010 --> 02:58:40,910
[SPEAKER_20]: So impressionable.

2418
02:58:41,171 --> 02:58:41,951
[SPEAKER_20]: And with Ready Whip.

2419
02:58:42,211 --> 02:58:43,252
[SPEAKER_15]: Are they in schoolgirl uniforms?

2420
02:58:43,733 --> 02:58:46,635
[SPEAKER_20]: No, see, they have to be regular Ready Whip, because I don't like chocolate that much.

2421
02:58:46,655 --> 02:58:47,856
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a question for Bradley, guys.

2422
02:58:47,896 --> 02:58:48,196
[SPEAKER_19]: Come on.

2423
02:58:49,042 --> 02:58:55,305
[SPEAKER_18]: This brings up a fuck you to people who use some Japanese words in English, like kawaii girls.

2424
02:58:55,805 --> 02:58:57,386
[SPEAKER_18]: That's really, really fucking annoying.

2425
02:58:57,906 --> 02:59:05,210
[SPEAKER_18]: Especially in this, I get Raijin Magazine, and they have a game and anime thing, and then they bring it out of somewhere out of nowhere.

2426
02:59:05,490 --> 02:59:06,730
[SPEAKER_18]: This game is really kawaii.

2427
02:59:06,750 --> 02:59:07,871
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what I hate?

2428
02:59:07,891 --> 02:59:16,015
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what I hate is when people mispronounce anime and spell it wrong when they email me at work asking me questions about anime.

2429
02:59:16,115 --> 02:59:17,295
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to know about the anima.

2430
02:59:17,655 --> 02:59:18,516
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to know about the...

2431
02:59:20,437 --> 02:59:21,097
[SPEAKER_20]: The enemy.

2432
02:59:21,417 --> 02:59:27,160
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to know about the Japan... I can't even pronounce how they say it.

2433
02:59:27,260 --> 02:59:29,160
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like the Japanimation.

2434
02:59:29,601 --> 02:59:30,301
[SPEAKER_15]: Just write them back.

2435
02:59:30,341 --> 02:59:32,382
[SPEAKER_15]: The enema is up your ass and you are the enemy.

2436
02:59:35,503 --> 02:59:36,503
[SPEAKER_21]: Japaninamco nation?

2437
02:59:36,523 --> 02:59:36,844
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

2438
02:59:36,964 --> 02:59:37,184
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyway.

2439
02:59:37,944 --> 02:59:39,325
[SPEAKER_20]: They're like Japanime.

2440
02:59:39,465 --> 02:59:40,325
[SPEAKER_21]: Japanime.

2441
02:59:41,486 --> 02:59:42,026
[SPEAKER_21]: Japanime.

2442
02:59:43,306 --> 02:59:44,327
[SPEAKER_21]: I like that, Japanime.

2443
02:59:44,927 --> 02:59:46,488
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, here we go.

2444
02:59:46,968 --> 02:59:49,669
[SPEAKER_21]: Dartetsuyu would like to know, have you ever played Parodius?

2445
02:59:50,549 --> 02:59:52,070
[SPEAKER_21]: Gogucho, Sexy, etc.

2446
02:59:52,730 --> 02:59:53,411
[SPEAKER_21]: Anybody, I guess.

2447
02:59:53,451 --> 02:59:54,951
[SPEAKER_21]: He didn't direct it towards any particular person.

2448
02:59:57,573 --> 02:59:58,813
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I've played it.

2449
02:59:58,953 --> 03:00:02,315
[SPEAKER_18]: I have like two or three of the games on Saturn, so I've played it sometimes.

2450
03:00:02,355 --> 03:00:04,876
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll tell you right now, I have played Parodius, and it sucks.

2451
03:00:04,936 --> 03:00:05,456
[SPEAKER_19]: Play Gradius.

2452
03:00:05,536 --> 03:00:07,297
[SPEAKER_19]: God.

2453
03:00:07,997 --> 03:00:09,698
[SPEAKER_21]: I've played it for a little bit on Nintendo Emulator.

2454
03:00:10,459 --> 03:00:12,520
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, come on, don't play Gradius, play Life Force.

2455
03:00:13,721 --> 03:00:14,521
[SPEAKER_19]: Salamander, you mean?

2456
03:00:15,221 --> 03:00:15,902
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what I love?

2457
03:00:16,082 --> 03:00:18,643
[SPEAKER_21]: I love most about Parodius as the penguins.

2458
03:00:20,784 --> 03:00:25,986
[SPEAKER_19]: Just what you're playing, I don't know, I just, I think Gradius is still the classic Konami shooter.

2459
03:00:27,407 --> 03:00:29,188
[SPEAKER_19]: It's got burning heat in it, Gradius 2, so.

2460
03:00:30,989 --> 03:00:34,550
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, well, there's going to be a Gradius, what is it, 5 on PS2?

2461
03:00:35,310 --> 03:00:36,171
[SPEAKER_19]: That should be interesting.

2462
03:00:37,291 --> 03:00:38,432
[SPEAKER_19]: I hope they make it like, uh,

2463
03:00:39,545 --> 03:00:40,325
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it'll be good.

2464
03:00:42,206 --> 03:00:43,546
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yes, the new Contra.

2465
03:00:44,266 --> 03:00:44,927
[SPEAKER_19]: I haven't played it yet.

2466
03:00:46,527 --> 03:00:46,747
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

2467
03:00:47,767 --> 03:00:48,308
[SPEAKER_19]: Bad radio.

2468
03:00:48,488 --> 03:00:49,468
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, sorry.

2469
03:00:49,828 --> 03:00:56,410
[SPEAKER_21]: UK Bondage Boy wanted to back up something that Bradley had said in the last bit about Japan English.

2470
03:00:57,510 --> 03:00:59,791
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like having the screen name Nico Bubblegum.

2471
03:01:00,131 --> 03:01:02,652
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, let's be multicultural and trendy.

2472
03:01:02,672 --> 03:01:02,932
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, Rob.

2473
03:01:08,064 --> 03:01:09,185
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, last question.

2474
03:01:09,705 --> 03:01:11,246
[SPEAKER_21]: Last question for Ask Orange Lounge.

2475
03:01:11,266 --> 03:01:11,887
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, everybody.

2476
03:01:12,527 --> 03:01:17,070
[SPEAKER_21]: The last question is from Justin B. He wants to know, when will this show ever end?

2477
03:01:17,930 --> 03:01:18,971
[SPEAKER_21]: The answer is right now.

2478
03:01:19,031 --> 03:01:21,012
[SPEAKER_21]: So let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2479
03:01:21,473 --> 03:01:22,193
[SPEAKER_15]: Final thought.

2480
03:01:26,416 --> 03:01:32,339
[SPEAKER_15]: I know way too much things about my mother that I wish I never knew or heard uttered from her mouth.

2481
03:01:32,360 --> 03:01:33,060
[SPEAKER_16]: Diddy Garholic.

2482
03:01:37,046 --> 03:01:39,107
[SPEAKER_06]: English is very, very nice fun.

2483
03:01:39,327 --> 03:01:39,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2484
03:01:41,148 --> 03:01:42,429
[SPEAKER_21]: You want to go now, Loki, or at the end?

2485
03:01:42,909 --> 03:01:43,570
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't care, whatever.

2486
03:01:43,590 --> 03:01:44,070
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, Loki.

2487
03:01:45,411 --> 03:01:46,451
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, I guess I'm going now.

2488
03:01:46,871 --> 03:01:52,335
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't believe I missed Simpsons, and the TV is right here, but I was watching Most Extremely Nation Challenge, which I saw yesterday.

2489
03:01:53,015 --> 03:01:53,475
[SPEAKER_20]: Go fig.

2490
03:01:55,096 --> 03:01:55,596
[SPEAKER_20]: Whatever.

2491
03:01:55,857 --> 03:02:00,219
[SPEAKER_20]: I said, like, I was going to watch it every week now that I had the TV and cable, but no.

2492
03:02:00,679 --> 03:02:01,320
[SPEAKER_20]: Had to be stupid.

2493
03:02:01,360 --> 03:02:01,660
[SPEAKER_20]: Whatever.

2494
03:02:03,191 --> 03:02:05,593
[SPEAKER_21]: TheWretchedEvilIceQueen, and Haggad.

2495
03:02:08,696 --> 03:02:09,016
[SPEAKER_21]: That's it?

2496
03:02:10,538 --> 03:02:12,700
[SPEAKER_21]: Just deep panting for the Ice Queen.

2497
03:02:13,560 --> 03:02:14,241
[SPEAKER_19]: Take her now.

2498
03:02:14,501 --> 03:02:16,423
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a very serious final thought, everybody.

2499
03:02:16,683 --> 03:02:17,144
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, Brad?

2500
03:02:17,184 --> 03:02:17,604
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody!

2501
03:02:19,646 --> 03:02:21,888
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody, this is a serious... Come on!

2502
03:02:22,929 --> 03:02:23,950
[SPEAKER_19]: Very serious final thought.

2503
03:02:24,980 --> 03:02:28,902
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't care if you believe in God or any religion or praying at all.

2504
03:02:29,562 --> 03:02:34,804
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody please pray to Konami that Castlevania for PS2 is going to be a good game.

2505
03:02:35,184 --> 03:02:35,965
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not going to suck.

2506
03:02:36,325 --> 03:02:37,385
[SPEAKER_19]: It is very serious.

2507
03:02:37,485 --> 03:02:38,206
[SPEAKER_19]: I am very serious.

2508
03:02:38,246 --> 03:02:39,026
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody, please.

2509
03:02:39,506 --> 03:02:39,847
Amen.

2510
03:02:40,387 --> 03:02:40,667
[SPEAKER_19]: Amen.

2511
03:02:40,687 --> 03:02:41,827
[SPEAKER_19]: Can I get a witness in here?

2512
03:02:42,148 --> 03:02:43,428
[SPEAKER_20]: What are you talking about?

2513
03:02:43,448 --> 03:02:45,369
[SPEAKER_20]: When's the last time Konami's fucked something up?

2514
03:02:46,890 --> 03:02:48,230
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't get me started.

2515
03:02:48,810 --> 03:02:49,751
[SPEAKER_19]: We won't even utter.

2516
03:02:52,828 --> 03:02:54,608
[SPEAKER_19]: We're not going to mention that name on the radio.

2517
03:02:57,169 --> 03:02:58,529
[SPEAKER_21]: Rice Princess, final thought.

2518
03:02:58,570 --> 03:02:59,690
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of world is this?

2519
03:02:59,950 --> 03:03:00,890
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of crap.

2520
03:03:01,710 --> 03:03:01,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

2521
03:03:03,211 --> 03:03:04,351
[SPEAKER_21]: Bradley, final thought.

2522
03:03:05,231 --> 03:03:07,352
[SPEAKER_18]: Hooray for the random Oni course.

2523
03:03:07,812 --> 03:03:09,432
[SPEAKER_18]: It's evil and fun all wrapped into one.

2524
03:03:10,853 --> 03:03:11,493
[SPEAKER_21]: That was poetic.

2525
03:03:13,020 --> 03:03:26,985
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sure if Jamie were here, her final thought would be squee, or we, or I own you, or something like that, or Battle Royale something, or sleep, I need sleep, or let's go get tapioca, any of the above would be Jamie's final thought, I'm pretty sure.

2526
03:03:27,105 --> 03:03:30,466
[SPEAKER_21]: I would say with pretty good accuracy, I think I got it.
