WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.980
What's wrong?

00:30.000 --> 00:37.000
in this episode.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
I'm sorry, but all questions must be submitted in writing.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Why did they have to take the word gay?

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
No! What I expect from Spanish expressions is gay too.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Hey!

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Dark Sakura.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Shut up!

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Where's my gun?

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
This is my boom stick.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
Sky.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Come on girls, it's time to drop the bomb.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Loki.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
I can't, for the life of me, get the hooker to have sex with me.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
What kind of war human being would find that funny?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Let's get the intros out of the way.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
Ah, stupid McDonald's.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
It feels like there's a balloon in my stomach.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
And that's no good.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Ugh.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000

08:23.100 --> 08:29.980
I think you have my feelings But I'm so far away from you

08:29.980 --> 08:32.980
I think you have my feeling

08:32.980 --> 08:35.980
My heart's so far away for me

08:35.980 --> 08:38.980
Hey, can I feel it that way?

08:38.980 --> 08:41.980
Hey, can I just go for you?

08:41.980 --> 08:45.980
It's time to say goodnight, goodnight, baby

08:45.980 --> 08:47.980
I want you, love

08:47.980 --> 08:50.980
I'm ready to be empty

08:50.980 --> 08:54.980
It's my time for you to say goodnight

08:54.980 --> 08:59.980
Last name for you, you're the last to let me get to me

08:59.980 --> 09:04.980
You're the last, last name for you, I can't wait for

09:04.980 --> 09:07.980
I don't need any of your heart

09:09.980 --> 09:14.980
I'm not in love, I'm not in love

09:14.980 --> 09:19.980
I'm not in love, I'm not in love

09:49.980 --> 09:56.980
Hi, this is Mel B of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Mel B can join

09:57.820 --> 10:02.540
us on all the fun together. Hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come

10:02.540 --> 10:06.940
to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great.

10:06.940 --> 10:11.780
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights. Take it with me and you just might realize the

10:11.780 --> 10:18.780
best things in life are free. We're back, we're live, and people are still playing Animal

10:18.780 --> 10:20.780
I'm playing Animal Crossing, but that's okay.

10:20.780 --> 10:22.780
You can do your Animal Crack.

10:22.780 --> 10:23.780
Yeah, Animal Crack.

10:23.780 --> 10:25.780
We have one of our special guests up here, though.

10:25.780 --> 10:26.780
Say hi.

10:26.780 --> 10:27.780
Yo, what's up?

10:27.780 --> 10:29.780
This is Jay Kinetic representing Step Squad in the Bay Area.

10:29.780 --> 10:31.780
How you doing, Jamie?

10:31.780 --> 10:33.780
I'm on my way to intoxication.

10:33.780 --> 10:38.780
I see that you're already a glass ahead of me.

10:38.780 --> 10:39.780
That's right.

10:39.780 --> 10:43.780
Yeah, I got some Sky Vodka and Amp, actually a very good mix, and I just got the pleasure

10:43.780 --> 10:46.780
of coming out here to hang out tonight.

10:46.780 --> 10:56.780
Jessica and Ross are downstairs looking at Animal Crack. We've been trying to get them on a 12-step program for that, but they just won't go to the meetings. It's been really messed up.

10:56.780 --> 11:03.780
Ah! There's a microphone in my face! Shit! Yeah, Sky Vodka.

11:03.780 --> 11:09.780
I'll take phrases that Mariah Carey's gotten used to for 500. Ah! There's a microphone in my face!

11:09.780 --> 11:14.780
That was wrong. And how are you doing tonight?

11:14.780 --> 11:20.780
I was doing good until I ate something and that something happened to be McDonald's and then McDonald's is ripping me up.

11:21.780 --> 11:24.780
What you want is what you vomit at McDonald's today.

11:25.780 --> 11:30.780
Yes. McDonald's is going to need a PR campaign to undo all the damage you just did.

11:31.780 --> 11:38.780
Well actually yesterday I wasn't feeling too good either or the day before because I made this spaghetti with this really cool sauce I got off the internet.

11:38.780 --> 11:43.540
off the internet, like this recipe off of Robert and I don the radio show I listen to

11:43.540 --> 11:50.340
every morning and it was really good but the thing is that it calls for two full bulbs

11:50.340 --> 11:55.700
of garlic ground up along with a large red onion so you have pretty much like this half

11:55.700 --> 12:00.340
of it is onion and garlic and then the rest is all tomatoes and stuff and it's really

12:00.340 --> 12:01.340
good.

12:01.340 --> 12:05.740
The problem is when you have that much garlic you just eat a little bit of it and it makes

12:05.740 --> 12:10.360
your stomach really really gassy so well actually no the problem is you'll need

12:10.360 --> 12:13.400
about three bottles of Listerine after you eat two bulbs of garlic and a red

12:13.400 --> 12:16.520
onion I mean God you could probably breathe on somebody and it's probably

12:16.520 --> 12:24.600
like toxic yeah so it was really good it just it felt like you just a little bit

12:24.600 --> 12:27.800
of it you feel like full already and it's it's weird so we're just feeling

12:27.800 --> 12:32.520
you just feel full I don't know now the worst time I had was when I prepared

12:32.520 --> 12:38.080
some spaghetti. I was cooking for my ex at the time and she'd come over and I was cooking

12:38.080 --> 12:44.420
and I threw something that wasn't tobacco into the spaghetti sauce along with some alcohol.

12:44.420 --> 12:47.860
I didn't feel the effects for the first 30 minutes. I sat down to use my computer after

12:47.860 --> 12:51.860
she went home and all of a sudden they hit me like Vicodin and I was out. It was scary.

12:51.860 --> 12:56.580
Oh, there's Shermy if you look very slowly. Oh, she just went back under the thing. Shermy

12:56.580 --> 13:01.660
decided to peek out and say hi to everybody but then she went back under the bed. Oh,

13:01.660 --> 13:03.660
Baby

13:04.220 --> 13:09.820
So what's the topic tonight anyway topic the topic is Robert here party time

13:10.860 --> 13:15.200
Yeah, he decided to get down to that cyber beat nation thing. You know, huh?

13:17.380 --> 13:20.620
You know, they said like there's never a topic on the show come up here melody

13:22.420 --> 13:25.820
Yeah, we have our models in here tonight a dark soccer Melodies on her way up

13:25.820 --> 13:29.360
She's having a hard time getting up the stairs because the ammo crack is calling her say hi melody

13:29.360 --> 13:33.360
No, I'm having a hard time coming up the stairs because I'm half drunk.

13:33.360 --> 13:34.360
That's the reason why.

13:34.360 --> 13:35.360
Lightweight!

13:35.360 --> 13:36.360
Lightweight!

13:36.360 --> 13:40.680
Yes, I'm a lightweight, and I'm damn proud of it, okay?

13:40.680 --> 13:42.680
That means I'm a cheap date.

13:42.680 --> 13:46.000
Ooh, shout out to Mel down in Cyberbeat Nation.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000

13:49.560 --> 13:50.560
Okay, we're going to announce that.

13:50.560 --> 13:51.560

13:51.560 --> 13:52.560

14:45.600 --> 14:49.200

14:49.200 --> 14:52.520
I was just so pretty thrilled that Rob beat Ree at Fremont

14:52.520 --> 14:55.520
True, true. Respect the Tigger, though, because that's one of the coolest P.A.ers I've met.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.520
You never got an ego about this shit. Shouts to him.

14:57.520 --> 14:59.520
Okay. Um, Freestyle.

14:59.520 --> 15:03.520

Um, in fourth place, our very own Step Squad Boy, Wendell.

15:07.520 --> 15:09.520

15:12.520 --> 15:14.520
Yay, AJ!

15:14.520 --> 15:18.520
In second place, I think I got this right because I could barely hear Rob when he told me Master 42.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.520
If I have that wrong, I'll correct it.

15:20.520 --> 15:28.600

15:28.600 --> 15:32.080

that's a pretty good showing there for a for a NorCal so no no no we have to we

15:48.400 --> 15:53.200
have to be nice to our out-of-state people because keep in mind I lived in

15:53.200 --> 15:56.540
Alabama where we had no Bimani when I went there to visit April you know they

15:56.540 --> 16:04.600
had a Korean dance maniacs oh my god down in Newark down at Newark in New

16:04.600 --> 16:09.680
Park Mall I think Ross was with me when I played this they have dance maniacs in

16:09.680 --> 16:14.300
Korean it could dance freaks in Korean I've never played this game before I was

16:14.300 --> 16:18.140
I was amazed by this. I'm like, they have Korean songs with us? Didn't they have a

16:18.140 --> 16:19.820
Cleon, Funky tonight or something?

16:19.820 --> 16:22.500
No, they didn't have Funky tonight. They had another Clon song.

16:22.500 --> 16:27.260
They had another Clon song. They had a Big Young song. Big Young,

16:27.260 --> 16:30.560
as we all know, did a Budong from DDR.

16:30.560 --> 16:34.820
And so she has a song called Dash on Dance Freaks. And I was just amazed. I was like,

16:34.820 --> 16:36.020
wow, and it's only a quarter!

16:36.020 --> 16:39.780
Dude! Yeah, this thing is cheap. It's the winner, dude. It's the winner. Now if, like, people in New

16:39.780 --> 16:41.660
Park Mall could quit bar hopping, life would be great.

16:41.660 --> 16:48.300
Well, they had one at the fair last year, the year before.

16:48.300 --> 16:54.000
I found out that they recently got a Beatmania, an actual Beatmania machine, just in the hallway

16:54.000 --> 16:58.540
at the mall outside the movie theater that the mall I used to work at, which, from what

16:58.540 --> 17:01.840
I understand it correctly, is actually where my arcade used to be, but they moved the arcade

17:01.840 --> 17:02.840
further down.

17:02.840 --> 17:05.960
Yeah, in Latin's Castle.

17:05.960 --> 17:08.920
I worked for Namco at one time.

17:08.920 --> 17:11.240
average at uh... at uh...

17:11.240 --> 17:13.360
said his own

17:13.360 --> 17:15.320
presentation

17:15.320 --> 17:19.020
earlier of this show this uh... so far as well as it brought to you by islanders

17:19.020 --> 17:23.320

17:24.960 --> 17:27.840
locked up

17:27.840 --> 17:29.240

17:29.240 --> 17:32.080
he just wouldn't let me by the slits i want to show it

17:32.080 --> 17:36.520
i want to show that i want to represent it's let me know you know you know

17:36.520 --> 17:40.320
What you need is an ice-cold Colt.45.

17:40.320 --> 17:43.000
You know, if you didn't have that, I would've, I would've, like, you would've let me!

17:43.000 --> 17:47.920
Somewhere Billy Dee Williams is having a cry. I know, I know he is.

17:47.920 --> 17:52.920
You're being awfully... He's just so smooth. You're being awfully quiet.

17:52.920 --> 17:56.920
Yeah, that's because I feel like a blimp. I feel fat.

17:56.920 --> 18:00.520
And sassy. And sassy.

18:00.520 --> 18:02.520
I'm feeling hot and sassy!

18:30.520 --> 18:35.520
video comes from, what you need is an ice cold Colt.45.

18:35.520 --> 18:39.040
Worst commercial ever, it's not like it made anybody look bad or anything. I mean, Colt

18:39.040 --> 18:43.640
.45, Schlitz, Red Dog, all those urban beers, I don't think I've ever touched one just because

18:43.640 --> 18:47.400
they taste like water and piss. You know, when I lived in, I lived in the

18:47.400 --> 18:57.120
hood at one time. Del Paso Heights. I mean, you could tell at one time, maybe back in

18:57.120 --> 19:02.700
it was a nice neighborhood but the the place was all like you know the houses

19:02.700 --> 19:06.500
were there were some you know HUD houses and dogs running down the street people

19:06.500 --> 19:10.180
go down with their loud bass I'm trying to sleep before the morning and on New

19:10.180 --> 19:16.260
Year's Eve our friend Tina we call her beanie she came over while we were

19:16.260 --> 19:19.820
having our big automate marathon we're watching um what were we watching

19:19.820 --> 19:25.340
cowboy bebop and we were playing somebody amigo and she brought me a 40

19:25.340 --> 19:31.740
Corona and said and I but I felt inclined to go drink it on my couch but

19:31.740 --> 19:39.260
I didn't have chairs or a couch so yeah that's the sad thing I mean I'm from the

19:39.260 --> 19:43.460
slums like originally spent like half of my existence in Oakland California and

19:43.460 --> 19:47.580
what's sad about Oakland is that there are three things that you will find in

19:47.580 --> 19:52.580
most neighborhoods and that's a liquor store a nail a nail shop and like a

19:52.580 --> 19:56.980
a church. You'll find those all within a black proximity of each other.

19:56.980 --> 20:01.480
There are five churches by my house in DPH. You don't need five churches in one

20:01.480 --> 20:02.840
neighborhood, that's scary.

20:02.840 --> 20:07.360
But we saw this and they'd all be selling the most crappy beers on the planet. We're

20:07.360 --> 20:08.500
talking like Natural

20:08.500 --> 20:12.920
Ice and like Schlitz and like Red Dog. You name it and it's a kettle beer that you

20:12.920 --> 20:15.400
probably saw in the advertisement for and the source, they had it.

20:15.400 --> 20:19.180
And it was just bad and you knew it was a rig up. But you couldn't do anything about it.

20:19.180 --> 20:25.180
So I guess the idea was you drank your Mad Dog 2020 and went to church because that was the only way you could put up with the people there. I'm not sure.

20:25.180 --> 20:30.180
Well, you know what? It's funny that we're talking about alcohol on a Bimani show.

20:30.180 --> 20:31.180
Yeah!

20:31.180 --> 20:34.180
Have you ever tried to play DDR drunk?

20:34.180 --> 20:41.180
I'm happy to say that I got a ton of perfects while I was off of four TGI Friday drinks, despite the fact that they were weak.

20:41.180 --> 20:45.180
I was not drunk enough yet, so I went to the store, got two pints of Sopetto beer. Good stuff.

20:45.180 --> 20:49.440
stuff. Went out to the DDR machine and was scoring B's and A's all day. It's all about

20:49.440 --> 20:51.280
drunk-drunk revolution.

20:51.280 --> 20:58.200
First night I met Wendell at Fauna Mae of 2001. He proceeded to beat Afrinova Maniac

20:58.200 --> 21:05.520
while drunk. And I don't think he's been able to do it sober, right? That was awesome.

21:05.520 --> 21:11.160
I'm not quite sure. I would DDR naked with the right person, but you'd have to have a

21:11.160 --> 21:13.640
private machine, because I don't want my wang flopping around.

21:13.640 --> 21:17.640
We don't have upskirt can, thank you very much. I have played DDR in my pajamas.

21:17.640 --> 21:21.640
But, if you're a woman playing DDR without a bra, it's painful.

21:21.640 --> 21:22.640
Yeah, I can imagine.

21:22.640 --> 21:27.640
And when we do have our private machine, no one will be playing Naked Naked Revolution on it.

21:27.640 --> 21:32.640
Why not? Doubles Maniac could get really fun if you had two cute people.

21:32.640 --> 21:35.640
That's the moment I go, woo!

21:35.640 --> 21:40.640
Well anyway, how about our sim update, or is there a lack thereof today?

21:40.640 --> 21:49.480
Actually, there's quite a bit going on. New StepMania, our new CVS update for the, what

21:49.480 --> 21:57.720
was it, February 12th CVS snapshot for that. They're really making it sort of like, it's

21:57.720 --> 22:03.560
becoming more of an actual arcade type, you know, program. You can actually probably put

22:03.560 --> 22:07.220
it in an arcade machine and run it and it'd be like an arcade machine. You can actually

22:07.220 --> 22:11.700
have now, they have options to disable all the options screens and whatnot so you can

22:11.700 --> 22:17.000
actually play. And they have, you can hook up, you know, coins stuff to it and it's really

22:17.000 --> 22:22.580
cool. They also have added like, you know, Marvelous' and a whole bunch of new modifiers

22:22.580 --> 22:27.020
on there now. They have one that's called Land which is just like in the Oni course

22:27.020 --> 22:33.400
trick. It's got a, it's kind of a reverse boost where it slows way down. They have one

22:33.400 --> 22:40.560
called Expand where it kind of just expands and contracts as it goes up the screen and

22:40.560 --> 22:45.820
then they've got, man, they've got a bunch of weird stuff but it's all like kind of stuff

22:45.820 --> 22:52.540
inspired by DDR Extreme, they'll be kind of putting a lot of new things in there. Supposedly

22:52.540 --> 22:57.280
there's supposed to be 2DX and BeatMania support added in but I haven't seen anything about

22:57.280 --> 23:03.760
that yet. But, yeah, that stuff's coming up. Still working on my website. I'm taking my

23:03.760 --> 23:09.320
time though because I'm going to be adding CD titles to everything and just making sure

23:09.320 --> 23:15.040
it's, you know, fully done that way. I have a full set of DDRxtreme sim files that will

23:15.040 --> 23:23.040
be coming up. Everything that's released so far, of course. And then, let's see what else.

23:23.040 --> 23:25.040
Oh, I don't know, a whole bunch of shit.

23:25.040 --> 23:34.040
Oh, DWI Insanity, they just released a U-Trans number 2 non-stop DWI.

23:34.040 --> 23:36.040
It's 35 minutes long.

23:36.040 --> 23:38.040
You can play it last night.

23:38.040 --> 23:42.040
After about 20 minutes, your hand just...

23:42.040 --> 23:44.040
It doesn't hurt anymore, but...

23:44.040 --> 23:45.040
Yeah, that was pretty fun.

23:45.040 --> 23:47.040
And then, let's see, other than that,

23:47.040 --> 23:57.040
Other than that, Bhimani Cell switched to a new server thanks to kind donations from the community and so they should be bringing up more SIM files on that site too.

23:57.040 --> 24:07.040
Probably see the rest of the DDRXtreme stuff come up and same with DDRUK, they've just re-put up all their new stuff on new server so check those out also.

24:07.040 --> 24:19.040
Aside from that, just keep watching DDR Maniacs and Bobonni Sims and you'll find some more sim files and keep waiting to hear about my website which should be coming up as soon as I work on it.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.040
That's it.

24:21.040 --> 24:24.040
We should also make a mention about our contest.

24:24.040 --> 24:46.040
Our old TV themed DWI contest, we don't really have a due date yet, but it's going to be done to any old TV theme, only TV themes. Or were we doing just TV themes? Yeah, so old TV themes, DWI. No remixes. Original TV themes.

24:46.040 --> 24:51.040
I want to see some of those TV themes. I want to see, like, Greatest American Hero.

24:51.040 --> 24:57.040
I want to see Silver Spoons. I want to see the A-Team. If somebody did one to Small Wonder, that'd be crazy.

24:57.040 --> 25:01.040
I looked for the Small Wonder theme to play on the pre-show, and I couldn't find it.

25:01.040 --> 25:07.040
I've only got one TV theme that's actually into a DWI, and that's an Ash Bridges theme.

25:07.040 --> 25:12.040
Damn. You know what one would be fun? I just thought of Bonanza.

25:12.040 --> 25:15.040
duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh banana

25:17.040 --> 25:19.040
I am a banana!

25:20.040 --> 25:23.040
My suit is too big!

25:23.040 --> 25:25.040
You're watching a family learning channel.

25:28.040 --> 25:29.040
You!

25:29.040 --> 25:31.040
My guy, Airwolf.

25:31.040 --> 25:32.040
Yes!

25:32.040 --> 25:36.040
No, no, I just had it. The Price is Right would be a good one.

25:36.040 --> 25:40.040
The other one that I wanted to see. God, it was just in my brain.

25:40.040 --> 25:43.040
The years of marijuana fucked me up.

25:43.040 --> 25:47.440
Batman would be pretty cool. They're throwing him out in the chat room now.

25:47.440 --> 25:51.120
We've got the chat room up here live. If you had already joined the chat room, what server are they on?

25:51.120 --> 25:54.280
It's

25:54.280 --> 25:58.120
otherside.irc.net

25:58.120 --> 26:02.800
Just go to orangeloungelounge.skie.cx

26:02.800 --> 26:07.560
and there's a link there to our channel. If you want one that's kind of a related

26:07.560 --> 26:12.640
TV hip-hop theme to New York undercover, kick-ass intro music, use that.

26:12.640 --> 26:15.720
WKRP

26:15.720 --> 26:20.780
I am! Okay. MASH! We're taking a special break right now

26:20.780 --> 26:23.880
because you just freakin' named the show.

26:23.880 --> 26:27.920
Give me a second, I have this here. I have the full version of this.

26:27.920 --> 26:31.920
We're taking a break. WKRP in Cincinnati.

26:57.920 --> 27:01.920
Cincinnati WKRP

27:01.920 --> 27:05.920
Got kinda tired of packin' and unpackin'

27:05.920 --> 27:09.920
Town to town, up and down the dial

27:09.920 --> 27:13.920
Maybe you and me were never meant to be

27:13.920 --> 27:17.920
Just maybe think of me once in a while

27:17.920 --> 27:32.480
And that's enough of that, yes the WKRP in Cincinnati theme.

27:32.480 --> 27:33.480
You know what?

27:33.480 --> 27:37.800
I was, I don't know how old I was when that show was on, it was like, there's Shermy!

27:37.800 --> 27:40.080
Oh, she's back under bed.

27:40.080 --> 27:43.240
Shermy decided there were too many people downstairs and came up here.

27:43.240 --> 27:45.880
Um, saved by the fucking bell.

27:45.880 --> 27:50.880
You know, what's-her-face from that show went on to be in Showgirls and show her boobs and her ass to the world?

27:50.880 --> 27:52.880
Elizabeth Berkley.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.880
Well, so did Tiffany Amber Thiessen.

27:54.880 --> 27:57.880
She's stupid, though.

27:57.880 --> 28:02.880
I don't know, a bunch of crap. She was on Beverly Hills 90210.

28:02.880 --> 28:04.880
I'm sure she got naked at some point.

28:04.880 --> 28:10.880
I know. I'm sure she's a slut. Yeah.

28:10.880 --> 28:13.880
So if you were on Saved by the Bell, then you'd have to turn into a hoe.

28:13.880 --> 28:15.880
You know Kim Fields was in a Belvedevo video?

28:43.880 --> 28:49.880
You can tell that the character, it went through her mind that, you know, she's gonna have sex with this, like, 16-year-old kid.

28:49.880 --> 28:55.880
So, you know, she was a slut in that, too, so... I don't know. But she sucked.

28:55.880 --> 29:02.880
Elizabeth, uh, Berkley. She's played everything that she's been, and she's been, like, a slut.

29:02.880 --> 29:07.880
Dude, okay. Now, I admit she was hot back in the day on Saved by the Bell, okay? Long way ch- you know, she was alright looking.

29:07.880 --> 29:10.880
Even though she was- I don't know if she was brown or blonde back then, but she was okay.

29:10.880 --> 29:15.280
The thing that turned me off to Elizabeth Berkley was the pool scene in Showgirl.

29:15.280 --> 29:20.580
Some of you remember this. I swear to God the woman was having a seizure because a light went bad in the freaking pool.

29:20.580 --> 29:29.180
What the hell happened? I've been in bed a little bit. I have not seen anybody have an orgasm like that.

29:29.180 --> 29:33.780
If you have an orgasm like that, put a message out in the chat room. That was scary.

29:33.780 --> 29:36.380
I was afraid she was having a heart attack. I don't know what the hell happened.

29:36.380 --> 29:41.380
she looked like a fucking shark grabbed onto his nuts like just thrashing in the

29:41.380 --> 29:41.960
water

29:41.960 --> 29:47.060
I don't know, it was weird. Oh my god, what the hell's going on?

29:47.060 --> 29:51.980
What the hell was wrong with her? God! You fucked him without

29:51.980 --> 29:56.460
fucking him! Okay, you kinda have to fuck them in order to fuck them

29:56.460 --> 30:01.460
but if you weren't fucking them, how were you fucking them?

30:01.460 --> 30:05.540
last week on orange and radio

30:05.540 --> 30:07.700
the whole movie is awful

30:07.700 --> 30:10.500
every time i watched it like fall asleep

30:10.500 --> 30:11.300
actually

30:11.300 --> 30:12.280
scare your scene

30:12.280 --> 30:15.720
i just saw this movie uh... i was watching it over at whose house was i

30:15.720 --> 30:18.080
just over at the other day watching this

30:18.080 --> 30:19.760
tony's my good friend tony

30:19.760 --> 30:22.260
uh... kuno one two six was up to him

30:22.260 --> 30:24.380
techy guy represents otaku outposts

30:24.380 --> 30:26.220
we saw this movie itu mama tambien

30:26.220 --> 30:28.840
uh... and your mother's okay you've seen this

30:28.840 --> 30:33.160
Okay, there's a scene, in the movie, two guys who are pretty close friends, right?

30:33.160 --> 30:36.500
The movie gets wackier, so I still suggest you go out and see us.

30:36.500 --> 30:39.840
Um, one of the parents, okay, one of the kids is kinda rich, the other one's kinda poor, but

30:39.840 --> 30:42.960
let's still get down, I think the other kinda poor kid's middle class. Anyway,

30:42.960 --> 30:47.040
they're at a country club, you know this scene, they're at a country club,

30:47.040 --> 30:50.480
they're on two opposite diving boards talking, while

30:50.480 --> 30:54.800
they're, you know, fapping. And it gets scarier because they go to a,

30:54.800 --> 30:57.980
they go to a shot, it's bad enough that you see them fapping on the two diving boards

30:57.980 --> 30:59.660
at this country club in public

30:59.660 --> 31:00.980
but the killer scene

31:00.980 --> 31:02.180
is when you see

31:02.180 --> 31:04.420
the spoons hit the water

31:04.420 --> 31:06.220
they put this scene in the movie

31:06.220 --> 31:09.740
why i don't want to see the spoons at the water

31:09.740 --> 31:12.480
that's just not cool

31:12.480 --> 31:14.700
here's an indicate he and i

31:14.700 --> 31:16.020
too much information radio

31:16.020 --> 31:20.140
well there's also the other scene where they started making out to the two guys

31:20.140 --> 31:22.660
are making out when they're with the one chick

31:22.660 --> 31:27.940
I want that movie. I like seeing guys make out. I mean, you're saying?

31:27.940 --> 31:33.700
I don't have a single problem with guys making out. If a guy's cute enough, I'd probably make out with him, but...

31:33.700 --> 31:36.580
Okay, two guys making out, that's one thing.

31:36.580 --> 31:40.420
At that point in the movie, we didn't need to see, you know, they pretty much

31:40.420 --> 31:43.660
had it established, they were pretty homophobic. We did not need to see the

31:43.660 --> 31:46.180
spooge hit the water.

31:46.180 --> 31:49.820
Mel just, Melody's in here now. Say hi, Melody.

31:49.820 --> 31:55.820
issues was just came in as i said that now she's got a shirt

31:55.820 --> 31:57.760
perhaps we should get back to it

31:57.760 --> 32:00.260
said to uh... to the accident

32:00.260 --> 32:01.600
bt

32:01.600 --> 32:03.660
and everything

32:03.660 --> 32:05.440
and is having the end

32:05.440 --> 32:09.600
mental image that i did not need

32:09.600 --> 32:14.780
as a result of the heads up or with the tales that has foreign

32:14.780 --> 32:18.160
so formal is a good time to take a look at our take a look at the old samurai

32:18.160 --> 32:22.160
There are some good foreign movies out there.

32:22.160 --> 32:26.160
Um, Run Lola Run. That movie's kick-ass and that's foreign, you know?

32:26.160 --> 32:30.160
It just depends on what you watch. I just don't want to see Spooge hit the water.

32:30.160 --> 32:34.160
That just messed up my day.

32:34.160 --> 32:37.160
Oh, man. There's nothing...

32:37.160 --> 32:42.160
Why isn't there anything going on in the fucking Bamani community, other than the stupid tournament?

32:42.160 --> 32:44.160
I mean...

32:44.160 --> 32:52.160
Konami of Japan decided to, you know, pretty much rape us and shut down their, um, you know, American arcade division over here, if I'm correct.

32:52.160 --> 32:58.160
Um, we haven't had out anything besides Eurobeat songs on DDR, I'm still waiting to find a machine that has the club mixes on it.

32:58.160 --> 33:02.160
And, uh, you know, I'd really like for them to open up the code to that, although I don't think they will.

33:02.160 --> 33:05.160
It'd be kinda cool if I could make my own DDR mix.

33:05.160 --> 33:08.160
There's tons of songs on there, but hey, you know, that's why.

33:08.160 --> 33:13.160
But I'm glad that there's nothing going on, because nothing going on means people are playing rather than starting drama, and that's a beautiful thing.

33:13.160 --> 33:16.160
Because that means that there's less stupid people that I have to slap.

33:17.160 --> 33:20.160
Actually, we're in the process of finding the code right now.

33:20.160 --> 33:23.160
We have people working on it night and day.

33:23.160 --> 33:25.160
Um, yeah, doing that kind of thing.

33:25.160 --> 33:28.160
Actually, I'm getting closer and closer to being able to rip more stuff out of there.

33:28.160 --> 33:33.160
I just got a thing to rip videos out of, um, PlayStation 2, uh, Bamani games.

33:33.160 --> 33:34.160
I haven't...

33:34.160 --> 33:38.160
Problem is, the program's Japanese, so I have no fucking clue what it wants me to do.

33:38.160 --> 33:40.160
Is this the Fuck You show?

33:40.160 --> 33:42.160
No, this is a real show.

33:42.160 --> 33:46.160
Oh darn yeah, we're going to do the fuck yous later, okay?

33:46.160 --> 33:49.120
I'll save it for then cuz I wanted I don't want to mess up anything

33:49.640 --> 33:53.160
Dark soccer is cruising a really cool calm. I'm a boy government

33:53.640 --> 33:57.120
Went to that I met him shortly after the destruction at MGL

33:57.120 --> 34:00.080
Thanks to a change Oh Phoenix and a bunch of the crazy MFS

34:00.460 --> 34:04.360
So go to that site be marks calm if you haven't already went there actually I think Phoenix is a door

34:05.240 --> 34:07.800
Information gathering and news for them now to a really cool guy

34:07.800 --> 34:13.000
down in L.A. What's up to him and Just Jay, Envision, other heads down there, Supply,

34:13.000 --> 34:14.400
Jobstun, whatever the hell he is.

34:14.400 --> 34:19.600
Well, it looks like, well, as far as new stuff coming out, I mean, it looks like GuitarFreak's

34:19.600 --> 34:25.800
9th and Drummania 8th are supposed to be coming out next month, and, you know, you're gonna

34:25.800 --> 34:31.000
have Beatmania 7th and the final coming out to PlayStation 2.

34:31.000 --> 34:34.800
So is that Beatmania 7th the final mix for Beatmania, so I'm assuming that everything's

34:34.800 --> 34:38.800
is going to be set to 2DX after that?

34:38.800 --> 34:41.800
Yeah, it's pretty much, it's the final and 7th.

34:41.800 --> 34:43.800
Hello, I totally forgot!

34:43.800 --> 34:47.800
Another DDR Extreme code was released this week.

34:47.800 --> 34:51.800
Unlocking a couple more non-SOC courses and more ONI courses.

34:51.800 --> 34:54.800
Including in those ONI courses, they've got, you know,

34:54.800 --> 34:58.800
Sakura is one of the playable songs in one of the ONI courses.

34:58.800 --> 35:02.800
Along with, let's see what else, Xenon is in one of them.

35:02.800 --> 35:16.800
And Dance Dance Revolution is in one of them, and finally in one of the non-stop courses, Heaven is 57 Gray. I forget the fucking song.

35:16.800 --> 35:26.800
Honestly, if you are looking, I don't know how many heads have or haven't wanted to play it, if you haven't had a chance to play it yet, please go out and play Guitar Freaks.

35:26.800 --> 35:30.220
it's an excellent game, and I feel it's kind of been slept on. There are a few people,

35:30.220 --> 35:34.940
you know, most people don't go between, don't go beyond DDR and I'd say Beatmania, but if

35:34.940 --> 35:39.340
you have to expand to another element, definitely go Guitar Freaks. It's one of the most fun

35:39.340 --> 35:44.020
games I've had. Dancemania X is another fun one, I'll let you just mention that, but Guitar

35:44.020 --> 35:47.940
Freaks is one of my favorites. It has kick-ass music, you know, if you're into rock at all,

35:47.940 --> 35:51.060
you know, plenty of stuff to make you want to jump around and just sit back with something

35:51.060 --> 35:57.100
a little bit more laid back. Um. And then later, earlier this week, I gotta play more

35:57.100 --> 36:03.940
Qzar, cause that was fun. Heh heh heh. Same place? Yeah, same place. Played on the fifth

36:03.940 --> 36:10.460
mix in Max 2 again. That fifth mix is fucked up. Oh my god. It's just, all the paths don't

36:10.460 --> 36:15.220
work. That's it. Nothing sucks more than when you go to an arcade and you've already dealt

36:15.220 --> 36:18.840
with somebody who's been talking to, uh, you know, a gang of shit, and you can't kick their

36:18.840 --> 36:30.320
ass because the machine sucks. Yeah. What's that? Yay. Okay. Um, again guys, I'm really

36:30.320 --> 36:35.280
sorry and thank you so much for, um, thank you so much for bearing with me on this. I'm

36:35.280 --> 36:41.480
gonna go ahead and get, here, you talk. Don't bear with us. You're privileged to be listening

36:41.480 --> 36:49.920
to us you will deal with any hardships that you yeah yeah give me that okay I'm going

36:49.920 --> 36:56.920
um... to break

37:19.920 --> 37:22.720
Play me for you, make it tough

37:22.720 --> 37:25.720
Lying on your back, playing for rock n' stuff

37:25.720 --> 37:28.520
Home as a boot camp, you gotta escape

37:28.520 --> 37:30.920
All the trouble running from this, you gotta take it

37:30.920 --> 37:35.120
You feel, you feel, you feel, you feel, you feel

37:35.120 --> 37:37.920
You gotta be who you're sitting for

37:37.920 --> 37:42.720
So young, so young, you need to do your thing

37:42.720 --> 37:45.520
Who you're sitting for

37:45.520 --> 37:47.520
Never had for a long day

37:47.520 --> 37:50.520
But you're the one who knows the city more

37:50.520 --> 37:53.520
It's like we're having a movie for a play

37:58.520 --> 38:01.520
The heat is amazing, the heat is real

38:01.520 --> 38:04.520
Check out all the hype and the fantasy

38:04.520 --> 38:06.520

43:59.260 --> 44:02.260
Body language is controlled by rhythm

44:02.260 --> 44:04.260
Music is the universal wave

44:04.260 --> 44:08.260
Feel this, feel me, huh, huh

44:08.260 --> 44:10.260
Think of this world without sound

44:10.260 --> 44:12.260
Can't even feel a heart pound

44:12.260 --> 44:15.260
Wasting time, wasting life, wasting self

44:15.260 --> 44:17.260
You're a media elf

44:17.260 --> 44:19.260
Show me your drum and I'll beat on it

44:19.260 --> 44:21.260

45:48.840 --> 46:00.840
Ooh, Santa, here is a season for you to fly from the far.

46:00.840 --> 46:11.840
Ooh, Santa, here is a season for you to fly from the far.

47:11.840 --> 47:23.040
Yay, we're back!

47:23.040 --> 47:26.800
I'm on drink number four, which is more of that chocolate.

47:26.800 --> 47:29.920
It's vanilla soy milk and Godiva liqueur.

47:29.920 --> 47:32.880
How is it, Noldy?

47:32.880 --> 47:37.440
It's gone now, I already drank it, it's really yummy, actually.

47:37.440 --> 47:40.840
I'm about to work on that drink myself, I'm working through a mixture of apple juice and

47:40.840 --> 47:46.680
sky vodka right now so it's good it's good stuff um i already had two with amp in it

47:46.680 --> 47:50.280

47:56.440 --> 48:07.840
good that's a really yummy drink ross fuck all right we don't know the other one tonari

48:07.840 --> 48:10.840
If you're ever in Sacramento, go to Toonari Sushi. Good stuff.

48:10.840 --> 48:16.840
Right by Dark Sakura's house. You can come and be on Orange Lounge Radio, too, if you're cool.

48:16.840 --> 48:24.840
We're all drinking, except for our designated host.

48:24.840 --> 48:30.840
Yeah, I'm staying sober, so I can be boring. I have to be the dull end of the show.

48:30.840 --> 48:34.840
I mean, are you strange or anything, Loki? Do you drink normally, or what's going on?

48:34.840 --> 48:36.840
No, I don't drink normally.

48:36.840 --> 48:38.840
Any particular reason or?

48:39.620 --> 48:42.260
Because I think I'll probably get violent and hurt people

48:43.860 --> 48:48.700
That's cool angry angry angry drunks suck. I've only experienced two don't come around me if you're an angry drunk

48:49.420 --> 48:53.000
We need to do is get you entirely shit-faced and take you to golf lab

48:54.700 --> 48:58.220
No get well actually no we don't want to give him shit face and take him to a strip bar one

48:58.220 --> 48:59.920
Yeah, golf land would be good

48:59.920 --> 49:02.660
So he can murder all the silly stupid Roosevelt children

49:02.660 --> 49:06.940
Good video of that.

49:06.940 --> 49:10.620
I would pay money to see that.

49:10.620 --> 49:14.780
Yes, Mongo Child does rock.

49:14.780 --> 49:19.140
Melody and I have had Mongo Child two days in a row at the same place in Roseville, at

49:19.140 --> 49:20.700
Great Wall in Roseville.

49:20.700 --> 49:21.700
That was...

49:21.700 --> 49:22.700
Hi.

49:22.700 --> 49:23.700
Hi.

49:23.700 --> 49:24.700
Say hi.

49:24.700 --> 49:25.700
Hi.

49:25.700 --> 49:26.700
This is Iguana Girl.

49:26.700 --> 49:27.700
Oh, my God.

49:27.700 --> 49:28.700
Whee!

49:28.700 --> 49:32.180
She's been playing Animal Crack.

49:32.180 --> 49:35.180
She's, she's another one of our, our designated people.

49:37.180 --> 49:40.180
Cause we're, the rest of us are well on our way.

49:40.180 --> 49:45.180
I can stop playing the game as soon as I pay off another 500,000 bells.

49:47.180 --> 49:53.180
I'm waiting for the first report in, uh, the news from Animal Crossing that somebody ran into somebody on accident

49:53.180 --> 49:59.180
or had a speeding violation because they were waiting to get home to do something in Animal Crossing.

49:59.180 --> 50:05.180
Well, I have actually seen spots on the road that are like potholes or whatever that look like the little star in Animal Crossing.

50:05.180 --> 50:09.180
And the first thing that crossed my mind was, I need to get my shovel and dig it up.

50:09.180 --> 50:14.180
There's a serious addiction problem here. We're trying to get Melody and Jessica into a 12-step.

50:14.180 --> 50:19.180
We're working on that, but we haven't managed to do it today.

50:19.180 --> 50:26.100
You see, now, I almost, you know, I used to be like, no, I actually never really was like

50:26.100 --> 50:29.060
that, but, you know, sure, I'd want to get back, you know, so I could do shit on Animal

50:29.060 --> 50:34.260
Crossing, but that was until I learned about the wonders of turning back the internal clock,

50:34.260 --> 50:38.260
in to which case you could play days before and that kind of fun stuff.

50:38.260 --> 50:42.720
I'm on the live journal Animal Crossing community, and one person responds, will actually refer

50:42.720 --> 50:45.420
to that as clock fondling.

50:45.420 --> 50:46.420
Greatest term ever.

50:46.420 --> 50:51.420
See, here's my problem with Animal Crossing. There's not enough violence in the damn game.

50:51.420 --> 50:56.420
For example, Tom Nook. That son of a bitch needs to get a bullet right between the eyes for how rude he is.

50:56.420 --> 51:02.420
I'm sick of that shit. Every time I've seen somebody go to that goddamn store, that asshole sits there,

51:02.420 --> 51:09.420
okay, oh, you wanna come into my store? You need to be able to snatch him from behind the counter and beat his ass in that game for being an asshole.

51:09.420 --> 51:11.420
Sick of this!

51:11.420 --> 51:14.420
He's like a little Chinese woman that's running the store.

51:14.420 --> 51:15.420
or

51:15.420 --> 51:16.420
oh

51:16.420 --> 51:17.420
oh

51:17.420 --> 51:18.420
you want verdict?

51:18.420 --> 51:19.420
you want verdict?

51:19.420 --> 51:24.980
and then you go upstairs and there's like two and it's like oh my god he screwed you

51:24.980 --> 51:25.980
okay that was dirty

51:25.980 --> 51:26.980
that was dirty

51:26.980 --> 51:31.740
but that's the truth man you need a punch button see if it was gta 3 vice city somebody

51:31.740 --> 51:35.220
pisses you off you pull a shotgun out and fucking erase their ass

51:35.220 --> 51:38.660

I'll stab that bitch in the eye.

53:21.600 --> 53:23.340
What was it? Okay.

53:23.340 --> 53:28.240
I saw this. There's one animal in our town, Lucy. She has the backyard theme in her house.

53:28.240 --> 53:31.840
What the fuck? Why make your house look like your backyard?

53:31.840 --> 53:34.780
That's the dumbest thing. I want to live in my backyard!

53:34.780 --> 53:38.700
cuz you're fucking retard another thing iguana girl perfectly peaceful player

53:38.700 --> 53:41.860
was going around today doing errands around people what's the name of that

53:41.860 --> 53:48.540
dumb bitch start with a P ears Pippi that dumb bitch needs to die too she

53:48.540 --> 53:51.300
wanted to just ask simple question do you have any jobs well no I actually

53:51.300 --> 53:54.340
don't I'm gonna take some of your shit because you can't do anything about it

53:54.340 --> 54:00.980
haha no hit her in the head with a fucking shovel I want death now back on the entire

54:00.980 --> 54:07.180
I don't remember who it is, but someone has a freaking bathroom.

54:07.180 --> 54:11.220
There's a bunch of exotic screens and toilets behind them all, and a plant and a garbage

54:11.220 --> 54:12.220
can.

54:12.220 --> 54:13.220
It's a freaking bathroom!

54:13.220 --> 54:17.500
That's what I want in my house, is to make it a public toilet.

54:17.500 --> 54:18.500
Greatest room ever.

54:18.500 --> 54:23.960
Because the greatest thing you can have in your house in Animal Crossing is a porta-potty.

54:23.960 --> 54:30.220
You know, we're missing The Simpsons, the 300th episode, with no cable.

54:30.220 --> 54:35.980
If you want the bathroom theme in your house, by the way, all you need is six toilets, the

54:35.980 --> 54:43.180
exotic screen, the exotic wall, the plaza tile, the trash can, and I think a cone, and

54:43.180 --> 54:44.180
a plant.

54:44.180 --> 54:46.900
And sadly enough, I remember what each of the items are.

54:46.900 --> 54:50.220
Because I really want to relive the experience of going to San Francisco and trying to find

54:50.220 --> 54:53.500
a public bathroom to use after getting drunk, you know?

54:53.500 --> 54:58.820
Nothing sticks out to me like trying to walk over the feces on the floor, and I really

54:58.820 --> 55:02.340
we want that public bathroom team in it

55:02.340 --> 55:04.420
process still done

55:04.420 --> 55:09.200

Yay! It's over! It's Pokemon and Eurobeat. It's like evil.

58:40.100 --> 58:46.020
I don't know. I was able to ignore the whole song. That was great.

58:46.020 --> 58:48.020
You can't find Digimon easy now.

59:16.020 --> 59:21.300
In fact, you can't even tell it because the URL is broken.

59:21.300 --> 59:27.500
As soon as my CD is freaking recognized, there we go.

59:27.500 --> 59:32.340
Yeah, I'm going to play something that if you've seen any of the Japanese Digimon,

59:32.340 --> 59:33.220
you'll recognize.

59:33.220 --> 59:40.220
It's a short track, so here you go, eventually.

01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:05.220
Fire

01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:53.300
I think we should go to our favorite part of the show, the fuck use of the week, yay!

01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:58.500
The fuck use of the week, here, I usually explain to you, it's your turn.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.060
This is where we get ranty.

01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:03.840
Oh wait, this is just another part of the show.

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:08.300
This is where every week we take time to do a shout out to all those people that piss

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:15.720
us off and all the things that inconvenience us because we're better than everyone else.

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:16.720
That's about it.

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:21.640
So, um, because, again, I can't play music in the background, we're gonna go to a brief

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:27.840
break so all of you can PM me, yes, private message, or you can, um, email, uh, Orange

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:46.080
for you because we don't give a fuck. We're just going to go ahead and play some of our

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:51.720
We're not gonna play um, we're just gonna go ahead and play some of our usual fuck you theme songs and and

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:54.720
And then we'll come back and be Yanksti. So yeah.

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:23.000
We gotta do spill momentum

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.440
If you need the right tools and methods

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:26.520
Rise or waste, I can't be the winner of the market

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:28.280
If we can't get with the maintenance center

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:29.080
It all might fall

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.840
You can do it now, you're back to tango power

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.360
Yes already, take that ball

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:33.480
It's hard, you can't take it all

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:34.760
So drop the ball

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:37.960
Yeah, drop the ball

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.160
So drop the ball

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.280
Let me see that ball

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:50.200
Yeah, we gotta do spill momentum

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:51.640
If you need a right to a convention

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:53.140
Ride the wave and sometimes use the rhythm

01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:54.840
The march to the distance, we don't get with it

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:56.060
The rain is scintillating, all right

01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:58.040
If we're ready to do it now, you're like a tango flower

01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:59.440
We had to arrange to take that fall

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:01.440
And it's up to you to make that call

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.840
We drop the bomb

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.840
We drop the bomb

01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:12.340
We drop the bomb

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:56.340
I'm really bad

01:06:56.340 --> 01:07:02.340
I'm really bad

01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:04.340
Fuck you

01:07:34.340 --> 01:08:01.420
Well, um, that was our Music for Fuck You's of the Week.

01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:06.420
We'll go ahead and start with Loki for our angstyness.

01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:11.420
Alright. I'm so thrown off without music.

01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:16.420
No! Oh, God.

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:23.420
Uh, no, see, um, I really only have, I don't have, I think I had FUs earlier this week,

01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:27.420
but, like, I've just been bored over the weekend, so I kind of forgot it.

01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:29.420
Anyways, I have two.

01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:36.340
start off with the last angsty one. F you to acid 3.0 for constantly crashing on me

01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:40.580
and at least I'm smart enough to save every now and then, but the thing keeps freezing

01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:47.740
up on me and that sucks. So, yeah, F you to that. And F you to freaking stupid old people

01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:51.880
to handicap license plates, okay? Just because you're fucking crippled because you got shot

01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:56.180
in the ass in Vietnam or whatever, you don't need to be driving 30 miles an hour slower

01:08:56.180 --> 01:09:02.660
and everyone else and you take up the close parking spaces and you walk slow and you suck.

01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:06.980
So, you know, I think what should actually happen is because, you know, a lot of these

01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:10.860
people with handicapped bumper stickers, you know, I see, they're not hobbling enough.

01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:13.860
I just want to take, you know, their fucking wheelchair and just like, you know, go over

01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:17.900
the back of their spine with it, you know, just, you know, make sure that they're crippled

01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:22.220
just enough because it, what the hell, okay, if you're really crippled and you're driving

01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:29.000
a car? That's like driving a car blind. I mean, I don't know. I hate old people and

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.960
I hate them with the stupid, uh, yeah, stickers. No, I don't like the people who are not handicapped

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:40.160
and have handicapped stickers. Who just have them, or like borrow some family members just

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:45.160
so they can get a front parking spot. That would work. Anyway, is that your Fuck You

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:46.160
the week.

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:47.160
Okay.

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:51.340
Oh shit, they passed it to me.

01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:55.180
Alright, first of all, fuck you to everybody who's involved in like the mainstream hip

01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:56.680
hop community right now.

01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:00.260

01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:01.660
later as a goddamn remix.

01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:05.140
I don't care for where I carry single on it, it sucks dick anyway.

01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:39.060
brand out there.

01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:40.800
Fuck all you fascist bitches.

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:44.940
All the goddamn stupid-ass students at my fucking school will not listen to me when they're in class

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:31.260
people that want to close people

I don't like women with fake breasts. Oh, wait, I was married to one at one point, but

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:13.520
I don't like women with fake breasts.

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:20.520
It's like Anna Nicole Smith saying she has good taste in makeup.

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:26.380
I'd just like to say a massive fuck you to every single goddamn person who waits until

01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:32.680
the fucking last minute to buy their Sherry's Berries so that they can get something special

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:36.760
for their loved ones, and they wait until the day of

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:40.200
so that they can say, oh, can you deliver this for me today?

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:45.040
No, fuck you! We did everything through FedEx, you're too goddamn late,

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:48.520
go to the store and wait in line like everybody else. So fuck you people.

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:52.360
Eh.

01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:56.160
I don't really have any right now, I'm too happy and drunk.

01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:00.360
Hang on, we're seeing if Ross doesn't fuck you.

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.360

Got another fuck you fuck Sega for stopping making Dreamcast. I'm not buying another game from you

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.040
I'll be burning your shit on the internet happily

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:16.340
I will never pay for another Dreamcast game because you bastards didn't support the system kiss my ass

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:18.760
actually

01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:23.960
Sega would not be in existence if they continue to support the system. They would be bankrupt. I am not kidding you

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:29.520
They say they stopped producing the Dreamcast and stop supporting it so that they could stay alive as a company

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:39.520
We would not have any more Sonic Team games, we would not have any new Knights, no new Sonic, no nothing, if they hadn't stopped their production of the Dreamcast. I thought I would just let you know that.

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:41.520
Do you retract your fikey now?

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.520
Yes, yes I do. That still sucks though.

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:55.520
And F you to the stupid people on eBay, who I'm buying the freaking Mr. Science-ier 3000 movies for. Okay listen, I'm buying 46 movies for about, eh, it's going about $52 right now.

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:58.920
Stop emailing me, you people, that I'm not bidding on your auctions.

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:00.720
They're trying to sell me movies for $5 a piece.

01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:03.520
Listen, I'm buying taped movies because I can't...

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:06.620
I already own all the ones that are legit, okay?

01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:09.520
Don't try to sell me legit shit. I already own it.

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.620
Fuck you to you stupid-ass...

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:17.220
AIDS-infected, cocksucking motherfuckers who spam email people.

01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:21.720
I get sick of going to my goddamn account and having to delete 135 messages

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:27.040
because you guys can't stop telling me about ink cartridges and penis enlargement programs.

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:29.320
Look, if my dick was small, your wife wouldn't like it.

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:33.200
Quit fucking emailing me.

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:36.480
Just a side note on that one, does anybody ever notice that the females always get the

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:40.520
ones for the dick enlargements, and the women, or the guys always get the ones for the boob

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:41.520
enlargements?

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:42.520
Say motherfucking words.

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:43.520
Exactly.

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:47.080
I think I just deleted something out of my box today, it's all teal shark 39.

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:48.080
Enhance your penis naturally.

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:52.080
Wow, if I'm enhancing my penis, I've got a lot of issues right there.

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:59.080
I swear, there was one guy who actually did an interview where he stated that he was happy spamming because he got paid.

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:04.080
If I see you on the street, I'm going to stomp your motherfucking nut sack, and then I'm going to drop an elbow on your fucking nose and kill you.

01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:07.080
Darksack was in the bathroom and I'm going to give it to Loki.

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:11.080
And just so you know, spammers, I am happy with my breast size.

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:17.720
So, so stop sending me emails and like all the weird ones like they send you, you just

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:23.880
won this! You just won that! And as funny as I, all the um, all the websites I go on

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:29.840
to, I use different names, so like they'll send me like, hey Bob Bob, you just won da

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:34.040
da da! You know what you're gonna win if I find you? A fucking hatchet to the head! I'm

01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:38.440
sick of this, every five seconds, live nude girls getting fucked by horses in the ass

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:41.040
while they're being, you know, blown by a fucking seal.

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:42.400
I don't want to see this shit!

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:45.800
I'm going to do some kicky shit, but I'm not into live nude girls being fucked by horses.

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:48.840
Quit mailing me this shit in my email, I'll get sick of it, I've got to delete, like,

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:52.240
fifty messages. Want to see live nude girls? No! You want to see live nude girls!

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:57.120
You're a 400-pound man sitting off in a goddamn room who hasn't seen a fucking pussy ever since you were born!

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:59.560
Leave me the fuck alone!

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:02.640
I've got another F.U. and I think this is one that Rob would be proud of.

01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:04.740
I'd like to say a massive F.U. for

01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:08.700
that the whoever the associates were at Fox that decided to freaking get rid of

01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:09.540
Frenchy

01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:13.420
the only goddamn talent that they've ever had

01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:16.620
we can't have her on the show because

01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:21.420
American Idol has so much dignity and she worked on a porn site half of you are looking at it

01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:22.620
right now

01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:25.860
back to the spam thing

01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:29.980
the best spam I have ever received I actually kept hello

01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:33.060
if you are a time traveler I'm going to need the following

01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:40.060
One, a modified mind-warping dimensional warp generator number 524350A series wristwatch with memory adapter.

01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:45.060
Two, reliable carbon-based or silicon-based time-transducing capacitor.

01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:51.060
I need a reliable source. Please only reply if you're reliable. Send a separate email to me and gives an address.

01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:53.060
What the hell?

01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:56.060
Quit smoking crack and sending these emails to us.

01:16:56.060 --> 01:17:00.060
I don't need to know about ink cartridges. I don't need to know about every porn site that your mom's on.

01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:04.260
moms on. I don't need to know this shit, but yet every single time I hit my email account,

01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:07.340
whether it's my, you know, domain I paid for where I shouldn't have to suffer through this,

01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:11.300
or my little bullshit yahoo account, I get 135 messages of this. If I find out who's

01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:12.660
spam mailing me, they're going to die.

01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:17.380
I check my email about eight times a day because of so much spam that's in there, I have to

01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:22.580
go and clean it out because I have a limited mailbox that can have, you know, mail-in.

01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:26.360
But I have to say, I think I mentioned this a couple weeks back, the most creative email

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:30.180
I've ever gotten trying to get my personal information was they sent this email from

01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:37.080
an actual legit like Yahoo service in India, okay? And what it is, is it's saying, you

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:41.240
know, it's basically trying to get you to extort money for some person so they want

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:45.020
you to send their personal information instead of contact. It was the most elaborate email

01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:51.400
ever. I have it on my website but it was hilarious to read and they just wanted your personal

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:52.400
information.

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:57.400
Yeah, there's something I'm comfortable with. Sending out my personal information over the internet to somebody that I don't know.

01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:03.400
Oh yeah, fuck you to Japanese pornographers who put those fucking little mosaics over all the good stuff. I'm sick of that shit.

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:05.400
That's actually a law.

01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:06.400
It's stupid.

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:08.400
It's still a law, so they have to do it to sell their porn.

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:11.400
That's stupid. I want to Seattle her naked.

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:13.400
I can show you, um, Final Fuck X later.

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:15.400
Hahahaha.

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:18.400
Eishpika oishii.

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:19.400
She has porn.

01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:22.560
Okay, my turn.

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:26.160
Fuck you to alcohol for making me have to pee all the time.

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:28.160
Alcohol is your friend.

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:29.800
Fuck you again to the spammers.

01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:32.960
But see, I only have two active emails that I use.

01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:36.320
All the rest of my AOL names are blocked from the internet, but DarkSakura.com was left

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.320
open.

01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:43.700
I actually do have the site, but anyway, DarkSakura at AOL.com is now blocked from everybody except

01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:45.000
for the chosen few.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.120
Yes, the chosen few.

01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:51.120
Delete a few, and if you want to be among them, you can ask me, and I might say no.

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:55.120
Um, and I'm not telling you my other one, hell no.

01:18:55.120 --> 01:19:01.320
Um, but uh, my other one has to do with this stupid dumbass who walked out behind my car

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:02.320
today.

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.320
I nearly ran him over, and you know what?

01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:08.320
I wish I had, because the world would have been better without him in the gene pool.

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:13.880
Um, fuck you goes to...

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:18.080
He's like the little kid's pee or log floating in the gene pool.

01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:22.880
Yes, he is the feces of the gene pool.

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:28.360
My other fuck you of the week goes to my BeatMania 2DX controller.

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:32.340
Now normally when you have sticky keys on your 2DX controller, it's either going to

01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:35.680
be your first or your seventh key, am I right?

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:36.680
Typically.

01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:38.200
My sticky key is my fourth key!

01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:42.480
Yes, the top, middle, purple key, or blue, or whatever color it is.

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:43.480
It sticks!

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:49.340
Really makes it hard to try to pass our five because you have that one key. That's like the center key and

01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:55.100
and then I like come really close to passing a seven and then

01:19:56.020 --> 01:20:00.660

You realize that my fiance is a manager of GameStop

Yes, but Gamestop is one of those places that's not quite retail.

01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:04.580
Oh.

01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:06.580
I say not quite retail because it's not like Walmart or Target.

01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:08.580
It's a little bit smaller so you can get away with a little bit more.

01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:11.580
But I'll give him an exception. Dan's a cool guy. Shout out to Dan.

01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:15.580

He says he'll have to fuck you in a little bit. He's finishing up dinner.

Give me some more alcohol.

You want another Godiva?

01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:46.580
No. I want another Bacardi.

01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:48.580
Bacardi? Not Bacardi, but...

01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:49.580
Thingy.

01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:51.580
Um, okay.

01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:53.580
Fuck, um, the email box.

So guess what? Fuck yous are over.

01:22:55.580 --> 01:23:02.580
Okay, um, now what do we do? We've got all the angst out of our system.

Any suggestions? Damn, we have like an hour left, or an hour

and a half left. Uh, uh, the words aren't on the screen!

01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:18.260
People, come back! You're being awfully quiet, you're tired.

01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:24.260
Would you like to say something enlightening to the chat room?

01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:28.260
I really, really, really, really hate Sherry's Berries.

01:23:28.260 --> 01:23:43.320
You heard it here on Orange

01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:44.320
I'll alert the media. Oh wait, we are the media.

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:54.320
Well, that's like ice cream. It's Asian ice cream. Oh yeah.

01:23:54.320 --> 01:24:03.320
I think we should go to a break. Who agrees with me? Like, half of our people have already gone downstairs to watch the Ron Jeremy movie.

01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:08.560
There goes one of our hosts!

01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:13.800
We're going to an extended break, um, yeah, extended break.

01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:17.380
Some of us have to pee too, um, except I already went.

01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:18.380
You didn't need to know that.

01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:21.760
God, now I'm in here by myself, jeez!

01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:22.760
Okay.

01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:25.520
Yeah, well, fuck you!

01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:55.900
Identify new stations where my vocals heard

Count the total verbs, be flippin' at the lower words

01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:00.900
My destiny, set for day to leave, forget Maybelline

01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:03.900
I got no maybes, running my shows in your nose without

01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:05.900
Anti-histamine, I'm in the future

01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:07.900
MCs who misdemean as left to be

01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:12.900
I represent a different map, hip-hop diplomat

01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:13.900

Be right, be ya, I'm original flowjack

01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:17.780
No flow jack, God glorify it

01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:20.240
Poor spiritual elitist frat remain anonymous

01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:21.900
Maleficent, pick astronomer

01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:24.240
Ear tight apparel, third commandment for idolatry

01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:26.780
Cause tomorrow won't go so soon

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:29.440
I gotta get through to you

01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:31.840
Cause tomorrow won't go so soon

01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:34.140
I don't wanna make that move

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:37.300
Cause tomorrow won't go so soon

01:27:37.380 --> 01:27:39.500
It's nothin' I got to do

01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:42.300
Cause tomorrow won't go so soon

01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:44.800
I gotta get through you

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:49.800
I've been wondering what's written into me

01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:54.800
Those sweet words are hard to believe

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:59.800
Stop playing games and let me let you know

01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:02.800
It ain't just what you show, but why you'd show this

01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:04.800
This world will flow like there's no tomorrow

01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:07.800
I constellate any track with verbiage I extract

01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:09.800
Expect the less for max, we bomb the cats, we dump

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:10.800
We just feel this, I contract

01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:12.800
I commit the act of subtraction, I whack one

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:15.360
Black one, even snatch crumbs are financially bad munch

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:17.360
You be messin' with the rare specimen

01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:18.760
Whose vision is invagin'?

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:20.480
Just catch you wankin' the tangent off the track

01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:21.440
Will I be ever changin'?

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:23.680
You wonder where all these thoughts come from

01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:25.680
Verbal, the mind-toucher, I fell under you like

01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:27.680
Python as a mama, like it was vomit

01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:29.680
Pro-feasly, hard on the language, not excuse me

01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:31.440
As an anthem, I'll archive it, choose thee

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:32.960
Left face, but wish to carry out

01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:34.240
Whether by land or aerial

01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:35.840
Cuz, this kid cannot be stereo

01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:37.280
Talk out more brothers than burial

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:39.440
Right for harvest, you jacklin', not a novice

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:41.760
Caught as a hip-hop fan blowin' up A&C

01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:46.760
I ain't your average artist, my thought is Look into God's direction and I can guard it, sis

01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:51.760
We all look and see who's in reality

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:56.760
Believe and care will set you free, yeah

01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:59.760
I need a change on your mind

01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:01.760
Two parts and three divides

01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:04.760
Do it, let's give it here

01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:07.760
So I'll call you now

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:09.760

01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:19.760
Tomorrow won't go to school

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:21.760
It's not that I've got to do

01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:24.760
Tomorrow won't go to school

01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:27.760

No one represents the meteorites

01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:36.760
No proof, know what I'm saying?

01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:40.260
Yo, right around now DJ Hoori's in the mix

01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:42.260

Yo, ni senju ni nen no soundo sakura

You know what I'm saying?

01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:49.800
Yo, and it goes a little something like this y'all

01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:32.760
Kowashite mia oshite waka akeru no ni

01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:38.260
Sole ga asashi no go ikakurakara

01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:10.260
Oh

01:33:08.260 --> 01:33:15.260

01:33:15.260 --> 01:33:21.260
I'll never forget you

01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:32.260
I'll never forget you

01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:37.900
Yeah, she's the last one

01:34:02.260 --> 01:34:04.260
You

01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:33.260
You don't need another one

01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:43.460
You don't need another one

01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:43.960
Yes!

01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:15.460
Oh

And there's another you and I hell

01:36:48.460 --> 01:36:52.460
Here comes another one

01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:56.460
You've got to get another one

01:37:26.460 --> 01:37:38.800
We're back live. That was a series of long versions. The first one that we had was M-Flow

01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:44.440
with Flowjack, Mr. Junk Remix. Next was Judy and Mary with Sobekasu, which, yeah, the English

01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:49.460
version was in DDR. And then Gacked with Another World, a song that made it into Guitar Freaks

01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:51.460
I'M ON JACK'S PARTY!

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:24.600
stated the fact that everybody in the porn industry has a case of herpes, and, you know,

01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:28.300
you may be looking at Jenna Jameson or Asia Carrera at home, but you have to consider

01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:31.580
the fact that they might have, like, more diseases than Anna Nicole Smith has lawsuits

01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:35.060
over that old guy, so it's kind of scary.

01:38:35.060 --> 01:38:39.300
Actually, Ron, Jeremy said that he's only come down with, what was it, the crabs and

01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:43.060
something else one time, but that was before he got in the industry. He's been 21 years

01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:44.700
in the industry and he's been clean the whole time.

01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:49.340
Wow, he must have been getting some decent chicks in. I mean, I'd be sca- I mean, you

01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:52.900
know, you think about it, like, you hear about, like, gangbangs and stuff, uh, who's the last-

01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:57.300
Jasmine St. Clair and there was some other chick, Houston, I think her name was? They

01:38:57.300 --> 01:39:02.500
go through, like, 500 guys! That's scary! You'd have to back a rider truck into that

01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:10.500
to catch a feeling. That's, like, ugh! Yeah, the world record gangbang things. That's

01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:13.160
crazy

01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:14.900
something fun

01:39:14.900 --> 01:39:18.420
do you catch feelings in that and you have like walk back and forth between

01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:20.280
the walls already catch anything

01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:23.420
and let's not get twisted if a girl goes out sleeps with a bunch of guys that

01:39:23.420 --> 01:39:26.380
does not necessarily makers like you know uh...

01:39:26.380 --> 01:39:29.680
i'm not i'm not at all for the double standard

01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:33.000
you know guys go out to the bunch of women and they're considered studs for

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.220
it or that it's ok

01:39:34.220 --> 01:39:37.460
goes on to the budget doesn't consider slots that stupid if you don't have a

01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:39.700
protected sex with a bunch of guys

01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:42.640
that's one thing but if you're going out and you're being healthy about it i mean hey that's

01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:45.620
that's your decision and you know

01:39:45.620 --> 01:39:51.820
exactly it doesn't make you a slut makes you horny

01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:55.460
we need more of that we need more women who are open about that sort of thing to

01:39:55.460 --> 01:39:58.900
actually get out there and talk to guys and you know completely shatter that

01:39:58.900 --> 01:40:00.360
whole stereotype

01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:02.980
because i think it would make things a lot easier on guys plus you'd let them

01:40:02.980 --> 01:40:06.800
know if they were in the friend zone a lot easier and that would help

01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:12.160
nothing's hotter than a woman coming out here

01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:15.000
i'm convinced that we're going to get any guys they want to if they just came

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:18.600
on the more guys but what is released all of the time while uh...

01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:22.180
dark soccer comes up with something she's right now a few things right now

01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:25.820

01:41:06.220 --> 01:41:07.620
I don't know about that one.

01:41:07.620 --> 01:41:09.380

because he could get head while playing Metroid

01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:14.320
uh...

01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:26.320
He liked him because Ron Jeremy could have sex with many anonymous women at the same time.

01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:31.320
Pleasing with his nine and three-quarter inch cock.

Actor came out of the mouth of the woman that he was having sex with because his penis was so big

rodgermy can suck his own cock

01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:11.640

01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:18.640

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:23.880

01:52:18.980 --> 01:52:21.080
Evilenaki2DX has left our chat room.

01:52:21.780 --> 01:52:22.780
I just noticed.

01:52:22.780 --> 01:52:27.820
Are we going to be able to find another contestant in the interim?

01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:31.040
Who wants to take Naoki's place, or should we wait?

01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:32.160
I don't know, chat room.

01:52:32.740 --> 01:52:33.960
Guys, should we wait for Naoki?

01:52:34.420 --> 01:52:36.340
Can we give him a few minutes?

01:52:36.340 --> 01:52:40.640
We'll go ahead and take another break.

01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:45.720
We'll give him a few minutes to show up, and if he doesn't show

01:52:45.720 --> 01:52:49.120
up then we'll have to find a replacement.

01:52:49.120 --> 01:52:53.680
I'm probably in the interest of fairness we'll have to go ahead and set this

01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:59.800
point aside so we'll go ahead and play a song or two just to give us some time.

01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:07.360
That's fair, right? One song. We'll go ahead and pick a song so I'll play a...

01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:08.820

Perry the Perfect Attacker wanted to enter the Perfect Attack Tournament because he didn't.

01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:09.720

01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:12.720
Um, we'll go ahead to EOSFB.

01:59:13.720 --> 01:59:16.720
His penis wasn't as big as Ron Jeremy's.

01:59:17.720 --> 01:59:19.720
What does that have to do with PA? We'll never know.

01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:21.720
Stop talking about Ron Jeremy, man!

01:59:22.720 --> 01:59:25.720
Dirk Tetsi says, because he was watching porn.

01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:27.720
Okay.

01:59:28.720 --> 01:59:30.720
My answer. My answer.

01:59:31.720 --> 01:59:34.720
Because Tigger already entered it, and he would have won anyway.

01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:41.720
because it doesn't matter because if tinker enters you're gonna lose so go home and sleep

01:59:41.720 --> 01:59:45.080
yeah

01:59:45.080 --> 01:59:52.720
i said because he was too busy fapping to anna or hora prawn she has a really nice ass

01:59:52.720 --> 01:59:57.080
i said because what did i say because he was watching ron jeremy give himself head

01:59:57.080 --> 02:00:02.360
both of those involve watching porn right

02:00:02.360 --> 02:00:10.360
He gets a half point for each of those, so yeah, D'artecia is ahead by one point.

02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:17.360
Okay, next question.

02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:23.360
For his birthday, Loki asks for a bowl of ice cream and blank.

02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:30.360
For his birthday, Loki asked for a bowl of ice cream and blank.

02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:32.360
Okay, we have answers. So let's go ahead and go to our contestants. Okay? Back to the question.

02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:36.360
PerryThePerfectAttacker wants to enter...no, that's the wrong one. My bad.

02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:39.360
ForestBorthdayLoki asked for a bowl of ice cream and blank.

02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:43.360
EOSFB said, Run Jeremy Porn!

02:01:43.360 --> 02:01:46.360
Stop saying that!

02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:51.360
Fucking A! Stop talking about Run Jeremy! It sure isn't about him!

02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:56.360
Um, Dark Testia says, Asian Midget Porn!

02:01:56.360 --> 02:01:59.360
The fuck would I want? Asian Midget Porn!

02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:02.360
They actually have Asian midgets? That's what I want to know, man.

02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:05.360
How tall do they stand?

02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:07.360
Two feet three.

02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:10.360
Okay.

02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:15.360
For his birthday, Loki asked for a bowl of ice cream and a license to kill idiots.

02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:18.360
That's a close second.

02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:30.360
Mine was, okay, a giant harem full of young Asian schoolgirls, naked and horny, with whipped cream, lots of whipped cream.

02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:40.360
Actually, you know, now that I meant, yeah, Asian schoolgirls naked. And, cause I can't, you know, obviously I'm seeing someone, but you know, it's a gift, and it'd be wrong for me to refuse a gift.

02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:41.360
He's a gift.

02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:47.320
Man, if you don't need all those schoolgirls, donate to the fucking Chinese schoolgirls

02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:48.960
fund for real.

02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:51.740
But I was gonna say a sweet transvestite from Transylvania...

02:02:51.740 --> 02:02:53.400
BROTHER DICKIN' EATS!

02:02:53.400 --> 02:02:55.400
But uh, anyway.

02:02:55.400 --> 02:02:58.640
No, not Rob.

02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:01.080
We never know.

02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:04.200
My answer was increased breast-fies from those spammers.

02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:08.360
And increased penis-size!

02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:11.520
I'm sorry, we don't have a match.

02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:15.180
No match for you!

02:03:15.180 --> 02:03:16.340
Yeah.

02:03:16.340 --> 02:03:17.800
You are a loser.

02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:20.720
Okay, last question.

02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:27.560
After playing seven games of DDR, Darla the Dancer decided to go rest by blank.

02:03:27.560 --> 02:03:31.000
Send in your answer.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.300
Throttle of his hands are decided to rest by a blank.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:30.520
Alright, we're back!

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:37.500
Okay, after seven games of DDR, Darla the Dancer decided to go rest by blank.

02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:43.000
EOSFB said, rest by a cherry tree- er, I mean, Ron Jeremy's penis.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:48.000
Uh, Dark Tetsuya said, masturbating with a bottle of Propel.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
What the fuck?

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:54.000
How the hell do you masturbate with a bottle of Propel?

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Here, maybe Joe can explain this to you.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:00.000
How in the hell do you masturbate with a bottle of Propel?

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Can you answer this from experience? Mind telling us about it?

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:12.000
Now, bottle of balls, that's different because it's kind of, you know, ribbed on the outside, so I assume that women might like that, you know.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
You sound like you say this from experience.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:22.000
That's a little bit disturbing, but you could probably fit it inside of like, you know, like Anna Nicole Smith's vagina, I guess, maybe.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
Don't get me started on the stories I've heard before.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
Such as?

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
My mom's a nurse, I've heard stories.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:31.200
okay we're story

02:05:31.200 --> 02:05:32.400
yeah i'll save it

02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:34.680
okay she's gonna save them i want to hear this

02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:37.640
what's in their vagina

02:05:37.640 --> 02:05:41.960
okay we'll save that for right after the match game how does that is that fair

02:05:41.960 --> 02:05:45.160
my answer was

02:05:45.160 --> 02:05:51.440
after playing seven games of ddr darla the dancer decided to go rest by

02:05:51.440 --> 02:05:53.280
just propel

02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:54.880
your answer

02:05:54.880 --> 02:06:00.300
Well, rest by? Are you talking about like an actual physical object that she's resting by?

02:06:00.300 --> 02:06:02.020
Just propel.

02:06:02.020 --> 02:06:02.860
Okay, well anyways,

02:06:02.860 --> 02:06:09.260
I was gonna say, uh, Darla the Dancer decided to go rest by watching Ron Jeremy suck his own penis.

02:06:09.260 --> 02:06:12.660
Since obviously that was every fucking other answer!

02:06:12.660 --> 02:06:16.860
Ugh.

02:06:16.860 --> 02:06:19.380
Uh, Darla went to go rest, um,

02:06:19.380 --> 02:06:23.460
by watching one of my ninja school girls practice because I have ninja school

02:06:23.460 --> 02:06:26.560
girls and they are kick-ass

02:06:26.560 --> 02:06:33.560
I decided she was going to rest by blowing up Roseville Golf Land

02:06:34.080 --> 02:06:38.160
I want this movie that has ninja school girls. Ninja school girls are cool

02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:41.520
Dude, blowing up Roseville Golf Land sounds like my idea of restful

02:06:41.520 --> 02:06:42.820
That actually sounds exciting

02:06:42.820 --> 02:06:46.640
Okay, so Dark Tetsuya gets half a point, EOSFP gets half a point

02:06:46.640 --> 02:06:47.660
Which means that

02:06:47.660 --> 02:06:54.660
Dartis is our winner! Yay!

02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:57.820
You win a bloody anus!

02:06:57.820 --> 02:07:01.180
Here on Orange Loves Radio!

02:07:01.180 --> 02:07:03.920
Um, so, Melody, you wanna tell us about the

02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:09.140
about the segment, what stuck up the vagina?

02:07:09.140 --> 02:07:12.860
It, it actually wouldn't be a vagina unless spammers have actually come up with, um,

02:07:12.860 --> 02:07:14.700
how to grow a new vagina

02:07:14.700 --> 02:07:16.780
instead of, like, increased breast size.

02:07:16.780 --> 02:07:20.580
Now, my mom told me once she heard a story from an x-ray tech

02:07:20.580 --> 02:07:23.300
where this guy was complaining that, um,

02:07:23.300 --> 02:07:26.300
I don't remember what his complaint was, but they needed to do x-rays.

02:07:26.300 --> 02:07:27.740
So, um,

02:07:27.740 --> 02:07:28.580
x-ray tech

02:07:28.580 --> 02:07:31.700
took him into the x-ray room and positioned him and everything, and

02:07:31.700 --> 02:07:34.940
she turns out the light, because you have to turn out the light to take an x-ray, well, there was

02:07:34.940 --> 02:07:37.740
still light in the room.

02:07:37.740 --> 02:07:40.820
She can't figure it out until she realized the light was coming from the

02:07:40.820 --> 02:07:43.100
guy's ass.

02:07:43.100 --> 02:07:50.100
because he had inserted a flashlight and it had turned itself on.

02:07:50.980 --> 02:07:55.400
I can understand if you know you're a little bit kinky and

02:07:55.400 --> 02:08:00.740
you know, there's nothing wrong with anal sex, that's your thing, you know, go ahead and do it as long as you're careful.

02:08:00.740 --> 02:08:03.760
But there are just some things that shouldn't go in your ass and I'm pretty sure

02:08:03.760 --> 02:08:05.860
flashlights, cell phones are one,

02:08:05.860 --> 02:08:11.680
but I'm pretty sure flashlights are up there in the top five. Barbie dolls or others, hamsters, no.

02:08:11.680 --> 02:08:16.680
You know, but th- th- th- th- no, okay? Just- just flashlights, don't play that game.

02:08:18.480 --> 02:08:21.380
And Dami's doing something on the computer, I'm trying to hand her back the mic.

02:08:21.380 --> 02:08:23.780
You're watching- you're listening to Orange Lounge right now.

02:08:24.380 --> 02:08:27.280
Um, we're talking about things that are stuck in people's asses.

02:08:27.280 --> 02:08:32.680
I actually heard a story at San Francisco General Hospital about a guy who came in

02:08:33.580 --> 02:08:36.080
and supposedly had shoved a cucumber into his rectum.

02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:39.280
When asked by the doctors how it got there, he said he fell on it.

02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:45.280
I'm no rocket scientist or anything, but you don't just fall on a cucumber, you know?

02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:46.280
Wait, hang on, Melly.

02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:50.280
My question is, why are you naked and falling on a cucumber in the first place?

02:08:50.280 --> 02:08:57.280
I do that every day, you know, I go home at random and I just grease up a Crisco, a cucumber with Crisco.

02:08:57.280 --> 02:09:04.280
I just fall on that motherfucker because I feel like it fucking Johnny Knox would want to be a motherfucker.

02:09:04.280 --> 02:09:07.280
I think we should introduce a new segment on the show, by the way.

02:09:07.280 --> 02:09:13.120
The Darwin Awards Segment I'm going to read some information off of

02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:15.200
the Darwin Awards News Stories

02:09:15.200 --> 02:09:25.480
We're going to read one called Midnight Snack 23rd October 2002 Australia

02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:28.520
What besides beer is Australia's most recognizable symbol?

02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:32.520
Saltwater crocodiles, of course, popularized by crocodile hunter Steve Irwin

02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:35.520
What is the most natural tourist activity?

02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:38.500
Try viewing these amazing beauties in their natural habitat.

02:09:38.500 --> 02:09:43.780
Tours from around the world visit the wild places of Australia, so open water is routinely

02:09:43.780 --> 02:09:47.920
posted with graphic warning signs to let people know that swimming with these dinosaur-like

02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:49.820
carnivores is not a good idea.

02:09:49.820 --> 02:09:53.300
The sign typically shows a human figure between the jaws of a salty.

02:09:53.300 --> 02:09:57.540
The blunt graphic has proven so effective enough that there have been no crocodile-related

02:09:57.540 --> 02:10:01.820
deaths in the Northern Territory since 1998, at least not until now.

02:10:01.820 --> 02:10:05.820
Perhaps it was the full moon, or the warmth of the evening, that convinced a young German

02:10:05.820 --> 02:10:07.780
woman to go for a midnight swim.

02:10:07.780 --> 02:10:11.860
As usual, the billabong was clearly posted with toothy danger signs.

02:10:11.860 --> 02:10:15.060
The woman, a short-lived member of an adventure tour group, was about to get more adventure

02:10:15.060 --> 02:10:17.220
than is generally advertised.

02:10:17.220 --> 02:10:20.940
Police commander Max Pope stated, the warm night, the full moon, the billabong looked

02:10:20.940 --> 02:10:21.940
idyllic.

02:10:21.940 --> 02:10:24.940
But danger, in the form of a twelve-foot seltie, lurched beneath the tranquility.

02:10:24.940 --> 02:10:28.000
The next morning, the crocodile was located, still holding the deceased.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:29.500
It was harpooned by wildlife officers.

02:10:29.500 --> 02:10:35.500
For both Woman and Crocodile, the idyllic days of summer ended with a midnight snack.

02:10:35.500 --> 02:10:38.500
How's that for stupid?

02:10:38.500 --> 02:10:43.500
That's not that bad. I mean, I've seen... I've heard worse.

02:10:43.500 --> 02:10:47.500
There was a funny one about some guy that, like, fell over a cliff, or the...

02:10:47.500 --> 02:10:50.500
Something about, like, um...

02:10:50.500 --> 02:10:58.500
I don't know, it had to do with some guy in a tree or something, and then there was a truck on a cliff or something, and they backed it up and ran over the guy in the tree, and...

02:10:58.500 --> 02:11:03.500
I got a Darwin award. Puff Daddy thought he could come up with something fucking original. There's your Darwin.

02:11:03.500 --> 02:11:05.500
Here's another one.

02:11:05.500 --> 02:11:07.500
November 2002, The Netherlands.

02:11:07.500 --> 02:11:11.500
A retired engineer booby-trapped his home with the intention of killing his estranged family,

02:11:11.500 --> 02:11:14.500
but died himself after inadvertently triggering one of his own devices.

02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:20.500
At first, police assumed the 79-year-old had committed suicide, as he was found alone with a bullet wound in the neck.

02:11:20.500 --> 02:11:25.500
Then, a detective missed a bullet by inches when he opened a booby-trapped wooden chest.

02:11:25.500 --> 02:11:28.660
This beat a hasty retreat from the property and called in military experts.

02:11:28.660 --> 02:11:33.340
They deciphered an enigmatic series of scribbled clues to locate nineteen death traps in walls,

02:11:33.340 --> 02:11:35.060
ceilings, and household objects.

02:11:35.060 --> 02:11:40.220
A pile of booby-trap dinner plates was revealed by the clue, cheaper by the dozen, a reference

02:11:40.220 --> 02:11:43.060
to a film in which a child throws a plate at someone's head.

02:11:43.060 --> 02:11:46.900
Please speculate that the notes were intended to assist his failing memory.

02:11:46.900 --> 02:11:51.740
Other traps included numerous concealed shotguns triggered by threads, and an exploding crate

02:11:51.740 --> 02:11:56.220
beer set to detonate once a certain number of bottles were removed.

02:11:56.220 --> 02:11:59.180
It took three weeks to crack nineteen of the twenty clues, and

02:11:59.180 --> 02:12:01.580
the experts were forced to admit defeat on the final note.

02:12:01.580 --> 02:12:04.700
The twelve apostles are ready to work on the pebbles," said one.

02:12:04.700 --> 02:12:06.900
We have never come across anything like it before.

02:12:06.900 --> 02:12:08.220
It was all fiendishly clever.

02:12:08.220 --> 02:12:11.660
True to form, the fiendishly clever but careless Darwin award winner was

02:12:11.660 --> 02:12:15.260
described by neighbors as a tactically harmless man who employed puttering

02:12:15.260 --> 02:12:16.260
in his garage.

02:12:16.260 --> 02:12:18.540
But relatives say he never forgave his wife for

02:12:18.540 --> 02:12:20.980
deforcing him twenty years before.

02:12:20.980 --> 02:12:24.200
Police believe he began installing the traps for four years after losing a lengthy battle

02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:25.820
to keep his home.

02:12:25.820 --> 02:12:30.980
Although some may argue that fourteen children in his advanced age rule out of Darwin award,

02:12:30.980 --> 02:12:35.880
the judges feel the magnitude of his actions overcome by these practical concerns.

02:12:35.880 --> 02:12:37.660
That one was cool.

02:12:37.660 --> 02:12:45.620
Booby trapping your home with twenty traps intended to kill your family.

02:12:45.620 --> 02:12:47.500
The cord was stuck.

02:12:47.500 --> 02:12:53.680
It's not quite along that line, but I have an actual true-to-life, my own family story.

02:12:53.680 --> 02:12:59.380
My great-uncle was in World War I or II, I can't remember which, I don't think I ever

02:12:59.380 --> 02:13:04.320
really knew, and he lives in the Midwest in Missouri, and he passed away recently, and

02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:07.460
my aunt and uncle moved into his house, and they were going through some of his stuff

02:13:07.460 --> 02:13:12.940
in his basement and found a bunch of his World War I Rema Rebelia, and they found a hand

02:13:12.940 --> 02:13:13.940
grenade.

02:13:13.940 --> 02:13:18.260
Now, they're like, okay, this is interesting, so they call the St. Justice Police, who have

02:13:18.260 --> 02:13:19.700
no bomb squad, because

02:13:19.700 --> 02:13:23.100
it's not a small town, but it's not exactly huge, so they have to call Kansas City.

02:13:23.100 --> 02:13:26.700
Well, Kansas City, of course, has bomb squads, but they can't really do anything about it,

02:13:26.700 --> 02:13:27.660
because it's a good

02:13:27.660 --> 02:13:30.620
hour's drive away. So,

02:13:30.620 --> 02:13:35.540
Kansas City says, okay, call Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, for help.

02:13:35.540 --> 02:13:38.580
They call Fort Leavenworth. The first thing

02:13:38.580 --> 02:13:41.980
that Fort Leavenworth says is, okay, well, where is the hand grenade?

02:13:41.980 --> 02:13:45.140
and they're like it's right next to us

02:13:45.140 --> 02:13:48.620
the first thing they say is get out of the house this

02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:52.420
instant don't hang up the phone and leave because apparently

02:13:52.420 --> 02:13:56.100
these grenades when they're this old have a tendency to go off

02:13:56.100 --> 02:13:59.900
on their own just from being handled my uncle was tossing the damn thing in the

02:13:59.900 --> 02:14:00.980
air at the time

02:14:00.980 --> 02:14:04.100
he was like freaking juggling the hand grenade

02:14:04.100 --> 02:14:07.220
Fort Leavenworth drove out to my uncle's

02:14:07.220 --> 02:14:10.740
old house, got the grenade, put it in a brom proof box

02:14:10.740 --> 02:14:17.740
Duct tape that blocks to all freakin' hell and had to take it back to the base to be exploded.

02:14:17.740 --> 02:14:22.740
Because remember folks, duct tape prevents explosions.

02:14:22.740 --> 02:14:26.740
And apparently it's good for acne or something. I don't know.

02:14:26.740 --> 02:14:29.740
It's stupid as all hell.

02:14:29.740 --> 02:14:33.740
And my uncle is stupid as all hell because yeah, he's just in here doo-doo-doo-doo.

02:14:33.740 --> 02:14:38.740
Here's the ingrenade to think I'll toss it in the air.

02:14:38.740 --> 02:14:44.580
I think on that note we need to go to a break in this break for the sake of

02:14:44.940 --> 02:14:48.400
Gumby who is in our chat room and hopefully listening to the show

02:14:50.060 --> 02:14:53.180
We are going to play a song just for you

02:14:54.660 --> 02:14:58.260
We are going to play bumblebee skies voice remix

02:14:59.980 --> 02:15:04.580
And we are going to play some random other stuff maybe

02:15:04.580 --> 02:15:11.780
a quick master from pop and music and some other random stuff this is from one

02:15:11.780 --> 02:15:20.120
of this is from one of Rob's of fuck-off shows so here goes okay I guess we're

02:15:20.120 --> 02:15:23.800
gonna do one more because I got these much better parody lyrics for bumblebee

02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:27.720
than that shit I did a little bit ago so we're gonna do this one instead this

02:15:27.720 --> 02:15:34.720
comes from DVR Angel and Stressa. This is much better, so enjoy.

02:15:57.720 --> 02:15:58.720
Fantasy

02:16:03.720 --> 02:16:06.720
My foot kicks your ass when you walk in the room

02:16:06.720 --> 02:16:09.720
I go boom, boom, boom, you go zoom, zoom, zoom

02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:13.720
You're my poor, mad, dead, bad, killable friend

02:16:13.720 --> 02:16:17.720
I wanna kick your ass until you're dead

02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:20.720
I'll shove my foot right up your ass

02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:24.720
To help you see it's true

02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:27.720
I don't like you, can't you see?

02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:30.720
Now get the fuck away from me!

02:16:31.720 --> 02:16:34.720
Sweet little Bumblebee, get the fuck away from me!

02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:41.720
Sweet little bumblebee, just a funky panache

02:16:41.720 --> 02:16:59.720
Sweet little bumblebee, just a funky panache

02:16:59.720 --> 02:17:01.720
Fuck you.

02:17:29.720 --> 02:17:31.720
Oh

02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:35.720
This is the end of the video, if you want to see more videos like this, please subscribe to my channel.

02:21:35.720 --> 02:21:52.040
See you in the later part!

02:21:52.040 --> 02:21:56.440
This just sounds This just sounds

02:21:56.440 --> 02:22:16.080
This is the way we dance, this is the way we rock, this is the way we vibe, as we demonstrate,

02:22:16.080 --> 02:22:17.780
As we demonstrate

02:22:17.780 --> 02:22:19.680
Everybody wants a piece of the pie

02:22:19.680 --> 02:22:21.180
Bose, Amina, Mr. I

02:22:21.180 --> 02:22:22.980
Cause the rules are like having the idol in the fight

02:22:22.980 --> 02:22:24.980
Cause I spy, he makes fly

02:22:24.980 --> 02:22:26.380
This is the way we dance

02:22:26.380 --> 02:22:27.680
This is the way we rock

02:22:27.680 --> 02:22:29.080
This is the way we ride

02:22:29.080 --> 02:22:30.380
As we demonstrate

02:22:30.380 --> 02:22:32.380
I'll show you them a straight

02:22:49.180 --> 02:22:51.180
This just sounds

02:22:51.820 --> 02:22:53.820
This just sounds

02:22:53.820 --> 02:22:55.580
Everybody wants a piece of you in the pie

02:22:55.580 --> 02:22:57.180
Paws on me like Mr. I

02:22:57.180 --> 02:22:59.180
Paws on me like I'm the guy doing the fight

02:23:29.180 --> 02:23:39.180
I'm sorry, that was dead air. My apologies. We're live again. Hey, let's do a quick promo.

02:23:39.180 --> 02:23:49.380
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio. Yay! Yay! Okay. Damn, we got 30 more minutes to go. Let's

02:23:49.380 --> 02:23:56.140
go back to our favorite segment. Ask Orange Lounge. Because we can't think of other shit

02:23:56.140 --> 02:23:57.140
to do.

02:23:57.140 --> 02:23:58.140
Yay!

02:23:58.140 --> 02:24:04.700
I have real audio, but I can't find anything without hurting the stream.

02:24:04.700 --> 02:24:05.700
Sorry.

02:24:05.700 --> 02:24:09.020
Everyone, send us questions.

02:24:09.020 --> 02:24:12.260
We'll send you answers.

02:24:12.260 --> 02:24:17.700
In the interim, I'll go ahead, I used a big word, I wonder if they can understand that.

02:24:17.700 --> 02:24:18.700
No.

02:24:18.700 --> 02:24:21.740
Well, I have some, but not like I can play them on here.

02:24:21.740 --> 02:24:25.220
Once we get about four questions up, then I'll go ahead and come back.

02:24:25.220 --> 02:24:30.180
right now. You see, this is the song that I've been wanting us to play, um, during our

02:24:30.180 --> 02:24:35.680
little, um, questions, and I dedicate this particular song to the dearly departed Oolong

02:24:35.680 --> 02:24:40.780
the Bunny. We're going to cosplay Oolong the Bunny, aren't we?

02:24:40.780 --> 02:24:44.320
I guess that's the plan, yep. That'd be fun.

02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:47.780
I have costumes sort of designed. I'll have to draw it out for you. It's really cool.

02:24:47.780 --> 02:24:51.780
I've got more plans. There's the pancake movie you can do.

02:24:51.780 --> 02:24:55.780
I have to make leg warmers and I know how to do it.

02:24:55.780 --> 02:24:59.780
You have to have the leg warmers and the bunny feet, but I know how to make bunny feet.

02:24:59.780 --> 02:25:03.780
I know how to make bunny feet that fit over shoes.

02:25:03.780 --> 02:25:07.780
All this bunny feet and leg warmer stuff has got me scared, okay? I just wanted ears and a pancake.

02:25:07.780 --> 02:25:11.780
That's it. Ears, pancake, nothing else.

02:25:11.780 --> 02:25:15.780
And this one's for Rob. I want sleep.

02:25:15.780 --> 02:25:19.780
Or a pancake.

02:25:19.780 --> 02:25:21.780
Keep in mind, I am a cosplayer.

02:25:22.780 --> 02:25:26.780
Okay, anyway, we're gonna wait till we get a few more answers in.

02:25:26.780 --> 02:25:32.780
So in the meantime, this is the song that we wanted to have for our Ask Orange Challenge.

02:25:32.780 --> 02:25:39.780
the rabbits with Usaokun from Keyboard Mania.

02:26:32.780 --> 02:26:36.780
Shonbori Usopu

02:26:39.780 --> 02:26:43.780
Mibibori Usopu

02:26:46.780 --> 02:26:50.780
Suso lando de wa

02:26:50.780 --> 02:26:53.780
Inanaka Yoshi

02:26:53.780 --> 02:26:57.780
Koro mo ashi ita mo mata

02:26:57.780 --> 02:27:17.620
We're back, we're live, and our first question comes from 23rd Vegas, it said, what would

02:27:17.620 --> 02:27:23.340
I do with a video of Ron Jeremy and two kawaii Japanese girls in a bucket of chocolate ready

02:27:23.340 --> 02:27:24.340
whip?

02:27:24.340 --> 02:27:27.580
I would go watch the video of Ron Jeremy.

02:27:27.580 --> 02:27:33.960
I would send the two kawaii Japanese school girls to go buy me some booze.

02:27:33.960 --> 02:27:36.900
And I would eat the bucket of chocolate ready whip.

02:27:36.900 --> 02:27:40.260
Did Ulo the Bunny taste like chicken or pancakes?

02:27:40.260 --> 02:27:42.880
He tasted like rabbit.

02:27:42.880 --> 02:27:47.220
And from Dark Tetsuya, who is the most drunk?

02:27:47.220 --> 02:27:51.060
I don't think you're drunk enough yet.

02:27:51.060 --> 02:27:55.140
fall down the stairs

02:27:55.140 --> 02:27:58.260
K, that fell over. I need to pick that up.

02:27:58.260 --> 02:28:01.740
Don't stare at her. You don't have to.

02:28:01.740 --> 02:28:05.060
No, don't clean my house! Oh, thank you.

02:28:05.060 --> 02:28:08.820
Dude, Loki's cleaning my house. That's cool.

02:28:08.820 --> 02:28:13.420
So, do you do windows?

02:28:13.420 --> 02:28:17.460
I don't do windows.

02:28:17.460 --> 02:28:25.600
what do I do windows don't ask me I've got the Mac my pretty little power book

02:28:25.600 --> 02:28:39.700

02:28:50.980 --> 02:28:58.100
so we're gonna do something else hey we have time for listless don't we all

02:28:58.100 --> 02:29:00.900

02:29:00.900 --> 02:29:13.180

02:29:13.180 --> 02:29:19.340
list we're going to do favorite alcohol for any reason whatsoever

02:29:19.340 --> 02:29:23.980
here on Orange House radio in the meantime we'll go ahead and play more

02:29:23.980 --> 02:29:29.260
music I think I have something I don't have some we have more questions is there

02:29:29.260 --> 02:29:32.620
this week no because I'm not here next question

02:29:32.620 --> 02:29:36.700
which is the better oxymoron microsoft works

02:29:36.700 --> 02:29:40.920
legally drunk or military intelligence I think the only one of those really

02:29:40.920 --> 02:29:42.540
counts as military intelligence

02:29:42.540 --> 02:29:47.060
honest American I'm honest

02:29:47.060 --> 02:29:50.540
I'll go to somebody and tell them that they fucking suck to their face

02:29:50.540 --> 02:29:55.460
right military intelligence our nuclear weapons

02:29:55.460 --> 02:29:58.660
on the hands of a man who cannot say jingle bells

02:29:58.660 --> 02:30:01.900
there's a problem with that on a different subject yes

02:30:01.900 --> 02:30:04.940
Jamie drives and Jamie driving

02:30:04.940 --> 02:30:07.980
driving with Jamie is kind of fun because she will tell everyone

02:30:07.980 --> 02:30:12.100
that they suck to their faces plus she will flip them off she will like

02:30:12.100 --> 02:30:15.540
speed around them if they're slow she'll just go around them it's great it's so

02:30:15.540 --> 02:30:16.240
entertaining

02:30:16.240 --> 02:30:20.020
Jamie isn't called Dark Satoru for anything

02:30:20.020 --> 02:30:23.380
she'll rage redeem your ass and then tap dance on your fucking grave like

02:30:23.380 --> 02:30:24.420
Savvy and Glover

02:30:24.420 --> 02:30:27.420
And then laugh at your family. It's great.

02:30:27.420 --> 02:30:30.420
That sounds like fun. I should do that next time.

02:30:32.420 --> 02:30:37.420
Okay, so I'm going to play a few songs while we come up with what are...

02:30:37.420 --> 02:30:40.420
Why do people have to get political on Orange Dogs Radio? Fuck them.

02:30:40.420 --> 02:30:44.420
That's because we're older than you, and we actually have something called maturity.

02:30:44.420 --> 02:30:47.420
You can freestyle better than you can. That's it.

02:30:47.420 --> 02:30:49.420
Because we can freestyle better than you can.

02:30:49.420 --> 02:30:51.420
In both respects.

02:30:51.420 --> 02:30:58.420
So let's go ahead and go.

02:31:21.420 --> 02:31:23.420
Under the sun

02:31:23.420 --> 02:31:25.420
She's forgotten everyone

02:31:25.420 --> 02:31:27.420
And has some fun

02:31:27.420 --> 02:31:29.420
Monkey magic

02:31:29.420 --> 02:31:31.420
Monkey magic

02:31:31.420 --> 02:31:33.420
Monkey magic

02:31:33.420 --> 02:31:35.420
Monkey magic

02:31:35.420 --> 02:31:37.420
Monkey magic

02:31:39.420 --> 02:31:43.420
Little, little, little monkey magic

02:31:43.420 --> 02:31:47.420
It's the very best of us

02:31:47.420 --> 02:31:55.420
Since I've never been a monkey, but I do, there's nothing for me, I don't know, yeah

02:32:00.420 --> 02:32:08.420
Oh, sun and egg on the mountain top, the punkiest monkey that ever struck

02:32:08.420 --> 02:32:12.420
We knew every last thing under the sun

02:32:12.420 --> 02:32:16.420
Take the gods and everyone and have some fun

02:32:17.420 --> 02:32:21.420
Monkey Magic!

02:32:21.420 --> 02:32:33.420
Monkey Magic

02:32:51.420 --> 02:32:53.420
Oh

02:34:51.420 --> 02:34:53.420
I

02:37:21.420 --> 02:37:50.660
We're back, um, and we want to say bye to everybody?

02:37:50.660 --> 02:37:57.660
Bye bye everyone, all the listeners of Orange Lounge, I am outta here, I am taking off for the night. Bye bye!

02:37:57.660 --> 02:38:04.660
Thank you, take care, drive safely, bye wifey poo! Take care!

02:38:04.660 --> 02:38:08.660
Thank you, thank you, not just to the people who've been over.

02:38:08.660 --> 02:38:17.660
Okay, so we're back, we've all got our songs, so why don't we just go ahead and we'll start with Loki. What's your top number three alcohol?

02:38:17.660 --> 02:38:20.660
Uh, because I don't drink alcohol.

02:38:20.660 --> 02:38:24.660
Uh, we'll go with number three being Grog, because Monkey Island rules.

02:38:26.660 --> 02:38:29.660
Okay, number three, Grog. And yours?

02:38:30.660 --> 02:38:37.660
Number three on the totem pole would probably have to be, um, Smirnoff vanilla twist alcohol.

02:38:37.660 --> 02:38:41.660
It's good shit. Perfect for mixing with drinks. Especially orange juice.

02:38:43.660 --> 02:38:46.660
Vanilla and orange. Does it be like a cream soda, wouldn't it?

02:38:46.660 --> 02:38:51.060
Okay, um, we actually did have another participant.

02:38:51.060 --> 02:38:55.260
I'll go ahead and name my number three. My number three is Whaler's Vanilla Rum.

02:38:55.260 --> 02:39:01.340
Yummy. I hold Mike now where she types in Whaler's Vanilla Rum, which is probably

02:39:01.340 --> 02:39:02.220
really good stuff.

02:39:02.220 --> 02:39:07.340
Our fourth participant is downstairs. Dark Sakura's going to get her right now.

02:39:07.340 --> 02:39:10.580
She's getting the name of her favorite alcohol.

02:39:10.580 --> 02:39:16.140
She's picking one. She's, uh,

02:39:16.140 --> 02:39:18.500
She's giving us something to drink right now. I don't know

02:39:20.020 --> 02:39:22.020
everybody

02:39:23.860 --> 02:39:25.860
Everybody

02:39:26.740 --> 02:39:30.980
Wait, here's melody with her third favorite alcohol vodka any of it

02:39:31.860 --> 02:39:33.860
Any type of vodka?

02:39:34.500 --> 02:39:36.500
number two favorite alcohol

02:39:36.500 --> 02:39:41.500
Um, this is for Rob because I don't have a number two. Goldschlager.

02:39:46.500 --> 02:39:48.500
So nasty.

02:39:48.500 --> 02:40:01.500
Number two would have to be Sapporo Beer. Sapporo is the best beer, has high alcohol content, it's perfect with sushi, especially if you're watching schoolgirls with chicks in maid outfits doing their thing, it's great.

02:40:01.500 --> 02:40:04.380
great works doesn't school guy uniforms

02:40:04.380 --> 02:40:06.580
since anyway

02:40:06.580 --> 02:40:08.260
actually i think it back

02:40:08.260 --> 02:40:11.500
ron is number three part is number two

02:40:11.500 --> 02:40:14.380
they uh...

02:40:14.380 --> 02:40:15.780
my number three

02:40:15.780 --> 02:40:16.700
is good either

02:40:16.700 --> 02:40:18.860
of course chocolate liqueur

02:40:18.860 --> 02:40:20.080
how can

02:40:20.080 --> 02:40:22.820
that members inside

02:40:22.820 --> 02:40:24.660
your number one

02:40:24.660 --> 02:40:25.540
my number one

02:40:25.540 --> 02:40:28.660
has to be peppermint schnapps because uh...

02:40:28.660 --> 02:40:30.580
after about a full bottle of that

02:40:30.580 --> 02:40:37.900
Both my ex-girlfriend and her friend, I think, went lesbian for, like, the night, so I dedicate

02:40:37.900 --> 02:40:38.900
that to them.

02:40:38.900 --> 02:40:40.180
How come you got in on that?

02:40:40.180 --> 02:40:43.420
You know, that's one of those things that's going to kick me the rest of my life.

02:40:43.420 --> 02:40:44.940
No, I did not.

02:40:44.940 --> 02:40:45.940
Yep.

02:40:45.940 --> 02:40:47.660
So, we think.

02:40:47.660 --> 02:40:48.660
We don't know.

02:40:48.660 --> 02:40:51.540
They disappeared into my room for a while, and they don't remember anything that went

02:40:51.540 --> 02:40:52.540
on.

02:40:52.540 --> 02:40:53.940
So they say.

02:40:53.940 --> 02:40:54.940
So they say.

02:40:54.940 --> 02:40:59.460
If your ex-girlfriend and girlfriend ever disappear into a room under the influence

02:40:59.460 --> 02:41:05.260
of alcohol. You better be up in that motherfucker. Yeah, ex-girlfriend and her friend. Well,

02:41:05.260 --> 02:41:09.420
she was my girlfriend at the time, so yeah, I should have, but... I would have been all

02:41:09.420 --> 02:41:14.060
over that like a bad rash on Pamela Anderson-Lee. Number one would have to be the Godiva soy

02:41:14.060 --> 02:41:17.980
milk combination that I had tonight with Dark Sakura. That's the new number one. It goes

02:41:17.980 --> 02:41:22.260
down smooth and God damn, I'm buzzing. I'm so numb that somebody could cut my arm off

02:41:22.260 --> 02:41:26.980
and beat me with it and I would not feel it. First off was, hey Jamie, you want to go in

02:41:26.980 --> 02:41:30.180
that room five feet away and lock the door well you know they did say that

02:41:30.180 --> 02:41:40.580
after I got socially drunk I turned lesbian and my number one has to be that

02:41:40.580 --> 02:41:44.940
Vermeer chocolate liquor that Mel gave me because good lord that shit is good

02:41:44.940 --> 02:41:50.260
v-e-r-m-e-e-r it's Dutch chocolate liquor and you can get in it Safeway

02:41:50.260 --> 02:41:54.820
best shouts out to Felix the friendly traveler for providing the alcohol at

02:41:54.820 --> 02:42:01.260
Go pick up any project that learns try find a feels friendly traveler do cuz that's dope shit Felix. You may never know

02:42:01.780 --> 02:42:03.620
2003 I could come back

02:42:03.620 --> 02:42:08.340
My number one would be just desserts brand creme brulee liqueur

02:42:09.100 --> 02:42:12.100
You get it Trader Joe's that's the only this I've seen that one

02:42:12.100 --> 02:42:16.660
And it's like six dollars a bottle and it tastes like it should cost more that stuff is the best

02:42:18.860 --> 02:42:20.860
So you want to go ahead and vote off one

02:42:20.860 --> 02:42:33.860
Okay, uh, just because someone else is going to vote it off and I'll just save them the time, Grog, because that's a stupid, uh, a stupid, uh, third pick by me and I just don't care. I'm tired.

02:42:33.860 --> 02:42:40.860
Um, we have to get rid of the sapro even though it's one of my favorites because it is a...

02:42:41.380 --> 02:42:46.140
I put it on there, but in comparison to the other alcohols, it's a beer. And beer just

02:42:46.140 --> 02:42:50.900
doesn't stand up to liquor. Although it is an acquired taste, liquor has more of a flavor

02:42:50.900 --> 02:42:55.900
to it. You can't mix liquor, you can mix liquor with anything, you can't mix beer with anything.

02:42:55.900 --> 02:42:59.900
Vote one off the island.

02:42:59.900 --> 02:43:03.620
Jerry, no, um, um,

02:43:03.620 --> 02:43:08.780
what are our options? I'm saying rum because even though I voted it on

02:43:08.780 --> 02:43:13.220
I got really freaking drunk on it once and it made me unhappy.

02:43:13.220 --> 02:43:16.940
God, everyone's voting their own shit off. You left the light on in the bathroom?

02:43:16.940 --> 02:43:21.300
Oh, that's why. Okay, um, well, you know what I'm gonna vote off?

02:43:21.300 --> 02:43:25.580
Peppermint schnapps!

02:43:25.580 --> 02:43:29.260
Because I've had peppermint schnapps before

02:43:29.260 --> 02:43:32.260
And I thought it was going to kill me. It tasted like burning.

02:43:32.260 --> 02:43:36.260
It tasted like burning heat.

02:43:39.260 --> 02:43:42.260
And that's what they felt that night.

02:43:42.260 --> 02:43:46.260
God damn it. See, Peppermint Schnoss, man.

02:43:46.260 --> 02:43:49.260
That shit got my ex-girlfriend to yell,

02:43:49.260 --> 02:43:53.260
I can suck his dick and you can't, arguing with her friend.

02:43:53.260 --> 02:43:56.260
I just heard you say that you can suck someone's dick.

02:43:56.260 --> 02:43:59.260
No, I was quoting my ex-girlfriend, okay?

02:43:59.260 --> 02:44:03.260
There's absolutely nothing wrong with sucking dick as long as the person is clean.

02:44:03.260 --> 02:44:05.260
Let's not get that twisted.

02:44:05.260 --> 02:44:10.260
Although I don't know about Loki's sex life, the guy's cute enough, but that's another story too.

02:44:10.260 --> 02:44:13.260
Don't say that shit while I've been drinking.

02:44:13.260 --> 02:44:17.260
We're fucking listening, so obviously you only caught the last half.

02:44:17.260 --> 02:44:20.260
I still want Gak's sexy body, but anyway.

02:44:20.260 --> 02:44:23.260
Do I get to vote another one off now, or...?

02:44:23.260 --> 02:44:25.600
ALLLL!

02:44:25.600 --> 02:44:28.360
Bitch?

02:44:28.360 --> 02:44:30.080
No!

02:44:30.080 --> 02:44:31.240
Chat room,

02:44:31.240 --> 02:44:33.780
this is where YOU decide!

02:44:33.780 --> 02:44:35.940
Oh God, I didn't mean to loud.

02:44:35.940 --> 02:44:38.960
To loud! I didn't mean to loud.

02:44:38.960 --> 02:44:40.820
Ok, you've got

02:44:40.820 --> 02:44:42.600
a few minutes

02:44:42.600 --> 02:44:44.660
to send me your votes.

02:44:44.660 --> 02:44:46.700
And if you don't send me your votes, I KILL YOU!

02:44:46.700 --> 02:44:49.480
I mean... wait, I don't kill you.

02:44:49.480 --> 02:44:50.360
uh...

02:44:50.360 --> 02:44:54.320
send me your votes and in the meantime just to make johnnie happy

02:44:54.320 --> 02:44:58.600
we're gonna play uh... and see how can your car so yeah if you want to see how

02:44:58.600 --> 02:45:01.620
can you and or send in your vote

02:45:01.620 --> 02:45:04.360
for best liquor

02:45:04.360 --> 02:45:08.280
and every read the list and then it was sent to the chair and

02:45:08.280 --> 02:45:12.160
just give me a second kind of important

02:45:12.160 --> 02:45:16.520
you know i think that we could hear it when i'm out when i got my alcoholic

02:45:16.520 --> 02:45:23.520
the

02:45:23.520 --> 02:45:25.720
it's into the freaking chair

02:45:25.720 --> 02:45:28.600
uh... there we go to him okay

02:45:28.600 --> 02:45:30.680
so that's one of those

02:45:30.680 --> 02:45:32.280
you have uh...

02:45:32.280 --> 02:45:34.660
telling the stuff

02:45:34.660 --> 02:45:37.000
three minutes and twenty five seconds

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:44.000
vote now or die

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:49.000
Ah, yeah. That's right, motherfuckers.

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:52.000
I'm back, riding a funky track.

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:57.000
I got a story to tell you all, so listen up.

02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:00.000
Yo, trip on this.

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:05.000
I'm rolling through the boat on a Saturday night, got a 40 in my left hand dig in my right,

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:10.000
some cron in my lap, a pager in my hat, and a 9mm in the small of my back.

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.080
I'm just chillin, no place to be

02:46:12.080 --> 02:46:14.400
I take another pro off my 40Z

02:46:14.400 --> 02:46:16.800
I'm thinking about skinning a fat ass tree

02:46:16.800 --> 02:46:19.200
A B to the L to the UMP

02:46:19.200 --> 02:46:21.280
Then I get a call on my dope cell phone

02:46:21.280 --> 02:46:22.640
Check the caller IP

02:46:22.640 --> 02:46:23.760
What up hoes

02:46:23.760 --> 02:46:25.840
Yo it's the Doom and his news ain't good

02:46:25.840 --> 02:46:28.240
Little Pookie got capped last night in the hood

02:46:28.240 --> 02:46:30.480
I feel like the world is fading away

02:46:30.480 --> 02:46:33.040
I saw Little Pookie just the other day

02:46:33.040 --> 02:46:35.360
Pookie was my oily shitted coid in the park

02:46:35.360 --> 02:46:37.520
Now some punks took his life in the dark

02:46:37.520 --> 02:46:42.160
I ask doomsday who the motherfuckers be to punk fb from MIT

02:46:42.160 --> 02:46:44.400
The fucking institute man I should have known

02:46:44.400 --> 02:46:46.880
I say meet me at my crib and hang up the phone

02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:48.960
Playtime's over I got the job to do

02:46:48.960 --> 02:46:51.360
And the world will be less crowded by the time I poop

02:46:51.360 --> 02:46:53.600
And I'll keep rolling while bullets fly

02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:56.220
cause all my shoamines be dry and biased

02:47:13.800 --> 02:47:15.240
1 minute to midnight

02:47:15.740 --> 02:47:16.740
we hit the street

02:47:16.900 --> 02:47:18.040
code as a cadaver

02:47:18.040 --> 02:47:19.180
our best concrete

02:47:19.280 --> 02:47:20.340
doomsday packing

02:47:20.440 --> 02:47:21.160
Baby Mac

02:47:21.300 --> 02:47:22.660
Got my AK-47

02:47:22.660 --> 02:47:27.560
of the nine in my back. The alpine's flowing, he's flowing, got my swerve on tight and my

02:47:27.560 --> 02:47:33.060
game face showing. Him damn punks are gonna pay, the hawks on the case, a bird of prey.

02:47:33.060 --> 02:47:38.420
Then up ahead, cold chilling in the street, six motherfuckers from MIT, I flick off the

02:47:38.420 --> 02:47:44.020
safety check, my grip and load. A dumb dumb clip, I glance at the doom to make sure he's

02:47:44.020 --> 02:47:49.300
packed, his dinkers on the traitor of his baby mac. Time to give a Newtonian demonstration

02:47:49.300 --> 02:47:51.620
of the bullet, its mass and its acceleration

02:47:51.620 --> 02:47:53.780
dying on my lap, AK in my hand

02:47:53.780 --> 02:47:56.180
I roll up slow, like a snake in the sand

02:47:56.180 --> 02:47:58.260
I wait till I'm sure they can see my face

02:47:58.260 --> 02:48:00.820
then I bust out slugs to the beat of the bass

02:48:00.820 --> 02:48:02.980
we sketch out in the full moonlight

02:48:02.980 --> 02:48:05.140
MIT punks dying left and right

02:48:05.140 --> 02:48:07.460
there's nowhere to run, don't even try

02:48:07.460 --> 02:48:10.020
cause all my shoo-bings need drying pies

02:48:10.020 --> 02:48:14.020
Don't drop by

02:48:14.020 --> 02:48:18.020
Don't drop by

02:48:18.020 --> 02:48:22.020
Don't drop by

02:48:22.020 --> 02:48:26.020
Don't drop by

02:48:30.020 --> 02:48:32.020
Then silence hits the street like a bomb

02:48:32.020 --> 02:48:35.020
And eerie calm like the eye of the storm

02:48:35.020 --> 02:48:37.020
Beneath the glow of an old street light

02:48:37.020 --> 02:48:40.020
Dev MIT punks in the only site

02:48:40.020 --> 02:48:42.020
Six motherfuckers no longer alive

02:48:42.020 --> 02:48:44.020
Pooties in a vent one for one plus five

02:48:44.020 --> 02:48:46.020
And we'll be long gone before the cops arrive

02:48:46.020 --> 02:48:49.020
Cause all my shootings being drive-bys

02:48:49.020 --> 02:48:50.020
Hi-yah!

02:48:50.020 --> 02:48:55.020
I'm busting more shit than an incontinent man of a chilli tuck-off

02:48:55.020 --> 02:48:57.020
The moral of the story is

02:48:57.020 --> 02:48:59.020
Don't fuck with the Hawkman

02:48:59.020 --> 02:49:02.020
Cause the Hawkman ain't done with the M-I-4 and I-4 shit

02:49:02.020 --> 02:49:04.020
Fuck man

02:49:04.020 --> 02:49:07.020
Take tonight, and I'll take your motherfucking head.

02:49:07.020 --> 02:49:30.020
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

02:49:30.020 --> 02:49:40.020
We're back. We almost have winners. In the meantime though, we're going to give the microphone

02:49:40.020 --> 02:49:42.020
to Jockey to rant for a while.

02:49:42.020 --> 02:49:49.020
Cool. I get to rant. I don't know it's a rant. They're discussing the alcohols right now.

02:49:49.020 --> 02:49:54.020
They're doing rock, paper, scissors. They're still making a decision. If we have an afterbirth

02:49:54.020 --> 02:49:58.020
tonight, I might kick some shit. I don't know. That was MC Hawking on the last track, one

02:49:58.020 --> 02:50:01.700
one of the hardest motherfuckers I know with all my shootings be drive-bys

02:50:01.700 --> 02:50:04.260
and I wouldn't fuck with them because they'll shoot you

02:50:04.260 --> 02:50:08.500
all right well we have our three winners number three

02:50:08.500 --> 02:50:10.340
Godiva and vanilla soy milk

02:50:10.340 --> 02:50:13.900
combo

02:50:13.900 --> 02:50:16.740
I'm going to get another one right now

02:50:16.740 --> 02:50:20.940
second place is Smirnoff vanilla twist alcohol

02:50:20.940 --> 02:50:22.460
and number one is

02:50:22.460 --> 02:50:23.700
Godiva

02:50:23.700 --> 02:50:27.140
yay!

02:50:27.140 --> 02:50:29.140
None of those people had Vermeer!

02:50:57.140 --> 02:51:00.140
Do we know where this can be found?

02:51:00.140 --> 02:51:03.140
Nope. Can't remember offhand.

02:51:03.140 --> 02:51:06.140
You see that box there with the mushrooms on the lid?

02:51:06.140 --> 02:51:17.140
Those are 2600 ROMs and, uh, they're actually game chips and a thing to play them on a 2600.

02:51:17.140 --> 02:51:18.140
Cool.

02:51:18.140 --> 02:51:23.140
I think Custer's Revenge is in there somewhere.

02:51:23.140 --> 02:51:27.140
Yeah, I'm real interested.

02:51:27.140 --> 02:51:29.500
Pixelated penis.

02:51:29.500 --> 02:51:32.180
Custer's revenge is so funny.

02:51:32.180 --> 02:51:37.380
No, Custer's revenge for the 2600, the porn game.

02:51:37.380 --> 02:51:38.860
Oh, sweet.

02:51:38.860 --> 02:51:39.360
Yeah.

02:51:39.360 --> 02:51:40.360
I didn't say porn game.

02:51:40.360 --> 02:51:40.940
I don't know.

02:51:40.940 --> 02:51:42.300
You said Custer.

02:51:42.300 --> 02:51:43.620
Custer.

02:51:43.620 --> 02:51:50.380
Anyway, did you ever see the one called X-Man?

02:51:50.380 --> 02:51:57.620
It was this guy running through a maze, and you had to get through the middle of the maze,

02:51:57.620 --> 02:52:00.420
being chased by a giant pair of scissors.

02:52:00.420 --> 02:52:10.780
And then when you get to the end of the maze, what you have to do is fuck somebody.

02:52:10.780 --> 02:52:12.820
And it's like pixelated cock and everything.

02:52:12.820 --> 02:52:15.380
It's really, really scary and really wrong.

02:52:15.380 --> 02:52:19.260
And anyway, on the note of pixelated cock, I think that we should go ahead and end this

02:52:19.260 --> 02:52:21.260
bit of a wreck is you know what

02:52:21.260 --> 02:52:24.280
i don't think i'm going to do very well in the junction of the next every week

02:52:24.280 --> 02:52:25.620
so robs here

02:52:25.620 --> 02:52:32.620
and then i'll take it let him be the silver one

02:52:35.180 --> 02:52:39.300
so why don't we go ahead and then their final thoughts for the evening

02:52:39.300 --> 02:52:42.300
i'm tired need to work on my website

02:52:42.300 --> 02:52:47.140
yes you do

02:52:47.140 --> 02:52:54.140
Sorry out there to all you people who just got, like, an earful of food's on.

02:52:55.620 --> 02:52:59.660
There's a certain someone I'm waiting to give me a call on Valentine's Day. Hope she calls me.

02:52:59.660 --> 02:53:02.900
Motherfuck Puff Daddy and a ton of other people in the industry.

02:53:02.900 --> 02:53:06.700
I'm bitter, goddammit. Fuck Walmart. Fuck a whole bunch of other people.

02:53:06.700 --> 02:53:10.220
Good dive on. Soy milk is really good. Thanks to

02:53:10.220 --> 02:53:14.820
Jamie for allowing me to speak on OrangeLounge.com

02:53:14.820 --> 02:53:16.820
And

02:53:17.460 --> 02:53:19.260
That's it

02:53:19.260 --> 02:53:25.260
Sadly enough after what like five or six drinks. I'm still not

02:53:26.180 --> 02:53:28.440
I'm still not drunk that bad

02:53:29.740 --> 02:53:31.660
so I

02:53:31.660 --> 02:53:35.540
Wish I could go to the strip club, but that's a lot of money, and I don't have the money

02:53:35.540 --> 02:53:46.180
So let's go ahead and end this trainwreck, stay tuned though for a special, messy surprise.

02:53:46.180 --> 02:53:52.900
