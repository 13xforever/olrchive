[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll go ahead and go to break.

02:48.259 --> 02:50.920

[SPEAKER_03]: Animal Crack.

10:23.252 --> 10:25.093
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one of our special guests up here, though.

10:25.193 --> 10:25.653
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hi.

10:26.574 --> 10:27.254
[SPEAKER_25]: Yo, what's up?

10:27.274 --> 10:30.075
[SPEAKER_25]: This is Jay Kinetic, representing Step Spot in the Bay Area.

10:30.196 --> 10:30.956
[SPEAKER_25]: How you doing, Jamie?

10:32.217 --> 10:34.118
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on my way to intoxication.

10:34.498 --> 10:34.958
[SPEAKER_03]: I see this.

10:35.278 --> 10:37.820
[SPEAKER_03]: You're already a glass ahead of me.

10:38.786 --> 10:40.648
[SPEAKER_25]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

10:58.564 --> 10:59.765
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a microphone in my face.

11:00.045 --> 11:00.405
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit.

11:02.827 --> 11:03.968
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Sky Vodka.

11:04.128 --> 11:06.770
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll take phrases that Mariah Carey's gotten used to for 500.

11:07.010 --> 11:09.052
[SPEAKER_25]: Ah, there's a microphone in my face!

11:10.433 --> 11:11.113
[SPEAKER_03]: That was wrong.

11:12.974 --> 11:13.855
[SPEAKER_03]: And how are you doing tonight?

11:15.256 --> 11:20.880
[SPEAKER_22]: I was doing good until I ate something, and that something happened to be McDonald's, and then McDonald's is ripping me up.

11:22.101 --> 11:24.603
[SPEAKER_25]: What you want is what you vomit at McDonald's today.

11:26.218 --> 11:30.936
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, then McDonald's is going to need a PR campaign to undo all the damage you just did.

11:32.352 --> 11:44.038
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, actually, yesterday I wasn't feeling too good either, or the day before, because I made this spaghetti with this really cool sauce I got off the internet, like this recipe off of Robert and Don, the radio show I listen to every morning.

11:44.638 --> 11:53.563
[SPEAKER_22]: And it was really good, but the thing is, it calls for two full bulbs of garlic ground up, along with a large red onion.

11:53.583 --> 12:00.627
[SPEAKER_22]: So you have pretty much like this, half of it is onion and garlic, and then the rest is all tomatoes and stuff, and it's really good.

12:01.407 --> 12:07.751
[SPEAKER_22]: The problem is, when you have that much garlic, you just eat a little bit of it and it makes your stomach really, really gassy.

12:08.951 --> 12:09.672
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, actually, no.

12:09.692 --> 12:13.774
[SPEAKER_25]: The problem is you'll need about three bottles of Listerine after you eat two bulbs of garlic and a red onion.

12:13.934 --> 12:17.256
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, God, you could probably breathe on somebody and it's probably, like, toxic.

12:19.177 --> 12:20.977
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, so it was really good.

12:21.638 --> 12:25.960
[SPEAKER_22]: It just felt like you eat just a little bit of it and you feel, like, full already.

12:26.160 --> 12:27.081
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's weird.

12:27.101 --> 12:27.801
[SPEAKER_22]: It's the weirdest feeling.

12:27.821 --> 12:28.601
[SPEAKER_22]: You just feel full.

12:29.102 --> 12:29.422
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

12:30.683 --> 12:33.425
[SPEAKER_25]: Now the worst time I had was when I prepared some spaghetti.

12:33.445 --> 12:42.991
[SPEAKER_25]: I was cooking for my ex at the time and she'd come over and I was cooking and I threw something that wasn't tobacco into the spaghetti sauce along with some alcohol.

12:44.481 --> 12:46.543
[SPEAKER_25]: I didn't feel the effects for the first 30 minutes.

12:46.583 --> 12:50.927
[SPEAKER_25]: I sat down to use my computer after she went home, and all of a sudden that hit me like Viking and I was out.

12:51.027 --> 12:52.288
[SPEAKER_25]: It was scary.

12:52.789 --> 12:53.409
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's Shermie.

12:53.890 --> 12:54.771
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look very slowly.

12:54.911 --> 12:56.032
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, she just went back under the thing.

12:56.392 --> 12:59.695
[SPEAKER_03]: Shermie decided to peek out and say hi to everybody, but then she went back under the bed.

13:01.317 --> 13:02.258
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, poor baby.

13:04.680 --> 13:06.022
[SPEAKER_25]: So what's the topic tonight anyway?

13:06.621 --> 13:07.041
[SPEAKER_03]: The topic?

13:07.581 --> 13:09.082
[SPEAKER_03]: The topic is, Rob ain't here!

13:09.302 --> 13:10.022
[SPEAKER_03]: Party time!

13:11.242 --> 13:14.043
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he decided to go down to that Cyber Beat Nation thing.

13:14.583 --> 13:15.384
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, huh?

13:18.024 --> 13:19.645
[SPEAKER_03]: Melody said like there's never a topic on the show.

13:19.705 --> 13:20.705
[SPEAKER_03]: Come up here, Melody!

13:22.846 --> 13:24.987
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, we have our models in here tonight, DarkSakura.

13:25.007 --> 13:25.887
[SPEAKER_25]: Melody's on her way up.

13:25.947 --> 13:28.748
[SPEAKER_25]: She's having a hard time getting up the stairs because Animal Crack is calling her.

13:28.768 --> 13:29.368
[SPEAKER_25]: Say hi, Melody.

13:30.149 --> 13:32.650
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I'm having a hard time coming up the stairs because I'm half drunk.

13:33.150 --> 13:34.211
[SPEAKER_28]: That's the reason why.

13:35.011 --> 13:36.192
[SPEAKER_11]: Lightweight.

13:36.972 --> 13:38.092
[SPEAKER_28]: Lightweight.

13:38.433 --> 13:40.553
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, I'm a lightweight and I'm damn proud of it, okay?

13:40.593 --> 13:41.814
[SPEAKER_28]: That means I'm a cheap date.

13:43.435 --> 13:45.996
[SPEAKER_25]: Ooh, shouts out to Mel down at Cyber Beat Nation.

13:46.036 --> 13:50.638
[SPEAKER_25]: I heard Tigger, did Tigger take first in a... Okay, we're going to announce that.

13:50.658 --> 13:51.478
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry, I didn't want to ruin it.

13:51.960 --> 13:56.242
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go ahead and... Yeah, what's this topic?

13:56.322 --> 13:56.542
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

13:57.823 --> 14:00.464
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go ahead and announce the winners of Cyber Beat Nation.

14:01.665 --> 14:03.766
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll start with 2DX.

14:04.946 --> 14:06.467
[SPEAKER_03]: In third place, we have DJ Hobba.

14:07.087 --> 14:08.288

[SPEAKER_03]: Third place, Bimaniac from Canada.

[SPEAKER_03]: Second place, we have... Thank you.

14:20.073 --> 14:21.554
[SPEAKER_25]: Shouts to Canada, though.

14:21.914 --> 14:22.834
[SPEAKER_25]: Much love to Canada, though.

14:22.874 --> 14:24.555
[SPEAKER_25]: Y'all got good women.

14:24.575 --> 14:25.855
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, second place, JS Blade.

14:25.895 --> 14:26.695
[SPEAKER_24]: No, no, no.

14:26.956 --> 14:27.796
[SPEAKER_24]: No, they have good laws.

14:29.056 --> 14:31.037
[SPEAKER_24]: No, Canada, props to Canada for having good laws.

14:33.878 --> 14:34.698
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, say hi.

14:35.018 --> 14:35.598
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, people.

14:36.698 --> 14:38.959
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and in first place, for PA, we have Tigger.

14:39.839 --> 14:41.620
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're surprised!

14:42.859 --> 14:43.600
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, my God!

14:43.840 --> 14:44.701
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, heart attack!

14:44.741 --> 14:45.582
[SPEAKER_03]: Tigger won PA!

14:45.782 --> 14:46.723
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, God, it hurts!

14:47.223 --> 14:47.343
Ah!

14:47.784 --> 14:49.205
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, fuck, I'm dying!

14:49.325 --> 14:51.587
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just still pretty thrilled that Rob beat Rhea at Fremont.

14:51.908 --> 14:52.909
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, true, true, true.

14:52.949 --> 14:55.491
[SPEAKER_25]: Respect to Tigger, though, because that's one of the coolest PA-ers I've met.

14:55.511 --> 14:56.772
[SPEAKER_25]: He never got an ego about this shit.

14:56.792 --> 14:57.333
[SPEAKER_25]: Shouts to him.

14:57.813 --> 14:58.093
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

14:58.914 --> 14:59.555
[SPEAKER_03]: Freestyle.

15:00.396 --> 15:03.739
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a total NorCal showing, except for, like, one person.

15:04.740 --> 15:07.642
[SPEAKER_03]: In fourth place, our very own Step Squad boy, Wendell.

15:07.863 --> 15:08.183
[SPEAKER_03]: Book, book!

15:09.561 --> 15:12.482
[SPEAKER_03]: and third place we have AJ of, um, RTF.

15:14.882 --> 15:18.623
[SPEAKER_03]: Second place, I think I got this right because I could barely hear Rob when he told me Master 42.

15:19.284 --> 15:20.664
[SPEAKER_03]: If I have that wrong, I'll correct it.

15:21.164 --> 15:22.885
[SPEAKER_03]: And in first place, Bruce Leroy.

15:25.385 --> 15:30.206
[SPEAKER_03]: So, he won a Max 2 machine, which means everyone's gonna go hang out at his house.

15:32.107 --> 15:34.468
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so that was a...

15:37.071 --> 15:42.453
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a pretty good showing there for NorCal, so... Fuck NorCal, fuck you!

15:42.693 --> 15:46.175
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck NorCal, fuck you!

15:46.935 --> 15:51.777
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no, we have to be nice to our out-of-state people because... You said it first!

15:51.957 --> 15:54.899
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind, I lived in Alabama where we had no bimani.

15:54.919 --> 15:56.839
[SPEAKER_03]: When I went there to visit in April, you know what they had?

15:57.540 --> 15:58.800
[SPEAKER_03]: A Korean Dance Maniacs.

15:59.861 --> 16:00.541
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh my god!

16:01.381 --> 16:02.542
[SPEAKER_25]: Down in Newark...

16:03.450 --> 16:10.373
[SPEAKER_25]: Down at Newark, in New Park Mall, I think Ross was with me when I played this, uh, they have Dance Maniacs, in Korean!

16:11.453 --> 16:12.593
[SPEAKER_25]: Dance Freaks, in Korean!

16:12.813 --> 16:16.715
[SPEAKER_25]: I've never played this game before and I was amazed by this, I'm like, they have Korean songs on this?

16:17.015 --> 16:19.796
[SPEAKER_25]: Didn't they have, uh, uh, Kleon, Funky Tonight or something?

16:21.437 --> 16:22.397
[SPEAKER_25]: They had another Klon song.

16:24.588 --> 16:29.872
[SPEAKER_24]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

16:47.727 --> 16:52.170
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, I found out that they recently got a Beatmania, an actual Beatmania machine.

16:53.271 --> 17:00.936
[SPEAKER_03]: Just in the hallway at the mall outside the movie theater that the mall I used to work at, which actually, if what I understand correctly, is actually where my arcade used to be.

17:01.176 --> 17:02.337
[SPEAKER_03]: But they moved the arcade further down.

17:03.658 --> 17:04.979
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and Latin's Castle.

17:06.100 --> 17:08.202
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked for Namco at one time.

17:09.002 --> 17:11.844
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked at Cyberzone.

17:13.505 --> 17:14.006
[SPEAKER_03]: Cyberstation.

17:15.439 --> 17:22.944
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh yeah, this show of ours has been brought to you by Islander's Crooked Eye Special Brew, a unique malt beverage with natural flavors.

17:23.364 --> 17:25.545
[SPEAKER_25]: That's code word for it gets you fucked up.

17:27.887 --> 17:28.907
[SPEAKER_24]: He wouldn't let me buy the Schlitz.

17:29.267 --> 17:30.448
[SPEAKER_24]: He just wouldn't let me buy the Schlitz.

17:30.468 --> 17:31.329
[SPEAKER_24]: I wanted the Schlitz.

17:32.145 --> 17:34.947
[SPEAKER_24]: I wanted to shlitz, I wanted to represent- IT'S SHLITZ!

17:35.007 --> 17:35.427
[SPEAKER_03]: I'LL KILL YOU!

17:35.447 --> 17:36.387
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you know what you need?

17:36.548 --> 17:38.589
[SPEAKER_03]: What you need is an ice-cold Colt 45.

17:38.829 --> 17:42.911
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, if we didn't have that, I would've, I would've, but he would've let me!

17:43.071 --> 17:44.932
[SPEAKER_03]: Somewhere Billy Dee Williams is having a cry.

17:45.372 --> 17:46.673
[SPEAKER_24]: I know, I know he is.

17:47.994 --> 17:49.875
[SPEAKER_24]: You're being awfully- He's just so smooth.

17:50.355 --> 17:51.376
[SPEAKER_03]: You're being awfully quiet.

17:53.057 --> 17:54.638
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that's because I feel like a blimp.

17:55.738 --> 17:56.739
[SPEAKER_22]: I feel fat.

17:59.563 --> 18:00.444
[SPEAKER_22]: and Sassy.

18:10.128 --> 18:12.909
[SPEAKER_25]: The chat room is like, what the hell is wrong with these people?

18:16.111 --> 18:25.435
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if any of you are old enough to remember this, but late night TV did show the 40 ounce liquor alcohol, they do one for Colt 45, with Billy Dee Williams at a party.

18:27.712 --> 18:28.994
[SPEAKER_03]: Cult 45, Red Dog, Urban Beers, Water and Piss

18:45.592 --> 18:47.934
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when I lived in, I lived in the hood at one time.

18:50.595 --> 18:51.736
[SPEAKER_03]: Del Paso Heights.

18:54.418 --> 18:58.441
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you could tell at one time, maybe back in the 50s, it was a nice neighborhood.

18:58.521 --> 19:06.246
[SPEAKER_03]: But the place was all like, you know, the houses were, there were some, you know, hood houses and dogs running down the street.

19:06.306 --> 19:08.787
[SPEAKER_03]: People would go down with their loud bass while I'm trying to sleep at 4 in the morning.

19:09.488 --> 19:14.771
[SPEAKER_03]: And on New Year's Eve, our friend Tina, we call her Beanie, she came over.

19:15.972 --> 19:20.737
[SPEAKER_03]: While we were having our big anime marathon, we were watching Cowboy Bebop.

19:21.778 --> 19:25.903
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were playing Samba de Amigo and she brought me a 40 ounce Corona.

19:27.156 --> 19:33.939
[SPEAKER_03]: and said, but I felt inclined to go drink it on my couch, but I didn't have chairs or a couch.

19:34.819 --> 19:36.299
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

19:37.460 --> 19:38.340
[SPEAKER_25]: That's the sad thing.

19:38.480 --> 19:39.701
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, I'm from the slums.

19:40.181 --> 19:43.162
[SPEAKER_25]: I originally spent like half of my existence in Oakland, California.

19:43.562 --> 19:50.665
[SPEAKER_25]: And what's sad about Oakland is that there are three things that you will find in most neighborhoods, and that's a liquor store, a nail shop,

19:52.063 --> 19:53.425
[SPEAKER_25]: and like a church.

19:54.065 --> 19:57.509
[SPEAKER_25]: You'll find those all within a block proximity of each other.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.251
[SPEAKER_03]: There are five churches by my house in DPH.

20:00.106 --> 20:01.948
[SPEAKER_25]: You don't need five churches in one neighborhood.

20:01.988 --> 20:02.728
[SPEAKER_25]: That's scary.

20:03.209 --> 20:07.212
[SPEAKER_25]: But we saw this, and they'd all be selling the most crappy beers on the planet.

20:07.252 --> 20:10.835
[SPEAKER_25]: We're talking like Natural Ice and like Schlitz and like Red Dog.

20:11.236 --> 20:14.718
[SPEAKER_25]: You name it, and it's a ghetto beer that you probably saw an advertisement for in the source.

20:14.779 --> 20:17.521
[SPEAKER_25]: They had it, and it was just bad, and you knew it was a rig up.

20:17.921 --> 20:19.062
[SPEAKER_25]: But you couldn't do anything about it.

20:19.402 --> 20:24.146
[SPEAKER_25]: So I guess the idea was you drank your Mad Dog 2020 and went to church because that was the only way you could put up with the people there.

20:24.166 --> 20:24.607
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not sure.

20:25.871 --> 20:27.311
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what?

20:27.511 --> 20:30.072
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny that we're talking about alcohol on a Ben Monte show.

20:30.192 --> 20:30.732
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah!

20:31.453 --> 20:32.833
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever tried to play DDR Drunk?

20:35.134 --> 20:40.915
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm happy to say that I got a ton of perfects while I was off of four TGI Fridays drinks, despite the fact that they were weak.

20:41.295 --> 20:48.938
[SPEAKER_25]: I was not drunk enough yet, so I went to the store, got two pints of Sapporo beer, good stuff, went up to the DDR machine and was scoring B's and A's all day.

20:48.958 --> 20:50.398
[SPEAKER_25]: It's all about Drunk Drunk Revolution.

20:51.124 --> 20:54.385
[SPEAKER_03]: First night I met Wendell at Faname of 2001.

20:55.525 --> 20:58.925
[SPEAKER_03]: He proceeded to beat Afronova Maniac while drunk.

21:00.686 --> 21:02.426
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think he's been able to do it sober, right?

21:03.706 --> 21:04.566
[SPEAKER_03]: That was awesome.

21:05.566 --> 21:06.427
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not quite sure.

21:07.147 --> 21:13.448
[SPEAKER_25]: I would DDR naked with the right person, but you'd have to have a private machine, because I don't want my wang flapping around.

21:13.968 --> 21:15.888
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have upskirt can, thank you very much.

21:15.928 --> 21:17.108
[SPEAKER_03]: I have played DDR in my pajamas.

21:18.549 --> 21:20.869
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a woman playing DDR without a bra, it's painful.

21:22.674 --> 21:23.875
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

21:40.991 --> 21:43.274
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, there's quite a bit going on.

21:44.355 --> 21:54.747
[SPEAKER_22]: New Stepmania, our new CVS update for February 12th CVS snapshot for that.

21:54.847 --> 21:58.651
[SPEAKER_22]: They're really making it sort of like, it's becoming more of...

21:59.592 --> 22:01.935
[SPEAKER_22]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

22:16.711 --> 22:17.391
[SPEAKER_22]: It's really cool.

22:18.091 --> 22:23.093
[SPEAKER_22]: They also have added Marvelouses and a whole bunch of new modifiers on there now.

22:23.133 --> 22:27.574
[SPEAKER_22]: They have one that's called Land, which is just like in the Oni Course trick.

22:29.054 --> 22:32.555
[SPEAKER_22]: It's kind of a reverse boost where it slows way down.

22:32.935 --> 22:40.296
[SPEAKER_22]: They have one called Expand, where it kind of just expands and contracts as it goes up the screen.

22:40.477 --> 22:41.237
[SPEAKER_22]: And then they've got...

22:42.657 --> 22:43.458
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

23:01.613 --> 23:03.335
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm still working on my website.

23:03.375 --> 23:11.966
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm taking my time though because I'm going to be adding CD titles to everything and just making sure it's fully done that way.

23:12.066 --> 23:15.610
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a full set of DDR Extreme sim files that will be coming up.

23:17.513 --> 23:19.134
[SPEAKER_22]: Everything that's released so far, of course.

23:19.975 --> 23:22.597
[SPEAKER_22]: And then, let's see what else.

23:23.558 --> 23:24.779
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know, a whole bunch of shit.

23:26.100 --> 23:29.503
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, DWI Insanity, they just released A.U.

23:30.464 --> 23:33.747
[SPEAKER_22]: Trance 2, a non-stop DWI.

23:34.267 --> 23:35.529
[SPEAKER_22]: It's 35 minutes long.

23:36.970 --> 23:37.851
[SPEAKER_22]: I played it last night.

23:39.212 --> 23:43.476
[SPEAKER_22]: After about 20 minutes, your hand just... It doesn't hurt anymore, but...

23:43.996 --> 23:44.897
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that was pretty fun.

23:45.097 --> 23:52.887
[SPEAKER_22]: And then, let's see, other than that, BomaniSell switched to a new server thanks to kind donations from the community.

23:53.127 --> 23:56.271
[SPEAKER_22]: And so they should be bringing up more sim files on that site, too.

23:56.731 --> 23:58.974
[SPEAKER_22]: Probably see the rest of DDR Extreme stuff come up.

23:59.314 --> 24:01.116
[SPEAKER_22]: And same with DDR UK.

24:01.156 --> 24:03.839
[SPEAKER_22]: They've just re-put up all their new stuff on new...

24:04.560 --> 24:08.161
[SPEAKER_22]: We should also make a mention about our contest.

24:26.776 --> 24:30.979
[SPEAKER_22]: Our old TV themed DWI contest.

24:31.039 --> 24:37.603
[SPEAKER_22]: We don't really have a due date yet, but it's going to be done to any old TV theme.

24:38.483 --> 24:39.204
[SPEAKER_22]: Only TV themes.

24:39.504 --> 24:41.825
[SPEAKER_22]: Or were we doing just TV themes?

24:41.845 --> 24:43.626
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, so old TV themes DWI.

24:43.827 --> 24:44.507
[SPEAKER_22]: No remixes.

24:45.087 --> 24:46.008
[SPEAKER_22]: Original TV themes.

24:47.392 --> 24:48.873
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to see some of those TV themes.

24:48.913 --> 24:50.955
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to see, like, Greatest American Hero.

24:51.115 --> 24:52.496
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to see Silver Spoons.

24:53.077 --> 24:54.098
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to see the A-Team.

24:54.218 --> 24:56.600
[SPEAKER_25]: If somebody did one to Small Wonder, that'd be crazy.

24:58.181 --> 25:00.543
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked for the Small Wonder theme to play on the pre-show, and I couldn't find it.

25:02.425 --> 25:06.969
[SPEAKER_22]: I've only got one TV theme that's actually into a DWI, and that's Nash Bridges' theme.

25:08.970 --> 25:09.991
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what one would be fun?

25:10.071 --> 25:11.612
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought of Bonanza.

25:12.313 --> 25:12.834
[SPEAKER_02]: Banana!

25:17.601 --> 25:19.163
[SPEAKER_02]: I AM A BANANA!

25:20.424 --> 25:22.646
[SPEAKER_13]: My food is too big!

25:22.686 --> 25:25.688
[SPEAKER_22]: You're watching a family emergency.

25:26.869 --> 25:28.591
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh... Yeah!

25:29.031 --> 25:30.452
[SPEAKER_25]: My guy... Airwolf!

25:30.853 --> 25:31.233
Yes!

25:32.154 --> 25:33.675
[SPEAKER_25]: No, no, I just had it.

25:33.755 --> 25:35.436
[SPEAKER_25]: The Price is Right would be a good one.

25:36.297 --> 25:39.960
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, the other one that I wanted to see... God, it was just in my brain.

25:40.221 --> 25:41.922
[SPEAKER_25]: The years of marijuana have fucked me up.

25:42.683 --> 25:42.743
[SPEAKER_25]: Um...

25:43.911 --> 25:44.991
[SPEAKER_25]: Batman would be pretty cool.

25:45.051 --> 25:45.652
[SPEAKER_25]: Batman would be cool.

25:45.672 --> 25:47.172
[SPEAKER_25]: They're throwing him out in the chat room now.

25:47.432 --> 25:48.573
[SPEAKER_25]: We got the chat room up here live.

25:48.953 --> 25:51.054
[SPEAKER_25]: If you had already joined the chat room, what server are they on?

25:53.675 --> 25:58.076
[SPEAKER_03]: It's otherside.irc.net.

25:58.116 --> 26:05.139
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go to orangelounge.skie.cx and there's a link there to our channel.

26:06.160 --> 26:12.582
[SPEAKER_25]: If you want one that's kind of a related TV hip-hop theme to New York undercover, kick-ass intro music, use that.

26:14.706 --> 26:18.308
[SPEAKER_22]: WKRP MASH

26:46.170 --> 27:04.255
[SPEAKER_18]: Baby, if you've ever wondered, wondered whatever became of me I'm living on the air in Cincinnati, Cincinnati, WKRP Got kinda tired of packing and unpacking, town to town, up and down the dial

27:17.178 --> 27:27.661
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's enough of that.

27:28.981 --> 27:31.102
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the WKRP in Cincinnati theme.

27:32.422 --> 27:32.782
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

27:32.982 --> 27:35.723
[SPEAKER_03]: I was, I don't know how old I was when that show was on.

27:35.803 --> 27:37.423
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, there's Shermie.

27:38.244 --> 27:39.244
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, she's back under bed.

27:40.171 --> 27:42.634
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeremy decided there were too many people downstairs and came up here.

27:43.835 --> 27:45.177
[SPEAKER_03]: Saved by the fucking bell.

27:45.817 --> 27:50.503
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what's-her-face-from-that-show went on to be in Showgirls and show her boobs and her ass to the world.

27:51.444 --> 27:52.285
[SPEAKER_22]: Elizabeth Berkley.

27:52.958 --> 27:54.679
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, so did Tiffany Amber Thiessen.

27:56.019 --> 27:57.340
[SPEAKER_22]: She's stupid, though.

27:57.360 --> 28:00.562
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know, a bunch of crap.

28:00.582 --> 28:01.782
[SPEAKER_22]: She was on Beverly Hills 90210.

28:02.883 --> 28:04.664
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sure she got naked at some point.

28:05.664 --> 28:06.084
[SPEAKER_22]: I know.

28:07.125 --> 28:07.585
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sure.

28:08.585 --> 28:09.366
[SPEAKER_22]: She's a slut.

28:10.486 --> 28:10.746
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

28:11.627 --> 28:13.928
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you were on Saved by the Bell, then you'd have to turn into a hoe.

28:14.248 --> 28:15.949
[SPEAKER_03]: You know Kim Fields was in a Bell Biff DeVoe video?

28:19.022 --> 28:19.623
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

28:38.059 --> 28:39.340
[SPEAKER_22]: And she's a slut in that one, too.

28:39.600 --> 28:49.486
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, she's willing to, like, have sex with, or she, you know, and you can tell that the character, it went through her mind that, you know, she was going to have sex with this, like, 16-year-old kid.

28:50.247 --> 28:52.908
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you know, she was a slut in that, too.

28:53.028 --> 28:54.329
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I don't know.

28:54.790 --> 28:55.370
[SPEAKER_22]: But she sucked.

28:57.291 --> 28:58.892
[SPEAKER_22]: Elizabeth, uh, Berkley.

28:59.352 --> 29:01.774
[SPEAKER_22]: She's played everything she's been, she's been like a slut.

29:02.659 --> 29:10.784
[SPEAKER_25]: Dude, okay, now, I admit she was hot back in the day on Saved by the Bell, okay, long way, you know, she was alright looking, even though she was, I don't know if she was brown or blonde back then, she was okay.

29:11.465 --> 29:15.267
[SPEAKER_25]: The thing that turned me off to Elizabeth Berkley was the pool scene in Showgirl.

29:15.327 --> 29:20.451
[SPEAKER_25]: Some of you remember this, I swear to God the woman was having a seizure because the light went bad in the freaking pool.

29:20.951 --> 29:22.833
[SPEAKER_25]: What the hell happened?

29:23.053 --> 29:26.275
[SPEAKER_25]: I've had, you know, I've been in bed a little bit.

29:26.295 --> 29:29.198
[SPEAKER_25]: I have not seen anybody have an orgasm like that.

29:29.238 --> 29:32.580
[SPEAKER_25]: If you have an orgasm like that, put a message out in the chat room.

29:32.781 --> 29:33.902
[SPEAKER_25]: That was scary.

29:34.022 --> 29:35.403
[SPEAKER_25]: I was afraid she was having a heart attack.

29:35.463 --> 29:36.323
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know what the hell happened.

29:37.364 --> 29:41.828
[SPEAKER_22]: She looked like a fucking shark grabbed onto his nuts, like, just thrashing in the water.

29:42.548 --> 29:43.329
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know, it was weird.

29:44.390 --> 29:46.692
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh my god, what the hell's going on?

29:46.972 --> 29:48.193
[SPEAKER_26]: What the hell was wrong with her?

29:48.914 --> 29:49.314
[SPEAKER_26]: God!

29:50.492 --> 29:52.736
[SPEAKER_22]: You fucked him without fucking him!

29:53.437 --> 29:53.878
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

29:54.318 --> 29:56.362
[SPEAKER_22]: You kind of have to fuck them in order to fuck them.

29:56.903 --> 29:58.766
[SPEAKER_22]: But if you weren't fucking them, how were you fucking them?

30:01.550 --> 30:02.932
[SPEAKER_03]: Last week on Orange Lounge Radio.

30:05.542 --> 30:06.883
[SPEAKER_22]: That whole movie is awful.

30:07.744 --> 30:09.765
[SPEAKER_22]: Every time I've watched it, I've fallen asleep.

30:10.586 --> 30:12.087
[SPEAKER_25]: Actually, scarier scene.

30:12.287 --> 30:13.188
[SPEAKER_25]: I just saw this movie.

30:13.768 --> 30:17.611
[SPEAKER_25]: I was watching it over at... Whose house was I just over at the other day, watching this?

30:18.111 --> 30:18.512
[SPEAKER_25]: Tony's.

30:18.652 --> 30:19.432
[SPEAKER_25]: My good friend Tony.

30:19.993 --> 30:21.474
[SPEAKER_25]: Kuno126, what's up to him?

30:22.275 --> 30:24.016
[SPEAKER_25]: Techie guy, represents Otaku Outpost.

30:24.396 --> 30:27.438
[SPEAKER_25]: We saw this movie, Yi Tu Mama Tamien.

30:27.518 --> 30:28.239
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, you've seen this!

30:28.919 --> 30:30.801
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, there's a scene in the movie!

30:30.821 --> 30:30.901
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay!

30:31.607 --> 30:33.049
[SPEAKER_25]: Two guys who are pretty close friends, right?

30:33.349 --> 30:35.451
[SPEAKER_25]: The movie gets wackier, so I still suggest you go out and see it.

30:36.973 --> 30:40.657
[SPEAKER_25]: One of their parents, okay, one of the kids is kind of rich, the other one's kind of poor, but this will get down.

30:40.677 --> 30:42.199
[SPEAKER_25]: I think the other kind of poor kid's middle class.

30:42.259 --> 30:43.860
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway, they're at a country club.

30:44.361 --> 30:45.082
[SPEAKER_25]: You know this scene.

30:45.322 --> 30:46.123
[SPEAKER_25]: They're at a country club.

30:47.064 --> 30:51.589
[SPEAKER_25]: They're on two opposite diving boards talking while they're, you know, fapping.

30:52.907 --> 30:55.548
[SPEAKER_25]: And it gets scarier because they go to a shot.

30:55.588 --> 30:59.249
[SPEAKER_25]: It's bad enough that you see them fapping on the two diving boards at this country club in public.

30:59.769 --> 31:03.570
[SPEAKER_25]: But the killer scene is when you see the spooge hit the water.

31:04.430 --> 31:05.891
[SPEAKER_26]: They put this scene in the movie.

31:06.311 --> 31:06.751
[SPEAKER_26]: Why?

31:07.051 --> 31:08.831
[SPEAKER_26]: I didn't want to see the spooge hit the water.

31:09.952 --> 31:10.992
[SPEAKER_26]: That's just not cool.

31:12.512 --> 31:13.973
[SPEAKER_03]: You're tuned in to KTMI.

31:14.713 --> 31:15.753
[SPEAKER_03]: Too much information radio.

31:17.254 --> 31:19.694
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, there was also the other scene where they started making out, too.

31:19.714 --> 31:22.135
[SPEAKER_22]: The two guys started making out when they were with the one chick.

31:22.714 --> 31:23.435
[SPEAKER_03]: I want that movie.

31:23.655 --> 31:24.715
[SPEAKER_03]: I like seeing guys make out.

31:25.056 --> 31:26.236
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you're saying?

31:28.018 --> 31:30.459
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't have a single problem with guys making out.

31:30.479 --> 31:35.703
[SPEAKER_25]: If a guy's cute enough, I'd probably make out with him, but... Okay, two guys making out, that's one thing.

31:36.163 --> 31:42.187
[SPEAKER_25]: But at that point in the movie, we didn't need to see, you know, they pretty much had it established they were pretty homophobic.

31:42.488 --> 31:44.649
[SPEAKER_25]: We did not need to see the spooge hit the water.

31:46.991 --> 31:47.971
[SPEAKER_25]: Melody's in here now.

31:48.032 --> 31:48.572
[SPEAKER_25]: Say hi, Melody.

31:49.858 --> 31:52.920
[SPEAKER_25]: And she just paused because she just came in as I said that, and now she's kind of shook.

31:55.921 --> 32:03.185
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps we should get back to 2DX and Beatmania and everything, right?

32:03.746 --> 32:07.288
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just having the image, that's mental image that I did not need.

32:07.928 --> 32:08.148
[SPEAKER_03]: Here.

32:09.689 --> 32:11.750
[SPEAKER_22]: I saw the whole movie, I just got bored with it too.

32:11.770 --> 32:12.891
[SPEAKER_22]: I was like, ah, it's foreign.

32:14.913 --> 32:15.173
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, man.

32:35.336 --> 32:36.618
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

32:52.610 --> 32:55.291
[SPEAKER_25]: We haven't had out anything besides Eurobeat songs on DDR.

32:55.312 --> 32:57.953
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm still waiting to find a machine that has the club mixes on it.

32:58.913 --> 33:02.215
[SPEAKER_25]: And, you know, I'd really like for them to open up the code to that, although I don't think they will.

33:02.275 --> 33:04.356
[SPEAKER_25]: It'd be kind of cool if I could make my own DDR mix.

33:05.716 --> 33:07.897
[SPEAKER_25]: There's tons of songs on there, but hey, you know, that's why.

33:08.017 --> 33:13.160
[SPEAKER_25]: But I'm glad that there's nothing going on, because nothing going on means people are playing rather than starting drama, and that's a beautiful thing.

33:13.460 --> 33:16.061
[SPEAKER_25]: Because that means that there's less stupid people that I have to slap.

33:17.302 --> 33:19.703
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, we're in the process of finding the code right now.

33:20.259 --> 33:22.420
[SPEAKER_22]: We have people working on it night and day.

33:23.721 --> 33:24.961
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, doing that kind of thing.

33:25.021 --> 33:28.443
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, I'm getting closer and closer to being able to rip more stuff out of there.

33:28.463 --> 33:33.025
[SPEAKER_22]: I just got a thing to rip videos out of PlayStation 2 Bomani games.

33:33.045 --> 33:37.667
[SPEAKER_22]: The problem is the program is Japanese, so I have no fucking clue what it wants me to do.

33:38.907 --> 33:39.888
[SPEAKER_22]: Is this a fuck you show?

33:41.148 --> 33:42.269
[SPEAKER_29]: No, this is a real show.

33:43.158 --> 33:44.458
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, darn.

33:44.478 --> 33:45.519
[SPEAKER_29]: We're going to do the Fikus later.

33:45.979 --> 33:49.260
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, I'll save it for then because I don't want to mess up anything.

33:49.960 --> 33:52.261
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura was cruising a really cool place.com.

33:52.281 --> 33:54.462
[SPEAKER_25]: My boy Government went to that.

33:54.822 --> 34:00.184
[SPEAKER_25]: I met him shortly after the destruction at MGL thanks to Changeo, Phoenix, and a bunch of other crazy MFs.

34:00.864 --> 34:03.185
[SPEAKER_25]: So go to that site, bmox.com, if you haven't already went there.

34:03.205 --> 34:04.445
[SPEAKER_25]: Actually, I think Phoenix is doing...

34:05.277 --> 34:29.651
[SPEAKER_22]: information gathering and news for them now too, really cool guy down in LA what's up to him and JustJay, Envision, other heads down there, Supply, Jobson, whatever the hell he is well it looks like, as far as new stuff coming out it looks like Guitar Freak's 9th and Drum Mania 8th are supposed to be coming out next month you're going to have Beat Mania 7th and the final coming out to Playstation 2

34:30.894 --> 34:33.779
[SPEAKER_25]: So is that Beatmania 7th the final mix for Beatmania?

34:33.820 --> 34:36.424
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'm assuming that everything is going to be stepped up to 2DX after that?

34:38.454 --> 34:41.615
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, yeah, it's pretty much, it's the final and, um, segment.

34:41.995 --> 34:43.255
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello, I totally forgot.

34:43.736 --> 34:47.217
[SPEAKER_22]: Another, um, DDR Extreme code was released this week.

34:47.937 --> 34:51.578
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, unlocking a couple more non-stop courses and more Oni courses.

34:52.058 --> 34:59.220
[SPEAKER_22]: Including in those, um, Oni courses, they've got, you know, Sakura as one of the playable songs in one of the Oni courses.

34:59.600 --> 35:02.521
[SPEAKER_22]: Along with, um, let's see what else, Xenon is in one of them.

35:03.181 --> 35:05.804
[SPEAKER_22]: and Dance Dance Revolution is in one of them.

35:06.124 --> 35:10.568
[SPEAKER_22]: And finally, in one of the non-subcourses, Heaven is... What was it?

35:12.109 --> 35:12.389
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

35:13.030 --> 35:16.293
[SPEAKER_22]: Heaven is 57 gray or... I forget the fucking song.

35:17.882 --> 35:23.466
[SPEAKER_25]: Honestly, if you are looking, I don't know how many heads haven't wanted to play it.

35:23.606 --> 35:26.728
[SPEAKER_25]: If you haven't had a chance to play it yet, please go out and play Guitar Freaks.

35:26.788 --> 35:28.949
[SPEAKER_25]: It's an excellent game, and I feel it's kind of been slept on.

35:28.969 --> 35:38.335
[SPEAKER_25]: There are a few people, you know, most people don't go beyond DDR and I'd say Beatmania, but if you have to expand to another element, definitely go with Guitar Freaks.

35:38.395 --> 35:39.996
[SPEAKER_25]: It's one of the most fun games I've had.

35:40.316 --> 35:41.777
[SPEAKER_25]: Dance Mania X is another fun one.

35:41.817 --> 35:45.159
[SPEAKER_25]: Islander just mentioned that, but Guitar Freaks is one of my favorites.

35:45.699 --> 35:58.563
[SPEAKER_25]: And then later, earlier this week, I got to play more Cusar, because that was fun.

36:00.744 --> 36:01.144
[SPEAKER_29]: Same place?

36:02.345 --> 36:03.145
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, same place.

36:03.265 --> 36:05.246
[SPEAKER_22]: Played on the fifth mix in Max 2 again.

36:05.586 --> 36:07.286
[SPEAKER_22]: That fifth mix is fucked up.

36:08.107 --> 36:08.567
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my god.

36:09.327 --> 36:10.768
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just, all the pads don't work.

36:11.408 --> 36:11.748
[SPEAKER_22]: That's it.

36:12.890 --> 36:20.332
[SPEAKER_25]: Nothing sucks more than when you go to an arcade and you've already dealt with somebody who's been talking to a gang of shit, and you can't kick their ass because the machine sucks.

36:22.833 --> 36:23.133
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

36:23.633 --> 36:24.033
[SPEAKER_22]: What's that?

36:27.794 --> 36:28.034
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

36:28.415 --> 36:28.675
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

36:29.435 --> 36:35.096
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, guys, I'm really sorry, and thank you so much for bearing with me on this.

36:35.217 --> 36:36.777
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go ahead and get... Oh, here, you talk.

36:37.981 --> 36:39.082
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't bear with us.

36:39.663 --> 36:42.045
[SPEAKER_22]: You're privileged to be listening to us.

36:42.826 --> 36:46.810
[SPEAKER_22]: You will deal with any hardships that you... Yeah.

36:47.611 --> 36:47.951
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

36:48.452 --> 36:48.892
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me that.

36:49.273 --> 36:50.734
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm going to a break.

39:15.913 --> 39:19.645
You're a New York City boy, so young, so wild, in a New York City

43:43.599 --> 44:00.434
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, Joey Strick joined one Before there were words, communication was done through feet Body language is controlled by rhythm Music is the universal league Feel this, feel these, uh

44:43.420 --> 45:02.231

45:17.364 --> 45:18.045

45:18.085 --> 45:18.926
[SPEAKER_11]: Where you going?

45:18.987 --> 45:21.131
[SPEAKER_11]: Just follow the beat, come on y'all!

47:14.156 --> 47:15.958
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

47:16.138 --> 47:18.661
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Bongo demands it.

47:21.324 --> 47:22.185
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay, we're back.

47:23.106 --> 47:25.548
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on drink number four, which is more of that chocolate.

47:26.669 --> 47:29.372
[SPEAKER_03]: It's vanilla soy milk and Godiva liqueur.

47:29.853 --> 47:30.593
[SPEAKER_03]: How is it, Melody?

47:32.756 --> 47:33.957
[SPEAKER_28]: It's gone now.

47:34.077 --> 47:34.978
[SPEAKER_28]: I already drank it.

47:35.058 --> 47:36.520
[SPEAKER_28]: It's really yummy, actually.

47:37.438 --> 47:53.466
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm about to work on that drink myself, I'm working through a mixture of apple juice and sky vodka right now, so it's good, it's good stuff, I already had two with amp in it, so I'm getting kind of, oh wait, she's sampling the drink now, I'm getting kind of bent, we just came from a terrific, what was the name of the sushi spot we went to?

47:55.827 --> 47:58.348
[SPEAKER_28]: Dang, that is good, that's a really yummy drink.

47:59.989 --> 48:00.449
[SPEAKER_26]: Ross!

48:02.611 --> 48:03.011
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck!

48:03.171 --> 48:05.372
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, we don't know, no, the other one.

48:07.415 --> 48:32.915
[SPEAKER_25]: Toonari, if you're ever in Sacramento, go to Toonari Sushi, good stuff Right by DarkSakura's house, you can come be on Orange Lounge Radio too, if you're cool Um, we're all drinking except for our designated host Yeah, I'm staying sober, so I can be boring I gotta, you know, I have to be the dull end of the show Loki, I mean, are you straight or anything, Loki?

48:32.935 --> 48:34.216
[SPEAKER_25]: Do you drink normally or what's going on?

48:35.117 --> 48:35.978
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I don't drink normally

48:37.344 --> 48:38.344
[SPEAKER_25]: Any particular reason?

48:39.865 --> 48:42.465
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I think I'll probably get violent and hurt people.

48:44.145 --> 48:45.406
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, that's cool.

48:45.586 --> 48:46.466
[SPEAKER_25]: Angry drunks suck.

48:46.506 --> 48:47.306
[SPEAKER_25]: I've only experienced two.

48:47.326 --> 48:48.766
[SPEAKER_25]: Don't come around me if you're an angry drunk.

48:49.687 --> 48:53.127
[SPEAKER_03]: What we need to do is get you entirely shit-faced and take you to Golf Land.

48:55.528 --> 48:56.188
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, actually, no.

48:56.208 --> 48:58.329
[SPEAKER_25]: We don't want to get him shit-faced and take him to a strip bar.

48:58.389 --> 48:59.289
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, Golf Land would be good.

49:00.349 --> 49:02.689
[SPEAKER_03]: So he can murder all the silly, stupid Roosevelt children.

49:04.270 --> 49:05.170
[SPEAKER_22]: Get video of that.

49:07.072 --> 49:08.973
[SPEAKER_03]: I would pay money to see that.

49:12.315 --> 49:13.696
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Mongo Child does rock.

49:14.757 --> 49:18.199
[SPEAKER_03]: Melody and I have had Mongo Child two days in a row at the same place in Roseville.

49:19.099 --> 49:20.260
[SPEAKER_03]: At Great Wall in Roseville.

49:20.600 --> 49:22.582
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, hi, say hi.

49:23.302 --> 49:23.622
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

49:24.443 --> 49:25.443
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Iguana Girl.

49:25.463 --> 49:26.584
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, wee!

49:27.364 --> 49:28.525
[SPEAKER_03]: She's been playing Animal Crack.

49:32.007 --> 49:34.849
[SPEAKER_03]: She's another one of our designated people.

49:37.319 --> 49:58.475
[SPEAKER_25]: because the rest of us are well on our way I can stop playing the game as soon as I pay off another 500,000 bells I'm waiting for the first report in the news from Animal Crossing that somebody ran into somebody on accident or had a speeding violation because they were waiting to get home to do something in Animal Crossing

49:59.491 --> 50:08.338
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, I have actually seen spots on the road that are like potholes or whatever that look like the little star in Animal Crossing, and the first thing that crossed my mind was, I need to get my shovel and dig it up.

50:09.418 --> 50:11.320
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a serious addiction problem here.

50:11.340 --> 50:13.802
[SPEAKER_25]: We're trying to get Melody and Jessica into a 12-step.

50:14.542 --> 50:17.224
[SPEAKER_25]: We're working on that, but we haven't managed to do it today.

50:19.145 --> 50:19.466
[SPEAKER_22]: You see?

50:21.716 --> 50:37.451
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, I almost, you know, I used to be like, no, I actually never really was like that, but, you know, sure, I'd want to get back, you know, so I could do shit on Animal Crossing, but that was until I learned about the wonders of turning back the internal clock, into which case you could play days before and that kind of fun stuff.

50:38.372 --> 50:44.238
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm on the LiveJournal Animal Crossing community, and one person will actually refer to that as clock fondling.

50:45.059 --> 50:46.020
[SPEAKER_28]: Greatest term ever.

50:47.464 --> 50:49.066
[SPEAKER_25]: See, here's my problem with Animal Crossing.

50:49.346 --> 50:51.128
[SPEAKER_25]: There's not enough violence in the damn game.

50:51.448 --> 50:53.030
[SPEAKER_25]: For example, Tom Nook.

50:53.150 --> 50:56.473
[SPEAKER_25]: That son of a bitch needs to get a bullet right between the eyes for how rude he is.

50:56.774 --> 50:57.795
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sick of that shit.

50:58.175 --> 51:04.201
[SPEAKER_25]: Every time I've seen somebody go to that goddamn store, that asshole sits there, okay, oh, you want to come into my store?

51:04.721 --> 51:09.186
[SPEAKER_25]: You need to be able to snatch him from behind the counter and beat his ass in that game for being an asshole.

51:09.566 --> 51:10.127
[SPEAKER_25]: Sick of this.

51:11.548 --> 51:14.650
[SPEAKER_22]: He's like a little Chinese woman that's running the store.

51:15.251 --> 51:15.431
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh!

51:16.492 --> 51:16.652
Oh!

51:16.832 --> 51:17.653
[SPEAKER_22]: You want product?

51:17.713 --> 51:18.333
[SPEAKER_22]: You want product?

51:18.713 --> 51:22.116
[SPEAKER_22]: And then you go upstairs and there's like two and it's like, oh my god!

51:22.136 --> 51:23.297
[SPEAKER_22]: He spit two!

51:25.038 --> 51:25.979
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, that was dirty.

51:26.579 --> 51:27.319
[SPEAKER_25]: That was dirty.

51:27.760 --> 51:28.640
[SPEAKER_25]: But that's the truth, man.

51:28.660 --> 51:29.481
[SPEAKER_25]: You need a punch button.

51:29.501 --> 51:35.345
[SPEAKER_25]: See, if it was GTA 3 Vice City, somebody pisses you off, you pull a shotgun out and fucking erase their ass.

51:35.365 --> 51:38.387
[SPEAKER_25]: In Animal Crossing, you gotta run around because it's one of those happy Nintendo games.

51:38.748 --> 51:39.268
[SPEAKER_25]: Screw this!

51:39.508 --> 51:40.009
[SPEAKER_25]: I want Animal...

51:40.970 --> 51:42.110
[SPEAKER_28]: You just hit them with a bug net.

51:42.190 --> 51:42.871
[SPEAKER_28]: There you go.

51:42.931 --> 51:46.472
[SPEAKER_25]: I wanna have an Animal Crossing where you can just hit somebody in the head with a fucking bat.

51:47.172 --> 51:49.572
[SPEAKER_25]: Animal Crossing 3, the carnage begins.

51:49.832 --> 51:50.653
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what I want.

51:50.693 --> 51:52.073
[SPEAKER_25]: Nintendo, make the game.

51:54.574 --> 51:56.134
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, Jessica didn't wanna say anything.

51:56.434 --> 51:58.855
[SPEAKER_25]: But I say more violence in Animal Crossing.

51:59.135 --> 51:59.835
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what I want.

51:59.915 --> 52:01.556
[SPEAKER_25]: I want shovels to the back of the head.

52:01.936 --> 52:02.896
[SPEAKER_25]: I want hatchets.

52:03.176 --> 52:04.056
[SPEAKER_25]: I want meat cleavers.

52:04.076 --> 52:04.777
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what I want.

52:05.397 --> 52:06.077
[SPEAKER_29]: I have to pee.

52:07.711 --> 52:14.378
[SPEAKER_22]: No, what I don't understand is, okay, the store carries four types of paper, and no Nintendo games.

52:14.658 --> 52:15.899
[SPEAKER_22]: What the hell is up with that?

52:16.420 --> 52:17.260
[SPEAKER_25]: See, that's some other shit.

52:17.300 --> 52:20.243
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck that game because it doesn't have all the best Nintendo games of all time.

52:20.544 --> 52:23.466
[SPEAKER_25]: Where's my goddamn copy of River City Ransom and Animal Crossing?

52:23.506 --> 52:26.770
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, it's not Nintendo proprietary, but I don't give a fuck.

52:26.990 --> 52:27.951
[SPEAKER_25]: That game was the shit.

52:30.323 --> 52:32.285
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to hit someone's upside the head with a shovel.

52:32.406 --> 52:33.047
[SPEAKER_24]: That's right.

52:33.607 --> 52:34.168
That's right.

52:34.208 --> 52:34.649
[SPEAKER_25]: That's right.

52:34.669 --> 52:36.872
[SPEAKER_25]: Hear the ping noise of a toddler's head in the Robin's store.

52:37.172 --> 52:38.034
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck that bastard.

52:39.594 --> 52:45.438
[SPEAKER_22]: That and those stupid twins, and they sell like the stupidest shit, I mean like the, what was it, floating asteroid?

52:45.739 --> 52:48.020
[SPEAKER_22]: What the hell do I need a floating asteroid for my house for?

52:48.601 --> 52:50.302
[SPEAKER_26]: Plus, you know who else I'm gonna bust the cap in?

52:50.542 --> 52:54.525
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm gonna personally stab in the eye at stupid bitch Phyllis at the motherfucking post office.

52:54.886 --> 52:57.127
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't give a fuck if you're a postal worker, you rude bitch.

52:57.387 --> 53:02.331
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll come in there and strangle you at night, and then dance on your fucking corpse like Marishnikov, you dumb bitch.

53:02.611 --> 53:04.253
[SPEAKER_26]: Every single time I'm gonna fucking go see...

53:04.953 --> 53:11.875
[SPEAKER_26]: Every single time a motherfucker goes in there, another customer, FUCK YOU, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO YOUR GODDAMN JOB, YOU STUPID BITCH, DIE!

53:13.276 --> 53:14.836
[SPEAKER_26]: Rose doesn't want the goddamn mic.

53:16.197 --> 53:17.617
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm too busy laughing.

53:18.918 --> 53:20.158
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll stab that bitch in the eye.

53:21.716 --> 53:22.096
[SPEAKER_22]: What was it?

53:22.256 --> 53:22.537
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

53:23.537 --> 53:23.958
[SPEAKER_22]: I saw this.

53:24.118 --> 53:25.719
[SPEAKER_22]: There's one animal in our town, Lucy.

53:25.779 --> 53:27.780
[SPEAKER_22]: She has the backyard theme in her house.

53:28.340 --> 53:29.001
[SPEAKER_22]: What the fuck?

53:29.241 --> 53:31.302
[SPEAKER_22]: Why make your house look like your backyard?

53:31.883 --> 53:32.723
[SPEAKER_22]: That's the dumbest thing.

53:32.923 --> 53:34.064
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to live in my backyard.

53:34.724 --> 53:35.945
[SPEAKER_22]: Because you're a fucking retard.

53:36.245 --> 53:36.746
[SPEAKER_25]: Another thing.

53:37.006 --> 53:40.988
[SPEAKER_25]: Iguana Girl, perfectly peaceful player, was going around today doing errands around people.

53:41.309 --> 53:42.429
[SPEAKER_25]: What was the name of that dumb bitch?

53:43.390 --> 53:44.751
[SPEAKER_25]: Start with a P. Ears.

53:45.856 --> 53:46.236
[SPEAKER_26]: Pippi!

53:46.676 --> 53:48.197
[SPEAKER_26]: That dumb bitch needs to die, too!

53:48.437 --> 53:50.518
[SPEAKER_26]: She went up to her and just asked a simple question, do you have any jobs?

53:50.758 --> 53:54.279
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, no, I actually don't, and I'm gonna take some of your shit, because you can't do anything about it!

53:55.159 --> 53:55.460
[SPEAKER_26]: No!

53:55.680 --> 53:57.280
[SPEAKER_26]: Hit her in the head with a fucking shovel!

53:57.760 --> 53:58.501
[SPEAKER_26]: I want debt!

53:59.901 --> 54:06.744
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, back on the entire theme of weird houses, I don't remember who it is, but someone has a freaking bathroom.

54:07.084 --> 54:11.625
[SPEAKER_28]: There's a bunch of exotic screens and toilets behind them all, and a plant and a garbage can.

54:11.705 --> 54:12.986
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a freaking bathroom!

54:13.346 --> 54:14.667
[SPEAKER_28]: That's what I want in my house.

54:15.087 --> 54:16.367
[SPEAKER_28]: Make it a public toilet.

54:17.128 --> 54:18.088
[SPEAKER_28]: Greatest room ever.

54:18.748 --> 54:22.110
[SPEAKER_25]: Because the greatest thing you can have in your house in Animal Crossing is a porta potty.

54:23.910 --> 54:25.451
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, we're missing The Simpsons.

54:25.871 --> 54:27.152
[SPEAKER_22]: The 300th episode.

54:29.653 --> 54:30.093
[SPEAKER_22]: No cable.

54:31.129 --> 54:41.491
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want the bathroom theme in your house, by the way, all you need is six toilets, the exotic screen, the exotic wall, the plaza tile, the trash can, and I think a cone.

54:42.172 --> 54:43.572
[SPEAKER_03]: And a plant.

54:43.712 --> 54:45.672
[SPEAKER_03]: And sadly enough, I remember what each of the items are.

54:46.673 --> 54:52.714
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I really want to relive the experience of going to San Francisco and trying to find a public bathroom to use after getting drunk, you know?

54:53.294 --> 54:56.555
[SPEAKER_25]: Nothing sticks out to me like trying to walk over the feces on the floor.

54:57.355 --> 55:00.336
[SPEAKER_25]: And, you know, I really want that public bathroom theme in there.

55:00.356 --> 55:00.656
[SPEAKER_25]: What the heck?

55:02.376 --> 55:03.377
[SPEAKER_25]: Ross is still done.

55:04.457 --> 55:05.858
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a fireplace, by the way.

55:09.180 --> 55:10.301
[SPEAKER_03]: He's holding Charmander.

55:10.701 --> 55:11.482
[SPEAKER_03]: Char!

55:11.802 --> 55:12.442
[SPEAKER_03]: Char!

55:13.143 --> 55:20.467
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of Pokemon, by the way, I'm going to be playing something for everybody.

55:21.248 --> 55:22.068
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on for a second.

55:22.108 --> 55:23.449
[SPEAKER_03]: Josh, talk to everybody for a minute.

55:24.130 --> 55:24.850
[SPEAKER_25]: What do you want me to do?

55:26.311 --> 55:29.312
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, um, okay, well, hey.

55:29.972 --> 55:31.813
[SPEAKER_25]: What was, they thought it was funny, I think.

55:31.853 --> 55:33.654
[SPEAKER_25]: I wonder if everybody in the chat room thought it was funny.

55:34.254 --> 55:34.634
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

55:34.954 --> 55:38.676
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh, regardless, uh, DarkSakura's loading up a sea of goodness for you guys.

55:38.916 --> 55:39.616
[SPEAKER_25]: Ross is chilling here.

55:39.636 --> 55:41.117
[SPEAKER_25]: We're throwing around a Charmander.

55:41.397 --> 55:43.458
[SPEAKER_25]: Squirrel's personally my favorite Pokemon, even though I don't like it.

55:44.718 --> 55:47.379
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, Charmander was molesting Melody's boob.

55:48.020 --> 55:51.441
[SPEAKER_25]: Mel's gonna have to beat the Charmanders, and now the Charmander's giving Ross head.

55:53.786 --> 55:58.009
[SPEAKER_25]: It's working it like Mariah Carey trying to go for a second record contract at Sony right now.

55:59.751 --> 56:04.534
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of Pokemon, I've been collecting a CD series called Pada Pada Max.

56:05.955 --> 56:07.556
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the Japanese Pokemon theme.

56:08.297 --> 56:10.098
[SPEAKER_26]: It ain't the Easter Bunny, motherfucker!

56:10.739 --> 56:12.660
[SPEAKER_03]: From the Pada Pada Max 3 CD.

56:13.381 --> 56:16.043
[SPEAKER_03]: So enjoy the Eurobeat Pokemon groove.

56:17.384 --> 56:19.265
[SPEAKER_03]: Animal Crossing Mookie Bar my ass.

56:19.966 --> 56:20.106
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

58:02.699 --> 58:03.500
[SPEAKER_13]: Oops!

58:03.600 --> 58:03.840
[SPEAKER_13]: My bad!

58:03.960 --> 58:04.000
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

58:32.583 --> 58:34.745
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we have our Eurobeat hater in here.

58:36.966 --> 58:37.867
[SPEAKER_22]: Yay, it's over!

58:38.007 --> 58:39.368
[SPEAKER_22]: It's Pokemon and Eurobeat.

58:39.408 --> 58:40.189
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like evil.

58:41.770 --> 58:42.150
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

58:43.491 --> 58:45.093
[SPEAKER_22]: I was able to ignore the whole song.

58:45.473 --> 58:46.073
[SPEAKER_22]: That was great.

58:48.856 --> 58:49.876
[SPEAKER_22]: Yay, Digimon.

58:51.317 --> 58:59.364
[SPEAKER_22]: Worst remix ever has to be the, uh, that, what was it, uh, uh, AM, what was it?

59:00.794 --> 59:01.074
[SPEAKER_22]: A.M.

59:01.154 --> 59:02.415
[SPEAKER_22]: Groove 2001.

59:02.756 --> 59:04.597
[SPEAKER_22]: Holy shit, awful remix.

59:05.258 --> 59:05.758
[SPEAKER_22]: Awful remix.

59:05.778 --> 59:09.321
[SPEAKER_22]: Probably just like that Legend of Max 300 Unlimited crap.

59:09.741 --> 59:11.703
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, no, Legend of Max Unlimited 300.

59:12.844 --> 59:15.566
[SPEAKER_22]: Stupid friggin' sim file.

59:16.127 --> 59:18.989
[SPEAKER_22]: In fact, you can't even download it because the URL is broken.

59:21.371 --> 59:23.753
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as my CD is friggin' recognized, there we go.

59:23.773 --> 59:23.813
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

59:27.600 --> 59:33.068
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm gonna play something that if you've seen any of the Japanese Digimon, you'll recognize.

59:33.289 --> 59:34.150
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a short track.

59:34.871 --> 59:35.692
[SPEAKER_03]: So, here you go.

59:37.575 --> 59:38.156
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, eventually.

59:50.293 --> 59:52.355
Lalalala lalalala lalalala

01:00:34.444 --> 01:00:36.026
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching.

01:00:36.046 --> 01:00:37.127
[SPEAKER_14]: See you next time.

01:01:01.138 --> 01:01:03.301
[SPEAKER_14]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:01:37.711 --> 01:01:39.111
[SPEAKER_03]: There, was that better than Pokemon?

01:01:39.631 --> 01:01:40.191
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

01:01:40.652 --> 01:01:42.592
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're gonna, we should go to our fav- Pokemon!

01:01:43.172 --> 01:01:43.552
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

01:01:44.012 --> 01:01:47.653
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should go to our favorite part of the show, the fuckies of the week!

01:01:48.033 --> 01:01:49.313
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

01:01:49.473 --> 01:01:52.434
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay!

01:01:53.254 --> 01:01:54.194
[SPEAKER_03]: The fuckies of the week.

01:01:54.634 --> 01:01:56.415
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, I usually explain to you, it's your turn.

01:01:58.375 --> 01:01:59.835
[SPEAKER_22]: This is where we get ranty.

01:02:00.415 --> 01:02:02.976
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh wait, this is just another part of the show.

01:02:03.726 --> 01:02:13.412
[SPEAKER_22]: This is where every week we take time to do a shout out to all those people that piss us off and all the things that inconvenience us because we're better than everyone else.

01:02:15.574 --> 01:02:16.154
[SPEAKER_22]: That's about it.

01:02:17.975 --> 01:02:32.425
[SPEAKER_03]: So, because, again, I can't play music in the background, we're going to go to a brief break so all of you can PM me, yes, private message, or you can email orangechallengeradio at yahoo.com and tell us about what pisses you off.

01:02:33.078 --> 01:02:42.063
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to say fuck you to somebody, but you're too much of a wuss to do it yourself, tell us, and we'll say it for you, because we don't give a fuck.

01:02:42.403 --> 01:02:53.910
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just going to go ahead and play some of our usual fuck you theme songs, and then we'll come back and be angsty.

01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:54.671
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

01:06:00.073 --> 01:06:00.626
Thanks for watching!

01:07:41.109 --> 01:07:45.791
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that was our music for Fuck You's of the Week.

01:07:46.131 --> 01:07:50.773
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll go ahead and start with Loki for our angstiness.

01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:11.301
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, I'm so thrown off without music.

01:08:13.702 --> 01:08:14.002
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

01:08:15.722 --> 01:08:16.342
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, God.

01:08:16.363 --> 01:08:26.986
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, no, see, um, I really only have, I don't have, I think I had FUs earlier this week, but, like, I've just been bored over the weekend, so I kind of forgot it.

01:08:27.286 --> 01:08:28.587
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyways, I have two.

01:08:29.227 --> 01:08:31.027
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, start off with LessAnxiety1.

01:08:31.347 --> 01:08:35.629
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, FU to Acid3.0 for constantly crashing on me.

01:08:36.649 --> 01:08:41.751
[SPEAKER_22]: and at least I'm smart enough to save every now and then, but the thing keeps freezing up on me and that sucks.

01:08:42.391 --> 01:08:43.732
[SPEAKER_22]: So, yeah, F you to that.

01:08:43.972 --> 01:08:49.674
[SPEAKER_22]: And, uh, F you to freaking stupid old people with the handicap license plates, okay?

01:08:49.714 --> 01:09:00.218
[SPEAKER_22]: Just because you're fucking crippled because you got shot in the ass in Vietnam or whatever, you don't need to be driving 30 miles an hour slower than everyone else and you take up the closed parking spaces and you walk slow and you suck.

01:09:02.566 --> 01:09:10.552
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you know, I think what should actually happen is, because, you know, a lot of these people with handicapped bumper stickers, you know, I see, they're not hobbling enough.

01:09:10.933 --> 01:09:18.619
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to take, you know, their fucking wheelchair and just like, you know, go over the back of their spine with it, you know, just, you know, make sure that they're crippled just enough.

01:09:18.999 --> 01:09:24.683
[SPEAKER_22]: Because, what the hell, okay, if you're really crippled and you're driving a car, that's like driving a car blind.

01:09:24.884 --> 01:09:26.685
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I don't know.

01:09:27.666 --> 01:09:31.729
[SPEAKER_22]: I hate old people and I hate them with the stupid, yeah, stickers.

01:09:32.634 --> 01:09:35.956
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like the people who are not handicapped and have handicapped stickers.

01:09:37.356 --> 01:09:41.538
[SPEAKER_03]: Who just have them, or like borrow some family members just so they can get a front parking spot.

01:09:42.839 --> 01:09:43.359
[SPEAKER_03]: That would work.

01:09:43.879 --> 01:09:46.020
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, is that your fuck you's of the week?

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:46.260
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:09:49.201 --> 01:09:50.522
[SPEAKER_25]: Ah shit, they passed it to me.

01:09:51.403 --> 01:09:56.429
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, first of all, fuck you to everybody who's involved in like the mainstream hip-hop community right now.

01:09:56.750 --> 01:10:01.635
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sick of all you bastards who put out a fucking song and then put it out six months later as a goddamn remix.

01:10:01.715 --> 01:10:04.779
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't care if Mariah Carey's singing on it, it sucks dick anyway.

01:10:05.099 --> 01:10:11.467
[SPEAKER_25]: You fooboo-clad, stereotypical motherfuckers can almost suck my motherfucking, I'll battle you for your fucking title, dick.

01:10:11.827 --> 01:10:24.791
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sick of all this shit, you motherfuckers talk shit all over MTV, every five minutes, will not freestyle, battle anybody worth a shit, and I'll go on record and say this, 50 Cent sounds like Mike Tyson with Down Syndrome, but he's supposed to be the hot sack out there?

01:10:25.171 --> 01:10:25.731
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck you!

01:10:26.091 --> 01:10:38.535
[SPEAKER_25]: All these motherfuckers in the underground who've tried year after year after year to get put on, can't get put on because all of you fucking cock-sucking bastards up at MTV won't put on anything except for Real World and anything that'll get a fucking fashion brand out there.

01:10:38.835 --> 01:10:40.375
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck all you fascist bitches.

01:10:40.655 --> 01:10:47.337
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck all the goddamn stupid ass students at my fucking school who will not listen to me when they're in class and sit in the back of the class and don't do shit.

01:10:47.637 --> 01:10:50.257
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sitting there, I give you 13 pages of notes to pass the test.

01:10:50.557 --> 01:10:51.758
[SPEAKER_25]: You can't even read that shit.

01:10:51.798 --> 01:10:55.358
[SPEAKER_25]: Learn something besides all the members of B2K, you stupid motherfuckers.

01:10:55.798 --> 01:11:04.180
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck the president of North Korea because this dumbass shouldn't be building nuclear weapons when he can't spell blockbuster even though he has a fucking collection the size of a small state.

01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:07.664
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, motherfucker, everybody in Oakland is fucking stereotypical.

01:11:07.945 --> 01:11:13.532
[SPEAKER_25]: Motherfuck all the wannabe gangbangers in Fremont and Haywood who don't have anything better to do than try to be wannabe gangbangers.

01:11:14.153 --> 01:11:16.717
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, I don't know about everything out there, but I'll figure out some shit.

01:11:16.797 --> 01:11:17.938
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck all y'all motherfuckers.

01:11:21.102 --> 01:11:21.763
[SPEAKER_22]: Say that again.

01:11:22.572 --> 01:11:30.982
[SPEAKER_22]: There was a line that I heard from, it was from Clone High, it's all, he's talking to like the dark organization or whatever, like these people that want him to clone people.

01:11:31.302 --> 01:11:33.705
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyways, he's all, so we should go to the Olive Garden.

01:11:33.805 --> 01:11:37.229
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like eating in a giant kitchen of an Italian cliché.

01:11:39.591 --> 01:11:40.152
[SPEAKER_13]: That's great.

01:11:42.259 --> 01:11:45.084
[SPEAKER_26]: and motherfuck Taco Bell because they don't use real meat.

01:11:45.344 --> 01:11:47.308
[SPEAKER_26]: Del Taco owns you, bitch.

01:11:49.031 --> 01:11:50.573
[SPEAKER_22]: And Del Taco makes me feel sick.

01:11:51.054 --> 01:11:55.642
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, and F you to the freaking, what was it, that show Hot or Not.

01:11:58.243 --> 01:12:02.106
[SPEAKER_22]: You ripped off a fucking website, you're calling it your own, then you fucking botched the whole thing.

01:12:02.226 --> 01:12:03.447
[SPEAKER_22]: And who do you have on the show?

01:12:03.467 --> 01:12:08.931
[SPEAKER_22]: You have Lorenzo Llamas on there, and he's like saying, I don't like women with fake breasts.

01:12:09.091 --> 01:12:13.354
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh wait, I was married to one at one point, but I don't like women with fake breasts.

01:12:14.495 --> 01:12:17.217
[SPEAKER_25]: It's like Anna Nicole Smith saying she has good taste in makeup.

01:12:21.627 --> 01:12:40.098
[SPEAKER_27]: I'd just like to say a massive fuck you to every single goddamn person who waits until the fucking last minute to buy their Sherry's Berries so that they can get something special for their loved one and they wait until the day of so that they can say, oh, can you deliver this for me today?

01:12:40.338 --> 01:12:41.519
[SPEAKER_27]: No, fuck you.

01:12:42.259 --> 01:12:43.680
[SPEAKER_27]: We did everything through FedEx.

01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:44.961
[SPEAKER_27]: You're too goddamn late.

01:12:45.181 --> 01:12:47.182
[SPEAKER_27]: Go to the store and wait in line like everybody else.

01:12:47.662 --> 01:12:48.423
[SPEAKER_27]: So fuck you people.

01:12:52.954 --> 01:12:54.655
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't really have any right now.

01:12:54.715 --> 01:12:56.077
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm too happy and drunk.

01:12:58.879 --> 01:13:00.321
[SPEAKER_25]: Hang on, we're seeing if Ross doesn't fuck you.

01:13:00.741 --> 01:13:01.602
[SPEAKER_25]: Ross doesn't have a fuck you.

01:13:04.164 --> 01:13:05.025
[SPEAKER_25]: I got another fuck you.

01:13:05.425 --> 01:13:08.228
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck Sega for stopping making Dreamcast.

01:13:08.728 --> 01:13:10.130
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not buying another game from you.

01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:12.091
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll be burning your shit on the internet happily.

01:13:12.352 --> 01:13:15.775
[SPEAKER_25]: I will never pay for another Dreamcast game because you bastards didn't support the system.

01:13:16.015 --> 01:13:16.616
[SPEAKER_25]: Kiss my ass.

01:13:17.616 --> 01:13:17.937
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually...

01:13:19.054 --> 01:13:21.595
[SPEAKER_03]: Sega would not be in existence if they continued to support the system.

01:13:21.615 --> 01:13:22.295
[SPEAKER_03]: They would be bankrupt.

01:13:22.315 --> 01:13:23.035
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you kidding me?

01:13:23.275 --> 01:13:23.995
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not kidding you.

01:13:25.015 --> 01:13:25.175
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

01:13:25.475 --> 01:13:29.576
[SPEAKER_03]: They stopped producing the Dreamcast and stopped supporting it so that they could stay alive as a company.

01:13:29.856 --> 01:13:31.537
[SPEAKER_03]: We would not have any more Sonic Team games.

01:13:31.557 --> 01:13:37.278
[SPEAKER_03]: We would not have any new Knights, no new Sonic, no nothing, if they hadn't stopped their production of the Dreamcast.

01:13:37.378 --> 01:13:39.238
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I would just let you know that.

01:13:39.878 --> 01:13:40.918
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you retract your fuck you now?

01:13:41.199 --> 01:13:41.499
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

01:13:41.879 --> 01:13:42.399
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, I do.

01:13:42.459 --> 01:13:43.319
[SPEAKER_25]: That still sucks, though.

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:49.944
[SPEAKER_22]: and F you to the stupid people on eBay who I'm buying the freaking Mystery Science Theater 3000 movies for.

01:13:50.004 --> 01:13:55.028
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, listen, I'm buying 46 movies for about, eh, it's going about $52 right now.

01:13:55.608 --> 01:13:58.670
[SPEAKER_22]: Stop emailing me, you people, that I'm not bidding on your auctions.

01:13:58.970 --> 01:14:00.732
[SPEAKER_22]: They're trying to sell me movies for $5 a piece.

01:14:00.832 --> 01:14:06.616
[SPEAKER_22]: Listen, I'm buying taped movies because I can't, I already own all the ones that are legit, okay?

01:14:06.756 --> 01:14:08.557
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't try to sell me legit shit.

01:14:08.697 --> 01:14:09.278
[SPEAKER_22]: I already own it.

01:14:10.358 --> 01:14:12.160
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck you to you, stupid ass.

01:14:13.366 --> 01:14:17.027
[SPEAKER_25]: AIDS-infected cocksucking motherfuckers who spam email people.

01:14:17.367 --> 01:14:26.810
[SPEAKER_25]: I get sick of going to my goddamn account and having to delete 135 messages because you guys can't stop telling me about ink cartridges and penis enlargement programs.

01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:29.311
[SPEAKER_25]: Look, if my dick was small, your wife wouldn't like it.

01:14:29.351 --> 01:14:30.451
[SPEAKER_25]: Quit fucking emailing me.

01:14:33.055 --> 01:14:42.444
[SPEAKER_27]: Just a side note on that one, does anybody ever notice that the females always get the ones for the dick enlargements, and the guys always get the ones for the boob enlargements?

01:14:42.825 --> 01:14:47.910
[SPEAKER_28]: Exactly, I think I just deleted something out of my box today, it's all Tealshark39, enhance your penis naturally.

01:14:47.930 --> 01:14:51.634
[SPEAKER_28]: I was like, wow, if I'm enhancing my penis, I've got a lot of issues right there.

01:14:52.754 --> 01:14:58.681
[SPEAKER_25]: I swear there was one guy who actually did an interview where he stated that he was happy spamming because he got paid.

01:14:58.941 --> 01:15:04.327
[SPEAKER_25]: If I see you on the street, I'm going to stomp your motherfucking nutsack and then I'm going to drop an elbow on your fucking nose and kill you.

01:15:04.588 --> 01:15:05.509
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura's in the bathroom.

01:15:05.529 --> 01:15:06.370
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm going to give it to Loki.

01:15:07.890 --> 01:15:10.652
[SPEAKER_22]: and just so you know, spammers, I am happy with my breast size.

01:15:11.133 --> 01:15:15.277
[SPEAKER_22]: So stop sending me emails.

01:15:15.777 --> 01:15:19.321
[SPEAKER_22]: And like all the weird ones, like they send you, you just won this, you just won that.

01:15:19.801 --> 01:15:30.172
[SPEAKER_22]: And what's funny is all the websites that I go on to, I use different names, so they'll send me like, hey Bob Bob, you just won da da da.

01:15:30.888 --> 01:15:32.249
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what you're going to win if I find you?

01:15:32.269 --> 01:15:33.610
[SPEAKER_25]: A fucking hatchet to the head.

01:15:33.971 --> 01:15:34.511
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sick of this.

01:15:34.611 --> 01:15:40.736
[SPEAKER_25]: Every five seconds, live nude girls getting fucked by horses in the ass while they're being, you know, blown by a fucking seal.

01:15:41.056 --> 01:15:42.097
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't want to see this shit.

01:15:42.437 --> 01:15:45.540
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm into some kinky shit, but I'm not into live nude girls being fucked by horses.

01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:47.481
[SPEAKER_25]: Quit mailing me this shit in my email.

01:15:47.501 --> 01:15:48.122
[SPEAKER_25]: I get sick of it.

01:15:48.142 --> 01:15:49.563
[SPEAKER_25]: I got to delete like 50 messages.

01:15:49.603 --> 01:15:50.524
[SPEAKER_25]: Want to see live nude girls?

01:15:50.684 --> 01:15:52.025
[SPEAKER_25]: No, you want to see live nude girls.

01:15:52.265 --> 01:15:56.889
[SPEAKER_25]: You're a 400-pound man sitting off in a goddamn room who hasn't seen a fucking pussy ever since you were born.

01:15:57.189 --> 01:15:58.170
[SPEAKER_25]: Leave me the fuck alone.

01:15:59.591 --> 01:16:02.233
[SPEAKER_27]: I've got another FU, and I think this is one that Rob would be proud of.

01:16:02.673 --> 01:16:13.261
[SPEAKER_27]: I'd like to say a massive FU for whoever the associates were at Fox that decided to freaking get rid of Frenchie, the only goddamn talent that they've ever had.

01:16:14.582 --> 01:16:20.327
[SPEAKER_26]: We can't have her on the show because American Idol has so much dignity, and she worked on a porn site.

01:16:20.367 --> 01:16:22.468
[SPEAKER_26]: Half of you are looking at it right now.

01:16:23.649 --> 01:16:25.791
[SPEAKER_28]: Back to the spam thing.

01:16:26.011 --> 01:16:28.713
[SPEAKER_28]: The best spam I have ever received, I actually kept.

01:16:29.326 --> 01:16:29.826
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello.

01:16:30.386 --> 01:16:32.967
[SPEAKER_28]: If you are a time traveler, I'm going to need the following.

01:16:33.567 --> 01:16:40.128
[SPEAKER_28]: One, a modified mind-warping dimensional warp generator number 524350A series wristwatch with memory adapter.

01:16:40.448 --> 01:16:45.289
[SPEAKER_28]: Two, reliable carbon-based or silicon-based time-transducing capacitor.

01:16:45.649 --> 01:16:46.770
[SPEAKER_28]: I need a reliable source.

01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:48.490
[SPEAKER_28]: Please only reply if you're reliable.

01:16:48.710 --> 01:16:50.911
[SPEAKER_28]: Send a separate email to me at and give an address.

01:16:51.391 --> 01:16:52.771
[SPEAKER_28]: What the hell?

01:16:53.621 --> 01:16:54.722
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki,

01:17:13.775 --> 01:17:17.116
[SPEAKER_22]: I check my email about eight times a day because of so much spam and it's in there.

01:17:17.136 --> 01:17:21.478
[SPEAKER_22]: I have to go and clean it out because I have a limited mailbox that I can have mail in.

01:17:22.438 --> 01:17:31.221
[SPEAKER_22]: But I have to say, I think I mentioned this a couple weeks back, the most creative email I've ever gotten trying to get my personal information was they sent this email from an actual legit...

01:17:32.521 --> 01:17:33.842
[SPEAKER_22]: Yahoo Service in India.

01:17:52.867 --> 01:17:54.247
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, there's something I'm comfortable with.

01:17:54.267 --> 01:17:57.288
[SPEAKER_25]: Sending out my personal information over the internet to somebody that I don't know.

01:17:57.648 --> 01:18:02.389
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh yeah, fuck you to Japanese pornographers who put those fucking little mosaics over all the good stuff.

01:18:02.449 --> 01:18:03.369
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sick of that shit.

01:18:04.109 --> 01:18:04.929
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually a law.

01:18:05.889 --> 01:18:08.510
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still a law, so they have to do it to sell their porn.

01:18:09.170 --> 01:18:10.770
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to see Anna O'Hearn naked.

01:18:11.690 --> 01:18:13.671
[SPEAKER_03]: I can show you Final Fuck X later.

01:18:13.691 --> 01:18:16.931
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, my turn.

01:18:22.398 --> 01:18:25.920
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you to alcohol for making me have to pee all the time.

01:18:27.981 --> 01:18:29.502
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you again to the spammers.

01:18:29.822 --> 01:18:33.024
[SPEAKER_03]: But see, I only have two active emails that I use.

01:18:33.064 --> 01:18:36.605
[SPEAKER_03]: All the rest of my AOL names are blocked from the internet, but DarkSakura.com was left open.

01:18:36.625 --> 01:18:40.167
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually do have the site, but anyway.

01:18:40.487 --> 01:18:44.970
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura at AOL.com is now blocked from everybody, except for the chosen few.

01:18:45.410 --> 01:18:46.610
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the chosen few.

01:18:47.071 --> 01:18:47.751
[SPEAKER_03]: Delete few.

01:18:47.831 --> 01:18:50.392
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to be among them, you can ask me, and I might say no.

01:18:51.133 --> 01:18:51.193
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

01:18:52.709 --> 01:18:54.410
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not telling you my other one, hell no.

01:18:56.512 --> 01:19:01.575
[SPEAKER_03]: But my other one has to do with this stupid dumbass who walked out behind my car today.

01:19:01.635 --> 01:19:02.455
[SPEAKER_03]: I nearly ran him over.

01:19:02.896 --> 01:19:03.276
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?

01:19:03.336 --> 01:19:04.176
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I had.

01:19:04.697 --> 01:19:07.278
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the world would have been better without him in the gene pool.

01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:17.585
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck you goes to... He's like the little kid's pee or log floating in the gene pool.

01:19:18.826 --> 01:19:20.827
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, he is the feces of the gene pool.

01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:27.636
[SPEAKER_03]: My other fuck you of the week goes to my Beatmania 2DX controller.

01:19:28.457 --> 01:19:33.944
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, normally when you have sticky keys on your 2DX controller, it's either going to be your first or your 7 key, am I right?

01:19:35.165 --> 01:19:35.566
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically.

01:19:36.427 --> 01:19:37.769
[SPEAKER_03]: My sticky key is my 4 key!

01:19:38.684 --> 01:19:41.948
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the top middle purple key, or blue, or whatever color it is.

01:19:42.448 --> 01:19:43.009
[SPEAKER_03]: It sticks.

01:19:43.770 --> 01:19:49.176
[SPEAKER_03]: It really makes it hard to try to pass R5, because you have that one key that's like the center key.

01:19:49.777 --> 01:19:54.082
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I come really close to passing a 7.

01:19:54.903 --> 01:19:55.203
[SPEAKER_03]: And then...

01:19:56.644 --> 01:19:57.265
[SPEAKER_03]: That sticky key.

01:19:57.545 --> 01:19:57.905
[SPEAKER_03]: Ruined it.

01:19:58.326 --> 01:20:04.710
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, by the way, also, fuck you goes toward, um, not Don't Look Back, because that's not in 8th style.

01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:05.471
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that song?

01:20:06.751 --> 01:20:07.812
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't go.

01:20:09.453 --> 01:20:11.475
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a 78% on that first time.

01:20:14.757 --> 01:20:16.958
[SPEAKER_03]: So, fuck you to the chat room.

01:20:16.978 --> 01:20:17.519
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm kidding.

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:25.405
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Jahi is going to read the fuck you's from the chatroom, but I'm just saying fuck you to please don't go because I had a 78% on that.

01:20:25.465 --> 01:20:26.746
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, I was not playing it easy.

01:20:27.987 --> 01:20:29.488
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um... Why are you looking at me?

01:20:29.808 --> 01:20:30.288
[SPEAKER_03]: Because!

01:20:31.129 --> 01:20:34.171
[SPEAKER_03]: I want you... You think I'm going to deny you the 7?

01:20:34.211 --> 01:20:34.611
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not.

01:20:35.712 --> 01:20:35.912
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

01:20:36.493 --> 01:20:36.753
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:20:37.113 --> 01:20:37.393
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

01:20:37.413 --> 01:20:38.414

[SPEAKER_25]: Oh.

01:22:04.287 --> 01:22:06.648
[SPEAKER_25]: I say not quite retail because it's not like Walmart or Target.

01:22:06.668 --> 01:22:10.050
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a little bit smaller so you can get away with a little bit more, but I'll give him an exception.

[SPEAKER_03]: Any suggestions?

01:23:04.565 --> 01:23:06.385
[SPEAKER_21]: Damn, we have like an hour left.

01:23:06.965 --> 01:23:08.045
[SPEAKER_21]: Or an hour and a half left.

01:23:08.985 --> 01:23:12.246
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, uh, the words aren't on the screen!

01:23:12.406 --> 01:23:13.306
[SPEAKER_22]: People, come back!

01:23:16.527 --> 01:23:17.607
[SPEAKER_03]: You're being awfully quiet.

01:23:17.747 --> 01:23:18.267
[SPEAKER_03]: You're tired.

01:23:22.353 --> 01:23:24.214
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you like to say something enlightening to the chatroom?

01:23:25.955 --> 01:23:28.497
[SPEAKER_27]: I really, really, really, really hate Sherry's Berries.

01:23:30.498 --> 01:23:32.439
[SPEAKER_03]: You heard it here on Orange Child Radio.

01:23:32.819 --> 01:23:33.740
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll alert the media.

01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:35.021
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait, we are the media.

01:23:36.181 --> 01:23:36.601
[SPEAKER_22]: Me too.

01:23:36.702 --> 01:23:39.143
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't like chocolate-covered anything except ice cream.

01:23:41.704 --> 01:23:46.347
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you still want your bowl of ice cream and wetty rip and your two women...

01:23:48.413 --> 01:23:50.455
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, that's like ice cream.

01:23:51.215 --> 01:23:52.457
[SPEAKER_22]: It's Asian ice cream.

01:23:53.477 --> 01:23:53.938
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh yeah.

01:23:55.379 --> 01:23:56.600
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should go to a break.

01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:57.801
[SPEAKER_03]: Who agrees with me?

01:23:59.062 --> 01:24:02.725
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, half of our people have already gone downstairs to watch the Ron Jeremy movie.

01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:07.670
[SPEAKER_03]: There goes one of our hosts!

01:24:08.467 --> 01:24:33.420
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to an extended break, um, yeah, an extended break, some of us have to pee too, um, except I already went, you didn't need to know that, god, now I'm in here by myself, jeez, okay, yeah, well, fuck you, okay, um, I'm gonna go ahead and play some, um, you know, for Screw This Bit Money Stuff, I'm gonna play some, uh,

[SPEAKER_03]: ORIGINALS!

[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm gonna play some original versions of some songs.

01:24:42.199 --> 01:24:46.440
[SPEAKER_03]: And on top of that, I'm gonna play, like, Japanese versions of these original stuff.

01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:49.061
[SPEAKER_03]: Although you've probably already heard these.

01:24:49.341 --> 01:24:51.641
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait, do we have another Fuck You?

01:24:51.881 --> 01:24:56.402
[SPEAKER_03]: We might do Match Game later, but for right now, I'm not playing Jack Off Jill!

01:24:56.803 --> 01:24:58.043
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thank you.

01:24:59.384 --> 01:24:59.965

[SPEAKER_14]: I'm far away from anyone Don't wake me up if it's a dream To the other side of the sky Hold me tight

01:36:48.507 --> 01:36:50.031

01:37:30.948 --> 01:37:31.709
[SPEAKER_03]: We're back live!

01:37:31.989 --> 01:37:34.710
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a series of long versions.

01:37:35.110 --> 01:37:40.473
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one that we had was Enflo with Flojack, Mr. Drunk Remix.

01:37:42.150 --> 01:37:45.573
[SPEAKER_03]: Judy and Mary with Silbacassu, which, yeah, the English version was in DDR.

01:37:46.134 --> 01:37:50.298
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Gacked with Another World, a song that made it into Guitar Freak's seventh fix.

01:37:51.639 --> 01:37:52.860
[SPEAKER_03]: God, he's hot, isn't he?

01:37:54.121 --> 01:37:56.323
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, you want to tell us about the movie that everyone downstairs is watching?

01:37:57.784 --> 01:38:00.967
[SPEAKER_22]: They're watching Pornstar, The Legend of Ron Jeremy.

01:38:01.307 --> 01:38:06.552
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a documentary about Ron Jeremy, the most famous male porn star in the industry.

01:38:07.722 --> 01:38:12.723
[SPEAKER_25]: See, here's what's scary about the porn industry, and I read this from an article, actually, about another famous porn star.

01:38:12.763 --> 01:38:15.124
[SPEAKER_25]: His name slips my mind.

01:38:15.564 --> 01:38:16.164
[SPEAKER_25]: He's done a lot.

01:38:16.304 --> 01:38:16.744
[SPEAKER_25]: Rocco.

01:38:16.905 --> 01:38:18.585
[SPEAKER_25]: Rocco Cifredi, I think his name is.

01:38:19.065 --> 01:38:33.329
[SPEAKER_25]: The guy stated the fact that everybody in the porn industry has a case of herpes, and, you know, you may be looking at Jenna Jameson or Asia Carrera at home, but you have to consider the fact that they might have, like, more diseases than Nicole Smith has lawsuits over that old guy, so it's kind of scary.

01:38:34.821 --> 01:38:42.147
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, Ron Jeremy said that he's only come down with, what was it, The Crabs and something else one time, but that was before he got in the industry.

01:38:42.167 --> 01:38:44.769
[SPEAKER_22]: He's been 21 years in the industry, and he's been clean the whole time.

01:38:46.010 --> 01:38:47.831
[SPEAKER_22]: Wow, he must have been getting some decent chicks in.

01:38:47.891 --> 01:38:48.652
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, I'd be scared.

01:38:48.992 --> 01:38:51.854
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, you know, you think about it, like, you hear about, like, gangbangs and stuff.

01:38:52.154 --> 01:38:52.815
[SPEAKER_25]: Who was the last?

01:38:52.975 --> 01:38:53.495
[SPEAKER_25]: Jasmine St.

01:38:53.555 --> 01:38:56.498
[SPEAKER_25]: Clair, and there was some other chick, Houston, I think her name was.

01:38:57.198 --> 01:38:59.200
[SPEAKER_25]: They go through, like, 500 guys.

01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:00.681
[SPEAKER_25]: That's scary.

01:39:00.701 --> 01:39:03.383
[SPEAKER_25]: You'd have to back a Ryder truck into that to catch a feeling.

01:39:03.403 --> 01:39:04.444
[SPEAKER_25]: That's, like, ugh.

01:39:06.462 --> 01:39:07.503
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:39:29.656 --> 01:39:29.956
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura.com

01:39:51.874 --> 01:39:52.575
[SPEAKER_25]: We need more of that.

01:39:52.595 --> 01:39:59.884
[SPEAKER_25]: We need more women who are open about that sort of thing to actually get out there and talk to guys and completely shatter that whole stereotype.

01:40:00.405 --> 01:40:02.448
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I think it would make things a lot easier on guys.

01:40:02.488 --> 01:40:05.312
[SPEAKER_25]: Plus you'd let them know if they were in the friend zone a lot easier and that would help.

01:40:06.974 --> 01:40:09.076
[SPEAKER_22]: Nothing's hotter than a woman coming on to you.

01:40:12.188 --> 01:40:13.129
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:40:25.856 --> 01:40:26.376
[SPEAKER_22]: Not really.

01:40:26.617 --> 01:40:28.438
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's see, more stuff about Ron Jeremy.

01:40:28.918 --> 01:40:31.540
[SPEAKER_22]: His penis is 9 inches 3 quarters.

01:40:32.420 --> 01:40:33.721
[SPEAKER_22]: He can give himself head.

01:40:34.822 --> 01:40:38.184
[SPEAKER_22]: He's been in the industry 21 years, been clean ever since.

01:40:40.045 --> 01:40:43.888
[SPEAKER_22]: He's... I don't know, let me think here.

01:40:43.908 --> 01:40:45.369
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

01:40:46.770 --> 01:40:47.630
[SPEAKER_25]: He's cool in orgasmo.

01:40:49.091 --> 01:40:51.353
[SPEAKER_25]: Orgasmo is a pimp-ass movie if you haven't seen it.

01:40:53.155 --> 01:40:56.458
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know, maybe some of the women can respond to this in the chatroom too if there are any in there.

01:40:56.938 --> 01:41:02.703
[SPEAKER_25]: I've heard that women only like between 5 to 7 inches because 9 is painful or something.

01:41:03.184 --> 01:41:06.186
[SPEAKER_25]: I guess I'll make that little survey after DarkSakura gets back.

01:41:06.206 --> 01:41:07.107
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's know about that one.

01:41:07.628 --> 01:41:08.508
[SPEAKER_25]: Wait, she has something to say.

01:41:09.449 --> 01:41:11.211
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's time to play Match Game!

01:41:11.771 --> 01:41:13.192
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

01:41:13.453 --> 01:41:15.855
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I won't play Match Game.

01:41:20.221 --> 01:41:30.972
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we don't have our nice porn music playing in the background, so... Yeah, they're all downstairs listening to the... It's the porn groove.

01:41:35.177 --> 01:41:35.477
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

01:41:35.917 --> 01:41:36.618
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that like?

01:41:38.180 --> 01:41:39.021
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, tell everyone about it.

01:41:40.521 --> 01:41:45.626
[SPEAKER_28]: Apparently he told some director that he could do that, and they're like, you have to do this on film!

01:41:45.666 --> 01:41:50.810
[SPEAKER_28]: And so the next thing they show is him kind of looking around in some really cheesy-ass film.

01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:53.813
[SPEAKER_28]: Next thing you know, he is kissing the tip of his own dick.

01:41:54.373 --> 01:41:58.156
[SPEAKER_28]: It's just like, that's really freaking impressive.

01:41:58.317 --> 01:42:04.182
[SPEAKER_28]: I did not see him giving himself head, I'm sure he could do it, but yeah, they actually showed him kissing himself.

01:42:05.922 --> 01:42:07.563
[SPEAKER_22]: He says he can't really give himself head.

01:42:07.603 --> 01:42:10.465
[SPEAKER_22]: He can just, you know, kind of get... Not anymore?

01:42:11.785 --> 01:42:13.426
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, well, I don't know.

01:42:13.446 --> 01:42:14.607
[SPEAKER_22]: He said he could only get the tip in.

01:42:18.129 --> 01:42:18.950

[SPEAKER_03]: EvilNauki2DX has left our chatroom.

01:52:21.978 --> 01:52:24.059
[SPEAKER_03]: I just noticed.

01:52:25.559 --> 01:52:27.800
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we going to be able to find another contestant in the interim?

01:52:28.260 --> 01:52:30.121
[SPEAKER_03]: Who wants to take Naoki's place?

01:52:30.441 --> 01:52:31.041
[SPEAKER_03]: Or should we wait?

01:52:31.421 --> 01:52:32.161
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, chatroom.

01:52:32.842 --> 01:52:33.962
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, should we wait for Naoki?

01:52:35.362 --> 01:52:36.323
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we give him a few minutes?

01:52:36.343 --> 01:52:40.644
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go ahead and take another break.

01:52:40.664 --> 01:52:43.085
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll give him a few minutes to show up.

01:52:44.930 --> 01:52:49.114
[SPEAKER_03]: And if he doesn't show up, then we'll have to find a replacement.

01:52:51.115 --> 01:52:54.298
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably in the interest of fairness, we'll have to go ahead and set his point aside.

01:52:54.378 --> 01:52:59.842
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll go ahead and play a song or two just to give him some time.

01:52:59.862 --> 01:53:00.483
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fair, right?

01:53:01.704 --> 01:53:02.024
[SPEAKER_03]: One song.

01:53:02.605 --> 01:53:04.226
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go ahead and pick a song.

01:53:04.326 --> 01:53:04.927
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll play...

[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

01:53:08.083 --> 01:53:15.367
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to put this in the interest of nice, pornerific music, let me go into my DDR directory here.

01:53:17.428 --> 01:53:27.855
[SPEAKER_03]: And we will play... God, as soon as I can find it... I can't find my song, dammit.

01:53:28.855 --> 01:53:29.636
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll play Doomie!

01:53:30.817 --> 01:53:34.379
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a minute and 21 seconds to get your butt back online.

01:54:58.783 --> 01:55:00.044
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Nelke's not back.

01:55:00.284 --> 01:55:05.347
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we're going to go ahead and pick the next person in the chat room.

01:55:05.407 --> 01:55:06.988
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll put it to a vote, okay?

01:55:08.749 --> 01:55:11.070

[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTesia, you've been voted in the Deathmatch Arena.

01:55:31.699 --> 01:55:33.640
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been voted onto the island, yes.

01:55:34.341 --> 01:55:42.565

[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead and play more match game music.

01:56:05.143 --> 01:56:07.745
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't make us play more match game music.

01:56:07.865 --> 01:56:08.666

[SPEAKER_03]: His penis wasn't as big as Ron Jeremy's.

01:59:17.834 --> 01:59:19.075
[SPEAKER_03]: What does that have to do with PA?

01:59:19.095 --> 01:59:19.736
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll never know.

01:59:19.756 --> 01:59:22.617
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop talking about Ron Jeremy, Perry!

01:59:22.657 --> 01:59:25.079
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTestia says, because he was watching porn.

01:59:27.159 --> 01:59:34.346
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, my answer, my answer, because Tigger already entered it and he would have won anyway.

01:59:37.408 --> 01:59:41.772
[SPEAKER_22]: Because it doesn't matter, because if Tigger enters, you're going to lose, so go home and sleep.

01:59:43.053 --> 01:59:43.253
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

01:59:45.195 --> 01:59:48.478
[SPEAKER_25]: I said because he was too busy fapping to Anohor Prawn.

01:59:49.399 --> 01:59:50.480
[SPEAKER_25]: She has a really nice ass.

01:59:53.033 --> 01:59:55.134
[SPEAKER_28]: I said because, what did I say?

01:59:55.194 --> 01:59:57.115
[SPEAKER_28]: Because he was watching Ron Jeremy give himself head.

02:00:00.297 --> 02:00:02.458
[SPEAKER_03]: Both of those involve watching porn, right?

02:00:04.459 --> 02:00:06.220
[SPEAKER_03]: He gets a half point for each of those.

02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:09.842
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, DarkSakura is ahead by one point.

02:00:14.925 --> 02:00:17.066
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, next question.

02:00:19.065 --> 02:00:28.793
[SPEAKER_03]: For his birthday, Loki asked for a bowl of ice cream and blank For his birthday, Loki asked for a bowl of ice cream and blank

02:00:45.752 --> 02:00:46.672
Thank you for watching!

02:01:24.588 --> 02:01:26.110
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we have answers.

02:01:26.670 --> 02:01:30.273
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's go ahead and go to our contestants.

02:01:30.673 --> 02:01:32.335
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, back to the question.

02:01:32.875 --> 02:01:34.317
[SPEAKER_03]: Perry the Perfect Attacker, when does it end?

02:01:34.537 --> 02:01:35.237
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's the wrong one.

02:01:35.377 --> 02:01:35.718
[SPEAKER_03]: My bad.

02:01:36.531 --> 02:01:39.173
[SPEAKER_03]: For his birthday, Loki asked for a bowl of ice cream and blank.

02:01:40.294 --> 02:01:42.516
[SPEAKER_03]: EOSFB said, Ron Jeremy porn.

02:01:43.977 --> 02:01:45.298
Stop saying that!

02:01:46.338 --> 02:01:47.179
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuckin' A!

02:01:47.559 --> 02:01:48.860
[SPEAKER_22]: Stop talking about Ron Jeremy!

02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:50.281
[SPEAKER_22]: The show isn't about him!

02:01:52.063 --> 02:01:54.985
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, DarkTessia says, Asian midget porn.

02:01:57.130 --> 02:01:59.251
[SPEAKER_22]: The fuck would I want Asian midget porn?

02:01:59.631 --> 02:02:00.992
[SPEAKER_22]: They actually have Asian midgets?

02:02:01.012 --> 02:02:02.133
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what I want to know, man.

02:02:03.273 --> 02:02:04.474
[SPEAKER_22]: How tall do they stand?

02:02:05.775 --> 02:02:06.635
[SPEAKER_03]: Two feet three.

02:02:07.596 --> 02:02:07.916
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

02:02:10.637 --> 02:02:14.259
[SPEAKER_03]: For his birthday, Loki asked for a bowl of ice cream and a license to kill idiots.

02:02:16.100 --> 02:02:17.001
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a close second.

02:02:18.381 --> 02:02:18.722
Mine was...

02:02:23.570 --> 02:02:29.316
[SPEAKER_22]: A giant harem full of young Asian schoolgirls, naked and horny, with whipped cream.

02:02:29.616 --> 02:02:30.577
[SPEAKER_22]: Lots of whipped cream.

02:02:31.318 --> 02:02:34.641
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, you know, now that I mention it, yeah, Asian schoolgirls naked.

02:02:35.201 --> 02:02:40.787
[SPEAKER_22]: And because I can't, you know, obviously I'm seeing someone, but you know, it's a gift, and it'd be wrong for me to refuse a gift.

02:02:43.810 --> 02:02:48.034
[SPEAKER_25]: Man, if you don't need all those schoolgirls, donate to the fucking Chinese schoolgirls fund for real.

02:02:48.815 --> 02:02:51.657
[SPEAKER_25]: But I was going to say a sweet transvestite from Transylvania.

02:02:55.980 --> 02:02:56.981
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not Rob.

02:02:58.602 --> 02:02:59.363
[SPEAKER_25]: We never know.

02:03:01.084 --> 02:03:04.086
[SPEAKER_28]: My answer was increased breast size from those spammers.

02:03:05.007 --> 02:03:06.147
[SPEAKER_25]: And increased penis size!

02:03:08.469 --> 02:03:10.531
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, we don't have a match.

02:03:12.932 --> 02:03:13.633
[SPEAKER_03]: No match for you!

02:03:15.253 --> 02:03:17.174
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you are loser.

02:03:17.894 --> 02:03:19.495
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, last question.

02:03:20.836 --> 02:03:25.979
[SPEAKER_03]: After playing seven games of DDR, Darla the Dancer decided to go rest by blank.

02:03:27.540 --> 02:03:28.160
[SPEAKER_03]: Send in your answer.

02:03:31.042 --> 02:03:33.163
[SPEAKER_03]: Darla the Dancer decided to rest by blank.

02:03:50.370 --> 02:03:51.070
Thank you for watching!

02:04:29.717 --> 02:04:30.498
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're back.

02:04:31.578 --> 02:04:37.381
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, after seven games of DDR, Darla the Dancer decided to go rest by blank.

02:04:37.841 --> 02:04:42.744
[SPEAKER_03]: EOSFB said, rest by cherry tree, er, I mean, Ron Jeremy's penis.

02:04:45.425 --> 02:04:47.806
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya said, masturbating with a bottle of Propel.

02:04:57.172 --> 02:05:03.976
[SPEAKER_25]: How the hell do you masturbate with a bottle of Propel?

02:05:04.016 --> 02:05:11.441
[SPEAKER_22]: Now a bottle of balls, that's different because it's kind of, you know, ribbed on the outside, so I assume that women might like that, you know.

02:05:13.464 --> 02:05:20.869
[SPEAKER_25]: That's a little bit disturbing, but you could probably fit it inside, like, you know, like, Anna Nicole Smith's vagina, I guess, maybe.

02:05:21.689 --> 02:05:23.831
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't get me started on the stories I've heard before.

02:05:24.511 --> 02:05:25.031
[SPEAKER_25]: Such as?

02:05:25.872 --> 02:05:26.733
[SPEAKER_25]: My mom's a nurse.

02:05:26.773 --> 02:05:27.633
[SPEAKER_25]: I've heard stories.

02:05:28.033 --> 02:05:28.914
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, where's story?

02:05:31.255 --> 02:05:31.976
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I'll save it.

02:05:32.436 --> 02:05:34.097
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, she's gonna save it, but I wanna hear this.

02:05:34.678 --> 02:05:35.738
[SPEAKER_22]: What's in their vagina?

02:05:37.740 --> 02:05:39.641
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we'll save that for right after the match game.

02:05:39.721 --> 02:05:40.741
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that fair?

02:05:42.042 --> 02:05:43.023
[SPEAKER_03]: My answer was

02:05:45.251 --> 02:05:49.292
[SPEAKER_03]: After playing seven games of DDR, Darla the Dancer decided to go rest by... Propel.

02:05:51.453 --> 02:05:51.953
[SPEAKER_03]: Just propel.

02:05:53.273 --> 02:05:53.733
[SPEAKER_22]: Your answer.

02:05:54.934 --> 02:05:59.395
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, rest by, are you talking about like an actual physical object that she's resting by?

02:06:00.355 --> 02:06:01.156
[SPEAKER_03]: Just propel.

02:06:02.096 --> 02:06:08.598
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, well anyways, I was gonna say, uh, Darla the Dancer decided to go rest by watching Ron Jeremy suck his own penis.

02:06:09.338 --> 02:06:13.139
[SPEAKER_22]: Since obviously that was every fucking other answer, ugh.

02:06:17.154 --> 02:06:24.660
[SPEAKER_25]: Darla went to go rest by watching one of my ninja schoolgirls practice because I have ninja schoolgirls and they are kickass.

02:06:27.703 --> 02:06:31.666
[SPEAKER_28]: I decided she was going to rest by blowing up Roseville Golf Land.

02:06:34.148 --> 02:06:35.810
[SPEAKER_25]: I want this movie that has ninja schoolgirls.

02:06:35.890 --> 02:06:36.950
[SPEAKER_25]: Ninja schoolgirls are cool.

02:06:38.272 --> 02:06:40.994
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, blowing up Roseville Golf Land sounds like my idea of restful.

02:06:41.614 --> 02:06:42.515
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it sounds exciting.

02:06:42.935 --> 02:06:44.697
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so DarkSakura gets half a point.

02:06:44.777 --> 02:06:45.918
[SPEAKER_03]: EOSFP gets half a point.

02:06:46.693 --> 02:06:48.655
[SPEAKER_03]: Which means that DarkSakura is our winner!

02:06:48.875 --> 02:06:52.840
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

02:06:55.402 --> 02:06:57.004
[SPEAKER_03]: You win a bloody anus!

02:06:57.845 --> 02:06:59.066
[SPEAKER_03]: Here on Originals Radio!

02:07:02.049 --> 02:07:06.214
[SPEAKER_03]: So Melody, you want to tell us about the segment, What Stuck Up the Vagina?

02:07:09.244 --> 02:07:16.308
[SPEAKER_28]: It actually wouldn't be a vagina unless spammers have actually come up with how to grow a new vagina instead of, like, increased breast size.

02:07:16.829 --> 02:07:25.934
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, my mom told me once she heard a story from an x-ray tech where this guy was complaining that, um, I don't remember what his complaint was, but they needed to do x-rays.

02:07:26.415 --> 02:07:34.360
[SPEAKER_28]: So, um, x-ray tech took him into the x-ray room and positioned him and everything, and she turns out the light, because you have to turn out the light to take an x-ray.

02:07:34.420 --> 02:07:36.401
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, there was still light in the room.

02:07:37.885 --> 02:07:41.654
[SPEAKER_28]: She can't figure it out until she realized the light was coming from the guy's ass.

02:07:43.137 --> 02:07:46.605
[SPEAKER_28]: Because he had inserted a flashlight and it had turned itself on.

02:07:49.542 --> 02:07:59.971
[SPEAKER_25]: Now, I can understand if, you know, you're a little bit kinky and, you know, there's nothing wrong with anal sex, that's your thing, you know, go ahead and do it, you know, as long as you're careful.

02:08:00.792 --> 02:08:08.619
[SPEAKER_25]: But there are just some things that shouldn't go in your ass, and I'm pretty sure flashlights, cell phones are one, but I'm pretty sure flashlights are up there in the top five.

02:08:08.879 --> 02:08:10.941
[SPEAKER_25]: Barbie dolls or others, hamsters, no.

02:08:11.762 --> 02:08:14.384
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, but, no, okay?

02:08:14.904 --> 02:08:16.586
[SPEAKER_25]: Just flashlights, don't play that game.

02:08:18.542 --> 02:08:21.545
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm no rocket scientist or anything, but you don't just fall on a cucumber, you know?

02:08:21.565 --> 02:08:22.025
[SPEAKER_25]: Wait, hang on, Melody.

02:08:47.080 --> 02:08:50.421
[SPEAKER_28]: My question is, why are you naked and falling on a cucumber in the first place?

02:08:51.181 --> 02:08:59.824
[SPEAKER_25]: I do that every day, you know, I go home at random and, um, I just grease up a Crisco, a cucumber with Crisco, I just fall on that motherfucker because I feel like it.

02:09:00.044 --> 02:09:01.965
[SPEAKER_25]: Fucking Johnny Knoxville wannabe motherfucker.

02:09:04.666 --> 02:09:06.966
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should introduce a new segment on the show, by the way.

02:09:08.187 --> 02:09:09.367
[SPEAKER_03]: The Darwin Awards segment.

02:09:11.428 --> 02:09:14.029
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to read some information off of the Darwin Awards.

02:09:14.509 --> 02:09:15.229
[SPEAKER_03]: News stories.

02:09:17.634 --> 02:09:20.577
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to read one called Midnight Snack.

02:09:21.217 --> 02:09:23.399
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

02:09:23.499 --> 02:09:24.980
[SPEAKER_03]: 23rd October 2002, Australia.

02:09:25.561 --> 02:09:28.183
[SPEAKER_03]: What, besides beer, is Australia's most recognizable symbol?

02:09:28.643 --> 02:09:32.567
[SPEAKER_03]: Saltwater crocodiles, of course, as popularized by crocodile hunter Steve Irwin.

02:09:33.766 --> 02:09:35.167
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the most natural tourist activity?

02:09:35.447 --> 02:09:37.787
[SPEAKER_03]: Why viewing these amazing beauties in our natural habitat?

02:09:38.328 --> 02:09:49.371
[SPEAKER_03]: Tourists from around the world visit the wild places of Australia, so open water is routinely posted with a graphic warning sign to let people know that swimming with these dinosaur-like carnivores is not a good idea.

02:09:49.791 --> 02:09:52.392
[SPEAKER_03]: The sign typically shows a human figure between the jaws of a salty.

02:09:53.272 --> 02:09:58.794
[SPEAKER_03]: The blunt graphic has proven so effective enough that there have been no crocodile-related deaths in the Northern Territory since 1998.

02:09:58.834 --> 02:09:59.334
[SPEAKER_03]: At least, not until now.

02:10:01.849 --> 02:10:02.430
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

02:10:11.786 --> 02:10:16.530
[SPEAKER_03]: The woman, a short-lived member of an adventure tour group, was about to get more adventure than is generally advertised.

02:10:16.991 --> 02:10:19.493
[SPEAKER_03]: Police Commander Max Pope stated, How's that for stupid?! !

02:10:38.964 --> 02:10:40.205
[SPEAKER_22]: That's not that bad.

02:10:40.285 --> 02:10:43.047
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I've seen, I've heard worse.

02:10:43.868 --> 02:10:57.497
[SPEAKER_22]: There was a funny one about some guy that like fell over a cliff or the, something about like, I don't know, it had to do with some guy in a tree or something and then there was a truck on a cliff or something and they backed it up and ran over the guy in the tree.

02:10:57.537 --> 02:10:59.819
[SPEAKER_25]: I got a Darwin Award.

02:10:59.839 --> 02:11:02.120
[SPEAKER_25]: Pump Daddy thought he could come up with something fucking original.

02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:02.861
[SPEAKER_25]: There's your Darwin.

02:11:03.902 --> 02:11:04.562
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's another one.

02:11:05.403 --> 02:11:06.223
[SPEAKER_03]: November 2002, The Netherlands.

02:11:07.694 --> 02:11:08.556
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:11:21.264 --> 02:11:24.847
[SPEAKER_03]: Then a detective missed a bullet by inches when he opened a booby-trapped wooden chest.

02:11:25.307 --> 02:11:28.409
[SPEAKER_03]: Police beat a hasty retreat from the property and called in military experts.

02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:34.374
[SPEAKER_03]: They deciphered an enigmatic series of scribbled clues to locate 19 death traps in walls, ceilings, and household objects.

02:11:35.074 --> 02:11:42.279
[SPEAKER_03]: A pile of booby-trapped dinner plates was revealed by the clue, Cheaper by the Dozen, a reference to a film in which a child throws a plate at someone's head.

02:11:42.900 --> 02:11:45.562
[SPEAKER_03]: Police speculate that the notes were intended to assist his failing memory.

02:11:46.747 --> 02:11:55.270
[SPEAKER_03]: Other traps included numerous concealed shotguns triggered by threads and an exploding crate of beer set to detonate once a certain number of bottles were removed.

02:11:56.170 --> 02:12:01.112
[SPEAKER_03]: It took three weeks to crack 19 of the 20 clues, and experts were forced to admit defeat on the final note.

02:12:01.512 --> 02:12:04.613
[SPEAKER_03]: The Twelve Apostles are ready to work on the pebbles, said one.

02:12:05.033 --> 02:12:06.734
[SPEAKER_03]: We have never come across anything like it before.

02:12:06.874 --> 02:12:07.954
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all fiendishly clever.

02:12:08.726 --> 02:12:15.947
[SPEAKER_03]: True to form, the fiendishly clever but careless Darwin Award winner was described by neighbors as a tactical but harmless man who employed puttering in his garage.

02:12:16.787 --> 02:12:20.068
[SPEAKER_03]: But relatives say he never forgave his wife for divorcing him 20 years before.

02:12:20.828 --> 02:12:24.889
[SPEAKER_03]: Police believe he began installing the traps for four years after losing a lengthy battle to keep his home.

02:12:25.789 --> 02:12:34.050
[SPEAKER_03]: Although some may argue that 14 children in his advanced age rule out a Darwin Award, the judges feel the magnitude of his actions overcome by these practical concerns.

02:12:35.731 --> 02:12:36.531
[SPEAKER_03]: That one was cool.

02:12:37.651 --> 02:12:41.314
[SPEAKER_03]: Booby-trapping your home with 20 traps intended to kill your family.

02:12:56.878 --> 02:13:13.227
[SPEAKER_28]: In World War I or II, I can't remember which, I don't think I ever really knew, and he lives in the Midwest in Missouri, and he passed away recently, and my aunt and uncle moved into his house, and they were going through some of his stuff in his basement and found a bunch of his World War I memorabilia, and they found a hand grenade.

02:13:14.622 --> 02:13:17.123
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, they're like, okay, this is interesting, so they call the St.

02:13:17.143 --> 02:13:23.004
[SPEAKER_28]: Joseph's Police, who have no bomb squad, because it's not a small town, but it's not exactly huge, so they have to call Kansas City.

02:13:23.365 --> 02:13:28.946
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, Kansas City, of course, has a bomb squad, but they can't really do anything about it, because it's a good hour's drive away.

02:13:30.067 --> 02:13:35.428
[SPEAKER_28]: So, Kansas City says, okay, call Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, for help.

02:13:36.768 --> 02:13:37.789
[SPEAKER_28]: They call Fort Leavenworth.

02:13:37.829 --> 02:13:41.870
[SPEAKER_28]: The first thing that Fort Leavenworth says is, okay, well, where is the hand grenade?

02:13:42.987 --> 02:13:44.908
[SPEAKER_28]: And they're like, it's right next to us.

02:13:45.829 --> 02:13:49.271
[SPEAKER_28]: The first thing they say is, get out of the house this instant.

02:13:50.172 --> 02:13:51.312
[SPEAKER_28]: Hang up the phone and leave.

02:13:51.653 --> 02:13:58.057
[SPEAKER_28]: Because apparently these grenades, when they're this old, have a tendency to go off on their own, just from being handled.

02:13:58.297 --> 02:14:00.839
[SPEAKER_28]: My uncle was tossing the damn thing in the air at the time.

02:14:00.859 --> 02:14:04.041
[SPEAKER_28]: He was like freaking juggling the hand grenade.

02:14:04.481 --> 02:14:10.625
[SPEAKER_28]: Fort Leavenworth drove out to my uncle's old house, got the grenade, put it in a brawn-proof box,

02:14:11.354 --> 02:14:16.496
[SPEAKER_28]: Duck tape the box to all freaking hell and had to take it back to the base to be exploded.

02:14:18.056 --> 02:14:21.518
[SPEAKER_25]: Because remember, folks, duct tape prevents explosions.

02:14:23.618 --> 02:14:25.739
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently it's good for acne or something.

02:14:25.759 --> 02:14:26.680
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

02:14:26.700 --> 02:14:27.840
[SPEAKER_28]: Stupid as all hell.

02:14:30.201 --> 02:14:33.942
[SPEAKER_28]: And my uncle is stupid as all hell because, yeah, he's just in here and he's do-do-do-do-do.

02:14:34.182 --> 02:14:34.943
[SPEAKER_28]: Here's the hand grenade.

02:14:34.963 --> 02:14:36.003
[SPEAKER_28]: I think I'll toss it in the air.

02:14:38.744 --> 02:14:39.004
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

02:14:39.614 --> 02:14:41.295
[SPEAKER_03]: I think on that note, we need to go to a break.

02:14:42.876 --> 02:14:53.301
[SPEAKER_03]: In this break, for the sake of Gumby, who is in our chat room, and hopefully listening to the show, we are going to play a song just for you.

02:14:55.122 --> 02:14:58.424
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to play Bumblebee, Sky's Voice Remix.

02:15:01.705 --> 02:15:04.747
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are going to play some random other stuff, maybe...

02:15:06.812 --> 02:15:10.253
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick Master from Poppin' Music, and some other random stuff.

02:15:11.233 --> 02:15:16.214
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from one of Rob's fuck-off shows, so here goes.

02:15:19.615 --> 02:15:27.576
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I guess we're going to do one more, because I got these much better parody lyrics for Bumblebee than that shit I did a little bit ago, so we're going to do this one instead.

02:15:27.616 --> 02:15:30.077
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes from DDR Angel and Stressa.

02:15:30.097 --> 02:15:31.537
[SPEAKER_00]: This is much better, so enjoy.

02:15:35.522 --> 02:15:37.844
[SPEAKER_13]: I know I'm gonna fuck this up, I apologize.

02:15:37.864 --> 02:15:38.245
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck you!

02:16:03.655 --> 02:16:27.603
[SPEAKER_16]: My foot kicks your ass when you walk in the room I go boom, boom, boom, you go zoom, zoom, zoom You're my format dance path, you're a real friend I wanna kick your ass until you're dead I'll shove my foot right up your ass To help you see it's true I don't like you, can't you see?

02:16:27.983 --> 02:16:29.564
[SPEAKER_16]: Now get the fuck away from me

02:16:31.656 --> 02:16:39.778
[SPEAKER_16]: Sweet little bumblebee, get the fuck away from me Sweet little bumblebee, just a bunch of fantasy Fuck you!

02:20:30.051 --> 02:20:30.715
Thanks for watching!

02:21:18.854 --> 02:21:20.025
Thank you for watching

02:23:34.167 --> 02:23:35.327
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, that was dead air.

02:23:35.387 --> 02:23:36.027
[SPEAKER_03]: My apologies.

02:23:36.427 --> 02:23:37.188
[SPEAKER_03]: We're live again.

02:23:37.868 --> 02:23:39.068
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, let's do a quick promo.

02:23:39.368 --> 02:23:40.328
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to our show's radio.

02:23:40.548 --> 02:23:41.869
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

02:23:44.255 --> 02:23:47.337
[SPEAKER_03]: Ask Orange Lounge

02:24:08.906 --> 02:24:10.527
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll send you answers!

02:24:12.208 --> 02:24:14.629
[SPEAKER_03]: In the interim, I'll go ahead... I just used a big word.

02:24:14.649 --> 02:24:15.830
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if they can understand that.

02:24:16.550 --> 02:24:16.730
[SPEAKER_03]: No?

02:24:18.391 --> 02:24:20.392
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have some, but not like I can play them on here.

02:24:21.713 --> 02:24:25.134
[SPEAKER_03]: Once we get about four questions up, then I'll go ahead and come back.

02:24:25.154 --> 02:24:31.117
[SPEAKER_03]: But right now... See, this is the song that I've been wanting us to play during our little questions.

02:24:31.177 --> 02:24:36.080
[SPEAKER_03]: And I dedicate this particular song to the dearly departed Oolong the Bunny.

02:24:37.421 --> 02:24:39.323
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to cosplay Oolong the Bunny, aren't we?

02:24:40.964 --> 02:24:41.965
[SPEAKER_22]: I guess that's the plan, yep.

02:24:42.846 --> 02:24:43.386
[SPEAKER_22]: That'd be fun.

02:24:44.407 --> 02:24:45.749
[SPEAKER_03]: I have costumes sort of designed.

02:24:45.789 --> 02:24:47.150
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to draw it out for you.

02:24:47.250 --> 02:24:47.910
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cool.

02:24:51.794 --> 02:24:55.437
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I have to make leg warmers, and I know how to do it.

02:24:55.898 --> 02:24:59.261
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to have the leg warmers and the bunny feet, but I know how to make bunny feet.

02:24:59.821 --> 02:25:01.523
[SPEAKER_03]: I know how to make bunny feet that fit over shoes.

02:25:03.491 --> 02:25:06.273
[SPEAKER_22]: All this bunny feet and leg warmer stuff's got me scared, okay?

02:25:06.313 --> 02:25:08.535
[SPEAKER_22]: I just, I wanted ears and a pancake.

02:25:08.795 --> 02:25:09.295
[SPEAKER_22]: That's it.

02:25:09.815 --> 02:25:11.537
[SPEAKER_22]: Ears, pancake, nothing else.

02:25:13.578 --> 02:25:14.559
[SPEAKER_28]: And this one's for Rob.

02:25:14.839 --> 02:25:15.499
[SPEAKER_28]: I want sleep.

02:25:15.879 --> 02:25:16.460
[SPEAKER_28]: Or pancake.

02:25:18.781 --> 02:25:19.222
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

02:25:19.662 --> 02:25:21.143
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind, I am a cosplayer.

02:25:23.827 --> 02:25:26.788
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we're going to wait until we get a few more answers in.

02:25:26.808 --> 02:25:32.669
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the meantime, this is the song that we wanted to have for our Ask Orange Challenge.

02:25:32.729 --> 02:25:35.089
[SPEAKER_03]: It's The Rabbits with Usao-kun from Keyboard Mania.

02:25:36.709 --> 02:25:38.090
Usao-kun, Usao-kun

02:25:56.464 --> 02:26:24.120
[SPEAKER_10]: Kyou wa okozukai de HAPPY na GUTSU GETTO Demo nani kawuka Mayocchan da yone Genki itai Onaka mo itai Rinrin de herushii time ga Rikkuri time

02:26:42.162 --> 02:26:48.045
[SPEAKER_10]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:27:11.101 --> 02:27:11.542
[SPEAKER_03]: We're back!

02:27:11.602 --> 02:27:12.143
[SPEAKER_03]: We're live!

02:27:12.623 --> 02:27:14.746
[SPEAKER_03]: And our first question comes from 23rebellious.

02:27:15.327 --> 02:27:23.439
[SPEAKER_03]: It said, What would I do with a video of Ron Jeremy and two kawaii Japanese girls in a bucket of chocolate ready whip?

02:27:24.340 --> 02:27:26.063
[SPEAKER_03]: I would go watch the video of Ron Jeremy.

02:27:27.623 --> 02:27:32.007
[SPEAKER_03]: I would send the two kawaii Japanese schoolgirls to go buy me some booze.

02:27:33.728 --> 02:27:36.570
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would eat the bucket of chocolate ready whip.

02:27:37.631 --> 02:27:39.653
[SPEAKER_03]: Did Udo and the bunny taste like chicken or pancakes?

02:27:40.193 --> 02:27:41.054
[SPEAKER_03]: He tasted like rabbit.

02:27:42.675 --> 02:27:45.097
[SPEAKER_03]: And from DarkTensia, who's the most drunk?

02:27:45.257 --> 02:27:45.477
[SPEAKER_03]: Me!

02:27:47.259 --> 02:27:48.700
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you're drunk enough yet.

02:27:48.780 --> 02:27:49.561
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, shit.

02:27:50.722 --> 02:27:52.363
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't fall down the stairs.

02:27:52.383 --> 02:27:56.066
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that, I need...

02:27:56.553 --> 02:27:57.273
[SPEAKER_03]: That fell over.

02:27:57.474 --> 02:27:58.174
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to pick that up.

02:27:59.455 --> 02:28:00.375
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't stare at it.

02:28:00.836 --> 02:28:01.676
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to.

02:28:02.317 --> 02:28:03.697
[SPEAKER_03]: No, don't clean my house.

02:28:04.458 --> 02:28:04.978
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you.

02:28:06.259 --> 02:28:08.000
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, Loki's cleaning my house.

02:28:08.180 --> 02:28:08.740
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.

02:28:09.841 --> 02:28:11.462
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you do Windows?

02:28:13.523 --> 02:28:14.244
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't do Windows.

02:28:15.044 --> 02:28:15.204
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

02:28:21.465 --> 02:28:22.566
[SPEAKER_28]: Do I do Windows?

02:28:22.686 --> 02:28:24.267
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't ask me, I've got the Mac.

02:28:24.347 --> 02:28:26.529
[SPEAKER_28]: My pretty little power book is sitting right here.

02:28:35.836 --> 02:28:36.777
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm a little tipsy.

02:28:38.098 --> 02:28:39.939
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't make me throw my empty flask at you.

02:28:41.420 --> 02:28:41.960
[SPEAKER_28]: Can I keep it?

02:28:42.601 --> 02:28:42.881
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

02:28:46.364 --> 02:28:46.444
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

02:28:48.362 --> 02:28:51.123
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we were doing Ask Orange Challenge, but only two of you people care.

02:28:51.744 --> 02:28:54.105
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we're going to do something else.

02:28:54.545 --> 02:28:56.166
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, we have time for a list list, don't we?

02:28:58.087 --> 02:29:01.748
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well, why don't we do a list list that all four of us can participate in?

02:29:03.449 --> 02:29:10.412
[SPEAKER_03]: How about... Okay, alright.

02:29:10.873 --> 02:29:15.815
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do... For our list list, we're going to do... Favorite Alcohol!

02:29:17.372 --> 02:29:18.813
[SPEAKER_03]: For any reason whatsoever.

02:29:20.213 --> 02:29:21.314
[SPEAKER_03]: Here on Orange House Radio.

02:29:22.074 --> 02:29:24.795
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, we'll go ahead and play more music.

02:29:25.616 --> 02:29:26.556
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I have some.

02:29:26.616 --> 02:29:27.136
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have some.

02:29:27.376 --> 02:29:28.337
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, we have more questions.

02:29:29.077 --> 02:29:29.958
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a cage match this week?

02:29:30.078 --> 02:29:30.938
[SPEAKER_29]: No, because Rob's not here.

02:29:31.838 --> 02:29:32.479
[SPEAKER_03]: Next question.

02:29:33.879 --> 02:29:38.841
[SPEAKER_03]: 23Megas, which is the better oxymoron, Microsoft Works, Legally Drunk, or Military Intelligence?

02:29:39.802 --> 02:29:42.503
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the only one of those that really counts is Military Intelligence.

02:29:42.763 --> 02:29:43.043
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

02:29:44.004 --> 02:29:44.624
[SPEAKER_22]: Honest American.

02:29:46.400 --> 02:29:46.920
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm honest.

02:29:47.780 --> 02:29:50.361
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go up to somebody and tell them that they fucking suck to their face.

02:29:50.721 --> 02:29:50.961
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

02:29:53.082 --> 02:29:54.182
[SPEAKER_25]: Military intelligence.

02:29:54.242 --> 02:29:58.423
[SPEAKER_25]: Our nuclear weapons are in the hands of a man who cannot sing Jingle Bells.

02:29:58.823 --> 02:29:59.704
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a problem with that.

02:30:00.524 --> 02:30:01.744
[SPEAKER_28]: On a different subject, yes.

02:30:02.024 --> 02:30:03.084
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie drives.

02:30:03.685 --> 02:30:10.046
[SPEAKER_28]: And Jamie driving... Driving with Jamie is kind of fun because she will tell everyone that they suck to their faces.

02:30:10.426 --> 02:30:11.527
[SPEAKER_28]: Plus, she will flip them off.

02:30:11.567 --> 02:30:13.147
[SPEAKER_28]: She will, like, speed around them.

02:30:13.187 --> 02:30:14.688
[SPEAKER_28]: If they're slow, she'll just go around them.

02:30:14.768 --> 02:30:15.248
[SPEAKER_28]: It's great.

02:30:15.328 --> 02:30:16.148
[SPEAKER_28]: It's so entertaining.

02:30:18.009 --> 02:30:19.951
[SPEAKER_25]: Jamie isn't called DarkSakura for anything.

02:30:20.292 --> 02:30:26.258
[SPEAKER_25]: She'll rage and demon your ass and then tap dance on your fucking grave like Savian Glover and then laugh at your family.

02:30:26.438 --> 02:30:26.819
[SPEAKER_25]: It's great.

02:30:27.574 --> 02:30:28.354
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like fun.

02:30:28.394 --> 02:30:29.335
[SPEAKER_03]: I should do that next time.

02:30:32.916 --> 02:30:39.379
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I'm going to play a few songs while we come up with what are... Why do people have to get political on Orange Dolls Radio?

02:30:39.459 --> 02:30:39.839
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck them.

02:30:40.199 --> 02:30:41.320
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because we're older than you.

02:30:41.840 --> 02:30:43.561
[SPEAKER_03]: And we actually have something called maturity.

02:30:43.861 --> 02:30:45.642
[SPEAKER_22]: We can freestyle better than you can.

02:30:46.562 --> 02:30:46.942
[SPEAKER_22]: That's it.

02:30:47.482 --> 02:30:49.163
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we can freestyle better than you can.

02:30:49.183 --> 02:30:50.964
[SPEAKER_22]: In both respects.

02:30:51.284 --> 02:30:53.265
[SPEAKER_03]: So, let's go ahead and go.

02:30:53.285 --> 02:30:53.785
[SPEAKER_03]: In both respects.

02:31:18.757 --> 02:31:26.681
[SPEAKER_13]: He knew every magic trick under the sun But he'd forgotten everyone and had some fun Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic

02:31:42.426 --> 02:31:43.147
Thanks for watching!

02:32:05.836 --> 02:32:14.966
[SPEAKER_13]: Smokey and everyone We do every magic trick under the sun Take the gods and everyone and have some fun Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic Monkey Magic, Monkey Magic

02:36:35.468 --> 02:36:36.390
Thanks for watching!

02:37:33.823 --> 02:37:34.523
[SPEAKER_12]: Nico, meow.

02:37:34.724 --> 02:37:35.364
Meow, meow.

02:37:35.464 --> 02:37:36.204
[SPEAKER_12]: Nico, meow.

02:37:36.344 --> 02:37:37.005
[SPEAKER_13]: Meow, meow.

02:37:37.025 --> 02:37:38.025
[SPEAKER_12]: Nico, meow.

02:37:38.245 --> 02:37:39.186
[SPEAKER_12]: Meow, meow.

02:37:39.526 --> 02:37:40.066
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, ass!

02:37:40.627 --> 02:37:43.308
[SPEAKER_12]: This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

02:37:47.250 --> 02:37:47.710
[SPEAKER_03]: We're back.

02:37:49.391 --> 02:37:50.672
[SPEAKER_03]: And we want to say bye to everybody.

02:37:51.913 --> 02:37:55.134
[SPEAKER_24]: Bye-bye, everyone, all the listeners of Orange Lounge.

02:37:55.655 --> 02:37:56.135
[SPEAKER_24]: I am Outer.

02:37:56.175 --> 02:37:57.315
[SPEAKER_24]: I am taking off for the night.

02:37:57.375 --> 02:37:58.056
[SPEAKER_24]: Bye-bye.

02:38:00.294 --> 02:38:00.674
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care.

02:38:00.734 --> 02:38:01.295
[SPEAKER_03]: Drive safely.

02:38:01.655 --> 02:38:03.096
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye, Waifipu.

02:38:03.856 --> 02:38:04.477
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care.

02:38:08.919 --> 02:38:10.060
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we're back.

02:38:10.140 --> 02:38:12.341
[SPEAKER_03]: We've all got our song.

02:38:12.381 --> 02:38:14.903
[SPEAKER_03]: So why don't we just go ahead and we'll start with Loki.

02:38:14.923 --> 02:38:17.184
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your top number three alcohol?

02:38:19.506 --> 02:38:20.646
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I don't drink alcohol.

02:38:21.147 --> 02:38:24.649
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll go with number three being Grog because Monkey Island rules.

02:38:26.903 --> 02:38:28.204
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, number three, Grog.

02:38:28.805 --> 02:38:29.126
[SPEAKER_03]: And yours?

02:38:30.687 --> 02:38:37.535
[SPEAKER_25]: Number three on the tone poll would probably have to be Smirnoff Vanilla Twist Alcohol.

02:38:37.936 --> 02:38:38.616
[SPEAKER_25]: It's good shit.

02:38:39.377 --> 02:38:40.538
[SPEAKER_25]: Perfect for mixing with drinks.

02:38:40.879 --> 02:38:41.740
[SPEAKER_25]: Especially orange juice.

02:38:41.760 --> 02:38:42.120
[SPEAKER_25]: It's good.

02:38:43.882 --> 02:38:44.843
[SPEAKER_03]: Vanilla and orange.

02:38:44.863 --> 02:38:46.085
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't it be like a cream soda, wouldn't it?

02:38:49.178 --> 02:38:51.420
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually did have another participant.

02:38:51.460 --> 02:38:52.901
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go ahead and name my number three.

02:38:53.481 --> 02:38:55.223
[SPEAKER_03]: My number three is Whaler's Vanilla Rum.

02:38:56.203 --> 02:38:56.544
[SPEAKER_03]: Yummy.

02:38:58.345 --> 02:39:02.128
[SPEAKER_25]: I hold Mike now as she types in Whaler's Vanilla Rum, which is probably really good stuff.

02:39:02.388 --> 02:39:04.610
[SPEAKER_25]: Our fourth participant is downstairs.

02:39:05.731 --> 02:39:07.252
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura's going to get her right now.

02:39:08.934 --> 02:39:10.515
[SPEAKER_25]: She's getting the name of her favorite alcohol.

02:39:12.416 --> 02:39:13.117
[SPEAKER_25]: She's picking one.

02:39:16.455 --> 02:39:18.576
[SPEAKER_25]: She's giving her something to drink right now, I don't know.

02:39:20.036 --> 02:39:21.076
[SPEAKER_25]: Everybody!

02:39:23.777 --> 02:39:24.937
[SPEAKER_25]: Everybody!

02:39:25.318 --> 02:39:29.259
[SPEAKER_25]: Wait, here's Melody with her third favorite alcohol.

02:39:29.979 --> 02:39:31.039
[SPEAKER_28]: Vodka, any of it.

02:39:32.379 --> 02:39:33.220
[SPEAKER_25]: Any type of vodka.

02:39:34.580 --> 02:39:36.941
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, number two favorite alcohol, Matt.

02:39:38.361 --> 02:39:40.702
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, this is for Rob because I don't have a number two.

02:39:41.122 --> 02:39:41.942
[SPEAKER_22]: Goldschlager.

02:39:49.502 --> 02:39:51.702
[SPEAKER_25]: Number two would have to be Sapporo Beer.

02:39:52.663 --> 02:39:54.083
[SPEAKER_25]: Sapporo is the best beer.

02:39:54.103 --> 02:39:56.004
[SPEAKER_25]: It has high alcohol content.

02:39:56.024 --> 02:39:57.284
[SPEAKER_25]: It's perfect with sushi.

02:39:57.864 --> 02:40:01.345
[SPEAKER_25]: Especially if you're watching schoolgirls or chicks in maid outfits doing their thing.

02:40:01.385 --> 02:40:01.845
[SPEAKER_25]: It's great.

02:40:01.925 --> 02:40:04.086
[SPEAKER_25]: Or guys in school uniforms.

02:40:04.346 --> 02:40:04.946
[SPEAKER_25]: That's another story.

02:40:04.966 --> 02:40:05.226
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway.

02:40:06.607 --> 02:40:07.647
[SPEAKER_28]: Actually, I take it back.

02:40:08.327 --> 02:40:09.227
[SPEAKER_28]: Rum is number three.

02:40:09.267 --> 02:40:10.127
[SPEAKER_28]: Vodka is number two.

02:40:11.408 --> 02:40:11.848
[SPEAKER_23]: There you go.

02:40:14.432 --> 02:40:18.020
[SPEAKER_03]: My number three is Godiva, of course, chocolate liqueur.

02:40:18.842 --> 02:40:22.149
[SPEAKER_03]: How can, for me, my number two, sorry.

02:40:22.830 --> 02:40:23.291
[SPEAKER_03]: Your number one?

02:40:24.619 --> 02:40:36.343
[SPEAKER_22]: My number one has to be Peppermint Schnapps, because after about a full bottle of that, both my ex-girlfriend and her friend, I think, went lesbian for like the night.

02:40:36.523 --> 02:40:38.524
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I dedicate that to them.

02:40:40.145 --> 02:40:43.286
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, that's one of those things that's going to kick me the rest of my life.

02:40:43.406 --> 02:40:44.086
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I did not.

02:40:44.946 --> 02:40:45.167
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep.

02:40:45.587 --> 02:40:47.567
[SPEAKER_22]: So, we think.

02:40:47.627 --> 02:40:48.148
[SPEAKER_22]: We don't know.

02:40:48.168 --> 02:40:51.729
[SPEAKER_22]: They disappeared into my room for a while, and they don't remember anything that went on.

02:40:53.880 --> 02:40:54.480
[SPEAKER_22]: So they say.

02:40:55.881 --> 02:41:02.205
[SPEAKER_25]: If your ex-girlfriend and girlfriend ever disappear into a room under the influence of alcohol, you better be up in that motherfucker.

02:41:03.226 --> 02:41:04.947
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, ex-girlfriend and her friend.

02:41:05.487 --> 02:41:08.309
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, she was my girlfriend at the time, so yeah, I should have, but...

02:41:08.942 --> 02:41:12.164
[SPEAKER_25]: I would have been all over that like a bad rash on Pamela Anderson Lee.

02:41:12.524 --> 02:41:16.887
[SPEAKER_25]: Number one would have to be the Godiva soy milk combination that I had tonight with DarkSakura.

02:41:16.927 --> 02:41:17.788
[SPEAKER_25]: That's the new number one.

02:41:17.848 --> 02:41:19.769
[SPEAKER_25]: Goes down smooth and goddamn, I'm buzzin'.

02:41:20.309 --> 02:41:24.792
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm so numb that somebody could cut my arm off and beat me with it and I would not feel it.

02:41:24.852 --> 02:41:28.895
[SPEAKER_28]: First off, listen, hey Jamie, you wanna go in that room five feet away and lock the door?

02:41:29.275 --> 02:41:31.917
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, you know, they did say that after I got socially drunk I'd turn lesbian.

02:41:32.457 --> 02:41:33.258
[SPEAKER_28]: Woohoo.

02:41:33.738 --> 02:41:34.198
[SPEAKER_28]: Woohoo.

02:41:34.218 --> 02:41:36.460
[SPEAKER_23]: Remember, don't say unless you mean it!

02:41:37.180 --> 02:41:38.321
[SPEAKER_23]: I want photos!

02:41:39.114 --> 02:41:44.936
[SPEAKER_28]: And my number one has to be that Vermeer chocolate liqueur that Mel gave me because good lord that shit is good.

02:41:45.797 --> 02:41:47.017
[SPEAKER_28]: V-E-R-M-E-E-R.

02:41:47.857 --> 02:41:50.318
[SPEAKER_28]: It's Dutch chocolate liqueur and you can get it at Safeway.

02:41:50.618 --> 02:41:51.039
[SPEAKER_28]: Best ever.

02:41:51.499 --> 02:41:56.020
[SPEAKER_25]: Shouts out to Felix the Friendly Traveler for providing the alcohol at DistortedEchoes.com.

02:41:56.040 --> 02:42:00.082
[SPEAKER_25]: Go pick up any project that Lawrence Trifon and Felix the Friendly Traveler do because that's dope shit.

02:42:00.402 --> 02:42:01.502
[SPEAKER_25]: Felix, you may never know.

02:42:01.522 --> 02:42:02.323
[SPEAKER_25]: 2003, I could come back.

02:42:03.977 --> 02:42:08.439
[SPEAKER_03]: My number one would be Just Desserts brand creme brulee liqueur.

02:42:09.500 --> 02:42:10.720
[SPEAKER_03]: You get it at Trader Joe's.

02:42:10.781 --> 02:42:12.141
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the only place I've seen that one.

02:42:12.782 --> 02:42:15.603
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like $6 a bottle and it tastes like it should cost more.

02:42:15.643 --> 02:42:16.824
[SPEAKER_03]: That stuff is the best.

02:42:16.844 --> 02:42:20.525
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you want to go ahead and vote off one?

02:42:23.107 --> 02:42:24.027
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

02:42:24.708 --> 02:42:27.709
[SPEAKER_22]: Just because someone else is going to vote it off and I'll just save them the time.

02:42:27.749 --> 02:42:28.129
[SPEAKER_22]: Grog.

02:42:28.309 --> 02:42:33.032
[SPEAKER_22]: Because that's a stupid third pick by me and I just don't care.

02:42:33.152 --> 02:42:33.452
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm tired.

02:42:36.497 --> 02:42:45.122
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, we have to get rid of the Sopro, even though it's one of my favorites, because it is a... I put it on there, but in comparison to the other alcohols, it's a beer.

02:42:45.622 --> 02:42:47.403
[SPEAKER_25]: And beer just doesn't stand up to liquor.

02:42:47.923 --> 02:42:51.285
[SPEAKER_25]: Although it is an acquired taste, liquor has more of a flavor to it.

02:42:51.645 --> 02:42:55.127
[SPEAKER_25]: You can't mix liquor... You can mix liquor with anything, you can't mix beer with anything.

02:42:55.607 --> 02:42:59.049
[SPEAKER_28]: So... Vote one off the island.

02:43:01.170 --> 02:43:01.850
[SPEAKER_28]: Uh, Jerry!

02:43:02.010 --> 02:43:04.912
[SPEAKER_28]: No, um... Um, what are our options?

02:43:04.992 --> 02:43:05.512
[SPEAKER_11]: American Idol!

02:43:06.208 --> 02:43:13.129
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm saying rum because even though I voted it on, I got really freaking drunk on it once and it made me unhappy.

02:43:13.770 --> 02:43:15.290
[SPEAKER_03]: God, everyone's voting their own shit off.

02:43:15.650 --> 02:43:16.850
[SPEAKER_03]: You left the light on in the bathroom.

02:43:17.170 --> 02:43:17.710
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's why.

02:43:18.170 --> 02:43:18.371
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

02:43:20.011 --> 02:43:21.251
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm going to vote off?

02:43:22.691 --> 02:43:23.692
[SPEAKER_03]: Peppermint schnapps!

02:43:25.832 --> 02:43:30.733
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've had peppermint schnapps before and I thought it was going to kill me.

02:43:30.833 --> 02:43:31.853
[SPEAKER_03]: It tasted like burning.

02:43:32.893 --> 02:43:35.434
[SPEAKER_03]: It tasted like burning heat.

02:43:39.728 --> 02:43:41.409
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what they felt that night.

02:43:43.049 --> 02:43:43.570
[SPEAKER_22]: God damn it.

02:43:44.130 --> 02:43:52.534
[SPEAKER_22]: You see, Peppermint Schnoss, man, that shit got my ex-girlfriend to yell, I can suck his dick and you can't, arguing with her friend.

02:43:53.374 --> 02:43:55.795
[SPEAKER_03]: I just heard you say that you can suck someone's dick.

02:43:56.535 --> 02:43:59.176
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I was quoting my ex-girlfriend, okay?

02:44:00.197 --> 02:44:03.578
[SPEAKER_25]: There's absolutely nothing wrong with sucking dick as long as the person is clean.

02:44:03.618 --> 02:44:04.839
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's not get that twisted.

02:44:05.766 --> 02:44:09.949
[SPEAKER_25]: Although I don't know about Loki's sex life, the guy's cute enough, but that's another story too.

02:44:10.470 --> 02:44:12.471
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't say that shit while I've been drinking.

02:44:13.952 --> 02:44:16.894
[SPEAKER_22]: We're fucking listening, so obviously you only caught the last half.

02:44:17.755 --> 02:44:19.716
[SPEAKER_25]: I still want Gak's sexy body, but anyway.

02:44:20.337 --> 02:44:22.138
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh, do I get to vote another one off now, or?

02:44:23.979 --> 02:44:24.160
[SPEAKER_13]: Ow!

02:44:25.681 --> 02:44:26.001
[SPEAKER_13]: Bitch.

02:44:28.523 --> 02:44:29.003
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

02:44:30.184 --> 02:44:32.726
[SPEAKER_03]: Chatroom, this is where you decide.

02:44:33.957 --> 02:44:35.838
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God, I didn't mean too loud.

02:44:35.978 --> 02:44:37.278
[SPEAKER_03]: Too loud, I didn't mean too loud.

02:44:39.058 --> 02:44:43.700
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you've got a few minutes to send me your votes.

02:44:44.780 --> 02:44:46.280
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't send me your votes, I kill you!

02:44:46.781 --> 02:44:47.881
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, wait, I don't kill you.

02:44:47.901 --> 02:44:49.001
[SPEAKER_03]: You're so stupid!

02:44:50.522 --> 02:44:56.523
[SPEAKER_03]: Send me your votes, and in the meantime, just to make Jahi happy, we're gonna play MC Hawking.

02:44:56.983 --> 02:44:59.364
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, if you want MC Hawking to end,

02:45:00.004 --> 02:45:03.245
[SPEAKER_03]: Send in your vote for best liquor.

02:45:04.546 --> 02:45:07.247
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to re-read the list and I'm going to post it into the chat room.

02:45:08.367 --> 02:45:09.167
[SPEAKER_03]: Just give me a second.

02:45:09.207 --> 02:45:10.248
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I'm so uncoordinated.

02:45:12.208 --> 02:45:14.569
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I stay vaguely coherent when I'm alcoholic.

02:45:14.609 --> 02:45:15.009
[SPEAKER_03]: When I'm drunk.

02:45:23.217 --> 02:45:25.158
[SPEAKER_03]: It won't let me paste it into the freaking chat room.

02:45:25.778 --> 02:45:26.299
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there we go.

02:45:26.419 --> 02:45:26.779
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn.

02:45:26.899 --> 02:45:27.119
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

02:45:28.540 --> 02:45:29.720
[SPEAKER_03]: So vote for one of those.

02:45:30.761 --> 02:45:33.002
[SPEAKER_03]: You have, um, how long is this song?

02:45:33.602 --> 02:45:34.303
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, shit.

02:45:34.663 --> 02:45:36.424
[SPEAKER_03]: Three minutes and twenty-five seconds.

02:45:37.124 --> 02:45:38.545
[SPEAKER_03]: Vote now, or die.

02:45:38.565 --> 02:45:45.589
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, yeah.

02:45:45.789 --> 02:45:47.529
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, motherfuckers.

02:45:49.430 --> 02:45:51.552
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm back, riding a funky track.

02:45:52.925 --> 02:45:55.847
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a story to tell you all, so listen up.

02:45:57.307 --> 02:45:58.788
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, trip on this.

02:46:00.749 --> 02:46:02.830
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm rolling through the boat on a Saturday night.

02:46:02.910 --> 02:46:10.054
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a 40 in my left hand, dick in my right, some cronk in my left, a pager in my hat, and a 9mm in the small of my back.

02:46:10.194 --> 02:46:12.014
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just chilling no place to be.

02:46:12.315 --> 02:46:14.416
[SPEAKER_01]: I take another blow off my 40Z.

02:46:14.576 --> 02:46:16.837
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking about skinning a fat ass tree.

02:46:17.017 --> 02:46:18.698
[SPEAKER_01]: A B to the L to the U-N-T.

02:46:19.338 --> 02:46:41.410
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I get a call on my dope cell phone, check the caller ID, plug up Holmes, yo it's the Doom and his news ain't good I feel like the world is fading away, I saw little Pookie just the other day, Pookie was my boy we shitted Kool-Aid in the park, now some punks took his life in the dark, I asked Doomsday who the motherfuckers be, some punk ass bitch from MIT

02:46:42.310 --> 02:47:01.638
[SPEAKER_01]: The fucking Institute, man I should've known I say meet me at my crib and hang up the phone Playtime's over, I got a job to do And the world will be less crowded by the time I move And I'll keep rolling while bullets fly Cause all my shootings be drive-bys Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't drop bars Don't, don't, don't, don't drop bars

02:47:14.034 --> 02:47:40.607
[SPEAKER_01]: One minute to midnight, we hit the street, cold as a cadaver, hard as concrete Doomsday's hacking, Baby Mac got my AK-47 and the 9 in my bag The Alpine's blowing, PE's blowing, got my swerve on tight and my game face showing Them damn punks are gonna pay, the hawks on the case, a bird of prey Then up ahead, cold chilling in the street, 6 motherfuckers from MIT I flick off the safety, check my grip, and bloat

02:47:41.207 --> 02:48:10.019
[SPEAKER_01]: A dumb dumb clip, I glance at the Doom to make sure he's hacked His fingers on the traitor of his baby mech Time to give a Newtonian demonstration Of a bullet, it's mass and it's acceleration Dying on my lap, AK in my hand I roll up slow, like a snake in the sand I wait till I'm sure they can see my face Then I bust out slugs to the beat of the bass Streets sketched out in the full moonlight MIT punks dying left and right There's nowhere to run, don't even try Cause all my shootings be drive-bys

02:48:14.424 --> 02:48:14.986
[SPEAKER_07]: Broadbite

02:48:30.683 --> 02:48:50.533
[SPEAKER_01]: Then silence hits the street like a bomb, and eerie calm like the eye of a storm Beneath the glow of an old streetlight, dab MIT punks in the only sight Six motherfuckers no longer alive, cookies in a bench, one for one plus five And we'll be long gone before the cops arrive, cause all my shootings being drive-bys Hi-ya!

02:48:51.073 --> 02:48:54.535
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm busting more shit than an incontinent man at a chili cook-off

02:48:55.934 --> 02:49:02.318
[SPEAKER_01]: The moral of the story is, don't fuck with the Hawkman, cause the Hawkman ain't dealt with an eye for an eye for shit.

02:49:02.799 --> 02:49:03.579
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck that.

02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:07.162
[SPEAKER_01]: Take an eye, and I'll take your motherfucking head.

02:49:24.568 --> 02:49:30.352
[SPEAKER_06]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

02:49:33.934 --> 02:49:36.915
[SPEAKER_17]: We're back.

02:49:37.176 --> 02:49:38.256
[SPEAKER_03]: We almost have winners.

02:49:38.616 --> 02:49:40.858
[SPEAKER_03]: In the meantime, though, we're going to give the microphone to Jackie to rant for a while.

02:49:41.917 --> 02:49:42.477
[SPEAKER_25]: Cool.

02:49:42.878 --> 02:49:43.838
[SPEAKER_25]: I get to rant.

02:49:44.779 --> 02:49:45.579
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know if it's a rant.

02:49:45.599 --> 02:49:47.521
[SPEAKER_25]: They're discussing the alcohols right now.

02:49:49.022 --> 02:49:50.262
[SPEAKER_25]: They're doing rock, paper, scissors.

02:49:50.743 --> 02:49:51.943
[SPEAKER_25]: They're still making a decision.

02:49:53.184 --> 02:49:55.426
[SPEAKER_25]: If we have an afterbirth tonight, I might kick some shit.

02:49:55.466 --> 02:49:55.886
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

02:49:56.286 --> 02:49:57.987
[SPEAKER_25]: That was MC Hawking on the last track.

02:49:58.007 --> 02:50:00.989
[SPEAKER_25]: One of the hardest motherfuckers I know with all my shootings being drive-bys.

02:50:01.810 --> 02:50:03.271
[SPEAKER_25]: And I wouldn't fuck with him because he'll shoot you.

02:50:04.291 --> 02:50:05.672
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well we have our three winners.

02:50:06.272 --> 02:50:06.773
[SPEAKER_03]: Number three...

02:50:08.516 --> 02:50:11.458
[SPEAKER_03]: Godiva and Vanilla Soy Milk combo.

02:50:11.558 --> 02:50:13.220
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get another one right now.

02:50:13.900 --> 02:50:17.063
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't drink up all the Godiva though.

02:50:17.143 --> 02:50:19.765
[SPEAKER_03]: Second place is Smirnoff Vanilla Twist Alcohol.

02:50:21.046 --> 02:50:23.007
[SPEAKER_03]: And number one is Godiva.

02:50:23.748 --> 02:50:25.309
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

02:50:25.329 --> 02:50:28.952
[SPEAKER_03]: None of those people had Vermeer.

02:50:29.552 --> 02:50:31.193
[SPEAKER_03]: The Vermeer though is pretty kickass.

02:50:31.273 --> 02:50:32.434
[SPEAKER_03]: I just couldn't think of how to say it.

02:50:32.474 --> 02:50:33.395
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't want to misspell it.

02:50:34.656 --> 02:50:35.416
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's me.

02:50:38.277 --> 02:50:40.099
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we've got two minutes left in the show.

02:50:41.720 --> 02:50:42.140
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

02:50:42.480 --> 02:50:43.922
[SPEAKER_03]: You had something you wanted to talk about, right?

02:50:45.163 --> 02:50:45.663
[SPEAKER_22]: I guess.

02:50:46.624 --> 02:50:49.026
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, yeah, sum it up in a few seconds.

02:50:49.506 --> 02:50:54.830
[SPEAKER_22]: Guy makes 2600 Atari game of DDR type thing.

02:50:55.070 --> 02:50:55.831
[SPEAKER_22]: Sucks ass.

02:50:56.031 --> 02:50:56.331
[SPEAKER_22]: The end.

02:50:57.953 --> 02:50:59.154
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we know where this can be found?

02:51:00.435 --> 02:51:00.635
[SPEAKER_22]: Nope.

02:51:01.095 --> 02:51:01.936
[SPEAKER_22]: Can't remember offhand.

02:51:03.396 --> 02:51:05.717
[SPEAKER_03]: You see that box there with the mushrooms on the lid?

02:51:06.658 --> 02:51:14.822
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are 2600 ROMs and they're actually game chips and a thing to play them on a 2600.

02:51:14.882 --> 02:51:15.023
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

02:51:15.083 --> 02:51:20.025
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Custer's Revenge is in there somewhere.

02:51:23.127 --> 02:51:23.547
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

02:51:24.628 --> 02:51:26.089
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm real interested.

02:51:27.129 --> 02:51:28.190
[SPEAKER_28]: Pixelated penis!

02:51:29.505 --> 02:51:31.627
[SPEAKER_02]: Custer's Revenge is so funny.

02:51:32.248 --> 02:51:32.608
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

02:51:32.968 --> 02:51:33.969
[SPEAKER_02]: Custer's Revenge.

02:51:34.950 --> 02:51:35.151
[SPEAKER_02]: For the 2600.

02:51:35.351 --> 02:51:37.273
[SPEAKER_02]: The porn game.

02:51:38.914 --> 02:51:41.497
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

02:51:42.318 --> 02:51:43.038
[SPEAKER_03]: Custer.

02:51:43.699 --> 02:51:44.079
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

02:51:47.042 --> 02:51:49.365
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you ever see the one called X-Man?

02:51:50.426 --> 02:51:52.348
[SPEAKER_03]: It was this guy who was scissors.

02:51:54.296 --> 02:51:55.997
[SPEAKER_03]: The Sky Running Through A Maze

02:52:10.660 --> 02:52:12.681
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like pixelated cock and everything.

02:52:12.741 --> 02:52:15.442
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really, really scary and really wrong.

02:52:16.123 --> 02:52:19.864
[SPEAKER_03]: And anyway, on the note of pixelated cock, I think that we should go ahead and end this bit of rain, right?

02:52:19.884 --> 02:52:20.585
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you know what?

02:52:21.345 --> 02:52:24.066
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I'm going to do very well at a drunk show next time.

02:52:24.106 --> 02:52:25.107
[SPEAKER_03]: We wait until Rob's here.

02:52:25.807 --> 02:52:27.888
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll drink and let him be the sober one.

02:52:27.928 --> 02:52:29.569
[SPEAKER_25]: Just give me the afterbirth part.

02:52:29.869 --> 02:52:30.970
[SPEAKER_25]: Just give me the afterbirth part.

02:52:30.990 --> 02:52:31.890
[SPEAKER_25]: That's disgusting.

02:52:32.390 --> 02:52:34.611
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, yeah, but I can be disgusting.

02:52:35.312 --> 02:52:38.313
[SPEAKER_03]: So why don't we go ahead and say our final thoughts for the evening, Loki?

02:52:39.488 --> 02:52:41.230
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm tired and I need to work on my website.

02:52:42.331 --> 02:52:42.852
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes you do.

02:52:43.433 --> 02:52:43.773
[SPEAKER_28]: Melody.

02:52:44.614 --> 02:52:44.934
[SPEAKER_28]: Catch.

02:52:47.257 --> 02:52:50.601
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry out there to all you people who just got like an ear full of futon.

02:52:53.465 --> 02:52:53.725
Jahi.

02:52:55.629 --> 02:52:58.371
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a certain someone I'm waiting to get me a call on Valentine's Day.

02:52:58.411 --> 02:52:59.532
[SPEAKER_25]: Hope she calls me.

02:53:00.053 --> 02:53:02.795
[SPEAKER_25]: Motherfuck Puff Daddy and a ton of other people in the industry.

02:53:03.316 --> 02:53:04.296
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm bitter, goddammit.

02:53:04.336 --> 02:53:05.157
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck Walmart.

02:53:05.217 --> 02:53:06.578
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck a whole bunch of other people.

02:53:07.099 --> 02:53:09.181
[SPEAKER_25]: Godiva and Soy Milk is really good.

02:53:09.281 --> 02:53:14.765
[SPEAKER_25]: Thanks to Jamie for allowing me to speak on OrangeLounge.com.

02:53:15.386 --> 02:53:18.268
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's it.

02:53:19.469 --> 02:53:20.070
[SPEAKER_03]: Sadly enough...

02:53:20.811 --> 02:53:23.393
[SPEAKER_03]: After, what, did I have like five or six drinks?

02:53:24.374 --> 02:53:28.678
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still not, I'm still not drunk that bad.

02:53:29.599 --> 02:53:35.624
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, so... I wish I could go to the strip club, but that's a lot of money and I don't have the money.

02:53:39.087 --> 02:53:39.447
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go.

02:53:39.467 --> 02:53:42.890
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so let's go ahead and end this train wreck.

02:53:42.910 --> 02:53:45.993
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay tuned, though, for a special messy surprise.

02:53:49.423 --> 02:53:52.485
